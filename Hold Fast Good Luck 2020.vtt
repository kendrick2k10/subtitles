3
00:00:21.586 --> 00:00:22.587
Fuck sake.

4
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.633
Look. if things are shitty.

5
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:26.461
they kind of have
to get better. right?

6
00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.376
Like. bounce back.

7
00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.031
Once you hit bottom.
there's only up to go.
that sort of thing.

8
00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:32.293
You know. like physics.

9
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.643
I don't think it works like that
in this case.

10
00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:36.297
I'm pretty sure things
can get worse.

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.256
Yeah. maybe physics doesn't apply for emotional well-being.

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.692
but you get what I mean.

13
00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.433
Mm. I don't think so.

14
00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:45.654
I feel like things can actually
get worse once they're worse

15
00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:47.438
and then they continue
to get worse

16
00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.571
until it's not funny anymore
and then they get
a little better

17
00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:51.312
and then they get worse again.
and then you die.

18
00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.968
So. uh. Laura... you okay?

19
00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:59.320
Yeah. just everyone
keeps asking what I'm doing next

20
00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:00.973
and it's like. I don't know.

21
00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:06.109
So. yeah. that's fun.

22
00:01:06.153 --> 00:01:08.894
Well. hey. at least
you're done with that job

23
00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.332
and taking some time off.
starting fresh.

24
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:12.246
That's great!

25
00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.769
Yeah. there's that.

26
00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:15.379
It's going to be okay.

27
00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:16.685
I don't know.

28
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:18.817
It's gonna be alright.

29
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.125
It's not like anybody
chooses to move to Los Angeles

30
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.127
because they were pumped
on their lives beforehand.

31
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:26.086
I was born there
so I guess I can't really say.

32
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:29.480
Best case scenario.
they get the idea like myself

33
00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:30.916
that maybe they can
make some change

34
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.005
through art or some shit.

35
00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.008
So. I take it
you're pretty happy
with things these days.

36
00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:37.445
Super fucking pumped.

37
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.798
You're just a radiant
bundle of sunshine.
aren't you. Michael?

38
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.714
Everything's bad all the time.

39
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:47.498
Oh. yeah. you're so edgy.

40
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.069
Come on.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

41
00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.655
This is my room.

42
00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:15.178
You have roommates. right?

43
00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.702
Yes. of course I have roommates.
It's San Francisco.

44
00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:19.400
Nobody's rich enough
not to have roommates.

45
00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:20.879
It's nice. right?

46
00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:22.925
Yeah. it's like... I mean.
I take it works really well.

47
00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:25.232
Yeah. well. it's fun.

48
00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:28.017
-Yeah. it's fun.
-Is it?

49
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.280
Yeah. it's just...
it takes some time.

50
00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:31.673
Like all of it.

51
00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.153
Yeah. your early 20's. right?

52
00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:35.198
Yeah. hopefully
I'll at least have some stories.

53
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.462
-Where's Neha?
-Oh. fuck! That's right.

54
00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:41.204
She's like picking up a friend
or a friend of a friend
or something.

55
00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:43.206
I don't know. but I think
she's bringing people.

56
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.426
-People?
-Guys.

57
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.256
-Couple of guys.

58
00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.997
All right. let's get drunk.

59
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.261
Yeah.

60
00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:56.741
That doesn't even
sound fun. Frank.

61
00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.134
Yeah. that's 'cause it wasn't.

62
00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.353
Then why?

63
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.747
I don't know.

64
00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:04.532
Sometimes things
just sound like a good idea
when you're drinking.

65
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.229
But really. your ex?

66
00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:08.318
That is the clichÃ©.

67
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:11.495
It's like you could be
a little more original
with your fuck-ups. dude.

68
00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.889
-I could.
- That is pretty bad.

69
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:18.198
You know guys.
as much as I appreciate
the concern. I don't.

70
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:21.462
And either way.
she didn't answer
and I didn't leave a voice mail.

71
00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:22.637
so we chillin'

72
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.594
Yeah. totally chillin'.

73
00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:26.206
Yeah. totally chillin'

74
00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.861
-I'm going to tell your mother
that you're being rude.
-You are my mother. Neha.

75
00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:31.515
and I'm sorry for talking back.

76
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.648
No. I'm not. Fuck you.

77
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:35.171
You little bitch!

78
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.085
Neha!

79
00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:36.999
Ro!

80
00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:38.653
-Friends!
- Ro!

81
00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:40.959
Ro?

82
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:44.267
Yeah. so this is
Frank and Michael.

83
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:45.921
Hi. Frank. Hi. Michael.

84
00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:48.663
-Whoa! There's your door.
-Windy out!

85
00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.491
I'm Frank. that's Michael.

86
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.014
I'm Michael and that's Frank.

87
00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.190
-Frank. Michael. Cool. got it.
-Yeah. No. no. Frank...

88
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.540
-We're doing a hug. Come on in.
-Oh. this is going really well.

89
00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:57.628
Stop.

90
00:03:57.672 --> 00:03:59.369
Hell. yeah. Laura.

91
00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:01.371
Like are you looking
for roommates by any chance?

92
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.112
No. I'm not. Frank.

93
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:06.289
Are you so excited
you travelled.
you little adventurer?

94
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:09.771
Yeah. I'm so excited.
yeah. excited. woo!

95
00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:11.381
-Well. what's going on?
- You guys want beer?

96
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:12.426
Yes.

97
00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.558
Yeah. so this is
Michael and Frank.

98
00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:16.168
-Hey. Michael and Frank.
-Hey.

99
00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.344
-Which one's which?
- Oh. my bad.

100
00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:18.432
Uh. Michael.

101
00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:19.520
-Michael.
-Yeah.

102
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.217
-Frank.
-Have we met before?

103
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.132
Yeah. I think so.

104
00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:25.830
Oh. my God! No. dude.
it's when you came up
for your 21st birthday.

105
00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:29.530
-What? I'm pretty sure
I was blitzed that whole time.
-You were.

106
00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:30.835
Wait!

107
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.577
Oh. holy shit!
You were with that... that dude.

108
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:36.624
The one that kept trying to get
us to ditch you girls because...

109
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.061
-Oh. my God!
-...Saturdays were for the boys.

110
00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:40.410
-Shit! That was awesome.
-Yeah.

111
00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:42.020
-Yeah.
-He was super awesome.

112
00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:45.285
That was definitely awesome.
Puka shells?

113
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.025
Yeah. nice to meet you guys too.

114
00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.726
Anyway. here's something
about good health
or something. right?

115
00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:53.380
-Yeah. take it.
-Fuck dying. right?

116
00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:54.381
Ooh!

117
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:59.995
It was such an eloquent toast
from you all. I'm so inspired.

118
00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:01.866
So. this girl tells me

119
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.042
that she wants to be buried
in one of those tree urns
when she goes.

120
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:05.522
Who are you dating?

121
00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:07.394
And I'm like...
oh. I have great taste in women.

122
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:09.396
you should just ask Michael.

123
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.181
Oh. yeah.
You and Laura should start
the saddest dating app ever.

124
00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:14.966
- Nice.
-We'd be millionaires.

125
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.360
Like you have
like that one bad ex.

126
00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:19.362
-No. never. Not once.
-All right.

127
00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:21.016
Frank. aren't you
telling a story?

128
00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.539
Oh. yeah. okay. anyhow.

129
00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.194
So. then I told her
that when I go.

130
00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:28.632
I want my ashes
to be shot out of the ocean
out of a t-shirt cannon.

131
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:30.242
Out of the ocean though?

132
00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.245
Into the ocean with a t-shirt
cannon. sorry. I can't talk.

133
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.335
But. yeah. I think that...
What's that? What did you say?

134
00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:37.511
Well. you said
out of the ocean and I was like
who are you going to give...

135
00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.469
No. I'm going to give it
to a mermaid and she's going
to shoot it out of the ocean...

136
00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:41.515
-Guys. we can go.
it's turning green.
-We can go? Oh. okay.

137
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.821
Well. no. but then
I was like. "I want to go
to Davy Jones' locker.

138
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.301
Like I'm a fuckin'
pirate. baby!"

139
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.956
Whatever. like the world
is filled with mean people.

140
00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.132
You're cheery.

141
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.961
Yeah. well. okay.
but the point is like nobody
thinks they're mean. right?

142
00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:54.789
Like and then
all of these mean people...

143
00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:57.095
Well. actually
all of us mean people

144
00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.272
go around using
other people's meanness
just for our meanness.

145
00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:02.318
-So. it's like...
-Is she always this sad?

146
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.624
Usually much sadder.

147
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.408
Oh. okay. Then good.

148
00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:08.063
People are exactly
the reason why people
can't have nice things.

149
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:10.587
- Yeah. what?
- Who do you mean?

150
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:13.329
-I don't know. people.
-Yeah. well. like not everybody.

151
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.983
- Well. yeah. okay.
-Most people.

152
00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:18.639
It's kinda how it goes.
People are going to people.

153
00:06:18.682 --> 00:06:20.118
That's... Yeah. exactly.

154
00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:21.511
I should know better by now.

155
00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:23.121
Well. you can't blame
yourself for that.

156
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.341
I mean. you can
but you shouldn't.

157
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.389
It sounds a little like
you really don't like the fact
that you see good in people.

158
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.479
Ooh!

159
00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:33.871
What?

160
00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:42.010
Hey.

161
00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.055
Hey.
where did everybody go?

162
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.580
Um. Ro and Neha
went for a smoke.

163
00:06:46.623 --> 00:06:49.496
I don't know if Frank smokes
but he went with them. so...

164
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.934
Yeah. sometimes
we all have our vices.

165
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.601
Glad that we got that
out of the way.

166
00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:10.995
-That's it?
-Just taking a break.

167
00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:16.479
Woo! Ow!

168
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:22.659
Neha hasn't said
one word since we got her food.

169
00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:26.968
Fuck you! I'm trying to enjoy
my food and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me.

170
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.404
Yeah. fuck you. Frank.

171
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.753
Oh. come on. Jesus!

172
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:32.408
You know you can
just buy a slice. right?

173
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.628
I could. but I could
also have a bite of yours.

174
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.500
-I think she's just using me
for my pizza. guys.
-One bite. come on.

175
00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:38.501
-All right.
- Definitely.

176
00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:39.720
All right.
Be careful. it's hot.

177
00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:42.157
Okay.
What did you do to this pizza?

178
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.375
-I bit it.
- Murderer!

179
00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:44.594
Fuck. that's hot!

180
00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:46.248
You all right?

181
00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:51.166
So. is it that bad?

182
00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.516
Let's get this thing right here.

183
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.518
Why is it so hot?

184
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.607
Why are you eating it?
They just said it's hot.

185
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:59.740
Why are you trying to eat it?
They just said it's hot.

186
00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:01.959
Once second.
could you repeat that
for a photograph?

187
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:04.701
They're going
to go through life

188
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.051
with just like the tiniest bit
of doubt and questioning

189
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:09.532
about whether they really
are part cyborg or not

190
00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:12.666
and then one day in college.

191
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.885
they'll finally discover
that it's obviously not true

192
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:16.278
and they've just been lying
to them the whole time.

193
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:18.759
And what. the lesson is
to just never trust anyone

194
00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:20.587
'cause your father
is a sadistic liar

195
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.327
and you should
just never trust anybody?

196
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.374
Yeah. exactly. Ro. you get me.

197
00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:28.551
The world is a bad.
bad place and you should
just never trust anybody.

198
00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:30.771
Aside from the fact
that your kids are going to be
super fucked up in the head.

199
00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:32.947
they'll just be like
cutting their arm open.

200
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.515
like looking
for cyborg parts and shit.

201
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.604
Well. yeah.
I mean those are minor details

202
00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:39.344
but it's a great plan though.
right?

203
00:08:39.388 --> 00:08:41.433
And Michael is the one
that gave me the idea for it.

204
00:08:41.477 --> 00:08:45.394
Okay. look. just to be clear.
I never condoned for it
to go for this long.

205
00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:47.527
How did this even come up?

206
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.704
Uh. me and Frank were having
a conversation about how parents
fuck up their kids.

207
00:08:50.747 --> 00:08:52.836
-Oh. yeah. as one does.
-Yeah. as one does.

208
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.098
Are your parents divorced?

209
00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:56.797
Ooh. and the conversation
takes a turn.

210
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.842
We live in the future now.
of course they are.

211
00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.191
Love is dead and all that shit.

212
00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:02.933
Oh. yeah. I'm Michael.
I have a dark soul.

213
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:04.065
Yada-yada-yada.

214
00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:06.154
I love
when Neha talks shit.

215
00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:08.025
Yes. I'm an asshole.
I agree with that.

216
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.637
but I know for a fact
that you all hate your jobs.

217
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.030
Aside from the part where
it just kinda dominates my life.

218
00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:14.728
I actually enjoy my job. Yep.

219
00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:17.644
Ro! I love you.

220
00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:19.950
That's kinda like
really unhealthy. Right?

221
00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:21.778
No. I mean no. I get it.

222
00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:25.303
It's pretty much the same
for me. but I don't know.
I still love it.

223
00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:27.044
What is it
that you do again?

224
00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:29.003
-I work...
-I think they're broken.

225
00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:32.963
I work at a hospital
as a Strategic
Advancement Director.

226
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.443
Silly business.

227
00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:35.662
Uh. yeah.

228
00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:38.273
Wait. wait.
Your job acronym is S.A.D.

229
00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.753
It's like literally. sad.

230
00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:43.191
Ah. it is.
I never realized that.

231
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.846
You know what?
I kinda love that.

232
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:49.458
Oh my God! If you say you love
your job one more time.
I might actually believe you.

233
00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:55.856
I love my job as a Strategic
Advancement Director

234
00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.642
for a remote hospital
in the boonies of California.

235
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.253
-Well. all right.
-You guys are fucking weird.

236
00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:04.038
And you guys
are fucking hippies.

237
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:06.518
Okay. that's like
the meanest thing
that anyone's ever said to me.

238
00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:07.737
That was pretty sick.

239
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.130
-Right?
-What?

240
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:12.568
Fellow job lover Ro.
what do you do?

241
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.222
I'm an assistant.

242
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.180
Obviously. a good one.

243
00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:19.488
Well. it's nice to have
something to show
considering the hours and stuff.

244
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:23.579
Yeah. like I don't know.
How do you guys know
that you love your jobs? Just...

245
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.103
I don't know. Shit's just tight.

246
00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:28.453
-Yeah.
-Meanwhile on this couch. oh...

247
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:31.369
Oh!

248
00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:35.286
And the award
for the saddest high five
of the evening goes to...

249
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.593
-Oh! Gross.
-Hey boo. that's not fair.

250
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.116
-Oh. my God!
-Get a room.

251
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.640
-Come on. girl.
-Neha's watching!

252
00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:43.643
-She's never watched that.

253
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.733
Ow!

254
00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.386
That was definitely your fault.

255
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.561
Are you kidding?

256
00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:52.129
No. that was like
a hundred percent you.

257
00:10:52.173 --> 00:10:55.045
No. you're the one
that was on top
and then you started to fall...

258
00:10:56.264 --> 00:10:58.962
Oh. did you just kiss me
to shut me up?

259
00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:01.661
No. I kissed you to kiss you
but that was a very nice bonus.

260
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:05.621
You're such a brat. Oh!

261
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.450
All right. that was fun.
See you around.

262
00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:10.931
Yeah. cool. See you later.

263
00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:15.370
-I'm kidding.
-I'm not.

264
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.288
I'm kidding?

265
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.726
I promise.

266
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.773
You know. it works better
if you don't say it
like a question.

267
00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:28.035
I know.

268
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:36.478
You're actually
the one who's running away

269
00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:38.523
from everything and everyone
you love in a week.

270
00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.090
What? I'm not running away.

271
00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:41.657
Pretty casual life event.

272
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.180
I know. right?

273
00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:45.052
How's that feeling?

274
00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:46.880
Exciting?

275
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:48.969
You know. it works better
if you don't make it sound
like a question.

276
00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:50.579
Ooh. yeah. yeah. I know.

277
00:11:50.622 --> 00:11:54.670
I mean. it's exciting. It is.
It's gonna be... refreshing.

278
00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:58.805
Where are you going again?
And for what?

279
00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:02.504
I'm starting out by helping
a small organic farm in Spain...

280
00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:04.680
Are you a hippie?

281
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.856
You say that like someone
just stabbed you.

282
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.076
If you are. then someone
did just stab me.

283
00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:11.121
I'm not. I promise.

284
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:14.037
I mean. I promise?

285
00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:18.085
-It's a nice farm too.
-Okay.

286
00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:19.869
Yeah. anyways.

287
00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:23.786
So. yeah. I'm going to go there
and then I go to London

288
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.353
for my Master's.

289
00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:28.051
-For like a year.
-I'm so disappointed
with myself.

290
00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.705
I'm sorry. What was that?

291
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.099
I'm starting
a nudist commune in Berkeley.

292
00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:33.622
Fuckin' knew it.

293
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.886
Okay. so London.

294
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.714
Mm-hmm.

295
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.455
Why would it go for two?

296
00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:44.067
Mm-mm. I guess
I'm bad at school.

297
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.765
Are you bad at school?

298
00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:49.029
Mm-mm. more like
if I get bored with it.

299
00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:52.423
Why would you ever
get bored of school?

300
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:53.729
I know. right?

301
00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:56.688
No. more like if I lose
interest. I guess.

302
00:12:56.732 --> 00:12:58.908
Which would happen because...?

303
00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:01.258
'Cause I just like signed up
for this Master's

304
00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:02.956
because I have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

305
00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.044
Ah!

306
00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:08.309
I hadn't said that
out aloud yet.

307
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:10.572
It's really depressing.

308
00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:14.445
Well. if it makes you feel
any better. I. like you.

309
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:17.187
am also completely unsure
of what I'm doing
with my life too.

310
00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:20.582
-Nope.
-No?

311
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:21.975
-No.
-Okay.

312
00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:24.194
How about this?

313
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:27.632
I'm pretty sure
that a majority of our peers

314
00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:31.245
are also completely unsure
of the current paths
their lives are on

315
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:35.118
and the uncertainty is
slowly killing them unknowingly.

316
00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:37.729
All of us are just lost.

317
00:13:37.773 --> 00:13:39.644
even the ones who seem like
they know what they're doing.

318
00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:44.606
even the ones working
for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res

319
00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:50.830
saving lives just completely.
overwhelmingly lost.

320
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:52.570
flailing at nothing.

321
00:13:54.442 --> 00:13:58.794
Well. maybe not them
but everyone else's super lost.

322
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.143
Life is fun.

323
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:03.233
Yeah.

324
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:11.024
Why are you cool?

325
00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:14.636
Hmm? Oh. what?

326
00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.377
That's a weird question.

327
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.901
I mean like why are you cool
and why am I meeting you
right now

328
00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:20.860
before I'm about to leave
for a fucking long time?

329
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.906
Stop being cool.

330
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.603
-No promises.
-Stop it.

331
00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:31.261
And it's because the world
don't give no fucks
about timing or love or...

332
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:34.351
or cool people
being cool together...

333
00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:35.875
-Mm-hmm.
-You know what I mean.

334
00:14:39.008 --> 00:14:41.750
Yeah. it sucks.

335
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:42.969
Yeah.

336
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:51.499
Am I going to see you tomorrow?

337
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:52.543
Maybe.

338
00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:56.591
Yes.

339
00:14:57.592 --> 00:14:58.767
Yes?

340
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:03.946
Sweet.

341
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.559
Ladies and gentlemen.

342
00:15:51.602 --> 00:15:52.864
we're here...

343
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.130
-Are you drunk already?
-No.

344
00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:58.783
-Are you sure?
-Are you sure?

345
00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:01.743
Yeah. but I forgot what I was
going to say. So. to you guys!

346
00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:03.788
-Yeah!
-To us!

347
00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:06.008
-Yeah! Sure!
-Cool.

348
00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:08.141
I mean.
are you going to say it?

349
00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:12.449
I don't know about you guys.

350
00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:14.234
but I think I'm really drunk.

351
00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.454
-Me too actually.
-You look very composed.

352
00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:19.108
-You?
-Yeah!

353
00:16:19.152 --> 00:16:20.588
You couldn't tell?

354
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:22.503
I swear there was
two people at this table...

355
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.600
I forgot
how cold it is here.

356
00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:18.646
It's also like his house.

357
00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:20.909
It's so creepy.

358
00:17:20.952 --> 00:17:23.999
This whole place
is like made of noise.

359
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.131
Yeah.

360
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.485
Argh. ah!

361
00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:32.486
What are you doing?

362
00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:34.227
I'm laying down.

363
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:37.969
And you should know.
you look great from here.

364
00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:40.537
Mm-hmm.

365
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:44.106
And you also look great
from behind
and when you're above.

366
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.282
Overall anytime you're naked.

367
00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:48.893
Thank you.

368
00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:53.289
Can I have your number?

369
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.683
I just realized
I don't have your number

370
00:17:55.726 --> 00:17:58.251
and I also know
that you're leaving soon

371
00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:02.820
and it isn't exactly useful
and I'm saying
too many words but. yeah.

372
00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:04.692
Yes.

373
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:09.436
To the number part
or are you agreeing
with this being pretty futile.

374
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:11.133
-Both.
-Hmm.

375
00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:14.571
Your sense of humor
is kinda weird.

376
00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:16.573
Ugh. thanks.

377
00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.663
Most people say it tethers
between completely unfunny
and morbidly depressing

378
00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:22.013
so. I'll take weird.

379
00:18:22.057 --> 00:18:23.624
Mmm.

380
00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:26.017
So. are we going to talk
about how much
we miss each other

381
00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:27.715
when we never
see each other again?

382
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:29.064
Obviously.

383
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.153
That is the perfect
relationship.

384
00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:34.156
We get to have
all the emotional baggage

385
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.723
and none of the fun.

386
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:37.290
By which I mean sex.

387
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.728
-Mm-hmm.
-All sadness. no sex.

388
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:44.079
Yeah. it's like when I cry
myself to sleep at night
when I miss you.

389
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.342
it's like nobody
will be there to hold me.

390
00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:48.170
Way to ratchet things up. Laura.

391
00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:50.433
-Damn.
-I'm kidding. It's a joke.

392
00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:51.956
I know.

393
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.960
Honestly. this is a bummer.

394
00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:57.223
Yeah.

395
00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:01.096
You're gone in a week?

396
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.359
Uh-huh.

397
00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:07.624
That's unfortunate.

398
00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:12.499
You're just going home?
Where are you from again?

399
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:15.980
Yeah. I'm just going to go drop
my car off back in Berkeley.

400
00:19:16.024 --> 00:19:18.722
-Ah!
-Hang out there for a week.

401
00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:21.160
I was going to see my parents.
but they went to Hawaii.

402
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.031
-Well. that's pretty cold.
-Nah. it's fine.

403
00:19:23.074 --> 00:19:25.207
I see them like all the time.
I saw them
two weeks ago actually.

404
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:27.818
Ah. well. in that case.
fuck. yeah. Hawaii.

405
00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:29.168
Yeah.

406
00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:48.012
You should just come down to LA.

407
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:49.318
I know. right?

408
00:19:52.887 --> 00:19:54.105
Fuck it. do it.

409
00:19:55.803 --> 00:19:59.937
I'm serious. Fuck it.
just start your vacation early.

410
00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:02.592
Are you serious?

411
00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:04.028
I just said I'm serious.

412
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.554
But like are you serious.
serious or you're like...

413
00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:08.946
If you're about it.

414
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.949
I can take the week off

415
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:14.735
or well. I can probably
start my weekend early.

416
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:16.824
You're serious.

417
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.565
Fuck. yeah. I am.

418
00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:20.915
You just invited me
to your house in LA.

419
00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.004
-Do it!

420
00:20:23.047 --> 00:20:24.484
Why are you still sitting?

421
00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:26.268
Come on down.
the weather's fine.

422
00:20:26.312 --> 00:20:29.880
Are you talking
about the bed or LA or...

423
00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:32.622
Well. neither. I don't know.
Just trying to get you
to lay down.

424
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.711
I hope I don't hate you.

425
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.148
Oh. well. I'm pretty hateable

426
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:41.631
so that's almost definitely
going to be very bad.

427
00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:43.198
Damn!

428
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.374
I guess for me
it's like kinda bummer
to realize

429
00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:48.290
that what I wanted to do
may not actually be
what I want to do.

430
00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:50.640
Yeah. hence
the life-changing move.

431
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.076
Yeah. I know.

432
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.948
It's like the most entitled
thing ever to be like.

433
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:56.820
I feel like I'm wasting my life
so I'm going to go to Europe.

434
00:20:56.864 --> 00:20:58.300
At least you're doing
something productive.

435
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.570
Sun set.

436
00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:08.832
It's pretty.

437
00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:18.320
Try packing for an entire year.
Like it would be any smaller.

438
00:21:18.364 --> 00:21:21.105
Okay. how you doing there?

439
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:23.238
-I have a technique
with my knee.
-Ah-ha!

440
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:29.331
Laura. has of course refused
all help with that thing.

441
00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:31.855
How about the stairs?
Want some help now?

442
00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:39.341
Welcome to my apartment
which is decorated by a boy.

443
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:41.082
It's nice. It's clean.

444
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.953
Thanks. I like to think so.

445
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:49.351
So. you want to unpack now
or just grab food or drinks

446
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:52.963
or just fucking go nuts
and black out and wake up
in Mexico. What's up?

447
00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:55.662
Um. food in Mexico
after blacking out?

448
00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.142
Yes. I like
where your head's at.

449
00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:01.581
Yeah. so my 12-year-old self
is sitting there bawling
my eyes out.

450
00:22:01.624 --> 00:22:03.844
crying about how Beanie Babies
are going out of business

451
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:06.368
and they'll be gone forever
and everyone's going
to forget about them

452
00:22:06.412 --> 00:22:08.370
which means one day
I'll be gone forever

453
00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:10.764
and everyone is going
to forget about me.

454
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:12.374
Wow!

455
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:15.116
Yeah. and my parents
who by now are
completely un-amused

456
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:17.031
are looking at me like. "Why?"

457
00:22:17.074 --> 00:22:18.162
Mm-hmm.

458
00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:19.686
I took a good second
to catch my breath

459
00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:22.079
and they go. and I wish
I could do the accent better.

460
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.607
"Okay. well.
your food is getting cold."

461
00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:30.871
That's awesome!

462
00:22:30.914 --> 00:22:32.525
-Yeah.
-Or sad.

463
00:22:32.568 --> 00:22:35.441
Well. I think...
I think they were right
though. you know.

464
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:39.488
Excellent handling
of prepubescent existential
crisis I think.

465
00:22:39.532 --> 00:22:42.099
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:22:42.143 --> 00:22:44.580
Yeah. so that was
my very graceful first encounter

467
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:47.627
with the recognition
of death as an inevitability.

468
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:52.501
Your turn for formative
childhood memory.

469
00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:54.634
Hmm. yours was cute and funny.

470
00:22:54.677 --> 00:22:57.767
No. No. no. no.
It's going to be great.

471
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:00.335
Unless you like murder
someone in it or something.

472
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:01.380
How'd you know?

473
00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:03.773
Okay.

474
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:07.342
I remember hiding
under the covers with my brother

475
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:10.040
because our parents were
fighting outside of our room

476
00:23:10.084 --> 00:23:11.999
which happened a lot.

477
00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:14.175
Um. and this time.

478
00:23:14.218 --> 00:23:18.266
I kinda like just decided

479
00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:21.051
that I was not ever
going to end up

480
00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:26.709
like living in a house
having arguments
with someone I hated.

481
00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:28.624
Hmm.

482
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:29.973
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

483
00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:35.022
It was like my first sense
of agency. you know.

484
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:36.893
which is kinda
depressing to have

485
00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:39.418
and all that when you
realize you can try out
your own path to be

486
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:42.508
in response to never wanting
to become your parents.

487
00:23:44.205 --> 00:23:45.728
Yeah.

488
00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:47.991
I told you
that was dark.

489
00:23:48.035 --> 00:23:50.472
I'm not very good at this whole
casual conversation thing.

490
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:54.128
Yeah. We're good
at being bad at stuff.

491
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.957
-Which. you know. fun.
-Yeah.

492
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.828
We're good at being...
does that make sense?

493
00:23:58.872 --> 00:24:00.743
-Absolutely.
-We're good
at being bad at stuff.

494
00:24:00.787 --> 00:24:03.703
-Yeah. I'll take it.
-Good.

495
00:24:20.154 --> 00:24:22.809
I know doing
something good
is better than nothing.

496
00:24:22.852 --> 00:24:25.159
but like. I don't know.

497
00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:28.945
I was starting to feel like
I was just going to be
like spending my entire life.

498
00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:36.605
like. like I don't know.
walking across the world.

499
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:39.347
Sort of like just
slowly going nowhere...

500
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.001
-On foot.
-Yeah. exactly.

501
00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:43.090
-I get it.
-Yeah. anyways. I don't know.

502
00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:48.922
It was really frustrating
so I quit and. yeah.

503
00:24:49.792 --> 00:24:53.404
I guess I feel like
going back to school
will open up more doors

504
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:55.537
so I'll probably be able
to do more. you know.

505
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.886
Yeah.

506
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.801
But I don't want to be
a politician though so.

507
00:24:58.845 --> 00:25:00.324
I'd hope not.

508
00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:04.981
What about you?

509
00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:07.462
What's this job you're supposed
to be at in like...

510
00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:11.553
-...five hours?

511
00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:12.859
Uh. it's like...

512
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.210
Okay. so the people are awesome

513
00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:18.908
and I was pretty blessed
to fall into it.

514
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.607
-And?

515
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.086
I fucking hate it.

516
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.915
I was asking what it was.
but that's good to know too.

517
00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:28.744
Oh. right. yes.
the original question.

518
00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:34.228
Um. I work
at a small boutique ad agency

519
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:35.882
as a project manager.

520
00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:37.797
Basically I pamper clients.

521
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.104
I'm like essentially an ad man.

522
00:25:41.148 --> 00:25:44.064
I'm part of the team
that had a huge hand

523
00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:48.242
in sending pop culture
down the super productive path
it's currently on.

524
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:50.723
It's like I'm literally
one of the bad guys.

525
00:25:51.637 --> 00:25:55.249
The world runs because
good people do bad things.

526
00:25:55.292 --> 00:25:57.686
Yeah. I agree.

527
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.036
I mean it's not nice
but I feel like it's true.

528
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.298
I felt that way.

529
00:26:03.257 --> 00:26:06.086
Except. you do good stuff

530
00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:09.829
like preserving our environment
for future generations

531
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:12.658
and you've spent
all of your early 20's

532
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.703
working towards that exact goal.

533
00:26:14.747 --> 00:26:17.706
Yeah. but on a personal level
it's exactly the same thing.
you know.

534
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.490
it's like that joke
you made the other day.

535
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:22.406
What joke I...

536
00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:24.800
Like the one about...

537
00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:26.933
I kinda say... I kinda
say a lot of stuff. right?

538
00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:28.499
-The one about...
-I just say shit.

539
00:26:28.543 --> 00:26:30.763
...depressed doctors
at MSF. you know.

540
00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:32.765
You said it like it may
or may not be true so.

541
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:34.897
I don't know. but whatever
the point is it's like

542
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:37.421
you're "flailing at nothing"
was the phrase.

543
00:26:37.465 --> 00:26:41.991
Ah. yes that.
That definitely sounds like me.

544
00:26:44.211 --> 00:26:46.126
Yeah. I remember that.

545
00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.873
So. you know how as Americans
we hate being told what to do?

546
00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:55.744
Fuck. yeah!

547
00:26:55.788 --> 00:26:57.659
We love freedom
more than life itself.

548
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.487
Right. and like even if we
were going to do it anyway

549
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.097
is we don't want
to be told to do it.

550
00:27:02.098 --> 00:27:03.534
Probably.

551
00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:05.624
So. like as a result we have
a lot of personal freedom.

552
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:08.235
Well. hold on.
Some more than others.

553
00:27:08.278 --> 00:27:10.106
Okay. so there's always
more work to be done.

554
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.847
but like generally speaking.

555
00:27:11.891 --> 00:27:14.763
we have more personal freedom
now than we used to. you know?

556
00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:16.373
-Yeah.
-Like in my case.

557
00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:20.073
I didn't like
what I was doing so I quit

558
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:23.032
and now I'm literally
flying across the world
because I've decided to.

559
00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:25.252
Yeah.

560
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:28.864
And it's like. we haven't really
thought about what to do
with all that freedom. you know.

561
00:27:28.908 --> 00:27:32.563
We're like. maybe
we have but like not really.

562
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:57.632
You look like someone
killed your cat.

563
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.329
Dana just put her two weeks in.

564
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.505
So that meeting went well.

565
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:03.725
-Damn!
-Yeah.

566
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:06.206
Jim really knows
how to understaff a place.

567
00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:07.642
It's that "start-up" vibe.

568
00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:10.689
Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:12.734
Well. at least
there's beer in the fridge.

570
00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:15.694
Nobody ever drinks it.
but at least it's there.

571
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.531
Hey there.
can I get you anymore tea?

572
00:28:27.575 --> 00:28:28.707
Uh. sure.

573
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.752
Okay. give me
one more minute. ma'am.

574
00:28:30.796 --> 00:28:32.014
Thank you.

575
00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:39.108
So. how's LA honey?

576
00:28:39.152 --> 00:28:42.764
It's nice or maybe it's just
like better than I imagined.

577
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:45.593
I don't know why
I always thought I hated LA.

578
00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:48.770
Oh. probably because you got sick when we went to Disneyland

579
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:50.685
and cried in all of the lines

580
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.774
so we never went back
to Los Angeles again.

581
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:54.602
Well. no I didn't.

582
00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:56.952
Yeah. yeah. you did.
You don't remember?

583
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:59.955
Your brother thought
it was his fault
and felt bad the whole time.

584
00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:01.827
which was kinda adorable.

585
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.220
-I know.
-Um. I did that?

586
00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:06.483
You did that. Yes. Oops.

587
00:29:06.527 --> 00:29:07.789
Sorry.

588
00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:09.704
You should have seen your dad.

589
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.140
Ugh. I can imagine.

590
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:13.664
Anyway. I've been looking
at apartments in London.

591
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:15.188
-Uh-huh.
-And...

592
00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:18.887
My first takeaway
is that they're very expensive.

593
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:20.889
You're having second thoughts?

594
00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:27.896
No. it's just like eye-opening
and like... expensive.

595
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.030
I told you. honey. it was
going to be quite a change.

596
00:29:32.727 --> 00:29:35.512
Yeah. I know.
I didn't plan it very well.

597
00:29:35.556 --> 00:29:37.776
No. it's not that.
I mean. that's all fine.

598
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:40.430
Well. for me at least.
I'm not the one
figuring out my life.

599
00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.171
Well. thanks. Mom.

600
00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:43.651
I'm sorry.

601
00:29:43.694 --> 00:29:46.088
Do you think
I'm doing the right thing?

602
00:29:46.132 --> 00:29:47.481
Is this like a good decision?

603
00:29:47.524 --> 00:29:49.744
Laura. honey.
I honestly can't say.

604
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.878
I mean. I think what you're doing is pretty drastic.

605
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:54.705
but I also can't blame you.

606
00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:57.447
If I was in your shoes.

607
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:59.580
I might have done
what you're doing.

608
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.322
I love your father very much

609
00:30:02.365 --> 00:30:04.672
and I'm happy
with where I'm at in life

610
00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:06.805
and how I did things.

611
00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:08.850
I mean. it wasn't easy
and there were things
I had to give up on the way.

612
00:30:08.894 --> 00:30:10.852
but like I've said before.

613
00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:15.074
you live
in an absolutely new age.

614
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:17.076
I can't imagine things now.

615
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:22.037
I mean. I don't know what
it is like for you nowadays.

616
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:25.736
I mean. for me. I got my degree. started a family

617
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.392
and I've been at my job
working it for 20 years.

618
00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:31.090
It's okay.

619
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:33.353
The people are good
and we're not destroying
the earth.

620
00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:35.746
but for me that's all I need.

621
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.837
But it's different now
for people your age.

622
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.709
I mean. endless possibilities
have been presented.

623
00:30:41.752 --> 00:30:43.580
Whether or not that's better.

624
00:30:45.713 --> 00:30:49.325
well. that is the part where I think you have to figure things out on your own.

625
00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:50.370
Yeah. but like...

626
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.895
-Okay...
-Basically honey. look.

627
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:57.290
I don't have any way
to know whether or not
you're doing the right thing.

628
00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:01.468
but you're young
and you'll probably live
twice as long as we will.

629
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:04.427
so. why not. you know?

630
00:31:05.515 --> 00:31:07.082
Okay. thank you.

631
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:11.695
You also need to come to Hawaii.

632
00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:13.610
It's beautiful.

633
00:31:13.654 --> 00:31:16.178
Me and your dad
jumped off some rocks
into the ocean yesterday

634
00:31:16.222 --> 00:31:17.788
-and wow!
-You what?

635
00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:21.923
We jumped
off some rocks into the ocean.

636
00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:23.794
It was amazing.

637
00:31:23.838 --> 00:31:25.231
That's nice.

638
00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:28.103
Oh. honey.
you're home so soon.

639
00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:30.018
How was work?
Would you like a meatloaf?

640
00:31:30.062 --> 00:31:33.282
Uh. I'm not going to lie.
that was pretty frightening.

641
00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:36.459
That's me.
your worst domestic nightmare.

642
00:31:36.503 --> 00:31:37.765
Oh. God!

643
00:31:37.808 --> 00:31:39.680
No. really. how was work?

644
00:31:39.723 --> 00:31:44.728
I just stared at the computer
and had a sandwich at some point

645
00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:47.949
and had some coffee.

646
00:31:47.993 --> 00:31:50.909
stared at the computer
some more.

647
00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:52.911
had some more coffee.

648
00:31:52.954 --> 00:31:54.390
Oh. yeah. Neha says. "Hey."

649
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:56.305
How much do you get paid
to do that. again?

650
00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:57.698
I don't know.

651
00:31:57.741 --> 00:32:00.005
I stopped counting
because it was so much.

652
00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:04.183
Oh. also I decided
to just take the week off.

653
00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:05.140
What?

654
00:32:05.184 --> 00:32:07.795
Yeah. 'cause things are slow

655
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:11.451
and I've been hauling ass
for months and I'm about to
again in a couple of weeks

656
00:32:11.494 --> 00:32:14.628
and you're here
and fuck it. you know.

657
00:32:14.671 --> 00:32:16.630
You can just do that?

658
00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:20.939
We have one of those
"we trust our employee"
paid time off policies.

659
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:23.680
I think I'm blushing.

660
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:24.681
It'll be fun.

661
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:26.988
What should we do to celebrate?

662
00:32:27.032 --> 00:32:32.298
Uh. I haven't thought that far.

663
00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:35.692
You know it works better
when you don't say it
like a question.

664
00:32:35.736 --> 00:32:39.479
What I mean is I get terribly lonely sometimes.

665
00:32:41.176 --> 00:32:42.525
Me too.

666
00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:46.225
You like your wine
to taste like wine.

667
00:32:46.268 --> 00:32:47.791
You're gonna taste it
or something?

668
00:32:47.835 --> 00:32:50.011
Tried really hard
not to. I promise.

669
00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:52.796
Hmm. what are we
going to do with you?

670
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.624
We are in a wine store.

671
00:32:55.582 --> 00:32:58.759
Is that you trying to tell me
to drink myself into ruin?

672
00:32:58.802 --> 00:33:00.108
Are you trying to ruin me?

673
00:33:00.152 --> 00:33:01.892
Duh!

674
00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:05.548
Oh. good 'cause
it's been a while
since I've had a good ruining.

675
00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:08.725
Oh. yeah? It's like a side hobby
of yours. an annual ruining?

676
00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.076
Yeah. it's the best.
You should try it.

677
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:13.469
Well. I'm a connoisseur of ruin.

678
00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:15.471
You're fucking nuts.

679
00:33:15.515 --> 00:33:16.559
Aren't we all?

680
00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:21.521
-Drink?
-Yeah.

681
00:33:21.564 --> 00:33:22.870
What are you making?

682
00:33:22.913 --> 00:33:27.048
Um. Gatorade and soda water.

683
00:33:27.092 --> 00:33:32.053
so it's a Gatorade
and gin or soda water.

684
00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:33.794
Which one was the first one?

685
00:33:33.837 --> 00:33:36.057
"Stay free. stay true."

686
00:33:37.537 --> 00:33:39.626
Yeah. I think
it's pretty self-explanatory.

687
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:42.542
-Hmm. No.
-No?

688
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:45.501
All right.
my 18-year-old self is like.

689
00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:49.070
"You're going to fucking
sell out one of these days.
you motherfucker.

690
00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:53.248
So this is to remind you
that you used to have morals."

691
00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:55.729
Hmm. I love that.

692
00:33:55.772 --> 00:33:56.904
Yeah. that's awesome.

693
00:33:58.514 --> 00:34:01.039
I kinda think that's the point
of tattoos really. you know.

694
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:04.781
Mini time capsules of whatever
was important at the time.

695
00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.001
Only in this case.
it was important then

696
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:10.613
and now just well.
quietly ignored every day.

697
00:34:10.657 --> 00:34:14.095
Hmm. and this one?

698
00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.097
-Uh. yeah.
-Cut ups?

699
00:34:16.141 --> 00:34:19.318
Uh. yeah. also 18.
me and my group of friends

700
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:22.321
were going to college
or whatever the fuck
we were doing.

701
00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:24.627
There were five of us.

702
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:26.847
We. uh... it's dumb.

703
00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:30.764
So. because
we were cool as shit.

704
00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:36.335
uh. we called ourselves
"Cut ups".

705
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:42.080
sort of like joke
bastardization of fuck ups.

706
00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:43.733
-Right.
-I don't know.

707
00:34:43.777 --> 00:34:45.605
It's clever.

708
00:34:45.648 --> 00:34:50.436
We were all about to leave.
so we got matching tattoos.

709
00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:52.133
Yeah. Frank has one.

710
00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:53.787
-Oh.
-Yeah.

711
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.094
Long story short. we're idiots.

712
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:58.879
It's my favorite one.

713
00:34:58.922 --> 00:35:00.272
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

714
00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:02.230
-A heart skewered
on a big ass knife?
-Mm-hmm.

715
00:35:04.058 --> 00:35:04.928
All right.

716
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.496
How about yours?

717
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.063
Does that say. "Carry on!"?

718
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:10.543
Mm-hmm. I know.

719
00:35:10.586 --> 00:35:13.111
-It's pretty bad.
-I don't know. it's kinda cool.

720
00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:18.159
I see we have this
two-word phrase thing going.

721
00:35:18.203 --> 00:35:20.727
Hmm. I knew I liked you
for a reason.

722
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.338
-Story.
-Mm-mm. no.

723
00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:27.951
-No?
-No. it's embarrassing.

724
00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:29.692
Come on.
I still want to hear it.

725
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:34.132
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

726
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:36.656
-You know it. Come on.
-How sure?

727
00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:38.136
Very sure.

728
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:40.747
Like you would get married
with me sure?

729
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.271
-That's uh...
-Or like you would bet
your life on it. sure?

730
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:44.403
-...a really weird thing.
-I know.

731
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:46.013
That one didn't really work.

732
00:35:46.056 --> 00:35:49.190
Story. Story.

733
00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:50.713
Okay. okay.

734
00:35:50.757 --> 00:35:51.801
Uhm...

735
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:57.285
So. I was very depressed
in college.

736
00:35:57.329 --> 00:36:00.201
My junior year.
or whenever you're 21.

737
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.594
-Is that junior year?
-Yeah. junior year.

738
00:36:01.637 --> 00:36:04.640
Anyways. um. yeah. I...

739
00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:09.689
I was finished taking my finals
and my roommates
were also taking their finals

740
00:36:09.732 --> 00:36:12.735
and I just kind of...

741
00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:16.652
I don't know.
I had a lot of time
and like kind of just...

742
00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:20.221
I don't know.
I was pretty unhappy
with things at home.

743
00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:22.484
with how things were at school.
people I was hanging out with.

744
00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:24.051
my roommates included.

745
00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:26.488
and so I just kinda went off
by myself and got a tattoo.

746
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:27.924
Hmm.

747
00:36:27.968 --> 00:36:29.535
I guess as some sort of...

748
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.408
I don't know. It felt good.

749
00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:38.152
Good enough for me I'd say.

750
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.153
Yeah.

751
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:50.730
Some friends
are having a little party
at their house today.

752
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:54.212
On a Wednesday?

753
00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:58.216
Yeah. apparently some people
follow their dreams or whatever.

754
00:36:58.259 --> 00:36:59.695
Yeah. they're having
a little thing.

755
00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:01.610
It's usually pretty chill.

756
00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:03.395
Sounds like my kind of party.

757
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:06.354
How are you?
Are you close with your parents?

758
00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:07.747
Are they from here?

759
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.664
Yeah. they were immigrants
and um. yeah. I'd say so.

760
00:37:11.707 --> 00:37:13.666
Yeah. pretty good.

761
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:17.887
It's just sort of impossible
to thank them enough.
ever though. you know.

762
00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:21.021
Because?

763
00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:26.287
I mean. basically it's so hard
for me to even imagine

764
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:29.421
giving up everything you know
and have grown up with

765
00:37:29.464 --> 00:37:33.294
solely in order to give
your kids who haven't
even been conceived yet

766
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:34.513
a better shot at things.

767
00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:37.820
all by like the age of 25.

768
00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:43.435
So. it's not even a question
about them caring.

769
00:37:43.478 --> 00:37:46.002
I just feel like
kind of a little shit

770
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:52.139
every time the thought.
"Why am I at a job I hate?"

771
00:37:52.182 --> 00:37:55.185
Or "This is a monumental
waste of my time.

772
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:56.665
I'm wasting my life away.
Oh. my God!

773
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.537
I'm wasting my life away"
creeps in. you know?

774
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.843
Yeah. well. I mean it's like
a very valid feeling for you

775
00:38:00.887 --> 00:38:02.671
because advertising is useless.

776
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:09.461
-Yes. yes. yes.
-I'm kidding.

777
00:38:09.504 --> 00:38:12.681
I also kinda feel like
your parents wouldn't
really mind if you mixed it up.

778
00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:16.685
Yeah. You're probably right.

779
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:19.209
What did you think of me
when you first met me?

780
00:38:19.253 --> 00:38:23.083
Uh. first time
or just last weekend?

781
00:38:23.126 --> 00:38:25.955
First time. because
I'm assuming you were
in love by last weekend.

782
00:38:25.999 --> 00:38:28.393
I've been yours
since I was born. Laura.

783
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:31.874
Uh... First time.

784
00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:34.877
-Honest?
-No. lie to my face.

785
00:38:34.921 --> 00:38:36.531
That's a pretty weird request.

786
00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:38.925
-Come on.
-Okay. all right.

787
00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:42.276
You came out of I think
Neha's room

788
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.540
and you sat down with us
and started talking bad shit.

789
00:38:45.584 --> 00:38:48.848
Spitting vitriol
and I was done for.

790
00:38:49.762 --> 00:38:51.154
Also you're hot

791
00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:53.200
and you were wearing
these high-waisted leather pants

792
00:38:53.243 --> 00:38:55.071
and I was just dead.

793
00:38:55.115 --> 00:38:57.813
And then the guy you were with
popped out and
I was like. "I'm out."

794
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.772
And promptly forgot about you.

795
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:03.166
Okay. so you went
from like being in love
to over it in like five seconds.

796
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.472
Probably more like one or two.

797
00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:07.301
-Oh! Men!
-We're fun.

798
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:11.000
-You're not curious?
-I didn't say that.

799
00:39:12.088 --> 00:39:13.568
What'd you think?

800
00:39:13.612 --> 00:39:16.571
And before anything.
I'd like to request a pass

801
00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:17.920
because I was smashed.

802
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:19.792
Sure.
you don't need one. but fine.

803
00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:23.622
Okay. so I was on the side room
with that guy I was seeing.

804
00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:25.450
He was basically
pouring his heart out to me

805
00:39:25.493 --> 00:39:26.799
because we weren't
serious enough.

806
00:39:26.842 --> 00:39:29.410
And every time he would pause.

807
00:39:29.454 --> 00:39:33.371
there would be this huge laugh
coming from the next room.

808
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:35.373
It was you.

809
00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:37.984
And like the timing of it.
kinda made it seem like
you were laughing at him.

810
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:39.768
That is so brutal.

811
00:39:39.812 --> 00:39:44.904
Yeah. it was like your laugh
was making me feel weirdly good

812
00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:47.559
in a moment when
I should not ever feel good.

813
00:39:48.777 --> 00:39:52.085
And then I walked out
and I was just like. "Oh. fuck!"

814
00:39:52.128 --> 00:39:54.522
Good oh. fuck? Bad oh. fuck?

815
00:39:54.566 --> 00:39:56.481
You've seen me naked.

816
00:39:56.524 --> 00:39:57.482
Sweet.

817
00:40:40.002 --> 00:40:41.656
Good morning.

818
00:40:42.657 --> 00:40:44.267
Look at this.

819
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:45.834
It's a Michael

820
00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:49.011
in his natural habitat.
hungover and asleep

821
00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:51.057
deep into the morning.

822
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.493
No. no. no.

823
00:40:52.537 --> 00:40:55.235
Oh. notice how he tries
to cover his eyes

824
00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:57.455
with a pillow to shield them
from the morning light.

825
00:40:57.498 --> 00:40:58.934
Too early for this act.

826
00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:02.721
Now. we're in for a real treat.

827
00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:04.070
We're just going to...

828
00:41:05.114 --> 00:41:06.855
Hi. my name's Laura

829
00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:11.077
and I've sailed 13 oceans
and traveled 18 continents

830
00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.993
waking up hungover people
all over the world.

831
00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:16.604
Ah-ha and here we see
the wild Michael using sarcasm

832
00:41:16.648 --> 00:41:18.388
in an attempt to ward me off

833
00:41:18.432 --> 00:41:21.696
which is quite a shame because
he is really very pretty.

834
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:26.309
You know. my head will probably
explode if you had an accent.

835
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:27.180
I know.

836
00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:31.489
We'll put him back
under his rock.

837
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.883
What do you want to do today?

838
00:41:36.058 --> 00:41:41.020
I'm still kinda tired
and hungover.

839
00:41:41.063 --> 00:41:42.543
You and I both.

840
00:41:45.328 --> 00:41:49.507
Is this what it feels like
to get old and die together
with someone?

841
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.683
Hmm. yeah. I think so.

842
00:41:56.426 --> 00:41:57.515
Maybe a movie?

843
00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:01.954
Yeah. that could be nice.

844
00:42:01.997 --> 00:42:02.955
Cool.

845
00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:09.352
We should probably put pants on.

846
00:42:14.314 --> 00:42:15.533
Perhaps. yeah.

847
00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:19.406
-What shall we see?
-That looks good. no?

848
00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:21.626
Comedy. yeah.
I'll fuck with that.

849
00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:23.366
I'm sorry?

850
00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.325
I said. I'll fuck with that.

851
00:42:25.368 --> 00:42:28.763
-You'll fuck with that?
-Yeah. it's an expression.

852
00:42:31.026 --> 00:42:34.029
Yeah. he kinda brought it
up a couple months ago
while we were talking

853
00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:35.770
and it's just been
nagging at me since.

854
00:42:35.814 --> 00:42:37.293
About how you guys met so young?

855
00:42:37.337 --> 00:42:39.992
Yeah. and I think
it passed for him.

856
00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:42.255
but it's just been
bothering me since.

857
00:42:42.298 --> 00:42:43.996
Okay. I met this girl

858
00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:46.259
and she's married
her boyfriend of several years

859
00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:50.568
and she was telling me
how she felt like it was
vibrant all the time.

860
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:53.614
Well. yeah. it's because people
are always trying to seem
happier than they actually are

861
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:55.311
and besides
that's not for everyone.

862
00:42:55.355 --> 00:42:56.399
I know.

863
00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:58.619
but it's just weird
harsh reality

864
00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:01.056
that I have been on and off
with John since high school

865
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.974
and all that time
it's never been nearly
as intense as she describes.

866
00:43:06.018 --> 00:43:07.759
And he is great and I love him.

867
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:12.241
but I just couldn't shake
this question of.
"Are we doing this wrong?"

868
00:43:13.155 --> 00:43:17.246
And it's shitty because
he's genuinely a good person.

869
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:20.249
And how many good people
do you come across
in your lifetime. you know?

870
00:43:21.337 --> 00:43:23.688
Well. at least you've been
thinking through it
very thoroughly.

871
00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:27.256
Yeah. uh. maybe too much.
I don't know.

872
00:43:28.214 --> 00:43:29.476
Like look at you two.

873
00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:32.218
it's just so apparently intense.

874
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:34.437
Uh. no. I think
it's pretty different.

875
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:36.744
-We sort of just make
shit up as we go.
-Yeah.

876
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:38.224
I don't think you should
compare yourself to us.

877
00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.052
Besides I'm crazy. remember?

878
00:43:40.095 --> 00:43:42.663
-Yeah. that's just college.
-I don't know.

879
00:43:42.707 --> 00:43:45.579
All honesty. Neha.
because we've been friends

880
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:47.973
for longer
than either of us would like.

881
00:43:48.016 --> 00:43:50.497
I think. if something's nagging
at you endlessly.

882
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.107
you got to quash it. you know.

883
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:56.242
Whether by getting over it
or doing something about it.

884
00:43:56.285 --> 00:43:58.679
you got to stitch the cut.
you know what I mean?

885
00:43:58.723 --> 00:44:00.986
Yeah. I think so. Yeah.

886
00:44:02.422 --> 00:44:05.207
Well. sorry
for this bummer story guys.

887
00:44:05.251 --> 00:44:07.514
- Oh. my God! No. no.
- No need to worry.

888
00:44:07.557 --> 00:44:10.517
Okay. please.
change the topic.
Tell me about your week.

889
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.650
Um. our week
has been great.

890
00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:14.564
Lots of cheap food and drink.

891
00:44:14.608 --> 00:44:16.697
Ah. what she's saying
is she's been drunk
the whole time.

892
00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:19.700
Um. not the whole time
just part of the time.

893
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:22.747
Yeah. I mean. it's just like
the weather's so nice. alright.

894
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.313
so you have to drink
in the afternoons.

895
00:44:24.357 --> 00:44:25.793
-Yeah. obviously.
-And then in the evening
with dinner.

896
00:44:25.837 --> 00:44:27.926
-Yes.
-And then
she's totally wasted.

897
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:29.188
I mean...

898
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:31.277
I think it's just a buzz. right?

899
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.280
I mean you can't
blame her for that.

900
00:44:34.323 --> 00:44:35.368
Thank you.

901
00:44:35.411 --> 00:44:36.717
Got you. girl.

902
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:06.459
Oh. God. that is so hot!

903
00:46:06.502 --> 00:46:08.156
Yeah.
but it's the best though. right?

904
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.811
Oh. uh. mm-hmm. Oh. Jesus!

905
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:12.508
You two heading out?

906
00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:14.380
Yeah. we are actually because
we're going to Runyon tomorrow.

907
00:46:14.423 --> 00:46:15.468
Oh. that sucks.

908
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:18.253
No. it's like
a really nice hike.

909
00:46:18.297 --> 00:46:20.647
Yeah. yeah.
I'll take your word for it.

910
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:22.344
It is. Hey. Seb.
you riding with?

911
00:46:22.388 --> 00:46:24.172
- Yeah. I'm fucking tired.
-Okay. cool.

912
00:46:24.216 --> 00:46:25.739
Well. I will see you guys soon

913
00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:27.480
and I better see you
before you leave.

914
00:46:27.523 --> 00:46:29.569
- Yes.
-Post-hike lunch?

915
00:46:29.612 --> 00:46:30.788
-Yes?
-Yes.

916
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:32.790
Yes. Okay. cool.
Well. I'll text you.

917
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:34.269
See you soon. Bye. cuties.

918
00:46:34.313 --> 00:46:36.010
Bye. Neha. Later on. Seb.

919
00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:38.230
- Later. dude.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

920
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.064
We should probably
get going too. right?

921
00:46:47.326 --> 00:46:50.895
I don't know. I thought
it might be a cool date thing

922
00:46:50.938 --> 00:46:53.898
to try and watch the taco truck
pack up and leave. you know.

923
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:56.291
Oh. yeah.

924
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.858
No. yeah. I got a car.

925
00:46:59.381 --> 00:47:01.340
Now I'm kinda set on watching
the truck pack up. so.

926
00:47:01.383 --> 00:47:02.645
Okay.

927
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.916
Should we talk about what
happens after this week?

928
00:47:13.308 --> 00:47:15.049
Yeah. probably.

929
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:17.878
What are your thoughts on it?

930
00:47:21.316 --> 00:47:24.842
Uh. honestly I don't know.
What do you think?

931
00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:27.888
Uh. kinda in the same boat.

932
00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:33.111
I guess we should
probably sort it out.

933
00:47:33.154 --> 00:47:34.286
Yes.

934
00:47:36.157 --> 00:47:39.465
I mean. you are going to be
several thousand miles
and an ocean away.

935
00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:40.858
Yeah.

936
00:47:47.952 --> 00:47:51.651
Fuck. would you wanna
like stay in touch?

937
00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:54.915
Yeah. I mean. if you do.

938
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:57.613
-Yeah.
-Then. fuck. yeah.

939
00:48:01.182 --> 00:48:05.012
I guess it would probably
be good to leave
any expectations at home.

940
00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:07.145
Definitely. yeah.

941
00:48:07.188 --> 00:48:10.496
I just thought it would be nice
to like stay in touch.

942
00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:11.540
I agree.

943
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:17.764
The car is here.

944
00:48:17.807 --> 00:48:18.896
Oh.

945
00:48:30.951 --> 00:48:33.345
This is going
to sound kinda weird. but...

946
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:36.826
Go on.

947
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.742
You have to admit
that if we did have kids.

948
00:48:39.786 --> 00:48:41.048
they would be pretty cute.

949
00:48:41.092 --> 00:48:42.963
You're fucking great.

950
00:48:43.007 --> 00:48:45.009
I mean. you know I'm right.
Look at us.

951
00:48:45.052 --> 00:48:47.837
-I'm not disagreeing.
-Don't you think...?

952
00:48:47.881 --> 00:48:50.666
Wouldn't he and I have
the most beautiful children?

953
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.146
Yeah. yeah. Definitely.

954
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:54.540
-Right?
-Fuck. yeah.

955
00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:56.324
I didn't disagree with you.

956
00:48:56.368 --> 00:48:58.196
-We would.
-We would.

957
00:49:03.766 --> 00:49:05.768
I can't believe
I leave tomorrow.

958
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:08.293
Yeah. it'll be all right though.

959
00:49:09.207 --> 00:49:11.165
I guess.

960
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:13.646
It's not like
we're dying or anything

961
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:16.127
which. you know. "Hooray!"

962
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.867
It could be worse.

963
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.826
Yeah. It always could be worse.

964
00:49:19.869 --> 00:49:23.830
Yeah. it brightens
my day every time I think of it.

965
00:49:25.527 --> 00:49:28.443
Like. no matter how bad it is.
at least you're not dead?

966
00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:31.490
Exactly. Not dead in a ditch.
it's a good day.

967
00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:34.145
Your standards for a good day
are worryingly low.

968
00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:37.017
When I'm dead.
my headstone's going to have.

969
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:40.847
"Could be worse" emblazoned
across it in giant block font.

970
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:46.984
Sort of like my final "Fuck you"
to the world. you know or...

971
00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:48.115
I don't know.

972
00:49:51.553 --> 00:49:53.251
I like you.

973
00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:55.731
Good. I like you.

974
00:50:00.475 --> 00:50:03.739
- Sorry. dude.
-Oh. no. dude.
do whatever back there. man.

975
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.548
Got everything?

976
00:51:57.897 --> 00:51:59.725
Yes. I thought I forgot
my passport for a sec.

977
00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:01.161
What time is it?

978
00:52:01.205 --> 00:52:03.772
Looking for excuses
to come back early already. huh?

979
00:52:03.816 --> 00:52:04.817
4:15.

980
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.514
Fuck. Yeah. maybe.

981
00:52:06.558 --> 00:52:08.690
So. you're saying yes?

982
00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:10.692
Ooh. 10%.

983
00:52:50.123 --> 00:52:51.168
Hey.

984
00:52:51.211 --> 00:52:52.473
Hey.

985
00:52:52.517 --> 00:52:53.822
Hey.

986
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.869
- Hey.
- Hey.

987
00:52:56.912 --> 00:52:59.828
- Hey.
- Hey.

988
00:53:01.439 --> 00:53:04.398
-Hey.
- Hey.

989
00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:09.098
So. at what point
in this conversation do
we start the conversation?

990
00:53:09.142 --> 00:53:10.535
Mm.

991
00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:13.668
How is day 685 million

992
00:53:13.712 --> 00:53:16.367
of your European
captivity going?

993
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.544
I'm a little bit worried
that Stockholm Syndrome
has fully set in.

994
00:53:19.587 --> 00:53:21.415
So you're
just like. fully in love

995
00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:25.289
with what must be
a very torturous existence
in England?

996
00:53:25.332 --> 00:53:27.421
It really is
just awful.

997
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:30.903
It's like my God. the British
with their dry humor
and well-dressed ways.

998
00:53:30.946 --> 00:53:33.122
Sounds just...
unbearable.

999
00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:36.474
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

1000
00:53:37.344 --> 00:53:39.651
School still going well?

1001
00:53:39.694 --> 00:53:42.958
Yeah.
it's pretty relaxed.

1002
00:53:43.002 --> 00:53:46.179
-I'm halfway through.
- Hey.
hooray for halfway.

1003
00:53:47.963 --> 00:53:50.662
Sorry it's been
so long since we talked.

1004
00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:54.448
I mean.
it's a two-way street on that.

1005
00:53:54.492 --> 00:53:56.668
If you're sorry. I'm sorry.

1006
00:53:56.711 --> 00:53:59.236
Yeah. That's true.

1007
00:54:01.673 --> 00:54:05.590
I hate this.
I fucking hate this.

1008
00:54:05.633 --> 00:54:07.069
Me too.

1009
00:54:07.113 --> 00:54:08.549
It's like every time
I think about you.

1010
00:54:08.593 --> 00:54:11.770
I like miss you
and then I feel sadder

1011
00:54:11.813 --> 00:54:14.468
and then it's just like. "Fuck!"

1012
00:54:15.687 --> 00:54:17.515
It's just...

1013
00:54:18.472 --> 00:54:19.821
Sorry.

1014
00:54:19.865 --> 00:54:22.128
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1015
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:24.173
Yeah. but that almost
makes it worse. right?

1016
00:54:24.217 --> 00:54:27.307
'Cause it's like there's
a fucking ocean between us

1017
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:29.091
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

1018
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:33.748
I mean. fine. like obviously
we can do anything.

1019
00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:37.012
But like it would be...
it's like it sounds absurd.

1020
00:54:37.056 --> 00:54:39.363
Like. "Oh. Michael.
Just come to London

1021
00:54:39.406 --> 00:54:41.147
and follow me while
I wander around aimlessly."

1022
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.324
Or like. "Hey. Laura.
Ditch that Master's
and come to LA

1023
00:54:44.368 --> 00:54:46.718
and we can play
in the sun together."

1024
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:51.288
I just wish you were here.

1025
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:52.811
Me too.

1026
00:54:52.854 --> 00:54:56.336
Well. actually I'm not choosy
about here or there.

1027
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.685
but you know what I mean.

1028
00:54:57.729 --> 00:55:03.038
Anyway. so I take it
things are going well?

1029
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:10.437
Yeah.
things are... yeah.

1030
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:14.528
What about for you?

1031
00:55:14.572 --> 00:55:17.226
Same old. same old.

1032
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.707
Frank visited the other day
though. so that's cool.

1033
00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:21.056
Hmm. that's nice.

1034
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.406
Yeah.
that was pretty great.

1035
00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:23.972
Frank threw stuff at a bartender

1036
00:55:24.016 --> 00:55:26.148
who then gave us
free drinks in return.

1037
00:55:26.192 --> 00:55:28.847
I don't think it's supposed to work like that.

1038
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:30.979
I mean.
she's our friend.
but. yeah. me neither.

1039
00:55:31.023 --> 00:55:32.677
She did threaten to kick us out.

1040
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.374
Frank has promised to return

1041
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:36.376
and force her to make good
on her threat.

1042
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.899
He's in love with her.
isn't he?

1043
00:55:37.943 --> 00:55:39.379
Yeah. right.

1044
00:55:42.904 --> 00:55:44.906
Sorry. I'm so like tired.

1045
00:55:46.517 --> 00:55:50.129
I don't know I just feel
like I've been very bummed
all the time lately.

1046
00:55:50.172 --> 00:55:51.130
Lately?

1047
00:55:52.174 --> 00:55:54.655
Right.

1048
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:58.572
Things get frustrating on this god-forsaken space rock.

1049
00:55:59.921 --> 00:56:03.011
We're all trapped here
by our own choices

1050
00:56:03.055 --> 00:56:05.362
which is like paradoxical or...

1051
00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:08.060
which. whatever.
you know what I mean.

1052
00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:10.932
Yeah. I know.
I do know what you mean.

1053
00:56:10.976 --> 00:56:12.064
It's like give them enough rope.

1054
00:56:12.107 --> 00:56:13.457
but in this case freedom
is the rope

1055
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.980
and we've given it to ourselves.

1056
00:56:15.023 --> 00:56:16.590
Yeah. the world's
on fire anyway.

1057
00:56:16.634 --> 00:56:20.028
It's fine. A small fire.
it's still a fire though.

1058
00:56:20.072 --> 00:56:21.943
Not dead in a ditch. right?

1059
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.684
Not just yet.

1060
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.519
I miss you.

1061
00:56:32.563 --> 00:56:35.392
Yeah. I miss you too.

1062
00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:42.137
Do you think
we'd be happy together?

1063
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:46.315
Yeah. I think
we'd be pretty good.

1064
00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:48.579
Yeah.

1065
00:56:51.538 --> 00:56:53.497
I worry you would
hate me though.

1066
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.152
Well. if anyone's hateable.
it's definitely you.

1067
00:56:57.196 --> 00:56:58.937
Oh. boo!

1068
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.634
Didn't see that one coming.
did you?

1069
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:03.245
I like you.

1070
00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:05.813
I don't think it's supposed
to work like that.

1071
00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:13.212
Tell me things
about your life.

1072
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.709
Oh. my fucking fuck. dude.

1073
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.148
Shut the fuck up
for a fucking minute.

1074
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.978
Fuck you dogs.

1075
00:57:43.068 --> 00:57:45.200
Hey. did you get
that raise at least?

1076
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:47.768
Yea. but not as much
as I had asked.

1077
00:57:47.812 --> 00:57:49.814
Oh.

1078
00:57:49.857 --> 00:57:52.512
The lady who was training me
decided to leave two weeks
earlier than expected.

1079
00:57:52.556 --> 00:57:56.037
so I'm pretty much...
she was just like get over it.
I guess.

1080
00:57:56.995 --> 00:58:00.738
So. now I'm just kinda like
fumbling around in the dark.

1081
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:01.913
Huh.

1082
00:58:01.956 --> 00:58:04.132
So everything is still.

1083
00:58:04.176 --> 00:58:07.179
"Holy shit. this is so much more
work than I ever expected
and everything is broken."

1084
00:58:08.354 --> 00:58:10.182
Pretty much. yeah.

1085
00:58:10.225 --> 00:58:11.400
So it goes.

1086
00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:14.491
Yeah. how is the battle
of Britain going?

1087
00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:17.450
You mean Laura?

1088
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:18.930
Yeah. how is that going?

1089
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:22.716
Uh. it's not.

1090
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.110
Bummer. Bad?

1091
00:58:25.153 --> 00:58:26.546
No.

1092
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:27.895
Out with a whimper.

1093
00:58:28.766 --> 00:58:30.463
So. who stopped talking to who?

1094
00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:31.377
Both.

1095
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.249
So. her?

1096
00:58:34.293 --> 00:58:37.296
Yeah. but...

1097
00:58:37.339 --> 00:58:39.733
-But both.

1098
00:58:39.777 --> 00:58:41.474
Well. so it goes.

1099
00:58:42.693 --> 00:58:44.738
-You'll be alright.
-Yeah.

1100
00:58:46.566 --> 00:58:49.569
Yeah. shit happens
when you party naked.

1101
00:59:20.731 --> 00:59:23.298
You know. for the longest time

1102
00:59:23.342 --> 00:59:25.562
I thought
that I was square enough

1103
00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:28.086
and I dedicated
just enough to a shitty job

1104
00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:30.610
that I didn't even care about
and I was alright with that.

1105
00:59:30.654 --> 00:59:33.918
Or at least find
some sort of solace
elsewhere aside from work.

1106
00:59:33.961 --> 00:59:36.703
But just statistically
speaking. right?

1107
00:59:36.747 --> 00:59:39.271
Because you spend
most of your life at work.

1108
00:59:39.314 --> 00:59:42.100
you very quickly
come to understand
that if you're miserable there

1109
00:59:42.143 --> 00:59:44.319
then your life is
predominantly miserable. right?

1110
00:59:44.363 --> 00:59:45.799
Aren't you going to help?

1111
00:59:45.843 --> 00:59:51.196
So... and so I left and now
I am at school with you

1112
00:59:51.239 --> 00:59:53.894
and I tried a lot of things
before to try to figure out

1113
00:59:53.938 --> 00:59:56.549
why I was. you know.
so bummed about things.

1114
00:59:57.724 --> 00:59:59.857
But. girl. never
in a million fucking years

1115
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.121
did I think that digging holes
in a farm was going to be
an answer to things.

1116
01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:05.993
You're fucking crazy for doing
this for a month. you know that?

1117
01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.691
I feel like
all I do is dig holes.

1118
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.170
Oh. yeah. whatever.

1119
01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:11.085
I don't believe
that for a second.

1120
01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:14.306
But how are you anyway?

1121
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:16.482
Have you been feeling better
about things?

1122
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.266
Yeah...

1123
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.269
I guess so.

1124
01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:24.664
Trying new things
to see at least.

1125
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.188
I'm a little bit worried
I'm kinda doing
exactly the same thing

1126
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:28.537
no matter where I am.

1127
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.452
What. like.
digging holes and shit?

1128
01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:33.847
No. that's actually new.
surprisingly enough.

1129
01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:37.329
No. I just mean
like the same patterns
of frustrations

1130
01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:39.113
and doing the same thing
in response

1131
01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:42.029
and like feeling trapped
and all of that.

1132
01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:46.468
Well. aren't you
just a little ray of sunshine?

1133
01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:49.776
But I mean. you know.
at least you're trying.

1134
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.519
You're out and you're working
toward positive at least.

1135
01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.260
so that's a good thing.

1136
01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:57.218
I just don't know
how I feel about

1137
01:00:57.262 --> 01:00:59.917
this whole "back to the earth"
thing though.

1138
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.832
-No?
-It's a bit crackers. babe.

1139
01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:05.444
You could give it a try.

1140
01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:08.142
Absolutely no go.

1141
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.880
That bartender
is definitely into you.

1142
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:54.014
Don't fucking look right at her.

1143
01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:55.102
Dude.

1144
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.936
Now. we're in for a real treat.

1145
01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.896
We're just going to...

1146
01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:07.941
Hi. my name's Laura

1147
01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:12.424
and I've sailed 13 oceans
and traveled 18 continents

1148
01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:15.601
waking up hungover people
all over the world.

1149
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.736
Hello you.

1150
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.260
How are you feeling?

1151
01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:10.047
Sorry.

1152
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:12.701
Honestly. immensely hungover.

1153
01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:15.008
Uh-oh. oops.

1154
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.974
Well. worth it.

1155
01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:26.411
Good.

1156
01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:29.109
You?

1157
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.938
Yeah. I think I'll...

1158
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.941
I think I'll live.

1159
01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:36.551
Mmm.

1160
01:03:36.595 --> 01:03:39.467
And don't you have to go?

1161
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.427
You kept saying last night.

1162
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.733
"I'm going
on an adventure tomorrow."

1163
01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:48.346
Oh. God. yeah.
that sounds like me.

1164
01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:25.426
You actually look like shit.

1165
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:29.691
It kinda looks like you got
into a fight with a semi-truck.

1166
01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:32.564
but it didn't just like hit you.
it just like smoked you

1167
01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:35.262
and then just drug you
for miles and miles.

1168
01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:36.916
Feel like a roadkill.

1169
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.181
I feel like my soul is hungover.

1170
01:04:41.225 --> 01:04:44.141
Yeah. you look like
a bad day had a long night.

1171
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:46.708
What?

1172
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.060
At least the bartender
seemed chill.

1173
01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:54.064
Yeah. yeah.

1174
01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:59.373
Good news is
she's already put up with me
smashed out of my mind so.

1175
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.201
I don't know.
you're pretty bad sober.

1176
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.515
Nice.

1177
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:12.778
Good job.

1178
01:05:16.564 --> 01:05:17.826
That's loud.

1179
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:22.440
but my hangover is worse.

1180
01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:25.443
Yeah. dude.
It's a gun. It goes bang.

1181
01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:29.229
How's your...

1182
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:31.753
how's your journey to the depths
of the meaninglessness
of existence going?

1183
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.715
Ah. it's nice to get out
of town for a bit.

1184
01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:40.458
Yeah. yeah. It's... it's good
for the soul out here you know.

1185
01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:43.983
Let the...
let the heat heal you.

1186
01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:46.681
But seriously though. you should
probably take some time off.

1187
01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:50.729
Yeah. maybe
a little trip out of town.

1188
01:05:50.772 --> 01:05:51.730
Oh. yeah.

1189
01:05:51.773 --> 01:05:53.862
Yeah. you know. whatever.

1190
01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.212
Uh. anyway.

1191
01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:58.606
hope your hangover
likes loud noises

1192
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:01.261
'cause it's about to get lit.

1193
01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:03.046
Freedom. baby!

1194
01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:05.091
Woo-hoo!

1195
01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:07.137
All right. you beautiful
little sulk-monster.
let's get some fucking drinks.

1196
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.965
-Now?
-Yes. right now.

1197
01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:11.010
We just finished
our Master's programs. Come on.

1198
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.317
It's like not even 11 o' clock.

1199
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.058
And come on. it doesn't matter.

1200
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:17.538
You don't have
to be sad forever.

1201
01:06:17.582 --> 01:06:20.193
Like let's go do something.
Let's go get some drinks.

1202
01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:22.804
-Let's have fun.
-Okay. All right. all right.

1203
01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:25.068
You do realize
that you're allowed to drink
when you're not sad

1204
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:27.157
like celebrating
once in a while is okay.

1205
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.810
Mm-hmm.

1206
01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.290
Plus. you don't have long before
they ship you back to California

1207
01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.466
where I hear
things are just so awful.

1208
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:33.815
What is that supposed to mean?

1209
01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:35.513
It means you have to drink
to forget about that.

1210
01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:37.036
Oh!

1211
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.604
All right. well. I thought
that was funny anyway.

1212
01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:42.172
You know. who gives a fuck
if this degree means shit

1213
01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.608
all just like our first degrees.

1214
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:47.438
It's like I'm done
and I'm happy at least for now.

1215
01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:49.831
So. I might as well
enjoy it. right?

1216
01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.137
Right?

1217
01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:52.704
Yes!

1218
01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:54.575
Drink when you're happy.
drink when you're sad.

1219
01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:55.837
the Erika story.

1220
01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:59.319
It's called
hair of the dog. okay?

1221
01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.626
- I'm not that drunk.
- It's hair of the dog.

1222
01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:03.193
If you drink it.
then you get over your...

1223
01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:04.498
-Are you on drugs today?
-Woo!

1224
01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:07.632
Woo-hoo! Yeah.
I'm on drugs bitches!

1225
01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:09.634
No. I'm not. Literally. I'm not.

1226
01:07:10.504 --> 01:07:12.332
No. I just want to party
with my boys.

1227
01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:14.334
I am so glad
that you're back

1228
01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:16.336
and I can't wait
to hear about everything.

1229
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.772
I'm going to get a drink.
do you want something?

1230
01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:19.078
Actually. no.
I'm going to go sit outside.

1231
01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.688
Oh. yeah.
it's so pretty outside.

1232
01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:22.081
Just a heads-up.
Michael's out there.

1233
01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.517
-Okay. That's fine.
-Okay. Alright.

1234
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.228
Hey.

1235
01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:41.318
Hello.

1236
01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:44.147
Uh...

1237
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:51.284
Good to see you.

1238
01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:52.807
You just got back. right?

1239
01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:55.071
Yeah. straight from Berlin.

1240
01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.638
How's that jet lag?
How's Germany?

1241
01:07:57.682 --> 01:08:01.947
I'm tired and Germany was great.

1242
01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:05.907
-Good to hear.
-Yeah.

1243
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:08.562
So. well. shit.

1244
01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:13.785
How's everything since we. uh...

1245
01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:17.267
It's been what. half a year?

1246
01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.312
Yes.

1247
01:08:19.356 --> 01:08:20.748
Miss the fog yet?

1248
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.838
It's actually a lot worse
than you can even imagine.

1249
01:08:23.882 --> 01:08:26.754
People take the day off
when the sun comes out.

1250
01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:29.148
Wow. that's the saddest thing
I've heard all year.

1251
01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:30.671
No. it was good.

1252
01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:33.935
I mean. I got sun in Berlin
and I have a Master's now.

1253
01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:35.285
Yay!

1254
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:37.200
Look at you. all educated.

1255
01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:38.418
Yeah.

1256
01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.162
How are you?

1257
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.383
Good. Yeah.

1258
01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:49.081
Same deal with work.

1259
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:54.304
but they're paying me more now.
so. that's chill.

1260
01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:59.483
How about you?
What's the future like
for Laura?

1261
01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:00.440
Oh. my God!

1262
01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:03.051
-Yeah. me too.
-Yeah.

1263
01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:05.358
At least you've got
a Master's now?

1264
01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:09.275
You know it works better
if you don't say it
like a question.

1265
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:14.280
Um. yeah.

1266
01:09:14.324 --> 01:09:18.893
No. I'm still kinda
in the same place
and feeling the same...

1267
01:09:20.547 --> 01:09:22.506
I don't even know
what the word is.

1268
01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.943
Inherently dissatisfied.

1269
01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:27.598
-I wasn't thinking
quite that sad.
-Okay.

1270
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:31.254
I'm thinking more like figuring
things out still. but. yeah.

1271
01:09:31.297 --> 01:09:33.778
Inherently dissatisfied
sounds better.

1272
01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:38.739
I'm sorry.
I'm just fucking around.

1273
01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:42.221
That's okay but. yeah. no.

1274
01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:45.833
I'm just again
trying to decide what to do.

1275
01:09:46.704 --> 01:09:47.966
Yeah. I feel that.

1276
01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:50.098
Yeah. between moving
and like finding a job.

1277
01:09:51.012 --> 01:09:53.928
I don't have a ton of time
to ponder. so that's nice.

1278
01:09:53.972 --> 01:09:56.801
I don't know if you know
what nice means.

1279
01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.238
Probably not.

1280
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.462
How are things outside of work?

1281
01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:11.076
All right. um.
a little bit of drinking.

1282
01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:13.600
a little bit of not drinking.

1283
01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:16.560
a little bit of traveling
around California.

1284
01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:18.126
which has been nice.

1285
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.867
-That does sound nice.
-Yeah.

1286
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:21.434
The mountains are pretty cool.

1287
01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:25.264
They've got tons of rocks
and snow.

1288
01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:30.182
Really just a bunch of stuff
that you can throw
at other stuff

1289
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.446
which is pretty much
the most fun a kid could have.

1290
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:36.841
Oh. my God!
I'm glad your sense
of humor is still strange.

1291
01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:43.761
What about you?
What kind of fun did you
get into after everything?

1292
01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:48.287
Ooh. uh. honestly
I kinda just went out a lot.

1293
01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:53.031
Super honestly. um.

1294
01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:58.689
I was pretty miserable
and did a lot of drinking.

1295
01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:01.474
-So. yeah. you know.
-The healthy way out?

1296
01:11:01.518 --> 01:11:02.606
Yeah.

1297
01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:04.738
How about now?

1298
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.787
Better. I think.

1299
01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:12.833
Yeah. better.

1300
01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:19.013
-Yeah.
-I've made some changes
for the better. so.

1301
01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:23.975
Uh. would you say
you're doing better?

1302
01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.324
Yeah. better.

1303
01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.458
Like better or...?

1304
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:31.199
I mean. maybe better
than better actually. you know.

1305
01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.463
Perhaps the betterest.

1306
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.943
If you will.

1307
01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:39.947
Mmm.

1308
01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.134
You know how when you travel

1309
01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:55.223
or like when people
are traveling.
they're always like.

1310
01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:58.226
"I feel so aware
when I'm traveling"

1311
01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.925
and like discovering
this new culture makes me feel

1312
01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:02.883
like all my worries
are like so silly.

1313
01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:07.627
Uh. yeah. you mean
the. "Going to Thailand
was amazing.

1314
01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:10.456
and it's so amazing
to travel the world.

1315
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.415
and life is amazing"

1316
01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.547
approach to "finding yourself".

1317
01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:17.376
also known
as being rich as shit.

1318
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.859
And you know
or pretending everything's okay.

1319
01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:24.165
Yeah. No.
it's fucking bullshit. isn't it?

1320
01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:26.037
I mean. like it is
and it isn't but. yeah.

1321
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.560
Hey. you don't
have to convince me.

1322
01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:31.303
I mean. I love traveling
and food while I'm traveling.

1323
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.654
But. yeah. I mean.
finding yourself on vacation

1324
01:12:34.698 --> 01:12:37.178
has gotta be probably
one the worst clichÃ©s

1325
01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:40.225
this side of "everything happens
for a reason."

1326
01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:43.097
Yeah. exactly.

1327
01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:45.404
Yeah. I mean like for me
at least I felt like

1328
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:51.149
the moments of traveling
that were the most beneficial
were when...

1329
01:12:51.192 --> 01:12:53.151
I mean. it kinda like
could have been anywhere.

1330
01:12:53.194 --> 01:12:57.285
Like it was like the moments
where I was the most
miserably alone. you know.

1331
01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.809
and just had to live
with myself.

1332
01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:00.767
Yeah. I'd agree with that.

1333
01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:03.379
So. I take it things are fun?

1334
01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:06.947
No. I'm just complaining.
Things are very good.

1335
01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.515
Yeah. Gotta do it sometimes.

1336
01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:15.391
I gotta be honest though.
I think.

1337
01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:19.656
sometimes even with living
with yourself

1338
01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:23.660
and even like
enjoying yourself as a person

1339
01:13:23.703 --> 01:13:28.491
really doesn't lift
the weight of.

1340
01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:31.885
you know.
what we talked about way back

1341
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:36.716
about being trapped
by having so many options.

1342
01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.326
I don't know if that like...

1343
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.589
No. no. I remember it. Yeah.

1344
01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:42.592
No. I felt like...

1345
01:13:42.635 --> 01:13:45.333
I felt like at first. you know.

1346
01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:48.989
being present was like really
helpful and like. you know.

1347
01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:51.165
just kinda like choosing
how to do your things

1348
01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:55.387
or like perceive experiences
and stuff.

1349
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:58.738
But it kinda got tiring.

1350
01:13:58.782 --> 01:13:59.783
And like...

1351
01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:06.920
Like I know that receiving
information and experiences

1352
01:14:06.964 --> 01:14:09.749
was like. of course.
good for me.

1353
01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:13.231
but... I don't know.

1354
01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:15.625
I guess it kinda feels weird

1355
01:14:15.668 --> 01:14:18.802
to just be like learning
about things and about yourself

1356
01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:21.369
and to like not get anywhere.

1357
01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:24.285
you know. just like
I'm still completely unprepared
to answer the question

1358
01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:26.113
of like what I want
to do with my life.

1359
01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:28.899
And it's like after
all this time and education
and everything.

1360
01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:30.683
it's still like I'm doing
the same shit.

1361
01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.468
which is. yeah.
basically my fucking life.

1362
01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.737
I guess as long as I'm not
fucking things up more.

1363
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.088
You know. I kinda think

1364
01:14:44.131 --> 01:14:47.004
sometimes it's the only thing
you can do.

1365
01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:55.055
I did miss you.

1366
01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:58.581
I missed you too.

1367
01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:17.643
Moving back to Portland?

1368
01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:19.645
Um. no.

1369
01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:23.170
I'm going to go home.
figure things out.

1370
01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.260
That's chill.

1371
01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:27.914
California misses you.

1372
01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:29.742
Yeah. what?

1373
01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:34.181
I don't know.
I'm just saying shit.

1374
01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:41.754
-Should we head inside?

1375
01:15:41.798 --> 01:15:44.365
Get new drinks?

1376
01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:45.541
Oh. yeah.

1377
01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:51.024
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

1378
01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:13.917
What we should talk
about is the graduation story.

1379
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.701
- Yeah. yeah.
- Right?

1380
01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:40.204
When they're out of reach...

1381
01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:45.209
I'm tired.

1382
01:16:47.515 --> 01:16:48.865
That makes sense.

1383
01:16:48.908 --> 01:16:51.607
You did literally
just fly across the world.

1384
01:16:52.564 --> 01:16:53.521
True.

1385
01:16:57.264 --> 01:16:58.483
Are you trying to head out?

1386
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.703
No. I'm alright.

1387
01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:03.836
Cool.

1388
01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:27.120
I'm sorry.

1389
01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:31.429
No. don't be.

1390
01:17:40.003 --> 01:17:40.960
Hey there.

1391
01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:45.182
Hi.

1392
01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:51.928
This is new.
What does it say?

1393
01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:53.756
Oh. yeah.

1394
01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:57.237
-Could be worse.
-Oh. my God! You would.

1395
01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:00.501
I try.

1396
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.268
Hi.

1397
01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:34.231
No. I'm okay. I overslept
in... where are we?

1398
01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:36.363
-Echo Park.
-Echo Park.

1399
01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:42.805
Okay. Okay. cool.
I'll be over soon then.

1400
01:18:42.848 --> 01:18:43.980
Yeah. I'll figure it out.

1401
01:18:45.198 --> 01:18:46.156
Okay. thanks.

1402
01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:53.119
You. uh. need a ride?

1403
01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:57.863
Oh. um... really?

1404
01:18:58.777 --> 01:19:02.433
Yeah. it's a fucking car ride
not a kidney.

1405
01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:03.826
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1406
01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:05.566
Where's your...
where does your friend live?

1407
01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.133
Let me pull it up.

1408
01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:08.700
-It's... it's my cousin. it's...
-Oh!

1409
01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:11.921
Yeah. that's right here.

1410
01:19:26.979 --> 01:19:29.112
-Thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

1411
01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:32.942
Uh...

1412
01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:35.335
Let me know
if you're visiting again.

1413
01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:38.034
It was...
it was good to see you.

1414
01:19:38.077 --> 01:19:39.687
Yeah. it was good
to see you too.

1415
01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:43.866
-Have a good day.
-You too.

1416
01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:46.172
Good luck with everything.

1417
01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:47.173
Thank you.

1418
01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:50.786
Thank you. again for the ride.

1419
01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:52.178
No problem.

1420
01:20:28.562 --> 01:20:30.477
Oh. Oh. okay.

1421
01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:31.696
All right. cool. Bye.

1422
01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.177
Bye.

1423
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.465
You alright?

1424
01:21:01.508 --> 01:21:04.250
Yeah. yeah.
I'm just pretty tired.

1425
01:21:05.295 --> 01:21:06.644
It seems to be a thing with you.

1426
01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:08.211
Is it?

1427
01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:12.911
Yeah. I mean. I get it.
It's... it's whatever.

1428
01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:15.305
Next time we go out.

1429
01:21:15.348 --> 01:21:19.918
we should just not
and like take a nap instead.

1430
01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:21.180
Okay.

1431
01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:23.182
I could... I could do that.

1432
01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:25.837
Yeah. but it's always very fun.

1433
01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:28.013
Good.

1434
01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.192
Hey.
I'm going to head out.

1435
01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.847
Try and get some sleep
this time.

1436
01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:23.460
I'll see you.

1437
01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:31.294
Hi. future me.
This is Michael.

1438
01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:34.993
You know that already
because you're me.

1439
01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.910
Uh. anyhow this is day one

1440
01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:43.610
of Michael's poorly
planned road trip
to fix his fucking head

1441
01:22:43.654 --> 01:22:46.004
or at least
take some real time off.

1442
01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:49.616
I'd like to remind future me
why I'm on this trip.

1443
01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.619
This year was dumb.
Last year was dumb.

1444
01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:55.448
And next year
will probably be dumb.

1445
01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:59.975
I hate my job even though
it's not that bad and pays well.

1446
01:23:00.018 --> 01:23:03.369
Give a shit about a girl
who's hundreds of miles away

1447
01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:07.678
while another girl
who's too good for me
or at least seems pretty chill

1448
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:09.027
is waiting for my time.

1449
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:11.247
I'm healthy.
I have enough money.

1450
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.553
which is pretty much
anything I've ever asked for.

1451
01:23:13.597 --> 01:23:16.861
but despite
my best efforts to ignore it.

1452
01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:19.211
my head is still
completely fucked

1453
01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:23.041
which is naturally
a bit irritating.

1454
01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:25.565
And I have no idea
what the fuck to do about it.

1455
01:23:25.609 --> 01:23:29.787
so I'm taking this trip to.
uh. to do anything...

1456
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:35.010
just something new.
just to do something different.

1457
01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:39.405
I guess this is the best
I've felt for a while.

1458
01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:41.538
probably a long time.

1459
01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:44.584
Anyway. I'm hungover

1460
01:23:44.628 --> 01:23:47.326
and seem to be
out of things to say.

1461
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:49.981
So. I'll return to this later.

1462
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.941
God speed to me I guess.
