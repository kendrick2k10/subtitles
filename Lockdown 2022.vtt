00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.296
Okay. Cherry.
all cards are on the table.

4
00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.198
We got a serious problem here.

5
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:10.834
Turning tricks is one thing.
but robbery that's a felony.

6
00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:13.837
And robbery with a weapon.
that's robbery first degree.

7
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.040
You're looking at
five years minimum.

8
00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:18.943
Come on. Captain.

9
00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:21.178
You detectives
have been trying to pin

10
00:04:21.212 --> 00:04:25.416
that robbery shit
on one of us girls for months.

11
00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.985
It's bullshit and you know it.

12
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.300
Hands in the cage. animal.

13
00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.813
Fuck! You don't
wanna fucking do this!

14
00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.328
You're not gonna
fucking get away with this.

15
00:05:01.352 --> 00:05:02.752
What the fuck did you just...

16
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:04.221
Shut the fuck up!

17
00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:06.223
Night-night. bitch.

18
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.161
Snake...

19
00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.869
Wait for my signal. okay.

20
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:21.539
Stay in the cell.

21
00:05:21.572 --> 00:05:24.008
- Wait till I get dressed.
- Right. Okay.

22
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.011
I know we got your DNA
all over that room.

23
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.983
I fucked that dude. I admit it.
I fucked that dude hard.

24
00:05:33.017 --> 00:05:36.320
I'd be shocked if my DNA
wasn't in the room.

25
00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:41.892
But DNA is not robbery.
you stupid damn motherfucker! Asshole.

26
00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:47.198
Be ready.

27
00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.618
Come on. Cherry. help me out.

28
00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:10.120
You help me and I'll help you.

29
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.427
No!

30
00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:19.230
You know what?

31
00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:20.431
I didn't Rob anybody.

32
00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:24.134
and I'm tired
of the goddamn scam.

33
00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:26.870
You're charging me with felony.
I want a lawyer.

34
00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:28.838
You want a lawyer?
I'll get you a lawyer.

35
00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:32.977
But in the meantime. you're gonna
hang out with the boys down in holding.

36
00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:35.980
Fuck you.

37
00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:39.550
Can I help you officer?

38
00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:41.051

00:06:53.497 --> 00:06:56.766
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut the fuck up. you're next.

45
00:06:58.535 --> 00:07:00.070

Okay. all right.

Everybody down!

00:07:59.997 --> 00:08:02.066
Go. Raj. get 'em!

Sit down. come here.

00:08:07.037 --> 00:08:09.106

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.501
Put it on!

78
00:08:57.087 --> 00:08:58.655
Do her. man.

79
00:09:11.535 --> 00:09:13.170
Now what. man?

80
00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:16.306
Now...

81
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:22.379
Now we wait.

82
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:31.789
Shit...

83
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:34.091
Shit... Shit!

84
00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:37.194
Fuck.

85
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.435
Patch me through.

86
00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.069
Right away.

87
00:10:13.096 --> 00:10:17.067
- What?
- This is FBI Special Agent Roger Kinkaid.

88
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.402
Who am I speaking to?

89
00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:20.137
This is McMasters.

90
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.875
and I have the captain
and a few other pigs in here.

91
00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:26.878
Okay. Mr. McMasters.

92
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.479
What do you want from us?

93
00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:30.814
I don't know.

94
00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:32.983
Let me get back
to you about that.

95
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:38.489
Shit.

96
00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:41.325
What do we do now?

97
00:10:41.358 --> 00:10:44.194
There's nothing we can do
until he calls back.

98
00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:06.951
Okay. what do
we know about these three men?

99
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:11.288
Okay. Frank Williamson
a.k.a. Snake.

100
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:16.426
he is a convicted rapist.
gun and drug smuggler.

101
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.395
He's been arrested
multiple times

102
00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.498
and his attorney always
finds a way to get him off.

103
00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.668
Rajesh Carnak.

104
00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:28.672
a.k.a. the Midnight Strangler.
the famous serial killer.

105
00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:31.208
- He's the one responsible...
- Okay. okay.

106
00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:33.677
I'm very familiar with
this case. Let's move on.

107
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.346
Mike McMasters.

108
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.516
Paranoid schizophrenic
and the leader of this group.

109
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:44.087
He was arrested for homicide
and got off scot-free.

110
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:47.324
Apparently there wasn't
enough evidence to convict him.

111
00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:50.160
The three have a long history.

112
00:11:50.193 --> 00:11:52.262
They've known each other
for years.

113
00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.498
They've been
incarcerated together

114
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:57.234
and wanted to form
some sort of alliance

115
00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.803
to bring terror
to small communities.

116
00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:02.874
eventually working their way
up to larger cities.

117
00:12:02.907 --> 00:12:04.976
Thank God they
didn't get to do that.

118
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:08.178
Yes. but look what happened now.

119
00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:13.717
A rapist. a serial killer and a paranoid
schizophrenic holding hostages.

120
00:12:15.218 --> 00:12:17.421
What a fucking mess.

121
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.969
Hey.

122
00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:33.103
Look what I found.

123
00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:38.475
Hey. can we keep her?

124
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:43.146
Better yet. can I have her?

125
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.148
She's all yours.

126
00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:47.351
- You can't do that!
- Shut the fuck up!

127
00:12:47.384 --> 00:12:51.154
- Sit your ass down.
- Hey. I found her. she's mine.

128
00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:54.224
He said I could have her.
dammit. not you.

129
00:12:54.257 --> 00:12:56.995
Fuck. chicken head.
I fucking found her.

130
00:12:57.028 --> 00:12:58.997
- I'm taking her.
- That's enough!

131
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.033
Officer. it's scary.

132
00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:03.734
He looks so evil.

133
00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:06.803
I know one minute you're mean.
the next minute

134
00:13:06.837 --> 00:13:09.172
you're a good. good cop.

135
00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:12.476
I'm in good hands. right?
You won't hurt me.

136
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:13.978
Will you take her over there?

137
00:13:14.012 --> 00:13:16.023
We'll figure out what we're
gonna do with her later on.

138
00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:18.016
- Get over there.
- Don't hurt me.

139
00:13:20.517 --> 00:13:22.386
I know what I'm gonna
do with her later on.

140
00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:25.255
You ain't doing shit.

141
00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:27.591
Thank God she's mine. man.

142
00:13:27.624 --> 00:13:29.226
Are you okay?

143
00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:32.162
He's not a cop.

144
00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:33.931
Knock off the chit chat.

145
00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:41.638
Thanks.

146
00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:09.633
McMasters. right?

147
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:14.538
Look. uh. you can still
get out of this.

148
00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:17.240
All you gotta do
is let us all go.

149
00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:19.609
I mean. I'll put in a good word
for you and the others.

150
00:14:19.643 --> 00:14:23.047
Look. I'll tell the FBI you
didn't hurt me or any of my guys.

151
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.749
They'll just think...

152
00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.783
Hey!

153
00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:32.389
Oh. no. no.

154
00:14:34.192 --> 00:14:36.326
Don't worry. sweetheart.
He's only sleeping.

155
00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:38.295
- He needs a doctor.
- Get her ass down.

156
00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:39.663
You bastard!

157
00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:45.602
- What do we do now?
- We got in this together.

158
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.405
we'll get out of it.
We got this.

159
00:14:48.438 --> 00:14:51.475
Maybe we could use these pigs
as bargaining chips. huh?

160
00:14:51.508 --> 00:14:52.843
What do you think they're worth?

161
00:14:54.544 --> 00:14:57.347
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars each?

162
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.382
They ain't worth
a hundred grand.

163
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:01.853
Get the fuck out of my face.

164
00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:04.755
Look. man.
it's a million dollars.

165
00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:07.491
That's what they're worth.
that's what we're gonna get.

166
00:15:07.524 --> 00:15:10.070
- We gotta lock this place down.
- Go get it done. it's your job.

167
00:15:10.094 --> 00:15:11.695
I got it.

168
00:15:11.728 --> 00:15:13.530
What are we gonna do
with that bitch?

169
00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:15.532
Officer...

170
00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:18.568
I'm sure you make
a lot of money.

171
00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:20.570
I have a daughter. she needs me.

172
00:15:20.604 --> 00:15:23.807
I'm not that bright
so I'm useless here. can I go?

173
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:27.011
We're gonna have
a lot of fun with her.

174
00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:30.081
Later.

175
00:15:30.114 --> 00:15:31.748
Much later.

176
00:15:31.782 --> 00:15:33.316
No. I'm useless.

177
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.989
You listen and sit
your fucking ass down.

178
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:39.723
Now!

179
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.825
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.400
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:06.783
I'm gonna call.

182
00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:16.426
Yes?

183
00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:20.397
McMasters. it's Roger Kinkaid.

184
00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:22.967
<i>Ready to talk now?</i>

185
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.635
Sure.

186
00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:29.106
But first.
is there anybody hurt in there?

187
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.242
Anybody need medical attention?

188
00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:32.509
<i>Everybody's fine.</i>

189
00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:36.746
- For now.
- <i>Okay.</i>

190
00:16:38.282 --> 00:16:41.285
So what exactly
do you want from us?

191
00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:47.457
Well. for starters
I want four million apiece.

192
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.793
<i>A million for each pig here.</i>

193
00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:52.829
And for the captain.

194
00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:59.603
I want a chopper. a pilot
and a full tank of gas.

195
00:17:01.973 --> 00:17:05.642
And the bitch.
you can have her for free.

196
00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:06.944
Got this?

197
00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:09.613
<i>Consider it a gift</i>

198
00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:11.883
<i>from me to you</i>

199
00:17:11.916 --> 00:17:13.683
<i>since I'm so polite.</i>

200
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.287
What girl?

201
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.890
Well. well. well.

202
00:17:18.923 --> 00:17:23.393
For someone who works in
the intelligence field.

203
00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:25.096
you sure don't have much.
do you?

204
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.137
She's nothing. she's a whore.

205
00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:35.572
We found her.

206
00:17:35.605 --> 00:17:37.909
<i>That's why you get it for free.</i>

207
00:17:37.942 --> 00:17:43.347
McMasters. you gotta realize that
we can't get $4 million that quickly.

208
00:17:43.381 --> 00:17:45.715
Listen to me. you fuck!

209
00:17:45.749 --> 00:17:47.550
I'm the one in charge here!

210
00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:50.388
<i>Do you get this?</i>

211
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.257
And if I don't have
these demands.

212
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:57.328
I will start killing these
people one by one every hour.

213
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:58.561
You got that. amigo?

214
00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:01.631
<i>And as for the bitch.</i>

215
00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:04.368
we will fuck her.
we will gut her.

216
00:18:04.402 --> 00:18:07.071
and we will kill her.
and fuck her again!

217
00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:09.673
Not in that particular order.

218
00:18:09.706 --> 00:18:11.708
I think you get the point.

219
00:18:12.475 --> 00:18:14.011
You have one hour.

220
00:18:16.881 --> 00:18:18.481
Fuck.

221
00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:20.418
Fuck!

222
00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:31.295
Where did this girl come from?

223
00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:33.097
I don't know.

224
00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:43.341
The problem
with a paranoid schizophrenic

225
00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:45.910
is we never know
who we're actually talking to.

226
00:18:45.943 --> 00:18:48.312
What are you doing here.
Rodriguez?

227
00:18:48.346 --> 00:18:50.647
- Move.
- By whose authority?

228
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.183
I'm in charge now.

229
00:19:01.624 --> 00:19:04.095
McMasters. this is Rodriguez.

230
00:19:04.128 --> 00:19:05.595
Who's this?

231
00:19:07.198 --> 00:19:09.599
Put Kinkaid on the line.

232
00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:13.337
McMasters. this is Rodriguez
and I'm in charge now.

233
00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:15.839
Listen. I'm in charge!

234
00:19:15.873 --> 00:19:19.276
Listen. McMasters.
I'm not here to play your games.

235
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.146
Put Captain Davis
on the phone now.

236
00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:23.981
Oh... Oh. yeah?

237
00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:32.089
<i>Fuck!</i>

238
00:19:32.123 --> 00:19:33.590
You... fuck you!

239
00:19:33.623 --> 00:19:35.993
Calm your ass!
Calm the fuck down!

240
00:19:36.027 --> 00:19:37.895
What have you done?

241
00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.766
Did you see what you made me do?

242
00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.702
That one's on you.

243
00:19:45.735 --> 00:19:48.205
Put Kinkaid on the line now.

244
00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:49.739
I'm here.

245
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.879
Kinkaid. I want my money.

246
00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:56.247
You got an hour.

247
00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:02.786
You SWAT guys.

248
00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:06.057
you're a hammer.
but not every problem is a nail.

249
00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.925
You did this.

250
00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:13.931
Oh. my God.

251
00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:15.866
Get her out of here.

252
00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:28.112
You bastard asshole!

253
00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:48.598
No! You bastard!

254
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:56.806
We know all about Captain Davis.
but what do we know about the hooker?

255
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.741
We don't know anything
about the hooker.

256
00:20:58.775 --> 00:21:02.012
Honestly. McMasters
is our problem.

257
00:21:02.046 --> 00:21:05.416
Look. it may not be in his file.

258
00:21:05.449 --> 00:21:07.585
but he claimed
during his last trial

259
00:21:07.617 --> 00:21:10.753
that he blacks out
before he kills.

260
00:21:10.787 --> 00:21:13.623
He killed six members
of the Stephenson family.

261
00:21:13.656 --> 00:21:16.393
and then he said
he didn't remember any of it.

262
00:21:16.427 --> 00:21:19.897
He's a killer.
They all have their story.

263
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.401
Cindy Stephenson.
the only survivor.

264
00:21:24.435 --> 00:21:26.437
watched him kill
her entire family

265
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.441
and he was armed only with
his fist while reciting Psalms Ten.

266
00:21:30.474 --> 00:21:33.077
Psalms 10?

267
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.146
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

268
00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:39.216
It's some Psalm revolving
around evil against God and such.

269
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.152
Some weird shit.

270
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.623
She also said
that he appeared to be dreaming

271
00:21:45.655 --> 00:21:48.092
in some sort of trance.

272
00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:51.195
so much that he
couldn't even see her.

273
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.301
Kinkaid... trust me...

274
00:21:58.302 --> 00:22:00.871
McMasters is our problem.

275
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:19.990
- Chow time. huh?
- Hell yeah.

276
00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:23.693
- You guys feel like pizza?
- Yeah. that sounds good to me.

277
00:22:24.595 --> 00:22:27.932
Yeah. me too.

278
00:22:27.965 --> 00:22:29.466
You know. I was thinking...

279
00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:35.206
wasn't this your girlfriend's?

280
00:22:56.026 --> 00:22:57.294
Kinkaid.

281
00:22:58.596 --> 00:23:00.297
We're ready for lunch now.

282
00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:01.966
McMasters...

283
00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.101
Uh. we have sandwiches.

284
00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:06.437
We'll send in some sandwiches.
how's that?

285
00:23:07.404 --> 00:23:09.206
No. we'll take pizza. pepperoni.

286
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.611
No. you can't just call us
and order pizza like that.

287
00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:16.947
Listen.
I'm in charge here. okay?

288
00:23:16.981 --> 00:23:18.649
And we'll take pizza.

289
00:23:18.682 --> 00:23:20.317
<i>No. no. I'm not doing this.</i>

290
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:23.554
We'll send you in the same
sandwiches that we have.

291
00:23:23.587 --> 00:23:25.122
<i>That's it.</i>

292
00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:28.758
Guys...

293
00:23:44.742 --> 00:23:46.744
Tell 'em. Tell. 'em. tell 'em!

294
00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:48.679
You tell 'em
and they'll feed us.

295
00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:50.581
Yeah.

296
00:23:50.614 --> 00:23:51.649
Yeah.

297
00:23:51.682 --> 00:23:53.783
Okay.

298
00:23:53.816 --> 00:23:55.719
What? I can't hear you.

299
00:23:55.753 --> 00:23:58.355
- Okay. okay. stop.
- We're getting our pizza?

300
00:23:58.389 --> 00:24:00.090
We'll get you your damn pizza.

301
00:24:00.124 --> 00:24:01.892
Get this bitch out of my face!

302
00:24:01.925 --> 00:24:04.428
Take her out of here!

303
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:09.166
Kinkaid. you need to start
listening to what I say!

304
00:24:10.267 --> 00:24:12.770
Do everything I say.
whatever I want.

305
00:24:12.802 --> 00:24:15.773
you give it to me. motherfucker!
You hear me?!

306
00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:18.442
<i>Or I'll fucking kill everybody!</i>

307
00:24:18.475 --> 00:24:20.711
We will all die!

308
00:24:20.744 --> 00:24:22.479
Fuck you!

309
00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:29.486
Fuck!

310
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.289
Fuck!

311
00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:37.161
Fuck you!

312
00:24:51.442 --> 00:24:53.610
John. yeah. Kinkaid.

313
00:24:53.644 --> 00:24:55.646
Yeah. right.

314
00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:57.981
Listen. I need a favor.

315
00:24:58.015 --> 00:25:00.184
You gotta get us some pizzas.

316
00:25:00.884 --> 00:25:02.686
No. no. no. no.

317
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.023
Just the-the real delivery boy.

318
00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:08.258
No. we'll take
responsibility for him.

319
00:25:08.292 --> 00:25:12.062
Pizzas and the delivery boy.
understand?

320
00:25:12.096 --> 00:25:14.865
No... no. wire.
no camera. nothing.

321
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:21.438
Right. All right. We're waiting.

322
00:25:32.449 --> 00:25:35.285
So where do you guys
wanna start from now?

323
00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.955
I've been reading up
on McMasters' file.

324
00:25:37.988 --> 00:25:40.457
and he fancies himself
a lady's man.

325
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:42.493
So I'm gonna give him
a chance to be one.

326
00:25:42.526 --> 00:25:45.295
So what are you gonna do.
flirt with him?

327
00:25:47.097 --> 00:25:50.100
Oh. this will be the first
flirtatious negotiation

328
00:25:50.134 --> 00:25:52.403
I've had the pleasure
of ever experiencing.

329
00:25:52.436 --> 00:25:57.107
No. I'm gonna play to his ego
and find out what started this shit.

330
00:25:57.141 --> 00:25:59.543
Well. let me ask you this.

331
00:25:59.576 --> 00:26:01.912
Do you need a moment
to put on your make up?

332
00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:04.081
What is that supposed to mean?

333
00:26:04.114 --> 00:26:06.550
Whoa. hang on.

334
00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:08.786
We got a real problem here.
We gotta act quickly.

335
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:13.157
Did you know that McMasters
is a paranoid schizophrenic

336
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.426
and is normally under
heavy medication?

337
00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:17.327
I read something
about that in his file.

338
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:20.264
And claustrophobia
is part of his pathology.

339
00:26:20.297 --> 00:26:23.834
No. No. I didn't know that.
What's your point?

340
00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:27.872
His murder revolves around
his schizophrenia

341
00:26:27.906 --> 00:26:30.307
and it's triggered by
enclosed spaces.

342
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.278
Okay. the bullpen
is larger than his cell.

343
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:39.116
My point is that when he's in his cell.
he's getting daily medication.

344
00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:41.985
Son of a bitch.

345
00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:43.720
We are well past that now.

346
00:26:43.754 --> 00:26:45.956
He could explode at any moment.

347
00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:00.304
Look what I found.

348
00:27:00.337 --> 00:27:02.172
Fucking food. finally.

349
00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:04.909
Put that pizza there
right there.

350
00:27:04.943 --> 00:27:07.044
Check his ass for wires.

351
00:27:08.412 --> 00:27:10.013
Put your hands up.

352
00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:14.318
Turn around.

353
00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:20.324
Okay. he's clean.

354
00:27:22.726 --> 00:27:26.497
You're kind of cute. huh? Think I might
wanna keep you to play with you for a while.

355
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.131
Hey. Raj. check him out.

356
00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:30.969
Yeah. nothing to check out.

357
00:27:31.001 --> 00:27:32.669
Not my style.

358
00:27:32.703 --> 00:27:33.972
Hey. you got me.

359
00:27:34.037 --> 00:27:36.773
- Leave him alone.
- Shut the fuck up and sit down.

360
00:27:36.807 --> 00:27:38.375
Knock it off.

361
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.447
Pizza boy...

362
00:27:44.883 --> 00:27:46.650
I got a message for you.

363
00:27:49.753 --> 00:27:54.191
It's for Roger Kinkaid.
the FBI agent in charge out there.

364
00:27:54.224 --> 00:27:59.196
You tell him
Mike McMasters says hello.

365
00:28:00.564 --> 00:28:05.469
And that I'm right here
whenever he wants to see me.

366
00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:09.874
And you let him know

367
00:28:09.908 --> 00:28:14.144
that his captain and all
his fellow officers are okay.

368
00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:16.580
Everyone's fine.

369
00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:19.783
And remind him
about the money he owes me.

370
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.387
Can you do that for me?

371
00:28:31.595 --> 00:28:33.597
Don't fuck up.

372
00:28:36.366 --> 00:28:38.735
Now if I were you.
I'd pick that up.

373
00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:42.806
Get the fuck out of here.

374
00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:03.928
It's a shame your lady

375
00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:05.696
isn't gonna get down
on this pizza.

376
00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:06.763
You hungry?

377
00:29:08.699 --> 00:29:09.934
You okay?

378
00:29:09.968 --> 00:29:11.735
Hey. you okay?

379
00:29:27.217 --> 00:29:30.487
You. my friend...

380
00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:35.525
Where's Falcon?

381
00:29:36.894 --> 00:29:38.295
Where's Falcon?!

382
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.531
They-they killed her. Captain.

383
00:29:41.565 --> 00:29:44.668
- What?
- They fucking killed her!

384
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:48.906
Fuck you!

385
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.075
Go and shoot me!
Fucking shoot me!

386
00:29:51.109 --> 00:29:53.111
No. you-you bastards.

387
00:29:53.143 --> 00:29:55.113
You fucking bastards!

388
00:29:55.145 --> 00:29:57.848
You fucking mother
son of a bitch.

389
00:29:57.882 --> 00:30:00.183
McMasters. you're gonna fry!

390
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:01.718
You are so gonna fucking fry.

391
00:30:01.752 --> 00:30:04.154
and I'm gonna put the needle
in your arm my fucking self!

392
00:30:04.187 --> 00:30:06.790
Or I'll fucking kill you myself
right fucking now.

393
00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:08.126
you fucking asshole!

394
00:30:08.158 --> 00:30:10.827
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you! Fuck...

395
00:30:12.864 --> 00:30:14.331
Fuck you!

396
00:30:14.364 --> 00:30:17.834
Shut the fuck up!
I will fucking kill you!

397
00:30:17.869 --> 00:30:19.779
If I just wanna kill anybody.
I'm gonna kill you!

398
00:30:19.803 --> 00:30:22.372
You got that?
You fucking piece of shit!

399
00:30:22.406 --> 00:30:25.409
- Fuck you!
- No. please. no!

400
00:30:25.442 --> 00:30:26.543
Sit down.

401
00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:34.384
- No.
- What's your problem?

402
00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:39.857
You think...
You think I'm afraid of you?

403
00:30:39.891 --> 00:30:44.461
No. You're a bastard.
but I lived with one.

404
00:30:45.228 --> 00:30:48.432
Yeah? What was he like?

405
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:51.468
My daughter's father.

406
00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:54.571
I thought I married a good man

407
00:30:54.604 --> 00:30:57.975
and we were gonna live
happily after.

408
00:30:58.009 --> 00:31:03.981
But. you know. he's like you.
lunatic motherfucker serial killer.

409
00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:08.385
- Yeah.
- You know. he turned on me.

410
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:12.990
- Good.
- Just when my daughter turned one year old.

411
00:31:13.024 --> 00:31:17.360
That night he...
I never seen that face.

412
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.600
One hand had gun.
the other hand he had a scissor.

413
00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:27.504
And he pointed at me.
asked me to choose.

414
00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:33.543
You know. you kill me
or kill my daughter.

415
00:31:34.145 --> 00:31:35.980
What'd you choose?

416
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.918
Come on. what you choose?

417
00:31:40.952 --> 00:31:43.487
I couldn't. I wouldn't.

418
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:46.224
He's a bastard.

419
00:31:46.256 --> 00:31:49.326
I got lucky
but it was a nightmare.

420
00:31:51.062 --> 00:31:54.232
You know why I like him?

421
00:31:54.264 --> 00:31:56.134
He's passionate.

422
00:31:56.167 --> 00:31:58.936
Turns me on just like you.

423
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.403
Just like me. huh?

424
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:07.778
You're just a fucking whore.

425
00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:10.480
Only a whore.

426
00:32:10.514 --> 00:32:12.449
You know what happened to him?

427
00:32:12.482 --> 00:32:15.318
What? What happened?

428
00:32:16.453 --> 00:32:20.490
He got crushed by a car.
terrible accident.

429
00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:23.227
You know. life's a bitch. right?

430
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:24.896
Huh?

431
00:32:26.164 --> 00:32:28.933
- Yeah. it is.
- Hey.

432
00:32:28.966 --> 00:32:31.235
- Hey.
- What. what?

433
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:34.939
If I fuck you.
you're not gonna hurt me. right?

434
00:32:34.972 --> 00:32:37.074
If I fuck you. no?

435
00:32:38.075 --> 00:32:40.278
- No.
- No.

436
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.612
- No. great.
- I won't hurt you.

437
00:32:44.347 --> 00:32:45.849
I'll fuck you.

438
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.789
If I fuck you...

439
00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:58.095
I will have no choice
but to hurt you.

440
00:32:58.129 --> 00:32:59.663
Do you understand?

441
00:32:59.696 --> 00:33:02.967
- I'll fuck you good.
- Yes.

442
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.036
- Yes.
- Yeah.

443
00:33:08.371 --> 00:33:10.540
We're good. right?

444
00:33:11.775 --> 00:33:13.144
Yeah.

445
00:33:13.177 --> 00:33:15.112
Yeah. you can have some pizza.

446
00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:48.913
Kinkaid.
your time's running out.

447
00:33:48.946 --> 00:33:50.480
You have my demands?

448
00:33:50.513 --> 00:33:52.016
<i>We have the money.</i>

449
00:33:52.049 --> 00:33:54.851
<i>but you're gonna
have to wait five minutes.</i>

450
00:33:54.886 --> 00:33:57.188
I want everything.

451
00:33:57.221 --> 00:33:59.957
and if I don't get it
in five minutes.

452
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:02.492
another one
of your people's gonna die.

453
00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:13.137
Hey.

454
00:34:14.804 --> 00:34:15.873
Hey.

455
00:34:18.242 --> 00:34:19.809
Why don't you let us go?

456
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.713
Please. please.

457
00:34:23.747 --> 00:34:26.984
I've tortured and killed
a lot of people in my life.

458
00:34:27.018 --> 00:34:31.688
especially liked killing
those young sorority girls.

459
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:34.557
And I've always
wanted to kill a cop.

460
00:34:36.227 --> 00:34:39.397
Not a fast death.
you understand?

461
00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.767
A slow. agonizing death.

462
00:34:45.002 --> 00:34:47.071
One to remember. huh?

463
00:34:47.104 --> 00:34:52.176
I wanna feel your pain
for the rest of my life.

464
00:34:56.846 --> 00:35:01.851
Maybe if you entertain me.
I'll just permanently disable you. huh?

465
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.029
That's it. decided.

466
00:35:12.063 --> 00:35:15.465
You two will be my first cops.

467
00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:20.537
It's gonna be a fuckin' miracle.

468
00:35:21.172 --> 00:35:22.940
It's gonna be great!

469
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:25.675
I can't wait.

470
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:28.346
Hey. hey. come on. man.

471
00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:30.714
Quit fucking around.

472
00:35:30.747 --> 00:35:33.117
Even you don't
wanna kill two cops.

473
00:35:34.318 --> 00:35:35.819
That's insane.

474
00:35:37.721 --> 00:35:40.690
- Come on. stop.
- Cortez. stop.

475
00:35:40.724 --> 00:35:43.060
- He ain't screwing around.
- Of course he is.

476
00:35:43.094 --> 00:35:47.365
- he's just trying...
- Listen to your friend. bitch!

477
00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:51.869
This ain't no goddamn game...
we're playing.

478
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.547
What the hell just happened?

479
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:07.584
- God. Shut the fuck up.
- No.

480
00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:09.053
He's gonna come back here.

481
00:36:09.086 --> 00:36:11.889
he's gonna torture us
and then he's gonna kill us.

482
00:36:11.922 --> 00:36:14.067
- Do you get the picture?
- No. no. He's not... He's not...

483
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:15.259
He doesn't wanna...

484
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.930
Get this whiney bitch out of
here now.

485
00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:25.702
No. no. Osborn. Osborn!
Stop. please!

486
00:36:25.735 --> 00:36:27.537
McMasters...

487
00:36:28.873 --> 00:36:31.708
If you kill...
If you kill another cop...

488
00:36:32.977 --> 00:36:35.446
they're not gonna
give you anything. Nothing.

489
00:36:35.479 --> 00:36:37.714
Davis! Whitney!

490
00:36:37.747 --> 00:36:39.383
They're gonna fuck you up!

491
00:36:39.417 --> 00:36:41.751
Fucking psycho!

492
00:36:41.785 --> 00:36:43.120
Yeah?

493
00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:45.056
But you know what
they're gonna give you?

494
00:36:46.957 --> 00:36:49.493
You're a fucking psycho!

495
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.732
Captain John Davis.

496
00:36:55.765 --> 00:37:00.104

with the badge of disgrace

497
00:37:00.137 --> 00:37:04.508
'cause you couldn't keep your family
alive when they needed you most!

498
00:37:04.542 --> 00:37:06.310
Shut the fuck up!

499
00:37:06.343 --> 00:37:08.212

Shut the fuck up.

503
00:37:19.622 --> 00:37:22.393
No. you will not

I got some business
to take care of with this bitch.

514
00:39:14.338 --> 00:39:16.040
Not you. bitch.

Pick me up.

520
00:40:01.552 --> 00:40:04.855

521
00:40:04.888 --> 00:40:06.823
Slow. slow. slow.

00:40:06.857 --> 00:40:10.361
Slow down. I'm yours.

523
00:40:10.394 --> 00:40:12.196
You're in charge.

Yes. sir.

527
00:40:38.922 --> 00:40:42.393
Man. I'm getting a piece
of that ass if it kills me.

528
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:46.297
He might kill you. too.

529
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.332
You think
that damn freak McMasters

530
00:40:48.365 --> 00:40:50.501

his piece of ass with you?

531
00:40:50.534 --> 00:40:52.436
Who's fucking you?

532
00:40:55.572 --> 00:40:57.608
I fuck good.
I'm your fucking bitch!

533
00:40:57.641 --> 00:40:59.476
Fuck!

534
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.212
You asshole!

535
00:41:07.518 --> 00:41:08.886
You dumbasses.

536
00:41:08.919 --> 00:41:11.455
McMasters doesn't
give a shit about you.

537
00:41:15.192 --> 00:41:17.761
He's like my brother.
I know he's gonna share with me.

538
00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:19.829
Not a chance. dude.

539
00:41:19.863 --> 00:41:23.133
No man shares his spoils.
No man.

540
00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:26.870
That damn whore
is playin' hard. he's hers.

541
00:41:26.904 --> 00:41:28.572
Listen to that shit.

542
00:41:28.605 --> 00:41:30.374
Slow down. slick.

543
00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:33.444
Take your time. McMasters.

544
00:41:33.477 --> 00:41:36.880
You can fuck me as long
as you want any time you want.

545
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:40.184
But promise.
promise I only fuck you.

546
00:41:40.217 --> 00:41:42.753
- Not the other guys. promise.
- Fuck me.

547
00:41:42.786 --> 00:41:45.189
- Promise you. asshole. promise.
- I promise!

548
00:41:52.396 --> 00:41:55.866
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Wait till I'm up in there.

549
00:41:57.368 --> 00:41:58.969
Yeah. right.

550
00:42:08.112 --> 00:42:10.881
Fuck you. motherfucker.

551
00:42:17.654 --> 00:42:19.858
Oh. yeah.

552
00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.993
- Fuck.
- You're my bitch.

553
00:42:23.026 --> 00:42:25.829
I'm your fucking bitch.

554
00:42:25.864 --> 00:42:27.564
But not others. okay?

555
00:42:27.598 --> 00:42:30.401
No...

556
00:42:30.434 --> 00:42:31.870
I wanna please only you.

557
00:42:31.902 --> 00:42:34.905
Yeah... come on.

558
00:42:35.706 --> 00:42:37.241
I fuck good. right?

559
00:42:37.274 --> 00:42:38.308
You fuck good.

560
00:42:56.326 --> 00:42:57.394
What?

561
00:42:58.429 --> 00:42:59.663
Nothing.

562
00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:03.534
You have something to do. right?

563
00:43:04.568 --> 00:43:05.969
Yeah. man.

564
00:43:12.476 --> 00:43:13.944
Do it.

565
00:43:24.087 --> 00:43:27.224
Got lip...
My lipstick's all over you.

566
00:43:42.306 --> 00:43:43.974
Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat?

567
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.217
Who are you
pointing that gun at?

568
00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:18.235
McMasters.

569
00:45:18.903 --> 00:45:21.071
McMasters. get up!

570
00:45:24.508 --> 00:45:25.542
Hey.

571
00:45:28.078 --> 00:45:31.448
Where is our money?

572
00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:32.583
You...

573
00:45:33.417 --> 00:45:35.053
What'd you just say to me. man?

574
00:45:35.085 --> 00:45:36.787
Take it easy. man.

575
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.322
Calm down.

576
00:45:39.456 --> 00:45:40.824
Take it easy.

577
00:45:40.858 --> 00:45:42.526
Easy. man.

578
00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:50.467
No reason to worry.

579
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.869
What happened?

580
00:46:00.644 --> 00:46:03.948
It's okay. man. don't worry.
Just calm down.

581
00:46:03.982 --> 00:46:05.415
No reason to worry.

582
00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:09.887
Huh?

583
00:47:25.997 --> 00:47:27.230
Kinkaid here.

584
00:47:27.264 --> 00:47:29.332
McMasters.

585
00:47:32.202 --> 00:47:34.271
You got the demands?

586
00:47:35.305 --> 00:47:37.075
They're on their way.

587
00:47:37.108 --> 00:47:40.044
<i>I'm gonna need my medication.</i>

588
00:47:40.078 --> 00:47:42.080
I know.
your meds are on the way.

589
00:47:42.113 --> 00:47:48.452
I need it now...
or everybody is gonna die.

590
00:47:49.219 --> 00:47:50.821
<i>Medication.</i>

591
00:47:51.354 --> 00:47:52.990
My medication.

592
00:47:54.158 --> 00:47:55.392
Now.

593
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:15.612
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll whack himself.

594
00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:19.984
Sounds like he's losing it.

595
00:48:20.017 --> 00:48:24.287
Goddammit. fuck! Shit. fuck!

596
00:48:36.533 --> 00:48:38.602
We're gonna get them all killed.

597
00:48:41.239 --> 00:48:42.539
Don't talk like that.

598
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.995
Come on.

599
00:49:10.634 --> 00:49:11.768
Come on.

600
00:49:30.288 --> 00:49:33.191
What exactly
is your fucking problem?

601
00:49:33.224 --> 00:49:34.926
We gotta move faster.

602
00:49:34.959 --> 00:49:37.862
Snake. I need you
to do negotiations. please.

603
00:49:37.895 --> 00:49:39.030
Yeah.

604
00:49:40.097 --> 00:49:42.166
I'll get us out of here.

605
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.601
- You just...
- No. no. no. no. no.

606
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.471
You don't understand. man.

607
00:49:48.505 --> 00:49:50.875
I gotta get out of here. now.

608
00:49:50.908 --> 00:49:55.612
If I move too fast. we're gonna
end up right back in this fuckin' place.

609
00:49:56.413 --> 00:49:58.381
Just calm down.

610
00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:00.584
I can't stay calm.

611
00:50:22.405 --> 00:50:25.877
I need my medication.

612
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:30.081
I need to get out of here
if I don't have my medication.

613
00:50:30.114 --> 00:50:31.883
I gotta go. now.

614
00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:35.019
You're gonna have to get
your shit under control. man.

615
00:50:35.052 --> 00:50:36.686
I'll get us out of here.

616
00:50:38.122 --> 00:50:39.556
Don't touch me.

617
00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:44.694
I'll get your meds.
you got that?

618
00:50:45.428 --> 00:50:46.596
Now come on.

619
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:47.965
No.

620
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.734
I'm gonna stay here.

621
00:50:58.742 --> 00:51:01.245
There's too many people
out there.

622
00:51:01.279 --> 00:51:03.147
McMasters.

623
00:51:10.121 --> 00:51:11.554
Dammit.

624
00:51:13.991 --> 00:51:15.026
Fuck.

625
00:51:23.334 --> 00:51:25.468
Hey. Raj. leave the bitch alone.

626
00:51:27.104 --> 00:51:28.638
McMasters is sick.
I'm in charge.

627
00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:31.375
- Who said?
- I did.

628
00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:33.443
So you're the one
who's gonna get me my money now?

629
00:51:33.476 --> 00:51:36.813
I'm gonna get the money for us.
not for you. for us.

630
00:51:36.846 --> 00:51:39.783
Get on with it. shit's taken
long enough already.

631
00:51:58.835 --> 00:52:01.838
- Who's this?
- This is Kinkaid.

632
00:52:02.873 --> 00:52:05.076
Can we talk about
how this all got started?

633
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:10.081
I mean. whose idea was it to
rush the bullpen. take hostages?

634
00:52:12.116 --> 00:52:13.284
McMasters?

635
00:52:13.317 --> 00:52:15.585
Kinkaid. this is Snake.

636
00:52:15.618 --> 00:52:18.255
McMasters is sick.
he needs his meds.

637
00:52:18.289 --> 00:52:20.091
<i>He's strugglin'.</i>

638
00:52:20.124 --> 00:52:22.492
<i>I. uh... I was just...</i>

639
00:52:22.525 --> 00:52:24.895
I saw that in his file.

640
00:52:24.929 --> 00:52:27.198
But even if he
took them right now

641
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:29.967
it would take a while for them
to build up in his system.

642
00:52:30.001 --> 00:52:33.104
- You understand?
- I want it now.

643
00:52:33.137 --> 00:52:34.939
How about...

644
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:40.478
How about if we transferred you
to a minimum security prison.

645
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.778
would that help things along?

646
00:52:41.811 --> 00:52:43.147
Transfer?

647
00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.548
He'd never go for transfer.

648
00:52:45.582 --> 00:52:48.618
We want money
and safe passage in Mexico.

649
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:52.555
$4 million.
a helicopter. Mexico.

650
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:57.594
I could promise you
that I would do my best.

651
00:52:57.627 --> 00:52:59.864
But you know
that's not gonna happen. right?

652
00:52:59.897 --> 00:53:01.432
Man. you don't got much time.

653
00:53:01.465 --> 00:53:03.467
I'm not asking you
to sell out your friends.

654
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:06.137
I know you're not
that kind of guy.

655
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.840
But Raj and McMasters.

656
00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:13.411
<i>they're a whole another story.</i>

657
00:53:13.444 --> 00:53:15.645
<i>Before you say anything.</i>

658
00:53:15.678 --> 00:53:18.115
<i>I'd like to tell you
something man to man.</i>

659
00:53:18.149 --> 00:53:23.220
I'm so glad that you've
taken over the situation.

660
00:53:23.254 --> 00:53:27.324
I mean. you're the only
rational mind in the room.

661
00:53:27.358 --> 00:53:29.026
you know what I mean?

662
00:53:30.194 --> 00:53:31.694
And I'll make you this promise.

663
00:53:31.728 --> 00:53:35.933
I will get you those meds
as soon as possible.

664
00:53:36.867 --> 00:53:38.302
Okay?

665
00:53:38.335 --> 00:53:40.004
Hurry up. please.

666
00:53:43.507 --> 00:53:44.542
That's a win.

667
00:53:44.574 --> 00:53:46.676
Huge win.

668
00:53:53.084 --> 00:53:55.352
Raj. go check on
that son of a bitch.

669
00:53:55.386 --> 00:53:57.754
- He's flipping out in there.
- Why don't you do it?

670
00:53:57.787 --> 00:54:01.791
'Cause I said for you to.
Do you understand me?

671
00:54:03.094 --> 00:54:04.727
Damn bullshit.

672
00:54:04.761 --> 00:54:06.763
It's just starting right now.

673
00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:22.679
McMasters.

674
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:26.417
McMasters.

675
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:28.219
- You okay?
- Who are you?

676
00:54:29.153 --> 00:54:30.787
Raj.

677
00:54:32.256 --> 00:54:34.724
- Who?
- Raj. man.

678
00:54:34.757 --> 00:54:37.727
- You all right?
- You got my meds?

679
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.662
We're working on it.
just give it a beat.

680
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:41.565
- We're working on it.
- Give me my meds. man.

681
00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:43.968
Put the gun down. man.
Chill out. dude.

682
00:54:44.001 --> 00:54:45.912
- Give me my fucking meds.
- We're working on the meds.

683
00:54:45.936 --> 00:54:48.139
Put the fucking gun down. man.

684
00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:11.929
Who gave you the authority
to promise him meds?

685
00:55:11.962 --> 00:55:14.398
What the hell do you
think you're doing. Kinkaid?

686
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:16.634
I'm trying to stop a bloodbath.

687
00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:20.271
Kinkaid's taking over
the negotiations.

688
00:55:20.304 --> 00:55:23.207
Let's just get these meds
ready for delivery.

689
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:28.012
No. There will be
no meds delivered.

690
00:55:28.045 --> 00:55:31.549
Do you understand the extent
of the situation over there?

691
00:55:31.582 --> 00:55:33.584
Nothing will be
given to that group

692
00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:35.752
without concessions
on their part.

693
00:55:35.785 --> 00:55:41.091
If McMasters goes psychotic. there'll
be no negotiations just an aftermath.

694
00:55:41.125 --> 00:55:44.061
My position
is not up for debate.

695
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:47.264
From here on out.

696
00:55:47.298 --> 00:55:49.533
this situation will be
handled by the book.

697
00:55:49.567 --> 00:55:51.768
No concessions.

698
00:56:05.382 --> 00:56:06.716
Snake.

699
00:56:09.687 --> 00:56:14.892
Look. I know you and McMasters
go back a long ways.

700
00:56:15.993 --> 00:56:19.697
That dude's lost it
and that's a big problem.

701
00:56:19.729 --> 00:56:23.701
But Kinkaid said he's gonna get the
meds. I know he's gonna come through.

702
00:56:23.733 --> 00:56:26.170
Yeah. well he better
and quickly.

703
00:56:26.203 --> 00:56:28.738
Otherwise we're gonna have to
take out that damn freak ourselves.

704
00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:30.840
You saw how he
pulled his guns on us.

705
00:56:30.874 --> 00:56:33.978
What the fuck are you afraid of?
You've got a gun. too.

706
00:56:34.912 --> 00:56:36.580
Get in there and watch him.

707
00:56:36.614 --> 00:56:38.983
Just don't fucking kill him.

708
00:56:39.016 --> 00:56:43.020
You wanna take all the fun
out of this for me. huh?

709
00:56:43.053 --> 00:56:46.190
Look. I don't give a shit.

710
00:56:46.223 --> 00:56:49.759
I'm not sure which one
of you assholes scares me more.

711
00:57:07.978 --> 00:57:09.647
Just hang in there. Cherry.

712
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.982
They're gonna get us
out of here. I promise.

713
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:15.785
I'll be dead by then.

714
00:57:15.818 --> 00:57:17.721
No. you won't.

715
00:57:17.755 --> 00:57:20.257
Just hang in there.
just a little longer.

716
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.026
It'll be over soon.

717
00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:24.161
Think about your daughter.

718
00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:28.065
I am. but I'm not sure
I can get out of this.

719
00:57:28.098 --> 00:57:31.769
Please. and I'll be
any good for anyone.

720
00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:36.340
Just a little longer.
It'll be over soon.

721
00:57:38.676 --> 00:57:40.678
Davis. can you see it?

722
00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:42.913
They're screwing
this whole thing up.

723
00:57:42.946 --> 00:57:45.115
They're gonna get us killed.

724
00:58:00.297 --> 00:58:03.067
What you're proposing
is gonna get people killed.

725
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.601
It's gonna get cops killed.

726
00:58:04.635 --> 00:58:07.938
And I don't think it's legal
to withhold meds from this man.

727
00:58:07.971 --> 00:58:10.774
Is that how you feel also?

728
00:58:10.808 --> 00:58:14.678
Rodriguez. mistakes were made.

729
00:58:14.712 --> 00:58:16.313
It happens in a negotiation.

730
00:58:16.347 --> 00:58:18.749
It's the nature of the game.
come on.

731
00:58:18.782 --> 00:58:21.151
Nothing will be
sent to that bullpen.

732
00:58:21.185 --> 00:58:24.988
No more food. no water. Nothing.

733
00:58:25.022 --> 00:58:31.295
And there will be no more communication
with that bullpen until they call us.

734
00:58:31.328 --> 00:58:35.065
Your hard line approach
is gonna blow up in our faces.

735
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:03.293
What's so damn funny?

736
00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:06.163
What's funny?

737
00:59:06.196 --> 00:59:08.565
Your so called leader
is back there losing it.

738
00:59:08.599 --> 00:59:13.103
He's gonna get you both killed
or kill you both himself.

739
00:59:15.272 --> 00:59:16.774
Shut up!

740
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.290
Fuck! Fuck!

741
01:00:10.828 --> 01:00:12.796
Fuck. man.

742
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.498
I need to get control.

743
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.836
I have to take control
of the situation.

744
01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:29.546
Fuck.

745
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:33.350
Fuck.

746
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:09.988
Snake. may I talk to you?

747
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.021
What do you want?

748
01:01:11.054 --> 01:01:12.489
It's about Davis.

749
01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:16.560
He's in a very bad shape.
He's unconscious.

750
01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:19.964
- Are you fucking with me?
- No. no. I swear.

751
01:01:19.998 --> 01:01:22.699
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

752
01:01:25.168 --> 01:01:28.539
- Please help.
- I'll take care of this.

753
01:01:28.572 --> 01:01:30.207
Thank you.

754
01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:54.999
Snake. this is Rodriguez.

755
01:01:55.033 --> 01:01:58.669
<i>Who is this?
Every time I call it's a new bullshitter.</i>

756
01:01:58.702 --> 01:02:00.203
What can I do for you. Snake?

757
01:02:00.237 --> 01:02:02.406
I asked for some meds.

758
01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:06.209
And I gotta tell you one of
your hostages is in bad shape.

759
01:02:11.715 --> 01:02:14.318
So are you offering me
Captain Davis for the meds?

760
01:02:14.351 --> 01:02:17.454
No. I'm just
giving you information.

761
01:02:18.856 --> 01:02:21.291
Well. if you want the meds.

762
01:02:21.325 --> 01:02:23.160
you're gonna have to
give us the captain.

763
01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:26.663
I don't give a damn
about the meds.

764
01:02:26.697 --> 01:02:31.268
The captain on the other hand.
you want him. make an offer.

765
01:02:32.669 --> 01:02:34.805
I don't give a fuck
if he dies or not.

766
01:02:36.406 --> 01:02:40.577
Well. Snake. you do know
that it's murder?

767
01:02:40.611 --> 01:02:43.647
Look. dumb-ass. who do you
think you're dealing with?

768
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.651
We're facing life no matter what
happens if we ever get out of here.

769
01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:51.822
Let me call you back. Snake.

770
01:02:51.856 --> 01:02:53.624
Suit yourself.

771
01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:03.333
What are you
gonna offer him now?

772
01:03:05.268 --> 01:03:07.237
The meds for the captain.

773
01:03:08.739 --> 01:03:11.742
You know the difference
between you and Kinkaid?

774
01:03:11.775 --> 01:03:13.310
Hm?

775
01:03:13.343 --> 01:03:16.948
Kinkaid recognized that he
underestimated that asshole.

776
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.749
He actually gave a damn.

777
01:03:18.782 --> 01:03:21.818
You're too arrogant to recognize
or care about anything.

778
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.756
I can have you removed.

779
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:27.925
You have no authority over me.

780
01:03:27.959 --> 01:03:30.460
You have no authority over me!

781
01:03:31.395 --> 01:03:33.965
I'm losing. I'm losing.

782
01:03:33.998 --> 01:03:37.200
If there is a God
I will believe in you.

783
01:03:37.234 --> 01:03:41.271
Please send me magic and power.
Get me out of here.

784
01:03:41.304 --> 01:03:43.640
Please. Please.

785
01:03:58.288 --> 01:04:01.458
Snake. may I go to the bathroom?

786
01:04:04.996 --> 01:04:06.030
Yeah.

787
01:04:06.064 --> 01:04:08.598
- Come with me.
- Okay.

788
01:04:12.636 --> 01:04:14.838
Please... Please. don't hurt me.

789
01:04:14.872 --> 01:04:16.908
Don't hurt me.

790
01:04:18.308 --> 01:04:21.411
Save that bullshit
for McMasters.

791
01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:23.014
I don't wanna hurt you.

792
01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:24.982
I don't wanna fuck you.

793
01:04:25.016 --> 01:04:28.152
Torture. pain.

794
01:04:28.186 --> 01:04:31.722
That's what I want.
That's what I need.

795
01:04:35.126 --> 01:04:37.095
Relax. I'm not going anywhere.

796
01:04:37.128 --> 01:04:38.762
I'm not.

797
01:04:40.164 --> 01:04:42.532
You know what your problem is?

798
01:04:42.566 --> 01:04:45.469
You try so hard to be in control
but you're not in control.

799
01:04:45.502 --> 01:04:50.540
Let me tell you this.
I'm a fucking whore.

800
01:04:50.574 --> 01:04:53.677
If I fuck one more man.
doesn't make any difference.

801
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:57.014
But it will make difference
for you. remember that.

802
01:04:57.048 --> 01:04:59.217
If you fuck me right now.

803
01:04:59.249 --> 01:05:03.855
you lose control over me
and get fucking punished.

804
01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:19.636
I'm done with you.

805
01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:49.000
What are you doing?

806
01:05:49.766 --> 01:05:52.569
Get out there. now!

807
01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:15.358
Who's this?

808
01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:17.360
This is Rodriguez.

809
01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:18.695
I'm calling to make an offer.

810
01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:20.932
Look. I wanna talk to Kinkaid.

811
01:06:20.965 --> 01:06:22.632
Kinkaid here.

812
01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:25.937
I've got somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

813
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:27.104
Hold on.

814
01:06:34.245 --> 01:06:37.114
<i>Is this FBI Agent Kinkaid?</i>

815
01:06:38.316 --> 01:06:40.517
Yes. this is Kinkaid.
Who is this?

816
01:06:41.852 --> 01:06:43.787
Nice to hear your voice.

817
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.223
It's Cherry.

818
01:06:45.256 --> 01:06:47.892
I wanna talk to you about Davis.
the captain.

819
01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:49.559
I'm listening.

820
01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:52.230
<i>I think he'll die if he
doesn't go to see a doctor.</i>

821
01:06:52.263 --> 01:06:56.633
And he's breathing very poor

822
01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:59.937
and right now
he's suddenly unconscious.

823
01:07:01.605 --> 01:07:04.876
Cherry. how are you?
Have they hurt you?

824
01:07:04.909 --> 01:07:08.079
I'm... I'm. uh...

825
01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:13.918
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

826
01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:23.793
So what's your offer?

827
01:07:24.694 --> 01:07:25.829
So. Snake.

828
01:07:25.863 --> 01:07:30.334
the offer is
meds for the captain.

829
01:07:30.368 --> 01:07:32.569
Look. this is how it is.

830
01:07:32.602 --> 01:07:36.240
In an hour I give Davis to Raj
to use as a toy.

831
01:07:36.274 --> 01:07:37.975
Then I give Cherry to McMasters.

832
01:07:38.009 --> 01:07:41.845
Now I want those meds and food.
then we'll talk.

833
01:07:52.056 --> 01:07:54.125
I had a rapport with Snake.

834
01:07:55.927 --> 01:07:57.527
Good job.

835
01:09:20.878 --> 01:09:23.613
It's been a few minutes
since the food was delivered.

836
01:09:23.646 --> 01:09:25.182
You wanna check in now?

837
01:09:26.217 --> 01:09:29.753
Uh... Yeah.

838
01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:41.032
- Who is it this time?
<i>- Snake. it's Kinkaid.</i>

839
01:09:42.133 --> 01:09:43.566
The food okay?

840
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.169
Yeah. man. it's good.

841
01:09:45.202 --> 01:09:51.208
Now. I-I sent you. uh.
a gesture of good faith.

842
01:09:51.242 --> 01:09:52.776
<i>Yeah. what is it?</i>

843
01:09:53.477 --> 01:09:55.079
Meds for McMasters.

844
01:09:55.112 --> 01:09:58.648
<i>It's in one
of the food containers.</i>

845
01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:01.485
Hey. Kinkaid. I appreciate it.
Thanks. man.

846
01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:03.888
All right. now listen. uh.

847
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:07.258
you give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

848
01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:09.126
<i>Yeah. I'll do that.</i>

849
01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:23.074
Chris. could we put together
a list of potential prisons

850
01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:25.242
that we could
transfer these guys to?

851
01:10:25.276 --> 01:10:27.677
Sure. I can do that.

852
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.915
McMasters is gonna be
especially difficult though.

853
01:10:32.582 --> 01:10:37.687
You know. I must admit.
Snakes' demeanor changed.

854
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.192
But those meds were
our biggest bargaining chip.

855
01:10:41.225 --> 01:10:42.460
And now they're gone.

856
01:10:42.493 --> 01:10:46.696
I think the bigger question
is did we get it to him in time?

857
01:10:47.465 --> 01:10:49.666
Yeah.

858
01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:52.536
Kinkaid said they put a
tranquilizer in a food container.

859
01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:54.105
Did we throw that shit away?

860
01:10:54.138 --> 01:10:55.605
Yeah.

861
01:11:03.646 --> 01:11:05.282
Ah. shit.

862
01:11:17.094 --> 01:11:19.597
Man. there's only one in here.

863
01:11:19.629 --> 01:11:21.398
I hope this shit works.

864
01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:23.267
Damn straight.

865
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.568
Look. I ain't scared of much.

866
01:11:24.602 --> 01:11:27.505
but that son of a bitch
scares the shit out of me.

867
01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:29.373
When are we gettin' to Mexico?

868
01:11:29.406 --> 01:11:32.076
Soon. Very soon.

869
01:11:45.089 --> 01:11:46.590
<i>You got Kinkaid.</i>

870
01:11:46.624 --> 01:11:48.159
Hey. Kinkaid. listen. uh.

871
01:11:48.192 --> 01:11:50.561
I need to get Davis
out of here to a doctor.

872
01:11:50.594 --> 01:11:52.563
Man. I got two problems though.

873
01:11:52.596 --> 01:11:54.031
<i>What are the problems?</i>

874
01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:56.666
Look. these two think
we're headed to Mexico.

875
01:11:56.699 --> 01:12:01.338
And if I give up Davis.
they're gonna want answers.

876
01:12:01.372 --> 01:12:03.806
- <i>Are they armed?</i>
- Yes.

877
01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:07.178
<i>Snake. this is the deal:</i>

878
01:12:08.778 --> 01:12:12.183
<i>I can get you into
a minimum security prison.</i>

879
01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:16.554
<i>Will Raj go for the same deal?</i>

880
01:12:16.587 --> 01:12:19.156
Man. if he doesn't
I'm gonna have to kill him.

881
01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:23.527
I have no idea what I'm gonna be
dealing with once McMasters wakes up.

882
01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:27.398
<i>There's nothing I can do with
McMasters. No one will take him.</i>

883
01:12:29.366 --> 01:12:31.902
<i>Now. you give me. Davis.</i>

884
01:12:31.936 --> 01:12:36.307
<i>and I'll get you and Raj
into minimum security prisons.</i>

885
01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.341
<i>That's the deal.</i>

886
01:12:37.374 --> 01:12:40.177
<i>But you've got to
convince Raj. okay?</i>

887
01:12:40.211 --> 01:12:42.779
Yeah. that sounds good.

888
01:12:56.961 --> 01:12:59.029
I'm worried about Snake.

889
01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:02.967
He's the most rational
of the three. but...

890
01:13:04.935 --> 01:13:07.671
he sounded scared of Raj.

891
01:13:07.705 --> 01:13:11.075
I just wonder
how persuasive Snake can be.

892
01:13:23.153 --> 01:13:26.557
You said we'd be out of this
shit hole and in Mexico by now.

893
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.792
That was the motherfucking deal.
period.

894
01:13:30.793 --> 01:13:34.797
Between him
and the two cops we killed.

895
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:36.766
this deal went south.

896
01:13:36.799 --> 01:13:39.570
So the plan's changed now. huh?

897
01:13:39.603 --> 01:13:43.340
It's because of you and
McMasters that this deal's dead.

898
01:13:43.374 --> 01:13:47.044
You know what.
fuck the cops. fuck McMasters.

899
01:13:47.077 --> 01:13:50.481
Why did the plan change. huh?
Was it because of that whore?

900
01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:53.417
Mesmerized her with your voodoo
like she did him?

901
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.851
Let me tell you something.

902
01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:57.921
If I go to prison.
that bitch dies.

903
01:13:57.955 --> 01:14:02.026
Raj. minimum security prison.

904
01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:04.728
It's a fucking country club.
that's what our offer is.

905
01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:06.664
It's life. Snake.

906
01:14:06.697 --> 01:14:09.533
We'll still be
in prison for life.

907
01:14:09.566 --> 01:14:12.835
You guys have life.
I had short time.

908
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.339
- You guys had life.
- Yeah. I had life.

909
01:14:15.372 --> 01:14:17.541
That's why I listened
to you and McMasters.

910
01:14:17.574 --> 01:14:19.410
We're supposed to be in Mexico.

911
01:14:19.443 --> 01:14:23.213
You know what. I think
I can make it still. too.

912
01:14:23.247 --> 01:14:27.217
No. we can't make it. It's over.

913
01:14:28.619 --> 01:14:31.655
Yeah. we can't. Snake.

914
01:14:31.689 --> 01:14:34.658
I... I'm gonna make it.

915
01:14:34.692 --> 01:14:37.061
And the Princess
is going with me.

916
01:14:37.094 --> 01:14:42.032
Look. man. we're lucky Davis
is still alive.

917
01:14:42.066 --> 01:14:45.269
Without that bitch.
I got no power left.

918
01:14:45.302 --> 01:14:48.972
Well. I guess
you're fucked then. ain't you?

919
01:14:49.006 --> 01:14:51.275
You know what. I'm in charge.

920
01:14:53.177 --> 01:14:56.347
You and McMasters
can leave whenever you want.

921
01:14:57.214 --> 01:14:58.682
Bitch is mine.

922
01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:36.887
Snake. did you
work things out with Raj?

923
01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.989
Yeah. we talked.

924
01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:41.425
<i>And the answer's
go fuck yourself.</i>

925
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.130
Snake and McMasters
can leave whenever they want.

926
01:15:46.163 --> 01:15:49.366
The bitch and I want
a helicopter on out of here.

927
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:58.609
Raj. I can't get you
a helicopter.

928
01:16:00.244 --> 01:16:02.546
<i>Only the governor
can approve that.</i>

929
01:16:03.947 --> 01:16:07.151
All right. have it your way.

930
01:16:07.184 --> 01:16:09.653
<i>You know.
I've been wanting to die.</i>

931
01:16:09.686 --> 01:16:11.388
<i>Maybe tonight's the night.</i>

932
01:16:11.422 --> 01:16:15.592
But the bitch goes with me
and that's on your ass.

933
01:16:27.304 --> 01:16:29.006
Oh. God.

934
01:16:32.142 --> 01:16:34.578
So what exactly did he say?

935
01:16:36.814 --> 01:16:40.484
He said he can't
authorize a chopper.

936
01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:43.454
So you say you're gonna
kill yourself and the bitch.

937
01:16:43.487 --> 01:16:47.825
Yeah. and I mean to do it.

938
01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:49.326
So I'm fucked?

939
01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:51.094
I need the bitch
for my transfer.

940
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:53.664
Well. that's not my
fucking problem now. is it?

941
01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:55.199
Why do you wanna kill me?

942
01:16:55.232 --> 01:16:56.967
I didn't do anything wrong.

943
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.736
I have a daughter. She needs me.

944
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:01.572
Do you have a fucking heart?

945
01:17:01.605 --> 01:17:04.107
I don't want to die.

946
01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:07.912
If I have to pay.
they have to pay.

947
01:17:07.946 --> 01:17:11.648
And you have to pay.
That's just how it works.

948
01:17:11.682 --> 01:17:13.584
Okay. then.

949
01:17:13.617 --> 01:17:17.421
Then may I talk to my daughter
for the one last time?

950
01:17:18.655 --> 01:17:22.861
Snake. can I speak to
my daughter one last time?

951
01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:25.496
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.

952
01:17:28.499 --> 01:17:31.502
You can play up
those tears all you want.

953
01:17:31.535 --> 01:17:33.237
but I know the truth.

954
01:17:33.837 --> 01:17:34.939
What truth?

955
01:17:34.973 --> 01:17:36.707
The truth about you and Snake.

956
01:17:37.808 --> 01:17:39.042
What about us?

957
01:17:39.076 --> 01:17:41.745
You're crazy. there's nothing...
Fucking truth.

958
01:17:41.778 --> 01:17:43.347
There's no fucking truth
between us.

959
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.182
I'm just trying to stay alive.

960
01:17:45.215 --> 01:17:47.384
I'll do anything
to achieve that.

961
01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:49.753
Do you understand. motherfucker?

962
01:17:49.786 --> 01:17:50.955
- Shut up!
- Okay.

963
01:17:50.989 --> 01:17:53.156
Another truth. Raj.

964
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:57.394
The truth about your sorry ass.

965
01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:02.799
You want to talk about that?

966
01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:04.201
You want to talk about that?

967
01:18:04.234 --> 01:18:07.371
Shut up. bitch.
or I'll kill you right now.

968
01:18:07.404 --> 01:18:10.073
Go ahead. kill me.
I'm already dead.

969
01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:15.178
But before that. let's discuss
the truth about you.

970
01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:17.949
how you murdered a woman
because you can't get up for one.

971
01:18:17.982 --> 01:18:24.154
A prison turned her into a
fucking asshole for old real men.

972
01:18:24.187 --> 01:18:26.623
You lying whore.

973
01:18:26.657 --> 01:18:29.359
You're never gonna see
your daughter again.

974
01:18:29.393 --> 01:18:31.662
- We'll see about that.
- Shut up.

975
01:18:31.695 --> 01:18:34.665
I need to call Kinkaid
and make a deal for myself.

976
01:18:34.698 --> 01:18:37.834
You're on your own
and stay the fuck away from me.

977
01:18:48.612 --> 01:18:50.847
Hello. Snake?

978
01:18:50.882 --> 01:18:53.216
<i>I wanna talk to Kinkaid.</i>

979
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.152
Kinkaid's not here.

980
01:18:55.185 --> 01:18:57.187
He's trying to find a way
to help out your friend.

981
01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.323
Fuck him. He's not my friend.

982
01:18:59.356 --> 01:19:01.025
I just want my fucking deal.

983
01:19:01.059 --> 01:19:03.895
Okay. I promise. I'll tell them.

984
01:19:03.928 --> 01:19:07.364
It may take a bit because he's
talking to the powers that be. okay?

985
01:19:07.397 --> 01:19:11.002
Look. if we leave now
is my deal still intact?

986
01:19:11.035 --> 01:19:13.537
Snake. it's Kinkaid.

987
01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:18.042
Snake. your deal is in place
but I need your help.

988
01:19:18.076 --> 01:19:20.878
You can't let Cherry
go with Raj.

989
01:19:20.912 --> 01:19:22.813
You got my word.

990
01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:26.617
Okay. and you've got mine.

991
01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:32.255
So that's your plan?
Trusting a guy named Snake?

992
01:19:45.802 --> 01:19:47.738
The fuck you looking at?

993
01:19:49.706 --> 01:19:51.241
What did you say?

994
01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:57.115
I said you're a bitch.

995
01:19:58.649 --> 01:19:59.783
Oh. that hurt.

996
01:19:59.816 --> 01:20:02.686
- Say something else.
- That's all you got?

997
01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:17.035
The girl was right.
you're dickless.

998
01:20:31.949 --> 01:20:33.483
Shit.

999
01:20:43.961 --> 01:20:45.729
See you in hell.

1000
01:21:01.745 --> 01:21:03.346
Get on this desk.

1001
01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.983
Listen to me. listen to me.

1002
01:21:06.017 --> 01:21:08.752
What do you want?
What do you want?

1003
01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:12.756
I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax.

1004
01:21:29.806 --> 01:21:30.908
Okay.

1005
01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:33.945
What's wrong?

1006
01:21:34.711 --> 01:21:36.513
You fucked me good.

1007
01:21:38.082 --> 01:21:41.185
I need you
to fuck me one more time

1008
01:21:41.219 --> 01:21:43.653
and then kill me. okay?

1009
01:21:43.687 --> 01:21:44.856
You kill me.

1010
01:21:56.934 --> 01:21:59.536
Don't do that.
don't do that. don't do that.

1011
01:22:02.839 --> 01:22:05.709
Stop. stop. Stop.

1012
01:22:07.544 --> 01:22:09.679
You said I fuck good.

1013
01:22:09.713 --> 01:22:16.888
but I'm gonna show you
I fuck even better with a gun.

1014
01:22:34.005 --> 01:22:35.039
Snake!

1015
01:22:36.274 --> 01:22:38.341
The hell's going on here. man?

1016
01:22:42.312 --> 01:22:44.481
I think he
just killed the bitch.

1017
01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:07.404
Get down on your knees.

1018
01:23:08.705 --> 01:23:10.875
I said get down on your knees!

1019
01:23:20.985 --> 01:23:23.888
Worthless piece of shit!

1020
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:25.056
Think you're in control?

1021
01:23:26.123 --> 01:23:28.491
This is for my daughter.

1022
01:23:42.206 --> 01:23:44.474
So you're gonna
kill me too. bitch?

1023
01:23:49.846 --> 01:23:53.918
Now it is my turn.

1024
01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:55.685
fucking asshole.

1025
01:23:57.088 --> 01:23:59.156
Well. my. my. my.

1026
01:24:24.447 --> 01:24:26.017
Who are you?

1027
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.550
Cherry.

1028
01:24:29.186 --> 01:24:32.555
It's Kinkaid. FBI.

1029
01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.724
We spoke. remember?

1030
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.628
Yes. Yes.

1031
01:24:41.165 --> 01:24:42.465
Clear.

1032
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:47.637
What a mess.

1033
01:24:56.513 --> 01:24:59.716
Here we go. here we go.
Here we go.

1034
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:03.421
You're okay now. You're safe.

1035
01:25:13.763 --> 01:25:16.934
It's over. okay. It's over.
