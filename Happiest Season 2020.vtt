Okay.

1885
01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.730
Okay.

1886
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.810
Come on.

1887
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.730
ABBY:
My parents loved Christmas.

1888
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.150
We would do all the stuff.

1889
01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:45.450
We would decorate and...

1890
01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:47.870
do the tree and watch. like.
every Christmas movie.

1891
01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:56.210
After they died. I‐I couldn't really
bring myself to acknowledge Christmas.

1892
01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.750
JOHN:
Hmm.

1893
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:03.300
‐ The holidays were just
a huge reminder of...

1894
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.840
them not being here.

1895
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.300
So I really thought
maybe this year with...

1896
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.890
with Harper and meeting
her family. you know.

1897
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:16.770
that it would just feel different.

1898

[ sniffles ]

1899
01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.570
I don't‐‐ I don't think that she...

1900
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:29.570
loves me as much as I thought she did.

1901
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:31.240
‐ Hey.

1902
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:37.330
Harper not coming out to her parents
has nothing to do with you.

1903
01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:40.330
‐ [ trembling ] How could it not?

1904
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:46.090
‐ Remind me. what did your parents say
when you told them you were gay?

1905
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.180
‐ Um. that they loved and supported me.

1906
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.560
‐ That's amazing.

1907
01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.400
My dad...

1908
01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.230
kicked me out of the house

1909
01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:04.940
and didn't talk to me
for 13 years after I told him.

1910
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.280
Everybody's story is different.

1911
01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.950
There's your version

1912
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:17.000
and my version and everything in between.

1913
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:22.920
But the one thing that
all of those stories have in common

1914
01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.420
is that moment
right before you say those words.

1915
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.510
when your heart is racing

1916
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:32.800
and you don't know what's coming next.

1917
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.770
That moment's really terrifying.

1918
01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.600
And then once you say those words.

1919
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.020
you can't unsay them.

1920
01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.400
A chapter has ended.
and a new one's begun.

1921
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.570
and you have to be ready for that.

1922
01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:54.780
You can't do it for anyone else.

1923
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.620
Just because Harper isn't ready.

1924
01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.170
it doesn't mean she never will be.

1925
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:04.080
and it doesn't mean she doesn't love you.

‐ Mm.

1930
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:30.570
You look great in this coat.

Just wait for me in the car.

Great party.

‐ Merry Christmas.

‐ She's a really good one.

‐ [ chuckles ] Yeah.

Okay. come on. Let's get you two to bed.

‐ I'll call you.

1949

‐ What the hell happened tonight?

1950
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.950
Even as children.
you never behaved this badly.

1951
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:57.870
I expected more from you.
especially you. Harper.

1952
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:59.910
You know how this world works.

1953
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:04.330
Reputation is everything.
and tonight you jeopardized mine.

1954
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.170
Jane. I know you‐you just
wanted to be included.

1955
01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:08.460
‐ It was really nice.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.420
‐ Sloane. making up lies
about your sister.

1957

You're better than that.

At least you used to be.

1963
01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.150

I'm gay.

And I am in love with Abby.

1966
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.950
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys sooner.

1967
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:47.500
but I know how much appearances
and reputation matter to you.

1968
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.790

But I...

01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.340
let myself hurt Riley...

1972
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.140
...because I was so scared
that you would find out

1973
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.390
I wasn't who you wanted me to be.

1974
01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.270
And...

1975
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.860
I still regret it.

1976
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:17.860
I can't do that to Abby... [ chuckles ]

So I am done being scared.

1980

We separated a few months ago.

1984

And the truth is I didn't tell you

1985
01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.210
because without my family
I'm worthless to you.

1986
