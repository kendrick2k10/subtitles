(ominous music)

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.917
(birds chirping)

6
00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:58.243
- I'm wondering if the President's aware

7
00:00:58.243 --> 00:01:00.770
of this phenomenon and if the White House

8
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.420
wants to say anything to
discourage these types of crimes.

9
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.819
- I don't know that the
President has been briefed

10
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.270
on this particular situation.

11
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.413
This is something that I've read about

12
00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:11.003
in some of the news coverage.

13
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.100
Obviously. you know. this was a situation

14
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.410
that local law enforcement
authorities take quite seriously

15
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.464
and they should carefully
and thoroughly review

16
00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:26.443
perceived threats to the
safety of the community.

17
00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:36.751
- There's someone out there.

18
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:38.334
- You saw it?
- Yes!

19
00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:48.789
- [Man] Hello?

20
00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:53.033
Clown?

21
00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:58.033
(feet running)
(girl screaming)

22
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.323
Hey!

23
00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:05.485
Hey!

24
00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:18.443
Oh my God. oh my God.

25
00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:21.526
Oh my God. Emily. Emily. what. Emily?

26
00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:25.571
Where are you?

27
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:27.321
Emily. where are you?

28
00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:32.441
Emily. oh my God. oh my God.
oh my God. Emily. Emily!

29
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:35.024
Oh Emily. oh my God. oh my God.

Help!

31
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.671
Oh my God. oh my God.

32
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:50.004
(screaming)

33
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.286
No. no. oh my God. oh my God!

34
00:02:58.297 --> 00:02:59.130
No!

35
00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:04.712
Help. somebody help me!

36
00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:08.025
Help!

37
00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:10.825
Help!

38
00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.616
Somebody help me!

39
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.322
Scott. Scott!

40
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.786
Oh my God. Scott. help!

41
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.105
Somebody. somebody help me. Scott!

42
00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:29.938
Scott. no!

43
00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.531
Help!

44
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.020
(smashing)

45
00:03:42.978 --> 00:03:45.784
(tense music)

46
00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:46.784
- [Man] Hey!

47
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.852
Hey. what the hell?

48
00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:53.415
What are you doing?

49
00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:54.864
The fuck. man!

50
00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:56.196
Get off me!

51
00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:57.029
Get!

52
00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:59.687
(man screaming)

53
00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.937
(punching)

54
00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:11.435
- [Woman] I think it's on the right.

55
00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:13.185
- [Man] On the right.

56
00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.723
How long has it been
since you've been here?

57
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.110
- [Woman] Probably about 10 years.

58
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.543
- 10 years?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.190
- [Man] Fuck. is it always
this fucking quiet out here?

60
00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.284
- [Woman] Kinda.

61
00:04:39.157 --> 00:04:40.194
- [Man] You okay?

62
00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:42.890
- [Woman] Yeah. thanks for coming with me.

63
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.723
- [Man] Sure.

64
00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:46.565
- [Woman] Okay.

65
00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:52.383
(car beeping)

66
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.090
Can you hold it?

67
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.303
- [Man] Yeah. I got it.

68
00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.150
(chainsaw revving)

69
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.165
- Holy shit!
- Is this a joke?

70
00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:08.913
- [Woman] Holy shit. holy shit.

71
00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:10.580
- [Man] Run. go. go!

72
00:05:11.586 --> 00:05:13.861
(woman screaming)

73
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:14.694
Shit!

74
00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:19.092
(shouting)

75
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.621
Run Cindy. run!

76
00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:28.864
(Cindy sobbing)

77
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:35.284
- Shit. shit.

78
00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:42.342
911. yes. help me. emergency.

79
00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:45.001
Thank God. thank God.

80
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.668
(ominous music)

81
00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:50.670
Yes!

82
00:05:51.573 --> 00:05:54.406
(Cindy screaming)

83
00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:22.224
(static buzzing)

84
00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.740
- What are you doing?

85
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.780
- [Jessica] I have a surprise for you.

86
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.216
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:07:03.216 --> 00:07:04.813
- What's that?
- Look right there?

88
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.120
- What do we got here?

89
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.093
I like the pink wrapping.

90
00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:10.303
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.

91
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.143
Ooh.

92
00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.710
This is like a legit Hollywood slate.

93
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.053
- Mm-hmm.
- Behind the Sightings.

94
00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:23.890
That's that clown documentary. right?

95
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.640
- Yep.
- Oh my gosh. look at this.

96
00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:27.940
(slate clapping)

97
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.653
Wait. you do after. you do it after right?

98
00:07:29.653 --> 00:07:31.712
- Yeah. I think so.
- Okay.

99
00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:34.453
Beyond the sightings. take one.

100
00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.230
- [Jessica] Very serious.
very director like. I love it.

101
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.950
- Yeah. Todd Smith. director. camera two.

102
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.610
But there's only one camera.

103
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.140
- [Jessica] Not anymore.
my mom gave me the money.

104
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.613
We can do our movie!

105
00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:49.794
- Oh my gosh.
- Come check it out.

106
00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:51.644
- You're amazing.
- It's right here.

107
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.674
- Look at that. you!

108
00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.860
(kissing)

109
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.790
You are so freaking amazing.

110
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.803
And your Mom.

112
00:08:01.803 --> 00:08:03.912
This is freaking awesome.
- I know.

113
00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.930
- Let's do it. you wanna go?

114
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.763
- What. like right now?

115
00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:08.680
- Yeah. let's take out this thing.

116
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.340
We gotta go and try it out.

117
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.481
- Well. I was thinking of
something else for today.

118
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.681
- What's going on?
- We can start tomorrow.

119
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.624
I have another surprise.

120
00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:20.963
- I like the idea.
- Yeah.

121
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.503
- Scene one.
- Alright.

122
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.370
- Shot one.
- Take one.

123
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.511
- [Todd] Is that right?

124
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.344
Pretty sure.

125
00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:34.796
- You want me to do it?

126
00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:35.629
Do you wanna do it?

127
00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:36.462
You're the director.

128
00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:37.294
There you go.

129
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.423
- Okay. Behind the Sightings.
scene one. take one.

130
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.193
It's just like a little thing here.

131
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.150
- Got it?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.393
- Okay. all right.

133
00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:57.170
Hi. I'm Jessica Smith and
this is Behind the Sightings.

134
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.120
We are gonna be
investigating clown sightings

135
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.750
that have happened all over the US

136
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.110
and in some cases. all across the world.

137
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.780
And we're gonna get to the bottom of that

138
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.162
and see what's behind it all.

139
00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:09.233
Do you like that?
- [Todd] No. do a little more.

140
00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:10.066
- Yeah?

141
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.221
Now when most people think of clowns

142
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.730
they usually think of
birthday parties or a circus.

143
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.320
but this year clown sightings
have rocked the entire country

144
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.480
from South Carolina to
California to Texas.

145
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.746
No one knows why they've
been spotted in cities.

146
00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:26.381
near woods and near children playing.

147
00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:28.280
Now. we're gonna investigate

148
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.960
and get to the bottom of this epidemic.

149
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.184
So join us as we research the sightings.

150
00:09:32.184 --> 00:09:34.400
document as much as we can here

151
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.600
and try to get to the
bottom of the mystery.

152
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.351
You liked it?
- It's awesome.

153
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.314
Alright!

154
00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:44.231
(Jessica giggling)

155
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.927
(acoustic guitar strumming)

156
00:09:56.713 --> 00:09:58.613
- Are you gonna play something for me?

157
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.754
- You become obsessed like.
- What?

158
00:10:03.754 --> 00:10:04.927
(Todd mumbling)

159
00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:06.410
Well what's the point of making this

160
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.210
if I can't show off your mad skills?

161
00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:11.812
- There's no mad skills.

162
00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:14.190
- [Jessica] I think you
should put something in

163
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.700
about my humor and my brain

164
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.173
and just generally how
amazing you find me also.

165
00:10:19.173 --> 00:10:22.186
♪ You make me laugh. you make me cry ♪

166
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.478
♪ Jessica ♪

167
00:10:23.478 --> 00:10:24.778
I don't want make you cry.

168
00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:30.093
- You're into that. come on.

169
00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:31.780
Okay. that's it. come on.

170
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.220
- [Jessica] Okay. okay. alright.

171
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.373
- Alright. thank you.

172
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.924
- Hey guys. so I just thought
I'd give you an update

173
00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:38.880
on what we've been doing.

174
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.590
We have been researching
the clown sightings

175
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.670
and it is crazy.

176
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.970
It is so much bigger than we thought.

177
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.725
I mean. there've been sightings
pretty much everywhere.

178
00:10:45.725 --> 00:10:48.857
And what we did because we're
getting a little disorganized

179
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:53.857
is we turned our office into
this really cool war room.

180
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.417
You can see Todd right in
there just working away.

181
00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:00.540
He's been in there like six hours.

182
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.000
It's getting obsessive.

183
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.483
Hey babe?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:03.483 --> 00:11:05.075
- [Jessica] Is it okay if I
come in there for a minute

185
00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:08.410
and you can kind of update
people on what you found?

186
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.243
- Sure.

187
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.688
Sorry. let me just finish this real quick.

188
00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:13.850
- [Jessica] I'll wait. I'll wait.

189
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.982
- Just finishing this email.

190
00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:16.423
- [Jessica] Mm-hmm.

191
00:11:16.423 --> 00:11:20.210
- So basically. I've-
- Sorry. one sec.

192
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.640
Can you look directly into
camera just to kind of

193
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.660
you know. update the audience direct.

194
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.915
I mean. you're a director.
now you have to entertain.

195
00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:31.327
- Okay. so just a quick update.

196
00:11:31.327 --> 00:11:35.340
I've been looking on the
internet. using it as a tool.

197
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.900
looking up police reports.
news media. and social media

198
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.600
trying to connect these sightings.

199
00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:44.750
What I've found is these
sightings have happened

200
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.170
almost everywhere in America.

201
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.820
They've happened. one
week there's a sighting.

202
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.953
the next week there's a sighting.

203
00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:53.870
There's gotta be a connection.
but I can't quite find it.

204
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.740
So what I decided to do
is find a focal point.

205
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.650
The focal point that
I've found is right here

206
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.546
in North Carolina. there's
been reports of sightings

207
00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:06.080
but there's no evidence
of the actual sightings.

208
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.913
- [Jessica] No photos. no anything?

209
00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:09.810
- No photos. no documentation.
but it's just endless.

210
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.330
These people are saying
they're seeing clowns

211
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.780
but there's no documentation.

212
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.240
Just like all across America

213
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.853
there is documentation of these sightings.

214
00:12:16.853 --> 00:12:19.335
So I think that's a great focal point.

215
00:12:19.335 --> 00:12:21.633
- [Jessica] Yeah. we should
definitely start there.

216
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.290
- [Todd] This is a good spot.

217
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.810
You ready for your reporter debut?

218
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.022
- Here?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:30.872
I think it's good. what
you think. like outside?

220
00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:31.705
Yeah. this is great.

221
00:12:31.705 --> 00:12:33.910
- In front of a fountain.
yeah. sure. why not?

222
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.340
- [Todd] Let me go grab the tripod.

223
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.610
- Okay. I'll set up.

224
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.720
So we've been investigating
these clown sightings

225
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.709
and although they
started in South Carolina

226
00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.750
they've become somewhat of an epidemic.

227
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.615
I mean. it's been as
far west as Washington.

228
00:12:45.615 --> 00:12:47.550
down to Texas. up in New York

229
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.820
and we actually read
about a couple sightings

230
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.830
in Europe and Australia.

231
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.480
So it seems to be happening
all over the place

232
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.370
and people don't know
why or how it's connected

233
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.240
and they're going further
than scaring people.

234
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.950
They're actually hurting some
people and committing crimes.

235
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.187
So it's a much more serious situation

236
00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:05.549
than we thought at first.

237
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:07.710
We're going to try and
get to the bottom of it

238
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.660
and hopefully we'll discover more soon.

239
00:13:14.808 --> 00:13:16.700
Why are you still filming?

240
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.420
- [Todd] Because we have to
film anything and everything.

241
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.860
Now get in the car.

242
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.310
- An evil clown expert?

243
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.880
Where did you even find this guy?

244
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.388
- [Todd] I told you I made a
post online and he commented.

245
00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.451
- You found him online?

246
00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:29.240
- [Todd] Yes. he sounded really smart.

247
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.639
I mean. our goal is to
interview a clown. right?

248
00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.370
- Yeah. yeah. and I mean.
he's an evil clown expert.

249
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.010
He must know all about this stuff.

250
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.110
What did he get. like his
masters in cloud expertise

251
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.670
and PhD in evil. or?

252
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.040
- [Todd] Are you seriously
joking right now?

253
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.943
- No. I'm genuinely curious as to

254
00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:45.083
how one becomes an evil clown expert.

255
00:13:46.004 --> 00:13:49.530
I guess the first question
is how does one become

256
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.983
an expert in evil clowns?

257
00:13:50.983 --> 00:13:54.780
- Well. it's a long story.
but to make it short.

258
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.580
I went to the circus a lot as
a kid and I loved the clowns.

259
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.461
And when I became a historian.

260
00:13:59.461 --> 00:14:02.831
well clowns became a natural
focus of my research.

261
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:06.140
But what really grabbed me was

262
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.898
when I started seeing things
in the historical record.

263
00:14:08.898 --> 00:14:11.500
referring to a dark side of clowns.

264
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.035
And it seemed like nobody
wanted to talk about that.

265
00:14:14.035 --> 00:14:16.408
- [Jessica] A dark side. can
you elaborate on that a bit?

266
00:14:16.408 --> 00:14:21.408
- Yes. well. there were
clowns that were. well. evil.

267
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.437
Evil clowns.

268
00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:29.442
- Evil ones?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:29.442 --> 00:14:31.013
- [Jessica] For example?

270
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.990
- Well. it's hard to say.

271
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.990
but there are clowns that
that you've been seeing.

272
00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:46.379
You asked me to come and talk
about these creepy clowns

273
00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:49.900
and there are creepy clowns

274
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.530
but those creepy clowns
are kind of regular clowns

275
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.510
with a little twist.

276
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.343
They're not evil.

277
00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:56.500
- [Jessica] So the ones in
the sightings you're saying

278
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.670
aren't dangerous. aren't evil?

279
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.560
- Oh no. no. no.

280
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.430
The ones that you see are out there

281
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.880
because they wish to be seen.

282
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.393
They want to entertain.

283
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.020
If you go to a horror movie

284
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.150
and you see something
horrible and you go (gasping)

285
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.140
and then you go (exhaling).
you know. you laugh.

286
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.759
Creepy clowns are clowns
for that kind of audience.

287
00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:20.556
but they're not evil.

288
00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:22.817
- [Jessica] Okay. so then where would

289
00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:24.473
the evil ones be coming from?

290
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.430
- Well. you've got to sort of.

291
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.999
have you ever heard the expression

292
00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:35.186
never get on the bad side of a clown?

293
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.530
- [Jessica] No.

294
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.290
- Well I guess you'd need to
know some history of clowns.

295
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.708
Do you know where clowns came from?

296
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.390
- [Jessica] Well. they
started from jesters. right?

297
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.814
- Yes. of course. court jesters.

298
00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:47.200
And. well. the problem was that

299
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.170
some of the kings were sadistic.

300
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.772
And if you were a joker
for a sadistic king

301
00:15:53.772 --> 00:15:56.680
you had a very difficult life.

302
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.860
I mean. you were worried
about if you offend him

303
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.800
are you going to be banished or beheaded?

304
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.150
And it's not unreasonable.

305
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.510
It's not. it's not unusual to understand

306
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.155
that some of these jesters
cracked. they went mad.

307
00:16:11.155 --> 00:16:12.467
- [Jessica] Well that
makes sense but I mean.

308
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:15.323
how do they connect to
the evil clowns of today?

309
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.070
- Well. the clowns that
you're seeing today.

310
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.123
the ones that you see. are creepy.

311
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.570
but they want to be seen.

312
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.915
They want to entertain.

313
00:16:31.915 --> 00:16:36.915
The evil clowns don't wanna be seen.

314
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.440
They are hidden jesters
intent on doing evil.

315
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.040
- [Jessica] So could you tell though.

316
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.580
I mean if you see individual
clowns. for example.

317
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.543
we have actually some photos with us today

318
00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:53.939
and they identify individual
clowns that have been seen.

319
00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:56.885
Is there any way to tell if
it's creepy. if it's evil?

320
00:16:56.885 --> 00:17:00.497
- No. no. no. I. I. here. take them back.

321
00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:03.590
I do not want to make
comments on individual clowns.

322
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.010
I won't do that.

323
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.560
- [Jessica] No. but
this is just explain if-

324
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.730
- No. no. no. I can't do that.

325
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.087
You don't understand.
stop the camera. stop.

326
00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:13.270
- No. it's alright.

327
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.517
Okay. I'm just asking for
help identifying whether this-

328
00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:22.280
- [Doctor] No. no.
look. you don't know it.

329
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.160
but you're at risk.

330
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.290
And my being here puts me at risk

331
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.119
and it's not fooling around.

332
00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.580
This is real stuff.

333
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.980
You'd have no idea what would happen

334
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.997
if some of these clowns
come looking for you.

335
00:17:33.997 --> 00:17:35.430
- [Jessica] Right but
don't you think the public

336
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.450
deserves to know about them?

337
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.020
- [Doctor] You want to
kick a hornet's nest?

338
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.470
I mean. is that what you want to do?

339
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.140
We're done here. I want you out of my.

340
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.650
I want you out of my room. out!

341
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.945
- Alright. alright.
- Jess?

342
00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:46.307
- What?
- What do you think?

343
00:17:46.307 --> 00:17:47.407
- What do I think. are
you serious right now?

344
00:17:47.407 --> 00:17:49.170
Crazy.
- That guy was crazy.

345
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.550
- What's wrong with him.
where'd you find him?

346
00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.561
- [Todd] Online.

347
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.753
- I hope so.

348
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.938
- Hi. Todd and Jessica
here for another update of-

349
00:17:58.938 --> 00:18:00.920
- Todd. Todd and Jessica?

350
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.330
- Sorry.
- When did we switch that up?

351
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.200
- Okay. okay. let's do
it again. I got this.

352
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.410
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.166
- Todd.
- Yeah. okay.

354
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:13.180
Hi. Todd and Jessica
here for another update

355
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.510
of Behind the Sightings.

356
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.020
Now there are over a hundred
counties in North Carolina

357
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.680
but one county has the
most activity. Nash County.

358
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.613
Now what I've done here is
I've started to plot out

359
00:18:24.613 --> 00:18:25.880
the different sightings.

360
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.370
Now. there. there are
over hundreds of sightings

361
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.580
in this county alone.

362
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.360
For example. this sighting here.

363
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.780
someone was being chased
through the woods.

364
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.640
Now this clown had a knife.

365
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.126
Now the interesting thing
about these sightings is

366
00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:43.024
there's been reports but
there's no documentation.

367
00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:45.760
I think it's a great place to start.

368
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.510
- Wait. there's no evidence whatsoever?

369
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.860
Like no photos. no nothing?

370
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.940
- No photos. just reports.

371
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.854
So I think that these clowns particularly

372
00:18:53.854 --> 00:18:55.650
don't want to be seen.

373
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.850
- But wait. hold on a sec.

374
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.230
'Cause we found that they're pranksters

375
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.600
dressing up as clowns.

376
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.930
Is it possible there are also
pranksters on the other end.

377
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.410
like just calling in clown
sightings where there are none?

378
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.535
I mean. if there's no photos.

379
00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:07.670
- That's a good thought. Jessica.

380
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:12.040
but I think these clowns
particularly don't want to be seen

381
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.457
because maybe they have
a more sinister agenda.

382
00:19:15.457 --> 00:19:16.813
- Like up to something illegal?

383
00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:19.494
- Yeah. I mean. there's been weapons.

384
00:19:19.494 --> 00:19:21.140
There's been chases.

385
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.590
- But I mean. people say
there have been weapons.

386
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.423
that's what I'm saying.

387
00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:27.250
- This clown right here
broke someone's window.

388
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.392
a car window.

389
00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:30.180
- Maybe the guy just broke his window

390
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.074
and wanted insurance or
something. I don't know.

391
00:19:32.074 --> 00:19:34.970
I'm just saying that before
we decided to focus here

392
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.210
we should maybe get a little proof

393
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.171
of something actually going on.

394
00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:39.090
- What are you doing?

395
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.080
This isn't. seriously?
- What?

396
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.323
- We're trying to do
a fucking update here.

397
00:19:42.323 --> 00:19:43.920
- I know. I'm just saying that like-

398
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.380
- You're not believing anything I said.

399
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.010
I've done research all day long.

400
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.780
- Relax. relax. that's
not what I'm saying.

401
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.050
All I'm saying is that we should make sure

402
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.400
this is where we wanna start

403
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.990
because otherwise it makes
no sense to do the update

404
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.180
and end up starting somewhere else.

405
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.710
- I've done like 10 hours of research.

406
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.116
This is the place to start.

407
00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:00.127
- I'm not discussing that.

408
00:20:00.127 --> 00:20:01.210
- This is the only place in North Carolina

409
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.805
that doesn't have any
documentation of the sightings.

410
00:20:03.805 --> 00:20:04.836
- Well maybe because there's no clowns.

411
00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.410
- That's what I'm trying to
get across to the people.

412
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.520
- Okay. okay. we'll get some
proof with post or something

413
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.080
and then go. I just don't
think we should go out.

414
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.870
you know. running over Nash
County if we don't have

415
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:14.703
even a single photo.

416
00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:16.560
- Okay. you know what. why
don't you do the research?

417
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.590
- Are you seriously-
- Yeah. you can go and do it.

418
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.670
Yeah. just go ahead.

419
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.943
You know what. we'll do this again.

420
00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:26.476
In our last update Jess
was kind of skeptical

421
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.263
about starting in Nash County
because there was no proof.

422
00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:32.340
but guess what. I got some news for her.

423
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.020
Hey baby. hey. so I was just wondering.

424
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.503
do you remember the last update we did?

425
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.063
- Yeah.

426
00:20:40.063 --> 00:20:41.761
- [Todd] Anything particular?

427
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:43.719
- You were talking about starting where

428
00:20:43.719 --> 00:20:47.050
there are clown sightings but
no clown photos or something.

429
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.973
- [Todd] Yeah. I think I
remember we were focusing

430
00:20:49.973 --> 00:20:53.850
on Nash County but you were skeptical

431
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.750
because there's no proof.
only reports. is that right?

432
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.030
- Right.

433
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.992
- [Todd] Well guess who got 27
emails from different people

434
00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:06.412
in Nash County reporting clown sightings.

435
00:21:06.412 --> 00:21:08.060
- You did?
- I did.

436
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.655
That's cool.
- Yeah.

437
00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:12.110
- [Todd] So where do you
think we should start. Jess?

438
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.909
- So today we have a
pretty big day ahead of us.

439
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:19.280
Thanks to Todd who got 27 emails
from people in Nash County

440
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.760
who all have reportedly seen clowns.

441
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.051
So we're gonna meet up with
them. do some interviews.

442
00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:27.401
some of them said they have
proof and documentation

443
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:29.205
so we can finally get some of that.

444
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:32.383
And yeah. just kind of see
what their experience was

445
00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:35.680
because we know everyone has
had different experiences

446
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.491
with different clowns in different areas.

447
00:21:37.491 --> 00:21:40.343
So maybe we'll get some light shed.

448
00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:48.510
(Jessica vomiting)

449
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.400
- [Todd] Jess. you all right?

450
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.150
- Yeah. get the camera out. please.

451
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.963
This girl lives far out.

452
00:21:58.052 --> 00:21:59.050
- [Todd] It's pretty cool out here.

453
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.183
- Yeah. it's gorgeous.

454
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.190
So what did she tell you exactly?

455
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.460
- [Todd] I don't know. she
said she saw some clowns.

456
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.479
So we're trying to.

457
00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:10.993
she really didn't give
me much information.

458
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.310
- My stomach's a little weird.

459
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.249
- [Todd] I think it's
coming up here on the right.

460
00:22:23.249 --> 00:22:24.413
- [Jessica] Okay.

461
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.293
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

462
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.433
Alright.

463
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:38.542
(door knocking)

464
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.753
I don't see anyone. but oh. here she is.

465
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.740
Hey. Shannon?
- Hi.

466
00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.720
- Hi. I'm Jessica. this is
my husband Todd right there.

467
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.590
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi-

468
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.152
- I didn't realize you were
going to be filming already.

469
00:23:00.152 --> 00:23:01.863
- [Todd] We're just trying
to document everything.

470
00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:03.930
- Yeah. we need to get
everything on camera

471
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.040
for the interview we discussed.

472
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.940
Is that alright?

473
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.373
- Yeah.
- Okay.

474
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.670
I mean. do you want to tell
us about the clown sighting

475
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.220
and what you saw. what happened?

476
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.470
Just as much detail as
you can will be great.

477
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.337
- Oh. well I've seen two.

478
00:23:19.337 --> 00:23:24.337
I saw one over at the
park on the straightaways.

479
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.030
You know. kids have been
saying for a long time

480
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.767
that they've seen clowns down there

481
00:23:29.767 --> 00:23:34.453
but I thought it was just kids
just being kids. you know?

482
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.973
And I saw one.

483
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.380
- What was it like. what did it do?

484
00:23:42.438 --> 00:23:44.783
- It's just wearing a clown suit.

485
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.653
Just waved at me.

486
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.390
I'm sorry. can you turn the camera off?

487
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.980
It's making me very uncomfortable.

488
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.400
- I'm sorry. it's just. we really need

489
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.850
to get all the footage
for. just to be in the-

490
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.153
- [Todd] Just a few more questions.

491
00:23:59.153 --> 00:24:00.140
- Yeah. just a couple
more questions please?

492
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.030
'Cause we really want to know.

493
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.150
So have your friends seen any clowns?

494
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.664
I mean. was it wearing anything special?

495
00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:09.063
Did it threaten anyone in some way?

496
00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:12.370
- There was another one.

497
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.430
- Okay.

498
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.570
- He wasn't wearing a
clown suit or anything.

499
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.570
It was just camouflage
and an orange shirt.

500
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.703
- He was wearing camo. what did he do?

501
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.620
- Just freaked me out.

502
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.670
I just got a really bad feeling about it.

503
00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:36.553
So the next day my friend got hurt.

504
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.493
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

505
00:24:43.493 --> 00:24:44.785
No. I'm sorry. I'm done.

506
00:24:44.785 --> 00:24:46.530
- Just what happened to your
friend though specifically.

507
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.630
it really helps to know.

508
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.463
- I'm done.

509
00:24:48.463 --> 00:24:49.296
- Shannon. you answered our post.

510
00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:50.129
- You need to leave my house.

511
00:24:50.129 --> 00:24:51.642
All right. you can get
off my porch. please.

512
00:24:51.642 --> 00:24:54.167
- But you called us for an interview.

513
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.255
What the hell just happened?

514
00:25:00.255 --> 00:25:01.223
- [Todd] What was that all about?

515
00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:04.020
- Why is that girl so freaked?

516
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.163
Didn't she call us for an interview?

517
00:25:05.163 --> 00:25:07.000
I'm so confused. what
did she want exactly?

518
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.073
- Good job. you're ruthless though.

519
00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:08.930
That was crazy.

520
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.260
So we've been searching
for clowns all this time.

521
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.053
I thought it'd be fun to
wake Jessica up with one.

522
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.123
Here we go.

523
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.293
Jess. honey. wake up.

524
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.543
Babe. we got an interview today.

525
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.043
Wake up.

526
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.362
Wake up!

527
00:25:41.362 --> 00:25:43.678
(Jess screaming)

528
00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:46.890
(Jess mumbling)

529
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.450
- Success!

530
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.000
- I hate you so much.

531
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
- Hey. I thought we were
trying to look for clowns.

532
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.190
We're gonna take to the street

533
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.000
to find out the public's opinion

534
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.203
about the clown sightings across America.

535
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.609
Hi. excuse me. can I ask you
guys a couple of questions?

536
00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:02.442
- Sure.

537
00:26:02.442 --> 00:26:04.515
- We're doing a documentary
on the clown sightings. here.

538
00:26:04.515 --> 00:26:06.567
- We're researching the clown sightings

539
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:08.370
that have been taking
place all across the US.

540
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.049
Have you heard about them.
what do you think of them?

541
00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:11.360
- Yeah. I've heard about them.

542
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.104
I think it's mass hysteria.

543
00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:13.937
- Really?

544
00:26:13.937 --> 00:26:14.850
- Yeah. I don't think
there's anything to it.

545
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.893
- The only thing I've heard is like.

546
00:26:16.893 --> 00:26:18.540
I have four boys and they're obsessed

547
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.820
by watching the YouTube videos.

548
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.520
So they sit around daily

549
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.220
and just like one after
the other. after the other.

550
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.800
So that's all I've really seen.

551
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.820
- Yeah. I heard about it.

552
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.958
My mom is like. hey. be careful.

553
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.410
- I've heard a lot about
clowns coming out of the woods.

554
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.530
But other than that. I mean.
I haven't seen any clowns.

555
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.690
- Terrorizing children.

556
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.900
It sounds like an epidemic

557
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.980
from the way the news is making it.

558
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.410
- I don't want to be rude or anything.

559
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.360
but it's mainly you white
people that's out in the woods.

560
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.730
- I think they're just people dressing up

561
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.270
and trying to get a laugh or something.

562
00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.850
Or maybe just scare people.

563
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.282
- A bunch of stoner idiots. right?

564
00:26:49.282 --> 00:26:51.220
- Are y'all afraid of clowns?

565
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.024
- I'm afraid of them. I don't like them.

566
00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:53.857
- No!

567
00:26:53.857 --> 00:26:54.690
- Are you kidding.
they're so spooky looking.

568
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.740
- No. you're just taking it too far.

569
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.690
- [Jessica] Sir. even
with the serious incidents

570
00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.523
that have happened?
- Pardon me?

571
00:26:59.523 --> 00:27:01.110
- Even with the serious incidents

572
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.970
that have happened. you don't?

573
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.798
- I don't get stressed out
and things like that. no.

574
00:27:04.798 --> 00:27:07.223
- Well what would you
do if you saw clown now?

575
00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:10.357
What if a clown came up to you now?

576
00:27:10.357 --> 00:27:12.749
- I'd laugh and I'd accept it as a clown.

577
00:27:12.749 --> 00:27:14.190
- You would laugh. you wouldn't be afraid?

578
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.242
- No.
- You're crazy.

579
00:27:15.242 --> 00:27:18.194
- The individual has some
type of mental illness.

580
00:27:18.194 --> 00:27:20.755
- Somebody needs to pray for these people.

581
00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.153
- I think they're creepy
personally. but that's me.

582
00:27:23.153 --> 00:27:25.623
And I'm not a young child.

583
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.807
- I mean. would you ever dress
up like a clown like that

584
00:27:29.807 --> 00:27:31.013
and scare people?

585
00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:33.573
- Maybe.

586
00:27:34.613 --> 00:27:37.220
- I know they banned them
for Halloween. right?

587
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.740
Like they couldn't use
any of the clown costumes

588
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.573
or anything like that.

589
00:27:41.573 --> 00:27:43.000
- [Jessica] I think so. yeah.

590
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.960
- Or in some states maybe they did that.

591
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.220
- I can't wait for the day
they come up with someone

592
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.670
who has a gun. just shoots one of them.

593
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:49.503
Serve 'em right.

594
00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:51.105
- Have you ever heard of
the term clown lives matter?

595
00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:54.420
- The term what. clown.
are you serious right now?

596
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.253
- I'm dead serious.

597
00:27:55.253 --> 00:27:57.070
- How about black lives matter. okay?

598
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.903
- Of course. but-

599
00:27:57.903 --> 00:27:59.080
- We got people that are supposed to be

600
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.765
in authority killing us.

601
00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:03.250
Black lives matter. that's what matters.

602
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.297
- Clown lives matter is a very real group.

603
00:28:05.297 --> 00:28:07.420
- I don't have time for that.

604
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.676
Are you serious right now?

605
00:28:08.676 --> 00:28:09.640
- I'm dead serious.
- Clown lives matter?

606
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.270
- And with that what did
you tell your children to do

607
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.260
if they saw a clown?

608
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.064
- Well. if somebody
approaches them to run away.

609
00:28:17.064 --> 00:28:19.550
We had a conversation. other than that.

610
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.270
- And call the authorities?
- Yeah.

611
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.971
- Wonderful. thank you guys for your time.

612
00:28:22.971 --> 00:28:24.790
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

613
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.360
- [Todd] So Jessica. tell us your opinion

614
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.134
about the general
public's interviews today.

615
00:28:28.134 --> 00:28:30.470
- I thought it was really cool.

616
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.190
A lot of people already
knew about the sightings

617
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.460
which is great for us.

618
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.600
It makes our jobs easier.

619
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.027
- [Todd] Yeah. pretty crazy.

620
00:28:36.027 --> 00:28:37.533
Who's this guy?

621
00:28:37.533 --> 00:28:39.193
- I have no idea.

622
00:28:40.447 --> 00:28:43.105
- Hey. y'all are the ones
looking for the clowns?

623
00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:46.680
- We're here with Sam who saw
a real live clown sighting

624
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.100
up close just near here.

625
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.934
And if you could tell us a
bit about it. that'd be great.

626
00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:54.190
- Yeah. shit. it was me and
a couple of my homeboys.

627
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.520
you know. we was just riding around.

628
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.770
headed to our usual spot
where we turned up at

629
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.410
down on Peachtree Way. It was
in the cut. it's a dead end

630
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.270
so. you know. one of
the few places we can go

631
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.450
and smoke our smoke and drink our drink

632
00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.730
without the police bothering us and shit.

633
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.400
So. you know. after a
little while. you know.

634
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.940
we turn it up. having a good time

635
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.784
and then we thought we saw
some shit in the woods.

636
00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:15.420
So we got a little bit
closer to just make sure

637
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.520
it wasn't just the liquor fucking with us.

638
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.750
And when we got closer

639
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.443
it was a God damn clown. man.

640
00:29:20.443 --> 00:29:22.820
- In the woods?
- In the fucking woods.

641
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.900
- What was he doing?

642
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.670
- Shit. one of 'em ran out in the street.

643
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.660
started dancing and
shit. acting all crazy.

644
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.860
I don't know if he was
trying to scare us or what

645
00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.030
but it actually was crazy.

646
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.370
- Wow. I mean have you
been back there since?

647
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.203
Have you seen them again?

648
00:29:36.203 --> 00:29:38.190
- Hell no. we haven't
been back there since.

649
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.290
We heard them motherfuckers
is down there every night.

650
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.633
We don't fuck with no clowns like that.

651
00:29:41.633 --> 00:29:42.466
- Every night?

652
00:29:42.466 --> 00:29:43.890
- Every nights is what I was told.

653
00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.020
- Well. do you have
directions to this place?

654
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.987
You remember where it is. right?

655
00:29:46.987 --> 00:29:49.360
- [Todd] We don't actually.
we don't need directions.

656
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.240
- We definitely do need
directions to a clown sighting.

657
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.480
Yeah. can you point out the way

658
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.270
or just write out some directions?

659
00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.236
- I tell you what. give me a minute.

660
00:29:57.236 --> 00:29:58.980
I'll write the directions out for you.

661
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.268
- Awesome. thank you so much.

662
00:30:00.268 --> 00:30:01.497
What do you mean we don't need?

663
00:30:01.497 --> 00:30:03.340
- You could read my writing. right?

664
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.610
- Yeah. I got it man. thanks.

665
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.486
- Now listen. if some shit
happens there to y'all.

666
00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:08.625
don't come looking for me.

667
00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:10.820
- All right. thank you.

668
00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.510
- [Todd] Okay. yeah. y'all be careful.

669
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.740
It sounds like a fucking setup.

670
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.573
- Can you.

671
00:30:15.573 --> 00:30:17.802
Hey guys so after discussing it for a bit.

672
00:30:17.802 --> 00:30:20.560
we decided we're gonna
follow up Sam's story

673
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.310
and head out to Peachtree Way at night.

674
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.110
Hopefully we get to
experience a clown sighting

675
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.210
for ourselves and of course.
document it all on camera.

676
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.250
So we're going to have
some equipment with us

677
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.790
that actually you can
explain cause I don't get it.

678
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.870
- So both. as Jessica was saying.

679
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.720
we're gonna have certain
equipment. some for safety.

680
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.440
we're gonna have two
cameras rolling at all times

681
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.954
to document the clown sightings.

682
00:30:42.954 --> 00:30:45.460
For safety. Sam said it's a dead end road

683
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.610
so we're going to park so
our car is facing the exit.

684
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.110
If we need to get out. we can.

685
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.300
Also. I've got this
military grade flashlight.

686
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.875
It's pretty cool. it's
got like five settings.

687
00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:55.010
So basic flashlight.

688
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.460
it's a little dimmer.

689
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.060
I know there's a. yeah. there's
a self-defense mechanism.

690
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.878
Now this comes in handy in
case anything goes wrong.

691
00:31:03.878 --> 00:31:08.310
So. come with us as we try to experience

692
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.660
a real life clown sighting.

693
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.725
- Do you think we will?

694
00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:15.196
- [Todd] Do you know where the turn is?

695
00:31:15.196 --> 00:31:16.803
- [Jessica] Should be coming up.

696
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.543
Oh wait. yeah.

697
00:31:23.004 --> 00:31:24.103
I think so.

698
00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:26.916
Alright.

699
00:31:26.916 --> 00:31:27.749
(blinker clicking)

700
00:31:27.749 --> 00:31:30.940
So we are going down Peachtree Way

701
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.004
to hopefully spot some clown. oh wow.

702
00:31:35.004 --> 00:31:37.260
(Jessica whispering)

703
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.225
- [Todd] Oh my God. look at this place.

704
00:31:39.225 --> 00:31:40.808
- [Jessica] My God.

705
00:31:45.223 --> 00:31:48.020
- [Todd] This is insane.

706
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.370
- [Jessica] This is creepy.

707
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.410
We better see some clowns out here.

708
00:31:59.996 --> 00:32:01.493
- [Todd] I feel like
this would be the place.

709
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.951
It's freaking pitch dark.

710
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:12.368
- [Jessica] Yeah.

711
00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.913
All right. I'm gonna turn around.

712
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.160
- [Todd] Yeah. just like turn around

713
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.200
so if we have to get out we can.

714
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.384
Yeah. try and point your lights towards.

715
00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:38.953
- [Jessica] Yeah. yeah.

716
00:32:38.953 --> 00:32:41.203
(mumbling)

717
00:32:44.286 --> 00:32:46.086
- [Todd] Oh my God. are you nervous?

718
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.420
- A little. you ready for this?

719
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.703
- [Todd] I was born ready.

720
00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:54.050
- [Jessica] Oh my God. it's gonna be epic.

721
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.920
Like look at this place right now.

722
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.808
If I can get a video of a
clown. like right down here.

723
00:32:57.808 --> 00:33:01.448
- [Todd] Come on. clowny clowns.

724
00:33:01.448 --> 00:33:02.550
(giggling)

725
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.293
- [Jessica] I doubt they're
gonna respond to that.

726
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.250
How far are we from like anywhere
at the moment. any place?

727
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.293
- [Todd] I was actually
wondering the same thing.

728
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.040
You know what else sounds
kind of fun to do out here?

729
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.976
- What?

730
00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:24.220
- [Todd] Well. we haven't
broken in our car yet.

731
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.290
- True.
- Hey.

732
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.283
- But I think it'll be hard
for you to keep filming.

733
00:33:28.283 --> 00:33:29.730
- [Todd] Why?

734
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.480
I think the audience would love it.

735
00:33:32.587 --> 00:33:33.920
Come on. show us a little skin.

736
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.340
- No.
- Come on.

737
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.620
- No.
- Just a little bit.

738
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.780
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah.

739
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.317
- Just like right here.
- Woo!

740
00:33:40.317 --> 00:33:43.750
Hey. I'll turn the camera
away. you show me your boobs.

741
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.156
- [Jessica] Hey!

742
00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:48.416
- [Todd] It is pretty
creepy out here though.

743
00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:50.340
- [Jessica] Ya think?

744
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.803
- [Todd] Like if you actually
saw one. what would you do?

745
00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:55.273
- [Jessica] What would I do?

746
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.680
I mean. I would try
obviously to tell you to

747
00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.970
get the best shot of it.

748
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.861
And then I'd runaway like
hell. that's what I'd do.

749
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.710
- [Todd] Do you have any
service on your phone?

750
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.543
- [Jessica] I have absolutely nothing.

751
00:34:06.543 --> 00:34:07.750
- [Todd] Yeah. me neither.

752
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.860
- [Jessica] Great.

753
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.860
- [Todd] Man. this is. this
is officially exhausting.

754
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.862
- [Jessica] How long have we been here?

755
00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.090
- [Todd] Two and a half hours now.

756
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.003
- [Jessica] Jesus.

757
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:23.922
- [Todd] I know. we didn't see anything.

758
00:34:23.922 --> 00:34:26.472
It's like. is this the wrong place?

759
00:34:26.472 --> 00:34:28.080
- [Jessica] No. he said Peachtree Way.

760
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.913
This is Peachtree Way.

761
00:34:28.913 --> 00:34:30.050
- [Todd] You sure you
didn't write the directions?

762
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.329
- [Jessica] No. I'm sure I wrote it right.

763
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:34.362
All right. let's leave.

764
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.380
- [Todd] I don't know.

765
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.530
Holy fuck!
- What just happened?

766
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.150
- [Todd] There was a fucking clown

767
00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.099
right outside your window!

768
00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:46.851
- [Jessica] I definitely saw something-

769
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.601
- Grab the tripod!
- Yeah. gotcha.

770
00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.572
I can't see anything.

771
00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:56.822
- [Todd] Just be careful.

772
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.800
Who is that?
- I don't know.

773
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.633
- [Todd] Hey!

774
00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:17.120
- [Jessica] Now what the fuck is he doing?

775
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.113
- I have no idea.

776
00:35:19.134 --> 00:35:20.993
- Oh my gosh. this is gold!

777
00:35:22.967 --> 00:35:25.140
Just keep filming. I'm
gonna get a closer look.

778
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.093
- [Jessica] Okay. be careful. please.

779
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.293
- [Todd] Holy shit!

780
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.383
Nice dance moves.

781
00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:40.999
I waited a long time for you. buddy.

782
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.407
- [Jessica] Todd. please
don't go too far. Todd.

783
00:35:45.407 --> 00:35:46.342
- He's just dancing.

784
00:35:46.342 --> 00:35:47.175
- [Jessica] Oh God.

785
00:35:47.175 --> 00:35:48.540
- [Todd] Is this a fucking joke?

786
00:35:50.629 --> 00:35:51.462
Amazing.

787
00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:52.816
(bushes rustling)

788
00:35:52.816 --> 00:35:54.933
- [Jessica] Todd. look
out. right behind you!

789
00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:56.239
- Holy shit!
- Holy fuck!

790
00:35:56.239 --> 00:35:57.406
- [Todd] Fuck.

791
00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:01.435
- [Jessica] Jesus. how
many of them are there?

792
00:36:01.435 --> 00:36:03.490
- Did you get that?
- I got that!

793
00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.410
- Oh my God. this is fucking amazing.

794
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.195
- [Jessica] You see 'em?

795
00:36:08.195 --> 00:36:09.470
- [Todd] I want to get a better look.

796
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.690
- [Jessica] Todd. I don't
think that's a great idea.

797
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.620
- Just get in the car.

798
00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.853
- [Jessica] Oh jeez. fuck.

799
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:24.041
- [Todd] Fuck he go?

800
00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:33.955
Shit.

801
00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:35.788
God. you fucking fuck.

802
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:39.768
Oh shit.

803
00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:42.263
Hey. we just want an interview!

804
00:36:47.444 --> 00:36:49.350
(Jess screaming)

805
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.183
Jess!

806
00:36:56.984 --> 00:36:58.151
Oh fuck. fuck!

807
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.953
Shit!

808
00:37:09.668 --> 00:37:12.501
(heavy breathing)

809
00:37:16.759 --> 00:37:17.592
The fuck!

810
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:19.824
Oh shit.

811
00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:38.535
Jess. can you hear me?

812
00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:47.352
Oh fuck. shit!

813
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:52.418
Come on. man. leave us alone!

814
00:37:52.418 --> 00:37:53.663
Jess!

815
00:37:53.663 --> 00:37:54.903
Oh shit!

816
00:37:54.903 --> 00:37:55.736
Fuck!

817
00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.003
Jess!

818
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:02.452
I can't find my way out!

819
00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:03.869
I'm fucking lost!

820
00:38:13.649 --> 00:38:14.649
What the fu-

821
00:38:24.247 --> 00:38:26.214
Hey. come on. man. go on home!

822
00:38:26.214 --> 00:38:27.047
Go on.

823
00:38:29.034 --> 00:38:31.201
(banging)

824
00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:34.432
Get off me. get off me!

825
00:38:34.432 --> 00:38:37.182
(Todd screaming)

826
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.807
Get off of me!

827
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:52.144
Jess!

828
00:39:03.544 --> 00:39:04.377
Jess!

829
00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:09.167
Fuck. shit. fuck!

830
00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:16.596
Jess. help. Jess!

831
00:39:18.363 --> 00:39:19.867
Jess. can you hear me?

832
00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:23.763
- [Jessica] Todd. follow
the sound of my voice!

833
00:39:23.763 --> 00:39:25.573
- [Todd] Jess. get in the car!

834
00:39:25.573 --> 00:39:27.201
Get in the fucking car!
- Okay!

835
00:39:27.201 --> 00:39:28.550
- They're trying to kill us!

836
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.800
Get in the car!

837
00:39:30.831 --> 00:39:31.664
- [Jessica] What happened?

838
00:39:31.664 --> 00:39:32.497
Oh my God. you're bleeding.

839
00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:33.558
- Get in the car and start going!

840
00:39:33.558 --> 00:39:36.947
- Where?
- Just drive. he'll move!

841
00:39:36.947 --> 00:39:37.780
Shit. go.

842
00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:41.836
Fuck.

843
00:39:42.794 --> 00:39:44.210
Get out of here. we gotta get out of here.

844
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.690
- [Jessica] What the
fuck happened back there?

845
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.523
- Just go.

846
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.720
Fuck. I don't have my wallet.

847
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.030
It could be. it could
be in the fucking woods.

848
00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.698
I'm not going back.

849
00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.410
- [Jessica] I mean. I don't
know. Oh my God. Todd. Todd.

850
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.420
- You know what. fuck this. man.

851
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.540
What's up. motherfucker?

852
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.440
Come on. tell me where my wallet is.

853
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.638
- [Jessica] Todd. what are
you doing? Please get back.

854
00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:12.471
- I ain't fucking scared of you!

855
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.213
Fuck you!

856
00:40:21.124 --> 00:40:23.104
Man. fuck this.

857
00:40:23.104 --> 00:40:25.050
- [Jessica] Baby.

858
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.855
- Shit. he's got a fucking!
- Oh my God. run now. Todd!

859
00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:33.040
I mean. obviously neither of
us got much sleep last night

860
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.430
but with everything that
happened out at Peachtree

861
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.950
it was honestly. it was pretty weird

862
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.350
and we got a little freaked out

863
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.540
and I'm not sure what to make of it yet.

864
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.540
I mean. it was really crazy
and I'm trying to figure out

865
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.500
what our next step should be.

866
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.070
But I do know that I want
to get to the bottom of this

867
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.220
and what the hell went
on there last night.

868
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.838
We still can't find
Todd's wallet anywhere.

869
00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:01.670
I'm hoping he's lost it
somewhere around the house

870
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.960
or outside the car.

871
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.350
I mean. he canceled all his credit card.

872
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.990
called his bank and everything.

873
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.880
But yeah. we still don't know where it is.

874
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.170
At least his nose is fine.

875
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.470
It's not broken like I
thought it might be yesterday.

876
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:16.838
just a little bruised up.

877
00:41:16.838 --> 00:41:21.503
but he's a little freaked
out and honestly. I get it.

878
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.329
But I do think that people deserve to know

879
00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:26.670
what's been going on because it just-

880
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.503
- [Todd] Jess. you got a minute?

881
00:41:27.503 --> 00:41:28.949
I want to show you the cameras.

882
00:41:28.949 --> 00:41:30.263
- What cameras?

883
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.421
- Since we can't find my wallet

884
00:41:32.421 --> 00:41:34.700
I think need to take some
extra security measures.

885
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.500
so I've got now eyes on
the front of the house

886
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.490
and the back of the house at all times.

887
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.870
I want you to see these.

888
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.287
- [Jessica] Okay.

889
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.890
- So this is a camera right here. right?

890
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.770
This camera will get anybody
that walks up to this door.

891
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.540
So I need you to check the cameras

892
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.340
before anyone comes in the door.

893
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.937
- [Jessica] I will. but don't
you think this is kind of-

894
00:41:55.937 --> 00:41:57.100
- You got it?

895
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.134
- [Jessica] Don't you
think it's a little much.

896
00:41:58.134 --> 00:41:58.990
having security cameras?

897
00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.680
- No. check the cameras. okay?

898
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.513
I want to show you how it works.

899
00:42:01.513 --> 00:42:03.068
- [Jessica] Alright. I will. I will.

900
00:42:03.068 --> 00:42:03.901
- These cameras come with an app.

901
00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:05.810
so you don't have to come to the monitor

902
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.520
to check the cameras. you
check 'em on your phone.

903
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.941
- Babe. I mean cameras. apps. this is.

904
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.238
it's a little overkill. don't you think?

905
00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:13.430
- Overkill?

906
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.440
- [Jessica] Look. I know what
happened freaked us out a bit.

907
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.337
But honestly I think
we keep investigating.

908
00:42:18.337 --> 00:42:22.213
we keep pressing and we find
out what is behind all this.

909
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.750
- I guess we do need to let people know.

910
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:28.720
- [Jessica] Yeah.

911
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.910
- But I think we need to go about this

912
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:30.760
a little more cautiously.

913
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.480
That's why I installed the cameras.

914
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.313
- [Jessica] No. I agree.

915
00:42:33.313 --> 00:42:35.330
We should be cautious and
you know. pay more attention.

916
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.440
But I mean. you're still with me on this.

917
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.273
you're not having second
thoughts. are you?

918
00:42:38.273 --> 00:42:40.988
- I'm not having second thoughts.

919
00:42:40.988 --> 00:42:44.050
I mean. I'm a little freaked out. Jess.

920
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.150
- I get that. I get that.

921
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.093
I totally understand that.

922
00:42:46.093 --> 00:42:48.040
I'm just saying that no matter what.

923
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.023
we should really keep going on this.

924
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.433
So you guys probably
realize I've been kind of

925
00:42:57.433 --> 00:43:00.830
out of it the last two weeks.

926
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.330
Like my stomach's been really off

927
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.870
and I've been a little moody

928
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:08.127
and I've kind of been trying to understand

929
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:11.220
what's been going on 'cause I
didn't really feel sick. sick.

930
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.049
but just weird.

931
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:16.440
And I don't know why I
didn't put it together before

932
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.733
but it dawned on me today and.

933
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.890
- [Todd] This is the road.

934
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.440
- [Jessica] Yeah. we are
heading to Old Wayne Mill

935
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.620
for some reason. do you
wanna explain. Todd?

936
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.010
- [Todd] Yeah. this guy Dave called me

937
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.590
and said he had a clown on camera.

938
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.493
Here. turn right.

939
00:43:39.405 --> 00:43:41.133
I mean it's the only guy out here. right?

940
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.033
- [Jessica] It's the only guy

941
00:43:43.033 --> 00:43:44.510
for a hundred miles around it seems.

942
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.222
- [Todd] Just pull up right next to him.

943
00:43:48.222 --> 00:43:50.323
- [Jessica] Yeah.

944
00:43:50.323 --> 00:43:52.323
- [Todd] Let's just be careful. alright?

945
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.090
Hey.
- Hey.

946
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.840
- Dave?
- Dave. yeah.

947
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.188
- How you doing?
- Good to meet you.

948
00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:08.980
- [Todd] Nice to meet you.
this is my wife. Jessica.

949
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.710
- Hi. nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

950
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.960
- [Todd] So you got something for us?

951
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.921
- Well. I got me a wildlife camera

952
00:44:13.921 --> 00:44:16.958
set up about 100 yards
back in the woods there.

953
00:44:16.958 --> 00:44:19.200
watching the game trail.

954
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.325
Usually keep track of
the deer and wildlife.

955
00:44:22.325 --> 00:44:23.967
critters like that.

956
00:44:23.967 --> 00:44:26.451
But the other day I got me a clown.

957
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:27.900
- [Todd] A clown. you sure?

958
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.273
- Oh yeah. clear as could be.

959
00:44:29.273 --> 00:44:32.060
It's just about 100 yards back.

960
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.339
My trail is marked with orange
ribbons. you can't miss it.

961
00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.770
- [Todd] Alright. should
we just take the camera?

962
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.330
Maybe get ahold of you later?

963
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.340
- You can go ahead and take the camera.

964
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.925
Leave it right here by this pole.

965
00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:45.130
You can keep the flash drive.

966
00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.140
- [Todd] All right.
alright. thanks a lot. Dave.

967
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.125
- Sure thing.

968
00:44:48.125 --> 00:44:49.791
Good luck.
- Take it easy.

969
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:50.927
- [Jessica] Thank you.

970
00:44:59.206 --> 00:45:00.100
- [Todd] He said look for the ribbons.

971
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.030
- All right.

972
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.100
Oh. there's one right there.

973
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.500
See. I'm getting it already.

974
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.823
All right.

975
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:13.374
- [Todd] Is that the
second one's right there?

976
00:45:13.374 --> 00:45:14.207
- Yep.

977
00:45:16.019 --> 00:45:17.220
- [Todd] All right. Jess. just be careful.

978
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.810
Just run and grab it.

979
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.503
- Alright. fine. you wanted the footage.

980
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.733
- [Todd] I wanna kind
of see what's out here.

981
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.090
- [Jessica] I got it right here.

982
00:45:31.682 --> 00:45:33.210
- [Todd] Did you find it?

983
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.043
- Yep.

984
00:45:37.761 --> 00:45:41.170
- [Todd] Nice. and get
the. get the memory card.

985
00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.420
- Yeah. yeah. I gotta
find it. give me a sec.

986
00:45:47.143 --> 00:45:48.910
- [Todd] All right. let's
go. let's get out of here.

987
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.410
- Okay. can you. I'm
coming as fast as I can.

988
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:55.156
- [Todd] I know. I just get a
weird feeling from this place.

989
00:45:55.156 --> 00:45:57.343
- You get a weird feeling from everything.

990
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.620
So Todd's been obsessed
going through this footage

991
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.070
the hunter down at the mill gave us

992
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.030
for the last couple days.

993
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.020
I mean. there are hours
and hours of footage.

994
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.419
I have no idea where this guy.

995
00:46:11.419 --> 00:46:13.900
how long has recording in the woods for.

996
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.550
So far I think he's gotten
like three squirrels

997
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.910
and a couple of deer so not
super helpful for our purposes

998
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.890
but hopefully-
- Hey. you gotta see this.

999
00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.003
- Okay. what's up?

1000
00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:29.598
- Okay.

1001
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.240
- [Jessica] Jeez.

1002
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.283
- That's the guy that
assaulted me in the woods.

1003
00:46:38.283 --> 00:46:39.507
- [Jessica] The same one. are you sure?

1004
00:46:39.507 --> 00:46:41.770
- I'm fucking positive. Jessica.

1005
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:44.070
Look at what. what is he even carrying?

1006
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.913
You see that?
- I don't know! I see it.

1007
00:46:45.913 --> 00:46:47.333
I'm just saying it's it's not really easy

1008
00:46:47.333 --> 00:46:48.353
to tell what's in there.

1009
00:46:48.353 --> 00:46:50.873
- [Todd] Look how big he
is. like this guy is huge.

1010
00:46:50.873 --> 00:46:51.706
- [Jessica] Yeah.

1011
00:46:51.706 --> 00:46:53.347
- I'm telling you. I
think this is all we need.

1012
00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:56.350
I got one more inquiry
about an interview today.

1013
00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.490
It's about this guy that
owns a convenience store

1014
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:00.500
said that there some
clown activity. that's it.

1015
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.547
But this compiled with Peachtree
Way and this interview.

1016
00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.378
I think that's it.

1017
00:47:06.378 --> 00:47:07.560
- [Jessica] I mean. babe. sorry.

1018
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.010
I just really don't think that's enough.

1019
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.970
I mean. ideally I'd love to
get an interview with this guy

1020
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.036
and see what the hell they're
up to and what's going on.

1021
00:47:14.036 --> 00:47:15.380
I mean. this is enough for what?

1022
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.610
We don't even know what he's carrying.

1023
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.836
We don't know why they're
out there still. it's really-

1024
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.670
- I don't wanna find
out what he's carrying.

1025
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:21.503
This is crazy!

1026
00:47:21.503 --> 00:47:22.490
- [Jessica] Well I mean. how about this?

1027
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.400
He could be a poacher.
think of it that way.

1028
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.380
- A poacher in a clown
mask. that's a new thing.

1029
00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.213
Why the heck-

1030
00:47:27.213 --> 00:47:28.250
- No. okay. but that's what I'm saying.

1031
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.220
Everyone's too scared
to go near the forest.

1032
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.377
Maybe that's what they want.

1033
00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:34.160
- I've never heard of anyone
poaching in a clown mask.

1034
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.730
Come on. Jessica. let's be real.

1035
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.413
Like when are you done. huh?
- When I get an interview.

1036
00:47:38.413 --> 00:47:40.332
when I get to the bottom of
this. that's when I'm done.

1037
00:47:40.332 --> 00:47:42.637
So apparently there was
a clown sighting here

1038
00:47:42.637 --> 00:47:44.180
and the manager got in touch with us

1039
00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.053
that his clerk saw clowns.

1040
00:47:46.053 --> 00:47:48.377
And Todd's gonna try to
get an interview with him.

1041
00:47:48.377 --> 00:47:50.313
So hopefully.

1042
00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:52.725
- [Todd] Alright. he
agreed to do an interview.

1043
00:47:52.725 --> 00:47:53.558
- Yeah. awesome.

1044
00:47:53.558 --> 00:47:54.391
- [Todd] Yeah. let me get the camera.

1045
00:47:54.391 --> 00:47:55.224
- Sure.

1046
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.372
- Hey. you already got that
thing. Nice to meet you.

1047
00:48:01.372 --> 00:48:02.885
- [Todd] So you said you saw
some clowns come through here?

1048
00:48:02.885 --> 00:48:06.810
- Yeah. yeah. I didn't see
'em myself. my clerk did.

1049
00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.565
It was a couple of clowns.
come in with a girl.

1050
00:48:09.565 --> 00:48:14.070
He said that the girl came
running and she was screaming.

1051
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.600
went to the back and a clown came in.

1052
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.730
stood right in front of him

1053
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.240
and then a second clown came in.

1054
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.550
ran back to get the girl and they left.

1055
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.228
I mean. he was pretty freaked out.

1056
00:48:24.228 --> 00:48:25.701
- Did he say what the clowns look like?

1057
00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:28.929
- You know. a couple of
clowns. I don't know.

1058
00:48:28.929 --> 00:48:30.070
- [Todd] Anybody call the police?

1059
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.100
- I mean. yeah. he was kind of dumbfounded

1060
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:33.933
and just stood there.

1061
00:48:33.933 --> 00:48:35.340
But then after he called the police

1062
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.940
and they came out and then
he called me and he quit.

1063
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:39.953
- Damn.

1064
00:48:39.953 --> 00:48:42.770
Do you by any chance have cameras
or anything in this store?

1065
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.791
- Oh yeah. got my camera right there.

1066
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.163
I told the police. you know.

1067
00:48:46.163 --> 00:48:48.380
I keep it there for robberies. you know.

1068
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.313
any kind of thefts in here. stealing.

1069
00:48:50.313 --> 00:48:51.810
clerk's going to sleep.

1070
00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.400
but they didn't want
anything to do with it.

1071
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.880
- So you still have the footage?

1072
00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.083
- Oh yeah. yeah. got
the footage right here.

1073
00:48:57.083 --> 00:48:59.830
- [Todd] Can we take a look at the tapes?

1074
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.490
- Ah. nah. nah.

1075
00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:03.323
- [Todd] Come on.

1076
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.470
- I mean. if I'm going
to show you the footage

1077
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.480
I'm going to need a little
bit of compensation for it.

1078
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.730
I mean. you know. I
figured you movie people.

1079
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:11.880
you got some money. so.

1080
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.806
- We're not. we're just filming this.

1081
00:49:13.806 --> 00:49:15.950
- [Todd] You got the wrong
idea. it's just me and her.

1082
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.580
We're just trying to document this.

1083
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.260
trying to find more about these sightings.

1084
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.620
We've had some crazy experiences ourself.

1085
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.453
- Yeah. yeah. but you know.

1086
00:49:22.453 --> 00:49:24.440
I know how the movies work
and stuff and you know

1087
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.510
if you want to see this
tape right here then-

1088
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:27.522
- [Todd] 20 bucks.

1089
00:49:27.522 --> 00:49:29.431
- Todd!
- Just chill.

1090
00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:31.620
- Can we. I'm sorry.
can we take a look first

1091
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.300
and see if there's actually
anything on the tape?

1092
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.020
- Nah. nah.
- Seriously?

1093
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.100
- You're either gonna have
to pay me or you can leave.

1094
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:38.933
- [Todd] 30 bucks.

1095
00:49:38.933 --> 00:49:41.759
- Look. is that camera's still on?

1096
00:49:41.759 --> 00:49:44.126
- I'll turn it off.
- Alright. turn it off.

1097
00:49:44.126 --> 00:49:47.910
- I got the tape. I got the tape!

1098
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.040
Who's your man?
- You lost 40 bucks.

1099
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.100
- Hey. 40 bucks is nothing.

1100
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.083
If we can connect these clowns

1101
00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:52.450
with the clowns at Peachtree Way

1102
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.480
we can slam these motherfuckers!

1103
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.443
- [Jessica] Question. do
we have a VCR at home?

1104
00:49:56.443 --> 00:49:58.263
- Of course. we have a
VCR. everybody has a-

1105
00:49:58.263 --> 00:49:59.493
- [Jessica] Whoa!

1106
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.740
- Fuck does this guy want?

1107
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.650
What?
- Gimme the tape.

1108
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:06.610
- No. I gave you 40 bucks.
- Really?

1109
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:08.460
What is it. 1990 still?

1110
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.790
Nobody uses videotapes.

1111
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.373
Here's the flash drive
with all the footage.

1112
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.413
Fucking idiot.

1113
00:50:18.444 --> 00:50:21.194
(ominous music)

1114
00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:04.663
- You guys have to see this.

1115
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.140
So someone decided to leave a clown doll

1116
00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.993
right outside our door.
which is super weird.

1117
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.420
- Will you put that doll down!
- Jeez. sorry.

1118
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.620
- [Todd] Now just watch.

1119
00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:53.523
- Think it's a prank?
- Why would he put

1120
00:53:53.523 --> 00:53:54.356
a fucking doll there?

1121
00:53:54.356 --> 00:53:57.695
- Maybe it's a prank.
- I don't know.

1122
00:53:57.695 --> 00:53:59.174
- Could it have just been a joke?

1123
00:53:59.174 --> 00:54:01.710
- I think it could be
a camera or something.

1124
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.783
- Come on. Todd.

1125
00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.243
- My fucking wallet.
- What?

1126
00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.220
- Fuck this doll.

1127
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.770
Make sure everything's in there. please.

1128
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:11.603
- Oh my God.

1129
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.250
This motherfucker dropped my wallet.

1130
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.050
This is. I told you.

1131
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.683
- Okay. okay. so that's
how he knew our address.

1132
00:54:22.367 --> 00:54:25.034
- Everything's there. but this
is a fucking threat. Jess.

1133
00:54:25.034 --> 00:54:26.110
- It's a threat?

1134
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:27.529
Everything's there!
- We need to go to the cops.

1135
00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:29.730
- And tell them what. that
they returned a wallet

1136
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:30.563
with everything in it?

1137
00:54:30.563 --> 00:54:31.647
- No. tell them that we have surveillance

1138
00:54:31.647 --> 00:54:35.020
of a clown dropping off
this stupid fucking doll

1139
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.117
and my wallet which we lost in the woods.

1140
00:54:37.117 --> 00:54:38.690
- And what are the cops
gonna do about that?

1141
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.650
They stole nothing and they dropped a doll

1142
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:41.833
outside our house.

1143
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.320
I'm not in the mood for this.

1144
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.163
- You're not in the mood for this?

1145
00:54:45.163 --> 00:54:45.996
- [Jessica] I'm not brushing it off.

1146
00:54:45.996 --> 00:54:48.570
I'm just thinking. if they were bad guys

1147
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.834
wouldn't they have taken something?

1148
00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:53.191
- Is this a prank on me? Like
are you fucking in on it?

1149
00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:54.068
- [Jessica] I don't know what it is!

1150
00:54:54.068 --> 00:54:56.787
- Why would you not get
the reality of this shit?

1151
00:54:56.787 --> 00:54:58.550
- [Jessica] You wanna go to the cops

1152
00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.340
and tell them that a
clown dropped off a doll

1153
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.053
outside our house. they're
gonna laugh at us. Todd.

1154
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.580
I understand. I'm not saying
it's not creepy. Todd.

1155
00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.575
I'm not saying it's not weird.

1156
00:55:07.575 --> 00:55:10.221
All I'm saying is the
police aren't gonna do shit.

1157
00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:11.780
All your credit cards were in there.

1158
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.060
- This is a threat. Jessica.

1159
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.310
What's gonna happen next?

1160
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.627
So here's one of the last video updates.

1161
00:55:19.627 --> 00:55:22.646
I've reviewed all of the footage we have

1162
00:55:22.646 --> 00:55:25.555
from the convenient
footage. convenience store.

1163
00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:30.130
Peachtree Way. and these
clowns are not pranksters.

1164
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.316
These clowns are real.

1165
00:55:31.316 --> 00:55:33.967
They are causing. they have weapons.

1166
00:55:33.967 --> 00:55:37.879
They are making. this is the crazy part

1167
00:55:37.879 --> 00:55:40.590
of what we're trying to investigate.

1168
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:41.890
I think we've gone too far.

1169
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:43.420
Jess is freaking out.

1170
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.740
- [Jessica] Todd. are
we still talking about

1171
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.989
these fucking clowns right now?

1172
00:55:45.989 --> 00:55:48.423
- Yes. they came to our house.

1173
00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:50.484
Will you just give me a minute?

1174
00:55:50.484 --> 00:55:51.317
- [Jessica] They came to our house

1175
00:55:51.317 --> 00:55:52.150
and dropped off a wallet and a doll.

1176
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.983
- Will you just please give me a minute?

1177
00:55:52.983 --> 00:55:54.683
I'm talking to the camera.
Will you give me a minute?

1178
00:55:54.683 --> 00:55:56.070
- [Jessica] Can we discuss
what you're talking

1179
00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:56.903
to the camera about?

1180
00:55:56.903 --> 00:55:58.430
'Cause all they did was
drop off your fucking wallet

1181
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:00.190
and again we're making it
a whole issue and I just.

1182
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.240
I'm not in the mood.

1183
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.073
- Can you please. please?

1184
00:56:02.073 --> 00:56:03.490
- What?
- Okay.

1185
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.012
- [Jessica] Seriously. are
you ignoring me right now?

1186
00:56:05.012 --> 00:56:07.100
- In the convenience store footage

1187
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.760
we saw the clowns in the woods.

1188
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.330
we saw the clown with the
machete and I saw Shannon.

1189
00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.088
Now I've emailed Shannon to
make sure that this is real.

1190
00:56:15.088 --> 00:56:16.190
- [Jessica] Yeah. and
Shannon. we interviewed her

1191
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:17.880
a few days later and she was fine.

1192
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.780
That's what I'm saying.

1193
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:19.647
There's not a problem
with these fucking clowns.

1194
00:56:19.647 --> 00:56:20.480
- Do you want to do this?

1195
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.507
- Yeah. we are gonna do this right now.

1196
00:56:21.507 --> 00:56:23.477
- Here. sit down. fucking do it.

1197
00:56:23.477 --> 00:56:25.470
- [Jessica] Really. that's
how you're gonna be?

1198
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:26.347
- [Todd] Yeah. go ahead.

1199
00:56:26.347 --> 00:56:28.060
- All right. here's the update.

1200
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.913
The clowns returned a wallet. Todd.

1201
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:34.033
- Fucking do it!
- I'm doing it!

1202
00:56:35.882 --> 00:56:37.770
The clowns returned a
wallet and left a doll

1203
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:40.090
and we're still making
this a huge fucking issue.

1204
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:41.110
That is the update.

1205
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.950
Do you want to come and add something on?

1206
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:44.250
- [Todd] You got it. baby.

1207
00:56:45.772 --> 00:56:47.480
- You have to relax about this.

1208
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.323
I'm tired of hearing about this shit.

1209
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:53.943
Can you please come back here?

1210
00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:56.090
- No.
- Seriously right now.

1211
00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:56.940
- [Todd] Fuck no.

1212
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.090
You wanted to do it. do it.

1213
00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:02.923
- [Jessica] I did it.

1214
00:57:02.923 --> 00:57:04.510
I said everything that
I think has happened.

1215
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.410
- [Todd] No. you sat down
like a little sarcastic bitch.

1216
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.500
Now. if you want to do it. do it.

1217
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.020
- [Jessica] What the
fuck did you just say?

1218
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.900
- [Todd] That's exactly what I said.

1219
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.350
Now do you want me to do my fucking job

1220
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.260
or do you wanna do it?
- [Jessica] Your fucking job?

1221
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.383
I thought we were doing
this together. I'm sorry.

1222
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.603
- So.

1223
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:27.040
the clowns in the convenience store.

1224
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.697
the clowns at Peachtree Way

1225
00:57:28.697 --> 00:57:32.686
and the clowns at Old Wayne
Mill are not fucking around.

1226
00:57:32.686 --> 00:57:35.810
- [Jessica] All I'm saying
is we can't be sure of that.

1227
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:36.662
That's what I'm saying.

1228
00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:38.800
- Jess. come on!

1229
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.330
- [Jessica] Don't fucking scream. please.

1230
00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:42.753
- I'm not gonna fucking
sit here and do this

1231
00:57:42.753 --> 00:57:44.786
with you sitting in the
back telling me what to say!

1232
00:57:44.786 --> 00:57:45.925
- [Jessica] What the fuck
do you want me to do?

1233
00:57:45.925 --> 00:57:46.760
You want me to just leave right now?

1234
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.593
- Yes. leave!

1235
00:57:47.593 --> 00:57:49.090
- [Jessica] Oh great. fuck. great.

1236
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:59.423
- We might have a potential
interview with clowns.

1237
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:02.363
Shannon emailed us back.

1238
00:58:04.299 --> 00:58:06.923
Do you want me to read it?
- Yeah. yeah. read it.

1239
00:58:09.378 --> 00:58:11.380
- I want to be clear about this.

1240
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.463
The convenience store was a prank.

1241
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:16.010
Sorry to have dragged you guys into this

1242
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.960
but if you really wanted to

1243
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.010
they said they would do an
interview with you guys.

1244
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:21.690
They will be waiting
for you guys on Friday

1245
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:23.842
down at the Old Wayne Mill.

1246
00:58:23.842 --> 00:58:25.810
Helper asked me to send this to you.

1247
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.111
He said that they'll meet you on a bridge.

1248
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:30.350
Never done this before

1249
00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:32.400
but they're interested in talking to you.

1250
00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:37.282
They want to meet at night.

1251
00:58:37.282 --> 00:58:38.115
- [Jessica] That could work.

1252
00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:39.713
It would be moodier shot.

1253
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.970
We gotta get this interview.

1254
00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:46.330
What?

1255
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:47.513
- Look at this picture.

1256
00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:54.480
- [Jessica] Well. that's weird and creepy.

1257
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.530
like all the sightings have been though.

1258
00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:58.550
I mean they're pranksters.
babe. that's what they do.

1259
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.950
They're just trying to scare us. I guess.

1260
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:03.800
I mean. Shannon said they're
her friends. she knows them.

1261
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.800
Please. this is huge. please.

1262
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.390
- I don't want anything to happen to you.

1263
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:13.580
- [Jessica] Nothing's
gonna happen. Todd. please.

1264
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.133
- I'm tired of all the
shit I've been through.

1265
00:59:16.133 --> 00:59:17.590
- [Jessica] I know.

1266
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.310
- Can we just take the
footage that we have

1267
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:20.618
and fucking wrap this up?

1268
00:59:20.618 --> 00:59:24.083
- [Jessica] I mean. this
interview would make the film.

1269
00:59:27.379 --> 00:59:29.129
Babe. nothing's gonna happen to us.

1270
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.140
- There's been a lot of discussion

1271
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.990
about whether we should move forward.

1272
00:59:41.318 --> 00:59:43.047
I think Jess was right.

1273
00:59:43.047 --> 00:59:44.690
You know. this is our dream.

1274
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.270
It's been our dream for a long time.

1275
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.160
It's what honestly brought us together

1276
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.473
so we're gonna do this.

1277
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.796
Hey. come here.

1278
00:59:52.796 --> 00:59:54.306
- What's up?

1279
00:59:54.306 --> 00:59:56.730
- Just telling the
camera how we're about to

1280
00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:00.120
go get some clowns to interview.

1281
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.753
- Okay.
- I love you.

1282
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.630
Sorry.
- Love you.

1283
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:06.463
I'm glad.

1284
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.340
All right. you ready?
- Yeah. let's do it.

1285
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.173
- Okay.

1286
01:00:23.465 --> 01:00:25.632
- Is that the gate?
- Yes.

1287
01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.053
It's here.

1288
01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:34.713
This place looks weird at night.

1289
01:00:35.946 --> 01:00:39.279
(speaker voice muffled)

1290
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.340
- [Todd] Look at that house.

1291
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.510
I don't even remember
seeing that in the daytime.

1292
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.343
- [Jessica] Yeah.

1293
01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.437
Where did he say he's gonna be?

1294
01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:56.087
- [Todd] Said he was on a bridge.

1295
01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.363
Whoa.

1296
01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.720
Just watch it.

1297
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.960
Oh. that's where we. that's
where we found the game cam.

1298
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.430
- [Jessica] Oh yeah.

1299
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:09.030
I'm trying to watch here
but can't see a damn thing.

1300
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:14.720
- [Todd] Oh. look at that.

1301
01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:18.903
Let's turn around so-

1302
01:01:18.903 --> 01:01:20.180
- [Jessica] Yeah. I'm
just gonna park here.

1303
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.260
- [Todd] Yeah. well. let's turn around

1304
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.860
so we can get out if we need to.

1305
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.270
He said the bridge. I think-
- Do you see anything?

1306
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.380
- [Todd] I thought the path
was actually when we pulled in

1307
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.934
I thought I saw a little
glimpse of the path.

1308
01:01:29.934 --> 01:01:30.934
- [Jessica] Oh fine.

1309
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.940
- Maybe you should pull
up a little bit more

1310
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.290
just so we can. let's just get on the road

1311
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.670
so in case we have to get out of here

1312
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.023
we can just hightail out of here.

1313
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.143
Try to stay close.

1314
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:50.970
This has gotta be it. I mean.
this is the bridge. right?

1315
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.893
- [Jessica] I guess.

1316
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.000
- Wait.
- What?

1317
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
- [Todd] That's him.

1318
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:20.501
All right. let's just.
- Alright.

1319
01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:22.300
- [Todd] He's just like
tilting his head all creepy.

1320
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.133
Motherfucker.

1321
01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:27.925
All right.

1322
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.263
Hang on. Jess. stop.

1323
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:33.172
- What?
- Stay here. okay?

1324
01:02:33.172 --> 01:02:35.823
- Okay. I'll just keep filming.

1325
01:02:39.952 --> 01:02:41.002
- Hey. what's up man?

1326
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.823
How's it going?

1327
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.853
So. we got your message.

1328
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.136
So I guess the first question is

1329
01:03:05.136 --> 01:03:07.803
like what the hell are
you guys doing out here?

1330
01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:10.903
Are you just trying to scare people?

1331
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.817
You gonna say anything?

1332
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.373
Come on. man.

1333
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:28.530
Talk to us.

1334
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.690
Can you say anything?

1335
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.330
Can you. can you tell the camera anything?

1336
01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.653
We're. come on. anything.

1337
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:37.973
Come on. man.

1338
01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.716
You know anything about Peachtree Way?

1339
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.040
Fuck this.

1340
01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.520
Should we just pack up or?
- I mean.

1341
01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:51.383
Todd. Todd!

1342
01:03:51.383 --> 01:03:52.798
(banging)

1343
01:03:52.798 --> 01:03:53.631
Oh my God!

1344
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:56.999
Oh my God!

1345
01:03:58.462 --> 01:04:00.109
Oh my God!

1346
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.942
Fuck!

1347
01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:04.306
Oh my God!

1348
01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.956
Get the fuck away from!

1349
01:04:07.956 --> 01:04:08.956
Who are you?

1350
01:04:10.917 --> 01:04:11.834
Todd. Todd!

1351
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:40.433
- Fucking. where the fuck am I?

1352
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.990
Fucking untie me. untie me!

Get the fuck off of me. freak!

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.230

Turn the camera off. I'm fucking done!

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:17.293
Turn that fucking camera off!

1362
01:05:24.039 --> 01:05:26.278
Get the fuck off of me.

01:05:26.278 --> 01:05:29.270
Get the fuck off me. help. help!

01:05:37.883 --> 01:05:40.040
Where the fuck am I?

1366
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.873
Untie me!

1367
01:05:46.382 --> 01:05:49.500
I swear I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1368
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.683

Is someone there?

1372
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.710
Is there anyone in there?

1373
01:06:07.809 --> 01:06:08.642
Hello?

1374
01:06:10.162 --> 01:06:11.693
Hello?

1375
01:06:11.693 --> 01:06:14.443
(Jess screaming)

1376
01:06:20.335 --> 01:06:22.421
Can anyone hear me?

1377
01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:24.710
- Fucking I'm done. fucking stop!

1378
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:25.920

1380
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:28.910
- [Jessica] I need help.

1381
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.687
Oh thank God.

1382
01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:35.891
Oh fuck.

1383
01:06:43.706 --> 01:06:46.582
What do you want?

1384
01:06:46.582 --> 01:06:48.719
What do you want?

1385
01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:51.969
Help. is anyone there. can you hear me?

1386
01:06:53.614 --> 01:06:54.447
