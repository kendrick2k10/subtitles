(school bell ringing)

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.033
- [Woman] Hi. Mrs. Fox!

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.133
- Hey. Vinnie!

9
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.934
I saw the game on TV last night.

10
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.633
My condolences.

11
00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.133
- Kirkland got
another hat trick.

12
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.100
We didn't stand a chance.
- We'll get them next time.

13
00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.667
- How do you do it. Kerri?

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000
These kids love you.

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.734
You've only been
here six months.

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.066
- Guess I just try to make
learning fun for them.

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.166
- Mm-hmm. I try to be
the fun teacher too.

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.033
but I still can't
get them to like me.

19
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.834
I don't know what your secret
is. but you've got the gift.

20
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.166
- I guess I just talk to them
like they're people. Marnie.

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.667
- They're people.
- Yeah.

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.133
- That's where I've been
going wrong all these years!

23
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.400
- I'll see you at lunch.

24
00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:01.700
Risk.

25
00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:04.834
It's not as scary as it sounds

26
00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.133
because risks can be calculated.

27
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.700
Trust me. I know.

28
00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.567
Six months ago. I moved
my entire life here.

29
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.467
Now. looking out at
all of your faces.

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.000
the first thing that
comes to mind is.

31
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.767
"Oh. I wonder if my apartment
in Oregon is still available."

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.266
(students laughing)

33
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.467
But seriously. you guys.

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
I want you to consider
taking a real risk

35
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.567
as we begin our next project.

36
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.667
which will be worth
40% of your grade.

37
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.100
(students groaning)
ABC.

38
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.633
Annual Business Competition.

39
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.033
This was a favorite
at my old school.

40
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.200
For the next five weeks.

41
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.367
you will each start
your own business.

42
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.900
a real business where people
pay you for your services.

43
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:49.066
(students oohing)

44
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.734
Ah-ah. as a fundraiser
for the school.

45
00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.533
(students groaning)

46
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.934
You'll create a budget.
develop an inventory list.

47
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.433
but the most important part. a
comprehensive marketing plan.

48
00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:02.967
Now. I want you guys to think
outside of the box. okay?

49
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.900
Because this is a
district-wide competition.

50
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.934
there's also an
Innovation Award.

51
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.200
which looks great on
college transcripts.

52
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.567
And. you know. if we are
raising money for the school.

53
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.033
I could also use a new desk.
(students laughing)

54
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.700
a new laptop and.
come on. you guys.

55
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.767
please do not make me sit in
this old awful chair forever.

56
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.166
(students laughing)

57
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.567
Think about my back. I'm old!
(school bell ringing)

58
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.767
All right. you'll be
graded on three criteria:

59
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.133
innovation. execution.
and potential for success.

60
00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.967
Get your ideas to me by Friday.

61
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.000
Make me proud.

62
00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:36.834
Have a great day.

63
00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.533
You okay. Clara?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.433
I'm fine.
- Okay. well. I'm only asking

65
00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.166
because you got a 55 on your
last test and a 60 before that.

66
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.633
- I'll study harder
for the next one.

67
00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:51.166
- Hey.

68
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.133
I know it hasn't been easy.
but (pausing) this project's

69
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.934
gonna be really
important for you.

70
00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:57.767
- Yeah.

71
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.500
See ya.

72
00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:02.700
Have a good day.

73
00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.767
- I heard your class cheering
through the wall today.

74
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.467
You make me look really
bad; I hope you know that.

75
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.734
You can make it up to me

76
00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:12.367
by buying the first
round at happy hour.

77
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.166
- Can't tonight. Adam
and I have plans.

78
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700
It's our one-year anniversary

79
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.467
and six months of
living in the same city.

80
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.567
- Wasn't your anniversary
two weeks ago?

81
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.367
- I know. but he's
been busy with work.

82
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.834
so tonight we're
gonna reconnect.

83
00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:28.667
We've hit a bit of
a speed bump lately.

84
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.000
but we're gonna get
back into the groove.

85
00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:31.967
What about you?

86
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.033
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:34.367
- No one new.

88
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.300
Maybe I should get back
on the dating site.

89
00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:39.200
I mean. I have my
feelings about Adam.

90
00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.934
but you did meet him on there.

91
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:42.767
And I'm sure there are new guys.

92
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.633
Relationships die every day.

93
00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:45.834
(Kerri laughing)

94
00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:48.800
But I do hope things
go well for you tonight

95
00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:51.333
while I sit at home alone
and watch that dating show

96
00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:53.233
where everyone's
wearing blindfolds.

97
00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:55.533
- I can't believe you're
still watching that.

98
00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.000
It's...

99
00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.667
Really. really sad!

100
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.100
(happy mariachi music)

101
00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.266
- Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

102
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.100
- No. I'll wait for my
boyfriend to get here.

103
00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:23.100
He texted. he's
running a little late.

104
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.834
- You know what?

105
00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.633
I'm gonna bring you
our abuela sangria.

106
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.500
It's a house specialty.

107
00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.100
Old family recipe.

108
00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:34.567
- I never could say no to a
house specialty or an abuela.

109
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.266
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

110
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.867
- Sorry.

111
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.200
I know I said I was
gonna be a little late.

112
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.100
- An hour is more than a little.

113
00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:47.834
- But it's for a good reason.

114
00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:50.367
I got invited for
drinks with the partners

115
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.834
and the big-money clients.

116
00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:54.233
- You went out for drinks
before our anniversary dinner?

117
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:55.467
- Yeah. but only
because the partners

118
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.266
are finally taking notice of me.

119
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.333
which they don't do unless
they see a potential future.

120
00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:00.867
They didn't even ask
Kevin out for drinks.

121
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and he's been there way longer
and he's got more clients.

122
00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.867
- Okay. Adam. just
(pausing) stop.

123
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.767
We have barely seen each
other in the past two weeks.

124
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300
You're an hour late and not even

125
00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:12.533
a. "Hi. hello. how are you."
before launching into work?

126
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.633
- I'm sorry. I'm just amped.

127
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.000
But...

128
00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:17.533
This is all for our future.

129
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.266
- Feels like we spent so
much more time together

130
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.767
when we were doing the
long-distance thing.

131
00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.266
- You have to look at this
for what it is. Kerri.

132
00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:29.533
- I...

133
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.934
I moved here to be with you.

134
00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:33.333
- I know.

135
00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.033
But me and my career
are a package deal.

136
00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.767
We all have to make sacrifices.

137
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.100
(Kerri scoffing)

138
00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:42.600
- You know. it's interesting.

139
00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:46.100
The people who say that. "We
all need to make sacrifices."

140
00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:48.100
never seem to be the
ones making them.

141
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:50.333
- C'mon. let's just order.

142
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:52.800
- You know what?

143
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.800
I can't do this anymore.

144
00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:57.200
This isn't about your career.

145
00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.567
I have always supported that.

146
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.233
It's about you being present.

147
00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:04.467
being here when you say you
will. and you never are.

148
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.500
- Don't you think you're
being a little rash?

149
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.400
- Just. I'm tired of
being disappointed by you.

150
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.200
Thank you.

151
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.066
Now. if you don't mind.

152
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.367
I'd like to drink my
abuela sangria in peace.

153
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.700
It's the house specialty.

154
00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:30.500
- [Adam] Fine.

155
00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:31.433
Goodbye. Kerri.

156
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.433
(soft ranchera music)

157
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.500
- Another?

158
00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:53.834
- What is the most
(pausing) decadent. greasy.

159
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:56.734
cheesy-filled comfort food
that you have on the menu?

160
00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:00.600
- Well. I don't know about
greasy. but for that look.

161
00:07:00.734 --> 00:07:03.033
it would have to be
the carne asada burrito

162
00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:05.800
with cotija cheese and
slathered in mole sauce.

163
00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:07.033
- Make mine a double.

164
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.033
- Um...

165
00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:15.233
Look. I don't know
what went down earlier.

166
00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:16.467
but it seems to me

167
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.233
that if somebody puts
you in second position.

168
00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:22.100
they don't deserve your
time and attention.

169
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.600
That's just my (mumbling).

170
00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.100
- Where were you a year ago?

171
00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:28.100
Could've used that
instinct then.

172
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:31.767
- You know. actually. I was
going through my own separation.

173
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.934
Great instincts for others.
terrible for myself.

174
00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:36.834
- I think we should
make it a rule

175
00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:39.266
that we should not be able
to choose for ourselves.

176
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.800
- That's a rule I
could get behind.

177
00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:44.367
- (sighing) Thank you
for cheering me up

178
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.967
on an otherwise
unfortunate evening.

179
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.300
- That's what we do here.

180
00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:52.266
Cantina Corazon.
food for the heart.

181
00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:56.934
I'll go get that double started.

182
00:07:57.066 --> 00:07:58.367
- Thank you!

183
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.700
(soft piano music)

184
00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.867
- You know I did
not wanna be right.

185
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.934
but you're all about
lifting everybody else up

186
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:08.934
and Adam's all about Adam;
you did the right thing.

187
00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:10.734
- [Kerri] I feel like
I failed. you know?

188
00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:11.900
And I hate that.

189
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.333
- [Marnie] Mm. you
can't have any regrets.

190
00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:14.867
It was something you needed
to learn for yourself.

191
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.333
and now you know.

192
00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:17.934
- I mean. I've always trusted
my instincts to guide me.

193
00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:20.033
and moving here felt right.

194
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.066
- And it is. it's
just not exactly

195
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.333
the home you thought
it would be with Adam.

196
00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:27.667
- Maybe I should just
move back to Oregon

197
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.533
when the school year's over.

198
00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:32.367
be near family. watch
my nieces grow up.

199
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.600
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:35.467
Well. you don't have to
decide that right now.

201
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.100
You never know what the next
four months could bring.

202
00:08:40.233 --> 00:08:43.266
- Clara's doing just fine.
Eva. don't worry about it.

203
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900
Being a parent
means being present.

204
00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.133
and that's kinda hard to do

205
00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:47.567
when you're all
the way in Texas!

206
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.300
Temporarily has lasted a year.

207
00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.567
so I don't know
what to tell you.

208
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.834
Can we get this one
without cheese on the fly?

209
00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:58.266
She is not going to Texas.

210
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.867
Now. I gotta get back to work.

211
00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:04.400
- Well. that sounded fun.

212
00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:06.033
- Armchair quarterback
has feedback

213
00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.433
about my parenting skills.

214
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.433
(soft mariachi music)

215
00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:16.100
What'd I tell you about
that mole? (laughing)

216
00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:17.533
Everything good?

217
00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:19.934
Welcome.

218
00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:23.800
How's it coming. ladies?

219
00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:25.266
- I still don't know what
to do for my project.

220
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.767
- [David] Oh no.

221
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.700
- I'm doing websites and
I'm interested and coding.

222
00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.166
- I like that. fine choice.

223
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.033
- My mom's helping me.

224
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:33.667
- You know. mija. if you like.

225
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.934
you can use the
restaurant kitchen if
that helps you decide.

226
00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:38.567
Or you could do a
portable taqueria.

227
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.734
That's how Abuela Liliana
started this place.

228
00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:42.567
- That's your specialty. Dad.

229
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.567
This has to be unique to me.

230
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.000
- Oh. it is unique to you.

231
00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:47.133
It's your family.

232
00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.633
It's our legacy.

233
00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:50.834
- So. you'll let me work
here then and earn money?

234
00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:52.767
- Your job right now is school.

235
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.800
If you work hard.
than you can create-

236
00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:55.800
- Create your own future.

237
00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:57.967
I know. Dad. and I am.

238
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.467
- Well. your report card
would beg to differ.

239
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.400
You need to figure
out this project

240
00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.600
and get those grades up. Clara.

241
00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:04.533
- I will.

242
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.200
- Hey. Marnie!

243
00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:12.800
- Hey!
- Usual to go?

244
00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:15.500
- Thanks. David. (laughing)

245
00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:16.533
Hi. girls.

246
00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:18.000
- [Both] Hi. Miss Rossmore.

247
00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:23.633
- I'll just...

248
00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:25.233
I'm just gonna sit right here.

249
00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:29.667
- So. I said. "We always
go to the dances together."

250
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.900
And she was like.
"In eighth grade.

251
00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:32.500
"everyone has to
go with a date."

252
00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:35.367
So. now I have to worry about
if someone's gonna ask me?

253
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.333
Hello?

254
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:39.266
Clara?

255
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.533
Are you even listening?

256
00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:41.400
- What?

257
00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:42.633
Sorry. what?

258
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.433
- I was talking to
you about the dance.

259
00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:45.367
Where are you?

260
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.200
- Look at them.

261
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:49.233
They totally like each other.

262
00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:52.367
(soft music)

263
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.333
- Really?

264
00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:55.000
- Check out their body language.

265
00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:56.533
He was sitting. reading.

266
00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.667
But as soon as she came
in. he put the book away.

267
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.066
Now look at him. learning
forward all alert.

268
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.433
And she usually gets her
takeout at the kitchen.

269
00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:05.100
but she sat right
across from him

270
00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:06.300
just so she could look at him.

271
00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:08.500
And. look. she's looking
at him right now.

272
00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:09.467
She likes him.

273
00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:12.333
- You got all of that
outta Miss Rossmore

274
00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:14.133
walking in to a restaurant?

275
00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:15.700
- She wants to talk to him.

276
00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:17.266
- Maybe she'll ask
him out to the dance

277
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.767
since she's a chaperone.

278
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.000
Then we'll really be the
only ones without a date.

279
00:11:21.133 --> 00:11:22.266
- Really. again?

280
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.700
You know that
doesn't matter. Liv.

281
00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:27.200
All the boys in our school
are ugly and annoying.

282
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:28.333
even that boy Trevor.

283
00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:30.333
I'm gonna go help her.

284
00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:32.333
- Wait.

285
00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.467
Help her with what?

286
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.800
- Miss Rossmore.
for the book report.

287
00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:40.033
I can't decide
between "Animal Farm"

288
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.633
and "To Kill a Mockingbird."

289
00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:45.133
- Oh. both are great books.

290
00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:47.667
but I do love how "Mockingbird"

291
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.066
explores the moral
nature of human beings.

292
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.900
Are they inherently
good or inherently evil?

293
00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:55.667
- I'd say they're
inherently good.

294
00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:59.700
at least Atticus
Finch thinks so.

295
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:01.600
- Every student who passes
through my classroom

296
00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:03.500
reads that at some point.

297
00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:05.133
- You're a teacher?
- Mm-hmm. middle school.

298
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.934
- An admirable profession.

299
00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:10.133
- You've both convinced me.

300
00:12:10.266 --> 00:12:11.800
I'll do "Mockingbird."

301
00:12:11.934 --> 00:12:12.734
Thanks.

302
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.934
- I'm Gavin. by the way.

303
00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:17.867
- Marnie.

304
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.800
- Hi. Marnie.

305
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.767
May I join you?

306
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.700
- Please!

307
00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:27.500
- That was masterful! (laughing)

308
00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:31.100
You are hereby charged with
finding me a date to the dance.

309
00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:33.367
- I can find anyone
a date to the dance.

310
00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.900
which is exactly what I'm
doing for my ABC project.

311
00:12:41.033 --> 00:12:46.000
(light upbeat music)
(school bell ringing)

312
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.500
- Miss Fox?

313
00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:59.066
Wait. you're Clara's teacher?

314
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.600
- Yeah.
- I'm her father.

315
00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:02.900
David Martinez. from
Cantina Corazon.

316
00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.233
- I'm...

317
00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.233
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
who you were the other night.

318
00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:10.533
I don't normally share
all of my personal issues

319
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.433
with the parents of my students.

320
00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:15.100
- I don't generally share
mine with my customers.

321
00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:16.633
- Okay. so now that we've got

322
00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.800
that awkwardness out of the
way. what can I do for you?

323
00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:19.734
- Um...

324
00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.133
This.

325
00:13:23.266 --> 00:13:24.934
- Isn't that a fun idea?

326
00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:26.000
- Fun. no.

327
00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:27.166
Nuts. very.

328
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.100
- Dad?

329
00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:30.700
What are you doing here?

330
00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:32.200
I told you not to come.

331
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:33.467
This is my choice.

332
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.333
- Clara. 13-year-old matchmaker.

333
00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:37.266
What does a 13-year-old
even know about love?

334
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.333
- What does anyone
know about love?

335
00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:40.900
- I think it's innovative.

336
00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:42.834
and in all the years I've
assigned it. I've never seen it.

337
00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:45.433
- Well. of course you
haven't. because a business

338
00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:47.266
where you can't even
quantify its success.

339
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.100
Eighth-graders don't
wanna be matched up.

340
00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:51.367
She's already struggling in
school. she could get held back.

341
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.333
and her mother seems
to think that...

342
00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:58.233
Look. I'm not even gonna
get into that right now.

343
00:13:58.367 --> 00:13:59.734
- Well. I think this
could be just the thing

344
00:13:59.867 --> 00:14:01.200
to get her grade up.

345
00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:04.133
- Her friends are doing
dog-walking and making candles.

346
00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:05.633
- Also great ideas.

347
00:14:05.767 --> 00:14:07.900
- So. why are you
encouraging this?

348
00:14:08.033 --> 00:14:10.700
- Because we. we learn
so much about ourselves

349
00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:12.266
when we climb out on a limb.

350
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.266
- Branches break and
people fall every day.

351
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.734
- I can do this. Dad.

352
00:14:15.867 --> 00:14:17.266
I even matched my
teacher. Miss Rossmore.

353
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.567
- I happen to know that's true.

354
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.633
- She's had a rough year.
and the last thing she needs

355
00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:25.667
is to embark on a losing battle
when her future's at stake.

356
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.567
- Dad. I can hear you.

357
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.700
I'm right here.

358
00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.266
- With all due
respect. Mr. Martinez.

359
00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:33.800
she's thinking outside the box.

360
00:14:33.934 --> 00:14:36.367
- There is nothing wrong
with staying inside the box.

361
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.166
It's safe. it's comfortable.

362
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.133
Good grades exist in the box.

363
00:14:40.266 --> 00:14:41.066
- Right.

364
00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.900
Well. maybe we could get you
to step outside of the box

365
00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.300
for just two seconds.

366
00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:49.767
- Would you give
us a moment alone?

367
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.100
- [Clara] (groaning) Dad!

368
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:54.600
- She's excited about this.

369
00:14:54.734 --> 00:14:56.900
I haven't seen her
this enthusiastic
since I've been here.

370
00:14:57.033 --> 00:14:59.000
- Like I said. it's
been a tough year.

371
00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:02.100
- Which is why I'm so
encouraged by this.

372
00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:05.400
I'm asking you to trust me.

373
00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:07.734
- And I'm asking you
to give me a reason to.

374
00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:10.867
- (sighing) Okay. a
majority of the grade

375
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.100
is based on
execution. all right?

376
00:15:13.233 --> 00:15:16.867
And I mentor them
through. beginning to end.

377
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.567
- I can't even begin to see
how this is even gonna work.

378
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.300
How are you gonna grade it?

379
00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:23.066
Play a slow song and
count how many couples

380
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.800
show up on the dance floor?

381
00:15:24.934 --> 00:15:26.233
- Actually. not a bad idea.

382
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.133
Listen. leave it up
to Clara and I. okay?

383
00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:33.700
We'll figure it out.

384
00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.100
It'll be great.

385
00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:36.033
- She can't fail.

386
00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:39.967
If she does. we're
gonna have a problem.

387
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.233
- I won't let that happen.

388
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.400
- Okay.

389
00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:48.633
- Okay.

390
00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:55.834
- A matchmaking business?

391
00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:57.233
That's unique.

392
00:15:57.367 --> 00:15:59.500
Well. I can't wait
to see how she does.

393
00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:04.000
You know. once upon a time.
you had a sense of adventure.

394
00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:06.300
- Not with my daughter's grades.
never with Clara's grades.

395
00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.734
- You could loosen the
reins just a skitch.

396
00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:10.200
- Yeah. I don't know
what a skitch is.

397
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.800
(Andrea laughing)

398
00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:14.400
And I give her a lot of rope.

399
00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:17.033
(Andrea shrieking)

400
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:18.834
Okay. maybe I don't.

401
00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:20.367
What am I supposed to do?

402
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.667
It's all on me right now to
make sure that she succeeds.

403
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.166
- She's a good kid.

404
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.700
She'll succeed.

405
00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:28.633
But she can't be afraid to
tell you these things. David.

406
00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:30.000
- Know that she's afraid?

407
00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.033
- She calls me sometimes.

408
00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:35.533
when she can't get her
mother on the phone.

409
00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:37.333
- She can talk to me.

410
00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:38.567
I'm the one who's here.

411
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.533
Like always. Eva's good
cop and I'm the bad guy.

412
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:43.700
- There are certain
things that girls

413
00:16:43.834 --> 00:16:45.533
just can't talk about
with their dads!

414
00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.700
- Clara can.
- Of course she can!

415
00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:48.633
David...

416
00:16:50.266 --> 00:16:51.433
She's not going to.

417
00:16:55.734 --> 00:16:58.367
- I fire you yet this week?!
(Andrea laughing)

418
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.934
(soft music)

419
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.633
(cell phone ringing)

420
00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:10.834
- [Kerri] Hi. Mom.

421
00:17:10.967 --> 00:17:12.367
Sorry I'm a mess. I'm on a run.

422
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.033
- Oh. you're a mess?

423
00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.266
I told your sister that
I'd babysit the girls.

424
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.433
now I look like a feral raccoon.

425
00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:20.734
Was way more phone when
you were here to help me.

426
00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:21.967
- I miss them.

427
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.200
I miss all of you.

428
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.700
- Well. then come home.

429
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:27.400
- I can't. I'm in the
middle of the school year.

430
00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:28.967
- No. I meant right this second.

431
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.266
I really could use your help
right now with these two.

432
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.667
I don't know why you
just don't come home.

433
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.767
- I just. I feel like
I'm off my game right now

434
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.734
and I don't think I can make
any more big life decisions.

435
00:17:41.867 --> 00:17:43.000
- Please don't doubt yourself.

436
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:44.667
Adam was a different
guy in the beginning

437
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.967
and we all thought so.

438
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.200
- Felt like I had it all
figured out. you know?

439
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:50.433
I knew how my life was gonna go.

440
00:17:50.567 --> 00:17:53.166
- And you're gonna
figure it out again.

441
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.200
We're here for ya.
honey. and we all.

442
00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:57.300
we all miss you.
- I love you.

443
00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:00.900
I'll. I'll call you
this weekend. okay?

444
00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:04.033
(faint siren wailing)

445
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.300
- And ticket presales
for the dance

446
00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:07.433
are at an all-time high as well.

447
00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:09.700
Now. onto PTA fundraising.

448
00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:12.333
Next up is Valentine's
Day candygrams.

449
00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.433
- Ugh. this guy?

450
00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:15.867
I swear he's everywhere.

451
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.367
- Now. we're gonna be selling
these for a dollar each

452
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.467
in front of the school all
week leading up to the dance

453
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.300
and they'll be distributed
in the classrooms.

454
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.467
- Why has he been
running the PTA?

455
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.233
I thought Marcy Fulton
was the president.

456
00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:28.433
- She was. but she
went into early labor.

457
00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:30.367
so they had a special
election last Tuesday

458
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.400
and David Martinez stepped in.

459
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.567
- Of course he did.

460
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.200
'cause he likes to keep
an eye on everything.

461
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.100
You know. I can't
get a read on him.

462
00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:42.633
He seems like a nice guy.

463
00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:45.233
But then this morning. he
comes into my classroom

464
00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:48.800
and makes it very clear he
is not a fan of my methods.

465
00:18:48.934 --> 00:18:52.200
- Oh. he's a little intense
when it comes to his daughter.

466
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.400
She got a C on her book report

467
00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:58.633
and he made her do three
extra credit reports.

468
00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:00.400
I would've had her only do one.

469
00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:01.734
- [Kerri] Yeah.

470
00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:04.300
- Although. he does
channel his energy

471
00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:07.633
into an insanely good
tamale. which I'm craving.

472
00:19:07.767 --> 00:19:09.900
so we're going to the
cantina after this.

473
00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:10.934
- No. are you kidding me?

474
00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.367
One run-in with him is enough.

475
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.367
I do not need another.

476
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.967
- He's not there
tonight. he's here.

477
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.133
- Everything from assembly.
sales. even accounting.

478
00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:25.266
- Okay. fine. but only because
his mole burrito is amazing

479
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.667
and it helps me not
feel feelings anymore.

480
00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:32.700
- Can we cut the chatter in
the back and focus. please?

481
00:19:32.834 --> 00:19:33.900
Please focus.

482
00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:37.133
Now. we are gonna need
som faculty advisors

483
00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:39.433
to help with candygrams as well-

484
00:19:39.567 --> 00:19:41.033
- Let's go.
- Everything from assembly

485
00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:44.467
to accounting. (pausing) sales.

486
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.834
Maybe a show of hands

487
00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:48.567
of everybody who's
available this week?

488
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.066
- Okay. excuse me.
- No one. okay.

489
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.166
All right. we'll just.
we'll make a signup sheet.

490
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.433
(soft ranchera music)

491
00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:08.734
- [Marnie] (sniffing) Mm!

492
00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.533
Are you on salary here?

493
00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:14.467
- I wish.

494
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.367
When my dad's here. I'm here.

495
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.600
- Oh.

496
00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:19.100
Did ya hear that. Marnie?

497
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:20.033
He's here.

498
00:20:20.934 --> 00:20:22.533
Isn't that great?

499
00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:25.800
- If only he had someone who
could run things for him.

500
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.367
I don't know. maybe someone
that's already been doing it

501
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.066
for. say. 15 years. (laughing)

502
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.867
- I heard that.

503
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.567
And as the owner. the
buck stops with me.

504
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.700
- You know. you used to be fun

505
00:20:36.834 --> 00:20:39.166
when you had a life
outside of this place.

506
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.633
- We both know that's not true.

507
00:20:40.767 --> 00:20:42.834
I was never fun.
(Andrea laughing)

508
00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:44.100
- You two following me?

509
00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:46.867
- It's the tamales.

510
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.500
- Surprised to see you.

511
00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:49.867
given that you have a
whole class to mentor

512
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.066
for that ABC project.

513
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.500
- Well. you know. some of us

514
00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:55.367
like to take time for ourselves.
live life a little bit.

515
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.867
leave the schoolwork behind.

516
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:03.133
And as for the project. I
get some parents in to help.

517
00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:05.266
Three or four entrepreneurs.

518
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.600
multiple mentors help
me divide and conquer.

519
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.233
- Well. if the
ideas are anything

520
00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:13.033
as unorthodox as my daughter's.

521
00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:14.900
you're gonna need all
the help you can get.

522
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:16.800
- [Marnie] Are you volunteering?

523
00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:18.233
- No.

524
00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:20.767
I've got too much on my plate
with Clara's schoolwork.

525
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.700
running the PTA; oh
yeah. and this place.

526
00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:25.734
- It's fine. I can cover here.

527
00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:27.367
- Oh. no. you don't
have to worry.

528
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.266
I have two mentors already
lined up. so we're good.

529
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.500
- You said you
need three or four.

530
00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:34.400
- And I'll find them. Marnie.

531
00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:36.300
- And you...

532
00:21:36.433 --> 00:21:38.266
You said that no faculty members

533
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.200
volunteered at
tonight's meeting.

534
00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.233
You were so frustrated
when you got back.

535
00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:45.300
I know. why don't you two trade?

536
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.400
- No. that's not necessary.
- No.

537
00:21:48.533 --> 00:21:50.934
- You joined the PTA in
order to spend more time

538
00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:52.367
with your daughter.

539
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.166
This literally puts you
right in her classroom.

540
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.266
- In my classroom.

541
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.934
- Great idea.
(Andrea laughing)

542
00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:03.633
- Wow. okay.

543
00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:06.900
Um. you're not gonna be watching
me like a hawk. are you?

544
00:22:07.033 --> 00:22:08.867
Making sure I don't ruin
your daughter's life?

545
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.934
Because I really don't
like to be second-guessed.

546
00:22:11.066 --> 00:22:12.800
- That's actually the part
that appeals to me the most.

547
00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:14.000
keeping an eye on you.

548
00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:19.867
On; no. on. on this.

549
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.333
On the project.

550
00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.266
- Are all of Clara's teachers
under such a watchful eye

551
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.166
or am I just the lucky one?

552
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.700
- Nope. we all are.

553
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.166
Sorry!

554
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.333
Great food though.

555
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.133
- Fine. I'll do it.

556
00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:35.333
- Fine.

557
00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:37.600
Be in my classroom
Tuesday at noon sharp.

558
00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:38.533
- Okay. fine.

559
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:40.767
- Fine.

560
00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:49.967
As you work on your
operating budget.

561
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.200
don't forget insurance
and payroll tax.

562
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:55.667
And I need your marketing
plans in by Thursday.

563
00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.834
Ah. you guys. this is Mr.
Martinez. Clara's dad.

564
00:23:02.066 --> 00:23:03.633
He owns Cantina
Corazon downtown.

565
00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:05.400
Maybe some of you have been.

566
00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:09.133
Mr. Martinez is going to
be a mentor for our class.

567
00:23:09.266 --> 00:23:11.967
along with Trevor's
dad and Arden's mom.

568
00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:17.400
You're tardy.

569
00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:18.600
- No. I know; we had a
corporate lunch thing

570
00:23:18.734 --> 00:23:21.066
that I had to help-
- I let one tardy slide.

571
00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:24.533
After that. I write you up.

572
00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:27.700
- I'll remember that.

573
00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:29.500
I'll get to work.

574
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.800
- And when you hire Trevor
at the Cutting Edge.

575
00:23:39.934 --> 00:23:42.033
your lawn is always perfect.

576
00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.500
I'm gonna make millions.

577
00:23:43.633 --> 00:23:46.066
but I promise I won't forget
you all when I'm famous.

578
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.800
(students laughing)

579
00:23:47.934 --> 00:23:50.266
- I love the name of
your company. Trevor.

580
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.800
I just want you to
be more sensible

581
00:23:51.934 --> 00:23:53.266
with your income projections.

582
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.300
I mean. realistically.
how many lawns can you mow

583
00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:58.133
after school and on weekends?

584
00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.834
But it would be great
if you raised millions.

585
00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:04.066
After all. we are raising
money for the school.

586
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.834
(students laughing)

587
00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:10.133
All right. Clara. you're up.
(students applauding)

588
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.166
(soft piano music)

589
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.600
You're making her nervous.

590
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.600
If you'd just like
smile or something.

591
00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:32.266
Guess that'll have to do.

592
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.834
- I'm Cupid Clara. and I'm
here to help you find a date

593
00:24:34.967 --> 00:24:36.500
to the Valentine's dance.

594
00:24:36.633 --> 00:24:38.000
I am a matchmaker.

595
00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:41.000
So. if you find yourself
single on Valentine's Day.

596
00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:42.500
I can help you change that.

597
00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:44.166
You know how it is
with these things.

598
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.834
girls on one side.
boys on another.

599
00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:49.100
everyone too afraid
to ask the other out.

600
00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:50.900
I can help you change that.

601
00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:52.633
Let me do the work for you.

602
00:24:52.767 --> 00:24:55.667
- Can you explain a little
bit about how you do that?

603
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.266
- Mostly. I go on instinct.

604
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.967
- Okay. well. instinct is
great. especially in business.

605
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.867
but you need to be able to
show your potential clients

606
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.533
how you put that into action.

607
00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:11.300
- So. take. for example.
(pausing) Neil and Sarah.

608
00:25:12.934 --> 00:25:15.900
I happen to know Neil
is a huge soccer fan

609
00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:19.433
and Sarah plays for the Austen
Middle School soccer team.

610
00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:22.367
And I saw them both at the
same movie last weekend.

611
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.633
so clearly their
tastes are in sync.

612
00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:27.800
This is a match I would suggest.
if they were interested?

613
00:25:31.066 --> 00:25:33.133
Nope. which clearly they're not.

614
00:25:33.266 --> 00:25:35.734
I look at my clients and
search for common ground.

615
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:37.433
- That's. that's a good start.

616
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.633
But I'm gonna ask you to
do a little more research

617
00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:42.934
as you move on with your plan.

618
00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:46.600
Marketing is key in
a person-to-person
business like this.

619
00:25:46.734 --> 00:25:50.233
so finding a unique
angle is important. okay?

620
00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:53.734
It's okay. Clara.

621
00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:55.266
It's out there. I promise.

622
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.400
(students applauding)

623
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.467
(Kerri sighing)

624
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.100
(message notification chiming)

625
00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:20.533
(message notification chiming)

626
00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:24.100
(message notification chiming)

627
00:26:24.233 --> 00:26:27.700
(phone keyboard clicking)

628
00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:32.867
(message notifications chiming)

629
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.233
(laughing)

630
00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:44.734
(knocking on door)

631
00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:47.600
(soft pop music)

632
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.900
- [David] Oh. look
who's late now.

633
00:26:51.033 --> 00:26:52.333
I may have to write you up.

634
00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:55.133
- Don't push your luck.

635
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.433
I'm a volunteer here.

636
00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:02.233
- Aren't we all?

637
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.533
- When you offered to feed me.

638
00:27:08.667 --> 00:27:11.233
I figured you'd just bring
food from your restaurant.

639
00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:15.166
- My mother was always
against takeout.

640
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.667
It's a big part of
our business now.

641
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.600
but she always believed that
when you cook for someone.

642
00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:20.633
it should be fresh.

643
00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:22.900
Vino?

644
00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:23.834
- Sure.

645
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.734
You know that good grades
can't be bought. right?

646
00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:31.333
Even with food as
amazing as yours?

647
00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:34.000
- We'll see about that.

648
00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:35.934
We take our customs
very seriously.

649
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.166
Couldn't feed you a mole burrito

650
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.433
that's been sitting
around for an hour.

651
00:27:41.567 --> 00:27:42.633
What would Abuela say?

652
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.033
- I don't know.

653
00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:47.467
But I'm pretty sure we
would've been friends.

654
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.100
- Probably.
(Kerri chuckling)

655
00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:51.533
Then again. she loved everybody.

656
00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:52.800
Grab your tortilla.

657
00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:54.033
You need some carne asada.

658
00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:55.834
Then you can work your
way through the toppings

659
00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:59.233
and top it off with some
delicious mole sauce.

660
00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:02.400
(Kerri giggling)

661
00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:03.667
- You know. I can't believe

662
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.834
you just threw all
of this together.

663
00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:06.300
- It's nothing. really.

664
00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:07.667
- Where's Clara?

665
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.266
Thought she'd be here to help.

666
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.734
- Basketball
practice. until 9:00.

667
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.533
So I'm forced to
feed the faculty.

668
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:17.834
- Hmm. well. it worked.

669
00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:21.867
- She thinks she knows
exactly what she's doing.

670
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.867
- They all do; they're kids.

671
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.033
They think they know everything.

672
00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:27.166
- They're a complete
mystery to me.

673
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.900
- Are you kidding me?

674
00:28:29.033 --> 00:28:31.033
Wasn't that long ago
we were just like them.

675
00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:31.934
- Not me.

676
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.734
I worked at the restaurant
from the time I was 12;

677
00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:37.133
before school. after school.

678
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.400
I loved it.

679
00:28:40.533 --> 00:28:41.867
And it paid off too.

680
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.767
We're still doing well.
even since my mom's passed.

681
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.000
I don't know. I thought one day

682
00:28:47.133 --> 00:28:49.266
Clara might wanna
take it over. but...

683
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200
She seems more interested

684
00:28:51.333 --> 00:28:52.834
in becoming a
matchmaker these days.

685
00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.266
It's only a couple of weeks.

686
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.333
It's not forever.

687
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.066
And I think. you know. the
sooner you accept that.

688
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.934
the easier it might
be for both of you.

689
00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:06.600
- Have we met?

690
00:29:06.734 --> 00:29:09.066
I'm not so good at the
accepting part of things.

691
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.300
- Mm.

692
00:29:10.433 --> 00:29:12.367
Nope. can't say that
I've noticed that.

693
00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:16.333
Maybe you could
try that sometime.

694
00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:26.300
- [David] So. what made
you wanna become a teacher?

695
00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:31.867
- When I was a kid.
I had a stutter.

696
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.600
And even with all of the
help that my parents got me.

697
00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:37.767
it wasn't until the third grade

698
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.266
that I was really
able to overcome it.

699
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.100
My teacher. Miss LaBelle. she...

700
00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:45.433
She really worked with me.

701
00:29:45.567 --> 00:29:47.533
She made me feel like
my voice mattered.

702
00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.934
And she wouldn't
stop until I got it.

703
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.033
That's the power of teachers.

704
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.367
And I knew then that I wanted
to be that for other people.

705
00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:02.867
- Wow.

706
00:30:04.633 --> 00:30:07.567
- Sorry. that was a really long
answer to a short question.

707
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.633
- No. it was impressive.

708
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.433
- Also. I just really like
to tell people what to do.

709
00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:23.633
I try to talk to my
students and not at them.

710
00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:26.100
and I think sometimes
people forget to do that.

711
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.934
- I try to hear my
daughter out. but...

712
00:30:32.233 --> 00:30:33.333
I'll probably be responsible

713
00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:35.867
for extensive future
therapy bills.

714
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.266
(both laughing)

715
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.367
- I think Clara
will be just fine.

716
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.367
- Thank you for
caring about her.

717
00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:49.767
- You're welcome. (giggling)

718
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.066
It's really cold.

719
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.500
Do you wanna?
- Yeah.

720
00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:54.600
- Yeah. okay.

721
00:30:57.066 --> 00:31:00.567
(both laughing)
- Watch out.

722
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.000
- Thank you.

723
00:31:02.133 --> 00:31:02.900
Oh.

724
00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:08.333
Oh no. (laughing)

725
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.800
So. these were on the floor.

726
00:31:10.934 --> 00:31:12.433
And even though they're wrapped.

727
00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:16.133
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't
pass quality control.

728
00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:17.500
I mean. I think we
need to eat them.

729
00:31:17.633 --> 00:31:19.934
- Yeah. the ground
is filthy out there.

730
00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:21.133
We definitely can't sell these.

731
00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:22.600
- I mean. what would
the parents say?

732
00:31:22.734 --> 00:31:24.000
- A lot.

733
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:26.567
Parents have a lot to say.
- Yes. I'm aware.

734
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.834
(David laughing)
- What's so funny?

735
00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:31.233
- Um...

736
00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:33.333
Just doing our part
for the school.

737
00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:34.266
- Okay.

738
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.500
I need advice.

739
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:39.467
I went online and I found
matchmaking services

740
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.233
and they have questionnaires
that people can fill out.

741
00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.266
Should I do one?

742
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.734
- I think that's a great idea?

743
00:31:44.867 --> 00:31:46.967
- What do you guys
look for in a date?

744
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.200
More than just age and job.

745
00:31:50.734 --> 00:31:52.233
(Kerri clearing throat)

746
00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:54.033
- Well. I think you can
learn a lot about someone

747
00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:55.967
by who they spend
their time with.

748
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.567
If it's only people from work.

749
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.967
it's a red flag and you
shouldn't ignore it.

750
00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:02.333
- People don't always
see things the same way.

751
00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:04.433
It's important to date
someone with an open mind.

752
00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:06.033
someone who doesn't think
they know everything.

753
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.266
- Very important.

754
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.133
No one likes to be
questioned or doubted.

755
00:32:09.266 --> 00:32:10.834
- Or bossed around.

756
00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:12.934
- [Kerri] Find out what they
like to do with their friends.

757
00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.800
how they like to spend
their Saturday night.

758
00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:16.767
- Common interests.
shared values.

759
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.633
Those things are all important.

760
00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:20.500
- What do you want in a date?

761
00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:22.433
- (laughing) She
doesn't want a date.

762
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.500
Do you?

763
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.000
- Dad. no.

764
00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:27.934
Duh.

765
00:32:31.066 --> 00:32:33.200
- Oh!
- You like someone?

766
00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:34.233
- No.

767
00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:35.567
Gross.

768
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.166
Besides. it isn't about me.
(both laughing)

769
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.667
I think I know what to do now.

770
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.533
I should have my classmates
fill out my questionnaire

771
00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:43.800
and they can decide
whether or not

772
00:32:43.934 --> 00:32:46.800
they want to purchase their
results to find their match.

773
00:32:46.934 --> 00:32:48.200
- That's a great marketing tool.

774
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.433
I mean. you create
intrigue with the product

775
00:32:50.567 --> 00:32:52.867
and then they wanna purchase it.

776
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.500
- You guys should do it.
since you're both single.

777
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.433
- Well. this isn't about us.
- No. we don't need to-

778
00:32:58.567 --> 00:33:00.066
- I mean. for practice.

779
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.000
For me.

780
00:33:13.567 --> 00:33:14.900
- I'm telling you. I
put my gardener on hold

781
00:33:15.033 --> 00:33:17.400
to give Trevor a shot. and I
might not ask him to come back!

782
00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:19.734
He's doing a great job.

783
00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:22.600
And now he's doing my
neighbor's lawn. (laughing)

784
00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:25.266
Plus. he's willing to
come before school.

785
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.166
- That's great. and thank you
for supporting my students.

786
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.500
- Hey. they're my students too.

787
00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:31.834
Plus. Trevor's a lot
cheaper than my guy.

788
00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:33.266
Don't tell him I said that.

789
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.000
- Okay. (laughing)

790
00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:37.066
- Another satisfied customer.

791
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.333
- Great work. Trevor.

792
00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:40.033
I'll see you in class. okay?

793
00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:40.967
Okay.

794
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.500
Gotta get to the school now.
- Oh.

795
00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:47.333
- And I'm sorry. I can't
meet you for lunch.

796
00:33:47.467 --> 00:33:49.033
I've gotta check
in on Kristy Forbes

797
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:50.800
and her tutoring business.

798
00:33:50.934 --> 00:33:53.266
- Mm. you're running
yourself ragged.

799
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.033
You give new meaning to the
words "above and beyond."

800
00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:58.300
You sure you're not deflecting?

801
00:33:58.433 --> 00:33:59.834
- What does that mean?

802
00:33:59.967 --> 00:34:03.433
- When I broke up with
Dennis. I vacuumed every day.

803
00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:04.700
It made me feel better

804
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.066
to have those little
lines in the carpet.

805
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.667
I think maybe this ABC
project is your vacuum.

806
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.900
- Well. I mean. if
that's the case.

807
00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:12.800
it's only because
this I can control.

808
00:34:12.934 --> 00:34:14.400
I just need more
control in my life.

809
00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:16.367
I don't wanna make
any more mistakes.

810
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.100
- I tell my students there
are no mistakes. only lessons.

811
00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:23.300
Look for the lesson
and be willing to bend.

812
00:34:23.433 --> 00:34:24.467
- Hey.

813
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.900
I bend. okay?
- Mm-hmm.

814
00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:29.233
- I mean. I'm the one that
picked up and moved here.

815
00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:31.834
Adam is the one
who needs to bend.

816
00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:32.800
- Needs to?

817
00:34:34.266 --> 00:34:35.100
You want him back?

818
00:34:35.233 --> 00:34:36.700
- I just...

819
00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:39.500
I want things the way that
they were at the beginning.

820
00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:41.000
when they were good.

821
00:34:41.133 --> 00:34:43.133
But good is fleeting.

822
00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:46.633
- Good is still out there.
if you're open to it.

823
00:34:46.767 --> 00:34:49.300
Don't let this situation
with Adam shut you down.

824
00:34:49.433 --> 00:34:51.200
- I'll see ya later.
- Bye.

825
00:34:53.033 --> 00:34:56.000
(soft upbeat music)

826
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.100
(pan sizzling)

827
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.867
- Buenos dias. sleepyhead.

828
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.300
- Buenos dias.

829
00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:14.000
- [David] So.
how's school going?

830
00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:14.934
- Good.

831
00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:16.367
- [David] And your ABC project?

832
00:35:17.834 --> 00:35:18.600
- Fine.

833
00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.333
- What about your other classes?

834
00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:22.266
- Good.

835
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.533
- Did you finish that essay

836
00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:24.967
that Miss Rossmore
wanted you to do?

837
00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:28.600
- I will.
- And what about-

838
00:35:28.734 --> 00:35:30.967
- Why do we always have
to talk about school?

839
00:35:33.433 --> 00:35:36.333
(soft piano music)

840
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.867
- Look. Clarita...

841
00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:42.533
I'm trying here.

842
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.867
I know you talk to your mom on
the phone for hours at night.

843
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.600
You know. Miss Fox thinks
that I could be better

844
00:35:55.734 --> 00:35:57.066
about accepting things.

845
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.066
- Well. she is a great teacher.

846
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:09.667
- I'll do better at that. okay?

847
00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:13.100
- Okay.

848
00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:14.033
- Hey.

849
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.900
(speaking foreign language)

850
00:36:20.033 --> 00:36:23.967
(speaking foreign language)

851
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.934
Bacon?
- Yes. please.

852
00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:30.400
That's it?

853
00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.734
- [David] (laughing) Okay.

854
00:36:31.867 --> 00:36:34.133
(light upbeat music)

855
00:36:34.266 --> 00:36:35.333
- [Alivia] And
now Sarah and Neil

856
00:36:35.467 --> 00:36:36.500
are going to the
dance together too?

857
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:38.734
- [Clara] More
satisfied customers.

858
00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:40.200
- Did I match with anyone?

859
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.600
Or did anyone ask about me?

860
00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:43.934
- This is a business.

861
00:36:44.066 --> 00:36:45.166
And if you want my product.

862
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.567
you need to purchase
it like everyone else.

863
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.066
Don't wait too long.

864
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.700
The dance is next Friday and
people are already coupled up.

865
00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.300
- So I did match with someone.

866
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.200
(sighing)

867
00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.800
What about you; did you do one?

868
00:36:56.934 --> 00:36:59.266
- Maybe. just for practice.
- And?

869
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.433
Who did you match with?

870
00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:01.266
- It isn't about me.

871
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.667
I'm the connector.

872
00:37:08.867 --> 00:37:09.967
- It's Trevor. isn't it?

873
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.867
- No. it's not ever
someone in our class.

874
00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:15.400
I have to talk to Miss Fox.

875
00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:16.967
See ya later.

876
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.667
- Fine. you win!

877
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.333
I'll pay for it! (sighing)

878
00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:24.500
- Hey. Miss Fox.

879
00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:25.400
Are you busy?

880
00:37:25.533 --> 00:37:26.633
- Always.

881
00:37:26.767 --> 00:37:28.200
But of course I
have time for you.

882
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.834
- So. the intrigue around
my questionnaire is working.

883
00:37:30.967 --> 00:37:32.066
A lotta people bought it.

884
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.333
- That's great!

885
00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:36.266
- So. what if I went bigger?

886
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.934
I mean. took Cupid
Clara outside of school?

887
00:37:39.066 --> 00:37:40.567
Everyone is matched
up who wants to be.

888
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.200
so there isn't
really anyone else.

889
00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:44.734
- Well. what were you thinking?

890
00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:47.367
- I'm gonna need your help
with my dad on that part.

891
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.233
(Kerri laughing)

892
00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.433
- I think you
overestimate my abilities

893
00:37:51.567 --> 00:37:54.100
if you think that I can
convince your dad of anything.

894
00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:56.066
- No. you can.

895
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.500
It's kinda weird. actually.

896
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.767
(light upbeat music)

897
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.000
- [David] A Valentine's
Day fundraising party

898
00:38:05.133 --> 00:38:06.500
in the restaurant.

899
00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:08.100
Now you wanna match up adults?

900
00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:10.467
- [Kerri] You've gotta give
her credit for her confidence.

901
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.400
- It's perfect.

902
00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:13.100
Your logo is literally a heart.

903
00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:15.934
And we can call it El
Dia del Amor y Amistad.

904
00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:17.934
just like Abuela used
to do every year.

905
00:38:18.066 --> 00:38:19.000
- What does that mean?

906
00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:20.600
- El Dia del Amor y Amistad

907
00:38:20.734 --> 00:38:22.667
is the day of love
and friendship.

908
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.400
It's what Valentine's
Day is called

909
00:38:24.533 --> 00:38:26.300
where my mother
came from in Mexico.

910
00:38:26.433 --> 00:38:28.934
She used to love celebrating
it at the restaurant.

911
00:38:29.066 --> 00:38:30.166
- I like it.

912
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.567
I mean. it makes it
sound less formal.

913
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.800
Maybe you'll find a
date on Valentine's Day

914
00:38:34.934 --> 00:38:36.500
or maybe you'll
just find a friend.

915
00:38:36.633 --> 00:38:39.133
- Yeah. local singles will
fill out my questionnaire

916
00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:41.233
and I'll match them
with their top three.

917
00:38:41.367 --> 00:38:45.300
And we can even old traditions.
just like Abuela used to do.

918
00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:48.567
like mariachis could
come and play love songs.

919
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.767
- (laughing) Can this even work?

920
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.133
I mean. she's a kid.

921
00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:53.100
No offense.

922
00:38:53.233 --> 00:38:54.166
- It will work.

923
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.600
Your place is the best:

924
00:38:55.734 --> 00:38:57.533
great food. great
music. great drinks.

925
00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.667
- Okay. now you're
trying to butter me up.

926
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.934
- And I'm reminded of
a miss Marnie Rossmore.

927
00:39:02.066 --> 00:39:04.567
whose relationship is
still going strong.

928
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.467
- Yeah.

929
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.967
I'm good at this. Dad.

930
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.734
Everyone in my class is
coupled up because of me.

931
00:39:09.867 --> 00:39:11.233
- I don't know. mijita.

932
00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:12.567
'cause I'd have to close the
restaurant to the public.

933
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.233
and Valentine's Day is
on a Saturday this year.

934
00:39:14.367 --> 00:39:15.934
- Do you really think singles

935
00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:19.066
are gonna come for speed
dating and not buy tacos?

936
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.333
- Fair point.

937
00:39:20.467 --> 00:39:21.300
- It's a fundraiser.

938
00:39:21.433 --> 00:39:23.033
And as PTA president.

939
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:24.867
you're always trying to
get people to step up.

940
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.367
(laughing)

941
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.100
- Wow. they learn so quick.
- Yeah. they do.

942
00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:29.633
But I really think this
could give her an edge

943
00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.166
for the Innovation Award.

944
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.734
- Which looks great on college
transcripts. right. Miss Fox?

945
00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:36.400
- You know your
father well. kid.

946
00:39:36.533 --> 00:39:38.200
- I'll help in any
way that I can.

947
00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.734
It just has to be after 4 p.m.

948
00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:42.300
I've got Ricky Morris's car
wash business to oversee.

949
00:39:42.433 --> 00:39:43.233
- Fine.

950
00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:47.600
If you can get people
signed up. we'll do it.

951
00:39:47.734 --> 00:39:49.100
- Yes; I'll do it. I'll do it!

952
00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:51.600
Thank you!

953
00:39:51.734 --> 00:39:53.166
I love you!

954
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.800
I'll make it work. okay?

955
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.066
Make you proud.

956
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.000
Thank you.

957
00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:00.367
- So...

958
00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:02.667
We are doing this.

959
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.100
- We are.

960
00:40:04.233 --> 00:40:05.367
It's gonna be great.

961
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.200
- Mm. yeah. this is me
letting go. accepting.

962
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.600
- You look a little uptight.
(both laughing)

963
00:40:14.734 --> 00:40:17.066
This is me very proud of you.

964
00:40:23.266 --> 00:40:24.700
- Thank you for meeting me here.

965
00:40:24.834 --> 00:40:26.667
Andrea's son's hockey
game went into overtime

966
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.934
and I had no one
to watch the place.

967
00:40:28.066 --> 00:40:29.200
- Hmm.

968
00:40:29.333 --> 00:40:31.967
We'll dine in. the way
Abuela and I like it.

969
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.567
- Papa. Alivia and
her mom are here.

970
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.367
I'm gonna go.
- Okay. you got your stuff?

971
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.166
- [Clara] All set.

972
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.600
- Kisses.

973
00:40:37.734 --> 00:40:38.834
(cell phone ringing)

974
00:40:38.967 --> 00:40:40.700
- Oh. maybe it's another
Cupid Clara customer.

975
00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:42.066
I'm at 15. by the way.

976
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.567
Mom.

977
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.633
Hi. Mom.

978
00:40:45.767 --> 00:40:46.467
Bye.

979
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.400
- Bye.
- Bye.

980
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.233
- I...

981
00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:54.934
I got her a phone so she
could talk to her mom

982
00:40:55.066 --> 00:40:56.200
whenever she wants.

983
00:40:57.433 --> 00:41:00.934
She does. (laughing) for
hours. but it's good.

984
00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:01.900
She needed that.

985
00:41:02.033 --> 00:41:03.600
Divorce has been so hard on her.

986
00:41:03.734 --> 00:41:05.066
- Well. look at her now.

987
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.033
She's really coming
out of her shell.

988
00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:08.133
- It is nice to see.

989
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.400
- How about you?

990
00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:13.266
Was it hard on you?

991
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.200
- Sometimes. two people can
seem perfect for each other.

992
00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:23.734
You try and you try for
your daughter's sake

993
00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:24.867
to make it work.

994
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.767
It's never going to.

995
00:41:28.367 --> 00:41:29.166
- Yeah.

996
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.600
And. you know.
sometimes an algorithm

997
00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:34.200
based on yes-and-no answers

998
00:41:34.333 --> 00:41:38.200
tells you that someone
is perfect for you
and you believe it

999
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:41.133
because. well. the computer
said you are a perfect match.

1000
00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:43.400
so you must be a perfect match.

1001
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.834
- We all have our stories. huh?

1002
00:41:47.967 --> 00:41:49.433
- Yeah.

1003
00:41:49.567 --> 00:41:51.433
But I will spare you
the rest of mine.

1004
00:41:52.433 --> 00:41:53.533
- No.

1005
00:41:53.667 --> 00:41:55.367
Please don't. I like
listening to you.

1006
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.834
(soft music)

1007
00:41:57.967 --> 00:41:59.800
I mean. who knows teenagers

1008
00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:01.133
better than a middle
school teacher?

1009
00:42:01.266 --> 00:42:03.100
I have a lot to learn
from you. right?

1010
00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:05.767
- Hang on. I'm sorry.

1011
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.066
Could you just say that again?

1012
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.967
I'm not sure I quite
heard that properly.

1013
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.166
- Which part?

1014
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:10.834
- You know. the part
where you might actually

1015
00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:12.600
trust my advice?

1016
00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:14.934
Hey. actually. hang on.

1017
00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:16.200
I'm gonna get this on camera

1018
00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.367
'cause it might
never happen again.

1019
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.100
- You heard me just perfectly.

1020
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:21.567
- No-no-no. I didn't;
you need to do it again.

1021
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.667
(David laughing)

1022
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.934
(soft mariachi music)

1023
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.367
- Four boxes of 200 each.

1024
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.200
not counting what
we have at my house.

1025
00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.567
Should we have gotten more?

1026
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.500
Kerri?

1027
00:42:46.834 --> 00:42:48.600
Bienvenidos a Cantina Corazon.

1028
00:42:48.734 --> 00:42:50.400
Let me show you
to our best table.

1029
00:42:51.533 --> 00:42:52.333
- Kerri?

1030
00:42:56.166 --> 00:42:56.967
- Hi.

1031
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.433
- This is Gail.

1032
00:43:00.567 --> 00:43:01.367
We're just...

1033
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.834
You know.

1034
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.533
- David Martinez.

1035
00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:08.433
I own the place.

1036
00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:10.734
- Adam.

1037
00:43:10.867 --> 00:43:11.834
Yeah. I've been here before;
I work around the corner.

1038
00:43:11.967 --> 00:43:12.834
- Right. sorry.

1039
00:43:12.967 --> 00:43:15.533
Adam. this is David. my-

1040
00:43:15.667 --> 00:43:17.900
- You know I don't like
to put labels on things.

1041
00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:20.467
Let's just say good friends.

1042
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.867
- Right. good friends.

1043
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.066
- Wow.

1044
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.633
That's fast.

1045
00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:26.567
- Well. you know what they say.

1046
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.867
"When it's right. it's right."

1047
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.834
Right?
- Right. (laughing)

1048
00:43:32.867 --> 00:43:34.533
Enjoy your dinner.

1049
00:43:34.667 --> 00:43:36.867
- Let me show you to your table.

1050
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.667
- Have a good night.

1051
00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:42.367
(Kerri exhaling)

1052
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.066
- Thank you for that.
- Anytime.

1053
00:43:46.734 --> 00:43:50.700
That wasn't awkward at all.
(Kerri laughing)

1054
00:43:50.834 --> 00:43:53.700
- Sorry I'm late. but
Jacob won it for them

1055
00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:55.333
in sudden death overtime!
- That's great!

1056
00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:57.066
- (laughing) I'm
such a proud mom!

1057
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.934
- [David] He's leaving
senior year in style.

1058
00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:02.000
- Is it okay if I leave
my car in the lot tonight?

1059
00:44:02.133 --> 00:44:04.066
- Of course.
- Think I'm gonna walk home.

1060
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.233
- All right. goodnight.

1061
00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:08.000
- Go. walk that lady home.

1062
00:44:14.467 --> 00:44:17.633
- What do you do when the life
you thought you'd have ends?

1063
00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:21.200
Change your identity. dye your
hair green. (laughing) what?

1064
00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.633
- They say acceptance
is the first step.

1065
00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:26.433
- Oof. I liked that word
better when it was about you.

1066
00:44:27.633 --> 00:44:29.667
- It's a nice night.
do you wanna sit?

1067
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.600
- Yeah.

1068
00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:37.133
- I say you focus on the
things that make you happy.

1069
00:44:40.133 --> 00:44:42.400
- And what makes you happy?

1070
00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:45.000
- I've always wanted
to visit Veracruz.

1071
00:44:45.133 --> 00:44:46.767
where my mom came
from in Mexico.

1072
00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:50.100
Almost every single item on
my menu was invented there.

1073
00:44:50.233 --> 00:44:53.633
It's such a part of my life
and I've never even seen it.

1074
00:44:53.767 --> 00:44:55.333
- What's stopping you?

1075
00:44:55.467 --> 00:44:56.667
- I don't know.

1076
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.133
I'll go someday.

1077
00:44:58.266 --> 00:45:00.567
- Mm. someday is now.

1078
00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:09.233
- Look. I know that
(pausing) your life

1079
00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:11.934
hasn't turned out
the way you expected.

1080
00:45:12.066 --> 00:45:14.567
but that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

1081
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.533
Maybe it will better.
(soft music)

1082
00:45:18.767 --> 00:45:19.567
- You don't know that.

1083
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.233
- I don't not know that.

1084
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.166
Mine is different.

1085
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:25.900
It's not worse.

1086
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.233
It's getting better every day.

1087
00:45:31.066 --> 00:45:35.734
Clara's doing great. and I
have you to thank for that.

1088
00:45:37.066 --> 00:45:39.467
- Wasn't me. it's the project.
- No.

1089
00:45:41.433 --> 00:45:42.233
It's you.

1090
00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:45.266
It's you.

1091
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.567
You've given her excitement
that she hasn't felt in a while.

1092
00:45:50.734 --> 00:45:51.667
Neither of us have.

1093
00:45:53.934 --> 00:45:54.734
- Same.

1094
00:45:57.066 --> 00:45:58.266
I was beginning to
think I didn't know

1095
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.133
what a reliable. nice
guy looked like...

1096
00:46:06.266 --> 00:46:09.066
Until you came into my
classroom and threatened me.

1097
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.967
- I did not threaten you.

1098
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.033
- (laughing) Yes you did!

1099
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:17.333
Uh. "If she fails. we're
gonna have a problem."

1100
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.467
- Look. I still stand
by that statement.

1101
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:29.934
You're just lucky she's doing
so much better now. (laughing)

1102
00:46:32.266 --> 00:46:33.934
- And you were worried
no one was gonna pay you

1103
00:46:34.066 --> 00:46:35.867
to design a website.

1104
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.133
Look at you.

1105
00:46:37.266 --> 00:46:39.100
I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

1106
00:46:39.233 --> 00:46:40.600
- Good. now you
take that number.

1107
00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:44.033
and this is where you put
in your operating costs.

1108
00:46:44.166 --> 00:46:44.934
- Hey.

1109
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.233
Did I match with anyone?

1110
00:46:48.367 --> 00:46:49.500
- I don't know.

1111
00:46:49.633 --> 00:46:52.333
I have to check my
records. in here.

1112
00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:54.467
I don't remember
every one of them.

1113
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.033
- Okay. (laughing)

1114
00:46:56.166 --> 00:46:57.367
Cool.

1115
00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.500
- Cool.

1116
00:46:58.633 --> 00:47:02.266
(sighing) Blew it.

1117
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.200
It's okay.

1118
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.533
Hey. Miss Fox. can
you sign my flyer?

1119
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:11.367
- Sure.

1120
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.767
Let's see.

1121
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.767
Okay. and you've already
purchased this domain. correct?

1122
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.867
- Yes. and Liv made the website.

1123
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.533
- I love it. supporting
each other's businesses.

1124
00:47:21.834 --> 00:47:23.667
Okay. great; send me the
website when it's live

1125
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.200
and your flyer is approved.

1126
00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:28.734
- Not so fast. lady.
- What?

1127
00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:30.133
What's wrong with it?

1128
00:47:30.266 --> 00:47:32.233
- As if you don't know.

1129
00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:33.900
- No. I don't know.

1130
00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:34.834
- Look closely.

1131
00:47:39.767 --> 00:47:41.233
- Nope. nothing.

1132
00:47:41.367 --> 00:47:42.834
- Branding.

1133
00:47:42.967 --> 00:47:45.300
Unless you include my official
logo on there. I'm out.

1134
00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:47.033
- I can't believe I
forgot about that.

1135
00:47:47.166 --> 00:47:48.233
Sorry.

1136
00:47:48.367 --> 00:47:49.300
- It's okay. it's
not your fault. mama.

1137
00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:50.233
It's your mentor.

1138
00:47:52.266 --> 00:47:53.467
- Here you go. good job.

1139
00:47:57.967 --> 00:47:58.967
- Now we just have to pray

1140
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.767
that all these
clients actually show.

1141
00:48:02.867 --> 00:48:03.667
- They will.

1142
00:48:04.567 --> 00:48:07.000
(school bell ringing)

1143
00:48:07.133 --> 00:48:08.433
Work hard. you guys!

1144
00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:10.867
I don't know how much longer
I can take this chair.

1145
00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.133
- We start candygram
sales tomorrow.

1146
00:48:15.266 --> 00:48:16.500
- Yeah.

1147
00:48:16.633 --> 00:48:17.633
Bright and early.

1148
00:48:17.767 --> 00:48:18.900
- I look forward to it.

1149
00:48:24.033 --> 00:48:24.834
See you later.

1150
00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:39.533
(deep breathing)

1151
00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:41.900
- You seem to be spending
a lotta time together.

1152
00:48:43.967 --> 00:48:45.667
- It's just for work.

1153
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.467
- It's for the school.
for my daughter.

1154
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.533
- (chuckling) Yeah.

1155
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.266
- Maybe so.

1156
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.467
But you seem a lot
lighter this past week.

1157
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.967
even more so than when
you were with Adam.

1158
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.066
Maybe something's happening?
- Psh.

1159
00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:06.700
I mean. sure.

1160
00:49:06.834 --> 00:49:08.133
He's nice.

1161
00:49:08.266 --> 00:49:10.100
He's reliable.

1162
00:49:10.233 --> 00:49:11.333
He cares.

1163
00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:14.233
But I thought all of those
same things about Adam

1164
00:49:14.367 --> 00:49:15.567
when I first met him too.

1165
00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:19.967
- I'm just sayin'...

1166
00:49:22.033 --> 00:49:23.000
Open your mind.

1167
00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:26.200
- Maybe something's happening?

1168
00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:30.367
- She just broke up with
someone. in my restaurant.

1169
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.667
She needs more time.

1170
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.633
- (scoffing) Don't you
be making assumptions

1171
00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:35.233
about what she needs.

1172
00:49:35.367 --> 00:49:37.400
You like her. (giggling)

1173
00:49:37.533 --> 00:49:39.800
(deep breathing)

1174
00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:41.834
- I don't know. it
just feels too soon.

1175
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.967
- There is no timeline.

1176
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.600
And things were already
kind of ending with Adam

1177
00:49:48.734 --> 00:49:49.867
before you walked away.

1178
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.800
- My mind is open.

1179
00:49:50.934 --> 00:49:52.333
It's actually the first time

1180
00:49:52.467 --> 00:49:54.600
I've even entertained the
idea of dating since Eva.

1181
00:49:54.734 --> 00:49:55.533
But what if-

1182
00:49:56.867 --> 00:49:58.333
- What-ifs are futile!

1183
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:01.233
- What-ifs are preparation.
(Andrea groaning)

1184
00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:03.467
- It's just. I feel like
I created this fantasy

1185
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.900
in my love story with Adam.

1186
00:50:05.033 --> 00:50:07.867
and now I don't even
know what's real anymore.

1187
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.500
- Look. Ker. you
moved here for love.

1188
00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:12.767
Well. maybe that love
wasn't with Adam.

1189
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.200
Maybe it was with somebody else.

1190
00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:17.967
(both groaning)

1191
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.867
- Okay. and $3 is your change.

1192
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.433
- Just put the recipient's name

1193
00:50:22.567 --> 00:50:25.967
and class on the card provided
and put it in your box and...

1194
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.166
- (laughing) They don't care.

1195
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.100
Hi.

1196
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:29.900
- Thank you.

1197
00:50:31.934 --> 00:50:32.734
- Hi.

1198
00:50:32.867 --> 00:50:33.934
Five please.

1199
00:50:35.033 --> 00:50:35.834
- Five.

1200
00:50:37.166 --> 00:50:38.734
- Who are these for?
- Friends.

1201
00:50:38.867 --> 00:50:39.734
- Which friends?

1202
00:50:39.867 --> 00:50:40.934
- Don't worry about it.

1203
00:50:42.166 --> 00:50:43.233
- Here you go.

1204
00:50:43.367 --> 00:50:44.700
Oop. you okay?
- Yeah. thank you.

1205
00:50:50.567 --> 00:50:54.000
- Don't worry. they
can't all be for crushes.

1206
00:50:54.133 --> 00:50:55.266
- Am I that transparent?

1207
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:57.934
- Yeah.

1208
00:50:58.066 --> 00:51:00.600
- [David] We are definitely
going to need to order more.

1209
00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:02.633
- [Kerri] Wonderful.
more ribbons.

1210
00:51:02.767 --> 00:51:04.967
- Ah. more candy.

1211
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.166
You're looking at
this wrong. (laughing)

1212
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.100
(cell phone ringing)

1213
00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:10.500
Uh...

1214
00:51:10.633 --> 00:51:12.834
Gimme a second?
- Oh yeah. I can finish up.

1215
00:51:15.967 --> 00:51:16.767
- Eva.

1216
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.467
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1217
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.667
I'm not using her project
to promote my business.

1218
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.734
I'm allowing her to use my
business to promote her project.

1219
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:29.166
No. I am not gonna cancel!

1220
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.266
This means everything to her!

1221
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.367
Stop. E-

1222
00:51:34.233 --> 00:51:36.967
Stop; no. she's not
coming to Texas.

1223
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.367
Well. fine then.
you can come home.

1224
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.066
This move of yours was supposed
to be temporary anyway!

1225
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.266
That's what I thought.

1226
00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:44.734
Now. look. if you're
still there in the summer.

1227
00:51:44.867 --> 00:51:46.333
then maybe she can
come and visit Dallas.

1228
00:51:46.467 --> 00:51:49.900
but she's thriving for
the first time in a year.

1229
00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:53.734
She doesn't need any more
shakeups in her life.

1230
00:51:53.867 --> 00:51:54.767
Yeah.

1231
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.700
Bye.

1232
00:51:58.667 --> 00:52:03.200
(sighing)
(soft music)

1233
00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:04.633
Sorry.
- It's okay.

1234
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.500
Do you wanna grab a
coffee or a bite to eat?

1235
00:52:11.133 --> 00:52:13.300
And a bottle of wine? (laughing)

1236
00:52:13.433 --> 00:52:14.500
- Coffee sounds great.

1237
00:52:15.934 --> 00:52:17.266
Thank you.

1238
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.767
- You're welcome.

1239
00:52:44.633 --> 00:52:46.200
- So. I have something
I wanna tell you.

1240
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:48.233
I booked a trip to Veracruz
this summer for me and Clara.

1241
00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:50.500
- That's so great.

1242
00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:54.066
I'm glad you're finally
going. and Clara too.

1243
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.533
I hope you come back with
a thousand new recipes.

1244
00:52:56.667 --> 00:52:58.100
- Another thing I owe to you.

1245
00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:00.800
- You don't owe me anything.

1246
00:53:00.934 --> 00:53:03.633
- You walked into our lives
and set us both straight.

1247
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:06.100
- I was just doing what
anyone else would do.

1248
00:53:06.233 --> 00:53:07.934
throwing myself into
other people's business

1249
00:53:08.066 --> 00:53:09.967
so that I don't have
to deal with my own.

1250
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.100
- A fine coping
mechanism. I know it well.

1251
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:18.433
- So. my mother thinks that
I should move back home

1252
00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:19.600
after this semester.

1253
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.066
- [David] What do you think?

1254
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.400
- I don't know. I
think I'm just waiting

1255
00:53:25.533 --> 00:53:28.000
on some kind of
a sign. you know?

1256
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:29.533
Something that makes
it as clear as it was

1257
00:53:29.667 --> 00:53:32.967
when I first moved here.
but I'm coming up short.

1258
00:53:36.633 --> 00:53:38.200
- Well. I wish I could help you.

1259
00:53:39.567 --> 00:53:41.633
But I do know this:

1260
00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:42.800
If you leave.

1261
00:53:44.633 --> 00:53:48.133
there's gonna be a lot of us
being real sad to see you go.

1262
00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:52.333
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1263
00:53:55.633 --> 00:53:58.700
(light upbeat music)

1264
00:54:02.166 --> 00:54:04.767
- And as a reminder. I
need a full breakdown

1265
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.367
of your businesses by tomorrow

1266
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.400
so I can submit to
the competition.

1267
00:54:08.533 --> 00:54:10.266
Deadline is Friday.

1268
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.300
(knocking on door)

1269
00:54:12.433 --> 00:54:16.000
- Okay. everyone. five-minute
break for candygrams.

1270
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.934
(students chattering)

1271
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.800
- Got one for you. Miss Fox.

1272
00:54:27.333 --> 00:54:28.367
- For me?

1273
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.734
- [Vinnie] It's a
pretty interesting one.

1274
00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:32.834
(soft upbeat music)

1275
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:34.967
- So?

1276
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.367
Who's it from. Miss Fox?

1277
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.300
- You know. I think I'm
someone's favorite teacher.

1278
00:54:40.433 --> 00:54:42.367
(students groaning)

1279
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.667
All right. back to work.

1280
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.900
- Hey. Jane!

1281
00:54:51.033 --> 00:54:53.066
Just picking up PTA mail.

1282
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.734
- [Clara] "Meet me outside
the dance at 7 p.m."?

1283
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.867
- [David] Hey.

1284
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.367
Did you hear?
- Hey.

1285
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.367
- Candygram sales
have made enough money

1286
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.133
to pay for field trips
'til the end of the year.

1287
00:55:46.266 --> 00:55:47.300
- Wow.

1288
00:55:47.433 --> 00:55:48.967
Does that mean no more ribbons?

1289
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.967
- (laughing) No such luck.

1290
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.000
Demand is at an all-time high.

1291
00:55:53.133 --> 00:55:54.233
- Well...

1292
00:55:54.367 --> 00:55:56.400
I mean. the kids
do love them. so-

1293
00:55:56.533 --> 00:55:58.033
- Well. it's not just the kids.

1294
00:55:58.166 --> 00:56:01.934
I know adults around campus
who appreciate it too.

1295
00:56:02.066 --> 00:56:02.867
- Absolutely.

1296
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.967
I mean. it's nice to
know that someone cares.

1297
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.467
- Yeah; you know. it's
funny how a small gesture

1298
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.600
can kick up things that people
haven't felt in a while.

1299
00:56:14.266 --> 00:56:15.667
- Couldn't agree more.

1300
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.500
- [Clara] What are
you doing here?

1301
00:56:17.633 --> 00:56:18.934
- I. I was just leaving.

1302
00:56:19.066 --> 00:56:21.633
I dropped by to
pick up PTA mail.

1303
00:56:21.767 --> 00:56:23.967
- [Clara] You could've
gotten it at pick-up.

1304
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.300
- Yes. but I had to
meet with the treasurer

1305
00:56:26.433 --> 00:56:28.834
to get an accounting
of candygram sales.

1306
00:56:28.967 --> 00:56:30.100
- Mm-hmm.

1307
00:56:30.233 --> 00:56:33.200
So. the event is now
36 people and counting.

1308
00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:36.567
Mom thinks it's crazy. but
I think it's a huge success.

1309
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.600
- Boy. that is a lot of
heart-shaped tortillas.

1310
00:56:38.734 --> 00:56:39.567
Can you believe I
let her convince me

1311
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.834
to make heart-shaped tortillas?

1312
00:56:40.967 --> 00:56:43.266
Do you have any idea how
time-consuming that is?

1313
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.166
- Dad. we have to do it.

1314
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.900
just like Abuela did in
Dia del Amor y Amistad.

1315
00:56:48.033 --> 00:56:51.333
Come on. it'll be
fun. like old times.

1316
00:56:51.467 --> 00:56:53.166
- Yeah. well. you're gonna
help me prep tonight.

1317
00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.667
- Can't. I have basketball.

1318
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.967
What about Andrea?

1319
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.633
- No. her sister's
kids are sick.

1320
00:56:58.767 --> 00:56:59.867
She has to help
take care of them.

1321
00:57:00.066 --> 00:57:01.533
I gave her the night off.

1322
00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:02.767
- I'm happy to help.

1323
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.133
- No. we couldn't ask you.

1324
00:57:04.266 --> 00:57:05.834
You've already done
so much already.

1325
00:57:05.967 --> 00:57:08.333
You have an entire
class to mentor.

1326
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.967
- Thank you. but. I mean.

1327
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.600
I've never made
heart-shaped tortillas

1328
00:57:12.734 --> 00:57:16.433
and I feel like that's a
skill I could really use. so-

1329
00:57:16.567 --> 00:57:19.834
- Oh; I know it's
generally your department.

1330
00:57:19.967 --> 00:57:22.900
but I am a pretty good teacher.

1331
00:57:23.033 --> 00:57:24.100
- Hmm.

1332
00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:25.266
We'll see about that.

1333
00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:27.033
- Okay.

1334
00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:28.133
Then it's settled.

1335
00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:30.200
Thanks. Miss Fox.

1336
00:57:30.333 --> 00:57:31.266
I owe you.

1337
00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.900
(soft upbeat music)

1338
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:34.567
- [David] "Okay.
then it's settled."

1339
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.834
(David and Kerri laughing)

1340
00:57:36.967 --> 00:57:38.667
- [Kerri] She knows
what she wants.

1341
00:57:40.133 --> 00:57:41.233
- [Marnie] Do you wanna
go to happy hour tonight?

1342
00:57:41.367 --> 00:57:42.567
- [Kerri] I can't
tonight. I'm sorry.

1343
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.200
- Let me guess.

1344
00:57:44.333 --> 00:57:48.166
You're helping David
Martinez solve world hunger.

1345
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.467
- (laughing) No.
I promised Clara

1346
00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.133
that I'd help her prep for
the Valentine's Day mixer.

1347
00:57:53.266 --> 00:57:54.567
- Oh.

1348
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.600
Are you giving all your
students this much attention?

1349
00:57:56.734 --> 00:57:59.133
- Yes. actually. I am.

1350
00:57:59.266 --> 00:58:01.400
which is why I look
so tired all the time.

1351
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.166
- Okay. maybe...

1352
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.967
Maybe you were right.

1353
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.300
Maybe moving here does have
more to offer than just Adam.

1354
00:58:11.433 --> 00:58:12.166
(Marnie gasping)

1355
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.667
- I knew it!

1356
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.467
You like David
Martinez! (laughing)

1357
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.567
I swear. that restaurant is
like a magical love portal.

1358

1395
01:00:31.567 --> 01:00:35.500
♪ Don't you know that there
ain't no mountain high enough ♪

1396
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.934
(soft music)

1397
01:00:38.066 --> 01:00:40.633
- Heart-shaped tortillas.
balloons that say "amore."

1398
01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:42.100
and she sent the mariachi band

1399
01:00:42.233 --> 01:00:44.800
a list of approved love songs.
(Kerri laughing)

1400
01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:46.700
- Well. she's giving it her all.

1401
01:00:46.834 --> 01:00:48.000
- She's a tyrant.

1402
01:00:48.133 --> 01:00:50.300
- I mean. the customer
is always right.

1403
01:00:50.433 --> 01:00:53.834
so be extra nice to her.
(David laughing)

1404
01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:55.867
- And if you put
oil on your hands.

1405
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.767
it keeps the dough
from crumbling up.

1406
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.867
- Another Abuela secret?

1407
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.066
- She had hundreds.

1408
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.300
I'd watch her cook for hours.
first at the taco stand

1409
01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:09.367
and then when my dad
got her this place.

1410
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.233
She loved to feed people.

1411
01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:14.900
- You're carrying
on a great legacy.

1412
01:01:17.433 --> 01:01:18.900
- You need flour now.

1413
01:01:19.033 --> 01:01:20.066
Way too much oil.

1414
01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.500
Get some; here.

1415
01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:23.700
You need to get it underneath.

1416
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.800
Get some oil on your hands.

1417
01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:27.266
You're starting to stick again.

1418
01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.533
- How many of these
do we have to make?

1419
01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:37.500
- A lot.
(soft piano music)

1420
01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:39.767
- We're gonna be here all night.

1421
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.467
- I could think of worse things.

1422
01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:54.100
(woman clearing throat)

1423
01:01:54.233 --> 01:01:56.166
- I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1424
01:01:57.033 --> 01:01:57.834
- Eva!

1425
01:02:03.867 --> 01:02:06.867
(cell phone ringing)

1426
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.800
- Marnie?

1427
01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:18.000
- [Marnie] Turn
on Channel 9. now.

1428
01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:19.767
- What?

1429
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.533
(blowing)

1430
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:24.967
- And my friend signed up

1431
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.433
for this Dia del Amor y
Amistad Valentine's Day event.

1432
01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:29.967
which is being put on by
a middle school matchmaker

1433
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.200
for a class project.

1434
01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:32.734
- She's 13.

1435
01:02:32.867 --> 01:02:35.500
- Well. I don't know; when I
was 13. I was pretty boy-crazy.

1436
01:02:35.633 --> 01:02:37.300
I think I could
make a good match.

1437
01:02:37.433 --> 01:02:40.200
- Come on. Misty. what does a
13-year-old know about love?

1438
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:41.667
(chuckling) No thank you.

1439
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.467
I'll stick to YouCanDateMe.com

1440
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.633
if I wanna find someone
completely incompatible.

1441
01:02:46.767 --> 01:02:47.800
- He's gonna kill me.

1442
01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.066
- Nobody watches "Good
Morning Seattle" anyway.

1443
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.467
- Everyone watches it.

1444
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.667
That's why we all
wanna win the award.

1445
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.166
- It doesn't matter.

1446
01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.500
I mean. if no one comes. if
everyone shows. who cares?

1447
01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:03.900
You've rocked this project
and I'm proud of you.

1448
01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:05.166
- I need it to work.

1449
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.667
but (pausing) not just that.

1450
01:03:14.967 --> 01:03:18.266
I think that someone might
be playing a trick on me.

1451
01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:22.533
(soft orchestral music)
- Why would you think that?

1452
01:03:22.667 --> 01:03:24.100
- I don't know.

1453
01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:27.300
I've never really thought
about dating and stuff.

1454
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.033
I mean. look at our family.

1455
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.400
- Clarita.

1456
01:03:36.633 --> 01:03:40.500
No. mama. what happened
between your mom and me.

1457
01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:43.400
that is not indicative
of your future.

1458
01:03:43.533 --> 01:03:44.600
I promise you that.

1459
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.700
Clarita.

1460
01:03:48.166 --> 01:03:51.867
You are going to make some
lucky guy so happy someday.

1461
01:03:54.066 --> 01:03:54.867
- You think?

1462
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.800
- I know.

1463
01:04:00.266 --> 01:04:03.166
As long as he's nice. decent.

1464
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.633
and you don't date
before you're 30.

1465
01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:05.633
- (laughing) Okay.

1466
01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:08.667
- But in all seriousness. mija.

1467
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.266
maybe you should give
this secret admirer

1468
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.600
the benefit of the doubt.

1469
01:04:14.967 --> 01:04:16.000
You never know who it could be

1470
01:04:16.133 --> 01:04:17.600
if you don't put
your heart out there.

1471
01:04:19.233 --> 01:04:20.700
- Thanks. Dad.
- I love you.

1472
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.533
Now. get in there.
you're getting wet!

1473
01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:39.033
- Oh. what timing
the ex-wife had!

1474
01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.533
- Tell me about it.

1475
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.066
I mean. no one even knew
that she was coming home.

1476
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.233
Between that and the "Good
Morning Seattle" segment.

1477
01:04:44.367 --> 01:04:46.233
the hits just keep coming.

1478
01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:48.000
- Have you talked
to David at all?

1479
01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:49.533
- No. he said we'd talk later.

1480
01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:52.367
But besides one text this
morning about the segment.

1481
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
it's pretty much
been radio silence.

1482
01:04:54.633 --> 01:04:58.200
- I'm sure they're just figuring
it out for Clara's sake.

1483
01:04:59.533 --> 01:05:02.000
- I just hope I didn't
steer Clara wrong.

1484
01:05:02.133 --> 01:05:03.600
She's so excited
about the party.

1485
01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:04.867
What if no one shows?

1486
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.233
- Well. you said it yourself:

1487
01:05:06.367 --> 01:05:08.400
It's about the execution.
not the success.

1488
01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:11.300
- Still. I don't wanna
break a 13-year-old's heart

1489
01:05:11.433 --> 01:05:13.033
on Valentine's Day.

1490
01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:14.667
- She's got the dance tonight.

1491
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.633
She'll be fine.

1492
01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.066
She'll forget all about it.

1493
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.533
Ugh.

1494
01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:20.867
Why are we doing this?

1495
01:05:23.567 --> 01:05:24.367
- Kerri!

1496
01:05:25.767 --> 01:05:27.633
Glad I caught you
before you left.

1497
01:05:27.767 --> 01:05:29.133
Can we talk for a second?

1498
01:05:29.266 --> 01:05:30.200
- Yeah. hop in.

1499
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.667
- Hi.

1500
01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.200
- Hi.

1501
01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:44.767
- I wanted to apologize for
the interruption last night.

1502
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.033
- Oh. you don't
need to apologize.

1503
01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:49.133
Family comes first.

1504
01:05:50.867 --> 01:05:52.834
How's Clara doing today?

1505
01:05:52.967 --> 01:05:55.333
- Oh. she's more concerned
about the dance tonight.

1506
01:05:55.467 --> 01:05:57.633
(laughing) Boy stuff.

1507
01:05:57.767 --> 01:06:00.100
- Right. sounds about
right for a 13-year-old.

1508
01:06:00.233 --> 01:06:01.767
- She really does want
that Innovation Award.

1509
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.100
- I mean. she
might still win it.

1510
01:06:04.233 --> 01:06:05.934
even if the event is a bust.

1511
01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:10.100
(soft piano music)

1512
01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:12.800
- Hey. that's not what I
wanted to talk to you about.

1513
01:06:14.734 --> 01:06:19.133
Our time last night. I enjoyed
it. interruption and all.

1514
01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:22.934
- I did too.

1515
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.900
- So. I...

1516
01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:31.734
I'll see you at
the event tomorrow.

1517
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.433
I hear it's the place to be
if you wanna make a match.

1518
01:06:36.567 --> 01:06:38.867
(Kerri laughing)

1519
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.934
- Yeah. I hear the same thing.

1520
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.967
- Bye.
- Bye.

1521
01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:51.133
(upbeat pop music)

1522
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:08.800
- Clara.

1523
01:07:10.934 --> 01:07:12.200
What are you doing out here?

1524
01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.133
- Oh. I was...

1525
01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:17.266
I was watching my
successful couples arrive.

1526
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.433
You two are the last.

1527
01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.700
- Well. come in with us.

1528
01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:45.300
(soft mariachi music)

1529
01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:50.734
(crowd chattering)

1530
01:08:50.867 --> 01:08:52.734
- Group three. one
table to the left.

1531
01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:55.300
Group two. one
table to the right.

1532
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.333
- And you were worried
no one was gonna show up.

1533
01:09:17.467 --> 01:09:20.266
- You were worried;
I was never worried.

1534
01:09:35.066 --> 01:09:37.200
(phone notification dinging)

1535
01:09:37.333 --> 01:09:40.133
(Kerri laughing)

1536
01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:43.233
(soft upbeat music)

1537
01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:57.033
(knocking on door)

1538
01:09:59.133 --> 01:10:00.166
- Miss Fox.

1539
01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.100
- Hi.

1540
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.900
I've got some really
great news for Clara.

1541
01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:07.333
She's one of the finalists
for the ABC project.

1542
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.767
- Oh.

1543
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.800
Do you usually make house
calls for all your students?

1544
01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.900
- No. I...

1545
01:10:15.033 --> 01:10:16.800
I was just really
excited to tell her.

1546
01:10:16.934 --> 01:10:19.533
I know she worked so hard and...

1547
01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:20.767
I mean. I was on my way home.

1548
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.000
so I just thought
I would stop by.

1549
01:10:22.133 --> 01:10:22.834
- Oh. I know.

1550
01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:25.033
We are so proud of her.

1551
01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:27.900
And we really appreciate
all you've done.

1552
01:10:28.033 --> 01:10:31.400
so I will happily
relay the message.

1553
01:10:31.533 --> 01:10:33.467
We're just in the
middle of family time.

1554
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.734
- Right.

1555
01:10:34.867 --> 01:10:36.533
I'm sorry. please
just let her know.

1556
01:10:39.633 --> 01:10:40.433
- [David] Kerri.

1557
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.834
- Clara's a finalist
for her project.

1558
01:10:44.967 --> 01:10:46.433
- Oh. wow.
- Miss Fox

1559
01:10:46.567 --> 01:10:48.200
wanted to let you know.

1560
01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:49.166
Isn't that sweet?

1561
01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:00.967
- So. Clara must be
so happy she's back.

1562
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.467
- She is. she is.

1563
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.800
Between project and Eva being
back. she's herself again.

1564
01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:13.300
Might be a bit confusing
for her if you and I-

1565
01:11:13.433 --> 01:11:15.600
- I was thinking the same thing.

1566
01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:19.200
You know. it's important that
there aren't too many changes

1567
01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:20.900
for Clara all at once.

1568
01:11:21.033 --> 01:11:23.400
- Yeah. just for a while.

1569
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:25.767
Sorry. Kerri.
- You don't need to apologize.

1570
01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.600
because I actually decided
that I'm going back to Oregon

1571
01:11:31.734 --> 01:11:35.734
when the school year's over;
you know. to be near family.

1572
01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:37.467
- Oh.

1573
01:11:38.367 --> 01:11:39.166
Okay.

1574
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.734
If (pausing) that's what's
gonna make you happy.

1575
01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:46.734
- It is.

1576
01:11:50.367 --> 01:11:53.567
- Well. you will be
very missed around here

1577
01:11:55.567 --> 01:11:56.333
by all of us.

1578
01:12:00.767 --> 01:12:01.800
- It's for the best.

1579
01:12:05.467 --> 01:12:10.033
Okay. well goodnight. and
please congratulate Clara for me

1580
01:12:11.633 --> 01:12:13.400
and tell her I'll
see her on Monday.

1581
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:15.900
- Will do.

1582
01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:19.900
- Goodnight.

1583
01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.633
- [David] Goodnight. Kerri.

1584
01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:44.133
c)

1585
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.934
- My press has already begun.

1586
01:12:47.066 --> 01:12:49.266
and I am not counting a "Good
Morning Seattle" segment

1587
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.767
where they doubted me.

1588
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.033
- And we haven't even heard
about the district awards yet.

1589
01:12:53.166 --> 01:12:55.367
- You know. I don't
really care about that.

1590
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.867
Feels like I already won.

1591
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.367
My mom is home.

1592
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.166
my dad's happier than I've
seen him in a long time.

1593
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.467
Things are good.

1594
01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.100
- I'm really happy for you.

1595
01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:06.667
And although I don't know
much about the other schools.

1596
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.567
I think you have a pretty good
shot at the Innovation Award.

1597
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.400
- I guess we'll
find out tomorrow.

1598
01:13:18.834 --> 01:13:20.967
- You can't leave!
(Kerri laughing)

1599
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.433
You make all of our lives better

1600
01:13:22.567 --> 01:13:25.700
and then you selfishly
take it all away from us?

1601
01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.400
- You'll be fine.

1602
01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:28.433
You have Gavin now.

1603
01:13:28.567 --> 01:13:30.500
You'll live happily ever after

1604
01:13:30.633 --> 01:13:32.300
and you'll forget all about me.

1605
01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:34.066
- Not possible.

1606
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.200
- Maybe this was just a
learning experience. you know?

1607
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.300
Maybe I'm not supposed
to take so many risks

1608
01:13:43.433 --> 01:13:45.233
with my personal life.

1609
01:13:45.367 --> 01:13:48.734
I'm just. I'm glad it ended
before I got in too deep.

1610
01:13:49.867 --> 01:13:51.467
- Your risks
weren't for nothing.

1611
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.867
You don't have to run.

1612
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.867
(soft piano music)
- I'm not running.

1613
01:14:00.567 --> 01:14:02.266
(sighing)

1614
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.633
Okay. maybe I'm
running a little bit.

1615
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.100
(sighing)

1616
01:14:08.233 --> 01:14:13.133
I was just looking (pausing)
for a concrete sign.

1617
01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.967
a reason to stay.

1618
01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:19.166
And I found the opposite.

1619
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.667
- [Clara] Mom's not joining us?

1620
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.300
- No. she's actually
looking for an apartment.

1621
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.433
a two-bedroom so
you can stay there.

1622
01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:47.266
Look. mija. I know that you're
happy you're mother's back.

1623
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.800
but she and I are
just gonna be friends.

1624
01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:53.400
I know that's hard for you
to hear. but I'm sorry.

1625
01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:56.800
- I'm Cupid Clara. Dad.

1626
01:14:56.934 --> 01:14:59.166
I know when people are
right for each other

1627
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.667
and when they're not.
(David laughing)

1628
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.734
- Of course you do.

1629
01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.800
- I'm happy Mom is back. but
you two are so not a match.

1630
01:15:06.934 --> 01:15:09.000
I knew that long
before you even did.

1631
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.633
But I happen to know who
is your perfect match.

1632
01:15:13.767 --> 01:15:15.066
- Is that right?

1633
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.834
- Think you just
need a little help.

1634
01:15:17.967 --> 01:15:20.233
(soft orchestral music)

1635
01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:22.734
- Wait. you were
my secret admirer?

1636
01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:25.033
- Think of it as
a proxy for her.

1637
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:26.834
- Proxy. (laughing)

1638
01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:28.333
That's good vocab word usage.

1639
01:15:28.467 --> 01:15:31.100
- Of course. I'm doing very
well in school know. you know.

1640
01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:32.300
- I know. Cupid Clara.

1641
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.867
I know.
(glasses clinking)

1642
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.700
(soft pop music)

1643
01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:44.266
- Hi.

1644
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.100
Hey!

1645
01:15:46.233 --> 01:15:47.033
Hey.

1646
01:15:48.967 --> 01:15:49.767
Hey. guys!

1647
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.533
Listen. good luck tonight. okay?

1648
01:15:52.667 --> 01:15:54.266
I have a really good

1649
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.767
is gonna come out
of our classroom.

1650
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.533
- Miss Fox. you
know Bink and Misty

1651
01:15:59.667 --> 01:16:00.667
from "Good Morning Seattle"?

1652
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.467
They're here. recording.

1653
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.767
Right there.

1654
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.734
- Mowing lawns for
all of his neighbors.

1655
01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:08.500
Are you enjoying that. Riley?

1656
01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:10.133
- That's a really good sign.
- I know!

1657
01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:11.834
(both laughing)

1658
01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.467
- We should probably
get to our seats.

1659
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.166
Good luck.
- Okay.

1660
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.166
I'll see ya later.

1661
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.433

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.934
please join me in welcoming
Superintendent Weaver.

1664

Competition Award.

I've seen in my 22-year career.

in the district.

And now. it's time for the

Every single nominee hit it out
of the park on this project.

You are all winners.

That being said. the

for this year's Innovation
Award in our district...

1679
01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.367
A rather...

1680
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.867
A rather unusual
business venture.

1681
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.500

I'm really proud of you.

- You know that makeover
you were talking about?

1694
01:17:57.433 --> 01:17:58.767
- Oh. the classroom make-

1695
01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.367
Clara. I was just joking.

1696
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.600
- Well. you deserve it. and
I wanted to do this for you.

1697
01:18:03.967 --> 01:18:05.166
Ta-da!

1698

- You guys!
(audience oohing)

1699
01:18:06.533 --> 01:18:09.133
- A brand new desk and
chair. top of the line.

with extra lumbar
support. just for you.

- You guys. thank
you. (laughing)

1702
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.734
Should I sit in the chair?

1703
01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:18.500
- Yeah!
- Yeah; okay.

1704
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.934
- You like it?

1705
01:18:21.066 --> 01:18:21.867
- It's perfect.

1706
01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.400

For you. (laughing)

1711

I know you were just
joking. but David Martinez

1712
01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:44.033
and Clara's mother. Eva.
wanted to do this for you.

1713
01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:45.867
They coordinated everything.

1714
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.133
(audience applauding)

1715
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.967
Did you really wanna
leave all this behind?

1716
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.066
- Thank you.

1717
01:19:23.367 --> 01:19:25.333
- [Clara] Thank you.
I'll see you later.

1718
01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:28.066
Oh. hi.

1719
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.834
- I'd like to
order my match now.

1720
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.734
But I don't really care
who it is. unless it's you.

1721
01:19:35.867 --> 01:19:37.867
(soft piano music)

1722
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.767
- Are you (pausing)
my secret admirer?

1723
01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:43.367
- Yeah.

1724
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.900
I'm sorry. I chickened
out on going to the dance.

1725
01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:49.166
I was just thinking
about how much you risked

1726
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:53.066
with your project. so I
thought that I'd take one too.

1727
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.934
- Okay. and we did match.

1728
01:19:56.066 --> 01:19:58.800
- (laughing) I thought so.

1729
01:19:58.934 --> 01:19:59.734
- So...

1730
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.867
What now?

1731
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.600
I mean. I only know
how to make the match.

1732
01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:06.867
I don't really know
what comes after.

1733
01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:12.900
- Well. would you like to
come and see a movie with me

1734
01:20:13.033 --> 01:20:14.567
on Saturday night?

1735
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.467
- Yeah. I'd like that.

1736
01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.333
- [Trevor] Okay. cool.

1737
01:20:18.467 --> 01:20:19.767
Well. see ya then.

1738

I thought you were
my secret admirer.

1763

- That kid. (laughing)

1765
01:22:16.633 --> 01:22:17.800

1766
01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:18.900
- She really is.

1767
01:22:21.166 --> 01:22:23.233
- But I will continue
to keep my distance

1768
01:22:23.367 --> 01:22:24.300
so it's not weird for her.

1769
01:22:24.433 --> 01:22:25.433

- No.

1770
01:22:26.633 --> 01:22:27.433
Please don't.

01:22:28.533 --> 01:22:29.433
Nobody wants that.

I know that you've
decided to go back home.

1773
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.967

I mean. did you
see my new chair?

1779
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.033
If that's not a sign.
I don't know what is.

1780
01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:08.166
- I picked that chair.
- Hmm.

1781
01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.800
