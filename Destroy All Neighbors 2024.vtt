00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:18.517
Don't do that!

4
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.864
What the fuck?
- It's good.

5
00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:23.833
What are you working on?
- Bridge for catapult tactics.

6
00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.318
Oh. nice. Didn't you already
do a bridge for that one?

7
00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:28.217
Yeah. but then I made
a second bridge.

8
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.460
and then I realized
I needed a third bridge to...

9
00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:32.773
- Bridge the bridges.
- Bridges. Yes. Yeah. yeah.

10
00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:35.155
Yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
Can you play me a little bit?

11
00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:36.811
Okay. Yeah.

12
00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:42.162
Nice. Nice.

13
00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:45.061
- You like it?
- Yeah. I think it's cool.

14
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.890
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:49.652
Maybe just. um-- maybe just
turn it down a little bit

16
00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:52.482
since. you know.
we got neighbors.
- Ah. yes. Yeah.

17
00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:55.313
Don't want to. uh. ruin
their good time

18
00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.487
with my amazing
groove session. right?

19
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.284
But you know who you
should share it with is Scott.

20
00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:02.699
You know?

21
00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.322
Yeah. I don't know.

22
00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.462
It's just Scott doesn't like
that kind of music.

23
00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:07.946
And I'm just an engineer there.

24
00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.811
I'm basically a glorified
knob twirler. if anything.

25
00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:12.433
Oh.

26
00:03:12.537 --> 00:03:16.575
Well. Mr. Knob Twirler.
maybe you could twirl my knobs.

27
00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.336
Oh. I thought you said
your knobs

28
00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.476
were too sensitive to twirl.

29
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.374
I was just trying to find
an elegant way

30
00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:25.791
to get into a groove with you.
- Oh.

31
00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:30.210
What time is it?
- Mm. 8:30.

32
00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:31.728
It's 8:30? I'm gonna be late
for work.

33
00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:33.213
Why didn't you tell me
it was 8:30?

34
00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.525
- God. you're a grownup.
- Where's my keys

35
00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.700
and my wallet and my phone?
- On the table.

36
00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:40.841
on the desk. and in your pocket.
- Okay. great.

37
00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:42.946
- Here's your go-go juice.
- Thank you so much.

38
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.845
Oh. and. uh. don't forget
the printer paper.

39
00:03:44.948 --> 00:03:46.950
Printer paper. Yes. I got it.
Yeah. I love you. Mwah.

40
00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:49.884
S-Sorry.

41
00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:53.612
Oh. sorry.
Sorry. Morning.

42
00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:23.332
- William!

43
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.437
Can I borrow you for a second?

44
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.750
Hoo-ooh-ooh!

45
00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:31.719
I told him. "If you make love
as good as you dance.

46
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:35.413
then. hey. baby. you can
light my fire anytime."

47
00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:37.380
Ha ha ha.
Super funny. Eleanor.

48
00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:38.761
Now. remember. when it goes out.

49
00:04:38.864 --> 00:04:40.210
you wanna make sure
these wires are attached.

50
00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:42.282
and you can flip this up.

51
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:44.318
And it should...
Great. Got it.

52
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.804
You really gotta get
a professional in here. okay?

53
00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:50.773
Oh. come on. Why should I hire
an electrician when I have you?

54
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.913
Because you're the building
manager. It's your job.

55
00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:55.329
And I don't think anything I'm
doing in there is legal or safe.

56
00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:58.263
Listen. I got
something for your album.

57
00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.989
I really appreciate it.
Eleanor. but. uh.

58
00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:01.370
I don't think you're
the intended audience

59
00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:03.682
for my kind of music. okay?

60
00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:06.029
- Oh. William. one more thing.
- Hmm?

61
00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:08.825
Eleanor. it's not broken.

62
00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:10.379
You just need
to charge it. okay?

63
00:05:10.482 --> 00:05:12.967
I don't know how to work
these new vibrators.

64
00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:14.417
It's a toothbrush.
Oh. hey.

65
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:15.832
Hey. what's up brother?

66
00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:17.351
Hey. Alec. what's going on?
You moving out?

67
00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:19.353
Yeah. Finally sold
that screenplay.

68
00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.424
- Oh. the sci-fi one.
- The erotic sci-fi thriller.

69
00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:24.703
- Yeah. Hmm.
- Yeah. Finally out of
this shitty cursed apartment.

70
00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:26.602
No more leaky pipes.
power outages.

71
00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:28.500
weird pets running around.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:30.019
Hey. how's that band going?

73
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:31.572
Uh. it's mainly me these days.

74
00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:33.298
Uh. actually.
can I ask you something?

75
00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.196
- Yeah.
- How'd you do it?

76
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.613
- Do what?
- How'd you finish the script?

77
00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:40.581
It's all about mindset.
all right? No distractions.

78
00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:43.550
- No distractions.
- Plus. I didn't really
have to work a job.

79
00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:44.792
- Why's that?
- A trust fund.

80
00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:46.587
- Ah.
- Yeah. But mainly hard work.

81
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:48.486
- Yeah.
- And some help
from my dad's buddy

82
00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:49.797
who wrote a couple
of "Jurassic Parks."

83
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:51.316
- Cool.
- That's why a major studio's

84
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.318
finally making
my erotic sci-fi thriller.

85
00:05:53.422 --> 00:05:55.596
Oh! Oh!

86
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.218

87
00:05:57.322 --> 00:06:00.463
Pig guy's pig
is out again!

88
00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:02.914
Oh. William.

155
00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:04.889
- I'm gonna hit the slopes. man.
- Doing drugs is not

156
00:09:04.992 --> 00:09:07.270

Um. you know what?
We got a minute.

Would you mind. uh. if I got
your opinion on something?

Yeah. For sure. Yeah.

Um. it's. uh. it's something
I've been working on at home.

166

It's. uh. it's called "Epitaph
for the Fallen Circus."

167
00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:46.724
It's kind of like
a progressive form of prog.

168
00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:49.450
I've been calling it.
uh. a prog squared.

169
00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:52.143
Oh. yeah. Yeah. it sounds
like Emerson

170
00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:54.317
getting butt fucked
by Lincoln Palmer.

171
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.112
Am I right. Scott?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:56.216 --> 00:09:59.322
'Cause I was literally just
about to say how much it sucks.

173
00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:02.636
And don't play it here again.
or you're fired.

174
00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:06.709
Well. grog's
not for everybody. okay?

175
00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.469
You know. it's-- it's kind of
an auditory labyrinth.

176
00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.575
I actually like that
it takes a long time
to get into it.

177
00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:13.820
Some of my favorite albums--
- Let me ask you a question.
my guy.

178
00:10:13.923 --> 00:10:18.963
Why do you think I am in there
and you are in here?

179
00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:21.690
'Cause you got a song
on this soundtrack for the O.C.

180
00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:24.658
It's because I know what people
want from their music.

181
00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:27.799
Still. fuck! The fuck?!
The fuck?!

182
00:10:27.903 --> 00:10:29.732
Get the fuck off me.

183
00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:32.977
My music makes people
make babies.

184
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.496
The only way I'd listen
to your shitty music...

185
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.189
♪ Is if you tied me up
at gunpoint ♪

186
00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:41.882
♪ And you forced me to

187
00:10:41.986 --> 00:10:44.471
Right on. Uh. you ready to
do another take. Mr. Bang--

188
00:10:44.574 --> 00:10:45.748
Caleb-- Caleb--
Caleb Bang Jansen?

189
00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:48.717
Caleb Bang Ja-a-a-nsen!

190
00:10:50.028 --> 00:10:53.238
Oh. shit!
That was speed!

191
00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:55.758
Oh. we're going to be here
all day. boys!

192
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.073
Toot-toot!

193
00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:08.150
Hey. man.
where's that croissant?

194
00:11:08.253 --> 00:11:09.530
Oh. Uh. I'm sorry.

195
00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:11.256
We didn't really have
any today. so...

196
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.362
Come on!

197
00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.640
You're the croissant guy!

198
00:11:15.744 --> 00:11:17.607
You're always
handing out croissants.

199
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.368
Give it up. croissant guy.
- Auggie.

200
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.991
I gave you a croissant once.
like. a month ago.

201
00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:24.856
But time is an illusion. motherfucker.

202
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.135
- Yeah. I fucking wish it was.
- You're headed into chaos.

203
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:32.484
Don't listen to the voices
in your head.

204
00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:34.901
Blood will be spilled.

205
00:11:35.004 --> 00:11:37.075
Heads will roll.
- What?

206
00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:41.045
Soon you will be visited
by three ghosts.

207
00:11:41.148 --> 00:11:44.082
Oh. fuck off. Auggie.
I'll see you tomorrow.

208
00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.739
You there. boy!

209
00:11:45.843 --> 00:11:48.880
Go find me the fattest goose
you can get.

210
00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:51.193
And then fuck it!

211
00:12:54.739 --> 00:12:56.430
What's going on?

212
00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:01.297
I think we have a new neighbor.

213
00:13:08.408 --> 00:13:10.168
Jesus Christ.

214
00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:14.069
I mean. how long is he gonna
be moving around furniture?

215
00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:17.037
Oh. did you remember
to get the printer paper?

216
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:19.315
Oh.
Shit. I'm sorry.

217
00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:21.455
- Oh. it's okay.
- No. I'll get it--
I can get it tomorrow.

218
00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:24.044
Or just. uh...
- It's okay. Don't worry.
I still got a little bit.

219
00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:26.046
So...
- Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Thank you.

220
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.945
Is everything okay?

221
00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:31.017
No. I don't know.
I just--

222
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.641
I played a song for Scott today.

223
00:13:34.744 --> 00:13:36.746
And it seemed like he liked it.

224
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.301
And then Caleb Bang Jansen came
in and just started shitting

225
00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:43.236
all over it and just. like...
- Aw. You know what?

226
00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:45.514
Fuck him.

227
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.275
Do you remember what your father
used to say?

228
00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:51.831
Said.
"Everyone won't get it. but..."

229
00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:53.487
Not everyone will get it.
but the right ones will.

230
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:56.766
Right ones will. Hmm?
Yeah.

231
00:13:58.251 --> 00:14:00.287
Do you want to go to sleep?

232
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:03.635
No. I'm gonna just see if this
guy stops making so much racket

233
00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:05.810
and then see if I can
get some work done.
- Sure. Okay.

234
00:14:05.914 --> 00:14:08.261
- Yeah.
- I mean. try to be in soon.
I got an early morning.

235
00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:09.987
Yeah. I know. it just--
Is this sound--

236
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.402
Is this not bugging you?
It's just so loud.

237
00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.507
Do you get some earplugs
just in case?

238
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:16.786
No. I can't. You know.
I got the small ear canals.

239
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.616
Just...

240
00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:20.894
Go to sleep.

241
00:14:28.453 --> 00:14:31.111
Fucking A! I mean.
what is up with this guy?

242
00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:33.527
Look. if it's bothering you
that much. Will.

243
00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:35.184
just-- just go over there.

244
00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:37.393
- I can't just go over there.
- Why not?

245
00:14:37.497 --> 00:14:40.534
Because I don't want
a confrontation.

246
00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:43.192
Maybe we should call the cops.
- Oh. my God. I will
go over there.

247
00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:45.056
No. no. no. no. Don't. don't.
don't. don't. don't.

248
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.989
I'll just-- I'll just. uh--
I'll just pound on the wall.

249
00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:49.060
- With your fist?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:50.890
That's a little archaic.
don't you think?

251
00:14:50.993 --> 00:14:52.374
You're not a caveman.
- I--

252
00:14:52.477 --> 00:14:54.307
Yeah. but what else-- I just--
You know. it's late.

253
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.343
I don't want to go over there
if he's just--

254
00:14:57.966 --> 00:15:00.865
I'm sorry.
Good night.

255
00:15:00.969 --> 00:15:02.660
If it's not bugging you.
you can go sleep.

256
00:15:02.763 --> 00:15:05.870
Put some earplugs into
my normal-sized ear holes.

257
00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:07.665
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

258
00:15:17.019 --> 00:15:20.505
Oh. William! What a delight.

259
00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:22.576
Hey. we were just about
to watch a movie.

260
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.889
Eleanor. whoever you rented
Alec's apartment out to

261
00:15:24.993 --> 00:15:26.408
is making a ton of noise.

262
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:28.548
So if you could please
just tell him to keep it down.

263
00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:30.791
Why don't you just tell him
yourself? He's your neighbor.

264
00:15:30.895 --> 00:15:32.207
No. but you're
the building manager.

265
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.485
It's your job.
- Eleanor! Come back!

266
00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:36.349
Sophie's about
to make her choice.

267
00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:38.247
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

268
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:40.801
So if you don't mind. I got
to get back to movie night.

269
00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:44.288
No. but it's your job to settle
quarrels between tenants.

270
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.931
No. no. no. Fuck!

271
00:16:56.705 --> 00:16:59.466
What the fuck?

272
00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:03.263
Emily! Emily! Emily. wake up!
Wake up! I fucked up!

273
00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:05.265
- Oh. What happened?
- I pounded on the wall.

274
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.819
- Wait. you did what?
- I know. but he came up
to our door.

275
00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:09.752
and he hocked a loogie.
You got to see this guy.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

276
00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:12.307
- He's a fucking monster.
He just looks so messed up.
- What?

277
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.171
I think we're living next
to some kind of maniac.

278
00:17:14.274 --> 00:17:17.691
Okay. okay. okay.
Well. the music just stopped.

279
00:17:17.795 --> 00:17:19.866
It sounds like he got it
out of his system. okay?

280
00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:21.971
We can just deal with it
in the morning.

281
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.322
I'm calling the cops.

282
00:17:32.465 --> 00:17:34.432
I still don't know
what took you guys so long.

283
00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:35.951
Well. you didn't
have to wait outside.

284
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.573
Yeah. well. I don't
hear any noise now.

285
00:17:37.677 --> 00:17:39.575
Well. yeah. but still.
he hocked a loogie on my door.

286
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:41.681
That's. like. assault. right?
- A loogie?

287
00:17:41.784 --> 00:17:43.993
- Yeah. on my door.
- How do you spell that?

288
00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.823
- I don't know.

289
00:17:45.926 --> 00:17:47.238
Emily!

290
00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:49.102
Emily!

291
00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:51.829
- Emily?
- William.

292
00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.763
Emily was just about to tell me
about your trip to Big Bear.

293
00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.800
Oh. it's a long story.
We don't have time.

294
00:17:57.904 --> 00:18:01.839
We'd be here all night.
- Yes. Laughing. I'm sure.

295
00:18:01.942 --> 00:18:03.979
Oh! Hello. officers.

296
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.671
Can I interest you
in some chamomile tea?

297
00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:09.226
- Yeah. sure.
- It's cool. Please. come in.

298
00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:11.090
Please.
- No. no. no. no. no.
this is the guy.

299
00:18:11.193 --> 00:18:12.539
this-- this-- this thing.

300
00:18:12.643 --> 00:18:14.265
- William.
- He kept me up all night.

301
00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:16.025
He kept <i>us</i> up all night.

302
00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:18.097
Mr.?
- Vlad.

303
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.719
Just Vlad.

304
00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:21.583
Mr. Vlad. is there a reason
why you're making so much noise?

305
00:18:21.686 --> 00:18:23.895
- Why did you let him in?
- Well. I just moved in.

306
00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:27.036
And when you pounded
on the wall. I just--
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

307
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.073
You pounded on his wall?
- Yeah. b--

308
00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:30.799
- With your fist?
- Yeah.

309
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:33.181
You seem to have left
that little detail out.

310
00:18:33.284 --> 00:18:35.321
Sure. but--

311
00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:40.119
He spit on the door.
- The hocked loogie?

312
00:18:40.222 --> 00:18:43.846
- Yes. The hocked loogie.
- You know. William.
Vlad is sorry.

313
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.194
I brewed up a kettle of tea
to say. "Forgive me

314
00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:47.954
for what I have done
or might do."

315
00:18:48.057 --> 00:18:49.507
Wait. what do you mean.
might do?

316
00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:50.853
Oh! Oh!

317
00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:58.482
Oh. Emily. you didn't tell me
that William is so funny!

318
00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:02.002
To-go cups okay. officers?
- Thanks.

319
00:19:02.106 --> 00:19:03.383
- Yeah.
- I think we're done here.

320
00:19:03.487 --> 00:19:04.867
No. I don't think
we're done here.

321
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:07.111
I said I heard screaming
coming from his apartment.

322
00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:08.388
Aren't you going to
check his apartment?

323
00:19:08.492 --> 00:19:09.734
Yeah. it's probably my TV.

324
00:19:09.838 --> 00:19:11.426
but-- but you can have a look. officers.

325
00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:13.807
I take you over.
Please.

326
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:16.258
No. I don't think we need to.

327
00:19:16.362 --> 00:19:18.295
Uh. good night. Mr. Vlad.

328
00:19:18.398 --> 00:19:20.676
Night. ma'am.

329
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.437
Good night. officers.

330
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.819
Thank you so much
for understanding. Emily.

331
00:19:25.923 --> 00:19:29.202
Oh. you sweet thing.

332
00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:30.652
You fucker!

333
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.726
Yes. Good night

334
00:19:35.829 --> 00:19:37.969
- Good night.

335
00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:43.147
It's too bad you called
the cops like a little bitch.

336
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:45.908
If you had come to my apartment
like a man

337
00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:50.741
and told me face-to-face
to turn it down. who knows.

338
00:19:50.844 --> 00:19:55.435
maybe we would have had
a good old-fashioned rumble.

339
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.440
You bloody...

340
00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:28.434
Let me ask you a question.
my guy.

341
00:20:28.537 --> 00:20:31.713
Why do you think
I am in there

342
00:20:31.816 --> 00:20:33.715
and you are in here?

343
00:20:33.818 --> 00:20:34.819
You failed.

344
00:20:34.923 --> 00:20:36.131
Why don't you just tell him
yourself?

345
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.857
He's your neighbor.

346
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.479
You failed.

347
00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:42.171
Time is an illusion. motherfucker.

348
00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:46.314
No distractions.

349
00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:47.867
Did you remember printer paper?

350
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.109
No distractions.

351
00:20:49.213 --> 00:20:50.939
Time is an illusion. motherfucker.

352
00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.148
It's because I know what people
want from their music.

353
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.943
No distractions.

354
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.151
Fuck!

355
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.877
- Darren?
- Did you remember printer paper?

356
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.878
Fuck!

357
00:20:58.981 --> 00:21:00.466
Darren?

358
00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:01.639
Fuck!

359
00:21:02.985 --> 00:21:03.917
Fuck!

360
00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:05.022
The hocked loogie?

361
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:06.161
Fuck!

362
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.162
The hocked loogie?

363
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.474
Fuck!

364
00:21:08.577 --> 00:21:09.509
- The hocked loogie?
- Fuck!

365
00:21:09.613 --> 00:21:11.511
- The fuck!

366
00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:13.858
The fuck! The fuck!

367
00:21:13.962 --> 00:21:17.206
The fuck! The fuck!
The fuck! The fuck!

368
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.002
The fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

369
00:21:20.106 --> 00:21:23.074
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

370
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.836
No distractions.

371
00:21:25.939 --> 00:21:27.769
<i>Distractions.</i>

372
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:16.576
This-- The fuck is--

373
00:22:47.642 --> 00:22:49.713
Hey. I drew a dick
on your head

374
00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:51.611
because you're a dickhead.

375
00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:54.890
Also. you're fucking fired.

376
00:22:54.994 --> 00:22:56.098
What?

377
00:22:56.202 --> 00:22:58.377
No. You can't fire me.
I work for the studio.

378
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.206
Get the fuck out. William!

379
00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:02.381
What?

380
00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:04.831
Get the fuck out. William!
You heard the guy.

381
00:23:04.935 --> 00:23:06.315
Come on. dickhead.

382
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.559
Fucking whatever.

383
00:23:12.114 --> 00:23:13.806
- Croissant guy!
- Fuck.

384
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:16.291
- You got--
- I don't have
any fucking croissants. Auggie.

385
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:20.053
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's not my job
to feed you. alright?

386
00:23:20.157 --> 00:23:21.469
Oh. it's begun.

387
00:23:21.572 --> 00:23:22.780
Oh. fuck off!

388
00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:26.646
Innocence has been torn off
the meek!

389
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:31.824
Who shall beget
the calamities of castle!

390
00:23:31.927 --> 00:23:34.378
- Fuck off!

391
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:46.425
Damn. That is one hot lick.

392
00:23:46.528 --> 00:23:49.186
Listen up. There's gonna be
a lot of obstacles

393
00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:50.670
that pop up in your life--

394
00:23:50.774 --> 00:23:53.949
record executives.
ex-wives. sisters.

395
00:23:54.053 --> 00:23:58.471
These people are just roadblocks
on your journey to success.

396
00:23:58.575 --> 00:24:00.887
You got to stand
on your own two feet

397
00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:03.303
and say
my music is more important

398
00:24:03.407 --> 00:24:05.478
than your record sales
or your alimony

399
00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:09.068
or your paying
for our dumb dad's funeral.

400
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:11.277
You got to cut these people
out of your life

401
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.521
and tell them
to fuck off forever!

402
00:24:13.624 --> 00:24:14.901
Fuck off forever.

403
00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:16.351
Fuck off forever!

404
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.732
Fuck off forever.

405
00:24:17.835 --> 00:24:20.389
Get out of my kitchen.
'cause I'm cooking!

406
00:24:21.874 --> 00:24:23.634
Alright. Let's get back

407
00:24:23.738 --> 00:24:26.050
into the subtle art
of the pick slide.

408
00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:31.987
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

409
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:34.058
Um. they. uh--
They let me go--

410
00:24:34.162 --> 00:24:36.371
Early. They-- They let me--
They let me go early today.

411
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.890
Oh.

412
00:24:37.993 --> 00:24:40.582
Did you remember
to grab the printer paper?

413
00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:43.274
Shit. I'm sorry. Emily.
I forgot.

414
00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:45.345
- Ah.
- No. I'm sorry. You--

415
00:24:45.449 --> 00:24:46.588
You just--
You know I'm not good

416
00:24:46.692 --> 00:24:47.693
at keeping track
of that kind of shit.

417
00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:49.488
You mean you're not good

418
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:51.697
at keeping track of my shit.
- No.

419
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.837
Just-- I've just been--

420
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.528
I haven't been sleeping well.

421
00:24:55.632 --> 00:24:57.047
and Vlad's music
is fucking nonstop.

422
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.807
I can't believe
it's not bugging you.

423
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:00.015
It's just driving me crazy.

424
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:01.500
Okay. listen to me.
Listen to me.

425
00:25:01.603 --> 00:25:03.053
If it's so difficult
with Vlad's music.

426
00:25:03.156 --> 00:25:05.883
I will just go over there.
and I will speak to him.

427
00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:07.678
No. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no!

428
00:25:07.782 --> 00:25:09.300
I don't want you over there.
I don't want him over here.

429
00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:10.957
Listen. I am sorry.

430
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:13.960
I will be more present. and I
will remember the printer paper.

431
00:25:14.064 --> 00:25:15.824
Just--
Just once I finish this album.

432
00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:17.723
then I will be able
to get that stuff--

433
00:25:17.826 --> 00:25:22.969
You have been trying to finish
this album for three years.

434
00:25:23.073 --> 00:25:25.385
and-- and-- and you haven't
gotten anywhere close.

435
00:25:25.489 --> 00:25:28.078
You know. you-- you act like
this hobby is more important

436
00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:29.873
than everything else
in your life.

437
00:25:29.976 --> 00:25:31.391
My hobby?

438
00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:33.014
What do you think
all this stuff is?

439
00:25:33.117 --> 00:25:34.533
Music is like my life.

440
00:25:34.636 --> 00:25:37.259
If you don't like my music.
then what do you like about me?

441
00:25:37.363 --> 00:25:38.640
What do I like about you?

442
00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:41.091
Right now I don't know.

443
00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:43.507
Look. I-I'm gonna go grab
the printer paper.

444
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:44.991
I'll-- I'll see you later.

445
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.170
Shit.

446
00:26:10.638 --> 00:26:11.984
...this!

447
00:26:58.237 --> 00:27:01.481
What are you doing
in my tableau?

448
00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:03.311
- Um--
- Super invasive. bro.

449
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:06.107
You can't just walk into
somebody's home uninvited.

450
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.833
I'm sorry. but you said
man-to-man the other night.

451
00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:09.179
No. no. Vlad. I'm sorry.

452
00:27:09.282 --> 00:27:10.767
I-I'll leave. I'm-- I'm sorry.

453
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.285
I didn't mean to--
Vlad. Vlad. please.

454
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:14.287
I'm sorry!
- Chicken?

455
00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:19.499
Oh. it's so good.
You want a bite?

456
00:27:19.603 --> 00:27:21.191
- No. I'm fine.
- You sure?

457
00:27:21.294 --> 00:27:22.295
Yeah. yeah. I'm good.

458
00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.677
- Very tasty.
- Yeah.

459
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:26.230
Have a seat.

460
00:27:30.994 --> 00:27:34.100
Pretty ballsy.
just walking in here.

461
00:27:34.204 --> 00:27:37.345
considering you don't know
anything about me. eh?

462
00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:44.766
You got to be careful with all
the crazies around here. hmm?

463
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.631
Uh. just. uh. it'd be really...

464
00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:49.460
great if you just--
- Back in Kyova.

465
00:27:49.564 --> 00:27:52.084
it was the neighbors that didn't
talk to the other neighbors

466
00:27:52.187 --> 00:27:53.637
that you had to watch out for.

467
00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:55.743
But I'm glad you came. Willy.

468
00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:57.883
We got off on the wrong foot.

469
00:27:57.986 --> 00:27:59.401
I think we can be friends.

470
00:27:59.505 --> 00:28:01.093
Can I call you Willy?

471
00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:02.681
Yes. No. I don't--
I don't care. I just--

472
00:28:02.784 --> 00:28:04.752
It just would be great
if you just kept it down.

473
00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:06.615
- Kept what down?
- The music.

474
00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:07.720
It's just the noise--

475
00:28:07.824 --> 00:28:09.308
You know.
the walls are super-thin.

476
00:28:09.411 --> 00:28:11.310
and I'm-- I'm trying super hard
to get something done.

477
00:28:11.413 --> 00:28:13.036
What?! Wait.

478
00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:14.037
You mean...

479
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.418
- Yeah. Yes.
- That-- you?

480
00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:18.489
No. It's just
I'm trying to finish my album.

481
00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:20.560
Whoa! Wait. wait. wait.

482
00:28:20.664 --> 00:28:21.838
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait!

483
00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:22.873
Wait. Are you talking about--
- Yes.

484
00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:28.914
Please. Vlad.

485
00:28:29.017 --> 00:28:31.571
Oh!

486
00:28:31.675 --> 00:28:32.814
Turn it down. please. Vlad.

487
00:28:32.918 --> 00:28:34.920
I can't hear you!

488
00:28:35.023 --> 00:28:36.956
What did you want me to do?!

489
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.613
I want you to turn it down!

490
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.443
But the music is so good!

491
00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:45.309
You know that kind of music!

492
00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:49.520
I got that fuck-all-night music!

493
00:28:49.624 --> 00:28:51.108
- Turn it down!

494
00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:52.661
Ah! Willy!

495
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:56.631
- I'm sorry.
- The big man finally arrives.

496
00:28:56.735 --> 00:29:00.462
here to tell me to my face
to turn it down.

497
00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:02.464
- I-I'm sorry.
- You want to come at me. bro?

498
00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:05.260
- I don't want to.

499
00:29:05.364 --> 00:29:07.780
My baby cousin Miha
was just like you.

500
00:29:07.884 --> 00:29:09.230
Never fought back.

501
00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:11.646
Always asked me
to fight for him.

502
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.372
I said. "Miha. I teach you."

503
00:29:13.475 --> 00:29:16.030
But no. He refused.

504
00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:20.689
Now the little fucker is dead.

505
00:29:20.793 --> 00:29:26.281
Everybody in my home country
is dead.

506
00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:28.836
So much debt.

507
00:29:28.939 --> 00:29:33.599
So much blood.

508
00:29:33.702 --> 00:29:36.153
But now I teach you. eh?

509
00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:38.777
Come on. come on! Come at me.
- No.

510
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.088
- Take a shot.
- No. no. no.

511
00:29:40.192 --> 00:29:42.953
Vlad.
I don't want a confrontation.

512
00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:46.163
Life <i>is</i> confrontation. Willy.

513
00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:48.787
Oh. you're so strong.

514
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.685
Now my turn.

515
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.653
- Oh!
- Yeah. Way to take it. bro.

516
00:29:53.757 --> 00:29:54.896
Please stop.

517
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.588
Now. use your big-man.
brute strength

518
00:29:57.692 --> 00:29:59.556
and slam me against the wall.

519
00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:00.591
What?

520
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.181
Harder!

521
00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:06.321
Oh!

522
00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:07.426
No. Willy. Like this.

523
00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:09.531
No. no.

524
00:30:12.569 --> 00:30:14.813
Oh! My family. man?

525
00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:16.884
That takes some balls. man.

526
00:30:16.987 --> 00:30:18.299
No. That was--

527
00:30:20.301 --> 00:30:21.440
Harder. Willy!

528
00:30:21.543 --> 00:30:22.786
Oh!

529
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.167
Harder!

530
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.237
No!

531
00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.170
Hard!

532
00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:35.350
You made my... come back.

533
00:30:35.454 --> 00:30:37.352
God. I missed this shit!

534
00:30:37.456 --> 00:30:39.078
Oh!

535
00:30:39.182 --> 00:30:41.046
Oh. we should have done this
the first time!

536
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:43.013
We're could have been friends!
Oh!

537
00:30:43.117 --> 00:30:46.258
We're not gonna be friends.
you fucking...

538
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:49.882
Oh. look at that!

539
00:30:49.986 --> 00:30:51.642
What are you getting--
a frying pan?

540
00:30:53.196 --> 00:30:54.507
What are you gonna do? Oh!

541
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:57.372
- Stay back. Stay-- Stay back.
- Hell yeah!

542
00:30:57.476 --> 00:30:58.857
- Oh!
- Fuck.

543
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.997
Let me show you
how that's done. Willy.

544
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.067
Stop! No. no.

545
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.137
No. no. no. no. no. no!

546
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.346
Stop. stop!
- Calm down!

547
00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:08.487
Let me show you how you break
a bottle on a man's head.

548
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.729
You go like this--

549
00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:11.490
Oh. oh!

550
00:31:12.801 --> 00:31:14.286
- What the fuck?!
- Willy. yes!

551
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:17.323
Oh. Willy! Oh. I promise
to keep the music down!

552
00:31:17.427 --> 00:31:18.842
I'm so sorry!
Please. don't hurt me!

553
00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:21.258
- Stop. stop.
- I'll turn the music down!

554
00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:24.917
Fuck! What the fuck?! Fuck!

555
00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:28.610
Oh! Sh...

556
00:31:28.714 --> 00:31:30.612
Uh...

557
00:31:34.306 --> 00:31:35.548
Oh...

558
00:31:35.652 --> 00:31:36.722
Vlad. are you okay?

559
00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.551
I'm fine.

560
00:31:39.828 --> 00:31:42.521
- No. Fuck.

561
00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:44.557
Good job. Willy.

562
00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:45.627
No. no. no. no. no. no.

563
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:47.077
You slipped. You slipped. Vlad.

564
00:31:47.181 --> 00:31:48.389
Here. Let me-- Let me help.

565
00:31:48.492 --> 00:31:50.460
Let me help you.
- Okay. Just a little blood.

566
00:31:50.563 --> 00:31:52.565
I'm gonna put it back here.
like this.

567
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:53.808
No. No. it's not going.

568
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.085
It's not going--
It's not going back!

569
00:31:55.189 --> 00:31:57.639
Oh. it will go back in.
the little--

570
00:32:01.126 --> 00:32:02.196
Let go. let go.

571
00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:05.095
Man. it's fine. man.
I'm fine.

572
00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:08.202
I'm gonna get it off of me.
I'll be fine.

573
00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:10.894
I'll just walk it off.

574
00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:13.483
Let me just...

575
00:32:13.586 --> 00:32:15.312
- Vlad. stop!

576
00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:19.730
Oh. shit.

577
00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:23.458
Fuck.

578
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.054
Damn. That is one hot lick.

579
00:32:33.158 --> 00:32:34.849
Okay.

580
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.540
So you fucked up
and killed somebody.

581
00:32:36.644 --> 00:32:38.059
- What?
- Relax.

582
00:32:38.163 --> 00:32:41.304
Your band goes on tour.
it's gonna happen.

583
00:32:41.407 --> 00:32:44.997
On the Cataclysm tour.
we killed like nine people.

584
00:32:45.101 --> 00:32:48.759
Just need to know
how to get rid of a body.

585
00:32:48.863 --> 00:32:50.658
Let's get into it.

586
00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:53.454
The first thing is you need
a place to stash the body.

587
00:32:53.557 --> 00:32:55.801
Amp cases are great.
but temporary.
- Oh. geez!

588
00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:57.216
You got yourself
a nice bathtub.

589
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.149
then. baby. you're golden.

590
00:32:59.253 --> 00:33:02.118
Guys. I've seen so many roadies
pull out their backs.

591
00:33:02.221 --> 00:33:05.190
so just remember.
lift with your knees.

592
00:33:05.293 --> 00:33:09.056
Now. the best way to dissolve
a corpse is sodium hydroxide.

593
00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:11.368
And. brother.
you're gonna need a lot of it.

594
00:33:13.681 --> 00:33:15.062
This inexpensive substance

595
00:33:15.165 --> 00:33:17.719
breaks up the remains
at the molecular level.

596
00:33:17.823 --> 00:33:18.893
leaving behind a brown sludge

597
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.413
which easily washes down
the drain.

598
00:33:21.516 --> 00:33:23.898
You're probably wondering
how long this will take.

599
00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:26.038
Unfortunately.
the answer is three weeks.

600
00:33:26.142 --> 00:33:27.936
- What?!
- So your next best option

601
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.835
is an electrical
reciprocating saw.

602
00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:33.977
- Now. I suggest purchasing
a variety pack of blades.

603
00:33:34.081 --> 00:33:35.634
I've found that wood blades

604
00:33:35.737 --> 00:33:38.740
cut through flesh. bone. and
clothing like denim just fine.

605
00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:49.958
Also.
remember to get an adapter.

606
00:33:50.062 --> 00:33:52.513
Gah! Come on!

607
00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:54.756
The weight of the situation

608
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.896
might just be dawning on you
now.

609
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.657
and your initial squirt
of adrenaline

610
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.210
is probably wearing off.

611
00:34:00.314 --> 00:34:03.420
but just put one foot after
the other and get to a store

612
00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:07.079
before the smell of rotting
flesh tips off your neighbors.

613
00:34:07.183 --> 00:34:11.739
Now you got all your stuff.
you can get to work.

614
00:34:11.842 --> 00:34:15.122
And remember. have fun.

615
00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:16.778
Okay. Huh.

616
00:34:16.882 --> 00:34:18.056
Hmm.

617
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.885
Uh...

618
00:34:19.988 --> 00:34:22.543
Uhhh...

619
00:34:22.646 --> 00:34:24.372
Okay.

620
00:34:24.476 --> 00:34:26.719
1...2...

621
00:34:26.823 --> 00:34:28.411
3!

622
00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:30.137
The fuck?

623
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.310
Oh.

624
00:34:31.414 --> 00:34:33.485
Alright.

625
00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:41.562
God! Come on!

626
00:34:44.185 --> 00:34:46.739
Shit! Gah!

627
00:34:50.398 --> 00:34:52.573
How much blood can be in a body?

628
00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:37.825
Oh!

629
00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:39.275
No. no.

630
00:35:39.378 --> 00:35:41.173
No. no. Um...

631
00:35:47.006 --> 00:35:48.422
Hey. baby. What's up?

632
00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:50.700
<i>Hey. I'm. um-- I'm back home.</i>

633
00:35:50.803 --> 00:35:52.426
<i>Did-- Did you take off?</i>

634
00:35:52.529 --> 00:35:54.393
- Yeah. no. I went on a hike.
<i>- Okay.</i>

635
00:35:54.497 --> 00:35:56.050
<i>Um. I'm going to go to Alison's</i>

636
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.500
<i>and just work on
the depositions.</i>

637
00:35:57.603 --> 00:35:59.018
Yeah. No. no. no.
That's a--

638
00:35:59.122 --> 00:36:00.468
That's a great idea.
You love Alison. That's great.

639
00:36:00.572 --> 00:36:02.021
You haven't seen in a long time.

640
00:36:02.125 --> 00:36:03.402
<i>Okay. yeah.
I just thought maybe</i>

641
00:36:03.506 --> 00:36:04.610
<i>take some time
to cool off and--</i>

642
00:36:04.714 --> 00:36:06.164
Yeah. No. no. no.
That-- Yeah.

643
00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:07.855
That makes-- Yeah.
And I'll do my thing.

644
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:09.167
You'll-- You'll do your thing.

645
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.444
Listen. listen.
I got-- I got to go.

646
00:36:10.547 --> 00:36:11.721
I got-- I got to go.
Okay. bye-bye.

647
00:36:21.765 --> 00:36:23.111
Hello. Willy.

648
00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:24.285
No! What?

649
00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:26.011
No. No. no. no. no.

650
00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:28.324
You fucked me up good. bro.

651
00:36:28.427 --> 00:36:30.602
No. You're dead. you're dead.
You're pieces in a tub.

652
00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:33.570
You can't kill me. Willy.

653
00:36:35.572 --> 00:36:39.369
I am now living in your head
rent-free.

654
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.028
Shut up. Shut up!

655
00:36:43.131 --> 00:36:44.823
- I'm alive!
- No. you're not!

656
00:36:44.926 --> 00:36:46.100
I'm alive!

657
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:48.102
Shut the fuck up.
you fucking asshole!

658
00:36:50.932 --> 00:36:52.831
Oh!

659
00:36:55.316 --> 00:36:56.800
Fuck.

660
00:36:56.904 --> 00:37:00.494
Oh. God. Oh!

661
00:37:01.253 --> 00:37:04.187
He's dead. he's dead.
he's dead. he's dead.

662
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:06.051
- Fuck. fuck!

663
00:37:06.154 --> 00:37:09.157
Fuck you! Fuck you!

664
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:16.579
Oh. William!

665
00:37:16.682 --> 00:37:19.375
Can you just do that jiggle
thing with the fuse box?

666
00:37:19.478 --> 00:37:20.928
I can't seem to get it to work.

667
00:37:24.794 --> 00:37:26.589
I'm a little busy right now.
Eleanor.

668
00:37:26.692 --> 00:37:29.247
Oh. and. also. I was going
through my storage space.

669
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.389
and I realized that I have the
perfect thing for your album.

670
00:37:33.492 --> 00:37:35.253
I don't need your help
on the album. okay?

671
00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:36.875
I don't need anybody's help!
I'm sorry. I just--

672
00:37:36.978 --> 00:37:39.257
I can't do your chores for you
all the time.

673
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.948
You're the building manager. alright?

674
00:37:41.051 --> 00:37:42.156
I just thought that you liked

675
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.538
giving me a hand
around the building.

676
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:48.611
Sorry. Eleanor. I...

677
00:37:48.714 --> 00:37:50.095
I'm all out of hands to give.

678
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.283
Damn! That is one hot lick.

679
00:38:05.386 --> 00:38:08.458
Now let's try and find
a blast furnace.

680
00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:11.806
Molten metal will incinerate
a murdered body in seconds.

681
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.222
And then. baby.
you're back on tour.

682
00:38:21.057 --> 00:38:21.989
Yes. May I help you?

683
00:38:22.092 --> 00:38:23.473
Hey. yeah. Is this the place.

684
00:38:23.577 --> 00:38:25.544
uh. where they melt down
all of the. uh-- the metal?

685
00:38:25.648 --> 00:38:27.512
Not all of the metal.
but the metal we get.

686
00:38:27.615 --> 00:38:29.168
we do melt it down. yes.

687
00:38:29.272 --> 00:38:31.895
You think I could see it?

688
00:38:31.999 --> 00:38:33.172
Do you work here?

689
00:38:33.276 --> 00:38:35.278
Uh. no. no. no.

690
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:36.521
Do you know anyone
that works here?

691
00:38:36.624 --> 00:38:37.729
I do. actually.
Yeah. I'm here to--

692
00:38:37.832 --> 00:38:39.247
uh. um.
I'm here to surprise them.

693
00:38:39.351 --> 00:38:40.835
Mm. What's their name?

694
00:38:40.939 --> 00:38:42.906
That's also-- That's also
part of the surprise. so--

695
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.460
I'm not going to ruin
the surprise for you.

696
00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:45.668
Well. I don't want to ruin it
for you.

697
00:38:45.771 --> 00:38:46.945
- What's their name?

698
00:38:47.048 --> 00:38:48.326
Is it Marty Henderson?

699
00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:49.499
Yes. yes.
It's Marty Henderson.

700
00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:50.880
Yeah. sorry. Oh--

701
00:38:50.983 --> 00:38:52.088
Nobody named Marty Henderson
works here.

702
00:38:52.191 --> 00:38:53.261
Well. then. I-I don't--

703
00:38:53.365 --> 00:38:54.642
This isn't going to work.
Willy.

704
00:38:54.746 --> 00:38:55.540
Shut up!

705
00:38:55.643 --> 00:38:56.610
You didn't hear that. did you?

706
00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:58.059
You yelling shut up at nobody?

707
00:38:58.163 --> 00:38:59.026
Yeah. I heard.
It was very loud.

708
00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:03.720
Uh. okay. listen. Um...

709
00:39:03.824 --> 00:39:05.135
Take it.

710
00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:07.655
Do you know it's a felony to
try and bribe a federal officer?

711
00:39:07.759 --> 00:39:09.485
You're not. You're--
You're private security.

712
00:39:09.588 --> 00:39:11.003
- What if I was? Mm-hmm.
- But you're not.

713
00:39:11.107 --> 00:39:12.453
So it doesn't matter.
It's a moot point.

714
00:39:12.557 --> 00:39:14.835
Take it. Let me in.

715
00:39:14.938 --> 00:39:16.043
How much is that?

716
00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:17.803
It's-- I don't know.
It's like 14 bucks.

717
00:39:17.907 --> 00:39:20.841
14 bucks?

718
00:39:20.944 --> 00:39:23.499
This is the original demo
of the original lineup

719
00:39:23.602 --> 00:39:25.052
of "The Last Gasp
of the Lonely Whaler."

720
00:39:25.155 --> 00:39:27.572
- Oh!
- It is-- This is worth
like 400 bucks.

721
00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:29.781
400 bucks?
Yeah. Come on.

722
00:39:31.092 --> 00:39:32.404
Hmm.

723
00:39:32.508 --> 00:39:33.888
Who do I sell it to?

724
00:39:33.992 --> 00:39:35.027
Anyone who likes music.

725
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:36.063
How do I find those people?

726
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:37.340
Like a record store.

727
00:39:37.444 --> 00:39:38.962
I'm not just gonna go
to a record store

728
00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:40.654
and be like. "Hey. would you buy
this from me for 400 bucks?

729
00:39:40.757 --> 00:39:42.414
Some weird guy who tried
to come into my smelting plant

730
00:39:42.518 --> 00:39:43.484
gave it to me.

731
00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:44.865
Sell-- Sell it on eBay.

732
00:39:44.968 --> 00:39:46.314
I don't do eBay.
I don't know how to do eBay.

733
00:39:46.418 --> 00:39:47.833
It's super easy. Just. uh--

734
00:39:47.937 --> 00:39:49.248
You just need to make
a seller profile. and then--

735
00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:50.629
I'm not gonna make a profile.

736
00:39:50.733 --> 00:39:51.975
Are you kidding?
How about this?

737
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:54.012
Why don't you go sell this
for 400 bucks.

738
00:39:54.115 --> 00:39:55.600
come back and give me $414.

739
00:39:55.703 --> 00:39:56.808
and then I'll let you in?

740
00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:58.257
$414?
Where did the $14 come from?

741
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:00.052
The 14 singles you have.
you stripper.

742
00:40:00.156 --> 00:40:01.606
- Fuck off. dude.
- Fuck you!

743
00:40:01.709 --> 00:40:02.814
- Fuck you.

744
00:40:02.917 --> 00:40:04.505
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

745
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:06.300
Oh. hey.
Are you letting me in?

746
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.474
You think
the dueling fuck you's

747
00:40:07.577 --> 00:40:08.509
convinced me to let you in?

748
00:40:08.613 --> 00:40:09.579
No. I'm calling the police.

749
00:40:09.683 --> 00:40:10.822
9...
- No. no! No. don't!

750
00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:12.444
I'm-- I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

751
00:40:12.548 --> 00:40:13.687
- No! Don't touch the other one!

752
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.861
- 1...
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving!

753
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:19.002
Shit! Now...

754
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:22.972
Hey! What the fuck. man!

755
00:40:23.075 --> 00:40:25.008
Come back here!
No! Go. go. go! Leave!

756
00:40:25.112 --> 00:40:26.596
Go! Back. back!
- You have to take that!

757
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.943
No! It's mine!
I'm gonna sell it on eBay!

758

You know what?
Fuck it. rent-a-cop!

759
00:40:32.153 --> 00:40:33.914
Fucking van driver.

760
00:40:50.275 --> 00:40:51.483

761
00:40:51.587 --> 00:40:53.105
<i>Hey. William.</i>

762
00:40:53.209 --> 00:40:54.762
<i>Again. sorry about
the whole "firing you" thing.</i>

763
00:40:54.866 --> 00:40:56.281
<i>It wasn't my decision.
My hands were tied.</i>

764
00:40:56.384 --> 00:40:58.110

765
00:40:58.214 --> 00:40:59.802
<i>Tell him to bring

766
00:40:59.905 --> 00:41:01.424
<i>Yeah. Uh. if you could bring

767
00:41:01.528 --> 00:41:03.046

768
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.601
<i>And also to get back here
so we can fire him again.</i>

769
00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:07.085
<i>Okay. Sorry.
He's been partying all day.</i>

770

Oh! Croissant guy!

774

Who is that?

775
00:41:32.835 --> 00:41:36.424
I'm dead. This bitch killed me.

776
00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:37.736
Am I hallucinating?

777
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.911
It's nobody.

778
00:41:40.014 --> 00:41:42.500
Auggie. you're just seeing
things. alright. buddy?

779

if I was seeing things.

780

Oh. he murdered

787
00:42:03.072 --> 00:42:05.971
- He slipped. okay?
- No. I didn't slip.

788
00:42:06.075 --> 00:42:07.697
Hey. Auggie.

789
00:42:07.801 --> 00:42:09.216

853
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:06.531
Oh. no. Willy.
Don't do this.

854
00:45:06.634 --> 00:45:08.809
These are the coyotes out here.
- I know.

855
00:45:08.913 --> 00:45:10.466
- They're your new neighbors.

856
00:45:10.569 --> 00:45:11.950

...shit myself...

869
00:45:52.404 --> 00:45:53.440
Fucking...

870
00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:55.028
...demon.

871
00:46:04.658 --> 00:46:06.211
God damn it.

872
00:46:06.315 --> 00:46:07.350
Aaah!

873
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.702
So what's. like. the prognos--
What-- What ha--

874
00:46:14.806 --> 00:46:16.394
What happened?

875
00:46:16.497 --> 00:46:18.914
As far as I can figure.
this lady shoved a screwdriver

876
00:46:19.017 --> 00:46:20.329
into this jury-rigged
rat's nest.

877
00:46:20.432 --> 00:46:23.539
This was an accident
waiting to happen.

878
00:46:23.642 --> 00:46:25.334
Hey. look at that--

879
00:46:25.437 --> 00:46:27.370
she's wearing
a Dawn Dimension shirt.

880
00:46:27.474 --> 00:46:28.820
Wait. what?

881
00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:31.271
I guess the old lady
was really into prog.

882
00:46:39.279 --> 00:46:40.487
Aaa--

883
00:46:52.326 --> 00:46:54.294
Huh?

884
00:46:54.397 --> 00:46:57.021
Hey. Emily.

885
00:46:58.022 --> 00:47:00.645
Are you leaving?
- No.

886
00:47:00.748 --> 00:47:02.509
-  Thank God.
- Oh. no.

887
00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:04.407
I-I'm packing up my stuff.
and then I'm leaving.

888
00:47:04.511 --> 00:47:06.064
Wait. wait.
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

889
00:47:06.168 --> 00:47:07.894
You're just gonna leave
just because

890
00:47:07.997 --> 00:47:09.412
I've been out of it
the past couple days?

891
00:47:09.516 --> 00:47:12.691
It hasn't just been
the past couple of days. Will.

892
00:47:12.795 --> 00:47:13.934
I-I think we need a break.

893
00:47:14.038 --> 00:47:15.763
No. no. no.
we don't need a break.

894
00:47:15.867 --> 00:47:17.455
What are you talking--
I just--

895
00:47:17.558 --> 00:47:19.457
It's just the noise
from Vlad's apartment.

896
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.839
It was just fucking
driving me crazy. okay?

897
00:47:21.942 --> 00:47:24.427
- Yeah. but it's quiet now.
- Yeah.

898
00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:26.050
Yeah. no shit.

899
00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:28.086
- You'll find something else.
- What's that supposed to mean?

900
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.020
First. you had to find
the perfect speaker system.

901
00:47:31.124 --> 00:47:33.091
Then you had to buy the cords
from Japan.

902
00:47:33.195 --> 00:47:36.060
Then you were annoyed because
Alec was making too much noise

903
00:47:36.163 --> 00:47:37.716
while he was having sex.

904
00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.097
- Yeah. It's gross.
- It's the same thing.

905
00:47:39.201 --> 00:47:41.203
You're constantly
surrounded by problems.

906
00:47:41.306 --> 00:47:42.687
but the only constant is you.

907
00:47:44.447 --> 00:47:48.003
- Do you hear that?
- You're not even listening.

908
00:47:48.106 --> 00:47:49.970
No. Yeah. What?
No. Yeah. no. I am. no.

909
00:47:50.074 --> 00:47:52.973
What-- Do you--
You don't hear that?

910
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.997
- Yeah!

911
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:19.862
- You ready. dude?
- Go for it. my brother.

912
00:48:19.966 --> 00:48:21.243
- Chug!

913
00:48:21.346 --> 00:48:24.142
- Chug! Chug! Chug!
-  Chug!

914
00:48:24.246 --> 00:48:25.661
William.

915
00:48:25.764 --> 00:48:27.283
Hello. Will.

916
00:48:27.387 --> 00:48:30.010
You didn't expect me to stay
in that ravine. did you?

917
00:48:30.114 --> 00:48:33.117
I-I couldn't check my TikToks.

918
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.430
You-- You are ruining my life.

919
00:48:36.534 --> 00:48:38.501
Ruining <i>your</i> life?

920
00:48:38.605 --> 00:48:41.159
Asshole. you decapitated me.

921
00:48:41.263 --> 00:48:45.715
- He's got you there. man.
- No. no.

922
00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:47.717
You slipped. You slipped.

923
00:48:47.821 --> 00:48:49.305
You pulled the chain.

924
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:51.307
You knocked off
your own fucking head.

925
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:53.102
Oh. see. Ooh.
that's an interesting...

926
00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:55.070
- And you--

927
00:48:55.173 --> 00:48:56.623
You are the one
who got behind <i>my</i> van.

928
00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:58.211
- Oh. that was you--
- You got behind my van.

929
00:48:58.314 --> 00:49:00.799
Oh. Auggie. you. too...

930
00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:02.870
- Why is this happening to me?
- Why?

931
00:49:02.974 --> 00:49:04.665
Because fuck you-- that's why.

932
00:49:04.769 --> 00:49:07.599
I ain't about to let
death stop me from partying.

933
00:49:07.703 --> 00:49:10.257
Torso. turn this shit up.

934
00:49:13.157 --> 00:49:15.055
It's so cool.

935
00:49:15.159 --> 00:49:17.126
- Turn it down!

936
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.094
Turn it down. Vlad.
or I swear to God...

937
00:49:19.197 --> 00:49:21.786
What-- you're gonna murder me
twice. asshole?!

938
00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:24.513
- You slipped!
- Oh. no. baby.

939
00:49:24.616 --> 00:49:28.344
I did not slip.
- You fucking slipped!

940
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:32.107
Oh!

941
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.833
Aah! Stop it! Stop it!

942
00:49:34.937 --> 00:49:37.733
- Come on. stop it!
- Quit crying. pussy.

943
00:49:37.836 --> 00:49:39.528
Get up and fight me.

944
00:49:39.631 --> 00:49:42.324
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- Ohh.

945
00:49:46.328 --> 00:49:49.952
No. Here. William.
Drink this.

946
00:49:52.955 --> 00:49:54.508
- Ooh!

947
00:49:54.612 --> 00:49:56.510
Shit. man!

948
00:49:56.614 --> 00:49:58.823
I didn't know
you liked to party.

949
00:49:58.926 --> 00:50:00.790
Auggie. pour him another one.

950
00:50:00.894 --> 00:50:02.723
Yes.

951
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.003
Take it. man.

952
00:50:06.106 --> 00:50:08.833
- Oh. fuck it. man.
- Fuck it. man.

-  Yeah.

956
00:50:50.288 --> 00:50:52.980
If Ozzy Osbourne can bite
the head off of a bat.

957
00:50:53.084 --> 00:50:56.915
why can't I sling a dead possum
into my drummer's face?

958
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.404
Well. that's when
I got kicked out of the band.

959
00:51:07.098 --> 00:51:09.583
- Oh. my God.
- Oh. great...

960
00:51:09.687 --> 00:51:11.378
August Swig Anderson.

961
00:51:11.482 --> 00:51:13.311
How did
I never even notice that?

962
00:51:13.415 --> 00:51:15.727
- It's the beard.

963
00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:18.799
The beard.

964
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:23.770
You know.
your "how to rock" videos--

965
00:51:23.873 --> 00:51:26.083
I mean. I've. like.
just fashioned my entire life

966
00:51:26.186 --> 00:51:27.912

967
00:51:28.015 --> 00:51:29.362
How's that going for you?

968
00:51:29.465 --> 00:51:31.571
- Okay. okay.

969
00:51:31.674 --> 00:51:33.159
No so good. Willy!

970
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.819
Point taken. Yeah.
Yeah. actually. you know.

971
00:51:38.923 --> 00:51:43.100
Dawn Dimension's just-- just
a huge influence on my work.

972
00:51:43.203 --> 00:51:44.618
Ohh.

973
00:51:44.722 --> 00:51:48.933
The classic rock shit sucks.
Willy.

974
00:51:49.036 --> 00:51:51.073
You can't fuck all night
to that shit.

975
00:51:51.177 --> 00:51:53.903
It's not exactly classic rock. though.

976
00:51:54.007 --> 00:51:55.250
It's prog. you know?

977
00:51:55.353 --> 00:51:59.046
It's a series
of musical metamorphoses.

978
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.772
an auditory labyrinth. you know?

979
00:52:00.876 --> 00:52:02.222
Yeah. whatever.

980
00:52:02.326 --> 00:52:04.362
You can't fuck to it.

981
00:52:04.466 --> 00:52:06.261
Why do you want
to make that shit

982
00:52:06.364 --> 00:52:09.609
when you can make EDM?

983
00:52:09.712 --> 00:52:11.024
Prog is...

984
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.475
Prog is like life. man.

985
00:52:13.578 --> 00:52:15.270
It's complex.

986
00:52:15.373 --> 00:52:18.652
It's overwhelming
and confusing...

987
00:52:18.756 --> 00:52:20.102
always changing.

988
00:52:22.208 --> 00:52:24.762
Prog artists
take every idea they have

989
00:52:24.865 --> 00:52:29.974
and put it into
every single song. you know?

990
00:52:30.077 --> 00:52:31.838
You'll find one verse that has

991
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:35.255
flute. didgeridoo.
and a washboard and a synth.

992
00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.015
It's just wild.

993
00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.086
They promise
to deliver everything.

994
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:41.503
and they actually try and do it.

995
00:52:41.606 --> 00:52:45.162
There's crazy hope in that--

996
00:52:45.265 --> 00:52:47.233
to try and set out
to do the impossible

997
00:52:47.336 --> 00:52:50.097
and actually do it sometimes.

998
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.858
And not everyone will get it.

999
00:52:54.378 --> 00:52:56.069
But the right ones will.

1000
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:57.933
Oh.

1001
00:52:58.036 --> 00:53:00.625
Wow.
Where were you 30 years ago?

1002
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.526
You could have talked some sense
into Phil Collins.

1003
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.325
- Ah.
- Well. shit. man.

1004
00:53:10.428 --> 00:53:12.603
I guess I better hear

1005
00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:15.847
just fuck-free music
I died for. eh?

1006
00:53:15.951 --> 00:53:17.194
- Really?

1007
00:53:17.297 --> 00:53:18.988
Yeah. Let's hear it.
I want to hear it.

1008
00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:20.335
- Oh. wow.
- Yeah.

1009
00:53:20.438 --> 00:53:23.234
- Swig?
- Come on. Auggie.

1010
00:53:23.338 --> 00:53:25.202
Okay. Alright.
let's go to my apartment.

1011
00:53:25.305 --> 00:53:27.997
Okay.
Oh. fuck. I can't get up.

1012
00:53:28.101 --> 00:53:29.654
I got no arms.
- I got you.

1013
00:53:29.758 --> 00:53:30.724
Okay. Thank you.

1014
00:53:30.828 --> 00:53:32.070
- Okay.

1015
00:53:32.174 --> 00:53:33.520
- That's good. Willy.
- Alright.

1016
00:53:33.624 --> 00:53:34.763
Just remember. guys.
it's not mixed yet.

1017
00:53:34.866 --> 00:53:36.143
so it's not mixed.
it's not mixed.

1018
00:53:36.247 --> 00:53:37.697
Okay. so...
- Okay.

1019
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.181
- Play the music. Willy.

1020
00:53:42.011 --> 00:53:43.289
Ooh.

1021
00:53:43.392 --> 00:53:44.842
Okay. here--
Okay. here it comes.

1022
00:53:44.945 --> 00:53:46.257
Like that.

1023
00:53:49.156 --> 00:53:51.089
- Pow!
- Whoa!

1024
00:53:51.193 --> 00:53:52.470
Oh. this is good!

1025
00:53:52.574 --> 00:53:55.197
- You like it?
- Turn it up. Willy.

1026
00:53:55.301 --> 00:53:58.304
I might be able
to fuck to this after all.

1027
00:53:59.926 --> 00:54:03.378
Alright. You like this?
I can't believe you like it.

1028
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:06.933
- Make it stop!
- Oh. hey. guys. pig guy's here.

1029
00:54:07.036 --> 00:54:08.797
Pig guy.
oh. you brought the pig!

1030
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.178
- Bring the piggy into party.

1031
00:54:11.282 --> 00:54:12.973
- You make it stop!
- What?

1032
00:54:13.077 --> 00:54:14.596
All day and night

1033
00:54:14.699 --> 00:54:16.529
- Oh. fuck you.

1034
00:54:16.632 --> 00:54:19.394
- Chill out. man.

1035
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:22.466
-"Pig guy"? You call me pig guy?
- Yeah.

1036
00:54:22.569 --> 00:54:26.815
My name is Phillip!

1037
00:54:26.918 --> 00:54:30.232
My emotional support pigs
don't define me!

1038
00:54:30.336 --> 00:54:32.130
- Ooh.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.552
Hey. if it's too loud. just get
some earplugs or something.

1043
00:54:39.655 --> 00:54:42.796
I can't.
I have tiny ear canals!

1044
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:43.901
Fuck.

1045
00:54:45.212 --> 00:54:46.628

1046
00:54:46.731 --> 00:54:48.664
No.
Hey. come on. man!

00:54:48.768 --> 00:54:50.114
Oh. let's see

00:54:51.667 --> 00:54:52.944
Pure shit.

You cock!

00:54:57.915 --> 00:55:00.469

00:55:00.573 --> 00:55:04.024

00:55:04.128 --> 00:55:05.957
- Pure shit!
- Hey! Come on. man!

1056
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:07.304
My father gave me this record!

1057
00:55:07.407 --> 00:55:08.615
I don't give a shit
about your father.

1058
00:55:08.719 --> 00:55:09.996
Give me this.

00:55:21.835 --> 00:55:23.320
Take it-- I can take it out.
I'll take it out.

1066
00:55:23.423 --> 00:55:25.080
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

1067
00:55:25.183 --> 00:55:26.840
Oh. shit!

00:55:26.944 --> 00:55:28.428
Ohh. that's gotta hurt.

00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:35.124

Okay. okay. okay.

Oh. fuck. Oh. fuck.

00:55:45.169 --> 00:55:46.998
Oh. shit.

1076
00:55:47.102 --> 00:55:48.379
Fucking...

1077
00:55:48.483 --> 00:55:51.831
- I'm gonna feed you to my pig!

1078
00:55:51.934 --> 00:55:54.074
Don't--
Don't make me use my...

00:55:56.076 --> 00:55:57.423

Gonna take more

1081
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:04.050
- Aaah!

00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:06.949

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:14.163
Ohh. that hurts!

1085
00:56:16.373 --> 00:56:18.961
Get off me!

1086
00:56:21.067 --> 00:56:22.137
Ohh.

1087
00:56:25.002 --> 00:56:26.141
Come on. dude.

1088
00:56:26.244 --> 00:56:28.281
Put him out of his misery.
Willy.

1089
00:56:30.248 --> 00:56:33.217
Ah. yes. Yes!

1090
00:56:34.529 --> 00:56:35.944
I'm so sorry.

1091
00:56:36.047 --> 00:56:38.395
I-- Phillip. I'm so sorry.

1092
00:56:39.706 --> 00:56:42.088
Will. what is the--

1093
00:56:43.641 --> 00:56:45.781
- Emily.
- What the fuck?

1094
00:56:45.885 --> 00:56:47.369
I thought-- I thought
you were staying at Alison's.

1095
00:56:47.473 --> 00:56:49.820
I forgot the printer paper.

1096
00:56:51.477 --> 00:56:54.238
Did you... kill Phillip?

1097
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:55.895
God. You know his name.

1098
00:56:55.998 --> 00:56:57.241
Awk-waaard.

1099
00:56:57.344 --> 00:56:59.001
- Shut up!
- Oh.

1100
00:56:59.105 --> 00:57:00.934
Here's-- Here's the thing.
Emily. It was an accident.

1101
00:57:01.038 --> 00:57:02.798
- You murdered him by accident?
- Yeah!

1102
00:57:02.902 --> 00:57:04.213
They were all by accident.

1103
00:57:04.317 --> 00:57:05.698
- No. no. no. no. no. no.
- Oh. my God!

1104
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.665
Emily!
Please wait. I can explain.

1105
00:57:07.769 --> 00:57:09.253
Wait? W-W-What is there
to explain. Will?

1106
00:57:09.356 --> 00:57:10.565
You-- You--
You killed someone.

1107
00:57:10.668 --> 00:57:11.669
and now
you're going to kill me. too?

1108
00:57:11.773 --> 00:57:13.844
No. no! It's just that...

1109
00:57:13.947 --> 00:57:15.432
You're not gonna call the cops.
are you?

1110
00:57:15.535 --> 00:57:16.502
I'm probably gonna go
to the cops. yeah.

1111
00:57:16.605 --> 00:57:17.813
- No. no. no.
- Yeah.

1112
00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:19.159
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1113
00:57:19.263 --> 00:57:20.540
See?

1114
00:57:20.644 --> 00:57:22.128
That's not gonna work for me.
- Okay. okay.

1115
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:23.854
Maybe this is the part
where you just tell you

1116
00:57:23.957 --> 00:57:25.580
that this isn't who you are
and you're not like this.

1117
00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:27.305
- I'm not! I'm not like this.
- Okay.

1118
00:57:27.409 --> 00:57:28.617
A-A-And please don't hurt me.

1119
00:57:28.721 --> 00:57:30.412
I would never hurt you!

1120
00:57:30.516 --> 00:57:32.172
Oh!

1121
00:57:43.805 --> 00:57:45.254
Aaaa--

1122
00:57:50.397 --> 00:57:53.884
- Hey. It's that guy.
- That was easy.

1123
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:10.901
Vlad.

1124
00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:14.836
Auggie?

1125
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.670
If you guys are still around...

1126
00:58:21.774 --> 00:58:24.880
go get the keys
from the guard and let me out.

1127
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:29.575
Mm.

1128
00:58:29.678 --> 00:58:31.784
Everything's--

1129
00:58:31.887 --> 00:58:33.855
Okay. so. Vlad.
get the keys from the guard.

1130
00:58:33.958 --> 00:58:37.375
Auggie. you go and. uh. make--
uh. create a diversion.

1131
00:58:37.479 --> 00:58:39.274
And then. pig guy-- fuck!--
Phil--

1132
00:58:39.377 --> 00:58:40.827
you disable
the security cameras.

1133
00:58:40.931 --> 00:58:42.208
So. Vlad. you get the keys.

1134
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:45.004
Auggie. you-- you--
you create a diversion...

1135
00:58:45.107 --> 00:58:46.592
Pig guy-- fuck!-- Phillip--
Get the keys.

1136
00:58:46.695 --> 00:58:48.386
Auggie. you-- you--
you create a diversion...

1137
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.181
Okay. okay. okay.
And then-- And then--

1138
00:58:50.285 --> 00:58:51.182
And-- And-- And. uh...

1139
00:58:51.286 --> 00:58:52.736
Okay.
Uh...

1140
00:58:52.839 --> 00:58:55.014
That sounds--
That's a good plan.

1141
00:58:55.117 --> 00:58:56.463
That's a good plan.

1142
00:58:56.567 --> 00:58:57.672
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

1143
00:58:59.605 --> 00:59:01.503
And the final line was--
and he goes.

1144
00:59:01.607 --> 00:59:04.368
"I'll show you
my phaser blaster." right?

1145
00:59:04.471 --> 00:59:06.266
Works every... time.

1146
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:07.923
Alec?

1147
00:59:08.027 --> 00:59:10.685
William?
You dog!

1148
00:59:10.788 --> 00:59:12.514
This is my friend.
- Ah.

1149
00:59:12.618 --> 00:59:15.172
Oopsies.

1150
00:59:15.275 --> 00:59:17.070
Ohh.

1151
00:59:17.174 --> 00:59:19.659
What are you doing here?
Does this have anything to do

1152
00:59:19.763 --> 00:59:22.628
with the disappearances
at the apartment?

1153
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:25.078
- Whaaaat?
- Oh. no. I just--

1154
00:59:25.182 --> 00:59:26.908
- Really?
- No. I didn't...

1155
00:59:27.011 --> 00:59:28.461
No.

1156
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:32.085
No. I got drunk at a party
and punched a guy in the face.

1157
00:59:32.189 --> 00:59:35.882
Yeah. he's posting on Twitter.
saying I stole his movie idea.

1158
00:59:35.986 --> 00:59:37.539
Did you?

1159
00:59:37.643 --> 00:59:39.679
- Yeah. Kind of.
- Mm.

1160
00:59:39.783 --> 00:59:44.132
- It's a bit of an issue.
- Mm. That sucks.

1161
00:59:44.235 --> 00:59:46.928
Really assuming things
were on the up and up for you.

1162
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:49.655
They were.

1163
00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:52.140
They were.

1164
00:59:53.244 --> 00:59:58.146
But wherever I go.
I'm. uh. still me. you know?

1165
00:59:58.249 --> 00:59:59.906
Yeah.

1166
01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:03.323
Well. I'm not gonna let
that guy get in my way.

1167
01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:06.085
- Mm.
- Know what I mean?

1168
01:00:06.188 --> 01:00:07.673
How's Emily. by the way?

1169
01:00:07.776 --> 01:00:10.434
She's okay.
I think we broke up.

1170
01:00:10.537 --> 01:00:12.401
- Really?
- Yeah.

1171
01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:16.095
- Ohh. I'm sorry.
- Yeah. thanks.

1172
01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:17.993
Weird if you gave me
her number?

1173
01:00:18.097 --> 01:00:19.581
Yes. absolutely.

1174
01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:22.860
William Brown.
your lawyer's here.

1175
01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:31.420
Mnh-mnh.

1176
01:00:31.524 --> 01:00:33.353
Man. is there a way we can
just skip all this shit

1177
01:00:33.457 --> 01:00:35.597
and get straight to the fucking
lethal injection or whatever--

1178
01:00:35.701 --> 01:00:38.013
Stop!
Just be cool. okay?

1179
01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:40.153
- Alright.
- Okay. I know it's a hassle.

1180
01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:41.914
but we got to go through
all this due process crap. okay?

1181
01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:43.363
Okay.

1182
01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:51.648
Ah. here we are.

1183
01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.481
William Brown.

1184
01:01:01.519 --> 01:01:02.693
Yes!

1185
01:01:02.797 --> 01:01:04.833
You're getting out. my friend.

1186
01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:06.973
- Wait. No.

1187
01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:08.975
Wait. What?
- Police didn't find a body.

1188
01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:11.426
That doesn't--
That doesn't make sense.

1189
01:01:11.529 --> 01:01:15.292
Two cops conducted a thorough
search of the entire building.

1190
01:01:15.395 --> 01:01:18.398
and they searched your apartment
top to bottom.

1191
01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:21.712
There was no conclusive evidence
of foul play of any kind.

1192
01:01:21.816 --> 01:01:24.957
They just found a torn shirt.
pile of knives.

1193
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.545
a bunch of worthless
broken records.

1194
01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:31.135
and some animal droppings.

1195
01:01:31.239 --> 01:01:32.723
Blah. blah. blah.

1196
01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:35.243
And it looks like someone
named Emily.

1197
01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:37.659
That's. uh. my girlfriend--
ex-girlfriend or--

1198
01:01:37.763 --> 01:01:39.316
or something-- I'm not sure.
- Yeah?

1199
01:01:39.419 --> 01:01:41.490
Well. she says she found a body
in your apartment.

1200
01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:43.044
The police didn't find one.

1201
01:01:43.147 --> 01:01:44.631
didn't find a single
drop of blood. so she lied.

1202
01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.944
No. she didn't lie.
She was th--

1203
01:01:47.048 --> 01:01:48.843
She was there 'cause she's a--

1204
01:01:48.946 --> 01:01:50.637
She-- She can't get in trouble.
She's a good person.

1205
01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:53.226
She doe-- Like. listen. I'm the
one who is a manslaughter.

1206
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.883
I'm the--
- Shh!

1207
01:01:55.919 --> 01:01:57.058
Emily's going to be fine. okay?

1208
01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.853
It's just a domestic
disturbance.

1209
01:01:58.956 --> 01:02:00.130
- Okay.
- William. I think we need

1210
01:02:00.233 --> 01:02:02.235
to take the win here.

1211
01:02:02.339 --> 01:02:05.480
It's gonna really help me
out at home with the old lady.

1212
01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.447
She hates that
I never win stuff.

1213
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.381
Okay?
- Okay.

1214
01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:13.212
Just be cool
and don't murder anyone else.

1215
01:02:13.315 --> 01:02:14.661
- I didn't.
- Okay?

1216
01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:15.835
Okay.

1217
01:02:15.939 --> 01:02:19.494
- Deal?
- Deal. Okay.

1218
01:02:19.597 --> 01:02:21.185
Oh. there was
one other thing--

1219
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:23.567
the cops said they want you to
officially identify the body

1220
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.017
of some woman
down at the morgue.

1221
01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.812
They think you might know her. okay?

1222
01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:28.399
- Yeah.
- Done.

1223
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.444
Yeah. that's-- that's her.

1224
01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:41.102
Uh.
can I have a minute with her?

1225
01:02:46.659 --> 01:02:48.557
Eleanor...

1226
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:52.527
Oh. William!

1227
01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:56.842
Eleanor.
Eleanor. I'm so sorry.

1228
01:02:56.945 --> 01:03:00.638
Oh. stop it. boy.
What are you sorry for?

1229
01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:03.124
- For killing you.
- I-- You didn't kill me.

1230
01:03:03.227 --> 01:03:06.403
I electrocuted myself.
- No. no. no. No. no. no. no.

1231
01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:09.199
You-- You asked me to help.
and I didn't help. And then...

1232
01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:12.823
'Cause I was
too focused on my own shit.

1233
01:03:12.927 --> 01:03:15.930
Oh. I'm the one who tried
to be an electrician.

1234
01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:19.174
I should have taken your advice
and hired one.

1235
01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:21.659
But I didn't want to listen.

1236
01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:24.559
Blaming anyone else
is a waste of time.

1237
01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:26.009
Yeah. I guess so.

1238
01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:30.185
Nothing happens for a reason.
Life is chaos.

1239
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:34.051
Things just happen.
and we give them reason.

1240
01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:39.160
Nobody has as much time
as they think. you know. okay?

1241
01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:41.196
Now that I've absolved you.

1242
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.647
isn't there something
you want to do

1243
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.443
with the time you have left?

1244
01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:48.169
I want to finish my album.

1245
01:03:48.272 --> 01:03:50.240
You mean the album
I was trying to help you with.

1246
01:03:50.343 --> 01:03:52.069
your little shit?

1247
01:03:52.173 --> 01:03:55.279
Go do that.
Finish the album.

1248
01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:57.350
I don't know
if I can finish anything.

1249
01:03:57.454 --> 01:04:00.112
and it makes me hate myself.
and I'm so scared

1250
01:04:00.215 --> 01:04:01.838
if it's not going to be perfect.
no one will get it.

1251
01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:03.115
and my father was fucking right.

1252
01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:05.462
William. use your demons.

1253
01:04:05.565 --> 01:04:07.498
Don't let them use <i>you.</i>

1254
01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:10.156
Accept their help. William.

1255
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.918
Yeah. No. I get it.
I get it. I get all that.

1256
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:14.540
But it's just-- it's just--
yeah. and I think--

1257
01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:17.198
I think I need a couple
of mental health days.

1258
01:04:18.268 --> 01:04:19.856
Damn it! There's no time.

1259
01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.719
Do you think they're never
going to figure out

1260
01:04:21.823 --> 01:04:23.273
about the other people
you've killed?

1261
01:04:23.376 --> 01:04:25.033
They were accidents.
I didn't kill anybody.

1262
01:04:25.137 --> 01:04:28.243
Oh! Okay. I see I'm going
to have to help you.

1263
01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:30.245
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1264
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:33.248
<i>Welcome to part five
of my ongoing video series.</i>

1265
01:04:33.352 --> 01:04:34.801
<i>Rockin' in the Fifth Dimension.</i>

1266
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.390
<i>Listen. what you wear</i>

1267
01:04:37.494 --> 01:04:39.220
<i>is just as important
as your playing.</i>

1268
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:41.015
<i>Let's start with the scarf--</i>

1269
01:04:41.118 --> 01:04:42.809
<i>the scarf's
the most important part</i>

1270
01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.121
<i>of a bass player's wardrobe</i>

1271
01:04:44.225 --> 01:04:45.985
<i>'cause it's
close to your heart.</i>

1272
01:04:46.089 --> 01:04:48.125
<i>And that's where
the beat is. baby.</i>

1273
01:04:52.164 --> 01:04:56.202
William. I've got something
for you in the basement.

1274
01:04:56.306 --> 01:04:57.548
Okay.

1275
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.620
Holy shit.

1276
01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:04.486
Eleanor. you've had this stuff
in here the whole time?

1277
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:08.905
- I kept trying to tell you.
- I know. Thanks.

1278
01:05:09.008 --> 01:05:10.423
Anytime.

1279
01:05:10.527 --> 01:05:12.563
Hold on.
Do you know what this is?

1280
01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:16.636
This is a 1978 Mobius Megatar.

1281
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.364
It's the same one
Swig Anderson played on the...

1282
01:05:20.468 --> 01:05:22.539
- Mythology of Madness Tour.
- Mythology of Madness Tour.

1283
01:05:22.642 --> 01:05:23.989
motherfucker!
- Yeah!

1284
01:05:24.092 --> 01:05:25.611
- Oh. you guys!

1285
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:27.095
- Yeah. baby!
- You came back!

1286
01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:30.650
Never gonna leave you. bro.
Never.

1287
01:05:30.754 --> 01:05:35.172
Eleanor... I like what
you've done with your hair.

1288
01:05:35.276 --> 01:05:37.899
It's been a while.
Mr. Magic Fingers.

1289
01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:40.626
- Ugh.
- Still good for one hot lick?

1290
01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.145
- Mnh.

1291
01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:43.767
- What the fuck?
- Ahh.

1292
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.182
Okay. okay. okay. hey. hey.
listen. we got work to do.

1293
01:05:45.286 --> 01:05:46.770
- Yeah.
- Alright. well.

1294
01:05:46.873 --> 01:05:48.392
what instruments
does everybody play?

1295
01:05:48.496 --> 01:05:50.912
Oh. I could lay down
some sick beats for you. bro.

1296
01:05:51.016 --> 01:05:51.948
Awesome.

1297
01:05:52.051 --> 01:05:53.190
- Bass.
- Right.

1298
01:05:53.294 --> 01:05:54.951
- And I'll run the board.
- Okay.

1299
01:05:55.054 --> 01:05:56.538
Uh. Phillip. what do you play?

1300
01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:59.093
Well. my preferred instrument
is the bassoon.

1301
01:05:59.196 --> 01:06:00.784
Ah. Okay. whatever.
We'll figure it out later.

1302
01:06:00.887 --> 01:06:02.130
I think you got
all the stuff you need

1303
01:06:02.234 --> 01:06:03.338
to make your album.

1304
01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.237
I've always had the stuff.

1305
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.998
What I needed was the help.

1306
01:06:08.102 --> 01:06:10.207
You guys want to make this
record with me or what?

1307
01:06:10.311 --> 01:06:11.829
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

1308
01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:15.764
A little help?

1309
01:06:15.868 --> 01:06:17.628
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1310
01:06:17.732 --> 01:06:19.768
Let's get out of this shithole.

1311
01:06:19.872 --> 01:06:21.978
- Fuck. yeah. Willy!
- Yeah!

1312
01:06:37.303 --> 01:06:38.891
See if I can find
the light switch.

1313
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.204
- Don't bother. Found it for you.

1314
01:06:41.307 --> 01:06:43.344
- Fuck!
- William.

1315
01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:46.450
Breaking and entering is not
what rock and roll is all about.

1316
01:06:46.554 --> 01:06:48.245
Yeah. it's a good thing
we were just finishing up

1317
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:50.109
our epic all-night jam sesh.
or we might have missed you.

1318
01:06:50.213 --> 01:06:51.455
Why are you in your underwear?

1319
01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:53.216
Wanted to record
some tracks naked.

1320
01:06:53.319 --> 01:06:54.769
Yeah. we were in the zone.
It was part of our process.

1321
01:06:54.872 --> 01:06:57.392
- Right. part of the process.
- What are you doing here?

1322
01:06:57.496 --> 01:07:00.050
- I'm here to finish my album.

1323
01:07:00.154 --> 01:07:01.810
- Yeah. Fuck that.
- Shit!

1324
01:07:01.914 --> 01:07:04.503
Caleb. no!
What are you doing?!

1325
01:07:04.606 --> 01:07:06.091
It's Caleb Bang Jansen!

1326
01:07:06.194 --> 01:07:07.678
You got to say the whole name.
Say it again!

1327
01:07:07.782 --> 01:07:09.887
Caleb Bang Jansen.
what are you doing?!

1328
01:07:09.991 --> 01:07:11.406
Put me in the game. Willy.

1329
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.409
Word on the street--
this dork is a mass murderer.

1330
01:07:14.513 --> 01:07:15.790
I'm saving us.

1331
01:07:15.893 --> 01:07:17.826
That's where you're wrong.
Caleb Bang Jansen.

1332
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.966
I'm not a mass murderer.

1333
01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.796
I'm a mass manslaughter.

1334
01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:32.324
Help!

1335
01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:35.706
Shit! Shit!

1336
01:07:40.194 --> 01:07:41.781
Ah. ah. ah.

1337
01:07:41.885 --> 01:07:42.989
Try me.

1338
01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:45.095
- Nice cock.

1339
01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:46.648
Let's rock!

1340
01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.549
Ohh!

1341
01:07:50.652 --> 01:07:51.584
Aah!

1342
01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:57.556
Ohh!

1343
01:07:59.351 --> 01:08:01.077
No. no. no. no!

1344
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.148
No!
Just fucking kill me!

1345
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:05.253
I fucking hate prog!

1346
01:08:05.357 --> 01:08:08.291
Hey. Scott. here's those cords
you wanted back. alright?

1347
01:08:08.394 --> 01:08:13.537
Alright. boys. it's time
to make a hit record.

1348
01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:20.613
Okay.

1349
01:08:20.717 --> 01:08:23.927
Let's finally finish it.

1350
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.618
One. two. three. fou-- ohh!

1351
01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.451
Ow. Eleanor. what's up
with the feedback?

1352
01:08:30.554 --> 01:08:31.866
It's not us.

1353
01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:34.869
William Brown!

1354
01:08:34.972 --> 01:08:37.216
Release the hostages.
Come out with your hands up!

1355
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.633
- Oh. no! Five-O.
- Who called the cops?

1356
01:08:40.737 --> 01:08:43.153
Ooh. It's a
good question. Willy.

1357
01:08:43.257 --> 01:08:45.431
Your only warning!

1358
01:08:46.605 --> 01:08:49.228
We still need more time
to finish the album.

1359
01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.161
We got to convince them
that I'm dangerous.

1360
01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:52.611
What are you talking about.
Billy?

1361
01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:54.026
You are dangerous.

1362
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.615
- Vlad. that's a great idea.
- What idea?

1363
01:08:56.718 --> 01:08:57.823
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1364
01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:08.696
Captain. it looks like
he's giving us a message.

1365
01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:26.265
"I just need a couple hours
to finish recording

1366
01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:28.543
and mixing the last track
on my album.

1367
01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:31.684
It's prog. so the post process
can be fairly involved.

1368
01:09:31.788 --> 01:09:33.548
Do not attempt to enter
the building

1369
01:09:33.652 --> 01:09:35.688
or I will harm the hostages.

1370
01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:38.519
If you don't believe me.
see attached."

1371
01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:41.694
Man. I was hoping to get through
the rest of the week

1372
01:09:41.798 --> 01:09:44.456
without seeing
another one of these.

1373
01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:46.147
Sorry about the hand. Vlad.

1374
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.977
Is okay. It's the other
hand I use for noodling.

1375
01:09:49.081 --> 01:09:50.220
- Gross.

1376
01:09:50.324 --> 01:09:52.188
Hey. William.
we have someone here

1377
01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:54.086
we thought
you might want to talk to.

1378
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.197
Excuse me.
I don't--

1379
01:10:03.302 --> 01:10:04.752
Hey. Will.

1380
01:10:04.855 --> 01:10:06.547
Shit.

1381
01:10:22.839 --> 01:10:25.186
Hey!
Just want to let you know.

1382
01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:28.154
you come any closer.
I'm gonna shoot you.

1383
01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:31.192
With a gun.
- ♪ G-u-u-un

1384
01:10:31.296 --> 01:10:33.090
Emily. what are you doing here?

1385
01:10:33.194 --> 01:10:37.819
Um. they made me come negotiate
to release the hostages.

1386
01:10:37.923 --> 01:10:39.580
Scott and Caleb.

1387
01:10:39.683 --> 01:10:43.100
I didn't really want to. but
they kind of said that I had to.

1388
01:10:43.204 --> 01:10:46.034
Is this. um. supposed to
convince me to come out or...?

1389
01:10:46.138 --> 01:10:47.588
Hey. tell you what.
Alan Parsons.

1390
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:49.175
You know what?
Just listen to

1391
01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:51.730
what she has to say and turn
those effects down. please.

1392
01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:53.973
Sorry! Sorry.
It was for a bridge.

1393
01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:55.251
Sorry. It's just--

1394
01:10:55.354 --> 01:10:56.666
I'm just--
We're working really hard

1395
01:10:56.769 --> 01:10:58.599
on trying to finish the album
is all. you know?

1396
01:10:58.702 --> 01:11:00.325
I don't think being rude
is gonna help. sir.

1397
01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:03.224
I. um-- Well. they want me
to tell you that--

1398
01:11:03.328 --> 01:11:05.882
that I love you.
and I forgive you.

1399
01:11:05.985 --> 01:11:09.334
and that if you can
just release the hostages.

1400
01:11:09.437 --> 01:11:10.852
then everything will be okay.

1401
01:11:10.956 --> 01:11:14.304
and you can come out
of all of this safely

1402
01:11:14.408 --> 01:11:18.377
and live happily ever after
or whatever.

1403
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:19.896
But what do you want to say?

1404
01:11:19.999 --> 01:11:21.967
What do I want to say?

1405
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:25.073
That I'm mad at you.
- Just stick to the script.

1406
01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:28.318
Give me this.
I'm just--

1407
01:11:28.422 --> 01:11:31.252
I'm so mad at you.

1408
01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:33.219
I mean. I knew
that you had problems.

1409
01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:35.014
I do. too. but I just...

1410
01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:37.845
I thought we were gonna help
each other through them. but...

1411
01:11:37.948 --> 01:11:40.296
But you just never were able
to get over them.

1412
01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:41.642
It was like
you didn't even want to.

1413
01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:43.402
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1414
01:11:43.506 --> 01:11:44.852
I just-- I was just doing
that thing

1415
01:11:44.955 --> 01:11:47.303
where I just-- I let everybody
get in my way.

1416
01:11:47.406 --> 01:11:48.925
or I was convinced they were.
you know?

1417
01:11:49.028 --> 01:11:53.792
And just. like. I would
blame you or work or just...

1418
01:11:53.895 --> 01:11:57.036
I really thought it was
the shithole apartment.

1419
01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.107
And. um...

1420
01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:01.972
I guess. you know. it turns out
I'm the shithole apartment.

1421
01:12:02.076 --> 01:12:05.562
Yes. you were
the shithole apartment. Will.

1422
01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:09.394
I put you through so much.
and I'm so sorry for all this.

1423
01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:11.603
Was just so close...

1424
01:12:11.706 --> 01:12:13.087
I was so close
to finishing the album.

1425
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:15.917
Almost done for real.
And I just-- I don't want

1426
01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:18.679
all of this to be for nothing.
You know?

1427
01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:20.508
You're really close to being
<i>done</i> done?

1428
01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:21.820
Like. <i>done</i> done.
like. almost for real this time.

1429
01:12:21.923 --> 01:12:23.235
We're almost done.
It's just like.

1430
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.650
fuck. it's so close!

1431
01:12:24.754 --> 01:12:28.723
Maybe I could remind you
how good it used to be.

1432
01:12:28.827 --> 01:12:30.518
you know. before.
and-- and then that'll

1433
01:12:30.622 --> 01:12:31.795
help you to surrender?

1434
01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:34.591
Emily.
I know how good it used to be.

1435
01:12:34.695 --> 01:12:36.144
No. no. Will!
Listen to me.

1436
01:12:36.248 --> 01:12:40.770
Remember when we bought time
at that cabin in Big Bear?

1437
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:45.568
That's a great idea.
You know. if I-- if I heard

1438
01:12:45.671 --> 01:12:49.779
that story. the Big Bear story.
the whole thing.

1439
01:12:49.882 --> 01:12:53.921
I declare that I would
release the hostages.

1440
01:12:54.024 --> 01:12:55.854
Okay. Um. do you remember
that we wanted

1441
01:12:55.957 --> 01:12:58.753
to just get away for a weekend
because we were just

1442
01:12:58.857 --> 01:13:00.962
sick of town?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. I remember.

1443
01:13:01.066 --> 01:13:03.724
And so we loaded up
all of our stuff...

1444
01:13:03.827 --> 01:13:06.002
Okay. Depending on
how Emily tells the story.

1445
01:13:06.105 --> 01:13:08.867
we have 25 to 38 minutes
to finish this record.

1446
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:10.765
Oh. God.
Is it the Big Bear story?

1447
01:13:10.869 --> 01:13:11.904
Yeah.

1448
01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:14.148
I'm Caleb Bang Jansen!

1449
01:13:24.469 --> 01:13:28.334
In the beginning.
there was rock.

1450
01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:32.166
And that rock progressed.

1451
01:13:32.269 --> 01:13:33.961
But it went into hiding.

1452
01:13:35.963 --> 01:13:38.034
...fills the car
with board games.

1453
01:13:38.137 --> 01:13:41.071
and I was like. "Why are you
bringing board games?"

1454
01:13:41.175 --> 01:13:42.452
And you're like. "Whatever..."

1455
01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:45.800
Now it
is finally ready to return.

1456
01:13:45.904 --> 01:13:51.357
I present to you
"Epitaph for the Fallen Circus."

1457
01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:00.332
You said. "Let's just
drive up to Big Bear."

1458
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.507
and I was like. "Don't you think
that we should look online?"

1459
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:03.749
But you didn't want me to know

1460
01:14:03.853 --> 01:14:05.371
that you didn't
have a credit card.

1461
01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.285
Oh. you're shredding
on the motherfucker.

1462
01:14:24.114 --> 01:14:26.082
And we couldn't even see
out of the back mirrors.

1463
01:14:26.185 --> 01:14:28.222
And then. all we could see
is through the rearview mirrors.

1464
01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:29.879
and you're like.
"No. no. it's fine.

1465
01:14:29.982 --> 01:14:31.881
I have eyes in the back
of my head."

1466
01:14:31.984 --> 01:14:34.090
But you missed the state trooper
that was coming along.

1467
01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:36.748
And you missed those
two raccoons that you hit. too.

1468
01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:38.163
Yeah. and then I was like...

1469
01:14:44.618 --> 01:14:46.827
- Can you reach that cocaine?
- Trying.

1470
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:50.486
Will you guys shut up?
I'm trying to make a hit record.

1471
01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:52.936
And then we went to that bar.
and you were like.

1472
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.560
"I want to get a yard of beer."
and I was like.

1473
01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:59.011
"Anytime that there is measuring
beers in distances.

1474
01:14:59.115 --> 01:15:02.152
it's probably not gonna end well
for your body. Bill."

1475
01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:28.178
"No. I don't want to eat
beef jerky for dinner."

1476
01:15:28.282 --> 01:15:32.597
but then. you came in with all
different kinds of beef jerky.

1477
01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.908
I mean. there was...

1478
01:15:34.012 --> 01:15:34.978
Yaah!

1479
01:15:43.366 --> 01:15:46.852
♪ And the goblin. I smell it

1480
01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:49.303
♪ You can try and hide

1481
01:15:49.406 --> 01:15:50.891
♪ Slip. slip

1482
01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:53.756
♪ But I will find you

1483
01:15:56.655 --> 01:15:59.244
William. I don't think
we have much time.

1484
01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:03.075
...basil and Texas barbecue.
And then there was...

1485
01:16:03.179 --> 01:16:05.526
Blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.
Blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.

1486
01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:08.943
Something's missing.
We're missing something.

1487
01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:12.878
What are you laughing at?

1488
01:16:12.982 --> 01:16:16.537
That you're never gonna
finish this album. Willy.

1489
01:16:16.641 --> 01:16:19.471
- What the fuck. Vlad?
- Motherfucker...

1490
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:22.370
I called the cops.
- Why?

1491
01:16:22.474 --> 01:16:23.682
Why?

1492
01:16:23.786 --> 01:16:27.168
Because there's no hope. Willy.

1493
01:16:27.272 --> 01:16:29.688
'Cause you're just like me.

1494
01:16:29.792 --> 01:16:32.657
Because you're a fucking loser.

1495
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.453
and you're gonna die
a fucking loser.

1496
01:16:38.663 --> 01:16:40.078
Don't listen to him. man.

1497
01:16:40.181 --> 01:16:42.701
- Right here with the loser...
- No. he's right.

1498
01:16:42.805 --> 01:16:44.323
...with his little band.

1499
01:16:44.427 --> 01:16:46.774
And no girlfriend
and a dead father

1500
01:16:46.878 --> 01:16:50.606
who always thought
you were a loser. Willy.

1501
01:16:55.921 --> 01:16:57.164
Yes.

1502
01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:06.829
You fucked Vlad!

1503
01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:09.383
And now Vladdy's gonna fuck you.

1504
01:17:09.486 --> 01:17:12.420
So what you gonna do. Brown?

1505
01:17:18.392 --> 01:17:20.739
I'm gonna do what I should've
done in the first place. Vlad.

1506
01:17:20.843 --> 01:17:23.604
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna ignore you.

1507
01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:25.917
You can't finish the album.
Willy.

1508
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.920
It's not perfect.

1509
01:17:30.335 --> 01:17:32.268
Actually. I think that's what's
gonna make it great.

1510
01:17:32.371 --> 01:17:34.235
What if you fail. Willy?

1511
01:17:34.339 --> 01:17:39.655
What if you make your music
and nobody gets it. Willy?

1512
01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:43.935
The right ones will.

1513
01:17:47.766 --> 01:17:49.492
Captain. do you hear that?

1514
01:17:49.595 --> 01:17:51.321
I'd recognize that
sound anywhere.

1515
01:17:51.425 --> 01:17:52.806
That's a Mobius Megatar.

1516
01:17:52.909 --> 01:17:54.531
She's stalling.
Get her out of there!

1517
01:17:54.635 --> 01:17:56.257
Will. they're coming!
They're coming!

1518
01:17:56.361 --> 01:17:58.501
Watch where you go!
Move. move. move. move. move!

1519
01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:05.611
Come. fight me. Willy!

1520
01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:07.648
Fight me like a man.

1521
01:18:07.752 --> 01:18:10.202
Real blood-and-guts shit!

1522
01:18:16.243 --> 01:18:19.177
Cops are here!
William. you're out of time!

1523
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.663
Stop it now!

1524
01:18:33.363 --> 01:18:37.540
Now that's what rock 'n' roll
is all abou--

1525
01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:39.266
Unh!

1526
01:18:39.369 --> 01:18:41.855
Hey.
That's that guy.

1527
01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:45.997
And the award for
Album of the Year goes to...

1528
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:49.207
William Brown.
"Calamities of Castles."

1529
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:51.934
We're sad that William
couldn't be here with us today.

1530
01:18:52.037 --> 01:18:54.246
but we're also grateful.

1531
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:59.458
Grateful that you fell in love
with his music and his legacy.

1532
01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:02.979
Frankly. we're a little
surprised at the success

1533
01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:06.120
of this album.
- But. also. we're thrilled.

1534
01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:08.260
And. William.
if you're out there

1535
01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:11.539
watching somewhere tonight.
we share this with you.

1536
01:19:11.643 --> 01:19:13.645
Yeah [bleep]

1537
01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.441
William Brown.
your lawyer's here.

1538
01:19:16.544 --> 01:19:18.995
- Yeah.
- Winning awards.

1539
01:19:19.099 --> 01:19:22.550
That's what rock 'n' roll
is all about.

1540
01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:32.768
Hey.

1541
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:37.013
- How are you?
- I'm alright. How are you?

1542
01:19:37.117 --> 01:19:38.566
Good.
I have some good news.

1543
01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:40.396
There's going to be an appeal.
which should be a chance

1544
01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:42.536
to get your sentence
knocked down a little bit.

1545
01:19:42.639 --> 01:19:44.089
- Hey.
- You know. three consecutive

1546
01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:46.298
life sentences just feels like
it's a little steep.

1547
01:19:46.402 --> 01:19:49.923
Yeah. I don't even know how
that works. uh. biologically.

1548
01:19:50.026 --> 01:19:51.579
You know. maybe we can get it

1549
01:19:51.683 --> 01:19:53.133
down to life without parole?

1550
01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:54.790
Yeah. with your one life.

1551
01:19:54.893 --> 01:19:56.274
- With my one life. yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1552
01:19:56.377 --> 01:19:58.897
Oh. I wanted to tell you.
this headphone company

1553
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:02.107
made me these. uh.
custom tiny headphones.

1554
01:20:02.211 --> 01:20:03.626
Oh. my God.

1555
01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:04.869
Are those
for your small ear canals?

1556
01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:05.904
Yeah. they made them
specifically

1557
01:20:06.008 --> 01:20:07.285
for my small canals.

1558
01:20:07.388 --> 01:20:08.665
They heard me talking about them
in an interview.

1559
01:20:08.769 --> 01:20:09.874
and they just sent them over.

1560
01:20:17.536 --> 01:20:20.470
Before I go. I just...

1561
01:20:20.574 --> 01:20:24.405
I just had one quick question.

1562
01:20:24.509 --> 01:20:26.442
Yeah. What's up?

1563
01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:29.755
How did you do it?

1564
01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.416
I thought we weren't supposed
to talk about the deaths...

1565
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.558
No. not that. No. I meant.
how did you finish the album?

1566
01:20:39.662 --> 01:20:43.286
I listened to it.
and it's really. really good.

1567
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:45.357
You know. with everything
that was going on.

1568
01:20:45.461 --> 01:20:47.359
how'd you do it?

1569
01:20:47.463 --> 01:20:51.225
- Yeah!

1570
01:20:51.329 --> 01:20:53.193
Well. let's just say
I had some help.

1571
01:20:53.296 --> 01:20:55.264
That makes you sound crazy.

1572
01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:58.198
It does. I know. I'm sorry.

1573
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.029
Oh. um. I. um-- I forgot.

1574
01:21:02.133 --> 01:21:04.238
