00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.354
Basically. our forte is harmonics.

4
00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:05.148
'cause there's a certain family blend.

5
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.868
Three brothers: Brian. Dennis and Carl.

6
00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:21.039
a cousin. Mike Love.
and our good friend Al Jardine.

7
00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.375
That's family to me.

8
00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.173
Ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.343
would you please welcome.
from Southern California.

10
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.347
America's band. The Beach Boys!

11
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.985
I like it. I like it.

12
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:03.331
<i>There is no other. There is only one.</i>

13
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.625
<i>They've broken records everywhere.</i>

14
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.211
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. The Beach Boys!</i>

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.214

<i>♪ Now that Daddy took the T-bird away ♪</i>

22
00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.780
The Beach Boys
just represented some sort of fantasy.

23
00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.325
It was a pure California phenomenon.

24
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.248
We've known each other
for a really long time.

25
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.043
And there really is a great deal
of fellowship in the group.

26
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.337
And we've been through an awful lot.

27
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:54.132
<i>♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? ♪</i>

28
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.011

29

30
00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.268
<i>♪ In the kind of world where we belong? ♪</i>

31
00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:10.357
It's kinda miraculous that
it's lasted for 60 years now.

32
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:15.445
But the fact that it was a family.
that's where the success came from.

33
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:25.872
{\an8}<i>♪ You know it seems

<i>♪ Good night. my baby ♪</i>

<i>Here we go.

41
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.828
<i>And watch me on that part now.</i>

42
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.079
<i>Twenty-eight.</i>

43
00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:16.089
When I assess the totality of it all.

44
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.384
The Beach Boys are a family story.

45
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.306
There has definitely been ups and downs.

46
00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:29.394
We've probably been counted out
as a group. um. half a dozen times.

47
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:38.611
When I was young.
I learned to sing harmony with my family.

48
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.406
That was a long time ago.

49
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:49.205
I remember the songs.
the lyrics. and a lot of fun.

50
00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.459
I'm very proud of my brothers.

51
00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.090
Let's try it
one more time from the top.

52
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.926
One. two. one. two...

53
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:08.808
<i>♪ M ♪</i>

54
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.810
<i>♪ I say M-O ♪</i>

55
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.314
I had two things
I wanted to do in my life.

56
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.567
One. I wanted to be a psychologist.
you know?

57
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.570
{\an8}And two. I wanted to be a baseball player.

58
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.073
<i>♪ Mop. mop. mop. mop ♪</i>

59
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.408
But I never really set music as my goal.

60
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.828
My dad and my mom always put on records.

61
00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:32.207
And I said.
"What's that? I love that sound!"

62
00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.212
My dad was a songwriter.

63
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.881
and he had a minor R & B hit.

64
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.925
But. you know.
my mom was actually the musician.

65
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.969
{\an8}so she would play and my dad would write.

66
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.222
{\an8}So there was a lot of music in the house.

67
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.434
My mom and dad
both really loved older tunes.

68
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.853
But I was more interested
with rock and roll.

69
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.984
<i>♪ In the heat of the day
down in Mobile. Alabama ♪</i>

70
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.113
And I'll never forget
the feeling in my body.

71
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.572
It was like electricity.

72
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.534
I'd never experienced
that kind of excitement.

73
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.496
Chuck Berry was the reason
I started playing the guitar.

74
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.874
<i>♪ Payday coming when my work is all done ♪</i>

75
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.132
On a social level.
I never really spent any time with Brian.

76
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:26.177
I spent more time with Carl.
Because I could beat Carl up.

77
00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.597
<i>♪ Everybody's scrambling
and jumping around ♪</i>

78
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.475
<i>♪ Picking up their money
Tearing the teepee down ♪</i>

79
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.229
Brian's influence on me
was his love for the music.

80
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.314
<i>♪ You have to let it roll on ♪</i>

81
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.194
First time I realized it was--

82
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.406
We used to sing three-part harmony
in the back seat of a car.

83
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.041
And that's the birth
of the three brothers singing together.

84
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.467
When I was about seven.

85
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:10.221
we moved into a house on the borderline
between Inglewood and Hawthorne.

86
00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:14.851
{\an8}And across the street from our house
was the Wilson house.

87
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:25.612
As we were moving in. Carl and Dennis
were throwing garbage and old car parts

88
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.696
across the street.

89
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:30.033
And saying.
"Inglewood sucks. Hawthorne rules!"

90
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.118
That was our introduction.

91
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.996
And I didn't like my parents very much.
so I hung out at the Wilsons'.

92
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.459
The Wilson household
was a tract home in Hawthorne.

93
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:43.296
{\an8}And the garage was converted
into a music room.

94
00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.966
And we would spend hours
listening to music and singing.

95
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.471
And the big event of the year
for us would be to go over to Mike Love's

96
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.933
at Christmastime because the Loves
would have a big Christmas caroling party.

97
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.690
Growing up as the first cousin
of the Wilsons.

98
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.276
it was such a family hobby
harmonizing together.

99
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.863
And we had a grand piano.
an organ and a harp in our living room.

100
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.785
Brian and I hit it off
because we were about a year apart in age.

101
00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.372
and we liked a lot of the same music.

102
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.499
A lot of the doo-wop. The Everly Brothers.

103
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.709
The Four Freshmen.

104
00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.797
The Four Freshmen were probably
the greatest four-part harmony group

105
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:26.965
{\an8}that ever lived.

106
00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.468
The notes were close together.
which gave it a warmth and a vibration.

107
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.596
It was a lot of fun singing together.

108
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:39.811
But Brian somehow figured out the chords
the Four Freshmen were doing just by ear.

109
00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.856
That was--
That was a whole different world.

110
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:51.197
Brian was spending hours every day
at the piano

111
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.118
just going over and over
these Four Freshmen arrangements.

112
00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:03.501
<i>♪ It's a blue world ♪</i>

113
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.919
I never quit.

114
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:09.466
{\an8}To where I knew that what was on
my piano was exactly on their record.

115
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:15.430
<i>♪ It's a blue world ♪</i>

116
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.974
I went and did that on. like.
20 different songs.

117
00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.978
which was my entire harmonic education.

118
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.152
Later on. he started making up
his own arrangements.

119
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.323
He would ask me to sing a harmony part
that he'd make up.

120
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.327
And I remember wanting to go out and play.
and he'd say. "Mom. make Carl sing."

121
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:43.166
Brian and I
were on the football team in high school.

122
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:47.712
And I'd heard his band
at the high school assembly.

123
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.507
and that's really
what got my brain going. "Wow!"

124
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:59.015
I was a guitar player. and I was
very impressed with his little quartet.

125
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.518
Including his brother Carl.

126
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.228
with Brian taking the falsetto.

127
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.563
And I thought we should hook up.

128
00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.818
We bumped into each other
after graduation.

129
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:13.822
Brian said. "You know. I think
I should introduce you to my brothers

130
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.825
and my cousin.
because we need more voices."

131
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:21.996
So he invited me over to the house.
and we all just clicked.

132
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.832
We were like notes on a keyboard.

133
00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.671
<i>Now. this time
let's sing it out naturally.</i>

134
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.297
- <i>Don't hold back.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

135
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.924
Al Jardine. actually. was

136
00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:38.221
the one person who could maintain
perfect pitch and changing harmonies

137
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.473
that were derivative of the Four Freshmen.

138
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.142
<i>Forget time and beat
and everything.</i>

139
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.352
<i>No! We don't want to forget beat.</i>

140
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.689
We assembled around the piano
as Brian and his brothers.

141
00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:51.526
{\an8}Plus me and his cousin Mike.
That was our band.

142
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.445
{\an8}Our first thing we ever learned

143
00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.448
was a tune called.
"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring."

144
00:10:56.448 --> 00:11:02.287
<i>♪ There's a story told ♪</i>

145
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:06.624
<i>♪ Of a very gentle boy ♪</i>

146
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.461
Brian would sing
the high part beautifully.

147
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.504
And I would sing the bass part.

148
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:15.925
And then Carl and Al Jardine
could sing really well and blend.

149
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.387
See. it wasn't only about the note.
It was about the blend.

150
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:25.393
You sublimate your individuality
to create this group harmony sound.

151
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:29.981
<i>♪ Their hearts were full of spring ♪</i>

152
00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.443
After that. we'd go.
"Hey. look out for us.

153
00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.195
{\an8}We really harmonize here."

154
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.365
Then we kind of went the other way.

155
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.418
Carl and I would hang out
every day after school.

156
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:53.421
And we were listening
to a lot of current surf stuff.

157
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.382
The Ventures.

158
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.008
The Marketts.

159
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.093
{\an8}Dick Dale.

160
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:07.310
Kids would go to the high-school
auditorium to watch surfing movies.

161
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.022
And that's what they were using
as background music.

162
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.907
Surfing was a big deal
in Southern California.

163
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:24.452
You dressed a certain way.
You talked a certain way.

164
00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:25.745
They had a certain attitude.

165
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.918
We all tried to surf.

166
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.629
but we could just
never really get the hang of it.

167
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.008
I went surfing down
on Manhattan Beach Pier.

168
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.262
It was a big day on the pier. man.
There were great big waves!

169
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.389
And the first thing I did
was lose my board.

170
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.476
And I almost drowned.
Brian was the same way.

171
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:52.147
I tried the one time. and the board missed
my head by that far.

172
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.316
I never tried again.

173
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.237
We were landlubbers.
but Dennis was the guy.

174
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.948
I was into surfing.

175
00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.451
{\an8}I was into cutting class.

176
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.036
sneaking off to the beach.

177
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.370
I love the ocean.

178
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.836
Dennis and I went
to the beach one time

179
00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:18.923
{\an8}and we came back to the Wilson house.
and Dennis brought it up to Brian.

180
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:23.428
he said. "Why don't we do something
lyrically about surfing?"

181
00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:29.434
At the time.
surf music was primarily instrumental.

182
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.020
The bands were instrumental bands.

183
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.065
So. I just got with Brian
and came up with...

184
00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.442
<i>♪ Surfin' is the only life
The only way for me ♪</i>

185
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.195
<i>♪ Now surf
Surf ♪</i>

186
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.618
The first time The Beach Boys
got together as a band to rehearse...

187
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.995
{\an8}my folks went to Mexico City on business.

188
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.665
They left us 200 bucks for food.

189
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.877
The money ran out immediately.

190
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.797
I said. "Brian.
we can't just sit around and sing.

191
00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.465
We gotta rent some instruments."

192
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:05.136
{\an8}So I said. "Well. I think my mother.
Virginia. would probably help us out

193
00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.680
{\an8}if we audition for her."

194
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.808
{\an8}We sang
"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring."

195
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.393
That was our go-to song.

196
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.103
And she was spellbound.

197
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.648
She gave us the $300
to rent the equipment.

198
00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:17.982
and she said. "Go for it."

199
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.777
Gives me chills just thinking about it.

200
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.281
<i>Put the monitor on.</i>

201
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.284
<i>♪ Surfin'. surfin' ♪</i>

202
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.871
<i>Hey. you're wasting tape.</i>

203
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.207
<i>Keep your heads up.</i>
and stay on it.

204
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.919
<i>♪ Surfin'. surfin' ♪</i>

205
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.964
Murry and Audree were only gone
for about two or three weeks.

206
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.549
but we-- we were a band by then.

207
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.301
He goes. "I thought that money
was supposed to be for food.

208
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.511
What are you guys doing?"

209
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.596
So we played him a song and he goes.
"Hey. I like that."

210
00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:53.143
My uncle Murry was actually the one
who got us in the studio.

211
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:56.438
<i>♪ So come along. baby. and surf ♪</i>

212
00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.233
<i>Okay. boys. Slating.

213
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.695
<i>♪ Surfin' is the only life

214
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:04.863
<i>♪ Now surf ♪</i>

215
00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.324
The first session.
Al played acoustic bass.

216
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.451
I played an acoustic guitar.

217
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.829
Brian played a drum with a pencil.

218
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.706
And Michael was on vocals.

219
00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:17.667
<i>♪ I got up this morning

220
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.337
<i>♪ I was checking out the surfin' scene

221
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:23.256
We were calling ourselves
The Pendletones.

222
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.009
Those were shirts that all the surfers
were wearing at the time.

223
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:30.013
And then somebody from the label
said. "The song is called 'Surfin'.'

224
00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.681
What about The Beach Boys?"

225
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.267
None of us really liked it.

226
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.313
And we got stuck with it.

227
00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:42.400
We put out "Surfin'"
on a small. independent label.

228
00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.528
A month later. we heard it on the radio.

229
00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:52.994
There was a radio station
that premiered. like. four songs a week.

230
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:57.165
And the one that got the most call-ins
won the contest.

231
00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.294
Well. we had a big family.

232
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:06.424
And they go. "The pick
of the week. 'Surfin'' by The Beach Boys!"

233
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.593
And we were out of our minds.

234
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.846
<i>♪ It's the latest dance craze ♪</i>

235
00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:12.931
<i>♪ We're going surfin' ♪</i>

236
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:17.310
"Surfin'" went to number two in LA.
and then we started getting gigs.

237
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.230
Played our first show on New Year's Eve.

238
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.940
In the midst of it all.

239
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.275
Dennis was learning the drums
quite proficiently.

240
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.527
I was really impressed.

241
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.612
The way it started out real fast.

242
00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.240
{\an8}we didn't have a chance to sit around
and think. "Hey. what happened?"

243
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.742
{\an8}We were already heading towards something
without really knowing it.

244
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.577
<i>♪ Surfin' is the only life ♪</i>

245
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.454
<i>♪ The only way for me ♪</i>

246
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:41.710
We had a hit record. Went to top 10 in LA.
and we were excited as hell.

247
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.295
But I felt like I-- I don't know.

248
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.798
I had to finish my education.
That's what I thought.

249
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.216
My brother is a lawyer.

250
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.927
My father has a business master's degree.
and my mother is--

251
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.470
You know. they all had degrees.

252
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.889
Just felt like I was out of place
for a while.

253
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.600
So I left the band to finish college.

254
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.187
It's the only time Brian
ever got upset with me.

255
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:09.404
I wasn't in the band.
but I'd been hanging around.

256
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.450
I was. like. 12.

257
00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.703
And Carl and I would play guitars
every day after school.

258
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.582
We were developing our own style.

259
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:25.837
And Brian. his ear picked up on that.

260
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.340
So. all of a sudden...

261
00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:31.593
{\an8}I was a Beach Boy.

262
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:40.643
After "Surfin'" was a hit.
Brian really wanted a career in music.

263
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:45.732
So my dad sold his business
and cleared the deck.

264
00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.486
and then went about getting us
a record label.

265
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.494
He went around all the record labels
in Hollywood.

266
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.288
Every one of them turned us down.

267
00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:05.543
Eventually. a man named Nick Venet.
who worked at Capitol Records.

268
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.629
heard the tape of our stuff.

269
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.383
They had a demo
of "Surfin' Safari."

270
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:17.013
And every once in a while. you know
that the record is a number one record.

271
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:22.143
And he goes. "Oh. God.
These records are goddamn smashes."

272
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.774
We were able to sign with
Capitol Records. which was a big deal.

273
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:28.858
Some great artists on it.

274
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:33.613
The Four Freshmen were on. and
Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. you know?

275
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.240
I said. "I quit college."

276
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.534
And my brothers said.
"We quit high school."

277
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.702
You know. we quit!

278
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.914
I was the only person
who didn't need the court approval.

279
00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:46.626
{\an8}I was 21 and everybody else
was quite a bit younger.

280
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.216
{\an8}And Capitol Records got us
in the studio immediately.

281
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:59.097
<i>Yeah. Hey. Dennis.
Don't forget that last verse. okay?</i>

282
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.976
That first recording session
was in the basement of Capitol Records.

283
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.355
<i>Here we go. 38221.</i>

284
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.525
At first. it was really
quite overwhelming. you know?

285
00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.902
{\an8}Just to watch the recording process.

286
00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.070
<i>We're speeding it a bit.</i>

287
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.072
<i>We're rushing it.
Slow it down a little bit.</i>

288
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.867
<i>Get the feel on the bass guitar.
Get that groove going.</i>

289
00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.326
<i>There we go. 38221.</i>

290
00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:27.500
Brian's brilliant harmonies. and me
and Carl playing garage grunge guitars.

291
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.794
People never heard anything like that.

292
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.047
<i>All right. This will be take one.</i>

293
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.175
<i>♪ Let's go surfin' now

298
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.772
Murry was our manager.
and he was good at promotion.

299
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:52.192
He would be handing out
pictures to kids in the parking lot.

<i>♪ Come on. baby

301
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.447

<i>♪ Come on and safari with ♪</i>

306
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:19.094
I grew up in Los Angeles.
but I never identified with beach culture.

307
00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.847
{\an8}And when I first heard
The Beach Boys' music.

308
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:26.059
{\an8}my response was to reject it.

309
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:29.562
They were part of a marketing blitz

310
00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.731
for a culture that
I wanted nothing to do with.

311
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.528
The song selection.
The way the album covers were shot.

312
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.780
It was a concocted image.

313
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.616
<i>♪ Let's go surfin' now

314
00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:48.206
And that image of the white.
blond Southern California teenager

315
00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.165
took off.

316
00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:56.089
{\an8}<i>♪ If everybody had an ocean

317
00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:02.053
{\an8}<i>♪ Then everybody'd be surfin'

318
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.056
But the more you listen
to the records they made.

319
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.307
it wasn't about that.

320
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.810
They went beyond surfing.

321
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.524
They were participating in the creation
of a California dream.

322
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:18.445
- <i>♪ You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Inside. outside USA ♪</i>

323
00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:22.365
I grew up in Detroit.
I had a paper route in the wintertime.

324
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.784
I walked to school in the wintertime.

325
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.579
And then on weekends.
I'd go see <i>Beach Blanket Bingo</i>.

326
00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.663
or one of those movies.

327
00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:33.335
{\an8}So. I was aware that there were places
that were warmer.

328
00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.589
<i>♪ Surfin' USA ♪</i>

329
00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:42.469
But the most articulate spokespeople
for the California dream

330
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.678
were The Beach Boys.

331
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:49.267
Man. they made me wanna go
to that place where they had cars

332
00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:52.520
and girls in bikinis and surf boards.

333
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.023
And sun and warmth.

334
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.941
I really wanted to be a part of that.

335
00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.820

336
00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.156
I grew up
in a very religious home.

337
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:06.493
so I was predominantly only allowed
to listen to gospel music.

338
00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.455
{\an8}But my mom was okay with me
playing The Beach Boys

339
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:13.583
{\an8}because she thought
they're positive. they're uplifting.

340
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:17.879
That was huge for me. um.
because I was obsessed at an early age

341
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.256
with getting out of Oklahoma.

342
00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:29.099
I think particularly landlocked states
dead center of the country.

343
00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:32.394
the appeal was even greater
because it was. like. foreign.

344
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.687
It's a foreign sound.

345
00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:40.610
<i>♪ Everybody's gone surfin' ♪</i>

You can listen to "Surfin' U.S.A.."

00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:58.503
It just hit America

352
00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:05.719
They were selling an image. and the music
was alive and vibrant and exciting.

353
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.306
All around the world.
people were listening to Beach Boy music.

354
00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:14.394
I was having this. like.
"Gosh. maybe I shouldn't have quit."

355
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:15.520
Then I got a call.

356
00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:19.524
Brian was frantic.
Says. "I can't do this."

357
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:22.235
He says. "You gotta come.
You gotta come back to the band."

358
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.612
Brian didn't like touring.

359
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:29.075
'cause all he wanted to do was stay home
and produce records and write songs.

360
00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:33.371
I was the only one Brian could
reach out to because I knew all the parts.

361
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:37.042
I thought. you know.
the guys really need me.

362
00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:38.293
I miss the music.

363
00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:40.211
{\an8}So I said. "Okay. Brian.

364
00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:43.715

368
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.519
I can remember
getting to Lake Minnetonka.

369
00:23:56.519 --> 00:24:00.065
People were breaking the windows
trying to get into the place.

370
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:04.194
And there's still a line of cars
about a mile or two down the road.

371
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.241
I remember the first time
we heard girls screaming.

372
00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:12.369
We thought there was a fire.

373
00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:13.661
We looked around.

374
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.833
We were all just.
you know. having a ball.

375
00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:22.796
And. meanwhile. Brian was able
to stay home and do his thing.

376
00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:26.758
He was writing a ton of songs.

377
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:28.635
And because we were on tour.

378
00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:31.596
I wasn't the only person writing with him
at that time.

379
00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:33.640
So he co-wrote things with others.

380

382
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:43.650
I enjoyed the road.
I thought it was fun.

383
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.403
But Murry wasn't a very fun road manager.

384
00:24:46.403 --> 00:24:49.030
<i>♪ I got the pink slip. Daddy ♪</i>

385
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.033
On many levels. Murry had a lot to do
with our success.

386
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:55.453
But Murry started to infringe
on the music.

387
00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:56.913
Oh. he would critique. all right.

388
00:24:56.913 --> 00:24:59.165
He said we didn't know what we were doing.

389
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:01.459
And we would have a certain sound in mind.

390
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:03.294
and he'd want it to be different.

391
00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:06.798
He would actually come onstage
and adjust my amp.

392
00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.384
Of course I'd go back
and put it the way I wanted it.

393
00:25:09.384 --> 00:25:13.221
And he'd call me over. and he ripped me
a new one for not smiling onstage.

394
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:15.181
or not having enough treble on my guitar.

395
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:20.020
Eventually. I just got mad at him
because he was yelling at me.

396
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.605
so I said. "I quit the band."

397
00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:26.192
And Murry goes. "Everybody hear that?
He quits the band."

398
00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:31.197
I loved Murry a lot.
but that wasn't really fair.

399
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.744
I was some arrogant 15-year-old.
What the hell do you expect?

400
00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:40.832
And so. after four albums as a Beach Boy.
that was over.

401
00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:45.587
Brian was totally upset. 'cause he knew
what the consequences were gonna be.

402
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:49.090
He would have to be on the road more
if I left.

403
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:00.268
When I was in high school.

404
00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:03.355
{\an8}my friend says.
"I know these guys called The Beach Boys."

405
00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:05.899
{\an8}"Would you like to see their show?"

407
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:14.616
I grew up in West Hollywood.

408
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.786
and there was this coffee house
called Pandora's Box.

409
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:20.246
We were sitting in the first row.

410
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.415
and I remember Brian looked at me
and he went.

411
00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.834
"Hey. can I have a sip
of your hot chocolate?"

412
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.671
I gave him a sip of it.
When he gave it back to me.

413
00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:29.923
it spilled on me.

414
00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:32.759
It was funny.

415
00:26:36.388 --> 00:26:39.057
You know. before long. I was dating Brian.

416
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:43.061

I mean. he was so much fun.

419
00:26:46.898 --> 00:26:49.693
But he was very cerebral
when it came to music.

420
00:26:50.402 --> 00:26:51.444
And. at the time.

421
00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:55.365
I was singing with my cousin Ginger
and my sister Diane.

422
00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.326
So we started making records with Brian
and for Capitol.

<i>♪ Girl. surfer girl

427
00:27:11.006 --> 00:27:13.967
Brian would tell me that he just wanted
to be home and make records.

428
00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.301
you know. and write and all that.

429
00:27:16.011 --> 00:27:18.179
And the guys had a hard time
understanding that.

430
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:20.432
because. you know.
going out on the road was fun.

431
00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:23.226
But it wasn't fun for Brian.

432
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:28.606
I mean. I've tried to work
around people. and I can do it.

433
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:31.026
It's a little hard. you know?

434
00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:33.445
But when I go alone. I can think.

435
00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:35.280

I think that music

441
00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:05.810
It puts me into a quiet place

442
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.063
to create or to do
what I'm supposed to do.

443
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:11.358
I've worked with Brian.

444
00:28:11.358 --> 00:28:15.111
and the way to talk with him
is through the language of music.

445
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:17.280
You can get close to him that way.

446
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.408
That's a secret language.

447
00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:25.038
And I think Mike understood
the complexity of Brian.

448
00:28:26.247 --> 00:28:29.334
<i>♪ In my room ♪</i>

449
00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:32.754
Whereas Brian
was innately gifted musically.

450
00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:35.632
I was more into the lyrics
and the concepts.

451
00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:38.385
And so it was a good partnership there.

452
00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:43.932
Some people maybe denigrate them
for those early songs being simple.

453
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:45.975
But I think that's a virtue.

454
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:50.313
Songs about having fun and love
and unrequited love.

455
00:28:50.313 --> 00:28:53.191
It was perfect music for a teenager. man.

456
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:55.735
They could understand that.
They could relate to it.

457
00:28:55.735 --> 00:28:56.820
They could feel it.

458
00:28:57.362 --> 00:28:59.823
Simplicity is what got us going.

459
00:29:05.954 --> 00:29:09.207
With Brian's wonderful ability
to write melodies

460
00:29:09.207 --> 00:29:11.960
and Mike's very clever way
of writing lyrics.

461
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.962
we found a perfect formula.

462
00:29:14.754 --> 00:29:17.215
But when it got to the point
of going onstage.

463
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:19.634
Mike was lead singer.

464
00:29:19.634 --> 00:29:20.802

<i>♪ I ride a big. white horse ♪</i>

471
00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:43.033
Ultimately.
I think Brian was melancholy.

472
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:47.120
{\an8}So I complemented Brian's melancholy
with my upbeatness.

473

All the guys
loved that Mike was so funny.

You know. I mean. they would really
give off of each other.

478
00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:03.053
And Brian thought
that Mike was the greatest front man.

479
00:30:03.803 --> 00:30:08.266
I. personally. always preferred live music
to the studio.

480
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.019
There's no feedback in the studio.

481
00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:16.566
But in live music. you see the effect that
the music has on the people immediately.

482
00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:20.403

came into the popular consciousness

490
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.454
with the mythology of surfing
and the California lifestyle.

491
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.917

<i>♪ Baby. please let me wonder ♪</i>

493

Those of us who lived up

494
00:31:24.217 --> 00:31:29.222
tended to be somewhat opinionated
about Los Angeles.

495
00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:34.644
But what made the group transcend that
was they had this guy Brian Wilson.

496
00:31:35.812 --> 00:31:41.109
I was quite taken with him as a craftsman.
as a producer.

497
00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:44.821
And as much as I've been influenced
by Brian's music.

498
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:51.119
Brian was equally influenced by
the amazing songs coming on the radio

499
00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:52.287
at that time.

500
00:31:52.287 --> 00:31:55.040
<i>♪ For so long I thought about it ♪</i>

501
00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:59.044
<i>Phil Spector is 25 years old.</i>

502
00:31:59.044 --> 00:32:03.048
{\an8}<i>He owns record and publishing companies
valued in the millions.</i>

503
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:04.883
<i>Dozens of hit records since</i>

504
00:32:04.883 --> 00:32:09.387
<i>indicate that Spector's beat
is closely tuned to teen desire.</i>

505
00:32:10.972 --> 00:32:13.475
Was Spector a big inspiration to you?

506
00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:15.560
Are you kidding? Are you kidding?

507
00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:19.189
He was like a-- He was it.

508
00:32:20.982 --> 00:32:24.819
I was in my car with my girlfriend.
All of a sudden. this radio station goes.

509
00:32:24.819 --> 00:32:27.906
"Here we go with
'Be My Baby' by the Ronettes."

510
00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:34.037
{\an8}<i>♪ The night we met
I knew I needed you so ♪</i>

511
00:32:34.037 --> 00:32:40.377
After he heard "Be My Baby."
he played that record every single day.

512
00:32:40.377 --> 00:32:42.837
Drove me absolutely nuts.

513
00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:46.216
<i>♪ So won't you say you love me? ♪</i>

514
00:32:46.216 --> 00:32:48.760
Phil Spector's music
was intangible.

515
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.097
He knew how to mix.
who knows. probably 25 instruments?

516
00:32:52.722 --> 00:32:56.935
He mixes 'em all into one sound. and
that was what he called the Wall of Sound.

517
00:32:56.935 --> 00:32:59.396
<i>♪ Be my. be my baby ♪</i>

518
00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:02.315
- <i>♪ Be my little baby ♪</i>
- <i>♪ My one and only baby ♪</i>

519
00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:03.692
It got to my soul.

520
00:33:03.692 --> 00:33:05.944
<i>♪ Say you'll be my darling ♪</i>

521
00:33:05.944 --> 00:33:09.781
- <i>♪ Be my. be my baby ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Be my baby now ♪</i>

522
00:33:09.781 --> 00:33:12.367
<i>♪ Whoa. oh. oh. oh ♪</i>

523
00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:14.953
When Brian heard "Be My Baby."

524
00:33:14.953 --> 00:33:17.914
{\an8}he says. "I gotta have that band.
Those are the guys."

525
00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:20.750
I played on "Be My Baby"

526
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.920
{\an8}with a group of session musicians
called the Wrecking Crew.

527
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.007
{\an8}We were the band
that was making those hit records.

528
00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:31.344
Before that. most of the studio musicians
were all in the suits.

529
00:33:31.344 --> 00:33:32.303
and nobody smoked.

530
00:33:33.096 --> 00:33:36.933
Here we came
and everybody was making jokes. relaxed.

531
00:33:36.933 --> 00:33:39.561
The story goes like. "These guys
are gonna wreck the business."

532
00:33:40.687 --> 00:33:45.650
Phil Spector had three keyboard
players all playing the same part.

533
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.362
Five guitar players. Three bass players.

534
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:51.906
Everyone's bleeding
into all the microphones.

535
00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:54.617
And he built this monolith of music.

536
00:33:54.617 --> 00:33:57.370
<i>♪ Whoa. oh. oh. oh. oh ♪</i>

537
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.790
I was unable
to really think as a producer

538
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.044
up until the time I really got familiar
with Phil Spector's work.

539
00:34:04.044 --> 00:34:06.796
Then I started to see the point
of the whole game.

540
00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:08.673
It's the overall sound.

541
00:34:08.673 --> 00:34:10.675
It's what they're going to hear
and experience

542
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:12.427
in the two and a half minutes that counts.

543
00:34:12.427 --> 00:34:15.805
- <i>♪ Be my. be my baby ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Be my little baby ♪</i>

544
00:34:15.805 --> 00:34:18.391
Brian really wanted
to produce his own records.

545
00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:20.101
{\an8}and that was a big step at that time.

546
00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:22.479
{\an8}Capitol Records really resisted it.

547
00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:26.149
They weren't certain that
he'd be able to really deliver.

548
00:34:30.653 --> 00:34:34.908
When you're 21. especially in that era.
you needed to have an adult in the room.

549
00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:36.201
There was a method to things.

550
00:34:38.244 --> 00:34:40.997
Capitol wanted
to have their person in there.

551
00:34:40.997 --> 00:34:44.668
{\an8}and so Nick Venet
was assigned as our producer.

552
00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:47.045
{\an8}But that was very unsatisfactory.

553
00:34:47.545 --> 00:34:48.546
Especially to Brian.

554
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.549
He didn't really do much except just.

555
00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:53.718
"Okay. fellas. Take one and take"--
You know?

556
00:34:53.718 --> 00:34:56.262
{\an8}<i>The tower's three recording studios</i>

557
00:34:56.262 --> 00:34:58.098
{\an8}<i>are the most modern in the world.</i>

558
00:34:58.098 --> 00:34:59.891
They want us to use
their recording studio.

559
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:02.394
and we didn't care too much for the sound
at the tower.

560
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.191
I preferred a studio called
Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard.

561
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:12.237
So my dad told Capitol that we're leaving.

562
00:35:12.237 --> 00:35:16.658
<i>I remember Murry argued
with Capitol for five straight months.</i>

563
00:35:16.658 --> 00:35:21.496
<i>I could hear his voice just screaming.
but Murry got his way.</i>

564
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.332
Had he been unrelated
to the group.

565
00:35:24.332 --> 00:35:27.168
{\an8}I could've probably seen
my way through the arguments.

566
00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:29.337
{\an8}But because he was blood related.

567
00:35:29.337 --> 00:35:32.090
whenever I told him
he was wrong or foolish.

568
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.011
the entire band took it
as a slander against the family.

569
00:35:38.638 --> 00:35:41.391
And from then on.
we produced our own records.

570
00:35:51.735 --> 00:35:53.570
Growing up in Kansas City. Kansas.

571
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.991
{\an8}my grandmother would go to thrift stores
and get all these dusty vinyls.

572
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:06.291
And I just remember seeing The Beach Boys.
and I'm like. "What the hell is that?"

573
00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:09.544
<i>♪ Well. it's been building up
inside of me ♪</i>

574
00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:14.215
<i>♪ For. oh. I don't know how long ♪</i>

575
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:15.592
When I got into songwriting.

576
00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:18.636
that's when I really started
to listen to The Beach Boys.

577
00:36:19.637 --> 00:36:21.598
'cause I was so obsessed
with the harmonies.

578
00:36:21.598 --> 00:36:24.684
- <i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>
- <i>♪ But she looks in my eyes ♪</i>

579
00:36:24.684 --> 00:36:27.354
They really show what it's like

580
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:29.939
when everybody understands the part
they have to play.

581
00:36:29.939 --> 00:36:35.779
<i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>

582
00:36:35.779 --> 00:36:40.116
- <i>♪ Everything will turn out all right ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>

583
00:36:40.116 --> 00:36:45.205
<i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>

584
00:36:48.124 --> 00:36:55.048
<i>♪ I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car ♪</i>

585
00:36:56.257 --> 00:37:00.762
There's something about those individuals
and the way they blended together.

586
00:37:00.762 --> 00:37:02.847
They're all part of it.

587
00:37:02.847 --> 00:37:05.016
You take any one of those guys out.

588
00:37:05.016 --> 00:37:07.894
and you don't have
that sound or that feel.

589
00:37:07.894 --> 00:37:11.898
<i>♪ And makes me wanna drive when she says ♪</i>

590
00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:14.150
<i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>

591
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.654
- <i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Don't worry. baby ♪</i>

592
00:37:17.654 --> 00:37:19.489
<i>♪ Everything will turn out all right ♪</i>

593
00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:21.783
I remember the recording session
for "Don't Worry Baby."

594
00:37:21.783 --> 00:37:23.702
I go. "Holy shit. This is beautiful."

595
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.787
Definitely a turning point for us.

596
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:27.956
And for Brian.

597
00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:31.543
He knew exactly what he wanted.

598
00:37:32.127 --> 00:37:34.379
He was really learning to be a producer.

599
00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:36.673
But his dad began to be an obstacle.

600
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.636
<i>Sit up straight. Carl.</i>
and you can play.

601
00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:43.179
- <i>You're laying down.</i>
<i>That thing's on.</i>

602
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:45.849
It's tough to manage your sons.
so I don't know how you can...

603
00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:49.352
...travel with them
and be their road manager.

604
00:37:49.352 --> 00:37:52.939
And their manager manager.
It just-- It just was very difficult.

605
00:37:54.774 --> 00:37:56.609
He would come to a concert.

606
00:37:56.609 --> 00:38:01.322
then told Brian to not use the sound
on the bass that he wanted to use.

607
00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:03.491
He'd give us these signals
from the back of the hall.

608
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:04.743
He'd have his flashlight too.

609
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.830
But the flashlight under his face.
and he looked like Boris Karloff.

610
00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:15.086
We're young guys in a rock band
who wanna have a certain sound onstage.

611
00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:17.839
And here's the dad over there.

612
00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:21.092
<i>♪ The sunset at night ♪</i>

613
00:38:21.092 --> 00:38:24.429
He would literally go like this.
it means T for treble.

614
00:38:24.429 --> 00:38:25.513
Treble up.

615
00:38:25.513 --> 00:38:29.768
Treble up. and also we had to humble up.
That was another one of his big sayings.

616
00:38:29.768 --> 00:38:32.645
<i>What's the matter?
You made too much money. buddy?</i>

617
00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:35.607
{\an8}- <i>Let's sing from your hearts. Let's go.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

618
00:38:35.607 --> 00:38:38.318
If they didn't do something right.
he would fine them.

619
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:40.362
Or if someone swore. he would fine them.

620
00:38:40.362 --> 00:38:41.488
It was so stupid.

621
00:38:42.947 --> 00:38:45.116
Brian did always
want his father's approval.

622
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:49.204
But it got to the point where he really
didn't want Murry to tell him what to do.

623
00:38:49.204 --> 00:38:53.625
because. you know. Murry's making music
from the '30s and '40s.

624
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:57.545
Brian said. "Oh. he's so corny
all the time. I can't. He's corny."

625
00:38:58.338 --> 00:39:00.298
{\an8}<i>The boys just really weren't happy.</i>

626
00:39:01.049 --> 00:39:04.052
{\an8}<i>And Murry wasn't happy either.
He was miserable most of the time.</i>

627
00:39:07.138 --> 00:39:08.973
We went to Australia for a tour.

628
00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:12.394
That might have been the turning point.

629
00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:16.731
Just a lot of arguing.
A lot of arguments that we had with him.

630
00:39:16.731 --> 00:39:19.109
We finally said.
"Look. we can't deal with you anymore.

631
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:21.861
We gotta let you go
and get a new-- get a new manager."

632
00:39:22.862 --> 00:39:27.575
Brian and I made that decision.
and Murry took over the publishing.

633
00:39:29.077 --> 00:39:30.745
But he was no longer our manager.

634
00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:34.582
Murry protected them from day one.

635
00:39:34.582 --> 00:39:38.211
You know. if Murry wasn't there
and wasn't protecting them.

636
00:39:38.211 --> 00:39:40.839
I don't think they would be anywhere
where they are right now.

637
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.007
In fact. I know they wouldn't.

638
00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:46.302
And so he was real. real hurt.

639
00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:49.180
That was traumatic for him.
- It was terrible.

640
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.932
It hurt his feelings very much.

641
00:39:52.767 --> 00:39:55.186
The firing was very hard on Audree.

642
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:58.732
because Murry would. you know.
come down on her all the time.

643
00:39:58.732 --> 00:40:01.526
You know.
"Because you were too soft with them."

644
00:40:02.777 --> 00:40:04.779
<i>I just wanted them
always to be better.</i>

645
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:07.073
{\an8}<i>Always to be stronger.</i>

646
00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:08.742
{\an8}<i>Always be honest.</i>

647
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:11.119
<i>God. they heard that enough.</i>

648
00:40:12.954 --> 00:40:14.414
I was never scared of my brothers.

649
00:40:14.414 --> 00:40:16.249
{\an8}I was scared of my dad though.
I'll tell you that.

650
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:19.878
{\an8}He'd clobber me right in the face
for not getting the dishes done.

651
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:25.425
{\an8}- At times. he was extremely--
- Depending on what he was hitting you with

652
00:40:25.425 --> 00:40:26.760
at the time. you know?

653
00:40:27.385 --> 00:40:31.139
He used a little thin board on Carl.
and he used a big one on me.

654
00:40:32.182 --> 00:40:33.767
Carl was the baby.

655
00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:36.978
And Brian.
"Well. Brian is different. Dennis."

656
00:40:36.978 --> 00:40:39.064
You know. and he said.
"You can take it." Boom!

657
00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:41.524
He was very abusive.

658
00:40:41.524 --> 00:40:46.237
{\an8}and I think that dealt some
severe self-worth issues to his sons.

659
00:40:46.946 --> 00:40:50.325
Showed up in Brian in one way.
and showed up in Carl another way.

660
00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:53.244
He developed a real guarded personality.

661
00:40:53.953 --> 00:40:56.122
And then Dennis was a rebel.

662
00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:00.543
When he grew up
into The Beach Boys.

663
00:41:00.543 --> 00:41:03.463
man. let me tell you.
he was really a spark plug.

664
00:41:03.963 --> 00:41:05.173
A real spark plug.

665
00:41:10.053 --> 00:41:12.472
In a sense.
the spotlight was on Dennis.

666
00:41:12.472 --> 00:41:14.391
He was the sex symbol of the group.

667
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.685
So a lot of us had to take it
right where it hurt.

668
00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:19.646
It's like. "Mob the stage. Look out!
Get out of the way. We want Dennis.

669
00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:22.691
- Will you please move that bass. Brian?"

670
00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:26.111
<i>♪ Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight? ♪</i>

671
00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:28.780
<i>♪ Hold me. baby. all through the night ♪</i>

672
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:34.786
<i>♪ Oh. baby. do you wanna dance? ♪</i>

673
00:41:35.704 --> 00:41:38.540
The way Dennis played
the drums. it was Dennis's drums.

674
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.917
I think that made a lot
of the records too.

675
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.713
He was energetic. boy.
A lot of power.

676
00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:45.714
Whoo!

677
00:41:47.132 --> 00:41:49.592
He was a real beach boy.
He really surfed.

678
00:41:49.592 --> 00:41:51.720
He really did what we were singing about.

679
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.223
But that issue was that he'd rather be
in the water than in the studio.

680
00:41:55.223 --> 00:41:58.476
<i>♪ Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight? ♪</i>

681
00:41:58.476 --> 00:42:01.312

<i>♪ Oh. baby. do you wanna dance? ♪</i>

683
00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:15.869
Dennis had all the cars and all the girls.
You know. the whole thing.

684
00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:23.376
He enjoyed being a beach boy.

685
00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:30.258
<i>We're The Beach Boys.
and we'd like to thank all the guys at...</i>

686
00:42:30.967 --> 00:42:32.969
We were in New Zealand for a tour.

687
00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:35.388
We were doing some spots
for the station there.

688
00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:38.600
and the deejay said.
"Hey. there's a new band from England

689
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.393
taking over America."

690
00:42:40.393 --> 00:42:42.520
We go. "Well. it's okay."

691
00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:51.488
<i>3.000 screaming teenagers

692
00:42:51.488 --> 00:42:53.156
<i>to meet The Beatles.</i>

693
00:42:53.156 --> 00:42:54.949
<i>This rock-and-roll group has taken over</i>

694
00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:58.703
<i>as the kingpins of musical appreciation
among the younger element.</i>

695
00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:02.874
I first heard 'em on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>.

696
00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:04.959
And I was flippin' out.

697
00:43:06.503 --> 00:43:08.004
Pretty jealous. I remember that.

698
00:43:08.797 --> 00:43:11.549
{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen. The Beatles.
Bring 'em on!

699
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:16.721
Here we are
in this remote part of the world.

700
00:43:16.721 --> 00:43:18.473
and they're on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>.

701
00:43:19.224 --> 00:43:20.975
We were completely caught off guard.

702
00:43:22.644 --> 00:43:28.066
It was very humbling. because we had been
on top there for that year or so before.

703
00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:30.527
Think I was just as amazed as anyone.

704
00:43:32.028 --> 00:43:34.447
Couldn't understand
how something like that could happen.

705
00:43:35.365 --> 00:43:36.449
The Beatles.

706
00:43:40.954 --> 00:43:42.372
The music they made--

707
00:43:42.372 --> 00:43:45.625
"I Wanna Hold Your Hand." for example.
wasn't really that great a record.

708
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:48.503
But they-- But they got screamed at.

709
00:43:50.338 --> 00:43:54.259
They were selling an image like
we were. but we had different approaches.

710
00:43:55.176 --> 00:43:58.763
They were a little crude.
because we were so. you know. refined.

711
00:43:58.763 --> 00:44:02.017
Everything with us was pitch-perfect.
You know?

712
00:44:02.892 --> 00:44:05.311
We were singers. They were players.
That's what it felt like.

713
00:44:06.396 --> 00:44:08.398
It was just
a different level of energy.

714
00:44:10.525 --> 00:44:11.776
It got us off our asses.

715
00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:15.155
It got us right off our asses
and in the studio.

716
00:44:15.822 --> 00:44:16.823
We started cuttin'.

717
00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:18.908
and said.
"Look. don't worry about The Beatles.

718
00:44:18.908 --> 00:44:20.785
We'll cut our own stuff.
Don't worry about it."

719
00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:23.663

723
00:44:39.971 --> 00:44:42.223

00:44:42.223 --> 00:44:44.726
Always has been. Always will be.

725
00:44:45.894 --> 00:44:48.730
And you always hope
the song is gonna be number one.

726
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.440
but there's too much competition.

727
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.275

<i>♪ Well. I saw her yesterday ♪</i>

733
00:45:12.504 --> 00:45:16.091
We'd put a song out.
Brian would hear it. then he'd do one.

734
00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:18.885
And we ended up--
It was kind of like a rivalry.

735
00:45:18.885 --> 00:45:21.429
You know. you kind of try
and top each other all the time.

736
00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:25.225

The surfing sound.
A tremendous rage over there.

745
00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.374
And it's been
quite a big success here too.

{\an8}but for anybody who might not.
may we introduce you by name?

766
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.040
{\an8}- Al Jardine.
- Thank you. Al.

767
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.291
{\an8}- Dennis Wilson.
- Thank you.

768
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:14.668
Brian Wilson.

769
00:47:14.668 --> 00:47:16.586
- Carl Wilson.
- Mike Love.

770
00:47:16.586 --> 00:47:18.838
- Now. I think. uh-- Whoop. What happened?

771
00:47:18.838 --> 00:47:19.839
There you are.

772
00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:22.550
You know it's an amazing thing
because you have hit after hit.

773
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.637
Who determines. Brian.
what will be done next?

774
00:47:26.429 --> 00:47:28.598
- Well. I guess I do. I don't know.

775
00:47:28.598 --> 00:47:31.768
I write the songs and produce them.
so I have a lot to say about it.

776
00:47:31.768 --> 00:47:33.019
Do you have a...

777
00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:36.690
There was so much
on him all the time as he got older.

778
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.525
Because Brian could write.

779
00:47:38.525 --> 00:47:40.568
He could arrange.

780
00:47:40.568 --> 00:47:41.903
He could sing.

781
00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:44.322
He could play instruments.

782
00:47:44.322 --> 00:47:45.615
He could do everything.

783
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:49.119
But the other parts of life
were hard for him.

784
00:47:54.624 --> 00:47:57.794
Being on the road.
it's ever-changing.

785
00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:01.339
He just wasn't cut out for that.

786
00:48:02.632 --> 00:48:03.925
He was more of a homebody.

787
00:48:06.428 --> 00:48:11.182
The toll that it takes on your body.
your family. your mental health.

788
00:48:11.182 --> 00:48:12.767
your physical health.

789
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:14.561
it's not natural.

790
00:48:15.145 --> 00:48:18.314
And if you're a homebody whatsoever.
it will destroy you.

791
00:48:19.274 --> 00:48:21.443
I remember him crying one morning.

792
00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:24.029
And he said. "I can't take it anymore."

793
00:48:25.447 --> 00:48:28.950
December of '64.
we were taking a flight to Houston.

794
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.495
and he had
a nervous breakdown on the flight.

795
00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:35.707
We were sitting next to each other.

796
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:39.502
I was terrified for my brother.

797
00:48:39.502 --> 00:48:43.840
To see my brother in a position
where... [sighs] ...he was frightened.

798
00:48:45.008 --> 00:48:47.677
By the time we landed.
he wanted to go home.

799
00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:53.975
We were already
married. but it's funny he didn't call me.

800
00:48:53.975 --> 00:48:55.143
He called his mom.

801
00:48:55.769 --> 00:48:57.520
You know. and he went to their house.

802
00:48:58.646 --> 00:49:00.482
By the next day. he was fine again.

803
00:49:01.107 --> 00:49:03.360
He just went. you know.
"I just can't do it anymore. Mar.

804
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.444
I just can't do it."

805
00:49:05.195 --> 00:49:07.447
When we got home
from the 1964 tour. I quit.

806
00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:10.075
I told them I was gonna stay home
and write music for them.

807
00:49:10.075 --> 00:49:12.160
and they can go out and tour.
And they didn't agree.

808
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.246
I remember Michael was very upset.
He had tears in his eyes.

809
00:49:15.747 --> 00:49:20.794
It was not fun to deal with.
but. as a cousin or friend.

810
00:49:20.794 --> 00:49:24.714
you don't want him to have to do something
if he doesn't want to.

811
00:49:24.714 --> 00:49:27.884
or if he's not capable of doing it
without harming himself.

812
00:49:28.718 --> 00:49:32.013
So we agreed he was gonna depart
from the touring group.

813
00:49:32.514 --> 00:49:35.266
and focus more on--
on the recording part of it.

814
00:49:35.266 --> 00:49:36.643
<i>Take six.</i>

815
00:49:36.643 --> 00:49:39.187
The idea was that Brian
would have the tracks

816
00:49:39.187 --> 00:49:41.272
- prepared for us all ready to sing.

817
00:49:41.272 --> 00:49:43.566
So that we could just come home
and do the vocals.

818
00:49:44.442 --> 00:49:47.028
We were pretty damn busy.
So he hired the Wrecking Crew.

819
00:49:48.113 --> 00:49:50.782
That's super intimidating as a producer.

820
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:53.243
Especially if you're dealing
with the Wrecking Crew.

821
00:49:53.243 --> 00:49:57.872
It's like everyone in this room
is a better musician than me.

822
00:49:58.915 --> 00:50:02.961
But we were all maybe 12.
15 years older than Brian.

823
00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:06.881
{\an8}And we thought. uh. you know.
it's a great account. Capitol Records.

824
00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:10.385
Brian. though.
had something special from the start.

825
00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:13.471
{\an8}'cause we didn't have to make up
as much stuff

826
00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:15.140
{\an8}for him as we did the other groups.

827
00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.725
{\an8}And-- And he brought in parts.

828
00:50:16.725 --> 00:50:19.227
I mean.
they weren't written out very well.

829
00:50:19.227 --> 00:50:21.646
which made me believe that
he was not schooled or anything.

830
00:50:21.646 --> 00:50:23.440
but the other groups didn't do that.

831
00:50:24.566 --> 00:50:27.569
Brian. for some reason.
knew how to manage us.

832
00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:30.030
{\an8}How to get the message across.

833
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.406
He just took over.

834
00:50:31.406 --> 00:50:32.741
That's all. He was the boss.

835
00:50:33.867 --> 00:50:37.412
I couldn't believe
how much greater making music was

836
00:50:37.412 --> 00:50:38.913
{\an8}when I did have the time.

837
00:50:38.913 --> 00:50:43.418
I didn't feel like I was being pressed
to make something in an unnatural way.

838
00:50:45.962 --> 00:50:48.465
But we still had to find
a replacement Beach Boy.

839
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.509
And Glen Campbell was
in our Wrecking Crew band.

840
00:50:52.177 --> 00:50:54.596
Why don't we call Glen
and ask him to come out?

841
00:50:54.596 --> 00:50:58.350
{\an8}I said. "What you want me to do?"
He said. "Play bass. Sing the high part."

842
00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.438
{\an8}I didn't know all the words.
but it seemed to work out fine.

843
00:51:04.022 --> 00:51:06.232
He was a studio-trained musician.

844
00:51:06.232 --> 00:51:08.234
So he had no idea what fame was all about.

845
00:51:08.818 --> 00:51:10.737
As he steps outside
of the dressing room door.

846
00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:14.407
all of a sudden this gaggle of girls
scared the living crap out of him.

847
00:51:15.658 --> 00:51:18.036
I was just moseying back to the car.

848
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:20.663
and. boy howdy. here come
a bunch of screaming teenagers.

849
00:51:20.663 --> 00:51:23.750
And they tore my shirt off
and got a few locks of hair.

850
00:51:24.626 --> 00:51:25.960
And it was really weird.

851
00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:29.756
From that day on. I was the first one
in the car. I can tell you that.

852
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:34.928
We were happy
Brian had the Wrecking Crew.

853
00:51:34.928 --> 00:51:37.931
'Cause then if we'd come home
from a 30-day tour.

854
00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:39.599
I could at least get a little rest.

855
00:51:40.225 --> 00:51:41.851
We were exhausted.

856
00:51:41.851 --> 00:51:44.354
<i>I'm ready now. I'm sorry. Brian.</i>

857
00:51:44.354 --> 00:51:45.438
<i>Is that a good tone?</i>

858
00:51:46.606 --> 00:51:48.942
Carl used to come
and play with us quite often.

859
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:51.027
<i>One. two. three.</i>
- But Carl was the only one.

860
00:51:51.027 --> 00:51:53.405
<i>♪ Hi. little girl
It's me ♪</i>

861
00:51:53.405 --> 00:51:56.324
<i>♪ Don't you know who I am? ♪</i>

862
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.078
<i>♪ I met you last summer ♪</i>

863
00:52:00.078 --> 00:52:01.496
I was very in awe of them.

864
00:52:02.247 --> 00:52:03.748
{\an8}And it was a great thrill.

865
00:52:03.748 --> 00:52:07.252
because we rehearsed a lot more
in the early days.

866
00:52:07.252 --> 00:52:12.090
But by then. it became more of
an experimental type of recording.

867
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.174
trial and error.

868
00:52:14.134 --> 00:52:16.803
Things would evolve in a
real organic sort of way.

869
00:52:17.595 --> 00:52:19.597
I just really loved being a part of that.

870
00:52:20.432 --> 00:52:22.976
Carl was very musically inclined.

871
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:25.603
Of course. he was lead guitarist.

872
00:52:26.855 --> 00:52:29.274
in addition to having
the voice of an angel.

873
00:52:29.274 --> 00:52:31.651
<i>♪ Said I'm the guy ♪</i>

874
00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:36.823
<i>♪ Who left you with tears in his eyes ♪</i>

875
00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:38.408
<i>♪ You didn't answer my... ♪</i>

876
00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:42.412
Carl was the sweet one.
And. you know. shy.

877
00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:44.748
But he had a heart of gold.

878
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.001
And he became the glue in The Beach Boys.

879
00:52:49.169 --> 00:52:52.839
My role in the band
has always been a support role.

880
00:52:52.839 --> 00:52:54.549
{\an8}And it's changed
through the years because.

881
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:56.593
with our evolution
and Brian leaving the road.

882
00:52:56.593 --> 00:52:58.928
I kinda took over
as the leader of the band.

883
00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:03.933
The Beach Boys
effectively became two groups.

884
00:53:03.933 --> 00:53:06.478
{\an8}The recording group and the touring group.

885
00:53:09.439 --> 00:53:10.940
Brian was happy as a lark.

886
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.526
He didn't have to be
under all that pressure anymore.

887
00:53:13.526 --> 00:53:17.405
The next call I got from him.
he couldn't wait for us to get home

888
00:53:17.405 --> 00:53:19.532
so he could go into the studio
and do the next album.

889
00:53:19.532 --> 00:53:23.995
<i>♪ Well. since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head ♪</i>

890
00:53:23.995 --> 00:53:25.747
<i>What's the matter?</i>
- <i>We doing a sing-along?</i>

891
00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:26.831
<i>I don't know.</i>

892
00:53:27.749 --> 00:53:30.752
We went into the studio
to record "Help Me. Rhonda" vocals.

893
00:53:31.878 --> 00:53:34.005
Well. I was having trouble with--
with this one part.

894
00:53:34.005 --> 00:53:36.883
- <i>♪ Well. Rhonda. you look so fine ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

895
00:53:36.883 --> 00:53:38.593
- <i>♪ Look so fine ♪</i>
<i>♪ And I know I-- ♪</i>

896
00:53:38.593 --> 00:53:40.637
<i>Hey. Al.
You missed the synco pretty bad.</i>

897
00:53:40.637 --> 00:53:42.347
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Do it one more time.</i>

898
00:53:42.347 --> 00:53:43.723
<i>You've got it. Okay.</i>

899
00:53:43.723 --> 00:53:45.684
<i>Now loosen up and be happy.</i>

900
00:53:45.684 --> 00:53:49.312
Murry came in
and wanted to produce the band...

901
00:53:49.312 --> 00:53:50.397
<i>♪ Since you put me down ♪</i>

902
00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:51.898
...and. uh. it got real uncomfortable.

903
00:53:51.898 --> 00:53:53.692
<i>♪ Since you put me down. baby ♪</i>

904
00:53:56.152 --> 00:53:57.529
- <i>Got it?</i>
<i>I got it. Murry.</i>

905
00:53:57.529 --> 00:53:59.447
<i>You're laughing.
but you know what I mean.</i>

906
00:53:59.447 --> 00:54:01.157
<i>Syncopate it a little.</i>

907
00:54:01.157 --> 00:54:02.826
He was drunk. you know?

908
00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:05.620
And Brian was masterful
in the studio. okay?

909
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.789
<i>Give him the track. Chuck.</i>

910
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:09.582
<i>Don't sing with it.
Let him sing it once.</i>

911
00:54:09.582 --> 00:54:10.917
<i>You want me to leave. Brian?</i>

912
00:54:10.917 --> 00:54:12.544
<i>No. I just want you
to let him sing it.</i>

913
00:54:12.544 --> 00:54:15.088
<i>Your mother and I can leave.</i>
<i>Did you really get drunk?</i>

914
00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:18.091
They were both trying
to produce me on the song.

915
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:20.593
And that's when they
kind of went to loggerheads.

916
00:54:21.219 --> 00:54:23.930
Trying to get me to--
So I kind of feel responsible in a way.

917
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.640
but what the hell. I don't know.

918
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.309
<i>Chuck. turn it down.</i>
<i>I'm a genius too.</i>

919
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:29.686
<i>Let's go. huh?</i>

920
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:32.856
<i>Turn down his playback.</i>

921
00:54:32.856 --> 00:54:34.691
Murry was jealous of Brian.

922
00:54:35.525 --> 00:54:37.402
{\an8}I didn't realize that for a while.

923
00:54:37.402 --> 00:54:40.488
{\an8}And when I did. I thought--
I was kind of shocked.

924
00:54:41.072 --> 00:54:44.826
<i>Brian. Forget who you are.
will you? Let's go. Let's roll.</i>

925
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:46.619
<i>I'm just thinking about
who you are.</i>

926
00:54:47.454 --> 00:54:52.334
Murry had such a great desire
to be a songwriter and to be recognized.

927
00:54:52.334 --> 00:54:54.502
<i>Can we run it?</i>
<i>You guys get too much money.</i>

928
00:54:54.502 --> 00:54:57.672
<i>you start thinking
you're gonna make everything a hit.</i>

929
00:54:57.672 --> 00:54:59.090
- <i>Brian--</i>
<i>Let me ask you this.</i>

930
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:00.842
- <i>Uh...</i>
<i>Come on now.</i>

931
00:55:00.842 --> 00:55:03.345
<i>I don't wanna start...
I just wanna make sure this is on tape.</i>

932
00:55:03.345 --> 00:55:05.680
<i>No. I'll never help you guys
mix another song.</i>

933
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.058
<i>Why?</i>
<i>When you guys get so big</i>

934
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:10.852
<i>that you can't sing from your hearts.
you're going downhill.</i>

935
00:55:10.852 --> 00:55:13.021
<i>Downhill?</i>
<i>Downhill!</i>

936
00:55:13.021 --> 00:55:15.523
- <i>Son. Son. I'm sorry.</i>

937
00:55:15.523 --> 00:55:18.109
<i>I've protected you for 22 years.
but I can't go on</i>

938
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:20.445
<i>if you're not gonna listen
to an intelligent man.</i>

939
00:55:21.654 --> 00:55:22.822
<i>Are you going now?</i>

940
00:55:22.822 --> 00:55:25.158
<i>If you wanna fight for success.
I'll go all out.</i>

941
00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:27.369
<i>No. I don't--
We don't want to do that.</i>

942
00:55:27.369 --> 00:55:29.746
<i>You think you got it made?</i>
<i>No. we don't.</i>

943
00:55:29.746 --> 00:55:31.915
<i>Chuck and I used to make
one hit after another...</i>

944
00:55:31.915 --> 00:55:35.126
<i>...in 30 minutes.
You guys take five hours to do it.</i>

945
00:55:35.126 --> 00:55:36.920
<i>Times are changing.</i>
<i>You know why?</i>

946
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.172
- <i>Because you think you have an image.</i>
<i>Times are changing.</i>

947
00:55:39.172 --> 00:55:40.924
<i>Don't ever forget.</i>

948
00:55:40.924 --> 00:55:42.550
<i>Times are changing.</i>

949
00:55:51.226 --> 00:55:54.979
We have learned
at a terrible and brutal cost

950
00:55:54.979 --> 00:55:57.899
that weakness does not bring peace.

951
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.821
And it is this lesson
that has brought us to Vietnam.

952

<i>♪ Baby. please don't go down

<i>♪ You know I love you so ♪</i>

954
00:56:07.492 --> 00:56:11.121
The culture was changing
in all kinds of ways.

955
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:14.165
<i>The psychedelic experience

956
00:56:14.165 --> 00:56:18.420

<i>♪ Baby. please don't go ♪</i>

permanently alter the brain's function.

960
00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:27.095
<i>Liftoff.</i>

961
00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:28.805

964
00:56:35.395 --> 00:56:38.815
The mid-'60s
was an incredibly rich time musically.

965
00:56:39.816 --> 00:56:41.317
Just really opened up.

966
00:56:41.943 --> 00:56:44.529
Also the awakening of consciousness.

967
00:56:44.529 --> 00:56:49.200
Society not wanting to let the status quo
go on just because it's the status quo.

<i>♪ Baby. please don't go ♪</i>

<i>♪ Baby. please don't go ♪</i>

970
00:56:57.042 --> 00:56:59.169
We were on tour
and got back home.

971
00:56:59.169 --> 00:57:03.381
{\an8}We started getting indications
that Brian was taking some hallucinogens.

972
00:57:03.381 --> 00:57:07.093
LSD and stuff like that. which a lot of
the writers were doing at the time.

973
00:57:08.303 --> 00:57:11.056
He drove me around the parking lot
about 20 times.

974
00:57:12.015 --> 00:57:14.476
Explaining about this great trip
he'd just taken. you know?

975
00:57:16.644 --> 00:57:20.023
Oh. yeah. I did LSD.
and it just totally tore my head off.

976
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:24.027
You just come to grips with what you are
and what you can do and what you can't do.

977
00:57:24.027 --> 00:57:26.488
And you learn to face it.
you know?

978
00:57:28.239 --> 00:57:30.658
Pretty soon.
the music was changing. Evolving.

979
00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:33.995
<i>Here we go.
This is real good now. Take 43.</i>

980
00:57:40.335 --> 00:57:43.672
Brian was hearing
these arrangements in his head.

981
00:57:43.672 --> 00:57:45.507
Who knows where they come from?

982
00:57:45.507 --> 00:57:48.510
Who knows where any arranger hears?

983
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:52.472
But most arrangers are guys
who have studied. studied. studied.

984
00:57:52.472 --> 00:57:54.641
They know just how to put 'em on a score.

985
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:57.977
Brian used to explain it to us.

986
00:57:57.977 --> 00:58:03.358
<i>Here's the whole secret of this
whole thing is if we can go...</i>

987
00:58:03.358 --> 00:58:05.276
<i>If we can have that emphasis there. okay?</i>

988
00:58:05.276 --> 00:58:10.198
It was a matter of us tuning in to what
he was saying and playing what he wanted.

989
00:58:10.907 --> 00:58:13.243
We felt
a little bit more at home with Brian.

990
00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:15.120
He knew that we were jazz players.

991
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:20.458
And took after Phil Spector. in the sense
that he'd use the three or the four hours.

992
00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.919
And he'd do. like. one whole tune.

993
00:58:22.919 --> 00:58:24.504
Whereas on the other record days.

994
00:58:24.504 --> 00:58:26.965
we would do three or four tunes
in the same time.

995
00:58:28.258 --> 00:58:32.887
The big difference between Phil and Brian
was Brian was still inventing.

996
00:58:32.887 --> 00:58:35.181
He was constantly rewriting himself.

997
00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:38.184
He knew where it was going. but we didn't.

998
00:58:38.184 --> 00:58:42.397
And if you're a creative person.
he'd let you have that freedom to create.

999
00:58:42.397 --> 00:58:43.898
and he knew how to use it.

1000
00:58:43.898 --> 00:58:45.900
It's great talent to be able to do that.

1001
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.486
<i>Sorry. but that drags.
I hate to say it. really.</i>

1002
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:50.196
<i>That-- That drags. Carol.</i>

1003
00:58:50.196 --> 00:58:52.949
We appreciate your loyal support.
See you next week. I hope.

1004
00:58:52.949 --> 00:58:56.619
In the meantime. it's <i>Shindig!</i> finale time
with Glen Campbell. Right over there.

1005
00:58:56.619 --> 00:58:57.704
Thank you.

1006
00:58:57.704 --> 00:59:00.749
By that time.
Glen Campbell has his own hit records.

1007
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:03.043
He can't come out on tour anymore.

1008
00:59:03.043 --> 00:59:06.671
<i>♪ Dream. dream. baby ♪</i>

1009
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:09.382
{\an8}Mike called me up.
He said. "You're in the record business."

1010
00:59:09.883 --> 00:59:13.845
{\an8}"Who do you know that could come out
for the weekend to fill in for Glen?"

1011
00:59:13.845 --> 00:59:15.805
So. I called about ten people.

1012
00:59:15.805 --> 00:59:18.641
I called him back.
I said. "I can't find anybody.

1013
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:20.226
But. honest to God. there's still time.

1014
00:59:20.226 --> 00:59:23.104
I can go to the airport.
and I'll bring a keyboard.

1015
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:25.273
and I'll just fill in for the weekend."

1016
00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:27.317
And that's how it started.

1017
00:59:29.486 --> 00:59:31.321
One of my first memories of Bruce.

1018
00:59:31.321 --> 00:59:34.824
I went into his hotel room.
and he was learning the bass.

1019
00:59:34.824 --> 00:59:36.284
so he could play it onstage.

1020
00:59:36.284 --> 00:59:38.161
He'd only ever played keyboard.

1021
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.668
My dream was to make $250 a week.

1022
00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:46.002
I thought. "Wow."

1023
00:59:46.002 --> 00:59:48.797
And Carl calls me.
He said. "Could you come back out?"

1024
00:59:48.797 --> 00:59:50.382
So I came out for two weeks.

1025
00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:54.344
Carl says. "We can cut you a check.
What do you want?"

1026
00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:57.097
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1027
00:59:57.097 --> 01:00:01.226
And so I get a check for $3.000.
'cause he thought I was asking per night.

1028
01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:02.310
I said. "Okay."

1029
01:00:02.894 --> 01:00:05.939
So.
that's how I got into the band.

1030
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.320
{\an8}My best friend was Terry Melcher.

1031
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.115
{\an8}And so Terry calls me up. and he said.

1032
01:00:15.115 --> 01:00:18.743
{\an8}"My mom. Doris Day.
she's got the best stereo system."

1033
01:00:18.743 --> 01:00:21.663
{\an8}So we go over.
and there's John and Michelle Phillips.

1034
01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:24.791
Mike Love. Brian Wilson. me.
Doris. Terry Melcher.

1035
01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:27.252
And we listened to <i>Rubber Soul</i>.

1036
01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:32.173
Now. that was a turning point
in The Beatles' world.

1037
01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:34.300
It was also a turning point for Brian.

1038
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.636
<i>♪ I'm looking through you ♪</i>

1039
01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:39.139
<i>♪ Where did you go? ♪</i>

1040
01:00:39.139 --> 01:00:40.682
When I first heard that.
I flipped.

1041
01:00:40.682 --> 01:00:42.767
I said.
"I want to make an album like that."

1042
01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:46.021
Where all the songs seem to be
like a collection of folk songs. you know?

1043
01:00:47.313 --> 01:00:49.816
He saw <i>Rubber Soul</i>
as a thematic album.

1044
01:00:49.816 --> 01:00:52.110
A little light went on.
and he started dreaming up.

1045
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.363
Conceptual album. Front to back. Thematic.

1046
01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:00.618
They're competing
against The Beatles.

1047
01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:03.288
but these guys are still wearing
striped shirts?

1048
01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:05.415
<i>♪ I wish they all could be... ♪</i>

1049
01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:08.918
I think Brian saw the need
to grow out of that identity.

1050
01:01:10.003 --> 01:01:15.759
Not to be defined by the external labels.
which had been now placed on the band.

1051
01:01:20.013 --> 01:01:23.933
This is what you did last
time. and we want you to do that again.

1052
01:01:23.933 --> 01:01:27.020
I can hardly wait to get out there
and hang ten.

1053
01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:31.316
Hey. maybe you guys
would like to join our club.

1054
01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:33.818
Your surfing club. huh?
That sounds real cool.

1055
01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:35.737
Evolution is
absolutely necessary.

1056
01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:38.740
{\an8}but you have a hit
with a certain style of song.

1057
01:01:39.282 --> 01:01:42.118
{\an8}And you will have guys in the band
who will just be like.

1058
01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:45.372
"Guys. this is well-tread territory.
We know it works.

1059
01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.123
Let's do another one like this."

1060
01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:51.586
<i>♪ We wish they all could be
California Girls ♪</i>

1061
01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:53.129
A lot of artists.

1062
01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:55.632
when they have they have to make
these kind of choices.

1063
01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:58.468
don't often make the choice for art.

1064
01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:05.934
Al Jardine had this great idea
for The Beach Boys

1065
01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:09.938
to record a version of this
folk song called "Sloop John B."

1066
01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:13.441
<i>♪ We come on the sloop John B ♪</i>

1067
01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:16.903
<i>♪ My grandfather and me ♪</i>

1068
01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:20.115
It was recorded
by The Kingston Trio.

1069
01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:23.034
{\an8}Basically a template
from my own musical upbringing.

1070
01:02:23.868 --> 01:02:25.704
I was in a folk group in high school.

1071
01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:29.332
We replicated The Kingston Trio
note-for-note.

1072
01:02:29.332 --> 01:02:32.085
But when The Beach Boys formed.
I left my folk group behind.

1073
01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.170
I feel kinda guilty about it.
to be honest with you.

1074
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.882
Anyway. I played Brian a song
called "Sloop John B."

1075
01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:39.926
<i>♪ Hoist up the John B's sail ♪</i>

1076
01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:42.387
Growing up.
he didn't like folk music really.

1077
01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:44.639
He was more music-driven
than story-driven.

1078
01:02:44.639 --> 01:02:47.559
<i>♪ Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home ♪</i>

1079
01:02:47.559 --> 01:02:49.060
But we sat down at the piano.

1080
01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:52.480
and I suggested we add a few chords
to give it that Beach Boy influence.

1081
01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:56.234
And he liked it. It fit our vocal style.

1082
01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:02.032
And then Brian went into the studio when
we were away touring to finish the song.

1083
01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:07.078
I remember being in Japan.
and Brian sent a mix of "Sloop John B."

1084
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:11.875
- <i>♪ Hoist up the John B's sail ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Hoist up the John B's ♪</i>

1085
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:15.337
- <i>♪ See how the mainsail sets ♪</i>
- <i>♪ See how the mainsail ♪</i>

1086
01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:18.214
<i>♪ Call for the captain ashore ♪</i>

1087
01:03:18.214 --> 01:03:21.718
<i>♪ Let me go home ♪</i>

1088
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:26.097
- <i>♪ I wanna go home ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Oh. let me go home ♪</i>

1089
01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:28.975
- <i>♪ Let me go ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Hoist up the John B's sail ♪</i>

1090
01:03:28.975 --> 01:03:30.685
<i>♪ Hoist up the John B's ♪</i>

1091
01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:33.021
<i>♪ I feel so broke up ♪</i>

1092
01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:35.899
<i>♪ I wanna go home ♪</i>

1093
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.901
He produced a masterpiece.

1094
01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.403
If I'd produced it.
it would still be a folk song.

1095
01:03:40.403 --> 01:03:41.905
But now-- now it's a classic.

1096
01:03:44.282 --> 01:03:46.201
Brian was really growing

1097
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:50.622
way beyond the three-.
four-chord format of doing pop tunes.

1098
01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:52.123
It just wasn't gonna do.

1099
01:03:52.707 --> 01:03:54.167
<i>♪ Let me go home ♪</i>

1100
01:03:54.167 --> 01:03:55.919
All of a sudden.

1101
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.630
{\an8}I began to realize
that I had a lot of music to make.

1102
01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:09.182
<i>Here we go.
"Wouldn't It Be Nice." Take one.</i>

1103
01:04:12.435 --> 01:04:15.814
I wanted to write some songs
that reflected how I really felt.

1104
01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:20.235
rather than just car songs. surf songs.
something more introspective.

1105
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:23.488
So I said. "Mike.
I'm writing with another collaborator."

1106
01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:26.074
And he goes. "What?
But I thought I was your collaborator."

1107
01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:29.327
I said. "Well. for this one album.
Tony Asher is my collaborator."

1108
01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:33.540
I was so overwhelmed
by what Brian was playing

1109
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.291
and coming up with and singing.

1110
01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:37.752
{\an8}I didn't think that much about the fact

1111
01:04:37.752 --> 01:04:41.798
{\an8}that lyrics were quite different than
the majority of the songs they'd done.

1112
01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:47.012
<i>♪ I keep lookin' for a place to fit in ♪</i>

1113
01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:51.850
<i>♪ where I can speak my mind ♪</i>

1114
01:04:54.185 --> 01:04:56.479
I knew there were lots of things
that he heard in his head

1115
01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:57.856
that I had no idea of.

1116
01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:00.275
<i>"I Just Wasn't Made
For These Times." Take one.</i>

1117
01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:05.530
That's when we started realizing
there's some genius here.

1118
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:10.285
<i>You got one. two. three-- boom.
No. It's one. two. three... boop!</i>

1119
01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:12.704
They kept getting better
and better and better.

1120
01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:14.539
<i>Take two. "Let Go of Your Ego."</i>

1121
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:19.544
I think not being schooled. like he was.
was a great thing.

1122
01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:21.629
You know.
because he didn't know the limits.

1123
01:05:21.629 --> 01:05:23.965
He didn't know
he was not supposed to do things.

1124
01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:28.553
<i>Let's make it real tight. okay?</i>

1125
01:05:28.553 --> 01:05:31.222
Phil Spector records.
marvels that they are.

1126
01:05:31.222 --> 01:05:33.850
they're kinda--
They're still like in black and white.

1127
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:39.939
{\an8}Brian got the same guys
but wrote songs and arrangements

1128
01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:41.941
that put the thing in Technicolor.

1129
01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:44.778
<i>Nice.</i>

1130
01:05:45.695 --> 01:05:47.072
We were still in Japan

1131
01:05:47.072 --> 01:05:50.742
while he was recording a lot of the tracks
for <i>Pet Sounds</i>.

1132
01:05:51.868 --> 01:05:55.455
Then when they got back. the
tracks were ready for 'em. ready to go.

1133
01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:58.375
All they had to do was go
and learn their parts. sing.

1134
01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:01.127
A lot of the lyrics were strange.

1135
01:06:01.127 --> 01:06:03.380
Especially to Mike.
who's more sensitive to lyrics.

1136
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.923
<i>Here we go. Take 11.</i>

1137
01:06:04.923 --> 01:06:06.341
<i>Take 19. please.</i>

1138
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.134
<i>Okay. Take 27. please.</i>

1139
01:06:08.677 --> 01:06:13.765
Brian had an obsession
with getting things absolutely perfect.

1140
01:06:14.432 --> 01:06:15.850
Like on "Wouldn't It Be Nice."

1141
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.728
we must have done the backgrounds
30 times.

1142
01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:23.692
<i>♪ You know it's gonna make it
that much better ♪</i>

1143
01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:29.906
<i>♪ When we can say good night
and stay together ♪</i>

1144
01:06:29.906 --> 01:06:33.993
I started calling him "dog ears."
because it was perfect vocally.

1145
01:06:33.993 --> 01:06:37.664
but Brian could hear something
that most human beings cannot.

1146
01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:41.584
<i>♪ And after having spent
the day together ♪</i>

1147
01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:45.380
You listen to the vocals
on <i>Pet Sounds</i>.

1148
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.382
they're some of the best ever recorded.

1149
01:06:47.382 --> 01:06:50.468
<i>♪ Happy times together
we'd be spending ♪</i>

1150
01:06:50.468 --> 01:06:57.308
<i>♪ I wish that every kiss
was never-ending ♪</i>

1151
01:06:57.308 --> 01:07:00.228
<i>♪ Oh. wouldn't it be nice? ♪</i>

1152
01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:04.482
To us it was more than a record.

1153
01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:06.484
{\an8}It was a new place.

1154
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:10.321
It was popular music
coming to a new level.

1155
01:07:10.321 --> 01:07:16.286
<i>♪ Baby. then there wouldn't be
a single thing we couldn't do ♪</i>

1156
01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:20.540
- <i>♪ Oh. we could be married ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Oh. we could be married ♪</i>

1157
01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:24.586
- <i>♪ And then we'd be happy ♪</i>
- <i>♪ And then we'd be happy ♪</i>

1158
01:07:24.586 --> 01:07:27.672
<i>♪ Oh. wouldn't it be nice! ♪</i>

1159
01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:32.969
But when we played it
for Capitol Records.

1160
01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:35.138
and they said. "Geez. This is great. guys.

1161
01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:36.723
But couldn't you do something more like

1162
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:40.060
'Surfin' U.S.A.'
or 'California Girls' or 'I Get Around'?"

1163
01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:49.903
Capitol Records
didn't really understand.

1164
01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:55.575
they were concerned about selling
albums and having commercial success.

1165
01:07:56.576 --> 01:08:00.080
And. uh. we were growing up.

1166
01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:06.461
We'd allowed Capitol Records to do our PR
and public relations and stuff.

1167
01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:09.339
And they didn't know how to treat it.

1168
01:08:09.964 --> 01:08:14.969
So. we needed somebody who got the idea
of <i>Pet Sounds</i> being an evolution.

1169
01:08:17.555 --> 01:08:21.142
{\an8}Derek Taylor was brilliant.
He was The Beatles' publicist for a while.

1170
01:08:21.142 --> 01:08:24.562
Then he moved to America.
and he became our publicist.

1171
01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:30.610
Derek Taylor is the one that came up with
the "Brian Wilson is a genius" moniker.

1172
01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:33.697
If you look
in The Beach Boys' history.

1173
01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:37.534
there is that constant struggle
between Brian and everybody else.

1174
01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:43.039
And. I think. perhaps the genius label.
in a way. gets linked to him

1175
01:08:43.748 --> 01:08:46.835
in part
because of his psychological struggles.

1176
01:08:50.255 --> 01:08:51.589
The solitude of Brian.

1177
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:53.466
The loneliness of Brian.

1178
01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:59.639
I think that's gone a long way
to fleshing out his musical genius

1179
01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.474
as part of a larger sense of.

1180
01:09:01.474 --> 01:09:06.396
"Well. he's a lone-- a lone figure
separate from the group."

1181
01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:08.815
And that's not fair to them.

1182
01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:13.486
I'm president
of the Brian Wilson fan club.

1183
01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:17.907
But the musicality of every Beach Boy
is essential.

1184
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:24.039
If we didn't have the ability. we wouldn't
have been able to sing these parts.

1185
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:31.671
Brian was lucky to have our voices
to sing his dreams.

1186
01:09:36.134 --> 01:09:39.721
When we were done with the album.
I'm talking to Derek Taylor.

1187
01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:43.224
and he said. "Why don't you come
to England to promote <i>Pet Sounds</i>?"

1188
01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:45.727
I said. "But it's not out there."

1189
01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:47.062
"Bring it anyway."

1190
01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:49.856
There's a guy who was getting famous

1191
01:09:49.856 --> 01:09:52.692
and dying to become one of The Beach Boys.
Keith Moon.

1192
01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.737
So he shows up at my suite.

1193
01:09:57.072 --> 01:09:59.532
{\an8}He says.
"I'm gonna guide you through England.

1194
01:09:59.532 --> 01:10:01.451
and you're going to meet everybody."

1195
01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:03.745
And I probably did 20 interviews.

1196
01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:05.914
I was a hero.

1197
01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:08.625
"Hey. I've got the new Beach Boys' album.
It's <i>Pet Sounds</i>."

1198
01:10:10.418 --> 01:10:13.505
And then. at the end of the week.
I come back to the hotel.

1199
01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:15.840
"Hey. man.
You better get up to the suite."

1200
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.092
"Why?"

1201
01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:20.679
"Lennon and McCartney are waiting
for you. They wanna hear <i>Pet Sounds</i>."

1202
01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:23.807
"What? I-- I haven't been
in the band that long."

1203
01:10:26.017 --> 01:10:29.104
So. they're dressed in Edwardian suits.

1204
01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:31.356
And they play the album a couple of times.

1205
01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:35.110
I just thought. "Oh. dear me.
This is the album of all time.

1206
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.028
{\an8}What the hell are we gonna do?"

1207
01:10:37.028 --> 01:10:39.864
Just 'cause the musical invention
on that is. like. wow.

1208
01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.703
<i>♪ I may not always love you ♪</i>

1209
01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:48.623
<i>♪ But long as there are stars above you ♪</i>

1210
01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:52.794
<i>♪ You never need to doubt it ♪</i>

1211
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:57.048
<i>♪ I'll make you so sure about it ♪</i>

1212
01:10:57.549 --> 01:11:00.552
When I first heard "God Only Knows."
I remember crying.

1213
01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:04.889
I remember tearing up
thinking about those lyrics.

1214
01:11:06.182 --> 01:11:09.436
<i>♪ If you should ever leave me ♪</i>

1215
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.440
<i>♪ Though life would still go on
Believe me ♪</i>

1216
01:11:14.065 --> 01:11:17.819
<i>♪ The world could show nothing to me ♪</i>

1217
01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:21.406
<i>♪ So what good would living do me? ♪</i>

1218
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:26.911
<i>♪ God only knows what I'd be without you ♪</i>

1219
01:11:28.496 --> 01:11:30.999
When we listen to something
like <i>Pet Sounds</i> now.

1220
01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:34.044
and the orchestration on that.
people go. "Yeah. cool."

1221
01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:36.629
{\an8}What they forget is. he did it first.

1222
01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:43.762
Brian put together textures that no one
had ever put into popular songs before.

1223
01:11:52.562 --> 01:11:56.149
<i>♪ God only knows
what I'd be without you ♪</i>

1224
01:11:56.149 --> 01:12:00.737
Brian made that decision
to thwart the listeners' expectations

1225
01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:04.574
for the sake of his art.
and it did not go unnoticed.

1226
01:12:05.492 --> 01:12:09.079
Paul McCartney said
"God Only Knows" is like the perfect song.

1227
01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:11.373
And then they got busy
on their next album.

1228
01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:17.337
I think it's more interesting
to think less of the competition.

1229
01:12:17.962 --> 01:12:20.131
and more of it as a collaboration.

1230
01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:26.805
{\an8}Together. that healthy collaboration
was advancing the music.

1231
01:12:26.805 --> 01:12:28.098
{\an8}It was advancing the culture.

1232
01:12:28.098 --> 01:12:31.518
{\an8}It was advancing
what rock music meant and could be.

1233
01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:35.814
And I always wondered.
if one of them didn't have the other.

1234
01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:38.942
would their music
actually be what it became?

1235
01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:45.198
But <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> was more
of a commercial success than <i>Pet Sounds</i>.

1236
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.494
{\an8}This is one of the great accomplishments
of The Beatles

1237
01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:52.914
{\an8}was they evolved
and thwarted over and over again.

1238
01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:55.750
But they did it gradually.

1239
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:59.421
They did it as a group
who all wanted the same thing.

1240
01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:03.591
But with <i>Pet Sounds</i>.
there was kind of a jump from here.

1241
01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:05.051
all of a sudden they're. you know.

1242
01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:07.929
something snapped. and you are over here.
unlike The Beatles.

1243
01:13:16.646 --> 01:13:19.107
<i>Pet Sounds</i> was so radical

1244
01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:22.277
{\an8}compared to the really
nice commercial albums

1245
01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:23.319
that we'd been making.

1246
01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:27.699
that Capitol had been so successful
in selling that they just wanted more.

1247
01:13:28.283 --> 01:13:31.619
So. instead of promoting <i>Pet Sounds</i>
here in America.

1248
01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:34.497
Capitol put out
the first <i>Best of The Beach Boys</i>

1249
01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:35.874
and promoted that.

1250
01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.417
And it went gold quickly.

1251
01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:41.504
{\an8}And they didn't promote <i>Pet Sounds</i> because
they said that it wasn't commercial.

1252
01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:43.089
{\an8}and the people wouldn't understand it.

1253
01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:49.429
They called us "the number one
surfing group in the USA."

1254
01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:51.765
it was completely ridiculous.

1255
01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:54.893
in light of the fact that there was things
like the Vietnam War.

1256
01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:58.563
and student demonstrations.
and the Civil Rights Movement.

1257
01:13:58.563 --> 01:14:02.150
and all these things that the youth
of society was completely caught up in.

1258
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:07.739
It certainly wasn't the idyllic culture
that we sang about in the early '60s.

1259
01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.374
He couldn't understand it.

1260
01:14:17.374 --> 01:14:21.795
The thing that he put his heart and soul
into more than any record he'd ever done.

1261
01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:25.340
and people didn't think it was that great.

1262
01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:31.930
<i>Pet Sounds</i> was not commercially
received as it was critically.

1263
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:33.765
and I think it hurt Brian.

1264
01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:37.644
I think he was at a very vulnerable stage
in his life.

1265
01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:44.109
My whole life depended
on the success of The Beach Boys.

1266
01:14:44.109 --> 01:14:46.528
and I'm very deeply affected
by what people think.

1267
01:14:48.613 --> 01:14:51.533
I said. "Look. I want to do something
that people will respect.

1268
01:14:51.533 --> 01:14:53.868
And not just industry people.
but the public."

1269
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:56.955
<i>Let me hear the organ.</i>

1270
01:14:58.748 --> 01:15:01.209
"Good Vibrations"
was very schizophrenic.

1271
01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:04.379
It was recorded in many different studios.
Uh. three to be exact.

1272
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:05.547
<i>Stop. please.</i>

1273
01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:10.176
I'd bet you it'd be a half million bucks
just for the track now. Just the track.

1274
01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:14.514
He really was going after
what he was going after.

1275
01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:18.351
I mean. who in their right mind
ever thought of putting a theremin

1276
01:15:19.185 --> 01:15:21.688
on a-- on a pop record?

1277
01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.985
Let's go from the top.
You got that. Okay.

1278
01:15:26.985 --> 01:15:29.029
All right. This will be take 25.

1279
01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.824
"Good Vibrations."
We were in for three months.

1280
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.451
Nobody does that.

1281
01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:37.829
A lot of guys would say.
"He's out of his mind."

1282
01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:38.913
I never said that.

1283
01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:41.666
I always respected
the genius of Brian Wilson.

1284
01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:47.630
Eventually. Brian made it studio worthy
for us to sing on.

1285
01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:51.885
But Mike's driving to the session.
but he hasn't written the words.

1286
01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:54.846
So his wife. Suzanne.
in the passenger seat.

1287
01:15:54.846 --> 01:15:58.600
Mike's driving. dictating words to her
as he goes to the studio.

1288
01:15:59.809 --> 01:16:03.021
<i>♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪</i>

<i>♪ Close my eyes ♪</i>

1297
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.380
It only took us
two nights to sing.

1298
01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.049
It took Brian several months
to put it together.

1299
01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:35.595
He spent a lot of time on that.
and I couldn't figure out why. you know?

1300
01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:37.681
But that was Brian.

1301
01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:43.186
<i>♪ When I look in her eyes ♪</i>

1302
01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:47.899
When I heard the thing. I said.
"Whoa! That's it. man.

1303
01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.150
That's the monster hit."

1304
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:50.568
And it was the monster hit.

1305
01:16:50.568 --> 01:16:53.697
{\an8}<i>♪ I'm picking up good vibrations ♪</i>

1306
01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:56.825
<i>♪ She's giving me excitations ♪</i>

1307
01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:58.076
Once again.

1308
01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:02.706
our writing relationship proved out
to be extremely successful.

1309
01:17:06.584 --> 01:17:10.463
The problem was.
Brian was being hailed as a genius.

1310
01:17:10.463 --> 01:17:13.133
but there was no credit
for the rest of the band.

1311
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.552
or Mike Love for writing songs.

1312
01:17:16.594 --> 01:17:21.725
It would've been nice
had that reality been put forward.

1313
01:17:21.725 --> 01:17:26.771
It might have been a little bit easier
for Brian to handle the "genius" label.

1314
01:17:34.696 --> 01:17:37.532
In 1966. we were on tour.

1315
01:17:38.199 --> 01:17:41.369
And even though
<i>Pet Sounds</i> didn't do that well in the US.

1316
01:17:42.162 --> 01:17:44.497
England really came through for us.

1317
01:17:45.832 --> 01:17:49.836
We were voted the number one group.
Number two being The Beatles.

1318
01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:57.677
They just loved us.

1319
01:17:57.677 --> 01:18:00.472
and "Good Vibrations" broke in
at number one over there.

1320
01:18:00.472 --> 01:18:03.475
So there was this pressure
to deliver something great

1321
01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:06.061
with the next album. <i>Smile</i>.

1322
01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:14.986
We were busy touring and stuff.
so I wasn't writing with him at that time.

1323
01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:17.864
It was Van Dyke Parks.

1324
01:18:18.448 --> 01:18:20.700
Twenty-one. Take 250. Marker.

1325
01:18:21.826 --> 01:18:23.161
All music passes with me

1326
01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:27.415
{\an8}but The Beach Boys. I like
because of their essential modesty.

1327
01:18:28.541 --> 01:18:30.210
So. I wrote some lyrics for Brian.

1328
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:32.587
and I think that that's been my best shot
in town yet.

1329
01:18:32.587 --> 01:18:36.466
<i>♪ Well you're well
You're welcome ♪</i>

1330
01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:39.594
I met him on the lawn
of Terry Melcher's house.

1331
01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:43.598
I thought. "Wow. That guy has
a great style of talking." You know?

1332
01:18:43.598 --> 01:18:46.726
{\an8}And I said. "Hey. Would you like
to write some lyrics with me?"

1333
01:18:46.726 --> 01:18:48.687
He goes. "Sure. I'll give it a try."

1334
01:18:50.605 --> 01:18:53.942
Those were the days
of considerable drug abuse.

1335
01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:58.321
<i>♪ Well you're well
You're welcome ♪</i>

1336
01:18:58.321 --> 01:19:00.907
I was into
taking a lot of stimulant pills.

1337
01:19:00.907 --> 01:19:03.535
{\an8}'cause I didn't think I had any energy
of my own. you know?

1338
01:19:03.535 --> 01:19:06.246
So I would take these pills.
and they would--

1339
01:19:06.246 --> 01:19:08.164
You know... [exclaims] ...there it is.

1340
01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:09.207
I took the pill.

1341
01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.417
I feel great.

1342
01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:14.713
And Van Dyke Parks and I used to take
uppers and write songs together.

1343
01:19:14.713 --> 01:19:16.339
We'd write our heads off.

1344
01:19:18.091 --> 01:19:19.759
This was way ahead of our time.

1345
01:19:19.759 --> 01:19:23.013
This was the most advanced
musical experimentation

1346
01:19:23.013 --> 01:19:24.806
in the popular music industry.

1347
01:19:24.806 --> 01:19:30.562
<i>♪ Well. you're welcome to come ♪</i>

1348
01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:41.865
He started
to get into deep water then.

1349
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:46.244
I should say he started
to get into difficulty inside of himself.

1350
01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:48.413
and. yet. the music was fantastic.

1351
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.500
I was getting pretty far out
by that time.

1352
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.544
{\an8}I had the musicians wearing fire helmets.

1353
01:19:54.544 --> 01:19:56.838
I had a guy bring in a bucket
with burning wood

1354
01:19:56.838 --> 01:19:58.882
to smell of smoke in the studio.

1355
01:19:58.882 --> 01:20:00.050
I mean. I was crazy.

1356
01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:04.429
It so happens that a building burned down

1357
01:20:04.429 --> 01:20:06.848
the same day
we were doing that down the street.

1358
01:20:07.932 --> 01:20:11.102
I began to think that we started that fire
somehow mystically.

1359
01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:14.689
I had a lot of money. of course.
I'm a millionaire.

1360
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:18.026
And I was able
to get ahold of all these drugs. you know?

1361
01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:20.487
And they fucked--

1362
01:20:20.487 --> 01:20:23.490
I was able to get ahold
of all these drugs and they messed me up.

1363
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.493
They. uh-- They messed my mind up.

1364
01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:31.956
He was pretty paranoid
and ultra sensitive.

1365
01:20:32.499 --> 01:20:35.960
But I was there as one of the troops
to go in and do backgrounds.

1366
01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.630
I sang on many of those songs.

1367
01:20:42.717 --> 01:20:45.220
It's been said
that Michael was not supportive.

1368
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:49.057
And there were certain things
that he was not supportive of.

1369
01:20:49.724 --> 01:20:51.726
The heavy drug taking

1370
01:20:51.726 --> 01:20:55.730
and the acid alliteration.
I used to call it. of Van Dyke Parks.

1371
01:20:56.773 --> 01:20:58.858
I wasn't close enough
to the other guys.

1372
01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:01.403
I was in a position
of defending my lyrics.

1373
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.365
Mike Love said to me one day--
He said. "Explain this.

1374
01:21:05.907 --> 01:21:09.202
'Over and over.
the crow cries. "Uncover the cornfield."'

1375
01:21:09.202 --> 01:21:11.538
"Van Dyke. what does that lyric mean?"

1376
01:21:11.538 --> 01:21:13.623
He says. "I don't know. I haven't a clue."

1377
01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:14.791
I said. "Exactly."

1378
01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:18.461
He thought
the lyrics were not relatable.

1379
01:21:19.295 --> 01:21:20.672
Personally. I loved it.

1380
01:21:20.672 --> 01:21:23.258
So artistic and abstract.

1381
01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:26.678
<i>♪ Hung velvet overtaken me ♪</i>

1382
01:21:26.678 --> 01:21:29.597
<i>♪ Dim chandelier awaken me ♪</i>

1383
01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:34.561
<i>♪ To a song dissolved in the dawn ♪</i>

1384
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:38.815
I realized that Brian and Van Dyke
were expressing a new poetry.

1385
01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:44.612
But it could be that it was not
an appropriate project for The Beach Boys.

1386
01:21:44.612 --> 01:21:48.033
Maybe that would have been most fitting
as Brian's album.

1387
01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:55.123
<i>♪ Columnated ruins domino ♪</i>

1388
01:21:57.167 --> 01:22:01.254
I wanted to do my kind of music.
and they wanted to do their kind of music.

1389
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.631
So. it was a tug-of-war.

1390
01:22:04.466 --> 01:22:06.384
I felt like I was getting pulled
to pieces.

1391
01:22:06.885 --> 01:22:08.053
<i>♪ Surf's up ♪</i>

1392
01:22:12.015 --> 01:22:15.769
<i>♪ Aboard a tidal wave ♪</i>

1393
01:22:16.603 --> 01:22:19.356
Very chaotic.
very turbulent time for him.

1394
01:22:20.857 --> 01:22:23.860
and he was just not able to finish
<i>the Smile</i> project.

1395
01:22:25.695 --> 01:22:28.698
He took <i>the Smile</i> tapes
and shelved them.

1396
01:22:30.992 --> 01:22:32.744
It was too much for him to finish.

1397
01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:35.246
He just put it away.

1398
01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:46.758
It was. primarily. he had this fear.
I think. that the music would be rejected.

1399
01:22:48.009 --> 01:22:50.553
I thought that it was inappropriate music
for us to make.

1400
01:22:50.553 --> 01:22:52.931
Inappropriate for you.
Brian Wilson. or for The Beach Boys?

1401
01:22:52.931 --> 01:22:54.474
For The Beach Boys. yeah.

1402
01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:56.101
What was inappropriate
about it?

1403
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:59.020
Well. it was just the ideas
behind the songs were too weird.

1404
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.356
It was like fire and elements and.
you know?

1405
01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:03.024
I just threw it away. I junked it.

1406
01:23:06.277 --> 01:23:07.946
We were pretty exhausted by then.

1407
01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:11.282
And so. we decided to build a studio
inside Brian's home.

1408
01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:14.119
And we were able
to come back together socially.

1409
01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:16.538
and actually enjoy doing
what we were doing again.

1410
01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.915
It's almost like starting over.

1411
01:23:19.624 --> 01:23:22.544
And so we made this little album
called <i>Smiley Smile</i>.

1412
01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:25.588
<i>♪ I'm gonna be around my vegetables ♪</i>

1413
01:23:25.588 --> 01:23:27.382
<i>♪ I'm gonna chow down my vegetables ♪</i>

1414
01:23:27.382 --> 01:23:29.342
There's crazy stuff
on that album.

1415
01:23:29.342 --> 01:23:32.095
We had a song
about your favorite vegetable.

1416
01:23:32.929 --> 01:23:34.389
I know it sounds crazy.

1417
01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:36.266
<i>♪ My favorite vegetable ♪</i>

1418
01:23:38.018 --> 01:23:41.730
<i>Smiley Smile</i> shows a lot
of psychological cracking.

1419
01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.523
and strangeness and oddballness.

1420
01:23:43.523 --> 01:23:46.067
That's when I was like.
"Whoa! This is quite different."

1421
01:23:46.067 --> 01:23:49.195
For someone who's hungry
for experimental sounds.

1422
01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:51.698
or unpredictable musical experiences.

1423
01:23:51.698 --> 01:23:54.200
that whole album
is an unpredictable musical experience.

1424
01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.662
<i>♪ I'm gonna keep well. my vegetables ♪</i>

1425
01:23:57.662 --> 01:24:00.498
<i>♪ Cart off and sell my vegetables ♪</i>

1426
01:24:00.498 --> 01:24:04.461
Brian's innovation and obsession
with pushing the envelope musically

1427
01:24:04.461 --> 01:24:07.297
is what helped take them to another level.

1428
01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:11.968
But there is an inherent risk
when you take those big swings:

1429
01:24:11.968 --> 01:24:16.806
To swing and completely overshoot
your fan base because you went too far.

1430
01:24:24.898 --> 01:24:26.900
I created my head off.
I made a lot of records.

1431
01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.568
And sang my face off.

1432
01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:33.823
{\an8}I reached the point of exhaustion.
and. uh. I did retreat.

1433
01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:38.328
<i>♪ Your favorite vegetable ♪</i>

1434
01:24:41.581 --> 01:24:44.167
He was at this point
with The Beach Boys

1435
01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:48.755
where they weren't as happy
with the music he wanted to create.

1436
01:24:48.755 --> 01:24:52.175
You know. there was a lot
of squabbling going on all the time.

1437
01:24:52.175 --> 01:24:55.095
And Brian just said.
"You know what? Let them do it.

1438
01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:57.597
Let them do it.
Let them see how easy it is."

1439
01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:04.813
Even though
he was the mastermind.

1440
01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:08.066
he. suddenly.
did not have their full support.

1441
01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:14.656
And. I think. because it was his family.
it made that much more difficult

1442
01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:19.911
and. perhaps.
much more demanding on his psyche.

1443
01:25:21.162 --> 01:25:26.751
So many artists who have very.
very significant commercial success

1444
01:25:26.751 --> 01:25:30.505
forget why they got into the business
in the first place.

1445
01:25:30.505 --> 01:25:32.132
Why they do music.

1446
01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:38.096
And now. you are judging your validity
through commerce

1447
01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.473
more than anything else.

1448
01:25:44.894 --> 01:25:48.815
At that time
the Monterey Pop Festival was going on.

1449
01:25:49.733 --> 01:25:53.111
They were supposed to headline
Saturday night. but they dropped out.

1450
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.156
{\an8}I couldn't believe it.
Nobody could believe it.

1451
01:25:56.698 --> 01:25:58.199
This was such a turning point.

1452
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.076
Who knows what would've happened?

1453
01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:03.997

01:26:18.136 --> 01:26:22.807
You know. that was The Who.
Janis Joplin. along with Hendrix.

1459
01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:26.102
Jefferson Airplane.
and. of course. The Dead.

1460
01:26:32.317 --> 01:26:36.321
Psychedelia had kicked in and. all
of a sudden. it was a whole different era.

1461
01:26:44.245 --> 01:26:48.166
Monterey Pop was seen
as a culture-changing moment.

1462
01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:49.167
and they weren't there.

1463
01:26:50.877 --> 01:26:55.840
Because we were in such disarray.
we missed that train. so to speak.

1464
01:27:00.887 --> 01:27:02.389
They weren't with the times.

1465
01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:05.183
and they weren't pushing
to where things were going.

1466
01:27:06.017 --> 01:27:10.897
In the early '60s. they became
the poster boys for the California dream.

1467
01:27:10.897 --> 01:27:14.734
But at the end of the '60s.
that dream changed.

1468
01:27:14.734 --> 01:27:19.823
and they never made enough
of a public-facing shift

1469
01:27:19.823 --> 01:27:22.283
to change with the times.

1470
01:27:22.283 --> 01:27:24.744
<i>♪ Well. East Coast girls are hip ♪</i>

1471

<i>♪ They knock me out when I'm down there ♪</i>

1474
01:27:38.299 --> 01:27:42.929
At that time. you have some
of the most culturally-relevant music

1475
01:27:42.929 --> 01:27:44.055
in American History.

1476
01:27:44.597 --> 01:27:48.268
Songs about the struggle for civil rights.
around identity.

1477
01:27:48.268 --> 01:27:49.936
around political freedoms.

1478
01:27:49.936 --> 01:27:54.774
And their image was as far as you could be
from the changes in the culture.

1479
01:27:54.774 --> 01:27:59.279
<i>♪ I wish

<i>♪ I wish

1482
01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.293
And then there's Dennis.

1483
01:28:14.336 --> 01:28:17.047
Hi. My name is Dennis Wilson.

1484
01:28:17.589 --> 01:28:19.174
I make rock-and-roll records.

1485
01:28:23.011 --> 01:28:26.097
He became more of
a quintessential '60s LA rock guy.

1486
01:28:26.097 --> 01:28:30.894
<i>♪ Oh. hello. Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason ♪</i>

1487
01:28:30.894 --> 01:28:32.812
Dennis was part of the scene.

1488
01:28:32.812 --> 01:28:35.982
He was part of the Laurel Canyon world.

1489
01:28:35.982 --> 01:28:38.693
Part of the counter-cultural world
of the Sunset Strip.

1490
01:28:39.819 --> 01:28:41.488
He was just a wild person.

1491
01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:44.240
Interestingly enough. though.

1492
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.079
he is actually the one who got us
interested in things like meditation.

1493
01:28:49.704 --> 01:28:51.956
Even if he was drunk.
he'd say. "Let's meditate."

1494
01:28:56.002 --> 01:29:00.548
One afternoon. Dennis picked up a couple
of hitchhikers on Sunset Boulevard.

1495
01:29:01.091 --> 01:29:02.175
and he took them home.

1496
01:29:02.801 --> 01:29:07.263
{\an8}He told the girls he had a guru.
which was Maharishi.

1497
01:29:07.263 --> 01:29:09.849
{\an8}who had taught all of us how to meditate.

1498
01:29:10.684 --> 01:29:12.769
And then they said. "Well. we have a guru.

1499
01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:17.190
His name is Charlie Manson."

1500
01:29:20.151 --> 01:29:21.569
I only met the guy once.

1501
01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:23.905
and that was enough for me.

1502
01:29:26.282 --> 01:29:28.868
Manson was actually
an aspiring songwriter.

1503
01:29:29.494 --> 01:29:32.247
So. Dennis and Charlie
started to write together.

1504
01:29:33.123 --> 01:29:37.544
And at that time. The Beach Boys released
a Charles Manson song as a B-side.

1505
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:39.921
"Never Learn Not To Love."

1506
01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:43.591
There's lots of ways to talk about Manson.

1507
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:46.720
and one of them is that he's still part
of the California dream.

1508
01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.722
He wanted the dream.
He wanted the Hollywood dream.

1509
01:29:48.722 --> 01:29:49.889
He wanted to be a rock star.

1510
01:29:49.889 --> 01:29:53.143
He wanted to go through Dennis
to get to Terry Melcher.

1511
01:29:54.477 --> 01:29:57.897
Dennis introduced Manson
to Terry Melcher.

1512
01:29:59.232 --> 01:30:01.317
But he was turned down by Terry.

1513
01:30:01.317 --> 01:30:04.404
And what happened next. happened next.

1514
01:30:04.404 --> 01:30:06.906
<i>In a scene described
by one investigator</i>

1515
01:30:06.906 --> 01:30:08.950
{\an8}<i>as reminiscent of a weird religious rite.</i>

1516
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:12.829
{\an8}<i>five persons. including actress
Sharon Tate. were found dead.</i>

1517
01:30:13.621 --> 01:30:18.001
Manson went to Terry's house
that he used to rent. but Terry had moved.

1518
01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:21.379
That's where he had those people killed.

1519
01:30:22.088 --> 01:30:23.340
It was just awful.

1520
01:30:24.632 --> 01:30:27.302
And I think it weighed
upon Dennis pretty heavily.

1521
01:30:28.303 --> 01:30:32.807
because he had a hand
in introducing him to our world.

1522
01:30:35.518 --> 01:30:37.520
He's always felt bad about it
ever since.

1523
01:30:38.063 --> 01:30:39.314
It wasn't his fault.

1524
01:30:42.275 --> 01:30:46.946
We were in a rough patch.
and Murry must have thought it was over.

1525
01:30:48.573 --> 01:30:50.575
Murry was the publisher. remember?

1526
01:30:50.575 --> 01:30:52.994
He actually took over
the publishing catalog.

1527
01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:58.458
He. at one time. told us
he was gonna sell us back the publishing.

1528
01:30:58.458 --> 01:31:01.378
but he didn't.

1529
01:31:04.172 --> 01:31:08.176
Brian got a call.
and his father said. "I sold the catalog."

1530
01:31:09.219 --> 01:31:14.224
And Brian went. "You sold my songs?
How could you do that to me?"

1531
01:31:15.392 --> 01:31:17.894
Brian was real. real hurt.

1532
01:31:18.478 --> 01:31:20.063
It was very hard for him.

1533
01:31:21.606 --> 01:31:25.443
Murry just thought.
"The guys are gonna go so far for so long.

1534
01:31:25.443 --> 01:31:28.488
and then they're gonna die off.
just like all these other artists.

1535
01:31:28.488 --> 01:31:30.031
So I might as well cash in."

1536
01:31:33.535 --> 01:31:38.123
I wrote the words to many songs
Murry did not credit me on.

1537
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:42.043
So I got cheated by my uncle.

1538
01:31:42.544 --> 01:31:45.046
But my cousin was going
through mental issues.

1539
01:31:45.046 --> 01:31:47.632
and he had no control over his father.

1540
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:52.220
And. so... [stammers] What can you do?

1541
01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.682
Brian was a half owner with Murry.

1542
01:31:55.682 --> 01:31:58.476
And what are you gonna do?
Go sue your own father?

1543
01:31:58.476 --> 01:32:00.395
No. He wasn't gonna do that.

1544
01:32:01.187 --> 01:32:06.359
It really hurt him. and I don't think he
got out of bed for three days after that.

1545
01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:13.241
There were reflashes of LSD.

1546
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:16.411
It was said I'm insecure.
I can't face this. I can't do this.

1547
01:32:16.411 --> 01:32:17.912
I'm gonna hide in my bedroom.

1548
01:32:18.705 --> 01:32:20.790
You know. Brian. he was troubled.

1549
01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:25.920
The guys would all be there.
and he says. "I'm just gonna stay in bed."

1550
01:32:27.297 --> 01:32:30.300
While we were recording
at his home in Beverly Hills.

1551
01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:34.346
he was reluctant
to come down and participate.

1552
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.562
I would go to his house daily
and beg. "What can I do to help you?"

1553
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:44.564
For-- Forget recording.

1554
01:32:45.148 --> 01:32:48.318
I'd give up everything
just as long as my brother would be okay.

1555
01:32:50.278 --> 01:32:53.782
It was very painful at times
to see Brian go through that.

1556
01:32:54.991 --> 01:32:56.201
And it was at that point

1557
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:59.746
that Brian asked me
to become more involved in the production.

1558
01:33:02.874 --> 01:33:04.793
Carl was Brian's protégée really.

1559
01:33:06.044 --> 01:33:09.089
And after all those years
attending the Wrecking Crew sessions.

1560
01:33:09.798 --> 01:33:10.965
Carl was ready for it.

1561
01:33:10.965 --> 01:33:14.135
<i>Two. One. two. three. Go.</i>
And I. of course. had led the band

1562
01:33:14.135 --> 01:33:16.137
from when he stopped touring back in '64.

1563
01:33:16.137 --> 01:33:18.098
So. I think it was kind of natural.

When Brian stopped producing.

1569
01:33:34.989 --> 01:33:40.078
it opened the door to more
of a democratic process in the studio.

1570
01:33:40.662 --> 01:33:47.544
<i>♪ I can hear music ♪</i>

1571
01:33:48.294 --> 01:33:50.088

Bruce Johnston producing.
Al Jardine producing.

1573
01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:55.468
Of course.
I wrote many of those songs as well.

1578
01:34:11.943 --> 01:34:17.782
But. of all of us. Dennis's music
began to evolve really quite amazingly.

1579
01:34:21.828 --> 01:34:25.415
"Forever" was one of the great pieces
that Dennis created.

1580
01:34:26.082 --> 01:34:29.419
It just blew--
I mean. it just blew us away.

1581
01:34:30.712 --> 01:34:36.509

1585
01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:54.986
Dennis had all this hidden talent.

1586
01:34:55.653 --> 01:34:56.696
I used to watch him and go.

1587
01:34:56.696 --> 01:34:59.074
"God. I didn't know
he could play the piano like that."

1588
01:34:59.741 --> 01:35:00.784
He kinda hid that.

1589
01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:03.787
I think it was very hard for him
growing up.

1590
01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:07.707
He would be behind Brian
and try to match up to him musically.

1591
01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:11.419
But as Dennis got older.
he felt comfortable enough

1592
01:35:11.419 --> 01:35:14.631
to start bringing out. you know.
who he was musically.

1593
01:35:17.509 --> 01:35:22.347
<i>♪ I've been so happy loving you ♪</i>

1594
01:35:26.476 --> 01:35:29.729
You listen
to those late-'60s records and early-'70s.

1595
01:35:29.729 --> 01:35:31.272
they sound like a different band.

1596
01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.443
And I do think maybe that's part of why
they weren't as popular.

1597
01:35:35.443 --> 01:35:37.153
is people didn't know
what to do with them.

1598
01:35:37.153 --> 01:35:43.952
<i>♪ So hard to answer future's riddle
when ahead is seeming so far behind ♪</i>

1599
01:35:43.952 --> 01:35:47.872
The Beach Boys as a sound
was so cemented on those early records.

1600
01:35:48.415 --> 01:35:50.709
It's almost like boy bands or kid actors

1601
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:54.295
who can't shake
that first period of success.

1602
01:35:55.296 --> 01:35:56.798
It haunted them.

1603
01:35:56.798 --> 01:36:00.760
because your sense of self
starts circulating with that artifice.

1604
01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.806
<i>♪ But I hit hard at the battle
that's confronting me. yeah ♪</i>

1605
01:36:04.806 --> 01:36:07.684
My sense of their career
has always been.

1606
01:36:07.684 --> 01:36:11.771
"Well. we needed that to become
who we are. but who are we really?

1607
01:36:11.771 --> 01:36:13.231
Who are we as artists?"

1608
01:36:13.231 --> 01:36:15.400
And I don't think that struggle
ever left them.

1609
01:36:16.568 --> 01:36:19.571
<i>♪ Long promised road ♪</i>

1610
01:36:19.571 --> 01:36:21.906
We thought
the songs sounded great.

1611
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:24.159
The public didn't think so.

1612
01:36:24.159 --> 01:36:27.829
We were down like $5.000 a night
for a gig. Can you believe that?

1613
01:36:28.538 --> 01:36:29.998
We were just slugging it out.

1614
01:36:29.998 --> 01:36:32.375

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:35.628
<i>♪ Long promised road ♪</i>

1616
01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:37.964
We were no longer Beach Boys.

1617
01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:39.841
We were beach men.

1618
01:36:40.425 --> 01:36:42.218
In fact. we even tried to change the name.

1619
01:36:42.218 --> 01:36:44.429
I said. "Let's call ourselves 'Beach.'"

1620
01:36:47.223 --> 01:36:49.642
That would never work.
but Al was right.

1621
01:36:50.393 --> 01:36:53.188
The Beach Boys became uncool to listen to.

1622
01:36:55.899 --> 01:36:58.401
We became determined
to reinvent ourselves.

1623
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:02.322
Let's get out
of this Beach Boys thing. you know?

1624
01:37:03.198 --> 01:37:06.409
<i>♪ Don't go near the water ♪</i>

1625
01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:09.746
<i>♪ Don't you think it's sad? ♪</i>

1626
01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.873
That album has "surf" in the title.

1627
01:37:11.873 --> 01:37:15.293
but <i>Surf's Up</i> is not about the surf
being up and everything's being good.

1628
01:37:15.293 --> 01:37:18.880
The first song on that record is.
"Don't Go Near the Water."

1629
01:37:19.381 --> 01:37:23.259
<i>♪ Oceans. rivers. lakes and streams ♪</i>

1630
01:37:23.259 --> 01:37:25.637
{\an8}<i>♪ Have all been touched by man ♪</i>

1631
01:37:25.637 --> 01:37:28.056
We felt like
we were doing serious music. you know?

1632
01:37:28.056 --> 01:37:31.267
But. uh. it didn't help sell
the album particularly.

1633
01:37:33.812 --> 01:37:35.647
So we decided we needed a new sound.

1634
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:40.151
In the past. Brian was the leader.
musically speaking.

1635
01:37:40.151 --> 01:37:43.571
But he didn't show up very much anymore
for the sessions.

1636
01:37:43.571 --> 01:37:47.909
In order to save the group.
sometimes things had to be done.

1637
01:37:47.909 --> 01:37:49.953
like more people getting involved.

1638
01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:56.710
Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin
were in a group called The Flames.

1639
01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:58.420
and we met them in London.

1640
01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:00.505
<i>♪ Here she comes ♪</i>

1641
01:38:01.798 --> 01:38:04.676
<i>♪ Breathing life into my thoughts ♪</i>

1642
01:38:04.676 --> 01:38:07.303
They had this idea
to have me and Blonds join the group.

1643
01:38:07.303 --> 01:38:09.597
{\an8}and I just thought
it was just so ridiculous.

1644
01:38:09.597 --> 01:38:10.974
It just didn't seem possible

1645
01:38:10.974 --> 01:38:14.102
because it seemed
like such a tight-knit family thing.

1646
01:38:14.102 --> 01:38:17.272
And when we first joined the group.
it was weird adjusting.

1647
01:38:18.314 --> 01:38:21.276
<i>♪ Wherever she goes
You know the devil dances ♪</i>

1648
01:38:21.276 --> 01:38:23.778
<i>♪ And the gods lay down in defeat ♪</i>

1649
01:38:23.778 --> 01:38:26.156
Being around them.
when we were working and stuff.

1650
01:38:26.156 --> 01:38:28.324
that was just a lovely experience.

1651
01:38:28.908 --> 01:38:31.536
{\an8}Of course. it wasn't as funky
as what we were used to.

1652
01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:34.414
{\an8}Well. in our way of funky.

1653
01:38:38.543 --> 01:38:42.339
When we got involved.
the music got a little harder.

1654
01:38:47.927 --> 01:38:52.640
For live. we pumped a whole lot more
than they used to.

1655
01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.602
And I'm not knocking you guys.
but whatever.

1656
01:38:55.602 --> 01:39:00.732
<i>♪ Mama. I'm tellin' you
as sure as I am standing here ♪</i>

1657
01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:03.985
<i>♪ She's my girl ♪</i>

1658
01:39:03.985 --> 01:39:07.322
<i>♪ Now that's the way I'm keeping it
Now. Mama. dear ♪</i>

1659
01:39:08.156 --> 01:39:10.992
But things weren't going that great.

1660
01:39:11.868 --> 01:39:15.538
It wasn't at the big beach-- I mean.
things had calmed down quite a bit.

1661
01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.958
Beach Boys were hurting.

1662
01:39:22.462 --> 01:39:24.297
We were kinda on our last leg.

1663
01:39:25.131 --> 01:39:28.009
We all just felt we needed to get away
and reinvent ourselves.

1664
01:39:28.009 --> 01:39:32.013
And we had never been outside of
the United States in terms of recording.

1665
01:39:32.555 --> 01:39:34.432
And so. we went to Holland.

1666
01:39:35.684 --> 01:39:38.978
We were true to our music.
but we were on a downward spiral.

1667
01:39:40.063 --> 01:39:43.775
They go from being
one of the most globally-known pop artists

1668
01:39:43.775 --> 01:39:45.610
to. some degree. falling off the map.

1669
01:39:46.528 --> 01:39:50.573
There's no thought process
that was governing the group

1670
01:39:50.573 --> 01:39:51.950
that made any sense at all.

1671
01:39:52.867 --> 01:39:55.036
And then Capitol.
unbeknownst to us.

1672
01:39:55.036 --> 01:39:57.789
decides to release
kind of like a big "Best of."

1673
01:39:58.331 --> 01:40:01.334
<i>Twenty of your favorite
original Beach Boys hits are now together</i>

1674
01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:04.045
<i>in a fabulous two-record set.
called</i> Endless Summer<i>.</i>

1675
01:40:04.045 --> 01:40:10.135
<i>♪ Do you love me
Do you. surfer girl ♪</i>

1676
01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:12.679
The songs
were all from the early albums.

1677
01:40:13.471 --> 01:40:15.390
<i>♪ Get her out of my heart ♪</i>

1678
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:18.143
It represented an era of positivity.

1679
01:40:18.143 --> 01:40:21.312
<i>♪ And she'll have fun. fun. fun
'til her daddy takes the T-bird away ♪</i>

1680
01:40:21.312 --> 01:40:25.025
And <i>Endless Summer</i>
became a number one smash album.

1681
01:40:26.026 --> 01:40:29.779
All of a sudden.
there's a new generation of record buyers.

1682
01:40:29.779 --> 01:40:32.073
So to them. it's all brand-new.

1683
01:40:32.073 --> 01:40:35.660
<i>♪ I wish they all could be
California girls ♪</i>

1684
01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:39.414
It was funny. That image we were
trying to get away from...

1685
01:40:39.414 --> 01:40:40.832
It's what saved us.

1686
01:40:42.625 --> 01:40:44.669
And that reenergized our career.

1687
01:40:45.503 --> 01:40:46.963
We got a second chance.

1688
01:40:46.963 --> 01:40:50.175
<i>♪ If everybody had an ocean... ♪</i>

1689
01:40:50.175 --> 01:40:54.054
You gotta remember.
they've been a touring band forever.

1690
01:40:54.054 --> 01:40:58.224
<i>♪ Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californ-I-A ♪</i>

1691
01:40:58.224 --> 01:41:01.644
They're one of the few bands
that could reproduce their sound.

1692
01:41:08.985 --> 01:41:10.820
The Beatles stopped touring.

1693
01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:13.114
largely. in part.
because they couldn't play the stuff live.

1694
01:41:13.114 --> 01:41:18.661
<i>♪ I hear the sound of a gentle word ♪</i>

1695
01:41:19.371 --> 01:41:23.041
I can't imagine pulling off half
the stuff that The Beach Boys recorded.

1696
01:41:25.085 --> 01:41:27.253
And then
we started doing stadiums.

1697
01:41:27.253 --> 01:41:30.090
<i>♪ And after having spent
The day together ♪</i>

1698
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:33.843
<i>♪ Hold each other close
The whole night through ♪</i>

1699
01:41:35.804 --> 01:41:38.598
And that's when
the 8-to-80 thing started happening.

1700
01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:41.851
We had the eight-year-olds coming.
and the 80-year-olds were coming.

1701
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.318
We benefited by the fact

1702
01:41:50.318 --> 01:41:54.948
that our songs resonate with young people
no matter what generation they're in.

1703
01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.202
It's so great to be a part of that.

1704
01:41:59.202 --> 01:42:03.373
and the fact that my cousin Brian and I
got together and wrote some great songs

1705
01:42:03.373 --> 01:42:04.958
that people still like to hear.

1706
01:42:05.875 --> 01:42:10.130
However. because my uncle Murry
sold the publishing.

1707
01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:11.548
we didn't own the songs.

1708
01:42:12.966 --> 01:42:16.302
So he screwed his own sons
and grandchildren.

1709
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:24.853
At the beginning.
they depended on Murry.

1710
01:42:24.853 --> 01:42:28.064
And if there was no Murry.
there would be no Beach Boys.

1711
01:42:28.815 --> 01:42:33.862
But Murry didn't have the vision to see
what the catalog would bring in.

1712
01:42:34.612 --> 01:42:36.614
The hundreds of millions of dollars.

1713
01:42:37.782 --> 01:42:40.201
You know. and he sold this thing
for. like. 700.000.

1714
01:42:44.205 --> 01:42:48.626
Because Murry did not credit me
on the songs I cowrote with Brian.

1715
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:54.049
the only avenue I thought that I had
to get credit was to file a lawsuit.

1716
01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.803
I think that was kinda where we lost it.

1717
01:43:03.641 --> 01:43:07.937
I go. "Wait a minute. guys.
Hold on here. What's the deal?" You know?

1718
01:43:10.398 --> 01:43:15.070
After that.
we sort of got separated a little bit.

1719
01:43:22.827 --> 01:43:25.663
There have been ups and downs
in our relationship...

1720
01:43:30.126 --> 01:43:33.004
and. these days.
we don't really talk much.

1721
01:43:38.718 --> 01:43:42.305
But. you know. if I could.
I'd probably just tell him...

1722
01:43:48.061 --> 01:43:49.145
that I love him.

1723
01:43:52.023 --> 01:43:53.024
And nothing...

1724
01:43:55.151 --> 01:43:57.904
anybody could do could erase that.

1725
01:44:05.203 --> 01:44:10.291
<i>♪ Gotta keep
Those lovin' good vibrations ♪</i>

1726
01:44:10.291 --> 01:44:12.377
<i>♪ A-happenin' with you ♪</i>

1727
01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:17.966
<i>♪ Gotta keep
Those lovin' good vibrations ♪</i>

1728
01:44:17.966 --> 01:44:20.468
<i>♪ A-happenin' with you ♪</i>

1729
01:44:20.468 --> 01:44:25.557
<i>♪ Gotta keep
Those lovin' good vibrations ♪</i>

1730
01:44:25.557 --> 01:44:27.142
<i>♪ A-happenin' with you ♪</i>

1731
01:44:27.767 --> 01:44:31.855
I asked Brian one time.
"Why do you think we succeeded?"

1732
01:44:33.148 --> 01:44:36.651
He said. "Well. I think the music
celebrated the joy of life

1733
01:44:37.736 --> 01:44:39.863
in a real simple way.

1734
01:44:40.572 --> 01:44:43.158
Just a real direct experience
of joyfulness."

1735
01:44:50.665 --> 01:44:54.002
Their music was part
of a widespread desire

1736
01:44:54.002 --> 01:44:57.839
to believe in the possibility
of a California dream.

1737
01:44:58.506 --> 01:45:01.092
even if it doesn't seem to line up
in neat ways.

1738
01:45:09.976 --> 01:45:12.645
A band who's known for surfing
who didn't surf.

1739
01:45:14.022 --> 01:45:16.024
A band that's synonymous with the beach

1740
01:45:16.024 --> 01:45:18.943
that record songs
about staying in your room.

1741
01:45:23.114 --> 01:45:28.745
They represent much more complexity than.
I think. most people give them credit for.

1742
01:45:29.287 --> 01:45:31.289
There's someone with us tonight.

1743
01:45:31.289 --> 01:45:34.542
He's responsible for us being here. period.

1744
01:45:34.542 --> 01:45:36.961
Let's hear it for Brian! Come on!

1745
01:45:36.961 --> 01:45:40.173
They soundtrack
the best parts of life.

1746
01:45:40.757 --> 01:45:43.343
And their sound is one of one.

1747
01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:48.348
But I think none of them would have been
able to shine without each other.

1748
01:45:57.774 --> 01:46:01.569
A lot of people
have a favorite in the group. you know?

1749
01:46:01.569 --> 01:46:04.656
But a group is a group.

1750
01:46:09.953 --> 01:46:12.414
The Beach Boys are a family story.

1751
01:46:14.124 --> 01:46:16.292
not without its ups and downs.

1752
01:46:18.003 --> 01:46:21.006
but the positivity
far outweighs the negativity.

1753
01:46:46.448 --> 01:46:47.615
