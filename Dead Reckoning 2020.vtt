00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.301
Attention please.

4
00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.970
Thank you. at this
time I would like

5
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.571
to turn this news
conference over

6
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.974
to FBI regional director of
public affairs.

7
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.776
James Gardner. who is
going to give us

8
00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.344
more information on the
investigation.

9
00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.245
Thank you.

10
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.315
Thank you. Chief Oswald.

11
00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.051
I'll take a few
questions in a moment.

12
00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:50.952
but please keep in mind that

13
00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.520
this is still an active
investigation.

14
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.022
I ask for your patience

15
00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.423
and that you would hold

16
00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.392
any unnecessary or
inflammatory speculation.

17
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.999
The suspect. Tador Bushati. 53.
was killed

18
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.566
in his Brooklyn apartment during

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.770
an interview with the
FBI investigating

20
00:01:08.803 --> 00:01:11.973
the New York city subway
bombing this past fall.

21
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.377
Relax pal. put you hands in
the air. real slow.

22
00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.325
The agent involved in
the shooting

23
00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.362
at peregrine avenue
and sixth street

24
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.397
was following a lead
when Bushati

25
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.401
initiated a violent
confrontation and was killed.

26
00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.708
I want your contact
and the money.

27
00:01:47.742 --> 00:01:48.642
I don't got it.

28
00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.342
Bullshit.

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.817
That's all we have for an
official statement

30
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.785
at that this time. I'll take a
couple of questions.

31
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.391
What evidence connects

32
00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.626
the dead suspect to the
subway bombing?

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.730
I'm not at liberty to discuss
any evidence at this time.

34
00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.573
Mother fuck.

35
00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.145
I want the names and the money.

36
00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:25.112
Fuck you.

37
00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.446
No. fuck you.

38
00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:31.685
Give me your wallet.

39
00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.492
Yes.

40
00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.428
Sir. a local police
source reported

41
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.130
no other firearms on
the scene besides

42
00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:44.866
the loan FBI agents weapon.

43
00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.368
Suspect was armed with a
butcher's knife.

44
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.137
Chump change.

45
00:02:52.173 --> 00:02:56.110
Tador Bushati. your license is
expired. imagine that

46
00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:03.617
Your family. huh?

47
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.785
Fuck you.

48
00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.989
I think it is. you know. I think
I'll just keep this one.

49
00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.371
Wouldn't you say

50
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.872
that was an excessive
use of force?

51
00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:28.075
Absolutely not. our agents are
trained to respond

52
00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.677
with deadly force no matter
what the weapon.

53
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.214
That's all the time I have.
thank you very much.

54
00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:43.958

Twin Cessna November 247 echo

59
00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:57.939
You're half a mile from
uptight intersection.

turn left at 080 degrees.
maintain 2.300 feet.

61
00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.978
Intercepter replies you're clear

Rodger Nantucket tower.

63
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.249
Hi. honey. we're about to
lead in Nantucket.

64
00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.251
So we're a little bit late.
I know.

65
00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:13.486
Here. nobody's more
excited than Flounder.

66
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.188
Say hi to baby.

67
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:15.189
I'm trying to talk to the tower.

68
00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.290
keep my eyes on the numbers.

69
00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:19.226
Okay. all right. we love you.
we'll see you soon.

70
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.861
We're losing altitude. honey!

71
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:21.729
Hold on!

72
00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:05.239
Okay. everyone it's
thumper time!

73
00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.243
It's thumper time.

74
00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:14.782
What's the name of the game?

75
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:15.816
Thumper!

76
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.118
Why do we play?

77
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.886
To get fucked up!

78
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.122
Please language. ladies
and gentlemen.

79
00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.156
Oh shut up.

80
00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:25.092
Oh my God.

81
00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.193
Continue.

82
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:36.737
You fucked up. drink.

83
00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.576
I'll never keep up
without Tillie.

84
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.980
And where would she be?

85
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.647
She's biking here.

86
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.581
At night?

87
00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:49.984
A wise decision considering

88
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.886
her license has been suspended.

89
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.889
I've been sober one night this
week and I'm driving.

90
00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.589
Oh great. you're my ride.

91
00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:00.061
So since her parents died
Tillie's been drunk for weeks.

92
00:06:00.094 --> 00:06:02.196
Months. still counting.

93
00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.266
Tillie!

94
00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.300
Tillie my love.

95
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.201
Hey babe.

96
00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.602
The night is saved.

97
00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:10.971
You had a head start.

98
00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:11.872
Yes.

99
00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:15.910
Oh.

100
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.813
For dear Tillie I would alter

101
00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.315
my sexual orientation to
whatever her preference.

102
00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:24.752
Oh you.

103
00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:25.652
Niko.

104
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:33.794
My man.

105
00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.265
Any success with your
acquisition of contraband?

106
00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.233
Have I ever let you down?

107
00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:40.201
No.

108
00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.704
Lou would go down for good weed.

109
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.906
I genuinely resemble
that remark.

110
00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:50.077
Niko. meet my two
dearest flowers.

111
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:52.880
Felicity going to Berkeley. and
Tillie going to Columbia.

112
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.415
Leave it to Oxford
boy to introduce

113
00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:56.817
us by our lesser schools.

114
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:59.220
I see you've found some
more dearest buds.

115
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.922
Nothing quite like the aroma
of central Oregon.

116
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:06.227
My immigrant compadre here
is going to BC.

117
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.027
Nice to meet you.

118
00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:11.631
Congratulations. Colombia. it's
a really nice school.

119
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.836
We haven't seen you
around before.

120
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.171
It's only my second
summer on the island.

121
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.306
but my first altar rock.
thanks to Lou.

122
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.375
Oh. and you're working
for living that.

123
00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:23.277
that is. that is refreshing.

124
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.779
You know. Lou here thinks that
he's working class

125
00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:27.114
since he got a job turning

126
00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:29.350
on the sprinklers at the
Nantucket golf club.

127
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:31.719
It's true.

128
00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:36.891
Welcome.

129
00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:46.767
That's a disqualification
before the first round.

130
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.968
Such a pity.

131
00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:59.079
I think I need to go home.

132
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:02.316
Would you prefer my escort?

133
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.152
I'm sober. I can
give her a ride.

134
00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:07.154
Till. do you want me
to go with you?

135
00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:10.090
No. you just stay. have fun.

136
00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:10.991
Wait.

137
00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:15.129
Don't forget your mouthwash.

138
00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:21.735
Whoa. you okay.

139
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:22.903
Yeah. oh my bike.

140
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.105
This man is a
veritable stranger.

141
00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:28.375
He's your man. your compadre.

142
00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.077
You just introduced us.

143
00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:33.781
You broke your bike.

144
00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.282
Yeah. I fell.

145
00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.850
Don't worry. I'll get it
fixed for you.

146
00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:38.886
I've got some friends for that.

147
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.888
An immigrant and a gentlemen.

148
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.792
I understand him more than
I understand you

149
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:47.094
and your weird
version of English.

150
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.930
I can speak English properly.
too.

151
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:51.332
Okay?

152
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.170
You boarding school boy. such
pretentious bullshit.

153
00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:04.945
What's up with the rain?

154
00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.413
Because it's Nantucket silly.

155
00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:12.786
So embarrassed.

156
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.054
I'm used to it.

157
00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:16.557
What. people puking when
they meet you?

158
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.360
No. giving someone a ride when
they really need one.

159
00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:22.029
You're sweet.

160
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.067
You want?

161
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:27.935
No. I'm driving.

162
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:36.910
You okay?

163
00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.012
Stop the car.

164
00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:38.879
Huh?

165
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:39.880
Stop the car.

166
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:40.547
Here?

167
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:41.448
Yeah. come on.

168
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:44.852
Come on.

169
00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.316
Come in.

170
00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.384
No. I'm okay. I'm good.

171
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.305
Here.

172
00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:40.507
God. you must be freezing.

173
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.443
No. no. the water's warm.

174
00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:54.288
Why didn't you come in?

175
00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:56.056
I can't swim.

176
00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.194
You live on an island silly.
gotta swim.

177
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.462
Yeah I know.

178
00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:02.896
Maybe you could teach me.

179
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:05.599
I'd like to.

180
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.577
Whoa. nice lights.

181
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.012
Yeah. ready for the fourth.

182
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:26.186
So all those guys at altar rock.

183
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.388
are they all your friends?

184
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.357
As long as I can remember.

185
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:31.558
We're here every summer.

186
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.929
Well. anytime you need a ride.

187
00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:36.997
I'll remember.

188
00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:39.933
Here's my cell.

189
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.071
Call me so I have yours.

190
00:11:56.517 --> 00:11:57.551
And I'll take care of your bike

191
00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:59.253
and call you when it's ready.

192
00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:09.496
Wouldn't want to get
you in trouble.

193
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.364
No.

194
00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:16.003
Bye.

195
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.204
Bye.

196
00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:52.072
Where do you think you're going?

197
00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:55.209
I almost called the police.

198
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.109
Come over here.

199
00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:07.722
Sorry aunt Jenny. I know I
should have called.

200
00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:10.324
I was up at altar rock. there
was no signal up there.

201
00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:13.093
I know altar rock.
that's why I worry.

202
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.696
You're not my mother.

203
00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:22.202
Jennifer is just as worried as
your mother would be.

204
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.676
Look. we just graduated.
it's summer

205
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.514
and we're all going to college
soon so we went for a swim.

206
00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.485
You never heard of
skinny dipping?

207
00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:43.056
Okay. definitely not
something mom would say.

208
00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.126
What would she say about a DUI?

209
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.529
I don't know. she's dead.

210
00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:49.797
Where's your license?

211
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:51.733
Hey. just take it easy.
all right?

212
00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.469
Go take a hot shower.

213
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:02.643
That was Tramary by Shumont.

214
00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.846
Only two days left till
fourth of July.

215
00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.346
Hope everyone up
there in Nantucket

216
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.849
has a happy independence day.

217
00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:26.801
It's been every night now.

218
00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:30.671
You were like this when we met.

219
00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:34.308
Yes. but I didn't have

220
00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:36.143
to cope with losing parents.

221
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.279
I'm really worried about Tillie.

222
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:44.151
I know Chris. I've been there
and she's on her way there.

223
00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:48.823
Here. I'm here for
you and Tillie.

224
00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:49.690
Okay?

225
00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:50.557
Kay.

226
00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:23.624
Hi.

227
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.863
I'm FBI agent Richard Cantrell.

228
00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:31.365
Phyllis. if you've got a moment.

229
00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:32.800
I'd like to ask you a
few questions.

230
00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:33.700
For sure.

231
00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.739
According to my reports. this
is the last airfield

232
00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.406
that the Gardeners flew out of

233
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.809
on route to Nantucket.
when plane crashed.

234
00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:43.945
Did you know them?

235
00:15:43.978 --> 00:15:45.612
James and Celeste?

236
00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.882
Bummer. really sucks.

237
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.217
What we're doing is
we're looking

238
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.653
at the possibility of an
aircraft tampering.

239
00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:54.588
Oh wow.

240
00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:58.592
So I'm going to need to see
your maintenance logs

241
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.628
and the hard drive to the
security monitoring system.

242
00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:05.800
Well. yeah. whatever.
have at it.

243
00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.469
Thank you Phyllis.

244
00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:10.370
Your a dream.

245
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.912
Well. don't look so
disappointed.

246
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:21.783
She'll be down in a minute.

247
00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:22.917
Please come in.

248
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.818
I don't bite.

249
00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:26.253
Niko.

250
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.390
Jennifer Crane aunt Jenny to
Tillie and her friends.

251
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:31.391
Very nice to meet you.

252
00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:35.730
Oh. I volunteer at the
battered women's clinic.

253
00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:38.632
I'm so glad I get the chance to
meet you. close the door.

254
00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:42.402
Can I get you
something to drink?

255
00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.404
I'm okay. thank you.

256
00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:46.473
So what do you do on the island?

257
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.475
I drive a cab. saving
for college.

258
00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:53.513
Tillie. Niko's here.

259
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.318
That's a good thing. kids here.

260
00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.653
they just take
Nantucket for granted.

261
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.655
No responsibilities.

262
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.990
Why'd you come?

263
00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:04.658
Eat.

264
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.493
My mother used to work here
a long time ago.

265
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.295
Nantucket was her
favorite place.

266
00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:09.897
Your mother has very good taste.

267
00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:12.265
She did.

268
00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:16.269
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:19.539
Where are you from?

270
00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:21.508
Well. I grew up here. I
mean in America.

271
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.044
but I was born in Albania.

272
00:17:23.077 --> 00:17:25.445
Ah. that's where the good
looks come from.

273
00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:27.982
Okay. let's go.

274
00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:28.850
Here let me help.

275
00:17:28.883 --> 00:17:29.683
Thanks.

276
00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:34.354
Niko told me he drives a taxi
to save for college.

277
00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:37.457
Terrific.

278
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.391
Later aunt Jenny.

279
00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:03.951
That looks beautiful.

280
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:04.986
Good as new.

281
00:18:05.953 --> 00:18:06.653
I hope so.

282
00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:12.860
How well do you know Nantucket?

283
00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:15.096
I do drive a cab. but I don't
get much time off.

284
00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:17.799
Oh. I'm going to have to
show you around then.

285
00:18:17.832 --> 00:18:18.665
Now?

286
00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:19.633
Yeah. come on.

287
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:23.004
Come on.

288
00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:55.635
So how about that
swimming lesson?

289
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:57.404
No. I'll take a rain check.

290
00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.986
What are you going to major in.
in Boston college?

291
00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:13.520
You know I'm not sure.

292
00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:14.554
What do you suggest?

293
00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:17.959
What do you think
about engineering?

294
00:19:17.992 --> 00:19:20.460
I'm mechanical. I could do that.

295
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.662
How about dentistry?

296
00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:24.732
No. I couldn't. no. no.

297
00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:25.632
Architecture.

298
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.168
Yeah.

299
00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:29.469
I'd love to design and
build houses someday.

300
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:34.407
Single file. you rookie shit
heels. single file.

301
00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:40.547
Are you okay?

302
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.716
Yeah. I'm fine.

303
00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:47.520
Hey. hey!

304
00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:57.430
You okay?

305
00:19:57.464 --> 00:19:58.132
I'm fine.

306
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:01.568
Such a jerk.

307
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:02.737
What did you say to him?

308
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:06.040
I told him to have a nice day.

309
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.743
Is that Italian?

310
00:20:08.776 --> 00:20:10.211
I took some in high school.

311
00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:11.312
It was Albanian.

312
00:20:11.345 --> 00:20:14.447
It slipped. people often mistake
and we encourage it.

313
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:16.851
Nobody wants to be from
anywhere like Albania.

314
00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:18.886
No in America. it
doesn't matter.

315
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.154
My great grandmother. Matilda.

316
00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:22.089
She was a roma gypsy.

317
00:20:22.123 --> 00:20:22.857
You have gypsy blood.

318
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:27.560
Well do like we do then. say
you're from Northern Italy.

319
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.171
Thanks for the headshot asshole.

320
00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:19.447
Agent Hanley.

321
00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:22.850
Hey. Robert I've got the
son of a bitch.

322
00:21:22.883 --> 00:21:23.583
You did?

323
00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.087
Yeah. he's headed to Nantucket.

324
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.154
Nantucket?

325
00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:29.991
Yeah. look. this was revenge.

326
00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:31.691
James's. his daughter.
my God daughter.

327
00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.294
Tillie lives on Nantucket.

328
00:21:33.327 --> 00:21:35.595
She could be next.

329
00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.564
I can't do this solo anymore.

330
00:21:37.597 --> 00:21:38.498
I need your help.

331
00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:40.533
Got your back.

332
00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:43.270
Thanks. just meet me there
as soon as you can

333
00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:44.872
I'm on my way.

334
00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:47.942
Good ride.

335
00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:49.210
Yeah.

336
00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:50.277
I hope you're legs okay.

337
00:21:50.311 --> 00:21:51.145
Oh. it'll be fine.

338
00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:52.046
You sure?

339
00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.048
Yeah. I'm accident prone.

340
00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.854
That's a beautiful house.

341
00:22:01.122 --> 00:22:03.623
Well. you just gave me the
most beautiful day.

342
00:22:53.874 --> 00:22:57.211
Do I sense a new
romance blossoming?

343
00:22:57.244 --> 00:22:58.879
We were just having fun okay?

344
00:23:00.081 --> 00:23:02.216
All right. the summer thing.
before Columbia.

345
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:05.286
Come on. let's walk
on the beach.

346
00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.921
No more Columbia talk.

347
00:23:06.954 --> 00:23:09.090
All right. let's talk
about Berkeley.

348
00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:11.292
I'm kidding.

349
00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:11.792
Jeez.

350
00:23:11.826 --> 00:23:12.625
Better be kidding.

351
00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:13.461
You know. I really
would just want

352
00:23:13.494 --> 00:23:16.363
to hear about your new boy.
Niko.

353
00:23:16.397 --> 00:23:17.865
Maybe.

354
00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:19.100
What. maybe?

355
00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.234
At some point.

356
00:23:20.267 --> 00:23:21.335
At some point?

357
00:23:21.368 --> 00:23:22.136
At some point what?

358
00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:23.137
Like where. when?

359
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.139
Hey but you know what. I really.
really. really

360
00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:26.240
excited for that fourth
of July party.

361
00:23:26.273 --> 00:23:27.074
Oh yeah.

362
00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:27.908
It's gonna be so fun.

363
00:23:27.942 --> 00:23:28.608
It's gonna be good.

364
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:30.111
Just before we have to go off

365
00:23:30.144 --> 00:23:31.846
and be adults I guess.

366
00:23:31.879 --> 00:23:32.847
We're hardly adults.

367
00:23:49.797 --> 00:23:52.699
Dock master to horn blower
welcome to Nantucket.

368
00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:54.268
A light hand lizard on
that position.

369
00:25:01.802 --> 00:25:03.037
Marco!

370
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.772
Look who it is!

371
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:06.840
Holy shit. look at this boat.

372
00:25:06.874 --> 00:25:08.409
It's nice. right?

373
00:25:08.442 --> 00:25:11.245
Come on. come on. let
down the gangway.

374
00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:13.280
Come on board. I'm coming.

375
00:25:16.951 --> 00:25:18.152
We need to celebrate.

376
00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:20.387
This is not a special occasion.
huh?

377
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:23.157
The two of us together again.
after such a long time.

378
00:25:26.927 --> 00:25:29.863
Look at you. big. strong.

379
00:25:29.897 --> 00:25:31.465
Man no longer a child huh?

380
00:25:31.498 --> 00:25:32.800
I've been working hard.

381
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:34.768
Working hard. that's good. good.

382
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.938
You still in the same place
or you move on?

383
00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:40.140
Yeah. everything's the same.

384
00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:43.177
Well don't worry. I'm here now.

385
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.045
We're going to change that. want
to drink espresso or what?

386
00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:45.746
Yeah.

387
00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:46.647
Come on. it's good to see you.

388
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.782
So how did you like the
truck I got you?

389
00:25:48.816 --> 00:25:49.450
I love it.

390
00:25:49.483 --> 00:25:50.484
All the guys are jealous.

391
00:25:51.352 --> 00:25:52.286
It's beautiful out.

392
00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:53.787
Yeah.

393
00:25:53.821 --> 00:25:54.488
So pretty.

394
00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:02.563
Nobody's more excited
then Flounder.

395
00:26:02.596 --> 00:26:03.564
Honey. hold on!

396
00:26:03.597 --> 00:26:07.101
What if he's only using you
for a green card?

397
00:26:07.134 --> 00:26:09.103
He's already got one.
it's not like that.

398
00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:14.074
Niko's world is different.

399
00:26:15.843 --> 00:26:17.544
He moves inside it calmly.

400
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:21.282
He's real. you know?

401
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:23.817
I get that.

402
00:26:25.052 --> 00:26:27.521
But do you even know what
country he's from?

403
00:26:27.554 --> 00:26:29.023
America.

404
00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:31.191
No. I meant originally.

405
00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:33.827
Northern Italy.

406
00:26:35.129 --> 00:26:37.564
Well. I mean. he is
really hot so.

407
00:26:39.199 --> 00:26:41.402
You have my vote to let him in.

408
00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:42.436
Oh. thanks.

409
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.011
Hi sir. ticket to Nantucket?

410
00:26:51.912 --> 00:26:53.180
Yes sir.

411
00:26:53.213 --> 00:26:54.048
How you doing?

412
00:26:54.081 --> 00:26:54.915
Good thank you.

413
00:26:54.948 --> 00:26:56.083
245 Cantrell.

414
00:26:56.116 --> 00:26:56.950
Cantrell?

415
00:26:56.984 --> 00:26:57.618
Yes sir.

416
00:26:57.651 --> 00:26:59.453
No charge. go ahead.

417
00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:19.940
Show me this video.

418
00:27:21.075 --> 00:27:24.244
I want to see this famous 4th of
July Nantucket party.

419
00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:32.152
This is 4th of July
last time summer.

420
00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:33.087
It was amazing.

421
00:27:34.521 --> 00:27:36.390
It was so much fun.
we had a blast.

422
00:27:36.423 --> 00:27:37.891
You would love it.

423
00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:45.466
6.000 fat. rich. drunk
American babies

424
00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:47.501
who are chanting USA. USA.

425
00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:51.372
Barking like dogs who think
they own the world.

426
00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:55.909
Shut them up right.

427
00:28:03.617 --> 00:28:05.619
You did good my brother.

428
00:28:07.054 --> 00:28:08.589
Come here with our mother.

429
00:28:08.622 --> 00:28:10.991
Go to school. make friends.

430
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:12.526
Learn to speak good English.

431
00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:14.561
you get the job and
the green card.

432
00:28:17.965 --> 00:28:19.500
And when our father is butchered

433
00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:21.602
by the FBI you do
not even blink.

434
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.206
You do not forget but
you don't blink.

435
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.241
Like a true solider.

436
00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:30.911
He would be proud of you.

437
00:28:34.214 --> 00:28:35.048
Look Marco. I.

438
00:28:35.082 --> 00:28:36.150
No. don't talk.

439
00:28:36.183 --> 00:28:38.352
Just listen. come on.

440
00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:10.284
It's nice to get here
before the others.

441
00:29:10.317 --> 00:29:11.185
Yeah.

442
00:29:22.062 --> 00:29:25.032
You know I don't know anything
about your family.

443
00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:27.401
Who do you have to
endlessly nag you?

444
00:29:27.434 --> 00:29:28.302
Nobody.

445
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.205
You say that so.

446
00:29:33.474 --> 00:29:35.242
I've been on my own three years.

447
00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:40.013
Your father. your mother?

448
00:29:41.448 --> 00:29:42.316
They all died.

449
00:29:45.185 --> 00:29:46.386
Oh God.

450
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.291
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:52.192
It's okay.

452
00:29:55.095 --> 00:29:56.530
Hey. it's okay. what's wrong?

453
00:30:03.103 --> 00:30:04.371
Let me show you something.

454
00:30:09.276 --> 00:30:12.112
Hi honey. we're about to
land in Nantucket.

455
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:14.348
So we're a little bit
late I know.

456
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:16.718
nobody's more excited
than Flounder.

457
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:17.785
Say hi to my baby.

458
00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:20.120
I'm trying to talk to the tower.
keep my eyes open.

459
00:30:20.153 --> 00:30:23.257
Okay. all right. we love you.
we'll see you soon.

460
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.324
We're losing altitude.

461
00:30:24.358 --> 00:30:25.592
Honey. hold on!

462
00:30:30.697 --> 00:30:32.566
God. that's horrible.

463
00:30:40.742 --> 00:30:42.810
That was the last
time I saw them.

464
00:30:45.445 --> 00:30:48.615
See. we're both orphans.

465
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.486
Only you're like a
veteran at it.

466
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:55.823
I'm still a rookie.

467
00:30:57.825 --> 00:31:01.295
Maybe three years from now
when somebody asks me

468
00:31:01.328 --> 00:31:06.333
about my parents. I can be as
calm and collected as you.

469
00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:08.803
No. no. I hope not.

470
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:17.812
Do not participate in any

471
00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:19.747
lascivious
activities without me.

472
00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:25.753
What's up Lou?

473
00:31:25.787 --> 00:31:26.687
Oh. forgive me.

474
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:27.755
How could you?

475
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:29.656
I possess the liquid
sex enhancers.

476
00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:32.225
Niko. my good man.
are your herbal

477
00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:33.327
coffers sufficiently stocked?

478
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.562
Of course. of course.

479
00:31:35.596 --> 00:31:36.731
Hey careful.

480
00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:38.498
It's just Lou. there's no
one else here.

481
00:31:38.532 --> 00:31:39.399
Just old Lou.

482
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.470
Fuck. fuck. this fucking hill.

483
00:31:43.503 --> 00:31:47.608
Oh and for edification
Felicity has prematurely

484
00:31:47.641 --> 00:31:50.177
forfeited any duties as a
designated driver tonight.

485
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.545
Oh shut up. I'm perfect.

486
00:31:52.847 --> 00:31:55.717
Oh shit. fuck. this
fucking hill.

487
00:32:19.573 --> 00:32:20.775
I'd like to thank you all

488
00:32:20.808 --> 00:32:24.144
for coming today and sharing
your stories with each other.

489
00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:28.348
I know this is a very
difficult process.

490
00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:30.550
but remember our strength
is in our group.

491
00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:34.756
Now. today is a very special
day for one of us.

492
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:37.190
It's the first
anniversary for Jennifer.

493
00:32:44.866 --> 00:32:47.501
Keep it up and give a hug
to Tillie for me.

494
00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:48.201
Thank you pastor.

495
00:32:49.436 --> 00:32:51.773
I couldn't have done it
without each of you.

496
00:33:00.014 --> 00:33:01.716
Hey Jen.

497
00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:03.751
Oh my God. Richard.

498
00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:05.285
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

499
00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:07.387
How are you. why
didn't you call?

500
00:33:09.556 --> 00:33:11.324
Jen I has some disturbing news.

501
00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:15.295
The NTSB salvaged James's
is the aircraft

502
00:33:15.328 --> 00:33:16.396
and we now have evidence that

503
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.532
there was tampering
with the plane.

504
00:33:18.565 --> 00:33:19.499
What?

505
00:33:19.533 --> 00:33:21.501
Do you remember a man
named Tador Bushati?

506
00:33:22.904 --> 00:33:25.639
The suspect in the New York
subway bombings last fall.

507
00:33:25.672 --> 00:33:26.708
The one who died in FBI custody?

508
00:33:26.741 --> 00:33:27.407
Yes.

509
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:28.508
How does that relate to Jane?

510
00:33:28.542 --> 00:33:32.579
James was the public face of the
FBI for television.

511
00:33:34.548 --> 00:33:35.983
Revenge?

512
00:33:36.017 --> 00:33:36.884
I believe so.

513
00:33:39.386 --> 00:33:42.589
This man maybe connected.

514
00:33:45.459 --> 00:33:46.593
Son of a bitch.

515
00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:49.629
We now know that he had
unauthorized access to James's

516
00:33:49.663 --> 00:33:51.565
aircraft the day
before it took off.

517
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.802
Are Tillie and I in danger.

518
00:33:54.836 --> 00:33:56.971
Absolutely. that's why I'm here.

519
00:33:58.773 --> 00:34:00.007
Send that to me.

520
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:00.908
Of course.

521
00:34:02.342 --> 00:34:03.010
How is Tillie.

522
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:05.645
As well as can be expected.

523
00:34:07.647 --> 00:34:09.483
She's got a new boyfriend.

524
00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:10.985
Really?

525
00:34:11.018 --> 00:34:13.788
He's a hardworking kid
from Eastern Europe

526
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:14.756
and he's cute too.

527
00:34:16.556 --> 00:34:18.558
How are your sisters boys?

528
00:34:18.592 --> 00:34:19.761
Coping. thank you.

529
00:34:22.662 --> 00:34:25.665
It's been a
nightmare since 9/11.

530
00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:26.801
Who knows what's next.

531
00:34:28.703 --> 00:34:29.569
Did it go through?

532
00:34:31.072 --> 00:34:32.073
Got it.

533
00:34:32.106 --> 00:34:33.007
Okay.

534
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.208
You know where to find me.

535
00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:38.345
If you see anything or you need
anything. just call me.

536
00:35:04.105 --> 00:35:06.073
Hey Joe. we got enough
Triple A stocked?

537
00:35:06.107 --> 00:35:06.941
Absolutely.

538
00:35:06.974 --> 00:35:07.842
Great. great.

539
00:35:09.143 --> 00:35:11.344
Hey sweetie. can you push
back those tables?

540
00:35:11.378 --> 00:35:13.815
We need to get ready for a big
4th of July party tonight.

541
00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:17.384
so let's just make some dance
for our hot DJ tonight.

542
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:20.587
Some of the richest people

543
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.589
in America live
along this beach.

544
00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:26.393
You got all these mansions.
soon enough

545
00:35:26.426 --> 00:35:28.830
they're gonna fall
into the ocean.

546
00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:29.764
Climate change.

547
00:35:35.803 --> 00:35:36.904
It's so messed up.

548
00:35:36.938 --> 00:35:40.107
Multimillion dollar castles
built on sliding sands.

549
00:35:43.577 --> 00:35:45.046
We created it.

550
00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:46.413
Yeah.

551
00:35:55.622 --> 00:35:57.424
It's all our fault.

552
00:35:59.193 --> 00:36:01.863
Hey. get off my beach.

553
00:36:01.896 --> 00:36:03.697
Get off my beach.

554
00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:05.132
Who are you yelling at now?

555
00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:06.566
Oh honey. go make another drink.

556
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.102
I got a drink right here.

557
00:36:08.135 --> 00:36:08.936
Whatever.

558
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.138
It's America. it's
everyone's beach.

559
00:36:11.172 --> 00:36:12.974
Are you serious?

560
00:36:13.007 --> 00:36:14.742
You see the sand by
all the grass?

561
00:36:14.775 --> 00:36:16.711
That's the high water mark.

562
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:18.145
You're worried about sand?

563
00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:20.047
Yeah. my sand.

564
00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:23.117
Out there. that's public.
that's their America.

565
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.920
Where they're sitting.
that's my America.

566
00:36:25.953 --> 00:36:27.121
They seem like nice kids.

567
00:36:27.154 --> 00:36:28.488
Oh. great kids.

568
00:36:29.522 --> 00:36:30.958
Okay. we're going.

569
00:36:30.992 --> 00:36:31.859
Yeah.

570
00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:33.693
You know what?

571
00:36:34.862 --> 00:36:35.930
Let's go somewhere else.

572
00:36:35.963 --> 00:36:37.530
Yeah.

573
00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:38.833
I'll show you my America.

574
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:25.512
Your America huh?

575
00:37:28.082 --> 00:37:29.750
Yeah.

576
00:37:29.784 --> 00:37:32.019
The one place in the
island I can't drink.

577
00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:32.787
What. why is that?

578
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:36.623
My aunt and Chris
own this place.

579
00:37:36.656 --> 00:37:38.125
God. I hope we don't
run into them.

580
00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:38.993
Who's Chris?

581
00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:40.127
Her partner.

582
00:37:47.268 --> 00:37:48.635
Hey. Rupert.

583
00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:53.473
Hey.

584
00:37:55.608 --> 00:37:57.244

Make way. all right. all right.

596

You okay?

597
00:38:27.607 --> 00:38:29.143
Yeah. I'm just looking
out for my aunt.

598
00:38:33.814 --> 00:38:34.581
Oh hey. hey. hey.

599
00:38:34.614 --> 00:38:37.151
You can dance. but

You must be Niko. I'm Chris.

601
00:38:42.223 --> 00:38:43.590
My aunts partner.

602
00:38:43.623 --> 00:38:45.558
Oh. very nice to meet you.

603

Well enjoy our Bulgarian name.

604
00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:55.002
Your aunt has very good taste.

605
00:38:55.036 --> 00:38:56.170
Runs in the family.

Oh. he's adorable.

I know its not a beagle

641
00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:41.068
but she's was the happiest
puppy at the shelter.

642
00:41:43.871 --> 00:41:44.738
You love her?

643
00:41:46.473 --> 00:41:47.374
Of course.

644
00:41:47.408 --> 00:41:49.476
What are you gonna name her?

645
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.344
Right now?

646
00:41:50.377 --> 00:41:51.212
Yeah.

647
00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:52.346
Well I don't know.

648
00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:54.048
I got to know her better first.

649
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:56.250
Don't worry. we'll figure
it out together.

650
00:41:58.285 --> 00:41:59.720
I'd like that very much.

651
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:02.356
Oh shit.

652
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.324
Aunt Jenny doesn't do dogs.

653
00:42:04.558 --> 00:42:06.293
She wouldn't even let
Flounder in the house.

654
00:42:06.327 --> 00:42:07.428
and now she's stuck with me.

655
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:10.831
Don't worry I'll take of her
until we figure that out.

656
00:42:10.864 --> 00:42:12.900
Don't forget I live with
ten dog sitters.

657
00:42:15.903 --> 00:42:18.372
Thank you. I love her.

658
00:42:22.042 --> 00:42:22.910
Thanks a lot.

659
00:42:30.918 --> 00:42:31.852
See you.

660
00:42:31.885 --> 00:42:32.519
Bye.

661
00:43:05.052 --> 00:43:08.055
Tillie. thank God you're back.

662
00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:11.225
I didn't know how to tell you
this over the phone.

663
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.126
What is it?

664
00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:15.863
Your godfather came to
see me today.

665
00:43:17.064 --> 00:43:18.832
Your mom and your dad.

666
00:43:18.866 --> 00:43:19.867
They were murdered.

667
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:22.469
It was an act of revenge.

668
00:43:23.437 --> 00:43:24.305
Revenge?

669
00:43:27.508 --> 00:43:30.110
Richard thinks it was this man.
have you seen him?

670
00:43:33.347 --> 00:43:34.214
No. no.

671
00:43:36.617 --> 00:43:38.552
He thinks he could be a
danger to us.

672
00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:16.890
Ow. ow. ow. you're hurting me.

673
00:44:18.625 --> 00:44:22.663
Ow. stop. stop. stop. ow. that
doesn't feel good. stop it.

674
00:44:22.696 --> 00:44:26.266
Oh shit. shit. sorry. sorry.

675
00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:35.909
Get out.

676
00:44:37.511 --> 00:44:39.446
I need to get dressed.

677
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.548
A woman like you has no
respect for herself.

678
00:44:41.582 --> 00:44:43.016
therefore she gets no respect.

679
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.619
Get the fuck out. Niko come on.

680
00:44:45.652 --> 00:44:47.955
Sit down. let's talk.

681
00:44:47.988 --> 00:44:49.590
You're a fucking asshole.

682
00:44:49.623 --> 00:44:50.491
Fuck you.

683
00:44:54.729 --> 00:44:56.230
Come on Niko. come on.

684
00:44:56.263 --> 00:44:57.564
Sit down. we good?

685
00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:00.300
Yeah.

686
00:45:12.379 --> 00:45:13.480
Miss.

687
00:45:13.514 --> 00:45:14.615
Get your hands off me!

688
00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:15.649
Take it easy. take it easy.

689
00:45:15.682 --> 00:45:17.484
Hey. I'm FBI.

690
00:45:17.518 --> 00:45:18.619
I'm not gonna hurt you.

691
00:45:20.354 --> 00:45:21.288
What is this. a bust?

692
00:45:21.321 --> 00:45:22.623
No. it's not a bust I just need

693
00:45:22.656 --> 00:45:24.525
to ask you a couple
of questions.

694
00:45:24.558 --> 00:45:26.460
Okay. I'm no hooker so.

695
00:45:26.493 --> 00:45:28.262
No one said you're a hooker.

696
00:45:28.295 --> 00:45:29.430
Young lady. look I
just need to talk

697
00:45:29.463 --> 00:45:31.665
to you about who's on
board that boat.

698
00:45:31.698 --> 00:45:32.734
All right?

699
00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:33.634
What's your name?

700
00:45:35.436 --> 00:45:36.336
It's Rebecca.

701
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.038
Rebecca.

702
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:40.474
I need to talk to you about
who's on that boat. okay?

703
00:45:40.507 --> 00:45:41.709
Okay.

704
00:45:41.743 --> 00:45:44.077
What were you doing on
that boat Rebecca?

705
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:48.716
The last thing I remember is
being in the club

706
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.318
and then I ended up with that
foreign. hairy pig.

707
00:45:53.353 --> 00:45:54.188
Is this the guy?

708
00:45:54.221 --> 00:45:55.088
Yes.

709
00:45:57.524 --> 00:45:59.126
He told me at a nice boat

710
00:45:59.159 --> 00:46:01.495
and that is the only true
thing he said to me.

711
00:46:01.528 --> 00:46:04.665
It doesn't make up for being a
shit and an asshole. does it?

712
00:46:04.698 --> 00:46:06.567
No it doesn't.

713
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.435
What about the other guy?

714
00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.170
No idea.

715
00:46:10.204 --> 00:46:11.171
He called him Niko.

716
00:46:12.172 --> 00:46:13.040
Niko. good.

717
00:46:14.408 --> 00:46:18.045
Listen. Rebecca. is there anyone
else on board that boat?

718
00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:20.013
Not that I know of.

719
00:46:21.114 --> 00:46:24.117
Do me a favor and keep this
conversation between us.

720
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:25.085
I want to get those guys that

721
00:46:25.118 --> 00:46:27.454
I don't want to blow this bust.
all right?

722
00:46:27.488 --> 00:46:28.322
Sure.

723
00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:30.023
No problem.

724
00:46:30.057 --> 00:46:32.059
Sober now. so won't be
blowing anything.

725
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.309
Want a drink?

726
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.218
Who's this infidel
bitch I see you

727
00:46:58.252 --> 00:47:00.487
with at the beach and the club?

728
00:47:00.521 --> 00:47:01.488
You were spying on me?

729
00:47:02.724 --> 00:47:06.660
Hey. I'm your older brother.
look out for you.

730
00:47:11.265 --> 00:47:13.500
She's a risk. she could talk.

731
00:47:13.534 --> 00:47:15.402
Never. she'd never betray me.

732
00:47:15.435 --> 00:47:16.670
Why?

733
00:47:16.704 --> 00:47:17.805
Because she wants to screw you

734
00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:19.707
like all these fucking
American whores?

735
00:47:19.741 --> 00:47:20.775
She's different.

736
00:47:21.709 --> 00:47:23.310
Maybe to you little brother.

737
00:47:24.378 --> 00:47:27.414
But to her. you're
just another toy.

738
00:47:27.447 --> 00:47:29.516
Curious little boy to play with.

739
00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:34.555
So tell me. who the fuck is she?

740
00:47:39.192 --> 00:47:40.762
She's just a local girl.

741
00:47:42.864 --> 00:47:43.630
Good.

742
00:47:44.866 --> 00:47:47.467
Then she can take you to the
fourth party with her friends

743
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:50.705
and you bring the fireworks.
yes?

744
00:47:54.709 --> 00:47:57.377
Just make sure you bring
the truck tomorrow.

745
00:48:14.328 --> 00:48:16.396
I just finished a 24 hour shift.
I need rest.

746
00:48:21.602 --> 00:48:22.603
See you tomorrow.

747
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.446
Hi honey. we're about to
land in Nantucket.

748
00:48:52.366 --> 00:48:53.533
I've been out of line.

749
00:48:58.806 --> 00:49:00.708
I'm sorry for being
so hard on you.

750
00:49:11.853 --> 00:49:13.620
You stop right there Romeo.

751
00:49:13.654 --> 00:49:14.521
Turn around.

752
00:49:15.622 --> 00:49:16.690
You think I'm kidding?

753
00:49:17.759 --> 00:49:18.760
Turn around!

754
00:49:21.495 --> 00:49:22.396
Move.

755
00:51:14.674 --> 00:51:17.677
You're little. I hate
America jihad.

756
00:51:17.712 --> 00:51:18.678
It's over.

757
00:51:24.484 --> 00:51:25.753
You fucking maniacs.

758
00:51:25.787 --> 00:51:27.755
You don't know when to stop.

759
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:32.692
9/11. New York. The Pentagon.
now here.

760
00:51:32.727 --> 00:51:36.363
well whatever you had planned.
it's not happening.

761
00:51:38.365 --> 00:51:40.735
No 72 virgins for a martyr
this time asshole.

762
00:51:43.403 --> 00:51:45.106
James Gardner was a
friend of mine.

763
00:51:45.139 --> 00:51:46.606
You made it look like
an accident.

764
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.943
No bullshit propaganda.
no credit claims.

765
00:51:48.976 --> 00:51:49.977
It was personal.

766
00:51:52.814 --> 00:51:54.548
Hey. recognize this photo?

767
00:51:55.649 --> 00:51:57.484
It's from your father's wallet.

768
00:51:57.517 --> 00:51:58.719
I'm right I?

769
00:51:58.753 --> 00:52:00.788
Like father. like sons.

770
00:52:00.822 --> 00:52:02.023
You'll be glad to know that

771
00:52:02.056 --> 00:52:04.025
your father died the
same way you will.

772
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.561
Mother fuck!

773
00:52:07.594 --> 00:52:09.696
It's personal for me
too asshole!

774
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.631
I'm here for justice.

775
00:52:11.665 --> 00:52:13.835
The subway bombing. remember?

776
00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:15.102
Your father.

777
00:52:15.136 --> 00:52:17.537
My sister was on that train.

778
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:21.541
Obliterated. there wasn't enough
left of her to bury.

779
00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:23.643
but there was something left.

780
00:52:23.677 --> 00:52:25.146
Four young boys without
their mother.

781
00:52:25.179 --> 00:52:27.514
their father a broken
useless wreck.

782
00:52:28.883 --> 00:52:29.851
I'm here for them.

783
00:52:33.553 --> 00:52:34.989
Now where's the five
million dollars

784
00:52:35.022 --> 00:52:36.090
your father was holding?

785
00:52:36.123 --> 00:52:37.390
Before you waste any more of it

786
00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:39.794
on infidel whores and big boats?

787
00:52:39.827 --> 00:52:42.730
Those boys deserve that money.
not you.

788
00:52:42.763 --> 00:52:43.865
Fuck.

789
00:52:47.534 --> 00:52:50.137
Fine. you don't care
about killing.

790
00:52:50.171 --> 00:52:51.671
You don't care about dying.

791
00:52:56.443 --> 00:52:59.914
James and Celeste Gardner.
they got death.

792
00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:00.982
But you don't care.

793
00:53:03.751 --> 00:53:08.756
My sister. and 14 other people
on that subway car got death.

794
00:53:12.994 --> 00:53:14.628
But you don't care.

795
00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:18.531
But you sure do care
about the money.

796
00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:25.639
There's something to admire
about your brand of insanity.

797
00:53:25.672 --> 00:53:30.077
I could torture you. cut
your fingers off.

798
00:53:30.111 --> 00:53:34.547
Gouge your eyes out. but you
still wouldn't talk.

799
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:36.183
But your little baby brother.
Niko?

800
00:53:39.754 --> 00:53:41.088
I don't think he's so tough.

801
00:53:44.091 --> 00:53:46.093
I'll find the money.

802
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:52.632
bomb making 101.

803
00:53:53.968 --> 00:53:58.739
That's primitive. but it's
effective grant you that.

804
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.142
My oh my.

805
00:54:01.175 --> 00:54:02.575
You have been a busy boy.

806
00:54:06.847 --> 00:54:10.952
That's just a little
too obvious. but.

807
00:54:25.598 --> 00:54:26.466
Huh?

808
00:54:28.302 --> 00:54:30.503
Yeah. it looks like we
have a winner.

809
00:54:30.537 --> 00:54:33.708
Your father had the same
kind of flash drive.

810
00:54:34.976 --> 00:54:36.043
Flushed it down the toilet.

811
00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:40.247
just before I shoved his fucking
face in afterwards.

812
00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:05.272
Marco!

813
00:55:06.606 --> 00:55:07.241
Marco!

814
00:55:07.274 --> 00:55:09.642
Niko. Niko I'm down here!

815
00:55:15.615 --> 00:55:17.550
Marco. are you okay?

816
00:55:17.584 --> 00:55:18.219
Marco.

817
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:22.890
Marco. you need a doctor.

818
00:55:23.656 --> 00:55:24.125
You bring the truck?

819
00:55:24.158 --> 00:55:25.259
Yeah.

820
00:55:25.292 --> 00:55:28.229
Okay. there's a knife up there
on the table. get it.

821
00:55:28.262 --> 00:55:29.997
You need to cut me out.

822
00:55:37.772 --> 00:55:38.638
Who's that?

823
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:43.543
It's the FBI pig who
killed father.

824
00:55:47.614 --> 00:55:49.183
He told you he killed papa?

825
00:55:49.216 --> 00:55:51.852
Yes. he was sniffing around
for the five million.

826
00:55:52.953 --> 00:55:54.188
Five million?

827
00:55:54.221 --> 00:55:57.258
Father left it to me.
money for the war.

828
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:58.159
Marco you need a doctor.

829
00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.994
I have to take you to
the hospital.

830
00:56:00.027 --> 00:56:00.995
No. no. no.

831
00:56:01.028 --> 00:56:03.364
Yes. my girls aunt has a clinic.
I can take you.

832
00:56:03.397 --> 00:56:06.699
You see those two bags up there?

833
00:56:06.734 --> 00:56:10.037
That's the special surprise
firework for the Americans.

834
00:56:10.071 --> 00:56:11.705
We have to put them in the
truck. come on.

835
00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:15.109
Help me.

836
00:56:33.693 --> 00:56:34.694
Aunt Jenny.

837
00:56:35.662 --> 00:56:37.098
Hey Niko.

838
00:56:37.131 --> 00:56:38.732
I need your help.

839
00:56:38.766 --> 00:56:39.800
What's wrong. did something
happen to Tillie?

840
00:56:39.834 --> 00:56:40.768
No. no.

841
00:56:40.801 --> 00:56:42.837
One of the cab drivers had
a bad accident.

842
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:44.371
He's a friend. he
needs your help.

843
00:56:44.405 --> 00:56:46.639
Yes. okay.

844
00:56:46.673 --> 00:56:47.308
Do you need a hospital?

845
00:56:47.341 --> 00:56:48.742
We're pretty limited here.

846
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:51.779
He's not legal.

847
00:56:53.013 --> 00:56:53.881
You understand?

848
00:56:55.182 --> 00:56:56.383
I see.

849
00:56:56.417 --> 00:56:57.985
Okay Niko bring him in.
let's have a look.

850
00:56:58.018 --> 00:56:58.886
Okay.

851
00:57:02.423 --> 00:57:04.024
This is aunt Jenny. we
can trust her.

852
00:57:05.392 --> 00:57:08.329
You'll find we have much better
stuff for pain here.

853
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.068
It's Tillie.

854
00:57:15.102 --> 00:57:17.404
Good. you go out and
talk to her.

855
00:57:17.438 --> 00:57:19.039
I'll take care of your friend.

856
00:57:22.843 --> 00:57:25.713
What sort of accident did we
have fireworks. right?

857
00:57:26.847 --> 00:57:28.048
Yes. fireworks.

858
00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:30.985
Maybe that's why
they're illegal.

859
00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:32.353
Let's have a look.

860
00:57:32.386 --> 00:57:33.454
Careful.

861
00:57:37.758 --> 00:57:39.692
This is serious.

862
00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:41.395
You're going to need the ER
at mass general.

863
00:57:41.428 --> 00:57:43.063
Oh no. no ER.

864
00:57:48.836 --> 00:57:49.937
I know you're illegal.

865
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:52.006
but we're going to have to call
an airlift for you.

866
00:59:21.495 --> 00:59:23.297
It's okay Tillie.

867
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:25.299
No. it's not okay.

868
00:59:25.332 --> 00:59:28.869
A friend of my fathers showed my
aunt the picture of the man

869
00:59:28.902 --> 00:59:33.974
and he said he killed my parents
now he's trying to kill us.

870
00:59:34.008 --> 00:59:35.309
He killed your parents?

871
00:59:37.411 --> 00:59:39.079
Okay. okay. stay where you are.

872
00:59:39.113 --> 00:59:40.981
I'll be there as soon as I can.
okay?

873
00:59:44.985 --> 00:59:45.819
Okay. bye.

874
00:59:51.959 --> 00:59:53.327
Wait stop. he's my brother!

875
00:59:59.566 --> 01:00:00.434
Marco!

876
01:00:15.082 --> 01:00:16.884
She didn't do anything.

877
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:17.851
She recognized me.

878
01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:20.254
She has a picture on her phone.

879
01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:23.824
She was a good woman.

880
01:00:25.192 --> 01:00:27.895
Are you fucking blind. this
bitch tried to kill me.

881
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:31.332
Is this how easily you deceived?

882
01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:34.568
Marco you need a hospital.
we need a hospital.

883
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.310
No. we need to get back to the
boat and get the money.

884
01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:44.645
We can't leave her.

885
01:00:44.678 --> 01:00:47.481
We only need one more day.
come on help me.

886
01:00:47.514 --> 01:00:48.382
Help me.

887
01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:51.085
Niko!

888
01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:52.086
Help me!

889
01:01:00.928 --> 01:01:03.497
No. wait. wait. get the phone.

890
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:04.398
Get the phone.

891
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:07.534
Wait.

892
01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.511
What are you doing?

893
01:01:17.544 --> 01:01:19.646

896
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.163
Hey Tillie. how would you
describe this shade of red?

897
01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:41.101
Call it fuck me now. deep red.

898
01:01:44.438 --> 01:01:45.572
I think you got a text.

899
01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:48.442
It might be Niko.

900
01:01:58.318 --> 01:02:02.523
Did you figure out what you're
wearing for him yet?

901
01:02:03.524 --> 01:02:04.391
Till?

902
01:02:06.193 --> 01:02:08.996
Whatever. new boy toy. I get it.

Please.

907
01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:37.725
Oh.

908
01:02:54.508 --> 01:02:55.676
You're burning up.

909
01:02:57.779 --> 01:02:59.146
It's Lou. he's a friend.

910
01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:01.682
Everything has to seem normal.

911
01:03:07.254 --> 01:03:09.022
Niko. my man.

912
01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:12.559
Tomorrow promises festivities
of epic proportions.

913
01:03:12.593 --> 01:03:14.194
And am I correct in believing

914
01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:16.363
I just witnessed you by
Island Liquors?

915
01:03:18.265 --> 01:03:20.033
I'm stocking up on booze.

916
01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:22.135
And what about the uh.

917
01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:24.104
Yes. I have what you want.

918
01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:25.405
Yes.

919
01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:26.640
You are indeed the man.

920
01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.219
You have to take the money off
the boat and hide it.

921
01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:41.088
Other martyrs will
contact you soon.

922
01:03:41.756 --> 01:03:43.290
What?

923
01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:44.124
Marco. who?

924
01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:45.192
To Nantucket?

925
01:03:45.225 --> 01:03:46.393
Yes. Nantucket.

926
01:03:46.426 --> 01:03:48.695
The timer is set to
go off 12 noon.

927
01:03:50.297 --> 01:03:51.298
You know what to do.

928
01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:04.444
Whoa. pre fourth of July
face plant already.

929
01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:12.419
A sad exhibition when a man
doesn't know his limits.

930
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:31.271
You need a doctor.

931
01:04:31.305 --> 01:04:32.040
No.

932
01:04:46.553 --> 01:04:47.822
Who are you calling?

933
01:04:47.855 --> 01:04:49.122
You should be quiet.

934
01:04:53.293 --> 01:04:54.595
Hey Tillie.

935
01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:56.129
Sorry. I missed your call.
my phone was dead.

936
01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:57.230
Is everything okay?

937
01:04:57.264 --> 01:04:59.499
I'm here at my aunts clinic.

938
01:04:59.533 --> 01:05:01.869
her bikes here. but the
clinic's closed.

939
01:05:03.637 --> 01:05:04.504
It's not right.

940
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.207
Where are you?

941
01:05:10.644 --> 01:05:12.346
I am outside Island Liquors.

942
01:05:14.749 --> 01:05:17.184
Can you meet me at the clinic?

943
01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:19.653
Okay. stay where you were. I'll
be there as soon as I can.

944
01:05:21.655 --> 01:05:22.857
Niko. no. no.

945
01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:25.692
We need to get this boat
back to the beach.

946
01:05:25.727 --> 01:05:27.661
I can't do it on my own. I
need your help.

947
01:05:27.694 --> 01:05:30.464
I understand. but I
need to go now.

948
01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:31.866
Everything I have done
till this point

949
01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:33.835
cannot be for nothing. you
understand that?

950
01:05:33.868 --> 01:05:36.136
Yes. I'll be back soon.

951
01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:41.141
Niko.

952
01:05:42.476 --> 01:05:43.343
Niko!

953
01:05:44.277 --> 01:05:45.145
Niko!

954
01:05:52.686 --> 01:05:54.956
Her bike is still here Chris.

955
01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:55.857
She probably took cab.

956
01:05:57.424 --> 01:05:59.927
Listen. we're swamped here.
I gotta go.

957
01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:09.503
Tillie.

958
01:06:10.437 --> 01:06:11.706
I'm freaking out.

959
01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:12.907
It hasn't been long. honestly.

960
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.875
and there's so many crazy things

961
01:06:13.908 --> 01:06:15.575
happening before the fourth.

962
01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:17.845
I've called. I've texted.
nothing.

963
01:06:17.879 --> 01:06:20.480
She wouldn't just leave
her bike here.

964
01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:28.255
Niko. do you know this guy?

965
01:06:36.596 --> 01:06:37.464
No.

966
01:06:41.769 --> 01:06:42.837
Sorry to bother you.

967
01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.440
I know you have to get
back to work.

968
01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:48.710
Tillie. it's no trouble.
honestly.

969
01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:50.544
You just go. it's okay.

970
01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:04.624
[Answering Machine] This is
Richard Cantrell.

971
01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:05.659
I'm not available right now.

972
01:07:05.692 --> 01:07:09.362
Please contact my partner
Agent Hanley at 555.

973
01:07:12.399 --> 01:07:14.401
Spare no peperoni good sir.

974
01:07:15.837 --> 01:07:20.440
What. have we had enough of the
tea and biscuits me Lord?

975
01:07:20.474 --> 01:07:21.909
Stuff it Henry.

976
01:07:28.082 --> 01:07:31.318
Niko. my good man.
about tomorrow.

977
01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.020
Yes. I told you. I
got you covered.

978
01:07:33.054 --> 01:07:34.521
Listen I need you to
do me a favor.

979
01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:35.857
Can you call Tillie?

980
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:37.290
Can you enlighten me please?

981
01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:41.829
A boundless fountain of
olive oil and vinegar.

982
01:07:41.863 --> 01:07:43.831
Her aunt is missing and she
needs to calm down. okay?

983
01:07:43.865 --> 01:07:45.800
I have to work tonight.

984
01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:49.003
Oh yes. aunt Jenny. a
previous source

985
01:07:49.036 --> 01:07:50.670
of numerous episodes of
disconnection.

986
01:07:52.073 --> 01:07:54.942
Related directly to the effects
of excessive alcohol.

987
01:07:56.077 --> 01:07:59.613
But no fear. I will find
her drunken soul.

988
01:07:59.646 --> 01:08:01.581
Yeah. just call her. okay.

989
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:04.551
Okay. bye.

990
01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:34.381
You okay?

991
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:40.755
Pretty good view for the
fireworks. no?

992
01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:44.926
I'm okay. don't worry about me.

993
01:08:46.127 --> 01:08:48.361
You need to take the
money and go.

994
01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:50.463
It's under there.
under the bunk.

995
01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:55.702
Father worked hard to raise that
money for our cause.

996
01:08:59.974 --> 01:09:03.343
We owe it to those who gave to
continue the war.

997
01:09:07.048 --> 01:09:08.749
Marco. you could still go away.

998
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:11.752
No.

999
01:09:11.786 --> 01:09:14.755
She's father's final glory.
you go.

1000
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:16.023
You make us proud.

1001
01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:20.027
And when it's finished
just disappear.

1002
01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:22.997
You did not know this.

1003
01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:26.700
Father was trained by
the Americans

1004
01:09:26.734 --> 01:09:29.770
to do their dirty work overseas.

1005
01:09:29.804 --> 01:09:34.008
He fought his Muslim brothers on
the promise of a visa.

1006
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.610
Better life. education for you.

1007
01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:38.846
But they betrayed him.

1008
01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:42.549
This so called nation
of immigrants.

1009
01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:46.053
they denied the visa.

1010
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:50.091
They sent our mother
back home in shame

1011
01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:52.525
where she was stoned to death.

1012
01:09:52.559 --> 01:09:54.694
I wish that you had come with me
and father to London.

1013
01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:57.098
and not America with mother.

1014
01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:57.798
But mama.

1015
01:09:57.832 --> 01:09:59.834
So tomorrow you will remind them

1016
01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:02.837
of the cost of
arrogance and greed.

1017
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:04.872
And of what it feels like to
have death come from no where.

1018
01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:07.174
Is that all you feel now Marco?

1019
01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:11.411
The need to hate and punish?

1020
01:10:13.546 --> 01:10:15.082
We're not that
different to them.

1021
01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:17.885
And mama. she loved it here.

1022
01:10:17.919 --> 01:10:18.920
She didn't go back in shame.

1023
01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:21.789
she went back to get a legal
visa to stay here.

1024
01:10:24.624 --> 01:10:26.426
If only you could
feel what I feel.

1025
01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:33.466
but I had my America. and
you never did.

1026
01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:42.977
Don't be a fool don't
listen to their lies.

1027
01:10:44.678 --> 01:10:46.981
Our course is true.

1028
01:10:47.014 --> 01:10:50.885
Your family is through your
brother. its true.

1029
01:10:53.955 --> 01:10:57.657
You're legacy to this
day and to me.

1030
01:10:57.691 --> 01:10:58.960
That is your oath.

1031
01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:04.698
You understand me little
brother. that is your oath.

1032
01:11:07.268 --> 01:11:08.668
You understand?

1033
01:11:09.904 --> 01:11:10.771
Now go.

1034
01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:15.109
Do your duty. go.

1035
01:13:23.938 --> 01:13:24.805
Chris.

1036
01:13:26.073 --> 01:13:28.641
I got back at three am. she
still wasn't home.

1037
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.345
Okay.

1038
01:13:31.378 --> 01:13:35.648
It's crazy. I can't get a hold
of anybody at the clinic.

1039
01:13:35.682 --> 01:13:37.852
No one is picking up the phone.

1040
01:13:37.885 --> 01:13:40.254
I hope she didn't fall
off the wagon.

1041
01:13:40.287 --> 01:13:43.290
Called the police. they're over
run with the beach party.

1042
01:13:43.324 --> 01:13:45.392
I don't know what else to do.

1043
01:13:45.426 --> 01:13:46.327
Thanks Chris.

1044
01:13:56.303 --> 01:13:58.671
Yeah. I just wish it
was you and I.

1045
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.175
Not into big crowds.

1046
01:14:02.977 --> 01:14:03.844
In fact when we get there

1047
01:14:03.878 --> 01:14:05.980
can we just take a walk
or something?

1048
01:14:09.049 --> 01:14:11.218
Okay.

1049
01:14:39.146 --> 01:14:40.314
Niko my man.

1050
01:14:40.347 --> 01:14:41.315
Hey.

1051
01:14:41.348 --> 01:14:43.751
Are the goods in one of
these oh so hipster.

1052
01:14:43.784 --> 01:14:44.451
Yeti cooler bags?

1053
01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:45.819
Now hold on. hold on. hold on.

1054
01:14:48.389 --> 01:14:50.257
You gotta watch out for all the
undercover cops around here.

1055
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:52.793
Don't want the party to end too
soon now. do we Lou?

1056
01:14:52.826 --> 01:14:54.395
Prudence is wise.

1057
01:14:54.428 --> 01:14:56.830
Don't you judge me. to bring
your delicate young canine

1058
01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:59.500
to a beach prime for
numerous loud explosions.

1059
01:14:59.533 --> 01:15:00.401
Not so much.

1060
01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:03.837
All right. I'll see you soon.

1061
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.242
I think Lou likes the puppy.

1062
01:15:09.243 --> 01:15:11.879
Oh my God.

1063
01:15:11.912 --> 01:15:13.314
Wait. who is this?

1064
01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:17.284
Precious little thing.

1065
01:15:19.787 --> 01:15:21.121
She's a present from Niko.

1066
01:15:23.824 --> 01:15:24.491
Hi.

1067
01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:29.129
Whoa. and I thought my outfit
would get attention.

1068
01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:31.932
This is gonna be ridiculous.

1069
01:15:31.966 --> 01:15:33.300
I'm gonna get something
out of the truck.

1070
01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:34.201
Okay.

1071
01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:39.473
What have we got here.

1072
01:15:39.506 --> 01:15:40.374
A puppy.

1073
01:15:40.407 --> 01:15:41.809
Can I pet him.

1074
01:15:41.842 --> 01:15:42.876
Him is a her.

1075
01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:45.212
She's almost as
beautiful as you.

1076
01:15:45.246 --> 01:15:46.947
Aw. you're charming.

1077
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:47.815
I try.

1078
01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:01.095
So Niko. can you
confirm who owns

1079
01:16:01.128 --> 01:16:02.263
that glorious yacht off shore

1080
01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:04.999
and explain why your dear
friends have been denied access?

1081
01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:05.899
Just a second Lou.

1082
01:16:05.933 --> 01:16:06.800
What yacht?

1083
01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:09.803
The same yacht I saw your
Romeo escorting

1084
01:16:09.837 --> 01:16:10.838
another fellow
aboard last night.

1085
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:12.273
You saw Niko there?

1086
01:16:13.874 --> 01:16:16.410
Entwined with a gentleman and
instinctively navigating

1087
01:16:16.443 --> 01:16:18.312
his way aboard as if
returning home.

1088
01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:22.182
I'm going for a swim.

1089
01:16:24.285 --> 01:16:26.153
Tell Felicity to watch
the puppy. okay?

1090
01:16:26.186 --> 01:16:29.857
Shouldn't be a problem. hey.
hey that's my board!

1091
01:16:49.476 --> 01:16:52.379
Has the hour arrived to spark up
some fine central Oregon?

1092
01:16:52.413 --> 01:16:53.981
Where's Tillie?

1093
01:16:54.014 --> 01:16:55.949
Oh our dear flower
impulsively decided

1094
01:16:55.983 --> 01:16:58.385
to paddle toward your well
endowed friends boat.

1095
01:16:58.419 --> 01:17:00.220
Perhaps planning an
offshore rendezvous.

1096
01:17:01.255 --> 01:17:02.122
No. no.

1097
01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:54.675
Tillie!

1098
01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:06.387
Tillie!

1099
01:18:09.456 --> 01:18:11.925
It's your friend isn't it?

1100
01:18:14.328 --> 01:18:15.262
You lied to me!

1101
01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:17.998
No. it's my brother.

1102
01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:18.999
Your brother?

1103
01:18:23.237 --> 01:18:24.304
Your brother?

1104
01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:26.540
Did he kill my parents?

1105
01:18:26.573 --> 01:18:27.408
I don't know.

1106
01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:32.279
Where's aunt Jenny?

1107
01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:34.148
Marco was hurt.

1108
01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:37.351
I took him to your aunt.

1109
01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:40.120
She was trying to help. I didn't
know what he would do.

1110
01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:41.155
Oh my God.

1111
01:18:42.156 --> 01:18:42.990
Oh my God.

1112
01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:44.224
Tillie. Tillie.

1113
01:18:46.728 --> 01:18:47.594
Marco.

1114
01:18:50.732 --> 01:18:51.598
Wait.

1115
01:18:54.769 --> 01:18:56.470
Please Tillie. you shouldn't be.
you shouldn't be here.

1116
01:18:56.503 --> 01:18:58.105
Why. why my parents?

1117
01:18:58.138 --> 01:19:00.274
What did we ever do to you?

1118
01:19:00.307 --> 01:19:02.376
When else were you and
your brother doing?

1119
01:19:05.512 --> 01:19:07.614
I had a family to. Marco
was all I had left.

1120
01:19:07.648 --> 01:19:09.049
Aunt Jenny was all I had left.

1121
01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:13.086
You made me believe like I was
getting my life back.

1122
01:19:14.789 --> 01:19:16.390
Stupid. stupid me!

1123
01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:20.194
What else were you doing?

1124
01:19:22.563 --> 01:19:25.265
Marco put bombs in the cooler
bags on the truck.

1125
01:19:25.299 --> 01:19:26.667
No Tillie wait. wait.
Tillie wait.

1126
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.368
just let me explain Tillie.

1127
01:19:30.604 --> 01:19:31.438
But.

1128
01:19:32.473 --> 01:19:34.408
Tillie. Tillie. Tillie.

1129
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:04.238
Niko!

1130
01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:39.566
There's a bomb. there's a bomb!

1131
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.869
A bomb. move. there's a bomb!

1132
01:21:41.903 --> 01:21:45.205
No bomb. look. just champaign
and a little weed.

1133
01:21:45.238 --> 01:21:47.641
Listen. ow officer. come on!

1134
01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:49.777
He's right. he's right. no bomb.

1135
01:21:49.811 --> 01:21:51.478
Just a cooler full of champaign.

1136
01:21:54.448 --> 01:21:56.316
Tillie. I'm Agent Hanley.

1137
01:21:58.853 --> 01:21:59.887
We found your aunt.

1138
01:21:59.921 --> 01:22:04.424
I'm so sorry. thank God you're
here in one piece.

1139
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:06.259
Now we got here as
fast as we could.

1140
01:22:06.293 --> 01:22:07.294
Where's the suspect?

1141
01:22:09.964 --> 01:22:11.131
Dead on the boat.

1142
01:22:11.966 --> 01:22:13.200
And your boyfriend?

1143
01:22:15.937 --> 01:22:17.237
Bottom of the sea.

1144
01:22:20.942 --> 01:22:24.746
Your godfather. my partner.
Agent Cantrell?

1145
01:22:24.779 --> 01:22:27.614
We got an anonymous call to 911
with his location.

1146
01:22:28.783 --> 01:22:32.686
We found him at the marina
on a small boat.

1147
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.822
He's in critical condition
at Mass General.

1148
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.691
He just might make it.

1149
01:22:41.829 --> 01:22:43.363
I'm sorry. excuse me.

1150
01:22:45.332 --> 01:22:46.199
Sarge.

1151
01:22:47.567 --> 01:22:49.436
All right. what have we got?

1152
01:22:49.469 --> 01:22:51.939
Well both coolers are just
filled with champaign and ice.

1153
01:22:51.973 --> 01:22:54.441
Nothing consistent with an IED.
we're all clear.

1154
01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:56.276
All right.

1155
01:23:01.648 --> 01:23:03.517
Let's leave the truck.

1156
01:23:36.884 --> 01:23:37.785
I'm sorry.

1157
01:24:05.479 --> 01:24:06.814
Holy shit.

1158
01:24:48.588 --> 01:24:50.690
Dear Tillie. I'm sorry

1159
01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:52.659
I'm not gonna be with
you for a while.

1160
01:24:54.461 --> 01:24:55.863
I know I've made some mistakes.

1161
01:24:56.931 --> 01:24:58.665
and I'm prepared to
pay the price.

1162
01:25:00.467 --> 01:25:01.769
I hope the explosion
was far enough

1163
01:25:01.803 --> 01:25:03.470
away that nobody was hurt.

1164
01:25:03.503 --> 01:25:06.808
I took the FBI agent to the
marina and called 911.

1165
01:25:06.841 --> 01:25:07.775
I hope he's okay.

1166
01:25:08.976 --> 01:25:11.511
I'm so sorry about aunt Jenny.

1167
01:25:11.545 --> 01:25:14.581
She was so kind and I
felt safe with her.

1168
01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:17.752
Marco is my brother but I
didn't see it coming.

1169
01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.087
She was such a good woman.

1170
01:25:21.488 --> 01:25:23.791
I hope you can find
someway to forgive me.

1171
01:25:23.825 --> 01:25:24.624
I'll work hard.

1172
01:25:25.827 --> 01:25:28.963
I've decided to take your advice
and major in architecture.

1173
01:25:28.996 --> 01:25:32.465
It was always my dream to become
an American citizen.

1174
01:25:32.499 --> 01:25:34.501
It'll probably stay a
dream considering.

1175
01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:38.806
My father wanted us to use
this money for war

1176
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.708
but we can use it for good.

1177
01:25:40.741 --> 01:25:43.110
I know that's what my mother
would have wanted.

1178
01:25:43.144 --> 01:25:47.915
But I love you Tillie and
I'm loyal to you

1179
01:25:47.949 --> 01:25:50.918
and only you for the rest of our
lives we'll spend together.

1180
01:25:54.088 --> 01:25:55.589
I love you Tillie.
