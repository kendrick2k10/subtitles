00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:58.458
I was working a different desk.
You know when they'll be back?

174
00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.125
No clue. They're up to their eyeballs.

175
00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.292
Yeah. I bet. Any suspects?

176
00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:05.208
Talk to Corsetti. He already covered it.

177
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.583
I'm doing a different story
about how the murders are connected.

178
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:09.875
You mean the bows?

179
00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:13.000
All three had bows around their necks?

180
00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:14.625
I didn't say that.

181
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:17.875
No. I already confirmed Ida Irga.
Are you confirming Blake and Slesers?

182
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:20.958
I'm not confirmin' nothin'.
Why don't you take a hike?

183
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.458
[Loretta]
Only one I can confirm is Ida Irga.

184
00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:28.125
What about the autopsy reports?

185
00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.792
DA won't release them.

186
00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:31.250
Wasn't one of them in Lynn?

187
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.417
Helen Blake.

188
00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:35.250
Well. that's Essex County.
Different county. different DA.

189
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.875
Corsetti.
you know the medical examiner in Lynn?

190
00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.333
[Corsetti] Yeah. I play cards with him.

191
00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.333
See if you can get
the Helen Blake autopsy.

192
00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:52.667
[Loretta] Thanks.

193
00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.458
Okay. [sighs]

194
00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:35.417
[sighs]

195
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:43.542
[sighs]

196
00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:00.042
[phone ringing]

197
00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:07.250
[officer 1] What's the one right next to...
[laughs]

198
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.333
Excuse me. I'm looking for Officer Dougan.

199
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.708
[officer 2] Dougan? No. he's not here.

200
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:13.792
You know where he drinks?

201
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.583
You know where Foley's is?

202
00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:16.667
[door creaks]

203
00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:23.917
Officer Dougan?

204
00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:26.708
Yeah.

205
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:29.625
Uh. Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

206
00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:32.625
Uh. you took the call for Anna Slesers?

207
00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.417
[Dougan] That's right.

208
00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:36.375
I need to ask you a detail
about the crime scene.

209
00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:38.875
I don't think I'm supposed
to be talking to the papers.

210
00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:40.375
No. it's nothing like that.

211
00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:44.667
Uh-- Just wanna ask
about the stockings around her neck.

212
00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.750
Did you see if they were tied
in a single or a double-hitched knot?

213
00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:50.542
There's no way I could tell by looking.

214
00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:53.375
I would've had to roll her over. and--
I'm just a patrolman.

215
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.750
I don't touch the bodies.

216
00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.333
Did it look decorative?

217
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.208
In a real sick kind of way. yeah.

218
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
Thank you.

219
00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:14.042
I just confirmed Slesers.
I've got confirmation on all three.

220
00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:16.292
[Jack]
<i>All right. Get back here and write it up.</i>

221
00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:22.750
[Loretta]
<i>What do these three women have in common?</i>

222
00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:26.125
<i>Three shadowy patterns of attack.</i>

223
00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:29.542
<i>Three knotted loops
that bind them together.</i>

224
00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:34.333
<i>Strangers to one another
in life. they became sisters in death.</i>

225
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:39.583
<i>Each coming to the same horror-filled
moment of murder by strangulation</i>

226
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:44.542
<i>by a killer who came quietly.
who is careful in his derangement.</i>

227
00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:47.917
<i>and self-possessed enough
to lock the door on his way out.</i>

228
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:50.417
- [knocking]
- [neighbor] Hey. you okay in there?

229
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.750
Open up! Hey. if you don't open the door.
I'm gonna call the cops!

230
00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:08.750
- Nice work. kid.
- [Loretta chuckles]

today after a story in the</i> Record American

<i>claims that three elderly women were

234
00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:21.750
There's nothing in the <i>Globe</i>

Or any of 'em.

236

You beat the whole damn city.

237
00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:31.917
I can't believe it. This is incredible!

238
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.917
The story's bullshit.

239
00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:39.833
Been getting calls all morning
from my guys in the department.

240
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:42.125
- [buzzer sounds]
- [Phyllis] <i>DA's office for you.</i>

241
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:43.833
Hold my calls. please.

242
00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:45.417
[Corsetti] She's in way over her head.

243
00:15:45.417 --> 00:15:47.708
- You never should've sent her out on this.
- [buzzer sounds]

244
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.833
[Phyllis]
<i>I have Commissioner McNamara for you.</i>

245
00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.542
I told you to hold my calls.

246
00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:54.125
<i>No. he's here for you.</i>

247
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.250
Jesus Christ.

248
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.833
Fuck 'em.

249
00:15:58.708 --> 00:15:59.875
Send him in.

250
00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:01.208
[drink pours]

251
00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.542
Ah. what can I do for you. Commissioner?

252
00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:12.375
Was it your idea to send some skirt
down to the station house?

253
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:14.958
Well. her name's Loretta.
She was workin' a story.

254
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.792
Is that what you're callin' it now?

255
00:16:17.917 --> 00:16:20.583
Hanging around the bar.
flirtin' with my guys?

256
00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:23.417
Never even identified herself
as a reporter.

257
00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:27.708
Now I've got every old lady in
the fuckin' city tying up my phone lines!

258
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:30.458
Just tell me what we got wrong.
and I'll print a correction.

259
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.458
It's barstool gossip. for Christ's sake!

260
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:35.333
Half the news in the city's
barstool gossip.

261
00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:36.833
What the hell did we get wrong?

262
00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:40.167
Homicide has been workin'
around the clock on this.

263
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.167
and we've got nothin'
to connect the murders.

264
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.833
What about the stockings?

265
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.625
Only one of the victims in Boston
had that.

266
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.125
The other one looks like a suicide.

267
00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:50.125
- We got sources for both women--
- Sources!

268
00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:54.708
It was a couple of dipshit beat cops
trying to bed that girl you sent down!

269
00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:58.250
I'm telling you this as a friend.

270
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.833
If you keep running this story.
you're gonna end up embarrassing yourself.

- [chattering]
- [phone ringing]

272
00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:10.958
[Jack] Loretta!

273
00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.250
Shut the door.

274
00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:32.667
I am catching hell over this story.

275
00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:35.125
Now. Commissioner McNamara
says the whole thing's gossip.

276
00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:36.458
Same with Corsetti's sources.

277
00:17:36.458 --> 00:17:38.500
I confirmed every word of that story.

278
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.375
You identified yourself as a reporter?

279
00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:41.708
Of course I did.

280
00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:44.083
- Even at the bar?
- Especially at the bar.

281
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.833
I'm killin' the follow-up.

282
00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:52.458
We beat everyone in the whole damn city.
and you're-- you're just gonna drop it?

283
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:53.583
Yes. I am.

284
00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:55.125
The story is good.

285
00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:57.125
The story is a headache
I don't need right now.

286
00:17:58.042 --> 00:18:00.292
And you're back on the lifestyle desk.

287
00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:26.417
[Kelly]
She shouldn't be working like this.

288
00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:28.042
[Loretta's husband] Oh. come on. Kelly.

289
00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:30.125
[Kelly] She should be home
taking care of her own husband.

290
00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:31.958
[Loretta's husband]
You check in a few hours a day.

291
00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.583
It's not the worst thing in the world.

292
00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:35.667
[Kelly speaking. indistinct]

293
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:39.000
[Kelly] You don't see how selfish it is?

294
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.208
[Loretta's husband] What do you
want me to say? We make it work.

295
00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:43.042
[Kelly] Yeah. 'cause I watch your kids
half the week.

296
00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:44.625
[Loretta's husband]
I appreciate your help--

297
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.542
[Kelly] She's going to ruin your children.

298
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:49.708
Hi. Kelly.

299
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:51.917
Hi. Loretta.

300
00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:54.417
He offer you anything? Coffee? Tea?

301
00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:56.167
I was just headin' out.

302
00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:00.333
Tommy had a meltdown in the car.
Gave Patrick a fat lip.

303
00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:04.000
Class pictures are tomorrow.
Might wanna ice it again.

304
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:07.208
Thank you.

305
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:08.417

[melancholic singing on the radio]

308
00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:37.292
So. why haven't you asked me to stay home?

309
00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:39.917
'Cause I know better.

310
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.917
No. I'm serious. Why not?

311
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:44.000
'Cause you'd be miserable.

312
00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.500
Well. so what?

313
00:19:47.292 --> 00:19:51.083
Our lives would be easier.
Kids would be better off.

314
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.333
- Says who?
- Your sister.

315
00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.625
My mother. The neighbor.

316
00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:57.958
What the hell do they know?

317
00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:02.083
You'd drive us all mad
if you were sittin' around here all day.

318
00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:03.167
[chuckles]

319
00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:06.750
It was a great story.

320
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:13.458
Jack's probably just afraid to rock
the boat. Don't take it personally.

Yeah. I got a call about a water leak.

<i>Loretta. it's Phyllis.</i>

343
00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:28.833
Another woman was strangled.
Just came over the wire.

344
00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:31.083
- Thank you.
- Who was that?

345
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:33.667
- They just found a fourth victim.
- Go.

346
00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:35.583
- You'll get the kids off to school?
- Yeah. yeah. Go.

347
00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:36.875
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

348
00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:39.583
- Dad's taking you to school today. okay?
- Dad's taking us?

349
00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:41.583

- [child] Where are you going?

350
00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:45.083

00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:46.750
[ringing continues]

352
00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.375
- I saw that.
- Wasn't hiding it.

353
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:53.667
Maybe you should.

354
00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:54.750
Hello?

355
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.583

I need you on the Strangler story.</i>

357
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:00.208
That bad. huh?

358
00:23:00.208 --> 00:23:01.958

the nursing home story tonight?</i>

359
00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.250
- [Jean] Yeah. all right.

360
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.333
What was that about?

361
00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:08.167
[sighs] Holland wants me
on those Strangler murders.

362
00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:09.833
[Jean's husband]
The hell's the matter with him?

363
00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:11.000
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.333
He's using you. Putting a girl
on a story like that. It's a stunt.

365
00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:17.667
I need you to get the girls off.

366
00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:19.000
[children chattering]

367
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:21.625
Here. take a seat.

368
00:23:25.542 --> 00:23:28.708
Jean's gonna be working with you
on the Strangler story.

369
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:32.125
Oh. uh. no offense.
but I-I don't need any help with this.

370
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:33.333
It's not up for debate.

371
00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:35.042
[Loretta]
What is she gonna cover that I can't?

372
00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:37.000
The whole story. if you keep it up.

373
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.542
[smacks lips]
Where are you at with the fourth victim?

374
00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:41.292
She have a stocking around the neck?

375
00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:43.708
Uh. I haven't got confirmation yet.

376
00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:46.625
Not yet? It's 40 minutes to deadline.

377
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.083
Police won't confirm.

378
00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:50.458
Her cousin Arnold found the body.
but there's. uh--

379
00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:52.333
There's no listings
for an Arnold Sullivan.

380
00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.958
and no other relatives have come forward.

381
00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:55.917
[editor] Jeanie. call around.
See what you come up with.

382
00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:59.250
[Jean] I already did.
Police aren't talking. Corsetti tried too.

383
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.125
Never seen 'em this tight-lipped
about anything.

384
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:03.542
[Jack] That's 'cause they're bracing
for a shitstorm.

385
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.625

Otherwise. pull it from page one.

I'm calling everyone in the phone book

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:23.958
"Every day is an eternity.
every night a horror.

506
00:30:24.667 --> 00:30:27.000
Nobody knows what a woman alone feels."

507
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.042
"No one knows fear as we know it."

[Loretta] <i>There is but one answer.
The Boston Phantom...</i>

509

<i>The Boston Strangler must be caught.</i>

510
00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:46.792
Guess he's got a name now.

511
00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:51.917
Shit.

512
00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:53.500
- [chattering]
- [chuckles]

513
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.208
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

514
00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:02.250
So. uh. how'd you become Holland's girl?
He poach you from one of the other papers?

515
00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:05.125
He got me a job
when I graduated high school.

516
00:31:06.042 --> 00:31:08.792
I was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse.

517
00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:11.708
He covered a trial
the summer before my senior year.

518
00:31:12.417 --> 00:31:16.417
I got to know him pretty well. and so he
offered to get me a job when I turned 18.

519
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:20.458
Back then. just living through the day
was an accomplishment.

520
00:31:22.042 --> 00:31:25.125
I wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments.

521
00:31:25.125 --> 00:31:26.917
I didn't have money for anything else.

522
00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:29.458
Holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit.

523
00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:32.000
I never wanted to let him down after that.

524
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:33.792
I learned to hold my own.

525
00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:36.792
and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories.

526
00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:38.708
and it just became my life.

527
00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:41.750
I really can't imagine
doing anything else.

528
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:47.208
It's crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter.

529
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.208
My senior year. I. uh--
I lined up with all the other girls

530
00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.708
to register for nursing school.

531
00:31:53.542 --> 00:31:56.458
But my English teacher. Mrs. Welker.
she-- she pulled me out of the line

532
00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:59.708
and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college.

533
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And that was it.

534
00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:05.042
I'd be changing bedpans
if it wasn't for her.

535
00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:06.708
Thank God for Mrs. Welker.

Oh. [sighs]
Another woman turned up. I've gotta go in.

545
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:44.542
You gotta be kidding me.
It's New Year's Eve for Christ's sakes.

546
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.167
Who's gonna take your mother home?

547
00:32:48.167 --> 00:32:50.333
[stammers] I can take her now. I guess.

548
00:32:55.292 --> 00:32:57.542

[resident]
That guy came to my door earlier today.

559
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:05.542
He said he was here
to paint the apartment. so I let him in.

560
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:11.542
All of a sudden. he tells me I'm pretty
and asks me if I thought about modeling.

561
00:34:13.042 --> 00:34:15.667
I got nervous.
told him my husband was home.

562
00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:19.375
I pretended to go back and get him.
and when I came back. he was gone.

563
00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:21.042
What time was this?

564
00:34:21.542 --> 00:34:23.958
Uh. this afternoon. Three o'clock.

565
00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:26.667
Could you describe him for me?

566
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.917
Uh. normal. White guy. dark hair.

567
00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:34.458
He had workman's clothes on.

568
00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:37.708
He just looked regular.

Off the record.

609

were having an affair.

679
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.625
Everyone in the office knew.

680
00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:26.958
Did he know she was pregnant?

681
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:29.792
He was helping her sort it out.

682
00:41:29.792 --> 00:41:31.708
Sort it out? How?

683
00:41:32.375 --> 00:41:34.417
[receptionist] He found a convent
in New Hampshire.

684
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.083
They were supposed to arrange
for an adoption.

685
00:41:37.917 --> 00:41:39.917
Do you know if Patricia
wanted to keep the baby?

686
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:42.833
Maybe.

687
00:41:44.292 --> 00:41:46.375
But Mr. Nielson has a wife and kids.

688
00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:50.000
So that was that.

689
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.083
[parent] Beverly came over every week
no matter what.

690
00:41:58.333 --> 00:42:01.667
She'd bring supper and we'd watch
the stories on the TV together.

691
00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:04.917
Do you know if she had a boyfriend?

692
00:42:05.708 --> 00:42:09.375
I don't think so.
School took up most of her time.

693
00:42:10.125 --> 00:42:13.542
And the choir.
It's where a lot of her friends were from.

694
00:42:14.292 --> 00:42:15.292
At church?

695
00:42:15.292 --> 00:42:18.542
[parent] No.
At BU. where she was studying.

696
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.000
Oh. That's where I went.

697
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:24.375
[scoffs]

698
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.750
I always thought she'd end up
being someone like you.

699
00:42:27.625 --> 00:42:31.333
You know. with a job she loved.
living on her own terms.

700
00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.500
I admired that about her.

701
00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:39.875
She was doin' all the things I wish
I could've done with my own life.

702
00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:43.875
You have kids?

703
00:42:43.875 --> 00:42:45.542
Yeah. Uh. three.

704
00:42:46.792 --> 00:42:50.458
Maggie's nine.
The boys are seven and five.

705
00:42:51.958 --> 00:42:55.417
[parent] Beverly was terrified of the dark
when she was that age.

706
00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:58.583
Only way I could get her to calm down
was by singing to her.

707
00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:00.542
[sobs]

708
00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:05.625
I'm sorry. I just--
I just can't stop thinking about it.

709
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:11.208
What he did to her.
What that must have been like for her.

710
00:43:12.292 --> 00:43:15.417
[sobbing]

711
00:43:15.417 --> 00:43:18.667
[choir vocalizing]

712
00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:47.500
[friend] Beverly had just broken up
with her boyfriend.

713
00:43:49.625 --> 00:43:52.417
She was taking advantage of her freedom.

714
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:56.125
Did you meet any of the guys
she was seeing?

715
00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:58.792
Yeah. but they were all harmless.

716
00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:03.625
It's her ex that she was afraid of.

717
00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:08.667
Uh-- Sorry. who is that?

718
00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:13.125
Daniel Marsh.

719
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:15.583
Why was she afraid of him?

720
00:44:16.292 --> 00:44:17.958
He was harassing her.

721
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.833
He had just gotten kicked out of Harvard.
was acting really erratic.

722
00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:29.292
He'd call in the middle of the night.
show up unannounced. Things like that.

723
00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:32.417
And when was this?

724
00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:35.542
Right up until around when it happened.

725
00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:08.667
[doorbell buzzes]

726
00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:20.875
Daniel Marsh?

727
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.333
Yes?

728
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:24.750
Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

729
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.542
You knew Beverly Samans?

730
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:29.458
Come inside.

Come in. Come in.

733
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.750
It's just back here.

[machine rattling]

735
00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:02.375
We can talk just back here.

736
00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:11.583
Uh. I've just remembered that I've got.
uh. another appointment.

737
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:15.042
I'm gonna have to--
I'm gonna have to come back another time.

744
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.667
You okay?

745
00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:42.750
Yeah.

746
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.417
Don't stay here all night.

747
00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:46.708
I'm serious.

748
00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:48.667
I won't.

[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

750
00:46:58.542 --> 00:47:00.458
Wait. what did you say his name was?

751
00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:04.958
No. you called me.

752
00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:09.875
- Runnin' a hotline for the mentally unfit.
- [Loretta chuckles]

753
00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:11.333
That's everything.

754
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:15.083
All right. Give me some time. I gotta
wade through this pile of shit first.

755
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:17.083
Don't wait on these.

756
00:47:18.292 --> 00:47:19.292
They're good leads.

- [detective] Boston Police Department!
- [gasps]

761
00:48:01.458 --> 00:48:02.458
Gordon Nielson?

762
00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:04.208
- [Nielson] Yes.
- [detective] Hands on the wall.

763
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.375
[examiner] Your name is Gordon Nielson?

764
00:48:08.375 --> 00:48:09.458
[Nielson] Yes.

765
00:48:11.208 --> 00:48:12.917
[examiner] You've been divorced once?

766
00:48:13.792 --> 00:48:15.125
[Nielson] Yes.

767
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:17.667
[examiner] Patricia Bissette worked
as your secretary?

768
00:48:17.667 --> 00:48:18.750
[Nielson] Yes.

769
00:48:21.208 --> 00:48:23.792
[examiner] Did you have a relationship
with her outside of work?

770
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.333
Yes.

771
00:48:26.833 --> 00:48:29.083
[examiner] Did you see Patricia
the night she was murdered?

772
00:48:30.042 --> 00:48:31.042
No.

773
00:48:45.042 --> 00:48:46.625
Can I have an update. Detective?

774
00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:51.500
We caught Nielson removing evidence
from Patricia's apartment.

775
00:48:52.542 --> 00:48:53.917
He failed two polygraph tests.

776
00:48:53.917 --> 00:48:56.083
but the DA still doesn't think
he has a case.

777
00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:57.958
and there's nothing tying him
to the other murders.

778
00:48:57.958 --> 00:48:59.417
So. what about Daniel Marsh?

779
00:48:59.417 --> 00:49:00.917
Who? The Harvard psycho?

780
00:49:01.542 --> 00:49:04.292
He's batshit crazy. I'll give you that.
but we got nothin' on him.

781
00:49:04.292 --> 00:49:06.542
Well. he was harassing Beverly
the week before she was killed.

782
00:49:06.542 --> 00:49:08.625
Uh. you can't charge a guy
for getting high

783
00:49:08.625 --> 00:49:10.667
and calling his ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night.

784
00:49:10.667 --> 00:49:11.625
What. so that's it?

785
00:49:11.625 --> 00:49:15.125
I-I don't think you understand
what I'm dealin' with here.

786
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.250
I'm gettin' a hundred tips a day.

787
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.458
I got thousands of sex offenders
to screen.

788
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:24.542
and now the commissioner just ordered
a raid on every gay bar in the city.

789
00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:29.417
I'm doing all I can.
but I'm not playing with a full deck.

790
00:49:30.042 --> 00:49:31.333
I'll see ya later.

791
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:32.333
[car door opens]

792
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:34.833
How many gay bars in Boston
are there anyway?

793
00:49:34.833 --> 00:49:35.958
There can't be that many.

794
00:49:35.958 --> 00:49:37.125
Way to miss the point. Jack.

795
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:40.250
The point is Commissioner McNamara's
not up to the job.

796
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:41.792
What does that mean. exactly?

797
00:49:41.792 --> 00:49:43.083
His head's shoved up his ass.

798
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:45.125
They won't coordinate
with other police departments.

799
00:49:45.125 --> 00:49:46.250
connections are being missed.

800
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.125
and good leads
are falling through the cracks.

801
00:49:48.125 --> 00:49:49.542
Isn't some of that to be expected?

802
00:49:49.542 --> 00:49:51.125
[Loretta] We are way beyond that.

803
00:49:51.125 --> 00:49:52.917
Oh. I'm sorry. Jack. am I keeping you up?

804
00:49:52.917 --> 00:49:55.000
Will you cut the shit already?
What's the story?

805
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.333
- The city can't protect its women.
- Come on.

806
00:49:57.333 --> 00:49:59.750
What? You don't think it's true.
or you don't think it's a story?

807
00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:00.917
[Jack] What is it with you?

808
00:50:00.917 --> 00:50:04.125
You can't go after someone's livelihood
because you're impatient.

809
00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:06.458
Ten women are dead.
and these assholes don't have a clue!

810
00:50:06.458 --> 00:50:09.542
You don't have a story. You have a grudge.

811
00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:12.167
How many women have to die
before it's a story?

812
00:50:12.167 --> 00:50:13.250
That's enough.

813
00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:15.917
These are good men busting their asses.

814
00:50:15.917 --> 00:50:18.292
I'm not waging a war
on the police department.

I'm not gonna make a mess.

821
00:50:56.792 --> 00:50:59.458
Sit down. I gotta talk to you anyway.

in the Connecticut office part-time.

828
00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:28.750

829

Couple weeks.

830
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:32.458
And when were you gonna tell me about it?

831
00:51:32.458 --> 00:51:36.708
A lot of long days lately.
Hasn't exactly been a good time.

832

How are we supposed to manage
with you gone half the week?

You're gonna have to do your share.

834
00:51:41.333 --> 00:51:44.917
What more could I possibly do
short of quit my job?

835
00:51:44.917 --> 00:51:47.250
Is this your way of telling me
to stay home? Is that what this is?

836
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.125
Come on.
Have I ever asked you to stay home?

837
00:51:49.125 --> 00:51:51.125
No. you just do
something like this instead.

838
00:51:51.125 --> 00:51:54.000
What. I'm free to do what I want as long
as it's on your terms. isn't that right?

Loretta.

851
00:52:30.958 --> 00:52:34.458
My name's Detective Linski. I'm with
the New York City Police Department.

852
00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:38.000
I'm calling about a murder we had
down here couple of weeks ago.

853
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.333
Looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings.

854
00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:42.833
Older lady.

855
00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:45.292
Yeah. she turned up dead in a hotel room.

856
00:52:45.292 --> 00:52:48.042
strangled with stockings
tied around her neck.

857
00:52:48.042 --> 00:52:50.458
People from the hotel
saw the guy she was with.

858
00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:54.208
Couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar. so I pick him up...

859
00:52:54.208 --> 00:52:56.958
[scoffs] ...find her cigarette case
still in his pocket.

860
00:52:57.792 --> 00:53:00.208
<i>Only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession.</i>

861
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:03.500
<i>His name is Paul Dempsey.</i>

862
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.375
<i>Lives up in Maine.
but I can place him in Boston</i>

863
00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:08.458
<i>at the time of the first five murders.</i>

864
00:53:09.292 --> 00:53:11.625
Uh. I'm assuming
you went to Boston Homicide with this?

865
00:53:11.625 --> 00:53:15.042
First call I made.
Couldn't get anyone to call me back.

866
00:53:15.042 --> 00:53:18.250
<i>Couple of weeks go by.
so I make the trip up there myself.</i>

867
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.333
<i>Figure I'll just tell 'em in person.</i>

868
00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:24.208
Couldn't get anyone to meet with me.
Can you believe that?

869
00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:28.417
Detective drove four hours
for a homicide I'm working.

870
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:31.167
I'd walk out of my kid's christening
for that.

871
00:53:31.917 --> 00:53:33.667
I don't know what the hell
they're doin' up there.

872
00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:36.833
Turns out Paul Dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in Maine

873
00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:39.083
four years
before the first Strangler murder.

874
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.125
The victim was an elderly woman
found strangled

875
00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:42.708
with her stockings tied around her neck.

876
00:53:42.708 --> 00:53:44.375
It could be the original Strangler murder.

877
00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.708
but no one can get Boston Homicide
to look into it.

878
00:53:46.708 --> 00:53:48.500
And this cop in New York
will go on the record?

879
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.958
Already did.

880
00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:51.833
We're not running a hit job
on the police department.

881
00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:54.833
They're blowing the investigation.
How long can we keep ignoring it?

882
00:53:54.833 --> 00:53:58.042
I don't know how many times we have
to tell you. but we're not doing it.

883
00:53:58.708 --> 00:54:00.125
I don't know. Eddie.

884
00:54:02.292 --> 00:54:04.708
I mean. she's right.
We can't keep looking the other way.

885
00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:08.083
You really wanna use this paper
to tear down the police department?

886
00:54:08.083 --> 00:54:10.208
If anyone else was blowing it this badly.

887
00:54:10.208 --> 00:54:12.708
we'd have put it on the front page
a long time ago.

888
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:14.875
All right.

889
00:54:15.958 --> 00:54:18.500
You want to run with this?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

890
00:54:19.042 --> 00:54:21.625
But it's your neck on the block.
You understand?

any information with us.

he's one of their prime suspects.

in so he could take their measurements.

to paint the apartment.

The Green Man slipped
into the Measuring Man. It's DeSalvo.

1018
01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:28.958
[chattering]

1019
01:03:28.958 --> 01:03:30.042
[host] Right this way.

1020
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.833
I can't be caught dead
talking to you right now.

1021
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:38.917
- That bad. huh?
- No. I'm serious.

1022
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:43.000
If you gotta call me at the station.
you say you're my sister Sally. all right?

1023
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.667
What do you have for me?

1024
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.042
- It's not him.
- Well. it has to be him. Look--

1025
01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:02.000
I mean. Sophie's neighbor said
he came to paint the apartment.

1026
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.667
but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling.

1027
01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:07.792
I mean. those are the two cons
DeSalvo is famous for.

1028
01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:11.875
I worked DeSalvo for weeks.
I loved him for it. It's not him.

1029
01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:13.792
What makes you so sure?

1030
01:04:13.792 --> 01:04:16.042
He was in prison
for the first six murders.

1031
01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:18.125
didn't get out
until after Sophie was killed.

1032
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.500
Whoever was in that lady's apartment
wasn't DeSalvo.

1033
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
[sighs]

1034
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
What you're feeling right now.
that's every day for me.

1035
01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:32.500
You know how many people
I've gone down the rabbit hole with?

1036
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.750
It's a dead-end every time with this case.

1037
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.458
You get your teeth into something

1038
01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:39.833
and then your bottom falls out at three
in the morning. and you got nothin'.

1039
01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:43.917
And while I'm making myself crazy...

1040
01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.417
he's out there somewhere...

1041
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.250
laughing at us.

1042
01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.042
[thunderclap]

1043
01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:01.125
[rain pattering]

1044
01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:09.708
[sighs]

1045
01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.667
[rain continues]

1046
01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:32.125
[chattering]

1047
01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:41.042
You still stuck on DeSalvo?

1048
01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:43.292
Everything lines up with him.

1049
01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:45.625
His history.
the progression of the crimes. everything.

1050
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:48.708
[Jean] Except for the part where he was
in prison for the first six murders.

1051
01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.583
Have you seen the actual release records?

1052
01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.708
[sighs]

1053
01:06:26.542 --> 01:06:27.625
[sighs]

1054
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.292
[sighs]

1055
01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:43.625
Look at this.

1056
01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:50.542
Oh. my God.

1057
01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:53.125
DeSalvo petitioned the judge
for early release.

1058
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:55.208
He said he had to get back
to his wife and kids.

1059
01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:57.792
The judge let him out for good behavior.

1060
01:06:57.792 --> 01:06:59.667
So. he was out in time?

1061
01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:01.417
Two months before the first murder.

1062
01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:09.542
<i>A 33-year-old father of two
is considered a prime suspect</i>

1063
01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.625
<i>in the Boston Strangler case.</i>

1064
01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.625
<i>The suspect is presently confined
in a state mental hospital</i>

1065
01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:17.667
<i>for allegedly assaulting a woman
last December.</i>

1066
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
We got beat.

1067
01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:28.333
[Loretta] Who the hell is F. Lee Bailey?

1068
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:31.542
A hotshot defense lawyer.
One of those press hounds.

1069
01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:34.083
How the hell did DeSalvo
get a hotshot lawyer?

1070
01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:37.167
I don't know.
You want me to go do your job for ya?

1071
01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:41.542
[chattering]

1072
01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:46.292
What's on the docket tonight?

1073
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.042
[Loretta] I'm writing a story
about how Albert DeSalvo

1074
01:07:49.042 --> 01:07:50.792
got a high-priced defense lawyer.

1075
01:07:52.167 --> 01:07:55.083
Would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment?

1076
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.542
No.

1077
01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:59.500
[Loretta] So. what happened
when you went to question him?

1078
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.792
[birds squawking]

1079
01:08:00.792 --> 01:08:04.125
[Jim] <i>Bailey got to him first.
Wouldn't let us interview him.</i>

1080
01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:09.375
<i>So. I brought Sophie Clark's neighbor in
to ID DeSalvo.</i>

1081
01:08:37.458 --> 01:08:38.708
She didn't recognize him?

1082
01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:41.667
Not only did she not recognize him.
she ID'd someone else.

1083
01:08:41.667 --> 01:08:42.792
Who?

1084
01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:44.500
George Nassar.

1085
01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:52.750
<i>Murdered a gas station attendant
during a robbery.</i>

1086
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:57.833
[scoffs] Real piece of work.
Schizophrenic with a genius IQ.

1087
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.250
And?

1088
01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:03.833
It's not him.
Been in custody for over a year.

1089
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:10.333
[reporters clamoring]

1090
01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:13.500
[Bailey] People can breathe
a sigh of relief tonight.

1091
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.292
The career of the Boston Strangler
is over.

1092
01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:18.375
- [reporter 1] Is it true Mr. Bailey?
- [reporter 2] He's telling the truth?

1093
01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:21.792
[Bailey] I obtained five details
only the killer could know.

1094
01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:23.500
When I quizzed DeSalvo.
he went five for five.

1095
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.958
[reporter 3] Mr. Bailey!

1096
01:09:24.958 --> 01:09:29.042
When you've done as many interrogations as
I have. you develop an ear for bullshit.

1097
01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:30.500
[reporters laughing]

1098
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.792
And was law enforcement
a part of this process?

1099
01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.625
That's all I'm gonna say right now.

1100
01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:40.750
We're still negotiating his confession.
If you'll excuse me.

1101
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.250
- [shutter clicks]
- [reporters clamoring]

1102
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.667
[reporter 4] Will he confess?

1103
01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.292
[Bottomly] This is John Bottomly.

1104
01:09:55.833 --> 01:09:58.833
The date is February 14th. 1964.

1105
01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:03.667
Albert. please state your full name.

1106
01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:10.083
Albert Henry DeSalvo.

1107
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.958
[Bottomly] Mr. DeSalvo. we are here today

1108
01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:19.458
because you intend to confess
to all 13 Boston Strangler murders.

1109
01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:20.542
Is that correct?

1110
01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:21.833
Yes.

1111
01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:25.667
Tell me about your first victim.

1112
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.417
How did you pick Anna Slesers?

1113
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.375
I didn't pick her in advance.

1114
01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:34.833
There was a parking spot
in front of the house.

1115
01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:38.333
If there hadn't been a spot.
I never would have got her.

1116
01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.333
[Bottomly] Albert.
what color robe was she wearing?

1117
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.542
[DeSalvo] Yellow.

1118
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.250
Hear about DeSalvo?

1119
01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.708
No. What?

1120
01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:52.500
They sent Bottomly
to take his confession last night.

1121
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.000
Bottomly interviewed him for five hours.

1122
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.958
And?

1123
01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:58.083
No one knows. He hasn't said a word.

1124
01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:10.167
Can I have a word. please?

1125
01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:14.125
I'll catch up.

1126
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:18.208
What's going on with DeSalvo?

1127
01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.792
Nothing.

1128
01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:21.958
If he confessed.
why haven't they charged him?

1129
01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:25.417
Bailey used you guys
to pressure the attorney general.

1130
01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.125
and then he set one condition
for DeSalvo's confession.

1131
01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:31.583
- Yeah. and what's that?
- They're not allowed to use it in court.

1132
01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:33.833
They didn't agree to that.

1133
01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:37.542
They didn't have a choice
after you put DeSalvo on the front page.

1134
01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:40.750
But they think they can get life
on the rape charges.

1135
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:43.750
And they're just gonna ignore the fact
that 13 women were killed?

1136
01:11:45.042 --> 01:11:46.125
That's all I got.

1137
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:51.083
And I haven't even
told you the punch line yet.

1138
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.167
You know how Bailey's gettin' paid?

1139
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:56.333
He got DeSalvo a five-figure book deal.

1140
01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:59.667
A tell-all from the Boston Strangler.

1141
01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.083
Everyone just wants it to be over.

1142
01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:10.208
[footsteps departing]

1143
01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.333
[Loretta]
They're washing their hands of it.

1144
01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.667
and that headline you're about to run
makes it easy for them.

1145
01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:23.250
Come on.
The murders stopped. The guy's in jail.

1146
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.458
What the hell else you want?

1147
01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:27.458
They botched the biggest investigation
in the city's history.

1148
01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:29.458
and you're just gonna let them
sweep it under the rug.

1149
01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:32.458
Aw. come on. Loretta.
How much trouble you gonna cause me today?

1150
01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:34.083
Well. clearly not enough.

1151
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.083
Get outta here. Just take the week off.

1152
01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:39.583
- I'm not taking the week off.
- I'm not asking.

1153
01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:42.708
The police are washing their hands of it.
and you expect us to move on.

1154
01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:44.917
- Loretta.
- We're not doing it.

1155
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.000
I took a new assignment.

1156
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:49.833
You've gotta be kidding me.

1157
01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:56.208
[scoffs] You never see the knife
with you people.

1158
01:12:56.208 --> 01:12:59.375
Don't get it twisted. If there's
another murder. I'll drop everything.

1159
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.708
But until then. we cover the news.
We don't make it.

1160
01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:09.292
[footsteps departing]

1161
01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:11.375
[footsteps approaching]

1162
01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:21.917
Place looks nice.

1163
01:13:21.917 --> 01:13:24.583
[Beverly's parent]
Oh. Sunlight always helps. [chuckles]

1164
01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:29.875
Been reading your stories. You think
they're finally gonna charge him?

1165
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.333
[sighing] Uh. yeah.

1166
01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.375
That's what I want to talk to you about.

1167
01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:43.292
There's gonna be a story
in the papers tomorrow.

1168
01:13:46.167 --> 01:13:49.667
They're not gonna charge Albert
with Beverly's murder.

1169
01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.000
Or any of the murders for that matter.

1170
01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.333
I don't understand. If he confessed...

1171
01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:03.667
They made a deal with his lawyer. and
they can't use his confession in court.

1172
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.875
But they have him on other charges.

1173
01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:10.083
And-- And they're gonna make sure
that he never gets out of prison.

1174
01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:12.000
[Beverly's parent]
But what about my daughter?

1175
01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:16.792
It's not right
to just give up on her like this.

1176
01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:19.375
How can they do that?

1177
01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:27.333
[actor 1 on TV] <i>The price is £20.000.
English pounds sterling.</i>

1178
01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:31.917
- [actor 2 on TV] <i>£20.000?</i>
- [actor 1] <i>Before I state my proposition.</i>

1179
01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:35.250
<i>let me warn you not to breathe a word
of it to anyone except your chief.</i>

1180
01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:38.208

[Bottomly] <i>You-- You sure?</i>

1349
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.250
[DeSalvo] <i>No. It was blue.</i>

1350
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:21.833
[Bottomly] <i>That's right. Let's move on.</i>

1351
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:27.042
So. when you entered the apartment.
can you tell me what you saw?

1352
01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:30.375
[DeSalvo]
Well. the kitchen was on the left.

1353
01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:32.625
[Bottomly] Wait-- It was on the left?

1354
01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:34.875
[DeSalvo] Um. maybe...

1355
01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:37.083
[Bottomly] Well. here. Um...

1356
01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:39.333
[paper rustles on recording]

1357
01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:41.292
[DeSalvo] <i>That's right.
The kitchen was on the right.</i>

1358
01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:43.625
<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1359
01:28:44.333 --> 01:28:45.333
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1360
01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:47.083
[DeSalvo] <i>That-- Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1361
01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:53.625
Bottomly just showed him
the crime scene photo.

1362
01:28:57.958 --> 01:28:59.542
[DeSalvo] <i>Um. maybe...</i>

1363
01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:00.708
[Bottomly] <i>Well. here. Um...</i>

1364
01:29:00.708 --> 01:29:02.458
[paper rustles on recording]

1365
01:29:02.458 --> 01:29:04.417
[DeSalvo] <i>That's right.
The kitchen was on the right.</i>

1366
01:29:04.417 --> 01:29:06.833
<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1367
01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.542
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1368
01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:10.292
[DeSalvo] <i>That-- Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1369
01:29:11.792 --> 01:29:13.917
Any lawyer worth a dime
would pick this apart.

1370
01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:28.208
[Loretta] Excuse me. I'm--
I'm looking for Richard DeSalvo.

1371
01:29:28.208 --> 01:29:29.500
[foreman] He's back there.

1372
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.167
Look.
Al's not talkin' to reporters anymore.

1373
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.167
Al's had it tough.

1374
01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:42.958
Whatever my brother did.
he never meant to harm nobody.

1375
01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:47.917
He loves his family.
always been good to them.

1376
01:29:48.542 --> 01:29:50.375
Look. I know there's more to his story.

1377
01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:54.167
But there's nothing I can do
if he won't talk to me.

1378
01:29:57.458 --> 01:30:00.875
I'll float it by him.
but I'm not making any promises.

1379
01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:06.542
[phone rings]

1380
01:30:07.208 --> 01:30:08.292
<i>Record American</i>.

1381
01:30:08.833 --> 01:30:10.458
[DeSalvo] <i>Yeah. this is Albert DeSalvo.</i>

1382
01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:11.833
<i>Is. uh. Loretta there?</i>

1383
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:14.833
One minute. please.

1384
01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:23.458
Albert DeSalvo's on line two. [sighs]

1385
01:30:30.917 --> 01:30:33.000
Uh. this is Loretta.

1386
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.500
<i>Hi. Loretta. It's Albert.</i>

1387
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.000
You know. my brother said
you come to see him.

1388
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.333
I told him that I knew you
from the papers.

1389
01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:42.083
[chuckles] It's funny. I always said
you girls knew more than the police.

1390
01:30:43.458 --> 01:30:46.792
Uh. why don't I come down there
so we can talk in person?

1391
01:30:47.417 --> 01:30:50.292
The thing is. I'm not giving my story away
for free anymore.

1392
01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:53.625
I got really screwed over
on that book deal.

1393
01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:55.708
[Loretta]
<i>I listened to your confession. Albert.</i>

1394
01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:58.625
and. uh. I think
there's more to your story.

1395
01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:01.375
Well. like I said.
I'm not talking to reporters anymore.

1396
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.250
Don't you want people to know the truth?

1397
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:06.583
<i>I don't give a damn about that.</i>

1398
01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:07.917
I've got a family to support.

1399
01:31:07.917 --> 01:31:09.917
I don't think you understand
how screwed over I got.

1400
01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:12.667
Well. what are you holding out for.
Albert?

1401
01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:15.583
If everybody already screwed you over.
then what've you got left to lose?

1402
01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:18.208
<i>Why would you let them get away with it?</i>

1403
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.125
Come here tomorrow at visiting hours.

1404
01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:54.417

<i>Hey. it's Jack.
A report just came over the wire.</i>

1411

<i>DeSalvo was killed in his cell.</i> [sighs]

1412
01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:23.875
<i>I'm sorry. kid.</i>

You get anything?

1416
01:32:38.208 --> 01:32:39.708
[Stanley] No official statement yet.

1417
01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:42.417
My guys at the <i>Herald</i> said
he got killed over drugs. but--

1418
01:32:42.417 --> 01:32:43.792
No. that doesn't make any sense.

1419
01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.125
[reporters clamoring]

1420
01:32:51.042 --> 01:32:53.458
He was in there with them.
He knew what they were up to.

1422

Hello.

1423
01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:06.333
I need you to take down an address.

1424
01:33:06.958 --> 01:33:08.958
If I don't call back in an hour.
give it to the police.

1425
01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:10.667
What the hell are you doing?

1426
01:33:10.667 --> 01:33:14.417
426 Columbia Road. Got it?

1427
01:33:14.417 --> 01:33:15.750
Got it.

1428
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:16.917
Loretta--

1429
01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:21.292
Shit.

1430
01:33:21.292 --> 01:33:22.500
[doorbell buzzes]

1431
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.583
[footsteps approaching]

1432
01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:34.542
I'm lookin' for Harrison.

1433
01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.000
He's down at the end of the hall.

1434
01:33:40.417 --> 01:33:41.917
[resident 1 coughing]

1435
01:33:47.417 --> 01:33:50.792
- [resident 2 moaning]
- [muffled thudding]

1436
01:34:08.417 --> 01:34:09.417
[Loretta] Harrison?

1437
01:34:09.417 --> 01:34:10.500
Yeah.

1438
01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:13.125
I-I'm a reporter with the <i>Record American</i>.

1439
01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:16.125
I want to ask you some questions
about Bridgewater.

1440
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:26.625
Me and DeSalvo were in the same ward.
I saw him every day.

1441
01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:32.292
And what about... him?

1442
01:34:36.458 --> 01:34:39.458
Yeah. He was in my ward too.

1443
01:34:41.292 --> 01:34:42.792
They were always together.

1444
01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:44.625
Marsh and DeSalvo?

1445
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.542
And Nassar.

1446
01:34:47.792 --> 01:34:49.292
George Nassar?

1447
01:34:57.042 --> 01:35:00.708
Yeah. the three of them were always
working on DeSalvo's confession.

1448
01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:04.542
W-What do you mean working on?

1449
01:35:05.542 --> 01:35:09.208
They coached him.
They were at it every day for weeks.

1450
01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.708
<i>They had a stack of newspaper clippings.</i>

1451
01:35:12.708 --> 01:35:16.417
<i>and they would quiz DeSalvo
about the details.</i>

1452
01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:20.083
<i>I remember Marsh sayin'.</i>

1453
01:35:20.083 --> 01:35:23.417
<i>"You gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself."</i>

1454
01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:28.125
But what did they care
if DeSalvo confessed?

1455
01:35:31.208 --> 01:35:35.042
Reward money.
That's why Nassar got his lawyer involved.

1456
01:35:35.625 --> 01:35:36.875
I'm not shittin' you.

1457
01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.625
He's willing to confess
to the whole thing.

1458
01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:43.417
[Harrison]
<i>His lawyer organized the whole thing.</i>

1459
01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:45.750
You mean F. Lee Bailey?

1460
01:35:46.792 --> 01:35:47.792
That's right.

1461
01:35:48.917 --> 01:35:53.417
He told Albert that he could get him
a book deal. make him rich and famous.

1462
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.500
Albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it

1463
01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:01.750
and support his family.

1464
01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:57.167
You got a smoke?

1465
01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:19.125
So. you wanna know about Albert.

1466
01:37:20.333 --> 01:37:21.625
How did you know each other?

1467
01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:23.750
We were cellmates.

1468
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.167
[Loretta] Before he confessed?

1469
01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:27.875
Yeah. for a couple months.

1470
01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:30.375
It's an awfully strange coincidence.
don't you think?

1471
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:34.250
You're the one
who gets picked out of the lineup.

1472
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:38.000
and you just happen to be
DeSalvo's cellmate?

1473
01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:40.958
Maybe I just got one of those faces.

1474
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:46.750
Were you in Sophie Clark's building
the day she was killed?

1475
01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:48.875
No.

1476
01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:51.792
I don't kill women.

1477
01:37:53.292 --> 01:37:57.792
And I got no reason to lie about that now.
I'm doin' a life sentence.

1478
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:02.000
[Loretta] Then why did you coach DeSalvo?

1479
01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:04.250
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

1480
01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:08.958
I was just helpin' him remember.

1481
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:12.917
Thirteen murders.
that's a lot to keep straight.

1482
01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:14.208
Why were you helping him?

1483
01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:18.833
Reward money. Ten grand a victim.

1484
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:24.250
So. the more murders he confessed to.
the more money you'd make?

1485
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:27.667
Well. might as well take credit
for all of them.

1486
01:38:27.667 --> 01:38:29.042
Make a little extra money.

1487
01:38:29.042 --> 01:38:31.292
It was a lot of extra money.

1488
01:38:33.958 --> 01:38:38.792
And regardless of what you think.
Albert convinced me he killed those women.

1489
01:38:41.167 --> 01:38:42.417
Was it all 13?

1490
01:38:44.292 --> 01:38:45.542
What does it really matter?

1491
01:38:47.958 --> 01:38:52.125
See. you all created a myth.
and it needed to be stopped.

1492
01:38:54.125 --> 01:38:55.542
People wanted to believe it was Al.

1493
01:38:55.542 --> 01:38:58.292
but they needed to believe
that it was Albert.

1494
01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:02.125
The alternative was just too disturbin'.

1495
01:39:04.875 --> 01:39:05.958
What's that?

1496
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.750
There are many Albert DeSalvos out there.

1497
01:39:13.208 --> 01:39:15.292
And your safe little world
is just a delusion.

1498
01:39:19.542 --> 01:39:20.708
Men kill women.

1499
01:39:22.458 --> 01:39:23.875
It didn't start with Albert.

1500
01:39:25.625 --> 01:39:27.542
Sure as hell doesn't end with him either.

1501
01:39:45.667 --> 01:39:48.250
[Loretta] <i>If Dr. Grayson was right
about these killers having a type--</i>

1502
01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:51.625
The first five murders
were all elderly women.

1503
01:39:52.667 --> 01:39:54.958
- <i>And if Paul Dempsey had a type...</i>
- [shutter clicks]

1504
01:39:54.958 --> 01:39:56.708
It was elderly women.

1505
01:39:56.708 --> 01:39:59.625
[Loretta] <i>DeSalvo was a pathological liar.</i>

1506
01:40:00.458 --> 01:40:03.958
<i>Everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers.</i>

1507
01:40:03.958 --> 01:40:06.000
<i>or it was given to him by Bottomly.</i>

1508
01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:10.208
<i>But of the hundreds of women
DeSalvo assaulted.</i>

1509
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.833
all his victims were young.

1510
01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:16.042
<i>And then Paul Dempsey moves on
to New York.</i>

1511
01:40:16.667 --> 01:40:18.583
<i>and the Strangler starts killing
younger women.</i>

1512
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.458
<i>Then other men use the Strangler as cover
to get rid of women</i>

1513
01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:25.042
<i>they didn't want around anymore.</i>

<i>The boss who got his secretary pregnant.</i>

1515
01:40:28.458 --> 01:40:30.042
<i>The psychotic ex-boyfriend.</i>

1516
01:40:33.667 --> 01:40:37.333
<i>Then DeSalvo ends up at Bridgewater
with Nassar and Marsh.</i>

1517
01:40:38.667 --> 01:40:40.000
<i>They use DeSalvo.</i>

1518
01:40:40.708 --> 01:40:43.917
<i>Nassar gets F. Lee Bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money.</i>

1519
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.167
And they coached DeSalvo
before he confessed.

1520
01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:50.875
He just became a convenient way out
for everybody else.

1521
01:40:51.542 --> 01:40:53.708
<i>The entire city just wanted to move on.</i>

1522
01:40:59.917 --> 01:41:01.750

1524
01:41:08.625 --> 01:41:10.417
<i>And people got away with murder.</i>

[Jack] It's nice work. kid.

1526
01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:12.500
Commissioner. Commissioner!

1527
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.708
What is your response to the story
in the <i>Record American</i> today?

1528
01:42:15.708 --> 01:42:17.625
Commissioner. what is your response?

1529
01:42:19.292 --> 01:42:22.917
All the Strangler murders
are still open cases.

1530
01:42:22.917 --> 01:42:24.333
I'll leave it at that.

1532
01:42:27.083 --> 01:42:28.292
[reporter] Commissioner!

1533
01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.375
How many suspects do you have?
