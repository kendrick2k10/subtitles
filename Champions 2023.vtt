Then he got the Ohio State job.

he lost the Ohio State job

on one of his players.

135
00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:16.978

Now he's an assistant coach
for the Iowa Stallions.

137

You're a meme now.

No. It's not.

All right. Okay.

191
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.461
I-I messed up. obviously.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.364
and I... I'm sorry.

193
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.774
-You don't sound sorry.
-Well. I am sorry.

194
00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:58.942
I mean. I'm not entirely sorry.

195
00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:01.043
I mean. should I apologize

196
00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:02.715

a basketball game?

197
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.541
By knocking me on my ass?

198
00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.654
Look. I... I'm frustrated
because you never listen to me.

I told you
that lob play was dumb.

If you'd have run
the split action with Derrick...

201
00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:15.255
Do you know why I didn't run
the play with Derrick?

202
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.158
(stammers) A misdirection maybe.

203
00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:19.226
but at least use him
as a decoy and...

204
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.558
His grandmother
is in the hospital.

205
00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:23.670

206
00:09:23.705 --> 00:09:25.001
Mm. Okay.

207
00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:27.597
Well. I mean. she's old. right?

208
00:09:27.632 --> 00:09:30.468
It shouldn't matter. Marcus!
The woman raised him.

209
00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.471
Look. he was upset.
His head wasn't in the game.

210
00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.341
But you wouldn't know that

211
00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.783
because you don't bother
to get to know any of the guys.

212
00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.345
What do you mean?
I know the guys.

said. "Take community service."

Big balls. Yeah.

424
00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:19.029
What's that guy's deal?

425

-Showtime? He's a specialist.
-A specialist?

426
00:18:21.704 --> 00:18:23.539
Yeah. he's the only player
in the league

427
00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:26.410
who shoots backwards from half
court. and he's on our team.

428
00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.479
Pretty good shot. huh. Coach?

429
00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:32.042
No. that's a terrible shot.

430
00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:37.190
Now. that's a good shot.

before you know it.

impossible is not a fact.

You don't have to turn them

to feel like a team.

You know. I snuck
a couple peeks in there today.

you were doing good.

Uh-huh. Huh. I hear he has two.

453
00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:39.516
Well. it's not clear.

454

You know. the one guy
who can actually play

455
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:43.113
won't play for me.

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:45.214
Yeah. Darius.

457
00:19:45.249 --> 00:19:46.721
Ah. you know what?

458
00:19:46.756 --> 00:19:48.921
I... I don't. I don't care.

459
00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:51.187

00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:55.895

what-what happened to the guy

462
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.435
who was coaching before me?

463
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.372
Oh. we don't talk about him.

464
00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:02.374

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:03.540
No.

No. no.

00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:05.938
He quit before
the season was over.

468
00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:08.237
The team was very upset.

-Yeah.

538
00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:52.610
But at least
we're finally hanging out.

539
00:22:52.645 --> 00:22:54.106
You got a great place here.

540
00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:55.547
Yep.

541
00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:57.043
Uh. hey. by the way.

542
00:22:57.078 --> 00:22:58.550
(clears throat)
let me ask you something.

543
00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:02.114
-I cannot stay out
the entire season. -Mm-mm.

544
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:05.249
And I've been working
my. uh. connections.

545
00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:07.251
but it occurs to me that

546
00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:10.760
your uncle is one of the most
respected GMs in basketball.

547
00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:15.391
And is it possible you could
talk to him and help me out?

548
00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:16.667
Absolutely.

549
00:23:16.702 --> 00:23:18.504
(chuckles):
Yeah?

550
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.968
-Yeah.
-Oh.

551
00:23:21.003 --> 00:23:23.971
(stammers) But I don't want it
to be. you know. minor league.

552
00:23:24.006 --> 00:23:27.513
-I-I want it to be the NBA.
-Yeah.

553
00:23:27.548 --> 00:23:30.175
You know. fifth assistant.
uh. player development.

554
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.342
whatever it is. NBA.

555
00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:34.245
Gotcha. I'm on it.

556
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.521
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

557
00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:38.018
I knew it. I knew it.

558
00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:39.415
-You're the man.
-You're the man.

559
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.757
-No. you're the man.
-No.

560
00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:43.661
Sir. you are the man.

561
00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:47.291
All right. I am the man.

562
00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:48.765
-You're right.
-(laughs)

563
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.031
Hey. you know what?

564
00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:54.001
After I talk to my uncle.
we should go out.

565
00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:56.509
Hit the clurb.
Get crunk. Get crazy.

566
00:23:56.544 --> 00:23:57.840
-(chuckles)
-And I'll give you the update.

567
00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.710
Listen.

568
00:23:59.745 --> 00:24:01.547
I got an idea.

569
00:24:01.582 --> 00:24:02.680
Text me.

570
00:24:02.715 --> 00:24:04.715
Lunch. then.

571
00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:09.346
Okay. guys.
today we're gonna work on

572
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:11.282
the fundamentals of passing.

573
00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:13.625
Arthur. come over here.
help me out.

574
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.727
All right? Now. we're gonna
start with the bounce pass.

575
00:24:16.762 --> 00:24:17.992
You ready?

576
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.896
Okay. you see that?

577
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:23.393
Thumbs behind the ball.
flick of the wrist. bounce pass.

578
00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:25.197
Right? Got it?

579
00:24:25.232 --> 00:24:26.836
Okay. throw it
back to me. Arthur.

580
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:28.332
Good. Good.

581
00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:30.301
Now we're going to do
the chest pass.

582
00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:32.578
Same thing. no bounce.

583
00:24:32.613 --> 00:24:34.646
Got it? Nice.

584
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.747
Hey. Coach. your shoe's untied.

585
00:24:38.278 --> 00:24:39.717
-Made you look.
-(laughter)

586
00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:41.213
Oh. that's very funny. Yeah.

587
00:24:41.248 --> 00:24:42.379
(grunts)

588
00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:45.184
(laughter continues)

589
00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:47.417
Arthur. what the hell?

590
00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:49.188
Sorry. Coach.

591
00:24:49.223 --> 00:24:50.695
Uh. wasn't I supposed
to toss it back to you?

592
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.521
Yeah. but the guy
has to be ready.

593
00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:54.259
-That's a crucial part
of this... -(phone ringing)

594
00:24:54.294 --> 00:24:55.524
Uh...

595
00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.394
Oh. all right. Uh. hang on.

596
00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.066
You guys. uh. shoot around
a little bit.

597
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:00.738
I'll be right back.

598
00:25:00.773 --> 00:25:02.740
-Ball. ball. ball.
-MARCUS: Kenny.

599
00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:04.841
How you doing. buddy?

600
00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:07.536
How's everything going
in. uh. Seattle?

601
00:25:07.571 --> 00:25:08.581
Yeah? Oh--

602
00:25:08.616 --> 00:25:10.374
Hey! What the hell?!

603
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:15.346
Yeah. no. I'm okay.
I'll call you right back.

604
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.622
Guys. what are you doing?

605
00:25:16.657 --> 00:25:17.150
Shooting around.

606
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.221
-Big balls.
-What am I looking at here?

607
00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:23.728
Big balls celebration.

608
00:25:23.763 --> 00:25:26.060
like when an NBA player
hits a big shot.

609
00:25:26.095 --> 00:25:27.424
Big balls.

610
00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.096
Oh. but you got to hit
the shot. right?

611
00:25:29.131 --> 00:25:30.636
I mean. you don't celebrate
a miss.

612
00:25:30.671 --> 00:25:33.738
Showtime does.
He knows all the celebrations.

613
00:25:33.773 --> 00:25:35.300
He's a student of the game.

614
00:25:35.335 --> 00:25:37.104
Aha.

615
00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:38.776
Watch this.

616
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:41.471
Do shimmies. Steph Curry.

617
00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.714
Look at that.

618
00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:44.045
Aha.

619
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.652
(laughing)

620
00:25:46.687 --> 00:25:48.753
That is outstanding.

621
00:25:48.788 --> 00:25:50.887
Hey. uh...

622
00:25:50.922 --> 00:25:54.792
has he ever actually hit
one of those backward shots?

623
00:25:54.827 --> 00:25:56.827
In the five years
I've played with him.

624
00:25:56.862 --> 00:26:00.259
he's never even hit the rim.
but he's due.

625
00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:01.194
-Huh.
-Mm-hmm.

626
00:26:03.836 --> 00:26:05.330
Huh. pretty impressive.

627
00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:09.807
Hey.

628
00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:11.336
Sounded like
you guys were having fun

629
00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:13.679
-out there today. huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

630
00:26:13.714 --> 00:26:15.648
Well. Arthur gave me
a concussion.

631
00:26:15.683 --> 00:26:18.145
but. uh. yeah.
other than that. pretty fun.

632
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.576
Oh. Well. we don't have
any insurance.

633
00:26:20.611 --> 00:26:22.248
so I never heard that.

634
00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:24.283
(laughing)

635
00:26:24.318 --> 00:26:26.615

See you Thursday. Coach.

636
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.023
Okay. Benny.

637
00:26:28.058 --> 00:26:30.025
You be good.

638
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.126
Please tell me
he's not gonna ride that thing.

639
00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:33.457
JULIO:
Well. sure.

640
00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:35.426
I mean. he lives
all the way across town.

641
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:38.132
so he comes back and forth
on that scooter every day.

642
00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:41.003
MARCUS: I mean. he's gonna
kill himself. All that ice.

643
00:26:41.038 --> 00:26:44.677
Well. as far as I know. he's
never had a single accident.

644
00:26:44.712 --> 00:26:46.745
Uh. can you say the same?

645
00:26:47.748 --> 00:26:49.638
Touché.

646
00:26:49.673 --> 00:26:52.377
These guys are capable
of a lot more than you think.

647
00:26:52.412 --> 00:26:54.016
You'd be surprised.

Guys. today.
I am going to teach you

796
00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:14.099
the most beautiful play
in basketball.

797
00:33:14.134 --> 00:33:17.201
It's called the "pick-and-roll."

798
00:33:17.236 --> 00:33:21.073
I love this play.

799
00:33:21.108 --> 00:33:24.604
And when it is done right.
it gives me a hard-on.

800
00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:26.111
What the hell?

801
00:33:26.146 --> 00:33:28.410
Oh. sorry. Cody.
It-It's just the truth.

802
00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:30.214
Will it give me a hard-on?

803
00:33:30.249 --> 00:33:31.908
Well. if you're lucky. Marlon.

804
00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:35.516
Okay.
Now. Blair. you come defend me.

805
00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:37.254
Johnny. you're on my team.

806
00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:38.684
Benny. you're defending Johnny.

807
00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:40.851
Okay?

808
00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:43.018
Now. what happens is

809
00:33:43.053 --> 00:33:45.559
I start to come to the right.
toward you. Johnny.

810
00:33:45.594 --> 00:33:47.693
You step up
and set a pick on Blair.

811
00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:49.233
Where do I set it?

812
00:33:49.268 --> 00:33:51.301
You set it right here
at his elbow.

813
00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:53.270
Good. Good. Good.

814
00:33:53.305 --> 00:33:55.371
Oh. Oh.

815
00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:58.033
My God. you have
got to take a shower.

816
00:33:58.068 --> 00:33:59.771
Everyone says that.

817
00:33:59.806 --> 00:34:01.740
Yeah. and everyone's right.
I mean. I'm tearing.

818
00:34:01.775 --> 00:34:04.413
Okay. you setting the pick?

819
00:34:04.448 --> 00:34:06.415
Okay. Do you have a pick?

820
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.120
No. you are the pick.

821
00:34:08.155 --> 00:34:10.551
Be-be like a statue.

822
00:34:10.586 --> 00:34:13.620
Good. And now I start
to come this way.

823
00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:15.490
They both have to come out.

824
00:34:15.525 --> 00:34:18.790
and that gives you
a chance to roll. Johnny.

825
00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:21.298
-Roll? -Yeah.
You-you move toward the basket.

826
00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:24.169
-Move toward the basket.
-But I'm a statue.

827
00:34:24.204 --> 00:34:27.436
-Statues don't move.
-Forget I said "statue."

828
00:34:29.176 --> 00:34:29.702
I can't.

829
00:34:32.707 --> 00:34:33.805
Okay.

830
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.007
There you have it.
the pick-and-roll.

831
00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:40.416
Did it give you
a hard-on. Coach?

832
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:44.156
No. Marlon. In fact.
I think my dick just evaporated.

833
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:46.015
That sounds serious.

834
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.523
Hmm. Yeah. it is.

835
00:34:54.234 --> 00:34:57.268
Hey. did you tell your boss
we got that road game in Ames?

836
00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:59.666
Yes. but I have a doubt.

837
00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:01.767
What doubt?

838
00:35:01.802 --> 00:35:03.835
I think he'll say yes.
but I have this doubt.

839
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.773
-What doubt?
-This doubt.

840
00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:09.643
Okay. Okay. Fine.

841
00:35:09.678 --> 00:35:13.779
Uh. if you have any more doubts.
come talk to me. all right?

842
00:35:13.814 --> 00:35:16.353
Hey. Johnny. Jump in the shower.

843
00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:19.620
I don't believe in showers.

844
00:35:19.655 --> 00:35:21.721
-What does that mean?
-He's afraid of the water.

00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:39.640
Oh.

856

-MARLON: That's not a rat.
-It's just a little mouse.

857

JOHNNY:
Save it. Coach.

858
00:35:42.909 --> 00:35:44.546

865
00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.559
-Where'd it go?!
-Down the drain.

866
00:35:57.594 --> 00:35:59.924
It gonna drown down there.
for real.

867
00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:01.893
During drowning.
your lungs fill with water.

868
00:36:01.928 --> 00:36:03.400
you can't get proper oxygen.

during the weekday?

1224
00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:49.654
-No.
-I perform Shakespeare

1225
00:49:49.689 --> 00:49:51.986
for middle school kids
right after lunch.

1226
00:49:52.021 --> 00:49:53.757
Um. do you know
what middle school kids

1227
00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:55.429

1230

it's acting. and I love acting.

So. after that.
I go home and I do

1232
00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:05.274
a lot of freelance bookkeeping
because Shakespeare--

1233
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:06.770
and brace yourself here.
this might blow your mind--

Johnny from work.

the whole afternoon together.

You don't want me
to come to your house.

that if I get involved
with a guy. you know.

And if it doesn't work out.
then he can get very hurt.
