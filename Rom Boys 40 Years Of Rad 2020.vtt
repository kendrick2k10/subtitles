3
00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:22.125
Am I alright to wet
my whistle quicky?

4
00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:29.926
No. no. no...

5
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.685
Wait. wait wait! Come on!

6
00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:32.135
What are we doing?

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.274
Put it right by Lance's face.

8
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.758
- Yeah. there we go.
- There we go.

9
00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.312
- Can we get a...
- Yeah.

10
00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:39.246
- Rolling...
- Check mate.

11
00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:42.490
- Check please.

12
00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:43.698
Czech Republic.

13
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.665
- Czechoslovakia.
- Czechoslovakia.

14
00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:48.669
How bad does that look?

15
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:50.257
You got me thinking.
I'm a bit...

16
00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:51.879
Are you allowed to swear in it?

17
00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:55.331
I'm 53 years old.

18
00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:56.711
Old enough to know better.

19
00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:04.434
It's the most unlikely thing
to find

20
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.782
in this suburban
semi-industrial bit of Essex.

21
00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:18.138
I always found it quite
magical. coming over here.

22
00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:23.246
I think about this amazing
kind of lunar landscape.

23
00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:25.593
Like tonight you look
at beautiful blue skies.

24
00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.113
The way the shadows kind
of come off everything.

25
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.498
I never ever get bored of
walking through the door.

26
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.543
I actually think about
Dion and Jonesy and Rob

27
00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:48.651
and Graham. and the people thatare sort of there. every Sunday

28
00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:52.620
It is a group of people that
you really associate with Rom.

29
00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:59.524
People come over and
they. they just get on.

30
00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.905
Why would you go to Rom?

31
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.113
Which is rough...

32
00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:07.980
Looks a bit tired and you
have to pay to get in.

33
00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:10.776
Well. you've got to go
there for a special reason.

34
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.847
What's special about Rom?

35
00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:18.612
Well. the pool is the thing
above all which is special.

36
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:24.618
But not only is it a pool.
it's a sort of legit pool.

37
00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:27.862
It's a tough. scary
bastard of a pool.

38
00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:30.244
that you know. makes
you feel a bit afraid

39
00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.280
everytime you drop into it.

40
00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.507
You go there to immerse
yourself in 40 years of

41
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:53.371
British skateboard history.

42
00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:57.478
And to sort of be wrappedup in that whole thing

43
00:03:57.513 --> 00:03:58.514
of being back in '78.

44
00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:02.449
and by extension back into the
backyard pools of California.

45
00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:05.624
To step into a landscape...

46
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.937
where you've got this pool.

47
00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:12.321
which has been consciously
designed on the back garden

48
00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:15.772
pool of an American film star

49
00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:17.084
or whatever.

50
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.983
Where kids used to break
in and skate around.

51
00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:24.678
In cultural terms. that's
absolutely extraordinary

52
00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.093
when you think about it.

53
00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:29.959
I mean. when did you guysstart doing the whole

54
00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:32.479
kind of breaking in and draining pools?

55
00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:33.825
It's all fake.

56
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.309
That's so fake.

57
00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:39.106
Yes. It's all lies. All myth.

58
00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:41.488
Every time Dion skates the pool

59
00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:43.006
he's in California

60
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:45.008
and Dion's skated backyard
pools in California

61
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:48.702
He knows what it means. It'snot just an imagination for him.

62
00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:51.705
He's done it. And
that's what he's doing.

63
00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.879
We went out to Palm Springsone year.

64
00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:54.915
and actually got to drain a pool

65
00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.538
and skate and do
that whole thing. you know?

66
00:04:57.573 --> 00:04:59.678
And it was just like. I
couldn't sleep that night.

67
00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:02.681
I aimed to do all my life.
it's just. I've done it. What

68
00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:05.788
You know. it's part what.
what it was about for years.

69
00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:09.239
think God. love to do that.
watch it in videos and

70
00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.449
But if there's just not
pools like that over here.

71
00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:14.693
There is breaking in.

72
00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:16.108
There was. there was...

73
00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:19.146
But it's still like romanticallyblown out of proportion.

74
00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:22.252
You don't just come here andrip this park.

75
00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:24.841
It's got its own flavour and its own scenario.

76
00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:27.119
You'd put a little...time and energy.

77
00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:28.604
Maybe you two can rip this
park.

78
00:05:28.638 --> 00:05:30.606
but you don't justcome here and start ripping.

79
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.646
Wow! Yeah!

80
00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:40.409
Oh whoa!

81
00:05:40.443 --> 00:05:41.444
You gotta want that rip.

82
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.350
Nothing's free here. you know.

83
00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.045
Rough and... Rough and
steep and deep and gnarly.

84
00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:00.360
But it's good.

85
00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:06.538
I tried to find it and I couldn't find it.

86
00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:08.678
I drove past it several times.

87
00:06:10.818 --> 00:06:13.614
There were no signs sayingskate park here.

88
00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:18.067
You know. it's almost as if
it's deliberately hidden away.

89
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:20.828
As this sort of slightly
kind of secret society...

90
00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:24.038
Or like a golf club that
you don't see the golf club

91
00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:27.179
because it's up the driveway
and behind the trees

92
00:06:27.214 --> 00:06:28.871
and behind the fences.

93
00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.873
It's got a little bit
of that character.

94
00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:34.842
It's this sort of extraordinarything when you finally find it.

95
00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:40.883
Adrian Rolt from G force. who
are the people that built Rom.

96
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:44.093
went out to America. looked
at a load of skate parks.

97
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.752
Saw Skateboard Heaven at SpringValley and some other parks.

98
00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:50.202
came back to Britain

99
00:06:50.237 --> 00:06:52.066
and started building a wholeseries of skate parks.

100
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.828
which effectively they built during 1978.

101
00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.624
Rom is one of the last tobe built.

102
00:06:57.658 --> 00:07:00.592
But the very last is one
in Gillingham

103
00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:04.424
called Black Lion Skate Park
right at the end of '78.

104
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.806
They all have this kit of parts.

105
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:10.602
of a Pool. and a Half Pipe. anda

106
00:07:10.637 --> 00:07:14.503
Snake Run. and some Moguls.
and a Cloverleaf. and so on.

107
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:19.093
But Rom is the only one that hasthe full set of all those bits.

108
00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:24.098
I was a professional skater

109
00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.031
and other professional skaters
came to the Rom

110
00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:27.067
while it was being built.

111
00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:30.450
and they saw the quality
of the construction.

112
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:35.075
and they warned the owner
that it wasn't good enough.

113
00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:36.525
It wasn't smooth enough.

114
00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:40.080
I mean they had someproblems building Rom.

115
00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:44.602
It was built in one of
the worst summers in
British history with rain.

116
00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:47.501
It finally opened in the August.

117
00:07:47.536 --> 00:07:48.916
It was supposed to have
opened at the beginning of

118
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:49.952
the six weeks holidays...

119
00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:52.782
But it pissed rain all Spring
so they had a lot of trouble

120
00:07:52.817 --> 00:07:54.474
finishing the concrete.

121
00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:57.373
And it finally opened
in the middle of August.

122
00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:59.271
And it just. I remember
walking in for the first

123
00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:00.169
time and just like. 'Wow'.

124
00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:01.688
We'd never seen a skate
park. There was no such

125
00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:02.723
thing in England. you know.

126
00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:05.795
That we'd had really
any proper experience.

127
00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:08.798
It's just... Died
and gone to heaven!

128
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.181
And I've been in heaven ever
since! On and off. you know.

129
00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:17.600
So then he talked to his
architect and the architect

130
00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:20.707
searched a few resources

131
00:08:20.845 --> 00:08:23.123
in the skateboard
industry and found me.

132
00:08:23.157 --> 00:08:25.125
I had been in California.

133
00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:29.336
I had skated skate parks thereand I might know what the

134
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.718
standards of a skate park were..

135
00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.167
What is required?

136
00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:36.688
And so they hired me to
come out here and consult

137
00:08:36.723 --> 00:08:38.621
with this construction crew.

138
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:42.349
They had made this bowl
and part of the halfpipe.

139
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.007
And it was really rough.

140
00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:50.702
It was uneven surface.
not suitable for the

141
00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:52.186
rest of the skate park.

142
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:56.225
So. I consulted them
and they insulted me!

143
00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.988
It was a rough day
or two there.

144
00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:03.922
They were really hard on me.

145
00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:07.754
Construction crew up against a20 year old kid from California

146
00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:09.479
who is a skateboarder.

147
00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:11.551
They listened to me though
and you can see how the

148
00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:13.898
rest of the park is smooth.

149
00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:18.419
Except for the largeaggregate in the sand.

150
00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:19.869
which makes it a rough surface.

151
00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:22.803
It's a smooth design.

152
00:09:23.217 --> 00:09:25.599
The local papers were full ofthis news about this skateboard

153
00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:26.600
park thats going to be opening.

154
00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:30.880
And so I went over. tookthe tube over and saw

155
00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:32.261
them levelling the land.

156
00:09:32.295 --> 00:09:34.574
Saw them putting down the
steel frame for the concrete.

157
00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:38.439
I actually started skating
it before it opened.

158
00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:41.063
So where the workers would be there laying the concrete and I

159
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.547
would wait until they went home.

160
00:09:42.823 --> 00:09:44.307
And try skating the place.

161
00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:46.171
Sometimes the concrete
was a bit wet. so it

162
00:09:46.206 --> 00:09:47.587
wasn't necessarily good.

163
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.248
There was this mouthy. gobby
little ginger haired guy

164
00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:55.595
that turned out to
be Robbie Hunter.

165
00:09:56.112 --> 00:09:57.389
He said "They're buildinga skate park across the

166
00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:58.528
road from my house".

167
00:09:58.563 --> 00:09:59.599
So I'm like "No they're not!".

168
00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:00.910
"Yes they are.
come and have a look".

169
00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:02.187
So. alright.

170
00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:04.051
So we came down the upperRainham road.

171
00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.639
looked over the builders hoarding and sure enough

172
00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:06.640
this place was being built.

173
00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:09.781
The first thing that was built
was the Performance Bowl.

174
00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:11.611
We used to come down here
at night. jump the fence

175
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.060
and skate a bit when
the builders had gone.

176
00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:14.544
We got chased out.

177
00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:16.546
I think they got wise to kids
getting in. they sort of put

178
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:17.651
security guard here I think.

179
00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:19.101
You couldn't get in
here in the evenings.

180
00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:22.656
I must have been such a
pain in the backside for the

181
00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:24.762
builders and for the owners.

182
00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:30.491
One of the most evident
changes at Rom today

183
00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:32.217
is how much rougher it is today

184
00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:34.841
than when it was back in'78 when it was first built.

185
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.016
The park was so brandnew. The concrete was

186
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:39.777
a bluey. bluey white.

187
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.675
Yeah. it was all white.
Pure white when I

188
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.711
come over here

189
00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:44.333
You got like a white
residue on your wheels

190
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.368
coz it was so new.

191
00:10:45.403 --> 00:10:46.956
It had only been open
about three months.

192
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.855
But I just remember
it being a bright day.

193
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:52.168
The Rom skate park was so
clean and the pool

194
00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:55.551
Still looking that crystal white. with a sparkle to it.

195
00:10:57.346 --> 00:11:01.074
It felt like a different
world from like a grey rainy

196
00:11:01.108 --> 00:11:02.316
council estate in Essex.

197
00:11:02.351 --> 00:11:04.249
And I thought. yeah.
this is a life. this is

198
00:11:04.284 --> 00:11:05.941
a place I'd like to be.

199
00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:10.048
And somehow they built this
little corner of California

200
00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:11.187
all grey and rain streaked..

201
00:11:11.222 --> 00:11:13.742
But nevertheless. a little
corner of California

202
00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:14.674
in Hornchurch.

203
00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:17.055
No one knew how to make
a skate park. They just

204
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.022
started pouring concrete.

205
00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:21.025
What they thought America
had poured. you know?

206
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:25.132
They had no idea of thesethings. It was all experimental.

207
00:11:25.374 --> 00:11:28.204
The fact that you guys got
that stuff built.

208
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.103
and it's still there
is just...

209
00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:31.760
It's incredible.

210
00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:36.592
Rom is the complete collector's
edition of G force skate parks

211
00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.836
and has everything in it
that they they ever built.

212
00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:41.010
We're in Romford right?

213
00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:43.254
I feel like I'm in San Diego!

214
00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:50.571
That transition. not
just in sporting terms

215
00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:55.542
but in cultural terms. indesign terms is amazing really.

216
00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.237
And so. to see these designscarved out of these holes

217
00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:03.136
in the ground in Essex.

218
00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:05.932
A county I should add.

219
00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:08.313
where Americanism was
really significant.

220
00:12:08.348 --> 00:12:11.109
Because of the American air
bases in East Anglia

221
00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:13.560
to a certain extent. Dagenham
at Fords.

222
00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:15.665
which is an
American intervention.

223
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.567
You see this a lot across
Essex and across East Anglia.

224
00:12:21.948 --> 00:12:25.330
For myself and many. many
other kids of

225
00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:26.366
my generation
growing up in the '80s.

226
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.126
we were just thrill seekers.

227
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:30.646
We was spoonfed a hell
of a lot of stuff that

228
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.854
come out of the States.

229
00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:33.925
And we just. we just
lapped it up. you know.

230
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.410
We were a dry sponge. we
become a wet sponge and

231
00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:38.481
we just lapped everything up.

232
00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:41.933
I set about every single
day.

233
00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.625
Every single free
moment I had practising.

234
00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:48.388
Doing every trick in the book.
You know. reading

235
00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:50.424
every American magazine
I can get my hands on.

236
00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.359
So to see this sort of
little pool of California.

237
00:12:54.394 --> 00:12:59.019
this little bit of California onthe edge of Hornchurch in Essex

238
00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:02.816
in 1970s Britain. strikes
all sorts of chords

239
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:05.198
with me as a historian.

240
00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:09.098
And that's why the more I saw
it. the more I thought about

241
00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:10.065
it. the more I thought...

242
00:13:10.444 --> 00:13:13.654
This is an important place.
This has got to be preserved.

243
00:13:14.448 --> 00:13:15.553
It's special. you know.

244
00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.280
You go all over the world.
people know this place.

245
00:13:18.314 --> 00:13:21.421
And to have you on your doorstepis. yeah. it's a privilege.

246
00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:24.527
It was so well organised.

247
00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:26.184
You had to pay on entry.

248
00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:27.185
had a cafe.

249
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.635
had gaming machines.

250
00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.258
You had a shop. youknow. it had everything.

251
00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:33.605
And then you walkedinto the skate park

252
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.505
and it was just anoasis of a playground.

253
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.197
For bikes and skateboards

254
00:13:39.232 --> 00:13:42.062
and it's in Romford. seven miles from my house.

255
00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.070
Here we go. Here's Rom.

256
00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:52.245
So my memory is shot.

257
00:13:52.762 --> 00:13:54.730
So I actually might've
gotten knockout at Rom.

258
00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:58.285
We heard that they're
starting to have skate

259
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.908
parks around the world.

260
00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:01.841
I was like. I want to go.

261
00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.119
And my dad wanted to show
me some more museums. so

262
00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:05.154
we went on a little...

263
00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:08.675
excursion that was awesome.

264
00:14:09.296 --> 00:14:10.263
Trying to find these parks

265
00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:11.954
and skate them.

266
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:13.335
We fell in love with it.

267
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:16.372
My son went when he was older
and he was like. I belong here.

268
00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:17.891
I don't want to leave here.

269
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:20.445
Kind of was saying to me
like. you don't understand.

270
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.688
I was like. Oh. I understand.

271
00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:23.759
We did the same like.

272
00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:25.381
but because of skateboarding
I felt like I belonged

273
00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:26.417
there. but I'm living here.

274
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.005
It's Rom right here.

275
00:14:28.937 --> 00:14:30.800
Hornchurch. Essex.

276
00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:33.596
Simply the biggest and
the best. No question!

277
00:14:34.563 --> 00:14:35.598
Come see for yourself.

278
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.393
So I guess it is
the biggest one.

279
00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:38.498
Safety equipment for hire.

280
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:41.294
fully marshalled.

281
00:14:44.987 --> 00:14:46.092
first aid room.

282
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:49.198
pro shop. cafeteria. club room.

283
00:14:50.717 --> 00:14:51.856
amusement machines!

284
00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:55.964
80
Pence for two hours.

285
00:14:55.998 --> 00:14:57.034
80 Pence.

286
00:14:58.725 --> 00:14:59.760
Well there you go.

287
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:38.316
Well this place was originally
owned by a consortium

288
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:39.731
of oil wholesalers.

289
00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:41.354
They owned petrol garages. etc.

290
00:15:41.388 --> 00:15:44.598
They decided to build the Rom
skate park in the boom time

291
00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:46.393
when other big companies
were getting involved

292
00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:47.429
like Tate and Lyle.

293
00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:49.845
They thought there was
a fortune to be had.

294
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:52.744
And I used to come here coz
I used to wholesale skateboards

295
00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:55.195
because my brother builtthe first skate park in London.

296
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.128
which was Skate City.

297
00:15:57.163 --> 00:15:59.751
The word went out. you
can go and tip hardcore

298
00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:00.890
at London Bridge.

299
00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:03.445
So all the lorries in Londoninstead of going out to

300
00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:04.791
Bedfordshire to tip thier loads.

301
00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:07.863
would come into skate
city and tip their load

302
00:16:07.897 --> 00:16:09.416
and get bunged a few quid.

303
00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:12.143
So my brother was earning
thousands of pounds and

304
00:16:12.178 --> 00:16:13.489
made a great big hill.

305
00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:15.146
Then they concreted it
and everyone came down

306
00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:16.147
this hill like

307
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.323
Hit the bottom and
broke their arms.

308
00:16:22.084 --> 00:16:22.982
Couldn't stop!

309
00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:25.846
Oh this is good isnt it! Help!

310
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:28.263
I used to have a van and go
around the country selling

311
00:16:28.297 --> 00:16:29.850
skateboards to the shops.

312
00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:31.197
and this was one of my calls.

313
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:33.578
And I got friendly with the owner.

314
00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:35.235
and he said. "Do you
want to take it on?"

315
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.478
I said. "yeah. I'll take it on".

316
00:16:36.823 --> 00:16:38.998
I think the first day I
stood behind that counter.

317
00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.861
I took about £1.40.

318
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.691
It was disastrous.

319
00:16:42.725 --> 00:16:47.006
but we carried on. endeavoured ocarry on and it turned out okay.

320
00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:51.493
I used to have two Dobermans.

321
00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:54.289
We used to clear the
skate park at two o'clock.

322
00:16:54.737 --> 00:16:56.222
They'd run round and
get everybody out.

323
00:16:56.429 --> 00:16:57.809
Never bit anyone!

324
00:16:57.844 --> 00:16:59.604
They were just frightened ofthese Dobermans for some reason!

325
00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.710
They were always
under my control.

326
00:17:01.744 --> 00:17:06.025
But. that was just the story
that grew and grew. you know?

327
00:17:06.922 --> 00:17:08.061
Lovely when I think about it.

328
00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:10.857
I think I have. yeah.

329
00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.102
Big bad John. you know.

330
00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:19.866
Big John got this place in '78.it had been open six months.

331
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.316
It was going bankrupt.
it was going to shut.

332
00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:25.906
He walked in the door. sackedeveryone. took over. got his own

333
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:27.253
staff and he is still here now.

334
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:28.771
It's unheard of man.

335
00:17:28.806 --> 00:17:30.463
And he didn't even skateboardbig John. You know what I mean?

336
00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:31.774
Unheard of.

337
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:34.536
I mean it's been amazing whatthe Greenwood family have done

338
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.676
with that place over the years.

339
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.298
You know. all credit to
them sticking through it

340
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:39.541
through thick and thin.

341
00:17:39.989 --> 00:17:42.889
John and John. they deserve
medals for that.

342
00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:44.270
It's amazing what
they've done.

343
00:17:44.304 --> 00:17:49.068
I ran the skate park from
1978 until five years ago

344
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:50.586
when my son took it over.

345
00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:53.727
It's a testament to the
Greenwood family that

346
00:17:53.762 --> 00:17:54.970
have kept it going all
these years. you know.

347
00:17:55.004 --> 00:17:57.455
Its on it's arse at the
moment. as a business.

348
00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.560
but they still keep it going.

349
00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:00.389
I think they know how
important it is to people.

350
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:10.779
To be able to bring my kids
here now and for them to enjoy

351
00:18:10.813 --> 00:18:12.505
the same things that I did.

352
00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:14.093
and see it the same way.

353
00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:16.509
Yeah. that gives you
a really good feeling.

354
00:18:16.923 --> 00:18:18.994
It's not about
making money anymore.

355
00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:21.548
It's about my old man's
legacy for one.

356
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:23.032
He's done 30 years

357
00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:24.517
working there every day and it'slike be a shame just

358
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:25.621
to tear the place down.

359
00:18:25.656 --> 00:18:27.485
Like he obviously cared
about it or he wouldnt

360
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.728
have stayed for so long.

361
00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.937
John and his dad. they've
done an amazing job

362
00:18:30.971 --> 00:18:32.111
keeping this place going.

363
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:33.767
Cause there's been hard
times with those guys.

364
00:18:34.768 --> 00:18:36.839
It got to the point threemonths ago when I had

365
00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:38.358
minus £2.000 in my overdraft.

366
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.119
And that was it. game over.

367
00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.466
So literally... I'm on the edge.

368
00:18:54.754 --> 00:18:59.759
In English law. historic
buildings can be listed.

369
00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:02.624
That means they're protectedfor historic purposes.

370
00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:05.247
Grade 1 is St Paul's.

371
00:19:05.282 --> 00:19:08.181
You know. you can't even
breathe on that structure.

372
00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:10.632
without filling in a
form in triplicate and

373
00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:11.978
being denied six times.

374
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:15.154
Grade two is the most common

375
00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:18.950
and it basically means
that whatever is considered

376
00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:20.366
to be of historic value

377
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.818
cannot be altered or knocked
down without approval.

378
00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:26.786
Wow. so Rom can't be bulldozed?

379
00:19:27.062 --> 00:19:28.167
Oh. that's wonderful!

380
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:34.449
You can't really consider a
building for listing until

381
00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:36.313
it's about 30 years old.

382
00:19:36.658 --> 00:19:39.488
So skate parks for a start.
fit very much within

383
00:19:39.523 --> 00:19:41.283
that 1970's bracket.

384
00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:44.493
Simon Inglis at English
Heritage gave me a call

385
00:19:44.528 --> 00:19:47.979
and said. "We're
thinking of listing a

386
00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:50.189
skate park in England."

387
00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:53.330
"and we're thinking of
listing Harrow skate park."

388
00:19:53.537 --> 00:19:56.885
"So do you think this is
a good idea and

389
00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:58.404
have we got the
right skate park?"

390
00:19:58.438 --> 00:20:01.786
So I said. "Well. my
short answer is yes and no.

391
00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:05.031
Yes. it's a good idea. but also.you've got the wrong one".

392
00:20:10.347 --> 00:20:14.074
The first skate park that I wentto in my professional capacity

393
00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:16.732
was the Harrow skate park.

394
00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:18.734
A local authority skate park.

395
00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:23.049
from a historical and anwhich to me was very interesting

396
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:24.050
architectural point of view.

397
00:20:24.084 --> 00:20:27.812
because it had many
of the elements of a

398
00:20:27.847 --> 00:20:29.918
classic 1970s skate park.

399
00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:32.023
But it was clear to me
that there had been

400
00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:33.162
certain changes

401
00:20:33.197 --> 00:20:35.303
certain adaptations.
some of the bits had been

402
00:20:35.337 --> 00:20:36.338
filled in. and so on.

403
00:20:37.443 --> 00:20:39.168
My last trip. I remember
visiting the Harrow

404
00:20:39.203 --> 00:20:40.515
skate park which...

405
00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:44.139
Really. it was reminiscent of
when I started skating.

406
00:20:44.173 --> 00:20:46.037
And there were. you know. a handful of old

407
00:20:46.072 --> 00:20:47.142
'70s parks still around

408
00:20:47.176 --> 00:20:48.212
That was 1980.

409
00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:50.973
And that was my first
experience in skate parks and

410
00:20:51.008 --> 00:20:52.251
really with skateboarding.

411
00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:54.977
And so when I see one of
those spaces. you know. one of

412
00:20:55.012 --> 00:20:57.048
these sort of heritage spaces.

413
00:20:57.083 --> 00:21:00.293
it brings back a lot of memoriesand great feelings. you know.

414
00:21:00.535 --> 00:21:02.433
At that time skate parks
weren't perfect.

415
00:21:02.468 --> 00:21:03.192
but in a way like.

416
00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:06.644
you associated the
imperfections of the skate
park

417
00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:07.714
to part of his character.

418
00:21:07.749 --> 00:21:10.993
And of course talking
to skateboarding people.

419
00:21:11.028 --> 00:21:14.203
The words 'Rom skatepark'
come up repeatedly.

420
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.278
Romford to us. was we
travelled miles to come here.

421
00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:21.280
This is a Mecca for us.

422
00:21:21.728 --> 00:21:24.283
Coaches. buses. trains.

423
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.250
However we could get
here. we'd get here.

424
00:21:26.837 --> 00:21:29.288
So the key thing was to

425
00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:31.186
find examples of skate
park that were both

426
00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:36.467
interesting and well designed
and that had survived.

427
00:21:36.502 --> 00:21:37.710
And this was the
most important thing.

428
00:21:37.744 --> 00:21:39.367
that had survived intact.

429
00:21:39.574 --> 00:21:43.094
And the Rom skatepark
immediately came to the

430
00:21:43.129 --> 00:21:44.579
top of of that list.

431
00:21:45.062 --> 00:21:49.031
And the skate park of
course. is not a park in

432
00:21:49.066 --> 00:21:50.447
the conventional sense.

433
00:21:50.826 --> 00:21:54.002
but it's not a building
in the conventional sense.

434
00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:58.765
It's a bit of concrete
that follows the contours

435
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.974
of the designer's pattern.

436
00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:05.772
So in that sense. it is
truly a designed landscape.

437
00:22:06.635 --> 00:22:08.188
but it's built out of concrete.

438
00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:11.122
The people in charge of
designation of listing at

439
00:22:11.157 --> 00:22:12.261
English heritage

440
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.265
haven't really come across
anything like this before.

441
00:22:16.645 --> 00:22:18.440
You skate a park like this.
and it's not just about

442
00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:19.648
skating individual features.

443
00:22:19.683 --> 00:22:22.237
It's skating between them
and skating from one end to

444
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.997
the other and then moving
from one to the other.

445
00:22:24.032 --> 00:22:26.724
And you just build this
experience and

446
00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:28.554
probably every time you come here trying to mix up the order

447
00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:30.383
and you mix up the
direction you go in

448
00:22:30.418 --> 00:22:32.592
and you just. you know. if
you have a whole different

449
00:22:32.627 --> 00:22:33.628
experience every time.

450
00:22:33.662 --> 00:22:35.250
And you know. it's
just... it's just amazing.

451
00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:38.391
It's not a cathedral.
it's not a monastery.

452
00:22:38.978 --> 00:22:40.600
It's not a great house.

453
00:22:40.842 --> 00:22:43.569
It's about fun. It's
about recreation.

454
00:22:43.914 --> 00:22:47.573
So when I thought about
listing a skate park.

455
00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:50.161
I knew that I would be
testing the boundaries.

456
00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:53.130
Heritage is not about history.

457
00:22:53.924 --> 00:23:00.102
It's about what we consider tobe important about our history.

458
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:06.212
Clearly what we value about
our heritage now in the

459
00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:07.282
beginning of the 21st century

460
00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:11.182
is different to what
people valued

461
00:23:11.217 --> 00:23:14.462
in the fifties or the sixties orthe seventies and so on.

462
00:23:15.117 --> 00:23:17.879
It moves on as we move on.

463
00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:20.640
So coming here today was
kind of reminder.

464
00:23:20.675 --> 00:23:23.402
a throwback to when I was
younger and more energetic.

465
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:25.576
Kind of gave me that
thrill of when I first

466
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:26.612
started skating parks.

467
00:23:26.853 --> 00:23:28.130
back in... Way back when.

468
00:23:28.648 --> 00:23:32.134
And so when I proposed the
skate park for listing.

469
00:23:32.169 --> 00:23:35.655
just thinking this is going
to test the boundaries.

470
00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:38.417
but at the same time feeling.
no. this is important.

471
00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:40.936
This is a sport that was
established in the '70s.

472
00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:43.663
and has taken root in this
country.

473
00:23:45.182 --> 00:23:47.943
At the same time. I thought
this is going to be a battle.

474
00:23:48.703 --> 00:23:52.154
One is fighting battles the
whole time. uphill battles

475
00:23:52.189 --> 00:23:53.501
to preserve buildings

476
00:23:53.535 --> 00:23:56.642
and I'll be honest. we
lose more than we win.

477
00:23:56.849 --> 00:23:58.885
People see dollar signs.
probably flattening it

478
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.129
and turning into housing
or something like that.

479
00:24:01.163 --> 00:24:06.030
and so there's always this
sort of struggle to keep skate

480
00:24:06.065 --> 00:24:08.067
parks sort of alive really.

481
00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:13.624
At the same time we found that.of course. there were people

482
00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:14.729
working now for English Heritage

483
00:24:15.074 --> 00:24:17.594
who had skateboarded
in their youth.

484
00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:21.149
And instead of looking at
this proposal and saying

485
00:24:21.183 --> 00:24:24.842
"Come on guys. we can't do
this. there's going to be all

486
00:24:24.877 --> 00:24:26.775
sorts of opposition to this".

487
00:24:27.293 --> 00:24:29.778
They were saying
"Yeah. we get this."

488
00:24:31.193 --> 00:24:33.575
And that's the bottom
line really that BMX and

489
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.094
skateboarding and all these
places and going to Rom.

490
00:24:35.128 --> 00:24:36.544
it was about having
fun. you know.

491
00:24:36.578 --> 00:24:37.441
We were enjoying it.

492
00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:40.686
It's an amazing life to
to be able to do that.

493
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.654
To come here and have the
Mogul Bowls and have all

494
00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:44.966
the different concrete waves

495
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.865
and meet with these other
different skaters and be

496
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.073
influenced and inspired by

497
00:24:49.108 --> 00:24:51.213
the latest tricks. things
that were going on.

498
00:24:51.248 --> 00:24:52.456
The films that were coming out.

499
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.666
I mean Rom skatepark
really was a place where

500
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:56.598
dreams were made of

501
00:24:56.633 --> 00:24:58.427
if you were that age
and into skating.

502
00:25:11.544 --> 00:25:13.512
There are certain type
of people. they are.

503
00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.272
The Romblians I'll call them.

504
00:25:15.652 --> 00:25:18.344
Skate park communities
overall. is they're

505
00:25:18.378 --> 00:25:19.103
largely without class.

506
00:25:19.138 --> 00:25:20.760
largely without racism.

507
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.382
bigotry and so forth.

508
00:25:22.417 --> 00:25:24.350
There's not a lot of
that inside a skate park.

509
00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:27.008
Because we tend to find that
our priorities are different.

510
00:25:27.387 --> 00:25:29.355
The priorities tend to be.

511
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:32.634
people are much more
interested in keeping their

512
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:34.567
bones inside of their skin.

513
00:25:34.602 --> 00:25:37.225
and their teeth inside of theirmouth. Rather than leaving

514
00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:38.675
them on the bottom of the ramp.

515
00:25:38.985 --> 00:25:40.228
They like rough surface.

516
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.783
That's all I can say.

517
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:45.820
You know. this
place is a predator.

518
00:25:45.854 --> 00:25:47.166
The Skate park is your predator.

519
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:49.202
And you're the pray. man.

520
00:25:49.237 --> 00:25:50.721
and some days it'll
let you get away of it.

521
00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.759
Other days it will chew
you up and spit you out.

522
00:25:54.104 --> 00:25:56.175
And you've got to
be scared of it.

523
00:25:56.382 --> 00:25:58.177
If you come here and you're notscared of it. you're an idiot.

524
00:25:58.522 --> 00:25:59.558
Because you're
going to get hurt.

525
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:06.461
'Rom Rash'

526
00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:07.876
I don't know what it was like
back in the day.

527
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:09.429
It must've been a lot
smoother back then.

528
00:26:09.464 --> 00:26:11.328
If you go down at Rom.
you stay down down.

529
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:23.582
Soon as you look out the
door. there's a pool.

530
00:26:24.203 --> 00:26:25.929
Jesus Christ. look
at that. you know.

531
00:26:27.206 --> 00:26:29.380
You know. you go in and you
think. right i'm just going to

532
00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:32.245
go in there easy today cause I
know it took a lot of victims.

533
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.971
They always do. pools.

534
00:26:34.006 --> 00:26:35.145
You lose yourself.
It's like a madness.

535
00:26:35.835 --> 00:26:37.768
You just go in there and
just fighting these walls.

536
00:26:37.803 --> 00:26:39.252
And just think.
oh i'll have you.

537
00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:41.634
In your head. you just feel
I had to do that to you.

538
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:44.775
You know. it was like it
gets personal when you're

539
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:45.845
in these pools. you know.

540
00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:50.022
Just want to rip them up a bit
and get your 'Ugh' out of you.

541
00:26:52.162 --> 00:26:54.509
People always go in
thinking they'll rip the
shit out of them. you know.

542
00:26:54.543 --> 00:26:58.133
It basically it backfires on
them. somewhere along the line.

543
00:27:02.068 --> 00:27:04.830
In the pool. I broke my wristwhen I was about twelve in '87.

544
00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:07.142
Compound breaks -
Bones sticking out.

545
00:27:07.384 --> 00:27:08.557
Face first into the ramp.

546
00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:10.111
his teeth literally
popped up on the deck.

547
00:27:10.318 --> 00:27:12.596
No 'Hampsteads'eleven years later.

548
00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:14.667
Knocked myself out.
knocked my teeth out.

549
00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:16.255
I've had nine knee surgeries.

550
00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:19.258
Broke my hand. broke
my elbow and foot.

551
00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:21.778
I've got severe
arthritis in both knees.

552
00:27:22.088 --> 00:27:23.642
Heart! On many occasions.

553
00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:26.058
It doesn't stop me riding
unless I ride three or

554
00:27:26.092 --> 00:27:28.577
four times a week and then
I'm hobbling everywhere.

555
00:27:28.888 --> 00:27:30.649
If you come to a place
like this and you get on

556
00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:32.858
a bike or a skateboard.
you've got one in the post.

557
00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:35.654
If you're scared of it.
that's when it's gonna happen

558
00:27:35.688 --> 00:27:37.276
and you shouldn't be here.

559
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.174
You gotta have a bit of a
kamikaze way about you and

560
00:27:39.209 --> 00:27:41.176
in you. to want to do it and
not be scared of slamming.

561
00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:42.937
When you relax it don't
happen as much you know.

562
00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:43.765
And even if it does...

563
00:27:44.697 --> 00:27:45.491
Tough shit.

564
00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:46.526
Brush yourself off. try again.

565
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:50.323
If I've been hurt and I can't
skate for a couple of weeks.

566
00:27:50.358 --> 00:27:51.324
It's so frustrating.

567
00:27:51.704 --> 00:27:55.328
My wife will tell me. "For fucksake. Go and skate. Go to Rom".

568
00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:07.893
When I left school. worked at
Halfords. nicked a few stereos.

569
00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:10.343
I want to work in a skate park.

570
00:28:10.619 --> 00:28:11.690
It's not a proper job.

571
00:28:12.414 --> 00:28:13.312
What's a proper job?

572
00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:16.487
Like what? Grow up and
be an adult. Fuck that.

573
00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:18.524
I didn't want to grow up.
I wanted to be Peter Pan.

574
00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:20.112
and this was Never Never Land.

575
00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:21.700
And still is.

576
00:28:24.254 --> 00:28:27.706
There was a family vibe to
it. Endless days of skating

577
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.603
and it didn't cost...

578
00:28:28.983 --> 00:28:31.088
All it cost you as a pot
noodle and a couple of Cherry

579
00:28:31.123 --> 00:28:32.158
Cokes really wasn't it?

580
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.126
So there was that little bit
of one-upmanship. you know.

581
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.095
Who could do the best
trick with the best poise.

582
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.718
elegance and dexterity?

583
00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:42.168
Dressed in the best
clothing. you know. with

584
00:28:42.203 --> 00:28:44.308
The best floppy-ist fringed
hair cut you could have

585
00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:45.793
got at the time as well.

586
00:28:47.035 --> 00:28:50.038
Romford has been my local.
yeah. for 35 years. like

587
00:28:50.073 --> 00:28:50.970
my entire adult life.

588
00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:53.904
You know. and all my teenage
years.

589
00:28:53.939 --> 00:28:55.941
Romford was the place that I
always wanted to come to

590
00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:56.976
no matter what.

591
00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:00.911
I don't know what it
is about Romford.

592
00:29:00.946 --> 00:29:01.912
It's just. I
don't know.

593
00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:04.328
Like you know. I'll have my
ashes scattered here probably.

594
00:29:04.363 --> 00:29:09.299
It's one of those places. It's
just part of who I am really.

595
00:29:11.404 --> 00:29:12.923
I couldn't drive past
here and not come in.

596
00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:14.131
I don't think my
car would let me.

597
00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:15.961
I would have to go
the long way round.

598
00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:18.929
I'd be fighting
the steering wheel!

599
00:29:18.964 --> 00:29:20.206
I love the place.

600
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:22.381
I don't know what I would have
done if it wasn't for Rom.

601
00:29:22.968 --> 00:29:23.969
I really don't.

602
00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:26.972
Lot of the people I work
with and associated with.

603
00:29:27.006 --> 00:29:28.490
were up to no good
lot of the time.

604
00:29:28.525 --> 00:29:30.009
I think I would have found
myself dragged into that.

605
00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:31.597
It's kept me on the
straight and narrow really.

606
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:32.805
It really did. you know.

607
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.634
I've the best and the worst
days of my life over here.

608
00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:39.225
We were pretty poor.

609
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.951
I remember coming over
here in my P.E shorts and

610
00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:41.987
Georgie Best's football boots.

611
00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:45.197
But. yeah... Rom!

612
00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:46.543
This is home.

613
00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:48.959
It's not like. Oh.
this is my second home.

614
00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:51.962
This is my first home
and has been forever.

615
00:29:51.997 --> 00:29:54.171
You build up a family.
There's a community.

616
00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:55.345
I lost my mom young...

617
00:29:56.035 --> 00:29:58.175
And remember the day I lost
her. the first thing I'd done.

618
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.523
two hours after her dying in
the hospital. was come here.

619
00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:03.422
And everyone's like.
why is he here?

620
00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:04.595
Where else could you go?

621
00:30:05.182 --> 00:30:08.013
I didn't want to be at home
with my family. I wanted
to be here with my family.

622
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:10.049
Because people just kind
of let you get on with it.

623
00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:12.396
He asked me. he said.
"You got any photographs

624
00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:13.190
and things like that?"

625
00:30:13.225 --> 00:30:15.434
I said "Yeah some old photos".

626
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:18.678
I thought it was going to be abirthday surprise or something.

627
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.130
He's come in one day with
this big tattoo on his leg

628
00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:24.063
So I was flabbergasted
when I saw it.

629
00:30:26.548 --> 00:30:28.757
I thought it was... Weird.

630
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.345
And strange to have it done.

631
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.348
But love and affection to him.
He bares his soul. doesn't he.

632
00:30:33.383 --> 00:30:34.522
It's love and affection.

633
00:30:34.556 --> 00:30:36.558
You can be you and
you're accepted for it.

634
00:30:36.593 --> 00:30:38.629
which is the beautiful
subculture of BMX.

635
00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:40.252
skateboarding. skating whatever.

636
00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:42.944
You kind of. it's
come one come all.

637
00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:45.429
There's less judgemental
people at a skate park

638
00:30:45.464 --> 00:30:46.499
than there is in a church.

639
00:30:46.534 --> 00:30:48.881
It teaches kids
everything in life.

640
00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:51.263
It teaches them. if you want
something. you have to

641
00:30:51.297 --> 00:30:52.333
work towards a goal.

642
00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:55.267
It embeds a life philosophy in
children that you can't buy.

643
00:30:56.578 --> 00:31:00.755
The era that grew up in
skateparks have that thing

644
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:02.550
about their skatepark.

645
00:31:03.378 --> 00:31:06.865
And it's... You can't shake it.

646
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.558
Guys I know from Rom.
I've known my whole life.

647
00:31:10.834 --> 00:31:13.147
Me and my wife been together
eight. nine years now.

648
00:31:13.699 --> 00:31:16.322
We actually met through this.Wemet through her daughter.

649
00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:18.393
her youngest daughter.Charlotte came over here.

650
00:31:18.428 --> 00:31:19.429
started skating with us.

651
00:31:19.774 --> 00:31:20.948
It's actually how I met her!

652
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.952
Rom was a real mixture ofdifferent types of people.

653
00:31:24.986 --> 00:31:28.990
But they were pretty...
I'd say peaceful if

654
00:31:29.025 --> 00:31:30.026
you. like. you know.

655
00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:32.131
Pretty rad as well.

656
00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:33.822
Some guys there that
could just skate.

657
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.790
Yeah my first time I
come down Rom...

658
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.758
And there was a guy in
the tiniest velvet shorts.

659
00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:40.312
Skating the pool
and that was it.

660
00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:42.417
Ragging around the
pool. front-side grinds.

661
00:31:42.452 --> 00:31:43.384
No one else there man.

662
00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:44.523
Beautiful.

663
00:31:45.973 --> 00:31:47.112
Absolutely amazing.

664
00:31:47.388 --> 00:31:48.527
It must have been Graham.

665
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:51.737
It's the only thing I can say.it's got to have been Graham.

666
00:31:54.602 --> 00:31:56.811
Graham's unique. he's
got his own style.

667
00:31:56.845 --> 00:32:00.573
He's got a very surfy style
skater. which I like.

668
00:32:00.884 --> 00:32:03.093
You know. that kind of
old school skating

669
00:32:03.128 --> 00:32:06.545
is hard to replicate unless
it comes naturally.

670
00:32:06.786 --> 00:32:09.375
It took me a little while to getused to his sarcasm. I think.

671
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.101
But everyone knows about
that. His little rants.

672
00:32:11.136 --> 00:32:12.413
you know what I mean?

673
00:32:15.416 --> 00:32:18.143
The main thing I know aboutDion is that he's always at Rom.

674
00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:21.870
I don't think I've ever been
at Rom when Dion isn't there.

675
00:32:22.595 --> 00:32:25.771
He's in there. I mean.
he's already defining

676
00:32:25.805 --> 00:32:28.912
so many things. you know. causeyou know. he had a bad accident.

677
00:32:30.155 --> 00:32:33.537
I fell off a scaffold. broke
my ankle. knee and hip.

678
00:32:33.572 --> 00:32:35.401
I was off work about 18 months.

679
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:37.334
I was registered disabledfor a while.

680
00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:39.060
They told me I'd probably never
going to walk without stick.

681
00:32:39.095 --> 00:32:42.236
And say. probably in 10 years
you're probably be in a chair.

682
00:32:42.581 --> 00:32:44.583
17 years later. I'm
still going strong.

683
00:32:44.617 --> 00:32:45.480
so I proved them wrong.

684
00:32:45.894 --> 00:32:47.068
He's grinding
that pool and that.

685
00:32:47.103 --> 00:32:48.932
It's actually unbelievable.

686
00:32:49.277 --> 00:32:50.969
You know. that is a
story on it's own.

687
00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:55.249
You know. some people
call it like a midlife

688
00:32:55.283 --> 00:32:56.422
crisis don't they?

689
00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:58.010
You know what I mean?

690
00:32:58.045 --> 00:32:59.598
You're either... Some people
are unfaithful aren't they?

691
00:32:59.943 --> 00:33:04.223
You know with me. I think itwas back to the boys with toys.

692
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:09.401
You know. I've been a father.
I'm been working for all these
years.

693
00:33:09.677 --> 00:33:10.678
putting on weight.

694
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.300
I was in a sales job.

695
00:33:13.405 --> 00:33:14.958
and. you know. growing
a family and that.

696
00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:18.168
I never really had much of an
outlet after that. hobby wise.

697
00:33:18.203 --> 00:33:21.033
Once I had given up the
pubs and the clubs. and
the raving and all that.

698
00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:22.241
It you know what I mean.

699
00:33:22.276 --> 00:33:24.726
I had a lump in the
side of my face here.

700
00:33:24.761 --> 00:33:29.041
I went up there to the hospitaland they told me. yeah. you

701
00:33:29.076 --> 00:33:30.629
have got Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

702
00:33:30.663 --> 00:33:32.217
which is like a really bad one.

703
00:33:33.252 --> 00:33:36.221
Obviously. I was quite upset
when I was told that but.

704
00:33:36.255 --> 00:33:37.670
mainly thought of my
kids to be honest.

705
00:33:37.705 --> 00:33:40.432
You know you do. don't you.
when you hear bad news.

706
00:33:42.848 --> 00:33:45.851
Got fixed after that time and
just ended up with a big

707
00:33:45.885 --> 00:33:48.336
'Mars Bar' down the
back of my face.

708
00:33:49.268 --> 00:33:51.098
And I thought. you know. I've
got to try and live again.

709
00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:54.618
Yeah. when growing up
and everything and I was

710
00:33:54.653 --> 00:33:55.412
an angry kid. you know.

711
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.621
All the boys I rode with back
in the day. you know. I'd

712
00:33:57.656 --> 00:33:58.657
be like throwing my bike...

713
00:33:58.691 --> 00:34:00.486
F you. F this. F
that and everything.

714
00:34:00.521 --> 00:34:01.867
So angry at the world.

715
00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:05.491
I'd been adopted. I'd
been nurtured. I'd been

716
00:34:05.526 --> 00:34:06.527
given love and affection.

717
00:34:06.768 --> 00:34:09.288
But I still had
this rage inside me.

718
00:34:09.323 --> 00:34:11.152
We were just running around
lawless.

719
00:34:11.187 --> 00:34:14.328
but we wasn't
horrible little fuckers at

720
00:34:14.362 --> 00:34:16.054
the same times. you know.

721
00:34:17.262 --> 00:34:19.643
We'd grown up in a
Thatcherite Britain

722
00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:22.784
and what Thatcher taught us was
you be the best you can be...

723
00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:25.684
But use everyone beneath
you as a stepladder.

724
00:34:26.305 --> 00:34:29.377
I had sort of associated
skateboarding with being very

725
00:34:29.412 --> 00:34:34.313
noisy and to certain extent
sort of quite them and us.

726
00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.696
I was nice and I was
white and I was polite.

727
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.285
I was described as like thetriple threat.

728
00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:42.252
Hold my hands up. I was
a bloody good shoplifter

729
00:34:42.287 --> 00:34:43.115
when I was a kid.

730
00:34:43.357 --> 00:34:44.841
And that's how I earned
extra pocket money.

731
00:34:45.255 --> 00:34:47.395
People wouldn't even
turn their heads and

732
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:48.431
look at ya. you know so.

733
00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:49.811
Well... Yeah.

734
00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.540
There is very much a sort of
sense that they come from a

735
00:34:54.575 --> 00:34:58.820
subculture of which you as a
passer-by can't really enter.

736
00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:04.757
I'm a 58 year old.
born again skater.

737
00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:07.898
There's a whole fraternity out
there of people of varying

738
00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:08.934
ages. It's okay to skate.

739
00:35:08.968 --> 00:35:10.832
And that's what I really
like about this place.

740
00:35:11.143 --> 00:35:13.732
It's a big mix of people.
It's a very large college

741
00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:14.767
if you like. of individuals.

742
00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:16.735
Very eclectic group.

743
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.979
Oh. like a family community
of like Rom and all the

744
00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:21.360
locals who come here.

745
00:35:23.431 --> 00:35:24.812
More than friends. really.

746
00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:28.540
You get people from all
backgrounds and walks

747
00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:29.610
of life who do it.

748
00:35:29.886 --> 00:35:33.614
Right now I'm in media. so I
do a lot of video production.

749
00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:37.859
events and we also have
film studios in Las Vegas.

750
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.552
So I'm a contracts manager
now. and I'll deal with

751
00:35:40.586 --> 00:35:41.346
scaffolders all day.

752
00:35:42.312 --> 00:35:44.072
A lot of them are like cavemen.
They've got no understanding

753
00:35:44.107 --> 00:35:45.557
or appreciation for
anything like that.

754
00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:48.525
I'm a carer. I do one to
one care for disabled and

755
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.388
mentally handicapped people.

756
00:35:49.837 --> 00:35:53.185
I'm a senior examiner for
the Civil Aviation Authority.

757
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.326
So I'm flying the
Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

758
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:59.398
Full time occupation.
nine to five Mac engineer.

759
00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:02.401
Nonetheless. there's this
idea that what you do outside

760
00:36:02.436 --> 00:36:03.575
of your job

761
00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:07.234
is compensation for the things
that you put up with

762
00:36:07.268 --> 00:36:08.269
within your job.

763
00:36:08.994 --> 00:36:13.481
Where I give so much of myselfto my job and the people I've

764
00:36:13.516 --> 00:36:14.827
worked for. and support I give.

765
00:36:15.552 --> 00:36:18.659
There has got to be a
point where I've got

766
00:36:18.693 --> 00:36:20.385
to become myself again.

767
00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:23.077
I thought it would be nice
to just dabble and have

768
00:36:23.111 --> 00:36:24.147
a skate now and again.

769
00:36:24.458 --> 00:36:26.908
but it's not like that. It getsunder your skin before you know

770
00:36:26.943 --> 00:36:27.978
it. you're hooked ain't you?

771
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.602
You know. I'm over here mostdays. I can't help it. you know.

772
00:36:31.258 --> 00:36:33.191
I'll pull up on a job andopen my boot up and my

773
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:34.053
skateboard's always there

774
00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:35.331
You know. I take it wherever
I go.

775
00:36:36.055 --> 00:36:37.195
"What the bloody hells that?"

776
00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:38.506
It's a skateboard!

777
00:36:38.541 --> 00:36:40.059
"Oh! What are you going to get
for Christmas? An Action Man?"

778
00:36:42.683 --> 00:36:45.030
[Look out all these
fantastic uniforms specially

779
00:36:45.064 --> 00:36:46.721
designed for Action Man].

780
00:36:49.552 --> 00:36:51.036
Really taking the piss. you know!

781
00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:53.418
I'm like whatever... I
don't even try and defend it

782
00:36:53.452 --> 00:36:54.488
anymore. It's just like...

783
00:36:54.902 --> 00:36:58.319
The chap from English Heritage.one of their buildings inspectors.

784
00:36:58.354 --> 00:37:01.391
And I just noticed there was a Rom skatepark sticker

785
00:37:01.426 --> 00:37:02.427
on his guitar case.

786
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:04.291
And he said. "Oh yeah.
it's great. isn't it?"

787
00:37:05.637 --> 00:37:07.501
And this is the guy whospends hours looking around

788
00:37:07.535 --> 00:37:10.711
archaeological sites and lookingold cathedrals and things.

789
00:37:10.918 --> 00:37:12.022
It is mainstream.

790
00:37:12.057 --> 00:37:14.646
And that's certainly. I think
that's certainly

791
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.612
the case with
skateboarding

792
00:37:15.647 --> 00:37:17.718
and the whole
kind of creativity of it.

793
00:37:17.994 --> 00:37:21.273
You know. people make films.
they do photography.

794
00:37:21.308 --> 00:37:24.690
they do tattoos. they make
boards.

795
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:26.174
they run board
companies.

796
00:37:26.623 --> 00:37:30.282
You know. often alongside
their kind of regular jobs.

797
00:37:30.317 --> 00:37:34.044
So it's not just skateboardingitself. it's the creative stuff

798
00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:37.634
that goes with skateboardingas well that attracts people.

799
00:37:37.669 --> 00:37:39.671
You know. someone
like Monkeyglove Matt.

800
00:37:39.705 --> 00:37:42.743
No idea what he does for his
day job.

801
00:37:42.777 --> 00:37:45.470
but he takes really great
pictures and

802
00:37:45.504 --> 00:37:46.540
a lot of them at Rom.

803
00:37:46.885 --> 00:37:49.888
So for him. part of presumably
the attraction of skateboarding

804
00:37:49.922 --> 00:37:55.100
is not just the skateboarding
itself. but the photography
around it.

805
00:37:55.134 --> 00:37:58.103
What I really enjoy about it isthat it's capturing that moment.

806
00:37:58.137 --> 00:38:00.519
I almost want to look throughlens. I kind of want toget in there

807
00:38:00.554 --> 00:38:02.901
and I have been hit
a couple of times.

808
00:38:03.177 --> 00:38:05.110
which strangely enough.
in a weird way I enjoy.

809
00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:07.388
So there's also a bit of a
sadomasochistic element to it.

810
00:38:07.423 --> 00:38:09.528
But I guess it's part of.
for me.

811
00:38:09.563 --> 00:38:12.669
it's the skater getting
that trick. landing that

812
00:38:12.704 --> 00:38:16.052
trick and being able to just
capture that moment for them.

813
00:38:16.328 --> 00:38:19.055
is something that I
just really enjoy.

814
00:38:22.403 --> 00:38:24.957
Skateboarding now. it's got
quite a strong identity.

815
00:38:24.992 --> 00:38:28.340
It didn't then. you brought
Dunlop green flash or baseball

816
00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:29.203
boots from Woolworths.

817
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.895
That's what you skated in
you because we could only

818
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.172
dream of Vans. you know.

819
00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:36.141
That skate world is sort
of. really kind of dictated

820
00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:37.245
whole sneaker culture

821
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.041
and streetwear. street
fashion. from sneakers to

822
00:38:40.076 --> 00:38:42.596
graffiti. and to a certain
extent. even a lot of music.

823
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:47.325
has been influenced by that
kind of freedom of expression

824
00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:48.395
that skateboarding is.

825
00:38:48.636 --> 00:38:50.983
It's a massive thing. isn't
it? There's a music culture.

826
00:38:51.018 --> 00:38:53.400
there's a fashion. there's
a language. there's lots of

827
00:38:53.434 --> 00:38:56.334
aspects to skateboarding.

828
00:38:59.544 --> 00:39:03.133
Well. this weekend we have
the unique experience of the

829
00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:06.930
20th anniversary of the first
piece that was done here at

830
00:39:06.965 --> 00:39:07.759
the Lakeside hall of fame.

831
00:39:07.793 --> 00:39:09.795
also known as the concrete gallery.

832
00:39:10.002 --> 00:39:13.558
The first piece was done
in August. 1999 by myself.

833
00:39:14.213 --> 00:39:18.977
Been heavily involved in the
English graffiti scene since
1983.

834
00:39:20.116 --> 00:39:24.258
Been a massive collector of
anything 1980s from clothing

835
00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:25.293
to BMX bikes to music.

836
00:39:27.192 --> 00:39:29.850
I get involved. I like
to get involved. Yeah.

837
00:39:29.884 --> 00:39:32.128
I'm all or nothing. I'm
all or nothing. Yeah.

838
00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:36.374
There's a strong bond betweenart and music.

839
00:39:36.408 --> 00:39:38.686
It's like a stick of rock. It
runs straight through
the middle.

840
00:39:38.721 --> 00:39:42.380
You know. Ted Nugent.
Led Zepplin and it
was like

841
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.176
Blondie and Devo and it
was like wow. And it was

842
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:48.558
like. this is our thing.

843
00:39:48.593 --> 00:39:51.768
Skateboarding said this was
our thing and skate parks. all

844
00:39:51.803 --> 00:39:53.667
it did was blast that music.

845
00:39:56.635 --> 00:40:00.881
I think it's a really great
match with skateboarding. art.

846
00:40:00.915 --> 00:40:02.434
street art. skateboarding.

847
00:40:02.469 --> 00:40:05.333
and the whole ethos of
skateboarding. The do it

848
00:40:05.368 --> 00:40:06.196
yourself thing.

849
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:07.474
graphics on the bottom
of boards.

850
00:40:07.508 --> 00:40:10.546
I think it's a really nice thingthat works together. You know.

851
00:40:12.548 --> 00:40:15.792
I think skateboarding really
is like a school of hard knocks

852
00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:16.828
and you've got to try. try. try.

853
00:40:16.862 --> 00:40:19.140
You keep getting battered
into the ground until

854
00:40:19.175 --> 00:40:20.176
you get it right.

855
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.213
And that is a perfect
preparation for doing

856
00:40:23.248 --> 00:40:24.249
a piece like this.

857
00:40:24.594 --> 00:40:27.355
You know. there was always
a real divide of being

858
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.218
outside and inside

859
00:40:28.253 --> 00:40:30.151
and the barrier of the fence.

860
00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:33.603
I guess the fence is a real.
not so much an inspiration.

861
00:40:33.638 --> 00:40:36.019
but it's a really big bit of
Rom. you know. that divide

862
00:40:36.054 --> 00:40:37.227
from being outside to inside.

863
00:40:37.262 --> 00:40:40.610
And then getting in and havingall this geometry to kind of

864
00:40:40.645 --> 00:40:44.338
discover to be able to carveyour own lines for it. you know.

865
00:40:45.512 --> 00:40:50.068
Freestyle it. free flow aroundthis structure. You know.

866
00:40:50.102 --> 00:40:52.450
that's what really inspiredthe piece.

867
00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:57.247
I have always been an
artist. always painted as

868
00:40:57.282 --> 00:40:58.421
a kid like every kid does.

869
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:01.528
It wasn't until I started
skating I became aware of

870
00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:02.977
graffiti and street art.

871
00:41:03.012 --> 00:41:05.290
And that kind of

872
00:41:05.324 --> 00:41:08.466
alternative art scene with like graphics for skateboards and stuff like that.

873
00:41:09.156 --> 00:41:10.951
Yeah. I think they're
completely linked.

874
00:41:10.985 --> 00:41:13.850
I started skating when I was
about like 10/11 years old

875
00:41:13.885 --> 00:41:15.749
and we used. back then we
had no skate parks where I'm

876
00:41:15.783 --> 00:41:16.888
originally from in Cambridge.

877
00:41:17.233 --> 00:41:20.063
So we used to travel around EastAnglia. London. Essex

878
00:41:20.098 --> 00:41:21.513
and go to the skate parksand I remember

879
00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:23.964
my mum bringing me here when Iwas probably about 13 years old.

880
00:41:23.998 --> 00:41:26.518
Yeah. it was pretty
intimidating when you're a

881
00:41:26.553 --> 00:41:27.795
kid. this place. you know.

882
00:41:35.113 --> 00:41:37.736
My first childhood memory is
my dad throwing me in a fire.

883
00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.982
And then at seven years old
my dad is beating my mum up.

884
00:41:42.016 --> 00:41:46.089
I ran in with a kitchen knife tostab my dad to protect my mum.

885
00:41:46.124 --> 00:41:48.609
The police and social worker
turned up at school and says.

886
00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:51.129
we heard what happened last
night. You're coming with us.

887
00:41:51.163 --> 00:41:54.684
That was the 24th of December.
1979

888
00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:55.996
Christmas Eve. I got locked up.

889
00:41:56.203 --> 00:41:59.309
I was brought up to. you know.honestly I was a little racist.

890
00:41:59.344 --> 00:42:02.036
The area I grew up in.
there was no black kids.

891
00:42:02.278 --> 00:42:04.970
I meet my foster parents
and my dad's black.

892
00:42:07.594 --> 00:42:09.527
I used to walk like six
metres behind him because

893
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:11.149
I was so embarrassed with
the colour of his skin.

894
00:42:11.183 --> 00:42:13.185
35 years later. he's still my dad.

895
00:42:17.776 --> 00:42:21.262
In BMX. I would say 99.9%
of BMX riders went through

896
00:42:21.297 --> 00:42:22.298
tough times.

897
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:24.783
And same with skateboarders.
Same with people that

898
00:42:24.818 --> 00:42:26.164
came to this skate park.

899
00:42:26.405 --> 00:42:28.338
They all came here because
this was a sanctuary

900
00:42:28.373 --> 00:42:30.030
and so that's what it's about.

901
00:42:30.306 --> 00:42:33.136
It's not about where you
came from. It was about being

902
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:35.829
in the moment riding that
bowl. riding the skate park.

903
00:42:36.312 --> 00:42:39.384
And that's when you can let it
all go because you're present.

904
00:42:39.418 --> 00:42:40.834
It's our meditation. really.

905
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:44.665
So many people I was around
had similar backgrounds.

906
00:42:45.114 --> 00:42:49.152
I really did turn all the
negative energy ito into
positivity.

907
00:42:49.187 --> 00:42:52.397
I mean it's an art form when
you're skating or bike riding.

908
00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.918
#seratonin#

909
00:42:57.436 --> 00:43:00.301
#swimming around my head#

910
00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:03.270
#seratonin#

911
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:07.861
#love this pool#

912
00:43:08.793 --> 00:43:11.140
#How am I coping?#

913
00:43:11.865 --> 00:43:15.420
#with the tiles and no water#

914
00:43:16.904 --> 00:43:20.287
Skateboarders are generally.
not the outcast. but maybe

915
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:27.087
they don't fit in with
the normal kind of sport.

916
00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:29.848
I'd like to say it was weirdos.at first.

917
00:43:30.331 --> 00:43:31.332
It was weirdos.

918
00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:36.027
Skateboarding is seriously
funny. I mean a lot of

919
00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:37.925
is escapism. you know.

920
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.549
Like just that feeling where
you're like. you had all

921
00:43:41.584 --> 00:43:43.344
these things you could do.

922
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:45.036
I think it can be bad
and it can be good.

923
00:43:45.312 --> 00:43:47.625
So I don't escape completely.
I know it's a joke.

924
00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:50.800
I know it's for the
entertainment to

925
00:43:50.835 --> 00:43:53.596
entertain yourself.
That's part of it too.

926
00:43:55.046 --> 00:43:56.634
It's something where
you do it for yourself.

927
00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:58.636
That's what I love about skating. There's no rules.

928
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.430
nothing you have to achieve.

929
00:44:00.465 --> 00:44:01.639
It's just personal.

930
00:44:05.712 --> 00:44:08.818
Maybe that's why it attracts
people of a certain type.

931
00:44:08.853 --> 00:44:14.686
who don't fit into society's.
you know. view of normality.

932
00:44:15.066 --> 00:44:16.343
whatever that may be.

933
00:44:16.377 --> 00:44:18.138
More entertaining yourself.

934
00:44:18.172 --> 00:44:23.212
Like you do stupid things andyou see like people react like.

935
00:44:23.384 --> 00:44:26.111
Oh this guy is such a
loser. And you're like.

936
00:44:26.146 --> 00:44:29.011
Oh that's great. They think
I'm a loser. It's so rad.

937
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.704
Like. it's great. This
might be British.

938
00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:35.051
I don't know. Or it might just
be childhood. like

939
00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:36.984
weird things I haven't dealt
with.

940
00:44:40.988 --> 00:44:44.474
My name is Brent Lewis and I'm
the CEO of The Far Academy.

941
00:44:46.304 --> 00:44:48.375
We're an alternative educationprovision.

942
00:44:48.409 --> 00:44:51.171
So we work with kids throughoutthe UK. But generally kids

943
00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:54.036
who are not engagedin education or vulnerable kids.

944
00:44:54.381 --> 00:44:57.315
And then we'll use
skateboarding

945
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:59.593
as the educational tool to get
the qualifications that they
need.

946
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.872
So yeah. the memories here
is incredible and. it's

947
00:45:02.907 --> 00:45:06.911
so raw as well that's what
we like about it.

948
00:45:07.877 --> 00:45:10.500
And the kids generally
will go to timber parks and

949
00:45:10.535 --> 00:45:12.502
those crappy council ones.

950
00:45:12.537 --> 00:45:16.092
This one is... They're blown
away. They completely...

951
00:45:16.127 --> 00:45:19.061
They're out of their comfort
zone and it pushes them.

952
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.340
And I think. well how can Ihit that line? And they're doing

953
00:45:22.374 --> 00:45:24.342
completely different lines whatthey ever thought they could.

954
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:26.654
So yeah. it's an amazing place to be.

955
00:45:26.896 --> 00:45:30.141
Kids get into skateboarding andBMX when they can't necessarily

956
00:45:30.175 --> 00:45:31.211
get into other things.

957
00:45:31.245 --> 00:45:33.213
And they get led into this
kind of sport

958
00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:35.905
and I think they wouldn't have
any kind of form of

959
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.736
expression without
this park and these sports.

960
00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:43.671
This is what I think is super
important about skateboarding

961
00:45:43.706 --> 00:45:49.091
is it's given an avenue for kidsto find themselves on their own.

962
00:45:49.608 --> 00:45:53.026
And for some kids they find
all the things that organised

963
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.373
sports are supposed to design.

964
00:45:56.063 --> 00:45:59.411
They find those things
and find other things on
their own in a better way.

965
00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:04.347
They find how to learn and
fall. stick at something and

966
00:46:04.382 --> 00:46:05.866
be passionate about something.

967
00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:10.077
And in doing so. they learn allthese other skills accidentally.

968
00:46:10.112 --> 00:46:13.184
It's unbelievable how many
skateboarders

969
00:46:13.218 --> 00:46:15.082
turn into and
develop into

970
00:46:15.117 --> 00:46:19.397
pieces of society without
any real schooling.

971
00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:24.643
Skateboarding itself schooled
them. figuring things out on

972
00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:26.611
their own. developing things.designing things. making things.

973
00:46:26.645 --> 00:46:29.614
using their brain in a way
that developing thought

974
00:46:29.648 --> 00:46:30.477
that isn't just taught.

975
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.276
Skateboarding is like pretty oneof the most important athletic

976
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.795
things that develop character.

977
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:40.418
I think it's different typesof character. There's a freedom

978
00:46:40.452 --> 00:46:41.557
to it. which can be dangerous.

979
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:45.250
but there's also a very much
self-willed get it done.

980
00:46:45.285 --> 00:46:48.495
figure it out. do it yourself.
which is super important.

981
00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:53.396
And that you can't be taught
that you learn it yourself.

982
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:55.640
by falling down and getting
hurt and getting back up.

983
00:46:56.054 --> 00:47:00.990
That was like way too long.

984
00:47:01.025 --> 00:47:03.441
Find someone that can say thesame thing better and use that!

985
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:23.841
The end of the '70s
skating died off and BMX

986
00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:25.601
was massive in Romford.

987
00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:28.224
BMX was immense.

988
00:47:28.259 --> 00:47:30.675
That's when E.T came
out. the film wasn't it?

989
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:32.539
It just... Boomed!

990
00:47:32.573 --> 00:47:34.852
Like a mushroom.. Unbelievable.

991
00:47:34.886 --> 00:47:37.855
This place was jam packed
with BMX riders. you know?

992
00:47:44.689 --> 00:47:48.727
BMX kind of came into the
scene around '79/ '80.

993
00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:50.108
what I got involved in.

994
00:47:50.971 --> 00:47:55.355
And I would say around 1980 was
when I first had the Grifter.

995
00:47:55.389 --> 00:48:00.084
ready to ride the Mongoose. but
went over there on the Grifter.

996
00:48:00.394 --> 00:48:02.638
Hello. I'm the new
Raleigh Grifter.

997
00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:06.780
I've got a new twist grip
for my three speed gear.

998
00:48:07.954 --> 00:48:09.748
brand new saddle design.

999
00:48:10.853 --> 00:48:12.510
and look at those chunky tyres!

1000
00:48:12.993 --> 00:48:17.480
And I noticed that the
skateboards. you see a few.

1001
00:48:17.515 --> 00:48:18.861
it's still a big scene.

1002
00:48:19.206 --> 00:48:22.692
But it looked overtaken
by with the bikes. It was

1003
00:48:22.727 --> 00:48:23.728
just BMX bikes everywhere.

1004
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:26.938
In the '80s this place
was dominated by BMX.

1005
00:48:26.973 --> 00:48:28.008
absolutely dominated.

1006
00:48:28.457 --> 00:48:30.804
You see photos from the '80s
and it's like hundreds of
kids sat

1007
00:48:30.838 --> 00:48:32.979
around all the bowls
and you know. definitely

1008
00:48:33.013 --> 00:48:33.841
the boom years for BMX.

1009
00:48:33.876 --> 00:48:35.326
The place was packed.

1010
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.433
There was probably 150 to 200people most weekends. you know.

1011
00:48:39.468 --> 00:48:42.091
I think what really
got me. it was just all

1012
00:48:42.126 --> 00:48:43.265
these amazing colours.

1013
00:48:43.299 --> 00:48:45.198
I can still see it like itwas yesterday. these reds and

1014
00:48:45.232 --> 00:48:48.408
yellows. Yellow tires! I hadnever seen a yellow tyre before.

1015
00:48:48.615 --> 00:48:51.307
That for me was. that was it.

1016
00:48:51.342 --> 00:48:54.793
I was hooked on the scene
and the sport and it

1017
00:48:54.828 --> 00:48:57.417
kinda just snowballed from
there for how I loved it.

1018
00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:59.522
They're like. well.
driving lessons or BMX?

1019
00:48:59.557 --> 00:49:01.386
That's a no brainer isn't?

1020
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:03.354
Didn't learn how to drivefor another 15 years after that.

1021
00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:05.045
I got a BMX for Christmas.

1022
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.635
It was a Raleigh. beautiful
black and gold Raleigh Ultra
Burner.

1023
00:49:09.256 --> 00:49:11.879
You know. without
realising at the time.

1024
00:49:11.914 --> 00:49:14.399
But was a sort
of a game changer

1025
00:49:14.434 --> 00:49:17.540
in the sense that it probably
dictated everything else that

1026
00:49:17.575 --> 00:49:18.679
I've done ever since. really.

1027
00:49:18.714 --> 00:49:21.406
You just wanted to look thebest. you wanted to be the

1028
00:49:21.441 --> 00:49:22.476
bollocks. you was 14 years old.

1029
00:49:22.718 --> 00:49:26.032
You was riding around with a
£300 bike between your legs

1030
00:49:26.066 --> 00:49:28.862
and dressed like Bjoörn Borgoff of center court. you know.

1031
00:49:28.896 --> 00:49:31.382
How the sport was moved on.
we weren't really that good.

1032
00:49:31.416 --> 00:49:33.004
I think we've just there
at the beginning. we were

1033
00:49:33.039 --> 00:49:35.248
just in a little bubble!

1034
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:39.631
Yeah. iI think with us lot.
we was more like stunt riders

1035
00:49:39.666 --> 00:49:41.185
really than anything else.

1036
00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:44.188
A Stupple! It's a bit of an
ego trip calling it a Stupple.

1037
00:49:44.222 --> 00:49:45.672
Yeah. I suspose it is really.

1038
00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:47.432
Not really any other
name you can call it.

1039
00:49:47.467 --> 00:49:51.402
Where do you practise
a stunt like that?

1040
00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:53.887
I mostly practise
at Romford Skatepark

1041
00:49:54.681 --> 00:49:57.166
I think now. the riders now.

1042
00:49:57.201 --> 00:49:59.617
have got a lot more finesse in
what they do.

1043
00:50:00.342 --> 00:50:03.276
Putting runs together and
that. What we used to do was

1044
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.863
just go a bit mental really.

1045
00:50:09.627 --> 00:50:14.183
It's a gentle skatepark like youcome here and it's just like all

1046
00:50:14.218 --> 00:50:18.498
'70s transitions. you know. It'sall rollovers and it's all...

1047
00:50:18.532 --> 00:50:21.121
I've come here to...
It's relaxing for me.

1048
00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:22.364
Romford's relaxing.

1049
00:50:22.398 --> 00:50:24.193
And even in the '80s and there
was hundreds of kids here.

1050
00:50:24.228 --> 00:50:27.196
You'd start at the top
and they'd be like. you'd

1051
00:50:27.231 --> 00:50:28.266
hear the chant of. you know:

1052
00:50:28.301 --> 00:50:30.061
"Going in!" "Following!"

1053
00:50:33.858 --> 00:50:34.928
"Following him!"

1054
00:50:34.962 --> 00:50:36.481
You know. and they'd be
like. kids dropping in

1055
00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:37.689
one after each other.

1056
00:50:37.724 --> 00:50:39.277
But there was never any.
you know. people wanting to

1057
00:50:39.312 --> 00:50:41.624
fight. And I've never seen
people wanting to fight each

1058
00:50:41.659 --> 00:50:43.074
other at Romford skatepark.

1059
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:45.076
I've never seen it. And
people get the 'ump. coz

1060
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:46.526
you might drop into them at
the wrong time.

1061
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.631
But no. I've never really seen
any sort of bad animosity

1062
00:50:48.666 --> 00:50:49.598
at this skatepark.

1063
00:50:50.288 --> 00:50:51.945
It's one of the better places
to come to ride. And that's

1064
00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:53.084
why I bring my kids here now.

1065
00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:55.086
So it's always been a
cool thing. you know.

1066
00:50:55.121 --> 00:50:56.846
You go to other places and
skaters are like

1067
00:50:56.881 --> 00:50:59.159
"This is our place.
skaters only!"

1068
00:50:59.401 --> 00:51:01.368
Rom was never like that.

1069
00:51:01.403 --> 00:51:03.853
You get the occasional
prick will turn up and

1070
00:51:03.888 --> 00:51:04.647
sort of start acting up.

1071
00:51:05.234 --> 00:51:07.754
I've literally thrown people outof here for. you know. bullying

1072
00:51:07.788 --> 00:51:08.651
kids and shouting and screaming.

1073
00:51:08.686 --> 00:51:10.239
So they get shown the door.

1074
00:51:10.274 --> 00:51:12.724
I think when it opened in '78.there might have been a little

1075
00:51:12.759 --> 00:51:13.725
bit of friction

1076
00:51:14.312 --> 00:51:16.866
because they didn't really like the BMX-ers. I don't think.

1077
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:17.936
to be honest.

1078
00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:19.731
I mean they wouldn't
admit it now. maybe but...

1079
00:51:22.389 --> 00:51:24.495
Yeah. that's me and mates.

1080
00:51:26.013 --> 00:51:27.601
I know exactly how that happened.

1081
00:51:28.292 --> 00:51:29.224
Yeah... Yeah.

1082
00:51:30.328 --> 00:51:32.296
There was this war with
the skateboarders.

1083
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.265
So we've got the BMX guys and
the skateboarders who were

1084
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.887
crashing into each other.

1085
00:51:37.922 --> 00:51:40.545
I remember it so clear. that
it's a couple of my friends

1086
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.823
and one of them had the
front to to do something.

1087
00:51:42.858 --> 00:51:45.240
cause I was only a small
boy at the time.

1088
00:51:45.723 --> 00:51:51.522
I think by memory. that theystarted arguing and I just see

1089
00:51:51.556 --> 00:51:55.767
my friend with helmet just gowhack straight across his head.

1090
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:58.632
And then it was just a
free for all and everyone

1091
00:51:58.667 --> 00:52:01.152
kicking and punching and...

1092
00:52:01.532 --> 00:52:05.777
You know. and it literally. assoon as it started. it finished.

1093
00:52:05.812 --> 00:52:07.952
it was waiting to happen.

1094
00:52:08.228 --> 00:52:12.301
My friend who threw
the first punch was the

1095
00:52:12.336 --> 00:52:13.544
guy who was going to do it.

1096
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:17.755
Oh I've got great memories
here. Getting a train up. and

1097
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:19.136
we all used to ride down here.

1098
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.689
Brilliant place.

1099
00:52:20.723 --> 00:52:22.311
We used to come over here
a lot with Andy Ruffell...

1100
00:52:22.346 --> 00:52:25.142
Andy Ruffell. me. Cav.
Andy. Nikky Matthews...

1101
00:52:25.176 --> 00:52:27.765
My other mate. Rich McLennan
who raced for Ace.

1102
00:52:28.317 --> 00:52:29.629
Summer holidays. we were
always over here.

1103
00:52:29.974 --> 00:52:31.631
If we weren't over here.
we'd be up the Southbank.

1104
00:52:32.804 --> 00:52:35.428
The actual story is. the story
of this Team Ace. how it
started...

1105
00:52:35.773 --> 00:52:36.774
I was the one who started it.

1106
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:38.085
54 in January.

1107
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:41.227
I still keep on
it now. I love it.

1108
00:52:42.607 --> 00:52:45.334
I hated it the first time I
came here. I didn't like it

1109
00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:46.680
at all. thought it was crap.

1110
00:52:47.129 --> 00:52:48.130
That would have been '81.

1111
00:52:49.062 --> 00:52:51.685
And then something happeneda whole year later

1112
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.550
I saw a little bit footage ofBob Haro.

1113
00:52:54.585 --> 00:52:57.450
I'd seen something and it
inspired me. and I was

1114
00:52:57.484 --> 00:52:59.003
like. I need to do that.

1115
00:52:59.314 --> 00:53:02.179
And then I was back over
and then I was over forever.

1116
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.561
When Bob Haro was here. I
had to grab him and get him

1117
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:06.942
behind the counter...

1118
00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.291
I've never wanted to do
that to anyone. you know.

1119
00:53:15.537 --> 00:53:18.022
Well I mean. Bob's a legend isn't he? I mean. he's you know.

1120
00:53:19.126 --> 00:53:21.301
I guess he's the
godfather of freestyle.

1121
00:53:23.269 --> 00:53:24.615
Back then. freestyle really

1122
00:53:24.649 --> 00:53:26.824
wasn't a sport yet. Itwas kind of this novelty.

1123
00:53:27.411 --> 00:53:29.585
And so

1124
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.380
when I was invited
over here and did shows

1125
00:53:31.415 --> 00:53:32.416
like at Earl's court or NEC.

1126
00:53:33.727 --> 00:53:37.006
You know. freestyle it
wasn't formalised yet.

1127
00:53:37.041 --> 00:53:39.008
It was just kind of this
halftime entertainment.

1128
00:53:39.043 --> 00:53:40.009
if you will.

1129
00:53:40.044 --> 00:53:43.323
In between motos and
events going on.

1130
00:53:43.358 --> 00:53:44.359
was my performance.

1131
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:47.258
And at that time everybody
was BMX racing.

1132
00:53:47.293 --> 00:53:49.812
There wasn't kids out here ridiglike today.

1133
00:53:49.847 --> 00:53:51.642
riding on ramps and stuff like .

1134
00:53:52.056 --> 00:53:53.471
So it was really novel.

1135
00:53:54.058 --> 00:53:56.854
So it was interesting to
come over here and see the

1136
00:53:56.888 --> 00:53:57.924
enthusiasm and all the kids.

1137
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.583
The first time. you know. seeingsomebody do this on a BMX bike.

1138
00:54:07.761 --> 00:54:10.971
For sure I know and
remember the Rom skatepark.

1139
00:54:11.903 --> 00:54:15.113
And when I went there
though. it was a standard

1140
00:54:15.148 --> 00:54:17.461
classic rainy English day.

1141
00:54:18.013 --> 00:54:19.117
So I didn't really
ride that day.

1142
00:54:19.773 --> 00:54:21.741
But I remember going
there and stuff like that.

1143
00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:24.433
And then throughout the years
and the decades I have always

1144
00:54:24.468 --> 00:54:25.986
remembered the Rom park.

1145
00:54:27.333 --> 00:54:30.646
But you know. I think placeslike Rom you'd see in all the

1146
00:54:30.681 --> 00:54:34.616
BMX magazines. BMX Action Bike.and RAD later on and so on.

1147
00:54:34.823 --> 00:54:37.515
But it was also that kind
of pilgrimage to kind of

1148
00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.276
just. you had to go to.

1149
00:54:39.897 --> 00:54:42.002
But when I actually wentthere. because there's this big

1150
00:54:42.037 --> 00:54:44.281
kind of pool and a big bowl.

1151
00:54:44.522 --> 00:54:45.696
it's quite intimidating.
you know.

1152
00:54:47.698 --> 00:54:51.978
BMX was sort of on it's big
wave of popularity in the UK.

1153
00:54:52.012 --> 00:54:53.324
I think every kid had a BMX.

1154
00:54:53.359 --> 00:54:57.466
And I kind of started doingall these tricks. which was new

1155
00:54:57.501 --> 00:54:59.434
to the BMX scene at the time.

1156
00:55:00.124 --> 00:55:02.160
And I guess I just practised
and practised and got

1157
00:55:02.195 --> 00:55:04.266
sponsored basically.

1158
00:55:05.509 --> 00:55:09.616
I was never that kid that
just hung around doing nothing

1159
00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:11.308
because I had BMX
and skateboarding. you know.

1160
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:13.482
And actually those. both
of those took me all around

1161
00:55:13.517 --> 00:55:17.003
the world and probably
really were the foundations

1162
00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:18.245
for what I still do now.

1163
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:22.595
Gumball was created really
as a combination of all my

1164
00:55:22.629 --> 00:55:23.803
influences really on life.

1165
00:55:23.837 --> 00:55:27.116
Across kind of the whole actionsports world. art world.

1166
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:29.256
and cars and music. which is

1167
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:30.188
quite diverse. but it's

1168
00:55:30.223 --> 00:55:32.121
kind of what'smade me tick over the years.

1169
00:55:32.156 --> 00:55:34.503
Back when I started it.
it was actually just a

1170
00:55:34.538 --> 00:55:35.539
continuation of skateboarding.

1171
00:55:35.884 --> 00:55:40.854
I used to skate in one spot.
we'd skate until we'd had

1172
00:55:40.889 --> 00:55:43.581
enough of it or we got kicked
off and then we'd go somewhere

1173
00:55:43.616 --> 00:55:46.239
else and we do it again and
do it again and do it again.

1174
00:55:46.273 --> 00:55:50.243
And the rally was the same. We'ddrive to one city. we'd party.

1175
00:55:50.277 --> 00:55:52.556
we'd cause a disturbance. andthen we'd drive on the next day.

1176
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.867
And we do it somewhere else.

1177
00:55:53.902 --> 00:55:57.250
When I look back on it. I'dbeen doing that from the age of

1178
00:55:57.284 --> 00:55:59.114
11 and I'm still doing it now.

1179
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.979
But just now there's more
people coming out to see it.

1180
00:56:02.013 --> 00:56:03.877
But it's exactly the same.

1181
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:09.607
There's this BMX competition
in London. which was a really

1182
00:56:09.642 --> 00:56:12.783
big deal at the time called
the Hole Shot was organised

1183
00:56:13.128 --> 00:56:14.129
by a guy called Andy Ruffell.

1184
00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:16.752
It was a big kind of freestyle
competition

1185
00:56:16.787 --> 00:56:19.306
and that was game
changing because American

1186
00:56:19.341 --> 00:56:20.411
pros came over for it.

1187
00:56:20.446 --> 00:56:23.380
I mean. I saw an American
pro rider get off his

1188
00:56:23.414 --> 00:56:25.830
bike and kinda did about
five minutes of rapping.

1189
00:56:26.279 --> 00:56:29.662
And I think I'd never
seen rap music before.

1190
00:56:30.697 --> 00:56:33.459
I saw skateboarding in a light
that I'd never seen before

1191
00:56:33.493 --> 00:56:37.601
and just watching Gonz. likejust freely kind of glide

1192
00:56:37.635 --> 00:56:41.605
centre in and out of us BMXers.
around this giant sports

1193
00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.435
over benches and bikes.
And him just sort of ollying

1194
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.681
And it was incredible. I
mean it was incredible.

1195
00:56:48.715 --> 00:56:52.857
And I guess that was the
most inspiring thing for me

1196
00:56:52.892 --> 00:56:54.203
to get into skateboarding.

1197
00:56:54.238 --> 00:56:57.793
Just seeing this guy just
sort of do stuff that I

1198
00:56:57.828 --> 00:56:58.829
didn't think you could do.

1199
00:57:01.176 --> 00:57:04.938
Andy was more of a racer.
Although I've been here

1200
00:57:04.973 --> 00:57:08.045
when he rode here. it was
more like he was a racer.

1201
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:11.324
He was one of the real
elites to be honest. he was

1202
00:57:11.358 --> 00:57:12.152
pretty much untouchable.

1203
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:17.088
It was Andy. Craig Schofield.
Sid Salisbury. Jason Maloney

1204
00:57:17.123 --> 00:57:19.297
and they were all like a
little bit of a clique.

1205
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:20.851
They stick together.

1206
00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:23.336
Yeah. it was hard
to get in with them.

1207
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.477
I suppose it could have been
a bit a little bit cliquey
then. but you know....

1208
00:57:26.512 --> 00:57:27.720
I wasn't in the clique!

1209
00:57:27.754 --> 00:57:28.893
I was with Billy
on the outskirts.

1210
00:57:29.273 --> 00:57:32.725
Well in bicycle motocross. Iaim to be very good at freestlye

1211
00:57:32.759 --> 00:57:34.036
and very good at racing as well.

1212
00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:34.899
Over the whoops!

1213
00:57:37.177 --> 00:57:39.179
And It's Andy Ruffell
1st for team white.

1214
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.149
And top stunt rider
Andy Ruffell. at just 18

1215
00:57:43.183 --> 00:57:45.565
he's one of the biggest
names in the sport.

1216
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:50.397
I've actually managed to find
somebody here

1217
00:57:50.432 --> 00:57:53.055
who we haven't all seen
for a very long time.

1218
00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:55.368
Can I introduce you once
again to Andy Ruffell?

1219
00:57:55.402 --> 00:57:56.093
Hi Andy!

1220
00:57:56.956 --> 00:57:57.681
...Hi

1221
00:57:58.544 --> 00:58:00.097
That was very cool. wasn't it?

1222
00:58:00.615 --> 00:58:01.995
I was a skater. I must've been .

1223
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.170
10 years old or 11 years old.

1224
00:58:04.757 --> 00:58:07.863
I actually had my skateboard
stolen at Skate City

1225
00:58:07.898 --> 00:58:10.728
and that's when I got
into getting a BMX bike.

1226
00:58:11.004 --> 00:58:13.800
And then when this place opened.it was great for me because I

1227
00:58:13.835 --> 00:58:14.905
didn't have to go to Skate City.

1228
00:58:14.939 --> 00:58:17.908
I could come up here
and ride a BMX bike.

1229
00:58:19.219 --> 00:58:21.187
The reason Rom was special
for me is. I did a lot

1230
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:22.740
of things first here.

1231
00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:26.951
I did my first 360.

1232
00:58:27.538 --> 00:58:31.162
I remember some of the worstcrashes I ever had were at Rom.

1233
00:58:32.094 --> 00:58:35.304
The performance bowl. my chainbroke and you know. I fell from

1234
00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:38.687
the top to literally the bottomconcrete and landed on my knees.

1235
00:58:38.722 --> 00:58:40.758
And I still feel that today.

1236
00:58:41.138 --> 00:58:42.898
Because that's what's
important about Rom because

1237
00:58:42.933 --> 00:58:44.037
I think a lot of people.

1238
00:58:44.072 --> 00:58:47.144
me. Craig Schofield. Craig
Campbell. my brother of

1239
00:58:47.178 --> 00:58:48.697
course. Neil Ruffell.

1240
00:58:48.732 --> 00:58:51.355
You know. this was a reallearning ground. I think.

1241
00:58:51.389 --> 00:58:54.013
You know. all those guys and a lot of others really learnt

1242
00:58:54.047 --> 00:58:55.739
their skills right here in this

1243
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.050
and especially me.

1244
00:58:57.395 --> 00:58:59.570
So I remember spending
literally four hours over

1245
00:58:59.605 --> 00:59:01.814
there in that little part
over there. just basically

1246
00:59:01.848 --> 00:59:04.230
trying to pull off front hops.

1247
00:59:04.575 --> 00:59:07.923
And I remember when I pulled
off some front hops in 1978

1248
00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:10.788
the crowd went wild coz
I did some front hops.

1249
00:59:10.823 --> 00:59:13.653
So it was like. you know.
it's kind of wild but it was

1250
00:59:13.688 --> 00:59:15.068
a really good education
for riding a bike.

1251
00:59:17.174 --> 00:59:20.902
Yeah. I think my brother alwayssurprised everybody cause he...

1252
00:59:21.592 --> 00:59:24.284
I mean be honest. I never
saw anyone ride a bike -

1253
00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:26.217
I know this sounds silly
because he's me brother.

1254
00:59:26.252 --> 00:59:28.841
But I never saw anyone
ride a bike like he did.

1255
00:59:29.255 --> 00:59:31.844
You know. and in terms of
getting air. you know. I

1256
00:59:31.878 --> 00:59:32.845
mean I've seen him up here.

1257
00:59:33.052 --> 00:59:35.468
Luckily I was. you
know. retiring.

1258
00:59:36.642 --> 00:59:39.645
Thank God ! Coz Neil
just was just ripping.

1259
00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:43.027
I mean. I've seen him get
10ft out of the performance.
you know. many times.

1260
00:59:43.062 --> 00:59:44.822
So that was cool. I think a
lot of people were surprised.

1261
00:59:44.857 --> 00:59:46.859
They just thought. oh yes.
that's Andy's brother.

1262
00:59:46.893 --> 00:59:49.068
That's why he's got a big name
because he's Andy's Brother.

1263
00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.312
He's ten times a betterbike rider than I ever was.

1264
00:59:52.347 --> 00:59:54.591
So I was like. you
know. he deserved it.

1265
00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:57.628
And so. I'm just glad I
retired when he was. you

1266
00:59:57.663 --> 00:59:58.629
know. coming into his peak.

1267
01:00:00.424 --> 01:00:02.391
It's a very special place.

1268
01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:04.428
Very special people that.
you know. still skate

1269
01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:05.429
here after 40 years.

1270
01:00:05.912 --> 01:00:07.224
And it certainly helped
my career big time.

1271
01:00:08.674 --> 01:00:10.365
You know. I basically
learned to ride a bike here.

1272
01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:14.093
That was a really tough pool
and it still is actually.

1273
01:00:14.714 --> 01:00:16.233
Don't believe what theytell you...

1274
01:00:16.474 --> 01:00:18.649
That you do forget how to
ride a bike.

1275
01:00:18.684 --> 01:00:19.650
Let me tell you.

1276
01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:24.034
I'm amazed that Rom is still here.

1277
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.416
I mean it's crazy. I mean
I'm sitting here now and

1278
01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:29.556
I've got so many memories.
personal memories here.

1279
01:00:29.867 --> 01:00:32.836
But the fact that it's here like40 years later. is just crazy.

1280
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.638
It was like roaring. a good150ft up in the air. the flames.

1281
01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:45.089
Still can't quite believe
it's gone. to be honest.

1282
01:00:48.955 --> 01:00:49.680
Nightmare.

1283
01:00:51.371 --> 01:00:54.478
This ramp was built in '99.

1284
01:00:56.135 --> 01:00:59.586
And we just got some
Heritage Lottery Funding.

1285
01:01:00.346 --> 01:01:03.867
Sods law is as we got that
funding to help us clear the

1286
01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:06.214
space and promote the park.
Now this fire has happened.

1287
01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:12.496
Cause we just finished
removing the old mini-ramp
from up the top there.

1288
01:01:13.117 --> 01:01:14.671
That had been there
for 30 odd years.

1289
01:01:15.085 --> 01:01:16.362
So we were just getting ahead.

1290
01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:17.674
We're just stepping
forward. getting to clear

1291
01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.709
that space. ready to go.

1292
01:01:18.744 --> 01:01:20.297
And It's just... It's hard.

1293
01:01:25.164 --> 01:01:28.063
This was our only indoor
bit when It's raining. and

1294
01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:29.686
they got nowhere to go.

1295
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.309
Bit of a kick right
in the teeth. really.

1296
01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:39.350
Everything's easy
now. It's there.

1297
01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:41.698
Walk down to your local park.
there's a skatepark there.

1298
01:01:41.905 --> 01:01:45.287
You've got so many free
skate parks that pop up.

1299
01:01:45.322 --> 01:01:46.357
that councils put on.

1300
01:01:46.599 --> 01:01:49.947
So It's hard to get people.
I suppose. To come and ride

1301
01:01:49.982 --> 01:01:51.362
somewhere where they've got
to pay. when they've got

1302
01:01:51.397 --> 01:01:52.778
somewhere free to go to.

1303
01:01:52.812 --> 01:01:55.988
And it needs kids to get
here. You know. it's kind of

1304
01:01:56.022 --> 01:01:57.023
getting forgotten about a bit.

1305
01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:01.441
Rom had a more of a captiveaudience because there just

1306
01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:02.960
weren't as many places to skate.

1307
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.722
Whereas now there's parks
popping up all over the place.

1308
01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:09.346
It's difficult for somewhere
like Rom to survive.

1309
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:17.147
But looking into the future youthink. is there a future for any

1310
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:19.943
commercial. outdoor skate park?

1311
01:02:19.977 --> 01:02:22.773
Everything else that's
commercial is indoor because

1312
01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:25.742
you've got to maximise
your income all year round.

1313
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:29.021
There's so many free
parks around the country

1314
01:02:29.055 --> 01:02:30.436
spreading it so thin.

1315
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.957
I think we're probably one
of. if not the only privately

1316
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.406
run skate park in England.

1317
01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.961
People come here
and they love it.

1318
01:02:37.995 --> 01:02:41.343
Riding around this park
on anything wheeled is

1319
01:02:41.378 --> 01:02:43.656
a great... It's fun.

1320
01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.797
If we don't get some help here.we'd might be in trouble and

1321
01:02:46.832 --> 01:02:49.869
the place could go in completedisrepair. to be quite honest.

1322
01:02:52.976 --> 01:02:56.980
It must be protected. It must
be saved. It is of absolute

1323
01:02:57.014 --> 01:02:59.051
vital national importance.

1324
01:02:59.085 --> 01:03:01.812
And to give hope to
those kids that otherwise

1325
01:03:01.847 --> 01:03:03.020
without it don't have hope.

1326
01:03:03.055 --> 01:03:05.022
They don't have a place.
they can't express themselves

1327
01:03:05.057 --> 01:03:06.403
and they go the wrong way.

1328
01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:10.234
The way things are
going. you know.

1329
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.995
Rent goes up. rates go up.

1330
01:03:12.858 --> 01:03:14.031
Insurance goes up.

1331
01:03:14.066 --> 01:03:16.620
It's the overheads
that are quite large.

1332
01:03:19.002 --> 01:03:20.520
It's getting worse and worse.

1333
01:03:22.005 --> 01:03:25.111
The takings are going down.
The expenses are going up.

1334
01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:36.674
Like when we used to have
crowds of kids queuing up.

1335
01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:37.710
No one was here last Saturday.

1336
01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:38.504
No one.

1337
01:03:38.538 --> 01:03:39.539
Not one.

1338
01:03:54.554 --> 01:03:58.731
We are building a wall
for an artwork project

1339
01:03:58.765 --> 01:04:01.492
by the London police.
Amsterdam based art group.

1340
01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:05.496
To promote the skate
park and get some more

1341
01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.497
people in here. hopefully.

1342
01:04:07.567 --> 01:04:10.674
The London Police are a
group of street artists.

1343
01:04:10.985 --> 01:04:15.541
Two of them mainly based inAmsterdam. from Essex. and they

1344
01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:16.680
do murals around the world.

1345
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.278
You know. It's going tobe cool. Whatever they do.

1346
01:04:28.312 --> 01:04:29.624
they've never done a bad piece.

1347
01:04:39.358 --> 01:04:41.291
Who are we? We're
The London place.

1348
01:04:41.325 --> 01:04:43.051
The Essex Police are called
the Essex Police where the

1349
01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:44.259
London Police are calledthe Metropolitan Police.

1350
01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:45.882
So that was up for grabs.

1351
01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.091
you know. that was out
there. So we had that.

1352
01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:51.473
You've always said too. everyoneknows the word London and

1353
01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:53.993
the word police and you putthem together and it's kind

1354
01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:56.271
of instantly recognisableall around the world.

1355
01:04:56.306 --> 01:04:59.896
I mean they know the word 'The'as well. I mean. there's three

1356
01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.346
words right now that everyonein the world can understand.

1357
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.005
And it does stand out when you
see it on the lineup of stuff.

1358
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.215
You do look at it. It'sa stand out. It's a funname.

1359
01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:11.079
We still like it.
It's stupid. Let's face it.

1360
01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:14.289
But I think you said as well
that the idea of policing

1361
01:05:14.324 --> 01:05:16.153
the streets with good art.

1362
01:05:16.188 --> 01:05:19.087
Making... Looking
after the streets.

1363
01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:21.710
That obviously came after wegot the name. It's not like.

1364
01:05:21.745 --> 01:05:22.746
you know. we've got that first.

1365
01:05:23.367 --> 01:05:26.336
But our connection with Rom.we were both. we when were

1366
01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:27.613
younger. rubbish skateboarders.

1367
01:05:27.647 --> 01:05:29.097
but very enthusiastic.

1368
01:05:29.132 --> 01:05:30.788
Yeah. I thought you were a
bit more rubbish than I was.

1369
01:05:30.823 --> 01:05:33.757
We always came to Rom. I
came here countless times.

1370
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:35.724
I know you did and I didn't
know you at the time.

1371
01:05:35.759 --> 01:05:38.348
But I knew you being a
couple of years older...

1372
01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:40.833
Yeah I was trying to avoid youwhen you were in the performancebowl.

1373
01:05:40.867 --> 01:05:42.939
I was well over there likewith the other ramps and stuff.

1374
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.735
Finally we actually met
at some point. had to be
friends

1375
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:47.978
and I realised
you're quite a good guy.

1376
01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:51.154
You feel like. you're doing
something for a place that

1377
01:05:51.188 --> 01:05:56.297
really gave something to
you in your early years.

1378
01:05:56.849 --> 01:06:01.129
It's giving back. It's
being part of a inspiring

1379
01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:05.030
journey to try and get this
place full of life again.

1380
01:06:05.823 --> 01:06:09.758
As we all understand these
days. council's provide nice
ramp

1381
01:06:09.793 --> 01:06:12.313
and skate park facilities
for free and in local parks.

1382
01:06:12.692 --> 01:06:14.694
And over the last 10/20
years that's really...

1383
01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:17.628
They've come in abundance
really for young skaters.

1384
01:06:17.663 --> 01:06:21.356
So to pay to come into
a park. you know. it's

1385
01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:23.427
made it harder for this
place to attract people.

1386
01:06:24.118 --> 01:06:27.914
But just the facilities here
and the heritage of it. is

1387
01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:29.916
something really special.

1388
01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:32.574
So by coming and injecting
some life into it.

1389
01:06:32.609 --> 01:06:34.024
through doing artwork.

1390
01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:37.890
Hopefully that will be thefirst step to now revampingthis place.

1391
01:06:37.924 --> 01:06:40.237
rejuvenating thatsame vibe that we felt as kids.

1392
01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:45.380
And hopefully with good people
involved. it's going to turn

1393
01:06:45.415 --> 01:06:46.416
into something special here.

1394
01:06:47.244 --> 01:06:50.178
Yeah. I think. if you had toldus 20/30 years ago that

1395
01:06:50.213 --> 01:06:53.802
we'd get the chance to be here and to do this... I mean fantastic.

1396
01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:57.013
By a little bit of artwork.
it can really affect change.

1397
01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.842
albeit a little small mural.

1398
01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:02.397
But I think it feeds off
the energy and creates

1399
01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:04.054
kind of a momentum.

1400
01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:06.298
I can imagine this
place being full of art.

1401
01:07:08.438 --> 01:07:11.234
But we've been doing this for
20 years as well. so we have

1402
01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:14.202
a certain way we do things and
we just employed that same

1403
01:07:14.237 --> 01:07:15.238
method in this project too.

1404
01:07:15.652 --> 01:07:19.518
Turn up. get the basics
in and then work out how

1405
01:07:19.552 --> 01:07:21.554
it's going to go and let
it breathe. let it flow.

1406
01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:24.523
And we're hoping that everyone'sgoing to appreciate the piece

1407
01:07:24.557 --> 01:07:28.078
we've done. which does haveskateboard influence in it.

1408
01:07:28.285 --> 01:07:30.287
It does have influence
of the actual place here.

1409
01:07:30.805 --> 01:07:33.256
It's made especially so thatfrom the other side of the

1410
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.706
skate park. you can still sensea little bit what's going on.

1411
01:07:35.913 --> 01:07:39.538
As opposed to having to be
next to it like you would in
an art gallery or something.

1412
01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:43.887
That's quite a big part
of it. that this is such
a nice vast open park.

1413
01:07:43.921 --> 01:07:46.269
So it needed to be over there.

1414
01:07:46.303 --> 01:07:48.443
'Oh. I can see what it is. but
let me go over there and then

1415
01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.342
check out the finer details'.

1416
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:54.311
Yeah. it's the basic nature
of how things work in life.

1417
01:07:54.346 --> 01:07:57.487
You know. you sow a seed
and plant grows. and from

1418
01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:00.145
the plant comes flowers.
and from the flowers comes

1419
01:08:00.179 --> 01:08:01.456
the joy of seeing it and...

1420
01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:02.975
Blah. blah. blah.

1421
01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:06.254
So hopefully this is a
seed and hopefully they'll

1422
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:07.945
be flowers at some point
for people to enjoy.

1423
01:08:13.296 --> 01:08:15.712
Ladies and gentlemen. it gives
me great pleasure to open the

1424
01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:20.406
Rom skatepark 40 exhibition.

1425
01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:24.445
and I formally declare
the exhibition open!

1426
01:09:25.299 --> 01:09:32.168
Rom today. is the biggest.
largest. best. skate park in

1427
01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:35.378
the world to have any kind
of historic preservation.

1428
01:09:35.585 --> 01:09:39.244
Great. I just never realised
that you could even do
that with a skate park.

1429
01:09:40.037 --> 01:09:44.180
And indeed you could well
claim for Rom. it's the only

1430
01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:47.321
proper skate park in the world
to be historically listed.

1431
01:09:47.528 --> 01:09:50.979
Something with a big range
of facilities with a pool

1432
01:09:51.014 --> 01:09:53.913
and a bowl and a Cloverleaf.
and a half pipe and so on.

1433
01:09:55.605 --> 01:09:58.780
The beauty of skateboarding
is that it's art.

1434
01:09:58.815 --> 01:09:59.816
It keeps moving forward.

1435
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:01.783
You don't have the NBA.

1436
01:10:01.818 --> 01:10:03.129
where a basketball player

1437
01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:04.855
can walk in before a game.

1438
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:05.925
and tear the hoops down and

1439
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.926
put three hoops at three

1440
01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:07.962
feet high and say.

1441
01:10:08.342 --> 01:10:10.033
this is what the game is today.

1442
01:10:10.067 --> 01:10:11.414
And that's what skateboarding
does

1443
01:10:11.448 --> 01:10:12.725
all the time.

1444
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.799
It is also the prototype for
every single skate park

1445
01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:18.835
in Britain today.

1446
01:10:20.077 --> 01:10:22.804
And something that these
guys that rode 40 years

1447
01:10:22.839 --> 01:10:25.738
ago is keeping them
riding means it's right.

1448
01:10:25.945 --> 01:10:30.398
This is old school. This
is what it used to be like.

1449
01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:32.158
Now it's not.

1450
01:10:32.504 --> 01:10:36.542
It just feels like part of
the old skating. I'd say

1451
01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:37.578
it's about the closest thing.

1452
01:10:37.957 --> 01:10:39.062
Point is there's weather.

1453
01:10:39.096 --> 01:10:40.028
Point is when it's pissing down

1454
01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:40.960
we have a skid contest.

1455
01:10:40.995 --> 01:10:42.824
It's England. man.

1456
01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:43.860
It ain't California.

1457
01:10:44.067 --> 01:10:48.451
So it's an incredibly valuable
piece of architecture.

1458
01:10:48.865 --> 01:10:51.177
Both as a bit of skateboard architecture from the '70s

1459
01:10:51.212 --> 01:10:54.284
and for it's influence into
the future.

1460
01:10:54.871 --> 01:10:57.770
It is what it is for a reason.
You know it's history.

1461
01:10:57.805 --> 01:10:59.427
Don't. just stop that man.

1462
01:10:59.462 --> 01:11:01.740
That's the point. It looks
old. It's England.

1463
01:11:01.774 --> 01:11:02.775
shit's old.

1464
01:11:03.086 --> 01:11:06.054
And I really hope this place
stays. cause I hear rumours

1465
01:11:06.089 --> 01:11:08.919
that it's in trouble at the
moment and this is one of

1466
01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:11.819
the most iconic skate parks
there is on the planet.

1467
01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:15.340
It's almost. kind of our
duty to kinda keep them alive

1468
01:11:15.374 --> 01:11:17.342
really and certainly because
it's more than skateboarding.

1469
01:11:17.376 --> 01:11:18.688
It's more than BMXing.

1470
01:11:18.722 --> 01:11:21.587
It's actually developed...
It's shaped my whole life.

1471
01:11:21.622 --> 01:11:23.762
It shapes what my family do.
it shapes what my friends do.

1472
01:11:23.796 --> 01:11:26.282
and that's across all industriesand everything you know.

1473
01:11:38.777 --> 01:11:44.955
Rom should be updated. kept.added to. but the direction we've gone is...

1474
01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:48.373
Why don't we we tear that down or redesign it for the Olympic course?

1475
01:11:48.407 --> 01:11:50.789
What's the Olympic course?
What's the Olympic course?

1476
01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:52.377
Nonsense.

1477
01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:54.482
The Olympic course is going
to be obsolete before the

1478
01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:55.380
Olympics get there

1479
01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:56.415
because skateboarding is art.

1480
01:11:58.969 --> 01:12:02.594
I don't know of any other
skate park in the world

1481
01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:06.391
that is as complete and as
varied.

1482
01:12:06.425 --> 01:12:11.154
and substantial as Rom and stillenjoys this historic listing.

1483
01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:14.951
The local authority. government.havering. whoever it is needs

1484
01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:18.334
to realise what they have andthe architectural and cultural

1485
01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:19.369
importance of this place.

1486
01:12:19.404 --> 01:12:21.578
There is no other. you
will never get another

1487
01:12:21.613 --> 01:12:23.408
if it goes. it's gone.

1488
01:12:56.441 --> 01:12:58.753
Well. there's a group of
us that have got together

1489
01:12:58.788 --> 01:13:00.548
and we're putting in
everything we can afford.

1490
01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.654
Different people from
different walks of life.

1491
01:13:02.688 --> 01:13:07.659
We've got lawyers and ex bank
managers. to lorry drivers
to plumbers. to mechanics.

1492
01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.421
That are all chipping in to
basically pay the basic needs

1493
01:13:11.456 --> 01:13:13.596
so that the park doesn't
fall into the wrong hands.

1494
01:13:18.152 --> 01:13:19.395
We've been here 40 years.

1495
01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:43.591
Yeah. people say to me. you
know. you're in your fifties.

1496
01:13:43.626 --> 01:13:48.251
you skateboard.
You're some kind of freak.

1497
01:13:48.285 --> 01:13:50.529
And you know. they look at you
very. very. very strangely.

1498
01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:55.085
Like where does that
come from and why? And...

1499
01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:03.473
And I think it's just
because skateboarding for

1500
01:14:03.508 --> 01:14:05.682
whatever reason. has been
associated with kids.

1501
01:14:05.717 --> 01:14:09.652
People still just think
of it as a kid's activity.

1502
01:14:11.654 --> 01:14:13.656
I had eggs for breakfast.

1503
01:14:14.864 --> 01:14:16.555
Actually. i had eggs
on toast for breakfast.

1504
01:14:18.143 --> 01:14:19.593
Shit. now I'm all thirsty.

1505
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:22.734
The question that you asked
me like two and a half hours

1506
01:14:22.768 --> 01:14:24.874
ago was what year was this?

1507
01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.496
It was '78 - '80!

1508
01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:31.156
Sorry!

1509
01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:34.400
What was the question?

1510
01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:40.061
I really like rolling thunder
and they had a party out

1511
01:14:40.096 --> 01:14:41.511
there that I really remember.

1512
01:14:42.408 --> 01:14:46.965
Roger Daltrey was partying up
in the high room and that was

1513
01:14:46.999 --> 01:14:49.623
just such a rocking session.

1514
01:14:50.555 --> 01:14:52.315
I mean how much can I tell?

1515
01:14:54.317 --> 01:14:58.286
You know. I created the
world freestyle... Awards

1516
01:14:58.321 --> 01:15:00.910
freestyle... Say that again!

1517
01:15:02.912 --> 01:15:05.501
I got told by pretty
much everybody.

1518
01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:06.847
get a proper job !

1519
01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:10.126
I didn't work for 20 years
for as I'm concerned.

1520
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.404
I was a professional BMX rider.uknow. who had the last laugh?

1521
01:15:16.995 --> 01:15:18.203
Nice tits.

1522
01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:19.860
I'll tell you what.
I'm filling out.

1523
01:15:21.931 --> 01:15:25.521
Occasionally I go to
Meanwhile gardens.

1524
01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:27.557
and do my stuff late at night.

1525
01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:32.389
And sometimes fall off and
think. you know. if someone
could see me now! You Know?

1526
01:15:32.976 --> 01:15:35.841
What am I doing? But I
love it. So it's great.

1527
01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:40.984
Everyone's going to
think 'Who's that twat?'.

1528
01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:44.712
I don't know. But I think
that... To be honest. they'll

1529
01:15:44.747 --> 01:15:46.783
think that anyway. regardless
of with the glasses on or off.

1530
01:15:48.509 --> 01:15:51.132
A little hedgehog came
out of the bushes and

1531
01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:53.825
it looked up at me.

1532
01:15:53.859 --> 01:16:01.073
It shared my emotional state.
you know. and understood that
I was having a rough day.

1533
01:16:03.455 --> 01:16:05.630
It seems like I was going
down this hill forever.

1534
01:16:06.078 --> 01:16:08.702
Forever and ever - A bit
like I go on anyway! But...

1535
01:16:11.877 --> 01:16:14.846
Oh. I'm just sitting here
looking at myself by myself.

1536
01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:25.581
This is not what I do. Oh. therewas me when I was little....

1537
01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:29.412
Oh it's me when I
was little again.

1538
01:16:30.102 --> 01:16:33.174
Oh it's was just about me.
Oh. I love looking at me.

1539
01:16:35.107 --> 01:16:36.695
Something like that!

1540
01:16:37.938 --> 01:16:40.078
Oh. I'm not that dude.

1541
01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:44.185
He just can't talk. He's a drip

1542
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.187
It's why I keep trying to
talk over him because he's

1543
01:16:46.222 --> 01:16:48.189
too quiet. You probably won't
even hear him in the film.

1544
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.700
I've still got to
work on it obviously.

1545
01:17:15.734 --> 01:17:16.632
That middle bit...

1546
01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.944
My name is Andrew Markou

1547
01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:21.775
My mates called me Popadopoulos.

1548
01:17:22.879 --> 01:17:27.573
I've been skating since
2003 and this was the
first place I came to.

1549
01:17:29.265 --> 01:17:33.062
That was '79 and came
back to Rom in '97 when
I started skating again.

1550
01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.581
and I've been coming ever since.more or less.

1551
01:17:36.582 --> 01:17:37.756
One thing. I will say...

1552
01:17:46.938 --> 01:17:50.148
Get here before it was
open. bashing around in
the car park out there.

1553
01:17:50.182 --> 01:17:53.738
Knocking on the door.
waiting for John to
come out and let us in.

1554
01:17:53.772 --> 01:17:56.775
We used in climb over here afterthe builders had gone home.

1555
01:17:57.707 --> 01:18:00.917
Lay sheets of ply out
to get through the sea
of mud and just skate.

1556
01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:44.789
...Zinger!
