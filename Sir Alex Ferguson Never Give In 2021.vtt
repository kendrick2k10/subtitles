[man]
My dad wasn't feeling well.
He's collapsed.

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
He can't really get up.

39
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.920
So the doctor said to--

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.880
to phone an ambulance
straight away.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.920

He said. well the next time.

Bite him bloody back.

[Jason] We're in this side
room.

86
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.400

"Look. Mr Ferguson.
I'm afraid to say.

you've had a bleed on the brain.

90
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.160
And all of a sudden. he just--

91
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.840
He just put his head
in his hands and went. "Ugh!

92
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.400
I hope there's nothing
wrong with my memory.

And I was like. "Right?"

95
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600
And then he just started
telling these random stories.

96
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.560
Where the only connection
between any of them

97
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.080
was the fact that they all
happened a long time ago.

98
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560
I think he's telling me
these stories

99
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.480

that he's still...

what happens. right.

That history.

119
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.880
It gets ingrained into you.

120
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400
Think about it.

121
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.400
Me as a manager.

122
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.960
I used to lie in bed
thinking about themes

123
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.560
where I could
address the players that
would make an impact on them.

124
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.600
You know...
I would talk about miners.

125
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.120
shipyard workers.
welders. toolmakers.

126
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.560
You know. people who've
come from poor backgrounds.

127
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.000
And I used to ask them.

128
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.520
what did your grandfather do?

129
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.640
What did your father do?

130
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.760
But I have to get
the-the feeling inside them

131
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.960
that what their grandfathers
worked for.

132
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.840
and their grandmothers.
is part of them.

133
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.000
And they have to--
they have to display
that meaning.

134
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.840
And... taking away
all the-the trophies I've won

135
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.040
and the great players I've had.

136
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.160
I think it's a thing
about life.

137
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.080
It's a fact of life
that where we come from
is important.

138
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.760
You come out with an identity.

139
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.120
I come from Govan.

140
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.480
I'm a Govan boy.

141
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.280
I loved it because it was
buzzing. you know.

142
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.920
People selling fruit
in barrows.

143
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.840
All sorts of things
were going on.

144
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.400
The place was alive.

145
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.760
But. um. there was
another side to it.

146
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.680
From time to time
you would come up

147
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.680
against. uh.
guys from different areas.

148
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640
These were really tough areas.

149
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.320
And sometimes
I had to defend my brother.

150
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.560
Martin.

151
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.880
[Martin]
Alec was always a leader.

152
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.680
Always wanted to be
the guy in front. you know.

153
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.280
Alec was always first to be in.

154
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.120
[Alex] There was a boy
bullying Martin.

155
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.880
So I went up
to the boy's house.

156
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.200
His father came to the door
and says.
"What do you want son?"

157
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.200
I said.
"I want to see your son.
He's been bullying my brother."

158
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.120
He says.
"That's not my business."
And he closed the door.

159
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.160
So I got him
on the playground...

160
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.160
He was...
wee sturdy wee guy. you know?

161
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.680
And anyway.
he never bullied Martin again.

162
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.360
Everyone has
their own personality.

163
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.520
Some walk away from things.

164
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.560
Some say. "No. I'm not
going to accept this."

165
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.320
When you're growing up
in a place like Govan.

166
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.360
most people are fighting
to get out of there.

167
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.600
It's the capitalist attitude
to the working class.

168
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640
Keep them down there.

169
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.400
Absolutely no doubt about that.

170
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.200
And I was lucky because...

171
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.400
the football was the savior.

172
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.800
Through that.
I got all the breaks.

173
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
I progressed.

174
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.480
My Dad.
he played a part in that.

175
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.160
He followed us everywhere.

176
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.760
[Martin]

starting to approach my Dad.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.160
But the one I was hoping that
would go for me was Rangers.

180
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.680
I was a big Rangers fan.
Lived right behind the stadium.

181
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.680
But anyway. my dad
wouldn't let me go full-time.

182
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.800
Apprenticeship first.
and then you can go full-time.

He was trying to protect me
in case I didn't make it
as a footballer.

184
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.240
But I don't think
it did me any harm.

185
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.360
serving my apprenticeship
as a toolmaker.

186
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.320

in understanding people.

She was a strong socialist.

And. uh... I was a shop
steward for the apprentices.

196
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.360

that was a really important
moment for me.

It was great.
being a part of it.

198
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.560
It wasn't about you.
it was about us.

199
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.720
It was about being a team.

And then.
I was getting despondent
about the football side of it.

213
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.560
because I wasn't a first team

The brain controls everything.

in your brain. in your memories.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.160
I just stopped.
I was in no-- no-man's-land.

311
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.680
So I remember
estimating his mortality

312
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.160
at that point in time
as 80 percent.

313
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.680
As in. there was an 80 percent
chance he would not survive.

314
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.040
And then.
the doctor came and said.

315
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.360
"Look. we're about to
take him down

316
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.440
for the operation."

317
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.720
Two people can go in
and see him

318
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.000
before he gets operated on.

319
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.040
So I said. look.
I'll take my mom in.

320
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.160
And it was a shock.
My mom was. "Whoa!"

321
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.640
There was wires everywhere
and all the rest of it.

322
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.320
And then. that-that was hard.
I felt it then. really.

323
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.080
Um... Sorry.

324
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
So...

325
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.920
[Dr Nadir]
As we opened the head.
we found a large clot.

326
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.800
But if you
cut off the blood vessel.

327
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.320
then that part
of the brain dies.

328
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.840
So. sometimes you
just apply pressure and wait.

329
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.720
And so. I do remember waiting.
and waiting.

330
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.720
And after a while.
the bleeding stopped.

331
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.760
The brain started resurfacing.

332
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.120
which I thought
was a good sign.

333
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.680
I think that day there was
five brain hemorrhages.

334
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.520
That day I was-- and three died.

335
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.680
Only two survived.
I was one of them.

336

So. you know.
you know you're lucky.

337
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.440

I always remember that.

338

And you're looking out

and you're...

339
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.960
and you're saying.
I wonder if I'll ever see--

I'm ever going to see again?

"There's a really nice girl.
just started."

349
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.640
I just saw him walking through.

350
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.720
I'd suffered an injury
at football and I had
a plaster on my face.

351
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.160
She thought I was either
a gangster or a boxer.

I thought he was a thug.

353
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.000
Then I found out
that he was a footballer.

354
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.760
But that didn't make--
didn't make him
any different to me. [chuckles]

she was Catholic.

Well. we're different religions.

and. uh. that was too much.
you know.

His mind was trying to
keep up with everybody.

498

so he was doing too much
with the brain.

499
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.720
And then. he had a lapse.
Uh. quite a-a bad lapse.

He was really upset with that

506
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.240
because he thought
he was going to lose his voice.

507

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.320
I don't know who you are
or who my wife is.

512
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.520
In many ways.
that would've been the worst
thing that could've happened.

513
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.840
Surviving.
but losing the memory.

514
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.360
Two of the doctors came in
and they just said. "Write."

515
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.680
You know. gave me a pen.
write names.
Write your family's name.

516
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.640
Write your friend's name.
Write your football
team's names.

517
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.600
Write your players names.

518
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.880
And I just kept writing.
and writing. and writing.

519
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.760
And I'm thinking. "He's writing
quite a long time here".

520
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.360
And I went. "Right. okay.
Let's have a look".

521
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.680
So I took the book off him.
and he's like that.

522
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.680
He was like a little boy.
really. to be honest.

523
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.200
[Alex] Aye.

524
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.680
It's impossible to read this.

525
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.840
"The remember that.
remember that.
that had remember...

526
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.720
the remember. that remember.
that has had remember."

527
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.600
I've repeated the word
"remember" three times there.

528
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360
Yeah.

529
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120
God.

530
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.400
Regarding my health.
I'm not actually in control.

531
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.720
in the football world...
and at-at United.

532
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.000
I'm in control
of the situation.

533
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.120
It's vital.

534
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.960
Because... a player
can't do it himself.

535
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.920
A player's only part of a team.

536
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.680
The manager's
in control of that.

537
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.360
He's in control
of all that destiny.

538
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.600
Dealing with the press.

539
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.000
with referees.

540
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.080
with rivals.

541
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.080
I've got to make decisions
that are correct.

542
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.520
You have to make
really difficult decisions.

543
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.040
I'm telling you.
I was never afraid of that.

544
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.320
I never looked back.

545
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.760
I never looked back
because there was
always tomorrow

546
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.800
as far as I was concerned.
whether you lose or win.

547
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.280
There was always tomorrow.

548
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.480
But. now. if you remember.
we spoke about reflecting.

549
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.760
Um. I've done a lot
of reflecting on things.
uh. that I achieved

550
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.760
and what I didn't achieve.
and I think that's been.

551
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.280
has been quite a challenge.
actually.

552
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.840
Because you're-you're
searching your memory.

553
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.840
And that's what I've had to do.

554
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.480
[man] Aberdeen.

555
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.880
The Granite City.

556
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.320
The silver city by the sea.

557
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.520
[Alex]
I'd been part-time manager

558
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.240
for three and a half years
at St. Mirren.

559
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.680
I was offered the job
to be full-time manager
at Aberdeen.

560
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.000
I snapped at it.

561
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.560
And. uh. I had my own
philosophy about management.

562
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.000
Hold it there.
Come on. big man Dougie.

563
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.840
Get that thigh on the chest.

564
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.040
-Hold it.
-[man] Don't move.

565
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.440
Feel the back of your legs.

566
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.480
Hold it for a wee bit.

567
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.840
Obviously. I've got
my own ideas and standards.

568
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.360
And through time.
this'll come through
to the players.

569
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.720
Fingers crossed.

570
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.040
[man]
When he first got there...

571
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.880
Well. we're at the level
where Aberdeen had been
for years.

572
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.280
Where you--
The fans are quite happy if you
won a trophy every six years.

573
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.320
And that trophy was either
the League Cup or the F.A. Cup.

574
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960
That was success.

575
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.880
We were a group of guys.

576
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.400
play football
just to make a living.

577
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.240
[Alex] But the problem was.

578
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.440
a lot of those players
couldn't dream
of winning a league.

579
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.920
And incredible as it may seem.

580
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.280
we didn't have
a training ground at Aberdeen.

581
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.640
Facilities?
There's a park along from us

582
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.920
[boys chattering]

583
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.560
[Gordon] That wasn't that great
because you had to

584
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.320
kick off the dog crap. uh.

585
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.760
before you started training.

586
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.840
Yeah. the car park was used
mainly in the afternoons.

587
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.120
We used to go to the beach.

588
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.160
And we'd only stop when
the actual tide hit a goalpost.

589
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.720
-[chuckles]
-[chattering]

590
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.080
But the only thing that mattered
was beating Rangers and Celtic.

591
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.720
If you don't
beat Rangers and Celtic.
you don't win the league.

592
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.120
Simple as that.

593
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.760
[Gordon]
I remember. he was desperate.

594
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.960
I mean.
desperate to beat the two sides.
the Old Firm sides.

595
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.760
Rangers. I felt in particular
more than Celtic.

596
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.600
For some reason.
I don't know what it was.

597
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.560
But Rangers
was the first target.

598
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.560
[Alex] The first time
we played at Rangers...

599
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.240
and we scrambled a draw
in the last minute.

600
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.320
After the game. the players
were all celebrating.
jumping up and down.

601
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.120
And I'm. what.
I'm saying. "Wait a minute".

602
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.000
I says.
"What are you celebrating?
I mean... you've only drawn."

603
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.200
And we'd all had kind of...
rollockings or bollockings.

604
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.320
whatever you want to call it.
before at different clubs.

605
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.160
But this was an intensity

606
00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.120
that was not about
just that game or something.

607
00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.560
It was... everything.

608
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.040
Where you want to go.
what you want to do
with your life.

609
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.120
Forget all the work
we'd been doing.

610
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.760
with passing the ball
and technical ability.
etcetera. etcetera.

611
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.840
If they're not winners.
it's a waste of time anyway.

612
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.400
You're trying to
get that character

613
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.040
instilled in the human beings
you're dealing with.

614
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.840
When they go on that pitch.
they can't leave

615
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.800
their personality
in the dressing room.

616
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.800
When I looked at that.
I thought there's-there's

617
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.560
something up here.

618
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.320
Somehow there's something
inside this fellow...

619
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.280
that's making him angry
and driving him.

620
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.160
Well. looking back on it now.

621
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.480
it looks like I bumped into
a-a wounded animal here.

622
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.920
Look. rather than explain

623
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.120
how you can bring-bring
a winning mentality to people.

624
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.520
I think you've got to produce
a project that's working.

625
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.640
[Gordon] Technique. mentally.
physically. the whole lot.

626
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.080
-[player grunts]
-He put people
under so much pressure

627
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.040
to be successful.

628
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.560
[Alex]
You have to earn the right

629
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.080
to be an Aberdeen player

630
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.040
that I was looking for.

631
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.960
The coaching
and the speed of their play.

632
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.720
the concentration...

633
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.920
If you're
doing these things right.

634
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.520
it definitely develops
their mind better.

635
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.440
Deep down inside us
there's a devil
that drives you on.

636
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.360
Um. for whatever reason.

637
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.800
he could make
that devil materialise
for a game of football.

638
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.640
[announcer]
McMaster through to Harper.

639
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.160
Harper's left foot
out in front.

640
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.480
It's going to be a goal!

641
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.120
Yes. it's over! It's a goal!

642
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.800
[crowd cheering]

643
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.440
And. sensationally.
Aberdeen lead one-nil.

644
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.200
It was really a turning point

645
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.760
because the players
are now saying to themselves.

646
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.320
"Right. let's get after Celtic."

647
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.680
That's the one
we were after now.

648
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.480
[announcer]
Archibald and a chance.
and he scores!

649
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.600
Archibald scores!

650
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.840
There's a cross
aimed for Archibald.

651
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.840
Latchford drops it.
Strachan scores.

652
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.640
Strachan makes it three-one.

653
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.760
Yeah. He-he brought
the devil out in me.

654
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.760
You think. "Oh. we're in here."
That was the hardest bit.

655
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.920
Because. um...
Sir Alex had never won
that league before.

656
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.360
None of us had won
that league before.
So. it was all new to us.

657
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.160
And how we dealt with it.

658
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.680
And at that point. the manager
was the most important guy.

659
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:54.240
'cause we were
looking at him for guidance
how to get through it.

660
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.360
[host] Now. having beaten Celtic
twice in the past month.

661
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.080
is it all about conviction?

662
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.920
Believing in yourselves
that you-you can actually do it?

663
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.480
Because I've met infinite number
of Aberdonians who say.

664
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.120
"Ah. yes. They're a good team.
but they haven't won
anything yet."

665
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.520
Conviction and belief
is built up in-in time.

666
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.680
Uh...

667
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.600
Mainly with the work
that I do myself
with the players in. you know.

668
00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.960
on their character
and their discipline.
and having belief in themselves

669
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.080
and conviction
in going to places
like Celtic Park and Ibrox.

670
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.400
and believing they can win.

671
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.000
-[cheering]
-[announcer] Oh. that's a goal!

672
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.560
Steve Archibald!

673
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.800
Scanlon... Yes!

674
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.360
What a marvelous goal
to finish this match!

675
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.440
And that's it! They have won!

676
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.080
Alec Ferguson is on now
in the penalty area!

677

Oh. it was a nightmare.

Um. and it was--
It was like most managers

Well. it used to be Sir Alex.
bad cop.

That was his job.

Well. he got on with his job.
and I got on with the kids.

702

he's-he's always at work.

more time with you.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.080
[female announcer] And the man
who's going to replace him

848
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.040
is Aberdeen's Alex Ferguson.

849
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.440
[male announcer]
1986 has been United's

850
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.640
worst start to the season
since the war.

851
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.920
[male announcer]
The camera shutters
and the microphones strained

852
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.240
at the first appearance
of the new boss.

853
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.800
[male announcer]
Manchester United
is the most famous name

854
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.480
in English football.
There's no bigger news.

855
00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.160
If there is a man.
is he the man to follow you?

856
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.120
Yes. I'd have to be honest.
If I'd have been the chairman

857
00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.920
and I'd have got rid of
somebody like me.
I'd have taken him.

858
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.280
[Cathy]
Moving across the border was.
you know. going to the moon.

859
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:54.200
And I wasn't-- I wasn't happy
because I didn't want to
leave Aberdeen.

860
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.440
But I knew there was no way
he would refuse that job.

861
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.000
[camera shutter clicking]

862
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.160
[man] We've brought Alec
down from Scotland this morning.

863
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.600
Perhaps. we'd like to go
straight into the questions.

864
00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.360
[male reporter]
You've come here with the club
19th in the First Division.

865
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.880
We need to look at
the facts for themselves.

866
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.120
We haven't won the League
for 20 years. right?

867
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.000
That is a great challenge
for the Manchester United
players.

868
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.800
and will be until it's achieved.

869
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.200
And the only way we can win
the European Cup
is by winning the League.

870
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.960
Because that's
the great desire.

871
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.160
[Alex] And my first day there.

872
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.280
I went to Old Trafford.

873
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.560
Even though
it was an empty stadium.

874
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.440
you can feel
the spirit of the place.

875
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.040
It's like a theatre
with ghosts walking about it.

876
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.720
Memories.

877
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.200
[male announcer]
Matt Busby. the maestro
of Manchester United...

878
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.400
This is the place
where they've created...

879
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.240
Gods.

880
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.600
[male announcer]
The manager. Matt Busby.
transformed the whole approach

881
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.440
to modern day football
with his commitment
to a youth policy.

882
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.000
I have a scouting system
whose sole object is to go out

883
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.520
looking for young.
promising school boys.

884
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.320
youth club boys.
and indeed. any young players.

885
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.120
[male announcer]
Manchester United were supreme
soccer champions of Europe!

886
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.480
[Alex]
Matt Busby doing what he did

887
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.040
to bring all these young
players into your first team.

888
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.520
this is what I believed in.
This is what I was good at.

889
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.960
This is what I wanted to do.

890
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.360
[Alex] So. it was question
time.

891
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.560
What do I really need
to resurrect the club?

892
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.560
One way of doing it
was the proper youth system.

893
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.760
That can be the spirit
of the place.

894
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.440
The new spirit.

895
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.960
I had a meeting
with Brian Whitehouse
who was the reserve coach.

896
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.520
And a meeting
with Eric Harrison.

897
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.360
And they were
Ron Atkinson's men. of course.

898
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.800
They had a youth game.
I think it was second
or third week there.

899
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.120
They were shocking Jason.
they were shocking.

900
00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.560
I went in
after the dressing room.
I couldn't stand it.

901
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.200
And I went berserk with them.

902
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.280
And I knew Eric was not pleased.
Eric was not pleased.

903
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.360
And he came to see me
the next day.

904
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.200
He says. "Look. that's my job.

905
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.080
I've never known a manager
to come in."

906
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.840
And I says. "Yeah. but you've
never known a manager like me."

907
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.800
The first thing he did. was we
got all the scouts together.

908
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.920
I'd only two scouts
in Manchester.

909
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.040
And he says. "We need to do
something about that."

910
00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.480
So my job was to...

911
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.880
flood Manchester with scouts.

912
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:09.080
So as he could have his way
of building a football club.

913
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.560
from the bottom up.

914
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.320
[Alex] We had to make a mark
on Manchester itself.

915
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.880
It was only a few weeks
after I arrived.
and. um. there was a steward.

916
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.960
Says.
"Boss. there's a young lad.

917
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
He's training with Man City.
he's a United fan.

918
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.800
He's an absolutely
fantastic player.

919
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.840
and we're doing nothing
about it."

920
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.120
So I went to see him.

921
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.800
[man] I did notice him
while I was playing.

922
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.640
"The Man United manager.
what's going on there?"

923
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.920
It just doesn't happen.
It just doesn't happen.

924
00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.680
[indistinct shouting]

925
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.520
[Alex] You see him
dancing over the pitch.

926
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.560
You know...

927
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.560
[shouting]

928
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.160
[Alex] Sensational.

929
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.880
Feet. very narrow.
Balance. fantastic.

930
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.760
We got him signed.

931
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.600
He was a breath of fresh air.
he really was.

932
00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.840
So... he was the future.

933
00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.480
[indistinct shouting]

934
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.200
But putting that aside.

935
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.880
you need results
in your first team.

936
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.600
But I knew that.

937
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.160
When you look round that squad.
it was just
a dysfunctional unit.

938
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.120
"Fifth of March. 1988.

939
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.160
Lost 1-0 at Norwich.
Absolutely shocking display."

940
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.800
[male announcer]
Manchester United
conspicuous by their absence.

941
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.280
[Alex] "Sunday. had the players
in for a talk."

942
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.120
[male announcer]
Manchester United
have won nothing since '85.

943
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.560
It's not good enough.

944
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.040
[Alex] "Lost 1-0 to Liverpool.

945
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.880
Shocker of a game."

946
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.160
[male announcer] Alec Ferguson.
his team in severe problems.

947
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.640
[Alex] "Lost 2-1.
Team is lacking confidence."

948
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.680
Did it affect
your confidence at all?

949
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.320
Lack of success
affects everyone's confidence.

950
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.400
Did you know the pressures
were going to be quite as great

951
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.960
when you left Scotland?

952
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.640
No. No. I didn't--
I didn't realise that.

953
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.080
[Alex] "Lost two-nil
to Southampton.
Totally disgusting."

954
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.240
[male announcer]
A beleaguered manager.

955
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.840
[Alex] "Sunday. Frustrated."

956
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.600
[Alex]
"Saturday. 23rd of September.
V Man City."

957
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.720
[male announcer]
United all over the place!
Morley!

958
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.360
[audience screaming]

959
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.280
[Alex] "Lost 5-1."

960
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.400
[male announcer] Alex Ferguson
won three championships
with Aberdeen in Scotland.

961
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.560
But he's finding it
a far more difficult prize

962
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.200
to get his hands on
south of the border.

963
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.120
[Alex]
I remember after the game...

964
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.360
I got home.

965
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.760
I just stayed in my bed.
you know?

966
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.280
Probably the best place to be.

967
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.360
[car door closes]

968
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.400
I'd been there
for over three years.

969
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.800
and that's when the cries
were coming out. you know?

970
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.280
Fergie out.

971
01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.720
[crowd chanting]
Fergie out! Fergie out!

972
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.000
Fergie out!
Fergie out! Fergie out!

973
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.520
[chanting continues]

974
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.960
[chanting continues]

975
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.720
We got calls into the house.
I remember that. yeah. I do.

976
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.360
You know.
"Go back to fucking Scotland."
and all that.

977
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.640
"You're fucking useless."

978
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.280
I would just
put the phone down. you know.

979
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.840
And Cathy
got a bit upset with it.

980
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.600
[Cathy] You were getting
abusive phone calls.

981
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.480
I found that really hard.

982
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.320
It would have just been
like a tightening
of a screw on her.

983
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.640
It was just
an instrument of torture.

984
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.920
[Cathy]
I got sort of a. paranoid.

985
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.680
The magpies drove me crazy.

986
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.840
One for sorrow. two for joy.
so if you only saw one
before a game.

987
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.760
I mean I-I used to be
looking for the other.
[chuckles]

988
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.760
I went to him.
and so did my brothers.

989
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.440
and I just said.
"Dad. it's not working.

990
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.360
You're not going to
be able to succeed here.

991
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.080
You know. it's-it's--
you know. it's killing us.

992
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.880
and I just don't think
you're going to be successful."

993
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.560
And for his eldest son
to have basically gone and said.

994
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.280
"We don't believe in you.
You're going to fail.
You need to give up."

995
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.040
which is not quite what I said.
but it's what I meant.

996
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.480
And he said. "I really think
I can succeed here.
I really think we're close."

997
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.200
And I was like. "Oh. deluded.
What are you thinking?"

998
01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.000
[Alex] "January 1st. good luck!
F.A. Cup."

999
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.560
[male announcer]
For Manchester United.
Sunday's match

1000
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.680
at Nottingham Forest
has been looming.

1001
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.280
[male announcer]
United are going to Forest

1002
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.640
currently fifth bottom
of the First Division.

1003
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.920
[male announcer]
It's being billed
as Alex Ferguson's last stand.

1004
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.480
His Alamo.

1005
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.960
[Alex] The day before.

1006
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.480
Martin Edwards. the chairman.

1007
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.600
called me up to his office.

1008
01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.920
And he says. "Doesn't matter
what happens on Sunday.

1009
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.720
you'll still be the manager.
I can assure you of that."

1010
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.600
And that was good of him
to do that.

1011
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.040
Now. that's not to say.
that was cast in stone. that.

1012
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.000
Because if the crowds
had gone down.

1013
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.400
and we end up at the bottom
of the league. you're away.

1014
01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.920
I could half agree
with the club if they said.
"Well. we've had enough."

1015
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.440
[male announcer]
Alec Ferguson. who celebrated
his 48th birthday last week.

1016
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.920
And I suspect
in the last seven weeks.
he's aged a bit more than that.

1017
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.600
[male announcer]
OÖrlygsson. kept in by Martin.

1018
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.040
Hughes. he's got a lot of room.

1019
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.280
And here's Robins!

1020
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.040
[audience cheering]

1021
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960
[male announcer]
United are through!

1022
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.520
Some joy at last
for Alec Ferguson.

1023
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.320
There's a smile on the face
of the United manager.

1024
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.360
After so many problems.
at least. they've won
this crunch-match.

1025
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.080
[Alex] That was a pivotal game.

1026
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.960
And of course. we were
struggling in the league.

1027
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.040
But now the F.A. Cup
was keeping us alive. you know.

1028
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.720
[male announcer]
Yes! Manchester United
are at Wembley.

1029
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.920
[audience cheering]

1030
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.080
[Alex] We got to
the-the Cup Final.

1031
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.640
But I had a
big problem in my mind.

1032
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280
Jim Leighton.

1033
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.840
Jim was having a horrid time.

1034
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.520
[male announcer]
Long range shot...

1035
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.360
Oh! A mistake
there by Jim Leighton.

1036
01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960
[Alex] Jim...

1037
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.040
I gave him
his debut at Aberdeen.

1038
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.320
I brought him to United.

1039
01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.120
[male announcer]
Alex Ferguson said he is
the best goalkeeper in Britain.

1040
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.800
[Alex] At Aberdeen...
did well for me.

1041
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.560
[male announcer] And once
again.
Leighton is Aberdeen's hero!

1042
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.960
Fantastic goalkeeper. Jim.
Top. top goalkeeper.

1043
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.440
[Jim] The fact that
I'm supposed to be the best
goalkeeper in Scotland.

1044
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.320
you get a lot more respect.
Plus. the confidence has done me

1045
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.040
an awful lot of good as well.

1046
01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.200
-[audience cheering]
-[Alex] But now...

1047
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.320
He didn't seem to have the same
confidence about himself.

1048
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.640
[male announcer]
There's the man. Alex Ferguson.

1049
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.240
[audience cheering
and applauding]

1050
01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.200
[male announcer]
Free kick to Crystal Palace.

1051
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.040
Andy Gray's back
on his feet to take it.

1052
01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.240
[male announcer]
Thorn. O'Reilly's in there!

1053
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.600
And was it over the line?

1054
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640
And it's a goal!

1055
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.480
[Alex] He was making mistake
after mistake.

1056
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.000
[male announcer] Wright! Goal!

1057
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.840
[audience cheering]

1058
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.520
[male announcer]
And the referee has blown.

1059
01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.880
and the F.A. Cup Final of 1990
ends in a draw.

1060
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.240
[announcer 2]
And they'll have to come back

1061
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.760
and do it
all again on Thursday.

1062
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240
But after the game.
Jim's like that.

1063
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.520
Head was right down. right down.

1064
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.320
It got to that point
that you say to yourself.

1065
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.280
"I have to pick a team
that's going to win the Cup."

1066
01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.080
I don't think Jim's
part of my thinking in that.

1067
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.120
So. we had a wee bit
of an argument about that.

1068
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.680
He would've played him again.
Archie. He would've.

1069
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.080
But he knew he was only doing it
through his loyalty to Jim.

1070
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.280
I just said that.
"Oh. well. you know.
that'll finish Big Jim."

1071
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.400
[Alex] When there's a doubt.
there's no doubt.

1072
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.160
And I-- I'd made my mind up.
I'd made my mind up.

1073
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.360
I then went to Jim's room.

1074
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.720
And I told him.
and he burst out crying.

1075
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.520
[male announcer]
So. the big news is
that Jim Leighton is dropped.

1076
01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.920
A major decision
by Alex Ferguson
to drop a goalkeeper

1077
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.560
who played in so many
Scottish Cup finals for him.

1078
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.240
And on it may hinge
an awful lot of futures.

1079
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.120
And Les Sealey
gets a surprise call-up.

1080
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.120
[Alex] Sealey was not
as good a goalkeeper.

1081
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.160
But he thought he was. you know?

1082
01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.680
[male announcer]
Pardew closing in
and so was Mark Bright.

1083
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.840
And that's the first test
for Les Sealey.

1084
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.560
And Les Sealey does well.

1085
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.520
And it's Gray. Oh!
Saved by Sealey's legs!
That's a good stop!

1086
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.360
The goalkeeper
takes credit again.

1087
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.040
Lee Martin.
inspired run on the far side.
A chance here... and a goal!

1088
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.400
Manchester United
have won the F.A. Cup!

1089
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.560
Alex Ferguson's first
major trophy at Old Trafford.

1090
01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.720
And just look
at that man's face!

1091
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.840
The years seem to have
fallen away there
from Alex Ferguson.

1092
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.360
after a season of torment
and tribulation.

1093
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.800
[Alex] Making big decisions
affecting players' careers...

1094
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200
is not easy.

1095
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.160
He might have
called it ruthless.

1096
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.880
[interviewer] Do you still feel
a Manchester United player?

1097
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.480
I don't think--
they days are gone now.

1098
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.520
-[interviewer] Really?
-I think so. yeah.

1099
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.760
I think from both sides.
those days are gone now.

1100
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.760
Never spoke to me again.

1101
01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.960
Yeah... so...

1102
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.040
You lose a friend. or you lose

1103
01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.640
someone that you'd given
his first opportunity in life.

1104
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.120
But make no mistake.
it was the correct decision.

1105
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:07.000
[audience cheering]

1106
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.360
-[Jason] Want some water?
-I'm all right.

1107
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.480
[Jason] Okay.

1108
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.680
[Alex] I got home.

1109
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.640
All the things that were
bottling up inside me...

1110
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.760
it was a sort of.
uh. opening up.

1111
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.160
You know. you just
want to spill it all out.

1112
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.640
[Jason] I don't know
if you want to kick off?

1113
01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.320
No. I think that. um...

1114
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.680
[clears throat]

1115
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.320
It's been an experience.
I think that...

1116
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.320
What I-- what you realise is...

1117
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.840
that what happens when you die.

1118
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.320
is it... people suffer cancer.

1119
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.240
and there's a long period
before they do.

1120
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.920
But when it happens like that.
they say it's the best way
to go.

1121
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.240
But you don't remember anything.

1122
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.840
When I collapsed
that Saturday morning.

1123
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.360
and I had no idea
from that moment on.
what-what happened.

1124
01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.600
People say that I was
sitting up talking
in Macclesfield Hospital.

1125
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.360
before I went to Royal Salford.

1126
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.920
But I don't remember a thing.
So...

1127
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.720
I'm not sure when the moment
comes and you do die.

1128
01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.960
whether it's the best way to go.

1129
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.760
In the moments
when you're on your own.

1130
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.560
there's that fear
and there's that loneliness.

1131
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.000
That creeps
into your mind and...

1132
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.520
you don't want to die.
You know.
and that's where I was at.

1133
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.360
I don't want to.
I'm not gonna die.
I don't want to die.

1134
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.000
These things did flash
through my mind quite a lot.

1135
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.560
[Cathy]
They had wanted him to go

1136
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.400
to the first game
of the season at Old Trafford.

1137
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.480
But Dr George says no.
it was too much. you know.

1138
01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.120
Far too much. And we said that
ourselves. you know.

1139
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.120
'Cause everybody's going to be--
Cameras. everything. you know.

1140
01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.840
I have a slight concern
about going to watch
United again

1141
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.400
in terms of the first time.

1142
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.600
[Alex] A third of my life
has been at United.

1143
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.720
creating a certain type
of football club.

1144
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.840
But you're still walking into
a sort of. uh. an unknown...

1145
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.000
situation for yourself.

1146
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.240
Somewhere inside you.
you know. there's a doubt.

1147
01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.440
[chattering]

1148
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.040
[Alex] A long-term approach
always suited me.

1149
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.240
to go the long road
to shape my future.

1150
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.840
[male announcer] And number 14
is 17-year old Ryan Giggs.

1151
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.680
Manchester United believe
we may be seeing the start

1152
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.920
of a very special career
here this afternoon.

1153
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.440
[Alex]
If you get them young enough.

1154
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.280
and breed the important values

1155
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.160
of what you're trying to
achieve with them.

1156
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.360
they became that particular
person you were looking for.

1157
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.000
Do you have to treat them.
you know. differently to-to
the established stars?

1158
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.560
Absolutely. You've got to be
real hard on them.

1159
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.160
Because they're facing for
the first time in their lives...

1160
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.720
-[interviewer] Harder on them?
-Oh. yes.

1161
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.560
-[interviewer] Really?
-Absolutely.

1162
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.120
They're facing for
the first time in their lives.
media attention.

1163
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.920
And you won't get the crit--
you don't get
any criticism from journalism

1164
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.080
to young boys. It's all praise.

1165
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.440
-That's ahead.
-Do you sometimes feel
like a bully?

1166
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.320
No. no. no. no!
I think they realise
that it's for their own good.

1167
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.360
[Ryan]
My Dad left when I was 14.

1168
01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.080
I had two mainstays in my life:

1169
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.320
my granddad and the manager.

1170
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.960
There was definitely
that father-son relationship.

1171
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.480
Um. sometimes that was good.

1172
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.880
sometimes that was bad
because he felt he could
say whatever he wanted.

1173
01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.040
Um. which was tough to take.
especially when you're
an 18. 19 year-old.

1174
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.960
[no dialogue]

1175
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.920
[Ryan]
Honestly. sometimes. you know.

1176
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.920
he would have fights
with the players.
or nearly have fights.

1177
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.960
I wanted to. because he
would be right in your face.

1178
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.080
screaming at you.

1179
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.400
[Jason] To the outside world.
you've got this reputation...

1180
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.760
as this fearsome character.

1181
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.200
Yeah. absolutely.

1182
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.080
That fearsome character

1183
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.960
has been portrayed
throughout my career.

1184
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.920
I mean... [stutters]
That's the baggage
I've had to carry.

1185
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.320
[Jason]
Maybe times when you felt.

1186
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.200
"Oh. went maybe
a bit too far there."

1187
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.640
Oh. there'd be plenty times.

1188
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.840
[Alex] But...

1189
01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.040
I don't think there's anything
wrong with losing your temper

1190
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.600
if it's for the right reasons.
you know?

1191
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.960
Where they didn't reach
their expectation in a game.

1192
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
because everything's
built around what we expect

1193
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.960
in terms of the standard
of our training.

1194
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.280
and the ambitions
of the football club.

1195
01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.560
Because my experience
of human beings...

1196
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.360
they'd like to do things
the easiest way.

1197
01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.920
The minute you-you accept
a bad performance from them.

1198
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.800
or a bad technical aspect
of their training.

1199
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.880
they'll do it again.

1200
01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.920
[Ryan]
I remember. against Juventus.

1201
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.840
I spent the whole half.
I mean. which is what I did.
dribbling. and yeah.

1202
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.920
Conte was taking it off me.
And they were going on
and attacking.

1203
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.160
And I wasn't having a good game.

1204
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.160
At half time.

1205
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.200
and the manager
just went for me straight away.

1206
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.280
"Stop dribbling in midfield."
And this argument started.
and...

1207
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.680
I've got these
blackcurrant drinks

1208
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.120
that we used to have
at half-time.
and I threw it.

1209
01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.440
Threw it right
at the gaffer's feet.

1210
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.520
[male announcer]
So Giggs is off.

1211
01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.000
[Ryan] He was always in
control.

1212
01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.880
You were never in any doubt.
who was the boss.

1213
01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.160
Yeah. I could be.

1214
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.600
I could be ferocious

1215
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.120
in terms of my criticism
after games.

1216
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.960
But sometimes
I never said a word to them.

1217
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.040
Sometimes I would gather them
altogether.

1218
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.960
and I never
made myself predictable.

1219
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.000
[Ryan] But away from football.

1220
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.480
he would sometimes spot
if there was something wrong.

1221
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.200
"Is everything okay at home?
You know you
can always talk to me."

1222
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.480
That was comforting to me.
That was comforting to me

1223
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.120
that no matter
how many arguments we have.

1224
01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.720
how many-- if I wasn't
playing well. if he dropped me.

1225
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.720
that I could always come
and talk about things.

1226
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.560
Because then.
it wasn't about football.

1227
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.600
It was about
how you are as a human being.

1228
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.520
[Alex] It wasn't as if
I was their best pal.

1229
01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.800
But they always knew I would
find a way to help them.

1230
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.200
If you want to be
the proper manager.

1231
01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.320
and be in control of a unit
as big as that...

1232
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.840
you have to know them all.

1233
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.440
All these different people...

1234
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.680
with all these
different stories.

1235
01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.200
[man] I wasn't happy.
so I just reacted.

1236
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.320
It wasn't really the football
I dreamed about.

1237
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.000
Just lost that passion
for the game.

1238
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.240
[Alex] I always remember.
I'd gone to a game in Paris.

1239
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.480
And I was sitting between
Michel Platini
and Gerard Houllier.

1240
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.400
And right out of the blue.

1241
01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.200
Michel says. "Why don't you
sign Eric Cantona?"

1242
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.360
And I says. "Well. isn't there
a bit of baggage there?"

1243
01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.520
And Michel says.
"Look. he's a great lad.

1244
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.080
He just needs to be understood."

1245
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.000
[male announcer] Football.
And Manchester United
have signed

1246
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.240
the French international
striker. Eric Cantona.

1247
01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.880
[chattering]

1248
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.240
[interviewer] You shocked
everybody with the signing.

1249
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.520
He's got a fiery reputation.
A fiery Frenchman.

1250
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.120
and with due respect.
a fiery Scot.

1251
01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.440
How's that relationship
going to develop?

1252
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.280
I think that hopefully
I've got the experience
to handle it.

1253
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.480
It's maybe a new challenge
for me. too.

1254
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.320
-[interviewer] Is it a gamble?
-No. I don't think
it's a gamble.

1255
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.840
[Alex] When I met Eric.

1256
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.480
I said to myself. "Right.
I'm going to forget his past.

1257
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.640
I'm not going to mention
any of his behavior.
It didn't matter."

1258
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.960
What mattered to me was

1259
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.720
what we could do
in terms of bringing him
into our fold.

1260
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.360
Like. a new kid.
as if he was an apprentice.
or a newborn baby.

1261
01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.440
It was to give him
that opportunity to be himself.

1262
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.080
In anything I do in my life.
if I don't feel free...

1263
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.160
I become crazy.

1264
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.960
He knew exactly what I needed.
psychologically.

1265
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.680
More than a manager.

1266
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:08.720
Somebody strong enough to deal
with any kind of personality.

1267
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.040
[Ryan] He was just
treated differently.

1268
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.040
Black tie do.

1269
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.400
I walked in.
my top button's undone.
manager's gone straight for me.

1270
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.880
"Get your top button done!
You're representing Man United!"

1271
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.360
Two minutes later.
I'm sulking in the corner.

1272
01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.720
"Flipping heck. he's just had
a go at me. again."

1273
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.880
Um. Eric walks in
with a white linen suit

1274
01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.240
with white/red
Tiempo Nike trainers on.

1275
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.480
So I am like.
flipping rubbing my hands.
"What's he gonna say?"

1276
01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.480
So he goes over.
shakes his hand.
and then turns to us and go.

1277
01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.240
"Lads. that's style."

1278
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.800
But...

1279
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:51.040
when-- when they--
somebody like Alex Ferguson
give you the freedom you need...

1280
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.240
to express yourself.

1281
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.280
you have to deserve it. yeah.

1282
01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.480
And you know how lucky you are
to have this freedom.

1283
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.680
It's why I worked...

1284
01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.800
so hard and I tried everything.

1285
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.240
Everything--
I could give my life to him.

1286
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.400
He was. and is still
a great psychologist.

1287
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.280
[Alex] Psychology
is someone else's word.

1288
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.640
I call it...

1289
01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.760
management.

1290
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.200
[announcer]
Cantona's looping header...
And a goal!

1291
01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.760
[audience cheering]

1292
01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.960
[announcer]
Cantona. Oh. look at that pass!

1293
01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.640
Oh. that's brilliant!

1294
01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.680
[Eric]
It was like a dream for me.

1295
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.600
That's the football
I dreamed about.

1296
01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.800
And the spirit around football
I dreamed about.

1297
01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:01.600
I think that was
the first time of my life
I felt like it was my place.

1298
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.120
That's my house.

1299
01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.400
[announcer] And here's Giggs.

1300
01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.800
Over the goalkeeper. Cantona!

1301
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.960
[audience cheering]

1302
01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:16.520
Eric came at the right time
to lift United.

1303
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.120
[announcer] Eric Cantona.
who was only 11 and a half
months old

1304
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.120
the last time Manchester United
won the title.

1305
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:25.000
We are going to do it.
It is going to happen.

1306
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.240
[announcer]
Bruce. yes! Unbelievable.

1307
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.120
There's still a bit to be done.

1308
01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.240
but Alec Ferguson almost
celebrating the championship.

1309
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.880
[announcer]
And he's going to the right.
away from the marker.

1310
01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.520
-Ince! Yes? that's it!
-[audience cheering]

1311
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.120
Get in. you beauty kiddo!

1312
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.600
[announcer]
Good evening from Old Trafford.

1313
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.960
There hasn't been
a night here like this

1314
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
for over a quarter of a century.

1315
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.880
But once again.
Manchester United
are the champions.

1316
01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.640
It's been a long. long wait

1317
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.840
since those days
of Best and Law and Charlton.

1318
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.680
[singing and cheering]

1319
01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.800
[Alex] It was unbelievable.
the relief.

1320
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.880
It was tangible.
That frustration
of 26 years had gone.

1321
01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.280
This was a club
that had come alive again.

1322
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.440
-[cheering]
-[announcer]
The champions of England!

1323
01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.000
The ultimate accolade
for all players.

1324
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.800
[Alex] You could--
you could smell the roses.

1325
01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.440
You could smell the roses.

1326
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.960
There's no question about that.

1327
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.080
And. um.
it was non-stop after that.

1328
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.040
[announcer]
Elkins header only goes
to Cantona. A glorious goal!

1329
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.960
[cheering]

1330
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.760
[announcer] Manchester United
have won the double.

1331
01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.600
[Alex] And now. the plan we had
was finally the foundation.

1332
01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.880
[announcer] Oh. beautiful goal

[announcer]
Manchester United
have reached the promised land!

1505
01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.920
[man] I don't believe--

1506
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.400
[screaming]

1507
01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.120
[man] I don't believe it!

1508
01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.480
[Alex] And when
it comes to the final bit...

1509
01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.080
I don't watch the game.
I watch the referee...

1510
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.320
to see him putting
that whistle in his mouth.

1511
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.880
[whistle blows]

1512
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.440
[cheering]

1513
01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.560
[Alex] The game's over.

1514
01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.680
The game was over.

1515
01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.920
God. we've done it.

1516
01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.360
[interviewer] Alex Ferguson.
they put you through the mill.
into injury time.

1517
01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.800
Almost lost the cup.
and you win it.
The new European Champions.

1518
01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:49.000
The treble.
The dream come true for you.

1519
01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.600
Oh. I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
Football. bloody hell.

1520
01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.280
But they never give in.
and that's what won it.

1521
01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.840
[cheering]

1522
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.160
[Alex] You start thinking.

1523
01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.120
where's Cathy?

1524
01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.200
I wonder where she is.

1525
01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.000
Cathy.

1526
01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.160
The period in the hospital.

1527
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.240
I wrote letters. yeah.

1528
01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.040
I wrote down
what I wanted to say to Cathy.

1529
01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.520
That's right.

1530
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.520
"I am proud of you. Cathy.
and your determination.

1531
01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.000
All your years.

1532
01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.280
you've shown great strength.

1533
01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.960
But my heart
should pray for life.

1534
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.680
I don't give up.

1535
01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.640
I was weak and lonely
and miss you. your light.

1536
01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.520
My sons and you I'm proud of.

1537
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.280
You brought up
the way in control
and inspection in school.

1538
01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.800
I wasn't able.
but I was too busy working."

1539
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.400
Mm. Amazing that...

1540
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.840
It's an abbreviation
of my life really.

1541
01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.680
It's maybe an apology really
for not always being there.

1542
01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.680
Uh. and I think...

1543
01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.040
I think that's what
the letter's about. really.

1544
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.920
She is an amazing woman.

1545
01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.680
She really is
the catalyst of all.

1546
01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.520
She sacrificed to support me
one hundred percent.

1547
01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.080
Fifty-three years married.
you know.

1548
01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.480
That tells you a lot. really.

1549
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.800
You know. there's a lot
of sacrifice comes into that.
And. uh...

1550
01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:10.400
Um. a lot of patience
married to me.
[chuckles]

[crowd cheering]

1552
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.720
[announcer] 1986 was the year

-[Jason]
Was this the greatest moment?
-Definitely.

1557
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.240
Without doubt.
it was my greatest moment
as a manager.

1558
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.960
It's exactly epitomised
all my teams.

1559
01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:02.960
And I look back and...

1560
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.560
say now that-that was.
uh. the spirit.

1561
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:16.280
It was a spirit.
and it was there.
right through to when I left.

1562
01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.200
That night...

1563
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.640
it showed itself.

1564
01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.480
Showed all the qualities
that got you there
in the first place.

1565
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:36.440
They came out that night.
Never give in.

1566
01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.920
Absolutely brilliant.
That's my best ever.

1567
01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:52.840
[Alex] You worry...

1568
01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.840
you'll lose all this history.

1569
01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.720
All these memories.

1570
01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:08.920
But they live on.

1571
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.320
And they'll never be forgotten.
