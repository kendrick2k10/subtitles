is a Danish supermodel.

half-Taiwanese.

for college students

to learn about
Taiwanese culture. right?

786
00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:48.633
Well. one year.
I think back in the '70s.

a big typhoon hit Taipei.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.836
Since then. it's been
a little bit less about learning

and more about love.

803

push their kids to come here.

someone to marry.
