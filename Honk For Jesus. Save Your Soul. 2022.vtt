You know...

19
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.565
Have you ever seen a rat

20
00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.860
go from the inside of a house
to the outside of a house?

21
00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.654
They chew through.

22
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.532
So we're-we're gonna gnaw
through the hardest parts.

23
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.951
I mean. not that
we're rats. obviously.

24
00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:00.370

25
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.918

It's not really mine. no.

49

dip into the Old Testament

a bit more.

TRINITIE:
Mm. Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.754
I like some of
the Old Testament.

77
00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.089
It's got rigor.

78
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.507
Could be good for our new look.

79
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.676
Straddling the new and the old.

80
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.053
I could perfect
a good powerful straddle.

81
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.263
don't you think?

82
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.682

91
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.123

And that's all I intend to do.

107
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.280
Hey. I'm Rocky

Rocky didn't win.

111
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.540
How's that. now?

112
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.125
Well. he-he went the distance.

113
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.670
you know. the whole 15 rounds
against Apollo Creed.

114
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.923
but he didn't...
he didn't actually win.

115
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.012
All right.

116
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.973
But he did win in Rocky II.

117
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.059
Lord. baby. how many times
I got to tell you?

118
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.185
Get past the first movie.

119
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.020
That one's all setup!

120
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.313

Mm.

whew. well.
almost nine years now.

131
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.720
You know. we-we started out
small but just grew like weeds.

132
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.346
-Didn't it. hon?
-LEE-CURTIS: Sure did.

133
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.598
And before long.
we had all this.

134
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.892
That's all through the
blessings of the Lord. though.

135
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:38.314
26.000 members
every single Sunday!

136
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.899
It was a sight to see.

137
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.401
TRINITIE:
Mm-hmm. Yes. it was.

138
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.902
Now. I'm telling y'all.

139
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.238
you should have seen this place
when it was jumping.

140
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.240
Course. it hasn't looked like
that for a while. obviously.

141
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.658
No. No.

142
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.326
But we gonna get that all back.

143
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.619
Oh. yeah. we will.

144
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.788
Have this place looking all--
Oh.

145
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.667
-Shit. Shit!
-Oh. Oh. boy.

146
00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.419
-Oh. my goodness.
-Now. how in the good Lord's

147
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.838
-lush green earth is anybody
supposed to take me... -Okay.

148
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.548
...and the resurrection
of my church seriously if I...

149
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.216
-(clears throat) It-- Yes.
-These are Fianos!

150
00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.677
-Those are-- that's an
Italian brand. -(groans) Sorry.

151
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.263
-So...
-Uh. we can edit around that.

152
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.515
-right. Anita?
-Yeah.

153
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.143
-Can she hear?
-I don't know.

154
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.186
Anita!

155
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.271
Ah. That's right.

156
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.647
Y'all the fly-on-the-walls
type?

157
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:20.982
They're not gonna talk back
to you. baby.

158
00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.942
That's not how they do this.
(chuckles)

159
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.319
Okay.

160
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.112
Y'all got to excuse
my unholy language back there.

161
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.489
-Yes. yes.
-I just...

162
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.908
-Yes. I would've got mad
at that. too. -Whoo.

163
00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.118
-(Lee-Curtis grunts)
-Even. uh. Jesus lost it

164
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.620
in the temple that day.

165
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.789
(laughs): It probably was gum
in the temple. too.

166
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.332
Okay. strength of the Lord.

167
00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.458
Won't he do it?

168
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.876
-All the time.
-Won't he do it?

169
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:40.877
All the time.

170
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.045
Oh. Okay.

171
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.381
Uh. over there is
our creative arts center.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.049
They ain't ready. Come on.

173
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.634
That's where our world-renowned
dance ministries rehearse.

174
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.512
We got hip-hop.
We got ribbon twirling.

175
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.805
-Miming.
-Right in there.

176
00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.183
Now. have y'all ever seen
praise miming?

177
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.644
'Cause we do it all the time
here. right. Trin?

178
00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.604
-(grunting rhythmically)
-(chuckling)

179
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.649
-(scatting)
-(laughing)

180
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.235
-Uh-oh. (laughs)
-Ooh. boy!

181
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.820
Uh. y'all l-look
at the railings?

182
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.154
LEE-CURTIS:
You know. we like to keep

183
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.948
a few options here
on the church's campus.

184
00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.950
-Never know when you're
gonna need something. -Yeah.

185
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.036
This one time. a White House
correspondent stopped by...

186
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.831
-Oh. -...and I had on
something fantastic.

187
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.332
-Yes. Yeah.
-It was a pinstripe.

188
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.042
-(clicks tongue) But...
-(chuckles)

189
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.670
...do pinstripes evoke
matters of state? No. no.

190
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.673
Luckily. we had all this here
to switch it up.

191
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.174
-Mm-hmm.
-And this is just as important

192
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.676
-as any White House visit.
-Yeah. yeah.

193
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.594
-All right?
-Ab-- Yeah. absolutely.

194
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.847
So. uh. what are you
thinking. hon?

195
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:37.475
What is calling you
for our first Sunday back?

196
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.768
None of these.

197
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.186
-Mm-mm. Nothing in here.
-No?

198
00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.731
See. our first Sunday back
is Easter Sunday.

199
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.524
-and that-- right?
-Yeah. yeah.

200
00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.693
That deserves
something special.

201
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.653
Something new.

202
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.030
-Uh. yeah.
-Yeah.

203
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.740
-You-you sure? Nothing in here?
-May I?

204
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.074
-I'm gonna tell you
what I'm thinking. -Oh. Okay.

205
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.326
I'm thinking Prada.

206
00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.703
-Right? (laughs)
-Mm.

207
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.371
TRINITIE: There is--
I'm t-- I'm telling you.

208
00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:01.374
there is just something about
a pastor in Prada.

209
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.834
It just-- it gives you chills.

210
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:06.713
Well. I have been blessed
with some beautiful Prada.

211
00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:07.881
(both grunt)

212
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.716
-(Trinitie laughs)
-What you think?

213
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.969
-Uh. purple Prada?
-Hmm. I like the color.

214
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.554
TRINITIE:
You know what?

215
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.056
We don't want to go
too extravagant.

216
00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:18.350
Yeah. we want people
to really see us.

217
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.060
look deep into our souls.

218
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.812
and I don't think you quite
get there with the purple.

219
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.941
This is nice. too.
Y'all can get...

220
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.402
-That's cute!
-Yeah. it's real cute.

221
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:31.821
-Oh. my goodness. I like it.
-I like it. I like it.

222
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.074
-I like that. too. I like it.
-I like that. Come on. now.

223
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.533
(laughs)

224
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.244
-Oh. you got the peach Prada.
-I got the peach Prada.

225
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.122
-The periwinkle Prada. (laughs)
-The periwinkle Prada.

226
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.792
-The pearl Prada.
-Pearl Prada. We got a--

227
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.086
Lord have mercy.
I got a pearl...

228
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.712
-(laughs)
-(mumbling playfully)

229
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.756
Look at him. Look at him!

230
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.675
-(laughs)
-(kisses loudly)

231
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.302
LEE-CURTIS: Some
people think it's excessive.

232
00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.640
My old deacon board.

233
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.145
They get so riled up about
some of these divine additions.

234
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.357
And it just got. uh...

235
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.775
unmanageable.

236
00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.527
I prayed on it. though.

237
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:14.197
And God eventually told me
to just be free.

238
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.117
See. the Lord revealed
unto Lee-Curtis that deacons.

239
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.910
well. they just-- they didn't
work for our ministry.

240
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.620
-Mm. you know what he told me?
-Hmm.

241
00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.080
He told me that I needed to be

242
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:25.208
rid of such an ungodly
governmental structure.

243
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.128
Yeah. yeah.
That-that was a quote. too.

244
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:33.341
Because what good are disciples
if they are undisciplined?

245
00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.641
It's not to worry. though.

246
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.476
It's. uh. just
a slight unpleasantness.

247
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.644
All a thing of the past.

248
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.146
And now look.

249
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.397
(both chuckle)

250
00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:50.358
Now we've been blessed
with an indoor fountain.

251
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.110
-Yeah. (laughs)
-Baby.

252
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.737
-Baby. go turn the fountain on
for me. -Oh. Yes.

253
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.696
Sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.990
(both laughing)

255
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.784
-Wait till you see it.
-Here we go. Here we go.

256
00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.162
(mouthing)

257
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.792
Mm.

258
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.838
Mm.

259
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.174
What you think? Come here.

260
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.967
(laughing)

261
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.512
Mm.

262
00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.014
-Give them the finger.
-Okay.

263
00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.432
-Bang.
-Oh. right here.

264
00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.434
-Smile. Smile.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

265
00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.728
* *

266
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.231
HOST: All right.
caller. you're on the air

267
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.776
with LT and Jamila
here on WRX 104.

268
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.235
And we're about to get into

269
00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.529
this whole Wander to
Greater Paths situation.

270
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.114
What are some of your thoughts?

271
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.908
WOMAN: I mean. I'm really
hoping they open back up.

272
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.284
Pastor Childs and his sermons

273
00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.244
were the reason
I got my shit together

274
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.580
and stopped running numbers and
dedicated my life to Christ.

275
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.415
Ooh. and if they looking
to put folks in the movie.

276
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.292
I just want to say
that I act and sing.

277
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.710
I do hair. I could do...

278
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.629
NEWSWOMAN:
Prominent megachurch pastor

279
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.547
Lee-Curtis Childs faces

280
00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.841
allegations of
sexual misconduct.

281
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.635
He maintains that
all the allegations

282
00:11:58.677 --> 00:11:59.969
against him are false.

283
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.805
Criminal charges are not

284
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.140
a part of the discussion. but
a settlement is on the table.

285
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.476
with many speculating
the payoffs have begun.

286
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:07.894
MAN:
Niggas keep shouting

287
00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.938
"victim this. victim that."

288
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.398
Ain't no motherfucking victims.

289
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.733
Y'all tell me.
The pastor break the law?

290
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.235
No? A'ight. then.

291
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.070
NEWSMAN:
As a result of the allegations.

292
00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.072
Trinitie Childs. the first lady
of the Baptist church.

293
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.199
has been mum
but has stuck by her husband.

294
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.451
WOMAN 2:
What I don't get is his wife.

295
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.036
How could she not know?

296
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.913
How could she stand
being with a man like that?

297
00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.915
-Ugh. Just makes my skin crawl.
-(reporters clamoring)

298
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.500
LEE-CURTIS: Please.
A little space. Thank you.

299
00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.127
REPORTER:
Do you have any comment?

300
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.336
No comment?

301
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.463
(thunder rumbling softly)

302
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.800
SHAKURA:
Although we're both pastors

303
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.760
at Heaven's House.

304
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.429
the Pastor
and First Lady Childs

305
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.140
have been a huge inspiration
for us.

306
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.767
as up-and-coming
church leaders. of course.

307
00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.771
(chuckles)
But also as-as a couple

308
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.065
covered under the Lord.

309
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.775
-KEON: It's just...
-Uh...

310
00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.736
It's so sticky.

311
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.988
-So sticky.
-This situation.

312
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.991
But we only pray for the best

313
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.118
-for everyone involved.
-Mm-hmm.

314
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.911
And prayer works. y'all.

315
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.831
When all this was
first going down.

316
00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:11.958
I prayed that
the first lady would

317
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.170
un-file those divorce papers
she served the pastor.

318
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.339
And look what the Lord did.

319
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.382
Kept those two beautiful souls
together.

320
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.802
That is a silver lining
if ever there was one.

321
00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.473
That and
our congregation growth.

322
00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.976
-Now. not that we wish
anyone's downfall... -No.

323
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:33.021
...but the fact that these
souls had another church home

324
00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.106
to go to
for the good Word of God.

325
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.068
-that is also a blessing.
-Amen.

326
00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.861
-'Cause we want to help heal
this community. -(chuckles)

327
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.654
-(laughs) Right?
-Yes.

328
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:45.075
And-and I just hope
that the Lord will see everyone

329
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:49.037
through this. uh. absolute
landfill of a circumstance.

330
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.420
-We could only hope...
-Mm.

331
00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:01.257
...to achieve
that sanctified success

332
00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.760
that Wander
to Greater Paths has.

333
00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.011
(chuckling)

334
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.138
One of these days. huh?

335
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.933
* One of these days. huh? *

336
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.352
* One of these days *

337
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:15.480
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days *

338
00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.190

339
00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.901
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days *

340
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.695
Hey. did-did y'all find.
um. parking okay?

341
00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.238
'Cause we had to add
a little. um.

342
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.282
overflow section
to the parking lot recently.

343
00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.325
You did?

344
00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.160
Okay. All right. Wonderful.
(laughs)

345
00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.955
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days. *

346
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.000
LEE-CURTIS:
Um...

347
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.210
let me tell you something
about the devil.

348
00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.880
He'll creep up on you

349
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:45.927
and just crawl his way into
your life and under your skin

350
00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.971
like a...

351
00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.475
...roach under the floorboards.

352
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.063
He'll hold on tight. too.

353
00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.565
TRINITIE:
Uh. look.

354
00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.858
(laughs) Look.

355
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.276
-We've prayed. Okay?
-We have.

356
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.987
We-we-we are past this stage
in our lives now.

357
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.905
Now we are here.

358
00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.449
-Right here.
-Yes.

359
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.993
And. uh. ready
to get back to just

360
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.578
-doing good Christian work.
-Mm.

361
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:15.582
Anyways. so we got
some good people outside

362
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.751
-waiting to come in
and meet y'all. -Yeah.

363
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:20.003
-They are...
-(sighs)

364
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.797
our real followers.

365
00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.674
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

366
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.301
They stuck by us.

367
00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.470
Even with all the awfulness

368
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.097
-that-that folks was conjuring.
-Yeah.

369
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.932
And they're gonna be
sanctified witnesses

370
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.643
to what you all
are about to see.

371
00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.104
DEACONESS:
Oh. we're here

372
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.481
because we want to be.

373
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.232
When I was coming up
through the church.

374
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.151
you didn't just up and leave
your place of worship

375
00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.736
because of any old thing.

376
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.071
-(laughs)
-Mm-mm.

377
00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.073
Besides. wasn't nothing
even confirmed.

378
00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.532
I bet this whole talk
of a settlement

379
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.826
is just to get the thing
good and over with.

380
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.620
I don't think
that you're posing

381
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.622
the right questions here.
my beautiful sister.

382
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:59.000
When will we.
as a Christian culture.

383
00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:02.003
realize that
we got it all wrong?

384
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:05.048
Pastor Childs is just
ahead of his time.

385
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.549
He's a visionary.

386
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.302
Well. little Aria here
only likes a few things.

387
00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:13.014
That's paintball guns.
real guns. church

388
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.809
and that TV show
where the little animals talk

389
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.477
in the high-pitched voices.

390
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.813
Once you weigh everything out.
church was the least taxing.

391
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.773
so we try to do it
as much as we can.

392
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:22.899
Don't we. little Aria?

393
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.859
Come back down here.

394
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.319
Now. let me tell you something.

395
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.238
The church I came up at
when I was a little girl.

396
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.240
the musical director
was found out

397
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.991
to be in one of
those sex groups.

398
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.744
You know. those. um. um...

399
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.996
-Orgies.
-Uh. yup. Mm-hmm.

400
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.165
And-and not just
the regular ones.

401
00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.960
Had him crawling round
on all fours.

402
00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.963
pretending he was
a horse and such.

403
00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.756
You know what the elders did?

404
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.174
They kept him.

405
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:51.094
His service had done
more for our church

406
00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:54.431
than just any old discretions
could soil.

407
00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:58.143
Pastor Childs' word
saves folks.

408
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.353
And you don't just go
replacing somebody

409
00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.480
with the spirit of the Lord
in him like that.

410
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:06.192
A lot of the former
WTGP members ran right on over

411
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.737
to Heaven's House
with Pastor and Pastor Sumpter.

412
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.239
-I just don't think...
-LEE-CURTIS: Excuse me?

413
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.369
The. uh. Sumpters. did you say?

414
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.837
He has so much love.

415
00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.798
It's just about written in the
Bible that he should spread it

416
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.426
as far and wide as he can.

417
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.512
Now. to whom it spreads to...

418
00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:40.185
...well. that's gonna require
our deepest prayers.

419
00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.104
But he'll get right.
I believe him.

420
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.482
You know what. let me just go

421
00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.275
-spruce myself up a bit.
-(laughs)

422
00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:50.195
then we can really get
this thing started off right.

423
00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.489
Y'all just give me one moment.

424
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.407
-Gonna get my good jacket.
-(laughs)

425
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.576
(Lee-Curtis clears throat)

426
00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.536
Oh. my goodness.

427
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.081
(chuckles)

428
00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.708
Um. Anita. can we--
can you cut for a sec?

429
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.295
I just want to clarify some
things before we... (sighs)

430
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:10.215
before we get started.
just make sure

431
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.093
that we're working towards
the same goal.

432
00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.929
Okay?
You know. it's. uh. well...

433
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.430
(sighs)

434
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.475
Lee-Curtis is working
so. so hard.

435
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.936
So hard.

436
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.938
And so am I. you know?

437
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.773
You-you...

438
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.654
You got to be strong
to be a first lady.

439
00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:36.241
Smart. Uh...

440
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.285
Diligent. Uh. uh...

441
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:43.915
It's-it's real mental
and psychological gymnastics.

442
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.459
And. um...

443
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.420
well...

444
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:52.799
The pastor may be
the-the head and face

445
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.884
of a congregation. but...

446
00:18:56.219 --> 00:19:00.015
...the neck and-and the spine.
the-the...

447
00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.307
(exhales sharply)

448
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.351
the structure?

449
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.025
That is all the first lady.

450
00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.485
And so...

451
00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:16.031
I just need to make sure
that we are structurally sound.

452
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.866
Okay. Anita?

453
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.578
I-I... I need to know that
we're on the same team.

454
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.831
-That we want to make
a great film because... -Hey.

455
00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.375
-Well. because that's what
we want to make. -Hey. hey.

456
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.128
-(laughing) -Hey. hey. hey.
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

457
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.255
Baby. Baby! Come on. now.

458
00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.257
I already told you that
these are good people.

459
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.759
Yes. Yes. Yes.

460
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.844
They only care about
what the world cares about.

461
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.847
And what the world cares about
is a man of God

462
00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.683
back and better than ever
as a new and improved preacher.

463
00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.852
-Ain't that right. y'all?
-Mm-hmm.

464
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:48.313
Uh. so like I said...
(clears throat)

465
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.648
we got some good people outside

466
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.150
waiting to come in
and meet y'all.

467
00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.444
-Oh. boy. (laughs)
-Mm-hmm.

468
00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.530
You there.

469
00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:00.200
Yeah. with
the big old microphone.

470
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.701
Come in closer. son.

471
00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.578
-No. no. that's...
-It's okay.

472
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.247
-Closer. Come on. son.
-I think that's good.

473
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.541
-Right there. -You gonna want
to hear all of this. All right?

474
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.126
-Yeah. -They gonna want
to hear all of this.

475
00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.211
Everybody can hear.

476
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.380
-All right. everyone.
-(sighs)

477
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.965
-I've gathered you here
today... -Mm.

478
00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.885
...to culminate
the first day of my rebirth

479
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.929
-the right way.
-(sighs)

480
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.014
I am new.

481
00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.557
Mm.

482
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.268
And I will submit my newness
right here in front of you

483
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.147
and in the eyes of the Lord.

484
00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.816
But first...

485
00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.401
(laughs)

486
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.987
...you gonna see
what all the fuss is about.

487
00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:40.949
(laughing)

488
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.576
-Showtime!
-Oh. Uh-oh.

489
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.703
Come here.

490
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.496
-No. no. no. (laughs)
-No. no. I just--

491
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.914
I'm just trying to see
if I can get a rise out of her.

492
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.582
-No. No.
-Hey. now!

493
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.627
Today's word.

494
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.631
Restraint
in the name of the Lord.

495
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.592
Now. who here can name
an instance from the Bible

496
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:03.304
where the lack of restraint
was punished?

497
00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.433
Little Aria. go ahead. baby.

498
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.436
Um. well. um.

499
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:14.441
in my last class. we. um.
learned about Adam and Eve.

500
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:19.738
And they were bad because
they didn't listen to God.

501
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.323
-(Lee-Curtis claps)
-That's right. sweetheart.

502
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.284
Look at you making your way

503
00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.119
-in a grown-up service.
-(congregants chuckling)

504
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.663
This little baby
is right on it.

505
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.458
Mm. Did Eve show restraint.
little Aria?

506
00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.625
No. Pastor Childs.

507
00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.502
Did she ignore God's graces

508
00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.797
and allow herself to be swayed
by temptation?

509
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:40.133
-Yes. sir. Pastor Childs.
Yes. sir. -Ooh.

510
00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.177
Women!

511
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.137
The "wo-man."

512
00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:46.222
The birther
of the original sin.

513
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:49.601
But you have the blessing
of restraint deep within you.

514
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.311
-Can I get an amen?
-CONGREGANTS: Amen!

515
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:54.606
-(organ chords playing) -But
you're gonna need to suit up.

516
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.318
because the journey
to holy restraint is a battle.

517
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.028
-Right.
-And to win that battle.

518
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.821
-you gonna need every tool
that you can think of. -Praise!

519
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.490
-(scattered shouting)
-You gonna need

520
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:06.618
the sword of the Spirit
to cut through evil!

521
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.454
You gonna need the shield
of faith to keep the devil

522
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.164
from penetrating your soul!

523
00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:16.252
But you got to bring yourself

524
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:17.712

525
00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:18.922
Yes.

526
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.466
Are you ready

533
00:22:33.478 --> 00:22:34.938
(organ playing flourishes)

534
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:37.524
-Praise you. Jesus.
-(Sapphire whoops)

535
00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:41.403

536
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.405
-DEACON: Oh. yes. yes!
-KENSINGTON: Yes. God.

537
00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:46.074
* I know he's all right *

538
00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:48.368
-DEACON: Thank you. Lord Jesus.
-SAPPHIRE: Praise him. baby.

539
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.411
LEE-CURTIS:
Yes. praise him.

540
00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:50.578
(speaking in tongues)

541
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.205
Lord. God Almighty.

542
00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:53.873
Yes. Lord! Yes. God!

543
00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:56.918
(congregants
speaking in tongues)

544
00:23:00.964 --> 00:23:02.507
LEE-CURTIS:
Come on!

545
00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:04.884
I love the theater.

546
00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:06.886
(congregants continue
speaking in tongues)

547
00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:09.222
Yes. Lord God.

548
00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:11.433
-(organ playing gentle music)
-Mm.

549
00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.978
I feel you in me.

550
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.065
I feel you deep within me.

551
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:21.401
Hallelujah.

552
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.611
You know what you were
pushing me to be.

553
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:28.074
To be the best possible version
of myself that I can be.

554
00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:36.624
You're pushing me
to be brand-new.

555
00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.006
(exhales slowly)

556
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:49.137
To be brand-new!

557
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.101
I have been
crucified with Christ.

558
00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.354
and I no longer live.

559
00:23:57.395 --> 00:24:00.690
But Christ lives in me.

560
00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:03.443
The life I now live
in the body. I live by faith

561
00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:04.944
-in the Son of God...
-Whoo.

562
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:06.571
It's chilly.

563
00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:09.532
...who loved me
and gave himself for me.

564
00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:11.659
TRINITIE:
Lord. we come to you

565
00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:13.828
on this glorious day.

566
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.958
Allow us to stay strong
and know that when man falters.

567
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.212
-God stays steady and sure.
-Yes. Yes. God.

568
00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:26.007
Buried with him
in the likeness of his death.

569
00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:29.219
Raised with him in the likeness
of his resurrection

570
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.263
to walk in the newness of life.

571
00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:34.516
(Lee-Curtis inhales deeply)

572
00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.564
TRINITIE (quietly):
Yes. Lord.

573
00:24:41.606 --> 00:24:43.566
Yes. Jesus.

574
00:24:48.113 --> 00:24:51.074
Oh. God. Yes. Yes. God.

576
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.539
-KENSINGTON: Hallelujah!
-DEACON: Praise!

577
00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.374

Hear us. Lord. Thank you. Lord.

582
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:12.554
In Jesus's name we pray.

583
00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:14.973
-"Ay-men!"
-"Ah-men!"

584
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:18.601
-Now. I thought we said...
-No.

585
00:25:18.643 --> 00:25:21.312
No. no. no. No. Uh...

We agreed. remember?

587
00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:25.442
-We agreed that "ah-men"

588
00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:28.361
No. but I just think we got to
keep up with the times. Right?

589
00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:30.905
And all the people that's hot

In Jesus's name we pray.

692
00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:52.917
Can you just. can you just
do the other thing?

693
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.172
Please. baby.

694
00:29:57.213 --> 00:30:00.425
I-I really need you
to help me out here.

695
00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:02.677
Yeah. baby.

696
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:04.137
Of course.

697
00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:06.431
(Lee-Curtis panting heavily)

698
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:15.357
* *

699
00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:20.153
(breath trembles)

700
00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:21.863
(moans)

701
00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:25.950
(moaning)

702
00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.912
(muffled moaning)

703
00:30:28.953 --> 00:30:31.206
(moaning loudly)

704
00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:37.587
(panting)

705
00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:39.881
Thank you. God.

706
00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:51.059
Y'all want to know

707
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.520
where God has really blessed me?

708
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:57.941
Where I'm the richest
and the most prosperous?

709
00:30:58.733 --> 00:31:00.276
Not that I'm not
eternally grateful

710
00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:03.780
for the jets and the cars
and the designer suits.

711
00:31:03.822 --> 00:31:05.156
(congregation laughing)

712
00:31:05.198 --> 00:31:09.035
But where God has really
showed out his blessings

713
00:31:09.077 --> 00:31:10.912
-is in my marriage...
-MAN: Uh-huh.

714
00:31:10.954 --> 00:31:12.080
(applause)

715
00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:14.541
...to my wonderful wife.

716
00:31:16.584 --> 00:31:18.795
Now. I... (clears throat)

717
00:31:18.837 --> 00:31:21.089
I have to be honest.

718
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:24.384
Marriage is hard.

719
00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:27.220
It's work.

720
00:31:27.262 --> 00:31:30.140
It is the only thing in my life
that I've been blessed with

721
00:31:30.181 --> 00:31:34.477
that requires true energy
to sustain.

722
00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:37.814
But it is. without a shadow
of a doubt. a blessing.

723
00:31:37.856 --> 00:31:39.232
CONGREGATION:
Yes!

724
00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:41.568
Man is made for woman.
woman is made for man.

725
00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:43.278
and it is a beautiful thing.

726
00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:44.821
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

727
00:31:44.863 --> 00:31:48.616
And it is written
and it's the Word of God.

728
00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:52.287
Now. what is not beautiful

729
00:31:52.328 --> 00:31:54.622
and what is not
made out of God's love

730
00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:57.792
is the homosexual agenda.

731
00:31:57.834 --> 00:31:59.669
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

732
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:01.421
It disregards.

733
00:32:01.463 --> 00:32:05.383
it disrespects.
and it devalues the marriage

734
00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:09.137
-I work so hard for every day.
-(applause)

735
00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:12.182
And not just mine.

736
00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:14.851
-Yours.
-(murmuring. applause)

737
00:32:14.893 --> 00:32:16.269
And yours.

738
00:32:16.311 --> 00:32:20.273
And yours. And yours.

739
00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:21.274
And yours.

740
00:32:21.316 --> 00:32:23.693
MAN:
Speak on it. Pastor!

741
00:32:24.903 --> 00:32:28.114
It is man and woman

742
00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:30.325
and marriage.

743
00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:33.286
That is the only way
to prosperity.

744
00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:37.082
And that is the only way
into the kingdom of God.

745
00:32:37.123 --> 00:32:38.375
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

746
00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:39.959
Take it from me.

747
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:42.629
I am the prophet
with the beautiful wife

748
00:32:42.671 --> 00:32:44.089
and the gorgeous Bugatti.

749
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.341
-(Trinitie laughs)
-(laughter. applause)

750
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:50.345
(applause swelling)

751
00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:57.894
-(indistinct chatter)
-(music playing quietly)

752
00:32:57.936 --> 00:33:00.397
(cell phone ringing)

753
00:33:02.857 --> 00:33:04.401
(clears throat)

754
00:33:04.442 --> 00:33:06.569
YVET:
So you just got to get it close

755
00:33:06.611 --> 00:33:09.155
to the scalp.
like as tight as possible.

756
00:33:09.197 --> 00:33:12.909
And then this beauty here
goes on like so.

757
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:14.369
And voilà. (chuckles)

758
00:33:14.411 --> 00:33:16.246
This the style
the church ladies like to get.

759
00:33:16.287 --> 00:33:17.997
It's got to be slick

760
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.291
and laid to fit
all the adornments on top.

761
00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.794
Because if there's one thing
those church ladies love.

762
00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:24.295
it's a good hat.

763
00:33:24.337 --> 00:33:27.298
(over speakers):
* We're gonna be all right... *

764
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.592
(gospel music
continues quietly)

765
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:33.013
(Trinitie sighs)

766
00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:34.597
Sanctuary!

767
00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:36.725
In the church.
we have this saying:

768
00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:38.601
"Come as you are."

769
00:33:38.643 --> 00:33:41.354
But. you know. that-that's
mostly sentiment. of course.

770
00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:44.065
Sure. you could just.
I guess. roll out of bed

771
00:33:44.107 --> 00:33:46.026
(chuckles):
and come praise the Lord

772
00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:49.237
in your T-shirt and flip-flops.
I guess.

773
00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:51.239
But we also have another saying:

774
00:33:51.281 --> 00:33:53.575
"God don't like ugly."

775
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.577
(chuckling)

776
00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:57.537
Whoo!

777
00:33:57.579 --> 00:33:59.706
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

778
00:33:59.748 --> 00:34:01.082
Do you see this. Anita?

779
00:34:01.124 --> 00:34:04.169
It's like a work of art.
Don't you think?

780
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.879
Oh. my God. What is...

781
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.464
Ooh.

782
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:09.716
What is this?

783
00:34:09.758 --> 00:34:10.884
Mm.

784
00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:12.260
Come here. Anita.

785
00:34:12.302 --> 00:34:14.054
Go ahead. Touch this.

786
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:17.807
This is crystal beading
and spider silk.

787
00:34:17.849 --> 00:34:19.142
(sighs)

788
00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:22.062
A combination like this is...

789
00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:25.774
it is holy and sexy all at once.

790
00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:27.359
Imagine.

791
00:34:29.444 --> 00:34:31.613
Wait a minute. (sighs)

792
00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.370
Isn't it the most remarkable
thing you've ever seen?

793
00:34:39.371 --> 00:34:41.331
VERA:
The first lady comes in here

794
00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:43.750
a lot these days. Mm-hmm.

795
00:34:43.792 --> 00:34:46.044
It's a rough spot to be in.

796
00:34:46.086 --> 00:34:49.005
But. whoo. these men--

797
00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:50.548
they'll do it to you.
won't they?

798
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.676
Chew you up. spit you out.
and then curse you

799
00:34:52.717 --> 00:34:55.095
for not giving them
enough nutrients.

800
00:34:55.136 --> 00:34:56.721
(sighs)

801
00:34:56.763 --> 00:35:00.600
That woman deserves
every hat in the store.

802
00:35:00.642 --> 00:35:02.686
(indistinct chatter)

803
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.902
* *

804
00:35:19.744 --> 00:35:21.663
Uh... (exhales)

805
00:35:21.705 --> 00:35:23.331
(clears throat)

806
00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:26.459
Would you just. uh...
would you excuse me?

807
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:27.794
Thank you.

808
00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:31.297
Uh. no. no. no.
Uh. I-I think we're good here.

809
00:35:31.339 --> 00:35:34.175
Okay. we've-we've got...
we've got enough.

810
00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:38.805
Anita... (laughs)

811
00:35:38.847 --> 00:35:41.016
I said we are done.

812
00:35:41.057 --> 00:35:42.475
All right?

813
00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:45.854
God bless. Thank you.

814
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:49.733
* *

815
00:35:49.774 --> 00:35:51.568
HOST:
Word on the street is that

816
00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.361
this Wander to Greater Paths
lawsuit is closing in.

817
00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:55.196
And it's got the streets shook.

818
00:35:55.238 --> 00:35:56.531
What's going on. caller?

819
00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:57.991
MAN:
Yeah. they were young.

820
00:35:58.033 --> 00:35:59.492
but they were adults.

821
00:35:59.534 --> 00:36:01.661
Uh. they agreed to doing
all that shit. Right?

822
00:36:01.703 --> 00:36:03.329
WOMAN:
These niggas was what.

823
00:36:03.371 --> 00:36:05.165
like 18. 19. 20?
That's grown as hell.

824
00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:06.791
This ain't even like that mess

825
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:08.835
with the priests and stuff
you be hearing about.

826
00:36:08.877 --> 00:36:11.463
Those be actual. factual kids.
you know what I'm saying?

827
00:36:11.504 --> 00:36:13.256
MAN 2:
I don't believe the pastor did

828
00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:14.841
none of that such shit
with them niggas.

829
00:36:14.883 --> 00:36:16.843
Every time a Black man
get some power.

830
00:36:16.885 --> 00:36:19.012
here come folks
trying to tear him down.

831
00:36:19.054 --> 00:36:21.181
It's a damn shame.

832
00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:22.724
WOMAN 2:
Mm. The way I see it.

833
00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:24.309
the first lady is doing
what she needs to do.

834
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:26.269
That's grown woman stuff
right there.

835
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:28.855
That lady right there is strong.

836
00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:32.525
(no audio)

837
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:48.708
(sighs)

838
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.293
Y'all waited for me?

839
00:36:50.335 --> 00:36:53.004
I thought I said
you could just...

840
00:36:53.046 --> 00:36:54.506
You know what? It's fine.

841
00:36:54.547 --> 00:36:56.216
I just had to finish
some last-minute shopping--

842
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:58.677
girl stuff-- and I just did not
think that you all would even

843
00:36:58.718 --> 00:37:01.137
-be interested. so I...
-First Lady?

844
00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:03.098
First Lady.

845
00:37:03.139 --> 00:37:05.392
Sister Denetta.

846
00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:06.893
(both chuckle)

847
00:37:06.935 --> 00:37:08.019
How are you?

848
00:37:08.061 --> 00:37:09.896
Oh. look at you.

849
00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:11.106
Look at you.

850
00:37:11.147 --> 00:37:12.065
(both chuckle)

851
00:37:12.107 --> 00:37:13.775
Oh. bless your heart.

852
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:18.071
Look at you. (chuckles)

853
00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:19.989
And bless. also. your own heart.

854
00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:22.450
And they are?

855
00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:25.578
Oh. well. we're just

856
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.081
documenting this time
in our lives.

857
00:37:28.123 --> 00:37:29.666
Me and Lee-Curtis. obviously.

858
00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:32.085
with. uh. you know.
building our church back up

859
00:37:32.127 --> 00:37:36.256
and working towards our
first service back this Easter.

860
00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:39.217
-Easter. you say?
-Mm-hmm.

861
00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:41.720
That's so crazy. (laughs)

862
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:44.097
You know that's when
the Sumpters are opening up

863
00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:47.308
their new Heaven's House
location. right?

864
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.310
-The Sumpters?
-Mm-hmm.

865
00:37:49.352 --> 00:37:51.104
-Really?
-Mm.

866
00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:53.982
-This Easter?
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

867
00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:57.110
Of course.
this might make things

868
00:37:57.152 --> 00:37:59.779
a little more complicated
for y'all.

869
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:01.614
(Denetta laughs)

870
00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:02.782
(laughs)

871
00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:05.368
Well. anyway.
you just keep on praying.

872
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.705
And I'm sure
plenty of the old congregation

873
00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:10.290
will come right on back through

874
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:12.125
good old
Wander to Greater Paths' doors.

875
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:13.376
Well. that is for sure.

876
00:38:13.418 --> 00:38:16.338
I know they will. Yes.

877
00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:19.716
But you won't. though.

878
00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:22.469
Right? You and your family?

879
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.637
Word is that y'all done...

880
00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:29.059
y'all done went and got
yourselves a new church home.

881
00:38:33.855 --> 00:38:35.482
(Denetta chuckles)

882
00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:39.986
Oh. well. sweetie. I had to.

883
00:38:40.028 --> 00:38:44.741
You know I do career counseling
at the community college.

884
00:38:44.783 --> 00:38:47.994
-Mm.
-It just wouldn't look right.

885
00:38:48.036 --> 00:38:51.039
You understand.

886
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:53.875
-Hmm? (chuckles)
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

887
00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:55.126
No. I understand.

888
00:38:55.168 --> 00:38:57.420
Of course I understand.

889
00:38:57.462 --> 00:38:58.713
But prayers up for y'all.

890
00:38:58.755 --> 00:39:00.173
-(playfully): Prayers up.
-(both laugh)

891
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:02.384
-You so hood.
-I keep it real.

892
00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:05.512
No. look. Ghetto thing.

893
00:39:05.553 --> 00:39:08.765
(both laughing)

894
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.813
(both sighing)

895
00:39:17.732 --> 00:39:19.359
Well. I got to get going.

896
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:21.486
-You have a blessed one.
-Oh. my goodness.

897
00:39:21.528 --> 00:39:23.947
-And you have a blessed...
-Okay.

898
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.711
Look. you don't get to pick
how the devil torments you.

899
00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:39.963
You see what I'm saying?

900
00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:44.551
Now. I volunteered
for this. right?

901
00:39:44.592 --> 00:39:47.971
I chose for y'all
to come down here to truly see

902
00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:51.057
and to show the world
what I'm really about.

903
00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:55.020
And I promise to God.
this is who I am.

904
00:39:56.104 --> 00:39:57.480
You know?

905
00:40:02.444 --> 00:40:04.863
I did not hurt anybody.

906
00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.072
No. no. no. no.

907
00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:10.577
Hurt? Nobody was hurt
with me or by me.

908
00:40:10.618 --> 00:40:14.414
If anything.
I was too warm. okay?

909
00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:16.708
Was too generous.

910
00:40:20.045 --> 00:40:22.630
You know. part of this whole
thing that I remain proud of--

911
00:40:22.672 --> 00:40:24.591
and I will not budge on this--

912
00:40:24.632 --> 00:40:26.843
is that I did mentor
those individuals

913
00:40:26.885 --> 00:40:30.513
who are all now
so. uh. bothered.

914
00:40:30.555 --> 00:40:35.393
I was a light and
a guiding force in their lives.

915
00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:37.771
That's all that was.

916
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:40.523
It was me being a giver.

917
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:42.025
I'm a sinner.

918
00:40:42.067 --> 00:40:44.986
Okay?
Like any other human being.

919
00:40:45.028 --> 00:40:47.113
But. uh... (laughing)

920
00:40:49.407 --> 00:40:53.453
I'm no. uh... pervert.

921
00:40:53.495 --> 00:40:54.954
(chuckles)

922
00:40:54.996 --> 00:40:57.874
I'm no criminal.

923
00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:59.125
A sinner. yes.

924
00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:02.128
But all that other
horrible. awful stuff? No.

925
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.547
You can check the facts on that.

926
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:07.300
I am not a criminal.

927
00:41:07.342 --> 00:41:09.094
That's not me.

928
00:41:11.221 --> 00:41:13.515
(phone ringing)

929
00:41:13.556 --> 00:41:14.974
I. uh... (clears throat)

930
00:41:15.016 --> 00:41:16.851
Just one moment.

931
00:41:17.727 --> 00:41:19.020
This is Lee-Curtis Childs.

932
00:41:19.062 --> 00:41:21.856
pastor of Wander
to Greater Paths Baptist.

933
00:41:23.191 --> 00:41:25.527
Sh... Uh. yeah.

934
00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:27.862
Gary. yeah. we can.
we can discuss it now.

935
00:41:27.904 --> 00:41:29.614
Anita. I'm gonna need y'all
to give me

936
00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:31.366
a little bit of privacy
here for a sec.

937
00:41:31.408 --> 00:41:33.410
(grunts softly)

938
00:41:33.451 --> 00:41:35.704
Just one sec. Gary.

939
00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:40.041
(sighs) Lee-Curtis. we need
to chat about something.

940
00:41:40.083 --> 00:41:42.752
Uh. Anita. can you.
can you guys give us the room?

941
00:41:42.794 --> 00:41:45.171
-Uh. they're already
on their way out. -Good.

942
00:41:45.213 --> 00:41:48.174
-Uh. and I got Gary on the
line. so... -Oh. good. good.

943
00:41:48.216 --> 00:41:50.760
Um. can you hold on
one sec there. Gary.

944
00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:52.846
(quietly):
What is that?

945
00:41:52.887 --> 00:41:54.514
That. What is. what is that?

946
00:41:54.556 --> 00:41:57.017
Oh. you've never seen
a church hat before?

947
00:41:57.058 --> 00:41:58.935
-(sighs) Yeah.
-No. I just picked it up.

948
00:41:58.977 --> 00:42:01.521
I thought it might be nice
for our first Sunday.

949
00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:04.482
For somebody's
great-aunt Thomasina maybe.

950
00:42:04.524 --> 00:42:05.692
I mean. come on. baby.

951
00:42:05.734 --> 00:42:08.611
That is so not our style.
you know?

952
00:42:08.653 --> 00:42:13.199
You gonna make us both
look... ol-old.

953
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:20.165
-(sighs)
-Right?

954
00:42:20.206 --> 00:42:22.792
(both laugh)

955
00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:26.546
Hey. there's my beautiful girl.

956
00:42:26.588 --> 00:42:28.048
Uh. hey. Gary. I got. uh.

957
00:42:28.089 --> 00:42:30.050
Trinitie here. too. now
if that's better.

958
00:42:30.091 --> 00:42:32.552
So. uh. so. um-- Did you need
to say something to me?

959
00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:34.554
Uh. uh. uh...

960
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:38.641
N-Not-not important right now.
Hmm.

961
00:42:38.683 --> 00:42:40.560
All right.

962
00:42:40.602 --> 00:42:42.228
Uh. so. uh. Anita.

963
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.732
I'm gonna need y'all
to skedaddle now. okay?

964
00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:47.567
Thank you. (clears throat)

965
00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:49.778
One second.

966
00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:55.658
TRINITIE:
Uh-huh.

967
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.243
Yeah. Gary. we're both on.

968
00:42:57.285 --> 00:42:59.454
-Mm-hmm. -They don't know
how to act around it.

969
00:42:59.496 --> 00:43:00.538
-you know what I'm saying?
-Mm.

970
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.706
TRINITIE:
Oh. well.

971
00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:03.416
that's promising.

972
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:07.921
And-and what all do we owe.
to tie everything up nice and...

973
00:43:07.962 --> 00:43:10.715
-Can you zoom? Can you...
-It says. "Stay humble."

974
00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:12.092
LEE-CURTIS:
Now. wait just a minute.

975
00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:15.679
We've already shelled out...
(sighs)

976
00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:17.889
This is strong-arm robbery.

977
00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:20.058
I don't want
to shell out another...

978
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:23.561
Jesus fucking Christ!

979
00:43:23.603 --> 00:43:25.271
TRINITIE:
Uh. let-let's not use

980
00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:26.606
that language. Gary.

981
00:43:26.648 --> 00:43:28.942
Not here. Okay?
These were not boys.

982
00:43:28.983 --> 00:43:33.196
These were a group of adults
that made consenting decisions.

983
00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:35.949
And you make sure that
that is in the paperwork. too.

984
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.283
Okay?

985
00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:39.536
LEE-CURTIS (on TV):
These folks are overcome

986
00:43:39.577 --> 00:43:41.329
by demonic spirits.

987
00:43:41.371 --> 00:43:44.040
And they're trying to make
their ways into your lives.

988
00:43:44.082 --> 00:43:48.169
-one evil step at a time.
-(applause)

989
00:43:50.213 --> 00:43:52.799
Hold on. now.
You've only mentioned four.

990
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:56.344
So. wait. who's the.
who's-who's the holdout?

991
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.097
Just Khalil?

992
00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:03.476
Well. if he won't take it.
then he won't take it.

993
00:44:03.518 --> 00:44:05.145
TRINITIE:
(sighs) All right. Gary.

994
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:06.813
Let's just do it.

995
00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:09.983
Yes. yes. whatever
the amount is. we'll handle it.

996
00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:13.862
We just can't have this burden
on us anymore. on our church.

997
00:44:13.903 --> 00:44:18.950
For the love of God. let's
just do what we have to do.

998
00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:24.497
* 'Kay. I just called a play.
I just called a play... *

999
00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:26.124
VERLENZO:
Oh. hell yeah.

1000
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.793
Ball is everything. man.
Everything.

1001
00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:30.962
Since I learned
how to walk. on God.

1002
00:44:31.004 --> 00:44:33.089
And. you know.
being from around here.

1003
00:44:33.131 --> 00:44:36.259
man. all the leagues
started off in the churches.

1004
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:39.346
Man. I shot my first three
on Wander to Greater Paths.

1005
00:44:39.387 --> 00:44:41.264
The courts are beautiful. man.

1006
00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:42.766
(scoffs)

1007
00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:44.559
I used to hit 'em up
just to shoot around and stuff

1008
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:47.187
on the weekends
when I went home.

1009
00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:51.941
Now... now I got
to find somewhere else to go.

1010
00:44:51.983 --> 00:44:55.028
LEE-CURTIS:
So you enjoying your time here?

1011
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.696
I mean. working with Anita
and the film

1012
00:44:56.738 --> 00:44:58.031
and doing the whole sound thing?

1013
00:44:58.073 --> 00:44:59.532
BASIL:
Yeah. it's solid.

1014
00:44:59.574 --> 00:45:02.118
You get to go to new places.
meet interesting people.

1015
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.579
LEE-CURTIS: Interesting people.
Yeah. I bet.

1016
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:07.457
BASIL: Okay. all off. Whew.
That was a lot of tape.

1017
00:45:07.499 --> 00:45:09.668
LEE-CURTIS: Oh. boy.
Thanks for meeting me in here.

1018
00:45:09.709 --> 00:45:12.253
I get a little shy doing this
in front of the whole crew.

1019
00:45:12.295 --> 00:45:14.297
BASIL:
Ah. it's all good. All good.

1020
00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:18.718
LEE-CURTIS: Oh. uh. by the way.
I know I got a bit sensitive

1021
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.554
the other day when
I kicked y'all out of there.

1022
00:45:21.596 --> 00:45:23.056
Um...

1023
00:45:23.098 --> 00:45:24.641
And I know
it's all about to come out

1024
00:45:24.683 --> 00:45:25.934
and Trin is gonna
want to kill me

1025
00:45:25.975 --> 00:45:29.062
for telling too soon. but. uh...

1026
00:45:29.104 --> 00:45:30.689
it's over.

1027
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.732
I'm good.

1028
00:45:32.774 --> 00:45:34.067
BASIL:
I'm sorry. I don't. I don't...

1029
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:36.444
LEE-CURTIS:
Well. we. uh...

1030
00:45:36.486 --> 00:45:38.405
we-we've settled.

1031
00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:40.907
That's what that whole
phone call was about.

1032
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:44.536
Uh. all parties
came to an agreement.

1033
00:45:44.577 --> 00:45:47.455
and. uh. that's it.

1034
00:45:47.497 --> 00:45:48.915
You know?

1035
00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:51.501
Put all that. uh.
rah-rah stuff to bed.

1036
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:54.212
and. well. that's all she wrote.

1037
00:45:54.254 --> 00:45:55.755
I'm free.

1038
00:45:55.797 --> 00:45:58.091
The war is won.

1039
00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:01.094
BASIL:
Wow. That's...

1040
00:46:01.136 --> 00:46:03.430
that's g...
that's good for you.

1041
00:46:03.471 --> 00:46:05.932
LEE-CURTIS:
Yeah. Thank you.

1042
00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:09.477
Wait. hold-hold on for a second.

1043
00:46:09.519 --> 00:46:12.022
(groans)

1044
00:46:12.063 --> 00:46:14.315
(exhaling rhythmically)

1045
00:46:15.817 --> 00:46:17.360
(sighs)

1046
00:46:20.905 --> 00:46:23.158
(grunting playfully)

1047
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:27.120
How much you want to put
on this first shot?

1048
00:46:27.162 --> 00:46:29.122
-Hmm?
-(chuckles)

1049
00:46:30.749 --> 00:46:33.168
Oh!

1050
00:46:33.209 --> 00:46:34.461
Man.

1051
00:46:34.502 --> 00:46:36.338
(basketball bouncing)

1052
00:46:36.379 --> 00:46:38.423
All right.

1053
00:46:38.465 --> 00:46:39.966
-Whoo!
-Oh.

1054
00:46:40.008 --> 00:46:41.634
-Oh. nah. nah.
-(laughing)

1055
00:46:41.676 --> 00:46:43.303
Nah. I'm no good. I'm no good.

1056
00:46:43.345 --> 00:46:44.596
-(chuckles)
-All right. All right.

1057
00:46:44.637 --> 00:46:46.848
Well. rebound me. then.

1058
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.808
(sighs)

1059
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.477
-(net swooshes)
-There we go.

1060
00:46:50.518 --> 00:46:52.812
Cool job you got. man.

1061
00:46:52.854 --> 00:46:54.647
Working on a movie like this.

1062
00:46:54.689 --> 00:46:56.858
It's gonna be big. you know?

1063
00:46:57.692 --> 00:46:59.527
-(rim clanks)
-Uh...

1064
00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:01.071
Should be cool. Yeah.

1065
00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:04.115
Yeah. You're a lucky young man.

1066
00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:07.035
It's a phenomenal opportunity.

1067
00:47:07.077 --> 00:47:09.412
How old you got to be
to get a gig like this?

1068
00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:12.165
At least 19. 20 years old.
I'm thinking.

1069
00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:13.833
-I mean. yeah. probably.
-Yeah.

1070
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.627
I'm 26.

1071
00:47:15.669 --> 00:47:17.921
Really. now?

1072
00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:20.382
Huh. (grunts)

1073
00:47:20.423 --> 00:47:22.967
Hey. you know what I do
to stay looking fresh?

1074
00:47:23.009 --> 00:47:25.261
Strict shaving regimen.

1075
00:47:25.303 --> 00:47:27.347
-Yes. sir.
-(net swooshes)

1076
00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:29.974
I take off five years
when I trim up these whiskers.

1077
00:47:30.016 --> 00:47:32.894
Eight if my moisturizing
routine is tip-top.

1078
00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:34.979
Put you on game. son.

1079
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:36.731
That's important
in your industry. isn't it?

1080
00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:39.067
-The air of youth.
-(net swooshes)

1081
00:47:39.943 --> 00:47:42.570
Uh. not really
on my side of things.

1082
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:46.741
Yeah.

1083
00:47:46.783 --> 00:47:49.202
I could definitely put you on.

1084
00:47:49.244 --> 00:47:52.205
Hey. say.
when this movie is done

1085
00:47:52.247 --> 00:47:53.873
and the church is
back and booming.

1086
00:47:53.915 --> 00:47:58.044
you should come and do sound
for our audiovisual department.

1087
00:47:58.086 --> 00:48:00.046
That'd be real nice.
wouldn't it?

1088
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:01.631
And then after that.

1089
00:48:01.673 --> 00:48:04.092
well. I-I know a lot of folks
in the industry.

1090
00:48:04.134 --> 00:48:06.553
I can make some calls.
Just for you. though.

1091
00:48:06.594 --> 00:48:09.889
I don't ordinarily do
that sort of thing.

1092
00:48:09.931 --> 00:48:11.558
Oh. that should...

1093
00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:14.936
that. you know.
that could be... cool.

1094
00:48:14.978 --> 00:48:18.398
Cool? Cool. Cool. (chuckles)

1095
00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:22.777
Mm.

1096
00:48:22.819 --> 00:48:25.030
So much scruff.

1097
00:48:27.282 --> 00:48:29.617
My boyfriend digs it. so...

1098
00:48:34.622 --> 00:48:36.458
Well. we can't convert them all.

1099
00:48:36.499 --> 00:48:37.917
Ain't that right?

1100
00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:39.502
(chuckles)

1101
00:48:43.798 --> 00:48:46.092
Just getting off the mics.

1102
00:48:47.177 --> 00:48:49.554
I'm-I'm just--
I'm-a. I'm-a pack up my kit.

1103
00:48:49.596 --> 00:48:51.139
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1104
00:48:53.308 --> 00:48:55.769
It's good talking to you.
young man.

1105
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.189
You let me know if I can do
anything for you. okay?

1106
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.503
-(breathes deeply)
-Hey.

1107
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.931
Did you give him anything?

1108
00:49:32.972 --> 00:49:34.891
What?

1109
00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:36.518
No. I just offered
to help him with...

1110
00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:39.020
We just got robbed for
an obscene amount of money.

1111
00:49:39.062 --> 00:49:40.355
all for this to go away.

1112
00:49:40.397 --> 00:49:42.649
so we can't afford
for you to go back

1113
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:46.069
to being your generous self
with people.

1114
00:49:46.111 --> 00:49:48.655
My God. we need peace.

1115
00:49:48.697 --> 00:49:52.992
so you can get back
in that pulpit and preaching...

1116
00:49:53.034 --> 00:49:56.037
and get me back on that stage.

1117
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.250
(Trinitie sighs)

1118
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.505
Heaven's House is
opening its doors Easter.

1119
00:50:05.547 --> 00:50:07.590
Same as us.

1120
00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:09.300
What?

1121
00:50:10.093 --> 00:50:12.512
How do-- uh. who says?

1122
00:50:12.554 --> 00:50:14.180
Uh...

1123
00:50:14.222 --> 00:50:16.933
Is this what you were trying
to tell me before

1124
00:50:16.975 --> 00:50:19.227
at the office when...?

1125
00:50:20.812 --> 00:50:23.023
Because surely you wouldn't
have kept something

1126
00:50:23.064 --> 00:50:24.399
like this from me.

1127
00:50:26.443 --> 00:50:27.694
Yeah?

1128
00:50:32.907 --> 00:50:35.702
Yeah. (chuckles softly)

1129
00:50:35.744 --> 00:50:37.746
I just found out myself today

1130
00:50:37.787 --> 00:50:39.622
when I. when I... (sighs)

1131
00:50:39.664 --> 00:50:42.459
I booked my hair appointment
with Yvet.

1132
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.044
-You know. that Yvet...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1133
00:50:44.085 --> 00:50:45.128
I mean. sh-she knows
everyone's business.

1134
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.713
-and that's how I...
-Yeah.

1135
00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:51.259
Fuck!

1136
00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:54.804
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1137
00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:59.601
(yells furiously)

1138
00:51:10.028 --> 00:51:12.447
-Got it all out?
-Yup.

1139
00:51:14.532 --> 00:51:16.743
Okay.

1140
00:51:16.785 --> 00:51:18.870
Well. good.

1141
00:51:20.288 --> 00:51:21.873
Let's go for a ride.

1142
00:51:21.915 --> 00:51:24.167
(music playing quietly)

1143
00:51:29.547 --> 00:51:33.093
KEON: Okay. Mr. and Mrs.
Sullivan. you can come on in.

1144
00:51:33.134 --> 00:51:36.388
Oh. uh. Pastor Childs.
First Lady.

1145
00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:38.056
We were hoping
you might have a moment.

1146
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:39.391
Well. I'm afraid we have

1147
00:51:39.432 --> 00:51:42.227
a slew of
marriage counseling sessions.

1148
00:51:42.268 --> 00:51:43.770
Oh. we won't be long. I'm sure.

1149
00:51:43.812 --> 00:51:46.523
And as for this lovely couple.
(chuckles)

1150
00:51:46.564 --> 00:51:48.733
they already look like
forever to me.

1151
00:51:48.775 --> 00:51:50.318
Yes. they do.

1152
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:52.946
Well. this is unexpected.

1153
00:51:52.987 --> 00:51:57.283
This is a pleasant surprise.
but it's unexpected.

1154
00:51:57.325 --> 00:51:59.285
-It's a big commitment.
marriage... -Yeah.

1155
00:51:59.327 --> 00:52:00.829
SHAKURA:
...but. um...

1156
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.164
it always starts with
having God at the center.

1157
00:52:03.206 --> 00:52:04.499
That's how it lasts.

1158
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:05.875
-Mm-hmm. -Right?
-LEE-CURTIS: I'm sorry.

1159
00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:07.252
-What's-what's that. now?
-Uh...

1160
00:52:07.293 --> 00:52:08.670
KEON: You did come
for marriage counseling?

1161
00:52:08.712 --> 00:52:11.756
-We typically do newlyweds
or newly engaged. -Yeah.

1162
00:52:11.798 --> 00:52:14.009
But every so often.
we get a seasoned couple.

1163
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.176
-Sure.
-(Trinitie laughing)

1164
00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:17.137
No. that's not... (laughs)

1165
00:52:17.178 --> 00:52:19.806
-We don't. we don't need
counseling. Right? -Yes.

1166
00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:21.975
-Oh. God. Yes. Yes. -We counsel
plenty of folks ourselves.

1167
00:52:22.017 --> 00:52:23.643
-and believe me. uh.
-(laughing)

1168
00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:25.645
we're not the kind of marriage
that's in need. so...

1169
00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:28.231
-TRINITIE: Not at all.
-I see.

1170
00:52:28.273 --> 00:52:30.191
Then what can we do for you?

1171
00:52:30.233 --> 00:52:32.902
Well. Pastor Sumpter
and Pastor Sumpter.

1172
00:52:32.944 --> 00:52:34.362
(laughter)

1173
00:52:34.404 --> 00:52:36.197
No. it's your opening date
for your new location.

1174
00:52:36.239 --> 00:52:37.532
which is great. by the way.

1175
00:52:37.574 --> 00:52:38.992
-(whistles)
-Oh. it's so nice.

1176
00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:41.244
-Amen.
-We love it. (laughs)

1177
00:52:41.286 --> 00:52:42.829
I mean. don't get me wrong.

1178
00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:45.165
-This place is where we
got started. -SHAKURA: Mm-hmm.

1179
00:52:45.206 --> 00:52:47.167
KEON:
But Heaven House 2.0. ooh--

1180
00:52:47.208 --> 00:52:49.377
-it's gonna be amazing.
-TRINITIE: Oh. I bet.

1181
00:52:49.419 --> 00:52:50.670
-(laughing)
-Ah. I bet.

1182
00:52:50.712 --> 00:52:52.630
And I am sure
that the Lord is gonna be

1183
00:52:52.672 --> 00:52:54.758
-coursing right on up through
there when you open. -Oh. yeah.

1184
00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:57.010
It's just that... (sighs)

1185
00:52:57.052 --> 00:52:59.095
well. it can't be the fourth.

1186
00:52:59.137 --> 00:53:00.805
One more time. now.

1187
00:53:00.847 --> 00:53:03.308
LEE-CURTIS: Uh. she's saying
you-you can't open up.

1188
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:04.726
Not-not this Easter. All right?

1189
00:53:04.768 --> 00:53:06.478
-It-it doesn't work.
-Yes. exact--

1190
00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:09.689
-Thank you. honey. Thank you.
-Oh. Well. I...

1191
00:53:09.731 --> 00:53:12.359
I just don't see
how that's possible.

1192
00:53:14.486 --> 00:53:16.571
-Well. surely it's possible.
-Yes. Yes.

1193
00:53:16.613 --> 00:53:18.907
All-all things are possible
with God.

1194
00:53:18.948 --> 00:53:21.576
-That-That's Matthew 19:26.
-Come on. now. Yes. it is.

1195
00:53:21.618 --> 00:53:23.703
No. (chuckles)
I don't think it is.

1196
00:53:23.745 --> 00:53:28.166
See. uh... we've been
preparing for this day for

1197
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:30.293
-like a year now.
-Mm-hmm. Amen.

1198
00:53:30.335 --> 00:53:32.504
KEON:
It's a big step for us.

1199
00:53:32.545 --> 00:53:34.714
And. you know.
Easter is so perfect

1200
00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:36.633
-for something like this.
-(chuckles)

1201
00:53:36.675 --> 00:53:39.052
-A revival of sorts.
-TRINITIE: Right.

1202
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:40.637
Exactly.

1203
00:53:40.679 --> 00:53:43.723
And that is just what
Wander to Greater Paths needs.

1204
00:53:43.765 --> 00:53:44.808
A revival.

1205
00:53:44.849 --> 00:53:48.061
Uh. which is why
we also chose Easter.

1206
00:53:48.103 --> 00:53:49.521
-We did.
-You see?

1207
00:53:49.562 --> 00:53:52.565
And we chose that date
a while back. believe me.

1208
00:53:52.607 --> 00:53:55.902
So. really. it just comes down
to this point.

1209
00:53:55.944 --> 00:53:57.529
Um...

1210
00:53:58.738 --> 00:54:02.117
We cannot both reopen
our churches on Easter Sunday.

1211
00:54:02.158 --> 00:54:03.952
It would be. well. it would be

1212
00:54:03.993 --> 00:54:07.247
-too confusing for folks.
you know? -Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1213
00:54:07.288 --> 00:54:10.583
They would have to choose.
and. well...

1214
00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:12.085
Right.

1215
00:54:12.127 --> 00:54:14.963
They'll make their choice.
I think.

1216
00:54:17.424 --> 00:54:20.719
KEON:
Look. uh. we adore y'all.

1217
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.595
Really.

1218
00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:25.557
We used to be
congregation members at WTGP.

1219
00:54:25.598 --> 00:54:26.641
Right.

1220
00:54:26.683 --> 00:54:28.435
Until we struck out on our own.

1221
00:54:28.476 --> 00:54:30.270
Uh. it's just...

1222
00:54:30.311 --> 00:54:32.022
We belong here.

1223
00:54:32.063 --> 00:54:35.525
We believe in the Gospel.
and we believe in the Word

1224
00:54:35.567 --> 00:54:37.694
and all the hard work
that we've done

1225
00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:39.446
-to get to this place...
-KEON: Mm-hmm. Mm.

1226
00:54:39.487 --> 00:54:42.449
...where enough. uh.
enough people will hear us

1227
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.950
for it to make a difference.

1228
00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:45.285
That's all we've ever wanted.

1229
00:54:45.326 --> 00:54:49.497
So we can't do
what y'all are asking.

1230
00:54:49.539 --> 00:54:52.876
-What we can do is pray.
-Mm.

1231
00:54:52.917 --> 00:54:56.629
-That there are enough souls to
go around for all of us. -Amen.

1232
00:54:58.381 --> 00:55:00.300
Y'all want to pray?

1233
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:01.718
We got two gathered right here.

1234
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.219
-We are okay.
-Right. y'all.

1235
00:55:03.261 --> 00:55:04.137
-Y'all start it off.
-Yeah. you all.

1236
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:06.931
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.

1237
00:55:06.973 --> 00:55:08.475
All right.

1238
00:55:09.225 --> 00:55:10.685
-Heavenly Father...
-Mm.

1239
00:55:10.727 --> 00:55:12.479
...we thank you for this space
to come together

1240
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.857
-and build and heal
this community. Lord. -Amen.

1241
00:55:15.899 --> 00:55:17.776
SHAKURA:
We thank you for the grace

1242
00:55:17.817 --> 00:55:20.153
of these beautiful.
powerful leaders

1243
00:55:20.195 --> 00:55:21.738
coming in
and showing us the way.

1244
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.200
-being role models in
your mighty name. Lord. -Mm.

1245
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:27.160
-KEON: * Oh. Lord. *
-Hallelujah. Mm.

1246
00:55:27.202 --> 00:55:29.454
(gentle music playing quietly)

1247
00:55:30.455 --> 00:55:34.834
So. hey. we-we figure
something else out.

1248
00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:37.337
You know. we just--
we push forward.

1249
00:55:37.379 --> 00:55:38.880
Fuck the Sumpters.

1250
00:55:38.922 --> 00:55:42.676
I mean. bless them in
the work they do. but really.

1251
00:55:44.469 --> 00:55:45.845
Did you hear me?

1252
00:55:45.887 --> 00:55:48.723
-I said. we...
-Right. Right. Yeah. No.

1253
00:55:48.765 --> 00:55:51.059
Uh. baby. I heard you. (snorts)

1254
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:53.019
So I been thinking.

1255
00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:54.979
We do what we do best.

1256
00:55:55.021 --> 00:55:56.398
We outdo them.

1257
00:55:56.439 --> 00:55:58.191
We put on a show so good

1258
00:55:58.233 --> 00:56:00.402
-folks won't think twice
about another church. -Mm-hmm.

1259
00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:02.946
-Yeah. -They opening
this Easter Sunday.

1260
00:56:02.987 --> 00:56:03.947
Right?

1261
00:56:03.988 --> 00:56:05.907
So it's like you said.

1262
00:56:05.949 --> 00:56:07.534
Fuck 'em.

1263
00:56:07.575 --> 00:56:10.036
They just doing it to spite us.
I know it. You know it.

1264
00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:12.706
But there's no spiting us. baby.

1265
00:56:12.747 --> 00:56:13.790
Okay?

1266
00:56:13.832 --> 00:56:16.459
Easter is in
just under two weeks.

1267
00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:22.048
So. we reopen
this Sunday instead.

1268
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.091
(pops lips)

1269
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.930
-Wait. This Sunday?
-This Sunday.

1270
00:56:28.972 --> 00:56:31.224
No. But. baby. we can't--
we not-- we won't be ready.

1271
00:56:31.266 --> 00:56:32.851
-But this Sunday. we should...
-Now. think about it. baby.

1272
00:56:32.892 --> 00:56:35.562
Now is the perfect time
to come back.

1273
00:56:35.603 --> 00:56:38.189
See. everybody is
expecting Easter. right?

1274
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:39.566
It's when Jesus rose again.

1275
00:56:39.607 --> 00:56:41.067
But if you think back
to those times.

1276
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:44.696
nobody knew when he was coming.
if at all.

1277
00:56:44.738 --> 00:56:47.449
This is what it's really like
to embody the Lord

1278
00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.950
and walk in his image.

1279
00:56:48.992 --> 00:56:51.494
Jesus Christ was all about
the shock factor!

1280
00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:53.371
(stammers) Okay. listen. no.

1281
00:56:53.413 --> 00:56:54.497
-Yes.
-All right?

1282
00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:55.999
Listen. this is too much.

1283
00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:58.251
There would be so much to do
in just a few short days.

1284
00:56:58.293 --> 00:56:59.794
We-we-- No. no. no. we cannot.

1285
00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:02.005
It's Pastor
and Pastor Sumpter. Trin.

1286
00:57:02.047 --> 00:57:04.466
We can't compete
with a gimmick like that.

1287
00:57:04.507 --> 00:57:06.593
The Sumpters are snatching up
all our members.

1288
00:57:06.634 --> 00:57:09.137
and we need to do something
major to get them back.

1289
00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:10.513
And we can do it. baby.

1290
00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:13.266
We just got to make
a big enough fuss. right?

1291
00:57:13.308 --> 00:57:17.103
Pull out the pageantry.
really dramatize our return.

1292
00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:20.523
We gonna make a scene.
and it's gonna be so brilliant.

1293
00:57:20.565 --> 00:57:23.610
so seductive.

1294
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:25.278
people gonna come.

1295
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.364
They gonna come right on back.

1296
00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:28.531
Hey. look at me.

1297
00:57:28.573 --> 00:57:30.617
Look at me. Trin. Hey.

1298
00:57:30.658 --> 00:57:34.746
God built this whole world
in six days.

1299
00:57:34.788 --> 00:57:37.290
This whole big beautiful world.
all right?

1300
00:57:37.332 --> 00:57:38.958
Now. call me overzealous.

1301
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.128
but I think
I can rebuild ours in five.

1302
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.588
(growls)

1303
00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:46.716
Wait. Lee-Curtis.

1304
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:50.387
Wait. Lee-Curtis.
just listen to me. please.

1305
00:57:50.428 --> 00:57:51.930
-Lee...
-Come on!

1306
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:55.684
-* Tear it down *
-* We can make it *

1307
00:57:55.725 --> 00:57:57.060
* Start over again *

1308
00:57:57.102 --> 00:57:59.020
* We can make it *

1309
00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:01.147
* We can make
a brand-new start *

1310
00:58:01.189 --> 00:58:04.901
* Start over again... *

1311
00:58:04.943 --> 00:58:06.486
(song fades)

1312
00:58:06.528 --> 00:58:08.488
TRINITIE:
We went all in for this one.

1313
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.281
(laughs)

1314
00:58:10.323 --> 00:58:13.702
Lee-Curtis was blessed
with the most brilliant idea.

1315
00:58:13.743 --> 00:58:15.328
A roadside ministry.

1316
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.497
Wander to Greater Paths
opens back this Sunday!

1317
00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:19.499
Yeah! This Sunday!

1318
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:21.001
TRINITIE:
Now. this is the best way

1319
00:58:21.042 --> 00:58:22.669
to gain followers.

1320
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:26.131
You know. our style is-is...
is more. uh. grassroots.

1321
00:58:26.172 --> 00:58:27.924
more genuine.

1322
00:58:29.175 --> 00:58:31.553
Folks out here-- we do
this sort of thing all the time

1323
00:58:31.594 --> 00:58:33.013
in the name of God.

1324
00:58:33.054 --> 00:58:35.015
It's good. It's--
The more beeps the better.

1325
00:58:35.056 --> 00:58:37.809
It just. it just draws
attention to a worthy cause.

1326
00:58:37.851 --> 00:58:39.853
-And I cannot think of a cause
-(horn honks)

1327
00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:42.022
-more worthy than this right
here. -LEE-CURTIS: Hey. Trin!

1328
00:58:42.063 --> 00:58:45.316
-Huh? -You ain't really
getting that many beeps. baby.

1329
00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:46.568
Huh?

1330
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:48.570
-What you doing?
-What did you say to me?

1331
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:50.113
You gonna have to do
a little more.

1332
00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:52.866
Give them a show!
You know. come on. girl!

1333
00:58:52.907 --> 00:58:56.077
-Uh...
-Shake it for the Lord.

1334
00:58:56.119 --> 00:58:57.954
Shake it for the Lord.

1335
00:58:57.996 --> 00:59:00.123
-I said. get it for the Lord!
-Yeah. Yeah.

1336
00:59:00.165 --> 00:59:03.209
-Get them honks for the Lord!
-Yeah! Yeah! -(horn honks)

1337
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:06.212
Tap it on the patch!

1338
00:59:06.254 --> 00:59:07.505
Shake it for the Lord. girl.

1339
00:59:07.547 --> 00:59:08.965
Come on. now!

1340
00:59:09.007 --> 00:59:11.426
Shake it for the Lord. girl.

1341
00:59:11.468 --> 00:59:13.386
Mm. Shake it.

1342
00:59:13.428 --> 00:59:15.096
Hey!

1343
00:59:15.138 --> 00:59:18.224
You having
a blessed day. sweetie?

1344
00:59:18.266 --> 00:59:19.851
Huh?

1345
00:59:19.893 --> 00:59:22.604
Well. come on down
to Wander to Greater Paths.

1346
00:59:22.645 --> 00:59:25.482
We are back in action
this Sunday!

1347
00:59:25.523 --> 00:59:27.734
And it is gonna be amazing!

1348
00:59:27.776 --> 00:59:29.402
I can guarantee it!

1349
00:59:29.444 --> 00:59:31.363
(horn honking)

1350
00:59:31.404 --> 00:59:33.656
* *

1351
00:59:47.045 --> 00:59:49.130
(horn honking)

1352
00:59:57.889 --> 00:59:59.849
LEE-CURTIS:
The spirit of the Lord

1353
00:59:59.891 --> 01:00:02.435
is upon my heart.
ladies and gentlemen.

1354
01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:04.020
And that's what we are.

1355
01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:07.774
We are unique emanations
of love. joy and divine beauty.

1356
01:00:07.816 --> 01:00:10.110
-(horns honking) -Praise him!
-Heavenly Father. allow me

1357
01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.778
to minister these people
in the way

1358
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.363
-in which they need to be.
-Yes. Lord!

1359
01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:14.572
(Lee-Curtis speaking in tongues)

1360
01:00:14.614 --> 01:00:16.116
TRINITIE:
Hmm. Uh. the settlement.

1361
01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:18.618
I'm not sure
that I can address that.

1362
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.871
Uh. that's a bit difficult
for us. legally.

1363
01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:25.125
But that's all over
and done with. so...

1364
01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:29.462
Okay. okay. but. um... (laughs)

1365
01:00:29.504 --> 01:00:32.257
you want to hear about
something really difficult?

1366
01:00:32.298 --> 01:00:33.675
Okay. so get this.

1367
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.469
Um. did you know that. uh...

1368
01:00:36.511 --> 01:00:37.804
(laughs)

1369
01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:39.806
...when we first started
going together.

1370
01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:43.852
Lee-Curtis was Baptist
and I was Apostolic?

1371
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:48.148
(laughs):
And that's true.

1372
01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:49.566
Honk for the Lord!

1373
01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:52.485
So. yeah. we. um.
we know discomfort. believe me.

1374
01:00:52.527 --> 01:00:54.529
-A little roadside spectacle?
-(both continue shouting)

1375
01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:55.822
It's nothing.

1376
01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:57.657
Yeah. we make it work.

1377
01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.325
Dynamic duo.

1378
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:01.244
(laughs)

1379
01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:03.747
Yep. Batman and--

1380
01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:07.334
Oh. no. that's two guys. so...

1381
01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:09.502
Uh...

1382
01:01:09.544 --> 01:01:11.171
LEE-CURTIS:
I never said I was

1383
01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:13.923
a perfect man.
ladies and gentlemen.

1384
01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:16.676
God doesn't make perfect men.

1385
01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:18.428
(horn honking)

1386
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:23.058
But what I am is a follower
of the Lord and his teach...

1387
01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:28.355
(exhaling sharply)

1388
01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:38.782
-(horn honks)
-WOMAN: Hey!

1389
01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:42.994
Well. hello there.

1390
01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.829
It is a beautiful day
for worship.

1391
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.331
Are you looking for
a church home?

1392
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:49.501
'Cause Wander to Greater Paths
Baptist is back.

1393
01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:50.543
(mocking laugh):
Oh!

1394
01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:52.545
Oh. ain't this some shit.

1395
01:01:52.587 --> 01:01:54.130
(mocking laugh):
Oh.

1396
01:01:55.173 --> 01:01:57.050
LEE-CURTIS:
God doesn't make perfect men.

1397
01:01:57.092 --> 01:02:03.056
But what I am is a follower of
the Lord and his teachings...

1398
01:02:07.435 --> 01:02:08.728
Uh-uh! Just fucking nasty!

1399
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.313
-Just fucking nasty!
-Just stop.

1400
01:02:10.355 --> 01:02:12.065
All of y'all up in there
is disgusting!

1401
01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:14.359
Especially your
fuck-ass husband!

1402
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:16.403
I'm not a perfect man.
ladies and gentlemen.

1403
01:02:16.444 --> 01:02:17.612
But I'm also not the man

1404
01:02:17.654 --> 01:02:19.030
that the media is
making me out to be.

1405
01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.448
(grunts)

1406
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:22.534
You know. your nigga found
a fucking loophole. right?

1407
01:02:22.575 --> 01:02:24.077
Yeah. a fucking loophole!

1408
01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:25.829
Trying not to repeat the actions

1409
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:27.414
that got me here
in the first place.

1410
01:02:27.455 --> 01:02:29.207
-Anita. we don't need
to get this. -Yeah. Uh-huh.

1411
01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:30.458
Lee-Curtis--
he'll be right back.

1412
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.710
so you can just stop shooting.

1413
01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:33.086
And for every sin
I've committed.

1414
01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:35.588
I have prayed equally as much.

1415
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:37.048
I've been down on bent knee.

1416
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:39.092
-God knows that...
-MONTERIUS: Pastor Childs.

1417
01:02:39.884 --> 01:02:42.721
Uh. hello. Uh...

1418
01:02:42.762 --> 01:02:44.806
M-Monterius West. Pastor.

1419
01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:47.475
Uh. I'm a member of
Wander to Greater Paths.

1420
01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:49.769
W-Well. I was until...

1421
01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.813
-Are you. now?
-Yes. sir.

1422
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.106
I love your sermons.

1423
01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.649
Especially on the holidays

1424
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:56.443
when y'all break out
them laser lights.

1425
01:02:56.484 --> 01:02:58.278
Them laser lights my favorite.

1426
01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:01.114
Uh. yeah.
I started that. you know?

1427
01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:03.575
Other churches doing it now.
but I was the first.

1428
01:03:03.616 --> 01:03:05.368
(chuckles) I believe that.

1429
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.287
Uh. anyway. sir.
I saw you over here

1430
01:03:07.328 --> 01:03:10.040
while I was picking up
down the way. and. uh.

1431
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.834
I hear y'all about to be
back preaching. and. uh...

1432
01:03:14.044 --> 01:03:16.421
...I just want to thank you.
Pastor Childs.

1433
01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:18.590
My old lady brought me
to your Easter service

1434
01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:20.467
a few years back. and...

1435
01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:22.469
I been a different man
ever since. you know?

1436
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:24.137
I-I don't really believe in
all that mess

1437
01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:25.847
they saying about you
in the news

1438
01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.058
and in the paper and stuff.

1439
01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:29.851
I know you a good man.
Pastor Childs.

1440
01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.603
and you gonna keep doing
them good thing

1441
01:03:31.644 --> 01:03:32.854
God be telling you to do

1442
01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:36.316
and keep inspiring
folks like me.

1443
01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:38.193
I believe that.

1444
01:04:16.147 --> 01:04:18.191
Thanks for that. brother.

1445
01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.821
Yes. sir.

1446
01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:24.155
WOMAN:
You got your jewelry.

1447
01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:26.241
your dresses
and your weak-ass hats.

1448
01:04:26.282 --> 01:04:28.368
That's the real
foul-ass shit. bitch!

1449
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.953
Real weak-ass shit!

1450
01:04:29.994 --> 01:04:33.498
-Fuck you. bitch! Yeah. Uh-huh.
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

1451
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.041
Let me tell you something.

1452
01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:38.837
Me and my husband-- we practice
love and forgiveness.

1453
01:04:38.878 --> 01:04:40.588
We are Christians.

1454
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.257
Not saints and not God.

1455
01:04:42.298 --> 01:04:45.552
And we are doing
the best we fucking can!

1456
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.890
Girl. fuck you!

1457
01:04:50.932 --> 01:04:52.934
Fuck you!

1458
01:04:56.354 --> 01:04:58.356
God bless!

1459
01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:00.608
(horns honking)

1460
01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:04.904
LEE-CURTIS: I'm not a perfect
man. ladies and gentlemen.

1461
01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:07.949
God doesn't make perfect men.

1462
01:05:08.783 --> 01:05:10.952
-What I am...
-TRINITIE: No.

1463
01:05:11.745 --> 01:05:13.079
Nope. Nope.

1464
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:16.750
See. uh. that's too distant.
Lee-Curtis.

1465
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.418
We need to connect with people.

1466
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.714
Make them feel why they need
you back in that pulpit.

1467
01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:26.718
You're not gonna sit
center pew like always?

1468
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.219
Uh-uh. No. no. no. no. no.

1469
01:05:28.261 --> 01:05:31.264
I-I want the view of the
average. everyday congregant.

1470
01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:34.142
All right. (sighs) Now go on.

1471
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.900
I'm not a perfect man.
ladies and gentlemen.

1472
01:05:41.941 --> 01:05:45.236
God doesn't make perfect men.

1473
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:49.282
What I am is
a servant of the Lord.

1474
01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:51.284
-Now. a servant of the Lord...
-Wait.

1475
01:05:51.326 --> 01:05:54.037
-(sighs) Wait.
-Hmm?

1476
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:57.207
Where's your gut. hon?

1477
01:05:57.248 --> 01:05:58.792
Hmm?

1478
01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:02.796
I-I'm not feeling
any transference of raw energy.

1479
01:06:02.837 --> 01:06:04.297
You know
what I'm talking about.

1480
01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.549
That's the stuff people love.

1481
01:06:06.591 --> 01:06:08.301
Well. you won't even let me
get up to that part. Trin.

1482
01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:10.428
See. I got to ramp up to it.

1483
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.138
Okay. go ahead. then.
Ramp up to it.

1484
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.515
I'm gonna be quiet.

1485
01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:19.270
Ramp up. (chuckles)

1486
01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:22.232
I...

1487
01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:25.318
...am not a perfect man.
ladies and gentlemen.

1488
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.737
God doesn't make perfect men.

1489
01:06:27.779 --> 01:06:30.323
What I am...

1490
01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:32.450
is a servant of the Lord.

1491
01:06:32.492 --> 01:06:35.495
And. folks. being
the Lord's servant doesn't mean

1492
01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:39.207
that you are not susceptible
to being lured or seduced

1493
01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:42.544
or ambushed by the devil.

1494
01:06:43.628 --> 01:06:47.716
But here is
the true test of faith.

1495
01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:53.013
See. the true test
doesn't happen when you falter.

1496
01:06:53.054 --> 01:06:54.097
Okay?

1497
01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:55.724
It is when you're low.

1498
01:06:55.765 --> 01:06:58.810
probably at the lowest you have
ever been in your life.

1499
01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:01.438
but you overcome it.

1500
01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:04.774
Mm-hmm.

1501
01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:07.360
Yes. Yes!

1502
01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:08.820
* *

1503
01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:12.240
There ain't a person up in here
that hasn't been tested.

1504
01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:16.036
tempted or torn up
by hell's angel.

1505
01:07:16.077 --> 01:07:18.538
But we survive.

1506
01:07:19.581 --> 01:07:21.958
Stronger.

1507
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.044
happier

1508
01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:26.963
and better to serve
than ever before.

1509
01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.466
Hey. Mm.

1510
01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:32.385
(laughs):
I'm better. y'all!

1511
01:07:32.427 --> 01:07:37.849
I am better and bigger
in the eyes of Jesus Christ.

1512
01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.351
And that is through the pain

1513
01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:43.355
and through the threats
of losing everything.

1514
01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:50.195
The things I've been through...

1515
01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:54.115
...had me wanting
not another minute

1516
01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:57.619
on God's beautiful earth.

1517
01:08:02.874 --> 01:08:07.587
But it was my faith in him
that allowed me to persevere.

1518
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:15.303
It was his glory and his grace
that brought me back here.

1519
01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:19.391
Back in front of you all and
back in the house of the Lord

1520
01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:22.560
where I am supposed to be!

1521
01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:25.230
Come on. now!

1522
01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:31.778
No. no. I am not
a perfect man. everyone.

1523
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.321
Like I said before.

1524
01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:37.242
God ain't exactly in the
business of making perfect men.

1525
01:08:39.619 --> 01:08:43.039
But with his guidance
and his love--

1526
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:45.458
oh. Jesus--

1527
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.962
his undying
and everlasting love.

1528
01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:53.800
he can and he does
make great men.

1529
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.768
Oh. you're done.

1530
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.687
Okay. well. that-that was.
that was great.

1531
01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.231
That was great. Lee-Curtis.
Really great. Yep.

1532
01:09:09.315 --> 01:09:13.069
But for our first Sunday back
after all of this.

1533
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:16.406
that just doesn't ring.

1534
01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:19.701
See. you don't quite
acknowledge...

1535
01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:23.329
If you're trying
to make people--

1536
01:09:23.371 --> 01:09:26.416
if you think you can
fool people into thinking...

1537
01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.878
Well. you're just gonna have
to do a little bit better than

1538
01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:33.131
just dry excuses this time. hon.

1539
01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:36.009
When we get people
back up in here.

1540
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:39.220
we need to give them everything.

1541
01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:44.059
That was everything.

1542
01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:48.772
That up there--
that was my soul.

1543
01:09:48.813 --> 01:09:50.690
And it's not dry.

1544
01:09:51.775 --> 01:09:53.735
That was the truth.

1545
01:09:57.322 --> 01:09:59.407
Then we should probably practice

1546
01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:02.535
and make it
a little more convincing. huh?

1547
01:10:12.128 --> 01:10:13.672
Trin?

1548
01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:17.175
Yeah?

1549
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.927
You up. baby?

1550
01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:21.554
Yeah. I'm up. Lee-Curtis.

1551
01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:23.723
(Lee-Curtis breathes deeply)

1552
01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.266
Me. too.

1553
01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:28.853
Something's not right.

1554
01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:31.523
We hurtling towards Sunday.

1555
01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:34.901
and something doesn't feel
quite there yet.

1556
01:10:36.069 --> 01:10:39.239
We just not really...

1557
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.533
hitting it yet.

1558
01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:46.037
We need to do something big
out there for this last day.

1559
01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:49.040
Something with a little oomph.

1560
01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:53.336
Could really use
your brain on this.

1561
01:10:55.213 --> 01:10:57.465
I'll have to think on it.

1562
01:11:00.844 --> 01:11:02.929
Yeah. All right.

1563
01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:07.600
(Trinitie sighs)

1564
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.621
(quietly):
Mama?

1565
01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.250
(laughs)

1566
01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.461
-This is too much. Mama.
-(grunts)

1567
01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:36.338
You don't know
what you're saying. (chuckles)

1568
01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.214
Are you sure you don't want

1569
01:11:38.256 --> 01:11:40.216
Lee-Curtis to come down
and get some?

1570
01:11:40.258 --> 01:11:43.428
Uh. well. he'll be
a while longer.

1571
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.431
Uh. I had to slip him
two Ambien last night

1572
01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:49.726
just to get him to simmer down.

1573
01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:53.021
He likes it. Don't worry.

1574
01:11:54.022 --> 01:11:56.107
So. out with it.

1575
01:11:58.151 --> 01:11:59.444
It's our last shot.

1576
01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:00.987
Oh. girl. please.

1577
01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.864
I don't know what's gonna
happen if we don't make it.

1578
01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:05.450
I'm sure some folks
will show up on Sunday.

1579
01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:09.621
I mean me and Lee-Curtis.

1580
01:12:10.872 --> 01:12:12.707
I don't know

1581
01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:15.085
(voice breaking):
if we can make it.

1582
01:12:15.126 --> 01:12:16.544
I just...

1583
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.173
I'm here. I'm there.
I'm everywhere.

1584
01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:25.679
And I am working my butt off
for this man and this marriage.

1585
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.725
And so is he. you know.

1586
01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:33.103
He is working. too. I see that.

1587
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:35.814
I just...

1588
01:12:35.855 --> 01:12:38.358
I just don't know if-if
we're just working towards

1589
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.901
the same thing.

1590
01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:45.699
Wow.

1591
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:52.664
Sometimes my child can be
so damn foolish.

1592
01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:55.917
Are you a Christian?

1593
01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.293
I'm a Christian.

1594
01:12:57.335 --> 01:13:00.088
Say it again
so I'm absolutely sure.

1595
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.968
-I'm a Christian. Mama.
-That's good.

1596
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:07.846
'Cause you didn't
sound like it for a moment.

1597
01:13:07.887 --> 01:13:08.930
(scoffs)

1598
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:10.640
You don't know
if this is gonna work.

1599
01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:13.184
That's not for you to know.

1600
01:13:13.226 --> 01:13:15.770
That's for God to determine.

1601
01:13:16.646 --> 01:13:19.482
And he did that
15-something years ago

1602
01:13:19.524 --> 01:13:21.401
when he blessed y'all's union.

1603
01:13:21.443 --> 01:13:23.737
And look at
all the other blessings

1604
01:13:23.778 --> 01:13:26.114
that you have right now
because of what?

1605
01:13:26.156 --> 01:13:31.036
That man and your God.

1606
01:13:31.077 --> 01:13:33.079
The young.

1607
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.873
So ready to quit.

1608
01:13:34.914 --> 01:13:37.792
Don't you think I thought about
quitting your daddy?

1609
01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:43.548
But every time I got shook.
I went right back to the Bible.

1610
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:47.427
back to the Word.
prayed it on out.

1611
01:13:47.469 --> 01:13:50.930
And then I went back
to my husband.

1612
01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:53.641
(sighs)

1613
01:13:53.683 --> 01:13:55.727
And when did you have to stop

1614
01:13:55.769 --> 01:13:59.481
running back to the Bible
about Daddy?

1615
01:14:00.273 --> 01:14:02.609
(chuckles)

1616
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:05.070
When I buried him. baby.

1617
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:07.697
(Sabina laughs)

1618
01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:10.700
LEE-CURTIS:
Hey there. Mama Sabina!

1619
01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:13.036
SABINA:
Hey. love!

1620
01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:15.538
LEE-CURTIS:
Y'all eating biscuits?

1621
01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.416
TRINITIE:
You know what I said to God

1622
01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.168
during my prayers last night?

1623
01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:24.589
I said. "Lord. show me the way.

1624
01:14:24.631 --> 01:14:27.842
"Show me what I need
on this final day

1625
01:14:27.884 --> 01:14:30.470
of the most important week
of our lives."

1626
01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:34.307
(chuckles):
And then you know what he did?

1627
01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:35.975
* *

1628
01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:38.645
Lee-Curtis. you know.
he wanted a little more oomph.

1629
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.523
So. this is it. right?

1630
01:14:41.564 --> 01:14:43.400
This is the statement.

1631
01:14:43.441 --> 01:14:46.111
This is. "He is risen."

1632
01:14:46.861 --> 01:14:48.822
One time. I broke my toe.

1633
01:14:48.863 --> 01:14:51.324
I didn't think I was gonna be
ready for one of our services.

1634
01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:54.327
It was a women's ministry.
I prayed.

1635
01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:56.663
It was the baby toe.
There's no cast.

1636
01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:59.708
And I was in heels in.
I'd say. 48 hours?

1637
01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:02.168
So I've seen miracles.

1638
01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.129
LEE-CURTIS:
The Lord. ladies and gentlemen.

1639
01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:07.841
is the be-all and end-all
of your eternity.

1640
01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:09.509
-TRINITIE: Yes. he is.
-And eternity...

1641
01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:11.928
-(horn honking)
-Oh. yeah! Uh. what? What?

1642
01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:13.972
-First one. First one.
-That's one.

1643
01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:15.015
Yes!

1644
01:15:15.056 --> 01:15:16.891
-God loves you.
-Yes. he does.

1645
01:15:16.933 --> 01:15:18.685
-God loves you. baby.
-God loves you.

1646
01:15:18.727 --> 01:15:21.563
-* Well. God loves you *
-* God loves you *

1647
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.440
-* God loves you *
-(horn honks) -Yes!

1648
01:15:23.481 --> 01:15:25.025
-Yo! That's two!
-Two.

1649
01:15:25.066 --> 01:15:27.694
-That's two. All right.
All right. All right. -(laughs)

1650
01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:29.070
-(horn honking) -We bumping
for Jesus over here.

1651
01:15:29.112 --> 01:15:31.364
-Bump for Jesus. everybody.
-Come on. now.

1652
01:15:31.406 --> 01:15:33.742
-* Hallelujah *
-Harlem shake.

1653
01:15:33.783 --> 01:15:35.785
-* Lord Jes... * -(horn honks)
-For the Lord.

1654
01:15:35.827 --> 01:15:37.871
That's right.
That's right. my sister.

1655
01:15:37.912 --> 01:15:40.206
He got tears coming down his
eyes but a smile on his face.

1656
01:15:40.248 --> 01:15:41.875
We should all be like that
for the Lord.

1657
01:15:41.916 --> 01:15:43.543
We should all be so grateful.

1658
01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:44.961
-(horn honks)
-I see him! -Yes! Amen!

1659
01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:47.589
-(honking horns continue)
-Praise God. Praise God.

1660
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.090
-(Trinitie sings)
-LEE-CURTIS: You ain't ready!

1661
01:15:49.132 --> 01:15:51.134
-(Trinitie shouting excitedly)
-You ain't ready!

1662
01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:01.603
The only place you need to be
in a rush to go to

1663
01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.730
is heaven up above.

1664
01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:07.901
Ain't nothing on this plane
of any importance.

1665
01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:10.737
Hello. Hey. come on. now.

1666
01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:15.825
Trin.

1667
01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:18.244
-Hey. Trin.
-Huh?

1668
01:16:18.286 --> 01:16:19.913
Hey. baby. look. um.

1669
01:16:19.954 --> 01:16:22.916
we haven't been getting
all that many beeps as of late.

1670
01:16:22.957 --> 01:16:27.462
and I think. uh. well. I got
an idea for something bigger

1671
01:16:27.504 --> 01:16:28.922
to really get
these folks' attention.

1672
01:16:28.963 --> 01:16:31.091
Well. wasn't that
what our dear friend Jesus

1673
01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:32.509
was here for. hon?

1674
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:35.261
Jesus is real great. and
it was a brilliant idea. baby.

1675
01:16:35.303 --> 01:16:37.597
And he was a huge help
getting folks hyped for Sunday.

1676
01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:39.265
It's just-- I'm talking about

1677
01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:42.018
sealing this thing up
with a bang. right?

1678
01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.728
Putting on a real performance.

1679
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:45.438
-Show them that we back...
-Mm-hmm.

1680
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.941
...and we better than ever
and that we are serious about

1681
01:16:47.982 --> 01:16:49.734
saving their everlasting souls.

1682
01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:54.155
But maybe something like...

1683
01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:08.378
No.

1684
01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.797
No. You cannot be serious.

1685
01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:12.841
It would be outstanding. baby!

1686
01:17:12.882 --> 01:17:15.635
We got to draw them
back in. Trin.

1687
01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:17.887
Make them remember
what they were missing.

1688
01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:21.433
This is it. baby.
This is what we need.

1689
01:17:21.474 --> 01:17:24.144
-I...
-Trin.

1690
01:17:24.185 --> 01:17:25.353
this right here...

1691
01:17:26.521 --> 01:17:27.897
...this is ego.

1692
01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:29.315
You know what ego is?

1693
01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:31.317
That is edging God out.

1694
01:17:31.359 --> 01:17:34.154
And that's what
you're doing right now.

1695
01:17:34.195 --> 01:17:35.697
Now. are you really
gonna be the barrier

1696
01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:39.200
that keeps me
from saving souls?!

1697
01:17:39.242 --> 01:17:40.493
Hey. Trin. look at me.

1698
01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:42.078
You look at me now. okay?

1699
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.081
I need this.

1700
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.711
I need to save souls. baby.

1701
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:52.047
(siren wailing)

1702
01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:08.438
* *

1703
01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:27.040
* Never would've made it *

1704
01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:29.542
(people shouting. clapping)

1705
01:18:29.584 --> 01:18:32.837
* I would have lost it all *

1706
01:18:32.879 --> 01:18:37.759
* But now I see
how you were there for me *

1707
01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:40.053
* And I can say *

1708
01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:43.598
* Never would've made it *

1709
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.975
* Oh. I never could've made it *

1710
01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:51.398
* Never could've made it
without you *

1711
01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:53.942
* I would've lost my mind *

1712
01:18:53.983 --> 01:18:56.069
* A long time ago *

1713
01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:58.988
* If it had not been for you *

1714
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.909
* I... I'm stronger *

1715
01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:04.411
* I'm stronger *

1716
01:19:04.452 --> 01:19:06.246
-* I'm wiser *
-* I'm wiser*

1717
01:19:06.287 --> 01:19:08.498
-(horn honking)
-* And now I'm better *

1718
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.166
* I'm better*

1719
01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:12.752
-* So much better *
-* Much better...*

1720
01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:14.254
TRINITIE:
Let me just tell you

1721
01:19:14.295 --> 01:19:16.047
a little something
about praise mimes.

1722
01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:19.092
When it comes down to it.
they are entertainers.

1723
01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:22.178
You know. a-a... a sideshow.

1724
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.471
And...

1725
01:19:23.513 --> 01:19:27.559
You know. Lee-Curtis is
a talent. a... a star.

1726
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.728
but he's so raw.

1727
01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:31.771
He's-he's... he's raw.

1728
01:19:31.813 --> 01:19:35.775
He... he needs someone
to harness it all. and...

1729
01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:38.403
(song continues quietly)

1730
01:19:38.445 --> 01:19:40.280
...I did that.

1731
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:42.323
I am not an unreasonable person.

1732
01:19:42.365 --> 01:19:46.327
but to have his first lady--
I mean. his wife...

1733
01:19:48.329 --> 01:19:52.459
...out here on the side
of the road reduced to...

1734
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.795
* All I need is
just one more time *

1735
01:19:55.837 --> 01:19:58.131
* Everybody. sing with me *

1736
01:19:58.173 --> 01:20:01.301
-* Never would've made it...*
-(chuckles)

1737
01:20:01.343 --> 01:20:04.220
(gospel music playing
over stereo)

1738
01:20:04.262 --> 01:20:05.930
LEE-CURTIS (over bullhorn):
Everybody. come get

1739
01:20:05.972 --> 01:20:07.682
-your spiritual food.
-(horn honks)

1740
01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:10.143
You take care of your body.
You take care of your mind.

1741
01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:11.519
Come take care of your soul

1742
01:20:11.561 --> 01:20:14.314
at Wander to Greater Paths
Baptist Church.

1743
01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:16.566
Open this Sunday!

1744
01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:18.068
God bless you.

1745
01:20:18.109 --> 01:20:20.487
(rap music playing quietly
over car stereo)

1746
01:20:20.528 --> 01:20:22.655
-You want to give a honk
for Jesus? -Yes. sir.

1747
01:20:22.697 --> 01:20:24.991
Yes. sir. How you doing?

1748
01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:29.412
Wander to Greater Paths Baptist
Church open this Sunday.

1749
01:20:29.454 --> 01:20:32.290
-(horns honking) -Yeah! Hey.
-MAN: Hey. y'all got to move.

1750
01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:34.125
-LEE-CURTIS: Hey. hey. hey.
-MAN: People got places to go.

1751
01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:36.169
Khalil. I think you're
holding up traffic. honey.

1752
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:38.672
LEE-CURTIS: ...living
deep down in your soul.

1753
01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:39.964
WOMAN:
Can you go?!

1754
01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:41.633
LEE-CURTIS:
How can you not be weird?

1755
01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.051
How can you not be strange?

1756
01:20:43.093 --> 01:20:44.636
-MAN: Move your car!
-You got to let it out.

1757
01:20:44.678 --> 01:20:46.137
Listen to me. Khalil.

1758
01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:50.100
The pastor-- he is truly
repentant about everything.

1759
01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:51.935
And I can promise you that.

1760
01:20:51.976 --> 01:20:53.019
I can. I can.

1761
01:20:53.061 --> 01:20:55.438
He is. he is better.

1762
01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.940
LEE-CURTIS:
Hey. now.

1763
01:20:56.981 --> 01:20:59.067
MAN: Hey. y'all got to move.
We got places to go!

1764
01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.652
(horns continue honking)

1765
01:21:00.694 --> 01:21:02.278
You can't do this.

1766
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.699
We are trying really hard
to make things right again.

1767
01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.951
get everything back
to normal again.

1768
01:21:07.992 --> 01:21:11.287
He's back right with God.

1769
01:21:11.329 --> 01:21:13.206
All right?

1770
01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:14.916
He is.

1771
01:21:17.127 --> 01:21:19.587
(horns continue honking)

1772
01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:23.758
Well. uh...

1773
01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:28.138
Anyway. we don't really need
to be discussing this. do we?

1774
01:21:28.179 --> 01:21:31.224
You know what the terms of
the settlement are. so I...

1775
01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:33.059
SHEROD:
Yo. hey. Yo. hey!

1776
01:21:33.101 --> 01:21:35.895
Come on. man. I can't just
park my shit right here.

1777
01:21:35.937 --> 01:21:37.564
TRINITIE:
Please don't do this.

1778
01:21:37.605 --> 01:21:38.898
Please. Kha...

1779
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.734
Please. Khalil. don't do this.

1780
01:21:40.775 --> 01:21:41.985
Don't.

1781
01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:44.279
-(honking stops)
-(traffic passing)

1782
01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:07.344
Hey. stop. Don't...

1783
01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:15.977
(Khalil laughs)

1784
01:22:16.019 --> 01:22:17.479
Stop. man.

1785
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.815
(laughing)

1786
01:22:20.857 --> 01:22:23.485
Come on. now.
you don't have to...

1787
01:22:23.526 --> 01:22:25.779
Let's just
gather ourselves toget...

1788
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.406
(Khalil continues laughing.
clapping)

1789
01:22:30.116 --> 01:22:32.118
What do you want me
to say here. okay?

1790
01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.578
I'm just trying
to get myself back on track

1791
01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.538
so I can do the good work
for the Lord. that's all.

1792
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.084
You know. hey. can we just cut
for a minute here. please?

1793
01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:40.960
Everybody. just take a--

1794
01:22:41.002 --> 01:22:43.296
Let's just take ten. okay?

1795
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.258
Can we take ten?

1796
01:22:52.764 --> 01:22:54.349
Yo...

1797
01:22:55.266 --> 01:22:57.352
...you still like me. man?

1798
01:23:00.146 --> 01:23:02.524
Be real with me. man.
What was it? What?

1799
01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:06.361
Young broke niggas
your weakness?

1800
01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.827
I needed you back then. man.

1801
01:23:13.868 --> 01:23:15.870
I really did.

1802
01:23:15.912 --> 01:23:17.956
It's fucking stupid. I know.

1803
01:23:17.997 --> 01:23:21.042
I didn't realize
it wasn't just me.

1804
01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:23.086
-That's...
-I wasn't the only one

1805
01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:24.671
walking around
with brand-new shoes

1806
01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:27.465
and a Camaro?

1807
01:23:27.507 --> 01:23:29.050
Huh?

1808
01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:33.304
That's that shit.
That's that shit you do to...

1809
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:41.396
This city don't need you. man.

1810
01:23:42.355 --> 01:23:46.735
We've all been doing
really good without you.

1811
01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:50.071
Nobody needs you.

1812
01:23:50.113 --> 01:23:52.032
Nobody needs your suits.

1813
01:23:52.073 --> 01:23:54.701
Nobody needs your fucking
green screen backdrops

1814
01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:56.036
of the Last Supper.

1815
01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:57.078
We don't need it.

1816
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.580
Shut up!

1817
01:23:58.621 --> 01:24:00.081
Shut the...

1818
01:24:00.123 --> 01:24:01.416
Shut up.

1819
01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.251
You watch the way
you talk to me. boy.

1820
01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:06.838
I still got a lot of good
to do in this world.

1821
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.090
A lot of souls to be saved.

1822
01:24:09.132 --> 01:24:12.302
I saved myself.

1823
01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:16.473
Now. I don't know about

1824
01:24:16.514 --> 01:24:18.600
all that other stuff
that you was talking about.

1825
01:24:18.641 --> 01:24:22.479
but what I do know
is that I did try to save you.

1826
01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.189
I really did.

1827
01:24:25.857 --> 01:24:28.068
Now. you...

1828
01:24:28.109 --> 01:24:30.236
you may be beyond me.

1829
01:24:30.278 --> 01:24:32.989
You may be beyond
what I can do for you.

1830
01:24:33.031 --> 01:24:34.616
TRINITIE:
Wait!

1831
01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:45.794
Fuck you. nigga.

1832
01:24:56.388 --> 01:24:59.432
-(car door opens. closes)
-(rap music playing)

1833
01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:01.726
(car driving off.
tires squealing)

1834
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:10.735
(sniffles)

1835
01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:12.278
How do you know

1836
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.948
if you're standing in the way
of your own blessings?

1837
01:25:14.989 --> 01:25:16.616
-(Lee-Curtis chuckles)
-(bullhorn feedback squeaks)

1838
01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:18.785
See. sometimes
you got to step aside

1839
01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:21.788
so the Lord can show up
and work for you.

1840
01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:24.416
Hey. Trin!

1841
01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:27.460
Hey. babe. can you give me
another battery. please?

1842
01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:30.130
This thing seems to be
going out on...

1843
01:25:30.171 --> 01:25:31.881
-Trin?
-(feedback squeaks)

1844
01:25:31.923 --> 01:25:34.342
Trin? Trinitie!

1845
01:25:35.218 --> 01:25:37.887
No. No.

1846
01:25:37.929 --> 01:25:40.181
She's fine.

1847
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.979
Besides all that.
what happened over there--

1848
01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:47.939
that's not what this is about.

1849
01:25:49.357 --> 01:25:51.484
That's not why
you all are here. okay?

1850
01:25:51.526 --> 01:25:53.987
We've moved on from that.

1851
01:25:54.029 --> 01:25:56.656
-This is about rebirth...
-Stop.

1852
01:25:56.698 --> 01:25:59.117
-...and renewal
-(Trinitie panting)

1853
01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:01.745
and resurrection from the dead.

1854
01:26:01.786 --> 01:26:04.289
-TRINITIE: Fuck!
-That's what this is about.

1855
01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:05.832
(Trinitie groans)

1856
01:26:05.874 --> 01:26:08.376
* *

1857
01:26:14.466 --> 01:26:16.885
All right. that's it now.
We are done.

1858
01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:20.263
LEE-CURTIS:
Because I'm here. baby.

1859
01:26:21.056 --> 01:26:23.350
And I'm not going anywhere.

1860
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.860
TRINITIE:
I said I am done. so take it.

1861
01:26:33.902 --> 01:26:36.780
do with it what you will
because I am done!

1862
01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.201
You came. you silently judged.

1863
01:26:41.242 --> 01:26:43.578
you poked. and you got it.
didn't you?

1864
01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.456
You got what you came for.
so just leave.

1865
01:26:46.498 --> 01:26:48.083
-Jesus Christ! No.
-LEE-CURTIS: Trinitie.

1866
01:26:48.124 --> 01:26:50.126
-Let's get ourselves together
here. -No. no. no. no. no.

1867
01:26:50.168 --> 01:26:51.503
-Okay?
-Not now. No!

1868
01:26:51.544 --> 01:26:54.047
-Hey. it's o... okay.
-Not now! Not you!

1869
01:26:54.089 --> 01:26:55.548
-Trinitie.
-I am serious. Lee-Curtis.

1870
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.884
-Do not touch me.
-Okay. Okay.

1871
01:26:57.926 --> 01:27:00.762
-Do not even breathe
near me right now. -I won't.

1872
01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:05.975
What do you all want
from me? Huh?

1873
01:27:07.519 --> 01:27:11.272
All of you.
what the fuck do you want?

1874
01:27:11.314 --> 01:27:13.233
You want it on the record?
Is that it?

1875
01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:15.944
Is that. is that. is that what
you want? Okay. fine. Fine.

1876
01:27:15.985 --> 01:27:18.697
Yes. there was a point in my
marriage where I did not think

1877
01:27:18.738 --> 01:27:20.407
that we could reconcile
our differences.

1878
01:27:20.448 --> 01:27:21.658
There it is.

1879
01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.577
Every last one of
those people out there--

1880
01:27:24.619 --> 01:27:27.038
we were there for them.

1881
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.707
We helped them.

1882
01:27:28.748 --> 01:27:32.836
We spiritually nurtured them
and guided them to Christ.

1883
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.299
Now they want us to fail.

1884
01:27:40.135 --> 01:27:43.054
They want us to fail.

1885
01:27:43.096 --> 01:27:45.015
Can you believe that?

1886
01:27:48.893 --> 01:27:50.645
You can.

1887
01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:53.898
Sure. you can.

1888
01:27:55.358 --> 01:27:58.653
Don't think for one moment

1889
01:27:58.695 --> 01:28:00.613
that I haven't known
what you were up to

1890
01:28:00.655 --> 01:28:04.409
from the second that you
stepped foot in this church.

1891
01:28:05.535 --> 01:28:08.371
You came to show
the big bad wolves

1892
01:28:08.413 --> 01:28:10.040
who eat up
all the little piggies.

1893
01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:11.416
Well. guess what.

1894
01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:13.877
Those are not little piggies
out there!

1895
01:28:13.918 --> 01:28:15.628
I am!

1896
01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:18.673
Right here! I am the victim!

1897
01:28:21.176 --> 01:28:24.012
ANITA:
Why don't you just...

1898
01:28:24.054 --> 01:28:25.638
leave?

1899
01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.974
LEE-CURTIS: Why would you
ask her something like that?

1900
01:28:28.016 --> 01:28:29.309
(Trinitie exhales)

1901
01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:32.479
TRINITIE:
So she speaks. Look at that.

1902
01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.816
You-you broke your little
fly-on-the-wall code. huh?

1903
01:28:36.858 --> 01:28:40.403
What are you even
doing here. Anita? Hmm?

1904
01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:42.614
Why are you even here?

1905
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:48.328
ANITA: I'm just showing
this city and this culture.

1906
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:52.749
I want to understand
you and Lee-Curtis. and...

1907
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:56.586
...I want to understand
the truth.

1908
01:28:58.046 --> 01:28:59.589
Yeah?

1909
01:28:59.631 --> 01:29:04.386
Well. that is bullshit
if I have ever heard it.

1910
01:29:06.513 --> 01:29:11.059
"Why don't you just leave?"
Blah. blah. blah.

1911
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:13.687
Is that it? Come on. girl.
Is that all you got?

1912
01:29:13.728 --> 01:29:16.815
Because those kinds of questions

1913
01:29:16.856 --> 01:29:18.692
are not gonna get you
to any real truth.

1914
01:29:18.733 --> 01:29:20.985
Trust me. I have asked them.

1915
01:29:23.738 --> 01:29:25.448
You...

1916
01:29:27.158 --> 01:29:29.411
...and you...

1917
01:29:31.162 --> 01:29:33.415
...and you...

1918
01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:37.877
...and you...

1919
01:29:39.045 --> 01:29:42.173
...and all those folks out
there who are gonna see this...

1920
01:29:43.758 --> 01:29:47.846
...I want them to know that I
did what I was supposed to do.

1921
01:29:47.887 --> 01:29:52.517
I prayed. I knelt.
and I was good.

1922
01:29:58.565 --> 01:30:01.776
So. yes. this is mine.

1923
01:30:02.652 --> 01:30:06.489
This is... this is my church.

1924
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.952
And that is my husband.

1925
01:30:13.913 --> 01:30:17.917
And I would sooner kill him
than leave him.

1926
01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:30.972
(exhales softly)

1927
01:30:38.104 --> 01:30:39.647
(groans)

1928
01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:42.984
(sniffles)

1929
01:30:55.914 --> 01:30:57.624
DESHAWN:
Hey. water. water.

1930
01:30:57.665 --> 01:30:59.125
-BOY: Water.
-Come get your water.

1931
01:30:59.167 --> 01:31:02.128
-Water. Water. Water.
-Water. Water. Water.

1932
01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:03.963
DESHAWN: Ah. come get you some.
I got you.

1933
01:31:04.005 --> 01:31:05.924
-Oh. yeah.
-Appreciate it.

1934
01:31:05.965 --> 01:31:08.385
We used to sell
right next to that big church.

1935
01:31:08.426 --> 01:31:09.844
The let-out was prime.

1936
01:31:09.886 --> 01:31:12.347
All them folks hot and thirsty

1937
01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:15.975
after sitting in that
hot-ass sanctuary for hours.

1938
01:31:16.017 --> 01:31:19.229
Dang. they-they opening
back up for real? (chuckles)

1939
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:22.774
Man. that would be
very. very good for business.

1940
01:31:22.816 --> 01:31:24.401
Folks ain't been
out that way in a minute.

1941
01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:25.777
ANITA:
Do you think that they have

1942
01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:28.113
a good chance
at drawing a crowd today?

1943
01:31:28.154 --> 01:31:29.197
Man...

1944
01:31:30.573 --> 01:31:32.951
I-I mean. it's still
a little early. you know.

1945
01:31:34.035 --> 01:31:36.329
LEE-CURTIS:
Look-it here. look-it here.

1946
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.456
-Hello.
-Culpeppers looking sharp.

1947
01:31:38.498 --> 01:31:39.833
It's so good to see...

1948
01:31:39.874 --> 01:31:41.835
LEE-CURTIS:
How many you thinking. baby?

1949
01:31:41.876 --> 01:31:44.713
Well. at least five.
That's for sure.

1950
01:31:44.754 --> 01:31:47.173
Ah. the old reliables
don't count.

1951
01:31:47.215 --> 01:31:51.052
You know. I'm thinking
maybe a smooth 500.

1952
01:31:51.094 --> 01:31:54.389
You know. I don't want to be
overconfident. but. uh...

1953
01:31:54.431 --> 01:31:55.932
DESHAWN:
If I had to go

1954
01:31:55.974 --> 01:31:59.853
based on the word on the street
and my gut...

1955
01:32:02.272 --> 01:32:04.274
(sighs)

1956
01:32:04.315 --> 01:32:05.525
LEE-CURTIS:
Trinitie...

1957
01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.653
...I'm not so sure
the hat is a good idea. baby.

1958
01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:10.030
I'm really not.

1959
01:32:10.071 --> 01:32:11.740
You know. folks are
gonna want to see us

1960
01:32:11.781 --> 01:32:14.367
looking spectacular.
you know. confident.

1961
01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:19.789
And. uh. well. the hat might
hurt us just a little bit.

1962
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:22.959
Trin?

1963
01:32:23.001 --> 01:32:25.712
Please? The last day of
the cameras. you know.

1964
01:32:25.754 --> 01:32:27.964
Final chapter of our book.
Could you...

1965
01:32:28.006 --> 01:32:29.257
Lee-Curtis...

1966
01:32:30.258 --> 01:32:32.552
...there's gonna have to be
a line between

1967
01:32:32.594 --> 01:32:37.182
some things you say to me
and some. like this hat.

1968
01:32:37.223 --> 01:32:42.270
that you keep to yourself
or between you and your God.

1969
01:32:42.312 --> 01:32:43.813
Okay?

1970
01:32:48.568 --> 01:32:52.072
Well. "ah-men" to that. then.

1971
01:32:57.494 --> 01:32:59.412
ANITA: Have you guys discussed
what happened yesterday

1972
01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:02.749
-and how it might affect you...
-Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1973
01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:04.376
No. no. no. no.

1974
01:33:04.417 --> 01:33:07.671
We are moving forward.

1975
01:33:07.712 --> 01:33:09.798
Like I have been saying
from the beginning.

1976
01:33:09.839 --> 01:33:11.841
we are starting over brand-new.

1977
01:33:11.883 --> 01:33:13.385
That's right. baby.

1978
01:33:13.426 --> 01:33:16.179
That is so right. (chuckles)

1979
01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:25.063
Ah.

1980
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:27.607
(Trinitie sighs)

1981
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:29.109
-Trinitie.
-Hmm?

1982
01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:30.652
Look.

1983
01:33:30.694 --> 01:33:32.404
Baby. look. There.

1984
01:33:32.445 --> 01:33:34.114
Right there. You see that?

1985
01:33:34.155 --> 01:33:37.117
-That. uh. Mustang there?
-Hmm.

1986
01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.453
See. I told ya.

1987
01:33:40.495 --> 01:33:41.788
This is what I mean!

1988
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:45.458
This is
the goddamn comeback. baby!

1989
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.378
(gospel music playing faintly)

1990
01:33:50.672 --> 01:33:53.341
SHAKURA:
We just love preaching together.

1991
01:33:54.342 --> 01:33:57.762
I mean. one day.
God just called us to it.

1992
01:33:57.804 --> 01:33:59.264
told us that. as a team.

1993
01:33:59.305 --> 01:34:03.643
we could reach far beyond
our deepest prayers. and...

1994
01:34:03.685 --> 01:34:06.021
(both laugh)

1995
01:34:06.062 --> 01:34:07.605
ANITA: Did you know
Wander to Greater Paths

1996
01:34:07.647 --> 01:34:09.816
was opening back up today?

1997
01:34:09.858 --> 01:34:11.443
SHAKURA:
Uh...

1998
01:34:12.736 --> 01:34:15.030
You know what?
I-I don't think that we knew

1999
01:34:15.071 --> 01:34:18.324
that Wander to Greater Paths
was opening back up today.

2000
01:34:18.366 --> 01:34:21.703
Now. they seem pretty sold
on-on Easter. (chuckles)

2001
01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:24.330
To be honest. we were. too.

2002
01:34:24.372 --> 01:34:25.790
But. um. we prayed on it.

2003
01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:28.668
and-and we came
to the conclusion...

2004
01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.003
KEON:
Mm-hmm.

2005
01:34:30.045 --> 01:34:33.590
...that they needed Easter.
not us.

2006
01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:35.592
So we moved it. (chuckles)

2007
01:34:35.633 --> 01:34:38.345
-If we had known...
-Mm.

2008
01:34:38.386 --> 01:34:40.013
...Lord. we would have never.

2009
01:34:40.055 --> 01:34:43.016
We wish them
nothing but the best

2010
01:34:43.058 --> 01:34:44.809
and pray that they flourish

2011
01:34:44.851 --> 01:34:46.561
-and can keep it together.
-Amen.

2012
01:34:46.603 --> 01:34:47.687
God's got 'em.

2013
01:34:47.729 --> 01:34:49.230
But. uh. just in case

2014
01:34:49.272 --> 01:34:51.900
the devil is too big
of a beast to wrestle

2015
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:53.651
and they ever feel the need
to step back again...

2016
01:34:53.693 --> 01:34:54.986
Heaven's House
will be right there

2017
01:34:55.028 --> 01:34:56.738
-to pick everybody up.
-Mm.

2018
01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.366
-Believe that.
-Amen.

2019
01:35:00.867 --> 01:35:02.243
LEE-CURTIS:
Oh. man.

2020
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:06.581
Whoo! (laughs)

2021
01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:07.707
Mm-hmm.

2022
01:35:07.749 --> 01:35:09.834
They here for me.

2023
01:35:09.876 --> 01:35:12.337
They here for
Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs.

2024
01:35:12.379 --> 01:35:13.380
Yes. they are.

2025
01:35:13.421 --> 01:35:16.591
(laughing)

2026
01:35:16.633 --> 01:35:18.426
Yes. they are.

2027
01:35:19.719 --> 01:35:21.346
* *

2028
01:35:21.388 --> 01:35:23.431
(tires squealing)

2029
01:35:26.935 --> 01:35:29.979
Ah. see. I told you.

2030
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:31.856
This is what I mean.

2031
01:35:31.898 --> 01:35:34.734
This is
the goddamn comeback. baby!

2032
01:35:34.776 --> 01:35:35.902
SHAKURA:
Praise his name!

2033
01:35:35.944 --> 01:35:37.362
KEON:
Thank you. Jesus!

2034
01:35:37.404 --> 01:35:38.822
-SHAKURA: Praise his name!
-KEON: Amen!

2035
01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:40.281
-Praise his name!
-Amen!

2036
01:35:40.323 --> 01:35:43.159
-You are all God's!
-(congregation cheering)

2037
01:35:43.201 --> 01:35:44.828
Hallelujah!

2038
01:35:44.869 --> 01:35:47.914
Praise his name!
We thank you. God!

2039
01:35:47.956 --> 01:35:49.332
KEON:
Amen!

2040
01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:52.544
-SHAKURA: We worship you. God!
-Amen! Amen.

2041
01:35:53.294 --> 01:35:54.129
Glory be to him.

2042
01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:56.006
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

2043
01:36:00.135 --> 01:36:01.845
* *

2044
01:36:01.886 --> 01:36:04.264
LEE-CURTIS:
Mm-hmm.

2045
01:36:04.305 --> 01:36:06.307
They here for me.
Yes. they are.

2046
01:36:06.349 --> 01:36:09.769
They here for
Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs.

2047
01:36:09.811 --> 01:36:12.105
(laughs)

2048
01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:13.940
Ah.

2049
01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:16.109
Yes. they are.

2050
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:17.902
Yeah.

2051
01:36:19.487 --> 01:36:20.864
They here for me.

2052
01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:22.615
(singers clapping rhythmically.
vocalizing)

2053
01:36:22.657 --> 01:36:24.701
They here for these blessings.

2054
01:36:24.743 --> 01:36:26.786
And I'm gon' give it to 'em.

2055
01:36:26.828 --> 01:36:28.621
We gon' give it to 'em.

2056
01:36:28.663 --> 01:36:30.540
Mm-hmm. You and me. baby.

2057
01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:31.791
And the Lord.

2058
01:36:31.833 --> 01:36:33.626
Ain't that right?

2059
01:36:33.668 --> 01:36:35.337
Trin.

2060
01:36:35.378 --> 01:36:36.629
Baby.
