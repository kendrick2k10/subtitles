00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.793
I have a degree
in criminal justice.

4
00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.196
and a First from Oxford

5
00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:37.498
learning to track and target
a dispersed enemy

6
00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:38.732
<i>in an asymmetrical war.</i>

7
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.135
<i>All this technology.</i>

8
00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.272
and we're back
to 1980s cloak and dagger.

9
00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:45.606
<i>If your
country lost a billion dollars</i>

10
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:46.907
in a cyber-attack.

11
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.211
you'd look to the old ways too.

12
00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.214
<i>While you were living
in a shipping container</i>

13
00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:57.218
<i>in a fortified compound.
learning to turn Afghans.</i>

14
00:01:57.218 --> 00:02:02.923
our old adversaries were...
perfecting their craft.

15
00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.495
Oh. speaking
of old adversaries.

16
00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:09.863
here's your man. Evgeny.

17
00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.032
Followed by Simon
and Garfunkel.

18
00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:13.834
<i>They're here for the handoff.</i>

19
00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:16.904
<i>That means
we don't have much time.</i>

20
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.473
The mole is here.

21
00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.343
or very close.

22
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.423
That's a positive ID
on Abel Zacharia.

23
00:02:35.423 --> 00:02:36.657
Turkish Intelligence.

24
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.292
He contacted
the US State Department

25
00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:41.962
about selling information.
and they turned him down.

26
00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.597
<i>So he went
to the next highest bidder.</i>

27
00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:45.499
<i>There he is. got him.</i>

28
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.735
Opening up the channel.

29
00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.170
<i>Grey trench coat. glasses.</i>

30
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.472
<i>Northwest gate.</i>

31
00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.675
That's your cue. Eugene.

32
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:57.878
<i>National security depends
on us intercepting that intel.</i>

33
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.458
Looking good. sweetheart.

34
00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:15.796
We're in business.

35
00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:17.197
<i>Evgeny's taken the bait.</i>

36
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.133
Stay! Stop!

37
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.084
<i>First contact spotted.</i>

38
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.519
<i>Keep that on Evgeny.</i>

39
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.499
Hey!

40
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.443
<i>And that ladies and gentlemen.</i>

41
00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:04.612
is how you sabotage
an old-school side-drop.

42
00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:15.989
Evgeny.

43
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.272
If you worked for me.

44
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.274
things would be easier.

45
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.044
I'll consider it.

46
00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.549
So...

47
00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:45.553
Today. you have
wedding anniversary. yes?

48
00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:48.556
Hacking my phone?

49
00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:52.393
Your wife.

50
00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:55.596
she will be disappointed
if you are late again.

51
00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:58.532
My wife is never disappointed.

52
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.301
My wife.

53
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.936
she had left me

54
00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:05.272
because of work.

55
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.811
Long career.
many regrets.

56
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.246
but if I could change
one thing.

57
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.783
that would be it.

58
00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:22.322
<i>Nazdrovia.</i> Ben.

59
00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:29.262
Hey. Branca?

60
00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.365
<i>Enjoy the anniversary dinner. boss.</i>

61
00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:33.300
I'll clean up any loose ends.

62
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:35.669
Good job.

63
00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:42.109
Oh. a rose. please.

64
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:44.612
Yes.

65
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:00.894
Good evening. Norbi.

66
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.295
<i>Bonsoir.</i> Ben.

67
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.864
- My wife is...
- Just over there.

68
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.399
- Oh. thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

69
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.540
- Sweetheart.
- You're late. darling.

70
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.207
You know how much
this means to me.

71
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.144
You're lucky that I do.

72
00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.214
Thank you.

73
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.084
So we don't have time
for drinks anymore.

74
00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.386
our table's booked for eight
at The Carlton.

75
00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:31.158
- Well. I'll call a cab then.
- Okay.

76
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.262
Oh. I really want to
say goodbye to Matt.

77
00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.431
- is that all right?
- Okay.

78
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.866
Have I told you
how beautiful you look?

79
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.502
You're not so bad yourself.

80
00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.504
Mr. Malloy.

81
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.941
- Norbi?
- Yes. Ben?

82
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.743
Will you please call us a taxi?

83
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.145
Of course.
Are you leaving so soon?

84
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.914
Yes. anniversary obligations.

85
00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:56.383
Congratulations.

86
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:19.607
Ah...

87
00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:21.942
Farrah...

88
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.478
Farrah!

89
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.280
Excuse me?

90
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.697
Hey man. You good?

91
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.035
- Yeah. I'm... I'm good.
- Okay.

92
00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:31.171
Thank you.

93
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.036
<i>Hey. this is Nick.</i>

94
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.672
<i>I'm backpacking through Europe
right now.</i>

95
00:10:04.672 --> 00:10:06.139
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

96
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:08.441
<i>Don't be jealous.</i>

97
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.644
Hey Nick.
it's. uh. it's your dad.

98
00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:11.745
Just. um...

99
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.617
I'm just calling to say hi.

100
00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:53.887
Nick?

101
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.655
Your father called.

102
00:10:58.792 --> 00:10:59.793
Does he know his son

103
00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:01.394
has landed
such a fantastic job?

104
00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.164
I'm in IT.

105
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.067
My dad wouldn't understand
the appeal.

106
00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.837
You are going to have
to speak with him. eventually.

107
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:10.938
How can I speak with a guy

108
00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:12.205
who doesn't want to talk
about anything?

109
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.208
Well. men are like that.

110
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.711
Even me?

111
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.512
Even you.

112
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.892
Oh. babe.

113
00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:34.694
When'd you find the time?

114
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.531
Every woman has her secrets.

115
00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.170
Is that a good thing?

116
00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:47.207
That depends.

117
00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.381
Oh.

118
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.083
Oh. wow.

119
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.668
<i>We're all very sorry</i>

120
00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:50.303
<i>about the circumstances
of your wife's death.</i>

121
00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:52.873
<i>But there are concerns
related to her last assignment</i>

122
00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:54.441
<i>that we need to address.</i>

123
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:57.010
This is fucking
shooter-arm bullshit.

124
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.311
I've been sitting here
for two hours

125
00:12:58.311 --> 00:12:59.712
answering
the same damn question.

126
00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.882
We're simply exploring
the scope of your knowledge

127
00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.050
of that operation. Mr. Malloy.

128
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.152
I told you what I know.

129
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:08.421
Farrah wouldn't have been
a part of any conspiracy.

130
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.495
Do you recognize
that individual?

131
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.304
- No.
- Kharon Taramov.

132
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.974
He's linked to the murder
of several NATO agents.

133
00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.909
His trade
is information-gathering.

134
00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:30.343
The old-fashioned way.

135
00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:32.379
Russia has spent
the past several years

136
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.548
using men like that
to slowly rebuild its empire.

137
00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.817
quietly undermining
Western democracy.

138
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.986
Okay.

139
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.189
What does he have to do
with Farrah?

140
00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.325
Was your wife his handler?

141
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.160
- Objection.
- Hold on. Ted.

142
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.162
Listen to me
you smug piece of shit.

143
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.931
Farrah believed
what she did for the CIA

144
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.934
was both meaningful and
critical to America's safety.

145
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.405
Beyond that.
we both knew better

146
00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:01.074
than to ask
about each other's work.

147
00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.842
Would you be willing
to take a polygraph exam?

148
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.878
Objection. Ben. That's enough!

149
00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.279
You're damn right I would.

150
00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.714
Ben. we're done!

151
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.049
Go get it.

152
00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.260
Farrah wasn't responsible for
handling any Russians. Ted.

153
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.561
- They're fishing.
- They're smearing her!

154
00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.165
Ben! Hold up.

155
00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.902
How come you're not working
on your handicap?

156
00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:31.804
The Inspector General
keeps interrupting my game.

157
00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.207
Ah. IGs are like mushrooms.

158
00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:36.910
Keep 'em in the dark
and feed 'em manure.

159
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:41.081
I know what's going on

160
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.150
and I've got your back. Ben.

161
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.884
Just telling them everything
I know. sir.

162
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.954
Hm. Oh. I. uh...

163
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:50.657
I hear your son is starting
in. uh. IT. yeah?

164
00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.725
- In the fall? Hm.
- Yes. sir.

165
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:53.927
Well maybe he'll follow

166
00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.695
in his parents' footsteps
one day.

167
00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.865
No loose ends. Ben.

168
00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.173
You heard Williams.

169
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.575
The Agency's backing me.

170
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.743
Deputy Director Williams
is behind a steering wheel

171
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.079
that isn't connected
to an engine.

172
00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:13.913
What does that mean?

173
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.349
Come on. Ben.

174
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:18.151
You've been around long enough.

175
00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.452
The IG's the one
that determines

176
00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.288
whether this gets sent
to the DOJ.

177
00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.256
What's to refer?
Farrah wasn't a double-agent.

178
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.959
We've both been doing this
a long time.

179
00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:27.927
Long enough to understand

180
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.296
the human condition
is not absolute.

181
00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:31.464
We're all inscrutable. Ben.

182
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.166
Even Farrah.

183
00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.068
No. Farrah was clean
as a whistle.

184
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.305
I lived with her.
I raised my son with her.

185
00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:39.406
I know that.

186
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:43.910
So should I cancel my trip?

187
00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.780
Do I need to stay and fight?

188
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.881
Unless you get
some new evidence.

189
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:49.983
there's not much we can do.

190
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.153
It's in the wind now.

191
00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:34.494
I don't buy it.

192
00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.663
Talk to me. Farrah.

193
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.522
Morning. George.

194
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.457
Good morning. Mr. Malloy.

195
00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:05.958
Working hard to keep us safe?

196
00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.128
Yeah.

197
00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:10.263
What... My card doesn't work.

198
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:14.601
Whoa! Ben Malloy.
good to see you. man.

199
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:16.269
How you doing man?
You looking good.

200
00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.870
Come on. man.

201
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.472
Do I know you?

202
00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:22.475
What? Come on. it's me.
you don't recognize me?

203
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.077
- No.
- Oh. you want VIP access.

204
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:25.145
but they've put
a security restriction

205
00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.313
on your badge.

206
00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:27.914
How do you know that?

207
00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:29.149
Desmond Jackson.

208
00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:31.684
Although anybody who's anyone
calls me Dez.

209
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.753
Come on. man.
you know that.

210
00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:34.987
We got it. George.

211
00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.656
We're good. we're good.
we're good. You...

212
00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:37.757
Follow me fast.
if you hesitate.

213
00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:38.891
I will leave you.

214
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.933
So. we are the foremost
information acquisitionists

215
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:48.168
in the world.

216
00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:49.969
Here. and I think we can help.

217
00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.238
But I can only imagine

218
00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:52.572
what you're going through.
Mr. Malloy.

219
00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:54.507
How do you know my name?

220
00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:55.942
And why the personal escort?

221
00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.777
You were the Chief of Station
for the Baltics.

222
00:17:57.777 --> 00:17:59.812
I am really sorry about
what happened. by the way.

223
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.949
- Who restricted my access?
- Anytime the IG investigates

224
00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.517
they're gonna clip your wings.

225
00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:06.786
I mean. we can sweep
your system for bugs.

226
00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.655
it won't do much
but it'd give you an edge.

227
00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.357
I'm not under
formal investigation.

228
00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:11.824
Hey. look.

229
00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:12.792
Mr. Malloy. I'm no lawyer

230
00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.661
but if the IG decides
to drop a bomb.

231
00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:15.862
you're in the blast radius.

232
00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.268
I need help.

233
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.936
Did you know Farrah?

234
00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.938
Why do you think
I'm helping you?

235
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.307
She was one
of the very best people

236
00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:28.608
I've ever worked for.

237
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.943
And your son is something else
in the IT field.

238
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.445
- You should be proud.
- I am.

239
00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:36.649
Hey. You don't need to
hold my hand. I can do this.

240
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.154
So you're familiar with
running the latest modular

241
00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.889
mission applications
to provide. amongst others.

242
00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:45.325
total CREST access
and SIGINT functionality?

243
00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:47.627
Please.

244
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.095
No. please.

245
00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:52.765
I need you to hold my hand.

246
00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:01.708
Okay. so.
I'm running a broad sweep

247
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:04.677
on any questionables operating
in and around the area

248
00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:06.446
where your wife was killed.

249
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.317
Know what a sociogram is?

250
00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:13.286
Yeah. it's a visual tool
for charting

251
00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.787
relationships within groups.

252
00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.589
This ain't your first rodeo.

253
00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.593
All right. so we have got

254
00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.396
rainbow coalition
of white and black hats.

255
00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:25.198
Hungarian TEK.

256
00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:27.534
Polish SKW intel.

257
00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.602
a former Chechen Kadyrovite.

258
00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:31.838
hell. we even got ourselves
some former members

259
00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.139
of the Estonian KAPO.

260
00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:35.275
Huh.

261
00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:46.386
There is one other person

262
00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:48.087
who was around
on the day Farrah died.

263
00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:50.890
Kharon Taramov.

264
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.559
Any idea what
he was doing in Hungary?

265
00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.193
- No.
- Hm.

266
00:19:57.664 --> 00:19:59.065
You ever considered
the Russians?

267
00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:03.035
I mean. FSB. GRU
ain't a bunch of Boy Scouts.

268
00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.437
No. I know the Baltic chief.

269
00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:05.872
Evgeny Kalinakov?

270
00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:06.973
Yeah.
that's not his thing.

271
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.842
Killing people is not
his thing?

272
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.478
I didn't say that.

273
00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:14.281
Okay.

274
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.583
I'll run a remote
scan from your laptop.

275
00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:19.686
Give me a few days and
we'll see who's been snooping.

276
00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:05.598
Did they force you
to do this?

277
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:08.601
Tell me you weren't involved.

278
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.975
"Connect the dots..."

279
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.284
Huh.

280
00:21:27.053 --> 00:21:28.321
Nick.

281
00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:30.523
- <i>Hey. dad.</i>
- I'd begin to worry about you.

282
00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:31.824
Yeah.

283
00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:34.160
Yeah. reception's been shitty
out here.

284
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.696
Yeah. those French cell-towers
get you every time.

285
00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:39.131
<i>Actually.
I'm... I'm not in France.</i>

286
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.334
What do you mean
you're not in France?

287
00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:44.704
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm. uh... I'm in Croatia.</i>

288
00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:47.840
Croatia?
What are you doing there?

289
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.376
Yeah. there's this girl.

290
00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:50.577
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

291
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.613
<i>Yup. there always is.</i>

292
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.715
Her name's Veronique.

293
00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:57.016
<i>Right.</i>

294
00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:59.318
She's chill. You'll like her.

295
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.220
Oh. I'm sure I will.

296
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.689
<i>Yeah. look. I'm running
a little late right now.</i>

297
00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:04.357
Do you think we could meet

298
00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:06.693
- Thursday?
- On Thursday?

299
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.428
- I land on Monday.
- <i>I know.</i>

300
00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:09.729
What am I going to do
for four days?

301
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:11.398
Look. please don't be pissed.

302
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:14.033
No. I'm not. I mean.
you're a grown man.

303
00:22:14.033 --> 00:22:15.502
you can make
your own decisions.

304
00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:18.605
I just want to see you.
that's all.

305
00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:20.607
We'll still meet up in France. okay?

306
00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:22.341
<i>I can kill a couple...</i>

307
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.443
I said we'll still
meet up in...

308
00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:25.445
Nick?

309
00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:27.814
Nick!

310
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:29.849
Dad?

311
00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:34.787
I love you. kid.

312
00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:37.690
Don't get her pregnant.

313
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.958
Okay.

314
00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:41.293
I'm proud of you.

315
00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.596
<i>- Mon cheri.
- Yeah.</i>

316
00:22:50.603 --> 00:22:51.638
You're in Croatia?

317
00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:53.673
I'll go to Budapest.

318
00:22:54.807 --> 00:22:55.975
Kill a couple of days.

319
00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:22.068
You shouldn't be out here
without a coat.

320
00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:27.239
I don't need a coat.
when I have you.

321
00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:33.145
<i>Mademoiselle. monsieur.</i>

322
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.582
Come on.

323
00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:45.324
<i>Merci.</i>

324
00:23:45.324 --> 00:23:46.425
You look great.

325
00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:48.260
Thank you.

326
00:23:56.035 --> 00:23:57.069
<i>Merci.</i>

327
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.513
What secrets
are darkening your brow?

328
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:10.416
You know better than
to ask me that.

329
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.255
I'm probably just thinking
about how lucky I am.

330
00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:21.661
Do you ever give that
intuition of yours a rest?

331
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:23.996
Hm...

332
00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:28.400
No. Especially around you.

333
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:31.604
Speaking of. uh. intuition.

334
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:34.641
what are you hiding?

335
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:36.843
Remember.

336
00:24:38.044 --> 00:24:39.478
when we were "discovered"?

337
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:42.348
Hm. yeah. Like two little kids
caught necking?

338
00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:45.017
They said
it would never work.

339
00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:47.787
A husband and a wife.

340
00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:51.658
You did. didn't you?

341
00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:57.864
- You did it? Well. hello.
- Mm-hm.

342
00:24:59.398 --> 00:25:00.600
Mrs. Chief of Station.

343
00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.038
That little Algerian girl

344
00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.040
got smart.

345
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.442
With the support
of a wonderful husband...

346
00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.444
- Hey.
- ...a loving son and

347
00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.046
- a bit of luck maybe?
- Yeah.

348
00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:15.682
Now she deserves to celebrate.

349
00:25:16.749 --> 00:25:18.050
On that note...

350
00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:30.096
My grandfather bought these
as a gift for my grandmother

351
00:25:30.096 --> 00:25:31.363
when they were married.

352
00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:33.633
Open it.

353
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:42.074
Named after Fatima.
beloved daughter of Muhammad.

354
00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:45.044
They're for protection
and good fortune.

355
00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:51.550
I want you to keep it close
to your heart. Ben.

356
00:25:52.652 --> 00:25:55.087
That way I will always
be there with you.

357
00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:07.934
I'll never take
it off.

358
00:26:09.235 --> 00:26:11.037
Keep it right next
to my heart.

359
00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:14.573
I love you. Ben.

360
00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:17.076
I love you. Farrah.

361
00:27:34.954 --> 00:27:36.088
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

362
00:27:37.423 --> 00:27:39.425
You're the one on DC time.

363
00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:41.761
What would you say if I told
you I was in town?

364
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:43.763
<i>I would say remember
the restaurant on Gundel?</i>

365
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.464
Great coffee.

366
00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:48.500
Nine a.m.

367
00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:06.185
Look at you.

368
00:28:07.987 --> 00:28:09.789
You went from body armor
to bespoke.

369
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:11.724
Well. the new Chief
has to look good.

370
00:28:11.724 --> 00:28:13.159
You deserve
every bit of it.

371
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.968
How's Nick? I hear
he's landed a great job.

372
00:28:21.968 --> 00:28:24.737
Seems everybody's heard that.

373
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:29.375
Oh. wow. Last time I saw him.
he was this high.

374
00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:31.778
Please congratulate him
for me.

375
00:28:31.778 --> 00:28:34.814
I will.
We're meeting in Paris.

376
00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.382
That's the layover?

377
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:37.850
Yes.

378
00:28:38.517 --> 00:28:40.152
Had a few days and. um.

379
00:28:40.152 --> 00:28:41.754
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

380
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:47.059
Thank you.

381
00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.160
You're welcome.

382
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.010
You were saying?

383
00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:07.179
There've been some. um...

384
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:11.250
things. that I want
to talk to you about.

385
00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:15.487
We both know that
the IG report is utter shit.

386
00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.622
but I can't discuss any...

387
00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:18.757
They're trying
to blame Farrah.

388
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.459
Blame her for the death
of those agents.

389
00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:22.361
Right.

390
00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:24.463
That's. uh.
a slap in the face.

391
00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:25.597
Yeah.

392
00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:31.537
What if her death
wasn't an accident?

393
00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:33.372
Do you know something I don't?

394
00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:37.543
No.

395
00:29:37.543 --> 00:29:39.211
It's a feeling. a hunch.

396
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.115
I do hate when you get those.

397
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:46.385
John. what if everything
we know about Farrah's death.

398
00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:48.320
is wrong?

399
00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:53.625
- Any evidence?
- Not conclusive.

400
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.728
John. I just feel like. um...

401
00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.330
I feel like we need to do...

402
00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:01.567
something.

403
00:30:01.567 --> 00:30:03.569
Well. we are not
going to do anything.

404
00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:06.906
You're going to Paris and...

405
00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:11.177
I'll shake a few branches.
see what falls out the tree.

406
00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:15.614
But. uh...

407
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.486
I think it's important
you spend time with your son.

408
00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:25.791
Thanks. John.

409
00:31:29.488 --> 00:31:30.522
Farrah!

410
00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:02.821
Hello. sir.
how can I help you?

411
00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:04.523
I'm just looking. thank you.

412
00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:07.093
I'm afraid we're
by appointment only. sir.

413
00:32:07.994 --> 00:32:09.861
I need to see Hitchens.

414
00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:11.563
There's no one here
with that name.

415
00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:15.434
Tell him Jedburgh is here.

416
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.049
Mm-hmm.

417
00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:34.953
Follow me.

418
00:32:43.062 --> 00:32:44.796
No. I'll get back to you
on that one.

419
00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:48.300
Okay. I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

420
00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:54.506
- Benjamin.
- Hello. Hitch.

421
00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:56.475
- Could have called.
- Would you have answered?

422
00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:57.909
No.

423
00:32:57.909 --> 00:33:00.646
But it would have given me
time to run and hide.

424
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:03.749
I supplied you
as an operative. but this...

425
00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:05.317
I could lose my job
helping you.

426
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.918
I've got nowhere else to go.

427
00:33:08.254 --> 00:33:09.321
Besides.

428
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.690
you knew Farrah as well
as anyone.

429
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.193
You never really know anyone
in this trade. Ben.

430
00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.236
When Farrah died.

431
00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:27.005
she was wearing
a replacement wedding ring.

432
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.175
Nanotechnology.

433
00:33:29.175 --> 00:33:32.111
Test case item
that never went into issue.

434
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:34.380
I was looking
after her original.

435
00:33:38.084 --> 00:33:40.086
We believe Evgeny's
tech-team hacked it

436
00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:42.588
and were able
to track Farrah's movements.

437
00:33:42.588 --> 00:33:44.356
So the explosion
that killed Farrah.

438
00:33:45.091 --> 00:33:46.225
they knew she'd be there?

439
00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.027
Evgeny was sidelined.

440
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.563
He was officially
suspended from operations.

441
00:33:51.563 --> 00:33:54.966
Though he still holds court
at the El Royale Casino.

442
00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:57.369
You keep it.

443
00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:01.873
When this is over.
I'll be back.

444
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:04.810
I hope so.

445
00:34:07.613 --> 00:34:10.048
I don't believe Farrah's death
was an accident.

446
00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:13.752
There's a reason why
the clandestine world

447
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:16.588
is described
as a wilderness of mirrors.

448
00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:17.989
I can do one thing for you.

449
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.593
This is
Farrah's emergency fund.

450
00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:26.265
It's the most useful thing
I can give you.

451
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:29.701
Parting gift in her memory.

452
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:34.206
Use it to find Evgeny.

453
00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.048
Evgeny's cold.

454
00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:45.351
He wants to stay cold.

455
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:47.819
If you want his focus.
make a scene.

456
00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.888
You remember how to do that.

457
00:34:50.656 --> 00:34:52.057
Don't you. Ben?

458
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:17.649
- <i>Mr. M.</i>
- How did you get this number?

459
00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:19.218
<i>Scanned your laptop.</i>

460
00:35:19.218 --> 00:35:20.986
And what's the diagnosis?

461
00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:23.021
<i>That thing is more infected</i>

462
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.224
than a botnet at a denial
of service convention.

463
00:35:25.224 --> 00:35:27.526
- It's crazy.
- What does that mean?

464
00:35:27.526 --> 00:35:29.895
<i>So. whoever did this
is sophisticated.</i>

465
00:35:29.895 --> 00:35:30.962
<i>so watch your ass.</i>

466
00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:32.831
I'm gonna trash your laptop.

467
00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.502
Do it.

468
00:35:36.502 --> 00:35:42.408
<i>♪ Something in my vein</i>

469
00:35:42.408 --> 00:35:46.345
<i>♪ Take back the words
They say</i>

470
00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:52.651
<i>♪ You would never let go</i>

471
00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:59.391
<i>♪ Hear the words with ease ♪</i>

472
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:22.514
<i>♪ Maybe it never happened ♪</i>

473
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:36.228
They said you had retired.

474
00:36:36.228 --> 00:36:37.963
They said the same about you.

475
00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:40.131
No. I am what you call...

476
00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:41.867
slow quitting.

477
00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:45.070
How did you get in?

478
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.738
I gave Vadim
a two million ruble bribe

479
00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:47.839
at the door.

480
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.309
You know. I slipped him a $50.

481
00:36:51.009 --> 00:36:52.578
Oh. so you have cash.

482
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.815
Is there any objection

483
00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:59.685
if I raise minimum stake
to. uh...

484
00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:02.754
$5.000 US Dollars?

485
00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:04.590
Let's make it $10.000.

486
00:37:41.927 --> 00:37:43.061
Unlucky.

487
00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:47.699
As I think will be your
Inspector General's report

488
00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:48.800
when it's released.

489
00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:53.872
I have some questions...

490
00:37:54.906 --> 00:37:55.941
about my wife.

491
00:37:57.443 --> 00:37:59.110
America.

492
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.382
always. she is blaming
other people for her problems.

493
00:38:03.382 --> 00:38:05.083
When she should be looking
in mirror.

494
00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:15.126
The world has changed. Ben.

495
00:38:17.262 --> 00:38:19.398
We are enemies once more.

496
00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:27.072
We've never stopped
being enemies.

497
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:32.544
Means "stomach
is ungrateful wench.

498
00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:36.648
"never remembers past favors.
always wanting more."

499
00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.351
You should leave. Ben.

500
00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:42.621
Odds always favor the house.

501
00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.292
That was foolish. Evgeny.

502
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.384
Hey!

503
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:41.780
Why? Why you do this?

504
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.116
- I want answers.
- And I had winning hand.

505
00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.718
What do you know about
Farrah's death?

506
00:39:48.454 --> 00:39:50.188
I'll bring you in from
the cold. Evgeny.

507
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:55.160
I'll burn you.
and then I'll bury you.

508
00:39:57.295 --> 00:39:59.164
You have let heart...

509
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.700
overrule common sense.

510
00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:05.871
It's very disappointing.

511
00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.307
You sure you don't want me
to come?

512
00:40:09.307 --> 00:40:10.942
I'll be about an hour.

513
00:40:10.942 --> 00:40:14.112
Groceries. water. wine.

514
00:40:14.112 --> 00:40:16.615
I enjoy shopping.

515
00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:17.949
You have to work.

516
00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.518
I do. I do.

517
00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:21.720
And you do. so we're good.

518
00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:25.090
Thank you for the coffee.
my love.

519
00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:29.528
Okay.

520
00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:32.397
No.

521
00:40:33.198 --> 00:40:34.232
Bye. Nick.

522
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.201
See you in an hour?

523
00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:37.969
- Love you.
- Love you. I love you.

524
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:21.680
I knew you'd be back.

525
00:41:35.393 --> 00:41:36.628
Nicholas Malloy?

526
00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:40.298
My name is Jansson.

527
00:41:41.767 --> 00:41:43.034
I need you to come with me.

528
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.371
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

529
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.273
My girlfriend just left. she's
gonna be back in a second.

530
00:41:48.273 --> 00:41:50.576
We'll send a secure escort
for her.

531
00:41:50.576 --> 00:41:52.243
We're protecting her from
the same foreign nationals

532
00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.511
that's been tracking you.

533
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.446
This has something to do
with my dad. doesn't it?

534
00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.515
I'm not at liberty
to discuss the situation.

535
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.985
But we have to go.

536
00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:03.421
What if I refuse?

537
00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:04.856
I wouldn't
suggest that. sir.

538
00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:38.724
- You have ruined my evening.
- Fuck you.

539
00:42:39.658 --> 00:42:40.892
You've ruined my life.

540
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.762
Ben. this is not like you.

541
00:42:43.762 --> 00:42:45.296
I know it was you.

542
00:42:46.832 --> 00:42:49.300
Oh and that is what
you have come here to do. hm?

543
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.769
To avenge Farrah?

544
00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:51.903
<i>Nyet. nyet.</i>

545
00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:54.740
Why... Why...
Why you come here?

546
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.775
You are too experienced

547
00:42:56.775 --> 00:42:58.576
to start conflict
without provocation.

548
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.279
You are not on assignment.

549
00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:03.114
No one would let you
operate like this.

550
00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:04.582
No. no.

551
00:43:05.984 --> 00:43:08.920
You have come to clear
her name. haven't you?

552
00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.364
Hey.

553
00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:33.378
I know it was you Evgeny.

554
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.882
I know about the other assets.
the accidents.

555
00:43:36.882 --> 00:43:38.149
I know you killed them all.

556
00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:40.118
Ben. Ben. Ben...

557
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:46.825
We have walked the same path
for decades.

558
00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:50.328
we do same operations
for opposite sides of camp.

559
00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:51.462
We are different

560
00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.865
but. on this point.

561
00:43:53.865 --> 00:43:56.634
you could not be more wrong.

562
00:44:02.708 --> 00:44:05.844
This... These are who
you're talking about?

563
00:44:05.844 --> 00:44:08.079
Half-dozen active agents

564
00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:10.148
killed in the last few months. yes?

565
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.350
Yeah. with your signature
all over it.

566
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.551
We have footage.

567
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:16.021
Was damaged.
We clean up a few frames.

568
00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:29.434
Former FSB.

569
00:44:29.434 --> 00:44:30.501
Your guy.

570
00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:33.171
Gonna admit it. Evgeny?

571
00:44:33.939 --> 00:44:34.973
Say it.

572
00:44:35.907 --> 00:44:36.942
No.

573
00:44:37.843 --> 00:44:39.544
I swear on mother's grave.

574
00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:42.680
He does not work for us.

575
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.115
Then who is responsible?

576
00:44:48.987 --> 00:44:52.257
You remember when you were
stationed in Macedonia. yes?

577
00:44:52.257 --> 00:44:53.892
Yes. I'd like to forget.

578
00:44:53.892 --> 00:44:55.626
Well. then you will recall

579
00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:59.397
how Alexander the Great
came to power of throne.

580
00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:01.299
His father. Philip.
was killed.

581
00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:02.868
murdered. double-crossed.

582
00:45:02.868 --> 00:45:04.736
by best friend.

583
00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:14.312
Evgeny. Evgeny!

584
00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:17.648
Go. Ben! Get out!

585
00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:03.494
Branca!
It's Ben. listen to me.

586
00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:10.101
Triangulate this call

587
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.369
and get here
as soon as you can.

588
00:46:12.904 --> 00:46:14.239
Come on!

589
00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:01.786
That's enough!

590
00:47:10.128 --> 00:47:11.429
How'd you
get here so fast?

591
00:47:26.978 --> 00:47:29.247
You are one lucky sod. Ben.

592
00:47:29.247 --> 00:47:31.349
An FSB kill-team rarely fails.

593
00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:33.084
I know.

594
00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:38.089
How'd you get here
so quickly. John?

595
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:40.158
We were tracking Evgeny.

596
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:46.731
Farrah was murdered.

597
00:47:46.731 --> 00:47:49.300
I know it now. We were set up.

598
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.569
- By who?
- I don't know.

599
00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:53.538
Thought it was the Russians.
but I'm not so sure anymore.

600
00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:56.307
Well you know
you can't trust him.

601
00:47:56.307 --> 00:47:57.408
He's old-school.

602
00:47:58.143 --> 00:48:00.211
Just like you. Ben.

603
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.812
I think it's best you lay low.

604
00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:03.581
I'll take you
to a secure location.

605
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.925
Can you tell me
what's going on?

606
00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:16.261
I mean. we've been driving
for the last three hours.

607
00:48:16.261 --> 00:48:17.996
Are you gonna tell me
my father's in the care

608
00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:19.097
and custody of Ground Branch?

609
00:48:19.097 --> 00:48:20.398
Like... Like you guys
always do?

610
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.967
Your father talk much about
his work?

611
00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:23.901
Is it Syrians?
Is it the Serbians?

612
00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:26.938
Am I allowed to know?

613
00:48:26.938 --> 00:48:29.440
Well. seeing
that you're family...

614
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.776
There's a rogue element
to the FSB.

615
00:48:31.776 --> 00:48:33.211
They tried to kill
your father.

616
00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:35.380
Not an easy task.

617
00:48:37.682 --> 00:48:38.849
So what do you want with me?

618
00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:40.285
You're next on the list.

619
00:48:40.285 --> 00:48:41.619
Wait. hold...
If I'm next on the list.

620
00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:42.988
what happens to my girlfriend?

621
00:48:42.988 --> 00:48:43.989
- No. no. no. she...
- We just left her behind.

622
00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:45.790
She's fine.

623
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.192
We have someone watching her.

624
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.173
I need a sat phone
to call Nick.

625
00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:04.209
I've already sent a go team
to retrieve him.

626
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:08.479
How?

627
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:12.583
Root access allowed us
to geolocate his phone.

628
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:14.485
I already briefed
Director Williams.

629
00:49:23.061 --> 00:49:24.395
Welcome aboard. Ben.

630
00:49:36.107 --> 00:49:37.142
It's right here.

631
00:49:38.743 --> 00:49:39.844
What is this?

632
00:49:39.844 --> 00:49:41.179
Trust me.

633
00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:42.913
It's better you're here
with us than out there.

634
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:02.633
Okay.

635
00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:31.929
I wanna thank you. John.

636
00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:36.301
I should be the one
thanking you.

637
00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:39.237
Your visit here
outed an operation

638
00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:40.338
we never saw coming.

639
00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:43.474
Apparently the men
who shot Evgeny

640
00:50:43.474 --> 00:50:45.476
were Chechen assassins

641
00:50:45.476 --> 00:50:47.712
associated
with the Wagner Group.

642
00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:48.813
Yeah. but why?

643
00:50:49.747 --> 00:50:51.416
Intel suggests they...

644
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:53.718
were looking for something.

645
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:56.087
Something...

646
00:50:56.821 --> 00:50:57.888
you might have.

647
00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.224
That I might have?

648
00:51:00.825 --> 00:51:02.893
Did Evgeny or the others ever
ask you for anything?

649
00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.263
No. nothing.

650
00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:07.732
John. I went to them.

651
00:51:08.733 --> 00:51:09.934
They never asked you
for anything?

652
00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:11.736
No. I was the one doing
the asking.

653
00:51:18.643 --> 00:51:20.678
Did Farrah give you
something before she died?

654
00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.615
What the hell
would she give me?

655
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:25.716
I don't know. Ben.

656
00:51:27.152 --> 00:51:28.186
You tell me.

657
00:51:34.159 --> 00:51:35.926
No. she didn't give me
anything.

658
00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:41.766
Look. I need to speak to Nick.

659
00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:45.270
There's a satellite phone
downstairs.

660
00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:07.558
My father's not coming. is he?

661
00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:12.062
You want the truth or a lie?

662
00:52:23.374 --> 00:52:24.775
I don't want
to kill you. Nick.

663
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.577
but I will.

664
00:52:50.435 --> 00:52:51.469
Sit down.

665
00:52:58.243 --> 00:52:59.610
Fuckin' amateurs.

666
00:53:12.857 --> 00:53:14.392
It'll never be enough. John.

667
00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:18.563
Whatever they offer you...

668
00:53:20.298 --> 00:53:21.499
never be enough.

669
00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:40.951
Ben. why weren't
you honest with me

670
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.720
when I asked you
if you knew anything?

671
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.258
You're a fuckin' traitor.
John.

672
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:50.361
Eight years
we worked together.

673
00:53:51.696 --> 00:53:53.030
and I trusted you.

674
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.034
I had your back.

675
00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:00.338
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

676
00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:02.840
What did Farrah give you?

677
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.941
She gave me a son.

678
00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:06.010
She gave me a home.

679
00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:09.547
She gave me a life.

680
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:13.584
Leave us.

681
00:54:30.701 --> 00:54:32.202
You know
my history. John.

682
00:54:33.504 --> 00:54:35.205
You know what I'm capable of.

683
00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.042
You should just kill me.

684
00:54:52.557 --> 00:54:54.325
You should watch your back.
John.

685
00:54:54.325 --> 00:54:56.226
I don't really think
that you're in a position

686
00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:57.728
to be making threats.

687
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.438
You know she was. uh...

688
00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:09.974
a honeytrap. right?

689
00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:13.911
She used to fuck the enemy.

690
00:55:15.112 --> 00:55:19.817
That is why Evgeny
felt so sorry for you.

691
00:55:19.817 --> 00:55:22.019
He had empathy.

692
00:55:26.424 --> 00:55:27.458
Am I done?

693
00:55:43.808 --> 00:55:46.143
You always lived
in a dark place. John.

694
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:48.045
No joy.

695
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:49.880
No love.

696
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:07.865
What did Farrah give you?

697
00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:12.069
Hm? What did she give you?

698
00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:40.931
What did Farrah give you?

699
00:56:43.468 --> 00:56:44.502
What did Farrah give you?

700
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.947
John! Fuck you!

701
00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:01.118
What the fuck
did she give you?

702
00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:19.036
They have him
at the safehouse.

703
00:57:30.548 --> 00:57:32.149
Let's see if Nick...

704
00:57:33.217 --> 00:57:34.785
can handle the same pain
as you.

705
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.057
You fuckin' touch him...

706
00:57:42.226 --> 00:57:44.495
I'll kill everything
you love. John.

707
00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.189
You were there.

708
00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:15.626
That was you at the cafe.
wasn't it?

709
00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:23.000
- What's your name?
- Why does it matter?

710
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.703
I like to know the name
of the people I'm gonna kill.

711
00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:32.042
Ah. you Americans think
you are so powerful.

712
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.781
Let me tell you
a little story. my friend.

713
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.249
In the 1980s.

714
00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:42.853
the head of the CIA
was captured by Hezbollah.

715
00:58:44.121 --> 00:58:46.557
Tortured to death.

716
00:58:46.557 --> 00:58:50.160
A few weeks later. the head
of the KGB was captured.

717
00:58:52.196 --> 00:58:57.201
The KGB kidnapped a relative
of the leader of Hezbollah.

718
00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:59.036
And kept sending body parts.

719
00:59:00.705 --> 00:59:01.739
A finger.

720
00:59:02.506 --> 00:59:03.540
a thumb.

721
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:09.747
The head of the KGB
was released unharmed.

722
00:59:18.689 --> 00:59:21.692
You will never beat us.

723
00:59:21.692 --> 00:59:24.061
We're not playing
by the same rule.

724
00:59:57.862 --> 00:59:58.896
You're Krystyna...

725
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.265
Kowerski.

726
01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.171
How do I know
you're not a black hat?

727
01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.640
I don't work with Chechens.
I kill them.

728
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.508
Where's my son?

729
01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:12.609
Hm...

730
01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.614
You're too weak to leave
the way I came.

731
01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:19.950
Listen.

732
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.820
you're gonna have to focus
on what we do next. all right?

733
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.822
There are shooters up there.

734
01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.957
And they're waiting for us.

735
01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.058
- Can you move fast?
- Yeah. let's go.

736
01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.559
- You sure?
- Yeah. let's go.

737
01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.829
Okay. You follow me.

738
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:32.930
- Come on.
- Yeah. go.

739
01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:43.941
Those men up there
are not CIA.

740
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.615
Stay with me.

741
01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:05.730
Get in the Zodiac!

742
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.974
Nice work.

743
01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:01.578
Took your sweet time.

744
01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.148
You had it under control.

745
01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.615
We need to go.

746
01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.826
You've been following me
since I arrived. haven't you?

747
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.529
You were on the motorcycle.

748
01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:54.531
How do I know I can trust you?

749
01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.433
I risked my ass.

750
01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.602
and killed
eight Chechen contractors.

751
01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:01.105
I saved your life back there.

752
01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:03.207
Choose your next accusation
carefully.

753
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.509
Thank you.

754
01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:06.610
It's my pleasure.

755
01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:30.367
- I need to find my son.
- You need to listen.

756
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.403
Your wife gave me
specific instructions.

757
01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.039
Do you have the hand
of Fatima?

758
01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:38.208
The hand of Fatima?

759
01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.409
Yes.

760
01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.712
Yes. I do.

761
01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:46.083
- This?
- Very good.

762
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.718
You have the key.
and I have the address.

763
01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:51.855
If I wasn't wearing it...

764
01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.958
But you are. Ben.

765
01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:55.692
And Farrah told me that.

766
01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.495
The men who took your son

767
01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.230
are the men
who betrayed Farrah.

768
01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.246
Please.

769
01:05:17.814 --> 01:05:19.083
You don't have to do this.

770
01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:22.552
You can let me go.

771
01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.755
It's complicated. Nick.

772
01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:28.858
I'm just following orders.

773
01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.966
How come you haven't
shown yourself until now?

774
01:05:38.835 --> 01:05:39.970
Farrah ran a stable

775
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.272
of deep cover
intelligence assets.

776
01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.540
She was about to expose

777
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.610
a complex money laundering
operation

778
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.012
that linked
the Central Bank of Russia

779
01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:50.814
to a whole host
of NATO countries.

780
01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:53.217
She said the expose would be
like the Panama Papers

781
01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:54.351
on steroids.

782
01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:55.885
Why didn't she tell me?

783
01:05:58.055 --> 01:05:59.889
'Cause she discovered
a rogue US operative

784
01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.992
was at the center of it all.

785
01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.494
One who played all sides
against each other.

786
01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.296
So you were
one of her informants?

787
01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.334
There were seven people
on her asset list.

788
01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.304
I'm the only one still alive.

789
01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.573
You chose to break cover.
for me.

790
01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.075
Why?

791
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.680
I made a promise to your wife.

792
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.116
She was there for me
when I needed her.

793
01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:31.655
With my help.
you can end this.

794
01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:34.291
I promise.

795
01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.204
Branca wants
to talk to you. brother.

796
01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:51.541
I'mma wait outside.

797
01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:13.697
You look like her.

798
01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:18.235
You killed her. didn't you?

799
01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:20.804
Her biggest mistake
was that she trusted me.

800
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.975
I'll kill you.

801
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:28.945
See how easy it is?

802
01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:30.747
We all have it inside of us.

803
01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.350
All we need
is the right motivation.

804
01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:45.395
I promise you.

805
01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.030
you're not going to get away
with it.

806
01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.134
Hm.

807
01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:52.869
What was it that she left
for you and your father?

808
01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:56.072
I don't know.

809
01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:01.111
I actually believe you.

810
01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.414
But it doesn't matter now.

811
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.955
Farrah wanted you
to open this.

812
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.056
Not me.

813
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:52.662
"OA."

814
01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:55.665
<i>Occultis aperta.</i>

815
01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:58.302
"Hidden in plain sight."

816
01:08:58.302 --> 01:09:00.570
Farrah's idea
of a joke.

817
01:09:02.739 --> 01:09:03.773
You have the key.

818
01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.971
You knew her before.

819
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.976
Before Guantanamo.

820
01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.944
the US sent
"high value" detainees

821
01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:17.481
to Poland for interrogation.

822
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.049
Farrah was straight out
of university.

823
01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.651
She spoke fluent Arabic.

824
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.520
we were the only women there.

825
01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.056
We were friends.

826
01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:32.329
Our careers mirrored
each other. you know.

827
01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:34.331
Farrah's with the CIA.

828
01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:36.666
and mine with GROM.

829
01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:42.205
I always had deep respect
for her.

830
01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.577
She never mentioned you.

831
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.847
You never really know a person
in this profession... right?

832
01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:54.117
Mm-hmm.

833
01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:58.187
Your wife
always had wonderful taste.

834
01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:01.958
How long did she know?

835
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.294
Farrah was an excellent judge
of human nature.

836
01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:06.830
I think she would have
suspected

837
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.466
Branca was dirty
for some time.

838
01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:11.034
So she was protecting me.

839
01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.271
But I couldn't protect her.

840
01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.106
Or Nick.

841
01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:20.310
You're doing what needs
to be done right now.

842
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.245
It's all that matters.

843
01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:29.953
Look at this.

844
01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.242
That's a list of money
being funneled

845
01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.980
- through LLCs. cut-outs...
- Agency fronts?

846
01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:58.915
Branca's.

847
01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.350
He appears to be
on the payroll

848
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:03.853
of at least five other
foreign intelligence agencies.

849
01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.689
along with someone else.

850
01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:11.428
Holy shit.

851
01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.229
No...

852
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:16.533
Farrah discovered that the
Deputy Director of the CIA

853
01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.568
is a rogue agent.

854
01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.103
This is what
they're looking for.

855
01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.372
He's running the whole thing.

856
01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.508
Branca's just
a glorified foot soldier...

857
01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:25.642
Mm-hm.

858
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:28.077
- Hm.
- What's that?

859
01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:31.548
I don't know. looks like some
sort of modified BIGOT List.

860
01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:41.458
Maybe
that's a mistake. I mean...

861
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.992
she was a handler. after all.

862
01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.871
Oh. Farrah. Farrah.

863
01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:00.209
She wanted you to see this.

864
01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.811
She was working with them
the whole time.

865
01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:04.180
You don't know that Ben.
I mean did she...

866
01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.571
John. It's Ben.

867
01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.340
I got what you're looking for.

868
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.442
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
Ben.</i>

869
01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:33.777
I want to speak to Nick.

870
01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:36.913
<i>I'll text
you a time and location.</i>

871
01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.415
<i>I'll reckon
we'll make a trade.</i>

872
01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.828
That's an old bauxite factory.

873
01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:53.530
There is a safehouse

874
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.364
the Americans use near there.

875
01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:59.135
You know they'll kill you.

876
01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:00.704
Once they get what they want.

877
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.107
I'm willing
to take that chance.

878
01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.685
I'm sensing some anger.

879
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.387
Yeah. I'm a tad pissed off

880
01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.790
my wife turned out
to be a double-agent.

881
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.192
Are you mad about that or
because she had self-agency?

882
01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.229
Don't gimme that crap.

883
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.231
Your wife did her own thing.

884
01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:30.233
She ran her own ops
and she made the calls

885
01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:32.569
and she never talked
about anything ever.

886
01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.203
And look where that got her.

887
01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.339
Maybe it's not what
you think it is.

888
01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:38.074
It's exactly
what I think it is.

889
01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:41.210
So what's your plan?

890
01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.847
Give 'em what they want
and I get my son.

891
01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.582
You do know that
once they make the trade

892
01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:46.716
you're dead. right?

893
01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:48.484
And if you give them
Farrah's laptop.

894
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.119
her death would have been
for nothing.

895
01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.358
This isn't your fight.

896
01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:57.561
True.

897
01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:59.763
But if anything goes wrong.
they'll come for me.

898
01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.599
Not if we're smart
about this.

899
01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.544
I'll drive.

900
01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:26.623
Yo. Mr. ML.
How was Hungary?

901
01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.157
It's good. good.
How's Virginia?

902
01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.126
<i>I wouldn't know.
I'm in London.</i>

903
01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:31.695
<i>- Embassy's a lot bigger...</i>
- Yeah.

904
01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:32.428
<i>- ...than I thought actually.</i>
- I'm a little busy. listen.

905
01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:33.563
I'm sending you a link.

906
01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:34.931
How pressing is this?

907
01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.199
Life or death.

908
01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.767
<i>You need to look at it now.</i>

909
01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:39.335
<i>This thing
is rotten to the top.</i>

910
01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:41.204
On it.

911
01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:43.472
Thanks.

912
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:54.550
Oh. my God.

913
01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:43.359
John.

914
01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:46.629
Ben.

915
01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.288
I'm sorry.

916
01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:13.790
Get in the car. Nick.

917
01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:22.832
See?

918
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.334
It's not so bad.

919
01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:27.536
Working together again.

920
01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:31.474
It's like the good old days.

921
01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.143
I get what I want.
and you get what you want.

922
01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:36.045
Everybody's happy.

923
01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:39.048
I leave here today.

924
01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.318
you never hear from me again.

925
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.055
I know.

926
01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:18.354
Fuck!

927
01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:25.761
It's empty.

928
01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:27.897
Nick.

929
01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.668
He has the backpack.

930
01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:34.403
If we don't get it.
you don't get paid.

931
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.245
Come on.

932
01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:58.828
Hold on!

933
01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:03.732
Nick. get down!

934
01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:09.172
Uh. Dad. Dad.
what do I do. Dad?

935
01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:11.340
- I drive. you shoot.
- Shoot?

936
01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.085
The man in that car
is a trained assassin.

937
01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:23.519
He wants to kill us.

938
01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.654
And he will
if we don't kill him first.

939
01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:34.297
Shoot. Nick!

940
01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:38.267
Fuck!

941
01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:24.380
Ah. shit!

942
01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.215
- I said shoot. shoot. Nick!
- It's empty!

943
01:21:38.661 --> 01:21:39.895
Below the barrel.

944
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.330
the grenade launcher.
you've got one shot.

945
01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:02.751
They're gaining on us.

946
01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.626
I ever teach you

947
01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:11.995
the precision
immobilization technique?

948
01:22:11.995 --> 01:22:13.096
The PIT maneuver?

949
01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.368
Watch out!

950
01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:29.545
Motherfucker!

951
01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:16.092
I regret not killing your son
when I had the chance.

952
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.029
But at least.

953
01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:22.631
I got your wife.

954
01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:36.445
Let's go. Nick.

955
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:49.225
Good job.

956
01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:00.236
What happened to Branca?

957
01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.071
I don't know.

958
01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.208
Rats have a habit
of surviving.

959
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:09.145
Wait. You're going back?

960
01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:12.281
We left someone behind.

961
01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:47.750
Branca.

962
01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.405
You are a stubborn fuck.

963
01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:48.577
Get up. you old fuck.

964
01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.247
I said get up!

965
01:26:15.304 --> 01:26:17.139
I told you
about your back. John.

966
01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.008
You never were a good student.

967
01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:45.301
It's one of them.

968
01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.743
Come on. John. get up.

969
01:26:59.482 --> 01:27:00.516
Put the gun down. son.

970
01:27:01.617 --> 01:27:03.286
Listen to me.

971
01:27:03.286 --> 01:27:04.953
You have the opportunity.
to do the right thing here.

972
01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:06.455
I want you to put the gun
away. give me your keys

973
01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:07.990
and walk away.

974
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:09.925
- Walk away?
- Walk away.

975
01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.027
- I can't do that. sir.
- You can and you will.

976
01:27:14.196 --> 01:27:15.598
There'll be questions.

977
01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.666
Just tell the truth.

978
01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:20.403
Do it. son.

979
01:27:22.305 --> 01:27:23.372
Good luck. sir.

980
01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:41.790
Is this our new vehicle?

981
01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:47.396
You know. I never understood

982
01:27:47.396 --> 01:27:49.498
why Farrah loved
being a handler so much.

983
01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:52.701
It's 'cause she got to work
with people like you.

984
01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:55.270
Your wife

985
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.940
was one of the good ones.
Benjamin.

986
01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.643
Somebody you'd be willing
to lay your life down for.

987
01:28:03.379 --> 01:28:05.047
I'll find my own way
out of here.

988
01:28:05.047 --> 01:28:06.114
Hey.

989
01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:08.951
When this is all over...

990
01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.254
don't be a stranger.

991
01:28:13.956 --> 01:28:14.990
I won't.

992
01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.560
Someone needs to keep
an eye on you.

993
01:28:46.088 --> 01:28:48.557
Yo. Mr. M.
you trying to get me fired?

994
01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:49.825
Why. what'd you find?

995
01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.494
<i>Hold on.</i>

996
01:28:51.494 --> 01:28:53.195
<i>Listen to me. Farrah died
gathering this intel</i>

997
01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:54.296
<i>so what can you verify?</i>

998
01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:56.599
Yeah. only enough information

999
01:28:56.599 --> 01:28:58.133
to take down
the Deputy Director.

1000
01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:01.370
But I figured you knew
that already. right?

1001
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:02.905
<i>What do you really want?</i>

1002
01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:04.807
To know if you can hack
this year's spook-a-thon.

1003
01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:07.976
DCI round table's in Croatia.

1004
01:29:09.412 --> 01:29:11.279
so yeah. it's doable.

1005
01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:13.516
All right. thanks. Dez.
I owe ya.

1006
01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:17.185
Yeah.

1007
01:29:25.327 --> 01:29:27.430
You once asked me
to work for you.

1008
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:28.997
now I'm asking you
to work for me.

1009
01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:35.638
One last favor

1010
01:29:35.638 --> 01:29:37.673
for old time's sake.

1011
01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.142
And I told the DCI.

1012
01:29:40.142 --> 01:29:43.812
"No ma'am.
the phrase intel failure

1013
01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.048
"isn't an oxymoron.

1014
01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:48.617
"it's a redundancy!"

1015
01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:55.057
I wanna close by telling
each and every one of you...

1016
01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:58.093
...how much your wisdom

1017
01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:00.629
and guidance has meant to me
over the years.

1018
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:03.466
As I've endeavored to

1019
01:30:03.466 --> 01:30:06.735
steer...

1020
01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:14.376
- Oh. my God...
- Oh. my...

1021
01:30:26.188 --> 01:30:27.222
This is bullshit.

1022
01:30:28.591 --> 01:30:29.625
It's a complete joke.

1023
01:30:31.894 --> 01:30:33.996
You can't prove any of it!

1024
01:30:33.996 --> 01:30:37.432
For Christ's sake. you'd need
the head of the goddamn FSB

1025
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:40.703
to corroborate what...

1026
01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:09.598
Hello!

1027
01:31:11.366 --> 01:31:15.704
It's nice to see so many
old adversaries in same room.

1028
01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.573
Where nobody is tied to chair.

1029
01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:20.809
As most of you know.

1030
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:25.213
I am Evgeny Kalinakov.

1031
01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:30.485
I was FSB Chief of Station.
Budapest. last 11 years.

1032
01:31:31.286 --> 01:31:34.022
And I can confirm...

1033
01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:36.859
that all evidence
you have seen

1034
01:31:37.626 --> 01:31:38.994
is true.

1035
01:31:40.295 --> 01:31:42.698
To best of my knowledge.

1036
01:31:42.698 --> 01:31:46.869
You take the word of some
Russian operative over mine?

1037
01:31:46.869 --> 01:31:48.604
<i>Get rid of Malloy.</i>

1038
01:31:48.604 --> 01:31:51.073
<i>Repeat.
you are authorized to go hot</i>

1039
01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:54.009
<i>and take whatever steps
are necessary to liquidate him</i>

1040
01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:56.378
<i>- and his son.
- </i>

1041
01:31:56.378 --> 01:31:58.714
"Clear up all loose ends". no?

1042
01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.384
Is message...

1043
01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:04.720
from Benjamin.

1044
01:32:10.626 --> 01:32:11.660
This way.

1045
01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:19.902
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

1046
01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:27.475
Hey. dad.

1047
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:30.813
- Hey. you two.
- Sorry. we're late.

1048
01:32:30.813 --> 01:32:33.481
Hey. 10 minutes late in Paris
is on time.

1049
01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.417
You are very dapper.
Mr. Malloy.

1050
01:32:35.417 --> 01:32:36.484
Thank you. Veronique.

1051
01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:37.686
The new French Chief
of Station

1052
01:32:37.686 --> 01:32:39.387
- has to look the part.
- Hm.

1053
01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.756
Mom would be really proud.

1054
01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:41.857
Yeah. she would.

1055
01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:45.193
"The moral arc of the universe
is long..."

1056
01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:47.195
Yes. "but it bends
toward justice."

1057
01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.198
Congratulations
on the new job. Nick.

1058
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.935
I'm very proud of you.
