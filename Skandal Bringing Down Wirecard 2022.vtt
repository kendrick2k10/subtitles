2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.640
In Autumn 2019.
I got a call from a source.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.960
He asks me.
"Have you ever looked into Wirecard?"

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.520
"The payment processor? No."

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.440
"It's a very strange company."

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.720
"Companies are being set up."

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.520
"Money comes in. money goes out."

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.640
That is totally spooky.

10
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.440
He'd been called by foreign friends

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.920
who used to work in intelligence agencies.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.440
and they warned him.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.080
"Are you interested in Wirecard?"

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.720
"Keep your hands off it."

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.480
<i>Mr. Braun. reports about your business</i>

16
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.120
<i>read like a financial thriller.</i>

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.040
<i> Bogus sales.</i>

18
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.960
<i>balance sheet manipulations.</i>
<i>many allegations.</i>

19
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.840
<i> The former COO.</i>
<i>Jan Marsalek. is on the run.</i>

20
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.360
<i> The biggest fraud scandal</i>
<i>in German history.</i>

21
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.320
<i> There's</i>
<i>an international manhunt for Jan Marsalek.</i>

22
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.640
It's unbelievable how something
like this can survive for so long.

23
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.280
It was clear to me
this was going to be a huge story.

24
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.040
Scammers take advantage
of people's desires.

25
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.440
In Germany. the desire was.
"We want to be at the front of the pack."

26
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.480
Germany's industry is extremely successful

27
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.240
but very old. very traditional.

28
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.000
These famous German brands
like Siemens. Daimler. BMW. Volkswagen.

29
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.640
these are all very old companies.

30
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.120
That's why German politicians

31
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.480
and German business people
are often asked.

32
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.520
"Where are actually your new companies?"

33
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.080
We want a major. global.
digital champion of our own

34
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.640
like in Silicon Valley.

35
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.640
The German Google. the German Facebook.

36
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.200
And Wirecard played
on that desire beautifully.

37
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.000
Wirecard was like the German PayPal.

38
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.560
Wirecard the processor

39
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.640
for online trade. online shops.

40
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.520
They make sure when I buy something.

41
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.720
the money gets from my credit card
to the online retailer.

42
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.640
There's a company founder dressed

43
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.720
in a black turtleneck
with a neat turn of phrase…

44
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.440
…who presents himself as a visionary.

45
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.440
The "Steve Jobs of the Alps."

46
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.680
Wirecard is one of
the fastest-growing

47
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.440
financial commerce platforms.

48
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.080
Wirecard jumped
on the digital train in the '90s

49
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.040
that continues to pick up speed.

50
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.000
and now Wirecard
has even overtaken Deutsche Bank

51
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.640
with their worth placed
at over €20 billion.

52
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.200
A symbol
for the new era of the finance sector.

53
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.800
This was a company on the rise.

54
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.200
It grew unlike any other company
we'd seen in Germany.

55
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.280
And that rise. that immense growth.
led many people to believe in it.

56
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.960
New. successful.
global. profitable

57
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960
and German politicians were proud
to be able to say.

58
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.000
"Hey. We have a FinTech company!"

59
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.680
When the chancellor went to China.

60
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.400
she actually campaigned
for Wirecard in 2019 with Xi Jinping.

61
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.520
Everyone in Germany
believed in this company.

62
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.000
No one would have believed
that this was the work of gangsters.

63
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.760
Outside of Europe.
we see a growth of 25%

64
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.160
strongly driven by new regions.
by developing regions of Asia.

65
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.800
My name is Tobias Bosler.

66
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.280
and I have been.
for many years. a short seller.

67
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.720
Most people invest
thinking a share price will rise.

68
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.240
A short seller differs from an investor
by making money when a share price falls

69
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.640
and loses money when it increases.

70
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.000
I investigated Wirecard for two years.

71
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.200
I understood its business model perfectly.

72
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.520
It handled payments for online businesses
in pornography and online gambling.

73
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.080
but it wasn't illegal.

74
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.240
What would you call them?

75
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.280
- Are you joking?
-I'm not joking.

76
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.480
The poker market in the US
was 50% of the global poker market.

77
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.000
But that all changed in 2006

78
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.640
when a new law in America made it illegal

79
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.320
to handle payments
for US citizens playing poker.

80
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.400
So Wirecard lost a major source of income.

81
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.800
But. in spite of this law.
the profits of Wirecard kept rising.

82
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.280
What company is able to do that?

83
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.120
This can't be right.

84
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.640
In Germany.
short sellers have a bad reputation.

85
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.760
The perception is because they are betting
on the share price dropping.

86
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.960
they are actively seeking
to destroy companies.

87
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.640
Jobs are lost and that can't be good.

88
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.480
The Zatarra Report
wasn't seen as credible.

89
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.800
The criticism was always.
"What kind of report is this?"

90
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.680
"There isn't enough evidence
to back up its claims."

91
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.560
"It's just mud-slinging

92
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.280
because German companies
do not make mistakes."

93
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.960
It was seen very strongly as an attack
on Germany itself. on German companies.

94
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.200
A few weeks
after I opened the short position.

95
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.520
I got a call from the Wirecard lawyer.

96
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.040
He says. "You are short-selling Wirecard."

97
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.800
I thought. "How did you figure that out?"

98
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.560
He read me all the transactions.

99
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.840
Date. time. amount. rate.

100
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.000
He knew everything.
Then he says. "We need to talk."

101
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.880
He arrived with two thugs.

102
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.560
They looked exactly
as you imagine thugs to be.

103
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.320
Straightaway they pushed me

104
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.440
and punched the wall with full force.

105
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.080
I admit I was really scared.

106
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.440
What company sends a bunch of thugs
to an investor's office?

107
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.040
After that.
I stopped looking into Wirecard.

108
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.040
I let it be.

109
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.800
And no one else looked closely
into Wirecard.

110
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.000
except Dan McCrum.

111
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.120
My dear shareholders…

112
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.920
Well. if I find a weak spot. but I'm…

113
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.560
It's not working. It's not cold enough.

114
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.320
Marsalek is a completely different type.

115
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.440
Extremely charming.

116
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.440
very approachable. a great communicator.

117
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.880
Everything Braun didn't have.
Marsalek had.

118
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.320
which is why they were a great team.

119
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.480
I think that very few people knew
who Jan Marsalek really was.

120
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.520
He is certainly
at the center of this scandal.

121
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.320
He is the one
who made sure that the turnover

122
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.000
was always the way his boss.
Braun. wanted.

123
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.560
<i> The German Stock Exchange</i>
<i>is richer because of one company.</i>

124
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.080
<i>The payment-processing company.</i>
<i>Wirecard. from Aschheim near Munich</i>

125
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.800
<i>has made the leap</i>
<i>into the stock market premier league.</i>

126
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.280
Wirecard's share price last year
was €77.40.

127
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.040
Today it stands at €189.40.

128
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.400
Our figures tell a story
of strong growth.

129
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.440
How our business is valued
is a question for the investors.

130
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.680
Wirecard has shaken up
the German stock exchange this week

131
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.080
and kicked the Commerzbank
out of the elite DAX index.

132
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.960
A lot of investors
believe in German values.

133
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.760
and now it has the DAX seal of approval.

134
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.200
So a lot of people thought a DAX company

135
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.680
would be tightly regulated
by the German authorities.

136
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.400
Who wouldn't be thrilled
to have money invested in Wirecard?

137
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.880
-What's with the glasses?
- Best without glasses.

138
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.120
I only heard about
the <i>Financial Times'</i> coverage secondhand.

139
00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.280
NEW ATTACK ON WIRECARD

140
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.000
It was the typical bias.

141
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.000
They said. "It is a foreign conspiracy
against a German company."

142
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.160
"A German company is the victim
and must be protected."

143
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.120
Wirecard had hired
a famous lawyer in Bavaria.

144
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.440
The lawyer said
to the public prosecutor. Baumler-Hosl.

145
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.160
that Wirecard is under attack
by short sellers

146
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.320
and its very existence is in jeopardy.

147
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.040
Hildegard Baumler-Hosl contacted
the German financial regulator.

148
00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.520
The regulator BaFin then said.
"We need to protect Wirecard."

149
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.040
And banned short-selling
of Wirecard shares.

150
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.040
And even filed criminal charges
against Dan McCrum and Stefania Palma.

151
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.840
This financial thriller
continues with the latest punch-up

152
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.040
between Wirecard and the <i>Financial Times.</i>

153
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.800
<i> In February.</i>
<i>there were new articles and allegations</i>

154
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.640
<i>and the share price fell again.</i>

155
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.800
<i>At the end of March.</i>
<i>new accusations were published</i>

156
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.240
<i>and the share price collapsed once again.</i>

157
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.680
A BILLIONAIRE ON THE DEFENSIVE

158
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.560
- Sound running.
-Okay. Let's start.

159
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.800
How do you personally go about scandals.
confusion. chaos?

160
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.840
Have you ever thought about resigning?

161
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.920
I've never thought
about resignation.

162
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.760
Can you exclude the possibility
of more dirty laundry airing

163
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.840
that will put the share price
under pressure?

164
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.040
We firmly reject
these serious allegations.

165
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.680
We think these allegations
are mainly market speculations.

166
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.360
<i>At the Frankfurt stock exchange.</i>

167
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.600
<i>Wirecard has announced its annual results.</i>
<i>increasing its profits by 35%.</i>

168
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.320
<i>an increase of €350 million.</i>

169
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.960
<i>and says it will continue</i>
<i>to grow this year.</i>

170
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.680
Drink as much as you can take. here!

171
00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.800
<i>-Hey. I'm Nick Gold.</i>
- <i>Hello. Nick. How are you?</i>

172
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.960
<i> What sort of size business</i>
<i>were you thinking of doing?</i>

173
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.520
<i>At the moment.</i>
<i>they are looking at investing €50 million.</i>

174
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.440
<i> Okay.</i>

175
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.120
There was a short seller. Nick Gold.

176
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.840
who met with an investor
who secretly recorded him.

177
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.880
<i>This is as good as it gets in terms of--</i>

178
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.000
<i>-We know the article's coming.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

179
00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.640
<i> And I bet it's gonna be today.</i>

180
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.240
We know now that this investor
was actually a private detective

181
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:46.720
who was hired
by someone associated with Wirecard.

182
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.920
I'm Jorg Schmitt
from the Süddeutsche Zeitung.

183
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.840
I'm the chief editor
of the investigations team.

184
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:56.240
I was at my desk when I suddenly
got a call from an unknown number.

185
00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.720
On the other end was a young woman.

186
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.920
She said.
"Are you interested in Wirecard?"

187
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.600
"Do you know Prinzregentenstrasse 61?"

188
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.960
"It's the secret office of Jan Marsalek."

189
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.960
Even colleagues closest
to Marsalek didn't know

190
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.240
that there was this second office
in the Prinzregentenstrasse.

191
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.840
He would meet
with a very illustrious circle of people.

192
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.680
do business. and host wild parties.

193
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.480
It's Marsalek's boy gang. I'd say.

194
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.040
We always find Martin W..

195
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.360
who had been
in the Austrian secret service.

196
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.320
El-Obeidi.
a former Libyan intelligence officer.

197
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.760
Stani. a Russian who was supposedly
in Munich visiting his sick mother.

198
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:55.040
but we think he was probably an FSB man.
a Russian secret-service agent.

199
01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.720
So suddenly
we had three former intelligence agents

200
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.400
who were in and around
the Prinzregentenstrasse.

201
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.640
And the thing is the Prinzregentenstrasse
is not just anywhere in Munich.

202
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.920
It is directly opposite
the Russian consulate.

203
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.400
There is obviously
a secret-service connection.

204
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.080
That electrified me.

205
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.600
Why might Marsalek be so interesting
to intelligence agencies?

206
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.960
Wirecard is a company

207
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.880
through which there are billions
of transactions every year.

208
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.120
And these payments are gold mines
for the secret services

209
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.600
because they show who could be compromised

210
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.880
because their creditcard information
could show porn usage.

211
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.920
brothel visits. or whatever else.

212
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.080
To have a source like Marsalek

213
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.640
who is always
on the move around the world.

214
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.560
that makes a lot of sense.

215
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.040
Vienna is sadly mostly
an inviting terrain

216
01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.200
for intelligence officers.

217
01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.000
for dubious characters.
spies. economic spies.

218
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.280
Border security in Libya was a topic that.

219
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.440
for a COO of a company like Wirecard.
wasn't normal in the slightest.

220
01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.240
As time went on. I asked myself.
"What does he want in Libya?"

221
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.560
"And why does he seem
to be getting support

222
01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.040
from within the Austrian government

223
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.560
for a project
that doesn't have humanitarian aims?"

224
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.840
If you ignore negative trends

225
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.160
or if you let immigration go unchecked.

226
01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.680
things will go downhill very quickly.

227
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.480
It is logical that if Russia

228
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.960
wants to destabilize Europe.

229
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.840
they would try to create anxiety
over supposed waves of refugees

230
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.720
to create a narrative
that heats the debate again.

231
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.720
Marsalek has very good contacts in Russia.

232
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.120
That's why it's plausible
that Jan Marsalek could have been trying

233
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.400
to set something up for the Russians.

234
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.360
It's criminal to wiretap journalists.

235
01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.240
It's criminal
to hack their email accounts.

236
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:18.440
The worst part was that this intimidation
was quite successful.

237
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.520
<i>The Financial Times</i> had launched
an internal inquiry into Dan McCrum.

238
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.760
and Wirecard made the most of this time.

239
01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.360
and its market price kept rising.

240
01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:36.040
They even got the German Chancellor
to promote the company in China.

241
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.520
All this happened in those months
when the <i>Financial Times</i>

242
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.080
didn't write anything critical
of Wirecard.

243
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.200
Dr. Markus Braun. you've decided

244
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.000
to carry out an external audit

245
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:32.200
due to the allegations
that the <i>FT </i>have made.

246
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.760
The question is. "Why only now?"

247
01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.200
Well. we reacted very quickly.

248
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.120
The newspaper article was published
only over a week ago.

249
01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.400
At first. Braun didn't want this inquiry.

250
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.680
We reject these allegations 100%.

251
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.480
People at Wirecard must have known
that this is going to be troublesome.

252
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.160
When will the auditors present
their report?

253
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.320
I don't want to jump the gun.
but we think within a few months.

254
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.680
We believe
we will have results very quickly.

255
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.480
My name is Joachim Giehl.

256
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.760
I am Markus Braun's neighbor.

257
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.640
I always had the impression

258
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.320
that this man is under
a massive amount of pressure.

259
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.560
He greeted nobody as his neighbor.

260
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.800
He always just got in his car.

261
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.840
No hello. no nothing.

262
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.960
There was one day. around 8:30 p.m..

263
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.000
I parked my car in the garage.

264
01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.200
It was dark. and I saw Markus Braun
at the entrance to our building.

265
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.920
I saw him in the lamplight.
and he looked extremely tense.

266
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.960
He was surrounded by some men
whom I didn't recognize.

267
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.240
They seemed out of place.

268
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.600
They didn't look like businesspeople.

269
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:43.000
They looked like people
who work as security. bodyguards.

270
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.280
a group of thugs…

271
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.120
…or people like that.

272
01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.240
They didn't look
like they were there to protect him.

273
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.560
Rather. I thought they were there…

274
01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.360
…to do a job.

275
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.640
It was called "Project Panther."

276
01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.360
a plan for a hostile takeover.

277
01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.440
A large consulting company
put a document together

278
01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.920
which showed how it could make sense

279
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.480
to merge an old bank
with a new tech company.

280
01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.760
The "Wirebank."
or whatever it would have been called.

281
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.760
The idea was

282
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.760
if you merged these two companies.

283
01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.920
with the Deutsche Bank balance
being so much bigger than Wirecard's.

284
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.440
that then maybe the fraud at Wirecard
would somehow get swept under the rug.

285
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.960
Auditors can
no longer locate €1.9 billion

286
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.680
that are said to be
in escrow accounts in Asia.

287
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.920
<i> The two banks</i>
<i>in the Philippines</i>

288
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.440
<i>where the €1.9 billion was supposed to be</i>

289
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.920
<i>said today</i>
<i>that they had no business relations</i>

290
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.680
<i>with the payments processor.</i>

291
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.240
<i>The documents were faked.</i>

292
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.160
The share price plunged by 70%.

293
01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.520
Ladies and gentlemen.

294
01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.720
on behalf
of the management board of Wirecard.

295
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.920
I would like to give
the following explanation.

296
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.960
The press conference that night
was like <i>The Muppet Show</i>.

297
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.480
Braun reads from the teleprompter.

298
01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.040
The death sentence
has already been handed out.

299
01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:27.680
and he's still making it seem
as if he's going to announce

300
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.760
an amazing quarterly report next month.

301
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.120
Right now.
it cannot be ruled out that Wirecard

302
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.520
has become the damaged party

303
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.040
in a fraud case
of considerable proportions.

304
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.800
Where is the COO
of the insolvent payment processor.

305
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.760
Wirecard. the Austrian. Jan Marsalek?

306
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.760
An agent always has an escape route.

307
01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:35.960
We knew that Marsalek was in the office
until that Friday afternoon.

308
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.920
He supposedly said

309
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.960
he had to go to the Philippines
to clear the whole thing up.

310
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.360
He went for dinner
with Martin W. that evening.

311
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.000
Martin W.. who he knew
from the Prinzregentenstrasse

312
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.120
and who used to be
in the Austrian secret service

313
01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.320
together with an Austrian.
right-wing politician

314
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.240
booked Marsalek a flight.

315
01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.360
Marsalek paid close to €8.000 in cash…

316
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.760
and then his trail disappeared.

317
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.400
He didn't go to the Philippines.

318
01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.480
It doesn't make sense.

319
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.280
He couldn't have entered the country
because of quarantine regulations.

320
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.160
There are databases
where you can check flight data.

321
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.000
Since 2015.
he flew at least 60 times to Russia.

322
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.920
And there was one flight

323
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.800
from a small airport near Vienna to Minsk.

324
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.480
It's not far from Moscow.

325
01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.320
The border to Russia is not controlled.
and that's where the trail is lost.

326
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.120
After that. it's just rumors.

327
01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.960
We don't know for certain if Marsalek

328
01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.400
was actually a secret-service informant
or not.

329
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.960
Jan Marsalek was
very well-connected

330
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.680
in the secret service parallel world.

331
01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.120
and that's why I think he won't be
that easy to find.

332
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.360
We know
that he's online occasionally

333
01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.080
via an old Telegram account.

334
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.280
I can check again.

335
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.880
He's been online every few months.

336
01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.880
The last time was on May 27. 2021.

337
01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.760
<i>The German parliament has started</i>

338
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.960
<i>a political inquiry into Wirecard.</i>

339
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.960
one of the biggest scandals
of the German republic.

340
01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.760
A financial disaster for those
who invested their money in Wirecard.

341
01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.440
<i> It was</i>
<i>the first DAX-listed company to go bust.</i>

342
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.520
I think that Wirecard's inner circle

343
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.440
who knew what was really going on
was very small.

344
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.720
Certainly Marsalek.

345
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.720
The fascinating question is.
"What did Braun know about all this?"

346
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.040
He wasn't emotional.
He was very tense.

347
01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.120
And then he gave
a short opening statement.

348
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.120
"All I can say… is we were all deceived."

349
01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.360
"I'm a victim."

350
01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.000
And then his lawyer said
he won't answer any further questions.

351
01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.080
He really sat there for three hours
and didn't answer.

352
01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.160
I think so far.
we only know the tip of the iceberg.

353
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:39.400
Unless Jan Marsalek turns up somewhere
and breaks his silence.

354
01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.880
only then will we get the full story.
