3
00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.125
Give me the rest...

4
00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:46.751
Do not throw that away.

5
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:48.003
Why do you want to keep it?

6
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:48.920
It's unsanitary.

7
00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.130
It's none of your business.

8
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:53.925
Get out of here!

9
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.344
Get out of here.

10
00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.667
Stop this atrocity!

11
00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:28.960
It's indecent...

12
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:29.711
...criminal...

13
00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:30.879
...and you are blaspheming...

14
00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:32.547
...by keeping this bloody metal!

15
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:33.840
She's blaspheming?

16
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.467
I'm blaspheming?

17
00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.512
The metal was obscene when it went in.

18
00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.474
I redeem it when I take it out.

19
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.934
You prefer to keep it all hidden.

20
00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.771
It insults God...

21
00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.064
...and the families
of the dead and the wounded.

22
00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.607
No. she's right.

23
00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.984
No. she's right.

24
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.695
She can keep this bloody metal.

25
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.200
-She's right.
-You see?

26
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.585
How dare you!

27
00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:05.445
The red sun.

28
00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:09.115
Some grapefruit.

29
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.867
The handkerchief.

30
00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:13.620
The red sun...

31
00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:17.248
...some grapefruit...

32
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:20.918
...the handkerchief...

33
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.088
...when you call.

34
00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:30.011
To see a face...

35
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.471
...whose?

36
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.390
My name...

37
00:24:34.474 --> 00:24:36.976
...Thy own name.

38
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.980
It's vivid. the moment...

39
00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:43.274
...to love. to be.

40
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.777
The beach is warm...

41
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.236
The sky is cold...

42
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.946
Death is real...

43
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.448
...when we're dying.

44
00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:53.201
But the sky...

45
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:58.456
...is warm with friends.
