<i>Growing up in New York.

<i>My parents had

80
00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.265
so I think I had
a really good childhood.

81
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.866
I wouldn't trade it or change it

82
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:30.000

83
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.666
And while we were together.
we had three amazing children.

{\an8}<i>Kailynn. Zuri. and Zamir.</i>

94
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.265
{\an8}When I grow.
I wanna be a surgeon

95
00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:58.367
{\an8}'cause they make a lot of money.

96
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:01.000
{\an8}[DeeDee] <i>My fourth kid</i>

99
00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:12.265
{\an8}You wanna be the Pride?

100
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.766
Oh. okay.

101
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:15.999
{\an8}I always pictured
the "perfect life."

102
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.500
{\an8}Like. white picket fence.

103
00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:19.666

And now. I mean. I'm a lesbian.

106
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:26.500
I'm in an interracial
relationship.

107
00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:28.600
I didn't expect any of this
for myself.

108
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:29.999
You wanna support your mommies?

109
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.098

<i>at the age of 18.</i>

114
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.400
<i>and we were married
for 11 years.</i>

115
00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.766
My ex-husband was my first.

116
00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:45.100
because I was taught
that you have to be a virgin

117
00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.766
when you get married.

118
00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:48.000
<i>Follows married.</i>

122
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.000
{\an8}Which one do you guys like more.

123
00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:03.000
Mama or Mommy?

124
00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.500
- Mama.
- Who's the meanest?

125
00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:05.800
- Mommy.
- Ma.

126
00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:07.000
- Ma.
- Mommy.

127
00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:08.000
What?

128
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:09.366
I'm Mommy.

129
00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:10.700
And I'm Mama.

130
00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.866
because DeeDee didn't like
how southern that sounded.

131
00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:15.165
- [Whitney] Who's the nicest?
- Me.

132
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.366
Who thinks Mommy is the nicest?

133
00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:17.566
- Raise your hand.
- Yeah.

134
00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.099
- I. I think--
- [DeeDee] I'm offended.

135
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.400
Y'all wanna get ice cream?

136
00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:24.000
[all] Yeah!

137
00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.400
All right. follow Mommy.

138
00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:27.566
- One. two. three--
- Four. five. six. seven.

139
00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.666
Okay.

140
00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:29.999
The world is changing.

141
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.098
The world is changing.

142
00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.000
<i>Unfortunately. our town
is not changing quickly.</i>

143
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:35.566
All right.
We have a big order.

144
00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:39.566
And same sex relationships
are still very iffy.

145
00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.466
{\an8}Mommy. I'm ready.

146
00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:43.566
{\an8}How do girls and girls
have baby?

147
00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.666
[Kailynn]
So. how about two girls.

148
00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:46.667
how do they have babies?

149
00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:48.099
How do two girls have babies?

150
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.466
- [DeeDee] Uh-huh.
- Damiya. you wanna answer it?

151
00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:52.366
- [laughter]
- LGBTQ is not heard of

152
00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:53.634
where we're at.

153
00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.767
So. that community is
definitely one we don't have here.

154
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.466
- You look so cute.
- I'm so excited.

155
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:06.666
So ready to dance.

156
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.566
We met doing dance class.

157
00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:10.100
I was her instructor.

158
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.566
[Whitney]
<i>It had been about six months</i>

159
00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:14.666
<i>after I had been divorced
before I met DeeDee.</i>

160
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.600
Ask him what you
want to ask him with the arm.

161
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.400
Oh. okay. So. for every
day. I'm still confused on it.

162
00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:22.666
'cause I go. and then I go
to the right or the left first?

163
00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:23.866
You go to the...
She go this way

164
00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:24.967
and I go to this way.

165
00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:27.767
[clear throats]

166
00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:28.867
I do.

167
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.967
[laughter]

168
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:34.567
- Right.
- No.

169
00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:35.700
- Oh.
- [DeeDee] See?

170
00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:36.800
Yeah. that one's pretty cute.

171
00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:38.466
She has better rhythm because...

172
00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:40.165
- Mmm-hmm.
- She was born with it.

173
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:41.666
But I had to work for mine.

174
00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.165
<i>I was not blessed
with the best rhythm.</i>

175
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.800
but I worked hard.

176
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.065
and I really feel like...

177
00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:49.165
I don't dance like
a crazy White girl.

178
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.999
- Eyy! Eyy!
- [laughter]

179
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.466
I'm so White.

180
00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:54.600
I'm so White.

181
00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.666
- All right. y'all.
- Left first?

182
00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:58.567
- Yeah.
- All right.

183
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.000
Hey!

184
00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:03.866
Hey!

185
00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:05.700
<i>So. my connection with DeeDee.</i>

186
00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:06.800
it was instant.

187
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.100
Hey!

188
00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.800
Now. we step it up.

189
00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.566
As months went by.
and we became friends...

190
00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:15.766
I started to confide in her
about a lot of things.

191
00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:17.600
you know.
my relationship issues.

192
00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.466
- Eyy! Eyy!
- [woman] What? What?

193
00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.366
- Eyy! Eyy!
- [woman] What? What?

194
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:22.799
Eyy!

195
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.700
[Whitney] <i>We're talking a lot
about. like. the men in my life</i>

196
00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:27.500
that were just constantly
giving me problems.

197
00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:28.567
- Eyy!
- Eyy!

198
00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:29.999
- Eyy!
- Eyy!

199
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.867
- Eyy!
- Eyy!

200
00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:31.000
But we just became closer
and closer.

201
00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:35.700
And then. I started asking her
more questions. like.

202
00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:38.165
"Have you ever thought
about being with the woman?"

203
00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:40.666
Uh. no. I... [chuckles]

204
00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.700
- Eyy! Eyy! Eyy!
- Wait!

205
00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:44.700
- Eyy!
- Okay!

206
00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:46.766
So. one day after dance class.

207
00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.766
we drove. and we went into.
like. a parking lot.

208
00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:53.500
and she ended up winning over.
and kissing me.

209
00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:54.700
I had never kissed a woman.

210
00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:56.700
and I didn't really know
how it was gonna be.

211
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.999
But that was a big change for me

212
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.967
But that was a big change for me

213
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:01.000
because I felt butterflies.

214
00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:06.100
and I began seeing DeeDee
in another way.

215
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:09.600
Kissing Whitney.
I just put sparks in my eyes

216
00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.767
and in my body and...

217
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.500
[sighs]

218
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.366
<i>And that's when I realized
that I loved her.</i>

219
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:20.567
Her kiss stole me away.

220
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.366
I don't know how you all feel
when you all kiss people.

221
00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:27.966
When I kiss her.
it goes everywhere.

222
00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:29.999
[Whitney] <i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>a little fun kiss</i>

223
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.900
[Whitney] <i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>a little fun kiss</i>

224
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:31.000
to completely change
my entire identity.

225
00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.600
but it did.

226
00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:37.366
And it was scary as hell.

227
00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:42.700
because I instantly knew
I could not lose her.

228
00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:44.666
[DeeDee] <i>After I kissed her.</i>
<i>every night.</i>

229
00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.966
like. I would go to sleep.
I would think about her.

230
00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.700
It just kept building
and building.

231
00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.766
And I couldn't get her
out of my mind.

232
00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.566
Yes. look at you.

233
00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:53.666
- That is...
- No.

234
00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:55.065
- Teamwork. babe.
- I thought it was just--

235
00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:56.700
- I love you.
- I love you too.

236
00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:59.200
I was aware that I was
falling in love with Whitney.

237
00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.000
and it made me
very confused and scared.

238
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and it made me
very confused and scared.

239
00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:05.466
<i>because at the time.
I was married to Will.</i>

240
00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:08.165
and struggling
to make my marriage work.

241
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:09.900
{\an8}[woman speaking]

242
00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:11.667
{\an8}[DeeDee] We're hoping
for this fall.

243
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.766
{\an8}- [Whitney] Yes. definitely.
- [DeeDee] Fall 2022.

244
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.600
{\an8}It was kind of. like.
a boom explosion.

245
00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.000
{\an8}It was just. like.
one day popped up.

246
00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:19.265
{\an8}boom. we're a couple.

247
00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.166
{\an8}And we were all like. "What?

248
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.000
{\an8}<i>When?"</i>

249
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.500
It was confusing
because we knew them

250
00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:27.766
to be straight.

251
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:28.999
She wants to take
my last name. y'all.

252
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000

But every relationship
has issues.

I don't think they're ready
for marriage still.

but it's time to wind down.

287
00:09:42.367 --> 00:09:44.366
All right. guys.
we need to say our prayers.

288
00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:45.800
and then we're gonna have
to go to sleep.

289
00:09:45.867 --> 00:09:47.700

You can say our prayer.

All through my childhood.

294
00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:58.666
I mainly did everything
in the church.

295

Close your eyes.

303

[Kailynn]
Now. I lay me down to sleep.

304
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.000
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

305
00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:22.165
When I came out.
I was no longer allowed

306
00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:24.666
<i>to lead worship.
As a Christian.</i>

307
00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.366
<i>you're able to come
to church as a lesbian.</i>

308

309

<i>So. I was made to step down.</i>

311
00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:38.165
That was the hardest thing
that I've ever experienced.

312
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:39.366
I was open and honest

313
00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:42.000
about loving a female.

314
00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:44.800
<i>That is the only thing
that changed.</i>

315

[Kailynn] If I should die
before I wake.

316
00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.866
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

317
00:10:48.867 --> 00:10:51.700
I lost who I was for the first.

318
00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.666
you know. 20-something
years of my life.

319

<i>And my family

00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:03.099
My grandmother still prays

324
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.065
that I will get back with my ex.

325

the same people that
loved me that. you know.

330
00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:21.700
looked up to me. to then them
completely turning their backs

331
00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:24.966
and being. like. "You're no
longer accepted as a leader."

332
00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:28.367
I never thought that it would
happen to me. you know?

333
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.000
I'm tired.

334
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000

- Well.
- Got to make this money.

337
00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:39.300

<i>- I decided to marry Will</i>

390
00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:44.999
because I thought that's
what I was supposed to do.

391
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.466
You know. I was in my mid-20s.

392
00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:47.999
<i>who was about to start a family.</i>

393

395
00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:51.000
And it felt right at the time.

396
00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.566
So. how was the kids
this weekend at the house?

397
00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.800
[sighs] Zamir. his attitude

398
00:13:56.867 --> 00:13:58.600
all weekend
has been up and down.

399
00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:01.400
<i>What DeeDee and I had
was very unique.</i>

400
00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:03.766
<i>It was a one of a kind
relationship.</i>

401
00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:06.300
<i>Some of our friends
were looking at us</i>

402
00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:09.265
as relationship goals
at the time.

403
00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:11.666
and it was just
a wonderful situation

404
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.032
<i>between the two of us.</i>

405
00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:15.766
When me and Will started
dating. I made it really clear to him

406
00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:18.466
that I like women.
He thought it was cool.

407
00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.113
<i>He didn't see nothing
wrong with that.</i>

408
00:14:20.114 --> 00:14:20.200
<i>He didn't see nothing
wrong with that.</i>

409
00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:21.000
<i>He asked me like.
"Are you still.</i>

410
00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:23.600
you know. into women?"
I'm like. "Yeah."

411
00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.366
I knew she was attracted
to women.

412
00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:27.766
but I never knew that
that was a void

413
00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:29.300
that she was missing.

414
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:30.666
How's everything going?

415
00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:32.800
Uh. I'm making it.
just still sore from surgery.

416
00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:34.265
but other than that. I'm good.

417
00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:35.766
When I told Will
I wanted a divorce.

418
00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:37.566
he was furious.

419
00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:39.265
Like. he started crying.

420
00:14:39.266 --> 00:14:41.100
It was bad.

421
00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:43.400
You know. I was truly in love
with that woman.

422
00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:45.566
<i>And I felt like
that was the woman</i>

423
00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:48.700
that I was gonna be with
until I took my last breath.

424
00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.113
You got somebody helping you?

425
00:14:50.114 --> 00:14:50.300
You got somebody helping you?

426
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:51.000
No. I'm all by myself.

427
00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:53.165
Solo-dolo.

428
00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.100
It's not that
I don't wanna date.

429
00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:57.100
it's just like. um. still have

430
00:14:57.166 --> 00:15:00.867
mixed reserved feelings
to you. unfortunately.

431
00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:04.866
I never really wanted
to leave him

432
00:15:04.867 --> 00:15:06.366
or break up my marriage.
But the things

433
00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:07.766
<i>that were missing
in my relationship</i>

434
00:15:07.767 --> 00:15:10.300
was all within me.
The emptiness that I felt

435
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.766
was me wanting to be
with a female.

436
00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:15.065
<i>He was fulfilling his role</i>

437
00:15:15.066 --> 00:15:16.800

in the house.

00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:16.366
We call it the quiet game.

513
00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:17.666
Mama DeeDee and Mama Whitney

514
00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:19.800
make me watch all the kids.
all the time.

515
00:18:19.867 --> 00:18:20.114
Three. two. one. go.

516
00:18:20.114 --> 00:18:21.000
Three. two. one. go.

517
00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:24.900
I can't.
I can't do this no more.

518
00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:26.900
[laughs] Zuri.

519
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:28.866
These kids are the best
birth control

520
00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:30.500
- that I wanted.
- Mama.

521
00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:32.000
- Why do you call me Mama?
- Mama.

522
00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:33.367
[screams]

523
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.566
Blending the families
at first was difficult.

524
00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:44.200
It was challenging.

525
00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:46.866
Our kids were not ready

526
00:18:46.867 --> 00:18:50.000
for two moms and a bunch
more kids in the house.

527
00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:50.112
The first time
we met each other.

528
00:18:50.113 --> 00:18:51.000
The first time
we met each other.

529
00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:52.566
you were hiding
behind the couch.

530
00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:54.766
- Yeah.
- You're like...

531
00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:57.100
Stop calling my name.

532
00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.566
It's too much.

533
00:18:58.567 --> 00:18:59.800
- I was scared...
- We're together.

534
00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.466
Of her before. but now.

535
00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:03.566
she's scared of me sometimes.

536
00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:05.300
I'm scared of you?

537
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.866
All right. guys. let's go.
Come downstairs.

538
00:19:11.867 --> 00:19:14.900
[indistinct chatter]

539
00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:17.100
We'll be home
around 5:00 baby. Okay?

540
00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:24.900
You start this one.

541
00:19:24.967 --> 00:19:26.566
Everybody have
your snack and drink?

542
00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:27.900
- [all] Yes.
- [Whitney] All right.

543
00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.766
- Everybody's happy.
- Whoo-whoo!

544
00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:31.500
Let's have a good day
at school. okay?

545
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.999
[DeeDee] <i>We have a lot</i>
<i>of talks with them.</i>

546
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.766
Like. "How do you feel
about us being gay?"

547
00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:37.065
Come on. we gotta catch the bus.

548
00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:38.466
- Thank you. baby.
<i>- I mean. having</i>

549
00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:40.065
a blended family.
that's what you have to do.

550
00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:41.666
- It's hard.
- A lot of conversations.

551
00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:43.566
a lot of family talks.
and getting everybody

552
00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:44.966
<i>on the same page.</i>

553
00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:46.265
When Whitney and DeeDee
got together.

554
00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:48.100
I remember being sad and angry

555
00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:50.113
because in my eyes.
Whitney broke up my family.

556
00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:50.767
Because in my eyes.
Whitney broke up my family.

557
00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:51.000
But after that time.
I grew to like Whitney.

558
00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:56.166
I feel like she made it better.

559
00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:58.800
[DeeDee] <i>At first.</i>
<i>the kids did not tell</i>

560
00:19:58.867 --> 00:20:00.366
their friends
that they had two moms.

561
00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:01.566
They were really embarrassed.

562
00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.065
But now. they're more open.

563
00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:04.900
- We're leaving the house.
- Bye. guys.

564
00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:06.900
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

565
00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:08.900
The other day.
this kid on the bus was like.

566
00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:11.099
"But she is Black.
How is she your sister?"

567
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.766
And I was like
"She's just my sister.

568
00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:14.166
- Don't worry about it."
- Yup.

569
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.112
I don't really wanna tell them

570
00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:21.000
I don't really wanna tell them

571
00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:23.767
because that would be
embarrassing.

572
00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:30.566
Because nobody else
has two moms.

573
00:20:30.567 --> 00:20:34.600
<i>It's like they'll think they
are gay. and stuff.</i>

574
00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:40.466
<i>At the end of the day.
we're still a family.</i>

575
00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:42.566
and we're happy.
and our kids are happy.

576
00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:43.999
and that's all that matters.

577
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.700
- You have a great day.
- [smooches] You too.

578
00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:47.900
- Are you late?
- Yeah.

579
00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:49.099
- I'm always late.
- [laughter]

580
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.113
- [Whitney] Y'all have fun.
- Bye.

581
00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:51.000
- [Whitney] Y'all have fun.
- Bye.

582
00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:53.467
- Have a good day at work.
- [Whitney] You too. babe.

583
00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:04.700
- Do I help?
- You just relax.

584
00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:06.165
We want you
to just watch the kids.

585
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.567
[indistinct]

586
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.566
[DeeDee] Everybody's okay?

587
00:21:11.567 --> 00:21:13.866
[girl] Yeah. we're gonna
stick our foot in it.

588
00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:14.999
- Oh.
- [girl] I'm cold.

589
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.700
That's amazing.

590
00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:18.866
Please be careful
around the water. guys.

591
00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:20.113
[girl] Okay.

592
00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:20.164
[girl] Okay.

593
00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:21.000
Babe. I'm so nervous.

594
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I think we're gonna be
fine. though.

595
00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:26.666
You really had to invite
Will. too. though?

596
00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:28.466
- [DeeDee] Zamir invited him.
- Okay.

597
00:21:28.467 --> 00:21:30.000
Don't you want your daddy here?

598
00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:31.165
Yeah. we need a little help.

599
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.265
[Whitney] You want daddy
at the barbecue?

600
00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:33.466
He could just hang out with him.

601
00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:35.866
[Whitney] Well. hopefully.
it'll go well.

602
00:21:35.867 --> 00:21:38.366
<i>Today is about
coming together as a family.</i>

603
00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:40.165
So we decided to invite Will

604
00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.666
and invite DeeDee's sisters.

605
00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:44.666
My anxiety is a little high.

606
00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.800
I had to invite them.

607
00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:49.666
Me. LaQuana. and Davena always
had a really close bond.

608
00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:50.114
<i>It wasn't up until I met Whitney</i>

609
00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:51.000
<i>It wasn't up until I met Whitney</i>

610
00:21:51.266 --> 00:21:52.866
when we started
having conflicts.

611
00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:55.566
Her sisters. they'll say
exactly what they feel

612
00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:56.700
no matter how it makes you feel.

613
00:21:56.767 --> 00:21:58.700
[DeeDee] Oh. they're here.

614
00:21:58.767 --> 00:22:00.165
They are brutal.

615
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:01.467
But they are sweet.

616
00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:03.867
Ish.

617
00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:07.100
{\an8}[all] <i>Coming up...</i>

618
00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:08.967
{\an8}[Whitney] Oh.
these are gonna burn.

619
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.967
It was very awkward
to say the least.

620
00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:15.866
Everything's okay.

621
00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:17.566
Okay. guys.
are your eyes closed?

622
00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:18.600
[all] Yes.

623
00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.113
[Whitney] Three. two. one.

624
00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:20.700
[Whitney] Three. two. one.

625
00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:21.000
[all gasp]

626
00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:24.165
- [woman] That's not the one.
- No. it's not the one.

627
00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:25.767
[sighs]

628
00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.266
Hey. guys.

629
00:22:36.967 --> 00:22:38.367
{\an8}Hey.

630
00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.065
[DeeDee] I'm glad y'all came.

631
00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:44.265
Yes. What we got going on?

632
00:22:44.266 --> 00:22:45.900
Because y'all know
I like to eat.

633
00:22:45.967 --> 00:22:47.666
[laughter]

634
00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:50.165
{\an8}Things with my sisters
right now are really awkward.

635
00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:51.566
{\an8}<i>My sisters are very judgy.</i>

636
00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:52.966
<i>They have a big heart. though.</i>

637
00:22:52.967 --> 00:22:54.100
- We're fishing?
- He's fishing.

638
00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:55.100
We both got to fish?

639
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:56.700
[DeeDee] No. Beckham knows
how to fish.

640
00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:57.866
He could teach you how to fish.

641
00:22:57.867 --> 00:22:59.221
- He knows how to fish?
- No.

642
00:22:59.222 --> 00:22:59.467
- He knows how to fish?
- No.

643
00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:00.000
Oh. I thought you said he knows.

644
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.866
I said he can teach you
how to fish.

645
00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:02.767
How? He doesn't even know.

646
00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:03.900
You asked me teach you
how to fish.

647
00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:05.200
I don't know how to fish.

648
00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:06.999
So he could teach you
how to fish.

649
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.100
[LaQuana] <i>Our sisterhood</i>
<i>right now is a little rocky.</i>

650
00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:12.065
{\an8}It used to be
three peas in a pod.

651
00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:14.200
We had a really.
really good sisterhood.

652
00:23:14.266 --> 00:23:16.999
We all did everything
basically together.

653
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.366
- Can I take my shoes off?
- Give me two minutes.

654
00:23:18.367 --> 00:23:20.265
Sure.
You should ask your auntie.

655
00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:21.766
We should take our shoes off?

656
00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:23.100
No. absolutely not.

657
00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:24.766
[Davena]
I don't even like sand.

658
00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:26.766
We a little boujee over here.

659
00:23:26.767 --> 00:23:28.366
I cannot.

660
00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:29.222
[girl] Thank you.

661
00:23:29.222 --> 00:23:29.266
[girl] Thank you.

662
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.000
{\an8}I want so badly
for Davena and LaQuana

663
00:23:32.266 --> 00:23:34.766
{\an8}to just accept me
into their sisterhood.

664
00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:37.366
<i>I honestly don't know why
they don't accept me.</i>

665
00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:41.065
but I do know that they
are very big on blood.

666
00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:42.999
<i>And I am just kind
of another female</i>

667
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.866
<i>that is stepping into
that territory</i>

668
00:23:44.867 --> 00:23:46.366
and it's a hard place to be in.

669
00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:49.065
I'm hungry. I'm about
to start cooking.

670
00:23:49.066 --> 00:23:50.200
- I wanna grill. babe.
- [DeeDee] You wanna grill?

671
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.266
[Whitney] Um. I can I do it?
Yeah.

672
00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:52.466
[DeeDee] I ain't gonna say
no to that.

673
00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:54.667
- [Whitney] Okay.
- What?

674
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.967
[chuckles]

675
00:23:56.967 --> 00:23:57.967
I got this.

676
00:23:57.968 --> 00:23:59.221
We gotta give her a chance.

677
00:23:59.222 --> 00:23:59.700
We gotta give her a chance.

678
00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:00.000
{\an8}[Davena] No.

679
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.966
We use a language
to talk about people

680
00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:08.000
when it's something we
don't like.

681
00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:09.200
we just go ahead and say it

682
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:11.000
and nobody knows
what we're saying.

683
00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:14.066
That's cool.

684
00:24:17.166 --> 00:24:20.000
It's frustrating because
I want to be involved.

685
00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:21.700
so I wanna do it. too.

686
00:24:23.266 --> 00:24:24.366
[Davena] Oops.

687
00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:25.800
[laughing]

688
00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:27.966
My sisters are being
a little mean and rude.

689
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:29.221
<i>and it makes me really upset.</i>

690
00:24:29.222 --> 00:24:30.000
<i>And it makes me really upset.</i>

691
00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:31.966
[Whitney] I'm gonna go cook.
Wish me luck.

692
00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.800
- [DeeDee] All right.
- [Davena] All right. girl.

693
00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:34.966
[LaQuana] Wish her luck.
Good luck.

694
00:24:34.967 --> 00:24:37.300
- [Whitney] I got this.
- Be nice. She's good.

695
00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:39.266
Like. she really can grill.

696
00:24:42.266 --> 00:24:43.566
[Whitney] One. two. three.
four. five.

697
00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:45.566
six. seven. eight. nine. 10. 11.

698
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.866
We need more.

699
00:24:46.867 --> 00:24:49.566
Babe. you look good
on the grill.

700
00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:50.866
[Davena] Looking on
the grille does not mean

701
00:24:50.867 --> 00:24:53.566
- she can cook though.
- Oh. God.

702
00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:55.100
Whitney cannot grill.

703
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:56.967
- At all.
- Period.

704
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.221
[Whitney] Oh. shoot.

705
00:24:59.222 --> 00:24:59.264
[Whitney] Oh. shoot.

706
00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:00.000
[Davena] She needs some
assistance back there.

707
00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.866
All right. I got this.
I got this.

708
00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:05.100
Oh.

709
00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:07.566
I felt so much pressure like
I have to cook well

710
00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:09.265
because I have to impress
them and I have to

711
00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:11.900
say the right things
or they're not gonna like me.

712
00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:14.000
Oh. these are gonna burn.

713
00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:19.265
It was like awkward
to say the least.

714
00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:23.065
- Everything's okay.
- [laughter]

715
00:25:23.066 --> 00:25:24.600
[DeeDee] She's not okay. guys.

716
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.400
Everything's fine.

717
00:25:27.467 --> 00:25:28.967
[Kailynn] Dad!

718
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.065
{\an8}Oh. you're trying
to knock me over?

719
00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:36.900
{\an8}I'm excited my dad's
at the barbecue today.

720
00:25:36.967 --> 00:25:38.566
but he's gonna eat
all the hot dogs.

721
00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:40.100
[Brooklyn]
<i>He might not be my dad.</i>

722
00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:41.299
{\an8}but he's still my friend.

723
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.165
{\an8}Like. he always sees me.
he's like. "Hey. Brooklyn."

724
00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.266
{\an8}And I'm like. "'Sup."

725
00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:49.366
- [Davena] Who that?
- [LaQuana] Brother.

726
00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:50.766
[DeeDee] Will in the house.

727
00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:52.366
Sexy chocolate.

728
00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:54.466
It's okay. Just put this here.

729
00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:55.666
All right.
I need you to start grilling.

730
00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:56.567
[DeeDee] I got you.

731
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.221
I love Will and I was pissed

732
00:25:59.222 --> 00:25:59.667
I love Will and I was pissed

733
00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:00.000
when DeeDee left Will.
like. pissed.

734
00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:04.265
At the top of pissosity.

735
00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:05.366
I think she had a thing for W's?

736
00:26:05.367 --> 00:26:06.500
[gasps]

737
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.600
Weird and weirdoes.

738
00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:08.600
[laughter]

739
00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.265
Weird and weirdest.

740
00:26:10.266 --> 00:26:12.265
Okay. I'm done.

741
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.265
[Whitney sighs]

742
00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:16.165
Something smells like
it's burning.

743
00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.532
[Davena] Because DeeDee
not cooking.

744
00:26:17.533 --> 00:26:19.265
- [Will] Oh. snap.
- But Whitney's trying to impress us. though.

745
00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:20.500
I think she's trying
to impress us.

746
00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:22.600
but you definitely
the cook-cook for real.

747
00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:24.300
- Check with our Will.
- [LaQuana] Yes.

748
00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:25.367
[laughs]

749
00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:28.166
What up. Will?

750
00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:29.221
Hey. what's happening?

751
00:26:29.222 --> 00:26:29.467
Hey. what's happening?

752
00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:30.000
[DeeDee] <i>Will and Whitney.</i>
<i>it just depends on the day.</i>

753
00:26:31.667 --> 00:26:35.400
He does like her
75 percent of the time.

754
00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:38.265
the 25 percent. he's angry.
he's bitter.

755
00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:40.467
and he feels
like she stole us away.

756
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.000
Oh. my gosh.

757
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.266
Okay. Just stay.

758
00:26:57.066 --> 00:26:59.165
[DeeDee] Hey. guys.
the food is ready.

759
00:26:59.166 --> 00:26:59.220
- [laughter]
- [Davena] Food is ready.

760
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.000
- [laughter]
- [Davena] Food is ready.

761
00:27:00.467 --> 00:27:01.600
[Whitney] Let's go.

762
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.366
I'm coming.

763
00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:05.400
[DeeDee] All right. y'all.

764
00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:07.065
Let's eat.

765
00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:09.000
Yum.

766
00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:11.000
Eat. eat. eat. eat.

767
00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:12.366
We need some buns. too.

768
00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:14.366
I'm not like a maid or anything.

769
00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:15.900
so. like. we can
come and get it.

770
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:19.300
I gave you kids.
give me a bun. please.

771
00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:21.300
[laughter]

772
00:27:21.367 --> 00:27:23.000
- [Davena] He gave you a...
- That's not even funny.

773
00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:24.666
[laughs]

774
00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:26.165
He can say whatever he want

775
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.165
because he did
give DeeDee these kids.

776
00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.221
And did.

777
00:27:29.222 --> 00:27:29.300
And did.

778
00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:30.000
That's facts.

779
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.165
- How do you feel?
- If I had to say that though.

780
00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:35.766
- That was very annoying.
- Its Will.

781
00:27:35.767 --> 00:27:36.900
- That's him.
- You're right.

782
00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:38.066
I do miss my family.

783
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.366
<i>Same one with my kids.</i>

784
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:41.900
to tell you the truth
I don't like it.

785
00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:45.066
<i>because it's what
I used to have.</i>

786
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.566
- [sighs]
- Breathe.

787
00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:55.065
We did make it.

788
00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:58.100
{\an8}Thanks for doing with.
uh. with me.

789
00:27:58.166 --> 00:27:59.221
- Where?
- Get it out. Get it out.

790
00:27:59.222 --> 00:28:00.000
- Where?
- Get it out. Get it out.

791
00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:02.666
[laughs]

792
00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:04.400
Sorry. guys.

793
00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:14.100
One. two. three.
four. five. six.

794
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:16.265
Five. seven. eight. nine.
let's go.

795
00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:18.366
Let's go!

796
00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:19.566
{\an8}Where are we going?

797
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:20.567
{\an8}We're gonna look
at some wedding dresses.

798
00:28:20.568 --> 00:28:22.366
We're gonna go wedding
dress shopping.

799
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.766
- Oh.
- We are?

800
00:28:23.767 --> 00:28:24.866
[DeeDee] Yeah.

801
00:28:24.867 --> 00:28:26.566
[Whitney] <i>I was ready</i>
<i>to propose to DeeDee</i>

802
00:28:26.567 --> 00:28:29.221
the day that I asked her
to be my girlfriend.

803
00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:29.567
the day that I asked her
to be my girlfriend.

804
00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:30.000
but she would've said no.

805
00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:31.800
- so...
- She's serious.

806
00:28:31.867 --> 00:28:32.966
I decided to wait.

807
00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:35.566
Um. but when I got to a point
where I was really.

808
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:38.165
<i>like. I want this girl
and I wanna show her</i>

809
00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:40.300
<i>that I am devoted to her.</i>

810
00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:43.099
<i>I decided to put a ring
on her finger.</i>

811
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.065
Yes. babe. of course.

812
00:28:45.066 --> 00:28:47.100
Just to kind of symbolize. like.

813
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:49.566
you are mine and I am...
My eyes are nowhere else.

814
00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:51.165
like you are exactly what I want

815
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.400
and I'm dedicating
my heart to you.

816
00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.066
{\an8}[Whitney] Yes.

817
00:28:58.066 --> 00:28:59.221
- A pink one?
- A pink dress?

818
00:28:59.222 --> 00:28:59.467
- A pink one?
- A pink dress?

819
00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:00.000
- [Whitney] Oh.
- Hmm.

820
00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:03.667
{\an8}[Whitney] That's an idea.

821
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.466
{\an8}[Dee and Whitney] Aw.

822
00:29:07.467 --> 00:29:12.600
I really want a wedding
like emerald green. um. dress.

823
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:14.300
And then mommy. what do you
guys think about like

824
00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.700
a black dress on mommy?

825
00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:17.366
- I think--
- Yes.

826
00:29:17.367 --> 00:29:19.265
{\an8}You think I'm gonna be pretty?

827
00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:22.265
{\an8}- A demon?
- Oh. my goodness.

828
00:29:22.266 --> 00:29:24.466
[Whitney] <i>We have a lot</i>
<i>of stuff to do.</i>

829
00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:26.566
So much planning
and I'm a planner.

830
00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:29.221
so I wanna know everything
and it's like every detail.

831
00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:29.700
So I wanna know everything
and it's like every detail.

832
00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:30.000
Babe. I'm. like. nervous
to see your sisters.

833
00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:36.367
You're gonna be all right.

834
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.866
<i>Ever since I got with Whitney.</i>

835
00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:42.466
<i>things have been really
tough with me and my sisters.</i>

836
00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:45.165
I invited my sisters today
because I honestly

837
00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:46.766
don't see myself
doing this without them.

838
00:29:46.767 --> 00:29:49.466
But this is my girl.
so they're gonna have

839
00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:51.666
to just learn how to just accept

840
00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:53.567
<i>who I'm with and how she is.</i>

841
00:29:57.467 --> 00:29:58.666
{\an8}[all] <i>Coming up...</i>

842
00:29:58.667 --> 00:29:59.222
Never had a family bond.
I've never had a sister.

843
00:29:59.222 --> 00:30:00.000
Never had a family bond.
I've never had a sister.

844
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.666
[DeeDee] Now. I feel like. um.
I have to choose.

845
00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:06.600
But I don't wanna feel like
I have to choose.

846
00:30:06.667 --> 00:30:08.066
We're gonna need
an intervention.

847

{\an8}[woman laughing]

848

Oh. my goodness.

855
00:30:30.567 --> 00:30:32.265
{\an8}I've never been
to a colorful wedding.

856
00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:33.800
{\an8}All the weddings
I've ever been to

857
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:34.900
{\an8}- were just white.
- White.

858
00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:37.366
Mommy. look. there's these two.

859
00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:38.666
- They're ready.
- They're the bosses.

860
00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:40.466
They are ready.

861
00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:42.666
{\an8}[DeeDee] You got a surprise
for me?

862
00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:44.561
{\an8}Oh. thank you.

863
00:30:44.562 --> 00:30:44.667
{\an8}Oh. thank you.

864
00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:45.000
{\an8}Lesbian weddings are hard.

865
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.000
{\an8}It's like. who walks the other
person down the aisle?

866
00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:51.800
I don't know how it all works.

867
00:30:51.867 --> 00:30:54.099
What kind of dress is she gonna
wear versus what I'm gonna wear?

868
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.800
Are we gonna clash?

869
00:30:55.867 --> 00:30:57.366
You like that one?
The sparkles?

870
00:30:57.367 --> 00:30:58.866
- Um. mommy--
- [Kailynn] You guys are gonna

871
00:30:58.867 --> 00:30:59.900
- try these on?
- [Whitney] Oh. that's pretty.

872
00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:01.666
And how about this one?

873
00:31:01.667 --> 00:31:03.800
- Oh. yeah.
- [Kailynn] Oh. yeah.

874
00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:05.666
She wants a horse-drawn
carriage.

875
00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:09.065
a harp player.
and she wants a peacock.

876
00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:11.566
Like. she just goes crazy.
it makes no sense.

877
00:31:11.567 --> 00:31:13.400
<i>And we're both very femme.</i>

878
00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:14.561
like we are definitely
the stereotype

879
00:31:14.562 --> 00:31:15.000
like we are definitely
the stereotype

880
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:17.065
of a femme lesbian.

881
00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:19.766
So I'm like we both want
to have pretty diamond rings.

882
00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:21.900
we both want that experience.

883
00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:23.900
So those colors together...

884
00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:25.400
[DeeDee] But she can't see
my dress though.

885
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.266
- I'm not gonna say yes.
- [girl] Mommy. Mommy.

886
00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.967
I think that fits me
pretty well. actually.

887
00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:36.300
- [woman] Hello.
- [LaQuana] Hey. girl. hey.

888
00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:37.566
- Hi.
- [LaQuana] Hey. Brooklyn.

889
00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:38.666
Hey. KK.

890
00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:39.866
[DeeDee]
I'm glad y'all made it.

891
00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:42.500
Bring it in.
Bring it in. girl.

892
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:44.560
[LaQuana] Brooklyn.

893
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:45.000
[LaQuana] Brooklyn.

894
00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:50.566
Hey. little man.
Don't do me like this.

895
00:31:50.567 --> 00:31:51.999
Give me my hug.

896
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.100
[LaQuana] Brennan.

897
00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:55.766
Why aren't they saying hi to me?

898
00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:57.600
What is that? A cactus?
Are you a cactus?

899
00:31:57.667 --> 00:31:58.800
[laughter]

900
00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:00.866
[Whitney] <i>It feels so awkward.</i>

901
00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:02.466
<i>But LaQuana and Davena</i>

902
00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:04.400
are very important to DeeDee.

903
00:32:04.467 --> 00:32:06.566
so I have to make this work.

904
00:32:06.567 --> 00:32:08.466
- [girl] Come on.
- [Whitney] Hey. guys.

905
00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:10.400
If you hear me. clap once.

906
00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:12.666
Brennan. you just sit over here.

907
00:32:12.667 --> 00:32:14.400
Me and mommy are gonna go
and get fitted

908
00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:14.560
to see what sizes we are.

909
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:15.000
To see what sizes we are.

910
00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.767
Beckham. on the floor. really?

911
00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:20.866
{\an8}They met.
they were then friends.

912
00:32:20.867 --> 00:32:22.400
Then the ring.

913
00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:24.466
- Then the other thing.
- And then the other ring.

914
00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:26.766
[Davena] <i>It was just like</i>
<i>friend. friend. dating.</i>

915
00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:30.165
kids. dogs. cats.
rabbits. engaged.

916
00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:31.666
[LaQuana] <i>It was just a lot.</i>

917
00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:33.366
<i>A lot at one time just...</i>

918
00:32:33.367 --> 00:32:35.467
It's a lot at one time.

919
00:32:35.967 --> 00:32:37.099
It's too much.

920
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.600
These are like my dream
color scheme.

921
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:43.466
[DeeDee] <i>When I told my sisters
I wanted to propose to Whitney.</i>

922
00:32:43.467 --> 00:32:44.561
<i>they was like. "Are you sure?"
They're asking so many questions.</i>

923
00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:45.000
<i>They was like. "Are you sure?"
They're asking so many questions.</i>

924
00:32:45.867 --> 00:32:48.600
They thought that she
was trying to take their spot.

925
00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:50.065
Uh. that's what I feel
like they think.

926
00:32:50.066 --> 00:32:52.366
I cannot be this excited.
right? Right?

927
00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:54.366
Right. No. you should be
this excited.

928
00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.800
[Whitney] Okay.

929
00:32:55.867 --> 00:32:57.600
All right. Whitney and DeeDee.
we're gonna go ahead

930
00:32:57.667 --> 00:32:58.667
- and get started.
- [both] Okay.

931
00:32:58.668 --> 00:33:00.165
Is there any of the outfits
you found?

932
00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:01.500
I really like this one.

933
00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:03.165
Babe. I just picked that one.

934
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.500
Well. you guys
both can try it on.

935
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.366
Like in a lesbian wedding.
can you wear the same dress?

936
00:33:07.367 --> 00:33:08.766
Is that. like. acceptable?

937
00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:10.466
I think it's your wedding

938
00:33:10.467 --> 00:33:12.165
and if you both wanna wear
the same dress.

939
00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:13.999
and there's always
different ways you can style.

940
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.562
Are you gonna try
and pick up my dress?

941
00:33:14.562 --> 00:33:15.000
Are you gonna try
and pick up my dress?

942
00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:16.566
I mean...

943
00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:19.100
You didn't pick it up.
I will try it on first.

944
00:33:20.567 --> 00:33:23.666
{\an8}I haven't had a lesbian couple
book the same appointment

945
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.000
{\an8}<i>and come together
at the same time before.</i>

946
00:33:26.066 --> 00:33:27.700
Simon says.

947
00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:29.867
everybody come to the circle
and grab hands.

948
00:33:32.066 --> 00:33:34.200
- I need help.
- [woman] I got you.

949
00:33:34.266 --> 00:33:36.000
Usually. she would help me.
but she can't.

950
00:33:36.066 --> 00:33:37.066
Not today.

951
00:33:37.067 --> 00:33:38.866
[LaQuana] Touch your head.

952
00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:40.900
I didn't say. "Simon Says."

953
00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:43.966
- Hey.
- Hey.

954
00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:44.562
I just wanna know
what's taking them so long.

955
00:33:44.562 --> 00:33:45.000
I just wanna know
what's taking them so long.

956
00:33:46.266 --> 00:33:49.000
[Whitney] Three. two. one.

957
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.766
Oh. my gosh. Can I guess?

958
00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:53.600
Like. what color
are you wearing?

959
00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:54.866
Purple.

960
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:56.566
I know that's a lie.

961
00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.766
Let's go. So we can see
these dresses.

962
00:33:58.767 --> 00:34:00.866
So I really wanna go
show my sisters.

963
00:34:00.867 --> 00:34:03.000
I don't wanna show you.
because I'm really obsessed

964
00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:04.566
- with this dress.
- [Whitney] Okay. babe.

965
00:34:04.567 --> 00:34:05.866
I'm gonna close my curtain.

966
00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:07.000
so I can't see you.

967
00:34:08.567 --> 00:34:09.966
Hey. guys.
you're closing your eyes?

968
00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:11.766
Okay. everybody.
close your eyes.

969
00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:13.600
[DeeDee] All right.
I'm coming.

970
00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:14.562
Don't peek yet.

971
00:34:14.562 --> 00:34:14.800
Don't peek yet.

972
00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:18.200
All right. Y'all can open.

973
00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:21.065
- [screaming]
- [DeeDee] Are you okay?

974
00:34:21.066 --> 00:34:24.200
- You wanna give me a hug?
- You look pretty.

975
00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:27.000
[DeeDee] I love it a lot.
like a lot. a lot.

976
00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:30.200
So what do you all think?
A ten. a five?

977
00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:34.400
- It's a... It's a nine. 9.5.
- [DeeDee] It's a nine?

978
00:34:34.467 --> 00:34:36.900
You like it? You like that?

979
00:34:36.967 --> 00:34:38.400
You just need to see
more dresses.

980
00:34:38.467 --> 00:34:41.000
Okay. All right. I'll be back.

981
00:34:41.066 --> 00:34:42.666
{\an8}I want rainbow dress

982
00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:44.561
{\an8}and I want rainbow wedding.

983
00:34:44.562 --> 00:34:45.000
{\an8}And I want rainbow wedding.

984
00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:49.000
{\an8}Uh. rainbow.

985
00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:50.766
<i>If I wear a rainbow shirt.</i>

986
00:34:50.767 --> 00:34:53.900
it will show that my moms
are in love.

987
00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:55.766
Okay. guys.
Are your eyes closed?

988
00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:56.767
[all] Yes.

989
00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:59.066
Okay. don't open them.
Not yet.

990
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.866
Three. two. one.

991
00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:04.867
[indistinct chatter]

992
00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:08.165
It's a no for 500. Alex.

993
00:35:08.166 --> 00:35:09.300
Strong no.

994
00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:11.367
It's a no for me.

995
00:35:14.367 --> 00:35:14.562
You got the same face.
[laughs]

996
00:35:14.562 --> 00:35:15.000
You got the same face.
[laughs]

997
00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:18.666
No. it's a no.

998
00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:20.000
[LaQuana] That's not the one.

999
00:35:20.066 --> 00:35:21.867
No. it's not the one.

1000
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.265
[sighs]

1001
00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:30.300
[Whitney] <i>Seeing the way that
DeeDee's sisters feel about me</i>

1002
00:35:30.367 --> 00:35:32.099
is very. very hurtful.

1003
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.300
I like the back.
The back is beautiful.

1004
00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:38.600
I'm also kind of bummed
that my family isn't here.

1005
00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:40.866
They just don't wanna be around

1006
00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.666
and it's sad.

1007
00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:44.562
[LaQuana] I don't like
that outfit. No.

1008
00:35:44.562 --> 00:35:45.000
[LaQuana] I don't like
that outfit. No.

{\an8}[insects chirping]

1010
00:35:57.266 --> 00:35:58.900
[DeeDee] It was a little weird
going today.

1011
00:35:58.967 --> 00:36:00.366
Something about my sisters
just like...

1012
00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:02.566
When I'm talking to them.
when I see them.

1013
00:36:02.567 --> 00:36:04.367
when we have conflict. I just...

1014
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.666
- Puts me here.
- I get it.

1015
00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:09.366
My sisters are being
a little mean and rude.

1016
00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:11.200
<i>When it's all said and done.</i>

1017
00:36:11.266 --> 00:36:13.766
they are my sisters.
but I love Whitney.

<i>She's not going nowhere.</i>

1020
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.099
We're gonna need
an intervention.

1021
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.900
There has to be
that back and forth

1022
00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:22.900
or. you know... Nothing's gonna
come out of that other than hurt.

1023
00:36:22.967 --> 00:36:26.099
This is not
how a healthy communication.

1024
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.866
conversation should go.

1025
00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:29.866
And I don't wanna freaking cry.

1026
00:36:29.867 --> 00:36:31.065
It's not about me.

1027
00:36:31.066 --> 00:36:32.900
That's the hardest part
in all of this. is I feel like

1028
00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:36.866
I'm not supposed to be able
to hurt in this situation

1029
00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:39.999
because this is your sister
and your family.

1030
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.200
[DeeDee] I don't know
if they're intimidated

1031
00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:43.766
or they think that you're
trying to break us apart.

1032
00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:44.562
I see your side.
I see your heart.

1033
00:36:44.562 --> 00:36:45.000
I see your side.
I see your heart.

1034
00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:48.099
I know where you're coming
from when you do things.

1035
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.666
And now I feel like.
um. I have to choose.

1036
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:52.165
and if I have to choose.
like you're the person

1037
00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.900
I wanna be with forever.

1038
00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:55.099
But I don't wanna feel like
I have to choose.

1039
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.966
I want you and I want them.

1040
00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:00.200
Like. I do understand why.
like. it's okay to cry

1041
00:37:00.266 --> 00:37:01.466
and be upset about it.

1042
00:37:01.467 --> 00:37:05.466
I've never had a family bond.
I've never had a sister.

1043
00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:07.866
I've never had
a close relationship

1044
00:37:07.867 --> 00:37:11.165
like that. and... Sorry.

1045
00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:13.800
To see what you had with them.

1046
00:37:13.867 --> 00:37:14.562
I've never had nieces
or nephews.

1047
00:37:14.562 --> 00:37:15.000
I've never had nieces
or nephews.

1048
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:18.100
And I chose you.

1049
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:20.265
I chose your children.

1050
00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:23.600
I chose your sisters.
I chose your family.

1051
00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:26.300
And it's hard.

1052
00:37:30.266 --> 00:37:31.866
{\an8}[all] <i>Coming up...</i>

1053
00:37:31.867 --> 00:37:34.366
{\an8}I swear I feel like you just
like push us to the sidelines.

1054
00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:36.966
Whitney is swallowing DeeDee.
She needs to give

1055
00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:38.265
- her time to breathe.
- Yes.

1056
00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:40.265
You treat us
as if we're not your sisters

1057
00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:42.466
when you can just. you know.
dispose of us when you want to.

1058
00:37:42.467 --> 00:37:44.561
- No. we're not down with that.
- I feel attacked.

1059
00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:45.000
- No. we're not down with that.
- I feel attacked.

1060
00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:55.666
[Davena] Because my feet
look a hot mess.

1061
00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:58.266
You're a magician.
Do your thing. do your thing.

1062
00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:02.099
{\an8}Girl. are you ready to have
this conversation?

1063
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.300
{\an8}- No.
- Hmm.

1064
00:38:04.367 --> 00:38:06.165
I just want her to understand
how we feel.

1065
00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:09.566
I just think we just need to figure
it out from here because we can't

1066
00:38:09.567 --> 00:38:11.300
- continue to...
- No.

1067
00:38:11.367 --> 00:38:12.467
Be going this path
that we're going.

1068
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.265
This shouldn't be continued.
That's the difference.

1069
00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:16.300
Like I said. this is just to
address the elephant in the...

1070
00:38:16.367 --> 00:38:19.057
- in the room and move on.
- And she's the elephant.

1071
00:38:19.058 --> 00:38:19.200
- In the room and move on.
- And she's the elephant.

1072
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.999
[DeeDee] <i>I wanted to invite</i>
<i>my sisters to the nail salon</i>

1073
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.600
{\an8}because despite all my efforts.

1074
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.366
they're still not being
respectful to Whitney.

1075
00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:28.666
and it is very important
that my sisters

1076
00:38:28.667 --> 00:38:32.099
<i>are involved in my life. stay in
my life. and be a part of my life.</i>

1077
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.099
But we need to get everything
out on the table.

1078
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.766
I just want her
to understand sisterhood.

1079
00:38:37.767 --> 00:38:40.366
because when you have sisters.
it's supposed to be important. so...

1080
00:38:40.367 --> 00:38:42.800
DeeDee can't separate her
relationship with her family

1081
00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.400
and then from her girlfriend.

1082
00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.466
That's our biggest issue
with her. separate them.

1083
00:38:46.467 --> 00:38:48.200
Also because we don't have
mommies. so I feel like

1084
00:38:48.266 --> 00:38:49.058
why wouldn't you keep
that bond between us?

1085
00:38:49.058 --> 00:38:50.000
Why wouldn't you keep
that bond between us?

1086
00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:53.099
We're sisters first.
You have to be sisters first.

1087
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.500
Like. we're all we have.

1088
00:38:57.467 --> 00:38:59.165
- Hey.
- [DeeDee] I'mma sit here.

1089
00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:01.099
{\an8}- [woman speaking]
- Right here?

1090
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.300
{\an8}[woman speaking]

1091
00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:04.500
{\an8}- [DeeDee] Thank you.
- [woman speaking]

1092
00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:13.500
Seems like it's the elephant
in the room.

1093
00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:15.200
Just a little bit...

1094
00:39:15.266 --> 00:39:16.400
[laughs]

1095
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.700
I'm trying.

1096
00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:19.058
I feel like I'm in
a horror movie right now.

1097
00:39:19.058 --> 00:39:20.000
I feel like I'm in
a horror movie right now.

1098
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.500
- [imitate evil laugh]
- I hate that noise.

1099
00:39:24.567 --> 00:39:27.466
The problem is
you're dating a female. right?

1100
00:39:27.467 --> 00:39:30.566
Because it's two females.
we're getting confused with...

1101
00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:33.366
- Yeah. I agree.
- Partners and sisters.

1102
00:39:33.367 --> 00:39:35.300
Every time you get around...
You got with her.

1103
00:39:35.367 --> 00:39:38.100
I swear I feel like you just.
like. push us to the sidelines.

1104
00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:41.666
Since you got with her.
I don't even have a.

1105
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:43.466
"Hey. girl. let's hang out."

1106
00:39:43.467 --> 00:39:46.165
That's not her fault. though.

1107
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.466
To me. it seems like it's
Whitney not allowing DeeDee

1108
00:39:48.467 --> 00:39:49.058
to be free or be
with her family.

1109
00:39:49.058 --> 00:39:50.000
To be free or be
with her family.

1110
00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:52.466
Whitney is swallowing DeeDee.

1111
00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:54.366
She needs to give her
time to breathe.

1112
00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:55.666
Yes. That space.

1113
00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:58.165
I just feel like
I'm getting older

1114
00:39:58.166 --> 00:39:59.500
and I'm doing things different.

1115
00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:01.165
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

1116
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:03.400
I'm not... That's not my
issue. I'm not knocking that.

1117
00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:05.300
But you can't get older
and do things different

1118
00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:07.165
and push us to the side.

1119
00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:08.767
That doesn't make sense to me.
It doesn't add up.

1120
00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.065
{\an8}- Like. she is trying.
- That has nothing to do

1121
00:40:13.066 --> 00:40:15.065
with us.
That's your household.

1122
00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:17.566
But I just feel like I don't
have y'all to kind of vent to.

1123
00:40:17.567 --> 00:40:19.057
like. I went to my safe place.

1124
00:40:19.058 --> 00:40:19.300
Like. I went to my safe place.

1125
00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:20.000
Y'all was my safe place
and y'all took that way.

1126
00:40:21.166 --> 00:40:23.866
We wanna build
our relationship with you.

1127
00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:25.466
- we have issues with her.
- But I'm okay with that. too.

1128
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:27.000
I still wanna protect her.

1129
00:40:27.066 --> 00:40:28.666
I don't want her to be
looking at as being crazy.

1130
00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:30.300
- She's not.
- So that's what I'm saying.

1131
00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:32.165
this whole victim part
and then you get upset

1132
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:33.466
- what we're saying.
- [DeeDee] I never tried

1133
00:40:33.467 --> 00:40:35.000
to play the victim. I'm just
telling you how I'm feeling.

1134
00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:36.399
You always got something to say

1135
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.300
- and every time I talk-- - So
you don't think that's victim?

1136
00:40:38.367 --> 00:40:40.766
Well. I feel a victim because
you're always attacking me.

1137
00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:42.400
Y'all do it at the same time.

1138
00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:43.566
Girl...

1139
00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:44.766
I'm not attacking you...

1140
00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:46.266
I feel attacked.

1141
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.566
You are not attached by
the umbilical cord to that girl.

1142
00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:54.099
You are my sibling.

1143
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.566
- She brings me happiness.
- And... But we don't?

1144
00:40:56.567 --> 00:40:58.300
I enjoy being around her.

1145
00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:02.566
{\an8}- That's the problem.
- That's the problem.

1146
00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:04.566
- She threw herself at us.
- Right. we know.

1147
00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:06.165
Like. "Oh. I want...
I always want a sister."

1148
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:07.466
Okay. well. we have
enough of us.

1149
00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:09.566
You treat us as if
we're not your sisters.

1150
00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.466
We just like your home girls
and you can just.

1151
00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:12.700
you know. dispose of us
when you want to.

1152
00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:13.767
No. we're not down with that.

1153
00:41:13.768 --> 00:41:15.566
[LaQuana]
How can we move forward?

1154
00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:16.567
What's next?

1155
00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:18.666
We was a puzzle.

1156
00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:19.058
The puzzle done broke up
into pieces.

1157
00:41:19.058 --> 00:41:20.000
The puzzle done broke up
into pieces.

1158
00:41:20.166 --> 00:41:21.566
[Davena]
We lost one of the pieces.

1159
00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:22.966
Now we have to put
the puzzle back together.

1160
00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:24.400
It's baby steps. baby steps.

1161
00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:26.065
We got to work on baby step.

1162
00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:28.366
So the first step we're trying
to make right now.

1163
00:41:28.367 --> 00:41:31.300
- DeeDee. is being your sister.
- [Davena] Your sister.

1164
00:41:31.367 --> 00:41:34.065
And then once we start
getting us together.

1165
00:41:34.066 --> 00:41:35.466
once we're right.

1166
00:41:35.467 --> 00:41:37.265
everything else
will fall into place.

1167
00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:40.766
We just wanted to try to work
on our sisterhood

1168
00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:43.200
and try to build
a relationship back with her.

1169
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.500
So are we done?

1170
00:41:45.567 --> 00:41:47.366
Are we gonna work
on our relationship?

1171
00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:49.057
Are we gonna try to put the
pieces back together slowly?

1172
00:41:49.058 --> 00:41:50.000
Are we gonna try to put the
pieces back together slowly?

1173
00:41:50.166 --> 00:41:51.666
I'm willing to work
on our relationship.

1174
00:41:51.667 --> 00:41:54.165
I just really want us to.

1175
00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:56.500
like. be aware of what
we're doing to each other.

1176
00:41:56.567 --> 00:41:58.666
- To me. that's it.
- Okay.

1177
00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:00.666
[Davena] <i>I'm just crawling
to see where we get to.</i>

1178
00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:02.165
I mean. I could see
as only going up.

1179
00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:03.366
because we already been down.

1180
00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:05.466
We're gonna hug it out.
Is that what we're gonna do?

1181
00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:07.265
[sighs] Okay.

1182
00:42:07.266 --> 00:42:09.466
I know they still have
reservations about her.

1183
00:42:09.467 --> 00:42:11.666
but Whitney is going
to be my wife.

1184
00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:13.666
So they're just gonna have
