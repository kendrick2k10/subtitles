Five years earlier. we lost
the air force base here

an enormous impact

133
00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:27.949
It was akin
to economic Armageddon

"Let's go to Woodstock."

was next in line

175
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.490

at the time wanted to go. too.

was that

the fact that the sweater
I had on didn't have sleeves

like a thousand transports

847
00:38:53.282 --> 00:38:55.407
and a lot of them
were just dehydrations

848

enough water that day.

I would say 90 percent
of the cases that we saw

with the vendors all the water
had to be sold

858
00:39:25.282 --> 00:39:27.157
for four dollars a bottle.

I would choose the beer. too.

JAKE HAFNER: In 1999.
I was 23 years old.

876
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.657
and a good friend of mine
called me up one day

877
00:40:12.741 --> 00:40:15.866
and asked me if I wanted
to work security

878
00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:18.073
at Woodstock '99.

879
00:40:18.157 --> 00:40:21.782
JOHN: The security was hard
to hire. They're a lot of them.

880
00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:23.615
And we had to get licensed ones.

881
00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:26.449
which. you know.
was not that easy.

882
00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:28.949
JAKE: They had
a three-hour class I had to take

883
00:40:29.032 --> 00:40:31.574
and the instructor
basically spent

884
00:40:31.657 --> 00:40:33.365
the last two hours of the class

885
00:40:33.449 --> 00:40:36.282

and then at the end of that.

887

then he handed out the test
and we took it.

to be a security guard
at Woodstock '99.

891
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.073
JOHN: At the gates. we had
our most trusted security guys.

892
00:40:56.157 --> 00:40:58.365
So if somebody was trying
to take money.

893
00:40:58.449 --> 00:41:00.407
it would have got caught.

894
00:41:01.073 --> 00:41:02.824
And with drinking water.

895
00:41:02.907 --> 00:41:06.157

JOHN: Yes. bottles of water
were four dollars.

It was somewhat
on the high side.

902
00:41:22.157 --> 00:41:25.532
but it wasn't as ridiculous
as it got made out to be

that time in our life
where the idealistic view

1099

was crushed and crumbled.

1100
00:50:19.115 --> 00:50:22.073
And then. the nu metal.
took it a step further

1101
00:50:22.157 --> 00:50:24.240
with its angst. this aggression.

to sort of exhaust that energy

provided the perfect vehicle

you just have to be
