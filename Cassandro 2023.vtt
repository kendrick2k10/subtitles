You're going bald.

717
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.541
Don't even say it.

718
00:53:02.625 --> 00:53:05.000
No. don't say it!

719
00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:09.750
When we get this house.
I'll make it a heart-shaped pool.

720
00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:11.416
-Like a heart?
-Yeah.

721
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.750
Why?

722
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:16.958
Just because. Just to be faggy.

723
00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:19.041
(both laughing)

724
00:53:20.416 --> 00:53:22.083
Oh. son.

725
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.958
(song continues)

726
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.583
(in English):
It's beautiful.

727
00:53:43.666 --> 00:53:45.333
It's got a yellow kitchen.

00:53:45.416 --> 00:53:47.416
(song ends)

729
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.666

731
00:54:02.333 --> 00:54:05.000

732
00:54:05.083 --> 00:54:07.166
(laughing):
No.

733
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.666

Oh!

734
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.666
It sounds like a story.

735
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.500
Oh. no. there's nothing much to tell. no.

736
00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.416
Yeah. I don't believe that.

737
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.958
SAÚL:
Mm.

738
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:21.750
So...

739
00:54:21.833 --> 00:54:26.250
my mom met him at a party when she was...

740
00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:27.666
she was very young.

741
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:32.375
And. um. and they started
to have an affair. instantly.

742
00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:34.583
-That lasted years.
-(chuckles)

743
00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:37.166
But he had a wife.

744
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.333
Oh.

745
00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:41.666
(laughs):
And then he had many kids.

746
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.416
(chuckles):
Oof.

747
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.875
My mom was so in love with him.
I think she still is.

748
00:54:48.958 --> 00:54:52.625
-So you-you knew him?
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

749
00:54:52.708 --> 00:54:54.416
Yeah.

750
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.250
Yeah. he introduced me to lucha libre.

751
00:54:57.333 --> 00:54:59.916
-Took me to a few matches.
-Mm.

752
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.333
You don't... you don't see him no more?

753
00:55:08.208 --> 00:55:11.500
-No. not for a while.
-Mm.

754
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:16.333
I came out when I was 15.

755
00:55:20.916 --> 00:55:23.000
And he's very...

756
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:27.958
He's a lot into Jesus.

757
00:55:32.291 --> 00:55:34.708

-So. that's how it is?

in the world of lucha libre.

Well...

1206
01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:07.000
For me... my greatest source of
inspiration are women.

1207
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.625
I was raised by women.

1208
01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:15.916
Women have helped me learn
who I want to be.

1209
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.625
where I want to go. and where I come from.

1210

1212

What's your secret?

1219
01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:59.000

Just being me.

1220

1222
01:34:04.791 --> 01:34:09.750
I have the pleasure to announce
we're launching a world tour.

1223
01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:11.166

wrestling everywhere

1224

1227

Cassandro. if you allow me.
I would like to pass the mic

1228
01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:27.041
to a young man who has a message for you.

1229
01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:28.500
-Of course.
-Shall we?

1230
01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:31.833
-Yes. where is he?
-Right here. in front of us.

1231
01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:36.708
Cassandro. it's a dream come true
to talk to you in person.

1232
01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:42.166
I've seen all your fights
on the Saturday shows.

1233
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:45.166
and I've seen you live
five different times.

1234
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:49.458
I also collect your merch.
including your action figure.

1235

I came out to my father.

1237

I told him. and he...

1238
01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:09.166

He's here with me tonight.
