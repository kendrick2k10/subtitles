The sun is shining.

Everybody'’s out there
having fun. socializing.

62
00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:50.839
Yeah. makes you wanna
get out there
and join '’em. doesn'’t it?

63
00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:52.449
It sure does.

64
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:54.016
Uh-huh.

65
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.757
- Well. I'’ll see ya.
- Hooray!

66
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:02.329
Armen. what are you doing?

67
00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:03.765
Just a little
spring-cleaning.

68
00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.984
Come on.
We did spring.

69
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:09.379
Oh. no. not this spring.
No. no. Next spring.
You know. it keeps recurring.

70
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:11.207
You know.
I just like to get an early--

71
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.427
Hey. wait. Anemone.
Give it back.

72
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.342
I can'’t do that. man.

73
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.170
For somethin'’ so tiny.
you really take up
a lot of space.

74
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.651
Hey. Wait.
Was that necessary?

75
00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:24.133
If I had known my roommate
was gonna be
such a stick-in-the-mud.

76
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:25.874
I never would have moved in.

77
00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.746
What are you talking about?
We'’re thriving in here.

78
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.444
I got my bonsai going.

79
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:32.097
- Armen.
- Shh.

80
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.927
Perfect.
You learned a new language. right?

81
00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.583
I picked up a new instrument.

82
00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:41.106
Put it down!

83
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.717
You wanna play
rock paper scissors again?

84
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:45.023
Come on. Rock. pa--That'’s enough already!

85
00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:48.113
Come on. Armen.
It'’s time to face the music.

86
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.290
You just gotta put
yourself out there.

87
00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:53.423
I want to. Anemone.
Believe me.

88
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:55.860
But I'’m not like
these other crabs.
all right?

89
00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:57.645
I don'’t throw
my claws in the air.

90
00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.211
I don'’t wave '’em
like I just don'’t care.

91
00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:01.649
Because I care. Very much.

92
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.173
Yo. Armen!
Hey. what are you doing?

93
00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:06.001
- Where you been?
- Get outta here.

94
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:09.918
Good luck. boys.
I'’m tapping out.

95
00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:12.790
Hey. Bobby.
How'’s it going. you guys?

96
00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:14.314
What up. bro?

97
00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:17.317
He looks so pale.
Get this crab some vitamin D.

98
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:18.883
Let'’s get to work. bro.

99
00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:20.494
Ready to tear it up
this summer or what?

100
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:23.758
It'’s. like. 9:00 in the morning.
but. yeah.

101
00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:26.064
You coming to the club tonight.
Armen? Don'’t say no.

102
00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:28.240
Oh. we gotta get in that club.

103
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.113
What'’s the point of working out
if I can'’t show off
the Condition?

104
00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:32.723
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
The "Condition"?

105
00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:34.899
What is that? Like a rash?

106
00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:37.206
Pfft. No.
It'’s my new nickname. Huh.

107
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.382
Look at them go.
They got a mind of their own.

108
00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:41.863
Look at '’em.
Boom. boom. boom. boom.

109
00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:44.169
I don'’t even want any critiques.
I'’m the Condition.

110
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.650
Maybe you should see a doctor
about that. Jimmy?

111
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:49.566
Oh. come on.
It'’s a great nickname.

112
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.394
It'’s gonna stick.
I'’m telling ya.

113
00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:53.918
Hey.
so you coming to the club
with us or what?

114
00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:56.486
Yeah. you know what?
Maybe I better sit this one out.

115
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.836
Give the rest of you guys
a chance. huh? [chuckles] Oh!

116
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.623
Hey. come on.
I can'’t kick off summer
without my best friend.

117
00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:04.364
It'’s the Jersey Shore. baby!

118
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:08.890
Oh. geez louise. Sea crabs.

119
00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:11.022
There'’s gotta be twice as many
as last summer.

120
00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:13.982
It'’s not fair.
They got the whole ocean.

121
00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:15.766
Unlimited shells.

122
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.681
All the riches of the sea.

123
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.683
They can go
wherever they want.

124
00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:22.033
Why do they gotta come
to our town?

125
00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.123
I'’m just throwing it out there.
but aren'’t you all hermit crabs?

126
00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:28.605
I mean. you'’re crabs.
They'’re crabs.

127
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.694
Maybe you got more in common
than you think?

128
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.217
Oh!

129
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.654
- This guy.
- That is blasphemy.

130
00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:36.221
Are you kidding me?
We got nothing in common.

131
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.267
We live on land.
They live in the sea.

132
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:40.051
They stay out of
the water too long...

133
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.100
I don'’t feel so good.[gasps] Oh. my gosh.

134
00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:52.716
I rest my case.
They'’re imitation crabs.

135
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.065
Namaste.

136
00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:58.374
What'’d he call me?

137
00:06:58.548 --> 00:06:59.549
Didn'’t you read the sign?

138
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:01.377
Locals only.

139
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:03.074
Namaste! Namaste!

140
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:04.772
Take a walk. pal.

141
00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:07.209
I think it'’s time to start
cracking some shells.

142
00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.517
What the--

143
00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.957
Holy Bon Jovi.

144
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:18.786
Bobby. this shell
was made for you. bro.

145
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.615
XXL. Sleek. yet spacious.

146
00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:23.834
Maybe throw a spoiler on it?

147
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:26.663
Oh. couple of jell-EDs
for that underglow.

148
00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:28.186
Save up for hydraulics.

149
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.319
That'’s cool.
It is cool. It is.

150
00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:33.235
Why don'’t you take a test walk.
- Bobby?
- Yeah. baby.

151
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.063
- You know what that means.
- Oh. no.

152
00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:37.195
Vacancy chain!

153
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:38.719
- Vacancy chain?
- Vacancy chain!

154
00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:40.155
Vacancy chain!

155
00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:41.635
- I saved you a spot. bro.
- What?

156
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:43.680
You didn'’t have to do that.

157
00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:46.553
All right.
Who'’s ready to move up a size?

158
00:07:46.727 --> 00:07:48.250
Yeah![crab] Oh. yeah!

159
00:07:48.424 --> 00:07:51.514
Step one.
Grab on to your future shell.

160
00:07:51.688 --> 00:07:53.168
Grab on. bro.

161
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:55.475
Hey. Morning.
Lot of eagerness.
Wow. great energy.

162
00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:58.869
Step two.
Remove your future shell.

163
00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:01.655
Uh. actually. this one
might be a better fit for you.

164
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.528
- Oh!
- Step three. Move in. baby!

165
00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:08.009
The Condish just got an upgrade.

166
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:11.665
Yeah. I'’m gonna do
some damage in this.

167
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:14.189
Come on. Jimmy. You wanna
spar with me? You'’re flinching.
You'’re flinching.

168
00:08:14.363 --> 00:08:16.539
Yeah. this is nice.
Bit tight for me. though.
Moving on.

169
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.323
Look at all these happy faces.
Keep it moving.

170
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.977
Never wipe that smile
off your face... Oh!

171
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:21.413
...promise me.
You look amazing.

172
00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:22.937
That went well.
don'’t you think?

173
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:26.506
Come on. Armen.
That'’s all you.

174
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.073
Uh. you know.
it'’s a little
ostentatious for me.

175
00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:31.380
and I can'’t--
I can'’t leave Anemone.

176
00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:34.165
What?
No. we have lived together
long enough.

177
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:37.647
Will I be sad?
Yes. I will miss you.
But I will get over it.

178
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:39.257
You go on. Get in there!

179
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:40.824
Armen. come on.
You can do it. Get in.

180
00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:42.391
Just take it.

181
00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:44.219
-  Armen!
- Hey. guys. thanks for the offer.

182
00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:46.438
Give it to someone who needs it.
Don'’t waste it on me.

183
00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:48.615
Aw.[sighs] Every time.

184
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:50.704
I don'’t get it.
That shell was butter.

185
00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:52.619
Hey. come on.
Cut him some slack.

186
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:55.230
And after everything
he'’s been through...

187
00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:59.713
Hey. hold-- hold up. Armen.
Armen. hold up.

188
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:01.976
You all right?

189
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.413
You know. my parents
gave me this shell.

190
00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:06.328
It'’s. like.
all I have left of them.

191
00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:08.199
I know. buddy. I know.

192
00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:09.723
Hey. come on. Armen.

193
00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:11.376
You'’re just in a rut.
That'’s all.

194
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.205
You gotta get out of your shell.
buddy. Take a risk.

195
00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:16.904
- Get the blood pumping.
- Yeah. you should pick a fight!

196
00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:20.037
Yo. you wanna start. bro?
You wanna start?

197
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.607
- See?
- Yeah. you should talk
to a girl.

198
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:27.305
- How'’s it going. Denise?
- Drop dead.

199
00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:29.133
See? Just feels good.

200
00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:31.483
Just come to the club tonight.
- okay?
- Why?

201
00:09:31.658 --> 00:09:34.661
So I can stand in the corner
and watch you hit on girls
and get in fights?

202
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:36.793
- Yeah!
- No. forget it. Bobby.

203
00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:38.839
I can'’t do it again this summer.
all right?

204
00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:42.407
I'’m just gonna punch the clock.
Get in. Get out.

205
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.366
Order up.

206
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.237
- I don'’t want any trouble.
- Since when do I
get us in trouble?

207
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:49.197
Bobby Marinara.
this ain'’t your personal buffet!

208
00:09:49.371 --> 00:09:54.028
[sighs] All right. listen up.
All of youse.

209
00:09:54.202 --> 00:09:55.203
Everybody settle down!

210
00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:57.248
Order up.

211
00:09:57.422 --> 00:09:59.120
Not that kind of bell.
That'’s a manager bell.
It'’s my bell.

212
00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:01.905
As I was saying--

213
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.341
Seriously?

214
00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:05.648
What? I slipped.
You try wearing these heels.

215
00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:09.870
Oh. show some respect.
He'’s our manager.

216
00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:11.654
Continue. sir.

217
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.744
Thank you so much
for your permission.
Now. where was I?

218
00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:15.832
- Achoo!
- Bobby!

219
00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:17.355
Sorry. allergies.

220
00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:18.835
I get '’em every summer.

221
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.886
Next one who rings my bell
is fired. You hear me?

222
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.237
Now do not forget
you are the help.

223
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.152
They are the guests.

224
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:35.939
They can be rude. condescending.
call you names. ignore you.

225
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:38.725
And guess what? I don'’t care!

226
00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:41.771
And we do not spit
in their food. Jimmy Romaine.

227
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.123
Just get to work.
you numbskulls.

228
00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:47.690
Get out!

229
00:10:47.864 --> 00:10:49.083
Well!

230
00:10:49.257 --> 00:10:50.780
This isn'’t the only resort.
you know?

231
00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:52.826
I can give you three nights free
if you stay for a week.

232
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.784
Sir? Come back!

233
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.442
To day one. Armen.
A fresh start.
Anything could happen.

234
00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.444
Who knows?
You might even fall in love.

235
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:04.620
Yeah. right.
Like that'’ll ever happen.

236
00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:08.711
We'’re almost there.

237
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.800
Oh. finally.

238
00:11:10.974 --> 00:11:13.368
I can see the surface.

239
00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:18.460
Girls. now stay close.

240
00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:20.288
Yeah. stay close. Shelly.

241
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:21.898
Race you to the top.
Let'’s go!

242
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.467
Oh. these girls are gonna be
the end of me.

243
00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:38.785
Whoo! Oh. that feels so good.

244
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.787
Shelly.

245
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:42.571
Wow.

246
00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:52.102
Whoa!

247
00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:56.324
Dry sand.

248
00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:57.978
Oh. you gonna pay for that.

249
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:03.418
You mind?
Hey. I'’m walking here.

250
00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:05.376
- Hey.
- Hey. hey!

251
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:07.552
Just go around.

252
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.293
What'’s the matter?
Is she deaf?

253
00:12:11.687 --> 00:12:13.558
Yes. she is.

254
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.996
- Huh?
- Hey. how was I
supposed to know?

255
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.084
Yeah.

256
00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:18.955
Land crabs.

257
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:21.262
Girls! What are you doing?

258
00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:22.959
Come on. Mom.

259
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:24.700
Can'’t we just explore
a little before we check in?

260
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:28.748
You know the rules. Ramona.
We do not go past the wet sand.

261
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.753
Now can we please
get to the resort?

262
00:12:33.927 --> 00:12:35.755
Honey.
Mama needs a cocktail.

263
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:42.936
Whoo-hoo!

264
00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:49.246
Care for a spritz?
All right. you'’re welcome.

265
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.074
Oh. yes.
and one for you too.

266
00:12:51.248 --> 00:12:53.250
And you'’re welcome.

267
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:55.470
Ah. I can see it in your eyes.
You want to-- Here you go.

268
00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:57.385
Don'’t mention it.
Not that you were going to.

269
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.303
Hey. no running.
And stay hydrated.

270
00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:03.957
Oh. you were right. Camille.

271
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.350
This place is exactly
what I needed.

272
00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:10.354
Right. Land views?
Spa days for the mums?

273
00:13:10.528 --> 00:13:11.921
Ron'’s at the Clams Casino.

274
00:13:12.095 --> 00:13:13.880
I won'’t have to see him
for a week.

275
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:17.971
So how are things. Val?

276
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:22.453
Really. I don'’t know
how you do it. adopting
two girls on your own.

277
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:23.759
Oh. they'’re great.

278
00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.152
Shelly'’s at the top
of her class.

279
00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.719
and Ramona.
she got early admission to Kale.

280
00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:29.547
Oh. Mako got into Kale.

281
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:31.375
Well. it'’s between
Kale and Prawn.

282
00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.203
Mako!

283
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:35.815
Oh. hello. Mum.
Didn'’t see you there.

284
00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:38.643
Nigel. Chauncey. see you
for more fun and games later.

285
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.038
- How was the game? Who won?
- Oh. Mum. you know
I don'’t keep score.

286
00:13:42.212 --> 00:13:45.346
I'’m just playing
for my personal best
and sheer narcissism these days.

287
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.652
You remember my friend Val?

288
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.698
How lovely to see you.
Oh!

289
00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:52.483
I thought Mako and Ramona
might get along.

290
00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:54.442
- Where is Ramona?
- Oh.

291
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.923
They were just here
a minute ago.

292
00:13:57.097 --> 00:13:59.969
Stop. Okay. okay.

293
00:14:00.143 --> 00:14:01.536
On the count of three.

294
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.712
One. two--

295
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:05.105
- Hey! Shelly.
- Whoo!

296
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.198
You better look out.

297
00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:14.854
<i>♪ I thought that I didn'’t care ♪</i>

298
00:14:15.637 --> 00:14:17.117
Cannonball!

Ooh. She'’s cute. Armen.

305
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:38.965
Huh? What? No. gross.
She'’s one of them.

306
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:42.055
She must have slipped.
Ramona!

307
00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:44.840
Whoops.

308
00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:50.150
Yoo-hoo. spritzer boy.
Service. please.

309
00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.326
Oh. uh. sure.
Be right there.

310
00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:58.201
On my way to you.

311
00:14:58.375 --> 00:14:59.724
Just a little shortcut.

312
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.552
I'’m closer than I appear.

313
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:08.037
Almost there.

314
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:10.126
Aw.

315
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.215
Not long now.

316
00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:15.566
That sunshine. Whoo.

317
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.003
Apologies for the delay.

318
00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:18.134
Your spritzer has arrived.

319
00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:19.657
- Finally.
- Here you go.

320
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:21.921
And you'’re welcome.

321
00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:25.533
- You'’re welcome.
- Ramona. you remember Mako?

322
00:15:25.707 --> 00:15:27.535
You guys used to
play together.

323
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:29.841
Yeah. that'’s it.
Keep it coming. Don'’t be stingy.

324
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:32.366
That'’s enough now.
Don'’t overdo it.
I don'’t wanna be saturated.

325
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.933
- You'’re welcome.
- Sorry.

326
00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:36.936
- I didn'’t mean to splash you.
- Oh. not at all.

327
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.459
Excellent form. by the way.

328
00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.809
And extra points
for giving Mother here a rinse.

329
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:44.421
Oh. this is my sister. Shelly.

330
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:47.424
Stop.

331
00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:49.209
Hey. hey. hey.
Are you talking about me?

332
00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:51.037
Was that the sign
for "handsome"?

333
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:53.343
Ugh.
There'’s more to me
than just looks.

334
00:15:53.517 --> 00:15:55.650
Hi. sorry to interrupt.
Would you care for a--

335
00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:57.782
I'’m okay. But thank you.

336
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.263
Uh. you'’re-- you'’re welcome.

337
00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:03.136
So. is this-- is this
your first summer being here?

338
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.529
At the shore? Have you--Are you going
to the club tonight?

339

00:24:21.242 --> 00:24:22.765
Your friends are jerks. Armen.

508
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:24.332
Hey. you know what?

509
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:25.507
We don'’t need
your stinking club.

510
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:26.900
We can dance right here.

511
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:29.163
Come on. Jimmy. dance.

512
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.818
- I'’m coming. Here I go.
- Make me look like an idiot.
There we go.

513
00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:33.080
In your face.

514
00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:34.516
In your face.

515
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.692
I'’m right in your face.

516
00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:38.999
-  In your face!
- Hey. where you going?

517
00:24:39.173 --> 00:24:42.393
This is exactly why
I didn'’t want
to come out tonight. Bobby.

518
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:44.004
It'’s always
gotta end in a fight.

519
00:24:44.178 --> 00:24:45.614
What are you talking about?

520
00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:47.442
We had to defend our turf. bro.

521
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:49.575
It'’s rule number one
of the brocal code.

522
00:24:49.749 --> 00:24:51.446
"Locals only. bro."

523
00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:54.493
Wait.
Is this about that girl?

524
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.799
Why were you
talking to her anyway?

525
00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:58.801
What. you like her
- or something?
- What?

526
00:24:58.975 --> 00:25:00.499
No.
I don'’t even know her.

527
00:25:00.673 --> 00:25:02.109
She'’s a sea crab. bro.

528
00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:03.153
She'’s got gills.

529
00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.459
Doesn'’t she?

530
00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:06.853
I'’m out of here.

531
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:08.419
Well. that'’s how it is. huh?

532
00:25:08.594 --> 00:25:11.771
Hey. don'’t forget who
your friends are. Armen.

533
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:12.946
Friends?

534
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.817
You used me
to get in the club.

535
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.689
Yeah. but that doesn'’t mean
I didn'’t want to hang out.

536
00:25:16.863 --> 00:25:18.212
Well. I don'’t want
to hang out with you. Bobby.

537
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.432
All right.
I never want to hang out.

538
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:22.999
Then go home. Armen.

539
00:25:23.173 --> 00:25:25.567
Nobody'’s gonna notice
you'’re gone anyway.

540
00:25:40.626 --> 00:25:42.192
Hey. You okay. Armen?

541
00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:44.368
It got a little
heated back there.

542
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.284
I know. I know.
I just-- I--

543
00:25:47.458 --> 00:25:49.591
I'’ll talk to him
in the morning. Okay?

544
00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.425
Gotta go!

545
00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:00.254
Not so tough without
your boys around. are you?

546
00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:04.127
All alone. are we?
What happened?

547
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:06.390
You couldn'’t close
with my girl?

548
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.697
Where are you going?

549
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:10.960
We just want to talk. Here.

550
00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:12.658
No. no. please no. No.

551
00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:14.398
- No. no. Stop. Stop.
- Let me help you out.

552
00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:18.141
Oh. I can see your bum.

553
00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:20.100
- There'’s the bum now.
- Give me back my shell.

554
00:26:20.274 --> 00:26:21.667
- Would you look at his head?
- Here. up to me.

555
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.234
No. please. Please stop.

556
00:26:24.408 --> 00:26:27.194
Ugh. I wouldn'’t be caught dead
wearing this thing.

557
00:26:27.368 --> 00:26:29.326
- Give it back. No.
- Whoa.

558
00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:34.549
Come on. Stop. stop.
It'’s all I have.

559
00:26:34.723 --> 00:26:36.551
Come on. Nigel.
Give the rest of us a turn.

560
00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:38.379
Ugh.
Do you ever wash this thing?

561
00:26:38.553 --> 00:26:41.251
Give me my shell.

562
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.911
Playtime'’s over. spritzer boy.

563
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:54.569
No. no. no.

564
00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:57.746
Leave him alone.

565
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.748
What do you care?
He'’s a townie.

566
00:26:59.922 --> 00:27:04.057
- Armen! Armen. help me.
- I'’m coming. Anemone.

567
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:05.188
Help. help.

568
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.670
Armen!

569
00:27:08.844 --> 00:27:10.019
I'’m coming. I'’m coming.

570
00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:14.284
Closer. a little closer.

571
00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:16.896
This is not how
I'’m going out. Armen!

572
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:21.640
Anemone!
Anemone. just hang on!

573
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:28.211
- Hey.
- Ramona. let'’s go.

574
00:27:28.385 --> 00:27:30.866
Get your claws off of me.

575
00:27:34.043 --> 00:27:35.044
Go!

576
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.526
Hey. look out!

577
00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:00.940
Here. hurry.

578
00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:02.245
I got you. sweetie.

579
00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:06.162
My shell!

580
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:40.762
Huh?

581
00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:43.939
Whoa.

582
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.550
This can'’t be our town.

583
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.121
Ma? Ma!

584
00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:56.778
- Bobby. is that you?
- Pop? Where'’s Ma?

585
00:28:56.952 --> 00:29:01.043
We'’re okay. Bobby.
You hungry?

586
00:29:01.217 --> 00:29:03.219
Yeah. Yeah. I could eat.

587
00:29:03.393 --> 00:29:06.745
All right now.
Uh. where'’s my kitchen?

588
00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:10.444
- Ah. this will do.
- Hey. yo. Bobby.
You all right?

589
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:12.794
Oof.
That was a rough one.

590
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:14.665
By the way. Mrs. Marinara.

591
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.667
I'’ll take a little bit
of whatever you'’re cooking.

592
00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:19.322
Hey. anybody seen my nephew?

593
00:29:19.496 --> 00:29:21.063
Armen. where are ya?

594
00:29:21.237 --> 00:29:24.066
-  Armen?
- Armen?

595
00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:27.026
Armen? Oh. no.

596
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.158
Armen.[crab] Armen.

597
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:30.333
Armen?

598
00:30:04.193 --> 00:30:05.281
Where am I?

599
00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:10.460
Anemone!

600
00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:15.683
Anemone?

601
00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:20.122
It'’s gone.

602
00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:28.827
Hey! Hey. hey. hey. wait up.

603
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:30.872
Have you seen my shell?

604
00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:33.962
It'’s about yea high
and it has an annoying
anemone on the back...

605
00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:36.225
Shh. Keep it down....a little slimy-- Sorry.

606
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.619
It'’s just that you develop
sort of a love-hate
relationship over the years

607
00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:41.143
which also is very symbiotic
and codependent.

608
00:30:45.452 --> 00:30:46.409
Hide.

609
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:48.237
Where? I don'’t have--

610
00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:00.075
That was a close one.

611
00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:02.469
Hey. stay safe out there.

612
00:31:02.643 --> 00:31:04.079
All right--

613
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:09.693
Oh. no.

614
00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:48.384
- Good luck to you.
- Hey.

615
00:31:54.303 --> 00:31:58.046
What? What the shell is that?
Wait. no. No.

616
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.180
Hello?
Uh. there seems to be
some kind of mistake.

617
00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:02.877
Hey.
you get what you get. pal.

618
00:32:03.051 --> 00:32:05.575
It ain'’t like any of us
got the shell of our dreams.

619
00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:06.750
Ain'’t that the truth?

620
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.101
I'’ll trade you.

621
00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:10.711
No. you don'’t understand.

622
00:32:10.885 --> 00:32:13.932
My shell is very
important to me. Okay.

623
00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:15.629
Okay. Bye.

624
00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:17.718
Has anyone here seen it?

625
00:32:17.892 --> 00:32:19.938
It'’s-- It'’s about my size.

626
00:32:20.112 --> 00:32:21.548
It'’s tight but not too tight.

627
00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:23.071
Kind of a tapered cut
at the hip.

628
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:25.508
- Ah!
- Hey. watch where you'’re going.

629
00:32:25.682 --> 00:32:28.424
Oh. sorry. sorry.
I was just looking for my shell.

630
00:32:28.598 --> 00:32:30.861
- It was stolen.
- Stolen. huh?

631
00:32:31.036 --> 00:32:33.038
Is that an accusation?

632
00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:34.561
What? No. no. no. I--Whoa. whoa.

633
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.606
Hang on a sec.
Wait a minute. wait a minute.

634
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.695
- I think I know this guy.
- You do?

635
00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:40.219
Me? This guy?

636
00:32:40.393 --> 00:32:42.438
It'’s Armen. right?
Yeah. you know. Armen.

637
00:32:42.612 --> 00:32:45.833
Is he a friend of yours
or a friend of ours?

638
00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:47.704
He'’s Bruno'’s nephew.

639
00:32:47.878 --> 00:32:49.489
Oh. yeah.

640
00:32:49.663 --> 00:32:52.100
How you doin'’?

641
00:32:52.274 --> 00:32:55.321
I'’m good. You know.
lost and afraid for my life.

642
00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:57.584
But. um. other than that.
I can'’t complain.

643
00:32:57.758 --> 00:33:01.370
Hey. tell your uncle
Big Sal and Little Junior
says hi.

644
00:33:01.544 --> 00:33:03.024
Okay.
Will do. Little Junior.

645
00:33:03.198 --> 00:33:05.592
No. I'’m Big Sal.

646
00:33:05.766 --> 00:33:07.376
He'’s Little Junior.

647
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.813
Right. That--
That makes more sense.

648
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.641
So. what is this?
Your first pinch?

649
00:33:11.815 --> 00:33:14.079
Ah. don'’t worry about it.
Everybody gets pinched.

650
00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:17.430
What matters is that
you don'’t squeal.

651
00:33:17.604 --> 00:33:18.997
- All right?
- Yeah.

652
00:33:19.171 --> 00:33:20.476
Don'’t say nothin'’. All right?

653
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.000
No. no. I wasn'’t.

654
00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:24.263
- Ow.
- You don'’t know nothin'’.

655
00:33:24.437 --> 00:33:26.526
No. I don'’t.
I'’m confused. truth be told.

656
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.831
That'’s a good kid.

657
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:29.398
Oh.

658
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:30.530
What'’s happening?

659
00:33:30.704 --> 00:33:32.880
Hermit crabs. two for one.

660
00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:34.621
Hey. kid.
You want a hermit crab?

661
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:42.803
It'’s happening again.

662
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.563
Hey. uh. are you okay?

663
00:34:03.737 --> 00:34:06.000
You'’re alive.

664
00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.523
It'’s you.

665
00:34:08.437 --> 00:34:09.482
Where are we?

666
00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:12.224
On the boardwalk. I think.

667
00:34:12.398 --> 00:34:14.356
Uh. how far
are we from the ocean?

668
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.923
In-- In crab legs?

669
00:34:16.097 --> 00:34:18.578
I don'’t know.
Maybe a million. give or take.

670
00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:21.624
I'’ve never been
out of the ocean
for this long.

671
00:34:21.798 --> 00:34:24.018
If I don'’t get to water soon.
I--

672
00:34:24.192 --> 00:34:27.674
I-- I don'’t know
how long I'’ve got.

673
00:34:27.848 --> 00:34:29.850
I don'’t belong in here.

674
00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:31.634
What. you think
we belong in here?

675
00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:33.245
No. no.
That'’s not what I meant.

676
00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:35.421
You think you'’re better than us.
huh. princess?

677
00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:37.205
No. I--Hey. guys. guys. guys.
come on.

678
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.815
Go easy on her. okay?
She'’s with me.

679
00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:41.253
What is she?
Your girlfriend or something?

680
00:34:41.427 --> 00:34:42.645
What. are you kidding me?

681
00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:44.952
Armen knows better
than to date a sea crab.

682
00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:48.434
-  Yeah.
- No. Yeah. What?
Locals only. guys. Hello.

683
00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:51.350
You don'’t understand.
I need to get home.

Home?
We'’re not going home.

685
00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:56.268
At least not
the one you came from.

686
00:34:56.442 --> 00:35:00.446
- What do you mean?
- This is a death sentence.

687
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.752
How-- How exactly?

688
00:35:02.926 --> 00:35:04.363
I want that one.

689
00:35:04.537 --> 00:35:06.060
Are you gonna feed it
this time?

690
00:35:06.234 --> 00:35:07.192
That'’s how.

691
00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:15.678
Again?

692
00:35:17.245 --> 00:35:19.595
Tell them nothing.
you hear me? Nothing!

693
00:35:20.683 --> 00:35:22.990
Thank you for coming.

694
00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:25.949
Now. I know the storm
has affected all of us.

695
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.864
Yeah. Just look at poor Curly.

696
00:35:28.038 --> 00:35:30.215

00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:31.694

Everyone. this is Val
and her daughter Shelly.

699
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:38.179
Her other daughter. Ramona.
has not been seen
since the storm.

700
00:35:38.353 --> 00:35:40.921
- Oh. Val.
- Don'’t you worry.
we'’re gonna find her.

701
00:35:41.095 --> 00:35:42.705

702
00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:46.231
my nephew. Armen.
is also missing.[all] Oh.

703
00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:48.407
- Whatever we can do to help.
- That'’s right.

704
00:35:48.581 --> 00:35:52.976

- Whoa. whoa.
Hey. what are you doing?

- Getting their attention.

779
00:39:26.015 --> 00:39:28.453

are wrong about
absolutely everything.

she may have

00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:13.503
What?

847
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:17.377
Mmm. Dang. that'’s good.

848
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:19.118
- What is in this?
- It'’s just pure sugar.

849
00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:20.554
Whoa.

850
00:43:20.728 --> 00:43:22.382
- It'’s got a bit of a kick.
- Look out!

851
00:43:24.514 --> 00:43:25.690
You'’re gonna get us killed.

852
00:43:25.864 --> 00:43:27.561
You have no idea
what you'’re doing.

853
00:43:27.735 --> 00:43:30.216
Please. if it wasn'’t for me.
you'’d still be in the cage.

854
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.087
Fair point.
That'’s a fair point.

855
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:34.394
Now can I return the favor
by getting you home
in one piece?

856
00:43:34.568 --> 00:43:36.004
Alive preferably.

857
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:37.397
- Please?
- Fine.

858
00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:40.182
Wonderful.
Now where is the ocean?

859
00:43:40.356 --> 00:43:42.271
I-- I can'’t see a thing
from down here.

860
00:43:42.445 --> 00:43:44.012
We gotta get to higher ground.

861
00:43:45.448 --> 00:43:47.537
There.
That looks like it'’s headed up.

862
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:49.365
Nice and slow too.

863
00:43:57.025 --> 00:43:59.332
Come on. come on.
We should sit in front
to get a good view.

864
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:02.161
All right. up you get.

865
00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:15.217
Seriously?
We could walk quicker.

866
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:20.135
I mean. if this is what passes
for fun in your town.
I'’ll take the ocean any day.

867
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:23.530
Yeah? Okay. well if the ocean'’s
so great. then why didn'’t you
just stay there?

868
00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:27.273
You know. you'’re just
like those meathead friends
of yours at the club.

869
00:44:27.447 --> 00:44:31.146
"Ay. yo. way.
Forget about it. House music."

870
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.888
That'’s
- a terrible impression.
- It'’s spot on.

871
00:44:34.062 --> 00:44:35.934
- I'’m nothing like those guys.
- Yeah. right.

872
00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:37.979
And besides.
I'’d rather be a meathead

873
00:44:38.153 --> 00:44:40.416
than one of those
Richie Rich pretty boys
that you find attractive.

874
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.592
"Where'’s my tea and crumpets. love?

875
00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:45.073
You know what. never mind.
I'’ll just take yours.

876
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:48.076
Oh. I can see your bum.
There'’s Armen'’s bum."

877
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.297
You know what?
As soon as we
get off this thing.

878
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:53.516
I think we should just
- go our separate ways.
- Sounds good to me.

879
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:56.041
I don'’t need anybody else
holding me back. Mom.

880
00:44:56.215 --> 00:44:58.434
And I don'’t need
a tour guide
with a death wish.

881
00:44:58.608 --> 00:45:00.262
Great. you'’ll go your way
and I'’ll go mine.

882
00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:03.091
- That'’s exactly what I want.
- Well. I said it first. so...

883
00:45:03.265 --> 00:45:05.180
I'’m saying it too.
We both said it.

884
00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:07.400
Finally.
There'’s the ocean. See?

885
00:45:07.574 --> 00:45:09.228
Now how do we get down?

886
00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:13.841

if Mako messed with that kid.
I'’m gonna tear him apart.

with melted butter.

- Take it easy?

982
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:51.162

Mako said about us.

983
00:49:52.598 --> 00:49:54.904
All right. come here.
All of youse.

984
00:49:55.862 --> 00:49:56.950
Let me tell you a story.

985
00:49:57.124 --> 00:49:59.300
I used to be tough.
all right.

986
00:49:59.474 --> 00:50:02.651
Once upon a time.
I used to get into fights too.

987
00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:05.959
And sometimes
I would lose a claw.

988
00:50:06.133 --> 00:50:10.877
And every time I lost a claw.
another one would grow back
in its place.

989
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:14.185
But then I got into
one fight too many.

990
00:50:14.359 --> 00:50:18.058
And when I lost my claw.
it didn'’t grow back.

991
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.278
Capisce.

992
00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:23.846
Now you keep going
down this road.

993
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.631
how do you think
it'’s gonna end?

994
00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.287
What-- What'’s going on
in there?

995
00:50:29.461 --> 00:50:31.550
Sea crabs.

996
00:50:31.724 --> 00:50:32.942
What are they doing in there?

997
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:34.292
That'’s our club.

998
00:50:34.466 --> 00:50:37.121
It'’s my club.
I'’ll handle it.

999
00:50:37.947 --> 00:50:38.948

1014
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.486
Well. it'’s not the ocean.
but will this tide you over
for a bit?

1015
00:51:39.052 --> 00:51:40.532
Uh. yeah.

1016
00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:48.105
No.

1017
00:51:48.279 --> 00:51:50.150
Don'’t worry. Ramona.
I got this.

1018
00:51:56.591 --> 00:51:57.766
I'’ll get the next one.
Hang in there.

1019
00:52:16.698 --> 00:52:18.526
I'’m so sorry. Ramona.

1020
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.311
Are you kidding?

1021
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:22.791
That'’s the nicest thing
anyone'’s ever done for me.

1022
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:26.578
Hey. it'’s not your fault.

1023
00:52:28.275 --> 00:52:31.017
I got myself
into this mess.

1024
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:36.240
There'’s just. like.
all this pressure to be
perfect all the time. I--

1025
00:52:36.414 --> 00:52:39.852
I guess
I just wanted to make
my own mistakes for once.

1026
00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:41.723
You know?

1027
00:52:41.897 --> 00:52:43.638
Well. I'’d--
I'’d say you did it.

1028
00:52:43.812 --> 00:52:45.466
I mean.
this has gotta be up there.

1029
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.121
As mistakes go.
you know. top five ever made.

1030
00:52:48.295 --> 00:52:50.906
So congrats.
You should be proud.

1031
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.038
Shut up. Armen.

1032
00:52:52.212 --> 00:52:54.083
Armen!

1033
00:52:57.696 --> 00:52:59.176
Where are you. buddy?

1034
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:00.351
Huh?

1035
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.052
Hey. kid.

1036
00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:08.620
Huh?

1037
00:53:10.317 --> 00:53:12.450
Kid. you all right?
Are you lost?

1038
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.235
Do you need help?

1039
00:53:19.631 --> 00:53:22.329
Whoa.
Okay. clearly you
don'’t need my help.

1040
00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:24.766
And I assume
you'’re not lost neither.

1041
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.029
I got it.
You'’re probably
looking for your sister.

1042
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:28.857
Well. I was just looking
for my friend and--

1043
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:33.035
All right. look. I get it.
You don'’t trust me.

1044
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.952
But we didn'’t have
anything to do with
anything Mako was saying. I--

1045
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:40.173
I mean. we'’re land crabs.
but we'’re not animals.

1046
00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:42.654
Can I get off the ground now?

1047
00:53:43.959 --> 00:53:45.396
Hello?

1048
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.398
Really? Nothing?
All right.

1049
00:53:49.835 --> 00:53:51.228
Maybe it'’s better
she'’s not looking.

1050
00:53:53.404 --> 00:53:55.449
Okay. I did it.
Hey. wait up!

1051
00:53:55.623 --> 00:53:57.408
You think maybe
we could join forces?

1052
00:53:57.582 --> 00:53:59.671
I could use the protection. obviously.

1053
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:08.810
Sorry. I didn'’t realize
you were. uh...

1054
00:54:08.984 --> 00:54:11.073
I mean.
I thought you could. uh...

1055
00:54:12.336 --> 00:54:13.424
Were you born this way?

1056
00:54:17.993 --> 00:54:20.909
Me? [chuckles] Yeah. yeah.
I was born this way.

1057
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:22.563
Unfortunately.

1058
00:54:25.174 --> 00:54:26.567
Oh. hey. you know what?

1059
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:28.569
I got a cousin who'’s deaf.
Do you know him?

1060
00:54:28.743 --> 00:54:31.442
Nah. I mean.
of course you don'’t know him.

1061
00:54:31.616 --> 00:54:35.228
I just mean. you know.
like. I thought maybe
you'’d stick together.

1062
00:54:35.402 --> 00:54:37.709
You know.
'’cause it'’s probably
not easy to--

1063
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:43.845
You know. I mean.
it'’s gotta be hard
to deal with-- to-- to--

1064
00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:46.935
To deal with stupid idiots
asking boneheaded questions.

1065
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:50.896
Bobby. you really
are as dumb as you look.

1066
00:54:58.251 --> 00:55:00.166
Look. I'’m sorry.
Okay? I--

1067
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.951
Everybody looks at me
and assumes that
I'’m some meathead

1068
00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:04.518
that wants to fight
all the time.

1069
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:08.043
You know. it'’s like
they expect it from me and--

1070
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:12.439
Well. I'’m just sick and tired
of not being seen for me.

1071
00:55:12.613 --> 00:55:13.614
You know what I mean?

1072
00:55:17.226 --> 00:55:18.837
Yeah. I have a feeling you do.

1073
00:55:19.011 --> 00:55:25.365
Hey. hey. hey.
Maybe we have more
in common than we think.

1074
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:29.195
That'’s not what I said. is it?

1075
00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:32.285
Well. was it close at least?

1076
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.246
Come on. kid.
Let'’s get you back.

1077
00:55:38.073 --> 00:55:39.161
Thanks.

1078
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:41.816
You know. this is cool.

1079
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:43.992
I never had
a female friend before.

1080
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.952
Armen?

1081
00:55:47.126 --> 00:55:48.736
Can I ask you something?[Armen] Sure.

1082
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:52.784
If Mako
hadn'’t interrupted us
at the club.

1083
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:56.135
would you have asked me
- to dance?
- What? No. Definitely not.

1084
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:58.137
Oh.

1085
00:55:58.311 --> 00:56:00.531
No. I just mean.
I-- I'’ve never done
anything like that before.

1086
00:56:00.705 --> 00:56:04.578
so it would have been completely
out of character for me.

1087
00:56:04.752 --> 00:56:06.537
To ask a sea crab
to dance?

1088
00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.409
Or-- Or anyone.

1089
00:56:11.237 --> 00:56:15.023
I haven'’t done a lot of things.
not for a long time.

1090
00:56:15.676 --> 00:56:16.851
Why not?

1091
00:56:19.593 --> 00:56:21.552
There was a storm
when I was a kid.

1092
00:56:21.726 --> 00:56:24.598
and my parents
didn'’t make it.

1093
00:56:24.772 --> 00:56:26.295
I haven'’t been
in the water since.

1094
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.167
Oh. Armen.

1095
00:56:28.341 --> 00:56:32.650
The truth is
I'’ve been hiding in my shell
my entire life.

1096
00:56:33.477 --> 00:56:35.392
After they were gone.

1097
00:56:35.566 --> 00:56:39.265
it was just a good excuse
to stay inside.

1098
00:56:39.439 --> 00:56:43.530
Hey. I think you'’re
a lot braver than
you give yourself credit for.

1099
00:56:43.704 --> 00:56:47.055
Yeah. well. you'’re seeing me
on a particularly good day.

1100
00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:51.408
I mean.
if I'’ve been brave at all.
it'’s only because of you.

1101
00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:54.106
I can'’t believe
I just said that.

1102
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.630
- I'’m such a weirdo.
- Yeah. you are.

1103
00:56:57.675 --> 00:56:58.850
You'’re not like anyone.

1104
00:56:59.024 --> 00:57:00.329
Oh.

1105
00:57:02.636 --> 00:57:04.159
That'’s a good thing.

1106
00:57:10.818 --> 00:57:12.298
Well. this is your stop.

1107
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.826
Don'’t worry. kid.
We'’ll find '’em.

1108
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.872
But no more sneaking out.
all right?

1109
00:57:21.046 --> 00:57:23.788
- Get your claws off of her!
- No. ma'’am.

1110
00:57:23.962 --> 00:57:25.833
We were just out here looking
for your daughter and--

1111
00:57:26.007 --> 00:57:29.010
Don'’t you come near us!

1112
00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:30.838
I know exactly who he is.

1113
00:57:31.012 --> 00:57:32.318
Ma'’am. you don'’t understand.

1114
00:57:32.492 --> 00:57:34.929
- Haven'’t you done enough?
- I'’m sorry. I--

1115
00:57:35.103 --> 00:57:37.105
I wasn'’t--You stay away from her!

1116
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:40.021
No. ma'’am. please.
I'’m not who you think I am.

1117
00:57:40.195 --> 00:57:42.067
Stay away!

1118
00:57:47.899 --> 00:57:49.466

I don'’t get paid enough
for this. I'’m out!

1143
00:59:51.805 --> 00:59:54.068
Oh. no.

1144
00:59:54.242 --> 00:59:55.635
- What have you guys done?
- Huh?

1145
00:59:57.768 --> 01:00:00.292
Hey. look who finally
came to his senses.

1146
01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:02.903
Here we go.
Now it'’s a fair fight.

1147
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:06.080
Where'’s the fun in that?

1148
01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:10.519
Boys. please. no more fighting.

1149
01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:11.608
Oh!

1150
01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:14.828
Here comes the Condition!

1151
01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.181
Whoa. Guys. guys.
it doesn'’t have to be like this.

1152
01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.574
Bobby. help!

1153
01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:25.883
Let him go!

1154
01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:28.189
Manny. no. Let go.

1155
01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:30.496
Guys. come on.
Break it up.

1156
01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:38.069
That'’s enough!

1157
01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:51.256
Hey. he had it coming. Bobby.

1158
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.736
You did
what you had to do.

1159
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.215
Way to go. man.

1160
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.174
Is a high five appropriate
in this moment?

1161
01:00:56.348 --> 01:01:00.613
Mark my words.
this isn'’t over!

1162
01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.659
Oh. yeah?
Looks pretty done to me.

1163
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.964
Your friend Armen...

1164
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.488
he'’s dead.

1165
01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:15.889
Anemone. are you okay?

1166
01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:20.589
- My nephew. is it true?
- The wave.

1167
01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:22.417
- Mako.
- What did they do to you?

1168
01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:23.854
I think he'’s shell-shocked.

1169
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:28.859
This means war.

1170
01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:30.338
Come on!

1171
01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.863
You coming. Bobby?

1172
01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.353
- Armen?
- Yeah?

1173
01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:47.399
What do you think it'’ll be like
when we get back?

1174
01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:50.663
Big step.

1175
01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.665
Thanks.

1176
01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:57.583
I mean. you know.
what do you think
they'’ll think of us?

1177
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.412
- Us?
- Yeah.

1178
01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.761
Us.

1179
01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:13.555
Hey. I think I found
a little calamari.

1180
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.515
Oh. no. no. no.
that'’s just chewing gum.

1181
01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:19.126
- Ooh! Found some cannoli.
- Yeah? Let me see.

1182
01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:21.433
Oh! What is this?

1183
01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.874
No. No. Ramona. I--

1184
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:31.486
What are you doing. kid?

1185
01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.140
Oh. whoa.

1186
01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:35.099
Ramona--

1187
01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.405
Hey. kid. Come here.
Let me give you
a piece of advice. right?

1188
01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:41.018
A young guy like you.
you don'’t want to get
tied down yet.

1189
01:02:41.192 --> 01:02:42.628
Just forget about her.

1190
01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:46.545
Ramona. wait.

1191
01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.068
Here.
Want some cannoli?

1192
01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.419
Who turns down cannoli?

1193
01:02:57.034 --> 01:02:58.078
Ramona!

1194
01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.213
Ramona. I'’m sorry.
I messed up back there.

1195
01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:05.346
I just--
Please. just give me
another chance?

1196
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.871
What. are you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

1197
01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.916
Well--Are you gonna meet my family?

1198
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:12.527
I mean. what do you think
my mother'’s gonna say?

1199
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.530
- Ramona.
- Forget it. Armen.

1200
01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:17.750
This was never gonna work out.

1201
01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.289
It'’s okay. I got you.

1202
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:50.783
This is our beach.
It'’s time to take it back.

1203
01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:53.742
Tourist season is officially

1204
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.309
over!

1205
01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:58.704
What are we doing here?

1206
01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:01.272
How many claws
must be lost?

1207
01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:03.361
Your nephew is dead
because of them.

1208
01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:06.886
So. if you won'’t fight for this.
what will you fight for?

1209
01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:15.068
Who do they think they are?

1210
01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.636
If we let them take
our summer vacation.
what'’s next?

1211
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.770
Spring break?
Winter holiday? Boxing Day?

1212
01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.643
Are we gonna let them
run us out of here?

1213
01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:28.255
Or are we gonna fight?

1214
01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.604
Are you with me?

1215
01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:34.740
Um. I mean-- For Ramona!

1216
01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.829
For Ramona!

1217
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.182
Hold on. Ramona.

1218
01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.792
The ocean'’s right there.

1219
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.446
It'’s just on the other side
of this dune.

1220
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.013
See? It'’s right over there.

1221
01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:59.286
- No.
- It'’s too far. I can'’t. I--

1222
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:03.900
Ramona.
No. no. no. Please.
Please wake up.

1223
01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:06.250
Come on.

1224
01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:09.209
I can'’t do this without you.

1225
01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.342
I'’m not strong enough.

1226
01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:59.346
For Ramona!

1227
01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.088
For Armen!

1228
01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:03.394
Armen!

1229
01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.750
I'’m gonna go get a snack.
Bye. Dad.

1230
01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:13.143
Have fun.

1231
01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.058
Whoa.
Really packed in here.

1232
01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:16.668
Huh?

1233
01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:34.642
Gotcha!

1234
01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:40.866
Crank it. Crank it. Oh!

1235
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.088
Here comes the Condition!
Boom! Boom!

1236
01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:49.048

1237
01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:52.878
One order of
Ma'’s special meatballs.
coming up.

1238
01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.838
Love you. Ma!

1239
01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:59.711
Love you too. baby!

1240
01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.495
Where do you think
you'’re going. huh?

1241
01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:03.541
Light '’em up. ladies!

1242
01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:06.979
Fire!

1243
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:11.940
Ooh.

1244
01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:24.779
- Bruno!
- You came.

1245
01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:27.304
Ah. someone'’s gotta
look out for you knuckleheads.

1246
01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:28.479
Look out.

1247
01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:32.309
For Armen!

1248
01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:33.614
What the--

1249
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:51.371
Wait. What is going on here?

1250
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.748
Ramona!

1251
01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:46.094
You'’re okay.[Val] Ramona!

1252
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:47.705
Mom.

1253
01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:48.923
Shelly.

1254
01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.796
Oh. my baby.

1255
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.539
Mom. I'’m so sorry.

1256
01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:57.976
Oh. honey. I'’m sorry.

1257
01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:59.934
- Hey. Armen.
- Yo. Armen.

1258
01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.806
That was legendary.

1259
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.852
- Way to go. buddy.
- Bro. you were awesome out there.

1260
01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:07.203
I am so proud of you. kid.

1261
01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:12.773
Yeah. so. uh.
you gonna introduce us
to your friend over there?

1262
01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:17.343
This is Ramona.

1263
01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:21.565
My girlfriend.

1264
01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.220
Wait. Your girlfriend?

1265
01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:26.570
You got a girlfriend.

1266
01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:28.224
Armen'’s got a girlfriend!

1267
01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:31.357
- Holy Bon Jovi.
- Way to go. Armen.

1268
01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.925
Thank you for saving
my daughter.

1269
01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:35.796
You are very brave.

1270
01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.842
See? Told you so.

1271
01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:39.887
Yeah. well.
she did the same for me.

1272
01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:42.063
How did we get here?

1273
01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:52.160
You wanna know
how we got here?
Mako lied.

1274
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.075
That'’s how we got here.

1275
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:58.036
Well. that'’s not true.
Tell them. Mako.

1276
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.386
Well. I just thought--
I mean--

1277
01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.260
Well. I saw her first!

1278
01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:07.088
I bribed your way
into the finest prep schools.

1279
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.177
and this is how you repay me?

1280
01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:12.268
Oh. you'’re just
- like your father.
- No. Mommy. please don'’t go.

1281
01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:14.966
And if you do.
will you continue
to support me financially?

1282
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.054
Mother!

1283
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.363
So. you wanna come
for dinner?

1284
01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:21.842
I'’m making a sauce.

1285
01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:25.150
I'’d like that very much.

1286
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.600
Nature.
It'’s so beautiful.

1287
01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:45.605
On three.

1288
01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:48.695
One! Two! Pull!

1289
01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:55.136
Shore Point!

1290
01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.922
Back in business. baby!

1291
01:11:58.096 --> 01:12:01.099
Hey. Marinara.

1292
01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:08.498
You got something
to say. Mako?

1293
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.370
I'’ve got something for you.

1294
01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:15.809
It'’s a start.

1295
01:12:16.723 --> 01:12:18.029
Your mother
put you up to this?

1296
01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:19.596
Yes.

1297
01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:22.903
She'’s got good taste.

1298
01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.078
You treasure her.

1299
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.213
Vacancy chain!

1300
01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:30.171
- Vacancy chain?
- Vacancy chain.

1301
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.043
- Vacancy chain!

1302
01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:34.219
Whoo-hoo!

1303
01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:44.925
Aw. yeah. This is butter.

1304
01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.187
Definitely butter.

1305
01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:48.581
Beautiful.

1306
01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:51.323
All right. let me take
this puppy for a spin.

1307
01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:54.195
Hello. Denise. Looking well?

1308
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.809
Oh. Jimmy. I think
I'’m coming down with
the Condition.

1309
01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.027
Mmm.

1310
01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:02.900
She called me the Condition.

1311
01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:04.989
I told you it was gonna stick.
baby!

1312
01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:07.252
Way to go. Jimmy.

1313
01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:09.123
Hey. hold up.
Hold up. Armen.

1314
01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.561
What'’s going on?
I don'’t know.

1315
01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:13.345
Look what we found.

1316
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.825
Hey. roomie!

1317
01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:16.957
Anemone. You'’re okay.

1318
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:20.134
It is good to see you
out of the house. Armen.

1319
01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:21.919
It'’s good to be out.

1320
01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:23.790
Any shells left?

1321
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.662
Anybody?

1322
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:29.535
It'’s time. Armen.

1323
01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:31.755
You sure about this?

1324
01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:34.322
Oh. 100%.

1325
01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:36.499
Anyone here got a shell?

1326
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:38.022
Hey. Curly.

1327
01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:44.245
Check me out.

1328
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.204
Come. Curly.
Let'’s paint this town.

1329
01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.292
Whoo-hoo!
