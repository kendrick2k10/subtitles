3
00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.967
Riki.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.900
Riki! Riki! Riki!

5
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.100
Riki!

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.100
What does this
look like to you?

7
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.933
Just a regular old house. right?

8
00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.100
An ordinary house
on a happy occasion.

9
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.833
A house much like yours.

10
00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:43.467
But what if I was to tell you
there was someone else

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
living in your house
without your knowledge?

12
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.533
And I don't mean the hamster
that got loose last summer.

13
00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:51.133
no. no. no.

14
00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.067
It's actually someone
you've never seen before.

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.067
Perhaps you've heard of them
being referred to

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.900
by names such as Lars.
Goblins or House Elves.

17
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.167
In any case. they are
the invisible spirit of a house

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.933
and in our story.
they're called Finns.

19
00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.233
There's no creature
quite like a Finn.

20
00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.400
I know it's hard to imagine.
but these hidden roommates

21
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.633
live in every house
in the entire world.

22
00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.400
No. no. really! Even in yours.

23
00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.567
Uh. honey dear.
have you seen my glasses?

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.233
-Your glasses?
-Oh! On my head.

25
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.700
Finns keep things in order.

26
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.500
And ultimately. it's Finns
who turn your house

27
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.233
into a home...sweet...home.

28
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.033
Finns have a duty
to watch over everyone

29
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.067
and everything
within their home.

30
00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.167
Ah!

31
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.433
Of course. Finns take special
care of their family's pets...

32
00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:02.467
Wuh?

33
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.833
..whether they be tiny or plump.

34
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:07.267
tabby or ginger.

35
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.467
Whoa!

36
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.500
This is gonna go viral
in no time!

37
00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:14.633
They even keep an eye on you
when you stay up way too late

38
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.167
and snooze through your alarm.

39
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800
-Huh?

40
00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:20.900
Ugh! Oh. no. again?!

41
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.500
You get the picture.

42
00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.333
The chief goal of a Finn

43
00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.167
is to bring peace and harmony
into the home.

44
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.867
It's their way of life
and their guiding purpose.

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.933
No Finn would ever dream
about breaking

46
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.433
this glorious tradition.

47
00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:40.667
And that. my friends.
is the end of our story.

48
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.000
Or it would have been.

49
00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:46.600
had it not been for
one singularly unusual Finn.

50
00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.333
Oh. I refuse to stay in
this house for one more minute!

51
00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.300
Well. it was your idea
to rent it. remember?

52
00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:01.167
Oh. yeah?! Well. why
didn't YOU talk me out of it?!

53
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.667
I. uh. didn't know.

54
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.400
Maybe if you'd done
the walk-through

55
00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:08.833
like I asked you to. you would
have noticed the evil energy!

56
00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.400
But you didn't
because you never listen!

57
00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:12.800
What now? Oh. never mind.

58
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.400
It's fine. we'll just go
and live with your mother.

59
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.367
What?
Has it come to that?

60
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.733
-It can't be any worse!
-Oh. such a pity!

61
00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.833
But they had to go!

62
00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.467
-Ah!

63
00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.100
Oh! Whose house? My house!

64
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:37.700
Whoo-hoo!
Shake it. shake it. shake it!

65
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.733
Let's see what we've got here!

66
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.967
Strike! Hm!

67
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.133
No humans. No problems!

68
00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:27.900
This is my house!

69
00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:49.667
We're almost there. guys!

70
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.433
I just keep forgetting
the name of this town.

71
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.600
-Berg. sweetie. Berg.
-Mm!

72
00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:58.200
I hope Christine's able to make
some new friends in this town.

73
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:01.333
Every time I make new
friends we have to move again.

74
00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.233
so I'm not sure
that I see the point.

75
00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:07.833
Anyway. detectives
don't really need friends.

76
00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:09.900
We have to focus
on our investigations.

77
00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:13.100
Do you really think
there'll be anything

78
00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.900
to investigate
in this adorable little town?

79
00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.800
Mom. there's
an adorable little town

80
00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.467
just like this one in my book.

81
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.633
"The mastermind's trail

82
00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:26.100
"led straight to
a quiet mountain town.

83
00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:28.067
"and there was no way of knowing

84
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.133
"that all of its citizens.
from the police to the baker.

85
00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.667
"belonged to a criminal gang.

86
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.833
"The very last thing
Amanda expected to find was..."

87
00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:41.267
-Our own amusement park!
-Oh. look. Christine!

88
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.333
They even have a Ferris wheel!

89
00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:44.533
Anyone up for a ride?

90
00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:45.800
-I am!
-Yeah!

91
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.733
-Ha-ha!
-Dad. you just missed the turn.

92
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:49.700
Ha!
Thanks for watching. Sherlock.

93
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.333
Nothing gets past this one.

94
00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:55.033
All done? That went by fast.

95
00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.367
What's the point?

96
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.800
I already figured out
who did it.

97
00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:06.300
Oops. boom gate!
That was a close one!

98
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.967
MAN OVER MEGAPHONE:
The detective enters the shot

99
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and cautiously looks for clues.

100
00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.633
Did I not say cautiously?!

101
00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:18.133
Aha!
He sees something suspicious!

102
00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:21.767
Might this be the evidence
he's looking for?

103
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.233
That's it. keep going!

104
00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:25.167
JB. that trash
won't empty itself.

105
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.700
Yeah. can I do it later?

106
00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:30.200
I need to get into character
and warm up for my big scene.

107
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:31.700
-Tick-tock!
-Huh!

108
00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:34.367
Let's set up for the next scene!
Extras. stand by!

109
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.600
What a strange set
of circumstances indeed.

110
00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:41.967
But even this crime
has to have a villain.

111
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.233
a Violet Villain. that is.

112
00:06:44.267 --> 00:06:47.633
Ah! Oh! Bah-bah-bah-bah!

113
00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:50.733
Wha... Wha... What?

114
00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:52.833
What in the world? Cut!

115
00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:55.067
What are you doing?!

116
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.667
You're just supposed to walk by.
that's all!

117
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.200
Hear me out.

118
00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:02.267
I've got an idea that would
make the scene so much better!

119
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.800
I've got one as well.
Get off of my set!

120
00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:07.800
Want another take?

121
00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.833
Uh...

122
00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:12.400
Nah. that'll do.
Moving on. people!

123
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:14.167
What's taking so long?!

124
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.700
A tortoise moves faster
than you. Shoulda hired him!

125
00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:19.100
You must be the newbies!

126
00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:20.900
-Uh-huh. uh-huh!
-Uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah!

127
00:07:20.933 --> 00:07:22.867
And we're so grateful
to be here!

128
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.267
And of course.
we're both classically trained.

129
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.767
Good for you.

130
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.200
Welcome to
our micro-budget nightmare...

131
00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.900
..I mean.
our hit detective series.

132
00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.800
'The Violet Villain'.

133
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:32.800
Here's your pages.

134
00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.633
Oh! Will the rest be coming?

135
00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.000
Our director never
gives out the whole script

136
00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.367
so we can keep up the intrigue.
even amongst the actors.

137
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.700
So much for intrigue.

138
00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:42.967
The butler did it.

139
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.533
What makes you think that?

140
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:47.167
Could be that man in the
butler costume with the knife.

141
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.867
-Elementary.
-Alright!

142
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.800
Well. here are the keys to your
new house for the time being.

143
00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:52.833
Oh. thank you.

144
00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:55.267
Uh. it's not
what I'd call a "Wow!"

145
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.600
Let's face it.
you guys aren't a "Wow!"

146
00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:01.167
Hey! Stop!
Where you taking that?!

147
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.667
I need it for the next scene...

148
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.600
We actually
have lines in the scene!

149
00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:06.533
I'm so proud!

150
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:08.400
OK.
let's give this new scene a try.

151
00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:10.433
Quiet on the set. and action!

152
00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.133
Cut!

153
00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:17.433
Is that your idea
of an evil laugh?

154
00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:19.433
Come on!

155
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:21.600
Take 10!

156
00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:24.167
Hmm.

157
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.933
I know how you must feel.

158
00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:28.000
It must be torture for
someone with the talent

159
00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:29.500
and unparalleled genius

160
00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:31.133
you have to be surrounded

161
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:33.367
by these second-rate hacks
with no instincts.

162
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.567
Take this actor.
who should be the star...

163
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.200
-He's so wooden!
-Huh?

164
00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:39.433
I mean. where's the passion?

165
00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:41.500
How dare you say that?!

166
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.233
I'm oozing with passion!

167
00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:46.200
Just give me a shot!
I'll show you how it's done!

168
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:49.933
To perform for
a director of your stature.

169
00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:53.400
you have to put
your whole body into your art!

170
00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:55.633
If you give me
the role of this villain.

171
00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:58.867
I will gladly give you my heart!

172
00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:02.933
-Huh?

173
00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.533
Uh. what...what do you mean?

174
00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:11.033
Yep. Just when I thought
I'd seen it all.

175
00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:13.900
I guess I didn't count on you!

176
00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:17.767
Someone get this fool
off my set once and for all!

177
00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:20.867
Whoa!

178
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.200
-Oh! Whoa!

179
00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:43.500
-What?

180
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.533
You're not an actor!
You're not a villain!

181
00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:53.633
You're a janitor!

182
00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:57.167
And as of today.
you're not even that anymore

183
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.700
because you...are...fired!

184
00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.733
No! But I love this
more than anything...

185
00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.067
-I said you're fired!

186
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.733
That's showbiz. isn't it?

187
00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:08.300
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh. sure is.

188
00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:11.733
And somebody turn off
that blasted water!

189
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.133
Sweetie. are you sure
that this is the right house?

190
00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:22.133
What? Again?

191
00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:23.500
Yep.

192
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.200
Pretty sure the key
would have fit

193
00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:26.967
if the lock hadn't been broken.

194
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.100
-Well...
-Whoa. whoa. whoa!

195
00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:29.700
..I like it better than
the last one!

196
00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:33.900
This is my house! Where are you
putting all that junk. huh?

197
00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.700
Eugh! Looks like a crime scene
in here.

198
00:10:36.733 --> 00:10:39.500
Don't worry. honey.
We'll make it a home.

199
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.500
-Ugh. Awesome.
-You call this awesome?

200
00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:48.400
What would be awesome
is if you got outta here!

201
00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:51.100
Here's the perfect spot
for my record collection.

202
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.933
This is also the perfect spot
for my prank collection!

203
00:10:57.967 --> 00:11:00.100
It'll be nice and cosy
before you know it!

204
00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:02.933
Before YOU know it. you're
gonna be out on your rumps!

205
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.567
You have no idea
what you stepped in!

206
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.933
I just stepped
in something sticky.

207
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.367
A couple of comforts.
some soft music

208
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.433
and our perfect little toaster

209
00:11:13.467 --> 00:11:16.300
are all this family needs
to feel at home.

210
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.133
I'm with you. babe!

211
00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:20.600
Yoink!

212
00:11:22.733 --> 00:11:24.900
Sweetie.
have you seen the toaster?

213
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.733
And there you have it -

214
00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:34.433
half a dozen
delectable doughnuts.

215
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.967
I wish you could have seen it.

216
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.567
We were just standing there
and then we all went like this.

217
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.800
-$3.50. please.
-Everybody started laughing.

218
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:43.967
It was the last thing
they expected.

219
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.600
I didn't even mind
getting in trouble.

220
00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:47.800
Thank you. kindly.
Please come again.

221
00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.633
Hello!

222
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.000
I. uh. haven't seen you
around here. My name is...

223
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.000
Mark.

224
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.233
It's stitched right there
on your backpack.

225
00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:06.900
Of course it is.

226
00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:10.400
-Oh!
-Is this her?

227
00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:14.300
Didn't you just move into
the creepiest house in town?

228
00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:17.433
You should know that nobody
stays for long in that house.

229
00:12:17.467 --> 00:12:19.700
We never stay anywhere for long.

230
00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:21.267
But you should be careful.

231
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.500
There have been
some spine-chilling tales

232
00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:24.800
of that place.

233
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.100
Come on. everything
has a logical explanation.

234
00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:29.000
Aw!

235
00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:31.933
And I've heard that there
are sounds of bones crunching

236
00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:35.467
in the night.
or even worse...CHIPS!

237
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.367
Not to mention flying toasters!

238
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.033
That house is haunted!

239
00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:42.000
And that means that you're
gonna need a brave...

240
00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:44.400
..no. incredibly brave friend.

241
00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:48.033
Uh. thank you.
but I've got this.

242
00:12:50.233 --> 00:12:53.667
I'll haunt this town
until my last breath!

243
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.567
And you'll never. ever catch me!
No. never!

244
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.633
-We're safe.

245
00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:02.667
Huh?

246
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.833
Sorry. Mark.
but you never had a chance!

247
00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:09.133
I've had it.

248
00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:11.833
I've been trying to tell you
what's going on.

249
00:13:11.867 --> 00:13:13.833
but you never. ever listen!

250
00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:17.300
Maybe I'd listen if you stopped
yelling at me like a banshee!

251
00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:21.800
When did you become
so heartless?

252
00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.733
I'd rather live with a snake
than live with you!

253
00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:26.567
At least it would be
a little bit warmer!

254
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.200
These guys
are out of their minds!

255
00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:29.667
Oh. it's almost too easy!

256
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.267
Then why don't you
go live with your snake?

257
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.100
Stop hissing at me! Brrr.

258
00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:38.267
Wait a minute. wait a minute.
I think you missed a cue here.

259
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.933
-Huh?
-Oh. did I?

260
00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:43.133
Yeah. you forgot to say.
"Then move on and move out!"

261
00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.267
Oh. that's right.

262
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.067
You've gotta be kidding.

263
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.167
They're just saying lines
from a scene!

264
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.600
And try it
with more intensity.

265
00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:52.633
This is unacceptable!

266
00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:54.600
Yeah. great note.
Let's do it again!

267
00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.800
Shouldn't you guys
have left by now?

268
00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:58.833
-What time is it?
-Time to go.

269
00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:01.000
-I can't believe it.
-We lost track of time!

270
00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:03.367
-It all felt so real!

271
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.367
-So sinister!
-Mwah!

272
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.133
Do you know how much I love you?

273
00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.800
-I guarantee I love you more!
-Mwah!

274
00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:11.200
-Our first rehearsal!
-Hurry!

275
00:14:17.967 --> 00:14:22.833
I'm gonna do more than just
rehearse. It's opening night!

276
00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.633
Where do you think you're going?

277
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.033
Wha... What's going on?

278
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.200
Hm.

279
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.700
You thought you'd get away
with it.

280
00:15:05.733 --> 00:15:10.300
but the fickle finger of fate
just dialled your phone number.

281
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.433
You'll never catch the Violet
Villain in a blackout!

282
00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:21.800
Take it easy. Christine.

283
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.467
Everything has
a logical explanation.

284
00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:30.233
Haunted houses don't exist.

285
00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:31.900
Brrr!

286
00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:33.533
Take this!

287
00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:35.033
Ugh!

288
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.133
What the...

289
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.600
Hey. wait!

290
00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:49.467
Aren't you going to introduce
yourself? Oh. no. you don't!

291
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.767
Will you just stop
for a second so that I can...

292
00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:57.300
Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. oh! Oh!

293
00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:59.033
What did she think
she was doing?

294
00:15:59.067 --> 00:16:01.033
Did she just really bite me?!
Ow!

295
00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:03.767
Oh. boy. What are you?

296
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.667
Huh? What?!
You can actually see me?

297
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.700
-Well. I guess that I can.
-Oh. not good!

298
00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.500
Oh!

299
00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.267
It's because you yanked out
some of my fur and you...

300
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.167
Oh! A whole tuft of fur!

301
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.267
Huh?

302
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.233
And I need it!
You give me back my fur!

303
00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:26.267
Now. wait a second.

304
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.700
First I want to know
what you are.

305
00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:32.433
Oh! I'm a Finn. This is
my house and that is my fur!

306
00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:34.333
-Give it!
-Finns don't really exist.

307
00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:35.733
Oh. that's right!

308
00:16:35.767 --> 00:16:37.933
Just hang onto that thought
and give me back my fur!

309
00:16:37.967 --> 00:16:41.133
I think you're trying to say
that the reason I can see you

310
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.533
is because I have
a little piece of your fur.

311
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:46.867
In what world
is that chunk a little piece?

312
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.467
-Come on. give it back or...
-Or you'll do what?

313
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.300
Or else I'll start screaming
and banging on the walls.

314
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.300
I will go to crazy-town!

315
00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:55.933
This is all crazy-town.

316
00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:59.333
-But also interesting.
-You don't understand!

317
00:16:59.367 --> 00:17:02.600
If the other Finns were to
find out that you can see me.

318
00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:06.567
then I'll...I mean. we'll
be in serious trouble!

319
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.933
So then there are more of you?

320
00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:10.867
Uh... Nope.

321
00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:14.100
ANOTHER FINN:
Finnick. are you in there?

322
00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:15.967
Expecting someone?

323
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.533
Don't move!

324
00:17:25.067 --> 00:17:27.767
You see. I told you
he was still at home. guys!

325
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.433
-Huh?
-Huh?

326
00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:36.500
Hm. Is that one of the new ones?

327
00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:42.400
Weirdo! Why'd she freeze
in the middle of the room?

328
00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:48.233
'Cause she's a few hairs
short of a tuft! Uh. yeah.

329
00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.133
Your house always gets
the weirdos. Or the lazy ones.

330
00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:54.167
Uh. or the lazy weirdos!

331
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.300
-Yeah.
-Oh!

332
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:57.533
What?

333
00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:00.700
Oh. nothing. just a doughnut.

334
00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.500
What. are you nuts?

335
00:18:04.533 --> 00:18:07.467
What? It's practically clean!

336
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.933
What's a hungry Finn supposed...

337
00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:10.733
Now. what's that she's holding?

338
00:18:10.767 --> 00:18:12.233
Oh. that? That's nothing!

339
00:18:12.267 --> 00:18:14.333
You know those kids
and their crafting.

340
00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.033
Let's go.
We'll be late for the meeting.

341
00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:17.300
PINK AND BLUE FINN:
That's right.

342
00:18:17.333 --> 00:18:20.233
Oh. look what time it is.

343
00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:23.533
Time for me to go and
do something totally weird!

344
00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:26.200
Don't even think
about following us!

345
00:18:26.233 --> 00:18:30.200
I'm sorry. but I'm afraid
that I can't see or hear you.

346
00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:33.467
-Ohh!
-Finnick!

347
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.233
Tick-tock already or we'll be
late to our weekly Finn-counter!

348
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.067
You got that right!

349
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.233
Well. I've never left
a single trace!

350
00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:01.933
That's 'cause hygiene
is my middle name.

351
00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:06.033
And I never take anything
when they're looking!

352
00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:08.767
They can't even stomach a UFO.
let alone a Finn like you!

353
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.233
You have to put safety first.
Finnies!

354
00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:17.167
Hmm.

355
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.800
I must say I...find myself

356
00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:22.667
surprisingly interested
in this case.

357
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.533
Order! Come on. Finns.
quiet down now.

358
00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:30.500
I guess I officially declare
our weekly meeting in session.

359
00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:33.100
Hey. I hear Finnick's
got some new tenants!

360
00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:36.333
Finnick. tell us how it's going
with your new guests.

361
00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:39.533
I hope they're not
as rotten as the last ones!

362
00:19:39.567 --> 00:19:43.600
Uh...definitely not!

363
00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:46.033
They're perfectly normal!

364
00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:51.600
-Not like your usual guests!

365
00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:54.033
Enough with all
the mocking and bickering.

366
00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:56.467
We Finns gotta stick together!

367
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.167
Like this gum sticks to
my fuzzy rump!

368
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.567
Finnick. is there something
you're not saying?

369
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600
Uh. I heard Muffinn's human

370
00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:08.133
nearly burned down
a film studio!

371
00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:09.200
Good one. Finnick!

372
00:20:10.567 --> 00:20:13.167
And he almost starred
in a TV show.

373
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.267
His career's really on fire!

374
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.667
You know your man's
not an actor.

375
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.333
He's a janitor!

376
00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:25.533
No. he's an actor!
You don't know my human at all!

377
00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:27.033
He's got a real gift!

378
00:20:27.067 --> 00:20:30.200
Yeah. a gift for
being a total sad-sack loser!

379
00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:33.267
-Or a pro fire-starter!
-Yeah. Muffinn!

380
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.300
Maybe you should order him
a fire extinguisher!

381
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:40.200
And get a move on before
he burns the whole city down!

382
00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:42.233
You don't understand anything!

383
00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:46.167
You know nothing of art!
But...you'll...see.

384
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.733
Let's hurry this up.

385
00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:50.067
I got 10 doughnuts
on a soccer game!

386
00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.500
Mm-hm!

387
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.700
Yep. just one last thing.

388
00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:57.900
Isn't it time for Sherlock
to be off to sleep?

389
00:20:57.933 --> 00:21:01.367
Just one minute more.
I'm conducting an investigation.

390
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.067
Ah. and what will you call it?
The up-all-night case?

391
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.033
Funny. Mom.

392
00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:11.100
But I've got a suspect already.
so it won't be long. Hm!

393
00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:12.933
Hm. you're so clever!

394
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.133
Hm. Hmm.

395
00:21:26.333 --> 00:21:28.467
Yeah. Mom.
and if you stop by the store.

396
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.700
could you maybe pick up some...

397
00:21:30.733 --> 00:21:32.933
Let's see.

398
00:21:32.967 --> 00:21:36.000
Well. anything but cheese
with black mould.

399
00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:37.467
We already have that.

400
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.467
Yeah. yeah. I'll be here.
'K. 'bye.

401
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.767
-Huh?

402
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.967
Hey there.

403
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.267
Uh. hey there?

404
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.200
-Mark.
-Yeah. I remember.

405
00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:54.700
And your name's...

406
00:21:56.233 --> 00:21:57.767
Your name's Christine!

407
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.700
Thanks. I nearly forgot.

408
00:21:59.733 --> 00:22:02.933
So I read that book of yours.
and now I too am using

409
00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:05.267
the de...the de-de...

410
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.933
The de... The defective method!

411
00:22:07.967 --> 00:22:10.567
-Deductive method.
-That's what I meant.

412
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.267
Uh. this house
is actually pretty nice.

413
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.200
I mean. creepy.
but in a good way.

414
00:22:16.233 --> 00:22:18.500
You're the only
creepy thing here!

415
00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:21.533
Oh. how much more
do you expect me to take?

416
00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:24.867
-I just thought I'd stop by.

417
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.167
Did I see something?

418
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.367
It was probably just a rat.

419
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.000
A nasty big old furry green rat.

420
00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:34.433
Yeah. well. I-I-I was thinking

421
00:22:34.467 --> 00:22:37.933
maybe we could go see a movie.
or. you know. just hang out?

422
00:22:37.967 --> 00:22:39.267
-How about a thriller?!

423
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.133
Uh...
Wait. did you say a rat?

424
00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:43.467
Uh-huh.

425
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.900
And actually.
you're better off hanging out

426
00:22:45.933 --> 00:22:47.900
with someone who'll still
be here in a couple weeks.

427
00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:51.100
Here! You thirsty. kid?

428
00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:53.567
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

429
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.767
But I'm afraid
I should be going now.

430
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.133
So long. defective!

431
00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.800
It's only a little juice!

432
00:22:59.833 --> 00:23:02.000
Totally fine. See you later!

433
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.467
Whew!

434
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.900
Yeah. that wasn't
too awkward at all.

435
00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:12.267
I mean. at least that time we
spoke more than a few seconds.

436
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.100
You and me
gotta lay down some rules.

437
00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:18.533
You are forbidden
to bring any people here!

438
00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:20.700
Hm! And what's so bad
about people?

439
00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:24.400
Bad? Bad?! You break
everything I care about.

440
00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:27.900
You're messy and noisy
and you won't leave my house!

441
00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:31.333
Oh. and then you have the nerve
to say my house is super creepy!

442
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.633
I was one of
the all-time greats

443
00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:37.767
until my house
was rented to strangers!

444
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.833
You people have turned this
house into a three-ring circus!

445
00:23:40.867 --> 00:23:44.000
All of these babies. punks.

446
00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:46.500
little old ladies and harpists!

447
00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:49.067
-They're destroying my home!

448
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.667
How can you not see
that if the house goes away.

449
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.733
then the Finn goes away too!

450
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:56.033
But humans don't care. do you?!

451
00:23:57.533 --> 00:23:59.533
Now get out of my house!

452
00:24:06.833 --> 00:24:08.767
-Oh!

453
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.267
Ohhh!

454
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.633
So. over the years.

455
00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:20.667
I have come up with
one true motto.

456
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.633
No humans. no problems!

457
00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:25.967
Arggh!

458
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.333
Why do all humans have to be
so useless and loud

459
00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:29.667
all the time?

460
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.700
Huh? Look! Just look at this!

461
00:24:31.733 --> 00:24:34.500
This ridiculous contraption!

462
00:24:34.533 --> 00:24:36.400
Every week it's the same thing!

463
00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:38.267
Ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh!
Ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh!

464
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.700
Please tell me why even
bother planting grass

465
00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:44.067
if you won't let it grow?!

466
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.467
-Oh! Whoa!

467
00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:56.533
Run for your life!
It's Finn versus machine!

468
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.800
Don't let it cut my fur!

469
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:05.967
-Let go!
-Whoa!

470
00:25:20.967 --> 00:25:22.867
Hey!

471
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.567
Do you know
what would have happened

472
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.933
if that thing cut my fur?!

473
00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.933
Well. I suppose
you might look like

474
00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:30.700
an over-plucked. green chicken.

475
00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:32.933
And I'd be just as dumb!

476
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:34.767
But your fur is fine.

477
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.967
Oh! Have you looked back here?

478
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.200
Ew. I don't want to
look back there!

479
00:25:40.733 --> 00:25:43.433
You alright there?
You're awfully quiet.

480
00:25:43.467 --> 00:25:46.167
I think you're even angrier
than usual.

481
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:53.533
Careful!

482
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:56.200
Why would anyone
drive a car like that?

483
00:25:56.233 --> 00:26:00.167
They never stop rocking
from side to side.

484
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.567
I don't like being
tossed around like that!

485
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600
It's not my fault.

486
00:26:03.633 --> 00:26:04.733
If it wasn't for you.

487
00:26:04.767 --> 00:26:06.367
I wouldn't be here
in the first place!

488
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.700
Listen. you ought to learn
how to control your temper.

489
00:26:09.733 --> 00:26:13.267
I'm not the least bit angry.
I'm calm. Absolutely calm!

490
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.133
Absolutely!

491
00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:16.833
Oh. yeah.

492
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.700
Mm. 'bout time the coal arrived.

493
00:26:25.967 --> 00:26:27.933
Do you see what
you've reduced me to?

494
00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:29.533
Hey!

495
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.167
-Ow!
-Oh! What do I do with you?

496
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.467
-Because seven ate nine. Hey!

497
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.833
This way!

498
00:26:38.867 --> 00:26:40.767
Took 'em long enough
to get us this coal!

499
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.133
Wha... This isn't coal!

500
00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.333
What...

501
00:26:58.367 --> 00:26:59.467
What's the idea?!

502
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.167
Huh! There's no driver!

503
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.167
Looks like...popcorn?

504
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.300
I never thought I'd say this.
but run for your lives!

505
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.333
It's popcorn!

506
00:27:17.167 --> 00:27:19.433
-Go take your lunch break. Dad.

507
00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:24.400
I gotta call you back.

508
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.867
Ugh!

509
00:27:42.967 --> 00:27:44.967
Stop! In the name of justice!

510
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.933
Running will only make things
worse.

511
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.500
Huh?

512
00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:53.967
Run! It's a snack attack!

513
00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:13.700
Popcorn! Tasty popcorn!

514
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:18.600
Popcorn! Get your popcorn here!
Tasty popcorn!

515
00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:21.133
Huh? Mm!

516
00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:25.567
Popcorn! Tasty popcorn!

517
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.033
Tasty popcorn!

518
00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:32.233
Taxi! Huh?

519
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.700
Don't expect a positive review
after this!

520
00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.100
Whoa!

521
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.400
Please help me.

522
00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:57.267
Oh-ho!

523
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.567
Juan Sanchez stars

524
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.467
in the feel-good
runaway train movie...

525
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.000
Did you have to
forget the popcorn?!

526
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.567
This is just excessive.
I told you to get the medium!

527
00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:17.500
What's this now. one of
those flash mob thingies?

528
00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:20.667
What people consider
entertainment these days!

529
00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:26.733
Stand by now.
we go live in three...

530
00:29:29.133 --> 00:29:31.000
For the first time in 20 years.

531
00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:32.900
the news
is actually interesting.

532
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.733
That is.
I'm reporting a major crime.

533
00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:39.100
The perpetrators
have staged an eruption

534
00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:40.933
of a popcorn...

535
00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:43.267
..a popcorn...

536
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.333
..a popcorn volcano

537
00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.567
that is now terrorising
the entire town.

538
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.000
Postal Service. You've got post.

539
00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:51.467
Huh?

540
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.800
-Here you go.
-Thanks so much.

541
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:55.333
What do we have here?

542
00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:57.267
"To all the citizens of Berg.

543
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.667
"I've only just begun.
so in your face.

544
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.633
"Yours truly.
the Invisible Terror.

545
00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:04.833
"Ha-ha-ha. ha-ha. ha-ha-ha. ha.

546
00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:07.000
"ha-ha. ha-ha. ha-hee-ha..."

547
00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:09.100
TV news!

548
00:30:09.133 --> 00:30:12.000
That's how I'll warn people...
Ugh!

549
00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:14.067
-Huh?
-Check this out!

550
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.867
Show the criminal's face
to everyone in Berg!

551
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.733
Look. kid. wait your turn.

552
00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:21.467
Can't you see we're on the air?

553
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.567
-Please. just take a look!
-Stop it!

554
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.100
It's the scoop of the year.

555
00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:27.333
-Not now!
-Come on. you have to see this!

556
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:28.700
Hm!

557
00:30:29.867 --> 00:30:32.933
-Hey there!
-Hm. I can't see anything.

558
00:30:32.967 --> 00:30:34.267
Nice try. young lady.

559
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.800
but now you need
to get on your merry way.

560
00:30:36.833 --> 00:30:39.167
Ha! We're back.
and we have the latest!

561
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.500
But I saw it with my own eyes.

562
00:30:42.533 --> 00:30:44.733
The case'll be solved
by smart minds.

563
00:30:44.767 --> 00:30:48.267
while you stay up to date
with handsome faces!

564
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.267
And we're out.

565
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.267
So tell me. how did I look. huh?

566
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.733
You got mostly
my good side. right?

567
00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:54.200
You can't always
count on the news.

568
00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:55.733
I've got this!

569
00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.300
Mm!

570
00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:03.433
First you invade my home.
then you take my fur.

571
00:31:03.467 --> 00:31:05.100
and now you come to me and say.

572
00:31:05.133 --> 00:31:07.067
"Please. Finnick.
"I need your help."

573
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.100
But you don't ask me
with any kind of respect

574
00:31:10.133 --> 00:31:12.467
or offer anything in return.

575
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.767
What I can offer
is a real adventure!

576
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.700
Huh? Adventure? What adventure?

577
00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:20.767
I'm a Finn.
we don't have adventures!

578
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.300
Which is why I need you to
help me catch the main suspect.

579
00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:27.133
Because I'm pretty sure
he's a Finn!

580
00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:30.033
Hm? Huh?

581
00:31:30.067 --> 00:31:31.733
I don't buy it.

582
00:31:31.767 --> 00:31:34.767
And give me one good reason
why I should help.

583
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.533
-Hey...
-Huh?

584
00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:38.600
Hey. hey!

585
00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:40.533
Because you're not just
helping me.

586
00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:42.267
you're helping the whole town.

587
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.367
How about you just save the town

588
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.833
while I wait here
in this...suitcase!

589
00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:48.267
Just think about it.

590
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.833
What can the police do
against an invisible criminal?

591
00:31:51.867 --> 00:31:55.700
Only a very brave girl and the
world's first Finn detective

592
00:31:55.733 --> 00:31:58.333
have any hope of saving Berg!

593
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.300
Well. maybe I'll help.
but only on three conditions.

594
00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:07.333
First of all.
get down on your knees...

595
00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:09.067
..and say you're sorry.

596
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.567
Secondly. I want you
to clean out my attic.

597
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.533
While on your knees.

598
00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:19.000
And thirdly. you will give me
back my fur this very instant!

599
00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:20.767
On your knees. naturally.

600
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:26.800
We catch the culprit first.
and then I'll give you your fur.

601
00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:33.600
-The fur first.
-Nope. That's not gonna work.

602
00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:36.633
Fine then!

603
00:32:36.667 --> 00:32:38.533
Haggling's not my strong suit.

604
00:32:38.567 --> 00:32:41.700
But if you trick me.
I'll hide all of your books

605
00:32:41.733 --> 00:32:43.933
and eat all of your candy.

606
00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:46.467
And I promise you'll be
inspecting every glass

607
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.633
before drinking
for the rest of your life!

608
00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:52.233
-Get it?
-Handshake?

609
00:32:53.767 --> 00:32:55.600
Paw slap.

610
00:32:55.633 --> 00:32:57.500
CHRISTINE:
The truck was right here

611
00:32:57.533 --> 00:32:59.700
when I saw the Finn jump
into it and speed away.

612
00:32:59.733 --> 00:33:05.033
You're not gonna find anything.
and you're wasting my time.

613
00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:06.367
Uh-huh. Right.

614
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.067
What do you make
of this oil stain?

615
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.767
There was once
this nasty old lady

616
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.800
who lived in my house.
like. a few years back.

617
00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:18.300
And this one time.
I spilled oil on the floor...

618
00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:20.533
It leaked from the engine!

619
00:33:20.567 --> 00:33:22.400
Can't you see. he left a trail!

620
00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:26.600
-Come on. let's follow it!

621
00:33:35.533 --> 00:33:37.100
This is the end of it.

622
00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.000
What would a detective do next?

623
00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:40.267
Think!

624
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.067
I don't suppose that you
could tell me who it is

625
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.367
if you take a little whiff
of it?

626
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.800
Take a whiff?
Do I look like a dog?!

627
00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:50.367
-No. I thought maybe you...
-Ha!

628
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.967
YOU take a whiff!

629
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Just what do you think I am?

630
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.933
You smell anything?

631
00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:03.167
Just the scent of my own shame.
And allergies.

632
00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:19.867
Finnick!

633
00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:29.533
Uh. Huh?

634
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.333
Eugh.

635
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.800
Ew. what are you doing? Eugh.

636
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.933
Oh. well. you can't say
I didn't try.

637
00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:45.933
but it's just not going to
work out.

638
00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:48.267
I'll take that fur.

639
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.267
Well...

640
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.500
-Mm...
-Chop. chop.

641
00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:54.000
Not so fast.

642
00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:58.200
You and me are never
gonna find that truck!

643
00:34:58.233 --> 00:35:00.933
This is what they mean
by "a needle in a haystack".

644
00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:04.067
Accept it. You lost. the jig
is up. the credits are rolling.

645
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.000
Game over.
Elvis has left the building.

646
00:35:06.033 --> 00:35:07.900
the carrots are cooked.
the ship has sailed.

647
00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:09.633
What else can I possibly say?

648
00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:10.900
Just turn around.

649
00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:13.033
Yeah. I've heard that one
before!

650
00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:14.633
And see. there's nothing there!

651
00:35:14.667 --> 00:35:16.600
-Whoa!
-Oh!

652
00:35:17.533 --> 00:35:19.167
-The truck!
-That's the one?

653
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.800
And we're gonna catch it!

654
00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:21.867
You serious?

655
00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:27.667
I can't believe
I signed up for this.

656
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.867
-Follow the trail! Sniff!

657
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.400
-Hang a left!

658
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:47.600
Huh. Oh!

659
00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:49.733
Mm. Ha!

660
00:35:49.767 --> 00:35:52.300
-Ha! Hey. look!

661
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:55.067
It's that hilarious cat
that walks up on its front legs!

662
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.000
I knew this was gonna go viral
as soon as I saw it!

663
00:35:58.033 --> 00:36:02.500
Do you think we can get that cat
to do your job?

664
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.567
Huh?

665
00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:31.067
Come on. keep up!

666
00:36:32.767 --> 00:36:34.933
This is as fast as I go!

667
00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:37.233
You may want to think about
taking a bike next time!

668
00:36:37.267 --> 00:36:38.833
- Welcome aboard the...
-I've got a better idea.

669
00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:40.767
-Come on! Hurry!
-..safest train in the world!

670
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.633
Your very own professional
train conductor...

671
00:36:43.667 --> 00:36:45.133
Come on! Move it. Finnick!

672
00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:48.500
..to the destination
safe and sound!

673
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.867
CHRISTINE:
We need to see the driver.

674
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.633
The truck's right there!

675
00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:02.767
Should we get out
and push the train?

676
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.900
-What now?!
-You wanted to keep up!

677
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:06.167
Real funny!

678
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.433
When we find out
who this mysterious driver is.

679
00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:10.867
then I'm gonna...

680
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.333
Oh. ow. ow. ow!

681
00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:21.633
-Come on! This way!
-What? again?

682
00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:23.800
Are all chases
so full of chasing?

683
00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:25.800
Sherlock Holmes must have been
in better shape than me.

684
00:37:25.833 --> 00:37:28.600
-Excuse me!
-Out of my way!

685
00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:30.267
What. no apology?

686
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.033
Huh? Why should I apologise
when you pushed me?!

687
00:37:33.067 --> 00:37:34.533
We can do this!

688
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.633
-Too late!
-Aw. rats!

689
00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:41.000
-The licence plate!
-I saw!

690
00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:42.500
What is it?

691
00:37:42.533 --> 00:37:45.267
It's a rectangular metal plate
with letters and numbers.

692
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.700
but I didn't have time
to read them.

693
00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:50.000
No. he's getting away!

694
00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:51.233
All is lost.

695
00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:53.467
I can't believe
that a Finn is behind this.

696
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.967
In my experience.
it's people that mess things up.

697
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.767
But what would you know
about that?

698
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.333
I know quite a lot. actually.

699
00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:04.800
I've lived in five towns.

700
00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:07.167
And I had friends
in each one of them.

701
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.033
We'd play games and hang out.
and we talked about everything.

702
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.200
And when I moved.

703
00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:15.367
did any of them even
think about calling me?

704
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.633
Hm?

705
00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:20.900
No way. I'm not like that.

706
00:38:20.933 --> 00:38:22.700
When you finally
move out of my house.

707
00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:25.233
I promise
I won't forget to call you.

708
00:38:25.267 --> 00:38:27.533
Ser-i-ous-ly...

709
00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:30.700
Ouch!

710
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.967
Next time
I'm riding in first class!

711
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.900
And it only gets better
from here!

712
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.700
Oh!

713
00:39:06.067 --> 00:39:07.933
But how...how can that be right?

714
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.033
-That's physically impossible.

715
00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:18.300
I know. but it looks so real!

716
00:39:19.633 --> 00:39:21.933
I can't believe my eyes.

717
00:39:21.967 --> 00:39:24.800
-How can there be two trains?

718
00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:26.633
Will you look at the screen
already. you nitwit?!

719
00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:28.467
Huh?

720
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.500
No. this simply
cannot be happening!

721
00:39:32.533 --> 00:39:36.133
Eastbound 74.
you must stop immediately.

722
00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:38.700
I repeat. stop immediately.
right this minute!

723
00:39:38.733 --> 00:39:40.033
We've got to stop them!

724
00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:41.367
There's another train
heading for you!

725
00:39:43.433 --> 00:39:47.000
There's no need to panic.
We covered this...in class.

726
00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:49.433
Oh! That was the class I missed!

727
00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:01.333
Attention. all!
It's time to hang on tight!

728
00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:07.633
Ugh!

729
00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:11.667
Huh? OK. everyone.

730
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.633
Panic!

731
00:40:17.867 --> 00:40:20.800
Huh? What is this?!

732
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.233
We have to get off the train!

733
00:40:24.267 --> 00:40:27.867
On the count of three. Three!

734
00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:34.367
I've never been on a train
before. Is this normal?

735
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.000
-Not exactly!

736
00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:39.767
Oh. jeez. it's not even
my shift!

737
00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.300
Well. I've got something to say
to customer service

738
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:57.800
about your train!

739
00:40:57.833 --> 00:41:00.700
Huh!
Who's got a train anymore?

740
00:41:02.067 --> 00:41:03.633
Huh? Oh!

741
00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:05.133
Pfft!

742
00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:07.400
Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh!

743
00:41:07.433 --> 00:41:11.000
Oh. hey. guys.
gonna need your help here!

744
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.533
What's going on here?
Who is this?

745
00:41:18.567 --> 00:41:20.000
Ugh!

746
00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:22.267
I've got a schedule!
You can't do...

747
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.633
What's happening?

748
00:41:54.067 --> 00:41:55.600
Oh!

749
00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:56.967
Watch out!

750
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.900
Get in here! Hurry!

751
00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:05.133
There's so much
I haven't done yet!

752
00:42:06.467 --> 00:42:07.900
Come on. come on. come on!

753
00:42:07.933 --> 00:42:10.867
You've got this! Floor it!
Faster. faster!

754
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:15.933
I didn't mean that fast!
Oh-ho-ho!

755
00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:18.400
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

756
00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:24.833
-The weather at a glance.

757
00:42:24.867 --> 00:42:27.533
On the scene in Berg.
dust and feathers swirl

758
00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:29.267
within a monstrous twister!

759
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.200
This is not a typical
weather pattern for Berg.

760
00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:37.000
Instead we find ourselves
in a dusty doomsday.

761
00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:39.167
a feathered apocalypse.
if you will!

762
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.867
-Ohhh!

763
00:42:44.767 --> 00:42:47.233
-What is happening?!

764
00:42:47.267 --> 00:42:50.567
There's so many pranks
I haven't pulled!

765
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.933
We're going to be OK.
Just calm down.

766
00:42:52.967 --> 00:42:55.267
-Not happening.
-What are you doing?!

767
00:43:02.133 --> 00:43:05.200
You're doing great. but I'm
pretty sure it's safer inside.

768
00:43:05.233 --> 00:43:08.000
Tell me. while I was gone.
did you order a hot dog?

769
00:43:08.033 --> 00:43:09.633
A hot dog? Arggh!

770
00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:11.767
Definitely not that one!

771
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.000
I won't even get to eat it!

772
00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:19.667
Just stay calm.
It's all under control!

773
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.400
Arggh!

774
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:28.367
Brace yourself!

775
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.733
We're OK.

776
00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:32.433
Whew! Huh?

777
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.933
ARGH!

778
00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:48.633
-Oh!

779
00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:50.367
-I'm so sorry!
-That does it!

780
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.800
I'm never working
overtime again!

781
00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:54.433
Take this!

782
00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:07.767
If we don't get supernatural
insurance. then I quit!

783
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.100
I'd be better off
selling hot dogs on the street!

784
00:44:19.467 --> 00:44:21.967
-Children?
-Yeah. Mom.

785
00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:32.133
A rare natural phenomenon.

786
00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:33.467
Berg is recovering

787
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.367
after a once-in-a-lifetime
feather storm.

788
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.800
Hello. Mom?
Are you guys alright?

789
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:41.100
Yeah. great!

790
00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:42.733
-You can't imagine...

791
00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:48.267
All the feathers outside.
unbelievable! Oh!

792
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.267
Walk a little slower.
why don't you?

793
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.033
It's really quite lovely.
and so strange.

794
00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:57.133
-It looks like winter.
-That is strange.

795
00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:59.000
We started filming episode 15.

796
00:44:59.033 --> 00:45:01.333
'Hot City in the Snowstorm'.
because...

797
00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:03.000
Oh!

798
00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:05.067
..everything's covered
in feathers here too.

799
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.533
Just the coincidence we needed!

800
00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:09.033
Yeah. a coincidence indeed.

801
00:45:09.067 --> 00:45:14.167
Now I understand what they say
about fast food...being heavy.

802
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.467
Let's move!

803
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.233
The natural props
are ready to go

804
00:45:17.267 --> 00:45:18.467
so you should be too!

805
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.033
By all means. take your time!

806
00:45:21.067 --> 00:45:24.167
Oh! I've gotta run!
We'll talk later.

807
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.400
Lava. snowstorms -
what will they have for us next?

808
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.067
A tsunami?

809
00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:42.267
Popcorn lava.
a snowstorm made of feathers.

810
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.733
Just like on the show!

811
00:45:44.767 --> 00:45:46.400
So?

812
00:45:46.433 --> 00:45:48.667
So this must mean
there's a Finn...

813
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.033
Or someone...

814
00:45:50.067 --> 00:45:52.333
..that's using
the plot lines from the show

815
00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:54.300
to destroy the town!

816
00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:56.533
Yeah. of course.
it's just what I thought!

817
00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:59.133
-That means someone...
-Someone...

818
00:45:59.167 --> 00:46:01.567
..who has access to
the scripts in advance

819
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.333
and drives a purple truck!

820
00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:06.733
Now we'll be able to
find out what the next crime is!

821
00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:09.233
-And prevent it. of course!
-Hey. hey!

822
00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:12.067
That's what I call
deductive technique!

823
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.533
I've cracked the case wide open!
Ha-ha!

824
00:46:14.567 --> 00:46:16.633
Come on. Watson!

825
00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.467
-Huh?

826
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.633
Finnick. we have to go
the other way.

827
00:46:21.667 --> 00:46:23.167
And where's that?

828
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.633
The place where we can find
the latest script to the show.

829
00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:28.633
Told ya!

830
00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:31.200
-Oh. am I a natural!
-Huh.

831
00:46:59.433 --> 00:47:02.067
He's already been here.

832
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.133
-Who?
-That Finn. of course! Oh.

833
00:47:04.167 --> 00:47:06.600
This is it. Yeah. Uh-huh.

834
00:47:06.633 --> 00:47:08.933
-Uh-huh.
-What's in there?

835
00:47:08.967 --> 00:47:11.200
Well. so far.

836
00:47:11.233 --> 00:47:14.300
it's just the Violet Villain
rambling on and on.

837
00:47:15.367 --> 00:47:20.000
Then dancing and singing
and juggling.

838
00:47:20.033 --> 00:47:22.000
Here he plays the bongos.

839
00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:24.567
Ah. right here! Mm-hm.

840
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.533
So? What's it say? Is it awful?

841
00:47:27.567 --> 00:47:30.200
It says there's gonna be
some kind of wheel or something

842
00:47:30.233 --> 00:47:31.600
that's gonna roll...

843
00:47:31.633 --> 00:47:33.667
Well. that's nothing!

844
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.033
We can handle that. Oh!

845
00:47:36.067 --> 00:47:38.233
I mean. you can handle that.

846
00:47:38.267 --> 00:47:40.967
And there's no way this can
threaten an entire town.

847
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.400
I mean. how bad
can a tiny wheel be?

848
00:47:46.933 --> 00:47:49.000
The Ferris wheel.

849
00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:54.367
This production is
a nightmare on film street!

850
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.533
I have to face
a new sabotage every day!

851
00:47:56.567 --> 00:48:00.000
-Let's run!
-What's going on here?

852
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.267
Hey. look!

853
00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.800
All clear.

854
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:31.833
Finnick. help me!

855
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.800
-It's so dark in here.
-Come on!

856
00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:38.667
There's got to be
evidence in there!

857
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.967
Oh. but I can't see a thing.

858
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.733
Finnick?

859
00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:57.700
No-no-no-no-no-no!

860
00:48:57.733 --> 00:49:00.900
Oh. Oh. rats!

861
00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:13.867
Oh!

862
00:49:26.933 --> 00:49:28.667
Huh?

863
00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:32.367
Almost there.

864
00:49:38.567 --> 00:49:40.167
-Finnick?
-Who's in there?

865
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.033
And how did you end up
in my truck?

866
00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:44.900
You're lucky I heard you.

867
00:49:44.933 --> 00:49:47.067
otherwise you'd be stuck
for a while.

868
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.567
What are you doing in there?

869
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.767
Oh. come on. here.
let me help you out.

870
00:49:52.867 --> 00:49:55.067
What? Did you see somebody?

871
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.633
Oh. Yeah. the house
needs a makeover. I know.

872
00:49:58.667 --> 00:50:01.967
Listen.
I need to tell you something.

873
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.167
It might sound
a little crazy. but...

874
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.233
I worked in film.
Nothing seems crazy to me.

875
00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:14.267
What do I do now?
Do I save Christine?

876
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.900
The town? Or do I save myself?

877
00:50:16.933 --> 00:50:19.000
Ohhh!

878
00:50:19.033 --> 00:50:22.633
OK. but I swear
this is the last time!

879
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.267
So you're telling me
that in every house

880
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.567
there's some kind of
invisible monster?

881
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.467
No! Finns aren't monsters.

882
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.000
Well. only yours is.
I think his name is Muffinn.

883
00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:40.200
So he's the one

884
00:50:40.233 --> 00:50:42.267
who's been committing
all these crimes.

885
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.533
and the whole town is in danger?

886
00:50:44.567 --> 00:50:45.600
Yeah.

887
00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:47.333
And he goes by
'Invisible Terror'?

888
00:50:47.367 --> 00:50:50.233
Yeah. It's sort of a lame name.

889
00:50:50.267 --> 00:50:52.500
Ha! Nobody will
ever believe this.

890
00:50:52.533 --> 00:50:53.900
Yeah. I know.

891
00:50:53.933 --> 00:50:55.400
That's because
nobody can see them

892
00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:57.067
unless they have
a piece of their fur.

893
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.700
Huh?

894
00:50:58.733 --> 00:51:00.800
Oh! Oh.

895
00:51:07.067 --> 00:51:08.467
You mean like this?

896
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.233
-The Invisible Terror!

897
00:51:12.267 --> 00:51:15.100
It's not a lame name.
We workshopped it for hours!

898
00:51:15.133 --> 00:51:18.800
So you two
are the Invisible Terror?

899
00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:20.233
Yep!

900
00:51:20.267 --> 00:51:22.333
Um. I need to use
the ladies room.

901
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.433
I'm afraid we don't have
a ladies room.

902
00:51:26.467 --> 00:51:30.167
And I'm afraid
there's no escape.

903
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.233
But why have you been
committing all these crimes?

904
00:51:35.267 --> 00:51:38.167
Aren't you the nosy one?

905
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.367
You guys are geniuses.
How do you do it?

906
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.167
Oh. now that question I like!

907
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.600
Just like a real interview!

908
00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:49.767
A true artist needs to
be able to share his process.

909
00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:54.133
No-one ever believed
in me and my talent.

910
00:51:54.167 --> 00:51:56.500
Yeah. I used to be so lonely.

911
00:51:56.533 --> 00:51:58.933
and I dreamed about
having a real friend!

912
00:51:58.967 --> 00:52:01.400
Not only that.
but they used to mock me!

913
00:52:01.433 --> 00:52:03.433
And Finnick made fun of me

914
00:52:03.467 --> 00:52:06.267
and he provoked all the others
to laugh at my human!

915
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.800
That's so awful!

916
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:10.700
Until the night
that I lost it all!

917
00:52:10.733 --> 00:52:13.667
The night
that my dream came true!

918
00:52:19.533 --> 00:52:21.867
You don't know a thing
about how to play a villain!

919
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.367
That takes an artistry
you'll never have!

920
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.867
I'd been watching fake villains
in movies and on TV

921
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.633
since I was a kid.

922
00:52:30.667 --> 00:52:33.533
And I never believed
a single word they said.

923
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:36.067
They made me sick.

924
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.433
Nothing but frauds. all of them.

925
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.533
But those who wouldn't
let real talent shine

926
00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:46.033
were the worst villains of all.

927
00:52:56.367 --> 00:52:57.700
Huh?

928
00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:04.667
Huh.

929
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.633
Hm!

930
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.633
Hm.

931
00:53:09.667 --> 00:53:11.500
Huh!

932
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.600
Hm. Ha!

933
00:53:13.633 --> 00:53:15.967
Hey there.

934
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.467
Argh!

935
00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:22.300
Brrr! It was just a dream.

936
00:53:22.333 --> 00:53:24.067
-Argh!
-How about a paw?

937
00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.000
Demon!

938
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.600
What kind of demon are you?!

939
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.933
It's OK. I'm your friend.

940
00:53:54.733 --> 00:53:57.033
I'm sorry...about your shirt.

941
00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.800
Do you think it can be fixed?

942
00:54:00.667 --> 00:54:02.833
-Yeah. not so much.
-Oh.

943
00:54:09.467 --> 00:54:11.267
My human deserves to wear

944
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.933
nothing but the very best!

945
00:54:13.967 --> 00:54:15.000
I knew then

946
00:54:15.033 --> 00:54:17.000
I wasn't alone anymore!

947
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.500
-Brrr!

948
00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:22.133
It was then that I knew.

949
00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:25.067
If people thought that I was
no good as an actor

950
00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.800
and I could never make it
as a convincing villain...

951
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.400
..then I would show them

952
00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:36.200
exactly what kind of
evil supervillain I had inside!

953
00:54:36.233 --> 00:54:38.467
-This town is mine!
-Oh!

954
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.100
-Breathtaking! Genius!
-Why. thank you.

955
00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:44.233
Huh? Where are you going?

956
00:54:44.267 --> 00:54:47.633
-Um. but why this town?

957
00:54:47.667 --> 00:54:49.767
Oh!

958
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.200
Oh. unfortunately.
your time is up. I gotta run.

959
00:55:01.267 --> 00:55:03.200
Would you like to know
what comes next?

960
00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:05.067
No spoilers here! Ha!

961
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.533
Only in the movies
does the villain

962
00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:08.667
confess his entire plan
in act three.

963
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.200
I already know.

964
00:55:10.233 --> 00:55:12.567
-You're using the wheel.
-How'd you know that?

965
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.933
Acting out the script
from that TV show is obvious.

966
00:55:14.967 --> 00:55:18.267
But the script has been through
several rewrites.

967
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.400
You're gonna love
the new Ferris wheel sequence.

968
00:55:21.433 --> 00:55:24.333
It'll be
the 'roll' of a lifetime!

969
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.067
Boo!

970
00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.367
That looks just like a...

971
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.400
Yeah. like a costume
made out of real Finn fur.

972
00:55:47.433 --> 00:55:50.200
Of course. we had to shear a few
Finns to make this masterpiece.

973
00:55:50.233 --> 00:55:53.233
-Yep. yep. had to.

974
00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:55.700
CHRISTINE:
I almost didn't recognise them!

975
00:55:57.167 --> 00:55:59.300
Slimfinn.

976
00:55:59.333 --> 00:56:00.367
Frogfinn.

977
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.367
After we shaved 'em.

978
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.800
they went totally cuckoo.

979
00:56:02.833 --> 00:56:06.567
Just like JB always says.
"Real art requires sacrifice!"

980
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.600
Every day he seems more and more
like a real Finn to me.

981
00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:12.067
Yeah. and in this get-up.
I'm invisible!

982
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.433
The fur makes me itch
like crazy. I'm tellin' you.

983
00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:19.333
but as I always say.
art requires sacrifice.

984
00:56:19.367 --> 00:56:21.500
Still whining
about our fur. are we?

985
00:56:21.533 --> 00:56:23.900
Did you know that Finns
are just wild about ice cream?

986
00:56:23.933 --> 00:56:26.567
Mm!

987
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.233
-What?

988
00:56:32.267 --> 00:56:34.367
Ohhh!

989
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.200
-Hey. you. let my human go!
-Finnick!

990
00:56:41.233 --> 00:56:43.700
Or else you'll see me
go totally loco!

991
00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.233
Oh.

992
00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:48.300
Yeah. you let her go right now
or else I'm...

993
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:50.267
..gonna get Finnicky!

994
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.967
You're no match for me!
I'm crazy strong!

995
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.467
-Give up now!

996
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.200
I suppose I could always use
a little more fur.

997
00:56:58.233 --> 00:56:59.533
Finnick!

998
00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:06.033
Didn't I mention

999
00:57:06.067 --> 00:57:08.333
that I used to be
a member of the hunting club?

1000
00:57:08.367 --> 00:57:10.667
Yep. I carried
all the hunters' bags.

1001
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.100
Just let her go.
She's totally bonkers!

1002
00:57:13.133 --> 00:57:14.267
No-one's gonna
believe her story.

1003
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.267
You've got no need for Finnick!

1004
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.000
His fur's gonna
wreck your costume!

1005
00:57:18.033 --> 00:57:19.767
My fur is fabulous!

1006
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.800
Get this lunatic out of here!

1007
00:57:21.833 --> 00:57:23.933
Yeah. fabulous
if you like fleas!

1008
00:57:23.967 --> 00:57:25.800
Alas. we've run out of time.
so I guess

1009
00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:28.233
I'll have to shave
the plump one on the way there.

1010
00:57:28.267 --> 00:57:30.833
I am not plump. I am fluffy!

1011
00:57:32.467 --> 00:57:34.300
Listen to me. you let her go!

1012
00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:41.533
I'm the only one
who gets to see Finns.

1013
00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:45.033
Sorry. your fairytale
had to end.

1014
00:57:45.067 --> 00:57:46.400
Forever.

1015
00:58:07.967 --> 00:58:10.567
MUFFINN:
You weren't really serious?

1016
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.600
But of course.
I was deadly serious.

1017
00:58:13.633 --> 00:58:16.933
But the houses. I mean.
you wouldn't hurt them. right?

1018
00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:19.867
You wouldn't just throw
the Ferris wheel at the town?

1019
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.033
Well. of course not. silly!

1020
00:58:22.067 --> 00:58:24.600
I'm gonna roll it at the town!

1021
00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:26.800
-What?
-This will be unforgettable!

1022
00:58:26.833 --> 00:58:28.967
I can't wait
to see my name in lights!

1023
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.033
All art requires sacrifice.

1024
00:58:31.067 --> 00:58:33.267
When were you going
to tell me about this?

1025
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.733
Um. how about now?

1026
00:58:35.767 --> 00:58:37.900
But if you destroy
all the homes.

1027
00:58:37.933 --> 00:58:40.100
that means you'll
also destroy all the Finns.

1028
00:58:40.133 --> 00:58:41.267
Remember?

1029
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.133
Not every story
has a happy ending

1030
00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:45.267
and no-one's gonna suffer.
I promise.

1031
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.833
We're villains.
not animals!

1032
00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:53.500
Let me outta here. you animals!

1033
00:58:56.633 --> 00:59:00.800
I...have to save Finnick...
and the town!

1034
00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:08.033
It's good that my parents
are actors

1035
00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:11.033
'cause it's taught me
to take care of myself.

1036
00:59:11.067 --> 00:59:13.133
It's locked.

1037
00:59:13.167 --> 00:59:14.700
Right.

1038
00:59:14.733 --> 00:59:17.700
If I were Sherlock Holmes.
what would I do?

1039
00:59:20.267 --> 00:59:22.533
Oh! Are you kidding me?!

1040
00:59:22.567 --> 00:59:24.500
Were they having a sale
on bars?!

1041
00:59:35.433 --> 00:59:37.700
I refuse to let you do this!

1042
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:42.700
And I refuse
to let you stop me!

1043
00:59:44.167 --> 00:59:45.200
Whoa!

1044
00:59:46.633 --> 00:59:48.067
Whoa!

1045
00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.133
This time. my friend.
art requires sacri-FUR!

1046
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:57.033
No! No! No!

1047
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.967
You stay here for now.

1048
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.533
And you. wiggle on over here.

1049
01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:14.100
You're long overdue
for a haircut.

1050
01:00:14.133 --> 01:00:17.133
And now you're going to get it.

1051
01:00:19.667 --> 01:00:21.933
Wait. Just wait.

1052
01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:23.667
It's not that long.

1053
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.300
I'd rather have it cut
by a professional.

1054
01:00:34.867 --> 01:00:37.100
I know something you want.

1055
01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:41.367
Come on.

1056
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.500
Dessert?

1057
01:00:43.533 --> 01:00:44.733
Hey. you guys!

1058
01:00:44.767 --> 01:00:47.900
Anyone want ice cream?
Cool and yummy!

1059
01:00:47.933 --> 01:00:49.133
Here they come!

1060
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.233
Right this way!

1061
01:00:52.267 --> 01:00:53.900
Go get it!

1062
01:00:56.133 --> 01:00:57.700
It worked!

1063
01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.933
There's no telling just
what Finns are capable of.

1064
01:01:07.467 --> 01:01:09.533
Don't worry.
I'll give you a trendy trim.

1065
01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:11.367
You've got no beef with me.

1066
01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.867
But I've got beef with you!

1067
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.867
Whoa!

1068
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.733
Arggh!

1069
01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:23.500
Oh! No. no. no. no. no!

1070
01:01:23.533 --> 01:01:25.733
Yeesh. I was only
gonna give him a haircut.

1071
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.467
Whoa!

1072
01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.700
I've been meaning to
get that leak repaired.

1073
01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:33.800
But perhaps it's best I didn't.

1074
01:01:36.967 --> 01:01:38.833
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

1075
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:42.800
I wish I could stick around
for the bonfire.

1076
01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:45.300
but I never was
one for barbecue.

1077
01:01:51.633 --> 01:01:54.567
You have got to get out of here!

1078
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.767
Now. think like
you're Christine.

1079
01:02:02.067 --> 01:02:03.733
Uh...

1080
01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:05.233
It's time to go now!

1081
01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:08.300
So you're having
a bad hair day. It'll grow.

1082
01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:15.200
Too tight.

1083
01:02:15.233 --> 01:02:17.600
Just one more inch.

1084
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.667
That's it. Gotta cut down
on the doughnuts.

1085
01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.767
-Hey. Muffinn!
-Huh?

1086
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.667
Wanna lend a paw here?

1087
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.533
Hi!

1088
01:02:28.567 --> 01:02:32.633
-Oh. what's wrong with you?!
-Yay!

1089
01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.567
Ah. well. at least
you're still here. right?

1090
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.767
-Huh?

1091
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.600
Huh?

1092
01:02:51.967 --> 01:02:54.300
Arggh!

1093
01:03:04.533 --> 01:03:08.567
So it wasn't the most graceful
escape. but it works for me.

1094
01:03:35.767 --> 01:03:39.467
Hey. you guys.
My name is Christine.

1095
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.167
I'm Finnick's friend.

1096
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.767
I know that it's your.
um. weekly meeting today

1097
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.000
and I know you're here.

1098
01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:49.100
-No! Please don't leave!

1099
01:03:49.133 --> 01:03:50.133
Just hear me out!

1100
01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:52.267
JB. the guy with Muffinn.

1101
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.900
he kidnaps Finns!

1102
01:03:55.733 --> 01:03:58.800
He's shaving off all
their hair and harming them.

1103
01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:02.867
And there's more. JB caused
all of Berg's disasters.

1104
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.233
Now he plans
to crush the whole town

1105
01:04:05.267 --> 01:04:07.833
with the Ferris wheel
from the amusement park.

1106
01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:09.167
Your town will be destroyed!

1107
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.833
Your houses will be ruined.

1108
01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:13.167
Finns and your humans
will be hurt!

1109
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200
We have got to stop this!

1110
01:04:15.233 --> 01:04:16.967
And we can if we act together!

1111
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.800
Together!

1112
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.900
Yeah. I know it's against all
your rules to even talk to me.

1113
01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:30.333
But Finnick broke the rules.
and I've broken my rules

1114
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.633
to never get too comfortable
in a new town

1115
01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:34.367
and never make real friends.

1116
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.833
I'm guilty as charged!
But JB has kidnapped Finnick!

1117
01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:42.400
And Finnick is my best friend.
who I don't want to lose!

1118
01:04:42.433 --> 01:04:44.533
You know how special he is!

1119
01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:48.600
Please help me.
I can't do it alone.

1120
01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:59.833
-Oh!
-Mm.

1121
01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.500
Mm.

1122
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.000
I think I need a hug!

1123
01:05:15.033 --> 01:05:18.033
And to think
I was gonna stay home.

1124
01:05:18.067 --> 01:05:19.600
Time to join together!

1125
01:05:19.633 --> 01:05:22.167
Sure. it's against our bylaws.

1126
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.133
We've vowed
never to reveal ourselves.

1127
01:05:25.167 --> 01:05:28.667
But now our way of life
depends on that very thing!

1128
01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.567
You broke the rules.
and so can we.

1129
01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:35.600
I trust you with this.

1130
01:05:36.567 --> 01:05:38.600
Huh? Whoa!

1131
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.400
That JB is no match for us!

1132
01:05:47.433 --> 01:05:50.133
We just have to seize his fur
suit and get that bracelet.

1133
01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:52.200
and we can leave the rest
to the police!

1134
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.400
Let's teach this guy
some manners!

1135
01:05:56.533 --> 01:05:59.600
-I just hope we make it!

1136
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.900
Whee!

1137
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.167
Huh!

1138
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.733
Today I'm the star.

1139
01:06:21.767 --> 01:06:25.800
I was born to play the villain.
no directors necessary.

1140
01:06:27.933 --> 01:06:31.633
But as I always say.
real art requires sacrifice.

1141
01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:35.100
Hey. man.
you got a problem with us?

1142
01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:37.467
Excuse me? Excuse you!

1143
01:06:40.567 --> 01:06:41.667
Oh!

1144
01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:44.967
Ah! Oh! Mm!

1145
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.800
I need ice cream!

1146
01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.333
Not now! Gotta go.

1147
01:06:50.433 --> 01:06:52.000
This thing
should have an elevator.

1148
01:06:52.033 --> 01:06:53.567
Where do my tax dollars go?!

1149
01:07:02.067 --> 01:07:03.100
Finally.

1150
01:07:04.633 --> 01:07:07.467
It's nearly showtime!

1151
01:07:08.467 --> 01:07:11.233
This moment calls for
an evil laugh.

1152
01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.067
Whew!

1153
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.367
Oh! Oh!

1154
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.567
Arggh!

1155
01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:43.367
Ugh!

1156
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.567
Not you again!

1157
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.400
Well. if it isn't
the Invisible Id-i-ot!

1158
01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:50.800
My name
is the Invisible Terror!

1159
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.167
Whoa.

1160
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.200
I should have shaved you
when I had the chance!

1161
01:08:02.467 --> 01:08:03.500
Give me that!

1162
01:08:06.533 --> 01:08:09.700
-Let me go!
-With pleasure!

1163
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.200
-Huh? Oh!

1164
01:08:13.233 --> 01:08:16.100
Now. stop trying
to steal my scene!

1165
01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:19.267
Huh? What? Again?

1166
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.200
I hate
to break it to you.

1167
01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:23.533
but you're the worst barber
of all time!

1168
01:08:26.933 --> 01:08:28.267
Ow!

1169
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.100
Take this! Take that!

1170
01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:38.033
Now stay there. Huh!

1171
01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:40.300
The lighter!

1172
01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:42.500
You looking for this?

1173
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.033
Look up there. it's a fire!

1174
01:08:51.067 --> 01:08:52.567
-Whoa!
-Yeah. why not?

1175
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.333
I'm commandeering
your binoculars.

1176
01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:05.867
Huh?

1177
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.600
This might be the first time
in a hundred years

1178
01:09:08.633 --> 01:09:10.433
Berg has a criminal!

1179
01:09:10.467 --> 01:09:13.400
Somebody call the police!
Wait a minute. I am the police!

1180
01:09:13.433 --> 01:09:15.133
Look at what you've done!

1181
01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:17.500
Alright. let's have it your way!

1182
01:09:17.533 --> 01:09:20.800
The audience deserves
to see me in full costume!

1183
01:09:28.567 --> 01:09:33.300
Here comes the really fun part!
Whoo!

1184
01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:34.967
-Oh!

1185
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.267
You've got a front row seat.
don't you?

1186
01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:41.267
Arggh!

1187
01:09:44.433 --> 01:09:45.533
Ugh.

1188
01:09:45.567 --> 01:09:47.567
We're too late!

1189
01:09:57.767 --> 01:09:59.733
Finnick?

1190
01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:01.433
Finnick!

1191
01:10:02.867 --> 01:10:04.400
Wah...

1192
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.000
At least now
we can skip the Zipper.

1193
01:10:10.033 --> 01:10:13.900
Enjoy the show!

1194
01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:19.533
Plus the sequel next season.
The national tour!

1195
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.100
Oh! Eugh. Come on!

1196
01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:32.267
Huh?

1197
01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:35.533
Arggh!

1198
01:10:35.567 --> 01:10:36.767
Oh!

1199
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.767
Where do you think
you're going?

1200
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.600
Christine?
What are you doing here?

1201
01:10:40.633 --> 01:10:42.167
Just exploring the town.

1202
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.533
Ohhh!

1203
01:10:50.867 --> 01:10:53.667
My house
will be the first to go!

1204
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.000
It's the only home I've known.

1205
01:10:56.033 --> 01:10:58.733
Nope!
That is not going to happen.

1206
01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:00.233
Now. what are you waiting for?

1207
01:11:00.267 --> 01:11:01.700
Move it. already!

1208
01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:04.933
FINN DRIVER:
What. are you blind?

1209
01:11:04.967 --> 01:11:06.533
Can't you see my blinker?

1210
01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:09.867
We haven't got all day here!
Get out of my way!

1211
01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.000
-We'll never make it!
-Oh. yes. we will!

1212
01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:20.633
Everybody...hang onto your fur!

1213
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.333
What in the world?

1214
01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:32.333
Push like the wind!
Like you're Finns!

1215
01:11:33.733 --> 01:11:36.000
This was not
in the script!

1216
01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:38.000
-Wha... Huh?

1217
01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.567
You can't stop me!
Oh. gross!

1218
01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:56.233
You've got to keep
piling them up! Right there!

1219
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.933
To the right! The right!

1220
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.833
Arggh!

1221
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.267
That was a close one!

1222
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.200
To the left! Go left!

1223
01:12:14.233 --> 01:12:16.300
-They said left!
-All together!

1224
01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:20.733
Go. go. go!
Let's do this together!

1225
01:12:20.767 --> 01:12:22.967
I can hold it off...

1226
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.400
Whoa!

1227
01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:30.033
Where'd it go?

1228
01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:35.967
Whoa!

1229
01:12:39.933 --> 01:12:41.333
-Whoa!

1230
01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:49.000
Ha-ha! Hit the road. wheel!

1231
01:12:49.033 --> 01:12:51.433
This Finn is on a roll!

1232
01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:54.867
-You actually did it. partner!
-Was there ever any doubt?

1233
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.433
-Well. maybe just a little.
-Hang on. I'm coming.

1234
01:12:57.467 --> 01:13:00.333
I'm running!
Or rather. I'm falling!

1235
01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:01.433
Whoa!

1236
01:13:05.267 --> 01:13:07.367
CHRISTINE:
OK. so now what's the plan?

1237
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.467
I haven't exactly
figured that out yet!

1238
01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:15.733
Alright. are we all set?

1239
01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:18.433
Wait! Where are my new actors?

1240
01:13:18.467 --> 01:13:20.200
-Present!
-Then get on my set!

1241
01:13:20.233 --> 01:13:22.600
-Yes. sir! Here we come!
-Oh. wow! Happily!

1242
01:13:22.633 --> 01:13:24.100
-Oh.

1243
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.633
What is that?

1244
01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:29.833
Mom. Dad! What's up?

1245
01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:31.967
-Christine!
-It's Christine!

1246
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.667
Nobody told me about
the new prop. did they?

1247
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.867
I don't know. But I'll add it
to the props list!

1248
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.933
Christine!

1249
01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:39.367
What are you doing
in there?

1250
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.867
Just hanging out.

1251
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.133
-What?
-Right.

1252
01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:45.867
This calls for stunt 85.

1253
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.833
-We're coming. sweetie!
-Everything will be fine.

1254
01:13:48.867 --> 01:13:50.000
Don't worry.

1255
01:13:50.033 --> 01:13:52.100
Time for stunt one-oh...

1256
01:13:52.133 --> 01:13:53.833
Oh! This one never works!

1257
01:13:53.867 --> 01:13:56.000
-Whoa!

1258
01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:01.967
-Christine. don't let go!
-I've got you!

1259
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.533
And I've got you!

1260
01:14:03.567 --> 01:14:05.200
And I've got all of you!

1261
01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:07.967
I knew the circus training
would come in handy!

1262
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.467
What a shot! I got it!

1263
01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:20.033
-We all intact?
-Nearly.

1264
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.767
My baby.
you're safe and sound with us!

1265
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.133
We love you so much. Christine!

1266
01:14:39.167 --> 01:14:42.300
And I love you. all of you.

1267
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400
Technology is a curse!

1268
01:14:48.433 --> 01:14:51.667
I had the thing in video mode
so why didn't it record?!

1269
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.600
Tell me somebody got that!

1270
01:14:54.633 --> 01:14:57.167
-Eh.

1271
01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.467
P.A.: Citizens of Berg!
Please keep calm!

1272
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.933
The situation is under control.

1273
01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.167
Why didn't I just go
to Hollywood?

1274
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.600
They know real talent
when they see it.

1275
01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.833
Scram! And stay there! Huh?

1276
01:15:15.867 --> 01:15:19.000
You'll never understand
what real art is.

1277
01:15:19.033 --> 01:15:20.567
Actually. I'm a film buff.

1278
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.933
Ah! He had time to put on
a bracelet but not pants?

1279
01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:28.600
They'll talk about
my performance for years!

1280
01:15:28.633 --> 01:15:31.167
-A villain for the ages!

1281
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.667
Might I get some heat back here?
My feet are freezing.

1282
01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:47.133
Ah. well.
I guess that's over now.

1283
01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:49.400
Uh-huh. that's a wrap.

1284
01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:55.533
Now we can go our separate ways
and just get back to our lives.

1285
01:15:55.567 --> 01:15:58.200
Yeah. we can.

1286
01:15:58.233 --> 01:16:01.133
And I guess that I won't
see you from now on.

1287
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.433
Deal's a deal.
I intend to keep my promise.

1288
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.933
What am I supposed to do
with that?

1289
01:16:14.967 --> 01:16:16.800
As if that could ever be my fur.

1290
01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.367
JB took your fur from me
and so I thought I'd...

1291
01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.933
Rob an old Finn of the only fur
he's got left? Bleugh.

1292
01:16:23.967 --> 01:16:26.633
Plus that colour washes you out.
Huh.

1293
01:16:28.267 --> 01:16:30.567
This'll look better on you.

1294
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.833
Be careful with it.
It took me all day to braid.

1295
01:16:37.867 --> 01:16:40.033
Give the other one
back to Grandpops.

1296
01:16:40.067 --> 01:16:42.167
He needs all the fur he can get.

1297
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.800
-OK. moving on.
-Does this mean...

1298
01:16:47.133 --> 01:16:49.067
..that I could be...

1299
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:53.067
..like. your favourite human
or something?

1300
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.067
Well. obviously. Duh!

1301
01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.400
My B...FF!

1302
01:16:58.433 --> 01:17:01.933
-Best Finn Forever!

1303
01:17:01.967 --> 01:17:05.433
OK. OK. that's enough now.

1304
01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:07.700
Let's get down to business!

1305
01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:21.433
-Now. this is fun!
-Yeah. ha-ha!

1306
01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:30.733
Ooh! Hey.
thanks for the hyper speed!

1307
01:17:30.767 --> 01:17:32.433
That's the only way to ride it.

1308
01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:45.300
The formula doesn't have
any side effects so far. right?

1309
01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.933
Just itching. bloating and gas.

1310
01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:50.400
Ha-ha! Nope. no side effects
to see here.

1311
01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:53.800
Oh. I feel my fur
coming back to me!

1312
01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:57.833
The town! The Ferris wheel!
JB! How could I?

1313
01:17:57.867 --> 01:18:00.033
I can barely remember it!

1314
01:18:00.067 --> 01:18:02.767
All I know is
I'm addicted to ice cream.

1315
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.533
Oh. ice cream?
Did somebody say ice cream?

1316
01:18:05.567 --> 01:18:08.600
-I want some!
-Sh! Now calm down and breathe.

1317
01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:10.733
You'll all get your ice cream.
but dinner comes first.

1318
01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:29.100
Oh. look at us go!

1319
01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:31.600
Not too fast now!

1320
01:18:31.633 --> 01:18:33.200
Finally a day off!

1321
01:18:35.567 --> 01:18:38.067
Hey. you guys. should
we do this again tomorrow?

1322
01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.167
What do you say?

1323
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.067
Whew!

1324
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.000
Thank goodness I found you!

1325
01:18:45.033 --> 01:18:46.533
Christine!

1326
01:18:46.567 --> 01:18:48.933
Listen. we're not working.
Today is our day off.

1327
01:18:48.967 --> 01:18:52.200
Yeah. but you've been cast
in a brand-new project!

1328
01:18:52.233 --> 01:18:54.300
Uh...what?

1329
01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:55.967
-Wait till you read this script.
-Listen. um...

1330
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.467
-I've got tickets for the...
-Movies?

1331
01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.000
-Yeah! For. uh...
-Tomorrow?

1332
01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:04.100
Yeah! I thought that maybe
you'd like to go with...

1333
01:19:04.133 --> 01:19:05.600
-..to go with...
-It's a deal!

1334
01:19:05.633 --> 01:19:07.300
Hey. wait.
how did you know all that?

1335
01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.167
Is it a yes or a no?

1336
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.800
-Oh. just say yes!
-The leading roles?

1337
01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:13.667
Yes. yes. yes!

1338
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.333
You know what this means.
don't you. babe?

1339
01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:17.967
We can afford to fix the house?

1340
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.400
Fix it?

1341
01:19:19.433 --> 01:19:22.367
-We can afford to buy it!
-Should I take that as a yes?

1342
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.400
-Oh. we're not sure.
-Much to discuss.

1343
01:19:25.433 --> 01:19:27.033
-I guess we could.
-Yeah.

1344
01:19:27.067 --> 01:19:29.267
Don't even try for overtime.

1345
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.767
That's right.
and we also need weekends off

1346
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.933
to spend time with
our beautiful daughter!

1347
01:19:33.967 --> 01:19:38.033
-Christine!
-Ah! Oh!

1348
01:19:38.067 --> 01:19:39.567
Yes!

1349
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.933
-Get lost!

1350
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.167
Yeah. I get it!

1351
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.200
These days every home
has to have a series of gadgets.

1352
01:19:59.233 --> 01:20:02.500
A smart TV. a shower with wi-fi

1353
01:20:02.533 --> 01:20:05.600
and all these talking boxes.

1354
01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:07.667
But who really takes care
of the house?

1355
01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.833
That would be me. That's my job.

1356
01:20:09.867 --> 01:20:15.233
Huh? Oh. Hey. Room-bot. you've
only vacuumed two times today!

1357
01:20:15.267 --> 01:20:18.033
I'm watching you.
No shirkers allowed!

1358
01:20:18.067 --> 01:20:20.767
Huh? Oh! They're coming.
They're coming!

1359
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.633
Hey. you. blabber-mouth.

1360
01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:24.733
uh. Smart-bot.
please play music.

1361
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.533
No-no-no-no-no!
Something softer!

1362
01:20:29.567 --> 01:20:32.133
-SMART-BOT: I'm on it.
-Must I teach you everything?

1363
01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:33.767
You know.

1364
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.800
you really had me shaking
in that last scene!

1365
01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.867
I had no idea you were
gonna make that choice!

1366
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.000
The whole crew
had their mouths wide open!

1367
01:20:41.033 --> 01:20:43.300
I can't believe
you nailed it in one take!

1368
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.000
By the way.
was that in the script?

1369
01:20:48.033 --> 01:20:50.200
No. it was just us.

1370
01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.100
-Did you get it?
-I sure did.

1371
01:20:54.133 --> 01:20:55.467
You're the best.

1372
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.200
It's so nice to be home!

1373
01:20:58.233 --> 01:21:00.467
That's 'cause you've got me
as your Finn!

1374
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.767
Our home is so cute
and cuddly now.

1375
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.167
Indeed!

1376
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.333
Yeah. it's as if
some invisible presence

1377
01:21:06.367 --> 01:21:07.800
is looking after us.

1378
01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.933
While making our home
so cosy!

1379
01:21:09.967 --> 01:21:12.600
Hey. Smart-bot. what's
the secret to a cosy home?

1380
01:21:12.633 --> 01:21:14.633
Ha! Like she has any idea!

1381
01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:16.467
SMART-BOT: Finns are
the protectors of the home.

1382
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.633
Most people have never seen
a Finn before.

1383
01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:22.133
There are many different Finns
in houses all over the world.

1384
01:21:22.167 --> 01:21:23.900
The Finn in our house
is called Finnick.

1385
01:21:23.933 --> 01:21:25.967
What are you doing?!

1386
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.567
Christine. how will you
ever eat all that ice cream?

1387
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.400
Well. I happen to have
some friends

1388
01:21:32.433 --> 01:21:34.733
who just go crazy for it.

1389
01:21:37.433 --> 01:21:39.333
Yeah!

1390
01:21:43.433 --> 01:21:46.567
Yes. I'm still
having problems with you.

1391
01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.400
And if you really don't get it.

1392
01:21:48.433 --> 01:21:50.400
then I will tell you
one more time.

1393
01:21:50.433 --> 01:21:54.267
I am a Finn.
You're more like a techno-Finn.

1394
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.800

01:21:58.833 --> 01:22:01.867
But I'm the boss. got it?

1396
01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.300

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:06.067
Good. or you'll end up
like the toaster.

1398
01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.267
I'm watching you.

1399
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.300
Leave me alone!

1400
01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:36.667

1401
01:25:39.867 --> 01:25:42.433

1403
01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:43.367
