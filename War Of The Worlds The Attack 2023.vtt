3
00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.498
Before it happened.

4
00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.334
no one would have believed that
our world was being watched.

5
00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.219
Watched keenly and closely

6
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.680
by intelligences
far greater than us.

7
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.728
Scrutinizing us

8
00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.314
as we do cells
under a microscope.

9
00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:19.246
and yet.
across the gulf of space.

10
00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.916
an enemy regarded this earth
with their envious eyes.

11
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.629
And slowly and surely.

12
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.881
drew their plans against us.

13
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.467
Whoa.

14
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:14.801
-Sorry.
-A little warning.

15
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:17.971
Well?

16
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.436
We're on course.

17
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.230
This way.

18
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.819
When did you see it. Hannah?

19
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.447
About two hours ago.

20
00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.990
just a green light

21
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.618
-passing through the sky.
-Green?

22
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:41.870
Aren't meteors
supposed to be white or yellow?

23
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.413
Maybe it's the aliens.

24
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.123
I think I believe
Dr. Stint. Ogilvy.

25
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.541
We're certainly
not alone in this universe.

26
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.834
Dr. Stint.

27
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.586
Why don't you believe her?

28
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.213
All right. Look.

29
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.298
I respect some of her work.

30
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.217
but truthfully speaking.

31
00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.928
she has a lot
of crackpot ideas and--

32
00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:00.180
Dr. Stint is a leading
astronomer in England.

33
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.515
and we're lucky
to have her at UCL.

34
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.891
We are lucky to have her at UCL.

35
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.184
Oh. shut up.
You're such a child.

36
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.311
Guys. Let's not waste time.

37
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.354
Let's keep going.

38
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.315
Oh. finger.

39
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:11.650
-Oh. shut up.
-My feelings.

40
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.818
Uh-huh.

41
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.489
Not far now.

42
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.698
Thank Christ for that.

43
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.991
My legs are dead.

44
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.795
We have made it
through the woods. boys.

45
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.338
I'll tell you in five minutes

46
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.714
if I've made it through
the woods or not.

47
00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.882
Wait. Where's Herb?

48
00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.427
What? Right behind us.

49
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.595
-Herb?
-Come on.

50
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.973
-Herb!
-Herbert.

51
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.142
-Herb!
-Herby!

52
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.768
What?

53
00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.731
Ogi!

54
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.983
Jesus! You scared
the life out of me.

55
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.401
What on Earth
are you doing here?

56
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.987
I thought I saw a...

57
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.697
Come on. let's go.

58
00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:43.909
All right.

59
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.290
Sorry. guys.

60
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.750
You all right there. buddy?

61
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.126
You know what?

62
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.507
I think I've got
a theory about this.

63
00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.050
Oh. here we go. Here we go.

64
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.468
-No. I have--
-We've got a theory again.

65
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.469
Where's the camera?
Bring it out.

66
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.637
Yes. Have to get this.

67
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.638
At this time. I have to say it.

68
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:05.805
For posterity.

69
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.307
Okay.

70
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.558
Go.

71
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.768
Okay. What I'm saying is

72
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.603
hypothetically.

73
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.230
what if Martians exist?

74
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.399
Okay.
So whatever I saw tonight

75
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.692
definitely wasn't a meteor.

76
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.194
Exactly. exactly.

77
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.862
exactly. it wasn't a meteor.
was it?

78
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.405
So what could it have been?

79
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.741
It could have been
a probe. a rocket.

80
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.284
We could be dealing
with a Martian invasion.

81
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.702
All right. Okay.

82
00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.789
just calm down.
tin foil hat man.

83
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.875
Herbert. I love you.

84
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:38.547
But if life on Mars
even existed.

85
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.840
it's long extinct.

86
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.510
Mars is just
a big dusty graveyard.

87
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.303
We'll see. Ogi.

88
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.681
We will see.

89
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.140
Well. you tried
to teach these kids.

90
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.184
Try to raise them right.

91
00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.353
Unbelievable.

92
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.448
Whoa.

93
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.367
Would you stop doing that?

94
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.494
-What is wrong?
-GPS is dead.

95
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.123
Might as well call it a night.

96
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.583
But we're so close.

97
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.626
It's pitch black.
navigation is gone.

98
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.503
could be anywhere
within two-mile radius.

99
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.754
Fine.

100
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.464
We can stay at my mom's.

101
00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.882
She doesn't live far from here.

102
00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:23.883
We'll start early
in the morning.

103
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.010
Oh. stay at yours.

104
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.595
Relax. I'll be there too.

105
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.305
Oh. now you're making it
sound worse.

106
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.849
Look. we can charge
your GPS and start early.

107
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.309
Let's just go. yes?

108
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.271
Hey. Coming.

109
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.374
Good morning. everyone.

110
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.586
It is nine o'clock
on 17th October.

111
00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.504
And we were supposed to be

112
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.174
the early bird
catching our meteor

113
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.010
but our super.

114
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.472
super enthusiastic astronomer

115
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.349
is still asleep. Nice close up.

116
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.100
Very nice. very nice.

117
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.935
-Now. Herb.
-Yes?

118
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.855
-Would you please do the honors?
-Of course.

119
00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.317
Asshole!

120
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.282
Yeah. I'm letting you get away
with this this time.

121
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.492
Yeah. all right.

122
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.165
God. Hannah. stop being weird.

123
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.209
This is for documenting
our work. yeah?

124
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.419
Not for silly pranks.

125
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.339
Herbert. are you coming?

126
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.924
Yeah. I'm here.

127
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.258
Morning. sweetie.

128
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.593
Morning.

129
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:49.803
Did you sleep well?

130
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.221
Yeah. fine.

131
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.223
Are you guys
off out again today?

132
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.726
Uh. yeah. hopefully.
find something interesting.

133
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.687
And what time do you think
you'll be home?

134
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.355
Uh. I don't know.

135
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.023
It depends on what we get up to.

136
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.400
Well. I'm going to
Leatherhead this afternoon

137
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.026
to see your Uncle Tom.

138
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.612
-Okay.
-You sure to make it. won't you?

139
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.823
I'll try.

140
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.283
-What do you mean you'll try?
-I mean I'll try.

141
00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.160
Your Uncle Tom's done a lot
for us since your dad--

142
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.870
Mom. leave it.

143
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.707
Look. it's not far to cycle

144
00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:21.209
or you can catch a bus
and meet me there.

145
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.087
Yeah. Just leave it. okay?

146
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.714
-I'll try and make it.
-Your dad and Tom

147
00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.632
had the same passions
that you've got now.

148
00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.217
And Tom might be
the closest connection

149
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.302
-you've got to your father.
-Mom.

150
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.846
the only connection
I had with dad
was that bloody telescope.

151
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.847
Just leave it. okay?

152
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:34.848
Herbert.

153
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:35.890
Herbert. listen!

154
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.522
Hey. Ellie.

155
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.274
Morning. gorgeous.

156
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.483
How have you been?

157
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.693
Good. thanks.

158
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.986
Busy with work.

159
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.072
Great.

160
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.160
You made pancakes.

161
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.871
Yeah. Yeah. yeah.
sit down and get them

162
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.205
before they get cold.

163
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.875
Where's Ogilvy?

164
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.209
He's in the bathroom.

165
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.211
Okay.

166
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.882
I'll get Herbert.

167
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.010
Thanks. Hannah.

168
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.770
Hey.

169
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.733
So. here you are.

170
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.576
What's that?

171
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.203
It's a walkie-talkie.

172
00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.415
Is it your dad's?

173
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.463
Yeah.

174
00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:53.635
He used to love everything
sort of radios and signals.

175
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.806
We used to just. sort of.

176
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.974
listen to random frequencies

177
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.644
and he always used to brag

178
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.270
that we might come across
some Russian spies

179
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.439
up to no good or something.

180
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.441
Hey. guys.
Should we get breakfast?

181
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.987
Jesus. This is older
than my grandma

182
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.489
and your grandma too.

183
00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.366
I don't know why
people still use these.

184
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.493
Why not?

185
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.787
It's so outdated and bulky.

186
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.413
and it's got limited range.

187
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.332
and it's not even accurate.

188
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.918
Listen. it's all about 5G now.

189
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.420
-6G will be next.
-If your brain isn't fried

190
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.297
-with all that radiation.
-Uh-hmm. Really?

191
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.007
-Uh-hmm.
-All right.

192
00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.092
Put your phone away.
Let's see how long you last.

193
00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.760
Whatever.

194
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.013
All right.

195
00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.224
I'm gonna go eat some pancakes.

196
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.226
You can come if you like.

197
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.747
By the way. um.
did you guys

198
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.165
blow an air horn this morning?

199
00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.752
What are you giggling about?

200
00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:12.422
They're being immature.
Mrs. Wells.

201
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.090
You winding him up again.

202
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.925
It's jealousy. Mrs. Wells.

203
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.635
You know what? I just think

204
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.053
they just can't handle the fact

205
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.805
that I'm
the superior astronomer.

206
00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.557
-You are so modest.
-I know.

207
00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.767
So how's the research
coming along then. Ogilvy?

208
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.769
Not bad. In fact. very soon.

209
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.646
you should see our names
in the news

210
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.940
for some very important
astronomical event.

211
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.693
Hmm. that reminds me

212
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.571
of something that I heard
in the radio this morning.

213
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.281
What did you hear on the radio?

214
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.992
Something about a meteor
landing at Horsell Common.

215
00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.660
What? When?

216
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.787
This morning.

217
00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.959
What the hell?

218
00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.504
We're already too late.
What's the point?

219
00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.340
Just ride!

220
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.050
The only thing
that matters is that

221
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.218
we're the first people
to investigate the impact.

222
00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.054
Let's just hope
it's not what we think it is.

223
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.555
What you think it is.

224
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.806
I doubt it's ground zero

225
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.308
of an alien invasion. Herbert.

226
00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.476
We'll see.

227
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.685
All right.

228
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.031
Come on. hurry up.

229
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.166
So. we're a little bit late
to be the first ones here.

230
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.918
Let's get some fun.

231
00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.878
So much for being
the early bird. guys.

232
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.922
Excuse me.

233
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.343
Whoa.

234
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.431
So...

235
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.395
meteorite?

236
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.813
It's big. isn't it?

237
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:52.939
It's got to be
at least...

238
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.732
50. 60 feet wide.

239
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.823
We should get close to that.

240
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.783
Yeah.
I don't know if you notice.

241
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.243
but there's police everywhere.

242
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.452
We'll go on the back.

243
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.997
Follow me.

244
00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.895
All right. guys.

245
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.064
I need this whole area.
get them out.

246
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.483
Nobody. and I mean.
nobody can come down there.

247
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.193
-Is that understood?
-Yes. sergeant.

248
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:40.903
Okay. Thank you very much.

249
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:43.197
Get down.

250
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.991
Sergeant. Sergeant

251
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.327
Okay. Thank you.

252
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.065
Looks clear.

253
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.819
Whoa.

254
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.037
What is this?

255
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.583
It's like a heat
coming off in it.

256
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.884
Shh.

257
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.511
It's cooler down here
near the impact.

258
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.473
Ogi. have you got that torch?

259
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:53.392
-Yeah. yeah.
-Okay.

260
00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.686
Well. it's definitely
not a meteorite.

261
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.939
-How do you know that?
-Look at the shape of it.

262
00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.482
It's all wrong. I mean.

263
00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.275
it looks like it's metal.

264
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.845
Holy.

265
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.096
What is that?

266
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.476
Oh. my God.

267
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.357
We should go.

268
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.234
For once.
I agree with you. Hannah.

269
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.163
Herb!

270
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.294
Herbert! Herb!

271
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.463
-Herbert. let's go.
-Yeah. sorry.

272
00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.299
What are you doing down there?

273
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.593
Get up here right now!

274
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.012
Quick!

275
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.306
You guys better have
a bloody good reason

276
00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.975
as to why I shouldn't have
you guys arrested right now.

277
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.977
What are you doing here?

278
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.854
We're from UCL.

279
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.481
Dr. Stint sent us to start
investigating the meteorite.

280
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.317
This is a restricted area.

281
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.485
Dr. Stint will be coming
herself to investigate.

282
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.238
There's no way
she'll send a bunch of kids.

283
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.699
Follow me. now.

284
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:32.825
Kids?

285
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.913
You all right. Herb?

286
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.372
Yeah. I'm okay.

287
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.499
Just thinking about what it was.

288
00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.294
I'm just wondering if we should
tell him what we saw.

289
00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.004
Tell me--tell me what?

290
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.172
What did you see?

291
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:49.717
Well?

292
00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.888
It was like an octopus
shrouded in black smoke.

293
00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.266
An octopus?

294
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.935
Yeah.

295
00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:00.061
Stay there.

296
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.979
Don't move.

297
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.943
Well. congratulations. Herb.

298
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.361
You were right.

299
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.572
It feels great. Ogi.
really does.

300
00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.366
So. why do we think
that they're here?

301
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.909
How would I know?

302
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.160
To have tea
with his mom or something.

303
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.162
Okay.

304
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.039
I'm gonna start moving
the civilians shortly

305
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.666
and Dr. Stint will be arriving.

306
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.501
I guess you guys
should speak to her.

307
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.127
Do you think that this is--

308
00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.837
that this is dangerous
for everyone?

309
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.673
I'm not qualified to say.

310
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.883
but she is.

311
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.219
-Dr. Stint!
-Why am I not surprised

312
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.762
to see you three here?

313
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.764
-You know these guys?
-Indeed I do.

314
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.433
-Yeah. they belong to me.
-Well. they have illegally

315
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.727
entered a police cordon

316
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.562
and you're all old enough
to be arrested.

317
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.273
Okay.

318
00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.899
Well. what did you see?

319
00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.485
It was some kind of... creature.

320
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.862
Dr. Stint. I got close to it.

321
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:52.905
And it...

322
00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:56.742
I'm just not sure
if it was friendly.

323
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.327
that's what I'm saying.

324
00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.787
Damn it.

325
00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.289
Look.
there's too many people around.

326
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.790
We were the first in the scene.

327
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.375
I've got two
or three more officers.

328
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.002
The MOD. they won't be here
for another hour

329
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.336
-or so. so...
-Yeah. we don't

330
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.754
have time to wait.

331
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.839
I need
to start investigating now.

332
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.009
Dr. Stint.

333
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.095
Be careful.

334
00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.847
Don't worry. Herbert.
I know what I'm doing.

335
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.323
That's strange.

336
00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:36.782
What the hell happened
over there?

337
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.992
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

338
00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:41.162
But what is going on over there?

339
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.331
Dr. Stint!
Have you got a moment to talk?

340
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.291
I'm sorry. I don't.
Not right now. okay?

341
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.879
If that goes out live. hundreds.

342
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.798
maybe thousands of people
will descend onto this crater.

343
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.800
We have no idea what
the Martians are gonna do.

344
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.103
Move them back.

345
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:48.813
Move them back. get them back.
Come on. move back!

346
00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.942
Run!

347
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.693
Move. let's go! Move!

348
00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:42.741
Hannah. any ideas?

349
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.327
Head for the bikes!

350
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.088
Come on. Hannah!

351
00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:08.017
How many people
do you think it killed?

352
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.435
I don't know.

353
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.084
It's another landing.

354
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.839
What should we do?

355
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.925
Let's go back to my mom's.
Let's go.

356
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.801
This way.

357
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.183
Mom? Mom?

358
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.447
She's already gone
to Leatherhead.

359
00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:05.533
Sorry. Herb.

360
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.117
Do you think
we'll get through this?

361
00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:14.917
They're on their way
to the second landing.

362
00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.919
Yeah.
I think that's right.

363
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.796
You know. let.
let's hope the military

364
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:20.965
-can sort out the situation.
-We'll see about that.

365
00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:23.842
Why can't you be positive. man?

366
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.728
...pebbles into space to wake

367
00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:36.605
what you can't possibly
understand.

368
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:39.358
and now they've thrown
rocks back.

369
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.110
And all you see
is the betterment

370
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.570
of your prideful goals.

371
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.405
reporting it on the television.

372
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.782
My son paid for your sin.

373
00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.576
I paid for you sin!

374
00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.661
Sorry about that.

375
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:53.080
Clearly. tensions
are running high here.

376
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.374
Let me just see
if I can speak to--

377
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.334
oh. Dr. Stint.

378
00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:59.503
-Just one moment. Doctor.
-One minute.

379
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.213
Could you explain
to our viewers what you think

380
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.840
the intentions
of the Martians might be?

381
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.258
It's too early to say.

382
00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:05.926
We don't know what they want.

383
00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.720
we don't know
what they're capable of.

384
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.722
We attempted
to have a dialogue.

385
00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:11.515
but they don't seem
in the mood for that. so--

386
00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:13.100
Any thoughts
on the second landing?

387
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.560
We're investigating that.

388
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.520
There's no activity so far.

389
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.814
Any safety advice you'd like
to give to our audience?

390
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.733
Stay at home and don't panic.

391
00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.443
Leave your radios and TVs on.

392
00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:24.278
We will broadcast updates.

393
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:26.280
If you are near
any of the landing sites.

394
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.324
do not approach them
and keep clear.

395
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:31.035
Please. leave this to us
and let us do our jobs.

396
00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:33.245
That's all I have to say.
Thank you.

397
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.622
Dr. Stint. please.
just one more question.

398
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.124
Wait. no. no!

399
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.543
No!

400
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:42.630
Damn!

401
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.923
-All the channels are dead!
-Right.

402
00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:47.509
I'll ring my mom to find out
what's going on in Leatherhead.

403
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.018
Signal's dead.

404
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:57.561
Try mine.

405
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.687
Thanks.

406
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.025
-No. No signal in yours. Hannah.
-Really?

407
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:05.444
Mine is dead. too.

408
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.237
Wait a minute.

409
00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:09.198
Do you think the satellites
have been compromised?

410
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.160
Damn.

411
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.579
My parents are in Manchester.

412
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:17.539
Do you think this has hit them?

413
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:19.041
No.

414
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.877
They'll be moving too slowly.

415
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.545
Why'd you say that?

416
00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:25.297
Because if
we're dealing with Mars.

417
00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.174
which I think we are.
then Earth's gravity

418
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.592
is three times
stronger than Mars.

419
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.844
so. you know. theoretically.

420
00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:32.596
they're gonna be down
here moving three times slower.

421
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.265
Thank God. finally!
Something positive!

422
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.769
My parents are probably okay.

423
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:40.729
They're in Mallorca.
getting drunk.

424
00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.564
spending my inheritance.

425
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:45.234
So what do we do?
Do we stay here or leave?

426
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.152
What do you reckon?

427
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.696
I think for now.
we do what the lieutenant

428
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.072
on the television said.

429
00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:51.615
Stay put till we know more.

430
00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:53.659
Well. without
any communications.

431
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:55.202
how are we gonna know that?

432
00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:58.455
I don't know.

433
00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:02.084
You know--you know what. guys?

434
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:03.669
We'll probably be fine.
You know.

435
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:05.295
our military has
state-of-the-art technology.

436
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:06.755
State-of-the-art
for this planet.

437
00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.257
I mean. we're dealing
with a world

438
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:09.675
that's millions of years
older than us.

439
00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:10.884
So what do we do?
Do we stay

440
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.177
at home or do we hit the road?

441
00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.721
Stay here.

442
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:15.305
We don't know
how many are out there.

443
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:17.266
We don't even
know where we're going.

444
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:22.479
Okay.

445
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.358
We may be in conflict.

446
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.527
but we're British. Hannah!

447
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.195
Let's lick some cups of tea!

448
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.990
Whoa!

449
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.492
-Whoa!
-Oh!

450
00:26:16.492 --> 00:26:18.494
There's something in the garden!

451
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.436
Hey. who is it?

452
00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:49.024
Say something! Show yourself!

453
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.071
Easy!

454
00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:55.739
I'm Baxter.

455
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.866
Ben Baxter. Uh. an artilleryman.

456
00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.536
What are you doing out here?

457
00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:03.080
I'm just looking
for a place to hide.

458
00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:07.543
Please? I just need to rest.

459
00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:11.797
Come inside.

460
00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.841
Please.
I'll meet you at the back door.

461
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:21.056
-Are you nuts?
-It's a human. Oggy.

462
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:23.809
Yeah?

463
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:26.186
Besides. he's a soldier.
He might have information.

464
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:34.987
Thank you.

465
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:36.321
Of course.

466
00:27:55.382 --> 00:27:56.592
Is everything all right?

467
00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:00.637
They wiped us out.

468
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.933
They just completely
wiped us out.

469
00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:10.147
Would you like a water
or a tea or something?

470
00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:11.732
Oh. come. come on. man.
He's a soldier.

471
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:14.109
Give him whiskey or something.

472
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.777
Yeah. Of course.

473
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:19.990
All my friends.

474
00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.160
they just...

475
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.552
I don't suppose
I could trouble you

476
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.929
for another one. could I. chap?

477
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.597
Yeah. of course. Yeah.

478
00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:48.352
I'm. um. Herb. by the way.

479
00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:50.979
This is Oggy and Hannah.

480
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:06.536
Do you wanna freshen up?

481
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.748
Thank you.

482
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.708
Yeah. The bathroom's--

483
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:12.793
it's up the stairs.

484
00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.044
You're welcome to.

485
00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:54.042
So how did you get here?

486
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:59.798
I got saved by blind luck.

487
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:02.175
I lost my balance
and fell into a ditch

488
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:03.885
the moment that heat ray struck.

489
00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:07.931
Wiped out my entire unit.

490
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.933
I was the only one to survive.

491
00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:13.020
It wiped out the town
like it was nothing.

492
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:16.565
And I was just frozen in fear.

493
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:18.233
Do you have any idea
what they might want

494
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:20.485
or where they might be headed?

495
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.905
I'm not sure exactly.
But they're not far from here.

496
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:25.574
Do we stay here
and hope the military

497
00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:27.159
have got it under control.

498
00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:29.870
or do we get as far away
from here as we can?

499
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.913
I think we should definitely
hit the road.

500
00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:35.792
There's no way the military's
gonna get these under control.

501
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.502
We're like ants.

502
00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.337
Where do you think we should go?

503
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.256
As far away from here
as possible.

504
00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:44.634
I have to go to Leatherhead.
My mom's there.

505
00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:46.178
-Then we'll come with you.
-Yeah. man.

506
00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.763
No. no. You don't have to.

507
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:51.391
No. listen. anything we do.
we do as a team.

508
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.644
Thanks.

509
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:56.605
Is it safe for us to go there?

510
00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:58.732
I can't say exactly.

511
00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:00.484
I lost my comms in that ditch

512
00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:02.527
and I've got no way
to communicate with command.

513
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:06.865
Would a walkie-talkie do?

514
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:09.034
Yes. Without the satellite.
that's the only way

515
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:11.286
we could contact
any other military units.

516
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.633
All right.

517
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:26.968
The first cylinder
had landed here.

518
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.429
and the second one was here.

519
00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:31.556
Now. you guys said you needed
to get to Leatherhead. right?

520
00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.226
-Yes!
-That's there.

521
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.853
Let me see if we can find out
what the situation is.

522
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:40.148
This is 19473F.
is anybody there? Over.

523
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:47.114
This is 19473F.
is anybody listening? Over.

524
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:49.950
19473F. is anybody there?

525
00:31:56.081 --> 00:32:01.044
This is 19473F.
is anybody there? Over!

526
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:04.589
This is 18385D.
What are you looking for? Over.

527
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.425
This is Ben Baxter.
artilleryman. Unit F.

528
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.844
looking for a status update.

529
00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:11.304
Please identify yourself. Over.

530
00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.974
This is Corporal Fred.
Unit D command post.

531
00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:15.392
Good to hear from you.

532
00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:17.144
We thought Unit F had all gone.

533
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:19.646
Any other survivors? Over.

534
00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:24.151
It's just me.

535
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.278
I'm in a bit
of a hot zone here. Fred.

536
00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:28.655
-Uh. I'm in a residence. uh...
-Maybury Hill.

537
00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:30.490
...uh. Maybury Hill.

538
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.784
We're about three clicks out
the first landing site.

539
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:35.829
Uh. I'm with three civilians.
Over.

540
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.122
Okay. Ben.

541
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.456
We need you guys to move ASAP.

542
00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:41.084
get to a safe zone. Over.

543
00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:42.878
These guys need to get
to Leatherhead. Fred.

544
00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:45.046
Do you know
if the route's clear? Over.

545
00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:47.132
Leatherhead? Over.

546
00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:49.092
Yes. Leatherhead. Over.

547
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:51.011
Negative.

548
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:53.138
The third cylinder
landed at Pyford.

549
00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:55.182
and Tripods are crawling
all over there.

550
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:57.058
Over.

551
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.686
All right.
Let me get back to you. Over.

552
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.898
Okay. One last thing.
Do not use petrol vehicles.

553
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.858
The Martians can lock
onto the exhaust trails.

554
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:07.485
Please use
alternative transport. Over.

555
00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.696
Copy that. Fred. Over and out.

556
00:33:09.696 --> 00:33:11.990
Godspeed. Over and out.

557
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:16.077
What do you guys think?

558
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:19.539
We go north to Weybridge.
down to Leatherhead.

559
00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.291
Right.

560
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.210
I'll take you guys
as far as Weybridge.

561
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.170
I can join
the other troops there.

562
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.755
Right. Let's do this.

563
00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:28.673
We need to pack as much food
as possible.

564
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.592
We've got no idea how long
this thing is gonna last for.

565
00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:35.764
Well. you heard what Fred said.

566
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:36.890
It sounds like we're walking.

567
00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:39.643
We've got bikes.

568
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.357
It's probably not the best time
to say this. considering. uh.

569
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:47.108
but you look ridiculous
on that bike.

570
00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:49.027
-I look ridiculous. Oggy?
-Yeah.

571
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:50.195
Martians landing
and taking over the world.

572
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:52.364
and I look ridiculous?

573
00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:53.990
Huh. I think we're going
right soon. right?

574
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.492
Yeah. it's definitely
next right.

575
00:33:55.492 --> 00:33:57.494
-Not yet.
-Hannah. it's the next right.

576
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:59.246
We'll turn right
when I tell you to turn right.

577
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.331
Listen. I'm telling you
it's the next right!

578
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.540
Oggy!

579
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:07.420
Fighters.

580
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.381
Let me check in with Fred.
Hannah. give me the walkie.

581
00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:14.344
This is 19473F.

582
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:15.929
This is Ben Baxter
looking for Fred.

583
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.973
Are you listening. mate? Over.

584
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:21.226
This is Corporal Fred.
Where are you guys? Over.

585
00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:22.727
Fred. we're in Woking.

586
00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.312
There's not much
of the town left here

587
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.897
and we've just seen fighters
heading east.

588
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.565
Is everything all right
over there? Over.

589
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.609
Negative.
Stay to the west. Over.

590
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:32.404
Roger that. Fred. Over and out.

591
00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:34.114
Let's keep moving.

592
00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:44.457
Oh. my God.

593
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.645
We're too close here.

594
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:07.272
We got to keep moving.

595
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:08.315
This way.

596
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.781
There you go.

597
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.576
Welcome to Weybridge.

598
00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:21.703
Let me ask these boys
what the situation is.

599
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.330
That sounds good.

600
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:29.919
Lieutenant.

601
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:31.338
Hi. Can I help?

602
00:35:31.338 --> 00:35:32.380
Ben Baxter.

603
00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:36.301
I'm all that's left of Unit F.

604
00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:38.511
I'm trying to get these guys
as far south as possible.

605
00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:40.347
Where are you going now?

606
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:42.515
We're going to Leatherhead.
We're looking for my mom.

607
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:45.018
I wouldn't suggest that at all.
It's very dangerous.

608
00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:47.437
A third cylinder just landed
very close to Leatherhead.

609
00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:49.356
the Air Force
is on their way there now.

610
00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:50.857
Well. what about the people
who've already been evacuated?

611
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.817
We're moving everyone
towards London.

612
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.736
So. I suggest your family
is on their way there now.

613
00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:57.113
-How is London?
-Clear so far.

614
00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.990
The underground
and the old bunkers

615
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.785
offer more protection against
any attacks in the center.

616
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.037
But right now. it's just
the town South of London.

617
00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.330
What about Manchester?

618
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.790
No reports coming out yet.

619
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.752
What about Mallorca?

620
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:13.338
No reports of anything
coming out of Europe yet.

621
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:15.131
If you go across that bridge.
you'll find Officer Marvin.

622
00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:18.343
He'll take your names
and arrange a boat for you.

623
00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:20.512
-Thanks. Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

624
00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:37.904
That's it. That's the base.

625
00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:41.324
Let's ditch the bikes here.

626
00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:45.286
Ah. I'll miss you. old girl.

627
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.707
Seriously?

628
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.501
Yeah.

629
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:53.002
If we get through this.
I'm coming back for my bike.

630
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:55.672
Come on. let's go.

631
00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:02.262
Well...

632
00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:04.264
at least we've got
the whole army with us.

633
00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:06.015
It's not gonna do
any good.

634
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:08.476
Why? Is there really nothing
we can do?

635
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:11.521
Against their shields. we might
as well be using bad language.

636
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:13.898
-There's the queue.
-That's the one.

637
00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.859
Well. at least it's not as long
as we thought it might be.

638
00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:17.986
Or because everyone else
left town already.

639
00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:20.363
I'm gonna go check in
with the unit
and get some information.

640
00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:22.365
Catch you guys up.
You check in
with Officer Marvin.

641
00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:23.700
All right.

642
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:33.460
Stop it! Stop it now!

643
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.004
I said stop! All right?

644
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.714
You two need to talk
your shits out.

645
00:37:37.714 --> 00:37:39.591
or there's neither of you
getting on the boat.

646
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:42.802
Now. get back in line quietly.
and let us do our jobs.

647
00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:46.765
Corporal Fred. this is
a command post. please respond.

648
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:48.224
Over.

649
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:49.809
Yes. Captain.
This is Fred. Over.

650
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:51.895
We are mobilizing
all units.

651
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:54.939
Threat intel coming in.
How many civilians are with you?

652
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:57.275
We currently have
approximately
20 civilians here.

653
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.360
Over.

654
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.070
Are there any more after that?

655
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.614
Looks like
it's the last of them.

656
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:04.199
We can't say for sure. Over.

657
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:06.534
Make sure you are ready.
As I say--

658
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.786
-And you. sir?
-Scott Jones.

659
00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:11.456
-And you. sir?
-Mark David.

660
00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:13.708
-And you. lady?
-Anne Fulbert.

661
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.543
-And you. sir?
-Herbert Wells.

662
00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:18.671
Herbert Wells. And you two?
Uh. Hannah Jones.

663
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:20.882
-Ogilvy Montague.
-Montague?

664
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:22.675
Yeah.

665
00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:24.135
Captain Marvin. stand down.
These three are with me.

666
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.136
Just carry on
down the line. please.

667
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.305
Excellent. Thank you.

668
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.433
Listen. I managed to get us
our own boat.

669
00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:33.019
-Which one?
-It's that one right there.

670
00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:34.229
It's nice.

671
00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:35.813
How'd you manage that?

672
00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.524
Benefits of knowing somebody
in the unit.

673
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:39.317
Thank you. Ben. really.
for everything.

674
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:42.612
Listen. it's me that has
to thank you. All of you guys.

675
00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:44.197
You really helped me out.

676
00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:45.532
Now. listen.
get yourselves on the boat.

677
00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:46.741
I'll get some supplies.

678
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.326
and I'll catch you in a bit.

679
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:57.544
-Montague?
-My first name is Ogilvy.

680
00:38:57.544 --> 00:38:59.837
Really having issue
with Montague?

681
00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.631
Your parents
didn't like you much. did they?

682
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:02.966
Oh.

683
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.845
This has to be them.

684
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.764
Excuse me. Does one of you
happen to be Daniel?

685
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.808
-Yeah. It's me. You're Herbert?
-Yeah.

686
00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:13.393
-This is your boat here. okay?
-Thank you.

687
00:39:13.393 --> 00:39:14.435
Listen. you got to row it
yourself. okay?

688
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:15.478
Okay.

689
00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:18.189
All right. Great.

690
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:21.025
Oh. oh. looks like we're rowing.

691
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:24.237
Yes. it does.

692
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:27.824
-Are we all set?
-Gotta wait for Ben.

693
00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:31.369
-How wrong was I?
-About what?

694
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:36.165
Walkie-talkies. maps. compasses.
all low-tech technology.

695
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.376
You're right.

696
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.879
-I will be. yeah.
-Okay.

697
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:45.425
Aww. what a nice candid moment.

698
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:47.302
-Shut up. Oggy.
-Gotta get it on camera.

699
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:49.304
Uh. give me
my camera back. Oggs.

700
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:50.597
What? At least it is waterproof.

701
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.056
But it's not Ogilvy-proof.

702
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.099
-Your mom's not Ogilvy-proof.
-Huh.

703
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:54.434
Ugh.

704
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.235
Whoa.

705
00:40:54.744 --> 00:40:56.913
Go on! There's more. run!

706
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.251
Come on!

707
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:03.628
-Help.
-Hannah. come on. Hurry up.

708
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:08.591
Come on. move.

709
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:30.196
We need to get
out of here.

710
00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:31.823
Yeah. One of us
is unconscious at the moment.

711
00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.534
Yeah. we're gonna have
to carry her. Carry her?

712
00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:35.952
-She's. she's awake.
-She's waking up.

713
00:41:35.952 --> 00:41:39.956
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

714
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:41.791
What happened?

715
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:43.167
You kind of fell over
and hit your head.

716
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.752
so we brought you through here.

717
00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:46.129
Look. they took out
the whole military.

718
00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:47.755
We have to go. now.

719
00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:50.925
-Yeah. Give me a hand.
-Yeah?

720
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:53.386
Oh. okay.
All right. Wait. wait. wait.

721
00:41:53.386 --> 00:41:54.804
You good?

722
00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:58.349
-Okay.
-Three. two. one.

723
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.809
I need my bag.

724
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.938
Okay. Let's go. guys.
See if we can find the boat.

725
00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:05.314
Thanks.

726
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:37.138
Guys. look.

727
00:42:37.138 --> 00:42:39.766
We can take this boat
and try and make it to London.

728
00:42:39.766 --> 00:42:41.517
Sound like a plan?

729
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:42.977
Fine by me.

730
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.063
We should give it a push.
I guess.

731
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.634
God. look at this place.

732
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:22.767
-I hope Ben made it out okay.
-Yeah.

733
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.405
Look. we need to find shelter.

734
00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.573
Otherwise.
we're gonna to turn ice

735
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:39.200
by the time we reach London.

736
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.660
Okay. Let's just find
somewhere to hold up.

737
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:15.152
Nope. It's dead.

738
00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:19.991
Do you think
it'll ever work again?

739
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:22.243
Always has before. maybe.

740
00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:23.953
I don't think so.

741
00:44:23.953 --> 00:44:25.621
Never the optimist.

742
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:28.249
Guys...

743
00:44:30.543 --> 00:44:31.961
who is that?

744
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:35.756
Hello?

745
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.093
Are you okay?

746
00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:52.148
It's okay.

747
00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.651
Do you sin. boy?

748
00:44:58.154 --> 00:45:01.908
Are you clear of conscience
and pure of heart?

749
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:07.580
Padre. this boy
is as pure as they come.

750
00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.373
He hasn't sin a day in his life.

751
00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:12.001
He won't even Google
the answers to the crossword.

752
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.836
Yeah.

753
00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:15.171
We're all gonna die.

754
00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:19.508
This is the end of humanity.
the human race.

755
00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:22.470
We have abandoned God.
and now he is punishing us.

756
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.513
Sorry. who. who are you?

757
00:45:24.513 --> 00:45:27.725
Why. why are you sat
on that log?

758
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:31.771
I'm one of God's
loyal messengers.

759
00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:33.439
Are you--are you local--
are you a local priest?

760
00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:35.566
Do you--
do you know the area well?

761
00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.151
Do you know where we are?

762
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.404
Look. we've just been
by the river.

763
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:41.864
We're just. just looking
for somewhere to get...

764
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.032
We're all gonna die.

765
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:48.120
You really should keep
some hope. father.

766
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.207
It's the beginning of the end.

767
00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:53.084
How can we escape?

768
00:45:54.627 --> 00:45:56.212
They can't be destroyed.

769
00:45:56.212 --> 00:45:57.463
We saw them get destroyed
this afternoon.

770
00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.006
That doesn't matter.

771
00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:06.180
We humans deserve this.

772
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.183
For too long. we've ravaged
and raped the planet.

773
00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:12.311
and succumbed
to impulsive desires.

774
00:46:15.314 --> 00:46:18.609
You've brought this all
on yourselves with you.

775
00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.987
your youthful folly.

776
00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:24.740
I tried. Lord.

777
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.450
Do you know what?

778
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.328
Over there is an actual
invading Martian army.

779
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:32.373
And over there.
our army is amassing as well.

780
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:34.417
So you can stand around here
if you like

781
00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:35.960
bemoaning the human race

782
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.503
and guess what?
You'll meet both of them.

783
00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.714
And you'll probably be turned
into ash.

784
00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:41.716
Or you can just be decent
and just help us.

785
00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:44.343
Tell us where to go.

786
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:47.304
Please.

787
00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:51.851
Okay.

788
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:55.813
It's--it is possible...

789
00:46:58.024 --> 00:47:01.819
in that direction.
you may find some houses

790
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:05.364
and maybe some food. too.

791
00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:10.327
-Thank you.
-Hey. uh. let's make a move.

792
00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.497
This guy is nuttier
than squirrel shit.

793
00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.583
What gives you that idea?

794
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:17.710
I'm quite sane. Thank you.

795
00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:21.922
I'm the only one
who understands.

796
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.091
Come on. guys.

797
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.676
You kids had best repent

798
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.303
before it's too late.

799
00:47:27.303 --> 00:47:29.305
Whatever you say. Padre.

800
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:33.225
I can save you.

801
00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:34.977
I can save all of you.

802
00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:45.446
We're here.

803
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.554
It looks like the owner
didn't have time

804
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.056
to take their luggage.

805
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:24.443
Thank you. Lord.

806
00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.697
Can you not see these are mine?

807
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:31.575
Take yours from the bag.

808
00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.494
What?

809
00:48:33.494 --> 00:48:35.079
What does it matter if I take
my food from there or there?

810
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:38.707
I took these.
therefore they belong to me.

811
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:41.502
If you want your share.
take it from there.

812
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:43.254
not from my share.

813
00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:45.881
What happened to share
and share alike. Padre?

814
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:48.300
Isn't that in the bible?

815
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.264
You paraphrase the bible.
you blasphemer.

816
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:57.518
Do not disrespect
and dishonor a sacred text.

817
00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:59.186
Sacred text?

818
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.896
It's a bunch of gibberish.

819
00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:02.314
-Oggy.
-What?

820
00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:04.024
-Slow down.
-No.

821
00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:05.818
This guy is an asshole!

822
00:49:05.818 --> 00:49:07.319
Oggy. just leave it.

823
00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.654
What kind of priest
is this anyway?

824
00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:10.114
He's clearly crazy.

825
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:11.574
What do you wish of me. Father?

826
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:16.078
Father. what do you wish?

827
00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:21.250
Listen you little prick.

828
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.961
you better stay away
from my food.

829
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.921
God does not want me
to help you.

830
00:49:25.921 --> 00:49:28.048
You're all sinners. All of you.

831
00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:31.802
You. and you. and you.

832
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.358
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

833
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:48.611
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

834
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:50.404
Please. please don't kill me.
Calm down.

835
00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:52.281
Calm down.

836
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:54.491
-Please don't kill me.
-What do you wish of me. Father?

837
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:58.412
Put it down. Padre.

838
00:49:58.412 --> 00:49:59.830
Please.

839
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.332
Please put it down.
Don't kill me.

840
00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:02.750
Please don't kill me.

841
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.544
Please. Please.

842
00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:24.396
Okay. Okay.

843
00:50:25.898 --> 00:50:28.192
Okay.

844
00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:32.238
Listen. pal.
we can get out of your way.

845
00:50:32.238 --> 00:50:33.989
you can have this place
to yourself. yeah?

846
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:36.283
No.

847
00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:38.702
You stay.

848
00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:44.041
He hasn't decided on
your destiny yet.

849
00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:48.170
I will tell you
if and when you may go.

850
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.880
Now. sit!

851
00:51:54.987 --> 00:51:56.947
You must eat. woman.

852
00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.826
You are the weaker sex.

853
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:02.453
Keep your strength up.

854
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:07.750
Thank you.

855
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.836
You see. gentlemen.
a little respect.

856
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.964
this woman puts you to shame.

857
00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.716
Yeah. We're sorry.

858
00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:24.308
There may come a time soon

859
00:52:24.308 --> 00:52:28.103
when the repopulation
of the planet must begin.

860
00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:30.731
Only the great
may give you their seed.

861
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:35.235
As God's messenger.
I shall be one.

862
00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.283
These troglodytes.

863
00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:46.622
they may not infect you
with their inferior seed.

864
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:22.199
What happened to you?

865
00:53:24.576 --> 00:53:27.162
What made you turn your back
on everything you stand for?

866
00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.791
I haven't turned my back. boy.

867
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:33.627
No.

868
00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:38.424
I've never been
clearer of my purpose.

869
00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:46.348
For too long.
I found myself questioning Him.

870
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:52.521
I would question the disasters
of the world and hear nothing.

871
00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:57.109
Then He took my wife.

872
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:00.237
Cancer.

873
00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.741
I questioned Him
night and day after that.

874
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:08.120
"Why. God. why?"

875
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.873
I'd served Him so faithfully.
one moment of doubt

876
00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:11.999
and He took her from me.

877
00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.253
Then I hated Him.

878
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.464
I questioned His reason again.

879
00:54:21.717 --> 00:54:24.094
And He took my daughter.

880
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:30.017
Then these things came
from the sky and He.

881
00:54:33.437 --> 00:54:34.980
He took my son.

882
00:54:38.484 --> 00:54:43.697
But then. I finally heard Him.

883
00:54:45.157 --> 00:54:47.659
I heard His voice.

884
00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:49.495
Now I understand.

885
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:52.915
I understand my sacrifice.

886
00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:57.169
What it took for me to hold
court with our great Lord.

887
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:59.838
It took everything.

888
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:05.552
I'm so sorry.

889
00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:10.766
Don't be sorry. woman.

890
00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.062
What I have lost
in mortal distraction.

891
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:17.523
I have gained
in eternal greatness.

892
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:26.406
And I will be reunited
with my loved ones eventually.

893
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:36.375
Now...

894
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:41.213
I mean. to take a nap.

895
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:48.845
And I want no one to disturb me
or come close.

896
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.891
If you do.

897
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:57.771
I will carve the name of God
into your flesh.

898
00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:23.774
Get down.

899
00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:49.007
It's gone.

900
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:54.262
Sinful fiend.

901
00:57:56.056 --> 00:57:58.558
I warned you what would happen.

902
00:57:58.558 --> 00:58:02.187
-Just--please. just--
-Oh. Lord. give me guidance.

903
00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:03.814
How do I help these sinners?

904
00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:05.190
-Father. you need to--
-Do not silence me!

905
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:06.650
-Okay. Okay.
-Shh!

906
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:13.365
Father.
come away from the window.

907
00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:19.496
He has spoken.

908
00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:26.878
We should all be grateful.

909
00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:28.922
The Lord has been merciful
to you.

910
00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:34.553
He has granted
you two safe passage.

911
00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:37.431
Safe passage to the next world.

912
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:41.226
And a quick death in this one.

913
00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:44.563
You must live for now.

914
00:58:44.563 --> 00:58:46.940
to fulfill his will.

915
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.483
You need to...

916
00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:58.076
Go!

917
00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:59.578
Go!

918
00:58:59.578 --> 00:59:01.204
Oh. God.

919
00:59:57.928 --> 01:00:01.389
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah. Ogg. and Herb.

920
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:06.102
Where are you? Please respond.
Over.

921
01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:10.190
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah. Ogg. and Herb.

922
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.945
Can you hear me?
Please respond. Over.

923
01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:19.449
This is Corporal Ben Baxter
to Hannah. Ogg. and Herb.

924
01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.327
Can you hear me?
Please respond. Over.

925
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.204
Ben. it's Hannah.

926
01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.956
We're here. Are you okay? Over.

927
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.667
Hi. Hannah. I'm here.
I'm okay.

928
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.544
Are you guys all good? Over.

929
01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.922
Yeah. we're just holed up by--
in a house by Richmond.

930
01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.257
Where are you? Over.

931
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.759
I'm at Putney Hill. Over.

932
01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.135
Whereabouts?

933
01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.806
Uh. near the forest. Over.

934
01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.016
Okay. We'll come find you.
Stay put.

935
01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.227
Excellent.
See you guys soon.

936
01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.645
Over and out.

937
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.625
What is this red
weed thing everywhere?

938
01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.128
Maybe they're
terraforming the planet.

939
01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.754
That's plausible.

940
01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.299
Whatever it is.
it's giving me the creeps.

941
01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:18.800
Yeah.

942
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.051
Me. too.

943
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.533
Does anyone know where we are?

944
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.619
-We're here.
-Okay.

945
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:48.663
And the woods are.
like. near there.

946
01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.206
So that way?

947
01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.625
There's only one way
to find out. right?

948
01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:52.709
Yeah.

949
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.894
Look. What's that?

950
01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.107
I don't know.

951
01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.609
Could be a signal?

952
01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:19.945
Only one way to find out.

953
01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.496
Guys. let's hope
this ain't another crazy priest.

954
01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.414
Oh. it's Ben!

955
01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.625
Hi. guys.

956
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.669
Good to see you.
We can't stay here.

957
01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.003
We gotta keep moving.

958
01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.797
Take this. Follow me.

959
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.429
Welcome to Camp Baxter.

960
01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.767
-Oh. dang.
-What is all this?

961
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.728
These are the supplies
I was telling you about.

962
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.147
Oh. yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

963
01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.358
So what? How do you use this?
Are you gonna teach us?

964
01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.652
Put that down.

965
01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.279
You point it at the bad guy
and you pull the trigger.

966
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.657
-Now. don't touch it again.
-Yes. sir.

967
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:07.993
For Christ's sake.
don't call me sir.

968
01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:10.203
Look. if you want
something to play with.

969
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.997
this is a solar powered radio.

970
01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:13.164
We're actually
in a pretty good spot here.

971
01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.624
You might be able to pick up

972
01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.167
some of the pirate radio
frequencies.

973
01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.168
Bit old school for you.
isn't it. Oggy?

974
01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.253
Shut up. Herbert.

975
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.510
Do you think
it's safe here. Ben?

976
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.178
With the fire on
and everything.

977
01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.514
Well. so far.
there haven't been any reports

978
01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.433
of any landings near here.

979
01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.852
So
we should be all right.

980
01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.188
You hungry?

981
01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.899
Uh...

982
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.317
I think we've
kind of filled up...

983
01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.028
Yeah. we had lima beans.
sardines.

984
01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.154
---from--yes. we had the tins.
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.

985
01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.363
-Sure.
-Uh-hmm.

986
01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.667
Are we still aiming for London?

987
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.419
I don't know.

988
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:02.505
Things have changed a bit
since the seventh landing.

989
01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:05.050
-Seventh landing?
-Yeah.

990
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.885
Primrose Hill.

991
01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.429
All of the Tripods seem
to be heading in that direction.

992
01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:10.847
What about all the people
that have been evacuated

993
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.098
to London already?

994
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.558
They shipped most people

995
01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.101
across the channel to Belgium.

996
01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.644
And our best guess
is that everybody else

997
01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:18.605
-has now gone into hiding.
-Into hiding?

998
01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.065
All we seem
to do is bloody hide.

999
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.775
When are we gonna
stand up and fight?

1000
01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.782
There's gotta be a better way
to deal with this situation.

1001
01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.366
Well. I've been thinking
about that.

1002
01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:32.952
There is one possibility.

1003
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.164
Which is?

1004
01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.333
We go underground.

1005
01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.542
We live in the sewers.

1006
01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.045
Look. I know that's not great.

1007
01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.422
but maybe if we're out of sight.
they'll leave us alone.

1008
01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.508
You want us
to live in the sewers?

1009
01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.384
BEN The point is.
Oggy. that we live.

1010
01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.178
That's absurd.

1011
01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.679
Furthermore. there's no
guarantee that we'll be safe

1012
01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:53.098
-down there anyway.
-No. there's not.

1013
01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:54.766
But what other option
have we got?

1014
01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.267
They could stomp us
into extinction like that

1015
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.477
because we are nothing to them.

1016
01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.187
Oh. you keep saying that.

1017
01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.231
But we saw one get taken
out at Weybridge. no?

1018
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.608
You wanna hear
what's going on out there?

1019
01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.568
Because I'll show you.

1020
01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.072
This is 19473F.
Is anybody there? Over.

1021
01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.784
Copy. 19473F.

1022
01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.369
What are you looking for? Over.

1023
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.329
We're trying to get to London.

1024
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.747
Can you give us a status update
of what's going on out there?

1025
01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.958
-Over.
-Pretty bad.

1026
01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:22.085
Tripods are capturing humans
and collecting them like

1027
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.878
cattle at Primrose Hill.

1028
01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.755
So. I strongly advise
you stay out the way.

1029
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.841
-Over.
-Copy that. Over.

1030
01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:32.554
Now. do you really
wanna go to London?

1031
01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:33.930
Sorry. Herb.
I think Ben's right.

1032
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.014
Cool.

1033
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.538
Stop it.

1034
01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.831
Fool. Give me that.

1035
01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.251
I don't care
if you hurt yourself.

1036
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.044
but I'm not having you blow
the rest of us out. you fool.

1037
01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:07.672
No worries.

1038
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.850
I know this is awful.

1039
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.771
But. you know. I kind of
feel safe with you. guys.

1040
01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:28.776
Especially you. Herb.

1041
01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.451
You know. you're braver
than you think you are.

1042
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.206
That's what my dad
used to say to me.

1043
01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.126
Usually when I was
getting something wrong.

1044
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:51.299
Like. it took me until
about age nine to learn

1045
01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.718
how to ride a bike.

1046
01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.136
I think every other kid
in the neighborhood

1047
01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.138
had it down by about six.

1048
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.771
I'd be practicing and failing.

1049
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.232
and he would always just say.
"Keep going. Herb."

1050
01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.818
"You're braver than
you think you are."

1051
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.373
I'm gonna keep trying.

1052
01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.459
I'm going to Primrose Hill.

1053
01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.964
-Are you nuts?
-Look.

1054
01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.715
they're gonna keep collecting us
one by one.

1055
01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.509
We can keep running
and keep hiding.

1056
01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:36.052
or we can actually join
the rest of the human race

1057
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.804
-and we can fight.
-We need to find out

1058
01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:38.930
what they're doing.
why they're collecting people.

1059
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.099
No. No way. I'm not going.

1060
01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:45.687
Why the hell not?

1061
01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.438
For Queen
and bloody country. right?

1062
01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.857
-Are you serious?
-Oggy...

1063
01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:52.026
we're going. We are.

1064
01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:55.113
So whether you come
with us or not.

1065
01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.323
it's up to you.

1066
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.993
Really? Herb. Hannah!

1067
01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.287
Ben!

1068
01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.504
-Do you guys know the way?
-No.

1069
01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:19.846
There isn't
a single person around.

1070
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:22.223
Did they manage to take
many people up to Belgium?

1071
01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.892
Trying to get
as many people east as possible.

1072
01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.644
-Whereabouts?
-Tillingham.

1073
01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:28.855
that's where they've got
the ships to Ostend.

1074
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:30.064
Do you think
there's gonna be enough ships

1075
01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:31.357
to get everyone out?

1076
01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.900
I've got no idea. mate.

1077
01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.878
Jesus Christ.

1078
01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.218
What chance do we have
against them?

1079
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.930
Can't believe it.

1080
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.557
We should carry on.

1081
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.975
Hannah's right.

1082
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.685
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

1083
01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.090
Just go around here.
Go! Go around.

1084
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.051
Stay. Stay here.

1085
01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.720
Just wait.

1086
01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:50.061
Any second.

1087
01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.618
All right. now.
Now. go! Run! Run!

1088
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.335
Come on.

1089
01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:16.212
Come on. Hannah. Come on.

1090
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.303
Jesus Christ.

1091
01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.347
Look at the size of that thing.

1092
01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.853
Why are the Tripods going
around this end?

1093
01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.276
I think we need to get closer.
take a better look.

1094
01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:42.613
Yeah. We go around west.

1095
01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.240
down past the woods.

1096
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.285
Oh. hold on a second.
Just slow down.

1097
01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.454
I'm not getting any closer
than we are right now.

1098
01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:50.872
I don't wanna turn
into a pile of ash.

1099
01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.582
Oggy. we're going
that way anyway.

1100
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.292
so you either come with us
or you just stay here.

1101
01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.085
You know what. I don't know
what's going on here.

1102
01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.920
but I'm sick and tired of you
giving me ultimatums.

1103
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.422
What happened to team spirit?

1104
01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.674
Okay. In team spirit.

1105
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.634
why don't you and Ben
stay here as a team

1106
01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.595
and me and Hannah
will go down there as a team?

1107
01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:06.929
Are you sure about that?

1108
01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.306
Yes.

1109
01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.974
Could you watch us with the gun?

1110
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.142
-Sure.
-Thanks.

1111
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.145
All right. Great idea.

1112
01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.980
I'm gonna go try and find us
a better angle.

1113
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.691
Don't know why everyone's
so heroic all of a sudden.

1114
01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.902
Don't worry. mate.

1115
01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.112
We weren't expecting
any heroics out of you anyway.

1116
01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.281
Yeah. all right.
Calm down. John Wick.

1117
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.944
Are they nesting?

1118
01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.572
Get down.

1119
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.715
Oh. my God.

1120
01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.061
It's feeding.

1121
01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:40.565
Go. Go on.

1122
01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:47.905
What do we do?

1123
01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.782
Call Ben.

1124
01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.826
Ben. Oggy. are you there?

1125
01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.163
Hi. Hannah. We're here.
Everything's fine.

1126
01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.999
Nothing so far.

1127
01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.626
You guys find anything?

1128
01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.753
I--I--I can't even begin.

1129
01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.922
But we need to leave now.

1130
01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.133
Is Oggy with you?

1131
01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.302
Oggy's with me. He's fine.
He's just keeping--

1132
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.761
Jesus. Oggy. behind you!

1133
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.266
Guys. they've got Oggy.
I'm in pursuit!

1134
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:17.977
Ben?

1135
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.772
Okay. go. This way!

1136
01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:28.863
Ben! Ben!

1137
01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.449
I'm coming. Oggy!

1138
01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.127
Hey!

1139
01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:45.087
Over here. you piece of shit!

1140
01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.078
Ben!

1141
01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.417
Oggy!

1142
01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:25.920
Oggy!

1143
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.632
Go. go. go. go.

1144
01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.978
This way. come on.

1145
01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.628
Guys. in here!

1146
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.894
Guys.

1147
01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.604
Oggs. help me!

1148
01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.481
We need to get out of here. now.

1149
01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.408
No way.
I'm not going down there.

1150
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.869
We can't stay here.

1151
01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:56.719
What is this?

1152
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.804
No idea.

1153
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:02.975
Okay. Try down here.

1154
01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:10.232
Okay. Fine.

1155
01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.650
We'll just--we'll just
stay here for a while.

1156
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.736
-We'll just hide out.
-Why?

1157
01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:15.488
So we can live out
Ben's stupid idea

1158
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:16.864
of living in the sewers
and eating rats.

1159
01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:18.324
Show some respect. That man died

1160
01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.784
saving our lives. Oggs.

1161
01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:22.036
Hannah. shut up!

1162
01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.913
You're not my mom.
Stop telling me what to do.

1163
01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.623
-Oggy. that's enough. Leave it!
-You know what.

1164
01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.291
both of you could shut up.

1165
01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.709
It was your idea to come
to London. wasn't it?

1166
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.795
So don't tell me
he died saving me.

1167
01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:33.214
He died because your little
boyfriend wants to be a hero.

1168
01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.465
Oggs!

1169
01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:36.175
This is no one's fault!

1170
01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.386
We all made this decision.

1171
01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:41.847
And we're gonna have
to stay here. okay?

1172
01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.518
Okay.

1173
01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.771
Whatever.

1174
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.500
Herb?

1175
01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.965
What to do when we...

1176
01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:21.137
go up tomorrow
and the world is...

1177
01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.763
a totally different one?

1178
01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.811
Well. I think the first thing

1179
01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.021
we do obviously is.
is repopulate.

1180
01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.650
What. with your inferior seed?

1181
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.901
That's it.

1182
01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.365
No. I don't know.

1183
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:44.785
I don't even know
if my mom is still okay

1184
01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.412
or if she's up there or--

1185
01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.252
I don't know anything.

1186
01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.882
But we'll be together.

1187
01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:38.005
What?

1188
01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.049
Should we go
and have a look outside?

1189
01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.472
Wait. Wait. Listen.

1190
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.101
Don't hear anything.

1191
01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.645
Yeah.

1192
01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.521
No bombing. no shooting.

1193
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.981
It's all stopped.

1194
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.233
Let's go and have a look.

1195
01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.665
It's too quiet.

1196
01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.000
I think
the military's been wiped out.

1197
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.002
What about everyone
else in London?

1198
01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.006
Something seems wrong.

1199
01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.633
Should we carry on
to Primrose Hill?

1200
01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.343
Yeah. okay.

1201
01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.678
Let's do this.

1202
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.107
Oh. God.

1203
01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:43.988
What on earth?

1204
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.035
It looks like it's dying.

1205
01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.800
Is that--
is that alive?

1206
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.719
I think it's dead.

1207
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.429
Well. listen--
wait. wait. wait. wait.

1208
01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.140
We need to know.

1209
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.808
I don't trust
these guys.

1210
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.235
Right. Let's check it out
but stay in the trees.

1211
01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.070
We don't know
what's happening here.

1212
01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:40.544
Look. What's happened to it?

1213
01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:53.766
It might be
playing dead.

1214
01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.152
Oh.

1215
01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:08.155
Oh. my God. God.

1216
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:09.740
I don't think
they're pretending.

1217
01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.126
Oh. it's Dr. Stint.

1218
01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.588
Oh.

1219
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.257
My students. I am very glad
to see you made it.

1220
01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.259
So what on earth happened?

1221
01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.512
-Simple science.
-What do you mean?

1222
01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:33.222
We tried everything.

1223
01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.225
They defeated our military
at every attempt.

1224
01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.185
What took them down.
Mother Nature.

1225
01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.104
Mother Nature?

1226
01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.231
The bacteria that our body
is perfectly capable

1227
01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.899
of living in harmony with.

1228
01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.943
the Martians.
they couldn't cope with it.

1229
01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.653
So they suffered and they died

1230
01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.738
at the hands of our little
microscopic friends.

1231
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.074
I can't believe
all that tiny bacteria

1232
01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.617
beat these giant Martians.

1233
01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.452
Wait. Hold on.

1234
01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.287
So you're saying...

1235
01:21:57.287 --> 01:22:00.624
that my armpits
are more damaging

1236
01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.960
-than all the Martians combined?
-Oggy!

1237
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.711
-Something like that.
-Yeah. Your armpits

1238
01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:06.880
always have been lethal weapons.
Don't.

1239
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.674
You need to come with us now.

1240
01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.051
Let's connect with the other
survivors in Ostend.

1241
01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:12.928
So are we in the clear?

1242
01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.721
Well. London
and the surrounding areas

1243
01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.474
are gonna stay in quarantine
for some time. I imagine.

1244
01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:19.810
But so far.
there are no alien survivors

1245
01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:22.646
and crucially the landing
has stopped.

1246
01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.565
Dr. Stint. do you copy?

1247
01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:26.233
Sergeant. hi.

1248
01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:27.276
Are they there?

1249
01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.194
Yes. I'm with them now.

1250
01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.571
Excellent. Put them on. please.

1251
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.030
Herbert.
I got some news for you.

1252
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.450
Hello?

1253
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.785
Herbert. Is that you?

1254
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.871
Mom. Where are you?

1255
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.789
Are you okay? Is everyone okay?

1256
01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.416
Yeah. Ogilvy is fine.
Hannah's fine.

1257
01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:45.002
I'm--I'm--I'm fine.

1258
01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.503
They're taking me home.

1259
01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.172
-Will you be there?
-Yeah. okay.

1260
01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:49.798
I'll--I'll--I'll.
um. I'll see you at home.

1261
01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.133
Come quick. Herb.

1262
01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.259
Mom...

1263
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.387
I love you.

1264
01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:56.930
I love you. too. sweetheart.

1265
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.932
I've gotta go.
I'll see you soon.

1266
01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.309
-No.
-Come here.

1267
01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.897
Come on. After you.

1268
01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.857
Thank you.

1269
01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.709
The creatures saw our species

1270
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:28.670
that was self-destructive.

1271
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:32.466
weak. and ready to be conquered
by higher beings.

1272
01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.428
What they didn't count on

1273
01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.347
was that the world we inhabit

1274
01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:43.185
is also home
to the smallest organisms.

1275
01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:46.021
These microbes
became the ultimate protector

1276
01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.356
of humanity

1277
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.983
against these alien invaders.

1278
01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:53.403
The air they breathe. the food
and the water they consumed

1279
01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.948
were slowly killing them
the whole time.

1280
01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:59.243
As humans.

1281
01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.828
we may have lost the battle
on our own

1282
01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.789
but the earth won

1283
01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.374
for now.
