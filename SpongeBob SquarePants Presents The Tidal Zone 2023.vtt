I am Rube-dor.

187
00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.328
I shrunk you down
with my futuristic

188
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.231
shrink suckers
to save you from harm.

189
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.866
- Thanks. Rube-dor.

190
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:50.103
- And to introduce you to
the shimmering. shiny city

191
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.872
of Shmandor.

192
00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.341
[together]
Ooh.

193
00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:57.010
- Shmandor is the place to be.

194
00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:01.081
Shmandor has fine dining.

195
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:02.349
spacious homes.

196
00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:05.385
a state-of-the-art
transit system.

197
00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.655
shopping centers.

198
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:11.759
And conveniently located
under the sea.

199
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:17.364
Shmandor is entirely made
of hand-blown glass.

200
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.400
[together]
Amazing.

201
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.369
- Oh. boy. can we live here?

202
00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.337
- Sure. we can. kids.

203
00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:28.976
Shmandor is so beautiful.
it makes me feel like...

204
00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:30.711
* Singing *

205
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.011
- Hold on!

206
00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:36.383
There's no singing
allowed in Shmandor!

207
00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.852
And that's why!

208
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.287
- Yuck.

209
00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:43.123
Who wants to live in a
place where you can't sing?

210
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.794
* That was a close one *

211
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.063
- * And here comes
a closer one *

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.234
[together]
Ahh!

213
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.468
- We're too small
to be run over.

214
00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.505
- Whew.
- Ha-ha.

215
00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:02.710
- Now. where would I hide
if I was a filthy flea?

216
00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:08.749
- I think it's time to
resume GrandPat's lesson.

217
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:12.519
- I picked this one
up inside Pat-tron.

218
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:16.256
- Whoa! Guh! Ohh!

219
00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.860
My scooter is haunted!

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.211
Aha!

226
00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:43.851
Quit spookin' my wheels
or I'll roast you ghosts!

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.391
Ohh! Ahh!

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:53.493
Ugh!

231
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.163
But I hate mummies!

232
00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:57.998
I gotta get home!

233
00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.067
- [giggles] That was fun.
but what if we're

234
00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.203
too small for the
audience to see us?

235
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.272

Jumbo Grow plant food!

237
00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:14.447
- Be careful!
- It's time to grow up!

238
00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:17.450
- Now I can see
the fine print. Patrick.

239
00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:21.454
It grows plants.
but it shrinks people.

240
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.324
You shrunk us down
to the sub-atomic

241
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.559
teensy-weensy level.

242
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.430
- Ohh. now I'll never
finish tonight's show.

243
00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.532
- Stay together. Stars.

244
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.334
I think there's
a way out of here!

Everything's back to normal.

248
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:42.242
Right?

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.576
[together]
Right!

250
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.479

How can be they be
so sophisticated

254
00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:57.290

259
00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:15.709
- Grandma Frenchy always said
"Don't sweat the small stuff."

260
00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:18.779
And in this small world.
where good things

261
00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:22.549
come in small packages.
it's no small wonder

262
00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.018
that it's the little
things that mean a lot.

263
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:31.291
Especially in the wee small
hours of "The Tidal Zone."

the town of Bikini Bottom.

And where is that quarter

comes at a very high price.

948
00:40:37.202 --> 00:40:39.437

Ow!

980
00:42:02.688 --> 00:42:04.890
I gotta get out

Ehh. close enough.

1022
00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:53.098
- And so we leave things
a little bit weird.

1023
00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:57.135
but that's how we like it
here in "The Tidal Zone."
