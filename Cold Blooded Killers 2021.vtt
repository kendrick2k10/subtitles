10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.213
- [Wife] Do you remember this?

11
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.650
- Is that the cab from Napa?

12
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.690
- It absolutely is.

13
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.750
- Oh. come now. you
have out done yourself.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.723
- Mm. You're worth it.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.963
Next up. some fresh bread.

16
00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.330
- Mm. oh. is that sour dough?

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.754
- Yeah. from San Francisco.

18
00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:07.750
- What did I do to deserve this?

19
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.950
- Walk down memory lane.

20
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.040
- Oh my.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.793
- And last. but not least. your favorite.

22
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.474
- Is that your mother's recipe?

23
00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:19.422
- [Wife] It absolutely is.

24
00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:20.290
- [Husband] Mm. hm. hm!

25
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.123
- I made it fresh last night.

26
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.823
- Oh my. You spoil me.

27
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:25.664
(lips smacking)
- Anything for you.

28
00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:26.497
honey bear.

29
00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:27.330

(glasses clinking)

31
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.423

(doorbell rings)

33
00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:38.261
- Are we expecting someone?

34
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:41.070
(doorbell rings)

35
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.430
No. no. no. no.

36
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.252
I got it. You've done enough.

37
00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.419
Be right back.

38
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.175

51
00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.513
- Charlie. Yeah. now you owe me double.

52
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.210
She brought her fucking
husband and you know

53
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.910
the cleanup alone will be huge.

54
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.660
Don't be a cheap ass.

55
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.805
Would've been a 100.000.

56
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:22.390
(tense dramatic music)

57
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.670
- Do 75.

58
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.323
Send me a photo of the guy.
I'll send you the cash now.

59
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.293
- Cheap ass motherfucker.

60
00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:34.030
(phone beeping)

61
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.817

63
00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:11.233
(knife thuds)
- Ow!

64
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.253
- Listen. kid. I didn't
even know they had a child.

65
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.010
Bad intel on my part.
You're gonna be okay.

66
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.693
Maybe just a few stitches.

67
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.883
You got a lot of moxie.

68
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.133
You remind me a little bit of
myself. Keep your head high.

69
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.343
You're gonna have good days and bad ones.

70
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.240
but hopefully one day
our paths will cross.

71
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.583
- Our paths would definitely cross again.

72
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.800
I am gonna train every
minute of every day.

73
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.800
and when I'm ready. I will
haunt you to hell and back.

74
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.220
And I will rip your heart
out and feed it to you.

75
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.513
You cold-blooded killer!

76
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.016
- Big mistake.

77
00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:18.935
(gunshots banging)

78
00:06:18.935 --> 00:06:22.352
(dramatic intense music)

79
00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:18.180
(dramatic intense music continues)

80
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.200
- Of all the meetings. you
choose to be late to this one.

81
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.000
Do you know how many strings I had

82
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.970
to pull to get this meeting?

83
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.330
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

84
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.020
- Save it. Here's your packet.

85
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.950
The investors are in this
study. They're waiting for you.

86
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.070
They've been going over the packet

87
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.270
while they wait. coffee boss.

88
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.570
- Boss. I like the sound of that. (grunts)

89
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.940
You're sweet.

90
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.011
- And you're late. Get in there.

91
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.261
(tense dramatic music)

92
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.360
- Thank you for coming.

93
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.310
What you have before you
is a proposal to go live

94
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.660
with a service that has been
beta tested in a small town.

95
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.560
Now this app was created to connect buyers

96
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.310
and sellers. providing a unique e-commerce

97
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.940
for a variety of illicit activities that.

98
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.540
until recently. were only available

99
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.740
on the deep and dark webs.

100
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.620
Now we had anticipated that sex trade.

101
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.380
sales of narcotics. would
yield the highest profit.

102
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.870
but ironically. it was the hit services.

103
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.680
That was our highest earner.

104
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.010
We decided to call the app The Kill App.

105
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.110
And if you could turn to page one

106
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.524
in your packets. I'll
tell you how it works.

107
00:09:21.524 --> 00:09:24.524
(upbeat rock music)

108
00:09:39.097 --> 00:09:43.264
(patrons chattering indistinctly)

109
00:10:20.496 --> 00:10:24.329
(upbeat rock music continues)

110
00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:22.070
(upbeat rock music continues)

111
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.830
- Listen. here. bitch.

112
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.566
- [Tammi] I know you were
at my house last night.

113
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:32.399
- [Woman In Black Lace]
Oh. goddammit. Tammi.

114
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.260
how many times am I gonna have

115
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.570
to tell you that I'm not
fucking around with Stan!

116
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.903
Should lay off the coke.

117
00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:39.770
(woman grunts)

118
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.697
Come on. bitch.

119
00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:47.017
(women grunting)

120
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.653
- [Charlie] That's Misty.
younger sister of Rose.

121
00:12:09.653 --> 00:12:11.750
(name bangs)

122
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.120
She's seen better days.

123
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.640
She dipped her toes in the assassin world.

124
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.090
but the problem is she cannot keep

125
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.863
from tripping over her own two feet.

126
00:12:18.733 --> 00:12:21.983
(upbeat intense music)

127
00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.715
(engine revs)

128
00:12:53.965 --> 00:12:56.382
(blow thuds)

129
00:12:57.984 --> 00:13:02.670
(workers chattering indistinctly)

130
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.760
- Jim?
- Shit.

131
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.310
What the fuck did I say about
sneaking in on me like that?

132
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.930
- Jim I had a feeling something
was happening yesterday.

133
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.940
I felt it in my gut. Should have bet you.

134
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.290
- Our Rose's sister's dead.

135
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.720
- How'd you know that's
what I was gonna say?

136
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.920
- Henry called me first.

137
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.563
Said Misty was reported dead this morning.

138
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.350
- So is he gonna give it to us?

139
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.560
- Why wouldn't he?

140
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.070
Wasn't my evidence that led to a mistrial.

141
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.560
Was that motherfucker. DA Jangles.

142
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.460
that's who fucked us on this.

143
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.293
- So we got it.

144
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.050
- Yeah. we got it.

145
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.960
- So what are we still doing here?

146
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.210
This is a big break. Jim.

147
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.800
Why are you reading yesterday's paper?

148
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.540
- Somebody's trying to make a point here.

149
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.790
Coincidences like this
don't happen everyday.

150
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.610
Do you wanna run into an ambush? Hm?

151
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.903
Like fucking last time.

152
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.873
- No. sir.

153
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.830
- Well then. get your gear

154
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.530
and get the fuck out of my office.

155
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.898
Sit around here bullshitting all day.

156
00:14:13.898 --> 00:14:15.611
(workers chattering indistinctly)

157
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:18.611
(knuckles rapping)

158
00:14:20.678 --> 00:14:23.761
(tense somber music)

159
00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:54.313
(Dave vomiting)

160
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.523
- Oh. god. (coughing)

161
00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:04.100
- [Mike] You all right. Dave?

162
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.510
- I'm sorry. Mike. man. I
just ain't never seen nothing

163
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.210
like this before. and you. Becky.

164
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.630
you gotta calm down.

165
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.350
- Don't you tell me to calm down.

166
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.090
You two are gonna screw the pooch on this.

167
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.983
I can hear it marking. Goddammit.

168
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.733
- Listen. Becky.

169
00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:19.630
uh. ma'am.
- Ma'am.

170
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.410
- Don't you call me ma'am.

171
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.560
- Dispatch has already
alerted the city police.

172
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.520
They're already en route.

173
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.353
- I am so relieved.
- That means

174
00:15:25.353 --> 00:15:26.440
that they're on their way. Becky.

175
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.770
- Meanwhile. Tammi's killer's running

176
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.330
around the goddamn countryside.

177
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.940
You're asking me to sit
here with my thumb up my ass

178
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.740
while we wait for a couple of dog dicks

179
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.920
from L.A. to come up here and
waste my motherfucking time.

180
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.160
- Now hold on a second. Becky.

181
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.590
No one asked you to have
your thumb up your ass.

182
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.590
We didn't ask her that. Mike.

183
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.570
- Listen. it's a real shame
what happened to that poor girl.

184
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.403
- Sure is.

185
00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:48.230
- But us running around
on a wild goose chase

186
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.210
is not gonna bring her back

187
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.030
to life looking for some Bentley.

188
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.860
- I mean. besides her eyeball is stuck

189
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.370
to the headlight on this thing. man.

190
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.780
That. that's what they
said over the radio. Mike.

191
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.160
It stuck right on the.
ah. shit. Oh. Jesus.

192
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.817
- Go spew some fucking goo. there he goes!

193
00:16:01.817 --> 00:16:02.650
- There he goes again.

194
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.210
- You know what a wild goose chase?

195
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.320
It's called a search.
Mike. a fucking search!

196
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.510
- Now listen. all right.

197
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.610
there's specific protocols
for things like this.

198
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.280
Leroy's already collected some evidence

199
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.160
and some tire tracks.

200
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.930
And our. our little old station

201
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.830
just can't handle these type of cases.

202
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.403
- No. it's not Mike. No. it's not.

203
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.890
- Oh. now is that?

204
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.581
Ah. shit.
- Just not nice.

205
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:30.248
(Dave vomiting)

206
00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:35.510
Ah. come on. Christ.

207
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.133
Somebody moved the goddamn body! Shit!

208
00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:43.016
(upbeat rock music)

209
00:17:09.627 --> 00:17:12.294
(phone chiming)

210
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:41.994
(upbeat rock music continues)

211
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.401
(lively upbeat music)

212
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.423
- Cops are gone. thank god.

213
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.400
- Where's my sister.

214
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.750
- I don't know that either.

215
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.373
- There's a whole lot of
blood out there. Becky.

216
00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:17.010
And you were supposed to protect her.

217
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.910
- If you wanted to keep her alive.

218
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.623
she should have been with you.

219
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.920
- Give me answers now.

220
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.490
- This isn't a fucking rehab!

221
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.830
You've been on the run
for five goddamn years.

222
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.700
- I don't give a shit
what you're telling me.

223
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.453
Now you go get one of your girls right now

224
00:18:32.453 --> 00:18:34.653
and you tell me where Misty is.

225
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.263
- Anita. get your ass in here.

226
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.723
She was the last one to see her alive.

00:18:42.748 --> 00:18:46.115

251
00:19:44.227 --> 00:19:46.870
- I'm lucky that bitch only sliced me.

252
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.100
Whenever she'd get all coked up.

253
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.877
she always thought I was
fucking her goddamn man.

254
00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:52.190
Like I would want any part of that.

255
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.303
Lord knows what she was
walking around with.

256
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.163
I'm sure Misty's fine.

257
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.873
Threw her in the car pretty
good. but she's a tough chick.

258
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.220

- Gotta stop letting these
girls do so much coke. Becky.

262
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.840
- How do you think I keep 'em twerking

263
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.490
after their little blade parties?

264
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.343
- I think it's Hank.

265
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.400
- I'll go get my shit.

266
00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:27.334
(upbeat rock music)

267
00:20:32.694 --> 00:20:35.611

268

270
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.300
Co-owner of Kill App. and my boss.

271
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.110
He's a. he's a bull in a china shop.

272
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.983
Goes 0 to 60 drop of a hat.

273
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.333
- Whoa! Overkill. Rose?

274
00:21:05.333 --> 00:21:07.060
- Shoulda brought more.

275
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.380
If it's Hank that took my sister.

276
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.590
he'll have every hit man in 60-mile radius

277
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.350
ready to kill me. just like the last time.

278
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.260
- Well. it looks like

279
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.480
you're gonna teach him
a little accountability.

280
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.150
Just don't blow our ass to China doing it.

281
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.643
- Guys. I just got the message.

282
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.733
A million bucks on your hit. Rose.

283
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.580
- [Becky] Hey!

284
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.880
- Are we good?

285
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.100
- Rose. relax. we're
good. we're good. Relax!

286
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.380
- It's good. it's good.

287
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.080
Does it say who posted the hit?

288
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.717
- No. sweetheart. it doesn't. but (sighs)

289
00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:40.380
six free agents have already
been first responders. Rose.

290
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.803
- We gotta get the fuck
outta here. Right now.

291
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.690
- Rose. this was on
Misty's changing table.

292
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.043
- [Hank] Dear Rose. come
out and see the trees.

293
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.170
I just took your sister to Paradise.

294
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.673
Maybe you can meet her there. Love. Hank.

295
00:21:59.593 --> 00:22:03.010
(dramatic intense music)

296
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.005
- Can I get a ride.

297
00:22:05.005 --> 00:22:06.982
- Yeah. just give me a sec.

298
00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:10.482
(gentle reflective music)

299
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.680
- [Hank] I bet your sister thought

300
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.863
I would have given up after five years.

301
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.570
Maybe I would have if that cunt

302
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.313
hadn't killed my brother Quentin.

303
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.530
- I know you guys don't have anything.

304
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.900
What about you. baby?

305
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.850
- Think I'm all in.

306
00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:51.302
(gunshot bangs)

307
00:22:52.265 --> 00:22:55.886
(dark-haired woman sobs)

308
00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:57.996
(dark-haired woman screaming)

309
00:22:57.996 --> 00:22:58.913
No! Please!

310
00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:03.120
(dark-haired woman screaming)

311
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.490
- That's Quentin.
(name bangs)

312
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.409
Hanks older brother. former
member of the kill squad.

313
00:23:08.409 --> 00:23:10.010
(words banging)

314
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.393
Loved cards. women. and liquor.

315
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.420
Problem is. he took out Rose's lover.

316
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.623
backstabbing Rose.

317
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.983
Big mistake.

318
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.090
- When Quentin died. Hank
started losing his shit.

319
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.020
Looked pretty bad for Hank.

320
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.690
C'mon. kid. you remember all this shit

321
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.093
from the case files. right?

322
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.670
That's why I think it's Hank

323
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.920
that's trying to draw
Rose out into the open.

324
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.617
- You might be right.
Jim. but I. I don't know.

325
00:23:42.617 --> 00:23:44.980
The list of people that want to kill Rose.

326
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.480
it goes on and on.

327
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.103
- I got a gut feeling.

328
00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:50.870
(tense suspenseful music)

329
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.120
I'll put a hundred on it.

330
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.993
- [Frankie] You'd bet that much?

331
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:56.860
- No. I'm just fucking with you.

332
00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.810
Look at yesterday's paper.

333
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.953
There's a picture of
Hank in the courtroom.

334
00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:04.740
Told ya. fuckhead. bam!

335
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.573
- Shit.

336
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.160
You know. this photo
doesn't really mean shit.

337
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.203
- That sheriff ever get back to you?

338
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.220
- Nah. I think he's having some trouble.

339
00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:20.020
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

340
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.603
He was gagging on the phone.
Crime scene was really bad.

341
00:24:23.603 --> 00:24:26.393
A stripper's head exploded.

342
00:24:30.056 --> 00:24:31.820
- (chuckles) But he can't dry

343
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.130
his fucking eyes and call you back?

344
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.200
- I'm sure he can. but a
stripper's head exploded.

345
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.650
He's probably a little upset.

346
00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.113
- But he's positive it wasn't Misty?

347
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.063
- [Frankie] Eh.

348
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:53.090
- [Dave] Well. ma'am.
did you see anything?

349
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.343
- Yeah. I saw her fucking head explode.

350
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.740
- Did you get a make or a model?

351
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.523
Even a license plate number? Anything?

352
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.431
- Yeah. it was gray.

353
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:07.310
(phone vibrates)

354
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.163
- Hello? Okay.

355
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.660
Okay. I'll. uh. give you a call

356
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.253
when I get back to the office.

357
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.320
Yeah. Bye now.

358
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.223
So-
- We done?

359
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.040
- No we ain't done!

360
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.050
We got an open investigation here.

361
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.210
- Relax. Becky.

362
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.340
- Don't tell me to relax.

363
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.060
- Now Anita. you know you
ain't out of the woods. right?

364
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.030
I need you to understand that.

365
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.480
- Excuse me?

366
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.930
She tried to fucking
kill me. Michael Dean!

367
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.800
- Listen. I know you're my cousin.

368
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.280
but running around.
shaking your ass for money.

369
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.930
this kind of shit's gonna happen.

370
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.940
Look at you. You coulda got killed.

371
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.773
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'll get
a ride home with Thomas.

372
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.313
- You better watch it.
missy. I got my eye on you!

373
00:26:04.947 --> 00:26:07.510
- All right. listen. Hank.
by bumping up the price

374
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.413
on her head. we are massively
cutting into our profits.

375
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.993
I know. I. I know.

376
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.210
Uh. give it a minute.

377
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.870
There's lots of others
that want her dead. too.

378
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.070
By the end of the day.
the price will go up.

379
00:26:25.356 --> 00:26:27.525
Okay. okay. I'll do it.

380
00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:30.010
(tense suspenseful music)

381
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.140
- [Charlie] Let's break
down this Kill App.

382
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.030
Okay. so here we have our client tracker

383
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.130
where I keep my eyes on where all

384
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.460
of our assassins are at the moment.

385
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.410
As you can see. this locale
is. uh. is packed with 'em.

386
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.360
Tends to happen when there
was a big ticket kill.

387
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.460
At the Command Center. this
is the brain of the app.

388
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.740
you've got the standings
of all our divisions:

389
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.660
assassinations. kidnapping.
even laundering at the bottom.

390
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.980
And on the other list. we got live stats

391
00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.160
on what our clients are doing
in the killing department.

392
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.120
Finally. this is the most
important part. the top kill list.

393
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.137
Most wanted is Rose. More
details will be coming on her.

394
00:27:23.134 --> 00:27:26.634
(dramatic intense music)

395
00:27:34.072 --> 00:27:35.014
- What the fuck are you doing?

396
00:27:35.014 --> 00:27:37.597
(phone chimes)

397
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.093
- I'm thinking about six million bucks.

398
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.173
Are you in?

399
00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:52.327
Good. Now shut up.

400
00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:10.616
(chainsaw buzzing)

401
00:28:10.616 --> 00:28:15.616
- Rose!
(man with chainsaw yelling)

402
00:28:20.003 --> 00:28:22.670
(gunshot bangs)

403
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.334
- You sorry son of a bitch.

404
00:28:26.334 --> 00:28:27.970
(gunshot bangs)

405
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.250
Your price just popped up.

406
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.433
You're trending at 10 million.
We gotta hit the road.

407
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.113
I'll take that. you
miserable motherfucker.

408
00:28:43.457 --> 00:28:46.040
(bullet bangs)

409
00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:51.253
- (laughs) I got you. bitch.

410
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.933
Ah. what the fuck?

411
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.073
Ah. what the fuck?

412
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.413
This is Spurlock. right? Ah. shit!

413
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.713
Roll it down.

414
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.410
This is Spurlock County. right?

415
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.260
- I don't know.

416
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.116
- Oh. ho. you don't
fucking know either. huh?

417
00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:24.700
(sighs) So you think you can keep

418
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.897
your mouth shut about all this?

419
00:29:26.897 --> 00:29:28.747
- Yes. yes. I can keep my mouth shut.

420
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.470
- [Dispatcher] Sir. an officer

421
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.530
is en route to your location.

422
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.893
You said he was overweight
and white male. That correct?

423
00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:44.097
- Really? What the fuck?

424
00:29:44.097 --> 00:29:46.294
(gunshots banging)

425
00:29:46.294 --> 00:29:49.877
(tense suspenseful music)

426
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.323
- It's Rose.

427
00:30:12.264 --> 00:30:14.931
(phone chiming)

428
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.270
- Wait. this thing is saying
my last known whereabouts

429
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.240
are at a gas station in Spurlock.

430
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.822
- Could be Charlie laying down cover.

431
00:30:26.822 --> 00:30:28.100
(phone chiming)

432
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.140
Uh-oh. Hank just pinned
12 million on your tail.

433
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.580
- [Rose] Not worried about that.

434
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.423
Hank won't be alive to pay anyone.

435
00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.860
- [Dispatcher] 30-35.
40-50 to 35. come in.

436
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.710
- Maybe that wasn't Charlie.

437
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:43.543
- [Reporter] Shooting reported

438
00:30:43.543 --> 00:30:45.955
in Spurlock on Barbara Avenue.

439
00:30:45.955 --> 00:30:48.872
The suspect is armed and dangerous.

440
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:56.467
- So you two boys are telling
me you didn't see nothing?

441
00:30:57.462 --> 00:30:58.295
- [Man In Tank Top] The
guy went pretty fast.

442
00:30:58.295 --> 00:30:59.270
sir. it's hard to say.

443
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.430
- Driving fast.

444
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.340
I pulled you over. you were
doing 10 miles an hour.

445
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.990
That fast for you? What about you?

446
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.530
- We thought we heard some firecrackers.

447
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.633
- Firecrackers.

448
00:31:09.633 --> 00:31:10.466
(Joe chuckles)

449
00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:11.350
Okay. and what is this here?

450
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.741
This a devil shirt you're wearing?

451
00:31:12.741 --> 00:31:13.574
- [Man In Black Shirt] No. sir?

452
00:31:13.574 --> 00:31:15.428
- Are you smoking the devil's lettuce?

453
00:31:15.428 --> 00:31:16.345
- Hm.
- Huh?

454
00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:33.822
(upbeat rock music)

455
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.961
- [Charlie] Uh. that's Pete.

456
00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:55.310
(name bangs)

457
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.860
right-hand man of Hank.

458
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.560
He's as savvy as you get.

459
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.453
master manipulator. and
loves to stir the pot.

460
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.350
Killing to him is. uh. it's a game.

461
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.550
and he is one of the
top earners on the app.

462
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.603
- Uh. how. how can I help
you ladies get started?

463
00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:21.357
- Are you okay?

464
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.673
- My. uh. my sister. she.

465
00:32:28.433 --> 00:32:30.150
can I start you off with
some coffees or something?

466
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.710
- Sure. uh. two coffees and regular sugar.

467
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.543
That's great.

468
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.780
- Anything for you. miss?

469
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.840
Two coffees with regular
sugar. Anything else?

470
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.455
- [Becky] Uh. for right now? That's fine.

471
00:32:44.455 --> 00:32:45.288
- I'll. uh-
- Thanks.

472
00:32:45.288 --> 00:32:46.543
- I'll be right back with that.

473
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.397
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

474
00:32:53.397 --> 00:32:55.064
- No guns. Too loud.

475
00:32:59.285 --> 00:33:02.535
(tense sinister music)

476
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.020
- That's Will.
(name bangs)

477
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.200
not brightest of the bunch.

478
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.770
He came to the U.S. via Austria.

479
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.040
It's not really the money
that drives him to kill.

480
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.053
It's the thrill.

481
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.666
The app is a godsend for him.

482
00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:58.666
(gentle calm music)

483
00:34:05.484 --> 00:34:08.151
(phone beeping)

484
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.203
- Fuck do I let these bitches
talk me into this shit?

485
00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:11.981
(dramatic intense music)

486
00:35:45.951 --> 00:35:48.618
(phone ringing)

487
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.000
- Told you leaving me here would pay off.

488
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.603
Since we're good friends.
I'll only take half.

489
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:02.130
- [Hank] That's not
what we agreed on. Pete.

490
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:06.730
Don't overstep this deal. You
know how I feel about deals.

491
00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.330
Look. it was your idea to increase

492
00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.780
the rate to get more hitters.

493
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.280
- Ah. fuck. it's Anita!

494
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.570
I told you to tell that
bitch to stay in the car.

495
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.170
- She's crashing from coke.

496
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.800
Usually she turns into Sleeping Beauty.

497
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.368
I don't understand what's happening.

498
00:36:25.368 --> 00:36:27.868
- Look. I don't give a
fuck. Just don't kill Pete.

499
00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:30.328
- [Becky] Okay. I'll wait.

500
00:36:30.328 --> 00:36:33.745
(dramatic intense music)

501
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:46.684
(phone chimes)

502
00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:49.250
(Anita screaming)

503
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.841
- Shit!

504
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:51.674
(knife whooshes)

505
00:36:51.674 --> 00:36:54.023
(hitman screams)

506
00:36:54.023 --> 00:36:56.606
(guns banging)

507
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:04.638
- Jesus Christ. Joe!

508
00:37:05.662 --> 00:37:08.162
(gun banging)

509
00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:13.523
- We need you to come
out with your hands up.

510
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:16.770
Look. there's no reason to be rude.

511
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.170
We put a call into the state police.

512
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.920
They're gonna be here any minute.

513
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.420
(dramatic intense music)

514
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.613
- Rose?

515
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.583
Where are you. Rose?

516
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.580
- Where the fuck is your friend. Hank?

517
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.259
(gun bangs)

518
00:37:45.259 --> 00:37:46.637
- Hank? I don't know what
you're talking about.

519
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.081
Who the fuck is that?
(gun banging)

520
00:37:54.081 --> 00:37:55.100
(gun banging)

521
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.750
- Oh. I bet you say that to
all the girls. huh. Pete?

522
00:37:58.806 --> 00:38:00.249
(gun banging)

523
00:38:00.249 --> 00:38:02.680
(Pete chuckles)

524
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.620
- Yeah. and they usually end up

525
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.609
just like you're about to. bitch.

526
00:38:08.609 --> 00:38:11.192
(guns banging)

527
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.410
- Listen. fellas. I'm
gonna head out round back.

528
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.401
You guys gonna be okay?

529
00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:17.234
- Yeah. yeah. we gotcha. Joe.

530
00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:19.610
Go. go. go. go. go. go!
- All right.

531
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.523
- Shit. Mike. what are we gonna do. man?

532
00:38:21.523 --> 00:38:24.223
- Hey. Dave. call Nancy. We need backup.

533
00:38:26.485 --> 00:38:27.803
(gun banging)

534
00:38:27.803 --> 00:38:30.720
(glass shattering)

535
00:38:31.774 --> 00:38:33.224
We got backup coming from the city.

536
00:38:33.224 --> 00:38:34.384
They're gonna be here any minute.

537
00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.884
(gun banging)

538
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.560
- Nancy. Dave. I need Carl down here. man.

539
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.843
What?

540
00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:44.860
- [Nancy] Carl's got the flue.

541
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.290
- What do you mean Carl's got the flu?

542
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.370
Nancy. I don't give a
fuck if he's got diarrhea

543
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.550
shooting out of his goddamn ass. man.

544
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.703
We. we're in a real shoot-out here

545
00:38:51.703 --> 00:38:54.620
with real criminals. man.
and they got big guns!

546
00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.090
Nancy. we need backup and we need it now.

547
00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.400
- [Nancy] She is 60!

548
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.777
- I don't give a fuck
if the man's 60. Nancy!

549
00:39:00.777 --> 00:39:03.810
Are you listening to me?
Get his ass down here.

550
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.059
(gentle calm music)

551
00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:07.726
(phone beeping)

552
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.018
(dramatic intense music)

553
00:40:04.393 --> 00:40:06.393
- Oh. you're in here. you fucking bitch.

554
00:40:29.435 --> 00:40:30.654
(Rose grunts)

555
00:40:30.654 --> 00:40:31.487
(hitman grunts)

556
00:40:31.487 --> 00:40:34.070
(hitman yells)

557
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.130
- Dave. what here?

558
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.080
- Just tell her to give those
detectives our location.

559
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.020
We need them here now.

560
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.640
- All right. hey. Nancy. listen.

561
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.890
Tell them L.A. dicks that we're at

562
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.250
the Harvest Steakhouse in Spurlock

563
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.500
and we need some backup
right now. goddammit!

564
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.430
Shit. Mike. what are we gonna do. man?

565
00:41:06.408 --> 00:41:07.241
(gun cocks)

566
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:08.150
Oh. hell no.

567
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.253
- Drop that shit. Slide it over.

568
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.870
- Becky. don't you make
me fucking shoot you.

569
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.490
- [Becky] I will open up that empty head

570
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.450
like a goddamn watermelon!

571
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.510
Drop 'em!
- Okay. all right. okay.

572
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.720
Easy. easy. Take it easy.

573
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.560
There you go.

574
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.460
- You're my bitch now.

575
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.310
Get those cuffs out.
cuff yourselves together.

576
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.086
- I don't have the pink. furry ones. I-

577
00:41:30.086 --> 00:41:30.919
- Now!

578
00:41:30.919 --> 00:41:31.752
- Okay. all right. all right.
- Do it!

579
00:41:31.752 --> 00:41:32.630
- All right. all right. Becky.

580
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.460
Easy. easy now. Look. I'm
just reaching for my cuffs.

581
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.478
Okay? Okay?
- Good boy.

582
00:41:36.478 --> 00:41:38.440
- Here we go. All right.

583
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.130
- Cuff yourselves together.
- All right. All right.

584
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.362
Come on. Becky. Don't
point that thing at me now.

585
00:41:47.362 --> 00:41:48.195
Come on!

586
00:41:48.195 --> 00:41:49.162
- [Becky] Okay. on your feet!

587
00:41:49.162 --> 00:41:49.995
- Calm down. Becky.

588
00:41:49.995 --> 00:41:50.828
- [Becky] On the fuck things now!

589
00:41:50.828 --> 00:41:52.131
- Okay. okay. okay. okay!

590
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:54.127
Okay. okay.
- Now. walk to the back door.

591
00:41:54.127 --> 00:41:54.960
- Okay. okay.

592
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.830
- Back it up.
- Okay. okay.

593
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.663
- [Becky] Hey. come on!

594
00:41:57.663 --> 00:41:58.928
- Okay. all right.
- Now.

595
00:41:58.928 --> 00:42:00.390
- Okay.
- I will shoot you.

596
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.709
- We're walking. We're walking now.

597
00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:04.109
Give me another second. okay.

598
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.942
- [Pete] Shit!

599
00:42:04.942 --> 00:42:06.486
(dramatic intense music)

600
00:42:06.486 --> 00:42:08.986
(gun banging)

601
00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:12.950
(gun bangs)
(Pete yells)

602
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.040
Fuck!

603
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.853
- Ya dumb fuck!

604
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.380
Give me the fucking gun.

605
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.457
And you're gonna get in
the fucking chair now.

606
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.333
Faster.

607
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.570
(Pete grunts)

608
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.863
That's a good boy. Pete.

609
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.720
I'm gonna ask you one more time

610
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.963
or I'm gonna tie you up. asshole.

611
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.673
- Oh. you're gonna tie me up?

612
00:42:48.545 --> 00:42:50.345
You haven't even taken me to dinner.

613
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.353
- [Rose] Last chance.

614
00:42:56.584 --> 00:42:57.750
- You know what?

615
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.730
I think I'm gonna bust all your teeth out

616
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:02.403
and fuck your mouth.

617
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.683
- Put the rope over your head.

618
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:13.127
- Okay. bitch. Now I
have to tie myself up?

619
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.143
- Put the fucking rope
over your fucking head.

620
00:43:20.175 --> 00:43:22.836
(Pete chuckles)

621
00:43:22.836 --> 00:43:24.033
Do it.

622
00:43:24.033 --> 00:43:28.283
(dramatic intense music continues)

623
00:43:33.907 --> 00:43:36.130
And now you're gonna tell me.

624
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.093
where did Hank take my sister?

625
00:43:43.953 --> 00:43:47.823
- You know. you keep asking
me about this fucking Hank.

626
00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.393
I don't know who the fuck he is. (laughs)

627
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.800
- Becky.

628
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.063
Put your foot on the gas
and move forward 10 feet.

629
00:44:01.983 --> 00:44:04.733
(engine revving)

630
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.290
Fuck is Hank?

631
00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:20.176
(Pete gasping)

632
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.090
- [Pete] You don't have the balls. bitch.

633
00:44:23.942 --> 00:44:25.083
You don't have the-

634
00:44:25.083 --> 00:44:27.666
(Pete screams)

635
00:44:29.504 --> 00:44:31.004
You fucking bitch!

636
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.190
- I don't need balls. sweetie.

637
00:44:36.334 --> 00:44:39.043
- That Paradise Cove. (gasping)

638
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.960
Don't fucking act like you don't remember.

639
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.330
That's where you killed Hank's brother.

640
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.930
Didn't you get Hank's love note?

641
00:44:50.975 --> 00:44:54.392
(dramatic intense music)

642
00:44:55.399 --> 00:44:57.899
(gun banging)

643
00:44:59.549 --> 00:45:02.132
(guns banging)

644
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.509
- God. man. Mike. I don't wanna
die today. son of a bitch!

645
00:45:21.509 --> 00:45:23.383
(grunts) Shit. man!

646
00:45:30.039 --> 00:45:31.780
- We're connected!

647
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.280
- Hey! Now don't you
girls try to chase us.

648
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.749
Give me the fucking key! Both of 'em. now!

649
00:45:38.749 --> 00:45:40.933
- Okay. okay. okay. shit. Goddammit.

650
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.960
Fuck.
- Come on!

651
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.980
- Give a pinch.
- Okay. okay. okay.

652
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.203
okay. okay. son of a bitch!

653
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.683
She does got a nice ass. though. Mike.

654
00:45:49.945 --> 00:45:51.920
- What?
- Okay. shit. fuck. all right!

655
00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:55.854
(guns banging)

656
00:45:55.854 --> 00:45:59.021
(dramatic rock music)

657
00:46:12.881 --> 00:46:14.282
- Oh. fuck!

658
00:46:14.282 --> 00:46:17.940
Dave. Dave!
- Oh. shit. goddammit!

659
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.780
- Dave!
- Son of a bitch!

660
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.050
- Goddamn!
- Did they hit me. man?

661
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.017
Am I hit. I'm hit. I'm a goddamn.

662
00:46:24.017 --> 00:46:25.970
just listen to me. Mike.

663
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.447
Just feed my goldfish
for me. will you. man?

664
00:46:28.447 --> 00:46:29.437
- [Mike] Oh. stop!

665
00:46:29.437 --> 00:46:33.105
- Aw. shit! God! (grunts)

666
00:46:33.105 --> 00:46:34.188
- Fuck. Fuck!

667
00:46:35.815 --> 00:46:38.732
(gunshots banging)

668
00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:42.560
- (grunts) You stole
my kill. motherfucker!

669
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.590
- I almost fucking had her. man!

670
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.423
Fuck you!

671
00:46:48.033 --> 00:46:49.364
Fucked up my shot.

672
00:46:49.364 --> 00:46:50.593
You fucked up my shot!

673
00:46:50.593 --> 00:46:51.760
You fucked up!

674
00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:55.845
- Fuck! (grunts)

675
00:46:58.903 --> 00:47:01.486
(guns banging)

676
00:47:02.722 --> 00:47:04.889
- Fucked up my shot. dude!

677
00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.673
- You ready?

678
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.683
- [Rose] Hit it.

679
00:47:14.683 --> 00:47:17.350
(Mike grunting)

680
00:47:27.067 --> 00:47:28.660
- You son of a bitch.

681
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.060
I can't believe you fucking
made me miss my hit!

682
00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:37.310
(phone ringing)

683
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.357
Fucking amateur hour
over here. Jesus Christ.

684
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:44.460
- [Hank] Buzz. hello.

685
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.460
- Where the fuck do
you find these hitters?

686
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.740
I remember when you had
to have at least 10 kills

687
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.390
before you even got in the fucking system.

688
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.520
- I had to add some fresh blood

689
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.230
in the mix to keep you
old guys on your toes.

690
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.180
- Huh?

691
00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.360
Oh yeah. this.
everybody-gets-a-trophy mentality.

692
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.550
it's gotta stop. it's getting you nowhere.

693
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.290
- Well. we all can't be
made as good as you. Buzz.

694
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.630
What's the situation on the ground?

695
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:10.893
- Oh yeah. everybody's dead.

696
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.963
It's a fucking shitshow down here.

697
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800
- I'm working on it.

698
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.330
Pete was supposed to handle it.

699
00:48:19.332 --> 00:48:21.123
Oh. she won't last the night.

700
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.910
She's trending on the app.

701
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.170
- Okay. let me ask you this.

702
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.120
Is the price really gonna go up

703
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.420
because (laughs) I can just wait

704
00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.820
till it hits 20 million and retire.

705
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.590
- Don't get cocky on me. Buzz.

706
00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.847
It's basic economics. okay?

707
00:48:34.847 --> 00:48:38.493
You know. the price
fluctuates based on the needs.

708
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.000
So right now. she's in the lead.

709
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.313
but she's on the top of the list.

710
00:48:45.218 --> 00:48:47.570
but the minute could be anyone else.

711
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.677
Money can be on someone else. maybe you.

712
00:48:50.616 --> 00:48:51.449
(gun bangs)

713
00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:54.866
(dramatic intense music)

714
00:49:08.084 --> 00:49:09.143
- [Charlie] That's Anita.

715
00:49:09.143 --> 00:49:11.103
one of Hank's go-to killers.

716
00:49:11.103 --> 00:49:13.200
(name bangs)

717
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.186
She's a slick one.

718
00:49:15.186 --> 00:49:18.270
Soon as the app launched. she
hit the top three earners.

719
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.920
She'll take your lunch and
make you happy she did it.

720
00:49:24.636 --> 00:49:27.303
(phone chiming)

721
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.367
- Hank. she's killed Pete.

722
00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:36.530
- [Hank] They didn't even
make it a clean kill.

723
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.730
They made Pete suffer.

724
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.880
This is something we
can't afford to let go.

725
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.363
- Keep your money. Hank. This is personal.

726
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.870
- [Hank] Thatta girl.

727
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.030
- The cops are coming. I gotta go.

728
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.986
Do I still get the
million for the Buzz hit?

729
00:49:50.986 --> 00:49:51.960
- [Hank] I'll handle that.

730
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.793
- Okay.

731
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.780
- Marilyn. you already fuckin' up.

732
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.064
- [Charlie] That's Al.

733
00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:01.200
(name bangs)

734
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.230
Anita's partner. former Marine.

735
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.810
He is the toughest of the bunch.

736
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.170
As a POW. he had his eye carved out

737
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.983
without leaking a word of intel.

738
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:11.860
- Take the money.

739
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.960
You're already gonna end
up killing this bitch.

740
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.613
Don't. don't regret taking
that money from Hank.

741
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.263
Trust me.

742
00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.630
- Rose'll pay for this.
Don't you worry about that.

743
00:50:33.045 --> 00:50:36.462
(dramatic intense music)

744
00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:52.825
- Ow. fuck! Shit.

745
00:51:56.636 --> 00:51:57.867
- Trina.
- No!

746
00:51:57.867 --> 00:51:59.140
- [Shark] This is the last one. Hank.

747
00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.910
Caught this coward hiding in the kitchen.

748
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:02.240
- [Hank] Perfect.

749
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.347
- Please. this is all me

750
00:52:03.347 --> 00:52:04.592
and my family have.
- Thank you.

751
00:52:04.592 --> 00:52:05.425
- [Husband] I. I-

752
00:52:05.425 --> 00:52:08.080
- I got news for you.
pal. I own this place now.

753
00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.633
So no one's gonna do a
goddamn thing. you got it?

754
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.820
- Please! My family!

755
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.750
- Oh. my family!

756
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.770
You think anyone gave a
shit about my family? Huh?

757
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:23.260
My brother was shot right
here in this very restaurant.

758
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.342
- I'm sorry. please just let my family go.

759
00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:26.175
and let the help go-
- Hey. hey.

760
00:52:26.175 --> 00:52:28.080
shut the fuck up!

761
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:28.913
All right?

762
00:52:28.913 --> 00:52:30.320
If I hear you say another goddamn thing

763
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.810
about your family. I will rape your wife

764
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.235
in front of your daughters
and the cleaning lady.

765
00:52:36.235 --> 00:52:40.068
Do you understand? Not
a goddamn fucking word.

766
00:52:41.447 --> 00:52:44.463
Are we on the same page? Sh.

767
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.264
Take him out and tie up his family-

768
00:52:48.264 --> 00:52:49.097
- No. but just. just a-

769
00:52:49.097 --> 00:52:49.955
(hand smacking)

770
00:52:49.955 --> 00:52:51.595
- No!

771
00:52:51.595 --> 00:52:54.583
- Listen to me! Shut the fuck up!

772
00:52:56.275 --> 00:52:58.460
Thought you said you understood.

773
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.143
Zip it! Fuck!

774
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.910
Tie his mouth up. tell the cook

775
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.143
there's two more coming
for dinner. thank you.

776
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.023
- Why are we keeping
these people alive. Hank?

777
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.242
- Ah. you know what. Shark?
I fucked this shot up.

778
00:53:17.242 --> 00:53:19.781
- (sobs) No!

779
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:22.281
- You know what? You're right.

780
00:53:23.731 --> 00:53:25.191
(gun banging)

781
00:53:25.191 --> 00:53:26.346
(child squealing)

782
00:53:26.346 --> 00:53:29.930
Hey. hey. hey. hey. zip
it! I'm not gonna kill you.

783
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:34.840
Who's gonna clean the
rooms. right? (laughs)

784
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.853
Did I sink anything?

785
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.203
Let's hit the nice balls.

786
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.810
You can clean up the mess. You are a maid.

787
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.430
Jesus Christ. Can you re-rack this. Shark?

788
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.370
- You got it. boss.

789
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:49.620
- Fucking terrible break.

790
00:54:01.316 --> 00:54:05.247
- The fuck? Your price
just dropped eight million.

791
00:54:05.247 --> 00:54:06.500
- (sighs) It's gotta be a set-up.

792
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.210
Hank. he is way too sharp himself.

793
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.000
and he thinks he's gonna kill me.

794
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.243
- That is garage sale shit. man.

795
00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.350
I mean. are you sure that
was Marilyn's husband?

796
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:16.470
I'd be more afraid of Marilyn

797
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.780
than I would that cheap shit Hank.

798
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.480
- I'm not worried about Marilyn.

799
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.750
- We gotta have a game plan. okay?

800
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:24.920
I mean. we can't just cut and paste

801
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.330
and show up like we did last time.

802
00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:27.570
- [Rose] Why can't we?

803
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.830
- Because you still have
eight million on your head.

804
00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:32.940
Hitters gonna be coming
out of the woodwork

805
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.300
like flies on shit.

806
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.330
- All right. we're gonna
get these cons at night.

807
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.060
We're gonna park behind the hill

808
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.060
and we're gonna run the
guns down the restaurant.

809
00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.180
- I don't think it's a good idea.

810
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.240
We gotta be fresh.

811
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.903
William's Lake is three hours away.

812
00:54:47.587 --> 00:54:48.690
- [Rose] I don't care about the time.

813
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.940
I need to get to Misty.

814
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.030
- And if you're not on your game.

815
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.830
you can't do your sister any good.

816
00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.730
When's the last time you slept?

817
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.363
- [Rose] I drove straight through.

818
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:02.700
- What we need is a
automotive opportunity.

819
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.890
Okay? This car is hot.

820
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.280
If we get popped before we get to Misty.

821
00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.573
your sister is fucked.

822
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.603
- You're sure they were
headed to Paradise Cove.

823
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.180
- Yes. sir.

824
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.550
I heard that poor fellow scream it

825
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:18.930
when Rose was cutting his hand off.

826
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:19.763
- Inside?

827
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.893
- Such a nice place.
though. that Paradise Cove.

828
00:55:26.177 --> 00:55:27.470
I love the smell of the
Lake in the morning.

829
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.260
you know. bacon and eggs.

830
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.788
Just looking out over the water.

831
00:55:31.788 --> 00:55:33.893
it's a beautiful thing.
- And shut the fuck up.

832
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:41.060
- Sir. Are we good to kill these bitches?

833
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.170
I have to be honest with y'all.

834
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:45.230
My cousin Anita. she was shot
right in the head in Spurlock.

835
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.080
- Shut the fuck up. Captain.

836
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.430
We got four hours before
we get to Paradise Cove.

837
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.330
You guys need to shut the fuck up.

838
00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:56.210
Nobody's calling anybody.
Nobody's radioing anybody.

839
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.070
Rose is smart. She's gonna be listening.

840
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.830
The more people we tip
off to our following her.

841
00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:02.633
the harder she is going to run.

842
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.043
And we are going to do
things differently this time.

843
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.573
We're gonna surprise that bitch.

844
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.020
She is gonna be sitting there.
minding her own business.

845
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.000
and I am gonna show up
and pistol whip that cunt

846
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.200
into next fucking week.

847
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.220
you're gonna slap the cuffs
on her for the last time.

848
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.690
- See. Jim here was the only one who ever

849
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:27.193
arrested the killer Rose.

850
00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.720
What's ironic is he arrested
her at the Paradise Cove.

851
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.553
- [Mike] You don't say?

852
00:56:32.553 --> 00:56:36.593
- Yeah. he hit her with his car.

853
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.310
Slammed right into or out of nowhere.

854
00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.627
Then I did slap the cuffs on her.

855
00:56:44.415 --> 00:56:46.715
and a year later she
walked on a technicality.

856
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.180
It was fucking DA
Jangles. it was his fault.

857
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.350
You could have been quite a detective.

858
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.433
- Shut the fuck up. okay?

859
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.570
- I'm sorry about your cousin.

860
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.753
- Thanks.

861
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:14.870
- It's like the good old days. huh. Becky?

862
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:17.070
- Yeah. I can't believe
that shit went down.

863
00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.083
You know. Rose. I'm sorry about Misty.

864
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:26.773
I shoulda covered for her.

865
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.230
- I don't blame anyone but myself. Becky.

866
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:33.160
I shot Hank's brother. not you or Misty.

867
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.223
Should never have taken that contract.

868
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.210
- Well. there's only one thing left to do.

869
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.990
And that means we jack a
car. put some road behind us.

870
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.090
find a place to sleep.

871
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.053
- [Rose] Tired?

872
00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.173
(Becky laughs)

873
00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:55.590
(dramatic intense music)

874
00:57:59.192 --> 00:58:02.025
(bullets banging)

875
00:58:03.072 --> 00:58:03.905
- Fuck.

876
00:58:05.973 --> 00:58:08.642
(hitwoman screams)

877
00:58:08.642 --> 00:58:12.392
(hitwoman and Rose grunting)

878
00:58:26.539 --> 00:58:29.456
(hitwoman yelling)

879
00:58:40.958 --> 00:58:44.237
(Rose inhales)

880
00:58:44.237 --> 00:58:45.517
I got fucking shot!

881
00:58:45.517 --> 00:58:46.650
I got fucking shot!

882
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.740
10 years ago. that shit
wouldn't have got past me.

883
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.790
Goddammit.

884
00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.420
- [Rose] We need to find another car.

885
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.253
- Maybe a doctor? I don't know.

886
00:58:52.253 --> 00:58:53.379
What do you think?
- No. no. no.

887
00:58:53.379 --> 00:58:54.630
I got a kit in my car.
- What do you think?

888
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:55.620
Maybe. I don't think it's that bad.

889
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.137
It's not that bad. CEC scotch.

890
00:58:58.137 --> 00:58:59.650
CEC scotch. that's all I need.

891
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:00.769
- Here. you're okay.
- Let's go.

892
00:59:00.769 --> 00:59:02.269
- Let's go.
- Okay.

893
00:59:07.159 --> 00:59:10.110
(Misty whimpering)

894
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:12.370
- Gentlemen. I wanna thank everybody

895
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.770
for coming out here tonight.

896
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.290
Now I'm hoping that one of you cretins

897
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:19.583
can kill this fucking bitch. Rose.

898
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.980
Now you're all part of the elite.

899
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.443
So do not disappoint me.

900
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.670
I don't know when she's gonna show up.

901
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:28.220
but I can guarantee you this.

902
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.333
When she does. this bitch is
gonna be armed to the tits.

903
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.540
Don't take her lightly.

904
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.010
Everybody get out of
their Kill App right now.

905
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:42.583
Get a visual on the mark.
Get an ID on this bitch.

906
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.520
You're looking at the bitch

907
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.090
that killed my brother right here in this.

908
00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:55.373
And right here is where
that cunt is gonna die.

909
00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.013
You know what? I'm gonna
sweeten the pot a bit.

910
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.160
Whichever one of you cretins can bring

911
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.680
that fucking bitch to me
alive and in the handcuffs.

912
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.040
I'm gonna toss in a $2 million bonus buff.

913
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.429
- [Cretins] Yeah!

914
01:00:10.429 --> 01:00:12.129
- Oh. now I've got your attention.

915
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:17.650
Let's go. Yeah.

916
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:22.650
This way. this way. first
thing in the morning.

917
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.050
I can put a fucking bullet
in that bitch's head myself.

918
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:28.082
- [Cretins] Yeah!

919
01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:29.270
- Wait a minute. no. this way.

920
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.820
First thing in the morning.

921
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.347
I make her watch me cut
your fucking head off.

922
01:00:34.428 --> 01:00:37.079
Then I put a fucking bullet
in that bitch's skull.

923
01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:38.257
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

924
01:00:38.257 --> 01:00:40.135
- You like that? Yeah?

925
01:00:40.135 --> 01:00:40.968
(Misty whimpers)

926
01:00:40.968 --> 01:00:42.073
Oh. yeah. you lik that. Nice.

927
01:00:44.297 --> 01:00:47.340
(sighs) Well. I'm tuckered out.

928
01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.350
I'm gonna go to bed.
You're gonna keep me warm.

929
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.900
Let's go. Gentlemen. happy hunting buff.

930
01:00:55.637 --> 01:00:58.350
- Shark and I'll be
placing side bets. too.

931
01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:00.210
if anyone's interested.

932
01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.950
- Think you all know who to bet on.

933
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.300
- C'mon. Shark. We all
know you're a shit shot.

934
01:01:05.617 --> 01:01:07.540
- That was one fucking time.

935
01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.683
Besides. I don't need to
be good shot with this.

936
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.930
All right. fellas. bar's open.
handle your fucking business.

937
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:16.303
Let's go.

938
01:01:16.303 --> 01:01:19.303
(upbeat rock music)

939
01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:52.041
(gentle calm music)

940
01:01:55.996 --> 01:02:00.580
- (sighs) All right. what
you two lovebirds need

941
01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.930
to remember is I outrank you both.

942
01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:05.890
so you can cuddle it up on
the floor there together.

943
01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:08.610
- I don't care. Jim.
I'll sleep in my clothes.

944
01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:10.647
It's better than sleeping in the car.

945
01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:12.147
- You and your gratitude shit.

946
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.930
- Jim. I think the deputy's right.

947
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.400
We should let one slip in
the back of Rose's head.

948
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:27.693
- The fuck are you talking
about. let one slip?

949
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.090
- Talking about a fucking bullet. Jim.

950
01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.873
right in the back of Rose's skull.

951
01:02:34.978 --> 01:02:36.373
No bad evidence this time.

952
01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.961
Two plugs in the back of her head.

953
01:02:40.961 --> 01:02:41.794
- Would you listen to him?

954
01:02:41.794 --> 01:02:43.413
Are you listening to yourself?

955
01:02:44.513 --> 01:02:47.113
This sound like something
a cop should be saying?

956
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.693
- Jim. keep an open mind.

957
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.923
- Hey. Dep. would you get us some ice?

958
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.330
- Sir. I'm all ready for
bed. I'm in my underwear.

959
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:01.280
- I can smell that.

960
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.160
And you're not in bed.

961
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.510
so get your fucking ass
up and get us some ice.

962
01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:11.173
- (sighs) Fine. I'll go get some damn ice.

963
01:03:15.067 --> 01:03:18.417
- Don't be afraid to hit the
shower on the way back through.

964
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.513
- What the fuck?

965
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.650
Course I'd love to kill the bitch.

966
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.710
but you're gonna say something
like that in front of him?

967
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:31.150
I don't know this deputy. Do you?

968
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.046
Do you know this deputy?

969
01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:33.879
- Well. no. they-

970
01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:34.712
- Okay. then why the fuck would you say

971
01:03:34.712 --> 01:03:37.160
something like that in front of him?

972
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.640
Hey. we were partners long before

973
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.980
all this AA positivity
honesty bullshit. okay.

974
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.880
Now. would you say something like that

975
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.850
in front of your wife?

976
01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:50.293
- Jim. I just wanted us to be
on the same page. that's all.

977
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.703
- I'll talk to him in the morning.

978
01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.000
I'll tell him to do it.

979
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.740
That's a win-win for everybody.

980
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:06.993
What the fuck?

981
01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.090
Course I'd love to kill the bitch.

982
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:12.940
but you're gonna say something
like that in front of him?

983
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:18.610
I'll talk to him in the morning.

984
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.920
I'll tell him to do it.

985
01:04:26.273 --> 01:04:27.867
That's a win-win for everybody.

986
01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.780
- Mav. tell Hanger's there's
gonna be cops of the event.

987
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.330
It's the two detectives.
they wanna kill Rose. too.

988
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.220
- I was hoping you'd say that.

989
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.370
Good job. Marilyn. you and Jenny

990
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:45.020
made us put the odds in my favor.

991
01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.870
- This shit's going on too long. Mav.

992
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.210
We gotta do something.

993
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.710
Get rid of this fucking bitch.

994
01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:56.120
- No doubt. no doubt. but as
long as he's putting money

995
01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120
in my bank account. I don't give a fuck.

996
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.863
- Jenny Vevo.

997
01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.973
- You mean Jenny and her giant son.

998
01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.190
Well. I'mma let you take her out

999
01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.977
and I'm gonna take his big ass out.

1000
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:18.690
The giant killer. Oh. yeah! (laughs)

1001
01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:23.834
(tense suspenseful music)

1002
01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.356
- Ah. look what I found.

1003
01:05:46.644 --> 01:05:47.477
- [Rose] Mm.

1004
01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:49.620
- It's not scotch and milk.

1005
01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:50.870
No weed. though.

1006
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:51.703
You want a swig?

1007
01:05:51.703 --> 01:05:54.667
- Mm. I want more than a swig.

1008
01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:57.417
(Becky grunting)

1009
01:05:58.897 --> 01:06:01.040
- [Becky] Nasty.

1010
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.227
- You own a bar.

1011
01:06:02.227 --> 01:06:04.260
(both laughing)

1012
01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.610
- Okay. job one. Misty.

1013
01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:07.440
job two. Needle Dick the Bug Fucker.

1014
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.490
We gotta to kill him.

1015
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.960
So when are you gonna call Charlie.

1016
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.600
ask him to switch the system?

1017
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.110
- You know it's complicated with Charlie.

1018
01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:19.650
- It's always complicated with Charlie.

1019
01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:21.240
Did you bring a remote for the explosive?

1020
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.543
- Bitch. you know I did.

1021
01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:26.313
(sighs) Becky.

1022
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.640
I'm glad we're going
through this together.

1023
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.367
- Just like old times.

1024
01:06:33.367 --> 01:06:36.367
(gentle calm music)

1025
01:06:55.586 --> 01:06:59.086
(tense suspenseful music)

1026
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:36.753
(Hank sighing)

1027
01:07:39.813 --> 01:07:42.900
- Where the fuck is this bitch?

1028
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.160
Check in with the lookout.

1029
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.383
- What's going on out
there. guys? Talk to me.

1030
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.861
- All clear.

1031
01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.630
- Goddammit. I've been
holding this shit for an hour.

1032
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.713
I am going to kill this fucking bitch.

1033
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.648
- Wait. we got a bogey.

1034
01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:03.570
- Is it here. is it the bitch?

1035
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.823
- No. it's the cops.

1036
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.090
- Give it to me.

1037
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:11.880
Stand down and let 'em in.

1038
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.030
- All right. let's do this.

1039
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:14.653
- Hey. hey. hey. in time.

1040
01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:45.680
To what do we owe the pleasure. officers?

1041
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.090
- [Jim] Wanna ask you a couple questions.

1042
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.280
- Not sure you're gonna like my answers.

1043
01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.330
Let's do this inside.

1044
01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.863
Mike. Got some new jeans. huh?

1045
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.840
Shark. all right. gentlemen.
I love a good game show.

1046
01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.680
Hit me with the questions.

1047
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.070
- So y'all know where-
- Shut the fuck up. Mike.

1048
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.820
Let's cut right to the chase. Hank.

1049
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.670
Is Rose coming here?

1050
01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:30.430
- Do I look like I keep her day planner?

1051
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:32.930
- You're holding her sister. right?

1052
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:34.933
Don't lie to me.

1053
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.690
- I don't know nothing about her sister.

1054
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:41.010
I don't know where you're
getting your information from.

1055
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:44.530
but perhaps something got
confused in the chaos.

1056
01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:47.600
I've been right here.
taking a little vacation.

1057
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.440
mourning the mistrial of my
brother at the Paradise Cove.

1058
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.050
Do you know he was. uh.
he was killed right here?

1059
01:09:55.389 --> 01:09:57.740
And because of pigs like you.

1060
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.913
that cunt got to walk away scot-free.

1061
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.690
- Because of pigs like us?

1062
01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:04.523
- Did I stutter?

1063
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.390
- You created this free-agency system.

1064
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.460
posting your murder contracts.

1065
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.470
Seems to me like you're
getting fucked your own system.

1066
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:15.593
I think they call that karma. asshole.

1067
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.113
- Karma.

1068
01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.510
- Easy.
- Take care of 'em.

1069
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:24.667
- Easy.

1070
01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:27.917
(tense sinister music)

1071
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.963
We'll let you kill Rose.

1072
01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:34.636
You can walk away.

1073
01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.513
No trial. scot-free.

1074
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.240
- You think I wanna walk away?

1075
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.030
I wanna celebrate the death of the man

1076
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:48.500
that's responsible for my brother's trial.

1077
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.460
- I did no such thing.

1078
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.390
You need to take that up with DA Jangles.

1079
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:54.433
- It's funny you mention that.

1080
01:10:54.433 --> 01:10:55.970
I already had a little conversation

1081
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:57.800
with the dickless attorney.

1082
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.410
You know what he said?
He said the same thing.

1083
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.180
He blamed you two.

1084
01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.933
Yup. even after I shot his own
mother right in front of him.

1085
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.500
he kept saying. "It's
those stupid detectives.

1086
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.887
those fucking. drunk detectives."

1087
01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.640
You remember that lead suspect
that got ran over by the car?

1088
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:20.523
The suspect.

1089
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.330
Come on. you know what
I'm talking about there.

1090
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:26.773
a DUI on the job. Jim.

1091
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.100
You fucking cops think you
can cover everything up

1092
01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.463
and nobody will notice.

1093
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:36.483
Fucking cops.

1094
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:40.770
Go ahead. Frankie.

1095
01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.550
- Mike. gun's empty. I emptied
the bullets last night.

1096
01:11:46.732 --> 01:11:48.000
- What the fuck. Frankie?

1097
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.130
- What do you mean. what the fuck?

1098
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.077
The world loses one old
grumpy drunk. that's you.

1099
01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:54.793
and I get a million bucks.

1100
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.030
You see how money solves everything?

1101
01:12:02.343 --> 01:12:04.130
Don't look at me like that.

1102
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:05.383
You fucked everything up.

1103
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.360
You had that. that stupid suspension.

1104
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.400
Then you went back to drinking again.

1105
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.023
You fucked up more cases.
You fucked up my career.

1106
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.447
Fuck you.

1107
01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:19.765
- Ow.

1108
01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:23.910
That's some heavy shit
he got off his chest.

1109
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.410
I'm gonna step out of the way.

1110
01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.293
Hashtag thoughts and prayers.

1111
01:12:34.499 --> 01:12:35.848
- You wanna do it?

1112
01:12:35.848 --> 01:12:36.681
- Do it. Frankie.
- Why don't

1113
01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:38.050
you go ahead and do it?

1114
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.923
Shoot me. you fucking pussy.

1115
01:12:40.807 --> 01:12:43.017
(roars) Do it!

1116
01:12:43.017 --> 01:12:46.190
Do it! Shoot me. you fucking pussy!

1117
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.300
(Jim yelling)
(gun bangs)

1118
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.653
- Fuck! Pshew. was that guy loud or what?

1119
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:58.600
So Frankie. you know. you had
a hand in this also you know.

1120
01:12:59.599 --> 01:13:04.150
You did. So I think it's
time that we renegotiate.

1121
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.220
- What the fuck do you mean?

1122
01:13:08.512 --> 01:13:11.050
You were gonna give me a million bucks.

1123
01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:12.570
- Whoa. slow down. Judas.

1124
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.270
We do I look like. an ATM machine?

1125
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:16.683
- Fuck you!

1126
01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.403
- Think you can take this bitch?

1127
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:26.550
- I'm sorry. sir. Which bitch?

1128
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:27.547
- [Hank] What do you mean which bitch?

1129
01:13:27.547 --> 01:13:29.448
What are you talking about?

1130
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.603
- Don't you mean Rose. Frankie.

1131
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.330
- Fuck! You cops and
your homophobic jokes.

1132
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.757
- Easy. motherfucker.

1133
01:13:38.757 --> 01:13:41.810
I'm the one holding the gun.

1134
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.410
- You keep saying that. Frankie.

1135
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.300
So what's it gonna be. deputy?

1136
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.119
- Yes. sir. Yes to both.

1137
01:13:50.119 --> 01:13:51.920
(gun bangs)

1138
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.570
- Well. I just did half your job.

1139
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:56.193
so let's move on to Rose.

1140
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.250
Heard she killed your sister.

1141
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.373
- Cousin.

1142
01:14:04.353 --> 01:14:05.213
- Your cousin?

1143
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:12.410
Hear that? Man. that must be rough.

1144
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:15.560
I know how tight y'all
hicks are with your cousins.

1145
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.900
Huh. was she tight?

1146
01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.173
I mean the relationship?

1147
01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:22.710
- I wasn't fucking my cousin. you dipshit.

1148
01:14:23.587 --> 01:14:24.687
- Watch your language.

1149
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.710
Obviously I touched a nerve.

1150
01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.360
So do you wanna kill Rose or not?

1151
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.530
- Yes. sir.

1152
01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:34.290
All right. Tell you what.

1153
01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:38.390
(tense suspenseful music)

1154
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:42.187
I'm gonna give you this big
old knife. you got that?

1155
01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:44.087
You go on out there and you kill Rose.

1156
01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:48.213
If you got a change of heart. you're dead.

1157
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.693
Dead. understood?

1158
01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.307
- Yeah. I understand. sir.

1159
01:15:00.848 --> 01:15:03.863
- Well. get a move on. C'mon. mosey.

1160
01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:08.823
Clippity clap. yipee ki
yay. whatever they say.

1161
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:12.323
Fucking cousin. Walkie.

1162
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.093
All right. listen up.

1163
01:15:16.093 --> 01:15:18.370
Barney Fife's with us. Don't shoot him.

1164
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.960
Any movement out there?

1165
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.460
- [Hitman] No. sir. all clear.

1166
01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:28.910
- All clear's over here.

1167
01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.365
(gun bangs)

1168
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.990
- [Hitman] Wait. we got a bogey.

1169
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.763
(guns banging)

1170
01:16:06.866 --> 01:16:08.827
(body thuds)

1171
01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:10.529
(blood squelches)

1172
01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:12.946
(body thuds)

1173
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.373
- Crowbar.

1174
01:16:16.373 --> 01:16:18.490
(static crackling)

1175
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:22.027
Hey. Crowbar. come in. Check it out.

1176
01:16:27.929 --> 01:16:29.846
I gotta get me a drink.

1177
01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.200
- All right. men.

1178
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.930
Rose is here somewhere.

1179
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:36.420
You two take the back of the building.

1180
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.710
You two take the front.

1181
01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:39.183
Good luck and happy hunting.

1182
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.523
Shit. Is that one of ours?

1183
01:16:46.777 --> 01:16:49.110
(car bangs)

1184
01:16:54.607 --> 01:16:56.524
Hell is this shit? Run!

1185
01:16:59.007 --> 01:16:59.988
(button beeps)

1186
01:16:59.988 --> 01:17:02.988
(upbeat rock music)

1187
01:17:05.758 --> 01:17:08.817
(explosion booming)

1188
01:17:08.817 --> 01:17:11.734
(gunfire blasting)

1189
01:17:19.628 --> 01:17:22.545
(chainsaw buzzing)

1190
01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:31.065
(gunfire blasting)

1191
01:17:42.126 --> 01:17:45.043
(chainsaw buzzing)

1192
01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:10.185
(gun banging)

1193
01:18:13.649 --> 01:18:15.982
(gun bangs)

1194
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.358
- Come on. baby. Stay with me.

1195
01:18:22.358 --> 01:18:25.120
- Siggy's is scotch. siggy's is scotch.

1196
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.540
- [Rose] No. you're bleeding bad. baby.

1197
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.073
You okay? Look at me. look at me.

1198
01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.040
- You go kill that motherfucker.

1199
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.356
- Becky.

1200
01:18:38.356 --> 01:18:39.330
(Becky choking)
Oh no!

1201
01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:42.476
No. you stay with me! Okay?

1202
01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:43.309
Look in my eyes!

1203
01:18:44.434 --> 01:18:45.383
- Rose. Oh. Rose.

1204
01:18:50.657 --> 01:18:51.657
- No! Becky!

1205
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:55.810
- Goddamn. you cost me ammunition. Rose.

1206
01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:58.003
I was hoping for one bullet. two bitches.

1207
01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:02.710
How about I let you live
a little bit longer?

1208
01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:05.553
You can stew on that. (laughs)

1209
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:12.930
- Rose. you killed my
husband. you fucking bitch.

1210
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:15.603
I'm here to kill you. This is personal.

1211
01:19:16.587 --> 01:19:18.438
(blows thudding)

1212
01:19:18.438 --> 01:19:19.271
- Stop.

1213
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.083
Don't fucking move.

1214
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:24.453
Now what we gonna do.

1215
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.533
we gonna do shit nice and smooth. Rose.

1216
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:37.068
Now if I wanted her dead.
she'd be dead already.

1217
01:19:37.068 --> 01:19:38.368
I want you to take her gun

1218
01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:42.188
and put a bullet in this bitch's temple.

1219
01:19:42.188 --> 01:19:43.420
- No!

1220
01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.860
- Relax. I got this.

1221
01:19:47.025 --> 01:19:51.608
(gun bangs)
(Al yells)

1222
01:19:54.965 --> 01:19:57.260
(gun banging)

1223
01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.260
(Marilyn screaming)

1224
01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:05.104
- Rose! Kill me!

1225
01:20:06.904 --> 01:20:08.880
(gun bangs)
- Hello. Rose!

1226
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.023
Look up here. Hi.

1227
01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.477
So you want your sister
alive and I want you dead.

1228
01:20:17.477 --> 01:20:19.650
How about we make a trade. huh?

1229
01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.430
On the count of five.

1230
01:20:23.774 --> 01:20:26.783
one. two.

1231
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:34.313
three. 1.000. four.

1232
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.173
Mississippi.

1233
01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.413
going once. going twice.
(gun bangs)

1234
01:20:41.413 --> 01:20:42.831
- Misty!
(gun banging)

1235
01:20:42.831 --> 01:20:45.743
- [Hank] I'm not gonna hurt you.

1236
01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:47.721
(Rose grunting)

1237
01:20:47.721 --> 01:20:50.971
(tense sinister music)

1238
01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.483
- Goddamn. you are a
pussy with nine lives.

1239
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.568
Tell you what I'm thinking.

1240
01:21:30.568 --> 01:21:31.401
(gun bangs)
(Hank yells)

1241
01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:32.270
Oh. fuck. ow!

1242
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:33.680
Oh. not the shoes. not the shoes.

1243
01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.835
ow. hey. hey. hey. hey.
listen to my offer.

1244
01:21:35.835 --> 01:21:37.485
(gun clicks)
Listen to my offer.

1245
01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:40.540
(gun bangs)

1246
01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:41.543
That's my offer.

1247
01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.790
- Rose. Rose. Rose.

1248
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.093
Why can't you just fucking die already?

1249
01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:58.320
- Fuck.

1250
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.253
- Oh. don't act so surprised. Rose.

1251
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:02.580
- Shit happens.

1252
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.640
- Fuck you.

1253
01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.473
- Fuck you. you were-

1254
01:22:04.473 --> 01:22:05.960
- Fuck both of you.

1255
01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.790
- Sorry. sis. Five
million is a lot of money.

1256
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:10.890
I couldn't pass it up.

1257
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.360
You're gonna die by one of
these hitters soon anyway.

1258
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.943
Why can't I benefit from that?

1259
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.544
- Can't argue with that.

1260
01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:22.812
It's good business.

1261
01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:24.490
- You're a fucking idiot. Misty.

1262
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:27.513
He was offering everyone
12 million to kill me.

1263
01:22:29.755 --> 01:22:32.130
- Is that true? You fucking asshole!

1264
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.320
- Whoa. whoa. hey. hey. hey!

1265
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320
She's fucking lying.

1266
01:22:36.082 --> 01:22:38.053
- And you believed him.

1267
01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.820
You fucking druggy whore.

1268
01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.970
Why do you think all
those hitters are out?

1269
01:22:43.983 --> 01:22:45.310
- That Was my fucking money!

1270
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.140
I let you cum in me. too.

1271
01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.300
you fucking. lying bastard.

1272
01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.110
- Put the gun down. bitch.

1273
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:53.050
Come on. She's lying.

1274
01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:54.260
Just look at the app. huh?

1275
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.230
Whoa. just checking the app.

1276
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.130
Look. she's back down to five million.

1277
01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:03.890
What the fuck?

1278
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:04.867
- What do you mean what the fuck?

1279
01:23:04.867 --> 01:23:06.982
(phone beeping)

1280
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:07.815
- Nothing. it's a glitch.

1281
01:23:07.815 --> 01:23:09.540
- What kind of glitch. Hank?

1282
01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.453
What does the fucking system say?

1283
01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:14.460
- What the fuck did you do. Rose?

1284
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:17.730
- Hey. Charlie.

1285
01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:20.643
Yeah. add my sister to the list.

1286
01:23:21.594 --> 01:23:23.744
- What the fuck is she
talking about. Hank?

1287
01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.250
- Yeah. I'm sure. Thanks. babe.

1288
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:30.480
- What is she talking about? Hello?

1289
01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.853
- Nothing. all right?
It's fucking Charlie.

1290
01:23:34.445 --> 01:23:36.576
- (laughs) Yeah. Hank.

1291
01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:38.626
Why don't you tell her who's on the list?

1292
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.430
- The guy that designed the app.

1293
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:44.700
he hacked in. he added me
in as a kill. all right?

1294
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.900
It's not gonna pay out.

1295
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.860
It's a hack. It's not real.

1296
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.180
It's not gonna pay out.

1297
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.310
- He said no one could do that.

1298
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:52.870
- No one but the fat guy in a wheelchair

1299
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:54.090
that designed the app.

1300
01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:55.740
Yeah. he hacked it. hon.

1301
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.500
- How much are you worth?

1302
01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.870
- No. there's nothing there.

1303
01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.860
It keeps glitching. It keeps changing.

1304
01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.630
- No. it's not a fucking
glitch. He's lying.

1305
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:05.223
- Shut the fuck up. Rose. Hank?

1306
01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:09.173
- Honey. why would I fucking lie to you?

1307
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:13.763
It's not real.

1308
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:17.420
I'm telling you. honey.

1309
01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.550
- Oh. your fucking liar!
- Honey. please. no!

1310
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:22.050
(gun banging)

1311
01:24:23.509 --> 01:24:27.092
(tense suspenseful music)

1312
01:24:36.877 --> 01:24:38.180
- You should have killed me.

1313
01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.220
- Fuck you. Rose!

1314
01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.490
- What's the matter?

1315
01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:43.990
- Why don't you ask your
fucking hacker boyfriend?

1316
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:48.393
You're gonna shoot me. collect the bounty?

1317
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:54.240
- No. I don't have any bullets left.

1318
01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.700
I just want to look at your face

1319
01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.173
now that you're on the list.

1320
01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.970
Becky and a lot of good people
are dead because of you.

1321
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:03.720
- Because of me. Rose?

1322
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.960
No. they're dead because of you and him.

1323
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.183
- You were safe.

1324
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:12.363
- Take me off this list. goddammit.

1325
01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.180
- Look at all the hitters
who are out there now.

1326
01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.623
They're looking for you.
Don't you feel special?

1327
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:20.833
- Fuck!

1328
01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.370
What am I supposed to do?

1329
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:25.203
- I would run.

1330
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:28.183
- Run?

1331
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:34.097
No. I'm gonna offer your hack some money.

1332
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.910
- Don't move. bitch.

1333
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:38.773
Don't even fucking breathe hard.

1334
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.177
Fuck. Hank.

1335
01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.110
Looks like I'm in charge now.

1336
01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.400
- Hank's dead. but don't worry. asshole.

1337
01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.600
You're on the list. too.

1338
01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.931
- You just shut the fuck up.

1339
01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:52.890
If I wanted you to open
your fucking mouth.

1340
01:25:52.890 --> 01:25:55.050
I'd unzip my pants.

1341
01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:56.900
Now put your hands over your fucking-

1342
01:26:03.787 --> 01:26:06.120
(gun bangs)

1343
01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:33.460
- Even though it would have
been great killing you. Rose.

1344
01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.960
truth is I'm only in
this shit for the money.

1345
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.290
- Hey. you going back to the city?

1346
01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:48.123
- Yeah.

1347
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:51.560
- Can I get a lift to the county line?

1348
01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.393
- Sure.

1349
01:27:13.859 --> 01:27:16.192
- And finally. we have Rose.

1350
01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.490
My former boss. Hank. screwed
the pooch underestimating her.

1351
01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:24.173
Took her for granted.
look what happened to him.

1352
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.903
At least they got his car out of it.

1353
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.660
Rose is an asset. not a target.

1354
01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.393
Just look. Onto her next job already.

1355
01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:42.290
She lost her best friend and
the only family she's got.

1356
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.333
not blinking an eye.

1357
01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.878
Not sure what's gonna
happen to this woman.

1358
01:27:46.878 --> 01:27:48.209
The app needs more like her.

1359
01:27:48.209 --> 01:27:51.209
(upbeat rock music)

1360
01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:00.880
So as you can see. the test
went better than expected.

1361
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.210
1.5 million on the Battery App.

1362
01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.060
1.8 million on the Kidnap App.

1363
01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.450
but as I said before. our
bread and butter. murder.

1364
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:13.730
Gross 12.5. we're going
all in on The Kill App

1365
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:15.040
and dumping the rest.

1366
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.010
Now imagine a world
where you have a neighbor

1367
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:20.580
who lives down the street.
constantly pissing you off

1368
01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.910
throwing loud parties.
or someone cuts you off

1369
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:26.110
on the street. or better yet.

1370
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:28.270
a coworker gets your promotion.

1371
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.710
Huh. maybe you just don't like someone.

1372
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:33.130
Hm. with the Kill App. you can just put

1373
01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:35.520
a price on that person's head.

1374
01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.440
And then any Tom. Dick. or
Sally out of work can log in.

1375
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.453
check who's available in
the area. and go cash in.

1376
01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.913
We tested this for a year
in just one small town.

1377
01:28:48.768 --> 01:28:53.420
So imagine it statewide. going national.

1378
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.053
but better yet. globally.

1379
01:29:05.710 --> 01:29:06.757
- Where do I sign?

1380
01:29:08.211 --> 01:29:11.211
(upbeat rock music)

1381
01:30:07.253 --> 01:30:11.086
(upbeat rock music continues)
