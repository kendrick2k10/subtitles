was current.

And as I looked at those
candles

78
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.917
of that birthday cake.
it brought me back

79
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.335
to the big moments of her life.

80
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.713

to all she's seen
in her young life.

85
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.473
Terror reaching our shores.

86
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:30.562

A great recession.

87
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.105

-SUPPORTER 1: Yes!
-And the sad truth

93
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.578
is one party fuels this rage
while the other sits

94
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.912

and whines about it.

The good news is...

98
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.672
my daughter Alison
turned 21 yesterday.

those candles on top
of that cake.

102
00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.095
a funny thing happened.

103
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.972
The flames reignited.

104
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.475
So. she blew 'em out again.

105
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.684
And then the flames came back
again.

106
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.353
And no matter
how hard she tried.

107
00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.729
she couldn't blow
those candles out.

108
00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.523
And that made me think
two things.

109
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.152
One. my wife
has a wonderful sense of humor.

110
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.112
-And two.
-[crowd laughing]

111
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.908

[crowd cheering]

114
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.955
And we have to dig deep
and do it again.

115
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:35.168
Because Alison deserves better.
Our young people deserve better.

116
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.462
They deserve to look forward
to the future

117
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.549
the way we used to. with hope.
with pride. with excitement.

118
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.843
There's no more time
for cruelty or fear.

119
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.055
There's no more time
for incompetence or inaction.

Their time is up!
Our time is now!

And if you stand with me.

124
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.024
and you vote for me.
and you keep fighting

125
00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.734
for real change with me.

126
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:04.739

our fire back. too.

128
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.917
Now. let me tell you
how we're gonna do it.

ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
The general election
is finally upon us.

130
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.432
And once again. we're forced
to choose

131
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.934
between the lesser of two evils.

132
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.020
On one side.
a Democrat in decline.

133
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.563
and on the other.

134
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.441
a Republican in the pockets
of corporate America.

135
00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.069
Oh. boy. our country is mired
in a recession.

136
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.864
the whole world's on fire.
and these are the best

137
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.033
two people we can come up with?
I mean. come on!

138
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.785
Good luck. everyone.
We're going to need it.

Good news!

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.081
We've been bought again.

141
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.459
As I'm sure. some of you
have already heard.

142
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.587
Mr. Jack Hampton
is our newest overlord.

143
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.923
Of course. I'm gonna try
to minimize the casualties.

144
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.508
but it's no secret.

145
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.220
our readership
is. uh. spreading thin.

146
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.223
If we hope to compete.
we're gonna have to get down

147
00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.476
in the mud with the pigs.

148
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.520
And how low does Mr. Hampton
want us to go?

149
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.606
Conspiracy clickbait?

150
00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.067
Ten thousand words
on celebrity pets?

151
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.736
We have to evolve.

152
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.279
The only reason
we're not worm feed

153
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.115
like half the other papers
in this godforsaken country

154
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.826
is because we do not stop
to tread water.

155
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.080
If we don't keep swimmin'.
we die.

156
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.164
You.

157
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.958
I'm looking for new.
innovative ideas.

158
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.545
Something that will ensure
that we are all still employed

159
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.130
come Labor Day. Hmm?

160
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.800
We need to win the battle
for Millenials and Gen Z.

161
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.302
-Uh-huh.
-We-- we program
around the Facebook algorithm.

162
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:51.054
Expand
our social media presence.

163
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.098
He. whose name I don't care

164
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.767
to learn. seems to think
that because I've got grandkids

165
00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.269
born before the Internet.
I don't know

166
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.522
that we need to expand.
Of course.

167
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.900
I have got a whole
fucking sweatshop

168
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.695
working like a Russian
troll farm to expand

169
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.988
our social media presence.
Okay?

170
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.241
I've also got an army
of halfwits

171
00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.659
twice as smart as you--

172
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.077
A high school in West Virginia

173
00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.912
is going
to a four-day school week.

174
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.163
because of budget cuts.

175
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.581
I had a call
with the principal--

176
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.583
And how's that gonna sell
papers?

177
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.002
I thought--

178
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.629
I mean. cutting a whole day
out of the school week--

179
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.964
What percentage

180
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.842
of our readership do you think
has ever set foot

181
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.176
in West Virginia?

182
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.971
And as for the banjo-pickers
themselves.

183
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:37.017
if it ain't Fox or Infowars.
they ain't readin' it.

184
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.102
Well. maybe that's why
they don't read the Chronicle.

185
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.270
They got a point
calling themselves

186
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.647
the forgotten people
and calling us

187
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.733
condescending coastal elitists.

188
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.864
We are elite.

189
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.323
And if you don't start
acting like it.

190
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.576
you're gonna be a forgotten
person before you know it.

191
00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.996
The school in question
is 90 percent minority.

192
00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.874
It's gonna make
the achievement gap even wider.

193
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.334
Of course.
the private school kids

194
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.085
-are gonna be just fine.
-GORDON: What else?

195
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.796
Hmm?

196
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.341
Nate Sterling.

197
00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.718
Ah. You again.

198
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.928
I hear he's jumping
into the race next week.

199
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.097
And you think
I haven't heard those rumors?

200
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.099
It's bullshit.
It's publicity for his book.

201
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.642
My source on the ground says

202
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.354
he just hired Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

203
00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.903
Independents. They're like bees.

204
00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.072
Once they sting. they die.

205
00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.116
If he does announce.
he might buzz around

206
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.702
the honey jar for a week or
two.
but nobody outside

207
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.245
the two-party system
has ever cracked

208
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.705
20 percent of the poles.

209
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:41.873
Now. it'd be a fool's errand.

210
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.917
His camp secretly hired

211
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.212
a pollster to test his numbers
against potential nominees.

212
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.006
When Turnbull secured the bid.
they saw a real opening

213
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.132
for an independent like him.

214
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:52.717
They know he's gonna have to
thread the needle.

215
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.636
but it's not impossible.

216
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:57.806
So. what are you suggesting?

217
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.769
We get in early.

218
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.145
Prep a cover feature.

219
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.939
The wave is coming
with this guy.

220
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.691
We may as well paddle out
to the break.

221
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.111
Tell me why I would waste
my front page on this neophyte?

222
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.823
Are you referring to me
or Sterling. sir?

223
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.366
GORDON:
Both.

224
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:19.703
You willing to bet your job
on this fever dream of yours?

225
00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.122
If we short him. we'll be
kicking ourselves later.

226
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.957
But if we're early to the
party.
we might just sell

227
00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.291
enough papers
to give the Russian trolls

228
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.085
an extra ten minutes
on their lunch break.

229
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.130
[breathes deeply]

230
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.131
Hmm.

231
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.216
[clicks tongue]

232
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.051
Fuck it.

233
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.679
How can I fold
when a wounded cub is all in?

234
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.142
Ackerman. you take the reins
on the Sterling feature.

235
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.435
Choose your own co-pilot.

236
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.686
I'll take Conrad.

237
00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.863
So. you're gonna give me
the source of Sterling's camp?

238
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.700
Look. look. look. look.
I get it. I get it. All right?

239
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.995
You wanted that story.
And that was a valiant effort.

240
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.915
It was. But. you know.
karma is still a bitch.

241
00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.751
-And so am I.
-[chuckles]

242
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.085
Come on. Look.

243
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.795
It's a hard time for guys
like me right now.

244
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:11.421
I mean. look around you.

245
00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:12.714
Oh. come on.

246
00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.465
A little awareness maybe--

247
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.966
Okay. Thanks.

248
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.093
Make up your mind.

249
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:20.180
Either you're a victim
or a big shot.

250
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.183
Kid gets to scoop Ackerman's
shit on his first cover story.

251
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.810
And suddenly.
he's schizophrenic.

252
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:26.895
[chuckles]
No. I was just--

253
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.105
Were you just thanking Eli
for the opportunity?

254
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.192
Yeah.

255
00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.240
I never liked that arrogant
little boat shoe.

256
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:45.330
Email me the best thing
you've ever written.

257
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.381
Which piece did you send him?

258
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.383
The Honduran refugee one?

259
00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.968
-Yeah.
-Holy shit. He is gonna love it.

260
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.430
What?

261
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.431
Nothing.

262
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.354
What is this?

263
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.192
Now. when did you have time to--

264
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.569
You've been working so hard.
I thought.

265
00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.239
"He deserves the finest grape
Safeway has on offer."

266
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.782
Mm. [does chef's kiss]

267
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.409
[chuckles]

268
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.250
Penny ships off tomorrow.

269
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.003
So. if my mom breaks down
in tears. don't be too alarmed.

270
00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.462
LUCAS:
Your mom? What about you?

271
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.213
Remember the last time
she deployed?

272
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.423
[Eli chuckles]

273
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.257
ELI:
That's smart. buddy.

274
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.259
LUCAS:
Ooh!

275
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.468
-ELI: Hi.
-Hello.

276
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.386
LUCAS:
Hey.

277
00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.848
To my beautiful daughters.

278
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.433
Penelope and Elisha.

279
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.102
One makes the news
and one reports it.

280
00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.311
[chuckles]

281
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.356
Oh. wow.
You make it sound so romantic.

282
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.608
Most days. I just stand
by the printer

283
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.402
and get paper cuts.

284
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.446
Well. you accepted the risk
when you signed up for the job.

285
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.488
ELI:
Why don't you just go AWOL.

286
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.990
and come bunk up with me
and Lucas?

287
00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.283
PENNY:
That'd be fun.

288
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.451
As long as you're cool
with harboring a deserter

289
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:05.952
with a warrant
out for her arrest.

290
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.454
Let's change the subject.
shall we?

291
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:10.165
-Eli has some breaking news.
-Oh.

292
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.917
She managed to get on the radar
of one Nicholas Booker.

293
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.919
Nicholas Booker. huh?

294
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.421
See. now that's what you need.

295
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.964
Your own opinion column.

296
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.592
I'm not on the Daily Tar Heel
anymore. dad.

297
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.136
Columns don't just drop out
of thin air at the Chronicle.

298
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.472
Well. you wanna have a real
impact.

299
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.308
Change minds. You need a pulpit.

300
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.895
A column in the Chronicle
is like the pope's balcony

301
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.563
-for Christ's sake.
-I'm working on it. daddy.

302
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:36.149
I'm just saying it might take
a couple decades. That's all.

303
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:40.028
The Dalai Lama was a god-king
at 2.

304
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.279
LUCAS:
Man has a point.

305
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.573
-Oh. yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

306
00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.367
Mm. Wow.

307
00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.243
Does the man know
that religion and politics

308
00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.620
are about the only two topics
to avoid

309
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.913
when you got a dinner guest?

310
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.664
HAL:
Who. Lucas?

311
00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.333
He's practically family.

312
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.211
Speaking of. when are you two
gonna make that official?

313
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.046
[chuckles]

314
00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.006
LUCAS:
Have you got any new additions
to your collection?

315
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.092
-No. but wait. When are we gonna
make it official?
-No. no. no. This is important.

316
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.510
-[laughs]
-Right.

317
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.894
You know. I never asked you.
which one was your first?

318
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.647
HAL:
The day we realized

319
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:19.109
the government had been lying
to us all along.

320
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.653
sending me and my friends
halfway around the world

321
00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.446
to kill and be killed.

322
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:27.117
Years after. Nixon knew the war
was unwinnable.

323
00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.410
LUCAS:
Do you have a favorite?

324
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.495
He did before it was retracted.

325
00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.372
HAL:
That's what happens
when you play fast.

326
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:33.915
I wasn't playing. dad.

327
00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.459
He played me.
There's a difference.

328
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.045
Sweetheart.
you let yourself get played.

329
00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.714
Why don't you all come in here.

330
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.590
so we can give Penny
a proper send-off?

331
00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.436
[indistinct chatter]

332
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.229
RECEPTIONIST:
He's in meetings all day.
but I can give you his card.

333
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.147
ELI:
Thanks.

334
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.566
Oh. there he goes right now.

335
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:00.984
That'll be on Saturday's draw.

336
00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.152
Thank you. Sharon.

337
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.196
ELI:
Mr. Mayfield.

338
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.407
Eli James. Washington Chronicle.

339
00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.075
You're the one
who keeps calling.

340
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.243
I'm doing a story

341
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.619
on drastic cuts
in public school budgets.

342
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.163
-and it's my understanding
that--
-I'm sorry.

343
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.289
I'm late for a meeting.

344
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.297
Our boys looked good this year.

345
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.631
We play like we did
against the Tar Heels

346
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:25.633
in the ACC final. we might
really have a shot next year.

347
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.177
You're a Blue Devil?

348
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.179
Yes. sir. Class of '08.

349
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.223
Ah. Well. I got a few decades
on you as you can...

350
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.059
Bowties never go out of fashion.

351
00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.644
Listen. I gotta ask.

352
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.730
how has the recession
affected your jackpots?

353
00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.357
Oh. as it affected all of us.

354
00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:41.358
The numbers might have dipped
but--

355
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.609
Well. I would have thought that

356
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.694
jackpots would rise in the
recession.

357
00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:45.945
How's that?

358
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.156
You know. a lot
more desperate daydreamers.

359
00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:52.660
I think you mean grown adults
and valued customers.

360
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.790
You should go grab a ticket
yourself.

361
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.625
Gotta be in it to win it.

8:00 p.m. tonight at The Monaco.

365
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.272
If you're not early.
you're late.

366
00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.483
[indistinct chatter]

367
00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.040
I don't have time
for pleasantries.

368
00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:41.084
I've got a hit on CNN
at 10:00 p.m.

369
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.254
What are you staring at?

370
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.090
I'm sorry. I just have read
every single one of your columns

371
00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.217
-since I was in seventh grade--
-I don't need idol worship.

372
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.137
I need something else from you.
Sit down.

373
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.184
I'm getting out.

374
00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.311
As soon as this election's
over. I'm turning in my quill.

375
00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.438
and moving to the country.

376
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:04.274
What? No. you can't retire yet.

377
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.567
Who are you. my accountant?

378
00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:07.068
Well. what good are you gonna
do
out in retirement?

379
00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:08.403
I'll bury myself in Bourbon.

380
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.321
I can read fiction for a change.

381
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.407
And I might even watch golf
on Sundays.

382
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:13.742
Institutions are crumbling.

383
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.535
Okay? Reality is under attack.

384
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:18.288
You're one of the only voices
whCome on. Come on.--

385
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.458
Tweets with cats boxing yarn
get more eyeballs

386
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.460
than a column these days.

387
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.086
I've had a good run.

388
00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:28.256
But what journalism's become.
I'm done with it.

389
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.718
There's a reason they tell you
not to meet your heroes.

390
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.428
Then why did you invite me here?

391
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.263
ENRIQUE:
Mr. Booker!

392
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.306

Ah! Can't complain. Enrique.

Isn't that your job. sir?

395

Best steak in town.

396
00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.730
Only reason I allow him

397
00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:44.856

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.316

Bring us two rib-eye.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.163

And that's the last time
I'm doing it for you.

408
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.632
Excuse me. Enrique?

409
00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.177
Give me the house salad.

410
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.430
And the lobster tail.

411
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:18.807
And may I?

412
00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:25.146
A bottle of the '04 Chablis.
Feels like a good vintage.

00:22:59.504 --> 00:23:01.631
to stand up to China.

528
00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:04.884
I mean. we've got ten times
the military spending of Russia.

529
00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:07.095
and yet he cowers in the face
of the Kremlin.

530
00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:09.514
Look.
he's just a weak president.

531
00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:11.516
I'm just gonna--
I won't say it.

532
00:23:11.558 --> 00:23:14.602
Republicans know it.
our allies. and we all know it.

533
00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:15.437
And let's be honest.
the Democrats know it. too.

534
00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:16.980
[hums]

535
00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.606
What are you so giddy about?

536
00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:19.983
-Wouldn't you like to know?
-LUCAS: Oh!

537
00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:21.735
[Lucas chuckles]

538
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.945
[hums]

539
00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:25.113
LUCAS:
How'd it go?

540
00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.076
[chuckles]

541
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.747
[hums]

542
00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:35.123
-LUCAS: No.
-Oh. yeah. It's coming down.

543
00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:37.125
LUCAS: Get outta here.
It's coming down.

544
00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:38.001
LUCAS:
No.

545
00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.502
[chuckles]

546
00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:40.712
-Go away.
-[kisses]

547
00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:42.088
-ELI: I got you something.
-Oh. yeah?

548
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.508
It's probably worth $44 million.

549
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.593
My own private island.

550
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.928
so I can have some peace
and quiet?

551
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.599
Aw! Where's yours?
You didn't get one for yourself?

552
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.935
I already won the lottery.
because I have you.

553
00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:58.146
How come you're never this
sweet
to me when you're sober?

554
00:23:58.188 --> 00:24:00.940
Koalas are sweet.

555
00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:02.567
I am a lion.

556
00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.277
-Oh. is that right?
-A lion.

557
00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:06.029
-Oh?
-A hungry lion.

558
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:08.239
Oh. [chuckles]

559
00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.532
-[smooches]
-Very hungry.

560
00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:10.700
Oh.

561
00:24:10.742 --> 00:24:12.535
Very hungry.

562
00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:15.789
CORRESPONDENT 4 (ON TV):
Breaking news
out of the Washington Chronicle.

563
00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:18.500
Olympic gold medalist
and best-selling author.

564
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:21.211
Nate Sterling is set to launch
an independent campaign

565
00:24:22.337 --> 00:24:23.588
for president next Sunday
in his hometown

566
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.048
of Portsmouth. Ohio.

567
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.008
The reporting
out of the Washington Chronicle

568
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.803
claims that Sterling has hired
the highly sought-after

569
00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:32.681
Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

570
00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:35.684
While history tells us
that an independent bid faces--

571
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.060
The Chronicle?

572
00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:39.896
Oh. Eli. what the fuck?

573
00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:41.940
Come on. Everybody knew he was
running.

574
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.233
It was like the worst-kept
secret.

575
00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:45.902
Kathy Gibbs. Nobody knew about
Kathy Gibbs. Eli.

576
00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:47.529
ELI:
I have other sources.

577
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.031
I wouldn't have pitched it
if I hadn't double-checked--

578
00:24:50.073 --> 00:24:52.075
Am I your source
or am I your boyfriend?

579
00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:53.993
You never said
it was off the record.

580
00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:55.120
You can't be serious.

581
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:56.913
Sorry. Lucas. I really am.

582
00:24:56.955 --> 00:25:00.083
I just-- it just came out.
I-- I didn't even plan on it.

583
00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:03.169
And then it was out. I just...

584
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:05.755
Oh. fuck. fuck. fuck.

585
00:25:05.797 --> 00:25:08.758
Fuck. fuck.
Who are you calling?

586
00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:10.927
Eli.

587
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:12.303
Senator Turnbull. please.

588
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:13.972
What?

589
00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:16.975
Eli James
from the Washington Chronicle.

590
00:25:17.017 --> 00:25:20.645
Senator Turnbull.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

591
00:25:20.687 --> 00:25:22.814
I was just wondering
if you had any thoughts

592
00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:25.692
on Nate Sterling
entering the race.

593
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:28.028
Right now?

594
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.781
Uh. yeah. Of course.

595
00:25:31.823 --> 00:25:33.033
I'll be right there.

596
00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.702
Eli. What the fuck?

597
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:41.166
I just got an interview
with Patricia Turnbull.

598
00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:42.876
Now?

599
00:25:42.917 --> 00:25:44.794
Are you serious? You're drunk!

600
00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:47.672
Buzzed. And I wouldn't have
this interview

601
00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:50.050
if it wasn't for you.
so thank you so much.

602
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:50.967
I love you.

603
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:52.385
-[smooches]
-Wait.

604
00:25:52.427 --> 00:25:54.220
-Cold shower now.
-I don't have time.

605
00:25:54.262 --> 00:25:57.182
No. now! Give me the keys.

606
00:25:58.892 --> 00:26:00.643
Do not go easy on her. okay?

607
00:26:01.686 --> 00:26:02.771
Okay.

608
00:26:04.689 --> 00:26:05.815
Here.

609
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:08.902
-Listen to me.
-Yes.

610
00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:10.153
Anything you have seen.

611
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:11.780
heard. or read
under this roof...

612
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:13.406
-ELI: Mm-hmm.
-Is of the fucking record...

613
00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:16.201
-Yeah. yeah.
-Okay?
Especially in Turnbull's office.

614
00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:17.827
-Yeah.
-Eli!

615
00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:18.953
Scout's honor.

616
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:20.080
Yeah. Scout's--

617
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:20.872
[smooches]

618
00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:25.752
Just global response.
No. we don't go for that.

619
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:27.712
ELI:
Eli James for Senator Turnbull.

620
00:26:27.754 --> 00:26:29.339
RECEPTIONIST 2:
Please sign in.

621
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:30.924
She's expecting you.

622
00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:32.175
TURNBULL:
Come on in. hon!

623
00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:34.678
Where is...

624
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:37.847
ELI:
Evening. Senator.

625
00:26:37.889 --> 00:26:39.099
Good evening!

626
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.768
I noticed a Tom Mayfield
on your sign-in log.

627
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.354
Is that the same Mayfield
from SuperMillions?

628
00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:45.397
You know Tom?

629
00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:47.023
ELI:
I'm writing a story on lotto.

630
00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.066
TURNBULL:
Oh. dear.

631
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:50.110
That sounds like a real
tour de force.

632
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:51.820
How do you know Mr. Mayfield?

633
00:26:53.822 --> 00:26:55.323
TURNBULL:
You see the one in the bowtie?

634
00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:57.283
ELI:
Oh. my God. Is that you? Wow.

635
00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:58.827
He thinks because we dated

636
00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:00.995
30 years ago.
he can drop by unannounced

637
00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:03.123
with all kinds of suggestions.

638
00:27:03.164 --> 00:27:04.416
[laughs]

639
00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.959
I love this town.

640
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:08.378
It'll even turn ex-boyfriends
into lobbyists.

641
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.921
ELI:
Hmm.

642
00:27:13.842 --> 00:27:15.176
What is your reaction
to Nate Sterling

643
00:27:15.218 --> 00:27:16.344
entering the race?

644
00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.139
I look forward to a healthy.

645
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.018
robust debate on the future
of our great nation.

646
00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:25.770
I'm not too familiar
with Mr. Sterling personally.

647
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:28.314
but anyone who aspires
to serve his or her country.

648
00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:31.860
whether it's an Olympian.
or a lieutenant. or a president.

649
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:35.030
it is okay by me.
Off the record?

650
00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:39.451
Mr. Sterling is swimming
with sharks.

651
00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:41.161
and he can't afford a cage.

652
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:48.501
How would you describe

653
00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:51.171
your relationship
with Harvey Altman?

654
00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:54.174
Harvey was my senior advisor
for many years.

655
00:27:54.215 --> 00:27:55.467
Isn't it odd

656
00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:58.386
that your most trusted advisor
splits to found

657
00:27:58.428 --> 00:28:00.764
UpRight Super PAC
just a few weeks

658
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.223
before you announce
your candidacy?

659
00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:03.183
What's odd about it?

660
00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:05.226
Well. UpRight is raking in

661
00:28:05.268 --> 00:28:07.771
loads of cash
from high-dollar donors.

662
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:08.938
As is their legal right.

663
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.190
Thanks to your bill.

664
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:12.150
My bill gives Americans

665
00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:14.069
the freedom to do
what they please

666
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.236
with their hard-earned money.

667
00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:17.197
You seem very fond of that word.
"Freedom."

668
00:28:17.238 --> 00:28:18.239
Oh. yes. I am.

669
00:28:19.074 --> 00:28:20.200
It's what this country
was built on.

670
00:28:20.241 --> 00:28:21.785
For some.

671
00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:22.827
Hmm.

672
00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:25.497
There are reports that Upright

673
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:29.167
has raised upwards of
$80 million in just four months.

674
00:28:29.209 --> 00:28:30.960
-And?
-Won't that give the rich

675
00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:33.755
an outsized influence
in a Turnbull administration?

676
00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:37.008
Oh. hon. You talk about the rich
as if they're inhuman.

677
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.010
I started my company
40 years ago

678
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:42.806
with one truck
and a whole lot of elbow grease.

679
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:45.475
Surely. the American dream
don't make me a bad person.

680
00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:48.436
I see that same fire
in your eyes right now.

681
00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:50.480
You didn't answer my question.
Senator.

682
00:28:52.273 --> 00:28:53.483
Listen. Eli.

683
00:28:56.236 --> 00:28:59.572
Five million from a fat wallet
and a searing column

684
00:28:59.614 --> 00:29:02.826
from Nicholas Booker
are one in the same.

685
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:05.203
Both might get me off
on a good day.

686
00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:08.206
But if you think they so much
as sway my stance

687
00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:11.126
on the renaming of a post
office

688
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:13.294
in Wasilla. Alaska.

689
00:29:13.336 --> 00:29:15.213
then you haven't done
your homework.

690
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:19.426
Why did you invite me
here tonight?

691
00:29:19.467 --> 00:29:21.886
[chuckles] Oh. honey. Relax.

692
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:23.972
This ain't the principal's
office.

693
00:29:24.014 --> 00:29:25.515
You're here.
because if there's one thing

694
00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:27.892
I've learned over two decades
in these chambers.

695
00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:30.103
it's to keep your friends close.

696
00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:33.273
And seeing as you'll be helping
with the most widely-read

697
00:29:33.314 --> 00:29:36.484
op-ed column in this country.
I figured we might get to know

698
00:29:36.526 --> 00:29:37.819
one another.

699
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:44.075
Nick is a cheapskate.
I tip Enrique way better.

700
00:29:47.328 --> 00:29:49.539
[indistinct chatter]

701
00:29:49.581 --> 00:29:58.506

704
00:30:32.957 --> 00:30:33.667
[door knocking]

705
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:35.335
Mm-hmm.

706
00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:37.003
Nick. can I ask you something?

707
00:30:38.546 --> 00:30:41.257
There's something gnawing at me
with this whole lotto.

708
00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:42.634
What about my column?

709
00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:45.387
ELI:
Wrote up my notes last night.

710
00:30:46.638 --> 00:30:48.014
You were drunk last night.

711
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:49.140
ELI:
Just hear me out.

712
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.435
Lotto jackpots increase
during recessions.

713
00:30:52.477 --> 00:30:56.272
They have for every economic
downturn as far back

714
00:30:56.314 --> 00:30:57.357
as the data goes.

715
00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:58.525
And why should I care?

716
00:30:58.566 --> 00:31:01.027
Because not this time.

717
00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:03.446
Since the recession hit.
SuperMillions' jackpots

718
00:31:03.488 --> 00:31:05.657
have fallen
close to five percent.

719
00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:07.992
-Tragic.
-It's a complete 180.

720
00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:10.578
A behavioral impossibility.

721
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.039
Human nature
doesn't just reverse itself.

722
00:31:13.081 --> 00:31:15.458
And SuperMillions
is the only lottery

723
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.960
that's had that kind
of inversion.

724
00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.546
Wherever you're going with
this.
get there faster.

725
00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:21.214
Public schools that rely

726
00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:23.216
on that money
are getting stiffed.

727
00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:25.719
So. where is the missing money
going?

728
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.554
NICK:
This better be good.

729
00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:32.017
The director of SuperMillions
is a guy named Tom Mayfield.

730
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:36.271
Duke alum. Class of '82.
Senator Turnbull's alma mater.

731
00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:37.564
They dated in college.

732
00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:42.027
I hope you're not suggesting
what I think you're suggesting.

733
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:43.194
ELI:
The same accounting firm.

734
00:31:43.236 --> 00:31:45.697
Meyers & Goldstein.
handles the books

735
00:31:45.739 --> 00:31:48.700
for both SuperMillions
and UpRight.

736
00:31:50.452 --> 00:31:53.496
You think that
Mayfield and Turnbull

737
00:31:53.538 --> 00:31:55.582
are embezzling funds
from the lottery.

738
00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:58.710
and smuggling
into her largest Super PAC?

739
00:31:58.752 --> 00:32:00.628
At the expense of our nation's
public schools.

740
00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:04.215
[laughs]

741
00:32:04.257 --> 00:32:07.052
Everything's a fucking
conspiracy.

742
00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:09.387
UpRight's books are sealed shut.

743
00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:11.222
Thanks to Turnbull's bill.
they don't have to report

744
00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:12.390
where the money comes from.

745
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:13.975
It could all be happening
under the same roof.

746
00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:15.977
-behind closed doors.
-Don't be that guy.

747
00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:18.646
-What guy?
-The bug-eyed virtual vigilante.

748
00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:22.108
running a bullshit blog
and a libelous YouTube channel

749
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.610
out of her parents' basement.

750
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:26.780
Okay. Tom Mayfield was
in Turnbull's office last night.

751
00:32:26.821 --> 00:32:28.406
I saw his name on the log-in.

752
00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:29.741
-Maybe they're still fucking.
-ELI: Nick.

753
00:32:29.783 --> 00:32:30.992
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

754
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.703
-Um. reigniting the spark.
-I'm serious.

755
00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:36.581
Turnbull's a bully
and a misguided idea log.

756
00:32:36.623 --> 00:32:37.540
She's not a crook.

757
00:32:39.542 --> 00:32:42.671
All I'm asking you to do
is to. you know.

758
00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:44.631
go into that legendary rolodex
of yours.

759
00:32:44.673 --> 00:32:46.508
and make one or two calls.

760
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:48.468
See if there's a relationship
between the top brass

761
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.471
at Meyers & Goldstein
and anyone in Turnbull's camp.

762
00:32:51.513 --> 00:32:55.016
If there's nothing there.
I will drop it. I promise.

763
00:32:58.269 --> 00:33:00.397
GIBBS:
How the fuck did this leak?

764
00:33:00.438 --> 00:33:01.189
NATE:
All right. It's done.

765
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:02.357
Let's move forward.

766
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.650
This might actually help us?

767
00:33:03.692 --> 00:33:05.026
GIBBS:
How's that?

768
00:33:05.068 --> 00:33:09.656
A full week for the word
to spread means more people.

769
00:33:09.698 --> 00:33:11.825
A ton more people.

770
00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:13.576
Bigger crowd means
more media attention.

771
00:33:13.618 --> 00:33:15.704
which might bring us
an air of legitimacy

772
00:33:15.745 --> 00:33:16.705
from the jump.

773
00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:22.168
I drafted a statement
last night.

774
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.254
Get it out ASAP and get to work

775
00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:28.216
on as many appearances
as you possibly can.

776
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:31.720
Uh. local morning shows.
county fairs. You name it.

777
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:35.181
We play this right.
soon. it'll be Late Night.

778
00:33:35.223 --> 00:33:39.269
And if we're lucky.
SNL will come calling.

779
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.812
Got it?

780
00:33:40.854 --> 00:33:42.439
Good. Let's get to work.

781
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.566
Oh. And. Lucas. pack your bags.

782
00:33:44.607 --> 00:33:46.693
What?

783
00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:47.902
You're gonna be living

784
00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:49.738
on the campaign bus
for the next few months.

785
00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:52.157
I hope you like
cornfields and Big Macs.

786
00:33:54.117 --> 00:33:55.785
Who doesn't?

787
00:33:55.827 --> 00:33:56.745
NATE:
Lucas.

788
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.542
You know that I know. right?

789
00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:03.668
Nate. I am so sorry.

790
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.211
NATE:
That's all right.

791
00:34:05.253 --> 00:34:06.212
Wouldn't be here without you.

792
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.798
And if I can't roll
with the punches.

793
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.133
I shouldn't be running
for president.

794
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:14.304
But we're building
something here.

795
00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:15.472
Something bigger than ourselves.

796
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.476
So. from here on out.
let's just keep things

797
00:34:19.517 --> 00:34:21.353
close to the chest. okay?

798
00:34:21.394 --> 00:34:22.437
Even in your own house.

799
00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:28.443
Pretend you're in the CIA.
See you on the campaign bus.

800
00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:34.240
[exhales deeply]

801
00:34:34.282 --> 00:34:36.576
[indistinct chatter]

802
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:49.381
You double-checked
the lotto stats?

803
00:34:49.422 --> 00:34:50.799
Triple-checked.

804
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.800
Let's go.

805
00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:59.516
The CEO of Meyers & Goldstein
hosted two private fundraisers

806
00:34:59.557 --> 00:35:01.601
for Turnbull
at his country house

807
00:35:01.643 --> 00:35:02.644
during the primaries.

808
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:04.437
It's probably
just a coincidence.

809
00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:07.774
But fishy enough for us
to follow the scent.

810
00:35:07.816 --> 00:35:10.610
Well. there's still something
I can't wrap my head around.

811
00:35:10.652 --> 00:35:12.570
If they really are cooking
the books.

812
00:35:12.612 --> 00:35:14.531
why are they willing to risk
years behind bars?

813
00:35:14.572 --> 00:35:16.950
Government shells out
500 billion a year

814
00:35:16.991 --> 00:35:18.952
in contracts
to the private sector.

815
00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:20.620
Meyers & Goldstein's
bread and butter.

816
00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:22.789
Right. So. what now?

817
00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:24.207
NICK:
Well. we get someone

818
00:35:24.249 --> 00:35:27.961
on the inside to help us
find proof and blow the whistle.

819
00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:29.921
ELI:
How do we do that?

820
00:35:29.963 --> 00:35:31.589
NICK:
That's a good question.

821
00:35:33.341 --> 00:35:35.301
I've got a neighbor
who pushes paper

822
00:35:35.343 --> 00:35:36.594
for Meyers & Goldstein.

823
00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:39.723
Got his kid into kindergarten.

824
00:35:39.764 --> 00:35:40.473
[chuckles]

825
00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.601
Fuck. I love this town.

826
00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:48.940
I help this poor guy piss away
30K in glorified daycare.

827
00:35:48.982 --> 00:35:50.900
and he owes me a favor.

828
00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:52.318
So. you'll get him
to fish around?

829
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.653
No. no. no. no.

830
00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:54.696
He wouldn't do that.

831
00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:58.616
He thinks that Turnbull
is Reagan in pearls.

832
00:35:58.658 --> 00:35:59.576
[chuckles softly]

833
00:35:59.617 --> 00:36:01.327
No.

834
00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:04.581
But I have got you an interview
with his associate in PR.

835
00:36:04.622 --> 00:36:08.585
So. go! Go.
Recruit us a double agent.

836
00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:10.337
Ooh. Where are you going?

837
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:12.505
I've got my own interview.

838
00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:13.673
ELI:
With who?

839
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:16.301
At worst.
your generation's Ralph Nader.

840
00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:18.511
At best.
the second coming of Christ.

841
00:36:18.553 --> 00:36:22.390
Although something tells me.
he's somewhere in between.

842
00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:31.399
(***)

843
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:49.417
(***)

844
00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:54.297
JENNIFER:
We're a perennial benefactor

845
00:36:54.339 --> 00:36:56.716
of the Boys and Girls Club
of DC. and this year.

846
00:36:56.758 --> 00:36:58.635
we've implemented
a company-wide day of service

847
00:36:58.677 --> 00:37:00.053
with Habitat for Humanity.

848
00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:01.596
Wow.

849
00:37:01.638 --> 00:37:04.724
It must be so rewarding.
giving inner-city kids

850
00:37:04.766 --> 00:37:05.725
safe places to grow.

851
00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:07.268
Hmm. It really is.

852
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.977
[chuckles]

853
00:37:08.019 --> 00:37:08.937
Is that your little one?

854
00:37:10.063 --> 00:37:11.606
JENNIFER:
Mm!
[chuckles]

855
00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:12.732
That's my Maya.

856
00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:14.984
ELI:
She is really beautiful.

857
00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:16.027
Isn't she? [laughs]

858
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:17.737
Look at those cheeks!

859
00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:19.447
You're so sweet.
Do you have kids?

860
00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:20.490
Maybe one day.

861
00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:22.951
But for now. this is my baby.

862
00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:25.704
So. Ms. Cooke--

863
00:37:25.745 --> 00:37:27.497
Oh. please call me. "Jennifer".

864
00:37:28.623 --> 00:37:30.291
Jennifer.

865
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:32.752
How do your company's
charitable donations compare

866
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.629
to its political donations?

867
00:37:36.506 --> 00:37:38.383
I knew you'd throw
a hard ball sooner or later.

868
00:37:38.425 --> 00:37:39.467
[chuckles]

869
00:37:39.509 --> 00:37:41.761
But I'm not privy
to that information.

870
00:37:41.803 --> 00:37:43.638
If you'd like to chat
about our sustainability--

871
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.891
What is your opinion
on Senator Patricia Turnbull?

872
00:37:46.933 --> 00:37:48.435
You mean personally?

873
00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:50.311
I. uh... [chuckles nervously]

874
00:37:50.353 --> 00:37:51.604
-What does this have to do--
-Some people think

875
00:37:51.646 --> 00:37:53.314
she would set the country
back 50 years.

876
00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:56.860
Listen. Between you and me.
I think she'd set

877
00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:58.903
the country back 100 years.

878
00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:01.364
But I don't understand
why you wanna talk to me--

879
00:38:01.406 --> 00:38:02.449
ELI:
Meyers & Goldstein

880
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.576
handles the books
for SuperMillions

881
00:38:04.617 --> 00:38:08.580
and for Turnbull's Super PAC.
UpRight.

882
00:38:08.621 --> 00:38:09.622
Isn't that correct?

883
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:12.917
I'm sorry. I can't discuss--

884
00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:15.128
Who handles those accounts?

885
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.464
-I'm not authorized--
-Does the same executive
cover both?

886
00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:18.840
Okay. I think
I'm gonna have to ask you

887
00:38:18.882 --> 00:38:20.383
-to leave--
-Please. Jennifer.

888
00:38:20.425 --> 00:38:21.593
If you don't tell me
what this is about--

889
00:38:21.634 --> 00:38:23.136
I. too. think Patricia Turnbull

890
00:38:23.178 --> 00:38:26.473
is on the wrong side of
history.
and potentially. the law.

891
00:38:27.974 --> 00:38:29.684
I think
you're gonna wanna see this.

892
00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:37.442
[pants]

893
00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:38.985
Planning for a comeback?

894
00:38:39.027 --> 00:38:41.029
NATE:
Running for president

895
00:38:41.071 --> 00:38:43.448
is more grueling
than decathlon.

896
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:45.450
[grunts]

897
00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:48.912
I'm surprised
you didn't cancel our interview.

898
00:38:48.953 --> 00:38:50.830
Why? 'Cause your team
did a better job than mine?

899
00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:52.082
Hmm.

900
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:55.460
My day maybe a bit more hectic
thanks to the Chronicle.

901
00:38:55.502 --> 00:38:57.420
but I always keep
my commitments.

902
00:38:57.462 --> 00:38:58.380
NICK:
All right.

903
00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:00.548
First question.

904
00:39:02.384 --> 00:39:03.551
Why?

905
00:39:03.593 --> 00:39:04.844
Why? [chuckles]

906
00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:06.012
NICK:
Yeah. I mean. you could earn
millions.

907
00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:07.931
slapping your face
on that protein shake.

908
00:39:07.972 --> 00:39:09.849
and spending your time
golfing and fishing.

909
00:39:09.891 --> 00:39:11.184
You know. not a bad life.

910
00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:13.520
So. again. I ask you. why?

911
00:39:15.146 --> 00:39:16.106
Because I suck at golf.

912
00:39:16.147 --> 00:39:18.024
[chuckles]

913
00:39:18.066 --> 00:39:19.067
NICK:
We've seen what happens

914
00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:21.069
when a narcissist
with no experience

915
00:39:22.028 --> 00:39:23.655
turns delusions of grandeur
into reality.

916
00:39:23.697 --> 00:39:26.533
So. you tell me
why this isn't anything

917
00:39:26.574 --> 00:39:27.784
more than a vanity run?

918
00:39:27.826 --> 00:39:29.536
Look. I think it's only fair

919
00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:30.829
you give me an honest
evaluation
before you diagnose me.

920
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.414
Mr. Booker.

921
00:39:32.455 --> 00:39:33.665
I'm not just coming
from the locker room

922
00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:35.041
to the debate stage.

923
00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:35.917
I went to Yale.

00:39:36.626 --> 00:39:37.419
NICK:
Oh. yeah. Law school.

925
00:39:38.586 --> 00:39:38.795
And your foundation's done
a lot of good.

926
00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:40.964
but you're up against
two candidates

927
00:39:41.006 --> 00:39:42.882
with damn near
a century's experience

928
00:39:42.924 --> 00:39:43.925
between them.

929
00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:45.844
How's that worked out for us.
huh?

930
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:48.430
You checked your
retirement portfolio lately?

931
00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:49.681
Have you been
to any of these towns

932
00:39:49.723 --> 00:39:51.891
destroyed by flash floods
or forest fires?

933
00:39:51.933 --> 00:39:54.728
You checked the numbers
on drug overdoses or suicides?

934
00:39:54.769 --> 00:39:56.980
Shit! Life expectancy's gone
down for the first time

935
00:39:57.022 --> 00:39:57.939
in decades.

936
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.610
People are desperate out there.

937
00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:03.945
They want somebody
to do something about it.

938
00:40:03.987 --> 00:40:05.697
Somebody to invest
in our future.

939
00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:08.116
not for the next four years.
but for the next 40 years.

940
00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:14.664

No.

I'm just trying to figure out if
you're for real or full of shit.

943
00:40:18.668 --> 00:40:19.586
That is for you to decide.

944
00:40:20.754 --> 00:40:22.255
I assure you.
my work was very real

945
00:40:22.297 --> 00:40:24.466
to tens of thousands
of grieving families.

946
00:40:24.507 --> 00:40:26.676
Well. you surely made
some very powerful enemies.

947
00:40:26.718 --> 00:40:28.470
NATE:
Who? Big drug companies?

948
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:29.971
They were selling
bold-faced lies.

949
00:40:30.013 --> 00:40:32.932
Claiming oxy wasn't addictive.
Let me ask you a question.

950
00:40:32.974 --> 00:40:34.976
How much do you think the NRA
spend on lobbying every year?

951
00:40:35.018 --> 00:40:36.102
Two. three million?

952
00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:37.312
NATE:
Correct.

953
00:40:37.354 --> 00:40:38.813
What do you think big pharma
spent last year?

954
00:40:40.523 --> 00:40:42.233
300 million.

955
00:40:42.275 --> 00:40:44.611
-They say they got nothing
to hide?
-[Nick chuckles]

956
00:40:44.652 --> 00:40:47.530

medicine
costs more than my alimony.

00:40:47.572 --> 00:40:49.199
-[Nate chuckles]
-We're gonna do something
about that. too.

958
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.241
Oh. my ex-wife?

959
00:40:50.283 --> 00:40:51.159
Please. please do.

And tell me why you think
you can win.

963
00:41:02.837 --> 00:41:04.631
'Cause I'll tell you
what Vegas thinks.

964
00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:07.801
You don't stand a chance.
Then what?

965
00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:10.053
You peel off enough votes
from the president

966
00:41:10.095 --> 00:41:13.515
to hand Turnbull the election
on a silver platter.

967
00:41:14.933 --> 00:41:15.934

Okay. listen. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

the information you need.

974
00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.991
And what if I can't?

975
00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.284
Then what?

976
00:41:33.326 --> 00:41:35.245
Do we just let them get away
with it?

977
00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:36.996
Your bosses could be committing
a crime

978
00:41:37.038 --> 00:41:38.998
that has devastating
ripple effects.

979
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.085
and it would be a crime
with no consequence.

980
00:41:42.127 --> 00:41:44.045
no punishment.
no accountability.

981
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.340
But that's just the way
the world works I guess. Right?

982
00:41:47.382 --> 00:41:48.925
Nothing we can do about it.

00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:58.420
That's confidential.

It's everything we need.

And so. I made a judgment call.

1085
00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:32.245
Something this big.
the ends justify the means.

which has caused local tax
revenues to fall off the cliff.

1224
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.070
And this is my first time
voting.

1225
00:56:44.612 --> 00:56:47.991
(***)

1226
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.786
[sighs]

1227
00:57:20.815 --> 00:57:21.983
Nick.

1228
00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:22.984
Huh?

1229
00:57:24.152 --> 00:57:24.944
ELI:
Does it make any sense

1230
00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:26.988
for the director
of SuperMillions

1231
00:57:28.239 --> 00:57:29.532
to send an expense report
for a holiday party

1232
00:57:29.574 --> 00:57:32.535
to a partner
at Meyers & Goldstein?

1233
00:57:32.577 --> 00:57:34.537
No.

1234
00:57:34.579 --> 00:57:37.499
An assistant would perform
those menial tasks. Why?

1235
00:57:55.183 --> 00:57:56.685
I think these invoices
are fakes.

1236
00:57:58.728 --> 00:58:01.231
They each contain
a four. an eight. or both.

1237
00:58:01.272 --> 00:58:02.023
That's the tell.

1238
00:58:02.565 --> 00:58:03.983
Well. it's human nature

1239
00:58:04.025 --> 00:58:05.985
to prefer some numbers
over others.

1240
00:58:06.027 --> 00:58:08.697
This is how companies spot
expense-account fraud.

1241
00:58:08.738 --> 00:58:11.741
I mean. I'm willing to bet
that the Memorial Day retreat

1242
00:58:11.783 --> 00:58:12.701
didn't even happen.

1243
00:58:12.742 --> 00:58:13.868
NICK:
Well. any real invoices

1244
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.161
from Patriot Catering

1245
00:58:15.203 --> 00:58:17.789
sure didn't pass
through these execs.

1246
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:25.213
ELI:
174684.

1247
00:58:28.216 --> 00:58:37.142
(***)

1248
00:58:40.895 --> 00:58:44.858
The average SuperMillions
jackpot is $20 million.

1249
00:58:44.899 --> 00:58:48.028
In recessions. jackpots
increase by approximately

1250
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:49.863
eight percent.

1251
00:58:49.904 --> 00:58:52.073
So. that means
that the average jackpot

1252
00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:54.117
-should be...
-21.6 million.

1253
00:58:55.368 --> 00:58:58.163
Correct. 21.6 million.

1254
00:58:58.204 --> 00:59:02.709
But it's holding steady
at 19 million.

1255
00:59:02.751 --> 00:59:05.712
Well. that's a gap
of 2.6 million per drawing.

1256
00:59:09.674 --> 00:59:12.093
ELI:
Right. The first
Patriot trading invoice

1257
00:59:12.135 --> 00:59:16.056
goes back to 34 weeks ago.

1258
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:19.392
Two drawings a week. That's...

1259
00:59:19.434 --> 00:59:20.352
ELI:
That is...

1260
00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:24.314
God.

1261
00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:30.362
-Pretty damn close to bulls-eye.
-Holy fuck.

1262
00:59:31.696 --> 00:59:34.949
For every $1.000 embezzled

1263
00:59:34.991 --> 00:59:36.076
from the SuperMillions lottery

1264
00:59:37.285 --> 00:59:38.370
and transferred to UpRight.
the invoice...

1265
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:40.038
Show a buck.

1266
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:40.955
Yeah.

1267
00:59:40.997 --> 00:59:42.916
That's their fucking code.

1268
00:59:44.793 --> 00:59:45.335
[sighs]

1269
00:59:45.377 --> 00:59:46.419
ELI:
Erickson.

1270
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:49.756
Erickson fudges the books. okay?

1271
00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:52.717
The money moves
in the dark of night.

1272
00:59:52.759 --> 00:59:56.971
The-- the-- the-- the invoices
track the spoils.

1273
00:59:57.013 --> 01:00:00.266
letting them communicate
without having to type fraud

1274
01:00:00.308 --> 01:00:01.685
in the subject line.

1275
01:00:01.726 --> 01:00:02.769
[Nick chuckles]

1276
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:04.229
A barn full of haystacks.

1277
01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.358
And you found
the fucking needle.

1278
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.693
[chuckles softly]

1279
01:00:09.734 --> 01:00:10.276
[indistinct chatter]

1280
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.152
COLLEGE KID:
Thank you.

1281
01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:20.161
(***)

1282
01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:26.292
Hey. can I bum a cigarette?

1283
01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.293
COLLEGE KID:
Oh. yeah.

1284
01:00:30.338 --> 01:00:31.297
ELI:
Thanks.

1285
01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:33.091
Oh. so. you're the caterer.

1286
01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.801
-COLLEGE KID: Yeah.
-Excellent job inside.

1287
01:00:34.843 --> 01:00:36.720
Those deviled eggs
look delicious.

1288
01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:37.846
COLLEGE KID:
Thanks.

1289
01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:38.805
I wish I could tell you
that I made them.

1290
01:00:39.931 --> 01:00:41.016
but I just load 'em in
and hand 'em out.

1291
01:00:41.057 --> 01:00:42.475
[exhales]

1292
01:00:42.517 --> 01:00:44.728
"Patriot Catering." [chuckles]

1293
01:00:44.769 --> 01:00:46.855
-COLLEGE KID: That's us.
-Haven't seen you guys before.

1294
01:00:46.896 --> 01:00:47.939
Have you been in business
for a long time?

1295
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.150
Uh. coming up to a year.

1296
01:00:50.191 --> 01:00:52.193
-ELI: Wow. Really new.
-Mm-hmm.

1297
01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:53.987
-ELI: Family-owned?
-Nope.

1298
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:55.905
This dude named Dean owns it.

1299
01:00:55.947 --> 01:00:57.991
Wait. Not Dean Bender.

1300
01:00:58.033 --> 01:01:00.744
No. Dean Clifton.

1301
01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:03.079
Oh. gotcha. Clifton.

1302
01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:04.247
Yeah.

1303
01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.082
So. you got a lot of events
coming up?

1304
01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.752
-Rubbing elbows with D.C.
big wigs?
-[college kid chuckles]

1305
01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:10.170
COLLEGE KID:
We got some big ones coming up.

1306
01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.964
But honestly. they're. like.
all the same to me. you know?

1307
01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:15.884
Same bacon-wrapped scallops.
Same penguin suit.

1308
01:01:15.925 --> 01:01:17.802
Same rich folks
boring up the place.

1309
01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:20.513
[chuckles]

1310
01:01:20.555 --> 01:01:22.098
You got a card?

1311
01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.850
COLLEGE KID:
Oh. yeah.

1312
01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:26.853
Just you know. somewhere here.

1313
01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:29.064
Here.
Uh. the menu's in that link.

1314
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.776
So. if you ever throw a bash.
you know. we're around.

1315
01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:35.070
Cool. Thanks.

1316
01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:36.279
-Yeah.
-And thanks.

1317
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:38.239
-Yeah. Have a good one.
-You. too.

1318
01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:43.953
MODERATOR:
Thank you.
Thank you. Mr. President.

1319
01:01:43.995 --> 01:01:46.122
We need to move on.
and I wanna give

1320
01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:49.417
Mr. Sterling a chance to
respond
before closing statements.

1321
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:51.002
Let's face it.

1322
01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.879
Washington's got one foot
so far left

1323
01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:56.216
and the other so far right.
that it can't stand up straight.

1324
01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.468
Congress is doing a split
in the quicksand.

1325
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:59.969
and I'm the only guy
that can pull us out

1326
01:02:00.011 --> 01:02:01.137
of this partisan quagmire.

1327
01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:04.057
Why?
Because I'm free.

1328
01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:06.935
Free of special interests.
Free of party-power brokers.

1329
01:02:06.976 --> 01:02:09.396
And I'm free to explore
the best ideas

1330
01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:11.147
from both sides of the aisle.

1331
01:02:11.189 --> 01:02:13.024
Because I don't sit
on either one.

1332
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.109
I stand proudly in the middle.

1333
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.238
Credentials to the debate?

1334
01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:21.866
TURNBULL (ON TV):
Sure.

1335
01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:24.953
What's it being Booker's
lapdog.
eh?

1336
01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:28.415
[barks]

1337
01:02:28.456 --> 01:02:30.041
TURNBULL:
But what you don't seem
to understand. sir.

1338
01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:31.835
we're talking about decisions

1339
01:02:31.876 --> 01:02:34.004
that can mean the difference
between life and death.

1340
01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:35.922
-The wisdom...
-Tell me the truth. though.

1341
01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:39.175
Has. um...
has the old man lost a step?

1342
01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:42.971
You know. just putting
so much time

1343
01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:45.515
into a cub with a rap sheet.

1344
01:02:47.183 --> 01:02:49.561
If I were you. I would just
keep
asking myself why?

1345
01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:53.106
I'm trying to watch the debate.

1346
01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:55.275
Take it easy. Patricia.

1347
01:02:55.316 --> 01:02:57.444
Mr. Sterling represented
our country proudly.

1348
01:02:57.485 --> 01:02:58.862
TURNBULL:
Oh. oh. oh.

1349
01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:00.572
I beg your pardon.
Mr. President.

1350
01:03:00.613 --> 01:03:03.074
The only reason you're giving
his lack of experience

1351
01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:05.910
a hall pass is because you see
in the polls

1352
01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:08.872
that he's gonna steal more
votes
from me than he is from you

1353
01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:10.874
in key battleground states.

1354
01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:14.836
But this election
is about so much more

1355
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:15.837
than politics.

1356
01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:19.299
And I'm not even talking
about what it'll mean

1357
01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:23.178
to millions of little girls
to see a woman take

1358
01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:25.930
the oath of office
for the very first time

1359
01:03:25.972 --> 01:03:27.223
in this country.

1360
01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:30.018
That's significant. Oh!

1361
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.978
Yes. it is.

1362
01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.397
But let's leave that discussion
to the history books.

1363
01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:36.024
'cause what I wanna talk
about right now

1364
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.277
is what my administration
is gonna do

1365
01:03:39.319 --> 01:03:42.530
to make your lives better.
Plain simple.

1366
01:03:42.572 --> 01:03:45.033
Like fixing that pothole
on your street.

1367
01:03:45.075 --> 01:03:48.328
Getting your 401K moving up
and to the right again.

1368
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.663
Keeping you
and your children safe

1369
01:03:50.705 --> 01:03:52.624
from enemies.
foreign and domestic.

1370
01:03:52.665 --> 01:03:55.377
Pulling us out of this
recession
once and for all.

1371
01:03:56.503 --> 01:04:00.006
And most importantly.
shining a light

1372
01:04:00.048 --> 01:04:03.009
on the working people
of this country

1373
01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:05.595
who have been invisible
for far too long.

1374
01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:09.057
That's what
I'm gonna talk about.

1375
01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.892
[crowd cheering. whistling]

1376
01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:11.893
Thank you.

1377
01:04:13.144 --> 01:04:14.562
What will it mean

1378
01:04:14.604 --> 01:04:17.232
for millions of little girls
to see a female president?

1379
01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:20.402
Far more than I could ever
comprehend.

1380
01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:24.364
But what's it gonna mean
for our environment.

1381
01:04:24.406 --> 01:04:28.284
for our teachers.
for our poor and middle class

1382
01:04:28.326 --> 01:04:30.286
to see you as president.
Senator Turnbull?

1383
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:34.332
We are long overdue for a woman
in the White House.

1384
01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:36.459
But it can't just be any woman.

1385
01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:38.420
It's gotta be the right woman.

1386
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:39.963
Not a woman that denied
climate change

1387
01:04:40.005 --> 01:04:41.256
is real till just last year.

1388
01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:45.510
And that is precisely
why my cabinet

1389
01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:47.012
will be made up
of 50 percent women

1390
01:04:47.053 --> 01:04:47.971
at the very minimal.

1391
01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:50.140
[crowd cheering]

1392
01:04:53.018 --> 01:04:55.061
[indistinct chatter]

1393
01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:57.022
-You look nice.
-LUCAS: Thanks.

1394
01:04:57.063 --> 01:04:58.940
I can't believe we're actually
in the same state.

1395
01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.358
I kinda like it.

1396
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.193
Think you might wanna ditch
your credentials.

1397
01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:04.404
You'll scare the personality
out of everyone.

1398
01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:06.197
Hey. Nate.

1399
01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:07.449
-Awesome job.
-[Nate chuckles]

1400
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:09.242
Thank you.
What are the mosquitos sayin'?

1401
01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:11.327
Well. most of the pundits
are calling it for you.

1402
01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:13.246
and Twitter's looking
pretty bullish.

1403
01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:15.081
You remember my girlfriend.
Eli.

1404
01:05:15.123 --> 01:05:16.499
[chuckles]
That I do.

1405
01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:20.003
I hear you're making big waves
over at the Chronicle.

1406
01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:21.129
[chuckles]

1407
01:05:21.171 --> 01:05:23.340
Splashing about
in the shallow end.

1408
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:25.050
but I'm trying.

1409
01:05:25.091 --> 01:05:25.967
NATE:
I'm sure you had to disclose

1410
01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:27.385
that you're dating
this handsome guy.

1411
01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:28.720
I did.

1412
01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:30.638
But it helps that I'm not
covering your campaign.

1413
01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:32.932
NATE:
Of course.

1414
01:05:32.974 --> 01:05:33.683
What did you think
of the debate?

1415
01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:36.144
Honestly?

1416
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.772
I'd be surprised
if you didn't poach

1417
01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:40.398
a point or two
from both parties.

1418
01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:43.401
-She's a keeper.
-LUCAS: Hmm.

1419
01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:44.986
And you. miss.

1420
01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:46.488
you are lucky to have a guy
like this by your side.

1421
01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:48.615
As are you.

1422
01:05:50.075 --> 01:05:50.408
Speaking of which. Lucas.
can I steal you for a second?

1423
01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:51.493
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

1424
01:05:51.951 --> 01:05:52.494
Thank you.

1425
01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:58.500
LUCAS:
Hey.

1426
01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:00.710
[indistinct chatter]

1427
01:06:04.673 --> 01:06:05.715
COLLEGE KID:
May I take these?

1428
01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:09.511
Hey. Patriot Catering?

1429
01:06:09.552 --> 01:06:11.388
[chuckles] I'll be damned.

1430
01:06:11.429 --> 01:06:12.597
-[Eli chuckles]
-How goes it?

1431
01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.140
[Eli gasps]

1432
01:06:14.182 --> 01:06:15.642
-Wait. This is the big event?
-COLLEGE KID: Yeah.

1433
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:18.311
The most exciting night
of your life. right?

1434
01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:19.521
So boring.

1435
01:06:19.562 --> 01:06:21.648
You might just be serving
the next president

1436
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.149
of the United States of America.

1437
01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:25.360
That dude?

1438
01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:27.028
We've been catering for him
since before he entered

1439
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.737
the race.

1440
01:06:27.779 --> 01:06:29.030
The lustre's worn off.

1441
01:06:30.031 --> 01:06:31.074
Plus. the boss doesn't want me
to spread around.

1442
01:06:32.742 --> 01:06:34.494
Makes sense.

1443
01:06:34.536 --> 01:06:36.705
I mean. you probably do
business
with the Republicans. too.

1444
01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:38.164
No. just Sterling.

1445
01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:39.374
Dean's loyal like that.

1446
01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:41.418
I should probably get back
to work.

1447
01:06:41.459 --> 01:06:43.503
He likes us to move around.

1448
01:06:43.545 --> 01:06:45.463
-Dean is here?
-Yeah.

1449
01:06:45.505 --> 01:06:48.508
Talking to Sterling
and Jack Hampton.

1450
01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:50.719
He's looking over here.
I better keep moving.

1451
01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.390
I'll see you at the next one.

1452
01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:00.687
-MAYFIELD: Hey! Gentlemen!
-NATE: Hey! How are you. sir?

1453
01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:03.356
-Tom Mayfield.
-LUCAS: I'm Lucas.

1454
01:07:03.398 --> 01:07:04.274
Nice to meet you.

1455
01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:08.236
(***)

1456
01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:13.575
LUCAS:
Hey.

1457
01:07:13.616 --> 01:07:16.453
That was the owner
of your paper.

1458
01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:18.329
Don't worry.
I didn't embarrass you.

1459
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:19.330
Who else is there?

1460
01:07:20.582 --> 01:07:21.583
Bunch of big donors.

1461
01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:24.252
The guy on the right
owns a slew

1462
01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:25.754
of catering companies.

1463
01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:29.299
Nate says that he is
a culinary mastermind.

1464
01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:30.550
What's his name?

1465
01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:32.302
Uh. Dean something.

1466
01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:33.428
Everyone calls him "The Chef."

1467
01:07:34.804 --> 01:07:36.806
-I gotta go.
-Hey. What? We just got here.

1468
01:07:36.848 --> 01:07:38.683
Lucas. I gotta go.

1469
01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:40.268
I haven't seen you in weeks
and you're leaving?

1470
01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.311
Eli!

1471
01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:50.320
(***)

1472
01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:08.338
(***)

1473
01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:19.766
How was it?

1474
01:08:19.808 --> 01:08:21.601
ELI:
Nick. we need to talk.

1475
01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:24.270
Turnbull isn't embezzling money
from SuperMillions.

1476
01:08:24.312 --> 01:08:25.313
Sterling is.

1477
01:08:27.148 --> 01:08:28.233
You think that's funny?

1478
01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.317
ELI:
No. I'm serious.

1479
01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:33.780
Patriot Catering worked
his debate afterparty.

1480
01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:36.366
They have catered
all of Sterling's events

1481
01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:38.618
since before he entered
the race.

1482
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.870
It was right in front
of our faces the whole time.

1483
01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:42.580
Meyers & Goldstein.
they handled the books

1484
01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:43.957
for Sterling's Super PAC
as well.

1485
01:08:43.998 --> 01:08:46.292
Sterling reject
the Super PAC on principle.

1486
01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:47.669
ELI:
In the first month
of his campaign.

1487
01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:48.628
he made a big show of it.

1488
01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:49.879
But that did not last long.

1489
01:08:53.174 --> 01:08:54.968
NICK:
Integrity Super PAC?
[scoffs]

1490
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.594
That's an oxymoron.

1491
01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:58.638
Yeah. He named it something
generic to keep a low profile--

1492
01:09:00.098 --> 01:09:01.224
Yeah. Still. still. still.
this isn't definitive proof

1493
01:09:01.266 --> 01:09:03.518
that he--
Why would he be that bold?

1494
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.312
Juice isn't worth the squeeze.
He's up three points.

1495
01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:07.564
He is now.

1496
01:09:07.605 --> 01:09:08.815
But this time last year.
his name

1497
01:09:08.857 --> 01:09:10.191
wasn't on a single poll.

1498
01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:13.236
What's the only way to win
the New York City Marathon

1499
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:14.195
without any training?

1500
01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:17.574
Take the subway.
sneak under the rope

1501
01:09:17.615 --> 01:09:18.950
-on mile 18.
-On mile 18.

1502
01:09:21.494 --> 01:09:24.581
But Mayfield.
that bow-tied prick.

1503
01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:27.250
I mean. he's a Republican.
It doesn't make any sense.

1504
01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:28.501
I thought the same thing.

1505
01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:30.754
So. I checked out
his voting records.

1506
01:09:30.795 --> 01:09:33.381
And it turns out.
he left the Republican Party

1507
01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:36.009
right after Reagan rode off
into the sunset.

1508
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:38.720
The man has been an independent
for the last three decades.

1509
01:09:38.762 --> 01:09:41.514
And then he reregistered
as a Republican the same month

1510
01:09:41.556 --> 01:09:43.516
that Sterling's book
hit the best-seller list.

1511
01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:45.643
It was all calculated.

1512
01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:46.895
He must have thought
if people like us picked up

1513
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.605
a scent. it would throw us
off the trail. and...

1514
01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:50.899
it worked.

1515
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.985
What the fuck do we do now?

1516
01:09:57.405 --> 01:09:58.948
Follow the facts
wherever they lead.

1517
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.534
Sometimes.
it's not where you wanna go.

1518
01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:02.827
but you go anyway.

1519
01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:08.291
[sighs]

1520
01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.834
CORRESPONDENT 13 (ON TV):
With just one week to go.

1521
01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:12.545
Nate Sterling has pulled ahead
of Senator Turnbull

1522
01:10:13.588 --> 01:10:15.256
for the first time
in national polling.

1523
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:17.884
While the lead is still
within the margin of error...

1524
01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:19.969
Sterling is our megaphone.

1525
01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:22.889
our voice of reason.
our moral compass.

1526
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:24.599
and our hope
for a better tomorrow.

1527
01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.273
Shit. Eli.

1528
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:34.651
Where did you run off to?

1529
01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:38.780
What's wrong?

1530
01:10:42.283 --> 01:10:43.034
You see your dad?

1531
01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:47.455
-You're gonna have to scrap
that speech.
-Why? The town hall's tomorrow--

1532
01:10:47.497 --> 01:10:48.707
Because you're not a liar.

1533
01:10:48.748 --> 01:10:50.458
What are you talking about?

1534
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.752
-He's funding his campaign
with stolen money.
-What? Who?

1535
01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:54.337
Sterling.

1536
01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:56.297
-What are you saying?
-I have hard evidence.

1537
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:59.718
He's embezzling money
from the lottery.

1538
01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:00.927
and funneling
it to his Super PAC.

1539
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.679
What? That's crazy.

1540
01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:03.972
It's the truth.

1541
01:11:04.014 --> 01:11:05.056
Nick and I have been working
this story--

1542
01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:07.684
No. Why are you telling me this?

1543
01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:09.019
I guess I thought

1544
01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.061
you might like to know
that your hero is a fraud.

1545
01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:11.730
Hey. Stop!

1546
01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:13.732
ELI:
And because I need your help.

1547
01:11:13.773 --> 01:11:15.775
Are you--
are you listening to yourself?

1548
01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:18.653
I need someone on the inside
to prove he signed off on it.

1549
01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:21.865
Here.

1550
01:11:21.906 --> 01:11:23.658
I need you to fill this
with Sterling's hard drive.

1551
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.368
-We don't have much time.
-LUCAS: You're delusional.

1552
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:26.494
ELI:
Goddammit. Lucas!

1553
01:11:26.536 --> 01:11:28.038
You're in denial.

1554
01:11:28.079 --> 01:11:29.831
LUCAS:
No. You can't fucking
help yourself. can you?

1555
01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:31.791
Only this time.
when you blow yourself up.

1556
01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.626
you could take me
and the whole goddamn country

1557
01:11:33.668 --> 01:11:34.794
-down with you.
-No. This is different.

1558
01:11:34.836 --> 01:11:35.837
This is real.

1559
01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:38.840
Okay. Let's say that it is real.

1560
01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:42.635
You go from reporting
back-page news

1561
01:11:42.677 --> 01:11:44.346
to being front-page news.

1562
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.931
I get what?

1563
01:11:46.973 --> 01:11:49.768
A seat on the witness stand
in the trial of the century

1564
01:11:49.809 --> 01:11:51.019
when the only thing
I have witnessed

1565
01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:53.355
is a good man
trying to save his country.

1566
01:11:54.731 --> 01:11:56.483
We get hate mails
from our friends.

1567
01:11:56.524 --> 01:11:57.484
the people we respect.

1568
01:11:57.525 --> 01:11:58.651
And then what?

1569
01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:01.571
Gun-toting. gay-bashing.
autocratic zealots.

1570
01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:04.074
they declare us heroes.
and the navel-gazing.

1571
01:12:04.115 --> 01:12:05.992
holier-than-thou woke mob.
they throw us

1572
01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:06.910
a fucking parade.

1573
01:12:07.952 --> 01:12:08.578
congratulations
to the both of us?

1574
01:12:09.829 --> 01:12:10.080
ELI:
Lucas. please calm down.
And just think--

1575
01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:11.498
No. you think!

1576
01:12:15.543 --> 01:12:18.672
Are you willing to keep Penny
at war for the next ten years?

1577
01:12:18.713 --> 01:12:21.966
No. Are you willing to sit
on your hands

1578
01:12:22.008 --> 01:12:24.386
while the fucking Earth fries.
because I'm not.

1579
01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:26.680
The money that he is stealing

1580
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.056
is coming from schools.
like that one in--

1581
01:12:28.098 --> 01:12:29.808
that one in West Virginia.

1582
01:12:29.849 --> 01:12:31.935
Okay? Those kids.
Black and brown kids

1583
01:12:31.976 --> 01:12:33.019
are losing access to a fair
and equal education.

1584
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:35.021
Eli. it is so much bigger than--

1585
01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:37.107
Don't you fucking finish
that thought!

1586
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:40.151
Why doesn't this matter to you?

1587
01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:41.903
They matter!

1588
01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:43.196
Everyone else in this country
can act like they don't exist--

1589
01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:45.156
LUCAS:
He is what this country needs!

1590
01:12:45.198 --> 01:12:47.575
A liar is the last thing
this country needs!

1591
01:12:48.743 --> 01:12:50.120
Liars are what fucked
this country up

1592
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:51.162
in the first place.

1593
01:12:52.914 --> 01:12:55.709
Iraq has stockpiles of WMDs.

1594
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.585
The housing market
will continue to rise.

1595
01:12:57.627 --> 01:12:59.754
The election was rigged.
Redlining.

1596
01:13:01.172 --> 01:13:03.174
The war on drugs.
voter suppression!

1597
01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:08.138
Everywhere you look. lobbyists.
pundits. bankers. preachers.

1598
01:13:08.179 --> 01:13:11.433
billion-dollar industries
that run on lies.

1599
01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:12.809
LUCAS:
What is it that you want. Eli?

1600
01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:14.894
-I want-- I want the truth.
-LUCAS: Yeah.

1601
01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:16.521
Well. you've been duped before.
so.

1602
01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:18.982
[sighs]

1603
01:13:23.236 --> 01:13:24.904
Did you know. Lucas?

1604
01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:29.701
I can't believe
you would even think that.

1605
01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:32.996
[exhales shakily]

1606
01:13:35.123 --> 01:13:37.876
I'm publishing this story
with or without your help.

1607
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.839
You publish this story.

1608
01:13:43.965 --> 01:13:44.591
I don't want anything
to do with you.

1609
01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:46.134
-That is not fair.
-What do you want me to say?

1610
01:13:47.635 --> 01:13:48.678
Love fades. values don't.

1611
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:57.645
(***)

1612
01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:01.191
That's my fucking jacket!

1613
01:14:01.232 --> 01:14:05.153
(***)

1614
01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:07.489
LUCAS:
Nice.

1615
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:11.493
(***)

1616
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:14.913

1617

(***)

1618
01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:32.597
Meet me at Recessions.

1619
01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:35.850
Two blocks northwest
of Farragut Square.

1620
01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:38.186
I have something.

1621
01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:40.814
[indistinct chatter]

1622
01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:46.653
We prove that Sterling knew.

1623
01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:47.821
-NICK: Eli.
-ELI: I'm going tonight.

1624
01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:49.656
Well. Jesus Christ. Eli.

1625
01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:51.074
You're being irrational.

1626
01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:52.742
There's a right way
and a wrong way.

1627
01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:54.577
If you want the ribeye.
you go get the ribeye.

1628
01:14:54.619 --> 01:14:55.995
Not if it's contaminated.

1629
01:14:56.037 --> 01:14:57.956
That ends a career
before it starts.

1630
01:14:57.997 --> 01:14:59.708
Well. already lost
my relationship.

1631
01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:01.001
I'm losing my dad.

1632
01:15:01.042 --> 01:15:02.836
So. why not throw in a career
for good measure?

1633
01:15:02.877 --> 01:15:04.212
You're losing your mind
is what you're losing.

1634
01:15:05.255 --> 01:15:06.214
Wait.

1635
01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:08.216
Relationship?

1636
01:15:09.926 --> 01:15:10.885
Lucas refuses to--

1637
01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:12.846
Oh. fuck. Eli!

1638
01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:14.097
You told him?

1639
01:15:14.139 --> 01:15:15.390
[sighs]

1640
01:15:15.432 --> 01:15:18.143
They'll have the place
power-cleaned in an hour.

1641
01:15:18.184 --> 01:15:20.645
Shit! Shit!

1642
01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:21.646
You're right.

1643
01:15:21.688 --> 01:15:25.650
(***)

1644
01:15:28.653 --> 01:15:29.863
Eli! Shit!

1645
01:15:31.656 --> 01:15:32.615
Fuck.

1646
01:15:33.742 --> 01:15:34.284
Hello?

1647
01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:36.703
Eli. Wait. Who is this?

1648
01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:37.912
-Nick. put Eli on.
-Hang on.

1649
01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:44.586
Just talk to Eli.
I'm sorry. Lucas.

1650
01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:46.046
She just doesn't wanna talk
to you.

1651
01:15:46.087 --> 01:15:46.963
Where are you?

1652
01:15:48.006 --> 01:15:49.215
We're at Recessions
on 18th and L.

1653
01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:50.050
LUCAS:
Bullshit!

1654
01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:51.217
You're at the campaign office.

1655
01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:52.385
I'm on my way.

1656
01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:53.887
Don't do anything stupid.

1657
01:15:53.928 --> 01:15:56.181
They sing karaoke this good
at the campaign?

1658
01:15:56.222 --> 01:15:58.641
[indiscernible singing]

1659
01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:01.227
Shit! All right.

1660
01:16:01.269 --> 01:16:03.021
Just tell her to stay
right there.

1661
01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:05.732
(***)

1662
01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:18.620

1663
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:36.638

1664
01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.651
(***)

1665
01:16:49.693 --> 01:16:50.652
ELI:
Shit!

1666
01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:53.947
(***)

1667
01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:58.785
What the hell
are you doing here?

1668
01:16:58.827 --> 01:17:02.122
-It's past midnight.
Lucas isn't--
-I have numbers. emails. names.

1669
01:17:02.163 --> 01:17:03.957
[scoffs] Sorry. what?

1670
01:17:03.998 --> 01:17:08.128
Tom Mayfield. Spencer Erickson.
Dean Clifton. Patriot Catering.

1671
01:17:08.169 --> 01:17:11.047
I have concrete evidence
of all parties involved.

1672
01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:12.048
You give me one good reason

1673
01:17:13.216 --> 01:17:13.383
right now I shouldn't call
Secret Service

1674
01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:14.676
and throw you in jail.

1675
01:17:15.802 --> 01:17:17.012
-We'd be sharing a cell.
- NATE: Bullshit.

1676
01:17:17.053 --> 01:17:18.972
I would think twice
before you call security.

1677
01:17:19.014 --> 01:17:21.474
The story is already written.
It's in the drafts.

1678
01:17:21.516 --> 01:17:24.978
You have me arrested.
it goes on Twitter instantly.

1679
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.813
Newspapers in the morning.

1680
01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:28.273
What's this little story about?

1681
01:17:28.314 --> 01:17:30.108
-You know what it's about.
-Enlighten me.

1682
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.818
ELI:
What it's always about.

1683
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.819
Money.

1684
01:17:35.864 --> 01:17:37.907
-Did you know?
-NATE: Know what?

1685
01:17:37.949 --> 01:17:40.493
All I know is I love my country.

1686
01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:41.745
All right? I'm our best hope.

1687
01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.039
I give us a fighting chance.

1688
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:48.710
Wow.

1689
01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:52.714
(***)

1690
01:17:57.844 --> 01:17:59.262
Are you a patriot. Eli?

1691
01:17:59.304 --> 01:18:02.015
Patriots don't steal
from the American people.

1692
01:18:02.057 --> 01:18:03.475
Who are you to accuse anyone of
stealing.

1693
01:18:03.516 --> 01:18:05.477
you fucking hypocrite?

1694
01:18:05.518 --> 01:18:06.436
Give it to me.

1695
01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:16.029
[sighs]

1696
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:18.365
You know. I think you and I
have a lot in common. Eli.

1697
01:18:18.406 --> 01:18:20.367
And for one.
we both lack experience.

1698
01:18:20.408 --> 01:18:22.077
Turnbull and Archer are
canaries
with that attack line.

1699
01:18:22.118 --> 01:18:25.038
I'm ahead
in every one of the polls.

1700
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.041
economy. hot buttons.
but the race. still a dead heat.

1701
01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.376
Why is that?

1702
01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:31.795
'Cause unfortunately.
for me and for you.

1703
01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:32.837
experience seems to matter.

1704
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:35.507
The way I see it.

1705
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.052
your story
might cause a little stir.

1706
01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:41.471
When it comes down to it.
who's gonna believe you?

1707
01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:43.390
You lack the most vital asset
a journalist must have.

1708
01:18:43.431 --> 01:18:45.308
credibility.

1709
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.894
Looks like I'm late
to the party.

1710
01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:50.271
-Uh. Mr. Booker.
What a surprise--
-Sit the fuck down.

1711
01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:52.941
Now...

1712
01:18:54.317 --> 01:18:57.320
let us all take a deep breath

1713
01:18:57.362 --> 01:18:59.406
and talk this out

1714
01:18:59.447 --> 01:19:02.242
like the rational people we are.

1715
01:19:02.283 --> 01:19:03.368
Nate. don't say a word.

1716
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:04.577
Eli records everything
on her phone.

1717
01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:05.995
-What?
-Let me see.

1718
01:19:06.037 --> 01:19:07.163
Get off! It's not on me.

1719
01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:10.792
Hey! No. no. Leave him out.

1720
01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:12.961
-NICK: That won't be necessary.
-NATE: Hey!

1721
01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:13.920
You wanna talk or what?

1722
01:19:21.177 --> 01:19:22.178
What the fuck?

1723
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.805
NATE:
All right.

1724
01:19:23.847 --> 01:19:24.264
All right?

1725
01:19:26.474 --> 01:19:27.434
Let's just take a deep breath.

1726
01:19:29.477 --> 01:19:31.104
Sit down and talk this out.
okay?

1727
01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:33.314
This is obviously some sort
of huge misunderstanding.

1728
01:19:33.356 --> 01:19:34.607
NICK:
We know what you did.

1729
01:19:34.649 --> 01:19:35.817
NATE:
Okay.

1730
01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:36.985
With all due respect.
I have no idea

1731
01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:38.153
what you guys are talking about.

1732
01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:39.237
NICK:
Maybe you don't.

1733
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:42.032
But right now.
there are two assholes

1734
01:19:42.073 --> 01:19:44.200
saying you do.

1735
01:19:44.242 --> 01:19:46.911
There's no need for us to
bluff.
We don't have a smoking gun.

1736
01:19:46.953 --> 01:19:49.622
But as my esteemed colleague
has no doubt informed you.

1737
01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:51.291
we've got the bullets.
the casings.

1738
01:19:51.332 --> 01:19:54.044
and the goddamn forensic report.

1739
01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:58.631
The whole story tied in a bow.
just waiting for the proof

1740
01:19:58.673 --> 01:20:00.383
that you knew about it.

1741
01:20:01.926 --> 01:20:06.014
If we do decide to print.
you got every news outlet

1742
01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:09.434
in the country
on a scavenger hunt for proof

1743
01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:11.853
of your involvement.

1744
01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:13.355
There is no proof
of my involvement.

1745
01:20:14.939 --> 01:20:16.441
The allegation itself knocks
you
out of the White House.

1746
01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:18.193
You'll spend the next few years
in court.

1747
01:20:19.152 --> 01:20:20.862
And if you did know.

1748
01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:22.572
the next couple of decades
in prison.

1749
01:20:23.948 --> 01:20:27.202
So. the way I see it.
if you want any hope

1750
01:20:27.243 --> 01:20:31.247
of reversing this unfortunate
chain of events.

1751
01:20:31.289 --> 01:20:34.459
you will tell us
the God's honest truth

1752
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:36.544
right here and now.

1753
01:20:37.587 --> 01:20:38.505
Okay. Uh--

1754
01:20:38.546 --> 01:20:41.383
But before you do.

1755
01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:45.178
a disclaimer.

1756
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.597
I've worked in this town
for 52 years.

1757
01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:52.352
That makes me one
of the world's foremost experts

1758
01:20:52.394 --> 01:20:54.604
at spotting a liar.

1759
01:20:54.646 --> 01:20:57.899
Lie to me. and you lose...

1760
01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:01.986
the election and your freedom.

1761
01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:06.408
But lucky for you.

1762
01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:10.578
the truth may still set you
free
because believe it or not.

1763
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:14.582
I'm still grappling
with a truly punishing question.

1764
01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:17.335
Is it worth it?

1765
01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:21.297
(***)

1766
01:21:27.345 --> 01:21:28.263
I don't have a party war chest.

1767
01:21:28.304 --> 01:21:29.097
Okay?

1768
01:21:31.224 --> 01:21:32.267
This thing
was just a temporary fix

1769
01:21:32.308 --> 01:21:34.060
to get me to the starting line.

1770
01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:35.395
We were gonna give it all back
as soon as we're in a position

1771
01:21:35.437 --> 01:21:36.479
to do so.

1772
01:21:39.274 --> 01:21:40.692
This is no harm. no foul.
It's victimless.

1773
01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:41.693
Tell that to the class

1774
01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:43.945
of invisible kids
in West Virginia.

1775
01:21:46.197 --> 01:21:48.033
I don't know.

1776
01:21:48.074 --> 01:21:48.950
How do we make this okay? Huh?

1777
01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:53.538
First interview
after I'm sworn in.

1778
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.166
Exclusives for eight years
after that.

1779
01:21:56.207 --> 01:21:57.709
If there's a leak
coming from the White House.

1780
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.544
you're the two pots catching
it.
You have my word!

1781
01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:03.548
Eli.

1782
01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:05.467
What about Penny?

1783
01:22:07.093 --> 01:22:08.595
You worry
for your sister's safety

1784
01:22:08.636 --> 01:22:10.597
every day
that she's serving overseas.

1785
01:22:10.638 --> 01:22:12.557
And with your father
undergoing chemotherapy...

1786
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.481
I can't imagine how hard
that must be.

1787
01:22:21.107 --> 01:22:22.359
And your sister. Penny. is it?

1788
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.486
Lieutenant Penelope James.

1789
01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:27.155
We can work out

1790
01:22:27.197 --> 01:22:29.574
an honorable discharge for her
the day I'm sworn in.

1791
01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:31.117
Your sister deserves
to be with your dad

1792
01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:32.160
during his treatments.

1793
01:22:33.536 --> 01:22:35.413
If I wasn't so inexperienced.

1794
01:22:36.706 --> 01:22:38.500
I would think you were using
a commissioned officer

1795
01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:40.377
as collateral in a bribe.

1796
01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:47.676
I would more call it
an agreement amongst friends.

1797
01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:50.512
Look. I feel for you. Eli.

1798
01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:53.807
[sighs softly]

1799
01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:56.017
Cancer took my mom.

1800
01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:58.269
And the emotional toll is hard.

1801
01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:00.271
But the treatments add up.

1802
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:03.358
And until we can get in there
and reform

1803
01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.236
the healthcare system.
I don't want your parents

1804
01:23:06.277 --> 01:23:08.029
to be crushed under the weight
of medical bills.

1805
01:23:09.614 --> 01:23:11.324
And we can make sure
that doesn't happen.

1806
01:23:12.534 --> 01:23:14.369
We are on the same team here.

1807
01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:17.706
And if you wanna make real.
lasting change.

1808
01:23:17.747 --> 01:23:20.667
well. you just gotta play
the game.

1809
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:21.751
and that's the reality of it.

1810
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:26.798
You were supposed to change
the game.

1811
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:35.765
(***)

1812
01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:53.783
(***)

1813
01:23:55.201 --> 01:23:57.829
I had a hunch I'd find you here.

1814
01:23:57.871 --> 01:23:59.497
ELI:
I'm getting it all down.

1815
01:23:59.539 --> 01:24:01.541
Everything that crooked.
fucking conman's done.

1816
01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:03.793
We don't have enough to publish.

1817
01:24:03.835 --> 01:24:05.503
[sighs]

1818
01:24:05.545 --> 01:24:08.131
-But he just admitted--
-Unless we find hard evidence

1819
01:24:08.173 --> 01:24:12.177
that Sterling himself knew.
we're just a couple of trees

1820
01:24:12.218 --> 01:24:13.678
falling in the woods.

1821
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.679
So. what do we do now?

1822
01:24:16.097 --> 01:24:17.182
NICK:
Tear it all up.

1823
01:24:17.223 --> 01:24:19.142
Everything we know.

1824
01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:21.436
I'll track Sterling to his
rally
in Atlanta.

1825
01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:25.440
and see if we can crack
the safe.

1826
01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:34.449
(***)

1827
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:52.467
(***)

1828
01:25:01.267 --> 01:25:03.645
ELI:
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

1829
01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:06.147
I'm calling the police.

1830
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:07.482
They-- they trashed
my apartment!

1831
01:25:09.818 --> 01:25:12.195
[pants]

1832
01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:14.197
-What are you doing here?
-Thank God you're okay.

1833
01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:16.741
-I looked everywhere.
-No. Get out. Lucas.

1834
01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:19.285
-HAL: Eli. calm down.
sweetheart--
-ELI: Daddy.

1835
01:25:19.327 --> 01:25:21.371
-HAL: Lucas told us.
-No. Okay?

1836
01:25:21.413 --> 01:25:22.831
Don't believe a word
that he has to say. Okay?

1837
01:25:24.457 --> 01:25:24.499
NATE (ON RECORDING):
This thing was just
a temporary fix

1838
01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:25.458
to get me to the starting line.

1839
01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:26.376
We're gonna give it all back

1840
01:25:27.627 --> 01:25:27.669
as soon as we're in a position
to do so.

1841
01:25:29.754 --> 01:25:31.506
This is no harm. no foul.
It's victimless!

1842
01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:33.008
ELI (ON RECORDING):
Tell that to the class
of invisible...

1843
01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:33.883
[gasps]

1844
01:25:36.386 --> 01:25:37.429
Oh. my God.

1845
01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:40.390
Did Nick know?

1846
01:25:40.432 --> 01:25:42.183
LUCAS:
No.

1847
01:25:42.225 --> 01:25:43.393
He still doesn't.

1848
01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:46.771
I had to commit. or his face
would have given me away.

1849
01:25:48.356 --> 01:25:50.400
And honestly.
I didn't decide to do it

1850
01:25:50.442 --> 01:25:52.193
until I was standing
outside of the office.

1851
01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:58.992
[sighs]

1852
01:25:59.034 --> 01:26:01.411
You know.
this doesn't fix everything.

1853
01:26:01.453 --> 01:26:02.662
LUCAS:
I know.

1854
01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:04.205
I needed you to be wrong.

1855
01:26:06.916 --> 01:26:07.876
I love you.

1856
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:11.588
It's all I got.

1857
01:26:13.298 --> 01:26:14.257
[sighs]

1858
01:26:16.009 --> 01:26:17.761
I need to tell Nick.

1859
01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:20.472
He's on his way
to Sterling's rally right now.

1860
01:26:20.513 --> 01:26:21.598
I'm flying with the campaign.

1861
01:26:21.639 --> 01:26:23.266
I'll track him down
and tell him.

1862
01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:24.851
-You go work on your story.
-I'll just call him.

1863
01:26:24.893 --> 01:26:26.227
LUCAS:
That might be difficult.

1864
01:26:26.269 --> 01:26:27.312
The last time I saw
Nick's phone.

1865
01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:29.647
it was floating
in Sterling's coffee.

1866
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:30.648
[sighs]

1867
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.234

Hey.

1878
01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:56.758
Did you find him?

1879
01:26:57.884 --> 01:26:59.052

1884
01:27:10.647 --> 01:27:11.898
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
Nothing?

1885
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.359
It's like a zoo with no cages.

1886
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:17.487
CORRESPONDENT 18:

1894
01:27:36.339 --> 01:27:37.298

The election is a dead heat.

JANE:
If it's anything

1906
01:28:03.241 --> 01:28:04.993
like the last two elections.
it could come down

1907
01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:07.370
to a few thousand votes
in a handful of swing states.

1908
01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:11.875

a few hundred votes.

by a few million.

1910
01:28:14.711 --> 01:28:16.087
Your readers
really listen to you.

1911
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:17.380
They trust you.

1912
01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:18.840
I call it like I see it.

1913
01:28:18.882 --> 01:28:19.883
What do you see here?

1914
01:28:23.678 --> 01:28:25.930

[chuckles]

1918
01:28:56.211 --> 01:29:00.006
Well. I have good news
and bad news.

1919
01:29:00.048 --> 01:29:01.591
Which do you want first?

1920
01:29:01.633 --> 01:29:02.884
SUPPORTER (ON TV):
The bad!

1921
01:29:02.926 --> 01:29:03.968
NATE (ON TV)
Right!

1922
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:06.888
Okay. here it is.

1923
01:29:08.598 --> 01:29:11.851
My little girl
turned 21 yesterday.

1924
01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:15.063
And the first thing Alison did
was make sure

1925
01:29:15.105 --> 01:29:16.940
her voter registration
was current.

1926
01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:18.733
[crowd cheering]

1927
01:29:21.778 --> 01:29:22.737
Hello.

1928
01:29:23.863 --> 01:29:25.407
No. No. no. no. no.
Slow down.

1929
01:29:31.496 --> 01:29:32.455
Okay.

1930
01:29:33.748 --> 01:29:34.749
Okay.

1932
01:29:52.809 --> 01:29:56.771
(***)

1933
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.235
...And the other just sits
on its hands

1934
01:30:02.277 --> 01:30:03.194
and whines about it.

1935
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:09.784
'Cause Alison deserves better.

1936
01:30:09.826 --> 01:30:12.787
Our young people deserve better.

1937
01:30:12.829 --> 01:30:14.831
They deserve to look
forward to the future

1938
01:30:14.873 --> 01:30:19.085
the way we used to with hope.
with pride. with excitement.

1939
01:30:19.127 --> 01:30:20.086
Holy shit.

1940
01:30:20.128 --> 01:30:21.087
GORDON:
"Holy shit" what?

1941
01:30:21.129 --> 01:30:25.091
(***)

1942
01:30:26.134 --> 01:30:27.135
Holy...

1943
01:30:28.178 --> 01:30:28.928
This is unreal.

1944
01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:43.818
LUCAS:
Oh. Hey. Lynn. I got it.

1945
01:30:46.279 --> 01:30:47.655
[sighs]

1946
01:30:52.202 --> 01:30:55.080
So sorry for your loss.
Mrs. James.

1947
01:30:55.121 --> 01:30:56.706
LYNN:
Thank you.

1948
01:30:56.748 --> 01:30:59.626
And thank you for being so good
to my daughter.

1949
01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:02.712
You and your husband have
raised
a fine young woman.

1950
01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:12.263
Let's...

1951
01:31:12.305 --> 01:31:14.015
How fast can you finish
the story?

1952
01:31:17.936 --> 01:31:19.521
I'm about to bury my dad.

1953
01:31:23.191 --> 01:31:24.609
Maybe you should just take over.

1954
01:31:25.985 --> 01:31:28.113
It's your story.

1955
01:31:28.154 --> 01:31:30.865
You found it. You pushed it.
You're writing it.

1956
01:31:33.535 --> 01:31:36.037
And if we're doing it.
we gotta be quick.

1957
01:31:36.079 --> 01:31:37.831
We've got 24 hours. tops.

1958
01:31:38.873 --> 01:31:40.792
And it's gotta be airtight.

1959
01:31:41.876 --> 01:31:43.044
I'll take care of the rest.

1960
01:31:45.296 --> 01:31:46.214
And...

1961
01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:50.719
I'm sorry about your father.

1962
01:32:07.777 --> 01:32:09.279
Hello. Eli.

1963
01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.572
ELI (OVER PHONE):
Nick and I have a story

1964
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:12.741
ready for publication
that just might decide

1965
01:32:13.908 --> 01:32:15.160
the next president
of the United States.

1966
01:32:15.201 --> 01:32:17.037
Is that so?

1967
01:32:17.078 --> 01:32:18.705
Should I be worried?

1968
01:32:18.747 --> 01:32:21.207
Why do you wanna be president.
Senator Turnbull?

1969
01:32:22.334 --> 01:32:23.835
TURNBULL (OVER PHONE):
Look. Eli.

1970
01:32:23.877 --> 01:32:27.380
I assume we don't agree
on most policy.

1971
01:32:27.422 --> 01:32:30.633
But one thing we do both value
is the truth.

1972
01:32:30.675 --> 01:32:32.719
So. I'm gonna give you mine.

1973
01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:36.056
Right now. I am running
as the leader of my party.

1974
01:32:36.097 --> 01:32:37.891
but should
I be fortunate enough

1975
01:32:37.932 --> 01:32:39.976
to take that oath
on January 20.

1976
01:32:41.019 --> 01:32:44.314
I will be governing
as the leader of my country.

1977
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:48.026
Our democracy is fragile.

1978
01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:52.906
You protect it from the outside
by doing what you do.

1979
01:32:52.947 --> 01:32:55.158
And if I get the chance.
I'm going to protect it

1980
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.787
from the inside
with everything I've got.

1981
01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:01.289
ELI:
And off the record?

1982
01:33:04.167 --> 01:33:05.168
Take care. Eli.

1989
01:34:28.209 --> 01:34:29.502
I don't understand.

1990
01:34:29.544 --> 01:34:32.088
What's-- what's so special
about this one?

1991
01:34:36.134 --> 01:34:37.260
LYNN:
The day you were born.

1992
01:34:40.972 --> 01:34:41.931
[sighs]

1993
01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.478
I never got to say goodbye.

1994
01:34:48.063 --> 01:34:50.482
We thought it was another
false alarm from the chemo.

1995
01:34:52.984 --> 01:34:55.195
He knew that you were
at the Chronicle. writing.

1996
01:34:55.236 --> 01:34:56.780
[sighs]

1997
01:34:56.821 --> 01:34:58.031
LYNN:
He insisted

1998
01:34:58.073 --> 01:34:59.908
that that was where you needed
to be.

1999
01:35:02.952 --> 01:35:04.746
He loved you.

2000
01:35:07.332 --> 01:35:08.917
He's so proud.

2001
01:35:12.337 --> 01:35:13.338

2004
01:35:25.141 --> 01:35:26.101
Daddy.

2005
01:35:26.142 --> 01:35:35.110
(***)

2006
01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:39.322
Okay.

[phone rings]

2012
01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:25.452
KEVIN (OVER CELLPHONE):
Where are you?

2013
01:36:25.493 --> 01:36:27.370
-Kevin?
-Hey. where are you?

2014
01:36:27.412 --> 01:36:28.538
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
I'm at my parents' house.

2015
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.956
All right.

2016
01:36:29.998 --> 01:36:30.498
Meet me at the diner
on 4th and Delaware

2017
01:36:31.249 --> 01:36:32.417
in 20 minutes. All right?

2018
01:36:34.210 --> 01:36:34.252
-I'm not doing that.
-KEVIN (OVER CELLPHONE): It's an
emergency.

2019
01:36:34.919 --> 01:36:34.961
What is this about?

2020
01:36:35.587 --> 01:36:36.296
Look. I was fired.

2021
01:36:36.338 --> 01:36:37.255
Why?

2022
01:36:37.297 --> 01:36:38.882
Because I-- I know the names.

2023
01:36:38.923 --> 01:36:41.259
Tom Mayfield. Dean Clifton.
and Spencer Erickson.

2024
01:36:46.181 --> 01:36:47.974
[indistinct chatter]

2025
01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:53.480
How the fuck do you know
those names?

2026
01:36:53.521 --> 01:36:55.315
The-- the um-- the other night

2027
01:36:55.357 --> 01:36:58.026
when you got that call
and you left in a hurry.

2028
01:36:59.611 --> 01:37:03.573
well. you didn't log out.
And Gordon assumed it was mine.

2029
01:37:05.325 --> 01:37:08.495
Look. I didn't say anything.
'cause I was in shock

2030
01:37:08.536 --> 01:37:10.246
and Gordon flipped for it.

2031
01:37:10.288 --> 01:37:11.289
I thought I'd be waking up
to a headline

2032
01:37:12.415 --> 01:37:13.375
that would change
the course of history.

2033
01:37:14.584 --> 01:37:15.627
So. why did I instead wake up
to an email

2034
01:37:17.212 --> 01:37:18.129
informing me that the Chronicle
was terminating my contract?

2035
01:37:18.838 --> 01:37:19.339
I mean. I rushed to the office.

2036
01:37:20.715 --> 01:37:21.091
and security wouldn't even
let me in the building.

2037
01:37:22.258 --> 01:37:23.927
Apparently. Gordon had HR
clean out my desk

2038
01:37:23.968 --> 01:37:25.178
and wipe my desktop.

2039
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.097
Gordon killed the story
to save his own ass.

2040
01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:30.517
-Why-- why would he--
- ELI: Jack Hampton.

2041
01:37:30.558 --> 01:37:32.519
He's a huge Sterling supporter.

2042
01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.520
Gordon prints the story.

2043
01:37:34.604 --> 01:37:35.063
Hampton orders
his head on a platter.

2044
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:37.357
Gordon kills the story.
Sterling wins.

2045
01:37:37.399 --> 01:37:38.525
Guess which paper
has a direct line

2046
01:37:38.566 --> 01:37:39.526
to the Oval Office.

2047
01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:45.281
So. Gordon is playing politics

2048
01:37:45.323 --> 01:37:47.992
dirtier
than the goddamn politicians?

2049
01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:51.371
[scoffs]

2050
01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:57.419
Please nail that motherfucker.

2051
01:37:58.503 --> 01:37:59.587
I can't believe

2052
01:37:59.629 --> 01:38:01.006
you let Gordon think
it was your story.

2053
01:38:03.216 --> 01:38:06.594
Look. I never said that it was.

2054
01:38:06.636 --> 01:38:08.972
And as it turns out.
I did you a favor.

2055
01:38:10.557 --> 01:38:12.559
So. you're welcome. Hmm?

2056
01:38:19.607 --> 01:38:21.109
No. Eli. I got it. Please.

2057
01:38:22.235 --> 01:38:23.236
You're unemployed.

2058
01:38:23.278 --> 01:38:25.280
It wouldn't be right. Prick.

2059
01:38:30.952 --> 01:38:32.120
Have you shown Gordon the story?

2060
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:33.204
NICK (OVER CELLPHONE):
I'm waiting for you.

2061
01:38:34.539 --> 01:38:34.581
You should get to see
the look on his face.

2062
01:38:35.874 --> 01:38:36.708
-Where the fuck are you?
-I'm on my way.

2063
01:38:37.792 --> 01:38:39.085
Whatever you do.
don't talk to Gordon.

2064
01:38:43.089 --> 01:38:45.467
And I thought I'd seen it all.

2065
01:38:50.388 --> 01:38:51.389
We're doing this?

2066
01:38:51.431 --> 01:38:53.016
[chuckles]

2067
01:38:54.309 --> 01:38:56.227
ELI:
What?

2068
01:38:56.269 --> 01:38:58.563
The weight of the world
lies in the palm of my hand.

2069
01:38:58.605 --> 01:39:00.482
I guess I thought
it'd be a bit heavier.

2070
01:39:01.566 --> 01:39:03.318
[chuckles softly]

2071
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.072
You know what this means
if we go through with this.

2072
01:39:11.534 --> 01:39:13.161
And you're willing?

2073
01:39:13.203 --> 01:39:16.206
I guess that's why they call it
the moment of truth.

2074
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.001
It's your story.

2075
01:39:23.296 --> 01:39:24.673
What?

2076
01:39:24.714 --> 01:39:27.592
No. I-- I stumbled upon it.
yeah. but you guided me.

2077
01:39:30.762 --> 01:39:32.806
If you hadn't have gotten me
that interview

2078
01:39:32.847 --> 01:39:35.600
-at Meyers & Goldstein--
-You would have gotten it
in some other way.

2079
01:39:35.642 --> 01:39:36.685
I doubted you.

2080
01:39:38.395 --> 01:39:40.397
You fought through the doubt.

2081
01:39:40.438 --> 01:39:41.523
You took me for the ride.

2082
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:45.610
I didn't provide anything
that you didn't already--

2083
01:39:45.652 --> 01:39:47.362
You can now.

2084
01:39:47.404 --> 01:39:48.196
What?

2085
01:39:48.238 --> 01:39:49.239
Credibility.

2086
01:39:50.532 --> 01:39:52.742
Sterling was right.
Nobody knows my name.

2087
01:39:52.784 --> 01:39:56.329
And those that do
aren't so fond of it.

2088
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:58.289
If I were to publish this
on my own.

2089
01:39:58.331 --> 01:40:01.543
it wouldn't get any traction.
Or worse. it'll get dismissed.

2090
01:40:03.253 --> 01:40:06.715
But coming from Nicholas
Booker.
it'll be on every front page

2091
01:40:06.756 --> 01:40:08.591
and television network
in minutes.

2092
01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:11.386
We need to do this together.

2093
01:40:12.804 --> 01:40:15.390
And after we break the story.
we can set up our own shop.

2094
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.227
No editor or parent corporation

2095
01:40:19.269 --> 01:40:21.521
to tell us what
we can and can't print.

2096
01:40:21.563 --> 01:40:25.525
A publication that answers
to nothing but the facts.

2097
01:40:25.567 --> 01:40:26.568
wherever they lead.

2098
01:40:28.611 --> 01:40:29.654
What would we call it?

2099
01:40:32.198 --> 01:40:33.116
The Independent.

2100
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:37.787
The Independent.

2101

2109
01:41:49.651 --> 01:41:50.735
Now. what?

2110
01:41:51.986 --> 01:41:53.321
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

2111
01:41:55.323 --> 01:41:56.783
And go where?

2112
01:41:56.825 --> 01:41:58.785
Watch the fireworks
from the hill.

2113

2114

50 years. Gordon.

2118
01:42:39.325 --> 01:42:40.702
I didn't know you had it in you.

2119
01:42:44.956 --> 01:42:49.294
I was just trying to protect
everyone in here.

2120
01:42:49.336 --> 01:42:52.839
And I'm just trying to protect
everyone out there.

Take care. Gordon.

01:43:07.854 --> 01:43:09.439
Think they'll read this one
in West Virginia?

2124
01:43:11.733 --> 01:43:12.692
Hmm.

when I was in school *

2134
