319
00:15:46.672 --> 00:15:49.112
but being fat was bad.

320
00:15:49.147 --> 00:15:51.114
and I think he thought
me being bigger

321
00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:54.150
would limit my chances
of having a good life

322
00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:57.285
and succeeding and doing well.

323
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.042
I actually ended up
with an eating disorder.

324
00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.759
which lasted
for about six years.

325
00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:13.037
so I suffered terribly
from binge-eating disorder.

326
00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.402
and that was closely linked
with body dysmorphia.

327
00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:19.571
so I had in my mind that
I needed to look a certain way.

328
00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:21.111
I was kind of placing
my happiness

329
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.640
in something external.

330
00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:25.478
and it just led to very extreme
food style behaviors.

331
00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:28.679
so having come
from a good relationship

332
00:16:28.714 --> 00:16:30.351
with food growing up.

333
00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:34.091
it soon went south
very. very quickly.

334
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.528
Think of bigorexia
like reverse anorexia.

335
00:16:42.563 --> 00:16:45.564
Instead of people
who really want to be thin

336
00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:48.666
and desperately want
to lose weight.

337
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:51.636
you have predominantly young men

338
00:16:51.671 --> 00:16:54.045
who want to be more muscular.

339
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.180
and the sort of diet
and training

340
00:16:57.215 --> 00:16:59.215
that they involve
themselves with

341
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.415
are geared toward
becoming more muscular.

342
00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:07.586
Muscle dysmorphia is
not dangerous. per se.

343
00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:10.424
but it is debilitating.
and that's different.

344
00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:12.756
People who have
really high levels of anxiety

345
00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:14.230
are debilitated by it.

346
00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:15.759
Like. it can ruin their life.

347
00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:19.301
And we see a similar thing
with muscle dysmorphia.

348
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.734
Are you an idiot?

349
00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:26.308
What is this?

350
00:17:26.343 --> 00:17:29.278
You'd better do
your dancing again.

351
00:17:29.313 --> 00:17:33.546
I think it is celebrating
a disordered behavior

352
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:35.647
in relationship with food.

353
00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:39.090
and it's an attempt
to legitimize that behavior

354
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:41.389

703
00:34:54.654 --> 00:35:00.559
I can't be... I'm not allowed
to be sexy because I'm fat.

704
00:35:00.594 --> 00:35:01.493

and you want me

705
00:35:01.529 --> 00:35:02.803

706
00:35:02.827 --> 00:35:03.827
you look at me weird.

707
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.828
That's crazy.

708
00:35:05.863 --> 00:35:09.139
I can't be happy and fat
at the same time.

709
00:35:09.174 --> 00:35:11.768
I should wear curtains
all the time.

710
00:35:11.803 --> 00:35:12.869
I should cover myself up.

711
00:35:12.904 --> 00:35:16.707
That's kind of the stigma
that I feel every day.

712
00:35:16.742 --> 00:35:18.841
I need to pee. I'm desperate.

713
00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:21.646
so I might go into a McDonald's.

714
00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:24.451
But I would rather hold my pee

715
00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:27.256
and cause myself internal pain

716
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.456
than face some kind of ridicule
in McDonald's

717
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:30.657
just 'cause I need to pee.

00:35:30.692 --> 00:35:34.197
I'm not here to eat a Big Mac.
burgers. chicken wings.

719
00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.506

I don't want any of that.

720
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.244
I just want to pee.
but I get really scared

721
00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:40.302
to go inside.

722
00:35:45.738 --> 00:35:48.310
Individuals who experience
weight stigma

723
00:35:48.345 --> 00:35:51.412
and have higher rates of
internalized weight stigma.

724
00:35:51.447 --> 00:35:54.745
they experience more anxiety
and depression.

725
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.880
disordered eating.
body dissatisfaction.

726
00:35:57.915 --> 00:36:01.323
And it's such a problem that
the World Health Organization

727
00:36:01.358 --> 00:36:04.326
has called it
a serious health concern.

728
00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.596
Shoreditch High Street Station.

729
00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:16.404
I would argue that
diet culture wouldn't exist

730
00:36:16.439 --> 00:36:17.537
without fat phobia.

731
00:36:17.572 --> 00:36:20.342
If we weren't fearful
of being fat.

732
00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:22.707
the diet industry doesn't
have a leg to stand on.

733
00:36:22.742 --> 00:36:24.280
Why would you want
to lose weight

734
00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:25.545
if there wasn't a problem

735
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.217
with being fat
in the first place?

736
00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.911
Or it wouldn't be as profitable

737
00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:31.221
if we didn't subscribe
to that idea

738
00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:32.948
that being fat is bad

739
00:36:32.983 --> 00:36:34.851
and if we had
that fear around it.

740
00:36:34.886 --> 00:36:37.920
and I think it's important
to say that

741
00:36:37.955 --> 00:36:40.989
the diet industry is fueled
by that fear.

742
00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.628
and yet it doesn't work.

743
00:36:42.663 --> 00:36:45.268
We know diets
don't work long-term.

744
00:36:48.702 --> 00:36:50.372
I had a really genuine.

746
00:36:51.771 --> 00:36:55.003
to have to experience that
ever again."

747
00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:56.642
and it was a fuel.

748
00:36:56.677 --> 00:36:59.645
it was a fuel
to want to stay small

749
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.287
and keep the privilege
that I was suddenly granted.

750
00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.487
I could move around in medicine

751

in the same way.

753
00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:20.501
What I would say is
it took a very long time

754
00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:22.701
for the GP to take it seriously.

755
00:37:22.736 --> 00:37:25.605
It took the best part of nine.

756
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.277
10 months. something like that.

757
00:37:27.312 --> 00:37:29.378
but I remember
shouting at the GP

758
00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.490
saying. you know. "You've just
got to do something."

759
00:37:31.514 --> 00:37:34.042
And she said. "Your daughter
needs to come in on her own."

760
00:37:34.077 --> 00:37:35.176
Well. I thought. come on...

761
00:37:35.212 --> 00:37:36.825
- And that's the problem.
- Completely illogical.

762
00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:37.960
She can't come in on her own.

763
00:37:37.984 --> 00:37:40.752
That's the problem
with the way the system works

764
00:37:40.787 --> 00:37:43.557
is that I may have lost weight.

765
00:37:43.592 --> 00:37:45.988
but I wasn't at a critical BMI

766
00:37:46.023 --> 00:37:50.960
for the GP to take it
seriously enough.

767
00:37:50.995 --> 00:37:56.372
We've had BMI become
the dominant indicator

768
00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:59.067
through which
someone's health is assessed.

769
00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:01.674
BMI was originally designed
as a tool

770
00:38:01.709 --> 00:38:05.579
to broadly be applied
at the population level.

771
00:38:05.614 --> 00:38:08.615
It was never intended
that it would be used

772
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.750
to diagnose an individual.

773
00:38:12.918 --> 00:38:15.358
It really did...

774
00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.525
So the longer it took
to get treatment.

775
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.428
the worse
the eating disorder got

776
00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:21.826
and the further
down the slope I fell.

777
00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:24.059
and I think... I obviously
didn't see it at the time.

778
00:38:24.094 --> 00:38:26.699
At the time. I was quite happy
to not go to the GP

one of the main differences is

787
00:39:03.903 --> 00:39:06.508
there's fast food everywhere.

788
00:39:06.543 --> 00:39:09.643

792
00:39:18.148 --> 00:39:22.425
the thick one that gets you
addicted really quickly.

793
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.461
And also. there's
a couple of restaurants

794
00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:29.531
that are basically takeout only.
which is interesting.

795
00:39:29.566 --> 00:39:30.994
So what I think it is

796
00:39:31.029 --> 00:39:33.634
is that people enjoy
having the food

797
00:39:33.669 --> 00:39:35.163
in the comfort
of their own home.

798
00:39:35.198 --> 00:39:38.936
but they don't want to cook.

799
00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:42.478
But it is certainly something
that struck me as odd.

800
00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:50.453
Here in the UK.
I work in the night shift.

801
00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:53.423
so I come home
around 6:30 in the morning

802
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:55.656
and I will have had lunch
at midnight.

803
00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:57.493
so usually I'm very hungry.

804
00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.088
but I'm also very tired.

805
00:39:59.123 --> 00:40:00.925
So when I have a big meal.

806
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.861
which other people
consider breakfast

807
00:40:02.896 --> 00:40:05.061
for me is dinner.

808
00:40:05.096 --> 00:40:08.801
that will then be
right before I go to bed.

809
00:40:08.836 --> 00:40:13.069
From what I've read
and what we think.

810
00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:14.906
that then goes
straight onto your hips

811
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:17.645
and is very. very unhealthy.

812
00:40:25.182 --> 00:40:26.081

813
00:40:26.117 --> 00:40:28.183
"Oh. you need
to stop eating junk food."

814
00:40:28.218 --> 00:40:31.120
and it was like
a couple of remarks

815
00:40:31.155 --> 00:40:33.056
on videos I've made prior.

816
00:40:38.129 --> 00:40:40.635
Like. you're not paying for me.

817
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.802
Like. if you're taking me out
and you're paying

818
00:40:42.837 --> 00:40:44.133
and I'm ordering a bit too much

819
00:40:44.168 --> 00:40:45.244

getting a bit much.

820
00:40:45.268 --> 00:40:46.367
yeah. say something.

821
00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:51.844
but if it's my hard-earned cash
that I'm spending.

822
00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:53.153
it's got nothing to do with you.

823

826
00:41:02.186 --> 00:41:04.725

considered unhealthy.

827
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.794
immediately
the judgmental part kicks in.

828
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:09.664
You say. "Oh. they shouldn't
be eating this."

829
00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:11.633

"Oh. where this is going.

00:41:11.668 --> 00:41:13.899
it's going to be
in good company."

831

thin privilege.

as small as I am now.

842

but I was just heading into
that really restrictive phase.

843
00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:50.738
and the man behind the till

844
00:41:50.773 --> 00:41:52.971

Regardless of whether
I'd eaten the cake or not.

859

those judgments about me.

Thin privilege is something
I've enjoyed for a long time.

to physically look up to me.

00:43:16.386 --> 00:43:18.991
cisgendered white woman
who is thin.

876
00:43:19.026 --> 00:43:20.993
and I receive
a lot of privilege.

877
00:43:21.028 --> 00:43:22.896
but actually my body
is very different

878
00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:24.733
to a lot of people's.
and I'm like.

879
00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:27.296
you should physically
have to live in my body.

880
00:43:27.331 --> 00:43:31.036
because I feel ill all the time.

881
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.104
and my blood results
are terrible.

882
00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:34.809
and I'm horribly anemic.

883
00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:37.779
and there's absolutely nothing
I can do about any of it.

884
00:43:37.814 --> 00:43:41.277
And you think I look well
because I've put some makeup on

885
00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:43.147
and because I'm thin?

886
00:43:48.957 --> 00:43:50.121
It's become something

887
00:43:50.156 --> 00:43:52.189
that has become
a bit of an identity.

888
00:43:52.224 --> 00:43:54.961
And so our weight
has become our identity.

889
00:43:54.996 --> 00:43:56.897
and so we're less good
of a person

890
00:43:56.932 --> 00:43:58.360
if we're not thin.

891
00:43:58.395 --> 00:44:00.835
We deserve less.
we have less self-esteem.

892
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.397
All these things
are well-documented

893
00:44:02.432 --> 00:44:05.268
as to the thought processes
that occur

894
00:44:05.303 --> 00:44:08.238
because of this thin ideal.

895
00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:13.914
The next train to arrive
at Platform 2

896
00:44:13.949 --> 00:44:18.688
in two minutes will be
service to all stations...

897
00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.890
And again. I'm like.
I'm so scared to go into KFC.

898
00:44:22.925 --> 00:44:24.727
because in my head.
they must be thinking.

899
00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:27.158
"Oh. fatty's here again.

900
00:44:27.193 --> 00:44:29.226
All the chicken wings
are gone. lads."

901
00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:31.360
That's what I feel.

902
00:44:31.395 --> 00:44:34.099
I am now believing
that my body is ugly

903
00:44:34.134 --> 00:44:35.837
and abusing it with food.

904
00:44:35.872 --> 00:44:40.204
so that's where health
should be spoken about.

905
00:44:40.239 --> 00:44:41.105
Not. "Oh. you're fat.

906
00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.372
you're gonna die
of a heart attack."

907
00:44:43.407 --> 00:44:48.080
How did we get here?

908
00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:49.851
I think a lot of people
think that

909
00:44:49.886 --> 00:44:51.820
anti-fat bias
just has to do with thinking

910
00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.965
that fat people aren't pretty
or something like that.

911
00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:54.821
And sure. I mean.

912
00:44:54.857 --> 00:44:56.891
the attractiveness standard
is real.

913
00:44:56.926 --> 00:45:01.126
but anti-fat bias extends
to so many sectors of life:

914
00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:03.865
education. college admissions.

915
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.461
the amount of scholarship funds
that students are given.

916
00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:09.871
In the justice system.
there's research that shows

917
00:45:09.906 --> 00:45:12.434
that jurors are far more likely
to convict somebody

918
00:45:12.469 --> 00:45:15.910
who is of a larger body
than a thin person.

919
00:45:15.945 --> 00:45:18.407
and they're also subject
to harsher sentences

920
00:45:18.442 --> 00:45:20.211
and longer prison times.

921
00:45:20.246 --> 00:45:23.214
which is really wild
when you think about it.

922
00:45:23.249 --> 00:45:24.853
It's much more than just.

923
00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.789
"I don't like the way
that person looks."

924
00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:29.759
It really affects
all areas of life.

925
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.145
Growing up. I...

926
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.378
It was always made
very clear to me

927
00:45:55.413 --> 00:45:57.787
that I stood out.

928
00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:01.153
and my weight could
potentially be a problem

929
00:46:01.188 --> 00:46:03.155
getting a boyfriend.

930
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.323
My mom made it very clear
that being overweight.

931
00:46:06.358 --> 00:46:09.194
I was never gonna
get a boyfriend.

932
00:46:09.229 --> 00:46:11.361
I've been crushing on guys
for a long time.

933
00:46:11.396 --> 00:46:13.132
and I never experienced. like.

934
00:46:13.167 --> 00:46:16.399
my boyfriends that I had
in Dominican.

935
00:46:16.434 --> 00:46:17.807
Weight what?

936
00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:19.534
Weight wasn't an issue.

938
00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:31.953
But here... oh. my God.

939
00:46:31.988 --> 00:46:33.482
they do come into
the relationship

940
00:46:33.517 --> 00:46:36.089
like. "Yeah. I love all of you."

941
00:46:36.124 --> 00:46:39.092
and I'm like. "Yeah.
and that's how it should be."

942
00:46:39.127 --> 00:46:41.930
but some people genuinely
they can't help it.

943
00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.426
that's just their personality.

944
00:46:43.461 --> 00:46:45.065
They've been conditioned
by society.

945
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.969
and they do have subaggressions.

946
00:46:48.004 --> 00:46:51.467
you know. towards fat bodies
and have fat phobia

947
00:46:51.502 --> 00:46:54.602
without actually saying
that they have fat phobia.

948
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:58.177
And if you get into
a little argument.

949
00:46:58.212 --> 00:47:01.576
guess what. if the argument
probably is about your car.

950
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.315
guess what. it might
come into your weight.

951
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.020
Why? Tell me why.

952
00:47:06.055 --> 00:47:07.055
Tell me why.

953
00:47:09.652 --> 00:47:15.491
I think dating in 2019.

954
00:47:15.526 --> 00:47:17.097
it's shit for everyone.

955
00:47:17.132 --> 00:47:19.033
Like. I'm not even gonna
put it on my weight.

956
00:47:19.068 --> 00:47:20.870
'cause the thing is.
it's not that I don't

957
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:23.631
get a lot of attention. I do...

958
00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:25.204
I mean. I live in London

959
00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:27.305
where nobody speaks
to one another.

960
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.406
so it's all on the internet.

961
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:33.080
And the thing is.
you do get guys who are there.

962
00:47:33.115 --> 00:47:36.182
and they wouldn't want
to take you out.

963
00:47:36.217 --> 00:47:39.383
but they wanna come over
for Netflix and chill.

964
00:47:39.418 --> 00:47:42.485
and always come to mine.
and just like.

965
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.553
I watch too many
true crime documentaries

966
00:47:44.588 --> 00:47:47.391
to know that
this is not gonna happen.

967
00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:57.566
We fetishize
this whole snap-back thing

968
00:47:57.601 --> 00:47:59.337
after having a kid.

969
00:47:59.372 --> 00:48:02.571
but most women don't.
and it really. really bugs me.

970
00:48:02.606 --> 00:48:05.607
Again. it's another thing
that I've sort of attached

971
00:48:05.642 --> 00:48:07.048
to having a child.

972
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:08.214
I'm scared to have a child.

973
00:48:08.249 --> 00:48:11.052
because I'm scared that...

974
00:48:11.087 --> 00:48:12.559
There's not...
I don't know exactly what

975
00:48:12.583 --> 00:48:14.616
I'm gonna snap back to!

976
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:17.025
Nothing snaps that much anyway.

977
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.292
so how. if I have a child...

978
00:48:20.327 --> 00:48:22.063
Will I still be pretty?

979
00:48:22.098 --> 00:48:25.330
Will I be ugly? I don't know!

980
00:48:29.666 --> 00:48:32.238
I think every time
I look in the mirror.

981
00:48:32.273 --> 00:48:33.679
I'm glad someone else
puts more effort

982
00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:35.373
into looking good than I do.

983
00:48:35.408 --> 00:48:36.485
Coming from
the male perspective.

984
00:48:36.509 --> 00:48:40.213
we consider women to be
the more beautiful gender.

985
00:48:40.248 --> 00:48:42.215
So we appreciate that.

986
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.053
But I would never force a woman

987
00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:48.320
to dress a certain way.
to eat a certain way

988
00:48:48.355 --> 00:48:51.455
to make her look different.

989
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:55.360
It is something that is
ingrained into our culture

990
00:48:55.395 --> 00:48:58.396
is that women need to look good.

991
00:48:58.431 --> 00:49:02.136
They need to wear makeup.
they need to do their hair.

992
00:49:04.569 --> 00:49:06.041
Do they need to do that?

993
00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.208
No. they do not need to do that.

994
00:49:08.243 --> 00:49:11.310
But it is much appreciated.

995
00:49:11.345 --> 00:49:12.652
The woman out there
that's been rated

996
00:49:12.676 --> 00:49:14.412
the ugliest person in the world.

997
00:49:14.447 --> 00:49:18.416
who the fuck told the people
doing the judging and assessing

998
00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:20.451
that they were beautiful
in the first place?

999

Media!

1000
00:49:22.488 --> 00:49:25.489
That's why we...
We need to defriend

1001
00:49:25.524 --> 00:49:29.592
some of these Caucasian
British men.

1002
00:49:29.627 --> 00:49:31.462
British. to be exact.

1003
00:49:31.497 --> 00:49:35.103
because they started
all the problems.

1004
00:49:40.473 --> 00:49:42.605
Diet culture does
disproportionately affect women

1005
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.377
more than men.
and there is an element

1006
00:49:45.412 --> 00:49:49.183
to diet culture coming
from a patriarchal society

1007
00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:52.219
where women are told
what they should look like.

1008
00:49:52.254 --> 00:49:54.782
And a lot of the time.
that has been from men.

1009
00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.619
And so I think
it's very appropriate

1010
00:49:56.654 --> 00:49:59.787
that feminism in general
touches on diet culture

1011
00:49:59.822 --> 00:50:02.229

1560
01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.758
And so the big rhetoric
either from government

1561
01:15:32.793 --> 01:15:36.762
or from food industry
is that. you know.

1562
01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:40.062
everyone just needs
to eat better.

1563
01:15:40.097 --> 01:15:43.197
But then we look at
the urban environments

1564
01:15:43.232 --> 01:15:45.034
and food deserts. and we see

1565
01:15:45.069 --> 01:15:48.268
that. actually.
all of the fast food chains

1566
01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:50.105
and the quick convenience foods.

1567
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.712
which are kind of lower
in minerals and nutrients

1568
01:15:52.747 --> 01:15:55.275
than kind of whole foods.

1569
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.948
are disproportionately in areas

1570
01:15:57.983 --> 01:16:01.347
of low economic advantage.

1571
01:16:01.382 --> 01:16:03.283
When you add other barriers in.

1572
01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:07.320
like increasing consumption
of energy away from the home.

1573
01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:09.828
lack of food preparation skills.

1574
01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:14.602
time is a huge barrier
for low socioeconomic families

1575
01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:18.100
because. often. there could be
single-parent households.

1576
01:16:18.135 --> 01:16:21.609
two jobs. and we have

1577
01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:24.040
all of these social
and economic barriers

1578
01:16:24.075 --> 01:16:25.712
that we're not talking about.

1579
01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:28.308
and unless we start
talking about those issues.

1580
01:16:28.343 --> 01:16:30.178

progress.

to "psh. psh. psh" together.

1584
01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:49.703

and Burger King adverts

1586

just organic then?

You... you know?

1596
01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:22.197
Not only is that
evidentially unsustainable.

1597
01:17:22.232 --> 01:17:25.332
I think it's morally
unsustainable now

1598
01:17:25.367 --> 01:17:28.236
to put personal responsibility
on people

1599
01:17:28.271 --> 01:17:30.678
without modifying
the environment in their favor

1600
01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:34.407
that allows them to take
any personal responsibility.

1601
01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:37.916
If we're really serious
about reversing

1602
01:17:37.951 --> 01:17:41.117
or reducing the burden
of chronic lifestyle disease.

1603
01:17:41.152 --> 01:17:43.955
we need to start viewing this
as a political issue.

1604
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:45.099
and we need to start viewing it

1605
01:17:45.123 --> 01:17:47.761
as the socioeconomic issue
that it is.

1606
01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:51.864
and we need to start looking

1607
01:17:51.899 --> 01:17:54.163
at that very high level
for solutions

1608
01:17:54.198 --> 01:17:56.935
because it's really
the only place

1609
01:17:56.970 --> 01:18:01.104
where hard answers are going
to come to hard questions.

1610
01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:03.975
And the real question
within that is.

1611
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.144
do we have political parties
that are brave enough

1612
01:18:08.179 --> 01:18:11.180
to take that step?

1613
01:18:11.215 --> 01:18:13.281
And that's a question
that I would not be

1614
01:18:13.316 --> 01:18:15.283
particularly confident on

1615
01:18:15.318 --> 01:18:18.990
in certainly the countries
that have embraced

1616
01:18:19.025 --> 01:18:22.290
the neoliberal economic model.

1617
01:18:22.325 --> 01:18:26.393
♪

1618
01:18:26.428 --> 01:18:30.100
What strikes me is the lack
of urgency about this.

1619
01:18:30.135 --> 01:18:32.201
that assimilation
and eradication.

1620
01:18:32.236 --> 01:18:33.840
This is what we're talking about

1621
01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:36.106
when we talk about...
When people are suggesting

1622
01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:38.009
weight correction
as the way forward.

1623
01:18:38.044 --> 01:18:40.407
Health at Every Size
is a concept

1624
01:18:40.442 --> 01:18:43.916
that was coined by Linda Bacon
and Lucy Aphramor.

1625
01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:45.412
and the best way to describe it

1626
01:18:45.447 --> 01:18:48.382
is that it's
a social justice movement

1627
01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:51.891
that's designed to creating
and delivering

1628
01:18:51.926 --> 01:18:55.829
inclusive and accessible care
for everybody.

1629
01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:59.459
So. I focus on body respect
and health gain.

1630
01:18:59.494 --> 01:19:01.868
where health gain
resides in justice.

1631
01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.805
If we want health.
we need a fair society.

1632
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.334
we need to talk about trauma.

1633
01:19:06.369 --> 01:19:08.435
we need to be
compassion-centered.

1634
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:11.141
And so how that translates
to working

1635
01:19:11.176 --> 01:19:14.045
as a Health at Every Size
practitioner. for example.

1636
01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.784
is I position my clients
as the experts

1637
01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:19.050
because they're the ones
that know what feels right

1638
01:19:19.085 --> 01:19:21.316
in their body.
they're the ones that know

1639
01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:25.188
what fits with their lives
in terms of healthcare.

1640
01:19:25.223 --> 01:19:27.927
But at the same time.
I'm also teaching them

1641
01:19:27.962 --> 01:19:30.996
that critical awareness
by bringing in research

1642
01:19:31.031 --> 01:19:32.998
and helping them
to really unpack

1643
01:19:33.033 --> 01:19:36.100
those internalized messages
from diet culture.

1644
01:19:36.135 --> 01:19:37.563
Vicious cycle.

1645
01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:40.566
Hundred percent vicious cycle.

1646
01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:43.437
I'm actually
really quite inspired

1647
01:19:43.472 --> 01:19:45.472
by the idea of intuitive eating.

1648
01:19:45.507 --> 01:19:49.949
I think it's something that
you have to be very careful

1649
01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:53.414
to kind of embark on
because it's very easy to say.

1650
01:19:53.449 --> 01:19:55.086
"Well. I'll eat intuitively."

1651
01:19:55.121 --> 01:19:57.550
but if you're still ruled
by assorted eating thoughts.

1652
01:19:57.585 --> 01:20:00.322
you may just not eat enough
or you may completely cut back

1653
01:20:00.357 --> 01:20:02.269
because you'll think
your body is saying one thing

1654
01:20:02.293 --> 01:20:03.457
when. really. your thoughts

1655
01:20:03.492 --> 01:20:05.525
have control over you. actually.

1656
01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.571
The thoughts
are saying something

1657
01:20:06.595 --> 01:20:09.364
and it's not your hunger
you're listening to.

1658
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:14.039
So. intuitive eating
is a framework

1659
01:20:14.074 --> 01:20:17.944
that is designed to get you
to reconnect with your body.

1660
01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.946
and it was developed
by Evelyn Tribole

1661
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.982
and Elyse Resch
in the mid-1990s.

1662
01:20:23.017 --> 01:20:25.182
And the reason why
it's so important right now

1663
01:20:25.217 --> 01:20:27.954
is because it's
a really radical concept

1664
01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:31.122
and a really radical framework
in diet culture.

1665
01:20:31.157 --> 01:20:33.927
where we're constantly
being bombarded with messages

1666
01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.193
about what to eat
and how to eat.

1667
01:20:36.228 --> 01:20:39.361
Intuitively eating teaches us
how to strip those back

1668
01:20:39.396 --> 01:20:42.870
and how to regain trust
in our bodies.

1669
01:20:48.339 --> 01:20:52.143
Jubilee Line. the next train
to Wembley Park

1670
01:20:52.178 --> 01:20:57.115
will depart from Platform 14
in one minute.

1671
01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.282
I'm just a secret...
I'm a secret eater

1672
01:20:59.317 --> 01:21:03.022
because I was so ashamed
to do it in public.

1673
01:21:03.057 --> 01:21:04.551
I reached a level of confidence

1674
01:21:04.586 --> 01:21:05.992
where I didn't really mind.

1675
01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.653
but it seems to have
disappeared again

1676
01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:09.358
and. now. even if I am
really hungry

1677
01:21:09.393 --> 01:21:11.624
and I do just want some chips
from McDonald's.

1678
01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:14.066
I just... I can't. I won't do it.

1679
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:16.530
I don't want to do it.
I feel bad.

1680
01:21:16.565 --> 01:21:20.633
even though everyone
has chips from. um.

1681
01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:22.206
has chips from McDonald's.

1682
01:21:27.246 --> 01:21:28.674
People always ask.

1683
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:32.018
"Well. if I improve
my relationship with food."

1684
01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.448
and one of those things
to do that

1685
01:21:33.483 --> 01:21:36.088
is giving yourself
unconditional permission

1686
01:21:36.123 --> 01:21:37.056
to eat all foods.

1687
01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:39.355
where nothing
is officially off the table.

1688
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:41.324
they go. "well.
I'm just gonna put weight on.

1689
01:21:41.359 --> 01:21:43.029
I'm just gonna keep
gaining weight.

1690
01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.427
I did that once. I tried
to give myself permission

1691
01:21:45.462 --> 01:21:47.528
and I just gained weight."

1692
01:21:47.563 --> 01:21:49.101
The difficulty is that

1693
01:21:49.136 --> 01:21:51.136
if you're giving yourself
permission.

1694
01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:54.139
but you still have an end goal
of weight loss.

1695
01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:57.604
then you don't really have
unconditional permission.

1696
01:21:57.639 --> 01:21:59.353
Everything that you do
is still conditional

1697
01:21:59.377 --> 01:22:00.981
on not gaining weight.

1698
01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:03.412
and it brings fear
back into the equation

1699
01:22:03.447 --> 01:22:05.480
because we're afraid
of gaining weight.

1700
01:22:05.515 --> 01:22:08.582
And when we're afraid.
we then restrict

1701
01:22:08.617 --> 01:22:11.453
because restriction
comes from fear.

1702
01:22:20.596 --> 01:22:23.663
We're diverse individuals.
we're complex creatures.

1703
01:22:23.698 --> 01:22:27.337
so we need a wide range
of things to help us cope.

1704
01:22:27.372 --> 01:22:30.637
However. some of the foods
that we use to cope

1705
01:22:30.672 --> 01:22:34.212
with our emotions
are vilified in diet culture.

1706
01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:35.983
I mean. when we're feeling sad
or upset.

1707
01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:39.085
we're not gonna go
for a plate of kale.

1708
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.581
We want to go
for a piece of cake.

1709

or we want to go for some pasta.

1710
01:22:42.486 --> 01:22:45.388
or we want to go for something
that. generally speaking.

1711
01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:47.225
gets vilified by diet culture

1712
01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.722
because it has sugar
or carbohydrates.

1713
01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:51.625
And there's so much
fearmongering

1714

around those kind of foods.

1715
01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:56.564
that when we then
go to reach for them.

1716
01:22:56.599 --> 01:23:01.008
when we're feeling emotional.
we experience shame and guilt.

are mediated through food.

1721
01:23:11.812 --> 01:23:13.779
And so that means
that. quite often.

1722
01:23:13.814 --> 01:23:16.485
food can help us to process

so what you trying to say?"

1800
01:26:51.603 --> 01:26:54.736
Being 18 stone.
I was technically obese.

1801
01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:56.276
I had very high blood pressure.

1802
01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.377

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:03.745
- Oh. goodness.
- And the GP told me

1805
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:04.922
that if I didn't change my ways

1806
01:27:04.946 --> 01:27:06.385

into fitness

not see my 60th birthday.

1809

Then he went on to speak
about weight loss

1810
01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.821

and said.

1811
01:27:13.856 --> 01:27:15.493
"Well. actually. fat loss.
