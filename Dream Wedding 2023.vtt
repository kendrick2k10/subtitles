00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:53.663
I had to.

179
00:08:53.794 --> 00:08:55.099
It said to.

180
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.231
I am going to kill you!

181
00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:58.146
I swear. nobody
will find your body.

182
00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:00.278
And no jury would convict me.

183
00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:01.541
A big day for Kate Wilde.

184
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.546
Kate Wilde. is that you?

185
00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:10.854
Come on up here.

186
00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:12.639
Ladies and gentlemen.

187
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:15.685
the winner of the
$100.000 dream wedding.

188
00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:16.991
You won!
Ha ha!

189
00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:19.471
She won!

190
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:22.170
No. no. there's been
some kind of mistake and--

191
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.258
No.

192
00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:24.520
No. no. do you know what?

193
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:25.434
We're just gonna have
a little chitchat.

194
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.435
We'll be right back.

195
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.132
Thank you very much.

196
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:32.615
Must be wedding nerves.

197
00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:34.399
She'll be right up here
in a moment. folks.

198
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.358
$100.000 dream wedding.

199
00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:38.534
Kate Wilde.
Isn't it wonderful?

200
00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:42.799
Megs. what are you doing?

201
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.931
I can't accept this!

202
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:46.281
Sure you can.

203
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:48.065
You won. fair and square.

204
00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:49.153
They picked you.

205
00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:51.025
I'm not getting married!

206
00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:52.156
So?

207
00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:53.549
Only you and I know that.

208
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.857
Look. do you see any
TV crews. paparazzi?

209
00:09:56.987 --> 00:10:00.600
Outside of this building.
nobody knows. and nobody cares.

210
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.993
Like not even these
businesses care who win.

211
00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:05.953
They're doing this just for
publicity and advertising.

212
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:06.867
Uh. excuse me?

213
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:07.911
Kate Wilde?

214
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:09.391
They're ready for you.

215
00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:11.219
Is everything okay?

216
00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:12.568
No. it's not.

217
00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:14.570
Yes. yes. everything is fine.

218
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:16.398
She's just a little shy.

219
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:18.400
Could you just give
us one more minute?

220
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.270
Okay. yeah.

221
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:20.315
Thanks.

222
00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:24.972
Katey. the next couple months.
what are you going to do?

223
00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:26.538
Well. work?

224
00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:27.757
No. no. I mean.
to meet people.

225
00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:31.543
Specifically. single
men type people.

226
00:10:31.674 --> 00:10:34.155
Office parties.
bars. Craigslist?

227
00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:37.941
Okay. fine. what about
just going out on the town.

228
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:40.901
getting pampered and
waxed and massaged.

229
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:44.382
new clothes. new look.
$100.000 new you?

230
00:10:44.513 --> 00:10:45.862
How does that sound?

231
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:48.735
But what about the other
women. the real brides?

232
00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:51.389
Who's to say. by June.
you won't be a real bride?

233
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.653
History. logic. reality.

234
00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:55.698
It could happen.

235
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:58.614
You're being pro-active.
make it happen.

236
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.747
Okay. fine. then do it for me.

237
00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:04.185
I'm not going to see you
for a really long time.

238
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:06.535
Katey. this is a gift from God!

239
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:10.365
We can do all of this
fantastic stuff together!

240
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:14.935
God. Katey. for once in your
life. don't be sensible.

241
00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:15.892
Live it up!

242
00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:18.503
You could meet more people

243
00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:21.985
and have more fun than
you've had in forever.

244
00:11:25.772 --> 00:11:27.034
Okay. but you're
forgetting something.

245
00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:28.339
What?

246
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.298
The wedding!

247
00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:33.693
50% of the bride and
groom thing. it's missing.

248
00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:37.609
Well. you just break up!

249
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.872
With who?

250
00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:42.223
Raoul.

251
00:11:42.353 --> 00:11:43.703
Raoul?

252
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:46.357
Raoul. Ted. Fred. it
doesn't really matter.

253
00:11:46.488 --> 00:11:49.578
You just say that your
guy gets cold feet.

254
00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:51.972
My darling Kate.

255
00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:54.626
It's not you. it's me.

256
00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:57.368
I'm just not quite ready
to commit but I hope--

257
00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:58.369
Okay. spare me.

258
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.981
I know the drill.

259
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:06.203
Okay. I am crazy
to even think this. but...

260
00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:10.425
Maybe. the day after you leave.

261
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:14.559
I could call them and tell
them that the wedding is off

262
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.388
and they'll have time
to find a real bride.

263
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.476
Yeah!

264
00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.217
Go. Katey. go. Katey!

265
00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:23.351
You are insane and I
am insane for listening.

266
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:25.570
Yeah. it runs in the family.

267
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:28.095
Look. Katey. you're doing this.

268
00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:31.925
If you don't. you're gonna
regret it for your entire life.

269
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:34.405
Oh. I already regret it.

270
00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:35.363
No more talk.

271
00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:36.581
C'mon. let's go.

272
00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:37.757
Let's go.

273
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:55.252
Kate Wilde has won a
$100.000 dream wedding.

274
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.601
And to get that. to come
up and get her prize.

275
00:12:56.732 --> 00:12:57.602
Come on up. Kate!

276
00:12:57.733 --> 00:12:58.908

277
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.257
Sorry. everyone.

278
00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:01.911
New bride nerves.

279
00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.521
Kate. are you here?

280
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:07.134
Oh. ladies and gentlemen.

281
00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:13.749

wedding just for you.

285
00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:22.018
Thank you.

286
00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.672
Sorry. she's a little shy.

287
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.763
I am Kate's sister and I will
be accepting on her behalf.

288
00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:29.286
so thank you.

289
00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.114
Very nice of you.

290
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:32.202
A bridesmaid?

291
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:35.292
Uh. yeah. yeah. I sure am.

292
00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:36.511
Look. we're in a
bit of a hurry. so-

293
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.034
Yes. I saw that. I saw that.

294
00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:39.644
I saw you rush off there.

295
00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:41.603
Now. Kate. it almost looked
like you did not want

296
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:45.172
to win this contest.
but that can't be right.

297
00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:47.696
So tell me. Kate.
is your wonderful fiance

298
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.351
here with you today?

299
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:52.309
No. no. you know men.

300
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:54.442
They'd rather have
dental surgery

301
00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:56.661
than be dragged
to this place.

302
00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:59.360
My own fiance
refused to come.

303
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.362
Oh. so you're getting
married as well?

304
00:14:01.492 --> 00:14:04.321
Yes. yes. I am.

305
00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:06.019
He proposed last week.

306
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.934
Oh. that's wonderful.
congratulations to you both.

307
00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:09.587
Now. Kate.
I'm sure you'd love

308
00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:11.111
to have your fiance
standing right next to you

309
00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:12.460
on this special day.

310
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.853
Why don't
we give him a call

311
00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:15.158
and explain
to him all the

312
00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:16.029
wonderful things
that have happened to you?

313
00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:16.986
- No!
- No!

314
00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:18.031
No?

315
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:19.206
- No.
- No.

316
00:14:19.336 --> 00:14:20.468
No. we can't.

317
00:14:20.598 --> 00:14:24.820
He is in Mexico.

318
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.692
- Way up in the mountains...
- Oh. the mountains. yeah.

319
00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:29.912
by the ocean.

320
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:32.393
Yes. and there's no
cell phones there.

321
00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:33.742
There's not even Internet.

322
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.962
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor. a doctor.

323
00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:38.399
And he also builds
homes for the poor.

324
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:39.574
Awww!

325
00:14:39.704 --> 00:14:41.793
Anyway. we really
have to go. so...

326
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:45.275
Builds homes for
the poor in Mexico.

327
00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:47.147
Ladies and gentlemen.
I ask...

328
00:14:49.453 --> 00:14:50.802
You must be so proud of him.

329
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.588
She is. she really.
really is.

330
00:14:53.718 --> 00:14:56.112
She just can't stop talking
about him. except for right now.

331
00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:57.940
So. we could
just gotta grab--

332
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.682
What's his name?

333
00:15:00.812 --> 00:15:01.683
Raoul.

334
00:15:01.813 --> 00:15:04.077
Raoul?

335
00:15:04.207 --> 00:15:05.078

336
00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:06.383

Sounds lovely.

340
00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:18.265
Anyway. we're actually
on our way to the airport.

341
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:19.875
we've gotta go get him.

342
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.442

Oh. please allow us to
take you to the airport.

355
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:45.379

- Please.

356
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:47.424
We have a stretch
limousine at your disposal.

357
00:15:47.555 --> 00:15:48.512
A what?

358
00:15:48.643 --> 00:15:50.036
A stretched limo.

359
00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:53.126
A limo.

360
00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:54.170
A limo.

361
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:56.216
- Yes.
- Uh...

362
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:58.305
Actually. we can just take
a couple more pictures.

363
00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.349
Couple more pictures.

364
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.350
Andy. if you would.

365
00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:01.351
All right.

366
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:02.526
Yeah. not a problem.

367
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:04.006
You know the drill.
right in the lens.

368
00:16:04.137 --> 00:16:06.139
and the smile thing again.

369
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.057
Uh. yeah. say "I love weddings!"

370
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:12.188
I love weddings!

371
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.450
I love weddings.

372
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.541
Stretch limo. baby!

373
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:19.500
Every Sunday
until the Big Day.

374
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.242
You mean. our court
date. when we get sued?

375
00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:24.505
What do you
mean we. stranger?

376
00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:26.855
I've been carjacked.
taken hostage.

377
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.249
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

378
00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:31.816
Oh yes. a limo. champagne.

379
00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:33.122
You poor thing.

380
00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:36.343
I swear I am an only child.

381
00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:37.909
You must have been adopted

382
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.434
by some depressed Swedish
Puritans or something.

383
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:42.871
Mom. Dad. my friends.

384
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.743
Oh. Kate. nobody knows
except for you and I.

385
00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:47.963
And even if someone does find
out. what's the big deal?

386
00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:49.921
You won a big prize
at the Wedding Fair.

387
00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.532
Yeah. a wedding.

388
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:54.317
Usually. that
involves two people.

389
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:04.545
Oh. let's have
lunch at La Gavroche.

390
00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:07.722
French food. Kate. we're
going to eat French food!

391
00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:12.031
Oh. I am so having this.

392
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:13.945
What is it?

393
00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:17.384
I have no idea. but it's
100 bucks. so must be good.

394
00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:18.559
Oh. you and Dave go.

395
00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:19.647
We can't.

396
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:21.127
You have to be there.

397
00:17:21.257 --> 00:17:22.954
You're the bride. remember?

398
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.043
Oh.

399
00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:32.355
We're here.

400
00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:34.401
Uh. where?

401
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:35.576
The airport?

402
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:40.059
Right.

403
00:17:47.283 --> 00:17:49.938
Thank you.

404
00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:54.160
First time in a limo. and
nobody we know sees us.

405
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.422
Thank God.

406
00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.553
Need help with anything?

407
00:17:56.684 --> 00:17:58.816
Yeah. actually you
can just take us back.

408
00:17:58.947 --> 00:17:59.730
Take you back? But--

409
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:01.428
Sorry.

410
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:03.038
No. no. thank you so
much for the ride.

411
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:04.083
We're okay.

412
00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:05.040
Yes. thank you.

413
00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:06.955
It was lovely.

414
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.957
We'll see you
next Sunday. right?

415
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.872
Hey. what are you
doing in June?

416
00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:12.352
Sorry.

417
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:15.311
She was dropped on
her head as a baby.

418
00:18:15.442 --> 00:18:17.357
You know. maybe stuck a fork
in a toaster at one point.

419
00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:18.619
Anyway. thank you so much.

420
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:20.490
Limo is beautiful.

421
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:23.493
You take care now.
we gotta catch our flight.

422
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:25.365
Our bags are in there with
our fiance. that's fine.

423
00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:26.409
Thank you.

424
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.758
Take care now.

425
00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:36.463
Okay. we have had our fun.

426
00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:41.294
Uh. no. we are
just getting started.

427
00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:42.338
No. we are not.

428
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:44.079
We are going home.

429
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.168
Wait. weren't you supposed
to meet Dave after the fair?

430
00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:48.475
Oh my gosh. with everything
going on. I totally forgot.

431
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:56.787
Hello.

432
00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:59.486
<i>Hi. uh.
we're at the airport.</i>

433
00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:00.530
You're where?

434
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.576
<i>At the airport.</i>

435
00:19:02.706 --> 00:19:04.230
We don't have our car.

436
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.622
It's kind of a long story.

437
00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:07.537
<i>Megan. I'm
at the consulate.</i>

438
00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:09.409
<i>You need to
be here with me.</i>

439
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:10.758
Crikeys. we got like
a million things to do

440
00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:13.108
and you go to the
bloody airport?

441
00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.110
<i>Where's your car?</i>

442
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:16.155
At the fair.

443
00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:19.114
We drove here
in a stretched limo.

444
00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:20.376
It was fantastic!

445
00:19:20.507 --> 00:19:21.943
I don't give
a rat's back...

446
00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:25.033
I don't give a rat's back side
if flying dingos took you!

447
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.427
<i>Megan. you've got to
be more responsible.</i>

448
00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:30.081
Just. just get here
as fast as you can.

449
00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:32.040
Okay. bye. I love you.

450
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:38.264
We need two taxis.

451
00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:39.656
I've gotta go
to the consulate.

452
00:19:39.787 --> 00:19:40.962
Passport stuff.

453
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:42.006
You okay?

454
00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:45.445
Just stressed.

455
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.360
The wedding. the trip.

456
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.058
We've fought more
in the past six days

457
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.843
than we have in the
entire six months.

458
00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:55.150
God. 60 million men
in this country.

459
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:56.499
and I marry
an Australian?

460
00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:01.156
But I'm glad
we won this thing.

461
00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:03.071
It was fun today. huh?

462
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.682
Raoul DeFirenza?

463
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:07.206
DeCredenza.

464
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:09.295
Raoul DeCredenza.

465
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:10.339
Six four. blue eyes.

466
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.385
Yeah. buns of steel. I know.

467
00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:14.387
You are a nut.

468
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:15.518
Why couldn't you have
gone with John Smith?

469
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.520
That name. they
can't check up on.

470
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.261
Who. the wedding cops?

471
00:20:19.392 --> 00:20:20.915
Nobody cares. Kate.

472
00:20:21.045 --> 00:20:25.180
In two weeks. you and Dave will
be split up. and it's over.

473
00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:26.442
What?
It was a good idea.

474
00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:29.924
Uh. no. Meg. you said
Dave. not Raoul.

475
00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:32.318
Oh. nobody cares what
you call your fake husband.

476
00:20:32.448 --> 00:20:33.667
The next two weeks. sis.

477
00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:36.800
you and me are going to
bump it like a trumpet.

478
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:38.019
Am I right?

479
00:20:39.803 --> 00:20:42.153
Relax.

480
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:43.894
Nobody knows but us. okay?

481
00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:45.766
And I'm not gonna tell a soul.

482
00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:47.115
Unless we get caught.

483
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.029
Then I talk.

484
00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:49.639
Oh.

485
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.250
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

486
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.557
Look. I'll call you
when I'm done. okay?

487
00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:57.734
And tomorrow. first thing.
we're going to the spa.

488
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:08.658
<i>Maybe the
day after you leave.</i>

489
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:12.706
<i>I could call them and tell
them that the wedding is off</i>

490
00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:15.883
<i>and they'll have time
to find a real bride.</i>

491
00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:16.927
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
00:22:30.566 --> 00:22:32.742
That's perfect. thank you.

493
00:22:49.846 --> 00:22:51.152
Feeling better?

494
00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:52.980
Less paranoid?

495
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.417
Kinda. yeah.

496
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:57.245
Good.

497
00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:00.596
I was worried you'd enter into
a Witness Relocation Program.

498
00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:08.038
- Again...
- Oh. oh.

499
00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:10.519
Congratulations.

500
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.653
It is a shame that your
fiance couldn't join us.

501
00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:15.916
So. will you guys
be ready to order?

502
00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:19.136
Megan. you go.

503
00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:20.442
Hello?

504
00:23:20.573 --> 00:23:22.270
Is this Kate Wilde?

505
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:23.880
Yep. speaking.

506
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.491
Hi. Kate. it's Bob Hines.

507
00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:27.449
editor of Calgary
Modern Wedding Magazine.

508
00:23:29.103 --> 00:23:32.019
You must remember me.
we met yesterday.

509
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.108
Uh. uh. uh.
yes. yes.

510
00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:36.589
Have you used
any of your prizes yet?

511
00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:38.112
Don't touch the wine!

512
00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:39.287
Why. what's wrong?

513
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.985
It's the wedding fair.
they found out.

514
00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:44.292
Mr. Hines. I'll pay it
all back. every penny.

515
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.076
even for the wine.

516
00:23:46.207 --> 00:23:47.513
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:47.643 --> 00:23:49.819
You know. I'd been drinking.
I wasn't thinking.

518
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.386
Please forgive me.

519
00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:52.953
I'll deal with this later.

520
00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:53.997
Mr. Hines?

521
00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:55.608
Hello. Kate. Kate?

522
00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:58.393
I'm sorry. it's just
a madhouse here today.

523
00:23:58.524 --> 00:24:00.917
Now. Kate. we're gonna need
photographs of you and Raoul.

524
00:24:01.048 --> 00:24:02.658
It's for our June issue.

525
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:04.573
Andy Swenson is going
to be the photographer.

526
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:06.096
he'll take the shots.

527
00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:07.054
And I certainly hope
you're enjoying your gifts.

528
00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:08.272
We're fine. they don't know.

529
00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:10.318
No. I have to tell him.

530
00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:11.450
Mr. Hines--

531
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.016
- Give me that.
- Hey!

532
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.107
Hi. this is Megan.
Kate's sister.

533
00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:18.718
Do you always speak for Kate?

534
00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:20.284
Yes. I do.

535
00:24:20.415 --> 00:24:21.764
We'll get you those pictures.

536
00:24:21.895 --> 00:24:23.287
But we gotta go. bye!

537
00:24:23.418 --> 00:24:24.332
Okay.

538
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:27.204
Charming lady.

539
00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:28.249
What are you doing?

540
00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:29.293
Give me that!

541
00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:30.904
No. Kate. we're fine.

542
00:24:31.034 --> 00:24:32.340
- They don't know.
- They will soon.

543
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:33.341
Give me that!

544
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.647
No. Kate. look.

545
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:36.866
They just want pictures
of you and some guy.

546
00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:38.651
What's the big deal. you guys
are gonna be broken up anyway

547
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.261
by the time the
magazine comes out.

548
00:24:40.391 --> 00:24:41.610
They'll just pull the photo.

549
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:43.090
What photo?

550
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.092
And what guy?

551
00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:50.445
Any photo. you and any guy.

552
00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:51.664
Dave!

553
00:24:51.794 --> 00:24:54.710
Dave will do it.

554
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:57.713
He's tall. he's good-looking.
he's got a great butt.

555
00:24:57.844 --> 00:24:59.628
Megs. what do
we tell him. huh?

556
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:01.195
How do we explain to him

557
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:04.503
that he's posing for
wedding photos with me?

558
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:07.810
Megan?

559
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:09.595
Oh my gosh.
he already knows.

560
00:25:09.725 --> 00:25:11.422
You already told him.

561
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:13.468
Katey. I'm sorry.
I had to tell him.

562
00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:14.991
He was so mad
at me yesterday.

563
00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:17.559
Look. you should see
our passport pictures.

564
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.693
we were both so upset.
we look horrible.

565
00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:26.220
You know. these
past couple days.

566
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.570
I don't know if I'm
doing the right thing.

567
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.834
Megan. he loves
you and you love him.

568
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:33.357
I know. I know.

569
00:25:35.795 --> 00:25:37.971
It's just with him
proposing and me leaving.

570
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:40.234
it's just all
happening so fast.

571
00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:42.715
And God. in two
weeks I'm going to be

572
00:25:42.845 --> 00:25:45.587
in a whole different
country with a husband!

573
00:25:45.718 --> 00:25:49.722
And without Mom. without Dad.
without my big sister.

574
00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:53.552
I'm such a baby.
I can't stand it.

575
00:25:53.682 --> 00:25:55.118
No. no. no.

576
00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:56.990
You're actually very brave.

577
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.993
I'm the one who's
backed out twice.

578
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:01.298
Heck. look at me now.

579
00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:02.517
I can't even go through
with a fake wedding.

580
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:09.524
Did you tell anyone else?

581
00:26:09.655 --> 00:26:10.569
Hmmm?

582
00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:12.571
Megs.

583
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.224
What. is it all
over your Facebook?

584
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:16.009
No. no!

585
00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:19.665
Just one little
e-mail. to Vicky.

586
00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:22.755
but I swore to her.
complete and total secrecy.

587
00:26:22.885 --> 00:26:25.671
I can hear 100 Twitters
spreading the news.

588
00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:27.760
No. Kate. that's
so not happening.

589
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.719
Look. Dave and I will
come to your work tomorrow

590
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.025
and we'll take some
pictures of you guys.

591
00:26:32.155 --> 00:26:33.504
Nuh uh.

592
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.810
They want the photographer
from the wedding fair.

593
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:36.072
you know. the guy
with the beard?

594
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:39.423
All right. sure. we'll do it.

595
00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:42.426
You and Dave should
totally have a fight!

596
00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:43.819
You know. like a
little argument.

597
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.994
That way. it sort
of sets the seeds

598
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:46.430
for the eventual breakup.

599
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.128
Huh?
What do you think?

600
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:52.175
I think we're both gonna be
wearing straight-jackets soon.

601
00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:55.701
Oh. Kate. it's just
13 more days. and then...

602
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.920
I'm sorry. I caught
Frozen Female Feet.

603
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.313
Wedding's off. bye!

604
00:27:00.749 --> 00:27:01.794
Give me that.

605
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:05.493
Where's our waiter?

606
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:06.494
I'm hungry.

607
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.377
Hey. guys.

608
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:21.857
G'day. darling wife.

609
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:23.076
Oh yeah.

610
00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:24.686
Look. thanks for doing this.

611
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:27.167
I know it seems crazy but
Megan talked me into it.

612
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:28.603
Me too.

613
00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:31.258
I was going to refuse
but then it dawned on me.

614
00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.782
things just might work out.

615
00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:37.568
Oi. crikey. not even
bloody well married yet.

616
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:38.526
All right.
we should get going.

617
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:39.570
I only have an hour.

618
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:41.572
Katherine. sorry. excuse me.

619
00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:43.662
Before you go. these
rental contracts.

620
00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:44.750
What about them?

621
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.925
Well. you see.
there's an important

622
00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:48.144
disclosure
failure here.

623
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:49.406
Your wedding!

624
00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:51.365
Surprise!

625
00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:53.846
What are you talking about?

626
00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:54.934
Oh my God!

627
00:27:55.064 --> 00:27:56.979
And you must be the lucky man?

628
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.633
Am I?

629
00:27:58.764 --> 00:28:00.591
Speech.
speech. speech. speech. speech.

630
00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:03.203
speech. speech. speech.
speech. speech. speech!

631
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.640
Uh. listen. guys.
this is very nice of you.

632
00:28:05.771 --> 00:28:07.294
but you didn't have
to do this because I-

633
00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:08.730
Oh. we know.

634
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:10.166
I mean. what could
we possibly get you?

635
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:11.472
You already have
everything you need.

636
00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:13.126
Actually. I don't.

637
00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:15.258
That's the problem.

638
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:16.564
Wow. this is embarrassing.

639
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.566
Bottom line. I'm
not getting married.

640
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.350
You know. I'd been drinking.
I wasn't thinking.

641
00:28:20.481 --> 00:28:23.571
and I made a very big mistake.

642
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:26.487
Guys. guys. come on.
you'll work through this.

643
00:28:26.617 --> 00:28:28.184
Megan.

644
00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:29.925
They're just going through
a little bit of a rough patch.

645
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:32.014
Megan. I will push your
head through a rough patch.

646
00:28:32.145 --> 00:28:33.842
if you don't shut up.

647
00:28:33.973 --> 00:28:35.539
It happens to all
couples before weddings.

648
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.674
You know. the stress.
the travel. passports.

649
00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:42.982
But I'm sure these
two will work it out.

650
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:46.637
We just have to talk.
we'll be right back.

651
00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:48.030
I'm sure it'll work out.

652
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:49.902
I mean. trust me.
I'm a bit of an expert.

653
00:28:50.032 --> 00:28:52.556
Been married three times.

654
00:28:52.687 --> 00:28:54.123
You do have a
pre-nup though. right?

655
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.264
You are embarrassing me
in front of my co-workers.

656
00:29:04.394 --> 00:29:06.048
Megan. this is over.
done. finished.

657
00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:07.136
See this?

658
00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:08.572
Take a good look!

659
00:29:08.703 --> 00:29:10.226
I am in the paper.
for goodness sake!

660
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:11.575
What. some neighborhood rag

661
00:29:11.706 --> 00:29:13.186
that maybe 10 people
will ever see?

662
00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:14.665
They saw it!

663
00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:16.406
Anyway. I told them that
I'm not getting married.

664
00:29:16.537 --> 00:29:18.626
so this is it. it's over.

665
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.410
No. Kate. it's not over.

666
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:21.934
Not until we tell
the wedding people.

667
00:29:22.064 --> 00:29:23.892
And we'll do that
after we have our fun.

668
00:29:24.023 --> 00:29:26.721
Look. Kate. you agreed
to do this. come on!

669
00:29:26.852 --> 00:29:29.158
That was before my
co-workers found out

670
00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:31.117
that I'm marrying
my sister's fiance.

671
00:29:31.247 --> 00:29:32.422
They don't know who Dave is.

672
00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:34.337
They will in two weeks.

673
00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:36.426
when they see you two in the
paper cutting wedding cake.

674
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:42.041
So they'll just think he
moves fast and that I'm a tramp.

675
00:29:42.171 --> 00:29:43.477
Look. I'm leaving
anyway. remember?

676
00:29:43.607 --> 00:29:44.608
I'm not!

677
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:46.741
I have to deal with this.

678
00:29:46.872 --> 00:29:49.309
Look. Megan. I love
you. but you are 26.

679
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:52.399
It is time for you to grow up.

680
00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:54.618
You mean. be like you.

681
00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:57.186
What's that supposed to mean?

682
00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:02.104
What. you don't
want to be boring.

683
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:04.280
sensible. and afraid
of commitment?

684
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:06.630
Geez. what's so bad about that?

685
00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:09.851
The only thing worse would be

686
00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:11.853
an irresponsible. immature girl

687
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:14.334
who'd marry a man she's
only known for six months.

688
00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:15.422
Sounds great.

689
00:30:15.552 --> 00:30:16.597
Sign me up.

690
00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:17.685
I did!

691
00:30:20.427 --> 00:30:21.645
This is ridiculous.

692
00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:23.822
I can't believe
we're arguing about it.

693
00:30:23.952 --> 00:30:25.258
I know!

694
00:30:25.388 --> 00:30:28.000
Look. if you want
to call it quits.

695
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.438
and break poor
Dave's heart. do it.

696
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:33.527
At least we had one fun day.

697
00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:38.749
Well.
I did tell the truth

698
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.056
about me not
getting married.

699
00:30:41.187 --> 00:30:44.407
So if you're going to guilt
trip me into having fun.

700
00:30:44.538 --> 00:30:46.322
we better go get my
future ex-husband.

701
00:30:46.453 --> 00:30:48.629
Um. yeah. before
he dumps us both.

702
00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:56.811
I'm sorry. but if you
don't have an appointment

703
00:30:56.942 --> 00:30:59.031
with Mr. Hines. you
can't see him today.

704
00:31:01.642 --> 00:31:03.035
He'll want to see me.

705
00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:06.560
Mr. Hines!

706
00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:14.089
This is gonna be great.

707
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.700
I have thought
this all through.

708
00:31:16.831 --> 00:31:17.876
Dave. you're really
going to pretend

709
00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:20.008
to be Raoul DeCrendeza?

710
00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:21.444
Si. senorita.

711
00:31:21.575 --> 00:31:23.490
No problemo. love.

712
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.708
Oh.

713
00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:26.362
What?

714
00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:27.581
A subtle hint of
Aussie poking through?

715
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:30.932
Just a wee bit there. mate.

716
00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:33.282
Actually. Dave and I
have come up with a plan.

717
00:31:33.413 --> 00:31:34.327
Right. honey bunny?

718
00:31:34.457 --> 00:31:35.458
Right. pookie-bear.

719
00:31:35.589 --> 00:31:36.503
What is that plan?

720
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:37.634
A good one.

721
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:39.549
Just let me do the talking.

722
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.334
That's how I got into this
mess in the first place.

723
00:31:41.464 --> 00:31:43.379
so please tell me the plan.

724
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.467
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

725
00:31:44.598 --> 00:31:45.816
Look. when we go in there.

726
00:31:45.947 --> 00:31:48.994
Dave. I mean. Raoul

727
00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:53.302
speaks no English.

728
00:31:53.433 --> 00:31:54.303
Ah.

729
00:31:55.609 --> 00:31:57.480
Right. and then how
do we talk to him?

730
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:02.181
Oh.

731
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:03.356
Should've made him a mute.

732
00:32:03.486 --> 00:32:05.314
then we could've
used sign language.

733
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:06.402
It's true.

734
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:07.751
That's a right bright idea.

735
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.931
What?
It is.

736
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.976
So what do we do now?

737
00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:18.414
Come on. love.
it doesn't matter.

738
00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:21.243
This photographer
bloke won't care.

739
00:32:23.202 --> 00:32:24.507
No English it is.

740
00:32:26.031 --> 00:32:26.945
Let's go.

741
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:36.345
Hello?

742
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:38.608
Andy?

743
00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:42.308
Guys. it's gonna be great.

744
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.050
Anybody here?

745
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.007
Hello?

746
00:32:47.617 --> 00:32:49.793
Yeah. be right there.

747
00:32:53.188 --> 00:32:54.407
Hi.

748
00:32:54.537 --> 00:32:55.886
Hi. I'm Megan.

749
00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:57.410
- I remember.
- Hi. Megan.

750
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.412
And hi. Kate.

751
00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:00.413
Good to see you again.

752
00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:01.762
You must be Raoul?

753
00:33:01.892 --> 00:33:03.633
Tell me. how does it
feel to be the winner

754
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.592
of a $100.000 wedding?

755
00:33:05.722 --> 00:33:07.550
Raoul does not
speak any English.

756
00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:09.030
Oh.

757
00:33:10.727 --> 00:33:12.294
Or Spanish.

758
00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:13.817
Really?

759
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:16.124
That must prove difficult
working in Mexico.

760
00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:17.430
Saving children.

761
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.822
Um. yeah.

762
00:33:18.953 --> 00:33:21.869
Look. we're in a
bit of a rush. so...

763
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.263
Oh. yes.
the pictures. right?

764
00:33:24.393 --> 00:33:25.960
Yeah well. hey. I saw
you guys walking in.

765
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:28.571
took the liberty of just
grabbing a few candids.

766
00:33:28.702 --> 00:33:31.879
Got one here that's-
I think really special.

767
00:33:37.754 --> 00:33:41.236
This is gonna be one
interesting wedding album.

768
00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:46.111
Yes. you see.
in Raoul's country.

769
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:49.288
men kiss the
bride's sisters.

770
00:33:49.418 --> 00:33:50.854
Megan. give it a rest. okay?

771
00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:52.160
We're busted.

772
00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:53.248
Yeah. I reckon so.

773
00:33:53.379 --> 00:33:54.293
Sorry. mate.

774
00:33:54.423 --> 00:33:55.555
Feel like a bloody fool now.

775
00:33:55.685 --> 00:33:57.252
Oh. I mean. he speaks
kind of English.

776
00:33:57.383 --> 00:33:58.732
Hi. Andy.

777
00:33:58.862 --> 00:33:59.994
- Where you from?
- Australia.

778
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.300
Dave Whyte.

779
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.389
Megan and I are
getting married.

780
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.391
And I am not.

781
00:34:05.521 --> 00:34:07.306
But I think I told you
that at the fair. didn't I?

782
00:34:07.436 --> 00:34:08.742
Yes.

783
00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:11.310
You must think we're
idiots. or crazy.

784
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.528
Or both.

785
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:13.660
Actually.
I'm just more curious

786
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.401
as to why you even
entered the contest.

787
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.663
Oh. I didn't.

788
00:34:16.793 --> 00:34:18.752
No.

789
00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:20.841
Look. I never thought
that she would win.

790
00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:24.888
And when she did. I thought.
meh. we'll just have some fun.

791
00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:26.760
and maybe she'll
meet a nice guy.

792
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.414
I was only going to
do it for two weeks.

793
00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:29.937
That's how long Megan
and Dave are in town for.

794
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.548
and then I was gonna
have a break up.

795
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.810
And then they'd
pick somebody else.

796
00:34:33.941 --> 00:34:35.682
Look. we didn't
mean any harm by it.

797
00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:37.249
we were just having fun.

798
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:40.121
So please. don't
turn her in now.

799
00:34:40.252 --> 00:34:43.255
Oh. like to the
marriage police?

800
00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.953
Drop the ring. come
out with your hands up!

801
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.347
So you're not mad?

802
00:34:48.477 --> 00:34:50.653
No. not at all.
this is hilarious.

803
00:34:50.784 --> 00:34:51.915
You guys are great.

804
00:34:52.046 --> 00:34:52.829
I mean. I've got a
warped sense of humor.

805
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.614
so as far
as I'm concerned.

806
00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:56.659
you can just milk this like
as long as you need to.

807
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.096
- Really?
- Yeah.

808
00:34:59.227 --> 00:35:00.359
Well. in that case...

809
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:01.447
No!

810
00:35:01.577 --> 00:35:02.926
No. two weeks.

811
00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:04.145
This has been stressful enough.

812
00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:05.712
I feel like I'm actually
getting married.

813
00:35:05.842 --> 00:35:08.149
Got that right.

814
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.934
No offense. mate. but what's
with all the bloody fooferall?

815
00:35:11.065 --> 00:35:12.980
Matching bloody
teacups and napkins.

816
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.286
Christ.

817
00:35:15.678 --> 00:35:17.202
Me and Megs are having
a simple quickie wedding.

818
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:18.986
and it's still a nightmare.

819
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.640
Uh. thanks a lot.

820
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:21.902
You know what I mean.

821
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:23.860
What should be so simple
usually just turns

822
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:25.645
into a cocked-up
footy scrum-bash.

823
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.081
A what?

824
00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.952
I dunno. but I'm
going to buy a book.

825
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.432
I think what he's
trying to say is.

826
00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:31.912
correct me if I'm wrong.

827
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:34.132
you want like a more simple
wedding. like Vegas style?

828
00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:36.438
Just 50 bucks. five
minutes. you're out or?

829
00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:37.526
50 bucks.

830
00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:39.267
Hey. look.

831
00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:42.966
A wedding is every woman's
once in a lifetime special day.

832
00:35:43.097 --> 00:35:46.318
There should be roses. there
should be candles. and doves.

833
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.276
and it should be romantic.

834
00:35:48.407 --> 00:35:49.886
Right. Kate?

835
00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:53.194
Well. seeing as I'm having
a $100.000 wedding. I agree.

836
00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:54.761
Katey. if you find
the right guy now.

837
00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:56.502
you'll be quite the catch.

838
00:35:56.632 --> 00:35:58.547
Except he'll have to
marry me in a few months.

839
00:35:58.678 --> 00:36:02.160
And we all know how well
quickie marriages turn out.

840
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.422
We're wasting your time.

841
00:36:03.552 --> 00:36:04.553
Very sorry
to bother you.

842
00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:06.294
but it's very nice
to have met you.

843
00:36:06.425 --> 00:36:07.295
It was nice to
have met you as well

844
00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:09.471
and you're not
bothering me at all.

845
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:13.562
In fact. Kate. I mean. are
you into tall. handsome men?

846
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:16.870
She is. mate.
but I'm taken.

847
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.872
Okay. well. I work
with models all the time

848
00:36:19.002 --> 00:36:20.656
so I was thinking. what
if I just spoke to a few

849
00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:22.528
and told them that
they would be part

850
00:36:22.658 --> 00:36:25.139
of this dream wedding
campaign. right?

851
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.273
And you just need to pretend
to be a groom for two weeks.

852
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:30.275
I mean. a lot of them would
probably come out for free

853
00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:33.060
just to get their
faces out there.

854
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.366
Uh. yeah.

855
00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:35.584
I don't know.

856
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:44.419
It's not a bad way
to meet somebody.

857
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.638
Oh my God.
it's a great idea!

858
00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:48.249
Look Katey.
look at these hunks!

859
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.511
They're gorgeous.

860
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:54.212
Just like you. honey.

861
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.215
All right.
let's pick a hottie.

862
00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:59.347
Oh. come on. Megs. I mean.
I can't just look at-

863
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:01.262
Wow. he's fit.

864
00:37:01.393 --> 00:37:02.307
Uh. yeah.

865
00:37:02.437 --> 00:37:03.917
- Uh. Glenn.
- Glenn?

866
00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:05.266
Yeah. Glenn.

867
00:37:05.397 --> 00:37:07.616
Yeah. he's a fitness
and sport model. but...

868
00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:12.055
- No?
- No.

869
00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:13.100
Trust me.

870
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.756
Oh. what about him?

871
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.628
Or him?

872
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:23.589
Or him. or him.
or him. or him?

873
00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:25.808
Babe. babe.

874
00:37:25.939 --> 00:37:28.376
I think she can
only choose one.

875
00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:31.249
This coming from the
guy marrying two sisters.

876
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:34.077
Okay. guys. I don't
know about this.

877
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:37.037
I mean. yes. they are
very good-looking.

878
00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:39.692
but I'm attracted to someone
with a good sense of humor.

879
00:37:39.822 --> 00:37:41.911
and someone I can
actually talk to.

880
00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:43.130
God. Katey. what's
wrong with you?

881
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.305
You drive me crazy.

882
00:37:44.436 --> 00:37:45.524
You know. Kate.
I wouldn't judge

883
00:37:45.654 --> 00:37:47.134
a handsome book by
its cover too quickly.

884
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:50.311
I mean. a lot of these guys
are students. pre-med. pre-law.

885
00:37:50.442 --> 00:37:51.269
they're actually
pretty bright.

886
00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:52.574
And they're hot!

887
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:55.273
Look. Katey. you so
totally have to do this.

888
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:56.274
Please?

889
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:00.626
I guess. maybe.

890
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:02.889
Yay. we can double-date!

891
00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:04.630
So. Biff. how much
weight did you lift today?

892
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.718
A small country?

893
00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:06.806
Belgium?

894
00:38:09.243 --> 00:38:11.027
Either way. we still
have to be kind of careful.

895
00:38:11.158 --> 00:38:13.378
Some of them are married.
some of them have girlfriends.

896
00:38:13.508 --> 00:38:16.337
and then some of them are
married with girlfriends.

897
00:38:18.383 --> 00:38:21.429
Yeah. I don't know
how that works.

898
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.735
Hello?

899
00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:23.736
Kate Wilde?

900
00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:24.911
Bob Hines. hi.

901
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:26.782
<i>Listen. Kate.
I was just wondering.</i>

902
00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:28.697
<i>have you and
Raoul had a chance</i>

903
00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:30.830
to get to the studio and get
those pictures taken yet?

904
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.049
Uh. no.

905
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.486
No. we haven't just yet.

906
00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:37.053
Would you mind holding
on just a second?

907
00:38:37.184 --> 00:38:38.490
It's the magazine guy.

908
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.492
he wants to know if we
took the pictures yet.

909
00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:41.710
I really don't like this.

910
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:42.624
Bob Hines?

911
00:38:42.755 --> 00:38:43.799
Yeah.

912
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.714
You mind if I take it?

913
00:38:49.675 --> 00:38:51.416
Bob. hey.
it's Andy Swenson here.

914
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.591
Listen. could you call back?

915
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:55.158
I am literally just
about to shoot Kate

916
00:38:55.289 --> 00:38:57.030
and her fiance right now.

917
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.988
Yeah. with a camera. yeah.

918
00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:00.729
No. yeah. they're
a wonderful couple.

919
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.165
Yeah.

920
00:39:02.296 --> 00:39:03.776
No. not a problem.

921
00:39:03.906 --> 00:39:05.038
Yeah. absolutely.
I'll e-mail you

922
00:39:05.168 --> 00:39:06.474
as soon as
I have the images.

923
00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:08.258
Yeah. okay.

924
00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:09.216
Bye.

925
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.177
Well. I mean. it's possible
that he suspects something?

926
00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:16.615
Either way. we should probably
pick you a groom real quick.

927
00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:18.051
No. no. no. if he
suspects something.

928
00:39:18.181 --> 00:39:19.792
I really don't want to
get you into trouble.

929
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:21.228
No skin off my back.

930
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.230
I mean. as far as I'm
concerned. you came in.

931
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.493
I shot you and your fiance.
and he happens to be a model.

932
00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:27.277
Yeah. what's the big deal?

933
00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:29.367
You're gonna break up with
this guy in two weeks anyway.

934
00:39:29.497 --> 00:39:32.544
Unless my
mail-order-husband plan works.

935
00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:35.590
Pick a dude.

936
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:38.506
I'm sorry. Joanne. but our
photographer Andy Swenson says

937
00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:40.378
that Kate and Raoul
are at the studio

938
00:39:40.508 --> 00:39:42.423
getting their pictures
taken as we speak.

939
00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:44.773
And I'm telling you
that that is a crock!

940
00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:47.428
This chick ain't
getting married. okay?

941
00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:48.777
Just listen again.

942
00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:51.084
Oh. please.

943
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.043
The day after
you leave. I can call them

944
00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:56.872
and tell them that
the wedding is off

945
00:39:57.003 --> 00:40:00.223
and they'll have time
to find a real bride.

946
00:40:00.354 --> 00:40:01.442
Let's go out for pride.

947
00:40:01.573 --> 00:40:02.748
What. no!

948
00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:04.271
No. that is not
what she is saying.

949
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.447
I'm sorry. Joanne. I don't
know what they're saying.

950
00:40:06.578 --> 00:40:08.493
I don't know who
these people are.

951
00:40:08.623 --> 00:40:10.669
All I see are feet.

952
00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:13.498
And quite frankly. dear. I
don't know who you are. okay?

953
00:40:13.628 --> 00:40:15.543
So. I don't
want to be rude.

954
00:40:15.674 --> 00:40:17.980
but I think
it's time you left. okay?

955
00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:20.243
If I can prove it.
will you give me the prize?

956
00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:21.723
- What?
- Mr. Hines--

957
00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:23.551
Do we have a deal?

958
00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:25.031
Sure. yeah.

959
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:27.120
- Yes. yes?
- You will. you bet.

960
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.426
- Yes. yes.
- Sure.

961
00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:30.471
Yes. Andy Swenson. yes!

962
00:40:32.038 --> 00:40:33.126
Out of my way!

963
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:36.085
You have a
call on line two

964
00:40:36.216 --> 00:40:37.391
and I need you to
make a decision

965
00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:39.045
on these fabrics
really quick.

966
00:40:39.175 --> 00:40:42.831
Uh. Kari. get that to
the printers. please.

967
00:40:45.573 --> 00:40:47.445
As much fun as this is.

968
00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:49.272
Megan and I still have
some visa work to sort out.

969
00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:52.362
So. if you'll excuse us...

970
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:56.279
Um. I'll take this for you.
Katey. I'll help you out.

971
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.587
I'm sure she can handle it.

972
00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:02.111
Really. it'd be no problem.

973
00:41:02.242 --> 00:41:03.417
Nice to meet you. Andy.

974
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:04.940
You're a good sport.

975
00:41:05.071 --> 00:41:06.159
Kate. see you later.

976
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.337
Megan. I'm gonna
need that back.

977
00:41:15.951 --> 00:41:17.257
Thank you.

978
00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:22.523
Need the other one too.

979
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:30.183
Thank you.

980
00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:31.184
Have fun.

981
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:35.318
- You want lunch?
- Yeah.

982
00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:36.668
You like
soup and sandwich?

983
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:38.321
I mean. it's not
fancy. but it's free.

984
00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:39.453
Sure.

985
00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:40.498
Follow me.

986
00:41:42.804 --> 00:41:44.284
Aw. that was nice of
him to do that for Kate.

987
00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:47.374
What?

988
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:48.984
Oh. come on. love.

989
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:50.377
you think if your sister looked
like a wallaby's backside.

990
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:51.987
he'd be doing this?

991
00:41:52.118 --> 00:41:54.424
That bloke fancies her. wants
to give her the hard words.

992
00:41:54.555 --> 00:41:55.469
The what?

993
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.079
The hard words.

994
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:58.080
I don't know what they bloody
well call it in this country.

995
00:41:58.211 --> 00:41:59.473
but down under.
you put the hard words

996
00:41:59.604 --> 00:42:01.475
to she that you like.

997
00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:02.694
I cannot go to Australia.

998
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:04.478
I do not speak that language.

999
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:06.219
Oi. I had to learn Megan.

1000
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:09.657
Like-oh-my-God. it's so
totally awesome. bye.

1001
00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:15.489
So are you telling me
that when we first met.

1002
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.318
you put the
hard words to me?

1003
00:42:18.448 --> 00:42:20.059
Uh. love. it's
just an expression.

1004
00:42:20.189 --> 00:42:21.495
Well. it doesn't
sound very romantic.

1005
00:42:21.626 --> 00:42:22.975
And it makes me wonder

1006
00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:24.367
what kind of country
we'll be living in.

1007
00:42:24.498 --> 00:42:27.762
Trust me.
you'll love it in Oz.

1008
00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:30.286
You'll never
want to come back.

1009
00:42:33.899 --> 00:42:35.248
And then they
called my name.

1010
00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:36.815
and I just about
had a heart attack.

1011
00:42:36.945 --> 00:42:38.643
And then I realized.
no. I can't die yet.

1012
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:41.820
I have to
strangle Megan first.

1013
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.039
Well. I remember
thinking. wait a minute.

1014
00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.825
she just told me she was
single like 15 minutes ago.

1015
00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:48.783
How did she
meet a guy so fast?

1016
00:42:48.914 --> 00:42:50.219
But don't worry.
I'm used to that.

1017
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.394
I've had women on
death row tell me.

1018
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:53.222
"You know what. Andy.

1019
00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:56.704
"I'm just not ready for
a relationship right now."

1020
00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:59.620
I'm kidding. she wasn't
really on death row. yet.

1021
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:02.667
I got a twisted sense of humor.
I told you that. remember?

1022
00:43:02.797 --> 00:43:03.581
It's probably why
I'm still single.

1023
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:05.495
I know. huge shock. huge.

1024
00:43:05.626 --> 00:43:07.672
Actually. I am surprised.

1025
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:09.151
No. really.

1026
00:43:09.282 --> 00:43:10.936
You're funny.
you're very nice.

1027
00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:13.503
Not that word.

1028
00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:14.592
What word?

1029
00:43:14.722 --> 00:43:16.463
Nice.

1030
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.421
Yeah. it's usually followed
by the dropping of an F-bomb.

1031
00:43:19.988 --> 00:43:21.381
Friends.

1032
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:23.339
Come on. you know
it's true. right?

1033
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.821
Hey. Andy. you're really nice.
but let's just be friends.

1034
00:43:26.952 --> 00:43:28.257
It's a zone.

1035
00:43:28.388 --> 00:43:30.433
Yep. women want
the bad boy.

1036
00:43:30.564 --> 00:43:31.783
Well. that's not true.

1037
00:43:31.913 --> 00:43:33.001
Really?

1038
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:35.569
Okay. please
look at exhibit A.

1039
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.570
Look at his face.

1040
00:43:36.701 --> 00:43:37.919
Exhibit A. B. C.

1041
00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:41.009
None of them are smiling.

1042
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.489
They're all going for
this police line-up look.

1043
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.969
Okay. they're like.

1044
00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:45.753
"Hey Baby.
you wanna go on a date?

1045
00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:48.364
"Could end up in the
back of a cop car

1046
00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:49.539
"and I'll write
a song about it."

1047
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.454
That sounds very appealing.

1048
00:43:51.585 --> 00:43:52.586
But it sells.

1049
00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.283
Listen. bad boys
are exciting. right?

1050
00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:55.807
Nice guys are not.

1051
00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:57.983
Woman want the challenge
of taming the bad boy.

1052
00:43:58.113 --> 00:43:59.680
Nice guys are already tame.
there's no challenge.

1053
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.334
Okay. well. what
about bad girls?

1054
00:44:01.464 --> 00:44:02.770
What about 'em?

1055
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:08.558
Other than.
well. God bless 'em.

1056
00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:12.780
I think that men
want the bad girls.

1057
00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:17.350
Well. good.

1058
00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:20.788
You know what?

1059
00:44:20.919 --> 00:44:22.311
I think men are just
trying to get a girl.

1060
00:44:22.442 --> 00:44:24.966
And it's hard. good or bad.

1061
00:44:25.097 --> 00:44:26.489
Well. if you feel
that way. Andy.

1062
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.449
then why don't you
just become a bad boy?

1063
00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:31.103
You know what?

1064
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:32.452
I try.

1065
00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:33.627
How?

1066
00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:35.020
I drink straight
outta the carton.

1067
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.369
Come on.

1068
00:44:36.499 --> 00:44:37.849
Yeah. I don't
even use the glass.

1069
00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:39.677
I'll have an After Eight
dinner mint at five-thirty.

1070
00:44:39.807 --> 00:44:40.808
I don't care.

1071
00:44:40.939 --> 00:44:42.114
Yeah. you know what?

1072
00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:45.334
I'm going to try the
face. brace yourself.

1073
00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:52.341
That's terrifying.

1074
00:44:52.472 --> 00:44:55.214
I can't do it.

1075
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:56.389
Good.

1076
00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:57.999
Women don't
want a bad guy.

1077
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.479
The problem is

1078
00:44:59.609 --> 00:45:02.003
that most nice guys are
too shy to ask us out.

1079
00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:06.355
Trust me. Andy.
stay the way you are.

1080
00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:07.574
Uh huh.

1081
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.315
No. I'm serious.

1082
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:11.404
Women want a man like you.

1083
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.286
So you notice how
I put him in front?

1084
00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:26.941
Yeah. she was nine
months pregnant.

1085
00:45:27.072 --> 00:45:30.684
Practically had to use a fish
eye lens to take a picture.

1086
00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:34.819
Yeah. they would not
speak to each other.

1087
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:36.864
Not even sure if they're
together anymore.

1088
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:38.561
I mean.
God only knows how many

1089
00:45:38.692 --> 00:45:40.650
of these couples
are still together.

1090
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.609
See. marriage in and
of itself is beautiful.

1091
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.611
The marriage industry. whew!

1092
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.047
That's another machine.

1093
00:45:46.178 --> 00:45:47.005
I mean. what kind of
business can survive

1094
00:45:47.135 --> 00:45:48.528
on a 50% failure rate?

1095
00:45:48.658 --> 00:45:50.443
But it just keeps on thriving.

1096
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:53.489
It's the repeat business
that keeps it going.

1097
00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:56.710
How about yourself.
you ever been married?

1098
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:57.755
No.

1099
00:45:57.885 --> 00:45:58.756
How about you?

1100
00:45:58.886 --> 00:46:00.366
No.

1101
00:46:00.496 --> 00:46:02.760
I could've been married twice.

1102
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.370
I backed out both times.

1103
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.719
Why. were they nice?

1104
00:46:06.851 --> 00:46:08.417
Sorry. I'm sorry!

1105
00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:10.680
It's a family habit.
I can't help myself.

1106
00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.944
Okay. I think I understand now

1107
00:46:13.074 --> 00:46:15.076
why you didn't marry those men.

1108
00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:16.251
They didn't survive
the engagement.

1109
00:46:25.608 --> 00:46:28.916
Kate and Raoul getting
pictures taken today?

1110
00:46:29.047 --> 00:46:30.352
I don't think so.

1111
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.140
Hey. you know what?

1112
00:46:37.969 --> 00:46:40.493
Maybe you would be
interested in meeting Paul.

1113
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:42.495
He's a fitness instructor.

1114
00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:45.324
pretty smart when
it comes to fitness.

1115
00:46:45.454 --> 00:46:48.370
Anyway. he's five minutes
away. you wanna go meet him?

1116
00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:49.719
You mean today. like now?

1117
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:50.720
Yeah. today. like now.

1118
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:52.505
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1119
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:54.159
I mean. I'm dressed for
work. not to meet someone.

1120
00:46:54.289 --> 00:46:56.204
You look great.

1121
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.553
Not today.

1122
00:46:57.684 --> 00:46:58.467
You don't have much time.

1123
00:46:58.598 --> 00:46:59.773
I mean. you got two weeks

1124
00:46:59.904 --> 00:47:00.948
before you have to
break up with someone.

1125
00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:04.430
I know. I know.
but what if he says no?

1126
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.171
To pretending to marry you?

1127
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.781
What kind of guy
would say no to that?

1128
00:47:07.912 --> 00:47:10.262
No. c'mon. c'mon. it's not far.

1129
00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.785
C'mon.

1130
00:47:18.531 --> 00:47:19.706
I mean he's
a physical trainer.

1131
00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.316
but he's not like
a mean fitness guy.

1132
00:47:21.447 --> 00:47:23.579
He's not like "Hey. your
earlobes are soft and squishy.

1133
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.451
"get down and give
me 1.000 push-ups!

1134
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:27.366
"Do it!"

1135
00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:30.238
I never thought
about them before.

1136
00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:31.457
Another thing to worry
about when I meet him.

1137
00:47:31.587 --> 00:47:32.850
Thanks a lot.

1138
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.286
You're okay.

1139
00:47:34.416 --> 00:47:37.071
Andy. I don't usually go
for that macho man type.

1140
00:47:37.202 --> 00:47:38.029
Never have.

1141
00:47:41.206 --> 00:47:43.164
Okay. okay. I got a plan.

1142
00:47:43.295 --> 00:47:44.905
All right. I'll go in
first and I'll talk to him.

1143
00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:47.125
All right. you just check
him out from a distance.

1144
00:47:47.255 --> 00:47:49.475
And if you don't want
me to introduce you.

1145
00:47:49.605 --> 00:47:51.303
then give me a signal.

1146
00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.391
Okay. like?

1147
00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:55.394
Yeah. that works.

1148
00:47:55.524 --> 00:47:56.874
So if you do that. then
I won't introduce you.

1149
00:47:57.004 --> 00:47:58.876
So if I don't
like him. I do this?

1150
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:01.530
- Uh huh.
- But what if I do like him?

1151
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.184
Just come over and
say hi or talk to him.

1152
00:48:03.315 --> 00:48:04.272
Or tackle him?

1153
00:48:06.231 --> 00:48:07.319
- Okay.
- Okay.

1154
00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:09.756
- All right.
- All right. let's do this.

1155
00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.411
But they are
soft and squishy!

1156
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:20.680
He's never not here. so...

1157
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:21.724
Okay.

1158
00:48:23.161 --> 00:48:24.902
There he is.

1159
00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:31.386
Hey. Paul.

1160
00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:34.302
Yo. Andy!
What's up. dog?

1161
00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:35.521
What's up. bro.
you chilling?

1162
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:36.609
You maxin'
relaxin' or what?

1163
00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:39.264
Yeah. just maxin'
relaxin' all cool.

1164
00:48:39.394 --> 00:48:41.135
Shooting some B-ball out.

1165
00:48:41.266 --> 00:48:42.571
Yeah. you know what?

1166
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.226
It's good to see you.
I'm gonna go.

1167
00:48:45.357 --> 00:48:46.358
Oh. hi.

1168
00:48:46.488 --> 00:48:48.316
Hi.

1169
00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:49.317
Oh.

1170
00:48:53.191 --> 00:48:55.628
Hi. Paul Thompson.
this is Kate Wilde.

1171
00:48:55.758 --> 00:48:56.672
Hi. Kate.

1172
00:48:56.803 --> 00:48:57.630
It's nice to meet you.

1173
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.631
Hi. Paul.

1174
00:49:00.546 --> 00:49:02.156
Oh. is this a shoot?

1175
00:49:02.287 --> 00:49:03.157
Where's your camera?

1176
00:49:03.288 --> 00:49:04.202
No. no. I'm not working.

1177
00:49:04.332 --> 00:49:05.333
Oh.

1178
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:07.292
I didn't think
you were a model.

1179
00:49:07.422 --> 00:49:09.816
Well. I mean. you're not
dressed for a booty call.

1180
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.210
And you don't
have that fake bored

1181
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.473
"why is everybody staring
at me" look on your face.

1182
00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:16.649
Oh. no.

1183
00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:21.480
So what
brings you two in?

1184
00:49:23.395 --> 00:49:24.700
Andy.

1185
00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:25.701
Um.

1186
00:49:29.053 --> 00:49:29.967
Yeah?

1187
00:49:30.097 --> 00:49:30.968
Yeah.

1188
00:49:31.098 --> 00:49:32.447
Yeah.

1189
00:49:32.578 --> 00:49:37.757
Paul. listen. this could
come across really awesome.

1190
00:49:37.887 --> 00:49:39.063
This could be awesome.

1191
00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:40.455
Hey. would you be
interested in pretending

1192
00:49:40.586 --> 00:49:41.935
to be Kate's fiance?

1193
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:43.067
I mean. you'd have
a fake name. of course.

1194
00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:47.332
like Raoul DeCredenza.

1195
00:49:47.462 --> 00:49:49.334
What are you two up to?

1196
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:56.123
Kinda like.
acting in a play?

1197
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:57.429
Yeah.

1198
00:49:57.559 --> 00:49:59.518
I'll be the groom.
and she's the bride?

1199
00:49:59.648 --> 00:50:02.564
Yeah. I mean. unless
you want to switch roles.

1200
00:50:02.695 --> 00:50:05.263
We could lengthen the dress.
shorten the pants.

1201
00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:08.353
I mean. would your
girlfriend or wife mind?

1202
00:50:08.483 --> 00:50:10.529
Oh. no. no.
they wouldn't care.

1203
00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:11.573
I'm just kidding.
I'm single.

1204
00:50:11.704 --> 00:50:12.618
Oh!

1205
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:17.057
So Raoul DeCredenza?

1206
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:18.058
Uh huh.

1207
00:50:19.407 --> 00:50:20.626
Yeah. that could be cool.

1208
00:50:20.756 --> 00:50:21.714
I am an actor.

1209
00:50:21.844 --> 00:50:23.498
I do a little bit of bit parts.

1210
00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:26.501
You know. like this bit.
like that bit. like this bit.

1211
00:50:26.632 --> 00:50:28.025
Little body doubling. you know?

1212
00:50:28.155 --> 00:50:29.939
Yeah. Paul's been an ass
in a couple movies now.

1213
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:30.940
Oh.

1214
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:32.333
So two weeks. huh?

1215
00:50:32.464 --> 00:50:33.769
Sure. if you want.

1216
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.162
Sorry?

1217
00:50:35.293 --> 00:50:36.772
I mean. yes. until
my sister leaves.

1218
00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:39.297
Then we'd break up.

1219
00:50:39.427 --> 00:50:40.907
Huh.

1220
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.169
All right. let's do it.

1221
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.823
Could be fun.

1222
00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:45.390
Besides. we wouldn't have to
go through with the real deal.

1223
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.434
Oh. no.

1224
00:50:47.914 --> 00:50:49.350
Well.

1225
00:50:49.481 --> 00:50:53.702
And. Kate. you look good
now. but two weeks with me.

1226
00:50:53.833 --> 00:50:56.401
maybe you'll get in
better shape. right?

1227
00:50:56.531 --> 00:50:58.098
We're gonna go.

1228
00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:00.274
- Yeah. thanks.
- Sounds great.

1229
00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:01.493
- Yeah.
- Next time.

1230
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:02.581
Yeah.

1231
00:51:03.712 --> 00:51:04.583
Bye. Paul.

1232
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.675
Back that way.

1233
00:51:09.805 --> 00:51:10.806
Yeah. later.

1234
00:51:13.244 --> 00:51:15.072
Raoul DeCredenza.

1235
00:51:16.638 --> 00:51:17.552
Yeah.

1236
00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:21.948
Might get in better shape?

1237
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.602
What did he mean by that?

1238
00:51:23.732 --> 00:51:25.560
It's his job.
he trains people. I...

1239
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:26.822
He shouldn't
have said that.

1240
00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:28.215
I mean. he said you
looked good though. right?

1241
00:51:28.346 --> 00:51:31.610
So. other than that.
what'd you think?

1242
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.048
Well. other than
calling me fat?

1243
00:51:35.179 --> 00:51:36.745
Yeah. he's nice.

1244
00:51:36.876 --> 00:51:38.486
Oh. well. I guess when
you're a Viking warrior god.

1245
00:51:38.617 --> 00:51:39.661
you can afford to be nice.

1246
00:51:39.792 --> 00:51:41.010
Well. we'll see.

1247
00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:42.447
I mean. yes. he is
very attractive.

1248
00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:44.362
but I don't judge a man
based on looks alone.

1249
00:51:44.492 --> 00:51:45.319
Oh.

1250
00:51:46.712 --> 00:51:47.887
Uh. Kate?

1251
00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:48.888
Yeah.

1252
00:51:49.018 --> 00:51:50.107
Yeah.

1253
00:51:56.722 --> 00:51:58.245
Okay. start from
the beginning.

1254
00:51:58.376 --> 00:51:59.638
He is so beautiful.

1255
00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:02.249
Incredible eyes.
amazing smile.

1256
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.337
And his bod?

1257
00:52:03.468 --> 00:52:06.079
Oh my god.

1258
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.080
Wow.

1259
00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:08.690
It's like the statue of David.

1260
00:52:08.821 --> 00:52:10.779
Except with arms.

1261
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:12.477
That's the Venus de Milo.

1262
00:52:12.607 --> 00:52:13.739
Oh. whatever.

1263
00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:15.219
Tell me more.

1264
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:16.568
Okay. well. you
know how I hate

1265
00:52:16.698 --> 00:52:18.570
when guys are like
"Yo dog. wus'up bro?"

1266
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.701
Oh. yeah.

1267
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:21.094
Well. he did that.

1268
00:52:21.225 --> 00:52:22.574
and I just stood there
smiling in a daze. like--

1269
00:52:22.704 --> 00:52:24.010
Like you lost your
mind and became me?

1270
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.098
Exactly.

1271
00:52:25.229 --> 00:52:26.752
Megs.
this is ridiculous!

1272
00:52:26.882 --> 00:52:28.841
This is just a
physical attraction

1273
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:30.538
that isn't
going anywhere.

1274
00:52:30.669 --> 00:52:32.279
The smartest thing I could
do is simply walk away

1275
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.020
and never look back.

1276
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.935
So when you seeing him?

1277
00:52:36.065 --> 00:52:37.066
Noon tomorrow.

1278
00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:38.546
So we have to go
shopping like now.

1279
00:52:38.677 --> 00:52:40.505
I know the perfect place.

1280
00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:53.692
Andy?

1281
00:52:55.084 --> 00:52:55.998
Andy. it's Kate.

1282
00:52:56.129 --> 00:52:57.043
Yeah.

1283
00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:02.440
- Yeah. hi.
- Hi.

1284
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.311
Wow.

1285
00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:05.312
You look beautiful.

1286
00:53:05.443 --> 00:53:06.313
Oh. thanks.

1287
00:53:06.444 --> 00:53:08.402
Is Paul here yet?

1288
00:53:08.533 --> 00:53:09.751
- No.
- Good.

1289
00:53:18.456 --> 00:53:19.544
What?

1290
00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:20.545
Nothing.

1291
00:53:23.765 --> 00:53:24.940
Kate isn't here right now.

1292
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:26.333
I can take a message.

1293
00:53:26.464 --> 00:53:27.465
Your name is?

1294
00:53:27.595 --> 00:53:28.422
Oh. no. that's okay.

1295
00:53:28.553 --> 00:53:30.337
It's not about work.

1296
00:53:30.468 --> 00:53:32.992
I just wanted to make sure
that I had the right Kate Wilde

1297
00:53:33.122 --> 00:53:34.950
to send a wedding present to.

1298
00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:38.780
This is her. correct?

1299
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:40.826
Yes.
Yes. that's Kate.

1300
00:53:40.956 --> 00:53:44.917
Oh. so you've
seen this before?

1301
00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:46.658
Sure have.
Big surprise.

1302
00:53:46.788 --> 00:53:48.790
Really?

1303
00:53:48.921 --> 00:53:49.791
Why?

1304
00:53:51.445 --> 00:53:52.751
- Well-
- Uh huh?

1305
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:53.882
First time
any of us heard--

1306
00:53:54.013 --> 00:53:56.015
Uh huh?

1307
00:53:56.145 --> 00:53:58.104
Uh huh?!

1308
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.237
Uh. sorry. how
do you know Kate?

1309
00:54:00.367 --> 00:54:02.804
Damn thing.

1310
00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:04.806
It just never stops.

1311
00:54:04.937 --> 00:54:08.288
I gotta take this.
so I'm gonna come back later.

1312
00:54:08.419 --> 00:54:09.724
Thanks. little girl.

1313
00:54:25.044 --> 00:54:26.915
Maybe he changed his mind.

1314
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:30.136
Maybe his battery
died. I don't know.

1315
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:34.662
Did you take these?

1316
00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:37.056
Yeah. yeah.
it's my more artsy side.

1317
00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:38.884
Too bad it doesn't
pay the bills. huh?

1318
00:54:39.014 --> 00:54:40.668
They're beautiful.

1319
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:42.366
Thank you.

1320
00:54:42.496 --> 00:54:43.584
I tend to use film
for a lot of 'em

1321
00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:46.283
just cause it has a
better look. you know?

1322
00:54:46.413 --> 00:54:48.154
- You still use film?
- Yeah. absolutely.

1323
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.938
I mean. every time I go in.
all the photographers.

1324
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:51.549
the young guys.
they're always like.

1325
00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:53.855
"I thought an asteroid
took you all out."

1326
00:54:53.986 --> 00:54:58.207
I'm like no. just let
me buy the film. please.

1327
00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:01.863
So. then I go out
in the wild and I just shoot.

1328
00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:03.822
I love it.
I live for it.

1329
00:55:03.952 --> 00:55:05.084
It must be great
to have something

1330
00:55:05.214 --> 00:55:08.087
that you're so
passionate about.

1331
00:55:08.217 --> 00:55:09.958
Yeah.

1332
00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:11.395
Sometimes it costs a lot.

1333
00:55:20.229 --> 00:55:21.883
Don't worry.
he's coming.

1334
00:55:22.014 --> 00:55:23.624
- You sure?
- Oh yeah.

1335
00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:26.105
I got a shiny camera
and light set up.

1336
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:27.933
Guaranteed.
he's on his way.

1337
00:55:37.725 --> 00:55:40.641
I start work on Monday.
so it'll be a short honeymoon.

1338
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:44.341
but I reckon Christmas
break. we can hit Bondi?

1339
00:55:44.471 --> 00:55:46.908
Beautiful bonzer
beach. you'll love it.

1340
00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:48.432
The beach at Christmas?

1341
00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:50.912
Love. you'll be roasting.

1342
00:55:51.043 --> 00:55:54.046
But Christmas is supposed
to be cold and snowing.

1343
00:55:54.176 --> 00:55:56.222
Not back home. it isn't.

1344
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:59.530
Ah. sun-block and a
floppy hat. no worries.

1345
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.969
Um. I've been thinking.

1346
00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:05.579
Oi. what now. love?

1347
00:56:08.408 --> 00:56:14.458
What if. after we get married.
we go to Australia later?

1348
00:56:14.588 --> 00:56:16.982
Honey. you know we
can't go back later.

1349
00:56:17.112 --> 00:56:19.071
Even with us married. I still
have to leave this country.

1350
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:20.899
But I can come later.

1351
00:56:22.988 --> 00:56:24.206
Of course. I'm still
gonna come and meet you.

1352
00:56:24.337 --> 00:56:28.950
it's just not quite yet.

1353
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:32.693
Look. I love you. and
I want to be your wife.

1354
00:56:32.824 --> 00:56:34.782
- But--
- You're a little nervous.

1355
00:56:34.913 --> 00:56:36.480
I'm a lot nervous.

1356
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.657
I lose one more nerve.
I go up to panic.

1357
00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:42.399
And. and when would
you come join me?

1358
00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:44.705
How long would it take
for you to be ready?

1359
00:56:44.836 --> 00:56:45.750
I...

1360
00:56:47.142 --> 00:56:48.056
I don't know.

1361
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:51.930
What if we go to Hawaii?

1362
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.280
It's a state.
it's about halfway.

1363
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:55.324
I looked at a map.

1364
00:56:55.455 --> 00:56:56.848
Megan. I understand.

1365
00:56:56.978 --> 00:56:59.372
It's a big change.
and a big move.

1366
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:01.330
But we can't get married

1367
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:03.420
and then live on two
different bloody continents.

1368
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.427
I love you.

1369
00:57:10.557 --> 00:57:14.431
And I want you on that
plane beside me. as my wife.

1370
00:57:16.128 --> 00:57:18.435
So. you have to decide.

1371
00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:28.706
He is so rude.
He's not coming.

1372
00:57:28.836 --> 00:57:31.360
He's coming. I just
turned the light on.

1373
00:57:31.491 --> 00:57:32.753
I have a craft table.

1374
00:57:32.884 --> 00:57:33.754
Hey guys!

1375
00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:36.627
Sorry I'm late.

1376
00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:37.802
Yeah. just really wanted
to rock it for your photos.

1377
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:39.281
Oh. you are rocking it.

1378
00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:40.544
Thanks.

1379
00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:41.675
All right.

1380
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:43.677
Speaking of
hitting it. Andy.

1381
00:57:43.808 --> 00:57:45.157
thought you said Kate
over here wasn't a model.

1382
00:57:45.287 --> 00:57:46.680
Oh. she's not.
she was here on time.

1383
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:48.682
Oh. Andy. come on.
no. I don't care.

1384
00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:50.379
It's totally fine.

1385
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:51.380
I am ready.

1386
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.601
All right.

1387
00:57:54.732 --> 00:57:56.168
Oh. wow. what is that cologne?

1388
00:57:56.298 --> 00:57:57.561
It smells fantastic.

1389
00:57:57.691 --> 00:58:00.085
That's Contraction.

1390
00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:01.173
Contraception.

1391
00:58:01.303 --> 00:58:02.087
Something like that.

1392
00:58:02.217 --> 00:58:03.131
Contradiction?

1393
00:58:03.262 --> 00:58:04.263
Yeah. that's it.

1394
00:58:04.393 --> 00:58:05.569
Yeah. I'm wearing
it right now.

1395
00:58:05.699 --> 00:58:07.092
One time. I did
this department store

1396
00:58:07.222 --> 00:58:08.572
publicity
thing for them.

1397
00:58:08.702 --> 00:58:10.530
You know. spritzing people
as they were walking by.

1398
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:11.966
I was in
a suit and tie.

1399
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:14.708
the girls were dressed
like Hooter girls.

1400
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:16.797
That's hardly sexist. huh?

1401
00:58:16.928 --> 00:58:17.972
Yeah. they were
telling the guys.

1402
00:58:18.103 --> 00:58:20.366
wear this and you'll
get that lucky lady.

1403
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:21.759
And to the girls.

1404
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:24.675
wear this and you'll
get that rich guy.

1405
00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:26.328
I should probably stop
wearing that stuff then.

1406
00:58:26.459 --> 00:58:27.547
You were wearing
a suit and tie?

1407
00:58:27.678 --> 00:58:29.506
Yeah.

1408
00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:31.377
Anyway. they gave me
a bucket of the stuff.

1409
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:33.335
You guys want some.
you let me know.

1410
00:58:33.466 --> 00:58:34.467
Okay.

1411
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:35.424
So what are we doing today?

1412
00:58:35.555 --> 00:58:36.948
Happy couple shots.

1413
00:58:37.078 --> 00:58:37.905
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1414
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:41.213
Okay.

1415
00:58:41.343 --> 00:58:42.214
Like this.

1416
00:58:44.564 --> 00:58:46.653
I do these
romance novel shoots.

1417
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:49.134
With the hair-flying Barbarian
and the Princess stuff?

1418
00:58:49.264 --> 00:58:50.527
Right.

1419
00:58:50.657 --> 00:58:52.180
Do you like that stuff?

1420
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:55.183
Ah. it's okay.

1421
00:58:55.314 --> 00:58:57.011
It's weird 'cause they
just take my photos

1422
00:58:57.142 --> 00:58:58.665
and turn 'em into drawings.

1423
00:58:58.796 --> 00:59:00.841
Do you enjoy that stuff or?

1424
00:59:00.972 --> 00:59:02.930
Depends on how
hot the girl is.

1425
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:04.758
Half the time they're
fresh out of high school.

1426
00:59:04.889 --> 00:59:06.238
not much
to talk about.

1427
00:59:06.368 --> 00:59:08.109
Besides. I'm standing
there in my underwear.

1428
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.243
holding this plastic sword.
feeling like a tool.

1429
00:59:11.373 --> 00:59:13.506
Yeah. I'll bet.

1430
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.116
So what do you do?

1431
00:59:15.247 --> 00:59:16.204
Real estate legal work.

1432
00:59:16.335 --> 00:59:18.250
Compared to what
you do. it's boring.

1433
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.731
Oh. but you got brains.
you're smart.

1434
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:24.169
Me. I get a pimple.
or slack off on training.

1435
00:59:24.299 --> 00:59:25.562
I'm out of work.

1436
00:59:25.692 --> 00:59:27.085
Speaking of work. just
right in the lens. please.

1437
00:59:27.215 --> 00:59:28.086
Right here.

1438
00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:32.481
Uh. Paul. you gotta smile. okay?

1439
00:59:32.612 --> 00:59:33.744
There it is. happy couple.

1440
00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:35.310
Sorry. I'm not
used to smiling.

1441
00:59:35.441 --> 00:59:36.660
Everybody wants that
bad boy look. you know?

1442
00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:39.010
Oh. Kate doesn't
like bad boys.

1443
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.925
No.

1444
00:59:41.055 --> 00:59:42.753
Okay.

1445
00:59:42.883 --> 00:59:44.276
So. hey. tilt your
head back when you smile.

1446
00:59:44.406 --> 00:59:45.886
Oh. right.

1447
00:59:46.017 --> 00:59:48.541
Let the light sparkle in your
eyes. reduce the shadows.

1448
00:59:48.672 --> 00:59:49.716
Yeah.

1449
00:59:49.847 --> 00:59:50.630
There it is.

1450
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.414
Okay. next.

1451
00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:53.633
Just back up a little.
you're in my light.

1452
00:59:53.764 --> 00:59:54.982
Oh. I'm so sorry.
first time.

1453
00:59:55.113 --> 00:59:55.896
Oh. no.
you're doing great.

1454
00:59:56.027 --> 00:59:56.897
Doing great.

1455
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.250
Mr. Hines?

1456
01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:03.512
Yes. Kari?

1457
01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:05.514
It's Joanne McKenzie again.

1458
01:00:05.645 --> 01:00:07.908
The wedding conspiracy lady.

1459
01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:13.740
Tell her I'm busy.

1460
01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:16.700
She said she'll wait all day.

1461
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:19.093
Tell her I'm busy all day.

1462
01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:24.229
I should get danger pay.

1463
01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:26.100
And nobody at her work knew

1464
01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:29.234
until they saw that
picture in the paper. okay?

1465
01:00:29.364 --> 01:00:30.365
Because she wasn't
getting married

1466
01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:33.107
until she won that contest!

1467
01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:35.806
She was
just pretending.

1468
01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:36.850
You get that?

1469
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:37.938
Yeah.

1470
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:39.636
Yes. yes. ma'am.

1471
01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:40.898
Sorry. I just have to--

1472
01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:42.247
Read it back to me. okay?

1473
01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:43.727
Just read it back to me.

1474
01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:45.119
All of it.

1475
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.381
I want to make sure
you didn't screw it up

1476
01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:47.644
before your boss gets this.

1477
01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:50.951
Hello?

1478
01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:52.953
Hello?

1479
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:54.955
Hello?

1480
01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:02.920
You won't be smiling

1481
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.878
when I rain all over
your cheating parade.

1482
01:01:13.321 --> 01:01:16.150
A quarter turn to the right.
show a slight profile.

1483
01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:18.457
And lean back to
tighten the abs.

1484
01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:20.459
Okay. that looks...

1485
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:22.113
Okay. we're not selling
underwear though.

1486
01:01:22.243 --> 01:01:23.941
I know. sorry.

1487
01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:26.683
Hey. I been thinking
about this Raoul guy.

1488
01:01:26.813 --> 01:01:29.381
I'm seeing him as a
sort of an adventurer.

1489
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:30.730
He's got this look

1490
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:34.038
like he's always on the
look-out for danger.

1491
01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:36.736
Oh. what if he's always on
the look-out for Kate Wilde?

1492
01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.346
Yeah.

1493
01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:39.608
And then maybe just really
wanted to get to know her

1494
01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:41.132
and then talk with her and
maybe one day marry her.

1495
01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:45.049
Yeah. use that.

1496
01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:46.528
Oh. sorry. I thought
you were kidding.

1497
01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.052
No.

1498
01:01:50.968 --> 01:01:52.186
You know what.
just look at her

1499
01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:54.711
the way that
she's looking at you.

1500
01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:57.844
Like this?

1501
01:01:57.975 --> 01:01:59.846
Uh-huh.

1502
01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:01.239
Yeah.

1503
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.074
So. she's single.

1504
01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:17.908
Oh. congratulations in quotation
marks. and then "wink. wink".

1505
01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:25.567
Well. soon. I'll be
sipping on champagne.

1506
01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:33.750
What else we got?

1507
01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:37.579
Nice. okay. next?

1508
01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:45.805
Okay. I'm going to go
have a look at those.

1509
01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:47.415
- I'll be back.
- Right on. that rocked!

1510
01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:48.503
Yeah. it was great.

1511
01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.418
Awesome. good stuff.

1512
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:51.898
All right. see you later.

1513
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.899
Oh!

1514
01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:55.902
- Bye.
- Bye.

1515
01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:21.406
Hey. Kate.

1516
01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:22.973
He kissed me!

1517
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.539
Um. where?
I need deets.

1518
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:25.497
In the photo shop.

1519
01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:26.541
No. no. I mean where?

1520
01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:27.586
Like mouth. or cheek?

1521
01:03:27.716 --> 01:03:28.630
Mouth.

1522
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:29.588
Open or closed?

1523
01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:30.632
Closed.

1524
01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:31.590
For how long?

1525
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.939
Did it linger?

1526
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.724
No. But it wasn't
like Wham Bam. either.

1527
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:37.248
Just hang on a second.

1528
01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:38.292
Andy!

1529
01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:39.816
Yeah?

1530
01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:41.165
Thank you so much for today.

1531
01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:41.992
I have to get going.
but I'll see you tomorrow?

1532
01:03:42.122 --> 01:03:43.123
Yeah.

1533
01:03:43.254 --> 01:03:45.169
Where are you?
I'm coming over.

1534
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.737
Bye.

1535
01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:57.572
Thanks for everything. Andy.

1536
01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.661
It was a fun shoot.

1537
01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.098
So were his eyes open?

1538
01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:03.143
I think so.
It happened fast.

1539
01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.579
But we spent 20 minutes
holding each other

1540
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.451
and. oh. he smells so good.

1541
01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.192
And looking into
each other's eyes.

1542
01:04:08.322 --> 01:04:10.194
oh. he has beautiful eyes.

1543
01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:14.024
But what if he was just
acting. playing a part?

1544
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:16.678
Like he was supposed
to kiss me. so he did.

1545
01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:18.637
but he didn't actually mean it?

1546
01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:20.465
Well did he say anything
before the kiss?

1547
01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:24.251
Um. thank you. that was fun.

1548
01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:25.165
And after?

1549
01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:26.863
Uh...

1550
01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:29.822
See you later. see you
around. something like that.

1551
01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.737
The blood was kind of
roaring in my ears.

1552
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.738
Now I know what
people feel like

1553
01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.349
when they get
hit by lightning.

1554
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.785
But we are
meeting tomorrow

1555
01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.875
and doing a shoot
at a tuxedo shop.

1556
01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.354
A shoot. hey?

1557
01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:42.487
Is that what you. Cindy.
and Tyra call those things?

1558
01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:43.836
Megs. please.
this isn't funny.

1559
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.620
He's gonna show up
looking fantastic

1560
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:47.405
and I'm going to look like
some tongue-tied idiot

1561
01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:48.797
with fat earlobes.

1562
01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:52.149
Fat what?

1563
01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:54.238
Megs. supermodels
are the most

1564
01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:55.500
beautiful people
on the planet.

1565
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.067
Of course they kiss
each other all the time.

1566
01:04:57.197 --> 01:04:58.807
I mean. why wouldn't they?

1567
01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:01.767
So. maybe in their world.
it doesn't mean anything.

1568
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:04.248
Kate. a kiss always
means something.

1569
01:05:04.378 --> 01:05:05.597
Yeah. to us. it does.

1570
01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:07.164
But he's probably already
forgotten this kiss

1571
01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:09.296
that you and I are
dissecting to death.

1572
01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.689
I'm coming over right now.

1573
01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:11.951
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

1574
01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.049
Who is it?

1575
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.659
It's me. you putz. let me in!

1576
01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:28.750
What's wrong?

1577
01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:29.751
Nothing.

1578
01:05:29.882 --> 01:05:30.883
I'm fine.

1579
01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:33.451
Don't look at me
like that. Kate.

1580
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:34.582
Everything's all right.

1581
01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:35.932
You and Dave?

1582
01:05:40.284 --> 01:05:42.155
Oh. Megs.

1583
01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.435
Kate Wilde. legal department.

1584
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:02.697
Kate.

1585
01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:06.571
Hi. it's Kari.
assistant to Mr. Hines

1586
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:10.357
of Calgary Modern
Wedding magazine?

1587
01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:12.359
Your business gave
me this work number.

1588
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.970
Um. okay.

1589
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.624
Okay. we're having trouble
reaching Andy Swenson

1590
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:19.366
for a photo assignment.

1591
01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:22.891
Are you gonna be seeing
him today or tomorrow?

1592
01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.850
<i>Um. tomorrow
morning. at Topman's.</i>

1593
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:25.894
Topman's!

1594
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.811
Great. good.

1595
01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:31.596
We will give him a
call when you're done.

1596
01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:32.814
Have fun.

1597
01:06:32.945 --> 01:06:34.642
Okay. thank you. bye.

1598
01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:44.174
Oh. but you
won't be having fun.

1599
01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:46.393
I bet mommy and daddy don't
know nothing from nothing

1600
01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:48.004
about any of this.

1601
01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:04.150
20 minutes late and he
takes forever to get ready.

1602
01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:06.022
Yeah. you get used
to waiting on models.

1603
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.327
I can go get
him if you want.

1604
01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:09.503
Sorry. you two.

1605
01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:12.550
It's been a while since
I've been draped in gold.

1606
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.726
Am I hitting this or what?

1607
01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.075
Yes. you are.

1608
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:18.730
Oh my god.

1609
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.866
Oh my gosh.

1610
01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:26.607
Mom. Dad. what are
you doing here?

1611
01:07:26.738 --> 01:07:28.696
For the pictures.

1612
01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.307
What pictures?

1613
01:07:30.437 --> 01:07:32.526
The ones with your fiance.

1614
01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:34.267
When the heck were
you going to tell us?

1615
01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:35.225
Excuse me.

1616
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.356
What's going on?

1617
01:07:36.487 --> 01:07:37.618
How did you know I was here?

1618
01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:39.446
A woman called us.

1619
01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:42.406
From the marriage magazine.

1620
01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:43.842
Said you'd won some contest

1621
01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.235
and that we were to come here.

1622
01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:47.324
And get our pictures taken.

1623
01:07:47.454 --> 01:07:50.414
We couldn't believe it at first.

1624
01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:54.157
Until we saw that
picture on the Internet.

1625
01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:55.506
Picture?

1626
01:07:55.636 --> 01:07:57.551
What picture on the Internet?

1627
01:07:57.682 --> 01:07:59.162
Some little paper's website.

1628
01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:02.817
That lady told
us how to find it.

1629
01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:05.081
But. but. why
didn't you call me?

1630
01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:06.386
She asked us not to.

1631
01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:09.302
Said this was to
be a big surprise.

1632
01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:12.305
Oh. yes. it is.

1633
01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:14.655
We tried calling Megan. and
she's not answering her cell.

1634
01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:16.483
Ah.

1635
01:08:16.614 --> 01:08:18.790
Would you two just excuse
me just for one second?

1636
01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:22.402
We need to talk.

1637
01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:25.797
Are those your parents?

1638
01:08:25.927 --> 01:08:27.407
The people I called Mom and
Dad. yeah. they're my parents!

1639
01:08:27.538 --> 01:08:29.105
They're awesome.
What are they doing here?

1640
01:08:29.235 --> 01:08:30.454
I don't know.

1641
01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:31.890
But supposedly you're
taking their photo later.

1642
01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.021
I am?

1643
01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:35.111
I don't know
anything about that.

1644
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:38.549
Karma. honey.

1645
01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:41.465
When you lie and cheat.
it bites you in the butt.

1646
01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:42.857
How did you two meet?

1647
01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:44.207
You two don't...

1648
01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:45.469
What has Kate
told you about us?

1649
01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:46.818
Nothing.

1650
01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:51.127
By the way. may I say.
you are very handsome.

1651
01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:52.780
Are you a model?

1652
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:53.955
I am.

1653
01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:56.219
And a fitness trainer.

1654
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:59.439
I'm also a treasure
hunter in Central America.

1655
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:00.527
Really?

1656
01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:02.181
Wow.

1657
01:09:02.312 --> 01:09:03.922
Where in Central America?

1658
01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:06.490
Oh. all of it.

1659
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.708
- Oh.
- Oh.

1660
01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.363
It's a pleasure
to meet you two.

1661
01:09:10.494 --> 01:09:11.669
It's uh...

1662
01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:13.627
Unfortunately.
my parents couldn't be here.

1663
01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:16.935
They were killed
during the revolution.

1664
01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:18.763
Oh my heavens.

1665
01:09:18.893 --> 01:09:21.766
My Lord. which revolution?

1666
01:09:21.896 --> 01:09:23.724
The latest one.

1667
01:09:23.855 --> 01:09:25.378
There are so many.

1668
01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:26.771
Well. the magazine called
me earlier asking for you.

1669
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:28.207
so I know that you
talked to them.

1670
01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:29.817
I never talked to
the magazine. I swear.

1671
01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:31.210
Okay. well. someone
told my parents.

1672
01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:35.127
And if it wasn't you. or
me. or Megs. or Paul. who...

1673
01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.346
Oh gosh. Paul.

1674
01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:40.480
Diving in the shipwreck.
there were sharks everywhere.

1675
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:41.525
Paul.

1676
01:09:41.655 --> 01:09:43.614
Paul. what are you doing?

1677
01:09:43.744 --> 01:09:45.746
Just talking with your
lovely parents here.

1678
01:09:45.877 --> 01:09:48.401
Paul is the English
translation of my real name.

1679
01:09:48.532 --> 01:09:51.404
Raoul has been telling us
all about his adventures.

1680
01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:52.884
Really?

1681
01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:57.454
A model. a fitness trainer.
and a treasure hunter?

1682
01:09:57.584 --> 01:10:00.544
You sure our Kate won't be a
little bit too dull for you?

1683
01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:01.980
Thanks. dad.

1684
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:03.111
Paul. can we just talk
to you for a second?

1685
01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:04.287
Of course. darling.

1686
01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:05.723
We'll be right back. okay.

1687
01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:09.683
What do you think you're doing?

1688
01:10:09.814 --> 01:10:11.381
Being Raoul.
You asked me to.

1689
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:12.991
But not for my parents!

1690
01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:14.645
Why not?
What does it matter?

1691
01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:16.299
We're breaking
up soon anyway.

1692
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:18.039
That reminds me.
what if Raoul dies?

1693
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.040
He's fighting the rebels.

1694
01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:20.477
Paul.

1695
01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:23.044
Okay. a simple
break-up works too.

1696
01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:24.220
Look. I just can't
lie to my parents

1697
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.395
about getting married.

1698
01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:27.527
You're not. we're not.

1699
01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:30.704
Come on. just let me be
Raoul for a little bit.

1700
01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:34.055
Kate. I work in a sweaty.
stinky gym all day.

1701
01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:36.101
It sucks like dead ducks.

1702
01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:40.453
Just give me this
little bit of a fantasy.

1703
01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:43.282
I agreed to give
you yours. right?

1704
01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:45.545
Just tell your parents
that you won a contest.

1705
01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:47.068
and then met me.

1706
01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:48.418
We're just figuring things out.

1707
01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.811
That's all true so far.

1708
01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.161
Come on.
I'm enjoying this time.

1709
01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:54.511
Especially with you.

1710
01:10:58.558 --> 01:10:59.646
Hugging?

1711
01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:00.647
Kissing?

1712
01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.304
Please?

1713
01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:06.653
Everything all right?

1714
01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:08.002
Yep. yep!

1715
01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:09.656
Yes. it's good.
just one second.

1716
01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:15.488
So. how did you two meet?

1717
01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:18.796
Um...

1718
01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:20.667
Katherine. if I may.

1719
01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:22.495
We met after I'd returned

1720
01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:26.325
from under-the-sea treasure
hunting for Cortez's gold.

1721
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:27.848
Yeah. Paul. Raoul.

1722
01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:29.720
I don't think that my parents
are really interested.

1723
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.766
Oh. we are very interested.

1724
01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:35.421
So have you ever
found any treasures?

1725
01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:36.422
I have. yes.

1726
01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.424
The most precious one.

1727
01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:39.425
Your daughter.

1728
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.473
Now where was I?

1729
01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:45.388
Ah. Montezuma's gold.

1730
01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:47.346
Oh. great story.

1731
01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.306
Thought it
was Cortez's gold.

1732
01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:52.090
There is a lot of it.

1733
01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:52.960
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

1734
01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:54.614
I need my head examined!

1735
01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:56.834
Hey. I mean. your parents
seem to be quite taken

1736
01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:59.358
by Captain Jack
Sparrow over there.

1737
01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:01.273
You seem to be doing
quite well yourself. lass.

1738
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:02.318
With Raoul. yeah.

1739
01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:03.971
With Paul. I have no idea.

1740
01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.756
Andy. it's driving me crazy.

1741
01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:07.671
He wouldn't be doing Raoul
if he was serious about me.

1742
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.934
Raoul and I are breaking
up in two weeks.

1743
01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:11.414
Well. then maybe he just-

1744
01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:13.503
And you know. he's
kissed me twice now.

1745
01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:16.201
And then he said he's
enjoying this and me.

1746
01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.290
I just need to talk to someone.

1747
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.291
Sure.

1748
01:12:19.422 --> 01:12:20.988
Excuse me.

1749
01:12:21.119 --> 01:12:22.294
Megs. pick up.

1750
01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:23.251
Her phone's been
off for two hours.

1751
01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:24.818
where could she possibly go?

1752
01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:26.167
I don't know.

1753
01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:28.344
Oh. Megs.
about time. Listen.

1754
01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:30.171
No. no. no. me first.

1755
01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:31.521
Dave and I are getting married!

1756
01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:33.566
Uh. duh. I know that.

1757
01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:36.395
No. I mean. like we're
getting married this Sunday.

1758
01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:39.833
Civil ceremony.
10 o'clock. Bridgewood hall.

1759
01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:41.008
Sunday?

1760
01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.314
Like. in a few days from now?

1761
01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:43.489
Yes.

1762
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.448
We spent all morning
arranging it.

1763
01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:46.884
And right after that.

1764
01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:50.061
we're going to go on a week
long honeymoon in Hawaii.

1765
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.411
But I thought you guys
couldn't afford that.

1766
01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:53.456
We can't.

1767
01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:56.110
But we've gotta do this.

1768
01:12:56.241 --> 01:13:00.071
Kate. the wedding stress
was just tearing us apart.

1769
01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:02.552
And we forgot the
most important thing.

1770
01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:06.425
just us being together.

1771
01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:10.037
So. for seven days. we're
going to kick back. relax.

1772
01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:12.344
and just be happy.

1773
01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:13.606
But I can't talk right now.

1774
01:13:13.737 --> 01:13:15.434
I've gotta call Mom and Dad.

1775
01:13:15.565 --> 01:13:17.001
Oh. well. I can
do that for you.

1776
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:18.524
They're here with me and Paul.

1777
01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:19.612
What?

1778
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:20.657
It's a long story.

1779
01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:23.268
I don't have time.
I have to go.

1780
01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.443
Kate. hey.

1781
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:25.705
Raoul was just telling us

1782
01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:27.664
about now he nearly
escaped with his life

1783
01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:30.797
from a giant boulder and
it was kinda like a movie.

1784
01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.320
I'm sure it was.

1785
01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:35.106
Listen. everybody.
I have big news.

1786
01:13:35.236 --> 01:13:36.673
Wedding this Sunday.

1787
01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:37.891
Yeah. it's a little rushed.

1788
01:13:38.022 --> 01:13:40.416
but seven day
honeymoon in Hawaii.

1789
01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.113
Honeymoon in Hawaii?

1790
01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.637
It's at 10:00 a.m.. Bridgewood.

1791
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.790
Mr. Hines!

1792
01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.834
Mr. Hines!

1793
01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:10.228
It's me. Joanne McKenzie!

1794
01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:11.969
Remember?

1795
01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:15.929
The one who discovered the
fake dream wedding winner?

1796
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.758
I just need a
minute of your time!

1797
01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:20.586
Website said you
were open till five!

1798
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:23.371
I'm coming.
don't break my doors.

1799
01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:29.334
Kate knows that I'm on to her.

1800
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.640
That I'm getting
closer and closer

1801
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:32.555
to discovering
her little plot.

1802
01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:33.904
We have been through
this before. lady-

1803
01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:35.688
Just listen!

1804
01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:37.777
She's getting married
this Sunday. not in June.

1805
01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:38.865
What?

1806
01:14:38.996 --> 01:14:40.824
I heard it with
my own two ears.

1807
01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:42.695
So I think she's gonna
marry one of her friends.

1808
01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:45.045
go on a fantastic
Hawaiian holiday.

1809
01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.395
and then get
a quickie divorce.

1810
01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:50.050
You can come with me. see
for yourself. ask around.

1811
01:14:50.181 --> 01:14:53.314
In fact. you can even
ask Kate herself.

1812
01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:56.361
Joanne. good bye.
good night. get help.

1813
01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:02.193
If you don't.
I am going to go on TV.

1814
01:15:02.323 --> 01:15:04.804
I'm gonna tell the papers
that this contest is a fraud

1815
01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:06.763
and that you knew and
did nothing about it.

1816
01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:10.244
And then I'm going to sue
you and your little magazine.

1817
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.031
And if I go along with you?

1818
01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:16.512
No lawyers.
no paper. no TV.

1819
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:17.643
No more you?

1820
01:15:17.774 --> 01:15:19.819
No me. ever.

1821
01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:25.651
Why would Kate want a
cheapie civil ceremony

1822
01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:28.393
when she could have your
big. beautiful wedding?

1823
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.047
See what she says.

1824
01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:34.660
This Sunday?

1825
01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:37.402
Sunday.

1826
01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:45.062
Ms. McKenzie.

1827
01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:05.430
You know. mate. I was
the first Raoul DeCredenza.

1828
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:06.387
You were?

1829
01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:07.563
Yeah.

1830
01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:09.608
Got fired though.

1831
01:16:09.739 --> 01:16:11.654
Girls said I was
too good-looking.

1832
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:12.916
Yeah. I hear that.

1833
01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:16.484
After today. I think
Raoul's gonna disappear

1834
01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.530
into the Amazon
jungle or something.

1835
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:19.575
Paul. smile.

1836
01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:21.968
Just back up a little bit.

1837
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:27.974
Okay.

1838
01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:29.802
Oh. that's great. yeah.

1839
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:36.156
Oh my God.
he is gorgeous.

1840
01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:38.594
You mean your husband.
of course?

1841
01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:39.595
Uh. yeah. of course.

1842
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.555
Okay. how do I look?

1843
01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:44.600
Oh.

1844
01:16:46.123 --> 01:16:47.690
Oh. Katey.
don't make me cry.

1845
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.997
If my mascara runs I'm gonna
look like some goth chick.

1846
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:51.955
You ready?

1847
01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:54.653
Let's do this.

1848
01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:56.786
Okay.

1849
01:17:04.097 --> 01:17:04.924
About time!

1850
01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:05.969
Look.

1851
01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:11.409
It's a JP.
not a minister.

1852
01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:12.453
Come on.

1853
01:17:13.585 --> 01:17:14.891
Yeah. see. little faker.

1854
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:17.676
Even had the nerve
to wear white.

1855
01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:19.025
Oh dear. oh dear.

1856
01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:20.723
- Well?
- Well. what?

1857
01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:22.028
I see someone
getting married.

1858
01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.682
I see Andy
taking pictures.

1859
01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:25.162
Yeah. well.
they're in on it.

1860
01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:26.293
I saw them
plotting together.

1861
01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:27.468
That's enough.

1862
01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:29.079
Now I kept up my
end of the bargain.

1863
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:30.689
it's time for you
to do the same.

1864
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.256
No. no. no.
no. no. no. no!

1865
01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:33.431
Where you going?

1866
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:34.519
Home.

1867
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.347
I came.
I saw. I'm leaving.

1868
01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:38.479
If that's what they truly want.
I'm more than happy with it.

1869
01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:40.264
Wait. wait. wait. wait!

1870
01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:42.962
You haven't talked to anybody!

1871
01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:43.963
Lady. you need help.

1872
01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:45.008
Now let go.

1873
01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:50.666
Fine. The prize is mine
and I'll prove it!

1874
01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.669
All right. sister.
tell me the truth!

1875
01:17:56.715 --> 01:17:57.629
Who are you?

1876
01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.500
And why are you over there?

1877
01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:00.980
Are you bloody mad?
Get out!

1878
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:02.286
Bob?

1879
01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.288
Bob Hines. hi.

1880
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:05.332
What are you doing here?

1881
01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:06.377
He's with me.

1882
01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:08.509
Here to expose this fraud.

1883
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.337
This is a fake wedding.

1884
01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:14.298
No. actually.
we are getting married.

1885
01:18:14.428 --> 01:18:15.734
Who is she?

1886
01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.215
Stop it. stop it. stop it!

1887
01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:20.173
Everybody. please.

1888
01:18:20.304 --> 01:18:23.089
I'm terribly sorry. but
this is a tragic mistake.

1889
01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.090
Ask them.

1890
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.613
Ask her!

1891
01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:27.224
Will you be quiet.

1892
01:18:27.354 --> 01:18:28.878
You are so insane!

1893
01:18:30.793 --> 01:18:32.316
Where are you going
for your honeymoon?

1894
01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:34.144
We've going to Hawaii.

1895
01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.406
And which hotel?

1896
01:18:35.536 --> 01:18:38.409
Uh. it's a youth hostel.

1897
01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:41.194
Well. not anymore.

1898
01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:44.545
You're staying in a five star
hotel in a honeymoon suite.

1899
01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:47.548
Everything's paid for.
food. drinks. all paid for.

1900
01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:49.159
If you want to drink
champagne all day

1901
01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:51.857
and eat caviar all day. then
by all means. you go ahead.

1902
01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:52.945
Oh my gosh.

1903
01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:55.469
Thanks. mate.
Whoever you are.

1904
01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.428
And you. we're
leaving right now

1905
01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:59.386
or I'm calling the police.

1906
01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:00.910
No.

1907
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.869
They might be getting
married but she's not.

1908
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.479
Ask her!

1909
01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:08.395
I am so sorry
about all this.

1910
01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:09.962
It's just not fair!

1911
01:19:10.093 --> 01:19:11.181
It's not fair.
you're leaving.

1912
01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:12.748
She's not getting
married in June!

1913
01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:13.792
Wait.

1914
01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:16.360
She's right.

1915
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:17.404
I am?

1916
01:19:19.015 --> 01:19:19.929
I told you.

1917
01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.234
I told you. I knew it!

1918
01:19:21.365 --> 01:19:22.279
Really?

1919
01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:27.197
So. I get the prize.
like we discussed.

1920
01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:28.328
Yes.

1921
01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:29.547
I get the dream wedding!

1922
01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:30.635
Yes.

1923
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:31.897
You can have it.

1924
01:19:32.028 --> 01:19:32.898
I don't need it.

1925
01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:34.160
Yes!

1926
01:19:35.858 --> 01:19:37.424
Now. Myron can't
say no to me.

1927
01:19:37.555 --> 01:19:39.078
I'm going to
call him right now!

1928
01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:41.777
Ah. 'cause he's
such a cheap turd!

1929
01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:44.344
Wow.

1930
01:19:45.737 --> 01:19:47.086
Mr. Hines. no one
else knew about this.

1931
01:19:47.217 --> 01:19:48.914
it was all just me.

1932
01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:49.915
And me.

1933
01:19:51.264 --> 01:19:53.005
Me too.

1934
01:19:53.136 --> 01:19:54.528
Me three.

1935
01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:55.791
Uh. four.

1936
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.883
Kate. this was all my fault.

1937
01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:02.710
You can take back the
whole hotel thing.

1938
01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:04.451
It doesn't really
matter where we stay.

1939
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:05.801
Is it all true?

1940
01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:07.977
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1941
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.370
And Raoul?

1942
01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:12.677
Was he even real?

1943
01:20:15.245 --> 01:20:17.029
Well. sort of.

1944
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.030
I'm Paul.

1945
01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:20.511
But I play Raoul.

1946
01:20:22.078 --> 01:20:23.166
Hello. Raoul.

1947
01:20:27.561 --> 01:20:29.389
Mom and Dad. I'm so sorry.

1948
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.002
I'm not actually
getting married.

1949
01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:36.527
I thought it might
be too good to be true.

1950
01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:38.268
So this is how many now?

1951
01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:40.096
Oh. stop it!

1952
01:20:40.226 --> 01:20:41.619
Dad!

1953
01:20:41.749 --> 01:20:44.535
Runs in the bloody family.

1954
01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:46.885
Alright. everybody. Megan and
I still have to get married.

1955
01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:48.582
And we've got
a plane to catch.

1956
01:20:48.713 --> 01:20:51.890
So somebody
lock the bloody door

1957
01:20:52.021 --> 01:20:54.110
and let's do this.

1958
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.720
Yes. let's do this.

1959
01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:04.598
Here comes the bride. Myron!

1960
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:08.689
Pop the
champagne. baby!

1961
01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:17.960
Well. cheers to my baby
sister and her new husband.

1962
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.004
I hope they
at least got

1963
01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:21.485
matching bunk
beds in the hostel.

1964
01:21:21.615 --> 01:21:23.661
Of course. they could've been
at a five star luxury hotel

1965
01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:26.490
if I hadn't opened
my big fat mouth.

1966
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.319
Well. cheers to
big fat mouths.

1967
01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.711
Andy. you didn't
have to do that.

1968
01:21:30.842 --> 01:21:32.148
I wish you hadn't.

1969
01:21:32.278 --> 01:21:33.192
You say that now?

1970
01:21:36.674 --> 01:21:38.981
They all look so handsome.

1971
01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.460
Well. that's because
the photographer's

1972
01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:41.505
really. really good.

1973
01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:42.767
Oh.

1974
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.160
Yeah. I could probably
hook you guys up.

1975
01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:46.945
You're funny.

1976
01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:48.381
And very sweet.

1977
01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:56.389
Hello?

1978
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.304
S'up. Kate. it's Paul.

1979
01:21:58.435 --> 01:22:01.003
Oh. Paul. hi!

1980
01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:02.134
I'm just at
Andy's and we're

1981
01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:03.179
looking at some
wedding pictures

1982
01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:04.745
and having some wine.

1983
01:22:04.876 --> 01:22:05.921
A lot of wine.

1984
01:22:07.183 --> 01:22:09.489
Hey. Kate. I been thinking.

1985
01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.449
I really enjoyed being Raoul
and hanging out with you.

1986
01:22:12.579 --> 01:22:14.712
I was wondering if...

1987
01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.192
Yes?

1988
01:22:16.322 --> 01:22:18.498
Well. if you wanna
hang out sometime.

1989
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:20.370
You know.
nothing heavy. keep it cool.

1990
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.067
and see where it goes.

1991
01:22:25.114 --> 01:22:27.159
Are you at
the gym right now?

1992
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.466
Yeah. low reps.
little cardio.

1993
01:22:29.596 --> 01:22:31.076
You know.
just working it.

1994
01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.948
Your gym is
open at this hour?

1995
01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:35.602
No. no. no. no.
I'm alone.

1996
01:22:35.733 --> 01:22:37.604
Hey. you wanna come by
and work up a sweat?

1997
01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:41.565
You mean. work up a
sweat with no commitments?

1998
01:22:45.395 --> 01:22:46.700
Paul. are you standing
in front of a mirror

1999
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:49.442
with a spotlight
on you right now?

2000
01:22:49.573 --> 01:22:50.966
Can you see me?

2001
01:22:52.706 --> 01:22:54.708
No. I can't.

2002
01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:01.019
Actually...

2003
01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:07.156
I don't want to come
by and work up a sweat.

2004
01:23:07.286 --> 01:23:08.200
Oh.

2005
01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.550
Well. next time. maybe.

2006
01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:13.945
Yeah.

2007
01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:14.990
Later. maybe.

2008
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.490
I overheard
a little of that.

2009
01:23:37.621 --> 01:23:39.666
You okay?

2010
01:23:39.797 --> 01:23:40.928
Yeah.

2011
01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:42.017
I guess.

2012
01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.634
Hi.

2013
01:23:50.764 --> 01:23:52.331
Hi.

2014
01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:53.376
I uh...

2015
01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.075
I wrote
something for you.

2016
01:23:57.206 --> 01:24:02.080
So. I'm just gonna.

2017
01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:04.996
just gonna read it.

2018
01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:06.215
Roses are red.

2019
01:24:09.435 --> 01:24:11.307
and violets are blue.

2020
01:24:11.437 --> 01:24:13.831
I thought I'd try on this
bad boy jacket for you.

2021
01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:17.052
I thought about striking
a pose. you know.

2022
01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:20.577
or maybe changing my
voice. shaving my beard.

2023
01:24:20.707 --> 01:24:24.624
but to be honest. that
just all sounded weird.

2024
01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:26.452
Oddly enough. I had
a really good time

2025
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:29.760
trying to find
you another guy.

2026
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:33.633
but deep down inside I longed
for the two week finish line.

2027
01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:36.680
where you would break up

2028
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.161
because I felt like
I was the next guy.

2029
01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:40.945
the nice guy. in line.

2030
01:24:43.165 --> 01:24:47.082
And I just really wanted your
eyes to say hello to mine.

2031
01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:51.216
Now there was a
time you mentioned

2032
01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.305
that nice
guys were good.

2033
01:24:53.436 --> 01:24:55.264
but the problem was they
were too shy to ask girls out

2034
01:24:55.394 --> 01:24:58.832
and that.

2035
01:24:58.963 --> 01:25:01.792
that I understood.

2036
01:25:01.922 --> 01:25:04.577
I thought of all these
other things I could do.

2037
01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:09.930
But all I really want

2038
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:11.976
is to just sit and talk

2039
01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:17.112
and maybe share another
grilled cheese with you.

2040
01:25:20.071 --> 01:25:26.121
So. Kate. would you like
to go out with me sometime?

2041
01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:36.087
You know
what I realized?

2042
01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:37.132
What?

2043
01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.309
I don't really
like leather jackets.

2044
01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:41.527
No?

2045
01:25:41.658 --> 01:25:43.094
You know what. me neither.

2046
01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:44.051
Take that off.

2047
01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:46.576
I tried.

2048
01:25:46.706 --> 01:25:47.620
It was a good try.

2049
01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:48.665
Thanks.

2050
01:25:50.101 --> 01:25:52.321
You did all that for me?

2051
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:53.322
Yeah.

2052
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.845
You're a lucky man.

2053
01:26:38.976 --> 01:26:41.413
Hey. you brought us together.

2054
01:26:44.982 --> 01:26:47.419
Now step back.
you're in my light. bro.

2055
01:27:01.128 --> 01:27:02.478
Hi.

2056
01:27:02.608 --> 01:27:03.653
Hi.
