00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.279
Thanks. Wikipedia.

201
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.440
Abby. it's worse than
what you're saying.

202
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.399
You have to admit that.

203
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.399
I don't need you here.

That's why I'm here.

207
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.679
That's why I'm
saying any of this.

208
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.159
Look. I've said this
over and over again.

209
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.159
And I really don't
want to repeat myself.

210
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.519
Seeing as you're all here.
yes. I took something once.

211
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.960
And I mixed it with like a
substantial amount of alcohol

212
00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:54.159
and it resulted in my
not-so-finest hour.

213
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.679

214
00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:55.360

Just let me speak.

217
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.960
This whole situation
is an overreaction.

218
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:04.200
And yes. I haven't been doing as
well as I could do at college.

219
00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:08.039
But I'm working at figuring
that out and fixing it that.

220
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.519
That-- it's gotten
to be too much.

221
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.360
You're reliant on the drug.

222
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.679

I'm just asking.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.120
Does she seem like herself?

279
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.840
She hasn't seemed like
herself since she was 15.

280
00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:32.879
I just don't know.

281
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.919
There is only one
way to find out.

Hello. Abigail.

288
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.120
My name's Cara.

289
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.120
Your parents have asked
me to come and speak

290
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.840
to you about your
substance abuse

291
00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.120
habit and relative issues.

292
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.360
So this is officially
an intervention then.

293
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.159
A what?

294
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.799
That's more of an American
term. sort of thing

295
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.559
you see on a TV show.

296
00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:26.120
But I suppose what we're
doing here is not dissimilar.

297
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.679
Now. the first thing
you have to do.

298
00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:33.600
Abigail. is to admit to yourself
that you've got a problem.

299
00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:35.559
OK.

300
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:36.600
Oh. yeah.

301
00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:39.519
I do have a problem.

302
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.080
And my problem is that my
family think they know me.

303
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:45.279
They won't listen to me.

304
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.360
And others pretend
to be my friend.

305
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.000
So yeah. I think
this has actually all

306
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.600
been a big. big
waste of your time.

307
00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:57.440
So I'll just leave if I was you.

308
00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:02.240
I've seen many cases like
yours over the years. Abigail.

309
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.840
Do you find that you're
having to take more and more

310
00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:05.919
to get the same effect?

311
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.320
I'm fine.

312
00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:10.440
A break from your studies
is a good first step.

313
00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.720
Now. I suggest we take
some further steps.

314
00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:16.320
Such as?

315
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:20.200
Getting break from
routine. from familiarity.

316
00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.960
That's why so many
rehabilitation centers are out

317
00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:24.360
of the way.

318
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.679
The patient needs to
concentrate on the recovery.

319
00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.720
You're talking about me
like I'm not even here.

320
00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.759
She needs to go to rehab?

321
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.960
I find it takes better if
the whole family is involved.

322
00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:40.559
Get away from it.
concentrate on the one issue.

323
00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:41.799
Hang on.

324
00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:43.200
She's been sent
home from college

325
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:45.919
and she's getting a
free vacation out of it?

326
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.360
Mark. you're not
helping anything.

327
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.679
I don't see how a free
trip away is going to help.

328
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:50.919
Please stop.

329
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.919
Not a trip.

330
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.960
It's not a reward.

331
00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.159
It's not a punishment either.

332
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.120
You've really sold me.

333
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.919
It's a realignment.

334
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Peace and tranquility so
that Abigail and I can

335
00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.240
concentrate on her recovery.

336
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.559

in the country

337
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.839

to time. very remote.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.279
Somewhere very far
away from here.

342
00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.440
But there is room for all
the family and friend.

We're doing this for you.

357

C'mon.

358
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.160
You go first.

359
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.039
Look. I'm not doing
this out of spite.

360
00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:16.799
I'm seriously concerned for you.

361
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.039
Your parents called me
and asked me how you were.

362
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.400
But they already
knew that you were

363
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.400
struggling because the
university called them.

364
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.440
Seriously.

365
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.359
Why are you acting
like you've never

366
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.000
done drugs before in your life?

367
00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:29.680
Like you're so
fucking squeaky clean?

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:32.039

369
00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:33.079
Yeah. OK.

370
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.039
Once or twice.

371
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:35.920
But you knew that.

372
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.680
We did it together.

373
00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:37.559
Yeah.

374
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.279
But you're using
every day. constantly.

375
00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:42.079
And you owe Francis money.

376
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.240
Why did you even have to
tell them about Frank?

377
00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:47.640
You know. I'm really
starting to think

378
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.640
that you're just here for
something else. not even me.

379
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.240
really.

380
00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:54.400
OK. I'm trying to stay calm.

383
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.480
Well. it's not working. is it?

384
00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.440
You're not going to have
any friends left. Abby.

385
00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:03.640
As far as I'm concerned.
I actually don't.

386
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.359
So--

387
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.599

Abigail. why don't
we travel together?

391
00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:21.359
Your family and friend
can travel together.

392
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.359
Give us time to chat.

393
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.279
OK.

394
00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:26.880
Let's rid of two
evils. I suppose.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.279
I'm not going to post it.

401
00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:10.240
There's probably no signal.

402
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:13.079
In fact. I want
everyone's phones.

403
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160
What?

404
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.559
Now. we're here.

405
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.759
We have to focus on
Abigail and her recovery.

406
00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:22.920
I've already got her phone.

407
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.359
Now. we don't want to give
her any temptation in case

408
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.839
she tries to contact--

409
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.519

Well this is musty.

417
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.240
Need to crack a window in here.

418
00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:08.680
Shit.

419
00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:11.720

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:13.400
Hey.

421
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.720
We haven't picked those.

422
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:15.319

Huh.

427
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.559
When she went there.
the cupboard was bare.

428
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.720
I can pick up a few
things if you'd like.

429
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:47.559
We'll need to. but I wasn't
expecting you to do it.

430
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.759
I have a few calls
to make before we

431
00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:50.880
get set into the weekend.

432
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.640
And I have to obey my own rules.

433
00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.680
Hey.

434
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.799
It will work out. I promise you.

435
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.599
This is this all my fault.
Did we do something wrong?

436
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.160
Every parent asks that question.

437
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.119
What you're doing now
is the right thing.

438
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.119
We will find out why Abigail
was attracted to taking drugs

439
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.000
in the first place.

440
00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.640
It will work out.

441
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.559
Trust me.

442
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.720
But before it does.
I have to warn you.

443
00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:34.000
she will do and say
almost anything.

444
00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:38.799
There's a lot of hard
work. a lot of healing.

445
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.200
You have to be there for
her in the next few days.

446
00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:45.720
Going cold turkey will test her
to the worst of her extremes.

448
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.759
You think her
attitude is bad now?

449
00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:58.559
It's not a fraction of how
bad it is going to get.

450
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.319
But we will get
your daughter back.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.079

doesn't want to be helped?

Where is she anyway?

to be much longer.

Maybe one of us should

I would maybe give her a
few minutes to cool down.

570
00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.960
I don't need to
be kept prisoner.

571
00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.799
You're not being kept prisoner.

572
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.799
Oh. really?

573
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.440
So I can just leave then.

574
00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:28.200
No. no.

575
00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.680
You need to stay to get better.

576
00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:33.279
Look. I know it seems harsh.

577
00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:35.599
But you're my daughter
and I love you.

578
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.799
And I want to help
you through this.

579
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.640
It's got to be done.

580
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.799
Dad. seriously.

581
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.640
I'm not addicted. I swear.

582
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.880
I just let it get
really out of hand.

583
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.079
I promise you.

584
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.799
You will say anything to get
to this guy and what you need.

585
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.000
I tell you what I need.

586
00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:00.319
I need you to hear me. OK?

587
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.640
And listen to me.

588
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.519
Look. look.

589
00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:05.640
It's late.

590
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.480
It's wet.

591
00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:13.119
Let's go back to the cabin.

592
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.079
Hopefully. Cara will be
back soon with some food.

593
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.920
get something to
eat. get some sleep.

594
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.519
start again in the morning.

595
00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:20.559
No.

596
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.519
Come on. Abby.

597
00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:22.160
Stop.

598
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.559
Just stop.

599
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.160
Stop.

600
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.079
Come on. we can
do this together.

601
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:27.599
Yeah?

602
00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.319
Dad?

603
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.559
Dad.

604
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.559
Dad.

605
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.200
Dad.

606
00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:36.799
Oh. my god.

607
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.519
On my back.

608
00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:39.799
You're bleeding.

609
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.880
What's in my back?

610
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.680
You're bleeding.

611
00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:43.680
Don't move.

612
00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:44.799
It's an arrow.

613
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880
What do you mean an arrow?

614
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.519
It's a fucking arrow.

615
00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:49.880
It's an arrow.

616
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.880
Who the fuck fires
arrows at people?

617
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.720
I don't know.

618
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.359
I don't know.

619
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.720
Ah.

620
00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:55.799
Ah.

621
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.559
We have to get out of here. Dad.

622
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.640
Can you move?

623
00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.200
Can you move?

624
00:31:58.279 --> 00:31:58.759
Barely.

625
00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:01.480
Oh. my god.

626
00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:02.160
Ah. Jesus.

Oh. my god. Dad.

630
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.839
Dad. you have to move.

631
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.720
You have to move.

632
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:11.720
Get up now. please.

633
00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.920
Dad. can you move?

634
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.079
We need to get out of here now.

635
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.279
You need to fucking move.

636
00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:16.839
You need to move.

637
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.039
Can you move?

638
00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:19.680
You have to get up.

639
00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:20.559
Dad.

640
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.480
OK?

641
00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:22.400
OK.

642
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.720
Dad.

643
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:25.920
Which way back to the cabin?

644
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Which way back to the cabin?

645
00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:28.519
Which way back to the cabin?

646
00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:29.240
I don't know.

647
00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:30.680
Oh. my god.

648
00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:31.920
Just pick a direction.

649
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.759
Go. go.

650
00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:33.319
OK. this way.

651
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.160
Are you OK?

653
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.200

Hey.

658
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.680
It's OK.

659
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.960
Ah.

660
00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.240

00:32:58.799 --> 00:32:59.400
Wait.

666
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.559
Oh. my god.

667
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.039
It's a car.

668
00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.000
There's a car.

669
00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:03.920
Oh. son of a bitch.

670
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.599
Damn it.

671
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.000
Damn it.

672
00:33:05.079 --> 00:33:05.759
It's OK.

673
00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.720
We got to move.

674
00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:07.440
We got to keep moving.

675
00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:07.920
We got to go.

676
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.839
Dad.

677
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.960
I think this car is Cara.

678
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.880
That can't be good.

679
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.279
Look. I'll wait here.

680
00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:14.960
Put me down.

681
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.039
Go check the car.

682
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.119
That is the only option we have.

683
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.359
You got to keep moving. please.

684
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.160
Just keep moving.

685

Move.

686
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.680
You are so stubborn.

687
00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:21.680
It's OK.

688
00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:23.440
We will be there.

689
00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.200
Yeah.

690
00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:25.039
OK.

691
00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:26.400
You got it.

692
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.400
You got it. OK.

693
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.759
One more step.

Shit.

698
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.640
What if she took the keys?

699
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.920
Hang on.

700
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.799

this to force her to stay.

Find her. please.

Dad. no!

771
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.239
You've got to get out of here.

772
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.840
You've got to try and get away.

773

Abby.

808
00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:39.960
Abigail.

809
00:38:40.039 --> 00:38:41.960

I'm supposed to be the screw up.

873
00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:05.119
She's the golden child.

Yeah.

875
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.440
Well. that was back home.

876
00:44:09.519 --> 00:44:12.079
She had a difficult
time at university.

877
00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:16.239
She took harder to the social
scene than most people do.

878
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.199
actually.

879
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280
Where has she gone to?

880
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.519
Ah.

881
00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:24.800
I mean. this way is
where the world leads to.

882
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.960
If she wanted to
go anywhere. she

883
00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:27.599
needed to get a ride. right?

884
00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:28.280
Which way?

885
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.320
That way.

886
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.639
OK.

887
00:44:31.719 --> 00:44:32.480

Oh. I'm here.

899
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.119
Ahh!

900
00:45:29.199 --> 00:45:30.119
That sounds like--

901
00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:32.360
Shh.

902
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.320
Abby?

903
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.320
Her voice comes from
everywhere in these woods.

904
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.039
Abby.

905
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:40.480
Hey. Laura.

906
00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:41.320
Abby.

907
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.199
Wait up.

908
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:43.679
Abby.

909
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.360
[light music continues]

910
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:47.639
Abby.

911
00:45:47.719 --> 00:45:48.280
Abby?

912
00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:51.719
Ah!

913
00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:55.280

[babbling]

915
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.480
What happened?

916
00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:01.280
Abigail.

917
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.599
Abigail.

918
00:46:03.679 --> 00:46:04.960
What happened?

919
00:46:05.039 --> 00:46:05.800
Abby?

920
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.800
They're coming.

921
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.320
They're coming.

922
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.559
Shh.

923
00:46:10.639 --> 00:46:11.360
Shh.

924
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.719
What was that?

925
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.760
They're coming.

926
00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.440
Abby.

927
00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:19.039
OK.

928
00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:20.559
Let's go.

929
00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:21.760
Let's go.

Oh. my god.

934
00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:46.159
What happened?

935
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.800
She was speaking gibberish

936
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.639
the whole time.

937
00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.199
Then she went silent.

938
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.880
We haven't gotten
anything out of her since.

939
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.599
Abigail. what happened?

940
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:06.960
Did you fall?

941
00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:07.800
What about your dad?

942
00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.719
Where is he?

943
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.639
There's no sign of dad.

944
00:47:09.719 --> 00:47:10.960
What?

945
00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:12.880
She said somebody took
him and that they're

946
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.800
on the way back
here to come for us.

947
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.960
I think she's on something.

948
00:47:16.039 --> 00:47:16.800
Oh.

949
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.840
She was leaving.

950
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.960
And we found her coming back.

951
00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:20.519
Why would she be
coming back then?

952
00:47:20.599 --> 00:47:21.480
Because she scored.

953
00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:22.639
Oh. yeah.

954
00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:23.760
You think she just
happened upon a dealer

955
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.119
in the middle of the woods?

956
00:47:25.199 --> 00:47:26.960
Well. either she's on
something or her withdrawal

957
00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:28.480
symptoms are kicking in.

958
00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:30.559
Stop bickering. the pair of
you. and do something useful.

959
00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:31.519
Like what?

960
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:32.599
