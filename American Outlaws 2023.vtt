00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.530
Daddy ain't gonna
let you down. I promise.

180
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:50.864
[Dylan] You ready. Ryan?

181
00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:56.495
I gotta go.
I gotta get out of here.

182
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.205
-All right?
-Okay.

183
00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.623
Come here.

184
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:06.296
-I'll see you soon. All right?
-[Amber] Yeah.

185
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:07.589
-All right?
-[Amber] Yeah.

186
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:08.799
All right.

187
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:14.555
[Dylan] You okay?

188
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:15.556
Yeah. I'm good. bro.

189
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:16.765
I'm driving.

190
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:23.522
[old Western-style
music playing]

191
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.065
[car starts]

192
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.490
And do me a favor.
little brother.

193
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.077
What do you see out there?

194
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.289
-What do you mean?
-Out there.

195
00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.625
What's waiting for you and Amber
and that little boy?

196
00:09:44.877 --> 00:09:46.503
'Cause I'll tell you what I see.

197
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.464
Freedom.

198
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.387
I'll go anywhere
you tell me to. Dylan.

199
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.265
I'll do anything.

200
00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.184
I know. Ryan.

201
00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.270
[intense music plays]

202
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.488
[upbeat electric guitar
music playing]

203
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.176
[Dylan] Who would have thought

204
00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.886
one little scissor snip

205
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.096
could change the course
of our human events?

206
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.515
-What does that mean?
-It means

207
00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:40.974
we are now officially harboring

208
00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:42.935
a convicted felon.

209
00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.728
No turning back.

210
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:46.021
Where do you think we'll end?

211
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.607
[Dylan] Oh. Mexico. eventually.

212
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.651
But who knows. you know?

213
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.281
Guatemala. Belize. Costa Rica.

214
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.908
Hey. why don't we go
to the mountains?

215
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.701
I've always wanted to see
the mountains. You know.

216
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.036
-like Colorado or something?
-'Cause the mountains

217
00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:02.079
ain't south.

218
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.247
We gotta get south.

219
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:04.331
out of the country.

220
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.415
All we gotta do is

221
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:07.125
get across that border.

222
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.253
Hey. man. you really think
this is gonna work?

223
00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.340
I do. 'Cause it has to.

224
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:15.342
Way I figure. we'll get settled.

225
00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:17.970
build one of them makeshift
wood huts on the beach.

226
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.138
rent surfboards to tourists
for dough.

227
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.682
Hey. you'll be
watching sunsets with Amber

228
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.267
-and the baby in no time.
-Oh. fuck yeah.

229
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:24.893
I love the sound of that. bro.

230
00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:26.812
It's like one of them shitty
family road trips

231
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.480
-that we never took.
-[chuckling]

232
00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:30.649
Listen. you asked
what this means.

233
00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:34.069
It means there's no more
bullshit from our old lives.

234
00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:35.487
Fresh start.

235
00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.698
Okay? Past is past.

236
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.200
We can be whoever
we wanna be now.

237
00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:41.994
Nah. sounds too good to be true.

238
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.122
Well. it ain't. It's our
God-given inalienable right.

239
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.915
And just 'cause
it wasn't given to us.

240
00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:48.792
ain't nothing wrong with doing
a little taking now.

241
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:50.002
Damn straight.

242
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.504
-Oh! Cellphones.
-What?

243
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.673
-Hand 'em over.
-That's my phone... Yo. man!

244
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.133
-No. fuck that. No! No!
-You can't take it.

245
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.635
-You can't. Christ!
-Fucking asshole.

246
00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:00.846
Come on. There's a saying.

247
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:04.057
"Burn the old grass.
New will grow."

248
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:06.101
-Now. here are the rules.
-"Rules"?

249
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.728
-[Dylan] Rules.
-[chuckling] Okay.

250
00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.271
Well. you just said
we're revolutionists.

251
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.023
and revolutionists don't
play by the rules.

252
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.399
-[chuckles]
-God!

253
00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:14.526
[Dylan] Don't be a smartass.

254
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.945
Rule number one.
always stick near the car.

255
00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.948
You got to get food. grab a
smoke. take a shit. whatever.

256
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.659
you gotta tell me.
no ifs. ands. or buts.

257
00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:24.077
Rule number two.

258
00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:25.621
What I say. day or night. goes.

259
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.289
It can't be questioned.

260
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.082
Well. this is getting better
by the second.

261
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.168
There's always got to be
one person steering the ship.

262
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.962
and if shit hits the fan.
you gotta do exactly as I say.

263
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.215
Without question.
Full commitment.

264
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.717
-All right.
-Speaking of which...

265
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.930
-Shit. man. What's that for?
-Insurance.

266
00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:44.181
What? You think we'll need that?

267
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.599
Well. if we do. I'd rather be

268
00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:46.767
answering that question

269
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.602
with it than without it.

270
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.062
Finally...

271
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.481
-And this is for you. Ryan.
-Yeah?

272
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.108
-Don't fuckin' speed!
-[all chuckling]

273
00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:57.194
We don't need no unnecessary
attention. got it?

274
00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.488
-Well. duh. Dylan.
-I'm dead serious. bro.

275
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.782
You say you got it. you keep
that left foot of yours in check

276
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.700
or I'll shove it
up your ass myself.

277
00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:06.328
Hey. look. chill out.
You got nothing to worry about.

278
00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:07.704
Okay?

279
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:15.587

[dispatch speaking indistinctly]

282
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:21.760
[Dylan] Damn it!
What did I just tell you?

283
00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.220
Slow the fuck down!

284
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.138
-[Ryan] Hang on. guys.

[engine revving]

286
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.518
I can't believe it! We're
not even out of the state

287
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.103
and we're already
going down in flames.

288
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.771
We ain't going down nothing.
Ryan's got this.

289
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.190
You got this.
Just keep calm. Let's go!

-[tires screeching]

[Grace yelps]

292
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:43.782
The way I figure.
we got 20 seconds

293
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.409
before the rest of
the police force is on us.

294
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.077
You gotta give us some distance.
We're doing fine.

295
00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:48.954
I got my foot through the
fucking floor. man.

296
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.497
What now?

297
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.333
Dylan!

298
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:55.586
All right. screw this.

299
00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:59.506
-Shit's gotta stop.
-What are we. killing cops now?

300
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:02.426
-Are we killing cops. Dylan?
-We ain't killing nobody.

301
00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:05.512
-[Ryan] Holy shit.
-[Grace] What the fuck?

302
00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:07.181
Just slowing them down.

303
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.601
-[siren blaring]
-[gunshot]

304
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.269
Whoa! Hey. fuck! Damn it. Ryan!

305
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.937
You keep this bitch steady!

306
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.023
[officer] Shots were
fired from. ah...

307
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.152
[gunshots]

308
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.945
[tires screech]

309
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:23.780
[officer on radio]
We got a flat tire.

310
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.834
[Dylan] Mm-hmm.

311
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.004
Ain't nothing to stop us
damn Doughertys.

312
00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:40.964
We move fucking mountains
if we have to.

313
00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:42.799
Man. I would have loved to see
that cop's face

314
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.468
when the bullet
whizzed past his ear.

315
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.094
[Ryan] Yeah. man.
but that shit was close.

316
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:47.596
Couple of inches over.
and we would've been

317
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.389
marked for
the electric chair. Right?

318
00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:50.641
Right?

319
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:53.644
Fuck me!

320
00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.020
What?

321
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.440
What?

322
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.027
We're just shooting
a hornet's nest.

323
00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:04.780
What do you mean?
We got away. no one got hurt.

324
00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.240
Must be fooling ourselves
if we think

325
00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.075
they're gonna paint it
that way for us.

326
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.369
Oh. shit.

327
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.412
Shit.

328
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.540
Shit! Shit! Shit! Dylan's right.

329
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.667
We're in Florida. They're gonna
have us strung up by our balls

330
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.126
saying we're attempted
cop-killers.

331
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.586
Just stop it. Ryan.

332
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:21.296
Okay? We're in this together.

333
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:22.422
If something happens
to one of us.

334
00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:23.507
it happens to all of us.

335
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.175
Right. Dylan?

336
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.178
Dylan?

337
00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:29.429
Hey. pull over.

338
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:30.764
What?

339
00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:33.058
Hey. hey. hey. Just pull over.

340
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:35.602
[breathing heavily] Fuck.

341
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:39.064
[ominous music playing]

342
00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.414
[Grace] What are you doing?

343
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.124
[Dylan] Hey. pop the trunk.

344
00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:02.421
See...

345
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.631
Somewhere along the way...

346
00:16:05.883 --> 00:16:09.428
humanity just...

347
00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.890
got stuck at the wrong groove
of the record player.

348
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.142
Spinning round and round.

349
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.729
And while you can't change
the motion on the table.

350
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.856
you sure shit
can change the song.

351
00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.693
W... What's this?

352
00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:26.570
Brought this in case
we needed to sell 'em.

353
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.655
but now it seems we're punching
a different ticket.

354
00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:31.450
You see. our whole lives.
we've been the little guy.

355
00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:35.412
Getting stepped on.
stepped over.

356
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:37.789
I mean. who are we fooling?
What do we got between us

357
00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.291
to get us where we need to go?

358
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.375
Huh?

359
00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:41.835
Huh. how much. Ryan?

360
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:44.129
Ah. I'm probably six. maybe 700.

361
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:45.506
There you go. and on that.
we'd be lucky

362
00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:46.548
to make the Amarillo.

363
00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:47.925
let alone Mexico.

364
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.551
So. what are you suggesting?

365
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.429
I'm suggesting
we finally take something...

366
00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:54.056
we never had.

367
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:56.892
Oh. yeah? And what's that?

shot at a police car in Florida.

372

[reporter]A police officer was attempting

373
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.739
to stop this white four-door
sedan for speeding

374
00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:13.534
when he was led
on a high-speed chase.

375

the Doughertys opened fire.

-[cop] Holy shit!

Maybe use the word "ambush."
But they were trying

378
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.918
to hurt this officer.
if not kill him.

379
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.294

the three Doughertys'

380

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.518
Like. when we was kids.

386
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.520
[Ryan] I don't know. bro.
You really think it will work?

387
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.397
[Grace] Yeah.
How do you know three minutes?

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.107
[Dylan] It's like every movie.

389

We go in balls-out.

and the rest will fall
right in line.

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:54.449
Look. three minutes

394
00:17:54.658 --> 00:17:56.368

Joanne. you tell Connie.
she's outdone herself.

Oh. you boys want
Joanne here to get your tea.

401
00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.060
Can we get started?

402
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.854
We're pressed for time
and we have to get on the road.

403
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.315
I told y'all what I know.

404
00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.318
Boy ain't nothing special.
He's just another number.

405
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.528
Yeah. well. we believe that
this kid and his siblings

406
00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:33.488
attempted to murder
a police officer.

407
00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.699
Well. that seems
jurisdictional to me.

408
00:18:35.908 --> 00:18:37.618
[Agent Donovan] Meaning?

409
00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.121
Meaning we can just
cut through the bullshit.

410
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.416
Now. why would federal agents

411
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.044
be sitting here
with little old Flo and I

412
00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.755
not enjoying
a damn good pizza pie?

413
00:18:51.048 --> 00:18:53.675
We ran sheets on Ryan's sister
and older brother.

414
00:18:54.927 --> 00:18:57.387
And the sister has a record
as long as my arm. but...

415
00:18:57.596 --> 00:18:59.973
But it's
the older brother. Dylan.

416
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:01.475
The guy that he lays
asphalt with

417
00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:02.893
says that he's got
a thing for guns.

418
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.728
And that he has a lot of 'em.

419
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:07.356
So. we just... you know.
we wanna lock this down.

420
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.107
You know. before things
get out of hand.

Yeah. yeah. Look.

I've been in this business

My job.

427
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.416
and only job. is to keep tabs.

428
00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:28.335
Make sure they're staying
where they're supposed to.

429
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.713
How's that working out for you?

430
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.384
You got a point
you getting at. Agent?

431
00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.135
'Cause right now.

432
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.304
I see we're all putting
our dicks on the table.

433
00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:40.806
but nobody's fucking.

434
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.350
Elegantly put.

435
00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:46.270
Why did Ryan run?

436
00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.146
Don't know.

437
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.690
You got to ask him.

438
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.817
His girlfriend. Amber Suriano.

439
00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.861
said you threatened
to violate his parole.

440
00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:57.072
and presented him
with a no-end situation.

441
00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:59.116
-And he was desperate.
-No shit.

442
00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.201
Man. we're all desperate.

443
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.079
I see these idiot kids
go through the system every day

00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:05.747
one after the other.

445
00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.541
Nothing ever changes.

446
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.169
Nothing in life
ever really changes.

447
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.379
What you see is what you get.

448
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.464
Bullshit.

449
00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.675
Except this pie. of course.

450
00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:19.761
Some days. it just happen
to be better than nothing.

451
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.889
[sighs] Appreciate your time.

452
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.307
We'll be in touch.

[Willy] Hope you
find 'em. Agents.

454
00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:28.854
You know.

455
00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.898

-I don't know.
-No. no. no.

459
00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:59.051
It's this generation.
They're just different.

460
00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.928
You know. it used to be
that we were busting

461
00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.346
drug dealers from Mexico

462
00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:05.474
or biker gangs from Canada.

I can't even pronounce.

464
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.690
Then one morning
we woke up and. ah...

465
00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:15.150
problem wasn't
out there anymore.

466
00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:16.860
It's right here.

467
00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:19.071
Right in our own
goddamn backyard.

468
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.990
They're hardened criminals.

469
00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:25.911
-They're kids.
-Yeah?

470
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.788
But lately. kids have been
walking into schools

471
00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:29.831
and movie theaters
and blowing away other kids.

472

-What's your point?
-My point. Agent.

473
00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.211
is I don't care

474
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.047
what kind of upbringing
they had or didn't have.

475
00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:39.675
or what kind of psychological
justification bullshit

476
00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.343
you want to throw out there.

477
00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:43.387
I want this halted at all costs

478
00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.264
before it escalates.
You got that?

479
00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.724
Sounds like the option of
dead or alive is off the table.

Come on. let's go. Start.

529

And she's not gonna put

530
00:23:48.804 --> 00:23:50.639
one of those exploding ink
devices in there.

531
00:23:50.848 --> 00:23:52.891
'cause that will make
Santa angry.

532
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.769
And nobody is gonna like Santa
when he's angry.

533
00:23:55.978 --> 00:23:57.354
Hey! Let's go.

534

Lastly. all of y'all.

from nobody. right?

544
00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:21.587
Right? Great.

545

think about getting up.

Whoa. whoa! All right.
Listen up. Listen up.

First of all. we ain't rich.

601
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.209
Only reason why we're here is
'cause we've been thinking smart

602
00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:06.835
and getting a new car is smart.

Don't be a stick in the mud.

I mean. listen. Dylan.
you've been going on and on

about the system's slanted

in everyone else's
favor but ours.

607
00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.511
This is our due and the
world's giving us a break

608
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.137
and you're not gonna take it?
That's bullshit.

609
00:27:17.346 --> 00:27:18.889
Yeah. I think she's right. bro.

610
00:27:19.097 --> 00:27:20.432
We earned this.
I think you earned this.

611
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.184
What did we earn. exactly? Huh?

612
00:27:22.392 --> 00:27:23.769
-Well...
-An upgrade.

613
00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:25.729
All right. But listen.
nothing too fancy.

Just be quick. all right?
Go on. be quick.

00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:32.694
Oh. shit! No.

617
00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:38.825
No.

618
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:46.750
Look at this.

going for 7.000.

620
00:27:54.007 --> 00:27:56.510
Here we go. American-made.

621
00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:11.608
Fuck yeah.

622
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:20.158
[chuckling] It's automatic. Yo!

623
00:28:21.577 --> 00:28:23.036
Yo. it's got a car seat.

624
00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:24.705
[Dylan] Oh. yeah.

A cup holder.
Groceries in the back.

627
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:33.505
We can do this.

Put the baby in and... close.

00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.776
Hey. can I get a salesman
over here?

632
00:29:13.629 --> 00:29:15.547
[Bobby] Mm. wow.

633
00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:22.429
Don't you think something
a little hot would fit better?

634
00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:25.599
Excuse me?

635
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:28.894
Well. I mean. my philosophy is

636
00:29:29.102 --> 00:29:31.522
the car should match the person.

637
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:33.690
No.

638
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.026
Is that right?

639
00:29:37.653 --> 00:29:38.695
Yeah.

640
00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:41.615
Now. this one.

641
00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:44.618

a statement. right?

Take a seat.

2008. low-mileage V8.

646
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:10.102
There's a lot going on
under this hood

647
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.436
if you know what I mean.

648
00:30:15.482 --> 00:30:17.150
-Is that right?
-[Bobby] Yeah.

649
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:18.694
It's definitely right.

650
00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:20.904
Well. Bobby Junior...

651
00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:23.156
I like it.

652
00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:26.702
But normally I go for something
that would get me

653
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.245
in a little more trouble.

654
00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.250
You know where a girl
can find some around here?

655
00:30:36.211 --> 00:30:37.171
Mmm.

656
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:40.465

-[Bobby] I guess.
-[Grace] Oh. college boy.

are from work.

-Bunch of assholes.

It feels like we won the lottery
or something. bro.

670
00:31:22.341 --> 00:31:25.010
Feels damn good is what it does.

671

-[both panting]
-[Grace] Yeah.

672
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:31.475
Now. I'd like to find
a real nice guy...

673
00:31:31.683 --> 00:31:35.187
or like a wholesome
small-town guy or something.

674
00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:36.647
-You know what I mean?
-Mmm-hmm.

675
00:31:36.855 --> 00:31:38.190
-[moans]
-[Grace] He'd go to work

676
00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:40.234
and I'd stay at home
with the kids

677
00:31:40.442 --> 00:31:41.985
and. I don't know...

678
00:31:42.194 --> 00:31:44.363
fucking wash-up or something.

679
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:45.656
You know. normal shit.

680
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.660
-And you?
-[moaning. panting]

681
00:31:49.868 --> 00:31:51.328
Does that interest you?

682
00:31:51.537 --> 00:31:53.121
What do you mean? [moans]

683
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.541
You know. it's just. like.
finding the real thing

684
00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:58.377
and insulating yourself and...

685
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:02.047
finding what really matters
and just being.

686
00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:04.842
You know? Would you like that?

687
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.802
What? I don't understand.

688
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.345

689
00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:09.888
Well. how do you
not understand. sugar?

690
00:32:10.097 --> 00:32:11.890
What do you think
I'm talking about?

691
00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:13.559
Fuck. I don't know.

692
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:14.893
But all this talk
is making my dick go limp.

693
00:32:15.102 --> 00:32:16.687
-so can we just--
-[both grunting]

694
00:32:18.939 --> 00:32:21.191
-You ain't no different.
-What?

695
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.318
What-- what did I say?

696
00:32:23.527 --> 00:32:24.611
God damn it!

697
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.655
What the fuck is wrong with you?

698
00:32:26.864 --> 00:32:28.907
Fuckin' bleeding heart. I should
just cut the fuckin' thing out.

699
00:32:29.116 --> 00:32:30.450
Always confuses
the hell out of me.

700
00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:32.202
Are you're fucking crazy
or something?

701
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:34.288
Yeah. I'm fucking crazy.

-Hey. Whoa. whoa. whoa.

703
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.791
That's not the deal.
We had a deal.

704
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.627

-Fuck.

Hey. you know the good news is
that. you know. the HR5

708
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.053
has the speed you've
been looking for.

709
00:32:50.262 --> 00:32:51.680
And it has the backseat space

710
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:53.223
for that little one
you got there.

711
00:32:53.432 --> 00:32:55.809
Son. I'm. I'm having
a son. man. So...

712
00:32:56.018 --> 00:32:58.562
-Okay. okay.
-We need space for a car seat.

713
00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.023
You know. like a good.
sturdy car seat. yeah.

714
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:03.108
-[Bobby] Stay down. bitch!

[Bobby groaning]

721
00:33:20.626 --> 00:33:23.420
All we need to do then is just
let you look over the paperwork

722
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:25.047
and sign right here
on the dotted line.

723
00:33:25.255 --> 00:33:26.131
and we'd be in business.

[chuckles]

725
00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:30.469

to be paying for this?

-Cash.
-Cash money.

Hey. slow down!
Wait. Where are you going?

-Anywhere but here.

is going on. Lee-Grace?

735

God damn it. Lee-Grace.
What the hell is going on?

736
00:33:57.746 --> 00:33:59.414
-What did you do?
-I didn't do nothing.

737
00:33:59.623 --> 00:34:01.166
[Dylan] Oh. we should have
never gone in there

738

739
00:34:03.168 --> 00:34:05.337
What the hell happened?
What did you do?

740
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.924
I said I didn't do nothing.

741
00:34:10.926 --> 00:34:11.969
[Dylan] You okay?

742
00:34:14.847 --> 00:34:16.473
[sniffling] Goddamn right
I'm okay. Dylan.

I'm always okay.

744
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:22.145
Can we go?

745
00:34:24.022 --> 00:34:25.440
Can we please just go?

We ain't good
till we cross that border.

All right. let's giddy
the fuck up. Which way?

Keep going through the south.

to go is a good atlas."

762

This here will take us
straight to the promised land.

Back roads only. state highways.

764
00:35:55.113 --> 00:35:57.282
-No interstates.
-Well. how's that?

765
00:35:57.491 --> 00:35:59.618
[Dylan] Only reason why cops
hang out in the interstates

766
00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:01.620
is they're like giant
ATM machines.

767

Ain't no money
on the back roads.

768

No money. no thieving cops.

00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:08.669
That all right with you. LG?

770
00:36:09.837 --> 00:36:11.588
Sure. Right as rain.

intended it to be.

It's like a real-life

[victim] I'll tell you this.

778

They all had a wild look
in their eyes.

779
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.205
Psychopathic killers for sure.

780
00:36:45.414 --> 00:36:47.541
I thought you said
you couldn't see their eyes.

781
00:36:47.749 --> 00:36:48.917
Because of their masks.

782
00:36:50.627 --> 00:36:52.087
Well. if I could have
seen their eyes.

783
00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:54.047
they would have been wild.

I'm sure of it.

785
00:36:57.718 --> 00:37:00.095

quite pleasant.

786
00:37:00.304 --> 00:37:01.722
I mean.

787
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:05.142
one of the young men
offered me a chair.

788
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.519

the siblings may be heading west

in an attempt
to leave the country.

791
00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:21.200
And we'll be utilizing
all federal and local resources

792
00:37:21.408 --> 00:37:23.368
to prevent that from happening.

793
00:37:23.577 --> 00:37:25.120
Make no mistake.

794
00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:27.873
the Dougherty gang are armed
and dangerous.

795
00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:30.751
And if you engage with them.
you will be going into battle.

796
00:37:32.044 --> 00:37:33.670
I'll now turn things
over to Agent Morely

797

you might have.

805

and used AK-47s

to fire into the ceiling.
but no one was hurt.

807
00:38:01.615 --> 00:38:03.659
Just think that people are
really bold to come out

808
00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:05.827
and do such a thing
in broad daylight.

00:41:08.552 --> 00:41:09.761
We're on fucking CNN.
bro. We gotta go.

877
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.221
[Grace] CNN?
What are we. famous?

878
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.723
Where the fuck
are the keys. Dylan?

879
00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:14.308
In the ignition.
Here we go. Let's go!

880
00:41:14.516 --> 00:41:15.559
Put it in drive and get us out.

881
00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:17.352
[Grace] Go. Ryan! Go. go!

882
00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:25.861
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[Dylan] Keep it slow.

883
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.363
Only way we're getting out
of here. we just roll on

884
00:41:28.572 --> 00:41:29.823
like nothing's wrong. all right?

885
00:41:30.032 --> 00:41:31.742
Slow and calm.
Just slow and calm.

886
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.077
[Ryan] Right. Slow and calm.

887
00:41:34.286 --> 00:41:36.580
[on radio] Dylan and Lee-Grace
Dougherty again fired

888
00:41:36.788 --> 00:41:38.665
-their high-powered guns...
-Fuck.

889
00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:40.459
...as they robbed a bank
in Valdosta. Georgia.

890
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.336
Now. with that just-released
dash-cam video.

891
00:41:42.544 --> 00:41:44.171
-the sheriff says that...
-[Ryan] Oh. shit.

892
00:41:44.379 --> 00:41:45.589
[on radio] ...car several times.

893
00:41:45.797 --> 00:41:47.549
attempting to get a clear shot.

894
00:41:47.758 --> 00:41:48.675
As the officers called...

895
00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:50.260
[Ryan] Are we fucked?

896
00:41:50.469 --> 00:41:52.137
Yo. we're fucked. right?

897
00:41:52.346 --> 00:41:54.056
[officer] They were trying
to hurt this officer

898
00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:55.974
if not kill him.

899
00:41:56.183 --> 00:41:59.478
-[somber music playing]
-[radio continues indistinctly]

900
00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:02.397
[Grace] You think
they'll turn us in?

901
00:42:02.606 --> 00:42:04.691
[Dylan] No. these people
ain't gonna turn us in.

902
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.276
[radio] ...as to where
the siblings are right now.

903
00:42:06.485 --> 00:42:07.611
[Dylan] They're us.

904
00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:08.737
[on radio] They put them.

905
00:42:08.946 --> 00:42:10.030
some in North Georgia.

906
00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:11.281
some in Tennessee.

907
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.158
around or in Chattanooga.

908
00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:15.202
Coming up tonight at six.
we're gonna play for you

909
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.871
an interview we have
with the mother...

910
00:42:19.706 --> 00:42:21.583
[Grace] Where the hell are we?

911
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:23.544
Feels like we are in
a different country.

912
00:42:26.713 --> 00:42:29.383
[Dylan] Alabama. I think.

913
00:42:34.054 --> 00:42:36.640
[somber music playing]

914
00:43:05.127 --> 00:43:06.628
[dog barking]

915
00:43:25.355 --> 00:43:29.443
And she basically
threw herself at me.

916
00:43:29.651 --> 00:43:31.987
Ah. lured me in
all provocative-like.

917
00:43:33.405 --> 00:43:36.617
What kind of girl just spreads
her legs open to some stranger?

918
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.912
Fucking slut.

919
00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:44.416
My shit's probably gonna stop
burning any second now. man.

920
00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:45.876
[sighs]

921
00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:50.339
[Morely] Did she
mention anything?

922
00:43:52.174 --> 00:43:54.176
Hmm? Happen to say
where she was going?

923
00:43:55.636 --> 00:43:57.387
To hell for all I care.

924
00:43:58.096 --> 00:43:59.264
Crazy bitch.

925
00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:01.183
Man. she's a straight
psychopath.

926
00:44:01.391 --> 00:44:02.518
I'll tell you that much.

927
00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:04.686
She needs to be locked up.

928
00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:11.527
If you find her.
I hope you shoot her.

929
00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:13.445
I hope you shoot her
right in the fucking face.

930
00:44:13.654 --> 00:44:15.155
I mean. look at me.

931
00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:17.032
Look what she did to my face.

932
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:18.825
[strained breath]

933
00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:20.035
All right.

934
00:44:21.161 --> 00:44:22.913
If you happen to think
of anything else.

935
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:24.164
you let us know.

936
00:44:25.624 --> 00:44:26.875
Uh...

937
00:44:28.085 --> 00:44:29.503
I'm not looking for any trouble.

938
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:31.588
I'm going to school
at the end of the month.

939
00:44:31.797 --> 00:44:33.298
I got a future to think about.

940
00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:35.968
That's funny. 'Cause we
found a box full of drugs

941
00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:37.636
that might dictate differently.

942
00:44:40.931 --> 00:44:41.932
So...

943
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.727
why don't you think
long and hard?

944
00:44:45.936 --> 00:44:47.646
You know.

945
00:44:47.855 --> 00:44:49.815
Make sure you've
shared everything.

946
00:44:50.023 --> 00:44:52.734
And we'll make sure to let you
know about that future of yours.

947
00:44:52.943 --> 00:44:54.069
Okay?

948
00:44:56.655 --> 00:44:57.781
You get well soon.

949
00:45:02.202 --> 00:45:04.496
Prick kid. sitting in there.

950
00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:07.583
Ladies and gentlemen.
the future of America.

951
00:45:08.876 --> 00:45:09.918
You got kids?

952
00:45:10.961 --> 00:45:12.421
No. man.

953
00:45:12.629 --> 00:45:14.131
The missus and I
have been trying.

954
00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:15.465
but it's been hard.

955
00:45:15.674 --> 00:45:17.634
Yeah? Well. I got two boys.

956
00:45:17.843 --> 00:45:20.846
Their whole lives are rap music
and online knockout videos.

957
00:45:21.054 --> 00:45:22.598
and that's when
they're not sucking up

958
00:45:22.806 --> 00:45:24.558
to their asshole dentist stepdad

959
00:45:24.766 --> 00:45:27.311
for the next Xbox game
that I can't afford to get 'em.

960
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:29.771
You know. I'd say that
they need to get

961
00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.940
their priorities straight.
but...

962
00:45:32.149 --> 00:45:34.568
I'm beginning to think
there is no priority.

963
00:45:34.776 --> 00:45:35.777
It's a new world. Agent.

964
00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:37.237
All we can do is

965
00:45:37.446 --> 00:45:39.489
keep trying to bring
some order to it.

966
00:45:39.698 --> 00:45:41.450
Kind of like punching water.
You know what I mean?

967
00:45:41.658 --> 00:45:42.910
[Morely chuckles softly]

968
00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:45.621
-[Morely] We were cold.
-[Donovan] What do you mean?

969
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:47.748
[Morely] I mean.
that was our last lead.

970
00:45:47.956 --> 00:45:49.124
We have a few
unconfirmed reports

971
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:50.751
of the vehicle out in Texas.

972
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.170
But as of right now.
we're still in the dark.

973
00:45:53.378 --> 00:45:54.546
So we wait.

974
00:45:56.507 --> 00:45:57.799
Why wait?

975
00:45:58.008 --> 00:45:59.510
Oh. they'll get
tired of running.

976
00:45:59.718 --> 00:46:01.261
make a mistake.

977
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.429
Eventually. we'll get 'em.

978
00:46:02.638 --> 00:46:03.805
We always do.

979
00:46:05.724 --> 00:46:08.352
It's like punching water. Agent.
Like punching water.

980
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.561
Yeah.

981
00:46:14.483 --> 00:46:15.859
[Ryan] Is it me
or is everything starting

982
00:46:16.068 --> 00:46:17.861
to look the same around here?

983
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:20.489
Well. if by "the same" you mean
"boring as shit." then yeah.

984
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.659
Where are we. anyway?

985
00:46:23.867 --> 00:46:25.619
[Dylan] Texarkana.

986
00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:27.663
Don't you think
that's a stupid name?

987
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:31.124
Like a lazy name?
It's like...

988
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:33.710
"Our town is on the border
of Arkansas and Texas

989
00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:36.463
and we ain't creative enough
to come up with a name.

990
00:46:36.672 --> 00:46:39.758
so we'll just call it
Texarkana." Dumb fucks.

991
00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:42.469
You know. the boredom's getting
to your brain cells.

992
00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:44.930
Dylan. what are you doing
down there?

993
00:46:46.014 --> 00:46:48.183
[Dylan] Working on switching
these. [coughs]

994
00:46:48.392 --> 00:46:51.478
We gotta do everything we can
to keep them off our tail.

995
00:46:51.687 --> 00:46:54.064
-Who's "them"?
-The good guys.

996
00:46:54.273 --> 00:46:56.275
I thought we were the good guys.

997
00:46:56.483 --> 00:46:57.818
Jesus. Lee-Grace.

998
00:46:59.027 --> 00:47:01.405
We're the ones wearing masks
and taking the bank's money.

999
00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:02.948
or hadn't you noticed?

1000
00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:04.700
You know what. Ryan?
That's your story.

1001
00:47:04.908 --> 00:47:06.118
I've got a different view.

1002
00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:07.953
[Ryan] Oh. yeah? And how's that?

1003
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:09.997
Well. we're like crusaders.

1004
00:47:10.205 --> 00:47:12.040
Steal from the rich
and give it to the poor.

1005
00:47:12.249 --> 00:47:15.169
[chuckling] What poor
are we giving to?

1006
00:47:15.377 --> 00:47:17.254
Well. we're poor.

1007
00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:18.755
You know. we're giving it
to ourselves.

1008
00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:20.257
We're standing for
something here.

1009
00:47:20.465 --> 00:47:22.092
Something big.

1010
00:47:22.301 --> 00:47:23.510
Who knows. they might even
write stories and songs

1011
00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:25.429
about us someday.

1012
00:47:25.637 --> 00:47:27.639
Girl. the only song
they're writing about you

1013
00:47:27.848 --> 00:47:30.309
is one of those sad. sad
twangy country songs

1014
00:47:30.517 --> 00:47:32.227
about a girl
who don't know shit.

1015
00:47:32.436 --> 00:47:33.687
[Dylan] Actually.
you're both right.

1016
00:47:33.896 --> 00:47:35.230
[clears throat] And wrong.

1017
00:47:35.439 --> 00:47:37.441
There's good guys
and there's bad guys.

1018
00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:41.236
just depends on who's telling
the story at that moment.

1019
00:47:41.445 --> 00:47:42.821
It's all about perspective.

1020
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.615
-[coughs]
-What are we. then?

1021
00:47:44.823 --> 00:47:46.408
Well. seeing as
our story ain't over.

1022
00:47:46.617 --> 00:47:47.951
that remains to be
figured out.

1023
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.662
-[coughs]
-You all right?

1024
00:47:50.871 --> 00:47:53.415
Yeah. I'm just. I'm...
just tired. is all.

1025
00:47:53.624 --> 00:47:56.210
Man. the only thing I got
is a dry-ass mouth

1026
00:47:56.418 --> 00:47:57.794
'cause we're out of water.

1027
00:47:58.003 --> 00:47:59.421
When are we gonna
get some more supplies?

1028
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.757
-I'm starving.
-[Dylan] Can't.

1029
00:48:01.965 --> 00:48:03.550
You saw what happened
at the gas pump.

1030
00:48:03.759 --> 00:48:05.219
Look. money we got sets us up
for a little bit.

1031
00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:07.221
but we gotta be thinking
long-term.

1032
00:48:07.429 --> 00:48:08.680
We gotta find an angle.

1033
00:48:08.889 --> 00:48:10.057
Someone unsuspected.

1034
00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.142
[coughs] Take what we need.

1035
00:48:12.351 --> 00:48:13.894
What. by force?

1036
00:48:14.102 --> 00:48:15.479
[Dylan] If need be.

1037
00:48:20.442 --> 00:48:21.735
Well. look alive. guys.

1038
00:48:23.529 --> 00:48:24.988
I don't know what this is.

1039
00:48:39.753 --> 00:48:42.464
-[Harold] Howdy.
-[Dylan] Ah... howdy.

1040
00:48:42.673 --> 00:48:44.758
-[Harold] Car trouble?
-Oh. no. Just a loose plate.

1041
00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:46.260
Afraid it was gonna come off.

1042
00:48:46.468 --> 00:48:47.845
Y'all from around here?

1043
00:48:48.053 --> 00:48:49.263
Nope. We're just. ah...
[coughs]

1044
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:50.556
Just passing through.

1045
00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:51.974
[Grace] We're on
family vacation.

1046
00:48:52.182 --> 00:48:53.851
[couple] Oh.

1047
00:48:54.059 --> 00:48:55.853
-Well...?
-It's up to you.

1048
00:48:56.061 --> 00:48:57.479
Okay.

1049
00:48:57.688 --> 00:48:59.731
Y'all look hungry to me.

1050
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.109
Our place is just
right up the road.

1051
00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:04.027
Love to give you a good meal.

1052
00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:06.321
Some nice iced tea.
Would that suit you?

1053
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.991
Ah... Yeah. that sounds great.
Doesn't it?

1054
00:49:09.199 --> 00:49:10.784
Yeah. Yes. please.

1055
00:49:10.993 --> 00:49:13.579
-Great. Just follow us on up.
-Yes. ma'am.

1056
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:18.709
[tense music playing]

1057
00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:29.887
[Grace] Dylan. what is this?
What are we doing?

1058
00:49:30.095 --> 00:49:31.889
[Dylan] Opportunity
just knocked.

1059
00:49:32.097 --> 00:49:33.265
[coughs]

1060
00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:39.605
[tense music continues playing]

1061
00:49:39.813 --> 00:49:41.732
[Grace] So. it was the three
of us siblings. Mama and Daddy.

1062
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.025
but Daddy died.

1063
00:49:43.233 --> 00:49:44.776
[Loretta] I am so sorry.

1064
00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:46.904
Yeah. I mean. they said
it was natural causes.

1065
00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:48.322
heart or something. but...

1066
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.865
I think life just wore him down.

1067
00:49:50.073 --> 00:49:51.533
Yeah. and barely
the early side of 40.

1068
00:49:51.742 --> 00:49:53.452
Nothing natural about that.

1069
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.329
God bless you and your family.

1070
00:49:55.537 --> 00:49:56.830
Oh. thank you.

1071
00:49:57.039 --> 00:49:58.916
God bless you too. ma'am.
[chuckles]

1072
00:49:59.124 --> 00:50:00.918
You got neighbors nearby?

1073
00:50:01.126 --> 00:50:03.128
Nah. we like the space.

1074
00:50:03.337 --> 00:50:05.255
It's the way most people
prefer it around here.

1075
00:50:05.464 --> 00:50:06.256
Farm?

1076
00:50:06.465 --> 00:50:07.382
A few head of cattle

1077
00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:09.426
over the hill there.

1078
00:50:09.635 --> 00:50:10.677
Just enough to keep
the lights on.

1079
00:50:10.886 --> 00:50:12.012
[all chuckling]

1080
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:13.722
Harold's retired from the Navy.

1081
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:15.349
His pension did
very well for us.

1082
00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:17.434
Oh. well. we're from Florida

1083
00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:19.102
road-tripping south.

1084
00:50:19.311 --> 00:50:20.646
I prefer the mountains
'cause I always wanted

1085
00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:23.106
to see Colorado.
but we gotta go south.

1086
00:50:23.315 --> 00:50:24.650
Ah... where was I? Oh. yeah.

1087
00:50:24.858 --> 00:50:26.777
When Daddy passed.
tore us apart.

1088
00:50:26.985 --> 00:50:28.529
emotionally and literally.

1089
00:50:28.737 --> 00:50:30.489
Wasn't many years later
Dylan here was sent away.

1090
00:50:30.697 --> 00:50:32.115
-Lee-Grace!
-"Sent away"?

1091
00:50:32.324 --> 00:50:34.660
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
What was he. like. 14. 15?

1092
00:50:34.868 --> 00:50:37.246
Uh. 16. I was 11.

1093
00:50:37.454 --> 00:50:38.580
You were 16. I remember.

1094
00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:40.499
[Grace] It wasn't
his fault though.

1095
00:50:40.707 --> 00:50:43.252
He was acting out and Mama
thought it would be best

1096
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.546
if he were raised by our aunt
up in Kentucky.

1097
00:50:45.754 --> 00:50:48.131
So. he left and things were
different from then on.

1098
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.509
And then there was the bastard.

1099
00:50:50.717 --> 00:50:52.553
Excuse me.
Did you say the "bastard"?

1100
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:53.637
[Dylan] LG!

1101
00:50:53.846 --> 00:50:54.721
[Grace] Yeah. he was just

1102
00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.598
this man in our lives.

1103
00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.519
And boy. let me tell you.
he was a bastard.

1104
00:51:00.727 --> 00:51:02.312
-I can't even begin--
-[Dylan] Lee-Grace. enough!

1105
00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:04.273
-[Ryan] Yo!
-Simmer down. Dylan.

1106
00:51:04.481 --> 00:51:05.941
We're just catching up
with these nice people.

1107
00:51:06.149 --> 00:51:07.401
-Calm the hell down.
-Yeah? Well. it ain't

1108
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:09.570
none of their damn business.

1109
00:51:09.778 --> 00:51:11.029
[coughs]

1110
00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:13.198
-[Loretta] Ah...
-I'm sorry.

1111
00:51:13.407 --> 00:51:14.575
He just gets in these moods.

1112
00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:17.286
Ah... pie!

1113
00:51:17.494 --> 00:51:18.704
How about some pie?

1114
00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:20.372
I think everyone
would like that.

1115
00:51:20.581 --> 00:51:23.000
Oh. thank you.
Oh. that would be great.

1116
00:51:23.208 --> 00:51:25.878
She makes really good pie.
You're gonna enjoy it.

1117
00:51:26.086 --> 00:51:27.671
[Grace] Oh.
that would be so nice.

1118
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.758
[on radio] We now interrupt
our current program

1119
00:51:31.967 --> 00:51:33.427
with some breaking news.

1120
00:51:33.635 --> 00:51:35.137
The three
central Florida siblings.

1121
00:51:35.345 --> 00:51:37.681
two brothers. 21 and 26.
and sister. 24.

1122
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.349
are wanted for serious crimes

1123
00:51:39.558 --> 00:51:40.642
including shooting
at an officer.

1124
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.644
assault. and bank robbery.

1125
00:51:42.853 --> 00:51:45.898
FBI special task force agent
Robert Donovan had this to say.

1126
00:51:46.106 --> 00:51:48.734
[Robert] Should anyone
encounter the Dougherty gang.

1127
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:50.485
they're asked not to engage

1128
00:51:50.694 --> 00:51:52.613
and to contact
authorities immediately.

1129
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:55.157
These are ruthless criminals
that should be considered

1130
00:51:55.365 --> 00:51:58.493
-armed and extremely dangerous.
-[plate breaks]

1131
00:51:58.702 --> 00:51:59.995
[Harold] Everything
all right in there. Loretta?

1132
00:52:00.204 --> 00:52:02.414
[Loretta] Ah... Yeah. um...

1133
00:52:02.623 --> 00:52:04.333
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1134
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:06.585
Would you all excuse me
just a moment?

1135
00:52:07.753 --> 00:52:10.297
[coughs]

1136
00:52:11.215 --> 00:52:13.675
Look. I understand we gotta do
what we gotta do and all that.

1137
00:52:13.884 --> 00:52:15.761
but these people
seem really nice.

1138
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:18.847
And they make
really good chicken. too.

1139
00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:22.142
You all right. bro?

1140
00:52:22.351 --> 00:52:23.852
Something ain't right.

1141
00:52:25.646 --> 00:52:26.855
What do you mean?

1142
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.825
So. you... uh...

1143
00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:40.202
You gonna be staying long?

1144
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.037
Depends.

1145
00:52:42.246 --> 00:52:44.331
Why you ask? [coughs]

1146
00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:47.876
No particular reason.
it's just that...

1147
00:52:48.085 --> 00:52:49.962
most folks just
passing through here.

1148
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.839
there's not much for 'em.

1149
00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.847
Pie.

1150
00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:03.892
-Excuse me?
-Where's the pie? [coughs]

1151
00:53:08.438 --> 00:53:11.108
-You said you were getting pie!
-[Ryan] Goddamn it. Dylan!

1152
00:53:11.316 --> 00:53:12.985
Dylan. what the hell
are you doing?

1153
00:53:13.193 --> 00:53:14.820
What is it that you're
needing. young man?

1154
00:53:15.028 --> 00:53:16.321
I'm needing you both
to stand up.

1155
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.698
walk towards
the back of the house.

1156
00:53:17.906 --> 00:53:19.074
-Harold.
-[Grace] Dylan.

1157
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:20.367
What's your goddamn problem?

1158
00:53:20.576 --> 00:53:21.910
-They like us.
-My problem?

1159
00:53:22.119 --> 00:53:24.204
You and your goddamn
blabbermouth.

1160
00:53:24.413 --> 00:53:25.789
-They're onto us.
-[Grace] Onto us?

1161
00:53:25.998 --> 00:53:28.000
-[Grace] You're paranoid.
-Oh. am I? Really?

1162
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:31.128
Or maybe you're just a little
too fucked up to notice. huh!

1163
00:53:31.336 --> 00:53:33.463
-[Grace] Fucking dickhead!
-[Dylan] Your fucking pills!

1164
00:53:33.672 --> 00:53:35.716
They ain't our friends
and this ain't our home!

1165
00:53:35.924 --> 00:53:38.802
We ain't got no home and no one
gives a shit about us but us.

1166
00:53:39.011 --> 00:53:41.054
Now. stand up. walk towards
the back of the house.

1167
00:53:41.263 --> 00:53:42.431
-Bro!
-No. Dylan!

1168
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:43.557
-Don't hurt them.
-I said stand up!

1169
00:53:43.765 --> 00:53:44.808
Please. don't hurt them!

1170
00:53:45.017 --> 00:53:46.518
They treated us like family!

1171
00:53:46.727 --> 00:53:47.978
Ryan. you take your sister
out to the car

1172
00:53:48.187 --> 00:53:49.313
and you wait for me there.

1173
00:53:49.521 --> 00:53:51.064
-[Ryan] Dylan--
-Do it! Now!

1174
00:53:51.273 --> 00:53:53.775
-Out! Out!
-[crying] Oh. my God!

1175
00:53:53.984 --> 00:53:56.320
Out! I gotta say it again?!

1176
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.117
Will you two kindly walk
towards the back of the house?

1177
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:03.577
-[coughs]
-[crying]

1178
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:11.126
[sniffling]

1179
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.885
-[Grace sniffling]
-Hey. it's all right.

1180
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.471
It's all going to be okay.

1181
00:54:24.556 --> 00:54:25.933
I'm scared. Ryan.

1182
00:54:27.684 --> 00:54:28.685
What are you scared of?

1183
00:54:31.188 --> 00:54:33.482
[sniffling] Of what
Dylan is capable of.

1184
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:36.735
He's just making sure everything
is all right. that's all.

1185
00:54:38.195 --> 00:54:40.030
Nothing to worry about.

1186
00:54:41.365 --> 00:54:42.407
[sniffling]

1187
00:54:42.616 --> 00:54:43.992
Not just with them.

1188
00:54:48.914 --> 00:54:49.998
With us.

1189
00:54:50.916 --> 00:54:53.168
[ragged breathing]

1190
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.005
Over in that corner! Now!

1191
00:54:57.214 --> 00:54:59.049
What have you got?
Bunch of nothing.

1192
00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:03.011
Fuck it! This? Huh? What else?
What else have you got?

1193
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.264
-This shit? Come on. now.
-That's it!

1194
00:55:05.472 --> 00:55:07.099
Old people always got cash
lying around.

1195
00:55:07.307 --> 00:55:09.059
[Harold] That's it! That's it!

1196
00:55:09.268 --> 00:55:10.811
We don't keep much here
at the house.

1197
00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:12.938
Oh. yeah? Let me guess. huh?

1198
00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:15.315
Fucking safety deposit box
at the bank.

1199
00:55:15.524 --> 00:55:17.109
Don't you know
banks get robbed?!

1200
00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:18.777
You can trust me on that one.

1201
00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:21.488
Hey. don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

1202
00:55:21.697 --> 00:55:23.866
[gasping]

1203
00:55:30.497 --> 00:55:32.082
I want you to know
something. son.

1204
00:55:34.585 --> 00:55:36.461
Want you to know that
we forgive you.

1205
00:55:40.507 --> 00:55:42.759
[breathing heavily]

1206
00:55:45.804 --> 00:55:47.306
[Dylan] Fuck!

1207
00:56:01.028 --> 00:56:03.906
[Dylan coughing]

1208
00:56:08.327 --> 00:56:09.453
[continues coughing]

1209
00:56:11.663 --> 00:56:12.748
Fuck! Let's go.

1210
00:56:12.956 --> 00:56:14.041
Jesus. Dylan. you all right?

1211
00:56:14.249 --> 00:56:15.250
[Grace] What happened?

1212
00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:16.335
[Grace] Dylan. what happened?

1213
00:56:16.543 --> 00:56:18.212
I said. let's go!

1214
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.505
Tell me what you did.

1215
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:22.174
I did what I always do.

1216
00:56:22.382 --> 00:56:24.510
[coughs]

1217
00:56:24.718 --> 00:56:26.053
I failed.

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.475
Thích Quang Duc.

1393
01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:55.187
Check your brother. Ryan.
I think he's just had a stroke.

1394
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.648
[Dylan] He was a Buddhist monk.

1395
01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:02.194
He was a martyr
in the Vietnam conflict.

1396
01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:05.989
I saw it recently
on one of them. um.

1397
01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:08.075
history television shows.

1398
01:05:10.244 --> 01:05:11.995
He and his fellow monks.

1399
01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:14.623
they were protesting
the tyranny of the...

1400
01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:18.502
current government
under the world they lived in.

1401
01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:22.631
So. Duc volunteered
to self-immolate.

1402
01:05:24.383 --> 01:05:27.219
-"Immolate"?
-Immolate.

1403
01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:32.516
He burned himself.
set himself on fire.

1404
01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:34.434
-Jesus.
-[coughs]

1405
01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:36.687
He and a few hundred
of his fellow pacifists

1406
01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:40.315
marched right down
the streets of Saigon.

1407
01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:43.861
Found a busy corner.

1408
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:46.405
old Duc reverently squatted.

1409
01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:50.075
doused himself with gasoline
in dead silence.

1410
01:05:50.284 --> 01:05:51.368
[imitates fire sizzling]

1411
01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:55.539
Poof. up he went in flames.

1412
01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.125
Why are you telling us
this. Dylan?

1413
01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.544
It's gonna give me
goddamn nightmares.

1414
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.882
'Cause when he and his brothers
had no other way

1415
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:07.259
to get their voices heard.

1416
01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.136
they made
the ultimate statement.

1417
01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:12.848
His death made a difference.

1418
01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:16.977
Made a stand for something.
for what's right.

1419
01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.689
Goddamn!

1420
01:06:20.898 --> 01:06:23.025
Well. it's pretty amazing

1421
01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:26.361
what people are capable of
when they're pushed far enough.

1422
01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:33.869
[Ryan imitates crow cawing]

1423
01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.412
What the hell are you doing?

1424
01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:38.498
-I'm practicing. [cawing]
-[laughing]

1425
01:06:38.707 --> 01:06:40.459
[Grace] For what. the loony bin?

1426
01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:43.128
No. Not the loony bin.

1427
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:47.049
I was just thinking about this
story that Daddy told me once.

1428
01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:49.468
About crows.

1429
01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:53.347
[indistinct video chatter]

1430
01:06:53.555 --> 01:06:56.683
[Ryan] He said that
in the beginning

1431
01:06:56.892 --> 01:06:58.727
when God created everything.

1432
01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:01.563
all the crows. they were
spread out everywhere.

1433
01:07:03.482 --> 01:07:05.150
They couldn't find each other.

1434
01:07:06.735 --> 01:07:10.405
So God gave them
this screeching call

1435
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.450
so through all the darkness.

1436
01:07:13.659 --> 01:07:15.994
and the distance.
and the fuss...

1437
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.207
they'd always know everything
was gonna be okay

1438
01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.583
'cause they weren't alone.

1439
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.962
They had each other.

1440
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.588
[kids laughing]

1441
01:07:28.382 --> 01:07:30.217
That's the most important thing.

1442
01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.388
So. I'm practicing in case
I ever lose you guys.

1443
01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:36.431
[cawing]

1444
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.559
-[Dylan laughs]
-[Grace chuckles] You're crazy.

1445
01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:40.769
Those were the days.
Right. Dilly?

1446
01:07:40.978 --> 01:07:42.604
We were together.

1447
01:07:42.813 --> 01:07:46.024
All we cared about was messing
with bikes and girls.

1448
01:07:48.277 --> 01:07:50.195
Things were so simple back then.

1449
01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:54.950
Shit. I remember every
piece of stranger I ever got.

1450
01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:57.035
[Grace] Know what?
You're so gross.

1451
01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.704
There's nothing quite
like your first time.

1452
01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:01.164
You remember your first time.
don't you. Dilly?

1453
01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:02.541
Hell. yes. I do.

1454
01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:04.168
Marie Jo Thompson.

1455
01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:06.295
I was sure I was in love.

1456
01:08:06.503 --> 01:08:08.630
-[chuckles]
-What about you. Gracie?

1457
01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:10.257
You remember your first time?

1458
01:08:13.135 --> 01:08:15.929
-Idiot.
-No. it's okay.

1459
01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:18.348
It is what it is
at this point. right?

1460
01:08:18.557 --> 01:08:21.685
Listen. I'm sorry. Gracie.
I wasn't thinking.

1461
01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:23.770
I'll tell you.
keeping all this shit in...

1462
01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:28.817
gets real fucking tiresome
after a while.

1463
01:08:36.074 --> 01:08:37.826
For some strange reason.

1464
01:08:39.369 --> 01:08:41.163
I thought that man
was so handsome.

1465
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:43.290
-Oh. Gracie.
-Yeah. fuck off. Dylan.

1466
01:08:43.498 --> 01:08:45.292
This is my turn. All right?

1467
01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.212
Back when Daddy died and...

1468
01:08:49.463 --> 01:08:51.840
there was that other. you know?

1469
01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:53.509
I was little and I thought.

1470
01:08:53.717 --> 01:08:55.761
"Yeah. this one's a prince."

1471
01:08:57.638 --> 01:09:01.183
Only 'cause he was tall
with dark. curly hair.

1472
01:09:01.391 --> 01:09:03.602
It's funny 'cause I look back
at the pictures and...

1473
01:09:04.937 --> 01:09:06.480
he wasn't. [chuckles]

1474
01:09:07.981 --> 01:09:08.982
He was ugly. and...

1475
01:09:09.191 --> 01:09:10.567
[echo of banging]

1476
01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:12.152
...he was plain.

1477
01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:19.243
It's funny how we see
things when we're kids.

1478
01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:21.245
[young girl's pained whimpering]

1479
01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:24.331
Then. as an adult.
you're just smacked

1480
01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.834
with the reality
of what they really were.

1481
01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.965
-[glass breaks]
-He actually broke my heart.

1482
01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:37.678
-He wasn't...
-Yeah.

1483
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.349
Eventually. I got older
and he lost interest.

1484
01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:45.602
But when he actually
stopped. it...

1485
01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.606
hurt so bad.

1486
01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:55.821
He broke my heart.

1487
01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:02.369
My goddamn... [scoffs] prince.

1488
01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:06.456
[somber music playing]

1489
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.841
Where are you going?

1490
01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.050
Clearing my head.

1491
01:10:17.259 --> 01:10:18.343
Don't wait up.

1492
01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:24.933
[sighs]

1493
01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:32.357

[chuckling]

1502
01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:15.067
-Come on.
-Don't!

1503
01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:16.485
[man] Do it.

1504
01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:17.653
Don't! Please. stop it!

1505

[Grace screaming]

1506

Stop it! Stop it!

1509
01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:28.830
Go!

Leave me alone!

[panting. crying]

1512
01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.716
Take that! Leave me alone!

1513
01:11:39.925 --> 01:11:41.343
[repeatedly clicking]

1514
01:11:48.684 --> 01:11:49.893
Any sign of him?

1515
01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:51.061
No.

1516
01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:53.647
No. not yet.

1517
01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:55.524
Why aren't you sleeping?

1518
01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:58.277
I can't.

1519
01:12:00.779 --> 01:12:02.698
Keep dreaming about my boy.

1520
01:12:03.574 --> 01:12:05.951
I could see exactly
what he looked like.

1521
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:08.537
He was like two or three
or something.

1522
01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:12.082
I can smell his smell.

1523
01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.877
I could even hear his voice.

1524
01:12:15.085 --> 01:12:16.336
Yeah. he's...

1525
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.882
I felt at peace.

1526
01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:26.013
Oh. honey. that's a good dream.
[chuckles]

1527
01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:27.598
I don't know.

1528
01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:30.434
What if I never get
to see any of it?

1529
01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:31.643
You know?

1530
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:34.354
What if it's all just a dream.

1531
01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:36.440
and that's all
it's ever gonna be?

1532
01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.319
[Dylan panting]

1533
01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:47.534
[Dylan] Hello?

1534
01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:49.453
Hello?

1535
01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:55.125
Anybody here?

1536
01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:14.061
I don't know. Gracie.

1537
01:13:15.812 --> 01:13:19.149
I'm starting to feel like we're
coming to the end of the road.

1538
01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:20.859
Before. I could see it.

1539
01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:23.070
I could.

1540
01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.031
Now...

1541
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.077
all I see is darkness.

1542
01:13:30.285 --> 01:13:31.954
Ryan. I...

1543
01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:35.958
Oh. hey. You all right?

1544
01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.251
[Dylan] Yeah.

1545
01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:42.422
Found some stuff.
but I need some help.

1546
01:13:42.631 --> 01:13:43.715
Come on.

1547
01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:51.265
Looked earlier.
ain't seen a sign of no one.

1548
01:13:51.473 --> 01:13:53.225
Look for first-aid kits.

1549
01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:55.686
more blankets. food. tools.

1550
01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:57.479
Anything we can use.

1551
01:13:57.688 --> 01:14:00.232
Hey. we're gonna leave cash
for anything we take.

1552
01:14:14.913 --> 01:14:16.582
[man] What are you doing
with our things?

1553
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:18.792
-[gun cocks]
-[Grace] Ryan.

1554
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:21.628
-It's just a family. relax.
-[Ryan] Hey. look. man.

1555
01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:24.840
We're just taking some things.

1556
01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:26.758
Gonna leave money.
Look. I got it here.

1557
01:14:28.969 --> 01:14:30.846
-It's right here.
-[kid] Daddy. the radio.

1558
01:14:31.054 --> 01:14:32.639
-It's the people the police...
-Hush.

1559
01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:35.142
Take what you want.
just don't hurt my family.

1560
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.895
No. man. We weren't
gonna hurt you.

1561
01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:40.522
We just needed some things.
and we couldn't go to the store.

1562
01:14:40.731 --> 01:14:43.108
-We are gonna pay for it.
-[man] Take what you need.

1563
01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:46.278
We can act like
this never happened.

1564
01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:56.330
Tie 'em up.

1565

-Wait. what?
-[Grace] Dylan.

1567
01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:01.919
Goddamn it. I said tie 'em up!

1568
01:15:04.463 --> 01:15:06.340
[Grace] They're just a family.
Dylan. What are you doing?

1569
01:15:06.548 --> 01:15:09.927
Yeah. well. family sucks
sometimes. don't it?

1570
01:15:11.303 --> 01:15:12.429
[Grace] No.

1571
01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:13.889
[cocks gun]

1572
01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:19.937
Got a bad habit of getting
in my way. Lee-Grace.

1573
01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:21.522
What are you gonna do.
Dylan? Huh?

1574
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.065
What are you gonna do?
Tear 'em apart

1575
01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:24.900
like we were torn apart. huh?

1576
01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:26.777
Destroy 'em
like we were destroyed?

1577
01:15:26.985 --> 01:15:28.612
Is that what this is all about?

1578
01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.114
-Lee-Grace.
-No. Dylan.

1579
01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:32.741
No. it's done. It's over.

1580
01:15:33.951 --> 01:15:35.077
Now. we're gonna
let these people go.

1581
01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:36.328
They don't deserve this.

1582
01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:39.248
Get out of here.

1583
01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:40.916
Get. goddamn it! Move!

1584
01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:45.128
Go! Don't look back!

1585
01:15:45.337 --> 01:15:48.507
You realize
they'll tell the authorities.

1586
01:15:48.715 --> 01:15:50.926
We're as good as dead now.

1587
01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.595
Weren't we already?

1588
01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:06.358
All this. and then in the end.
just gave up.

1589
01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:09.778
[Grace] I know you think
you forced me to come. Dylan.

1590
01:16:09.987 --> 01:16:12.698
But I got a news flash for you.
I wanted this.

1591
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.369
I wanted for us all
to be together.

1592
01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:20.080
And I didn't care where we got
or how we got there.

1593
01:16:20.289 --> 01:16:21.874
just as long
as we were together.

1594
01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:24.960
A family.

1595
01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:27.504
The family we always
could have been

1596
01:16:27.713 --> 01:16:29.381
if life just hadn't
kept dealing us

1597
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:31.425
one fucked up hand
after another after another.

1598
01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:34.595
And you know. maybe we were
too young to know any different.

1599
01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.226
But there was a point...

1600
01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:46.481
when everything was okay.

1601
01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:52.237
When it was safe and sane.

1602
01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:56.950
Don't you remember that?

1603
01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:01.538
Did it really happen.
'cause I...

1604
01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:02.873
I need to know...

1605
01:17:04.124 --> 01:17:05.876
because I mourn that.

1606
01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:08.712
I mourn what we had.

1607
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:10.923
[father] Oh. my gosh.
look at you. buddy.

1608
01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:14.676
-You got so tall.
-I know.

1609
01:17:14.885 --> 01:17:16.970
[Grace] I mourn
the kids we were.

1611
01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:24.520
[crying] It wasn't supposed
to turn out this way. Dylan.

1612
01:17:24.728 --> 01:17:25.896
Was it?

1613
01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:28.023
Our lives...

1614
01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:33.195
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1618
01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:44.540
There's still a chance.
There's still hope.

1619
01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:46.875
What the fuck are you
talking about. Dylan?

1620
01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:49.503
Back off. Ryan.
This doesn't concern you.

1621
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:51.171
It concerns me.

1622
01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:53.465
It concerns all of us.

1623
01:17:56.134 --> 01:17:58.804
No. it doesn't.

1624
01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.056
This is between me and Gracie.

1625
01:18:01.265 --> 01:18:02.850
Now back the fuck off.

1626
01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:04.101
You ain't our daddy. Dylan.

1627
01:18:04.309 --> 01:18:05.310
Back the fuck off. Ryan!

1628
01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:06.645
I ain't gonna ask you again.

1629
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.313
You need to understand that!

1630
01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:11.316
You ain't our daddy!

1631
01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:14.027
You never were. man.

1632
01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:16.280
You know why?

1633
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:19.032
He wouldn't have left us.

1634
01:18:20.367 --> 01:18:21.743
He didn't have a choice.

1635
01:18:24.121 --> 01:18:25.122
You did.

1636
01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:27.457
I'll teach you to talk
that shit to me.

1637
01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:29.126
[both grunting]

1638
01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:36.216
No. Dylan. Get off him.

1639
01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:38.051
-Move.
-[pants]

1640
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.303
Fuck.

1641
01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:43.765
[Ryan] Why did you
leave us. Dylan?

1642
01:18:43.974 --> 01:18:45.350
Huh?

1643
01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.562
You promised.

1644
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.273
It wasn't his fault. Ryan.
It wasn't his fault.

1645
01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:53.150
You-- we all know
why he was sent away.

1646
01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:54.693
Shit was fucked up.
and Dylan knew it.

1647
01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:56.278
and that's why
they sent him away.

1648
01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.032
[Dylan] You're wrong. Lee-Grace.

1649
01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.366
[Grace] What?

1650
01:19:02.326 --> 01:19:03.744
I said. "You're wrong."

1651
01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:08.248
I wasn't sent away.

1652
01:19:10.292 --> 01:19:11.502
I left.

1653
01:19:13.253 --> 01:19:16.089
I was 16 by then.
I could do what I wanted.

1654
01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:18.759
I begged to leave.

1655
01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:22.054
I couldn't stand it no more.

1656
01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:25.974
I knew what was going on.
all of it.

1657
01:19:26.183 --> 01:19:28.060
to you. to Ryan.

1658
01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:30.312
I was too scared to do
anything about it.

1659
01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:32.105
so I left.

1660
01:19:32.314 --> 01:19:33.690
Turned my back on everyone

1661
01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:35.484
and everything about me.

1662
01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:36.693
My choice.

1663
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:38.195
And I didn't even look back.

1664
01:19:38.403 --> 01:19:40.155
-Dylan.
-It's the truth.

1665
01:19:41.615 --> 01:19:44.576
But I want you to know.
I died with that...

1666
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:48.914
knowing you and Ryan
were left unsafe.

1667

[sobbing]

1668
01:19:50.749 --> 01:19:53.460
I saw how things turned out
and I just...

1669
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:56.255
I just wanted to make it
safe again.

1670
01:19:56.463 --> 01:19:58.715
You know. like... [sobs]

1671
01:19:58.924 --> 01:19:59.967
...put it in a little box

1672
01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:01.927
and just wrap my arms around it.

1673
01:20:02.135 --> 01:20:04.137
run through the
goddamn fire if I had to.

1674
01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:06.974
but make it safe.
no matter what.

1675
01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:10.102
All I can say. Dylan...

1676
01:20:12.354 --> 01:20:14.648
is that's the past
and you can't change that.

1677
01:20:14.857 --> 01:20:17.526
Oh. don't you understand. man?

1678
01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:22.155
I... I made a promise.

1679
01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:25.909
I broke that promise
the day I left.

1680
01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:27.619
Can you forgive me?

1681
01:20:27.828 --> 01:20:29.788
[crying]

1682
01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.835
I wanna go home now.

01:20:37.379 --> 01:20:40.007
I know things can't go back
to the way they were before.

1684
01:20:41.133 --> 01:20:43.135
Shit. who'd want 'em to?

1685
01:20:43.343 --> 01:20:45.095
But my boy is
coming any day now.

1686
01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:46.680
and I'm going to see that.

1687
01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:52.269
They can lock me away after.
but I'm gonna have that.

[Dylan cries]

1689
01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:59.985

of all of this.

1690
01:21:00.194 --> 01:21:01.612

01:24:26.066 --> 01:24:27.109
Fuck.

1740
01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:29.987
Yeah. actually.

1741

Everything is okay.

[dramatic music building]

1743
01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:21.788
I always find this the weirdest
part about what we do.

-What's that?
-The take-down.

Game over. man.

1749
01:25:32.591 --> 01:25:33.759
How is that weird?

[indistinct police

1751
01:25:37.095 --> 01:25:38.972
I don't know. man.
it's just weird.

1752
01:25:40.766 --> 01:25:42.684
Most times life's just
a big bag of suck

1753

1754
01:25:44.353 --> 01:25:46.939
I got a question for you. Agent.

1755
01:25:47.147 --> 01:25:48.690
Yeah? Fire away.

1756
01:25:50.025 --> 01:25:51.527
When did you get like this. man?

1757
01:25:52.486 --> 01:25:56.573
Get like what? Bitter?
Jaded? Soured by life?

1758
01:25:57.908 --> 01:25:59.368
No.

1759
01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:00.786
Alone.

1760
01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:02.871
Yeah. well...

1761
01:26:04.373 --> 01:26:07.042
The reality is. kid.
you come into this world alone

1762
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:08.502
and you leave it alone.

1763
01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:11.129
The only surprise...

1764
01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:13.924
You eventually realize
that the middle part

1765

as long as we keep up
a good pace.

1770
01:26:25.853 --> 01:26:27.354
we'll be back
in two or three days.

[Grace] If we consider
turning ourselves in.

1772
01:26:29.147 --> 01:26:30.482
then the authorities
will be able to see

1773
01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:31.984
that we came back
of our own volition and--

and face the music.

1777

into consideration.

Pick up speed.

[Grace] Should we...
Should we stop?

1791
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.267
Should we see? Like...

1792
01:27:05.475 --> 01:27:07.144

There's more.

And this...

first. ask questions later.

if we run. huh?

1800

What happens then? Fuck!

I'm scared. I'm scared.
What do we do?

1802

before. we change the song.

See. the truth is we ain't
never had a chance.

1810

But we do have a choice.

1811
01:27:46.558 --> 01:27:49.394
To go out with our heads up
and our goddamn boots on.

1812

to listen to me. okay?

have to end their way.

for us at the end of all this.

existed for us

in that story.

01:33:35.616 --> 01:33:37.492
Huerfano County Jail officials

1912
01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:40.245
claim that they foiled
an escape attempt master-minded

1913
01:33:40.454 --> 01:33:42.039
by Dylan Dougherty.
the older brother.

1914
01:33:42.247 --> 01:33:43.957
An arrest affidavit indicates

1915
01:33:44.166 --> 01:33:46.376
Dylan Dougherty.
shown here on the left.

1916
01:33:46.585 --> 01:33:50.047
actually got out of his cell
through a plumbing access panel.

1917
01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:52.466
and passed a note
to his sister. Lee-Grace.

1918
01:33:52.674 --> 01:33:54.218
promising to break her out.

1919
01:33:54.426 --> 01:33:55.969
Deputies say they found
a homemade knife

1920
01:33:56.178 --> 01:33:58.055
and a letter in Dylan's cell.

1921
01:33:58.263 --> 01:34:00.724
The note allegedly detailed
plans to subdue the guards.

1922
01:34:00.933 --> 01:34:02.935
steal keys. and escape together.

1923
01:34:03.143 --> 01:34:06.563
Now. there is no mention of the
third sibling. Ryan Dougherty.

1924
01:34:06.772 --> 01:34:08.482
The three siblings face
attempted murder

1925
01:34:08.690 --> 01:34:10.359
and firearm charges
stemming from

1926
01:34:10.567 --> 01:34:12.778
an eight-day crime spree
that included shooting

1927
01:34:12.986 --> 01:34:14.655
at a Zephyrhills
police officer...

1928
01:34:14.863 --> 01:34:17.616
[pensive music playing]

1929
01:34:42.391 --> 01:34:44.309
Contrary to a lot
of people's belief.

1930
01:34:44.518 --> 01:34:46.603
I... I never intended to.

1931
01:34:46.812 --> 01:34:48.230
I never tried to.

1932
01:34:48.438 --> 01:34:50.399
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

1933
01:34:51.984 --> 01:34:53.360
[sighs]

1934
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.783
It is true that I acted
out of desperation.

1935
01:34:59.992 --> 01:35:02.202
[sniffling]

1936
01:35:10.294 --> 01:35:13.422
And I am sorry for
the choices that I made.

1937
01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:14.923
[judge] It's not something...

1938
01:35:16.133 --> 01:35:18.385
that the court takes
any pleasure in.

1939
01:35:18.594 --> 01:35:20.262
it's what I think is required.

1940
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:22.806
And I hope you find
some. ah. value

1941
01:35:23.015 --> 01:35:24.600
