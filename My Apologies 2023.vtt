62
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.640
-CANAN: I have to tell him everything.
-What's this? Is there a war on?

I want to capture the moment...

70
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.000
and start all over again
with that first flush of love.

71
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.160

-Excuse me?
-Hold it one second. One second!

76
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.720

-I don't want to get married.
-Shut up for once! Killjoy!

78

Why?

79
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.160
If you're after a reason.

80
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.360

But I have to say this.

Screw the trees that give you oxygen.
Okay?

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.480
Did you call to say "unfortunately"?

175
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.160
SEFA: <i>Unfortunately.</i>
<i>we've lost your grandfather.</i>

176
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.520
Of course you have!

177
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.400
Didn't I warn you not to let him out.
that he's a serial womanizer?

178
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.840
See? He's disappeared.

179
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.400
SEFA: <i>Mr. Erkin. Your grandfather is dead.</i>

180
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840
Dead?

181
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160
SEFA: <i>Unfortunately.</i>

182
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.760
(solemn music)

183
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.520
(sobs softly)

184
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800
(solemn music rises)

185
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.320
(Erkin sobbing)

186
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.960
-Unfortunately.
-(breathes heavily)

187
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.280
Oh. grandpa.

188
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.560
(sobbing)

189
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.880
(sniffles)

190
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.240
Has he begun to smell?

191
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.640
-Oh my God!
-You rat!

192
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.160
How about saying rest in peace?

193
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.160
How about shedding a few tears?
What do you mean I smell?

194
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.440
Grandpa? Aren't you dead?

195
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.640
Do I look dead?

196
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.760
Smell-wise. yes.

197
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.840
I have high blood pressure.
I eat five cloves of garlic a day.

198
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.760
Thanks so much. Mr. Sefa.

199
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.200
He insisted. I couldn't say no.
Unfortunately...

200
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.040
-Grandpa? Why did you do this?
-(door closes)

201
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.200
Do I have to die for you to visit me?

202
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.240
But you know how busy I am.

203
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.080
Busy. my ass! You guard a lighthouse.

204
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.320
Don't I know you? We're the same man.
Irresponsible. selfish asshole!

205
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.280
Asshole. okay.
But I'm not selfish. No way.

206
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.280
I'm dying here alone. don't you see?

207
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.960
Don't say that. grandpa. I'm here for you.

208
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.840
The hell you are!

209
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.600
That idiot brother of yours
calls twice a year and that's it.

210
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.280
Still not speaking. are you?

211
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.080
He won't speak to me.

212
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.040
And you dumped the girl
you proposed to at Koray's wedding.

213
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.800
Look. son. I don't want you
to have the same regrets as me. okay?

214
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.360
Grandpa. I know what you're trying to do.
Thanks. but I'm up the creek as it is.

215
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440
What do you mean?

216
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.600
Here. look.

217
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.280
I'll go to jail if I don't pay off
my loan in a week.

218
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.680
You were gambling again. right?

219
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.240
No! Me. gamble?

220
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.920
But you should never bet
on Germany's third league.

221
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.680
-Piece of shit!
-Fuck your mother!

222
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.440
-You loser!
-Asshole!

223
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.680
Right. asshole!

224
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.200
How much do you owe?

225
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.640
180.000.

226
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.040
I'd never usually pay up.
but this is different.

227
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.480
But I have one condition.

228
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560
What's that?

229
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.440
You have one week to say sorry
to your brother and ex-fiancée.

230
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.080
and have them forgive you.

231
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.640
Man! Pay the money if you're going to
and quit the lectures.

232
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.240
Take it or leave it.

233
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.040
Listen to me. Grandpa. Look...

234
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120
Mr. Yüksel!

235
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.560
Ah. Ms. Sevil! Hello.

236
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.720
My grandson Erkin came to visit.

237
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.000
My son's coming in two hours.

238
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.000
Where to now?

239
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.240
The garden. for some fresh air.

240
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.480
No need. Ms. Sevil.
You're already fresh as a daisy.

241
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
(chuckles)

242
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.720
You're quite the charmer.
Mr. Yüksel. See you later.

243
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.800
Grandpa? You make eyes at the women here?

244
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.640
In my youth. I'd hit on them.
Now I'm old. I just make eyes.

245
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.440
Hand over the cash.

246
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.560
Look. son. I won't let you die alone.
Get that in your head.

247
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.560
That's my last word.

248
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.120
I'm leaving! And that's my last word.

249
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.840
Fuck you!
Sorry. turns out that's my last word!

250
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.240

My brother and grandfather.

I thought you didn't have any family.

265
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.840

How could you have a fiancée?

269
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560
Why would anyone get engaged to you?
How desperate is that?

270
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.400
Can you please leave?
If you don't. we'll get engaged.

Koray.

-His sister-in-law.
-Sister-in-law?

304
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.600
His big brother of course!

305
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.160
He's the spitting image of me. right?
We're like twins!

306
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.360
Sister-in-law made more sense.
I didn't even know Koray had a brother.

Where is Koray?

He's with the bees.

309

Bees? No way! We're both allergic to them.

310

Don't go there unprotected.

Guys. look. For two years we haven't
produced a gram of honey. Why?

318
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.360
I'm waiting for an answer. queen.

319
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.880
The guys work all day to keep you happy.

320
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.360
You're the queen! Forget your chances
if you freeze them all out.

321
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.840
Worker bee comes to your room at night.

322
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.360
You slip into something loose.
You take lover boy into a corner.

323
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.240
Bzz-bzz-bzz. you do the business.
What's the big deal?

324
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.400
(Erkin sighs)

325
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.720
What are you doing here?

326
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.440
How about a. "Welcome. bro"? Animal!

327
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.440
Get the hell out of here. Fast!

328
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.960
Koray. Bro.
We haven't spoken for five years.

329
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.640
How many more will it take to make up?
One? Two? Three?

330
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.920
Seriously. get the hell...

331
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.680
I'm not done yet!

332
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.440
Four? Five? Six?

333
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.640
-Go before I...
-Don't butt in!

334
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.920
Seven? Eight? Nine? Ten!

335
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.920
-Come here!
-Don't fight by the bees!

336
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.080
They'll get even more manic!

337
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.880
KORAY: Stay out of my bees' private lives!

338
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.440
Koray! I have something big to say.

339
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.880
Let's hear it.

340
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.280
Eleven? Twelve? Thirteen?

341
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.520
-You came here to count. asshole?
-(Erkin screams)

342
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.720
Oh. God.

343
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.800
Keep quiet.
We're allergic to them. remember?

344
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.960
Wait. Is that the queen in the middle?

345
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.560
I told you to keep quiet.

346
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.760
She's a sexy beast. though.

347
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400
(upbeat music)

348
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.480
Run!

349
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.080
Run! Run!

350
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.000
You show up years later and screw me
straight off. Look at me!

351
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.640
No. look at me! What's this?

352
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.800
Sorry. doctor. Just a brotherly spat.

353
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.360
-He's your brother? So glad to meet you.
-You too.

354
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.240
Don't worry. you'll be up an hour
after the IV's done.

355
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.960
Doctor! Are you a little too glad?

356
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.960
Sorry. I got distracted.
I'll leave you to it. Have a good rest.

357
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.000
Thanks.

358
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.440
You saw the doctor eyeing my boobs?

359
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.720
Bull! What are your boobs to him?

360
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.560
What do you mean?
I'm hot. Even I like them.

361
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.320
Bro. why did you come?

362
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.000
Didn't I say
I never want to see you again?

363
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.160
Koray. How many more years
before we make up? One?

364
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.320
You want me to bash your boobs?

365
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.880
No. don't! They hurt.

366
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.080
-Grandpa wanted me to.
-Grandpa?

367
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.840
He said.
"I won't let you die alone like me.

368
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.640
Say sorry to your brother.
have him forgive you."

369
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.520
-So you came right over. For love?
-Of course!

370
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.240
-I'll bash your boobs.
-(screams)

371
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.120
-They hurt!
-Tell the truth.

372
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.360
Okay. Grandpa promised to pay off
my loan in return.

373
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.560
That's better! Now I've got you.
Keep talking.

374
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.960
Bro. I'll do anything for you
to forgive me. Anything you want.

375
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.160
You're gross!

376
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.960
Wait for a second. Anything I want?

377
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.320
-Is this the wife?
-Yes. the wife.

378
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.640
She's alright.

379
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.960
I'm a live-in son-in-law thanks to you!
I depend on others for a living!

380
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.640
Okay. I accept blame
for the failed wedding.

381
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.000
But you being a live-in son-in-law?
You're just after money.

382
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.280
What do you expect? Huh?

383
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.840
Didn't you blow our life savings.
the money for our restaurant business.

384
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.040
on a single bet on Barcelona?

385
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.440
Don't say that name! I haven't said it
once since that dark day.

386
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.040
After you dumped me with a ton of debt.
these guys took me in.

387
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.640
My dad-in-law's a cranky piece of work
but I can't deny he's done a lot for me.

388
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.520
Which you paid for. and then some!

389
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.760
Give that here! She's my wife.

390
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.600
So. what do you want from me?

391
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.760
You know what I want?

392
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.320
-You stay for dinner.
-Yeah.

393
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.440
-My dad-in-law will be there.
-Yeah.

394
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.160
You tell him I want to divorce Asuman.

395
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.080
Why? Don't you love her?

396
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.440
She's a great girl.
but I'm not sure if I love her.

397
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.240
Being a live-in son-in-law sucks.

398
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320
Don't walk out on this fortune
and regret it later.

399
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.960
Don't worry. I won't. I'm not you.

400
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.680
-Really? You can't be me.
-Who'd want to be?

401
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.560
I make a living. I guard a lighthouse.

402
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.440
Like you do something at the lighthouse.
What do you do there?

403
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.040
What do you do here? Lick asses.

404
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.680
-Whose ass?
-Your dad-in-law's.

405
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.360
-Really?
-(clicks tongue mockingly)

406
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.680
-That's how you lick his ass.
-What? How?

407
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.480
-Did you come here to trash me? Open up!
-What are you doing?

408
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.600
-Don't touch!
-I'm going to piss on you.

409
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.360
Don't touch my boobs!

410
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.640
(groaning)

411
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.120
I'll suffocate you with my boobs!

412
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.200
These boobs will suffocate you!
I'll suffocate you! Hey!

413
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.520
-God!
-Stop!

414
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.760
(Erkin panting)

415
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.520
(breathes heavily)

416
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.840
It's your fault the bed broke!

417
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.840
It's the weight of those boobs
that broke it.

418
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.920
(sighs)
They hurt like hell.

419
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240
Enjoy!

420
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.480
-KORAY: Thanks.
-Thanks.

421
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.360
So. sister-in-law.
How did the big romance begin?

422
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.200
Koray and I are army buddies.

423
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.880
Army buddies?

424
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.560
You know those online games
where you build an army and go to war?

425
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.040
She means that.

426
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.120
Comrade... Cohort.

427
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.240
(Koray gasps)

428
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.840
So. how long till discharge?

429
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.240
Honey. don't! Not with guests here.
What do you want? An attack?

430
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.920
Comrade. I'll put you on watch tonight.

431
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.280
Sure. We'll do punishment training
if you like.

432
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.800
The army's ready for combat. okay?

433
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.760
Remember. I'm always up for close combat.

434
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.680
Guys. can you disband the army for a bit?

435
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.120
-(giggles)
-Let's give it a break.

436
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.000
-(Koray clears throat)
-We met playing that game

437
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.160
and fell in love at first sight.
And imagine. I was overweight back then.

438
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.520
-Overweight?
-Yeah.

439
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.800
She wasn't like how she is now.

440
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.320
-Really?
-(heavy metallic thumping)

441
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.280
(giggles)
Dad's on his way.

442
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.200
The general's coming!

443
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.640
(heavy metallic footsteps)

444
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.720
(tense music)

445
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.720
(music stops)

446
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.440
Welcome. Mr. Hicabi.

447
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.120
I was shocked today when Asuman
said Koray's brother was here.

448
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.880
I was even more shocked to see you.

449
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.240
Why?

450
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.760
Shocked that a couple would have you first
and then think.

451
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.840
"This is great. Let's have another."

452
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.760
It's beyond me.

453
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.200
(laughing)

454
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.600
Dad makes jokes like that all the time.
God. what a joke! I can't stop laughing...

455
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.440
-Son-in-law!
-I've stopped.

456
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.240
-Sweetie.
-Okay. I've stopped.

457
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.640
I'm joking. of course.

458
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.840
(heavy footsteps)

459
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.160
Since it's been a secret all this time
that my son-in-law has a brother.

460
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.600
there must be problems between you.

461
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.480
MR. HICABI: That's not my business.

462
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.600
What I want to know is why
you've turned up after all these years.

463
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.880
I missed my brother.

464
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.640
I wanted to see where he lives...
to meet his family.

465
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.440
So? What do you make
of your brother's life?

466
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.880
It's great! I love it!

467
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.680
Thanks so much for taking care
of my brother. He has a fabulous life.

468
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.960
(mouthing)
Get to the point.

469
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.160
But...

470
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.080
But what?

471
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.720
I was just thinking to myself
and wondering...

472
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.720
if Koray was on his own...

473
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.880
On his own?

474
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.320
No. with his wife. of course.
I was wondering if Koray and his wife...

475
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.280
might live in a different house?

476
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.120
So you're saying
the greatest asset in my life.

477
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.280
my only daughter.
should live away from her dad. Really?

478
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.920
-I...
-Do you hear yourself?

479
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.840
Her mother passed away. giving birth.

480
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.440
(Asuman sobs)

481
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.480
This girl was 9.5 kilos at birth.

482
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.640
-9.5 kilos?
-Round it up to 10.

483
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.240
I've been both a mother
and a father to her.

484
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.800
I still can't bear to put away her toys.

485
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.200
A horse in heat attacked her
in the stable.

486
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.720
I jumped in to rescue her
and was paralyzed in the confusion.

487
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.680
(Asuman sobs)

488
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.440
Just to spare her the pain
of seeing me in a wheelchair.

489
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.280
I strap on these robot legs
and wander about like Terminator.

490
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.400
I'm registered in Balikesir.

491
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:31.760
How ridiculous
is a Balikesir Terminator? Huh?

492
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.640
Mr. Hicabi. you get me wrong.
The fact is. Koray said...

493
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.240
What did I say? What kind of idea is that?

494
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.280
Why would I leave my home?
I'd refuse even if my wife agreed.

495
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.640
Where would we go without Dad?

496
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.160
Be thankful you're my bro and a guest.
Or I'd get up from this chair and fu...

497
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.400
Sweetie! Sweetie. calm down.

498
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.360
(inhales deeply)

499
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.440
As far as I'm concerned.
this dinner is over!

500
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.800
(heavy footsteps)

501
00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.640
(machine powers down)

502
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.320
My legs are out of charge.
Get the battery pack!

503
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.240
KORAY: Right away. Dad.

504
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.800
I'm changing it right now.

505
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280
(Koray clears throat)

506
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.440
(machine powers up)

507
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080
(spits)

508
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.080
(tense music)

509
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.240
Dad. wait. I'll be right there.

510
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.120
I'll plug this in to charge.

511
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.120
(both mouthing)

512
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.280
I'm on my way. Dad!

513
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.200
What was that about?

514
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.200
-(crickets chirping)
-(dog barking in distance)

515
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.160
(sniffs. groans)

516
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.600
(sighs)

517
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.040
(water sloshing)

518
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.320
(suspenseful music)

519
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.480
(screams)

520
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.800
(quirky music)

521
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.520
(Asuman snoring)

522
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.560
(whispers)
What the hell. Koray?

523
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.720
(shushes)

524
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.920
She fell asleep during sex.

525
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.200
What's that?

526
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.600
Your dad-in-law put it on my bed.
I was scared shitless.

527
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.120
-Give me a hand.
-Okay. I'll roll her over.

528
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.400
Get out at the count of three.

529
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.640
Okay. Help me.

530
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.000
Okay. Are you doing anything?

531
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.960
One. two. three.

532
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.040
(grunts)

533
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.240
Come on. Let's talk outside.

534
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.640
It's okay. she's a heavy sleeper.
Let's talk on my bed.

535
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.040
-You sleep in that bed?
-Yeah.

536
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.680
In a cat's bed?

537
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.360
Asuman can't sleep sharing a bed.
It's cozier than it looks.

538
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.240
Let's go.

539
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.160
(snoring)

540
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.960
(both grunt)

541
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.960
(Erkin exhales)

542
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.560
So let's hear it.

543
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.080
-Koray.
-Yeah.

544
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.040
Bro. You're right to be pissed.
I've messed you around a ton.

545
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.800
But you saw. right? I paid for it
at dinner. It wasn't meant to be.

546
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.440
Tell you what. though.
Let's do a video for Grandpa.

547
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.640
Say you forgive me and it's done.

548
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.000
You chickened! You were full of shit.

549
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.920
You said none of the stuff I wanted.

550
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.160
Tomorrow you repeat every word
to my dad-in-law. no ifs. no buts.

551
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.280
The guy flipped when I said you'd move.
If I say you want out. he'll kill me.

552
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.120
That's what I want. It'll be a relief.

553
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.520
Oh. my God! So you were waiting for me?
Do it yourself if you have balls!

554
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.040
I would've by now.

555
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.280
but the point is
you doing what I tell you.

556
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.120
Go be the guy's dog.
then try leaving this place!

557
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.480
What was I supposed to do?

558
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.000
-You can't do anything.
-Yeah. Okay.

559
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.320
They put your leash on.

560
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.400
Do you know what you should do?

561
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.520
You should lie back
and let them tickle your belly.

562
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.880
-Me? I can't do anything?
-No. you can't.

563
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.480
-Look over here. Here.
-Where?

564
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.840
-Screw your "I can't"! See how it's done?
-Ha. okay.

565
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.560
-Here. try this.
-I already did.

566
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.800
-Don't snap your fingers! She's asleep.
-I'm your big brother. Screw you!

567
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.160
It's your fault I have this horse head.

568
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.440
Know what? I'm tired. Get the fuck out!

569
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.520
I'm going. And you sleep here
like a cute kitty. okay?

570
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.880
-Piss off! Get out!
-I'm going anyway.

571
00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.040
Here.
(imitates horse neighing)

572
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.480
Moron! And he messed up my bed.

573
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.240
(cat meowing)

574
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.320
(quirky music)

575
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.520
(robotic machine whirring)

576
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.480
Morning. Mr. Hicabi!

577
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.000
Come join me. I wanted a word with you.

578
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.840
But first. see what I got you.
Today's your lucky day!

579
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.480
I heard your gear creaking last night.

580
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.360
Let me give it some oil.
and you'll be good as new.

581
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.880
You're creaking. I can hear it.
I'm good with mechanics.

582
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.600
What are you jabbering about?
Your brother has run away!

583
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.080
Run away?
No surprise if you let him off the leash.

584
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:03.120
He couldn't handle your insults.
This morning I woke to this message. Here.

585
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.520
<i>Dearest Dad. Popsicle.</i>
<i>And dearest heart. Baby doll!</i>

586
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.760
I didn't want to do this to you.
I still don't.

587
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.160
But last night. my brother came to my room
saying I'm a loser.

588
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.200
<i>I'm a dog to you.</i>

589
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.440
<i>I couldn't take the insults.</i>
<i>I'm really sorry on my brother's behalf.</i>

590
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.600
<i>He's to blame for breaking up our home.</i>

591
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.680
<i>Please don't do anything to him. Dad.</i>
<i>Or do.</i>

592
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.880
<i>So that he never breaks up</i>
<i>a happy home again.</i>

593
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.400
Bastard!

594
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.520
Now. look. Do whatever it takes
to find the guy. Make it up to him.

595
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.040
Find him where? He's a big guy.
He could be anywhere!

596
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.000
(machine whirring)

597
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.240
What is wrong with you?

598
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.360
No! What's wrong with you?

599
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.080
Treat him like a dog. shit on him.
then cry for him when he's gone.

600
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.040
I'm not oiling your gear.
Carry on creaking!

601
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.640
How dare you speak to me like that!

602
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.640
Where's my shotgun? Butler!
Bring me a shotgun!

603
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:09.360
What shotgun? Mr. Hicabi.
people get along by talking! Oh. my God!

604
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.000
Darn it! Did you have to put me in turbo?

605
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.160
Come back!

606
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.160
(upbeat music)

607
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.360
(Mr. Hicabi shrieks)

608
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.040
-(yells)
-(rifle fires)

609
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.320
No! The bastard wrecked my gear!
Take me inside. butler!

610
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.280
-Hey. what's up?
-Fuck!

611
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.480
Hey. calm down! Calm down! Pull over.

612
00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.000
-Where the fuck did you come from?
-Pull over! You'll crash the car.

613
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.720
Don't get in.
You're soaked. Get over there.

614
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960
Okay.

615
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.120
Why are you here?

616
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.800
I farted in the pool. sorry.

617
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.240
-Your dad-in-law nearly blasted me.
-I won't lie. I wanted him to.

618
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.080
Are you crazy? This is no joke!

619
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.560
I was planning this for three months.

620
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.520
When you turned up. I thought.
"two birds with one stone."

621
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.840
My dad-in-law goes
for two buttocks with one shot.

622
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.840
Just see how I go for you
when I take you back.

623
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.080
It's kind of tricky for me to go back.

624
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.840
So what are you gonna do?

625
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.600
I have an army buddy. A beekeeper.

626
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.240
A real army buddy?

627
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.840
-A real army buddy?
-(imitates mockingly)

628
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.840
We'll make honey. The brand and the name
are all set. "Lick!"

629
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.440
Lick?

630
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.120
Yes. Our slogan is "Hold the honey jar.
lick your fingers."

631
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.640
Ace idea! You're jealous. as always.

632
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.280
Let's go back. You'll go hungry.

633
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.200
I ran away because. like you.
they had no faith in me.

634
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.240
Now give me some cash to get on my way.

635
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.000
Why should I give you cash?

636
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.600
You seem to forget you owe me.

637
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.040
I don't owe you anything. I nearly got
shot in the ass. We're square.

638
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.560
We're not.
Your ass is still rosy-cheeked.

639
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.720
This is my curse. I can't help it.

640
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.880
I'll give you cash on one condition.

641
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960
What's that?

642
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.960
We call Grandpa. You say you forgive me.

643
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.080
But I don't.

644
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.920
So what? Just lie.
Otherwise. no cash. Up to you.

645
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.080
Let me get changed.
We'll talk more in the car.

646
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.800
Oh? Says he's been planning it for months
and leaves with no cash!

647
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880
(spits)

648
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.520
-Are you dry?
-Yes! I am.

649
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.280
-I'm calling Grandpa.
-Go for it.

650
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.560
(Mr. Yüksel panting)

651
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.560
<i>What's up. son?</i>

652
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.280
What happened? What's up with you?

653
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.680
Don't ask! There's a new manager.

654
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.120
He wants us to exercise every morning.
I tell you. I'm done in.

655
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.520
<i>Look who's with me.</i>

656
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.360
-<i>Grandpa!</i>
-Koray! Don't tell me you made up?

657
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.840
We made up. Grandpa. I have forgiven him.
Plus. I really missed him.

658
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.800
Me too. I missed him so bad
I want to pull out his mustache!

659
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.040
Okay! Don't overdo it.

660
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.280
<i>Attaboys! So. Erkin.</i>
<i>You pulled off this one.</i>

661
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.000
-<i>Let's see how you do with the other.</i>
-The other?

662
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.040
<i>Koala! I'm out of the shower.</i>

663
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.040
Your turn now.

664
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.120
Oh!

665
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.760
<i>No way. Grandpa!</i>

666
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.520
<i>Grandpa.</i>
<i>what are you making us think? Stop.</i>

667
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.720
Zip it! Can't we unrest
the rest home a little?

668
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.600
(chuckles)

669
00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.240
<i>What the hell is "koala"?</i>

670
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.600
In my wild days. they called me panther.

671
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.120
Now I cling on and don't let go.
That makes me a koala.

672
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.120
(phone beeps)

673
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.920
Ah. Grandpa!

674
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.880
Okay. I delivered. Give me the cash.

675
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.640
-Bro!
-What?

676
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.480
I'm off to say sorry to Merve now.

677
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.200
Come with me. then I promise
I'll take you wherever you want.

678
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.800
What would I do there?

679
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.800
Plus. if Merve sees you forgave me.
she might come around more quickly.

680
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.760
-I'm not sticking up for you.
-Okay. don't.

681
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.280
Here's my offer.

682
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.440
Grandpa's giving me 180. okay? I'll ask
for 250. I know he has money. You get 70.

683
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.880
-I get 70?
-Seventy. Net.

684
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.520
(clears throat)

685
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.480
How about it?

686
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.320
Okay. Let's not keep your ex waiting.

687
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400
Awesome!

688
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.480
-Say sorry and we're out of there. Okay?
-Okay.

689
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.120
-Seventy?
-Seventy.

690
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.400
-Deal.
-Whatever you say. koala.

691
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.160
KORAY: What the hell is koala?

692
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.120
(upbeat music)

693
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.800
You're sure Merve's here?

694
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.800
I guess. Her mom posted a story here.

695
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.560
Why are you still following her mom?

696
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.720
Once I follow someone. I can't stop.
I even follow our dead relatives.

697
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.920
Like who?

698
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.880
Uncle Cemal.
Once a week. I DM him a fire emoji.

699
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.560
Why DM someone dead?

700
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.320
I hung out with him a lot once.

701
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.880
We did a lot of bad stuff.

702
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.720
So it's like a joke.
"You burn in hell. I'm on my way."

703
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.280
Shame on you! Looks like this place...
Wait. I'll take a look.

704
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.680
-So where are they?
-MERVE: Mom. let's go downstairs

705
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.600
-and check in the mirror there.
-ŞÜKRAN: Sure.

706
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.880
It's bigger.

707
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.640
-Mom. it's gorgeous!
-You look gorgeous.

708
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.080
-MERVE: What do you think?
-Man. I'm a nervous wreck!

709
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.440
-Okay...
-(Erkin panting)

710
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.160
...close your eyes. and take deep breaths.

711
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.240
-What?
-Trust me.

712
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.600
-Close your eyes. take deep breaths.
-Okay.

713
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.960
Don't open those eyes.

714
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.440
What are you doing?

715
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.440
-Can't I have any fun?
-Moron!

716
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.280
Just like a young me!

717
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.800
-You don't look so alike.
-Just like a young me!

718
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.120
Just like it.

719
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.840
-ŞÜKRAN: Just like it.
-Okay.

720
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.200
Mom. it's three days to the wedding.

721
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.840
MERVE: I can't wait!

722
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.920
(whispering)
Three days till she marries.

723
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.040
We crashed the wedding!

724
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.000
I'm not saying sorry. She can't see me.

725
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.560
ŞÜKRAN: If only your dad was here.

726
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.440
Don't worry. he'll be watching up there.

727
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.280
Of course he will. The dog!

728
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.240
Gazing around instead of flying his plane.

729
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.120
Who knows who he's sleeping with?

730
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.440
He's coming to the wedding.

731
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:47.520
Really? So for the very first time.
he'll be there for you on a big day?

732
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.160
Is he coming alone?

733
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.160
-What do you think?
-No! He'll have found some hooker.

734
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.600
Mom! Don't talk like that
about people you don't know.

735
00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.680
Merve. look. I'm your mom.

736
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.520
Anyone with your dad who isn't me.
you call them a hooker.

737
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.440
-Mom!
-Go on. say it.

738
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.560
It's easy. Hoo-ker. Two syllables. Say it.

739
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.960
Sex worker.

740
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.440
Okay. Okay. that works too.

741
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.440
Merve. don't laugh.

742
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.000
If he turns up one day
with your sibling from another woman.

743
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.560
I'll be the one laughing!

744
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.240
Let's get out of here.

745
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.360
SHOP OWNER: This fits fine.
Now try the other.

746
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.880
-MERVE: Okay. I can't wait to see it on.
-No! They're coming!

747
00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.120
-Oh? Did you see who went in?
-No.

748
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.280
Ms. Zeliha. is it you?

749
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.600
They are calling us. What do we do?

750
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.000
SHOP OWNER: Ms. Zeliha. is it you?

751
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.920
(in high voice)
Yeah.

752
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.480
Okay. your dress is hanging on the right.
You can try it on.

753
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.440
-What do we do?
-We have to get out. Put on the dress.

754
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.600
-The dress?
-Yes.

755
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.480
-Screw you!
-Get it on!

756
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.480
No way!

757
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.320
If you don't want her to see you...

758
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.720
I am not doing it!

759
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.560
Fine.

760
00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.960
Zeliha!
Come on. I can't wait to see your dress.

761
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.240
Isn't it bad luck if we see it?

762
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.840
-No. That's if the groom sees it.
-(chuckles)

763
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.600
Darling. how would he see?
He's off-the-scale myopic!

764
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.160
Mom. stop! She's in there.

765
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.240
(laughs)
What happened. girl?

766
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.400
Wait a second. Mom.

767
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.000
Erkin?

768
00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.360
(panting)

769
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.400
So you're finally getting married.

770
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.600
Finally?

771
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.680
-Son. what is this?
-Don't say "son"!

772
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760
What am I supposed to say?

773
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.840
Son of a sex worker!

774
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.600
Listen to me!
You're stepping on my skirt! Stop!

775
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.040
-MERVE: Why are you here?
-Merve. please!

776
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.040
MERVE: Drop dead!

777
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.680
-I want to say something.
-Don't bother. I don't want to hear.

778
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.360
-How's it going?
-ŞÜKRAN: How are you. sugar?

779
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.120
-Good. how are you?
-I am doing good. Do something about them.

780
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.160
MERVE: What are you doing here?
Why did you come?

781
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.280
I'll kill you. Die.

782
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.360
-I can't breathe.
-Don't breathe! Die!

783
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.240
You need to press here on his jugular.
You are doing it wrong.

784
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.840
-I came to make up. not to make trouble.
-MERVE: What are you doing here?

785
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.000
Why did you come. huh?

786
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.040
Die! I don't care.
I'm not listening. okay?

787
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.280
ERKIN: Oh. shit! We've been busted.

788
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.720
What's going on here?

789
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.240
Who are you?

790
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.200
The husband-to-be of the bride
on top of you.

791
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.040
Who are you?

792
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.160
He's the bride
underneath the bride on top.

793
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.040
Merve!

794
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.480
Can you explain. sweetie?

795
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.440
Honey.

796
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.920
-Erkin's a very old friend of mine.
-Yes.

797
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.720
And... So is Koray.

798
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.960
MERVE: We...

799
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.240
They came for the wedding. A surprise.

800
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.120
I didn't know. We were goofing around.

801
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.440
I was wrestling him for a laugh.
Just a laugh.

802
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.000
A laugh.

803
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.480
A laugh? Fuck the goofing around!

804
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.400
Poyraz. what's going on?

805
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.800
That... is what anyone else
in my place would say.

806
00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.040
But I'm not saying that.

807
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.840
Because I'm trying to be a good person.

808
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.160
-Right. sweetie?
-Breathe in and out. We'll be back.

809
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.000
-Let's talk out there. Move your head.
-I'm a good person. right. honey?

810
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.120
-Pull me up! Don't step on my skirt.
-KORAY: Here you go.

811
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.920
-Come here. give me that skirt.
-Don't step on my skirt! Hold it up!

812
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.520
ŞÜKRAN: Son. what are you doing?

813
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.160
Ms. Şükran.
Seriously. I don't mean any harm.

814
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.680
-Fine. but...
-I came to do something.

815
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.320
KORAY: What are they up to?
What kind of a fight is this?

816
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.680
-They're a bit on edge.
-Oh. my God.

817
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.120
-KORAY: They're fighting again?
-Is the guy crazy?

818
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.840
-A bit moody. Stay calm.
-KORAY: Are you okay?

819
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.760
They're fighting again.

820
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.160
-ERKIN: What the heck?
-ŞÜKRAN: Okay.

821
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.440
Sorry about that.
It wasn't the greatest start. but...

822
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.760
-ERKIN: Yeah.
-I'm Poyraz. Welcome.

823
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.160
Thanks.

824
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.200
He says thanks.

825
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.960
By the way.
I'm so happy you're Merve's witness.

826
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.960
Witness?

827
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.840
For the wedding or for some court case?

828
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.840
No. for the wedding. Thanks so much.

829
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.120
So how about we have dinner
all together tonight?

830
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.200
What did you say?

831
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.360
All together?

832
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.600
Sure. Mom. At our place. We'll fix it.

833
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.920
Okay. whatever you want. honey.
Right. we'll eat together tonight.

834
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.960
I have a boat tour now.
so I'll see you tonight. Okay?

835
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.960
-See you.
-Bye. Off you go.

836
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.680
(mouths)
What the heck?

837
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.400
You're okay in that outfit.
You can wear it to dinner.

838
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.200
It's really bad luck
for the groom to see the dress.

839
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.280
MERVE: You are the bad luck!

840
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.640
What am I gonna do now?
Poyraz saw me in this. I can't wear it!

841
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.840
Swap?

842
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.960
-Swap?
-What?

843
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.720
That dress sucks. Doesn't suit you either.

844
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.920
Really? I'll tell Züleyha.

845
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.280
MERVE: It's Zeliha. moron.

846
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.480
Fine. Zeliha or Züleyha. no problem.

847
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.880
What's the girl gonna do now?

848
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.440
ERKIN: Aren't we gonna discuss
Zeliha's size?

849
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.280
What did you say to calm him down?

850
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.240
Forget that. Tell me why you're here.
Why did you come here?

851
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.240
Merve. I'm here to say sorry.

852
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.000
Not because I expect anything.
But I can't live with this guilt.

853
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.800
I even said sorry to Koray.

854
00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.080
Erkin. please! Tell the truth.

855
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.480
Our grandpa said he'd pay off his debts
if he said sorry to you and me.

856
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.760
(exclaims)

857
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.320
That's you! That's just your style.

858
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.440
So what did you tell him?

859
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.160
Nothing major. I said you're my brother.

860
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.000
Merve. what's with the "brother"?
What kind of nonsense is that?

861
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.280
Erkin!

862
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.360
Poyraz is a really decent. civilized guy.

863
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.920
Okay. he may have an anger issue.
but he's having therapy for that.

864
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.720
I won't do anything to hurt him. okay?

865
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.880
Good friend wouldn't work.
I couldn't say ex-fiancé. What was left?

866
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.160
Didn't he ask why he didn't know
about me before?

867
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.960
Here's how I fixed that.

868
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.680
I told him you're my dad's son
from another woman.

869
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.240
Having the same dad makes us siblings.

870
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.920
Right. What did your mom say?

871
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.600
She didn't like it. of course.
but there is nothing she can do.

872
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.200
So what am I?

873
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.920
Erkin's cousin on his mother's side.
Two brothers in one day were too much.

874
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.600
Right. So I'm a cousin.

875
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.880
-Exactly.
-Okay.

876
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.600
As if "brother" and "cousin"
wasn't enough.

877
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.280
you told him I was a witness!

878
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.520
(snickers)

879
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.320
I did that for a kick.

880
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.320
ERKIN: Why?

881
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.160
Because I got hurt. I hurt for ages.
I want you to hurt too.

882
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.080
I don't care.
You keep up the lie till the wedding.

883
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.360
or I won't forgive you.
and you won't pay your debt.

884
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.560
Merve. I get it. You and I...

885
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.960
You and I?

886
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.160
After everything that happened.
I'm asking you for one thing. Erkin.

887
00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.640
You can't not value me
enough not to do it.

888
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.600
Listen...

889
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.120
Be there on time tonight.
Okay? Don't be late.

890
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.720
Bro.

891
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.120
(Merve giggles)

892
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.600
What do we do now?

893
00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:01.480
Not my problem. I came here with you.
lied to grandpa. and found Merve for you.

894
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.920
So where's my cash? I am going.

895
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.000
After everything that happened between us.
I asked you for one thing.

896
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.800
You can't not value me enough
not to do it.

897
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:19.520
Where do you learn fancy lines like that?
How do you come up with them? Let's go.

898
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.120
-When we go to the dinner...
-Just walk.

899
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.400
First...

900
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280
(spits)

901
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.680
Want some seeds? You like them.

902
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.480
Screw the seeds. stop stalling
and hand over the cash. I'm off.

903
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.080
Koray. Bro.

904
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.000
Look. I have nothing to do here.
Give me my cash. I'm off.

905
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.880
-Listen...
-Give me my cash!

906
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.080
Okay. but my wallet's in the car.

907
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.200
CANAN: Koray?

908
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.000
KORAY: Canan?

909
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.280
What are you doing here?

910
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.720
I came for Merve's wedding.
We still see each other.

911
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.960
In fact. I set her up with Poyraz.
I introduced them.

912
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.280
He's a childhood friend.

913
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.680
Really? That's great.

914
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.880
CANAN: Yes.

915
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.920
But what are you guys doing here?

916
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.840
We... Erkin got the urge to say sorry
to people he's messed around with.

917
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.120
First. he said sorry to me. then Merve.

918
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.800
You can be the next if you want.
Say sorry.

919
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.040
-Say it.
-Go on. It won't kill you.

920
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.520
Please. just one.

921
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.480
-Sorry.
-Excuse me?

922
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.760
Now without the seeds.

923
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.800
-Sorry.
-Okay. fine.

924
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.960
The case against you lapsed anyway.

925
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.160
So you're not staying for the wedding?

926
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.800
No. we are. We'll be there.

927
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.320
We have to clear up a misunderstanding.

928
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.080
-Merve will explain.
-CANAN: Okay.

929
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.200
Wow! I'm happy to see you
after all these years. you know?

930
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.320
Me too.

931
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.320
CANAN: Really?

932
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.840
I'll be off then.

933
00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.840
Okay.

934
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.560
Bye.

935
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.360
Bye. See you.

936
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.000
See you!

937
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.760
Go on. go.

938
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:05.000
After everything that happened between us.
you asked me for one thing.

939
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.160
I can't not value you enough not to do it.

940
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.760
Get in the car.

941
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.760
Sweetie. pepper.

942
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.120
POYRAZ: Thank you.

943
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.840
Like the food. bro-in-law?

944
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.400
It's great. bro.

945
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.960
(clears throat)

946
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.320
-Sis...
-Bro-in-law.

947
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.960
-Bro-in-law.
-Enjoy.

948
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.160
Want a stuffed vine leaf... Bro?

949
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.320
Sure. Thanks. sis.

950
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.880
So what am I to you?

951
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.120
Absolutely nothing. sweet pea.

952
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.480
-Sweet pea? Nice. I'll pocket that.
-Really?

953
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.640
Now we're all here.
let's see that first dance.

954
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.120
-(groans)
-POYRAZ: Seyyal.

955
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.400
Look. we have guests.

956
00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.000
Oh. yes. you said.
Sorry. it took a while to get ready.

957
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.200
We just got here too.

958
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.560
So we came together. I'm Seyyal.

959
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.160
And I'm Erkin.

960
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.600
MERVE: Seyyal is Poyraz's aunt.

961
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.000
Your mom is your aunt.

962
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.520
-Oh. really? Why am I the aunt?
-Aunt?

963
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.960
What can I do? Your daughter winds me up.

964
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.560
(smooches)

965
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.800
(mutters)

966
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.280
Someone here goes to the gym.
Check out that six-pack.

967
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.920
(Merve snickers)

968
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.680
What six-pack? It's just the way I am.

969
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.360
I don't believe it.

970
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.920
Believe what? A kick up the butt.
and his whole body wobbles.

971
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.480
Forget six-packs!

972
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.680
What's going on?

973
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.520
What? If it's you and me.
I should get picked. Why you?

974
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.400
Don't be jealous of my six-packs. baby.

975
00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.960
-Face front!
-Zip it!

976
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.360
Okay!
Stop drinking and let's see you dance!

977
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.160
Come on. sweetie. Don't play coy.

978
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.760
-(overlapping chatter)
-Give it to us! First dance!

979
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.760
Come on.

980
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.080
-No. I'm eating.
-SEYYAL: Come on!

981
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.320
Give them a break. They're eating.

982
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.680
If they want to later. really want to.
they'll give us a dance.

983
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:10.920
Get up. honey. We're dancing. Come on!
As you're dying to see. let's show you.

984
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.200
Let's see it.

985
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.200
(Poyraz grumbling)

986
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.880
-Let's see what he's made of.
-Zip it!

987
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.520
We have to be prepared!

988
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.880
MERVE: Music!

989
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.880
(gentle dance music)

990
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.160
(upbeat music)

991
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.080
(relaxing music)

992
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.960
(upbeat music)

993
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.360
(upbeat percussive music)

994
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.000
Hey!

995
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.200
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

996
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.760
ŞÜKRAN: Bravo!

997
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.480
MERVE: Thanks.

998
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.000
Seeing that happy look in Merve's eyes.
that does it for me.

999
00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.680
Even if she doesn't talk about it much...

1000
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.040
Merve was all torn up
by her previous relationship.

1001
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.640
POYRAZ: She was badly hurt.

1002
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.880
If I have helped
to heal those wounds this much...

1003
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.160
I'm a happy guy.

1004
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.800
CANAN: Whatever. let's drop the bad stuff.

1005
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.960
That was such a hideous time.
but it's history now.

1006
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.600
Let's not call it all hideous. sweet pea.

1007
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.000
Whoops!
Sweet pea's out of my pocket. Here.

1008
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.160
Caught it.

1009
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.560
Oof. okay! Whatever. Can we forget him?

1010
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.440
-Fuck your mom!
-What?

1011
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.720
Fuck that guy's name and his mom!

1012
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.240
-Honey. those meds...
-However he hurt her...

1013
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.080
But I'm here now.
You won't get hurt again. sweetie.

1014
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.560
So. how did you like the dance. six-pack?

1015
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.600
It was great.
but not a lot like a first dance.

1016
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680
SEYYAL: Yeah?

1017
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.560
More like an entry
for a folk dance competition.

1018
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.680
Okay. We wanted it to be playful.

1019
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.960
-Really?
-So you know what you're talking about?

1020
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.680
Sure. Aged 16. we won
the dance championship in Erdek.

1021
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.880
What?
(laughing)

1022
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.400
With him?

1023
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.720
Yes. with him.

1024
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.280
Come on. Koray!

1025
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.400
-What?
-Let's dance!

1026
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.720
-Sit down!
-Come on!

1027
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.800
-What dance?
-Come on!

1028
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.000
-And prove what?
-Come on!

1029
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.720
-Sit down.
-I'm getting up.

1030
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.240
-Come on!
-POYRAZ: Give it to us!

1031
00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.200
-So let's see it.
-Give it to us!

1032
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.160
Guys. stop! Hey! I'm not gonna dance.

1033
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.440
You can't. anyway. You dance?

1034
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.360
You can't even clap properly.
Sorry. but...

1035
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.480
(women laughing)

1036
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.840
CANAN: You dance?

1037
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.120
Can you hold this?

1038
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.040
-What?
-Let's see.

1039
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.200
(ballroom dance music)

1040
00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.880
(clanking)

1041
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.200
Should we maybe have coffee inside?

1042
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.240
See what my grounds say?

1043
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.880
What?

1044
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.040
E.

1045
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.800
E?

1046
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.920
E.

1047
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.920
-I see.
-MERVE: I'm wiped out.

1048
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.960
(sighs)

1049
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.880
Mom finally fell asleep.

1050
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960
Honey.

1051
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:35.800
Tomorrow night there's the henna do.
There's the stag night.

1052
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.000
I say. tomorrow morning.
I come to pick you up in the boat.

1053
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.480
we go for a five-star cruise.

1054
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.800
and we let it all hang out
and blow off some steam.

1055
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.840
How about it?

1056
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.400
Who could say no? Give me a five. bud!

1057
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.800
-You got it!
-But sweetie...

1058
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.760
Honey. please. No is not an option.

1059
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.640
(Merve sighs)

1060
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.920
Where are you guys staying?

1061
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.560
We're yet to find a place.

1062
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.720
SEYYAL: Really?

1063
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:07.560
Come stay here. It's your sister's home.
The place is yours!

1064
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.120
No. I mean. they're fine.
They'll figure it out. Never mind.

1065
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.800
We'll figure it out.

1066
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.240
But then we're kind of blitzed.
I think we're best off staying here.

1067
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.360
I think so too.

1068
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.040
Yeah. The thing is...

1069
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:25.400
No. there isn't room for them.
Seriously. the house is too small.

1070
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.960
What's the deal. honey?
Seyyal can come with me.

1071
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.960
Aren't you staying with Merve?

1072
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.280
See? The guy's a true bro. No. bro-in-law.
I'm not staying here.

1073
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.440
(mutters)

1074
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:41.400
Sorry. Poyraz.
I can't stay in that poky place of yours.

1075
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:48.120
Also. you drank so much you're bound
to snore. But I could share with Erkin.

1076
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:53.000
Trust me.
I snore a lot. too. after drinking.

1077
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.280
-Really? Okay.
-So it's best if I share with Koray.

1078
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.560
No way can I sleep with you. bro.
I'd sleep with anyone but you.

1079
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.760
For example...

1080
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.880
thinking out loud.
it's all hypothetical. of course...

1081
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.040
I could even share with Canan.

1082
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.960
You can't. I stay at a hotel.
How will you share with me?

1083
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.360
I'd stay in the hotel.

1084
00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.920
-Really?
-I'll walk you back. bud.

1085
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Let's do it. I am going. I need sleep.

1086
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.440
No need. She can walk herself. It's close.

1087
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.720
So what are we doing?

1088
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.760
Here's what. You share with Merve.

1089
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.840
Me?

1090
00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.520
Sweetie. there's really no need.

1091
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.480
Honey. it's settled.

1092
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.480
Now your siblings have found each other.

1093
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.960
you can natter all night
like you did as kids.

1094
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.520
What more do you want. honey?

1095
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.480
Fantastic idea. bro-in-law!
I missed you. sis.

1096
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.640
How cool to be brother and sister
together like in the old days.

1097
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.760
Brother and sister.

1098
00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.000
-Brother and sister. Hey. bro!
-Sis!

1099
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.560
And then you two can share.

1100
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.000
There's really no need.

1101
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.280
-I agree. No need at all.
-(awkward chuckle)

1102
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.120
What the heck?

1103
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.800
-Problem solved. You two can share.
-Okay. you...

1104
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.360
Poyraz's idea was great.

1105
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.000
-But Canan...
-(overlapping chatter)

1106
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.160
-We're all set. bro-in-law.
-ERKIN: Bro.

1107
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.960
Hey. enough!

1108
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.440
I'll share with Seyyal.
you two sleep together. All done.

1109
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.320
But Merve. my coffee grounds said E.

1110
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.320
There's an E in Merve. Two. in fact.

1111
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.320
Come on. bedtime. Good night.

1112
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.400
-I'll get your beds ready.
-SEYYAL: Good night.

1113
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.000
MERVE: Honey. good night.

1114
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.960
Good night. Okay. I'm off to my hotel.

1115
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.280
Canan! Canan!

1116
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.000
Canan what? I'm going.

1117
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.480
Bro! Bro.

1118
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.600
She could've stayed.

1119
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.040
What's up? I'm stuck with you again.

1120
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.200
I'm stuck with you. jerk.

1121
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.240
-Bro.
-What?

1122
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.800
Your girls totally left. I'm still here.
Your bro's in the game!

1123
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.000
(tongue clucks)

1124
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.960
I can't stop eating.

1125
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.520
I'm off to the bathroom.
I'm gonna run a bath and chill.

1126
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.360
-Go for it.
-See you later.

1127
01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.160
(door closes)

1128
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240
(playful music)

1129
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.200
-(door closes)
-What happened? Forget something? Erkin?

1130
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.000
What are you doing? Get out. will you?

1131
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.840
What? I'm not allowed in my sister's room?

1132
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.400
Spare me! Get out.
Seyyal will be here any second.

1133
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.080
Hey. slow down.

1134
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.480
(water burbles)

1135
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.200
Wait. It's a water bed?

1136
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.760
(laughing)

1137
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.560
Awesome!

1138
01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.160
ERKIN: Check that out!

1139
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.920
(cheering)

1140
01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.160
It makes you all shifty.

1141
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.360
ERKIN: Tell you what.

1142
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.560
Our bodies are 75 percent water.

1143
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.280
Say the bed is 25 percent.
Result? 100 percent perfection.

1144
01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.640
(chuckles)

1145
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.960
That's really funny.
Erkin. get out or you're in trouble.

1146
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.880
No shit! We're having
a brotherly and sisterly chat.

1147
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.840
You use this to cut fruit?

1148
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.000
-Erkin. come on. Come on!
-Psychopath.

1149
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.000
Wait.

1150
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.520
(dramatic music)

1151
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.920
Wasn't this my Valentine's gift?

1152
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.440
I don't know. No idea.

1153
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.200
Yeah. right.
But you kept it all this time.

1154
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.960
-Okay. I have a question for you.
-Yeah.

1155
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.160
Who in God's name gives their lover
a betting coupon for Valentine's?

1156
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920
You're right.

1157
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.560
It burned on the last pick.

1158
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.400
What a coincidence!
Just like our relationship.

1159
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.120
Look. I wrote a poem on the back.

1160
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200
"Spirited and majestic...

1161
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.320
wild and without limits.
I love you like a horse."

1162
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.240
Bull! You didn't love me so much
as a butterfly. forget horses.

1163
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.280
Out. Erkin. I'm going to bed.

1164
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.840
Merve.

1165
01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.080
For God's sake!

1166
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.040
Look.

1167
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.640
It really hit me when I saw you.

1168
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.800
I'm sorry from the heart.

1169
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.880
(scoffs)
Your heart's on the other side. moron.

1170
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.200
I'm sorry from the heart.

1171
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.200
So if your grandpa hadn't pushed you.
would you have come here?

1172
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.160
But I take my hat off to him. Bravo!
(claps)

1173
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.520
Why?

1174
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.560
There's still someone out there
who hasn't given up on you.

1175
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.080
Out. Erkin. I'm going to bed.

1176
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.080
-Another five minutes.
-Erkin!

1177
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.120
-Can't you listen for a second?
-Enough!

1178
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.360
(both scream)

1179
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.760
Merve! It's just exploded. Merve!

1180
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.520
-Oh. Erkin. stop it! God damn it! Erkin!
-What kind of bed is this?

1181
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.800
Merve! I have the balls to do this.
I will block it! Stop!

1182
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880
Okay. block it!

1183
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.280
Stop!

1184
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.320
(Merve mutters)

1185
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.560
Erkin!

1186
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.640
-What did we go through?
-What the heck?

1187
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.240
(lively music)

1188
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.320
I'm bored.

1189
01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.440
-How much longer?
-No idea.

1190
01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.960
Bro-in-law. clink!

1191
01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.840
-You got it.
-(Canan cheers)

1192
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.560
Cheers! Honey!

1193
01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.280
Look at him! Loudmouth.

1194
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.640
He acts so big.

1195
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.000
-Mom.
-MAN: Surprise!

1196
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.800
Dad?

1197
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.520
-ŞÜKRAN: Is that Haldun?
-CANAN: What?

1198
01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.440
-My dad.
-Your dad?

1199
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.920
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

1200
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.480
-Wait.
-Think of something.

1201
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.080
What do we do? Think of something.

1202
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.680
-One second. I'm thinking. Got it.
-What?

1203
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.600
You look that way. I'll look this way.

1204
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.760
That idea sucks!

1205
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.960
Look that way. Act like we're not here.

1206
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.480
-He's thinking. So am I.
-MERVE: What do we do?

1207
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.200
-No idea. The brother deal worked.
-Damn you for coming!

1208
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.000
Do you think I can be your brother
with this face? No!

1209
01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.200
For God's sake.

1210
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.840
-POYRAZ: Welcome!
-You're the groom?

1211
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.440
-That's me!
-Kiss my hand.

1212
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.880
-Sure. Dad.
-(chuckles)

1213
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.040
That's my boy. son-in-law! Merve.

1214
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.040
-Dad.
-(Haldun sighs)

1215
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.440
I was gonna come on the wedding day
but couldn't wait till then.

1216
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.640
I've been out of your life too long.
So where's my hug? Come on. girl!

1217
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.160
(scoffs)
Finally. you come to your senses!

1218
01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.280
-And a hug for you. Şüko.
-No. thanks.

1219
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.480
Dad. you gave us a surprise.
but now we have one for you.

1220
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.040
-Not now. sweetie.
-Honey. leave it to me.

1221
01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.320
-Erkin!
-Don't look!

1222
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.800
-KORAY: Don't look.
-Bro-in-law. what are you staring at?

1223
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.520
POYRAZ: Erkin! Look who's here!

1224
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360
(mutters)

1225
01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.400
So who are they?

1226
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480
You don't recognize them?

1227
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.000
Dad.

1228
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.720
Dad?

1229
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.400
His dad.

1230
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.760
His dad?

1231
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.000
Our dad.

1232
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.120
Our dad?

1233
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:44.000
Hey. Dad! Dad! Oh. Dad!

1234
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.440
Wait a second!

1235
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.000
So you're him?

1236
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.800
So you found each other
after all these years?

1237
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:55.920
Who?

1238
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920
Son?

1239
01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.480
Your son?

1240
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.520
-Son! Hey. son!
-Dad! Dad!

1241
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.520
Your son?

1242
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.560
Yes. my son!

1243
01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.840
I have a son I never met. Or had.

1244
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.040
I didn't even know his name.
His mom walked out years ago.

1245
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.040
My long lost son! So good to see you.

1246
01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.800
Oh. Dad!

1247
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.480
God damn you. Haldun!

1248
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.080
Calm down. It's okay.

1249
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.240
-Go rot in hell! God damn you!
-(indistinct shouts)

1250
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.640
MERVE: My mom could not accept
this siblings thing yet.

1251
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.160
-Is she okay?
-Fine. We gave her some of your meds.

1252
01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.080
ŞÜKRAN: God damn you. Haldun!

1253
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.080
(humming)

1254
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.280
Maybe she isn't.

1255
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.160
Anyway. I'm starving. What can we eat?

1256
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.240
Me too. I could even eat you. you know?

1257
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.760
Careful. I might stick in your throat.

1258
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.080
I'd swallow you. don't worry.

1259
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.360
Maniac!

1260
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.520
You bet.

1261
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.880
Don't worry. Koray.

1262
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.800
The planet's best fisherman is right here!
I'll hook them there. cook them here.

1263
01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.840
I'm not bad myself.

1264
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.160
No kidding. bro-in-law!

1265
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.560
I'll hook them there. you cook them here.

1266
01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.960
(laughter)

1267
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.480
Cool. Let's do it then?

1268
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.280
-Let's do it.
-POYRAZ: Let's do it.

1269
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.480
-Whoever hooks the most fish wins.
-Most fish.

1270
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.440
I have a spare tackle. You can use mine.

1271
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.760
-Your tackle? Okay.
-POYRAZ: Yeah.

1272
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.960
Erkin's good. but he doesn't eat meat.

1273
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:23.960
HALDUN: Look at them.

1274
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.480
How they've got to know each other.
I'm proud of my two kids.

1275
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.760
Right. Dad?

1276
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.320
My sis is the cutest thing in the world.
There. a kiss from me.

1277
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.960
(whispering)

1278
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.960
Moron! Dad. we need to talk at some point.

1279
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.560
I'm just going to the restroom.

1280
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.440
Go. bro. We're catching up here.
Dear sweet sister!

1281
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.760
-(mutters)
-Get off!

1282
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200
(Erkin sighs)

1283
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.040
<i>Koray. I've been trying</i>
<i>to reach you for days. honey.</i>

1284
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.920
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

1285
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.280
<i>Look. you left your allergy meds behind.</i>

1286
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.080
<i>I'd send them if I knew where you were.</i>

1287
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.320
<i>The girls really miss you too.</i>

1288
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.520
<i>Let me at least give you</i>
<i>a peek at each other.</i>

1289
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.600
(gentle music)

1290
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.320
CANAN: What's up?

1291
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.520
I'm good.

1292
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.360
I thought I'd come looking for you.

1293
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.600
Great.

1294
01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.600
Now I'm here.
can you rub some cream on my back?

1295
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.800
-Sure. no problem.
-Yeah?

1296
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.080
Right away.

1297
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.880
Pull your hair out of the way.

1298
01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.040
-Okay. great. Here goes.
-Here.

1299
01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.040
Okay.

1300
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.760
I guess I missed you.

1301
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840
Really?

1302
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920
Yes.

1303
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.200
Can I ask something?

1304
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.400
Ask away.

1305
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.720
What did you miss most about me?

1306
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520
You want me to be honest?

1307
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.840
Please.

1308
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.480
I don't know...

1309
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:49.960
to be perfectly honest. no one
has ever oiled me as well as you do.

1310
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.320
-Oiled you?
-Yes.

1311
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.800
Not that I'd want
to be remembered for that. but...

1312
01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.040
Okay. I'll take it.
Then let me do what I'm best at. Right?

1313
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.880
Then I'll get in position.

1314
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.480
Should I stay with the back or carry on?

1315
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.120
Go where your heart takes you.

1316
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.000
-My heart?
-Yes.

1317
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.240
If only it was just my heart.

1318
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.560
(Koray clears throat)

1319
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.600
Okay. let's keep going.

1320
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.880
-Except...
-Great.

1321
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.560
-Canan. I have a question.
-Ask away.

1322
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.120
Does the cream have coconut in it?

1323
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.800
Smells heavenly. right?

1324
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.800
But you know I have an allergy to coconut.

1325
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.080
No. I don't.

1326
01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.320
But we were about to get married.
How could you forget?

1327
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.480
I forgot. Do I have to remember
every detail about you?

1328
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.960
But we were together so long!
How can you not remember?

1329
01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.880
-Koray. you have to help me!
-We're talking here.

1330
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.280
But I said I'd hook a ton of fish.

1331
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.080
-I challenged him! Help me!
-Wait.

1332
01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.880
-Did you ask me first? Back off!
-Come on!

1333
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.680
We're talking.

1334
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.480
-So there's stuff Canan doesn't know.
-What?

1335
01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.800
What does she know?
She even forgot about our allergy.

1336
01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880
What allergy?

1337
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.320
There's coconut in this.
The drama it's caused!

1338
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.600
Coconut?

1339
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.080
-CANAN: For God's sake.
-I wish I hadn't touched you.

1340
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.280
-I'm a wreck.
-Don't scratch. That spreads it.

1341
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.400
-Too late.
-Don't scratch.

1342
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.240
-Don't scratch. Come here.
-I'm a wreck. And do what?

1343
01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.880
-What? Like this?
-Like this.

1344
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.040
Like this?

1345
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.160
Move around to the back.

1346
01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.600
-No! It's moving down!
-What the heck are you doing?

1347
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680
Wait!

1348
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.680
(upbeat music)

1349
01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.160
God.

1350
01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.560
ERKIN: It's bad!

1351
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.680
I can't take this.

1352
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.160
Out of the way. Don't touch me.

1353
01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.720
You created this drama.
It's your fault. It's your fault.

1354
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.720
CANAN: I wish I'd never come.
I so regret it.

1355
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.880
Like this...

1356
01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.200
Bro. we need meds.

1357
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.680
Okay. we will buy meds.

1358
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.840
Bro. don't do that. Don't.

1359
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.960
Right!

1360
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.760
Whoever hooks the most fish wins.

1361
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.920
You get points based on fish size.
One. three. or five. Ready?

1362
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.520
-Ready. honey.
-Ready.

1363
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.880
Go!

1364
01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.280
Good luck. bro-in-law!

1365
01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.280
Let's go. Wait a second.

1366
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.680
KORAY: I am pulling.

1367
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.000
-Dash it.
-POYRAZ: What point this one gets?

1368
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.640
Okay...
(laughs)

1369
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.800
It is not over yet.

1370
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.360
ERKIN: Here it comes.

1371
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.360
This is it!

1372
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.480
POYRAZ: Honey. look what I got.

1373
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.040
Five.

1374
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.400
This is one big fish.

1375
01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.120
-Really. bro-in-law?
-ERKIN: Look at this.

1376
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.560
-Help me. Koray.
-Are you pulling?

1377
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.840
Yes. but you need to help me.

1378
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.600
KORAY: Give it to me.

1379
01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.360
This game is over. I am the winner.

1380
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.520
We will see.

1381
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.080
You should know your league.
I have been doing this for years.

1382
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.120
-You are all talk.
-KORAY: Here it comes!

1383
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.720
-Oh. shit!
-Erkin.

1384
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.480
What's up? You're giving up?

1385
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.800
Bro-in-law. you got hit by a pufferfish.
They're poisonous!

1386
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
HALDUN: Son!

1387
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.080
A pufferfish? So what do we do?

1388
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.880
We need ammonia.
Is there any in the boat? I will bring it.

1389
01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960
-No!
-There has to be an alternative. no?

1390
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.960
Piss.

1391
01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.360
What?

1392
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.400
Someone has to piss on the sting.

1393
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.520
No way! Not if it kills me.

1394
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.360
-It will kill you!
-Don't be insane! Let them spray you.

1395
01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.480
But I can't lose my son so soon.

1396
01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.760
Dad. now's not the time.

1397
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.240
This is not okay! Piss?

1398
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.160
-Sit down. Breathe.
-My head's spinning. I feel terrible.

1399
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.360
Breathe. His face is grim.

1400
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.520
Is it? Where?

1401
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.840
-It's swelling up.
-It's swelling up.

1402
01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.600
-Sit. We'll handle it.
-ERKIN: It's making my head spin.

1403
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.960
KORAY: Sit down.

1404
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.240
Koray. you do it.

1405
01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.600
I can't. I just took a leak.

1406
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.280
Someone do something! Look at me!

1407
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.960
-I would. but I have prostate issues.
-For God...

1408
01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.880
Come on! Someone do something!

1409
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.480
-Exactly! Come on!
-Come on. man. Do it!

1410
01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.640
-ERKIN: Come on. bro!
-It is...

1411
01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.600
-Come on. Mom!
-I'm on it. bro-in-law!

1412
01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.080
No! Not like that! Not li...

1413
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.040
I can't abandon my bro. His face is grim.

1414
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.360
Hey!

1415
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.280
I'm doing everything...

1416
01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.520
to squeeze it out.

1417
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.640
Shut your mouth.

1418
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.920
HALDUN: Go. go.

1419
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.200
(gentle music)

1420
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.480
CANAN: Let us know when it is over.

1421
01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.760
Okay. done!

1422
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.960
POYRAZ: All done. honey!

1423
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.600
-ŞÜKRAN: Let's hope that works.
-HALDUN: It has stopped.

1424
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.040
It's clearing up!

1425
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:51.960
He looks better.

1426
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.280
Are you okay?

1427
01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.840
Three seconds from dying. was I?

1428
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.360
You could've pissed in a pot
and let me handle it!

1429
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.360
I'd choose death over going through that!
Turn around. You faced front long enough.

1430
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.280
Dad! Look at you! Five points!

1431
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.600
HALDUN: Hey.

1432
01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.640
The biggest fish was on the boat!
We didn't stand a chance.

1433
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.800
HALDUN: Hey!

1434
01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:25.120
I don't want you getting too close.
You're armed!

1435
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.920
HALDUN: God give me strength!

1436
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.240
Is that carrying or possession?

1437
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.640
-HALDUN: Son!
-Carrying or possession?

1438
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.600
I mean the best boat is my friend's boat.

1439
01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.960
Bravo. Exactly.

1440
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.200
POYRAZ'S FRIEND: Still...

1441
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.880
POYRAZ: What is this? Who did this?

1442
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.440
Is this your funeral?

1443
01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.760
Ozi. is this your doing?

1444
01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.160
Don't you have anything better to do?

1445
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.200
(indistinct chatter)

1446
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.280
(solemn music)

1447
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
(upbeat music)

1448
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:29.880
<i>♪ Don't let them build homes
On high hills ♪</i>

1449
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:37.680
<i>♪ Don't let them bride their girls</i>
<i>To faraway lands ♪</i>

1450
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.040
Wait. What is going on?

1451
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.560
What? Is that an ambulance?

1452
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.120
There is someone in critical condition
here. right? We need to treat them.

1453
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.080
Who? We are in the middle
of henna do here.

1454
01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.400
No. we are sure. They are here.
We need to treat them immediately.

1455
01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.680
What are you talking about?

1456
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.040
Like this.

1457
01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.440
What the heck is happening?

1458
01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.600
(upbeat dance music)

1459
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.480
(women screaming. laughing)

1460
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.080
SEYYAL: Let's go!

1461
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.200
(dance music)

1462
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.920
Hey.

1463
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.960
-Is this your doing?
-Of course. darling.

1464
01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.400
-No!
-I don't believe you!

1465
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.400
Okay. I'm in a funk.
But what happened to you?

1466
01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.000
Bro. what are we doing here?

1467
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.400
I don't know.

1468
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.200
I'm sick of it.

1469
01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.040
Me too.

1470
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.920
(exhales)

1471
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560
(faint dance music playing)

1472
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.240
(Erkin exhales)

1473
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.640
What's up? You look spaced out.

1474
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.960
Given up on marriage. have you?

1475
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.200
Get out of here! As if.

1476
01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.480
(Poyraz chuckles)

1477
01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.520
I guess I'm a bit mixed up.

1478
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.120
But it's not the kind of stuff
I'd discuss with you. bro-in-law.

1479
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.920
What's it about?

1480
01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.880
(exhales)

1481
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.080
Merve.

1482
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.760
Merve?

1483
01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840
Yeah.

1484
01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.400
Go on. try me.

1485
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.680
It's kind of hard-core stuff.

1486
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.240
No way could I share it
with the girl's big brother.

1487
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.280
My sister and I are super-close.
We talk about everything.

1488
01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.800
I'm not gonna lie...

1489
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.240
that's partly why I wanted you
to share a room last night.

1490
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.640
I thought maybe Merve
would open up to you.

1491
01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.240
About what?

1492
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.520
(exhales)

1493
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320
(laughs)

1494
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:09.000
Sure you want to talk about this?
Let's not fall out. bro-in-law.

1495
01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.880
No. I'm sure. Go on.

1496
01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.080
Okay. Merve and I have been together
for around a year.

1497
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.640
But we're yet to get to stage two.

1498
01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.560
You will. You're getting married.

1499
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.640
No. it's not that.
I'm talking about stage two.

1500
01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:32.880
You lost me.

1501
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.520
You know. stage two.

1502
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.080
I mean. like. stage two.

1503
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.040
I can't seem to convince Merve.

1504
01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.560
I worry that I'm doing something wrong

1505
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.720
something she doesn't like.
and that's why it's not happening.

1506
01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.640
So you wanted to talk about that.

1507
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.080
Did Merve say anything?

1508
01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.920
What about?

1509
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.120
Like. when we're alone together Poyraz
does this to me but I don't get turned on.

1510
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.800
I wish he'd do that.

1511
01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.600
Or you know. Poyraz kisses me here.
but I wish he'd kiss me there.

1512
01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.280
I guess you were right. We'd best...

1513
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.160
I start by caressing her here.

1514
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.640
Then I move down and kiss her here.
I breathe in her smell.

1515
01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.320
Then I touch her here

1516
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.000
and just when I'm about to go lower.
"No. stop!"

1517
01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.600
"Okay. Merve my love."

1518
01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.960
So then I'm like.
"How about I move down here?"

1519
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.320
"No. Poyraz!"

1520
01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.720
"Okay. Merve my love.
But can't you at least let me

1521
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.360
putter freely around here?"

1522
01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.920
Son of a bitch! Hands off the girl!

1523
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.120
-You wanted me to talk.
-Don't touch!

1524
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.280
It's a custom with us that no one touches
anyone until you're married for two years.

1525
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.240
-That custom sucks!
-Don't you trash our customs!

1526
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:05.720
They're our customs!
It's our way! Way! Way!

1527
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.320
See? You're a true bro.

1528
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.560
Bro.

1529
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.880
I'm sorry. I'm a bit hammered.
bro-in-law. Forgive me.

1530
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.360
I forgive you. but...

1531
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.560
Clearly. you're not gonna
forgive Merve. It's our way! Way!

1532
01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.960
Way!

1533
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.120
Way!

1534
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.200
In that case. let's forget all this.

1535
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.200
Let's go crash that henna do
and have a dance.

1536
01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.400
Huh? Bro-in-law? Let's go!

1537
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.440
Son of a bitch.

1538
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.920
What the guy did to the girl! Way.

1539
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.440
ASUMAN: <i>Honey. you still haven't answered.</i>

1540
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.320
<i>I'm in pieces.</i>
(sniffles)

1541
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.960
<i>Honey. come back and I promise</i>
<i>I'll stand by you on everything.</i>

1542
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.600
<i>I'll never abandon you.</i>

1543
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:09.760
-Hi!
-Hi. Shouldn't you be at the henna do?

1544
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.200
Yes. but I got kind of bored
and wanted to see you.

1545
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.480
Great!

1546
01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.680
It's cold here. though.
And I forgot my jacket. I'm frozen.

1547
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.000
-Let me give you my shirt.
-Really?

1548
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.640
Sure. Don't get cold. Here.

1549
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.920
My legs are still frozen.

1550
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.520
I can't give you my jeans.

1551
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.440
-Go on. why not?
-(laughs)

1552
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.280
So give me the T-shirt to wrap around.

1553
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.480
Oh. come on.

1554
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.480
I'd have seen those abs ripple.

1555
01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.520
More like fudge ripple these days.

1556
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

1557
01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.240
Fudge ripple is my favorite flavor
of ice cream.

1558
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.400
-Really?
-Yeah.

1559
01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.000
Great.

1560
01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.160
I'm shivering. Put your arm around me.
or at least do something.

1561
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.520
-Okay. come here.
-This is it.

1562
01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.480
-Tell you what.
-Yeah?

1563
01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.680
My hotel is really close. So if you want
a coffee or anything we can go there.

1564
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.360
I can't drink coffee.
It does things to me.

1565
01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.160
What. cellulite? Oh?

1566
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.320
No. I have tachycardia.
It gives me palpitations.

1567
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.400
-You're kidding?
-No. I can't do coffee.

1568
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.080
I'm just saying. come to the hotel.
let's check out the fudge ripple...

1569
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.720
-Canan.
-What?

1570
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.680
I'm married.

1571
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
You're married?

1572
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.840
I'm married.

1573
01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.200
And I love my wife.

1574
01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.840
You're kidding!

1575
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.160
-No.
-(laughs)

1576
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.600
I almost believed you.

1577
01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.760
I'm not kidding.
In fact. I'll show you. Look.

1578
01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.160
KORAY: See. isn't she beautiful?

1579
01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:57.760
Just look at her. What a sweetheart!
She can't fit in a selfie. What a doll!

1580
01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.600
So why make a move at me?

1581
01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.120
Call it a false move. Canan. Steps.

1582
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.960
Have a nice life. moron!

1583
01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.520
Wait a second!

1584
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.480
Give back my shirt.

1585
01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.800
No! I'll sell it and spend the money
like there's no tomorrow. okay?

1586
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.000
Dream on! It's a fake. Worth shit.

1587
01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:22.520
A fake like you. Jerk! Pocket that!

1588
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.440
You're just jealous! I would be too
if I were you. If you saw the girls!

1589
01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.560
Call me Climber Koray!
I climb the Himalayas every night.

1590
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.080
(faint slow music playing)

1591
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
(Haldun exhales)

1592
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080
Dad?

1593
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.280
Don't worry. Merve told me everything.

1594
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.440
Oh. yeah?

1595
01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.400
But you know. for a while
I really thought you were my son.

1596
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.440
Because you look just like his mom.

1597
01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.160
We look alike?

1598
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.120
You do.

1599
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.320
You're attractive. charismatic.
and sexy just like her.

1600
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.800
Sexy?

1601
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.680
But you hurt my girl big time.

1602
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.080
I wish I'd been around
to spit in your face.

1603
01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.440
You pissed on me today.
In fits and starts.

1604
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.080
(laughs)

1605
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.160
Can I make a confession?

1606
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.400
Merve's mom was the only woman
who's ever been right for me.

1607
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.920
When I messed her up.
I messed up my whole life.

1608
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.720
Be yourself. If you find
the right woman. never let her go.

1609
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.360
Be sure you stay committed to her.

1610
01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.440
Though I guess
it's a bit late for Merve. right?

1611
01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.640
I guess.

1612
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.520
(solemn music)

1613
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.840
(exhales)

1614
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520
(sniffles)

1615
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800
(exhales)

1616
01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.960
KORAY: What's up? Something gets you down?

1617
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.240
Coming here I never thought
I'd feel this way.

1618
01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.720
But yes.

1619
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.600
You say something got me down.
I say my life is fucked.

1620
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.240
-No. I say that.
-Okay.

1621
01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:56.960
So what are you gonna do?

1622
01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120
(somber music)

1623
01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.240
I can't bear to see Merve
marry someone else.

1624
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.720
Let's sneak away tomorrow morning.

1625
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.000
What about grandpa's money?

1626
01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.160
Dude.
If I stay here. I'll wreck the wedding.

1627
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240
I know I will.

1628
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.000
I can't take the money anyway.

1629
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.880
I should at least avoid
freaking people out.

1630
01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.960
Merve really deserves to be happy.

1631
01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.600
You know you'll go to jail. don't you?

1632
01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.000
Aren't you scared?

1633
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.040
Yes. I am.

1634
01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.320
But you still say we should go.

1635
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.040
Whoa! Listen to you.
laid-back. happy-go-lucky Erkin.

1636
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.760
Can't believe what you are saying.

1637
01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840
(somber music)

1638
01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.120
So what's up with Canan? You were talking.

1639
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.400
Canan?

1640
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.600
Nothing's up.

1641
01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.360
I love my wife. bro. She loves me too.

1642
01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.680
Love is a beautiful thing.

1643
01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.920
I felt lonely for the longest time.
but I don't with her.

1644
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.680
I've treated her like shit.

1645
01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Koray.

1646
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200
Yes?

1647
01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.160
Forgive me.
I've messed you around so much.

1648
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.680
True. there's nothing forgivable about me.

1649
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.000
I don't know when I screwed up so badly.
when I turned into this person.

1650
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.680
Bro. we had no mom. no dad.
It was you who raised me.

1651
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:49.880
No question that life can be a heavy load.
And sometimes that load can be crushing.

1652
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.440
I forgive you.

1653
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.120
-Really?
-Sure. I forgive you.

1654
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.760
(Erkin sniffles)

1655
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.840
(somber music continues)

1656
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.800
(Erkin exhales)

1657
01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.360
As we're unloading here.
I should also make a confession.

1658
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.720
Go on.

1659
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.800
Bro. I'm dying for a leak.

1660
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.960
(both laughing)

1661
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.920
Is it normal to get through so much beer?

1662
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.200
Use one of those empties there.
It'll help. We saw you on the boat today.

1663
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.680
See? It's the boat I was thinking of.
A dose on your face?

1664
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.280
-No! I want to forget that.
-Come on. Ammonia.

1665
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:48.760
-I want to delete the memory!
-Okay. fine.

1666
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.200
You erase it. I won't. Cheers!

1667
01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.280
Okay. we're out of there but aren't
we making things worse for Merve?

1668
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.800
We discussed that.
Trust me. this is the right thing.

1669
01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.040
Okay.

1670
01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.360
Stop at that hotel on the right. okay?
I need to take a leak.

1671
01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.280
What is it with your plumbing?

1672
01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.040
Why are you giving me a hard time?
For God's sake!

1673
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.720
Okay. I'll stop. It's a long trip.
I may as well take one too.

1674
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.920
Take a right just there.

1675
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.960
-Wait a second! Isn't that Poyraz?
-KORAY: Sure is. Who's that with him?

1676
01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.920
I can't see.

1677
01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.360
Look what he's doing! Your phone!
We have to get a video.

1678
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.440
-It's in the car.
-Mine too...

1679
01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.040
Dude! Give us your phone. it's urgent.

1680
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.760
-What the heck?
-We'll take a video and give it back.

1681
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.360
Okay. here you go.

1682
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.280
Open the camera.

1683
01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.120
-Someone's calling.
-My uncle.

1684
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.360
-Don't answer!
-Uncle?

1685
01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.640
They're going!
You need to give me the phone!

1686
01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.840
They've gone!
God damn you! It's all your fault!

1687
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.880
I'm talking to my uncle for God's sake!

1688
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.200
Hello? No. uncle. Everything's fine.

1689
01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.480
Your freaking uncle!

1690
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.880
We didn't see the girl either.

1691
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.920
-What do we do?
-Go tell Merve everything.

1692
01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.200
She was unhappy with me

1693
01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.040
but I can't let her be unhappier
with that jerk.

1694
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:34.240
-You're right. Let's go.
-Let's go.

1695
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.560
-ERKIN: Is she here?
-KORAY: She should be.

1696
01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.200
("Inno Nazionale" playing on phone)

1697
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.680
What are you doing?

1698
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.240
It's gonna be a tough talk.
Gotta lighten the mood beforehand.

1699
01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.920
-So what's that?
-Our song.

1700
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.800
What song is that?

1701
01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.400
The San Marino national anthem.

1702
01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.440
What does that have to do with anything?

1703
01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.600
I met Merve at a Türkiye-San Marino game.

1704
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.880
She wore something red and white.
It looked amazing. I'll never forget it.

1705
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.360
The national colors maybe?

1706
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:15.680
Yes. exactly! She was beautiful. I took
her arm. looked into her eyes and said...

1707
01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.960
"Shall we make this our song?"

1708
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.200
-Merve!
-Petal!

1709
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.320
Petal?

1710
01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.560
What's up? Why are you here?

1711
01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.960
Merve.

1712
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.520
We don't know how to tell you this.
but. how can we say?

1713
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.720
No idea. How can we say?

1714
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.720
Say it somehow whatever it is.

1715
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.640
-You say.
-You say. What's it to do with me?

1716
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.400
-You say.
-You say. It's your problem.

1717
01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.760
-You will...
-Come on. just say what you have to say!

1718
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:44.000
Okay. let's do it like we'd tell mom
when we did something bad.

1719
01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.960
-Okay. do it.
-You follow me.

1720
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.680

Say what you have to say!

1737
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.960
Poyraz is cheating on you.

1738
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.000
What?

1739
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.160
Yes. Poyraz is cheating on you.

1740
01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.920
How do you know?

1741
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.600
We were sneaking away this morning...

1742
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.240
Wait a second! Sneaking away?
Did I hear right?

1743
01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.280
Yes.

1744
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.480
Erkin. I don't believe you.

1745
01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.000
I asked you for one thing.
And you were ducking out of it.

1746
01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.280
Petal. that's not the issue.

1747
01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.520
Fuck your "petal!"

1748
01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.160
You run off a day before the wedding
and bad-mouth the man I'm marrying.

1749
01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.960
What kind of person are you?

1750
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.320
I saw it too. He's telling the truth.

1751
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.800
He lied to you. His life is a lie.

1752
01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:16.920
Okay. the guy messed you and me around.
But he's not a bad person.

1753
01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.240
Is that why he dumped me
three days before the wedding?

1754
01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.000
I was scared of making you unhappy.

1755
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.240
Screw you!

1756
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.240
Okay. but there's no place for bad blood.
Okay. kiss and make up.

1757
01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.520
Make up? What kind of idiot are you?

1758
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:34.760
Just kiss.

1759
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.040
-Okay with me.
-Fuck you!

1760
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.160
Not okay with me.

1761
01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.840
She's obviously not gonna make up.
Shall we?

1762
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.800
Let's.

1763
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.280
You just pick any song at random.
With my pencil mustache?

1764
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.960
I can't link them. You're better at it.

1765
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040
Who are you to pick the song?
I told you to leave it to me.

1766
01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:54.000
So is that it? Are we heading back?

1767
01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.560
Totally. You heard what she said to me.

1768
01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.480
She's too uptight to know
what she's saying.

1769
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.080
Her mind is still on you leaving
three days before the wedding.

1770
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.080
And just look at you. Who are you
to leave the girl? Why did you leave her?

1771
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.240
Remember I bet
the restaurant money on Barcelona?

1772
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.480
-Yeah?
-Add to that the wedding money

1773
01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.360
and money I saved for a house.

1774
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.320
I figured she deserved more
than a shit like me.

1775
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.480
So you're happy for her to marry a shit
like him? You're okay with that?

1776
01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.960
But she didn't believe what I said.
What am I supposed to do?

1777
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:28.120
She's hung up about you dumping her.
not being cheated on.

1778
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.680
Don't you get it? She really values you.

1779
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.720
Let's stay. There's still a day to go.

1780
01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.520
We'll prove he's a cheater and save her.

1781
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.760
Don't talk crap! Get in the car.

1782
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.840
Wait a second!

1783
01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.840
Erkin Koray has a great song mom and
dad played when we were kids. remember?

1784
01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.960
Which song?

1785
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.280
"Go tell her she's being cheated on."

1786
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.080
"You're her only love.
Go hug her right now."

1787
01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.840
I don't remember it. Sing the tune.

1788
01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.360
<i>♪ Go tell her she's being chea... ♪</i>

1789
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.880
-There is no such song.
-Of course. there isn't.

1790
01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.040
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

1791
01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.720
But I'd sing it great if there was.

1792
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.520
-You would.
-Bro. there's still 24 hours.

1793
01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.520
Let's prove it and save the girl.

1794
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.760
-So we stay?
-We stay.

1795
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.000
-Okay. let's stay.
-Yes! Give me five!

1796
01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.960
What. now of all times?

1797
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.080
You're wired. so you want to.
Come on. do it.

1798
01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.880
-Sure I want to.
-Come on.

1799
01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.080
-Sure I do!
-Come on.

1800
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.600
Here it is. White Golden.

1801
01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.960
ERKIN: Looks like that asshole
found the perfect place for this.

1802
01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:31.920
Yes.

1803
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.040
Nice to see you. bro...

1804
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.440
-What's up. bro-in-law?
-Just joking.

1805
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.960
-Just a joke.
-Enjoy!

1806
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.560
No. come and have a glass.

1807
01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.200
You have stuff to discuss.
Anatolian rock and all that. See you!

1808
01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.400
Cheers. bro-in-law!

1809
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.360
-Is it here?
-Here. come on.

1810
01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.720
Get it out!

1811
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.880
-To the back.
-(Poyraz panting)

1812
01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:54.040
(upbeat music)

1813
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.720
(Poyraz groaning)

1814
01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.800
-Go. go.
-(Poyraz groans)

1815
01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.080
(Erkin sighs)

1816
01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.560
The guy was really going for it
with his Pilates.

1817
01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.560
(laughs)

1818
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.440
Shut up. will you?

1819
01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.440
I can still hear his grunts. you know?

1820
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.400
We were after him all day and got nothing.

1821
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.000
I don't get why we took a room here.

1822
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.640
You think he'll come here
a day before the wedding?

1823
01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.760
(chuckles)

1824
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:28.840
-Don't be so sure. bro.
-What?

1825
01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.840
Come here. come on. Quick!

1826
01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.160
(suspenseful music)

1827
01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.400
KORAY: Who's that?

1828
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.000
-What do we do?
-Catch him in the act.

1829
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.320
-How?
-Come with me.

1830
01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.400
Let's go.

1831
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.400
(upbeat music)

1832
01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.040
(beeping)

1833
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.840
Empty room.

1834
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.920
Okay. let's go!

1835
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.880
They're not here either. Let's go.

1836
01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.320
ERKIN: Let's go.

1837
01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.600
-Okay. I'm going in.
-Quiet with the door.

1838
01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.120
(woman giggling)

1839
01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.960
(murmuring)

1840
01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.760
-Here goes!
-(woman screams)

1841
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.560
-Hey!
-We've been busted!

1842
01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.040
-Haldun?
-Şükran?

1843
01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.960
-Koray?
-What are you doing here?

1844
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.200
We saw nothing. heard nothing. Let's go.

1845
01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.800
-We did see something.
-We didn't.

1846
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.440
I think we did. but let's go.

1847
01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.560
We'll keep the video for a laugh.

1848
01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.920
-ŞÜKRAN: Delete it. Erkin!
-Get out!

1849
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.160
ŞÜKRAN: Erkin!

1850
01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.000
(murmuring)

1851
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.160
Go.

1852
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.240
(upbeat music)

1853
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.440
Hit record. hit record!

1854
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.840
ERKIN: Now you're busted. asshole!

1855
01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.160
No. no. You got the wrong idea.

1856
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.720
-Who was that woman?
-What woman?

1857
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.920
You're still denying it.

1858
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.080
You realize it's my wedding tomorrow?

1859
01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.480
POYRAZ: Let's not spoil it. huh?

1860
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.320
I don't want to upset your sister.
Give me that phone.

1861
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.920
Hands off!
Forget brother. I'm Merve's ex-fiancé.

1862
01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.720
-What?
-And I'm his brother.

1863
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.760
You're more surprised
that I'm his brother?

1864
01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.640
So that's why you whacked me
last night. asshole.

1865
01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.920
I'll whack you harder with this video.

1866
01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.320
-Give me that phone! Give it here!
-ERKIN: Get off!

1867
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.840
God!

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.160
-He locked it.

God damn it!

1875
01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.840
This way!

1876
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.600
Dude. lend us your bike!

1877
01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.600
I'm off to watch a game with my uncle.

1878
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.880
Not you again!

1879
01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.840
Hello! Prepare for a thrashing!

1881
01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.240
Look. Let's go to the cops
and tell them to find my phone.

1882
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.600
Tell them to find it. okay. But get
the groom arrested on her happy day?

1883
01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.400
-That's shameful.
-True.

1884
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.120
Okay. it's over then. Let's go back.

1885
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.800
I missed Asuman anyway.

1886
01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.960
You really love her?

1887
01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.680
I guess I do. Really.

1888
01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.120
I swore I'd never call
but I broke down yesterday.

1889
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.200
When I told her I'd be back soon.
she was ecstatic.

1890
01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.120
I'm so happy for you. At least one of us
should feel that way. Cheers!

1891
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.080
-Come on.
-Here.

Koray? What's with you?

1894
01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.000
Seemed like just the time.

1895
01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:41.040
Don't! Let's get out. grab breakfast.
then hit the road.

1896
01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.800
If we'd seen the girl and got
a confession. we'd have nailed it.

1897
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.320
But we didn't. Come on. out!

1898
01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.440
You go first. I'll follow.

1899
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520
ERKIN: Why?

1900
01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.000
I went for the full wash.

1901
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.680
God damn you!

1902
01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.920
(laughs)

1903
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.320
I have to clean the entire bed now!

1904
01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.280
Still one point.

1905
01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.520
No! With extracurricular credits?

1906
01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.720
-One point.
-No way!

1907
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.040
(laughs)

1908
01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.320
But Merve's dad. whoa!

1909
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.480
The father of all...

1910
01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.600
-I swear to God...
-The guy's in a league of his own.

1911
01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.880
Like a nuclear warhead. What do you think?

1912
01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.560
Sure you'd be a player hung like that.

1913
01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.360
You couldn't stop it.
We're talking about a bay stallion.

1914
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.840

1915
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.200

1916
01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.320
No. don't.

1917
01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.960
MAYOR: Merve Nihal Hazaloğlu.

1918
01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.640
do you agree to marry
Poyraz Çetinkaya of your own free will?

1919
01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.680
Yes!

1920
01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.720
Bravo!
(whistles)

1921
01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.760
Let's hear the consent of the witnesses.

1922
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.400
Yes!

1923
01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.520
Yes!

1924
01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.280
By the powers vested in me as mayor...

1925
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.960
Wait one second! Can you make way?
Excuse me. Sorry.

1926
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:14.960
(mutters)

1927
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.520
This wedding can't go ahead.

1928
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.160
What do you mean?

1929
01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.000
I may not be 100 percent sure

1930
01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.520
but if I know Merve and I do.
this wedding can't go ahead.

1931
01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:27.560
Erkin. for God's sake!
You want to wreck a wedding again?

1932
01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.720
Poyraz is having an affair with Canan.

1933
01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.080
-What?
-What? Don't be so ridiculous!

1934
01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:36.480
Honey. it's so not true. That's slander!

1935
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.760
Mr. Erkin!
We all know what a liar you are.

1936
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.240
-Really?
-Poyraz!

1937
01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.880
What? I know he's your ex-fiancé.

1938
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.120
-But do you know I'm his brother?
-Yeah.

1939
01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.120
And you're all surprised by that!

1940
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.000
Everyone listen.

1941
01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.160
We got it all on camera last night.
But he nabbed the phone from us.

1942
01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.960
We didn't get to see who he was with.

1943
01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.360
So we got thinking.

1944
01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.680
In our fight for the phone.
both of our hands touched Poyraz's.

1945
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.120
And we found ourselves itching all night.

1946
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.000
-So we got thinking.
-What was making us itch?

1947
01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.920
Could it be a sun cream
containing coconut?

1948
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.880
So how did it get on Poyraz's hands?

1949
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.840
-From Canan of course!
-So we got thinking.

1950
01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.120
-No. we cracked it.
-From Canan!

1951
01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.520
Poyraz. Canan. what are they saying?

1952
01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.200
They're talking crap as always.

1953
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.680
You come and fuck up the wedding
when you have zero proof. Fuckers!

1954
01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:33.360
-Fuckers!
-It's bullshit. You have no proof!

1955
01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.200
-See?
-We do! I'm afraid we do.

1956
01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.560
Aunt?

1957
01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.080
I already had my suspicions.

1958
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.360
When you came back rattled last night.
I went through your pockets.

1959
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.960
-And found this.
-My phone!

1960
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.640
-Aunt? How can you do this to me?
-ERKIN: <i>Now you're busted. asshole.</i>

1961
01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:54.680
Nephew or not.
no man can do this to a woman.

1962
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.720
You can't do this!
Honey. they're making it up!

1963
01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.720
Look. sweetie.

1964
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.000
You want to know
what happened last night? Honey...

1965
01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.280
You deserved it.

1966
01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.120
-Take it.
-Sweetie! Precious! My everything!

1967
01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.080
-Honey. I'm sorry.
-ŞÜKRAN: Merve!

1968
01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.640
(indistinct shouts)

1969
01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.280
Why would you do it?

1970
01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.640
Because Poyraz is my ex.
I was madly in love with him.

1971
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.440
Okay? Does everyone get that?

1972
01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.640
In fact. I almost married you
to let go of him.

1973
01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.200
Yes! Then like an idiot I set him up
with Merve thinking I'd forget him.

1974
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.920
But that didn't work either.

1975
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.560
When someone else gets your stuff.

1976
01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:42.120
you just want them even more!

1977
01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.720
Stuff?

1978
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.800
So why make a move at me?

1979
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.480
Whatever. I'm going.

1980
01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.480
Oh! She nicked the ring!

1981
01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.640
She'll spend the money...

1982
01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.760
-Like there's no...
-ERKIN: Tomorrow.

1983
01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.960
Here. have your phone back.

1984
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.960
-Great job!
-Great job!

1985
01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.560
I wasn't gonna say anything.
It's you guys who spurred me on.

1986
01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.200
You deserve the credit.

1987
01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.480
Thanks.

1988
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.680
By the way.
there is actually a guy I fancy.

1989
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.480
I was just kidding around with you.

1990
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.160
With a hunk like this around.
I'd hardly have eyes for you.

1991
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:14.120
-I knew it! Yes!
-Shut it!

1992
01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.160
What should I do? Should I check on Merve?

1993
01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.240
She'll be pissed now. In a bit.

1994
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.360
What's up?

1995
01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:27.680
Great job. bro! You're in the game!

1996
01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.680
(tongue clucks)

1997
01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.840
Excuse us. everyone.
Sorry for wrecking the wedding.

1998
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.160
Then again. you get to keep the gold.

1999
01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.480
See that lady whip a gold coin
back into her purse?

2000
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.400
-KORAY: She...
-She looks so happy.

2001
01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.440
-Wait.
-What's up?

2002
01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.720
KORAY: Fuck!

2003
01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.320
You wrecked everything!

2004
01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.080
-What do we do?
-What do you mean? Let him come.

2005
01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.360
You wrecked my life!
You wrecked the wedding!

2006
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.920
You wrecked me! Don't run!

2007
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.120
We're not running!

2008
01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.200
-Bro. let's run.
-You can't run!

2009
01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.800
We're not running!

2010
01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.960
Let's run. bro. See behind you?

2011
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.360
You couldn't run if you tried.

2012
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.440
Dude! Who's trying to run?

2013
01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.480
Me! I want to run!
Why won't anyone listen?

2014
01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.920
Bambam! Ozi!
Let's take the guys for a spin.

2015
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.080
Go right ahead. Come here. Go for it.

2016
01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.480
-(gunshot)
-(all shriek)

2017
01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.880
No one can touch my son!

2018
01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.200
Is that Terminator?

2019
01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.280
POYRAZ: Run!

2020
01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:23.600
Don't run. you bastards!

2021
01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.640
-Sweetheart!
-Honey!

2022
01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.640
-I missed you so much.
-ASUMAN: Me too.

2023
01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.480
You brought the girls with you.

2024
01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.280
Where would I leave them?

2025
01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.520
(gentle music)

2026
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.200
-I'm gonna check on Merve.
-KORAY: Okay.

2027
01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:39.840
Dad.

2028
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:43.840
HALDUN: Şüko.

2029
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.280
(birds squawking)

2030
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.080
Don't say a word about us to Merve.

2031
01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160
Okay.

2032
01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.480
She can't take two shocks in one day.

2033
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.600
Okay.

2034
01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.560
(exhales)

2035
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.880
(Erkin grunts)

2036
01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.240
(exhales)

2037
01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.440
I had to do it.

2038
01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.440
I knew deep down
you were telling the truth.

2039
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.800
But I didn't want to believe it.

2040
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.200
(Merve laughing)

2041
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.720
What?

2042
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.320
Do you have to wreck
every beautiful moment?

2043
01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.160
You're just there at the right time.

2044
01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.600
(laughs)
Seriously!

2045
01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.800
(Erkin laughing)

2046
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Merve.

2047
01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.080
(light music)

2048
01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.600
I thought I'd come here to say sorry.

2049
01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.400
but I guess it was to say I missed you.

2050
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.560
I missed you too. All your crazy shit.

2051
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.160
(laughs)

2052
01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.360
True.

2053
01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.120
(both laugh)

2054
01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.040
What are you doing?

2055
01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.040
No time like the present. huh?

2056
01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.040
I was getting married
10 minutes ago. animal!

2057
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.120
Slow down!

2058
01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.840
I'm still in my wedding dress.

2059
01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.720
(laughs)

2060
01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.400
I'm sorry. That's the second time. Sorry.

2061
01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.040
(both laughing)

2062
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.120
You jump on the first opportunity.

2063
01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.760
It has everything to do with you.
I can normally stop myself.

2064
01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.440
-Then stop yourself.
-I can't.

2065
01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.600
-You have to. Stop!
-I will if I can. Okay. I stopped.

2066
01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.520
(laughs)

2067
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.280
You always have to have the last word.

2068
01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.240
-Okay. you have it.
-There. see?

2069
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.760
(both laugh)

2070
01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.040
That's the last word? "There. see?"

2071
01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.800
(both laughing)

2072
01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.360
ERKIN: Merve.
Suppose we start over from scratch?

2073
01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.000
MERVE: What kind of scratch?

2074
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.480
ERKIN: Want to go out with me?

2075
01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.840
-MERVE: That kind of scratch?
-ERKIN: Will you or won't you?

2076
01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.920
MERVE: Erkin! I'm still
in my wedding dress. Why don't you get it?

2077
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.160
ERKIN: So take it off.

2078
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.640
-MERVE: Here?
-ERKIN: Yeah.

2079
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.320
-MERVE: Moron!
-(Erkin laughing)

2080
01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.120
