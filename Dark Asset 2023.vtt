00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:50.286
- She's with the agency.

187
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.897
- Well then Ms. Agent.

188
00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:54.856
why don't you go sit in
the corner over there?

189

are talking now.

[Titit snickering]

191
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.297

start and I'll be happy to.

192
00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:02.168
- Enough!

193
00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:05.475
We're gonna activate
the original subjects.

194
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.089
- Well then. don't
forget my favorite girl.

195
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.658
- I wouldn't dream
of it. Senator.

196
00:18:16.704 --> 00:18:19.010

test your gender hypothesis.

[tense music]

199
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.935
- I thought meeting
in dark. scary alleys

200
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:17.156
in foreign countries
was my thing not yours?

201
00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.897
- Dark. scary alleys are the
only place I'm safe right now.

202
00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:22.204
- Why come to me?

203
00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:23.901
- Because Ylan said
I could trust you.

204
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:25.816
- No. he didn't.

205
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:30.517
- No. he didn't.

206
00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:34.129

you would understand

what needed to be done.

208

- Why am I in London?

lot of time. okay?

210

One of the chip program

212

a lot of turbulence.

What's your story. John?

make them super smart.

- Which half?

- Not the one you
were hoping for.

It's a work in progress.

258
00:25:01.282 --> 00:25:02.370
- Maybe they should
have perfected it

259
00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:04.938
before they implanted
it in your head.

260
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:09.116
- They tried. there was a
version of the chip before mine.

261
00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.553
- Did it cause the owner to
crash and burn with the ladies

told me her preferences.

- Mm. touche.

265
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.913
So who was this poor guinea pig?

00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:31.834
- Han Wynn. a
Vietnamese operative

267

was the original subject.

268
00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:37.231
I guess they didn't wanna
test it on one of their own

269
00:25:37.274 --> 00:25:39.494
until they were sure it worked.

there owed him a favor.

- Benson wasted no time
putting Han to work.

It was supposed to be a
simple file retrieval job.

284

put her into survival mode.

289
00:27:41.572 --> 00:27:45.489
Once the threat was
eliminated. the chip disengaged

290
00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:50.451
and Han realized
what she had become.

291
00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:56.675
- I take it Han didn't like
having a super spy chip

292
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:57.588
in her head?

293
00:27:57.632 --> 00:27:58.894
- No she didn't.

294
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:01.288
- But you do?

295
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.031
- I do now.

296
00:28:05.074 --> 00:28:07.555
especially if it allows
me to spend time with you.

297
00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:10.514
- [chuckling] Okay.
that was a better line.

298
00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:13.953
Cheesy. but better.

299
00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:16.129
- I told you I was super smart.

300
00:28:16.172 --> 00:28:17.696
- I wouldn't take it that far.

301
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:24.311
So is your plan to convince
me to go back to your place

302
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:25.921
before my friend gets here?

303
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:28.532
- Nope. your plan
is to convince me

304
00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:30.926
to go back to your place
before your friend gets here.

305
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.624
- [chuckling] Really?

306
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.280
Well. your story would've to
get a hell of a lot better

Thank you.

310
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.817
- Aren't you breaking some
super spy code or something

311
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.862
by telling me all this?

312
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:55.516
- Most definitely.

313
00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:56.909
- Won't you get into trouble?

314
00:28:57.997 --> 00:28:58.824
- Already did.

315
00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:00.913
And so did Han.

316
00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:03.959
Her chip didn't come
with all the bells

317
00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:05.569
and whistles mine does.

318
00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:07.833
No tracking or safety
protocols either.

319
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.925
She wanted out. but
that's not how this works.

[gun bangs]

321
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:29.463
- Benson killed her?

322
00:29:30.899 --> 00:29:33.815
- Technically. yes. but
really the doctor did

323
00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:36.600
at the moment he put that
chip in agent Han's head.

324
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:37.950
- The doctor?

325
00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:40.822
- Dr. Cain. the one
who invented the chip.

326
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.781
the one responsible
for the whole program.

327
00:29:44.565 --> 00:29:47.481
- Nature knows no pause on
progress and development

328
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.877
and attaches her
curse on all inaction.

329
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:56.707
- Oh. that Dr. Cain.

330
00:29:56.751 --> 00:29:59.667
The secret super spy doctor.

331
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.191
The one who apparently likes
quoting George Bernard Shaw.

332
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:03.105
- That's the one.

333
00:30:05.412 --> 00:30:08.458
- But I've never heard
of Senator Benson.

334
00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:11.505
- Former senator. and
why would you have?

335
00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:12.723
Unless you lived in his state

336
00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:14.160
or cared about
appropriation bills.

337
00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:17.641
- That makes sense.

338
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.556
He doesn't sound like
a very nice guy either.

339
00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:21.471
- He's not.

340
00:30:23.604 --> 00:30:25.954
- But at least he chose you
to be the first American

341
00:30:25.998 --> 00:30:28.304
to get a super chip
implanted in his head.

342
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.697
- Not even close.

343
00:30:30.741 --> 00:30:32.221
I wasn't even the most American.

344
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:37.139
That honor went to American
Indian. Ylan Romero.

[serene music]

346
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.231
After the Han disaster.

347
00:30:42.275 --> 00:30:44.451
the doctor was allowed to
choose the next subject.

348
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:58.247
- A woman from
Washington is here.

349
00:30:59.553 --> 00:31:01.642
- [John] Ylan was a former
special forces soldier like me.

350
00:31:03.557 --> 00:31:07.778
Also like me. he had no
family. no connections.

351
00:31:07.822 --> 00:31:08.910
and no one to miss him.

352
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.305
except for his old friend.

353
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:14.655
the tribal police chief.

354
00:31:14.698 --> 00:31:17.440
- We'll watch you on TV
when you get your medal.

355
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:18.877
- It won't be televised.

356
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.924
Secret heroes just disappear.

357
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.897
[car door slams shut]

358
00:31:43.597 --> 00:31:45.077
- Welcome to the program.

359
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.429
- But Ylan ended
up going rogue too.

360
00:31:50.865 --> 00:31:52.867
He rescued someone
who needed rescuing

361
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.825
and exposed the whole
program to scrutiny.

362
00:31:55.826 --> 00:31:57.959
- The disappearing secret hero.

363
00:31:58.003 --> 00:31:59.221
- Marena sure thought so.

364
00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:01.876
- But who's Marena?

365
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:06.228
- An assistant to one of the
chip program's financiers.

366
00:32:06.272 --> 00:32:09.449
who stumbled across something
she wasn't supposed see.

367
00:32:11.625 --> 00:32:14.715
Her boss. Yuri Ketrov
had a lot of businesses.

368
00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:17.848
not all of them legal.

369
00:32:20.721 --> 00:32:22.375
Maybe Marina knew
about some of them.

370
00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:24.420
maybe she didn't.

371
00:32:25.595 --> 00:32:26.901
but she definitely didn't know

372
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:28.468
what she was gonna
find out that day.

373
00:32:31.688 --> 00:32:32.559
- What is this?

374
00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:37.390

[suspenseful music]

377
00:33:23.088 --> 00:33:25.351
- [John] She knew how
dangerous Ketrov could be.

378
00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.223
but she had made her decision.

379
00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:31.357
There was no going back.

380
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.548
[suspenseful music]

381
00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:07.409
- What you're doing is
wrong. and you know it.

382
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:11.065
- Give her to Terezin.

383
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.328
He always liked her.

384
00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:20.422
[Marena panting]

385
00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:24.992
- [John] And that's
when Ylan found her.

00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:29.127
[suspenseful music]

387
00:35:51.018 --> 00:35:53.847
[Marena screaming]

388
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:57.024
- I'll be back tonight.
[Marena sobbing]

389
00:35:57.067 --> 00:35:58.852
and I'll take you to my house

390
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.595
for a test run.

[door creaks]

394
00:36:27.228 --> 00:36:28.664
- Romero.
- Shh. shh.

395
00:36:29.796 --> 00:36:31.972
- But unlike the original chip.

396
00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:34.496
the one implanted in
Ylan did have tracking

397
00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.106
and safety protocols.

398
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.499
so they were able
to reign him in

399
00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:39.197
before things got
too outta control.

400
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:43.288
- You do have a lot of
details in your story.

401
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:44.637
I'll give you that.

402
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.595
- All good stories do.

403
00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:51.209
- Of course. and this
is where you come in?

404
00:36:51.252 --> 00:36:52.819
- No. not yet.

405
00:36:52.862 --> 00:36:54.908
I was still another
upgrade away.

406
00:36:54.951 --> 00:36:56.605
- Oh. do tell.

407
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.088
- After Ylan's shaky start.

408
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:04.483
they went right back to Benson
and his female subjects.

409
00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:05.919
- Easy on the eyes. I assume?

410
00:37:05.962 --> 00:37:09.836
- Of course. but this time.

411
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:12.665
they chose a
civilian Bindi Lamar.

412
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.538
supposedly saw her in a cafe.

413
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:21.282
The thought was that if
they could train someone

414
00:37:21.326 --> 00:37:24.764
from the ground up. they
would've total control.

415
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:27.680
a true sleeper agent.

416
00:37:33.512 --> 00:37:36.819

418
00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:48.309
- Fox.

419
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.403
wolf.

420
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:58.450
spider.

421
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:00.843
cheetah.

422
00:38:04.064 --> 00:38:05.718
hawk.

423
00:38:15.815 --> 00:38:16.772
- And then there was light.

424
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.253
- [John] And they wasted no time

425
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.646
in testing out the new recruit.

426
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:28.001
Mr. Titit. one of the
program's other financiers

427
00:38:28.044 --> 00:38:30.438
needed some files still
on the old fashioned way

428
00:38:30.482 --> 00:38:31.787
from a rival company.

429
00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:37.880
and he needed them
immediately. whatever the cost.

430
00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:42.189
So they sent the
unassuming Bindi

431
00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:43.886
to do what they
trained her to do.

432
00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:49.762
And if her natural
skills weren't enough.

433
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.810
they were confident that the
chip would fill in the gaps.

434
00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:00.120
And they were right.

435
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:09.695
- Here we go.

436
00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:13.916
[dramatic music]

437
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.803

[door creaks]

440
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:12.758
- Oh. hell. score
one for the ladies.

441
00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:15.935
And she didn't go rogue?

442
00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:18.328
- No. no. she didn't go rogue.

443
00:40:18.372 --> 00:40:19.852
After Han. none
of the ladies did.

444
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:21.810
- Oh. there were more?

445
00:40:24.073 --> 00:40:26.467
- Senator Benson
called them his crows

446
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:29.252
because they could be anywhere.

447
00:40:30.253 --> 00:40:31.951
always watching. always waiting.

448
00:40:33.648 --> 00:40:35.911
- This guy sounds like
the ultimate creepy uncle.

449
00:40:37.696 --> 00:40:40.089
I hope your story ends with
some super spy taking him out.

450
00:40:41.482 --> 00:40:43.441
- I agree. that would
be a good ending.

451
00:40:44.703 --> 00:40:46.269
- But unless you're secretly

452
00:40:46.313 --> 00:40:48.446
the woman I'm meeting
here tonight in disguise.

453
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:51.318
I assume that your program
started recruiting men again.

454
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:53.842
- They did. as you can guess.

455
00:40:53.886 --> 00:40:55.061
the doctor wasn't satisfied

456
00:40:55.104 --> 00:40:56.889
with creepy uncle
Benson's loyal.

457
00:40:56.932 --> 00:40:58.499
but limited city of crows.

458
00:41:00.022 --> 00:41:03.025
He wanted to push the
technology forward

459
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:05.680
and finally make a super spy.

460
00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:07.987
[dramatic music]

461
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.336

[gun clocking]

463
00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.254
I was a finely tuned weapon.

464
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.740
and that was before the chip.

465
00:41:25.657 --> 00:41:26.832
I had but two loves.

466
00:41:29.835 --> 00:41:30.836
serving my country.

467
00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:37.712
and the bottle.

468
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.068
Sometimes. that second one
got in the way of the first.

469
00:41:57.906 --> 00:42:00.518
That's how the doctor
recruited me for the program.

470
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:02.955
with the help

471
00:42:02.998 --> 00:42:06.785
of the doctor's very
convincing assistant. Vivian.

[gentle music]

473
00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:40.949
- You'll be better than before.

474
00:42:42.168 --> 00:42:45.214
smarter and more
skillful in every way.

475
00:42:45.258 --> 00:42:47.129
You'll have the
calculating power

476
00:42:47.173 --> 00:42:49.436
of the most advanced
microchip ever invented.

477
00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.875
assisting you in any and
all decisions you may face.

478
00:42:55.747 --> 00:42:57.400
There won't be
anything you can't do.

479
00:43:02.318 --> 00:43:04.277
- I'm honored and
lucky to be chosen.

480
00:43:06.322 --> 00:43:09.978
- There is no good luck.
only good planning.

481
00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:13.678
- [John] It wasn't
that hard of a sell.

482
00:43:15.288 --> 00:43:20.032
Being a super spy. who
wouldn't want that?

483
00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:22.643
- Oh. so that's why you
think I'm gonna take you back

484
00:43:22.687 --> 00:43:25.994
to my place because
Vivian picked you up

485
00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:27.082
and took you back to hers.

486
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:31.783
- Actually it was my place.
Vivian and I went back to.

487
00:43:31.826 --> 00:43:33.436
- Oh. well then.
we're good then.

488
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.437
- My thinking exactly.

489
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.052
- Either way. you could have
fooled me about being a drunk.

490
00:43:41.444 --> 00:43:42.968
You haven't even
touched your drink.

491
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.059
- Score another
one for the chip.

492
00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:51.150
- Then again. the
doctor couldn't have
his prized super spy

493
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:52.934
being a drunk now could he?

494
00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:53.892
- No he couldn't.

495
00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:56.546
But being sober has a way

496
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.548
of making you see
things more clearly.

Old test subjects.

509
00:45:04.614 --> 00:45:09.054
I didn't know if they were
dead. or discarded failures.

510
00:45:09.097 --> 00:45:12.013
or just previous attempts
lying there waiting for orders.

511
00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:16.104
And I didn't care.

512
00:45:18.324 --> 00:45:20.282
I just needed to
get to the basement.

your upgraded chip

523
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:06.100
really is the best version.

524
00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:07.406
- I'd like to think so.

525
00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:10.583
So how am I doing so far?

526
00:48:12.237 --> 00:48:15.066
- Well. considering
we're still in this bar.

527
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:18.373
not back at my place.
I'd say not so good.

528
00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:23.248
- As I said. the chip's
still a work in progress.

529

- I shouldn't be so hard on you.

00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:31.909
I'm just a lowly office drone

Yes. this is Jane.

I would much rather be
home wearing sweats.

who may or may not
have stood you up.

542

- True. but at least your
completely 100% real story

543
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.583
is entertaining me.

544
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:39.585
- And you have a
brand new Lamborghini.

545
00:49:39.628 --> 00:49:42.066
- And I have a brand
new Lamborghini.

546
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:45.330
[chuckling] please continue.

547
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.900
- [John] After the fight. I
finally made it to the basement.

548
00:49:50.944 --> 00:49:52.337
plugged in the damaged
tablet I swiped

549
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.599
from the doctor and Vivian.

550
00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:02.651
and sent out a message

551
00:50:02.695 --> 00:50:05.263
to activate all the
other chip owners.

552
00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:07.656
- He's trying to
get a message out.

553
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.702
- [John] Actually to
use the doctor's term.

554
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.531
I sent them all a suggestion.

555
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:17.014
- And what did you
suggest for them to do?

556
00:50:18.493 --> 00:50:20.234
- The only thing I could.

557
00:50:20.278 --> 00:50:23.324
do as trained and strike
back those responsible

558
00:50:23.368 --> 00:50:24.325
for the chip program.

559
00:50:35.641 --> 00:50:37.251
Bindi was back at the cafe.

560
00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:40.994
unknowingly waiting
for the moment

561
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:43.257
when they would
permanently deactivate her.

562
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:49.829
I made sure she at least
had one last hurrah.

563
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.889
Mr. Titit used her first.

564
00:51:09.196 --> 00:51:11.155
so I thought he
should see her last.

565
00:51:12.243 --> 00:51:15.898
[singing in foreign language]

566
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:36.702
[Titit screaming]
[dramatic music]

567
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:37.920
[gun bangs]

568
00:51:50.455 --> 00:51:51.978
The next suggestion
went to Ylan.

569
00:51:53.806 --> 00:51:56.113
Even though he was
back in the program.

570
00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:58.332
Ylan knew that after
rescuing Marina.

571
00:51:59.203 --> 00:52:00.378
his days were numbered.

572
00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:05.687
I'm sure he didn't
need much of a push

573
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:10.649
to go after the target
I sent him. Yuri Ketrov.

574
00:52:11.519 --> 00:52:14.131
[dramatic music]

575
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:38.067
[phone vibrating]

576
00:52:40.548 --> 00:52:41.810
- Hello.

577
00:52:44.683 --> 00:52:45.945
Victor!

578
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.998
[suspenseful music]

579
00:52:58.653 --> 00:53:01.395
[dramatic music]

580
00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:40.652
- Oh. this story got exciting.

581
00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:44.221
There's just one
problem with it.

582
00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:47.224
- Only one?

583
00:53:47.267 --> 00:53:48.616
- Well. let's start with one.

584
00:53:50.444 --> 00:53:54.231
So all the upgraded chips have
tracking and safety protocols

585
00:53:55.971 --> 00:53:58.191
and you say you have the
most upgraded chip there is.

586
00:53:59.627 --> 00:54:00.846
How are you even here?

587
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.504
Why aren't there soldiers or
spies kicking down the doors

588
00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:08.375
and shooting up the place?

589
00:54:08.419 --> 00:54:11.073
- You want me to skip
straight to the reveal?

590
00:54:11.117 --> 00:54:14.033
- Well. you said it
would only take an hour

591
00:54:14.076 --> 00:54:15.817
for you to explain why you
think I'm gonna take you back

592
00:54:15.861 --> 00:54:19.125
to my place. time's ticking.

593
00:54:19.168 --> 00:54:21.562
- And I have even less time
if your girlfriend shows up.

594
00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:23.782
- Not a girlfriend.

595
00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:26.524
just someone from the
business conference.

596
00:54:26.567 --> 00:54:28.177
Last minute meeting. I suppose.

597
00:54:28.221 --> 00:54:29.091
- Good to know.

598
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:32.704
Well. to answer your question.

599
00:54:32.747 --> 00:54:34.271
my chip was temporarily blocked.

600
00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:38.710
That's why they can't track me

601
00:54:38.753 --> 00:54:40.189
or enact any
protocols right now.

602
00:54:41.626 --> 00:54:46.152
- [chuckling] Oh. so
out of all the recruits.

603
00:54:46.195 --> 00:54:47.849
only yours was blocked?

604
00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:51.331
Sounds convenient.
- It wasn't.

605
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.294
Soon after my chip
was implanted.

606
00:54:57.337 --> 00:54:59.600
I met an agent. a real one.

607
00:55:00.427 --> 00:55:03.996
or rather. she met me.

608
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:08.827
[upbeat rock music]

609
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.665
- Can I buy you a drink?

610
00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:26.453
- I apparently no longer drink.

611
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:30.849
- Thanks to the chip I presume.

612
00:55:35.593 --> 00:55:36.420
- Who are you?

613
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:40.293
- Seems like that thing inside
your head does a lot more

614
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:41.512
than the doctor said.

615
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:46.691
none of it good for
you or the country.

616
00:55:48.475 --> 00:55:50.347
- If you knew the chip
was bad back then.

617
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:52.958
why didn't you just
have it removed?

618
00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:54.916
- The agent told me why.

619
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.441
something the doctor and
Vivian forgot to mention to me

620
00:55:57.484 --> 00:55:58.485
or the others.

621
00:56:01.314 --> 00:56:05.536
- If the chip is ever
removed or damaged.

622
00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:08.277
the effects on your brain
would be catastrophic.

623
00:56:13.108 --> 00:56:14.414
- Why are you telling me this?

624
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.938
- We have common interests.

625
00:56:18.679 --> 00:56:20.202
I'm not even supposed to
know about your existence

626
00:56:20.246 --> 00:56:22.683
until tomorrow when
the doctor provides me

627
00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:25.773
with a demonstration
of your talents.

628
00:56:26.992 --> 00:56:28.254
- Then how do you?

629
00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:33.912
- Former employee
of your new bosses

630
00:56:33.955 --> 00:56:35.609
suddenly grew a conscience.

631
00:56:37.568 --> 00:56:39.657
She also provided me
with an access code.

632
00:56:42.747 --> 00:56:43.791
- They can track me?

633
00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:47.099
- They can do a whole lot
more to you than that.

634
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:50.711
- What. I'm already dead?

635
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:57.414
- Not yet. when they fully
activate your chip tomorrow.

636
00:56:58.893 --> 00:57:00.765
their access to you will
miraculously be blocked.

637
00:57:02.157 --> 00:57:03.942
That is until their
techs figure out

638
00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:05.770
that we change the access codes.

639
00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:12.167
- Then what do I do?

640
00:57:12.211 --> 00:57:15.954
- What you do best.
you serve your country

641
00:57:17.259 --> 00:57:18.391
and eliminate the threat.

642
00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:20.349
[gun banging]

643
00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:21.916
- Abort!

644
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.049
- It's not working!
[glass shattering]

645
00:57:28.401 --> 00:57:29.663
[keyboard keys clacking]

646
00:57:29.707 --> 00:57:31.404
- And the first thing
I did with that code

647
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:33.711
before I sent out
the suggestions

648
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:34.973
was buy myself some more time.

649
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:38.890
And I'm sure Alex has been
working around the clock

650
00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:40.718
ever since. trying
to crack the problem.

651
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:42.937
[pensive dramatic music]

652
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:46.332
[keyboard keys clacking]

653
00:57:51.163 --> 00:57:53.557
- Anything?
- Soon.

654
00:57:55.123 --> 00:57:56.473
- What do we do
when we find him?

655
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.387
- You use this.

656
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.787
[taser zapping]

657
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:07.875
It'll damage the chip.

658
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.878
- [Vivian] And fry his brain.

659
00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:18.407
- Super spies versus
regular spies. interesting.

660
00:58:18.451 --> 00:58:19.452
- Something like that.

661
00:58:20.845 --> 00:58:23.630
- So who takes out
creepy uncle Benson?

662
00:58:23.674 --> 00:58:25.589
You?
- No.

663
00:58:25.632 --> 00:58:28.374
- He's a former senator. a
little tougher to get to.

664
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:30.898
- I thought you said there
would be a good ending

665
00:58:30.942 --> 00:58:31.856
to your story.

666
00:58:31.899 --> 00:58:35.163
- I did. but I'm just one man.

667
00:58:35.207 --> 00:58:38.427
I need a little help
with the happy ending.

668
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:41.518
- [chuckling] I bet you do.

669
00:58:44.564 --> 00:58:47.611
- But fortunately.
you already helped.

670
00:58:47.654 --> 00:58:48.916
- And how is that?

671
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:51.963
- Senator Benson's up
in your hotel room.

672
00:58:56.663 --> 00:58:58.143
- Excuse me?

673
00:58:58.186 --> 00:58:59.274
- That's why you're here.

674
00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:05.672
- I am here for a
business conference.

675
00:59:05.716 --> 00:59:07.631
- One that's conveniently
near this hotel.

676
00:59:11.199 --> 00:59:13.941
[dramatic music]

677
00:59:40.141 --> 00:59:41.578
[knocking on door]

678
00:59:45.233 --> 00:59:47.148
[door creaking]

679
00:59:48.454 --> 00:59:50.587
- There's my favorite girl.

680
00:59:51.849 --> 00:59:54.634
- Okay. that's not funny.

681
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:57.245
I've never even heard
of Senator Benson.

682
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:58.464
- Oh. he's hard to forget.

683
01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:14.523
- You lost a shoe.

684
01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:21.226
- I'm about to lose
a whole lot more.

685
01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.272
- Yes. you are.

686
01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:26.753
[tense music]

687
01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:11.015
[suspenseful music]

688
01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:22.113
[dramatic music]

689
01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:40.609
[door creaks]

690
01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.701
[dramatic music continues]

691
01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:48.443
[blows thudding]

692
01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:02.153
[Jane panting]

693
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.727
- Really. oh so now
I'm an assassin too?

694
01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:14.208
- I think you prefer
the term super spy.

695
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.123
- Oh. right. right.

696
01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:18.256
Did I just forget that too?

697
01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:21.955
- As Agent Wilds put it.

698
01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.478
the chip does a lot more

699
01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:25.089
than the doctor
told us it could do.

700
01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.134
none of it good for
you or the country.

701
01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:29.658
- What?

702
01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:34.620
- They have a literal
kill switch built in.

703
01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:36.491
a memory block doesn't
seem too crazy.

704
01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:43.455
- Wait. wait. wait.

705
01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:47.589
now you're saying I'm one
of the doctor's subjects?

706
01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.156
I have a chip in my head?

707
01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:54.205
- Pretty much. Jane Doe.

708
01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.774
[dramatic music]

709
01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:38.118
[dramatic music]

710
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.736
[phone line ringing]

711
01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:54.569
- I think I will be able
to meet you after all.

712
01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:58.269
[dramatic music]

713
01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:33.608
Oh my goodness. an expense
account. why not use it?

714
01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:36.873
Get some food. maybe a drink.

715
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:41.878
and then go to sleep.

716
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:03.377
- You're one of
Benson's crows. Jane.

717
01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:09.209
Well. you were one of
them. and now he's gone.

718
01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:16.477
- Okay. story time is over.

719
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.918
This has been very entertaining

720
01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:26.487
and probably one of the most
surreal nights of my life.

721
01:05:27.532 --> 01:05:28.750
- You were the only one of us

722
01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:31.884
who could have done
what you did. thank you.

723
01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:38.282
- Well. it was a pleasure
meeting you. John.

724
01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:42.677
Thank you for the Lamborghini.

725
01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:45.071
assuming there really is
one connected to these keys.

726
01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:46.812
- There is. it's yours.

727
01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:47.465
You deserve it.

728
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:51.817
- Right. well. it's getting late

729
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.862
and I have to go find the woman

730
01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.908
I was supposed to
meet here tonight.

731
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.692
- The one from your
business conference?

732
01:05:57.736 --> 01:06:00.130
- Yeah.
- She's not coming.

733
01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:04.003
- Oh. that's right.

734
01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:06.353
You know this because
you're super smart.

735
01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.659
- No. I know that

736
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.400
because Sarah Wilds was
never gonna come here.

737
01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:15.623
- I never told you
who I was meeting.

738
01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.277
How do you know her name?

739
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:19.976
- Because she's the agent I
met at the bar that night.

740
01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:22.456
[tense music]

741
01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:28.462
- Of course. of course.
of course she is.

742
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.291
All right. I'm leaving.

743
01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.641
Actually. I'm gonna go
to the ladies room first

744
01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:34.947
and then I'm gonna go back

745
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.776
to my hotel room
alone. thank you.

746
01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:39.952
Drinking some wine
and going to bed.

747
01:06:42.476 --> 01:06:44.609
- Does this mean you're not
taking me back to your place?

748
01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:46.132
- Goodbye John.

749
01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:47.829
- Ladies room?

750
01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:48.482
Thanks.

[door creaks]

753
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:10.896
Just a story.

754
01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:16.380
You're okay. you're okay.

755
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.396
A literal crazy person
just tried to pick me up.

756
01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:36.661
- Mm. there's a lot
of those around.

757
01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:40.578
- Right.

758
01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:49.500
[dramatic music]

759
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.550
- In case he comes back.

[ominous music]

767
01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:14.210
- He can give me a Lamborghini.
but he can't pay the bill.

768
01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:16.386
- Would you like me to
charge this to your room?

769
01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:23.219
- No. thank you. I'll pay cash.

770
01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:26.570
- Whenever you're ready.

771
01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:30.791
[ominous music]

772
01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:49.245
- You came back.

773
01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:50.768
Maybe I have a
shot with you yet.

774
01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:52.813
- Not a chance.

775
01:10:57.862 --> 01:10:59.646
- You know. this all ends
when you take me back

776
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.647
to your place.

777
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:07.045
- Still super cocky I see.
even creepy uncle Benson

778
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:09.743
had better pick up
skills than you do.

779
01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:10.570
- Ouch.

780
01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:23.104
You know. the doctor would
never let us go. Jane.

781
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:26.717
not until the next upgrade.

782
01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.808
and he's done with
us permanently.

[dramatic music]

784
01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:44.082
- Where's the tablet John?

785
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:47.303
- I gave it to Agent Wilds.

786
01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:51.611
[dramatic music]

787
01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:07.932
- You see Ketrov's
body out there?

788
01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:11.805
Suggestions you sent worked.

789
01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:12.893
- So did your access code.

790
01:12:16.593 --> 01:12:17.855
It's pretty damaged.

791
01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:20.771
- The agency can fix it.

792
01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:23.339
The agency can fix anything.

793
01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:27.125
- Not everything. I bought
myself some more time.

794
01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:31.869
- I'm glad. use it wisely.

795
01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:32.783
- I plan to.

796
01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.830
I need a car.

797
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.357
- Which one do you like?

798
01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.447
- Which one do you think?

799
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:49.800
- Have fun Mr. Doe.

800

[car engine roaring]

802
01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.798
- And that brings me back to you

803
01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:34.235
in this beautiful hotel bar.

804
01:13:36.934 --> 01:13:39.110
- Your Lamborghini is stolen.

805
01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:41.112
- No. your
Lamborghini is stolen.

806
01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.552
- What is she gonna
do with the tablet?

807
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:51.905
- She already did it.

[monitor beeping]

811
01:15:49.936 --> 01:15:52.504
You and I are the
only ones left.

812
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:57.204
- Why didn't she just kill
me when she had the chance?

813
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:07.388
Right. you needed me to
take out Benson first.

814
01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:09.521
- Don't worry. she's
not touching you.

815
01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.001
- Oh. I'm not worried.

816
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:17.224
Now. what's to stop Agent
Wilds from aborting you?

817
01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:20.097
- She can't. I
changed my access code

818
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.228
when I hacked the system.

819
01:16:23.796 --> 01:16:26.407
- Oh. but the doctor's still
gonna want that tablet back.

820
01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:30.194
- Oh. he can take it
up with the agency.

821
01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:32.936
send them a memo.
request it back.

822
01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:39.333
- All the program's
financiers are dead.

823
01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:41.292
You think you've won now?

824
01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:46.340
- No. there will
always be some rich guy

825
01:16:46.384 --> 01:16:48.081
who wants more power
over other people.

826
01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:54.044
But the chip program begins
and ends with Dr. Cain.

827
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.612
He's the final target.

828
01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:08.493
- Are you at least gonna
pay your bill first?

829
01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.018
- I don't have any money.

830
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.194
- Of course you don't.

831
01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:30.646
[dramatic music]

832
01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:53.320
- Let the agency keep
the tablet. John.

833
01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:57.324
I already cracked your
codes and made new ones.

835
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.069
Done.

836
01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:07.770
- Go get him.

837
01:18:09.336 --> 01:18:10.860
- How do you think we found you?

838
01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.299
- Because I wanted you all here.

839
01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:21.435
- Not all of us.

840
01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.700

about to get lucky with me?

- There's no good luck.

849
01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:09.152
only good planning.

850
01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:14.287
- You sound like Dr. Cain.

851
01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:17.769
- Well. I do have
his chip in my head.

up at another bar?

It won't be so easy this time.

- You'll always be easy. John.

865
01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.349
- We were dead the moment
that doctor put that chip

866
01:21:59.392 --> 01:22:00.437
in our head.

867
01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:03.831
- But we don't wanna kill you.

868
01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:07.139

01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:12.405
- Doctor's orders.
he wants to study it.

01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.583
- You said it yourself John.

871
01:22:17.758 --> 01:22:19.673
your chip is a work in progress.

872
01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:22.328
Doctor will never let you go.

01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:26.637

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.074
- And the next. and the next.

[tablet beeping]

884
01:23:35.227 --> 01:23:36.576
- Brain activity. minimal.

885
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:42.191
The damage done to the cerebral
cortex is catastrophic.

886
01:23:43.627 --> 01:23:47.500
He's not going anywhere ever.

887
01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:51.026
- So much the better.

888
01:23:52.418 --> 01:23:54.203
- The repairs to his
chip were successful.

889
01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.293
- Good.

890
01:24:00.426 --> 01:24:01.688
- Well. he said in the end.

891
01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:03.212
I would take him
back to my place.

892
01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:06.780
Guess he was right.

893
01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:11.263
- He even got into your bed.

894
01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:22.622
- If I may ask doctor. if he
is pretty much brain dead.

895
01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:25.408
why keep him alive at all?

896
01:24:27.192 --> 01:24:30.108
- Because the chip in his
head doesn't know that.

897
01:24:30.152 --> 01:24:33.807
It'll keep operating in
his body as if all is well.

898
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.461
And that data.

899
01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:38.334
I can use to create the
ultimate upgrade version.

01:24:40.988 --> 01:24:43.078
and the others kill all
the programs financiers.

902
01:24:45.863 --> 01:24:48.344
- There's always more
money to be found.

903
01:24:48.387 --> 01:24:49.519
- And more subjects.

904
01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:58.397
- I'm curious though.

905
01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:02.836
what were John Doe's last words?

906
01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:13.499
- He wished me good luck.

907
01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:20.027
- There's no such
thing as good luck.

908
01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:23.074
there's only good planning.

909
01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:25.250
- Exactly.

911
01:25:33.998 --> 01:25:35.217
- What are you doing?

912
01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.784
- You see. doctor.

913
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:41.919
John sent me a suggestion.

914
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:46.228
- I know. he wants to
assassinate Senator Benson.

915
01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:52.408
- No. mine was to
kill the chip program.

916
01:26:02.983 --> 01:26:07.553
And that program begins

917
01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:11.253
and ends with you.
