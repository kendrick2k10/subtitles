00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.220
-Father I thank you that I am the head-

5
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
-and not the tail.

6
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680
Above only and never beneath.

7
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.560
-The lender and not the borrower.

8
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.100
-The blessed and not the cursed.

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.150
-I have been given
and it shall be given unto me.

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.230
Good measure.

11
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.530
-Press down. shaken together.
running over. shall men give into my bosom.

12
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.440
-I am out of debt.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.070
My needs are met
and I have plenty more to put in store.

14
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.910
Money come to me now.

15
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.870
Right now in Jesus name.

16
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.950
-Hallelujah.

17
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.250
-Hello.

18
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.880
-Hey baby.

19
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.550
I was just about to hang up.

20
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.760
Did I catch you at a bad time?

21
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.220
-I'm doing my makeup mom.

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.840
What's up.

23
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.510
-I was seeing
if you were coming by after church today.

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.970
I made a big pot of red beans and rice.

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.600
-I was having lunch
with friends after church.

26
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.600
What's going on?

27
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.020
-Oh. well. your sister is in trouble.

28
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.030
-Ma this is really getting old.

29
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.030
How much does she need this time?

30
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.030
-Look. 7.000 or her house
is going to be foreclosed on.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.410
Now I can get 5.000 from my 401k.

32
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.160
but I was wondering
if you could add the rest.

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.410
-I don't have that money and neither do you.

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.920
You've got to start thinking
about your future.

35
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.210
-Well. how can I think about me
when my baby is in trouble?

36
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550
-Your baby is grown with a husband.

37
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.800
Let them figure it out on their own.

38
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.550
-I wish I could do more.

39
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.850
-You can stop making
their problem your problem.

40
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.720
Tell Tiffany to call me.

41
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.390
I could get her a job.

42
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.310
-Oh. that is terrific.

43
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.480
Thank you. baby.

44
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.730

-Jason is fine. fine.

161
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.320
How can you stand being around him
and not want to rip his clothes off?

162
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.820
-Maybe because she lives holy
and doesn't jump in a bed

163
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.780
with every man she meets like you.

164
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.870
because you didn't sleep
with him. right. Jessica?

165
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.450

Kelly: Jessica.

167
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.210

Did you sleep with Jason?

172
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.550
-Why are you so loud?

173
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.460
Kelly: Did you?

174
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.090

I did.

176
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.550
-Of course you did.

177
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.180
Of course you did.

178
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.720
Kelly: Oh. my God.

179
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.140
-Kelly.

180
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.930
You act like we don't remember
when you were single and a certified freak.

181
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.180
Kelly: Maybe I'm still certified.

182
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.850
-Yes.

183
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.520
That's okay though
because you're married now.

184
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.230
-Exactly.

185
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.650
-I am done with Jason.

186
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.520
[?] we still praying for you.

187
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.520
Kelly: Too hard.

188
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.440
-A little hard.

189
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.110
-I'm going to get there.

190
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.650
Kelly: So hard.

191
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.570
-Let's make a toast ladies.

192
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:15.080
Let's toast to forgetting the past.
our past mistakes. and focus on the future.

193
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.620
To the future.

194
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.580
[music]

195
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.880
Wow.

196
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.140
This place is so much bigger
and so much nicer.

197
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.760
-I figured you'd like this spot.

198
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.560
I have one basically just like it
being prepared for you now.

199
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.230
-You know what?

200
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.860
You've got yourself a deal.

201
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.400
Let me sign it.

202
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.410
-I guess we're neighbors again.
just like college.

203
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.620
Even more beautiful now than I remember.

204
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.420
-You know.
this is such a nice place.

205
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.590
Thank you.

206
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.840
-It's the least I could do.

207
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.760
To make up for the pain
that I've caused you.

208
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.840
-That was all in the past.

209
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.800
It's all good.

210
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.600
We're good.

211
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.180
-It was good.

212
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.890
It was really good.

213
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.060
We were magical.

214
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.730
Don't you agree?

215
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.020
-Yes.

216
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.900
That was a long time ago
and things are different now.

217
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.240
-Some things are different.

218
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.200
Other things haven't changed at all.

219
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.030
-Oh.

220
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.120
I never noticed
how beautiful the city skyline is.

221
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.170
It's amazing.

222
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.380
-You should see it at nighttime.

223
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.470
Sometimes I come up here
and I turn off the lights in my office

224
00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.560
and I pour up a glass of wine
and I listen to some music and just chill.

225
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.770
-That sounds nice.

226
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.310
-It's going
to be really hard to do that now.

227
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.740
knowing the lady I love so much
is right beneath me.

228
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.700
-Well. why is it going to be hard?

229
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:29.380
-Because I would be tempted
to invite you up so we could do this.

230
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.850
-I can't believe that just happened.

231
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.850
This is not how I planned
on starting my day.

232
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.270
-Well. it was an exceptional start.

233
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.190
-You know what Jason--

234
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.230
-Look. look. look.
there's nothing for you to be ashamed of.

235
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.690
Okay.

236
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.780
It's obvious we both still have feelings
for each other and it is what it is.

237
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.200
All right.

238
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.620
Look. I know how expensive
it can be starting up a new business

239
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.540
to lighten up some of that pressure.

240
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.670
I'll waive your down payment
and your first month's rent.

241
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.380
-Really?

242
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.170
-Yes.

243
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.210
-You're sure?

244
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.550
-Yes.

245
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.170
-Thank you.

246
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.470
-You've already thanked me.

247
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.840
We should do this again tonight though.

248
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.480
Till then I'll be
in my office if you need me.

249
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.650
-I'm sorry Lord. forgive me.

250
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.450
You know I am not perfect
and I am still a work in progress.

251
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.620
I know that I've sinned.
but please do not take your blessings away from me

252
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.830
in Jesus name I pray.

253
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.740
Amen.

254
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.330
[music]

255
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.050
Hey. getting any calls?

256
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.090
-No. for the 15th time.
girl. pray or something.

257
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.430
-That's all I've been doing.
is praying for the past few weeks.

258
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.430
I need some money.

259
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.600
-Well. sis if you're going to pray. don't worry

260
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.430
and if you're going to worry. don't pray.

261
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.100
-Shut up.

262
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.530
-Hey. I know you.
you go to my church. right?

263
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.450
Mr and Mrs. Brown.

264
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.620
-Yes ma'am. that's us. 10 years faithful service.

265
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.240
-Okay.

266
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.200
Well. welcome to Jessica Clark's Realty.

267
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.660
What can I do for you today?

268
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.410
-We're very excited.

269
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.380
We're here about the house
for sale on Imperial Drive.

270
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.040
-Okay.

271
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.580
Sure.

272
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.420
Well. let me take you to Jessica office. follow me.

273
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.720
-Well I'm so glad you guys like the house.

274
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.430
It is so beautiful.

275
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.270
The asking price is $350.000.

276
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.020
Do you have any financing in place?

277
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.900
-Of course we do.

278
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.110
Jesus paid it all
and he shall supply all my needs.

279
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.860
We missed about that.

280
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.530
-Yes.

281
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.700
How much
has the bank approved you for.

282
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.290
-Bank?

283
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.630
We haven't gone through a bank per se.
but this is what you can do.

284
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.590
Draw up the paperwork
because this house is going to be ours.

285
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.550
God is going to position us
to buy this house cash.

286
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.600
I'm telling you that now we sowed
our seed on Sunday

287
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.970
and we are expecting a harvest any day now.

288
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.520
-Preach baby.

289
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.640
-Let. just get this straight.

290
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.650
You all don't have any money
to purchase this house at all?

291
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:44.570
-Well. technically I'm between jobs.
but she's on disability.

292
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.950
-Oh. hallelujah.

293
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.490
-She's got some stuff coming in.

294
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.370
-I get something in baby.

295
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.160
-We don't have to worry about that
because favor is sufficient

296
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.290
and we are going to get this house.

297
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.120
-Oh. yes.

298
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.460
You know what?

299
00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.830
I feel the sizzling.

300
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.550
Oh. it's all in my spirit. child.

301
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.840
Let me tell you deep down
inside of the recession of my soul.

302
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.220
I know God is going to do something
and I can't wait. honey.

303
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.100
Do you hear love muffin?

304
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.730
Don't you feel excitement
for us Sister Cark?

305
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.100
-So excited.

306
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.730
-Yes.

307
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.150
-Sister Washington.
it looks like all of your documents are in order

308
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.570
and you're ready to purchase a house.

309
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.450
-Well. actually we'll be purchasing two houses today.

310
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.910
One for me and the kids.
and one for him and his side chick.

311
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.210
-Hey. wait.

312
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.500
-Oh. you didn't think I knew about you and Sister Jones.

313
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.500
-Wait. this ain't--
Yes. they got a thing going on.

314
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.550
-This ain't the place for that.

315
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.550
-Shut up and just look straight.

316
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.380
Because when I finish with you.
I'll be able to purchase this house

317
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.590
with cash with your trifling ass.

318
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640
-Wait. language baby.

319
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.220
Language.

320
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.930
-The language?

321
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.640
Step outside. I have some language for you.
and it won't be speaking in tongues either.

322
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.690
-Lord have mercy.

323
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.860
-I'm saying this.

324
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.780
I can have the money tomorrow.

325
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.200
Only thing I need you to do
is co-sign for me.

326
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.910
See. I got the money at the house.
it's all under the bed. all in the safe.

327
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.490
[?] and everything.

328
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.120
-See Deacon. I just can't help you.

329
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.450
-I know what you're saying. but the honest thing

330
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.920
is I can't put the money in the bank
with all the child support people.

331
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.380
they're going to take everything away.

332
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.960
Now I know what you thinking.

333
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.960
Once you get the revelation. you'll co-sing it.

334
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.510
-Get Liz on the phone.

335
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.600
-Hi. Liz. Jessica wants to speak--

336
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.480
-Hey Liz. listen to me good.
stop giving those people my number at the church.

337
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.150
they are all freaking crazy.

338
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.110
Hang it up.

339
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.980
Any messages?

340
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.030
-Nope. but Jason is in your office waiting for you.

341
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.740
-What day is it?

342
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.360
-The second.

343
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.750
-Ssh. I'll be right back.

344
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.170
Hi Jason.

345
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.010
-This is a very nice chair.

346
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.130
Close the door behind you.

347
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.850
-I'm not closing the door.
and you need to get up because that's my spot.

348
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.890
-Oh. I know exactly where your spot is.

349
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.480
You're acting funny now?

350
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.360
How's business.

351
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.650
-Not so good.

352
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.240
I haven't sold any houses.

353
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.410
This is a lot harder than I thought.

354
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.540
-So what's your plan
for rent this month?

355
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.750
-I don't have it all as of yet.
but I will in about a week or so.

356
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.540
I was hoping that I can get an extension.

357
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.090
-That's not how this works. Jessica.
but here's what we can do.

358
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.720
We're both business people.
let's make a deal.

359
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.720
-What kind of deal?

360
00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.230
-You give me 30 minutes
of your time a few times a week

361
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.520
and I'll give you 30 days rent free.

362
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.520
-30 minutes.

363
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.440
-Come on. Jessica.

364
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.990
You're seen the view.
you know what I want?

365
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.280
-I don't know Jason.
just give me a few days. okay.

366
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.330
I will pay your rent.

367
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.280
I'll get it.

368
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.870
-You already got it.

369
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.790
You have everything I need.

370
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.710
-No. Jason.

371
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.420
I'm not about to let you pimp me
around like I'm some whore.

372
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.090
-I am your pimp.

373
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:38.680
Whether you like it or not. come the first
you're either going to give me money or honey.

374
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.970
to be in this building.

375
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.890
-Well. I'll just move

376
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.150
-You're going to pay me
for the next 12 months rent as written in your lease

377
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.610
that you just signed.
which clearly you didn't read.

378
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.950
-You are such a jerk.

379
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.160
You'll get your money
in a couple of days.

380
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.910
-You have until the 5th.

381
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.040
[music]

382
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.300
-Excuse me. Jessica.

383
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.670
Hey. do you have a moment?

384
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.680
-No. not really.

385
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.470
-Look. I know this may not be
a good time for you.

386
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.970
but will I be getting a check today?

387
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.770
I have bills I have to take care of.

388
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.440
-Join the club.

389
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.440
-Jessica I need to get paid today.

390
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.610
-Tiffany. I haven't sold any houses.

391
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.240
-I understand that sis.
but that's not my problem.

392
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.620
You hired me to do a job and I've been doing that
for four weeks now faithfully.

393
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.160
I need to get paid for my time.

394
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.540
-I will need to get paid too.

395
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.170
I've got bills. mortgage car payments.

396
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.710
-I have a husband who's not working.
with two kids I have to feed.

397
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.670
-Is that supposed to make you better
than me because you're married?

398
00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.300
I've got more responsibility
than you can ever dream of.

399
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.760
It ain't my fault you married some broke negro
who can't provide for his family.

400
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.140
-You're just jealous.

401
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.480
-Of what?

402
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.070
You ain't nothing to be jealous of.

403
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.860
You're on welfare.

404
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.610
You married to a loser.

405
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.280
You about to be homeless
and your kids look dirty.

406
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.910
-Look. don't you talk about kids.

407
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.620
Do you hear me?

408
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.490
Don't you ever say anything about my kids?

409
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.000
You them out of your mouth.
do you hear me?

410
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.710
This is not their fault.

411
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.380
It's just that I've going
through a hard time.

412
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.640
I thought that you out
of all people would understand.

413
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:53.020
but you're too selfish and bitter
to care about anybody but yourself.

414
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.030
-Tiffany wait.

415
00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.030
No. I didn't mean it.

416
00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.780
Wait.

417
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.490
[music]

418
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.140
-Hello.

419
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.640
-How you doing?

420
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.980
Are you Ms. Clark?

421
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.730
-Yes.

422
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.560
-Awesome.

423
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.690
My name is Michael Junior
from M.A Junior Investment Group down the hall.

424
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:37.280
-Okay.

425
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.740
-Listen. I was coming in today
to see if you could give me a little help.

426
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.910
I'm looking for a property to lease.

427
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.530
Would you happen to have any available?

428
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.080
-Yes.

429
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:46.580
-That's awesome.

430
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:47.950
-There you go.

431
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.210
We do have this property available for lease.

432
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.420
If I may ask. why are you leasing
when you can be owning your own home

433
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.210
-Oh. well this won't be for me.

434
00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.670
I'm doing this for a friend.

435
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.550
-A friend. huh?

436
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.260
Sure it isn’t for one
of your little side pieces player player?

437
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.430
[laughs]

438
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.640
-Where’s this property located?

439
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.060
-Oh. it's just a few miles north of here.

440
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.190
We can go take a look at it if you like.

441
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.070
-That won't be necessary.

442
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.190
I'll have my handyman take a look at it
once I make my final decision.

443
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.820
For the most part.
this property looks decent.

444
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.780
How much are you asking for rent?

445
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.660
-$800 per month
and I do require one year lease.

446
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.750
-Oh. I won't be signing any lease.
but what I will do

447
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.460
is pay you $900 a month
until she's ready to move.

448
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.500
-Until she's ready to move?

449
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.590
Is that your best offer?

450
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.130
-It's my only offer.

451
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.390
-I guess you've got yourself a deal.

452
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.890
-Oh. Ms. Clark.

453
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.560
Hey. are you okay?

454
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.560
-Yes.

455
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.190
I'm sorry.

456
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.230
I've been fasting for the past three days.

457
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.480
Got a little lightheaded.

458
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.480
-Oh. I think this is a sign
that you need to get something to eat.

459
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.860
-Yes. I think you're right.

460
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.990
Thank you

461
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.830
-How long have you been in real estate?

462
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.500
-About 40 days.

463
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.500
-Really?

464
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.170
You’re a brand new business owner.

465
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.090
Congratulations.

466
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.710
-Thank you.

467
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.920
You're actually my first client

468
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.970
-Really?

469
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.010
Is real estate is something
you've always wanted to do?

470
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.640
-No.

471
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.760
Graphic and interior design was my passion.

472
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.230
but it didn't pay the bills
so I had to find another gig.

473
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.060
-Why real estate?

474
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.810
-Because I can make
a lot of money with no salary cap.

475
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.320
-This is true.
but real estate can be tough.

476
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.610
-I know.

477
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.200
That's why I've been fasting
and praying like crazy.

478
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.080
but it all worked out
because you're here.

479
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.870
-You think fasting and praying
is what brought me into your office?

480
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.250
It could have just been faith.

481
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040
-Yes.

482
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.500
My faith in God
is what brought you to my office.

483
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.250
Mr. Juniors.

484
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.050
Call it what you want.
but you are the answer to my prayers.

485
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.340
-Oh really?

486
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.090
-Yes.

487
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.090
[phone rings]

488
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:09.930
Oh. sorry.

489
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.560
Hello. mom?

490
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.560
Wait. calm down.

491
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.480
Wait.
I'm on my way.

492
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.650
I'm on my way right now.

493
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.400
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.990
I really got to go.

495
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.860
Thank you so much for breakfast.

496
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.780
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.710
Mom. what's the big emergency?

498
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.420
-Tiffany and Reginald got evicted
and need a place to stay.

499
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.050
I was hoping
that they could stay in your rental property.

500
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.800
-It's not available.

501
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.550
-She is lying.

502
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.890
That place has been vacant for months.

503
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.640
-I rented it out this morning.

504
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.890
besides I don't rent
to family because they don't pay.

505
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.520
-You're right.

506
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.770
They don't pay.

507
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.150
Since you rented out the place.
I guess you can run me my paycheck now.

508
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.530
-I need that money
to add a new carpet to the house.

509
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.150
-Reginald can put the carpet in.

510
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.780
He just needs to get paid in advance.

511
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.620
-What's the matter?

512
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.580
He can't speak for himself?

513
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.500
-Look. not today.

514
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:18.870
All right?

515
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.500
You know what--

516
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.710
-Oh my God.

517
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.750
-Come on kids.

518
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.500
Let's go.

519
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.880
-There he goes.

520
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.680
Running away like he always does.

521
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.350
She follows him around like a little puppy.

522
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.220
-You stay out of married folks business.

523
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.100
-No. they're pathetic.

524
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.730
-From what I hear.
you are not much better off than they are.

525
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.230
You were wrong for what you said
about your niece and nephew.

526
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.400
Just wrong.

527
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.360
-I apologized.

528
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.490
-Why haven't you paid Tiffany?

529
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.990
-I can't give her money I don't have.

530
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.580
Maybe the church can help.

531
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.290
They usually have money
set aside to help people with their bills.

532
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:13.220
-We just want to thank you so much
for your help and your time.

533
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.808
We didn't even know churches
did this kind of thing.

534
00:24:15.933 --> 00:24:17.560
We really are grateful.

535
00:24:17.643 --> 00:24:23.608
-I've been going over your file
and you two have a lot of expenses.

536
00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:30.365
If I'm not mistaken.
you got a car payment. medical bills.

537
00:24:30.448 --> 00:24:33.910
some credit card debt. and student loan?

538
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.537
-Yes. Pastor.

539
00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:38.040
I was in nursing school.
but I had to drop out.

540
00:24:40.042 --> 00:24:41.627
-Can y'all forgive me?

541
00:24:41.752 --> 00:24:44.087
Y'all look so young and healthy.

542
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.173
Look like you're able to work.

543
00:24:46.298 --> 00:24:48.217
Why are all your bills so far behind?

544
00:24:48.342 --> 00:24:55.140
-Our son. he had to have emergency surgery
and I got laid off nine months ago.

545
00:24:55.557 --> 00:24:59.018
I've been applying for jobs.
but no one wants to hire me.

546
00:24:59.937 --> 00:25:01.020
-Okay.

547
00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:03.690
Y’all got a lot of debt.

548
00:25:04.358 --> 00:25:07.443
I know y'all not expecting the church
to take care of all of this debt.

549
00:25:07.528 --> 00:25:08.737
-No. absolutely not. of course not.

550
00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:10.113
Whatever you can do is fine.

551
00:25:10.238 --> 00:25:11.240
Just anything you can do.

552
00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:15.785
-Unfortunately Mr. Landry
there’s not much that we can do.

553
00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:21.750
You see a church this size
has a lot of members that have financial burdens

554
00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:26.128
and we do the very bare minimum
for our tithing members.

555
00:25:30.383 --> 00:25:38.600
Now. if you look right here.
y'all have not paid tithes in over a year or an offering.

556
00:25:41.353 --> 00:25:44.855
-Like I told you before.
our son was hospitalized for five weeks.

557
00:25:45.607 --> 00:25:48.943
All right now. my insurance company
only covered 70% of the cost.

558
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.653
The rest was on us.

559
00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:53.198
-You were laid off.

560
00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:55.408
You got a severance?

561
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.160
-I had no extra income coming in to tithe from.

562
00:25:59.453 --> 00:26:02.040
-401(k). unemployment.

563
00:26:02.207 --> 00:26:05.293
Surely y'all had something
y'all could have given to the kingdom.

564
00:26:06.335 --> 00:26:09.172
-I'm sure the kingdom
would understand my situation.

565
00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:11.048
I'm sure God would understand this.

566
00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:14.928
-Let me make sure I'm understanding
what you're saying to me.

567
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.515
You won't take care of the kingdom.
but you want God to take care of your house?

568
00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:26.940
-Pastor. I don't know what other members do.

569
00:26:26.982 --> 00:26:31.695
but my family come before me giving
a donation to a multimillion-dollar church.

570
00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:35.157
I'm sorry. I couldn't contribute
to buying the Bishop a new Bentley.

571
00:26:35.282 --> 00:26:37.117
but I was trying to take care
of my family.

572
00:26:38.577 --> 00:26:40.953
-What we're not going to do is bash the Bishop.

573
00:26:43.748 --> 00:26:47.793
As a matter of fact.
it's the Bishop's reason why you are here today.

574
00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:52.633
He's decided to let me have a meeting
with you all out of his generosity

575
00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:55.010
so that’s not what we're going to do.

576
00:26:57.178 --> 00:27:01.767
Now this. and I'm sure Mr. Landry
you can understand. is a business.

577
00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:07.313
Because we're a business. we have a certain set
of rules and guidelines that we have to follow.

578
00:27:07.563 --> 00:27:08.398
-Set by who?
You?

579
00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:12.402
I'm sure Jesus didn't ask to see tithing reports
before he helped his people.

580
00:27:12.485 --> 00:27:13.653
You're servant. right?

581
00:27:13.695 --> 00:27:16.865
-Look. Mr. Landry. I understand your frustration.

582
00:27:16.907 --> 00:27:18.367
-No. you don't understand my frustration.

583
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.370
You have no clue. obviously.

584
00:27:22.953 --> 00:27:24.748
-I'll tell you what we're going to do.

585
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.167
Don't worry about this right now.

586
00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:30.087
Let's just take a few moments
and we're going to pray.

587
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.420
We're going to go to God and ask him for--

588
00:27:31.463 --> 00:27:32.005
-Pray?

589
00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.298
Pray for us?

590
00:27:33.882 --> 00:27:35.467
Prayer is not what we need right now.

591
00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:37.843
You know what?

592
00:27:37.968 --> 00:27:39.012
I made a mistake.

593
00:27:39.095 --> 00:27:39.930
Baby let's go.
-Mr. Landry.

594
00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:40.972
-Let's go baby.

595
00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:41.890
-Mr. Landry.

596
00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:42.557
-Baby. let's go.

597
00:27:43.808 --> 00:27:45.060
-Mrs. Landry. let--

598
00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:45.935
-I'm sorry.

599
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.150
Reginald. wait. wait.

600
00:27:57.988 --> 00:27:59.282
Are you okay?

601
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.118
-I'll be fine.

602
00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:04.788
-You know what you did back there
was not okay.

603
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.707
It's not his fault.

604
00:28:08.917 --> 00:28:09.750
-I know.

605
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.130
I'm sorry.

606
00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:14.505
Alright?

607
00:28:14.715 --> 00:28:15.965
I'm sorry for everything.

608
00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:19.468
-It's not your fault either.

609
00:28:19.468 --> 00:28:20.720
-It's my responsibility.

610
00:28:21.263 --> 00:28:22.973
Look. I got to find a way to save us.

611
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.683
-We don't need saving Reginald.

612
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.225
Look. God got us.

613
00:28:26.268 --> 00:28:27.018
We're going to be okay.

614
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.103
-No. that's my job.

615
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.855
-It's okay.

616
00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:30.605
-It's not okay.

617
00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:31.398
Stop saying that.

618
00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:35.068
Look. I'm sorry
for yelling at you. all right?

619
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.112
I need a minute.

620
00:28:37.153 --> 00:28:38.113
Go by your mom.

621
00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:39.655
-Reginald.

622
00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:40.490
-I need a minute.

623
00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:55.797
-Jessica.

624
00:28:58.633 --> 00:28:59.550
It's the third.

625
00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:02.053
-That means it's not the fifth.

626
00:29:03.013 --> 00:29:04.723
Get out and close the door behind you.

627
00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:07.933
-It's the third.

628
00:29:08.018 --> 00:29:08.727
-I know.

629
00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:18.068
-Ms. Clark.

630
00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:19.905
-Jason. I told you--

631
00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:21.782
-I'm not Jason.

632
00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:22.823
-Oh. I'm sorry.

633
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.243
Mr. Juniors. how are you doing today?

634
00:29:26.368 --> 00:29:27.287
-I'm great.

635
00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:29.163
I have some bad news about the house.

636
00:29:29.623 --> 00:29:30.790
Can I sit down?

637
00:29:32.708 --> 00:29:38.465
Listen. the toilet
in the master bathroom is broken.

638
00:29:38.673 --> 00:29:42.968
there's a leak in the roof.
and the AC unit needs to be repaired.

639
00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:44.303
-Damn.

640
00:29:44.428 --> 00:29:45.222
-I know.

641
00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:47.265
It's how it is opening up a new business.

642
00:29:48.183 --> 00:29:51.060
Luckily for you.
the leak and the toilet can be repaired easily.

643
00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:54.688
but Carmen has two kids
and she's definitely going to need a new AC unit.

644
00:29:55.815 --> 00:29:59.318
One of my clients is the air conditioner manufacturer
I had him come out

645
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.612
to the house and give me an estimate.

646
00:30:00.737 --> 00:30:03.615
He gave you a discount on a new unit.

647
00:30:03.698 --> 00:30:07.660
-Oh. you sure this is discounted?

648
00:30:07.785 --> 00:30:08.703
-Yes. Ma'am.

649
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.288
He even gave you 30% off.

650
00:30:10.913 --> 00:30:13.458
Now look. should I call him up and tell him
to go ahead on and install the unit?

651
00:30:13.542 --> 00:30:14.333
-No. no. no. no. no.

652
00:30:14.458 --> 00:30:16.878
Could you give me a few more days?

653
00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:17.878
-A few days?

654
00:30:18.547 --> 00:30:20.215
Jessica. Carmen is moving in tomorrow.

655
00:30:20.257 --> 00:30:23.968
-Yes. I know. but just let me pray about it
and then I'll just get back with you later.

656
00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:26.263
-Listen. Jessica. don't worry about it.

657
00:30:26.303 --> 00:30:27.097
I'll take care of it.

658
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.515
My client owes me a favor anyway.

659
00:30:29.808 --> 00:30:32.978
so what I have him do
is install the unit and bill you later.

660
00:30:33.143 --> 00:30:36.188
That way. it'll give you a few weeks
to come up with the money for the unit.

661
00:30:36.273 --> 00:30:36.730
All right?

662
00:30:36.815 --> 00:30:37.815
-Ah. yes.

663
00:30:37.898 --> 00:30:38.900
-See. I' fixed it.

664
00:30:38.942 --> 00:30:39.358
-Yes.

665
00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:39.985
-Problem solved.

666
00:30:40.025 --> 00:30:40.568
-No. no. no.

667
00:30:40.652 --> 00:30:42.070
Jesus fixed it.

668
00:30:42.195 --> 00:30:43.280
Not you. my friend.

669
00:30:43.363 --> 00:30:44.823
-Yes.
Okay.

670
00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:47.742
How is business going for you. Jessica?

671
00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.162
-After that news business is great.

672
00:30:51.328 --> 00:30:55.292
-Aside from the news.
how is business really going for Jessica?

673
00:30:57.377 --> 00:31:00.170
-Honestly it could be better.

674
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.173
-Did you do your research
on the market before you decide

675
00:31:03.173 --> 00:31:04.383
to open up a real estate business?

676
00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:06.010
-My father worked in real estate.

677
00:31:06.553 --> 00:31:09.848
He told me that there would be seasons
where sales peaked and seasons where they don't.

678
00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:12.517
-Well. the real estate business
hasn't peaked in years.

679
00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:15.895
Listen. I'm not trying
to discourage you or anything.

680
00:31:15.937 --> 00:31:16.187
-Really?

681
00:31:16.228 --> 00:31:17.522
Because I wasn't getting that.

682
00:31:17.688 --> 00:31:21.318
-Aside from being an investment broker.
I'm also a business consultant.

683
00:31:21.443 --> 00:31:23.570
I was just trying to give you something to think about.

684
00:31:24.695 --> 00:31:27.990
I have some books in my office.
I want you to read. I'll bring them by later.

685
00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:28.408
Okay?

686
00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:29.158
-Okay.

687
00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:29.950
-Awesome.

688
00:31:30.118 --> 00:31:33.580
Oh. and you know what I wanted
to tell you how professional your office looks.

689
00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:34.998
It looks very good in here.

690
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.707
-Thank you.

691
00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:40.378
Branding and graphic design
is what I did for five years before I got in real estate.

692
00:31:40.462 --> 00:31:41.003
-Really?

693
00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:41.545
-Yes.

694
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.007
-Do you think you could do something
like this to my office?

695
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.718
Maybe redesign my logo.
put some color on the wall.

696
00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.347
just give my office
a new character. you know.

697
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.768
-I'm sorry. did you just say paint your walls?

698
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.438
I don't paint for a living. I sell houses.

699
00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:01.190
If you want to add some color to your walls.

700
00:32:01.232 --> 00:32:03.610
you should just hire you a painter or something.

701
00:32:03.777 --> 00:32:04.778
-Oh. okay.

702
00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:06.695
Do you know someone?

703
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.198
Because I'm serious.
I really want to change the look in my office.

704
00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:10.200
-Yes. I do.

705
00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:11.283
I know his number.

706
00:32:11.368 --> 00:32:12.035
I could put him in.

707
00:32:12.077 --> 00:32:12.410
-Awesome.

708
00:32:12.493 --> 00:32:14.537
Put that number for it.

709
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.245
-Okay.

710
00:32:16.623 --> 00:32:18.540
-You sure you don't want
to put your touch on it?

711
00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:19.167
-Oh no.

712
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.627
It's not in my ministry.

713
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.380
-Okay.

714
00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:25.340
-Here you go.

715
00:32:25.548 --> 00:32:26.257
I put it in there.

716
00:32:26.257 --> 00:32:26.715
-Awesome.

717
00:32:26.758 --> 00:32:27.217
Awesome.

718
00:32:27.258 --> 00:32:28.677
Jose. okay. got you.

719
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.387
Thank you. Ms. Clark.

720
00:32:30.553 --> 00:32:31.137
-Oh yes.

721
00:32:31.178 --> 00:32:31.720
-I'll be in contact with you.

722
00:32:31.763 --> 00:32:32.347
-No problem.

723
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.722
-All right.

724
00:32:32.763 --> 00:32:33.765
-Thank you.

725
00:32:35.683 --> 00:32:36.225
[applause]

726
00:32:36.267 --> 00:32:36.725
-All right.

727
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.395
Now sit down. sit down. sit down.

728
00:32:40.647 --> 00:32:44.400
What I want everybody to do.
is I want you to take out a sheet of paper.

729
00:32:45.193 --> 00:32:50.573
I want you to write down something
you are believing God to manifest in your life.

730
00:32:51.157 --> 00:32:57.413
Now. this could be anything.
this could be increase in your financial situation.

731
00:32:57.538 --> 00:33:03.128
Maybe some healing. favor.
a mate. maybe a promotion on your job.

732
00:33:03.253 --> 00:33:05.338
Whatever you want.
I want you to write that down.

733
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.050
What I'm about to do is.
I'm about to show you in the Bible

734
00:33:10.175 --> 00:33:14.472
that God has already given you
exactly what you asked for.

735
00:33:15.015 --> 00:33:15.598
-Amen.

736
00:33:15.682 --> 00:33:17.975
-He's already given you exactly
what you've put down on that paper.

737
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.565
We have a part that we play.
and then God has this part that he plays.

738
00:33:24.565 --> 00:33:32.490
Our part is to make a prayer unto God.
decree it and pay that vow.

739
00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:37.370
Then God's part is to hear the prayer
that we've prayed. establish it.

740
00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:39.830
and shine his light upon our ways.

741
00:33:39.913 --> 00:33:42.708
The reason I had you write down
what you would believe in God for

742
00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:44.585
is because I want you to pray about it.

743
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.380
I want you to ask God for it.

744
00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:51.800
According to his word. listen.
he would have never put it in his word

745
00:33:51.843 --> 00:33:53.260
if he didn't want you to have it.

746
00:33:53.343 --> 00:33:54.720
Congregation: Amen.

747
00:33:54.763 --> 00:33:58.058
-This week. we going to ask God for some things.

748
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.312
and then next week
we're going to do the other part to this faith

749
00:34:02.312 --> 00:34:04.480
and we're going to pay that vow.

750
00:34:04.898 --> 00:34:10.360
Next week. I want you to come prepared
and bring a breakthrough seed

751
00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:14.532
and expect God to give you exactly
what you asked for.

752
00:34:14.573 --> 00:34:15.033
Amen.

753
00:34:15.115 --> 00:34:16.033
Congregation: Amen.

754
00:34:16.158 --> 00:34:16.993
-Amen.

755
00:34:17.827 --> 00:34:19.495
Bow your heads.
Let me pray for you.

[background conversation]

757
00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:22.707
-Jessica.

758
00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:25.293
-Hey. how you doing?

759
00:34:25.418 --> 00:34:25.793
-Listen.

760
00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:28.045
I want to thank you
for sending me to Mr. Junior.

761
00:34:28.128 --> 00:34:29.338
-Oh. no problem.

762
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:29.880
What did you-

763
00:34:29.923 --> 00:34:33.383
-That was the easiest $2.000 I've made in my life.

764
00:34:33.635 --> 00:34:34.343
-I'm sorry.

765
00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:36.763
Oh. did you say $2.000?

766
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:37.847
-Yes.

767
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:38.723
-Oh

768
00:34:39.473 --> 00:34:40.683
-God bless you.

769
00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:41.768
-Yes. no problem.

770
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:43.770
It's no problem.

771
00:34:43.812 --> 00:34:44.187
-Thank you.

772
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.895
-No problem.

773
00:34:44.895 --> 00:34:45.522
All right.

[music]

775
00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:56.407
-Hello?
May I help you?

776
00:34:58.368 --> 00:34:59.035
Excuse me.

777
00:34:59.077 --> 00:34:59.910
May I help you?

778
00:34:59.953 --> 00:35:01.328
-Oh. hi.

779
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.955
I'm sorry.

780
00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:03.623
I was just admiring your office.

781
00:35:03.748 --> 00:35:04.873
-Jessica.

782
00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:06.583
I thought I heard your voice.

783
00:35:07.293 --> 00:35:09.128
You like what Jose did to my office.

784
00:35:09.253 --> 00:35:12.715
-Why didn't you tell me the design job
was worth $2.000.

785
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.592
You know I could have used that money.

786
00:35:14.717 --> 00:35:17.470
-I asked you first miss.
"I don't paint walls.

787
00:35:17.595 --> 00:35:20.265
Why don't you go
and hire a professional."

788
00:35:20.348 --> 00:35:23.058
-Look. regardless.
I would've did a much better job.

789
00:35:23.893 --> 00:35:24.352
-Wow.

790
00:35:24.352 --> 00:35:25.270
You need to stop hating.

791
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.020
-I'm not hating.

792
00:35:27.147 --> 00:35:28.355
-Look. have a seat.

793
00:35:28.438 --> 00:35:29.482
-I don't want to sit down.

794
00:35:29.565 --> 00:35:32.318
-I have much better things to do
than to sit here and watch you pout.

795
00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:35.738
Even though it is kind of cute.

796
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.907
-I am not pouting. I'm pissed.

797
00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.450
You know you're wrong.

798
00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:43.120
-Listen. can we get Jose back on the line?

799
00:35:43.163 --> 00:35:47.542
I want to see if he wants to redesign my logo.
unless you want to do it.

800
00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:52.088
-Maybe.

801
00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:54.090
How much does it pay?

802
00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:55.633
-How much do you charge?

803
00:35:55.717 --> 00:35:58.720
-Oh. I am really expensive.

804
00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:03.183
Just email me the file
and what you want changed.

805
00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:06.185
-I'll have it to you
before you get back to your desk.

806
00:36:06.268 --> 00:36:06.768
-Thank you.

807
00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:11.648
-Watch my door. soft wood.

808
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.400
-Oops.

809
00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:12.983
-Soft.

810
00:36:18.948 --> 00:36:19.782
-Knock. knock.

811
00:36:20.408 --> 00:36:21.242
-Jessica.

812
00:36:21.325 --> 00:36:23.328
Look. let me give you
a call right back. okay?

813
00:36:25.245 --> 00:36:27.498
I didn't expect you back so soon.

814
00:36:27.582 --> 00:36:28.290
-Yes.

815
00:36:28.373 --> 00:36:29.500
I work pretty fast.

816
00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:33.087
-Stop the cap. you couldn't possibly
be finished with those logos already?

817
00:36:34.047 --> 00:36:36.840
-Here are three samples
I want you to take a look at

818
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.258
and make sure I'm on the right track.

819
00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:44.640
-Jessica. you have a real gift.

820
00:36:44.765 --> 00:36:48.895
-Yes. when I worked in corporate America.
I was their best designer.

821
00:36:49.728 --> 00:36:51.980
-Oh. so I bet you made that company
a lot of money. didn't you?

822
00:36:52.065 --> 00:36:54.275
Listen. how much do I owe you?

823
00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:57.820
-I don't know.

824
00:36:57.862 --> 00:36:59.322
I don't usually do those kinds of things.

825
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.865
-How much did you make on your job?

826
00:37:02.325 --> 00:37:07.830
-$15 an hour. and I worked on this
for four hours. so I guess you owe me $60.

827
00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:12.502
-Jessica. you're an entrepreneur
and you're still thinking like an employee.

828
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.588
Now. if your boss was able
to pay you $15 an hour.

829
00:37:15.713 --> 00:37:17.382
how much do you think he
or she was making?

830
00:37:18.508 --> 00:37:19.508
-I don't know.

831
00:37:19.592 --> 00:37:20.677
Double maybe?

832
00:37:20.843 --> 00:37:23.638
-Try triple. and that's on the low end.

833
00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:27.392
There's this little thing
on the internet called Google

834
00:37:27.517 --> 00:37:30.018
that you can check the going rate
for just about anything.

835
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.728
Hold up.

836
00:37:32.647 --> 00:37:38.903
Google says you should be
making about $62.50.

837
00:37:38.987 --> 00:37:40.028
-See. I was right

838
00:37:41.738 --> 00:37:42.573
-An hour.

839
00:37:42.657 --> 00:37:43.323
-Oh.

840
00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:45.910
-Jessica. you trouble me.

841
00:37:46.743 --> 00:37:47.328
-Why?

842
00:37:47.703 --> 00:37:49.122
-Because you know nothing about business.

843
00:37:49.247 --> 00:37:52.542
-I resent that.
I may not know much about compensation.

844
00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:54.918
but I know everything there is
to know about real estate.

845
00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:56.003
-I highly doubt that.

846
00:37:56.878 --> 00:37:57.672
-Try me.

847
00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:01.467
-How many properties
are under your company?

848
00:38:01.592 --> 00:38:02.468
-12.

849
00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:07.640
-I was a little nosy last week and I saw
that you had a property in the Waterford subdivision.

850
00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.642
How many square feet is that house?

851
00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:11.352
-I don't know.

852
00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:12.812
I don't have that listing in front of me.

853
00:38:12.978 --> 00:38:14.855
-What about the property tax.

854
00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:16.273
Are there any property tax in that area?

855
00:38:16.482 --> 00:38:18.067
-I'm not sure.

856
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.360
-Not sure.

857
00:38:19.735 --> 00:38:22.280
What about homeowners association fees?

858
00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:23.573
Are there any in that area?

859
00:38:23.698 --> 00:38:24.990
And if so. how much are they per year?

860
00:38:25.115 --> 00:38:25.825
-I don't know.

861
00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:27.952
I just told you I don't have
the listing in front of me.

862
00:38:27.993 --> 00:38:30.330
I can't answer those questions
off the top of my head.

863
00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:33.082
-You should be able to answer
those questions off the top of your head.

864
00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:34.750
because this is your business.

865
00:38:35.418 --> 00:38:38.755
Now. when you put that sign on the lawn
and that business suit and smiling.

866
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.923
you're telling the world
that I'm an expert at this property.

867
00:38:42.592 --> 00:38:45.762
If you seem uninformed or disorganized.

868
00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.888
people are going to take that business elsewhere.

869
00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:52.435
-I'm not disorganized.
I just don't know everything about every listing.

870
00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:54.395
That's what the iPad is for.

871
00:38:54.978 --> 00:38:55.938
-Check this out.

872
00:38:56.022 --> 00:38:59.442
My company is presently involved
in over 20 investment projects.

873
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.903
I can talk to you for about five minutes
about each of those projects.

874
00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:04.030
because I'm well informed.

875
00:39:04.363 --> 00:39:06.490
With only 12 listings under your company.

876
00:39:06.783 --> 00:39:09.410
there's no reason you should know
the basic information

877
00:39:09.493 --> 00:39:11.745
about those properties without the use of an iPad.

878
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.165
-Maybe one day I'll be on top
of my game like you.

879
00:39:15.248 --> 00:39:16.417
-That's if you survive.

880
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.628
-I will survive. because God
isn't going to let my business fail.

881
00:39:20.545 --> 00:39:23.048
If God. before me.
who could be against me?

882
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.593
-You Jessica.
you can be against yourself.

883
00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:30.598
Now the common denominator that determines
whether you succeed or fail

884
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.100
is not God's love. it's you.

885
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.105
I bet you don't even have
a business plan. right?

886
00:39:38.022 --> 00:39:39.023
-I sell houses.

887
00:39:39.065 --> 00:39:40.108
Why would I need a business plan?

888
00:39:40.233 --> 00:39:40.983
-Wow.

889
00:39:41.067 --> 00:39:45.488
-Look. I know that you may not believe
in God. but I'm a Christian.

890
00:39:45.988 --> 00:39:50.660
I am saved. sanctified. and a faithful member
of Abundant Life Cathedral.

891
00:39:51.953 --> 00:39:53.495
-That right there explains a lot.

892
00:39:53.578 --> 00:39:56.415
-I love my church and I love my pastor.

893
00:39:56.457 --> 00:39:58.960
so please don't speak negative
about them in my presence.

894
00:39:59.085 --> 00:40:02.463
-Look. bill me $250
for the logo design.

895
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:07.008
I'm going to need some business cards.
letterhead. and envelopes.

896
00:40:07.093 --> 00:40:07.968
-Okay.

897
00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:09.970
-Just send me an invoice for that as well.

898
00:40:10.053 --> 00:40:10.805
-Okay.

899
00:40:10.805 --> 00:40:12.140
-You have a nice day Ms. Clark.

900
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.682
-You too.

901
00:40:19.772 --> 00:40:21.065
[birds chipping]

902
00:40:24.693 --> 00:40:26.195
[phone ringing]

903
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.532
-You're not going to answer that?

904
00:40:29.698 --> 00:40:33.077
-No. and I transferred
all the money out of the accounts

905
00:40:33.202 --> 00:40:34.912
into one that he has no idea exist.

906
00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:38.748
I cancelled all these credit cards so yes.
don't try to play with me.

907
00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:39.917
-He's going to learn today.

908
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.878
-I meeting
with my attorney first thing in the morning.

909
00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:45.840
We're going to talk about
this lawsuit and this divorce.

910
00:40:46.632 --> 00:40:48.175
-Kelly. are you sure about this?

911
00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:49.302
-Yes. I'm sure.

912
00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:51.637
I mean. if he going to cheat
then he going to pay.

913
00:40:51.803 --> 00:40:55.098
-Yes. but maybe you should talk to him
or maybe you should hear him out

914
00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:55.808
Kelly: For what?

915
00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.602
I mean. I've seen everything I need to see.

916
00:40:57.685 --> 00:41:01.188
Ain't no coming back from this.
at least not for me.

917
00:41:01.772 --> 00:41:03.398
I mean. he think he can just-

918
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.443
-Mom. where's daddy?

919
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:06.527
-Hey sweet pea.

920
00:41:06.652 --> 00:41:07.987
-Hey aunty Rose.

921
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.363
-Come. you want to play a game?

922
00:41:09.447 --> 00:41:10.238
-Yes.

923
00:41:10.323 --> 00:41:11.908
-Okay. come. let's go.

924
00:41:16.995 --> 00:41:21.958
-I know that you're angry Kelly.
but what about the life that you've built?

925
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.043
What about your kids?

926
00:41:23.127 --> 00:41:25.588
Kelly: Look. I'm not about
to let John get away with it.

927
00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:27.380
-Have you thought about praying about it?

928
00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:31.010
I mean. do you really want
to ruin 10 years worth of marriage?

929
00:41:31.177 --> 00:41:32.970
Kelly: Look. you're supposed to be my friend.

930
00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:34.972
Why are you advocating for him?

931
00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:37.015
-No. I'm both of your friends.

932
00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:40.143
I just know how much
you two love each other.

933
00:41:42.103 --> 00:41:44.357
I just don't understand.

934
00:41:45.608 --> 00:41:48.693
You seem like the perfect couple
with the perfect life.

935
00:41:49.403 --> 00:41:52.073
I mean you both make six figures.

936
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.203
You have this beautiful home.
beautiful kids. luxury cars. and a killer wardrobe.

937
00:41:58.828 --> 00:42:02.165
I guarantee 90%
of your followers secretly hate you.

938
00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:05.835
One look at your life
and you make us all look like failures.

939
00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:16.222
-I'm real good at posting a dream.
but this right here. this is reality.

940
00:42:18.808 --> 00:42:24.522
Honestly. I haven't been
a wife to John in years.

941
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:36.242
My career. it came before my marriage.
before my children. even before God.

942
00:42:40.203 --> 00:42:50.548
John wanted the simple life.
I was the one who wanted to be rich.

943
00:42:52.592 --> 00:42:58.638
I wanted the material wealth
that Bishop preached about. that was me.

944
00:43:01.808 --> 00:43:06.522
It just seems like no matter how much money I made.
it was just never enough.

945
00:43:07.355 --> 00:43:10.025
I just kept taking on new projects.

946
00:43:10.108 --> 00:43:12.028
Exploring new business ventures.

947
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.158
I was never home to cater to
or care for John.

948
00:43:21.578 --> 00:43:23.538
I don't blame him for cheating.

949
00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:26.958
I just can't believe that he would.

950
00:43:28.502 --> 00:43:29.962
It's my fault.

951
00:43:30.128 --> 00:43:32.505
-No. listen to me.

952
00:43:32.632 --> 00:43:36.552
Listen. there is no excuse for infidelity

953
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.930
I just don't think that your marriage
is unrepairable.

954
00:43:41.557 --> 00:43:44.310
God can fix anything.

955
00:43:50.523 --> 00:43:52.360
-Can he fix my broken heart?

956
00:43:53.985 --> 00:43:55.780
[crying].

957
00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:07.708
How do I forgive him. I don't know.

958
00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:09.168
[crying]

959
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.690
-Hey. hey. hey.

960
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.360
-No

961
00:44:38.322 --> 00:44:39.240
-Damn.

962
00:44:43.868 --> 00:44:45.328
Goddamn.

963
00:44:45.995 --> 00:44:46.997
Damn it.

964
00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:49.125
-Daddy. why are they taking your car?

965
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:51.043
-Oh my God.

966
00:44:52.253 --> 00:44:53.878
It'll be all right son.

967
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.922
It'll be all right.

968
00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:57.425
-Jesus.

969
00:44:57.967 --> 00:45:01.095
-It's all right son.
get your sister go in the house.

970
00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:05.975
-Okay. this too shall pass.
we just have to have faith.

971
00:45:06.142 --> 00:45:07.268
-I know.

972
00:45:07.393 --> 00:45:09.103
I should go and console him.

973
00:45:09.185 --> 00:45:10.688
-No. you give him a moment.

974
00:45:11.397 --> 00:45:16.025
I know your first instinct is to run and console him.
but you give him some time. okay?

975
00:45:16.193 --> 00:45:18.070
-But I don't want him to think I'm angry.

976
00:45:18.153 --> 00:45:23.408
-Reginald knows that he has your support.
but I don't think that he knows that he has God's.

977
00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:30.665
He has been carrying his family on his shoulders.
now he is being forced to trust God.

978
00:45:33.252 --> 00:45:35.463
-I just wish there was something
I could do.

979
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:40.718
-You can pray for him baby
and ask God to give him a clear direction

980
00:45:40.843 --> 00:45:42.428
on what he should do with his family.

981
00:45:46.055 --> 00:45:47.057
Fix it Jesus.

982
00:45:47.098 --> 00:45:47.808
-[sobs]

983
00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:49.685
-I know sweetheart.

984
00:45:49.768 --> 00:45:50.268
I know.

985
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.855
Oh. fix it Jesus.

986
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.522
Fix it.

987
00:45:53.563 --> 00:45:54.230
Fix it.

988
00:45:54.398 --> 00:45:55.148
It's okay.

989
00:46:08.662 --> 00:46:13.875
-God. what do you want?

990
00:46:17.295 --> 00:46:21.717
I have two beautiful children
and the sweetest wife.

991
00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:27.055
I would be okay if it was just me.

992
00:46:29.265 --> 00:46:36.982
God. I have a family
and it's killing me to see them go without.

993
00:46:39.902 --> 00:46:42.070
I don't know what's going on.

994
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:47.743
I've been applying for jobs.
no one will hire me.

995
00:46:49.578 --> 00:46:53.998
I've lost everything we have.
everything.

996
00:46:57.085 --> 00:46:58.963
God. I need to know if you're real.

997
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.300
I need to know if you hear my prayers.

998
00:47:06.428 --> 00:47:11.350
I don't see you.
I haven't heard from you.

999
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.312
I don't even feel you moving in my life.

1000
00:47:21.943 --> 00:47:25.655
Do you even care that life is standing
on my neck and I can't breathe?

1001
00:47:27.783 --> 00:47:29.075
Don't you see me?

1002
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.008
I'm a loyal faithful husband
to my wife.

1003
00:47:57.313 --> 00:47:59.023
I'm not doing drugs or alcohol.

1004
00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:04.737
I live my life with good intentions
every day and this is what I get?

1005
00:48:05.945 --> 00:48:10.033
All I want to do is provide
for my family. that's it.

1006
00:48:14.955 --> 00:48:22.922
God. I can't do this alone.
I need your help.

1007
00:48:25.925 --> 00:48:26.717
Help me.

1008
00:48:29.887 --> 00:48:31.305
God. help my family.

1009
00:48:34.015 --> 00:48:39.520
God. please help us.

1010
00:48:40.773 --> 00:48:41.815
Please.

1011
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:52.033
-Now look. I know some of you are going
through some tough situations I get it.

1012
00:48:52.158 --> 00:48:56.622
but today
is a defining moment for you.

1013
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:03.170
Today is going to define
if you are trusting in God's word.

1014
00:49:03.878 --> 00:49:06.090
or you're trusting in the doctor's report.

1015
00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:08.342
Congregation: Amen.

1016
00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:11.387
-If you're walking in faith
or if you're walking in fear.

1017
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.975
Now. I'm not going to tell you what to give.
I'm not going to do that.

1018
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.560
I believe that's between you and God.

1019
00:49:18.602 --> 00:49:24.900
What I am going to say. is.
what you give needs to cost you something.

1020
00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:31.030
The widow woman gave her last meal.

1021
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.618
Abraham was willing
to sacrifice his son.

1022
00:49:35.785 --> 00:49:41.542
The woman with the alabaster box
was willing to give a year's salary.

1023
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.168
but that's not how their story ends.

1024
00:49:46.922 --> 00:49:52.385
They gave God their best
and then they experienced the overflow.

1025
00:49:52.468 --> 00:49:56.723
My question to all of you to here
is how bad do you want it?

1026
00:49:58.642 --> 00:50:03.105
How far are you willing to go
to experience the overflow?

1027
00:50:05.065 --> 00:50:10.903
Never hesitate to give God the best.
because He gave you his best

1028
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.365
when he sent you His Son Jesus Christ.

1029
00:50:17.285 --> 00:50:20.330
Abraham gave 1.000 burned offerings.

1030
00:50:21.915 --> 00:50:25.753
The widow woman gave her last might.

1031
00:50:27.795 --> 00:50:34.470
I'm not telling you what to give.
but make sure you make it count.

1032
00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:36.138
[applause]

1033
00:50:36.305 --> 00:50:39.725
-Michael. Wait.
can I talk to you for a minute?

1034
00:50:45.688 --> 00:50:46.982
-What is it?

1035
00:50:47.733 --> 00:50:51.612
-I know that the rent
for the house isn't due until the first.

1036
00:50:51.653 --> 00:50:53.905
but I was hoping
that your friend could pay me in advance

1037
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:55.490
because I really could use it.

1038
00:50:55.698 --> 00:50:57.993
-I'm not paying you anything for next month.

1039
00:50:58.577 --> 00:50:59.328
-Why?

1040
00:50:59.453 --> 00:51:02.330
-Because you didn't pay for the AC unit
like you said you would.

1041
00:51:02.498 --> 00:51:06.000
My client did a favor for you based
on the integrity of my word.

1042
00:51:06.752 --> 00:51:08.837
-Okay. I'm sorry. stop tripping.

1043
00:51:09.003 --> 00:51:09.922
-Stop tripping?

1044
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.092
-Jessica. you could have put
our business relationship in jeopardy.

1045
00:51:13.175 --> 00:51:14.343
and you act like you don't even care.

1046
00:51:14.468 --> 00:51:17.303
The money I paid you for the stationery alone
was more than enough

1047
00:51:17.387 --> 00:51:18.680
to take care of your responsibilities.

1048
00:51:19.348 --> 00:51:22.725
-Certain things in my life take priority
over other expenses.

1049
00:51:22.768 --> 00:51:24.310
I had to pay tithes.

1050
00:51:24.812 --> 00:51:27.480
-Okay. well. you still could have been able
to take care of your tithes

1051
00:51:27.563 --> 00:51:28.898
after you pay for that unit.

1052
00:51:29.148 --> 00:51:30.608
-Not after I paid my vow.

1053
00:51:31.235 --> 00:51:32.820
-Paid your what?

1054
00:51:32.945 --> 00:51:36.030
-It's a special offering I give
for my breakthrough.

1055
00:51:36.698 --> 00:51:41.703
Listen. I know that you are a sinner
and you can't understand why I give. but I do.

1056
00:51:41.828 --> 00:51:46.165
I truly believe in God's system and I know
that he's going to increase me financially.

1057
00:51:47.543 --> 00:51:50.087
-Why would God give you more money
when you're already a poor steward.

1058
00:51:50.212 --> 00:51:51.588
-That is not true.

1059
00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:52.380
-Oh. it's very true.

1060
00:51:52.505 --> 00:51:56.135
I don't even have to see your checkbook
to know that your whole life is out of balance.

1061
00:51:56.218 --> 00:51:57.635
-I am not out of balance.

1062
00:51:57.718 --> 00:52:01.180
I'm just doing things God's way.
it's just a matter of time.

1063
00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:04.350
-Well. Jessica you are out of time.
at least with me.

1064
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:07.855
-I'm about to lose my business.

1065
00:52:09.773 --> 00:52:11.608
I read all of the books that you gave me.

1066
00:52:11.692 --> 00:52:15.195
It said that every successful person
had a business mentor.

1067
00:52:15.863 --> 00:52:17.738
I was hoping that you can be my mentor.

1068
00:52:19.158 --> 00:52:20.117
-Mentor you?

1069
00:52:20.325 --> 00:52:22.578
[chuckles]
Not in this lifetime.

1070
00:52:22.703 --> 00:52:24.037
-Please. Michael.

1071
00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:26.205
I really need help.

1072
00:52:28.917 --> 00:52:30.460
-Jessica.
look if you want me to help you.

1073
00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:32.795
you're going to have to lose
your self-righteous attitude.

1074
00:52:33.005 --> 00:52:36.550
You cannot question my judgment.
and you're going to have to trust me enough

1075
00:52:36.758 --> 00:52:38.510
to do exactly what I tell you to do.

1076
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.388
-I basically be letting you run my life.

1077
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.223
I'm going to have to pray.

1078
00:52:44.308 --> 00:52:45.642
-See. that's your problem.

1079
00:52:45.767 --> 00:52:49.228
You keep trying to mix your religion
and business and it doesn't go together.

1080
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:53.900
Either we do this my way or you can continue
to do things the way you've been doing it.

1081
00:52:55.402 --> 00:52:56.778
Do we have an understanding?

1082
00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.657
-Yes. so. when did we officially start?

1083
00:53:00.823 --> 00:53:02.743
-7:00 AM. tomorrow morning?

1084
00:53:03.243 --> 00:53:04.785
-Jesus. why so early?

1085
00:53:04.912 --> 00:53:06.413
-Because we're going to a business seminar. okay?

1086
00:53:07.205 --> 00:53:09.917
And look. you're no longer
doing real estate.

1087
00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:11.168
-Wait. why?

1088
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.545
-Because number one. you suck at it.

1089
00:53:15.672 --> 00:53:17.590
Number two.
no one is buying houses right now.

1090
00:53:17.925 --> 00:53:22.387
Number three. you're running around
chasing money instead of your purpose.

1091
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.388
That's why you broke.

1092
00:53:25.348 --> 00:53:26.975
-What am I going to be doing?

1093
00:53:27.475 --> 00:53:30.770
-Everything you're good at.
graphic design and branding.

1094
00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:33.023
I'll see you in the morning.

1095
00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:36.777
[music]

1096
00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:53.000
-You wanted to see me?

1097
00:53:53.168 --> 00:53:54.962
-Yes. Jessica.

1098
00:53:56.797 --> 00:53:58.673
Come on in. have a seat.

1099
00:54:04.972 --> 00:54:06.473
I took a look at your finances.

1100
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:07.723
-And?

1101
00:54:08.392 --> 00:54:10.310
-It's the worst credit score
I've ever seen in my life.

1102
00:54:10.393 --> 00:54:11.978
I mean. a 420?

1103
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.898
You are in debt up to your eyeballs.

1104
00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.402
I don't know how you surviving out here.

1105
00:54:19.568 --> 00:54:21.905
-I do it by the grace of God.

1106
00:54:23.198 --> 00:54:25.158
-Look. I set up a new budget for you.

1107
00:54:25.783 --> 00:54:27.618
You're going to have
to cut back in every area.

1108
00:54:27.703 --> 00:54:29.663
especially the money you give to the church.

1109
00:54:29.745 --> 00:54:31.080
-No. wait a minute. Michael.

1110
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:34.167
I can't let you cut me off
from God's blessings.

1111
00:54:34.293 --> 00:54:37.087
I have to sow a seed
in order to receive my harvest.

1112
00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.173
What?

1113
00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:46.430
-It sounds like you were questioning my judgment.
which is a breach of your contract.

1114
00:54:47.805 --> 00:54:49.808
I was wondering if I needed
to tear this thing up.

1115
00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:50.517
-No. but Michael.

1116
00:54:51.852 --> 00:54:55.313
I'll take a look at the budget
and then I'll get back with you.

1117
00:54:59.525 --> 00:55:00.818
-How are things going out there?

1118
00:55:02.195 --> 00:55:07.575
-I've been to every business within
a two-block radius in every single office in this building.

1119
00:55:07.658 --> 00:55:08.702
-And?

1120
00:55:09.453 --> 00:55:13.290
-I've had a few people show interest.
but no one has signed the contract.

1121
00:55:13.748 --> 00:55:16.460
which is bad because their branding is horrible.

1122
00:55:16.543 --> 00:55:21.213
You should see their stuff. it's all faded
and cricket with cheap templates

1123
00:55:21.298 --> 00:55:22.883
and outdated stock images.

1124
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:27.637
If only they knew what I can do
for their business. they'd all be hiring me.

1125
00:55:28.388 --> 00:55:29.638
-Why don't you show them?

1126
00:55:30.348 --> 00:55:31.808
-What are you talking about?

1127
00:55:31.975 --> 00:55:33.977
-You go to a Presbyterian Church. right?

1128
00:55:34.518 --> 00:55:39.315
So you understand my next statement.
sow a seed.

1129
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.777
-I thought you said I had
to cut back on my giving.

1130
00:55:41.902 --> 00:55:45.197
-Take those brochures and those business cards
and redesign it for free.

1131
00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:47.990
-I can't do any work for free.

1132
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.827
I need money. you've seen my bank account.

1133
00:55:51.285 --> 00:55:54.205
-When successful businesses want consumers

1134
00:55:54.247 --> 00:55:56.958
to buy the new product
they give it to them for free.

1135
00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:59.127
by giving them all free samples.

1136
00:56:00.337 --> 00:56:01.630
You should do the same thing.

1137
00:56:01.797 --> 00:56:05.883
Create a before and after image
and then drop it off to their office.

1138
00:56:06.008 --> 00:56:07.593
or you can even email them.

1139
00:56:09.262 --> 00:56:13.350
-Okay. but what if I do all of that.
and I still don't utilize my services?

1140
00:56:13.475 --> 00:56:17.520
-It's a seed Jessica. I mean.
it may produce a harvest and it may not.

1141
00:56:17.895 --> 00:56:21.608
but you will never know it
until you sow it.

1142
00:56:21.733 --> 00:56:23.275
-Are you making fun of my church?

1143
00:56:23.443 --> 00:56:25.612
-No. I'm just trying
to expand your thinking. that's all.

1144
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.117
-You should expand your thinking
by coming to church [chuckles].

1145
00:56:30.325 --> 00:56:31.952
-What makes you think I don't go to church.

1146
00:56:32.077 --> 00:56:32.785
-Do you?

1147
00:56:32.993 --> 00:56:33.703
-Nope.

1148
00:56:33.995 --> 00:56:36.498
-I think that you would really love it.

1149
00:56:36.665 --> 00:56:39.543
Especially a progressive church
like Abundant Life.

1150
00:56:39.708 --> 00:56:41.795
-You are poking up the wrong tree Jessica.

1151
00:56:43.672 --> 00:56:47.508
-If I do the work.
and I get at least three new customers.

1152
00:56:47.592 --> 00:56:50.928
Will you come to the kingdom
Builders Conference with me next Saturday?

1153
00:56:51.053 --> 00:56:53.013
-No. not at all.

1154
00:56:53.055 --> 00:56:54.223
-You are just scared.

1155
00:56:54.348 --> 00:56:55.225
-Scared of what?

1156
00:56:55.558 --> 00:56:57.060
I just don't want to go to your church.

1157
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.355
-It's not at a church.
it's at a convention center.

1158
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.898
-God. you are so persistent.

1159
00:57:01.982 --> 00:57:03.190
Okay. check this out.

1160
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.735
If you can get five clients by Friday.

1161
00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:09.488
I'll consider going
to your little convention.

1162
00:57:09.613 --> 00:57:11.615
-I'm going to make you sign
a contract on that.

1163
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.660
but until you sign a contract.
we will just shake our hand.

1164
00:57:14.743 --> 00:57:16.830
-Unsanitized fingers right.

1165
00:57:16.872 --> 00:57:17.413
-Sorry.

1166
00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:18.540
-Yes. okay.

1167
00:57:18.623 --> 00:57:19.915
Now listen. don't you have work to do.

1168
00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:23.420
All right. get out of my office
and get to work.

1169
00:57:23.545 --> 00:57:25.338
-Yes. I do.

1170
00:57:25.422 --> 00:57:26.882
-Yes. get up out of here.

1171
00:57:27.007 --> 00:57:29.050
-Okay. I'll see you on Saturday.

1172
00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:31.720
[music]

1173
00:57:40.437 --> 00:57:40.937
-Hello.

1174
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.857
-I'm seeing you wearing that suit Saturday.

1175
00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:44.523
-For what?

1176
00:57:44.983 --> 00:57:46.400
Are you trying to take me out on a date?

1177
00:57:46.485 --> 00:57:47.818
God. I knew you wanted me.

1178
00:57:47.943 --> 00:57:49.988
-I just signed my sixth contract.

1179
00:57:50.113 --> 00:57:51.530
See you at the conference.

1180
00:57:51.573 --> 00:57:52.240
Bye.

1181
00:57:52.323 --> 00:57:54.283
[music]

1182
00:58:04.252 --> 00:58:05.795
[applause]

1183
00:58:10.883 --> 00:58:12.135
-You met budget?

1184
00:58:13.428 --> 00:58:17.057
-Not yet. but we believe will.

1185
00:58:17.182 --> 00:58:18.140
-Why believe.

1186
00:58:18.265 --> 00:58:19.808
Let's just make it happen.

1187
00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:27.275
You start and I'll finish and we'll just split whatever
is left after we meet budget.

1188
00:58:27.817 --> 00:58:28.985
You know what to do.

1189
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.695
The apostles taught you well.

1190
00:58:31.153 --> 00:58:32.988
[applause]

1191
00:58:44.543 --> 00:58:45.585
-Amen.

1192
00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:47.795
Amen.

1193
00:58:47.837 --> 00:58:52.675
Well. I have the honor
to introduce our keynote speaker

1194
00:58:53.343 --> 00:58:56.388
for this year's Kingdom Builders
Business Conference.

1195
00:58:56.638 --> 00:58:58.348
Dr. Travis Johnson.

1196
00:58:58.473 --> 00:59:00.267
[applause]

1197
00:59:03.687 --> 00:59:05.145
Oh. man. you know.

1198
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:10.652
Dr. Johnson has been a mentor
and father forgive me

1199
00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:13.822
ever since my father passed away.

1200
00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:20.078
He's given me insight
and vision that I've truly needed

1201
00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:23.873
to help my ministry grow.
and I'm so Godly grateful.

1202
00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:28.837
Before he speaks.
I want to do something special.

1203
00:59:29.462 --> 00:59:36.803
Dr. Johnson on behalf of Abundant Life Cathedral.
we want to present you with a check.

1204
00:59:37.345 --> 00:59:43.935
This check is for your faithfulness
to God and to this ministry

1205
00:59:44.102 --> 00:59:47.938
in the amount of $50.000.

1206
00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.440
[applause]

1207
00:59:55.655 --> 00:59:59.618
Now. I see I see some
of y'all looking at me. I do. and I hear you.

1208
00:59:59.658 --> 01:00:01.785
You say. "Why you got
to give him that much money.

1209
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:04.163
Why why do you have to sow that much into it?

1210
01:00:04.247 --> 01:00:05.248
He's already rich.

1211
01:00:05.332 --> 01:00:07.292
You could have given that to the poor."

1212
01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:07.958
-Yes.

1213
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:12.505
-As my father would say.
let me correct just think and thinking.

1214
01:00:13.423 --> 01:00:16.800
You see poor people
are poor for a reason.

1215
01:00:17.343 --> 01:00:18.470
Don't get me wrong.

1216
01:00:18.637 --> 01:00:23.308
I give to the poor.
but that's not my preference.

1217
01:00:24.267 --> 01:00:28.188
I'd rather sow into ground that is rich.

1218
01:00:28.313 --> 01:00:28.938
Amen.

1219
01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:29.480
-Amen.

1220
01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:30.773
[cheering]

1221
01:00:31.358 --> 01:00:34.485
-Listen. I've identified
where the blessing is resting.

1222
01:00:34.568 --> 01:00:35.028
-Yes.

1223
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.907
-I see where the anointing
is flowing and that's where I'm sowing.

1224
01:00:39.823 --> 01:00:46.247
The Bible says that if you sow into the prophet.
you shall then reap a prophet reward.

1225
01:00:46.498 --> 01:00:51.878
If I want to live on the level that doc
is living. I got to give.

1226
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.795
[applause]

1227
01:00:52.837 --> 01:00:54.005
-I need a new airplane.

1228
01:00:54.088 --> 01:00:55.923
I need a bigger house.

1229
01:00:56.007 --> 01:00:59.302
I need my ministry to grow. so I must-

1230
01:00:59.427 --> 01:01:00.345
-Sow.

1231
01:01:00.512 --> 01:01:01.470
-Come on. come on.

1232
01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:02.263
Come to me.

1233
01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:03.055
Come to me.

1234
01:01:03.138 --> 01:01:04.098
Come to me.

1235
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.350
[applause]

1236
01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:08.228
-I hear the spirit
of the Lord saying complete. complete somebody.

1237
01:01:08.268 --> 01:01:08.978
Shout. complete.

1238
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.603
-Complete.

1239
01:01:09.728 --> 01:01:10.813
-Say. complete.

1240
01:01:10.855 --> 01:01:11.730
-Complete.

1241
01:01:11.773 --> 01:01:16.778
-If you want God to bless you.
completely I dare you

1242
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.405
to put your money where your mouth is.

1243
01:01:18.488 --> 01:01:27.413
Since seven is the number of completion.
I dare you to sow a seed of $777.

1244
01:01:27.538 --> 01:01:28.330
-Oh.

1245
01:01:28.415 --> 01:01:31.668
-Oh. come on now don't do me like that.

1246
01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:32.627
Don't do me like that.

1247
01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:33.628
Don't get quiet on me.

1248
01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:35.170
Don't get quiet on me now.

1249
01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:40.510
This is not the time to be discouraged.
but the time to be encouraged.

1250
01:01:40.552 --> 01:01:43.345
God has set you up.

1251
01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:46.223
Especially if you are a business owner.

1252
01:01:46.515 --> 01:01:50.437
Dr. Johnson
has multiple successful businesses.

1253
01:01:53.188 --> 01:01:54.607
I hear the spirit of the Lord.

1254
01:01:54.773 --> 01:01:55.483
-Yes.

1255
01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:57.568
-Everybody lift your hands.

1256
01:01:57.735 --> 01:02:01.072
-Yes. yes. yes.
yes. yes. yes.

1257
01:02:04.117 --> 01:02:08.245
-Do you think
that he is here by chance?

1258
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.748
-No.

1259
01:02:09.913 --> 01:02:12.167
-God wants to bless you completely.

1260
01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:13.000
-Yes.

1261
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:13.710
Yes.

1262
01:02:13.877 --> 01:02:18.298
-If you want to get
in on the anointing that Dr. Johnson has on his life.

1263
01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:22.510
pull out your checkbooks
and get in on this.

1264
01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:23.303
Amen.

1265
01:02:23.385 --> 01:02:24.262
-Amen.

1266
01:02:24.303 --> 01:02:25.345
[cheering]

1267
01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:36.023
-Can I do $770.

1268
01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:37.065
-$777.

1269
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.775
-It's been low--

1270
01:02:37.817 --> 01:02:39.027
-777.

1271
01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:40.987
-Right here?

1272
01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.030
-777.

1273
01:02:42.863 --> 01:02:43.530
-Okay.

1274
01:02:44.783 --> 01:02:45.533
It's okay.

1275
01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:49.995
It's fine.

1276
01:02:50.038 --> 01:02:50.705
Thank you.

1277
01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:51.413
-777.

1278
01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:52.123
-I put it.

1279
01:02:52.207 --> 01:02:53.165
-Thank you.

1280
01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:54.458
All right.
Blessed the Lord.

1281
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.503
-Michael. what are you doing?

1282
01:02:56.543 --> 01:02:57.253
Are you crazy?

1283
01:02:57.337 --> 01:02:58.670
-Jessica. this is some bullshit. okay?

1284
01:02:58.755 --> 01:02:59.880
I'm out of here.

1285
01:02:59.923 --> 01:03:01.800
-Oh. but Johnson's going
to bless the business.

1286
01:03:01.883 --> 01:03:03.760
-Yes. brother. brother.

1287
01:03:03.843 --> 01:03:05.010
I see that we have an issue.

1288
01:03:05.053 --> 01:03:10.015
Listen. there's not going to be any walking
or moving during the offering.

1289
01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:10.933
Go ahead and have a seat.

1290
01:03:11.017 --> 01:03:11.600
Thank you.
-Are you serious?

1291
01:03:11.683 --> 01:03:13.060
I have to use the restroom.
man I'm pressed.

1292
01:03:13.102 --> 01:03:14.228
-Ah. yes. brother.

1293
01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:15.103
I'm still here.

1294
01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:18.817
Listen. look down. down. and focus.

1295
01:03:19.108 --> 01:03:23.530
There'll be no walking
or moving during the offering.

1296
01:03:23.822 --> 01:03:24.655
Let's go--

1297
01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:25.823
-You're going to shoot me in church?

1298
01:03:25.907 --> 01:03:26.698
-I've done it before.

1299
01:03:26.698 --> 01:03:27.992
Let's go ahead and have a seat.

1300
01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:28.910
Hallelujah.

1301
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.622
-Brother. brother.

1302
01:03:32.705 --> 01:03:33.288
Excuse me.

1303
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:33.790
-What?

1304
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:34.082
-Man?

1305
01:03:34.123 --> 01:03:35.250
You have a serious attitude problem.

1306
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:37.293
Where's the money
you took off that offering plate.

1307
01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:39.712
-Now you're following me behind
this foolishness right here.

1308
01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:40.380
-No. no. no no. no.

1309
01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:40.755
-Where's the info?

1310
01:03:40.838 --> 01:03:41.463
I need the info brother.

1311
01:03:41.505 --> 01:03:41.840
-It's okay.

1312
01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.715
Look. look it's the--

1313
01:03:42.757 --> 01:03:43.383
-Jessica what are you--

1314
01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:43.715
-Thank you.

1315
01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:44.092
Thank you.

1316
01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:44.633
-It's the full.

1317
01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:49.180
-What are you doing?

1318
01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:52.183
-Look. I appreciate you helping my business.

1319
01:03:52.267 --> 01:03:54.352
but my offerings have
to do with my beliefs.

1320
01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:56.145
I can't let you interfere with that.

1321
01:03:56.187 --> 01:03:57.355
-Jessica. I'm trying to help you.

1322
01:03:57.438 --> 01:03:59.607
-Help me by respecting my faith.

1323
01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.900
-Your car payment is three months behind.

1324
01:04:02.025 --> 01:04:05.405
the rent for the office is late
and your lights are about to get cut off.

1325
01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:06.655
You cannot afford to give.

1326
01:04:06.655 --> 01:04:07.948
-I cannot afford not to give.

1327
01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:09.825
I make my living through my giving.

1328
01:04:09.868 --> 01:04:11.202
-You make your living through your gift.

1329
01:04:11.493 --> 01:04:13.495
and right now you have
too much financial responsibility

1330
01:04:13.663 --> 01:04:14.873
to be giving your money away.

1331
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.208
-I'm not giving it away.

1332
01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:21.503
Dr. Johnson
has a special anointing that is going

1333
01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:24.632
to help our businesses grow.
and I have to sow into him.

1334
01:04:25.258 --> 01:04:28.510
-Listen. if you work hard
and build your brand.

1335
01:04:28.595 --> 01:04:31.430
your business will grow.
but you rather buy a blessing

1336
01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:34.433
from a counterfeit profit who's anointing
I'm sure you want nothing to do with.

1337
01:04:34.558 --> 01:04:37.395
Who are you to think you can buy a gift
from God with money?

1338
01:04:37.478 --> 01:04:38.813
-It's not like that.

1339
01:04:39.105 --> 01:04:44.277
When we sow into him. he is going to pray
and ask God to bless our business.

1340
01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.780
-You're paying him to pray for you?

1341
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:51.450
Jessica. are you really that naive?

1342
01:04:51.533 --> 01:04:52.075
-Oh God.

1343
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.285
It is not like that.

1344
01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:54.995
It's not like he's stealing our money.

1345
01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:57.665
-He doesn't have to steal it
if you're giving it to him.

1346
01:05:02.337 --> 01:05:03.212
No problem.

1347
01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:04.755
I'll be able to pick up the kids shortly.

1348
01:05:05.798 --> 01:05:06.507
All right.

1349
01:05:21.105 --> 01:05:21.480
[grants]

1350
01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:23.398
-Oh God. please help me.

1351
01:05:30.657 --> 01:05:32.450
[door knock]

1352
01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:41.668
-Who is it?

1353
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.502
-It's Michael.

1354
01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.800
-Michael. what are you doing here?

1355
01:05:50.718 --> 01:05:52.512
-You haven't been to the office all week.

1356
01:05:53.428 --> 01:05:55.180
-I've been working from home.

1357
01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:00.728
-You working from home have anything to do
with this eviction notice?

1358
01:06:02.605 --> 01:06:03.730
-Jesus.

1359
01:06:05.273 --> 01:06:08.485
Well. they put it on the front door
so that way everybody can see it.

1360
01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:23.458
-This is where you live?

1361
01:06:23.543 --> 01:06:24.460
-I didn't invite you in.

1362
01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:25.712
-Oh. you didn't have to.

1363
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:30.925
No lights.

1364
01:06:32.218 --> 01:06:32.927
It figures.

1365
01:06:32.968 --> 01:06:35.888
-You know what. Michael.
if you're coming over here to tell me. "I told you so".

1366
01:06:35.972 --> 01:06:37.932
I really don't want to hear that
from you right now.

1367
01:06:38.683 --> 01:06:40.308
You promised that you would help me.

1368
01:06:40.393 --> 01:06:40.768
-Yes.

1369
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.478
You promised that you would listen.
but you didn't.

1370
01:06:43.353 --> 01:06:44.980
These candles are the result of that.

1371
01:06:46.065 --> 01:06:48.275
-God is just testing my faith.

1372
01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:49.485
-This is not God's fault.

1373
01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.237
It's yours.

1374
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.530
God already provided you
with everything you needed

1375
01:06:53.613 --> 01:06:56.658
to take care of your responsibilities.
but you gave it away.

1376
01:06:57.868 --> 01:06:59.620
-I don't want to hear that from you.

1377
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:03.040
If I have to suffer for righteousness' sake.
then so be it.

1378
01:07:03.123 --> 01:07:05.168
-You're suffering
because of your poor choices.

1379
01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:09.213
-I don't care about
what you say because in the end.

1380
01:07:09.255 --> 01:07:11.423
God is going to get the glory out of all of this.

1381
01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:11.798
-Wait a minute.

1382
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.093
Do you think God is glorified
by you sitting in the dark.

1383
01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:17.805
kicked out of your office.
and drowning in debt?

1384
01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:20.933
What kind of testimony
are you of His faithfulness?

1385
01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:21.933
-I don't know.

1386
01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:25.353
I do everything that he asks me to do.

1387
01:07:25.438 --> 01:07:29.192
I pray. I fast. I serve at the church.
I pay my tithes.

1388
01:07:29.275 --> 01:07:31.318
He just refuses to bless me.

1389
01:07:36.198 --> 01:07:38.575
-Jessica. it just sounds
like you're upset with God.

1390
01:07:41.828 --> 01:07:49.420
Listen. it's just that your heart
and motive for prosperity is in the wrong place.

1391
01:07:49.545 --> 01:07:51.130
-How can you say that?

1392
01:07:51.963 --> 01:07:53.758
You can't see what's in my heart.

1393
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.343
-I don't have to see what's in your heart.

1394
01:07:56.468 --> 01:08:00.640
I see your actions.
but it's not entirely your fault.

1395
01:08:00.807 --> 01:08:03.558
It's just the way the prosperity message
has been taught to you.

1396
01:08:03.643 --> 01:08:08.063
-I am so tired of unbelievers talking
about preachers who preach about money.

1397
01:08:08.147 --> 01:08:10.358
Prosperity is all over the Bible.

1398
01:08:10.398 --> 01:08:10.942
-You're right.

1399
01:08:10.983 --> 01:08:12.150
You're absolutely right.

1400
01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:15.613
Prosperity is all over the Bible.
but somewhere along the way.

1401
01:08:15.695 --> 01:08:17.615
the prosperity message has been perverted.

1402
01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:21.577
You see the perversion is in the pews.
even more than the pulpit.

1403
01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:26.582
but it's the people and the pews
who flood the alters with money.

1404
01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:28.918
trying to buy blessings
and purchase promises.

1405
01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.630
-I give because I have bills
and I need God to bless me.

1406
01:08:32.713 --> 01:08:33.548
-Exactly.

1407
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.052
You don't give to get something in return.

1408
01:08:38.177 --> 01:08:40.930
out of fear of some curse
or out of your necessities.

1409
01:08:41.138 --> 01:08:41.973
-Necessities?

1410
01:08:42.013 --> 01:08:43.348
-Your needs. Jessica.

1411
01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:46.727
You don't take your light bill money
and pay your tithes with it.

1412
01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:51.273
God loves a cheerful giver.
and how could you be cheerful

1413
01:08:51.315 --> 01:08:52.942
about giving away something that you need?

1414
01:08:58.363 --> 01:09:00.867
-What about seeking first the kingdom of God?

1415
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:05.580
When they did that.
God makes them rich. Michael.

1416
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.957
He made Solomon a billionaire.

1417
01:09:07.998 --> 01:09:09.750
-Okay. but why did
he make Solomon a billionaire?

1418
01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:14.172
Was it because it was a good idea or was it

1419
01:09:14.213 --> 01:09:16.090
because being a billionaire
was a part of his purpose.

1420
01:09:16.215 --> 01:09:20.052
How else would he be able
to build the kingdom if he didn't have billions?

1421
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:23.472
God does everything for a reason.

1422
01:09:24.348 --> 01:09:27.268
You seek first. the kingdom of God.
because of your love for Him

1423
01:09:28.018 --> 01:09:29.728
not because of what He can add to you.

1424
01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:35.943
-I can't accept that
because I have been through too much.

1425
01:09:36.277 --> 01:09:39.447
I have sacrificed too much for it
to just all be a lie.

1426
01:09:40.405 --> 01:09:42.033
It says. so right here.

1427
01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:45.995
It says that wealth and riches--

1428
01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:48.748
-Wait. listen. listen. do you even love God

1429
01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.128
or do you just love what he can do for you?

1430
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.467
Jessica. listen.

1431
01:09:59.925 --> 01:10:02.470
It's God's will for you to prosper
and have nice things.

1432
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.223
you just have a lot of growing up to do.

1433

1435
01:10:20.028 --> 01:10:22.280
Mr. Nelson what's going on. bigtime.

1436
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:26.077
Listen. I was coming to see you today
to pay the rent for Jessica Clark's realty.

1437
01:10:27.078 --> 01:10:29.497
-Mr. Juniors?

1438
01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.080
-Correct.

1439
01:10:30.248 --> 01:10:33.458
-Jessica is an adult. man
she can take care of her own responsibilities.

1440
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:36.963
-That's cool.
but she doesn't have to this month.

1441
01:10:38.547 --> 01:10:40.383
This is for you. man.

1442
01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:51.227
-You didn't have to do that.

1443
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.940
-Yes. I did.

1444
01:10:57.942 --> 01:10:58.733
-Thank you.

1445
01:11:00.193 --> 01:11:01.070
-You're welcome.

1446
01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:03.322
-I love Him.

1447
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:08.368
I really do love God.
not just what he can do for me.

1448
01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:11.663
-I already knew that.

1449
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:15.625
-Why didn't you tell me
you were a Christian?

1450
01:11:15.835 --> 01:11:16.418
-See. look.

1451
01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.920
There you go. assuming again.

1452
01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:21.465
-Why are you being so nice to me?

1453
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.217
-Because I know where you're at. Jessica

1454
01:11:24.093 --> 01:11:26.303
and I don't want you
to make the same mistakes I did.

1455
01:11:28.597 --> 01:11:29.640
Listen. do you have a minute?

1456
01:11:31.142 --> 01:11:31.933
-Yes.

1457
01:11:32.685 --> 01:11:34.060
-Good.
Come take a ride with me.

1458
01:11:47.908 --> 01:11:48.908
I used to live here.

1459
01:11:50.828 --> 01:11:52.538
-No way you used to be homeless.

1460
01:11:53.788 --> 01:11:55.373
-Yes. ma'am. I sure was.

1461
01:11:56.750 --> 01:12:03.465
When I got here. I was depressed.
suicidal. I was just angry with God.

1462
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.968
-Why was that?

1463
01:12:06.635 --> 01:12:10.680
-I gave my heart and soul.
everything I had into the ministry.

1464
01:12:10.805 --> 01:12:15.185
I still ended up with nothing
but the director of this shelter.

1465
01:12:15.643 --> 01:12:19.315
he prayed with me and ministered
to my life every single day

1466
01:12:19.815 --> 01:12:21.233
and I'll never forget that.

1467
01:12:22.525 --> 01:12:26.155
In return for his kindness.
I'm going to write a grant to reopen this shelter.

1468
01:12:27.113 --> 01:12:28.783
-Where did you learn to write grants?

1469
01:12:29.325 --> 01:12:33.662
-Well. I have a master's degree in business
and finance and even though I was broke.

1470
01:12:33.662 --> 01:12:36.665
and homeless at the time.
I still knew how to make money.

1471
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:41.503
After a few short months of planning
I opened my own investment business.

1472
01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:47.675
and shortly thereafter. I had major.
major investors added to my group.

1473
01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:53.598
Here I was. a former homeless man
and I had multimillionaires entrusting me

1474
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.517
with that money.

1475
01:12:54.642 --> 01:12:57.853
I couldn't think for the life of me.
why this was happening for me.

1476
01:12:57.937 --> 01:13:01.648
I wasn't in the church. I wasn't tithing.

1477
01:13:02.315 --> 01:13:05.277
I didn't even ask God
for anything but He gave me everything.

1478
01:13:05.443 --> 01:13:06.528
-Wow.

1479
01:13:06.612 --> 01:13:09.155
-I had unknowingly fell into God's Grace.

1480
01:13:09.782 --> 01:13:12.618
I could do nothing
but give him all the praise and glory.

1481
01:13:12.743 --> 01:13:13.910
-Wow.

1482
01:13:14.578 --> 01:13:17.790
I can only imagine and hope
that something like that to happen to me.

1483
01:13:17.873 --> 01:13:20.750
-Now it can. after I reprogram you.

1484
01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:22.085
-Reprogram?

1485
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:22.962
-Oh. yes.

1486
01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:25.213
You got some bugs in your system.
and it's bugging me.

1487
01:13:25.338 --> 01:13:28.175
but now I'm going to get you right.

1488
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.677
Believe that.

1489
01:13:31.887 --> 01:13:33.138
Let's get out of here.

1490
01:13:33.263 --> 01:13:35.473
Now. money doesn't have
a moral conscience.

1491
01:13:35.558 --> 01:13:38.102
it simply flows into
the hands of whoever's attracting it.

1492
01:13:38.268 --> 01:13:42.398
You can be a teacher. or a prostitute.
a drug dealer.

1493
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.775
or a priest.
Megan Thee Stallion or Meagan Good.

1494
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.153
it doesn't matter.

1495
01:13:47.278 --> 01:13:49.572
as long as you're doing
what it takes to attract money it will come.

1496
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.660
Now. being a Christian doesn't exempt you
from experiencing hard times. that's just life.

1497
01:13:56.578 --> 01:14:00.290
Systemic racism doesn't prevent you
from experiencing the promised blessings of God.

1498
01:14:00.415 --> 01:14:05.545
that's an excuse. and contrary
to whatever these prosperity pastors say.

1499
01:14:05.838 --> 01:14:09.717
being the righteousness
of God does not entitle you to wealth and riches.

1500
01:14:09.883 --> 01:14:12.678
-I thought the Bible says
that God blesses the righteous.

1501
01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:15.473
-Well. an empowerment
is different from an entitlement.

1502
01:14:15.598 --> 01:14:18.017
The blessing is an empowerment
for you to prosper

1503
01:14:18.183 --> 01:14:19.893
but you still have to attract money to you.

1504
01:14:20.352 --> 01:14:22.228
How do we attract money to us. Jessica?

1505
01:14:22.313 --> 01:14:27.067
-Oh. by saying.
"Money come to me. now." It comes.

1506
01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:29.153
-I wish I could punch you in the face right now.

1507
01:14:30.403 --> 01:14:31.155
God.

1508
01:14:31.238 --> 01:14:36.868
Listen. working. investing.
producing. creating. buying.

1509
01:14:36.993 --> 01:14:40.163
selling and trading are all natural elements
that bring money into your hands.

1510
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:45.585
Now. praying. fasting. giving.
living holy. confessing. meditating.

1511
01:14:45.668 --> 01:14:48.172
and reading God's words
should all go into conjunction

1512
01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:49.965
with the natural elements of making money.

1513
01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:52.383
Now. do you understand?

1514
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.385
-Yes. I got it.

1515
01:14:54.595 --> 01:14:55.428
-Good.

1516
01:14:55.553 --> 01:14:56.930

Jessica. the key to achieving anything
you want in life is summed up in one word. faith.

1525
01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:26.085
Get in faith and stay there.

1526

and I need you to stay focused.

01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:39.992
We seem to hit
a little bump in the road.

1555
01:16:40.033 --> 01:16:41.785
and we need an additional partner to come in

1556
01:16:41.827 --> 01:16:44.455
and give us the leverage we need
to continue our building process.

1557
01:16:45.372 --> 01:16:49.668
We believe.
we feel that Junior Investment Group

1558
01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:50.960
could be the missing component to that

1559
01:16:51.085 --> 01:16:54.882
and we're willing to give you
an equal partnership share of 20%.

1560
01:16:56.175 --> 01:16:56.800
-Okay.

1561
01:16:56.842 --> 01:16:59.178
Well. excuse me. I'm looking over these files.

1562
01:16:59.218 --> 01:17:02.805
but I'm not familiar
with any of you guys' business.

1563
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:04.475
What line of work do you guys do?

1564
01:17:04.558 --> 01:17:05.600
-Nonprofit.

1565
01:17:05.725 --> 01:17:07.185
We're all in the people business.

1566
01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:12.690
-I see ALC Investments here.
is that a nonprofit as well?

1567
01:17:12.815 --> 01:17:18.113
-ALC is actually Mr. Ayers's investment company
and it's actually one

1568
01:17:18.197 --> 01:17:19.615
of the largest in our organization.

1569
01:17:19.698 --> 01:17:23.618
-Okay. so ALC is an acronym I suppose.

1570
01:17:24.078 --> 01:17:25.495
What does ALC stand for?

1571
01:17:25.537 --> 01:17:28.665
-ALC stands
for Abundant Life Cathedral.

1572
01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:30.375
-A church.

1573
01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:32.210
Okay.

1574
01:17:32.252 --> 01:17:39.258
A church is supporting
the building of a mall and a hotel?

1575
01:17:39.425 --> 01:17:43.263
-Not the church.
but ALC Investments.

1576
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.475
-Is ALC Investments supported
by the church

1577
01:17:47.558 --> 01:17:49.395
or is the church supported by ALC investments?

1578
01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.105
-Supported--

1579
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.648
-Financially supported.

1580
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:57.277
-Oh. ALC Investments
is supported by our church.

1581
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.825
-Is the church aware
of your business ventures?

1582
01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:05.452
-We are all senior pastors. Mr. Junior.

1583
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:09.580
and where our how our businesses
are funded. does it really matter?

1584
01:18:09.707 --> 01:18:12.208
-Well. obviously it does.
or I wouldn't be asking.

1585
01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:12.793
-Okay.

1586
01:18:14.753 --> 01:18:19.717
Miss Dillon. Gentlemen.
would y'll mind giving Mr. Junior and I a second. please?

1587
01:18:21.135 --> 01:18:22.553
-Mr. Junior. is something wrong?

1588
01:18:22.635 --> 01:18:23.470
-Well. actually--

1589
01:18:23.553 --> 01:18:28.850
-I think that Mr. Junior just needs to see
a clear separation between church and business.

1590
01:18:29.017 --> 01:18:34.355
I'd like to share that with him in detail. privately.

1591
01:18:35.065 --> 01:18:35.607
-Yes sir.

1592
01:18:41.655 --> 01:18:50.497
-[exhales] Mr. Junior.

1593
01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.793
Is what you're calling yourself these days?

1594
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.630
What exactly do you want?

1595
01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:01.258
-I don't want anything.

1596
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.218
Your business partner's initiating me
into this merger.

1597
01:19:04.303 --> 01:19:09.223
-Well. I definitely didn't know
the MAJunior Investment was you.

1598
01:19:09.223 --> 01:19:09.975
that's for sure.

1599
01:19:09.975 --> 01:19:11.058
-Well. now you know.

1600
01:19:11.685 --> 01:19:12.643
How can I help you?

1601
01:19:12.685 --> 01:19:15.855
-Well. you can start by putting
your personal feelings aside

1602
01:19:15.938 --> 01:19:18.150
and making a very wise business decision.

1603
01:19:18.275 --> 01:19:19.443
-It's not that wise.

1604
01:19:20.235 --> 01:19:23.322
There's a reason why builders
decided not to build in this location.

1605
01:19:23.405 --> 01:19:27.868
-It's a risk but with any investment.
there's going to be risk.

1606
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:30.328
-Well. yes. I take risks with people that I trust.

1607
01:19:30.788 --> 01:19:32.705
certainly not you and your wolfpack.

1608
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:33.915
-What's your number?

1609
01:19:34.082 --> 01:19:35.542
How much is it going to cost?

1610
01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:37.168
I'm guessing 20% is not enough for you.

1611
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.923
-I can't be bought and I definitely
don't accept stolen money.

1612
01:19:41.965 --> 01:19:42.673
-Stolen?

1613
01:19:43.883 --> 01:19:46.762
That money was given to us by our ministries.

1614
01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:49.138
-Yes. by people who thought
they were giving it to God.

1615
01:19:49.223 --> 01:19:50.848
or at least something to do with God.

1616
01:19:51.308 --> 01:19:53.477
Certainly not a shopping mall or a hotel.

1617
01:19:53.518 --> 01:19:57.523
-Listen. I've got millions
of dollars tied into this project

1618
01:19:57.523 --> 01:19:59.900
and I'm not about to let you ruin it
because you're jealous.

1619
01:19:59.942 --> 01:20:00.400
-Jealous?

1620
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.318
Jealous of what?

1621
01:20:03.278 --> 01:20:04.445
Certainly not you.

1622
01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:07.740
-Why not?

1623
01:20:10.577 --> 01:20:12.870
Everything I own belongs to you.

1624
01:20:14.832 --> 01:20:21.255
Oh. you forget. you were called
to pastor Abundant Life. not me.

1625
01:20:22.548 --> 01:20:26.635
Daddy put you away
then I inherited your dream.

1626
01:20:26.677 --> 01:20:27.468
-Put away?

1627
01:20:27.803 --> 01:20:28.970
I walked away.

1628
01:20:29.428 --> 01:20:32.808
I wanted nothing to do with that garbage
that dad was pushing off on those people. man.

1629
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:34.518
-Come on. Michael it's not garbage.

1630
01:20:35.727 --> 01:20:38.020
Faith and prosperity
have always been the vision

1631
01:20:38.063 --> 01:20:39.773
and foundation
of this ministry you know that?

1632
01:20:39.898 --> 01:20:43.150
-Yes. but I remember
when it was love. loving God.

1633
01:20:43.235 --> 01:20:45.988
loving God's people.
and ministering to their needs.

1634
01:20:46.445 --> 01:20:48.030
Then all of that changed. man.

1635
01:20:48.073 --> 01:20:49.323
-Yes. you're right.

1636
01:20:49.448 --> 01:20:53.328
Let's see daddy started teaching prosperity.
people started giving.

1637
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:57.665
he was able to keep food on the table.
keep the lights on. clothes on our backs.

1638
01:20:57.748 --> 01:21:01.043
Teaching prosperity
changed the quality of our life.

1639
01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:03.463
-It certainly changed
the quality of your life. didn't it?

1640
01:21:04.088 --> 01:21:10.137
Mr. two mansions. a helicopter.
a private jet. and a whole fleet of foreign cars.

1641
01:21:12.513 --> 01:21:14.098
-Michael. Michael. Michael.

1642
01:21:14.223 --> 01:21:19.020
Is it not God's will
for His children to be blessed?

1643
01:21:19.145 --> 01:21:23.025
-You're telling me that all of your members
are going to live lavishly like you do?

1644
01:21:23.108 --> 01:21:23.608
-No.

1645
01:21:24.525 --> 01:21:27.278
Prosperity is like salvation. okay?

1646
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.657
It's available for all
but not all are going to receive it.

1647
01:21:30.698 --> 01:21:32.868
-Well stop telling them
that they're all going to be rich.

1648
01:21:33.785 --> 01:21:36.330
Stop having them sow seeds
for millions. mansions.

1649
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:38.415
and Mercedes when you know half of them
won't even see it.

1650
01:21:38.498 --> 01:21:38.957
-Okay.

1651
01:21:38.998 --> 01:21:40.375
-Stop. man. just stop.

1652
01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:43.253
Stop having them give money
to you believing

1653
01:21:43.295 --> 01:21:44.755
that they're going to live life at your level.

1654
01:21:45.588 --> 01:21:48.425
When most of them don't even
have the influence that you do.

1655
01:21:48.633 --> 01:21:51.428
How many of your members
can stand in front of a crowd of people

1656
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:53.138
and raise thousands of dollars
in minutes in minutes?

1657
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:58.477
-When people step out on faith and give.
they put that in God's hand.

1658
01:21:58.518 --> 01:22:01.647
He sees that.
and He blesses them accordingly.

1659
01:22:01.647 --> 01:22:02.773
God can do anything.

1660
01:22:02.773 --> 01:22:04.398
-Yes. anything but violate His word.

1661
01:22:05.108 --> 01:22:09.278
Man. you got more whores. hostiles.
and homosexuals in your church than in the club.

1662
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:13.240
They all pay their tithes. huh?

1663
01:22:14.533 --> 01:22:16.620
As if the money can put them
in a right standing with God.

1664
01:22:16.703 --> 01:22:18.788
-I don't control the sin in their lives.

1665
01:22:20.748 --> 01:22:22.875
I don't know what's
in their heart when they give.

1666
01:22:25.545 --> 01:22:26.880
-Do you even care?

1667
01:22:28.548 --> 01:22:32.468
Are you concerned that they have ill motives
and hidden agendas when they give?

1668
01:22:32.593 --> 01:22:35.930
-Look I got members in my church
that are very. very successful.

1669
01:22:35.973 --> 01:22:39.350
Some of them have more money than me.

1670
01:22:39.433 --> 01:22:41.143
-That's a select few. Abraham.

1671
01:22:41.895 --> 01:22:44.690
Most of them have regular jobs
with regular salaries.

1672
01:22:44.773 --> 01:22:47.233
who know nothing about economics
and how to make their money work for them.

1673
01:22:47.275 --> 01:22:48.693
-That's not my assignment.

1674
01:22:49.277 --> 01:22:55.575
My job is to preach the Word.
I'm not responsible for their level of education.

1675
01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.078
-You may not be responsible.
but you are accountable.

1676
01:23:00.122 --> 01:23:02.082
God is going
to hold you accountable. Abraham.

1677
01:23:02.165 --> 01:23:04.458
because you know that the prosperity message

1678
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.628
is a promise that's obtained
by spiritual and natural application.

1679
01:23:08.338 --> 01:23:10.298
I'm not asking for your job description.

1680
01:23:10.673 --> 01:23:12.300
I'm asking you to give a damn.

1681
01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:15.095
Some of those people give the very last

1682
01:23:15.137 --> 01:23:16.722
because of the things you say from the pulpit.

1683
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:20.975
Some of them even go into debt.
just to pay their tithes.

1684
01:23:21.018 --> 01:23:22.227
-That's stupid.

1685
01:23:22.227 --> 01:23:23.145
-That's very stupid.

1686
01:23:23.185 --> 01:23:26.605
You don't make it any better
by having them give their tithes

1687
01:23:26.648 --> 01:23:27.858
and offerings on a credit card.

1688
01:23:27.898 --> 01:23:28.733
-What do you want me to do?

1689
01:23:28.775 --> 01:23:33.447
You want me to stop preaching
a principle that is clearly in the Bible

1690
01:23:33.488 --> 01:23:38.243
because a few people are using it
as their winning lottery ticket?

1691
01:23:39.953 --> 01:23:44.207
I am just as responsible and accountable
for the person who has the right motive.

1692
01:23:44.332 --> 01:23:46.000
as I am for the one who doesn't.

1693
01:23:47.002 --> 01:23:49.463
-If you want to teach the prosperity message. that's fine.

1694
01:23:50.588 --> 01:23:53.425
Care enough for the people
that God has placed in your hands.

1695
01:23:54.425 --> 01:23:57.928
to give them some balance.

1696
01:23:58.805 --> 01:24:01.808
It's out of balance. and it's been
that way for years. Abraham.

1697
01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:02.893
-I ain't no con man.

1698
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:03.893
-Prove it.

1699
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.023
Name one member of your church
that has came near broke.

1700
01:24:09.232 --> 01:24:11.943
applied the principles that you told them
will make them rich

1701
01:24:12.068 --> 01:24:13.070
and now they're wealthy.

1702
01:24:13.153 --> 01:24:16.448
Look. I'm not talking about some doctor or lawyer

1703
01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:18.283
or someone with an extensive education.

1704
01:24:18.867 --> 01:24:21.368
I'm talking about the average Joe
that came there broke.

1705
01:24:22.037 --> 01:24:24.330
applied your principles
and now they're rich.

1706
01:24:25.498 --> 01:24:26.665
Come on. Abraham.

1707
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.835
You have 10.000 members.

1708
01:24:29.043 --> 01:24:32.130
I'm sure that somebody
with a pure heart and right motive

1709
01:24:32.588 --> 01:24:35.300
and obtained the wealth that you told them
they would have if they give.

1710
01:24:35.383 --> 01:24:40.138
Prove me wrong. and I'll sign
this bogus deal right now. come on.

1711
01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.933
Oh. you can't can you?

1712
01:24:44.558 --> 01:24:46.603
You see. it's misleading to tell people

1713
01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:48.563
that all they have to do is give
and they'll be rich.

1714
01:24:50.482 --> 01:24:53.943
-"Give and it shall be given
unto you good--

1715
01:24:53.985 --> 01:24:56.195
-"Good measure. pressed down.
shaken together and running over".

1716
01:24:56.238 --> 01:24:59.115
Look. Luke chapter 6
is not about the law of prosperity.

1717
01:24:59.198 --> 01:25:01.283
it's about the law of love.

1718
01:25:03.912 --> 01:25:05.580
Do you see how misleading it could be

1719
01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:09.083
when the prosperity message
comes out of the mouth of a preacher

1720
01:25:09.167 --> 01:25:10.668
who takes God's Word out of context?

1721
01:25:11.335 --> 01:25:12.253
-Dad?

1722
01:25:12.378 --> 01:25:13.420
-Dad.

1723
01:25:13.547 --> 01:25:18.343
-He gave me the mission
for this church. not you.

1724
01:25:19.302 --> 01:25:21.388
I promised him that I would carry it out.

1725
01:25:21.555 --> 01:25:25.350
-Our father is dead.
and that mission should have been buried

1726
01:25:25.392 --> 01:25:28.270
along with him especially
when it doesn't benefit the people.

1727
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:31.148
-That's the thing.
the people are benefiting.

1728
01:25:32.273 --> 01:25:37.487
My members are very. very blessed.

1729
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.530
-Is that what you think?

1730
01:25:40.823 --> 01:25:43.410
I know a few personally
and they're not doing so well.

1731
01:25:47.247 --> 01:25:50.542
You see the people need more than just
some pipe dream about a wealthy place.

1732
01:25:51.835 --> 01:25:54.212
They have real issues
that are hitting them hard.

1733
01:25:54.337 --> 01:25:58.967
Look at what's going on in the world.
mass shootings. a pandemic.

1734
01:25:59.175 --> 01:26:02.303
political corruption. social injustice.
horrible weather.

1735
01:26:02.387 --> 01:26:04.598
Things are hitting them hard
and they are not ready.

1736
01:26:04.723 --> 01:26:05.848
-I get it.

1737
01:26:06.265 --> 01:26:10.020
I get it. but you don't understand.

1738
01:26:11.103 --> 01:26:14.565
I got major financial responsibilities.

1739
01:26:14.733 --> 01:26:18.820
My staff they're not going to understand me
having to lay them off because what?

1740
01:26:18.945 --> 01:26:20.738
The people stopped giving.

1741
01:26:24.033 --> 01:26:25.493
-Where's your faith. Abraham?

1742
01:26:28.205 --> 01:26:30.457
Where's the same faith you require
from your members?

1743
01:26:32.042 --> 01:26:35.670
God can pay small bills.
He can't pay megachurch bills?

1744
01:26:37.047 --> 01:26:37.755
You know what?

1745
01:26:37.838 --> 01:26:41.092
I'm disappointed in you. man.
because at one time you agreed with me.

1746
01:26:41.175 --> 01:26:42.593
-Yes. but then I got a revelation.

1747
01:26:42.677 --> 01:26:43.135
-No. no. no.

1748
01:26:43.178 --> 01:26:46.805
You got a Bentley.
and you forgot about what the ministry was.

1749
01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:52.687
-You know what?

1750
01:26:53.855 --> 01:26:58.443
I'll make no apologies.
not for my success.

1751
01:27:00.028 --> 01:27:02.780
Everything I teach is in that Bible.

1752
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:06.700
I've done very well for myself.

1753
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:10.705
-You're right.

1754
01:27:11.705 --> 01:27:17.170
Your father has made you very rich
and you're just like him.

1755
01:27:17.253 --> 01:27:18.755
[music]

1756
01:27:46.783 --> 01:27:47.492
-Hey.

1757
01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:48.493
-What's going on. Jessica?

1758
01:27:48.535 --> 01:27:49.243
-Hey.

1759
01:27:49.285 --> 01:27:50.035
-Look. I'm sorry I'm late.

1760
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.328
Have you been waiting long?

1761
01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:51.788
-No. no. no.

1762
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:52.288
I just got here.

1763
01:27:54.958 --> 01:27:56.167
-You're looking good.

1764
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:56.960
-Thank you.

1765
01:27:57.043 --> 01:27:58.420
-Things must be going well for you.

1766
01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.878
-They are.

1767
01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.843
I just submitted a proposal
to the Texas Mobile Web project.

1768
01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:05.677
-Really?

1769
01:28:05.718 --> 01:28:06.343
-Yes.

1770
01:28:06.428 --> 01:28:07.637
-Now you know that's a huge company.

1771
01:28:07.678 --> 01:28:08.095
-Yes.

1772
01:28:08.178 --> 01:28:09.347
-I play golf with the CEO.

1773
01:28:10.432 --> 01:28:11.808
-Well. then hook a sister up.

1774
01:28:12.975 --> 01:28:14.393
-There you go with the foolishness.

1775
01:28:14.435 --> 01:28:15.060
-Oh. see there you go.

1776
01:28:15.145 --> 01:28:16.645
Okay. that's fine.

1777
01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:18.523
It's cool. God's got me.

1778
01:28:18.565 --> 01:28:19.148
It's okay.

1779
01:28:19.232 --> 01:28:21.025
-Indeed he does. indeed.

1780
01:28:25.613 --> 01:28:26.613
-Hey. are you okay?

1781
01:28:27.115 --> 01:28:28.867
You don't seem like yourself.

1782
01:28:29.783 --> 01:28:34.788
-It's just been one of those weeks.
unproductive meetings.

1783
01:28:34.955 --> 01:28:38.208
project delays. and a family feud.

1784
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:39.002
-Family?

1785
01:28:39.085 --> 01:28:42.505
I didn't even know you had a family.
you never talk about your personal life.

1786
01:28:42.713 --> 01:28:44.507
-That's because I don't want you in my business.

1787
01:28:47.885 --> 01:28:50.763
My parents are deceased
and I only have one brother.

1788
01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.640
This week was the first time
I spoke with him in years.

1789
01:28:53.725 --> 01:28:56.353
-Let me guess. he wants some money.

1790
01:28:56.435 --> 01:28:57.687
-You better believe it.

1791
01:28:58.313 --> 01:29:00.230
-Family never call
unless they want something.

1792
01:29:00.857 --> 01:29:02.150
What line of work does he do?

1793
01:29:02.983 --> 01:29:04.068
-He's a pastor.

1794
01:29:04.943 --> 01:29:06.613
Bishop Abraham Ayers.

1795
01:29:08.448 --> 01:29:09.615
-You are lying.

1796
01:29:11.242 --> 01:29:16.413
There is no way that my Bishop
is your brother. y'all don't even favor.

1797
01:29:16.998 --> 01:29:19.292
-Well. Abraham takes after my mother.

1798
01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:23.045
I favor my father.
Pastor Michael Ayers Senior.

1799
01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:24.755
That's why they called me Michael Junior.

1800
01:29:24.838 --> 01:29:26.132
-Oh my god.

1801
01:29:26.298 --> 01:29:28.760
Why are you just now telling me about this?

1802
01:29:28.802 --> 01:29:30.220
You know. I'm a member of ALC.

1803
01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.930
Why does Bishop need money?

1804
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:33.973
He's already a millionaire.

1805
01:29:34.057 --> 01:29:35.350
-That's cool with you?

1806
01:29:37.352 --> 01:29:41.147
Preachers continue to get away
with fraud because people like you fail

1807
01:29:41.188 --> 01:29:42.315
to check their credentials.

1808
01:29:42.815 --> 01:29:45.275
Y'all call them men of God
with no real evidence.

1809
01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:48.363
No signs. no wonders. no miracles.

1810
01:29:49.155 --> 01:29:51.908
Y'all even consider some of these clowns doctors

1811
01:29:52.325 --> 01:29:54.118
when they barely even finished high school.

1812
01:29:56.203 --> 01:29:56.870
You know what?

1813
01:29:56.913 --> 01:29:59.623
I'm convinced.
it's not the shepherds that have the problem.

1814
01:29:59.748 --> 01:30:01.793
It's the stupid sheep that follow them.

1815
01:30:01.835 --> 01:30:02.418
-Hold on now.

1816
01:30:02.418 --> 01:30:04.670
See I'm not stupid. you just bitter.

1817
01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:08.675
You're like the prodigal son
that never came home.

1818
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.927
You're the heir apparent.

1819
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:14.763
-Well. my father chose me to lead ALC.
but God chose Abraham.

1820
01:30:14.848 --> 01:30:17.015
-If God chose him.
then why don't you support him?

1821
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.143
-Because he's a coward.

1822
01:30:19.268 --> 01:30:19.978
-Yes. but I don't--

1823
01:30:20.018 --> 01:30:23.815
-Well. look. Jessica.
this is not a subject I like speaking about. all right.

1824
01:30:23.857 --> 01:30:24.440
Let's not.

1825
01:30:24.523 --> 01:30:25.442
[music]

1826
01:30:25.567 --> 01:30:26.317
-Okay.

1827
01:30:26.358 --> 01:30:27.943
I guess I struck a nerve.

1828
01:30:28.862 --> 01:30:30.697
Well. at least I know you're human.

1829
01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.990
You always be so cut and dry.

1830
01:30:33.198 --> 01:30:34.825
Do you even have a girlfriend?

1831
01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:37.703
-I date occasionally.
but it's nothing serious.

1832
01:30:38.745 --> 01:30:39.622
What about you?

1833
01:30:40.038 --> 01:30:43.083
Are you seeing someone
or are you still sleeping with Jason?

1834
01:30:44.418 --> 01:30:46.003
-How do you know about Jason?

1835
01:30:46.128 --> 01:30:47.380
Did he say something?

1836
01:30:47.463 --> 01:30:48.380
-Oh. he didn't have to.

1837
01:30:50.133 --> 01:30:51.718
Seriously have you ever been in love?

1838
01:30:53.343 --> 01:30:54.012
-Yes.

1839
01:30:54.137 --> 01:30:59.142
There was this dude that I met in college.
I just knew that he was the one.

1840
01:30:59.183 --> 01:30:59.893
-Really?

1841
01:30:59.893 --> 01:31:00.477
-Yes.

1842
01:31:00.518 --> 01:31:01.143
-Okay.

1843
01:31:01.185 --> 01:31:02.020
What happened?

1844
01:31:02.187 --> 01:31:04.898
-Well. I brought him home
to meet my family.

1845
01:31:04.938 --> 01:31:05.815
He fell in love with my sister.

1846
01:31:05.857 --> 01:31:07.400
They're married now with two kids. still.

1847
01:31:07.442 --> 01:31:08.693
Yes.

1848
01:31:08.693 --> 01:31:09.152
-Ooh.

1849
01:31:09.152 --> 01:31:10.403
That's one of them-- You know what?

1850
01:31:10.445 --> 01:31:11.695
Let me go ahead and pour you a--

1851
01:31:11.738 --> 01:31:12.322
-Pour it down.

1852
01:31:12.363 --> 01:31:12.988
-You know what I'm saying?

1853
01:31:12.988 --> 01:31:14.240
You might need a little bit more than I do.

1854
01:31:14.282 --> 01:31:15.658
-It's cool now.

1855
01:31:15.658 --> 01:31:16.158
It's cool.

1856
01:31:16.325 --> 01:31:18.703
-Seriously. have you ever forgiven your sister?

1857
01:31:19.537 --> 01:31:20.747
-Have you forgiven your brother?

1858
01:31:23.415 --> 01:31:24.292
-You know what. Jessica?

1859
01:31:24.292 --> 01:31:25.460
I'm not about to do this dance with you.

1860
01:31:25.543 --> 01:31:28.713
-Speaking of dance. let's.

1861
01:31:30.923 --> 01:31:31.465
Yes.

1862
01:31:31.548 --> 01:31:31.925
-What--

1863
01:31:31.965 --> 01:31:32.633
-I want to cut a rug.

1864
01:31:32.675 --> 01:31:33.675
-What do you know about the dancefloor?

1865
01:31:33.718 --> 01:31:34.093
-I know a little bit.

1866
01:31:34.218 --> 01:31:34.760
I know a lot of it.

1867
01:31:34.802 --> 01:31:35.135
-Okay.

1868
01:31:35.887 --> 01:31:36.553
Make it happen.

1869
01:31:36.595 --> 01:31:38.097
[music]
Gone too long.

1870
01:31:38.932 --> 01:31:41.308
When you coming back?

1871
01:31:42.518 --> 01:31:44.728
Back to the world.

1872
01:31:45.688 --> 01:31:47.523
When you coming back?

1873
01:31:48.525 --> 01:31:50.735
Back to the world.

1874
01:31:51.027 --> 01:31:51.818
Ye.

1875
01:31:51.903 --> 01:31:53.947
[music]

1876
01:33:19.198 --> 01:33:20.283
[laughter]

1877
01:33:20.365 --> 01:33:21.117
-You're so [?].

1878
01:33:21.325 --> 01:33:22.118
-Oh. man.

1879
01:33:25.747 --> 01:33:26.913
-Do you want to come in?

1880
01:33:26.955 --> 01:33:29.208
-Do you have lights
in this spot because [crosstalk]-

1881
01:33:29.208 --> 01:33:29.667
-I have lights.

1882
01:33:29.708 --> 01:33:30.418
You see my lights.

1883
01:33:30.418 --> 01:33:31.710
-You know you got to be paying your bills and stuff.

1884
01:33:31.793 --> 01:33:35.380
[laughs] No. I think I'm going
to have to decline your invitation tonight.

1885
01:33:35.505 --> 01:33:36.673
-Why?

1886
01:33:36.798 --> 01:33:37.592
I don't bite.

1887
01:33:37.717 --> 01:33:41.720
-Well. I'm just trying
to do things a little differently now.

1888
01:33:41.888 --> 01:33:44.098
I've been celibate for about two years.

1889
01:33:44.182 --> 01:33:47.018
and I really don't want to come inside
and be tempted.

1890
01:33:48.478 --> 01:33:49.645
-I respect that.

1891
01:33:50.313 --> 01:33:52.398
Plus. I've been celibate for--

1892
01:33:52.482 --> 01:33:54.317
-A lot less than two years.

1893
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:54.858
-Yes.

1894
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.610
[laughs]

1895
01:33:55.693 --> 01:33:57.487
-Seriously though Jessica.

1896
01:33:57.528 --> 01:33:58.278
I really like you.

1897
01:33:58.278 --> 01:34:02.075
If we want to do this thing.
then we need to do it the right way. all right?

1898
01:34:03.117 --> 01:34:03.700
-Okay.

1899
01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:06.328
You're quite amazing. Michael Juniors.

1900
01:34:07.413 --> 01:34:09.623
-So are you. Ms. Jessica Clark.

1901
01:34:11.918 --> 01:34:12.543
Goodnight.

1902
01:34:14.628 --> 01:34:15.420
-Goodnight.

1903
01:34:16.047 --> 01:34:17.590
-See you later.

1904
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:18.132
-Okay.

1905
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.052
-Pastor Thompson.

1906
01:34:21.093 --> 01:34:21.468
-Yes [?].

1907
01:34:21.468 --> 01:34:22.887
-Do you have that list I asked you for?

1908
01:34:22.928 --> 01:34:23.553
-Yes. sir.

1909
01:34:24.388 --> 01:34:25.555
That's the tithing report.

1910
01:34:25.723 --> 01:34:26.890
-Good.

1911
01:34:26.933 --> 01:34:27.725
Good.

1912
01:34:27.767 --> 01:34:28.183
Good.

1913
01:34:28.225 --> 01:34:29.685
Good. I plan on making some home visits.

1914
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.688
-When are you doing that?

1915
01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:32.980
Because you're not doing it by yourself.

1916
01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:37.193
-I appreciate your concern.
but I'll be fine.

1917
01:34:37.318 --> 01:34:39.528
I'm going to ride this one solo. all right.

1918
01:34:39.653 --> 01:34:40.863
I'll be fine.

1919
01:34:40.947 --> 01:34:41.738
I will.

1920
01:34:42.365 --> 01:34:43.448
Don't sweat it.

1921
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:44.200
Y'all lock up.

1922
01:34:44.242 --> 01:34:46.618
[music]

1923
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.457
-You're telling me that all of your members
are going to live lavishly like you do?

1924
01:34:58.548 --> 01:35:01.383
-Prosperity is like salvation. okay.

1925
01:35:01.425 --> 01:35:04.720
It's available for all.
but not all are going to receive it.

1926
01:35:04.803 --> 01:35:06.805
[music]

1927
01:35:24.698 --> 01:35:27.075
-Well. stop telling them
that they're all going to be rich.

1928
01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:30.580
Stop having them sow seeds
for millions. mansions.

1929
01:35:30.663 --> 01:35:32.790
and Mercedes when you know half of them
won't even see them.

1930
01:35:32.873 --> 01:35:34.000
Stop man.

1931
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:34.625
Just stop.

1932
01:35:36.753 --> 01:35:40.338
Stop having them give money to you believing
that they're going to live life at your level.

1933
01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:48.055
-My members are very. very blessed.

1934
01:35:48.723 --> 01:35:49.515
-Really?

1935
01:35:51.768 --> 01:35:52.727
Is that what you think?

1936
01:35:53.268 --> 01:35:56.397
Because I know a few personally
and they're not doing so well.

1937
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.608
[music]

1938
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:48.448
-God. am I pleasing you?

1939
01:36:51.035 --> 01:36:56.207
I am doing everything I know.

1940
01:36:57.415 --> 01:37:00.503
All that I know to do
and it doesn't--

1941
01:37:00.628 --> 01:37:02.963
[phone rings]

1942
01:37:13.307 --> 01:37:14.140
-Hello.

1943
01:37:14.808 --> 01:37:17.143
-Bishop. I'm glad I caught you.

1944
01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:19.480
I have some exciting news for you.

1945
01:37:20.523 --> 01:37:26.863
-Doc. I could really use some good news right now.

1946
01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:32.118
-I'm about to give you the biggest platform
you've ever had in your ministerial career.

1947
01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.955
I met with the board
for the International Prosperity Conference.

1948
01:37:37.038 --> 01:37:41.710
which consists of the most prolific faith
and prosperity teachers in the world.

1949
01:37:42.712 --> 01:37:46.715
We decided you would
close out the conference next month.

1950
01:37:46.757 --> 01:37:48.758
-Wait a minute.

1951
01:37:48.758 --> 01:37:51.387
Wait-- me?

1952
01:37:52.722 --> 01:37:58.352
Doc. I don't understand how--
why would y'all choose me?

1953
01:37:58.978 --> 01:37:59.562
-Why?

1954
01:38:00.187 --> 01:38:03.232
Bishop.
there is no one in ministry

1955
01:38:03.315 --> 01:38:06.943
that can get the people
to empty their wallets like you.

1956
01:38:07.737 --> 01:38:12.950
You've been chosen to put yourself
and us in a position for our abundance.

1957
01:38:13.618 --> 01:38:17.622
You've got to do that
"Seven. seven. seven. complete" thing again.

1958
01:38:17.747 --> 01:38:19.248
Man. that was genius.

1959
01:38:19.707 --> 01:38:25.045
Your father was good.
but man you are much better. much better than he was.

1960
01:38:25.922 --> 01:38:27.505
He'd be very proud of you son.

1961
01:38:29.675 --> 01:38:30.675
What do you say?

1962
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:35.388
-No.

1963
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:36.473
No.

1964
01:38:38.308 --> 01:38:39.560
No.

1965
01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:42.395
No.

1966
01:38:42.438 --> 01:38:45.315
[music]

1967
01:39:12.718 --> 01:39:13.760
-[singing] I believe.

1968
01:39:16.138 --> 01:39:21.268
Every day I believe.

1969
01:39:32.863 --> 01:39:33.823
I did it.

1970
01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:39.620
I did it.

1971
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:50.297
I stood in front of the congregation
and I said it in the same manipulative way that you did.

1972
01:39:54.468 --> 01:39:58.222
Even after you died.
I continued to do it

1973
01:39:59.348 --> 01:40:05.228
just because I wanted you to love me
and I wanted you to be proud.

1974
01:40:09.608 --> 01:40:16.907
I love you. daddy.
but I can no longer carry your mantle.

1975
01:40:22.038 --> 01:40:25.332
[sniffles]

1976
01:40:27.293 --> 01:40:30.628
I denounce everything
that you have taught me about ministry.

1977
01:40:40.347 --> 01:40:41.265
I'm sorry.

1978
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:43.768
[music]

1979
01:40:53.903 --> 01:41:03.453
Oh. amazing grace.
amazing grace

1980
01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:12.713
God's grace
is truly amazing

1981
01:41:12.797 --> 01:41:20.428
Amazing grace.
amazing grace

1982
01:41:21.138 --> 01:41:29.855
God's grace
is truly amazing

1983
01:41:32.233 --> 01:41:34.360
[applause]

1984
01:41:35.402 --> 01:41:36.362
-Good morning.

1985
01:41:36.445 --> 01:41:37.278
[sniffles]

1986
01:41:37.363 --> 01:41:38.280
-Good morning.

1987
01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:44.453
-I know many of you may be wondering
why I look such a mess.

1988
01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:53.963
The truth is.
I've been a mess long before today.

1989
01:41:58.675 --> 01:42:05.683
As I looked at the state of this church
and where you are naturally and spiritually.

1990
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:20.447
I was disgusted [sniffles] mainly with myself.

1991
01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:34.170
I'm not going to shift the blame
or adopt the saying that the church

1992
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:37.630
is some hospital for sick people.

1993
01:42:39.383 --> 01:42:48.017
That's not what the Bible says
and that was never his intent for this church.

1994
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:52.563
specifically this church.

1995
01:42:56.233 --> 01:43:04.783
I know what God said
and I've repented because I was disobedient.

1996
01:43:07.285 --> 01:43:25.137
Now. I repent to you the people
because I have failed you as your pastor and I am sorry.

1997
01:43:31.852 --> 01:43:40.693
I'm sorry for teaching you
to seek God's hand instead of seeking His face.

1998
01:43:43.572 --> 01:43:52.580
I'm sorry for requiring you to give God your money
before you even give him your heart.

1999
01:44:03.342 --> 01:44:09.723
I spent the last 48 hours seeking God
on where to go next.

2000
01:44:10.557 --> 01:44:18.565
how Abraham moves forward with this ministry.
and He told me to let it go.

2001
01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:31.995
I'm letting go of the mission
my father asked me to carry out.

2002
01:44:33.247 --> 01:44:38.377
I'm letting go of these mentors
that taught me to steal from you.

2003
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:52.098
I'm letting go of the--
I'm letting go of the message.

2004
01:44:56.145 --> 01:44:58.897
That misled you
and gave you false hope.

2005
01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:07.488
I'm letting go of the old way
and I'm willing to let God have his way.

2006
01:45:10.993 --> 01:45:17.583
I know. today. I am not the only person
that has something to let go.

2007
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:26.425
If you are here today
and you are ready to truly and totally commit to God.

2008
01:45:26.467 --> 01:45:27.760
I want you to stand on your feet.

2009
01:45:29.135 --> 01:45:36.225
I want you to stand on your feet and God wants
an offering from you today and it's not money.

2010
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:37.018
It's not money.

2011
01:45:37.102 --> 01:45:38.187
It's not money.

2012
01:45:38.853 --> 01:45:42.232
As a matter of fact.
if you have your tithes and your offerings.

2013
01:45:42.358 --> 01:45:47.278
take them out and give them
to somebody that has a need or financial desire

2014
01:45:49.113 --> 01:45:54.745
because. today. the only offering
that God wants from you is your heart.

2015
01:45:58.207 --> 01:46:03.503
Today.
we let go of our sins and our selfish ambitions

2016
01:46:03.545 --> 01:46:06.965
and we take up our cross
and we are going to follow Jesus.

2017
01:46:09.927 --> 01:46:11.053
I love y'all.

2018
01:46:11.135 --> 01:46:11.928
Let me pray for you.

2019
01:46:12.553 --> 01:46:17.017
Father. we thank you
for these people. these souls.

2020
01:46:17.058 --> 01:46:20.103
that you have allowed me
to be the shepherd over.

2021
01:46:22.855 --> 01:46:29.655
I love you. and from this day forward.
I commit to serving them.

2022
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:36.912
I commit to always listen
to your voice.

2023
01:46:39.832 --> 01:46:42.875
In Jesus' name. Amen.

2024
01:46:42.918 --> 01:46:44.710

2026
01:47:10.903 --> 01:47:15.908
-Amen. amen.

2031
01:47:57.575 --> 01:47:58.785
-Okay. I'm good.

2032
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:04.540
Is it too late to join the church. man?

2033
01:48:04.665 --> 01:48:06.335
[chuckles]

2034
01:48:06.418 --> 01:48:08.212
[music]

2035
01:48:31.777 --> 01:48:34.780
-Mr. Andrew.
I want to let you know that you do have the job.

2036
01:48:35.613 --> 01:48:37.658
-Thank you.

2037
01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.325
-You're welcome. son.

2038

[music]

2039
01:48:41.078 --> 01:48:45.457
Clap your hands in the air.
stump your feet on the floor.

2040
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:50.628
Clap your hands in the air.
stump your feet on the floor.

2041
01:48:50.795 --> 01:48:55.842
Clap your hands in the air.
stump your feet on the floor.

2043
01:49:04.058 --> 01:49:04.475
-Two.

2044
01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:04.935
-One.

2045
01:49:05.018 --> 01:49:05.978
Good job.

2046
01:49:06.143 --> 01:49:07.062
-Have I won

2047
01:49:07.145 --> 01:49:08.688
-Oh yes.

2048
01:49:08.772 --> 01:49:09.313
[laughter]

2049
01:49:10.565 --> 01:49:11.942
-All right.

2050
01:49:12.067 --> 01:49:12.900
-Yes.

2051
01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:15.570
-My brother and I are starting
a school of business.

2052
01:49:15.737 --> 01:49:22.285
We plan to teach people how to establish
and maintain successful businesses.

2053
01:49:23.662 --> 01:49:27.040
We're going to build this community.
but we're going to build it

2054
01:49:27.082 --> 01:49:31.295
by building up the people spiritually
and financially.

2055
01:49:32.503 --> 01:49:37.425
We're no longer living to just receive
a blessing. but to be one.

2056
01:49:40.053 --> 01:49:45.975
I've learned it is way better to give than it is to receive.

2057
01:49:47.143 --> 01:49:50.772
The Bible actually says
that whatever you purpose in your heart.

2058
01:49:50.897 --> 01:49:59.655
that's what you ought to give
and that's what ALC will live by from this point forward.

2059
01:50:00.198 --> 01:50:00.948
-Amen?

2083
01:51:03.135 --> 01:51:03.720
Our.

2084
01:51:03.845 --> 01:51:04.970
-[gasps] Oh my God.

2085
01:51:05.805 --> 01:51:07.015
Oh my God. Michael.

2086
01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.642
-Yes.
You didn't even see that coming. huh?

2087
01:51:08.725 --> 01:51:09.308
-[squeals] I didn't.

2088
01:51:09.308 --> 01:51:10.018
It was slick.

2089
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:10.685
[chuckles]

2090
01:51:10.768 --> 01:51:11.185

[music]

2097
01:51:45.053 --> 01:51:46.680
-It's not as beautiful as you. though.

2098
01:51:46.805 --> 01:51:47.347
-Yes.

2099
01:51:47.513 --> 01:51:48.807

2101
01:51:49.683 --> 01:51:50.058
-Yes?

2102
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:50.975
Do you want to take it off?

2103
01:51:51.017 --> 01:51:51.600
I'm joking.

2104
01:51:51.643 --> 01:51:52.810
[chuckles]
-I definitely do.

2105
01:51:52.935 --> 01:51:55.020
[chuckles] That's what--

2106
01:51:55.063 --> 01:51:55.897
-Now. hold on. y'all.

2107
01:51:55.938 --> 01:51:56.480
Hey.
-Hey.

2108
01:51:57.898 --> 01:51:59.108
Where are you going?

2109
01:51:59.275 --> 01:52:04.030
The reception is that way and I got
to get my dance with this beautiful bride.

2110
01:52:04.155 --> 01:52:04.655
-Aww.

2111
01:52:04.698 --> 01:52:05.990
Bishop.
-Not before I get my dance.

2112
01:52:06.032 --> 01:52:07.075
-Stop.

2113
01:52:07.117 --> 01:52:08.577
We in the room with the bishop.

2114
01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:09.493
-Stop.

2115
01:52:09.578 --> 01:52:10.203
Look.

2116
01:52:10.287 --> 01:52:11.872
Y'all haven't even cut the cake yet.

2117
01:52:11.955 --> 01:52:12.748
-Shit.

2118
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:14.373
I'm about to cut the cake right now.

2119
01:52:14.458 --> 01:52:14.958
-Oh God.

2120
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.333
Bye. Bishop.

2121
01:52:16.375 --> 01:52:17.793
-Guess I'll see you later. brother.

2122
01:52:17.835 --> 01:52:18.210
-Bye.

2123
01:52:18.878 --> 01:52:19.670
-Yep.

2124
01:52:19.713 --> 01:52:20.380
Yep.

2125
01:52:20.422 --> 01:52:22.965
Y'all can't be serious.

2126
01:52:23.048 --> 01:52:24.383
[music]

2127
01:52:30.432 --> 01:52:32.142
-I have a spiritual question for you.

2128
01:52:32.225 --> 01:52:39.733
Is cosigning a sin.
because I had some implications. demonic implications.

2129
01:52:39.858 --> 01:52:43.820
that said I wasn't able
to get what I wanted out of life?

2130
01:52:43.862 --> 01:52:48.365
I just figured another signature
of the Lord's that could be used

2131
01:52:48.365 --> 01:52:52.412
and provided to take me
to high aspirations in life.

2132
01:52:52.537 --> 01:52:55.165
because life is all about cosigning.

2133
01:52:55.248 --> 01:52:56.750
You have to have a signature.

2134
01:52:56.792 --> 01:52:59.920
