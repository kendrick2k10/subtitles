00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:39.662
<i>Can we talk about
my favorite werewolf?</i>

6
00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.749
<i>Clawdeen Wolf.</i>

7
00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:44.966

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:48.184
<i>She always stands up
for her friends.</i>

9
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.227
<i>Clawdeen came to Monster High
with a big secret.</i>

10
00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:54.923
<i>She was hiding the truth that
she was half wolf. half human.</i>

11
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.358
<i>To go to a monster school
that hated humans--</i>

12
00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.836
<i>but when Monster High
faced its biggest threat...</i>

13
00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:03.227
Smile.

14
00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:04.488
What have you done?

15
00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.184
Think of it as extra credit.

16
00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:12.401
<i>From now on.

You changed the world.

<i>By owning her humanness.

20
00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.445
<i>she transformed Monster High</i>

21
00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:27.749
<i>into what it is today.
a place that accepts</i>

22
00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:30.227
<i>all monsters of all kinds.</i>

23
00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.140
Oh. my Ra.

24
00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.445
I seriously can't believe
some random ghoul

25
00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:38.532
in Scary Indiana made this.

26
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.575
A million likes?

27
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:40.966
Clawdeen's famous.

28
00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:44.445
999.000. OK?
Let's not get crazy.

29
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:47.836
Hey.

30
00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:49.792
Who are all these new kids?

31
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:51.532
Freshmen. like us last year.

32
00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.358
only not as fabulous.

33
00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:55.401
Smile.

34
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:58.619
Hey.

35
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:00.488
Oh.
Here you go.

36
00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.010
Enjoy.
- Hey. Draculaura.

37
00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:03.445
Great party.

38
00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:05.314
Got to say goodbye to
summer in style. ghouls.

39
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.836
- Yeah!
- Thanks.

40
00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:08.749
- Hi.
- Lagoona.

41
00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:10.445
Where have you been?

42
00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:12.097
I was playing sea pong with
the serpents in your moat.

43
00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:18.792
I might have eaten one or two.

44
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.097
Before rants
and lectures bore.

45
00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:22.705
protect my father's
hardwood floor.

46
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.705
- Thanks. D.
- Of course.

47
00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.618
Enjoy.
- Uh-huh.

48
00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:29.661
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

49
00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:33.097
I'm en fuego.

50
00:02:33.184 --> 00:02:35.314
Well. not literally.
I'm pacing myself.

51
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.923
Will there be dancing later?

52
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.661
There usually is. right. D?

53
00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.661
It's always a crowd pleaser.

54
00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.792
Speaking of crowd pleasers.

55
00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.314
any sign of the world's
newest Eek Tok star?

56
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:47.140
Not yet.

57
00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.879
But she better get here soon if
she knows what's good for her.

58
00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:50.358
- Ow.

59
00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:51.532
Moe. again?

60
00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:53.140
Bad hair day?

61
00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:54.401
Yeah. they've just
been on edge lately.

62
00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:55.923
Because they're bored.

63
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.705
You never let them out. bro.

64
00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:00.097
Let your light shine.

65
00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:01.532
Heath. no flames!

66
00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:03.488
I said no flames!

67
00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:04.836
Yes. sir.

68
00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:06.314
Dad. you're embarrassing me.

69
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.184
Your birthday will
be nothing like this.

70
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:11.574
Only the most important
monsters will be there.

71
00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:14.314
Dad. I told you.
I just want something small

72
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:15.488
with my friends.

73
00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:16.966
I heard you.

74
00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.184
And one day.
when you're older.

75
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:20.010
you can pay
for your own parties

76
00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.053
and then you can throw them
any way you like.

77
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.836
Right.

78
00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:26.271
Oh.
I have to take this.

79
00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:28.271
It's my brother.

80
00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:31.053
I finally got a mobile.

81
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.271
Hello. Dadu.
How are you?

82
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:36.532
They're here.

83
00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.618
You're late.

84
00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:42.531
Nice to see you too.

85
00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.140
I just had to pick up a friend.

86
00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:46.010
Hi. It's me.
I'm the friend.

87
00:03:46.097 --> 00:03:48.531
- The Boos are back.

88
00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:55.574
This is going to be--

89
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.879
all: The best year ever!

90
00:03:57.966 --> 00:03:59.445
Come on.
Come on.

91
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:03.879
This is amazing.

92
00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.488
- Why. thank you.
- Clawdeen.

93
00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:06.661
Look.
It's really her.

94
00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.401
Hi. Clawdeen.

95
00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:10.574
Uh. do I know them?

96
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.401
No. you silly wolf.

97
00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:13.966
It's that Eek Tok video.

98
00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.184
Everyone's seen it.

99
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.314
Oh.

100
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:18.618
Wow.

101
00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:21.053
Hey.

102
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.661
- Hi.
- The alpha wolf arrives.

103
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:26.314
How's it feel to be famous?

104
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:28.140
Yeah. I--

105
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.445
I think I might have
liked it better when

106
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.749
I was just one of the pack.

107
00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.271
Well. you better
get used to it.

108
00:04:32.358 --> 00:04:34.184
You're the big monster
on campus this year.

109
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:35.227
Come on.

110
00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:36.705

want to meet you.

111
00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:38.749
- Right.

112
00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:40.140

183
00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:47.749
♪ Boom. boom. boom ♪

184
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.184
Yo. I just found
Clawdeen's Eek Tok

185
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:57.618
dubbed in Turkish
by a kid in Istanghoul.

186
00:07:57.705 --> 00:07:59.705
- What?
- No way.

187
00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:01.097
Look at that.

188
00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:02.836
Wow.
Our little wolf's gone viral.

189
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.184
Look at the likes.

190
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.140
Oh. my ghoul.
Oh. and the comments.

191
00:08:12.184 --> 00:08:14.140
It's time.

192
00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:25.097
Hello. all my new
ghouls and banshees.

193
00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:26.879
kookafurras--oh!

194
00:08:26.966 --> 00:08:29.357
And poltergeists.

195
00:08:29.444 --> 00:08:31.661
Monster High welcomes you.

196
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:33.140
So my hair guy was like. hairspray?

197
00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:34.705
And I'm like. no. never use it.

198
00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:36.531
And he goes. it'll look great.

199
00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:38.618
And I was like. OK.

200
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.270
Bad idea.

201
00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:41.357
Whoosh.

202
00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:42.836
Even the scissors melted.

203
00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:44.749
Now I'm. like. totally
banned from the salon.

204
00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:46.487
I've been banned from salon
since birth.

205
00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:47.749
My hair doesn't grow
on account of it

206
00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:49.487
being from a dead person.

207
00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:51.923
And I have Undead
Civilizations after lunch.

208
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.270
- So do I.
- Oh.

209
00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:55.226
I'll save you a seat.
- Gracias. thanks.

210
00:08:55.313 --> 00:08:57.444
Oh.

211
00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:59.487
What is it?

212
00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:02.140
Calm down.

213
00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:04.574
What?

214
00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:06.966
Tora's back?

215
00:09:09.574 --> 00:09:11.444
Oh. my Ra.

216
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:12.923
She's back.

217
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.097
- What?
- Who's back?

218
00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.140
You know. her.

219
00:09:24.923 --> 00:09:28.313
Monster High. I missed you.

220
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.879
Wow.
That's. like. a you move.

221
00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.531
Who is she?

222
00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:34.313
Toralei Stripe.

223
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.749
She studied abroad last year
in Scaris. France.

224
00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:38.487
Growls. ghouls.

225
00:09:38.574 --> 00:09:40.010
- What's up. Toralei?
- Hey. Tor.

226
00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:41.053
It's been a minute.

227
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.661
Hello. Toralei.

228
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.618
Cleo. you look ferocious.

229
00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:46.226
And how was your year abroad?

230
00:09:46.313 --> 00:09:48.618
Did you catch any
cute Scaresian mice?

231
00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:50.923
Oh. I caught creatures
much bigger than mice.

232
00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:55.140
- Oh.
- She said she ate them all.

233
00:09:55.226 --> 00:09:57.313
Fierce.

234
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.444
Hi.
I'm Frankie.

235
00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:01.923
And can I just say.
you are totally clawesome

236
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.966
and intimidating.
yet still approachable way.

237
00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.705
Frankie. do you always

238
00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:07.923
just speak every thought
that comes to mind?

239
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.705
- Yes.
- I like it.

240
00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.313
Thanks.

241
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.139
And you must be
the famous human.

242
00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:17.139
Human and wolf.
Name's Clawdeen.

243
00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:19.923
Love. did you know that cats

244
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.531
have a far more nuanced
sense of smell than dogs?

245
00:10:22.618 --> 00:10:23.879
Meowchachino. please.

246
00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:27.879
And what I smell above all else

247
00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:30.444
is a human at Monster High.

248
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.010
You better get
used to it. Tor.

249
00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.357
It's how things are now.

250
00:10:33.444 --> 00:10:36.357
And Draculaura.
the witch with fangs.

251
00:10:36.444 --> 00:10:38.010
You're funny.

252
00:10:38.097 --> 00:10:39.487
I have no sense of humor. love.

253
00:10:42.097 --> 00:10:43.313
Oh.

254
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.836
- Monster High's changed. Tor.
- And for the better.

255
00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:53.139
Yes.
It's strange coming back.

256
00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:54.792
It's like everyone's
forgotten how dangerous

257
00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:56.226
the world really is.

258
00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:58.531
Different doesn't
always mean dangerous.

259
00:10:58.618 --> 00:10:59.923
Really?

260
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.357
I was attacked by witches
in France.

261
00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:05.705
They had daggers made
of wraith silver.

262
00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:09.749
Oh.

263
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:13.618
Draculaura never mentioned
wraith silver to you.

264
00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:16.183
It's a witchcraft-forged
metal--

265
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.749
lethal to monsters.

266
00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:24.531
You have no idea
how painful this was.

267
00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:26.226
I protected my pack
that night.

268
00:11:26.313 --> 00:11:27.836
and I intend
to do the same here.

269
00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:29.923
We also protect our pack.

270
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.792
We just think more monsters
deserve to be in it.

271
00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.444
You could come
hang out with us.

272
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.879
This Friday is game night.

273
00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:38.749
We have a lot of board games.

274
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.574
- Cheers.

275
00:11:45.444 --> 00:11:47.010
Classic Toralei.

276
00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:48.531
Yeah.

277
00:11:48.618 --> 00:11:50.923
I guess she doesn't
like board games.

278
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.487
Classic.

279
00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:55.661
Free mops.
Get your mops.

280
00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:57.661
Oh.
Hey. Growlwool.

281
00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.183
Hi. Fantasma.

282
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.531
Hope you got that
roommate you wanted.

283
00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:02.096
Seriously. you're amazing.

284
00:12:02.183 --> 00:12:03.879
You remember everyone.

285
00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:05.618
Got to make
everyone feel welcome.

286
00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:07.313
Who did that for us?

287
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.749
I think we did.

288
00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:10.400
Oh. right.

289
00:12:10.487 --> 00:12:12.313
I remember I was
so overwhelmed.

290
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.792
I thought the Coffin Bean
was an actual legume.

291
00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:19.531
Oh!

292
00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:21.139
Sorry.

293
00:12:23.183 --> 00:12:24.531
My new electrical system.

294
00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:27.531
Sometimes it's a
little too responsive.

295
00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:29.270
The other night.
I accidentally shocked my mom

296
00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:31.444
and gave her a perm.

297
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:32.574
She looks good.

298
00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:34.661
Clawdeen.

299
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.313
Wow.
Clawdeen Wolf.

300
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.487
It's really you.

301
00:12:39.574 --> 00:12:41.400
I'm Demi. Demi Bouvier.

302
00:12:41.487 --> 00:12:44.661
Did you get my DM on Eek Tok.
or Spook Book. or Grum Gram?

303
00:12:44.749 --> 00:12:46.009
You're the reason I'm here.

304
00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:48.009
I'm ghost and human.

305
00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:51.096
And you inspired me
to own all of me.

306
00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:55.836
Uh...

307
00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:59.183
I'm solid most of the time
until I get excited.

308
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.226
I used to think I couldn't
tell anyone. but not anymore.

309
00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:06.139
I know the feeling.

310
00:13:06.226 --> 00:13:08.183
I made these.

311
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.444
They're human-monster
pride buttons.

312
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.705
We formed a Pride Club.

313
00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.400
Would you sign one?

314
00:13:13.487 --> 00:13:16.009
Sure.

315
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:18.357
Here.

316
00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:20.400
Oh. wow.

317
00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:21.923
I made that too.

318
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.705
Ghoul has skills.

319
00:13:30.965 --> 00:13:32.183
- Oh.
- Oh. Sorry.

320
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.183
Oh. I'm so sorry.

321
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.052
No. my bad.

322
00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:36.923
Hey. you've got Monster Lit
with Ogre Oberlin.

323
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:38.270
I hate to break it to you.

324
00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:40.574
but her homework
is legendarily brutal.

325
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:43.749
Well. uh. nice to meet
a fellow victim.

326
00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:45.618
I'm Ellis. by the way.

327
00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:47.226
Draculaura.

328
00:13:47.313 --> 00:13:49.270
And I'm Frankie.
Pronouns. they/them.

329
00:13:49.357 --> 00:13:51.183
I'm made from a collection
of dead people's body parts.

330
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.705
I'm just one years old
this week.

331
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:53.965
Uh. nice to meet you.

332
00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:55.879
Ellis.
He/him.

333
00:13:55.965 --> 00:13:57.705
Hey. I'm kind of starving.

334
00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:59.183
Where can a vamp get
a bite around here?

335
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.313
Creepeteria.
Take the path to the main hall.

336
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.879
But watch out for the pizza.
Make sure they hold the garlic.

337
00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:05.792
Oh. and the anchovies. please.

338
00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.749
Right?
both: Because they're gross.

339
00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:10.965
Jinx.

340
00:14:11.052 --> 00:14:13.009
I'll see you around. Draculaura.

341
00:14:13.096 --> 00:14:16.009
Frankie.
- Yeah.

342
00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:18.052
He's a vampire too.

343
00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.487
Yeah.
I noticed. Frankie.

344
00:14:21.574 --> 00:14:23.139
- Attention.

345
00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:25.922
<i>All students are to report
to the Clawditorium</i>

346
00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:28.096
<i>for a special assembly</i>

347
00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:30.226
<i>immediately after dinner tonight.</i>

348
00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:33.618
<i>On a related note. dinner
will include piranha soup.</i>

349
00:14:33.705 --> 00:14:36.487
<i>Please eat it
before it eats you.</i>

350
00:14:36.574 --> 00:14:38.618
<i>We mean it.
Thank you.</i>

351
00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:41.400
Mm.
This is delicious.

352
00:14:41.487 --> 00:14:43.052
I don't know.
I think you're just hungry.

353
00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:44.749
Starving.

354
00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.009
OK. there's no time
anymore to eat. to think.

355
00:14:47.096 --> 00:14:49.226
There's always somebody
who needs something.

356
00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:51.836
Popularity--
fun. but exhausting.

357
00:14:51.922 --> 00:14:54.400
Right?

358
00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:56.749
OK. come on.
Hand them over.

359
00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.009
Oh. come on.

360
00:15:00.096 --> 00:15:01.400
I don't want
to turn to stone.

361
00:15:01.487 --> 00:15:02.792
Sorry.
- Fine. Fine.

362
00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:04.878
Mm-hmm.

363
00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:06.226
Oh.
Thank you.

364
00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:08.139
- You good?

365
00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:09.400
Good.

366
00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:14.139
You look tired.

367
00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.096
Yeah. I've been arguing
with my mom a lot lately.

368
00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:18.444
Gorga whatever thing again?

369
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:19.922
Gorgodium.
Yeah.

370
00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:21.357
Hey. she can't
just expect you

371
00:15:21.444 --> 00:15:22.357
to up and leave school
for a whole year.

372
00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:23.965
It's not fair.

373
00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:26.226
It's what gorgons do
to come of age.

374
00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:28.965
a ritual year to run wild
and find yourself.

375
00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:31.618
some meditation.
some self-reflection.

376
00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:32.835
with a lot of running around

377
00:15:32.922 --> 00:15:34.357
and terrorizing
the countryside.

378
00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:36.487
See. that doesn't
sound like you.

379
00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:39.139
Yeah. and I keep trying
to tell my mom that.

380
00:15:39.226 --> 00:15:42.052
but she just--
she hates Monster High.

381
00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:44.052
She calls it my little cage.

382
00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:46.226
Well. I. for one.

383
00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:48.009
am glad you've decided
to stay in your cage.

384
00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:49.183
Yeah?

385
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.009
Yeah.

386
00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:54.574
But how about a break
for everyone?

387
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.183
Wow.

388
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.749
Thanks.

389
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.878
Uh. I mean--
um. this is not a good idea.

390
00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:09.487
- I--
- Glasses. please.

391
00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:12.574
Yeah.
Sorry.

392
00:16:12.661 --> 00:16:15.270
All right.
Take your seats. please.

393
00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:17.444
The assembly is about to begin.

394
00:16:17.531 --> 00:16:20.661
And vampires. do not hang
from the rafters.

395
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:22.357
You're drooling on
the students below you.

396
00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:24.096
- Hey.
- Take a seat.

397
00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.444
- Oh. how's student council?
- My head hurts.

398
00:16:26.531 --> 00:16:29.400
Hey. Clawdeuce. Focus.

399
00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:32.574
When did that catch on?

400
00:16:36.574 --> 00:16:38.444
Good evening. students.

401
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:40.922
It's a new year and a new moon.

402
00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:43.922
And Monster High
welcomes you back.

403
00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:53.052
Is that normal?

404
00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:55.618
Yeah.
The school's kind of alive.

405
00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:58.226
Don't worry.
It's mostly friendly.

406
00:16:58.313 --> 00:16:59.748
Mostly.

407
00:16:59.835 --> 00:17:00.965
In the manner
of our four founders.

408
00:17:01.052 --> 00:17:04.444
tonight.
we embrace prefecte electio.

409
00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:08.835
the naming of this year's
student leader. your prefect.

410
00:17:08.922 --> 00:17:11.226
As always. your school
will choose the student

411
00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:15.009
it finds most worthy.
an inspiring leader

412
00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:17.791
honorable in both
word and deed.

413
00:17:17.878 --> 00:17:19.748
Yeah. except the school
always just picks

414
00:17:19.835 --> 00:17:22.052
the most popular kid.

415
00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:23.965
Let the candidates
be revealed.

416
00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:26.139
Elementals.
- That's our cue.

417
00:17:26.226 --> 00:17:27.748
Yes.

418
00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:29.835
As we look to a new year.

419
00:17:29.922 --> 00:17:32.357
we welcome
the elements of change:

420
00:17:32.444 --> 00:17:36.139
fire and water.

421
00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:52.226
Power of fire.

422
00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:06.226
Power of water.

423
00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:21.922
House of spirits.
show us your choices.

424
00:18:33.531 --> 00:18:34.791
Clawdeen Wolf.

425
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.313
What?

426
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.660
Yeah.
Way to go. Claw.

427
00:18:40.748 --> 00:18:42.748
- Wow.
- Yeah. Clawdeen!

428
00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:45.313
- Whoo!
- Way to go.

429
00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:54.487
Competing with Clawdeen
for prefect will be...

430
00:18:54.574 --> 00:18:57.139
Toralei Stripe.

431
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.487
It's on. Kumon.

432
00:19:06.574 --> 00:19:08.226
Oh. you know it.

433
00:19:12.878 --> 00:19:15.660
So how exactly do we compete?

434
00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:17.704
OK. it's very simple.

435
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.400
These are tally skulls.

436
00:19:19.487 --> 00:19:22.574
As you can see. they start out
pretty equally at first.

437
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.270
But the school is watching
to see who's the best leader.

438
00:19:25.357 --> 00:19:27.183
It's how the school scores
a prefect competition.

439
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.878
It'll observe you
for the next few days

440
00:19:28.965 --> 00:19:30.704
and then make its choice.

441
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:32.617
First one to the top wins.

442
00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:35.313
My mom was prefect.

443
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.965
I never thought I'd walk
in her shoes like this.

444
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:40.313
Hey.
This is huge for you.

445
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.791
Prefect is the voice
of the whole student body.

446
00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:45.139
Am I even ready for this?

447
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.052
Toralei. were you excited
to be chosen?

448
00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:48.791
Of course.
I'm thrilled to be chosen.

449
00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:51.226
And I already thought
of my slogan.

450
00:19:51.313 --> 00:19:53.183
"Protect Monsters."

451
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.357
because that's what
I intend to do.

452
00:19:57.444 --> 00:20:02.444
Tell me. what do you call
an oblivious lycan?

453
00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:05.704
An unaware-wolf.

454
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:07.009
Oh. yeah.
That's good.

455
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.573
Aww.

456
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.400
She can't win.

457
00:20:13.487 --> 00:20:15.139
She can't.

458
00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:22.009
Show what's good
with no mistake.

459
00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:24.922
and on this page.
a likeness make.

460
00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:37.139
"The only way to have
a friend is to be one."

461
00:20:37.226 --> 00:20:40.748
Now we have a slogan
of our own.

462
00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:43.965
- Thank you.

463
00:20:44.052 --> 00:20:44.573
Aww.

464
00:20:46.617 --> 00:20:49.487
I really need to get that
under control.

465
00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:50.922
- Hey.
- Ah!

466
00:20:51.009 --> 00:20:53.270
Toralei just told
the Gory Gazette that.

467
00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.791
"[in English accent] Witchcraft
is a filthy human habit

468
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.009
that puts all monsters
at risk."

469
00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:57.183
What?

470
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.487
They want Clawdeen
to comment.

471
00:20:58.573 --> 00:21:00.313
Why. that catty little cat!

472
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.487
Easy.

473
00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:03.530
Breathe.

474
00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:07.400
Cross my heart.
which is in a jar in my room.

475
00:21:07.486 --> 00:21:12.922
I will handle the press for you
as your campaign manager.

476
00:21:13.009 --> 00:21:14.313
- Thank you.
- All right.

477
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.704
We'll need to hit the press
back with a statement

478
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:17.009
immediately.
something along the lines of--

479
00:21:17.096 --> 00:21:20.009
OK. we can't let some cat

480
00:21:20.096 --> 00:21:23.226
with trust issues
ruin Monster High.

481
00:21:23.313 --> 00:21:24.791
Let's win this.

482
00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:33.139
"Filthy human habit"?

483
00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:36.791
Oh. I'll show her
a filthy human habit.

484
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:43.096
Dirt and dust and ash and mud
form an ugly hater's mug.

485
00:21:53.573 --> 00:21:55.139
Not too shabby.

486
00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:56.660
- Oh! I was--
- It's OK.

487
00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:58.052
I get it.

488
00:21:58.139 --> 00:21:59.443
But I know something
even better.

489
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.965
Check it out.

490
00:22:02.052 --> 00:22:04.660
Bone and breath. hand in heel.

491
00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:07.573
make another one as real.

492
00:22:14.313 --> 00:22:15.748
What?

493
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.573
It's an automaton.
just a dumb copy.

494
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.270
They're hilarious.

495
00:22:20.357 --> 00:22:21.704
but no smarter than the mask
it's made from.

496
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:23.704
Watch.

497
00:22:28.835 --> 00:22:30.183
- That's--
- Witchcraft.

498
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.139
It's why I transferred here.

499
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.052
Ever since I heard about you.
I thought.

500
00:22:34.139 --> 00:22:36.835
maybe it'd be safe
for someone like me.

501
00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:39.399
It was.
But now--

502
00:22:39.486 --> 00:22:41.704
Less so.

503
00:22:41.791 --> 00:22:43.660
It's so unfair.

504
00:22:43.748 --> 00:22:46.965
Monsters are always afraid of
what they don't understand.

505
00:22:47.052 --> 00:22:48.878
They try to make
you think it's you.

506
00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:50.443
"One day. you'll understand."

507
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.573
Exactly.

508
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.270
You should hear my father.

509
00:22:53.357 --> 00:22:56.704
"One day when you're older.
you can do it your way."

510
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:59.313
Well. I do understand.

511
00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:01.835
And I want more.

512
00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.313
Yeah.

513
00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.226
I want them to see
what we see.

514
00:23:05.313 --> 00:23:09.009
that witchcraft
can be beautiful.

515
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.835
When I was younger.
I used to go to the library.

516
00:23:14.922 --> 00:23:16.878
There was a dusty corner

517
00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:18.486
stacked with
old forgotten books.

518
00:23:18.573 --> 00:23:21.617
And one day. I found this
little spell book there.

519
00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:25.270
It just spoke to me.
And I knew--

520
00:23:25.356 --> 00:23:27.573
That you could
never tell anyone.

521
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.009
Yes.

522
00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:30.704
I think you get it.

523
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:33.270

You too. Ellis.

566
00:25:36.443 --> 00:25:39.096
Clawdeen.
can I ask you something?

567
00:25:39.183 --> 00:25:41.139
Frankie.
I think we're past

568
00:25:41.225 --> 00:25:42.704
the asking to ask me
something stage.

569
00:25:44.312 --> 00:25:47.052
I'm wondering about
my upgrades.

570
00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:50.009
Emerson said the purpose
of life is not to be happy.

571
00:25:50.096 --> 00:25:51.835
It's to be useful.

572
00:25:51.922 --> 00:25:54.225
to have it make
some difference you were here.

573
00:25:54.312 --> 00:25:57.096
That's totally you.

574
00:25:57.183 --> 00:26:01.139
I was just hoping with
my new upgrades.

575
00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:02.660
I just--

576
00:26:02.748 --> 00:26:04.922
I mean. I thought
being more monster

577
00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:07.009
could help me do that too.

578
00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:09.182
You wanted to be
more monster

579
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:11.009
because of Ralph Waldo Emerson?

580
00:26:11.096 --> 00:26:12.312
No.

581
00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:13.530
Yes.

582
00:26:13.617 --> 00:26:15.356
I don't know.

583
00:26:15.443 --> 00:26:16.704
I think I may read
too many books.

584
00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:22.617
Frankie. I'm sorry.
One second.

585
00:26:22.704 --> 00:26:26.443
Cleo is hammering me
with campaign questions.

586
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.399
OK. there.
I'm done.

587
00:26:29.878 --> 00:26:31.660
Almost done. Sorry.

588
00:26:31.748 --> 00:26:33.791
I know you're super busy.

589
00:26:33.878 --> 00:26:36.399
We'll talk tomorrow.

590
00:26:41.878 --> 00:26:43.096
Please let Bloodgood
be asleep.

591
00:26:43.182 --> 00:26:45.052
Please let Bloodgood be asleep.

592
00:27:05.052 --> 00:27:08.835
You missed curfew.

593
00:27:18.182 --> 00:27:20.269
What?

594
00:27:24.443 --> 00:27:26.399
- What are you doing here?

595
00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:50.835
<i>What's happening?</i>

596
00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:53.486
So my new eyes are
having focusing issues.

597
00:27:53.573 --> 00:27:56.052
I mean. just yesterday.
I thought Heath was a candle.

598
00:27:56.138 --> 00:27:58.922
But I'm pretty sure
those were witches.

599
00:27:59.009 --> 00:28:00.965
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

600
00:28:05.835 --> 00:28:08.009
Well. this has been quite
the evening. hasn't it?

601
00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:10.052
A portal was breached

602
00:28:10.138 --> 00:28:13.095
right before Frankie fried
the entire campus power grid.

603
00:28:13.182 --> 00:28:14.312
Sorry about that.

604
00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:17.269
To open a portal.

605
00:28:17.356 --> 00:28:21.269
that would require incredibly
powerful witchcraft.

606
00:28:21.356 --> 00:28:22.660
Oh. thank goodness.

607
00:28:22.748 --> 00:28:24.965
Oh. come on.

608
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:26.443
Why would witches
invade your room?

609
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:27.617
I don't know.
I wasn't there. I--

610
00:28:27.704 --> 00:28:29.356
And where were you?

611
00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:31.835
Off partying with your coven?

612
00:28:31.922 --> 00:28:34.182
- What is going on here?
- Are you OK?

613
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:35.530
Yeah.

614
00:28:35.617 --> 00:28:37.443
Toralei.
this is a private meeting.

615
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.748
It doesn't concern you.

616
00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:40.225
Head mistress.
Monster High was attacked.

617
00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:42.269
That concerns all of us.

618
00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:45.138
And as prefect elect.
I'm entitled to know the facts.

619
00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.356
And as the other
prefect elect.

620
00:28:47.443 --> 00:28:49.269
why don't you mind
your own beeswax?

621
00:28:49.356 --> 00:28:50.660
Do you think
it's a coincidence

622
00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:53.486
that witches came looking
for the one student

623
00:28:53.573 --> 00:28:54.573
known for practicing
witchcraft?

624
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.138
Enough. It's late.

625
00:28:56.225 --> 00:28:57.704
Return to your dorms.

626
00:28:57.791 --> 00:28:59.269
Headmistress.
hear me out. please.

627
00:28:59.356 --> 00:29:02.225
Witches and witchcraft
are dangerous.

628
00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:03.922
And I think you know it.

629
00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:06.835
We can't just live in fear
of what we don't understand.

630
00:29:06.922 --> 00:29:08.269
We're better than that.

631
00:29:08.356 --> 00:29:10.791
If you play with matches.
you get burned.

632
00:29:10.878 --> 00:29:14.008
We need to protect monsters

633
00:29:14.095 --> 00:29:16.965

You've both given me
a lot to think about.

687
00:31:59.225 --> 00:32:02.660
I firmly believe in inclusion.

688
00:32:02.748 --> 00:32:05.399
But if witches can somehow
sense witchcraft.

689
00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:09.877

then until we know more.

690
00:32:09.964 --> 00:32:13.095
I'm enacting a school-wide ban
on all witchcraft.

691
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.312
Now. everyone to bed.

692
00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:24.486
I'm sorry.

693
00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:30.530
- Good morning. Monster High.

694
00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:34.530
<i>Fearleading tryouts continue
on Skull Field at sundown.</i>

695
00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:37.269
<i>And prefect selection
has begun.</i>

696
00:32:37.356 --> 00:32:38.964
<i>The candidates are set.</i>

697
00:32:39.051 --> 00:32:41.443
<i>and the sands of choice
are pouring in.</i>

698
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.399
<i>Who will our great school
choose this year?</i>

699
00:32:44.486 --> 00:32:47.399
<i>Find out in two days.</i>

700
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.660
<i>No. Seriously. two days.</i>

701
00:32:55.486 --> 00:32:57.573
I'm fine. Dad.
You don't need to worry.

702
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.269
<i>You're my little ghoul.
Of course. I need to worry.</i>

703
00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:02.486
<i>If there's any more trouble.
I'm bringing you home.</i>

704
00:33:02.573 --> 00:33:04.008
<i>End of discussion.</i>

705
00:33:04.095 --> 00:33:05.921
Dad. no.
That's totally unreasonable.

706
00:33:06.008 --> 00:33:07.443
- Oh. that's my mobile.

707
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.660
<i>Love you.</i>

708
00:33:11.138 --> 00:33:12.312
Perfect.

709
00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:14.225
You OK?

710
00:33:14.312 --> 00:33:15.704
It's not just me
I'm worried about.

711
00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.530
There were other witches now.

712
00:33:17.617 --> 00:33:18.704
That transfer student. Ellis--

713
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.921
There's another
witch vampire?

714
00:33:20.008 --> 00:33:21.095
Yeah.

715
00:33:21.182 --> 00:33:22.964
He's pretty cool. actually.

716
00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:25.356
We've been talking.

717
00:33:25.443 --> 00:33:27.617
You've just got to win this
prefect thing and end this.

718
00:33:27.704 --> 00:33:29.356
Then--
- Hi.

719
00:33:29.443 --> 00:33:32.399
Hey. Um...

720
00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:34.877
What's up?

721
00:33:34.964 --> 00:33:35.921
What's wrong?

722
00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:41.182
Toralei's pulled ahead.
and not by a little.

723
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:42.530
- What?
- How?

724
00:33:42.617 --> 00:33:43.704
I don't know how.

725
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.964
No part of me has
ever been popular.

726
00:33:47.051 --> 00:33:49.877
This can't be happening.
We have to stop her.

727
00:33:49.964 --> 00:33:51.573
How do we stop her?
What do we do?

728
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.399
Draculaura. think about it.

729
00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:59.225
Witches broke in
looking for you.

730
00:33:59.312 --> 00:34:01.704
What if they were somehow--
I don't know.

731
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.008
drawn to your magic.
like Bloodgood said?

732
00:34:03.095 --> 00:34:05.269
I had nothing
to do with this.

733
00:34:05.356 --> 00:34:07.747
I know that. but no one's
thinking rationally.

734
00:34:07.834 --> 00:34:09.138
So we need to make them.

735
00:34:09.225 --> 00:34:10.356
I could research
the good witch crafters

736
00:34:10.443 --> 00:34:12.225
in the world and then
post it on Eek Tok.

737
00:34:12.312 --> 00:34:15.138
No one's listening.
They're just afraid.

738
00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:17.051
Right. so that probably
wouldn't be helpful.

739
00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:19.530
Then maybe posters.

740
00:34:19.617 --> 00:34:21.790
So what are you saying?

741
00:34:21.877 --> 00:34:25.790
Just...
witchcraft is banned.

742
00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:27.877
so can't you just play along

743
00:34:27.964 --> 00:34:29.312
until I win
and we can sort this out?

744
00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:30.530
That's a good point.

745
00:34:30.617 --> 00:34:32.617
Play along?

746
00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:34.095
You mean go back
in the broom closet?

747
00:34:34.182 --> 00:34:35.617
What?

748
00:34:35.703 --> 00:34:37.617
No. that's not what I said.
I just--

749
00:34:37.703 --> 00:34:40.573
I'm a witch.
This is who I am.

750
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.573
No apologies. remember?

751
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.573
That's also a good point.

752
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.356
If Toralei wins.

753
00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:50.356
I won't be able to make a case
for acceptance at all.

754
00:34:50.443 --> 00:34:51.964
Yeah.

755
00:34:52.051 --> 00:34:54.312
I get it.

756
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:57.790
You have monsters to protect.

757
00:34:57.877 --> 00:35:00.138
Wait. No.
What?

758
00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:04.617
So that's a no
on the posters?

759
00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:14.443
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

760
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.747
Can we talk?

761
00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:19.356
It's like everyone
gets to be their best

762
00:35:19.443 --> 00:35:23.356
authentic selves. except us.

763
00:35:23.443 --> 00:35:25.921
It makes me wonder.

764
00:35:26.008 --> 00:35:29.312
what are we even
doing here at all?

765
00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:32.051
Listen.

766
00:35:32.138 --> 00:35:33.182
I need to tell you something.

767
00:35:33.269 --> 00:35:37.399
Just promise me you won't
totally freak out.

768
00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:39.399
Yeah. OK.

769
00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:40.747
OK.

770
00:35:52.138 --> 00:35:53.834
I'm not a vampire.

771
00:35:53.921 --> 00:35:56.616
I'm a human--
a human witch. to be precise.

772
00:35:56.703 --> 00:35:58.659
No. no. no. no.
That's not possible.

773
00:35:58.747 --> 00:35:59.964
How?
- OK.

774
00:36:00.051 --> 00:36:01.659
Uh. you're freaking out
a little.

775
00:36:01.747 --> 00:36:03.659
- Were you part of the attack?
- No. That wasn't me.

776
00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:05.659
Then what do you want?

777
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:07.790
There are different witch
factions. different covens.

778
00:36:07.877 --> 00:36:10.747
Some--most. actually.

779
00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.747
want war to destroy
the vampires.

780
00:36:12.834 --> 00:36:14.877
They're the ones
who tried to kidnap you.

781
00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.790
But my mother. she's different.

782
00:36:16.877 --> 00:36:19.877
She leads the Salem Coven.

783
00:36:19.964 --> 00:36:22.399
Your mother is Queen Zamara?

784
00:36:22.486 --> 00:36:25.572
Yes.
And she wants peace. like you.

785
00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:27.703
She sent me here to talk to you
before the others found you.

786
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.747
It's just my timing was a mess.

787
00:36:32.572 --> 00:36:34.834
This war is so old.

788
00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:38.008
Not even the undead
remember how it started.

789
00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:41.269
A vampire fell in love
with a witch.

790
00:36:41.356 --> 00:36:45.138
He wanted to be human for her.
so she made him a gift.

791
00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:50.312
a mortality spell
to grant his wish.

792
00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:52.834
But when he cast it.
something went wrong.

793
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.834
It didn't make a vampire human.

794
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:57.356
It killed vampires instead.

795
00:36:57.443 --> 00:36:59.572
Thousands died.

796
00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:02.747
It was a mortality curse.

797
00:37:02.834 --> 00:37:03.877
The vampires
blamed the witches.

798
00:37:03.964 --> 00:37:05.834
And witches blamed vampires.

799
00:37:05.921 --> 00:37:09.703
And centuries of bloodshed
and revenge have followed.

800
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.529
If we can work together now.

801
00:37:12.616 --> 00:37:15.529
we can end this war forever.

802
00:37:15.616 --> 00:37:18.486
My mom wants you to join her
and make the case for peace.

803
00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:22.486
Just hear her out.

804
00:37:37.225 --> 00:37:41.877
♪ There's only one
of two ways to go ♪

805
00:37:41.964 --> 00:37:46.877
♪ And one of them
feels impossible ♪

806
00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:49.485
♪ But I know what feels right ♪

807
00:37:49.572 --> 00:37:52.138
♪ I feel it deep inside ♪

808
00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:57.747
♪ And I think that the time
is getting close ♪

809
00:38:06.225 --> 00:38:08.790
Let's go meet your mom.

810
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.008
<i>Good morning. monsters.</i>

811
00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:17.659
<i>Werecat volleyball is canceled
until all claws are trimmed.</i>

812
00:38:17.747 --> 00:38:20.312
<i>We mean it this time.
or no more balls.</i>

813
00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:22.269
<i>There's a casketball team
bake sale</i>

814
00:38:22.356 --> 00:38:24.008
<i>in the main hall at lunch.</i>

815
00:38:24.095 --> 00:38:27.877
<i>And all witchcraft is banned
until further notice.</i>

816
00:38:27.964 --> 00:38:30.747
<i>Go. Demons!</i>

817
00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:34.138
- Is she up?
- I haven't seen her.

818
00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:39.008
What's that?

819
00:38:39.095 --> 00:38:40.790
- Wait. she did what?
- Shh.

820
00:38:40.877 --> 00:38:42.312
She ran away.
- Why?

821
00:38:42.399 --> 00:38:44.399
She said she's going
to meet with witches

822
00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:46.399
and talk about peace.
- Oh. my Ra. She's gone rogue.

823
00:38:47.877 --> 00:38:49.095
People are not going
to be happy with her.

824
00:38:49.182 --> 00:38:51.182
- Except for Toralei.
- Yeah. witch party?

825
00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:53.138
That cat's going to be stoked.

826
00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:55.442
Draculaura is now
a political millstone.

827
00:38:55.529 --> 00:38:57.356
Cleo. you've got
to cut her loose.

828
00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:59.225
This is not how we win
the prefect race.

829
00:38:59.312 --> 00:39:02.747
Sorry. yeah. but that's
not the worst of it.

830
00:39:10.442 --> 00:39:12.616
She says it's supposed to
fool people into thinking

831
00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:13.659
she's here. but sick.

832
00:39:15.095 --> 00:39:17.747
So it looks like her.
like a clone?

833
00:39:17.834 --> 00:39:20.095
She made it to play sick
and cover for her.

834
00:39:20.182 --> 00:39:23.747
But all it does is play sick. badly.

835
00:39:23.834 --> 00:39:25.398
So when Bloodgood knocked--

836
00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:27.138
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

837
00:39:27.225 --> 00:39:30.398
Good morning. ghouls.

838
00:39:30.485 --> 00:39:32.312
What a surprise.

839
00:39:32.398 --> 00:39:34.921
So early.

840
00:39:35.008 --> 00:39:37.834
How you are. headmistress?
Miss head-- good-- good--

841
00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:39.703
head miss--
- I'm good. dears.

842
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.572
Is Draculaura here?

843
00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:44.095
I know yesterday was tough.
so I just wanted to check in.

844
00:39:46.572 --> 00:39:49.008
Um. she's sick.

845
00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:51.964
- Sick?

846
00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:53.834
Oh.
That kind of sick.

847
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:55.529
Been there.

848
00:39:55.616 --> 00:39:57.442
Feel better. dear.

849
00:39:57.529 --> 00:39:59.485
- Oh. man.
<i>- So Bloodgood bought it?</i>

850
00:39:59.572 --> 00:40:00.442
We're in the clear?

851
00:40:00.529 --> 00:40:03.312
Yes and no.

852
00:40:03.398 --> 00:40:04.659
It gets worse.

853
00:40:04.747 --> 00:40:07.398
Ta-ta.

854
00:40:07.485 --> 00:40:09.442
<i>Draculaura. are you home?</i>

855
00:40:09.529 --> 00:40:12.355
Mr. Dracula.

856
00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:13.182
Hi.

857
00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:14.659
<i>Is my daughter there?</i>

858
00:40:14.747 --> 00:40:16.877
She--
- Went out.

859
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.225
<i>Frankie. are you not well?</i>

860
00:40:21.312 --> 00:40:22.442
Yeah.

861
00:40:22.529 --> 00:40:24.834
Just. um. allergies.

862
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:30.225
And I ate cheese.

863
00:40:30.312 --> 00:40:32.225
<i>Ah.</i>

864
00:40:32.312 --> 00:40:35.312
<i>Well. actually. it's better
I speak to you two.</i>

865
00:40:35.398 --> 00:40:37.398
<i>After all the horrible
business there.</i>

866
00:40:37.485 --> 00:40:39.529
<i>I thought it might be
nice for Draculaura</i>

867
00:40:39.616 --> 00:40:42.921
<i>to celebrate her birthday
the way that she wanted.</i>

868
00:40:43.008 --> 00:40:45.790
<i>So I canceled the big party
I was planning.</i>

869
00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:48.964
<i>And I'm coming tomorrow to
throw her a little soiree</i>

870
00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:50.877
<i>for just her good friends.</i>

871
00:40:50.964 --> 00:40:53.485
<i>She turns 1.600 at midnight.</i>

872
00:40:53.572 --> 00:40:56.008
<i>She will come of age
into full vampireness</i>

873
00:40:56.095 --> 00:40:58.572
<i>exactly as she had hoped.</i>

874
00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:00.572
<i>She's going to be
so very pleased with me.</i>

875
00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:02.398
You're coming here?

876
00:41:02.485 --> 00:41:03.572
<i>Yes.</i>

877
00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:05.442
- Tomorrow?
- OK.

878
00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.225
So basically. we have
less than two days

879
00:41:07.311 --> 00:41:09.311
to bring Draculaura home before
she flakes on her own party

880
00:41:09.398 --> 00:41:10.659
and is busted for
sneaking off campus

881
00:41:10.747 --> 00:41:12.008
and conspiring with witches.

882
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.138
And destroys
her life forever.

883
00:41:13.225 --> 00:41:15.095
- Good times.
- Yeah.

884
00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:17.138
You sarcopha-got to be
kidding me.

885
00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:19.442
I'm calling her right now.

886
00:41:21.747 --> 00:41:24.790
She left her phone.
We can't even track her.

887
00:41:24.877 --> 00:41:27.138
"Royal pain"?

888
00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:28.659
So where do we even
begin to look?

889
00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:29.790
Aren't there. like.
a ton of covens?

890
00:41:29.877 --> 00:41:32.008
3.017 on six continents.

891
00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:33.442
There was one in Antarctica.

892
00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:35.182
but it got ransacked
by bewitched penguins.

893
00:41:35.268 --> 00:41:37.095
True story.
So probably not that one.

894
00:41:37.182 --> 00:41:40.008
It's OK.
I know where to start.

895
00:41:45.442 --> 00:41:47.529
I probably should have
used less oomph.

896
00:41:47.616 --> 00:41:49.225
Probably?

897
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:52.572
Breaking and entering is
never good for campaigns.

898
00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:54.095
Ellis is missing too.

899
00:41:54.182 --> 00:41:55.572
If he left with Draculaura.

900
00:41:55.659 --> 00:41:57.529
there might be clues
to where they went.

901
00:41:57.616 --> 00:41:59.138
Spread out.

902
00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.051
Sweet.

903
00:42:01.138 --> 00:42:02.747
- Keep watch.
- Right.

904
00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:04.224
And if someone comes. eat them.

905
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:06.398
Yes. What?
No.

906
00:42:06.485 --> 00:42:08.311
Just-- just whistle
or knock at the door.

907
00:42:08.398 --> 00:42:10.051
And then take
a little nibble?

908
00:42:10.138 --> 00:42:12.442
No.
No nibbling.

909
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:13.529
Aww.

910
00:42:20.485 --> 00:42:21.877
Hey.

911
00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:22.747
His suitcase is still here.

912
00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:24.442
So he left in a hurry.

913
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:28.616
Nothing.

914
00:42:28.703 --> 00:42:30.572
Wait.

915
00:42:32.442 --> 00:42:34.182
There's something under here.

916
00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:37.790
98134.

917
00:42:37.877 --> 00:42:40.659
Five digits--that's called a
postal code in the human world.

918
00:42:40.747 --> 00:42:42.182
colloquially known
as zip codes.

919
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:43.529
My parts don't know this place.

920
00:42:43.616 --> 00:42:47.008
98134 is in a place
called "Seetle."

921
00:42:47.095 --> 00:42:49.095
Seattle.

922
00:42:49.181 --> 00:42:50.877
Why would
a Monster High student

923
00:42:50.964 --> 00:42:52.659
have a secret return address
in the human world?

924
00:42:52.747 --> 00:42:54.181
Who is this guy?

925
00:42:54.268 --> 00:42:56.747
Only one way to find out.

926
00:42:56.834 --> 00:42:59.485
As campaign manager. I'm
aiding in this criminal action

927
00:42:59.572 --> 00:43:00.703
under protest.

928
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:01.921
Clawdeen. Cleo's right.

929
00:43:02.008 --> 00:43:03.138
It's too dangerous out there.

930
00:43:03.224 --> 00:43:04.964
Believe me.
I know.

931
00:43:05.051 --> 00:43:06.398
I'll be careful.

932
00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:09.008
Fine. but you have
to be back by dinner.

933
00:43:09.095 --> 00:43:12.008
We're making 400 Clawdeen Wolf
campaign cookies.

934
00:43:12.095 --> 00:43:14.181
We're using my cake printer
to put your picture on them.

935
00:43:14.268 --> 00:43:15.877
- You have a cake printer?
- Uh-huh.

936
00:43:15.964 --> 00:43:18.095
And you have to hand them out
for dessert.

937
00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:19.790
This is the kind
of student approval

938
00:43:19.877 --> 00:43:21.051
that you need to get back
in the prefect race.

939
00:43:21.138 --> 00:43:23.355
I know.

940
00:43:23.442 --> 00:43:25.747
I know.

941
00:43:25.834 --> 00:43:28.268
Why do you have to go alone?

942
00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:29.616
Can you do this?

943
00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:41.224
That is still very cool.

944
00:43:41.311 --> 00:43:42.529
You guys wait here. OK?

945
00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:43.921
I'm the human.

946
00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:45.703
This is my job.

947
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:49.834
Wait.
One more thing.

948
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:52.703
I'm sending this
little gal with you.

949
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.224
Her name is Bastet.

950
00:43:54.311 --> 00:43:56.268
after the Egyptian goddess
of protection.

951
00:43:56.355 --> 00:43:58.137
She can detect magical energy.

952
00:43:58.224 --> 00:44:00.529
which might come in handy
for finding witches.

953
00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:02.442
Good thinking.

954
00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:05.008
Thanks. Cleo.

955
00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:10.051
See you all at dinner.

956
00:44:10.137 --> 00:44:11.964
Be safe.

957
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:13.964
Always.

958
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:36.529
Coleman Eves.

959
00:44:36.616 --> 00:44:39.181
Yo. I just saw her.
She's here.

960
00:44:39.268 --> 00:44:40.616
Dude. I'm not arguing
with you right now.

961
00:44:40.703 --> 00:44:41.834
- Shh.
- You guys are being too loud.

962
00:44:41.921 --> 00:44:43.485
Yeah. um.

963
00:44:43.572 --> 00:44:45.485
just because my
human senses are weak.

964
00:44:45.572 --> 00:44:47.355
doesn't mean they don't exist.

965
00:44:47.442 --> 00:44:48.790
I asked you to wait for me.

966
00:44:48.877 --> 00:44:50.572
Well. technically.
we never agreed.

967
00:44:50.659 --> 00:44:52.877
- We're here to help.
- I said this was a bad idea.

968
00:44:52.964 --> 00:44:54.572
Yes. it's too dangerous.

969
00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:56.877
That's why we're in disguise.

970
00:44:56.964 --> 00:45:00.137
Sunglasses are
not a disguise.

971
00:45:00.224 --> 00:45:04.181
Claws. I couldn't
let you do this alone.

972
00:45:06.008 --> 00:45:08.094
All right.

973
00:45:08.181 --> 00:45:11.268
Well. uh. keep your hoods up
for your own sake.

974
00:45:11.355 --> 00:45:16.268
And just try to
act unnatural. OK?

975
00:45:16.355 --> 00:45:18.398
- OK.
- Yeah.

976
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.834
OK. are you getting this?

977
00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.094
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

978
00:45:25.181 --> 00:45:27.050
<i>Coleman Eves.</i>

979
00:45:27.137 --> 00:45:30.094
<i>Green is the color
of tomorrow.</i>

980
00:45:32.268 --> 00:45:33.572
What's that sound?

981
00:45:33.659 --> 00:45:35.008
It's Heath eating.

982
00:45:35.094 --> 00:45:36.442
Dog meat is fire.

983
00:45:36.529 --> 00:45:38.268
Oh.
No. it's not dog.

984
00:45:38.355 --> 00:45:40.355
The name. hot dog was coined
in the 1860s

985
00:45:40.442 --> 00:45:42.137
when German immigrants
began settling

986
00:45:42.224 --> 00:45:44.181
long thin sausages which they
nicknamed dachshund sausages.

987
00:45:44.268 --> 00:45:46.094
like the dog breed.

988
00:45:46.181 --> 00:45:48.398
Dachshund is fire.

989
00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:49.703
OK. Enjoy.

990
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.311
Mm-hmm.

991
00:45:51.398 --> 00:45:53.572
It looks fancy in there.

992
00:45:53.659 --> 00:45:54.877
<i>Coleman Eves--</i>

993
00:45:54.964 --> 00:45:56.442
It is fancy.

994
00:45:56.529 --> 00:46:00.137
<i>Fueled by timeless
botanical secrets.</i>

995
00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.877
<i>Wait. Guys.</i>

996
00:46:01.964 --> 00:46:03.790
What's happening?

997
00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:11.572
Guys. I think Bastet
senses magic somewhere.

998
00:46:11.659 --> 00:46:14.485
No.
Actually. everywhere.

999
00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:18.007
Wait.
Coleman Eves?

1000
00:46:18.094 --> 00:46:19.485
It's an anagram.

1001
00:46:19.572 --> 00:46:21.921
It's an anagram?
What's an anagram?

1002
00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:23.747
It's a word or phrase
that uses the same letters

1003
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:28.094
to spell different things.
like a secret message.

1004
00:46:28.181 --> 00:46:30.703
Salem Coven.
Wait. The company's a coven?

1005
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.355
The mother of all covens
from the Salem Witch Trials.

1006
00:46:33.442 --> 00:46:36.007
The Salem Witch Trials?

1007
00:46:36.094 --> 00:46:37.921
In 1692 colonial Massachusetts.

1008
00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:40.398
200 people were accused
of practicing witchcraft.

1009
00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:42.398
19 witches were executed.

1010
00:46:42.485 --> 00:46:44.442
So humans treat witches as
bad as they treat monsters?

1011
00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:46.181
Yeah. and witches
treat monsters worse.

1012
00:46:46.268 --> 00:46:47.877
Clawdeen. get out of there now.

1013
00:46:47.963 --> 00:46:49.572
<i>Draculaura is here alone.</i>

1014
00:46:49.659 --> 00:46:51.181
Well. we need
a better plan than walking

1015
00:46:51.268 --> 00:46:53.485
<i>right to the mouth
of a coven.</i>

1016
00:46:53.572 --> 00:46:55.790
<i>Claws.
- Coleman Eves.</i>

1017
00:46:55.877 --> 00:46:58.355
<i>- Clawdeen. what's happening?
- To live is to grow.</i>

1018
00:46:58.442 --> 00:47:01.834
I know someone who can help.

1019
00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.834
Come on.

1020
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.311
Hi. Mom.
- Ellis. Hi.

1021
00:47:12.398 --> 00:47:16.355
Darling. you're back.

1022
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:19.659
And. oh. my.

1023
00:47:19.747 --> 00:47:21.572
- Oh. um...
- Oh.

1024
00:47:21.659 --> 00:47:24.355
Not a hugger?
Forgive me.

1025
00:47:24.442 --> 00:47:27.268
Draculaura.
daughter of Dracula.

1026
00:47:27.355 --> 00:47:29.442
princess of vampires.

1027
00:47:29.529 --> 00:47:33.007
and budding practitioner
of our own magical arts.

1028
00:47:33.094 --> 00:47:34.398
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1029
00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:35.920
You too. your majesty.

1030
00:47:36.007 --> 00:47:37.920
Oh. that's very proper.

1031
00:47:38.007 --> 00:47:39.877
We don't really go for
titles around here.

1032
00:47:39.963 --> 00:47:41.790
It would freak out
the stockholders.

1033
00:47:41.877 --> 00:47:43.659
So just call me Z.

1034
00:47:43.747 --> 00:47:47.659
Um. OK. Z.

1035
00:47:47.747 --> 00:47:50.529
Ellis tells me we have
a common interest--peace.

1036
00:47:50.616 --> 00:47:52.181
Yes.

1037
00:47:52.268 --> 00:47:54.920
Monsters and witches
aren't so different.

1038
00:47:55.007 --> 00:47:58.834
We've always been persecuted by
those who don't understand us.

1039
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.485
- Are these potions?
- No.

1040
00:48:00.572 --> 00:48:02.137
Those are herbs.

1041
00:48:02.224 --> 00:48:03.747
Magic herbs.

1042
00:48:03.834 --> 00:48:05.355
Just regular herbs.

1043
00:48:05.442 --> 00:48:07.485
We learned a few things.

1044
00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:09.920
People are terrified
of illness and death.

1045
00:48:10.007 --> 00:48:13.834
so we used our craft to design
longevity products for them.

1046
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.007
So you're profiting off
of the fears

1047
00:48:16.094 --> 00:48:17.485
of the very people
that used to fear you?

1048
00:48:17.572 --> 00:48:19.659
Yes.
Exactly.

1049
00:48:19.747 --> 00:48:22.224
Here.
Try this.

1050
00:48:22.311 --> 00:48:23.963
It's turmeric. jasmine.

1051
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.659
and dandelion-infused
rejuvenation elixir.

1052
00:48:26.747 --> 00:48:28.747
Your secret botanicals?

1053
00:48:28.834 --> 00:48:31.747
Well. it wouldn't be a secret
if I just told. you would it?

1054
00:48:31.834 --> 00:48:33.224
Cheers.

1055
00:48:35.485 --> 00:48:37.485
I know.

1056
00:48:37.572 --> 00:48:39.050
It's terrible.

1057
00:48:39.137 --> 00:48:41.703
I've always suspected
it's the dandelion.

1058
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.442
But it is guaranteed to
add years to your life.

1059
00:48:45.529 --> 00:48:47.876
not that you need it.

1060
00:48:47.963 --> 00:48:50.747
This is the type of know-how
that we can share with you.

1061
00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:52.485
We can help each other
if we could just

1062
00:48:52.572 --> 00:48:56.094
get past our conflict.

1063
00:48:56.181 --> 00:48:58.268
I'm not what you expected.
am I?

1064
00:48:58.355 --> 00:49:01.050
No.
You're definitely not.

1065
00:49:01.137 --> 00:49:05.050
Draculaura. I see
so much potential in you

1066
00:49:05.137 --> 00:49:08.529
to be a leader.
to change the world.

1067
00:49:08.616 --> 00:49:13.311
I think it is time that
you learn your true power.

1068
00:49:13.398 --> 00:49:16.224
Tomorrow. witches from
all over the world

1069
00:49:16.311 --> 00:49:18.616
are coming here for a conclave.

1070
00:49:18.703 --> 00:49:20.485
It has always been my dream--

1071
00:49:20.572 --> 00:49:23.355
I can speak to them.
explain that

1072
00:49:23.442 --> 00:49:25.311
not all vampires want war. that
there are reasonable voices

1073
00:49:25.398 --> 00:49:27.963
on our side too.

1074
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:31.137
That could make
all the difference.

1075
00:49:31.224 --> 00:49:34.442
You are even more impressive
than I expected.

1076
00:49:34.529 --> 00:49:36.094
Thank you.

1077
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:38.094
We have a beautiful guest room
set up for you.

1078
00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:39.833
Melissandra will show you.

1079
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.137
So rest up.

1080
00:49:41.224 --> 00:49:42.703
We have a big day tomorrow.

1081
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:44.963
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1082
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.529
Right this way.

1083
00:49:47.616 --> 00:49:49.398
See you later.

1084
00:49:57.224 --> 00:50:00.485
For the record. I think
this is a terrible idea.

1085
00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:02.703
Good to see you too. Dad.

1086
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:06.355
Thanks for coming.

1087
00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:08.572
Always. little cub.

1088
00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:09.746
Hey. gang.
- Hey. Mr. Wolf.

1089
00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:11.442
- Hey. Mr. Wolf.
- What's up?

1090
00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:12.920
Let's see if we can
find your friend.

1091
00:50:15.311 --> 00:50:16.616
Anybody hungry?

1092
00:50:16.703 --> 00:50:18.268
Dude. you just had.
like. nine hot dogs.

1093
00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:20.224
Dachshunds are small.
right. Frankie?

1094
00:50:20.311 --> 00:50:21.920
B-R-B.

1095
00:50:22.007 --> 00:50:23.050
No. you're going
to get us caught.

1096
00:50:23.137 --> 00:50:24.268
Heath.

1097
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:26.659
Heath. Heath.

1098
00:50:26.746 --> 00:50:29.224
It feels like ages since
I've hung out in your work van.

1099
00:50:29.311 --> 00:50:30.703
It has been.

1100
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:32.789
And the rules haven't changed.

1101
00:50:32.876 --> 00:50:35.963
both:
No eating over the keyboard.

1102
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.920
OK. Coleman Eves is one
of our bigger clients.

1103
00:50:42.007 --> 00:50:44.529
A little mysterious.
but they pay well.

1104
00:50:44.616 --> 00:50:46.485
It's a crazy good
security system.

1105
00:50:46.572 --> 00:50:48.485
- Can you get us past it?
- I hope so.

1106
00:50:48.572 --> 00:50:51.572
I helped build it.

1107
00:50:51.659 --> 00:50:53.920
Since Draculaura
has no pulse.

1108
00:50:54.007 --> 00:50:56.007
it should be easy
to spot her

1109
00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:58.833
using biometric
security filters.

1110
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.789
All these years.
I've never actually

1111
00:51:00.876 --> 00:51:03.094
hunted someone using my tech.

1112
00:51:03.181 --> 00:51:05.311
It's like we're on
a secret mission.

1113
00:51:05.398 --> 00:51:09.050
and I'm the guy. the tech guy.

1114
00:51:09.137 --> 00:51:10.616
I've always wanted
to be the guy.

1115
00:51:10.702 --> 00:51:12.702
I know.
Dad. can we...

1116
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:15.789
Oh. Right.
Sorry. OK.

1117
00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:18.659
Wait.
Look at this.

1118
00:51:18.746 --> 00:51:20.920
Bingo.
- Yes.

1119
00:51:22.485 --> 00:51:24.442
OK. let's see where she went.

1120
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.224
- Cleo. hey. What's up?
<i>- Things are a disaster.</i>

1121
00:51:32.311 --> 00:51:33.920
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

1122
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:36.616
Abby and I had to hand out
the cookies. which completely

1123
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:38.050
backfired because
it made you look like

1124
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.658
an out-of-touch elitist.
Meanwhile--

1125
00:51:40.746 --> 00:51:43.658
Hey. how do witches
bake their cookies?

1126
00:51:43.746 --> 00:51:46.007
In a coven.

1127
00:51:46.094 --> 00:51:47.529
We are literally
feeding her material

1128
00:51:47.616 --> 00:51:49.311
to use against us.

1129
00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:50.789
I'm sorry.

1130
00:51:50.876 --> 00:51:52.398
I just need you to cover
for me a little longer.

1131
00:51:52.485 --> 00:51:54.224
How?
I need you here.

1132
00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:57.920
Oh. also. not-real Draculaura
isn't helping.

1133
00:51:58.007 --> 00:52:00.398
Draculaura.
how are you feeling?

1134
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:07.658
My.
She is ill.

1135
00:52:07.746 --> 00:52:09.616
Look. I'm trying. Cleo.

1136
00:52:09.702 --> 00:52:11.268
<i>Try harder.</i>

1137
00:52:11.355 --> 00:52:13.833
<i>Find Draculaura.
and bring her home now.</i>

1138
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.181
<i>And let's win this.</i>

1139
00:52:15.268 --> 00:52:16.876
I will.

1140
00:52:19.702 --> 00:52:22.572
Hey.
You all right?

1141
00:52:22.658 --> 00:52:25.876
It's just...

1142
00:52:25.963 --> 00:52:28.658
there's a lot going on.

1143
00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:31.007
You sound just like your mom.

1144
00:52:31.094 --> 00:52:32.658
She always had a lot going on.

1145
00:52:32.746 --> 00:52:34.789
How did she do it?

1146
00:52:34.876 --> 00:52:37.094
I mean. she was a hero.

1147
00:52:37.181 --> 00:52:39.920
She won prefect.
Everyone loved her.

1148
00:52:40.007 --> 00:52:42.789
- What's so funny?

1149
00:52:42.876 --> 00:52:44.963
Your mom was a lot of things.

1150
00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.050
but well-liked by everyone
was not one of them.

1151
00:52:47.137 --> 00:52:48.789
No.

1152
00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:52.050
She did what she thought was
right. even when it was hard.

1153
00:52:52.137 --> 00:52:56.571
That doesn't always
make you popular.

1154
00:52:56.658 --> 00:52:59.442
OK. are you ready
for some good news?

1155
00:52:59.529 --> 00:53:01.746
Please.

1156
00:53:01.833 --> 00:53:03.485
I think I found her.

1157
00:53:05.442 --> 00:53:07.050
Mmm.

1158
00:53:07.137 --> 00:53:09.442
That's. like.
his 15th hot dog.

1159
00:53:09.529 --> 00:53:11.181
He's a beast.
- Yeah.

1160
00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:13.702
He's. like.
the ultimate monster.

1161
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:15.485
You both are. actually.

1162
00:53:15.571 --> 00:53:18.224
Oh. I'm ultimate. all right.

1163
00:53:18.311 --> 00:53:21.181
except the only way
I can coexist with non-gorgons

1164
00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:24.615
is if I keep my snakes and eyes
covered every minute.

1165
00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:26.398
So I guess I'm too ultimate.

1166
00:53:32.746 --> 00:53:35.355
When Comos happened.

1167
00:53:35.442 --> 00:53:38.746
I felt like
the opposite of ultimate.

1168
00:53:38.833 --> 00:53:40.050
I couldn't help my friends.

1169
00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:43.355
I didn't have any
real monster powers.

1170
00:53:43.442 --> 00:53:45.658
Now I do.

1171
00:53:45.746 --> 00:53:49.746
and I still can't seem to help.

1172
00:53:49.833 --> 00:53:51.615
Are you kidding me?

1173
00:53:51.702 --> 00:53:53.876
Do you have a mirror?

1174
00:53:53.963 --> 00:53:56.224
Frankie. all you do is help
all the time. OK?

1175
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:57.963
You always show up
with your whole heart.

1176
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.181
And you do right
by the people you love.

1177
00:54:01.268 --> 00:54:03.094
Forget upgrades.

1178
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:05.398
You've always had
a monster superpower.

1179
00:54:05.485 --> 00:54:07.311
Hey. an amazing one:

1180
00:54:07.398 --> 00:54:10.268
friendship.

1181
00:54:10.355 --> 00:54:12.876
Thanks. Deuce.

1182
00:54:15.224 --> 00:54:18.485
Yo. these humans got
the food thing down.

1183
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:21.268
Awesome.

1184
00:54:21.355 --> 00:54:23.094
OK.

1185
00:54:23.181 --> 00:54:25.268
Dad found her.
We're going in.

1186
00:54:25.355 --> 00:54:26.920
- Sweet.
- Oh.

1187
00:54:27.007 --> 00:54:29.094
Uh. sorry. Heath.
You're staying here.

1188
00:54:29.181 --> 00:54:30.224
What?

1189
00:54:30.311 --> 00:54:32.050
I can't disable
the fire alarm.

1190
00:54:32.137 --> 00:54:35.050
That is less than sweet.

1191
00:54:35.137 --> 00:54:37.571
<i>Go now.
You're clear.</i>

1192
00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:41.746
We're in.

1193
00:54:44.007 --> 00:54:45.484
Just the right amount
of oomph.

1194
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:47.615
<i>OK. good.</i>

1195
00:54:47.702 --> 00:54:49.702
Cameras are looped. but they'll
auto reset in 10 minutes.

1196
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:51.746
Be quick.
<i>- Thanks. Dad.</i>

1197
00:54:54.355 --> 00:54:56.398
Wow.

1198
00:54:56.484 --> 00:54:58.224
I'm a little nervous.

1199
00:54:58.311 --> 00:54:59.224
Are you nervous?

1200
00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.789
- Dad. which way?
<i>- Left.</i>

1201
00:55:08.876 --> 00:55:11.050
And then your first right.

1202
00:55:11.137 --> 00:55:13.094
<i>She's in the East wing.
room 208.</i>

1203
00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:15.355
OK.

1204
00:55:15.441 --> 00:55:17.571
Go.
I'll guard our escape.

1205
00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:27.746
This company is huge.

1206
00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:30.398
Coleman Eves' products
are sold around the world.

1207
00:55:30.484 --> 00:55:33.181
Their botanical formulations
are valued at half $1 billion.

1208
00:55:33.268 --> 00:55:34.398
and no one even knows
what's in them.

1209
00:55:34.484 --> 00:55:37.094
- Wait.

1210
00:55:40.833 --> 00:55:41.963
Boss is really on a roll.

1211
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:43.833
- Quick. hide.

1212
00:55:45.571 --> 00:55:47.876
This is going to be
quite the party.

1213
00:55:47.963 --> 00:55:50.746
Yeah.

1214
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.441
Big day.
Big. big day.

1215
00:55:55.528 --> 00:55:57.050
"On her birthday.

1216
00:55:57.137 --> 00:55:59.920
she will finally become
the voice of lasting peace"?

1217
00:56:00.007 --> 00:56:03.571
Can Draculaura
really end the war?

1218
00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:05.484
Draculaura?

1219
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.311
Clawdeen?

1220
00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:09.050
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

1221
00:56:09.137 --> 00:56:10.397
Didn't you get my note?

1222
00:56:10.484 --> 00:56:11.702
I did.
but you have to come back

1223
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:13.528
to campus. like. right now.

1224
00:56:13.615 --> 00:56:15.528
Your dad's coming for
your birthday tomorrow.

1225
00:56:15.615 --> 00:56:18.397
- He is?
- Yeah.

1226
00:56:18.484 --> 00:56:20.268
I can't.

1227
00:56:20.355 --> 00:56:21.484
What?

1228
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:25.137
I'm speaking at
the Witch Conclave.

1229
00:56:25.224 --> 00:56:27.658
I don't think
you're hearing me. OK?

1230
00:56:27.746 --> 00:56:29.311
Your dad is going to lose it.

1231
00:56:29.397 --> 00:56:31.658
Bloodgood is going
to have to expel you.

1232
00:56:31.746 --> 00:56:33.484
This all ends badly.

1233
00:56:33.571 --> 00:56:35.181
I've got a chance to make
the world a better place

1234
00:56:35.268 --> 00:56:37.528
for all witches and vampires.

1235
00:56:37.615 --> 00:56:40.702
I can help everyone.

1236
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:43.050
Isn't that what you've
always talked about?

1237
00:56:45.658 --> 00:56:49.441
Yeah. but...

1238
00:56:49.528 --> 00:56:52.137
in every story
I've dreamed about my life.

1239
00:56:52.224 --> 00:56:56.397

Keep this with you this time.

1311
01:00:18.354 --> 01:00:19.789
Good luck with prefect.

1312
01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:25.007
Call me when you win.

1313
01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:50.920
<i>Good afternoon. monsters.</i>

1314
01:00:51.007 --> 01:00:53.963
<i>Who is most worthy
to lead Monster High?</i>

1315
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:57.007
<i>Final prefect speeches
are about to begin.</i>

1316
01:00:57.093 --> 01:01:00.223
<i>Don't be late.
I mean it.</i>

1317
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.658
<i>all: Hey-hey. ho-ho.
every witch has got to go.</i>

1318
01:01:33.746 --> 01:01:37.528
Hey-hey. ho-ho.
every witch has got to go.

1319
01:01:37.615 --> 01:01:39.658
Hey-hey. ho-ho...

1320
01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:42.702
Oh. my Ra.
Listen to them. Clawdeen.

1321
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:44.920
You have to tell them
what they want to hear.

1322
01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:47.746
or else they will
eat you alive.

1323
01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:49.049
Sorry.

1324
01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:51.267
That--that was
a little scary sounding.

1325
01:01:51.354 --> 01:01:53.571
Pep talks are new for me.

1326
01:01:53.658 --> 01:01:55.833
But seriously.
they will eat you alive.

1327
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.746
all: Ho-ho.
every witch has got to go.

1328
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.354
Thank you. fellow monsters.

1329
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:06.310
Toralei Stipe.

1330
01:02:06.397 --> 01:02:08.310
Thank you. Toralei.

1331
01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:11.397
Now. please welcome
our second prefect candidate.

1332
01:02:11.484 --> 01:02:13.267
Clawdeen Wolf.

1333
01:02:20.876 --> 01:02:22.658
Go. Clawdeen.

1334
01:02:27.006 --> 01:02:31.223
Witches are the enemy.

1335
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.136
Witches are evil.

1336
01:02:34.223 --> 01:02:36.397
The only good witch is
a dead witch. right?

1337
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:43.093
Humans said that
about witches too.

1338
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.963
They feared and hunted them.

1339
01:02:46.049 --> 01:02:49.963
just like they feared
and hunted monsters.

1340
01:02:50.049 --> 01:02:53.310
If anyone understands
what it is like to be hated.

1341
01:02:53.397 --> 01:02:56.571
to be persecuted. it's us.

1342
01:02:56.658 --> 01:02:59.702
That's why we need to stand
against ignorance.

1343
01:02:59.789 --> 01:03:02.789
against fear and stand up
for the marginalized

1344
01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:07.484
and misunderstood.

1345
01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:10.962
My best friend
practices witchcraft.

1346
01:03:11.049 --> 01:03:13.049
and I'm proud of her.

1347
01:03:13.136 --> 01:03:16.615
She is one of us.
and she is good.

1348
01:03:16.702 --> 01:03:19.484
So I'm standing up for her
and for anyone.

1349
01:03:19.571 --> 01:03:21.615
monster. human. witch.

1350
01:03:21.702 --> 01:03:23.833
who believes that
ancient prejudices

1351
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.962
are less important
than who we are now.

1352
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:29.223
Who's with me?

1353
01:03:39.702 --> 01:03:43.093
<i>My best friend
practices witchcraft.</i>

1354
01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.484
<i>and I'm proud of her.</i>

1355
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:45.702
Come in.

1356
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.006
<i>She is one of us...</i>

1357
01:03:47.093 --> 01:03:48.397
Hey.

1358
01:03:50.746 --> 01:03:53.223
I got your text.
What's up?

1359
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.136
Listen. I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1360
01:03:55.223 --> 01:03:56.962
I believe in peace.
I do.

1361
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:59.310
But right now. I have
to get back to school.

1362
01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:02.093
But why?

1363
01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.833
My friends. they need me.

1364
01:04:03.919 --> 01:04:07.136
And I need them.

1365
01:04:07.223 --> 01:04:10.962
I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

1366
01:04:11.049 --> 01:04:13.093
I'll come right back.

1367
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.180
We can still speak
to the conclave.

1368
01:04:15.267 --> 01:04:17.354
It's funny.

1369
01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:18.919
As smart as you are.
you still think

1370
01:04:19.006 --> 01:04:20.876
you're a guest here.
when actually.

1371
01:04:20.962 --> 01:04:23.397
you've been a prisoner
all along.

1372
01:04:25.919 --> 01:04:27.354
You.

1373
01:04:27.441 --> 01:04:30.441
Our original idea was to
just kidnap you outright.

1374
01:04:30.528 --> 01:04:32.919
Ellis was just there
to open the portal.

1375
01:04:33.006 --> 01:04:35.136
But when your friends
got in the way.

1376
01:04:35.223 --> 01:04:37.441
well. we had to improvise.

1377
01:04:37.528 --> 01:04:41.006
So it was all a lie.

1378
01:04:41.093 --> 01:04:44.136
It was a means to an end.

1379
01:04:44.223 --> 01:04:46.310
Take her.

1380
01:04:46.397 --> 01:04:49.093
I have very special
plans for you.

1381
01:04:56.484 --> 01:04:58.528
<i>Thank you. students.
A reminder--</i>

1382
01:04:58.615 --> 01:05:01.746
What's your game. Wolf?

1383
01:05:01.833 --> 01:05:03.833
- Sorry?
- You're up to something.

1384
01:05:03.919 --> 01:05:05.875
What's your angle?
- No angle.

1385
01:05:05.962 --> 01:05:08.310
I just finally found my truth.

1386
01:05:08.397 --> 01:05:09.746
- Mm.
- Congratulations.

1387
01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:11.049
You win.

1388
01:05:19.136 --> 01:05:20.484
What is it?

1389
01:05:20.571 --> 01:05:22.615
Something's wrong?

1390
01:05:22.702 --> 01:05:25.571
Bastet is still at the coven.

1391
01:05:25.658 --> 01:05:27.484
She's sending a warning.

1392
01:05:27.571 --> 01:05:29.180
Coven?

1393
01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:31.093
- It's Draculaura.
- What's going on?

1394
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.006
- Our friend is in trouble.
- With witches.

1395
01:05:33.093 --> 01:05:34.962
Wait. I overheard them explaining

1396
01:05:35.049 --> 01:05:38.615
how Draculaura will be...

1397
01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.702
- Come again?
- It's French.

1398
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:42.746
"The voice of eternal peace."
- Yes. Yes.

1399
01:05:42.832 --> 01:05:44.267
But there's another
translation:

1400
01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:46.615
"the voice of eternal rest."

1401
01:05:46.702 --> 01:05:48.223
The mortality curse.

1402
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.962
Wait. the spell that started
the vampire-witch war?

1403
01:05:50.049 --> 01:05:53.180
The story says
a vampire cast it.

1404
01:05:53.267 --> 01:05:56.006
It was too powerful.
It ended eternal life.

1405
01:05:56.093 --> 01:05:58.441
But it's just
a legend. right?

1406
01:05:58.528 --> 01:06:02.006
How could a spell that
powerful exist and no one know?

1407
01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:04.093
There were rumors
back in France

1408
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.528
that witches
were searching for it.

1409
01:06:08.615 --> 01:06:10.223
The mortality curse is real.

1410
01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.571
And they figured out
a way to cast it again...

1411
01:06:12.658 --> 01:06:14.136
Using Draculaura.

1412
01:06:14.223 --> 01:06:16.049
"The voice of eternal peace."

1413
01:06:16.136 --> 01:06:20.267
This was their plan all along--
to kill all vampires.

1414
01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:22.310
They said it would happen
on her birthday...

1415
01:06:22.397 --> 01:06:26.136
When she comes of age
at midnight tonight.

1416
01:06:26.223 --> 01:06:28.571
I told you. Wolf.

1417
01:06:40.441 --> 01:06:42.615
Let go of me.

1418
01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:47.702
What is this place?

1419
01:06:47.788 --> 01:06:50.875
The heart of Coleman Eves.

1420
01:06:50.962 --> 01:06:53.136
Oh. she was just
a tiny seedling

1421
01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:56.702
when she was pulled from
the very soil of hate itself.

1422
01:06:56.788 --> 01:07:01.528
Salem. Massachusetts 1693.

1423
01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:05.397
- 19 witches died at Salem.
- Yes.

1424
01:07:05.484 --> 01:07:09.006
Their lives were ended by
fear and ignorance. by hate.

1425
01:07:09.093 --> 01:07:11.397
Zamara. listen to me--

1426
01:07:12.919 --> 01:07:14.919
Wraith silver.

1427
01:07:15.006 --> 01:07:17.180
Isn't it clever how
it only hurts monsters?

1428
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.962
Why are you doing this?

1429
01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:20.615
I'm sure daddy told you
that old story

1430
01:07:20.702 --> 01:07:22.441
about the mortality curse?

1431
01:07:22.528 --> 01:07:25.049
Turns out it's real.

1432
01:07:25.136 --> 01:07:27.354
And tonight.
you get to cast it.

1433
01:07:27.441 --> 01:07:29.136
What?

1434
01:07:29.223 --> 01:07:31.310
You'll kill us all--
my father. my family.

1435
01:07:31.397 --> 01:07:32.658
Now you get it.

1436
01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:35.223
You see?
I wasn't lying.

1437
01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:37.832
I do want peace.

1438
01:07:37.919 --> 01:07:39.310
But what better way
to achieve it

1439
01:07:39.397 --> 01:07:42.267
than by destroying your enemies
once and for all?

1440
01:07:42.354 --> 01:07:45.180
Mom. we were just going
to blackmail Dracula.

1441
01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:47.441
This-- this was not
part of our plan.

1442
01:07:47.528 --> 01:07:52.658
This was always
part of my plan!

1443
01:07:52.745 --> 01:07:54.354
Sorry.

1444
01:07:59.267 --> 01:08:01.223
Dad. what's happening?

1445
01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.571
Have you found her?
<i>- Yes. and it's not good.</i>

1446
01:08:03.658 --> 01:08:06.354
They've got her in
a subbasement lab of some kind.

1447
01:08:06.441 --> 01:08:08.657
Sweetie. they've got a cage.

1448
01:08:08.745 --> 01:08:10.528
We have to call the police.

1449
01:08:10.615 --> 01:08:12.223
And say what?
Hi.

1450
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:13.962
You know those nice folks who
make your smoothie powder?

1451
01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:15.875
They're actually witches
holding a vampire

1452
01:08:15.962 --> 01:08:17.919
in their creepy
basement layer.

1453
01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:20.049
Dad. we need you.
You're the guy.

1454
01:08:22.528 --> 01:08:23.875
<i>OK. I'm the guy.</i>

1455
01:08:23.962 --> 01:08:26.745
I get it.
I'll be ready.

1456
01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:28.484
Thanks.

1457
01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:31.136
I'm coming with you.

1458
01:08:31.223 --> 01:08:33.441
Draculaura's one of us.
and I can help.

1459
01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:34.962
I know a thing or two
about fighting witches.

1460
01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:38.745
Plus. I have a score to settle.

1461
01:08:38.832 --> 01:08:42.093
That could come in handy.
Come on.

1462
01:09:11.006 --> 01:09:13.223
Move it. stud.
I can't drive stick.

1463
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.093
Right.

1464
01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.528
We've been watching you
a long time. Draculaura.

1465
01:09:18.614 --> 01:09:20.441
nurturing your passions.

1466
01:09:20.528 --> 01:09:22.441
Did you think it was an
accident that you found

1467
01:09:22.528 --> 01:09:24.006
that spell book as a child?

1468
01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:27.180
It was all for this moment.

1469
01:09:27.267 --> 01:09:29.614
The mortality curse can
only be cast by a vampire

1470
01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:31.528
who's come of age.

1471
01:09:31.614 --> 01:09:34.354
I told you you would
learn your true power.

1472
01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:38.136
Happy birthday. by the way.
- Please.

1473
01:09:38.223 --> 01:09:40.049
If you do this.
this war will never end.

1474
01:09:40.136 --> 01:09:42.006
All monsters will come for you.

1475
01:09:42.093 --> 01:09:44.136
It won't just be
vampires anymore.

1476
01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:45.919
Ellis. tell her.
- Mom. please.

1477
01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:48.006
Ellis. one day.
you'll understand.

1478
01:09:48.093 --> 01:09:51.093
No. you do understand. Ellis.
right now. today.

1479
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.006
So aspirational.
and at such a bleak time.

1480
01:09:55.093 --> 01:09:56.049
Brava.

1481
01:09:58.484 --> 01:10:00.657
And goodbye.

1482
01:10:00.745 --> 01:10:03.701
And now it's time
a second spell.

1483
01:10:03.788 --> 01:10:06.919
And I control
your mind as well.

1484
01:10:17.441 --> 01:10:18.745
Minutes away.

1485
01:10:18.832 --> 01:10:22.397
Tick tock.
Tick tock.

1486
01:10:33.267 --> 01:10:34.832
They never learn.

1487
01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:37.354
OK. everyone got the plan?

1488
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:39.267
Yeah. we're going down.

1489
01:10:39.354 --> 01:10:42.006
You're going down.
You're going way down.

1490
01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:49.527
<i>The lab is to your right.</i>

1491
01:10:49.614 --> 01:10:52.049
<i>And I'm turning all cameras
back to live in 30 seconds.</i>

1492
01:10:52.136 --> 01:10:55.484
<i>Be ready.</i>
- Thanks. Dad.

1493
01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:58.441
OK. You heard the man.

1494
01:10:58.527 --> 01:11:01.006
Have fun.
- Oh. we will.

1495
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:06.701
Ready to make some mischief?

1496
01:11:06.788 --> 01:11:10.310
Absolutely.

1497
01:11:10.397 --> 01:11:13.657
I say we start small.

1498
01:11:13.745 --> 01:11:15.919
Build.

1499
01:11:25.962 --> 01:11:28.397
There's someone in G. Smoke.

1500
01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:32.136
Pull it up.

1501
01:11:32.223 --> 01:11:33.701
<i>It's a little smoky
down here.</i>

1502
01:11:33.788 --> 01:11:35.006
<i>You want to send someone?</i>

1503
01:11:35.093 --> 01:11:36.310
<i>Yeah.
I can feel it on my eyes.</i>

1504
01:11:36.397 --> 01:11:38.483
<i>Yeah. Something's
happening down here.</i>

1505
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.527
Let's go.

1506
01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:46.919
OK.

1507
01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:48.440
The smart move
is to come quietly.

1508
01:11:48.527 --> 01:11:50.223
but you two don't look
that smart.

1509
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.136
Guilty.

1510
01:12:02.745 --> 01:12:05.527
I guess a gorgon's not much
without his killer eyes.

1511
01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:07.397
Clearly.
you don't know gorgons.

1512
01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.745
Coffin thumbs.

1513
01:12:23.397 --> 01:12:25.310
<i>Draculaura.
I'm here at your school.</i>

1514
01:12:25.397 --> 01:12:27.267
<i>Where are you?</i>

1515
01:12:27.354 --> 01:12:29.354
<i>Zamara.</i>

1516
01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.657
Hi. Dracula.

1517
01:12:30.745 --> 01:12:32.788
<i>- Where is my daughter?</i>
- Oh. she's fine.

1518
01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:35.788
She's comfortable
for the moment.

1519
01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:37.832
<i>What have you done?</i>

1520
01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:39.093
<i>If you hurt her. I swear--</i>

1521
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.180
Shh. shh. shh.
no time for empty threats.

1522
01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:43.354
You only have
a few minutes left.

1523
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.267
You see. she's casting
the mortality curse--

1524
01:12:45.354 --> 01:12:46.657
<i>No.</i>

1525
01:12:46.745 --> 01:12:49.093
- Which in seven minutes...
<i>- Zamara.</i>

1526
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.267
Will end you
and all your kind forever.

1527
01:12:51.354 --> 01:12:53.788
<i>No. no. You don't have
to do this. Zamara.</i>

1528
01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:55.180
I just wanted
to see your face

1529
01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:56.788
when you and your daughter
suddenly age

1530
01:12:56.875 --> 01:12:58.570
and turn to dust.
<i>- No!</i>

1531
01:12:58.657 --> 01:13:01.310
- We have a situation.
<i>- No. Talk to me.</i>

1532
01:13:01.396 --> 01:13:03.483
<i>- Help me!
- She's been bitten!</i>

1533
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:06.919
<i>- Get her out of here.</i>

1534
01:13:07.006 --> 01:13:10.136
I will handle this myself.

1535
01:13:10.223 --> 01:13:11.962
<i>- Listen to me.</i>
- Goodbye. Dracula.

1536
01:13:12.049 --> 01:13:14.180
<i>Zamara. Zamara. Zamara!</i>

1537
01:13:25.353 --> 01:13:28.788
Make sure she keeps chanting.

1538
01:13:35.049 --> 01:13:37.093
Stay here.
No one gets in.

1539
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.657
- Understood.
- No one.

1540
01:13:40.745 --> 01:13:42.788
She seems tense.

1541
01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:43.875
Cheers.

1542
01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.353
You're going to regret that.

1543
01:13:51.049 --> 01:13:53.483
Yeah. I'm not feeling regret.
More of a thrill. actually.

1544
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:54.962
See ya.

1545
01:13:58.527 --> 01:14:00.832
Come on.

1546
01:14:00.919 --> 01:14:02.309
No.

1547
01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.440
11:57.
We're out of time.

1548
01:14:12.223 --> 01:14:15.962
Frankie. I can't do it.

1549
01:14:16.049 --> 01:14:17.570
Come on!

1550
01:14:17.657 --> 01:14:19.223
Open!

1551
01:14:19.309 --> 01:14:20.875
Parametric blocks are
coded to unique users.

1552
01:14:20.962 --> 01:14:23.049
You know that.

1553
01:14:23.136 --> 01:14:25.223
- There has to be a way.
- Think.

1554
01:14:25.309 --> 01:14:28.483
Locks. How do you break
an unbreakable lock?

1555
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:29.657
I've got it.

1556
01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:31.006
Two of my favorite books.

1557
01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:33.614
What?
What are you doing?

1558
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:36.745
Advanced Electrical Theory
and Applied Monster Physics.

1559
01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:39.745
Get down.

1560
01:14:57.266 --> 01:14:59.701
Stop.
Please stop.

1561
01:14:59.788 --> 01:15:01.483
We are just trying
to save our friend.

1562
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:02.745
Ellis. please.

1563
01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.180
Sorry.

1564
01:15:07.701 --> 01:15:10.049
Well done. Ellis.

1565
01:15:10.136 --> 01:15:13.483
And you two. I am impressed.

1566
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:14.832
I really am.

1567
01:15:14.919 --> 01:15:16.527
It's a very delicate spell.

1568
01:15:16.614 --> 01:15:18.266
The slightest touch
would have woken her.

1569
01:15:18.353 --> 01:15:20.136
You almost succeeded.

1570
01:15:20.223 --> 01:15:25.788
But now. children.
the fun is over.

1571
01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:29.614
It's time for you to die--

1572
01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:36.396
Hurry.
I can't hold her.

1573
01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.527
Wraith silver.
- You can't touch it.

1574
01:15:43.614 --> 01:15:45.440
It'll destroy you.

1575
01:15:45.527 --> 01:15:48.919
Draculaura. please wake up!

1576
01:15:54.093 --> 01:15:55.657
We're out of time.

1577
01:15:55.745 --> 01:15:56.614
No.
No.

1578
01:15:56.701 --> 01:15:59.049
No! No!

1579
01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:01.527
Clawdeen.
No. Clawdeen!

1580
01:16:01.614 --> 01:16:03.353
Stop. please.

1581
01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.396
There's got to be another way.

1582
01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:08.962
I can't hold her.
She's too strong.

1583
01:16:12.006 --> 01:16:14.788
No!

1584
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.049
No!

1585
01:16:33.396 --> 01:16:35.788
Clawdeen?

1586
01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:38.309
Clawdeen.

1587
01:16:38.396 --> 01:16:41.701
Clawdeen. wake up.

1588
01:16:41.788 --> 01:16:44.222
Clawdeen.

1589
01:16:44.309 --> 01:16:45.788
Clawdeen. don't leave me.

1590
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.135
<i>Draculaura.
I think she's dying.</i>

1591
01:17:02.527 --> 01:17:04.179
This is so good.

1592
01:17:04.266 --> 01:17:06.006
I can't handle it.

1593
01:17:12.049 --> 01:17:13.832
Literally. like.
two whole days.

1594
01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:24.396
I am the reaper.
I've come for you.

1595
01:17:24.483 --> 01:17:27.093
Please.
I'm not ready.

1596
01:17:27.179 --> 01:17:28.440
<i>- Clawdeen.</i>
- Frankie?

1597
01:17:28.527 --> 01:17:30.222
<i>Clawdeen. wake up.</i>

1598
01:17:30.309 --> 01:17:32.919
- Frankie!
- The dead must rest.

1599
01:17:33.006 --> 01:17:35.527
Surrender. Clawdeen Wolf.

1600
01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:39.614
Surrender?

1601
01:17:39.701 --> 01:17:41.657
Surrender?

1602
01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:44.309
That means...

1603
01:17:47.614 --> 01:17:49.657
That I have a choice.

1604
01:17:49.745 --> 01:17:52.832
<i>- Clawdeen.</i>
- Frankie. I'm here.

1605
01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:54.614
<i>Clawdeen. don't leave me.
Don't leave me.</i>

1606
01:17:54.701 --> 01:17:56.483
<i>Wake up.
Please wake up.</i>

1607
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.006
<i>Please wake up.</i>

1608
01:18:57.353 --> 01:19:01.309
Clawdeen?

1609
01:19:01.396 --> 01:19:04.005
Hey.

1610
01:19:04.092 --> 01:19:05.527
Hey.

1611
01:19:05.614 --> 01:19:07.353
Deuce. she's awake.

1612
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.527
Hey. you.
You OK?

1613
01:19:09.614 --> 01:19:12.440
Still in one piece.

1614
01:19:12.527 --> 01:19:14.527
Oh. man.

1615
01:19:14.614 --> 01:19:16.353
More or less.

1616
01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.396
Let's get you up.

1617
01:19:17.483 --> 01:19:18.962
Yeah.
Come on.

1618
01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.832
- You good?
- Yeah.

1619
01:19:23.919 --> 01:19:25.309
What happened?

1620
01:19:25.396 --> 01:19:27.222
It was all Draculaura.

1621
01:19:27.309 --> 01:19:30.701
When you woke her.
it was unbelievable.

1622
01:19:30.788 --> 01:19:32.875
Yeah. she opened up a major
can of witch butt whooping

1623
01:19:32.962 --> 01:19:34.701
on everyone.

1624
01:19:34.788 --> 01:19:37.745
It was fantastic. witchcraft
used by the good guys.

1625
01:19:37.832 --> 01:19:40.875
Apology accepted. Tor.

1626
01:19:49.092 --> 01:19:52.266
both: I'm sorry.

1627
01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:54.135
- Jinx.

1628
01:19:56.222 --> 01:19:59.309
Draculaura!

1629
01:19:59.396 --> 01:20:00.832
Duty calls.

1630
01:20:00.919 --> 01:20:02.309
What did she do to you?

1631
01:20:02.396 --> 01:20:03.788
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?

1632
01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:07.614
Dad. I'm OK.
Everything's OK.

1633
01:20:07.701 --> 01:20:09.353
And I've got a few
high-profile prisoners

1634
01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.135
for you to deal with.

1635
01:20:11.222 --> 01:20:13.048
Oh. I will.

1636
01:20:13.135 --> 01:20:16.266
I most certainly will.

1637
01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:20.179
My little ghoul
is growing up...

1638
01:20:20.266 --> 01:20:22.179
so quickly.

1639
01:20:24.745 --> 01:20:26.918
Zamara.
- Hello. Dracula.

1640
01:20:27.005 --> 01:20:28.527
Still with the cape?
- Hey.

1641
01:20:28.614 --> 01:20:30.832
It's a cloth.
Superheroes wear capes.

1642
01:20:30.918 --> 01:20:33.135
Uh. I'm sorry.

1643
01:20:33.222 --> 01:20:36.440
I had no idea.

1644
01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:38.614
I know.

1645
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:43.005
But you did the right thing
when it counted.

1646
01:20:43.092 --> 01:20:47.266
Thank you.

1647
01:20:47.353 --> 01:20:50.092
So how about we make this
the beginning

1648
01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.570
of that new era of peace?

1649
01:20:52.657 --> 01:20:54.832
Deal?

1650
01:20:54.918 --> 01:20:57.309
Deal.

1651
01:20:57.396 --> 01:20:59.353
See you around. Ellis.

1652
01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.266
See you around. Draculaura.

1653
01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.701
Nice moves. D.

1654
01:21:05.788 --> 01:21:06.961
Not too shabby.

1655
01:21:07.048 --> 01:21:09.657
OK. tell me exactly
what happened.

1656
01:21:09.745 --> 01:21:11.005
She can summon bats.

1657
01:21:11.092 --> 01:21:13.570
It was fire.

1658
01:21:17.614 --> 01:21:19.483
Nice.

1659
01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.266
I think I finally got my
new upgrades under control.

1660
01:21:21.353 --> 01:21:23.222
I always knew you would.

1661
01:21:23.309 --> 01:21:25.570
Thanks.

1662
01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:29.048
Looks like you got that
party you wanted after all.

1663
01:21:29.135 --> 01:21:31.396

Bloodgood's about to announce
the prefect results.

01:21:55.353 --> 01:21:57.005
I'm OK.

1673
01:22:04.135 --> 01:22:06.005
Come on.
Let's go.

Let's see if I got my wish.

1676
01:22:19.005 --> 01:22:23.005
In our school's grand
tradition of prefecte electio.

1677
01:22:23.092 --> 01:22:24.788
the moment has come.

1678
01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:32.483
This year's
student prefect is...

1679
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.570
Clawdeen Wolf.

1680
01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:47.831
Hey. Kumon.

1681
01:22:49.961 --> 01:22:52.048
You protected your pack.

1682
01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:55.440
even when the school
hated you for it.

1683
01:22:55.527 --> 01:22:57.701
That took guts. prefect.

1684
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:10.353
Looks like you've got
a few scars of your own now.

1685
01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.701
Well. I guess. we finally
have something in common.

1686
01:23:13.787 --> 01:23:16.483
We're werecreatures. Wolf.

1687
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:19.309
We share the moon.

1688
01:23:19.396 --> 01:23:21.701
I guess we do.

1689
01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:22.874
Hm.

1690
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:32.048
Clawdeen. photo op.

1691
01:23:32.135 --> 01:23:33.527
Yeah. just a sec.

1692
01:23:33.614 --> 01:23:35.570
Say shelfie.
both: Shelfie.

1693
01:23:35.657 --> 01:23:37.527
Where's Draculaura?

1694
01:23:37.614 --> 01:23:40.787
Ayo. D. we got
to cut that cake.

1695
01:23:40.874 --> 01:23:43.135
You know. I feel like

1696
01:23:43.222 --> 01:23:45.309
I got to see a little
of the real gorgon out there.

1697
01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:47.831
It was kind of cool.
- I got to be honest.

1698
01:23:47.918 --> 01:23:52.135
For the first time in a while.
it felt like me.

1699
01:23:52.222 --> 01:23:56.483
And I've realized something.

1700
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:59.135
I've realized I need to leave.

1701
01:23:59.222 --> 01:24:00.570
Leave?

1702
01:24:00.657 --> 01:24:03.266
Yeah. the Gorgodian.

1703
01:24:03.353 --> 01:24:06.918
I'm going to do it and go
figure out who I really am.

1704
01:24:07.005 --> 01:24:08.614
What?

1705
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.353
But that's a whole year.

1706
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.570
Yeah. it is.

1707
01:24:13.657 --> 01:24:16.266
But Monster High.

1708
01:24:16.353 --> 01:24:18.222
I can't imagine it without you.

1709
01:24:18.309 --> 01:24:21.179
No. I can't imagine
Monster High without you.

1710
01:24:21.266 --> 01:24:25.005
This is who you are.
You found yourself.

1711
01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:28.700
Now it's my turn.

1712
