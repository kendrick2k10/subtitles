00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:51.125
You know. when they say. uh sun kissed?

4
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.583
They mean you.

5
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.083
Oh. is that so?

6
00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.708
Well. I think they are wrong.

7
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.833
Wrong?

8
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:01.958
I'm Paul-kissed.

9
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.875
Paul-kissed? I like that.
I like that.

10
00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.791
-Sis. guys.
-What do you want. Brian?

11
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.083
Yes. Brian. What do you want?

12
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.291
I want my friend back.

13
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.333
Really? I thought you actually
wanted him to be happy.

14
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.791
So. like all comedians you're gonna
be here until Thursday tight?

15
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.333
If I come back on Thursday.
you’ll be gone?

16
00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:30.958
-Baby.
-Babe.

17
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:35.125
-I think your little brother needs a hug.
-I think so too.

18
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:45.708
Ugh. Brian.

19
00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.250
Thank you. big sis.

20
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.583
Okay. my man. we need to talk. alright.

21
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.166
I want you to listen here.

22
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.750
This whole thing…

23
00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.958
Tom and Jerry with my wife.
has just gotta stop.

24
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.083
Wait. so you’re telling me
you’re going from zero to 100.

25
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.500
Are you saying wife?

26
00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:11.208
Yes. Brian. Wife.

27
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.125
Look around you.
All these balloons. all these things.

28
00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.208
That's why you are here.
We’re getting married.

29
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.500
So you’re marrying her.
You haven’t married her yet.

30
00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:22.250
-So right now she’s your fiancé.
-Okay.

31
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.208
Okay. Fi-an-cé.

32
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.500
Fiancé or whatever you want to call it.

33
00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.041
But whatever it is. I don’t like it.

34
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.125
It's crazy for me to say it.
but it’s like you guys are dating.

35
00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:35.500
Sis. don’t you dare. man.
Me and a slay queen?

36
00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:36.583
Take a look at me.

37
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.333
Listen. man. The slay queens
around here don’t want you.

38
00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:40.333
-Who?
-You.

39
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:43.375
Tell me you’re joking.
You’re joking. you’re full of jokes.

40
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.125
Actually. let me show you…

41
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.875
Listen. Listen.

42
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.208
These are Lesedi's friends. okay?

43
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.791
It’s the second time I’m meeting them.
Please don't mess this up.

44
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.458
You know what?
Move out the way.

45
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.458
Let me show you
that I can get these girls.

46
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:00.833
Whenever I want.

47
00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:01.791
Move. Move.

48
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.833
This is gonna end in tears.

49
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:08.708
-Hey Chief. Relax.
-I just… I just…

50
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:11.416
So. yeah. tomorrow we're looking at cars

51
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.458
and I'm hoping that Red AMG
will be waiting for me.

52
00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:16.541
Are you serious?

53
00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:18.750
You guys okay?

54
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:19.833
Mmm.

55
00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.333
We are having a great time.

56
00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:23.333
Good.

57
00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:24.666
Let's get the gifts inside.

58
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.833
Gifts.

59
00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:27.833
Plural. man?

60
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.041
I thought the only gift here was me.

61
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.708
I mean. I'm gifted.

62
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:33.916
Isn’t that right gents?

63
00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.916
Okay. that's it. I'm leaving now.

64
00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:43.250
Okay. Uh…

65
00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.541
Let's get those presents.

66
00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.791
It's fine. We've got this.

67
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.083
Maybe I should have said.
Brian the Moratata.

68
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.791
No. Brian the Bazooka.

69
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.791
Maybe I should try it on these ladies.

70
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:13.416
Ladies?

71
00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.750
How are you. ladies?

72
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.458
Well. it's time to open my presents.

73
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.750
Yes!

74
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:37.875
Which one shall I open first?

75
00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.333
-The big one.
-Oh.

76
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.750
Ah. Gigi. this one is
obviously from your right?

77
00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:45.375
Yeah. it's from me and hubby

78
00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.791
who like. cheese platters
I don't see around me.

79
00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:53.833
Well. thank you for the sage.
We shall upgrade from now on.

80
00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.041
Which one shall I open next?

81
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.583
I wonder what's inside?

82
00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:07.625
Wow. Brian.

83
00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.125
-Really?
-Come on. dude.

84
00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.125
What?

85
00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:14.750
Apparently for a married couple
it spices things up in their marriage.

86
00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:16.500
-Ah. Brian!
-That's so gross.

87
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.500
Hey. you woman.

88
00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:22.375
I had to buy drinks for a girl
so I could steal that thing.

89
00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:24.666
Sis. man!

90
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.250
-What's wrong. geez?
-Out!

91
00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.625
-Get out. Brian.
-Get out.

92
00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:30.333
Go and be with your dildo.

93
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:32.583
-Go!
-Go. go!

94
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.208
Out you go. Brian.

95
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.333
Okay.

96
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.125
I would like to propose a toast
to Paul and Lesedi.

97
00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.750
May you have a beautiful engagement.

98
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.958
Cheers!

99
00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:01.666
Whoo!

100
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.916
Huh!

101
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.583
What is this?

102
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:21.583
Hello. Daddy's home!

103
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.333
Ah. man!

104
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:35.041
Uh. cops. cops.

105
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:38.125
No man. no man.

106
00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.458
Mommy! Zozo!

107
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.375
-Zozo!
-I'm coming.

108
00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:52.458
-Zozo.
-Yeah?

109
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:54.541
We are robbed and you're
supposed to be on duty.

110
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.000
Robbed?

111
00:07:56.083 --> 00:08:00.208
But the missus took everything in a truck
and she even showed me papers.

112
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.916
What… What papers. Zozo?

113
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.916
Oh.

114
00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.333
Eish sorry. Mr. Sithole.

115
00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:09.750
Ah!

116
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:13.666
-Zozo! Come on. Zozo.
-Mr. Sithole. I'm sorry.

117
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.666
Sorry. boss.

118
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.625
No man. no man.

119
00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:20.333
A whole truck? Come on. man.

120
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.666
Come on!

121
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.208
Wakey!

122
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.125
Wakey!

123
00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.625
Good morning.

124
00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:02.583
Is it six thirty already?

125
00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:04.416
It's a quarter to seven.

126
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.458
And why are the taxis still outside?

127
00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:08.708
Hey.

128
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.208
There we go.

129
00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:16.583
I didn't hear you leave.

130
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:22.375
I started doing my morning yoga again.

131
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.416
Oh. I see you also think
I'm Italian or something.

132
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.416
I mean. what nonsense is this?

133
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.500
Ah man. huh?

134
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:41.375
See. that's what you get for
marrying a traditional man. Gigi.

135
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:42.958
This is not a cultural thing.

136
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:47.875
but humans are not supposed
to chow strawberries and eggs.

137
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:52.916
Twelve years in and we still
have so much work to do with you.

138
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.625
So says someone who's married
to a man who loves mopane worms.

139
00:09:56.708 --> 00:10:00.500
Oh. my God. Are you comparing
my food to my mopane worms?

140
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:01.625
Gigi. darling.

141
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:05.833
Do yoga or something.
Otherwise. I'm gonna show you.

142
00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:07.958
You're crazy.

143
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.666
Downward dog.

144
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.041
You’re very delicious.

145
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.583
Lufa. stop it.

146
00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.125
Oh. my God. don't you dare.

147
00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:24.833
No. I like it.

148
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:26.750
No!

149
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:29.916
Lufa. stop it!

150
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.708
Come here. let me light you up.

151
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.208
Let's go. come here.

152
00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:47.833
Lesedi?

153
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:54.833
How can we help?

154
00:10:54.916 --> 00:10:57.458
No… it’s a false alarm.

155
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:59.625
We came all this way for nothing?

156
00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:03.291
No. no. It's not nothing.
It's… It's something.

157
00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.666
You know. it's nothing.
Because my girlfriend robbed me.

158
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.041
Oh no. that’s your problem then.

159
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:12.791
Let’s go.

160
00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:47.791
Girl. you are a mess.

161
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.125
I don't know why I always
bring home the lazy ones.

162
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.541
This guy.

163
00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:02.833
Dude. Get up. get up. get up.

164
00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:04.000
We have to go.

165
00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.875
What’s going on?

166
00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.166
What’s going on? It’s morning.
That means you have to go.

167
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.958
-Maybe we can chill for a bit.
-Chill for a bit?

168
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.041
No. no. no. no. Who chills on a Tuesday?

169
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:14.958
Actors.

170
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.958
Well… Newsflash.

171
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:19.666
I'm an accountant and I need
to account for my work hours.

172
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.666
What you need to do is… act elsewhere.

173
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.375
-Get it?
-But actors don’t act busy.

174
00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.583
you know we are busy acting.

175
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.750
Okay. since you're busy acting.

176
00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:37.708
How about we get busy and
do a little role-play. Loverboy?

177
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:39.208
Hey. role play?

178
00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.833
Okay. Mama…

179
00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:45.458
When I say action.
you pack up and you leave.

180
00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:46.416
Action!

181
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:49.375
It’s okay.

182
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.916
-I’ll go then.
-Yeah. go.

183
00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:53.708
Naledi!

184
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.208
Naledi. love.

185
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.875
You must look sharp. hey?

186
00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.041
-I'm done.
-Nice.

187
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:01.125
Let's have a look.

188
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:04.208
Oh. that's nice.

189
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:05.708
Breakfast? Chop. chop.

190
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:09.000
-I'll eat in the car.
-Meals on wheels again?

191
00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.291
-Hmm. Okay.
-Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

192
00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.333
Now you look better.

193
00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.541
Oh. well. Okay. let's go.

194
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:25.250
So I've booked you at Night Lights.

195
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:26.583
-What?
-Yeah.

196
00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:28.916
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

197
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.625
Thank you. Peaches.

198
00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:32.750
Are you ever going
to stop calling me that?

199
00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.791
Are your jokes ever
going to start running out?

200
00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:38.791
Jisses. You!

201
00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:47.125
Are you not going to get dressed?

202
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:50.958
Um. no. I thought I
would just chill today.

203
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:51.875
In my house?

204
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:53.875
Come on. Kagiso.

205
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.666
I need to lock up Nthabiseng.

206
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.041
Wow Kagiso. I can’t stay for a bit
before you throw me out?

207
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.500
I’m not throwing you out.

208
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:05.041
I'm just saying there are things
I need to prepare

209
00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:07.791
and I need to leave
within the next hour. that's all.

210
00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:08.916
Whatever.

211
00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.208
Ntabising?

212
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.958
What should I do with this thing?

213
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I have one at home.
so this one can stay here.

214
00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:29.291
-So I must throw it out. is that it?
-Why can't it just stay in the bathroom?

215
00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:31.333
We don't live together.

216
00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:35.250
Its shower gel. Kagiso.
it's not a marriage proposal.

217
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.291
Shower gel!

218
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.291
It's been four years of this.

219
00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.791
And you can't handle
shower gel in your bathroom?

220
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:42.333
You know what.

221
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:45.000
Let me get out of your way.

222
00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.291
Look Nthabiseng. Peach… Peaches.

223
00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:48.416
Peaches.

224
00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:33.583
Hello Ry. Ry.

225
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.375
Hello. hello. hello. hello.

226
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:37.833
Hello. hello. hello.

227
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.875
Hello. Ryistros.

228
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.458
How’s it going. boy?

229
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.708
How's it. Brian.

230
00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:52.333
I'm good… Yoh!

231
00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:54.791
So…

232
00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.916
One. that was mine.

233
00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.708
And two.

234
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:00.833
You made a mess.

235
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:03.375
Yeah. I'm hungry.

236
00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:05.541
I'm hungry. Very hungry.

237
00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:08.500
I can eat a… a lion. Huh?

238
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:11.833
Hungry. hey.

239
00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:16.916
Jisses. man.

240
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.333
My man. what is it?

241
00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:22.708
This is bird seeds?

242
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.708
What do you guys eat in the suburbs?

243
00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:31.958
No way. man.

244
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:41.125
Look. just don't trash the place okay?

245
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:44.250
No man. Gross!

246
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.750
Hold up bra.
Can I just bring some girls here?

247
00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:52.791
Just to put some life in this…
in this house of yours. huh?

248
00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:58.666
You too. my man.

249
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:10.083
I’m going to fill my head up with this.

250
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:15.416
It's going to be filled up.

251
00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.291
Filled up till it’s full.

252
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.083
Old friend. Old friend.

253
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:35.000
Yeah. it's full now.

254
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:36.625
It's full.

255
00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:46.916
-Yeah.
-Okay.

256
00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:48.916
Whatever you want.

257
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.416
Of course. I get everything I need.

258
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.208
Yes. you do.

259
00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:01.208
No. it's loud. baby.

260
00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.125
Lesedi. turn it down. It's loud.

261
00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:09.083
No. Lesedi. turn it down. It's loud.

262
00:18:09.916 --> 00:18:11.625
It's loud. baby.

263
00:18:11.708 --> 00:18:13.375
Turn it down. Lesedi. it's loud.

264
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.416
No. it's loud.

265
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.208
It's too loud. Lesedi.

266
00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:18.583
It's loud…!

267
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:35.458
We're sorry. your call
could not be dialed.

268
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.833
Please check the number and try again.

269
00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:39.708
Okay.

270
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:43.208
Thank you.

271
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:45.958
Thank you.

272
00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.000
-So okay.
-This is real food.

273
00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:53.041
You must have been there a talent
manager in your previous life.

274
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.750
I'm sorry. manager?

275
00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.291
Is that how you see me?

276
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.416
Read my lips.

277
00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:04.125
Previous life.

278
00:20:04.208 --> 00:20:07.666
Well. in my present life.
I'm a lawyer. baby cakes.

279
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.541
-And that's good enough for me.
-Lazo. Lazo.

280
00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.750
Oh. there's my family.

281
00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.416
Family!

282
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.958
Where are you going?

283
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:17.208
Hey. man.

284
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:19.583
-Bye baby girl. Hey. Mvimvi.
-Bye.

285
00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:21.208
-Who’s Mvimvi?
-You.

286
00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.291
Your man has weird names. Mvimvi.

287
00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:26.125
-Hello. sweetie pie. What's up?
-What are you doing here?

288
00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:29.500
I'm here to…

289
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:39.083
So I take it Ryan didn't feed you.

290
00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:40.833
Sis. man.

291
00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:44.750
Ryan. with all that bad food in his house.
he still can't pull chicks.

292
00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:47.291
Uh-huh. dude. I'm hungry.

293
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:51.250
And plus. Paul sent me some cash.
And you know. speaking about Paul.

294
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:54.166
That one's gonna get divorced
before he gets married. Trust me.

295
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.416
-I'm sorry. What?
-He sounds like a sick dog.

296
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.375
I mean. how do you get sick
when you have a woman?

297
00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:04.083
Argh man. you just don't like her.
Man. maybe he's got the flu. okay?

298
00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.041
Mmm-hmm.

299
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:06.916
Um… So um…

300
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.291
-What do you have in the house to eat?
-Me?

301
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:20.666
Hey. hey. hey. Do not touch my thighs.

302
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.541
I would never. I would never.

303
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:27.125
No problem. sir.

304
00:21:28.083 --> 00:21:29.041
Yes.

305
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:31.833
Uh. it will be by you as soon as possible.

306
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:33.666
Okay.

307
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.833
Thanks. sir.

308
00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:38.250
What's up. dude?

309
00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:41.916
Listen. I can't do these right now.
I've actually got a client meeting.

310
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.458
I just got off the phone with him
and I said it's ready.

311
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:46.333
Shouldn't you check with me first?

312
00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:49.208
I did two weeks ago
and you said it will be finished.

313
00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:50.291
Steve.

314
00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:53.500
There's two people who carry
the load in this business. okay?

315
00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:55.708
So it's share and share alike.

316
00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:00.250
Yolisa.

317
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:05.500
It's Yolisa. Not Yo-Lisa.

318
00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.708
Sheesh.

319
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.791
Should I book you guys a room?

320
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:15.583
No man. no need to be jealous.
boss man.

321
00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:17.583
What am I gonna do about this now?

322
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:22.833
Firstly. I would take those files back.
because it is not your job. it's his.

323
00:22:22.916 --> 00:22:24.208
You know what?

324
00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:25.458
You're right.

325
00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:30.750
I hate complainers.

326
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:34.333
All the single people who always
complaining. But I know what he wants.

327
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.875
I know one thing. trust me.

328
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:38.916
Andy?

329
00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:41.500
What's up. Steve?

330
00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:42.833
Yeah. I just want to…

331
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.500
Are you going to come back
after your meeting?

332
00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:48.125
Nope.

333
00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:49.166
Anyway…

334
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:53.875
It's best that you just don't do it.
especially at work.

335
00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:01.250
Brian?

336
00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:02.500
-Honestly.
-What. my man?

337
00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:05.541
My man. I'm a big man with a
big stomach and a big appetite.

338
00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:08.500
-What do you expect?
-You'll eat us out of house and home.

339
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:11.708
You are married. so it's cool.
So hubby will buy supper.

340
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:15.291
-Shush. I'm calling Paul.
-Paulie. my boy. that's my homie.

341
00:23:15.375 --> 00:23:17.333
-He sent me money.
-Shut up.

342
00:23:18.416 --> 00:23:19.500
Hello.

343
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:22.708
Paul? Hi. Hi. my sweet. How are you?

344
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:24.125
-Hey. Gigi.
-Brian…

345
00:23:24.208 --> 00:23:26.333
Brian tells me you're sick?

346
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.833
I'm not sick um…

347
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:33.333
I'm a bit down.

348
00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.125
-What happened?
-I don't know. man.

349
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:40.708
You know. everything was
fine and then she was gone.

350
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:43.333
Oh. my God! Oh no.

351
00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:46.916
Did you guys have um.
did you guys have a fight?

352
00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:49.500
I don't know. man.

353
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:52.541
I came home and the house is empty.

354
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.958
Oh. my God. I'm so sorry. Paul.

355
00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:58.958
Gigi. I… I don't know
what I'm going to do.

No. no. no. no. no. no. Don't do that.

357
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.750
Um… give it time.

-It'll get better. I promise.
-She was everything to me.

359
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:12.500
Ooh. Paulie. Paulie. Paulie boy.
There's so many fish in the sea. my boy.

Part? What part?

You've never killed
an audition in your life.

369
00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:36.708
Oh. for real.

370
00:24:36.791 --> 00:24:39.791
My man. you got to lie and lie

371
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.750
and come up with an honest lie.

372
00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:43.166
Simple.

373
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.041
There is nothing honest about you. Brian.
Just finish the chicken.

374
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.583
Are you sure? Thank you.

375
00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:53.583
There's nothing honest about me?

376
00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:56.541
This guy is full of nonsense.

377
00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:07.416
Knock. knock.

378
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.625
Boo!

00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:14.666
You're so weak all the time. All the time.

381
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:17.583

00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:34.000
Hmm?

389

00:26:02.708 --> 00:26:06.083
The boys took her

Hey. guys?

Hey. you do.

461
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:08.625
-You're just scared of your partner.
-Shut up. Brian.

462
00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:09.625
Guys.

463
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:13.833
Do you remember

464
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:17.625
-Six in the city?
-Yes.

465

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.125
-Steve?
-Stevo?

476
00:29:39.208 --> 00:29:42.750
-Come sit here right now.
-He is so boring. He’s boring.

00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.791
But I told you about this guy.

478
00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:45.833

Hey. no. He is so boring. He’s boring.

480
00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:57.625
Oh! Scary.

00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:02.625
But why me. why?

00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:20.250
Why Lesedi. why?

485
00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:22.458
Eish! Eish!

00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.666
You as well.

487
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.500
Why boss? Huh?

488
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.750
Why are you doing this?

489
00:30:31.916 --> 00:30:35.083
The neighbors have been telling me
you've been crying for days.

490
00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.250
-What's wrong?
-Zozo.

491
00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.875
Eish. I'm crying. Zozo.

492
00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:48.208
I'm crying because of this beauty.

493
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.000
She's not a beauty. this one.
She's a beast.

494
00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.166
I don’t like her.

495
00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.750
Hey. What is that?

496
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:02.333
Hey.

497
00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:06.125
You boss. duty calls.

498
00:31:06.208 --> 00:31:07.541
Jeeze man…

499
00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:10.416
Hey. Zozo?

500
00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:14.125
Your breasts are calling out your name…

501
00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:17.250
Zozo.

502
00:31:25.125 --> 00:31:26.833
I said I'll do it. Gigi.

503
00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:29.666
Stop throwing your make-up
out of the cot. man.

504
00:31:31.916 --> 00:31:32.916
Andy.

505
00:31:34.083 --> 00:31:35.166
What now?

506
00:31:36.208 --> 00:31:39.375
You said that there's two people
in this company

507
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:41.375
and we have to share the load.

508
00:31:41.458 --> 00:31:44.875
So. it's time you balance the scales.

509
00:31:44.958 --> 00:31:48.208
-What on earth are you talking about?
-I'm going to Cape Town tomorrow.

510
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.500
I'm so glad you called.

511
00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:55.083
Oh. baby. I'm glad you came.

512
00:31:55.875 --> 00:31:58.000
-Who said I came?
-What? Huh?

513
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.041
I'm kidding.

514
00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:03.708
Oh. I'm kidding.
I'm just kidding.

515
00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:06.541
Hmm. Wait. you're kidding
or you didn't or…

516
00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.625
Because baby. I mean.
we can always go again.

517
00:32:08.708 --> 00:32:13.500
-You know what I mean?
-No. you have nothing to worry about.

518
00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:15.458
Who said I was weak?

519
00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.041
Listen…

520
00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:22.958
So we're going to Cape Town.

521
00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:24.666
-What?
-Yeah.

522
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.333
-What?
-Yeah. we're going to Cape Town.

523
00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.666
Oh. my God.

524
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.000
You know when we were fighting
yesterday I thought it was really over.

525
00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.958
But this trip is exactly what we need.

526
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:37.875
-Whoa.
-Yes.

527
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.291
Oh. my gosh. And I don't have
any catering gigs this week.

528
00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:47.416
So we can go to Cape Town and relax a bit.

529
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.083
Oh. my God. babe.

530
00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:51.500
The beach. Oh. the beach.

531
00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:55.750
Yoh. I have to do my hair. I can’t
go to Cape Town looking like this.

532
00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:57.875

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.916
-Listen babe. I mean…
-Yeah?

537
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:10.875
This Cape Town thing. I meant to say.

Kagiso. you know very well
that you and I have problems.

542
00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:25.666
But you want to go to Cape Town
with your friends.

543
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.083
Why are you making it seem
like it was my plan?

544
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.416
It wasn't my idea.

545
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.208
But no one twisted your arm either.

546
00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:33.666
-Why…
-You don't want to fix anything.

547
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.625
Nthabiseng. why are you
being like this right now?

548
00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:37.750
Seriously?

549
00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:40.750

No. man. You know. it's not like that.

00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:50.791
-Nothing's changed from yesterday. has it?
-Nthabiseng?

553
00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:53.833
Why do you always
have to drive yourself crazy?

554
00:33:53.916 --> 00:33:55.916
What’s your problem?

555
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.041
Seriously.

556
00:33:57.625 --> 00:34:01.208
It wasn't my idea.
Come on. man. Nthabiseng.

What have you done?

607
00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:58.250
It's dead. It's not breathing.

608
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:13.833
Can someone please take the wheel.
I can't drive anymore.

I never saw you and
your people here before.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.833
Or are you in the mood for a good time?

626

A big boer!

654
00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:54.000
Oh. my goodness. Thank goodness.

655

-Take care of yourself.
-Are you going to pay?

663
00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:46.000
Do you have the money
to pay for the Uber?

664
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.916
No. she'll pay for herself.

665
00:43:49.583 --> 00:43:51.208
I don't have money. my man.

666
00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:16.583
We're the last ones

667
00:44:16.666 --> 00:44:19.625
We are the last ones

668
00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:26.458
Look what we have here.

669
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:31.000

-Koos. what?
-What?

671
00:44:32.125 --> 00:44:35.083
Go! He's here. he's here! Go!

672
00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:49.541
There goes the love of my life.
Where will I get someone like him?

673
00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:51.333
Oh. my word!

674
00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:54.458
This night has been crazy.

675
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:55.583
Too much. man.

676
00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:20.291
Oh yeah. oh yes.

Oh. God.

678
00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:26.541
Hey. Ryan!

679
00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:28.333

You’re gonna pass Bedford West
without checking out your school.

682
00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:36.083
-What?
-Yes. sir.

683
00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.875
We're in Bedford.

684
00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:39.125

00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:45.416
Guys. guys. why?

688
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.750
You were a cheeseboy.
You grew up as a cheeseboy.

689
00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:51.000
-No. Let's go.
-We're not going anywhere.

690
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:56.125
Hey. boys. I like your wheels.

691
00:45:58.416 --> 00:46:00.583
Slap me with a wet fish.

692
00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:02.916
Hey. TP. is that you?

693
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.500

TP. you're looking good. man.

695
00:46:06.375 --> 00:46:09.166
-You put some beef on those bones?
-I guess so.

696
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.250
We're just travelling to Cape Town.

697
00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:14.916
Those are your friends?

698

But we're running a little bit late. sir.
So got to hit the road.

00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:20.833
Okay. Good to see you.

705
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.416
-Never.
-Dude. in this place. I was the plug.

706
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.583
No. I know. I see it.

707
00:46:37.666 --> 00:46:40.875
Hey. they don't make jammies
like this no more. hey?

708
00:46:43.208 --> 00:46:46.458
-Thought you were training?
-I love the way you travel. Toothpick.

709
00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:49.166
What?
What did you just call him now?

710
00:46:49.916 --> 00:46:53.041
Toothpick. We called him that
all through school.

711
00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:54.041
Come on guys.

712
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:56.416
Hey. let the man speak. man.

713
00:46:57.208 --> 00:46:59.166
No. You won't know this. hey.

714
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.250
But when he was here at school.
he had legs like toothpicks.

715
00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:03.750
-Okay.
-Yeah.

716
00:47:05.666 --> 00:47:08.625
Plus. at lunch time .
food got stuck in his braces.

717
00:47:09.583 --> 00:47:13.125
All the kids would say. "Hey.
toothpick. how's about a toothpick?"

718
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:16.208
Ready to go. Bye. Mr. Fourie.
Great to see you.

719
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:17.958
-Travel well. boys.
-Thank you.

720
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:20.250
Bye. Mr. Fourie.

721
00:47:20.333 --> 00:47:21.916
Goodbye.

722
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.958
Okay.

723
00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:35.416
Mr. Fourie. huh?

724
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:54.541
You know what?

725
00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:59.625
There's something I want to share
with you guys. I have a problem.

726
00:47:59.708 --> 00:48:02.416
You know. every time I eat.

727
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.875
Brian. I swear…
I will drive this car off the road.

728
00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:10.666
Hey. just relax. man.
There's nothing a toothpick can't fix.

729
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.916
-Brian. I swear. if you don't stop. man.
-Ah. listen…

730
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.541
Listen. my man.
We all love you in the car.

731
00:48:16.625 --> 00:48:19.500
We all love you.
And I love you so much.

732
00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:21.666
that I'm willing to upgrade you to…

733
00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:24.791
Handlebars!

734
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:52.416
Guys.

735
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.958
Guys. guys.

736
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.208
Guys. guys. guys.

737
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:57.125
Wake up. Wake up. Look.

738
00:48:57.791 --> 00:48:59.750
-Cape Town.
-Yeah!

739
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:02.166
We're in Cape Town. baby.

740
00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:10.916
Siya!

741
00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:18.583
I would like to propose a toast
to Paul and Lesedi.

742
00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:21.708
Ever since I met you…

743
00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:25.791
I knew you'd be the one. Yeah.

744
00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:29.250
Cheers!

745
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:33.750
Whoa. What now?

746
00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:36.250
I didn't order any pizza.

747
00:49:37.916 --> 00:49:38.916
Come on.

748
00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:41.125
Eish.

749
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:54.875
Surprise!

750
00:49:57.458 --> 00:49:59.333
-What the hell?
-Hey!

751
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:02.208
Move.
Move. move. move.

752
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:04.125
You're not gonna let us in. baby?

753
00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:05.041
Well…

754
00:50:05.708 --> 00:50:06.875
Brian's already in.

755
00:50:06.958 --> 00:50:08.833
-What up. son?
-What up. KG.

756
00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:11.791
-Hi. Paul.
-Gigi.

757
00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:14.833
What's up. Paulie?

758
00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:23.416
Lesedi. Lesedi?

759
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:28.500
Yo. it's like a morgue in here. man.

760
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:34.500
Oh. my God. Paul.

761
00:50:37.958 --> 00:50:39.708
I think we need some light.

762
00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:41.791
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

763
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:44.958
What are you guys doing here?

764
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:48.666
Eish.

765
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:52.666
Hey man. Eish.

766
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.708
Much better.

767
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:58.291
What the hell guys?

768
00:50:58.375 --> 00:51:01.416
What do you mean?
We came here for you. man.

769
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.708
Well. you see me.

770
00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:06.250
-But we came here to surprise you. bro.
-Well. I am surprised.

771
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:09.583
What's up?

772
00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:12.208
Jissis.

773
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:14.958
Bra. that girl played you dirty.

774
00:51:15.041 --> 00:51:18.291
-Cool it. Brian.
-She took everything.

775
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:22.750
But I told you that you’re
proposing to a criminal.

776
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:24.000
A real criminal.

777
00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:26.708
Hey man. Forget about him.

778
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:28.666
We came here to cheer you up.

779
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.583
Speaking about cheering up.
Cheering up means drinking immediately.

780
00:51:32.666 --> 00:51:35.666
Yes.

781
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.125
You… Wait.

782
00:51:37.208 --> 00:51:39.208
Do you still have that pulling jacket?

783
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:41.666
-That angry one.
-The angry one!

784
00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.333
Wait. Wait. Stop!

785
00:51:53.458 --> 00:51:55.583
-Fine.
-Yes.

786
00:51:55.666 --> 00:51:57.500
Come on. brother.

787
00:51:57.583 --> 00:51:59.166
Okay. wait. wait. wait.

788
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:03.125
Can we at least. as your friends.
order you a couch?

789
00:52:03.208 --> 00:52:06.291
-I'm not dealing with this in the morning.
-No worries. I got an app.

790
00:52:06.375 --> 00:52:07.416
-See?
-Let's go party.

791
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.833
Paul Sithole. Jean to jean.
Now I know you.

792
00:52:11.916 --> 00:52:13.916
-Yeah.
-Now you're looking fresh.

793
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:41.666
This is my song. guys.

794
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.916
It's my favorite song.

795
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.666
Thanks. guys. it's my favorite.

796
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:48.083
Gigi!

797
00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:02.500
Oh my gosh. you bitches

798
00:53:02.583 --> 00:53:05.125
made me cover for all your
shenanigans with your parents.

799
00:53:05.208 --> 00:53:07.833
Yeah. Well. that's
because you were always the old…

800
00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:09.500
-Uh-huh.
-Old what?

801
00:53:10.708 --> 00:53:12.250
-Smartest one.
-Yeah.

802
00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:13.291
That's true.

803
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.041
What's up with our boy?
I've never seen him dance like this.

804
00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:34.708
Only when he's DJing. right?

805
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:37.916
Kagiso is trying to get over
Nthabi shame.

806
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:40.041
They broke up. again?

807
00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:41.708
Yeah!

808
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:43.625
Well. look. I'm not going
to blame the guy.

809
00:53:43.708 --> 00:53:45.458
I know what that feels like.

810
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:46.666
Yeah.

811
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:49.166
-I'm sorry. man.
-Hey. but let's drink.

812
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:51.583
-That's why we're here. hey.
-Yeah. baby.

813
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.416
You're very delicious.

814
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.125
Oh. my God.

815
00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:50.833
Hey. wake up!

816
00:54:50.916 --> 00:54:52.708
Hmm.

817
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:54.166
Oh. my God.

818
00:55:02.208 --> 00:55:03.791
Oh my God. Why?

819
00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:05.958
I… I need Haarlemensis.

820
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.166
Where's Brian?

821
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.208
Where's Brian?

822
00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:15.833
I don't know.

823
00:55:18.708 --> 00:55:19.916
Brian?

824
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.500
Oh. my…

825
00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:33.458
Ah. Brian?

826
00:55:34.666 --> 00:55:35.666
Brian?

827
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.250
Come on. man.

828
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:41.583
What are you doing here?

829
00:55:42.875 --> 00:55:43.958
Come on.

830
00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:48.708
Where's Kagiso?

831
00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:52.958
Um. I think he left with a…

832
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:54.958
gone home with a girl.

833
00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:58.583
He was very drunk last night.

834
00:55:59.708 --> 00:56:00.708
Ouch.

835
00:56:01.416 --> 00:56:03.041
God. what happened?

836
00:56:05.416 --> 00:56:06.958
Yeah. well. guys…

837
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:09.583
We had an argument about Nthabi earlier.

838
00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.875
Are you going to change Kagiso?

839
00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:13.166
For Nthabi.

840
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:15.833
Yeah.

841
00:56:15.916 --> 00:56:19.000
Okay. Steve. I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

842
00:56:19.833 --> 00:56:23.625
I don't appreciate you guys being
in my business with Nthabi and I.

843
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.541
Look at Paul.

844
00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:28.750
And yourself.

845
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:32.041
You're a single father.

846
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:35.666
How's about you change that first
and then we'll talk.

847
00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:41.875
And he was pissed off.

848
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:46.958
Maybe he took the first flight out
and went to see the love of his life.

849
00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:50.750
You’re too extreme
when it comes to romance.

850
00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:52.375
Too extreme.

851
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:54.750
Hey. guys.

852
00:56:56.291 --> 00:56:57.291
His phone is off.

853
00:56:58.583 --> 00:57:00.875
Yo! But I’m experienced.

854
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:04.791
I think we need to go back to the club.

855
00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:06.791
Because we left two hours ago.

856
00:57:06.875 --> 00:57:07.875
You know what?

857
00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.666
I think going back to the club
is worth a shot.

858
00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:13.791
I see what you did there. Stevie.

859
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.916
Shot my boy.

860
00:57:16.458 --> 00:57:17.458
Shot.

861
00:57:29.416 --> 00:57:30.791
Morning.

862
00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:31.708
Morning.

863
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:33.000
How are you?

864
00:57:35.458 --> 00:57:37.500
So. we were here last night--

865
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:45.583
And we were hoping that you've seen
our friend. Kagiso or remember him.

866
00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:48.625
Let me get the manager for you.
Thank you.

867
00:57:50.708 --> 00:57:53.166
Sorry. it's just the effect of alcohol.

868
00:57:54.583 --> 00:57:55.958
I don't know why…

869
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:57.833
Okay. so now that we're here.

870
00:57:57.916 --> 00:58:00.666
do you remember anything?
Does it ring a bell. any of this?

871
00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:03.833
Hey. man. I was drunk.

872
00:58:04.458 --> 00:58:06.083
Good morning. gentlemen.

873
00:58:08.166 --> 00:58:10.791
You are the family of Kagiso.
I understand.

874
00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:12.375
Yeah. we are!

875
00:58:13.083 --> 00:58:16.875
I'm so. so terribly sorry for your loss.

876
00:58:17.833 --> 00:58:19.541
Would you like to follow me?

877
00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:22.625
-Loss?
-An animal?

878
00:58:24.416 --> 00:58:25.416
Who?

879
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:36.208
Over there is where it happened
and it was all over so quickly.

880
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.625
Again. my condolences.

881
00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.791
If you need anything.
I'll be in my office.

882
00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:49.541
I'm sorry. but I'm not willing
to accept this.

883
00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.250
Hey man.

884
00:58:59.583 --> 00:59:01.041
The head?

885
00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:18.333
Guys…

886
00:59:18.416 --> 00:59:19.583
um…

887
00:59:20.541 --> 00:59:24.166
-Kagiso doesn't have a head anymore.
-There's no time for jokes. man.

888
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.500
I'm not joking.

889
00:59:27.333 --> 00:59:29.416
His… his body was here…

890
00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:33.791
and his head was here.

891
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:39.541
-and his head is still wearing the cap.
-Look. guys. we need to call Nthabi.

892
00:59:39.625 --> 00:59:41.666
-Someone has to do it.
-You know what. let me call her.

893
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.625
Let me call her.

894
00:59:53.375 --> 00:59:54.250
Hello?

895
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:57.500
Nthabiseng.
Nthabi. Gigi wants to talk to you.

896
00:59:58.333 --> 00:59:59.375
Hi.

897
00:59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.833
Hi. Hi. Nthabi sweetie. Um…

898
01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:07.708
Kagiso isn't with you
by any chance. is he?

899
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.208
Um… No. Why?

900
01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.791
-So last n--
-Hello. Nthabi.

901
01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:18.500
No. don't worry. Nthabi.
thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

902
01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.166
Well. that call couldn't
have gotten any worse.

903
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:49.958
Damn. Damn you!

904
01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:54.208
Jesus!

905
01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:56.375
Gents.

906
01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:03.250
Oh. man. Where the hell
have you guys been?

907
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:06.500
And Paul…

908
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:10.208
I had to sign for your couch man.

909
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:12.791
Oh. my gosh.

910
01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:15.041
What the hell. Kagiso?

911
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:16.291
What?

912
01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:18.708
Hey. listen.
What happened to you. my bra.

913
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.625
Oh. shit. Last night?

914
01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:29.375
Yeah. No. it was just some girl. man.

915
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.333
My bra…

916
01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:34.083
I just saw you without a head.

917
01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:36.416
I mean I…

918
01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:39.666
-Do I look like I am headless guys?
-Seriously.

919
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.625
There was an accident last night
that killed a Kagiso and…

920
01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:45.041
we thought it was you.

921
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:48.875
No. man. that's…
Gigi that's horrible. bro. I'm sorry.

922
01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:51.041
-I'm sorry but…
-Oh. hell. no.

923
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.583
-No. no. no.
-What?

924
01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:56.291
You are going to tell us every detail
about what happened last night.

925
01:01:56.916 --> 01:01:58.750
You’re gonna give us the details.

926
01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.708
you’re gonna give us
all the details about sex.

927
01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:03.375
Yes. about sex.

928
01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:07.916
-Bra. spill it.
-It was just. you know. we made out.

929
01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.083
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

930
01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:12.916
Are you kidding me right now?

931
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.041
So you’re saying made out. make out?

932
01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:17.833
Yeah. What is that?

933
01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:20.541
-Hey. Brian. Come on. gents.
-Details now.

934
01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:26.666
-Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
-Spill it.

935
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.208
It was nice.

936
01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:32.500
Well… I… you know.

937
01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.708
Tow it up. tow it up.

938
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:37.500
My man. My man. You know what?

939
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.041
-I think this calls for a party.
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.

940
01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.833
Yeah. to celebrate me getting some. right?

941
01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:47.750
-No. To celebrate your life you fool.
-Your life.

942
01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:57.541
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

943
01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.875
I got the booze. I got the ladies.

944
01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:02.041
-Let's party.
-Hello!

945
01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:40.083
So I was kind of hoping that we pick up
from where we left off.

946
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:46.041
I think that's a great idea.
except no freaky peach things.

947
01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.750
Forget about it.

948
01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:35.916
Gents. listen. do you guys have any--

949
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.291
Co… Co…

950
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:41.250
Would you look at that?

951
01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:42.916
-Nthabi.
-Hey.

952
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:48.666
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I just thought that I would come…

953
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.375
Oh my God. baby.

954
01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:53.166
I thought something happened
when they called.

955
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.208
Are you okay?

956
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.750
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

957
01:04:56.833 --> 01:05:00.125
What do you mean. what I mean?
Hey. man. Fetch my phone.

958
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.083
Phone. Woman upstairs.

959
01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:06.541
-What is happening?
-How did you get here?

960
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.166
Nthabs. so what are you doing here?

961
01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:19.583
Did I not tell you that I'm coming
to Cape Town with my boys?

962
01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.208
Didn’t we break up?

963
01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:26.791
Come on. Kagiso. your friends called me
saying you disappeared.

964
01:05:27.666 --> 01:05:30.375
I couldn't shake the feeling
that something was off.

965
01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:33.666
Can’t you see I’m alive?
So what do you want here?

966
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.083
Kagiso. I flew all the way here.

967
01:05:36.916 --> 01:05:39.333
To check if you’re okay. if you’re alive.

968
01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:44.291
You're still not answering the question.
Why are you here?

969
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:53.416
-Why? Huh?
-You know what? You're right.

970
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.541
No one asked me to be here.

971
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.958
So don't worry.

972
01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.166
I'll go.

973
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.666
Are you crazy?

974
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.791
Just don't start with me. Gilbert.

975
01:06:22.875 --> 01:06:23.791
Just don't.

976
01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:25.791
-Okay.
-No. No. no. no.

977
01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:28.666
You have no right to use that name.

978
01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:34.125
Are you going to let her walk
out of your life like your mother?

979
01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:36.458
I dare you to mention my mother again.

980
01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:37.750
-Kagiso?
-I dare you.

981
01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:40.666
Kagiso. you are going to regret this.

982
01:06:41.958 --> 01:06:44.458
You know what I hate
about you married couple?

983
01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.375
What?

984
01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:50.583
You guys think you have it all figured
out. whereas you don't. You don't!

985
01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:56.583
You do you? Okay.
I'm going to go party.

986
01:06:56.666 --> 01:07:00.250
Yes. Fine. I'll do me. Go do you. Gilbert.

987
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:04.000
And don't you ever call me by
my government name again. ever.

988
01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:07.458
You are crazy.

989
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:26.041
These men are crazy.

990
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.125
What happened?

991
01:07:28.208 --> 01:07:30.458
This guy that I was hanging out with
yesterday.

992
01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.375
We made out and then he told me
to come back today.

993
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:38.625
And there I was. naked on his bed.

994
01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.875
He was going to get some
condoms. He never came back.

995
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.250
Okay. um…

996
01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.708
-Why don’t you ask him?
-Ask him where?

997
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:51.333
Some random dude came in
and kicked me out.

998
01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:58.041
Hey girl. where are you going?
I told you. these men are crazy.

999
01:07:58.125 --> 01:08:00.958
Did I tell you he asked for
some "Peaches" for sex?

1000
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.041
Peaches?

1001
01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.000
Yes.

1002
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:06.666
Apparently. it's a peaches thing
or something. What a creep.

1003
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:10.125
I thought I'd give this guy a second
chance. but it's not happening.

1004
01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.250
There's my Uber. I'm out of here.

1005
01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.458
Hey!

1006
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:35.625
Why do you want him.
but you don't want me?

1007
01:08:35.708 --> 01:08:38.416
Dude. Hey. just relax. okay?

1008
01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:43.833
Why do you want this guy.
but you don't want me?

1009
01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:45.416
I'm sorry.

1010
01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:49.208
I mean… I'm a good dancer.

1011
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.875
I'm not boring. Look.

1012
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:57.000
Brian. just…

1013
01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:59.833
Leave me. leave me. Leave me!

1014
01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:02.458
I’m not talking to you.

1015
01:09:03.958 --> 01:09:05.916
-Yeah. Okay.
-I'm talking to her.

1016
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.041
Yeah. well. I'm talking to her
right now. so please just go.

1017
01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:10.083
Please what?

1018
01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:13.208
You honestly think that someone's
going to choose you over me?

1019
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:14.833
Of course.

1020
01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:17.083
You are boring.

1021
01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:20.000
Oh. I'm boring.
Okay. well. you're a loser.

1022
01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:21.958
-I'm a loser?
-Yeah.

1023
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.541
-Loser?
-Loser.

1024
01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:26.333
I'm a loser. right?

1025
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.708
Because I'm…

1026
01:09:34.833 --> 01:09:36.541
-Get off.
-Ryan!

1027
01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:44.208
I’m going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you.

1028
01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:46.000
-I hate you.
-I hate you.

1029
01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:47.750
-I hate you.
-I hate you.

1030
01:09:47.833 --> 01:09:50.291
-You calling me?
-I hate you.

1031
01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:52.208
-Stop.
-Hey.

1032
01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:53.833
You have no idea.

1033
01:09:53.916 --> 01:09:54.875
What's going on?

1034
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:58.791
Where’s Mr. Sithole?
Mr. Sithole. what’s going on?

1035
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:00.750
I also don’t know. I’m sorry.

1036
01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:03.375
-What’s going on. guys?
-Can we please discuss this on the side?

1037
01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.583
Thank you.

1038
01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:12.625
I'm really sorry about what happened.

1039
01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.166
No. no. no. You guys failed us big time.

1040
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.750
As the estate securities.
you're supposed to notify us.

1041
01:10:18.833 --> 01:10:20.541
Let me give you a bottle.

1042
01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:23.000
Dlamini. Dlamini. Switch off.

1043
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:28.625
Why are you guys like this. huh?

1044
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.541
Huh?

1045
01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:34.083
Ah. are you two happy now?

1046
01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:39.208
-It’s this fool. You’re an idiot.
-I'm an idiot. Huh?

1047
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.541
You don't think people would miss you
when counting idiots?

1048
01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.125
You're just jealous?

1049
01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:47.333
No. over my dead body.
I'd never be jealous of you.

1050
01:10:47.416 --> 01:10:48.458
Never.

1051
01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:50.541
Do you know what your problem is?

1052
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:53.791
You think all of our women
are yours for the taking?

1053
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.041
-Nah bra.
-No?

1054
01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.958
I only came here
to have a drink with you.

1055
01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.208
-Oh.
-Wow.

1056
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:05.208
Wow. Here we go again.

1057
01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:08.791
-Is this about Tash?
-What? What about Tash?

1058
01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:11.958
-What?
-No one wants to get… Hey guys!

1059
01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:14.708
Stop it. Stop it!

1060
01:11:18.416 --> 01:11:19.416
Geez.

1061
01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.083
Nthabi. Nthabi!

1062
01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:24.750
Nthabi? Baby.

1063
01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:27.666
I’m leaving. I’m getting
out of your way with Khanyi.

1064
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.458
No man. nothing happened.

1065
01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:31.333
Okay.

1066
01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:33.791
So let me get this straight.

1067
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.333
Our four years together
can be replaced by nothing?

1068
01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:43.708
Baby. baby. I know how stupid this sounds.

1069
01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:46.333
I know.

1070
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:50.041
But trust me. nothing happened.

1071
01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:52.750
It does sound stupid.

1072
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:56.916
Babe.

1073
01:11:58.541 --> 01:11:59.875
Just please listen to me.

1074
01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:02.208
Please. Please. just listen.

1075
01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:05.458
I just don't want to be hurt anymore.

1076
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:11.166
By someone I would do anything for.

1077
01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.375
No.

1078
01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:15.916
Baby. I just realized.

1079
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.041
You're perfect for me.

1080
01:12:27.666 --> 01:12:30.083
You turn my house into a home.

1081
01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:34.000
You're one hell of a woman.

1082
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.250
And I don't want you to ever doubt that.

1083
01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:42.541
And I know I've got my own issues. okay?

1084
01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:47.791
And I know I've been selfish
and I'm really sorry.

1085
01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:53.833
Hey.

1086
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:55.833
Hey.

1087
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:04.291
I cannot expect you to come in
and out of my world as I please.

1088
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.958
And I'm out here saying. I'm sorry.

1089
01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:14.958
Please. Nthabi. please baby.

1090
01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:17.166
Please don’t leave me.

1091
01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:20.458
I love you.

1092
01:13:22.416 --> 01:13:23.458
I love you.

1093
01:13:24.916 --> 01:13:26.416
Baby. I'm so sorry.

1094
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.416
Okay.

1095
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.958
You wanna know why
I didn't sleep with her?

1096
01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:38.083
-It's because you were the only one.
-I know.

1097
01:13:38.625 --> 01:13:39.666
And I'm so sorry.

1098
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.041
I love you.

1099
01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:48.291
Uh. Nthabi. I'm waiting.

1100
01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:52.625
So sorry. my brother.

1101
01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:54.708
You can go. It's fine.

1102
01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:55.833
It's okay.

1103
01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:58.958
Why didn't you didn't say that
in the beginning of your speech…

1104
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:01.458
Oh. eish. I'm sorry. man.
gee. you know what?

1105
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.833
It's cool. It's cool.

1106
01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:06.375
-I don't have change. bro.
-No. no. Just keep it.

1107
01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:10.166
-This your thing. bra.
-I know. It's all good. It's all good.

1108
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.125
What happened. guys?

1109
01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:28.166
Cut the lights out.

1110
01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:31.000
Apparently. the party was too lit.

1111
01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:34.250
Yeah. because certain
people acted like kids.

1112
01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:35.458
Yeah.

1113
01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:37.416
Things got out of hand.

1114
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500
Hmm.

1115
01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.750
And speaking of hands.

1116
01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:46.500
Don't think I don't see you two
holding hands.

1117
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.750
But we'll discuss that later.

1118
01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:53.000
Right now. these two clowns
need to explain themselves.

1119
01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:55.875
I can't stand Brian anymore.

1120
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.791
There. I said it.

1121
01:14:57.875 --> 01:15:01.000
Well. I don't care about that.
I care about the why.

1122
01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:04.083
-He knows what he did.
-Hey. It was years ago. man.

1123
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.333
For goodness sake.

1124
01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:09.500
-Tasha was my first love. you asshole.
-So. how many girls did I have?

1125
01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.458
He doesn't care. Why the fuck
should I care about him?

1126
01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:13.666
No one should care.

1127
01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:15.833
-Hmm?
-Brian.

1128
01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:19.708
Ryan's house is open to you
whenever you want.

1129
01:15:19.791 --> 01:15:24.458
-Do want to speak to him like that?
-So Gigi. what must I do? Lick him?

1130
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:27.666
You know what your problem is?
You don't care about anything.

1131
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:31.541
That's why you don't care
you don't have a job. or a place.

1132
01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:33.583
All you do. is just use people.

1133
01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:38.166
You think I don't know that. huh?
You think I don’t know that?

1134
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.708
Everybody is always telling me
nonsense all the time.

1135
01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:44.208
You think I quit cigarettes.
all of you guys.

1136
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:46.041
Congratulating me.

1137
01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.208
Clapping hands.

1138
01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:51.083
Well. let me tell you something.
I didn't want to quit.

1139
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:54.750
I just. I couldn't afford
to buy myself cigarettes.

1140
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.708
I have nothing.

1141
01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:01.750
I can't even buy myself food.

1142
01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:06.833
Look.

1143
01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:13.708
I'm not saying you're a bad person.
I know… We all know life gets hard.

1144
01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:16.625
Okay. but what we…
What I want.

1145
01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:21.958
is for you to return that same care
that I give you. that's all.

1146
01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:23.000
Care?

1147
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:25.041
Do you know what care is. huh?

1148
01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:28.500
Is you throwing me
with. with keys. It's care?

1149
01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.916
It's not fucking care.

1150
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:34.000
And I got to pick them up
from the floor like I'm a dog.

1151
01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:35.416
I'm not a dog. man.

1152
01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:37.166
I'm human.

1153
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.125
I got feelings too.

1154
01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:42.833
None of you guys care about me.

1155
01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:46.916
My mom. my dad.

1156
01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:49.625
They don't care about me.

1157
01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:53.833
They're disappointed in me. bro.

1158
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:58.333
I am dead to my parents. dawg.

1159
01:16:58.416 --> 01:17:02.500
I'm alone and you guys come
and tell me about care.

1160
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.708
The only people that I love…

1161
01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.000
don't love me.

1162
01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:19.750
I'm so guilty of that too. bro.

1163
01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.208
Me too.

1164
01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:27.666
Even me.

1165
01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:29.666
Yeah.

1166
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.500
I'm sorry.

1167
01:17:43.541 --> 01:17:44.375
Love you. bro.

1168
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:47.000
I made you too. man.

1169
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.125
Ah!

1170
01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.708
Go hug it out. you guys.

1171
01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.583
-Bring it in.
-Sorry.

1172
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.541
Don't think I've forgotten
about the hand-holding.

1173
01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.666
-Nthabi?
-Yeah?

1174
01:18:16.416 --> 01:18:18.750
Oh. what did I do now?

1175
01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:22.750
Are you going to explain. or is he?

1176
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.083
-Peaches. I think you…
-You do it.

1177
01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:27.125
No. I'm not going to do it.

1178
01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.208
-You do it.
-Okay. cool.

1179
01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:30.875
Um…

1180
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.000
-We're in love guys.
-Yeah!

1181
01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.541
I knew it. man.

1182
01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:41.166
Oh. come here.

1183
01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:46.083
Oh. I knew it.

1184
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:47.958
Guys.

1185
01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:49.583
Somebody get the door now.

1186
01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:53.625
You know I have to…

1187
01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:02.458
Hi. babe.

1188
01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:07.791
Um. can we talk?

1189
01:19:22.666 --> 01:19:24.166
What is she doing here?

1190
01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:30.666
-Yeah. What are you doing here?
-Can we speak in private. please?

1191
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:31.750
Speak.

1192
01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:33.791
Yeah.

1193
01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:38.291
-Okay. I'm sorry about what I did.
-Don't touch me.

1194
01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:41.458
Where's the stuff. then?

1195
01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.625
Babe. I'm sorry I hurt you.

1196
01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:50.375
Hey. so you came here just
to clean up my friend's house?

1197
01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:52.625
Babe.

1198
01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:54.583
-if I could take it back. I would.
-Don't.

1199
01:19:54.666 --> 01:19:57.458
Meanwhile. why don't you
get yourself a time machine?

1200
01:19:57.541 --> 01:19:59.083
-Please. yeah.
-Guys…

1201
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.666
I can handle this.

1202
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:02.708
Paul.

1203
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.083
Are you sure?

1204
01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:08.333
Let’s go.

1205
01:20:09.375 --> 01:20:11.958
You must pay back the money.

1206
01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:13.708
Can you believe it?

1207
01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:17.166
Hey. guys. Guys. guys.

1208
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.041
Let's give them some privacy.
Let's go to the patio.

1209
01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:27.291
Thank you for the privacy.

1210
01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:32.541
I just wanted to hear what you
have to say after what you did to me.

1211
01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:34.750
Baby. please forgive me.

1212
01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:35.875
Just like that.

1213
01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:40.833
Babe. I know I can't take back what I did.
But I can't stop thinking about you.

1214
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:44.083
Well. I have stopped thinking about you.

1215
01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:45.083
What?

1216
01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:47.791
Really?

1217
01:20:49.916 --> 01:20:50.916
Really?

1218
01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.416
You see that one?

1219
01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:04.416
She must not take my friend again.
Come with her voodoo things.

1220
01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.500
I don't like that girl. man.

1221
01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:10.125
Yeah. yeah. We know you never liked her.
Okay? It's not like you hid it.

1222
01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:11.500
Hey. don’t you dare.

1223
01:21:11.583 --> 01:21:14.291
Me. I can smell a skank
20 kilometers away.

1224
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.625
Fine. But it's true.

1225
01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.500
You can't pretend you can
never call a woman bad names.

1226
01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.333
As if only good women exist.

1227
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.958
-He's right. guys.
-Thank you.

1228
01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:28.875
From personal experience.

1229
01:21:28.958 --> 01:21:31.375
Yeah. But in every bad.
there's good. right?

1230
01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:34.125
And I got myself a good one.

1231
01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:43.833
Lesedi. stop it.

1232
01:21:43.916 --> 01:21:46.041
Babe. But we're so good together.

1233
01:21:46.125 --> 01:21:49.250
No. wait. wait… Until when?
Until you come from my life policy.

1234
01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:50.333
Wow.

1235
01:21:50.916 --> 01:21:53.291
Wow. You just said wow.

1236
01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:56.083
Huh? And. like. leave.

1237
01:21:57.166 --> 01:21:58.250
Voetsek!

1238
01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.875
-You're saying voetsek to me.
-Yeah.

1239
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.375
-You're serious?
-Yes.

1240
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:05.291
That's… That's the same question
that my friends asked me

1241
01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:07.458
when I told them
about what you did to me.

1242
01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:09.041
Guys. guys. guys.

1243
01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:13.583
We're in a serious crisis. man.
Paul is probably being dumb right now.

1244
01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:14.666
Brian. Brian.

1245
01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:17.458
Just let Paul be.

1246
01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.458
He needs to sort this one out
by himself.

1247
01:22:20.541 --> 01:22:23.708
Oh well. let him hurry then.
because I mean.

1248
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:27.041
it only takes two seconds
to kick someone out of the house.

1249
01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:28.291
Hmm. You know what?

1250
01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.000
Let me go get him.

1251
01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:34.041
-No. Brian.
-No. I'm getting him.

1252
01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:36.333
-He'll come ba--
-Huh-uh.

1253
01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:37.500
Babe?

1254
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.458
Don't you miss this?
Yes. you do.

1255
01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:46.458
Lesedi. Satan.

1256
01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:49.375
Go!

1257
01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:50.500
I mean like…

1258
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.250
-Voetsek.
-No. I won't go.

1259
01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:55.041
This is my house. too.

1260
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:56.750
-What?
-We chose it together.

1261
01:22:56.833 --> 01:22:59.958
-Boss. is there a problem here?
-Uh. Zozo…

1262
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:04.666
Matter of fact. there is.
Please escort this criminal…

1263
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:06.708
-I'm not a criminal.
-…off my premises.

1264
01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:09.250
You know what? Yeah. Let's go.

1265
01:23:09.333 --> 01:23:12.708
I've been waiting to do this
ever since you put my job at risk.

1266
01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:16.500
And I'm going to give you
that stupid cheese platter of yours back.

1267
01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:18.208
-Let's go.
-Zozo. take her.

1268
01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.541
-Zozo. take her.
-Babe?

1269
01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.291
Take her. Zozo.

1270
01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:22.958
Babe!

1271
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.916
Paul. I hate you.

1272
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.416
-I hate you.
-I hate you. too.

1273
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.750
And bring back my furniture.

1274
01:23:28.833 --> 01:23:30.750
Or else you're going to jail.

1275
01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:31.833
And…

1276
01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.791
And voetsek.

1277
01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:40.333
Oh. my boy.

1278
01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:42.833
I love you. my boy.

1279
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.125
I love you. my boy.

1280
01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:48.458
I'm sorry. man.

1281
01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:52.541
How many times am I gonna
get my heart broken?

1282
01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:57.041
Um. Twice. three times. maybe four times.

1283
01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.291
Okay. okay. once. two.

1284
01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:02.291
Okay.

1285
01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:04.750
Yeah. I'm sorry man.

1286
01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:09.958
In the lounge. heading to the patio.

1287
01:24:10.041 --> 01:24:13.125
He's the current heavyweight
champion of the world.

1288
01:24:13.208 --> 01:24:17.083
Ladies and gentlemen. Paul Sithole.

1289
01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:20.041
Yeah!

1290
01:24:32.166 --> 01:24:35.500
Paul! Paul! Paul!

1291
01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:39.166
Paul-e. Paul-e. Paul-e.
Paul-e. Paul-e. Paul-e.

1292
01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:50.916
Guys.

1293
01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:53.375
from the bottom of my heart.

1294
01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:54.833
I just want to say thank you.

1295
01:24:55.583 --> 01:25:00.125
And for coming out all this way
just to support me.

1296
01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:01.500
Even you. Nthabi.

1297
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:05.375
Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

1298
01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:10.958
Man. we get it. You guys are
in love for the first time ever.

1299
01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:16.625
Paul. it was such a pleasure
to be here for you.

1300
01:25:16.708 --> 01:25:20.083
And remember. we're
only just a phone call away.

1301
01:25:20.166 --> 01:25:22.541
So you don't ever have to go
through anything alone. okay?

1302
01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:24.291
-Yes.
-Okay?

1303
01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:26.083
-Again.
-All right.

1304
01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:32.583
Are we ever going to stop
kidnapping random girls?

1305
01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:37.583
Damn girl. no hug? Nothing?

1306
01:25:38.208 --> 01:25:40.250
-Brian?
-Brian.

1307
01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:44.666
No. no. no. no. no. I don't
know the girl. I promise you.

1308
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:45.958
I don't know the girl.

1309
01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:48.125
Okay. Okay. Can I just say…

1310
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.875
to the best trip…

1311
01:25:53.791 --> 01:25:57.500
Ever!

1312
01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:21.708
Guys. look. it grew two centimeters
when we left Jo'burg. hey?

1313
01:26:21.791 --> 01:26:23.500
Yeah? Cool.

1314
01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:24.958
It's almost three now.

1315
01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:28.791
They say dreams come true
in Cape Town.

1316
01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:30.750
Cops. Guys. guys. guys. cops.

1317
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:32.666
Cops. Come on.

1318
01:26:37.208 --> 01:26:39.958
Outlaws. I've been
waiting for this opportunity.

1319
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.750
I don't think you can speak to…

1320
01:26:41.833 --> 01:26:45.041
Shut up. We're telling you.
This is serious.

1321
01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:46.458
Come. Brian.

1322
01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:51.958
Well. according to my view. ma'am.

1323
01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:56.208
you arrived here a second ago
and decided that this group

1324
01:26:56.958 --> 01:26:58.416
must be up to no good.

1325
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:02.708
-Who the hell do you think you are?
-I think I am advocate Gigi Madusi.

1326
01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:04.708
Google me.

1327
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:07.750
And for you to accuse us of being outlaws.

1328
01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:13.583
That's discrimination on
a thousand different levels.

1329
01:27:13.666 --> 01:27:15.625
Just because when you are a lawyer.

1330
01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:18.000
you think you must
take advantage of the law?

1331
01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:19.083
Yeah.

1332
01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:20.250
Hey. man.

1333
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.666
-I'm just doing my job here.
-We don't have time to waste.

1334
01:27:25.416 --> 01:27:27.458
Boys. let's go.

1335
01:27:32.916 --> 01:27:34.291
Ah. shit.

1336
01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:46.083
Money.

1337
01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:48.750
Just money. Don't you want some money?

1338
01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:50.041
I got some money.

1339
01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:54.416
Oh. it’s the guys.

1340
01:27:56.833 --> 01:27:59.166
I don’t know what to do with myself.

1341
01:28:00.583 --> 01:28:01.750
-Hi.
-Welcome everybody.

1342
01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:03.416
Welcome to my place.

1343
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.750
Boy. Paulie boy.

1344
01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:09.458
Look at all of this.

1345
01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:14.625
Hey. You’ve even gained some weight.

1346
01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:16.666
For real. dude. Insane.

1347
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:17.750
Yeah. congrats.

1348
01:28:17.833 --> 01:28:19.166
Thank you so much.

1349
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:20.958
-Let me show you around.
-Yes.

1350
01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:25.958
-Yes.
-Wow. Brian!

1351
01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:26.958
Guys. dig in.
