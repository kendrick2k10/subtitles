27
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.667
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.633
So Keats' love letter
to Fanny Brawne

29
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.800
is a classic example of
idealistic love in literature.

30
00:01:58.934 --> 00:01:59.533
For instance--

31
00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.333
"I cannot exist without you.

32
00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.734
I am forgetful of everything.
but seeing you again.

33
00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:07.533
My life seems to stop there.

34
00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.100
I see no further.

35
00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.000
You have absorb'd me."

36
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.433
So that seems a little needy.
if we're being honest. right?

37
00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:16.633
I mean. someone puts that note
on your door

38
00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:19.834
and you're taking out
a restraining order. am I right?

39
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.400
- Mm-hmm?
- It's escapism.

40
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.567
The realities of that era
were rough.

41
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.433
That's true.
Life expectancy was short.

42
00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:28.066
Keats died of tuberculosis
when he was 25.

43
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.166
That's so young!
How tragic.

44
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.033
Yes. But we relate
to the tragedy in literature

45
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.433
because. you know.
for so many of us.

46
00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:36.233
when it comes to love.

47
00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:38.900
the journey from aspiration
to fulfillment

48
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.867
is a very...

49
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.033
bumpy road.

50
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.166
Professor Rivera needs a date.

51
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.567
- Or a drink!
- All right.

52
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.500
So that's it for this week.

53
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:51.233
Next week is
"Ode On A Grecian Urn."

54
00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:53.600
Please read
and be prepared to discuss.

55
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:54.633
Thanks.

56
00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:02.400
- Hey!
- Hey.

57
00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:05.667
You. ahem. need
to pull yourself together.

58
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.900
What was that out there?

59
00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.266
Teaching.

60
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.233
Really? What class?
Cynicism 101?

61
00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.500
Mia. they're 19 years old.

62
00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:14.633
They're gonna have decades
of heartbreak ahead of them.

63
00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:16.133
You don't have to burst
their bubble just yet.

64
00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.333
I'm teaching my students
about reality.

65
00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.300
I think you're letting
your personal life

66
00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.333
cloud your judgment.

67
00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.233
I am not. Stop it.

68
00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.967
Don't you have papers
to grade or something?

69
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.133
Nope. Done.

70
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.166
Super-speedy when it comes
to the Peloponnesian War.

71
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.400
Come on. Mia! You used to see
the beauty in all of this.

72
00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:32.667
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

73
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.934
Oh. stop. please.

74
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.467
Hey! Penny Serenade is playing
at the Vogue tonight.

75
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.333
It's our favorite.
You're coming with me.

76
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.633
No. I can't.

77
00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:41.667
I've got the "appointment."

78
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.767
What?

79
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.133
That's done at 3:00.

80
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:45.066
You'll have plenty of time.

81
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.934
Derek's meeting
a new gallery owner.

82
00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:48.233
I don't want to sit there
like a sad-sack.

83
00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:49.667
And you have to stop
being such a shut-in.

84
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.567
I'm not a shut-in.

85
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.166
Okay. fine.
a marginal hermit. then.

86
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.166
You need a big. fat dose
of romance. girl!

87
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.667
Cary Grant. Irene Dunne.

88
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.166
Who better to bring you
out of that funk?

89
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.500
I'm not in a funk!

90
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:01.900
All hermits say that.

91
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.367
Fine.

92
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.033
I'll meet you
after the lawyer's office.

93
00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:07.166
Mm.

94
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.233
Oh. Hey. hey. hey. hey.

95
00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:11.667
Come here.

96
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.400
You're doing the right thing.

97
00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:14.633
- You are.
- I know.

98
00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:16.200
- Okay.
- Thanks.

99
00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.667
I'll have
the soda and popcorn ready.

100
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:20.567
And the wine?

102
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.300
Yeah. I'll get some wine.
I'll put it in a soda cup.

103
00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.333
Okay.

104
00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:24.900
- Goodbye!
- Bye.

105
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.000
You can wait
right over here with your...

106
00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:34.900
With her husband.

107
00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.834
Right.
Have a seat. Mrs. Malone.

108
00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:38.166
It's actually "Rivera" now.

109
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.667
Thank you.

110
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.233
I'll let Mr. Underwood
know you're here.

111
00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:42.333
Thanks.

112
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.200
Sweetheart--

113
00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.834
Don't call me that.

114
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:50.533
This is ridiculous.

115
00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:53.633
I don't want a divorce.

116
00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:55.967
We're a family.
We belong together.

117
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.000
Think about Rosie.

118
00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:59.066
I am doing this for Rosie.

119
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.367
Come on.

120
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.900
We can still find a place.

121
00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:06.200
These short-term rentals
are a fortune.

122
00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:07.166
And why are we

123
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.400
in the short-term rentals
again. Casey?

124
00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm 90 days sober.
you know.

125
00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:16.233
I know.

126
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.400
I know. I'm proud of you.

127
00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:20.667
I know how hard
you've been working.

128
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.200
Come on. Mia.

129
00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.233
Look me in the eyes--
look me in the eyes--

130
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.734
and you tell me
that it was all bad.

131
00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.567
Of course. it wasn't all bad.

132
00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:31.900
It was. uh...

133
00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.133
when it was good.
it was great.

134
00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:35.900
But...

135
00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.367
Sweetheart. I--

136
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.900
No.

137
00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:42.000
We lost our house... Casey.

138
00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:47.433
W-We-- We can't count on you anymore.

139
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.967
I'm sorry to interrupt.
but Mr. Underwood is ready.

140
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.300
So am I.

141
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.300
Really?

142
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.000
One kiss?
That's all it takes to know?

143
00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:22.800
From Cary Grant?
Absolutely.

144
00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:24.600
Shh!

145
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:25.734
Oh. now. darling.

146
00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:26.667
you're not going to be
one of those wives...

147
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.467
Yeah. I mean.
Cary Grant's Cary Grant.

148
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
but kisses can be misleading.

149
00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:33.367
Maybe you just haven't
been kissed properly.

150
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.133
Now. do you mind?
We're trying to watch a movie.

151
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.033
You see that young man?

152
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:44.033
That's my son. Anthony.

153
00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.667
Isn't he gorgeous?

154
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.967
He's very handsome.

155
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.000
Oh. and that one.

156
00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:52.300
with a napkin for the skirt?

157
00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:54.266
Yeah. that's his date.

158
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.867
I feel for her.

159
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.033
I mean. clearly.
nobody raised her right.

160
00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:00.834
See. I taught my daughter
about self-respect.

161
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:01.900
Thank you.

162
00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:03.834
Which is
why she's single again.

163
00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:04.767
after 12 years.

164
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.600
Mm.

165
00:07:05.734 --> 00:07:07.400
Come on!

166
00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:09.266
You're smart. you're beautiful.
you should know better.

167
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.233
Shh!

168
00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.233
Second time.

169
00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh! Look who can count.

170
00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.500
That's her.

171
00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:17.000
That's my Mia.

172
00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:19.834
She's the one giving your son
the hard time.

173
00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.400
She's been
in a bit of a mood lately.

174
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:24.333
- Who's her date?
- Oh. no. no. no.

175
00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.367
He's not a date. That's Nick.
He's her best friend.

176
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.367
She just filed for divorce--

177
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.934
- Oh.
- ...After 12 years.

178
00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:30.066
The ex-husband

179
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.233
went through all their money

180
00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:33.867
on booze
and bad judgment.

181
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.934
I mean. not a bad guy--

182
00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:36.667
I tried to warn her about him.

183
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.567
Who listens to their mother?

184
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.934
Ah! They just don't know
how to pick 'em anymore.

185
00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.867
I just want Anthony
to find someone.

186
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.734
Yeah. Settle down
with somebody nice.

187
00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.333
- Yeah. Down-to-earth!
- Reliable.

188
00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:49.767
- So I can have some peace!
- So I can have some peace!

189
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.767
Exactly.

190
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.900
Sofia Romano.

191
00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:55.734
- Marlene Schwartz-
- Rivera.

192
00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:57.200
Now. that's a mouthful.

193
00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:01.667
You know. my-my son
is a singer.

194
00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:04.166
He's got a voice like butter.

195
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.200
Eh. good thing

196
00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:07.300
there's no high-cholesterol
in my family.

197
00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:08.500
- Ah!
- My daughter

198
00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.400
is a professor
at a university.

199
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.633
Very smart.
But with a personality.

200
00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:17.633
Oh. yeah? Well. my Anthony's
got so much compassion in him.

201
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.834
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinking?

202
00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:24.834
Well. if your Anthony's
this mensch you say he is.

203
00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:26.633
we might be
on the same page.

204
00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:28.834
- Like a set-up?
- A set-up. But...

205
00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.567
they can't know
that we're behind it.

206
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.834
They've got to find each other
on their own.

207
00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:35.166
think it's their idea.

208
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.767
I can't agree more!

209
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.633
Let's get to work.

210
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:39.667
I agree.

211
00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:41.900
After the deductions.

212
00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:43.000
we got 10.000.

213
00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:44.400
[Irene Dunne. as Julie] 10.000?

214
00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:45.467
Oh. I love this moment.

215
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.834
[Cary Grant. as Roger] Uh-huh.

216
00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:48.400
I still got a couple of thousand
in bills to pay around here.

217
00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:49.600
Well. then.

218
00:08:49.734 --> 00:08:50.800
- you've really only got 8.000.
- Lucky girl.

219
00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:52.133
[Cary Grant. as Roger] Yes.
but did you ever see...

220
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.066
I'll say.

221
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.800
...that much money
in your life.

222
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.967
Rosie! Come on. hurry.
You're gonna miss the bus.

223
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.900
And I want to get a run in.
before class.

224
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:08.000
Here.

225
00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:09.000
What is this?

226
00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:10.333
It's a waffle!

227
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.333
It's a delicious
homemade waffle.

228
00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:14.133
Come on!
My cooking's not that bad.

229
00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.333
It's not that good. either.

230
00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:17.033
Okay. You have to take the bus
home from school today

231
00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:18.000
because Daddy has to work

232
00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:20.066
and I need to look
at some apartments.

233
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.400
Why we can't just find
a place with Daddy?

234
00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:23.233
Honey. I told you.
It's complicated.

235
00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:24.967
Only because
you're making it complicated.

236
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.000
He wants us together.

237
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.200
Sweetheart. I'm not
having this conversation

238
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.533
with you again. okay?

239
00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:30.033
One day. hopefully.
you're gonna understand.

240
00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.367
I'll never understand.

241
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.800
I'm not hungry.

242
00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:34.967
Okay. Fine.

243
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.166
Look both ways.

244
00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:41.333
Meow.

245
00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:42.867
This is ridiculous.

246
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Sofia. it is never
gonna work.

247
00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.300
Tony is very superstitious.

248
00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:48.500
He got it from my mother.

249
00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:49.967
We all got it from her.

250
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.066
Daily.

251
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.100
Oh! Here he comes.

252
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.200
- Whoa. whoa.
- Whoa.

253
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:56.300
You see?

254
00:09:56.433 --> 00:09:58.000
- Hey.
- Hey-hey-hey.

255
00:09:58.133 --> 00:09:58.967
Oh. it's so good--

256
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.333
Okay. I am putting my trust
in you and this. uh. mishegas.

257
00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:05.734
but I've got my doubts.

258
00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:08.533
Yeah. you've had
a lot of those lately.

259
00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.367
But listen. Listen. trust me.

260
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.867
I know what I'm walking about.

261
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:14.166
Okay.

262
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.800
Here we go.
Mia's going towards him...

263
00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:18.033
there's the target.

264
00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:19.166
Okay. you say "target."

265
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.133
I say "beautiful boy
with a voice like an angel."

266
00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:23.834
You sure you're ready
to let him go?

267
00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:25.367
Uh. yes. Okay.

268
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.467
Three...

269
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.166
two. one--
no traffic.

270
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.633
Go. baby. go!

271
00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:33.033
- See you later.
- Okay.

272
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.233
I'm so sorry.

273
00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:44.333
That cat ran
right in front of me.

274
00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:45.967
- Are you all right?
- Seriously?

275
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.066
You plowed into me because
a black cat crossed your path?

276
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.734
It's a family thing.
Let me help you up.

277
00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:51.300
No. I'm fine. thank you.
You've done enough.

278
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:52.233
You're a health hazard.

279
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:54.000
Hey. Have we met before?

280
00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:55.867
No. I think
I would remember you.

281
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.900
Stop. I'm flattered.

282
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.333
Hey. I-I feel terrible
about this.

283
00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:01.100
Let me. uh.
make it up to you.

284
00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:03.233
Coffee? Cupcake? Cocktail?

285
00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:04.433
Uh. I'm fine.

286
00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:06.533
but actually. you know what.
you might need some help.

287
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:07.600
What?

288
00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:08.934
Oh. it's just that grown men

289
00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:10.433
are usually not afraid
of kitty cats.

290
00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:13.734
I don't like to take chances
when it comes to luck.

291
00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:15.133
You know.
Ralph Waldo Emerson says

292
00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.467
"Shallow men believe in luck.

293
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.734
Strong men
believe in cause and effect."

294
00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:19.700
Wow. 30 seconds in.

295
00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:21.100
and you're already
calling me shallow?

296
00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:22.433
I'm merely quoting Emerson.

297
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.400
Well. let me prove you
and Emerson wrong.

298
00:11:24.533 --> 00:11:26.100
Does this usually
work for you?

299
00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:27.767
Just turn on the charm.
and then women

300
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.800
are putty in your hands?

301
00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:30.033
I have my moments.

302
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:31.600
- Well. I'm immune.
- To charm?

303
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:33.266
To men like you.
Have a nice day!

304
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.600
Oh. and. um. watch out
for the kitty cats.

305
00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:36.934
You--
Watch out for that ladder!

306
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:38.033
No! Ah--!

307
00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:40.300
Ho...

308
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.934
He likes her!

309
00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:46.734
And she hates him!

310
00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:48.567
- It's perfect!
- It's perfect!

311
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.767
See. Mia is renting
a mailbox here. so...

312
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.533
♪ I'll just stick this inside! ♪

313
00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:11.433
And my nonna used to say
you can

314
00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:13.800
tell a lot about a person
by the lines on their hand.

315
00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.033
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:16.100
May I?

317
00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:18.200
Oh! Interesting.

318
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:19.166
What do you see?

319
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.200
Well. see. this...
is your life line--

320
00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:22.667
nice and long. good for you--

321
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.700
and this...

322
00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:25.367
is your love line.

323
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.300
Oh? And what does
my love line say?

324
00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:28.333
Well. let's see.

325
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:29.600
It says...

326
00:12:29.734 --> 00:12:31.166
you're gonna meet someone...

327
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.367
charming. handsome...

328
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.467
and he's gonna
sweep you off your feet.

329
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.300
I think you might be right...

330
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.300
...because my husband
just walked in the door.

331
00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:44.667
Hey.

332
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.600
Thanks for the drink.

333
00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:48.100
Okay.

334
00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:50.800
Ahh...

335
00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:53.867
So...

336
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.367
I'm guessing the movie
didn't have a happy ending.

337
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.367
Francesca's sweet
and everything.

338
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.233
but I'm afraid she's not
gonna be my leading lady.

339
00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:01.900
But what can you do. Jack?

340
00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:03.266
You win some.
you lose some.

341
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.433
Tony.

342
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:05.734
You're a good guy.

343
00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:08.200
Stop the chase.
Find a nice girl.

344
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.100
You sound like my mother.

345
00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:11.900
Come on.
Settling down isn't so bad.

346
00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:14.200
And it's been years
since Katie.

347
00:13:14.333 --> 00:13:16.834
But this is so much more fun.

348
00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:30.767
Hmm.

349
00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:45.066
And it's got
marble countertops.

350
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.100
stainless-steel appliances.

351
00:13:48.233 --> 00:13:49.433
and a gas stove.

352
00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:51.867
Look at this natural light.
It's gorgeous!

353
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.500
Yeah. this light
is amazing.

354
00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.367
It's so much better
than my last place.

355
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.400
That other place
was like a coffin!

356
00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:59.667
This. the energy is sublime.

357
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.233
They're asking
two months' security deposit.

358
00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:03.600
plus first and last month's
rent upfront.

359
00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:05.934
Mm-kay.
Do they want my first-born. too?

360
00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:06.967
Bite your tongue!

361
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.400
They're not gettin' my Rosie.

362
00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.400
It's got two large bedrooms.

363
00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:11.467
And it's in Brooklyn!

364
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.066
What else could you ask for?

365
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.133
Aw. come on!
Look at this.

366
00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:17.767
You can see the Brooklyn Bridge
right from here.

367
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.266
Wow. Yeah.
This view is spectacular.

368
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.133
That's why
it's gonna go fast.

369
00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:23.600
I wouldn't sit on it.

370
00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:26.100
I would go for it. honey.

371
00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:28.600
Okay. I'm gonna take it.

372
00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.667
- Yes!
- Excellent choice.

373
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.000
Mazel tov!

374
00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:33.433
- Wow.
- Love it?

375
00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:35.667
Gosh. where am I gonna
put my stuff?

376
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.100
- Anywhere! It's yours!
- I know. it's enormous.

377
00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:39.266
Let's go take a look.

378
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.567
- When do we move in?
- Gotta get that.

379
00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:52.066
Ah! You are
completely ridiculous.

380
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.633
I haven't eaten since Thursday.
How'd you think it'd go?

381
00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:56.000
Way to go. everyone.
Very good job.

382
00:14:56.133 --> 00:14:58.500
Way to go. men.
Don't forget to tip them well.

383
00:14:58.633 --> 00:15:00.367
It looks like you two
have a lot of junk.

384
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.967
Oh. Those don't look
like moving clothes.

385
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.200
Honey. the only thing
I'm moving is

386
00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.400
- a martini closer to my mouth.
- Mm-mm!

387
00:15:07.834 --> 00:15:08.967
But we did bring you
an orchid.

388
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.533
Oh. thank you. I love it.

389
00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:12.467
Its name is "Lenny."
Please don't kill it.

390
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.967
Yeah. I'll try.

391
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.000
I'll take care of it. Derek.

392
00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:16.734
- Not necessary. Rosie-
- Posie.

393
00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:18.200
If her cooking
is any indication.

394
00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:20.033
we thought it'd be best
to buy her something

395
00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:21.000
a little low-maintenance.

396
00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:22.133
You know her well.

397
00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:23.300
Mom. this is Isabella.

398
00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:24.900
I met her upstairs.
She's across the hall from us.

399
00:15:25.033 --> 00:15:26.367
Oh. great! Hi.

400
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.567
It's so nice to finally have

401
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.233
someone my own age
in the building.

402
00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:30.233
Everyone here is so old.

403
00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:33.900
Uh. it's nice to meet you. Isabella.

404
00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.567
Is it okay if I show her
the rec room in the basement?

405
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.333
- There's a pool table.
- Oh. sure.

406
00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:39.400
Just come right back up. okay?
We got a lot of unpacking to do.

407
00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:41.233
Okay. Ciao.

408
00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:42.367
Ciao!

409
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.533
"Ciao"?

410
00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:45.667
What is she. Sophia Loren?

411
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.633
Don't know. I'm just glad
Rosie found someone her own age.

412
00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:48.700
Maybe she's not
gonna hate me too much

413
00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:49.667
for moving her to Brooklyn.

414
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.900
Oh. please.

415
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.667
She'll be a hipster by Friday
and all will be forgiven.

416
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.300
We can all hope.

417
00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:56.633
Martini glasses?

418
00:15:56.767 --> 00:15:58.567
Yes. let's do that. Ahem!

419
00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.900
Have you forgotten
about last night?

420
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.367
Completely.
Completely forgotten.

421
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500
- No clue.
- Oh. my gosh.

422
00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:05.033
No. lift with your knees.
You lift with your knees.

423
00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:07.367
This is what the pros are for.
Come here.

424
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.166
- You lift with your back.
- Here. pillows.

425
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.200
Okay. good.
Thank you.

426
00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.233
Okay.

427
00:16:17.567 --> 00:16:18.533
Oh. my gosh!

428
00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:19.533
I'm so sorry. I--

429
00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:22.867
- You.
- Look.

430
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.233
If you wanted to see me again.
all you had to do was ask.

431
00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:26.567
That is so not what this is.

432
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.200
So. you're the new neighbor.

433
00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:29.800
How's that for lucky geography?

434
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:31.700
- What are the odds?
- Slim to none.

435
00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.200
So it must be fate.

436
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.567
Or maybe it's my Karma.

437
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.867
Hey.

438
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.066
Was that your daughter I saw
playing with my niece earlier?

439
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.467
Oh. Isabella's your niece?

440
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.867
My sister
travels for business a lot.

441
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.433
so Bella stays with me
when she's gone.

442
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:44.633
So...

443
00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:46.567
looks like we're gonna be
seeing a lot of each other.

444
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.600
Lucky for me.

445
00:16:47.734 --> 00:16:48.600
Anything you need...

446
00:16:48.734 --> 00:16:50.433
I'm right across the hall.

447
00:16:50.567 --> 00:16:51.367
Gonna be hard to forget that.

448
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.300
Any time.

449
00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:54.600
Day or night.
Don't hesitate to knock.

450
00:16:54.734 --> 00:16:55.700
And I won't either.

451
00:16:55.834 --> 00:16:57.033
Or don't.

452
00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.367
Oh? Okay.

453
00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:02.500
Recycling's on the other side
of the hall.

454
00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:05.033
Thanks.

455
00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:14.266
Oh. he'll win her over.
you'll see...

456
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.166
my precious little angel.

457
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.033
She can't stand
your precious little angel.

458
00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:21.033
Oh. well. it's a good thing
that he likes a challenge.

459
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.100
Oh. So. you're saying
he's in it for the conquest?

460
00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:25.867
Well. if she's as good
as you say she is--

461
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.033
She's better.

462
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:28.500
He's needs to step up his game.

463
00:17:28.633 --> 00:17:31.033
If anyone can conquer
her cold. dead heart.

464
00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:32.600
it's my Anthony.

465
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:34.033
I hope he's worth it.

466
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.200
Oh. he is.

467
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:36.867
He is.

468
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:42.667
♪ Mm ♪

469
00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:46.200
Wow! Ow!

470
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:48.033
What are you doing?

471
00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:49.200
Rehearsing.

472
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.033
Life is a show. Bella.

473
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:53.467
Can't have a student over
without my favorite accessory.

474
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.533
Of course you can.

475
00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:56.700
No! No-no-no-no!

476
00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.500
No hats on the bed.
It's bad luck.

477
00:17:58.633 --> 00:18:00.500
Now she's definitely
not gonna like you.

478
00:18:00.633 --> 00:18:01.867
Who?

479
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.667
The lady across the hall.

480
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.000
Who says I want her to?

481
00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:06.600
Do I look new here?

482
00:18:06.734 --> 00:18:08.166
Hey! Mind
your own business. kid.

483
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.467
Beat it.
I've got a lesson.

484
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.934
Now!

485
00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:16.533
Rah-ah!

486
00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:19.166
Ahh.

487
00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:35.266
Is Rosie home?

488
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.300
Uh. she's changing.

489
00:18:36.433 --> 00:18:38.500
Can you tell her
to text me when she's done?

490
00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:40.200
Uh. she doesn't have a phone.

491
00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.266
Audrey. hey. Come on in.

492
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.266
Oh. Why?

493
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.266
Yeah. Mom.
Why don't I have a phone?

494
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.600
Dad said it's okay.

495
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:48.100
Because we've talked about this

496
00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:50.367
and you're gonna get one
in middle school.

497
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.266
That's when I got mine.

498
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.467
See?

499
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000
So my uncle is taking me
to the arcade in. like. an hour.

500
00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:56.333
Do you want to go?

501
00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:58.567
Just you two
and your uncle?

502
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Please. Mom. Can I go?

503
00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:03.233
You told me to embrace the move.
This is me embracing it.

504
00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:05.934
Yeah. but I really don't want
you going alone with that guy.

505
00:19:06.066 --> 00:19:07.834
With a stranger...

506
00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:09.567
your uncle...

507
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.100
so I'm gonna go with you.

508
00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:12.200
Yay!

509
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:21.667
Hey.

510
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.166
I need more tokens.

511
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.133
Really? I just gave you 30.

512
00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:26.333
They run out quickly.

513
00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:27.500
- Please?
- Your mom's paying me back.

514
00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:28.600
Thank you. Mommy!

515
00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:31.867
Oh. "Mommy"? She hasn't
called me that in years.

516
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.533
She must not hate me
too much today.

517
00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:35.233
Yeah. they can be
like that. huh?

518
00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:37.367
I get to be the cool uncle.
the good cop.

519
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.400
and then Mom comes back
and all bets are off.

520
00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:40.900
- Hey. Tony!
- Hey!

521
00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.333
One of your girlfriends?

522
00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:44.633
Just a friend.

523
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:45.900
You got a lot of friends.

524
00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:47.967
Got a problem
with a healthy social life?

525
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.533
"Healthy"
being the key word.

526
00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:51.400
You don't like me much. do you?

527
00:19:51.533 --> 00:19:52.533
I don't--

528
00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:54.800
I don't really know you.

529
00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:56.700
Why don't you tell me
your best three qualities?

530
00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:58.133
I only get to pick three?

531
00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.066
Hey. Tony!

532
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.800
Hey. Jackie!

533
00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:01.967
Oh. my god.

534
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.800
What? She's one of my students!

535
00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:05.800
A student?
Are you a teacher?

536
00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:07.233
'Cause you don't seem the type.

537
00:20:07.367 --> 00:20:08.400
Voice lessons.

538
00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:11.166
That's who you see coming in
and out of my apartment.

539
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.333
despite what I'm sure
you must've thought of me.

540
00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:14.900
Who says
I think of you at all?

541
00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.066
Here's an idea. though.
How are you at bowling?

542
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.500
Uh. if it were
an Olympic sport.

543
00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:22.533
I'd have the gold.

544
00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:23.567
Really?

545
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.033
Care to put your money
where your mouth is?

546
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.667
If I had any money.
I'd say yes.

547
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.867
How about bragging rights?

548
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.066
That... I'm a pro at.

549
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.467
I can imagine.

550
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.500
Get ready to lose!

551
00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:43.900
Last ball.
Feeling confident?

552
00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.667
Wouldn't want it
to be a gutter ball.

553
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.967
That'd be
an embarrassing way to lose.

554
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.333
I'm not worried.

555
00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:51.100
I've been saving
the big guns for last.

556
00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:56.533
Oh! Yes!

557
00:20:56.667 --> 00:20:58.200
- Oh! It hurts!
- Okay!

558
00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:00.133
So I'm not a mathematician.

559
00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:01.367
but I do believe--
can you check this out?

560
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.033
I think 136 beats 126.

561
00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:05.400
Okay. okay.

562
00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:06.900
I don't want to rub it in.
I'm just--

563
00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:07.967
No! You should.

564
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.200
That's what this is for.
Brag away.

565
00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.467
No. no. no.

566
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.200
Some of us are secure enough
that we don't have to brag.

567
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:13.300
No! You've earned this.

568
00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:14.700
If you don't.
I'll do it for you.

569
00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:16.934
Ladies and gentlemen!
She has beat me!

570
00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:19.967
Ms. Mia Rivera.
with the bowling shoes.

571
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.533
with an all-time high score
of 136!

572
00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:23.467
Okay. you can--

573
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.367
You're done.
you're done. you're done.

574
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.800
That's not
an all-time high score.

575
00:21:25.934 --> 00:21:27.200
Not even close.

576
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:28.200
- Whoo!
- Shh! Stop it.

577
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:29.233
You're making a scene.

578
00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:30.266
Somebody has to.

579
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.233
You should be really proud.

580
00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:33.867
You did that in those shoes.

581
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.233
Get outta here.

582
00:21:35.367 --> 00:21:37.600
So Bella tells me
you're a teacher. too.

583
00:21:37.734 --> 00:21:40.767
I'm a professor. yeah.
at the university.

584
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.133
Oh. "professor." I'm sorry.

585
00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:44.633
I didn't mean to disrespect you
by calling you a mere teacher.

586
00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:45.667
What subject?

587
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.467
Uh. this semester.
it's romantic literature.

588
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.367
with a focus on the classics.

589
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.200
Ah. You know. literature
and music aren't that different.

590
00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:55.300
It's always romance and flowers
or heartbreak and angst.

591
00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:57.066
It's the soundtrack
of our lives.

592
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.300
I love the classics.
That's why I sing the standards.

593
00:21:59.433 --> 00:22:01.333
I used to think I was born
in the wrong era.

594
00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:03.200
When I was a kid.
my mom would say.

595
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.533
"Quiet down. Frankie's singing."
and we would listen.

596
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:08.600
And that music
was the music that spoke to me.

597
00:22:08.734 --> 00:22:10.200
Hey!

598
00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:11.667
You should come
to my show tonight.

599
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.967
Are you asking me on a date?

600
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.867
Of course not.
I wouldn't dare.

601
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Bring your friends.
I'll comp you.

602
00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:18.834
It'll be a free night out.
and you'll get to see

603
00:22:18.967 --> 00:22:20.000
that I'm not the person
you think I am.

604
00:22:20.133 --> 00:22:22.033
- Hmm.
- Bella tells me

605
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:24.367
you don't leave
the apartment much.

606
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.633
She what?

607
00:22:25.767 --> 00:22:26.867
Come on.
don't be such a hermit.

608
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.834
I am not a hermit!

609
00:22:28.967 --> 00:22:30.367
- Mom--
- No!

610
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.333
Okay. Fine.

611
00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:38.000
You can count us in.

612
00:22:38.133 --> 00:22:39.300
Great. It's a date.

613
00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:41.200
Mm-mm.
There's gonna be three of us.

614
00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:42.467
It's a comp.

615
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.166
It's a start.
and I'll take it.

616
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:00.200
This was just delivered.

617
00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.900
- Hmm?
- Who's Larry Underwood?

618
00:23:02.033 --> 00:23:03.700
Oh. that's just
business stuff. hon'.

619
00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:06.033
You can just leave it
right there.

620
00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:08.100
Mom. no. Ew.

621
00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:09.367
Honey.

622
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.033
What is with the schmatte?

623
00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:13.734
Well...
I don't know what to wear!

624
00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:15.233
I haven't been
to a supper club since...

625
00:23:15.367 --> 00:23:16.734
your Dad and I were dating.

626
00:23:16.867 --> 00:23:18.333
You know Nick and Derek--
they're just gonna have

627
00:23:18.467 --> 00:23:19.867
the perfect outfits
for something like this.

628
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.700
You are
a beautiful young woman.

629
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.734
Show an ankle. at least!

630
00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:25.667
So what are you and your dad
doing tonight?

631
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600
- Dinner and a movie.
- PG-13?

632
00:23:27.734 --> 00:23:28.834
Mom! I'll be with Dad.

633
00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:30.867
He's not gonna take me to some
horror film or something.

634
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.333
Don't you trust him?

635
00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:34.734
Ah. I know.
I'm sure it'll be fun

636
00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:37.200
and age-appropriate.

637
00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:38.734
Okay. what about this one?

638
00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:41.033
Ah! Now. this is more like it!

639
00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:42.200
Mom!

640
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:43.700
What. is it too much?

641
00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:44.600
I just have not
worn this in years.

642
00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:45.700
Yes.

643
00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:47.266
Yeah. Maybe you should go back

644
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.367
to the pilgrim outfit
from the first Thanksgiving.

645
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.266
Wait. Mom. is this a date?

646
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.834
No! No.

647
00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:54.967
Well...

648
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.533
Hon'. it's just Nick and Derek
and I going to see

649
00:23:57.667 --> 00:24:00.467
the new neighbor perform.

650
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.633
Okay. Because I don't
have to go to Dad's.

651
00:24:02.767 --> 00:24:03.667
We could stay home.
the three of us. and--

652
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.967
No. No.

653
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.000
You need this time
with your dad.

654
00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:09.133
Listen. at least
you finally look like a lady

655
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:11.567
who's definitely gonna get
a second date.

656
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.734
although it--
technically. I know--

657
00:24:13.867 --> 00:24:15.900
it's not supposed to be a date.

658
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.100
Let your mother live her life.

659
00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:22.600
Okay. okay.
I'll let myself out.

660
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.633
Sofia!

661
00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:26.233
Love is in the air.

662
00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:27.934
Ha! Absolutely.

663
00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.967
And I took care
of everything else.

664
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.300
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

665
00:24:31.433 --> 00:24:32.767
Ah! One of these days.

666
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.900
you are gonna learn
not to doubt me.

667
00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:36.567
Well. we are not there yet.

668
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.734
Trust me!

669
00:24:37.867 --> 00:24:41.500
The emcee always gives Tony
his special requests.

670
00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:44.166
Oh! Let's go get a seat!

671
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.834
I must say.
I love the vibe here.

672
00:24:54.967 --> 00:24:56.800
It's kitschy.
it's Goodfellas-ish.

673
00:24:56.934 --> 00:24:57.967
- don't you think?
- Yeah.

674
00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.000
Mm-hmm!

675
00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:00.667
So. what time
does hottie neighbor go on?

676
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.367
He has a name. Derek.

677
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.500
I know. but that's what
we call him in our house.

678
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:06.000
We do.
We call him "hottie neighbor."

679
00:25:06.133 --> 00:25:07.467
You should give him
a try. Mia.

680
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.734
No way! No.

681
00:25:08.867 --> 00:25:09.633
He's one of these

682
00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:11.300
"women in every port"
kinda guys.

683
00:25:11.433 --> 00:25:12.333
Trust me.

684
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:14.533
The charm is always a cover.

685
00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.800
Do not punish him
for the sins of Casey.

686
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:17.867
I'm not.

687
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.166
I just know his type.

688
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.066
Ladies and gentlemen.
how is everyone this evening?

689
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.066
Oh. yeah. Oh. yes.
We are well.

690
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.533
Welcome to the Manhattan
Supper Club.

691
00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:29.967
We have a special show
for you tonight.

692
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.133
Our headliner is in the house.

693
00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:33.500
Please welcome...

694
00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:35.533
Mr. Tony Romano!

695
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.400
Hey!

696
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.867
Thank you.

697
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.867
Thank you!
Thank you for that warm welcome.

698
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.934
As you know.

699
00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:45.800
tonight is the third Saturday
of the month.

700
00:25:45.934 --> 00:25:47.300
which is...

701
00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:48.300
Request night!

702
00:25:48.433 --> 00:25:49.567
Request night.

703
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.667
I've got a stack
of requests here...

704
00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:54.233
But first. let's go out
to the crowd for a moment.

705
00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:55.333
Shall we?

706
00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:58.400
Good evening... pretty lady.

707
00:25:58.533 --> 00:26:00.467
Oh. good evening.

708
00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:04.066
What's your favorite song?

709
00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.600
Why don't you guess what it is.

710
00:26:06.734 --> 00:26:08.266
and I'll tell you
if you're right?

711
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.567
Ooh! Not gonna to make this
easy on me. huh?

712
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.367
Okay.
That's a lot of pressure.

713
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.433
but I do love a challenge.

714
00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:20.433
Let's see.

715
00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:22.800
I... yeah. You know what?

716
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:24.633
Let me just take
a shot in the dark.

717
00:26:24.767 --> 00:26:26.467
based on my own favorite song.

718
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.300
Let's. let's. uh...
let's see how I do.

719
00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:33.467
This song is for
the lovely lady

720
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.300
in the lovely red dress.

721
00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:39.867
who does not want to give me
even one. small inch.

How would he know that?

729
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.700
- Is he stalking you?
- I--

730
00:27:12.834 --> 00:27:14.433

Doesn't he have
a voice like an angel?

738
00:27:50.567 --> 00:27:52.400
He's not bad.

739
00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:57.967
He's good!

740
00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:01.400
"Very good."

741
00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:04.100
Very good. Yes.
Very good.

742
00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:05.767
Nice.

743
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.233
Very nice.

744
00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:21.000
Thank you for the tickets.

745
00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:23.400
Nick and Derek
had such a good time.

746
00:28:23.533 --> 00:28:25.033
And you?

747
00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:27.400
It was fun.

748
00:28:27.533 --> 00:28:28.867
I also enjoyed it.

749
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.500
Well. I'm glad you came.

750
00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:35.333
O-kay! What are you doing?

751
00:28:35.467 --> 00:28:36.233
What-- hey.

752
00:28:36.367 --> 00:28:37.834
I just... I thought...

753
00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:38.900
You thought?

754
00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:40.567
You should probably do
a little less of that.

755
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.300
I'm so sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

756
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:47.166
Look. Mia. despite what
you think of me.

757
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.333
I like you.

758
00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:50.033
and I want
to get to know you better.

759
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.734
'Kay. Well.
my life is very complicated.

760
00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:56.033
Oh. whose isn't?
Welcome to humanity.

761
00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:57.734
And you're dangerous.

762
00:28:57.867 --> 00:28:59.233
I promise...

763
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:01.133
I'm a good guy.

764
00:29:01.266 --> 00:29:04.266
Would you tell me
if you weren't?

765
00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:09.200
Okay. Let's start as friends.

766
00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:11.767
Hey. you need a cup of flour?
I need an egg?

767
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.900
We just knock on
each other's doors.

768
00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:15.734
Okay? Friends?

769
00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.467
Okay.

770
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.767
Friends.

771
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.066
Frien-- Friends.

772
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.400
- Mm.
- Goodnight. friend.

773
00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:25.133
'Night. friend.

774
00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:31.667
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight.

775
00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:49.266
You know your son
and I know my daughter...

776
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.066
and nothing gets her
out of the house

777
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.734
like a nice slice
of Lindsay's Cheesecake.

778
00:29:55.867 --> 00:29:57.867
That's a woman
after my own heart.

779
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.100
And I taught my Anthony
"never pass up a freebie."

780
00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:02.100
Yeah.

781
00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.900
They are due
for a run-in.

782
00:30:05.033 --> 00:30:06.767
Puts them on the same page.

783
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.633
And the same cheesecake!

784
00:30:22.066 --> 00:30:24.800
Morning. Hi.
Did you have fun?

785
00:30:24.934 --> 00:30:26.900
The best! We saw
that new White Lightning movie

786
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:28.567
and then shared
a tornado sundae.

787
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.533
It was huge.

788
00:30:29.667 --> 00:30:30.734
Huge!

789
00:30:30.867 --> 00:30:32.400
Not a vegetable in sight. huh?

790
00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:35.467
No. it wasn't
that much ice cream.

791
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.867
You should come with us
next time.

792
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.533
Save our stomachs. right?

793
00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:41.533
Um. honey. why don't you
go unpack. okay?

794
00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:43.867
I am going to walk Daddy out.

795
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.233
Love you. Daddy.

796
00:30:45.367 --> 00:30:46.400
All right. peanut!

797
00:30:46.533 --> 00:30:47.600
I'll see you next week.

798
00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:49.767
after I get back
from Cleveland. okay?

799
00:30:54.934 --> 00:30:56.900
You can't keep
saying things like that.

800
00:30:57.033 --> 00:30:58.400
Like what?

801
00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:00.834
Like. "Come with us next time."

802
00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:02.533
You can't get her hopes up.

803
00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:05.633
Well. maybe it's not her hopes
I'm banking on. Mia.

804
00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:08.500
Casey...

805
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.100
I've changed.

806
00:31:12.233 --> 00:31:14.433
What do I do
to prove myself to you?

807
00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:16.133
Nothing.

808
00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:19.266
Come on! It's...

809
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.500
It's just the same conversation.
a different day.

810
00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:23.934
and I can't--
I can't do it anymore.

811
00:31:24.066 --> 00:31:25.400
Casey. you have to stop--

812
00:31:27.133 --> 00:31:28.300
Morning.

813
00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:30.367
- Morning.
- Yup.

814
00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:35.367
All right.

815
00:31:36.934 --> 00:31:38.900
I guess I'll see you
Thursday. then.

816
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.033
I have to leave for Derek's
art show by 7.

817
00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.767
so you have to be here on time.

818
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.000
I'll be here.
Don't worry.

819
00:32:00.667 --> 00:32:02.266
- Oh! Oh--
- Oh!

820
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.667
Oh. my-- Oh...

821
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.934
Nice save!

822
00:32:05.066 --> 00:32:06.734
We have to stop
meeting like this.

823
00:32:06.867 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah. We do.

824
00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:11.066
This was almost
our biggest catastrophe yet.

825
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.367
It's. uh. messy.
but salvageable.

826
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.533
I'll take the messy one.

827
00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:16.433
I'll go get you
one that's intact.

828
00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:19.100
even though you've run into me
now the last two times!

829
00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:20.767
You know.
I'm gonna let you do that.

830
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.333
Okay.

831
00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:24.767
Oh. hey. I was meaning
to ask you. um...

832
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.900
if you're okay.

833
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:27.533
That seemed rough
this morning.

834
00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:28.900
Oh. yeah. you know.

835
00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:30.200
co-parenting--
it's difficult--

836
00:32:30.333 --> 00:32:31.767
but. yeah. we're okay. Thanks.

837
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.033
Well. if you ever need to talk.

838
00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:35.233
That's not me hitting on you.

839
00:32:35.367 --> 00:32:37.567
That's me being a friend.
I can be a really good one.

840
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.734
Well. thanks. friend.

841
00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:40.834
Speaking of friendship.
you know.

842
00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:43.867
my mom taught me
that friends

843
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.200
don't let friends
eat cheesecake alone.

844
00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.934
Because that's just sad.

845
00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:49.734
You know
I have a daughter. right?

846
00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:51.233
Yeah. and where
is she right now?

847
00:32:51.367 --> 00:32:52.533
S...

848
00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:54.233
She's at a slumber party.

849
00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.567
Case rested. Your Honor!

850
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.633
Besides. I think
you haven't seen

851
00:32:56.767 --> 00:32:58.233
the best part of the building
yet. have you?

852
00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:00.900
If you say your apartment.
I swear--

853
00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:01.900
I wouldn't dream of it!

854
00:33:02.033 --> 00:33:03.633
I'm gonna go get you
a clean cheesecake.

855
00:33:03.767 --> 00:33:04.734
then you're coming with me.

856
00:33:04.867 --> 00:33:06.600
Okay...

857
00:33:13.133 --> 00:33:14.433
Well!

858
00:33:14.567 --> 00:33:16.333
This was not
on the apartment tour.

859
00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:17.967
Because they lock it.

860
00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.100
But... I have a key.

861
00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:21.500
because I'm friends
with the super.

862
00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:22.567
Ooh!

863
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.967
I like to I come up here
when I want to think.

864
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.433
which. despite
what you may think.

865
00:33:27.567 --> 00:33:29.633
I do think.
from time to time.

866
00:33:29.767 --> 00:33:31.266
I wish
I could stop thinking.

867
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.333
That's where music
comes in handy.

868
00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:35.967
You can't worry or be sad.
when you're singing.

869
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.734
My dad. when he got sick.
I'd sing to him every night.

870
00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:40.900
and. um...

871
00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:43.900
my mom said that really
helped him get through it.

872
00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.266
It helped all of us. really.

873
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.266
Music is...
like a magical elixir.

874
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.667
Well. you're really
very talented.

875
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.967
You ever thought about putting
out an album or something?

876
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.166
Um... I've recorded some songs. but...

877
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.500
...what I do
isn't exactly mainstream.

878
00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:04.200
And performing
is what I love.

879
00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.567
I love being the soundtrack
to other people's love lives.

880
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.967
Not your own?

881
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.700
My goals
were not "big enough"

882
00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:13.667
for my last girlfriend.

883
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800
so that was the end of that.

884
00:34:14.934 --> 00:34:17.066
Mm. Okay.

885
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.133
So. now.
if you don't let them in.

886
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:20.967
then you can't be disappointed.

887
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.033
It's easier if the relationship
has an expiration date?

888
00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:26.233
Oh! You have me
all figured out?

889
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.400
I think that you are sharing
your gifts. Tony.

890
00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:33.900
As a teacher.

891
00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:35.734
as a performer.

892
00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:37.333
as a son.

893
00:34:37.467 --> 00:34:39.433
and I think that's
a perfectly admirable goal.

894
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.633
What got you interested
in literature?

895
00:34:42.767 --> 00:34:45.133
Nazim Hikmet.

896
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:46.367
Na-whos-a-whatsit?

897
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.166
Nazim Hikmet.

898
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.834
He's a Turkish poet.

899
00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:54.533
He's. you know. not exactly
a household name. but...

900
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:57.533
I read this poem that he wrote.
from prison.

901
00:34:57.667 --> 00:34:58.834
called. "On Living."

902
00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:01.467
I read it in college
and it just...

903
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.800
really spoke to me.

904
00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.734
He just-- he believed

905
00:35:04.867 --> 00:35:07.867
that one must have
an intense commitment to life.

906
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.300
no matter what's thrown at you.

907
00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:11.300
That's a good sentiment.

908
00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:14.834
Yeah.
And easier said than done.

909
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.867
And what happened
between you and your ex.

910
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.900
if you don't mind my asking?

911
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.533
I don't mind.

912
00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:24.734
Um...

913
00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:26.700
it was his drinking.

914
00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:29.433
He. um. well. I would
find out he was drinking

915
00:35:29.567 --> 00:35:31.700
when he was supposedly sober.

916
00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.133
And he lost a job because of it

917
00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:35.667
and we had to sell
our apartment.

918
00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:39.033
That must've been hard.

919
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:41.200
Yeah. I think
it was harder on Rosie.

920
00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:42.433
I mean...

921
00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:44.433
she still thinks
that there's a chance.

922
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.133
Is there?

923
00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:51.900
You gonna finish that?

924
00:35:52.033 --> 00:35:54.066
You really did a number on it.

925
00:35:55.734 --> 00:35:58.233
Well. it's the taste
that counts. right?

926
00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:00.533
And you're right--

927
00:36:00.667 --> 00:36:01.967
no one should eat
cheesecake alone.

928
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.000
No.

929
00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:04.633
Mm.

930
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.767
Thanks for taking me up here.

931
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.200
And for your friendship.

932
00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.100
Any time.

933
00:36:12.233 --> 00:36:14.600
My roof key
is your roof key.

934
00:36:14.734 --> 00:36:17.033
And your cheesecake
is my cheesecake.

935
00:36:28.867 --> 00:36:32.100
Yeah. I got someone at five.
but I can get you in at 6:30?

936
00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:34.000
Yeah. Great. Perfect.

937
00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:35.033
Yeah. okay. I'll see you then.

938
00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:37.266
We'll get you ready
for that audition. okay?

939
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.200
Okay. See you then. Bye.

940
00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:41.233
Tony?

941
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.600
Katie.

942
00:36:44.734 --> 00:36:45.967
Yeah.

943
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.166
It's Katherine now.

944
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.000
No one's called me Katie
in ages.

945
00:36:50.867 --> 00:36:53.767
So. what's it been?
Five years? Six?

946
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.166
Yeah. Something like that.

947
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.200
So. how've you been. Tony?

948
00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:03.333
Great. I've. uh. I've been
performing a bunch.

949
00:37:03.467 --> 00:37:04.567
getting some buzz.

950
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.266
Things are fantastic.

951
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.433
I'm so glad.

952
00:37:07.567 --> 00:37:09.900
It was always your dream
and you're making it happen.

953
00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:11.233
- Yeah.
- Okay. bud. There's Mommy.

954
00:37:11.367 --> 00:37:14.900
Hi. my angel.
Hi. angel.

955
00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:16.433
Mark. this is Tony.

956
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.400
How you doing?

957
00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:20.600
This is my husband. Mark.
and this is Lee.

958
00:37:20.734 --> 00:37:23.066
Named after your grandfather.

959
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.000
How'd you know that?

960
00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:27.266
Uh. this is Tony.

961
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.233
- Tony?
- Tony.

962
00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:31.767
Oh! Tony...

963
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.166
He's beautiful. Katie.

964
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.166
Sorry. Katherine.

965
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.934
Guess... kids were
in your future. after all.

966
00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.734
Yeah. You know...

967
00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:46.266
life takes you
in strange directions and...

968
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.000
you never know.

969
00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:49.333
Certainly does.

970
00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.867
Anyway. hon'. we should run.

971
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.700
We've got my thing.

972
00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:53.867
Mark's a lawyer.

973
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.367
He's having a launch party
for his new firm tonight.

974
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.100
It was great seeing you.

975
00:37:58.233 --> 00:37:59.266
All right. Music Man.

976
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.800
Well. good luck with
your little singing and dancing.

977
00:38:01.934 --> 00:38:03.834
We'll see you around.
Come on. buddy.

978
00:38:03.967 --> 00:38:06.133
Mark. was that really necessary?

979
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.400
She always said
she didn't want kids.

980
00:38:17.533 --> 00:38:20.066
and I still almost put a ring
on her finger.

981
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.834
She just didn't want
to have kids with me.

982
00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:24.767
Don't you put this on you.
This is about Katie.

983
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.734
Please. sir. "Katherine."

984
00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:28.433
Sorry. "Katherine."

985
00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:29.900
She wasn't good enough
for you.

986
00:38:30.033 --> 00:38:31.433
and the irony is.

987
00:38:31.567 --> 00:38:32.834
she made it seem like
it was the other way around.

988
00:38:32.967 --> 00:38:33.800
That's the worst part!

989
00:38:33.934 --> 00:38:35.934
I felt that way
our entire relationship.

990
00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:36.800
and I still stayed.

991
00:38:36.934 --> 00:38:39.300
So you learn from it
and move on.

992
00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:41.667
Don't let her be the reason
you miss out on something great.

993
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.667
I don't know. man.

994
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.333
I think. um...

995
00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.800
some people
are meant to be in love

996
00:38:46.934 --> 00:38:49.100
and others are just meant
to sing about it.

997
00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:53.066
On me. my friend.

998
00:39:06.667 --> 00:39:08.500
Okay. Rosie!

999
00:39:08.633 --> 00:39:10.633
Your dad's gonna be here
in five minutes.

1000
00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:12.400
I'm ready.
And I promise I'll keep it

1001
00:39:12.533 --> 00:39:13.867
to one scoop of ice cream tonight.

1002
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.533
Hey. it's your stomach.

1003
00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:16.734
What?

1004
00:39:16.867 --> 00:39:19.000
You're not gonna give me
a bunch of rules before I leave?

1005
00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:21.133
No. You know the drill.

1006
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.000
Hey. Casey.
You running late?

1007
00:39:25.133 --> 00:39:27.300
I'm sorry.
I can't take Rosie tonight.

1008
00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:28.633
I have to work.

1009
00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:29.767
Okay.

1010
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.300
You're telling me this now?
Five minutes before

1011
00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:33.700
you're supposed to pick her up.
when you know I have plans?

1012
00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:35.333
It couldn't be helped. Mia.

1013
00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:37.333
I'm the new guy here.
I'm trying to prove myself.

1014
00:39:37.467 --> 00:39:40.300
I get that. but...

1015
00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:43.200
can you just-- just let me know
a little sooner next time?

1016
00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:45.200
I'll do my very best.

1017
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.166
Uh... okay.

1018
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.700
Change of plans.

1019
00:39:51.834 --> 00:39:54.200
Daddy has to work late.

1020
00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:56.734
so I-I'm just gonna
cancel the art show.

1021
00:39:56.867 --> 00:39:59.066
This wouldn't happen
if we moved back in with him.

1022
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.734
Rosie. can we not do this
right now. please?

1023
00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:03.166
Look around you.

1024
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.333
We have this beautiful new home.

1025
00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:06.867
It's a fresh start
for both of us.

1026
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.667
I didn't need a fresh start.

1027
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.867
Isabella invited me

1028
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.133
across the hall
to watch a movie tonight.

1029
00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.000
but I was going to Dad's.

1030
00:40:14.133 --> 00:40:15.700
Maybe I can still
go over there.

1031
00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:17.200
Okay.

1032
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.533
Yeah. I can ask Tony.
if you want.

1033
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.233
I want.

1034
00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:24.233
All right.
Let's go. Thank you.

1035
00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:31.467
Hello. friend!

1036
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.133
Hi. friend.

1037
00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:36.533
Um. I've got a really big
"friend" favor to ask you.

1038
00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.033
Uh. tonight's
Derek's art show--

1039
00:40:38.166 --> 00:40:39.467
And you want me
to be your date?

1040
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.400
I'm sorry. I already have plans
with Bella.

1041
00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:43.900
Raincheck. though?

1042
00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.133
Mm. No. sorry.

1043
00:40:45.266 --> 00:40:47.834
Casey has to work late
and I cannot leave Rosie alone.

1044
00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:49.533
and this is so important
to Derek.

1045
00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:51.467
Say no more.
We're doing popcorn.

1046
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.233
movie. candy--
the whole nine yards.

1047
00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:54.233
Come on in.

1048
00:40:54.367 --> 00:40:56.333
All right. Have fun!

1049
00:40:56.467 --> 00:40:57.333
Hey. how's it going?

1050
00:40:58.467 --> 00:41:01.100
This won't happen when
my parents get back together.

1051
00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:02.767
At least we can hang.

1052
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.633
Thank you so much.
I owe you big-time.

1053
00:41:05.767 --> 00:41:06.800
You really do.

1054
00:41:06.934 --> 00:41:08.266
and I'm gonna call in
that raincheck soon enough.

1055
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.567
so you keep your phone on.

1056
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.467
- Okay.
- Not "silent"-- on!

1057
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.567
Okay.

1058
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.567
Ladies... I've got an idea.

1059
00:41:22.934 --> 00:41:25.200
Do you remember
how mad you were

1060
00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:26.934
when he quit his job
to paint?

1061
00:41:27.066 --> 00:41:28.533
"Mad" is a little generous.

1062
00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:30.300
Yeah. I had to talk you off
quite a few ledges.

1063
00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:32.100
But look at him now!

1064
00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:33.867
It was a growth moment for me.

1065
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.367
I mean. what's the point
of doing something

1066
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.300
if it makes you miserable?

1067
00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:38.533
And insurance
made him insufferable.

1068
00:41:38.667 --> 00:41:40.133
Look. He made all this.

1069
00:41:40.266 --> 00:41:43.300
Mm. There's a lot to be said
for passion. isn't there?

1070
00:41:43.433 --> 00:41:44.700
Yeah.

1071
00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:46.100
I wish I knew
where mine was hiding.

1072
00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:48.633
I can tell you.
Casey destroyed it.

1073
00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.266
Now he's punishing me.

1074
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.600
He canceled last minute.

1075
00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:53.233
even though. believe me.

1076
00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:55.066
I know he knew hours before
he had to work late.

1077
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.033
- Aw. shoot.
- I had to get Tony

1078
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.533
to watch Rosie tonight.

1079
00:41:57.667 --> 00:41:59.233
Wait a second.
Hottie neighbor?

1080
00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:02.133
- Yes. That is his full name.
- Okay...

1081
00:42:02.266 --> 00:42:04.100
I just sold those two.

1082
00:42:04.233 --> 00:42:05.500
Oh!

1083
00:42:05.633 --> 00:42:07.700
Looks like our anniversary trip
to Aruba is on!

1084
00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:10.166
Fantastic!
Pina coladas. please!

1085
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.667
Here's something fun--

1086
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.367
the neighbor's
watching Rosie tonight.

1087
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.667
Stop it! I love it.

1088
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.266
Mm-hmm!
Mia. I'm telling you.

1089
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.433
if you want to rekindle
that passion.

1090
00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:21.500
I'd check to see if maybe
it's hiding across the hall.

1091
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:24.233
Yeah. I'm gonna check to see
these paintings over here.

1092
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.867
Honey. you can't afford them.

1093
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.834
Oh! Burn. Burn!

1094
00:42:28.967 --> 00:42:30.333
Parker and Robbie. Oh. my gosh.

1095
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.500
Parker. Parker. Parker!

1096
00:42:38.633 --> 00:42:40.367
Ah. Ma'am. you're just in time.

1097
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.433
Please. Come in.

1098
00:42:41.567 --> 00:42:43.834
We've reserved a special seat
just for you.

1099
00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:45.800
Follow me.
Can I take your coat?

1100
00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:47.300
Um... where's Rosie?

1101
00:42:47.433 --> 00:42:48.867
"Rosie"? I ha--

1102
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.700
we don't have anybody
by that name here.

1103
00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:52.700
All I've got backstage
are the rest of The Rat Pack.

1104
00:42:52.834 --> 00:42:54.800
Oh. so Sammy and Dean-o?

1105
00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:56.467
Eh. some lesser-known members.

1106
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.300
Ahem-ahem. ahem!

1107
00:42:58.433 --> 00:43:00.967
Ladies and...

1108
00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:03.433
Lady.

1109
00:43:05.033 --> 00:43:08.700
We are here tonight
to celebrate New York City--

1110
00:43:08.834 --> 00:43:11.867
that magical town that has
brought us all here together

1111
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.834
on this magical night!

1112
00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:15.266
Cue music!

1113
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.900

Oh! Yay!

1141
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.467
Bravo! Fantastic!

1142
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.633
You guys are amazing.

1143
00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.500
All right.
go get out of costume. okay?

1144
00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:52.333
Worth every penny
you're not paying me?

1145
00:44:52.467 --> 00:44:53.633
Even more!

1146
00:44:53.767 --> 00:44:56.233
Ah. then maybe you should take
me out for drinks tomorrow.

1147
00:44:56.367 --> 00:44:57.934
Hey. I know a great place?

1148
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.066
Okay.

1149
00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:03.467
Okay?

1150
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.166
Okay.

1151
00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:08.567
Okay.

1152
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.967
Thanks. Tony.

1153
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.834
- Thank you. Well done.
- Thanks. Tony.

1154
00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:13.400
You're welcome. Goodnight.

1155
00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:39.667
All I know is.
since I met her.

1156
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.266
the Francescas of this world

1157
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.367
don't seem
all that intriguing anymore.

1158
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.800
I like this Mia.

1159
00:45:44.934 --> 00:45:46.467
I do. too.

1160
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.266
Except her ex-husband. Casey.
he's always around.

1161
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.834
And he's such a suit.

1162
00:45:50.967 --> 00:45:52.600
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

1163
00:45:52.734 --> 00:45:54.967
You don't have to compete
with anyone. Anthony.

1164
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.633
All you have to do is sing.

1165
00:45:57.767 --> 00:45:59.867
Yeah. Battle scars. you know?

1166
00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:04.200
You always told me Katie--
I'm sorry. "Katherine"--

1167
00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:05.266
was no good for me.
Did I listen?

1168
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.600
No. you did not.

1169
00:46:06.734 --> 00:46:08.066
No. I did not.

1170
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.767
I know that there's love
out there for you.

1171
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.834
and maybe it's Mia.
maybe it's someone else.

1172
00:46:12.967 --> 00:46:14.367
But when it comes your way.

1173
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.600
you need to be open to it.

1174
00:46:16.734 --> 00:46:19.200
I don't know
about anything anymore.

1175
00:46:19.333 --> 00:46:21.166
Except the stage.

1176
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.700
When I'm up there. singing.
nothing else matters.

1177
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:24.834
Ah. I know.

1178
00:46:24.967 --> 00:46:28.367
And believe you me.
you just follow your heart.

1179
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.166
and everything's gonna work out.

1180
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.300
I know!

1181
00:46:42.834 --> 00:46:44.266
And then
I climbed in the window.

1182
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.266
and my dad
was waiting there for me.

1183
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.233
with a flashlight.

1184
00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:49.066
He had this terrified look
on his face.

1185
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.000
Oh. my dad had
one of those faces. too.

1186
00:46:51.133 --> 00:46:53.433
I had a Mexican dad
and a Jewish mother.

1187
00:46:53.567 --> 00:46:55.266
so. growing up.
I got all the spicy

1188
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.266
and all the guilt.

1189
00:46:57.467 --> 00:46:58.433
Jack! Jack. Mia.

1190
00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:01.333
This is
my very best friend. Jack.

1191
00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:02.767
We were in a band together.
once upon a time.

1192
00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.734
- Oh!
- And I retired

1193
00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:06.834
at the ripe old age of 25.
when I inherited this place.

1194
00:47:06.967 --> 00:47:07.900
- Oh.
- Also...

1195
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:09.333
I didn't have his talent.

1196
00:47:09.467 --> 00:47:11.767
Oh. I'm sure that's not true.

1197
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.133
It's really nice
to meet you. Jack.

1198
00:47:13.266 --> 00:47:15.000
- Likewise. Enjoy.
- Thanks. man.

1199
00:47:15.133 --> 00:47:16.734
Tony Romano!

1200
00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.300
- Hello?
- Hi!

1201
00:47:18.433 --> 00:47:19.767
Don't worry. you don't know me.
I'm Gabrielle.

1202
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.567
I've been to your show
a bunch of times.

1203
00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.667
Oh. thank you.

1204
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.834
So last year.
I was going through

1205
00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:24.834
kind of a bad break-up--

1206
00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.133
like. really bad.
um. catastrophic. even.

1207
00:47:27.266 --> 00:47:28.500
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

1208
00:47:28.633 --> 00:47:30.000
My ex. Jeff--

1209
00:47:30.133 --> 00:47:32.233
I mean-- Oof!
I mean. he was not good.

1210
00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:34.400
This one time. he was on a date
with me and another girl

1211
00:47:34.533 --> 00:47:35.567
at the same time!

1212
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.500
Oof. That sounds--
What a...

1213
00:47:37.633 --> 00:47:38.834
- Anyway--
- Oh. Sure.

1214
00:47:38.967 --> 00:47:41.400
Yeah. your show was the thing
that got me out of the house.

1215
00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:42.467
There's just something
about your music

1216
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600
that makes you feel hopeful.

1217
00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:45.500
You know.
I could not agree more.

1218
00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.066
Yeah.

1219
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.734
Well. hey. if I keep singing.
will you keep coming back?

1220
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.900
Ah! Deal! Selfie?
For my blog.

1221
00:47:52.033 --> 00:47:52.900
Absolu-- No prob--

1222
00:47:53.033 --> 00:47:54.166
Oka--

1223
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.333
Yeah!

1224
00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:57.233
You got it. All right.

1225
00:47:57.367 --> 00:47:59.000
Do not let this one get away.

1226
00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:00.700
Yep.

1227
00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.533
Babe! I just met Tony Romano!

1228
00:48:04.533 --> 00:48:06.533
I swear. I did not
put her up to that.

1229
00:48:06.667 --> 00:48:09.367
You sure you didn't
slip her a 20 or something?

1230
00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:11.734
I gotta say. though...

1231
00:48:11.867 --> 00:48:13.967
moments like that
make it all worthwhile.

1232
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.200
Yeah.

1233
00:48:15.333 --> 00:48:17.200
You know.
that picture for her blog

1234
00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:18.200
is just to make
Jeff jealous. right?

1235
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:19.900
Hashtag "JealousJeff."

1236
00:48:20.033 --> 00:48:21.667
Ooh! Nice.

1237
00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:32.900
Well. I had a really nice time
with you tonight. Tony.

1238
00:48:33.033 --> 00:48:35.233
Thank you
for giving me a chance.

1239
00:48:35.367 --> 00:48:39.066
Yeah. You know. you're not
who I thought you were.

1240
00:48:40.467 --> 00:48:41.900
Is that a good thing?

1241
00:48:42.033 --> 00:48:45.166
You know. I think
it just might be.

1242
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.867
I thought
I heard something out here.

1243
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.200
Uh... Casey.

1244
00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:56.567
What are you doing here?

1245
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.333
Rosie was supposed
to stay with you tonight.

1246
00:48:58.467 --> 00:49:01.867
Yeah. yeah. Seems like
you weren't expecting me.

1247
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.467
I have to go to Miami tomorrow.
last minute.

1248
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.800
so I dropped Rosie off early.

1249
00:49:08.066 --> 00:49:10.000
Um...

1250
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.600
I'll be in in a minute.

1251
00:49:12.734 --> 00:49:13.934
Just give me a second. okay?

1252
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.200
Y-- Sure. Gladly.

1253
00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:19.266
'Kay.

1254
00:49:23.667 --> 00:49:24.734
I'm sorry about that.

1255
00:49:24.867 --> 00:49:26.300
Look. Look. dating is tricky.

1256
00:49:26.433 --> 00:49:27.934
You walk into
the middle of someone's life.

1257
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:30.100
you can't expect them
not to have one.

1258
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.066
I really did have
a good time with you tonight.

1259
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.033
Goodnight. Mia.

1260
00:49:39.166 --> 00:49:41.066
Goodnight. Tony.

1261
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.500
Hey. Who's he?

1262
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:03.767
You sure you got
enough balloons there?

1263
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.934
Hey! We have a very important
birthday to celebrate.

1264
00:50:07.066 --> 00:50:08.967
so we're taking
our show on the road.

1265
00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.200
You want to come?

1266
00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:11.200
The more the merrier.

1267
00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:12.567
and this party
could use some more merry.

1268
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.567
Can we. please. Mom?

1269
00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.767
We can have breakfast after.

1270
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.133
Anything to stop you
from cooking.

1271
00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:18.100
Hey! Um...

1272
00:50:18.233 --> 00:50:20.300
Okay. Sure.
I could do for a celebration.

1273
00:50:20.433 --> 00:50:21.300
Great.

1274
00:50:21.433 --> 00:50:22.700
I can't wait
for you to meet Uncle Harry.

1275
00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:25.200
Ladies first.

1276
00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:26.967
Who's Uncle Harry?

1277
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.633
Don't tell me
he's still sleeping.

1278
00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:42.367
Uh. no. he knows
exactly what we are up to

1279
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.900
and he's just avoiding it
as long as possible.

1280
00:50:45.033 --> 00:50:46.367
That sounds like Uncle Harry.

1281
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.300
But all will be forgiven!

1282
00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:50.533
I'm going to take Rosie
over to meet Natalie.

1283
00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:51.900
She has the best stories.

1284
00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:53.734
She even used to date Elvis.

1285
00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.400
Oh! Well. who among us
has not. right?

1286
00:50:56.667 --> 00:50:58.367
Sheila. this is my friend.

1287
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.667
and. today.
my music supervisor. Mia.

1288
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.967
Oh. hi. Mia.

1289
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.767
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1290
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.867
I'm the social director here.

1291
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.834
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1292
00:51:05.967 --> 00:51:07.100
I'm going to check on
the microphone.

1293
00:51:07.233 --> 00:51:08.700
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

1294
00:51:08.834 --> 00:51:09.800
He is a peach.

1295
00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:11.500
Oh. he comes every weekend

1296
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:13.467
to see his uncle
and sing to the residents.

1297
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.033
Boy. do they ever
look forward to that.

1298
00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:16.367
Every weekend?

1299
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.867
Yeah. They love him.
Everybody loves Tony.

1300
00:51:20.133 --> 00:51:21.633
But he's never
brought a date before.

1301
00:51:21.767 --> 00:51:22.867
You must be pretty special.

1302
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.467
Oh. I-I'm not a date.
I'm just a friend.

1303
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.500
Oh. trust me.
He thinks it's a date.

1304
00:51:29.633 --> 00:51:31.367
Oh. I think he's coming.
Okay. everybody!

1305
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.767
Okay. guys. on "one"
we're gonna say "Surprise!"

1306
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.266
Three.

1307
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.633
two. one!

1308
00:51:36.767 --> 00:51:38.700
Surprise!

1309
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:41.667
Don't do that to a guy my age!

1310
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.533
The ticker ain't
what it used to be.

1311
00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:45.600
Happy birthday. Uncle Harry!

1312
00:51:45.734 --> 00:51:48.166
Oh. we're so thrilled
to be celebrating you today--

1313
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.266
the man. the legend--

1314
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.266
the man who once punched
a black bear in the face.

1315
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.367
Yeah. but he didn't bother me
anymore. that's for sure.

1316
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.533
Yeah. no one messes
with Uncle Harry.

1317
00:51:58.667 --> 00:52:01.600
And now... I'm gonna sing
your favorite song.

1318
00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:02.900
Lady Gaga?

1319
00:52:03.033 --> 00:52:04.033
No!

1320
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:06.333
Aw. can't get enough Gaga.

1321
00:52:06.467 --> 00:52:07.700

Mom. what are you doing?

1366
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.900
I'm trying something new.

1367
00:55:05.033 --> 00:55:06.266
Buckwheat pancakes.

1368
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.900
Nick gave me the recipe.

1369
00:55:08.033 --> 00:55:10.367
Whatever happened
to just plain old cereal?

1370
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.000
Well. this is more... fun.

1371
00:55:13.133 --> 00:55:15.166
Maybe for you.

1372
00:55:16.567 --> 00:55:17.867
Yeah. Oh!

1373
00:55:18.967 --> 00:55:20.166
So. um...

1374
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.867
yesterday was fun. right?

1375
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.934
I think Uncle Harry
had a good time.

1376
00:55:25.066 --> 00:55:26.667
You seemed to have
a great time.

1377
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.934
Yeah. We all did.

1378
00:55:30.066 --> 00:55:31.934
Yeah. but...

1379
00:55:32.066 --> 00:55:35.433
I just wish things could
go back to the way they were.

1380
00:55:35.567 --> 00:55:36.734
Honey.

1381
00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:38.600
Listen...

1382
00:55:38.734 --> 00:55:40.934
Daddy and I love you
so much. okay?

1383
00:55:41.066 --> 00:55:42.400
That's never. ever
gonna change.

1384
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.834
But sometimes...

1385
00:55:45.967 --> 00:55:49.367
things just don't work out.
no matter how hard you try.

1386
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.200
But you seem happier now
than before.

1387
00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:56.734
I am.

1388
00:55:56.867 --> 00:56:00.567
And that's because
I'm working really hard at it.

1389
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.100
for the both of us.

1390
00:56:03.233 --> 00:56:05.300
You know.
my Bubbie used to say

1391
00:56:05.433 --> 00:56:07.567
that smiling
is good for the soul.

1392
00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.266
and I think we could both use
some more smiles.

1393
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.200
'Kay?

1394
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.233
Good evening.

1395
00:56:21.367 --> 00:56:22.300
Full moon tonight.

1396
00:56:22.433 --> 00:56:24.100
And?
Do you turn into a werewolf?

1397
00:56:24.233 --> 00:56:25.066
Should I lock my doors?

1398
00:56:26.266 --> 00:56:28.900
Uh. not yet.
so I think you're in the clear.

1399
00:56:29.033 --> 00:56:31.133
But it's really quite a show.

1400
00:56:31.266 --> 00:56:32.900
You wanna meet at our spot?

1401
00:56:33.033 --> 00:56:34.767
I don't have a key.

1402
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.133
It's okay. I know a guy.

1403
00:56:37.266 --> 00:56:38.633
And I've got something for you.

1404
00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:40.100
Okay.

1405
00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:41.467
I'll meet you in five.

1406
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.667
'Kay.

1407
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.266
Hey.

1408
00:57:01.433 --> 00:57:02.967
You doing okay?

1409
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.633
Do you got any new hair or--

1410
00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:06.800
- All clear. All clear so far.
- ...or fangs?

1411
00:57:06.934 --> 00:57:08.200
- Okay.
- I got you something.

1412
00:57:08.333 --> 00:57:09.734
- What is this?
- A little gift.

1413
00:57:09.867 --> 00:57:12.000
I was walking by
a bookstore today

1414
00:57:12.133 --> 00:57:13.333
and I thought of you.

1415
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.700
When Katie dumped me.

1416
00:57:16.834 --> 00:57:18.734
it knocked me down pretty hard.

1417
00:57:18.867 --> 00:57:19.800
When someone tells you
enough times.

1418
00:57:19.934 --> 00:57:20.867
"you're not good enough."

1419
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.333
you start to believe them.

1420
00:57:22.467 --> 00:57:24.834
Couldn't get on a stage
for months.

1421
00:57:24.967 --> 00:57:26.467
Wow. What changed?

1422
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.467
I was waiting
for the subway one day

1423
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.967
and these three kids

1424
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.066
started singing
one of my favorite songs--

1425
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.867
beautiful harmonies--

1426
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.400
and it just...

1427
00:57:38.533 --> 00:57:39.900
...woke me up.

1428
00:57:40.033 --> 00:57:42.433
What was the song?

1429
00:57:43.633 --> 00:57:46.867
♪ Fly me to the moon ♪

1430
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.633
♪ And let me play
Among the stars ♪

1431
00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:53.700
♪ Let me see
What spring is like ♪

1432
00:57:53.834 --> 00:57:56.533
♪ On Jupiter and Mars ♪

1433
00:57:56.667 --> 00:57:58.166
- You've heard of it?
- Yeah.

1434
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.300
Sometimes. you just need to be
re-ignited by your passion

1435
00:58:01.433 --> 00:58:03.367
in order to wake up.

1436
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.266
Thank you.

1437
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.767
This--
This is exactly what I needed.

1438
00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.433
Exactly?

1439
00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:14.467
And you are enough. Tony.

1440
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.100
Don't ever let anyone
ever tell you otherwise.

1441
00:58:19.033 --> 00:58:21.033
♪ In other words ♪

1442
00:58:21.166 --> 00:58:24.133
♪ Hold my hand ♪

1443
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.867
♪ In other words ♪

1444
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.500
♪ Baby. kiss me ♪

1445
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.433
♪ Fill my heart with song
and let me sing for-- ♪

1446
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.533
Not tonight.

1447
00:59:25.967 --> 00:59:27.667
So how many of you
are familiar with

1448
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.467
"Hope is the Thing
With Feathers"

1449
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.133
by Emily Dickinson?

1450
00:59:31.266 --> 00:59:33.533
Okay. Quite a number of you.
Great!

1451
00:59:33.667 --> 00:59:36.767
Well. today. I want to focus
on the thematic power

1452
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.033
of hope in poetry.

1453
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.166
"Hope is the thing
with feathers--

1454
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.367
it perches in the soul.

1455
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.433
it sings the tune
without the words.

1456
00:59:47.567 --> 00:59:49.600
it never stops...

1457
00:59:49.734 --> 00:59:50.734
at all."

1458
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.667
What's she saying?

1459
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.633
Yeah?

1460
00:59:55.767 --> 00:59:57.266
Hope is miraculous

1461
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.500
and it never asks
for anything in return.

1462
00:59:59.633 --> 01:00:00.533
Exactly.

1463
01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:03.767
I mean. it costs us nothing
to have hope.

1464
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.767
Right? Yeah. what else?

1465
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.734
Uh-huh?

1466
01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:09.367
Like a bird.
we must let hope fly free.

1467
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.166
Yes. Yes!

1468
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.033
And the imagery
that Dickinson uses

1469
01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:15.467
is just so powerful.

1470
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.200
I mean. you can feel it
as you're reading this.

1471
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:20.800
Yep. She's definitely
seeing someone.

1472
01:00:20.934 --> 01:00:22.767
Oh. for sure!

1473
01:00:30.467 --> 01:00:31.734
Hey. Tony.

1474
01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:33.100
♪ Fill my heart with song ♪

1475
01:00:33.233 --> 01:00:35.533
♪ And let me sing
Forevermore ♪

1476
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.700
Someone is in a good mood.

1477
01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.433
When words fail.
music speaks.

1478
01:00:39.567 --> 01:00:41.367
Oh. and poetry. too.

1479
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.900
To what do I owe
this delightful mood?

1480
01:00:44.033 --> 01:00:45.066
To new beginnings. my friend.

1481
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.033
That's what I like to see.

1482
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.600
The old Tony's back. huh?

1483
01:00:48.734 --> 01:00:50.033
I like her. Jack.

1484
01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:52.400
She lets me be me.

1485
01:00:52.533 --> 01:00:54.266
See? Now Katie was an outlier.

1486
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.700
She's the exception.
not the rule.

1487
01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.533
But what if Mia
wakes up one day

1488
01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.567
and decides she wants some guy
with a stable nine-to-five job?

1489
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.567
If that's all she cares about.
she's not the one for you.

1490
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.600
- Yup.
- Yeah.

1491
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.433
♪ You are all I long for ♪

1492
01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:14.934
♪ All I worship and adore ♪

1493
01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:16.900
Okay. okay-kay-kay-kay.

1494
01:01:17.033 --> 01:01:18.166
Who's got you sounding so giddy

1495
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.266
and why do you constantly say no
to coming to karaoke night

1496
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.433
when you can sing like that?

1497
01:01:22.533 --> 01:01:23.767
He kissed me.

1498
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.100
Tony?

1499
01:01:25.233 --> 01:01:26.734
Okay. no. stop. stop.

1500
01:01:26.867 --> 01:01:28.500
You come here right now.
Spill the tea. girl.

1501
01:01:28.633 --> 01:01:29.734
Okay. I'm seeing him tonight.

1502
01:01:29.867 --> 01:01:31.633
and... I don't know.

1503
01:01:31.767 --> 01:01:34.133
I feel like
maybe I can trust him.

1504
01:01:34.266 --> 01:01:35.233
He gets me.

1505
01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:37.467
and it's been so long
since I've felt this way.

1506
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.166
and I... I don't know.
Am I an idiot?

1507
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.333
For trusting a guy?

1508
01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:42.967
Yeah. probably. But then.
I never would've met Derek

1509
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.967
if I'd stayed in my cocoon
after breaking up

1510
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.433
with that evil-evil-evil
troll of a man

1511
01:01:47.567 --> 01:01:48.600
whose name we don't mention.

1512
01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:51.100
And look at you. you emerged
a beautiful butterfly.

1513
01:01:51.233 --> 01:01:53.567
Aww. Yeah. So can you.

1514
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.100
- Hmph.
- What?

1515
01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.133
What if I get
all the way in this.

1516
01:01:57.266 --> 01:01:59.633
and then he's not
who I thought he was?

1517
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.233
The past is not a prologue.

1518
01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:03.533
He isn't Casey!

1519
01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:05.667
You got to dive in feet-first
when it comes to this stuff.

1520
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.633
or you'll never know.

1521
01:02:06.767 --> 01:02:08.000
Head-first.

1522
01:02:08.133 --> 01:02:10.066
- What?
- You dive head-first.

1523
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.333
Who swims?

1524
01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:42.867
Heavy or light?

1525
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.967
Uh. the food
or the conversation?

1526
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.333
Food. then conversation.

1527
01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:46.433
Then I'm fine with either.

1528
01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:48.667
as long as we get
this house-special carbonara.

1529
01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.900
Then we are going way heavy.

1530
01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:51.033
Yeah.

1531
01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:51.967
That was my Nonna's favorite.

1532
01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.367
You know. it was
at this very restaurant.

1533
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.533
she taught me
not to spill the salt.

1534
01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.233
Okay. so what
is that all about?

1535
01:02:58.367 --> 01:02:59.166
It's believed.
you spill the salt.

1536
01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.533
evil spirits
start to lurk behind you.

1537
01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:02.934
so you throw the salt
over your shoulder.

1538
01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.800
hits them in the face.
they go away.

1539
01:03:04.934 --> 01:03:05.934
Makes perfect sense.

1540
01:03:06.066 --> 01:03:08.300
Wow. Your Nonna sounds like
quite the character.

1541
01:03:08.433 --> 01:03:10.700
She believed all that stuff--
omens. superstitions.

1542
01:03:10.834 --> 01:03:13.567
that your dreams
are messages about the future.

1543
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.100
Mm. God. I hope not.

1544
01:03:15.233 --> 01:03:16.166
I had one last night

1545
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.734
that Casey got Rosie a cobra
for her birthday.

1546
01:03:18.867 --> 01:03:20.033
Let's hope
they don't all come true.

1547
01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:20.934
Yeah.

1548
01:03:22.834 --> 01:03:24.400
I don't like to tempt fate.

1549
01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.233
You know. I don't. um...

1550
01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.066
I don't have
the best track record

1551
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.233
when it comes to love.

1552
01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:31.066
Yeah. Welcome to the club.

1553
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.367
which I am
definitely a part of.

1554
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.900
Oh. come on. We have to have
some good stories

1555
01:03:36.033 --> 01:03:37.734
of love and luck
in our past.

1556
01:03:37.867 --> 01:03:39.266
No.

1557
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400
Tell me about your first kiss.

1558
01:03:40.533 --> 01:03:42.066
Oh. that was Hebrew school.

1559
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.400
Jared Mendelbaum.

1560
01:03:43.533 --> 01:03:45.867
And he is in prison now.

1561
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.533
Because of the kiss?

1562
01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:48.767
Uh. it was insider trading.

1563
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.567
but the kiss was bad.

1564
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.800
It. uh.
it scared me off another one

1565
01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:56.266
for a few years.

1566
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.934
What about you?

1567
01:03:58.066 --> 01:03:59.467
Also an epic tragedy.

1568
01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.967
I was 15.
we were on a class trip.

1569
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.333
and that's where I met... Gina.

1570
01:04:04.467 --> 01:04:05.600
Oh. Uh-oh.

1571
01:04:05.734 --> 01:04:07.700
We were on a train to DC.

1572
01:04:07.834 --> 01:04:10.133
and I leaned into the kiss.
she kissed me back.

1573
01:04:10.266 --> 01:04:12.433
and then Gina said.

1574
01:04:12.567 --> 01:04:13.800
"I'm out."

1575
01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:14.734
And that was it.

1576
01:04:14.867 --> 01:04:17.000
She walked away.
I never saw her again.

1577
01:04:17.133 --> 01:04:18.367
Wow!

1578
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.767
Well. I gotta say. um.

1579
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.767
you definitely upped your game
since Gina on the train.

1580
01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.333
Maybe it doesn't take
just one kiss.

1581
01:04:28.467 --> 01:04:30.200
but it has to be the right kiss.

1582
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.133
Wait a minute.

1583
01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:34.367
That was you.

1584
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.934
The movie theater?

1585
01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:37.834
You were so mean!

1586
01:04:37.967 --> 01:04:40.033
You wouldn't stop talking.

1587
01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:42.266
Well--
Gosh!

1588
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.567
I mean...

1589
01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:48.533
all these chance encounters
have to mean something. right?

1590
01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:51.467
Maybe the universe
knows something we don't.

1591
01:04:52.633 --> 01:04:55.633
Who are we to tempt fate?

1592
01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:58.300
I'm willing to give it a try...

1593
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.934
...if you are.

1594
01:05:21.567 --> 01:05:23.266
Goodnight. Tony.

1595
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.200
Bella notte.

1596
01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.400
Dream a little dream of me?

1597
01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:38.867
It won't be the first time.

1598
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.433
♪ Life is just a dream ♪

1599
01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:04.900

1600
01:06:05.033 --> 01:06:08.400

1605
01:06:27.467 --> 01:06:31.000
Guess you just weren't enough.

1606
01:07:05.533 --> 01:07:06.734
Good morning.

1607
01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:07.867
Buongiorno.

1608
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.066
I. uh. come bearing gifts.

1609
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.033
Oh.

1610
01:07:10.166 --> 01:07:11.834
The strongest espresso
you've ever had--

1611
01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:13.967
it'll make your hair
stand on end.

1612
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.533
And...

1613
01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:16.900
cannoli.

1614
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.233
For breakfast?

1615
01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:19.567
It's the Italian way.

1616
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.033
Okay!

1617
01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:23.867
Well. I will take that coffee.

1618
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.667
Me too. You. uh.
haunted my dreams last night.

1619
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.066
Oh. I'm sorry.

1620
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.400
Can I offer you
a cannoli as penance?

1621
01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.200
Um. there's
a black-and-white movie marathon

1622
01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:39.400
this weekend.
at the Vogue.

1623
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:42.667
A little. uh. Jimmy Stewart?
A little Barbara Stanwyck?

1624
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.967
You want to...
you want to go with me?

1625
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah. that would be nice.

1626
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.900
Hey!

1627
01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.066
He has a key?

1628
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.867
Yeah. we share a kid.
It just makes things easier.

1629
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.633
Hi! Mm!

1630
01:07:56.767 --> 01:07:57.867
Hi. Tony.

1631
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.667
Hey. Rosie.
Bella and I are going

1632
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.600
to the arcade this weekend.
if you want to come along?

1633
01:08:01.734 --> 01:08:04.066
Yeah. I want a rematch
at Super Shooters.

1634
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.934
I'll give you that rematch.
but I'm still gonna beat you.

1635
01:08:06.066 --> 01:08:08.266
Okay. put your stuff down.

1636
01:08:10.834 --> 01:08:11.967
Cannolis.

1637
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.767
Nice.

1638
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.800
It's real neighborly of you.

1639
01:08:15.934 --> 01:08:17.633
Mom. can you help me
with my zipper?

1640
01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:20.433
Yeah. honey.
Of course. Um...

1641
01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:24.567
Just going to be a minute.

1642
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.533
So.

1643
01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.633
So...

1644
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.967
Rosie's a great kid.

1645
01:08:46.533 --> 01:08:47.967
Look. guy.

1646
01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.166
Mia's my wife.

1647
01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.600
Ex-wife.

1648
01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:54.934
Semantics.

1649
01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.233
This is temporary.

1650
01:09:00.233 --> 01:09:03.500
We're on a break.
but I will be back. okay?

1651
01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:07.300
I just want you to know that.

1652
01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:10.867
Bye. sweetheart.

1653
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.867
Oh. Bye.

1654
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.066
Bye.

1655
01:09:15.166 --> 01:09:16.867
Bye. "guy."

1656
01:09:20.433 --> 01:09:21.667
Where's my coffee?

1657
01:09:23.767 --> 01:09:25.166
He. uh. took it.

1658
01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.700
I can't sleep.
Can I snuggle?

1659
01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:39.166
Yeah. honey. Of course.
Get in here.

1660
01:09:47.567 --> 01:09:49.700
Is everything okay?

1661
01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:53.200
You and Daddy aren't
getting back together. are you?

1662
01:09:53.333 --> 01:09:54.967
No. honey.

1663
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.300
No. we're not.

1664
01:09:58.834 --> 01:10:02.867
I'm sorry. I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

1665
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.000
You know. part of me's
always gonna love him.

1666
01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:09.066
but...

1667
01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.033
...we tell people
how to treat us

1668
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.600
by what
we're willing to tolerate.

1669
01:10:14.734 --> 01:10:17.033
And I just was tired
of being lied to.

1670
01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:19.266
Daddy says he's getting help.

1671
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.133
He is.

1672
01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:23.600
He is.
and I am rooting for him.

1673
01:10:23.734 --> 01:10:26.200
like I have every other time.

1674
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.467
Honey. I tried...

1675
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.033
I really tried.

1676
01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:38.800
I tried with everything
that I have.

1677
01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:41.433
I hope that you know that.

1678
01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:44.367
Neither of us-- neither of us
wanted this to be the outcome.

1679
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.266
I just love you so much.

1680
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.033
I know.

1681
01:10:50.467 --> 01:10:52.467
Do you know
what I know. though?

1682
01:10:53.633 --> 01:10:56.033
It's gonna be okay.

1683
01:10:56.166 --> 01:10:58.400
Promise?

1684
01:11:00.066 --> 01:11:01.800
Promise.

1685
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.867
Hey. neighbor.

1686
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.233
Oh. yeah.

1687
01:11:15.367 --> 01:11:16.867
Yeah. it is
what you think it is. buddy.

1688
01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:20.700
See. I told you I'd be back.

1689
01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:22.100
I meant it.

1690
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:24.600
Hey.

1691
01:11:24.734 --> 01:11:26.300
Have a great day.

1692
01:11:27.467 --> 01:11:29.700
You too.

1693
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.900
Hey.

1694
01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:37.934
Hi.

1695
01:11:38.066 --> 01:11:39.266
How was work?

1696
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.834
It was good.

1697
01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:42.233
What are you doing?

1698
01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:44.433
I am cooking you dinner.

1699
01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.500
Veal Parmigiana.

1700
01:11:46.633 --> 01:11:48.567
It's your favorite.

1701
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.266
Yeah.

1702
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.533
Just wanted to say thank you
for letting me stay here

1703
01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:53.567
while they get my place ready.

1704
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.934
Well. I'm doing this
for Rosie.

1705
01:11:56.066 --> 01:11:57.367
and...

1706
01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.934
you're staying on the couch.

1707
01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:00.767
Understood.

1708
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.934
Okay.

1709
01:12:04.066 --> 01:12:05.166
Hey.

1710
01:12:06.867 --> 01:12:09.266
What about dinner?

1711
01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:11.834
Enjoy the veal.

1712
01:12:21.567 --> 01:12:24.100
So what book do you want to get
at the library?

1713
01:12:24.233 --> 01:12:26.400
Oh. hey. can you run on ahead?

1714
01:12:26.533 --> 01:12:27.567
I'll meet up with you in a sec.

1715
01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.600
Hi. Tony.

1716
01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:31.166
Hi. I'm glad I ran into you.

1717
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.400
I just-- I know we need
to talk about that.

1718
01:12:33.533 --> 01:12:34.900
Yeah. uh.

1719
01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:36.734
I've. uh. got something
right now. so...

1720
01:12:36.867 --> 01:12:39.433
uh. uh. this isn't a good time.

1721
01:12:39.567 --> 01:12:42.567
Yeah. but before Friday.
You know. our movie night?

1722
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.633
Yeah. about Friday.
I'm gonna have to cancel.

1723
01:12:44.767 --> 01:12:47.066
Uh... something... came up.

1724
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.166
Oh. Okay. Um...

1725
01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.800
Another time?

1726
01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.166
Yeah. Yeah.

1727
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.800
I-I gotta go.
I'll see you later. Mia.

1728
01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:56.667
Uh... 'kay.

1729
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.266
Tony!

1730
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.934
It's so good to see you!

1731
01:13:00.133 --> 01:13:01.333
Hey! You too!

1732
01:13:03.033 --> 01:13:05.200
I missed you!

1733
01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.967
I just got us breakfast!
Come on up.

1734
01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.200
Perfect.
I'm starving.

1735
01:13:12.767 --> 01:13:13.900
Oy vey.

1736
01:13:14.033 --> 01:13:15.867
Madonna mia.

1737
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.333
Let's go see CATS.

1738
01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:28.834
Oh. gosh.

1739
01:13:28.967 --> 01:13:31.133
I'm calling.
I'm calling. I'm calling.

1740
01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:34.166
What are you talking about?

1741
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.266
Let's just say

1742
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.734
I should've followed my instinct
the first time.

1743
01:13:37.867 --> 01:13:39.700
Oh. my gosh.
I am so sorry. honey.

1744
01:13:39.834 --> 01:13:41.400
Listen.
I didn't like him anyway.

1745
01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:44.166
I mean. I liked him a little.
He's-- He was--

1746
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.133
Do I have to come over there
and have a word with him?

1747
01:13:46.266 --> 01:13:48.533
No. Guys. I'm fine.

1748
01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:49.967
- She says it's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

1749
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.500
Are you sure? Because we can
bring over some wine

1750
01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:53.567
and a Ryan Reynolds
movie tonight--

1751
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.767
Honey! Honey!

1752
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.066
Nobody likes Ryan Reynolds.
You like Ryan Reynolds.

1753
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:56.967
If I have to see

1754
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.467
Just Friends again.
I'm gonna--

1755
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.066
- Right. I'm sorry.
- No Ryan Reynolds.

1756
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.967
Listen. We love you.

1757
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.600
We're here for you.
Mia Mia. we love you.

1758
01:14:04.734 --> 01:14:06.967
Thanks. guys. Love you.

1759
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.033
She loves us.

1760
01:14:08.166 --> 01:14:09.533
- Oh.
- Okay. listen.

1761
01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:12.533
Don't eat your feelings. okay?
Talk soon.

1762
01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:13.600
Barkeep!

1763
01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.433
I've missed you so much.

1764
01:14:22.567 --> 01:14:23.867
I was only gone three weeks.

1765
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.367
Three pivotal weeks.

1766
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.967
Mommy! You're back early!

1767
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.200
Oh! Hello. my love!

1768
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.633
I was able to cut my trip short

1769
01:14:29.767 --> 01:14:31.100
so I could
be back with my family.

1770
01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:34.100
I have so much to tell you.

1771
01:14:34.233 --> 01:14:36.100
Yeah. I can see that
all over your face.

1772
01:14:36.233 --> 01:14:38.300
Tell me everything.

1773
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.567
I know it's request night.

1774
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.834
and. usually. I go through

1775
01:14:43.967 --> 01:14:47.367
this stack of fun. upbeat
standards we all know and love.

1776
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.367
but when a man's heart's been
stomped on mercilessly.

1777
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.533
he wants to sing the blues.

1778
01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:54.033
so tonight.

1779
01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:57.400
I'm sing a song that Frank wrote
about Ava Gardner

1780
01:14:57.533 --> 01:14:59.100
when everything
was falling apart.

1781
01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.834
called.
"I'm A Fool to Want You."

1782
01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:04.500
Not now. Red.

1783
01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.200
But first.
can I get a show of hands.

1784
01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:08.166
for who else thought
that they had found the one

1785
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.266
and then.
in the blink of an eye.

1786
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.500
it was just over.

1787
01:15:10.633 --> 01:15:11.700
done.

1788
01:15:11.834 --> 01:15:13.200
kaput?

1789
01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:15.266
Because
people are not reliable.

1790
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.367
People. who need people.

1791
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.100
aren't the luckiest people
in the world.

1792
01:15:20.233 --> 01:15:21.333
They're suckers!

1793
01:15:21.467 --> 01:15:22.433
Oh. boy.

1794
01:15:22.567 --> 01:15:23.834
This is not going well.

1795
01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:26.200
Yeah. he is very negative.

1796
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.800
I mean. but we did try.
We tried.

1797
01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:30.834
We failed.

1798
01:15:30.967 --> 01:15:31.734
What else can we do?

1799
01:15:31.867 --> 01:15:33.266
I have my daughter. Valeria
at home.

1800
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.567
but you don't have a son.

1801
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.100
What are you talking about?
Because this all went so well?

1802
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.700
So disappointed.

1803
01:15:39.834 --> 01:15:42.934
I had such a cute little outfit
picked out for the wedding.

1804
01:15:43.066 --> 01:15:45.033
Yeah. and I planned
the whole cocktail hour.

1805
01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:48.600
Listen. we have to stay
out of their love lives.

1806
01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:51.133
These two kids have
to figure it out for themselves.

1807
01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:52.300
And when you're right.
you're right.

1808
01:15:52.433 --> 01:15:54.800
All we have left
is a little hope

1809
01:15:54.934 --> 01:15:56.967
and a little prayer.

1810
01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:01.767
I mean. all the great songs
came from great pain.

1811
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:04.000
so maybe that's where
we need to live.

1812
01:16:04.133 --> 01:16:05.867
to create beautiful music.

1813
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.266
Sing a song!

1814
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.500
Yeah. I'm gonna!

1815
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.033
So as literature
has taught us.

1816
01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:24.367
over and over and over again.

1817
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.400
falling in love

1818
01:16:26.533 --> 01:16:28.700
is just common sense
leaving your body.

1819
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.867
You let your defenses down...

1820
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.033
...and you let
some idiot into your life

1821
01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:36.533
because why? Why?

1822
01:16:36.667 --> 01:16:38.166
Because--
Because he can carry a tune

1823
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.567
and he looks good in a fedora?

1824
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.400
Oh. boy.
Somebody got dumped.

1825
01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:42.400
I heard that. Bethany.

1826
01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.000
Poetry...

1827
01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:48.333
Poetry is the soundtrack
of our lives. okay?

1828
01:16:48.467 --> 01:16:50.433
Tragedy.
Pain.

1829
01:16:50.567 --> 01:16:53.100
We cannot let ourselves
be seduced by music!

1830
01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:54.033
I'm confused.

1831
01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:55.533
What does music
have to do with it?

1832
01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:57.433
I'm asking the questions. Erica.

1833
01:16:57.567 --> 01:16:58.567
Thanks. All right?

1834
01:16:59.767 --> 01:17:03.166
So. today. we're gonna focus
on the very prevalent theme

1835
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.734
in poetry--

1836
01:17:04.867 --> 01:17:06.000
the broken heart.

1837
01:17:06.133 --> 01:17:07.734
'Kay? Most profound quotes
on broken hearts.

1838
01:17:07.867 --> 01:17:10.066
Let's go!
Lay 'em on me now.

1839
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.233
Mineko Iwasaki--
"Stab the body and it heals.

1840
01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:14.567
but injure the heart
and the wound lasts a lifetime."

1841
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.967
Yeah.
Something to look forward to.

1842
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.834
Right? Next.

1843
01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.567
Pablo Neruda. "Deny me
bread. air. light. spring.

1844
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.567
but never your laughter--
for I would die."

1845
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.734
They say
they're gonna die.

1846
01:17:24.867 --> 01:17:26.567
But do they? Do they?

1847
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:27.967
Do they die?

1848
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:28.834
Yeah.

1849
01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:34.333
Uh... okay. that's. uh...
fire alarm.

1850
01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:36.133
Pack up your stuff quickly
and head outside.

1851
01:17:36.266 --> 01:17:37.667
Just right there. please.

1852
01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.033
Watch out.
There's a fire right there.

1853
01:17:39.166 --> 01:17:40.033
Yeah. Watch it.

1854
01:17:40.166 --> 01:17:41.300
Fire...

1855
01:17:41.433 --> 01:17:43.700
Smoke out there. Wow.

1856
01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:45.734
Yeah. watch out
for the smoke that's back there.

1857
01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:48.333
What are you doing?
You're supposed

1858
01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:49.867
to run out of the building
when the alarm goes off.

1859
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.367
Yeah. That was me. The alarm.

1860
01:17:53.767 --> 01:17:54.867
You know
you can get fined for that?

1861
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.800
Mm-hmm. but you needed someone
to save you from yourself

1862
01:17:57.934 --> 01:17:59.600
because that was
a five-alarm fire down there.

1863
01:17:59.734 --> 01:18:00.600
Mia.

1864
01:18:00.734 --> 01:18:02.133
I know you liked him.

1865
01:18:03.967 --> 01:18:07.266
Despite every fiber of my being
telling me not to...

1866
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.500
I just didn't listen.

1867
01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:11.667
Next time. I gotta listen
to that inner voice. I guess.

1868
01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.266
No! You listen to me.

1869
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.433
I'm gonna tell you something
about yourself. Mia Rivera.

1870
01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:17.667
In the last couple weeks.

1871
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.200
you were the person
you always were

1872
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:21.100
before Casey broke you down.

1873
01:18:21.233 --> 01:18:24.734
And it all started
with Penny Serenade.

1874
01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.767
Now. don't go back
into the cocoon.

1875
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Okay.

1876
01:18:31.367 --> 01:18:32.533
Okay. now let's get out
of here before I get arrested.

1877
01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.533
Let's go. Come on.
Fire! Oh. my god.

1878
01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:35.734
Yeah. and who did that?

1879
01:18:35.867 --> 01:18:37.567
Well. I don't know.
It's burning!

1880
01:18:40.533 --> 01:18:42.333
Hey. Rosie!
This is my mom. Valeria.

1881
01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:43.700
Mom. this is Rosie.

1882
01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:45.200
- Hi.
- Hi! Nice to meet you.

1883
01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:47.734
Thanks for taking care of
my girl while I was away.

1884
01:18:47.867 --> 01:18:49.533
There's an apartment
opening up in the building

1885
01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.400
- and we're gonna get it.
- Yeah.

1886
01:18:51.533 --> 01:18:52.767
It'll make it easier on everyone
when I'm traveling.

1887
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.100
So cool.

1888
01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:55.867
Rosie. what are you doing
out here all alone?

1889
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.867
My dad just went upstairs.
He forgot his phone.

1890
01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.867
I wanted to tell you

1891
01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:02.767
I'm really happy
that your dad moved back.

1892
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.467
I know it was
really important to you.

1893
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.800
What do you mean?
He's not back home.

1894
01:19:06.934 --> 01:19:08.166
He's not?

1895
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.266
I mean.

1896
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.433
only until Tuesday.

1897
01:19:10.567 --> 01:19:11.800
but that's only because

1898
01:19:11.934 --> 01:19:13.967
he's getting floors
put in his new apartment.

1899
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.734
Good to know.

1900
01:19:15.867 --> 01:19:17.266
I bet it is.

1901
01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:19.433
Are you okay with that?

1902
01:19:19.567 --> 01:19:20.934
I guess so.

1903
01:19:21.066 --> 01:19:22.734
And where's your mom
right now?

1904
01:19:22.867 --> 01:19:25.133
She went to see some boring
black-and-white movie.

1905
01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:28.166
There's not gonna be
anything boring about it.

1906
01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.333
I'll call you later.

1907
01:19:30.567 --> 01:19:31.633
Taxi!

1908
01:19:45.633 --> 01:19:47.667
[Irene Dunne. as Julie] When
your arms are holding me up.

1909
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.133
[Carey Grant. as Roger] When
you're with me. you're safe.

1910
01:19:49.266 --> 01:19:50.500
I hope that kiss
is all it's cracked up to be.

1911
01:19:50.633 --> 01:19:53.300
You wouldn't want Vivian
to be disappointed.

1912
01:19:53.433 --> 01:19:55.567
Not like Gina?

1913
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.133
Not like Jared Mendelbaum.

1914
01:19:58.266 --> 01:20:00.166
What are you doing here. Tony?

1915
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.166
I think we had what's known
as a "classic misunderstanding."

1916
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.333
Ho. Okay.

1917
01:20:06.467 --> 01:20:08.333
So you're not
with the beautiful brunette?

1918
01:20:08.467 --> 01:20:09.967
What?

1919
01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.767
I saw you
hugging on the street.

1920
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.500
Do you mean with Valeria.
my sister?

1921
01:20:16.567 --> 01:20:17.934
Oh!

1922
01:20:18.066 --> 01:20:19.300
I was talking about
Casey moving back in.

1923
01:20:19.433 --> 01:20:20.400
What?

1924
01:20:20.533 --> 01:20:21.633
Casey's not moving back in!

1925
01:20:21.767 --> 01:20:23.934
I know that... now.

1926
01:20:24.066 --> 01:20:25.633
Oh. he made you think he was.
didn't he?

1927
01:20:25.767 --> 01:20:27.500
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1928
01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:31.667
That's never gonna happen...

1929
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.800
...'cause my heart
belongs to someone else.

1930
01:20:40.967 --> 01:20:41.967
Uncle Harry?

1931
01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.166
And you know what?

1932
01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.734
I knew it
after just one kiss.

1933
01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.200
I love you.

1934
01:20:56.433 --> 01:20:57.300
I know.

1935
01:20:57.433 --> 01:20:58.633
You go. Vivian!

1936
01:20:58.767 --> 01:21:00.200
Shh! Come on!

1937
01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.467
Sorry.

1938
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.033
My mom would've loved you.

1939
01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:11.834
Oh. man. my mom would be
so crazy about you.

1940
01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.567
especially
if she heard you sing.

1941
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.233
I wish
I could've known her.

1942
01:21:15.367 --> 01:21:17.133
Yeah. Me too.

1943
01:21:17.266 --> 01:21:19.567
But I think they'd be happy
we found each other now.

1944
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.233
Not as happy as I am.

1945
01:21:27.433 --> 01:21:29.700

01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:32.133

have a good time tonight?

with a new one.

01:21:52.633 --> 01:21:53.734
It was one of
my mother's favorites--

1950
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:55.633
a lesser-known Frankie song.

1951
01:21:55.767 --> 01:21:57.500
but I can't sing it alone.

1952
01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.667
Mia. will you
come up here with me?

1953
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.967
Oh. gosh.
