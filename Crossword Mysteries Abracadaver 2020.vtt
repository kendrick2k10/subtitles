Back and forth to South America.

521
00:28:58.388 --> 00:28:59.912
I'm surprised she was in town.

522
00:28:59.955 --> 00:29:02.175
And after losing
her only sibling.

523
00:29:02.218 --> 00:29:04.133
you would think she would
want to reach out to me.

524
00:29:04.177 --> 00:29:06.048
I'm sorry.
but I have to ask this.

525
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.920
Was there anybody
at the Magic Manor

526
00:29:07.963 --> 00:29:09.878
that would have a grudge
against your nephew?

527
00:29:09.922 --> 00:29:11.445
I thought it was an accident?

528
00:29:11.488 --> 00:29:13.229
Well. we're not sure
exactly what caused his death.

529
00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:15.057
We're still waiting
on the autopsy reports.

530
00:29:15.101 --> 00:29:16.842
We're just looking
at every angle

531
00:29:16.885 --> 00:29:18.713
and one of those angles
is seeing what kind of conflicts

532
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.759
he had with coworkers.

533
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:23.674
- Well. there was Rocco.
- Rocco? Okay.

534
00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:28.505
Um. lately Alistair kept ranting

535
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:32.422
that Rocco was threatening to
take away his headliner status

536
00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:36.513
if he wouldn't give up a bigger
percentage of the ticket sales.

537
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:38.864
It was in Alistair's
contract. though.

538
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:41.083

546
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.537
Yes. sir.

547
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:03.976
This trick is called
"Balls in Cups."

548
00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:08.458
We start with
one. two. three empty cups.

549
00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:10.939
I'm gonna take a red ball.
gonna put it in the middle cup.

550
00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:14.856
I would like to get that ball
through that middle cup.

551
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.338
So I'm gonna put
one. two empty cups on top

552
00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:20.079
and I'm gonna tap it once.

553
00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:23.691
And... it's revealed
at the bottom.

554
00:30:23.734 --> 00:30:25.911
Who thinks they got it?

555
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:28.870
Ah. and that's
what we call a flash.

accidentally slips up

557
00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:32.961
and shows
what's really going on.

558
00:30:33.005 --> 00:30:35.834
If you botch a trick. you must.

559
00:30:35.877 --> 00:30:38.053
you need to improvise
and keep going.

560
00:30:38.097 --> 00:30:40.055
Alistair was a master at that

561
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:42.362
when we used
to preform together.

562
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.498
And that's
how we turn the lights on.

563
00:30:48.542 --> 00:30:50.065
Hm. so it is.

564
00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:51.893
So. listen. I was
wondering if you noticed

565
00:30:51.937 --> 00:30:53.721
anything suspicious
about that night.

566
00:30:53.764 --> 00:30:55.244
you know. anything
out of the ordinary?

567
00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:57.246
Nothing unusual.
It was a Saturday night

568
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.161
- and we were sold out.
- You wouldn't mind

569
00:30:59.205 --> 00:31:01.163
if I took a look at the
reservation list. would you?

570
00:31:01.207 --> 00:31:03.035
- No. it's this way.
- All right. appreciate it.

but... the show must go on.

to ask you any questions.

1042
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:05.644
My security team got concerned.

1043
00:52:05.687 --> 00:52:07.776
Do you always
walk around with security?

1044
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.082
It comes with the territory.

1045
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:10.301
So when the lights went out.

1046
00:52:10.344 --> 00:52:11.650
did you immediately
leave the premises?

1047
00:52:11.693 --> 00:52:12.999
Yes. we did.

1048
00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:15.219
No. actually.
we waited for the car out front

1049
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:16.568
and it took
a while to get there.

1050
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:18.222
So you just waited
around for your driver?

1051
00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:21.660
Good help is hard to find.
Are we done?

1052
00:52:21.703 --> 00:52:23.270
No. we're not done.

1053
00:52:23.314 --> 00:52:24.663
I was wondering if you could
tell me a couple of things about

1054
00:52:24.706 --> 00:52:26.795
this Jade bowl you
reported stolen at your party?

1055
00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:29.363
It was a fundraiser
and why don't you tell me?

1056
00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:31.670
- Got any information on that?
- No. I'm in homicide.

1057
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:32.671
That's with Grand Larceny.

1058
00:52:32.714 --> 00:52:33.976
I'm sure
they're looking into it.

1059
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.108
I'm sure they are.

1060
00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:36.109
I'll have them reach out.

1061
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:39.330
Great.
Have a good day. officer.

1062
00:52:47.816 --> 00:52:48.817
[laughter]

1063
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:52.256
I know.
Good to see you.

1064
00:52:52.299 --> 00:52:54.519
Let me guess.
You came in here.

1065
00:52:54.562 --> 00:52:57.130
you had to pay a jaywalking
ticket and got lost.

1066
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.220
Mm. Oh. did you know that
the meaning of "jay"

1067
00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:02.788
in jaywalking is drawn
from the early 20th century

1068
00:53:02.831 --> 00:53:06.444
definition of the word
meaning "greenhorn or rube"?

1069
00:53:06.487 --> 00:53:10.230
Mm. well I'm in homicide
not traffic control.

1070
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:13.320
Of course. Speaking of.
my aunt just told me her friend

1071
00:53:13.364 --> 00:53:17.498
Ethel Matthews had an antique
stolen the night of her party.

1072
00:53:17.542 --> 00:53:18.673
Alistair was
performing that night.

1073
00:53:18.717 --> 00:53:20.197
So. what.
you think Alistair's a thief?

1074
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.024
Well. I just
have learned in my magic class

1075
00:53:22.068 --> 00:53:24.505
that magicians have a way
of directing the audience's

1076
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:28.205
attention either towards
or away from certain things.

1077
00:53:28.248 --> 00:53:29.597
- Mm.
- So. I'm saying

1078
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:32.774
maybe Alistair distracted
the audience

1079
00:53:32.818 --> 00:53:37.344
while his associate
stole the antique snuff box.

1080
00:53:37.388 --> 00:53:39.781
And by "associate".
you mean Bianca?

1081
00:53:39.825 --> 00:53:43.872
Yes. it's what
magicians call misdirection.

1082
00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:46.440
No touch. okay? I got this
for my first year of service.

1083
00:53:46.484 --> 00:53:49.226
My point is Alistair
has a plus one on this list.

1084
00:53:49.269 --> 00:53:51.228
And my aunt said he had
a beautiful blonde with him.

1085
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:52.707
So? Bianca said he
was seeing someone.

1086
00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:54.796
I know.
But she just didn't know who.

1087
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.843
What's this?
"Meet me beyond the stars."

1088
00:53:57.886 --> 00:54:01.194
A love letter?

1089
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.978
You think this is from Bianca?

1090
00:54:03.022 --> 00:54:04.197
We thought it was from Bianca

1091
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:05.546
but the handwriting
doesn't match.

1092
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.548
So maybe it's this other woman.
the dance partner?

1093
00:54:07.592 --> 00:54:11.770
But we just
don't know who that is.

1094
00:54:11.813 --> 00:54:15.252
Wait a second. Ann Morrison?

1095
00:54:15.295 --> 00:54:17.428
I think I recognize her.

1096
00:54:17.471 --> 00:54:19.299
You recognize Ann Morrison?

1097
00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:20.605
Tess. she's from Indiana.

1098
00:54:20.648 --> 00:54:21.910
People there said
they haven't seen her

1099
00:54:21.954 --> 00:54:22.998
or heard from her in years.

1100
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:25.740

Wait. this is Sinclair!
I mean.

that anymore. but that's her.

- Yes. I'm positive.

You're positive?

1105

Have you seen or met Sinclair?

1106

just for some research.

Mm. research. right.

Mm-hm.

1109

I'll text you the address.

1110

Or should I say Ann Morrison.

1116
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.009
It's not against the law
to change your name.

1117
00:55:17.052 --> 00:55:18.663
No. No. it's not.

1118
00:55:18.706 --> 00:55:22.144
Ann never suited me.
Too plain for an illusionist.

1119
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:25.147
Yet we have no record
of a filing of change of name.

1120
00:55:25.191 --> 00:55:26.627
Sinclair is a trade name.

1121
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:28.455
Didn't have anything
to do with the death

as Zephyr in Las Vegas. did it?

1123

He died after leaving
a carload of flash powder

1124
00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:35.332
in the hot sun.

1125
00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:37.508

on the strip was 113 that day.

He was driving.

1127
00:55:40.293 --> 00:55:41.381
End of story.

1128
00:55:41.425 --> 00:55:43.296
And then there
was the disappearance

1129
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.603
of Ann Morrison.

1130
00:55:45.646 --> 00:55:49.041
Zephyr's death is what
inspired me

1131
