3
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:32.301
Careful with that.

4
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.678
That's not a toy!

5
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:40.267
Take off all your clothes. Put this on.

6
00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:43.687
The doctor will be here any minute.

7
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:55.491
Sit up.

8
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.466
Did you talk to your wife?

9
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.510
It's reversible. isn't it?

10
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.721
In some cases. but not always.

11
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.391
It depends on how much time goes by.

12
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:23.477
It's not wise doing this
without telling her.

13
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.771
My wife doesn't even know I'm here.

14
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:27.314
It's my right.

15
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.402
It's my body.

16
00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.948
A young man like you.
with no children... Think about it.

17
00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.576
You can’t have a vasectomy behind
your wife’s back.

18
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.780
Yeah?

19
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.283
Bruno. my man!

20
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:21.994
What are you up to?

21
00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:25.956
I’m up to my ass in ungraded essays.

22
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.084
Pure Nobel Prize material.

23
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.131
Give them a break. They're young.

24
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.259
Listen. Can you donate blood tomorrow?

25
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.928
Blood?

26
00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:45.768
My mother is having gallbladder surgery.

27
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.771
We need three donors.
but you know how it is.

28
00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.481
Those who can don't want to...

29
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.191
...and those who want. can't.

30
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.027
-Did you had any booze today?
-Nope.

31
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:57.988
Banged a hooker lately?

32
00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:00.658
Hell. no!

33
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.076
Well. you should.

34
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.496
Some street love wouldn't hurt you.

35
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.873
You can't eat or drink anything

36
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:09.667
I haven't said yes.

37
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.795
Don't be a dick. It's an emergency.

38
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.678
-Alright. I'll do it.
-Thanks. Bruno. I owe you one.

39
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:21.929
Bye.

40
00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:31.981
Professor?

41
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:34.692
Hi!

42
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.487
You don’t remember me.

43
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.199
Isabel. Isabel Estrada.
I was your student a couple years ago.

44
00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:43.742
Where?

45
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.828
"Where?"

46
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:48.872
Come on. I was your groupie!

47
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.875
Are you here to donate blood?

48
00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.671
Yes. A favor for a friend.

49
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.674
-So great you could do it.
-Clinically fit.

50
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.051
How about you? What are you doing here?

51
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:03.804
Bruno Sosa?

52
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.018
Got to go.
It was nice seeing you. professor.

53
00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.603
I hope next time you do remember me.

54
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.356
-Bye.
-Bye.

55
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.734
Ouch!

56
00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:19.653
There. there. It’s okay.

57
00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.781
-Is it?
-Yeah. all good.

58
00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:30.289
Your skin is so... smooth. Isa.

59
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.588
It hurts like a bitch. but it’s better
than those awful pills.

60
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:43.093
Next time you're feeling sick. call us.

61
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:47.097
Ibáñez said it was normal.
I didn't want to bother you.

62
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.350
Bother us? We're here to help you. baby.

63
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.772
I'm still taking you
to the hospital. right?

64
00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:08.869
I couldn't wait. Sorry.

65
00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:11.455
But you open them

66
00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:39.316
See. I told you everything was
going to be okay.

67
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.446
No crying or we won't be able to stop!

68
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.784
I’m already late. Can you give me a ride?

69
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:53.247
Isa...

70
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:58.085
Joaquín and I want you
to come live with us.

71
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.090
We want you around. Close.

72
00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:04.800
We want to be with you.

73
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.095
It'd be easier for the three of us.

74
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:11.932
We'll be there if you need us.
and you won't have to pay rent.

75
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.853
But this is my place and I like it.

76
00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.354
Yeah. but...

77
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.648
Our house is bigger...

78
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.067
...and cleaner.

79
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.488
Cleaner?

80
00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.493
Say yes. baby.

81
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.165
Let’s do this the right way.

82
00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.167
Together.

83
00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:44.923
We'll spoil you so bad.
you won't want to leave afterwards.

84
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.556
Come on. come on!

85
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.316
Turn it down!

86
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.318
Esteban!

87
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.489
Don’t sit so close to the TV.
Want to go blind or what?

88
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:14.494
Give that boy a whooping.
Just once for a change.

89
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:19.291
I would. but I'd have to hear his mom
bitching about it forever...

90
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.046
Children. man.

91
00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:30.302
You don't get to choose the bastards.
you can't give them back.

92
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.686
Where do you want this mirror?
How about here?

93
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.689
Over there is more like it.

94
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:45.317
But there's plenty of light here.

95
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.488
Maybe. but I like the picture
hanging just right there.

96
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.035
How about this?

97
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.085
How's the bed?

98
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.920
Great. isn't it?

99
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.382
Soft yet firm.

100
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.138
Isa...

101
00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.476
I'm the boss around here...
But Sara calls the shots.

102
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:25.732
Welcome. You're our special guest.
Whatever you want or need...

103
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.528
...tell me and it's yours...
As long as it's not too expensive.

104
00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.656
Taquito...

105
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.833
Hope he doesn't go crazy with
two ladies around the house.

106
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.503
Nothing ventured nothing gained.

107
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.798
Taquito. come!

108
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.800
Here. boy!

109
00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:54.052
Taquito!

110
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:58.765
I have some work to do.
but we can have dinner later. Together.

111
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:00.100
To celebrate.

112
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:09.568
Taquito!

113
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.947
Let's go. baby!

114
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.865
Guess who I ran into?

115
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.617
Who?

116
00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:00.702
Lucía.

117
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.455
She was with Paulina.

118
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.417
That girl looks just like her mom.

119
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.379
She’s a really pretty girl.

120
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:13.548
Lucky for her. she's not your daughter.

121
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:16.676
Thanks. friendo.

122
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.930
I thought...

123
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.474
...you were cool talking about Lucía.

124
00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.935
I am. I always hope
for the best for her...

125
00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.813
...for her. her daughter.
and the girl's father.

126
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.732
Man. you really need to get laid.

127
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:34.528
Bang one of your barely legal students!
One nail drives out another.

128
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:38.031
No way! Another nail. another hole.

129
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.828
My grandma took me to the park.

130
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:46.081
-And I saw some dogs.
-Really?

131
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.708
Why do dogs smell their butts?

132
00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.378
Okay.

133
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.880
That's how they say hello.

134
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:58.802
We shake hands and kiss
and dogs smell their butts.

135
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.054
What happen if they fart?

136
00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.474
I never thought about it.

137
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.019
I want a dog. No two dog.

138
00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.729
I didn't want the big.

139
00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:12.649
No honey. You can't have two dogs.

140
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.318
Two dogs.

141
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.655
I know you mommy.

142
00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.867
Give me a big kiss!

143
00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:23.660
I miss you mommy.

144
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.245
Tell me. honey...

145
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:29.207
-What's the name of your new school?
-It's...

146
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.877
Anytime León.

147
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:34.880
Go to grandma.

148
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.258
My school name is!

149
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.759
My school name is!

150
00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:41.928
My school name is!

151
00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:46.141
León. come here boy. Come here.

152
00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.310
No! Mommy! My school name is!

153
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.896
Go to grandma. León!

154
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.485
León. go to grandma.

155
00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.612
When are you gonna let me talk to my kid?

156
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:04.451
I don't want him speaking Spanish
in my house. all right.

157
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.286
There's no use for that shit here.

158
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.205
You're a fucking asshole.

159
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:10.874
Listen to me Harry.

160
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.668
I'm coming for him. I swear.

161
00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.545
I'm coming for him.

162
00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.508
Shut the fuck. all right. slut.

163
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.511
If you want anything
you talk to my fucking lawyer. Got it?

164
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.070
Isa?

165
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.279
Coming.

166
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.417
Isa? Dinner is rea--

167
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.504
What's wrong?

168
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:58.964
Nothing.

169
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.765
You are crying.

170
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:17.107
-I talked to León.
-Is he okay?

171
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.285
I'd tell you not to cry...

172
00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:33.456
...but is always better to get it off
your chest. Hang in there. baby.

173
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:36.167
Good things are coming.

174
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.045
For you and León.

175
00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.131
For us.

176
00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.055
Do you want some soup?

177
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.478
It will do you good.

178
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:43.712
Yes?

179
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.547
Mr. Bruno Sosa?

180
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:47.924
Speaking.

181
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.844
This is Isabel Estrada.
from Fellowship Bank.

182
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.221
Have you considered getting a credit card?

183
00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.766
I'm not interested. thank you.

184
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.184
Professor!

185
00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.648
It's me. Isabel. Your ex-student.

186
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.860
We met each other a few weeks
ago. at the hospital.

187
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.197
What hospital?

188
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.616
The blood bank.

189
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.203
Isabel.

190
00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:21.082
Why are you calling me?
How did you get my number?

191
00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.920
It’s in my database.
Since you didn’t ask me for mine...

192
00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.424
Actually. I'm updating my data.

193
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.968
I have your address. your number...

194
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.596
but I'm missing your marital status.

195
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.182
Are you still married?

196
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.727
What can I do for you?

197
00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.522
That’s exactly what I want to know.

198
00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.775
I want to invite you out to dinner.

199
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.908
If you don’t want to. it’s okay.

200
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.535
I wasn’t expecting your call.

201
00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.704
That's the whole point.

202
00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:03.541
I hope I’m not getting you in trouble.

203
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.127
-Trouble?
-With your wife.

204
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.964
We've been divorced for ages.

205
00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:13.426
Cool! Is eight o’clock good for you?

206
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:20.725
Either you tell me what's on your mind
or you stop staring at me like that.

207
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.520
Sorry.

208
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:26.356
I'm just thinking...

209
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:32.028
You want to know why I asked you out?

210
00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.631
You never signed it for me.

211
00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:33.006
"Life is a waterfall".

212
00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:39.053
Why did you stop writing?

213
00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.807
I haven't died yet.

214
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.686
Well. why haven't you written
anything new?

215
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.605
You were good.

216
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.232
You are good.

217
00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.111
Yes.

218
00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.656
How about you?

219
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.328
How did you end up working
at a call center?

220
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:09.042
I didn't graduate from college.
Met my ex...

221
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.878
...dropped out and move to Phoenix.

222
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.547
I just came back to Mexico
a few months ago.

223
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.592
That gig is temporary.

224
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.969
But I’m really good at talking to people.

225
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:23.264
I once opened eight credit card
accounts in one day.

226
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.974
Eleven is the record.

227
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.309
Eleven?

228
00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:33.691
I could get one. if it helps you.

229
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.572
It does help.

230
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.866
Thank you. professor.

231
00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.347
Seriously? You want us to use this?

232
00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:54.313
"Reinforced hypoallergenic latex."

233
00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.315
"Nonoxynol-9."

234
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.736
No shit! You got this
from a family clinic.

235
00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.864
That's all I’ve got.
Do you have any others?

236
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:14.042
Ultra-Ribbed? Pina colada flavor?

237
00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.253
They were out of strawberry.

238
00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:32.078
-You're leaving...
-Yep.

239
00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:33.704
Why so soon?

240
00:23:34.664 --> 00:23:39.335
The male smells the female...

241
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:42.547
...before she retreats to the mountains.

242
00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:47.844
He knows this could be
his last chance to mate with her.

243
00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:51.848
Last chance?

244
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.232
Give me your hand.

245
00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:07.196
I know you already have it.
but just in case.

246
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:17.373
-Should I call you a cab?
-It's okay.

247
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:24.297
Thanks. I had a good time.

248
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.756
Me too.

249
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.722
-Don't wash your hands!
-I swear!

250
00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:35.474
-Promise?
-Yes.

251
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:10.134
-Aren't you going to tell me?
-What do you want to know?

252
00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:15.139
Where did you go? Who is he? How was it?

253
00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:18.309
What friends tell to each other.

254
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:23.022
I met him in college.

255
00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:27.109
He asked me out and I said yes.

256
00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:29.403
Can we trust him?

257
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:33.157
Of course we can.

258
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:35.701
I was worried.

259
00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:38.454
-You turned your phone off.
-I didn't.

260
00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:40.831
Battery died.

261
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.098
Are you planning on seeing him again?

262
00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:43.352
Don't!

263
00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:45.229
Don't go.

264
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.815
Stay inside.

265
00:26:50.693 --> 00:26:51.819
But...

266
00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:58.117
I really have to pee.

267
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:59.845
We can do it again later if you want.

268
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.817
Bruno. what's wrong with your feet?

269
00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:15.486
Nothing.

270
00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:19.990
-You have six toes!
-No way.

271
00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:22.535
I’m looking at them!

272
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:26.664
Oh. you mean that. It's my spare.

273
00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:30.126
Just in case I stub my toe really bad.

274
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.962
-It looks gross!
-Really?

275
00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:35.714
-Yeah. yikes!
-I think it's sexy.

276
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.968
Besides...

277
00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:40.970
It’s not that weird.

278
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.098
Two in a thousand births.

279
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:47.768
My Dad and my grandpa had it too.

280
00:28:47.852 --> 00:28:50.646
Why didn't they remove it
when you were born?

281
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:52.898
Doctor said it was fine.

282
00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:55.568
Plus I like it. it gives me personality.

283
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.779
-I'd have gotten rid of it by now.
-Really?

284
00:28:58.863 --> 00:29:01.031
Absolutely.

285
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:03.576
Don't listen to her. buddy.

286
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:06.787
You know the drill.

287
00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:29.143
You should write another novel.

288
00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:32.438
One that’s as good as your first one.

289
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:36.150
No problem.

290
00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:39.445
Do you want me to start right now
or should I wait until you leave?

291
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.238
I'm dead serious.

292
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.451
If you need inspiration
I can be your muse.

293
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:48.871
It doesn’t work like that.

294
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.499
The true muse is the chair.

295
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.919
Inspiration lies in your ass.

296
00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:58.589
You sit the hell down
and start writing and writing...

297
00:29:58.672 --> 00:30:01.175
until you come up with something good.

298
00:30:09.642 --> 00:30:11.435
Why did you quit?

299
00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:13.604
What happened?

300
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:18.400
A divorce...

301
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:25.950
...and twelve useless drafts.

302
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:16.458
Do you think we should worry?

303
00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:26.218
Joaquín!

304
00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:29.305
Should we let her go out with
God knows who?

305
00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:32.099
-Without telling us anything?
-She’s only seen him twice. right?

306
00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:33.392
So far.

307
00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:37.813
First time she barely told me.
and the second time. she lied.

308
00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.273
She lied?

309
00:31:40.274 --> 00:31:43.611
Yesterday I was picking her up.
She cancelled on me.

310
00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:47.656
She told me she'd stay for training.
but then I saw her taking a cab.

311
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:49.825
So. I followed her.

312
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:53.412
-Come on!
-Do you want to know where he lives?

313
00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:58.417
You're on her side!
I just want to know who he is.

314
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.171
I trust her. but why doesn't she
trust me all of the sudden?

315
00:32:02.796 --> 00:32:04.590
Sara Fernanda. don't be paranoid!

316
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:06.634
You can't forbid her to see him.

317
00:32:06.717 --> 00:32:10.054
I’ll never forbid her anything.
I just want her...

318
00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:12.181
I just want her...

319
00:32:13.057 --> 00:32:14.642
to tell me.

320
00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:18.687
Please. don't smoke in here.

321
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.839
Nothing is sexier
nor so technologically advanced...

322
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:49.218
...than a female hip swaying to the
rhythm of my pelvis...

323
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:52.179
...and of my forever feverish hands.

324
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:56.225
Don’t forget your essays for next week.

325
00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.352
Thank you. Bye.

326
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:04.942
-Hello.
-Hi.

327
00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:08.320
-Joaquín Macías.
-Bruno.

328
00:33:09.363 --> 00:33:11.115
Do you know who I am?

329
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:13.033
Should I?

330
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.743
Probably.

331
00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:18.622
Isabel lives with me... and my wife.

332
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:21.667
-I'd like to talk to you.
-About what?

333
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.129
My wife and I want to meet you...

334
00:33:25.212 --> 00:33:27.798
...and talk about our situation.

335
00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:32.886
I didn't know Isabel was in "a situation".

336
00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:35.931
She didn't tell you?

337
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.058
Tell me what?

338
00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:41.353
What kind of friends are you?

339
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:46.108
I made a mistake.

340
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.693
Sorry.

341
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.904
Hey!

342
00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:53.449
Hey!

343
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.954
Come back here!

344
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.665
Hey!

345
00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:05.961
-Tell me! Why did you come here?
-Listen!

346
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:09.381
I shouldn't have come.

347
00:34:10.007 --> 00:34:12.050
I got carried away.

348
00:34:12.134 --> 00:34:13.135
I am sorry

349
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.054
I'm going to leave now.

350
00:34:16.305 --> 00:34:18.390
I’m not looking for trouble.

351
00:34:32.446 --> 00:34:35.032
Next time. I’ll make an appointment.

352
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:38.744
Who is Joaquín Macías? He went
looking for me at the university.

353
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.584
He's my roomie.

354
00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:48.128
-Your roomie?
-Yep.

355
00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:52.090
-I live with him and Sara.
-What's your relationship with them?

356
00:34:52.508 --> 00:34:55.135
I just told you. We're roommates.

357
00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:57.387
How did he know where to find me?

358
00:34:57.513 --> 00:34:58.931
I don't know.

359
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:04.394
Why did he leave when I asked him
about your relationship?

360
00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:12.861
Do you think I have sex with them?

361
00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:16.532
You do.

362
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.742
You think I fuck both of them.

363
00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.371
Joaquín and Sara sleep together.

364
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:25.332
I live with them because it suits me.

365
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.167
Actually...

366
00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:28.836
Call him.

367
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.921
Come on!

368
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.299
They’re dying to meet you anyways. right?

369
00:35:41.181 --> 00:35:43.350
-Wait.
-Let go off me!

370
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:47.104
I wanted to surprise you.
but I don't care anymore.

371
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.149
Is this an ultimatum?

372
00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.528
I'm just making things easier for you.

373
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:58.031
If you don't trust me.
don't be with me. Period.

374
00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:01.076
Move.

375
00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:04.371
Sure.

376
00:37:21.782 --> 00:37:23.742
I don’t dare to tear it.

377
00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:36.296
But I don't want my son
in a torn photograph.

378
00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:40.008
Where is he?

379
00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:47.557
Phoenix. With my ex.

380
00:37:48.517 --> 00:37:50.811
He never helped me to get my papers.

381
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:54.356
As soon as my visa expired.
I got deported.

382
00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:57.651
He got custody.

383
00:37:58.902 --> 00:38:01.279
Can you get him back?

384
00:38:04.658 --> 00:38:06.326
I don't know.

385
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:09.371
But I’ll never stop trying.

386
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:17.212
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:19.965
It's not something I like to share.

388
00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:24.136
What were you looking for?

389
00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:28.807
I'm not sure.

390
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.646
Are you done?

391
00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:48.702
Do you have to smoke so early?

392
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.912
Put it off.

393
00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:58.462
She's here.

394
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.388
I'll do the talking.

395
00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:35.874
Isa?

396
00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:39.002
Isa. can we talk?

397
00:39:43.924 --> 00:39:45.050
Isabel.

398
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.428
I can't live this. I'm neither
your daughter nor your employee

399
00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:50.597
Nobody thinks that.

400
00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:54.309
You made me look like a stupid teenager.

401
00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.561
You're right. I was out of line.

402
00:39:56.645 --> 00:40:00.357
But how come
you haven't tell him about us?

403
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.985
I don’t need your permission to screw
any man I want!

404
00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:07.697
You lied. you didn't tell us
you weren't coming home last night...

405
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:09.950
We're worried. Isabel!

406
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.244
I texted you.

407
00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:14.704
"I'll spend the night out. See you".

408
00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:17.165
And then you turned your phone off.
Don’t want to be treated...

409
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:19.251
...like a teenager? Don’t act like one!

410
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:24.631
We just want to meet him.
Why is that so hard to understand?

411
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:29.344
Where would you go?

412
00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:33.056
What about León?

413
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:40.772
I'm sorry.

414
00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:43.733
We're sorry.

415
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.987
We...

416
00:40:48.155 --> 00:40:51.324
We don’t fully understand
how to deal with this.

417
00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:17.684
I'm an idiot.

418
00:41:18.018 --> 00:41:19.644
Don't say that.

419
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:24.733
I made a mistake.

420
00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:29.905
I thought she was the one. I was wrong.

421
00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:31.740
We both chose her.

422
00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:35.535
She was the one we liked best.

423
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:45.086
I was terrified when
I saw her packing her bags.

424
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.926
To think she could leave. just like that.

425
00:41:52.135 --> 00:41:53.595
Whenever she wants.

426
00:41:57.807 --> 00:41:59.434
Tell me that won't happen.

427
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:02.395
We won't let her go! Please!

428
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:06.024
She won't leave. I promise. She won't.

429
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.776
Calm down.

430
00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:09.444
Sara. come on.

431
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.407
Isabel.

432
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.328
Isabel.

433
00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:23.083
Isa...

434
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.213
-Can I give you a lift?
-What are you doing here?

435
00:42:28.296 --> 00:42:32.050
I haven't heard from you.
You didn't even answer my texts.

436
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:35.845
How did you find me?

437
00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:37.847
Google. It wasn't easy.

438
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.143
Are you hungry? Let's go grab some lunch.

439
00:42:42.227 --> 00:42:44.229
-I can't.
-Listen. Isabel.

440
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:48.108
What's wrong?
Why don't you want to be with me?

441
00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:52.654
-What's going on?
-Isabel. don't get on that motorcycle!

442
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.826
She's Joaquín's wife.

443
00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:00.787
Isabel.

444
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:01.997
Stay in the car!

445
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:05.625
Who are these people?

446
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:08.670
-Let’s go. Isabel.
-Tell me. I want to know.

447
00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:10.922
Leave her alone!

448
00:43:11.006 --> 00:43:12.465
Isabel. Isabel.

449
00:43:14.134 --> 00:43:16.678
You hurt her. you idiot!

450
00:43:17.429 --> 00:43:20.015
Are you crazy?
She can’t ride on that motorcycle!

451
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.808
Didn't you tell him?

452
00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:24.227
Did you tell him or not?

453
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.772
She's pregnant. asshole!

454
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:16.154
Bruno.

455
00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:21.326
Let's talk.

456
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:25.246
I owe you an apology.

457
00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:28.166
It's fine.

458
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:34.130
You deserve to know the truth.

459
00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:39.386
The truth? We both know honesty
is not one of your virtues.

460
00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:45.558
It’s not my child.

461
00:44:49.396 --> 00:44:51.689
Whose child is it then? The Holy Spirit's?

462
00:44:51.773 --> 00:44:53.024
No.

463
00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:57.529
Is theirs.

464
00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:00.865
Her egg. his sperm.

465
00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:04.077
I only feed it.

466
00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.915
My family doesn't know. I'm on my own.

467
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.797
Good luck then.

468
00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:19.342
I pass.

469
00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:21.052
Wait.

470
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:23.096
You pass? On what?

471
00:45:23.513 --> 00:45:25.265
What's it to you?

472
00:45:27.434 --> 00:45:29.519
You lied to me.

473
00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:32.230
Well. yes but...

474
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:37.277
I'm doing this because I need
the money to get León back.

475
00:45:39.404 --> 00:45:43.616
I divorced the woman I loved most
because I didn’t want to have children.

476
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.329
I was this close from getting a vasectomy.

477
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:53.710
And now I’m fucking a pregnant
woman who rents her body?

478
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:03.303
Cool.

479
00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:06.681
Don’t get involved then.

480
00:46:10.643 --> 00:46:12.520
Sosa. you dumbass.

481
00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:16.483
You’ve been crying for years over Lucía
and now that you finally meet...

482
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:19.068
...a badass. carefree woman...

483
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:22.280
...you screw up.

484
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.075
Great story. though.

485
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:29.704
And of all people. it happened to you.

486
00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:35.043
Did you know there's not
a single word to describe...

487
00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:37.462
...the phobia to fatherhood?

488
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.174
Of course there is! "Tocophobia."

489
00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:45.929
No. that’s the fear
women have of pregnancy.

490
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:51.851
There isn’t a word to name
the irrational fear of paternity.

491
00:46:52.352 --> 00:46:54.979
Male tocophobia. perhaps.

492
00:46:55.063 --> 00:46:56.856
When a girl like that
comes into your life...

493
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.526
...you better sit down and write about it!

494
00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:03.780
Let’s see if you’re really such a good
writer after all.

495
00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:07.242
You lame-ass one-hit-wonder.

496
00:47:09.285 --> 00:47:10.662
Touché.

497
00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:27.804
Taquito. come!

498
00:47:28.972 --> 00:47:30.098
Come in!

499
00:47:35.228 --> 00:47:36.771
I'm not hungry.

500
00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:42.694
Tomorrow we have an appointment
with Dr. Ibáñez.

501
00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:44.404
I'm not going.

502
00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:49.492
I want to see another doctor.
Ibáñez is not helping me.

503
00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:53.580
-What?
-I’m not feeling any better.

504
00:47:53.705 --> 00:47:56.583
I’d rather see my doctor.
He knows me well.

505
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.627
Listen. you need a specialist.

506
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:01.879
-Not any doctor can...
-Sara...

507
00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:05.008
It's done. I went to see him already.
Everything's okay.

508
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:08.928
You went to see another doctor?

509
00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:11.681
Without me? When?

510
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:16.686
At least give him a chance.

511
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:23.776
This is not negotiable. Isabel.

512
00:48:24.444 --> 00:48:26.904
And what are you going to do about it?

513
00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.574
Are you going to drag me
to see your doctor?

514
00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:33.703
I decided to stay. but that doesn’t
mean things will be the same.

515
00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:41.169
Taquito. come... Come here!

516
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.734
It’s a little small for fourteen-weeks.

517
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:08.321
-Is that bad?
-Not necessarily.

518
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:12.033
In vitro babies
may take longer to develop.

519
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.202
The one I’m more
concerned about is Isabel.

520
00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:17.246
She’s underweight and pale.

521
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.501
Do you want to hear the heartbeat?

522
00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:23.002
Yes.

523
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:49.195
You’re doing well. If there’s any
complication. you come to see me.

524
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:53.366
They'll be fine. as long as
you don't give them reasons to worry.

525
00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:57.412
Don’t forget to take the iron complex...

526
00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:59.747
...and the folic acid everyday.

527
00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:09.882
My card was declined.

528
00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:11.884
Look at them.

529
00:50:12.135 --> 00:50:14.846
Sarah. I have no money.

530
00:50:25.148 --> 00:50:27.734
Has she told you where she knows
this doctor from?

531
00:50:28.443 --> 00:50:29.610
No?

532
00:50:48.337 --> 00:50:50.798
Don't! Honey...

533
00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:52.759
Please. don't do that.

534
00:50:52.842 --> 00:50:55.386
Are you crazy? He could choke on that!

535
00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.224
They’re late. aren't they?

536
00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:04.270
Aren’t you worried? Your husband
spending so much time with that girl?

537
00:51:04.353 --> 00:51:06.481
Her name’s Isabel. mother.

538
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:10.234
Only you could think of bringing a
total stranger into your home.

539
00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:12.111
Don’t start again with that.

540
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.490
I saw some pictures of her.
She looks nice.

541
00:51:17.492 --> 00:51:20.161
How long have you all
been living together?

542
00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:21.996
-Four months.
-Really?

543
00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:23.581
So fast!

544
00:51:23.664 --> 00:51:25.124
Alejandro!

545
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:28.169
Where were you?
You haven’t kissed your auntie yet!

546
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:30.880
Sit down right here with me. boy.

547
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.676
Okay. they're here.

548
00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:38.262
Be nice to her.

549
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:48.773
Everybody. this is Isabel.

550
00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:06.916
What about your backup plan?

551
00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:11.128
They didn't tell you
this was 100% effective. did they?

552
00:52:11.921 --> 00:52:14.173
No pregnancy is.

553
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:22.223
But if anything goes wrong. do you
have enough money?

554
00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:23.599
Yes.

555
00:52:23.975 --> 00:52:27.645
My dad owns some lands.
He gave me a few acres.

556
00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:30.940
I was planning on building a couple
of houses...

557
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:33.401
...but we could just sell the land
if we need to.

558
00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:34.777
God bless him.

559
00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:38.531
I hope everything turns out for the best.

560
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:40.491
But...

561
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:43.619
...if this doesn’t work either...

562
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:47.164
-...you should know when to give up.
-Give up?

563
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:54.672
Sweetheart. you know we love
Joaquín very much...

564
00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:58.134
...but he’s under
a lot of pressure right now.

565
00:52:58.217 --> 00:52:59.385
No. I'm not.

566
00:52:59.552 --> 00:53:02.805
Would you rather
being alone but together...

567
00:53:02.889 --> 00:53:05.474
...or having this child
and getting divorced?

568
00:53:07.476 --> 00:53:10.104
Stop putting yourselves at risk.

569
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:14.025
This can’t be good.
Not for you. not for the child.

570
00:53:14.317 --> 00:53:17.486
Do you know
who else has children like this?

571
00:53:17.987 --> 00:53:20.406
Lesbians and homosexuals.

572
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:21.699
So?

573
00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:23.409
What does that even mean?

574
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:28.414
We are not saying it's a sin...

575
00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:31.500
...but it’s definitely not the right way.

576
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:33.836
It is for me!

577
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.672
Isa has our last fertilized egg.

578
00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:40.635
If this fails. it’s bye-bye to my child.
bye-bye to your grandchild.

579
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:04.241
You can do this. Sara.

580
00:54:06.452 --> 00:54:08.162
Stay positive.

581
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:11.624
Try to relax. Meditate.
Go out for a walk. start jogging.

582
00:54:11.707 --> 00:54:15.044
It's all about attitude.
It's all about attitude. Sara.

583
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.797
Don't you worry. Sara.
We're going to make it.

584
00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:31.936
It's not all about attitude.

585
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:30.703
Thank you.

586
00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:39.545
-Howdy.
-Hi.

587
00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.881
-What's wrong?
-It won't start.

588
00:55:42.298 --> 00:55:46.010
-Did you call the mechanic?
-Too expensive.

589
00:55:54.727 --> 00:55:56.312
What is he doing here?

590
00:55:57.772 --> 00:55:59.231
I didn't invite him.

591
00:55:59.315 --> 00:56:00.649
Get in the house.

592
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:04.820
-What are you doing here?
-I just want to talk.

593
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:06.947
Get lost.

594
00:56:07.448 --> 00:56:08.783
It's important.

595
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:12.870
Five minutes. Please.

596
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.748
Go inside.

597
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.293
Go.

598
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.606
Dinner is ready...

599
00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:47.696
What's going on?

600
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:08.134
Joaquín!

601
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.719
Isabel? Isabel. breathe!

602
00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:13.013
-What?
-Isa?

603
00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:16.183
-What happened?
-I don't know! She fainted!

604
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:18.936
-Be careful.
-Isa.

605
00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:21.480
Put her on the couch!

606
00:57:25.818 --> 00:57:27.111
Okay.

607
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:29.488
Isabel.

608
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:31.657
Call an ambulance!

609
00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:50.342
This is taking forever. isn't it?

610
00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:59.977
I hope it’s not serious.

611
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:11.030
Well. she’s feeling better now.

612
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:14.992
We have to wait for the CBC.
She might have anemia.

613
00:58:15.284 --> 00:58:17.536
Are you letting her leave?

614
00:58:17.745 --> 00:58:21.749
Yes. just make sure that she eats
well and rests.

615
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:25.294
Isn’t it better if she stays here
for the night?

616
00:58:25.377 --> 00:58:28.255
Only if you want to pay for it.

617
00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:30.591
I'd rather not.

618
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:34.053
How's everything going?

619
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:36.764
Remember what we talked about last time?

620
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.600
Everything was fine...

621
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:43.896
...until today.

622
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.108
You must be the first-aider.

623
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:50.236
How do you feel?

624
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.738
I'm cold.

625
00:58:52.863 --> 00:58:56.450
Take her to dinner and we’ll see
about the lab results tomorrow.

626
00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:04.833
My treat. Please.

627
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:10.756
-I'm glad you're fine.
-Thanks.

628
00:59:13.717 --> 00:59:16.053
How did you meet?

629
00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:20.933
Did you sign an agreement?

630
00:59:21.016 --> 00:59:23.102
How did you put together a deal like this?

631
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:26.063
This is not a deal.

632
00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:30.276
Okay. but who sets the rules?

633
00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:33.112
We don't want to talk about this with you.

634
00:59:35.114 --> 00:59:37.992
Where is she giving birth?
Tabasco or Sinaloa?

635
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:40.160
Why do you care?

636
00:59:41.203 --> 00:59:43.289
I'm writing a novel.

637
00:59:44.957 --> 00:59:46.792
And your story drew me in.

638
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:48.752
What do you want to know?

639
00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.212
What?

640
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:55.050
After all we've been through.
we have a lot to tell.

641
00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:57.845
Thank you.

642
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.347
Don't even think about it.

643
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.692
How did you meet?

644
01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:16.697
Sara got in touch with her online.
Her and some other women.

645
01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.076
Wouldn’t it be better
if the surrogate mother...?

646
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.286
Substitute!

647
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.830
...were a relative instead of a stranger?

648
01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.206
Yes.

649
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:30.461
Our first choice was Sara's sister.
but she didn't pass the tests.

650
01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:32.796
Why did you choose Isabel?

651
01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:35.299
She was healthy.

652
01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:40.971
And despite her situation.
she didn’t seem desperate.

653
01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.600
-Is it expensive?
-The procedure?

654
01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.435
It isn’t cheap.

655
01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.812
But many clinics offer packages.

656
01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:53.400
And they guarantee a baby in
four transfers or a full refund.

657
01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:55.569
-Transfers?
-Embryo implantations.

658
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.529
Her eggs and my sperm.

659
01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.740
-And the four times...?
-Yes.

660
01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:06.955
We got our money back and we found Isa.

661
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.501
Did you think of adopting?

662
01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:19.426
We tried. but in this country.
adoption is even harder.

663
01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:24.681
What if Isabel decides to keep
the baby when--

664
01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.975
Can we change the subject?

665
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.313
-But what would happen if--
-She wouldn’t!

666
01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.441
She has León.

667
01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.944
That baby is mine!

668
01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:40.114
Mine.

669
01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.412
I'm sorry.

670
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:48.747
I should leave.

671
01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.833
I'll call you later.

672
01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:52.960
Take care.

673
01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:58.340
Eat up.

674
01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.496
Sara. I...

675
01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:34.793
I'm sorry.

676
01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:36.628
I'm an idiot.

677
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.975
I was really looking forward
to hear you story.

678
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.145
I'm sorry I screwed it up.

679
01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:06.658
Lucía. my wife... Ex wife...

680
01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:14.416
...she left me because
I didn't want to have children.

681
01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:22.799
Becoming a mother
was more important to her

682
01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:25.469
than being with me.
but I never understood why.

683
01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.555
Why didn’t you want to have children?

684
01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:36.396
"Fatherhood and mirrors are atrocious...

685
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.650
...since they both multiply
the number of men".

686
01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.071
Jorge Luis Borges said it.

687
01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:47.866
-Did he have children?
-Borges?

688
01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:49.826
No.

689
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.165
He didn't have a clue then.

690
01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.545
I wasn't ready.

691
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:06.260
I'm still not ready. but back then.
when we were together...

692
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.723
I thought a child would get in the way
of my writing.

693
01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:18.063
I wanted to be successful
before things got complicated.

694
01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.569
But she wouldn't wait for that to happen.

695
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.614
She did right.

696
01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:32.995
I can’t be responsible
for someone else’s life.

697
01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.874
I’d just fuck him up for sure.

698
01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:45.882
Well. I can’t wait to show the world to
someone who’s never lived in it.

699
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.775
I hope everything works out for you.

700
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.334
Life doesn't give a shit about obstacles.

701
01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.503
But sometimes it bets against itself...

702
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:27.591
And it becomes necessary
to resort to less orthodox methods...

703
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.093
A man and a woman.

704
01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:33.347
Two men and a woman.
Or two women and a man.

705
01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:35.015
A mother.

706
01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.558
Two mothers.

707
01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.519
Three mothers.

708
01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:42.648
Life makes its own way before.

709
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:46.526
after or when you least expect it.
but it always arises.

710
01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:09.091
Those who long for life should call it

711
01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.928
Wait and life will come.

712
01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:15.055
MOTHERHOOD FOR ALL OF US

713
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.058
Mexican. 27. healthy and willing...

714
01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:28.443
Being a surrogate mother
is a blessing but it's really hard!

715
01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.162
I'm a substitute mother. Can we meet?

716
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:43.750
-Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl?
-No. we want it to be a surprise.

717
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.421
Look at that little shirt.

718
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.256
So cute!

719
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.510
Did you get baby blues?

720
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.387
Yeah. it was awful.

721
01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.515
When that baby leaves
your womb. it feels like...

722
01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.519
...emptiness.

723
01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.354
Terrible!

724
01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:05.605
It hurts.

725
01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.816
But then you get over it.

726
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.866
Was it hard for you?
Handing over those babies?

727
01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:19.077
Not really. You don't even
have time to feel bad about it.

728
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.580
The nurse barely let me saw them.

729
01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:25.125
I counted their fingers
and toes and said good-bye.

730
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.590
Are they paying well?

731
01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:32.883
Yes.

732
01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:34.342
Great!

733
01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:38.054
It didn't go so well for me.
I did the numbers and...

734
01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:41.933
...24 hours. 7 days a week
for 9 whole months...

735
01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:45.145
I hardly made minimum wage per day.

736
01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.980
-No way!
-I kid you not.

737
01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:52.694
Plus. in no other job you're not
allowed a beer every once in a while.

738
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.961
Did they give you fertility drugs?

739
01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:14.466
The shots and patches and what-not?

740
01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:18.094
Then you know all
the crazy things your body does.

741
01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:23.266
My breasts kept producing milk
for months after giving birth.

742
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:28.355
I felt like filling bottles
and mailing them to the parents.

743
01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.531
Wow! The color is amazing!

744
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.617
So fancy.

745
01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:48.875
Why did you want to meet?

746
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.128
Did you ever think about keeping them?

747
01:08:55.257 --> 01:08:56.466
Yes.

748
01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.010
Once.

749
01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:03.431
I was three weeks away from giving birth.

750
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:09.771
I had such strange dreams with that baby.

751
01:09:11.565 --> 01:09:15.443
The kind of dreams I never had
with any of my children.

752
01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:19.823
One day...

753
01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:23.994
...I had a panic attack.

754
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.248
Instead of going
to my doctor's appointment...

755
01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:33.837
...I locked myself
and cried all afternoon.

756
01:09:37.382 --> 01:09:39.009
The next day it was over.

757
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:44.097
I went to my appointment.
as if nothing had happened.

758
01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.141
It's pretty normal.

759
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:49.644
Even if the baby
doesn't look like you at all...

760
01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:53.523
...you two will have a bond that the
biological mother won’t.

761
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.283
You’re not considering keeping
someone else’s child. are you?

762
01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:07.913
Not after all you told me
about your own son...

763
01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:13.543
Why would you do that to yourself?

764
01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.342
This one. I'm taking this one.

765
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.969
Yes. that one is cute.

766
01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.807
But look at this!

767
01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:31.561
Okay. That's cuter.

768
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.855
It looks so pretty!

769
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.273
Canales...

770
01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:38.443
Jesus Alfonso Esquivel.

771
01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:44.115
Your balance is 87--

772
01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.868
Give me a sec.

773
01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:16.147
The placenta is blocking the cervix.

774
01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:21.820
If it stays in that area.
there could be some complications.

775
01:11:22.237 --> 01:11:25.991
Chances are
Isabel will go into preterm labor.

776
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.326
How many weeks?

777
01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:31.579
As few as possible.

778
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.127
We’ll have to schedule a C-section
to prevent further risks.

779
01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:43.550
I’m also giving her something to
strengthen the baby’s lungs.

780
01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.721
But the baby will be fine. right?
Fully developed?

781
01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:51.266
Let us hope for that.
That's why we are here.

782
01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:55.061
Everything will be fine.

783
01:12:03.737 --> 01:12:07.782
I need a second opinion.

784
01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:11.161
I'll make an appointment with Dr. Ibáñez.

785
01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.830
We need more money.

786
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.002
Maybe she'd allow us to pay her later.

787
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.213
No. we’re not touching Isabel’s money.

788
01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:25.467
I can't ask for a second mortgage.
I'll have to go to San Luis.

789
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.303
-Don't think about that now!
-If not now. when?

790
01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.555
This wasn't supposed to happen!

791
01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:33.391
After your last attempt...

792
01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:37.395
...I asked you to drop all this
for good. but you didn’t listen.

793
01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.482
Our last attempt.

794
01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:43.234
You want this as much as I do.

795
01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.490
Are you sure about that?

796
01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.918
I need to get some sleep.

797
01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:03.880
I have a meeting tomorrow.

798
01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.341
I'm out of here.

799
01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:18.770
Are you feeling okay?

800
01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.731
You're scaring me. baby. What's wrong?

801
01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:25.026
Let's go back to the hospital.

802
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:26.569
I can't.

803
01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:28.738
I can't.

804
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.284
You trust in me. I can’t let you down...

805
01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:34.661
I'm sorry.

806
01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:37.789
I'm sorry.

807
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.104
You're doing well! Say it!

808
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.149
Everything will be alright!
Get it into your goddamn head!

809
01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.651
-Let her go!
-Swear everything will be fine!

810
01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:10.113
-Promise me. damn it!
-I promise!

811
01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.201
Don't touch me!

812
01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:30.341
Do you regret it?

813
01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.427
No.

814
01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:35.513
Nope. but I want this to end.

815
01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:37.974
Chinese say:

816
01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:42.228
"Out of 100 kilometers
99 are just half of the way."

817
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:45.982
Precisely.

818
01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.901
That's how it feels.

819
01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:52.614
I brought you something. Hand me my purse.

820
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.099
Your agreement.

821
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:34.155
They won't pay you if the baby dies?

822
01:15:40.912 --> 01:15:43.248
Did you notice how "substitute"...

823
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:46.584
...and "prostitute" are almost the same?

824
01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:52.632
Don't get upset.

825
01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:54.425
Think about it.

826
01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.972
You're offering your body
in exchange for money...

827
01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:03.351
...so others can fulfill
a biological need.

828
01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:06.604
I'm not doing it only for the money.

829
01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:10.566
But would you do it
without getting anything in return?

830
01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.236
Altruistic?

831
01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:16.781
-You're such a drama queen.
-It's your ass on the line!

832
01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:19.242
They only have to sign a check.

833
01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:23.288
-I shouldn't have brought you anything!
-Think about it the other way around.

834
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.207
The baby is born. but you die.

835
01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:30.878
Then what? Will they look for
your son to give him your money?

836
01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:32.672
Sara had four miscarriages...

837
01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.174
...what if the same had happened to you?

838
01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:41.848
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

839
01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:50.023
Have you ever used one of these?

840
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.238
I want you to always carry it around.

841
01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:01.326
When you want to say anything.
anything at all...

842
01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.286
...just record it.

843
01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:06.289
Click. Stop.

844
01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:14.797
Hello.

845
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.344
I’m crazy about you.

846
01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:30.772
Do you want to be there? Until the end?

847
01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.567
See how it all turns out?

848
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.117
Bruno. don't.

849
01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:45.411
Sorry.

850
01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.748
I can't.

851
01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.501
Joaquín. Sara. the baby...

852
01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:53.503
It's too much.

853
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:58.966
Maybe when I'm done with all this
and León is with me again...

854
01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.843
We can give it a shot.

855
01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:09.102
May I... take a nap?

856
01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:55.189
It's a five-hour trip. It won't take long.

857
01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.319
-Where are you going?
-San Luis.

858
01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.864
There's someone interested
in buying the land.

859
01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:06.742
-When are you coming back?
-As soon as I close the deal.

860
01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:15.168
All set.

861
01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:25.178
Take care.

862
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:26.762
The three of you.

863
01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:04.425
Hi there. baby. How you doing?

864
01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:08.304
Cool?

865
01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:17.146
I hope at least one of us is having fun.

866
01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:52.890
Who is it?

867
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.017
It’s Isa. professor.

868
01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:18.708
Hi.

869
01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:24.338
Watch it!

870
01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:32.013
How come you're not working?

871
01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.015
I am.

872
01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:38.769
Almost done?

873
01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:40.855
Maybe.

874
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.482
Don't know. Don't ask.

875
01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:49.113
I want to ask you something
very important.

876
01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:50.531
Yeah?

877
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.410
Please stop that!

878
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.705
Fuck!

879
01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.918
No fucking way! No. please. no!

880
01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:10.885
How the hell did this happen? Damn it!

881
01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.222
Look what you did.

882
01:22:15.306 --> 01:22:17.391
-Me?
-You pushed me!

883
01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.311
Come on. come on. come on.

884
01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:27.610
No! No! This isn't happening.

885
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:31.489
Fucking hell! Go away!

886
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:34.992
-Sorry. I just...
-I need to think!

887
01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.869
Get out!

888
01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:39.246
Shouldn't you be resting?

889
01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:42.792
Get the fuck out of here! Damn it!

890
01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.587
I'm leaving to run some erran--

891
01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:30.297
Isa?

892
01:23:30.715 --> 01:23:31.757
Isabel!

893
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.970
You don't have a back up file?

894
01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:40.683
Only the chapters I emailed you.
but everything changed a lot.

895
01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.185
Final draft was almost done.

896
01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:45.146
-And the hard-disk?
-Busted.

897
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:48.524
They couldn't repair it.
Fuckin' piece of trash.

898
01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:54.864
There are so many freakin' ways
to make a back up file!

899
01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:59.160
Dropbox. Google Drive. that
iCloud shit nobody knows how it works!

900
01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:04.415
-Dad. what should I write here?
-I don't know. What's the question?

901
01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:07.251
This. but I don't know the answer.

902
01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.628
Think about it. It's quite easy.

903
01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:12.423
-Fuckin' piece of...!
-Hey. calm down!

904
01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:15.968
Only good stuff i've written
in years and it's fucked up!

905
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:19.054
If you're that angry
you should better leave.

906
01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:21.640
And watch your language
in front of my kid.

907
01:24:24.018 --> 01:24:27.772
It's okay. dad. I've heard that before.

908
01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:30.441
That's not the point.

909
01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:34.653
He shouldn’t say that in my house.
Did you understand anything?

910
01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:38.574
-Sure. he said fu--
-No. I mean about your homework!

911
01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:47.333
-Hello?
-Hello.

912
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.919
Bruno? It's me. Sara.

913
01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:51.879
Is Isa with you?

914
01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:53.881
She's not here.

915
01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:57.259
And to be honest. I don't think
I'm gonna see her again.

916
01:24:57.802 --> 01:25:00.805
-Isn't she taking your calls?
-No

917
01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:06.227
Maybe her battery died
or she has not signal.

918
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:10.147
She's not supposed to be
anywhere but here. resting.

919
01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:19.990
Would you call her?
Just to be sure that she's okay.

920
01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:21.283
Please.

921
01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:23.911
Okay.

922
01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:27.581
Okay. Ciao Sara

923
01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:28.874
Thanks.

924
01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:38.843
When coming to see me?

925
01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:41.762
Soon. Mi Amor. Very soon.

926
01:25:41.846 --> 01:25:44.640
-Are you coming today?
-Today?

927
01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:48.978
When do you come?
Pick a day. When is that?

928
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:52.106
Honey. your dad is still there?

929
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:54.233
No. dad is in the bathroom.

930
01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.485
Can we speak Spanish now?

931
01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.612
I would like to hear you.

932
01:25:58.863 --> 01:25:59.864
Tell me...

933
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:02.449
How are you doing in school?

934
01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:04.451
Have you make any new friends?

935
01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.037
León.

936
01:26:07.121 --> 01:26:09.123
Listen to me. please.

937
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.001
León. León.

938
01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.795
León. honey. look at me.

939
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.798
Look at me. please.

940
01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:21.552
I thought you liked
speaking Spanish with me.

941
01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:25.222
You're not here. I can't see you.

942
01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:27.141
León. León.

943
01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:30.728
Dad gets angry hen I speak Spanish.

944
01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.146
León. León.

945
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:35.065
I don't want him getting angry at me.

946
01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:40.404
Okay. maybe some other day.

947
01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:23.948
Are you okay?

948
01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:32.998
Where were you?

949
01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.628
Where?

950
01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.178
Are you hungry?

951
01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.056
Answer me!

952
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:48.532
Taquito.

953
01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:53.579
Isa?

954
01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:57.666
Isabel. Isabel!

955
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.718
Isabel! Say something. goddamnit!

956
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.844
-How is she?
-I don't know.

957
01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:55.015
She's been in the O.R. for hours
and they haven't told me anything yet.

958
01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:08.612
Thank you for coming.

959
01:30:11.532 --> 01:30:14.785
I don't feel like calling
my family right now.

960
01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:33.971
First time I met her
I thought we would make it.

961
01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:40.853
Deep down we shared the same pain.

962
01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:44.356
All the other candidates
had their children with them.

963
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.900
Isa was the only one who didn’t.

964
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:52.698
I felt her suffering.

965
01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.494
That's why I chose her.

966
01:31:15.179 --> 01:31:17.097
I hate waiting.

967
01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:27.441
Hell is made of waiting.

968
01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:43.999
The baby is alright now.

969
01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:47.628
We'll keep her in the incubator.
but prognosis is positive.

970
01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:52.591
It's a... girl?

971
01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:57.763
What about Isabel?

972
01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:02.392
She suffered postpartum hemorrhage.

973
01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:05.604
Placenta was deeply attached.

974
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:10.275
She lost plenty of blood
before we could sew her up.

975
01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:13.153
She didn't respond
to blood transfusions...

976
01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:17.241
...and she wasn't clotting properly.
I'm sorry.

977
01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:21.620
Everything I did. I did to help her.

978
01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:23.283
Hi. Sara.

979
01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:29.790
What do you think?

980
01:34:30.082 --> 01:34:31.666
Say hi. baby.

981
01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:36.588
She looks just like Joaquín.
don't you think?

982
01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:41.134
Beer?

983
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.054
How about you?

984
01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:45.639
Come in.

985
01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:49.559
Congratulations. Sara.

986
01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.062
You did it.

987
01:34:55.107 --> 01:34:58.318
Did you have any trouble
with the birth certificate?

988
01:34:58.652 --> 01:34:59.778
No.

989
01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:05.367
Joaquín's name was on the medical record.

990
01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:10.330
It may sound awful but...

991
01:35:10.414 --> 01:35:12.165
It was easier for us.

992
01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:14.418
What's her name?

993
01:35:17.879 --> 01:35:19.214
Isabella.

994
01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.472
Did you finish your novel?

995
01:35:27.556 --> 01:35:28.849
Not yet.

996
01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.311
Let us know when you do.

997
01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.647
I'd love to read it.

998
01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:38.775
Isabella.

999
01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:48.160
Who are you looking at?

1000
01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:52.914
Could you watch her for me?

1001
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.128
I won't take long.
Come closer. she's restless.

1002
01:36:24.571 --> 01:36:25.822
Isabella.

1003
01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:30.911
You are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1004
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.376
Do you want to know why did I ask you out?

1005
01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:20.669
Don't Stay inside

1006
01:37:22.087 --> 01:37:25.006
Sara had four miscarriages

1007
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.675
What if the same had happened to you?

1008
01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.301
Clinically fit.

1009
01:37:32.973 --> 01:37:34.558
It's yours. right?

1010
01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:37.602
It's was among Isabel's stuff.

1011
01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:42.524
What's going on. my baby?

1012
01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:57.122
Can I use the bathroom?

1013
01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.834
It's okay. honey. Come to mamma.

1014
01:38:02.252 --> 01:38:04.504
Are you leaving already?

1015
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:07.257
Everything is fine. honey.

1016
01:38:08.258 --> 01:38:10.385
-What happened?
-About what?

1017
01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:13.305
-Bruno...
-Don't know.

1018
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:16.016
She calms down when you're around.

1019
01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:17.601
I'm her father.

1020
01:39:04.648 --> 01:39:07.150
Click. stop.

1021
01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:09.778
Click. stop.

1022
01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:13.615
I’m crazy about you.

1023
01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.371
Hi. professor.

1024
01:39:21.373 --> 01:39:24.042
I wanted to see you.
so I went to your place.

1025
01:39:25.377 --> 01:39:29.673
I stood outside your building.
waiting for my finger to ring the bell.

1026
01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.134
But it didn't happen.

1027
01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:36.054
I didn't know how.

1028
01:39:36.846 --> 01:39:39.307
I was afraid that you'd be at home.

1029
01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:43.520
That you'd let me in. despite
what happened the last time.

1030
01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:46.606
Now. I'm here...

1031
01:39:48.108 --> 01:39:49.526
...feeling lost...

1032
01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:53.154
...and surrounded by these huge buildings.

1033
01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:02.747
You told me to use the recorder
in case I had something to say.

1034
01:40:02.831 --> 01:40:04.582
So here I am.

1035
01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.210
Where should I begin?
