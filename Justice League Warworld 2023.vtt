3
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:43.279
Come on. I’m good for it.
Payday’s Tuesday.

4
00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:49.890
Ha!

5
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.924
You see that. Griz?

6
00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:53.465
Plugged it
right through the middle!

7
00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.850
Almost got him.

8
00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:38.136
Whiskey.

9
00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:42.580
Don’t get
a lot of strangers
passing through.

10
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.341
Certainly not
pretty ones like you.

11
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:51.149
Uh. anyone tell you
you’re a pretty fine piece?

12
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:58.189
Girl. are you
hard of hearing
or something?

13
00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:02.094
I heard. Go away.

14
00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:29.594
You just made the biggest
and last mistake of your life.

15
00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:44.774
Argh!

16
00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:03.727
No one likes
a back-shooter. Tom.

17
00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:08.094
Outside. now.

18
00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:15.706
I apologize for my men.

19
00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:20.535
They can be rough
around the edges.

20
00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:25.507
But then again. so is the town.

21
00:04:25.507 --> 00:04:28.785
Perhaps you’d join me
for a drink?

22
00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:32.184
I’ll give you the good stuff.

23
00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:50.565
Those were some moves
you had. downstairs.

24
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:53.502
Never seen anyone
fight like that.

25
00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:58.177
You’re a wonder.

26
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.353
How’d you get the face?

27
00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:12.928
By trusting the wrong people.

28
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.832
It’s a tale
as old as time itself.

29
00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.836
Gold is discovered
and everyone is happy.

30
00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:23.103
And then greed
shows its ugly face

31
00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:25.336
and ruins everything.

32
00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.473
Those so-called
honest townsfolk

33
00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:31.375
took over the bank.

34
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.014
which had repossessed
their land

35
00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:35.643
for delinquent
interest charges.

36
00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:38.019
Which you did legal. I’m sure.

37
00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:39.185
Now. my judges.

38
00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:43.156
every one said
we was in the right.

39
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.586
But they stole back the gold

40
00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:46.830
they used to pay
for their stakes.

41
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.393
and this cannot stand.

42
00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:51.934
We’re a civilized society.

43
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:53.001
a land of laws.

44
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:58.204
If this bunch gets their way.
why then. where would we be?

45
00:05:58.204 --> 00:06:01.108
I’m guessing
you’re going to tell me.

46
00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:07.444
There’s an opportunity
for you here.

47
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:11.855
Help me fight
for law and order.

48
00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:13.648
- Help me--

49
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.489
Hyah!

50
00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:22.734
Hyah!

51
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.737
- Whoa!

52
00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:35.945
We don’t want no trouble.

53
00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:39.080
Heading to the depot
for a fresh start.

54
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.483
Huh?

55
00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.353
-  Pa!

56
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.840
No!

57
00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:16.480
Ma!

58
00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:51.680
Do it.

59
00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:04.066
Shoot that damn woman.

60
00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:13.878
Kill her!

61
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:22.381
Open the gate!

62
00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:26.891
Argh!

63
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.563
They killed
them both.

64
00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:44.733
I know it’s hard.
Now you’ve got to be brave.

65
00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:56.987
I told ’em
they should sneak off at night.

66
00:08:56.987 --> 00:09:00.353
but they didn’t want to leave
behind what little they had.

67
00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:01.750
Now they got less.

68
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.785
Bat Lash. you damn fool!

69
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:05.622
Why you making trouble
with Hex’s men?

70
00:09:05.622 --> 00:09:09.527
Because sometimes trouble’s
got to be made. Sheriff.

71
00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:10.660
What do you care?

72
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.036
You don’t ranch.
farm. or dig gold.

73
00:09:13.036 --> 00:09:15.434
You don’t have
a dog in this fight.

74
00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:18.173
And why are you mixing in this?

75
00:09:18.173 --> 00:09:21.506
I’m not. Just passing through.

76
00:09:22.243 --> 00:09:24.542
Supplies would be appreciated.

77
00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:27.743
Does it look like
we got extra stuff?

78
00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:31.549
At least give us your name
before you ride off.

79
00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:40.998
They’re coming again!

80
00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:55.947
Got a present
for all you stubborn folk.

81
00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:10.621
I hope it sends you to hell.

82
00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:12.557
Shoot the wheels.

83
00:10:28.408 --> 00:10:29.838
Hyah!

84
00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:45.128
Oh. my God.

85
00:10:49.924 --> 00:10:51.827
She’s an angel.

86
00:10:51.827 --> 00:10:53.961
That’s why she’s not hurt.

87
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:56.304
Come to save us all.

88
00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:00.803
- Are you okay?
-  Okay?

89
00:11:00.803 --> 00:11:04.147
How are you
not axle grease?

90
00:11:30.074 --> 00:11:31.075
I’ve had a think.

91
00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.769
and it may just be easier

92
00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:34.903
to kill you all.

93
00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:36.542
Eat lead.

94
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.037
What the hell are you?

95
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.978
Well. you certainly kicked
that hornet’s nest in the face.

96
00:12:16.978 --> 00:12:18.485
Now Hex will kill us all.

97
00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:21.422
He was gonna
do that anyway.

98
00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:22.918
She saved us.

99
00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:24.623
Saved us?

100
00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:28.264
We’re starving
and dying of thirst here!

101
00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:31.058
I passed a storehouse
on my way in.

102
00:12:31.058 --> 00:12:33.632
Plenty of supplies there.

103
00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:35.304
Great idea!

104
00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:36.239
Go ask Mr. Hex

105
00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:39.671
if’n you could load
a wagon or two of his stuff

106
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.969
after blowing him up!

107
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.608
Not a bad idea.

108
00:12:42.608 --> 00:12:44.478
The supplies. I mean.

109
00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:46.447
Need a distraction. though.

110
00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:50.814
On occasion.
I can be distracting.

111
00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:07.303
My mistake was showing mercy.

112
00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:13.969
I took half measures.

113
00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:16.180
No more.

114
00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:20.184
You got something to say?

115
00:13:22.483 --> 00:13:23.979
Well. sir.

116
00:13:24.254 --> 00:13:26.553
that outside. was a goat rope.

117
00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:28.082
Oh. it sure was.

118
00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:29.226
And you boys think

119
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:32.119
you could make
better decisions than me?

120
00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:33.923
That’s right.

121
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:39.467
I ever tell you
about this timepiece?

122
00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:43.801
My great grandfather carried it
through the Revolutionary War.

123
00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:46.309
My grandpappy.
through the War of 1812.

124
00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:49.972
My pa had it during
the Mexican-American War.

125
00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:53.580
And I took it through the war
between the states.

126
00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:56.814
Had to hide it for a year
from the Yankee Guards

127
00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:59.718
after I was captured at Shiloh.

128
00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:01.687
Uncomfortable.

129
00:14:01.687 --> 00:14:03.887
but still keeps the time.

130
00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:08.892
We don’t give a damn
about your grandpappy’s watch!

131
00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:10.729
Oh...

132
00:14:10.729 --> 00:14:13.237
But you very much should.

133
00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:14.095
You see.

134
00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:20.002
my family has always settled
their disputes with this watch.

135
00:14:20.673 --> 00:14:23.170
Now. when the chimes stop.

136
00:14:27.977 --> 00:14:29.682
make your move.

137
00:15:30.578 --> 00:15:32.877
Been meaning to fix that.

138
00:15:48.827 --> 00:15:51.599
I’ll load up.
Need five minutes.

139
00:16:07.142 --> 00:16:10.321
I was wondering
when you’d show up.

140
00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:12.686
Throwing your lot in
with a bunch of thieves

141
00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:15.117
doesn’t match
your code now.
does it?

142
00:16:15.117 --> 00:16:20.287
And realizing that mistake.
here you are.

143
00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.190
Looks like.

144
00:16:22.432 --> 00:16:25.798
Maybe we could strike a deal.

145
00:16:28.163 --> 00:16:31.133
But of course.
you’d have to convince me.

146
00:16:32.002 --> 00:16:35.940
And I’m going to need
both types of convincing.

147
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.384
You think you can handle
being physical with me?

148
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.609
We hijack
the train at Sweetwater.

149
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.875
and load the nitro.

150
00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:13.747
We detonate it
by the barricade.

151
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:17.586
It’ll vaporize everyone inside

152
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.182
any minute now.

153
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:25.495
-  Hyah!

154
00:17:50.784 --> 00:17:51.620
I got to say.

155
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.622
you’re real handy
to have around.

156
00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:55.217
You trust me?

157
00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:57.021
Damn straight. I do.

158
00:17:57.021 --> 00:17:58.594
Get everyone
out of the barricade.

159
00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:01.597
I’m gonna end this
once and for all.

160
00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:09.572
Hyah!

161
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.590
Argh!

162
00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:36.764
Hurry up.
let’s get out of here!

163
00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:40.900
Are you crazy?

164
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.266
You go out there.
you’ll get these kids shot.

165
00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:45.839
Sheriff. we’ve got to leave.

166
00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:50.481
The angel’s coming back.
and she’s coming back angry.

167
00:19:54.336 --> 00:19:56.745
I’m putting in for hazard pay.

168
00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:58.010
Look!

169
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:07.382
Since there’s. uh.
nothing left to fight over.

170
00:20:07.382 --> 00:20:09.021
you could stay.

171
00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:10.891
With us.

172
00:20:27.204 --> 00:20:30.537
Nothing’s over until I say.

173
00:21:03.614 --> 00:21:04.846
Ahhh!

174
00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:17.353
Would you have stayed?

175
00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:07.007
Welcome to my home.

176
00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:10.846
Welcome to Shamballah.

177
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:49.313
Ugly one. aren’t you?

178
00:23:00.093 --> 00:23:01.963
And the prisoners?

179
00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:02.964
To the mines.

180
00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:06.737
Their sword arms will be put
to work swinging picks.

181
00:23:06.737 --> 00:23:09.135
Until the next
mercenary arrives.

182
00:23:09.135 --> 00:23:12.633
We should have killed Deimos
when we had the chance.

183
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.339
I understand your ire. friend.

184
00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:16.670
But we cannot change the past.

185
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:21.048
only ensure the same mistakes
are not made in the future.

186
00:23:21.477 --> 00:23:22.984
Gather those that are able.

187
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:27.714
We’ll strike back.
finish Deimos once and for all.

188
00:23:30.453 --> 00:23:32.488
Something funny. slave?

189
00:23:33.863 --> 00:23:34.765
Mercenary.

190
00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:36.624
There is a difference.

191
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.561
Not from where I’m standing.

192
00:23:40.529 --> 00:23:42.234
You take an army
to the wizard’s.

193
00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:45.699
your queen might as well
look for another king.

194
00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:48.471
You’ll be dead
before you see his face.

195
00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:51.309
And let me guess.
for your freedom.

196
00:23:51.309 --> 00:23:54.081
you’ll lead us
to his throne room?

197
00:23:55.984 --> 00:23:56.985
No.

198
00:23:56.985 --> 00:24:00.824
For my freedom
and a pile of gold.

199
00:24:03.024 --> 00:24:06.830
You give me those.
I’ll draw a map to his castle.

200
00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.624
Mercenary. remember?

201
00:24:10.064 --> 00:24:12.869
You can’t possibly
be considering this.

202
00:24:12.869 --> 00:24:14.761
How can we trust him?

203
00:24:14.937 --> 00:24:16.400
We can’t.

204
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.974
That’s why he’s coming with us.

205
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.537
The hell I will.

206
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.145
You want your coin?
You want your freedom?

207
00:24:25.145 --> 00:24:27.741
Then you’ll earn it
like the rest of us.

208
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:30.018
Or you can enjoy
the darkness of the mines

209
00:24:30.018 --> 00:24:32.185
until you’re old and gray.

210
00:24:42.624 --> 00:24:44.098
Is this necessary?

211
00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:47.299
Be grateful.
it’s only one chain.

212
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.499
Machiste...

213
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.403
For Skartaris!

214
00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:29.539
Mariah. scout ahead.

215
00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:31.607
It’s high time we make camp.

216
00:25:34.577 --> 00:25:36.579
It’s best to wait for night.

217
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.515
Night?

218
00:25:38.845 --> 00:25:40.088
The darkness.

219
00:25:40.088 --> 00:25:41.155
You know as well as I.

220
00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:44.224
the sun shines
forever on Skartaris.

221
00:25:48.327 --> 00:25:49.427
Yes.

222
00:25:49.427 --> 00:25:52.562
Where did you say
you were from. mercenary?

223
00:25:53.563 --> 00:25:54.762
I...

224
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.945
It matters not.

225
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.444
You come to kill a king
with a mercenary horde.

226
00:26:06.444 --> 00:26:07.918
wearing a strange helmet.

227
00:26:07.918 --> 00:26:10.712
and yet you don’t know
where you’re from.

228
00:26:10.712 --> 00:26:14.815
I am your prisoner.
not your gossiping harlot.

229
00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:20.326
There’s a wooded glade.
an arrow’s shot away.

230
00:26:20.557 --> 00:26:21.789
Lead on.

231
00:26:38.443 --> 00:26:40.016
Mercenary.

232
00:26:44.218 --> 00:26:45.582
How long now?

233
00:26:45.582 --> 00:26:47.254
Across the Desert of Dreams.

234
00:26:47.254 --> 00:26:50.917
where men see visions
that are more than visions.

235
00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:53.920
Then a short ride
through the Dragon Sea.

236
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.395
What can you tell us
about this wizard?

237
00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:58.001
His fortress?

238
00:26:58.001 --> 00:26:59.200
Not much.

239
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.335
Not... Why are you here. then?

240
00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:05.767
I told you. I could
take you to his castle.

241
00:27:05.767 --> 00:27:07.175
Beyond that.

242
00:27:07.175 --> 00:27:09.936
you’re the ones
intent on dying.

243
00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:12.477
You fear his magic.

244
00:27:12.477 --> 00:27:14.776
I don’t fear much of anything.

245
00:27:14.776 --> 00:27:18.714
Besides. I don’t
believe in magic.

246
00:27:19.352 --> 00:27:21.123
What do you believe in?

247
00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:23.851
Steel. Gold.

248
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:27.492
The evil
in the hearts
of all men.

249
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.891
Then you keep poor company.

250
00:27:30.891 --> 00:27:34.037
My king is a good man.

251
00:27:34.961 --> 00:27:35.731
Do you think so?

252
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:39.141
Because he fights
for truth and justice?

253
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:40.670
No.

254
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.870
All men are evil.

255
00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:44.740
He knows as well as I.

256
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.315
the darkness
that resides in our souls.

257
00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:53.023
Then it is up to us
to stand up to the darkness.

258
00:28:08.995 --> 00:28:10.172
I’ve seen a jester

259
00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:12.966
slit the throat
of his own king.

260
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.244
Men made of ice
steal from the poor.

261
00:28:16.244 --> 00:28:18.378
and women more cat than woman

262
00:28:18.378 --> 00:28:20.512
manipulate the just.

263
00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:22.382
And no one could stop them.

264
00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:26.617
Because evil
is as unstoppable as the rain.

265
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.753
That’s why we fight
for those that can’t.

266
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:31.853
A good man knows

267
00:28:31.853 --> 00:28:34.064
that the darkness
will always be there.

268
00:28:34.064 --> 00:28:36.594
but stands against it anyway.

269
00:28:36.594 --> 00:28:42.435
Unlike mercenary scum like you.
who care only about yourself.

270
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.142
How did you come
to be in his employ?

271
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:48.243
He found me.

272
00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:52.610
He promised me riches
if I would take your head.

273
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.084
And you took it

274
00:28:54.084 --> 00:28:58.220
because death is nothing
to a man with no life.

275
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.718
You know nothing about me.

276
00:29:02.554 --> 00:29:03.951
Neither do you.

277
00:29:10.463 --> 00:29:11.959
What is it?

278
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.837
To the trees!

279
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.188
Argon and Rapasil.

280
00:29:34.223 --> 00:29:35.081
And you.

281
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:38.326
you may have saved my life.
but don’t think you can escape.

282
00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:44.167
I’m not up here to escape.

283
00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:45.894
I’m waiting to see

284
00:29:45.894 --> 00:29:48.028
what those creatures
were running from.

285
00:29:53.572 --> 00:29:55.068
Like hell.

286
00:30:38.584 --> 00:30:41.323
There.
Baroth Mountain.

287
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:55.865
Hold.

288
00:30:57.834 --> 00:30:59.209
What is it?

289
00:30:59.407 --> 00:31:00.870
I’m not sure.

290
00:31:19.053 --> 00:31:20.428
To shore!

291
00:31:23.497 --> 00:31:25.301
Argh!

292
00:31:52.724 --> 00:31:55.221
The sooner
this cursed quest is over.

293
00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:56.596
the better.

294
00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:06.232
It’s... It’s...

295
00:32:06.606 --> 00:32:09.642
It’s you. isn’t it?

296
00:32:20.554 --> 00:32:22.787
Visions that are not visions.

297
00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:53.356
Climb!

298
00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:13.706
Here!

299
00:34:14.668 --> 00:34:15.933
Mariah.

300
00:34:27.846 --> 00:34:29.617
Something isn’t right.

301
00:34:34.787 --> 00:34:36.756
What isn’t right
is we’re taking too long.

302
00:34:36.756 --> 00:34:40.254
Every second we waste
is one in which more could die.

303
00:34:40.254 --> 00:34:44.830
I’m going in. even if
you’re too scared.

304
00:34:46.568 --> 00:34:48.064
Machiste. no!

305
00:34:57.645 --> 00:34:58.976
It’s hopeless.

306
00:34:58.976 --> 00:35:02.012
What good are we
against such magic?

307
00:35:02.012 --> 00:35:05.312
Weren’t you the one who said
good men stood against evil.

308
00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:07.248
despite the odds?

309
00:35:35.914 --> 00:35:37.344
What is it?

310
00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:58.541
How did you know?

311
00:35:58.904 --> 00:36:00.466
I’m not sure.

312
00:37:16.014 --> 00:37:18.049
Run. Run!

313
00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:03.490
Give me the key.

314
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:07.703
This is no time! Hurry!

315
00:38:21.409 --> 00:38:23.180
You can’t.

316
00:38:24.148 --> 00:38:25.116
I can.

317
00:38:25.116 --> 00:38:27.954
You know the rule
when running from a beast.

318
00:38:27.954 --> 00:38:30.693
be faster than
the man you’re with.

319
00:39:04.188 --> 00:39:05.893
Where is Warlord?

320
00:39:10.832 --> 00:39:12.163
Dead.

321
00:39:20.974 --> 00:39:22.404
Who are you?

322
00:39:23.405 --> 00:39:26.672
I don’t know.

323
00:39:27.376 --> 00:39:29.444
There was a wreck. I think.

324
00:39:29.444 --> 00:39:31.182
and then Deimos found me.

325
00:39:31.182 --> 00:39:32.887
Enough chatter!

326
00:39:33.118 --> 00:39:34.152
Help us out of here.

327
00:39:34.152 --> 00:39:37.419
We can still kill the wizard.
and save Skartaris.

328
00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:40.026
No.

329
00:39:40.026 --> 00:39:41.896
I want no part of your quest.

330
00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:45.691
Besides. there’s no time
to save you.

331
00:39:45.691 --> 00:39:49.233
But there is enough time
to save myself.

332
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.536
Ah-ah-ah.

333
00:39:56.108 --> 00:40:00.145
You don’t want my magic wand
to speak again. do you?

334
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.481
So. you’ve returned.

335
00:40:06.921 --> 00:40:08.384
And your mission?

336
00:40:09.385 --> 00:40:10.386
Completed.

337
00:40:10.386 --> 00:40:12.421
The Warlord is dead.

338
00:40:13.763 --> 00:40:16.392
This was your plan all along.

339
00:40:16.392 --> 00:40:18.130
Of course.

340
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.165
Attack Warlord. lose.

341
00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:21.936
Convince the Warlord
to come here

342
00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:24.268
where I can kill him myself.

343
00:40:26.237 --> 00:40:28.470
I’ll take my payment now.

344
00:40:30.043 --> 00:40:34.047
After you fulfill
one small task for me.

345
00:40:34.047 --> 00:40:38.788
Do this last thing.
and you will have your riches.

346
00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:50.261
Do it. coward.

347
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.297
I can’t...

348
00:40:54.265 --> 00:40:55.662
I won’t...

349
00:40:57.004 --> 00:40:58.698
let you kill them.

350
00:40:58.698 --> 00:41:00.568
Ah-ha! Yes.

351
00:41:00.568 --> 00:41:01.536
Well. I’m not surprised.

352
00:41:01.536 --> 00:41:05.815
Oh. well. one less person
I don’t have to pay.

353
00:41:31.533 --> 00:41:34.206
I should let you
kill each other.

354
00:41:34.206 --> 00:41:35.669
You!

355
00:41:35.669 --> 00:41:38.474
Time to die. wizard.

356
00:41:38.474 --> 00:41:42.049
My sentiments exactly.

357
00:42:16.446 --> 00:42:17.678
Ugh!

358
00:42:31.967 --> 00:42:33.199
Enough!

359
00:42:36.301 --> 00:42:37.797
How dare you!

360
00:42:37.797 --> 00:42:42.142
You pathetic mortals think
that I. the great Deimos.

361
00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:44.804
would fall so easily?

362
00:42:44.804 --> 00:42:49.050
I am more than
mere flesh and blood.

363
00:42:50.216 --> 00:42:53.285
I am magic incarnate.

364
00:42:53.923 --> 00:42:56.882
I am the ruler of Skartaris.

365
00:42:56.882 --> 00:43:00.259
I am the master of this realm.

366
00:43:00.556 --> 00:43:05.462
I am your death!

367
00:43:32.225 --> 00:43:33.028
Can you fight?

368
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:34.920
Free me and find out.

369
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.013
I know this.

370
00:44:24.013 --> 00:44:27.445
I’ve been trapped
here for years.

371
00:44:28.842 --> 00:44:32.384
My name is Travis Morgan.

372
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:37.983
and I am the Warlord.

373
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.952
Deimos!

374
00:44:56.375 --> 00:45:01.380
I will have
my revenge. Warlord.

375
00:45:12.193 --> 00:45:15.889
My Lord. where is Machiste?

376
00:45:17.726 --> 00:45:19.431
I’m sorry. Mariah.

377
00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:24.073
It’s over now.

378
00:45:24.073 --> 00:45:25.602
We can return home.

379
00:45:28.374 --> 00:45:31.212
I could use
more warriors like you.

380
00:45:32.213 --> 00:45:33.478
Come back with us.

381
00:45:33.478 --> 00:45:36.041
No. I need...

382
00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:38.219
To find a way back.

383
00:45:39.352 --> 00:45:40.584
Yes.

384
00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:42.619
But to where?

385
00:45:52.332 --> 00:45:53.333
Home.

386
00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:54.730
Come with us.

387
00:45:55.104 --> 00:45:56.435
Morgan...

388
00:45:58.338 --> 00:45:59.636
No.

389
00:45:59.636 --> 00:46:02.672
This is my home. my people.

390
00:46:02.936 --> 00:46:04.344
And I am their king.

391
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:09.481
I need to be here
to protect them from Deimos.

392
00:46:11.076 --> 00:46:12.484
Good luck.

393
00:46:47.783 --> 00:46:50.819
Sir? Agent Kent.
Main office sent me.

394
00:46:50.819 --> 00:46:52.557
Ah. the new partner.

395
00:46:52.557 --> 00:46:53.360
I’m...

396
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.021
Agent Faraday. I know.

397
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:56.297
Purple Heart in Iwo Jima.

398
00:46:56.297 --> 00:46:57.991
Founder of the
Central Bureau of Intelligence.

399
00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:00.367
Lead agent during
the Janus Directive incident.

400
00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:02.303
Yeah. I know the resume. son.

401
00:47:02.303 --> 00:47:03.469
I lived it.

402
00:47:03.469 --> 00:47:04.866
They really threw you
in the deep end

403
00:47:04.866 --> 00:47:06.934
with your first
assignment. huh?

404
00:47:06.934 --> 00:47:09.376
What did they
tell you about this?

405
00:47:09.607 --> 00:47:11.213
At 0700 hours.

406
00:47:11.213 --> 00:47:13.578
strange lights were seen
over the town of Grover’s Mill.

407
00:47:13.578 --> 00:47:17.648
Six witnesses claim they saw
something fall from the sky.

408
00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:19.848
I’m thinking
it’s the Russians. sir.

409
00:47:19.848 --> 00:47:20.651
Another Sputnik.

410
00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:22.818
It came from space. all right.

411
00:47:23.082 --> 00:47:26.426
But think... farther.

412
00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:34.566
We’ve been dispatched here
on behest of Majestic-12.

413
00:47:34.566 --> 00:47:37.998
a program that investigates
UFO sightings.

414
00:47:38.207 --> 00:47:40.132
This might just qualify.

415
00:47:40.132 --> 00:47:42.508
It’s up to us
to interrogate the witnesses

416
00:47:42.508 --> 00:47:43.773
and find out what happened.

417
00:47:43.773 --> 00:47:46.314
Now’s the time
to prove yourself.

418
00:47:46.314 --> 00:47:51.946
Are you ready to uphold truth.
justice. and the American way.

419
00:47:51.946 --> 00:47:53.321
no matter what?

420
00:47:53.618 --> 00:47:56.423
Yes. sir. No matter what.

421
00:47:57.952 --> 00:48:00.856
Then get ready
to meet the peanut gallery.

422
00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:22.174
Ho there. Officer...

423
00:48:22.174 --> 00:48:24.979
Officer Wayne. highway patrol.

424
00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:27.146
Witnesses are inside.

425
00:48:27.289 --> 00:48:28.422
Excellent.

426
00:48:28.422 --> 00:48:31.788
Officer Wayne.
my partner. Agent Kent.

427
00:48:33.922 --> 00:48:35.396
Do I know you?

428
00:48:36.628 --> 00:48:38.267
Let’s get started.

429
00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:40.434
After you. Officer.

430
00:48:41.864 --> 00:48:43.096
Officer?

431
00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:44.735
Officer Wayne?

432
00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:48.068
Yes. apologies. I was...

433
00:48:48.574 --> 00:48:49.872
Never mind.

434
00:48:49.872 --> 00:48:51.544
Strange fellow.

435
00:48:52.743 --> 00:48:54.481
You all right there. son?

436
00:48:54.646 --> 00:48:56.241
Just dandy. sir.

437
00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:04.854
- Oh. thank God...
- We’ve been here an hour.

438
00:49:04.854 --> 00:49:06.559
- ...finally an authority.
- Is it safe to go out there?

439
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.924
Gentlemen. ladies. please.

440
00:49:08.924 --> 00:49:09.892
I’m Agent Kent.

441
00:49:09.892 --> 00:49:13.599
And he’s here to ask us
about the little green men.

442
00:49:14.402 --> 00:49:17.603
This is no joke!
I know what I saw.

443
00:49:17.603 --> 00:49:18.901
We all saw it. lady.

444
00:49:18.901 --> 00:49:20.507
How long is this going to take?

445
00:49:20.507 --> 00:49:21.673
As long as it needs to. sir.

446
00:49:21.673 --> 00:49:24.071
It takes as long as it takes.

447
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:27.272
For Uncle Sam
and his United States. man.

448
00:49:27.272 --> 00:49:31.419
Well. I am happy to stay
as long as the agent needs.

449
00:49:31.419 --> 00:49:32.112
I’m not.

450
00:49:32.112 --> 00:49:33.520
I’ve got a tanker
in a snow drift

451
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.521
and a route to keep.

452
00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:36.248
But we know
you hit the snowbank.

453
00:49:36.248 --> 00:49:38.987
The pileup’s why
we saw the blasted thing.

454
00:49:38.987 --> 00:49:40.285
Please. everyone...

455
00:49:40.285 --> 00:49:41.286
You got a problem?

456
00:49:41.286 --> 00:49:44.696
Well. you could have been
driving more carefully. is all.

457
00:49:44.696 --> 00:49:46.665
- Lot of nerve you got!

458
00:49:46.665 --> 00:49:49.701
The American government
appreciates your cooperation

459
00:49:49.701 --> 00:49:50.999
in this matter.

460
00:49:50.999 --> 00:49:53.199
Isn’t that right. Agent Kent?

461
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.607
Uh. yes.

462
00:49:54.607 --> 00:49:56.103
Please take a seat.

463
00:49:56.103 --> 00:49:58.710
Names and occupations.
beginning with...

464
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.614
Potter. Long-haul trucker.

465
00:50:01.614 --> 00:50:03.011
Mr. and Mrs. Lang.

466
00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:05.849
As of last Tuesday.

467
00:50:05.849 --> 00:50:07.719
We’re on our honeymoon.

468
00:50:07.719 --> 00:50:08.687
Snapper Carr.

469
00:50:08.687 --> 00:50:09.919
Temporary weekend manager!

470
00:50:09.919 --> 00:50:12.757
You’re not going
to call the owner. are you?

471
00:50:12.757 --> 00:50:15.056
I really need
this gig to work out.

472
00:50:15.056 --> 00:50:17.630
Burroughs Ginsburg Kerouac.

473
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:19.995
Occupation. drifter!

474
00:50:19.995 --> 00:50:21.469
All right. Mr. free spirit.

475
00:50:21.469 --> 00:50:23.702
want to tell my partner
what you saw?

476
00:50:23.702 --> 00:50:25.407
I was hitching down Highway 5.

477
00:50:25.407 --> 00:50:29.378
I politely step
onto the shoulder
so people can see me.

478
00:50:29.378 --> 00:50:30.170
Ha!

479
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:31.479
That loon jumps out. I brake.

480
00:50:31.479 --> 00:50:35.879
and suddenly I’m in a snowbank
with two cars on my bumper.

481
00:50:36.209 --> 00:50:37.914
That’s when we hear it.

482
00:50:37.914 --> 00:50:39.982
It was shrill and whistling

483
00:50:39.982 --> 00:50:41.522
like a scream.

484
00:50:41.522 --> 00:50:43.689
Made your teeth vibrate.

485
00:50:44.954 --> 00:50:46.351
We look up.
and. Agent. I swear.

486
00:50:46.351 --> 00:50:52.401
overhead was a flying saucer.
like right out of the movies!

487
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:53.963
- Then--
-  Bam!

488
00:50:55.503 --> 00:50:58.264
It hits something
in the distance.

489
00:50:58.264 --> 00:50:59.606
And then...

490
00:50:59.936 --> 00:51:01.333
And then...

491
00:51:01.575 --> 00:51:02.411
And then?

492
00:51:02.411 --> 00:51:04.875
This light starts coming
from where it crashed.

493
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:06.943
and it’s not right.

494
00:51:06.943 --> 00:51:09.374
I’ve never seen
a light like that.

495
00:51:09.374 --> 00:51:12.179
I never want to see that again.

496
00:51:12.179 --> 00:51:14.082
The thing slammed
into the old barn

497
00:51:14.082 --> 00:51:15.116
at the end of the road.

498
00:51:15.116 --> 00:51:18.152
When we get there.
there’s footprints around it.

499
00:51:18.152 --> 00:51:21.353
We figure. hey. someone’s hurt.

500
00:51:21.353 --> 00:51:22.794
We split up to look.

501
00:51:22.794 --> 00:51:24.994
I walk around back.

502
00:51:24.994 --> 00:51:26.468
and that’s when I see it.

503
00:51:26.468 --> 00:51:27.997
We saw it!

504
00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:28.833
My hand to God.

505
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:31.671
it was an alien
running out of that barn.

506
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.838
Ask that girl
if you don’t believe us.

507
00:51:33.838 --> 00:51:35.400
She saw it. too.

508
00:51:39.976 --> 00:51:42.110
Name and occupation. ma’am.

509
00:51:44.013 --> 00:51:46.081
I’m sorry. Um...

510
00:51:46.081 --> 00:51:48.721
You’re asking? Oh. Ms. Prince.

511
00:51:48.721 --> 00:51:50.415
I’m a secretary.
Mainly a typist.

512
00:51:50.415 --> 00:51:53.891
I... I was on my way to work
when it all happened.

513
00:51:54.188 --> 00:51:55.123
I...

514
00:51:55.123 --> 00:51:56.597
I think...

515
00:51:56.861 --> 00:51:57.763
It’s all fuzzy.

516
00:51:57.763 --> 00:52:00.260
I... I remember
lights in the sky.

517
00:52:00.392 --> 00:52:01.294
but I was alone.

518
00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:03.362
I’m sorry. I must be
in shock from the accident.

519
00:52:03.362 --> 00:52:04.902
I don’t remember anything

520
00:52:04.902 --> 00:52:06.607
until Officer Wayne
brought us here.

521
00:52:06.607 --> 00:52:09.170
I’m... I’m sorry.
-  Psst.

522
00:52:16.078 --> 00:52:16.980
I didn’t say this before

523
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.279
because I didn’t want
everyone to hear.

524
00:52:19.279 --> 00:52:20.214
I was at the counter

525
00:52:20.214 --> 00:52:22.755
when that officer
walks in with the lot of them.

526
00:52:22.755 --> 00:52:26.154
Says to wait
for the authorities.

527
00:52:26.693 --> 00:52:27.892
but I didn’t call the cops.

528
00:52:27.892 --> 00:52:30.664
and there’s no phone
at the old mill’s barn.

529
00:52:30.664 --> 00:52:32.666
So. how did he show up so fast?

530
00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:37.132
Agent. we all followed
that alien’s footprints.

531
00:52:37.132 --> 00:52:39.970
But when we got back
to the barn. I counted.

532
00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.040
There were five sets
of tracks going
into the woods.

533
00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:46.141
and six coming back.

534
00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:50.277
Are you saying the alien
might still be in this area?

535
00:52:51.146 --> 00:52:52.587
I’m saying the alien...

536
00:52:52.587 --> 00:52:55.689
might be
in this room.

537
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.483
It could’ve changed its shape.

538
00:52:58.483 --> 00:52:59.858
Look like one of us.

539
00:52:59.858 --> 00:53:02.696
Project images into your mind.

540
00:53:02.894 --> 00:53:03.796
Confuse you.

541
00:53:03.796 --> 00:53:09.538
Anyone acting odd may not be
who they say they are. man.

542
00:53:09.538 --> 00:53:10.396
If I were you.

543
00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:12.838
I’d look to anyone
who seems different.

544
00:53:12.838 --> 00:53:15.401
Foreign. Strange.

545
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:16.974
Weird.

546
00:53:16.974 --> 00:53:18.679
Un-American.

547
00:53:18.679 --> 00:53:20.373
Not like you and me.

548
00:53:20.373 --> 00:53:21.374
And when you find them.

549
00:53:21.374 --> 00:53:22.980
you got to take care
of them right away.

550
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.346
Or else you’ll give them
a foothold into your mind!

551
00:53:26.346 --> 00:53:27.446
I think it’s her.

552
00:53:27.446 --> 00:53:29.283
That cop
showed up out of nowhere.

553
00:53:29.283 --> 00:53:30.724
Are you
gonna protect us?

554
00:53:30.724 --> 00:53:32.660
Will you
do your job?

555
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:35.762
Agent Kent.
answer the question.

556
00:53:35.762 --> 00:53:36.796
Yes.

557
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.094
I... I mean. no.

558
00:53:38.094 --> 00:53:38.930
I mean. I’m...

559
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.702
Sir. I’m just trying
to get information. okay?

560
00:53:42.802 --> 00:53:46.003
And [loudly] would you turn
that damn jukebox off?

561
00:53:46.003 --> 00:53:48.104
But it is off.

562
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.105
Uh. excuse me.

563
00:54:22.105 --> 00:54:23.612
The music.

564
00:54:23.612 --> 00:54:25.273
We hear it too.

565
00:54:25.273 --> 00:54:26.076
I’m sorry.

566
00:54:26.076 --> 00:54:28.573
I have to ask you to go back
with the other witnesses.

567
00:54:28.573 --> 00:54:30.916
No. Listen to us.

568
00:54:38.418 --> 00:54:41.025
What? Wait. what...
What did you...

569
00:54:46.965 --> 00:54:48.032
What was that?

570
00:54:48.032 --> 00:54:49.066
Those images...

571
00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:50.133
What images?

572
00:54:50.133 --> 00:54:52.564
It’s like we said!

573
00:54:52.564 --> 00:54:53.334
It’s them!

574
00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:55.402
Sending visions
into your brain.

575
00:54:55.402 --> 00:54:56.436
They’re the aliens!

576
00:54:56.436 --> 00:54:58.713
I don’t know
what’s going on. but--

577
00:54:58.713 --> 00:55:00.374
Don’t take a step further!

578
00:55:00.374 --> 00:55:02.574
Kent. back away from them.

579
00:55:02.574 --> 00:55:04.114
Back away? Kill them!

580
00:55:04.114 --> 00:55:06.215
We’re not safe
till they’re gone!

581
00:55:08.448 --> 00:55:09.152
The music.

582
00:55:09.152 --> 00:55:10.054
It’s coming from the car.

583
00:55:10.054 --> 00:55:12.859
Damn it.
if you don’t act. I will.

584
00:55:24.596 --> 00:55:26.301
How did you do that?

585
00:55:26.301 --> 00:55:29.678
I... I don’t know.

586
00:55:39.314 --> 00:55:40.051
Your neck!

587
00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:45.485
Well. hey. looks like
the alien was me.

588
00:55:59.268 --> 00:56:00.709
He’s not human.

589
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.106
Holy shit!

590
00:56:02.106 --> 00:56:03.844
None of them are human!

591
00:56:03.844 --> 00:56:05.373
Kent. run!

592
00:56:25.162 --> 00:56:26.361
How did you...

593
00:56:26.361 --> 00:56:29.364
I don’t know.
But this feels familiar.

594
00:56:34.809 --> 00:56:36.041
Huh.

595
00:57:10.273 --> 00:57:12.044
We have to get out of here.

596
00:57:16.213 --> 00:57:17.445
Get in.

597
00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:27.026
What is going on?

598
00:57:27.026 --> 00:57:28.830
An alien invasion.

599
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.963
But what about us?

600
00:57:29.963 --> 00:57:33.494
The music.
those images.
they felt like--

601
00:57:33.494 --> 00:57:34.902
Memories.

602
00:57:34.902 --> 00:57:36.431
They felt like memories.

603
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:37.971
That’s impossible.

604
00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:41.106
Whatever is going on.

605
00:57:41.106 --> 00:57:42.976
we need to get out.

606
00:57:48.674 --> 00:57:50.885
- Argh!

607
00:58:11.796 --> 00:58:13.270
Glove compartment.

608
00:58:20.442 --> 00:58:21.245
Flare gun.

609
00:58:21.245 --> 00:58:22.642
Oil tankers
have an exhaust port.

610
00:58:22.642 --> 00:58:25.018
which keeps the gas
from sparking an explosion.

611
00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:26.778
Damage that. expose it to heat.

612
00:58:26.778 --> 00:58:28.582
and you turn the truck
into a bomb.

613
00:58:28.582 --> 00:58:30.122
How do you know all this?

614
00:58:30.122 --> 00:58:32.685
I don’t know. I just do.

615
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.495
We got one shot.

616
00:58:40.792 --> 00:58:42.266
Make it good.

617
00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:57.248
Ha-ha! Yes!

618
00:59:02.748 --> 00:59:04.354
What the hell is that?

619
01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:38.349
Kent!

620
01:00:38.514 --> 01:00:39.845
Thank God.

621
01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:42.848
you got out.

622
01:00:43.783 --> 01:00:45.191
Faraday?

623
01:00:45.884 --> 01:00:46.819
I knew you’d come.

624
01:00:46.819 --> 01:00:48.590
Smart kid like you
put it together.

625
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.263
It started with the UFO.
and here he is...

626
01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:54.431
the leader.
the alien head honcho.

627
01:00:54.431 --> 01:00:57.632
That one doesn’t look
anything like the others.

628
01:00:57.632 --> 01:00:58.567
How do you know?

629
01:00:58.567 --> 01:00:59.535
Look at it!

630
01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:02.637
Even if it’s not with them.
it doesn’t belong here.

631
01:01:02.637 --> 01:01:03.638
You have to kill it.

632
01:01:03.638 --> 01:01:06.278
It’s the only way
to stop their invasion.

633
01:01:08.214 --> 01:01:09.479
And after you do.

634
01:01:09.479 --> 01:01:11.382
we’ll put these two down.

635
01:01:11.547 --> 01:01:12.284
What?

636
01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:13.978
No! They’re not aliens.

637
01:01:13.978 --> 01:01:16.717
The minute they touched you.
you started seeing things.

638
01:01:16.717 --> 01:01:18.752
They infected you
with their alien powers.

639
01:01:18.752 --> 01:01:22.129
How else could you hit
that creature across the room?

640
01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:25.990
Tell me I’m wrong!

641
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.992
Tell me!

642
01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.699
You saw those people transform.

643
01:01:31.699 --> 01:01:33.437
We can’t trust any of them.

644
01:01:33.437 --> 01:01:35.901
We have to kill them
before they kill us.

645
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:39.003
You said you wanted
to uphold the American way.

646
01:01:39.003 --> 01:01:41.049
to prove yourself.

647
01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:45.053
This is the time! Do it!

648
01:01:59.364 --> 01:02:01.234
I don’t know what’s going on.

649
01:02:01.234 --> 01:02:03.104
I don’t know
why I’ve got these powers.

650
01:02:03.104 --> 01:02:05.997
or why I’m seeing those images.

651
01:02:08.736 --> 01:02:10.078
But I do know one thing.

652
01:02:10.078 --> 01:02:14.742
I am not going to murder people
just because I’m scared.

653
01:02:16.117 --> 01:02:18.284
That’s not the American way.

654
01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:21.518
Oh. my God.

655
01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:24.125
You’re one of them.

656
01:02:33.497 --> 01:02:34.729
No.

657
01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:51.977
He’s changing.

658
01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:54.122
Everything is.

659
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.106
It was all an illusion.

660
01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:24.350
Not everything.

661
01:03:24.581 --> 01:03:25.846
We’re real.

662
01:03:25.846 --> 01:03:27.419
And so is Faraday.

663
01:03:31.082 --> 01:03:32.424
And so is this.

664
01:03:32.424 --> 01:03:34.954
You flattened it
with your chest.

665
01:03:34.954 --> 01:03:38.694
I started feeling stronger
as soon as we came in here.

666
01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:40.993
Something about this light...

667
01:03:41.499 --> 01:03:43.237
- this...
-  Color.

668
01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:45.899
There was no color outside.

669
01:03:46.207 --> 01:03:47.637
None of us even noticed.

670
01:03:47.637 --> 01:03:49.606
And the alien leader.

671
01:03:49.606 --> 01:03:53.071
it looks like he’s more
of a prisoner than we are.

672
01:03:58.714 --> 01:04:00.254
He’s fighting it.

673
01:04:00.551 --> 01:04:02.586
Whatever the machine is doing.

674
01:04:40.052 --> 01:04:43.528
He’s being tortured.
Help me get him out of there.

675
01:04:43.528 --> 01:04:44.991
We don’t have
all the facts here.

676
01:04:44.991 --> 01:04:48.401
For all we know.
this creature is--
- No.

677
01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:49.963
Torture is wrong.

678
01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:51.602
Period.

679
01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:55.369
You’ve got quite
a grip there. Ms. Prince.

680
01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.338
I doubt it is "Ms. Prince."

681
01:05:57.338 --> 01:05:59.703
I think this identity
is every bit the illusion

682
01:05:59.703 --> 01:06:02.541
that that evil
Martian leader was.

683
01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:06.776
Ah. then it worked.

684
01:06:06.776 --> 01:06:08.107
You’ve come at last.

685
01:06:08.107 --> 01:06:09.383
Easy there. fella.

686
01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:11.176
Looks like
you’ve been
through a lot.

687
01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.354
On the contrary. Clark.

688
01:06:13.354 --> 01:06:16.324
I’ve put you. all three of you.

689
01:06:16.324 --> 01:06:17.853
through a lot.

690
01:06:18.986 --> 01:06:21.054
Bruce. Diana.

691
01:06:21.054 --> 01:06:24.288
Yes. those are your true names.

692
01:06:24.288 --> 01:06:25.795
And I know you well.

693
01:06:25.795 --> 01:06:30.162
for I’ve lived
inside your minds
for months now.

694
01:06:30.162 --> 01:06:32.406
helping create the illusions

695
01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:33.836
you’ve lived.

696
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.069
Why?

697
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:37.576
Not by choice.

698
01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:40.843
These machines usurped
my telepathic power.

699
01:06:40.843 --> 01:06:45.111
and used it to enslave you
and countless others.

700
01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:47.245
I don’t understand any of this.

701
01:06:47.245 --> 01:06:48.917
Where on earth are we?

702
01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:50.523
Not Earth.

703
01:06:51.183 --> 01:06:52.426
War World.

704
01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:55.363
An immensely ancient
planet-sized weapon

705
01:06:55.363 --> 01:06:59.191
that’s powered by the hate
and fear of its prisoners.

706
01:06:59.191 --> 01:07:02.260
I have been forced
to create realities.

707
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.098
part illusion. part technology.

708
01:07:05.098 --> 01:07:06.836
to wrench negative emotions

709
01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:10.169
from the poor souls
trapped here.

710
01:07:10.169 --> 01:07:11.302
But you helped us.

711
01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:14.239
That music.
drawing each of us here.

712
01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:17.418
Yes. After months of searching.

713
01:07:17.418 --> 01:07:20.113
I found a back door
in the system.

714
01:07:20.113 --> 01:07:23.688
I called to you
the only way I could.

715
01:07:23.688 --> 01:07:27.318
It took a dozen lifetimes.

716
01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:28.924
But you never gave up.

717
01:07:28.924 --> 01:07:33.665
I learned that from you.
as well as courage

718
01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.359
and faith.

719
01:07:35.359 --> 01:07:38.505
It was time well spent.

720
01:07:40.232 --> 01:07:43.103
He’s coming! You must hide.

721
01:07:48.207 --> 01:07:52.244
Find the zeta chamber.
Escape while you still can.

722
01:07:52.244 --> 01:07:53.751
We’ll bring you with us.

723
01:07:59.383 --> 01:08:01.286
You called us here to save you.

724
01:08:01.726 --> 01:08:02.925
At first. yes.

725
01:08:02.925 --> 01:08:04.861
I thought only of myself.

726
01:08:04.861 --> 01:08:06.731
Having lived in your minds. I--

727
01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:19.238
Good night. ladies.

728
01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:30.986
Oh. you three are adorable.

729
01:08:42.261 --> 01:08:44.230
Oh. What?

730
01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:14.964
They’re not dead.
-  No.

731
01:09:15.602 --> 01:09:18.902
In fact. I think
this one’s just being born.

732
01:09:18.902 --> 01:09:22.037
Replacements
for the ones I saw die.

733
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:25.304
They’re clones.

734
01:09:25.304 --> 01:09:27.680
Copies of people stolen
over hundreds of years

735
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.112
from various worlds.
various realities.

736
01:09:31.112 --> 01:09:33.378
So. we’re clones. too?

737
01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:34.280
No.

738
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.480
Many of the prisoners
are originals.

739
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.484
Evidently. they produce
superior hatred and terror.

740
01:09:42.629 --> 01:09:45.324
You’d make
a great detective.
Officer Wayne.

741
01:09:45.324 --> 01:09:46.358
I doubt it.

742
01:09:46.358 --> 01:09:48.734
There’s too much I don’t know.

743
01:09:48.734 --> 01:09:52.001
like how I even know
how to work this database.

744
01:09:52.199 --> 01:09:53.772
or my real name.

745
01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:56.434
or who’s watching us.

746
01:09:56.973 --> 01:09:59.646
Yes. I sense that. too.

747
01:09:59.646 --> 01:10:02.583
It must be that creature
who attacked us.

748
01:10:02.814 --> 01:10:06.081
Hmm. This looks familiar.

749
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:22.834
No escape for you. chump.

750
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:27.399
Looks like you’re gonna get
some one-on-one quality time

751
01:10:27.399 --> 01:10:28.708
with the boss man.

752
01:10:29.907 --> 01:10:32.140
Oh. you can say that again.

753
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.110
He ain’t gonna be too happy
that all of them illusions

754
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.882
you’ve been pumping
into the prisoners’ minds

755
01:10:37.882 --> 01:10:41.116
are taking a commercial break.

756
01:10:48.794 --> 01:10:50.224
No fight left in you.

757
01:10:50.224 --> 01:10:54.459
Don’t know if you even
need these brain binders.

758
01:10:57.363 --> 01:10:59.167
Well. you wanted him.

759
01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:00.872
You got him.

760
01:11:00.872 --> 01:11:02.170
Eh. what’s left of him.

761
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:07.681
The last green
Martian in the universe...

762
01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:10.310
This universe.

763
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:13.346
What a disappointment you are.

764
01:11:13.346 --> 01:11:17.790
Millennia ago.
she called to me.

765
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.254
promised me power.

766
01:11:20.584 --> 01:11:22.421
and I came.

767
01:11:23.829 --> 01:11:27.800
I killed every last Larga here.

768
01:11:29.901 --> 01:11:31.529
But where was the power?

769
01:11:31.529 --> 01:11:36.776
Oh. boy. this story again.
It never gets old.

770
01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:38.569
Now starts the key part.

771
01:11:38.569 --> 01:11:41.077
We were now one.

772
01:11:41.077 --> 01:11:45.510
The most devastating
weapon in the universe.

773
01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:48.513
a planet killer.

774
01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:53.023
But where was the key?

775
01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:56.730
Spoiler alert. not here.

776
01:11:57.258 --> 01:11:58.666
Even without it.

777
01:11:58.666 --> 01:12:02.197
we are powerful. eternal...

778
01:12:02.769 --> 01:12:07.037
thanks to the unrelenting
terror and violence

779
01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:10.139
of our treasured guests.

780
01:12:11.569 --> 01:12:13.241
But the key.

781
01:12:13.813 --> 01:12:17.212
she whispered to us.

782
01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:23.152
It took a dozen jumps
to a dozen more realities

783
01:12:23.152 --> 01:12:27.321
before we found
actual living Martians.

784
01:12:27.321 --> 01:12:31.996
Thousands of them
in dozens of universes.

785
01:12:31.996 --> 01:12:34.735
and still no key.

786
01:12:35.362 --> 01:12:40.400
Then. our faithful dog here...

787
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.534
Mercenary. Yeah.

788
01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:45.977
The last
green Martian.

789
01:12:47.407 --> 01:12:49.508
You had no key.

790
01:12:50.113 --> 01:12:52.852
You knew of no key.

791
01:12:52.852 --> 01:12:54.645
You were useful

792
01:12:55.151 --> 01:12:57.956
only as a vision-caster.

793
01:12:58.649 --> 01:13:00.255
And now...

794
01:13:02.092 --> 01:13:05.293
- ...even in that.

795
01:13:05.733 --> 01:13:07.361
you fail.

796
01:13:08.065 --> 01:13:12.234
There is but one small service

797
01:13:12.234 --> 01:13:16.040
you have yet
to render the War World.

798
01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:27.315
That creature said
you hated guns.

799
01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:31.220
Apparently he spoke the truth.

800
01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:35.092
Evidently. I’m very particular
about how I dress.

801
01:13:35.092 --> 01:13:37.765
As I must be. too.

802
01:13:41.098 --> 01:13:42.528
I like it.

803
01:13:43.232 --> 01:13:44.662
Me. too.

804
01:13:44.662 --> 01:13:46.972
Clark! It’s you!

805
01:13:46.972 --> 01:13:50.404
I don’t know why
I didn’t see it before.

806
01:13:50.734 --> 01:13:53.539
I... I’m sorry.

807
01:13:53.539 --> 01:13:55.541
I still don’t remember.

808
01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:59.116
But you’re just a baby.

809
01:13:59.578 --> 01:14:02.680
Much too young to be my Clark.

810
01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.122
There are other
differences. too.

811
01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:06.992
I see that now.

812
01:14:06.992 --> 01:14:09.291
Then you’re starting
to remember.

813
01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:11.326
I remember this.

814
01:14:11.326 --> 01:14:12.833
I remember...

815
01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:15.000
Superman.

816
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.202
Other than that.
just flashes of a life.

817
01:14:19.939 --> 01:14:21.039
I remember this room.

818
01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:24.273
The zeta chamber.
Can you take us there?

819
01:14:24.504 --> 01:14:25.846
Yes.

820
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:30.884
...J’onn J’onzz.

821
01:14:32.314 --> 01:14:36.857
All of War World
must hear your cries.

822
01:14:36.857 --> 01:14:39.057
Please. don’t!

823
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:44.425
And know

824
01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:49.001
that there is no hope
for them. either.

825
01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:51.971
On your feet.

826
01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:55.601
It’s not as good
if we can’t see your face.

827
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.010
He’s gonna finish you off. now.

828
01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.079
I’m gonna let you get
one good shot in.

829
01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:04.049
Go out in a blaze of glory.

830
01:15:04.049 --> 01:15:05.512
Make it count.

831
01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:32.209
I could have just punched him.

832
01:15:32.836 --> 01:15:33.980
I wanted to see if I was right

833
01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.246
about what those things
were for.

834
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:38.083
I was.

835
01:15:42.252 --> 01:15:43.682
Yes.

836
01:15:44.221 --> 01:15:45.783
this is how I arrived here.

837
01:15:45.783 --> 01:15:50.524
I was bound... with this.

838
01:15:51.228 --> 01:15:52.328
It’s hard to believe a rope

839
01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:54.231
could hold someone
as strong as you.

840
01:15:54.231 --> 01:15:56.860
I don’t think
it’s an ordinary rope.

841
01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.863
These controls
are surprisingly intuitive.

842
01:15:59.863 --> 01:16:00.864
Where will it take us?

843
01:16:00.864 --> 01:16:02.833
Virtually anywhere
we want to go.

844
01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:08.773
Prisoners of War World.
Mongul speaks.

845
01:16:09.444 --> 01:16:12.645
Observe this being.

846
01:16:13.415 --> 01:16:15.648
He is stronger than you.

847
01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:19.058
He is wiser than you.

848
01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:23.491
Watch him die at our hands.

849
01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:28.562
And know. there is no hope.

850
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:35.470
If we want to leave.
this is the time.

851
01:16:39.672 --> 01:16:41.080
Understand.

852
01:16:41.575 --> 01:16:45.612
there’s an army of warriors
between us and him.

853
01:16:46.613 --> 01:16:49.814
I’m strangely comfortable
with those odds.

854
01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:52.157
I’d say we’ve
been in situations

855
01:16:52.157 --> 01:16:53.653
like this before.

856
01:16:55.061 --> 01:16:56.425
I was just gonna send you guys.

857
01:16:56.425 --> 01:16:58.295
and then go back and save him.

858
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:13.277
So ends
the very last green Martian.

859
01:17:13.277 --> 01:17:14.212
Whoa. that’s it?

860
01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.478
I thought
you were gonna
say a little more.

861
01:17:16.478 --> 01:17:20.251
Because you are useful to us.

862
01:17:20.251 --> 01:17:21.252
Lobo.

863
01:17:21.252 --> 01:17:24.849
we give you
a measure of freedom.

864
01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:27.489
- but do not--
-  Like...

865
01:17:27.489 --> 01:17:30.096
we thought this
ugly green Martian

866
01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:32.461
would give us
the key to War World

867
01:17:32.461 --> 01:17:35.431
so we could actually
fire the damn thing

868
01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:41.239
instead of just
sitting on our ass
for 10.000 years.

869
01:17:42.504 --> 01:17:43.208
Whoa!

870
01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:45.177
Uh. just yanking
your chain a little.

871
01:17:45.177 --> 01:17:48.312
I’m all about breaking
the awkward tension.

872
01:17:48.312 --> 01:17:54.021
Your screams
will inspire our workers

873
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:57.519
for decades. fool.

874
01:17:57.519 --> 01:17:59.356
Oh. come on. boss man.

875
01:17:59.356 --> 01:18:01.028
I didn’t mean nothing.

876
01:18:01.028 --> 01:18:02.524
I just thought
we needed to stop

877
01:18:02.524 --> 01:18:04.361
and smell the flowers for once.

878
01:18:04.361 --> 01:18:07.826
You know. slow things down.

879
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:09.564
Why?

880
01:18:10.631 --> 01:18:11.665
Lord Mongul.

881
01:18:11.665 --> 01:18:14.338
there’s a disturbance
on level 12. citadel ring.

882
01:18:14.338 --> 01:18:17.572
Another
tedious rebellion.

883
01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:20.212
Send an enforcement detail
to all levels.

884
01:18:20.212 --> 01:18:24.480
Reports of a security division
being overwhelmed on level ten.

885
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.514
Close battle gates

886
01:18:25.514 --> 01:18:27.582
and scramble
insurrection units.

887
01:18:27.582 --> 01:18:31.322
Showing malfunction
on level eight battle gate.

888
01:18:31.817 --> 01:18:32.686
Malfunction?

889
01:18:32.686 --> 01:18:36.063
It’s been
torn out of its tracks.

890
01:18:36.063 --> 01:18:38.527
All communications
lost on level four.

891
01:18:38.527 --> 01:18:39.759
Lower defensive bulkheads.

892
01:18:39.759 --> 01:18:43.136
-  Come.
-  Additional breaches
on levels six and seven.

893
01:18:43.136 --> 01:18:46.436
Security divisions
are being overrun.

894
01:18:46.436 --> 01:18:48.031
Power outage on level two.

895
01:18:48.031 --> 01:18:52.541
Defensive bulkheads
raised by outside force.

896
01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:56.776
Yeah. that’d be
Wonder Woman
or Superman.

897
01:18:56.776 --> 01:18:57.711
But not Batman.

898
01:18:57.711 --> 01:18:59.581
That would screw up
his lower back.

899
01:18:59.581 --> 01:19:02.221
I had you kill them.

900
01:19:02.914 --> 01:19:03.717
Kill them?

901
01:19:03.717 --> 01:19:05.884
I thought you said "Free them."

902
01:19:05.884 --> 01:19:09.195
Oh. well. honest mistake.
Could happen to anybody.

903
01:19:09.195 --> 01:19:12.429
But I think it’s great
we’re finally talking.

904
01:19:18.897 --> 01:19:20.173
Treachery.

905
01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:21.405
I know. right?

906
01:19:21.405 --> 01:19:23.539
You’d think you could
trust a paid killer.

907
01:19:23.539 --> 01:19:25.805
and not expect
he’d totally try to kill you

908
01:19:25.805 --> 01:19:29.644
and take over the most
badass weapon in the universe.

909
01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:32.317
But. oh. well!

910
01:19:36.156 --> 01:19:37.421
Yeah!

911
01:19:38.587 --> 01:19:40.853
Arm yourselves.

912
01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:52.964
There he is.

913
01:19:52.964 --> 01:19:55.307
At the foot of the leader.
-  On it.

914
01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:04.481
Kill them.

915
01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.856
You die now.

916
01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:24.528
Yeah! Don’t take no shit
from those Martians!

917
01:21:28.598 --> 01:21:31.161
You can’t kill us.

918
01:21:31.161 --> 01:21:37.739
We are linked...
War World and Mongul.

919
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:40.478
We shall see.

920
01:21:44.845 --> 01:21:47.716
What are you doing?
He’s still breathing!

921
01:21:47.716 --> 01:21:49.146
Frag him!

922
01:21:49.619 --> 01:21:51.390
You owe me that Martian.

923
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.216
I put in that back door.

924
01:21:53.216 --> 01:21:54.294
I freed you!

925
01:21:54.294 --> 01:21:58.661
And who do you think
planted this idea in your mind?

926
01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:09.903
The entire planet
is coming through that door.

927
01:22:09.903 --> 01:22:12.235
We can’t hold them off
for long.

928
01:22:12.235 --> 01:22:13.203
Come with us.

929
01:22:13.203 --> 01:22:16.514
I warned you to escape
while you could. Wonder Woman.

930
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:25.292
Start.

931
01:22:30.187 --> 01:22:34.400
The legend
you heard was true. Mongul.

932
01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.632
The Largas did indeed

933
01:22:35.632 --> 01:22:38.635
hide the key
among the Martians.

934
01:22:38.635 --> 01:22:41.440
Mars. locked in
an eternal civil war...

935
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.905
-  ...knowing
we would never work together.

936
01:22:44.905 --> 01:22:47.270
the Largas secretly
hid half the key

937
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:49.811
in the DNA
of the white Martians.

938
01:22:49.811 --> 01:22:52.319
The other half in the green.

939
01:22:52.319 --> 01:22:54.277
Neither side knew.

940
01:22:54.277 --> 01:22:59.084
No. War World is ours.

941
01:22:59.084 --> 01:23:01.658
Frag you! It’s mine!

942
01:23:02.362 --> 01:23:04.397
Until only one Martian

943
01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:06.025
of either race survived.

944
01:23:07.532 --> 01:23:10.029
I am the last of my kind.

945
01:23:10.029 --> 01:23:15.408
Eventually.
you would exterminate
these whites as well.

946
01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:17.344
And then you would know.

947
01:23:18.807 --> 01:23:22.877
War World is the universe’s
ultimate weapon.

948
01:23:23.108 --> 01:23:26.045
You will never wield it.

949
01:24:01.047 --> 01:24:03.390
J’onn. what are you doing?

950
01:24:08.461 --> 01:24:11.794
What must be done. Superman.

951
01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:32.914
I don’t like the look of this.

952
01:24:32.914 --> 01:24:34.817
A weapon of such horror

953
01:24:34.817 --> 01:24:37.985
must not be allowed
to roam the multiverse

954
01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:41.351
causing endless
death and destruction.

955
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:44.530
Someday. it may
fall into worse hands

956
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.862
even than Mongul’s.

957
01:24:52.472 --> 01:24:54.936
He set War World
to self-destruct.

958
01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:57.939
J’onn. you can’t.
They’re all prisoners...

959
01:24:57.939 --> 01:25:00.612
the people of Skartaris.
even the clones.

960
01:25:00.612 --> 01:25:03.340
So I thought
when I arrived.

961
01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.585
But I have spent time
in their minds.

962
01:25:06.585 --> 01:25:07.850
War World’s algorithm

963
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:10.820
simply gives them
what they think they want.

964
01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.594
then leads them deeper
into their hatred and terror.

965
01:25:19.829 --> 01:25:21.996
You will fail.

966
01:25:21.996 --> 01:25:28.266
There is not fear or rage
enough on all War World

967
01:25:28.266 --> 01:25:30.675
to do what you plan.

968
01:25:30.675 --> 01:25:32.072
You are right.

969
01:25:32.072 --> 01:25:36.516
But the richest vein
remains untapped.

970
01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:53.995
The zeta chamber!

971
01:25:53.995 --> 01:25:55.029
There’s no time.

972
01:26:05.336 --> 01:26:07.580
The three of you are needed.

973
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.880
You will come with me. Now.

974
01:26:31.494 --> 01:26:35.465
A handful of lives
on a single planet...

975
01:26:35.465 --> 01:26:36.675
that is nothing

976
01:26:36.675 --> 01:26:40.173
compared to the crisis
that is to come.

977
01:26:40.173 --> 01:26:42.439
The absolute annihilation

978
01:26:42.439 --> 01:26:46.377
of everything. everywhere.
