00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.800
- We have
an active shooter!

4
00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:30.598
We have an active shooter!

5
00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.937
- I got one down.
gunshot wound to the leg.

6
00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:39.847
- We have
multiple casualties!

7
00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.680
We have gunmen at
the medical check.

8
00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.081
Multiple casualties!

9
00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:49.088
- Turning and turning

10
00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.387
in the widening gyre.

11
00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:55.657
The falcon cannot
hear the falconer.

12
00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.691
Things fall apart.

13
00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.099
The center cannot hold.

14
00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:04.804
Mere anarchy is
loosed upon the world.

15
00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.537
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed.

16
00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:09.936
and everywhere

17
00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:14.148
the ceremony of
innocence is drowned.

18
00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:18.111
The best lack all conviction.

19
00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.854
while the worst

20
00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.684
are full of
passionate intensity.

21
00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.920
Surely some
revelation is at hand.

22
00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:30.857
Surely the Second
Coming is at hand.

23
00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:08.697
- Report.

24
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.735
- Say the knowledge.

25
00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.214
- The merciless Macdonwald.

26
00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:25.615
The multiplying villainies
of nature swarm upon him.

27
00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:28.387
And fortune.

28
00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:34.025
on his damned quarrel smiling

29
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.329
showed like a devil's whore.

30
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:38.628
But all's too weak

31
00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.363
for brave Macbeth.

32
00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.470
with his brandished steel.

33
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.606
which smoked with
bloody execution.

34
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:56.283
He unseamed him from
the nave to the chaps

35
00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:01.486
and fixed his head
upon our battlement.

36
00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:14.228
- Worthy.

37
00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:15.962
- A fresh assault!

38
00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:23.343
I bathe in reeking wounds.

39
00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.613
My gashes cry for help.

40
00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:35.289
- Get him surgeons.

41
00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:36.818
- Aye.

42
00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:11.985
- When shall we
three meet again?

43
00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:16.528
In thunder.
lightning or in rain?

44
00:04:17.328 --> 00:04:19.658
When the hurlyburly's done.

45
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.827
when the battle's lost and won.

46
00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:24.569
that will be ere the
set of sun. where?

47
00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:29.406
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

48
00:04:29.442 --> 00:04:32.577
hover through the
fog and filthy air.

49
00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:36.749
Where hast thou been. sister?

50
00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.319
Killing swine.

51
00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:41.854
And munched and
munched and munched.

52
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.393
Like a rat without a tail.
I'll do. I'll do. I'll do.

53
00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:53.931
A wind.

54
00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:03.410
- Ross!

55
00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:07.674
- A haste looks
through his eyes.

56
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.344
It seems to speak
things strange.

57
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.084
- God save the King.

58
00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:13.149
- Whence camest thou?

59
00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:14.421
- A dismal conflict.

60
00:05:15.022 --> 00:05:16.852
The victory fell on us.

61
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.631
- Mmm.

62
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.801
No more the thane of
Cawdor shall deceive.

63
00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:35.403
Go pronounce his present death.

64
00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.505
and...

65
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.374
with his title. greet Macbeth.

66
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.375
- I'll see it done.

67
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.812
- What he hath lost.

68
00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.650
noble Macbeth hath won.

69
00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:51.392
Boom.

70
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.597
- The second coming.

71
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.964
Hardly are those words out

72
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.506
when a vast image
out of Spiritus Mundi

73
00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:09.509
Somewhere in sands of the desert

74
00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:14.181
a shape with lion body
and the head of a man.

75
00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:17.683
a gaze blank and
pitiless as the sun.

76
00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:22.586
is moving its slow
thighs. while all about it

77
00:06:22.621 --> 00:06:26.024
reel shadows of the
indignant desert birds.

78
00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:29.895
The darkness drops again.

79
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.025
but now I know

80
00:06:32.298 --> 00:06:35.060
that 20 centuries of stony sleep

81
00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:38.098
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle.

82
00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:46.442
- So foul

83
00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:48.779
and fair a day I have not seen.

84
00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.686
- And what rough beast

85
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:02.460
its hour come round at last.

86
00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:06.060
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born?

from our royal master thanks.

115
00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:06.950

thee thane of Cawdor.

116
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.154
Hail. most worthy thane.

117
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.587
For it is thine.

118
00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:14.826
- What?

119
00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.493
What?

Can a devil speak true?

121

00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:28.672
Why do you dress me
in borrowed robes?

123
00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:32.408
- He labored in his

124
00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:33.880

126
00:09:43.654 --> 00:09:45.219

127
00:10:57.565 --> 00:10:59.563
- Have we eaten
on the insane root

128
00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:01.196

129
00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:06.168
- Your children shall be kings.

130
00:11:12.313 --> 00:11:13.439
- You shall be king.

131
00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:11.068
Duncan comes hither tonight.

132
00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:26.314
- And when goes hence?

133
00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:30.318
- Tomorrow. as he purposes.

134
00:12:42.934 --> 00:12:46.235
- O. never shall
sun that morrow see.

135
00:12:54.748 --> 00:12:56.949
Your face. my
thane. is as a book

136
00:12:57.883 --> 00:13:00.150
where men may read
strange matters.

137
00:13:03.523 --> 00:13:05.023
To beguile the time.

138
00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:07.355
look like the time.

139
00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:11.859
bear welcome in your eye.

140
00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:14.362
your hand. your tongue.

141
00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:18.432
look like the innocent flower.

142
00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:23.309
but be the serpent under it.

143
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.956
Yet I do fear thy nature.

144
00:13:39.926 --> 00:13:42.120
It is too full the
milk of human kindness

145
00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.227
to catch the nearest way.

146
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.396
Thou wouldst be great.

147
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.166
Art not without ambition.

148
00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:53.566
but without the illness
should attend it.

149
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:04.544
Hie thee hither.

150
00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:10.419
that I may pour my
spirits in thine ear

151
00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:13.586
and chastise with the
valor of my tongue

152
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.623
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

153
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.037
The raven. himself.

154
00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:27.435
is hoarse

155
00:14:29.206 --> 00:14:33.138
that croaks the fatal
entrance of Duncan

156
00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.541
under my battlements.

157
00:14:39.517 --> 00:14:40.946
Come.

158
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.450
you spirits.

159
00:14:43.723 --> 00:14:46.391
Attend on mortal thoughts.

160
00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.961
unsex me here.

161
00:14:49.258 --> 00:14:52.191
and fill me from
the crown to the toe

162
00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:55.529
top-full of direst cruelty.

163
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.467
Make thick my blood.

164
00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:02.435
Stop up the access and
passage to remorse.

165
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.412
that no compunctious
visitings of nature

166
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:07.407
shake my fell purpose.

167
00:15:07.442 --> 00:15:11.149
nor make peace between
the effect and it.

168
00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:15.785
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall.

169
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.251
you murdering ministers.

170
00:15:17.286 --> 00:15:19.790
wherever in your
sightless substances

171
00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:22.023
you wait on nature's mischief.

172
00:15:22.058 --> 00:15:25.191
Come. thick night. and pall thee

173
00:15:25.226 --> 00:15:27.196
in the dunnest smoke of hell.

174
00:15:27.232 --> 00:15:31.167
that my keen knife see
not the wound it makes.

175
00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:34.169
nor heaven peep through
the blanket of the dark.

176
00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:39.441
to cry "Hold. hold!"

177
00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:49.055
- If it were done
when 'tis done.

178
00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:52.520
then 'twere well it
were done quickly.

179
00:15:55.495 --> 00:15:56.460
If the...

180
00:15:57.197 --> 00:16:02.398
assassination could trammel
up the consequences.

181
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.704
and catch with his
surcease success

182
00:16:07.739 --> 00:16:09.471
that but this blow

183
00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:13.541
might be the be-all

184
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.149
and the end-all here.

185
00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:19.514
but here.

186
00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:23.254
upon this bank
and shoal of time.

187
00:16:25.187 --> 00:16:26.620
we'll jump the life to come.

188
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:37.298
But in these cases we
still have judgment here.

189
00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:41.540
that we but teach
bloody instruction.

190
00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:43.307
which being taught.

191
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:47.443
returns to plague the inventor.

192
00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:55.121
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

193
00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:59.251
This even-handed justice

194
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.322
commends the ingredients

195
00:17:01.357 --> 00:17:04.827
of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

196
00:17:12.707 --> 00:17:15.438
- Is execution done on Cawdor?

197
00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.606
- Nothing in his life became him

198
00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.345
like the leaving it.

199
00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:27.579
- There's no art to find

200
00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:30.688
the mind's construction
in the face.

201
00:17:30.723 --> 00:17:33.621
He was a gentleman

202
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.855
on whom I built
an absolute trust.

203
00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.569
My worthy Cawdor.

204
00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:12.395
- He's here in double trust.

205
00:18:12.431 --> 00:18:16.736
first. as I am his kinsman
and his subject strong.

206
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:19.568
both against the deed. then.

207
00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:22.606
as his host.

208
00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:25.403
who should against his
murderer shut the door.

209
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.510
not bear the knife myself.

210
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:43.557
Besides.

211
00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:48.531
this Duncan hath borne
his faculties so meek.

212
00:18:49.466 --> 00:18:52.731
hath been so clear
in his great office.

213
00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:56.704
that his virtues will
plead like angels.

214
00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:58.706
trumpet-tongued.

215
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:03.414
against the deep damnation

216
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.450
of his taking-off.

217
00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:09.448
And pity.

218
00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:12.658
like a naked new-born babe.

219
00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.294
striding the blast.

220
00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.357
or heaven's cherubim.

221
00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:22.730
horsed upon the sightless
couriers of the air.

222
00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:28.607
shall blow the horrid deed

223
00:19:28.643 --> 00:19:29.737
in every eye.

224
00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:33.279
that tears

225
00:19:35.013 --> 00:19:36.810
shall drown the wind.

226
00:20:25.429 --> 00:20:27.828
- This castle hath
a pleasant seat.

227
00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.197
The air...

228
00:20:30.966 --> 00:20:35.935
freely and nimbly recommends
itself to our gentle senses.

229
00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:40.445
My fair and gentle hostess.

230
00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:44.845
we are your guests tonight.

231
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:31.985
- Macbeth!

232
00:22:42.197 --> 00:22:43.062
Macbeth!

233
00:22:48.335 --> 00:22:49.409
Macbeth!

234
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:52.676
Macbe...

235
00:22:54.508 --> 00:22:56.180
Sleep no more.

236
00:22:56.215 --> 00:22:58.378
Macbeth has murdered sleep.

237
00:23:01.022 --> 00:23:03.385
Macbeth has murdered sleep.

238
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.689
Macbeth shall sleep no more!

239
00:23:11.758 --> 00:23:14.159
Macbeth shall sleep no more.

240
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.102
Ah. ah. ah!

241
00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:34.515
Oh. fuck.

242
00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:34.074
- The king's a-bed.

243
00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:37.077
He hath been in
unusual pleasure.

244
00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:40.884
This diamond he greets
your wife withal

245
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.986
by the name of most
kind hostess. and...

246
00:25:00.103 --> 00:25:05.545
- False face must hide what
the false heart doth know.

247
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:14.345
- I dreamt last night
of the weird sisters.

248
00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:17.117
To you. they have
shown some truth.

249
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:20.355
- I think not of them.

250
00:25:49.384 --> 00:25:50.249
How now?

251
00:25:52.487 --> 00:25:53.351
What news?

252
00:25:56.929 --> 00:26:00.028
- He has almost supped. why
have you left the chamber?

253
00:26:00.794 --> 00:26:02.162
- Hath he asked for me?

254
00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:05.935
- Know you not he has?

255
00:26:09.142 --> 00:26:12.172
- We will proceed

256
00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:16.113
no further with this business.

257
00:26:20.952 --> 00:26:24.349
- Was the hope drunk wherein
you dressed yourself?

258
00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:27.891
Hath it slept since?

259
00:26:29.893 --> 00:26:33.429
And wakes it now. to
look so green and pale

260
00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.195
at what it did so freely?

261
00:26:38.605 --> 00:26:42.202
From this time. such
I account thy love.

262
00:26:44.309 --> 00:26:45.844
Art thou afraid

263
00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:49.577
to be the same in
thine own act and valor

264
00:26:49.612 --> 00:26:51.343
as thou art in desire?

265
00:26:54.786 --> 00:26:57.156
Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteems

266
00:26:57.191 --> 00:26:58.655
to the ornament of life.

267
00:26:58.691 --> 00:27:02.059
and live a coward
in thine own esteem.

268
00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:06.164
letting "I dare not'"
wait upon "I would?"

269
00:27:06.199 --> 00:27:07.865
- Prithee. peace!

270
00:27:08.997 --> 00:27:11.769
I dare do all that
may become a man

271
00:27:11.805 --> 00:27:15.504
who dares do more is none!

272
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.169
- What beast was it. then.

273
00:27:17.204 --> 00:27:20.174
that made you break
this enterprise to me?

274
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.785
When you durst do it.
then you were a man.

275
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.993
I have given suck.

276
00:27:37.826 --> 00:27:40.926
and know how tender it is

277
00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:44.132
to love the babe that milks me.

278
00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:48.406
I would.

279
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:50.873
while it was smiling in my face.

280
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:54.004
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums.

281
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.208
and dashed the brains out.

282
00:27:56.243 --> 00:28:00.412
had I so sworn as you
have done to this!

283
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:23.204
- If we should fail?

284
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.074
- We fail.

285
00:28:27.913 --> 00:28:30.875
But screw your courage
to the sticking-place.

286
00:28:30.911 --> 00:28:32.312
and we'll not fail.

287
00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:38.719
When Duncan is asleep.

288
00:28:38.754 --> 00:28:40.320
his two chamberlains.

289
00:28:42.696 --> 00:28:45.127
will I with wine and
wassail so convince

290
00:28:46.263 --> 00:28:51.232
that memory. the warder of
the brain. shall be a fume.

291
00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:53.806
and when in swinish sleep

292
00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:58.074
their drenched natures
lie as in a death.

293
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:04.679
What cannot you and I perform
against the unguarded Duncan?

294
00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:24.199
- Is this a dagger
I see before me.

295
00:29:26.506 --> 00:29:29.437
the handle towards my hand?

296
00:29:29.472 --> 00:29:30.370
Come.

297
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.241
let me clutch thee.

298
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.410
I have thee not.

299
00:29:38.716 --> 00:29:40.853
and yet I see thee still.

300
00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:44.384
Art thou not.

301
00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:47.387
fatal vision.

302
00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:53.794
sensible to feeling as
to sight or art thou but

303
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:57.397
a dagger of the mind.

304
00:29:58.635 --> 00:30:01.399
a false creation.

305
00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:06.879
proceeding from the
heat-oppressed brain?

306
00:30:10.381 --> 00:30:11.378
Oh.

307
00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:14.714
I...

308
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.548
see thee yet.

309
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.924
in form

310
00:30:19.886 --> 00:30:21.025
as palpable

311
00:30:22.129 --> 00:30:22.994
as this

312
00:30:24.023 --> 00:30:25.458
which now I draw.

313
00:30:26.828 --> 00:30:28.395
And on thy blade

314
00:30:30.402 --> 00:30:31.398
and dudgeon

315
00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:35.072
gouts of blood.

316
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.638
which was not so before.

317
00:31:18.781 --> 00:31:19.919
- My husband.

318
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.358
- I have done the deed.

319
00:31:31.498 --> 00:31:34.932
Didst I hear a noise?

320
00:31:34.968 --> 00:31:38.135
- I heard the owl scream
and the crickets cry.

321
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:39.800
Did not you speak?

322
00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:41.303
- When?
- Now.

323
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:45.342
- As I descended?

324
00:31:45.377 --> 00:31:46.242
- Aye.

325
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.117
- This is a sorry sight.

326
00:31:54.382 --> 00:31:57.484
- A foolish thought.
to say a sorry sight.

327
00:31:58.656 --> 00:31:59.519
- There's one...

328
00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:05.195
did laugh in his sleep.
and one cried "murder"

329
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.128
that they did wake each
other. I stood and heard them.

330
00:32:09.163 --> 00:32:10.262
but they did say their prayers.

331
00:32:10.298 --> 00:32:12.499
and addressed them
again to sleep.

332
00:32:13.233 --> 00:32:15.073
- There are two lodged together.

333
00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:19.944
- One cried "God bless
us" and the other. "Amen"

334
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.913
as they had seen me with
these hangman's hands.

335
00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:24.177
Listening their fear.
I could not say "Amen."

336
00:32:24.213 --> 00:32:26.150
when they did say
"God bless us!"

337
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:28.647
- Consider it not so deeply.

338
00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:35.193
- But wherefore could
not I pronounce "Amen?"

339
00:32:35.228 --> 00:32:39.658
I had most need of blessing.
and "Amen" stuck in my throat!

340
00:32:43.537 --> 00:32:44.501
- Sleep no more.

341
00:32:44.537 --> 00:32:45.404
- Sleep no more.

342
00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:46.465
It's just murder.

343
00:32:46.501 --> 00:32:49.506
Sleep no more.
- Before I heard a voice cry.

344
00:32:49.542 --> 00:32:51.406
"Sleep no more!

345
00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:53.639
"Macbeth does murder sleep."

346
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:58.143
- Macbeth does murder sleep.

347
00:32:58.178 --> 00:32:59.579
- The innocent sleep.

348
00:33:01.314 --> 00:33:04.122
Sleep that knits up the raveled

349
00:33:05.525 --> 00:33:06.586
sleeve of care.

350
00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:10.491
The death of each day's life.

351
00:33:11.459 --> 00:33:14.792
sore labor's bath
balm of hurt minds.

352
00:33:17.363 --> 00:33:20.171
great nature's second course.

353
00:33:21.004 --> 00:33:23.540
chief nourisher in life's feast.

354
00:33:23.576 --> 00:33:25.141
"Sleep no more."

355
00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:29.343
steady cries. "Macbeth
hath murdered sleep!

356
00:33:29.378 --> 00:33:33.478
"Sleep no more. Macbeth
hath murdered sleep

357
00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:37.087
"and therefore.
Macbeth shall sleep

358
00:33:37.122 --> 00:33:38.855
"no more!"
- Why did you bring the dagger

359
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:40.888
from the place?

360
00:33:40.923 --> 00:33:42.622
It must lie there.

361
00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:47.798
Give me the dagger.

362
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:31.473
- Bring forth men-children only.

363
00:34:36.947 --> 00:34:38.414
- The king was murdered.

364
00:34:39.614 --> 00:34:42.450
Those of his chamber. as
it seemed. had done it.

365
00:34:42.486 --> 00:34:44.887
Their hands and faces
were an badged with blood.

366
00:34:44.922 --> 00:34:46.552
so were their daggers.

367
00:34:46.587 --> 00:34:49.359
which unwiped we found
upon their pillows.

368
00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:54.133
- I do repent me of my fury.

369
00:34:55.734 --> 00:34:56.762
I did kill him.

370
00:35:00.135 --> 00:35:01.503
- Wherefore did you so?

371
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:06.509
- Here lay Duncan.

372
00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:09.676
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

373
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:11.744
There. the murderers.

374
00:35:12.982 --> 00:35:14.252
who could refrain.

375
00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:16.749
that had a heart to love?

376
00:35:19.293 --> 00:35:22.693
- Let us meet to question
this most bloody piece of work

377
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:23.723
to know it further.

378
00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:27.661
The great hand of God stand I.

379
00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:30.263
against the undivulged pretense

380
00:35:30.298 --> 00:35:31.398
I fight of treasonous malice.

381
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.870
- Malcolm and
Donalbain. his two sons.

382
00:35:33.906 --> 00:35:36.206
are stolen away and fled.

383
00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:39.871
which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

384
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.448
- It seems most like
the sovereignty will

385
00:35:47.149 --> 00:35:48.550
- I am already named

386
00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:51.190
and...

387
00:35:53.321 --> 00:35:55.557
gone to Scone to be invested.

388
00:36:04.232 --> 00:36:06.497
Ride you this afternoon?

389
00:36:06.532 --> 00:36:08.069
- Aye. my good lord.

390
00:36:08.104 --> 00:36:09.538
- Is it far. your ride?

391
00:36:09.573 --> 00:36:12.007
- As far. my lord.
as will fill up the time

392
00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:13.811
'twixt this and supper.

393
00:36:13.846 --> 00:36:16.408
- Fail not our feast.

394
00:36:16.443 --> 00:36:18.915
- My lord. I will not.

395
00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:33.295
- I shall
drain him dry as hay

396
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.263
and sleep shall
neither night nor day.

397
00:36:36.298 --> 00:36:38.364
Hang upon his pent-house lid.

398
00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:40.602
he shall live a man forbid.

399
00:36:56.118 --> 00:36:57.652
Macbeth doth come.

400
00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:00.087
♪ Macbeth ♪

401
00:37:00.122 --> 00:37:02.354

403
00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:13.272
- Oooooo.

404
00:37:14.038 --> 00:37:16.273
Whence is that knocking?

405
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:19.971
How is it with me. that
every noise appalls me?

406
00:37:22.178 --> 00:37:23.843
What hands are these?

407
00:37:24.683 --> 00:37:25.582
Ah!

408
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:26.312
Ah!

409
00:37:26.348 --> 00:37:28.346
They pluck out mine eyes!

410
00:37:30.852 --> 00:37:36.295
Will all great Neptune's
oceans wash clean these hands?

411
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:37.287
No!

412
00:37:38.057 --> 00:37:42.359
This. my hand. will rather
the multitudinous seas

413
00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:44.528
in incarnadine.

414
00:37:44.564 --> 00:37:47.064
making the green one red.

415
00:37:52.878 --> 00:37:53.637
Knock. knock.

416
00:37:53.673 --> 00:37:54.572
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

417
00:37:54.607 --> 00:37:56.876
- In the name of Beelzebub.

418
00:37:57.917 --> 00:37:59.779
- Here's a farmer...

419
00:37:59.815 --> 00:38:03.685
that hanged himself on
the expectation of plenty.

420
00:38:10.698 --> 00:38:11.589
Knock. knock.

421
00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:12.996
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

422
00:38:13.031 --> 00:38:14.692
- Here's an equivocator.

423
00:38:14.728 --> 00:38:17.633
that could swear
in both the scales

424
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.768
against either scale.

425
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.870
Who committed treason.

426
00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:28.677
yet could not
equivocate to heaven.

427
00:38:42.222 --> 00:38:43.661
Knock.

428
00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:45.029
knock.

429
00:38:45.065 --> 00:38:47.262
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

430
00:38:47.297 --> 00:38:50.094
- Here's an English tailor.

431
00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:52.002
- Snip. snip. snip. snip.
- Snip. snip. snip. snip.

432
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.398
- Snip. snip. snip. snip.

433
00:38:55.505 --> 00:38:58.905
- Here. you will
roast your goose.

434
00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:02.645
What are you?

435
00:39:07.847 --> 00:39:10.983
But this place is
too cold for hell.

436
00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:36.811
- To be thus...

437
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:39.517
is nothing.

438
00:39:42.021 --> 00:39:43.114
But to be safely thus.

439
00:39:58.838 --> 00:39:59.702
Our fears

440
00:40:00.466 --> 00:40:01.539
in Banquo

441
00:40:02.402 --> 00:40:04.003
stick deep.

442
00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:08.139
And in his royalty of nature

443
00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:13.045
reigns that which
would be feared.

444
00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:16.217
'Tis much he dares.

445
00:40:30.267 --> 00:40:32.163
There is none but he

446
00:40:33.138 --> 00:40:34.803
whose being I do fear.

447
00:40:38.604 --> 00:40:39.676
And. under him.

448
00:40:40.808 --> 00:40:43.713
my Genius is rebuked.
as. it is said.

449
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:46.749
Mark Antony's was

450
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.784
by Caesar.

451
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.323
He chid the sisters

452
00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:38.067
when first they put the
name of king upon me.

453
00:41:38.102 --> 00:41:40.070
and bad him

454
00:41:40.908 --> 00:41:41.771
talk to them.

455
00:41:47.545 --> 00:41:52.782
Then prophet-like.

456
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:54.685
they hailed him.

457
00:41:55.386 --> 00:41:58.557
Father to a line of kings.

458
00:41:59.422 --> 00:42:01.359
Hmm?

459
00:42:01.394 --> 00:42:06.026
And put a barren
scepter in my grip.

460
00:42:07.028 --> 00:42:11.031
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand.

461
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.334
Hmm?

462
00:42:13.369 --> 00:42:14.634
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

463
00:42:14.669 --> 00:42:19.207
No son of mine succeeding...

464
00:42:20.573 --> 00:42:21.877
If it be so.

465
00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:27.115
for Banquo's son

466
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.447
have I

467
00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:29.819
filed my mind.

468
00:42:34.257 --> 00:42:35.253
For them.

469
00:42:36.063 --> 00:42:37.695
the gracious Duncan

470
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:39.961
have I murdered

471
00:42:43.135 --> 00:42:44.295
only for them

472
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.704
and mine eternal jewel

473
00:42:47.467 --> 00:42:48.332
given

474
00:42:50.474 --> 00:42:52.072
to the common enemy of man!

475
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.409
To make them kings!

476
00:42:57.444 --> 00:42:59.180
The seed

477
00:42:59.216 --> 00:43:01.017
of Banquo

478
00:43:01.052 --> 00:43:02.349
kings!

479
00:43:21.134 --> 00:43:25.069
Was it not yesterday
we spoke together?

480
00:43:25.104 --> 00:43:27.041
- It was. so please
your highness.

481
00:43:29.015 --> 00:43:29.879
- Well then.

482
00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:32.076
now.

483
00:43:32.111 --> 00:43:34.114
Have you considered
of my speeches?

484
00:43:36.156 --> 00:43:38.151
Know that it was he

485
00:43:39.121 --> 00:43:42.659
in the times past which
held you so under fortune.

486
00:43:42.695 --> 00:43:46.223
which you thought had
been our innocent self.

487
00:43:46.259 --> 00:43:49.100
this I made good to you
in our last conference.

488
00:43:49.135 --> 00:43:50.630
"Thus did Banquo."

489
00:43:50.666 --> 00:43:52.198
- You made it known to us.

490
00:43:52.965 --> 00:43:54.869
- I did so. and went further.

491
00:43:54.904 --> 00:43:56.768
which is now our point
of second meeting.

492
00:43:56.804 --> 00:44:01.142
Do you find your patience

493
00:44:01.177 --> 00:44:04.611
so predominant in your nature
that you can let this go?

494
00:44:04.646 --> 00:44:06.810
- We are men. my liege.

495
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:10.981
- Aye.

496
00:44:11.016 --> 00:44:13.186
In the catalog ye go for men.

497
00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:16.959
as hounds and greyhounds.

498
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.764
mongrels. spaniels.

499
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.060
curs. shoughs.

500
00:44:22.095 --> 00:44:24.835
water-rugs. demi-wolves.
are clept...

501
00:44:28.604 --> 00:44:30.808
By the name of dogs.

502
00:44:33.513 --> 00:44:35.205
I will put that
business in your bosoms.

503
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.642
whose execution
takes your enemy off.

504
00:44:39.245 --> 00:44:42.248
grapples you to the
heart and love...

505
00:44:43.451 --> 00:44:44.415
of me.

506
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.468
- I am one. my liege.

507
00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:07.705
Whom the vile blows and
buffets of the world

508
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:09.143
have so incensed

509
00:45:10.211 --> 00:45:13.246
that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.

510
00:45:15.148 --> 00:45:17.019
- You know Banquo
was your enemy.

511
00:45:18.125 --> 00:45:19.021
So is he mine.

512
00:45:23.363 --> 00:45:25.723
- We are resolved. my lord.

513
00:45:29.734 --> 00:45:31.495
- Your spirits
shine through you.

514
00:45:34.274 --> 00:45:36.038
Must be done tonight.

515
00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:39.272
Fleance. his son.

516
00:45:40.445 --> 00:45:42.011
must embrace the fate

517
00:45:45.713 --> 00:45:47.445
of that dark hour.

518
00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:55.286
- Weary se'nnights.

519
00:45:55.322 --> 00:45:59.798
nine times nine shall he
dwindle. peak and pine!

520
00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:05.133
Though his bark
shall not be lost.

521
00:46:06.197 --> 00:46:09.500
yet it shall be tempest-tost.

522
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.814
Macbeth doth come.

523
00:46:30.758 --> 00:46:32.428
Macbeth doth come.

524
00:46:32.464 --> 00:46:33.524
- How now. my lord?

525
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.067
Why do you sit alone?

526
00:46:41.433 --> 00:46:45.008
Of sorriest fancies
your companions making.

527
00:46:46.339 --> 00:46:48.173
letting those thoughts
which should indeed

528
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:50.775
have died with
them they think on?

529
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:56.514
What's done is done.

530
00:47:03.155 --> 00:47:05.193
- Duncan is in his grave!

531
00:47:08.565 --> 00:47:10.465
He sleeps well!

00:47:12.365 --> 00:47:15.470

556
00:48:52.803 --> 00:48:55.369

557
00:48:58.009 --> 00:49:00.610
- There's
blood on your face.

558
00:49:00.645 --> 00:49:01.738
- 'Tis Banquo's then.

559
00:49:05.078 --> 00:49:06.446
- Is he dispatched?

560
00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:12.919
- His throat is cut.

561
00:49:12.954 --> 00:49:14.223
- That I did for him.

562
00:49:20.762 --> 00:49:21.626
- Fleance?

563
00:49:26.867 --> 00:49:28.105
- Fleance...

564
00:49:28.934 --> 00:49:30.374
escaped.

565
00:50:28.466 --> 00:50:29.397
Bleed.

566
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.598
Bleed. poor country.

567
00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:35.535
Great tyranny.

568
00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:40.973
I think our country
sinks beneath the yoke.

569
00:50:42.878 --> 00:50:44.241
- Sneakth on me?

570
00:50:44.276 --> 00:50:46.143
- Tis time. tis time.

571
00:50:47.415 --> 00:50:51.148
- Each new day. a gash

572
00:50:51.184 --> 00:50:53.124
opens up her wounds.

573
00:50:55.188 --> 00:50:57.420
A deed without a name.

574
00:50:57.455 --> 00:51:00.760
- Macbeth.

575
00:51:00.795 --> 00:51:01.660
Macbeth.

576
00:51:02.896 --> 00:51:04.098
Macbeth.

577
00:51:06.236 --> 00:51:09.039
- When I shall tread
upon the tyrant's head.

578
00:51:09.074 --> 00:51:10.874
or wear it on my sword.
yet my poor country.

579
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.004
- O Scotland.

580
00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:14.512
O Scotland.

581
00:51:37.403 --> 00:51:38.268
Macbeth.

582
00:51:39.438 --> 00:51:40.468
Macbeth.

583
00:51:43.237 --> 00:51:46.474
Be bloody. bold. and resolute.

584
00:51:48.407 --> 00:51:50.511
Laugh to scorn the power of man.

585
00:51:52.348 --> 00:51:55.648
for none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

586
00:52:04.195 --> 00:52:07.561
- Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing.

587
00:52:09.468 --> 00:52:10.563
Tell me.

588
00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:14.867
shall Banquo's issue ever
reign in this kingdom?

589
00:52:14.902 --> 00:52:15.767
Tell me!

590
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.609
- Seek to know no more.

591
00:52:24.376 --> 00:52:26.616
- I shall be satisfied!

592
00:53:33.379 --> 00:53:34.849
- Tomorrow

593
00:53:34.884 --> 00:53:35.913
and tomorrow

594
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.256
and tomorrow.

595
00:53:40.357 --> 00:53:43.987
Creeps in this petty
pace from day to day

596
00:53:46.594 --> 00:53:49.692
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

597
00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:54.331
- Sit. worthy friends.

598
00:53:55.033 --> 00:53:58.342
My lord is often thus and
hath been from his youth.

599
00:54:01.374 --> 00:54:02.874
The fit is momentary.

600
00:54:03.677 --> 00:54:05.979
Upon a thought. he
will again be well.

601
00:54:10.153 --> 00:54:12.389
Feed. and regard him not.

602
00:54:21.232 --> 00:54:23.398
- And
all our yesterdays

603
00:54:23.433 --> 00:54:28.669
have lighted fools the
way to dusty death.

604
00:54:28.937 --> 00:54:30.305
Out.

605
00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:34.373
out. brief candle.

606
00:54:34.408 --> 00:54:37.007
Life is but a walking shadow.

607
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:39.647
a poor player

608
00:54:40.847 --> 00:54:45.520
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

609
00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:50.287
and then is heard no more.

610
00:54:50.322 --> 00:54:51.626
It is a tale

611
00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:54.860
told by an idiot.

612
00:54:56.429 --> 00:54:58.501
full of sound and fury.

613
00:54:59.837 --> 00:55:00.701
signifying

614
00:55:02.608 --> 00:55:03.473
nothing.

615
00:55:06.238 --> 00:55:07.611
- See?

616
00:55:07.646 --> 00:55:08.577
There.

617
00:55:09.648 --> 00:55:10.678
Behold!

618
00:55:11.477 --> 00:55:12.781
- What. my good lord?

619
00:55:12.816 --> 00:55:13.681
- Look!

620
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:17.181
Look!

621
00:55:17.217 --> 00:55:18.686
I saw him!

622
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.625
I saw him!

623
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:23.420
I saw him!

624
00:55:30.662 --> 00:55:34.266
When the brains were out.

625
00:55:34.301 --> 00:55:35.632
the man would die.

626
00:55:35.667 --> 00:55:37.606
and there an end but now...

627
00:55:39.472 --> 00:55:41.742
oh. they rise again.

628
00:55:48.117 --> 00:55:49.651
- Noble friends.

629
00:55:53.487 --> 00:55:56.227
- I have a strange infirmity.

630
00:55:56.262 --> 00:56:00.697
which is nothing to
those that love me.

631
00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:01.729
Come.

632
00:56:03.169 --> 00:56:05.601
Love and health
to all. fill full.

633
00:56:06.233 --> 00:56:07.097
Fill full!

634
00:56:08.267 --> 00:56:09.466
Drink!

635
00:56:09.501 --> 00:56:11.134
Give me some wine!

636
00:56:16.244 --> 00:56:17.043
Give me some wine?

637
00:56:17.079 --> 00:56:17.882
Fill full.

638
00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:19.477
I drink to the general.

639
00:56:19.512 --> 00:56:23.053
Joy of the whole table.

640
00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:25.086
and to our dear friend. Banquo.

641
00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.086
Whom we miss.

642
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.458
Would he were here!

643
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.265
To all. and him. we
thirst. and all to all.

644
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.498
Let the earth hide thee!

645
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:46.068
Thy bones are marrowless!

646
00:56:46.103 --> 00:56:49.943
Thy blood is cold. thou
hast no speculation

647
00:56:50.712 --> 00:56:54.551
in those eyes which
thou dost glare with!

648
00:57:06.196 --> 00:57:08.226
What man dare. I dare...

649
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:11.998
Approach her like a
rugged Russian bear.

650
00:57:12.033 --> 00:57:16.667
the armed rhinoceros. or the
Hyrcan tiger. take any shape

651
00:57:16.702 --> 00:57:19.477
but that. and my firm nerves

652
00:57:20.346 --> 00:57:23.380
shall never tremble
or be alive again!

653
00:57:23.415 --> 00:57:26.880
And dare me to the
desert with your sword!

654
00:57:37.756 --> 00:57:40.861
- You have displaced the mirth.

655
00:57:42.595 --> 00:57:44.601
broke the good meeting.

656
00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:49.133
with most admired disorder.

657
00:57:52.606 --> 00:57:54.411
Think of this. good friends.

658
00:57:54.446 --> 00:57:57.273
as but a think of
custom. 'tis no other.

659
00:57:58.384 --> 00:58:01.178
Only it spoils the
pleasure of the time.

660
00:58:15.628 --> 00:58:17.700
- Can such things be.

661
00:58:18.833 --> 00:58:22.601
and overcome us like
a summer's cloud.

662
00:58:22.636 --> 00:58:24.773
without our special wonder?

663
00:58:26.078 --> 00:58:27.743
You make me strange

664
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.613
even to the
disposition that I owe.

665
00:58:31.648 --> 00:58:34.077
When now I think you
can behold such sights

666
00:58:34.112 --> 00:58:36.983
and keep the natural
ruby of your cheeks.

667
00:58:40.819 --> 00:58:43.891
When mine is blanched with fear.

668
00:58:49.564 --> 00:58:50.760
- Speak not.

669
00:58:50.796 --> 00:58:52.562
He grows worse and worse.

670
00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.907
At once.

671
00:58:56.942 --> 00:58:57.806
good night.

672
00:59:00.143 --> 00:59:01.473
Go. at once!

673
00:59:14.391 --> 00:59:16.324
- It will have blood. they say.

674
00:59:16.359 --> 00:59:17.621
Blood will have blood.

675
00:59:19.363 --> 00:59:22.094
Stones have been known to move

676
00:59:22.968 --> 00:59:23.832
and trees

677
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:26.703
to speak.

678
01:01:12.078 --> 01:01:13.408
- Help. help!

679
01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.450
Was my father a traitor?

680
01:01:22.485 --> 01:01:24.150
- Your father's dead.

681
01:01:28.327 --> 01:01:29.793
And what will you do now?

682
01:01:31.361 --> 01:01:33.126
How will you live?

683
01:01:36.928 --> 01:01:38.397
- What is a traitor?

684
01:01:38.432 --> 01:01:39.330
- Why?

685
01:01:40.306 --> 01:01:42.333
One that swears and lies.

686
01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:51.749
- And be all
traitors that do so?

687
01:01:53.315 --> 01:01:54.345
- Aye.

688
01:01:55.451 --> 01:01:56.347
- He is dead.

689
01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:05.928
- And must they all be
hanged who swear and lie?

690
01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:07.996
- All.

691
01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:12.795
Everyone.

692
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.304
- Everyone.

693
01:02:27.586 --> 01:02:29.380
- Who
must hang them?

694
01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:32.520
- Why. the honest men.

695
01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:02.446
- His flight was madness

696
01:03:02.482 --> 01:03:06.450
when our actions do not. our
fears do make us traitors.

697
01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:21.135
- Came they not by you?

698
01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:39.184
- To leave his wife.

699
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.957
to leave his babes. his
mansion and his titles

700
01:03:42.992 --> 01:03:45.522
in a place from whence
himself does fly?

701
01:03:48.432 --> 01:03:50.329
He loves us not.

702
01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:59.204
For the poor wren. the most
diminutive of birds will fight!

703
01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.440
Her young ones in her
nest. against the owl!

704
01:04:04.178 --> 01:04:08.010
All is the fear and
nothing is the love!

705
01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:09.117
- What's the boy.

706
01:04:10.749 --> 01:04:11.614
MacDuff?

707
01:04:13.459 --> 01:04:15.918
Was he not born of woman?

708
01:04:31.773 --> 01:04:33.636
Where is your husband?

709
01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:40.749
- I hope. in no
place so unsanctified

710
01:04:40.785 --> 01:04:43.514
where such as thou
mayst find him.

711
01:04:50.562 --> 01:04:52.460
God help thee. poor monkey!

712
01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:56.859
God help thee. poor monkey!

713
01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.465
Murder!

714
01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.730
Murder!

715
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:00.630
Murder!

716
01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:05.381
- Oh!

717
01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:06.547
Oh!

718
01:09:06.583 --> 01:09:07.448
Oh!

719
01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.788
- Bring me no more reports.

720
01:09:21.259 --> 01:09:22.661
I cannot taint

721
01:09:23.766 --> 01:09:24.795
with fear.

722
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.167
What's the boy. MacDuff.

723
01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:33.743
was he not born of woman?

724
01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:52.124
What's the boy. MacDuff.

725
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.462
was he not born of woman?

726
01:09:55.932 --> 01:09:57.300
- Look not so pale.

727
01:09:59.664 --> 01:10:01.497
I tell you yet again.
Banquo's buried.

728
01:10:01.532 --> 01:10:03.372
he cannot come out on his grave.

729
01:10:06.944 --> 01:10:09.840
- I cannot taint with fear.

730
01:10:19.857 --> 01:10:23.219
The spirits that know...

731
01:10:23.255 --> 01:10:25.856
all mortal...

732
01:10:26.862 --> 01:10:28.127
consequences

733
01:10:28.163 --> 01:10:29.860
have pronounced me thus...

734
01:10:31.162 --> 01:10:32.801
Ha!

735
01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.436
"Fear not. Macbeth.

736
01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:38.733
"No man that's born of woman

737
01:10:38.769 --> 01:10:41.872
"shall e'er have
power over thee."

738
01:10:46.148 --> 01:10:47.878
- The thane of Fife had a wife.

739
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.287
Where is she now?

740
01:10:53.987 --> 01:10:55.183
One.

741
01:10:55.219 --> 01:10:56.156
two.

742
01:10:56.191 --> 01:10:58.625
why then. 'tis time to do it.

743
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.965
To bed.

744
01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:07.370
To bed!

745
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.637
Come.

746
01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:13.543
Come.

747
01:11:13.578 --> 01:11:14.874
Come.

748
01:11:14.909 --> 01:11:15.774
Come.

749
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.274
Give me your hand.

750
01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:37.829
- What's done cannot be undone.

751
01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:43.399
Give me my armor!

752
01:11:44.809 --> 01:11:46.475
Give me my armor!

753
01:11:52.214 --> 01:11:54.412
- What's done cannot be undone.

754
01:11:54.447 --> 01:11:57.379
What's done cannot be undone.

755
01:12:58.717 --> 01:12:59.713
- Tomorrow

756
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.748
and tomorrow

757
01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:03.750
and tomorrow

758
01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:08.723
creeps in this petty
pace from day to day.

759
01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:13.494
Till the last syllable
of recorded time.

760
01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:16.493
and all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

761
01:13:16.528 --> 01:13:18.999
the way to dusty death.

762
01:14:12.584 --> 01:14:14.150
- How does my wife?

763
01:14:16.223 --> 01:14:17.120
- Why. well.

764
01:14:21.296 --> 01:14:23.159
- And all my children?

765
01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:26.563
- Well too.

766
01:14:29.066 --> 01:14:33.136
- The tyrant has not
battered at their peace?

767
01:14:34.744 --> 01:14:39.114
- No. they were well at
peace the last time I saw.

768
01:14:40.986 --> 01:14:42.312
- Help!

769
01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:43.212
Help!

770
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:46.985
Help!

771
01:14:48.993 --> 01:14:50.527
- If it be mine.

772
01:14:52.261 --> 01:14:53.860
keep it not from me.

773
01:14:57.563 --> 01:15:00.163
Quickly. let me have it.

774
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:04.836
My castle is surprised.

775
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:09.843
my wife and babes
savagely slaughtered.

776
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:14.650
What. my children too?

777
01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:24.559
Wife. children. servants. all!

778
01:15:24.594 --> 01:15:27.755
All that could be found.
my wife killed too!

779
01:15:29.661 --> 01:15:30.930
He has no children!

780
01:15:36.335 --> 01:15:37.737
All!

781
01:15:37.772 --> 01:15:40.107
Did you say. "All.
all. my pretty ones."

782
01:15:40.143 --> 01:15:41.908
Did you say all?

783
01:15:44.515 --> 01:15:48.882
- Dispute it like a man.

784
01:15:51.682 --> 01:15:52.919
Get thee back.

785
01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:54.921
My soul

786
01:15:55.989 --> 01:15:59.860
is too much charged with
blood of thine already.

787
01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:02.929
I bear

788
01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:05.602
a charmed life.

789
01:16:09.602 --> 01:16:11.036
which must not yield.

790
01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:15.678
to one of woman born.

791
01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:25.281
- MacDuff was from his
mother's womb untimely ripped.

792
01:18:27.638 --> 01:18:28.672
- Out!

793
01:18:28.707 --> 01:18:30.643
Out. brief candle!

794
01:18:30.678 --> 01:18:33.845
Life is but a walking shadow.

795
01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:37.352
a poor player that
struts and frets

796
01:18:37.387 --> 01:18:39.415
his hour upon the stage.

797
01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:42.451
And then

798
01:18:43.995 --> 01:18:44.860
is heard

799
01:18:46.624 --> 01:18:47.723
no more.

800
01:19:27.368 --> 01:19:28.266
It is

801
01:19:29.337 --> 01:19:30.268
a tale

802
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.105
told

803
01:19:33.474 --> 01:19:34.503
by an idiot.

804
01:19:37.413 --> 01:19:38.507
full of sound

805
01:19:41.383 --> 01:19:42.280
and fury.

806
01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:50.189
signifying...

807
01:19:52.063 --> 01:19:52.928
nothing.
