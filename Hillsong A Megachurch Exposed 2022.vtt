<i>and making them very branded</i>

166
00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:59.100
and understanding that church
can be done in a new way.
a modern way.

167
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.000

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:04.000
So Brian realized
this is how you do it.

170
00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:07.166
{\an8}<i>So it was all about the music</i>

171
00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:10.600
and taking the global aspects
that the world was going in

172
00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.166
and putting that into church
and making people

173
00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:14.567
feel a part
of something bigger

174
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.367
and understanding
it was about giving consumers
what they want.

175
00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.467
You know.
the customer is always right.

<i>While traveling</i>

177
00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:26.467
Brian Houston learned how
to get money out of people.

178
00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:27.667
so that they could build
the kingdom.

179
00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.000
<i>So one of the ideas</i>
<i>of the Pentecostal movement</i>

180
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
<i>So one of the ideas</i>
<i>of the Pentecostal movement</i>

181
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:34.667
is that there's
a special messenger

182
00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:39.567
{\an8}and this messenger
has been anointed by God
to bring the message.

183
00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:42.467
and some of that message
then is prosperity.

184
00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:45.967
As surely as I'm speaking
by the Spirit of God

185
00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:48.166
that is a word
for a person right now.

186
00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.100
that is God
penetrating your heart.

187
00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:52.066
It's burning
on the inside of you.

188
00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.967
And you need to make
a vow of faith
of a $1.000.

189
00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.867
"Oh. Bob.
couldn't you say $25.000?" No.

190
00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:00.000
Prosperity gospel

You should be

in terms of financial
prosperity.

194
00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.066

others over

I'm gonna have
some of that for me.

That was where
the real change happened.

And the church that I see
is a church of influence.

207
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.367
It's a church so large in size
that the city and nation
cannot ignore it.

208
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.567
[Tanya] <i>Brian Houston released</i>

It really got going

227
00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:45.900
That was when they really hit
on the music angle

and started spreading it
around Sydney and Australia.

[suspenseful music playing]

340
00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:31.600
Hillsong is an incredibly
successful organization.

341
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.000
{\an8}You know. they have massive
influence around the world.

342
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.700
And I can elaborate on that
if you want.

343
00:16:42.266 --> 00:16:47.667
I kind of categorized them
into six Cs.

344
00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:49.166
One. they're a Church.

355
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.567
You know. listen to my music
on a Sunday.

356
00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:25.867
Come to our church.

357
00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:26.151
You like the church.

on each other.

360
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:31.066
[Brian] <i>This is a conference.</i>

361
00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:32.667
<i>So conference</i>
<i>is a conference.</i>

362
00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:33.700
<i>but I've always</i>

363
00:17:33.767 --> 00:17:34.800
<i>It's a movement.</i>

364
00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:36.467
{\an8}So I went
to the Hillsong conference

365
00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:37.867
{\an8}in Sydney. Australia.

366
00:17:37.867 --> 00:17:41.166
{\an8}And. you know.
that ticket was 500 bucks.

367
00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:43.767
And then I bought
a bunch of stuff. you know?

368
00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:46.400
So I probably spent
$1.000 plus tithing.

369
00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:49.867
<i>Yeah. people have</i>
<i>just been so willing</i>
<i>to just keep on giving.</i>

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:02.767
It's a huge experience.
and it's a high
production value.

374
00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:05.000
and ticket sales
are really high

375
00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:06.100
and you can make
a lot of money there.

376
00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:09.000
[Craig] <i>It's a</i>
<i>money-making machine.</i>

377
00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:13.300
It has one purpose.
to get hold of as much

{\an8}In terms

382

{\an8}it's treating people

383
00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:35.667

<i>within your church.</i>

388
00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:52.500
Hillsong is much more
about selling you things.

389
00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:56.151
{\an8}They sell you CDs.
obviously. first and foremost.

394
00:19:05.266 --> 00:19:07.000

God as a way to profit?

402
00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:34.767
I don't have the answer.

403
00:19:34.767 --> 00:19:36.400

488
00:23:31.767 --> 00:23:33.800
It's very emotional.
I feel like.

489
00:23:33.867 --> 00:23:36.000
for a lot of people.
and that really like...

490
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:38.266
Even if you're just kind of
there and unsure of things...

491
00:23:38.266 --> 00:23:39.800
Which I was young.

492
00:23:39.867 --> 00:23:42.367
I was looking for. you know.
community and stuff like that.

493
00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:46.400
It can be really like
addicting in the best sense
of the word.

494
00:23:48.867 --> 00:23:52.700
[Brando] <i>Hillsong at the time</i>
<i>that they were starting</i>
<i>the New York plant.</i>

495
00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:56.151
{\an8}I knew Hillsong itself
was like anti-homosexual.

496
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:57.000
{\an8}I knew Hillsong itself
was like anti-homosexual.

497
00:23:57.667 --> 00:24:00.266
the no sex before marriage.
all those things.

498
00:24:00.266 --> 00:24:02.300
I knew that they were
that still.

499
00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:04.700
<i>but it was always</i>
<i>about purpose.</i>

500
00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:07.467
It was always about
trying to fulfill your dreams

501
00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:10.667
<i>and getting people</i>
<i>of my age group.</i>

502
00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:13.667
<i>which was early 20s.</i>
<i>early mid-20s.</i>

503
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:16.200
<i>to serve one another.</i>
<i>serve your community.</i>

504
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.000
That right there was exactly
what I needed

505
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.667
for social interaction
was to be at a church.

506
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:25.266
a megachurch.
that's full of people

507
00:24:25.266 --> 00:24:26.151
and getting connected
that way.

508
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:26.467
and getting connected
that way.

509
00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:30.867
Another thing that Hillsong
has done really well

510
00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:32.967
is what
I call nightclub rules.

511
00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:34.367
They're very good
at understanding

512
00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:36.166
that to get young men
into a church.

513
00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.467
it's very handy to have
a lot of young women.

514
00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:42.567
They're very good in saying.
"Hey. this is church
done our way.

515
00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:46.266
This is different to what your
grandmother's church is.

516
00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:47.700
<i>You know.</i>
<i>if you don't like it.</i>
<i>that's cool.</i>

517
00:24:47.767 --> 00:24:49.667
<i>but just come along</i>
<i>and enjoy yourself."</i>

518
00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:51.667
<i>And that really worked out.</i>

519
00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:56.151
[Ben] <i>It goes back</i>
<i>to demographics.</i>
<i>It goes back to marketing.</i>

520
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:57.000
[Ben] <i>It goes back</i>
<i>to demographics.</i>
<i>It goes back to marketing.</i>

521
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:02.700
<i>It goes back</i>
<i>to a well-thought-out</i>
<i>business plan.</i>

522
00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:12.367
The people
that the system benefits
really. really get rewarded.

523
00:25:12.367 --> 00:25:16.467
You know.
if you're a charismatic
and outgoing person who's...

524
00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:18.500
You know. who can really bring
the crowds in

525
00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:20.066
and get the money
out of people.

526
00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:22.467
You're gonna be
very successful in Hillsong.

527
00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:25.700
and that's what happened
in the case with Carl Lentz.

528
00:25:25.767 --> 00:25:26.151
{\an8}We're pretty confident
you've never met a pastor
like Carl Lentz.

529
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:27.000
{\an8}We're pretty confident
you've never met a pastor

[cheers and applause]

535
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.000
{\an8}My name is Carl Lentz.

536
00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:44.200
{\an8}I pastor Hillsong
New York City.

537
00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:49.166
<i>I'm from Virginia.</i>
<i>Not everybody</i>
<i>affiliated with us.</i>

538
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:51.100
<i>you know.</i>
<i>Hillsong. is Australian.</i>

539
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.767
[Elle] <i>Carl Lentz</i>
<i>came out from America</i>

540
00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:58.867
and trained
at Hillsong College
when he was younger.

541
00:25:58.867 --> 00:26:03.567
{\an8}Brian Houston had his sights
on global expansion
for 30 years now.

542
00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:05.667
And I think
when he saw Carl Lentz.

543
00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:07.367
he realized
he'd hit the jackpot.

544
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.138
{\an8}Carl does have this X factor.

545
00:26:10.138 --> 00:26:11.000
{\an8}Carl does have this X factor.

546
00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:13.867
I have gum
'cause I break rules.

547
00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:15.767
I'm not supposed to have gum
but I do it anyway.

548
00:26:15.767 --> 00:26:19.367
[Ben] <i>He's in shape.</i>
<i>He's attractive.</i>

549
00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:21.867
{\an8}I was showing my friend
a photo of Carl

550
00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:23.367
{\an8}when I first started
reporting on Hillsong

551
00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:25.467
{\an8}and she thought he was
from the <i>Jersey Shore.</i>

552
00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:28.467
I mean. he's clearly a man
who cares a lot about his body

553
00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:31.567
<i>and his presentation</i>
<i>and his appearance.</i>

554
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.767
He dresses well.

555
00:26:34.767 --> 00:26:39.000
He was always about
the tattoos.
the trendy stubble. jeans.

556
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.138
<i>leather jacket.</i>
<i>that sort of thing.</i>

557
00:26:40.138 --> 00:26:40.667
<i>leather jacket.</i>
<i>that sort of thing.</i>

558
00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:41.000
{\an8}and it shows a different way
of doing things

559
00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:47.400
{\an8}and it makes you feel that
your belief system is valid
in the modern world.

560
00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.266
But this is the way
you dress normally and--

561
00:26:49.266 --> 00:26:50.767
No. I normally have
a collar and robe.

562
00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:52.266
-You do? Uh-huh.
-No. I'm kidding.

563
00:26:52.266 --> 00:26:53.867
-This is it.
-[laughter]

564
00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:58.066
{\an8}He smiled a lot.
It was very. you know. smooth.

565
00:26:58.066 --> 00:27:00.767
[Craig] <i>He was the face.</i>
<i>very good-looking guy.</i>

566
00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:03.266
You know. he was
a very. very charming guy.

567
00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:05.567
<i>Had beautiful wife.</i>
<i>beautiful children.</i>

568
00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:07.166
<i>It was just like.</i>
<i>wow. this...</i>

569
00:27:07.166 --> 00:27:09.700
You know. this guy is...
He's really something.

570
00:27:09.767 --> 00:27:10.138
No. I'm not the same.
I don't think the same.

571
00:27:10.138 --> 00:27:11.000
No. I'm not the same.
I don't think the same.

572
00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:12.767
I don't talk the same.
And I don't know

573
00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:15.166
if greatness is in my future.
but I do know

574
00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.100
that I feel God's hand
on my life

575
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:19.667
and I'm trying to find ways
to tell people about it.

576
00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:24.567
Carl is a very. very
charismatic person on stage.

577
00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.467
I mean. did you all
watch the royal wedding.

578
00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:28.000
a couple of months back?
Anybody?

579
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.200
I didn't either because we.

580
00:27:29.266 --> 00:27:31.166
in America. you know.
we have one king.

581
00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.767
His name is Jesus.
Carl. get over it.

582
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.166
{\an8}Sometimes it's like you're
acting a fool a little bit.
but it's totally fine.

583
00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.667
{\an8}Like it makes you feel
more comfortable

584
00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:40.100
when someone
is being goofy on stage

585
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.000
or cool or suave
or whatever it is.

586
00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:44.467
He had a way
of like connecting

587
00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:47.000
and making people
in the audience feel at ease.

588
00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:53.800
He brought a very fresh.
charismatic. fiery energy.

589
00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:56.800
I can actually embrace
the teachings of Jesus.

590
00:27:56.867 --> 00:28:00.767
I can embrace his grace.
Where are you sitting at?

591
00:28:00.767 --> 00:28:03.567
Are you hand shaking yourself
in your sleeping roll?

592
00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:07.200
Carl clearly changed the way

593
00:28:07.266 --> 00:28:09.767
that many of us saw
how church could be done.

594
00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:10.138
{\an8}[female reporter]
<i>And some New Yorkers</i>

595

{\an8}[female reporter]
<i>And some New Yorkers</i>
<i>can't seem to get enough</i>

596
00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:15.266
{\an8}<i>of their unlikely pastor.</i>

597
00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:20.166
Carl Lentz. I mean.
he's drawing people in
to Hillsong New York.

598
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.000
<i>You should see that line</i>
<i>on a Sunday morning.</i>

<i>Subscribe if you haven't yet.</i>

600
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.567
But let's face it.

601
00:28:28.567 --> 00:28:30.667
they're not coming there
for sound doctrine.

602
00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:32.567
They're not coming there
to be fed the Word.

603
00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:34.700
They're coming there
to see the cool Carl Lentz.

604
00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:37.667
Ain't it amazing
what God has done?

605
00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.138
And I have a feeling
that the best is yet to come.

606
00:28:40.138 --> 00:28:41.000
And I have a feeling
that the best is yet to come.

607
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.000
[woman] <i>I don't like to say</i>
<i>like celebrity pastors.</i>

608
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.100
but I do feel like there is
that kind of celebrity pastor

609
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.800
environment that
we're living in right now.

610
00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:52.367
But I found out about Carl

611
00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:55.600
and knew that I wanted
to attend this church
when I came to go to NYU.

612
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:58.700
That guy was iconic.
It was the glasses.

613
00:28:58.767 --> 00:29:00.900
[laughs] Like he just
was like really...

614
00:29:00.967 --> 00:29:02.767
He was really confident.
but you can tell that

615
00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:04.567
it was coming from like
a super authentic place.

616
00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:07.900
Like he was someone
that was genuine and he...

617
00:29:07.967 --> 00:29:10.138
He'd been through [bleep]
but he had confidence
and he could get you engaged.

618
00:29:10.138 --> 00:29:11.000
He'd been through [bleep]
but he had confidence
and he could get you engaged.

619
00:29:12.767 --> 00:29:15.500
I mean. personally. yeah.
it was cool
when other pastors came.

620
00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:17.667
but when it was Carl.
I was like...

621
00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:21.767
"I'm glad I came
to the 7:00 p.m.." you know?

622
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.200
A few years ago.
I started an Instagram account

623
00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:34.166
showing megachurch pastors
wearing expensive sneakers.

624
00:29:35.767 --> 00:29:38.567
<i>I noticed that there were</i>
<i>a whole slew of pastors</i>

625
00:29:38.567 --> 00:29:40.138
<i>and worship leaders</i>
<i>that were wearing</i>

626
00:29:40.138 --> 00:29:40.166

627

<i>the most expensive</i>
<i>streetwear out there.</i>

628
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.800
Supreme. Off-White.
Jordan Collabs.

629
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:49.066
Gucci. Louis Vuitton.
all these incredibly
expensive brands.

630
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:53.266
<i>And I called it</i>
<i>preachersnsneakers.</i>

631
00:29:53.266 --> 00:29:55.767
<i>It was not meant</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

632

{\an8}<i>other than just to</i>
<i>make your friends laugh</i>
<i>for a second and move on.</i>

633
00:29:59.367 --> 00:30:03.000
And then in four weeks.
I had 100.000 followers.

634
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.967
<i>So I'm just</i>
<i>in the middle of this.</i>
<i>watching this account grow.</i>

635

what I stepped into.
but knowing that there was

636
00:30:09.066 --> 00:30:10.138
something important happening
because people
were freaking out.

637
00:30:10.138 --> 00:30:11.000

651

from his Instagram

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:55.600

Nike Air Fear of God sneakers.

654
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.266

another picture of him

655
00:31:03.266 --> 00:31:06.867
wearing a Supreme
x Louis Vuitton hoodie.

656
00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:08.967
{\an8}And what do you do in this
conference. hanging out?

657
00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.138
{\an8}Yeah. we've been hanging.

658

-Just living the dream.

-We have been.

662

That hoodie. at the time.

663
00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:21.467
I think was
on the resale market

664
00:31:21.467 --> 00:31:23.567
for like $10.000 or $15.000.

665
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.100

666

667

<i>like 10.000 members.</i>

668
00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:35.467
they're transparent
about their money.

669
00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:39.000
And I think that should be
the minimum expectation

670
00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.138
of a church that's bringing in
$100 million a year.

671

675
00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:54.500
Maybe this is the best way
to do church.

676
00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:57.467
Like maybe this
is the best way
to treat our pastors.

677
00:31:57.467 --> 00:32:00.100
by showering them with gifts
and private jets

678
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.266
and courtside seats
and all that kind of stuff.

679
00:32:03.266 --> 00:32:09.667

questioned if it actually is
the best way?

<i>Carl reached out to me</i>

Every news agency
is calling me.
trying to figure out who I am.

701
00:33:15.266 --> 00:33:16.667

is saying like.

702
00:33:16.667 --> 00:33:18.266
"Hey. you know. we're
the newspaper of records.

703
00:33:18.266 --> 00:33:20.100

your identity."

704
00:33:20.166 --> 00:33:21.567
and I passed.

705
00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:23.767
The <i>Today</i> show asked me
to come on and I passed.

706
00:33:23.767 --> 00:33:29.000
But I'll never forget this
when Carl and I
got on the phone.

707
00:33:29.066 --> 00:33:32.000
the first thing
that he said to me was like.

708
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.467
"So who am I talking with.
man?"

709
00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:35.066
I mean.
let's level with each other."

710
00:33:35.066 --> 00:33:37.166
I just said. "My name is Ben."

711
00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:39.467
And so he got my name.

712
00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:40.138
I somehow trusted him

713
00:33:40.138 --> 00:33:41.000
I somehow trusted him

714
00:33:43.767 --> 00:33:47.266
from the first moment we spoke
and I think that's...

715
00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:50.667
I guess.
that's just like a testament
to how good he is with people.

716
00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:54.567
<i>So we had a real conversation</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

717
00:33:54.567 --> 00:33:56.100
He texted me a few times.

718
00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:58.900
He kind of like
went back and forth

719
00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:01.900
between like. "Hey. I disagree
with what you're doing.

720
00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:06.400
Basically.
like it's an unfair spotlight
to put on people."

721
00:34:06.467 --> 00:34:09.867
and I thought that was fair.

722
00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:10.138
but at the same time.
he leveled with me.

723
00:34:10.138 --> 00:34:11.000
but at the same time.
he leveled with me.

724
00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:14.400
He was like. "Hey. I get it.

Now. it's like anything.

728
00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:25.266

it makes it a little harder

as you were before online.

730
00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:31.600

731
00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:33.000

738

I was like. "Oh. okay.

"Oh. I might see
Justin Bieber."

I did know that Justin Bieber
goes to a Hillsong Church.
It's exciting.

where you can be religious

849
00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:48.266

the Church of the Stars

{\an8}The goal of our church

Was it a lucky coincidence
that Bieber got involved
with Hillsong?

863
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:25.867
I'm gonna have to be
a bit of a cynic.

864
00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:28.500
given that I feel very sure

865
00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:29.727
that it was part
of the Hillsong strategy
to attract celebrities

that it was part

<i>was wearing thin.</i>

874
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:54.667
He needed to look like he'd
had this great time of faith

<i>and. well.</i>
<i>he's turning over a new leaf.</i>

876
00:40:58.166 --> 00:40:59.727
So they really worked out
well for each other
at exactly the right moment.

877

So they really worked out
well for each other

878
00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:04.967
Is it possible
they just ran into each other

on the same day?
Yes. I'm not...

880
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.567
I think it's far more likely
that Carl Lentz

881
00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:13.467
saw an opportunity
in Justin Bieber and took it.

duplicitous or hypocritical.

To me. that is inherently
duplicitous or hypocritical.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.467
So on a day when Pastor Carl
will come down from New York

966
00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:29.727
and preach at the service.
come in using a limo.

967
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:30.000
and preach at the service.
come in using a limo.

968
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:35.266
<i>Excitement everywhere.</i>
<i>Much like the president's</i>
<i>coming to town.</i>

969
00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:39.367
-[woman] Hi.
Welcome to the palace.
-[Carl] Good to be here.

970
00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:43.600
All the volunteers
were on high alert.
High alert.

971
00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:45.867
<i>Typically. his advance man</i>
<i>security would come.</i>

972
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:47.367
<i>We'd walk around the venue.</i>

973
00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:49.100
<i>give them</i>
<i>the lay of the land.</i>

974
00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:52.767
Once he hit that stage.
pure rock star.

975
00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:57.667
I pray that in your life
you are not missing
a move of God.

976
00:45:57.667 --> 00:45:59.727
He will bless your life.
he will magnify your voice.

977
00:45:59.727 --> 00:46:00.000
He will bless your life.
he will magnify your voice.

978
00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:03.500
and He will give you ground
you have not asked.

979
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.867
The second he was off.
he's right into the car
and off to the next venue.

980
00:46:12.266 --> 00:46:14.066
<i>You know. as security.</i>
<i>you don't draw judgments.</i>

981
00:46:14.066 --> 00:46:17.166
<i>I'm there to protect</i>
<i>the venue and everybody.</i>

982
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:22.100
But I am not familiar
with that type of relationship

983
00:46:22.166 --> 00:46:24.100
between a preacher
and the congregation.

984
00:46:24.166 --> 00:46:25.767
Any church
I've been involved with.

985
00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:29.200
I can walk in
my pastor's office.

986
00:46:29.266 --> 00:46:29.727
Their door is certainly open.
especially after a sermon.

987
00:46:29.727 --> 00:46:30.000
Their door is certainly open.
especially after a sermon.

988
00:46:32.066 --> 00:46:35.500
and that just didn't happen
when Pastor Carl was there.

989
00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:41.967
[woman] <i>Is Carl the next</i>
<i>Brian Houston.</i>
<i>the next Joel Osteen?</i>

990
00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:44.467
{\an8}Could well be.
Carl. obviously. you know.

991
00:46:44.467 --> 00:46:46.166
{\an8}he's a magnetic.
attractive guy.

992
00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:47.567
{\an8}I mean. his tattoos
are a problem but--

993
00:46:47.567 --> 00:46:48.967
{\an8}You don't like the tattoos?

994
00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:51.166
{\an8}Uh. they're okay.
They're okay.

995
00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:52.667
{\an8}Yeah. Great.

996
00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:54.800
{\an8}Thanks. Bobby.
for bringing that up.

997
00:46:54.867 --> 00:46:57.166
It was like...
There was a separation.

998
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:59.727
It was like you didn't think
of Hillsong Church
and Brian Houston anymore.

999
00:46:59.727 --> 00:47:00.000
It was like you didn't think
of Hillsong Church
and Brian Houston anymore.

1000
00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:04.266
You thought of Hillsong Church
and Carl Lentz.

1001
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.200
<i>The Hillsong Band</i>
<i>is what got him here.</i>

1002
00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:09.700
<i>But then Carl became bigger</i>
<i>than what Hillsong was.</i>

1003
00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:12.166
[beeping]

1004
00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:14.467
<i>Carl made himself</i>
<i>untouchable.</i>

1005
00:47:14.467 --> 00:47:16.500
There have been
pastors that have...

1006
00:47:17.967 --> 00:47:20.967
{\an8}begun to outshine the boss.

1007
00:47:20.967 --> 00:47:24.700
{\an8}And I think
that's what happened
in the case with Carl Lentz.

1008
00:47:26.367 --> 00:47:29.727
It was always like.
"Be careful. man."

1009
00:47:29.727 --> 00:47:30.000
It was always like.
"Be careful. man."

1010
00:47:30.066 --> 00:47:32.767
Because the only thing
everyone likes more than

1011
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:35.900
a rising star
is a falling star. right?

1012
00:47:37.567 --> 00:47:39.467
Eventually. the stardom's
gonna catch up with you.

1013
00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:46.467
[Craig] <i>Carl Lentz.</i>
<i>I mean. think about it.</i>

1014
00:47:46.467 --> 00:47:50.400
He's one of the top
revenue streams
in the organization.

1015
00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:52.200
If you got any reason
to be grateful.

1016
00:47:52.266 --> 00:47:53.767
why don't you give Jesus
a shout of praise.

1017
00:47:53.767 --> 00:47:56.200
you just stir it up
a little bit tonight.

1018
00:47:56.266 --> 00:48:00.800
{\an8}His franchise location
is pulling down
probably more than

1019
00:48:00.867 --> 00:48:03.967
{\an8}any other franchise location
in the world.

1020
00:48:05.066 --> 00:48:07.166
<i>Carl Lentz is the superstar.</i>

1021
00:48:09.967 --> 00:48:11.867
<i>This is the kingdom</i>

1022
00:48:11.867 --> 00:48:13.794
that Carl Lentz
wants to be a part of.

1023
00:48:13.794 --> 00:48:14.000
that Carl Lentz
wants to be a part of.

1024
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.767
{\an8}Wherever Jesus went.
there were absolute
throngs of people

1025
00:48:18.767 --> 00:48:20.033
{\an8}trying to get to him.

1026
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
He craved that
sort of notoriety.
that sort of celebrity.

1027
00:48:27.066 --> 00:48:32.300
Every university felt it.
Every club felt it.
Every prison felt it.

1028
00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:34.200
Every place of people
will love it.

1029
00:48:36.467 --> 00:48:39.100
{\an8}I think that narcissism
and control

1030
00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:43.567
{\an8}does not have a place
in a pastor position.

1031
00:48:43.567 --> 00:48:43.794
He should probably
be a comedian.

1032
00:48:43.794 --> 00:48:44.000
He should probably
be a comedian.

1033
00:48:45.066 --> 00:48:46.700
maybe even a public speaker.

1034
00:48:46.767 --> 00:48:49.200
<i>But the pastor</i>
<i>is supposed to serve.</i>

1035
00:48:49.266 --> 00:48:51.667
<i>A pastor</i>
<i>is supposed to protect.</i>

1036
00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:53.066
A pastor is supposed to love.

1037
00:48:53.066 --> 00:48:56.200
A pastor is not
seeking his own attention

1038
00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:59.500
and his own titles and...

1039
00:49:00.567 --> 00:49:01.767
You name it.

1040
00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:08.266
Judging from
the godlike behavior

1041
00:49:08.266 --> 00:49:09.500
that I witnessed.

1042
00:49:09.567 --> 00:49:11.967
100% percent. I do.

1043
00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:13.794
Carl is definitely
a narcissist.

1044
00:49:13.794 --> 00:49:14.000
Carl is definitely
a narcissist.

1045
00:49:15.567 --> 00:49:17.200
{\an8}I think you have to be
a narcissist

1046
00:49:17.266 --> 00:49:20.100
{\an8}to succeed
with any megachurch.

1047
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.500
{\an8}The Lord is my shepherd
and I lack nothing.

1048
00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:28.066
He is so full of himself
with arrogance.

1049
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:30.166
<i>And that's a big problem.</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1050
00:49:30.166 --> 00:49:31.567
because he's the founder

1051
00:49:31.567 --> 00:49:33.967
of this very dangerous.
charismatic movement

1052
00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:36.266
<i>that young people</i>
<i>are really attracted to.</i>

1053
00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:38.066
The worst culture gets.

1054
00:49:38.066 --> 00:49:39.900
the better it is for us.

1055
00:49:39.967 --> 00:49:41.400
because people are...

1056
00:49:41.467 --> 00:49:43.794
They're not buying
what culture is selling

1057
00:49:43.794 --> 00:49:44.000
They're not buying
what culture is selling

1058
00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:46.266
like they used to.

1059
00:49:46.266 --> 00:49:47.867
People are looking
for real answers.

1060
00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:51.767
[Brando]
<i>They bring you in with culture</i>

1061
00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:54.166
{\an8}and so getting it in
with music

1062
00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:56.367
{\an8}and our age group.
our clothes.

1063
00:49:56.367 --> 00:49:58.367
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>everyone started dressing</i>

1064
00:49:58.367 --> 00:50:00.400
<i>the exact same way</i>
<i>as Carl Lentz.</i>

1065
00:50:05.867 --> 00:50:06.867
It is a very great word.

1066
00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:08.367
Idolizing is the perfect word

1067
00:50:08.367 --> 00:50:10.667
<i>because Carl Lentz</i>
<i>became a cult leader</i>

1068
00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:12.000
<i>to a bunch of people like me</i>

1069
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.500
<i>that ended up</i>
<i>trying to follow</i>

1070
00:50:13.567 --> 00:50:13.794

1071
00:50:13.794 --> 00:50:14.000
<i>into this thing of.</i>

1072
00:50:14.967 --> 00:50:17.000
<i>"I want to be big</i>
<i>and powerful and cool</i>

1073
00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:19.367
and have people wanna be
on fire for something

1074
00:50:19.367 --> 00:50:20.800
and lead people."

1075
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.066
Yes. Oh. yeah.

1076
00:50:31.066 --> 00:50:32.967
{\an8}A cult is when I tell you
what to think

1077
00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:34.300
{\an8}and if you think
any different.

1078
00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:35.300
{\an8}-you're gone.
-Hmm.

1079
00:50:35.367 --> 00:50:36.367
{\an8}That's a cult.

1080
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.500
{\an8}We preach the opposite.

1081
00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:41.200
Actually. you should go home
and question what I preach.

1082
00:50:41.266 --> 00:50:42.767
You should look it up
in your own <i>Bible.</i>

1083
00:50:45.166 --> 00:50:51.100
{\an8}Is creating a brand
or an idol out of a pastor

1084
00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:52.567
{\an8}or preacher problematic?

1085
00:50:52.567 --> 00:50:53.767
I think so.

1086
00:50:57.667 --> 00:51:00.367
And if the church's
whole thing

1087
00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:03.100
is based on
that one guy or girl.

1088
00:51:03.166 --> 00:51:06.200
one really impressive.

1089
00:51:06.266 --> 00:51:10.967
attractive. entertaining.
talented person

1090
00:51:11.567 --> 00:51:13.100
that is doing great

1091
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:13.794
but is one misstep away

1092
00:51:13.794 --> 00:51:14.000
but is one misstep away

1093
00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:17.100
from literally imploding
the entire thing.

1094
00:51:17.166 --> 00:51:19.166
your ministry is now eroded.

1095
00:51:19.166 --> 00:51:22.266
It's built on sand
in a lot of ways.

1096
00:51:26.767 --> 00:51:29.000
Hillsong
has tremendous leaders

1097
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.400
in so many different churches.

1098
00:51:30.467 --> 00:51:34.100
{\an8}Of course that's led
to a lot of celebrity.

1099
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.367
But at the core of it.
at the heart of it.

1100
00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:39.867
is a church that I believe

1101
00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:42.300
is genuinely a work of God.

1102
00:51:42.367 --> 00:51:43.794
It helps people
to believe that

1103
00:51:43.794 --> 00:51:44.000
It helps people
to believe that

1104
00:51:44.266 --> 00:51:46.600
there is a God who loves them
and cares for them

1105
00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:49.000
and has a plan
for their lives.

1106
00:51:50.767 --> 00:51:52.767

1129
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:09.767
That's where I went
to high school.

1130
00:53:09.767 --> 00:53:11.000
a few years apart.

1131
00:53:15.467 --> 00:53:16.700
-Speaking of the devil--
-[Sammy] Yeah.

1132
00:53:16.767 --> 00:53:17.631
[Jaclyn] I mean.
right now. Wave Church.

1133
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:18.000
[Jaclyn] I mean.
right now. Wave Church.

1134
00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:22.700
[Sammy] Yes.

1135
00:53:22.767 --> 00:53:24.367
Where it all began.

1136
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.567
<i>I'm Jaclyn.</i>

1137
00:53:26.567 --> 00:53:30.800
{\an8}and I went to Wave Church
for 17 years.

1138
00:53:30.867 --> 00:53:34.467
{\an8}so from the time
I was 17 till 34.

1139
00:53:34.467 --> 00:53:36.467
I'm Sammy.

1140
00:53:36.467 --> 00:53:41.200
I attended Wave Church
for about eight years

1141
00:53:41.266 --> 00:53:44.800
and interned under Carl Lentz.

1142
00:53:44.867 --> 00:53:47.631
who was the pastor
of the Young Adults Ministry

1143
00:53:47.631 --> 00:53:47.700
who was the pastor
of the Young Adults Ministry

1144
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:48.000
<i>before Hillsong.</i>

1145
00:53:51.867 --> 00:53:53.867
[Jaclyn] My kids still wave
to the church when we go by.

1146
00:53:53.867 --> 00:53:55.367
-[Sammy] Really?
-[Jaclyn] Yeah.

1147
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.367
How are they about that?

1148
00:53:58.367 --> 00:54:01.166
They didn't understand. like.

1149
00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:04.166
why we left their friends.
you know?

1150
00:54:04.166 --> 00:54:06.100
And that was
the hardest part for us too.

1151
00:54:06.166 --> 00:54:07.700
was just leaving behind
friendships.

1152
00:54:07.767 --> 00:54:09.467
I basically just
had to explain like.

1153
00:54:09.467 --> 00:54:13.100
"Well. you know.
Mommy didn't understand

1154
00:54:13.166 --> 00:54:14.467
that the way I was being led

1155
00:54:14.467 --> 00:54:16.100
was not the way
God wanted us to be led."

1156
00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.767
<i>Wave Church is a</i>
<i>non-denominational church</i>

1157
00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:28.066
<i>in Virginia Beach.</i>

1158
00:54:28.066 --> 00:54:31.000
Anything that's not faith
is sin.

1159
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.033
And with that--

1160
00:54:32.066 --> 00:54:35.467
Steve Kelly is the senior
pastor at Wave Church.

1161
00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:37.567
So the Bible said. if you're
gonna come to the God.

1162
00:54:37.567 --> 00:54:39.500
you're gonna come believing
that He is.

1163
00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:43.467
Steve Kelly
is an Australian citizen.

1164
00:54:43.467 --> 00:54:47.266
<i>works at Hillsong Church</i>
<i>for about a decade</i>

1165
00:54:47.266 --> 00:54:47.631
and then moved
to Virginia Beach

1166
00:54:47.631 --> 00:54:48.000
and then moved
to Virginia Beach

1167
00:54:48.867 --> 00:54:50.467
to pastor this church.

1168
00:54:50.467 --> 00:54:53.200
<i>That was in 2001.</i>

1169
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.567
I loved the people there.

1170
00:55:02.567 --> 00:55:04.967
I thought that
it was very deep.

1171
00:55:04.967 --> 00:55:06.367
You know. I thought it was...

1172
00:55:06.367 --> 00:55:07.567
<i>it was not super surface-y.</i>

1173
00:55:07.567 --> 00:55:10.867
<i>And I left every week</i>
<i>feeling.</i>

1174
00:55:10.867 --> 00:55:12.867
like. hopeful.

1175
00:55:12.867 --> 00:55:16.266
You can have hope
without faith.

1176
00:55:16.266 --> 00:55:17.631
but you cannot have faith
without hope.

1177
00:55:17.631 --> 00:55:18.000
but you cannot have faith
without hope.

1178
00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:22.367
Eventually.
this couple was introduced

1179
00:55:22.367 --> 00:55:25.667
and it was Carl Lentz
and his beautiful wife Laura.

1180
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.100
{\an8}We went to the same
high school.

1181
00:55:30.166 --> 00:55:31.667
He was three years older
than me

1182
00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:32.967
and he knew my older sister.

1183
00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:36.867
<i>So I only knew a little bit</i>
<i>about him from my friends.</i>

1184
00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:41.166
<i>But he did have a reputation.</i>

1185
00:55:41.166 --> 00:55:43.500
<i>When I first met him at Wave.</i>

1186
00:55:43.567 --> 00:55:46.166
he was like. "You have
a sister. an older sister?"

1187
00:55:46.166 --> 00:55:47.367
And I was like. "Yeah."

1188
00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:47.631
And he was like.
"Is she really pretty?"

1189
00:55:47.631 --> 00:55:48.000
And he was like.
"Is she really pretty?"

1190
00:55:49.266 --> 00:55:50.767
And I was like.
"Yeah. she's pretty."

1191
00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:54.500
<i>And he was like. "Yeah.</i>
<i>I think I remember her."</i>

1192
00:55:54.567 --> 00:55:57.000
That kind of rubbed me
strangely.

1193
00:55:57.066 --> 00:55:59.967
Like that's how you...
that's how you know me now.

1194
00:55:59.967 --> 00:56:02.467
You know. I had only heard
about his history.

1195
00:56:02.467 --> 00:56:06.100
but he was a spectacular
basketball player

1196
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.166
<i>from what I hear.</i>

1197
00:56:07.166 --> 00:56:10.500
<i>And he went to Cox</i>
<i>and NC State after that.</i>

1198
00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:12.867
And his own words were.
he was a player.

1199
00:56:12.867 --> 00:56:14.066
He used to tell us that

1200
00:56:14.066 --> 00:56:15.767
he was a little open
with his past

1201
00:56:15.767 --> 00:56:17.367
and. you know.
he let us know that

1202
00:56:17.367 --> 00:56:17.631
he had a life before Laura.

1203
00:56:17.631 --> 00:56:18.000
he had a life before Laura.

1204
00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:24.600
But he did end up at Hillsong
Bible College in Australia

1205
00:56:24.667 --> 00:56:26.867
<i>and that's where</i>
<i>he met Laura.</i>

1206
00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:28.400
When you go
to Hillsong College.

1207
00:56:28.467 --> 00:56:29.967
it's because you probably
wanna be a pastor.

1208
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:40.800
He was definitely valuable.

1209
00:56:40.867 --> 00:56:44.567
<i>More young adults started</i>
<i>to be attracted</i>

1210
00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:47.631
to his presence at the church.

1211
00:56:47.631 --> 00:56:48.000
to his presence at the church.

1212
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.000
<i>When they came. it was like</i>
<i>a shiny new penny.</i>

1213
00:56:57.066 --> 00:56:58.200
You know.
they were both attractive.

1214
00:56:58.266 --> 00:57:00.066
Their relationship
was attractive.

1215
00:57:00.066 --> 00:57:02.767
and they became
our young adults pastors.

1216
00:57:02.767 --> 00:57:04.567
[crowd cheering]

1217
00:57:04.567 --> 00:57:05.867
<i>How are you doing?</i>
<i>Don't sit down.</i>

1218
00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:07.567
<i>You're crazy.</i>
<i>We just started.</i>

1219
00:57:08.567 --> 00:57:10.166
Everything changed after that.

1220
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.467
When Carl came.
it was definitely

1221
00:57:14.467 --> 00:57:17.631
a different atmosphere.
culture. community.

1222
00:57:17.631 --> 00:57:17.667
a different atmosphere.
culture. community.

1223
00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:18.000
The pastoral role definitely

1224
00:57:20.066 --> 00:57:22.800
was a completely
different vibe.

1225
00:57:22.867 --> 00:57:25.000
<i>What you're doing tonight</i>
<i>is saying.</i>

1226
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.867
<i>"Jesus. I'm walking out</i>
<i>of what was</i>

1227
00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:28.500
<i>into what is about to be."</i>

1228
00:57:28.567 --> 00:57:34.000
I started to definitely notice

1229
00:57:34.066 --> 00:57:35.767
a little bit of control.

1230
00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:38.600
<i>My dad told me something</i>
<i>pretty brilliant.</i>

1231
00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:40.300
<i>you can look it up.</i>
<i>It's true now.</i>

1232
00:57:40.367 --> 00:57:44.300
<i>I think over 90%</i>
<i>of a young woman's identity</i>

1233
00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:46.600
<i>comes from the words</i>
<i>of her father.</i>

1234
00:57:46.667 --> 00:57:47.631
<i>And my dad said. "You got</i>
<i>to get a hold of your girl</i>

1235
00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:48.000
<i>And my dad said. "You got</i>
<i>to get a hold of your girl</i>

1236
00:57:49.166 --> 00:57:51.100
<i>before everybody else.</i>

1237
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:52.567
<i>You got to tell her</i>
<i>who she is."</i>

1238
00:57:59.567 --> 00:58:02.266
The previous pastor was...

1239
00:58:02.266 --> 00:58:04.800
way more gentle
and compassionate

1240
00:58:04.867 --> 00:58:09.266
and understanding around
relationship dynamics.

1241
00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:12.500
So I did notice
there was a major contrast.

1242
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:17.631
There was a lot
of dating rules.

1243
00:58:17.631 --> 00:58:18.000
There was a lot
of dating rules.

1244
00:58:18.667 --> 00:58:20.367
You know.
being in a relationship.

1245
00:58:20.367 --> 00:58:23.467
there was a whole lot
of restrictions around it.

1246
00:58:23.467 --> 00:58:25.467
I'll give you a few.

1247
00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:26.967
I think it was.
"You date for a whole year

1248
00:58:26.967 --> 00:58:28.767
before you have
your first kiss

1249
00:58:28.767 --> 00:58:31.400
and then you don't say
I love you until you propose."

1250
00:58:33.166 --> 00:58:34.367
[Sammy] <i>He smiled a lot.</i>

1251
00:58:34.367 --> 00:58:36.667
<i>It was very.</i>
<i>you know. smooth.</i>

1252
00:58:36.667 --> 00:58:38.266
He was easy to get along to

1253
00:58:38.266 --> 00:58:41.066
as long as you did
what you were told.

1254
00:58:41.066 --> 00:58:45.500
I do remember feeling like
we were put in our place.

1255
00:58:45.567 --> 00:58:47.631
And. you know. this is...

1256
00:58:47.631 --> 00:58:47.767
And. you know. this is...

1257
00:58:47.767 --> 00:58:48.000
this is what you do
if you serve as a woman.

1258
00:58:50.867 --> 00:58:53.000
These are the ways you behave

1259
00:58:53.066 --> 00:58:55.266
and this is the way you dress.

1260
00:58:55.266 --> 00:58:58.066
It did feel very strict.

1261
00:58:58.066 --> 00:59:01.667
There's no little bit of sex
and a little bit of purity.

1262
00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:03.867
We gotta really live
what we believe in.

1263
00:59:03.867 --> 00:59:06.667
I did feel like in general.

1264
00:59:06.667 --> 00:59:11.400
purity just came up a lot
in preaching by Carl.

1265
00:59:11.467 --> 00:59:13.867
And yeah. it was just
basically just like.

1266
00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:16.700
"You basically are gonna have
us in your business. lady."

1267
00:59:16.767 --> 00:59:17.631
<i>You can't have</i>
<i>a little bit of you.</i>

1268
00:59:17.631 --> 00:59:18.000
<i>You can't have</i>
<i>a little bit of you.</i>

1269
00:59:18.767 --> 00:59:20.700
<i>a little bit of me</i>
<i>and a little bit of Jesus.</i>

1270
00:59:20.767 --> 00:59:22.600
<i>This is not a cocktail.</i>

1271
00:59:22.667 --> 00:59:25.166
But now. again.
as an older adult...

1272
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:27.400
I hate to say
I'm an older adult. but I do.

1273
00:59:27.467 --> 00:59:28.967
I look at it
and I'm like. "Wow.

1274
00:59:28.967 --> 00:59:32.900
If he was so concerned
with these things.

1275
00:59:32.967 --> 00:59:35.166
like. there must be
an underlying root."

1276
00:59:36.367 --> 00:59:38.066
And I know it's kind of
random to talk about purity.

1277
00:59:38.066 --> 00:59:41.000
Normally. we leave this
to the high schoolers.

1278
00:59:41.066 --> 00:59:43.400
Guess what? It still matters
when you run in churches.

1279
01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:05.100
[Doreen]
<i>I was at Wave for a few years</i>

1280
01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:06.867
{\an8}before Carl left.

1281
01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:11.367
{\an8}The impression
I always have of him.

1282
01:00:11.367 --> 01:00:13.967
I remember I would go
to leaders' meetings

1283
01:00:13.967 --> 01:00:17.631
and he would hammer
in our heads.

1284
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:18.000
and he would hammer
in our heads.

1285
01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:22.767
"Do not have sex
before marriage."

1286
01:00:22.767 --> 01:00:25.367
He was aggressive about it.

1287
01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:27.867
Lord. keep my heart pure.

1288
01:00:27.867 --> 01:00:29.266
Keep my thoughts pure.

1289
01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:30.967
Any areas of my life
that's stuck.

1290
01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:31.867
that's creeped in. Lord.

1291
01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:33.967
please help me keep
these hands clean.

1292
01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:35.800
[Doreen]
All I could think was.

1293
01:00:35.867 --> 01:00:38.767
"Man. this guy probably had
a lot of sex before marriage."

1294
01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:40.567
I think it's this concept.

1295
01:00:40.567 --> 01:00:44.700
you know. the psychological
phenomena of therapists

1296
01:00:44.767 --> 01:00:46.767
who have all these issues

1297
01:00:46.767 --> 01:00:47.631
but instead of getting help
for their issues.

1298
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:48.000
but instead of getting help
for their issues.

1299
01:00:49.467 --> 01:00:52.166
they're like.
"Hey. let me tell other people

1300
01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:53.367
they need to get help."

1301
01:00:53.367 --> 01:00:56.166
Because when you're
so vehemently

1302
01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:57.567
trying to get a point across.

1303
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.667
all you're doing
is not making your point.

1304
01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:02.867
All you're doing is like
pointing to yourself.

1305
01:01:07.867 --> 01:01:10.000
<i>Hey. girl. Hi.</i>

1306
01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:13.667
<i>I appreciate you.</i>

1307
01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:17.000
<i>I'm glad I know you</i>

1308
01:01:17.066 --> 01:01:17.631
<i>and I just don't have</i>
<i>a lot of words</i>

1309
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:18.000
<i>and I just don't have</i>
<i>a lot of words</i>

1310
01:01:18.867 --> 01:01:19.900
<i>or energy or anything.</i>

1311
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.667
<i>I don't know which way</i>
<i>is up right now.</i>

1312
01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:24.166
<i>I can't sleep.</i>
<i>I'm struggling.</i>

1313
01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:26.767
<i>But if I'm within</i>
<i>10 miles of you.</i>

1314
01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:28.667
<i>I'll come and see you.</i>

1315
01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.900
[Ranin] <i>A lot of the time.</i>
<i>he will send me videos</i>

1316
01:01:30.967 --> 01:01:33.767
speaking to the camera
because if he will text me.

1317
01:01:33.767 --> 01:01:35.000
I will not respond.

1318
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.900
So for him to create emotions.

1319
01:01:36.967 --> 01:01:39.367
he will send a video
so I can see his face.

1320
01:01:39.367 --> 01:01:41.900
<i>Yeah. So I hit you...</i>

1321
01:01:41.967 --> 01:01:43.166
<i>um...</i>

1322
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.567
<i>can I get a moment?</i>

1323
01:01:45.567 --> 01:01:46.667
<i>It's a long video.</i>

1324
01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:47.631
<i>It is what it is.</i>

1325
01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:48.000
<i>It is what it is.</i>

1326
01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:49.867
<i>Appreciate you.</i>

1327
01:01:49.867 --> 01:01:51.467
<i>So I'll talk to you soon</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

1328
01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:54.266
<i>Bye.</i>

1329
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.767
[Ranin] <i>It started in May.</i>

1330
01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:07.300
<i>It was a Friday.</i>

1331
01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:09.567
<i>I was at the park</i>
<i>by my house.</i>

1332
01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:14.300
<i>I remember he was leaning</i>
<i>on the bench. stretching.</i>

1333
01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:17.000
He was just looking at me.

1334
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.767
<i>You kind of feel like.</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1335
01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:22.600
<i>when a man like looks at you</i>
<i>different.</i>

1336
01:02:22.667 --> 01:02:24.600
watching you
and there's like this energy

1337
01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:25.700
that is hard to explain.

1338
01:02:28.767 --> 01:02:30.400
<i>He keeps staring.</i>

1339
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.200
<i>It was 6:00 almost</i>

1340
01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:34.500
<i>and the sun is about</i>
<i>to go down.</i>

1341
01:02:34.567 --> 01:02:36.967
<i>I was like. "Okay. I think</i>
<i>it's time for me to go."</i>

1342
01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.867
And he start walking with me.

1343
01:02:42.767 --> 01:02:44.767
<i>So we were. like.</i>
<i>we had a nice chat.</i>

1344
01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:46.567
<i>He said to me.</i>
<i>"You're from the Middle East.</i>

1345
01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:47.631
<i>The most beautiful women</i>
<i>come from the Middle East."</i>

1346
01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:48.000
<i>The most beautiful women</i>
<i>come from the Middle East."</i>

1347
01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:50.600
<i>And then we kept walking</i>

1348
01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.867
<i>and he asked me</i>
<i>a bunch of questions.</i>

1349
01:02:52.867 --> 01:02:54.166
<i>I was like. "We just met</i>

1350
01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:55.400
<i>like. you know.</i>
<i>you need to chill."</i>

1351
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.000
<i>We walked towards at the end</i>
<i>of the... of the park</i>

1352
01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.567
and I was like.
"Yeah. I'm gonna...

1353
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:00.867
I'm gonna go this way."

1354
01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:02.600
and he's like.
"Yeah. I'm gonna go that way."

1355
01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:04.567
<i>And he grabbed his phone</i>
<i>and he said...</i>

1356
01:03:04.567 --> 01:03:06.166
<i>He asked me to write</i>
<i>my information.</i>

1357
01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:08.266
<i>but I wrote it on his note...</i>
<i>on his note section.</i>

1358
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.367
<i>Um...</i>

1359
01:03:12.367 --> 01:03:13.567
I felt really weird because

1360
01:03:13.567 --> 01:03:14.667
usually when guys ask me
for my number.

1361
01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:15.700
they don't put it
on their notes.

1362
01:03:17.667 --> 01:03:18.000
I said. "Can you send me
your last name

1363
01:03:19.066 --> 01:03:20.400
because I would. like.
to save you in the phone."

1364
01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:22.266
He said.
"Oh. you know...you know.

1365
01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:24.000
like. when people Google
people it's like...

1366
01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.200
It's not a good look.

1367
01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:26.266
It's better to get to know
the person

1368
01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:27.467
before you look them up."

1369
01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:29.567
I'm like. "That was the
weirdest answer I ever heard."

1370
01:03:30.467 --> 01:03:32.066
<i>But I'm very picky</i>

1371
01:03:32.066 --> 01:03:33.567
<i>when it comes to who</i>
<i>I'm attracted to</i>

1372
01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:35.166
<i>and I know that</i>
<i>with this situation.</i>

1373
01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.467
<i>it was very different.</i>

1374
01:03:36.467 --> 01:03:38.100
<i>I did feel attracted to him.</i>

1375
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.767
<i>And he said.</i>
<i>"I'll text you later.</i>

1376
01:03:39.767 --> 01:03:42.200
If you're free we can...
we can have some tequila."

1377
01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:43.400
That's what he said.

1378
01:03:43.467 --> 01:03:44.767
And I was like.
"Okay. Sounds good."

1379
01:03:44.767 --> 01:03:46.800
<i>So I walked home and I...</i>

1380
01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:47.631
At this point. I had to. like.
look him up.

1381
01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:48.000
At this point. I had to. like.
look him up.

1382
01:03:52.667 --> 01:03:53.567
<i>I was like. "Oh. my God.</i>

1383
01:03:53.567 --> 01:03:54.734
<i>I'm gonna find out</i>
<i>this person.</i>

1384
01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:55.800
<i>I mean. I'm not gonna</i>
<i>hang out with him tomorrow</i>

1385
01:03:55.867 --> 01:03:56.867
<i>if I don't know who he is.</i>

1386
01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:59.467
So I went to... I went online

1387
01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:03.000
and I found this way
to. like. look up numbers

1388
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.500
and that can give you
everything about this person.

1389
01:04:05.567 --> 01:04:07.667
<i>And when it did come up.</i>
<i>and I was like.</i>

1390
01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:10.266
<i>"Oh. my God.</i>
<i>I've seen this guy before."</i>

1391
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.800
<i>I've seen him</i>
<i>when I went to the church.</i>

1392
01:04:13.867 --> 01:04:15.400
<i>What do I want more?</i>

1393
01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:17.631
<i>Do I want this happy.</i>
<i>worldly. fleshly stuff</i>

1394
01:04:17.631 --> 01:04:18.000
<i>Do I want this happy.</i>
<i>worldly. fleshly stuff</i>

1395
01:04:19.467 --> 01:04:22.667
<i>or do I actually want more</i>
<i>of Jesus?</i>

1396
01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.100
[Ranin]
<i>When I was going through</i>
<i>a divorce.</i>

1397
01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:25.867
my good friend took me there

1398
01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:27.900
because I was really depressed
and I was going through it.

1399
01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.367
<i>Matthew Chapter Five.</i>

1400
01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:31.900
<i>Do we have anybody who's.</i>
<i>like. brand new to our church</i>

1401
01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:33.200
<i>to check this stuff out</i>

1402
01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:34.500
<i>and see that</i>
<i>it'll give you a way.</i>

1403
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.767
It was funny to me how. like.
I got to see this individual

1404
01:04:37.767 --> 01:04:40.667
or kind of know of him
years ago

1405
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:41.767
and all of a sudden

1406
01:04:41.767 --> 01:04:43.500
he's in front of my face.
right?

1407
01:04:43.567 --> 01:04:45.000
<i>He messaged me.</i>

1408
01:04:45.066 --> 01:04:47.000
[phone beeps]

1409
01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:47.631
[Ranin] <i>I said to him.</i>
<i>"Are you married?"</i>

1410
01:04:47.631 --> 01:04:48.000
[Ranin] <i>I said to him.</i>
<i>"Are you married?"</i>

1411
01:04:48.767 --> 01:04:50.867
And he said. "Yes."
And I said. "For how long?"

1412
01:04:50.867 --> 01:04:52.767
He said. "For 17 years."

1413
01:04:52.767 --> 01:04:54.800
<i>And. like.</i>
<i>at the end of the day.</i>

1414
01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:58.166
we all end up falling
to a place

1415
01:04:58.166 --> 01:04:59.667
where we're attracted
to something.

1416
01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:02.567
and then.
you kind of play yourself

1417
01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.100
because. you know. you go...

1418
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.567
You're walking into where
you shouldn't be walking.

1419
01:05:10.367 --> 01:05:13.400
When something is unreachable.
you want it more. right?

1420
01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.266
<i>He end up coming to my house.</i>

1421
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.900
<i>I told him.</i>
<i>"Listen. you know.</i>
<i>I'm not judging you.</i>

1422
01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:23.767
but I wanted to tell you
that I have looked you up

1423
01:05:23.767 --> 01:05:25.000
and I know who you are."

1424
01:05:27.767 --> 01:05:29.500
<i>I just wanted to know. like.</i>

1425
01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:31.367
<i>there is anything wrong</i>
<i>with your relationship?</i>

1426
01:05:31.367 --> 01:05:33.000
<i>Why are you here?</i>

1427
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.667
Like. why are you
in this position.

1428
01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:36.166
like. when you're sitting
in my house?

1429
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:39.367
He was like. "I never have
done this before.

1430
01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:41.066
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>in my relationship."</i>

1431
01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:43.467
<i>He's like.</i>
<i>"I know when I see someone</i>

1432
01:05:43.467 --> 01:05:45.200
<i>and like when I saw you.</i>

1433
01:05:45.266 --> 01:05:47.631
like. you have everything
I want in a woman."

1434
01:05:47.631 --> 01:05:47.767
like. you have everything
I want in a woman."

1435
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.000
For me it's like very odd.

1436
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.000
<i>I feel attracted</i>
<i>to this individual.</i>

1437
01:05:54.066 --> 01:05:56.367
Obviously.
this is a danger zone.

1438
01:05:56.367 --> 01:05:58.567
<i>but then also ask yourself.</i>
<i>why will be me.</i>

1439
01:05:58.567 --> 01:05:59.767
<i>the girl that saw him</i>

1440
01:05:59.767 --> 01:06:02.467
when I was broken in 2013.

1441
01:06:03.467 --> 01:06:06.266
<i>Then years after.</i>
<i>the same person.</i>

1442
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.266
you see him at the park

1443
01:06:07.266 --> 01:06:09.066
like what is the coincidence
that happens?

1444
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.200
<i>Because he keeps saying</i>
<i>a lot that</i>

1445
01:06:12.266 --> 01:06:13.567
we're so similar me and him.

1446
01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:15.767
that we found each other
because we're both broken.

1447
01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.631
<i>And there is sense in that</i>
<i>when he said it.</i>

1448
01:06:17.631 --> 01:06:17.867
<i>And there is sense in that</i>
<i>when he said it.</i>

1449
01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:18.000
because
I'm a very big believer

1450
01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:23.166
that those coincidence
are made to happen.

1451
01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:26.500
like. I think
I did had a purpose here.

1452
01:06:27.467 --> 01:06:29.266
Something in me told me
like this is...

1453
01:06:29.266 --> 01:06:33.266
this is like such a huge
and strong connection.

1454
01:06:33.266 --> 01:06:35.467
We met on Friday. Saturday.

1455
01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:36.967
I saw him briefly at the park.

1456
01:06:36.967 --> 01:06:41.166
And then Sunday evening
when he came to my house.

1457
01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:43.367
That was the first time that
we actually got to. like...

1458
01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:44.900
<i>We got to kiss.</i>

1459
01:06:45.867 --> 01:06:47.631
<i>Oh. hey. girl.</i>

1460
01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:48.000
<i>Oh. hey. girl.</i>

1461
01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:50.000
Hi.

1462
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.400
Hey. girl. I'm just flipping
through my <i>Bible</i>

1463
01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:56.100
and it's incomplete

1464
01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:57.600
because
I'm in the Book of Numbers

1465
01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:59.166
and yours isn't in there.

1466
01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:00.867
Hey. girl.

1467
01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:05.266
[Doreen]
Yes. a number of times.

1468
01:07:05.266 --> 01:07:08.767
I had a friend who Carl tried
to sleep with her.

1469
01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:13.200
It was a very. very
known thing about Carl.

1470
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.967
<i>I think people like him</i>

1471
01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:17.631
<i>are just very intuitive</i>

1472
01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:18.000
<i>are just very intuitive</i>

1473
01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:22.500
of where they can go to prey.

1474
01:07:22.567 --> 01:07:23.867
P-R-E-Y.

1475
01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.000
My interactions with Carl

1476
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.266
quickly became negative
by. like. 19.

1477
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.667
<i>Me and the guy</i>
<i>that I was dating.</i>

1478
01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:48.400
{\an8}we'd been dating a year
at least and we...

1479
01:07:48.467 --> 01:07:49.867
{\an8}I don't wanna say
fell into sin

1480
01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:51.400
{\an8}because we made a decision

1481
01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:54.767
{\an8}to. you know.
have an intimate moment.

1482
01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:57.100
I mean. we both felt guilty
immediately after.

1483
01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.266
We were so young

1484
01:07:58.266 --> 01:08:00.379
and we really did love
the Lord.

1485
01:08:00.379 --> 01:08:00.500
and we really did love
the Lord.

1486
01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:01.000
We really did.

1487
01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:03.100
And we loved each other too.

1488
01:08:07.266 --> 01:08:09.500
<i>At the end of a service.</i>

1489
01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:11.667
<i>there's usually an invitation</i>

1490
01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:14.700
<i>to ask Jesus to come into</i>
<i>your life for the first time</i>

1491
01:08:14.767 --> 01:08:18.066
or to return back
to your faith

1492
01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:19.467
<i>if you've left it.</i>

1493
01:08:19.467 --> 01:08:22.200
<i>There's an invitation</i>
<i>to come out of your seat</i>

1494
01:08:22.266 --> 01:08:23.767
<i>and come down to the front.</i>

1495
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.467
<i>My boyfriend raised his hand</i>

1496
01:08:28.467 --> 01:08:29.800
at the end of the service
for the altar call.

1497
01:08:29.867 --> 01:08:30.379
And I'm like. "Crap."

1498
01:08:30.379 --> 01:08:31.000
And I'm like. "Crap."

1499
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.900
<i>So I raised my hand</i>
<i>and we went forward together.</i>

1500
01:08:38.767 --> 01:08:40.266
<i>Then there's an invitation</i>

1501
01:08:40.266 --> 01:08:42.667
<i>to a room</i>
<i>that's a little quieter.</i>

1502
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.667
<i>It was me and my boyfriend.</i>
<i>Carl Lentz.</i>

1503
01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:52.200
<i>No female was present</i>
<i>and Carl led the discussion.</i>

1504
01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:56.266
<i>So we shared that</i>
<i>we had slept together.</i>

1505
01:08:56.266 --> 01:08:59.767
<i>We were very forthcoming</i>
<i>about our sin.</i>

1506
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.000
It was literally one time

1507
01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:06.100
and Carl asked.
"Did you use protection?"

1508
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.400
And I interrupted. "Yes."

1509
01:09:08.467 --> 01:09:11.000
You know. like. of course
we use protection. you know.

1510
01:09:11.066 --> 01:09:13.700
And his next response was.

1511
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.567
"Huh. well then
it was premeditated."

1512
01:09:20.767 --> 01:09:23.100
<i>There's nothing good</i>
<i>that is gonna come out</i>

1513
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.367
<i>of that conversation</i>
<i>with Carl</i>

1514
01:09:25.367 --> 01:09:27.166
<i>when you're admitting</i>
<i>your fault.</i>

1515
01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:28.967
<i>but I kind of expected</i>

1516
01:09:28.967 --> 01:09:30.379
a different response from him.

1517
01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:30.467
a different response from him.

1518
01:09:30.467 --> 01:09:31.000
<i>to be honest.</i>

1519
01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:35.567
<i>I just went from</i>

1520
01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:39.200
<i>sharing something so personal</i>
<i>with you.</i>

1521
01:09:39.266 --> 01:09:40.567
and now my answer.

1522
01:09:40.567 --> 01:09:42.100
you're using it to shame me
and condemn me.

1523
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.567
<i>It went from listening</i>
<i>to then.</i>

1524
01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:56.100
"You are off the worship team
for six months and choir.

1525
01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:58.967
you are off your team."
what he was doing.

1526
01:09:58.967 --> 01:10:00.379
"We do not think
you guys should date.

1527
01:10:00.379 --> 01:10:01.000
"We do not think
you guys should date.

1528
01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:04.800
You should not text.
call for at least six months."

1529
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:12.467
And. yeah. I mean.
it still chokes me up

1530
01:10:12.467 --> 01:10:16.266
because we could have
walked out of that meeting

1531
01:10:16.266 --> 01:10:19.066
and said. "F this place."
[laughs]

1532
01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:20.667
Baby. let's go somewhere else.

1533
01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:22.166
We can find another church.

1534
01:10:24.166 --> 01:10:26.867
<i>But no. we walked out</i>
<i>of that service</i>

1535
01:10:26.867 --> 01:10:30.166
and we were broken up.

1536
01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.900
<i>We were conditioned.</i>

1537
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.000
<i>When you go to this church</i>

1538
01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:42.667
<i>and it's this prosperity.</i>
<i>success.</i>

1539
01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:46.266
<i>like this is</i>
<i>what we're chasing...</i>

1540
01:10:49.066 --> 01:10:52.000
it doesn't seem controlling

1541
01:10:52.066 --> 01:10:55.400
to submit certain things.

1542
01:10:55.467 --> 01:10:58.367
So it's very easy.
is my point.

1543
01:10:58.367 --> 01:10:59.667
It's very easy.

1544
01:10:59.667 --> 01:11:00.379
It was very easy for me
to submit.

1545
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:01.000
It was very easy for me
to submit.

1546
01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:10.266
[man] <i>Can you give us</i>
<i>a timeline</i>

1547
01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.567
of how long you and Carl
were together?

1548
01:11:12.567 --> 01:11:14.100
Five... It was five months.

1549
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.400
So me and Carl were together
for like five months.

1550
01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.166
<i>He kept coming to my house.</i>

1551
01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:24.767
Then at some point.
he took off his necklace.

1552
01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:26.967
<i>He was wearing</i>
<i>an eagle pendant.</i>

1553
01:11:26.967 --> 01:11:30.100
and he gave me the pendant
and he started crying

1554
01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:30.379
and he said he feels

1555
01:11:30.379 --> 01:11:31.000
and he said he feels

1556
01:11:32.767 --> 01:11:34.867
<i>something about him</i>
<i>not being vulnerable.</i>

1557
01:11:34.867 --> 01:11:37.667
<i>but being around me</i>
<i>make him feel vulnerable.</i>

1558
01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:40.000
I mean. later on.
I realized it's bull [bleep]

1559
01:11:40.066 --> 01:11:41.667
people that went
to the church say

1560
01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:43.166
he cries all the time
on stage.

1561
01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.700
I remember sitting there
tears on my eyes.

1562
01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.166
I don't know why I'm so weepy.

1563
01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.667
I love people.

1564
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.867
{\an8}If you're wondering about
emotionally unstable.
absolutely.

1565
01:11:52.867 --> 01:11:55.467
{\an8}-This is fake.
-[laughing]

1566
01:11:55.467 --> 01:11:57.367
{\an8}It's all for show.

1567
01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:00.379
[Ranin] <i>I got to know him</i>

1568
01:12:00.379 --> 01:12:01.000
[Ranin] <i>I got to know him</i>

1569
01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:04.400
<i>more than I think</i>
<i>anybody else got to know him.</i>

1570
01:12:04.467 --> 01:12:06.100
And I think...

1571
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.066
he was the main...

1572
01:12:09.066 --> 01:12:10.767
He was the character
of his own show

1573
01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:12.000
and then I was a...

1574
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.567
I was just an add-on.
you know?

1575
01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.467
He always wanted to feel
like he's somebody.

1576
01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:22.567
<i>You know.</i>
<i>I never have been part</i>

1577
01:12:22.567 --> 01:12:24.867
of the Christian culture
like that.

1578
01:12:24.867 --> 01:12:27.667
I don't know what
he really does at the church.

1579
01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:30.379
All I know is that
his persona. his chaos.

1580
01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.000
All I know is that
his persona. his chaos.

1581
01:12:32.667 --> 01:12:33.867
brought chaos in to my life.

1582
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.667
<i>Those who live according</i>
<i>to the flesh</i>

1583
01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:41.467
have their mind set
on what the flesh desires.

1584
01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:44.367
The mind governed by the flesh
is death.

1585
01:12:44.367 --> 01:12:48.400
but the mind governed by
the spirit is life in peace.

1586
01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.166
[Jaclyn]
<i>With that whole purity thing.</i>

1587
01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:56.166
<i>when you mess up.</i>

1588
01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:57.867
it's not like there's no hope

1589
01:12:57.867 --> 01:12:59.200
because then there's...

1590
01:12:59.266 --> 01:13:00.379
But there's marriage.

1591
01:13:00.379 --> 01:13:01.000
But there's marriage.

1592
01:13:01.066 --> 01:13:02.767
So marriage
is the new shiny penny.

1593
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.700
<i>After Carl had</i>
<i>the conversation with us.</i>

1594
01:13:07.767 --> 01:13:12.100
there wasn't really a lot of
closure for me and that guy.

1595
01:13:13.767 --> 01:13:15.467
Fast forward
to my first marriage.

1596
01:13:15.467 --> 01:13:17.867
which was only a year later.

1597
01:13:19.266 --> 01:13:23.900
<i>That same broken.</i>
<i>immature girl is now married.</i>

1598
01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.467
<i>I married after being</i>
<i>with him for three months</i>

1599
01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:30.266
because we had sex
and we were...

1600
01:13:30.266 --> 01:13:30.379
we were basically
gonna be asked

1601
01:13:30.379 --> 01:13:31.000
we were basically
gonna be asked

1602
01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:33.600
to break up or whatever.

1603
01:13:33.667 --> 01:13:34.867
And so we ran off

1604
01:13:34.867 --> 01:13:36.400
and went to the courthouse
and got married.

1605
01:13:36.467 --> 01:13:40.567
It was either me
coming forward again with.

1606
01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:42.066
"I had sex again."

1607
01:13:42.066 --> 01:13:44.266
or coming back with husband.

1608
01:13:44.266 --> 01:13:46.900
That relationship
was definitely.

1609
01:13:46.967 --> 01:13:48.367
you know. difficult

1610
01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:52.200
for a 21-year-old
and a 23-year-old to handle

1611
01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:54.900
and we were married
about seven or eight years.

1612
01:13:54.967 --> 01:13:57.567
And. you know.
that ended very hard.

1613
01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.379
And. you know. that was...
that was very difficult.

1614
01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:01.000
And. you know. that was...
that was very difficult.

01:14:34.767 --> 01:14:36.767
[Ranin]
<i>Throughout the months that</i>
<i>we were seeing each other.</i>

1626
01:14:36.767 --> 01:14:39.066
it got to the point
where I started to realize

1627
01:14:39.066 --> 01:14:41.266
he does things that
is always convenient for him.

1628
01:14:41.266 --> 01:14:44.066
He always gives a timeframe
when he can do things.

1629
01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:46.400
I fell into the...
A place where. like.

1630
01:14:46.467 --> 01:14:48.867
I will wanted to hang out.
you know. with him

1631
01:14:48.867 --> 01:14:50.867
and then he wouldn't be able
to do that.

1632
01:14:50.867 --> 01:14:52.367
And it's starting
to occur to me

1633
01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:54.867
that it's always
his way or no way.

1634
01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:59.166
It got to the point where
I will send him novels

1635
01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.379
of like. "Goodbye.

1636
01:15:00.379 --> 01:15:00.667
of like. "Goodbye.

1637
01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:01.000
I wish I never met you
on the park."

1638
01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:03.867
<i>We used to argue a lot.</i>

1639
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.200
<i>And when I started</i>
<i>to pull back and say.</i>

1640
01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:09.567
<i>"I don't want this anymore.</i>
<i>leave me alone."</i>

1641
01:15:09.567 --> 01:15:11.266
he wants to know
that if he's...

1642
01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:12.767
If you're walking away
from him.

1643
01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:14.066
he's not gonna
let you walk away.

1644
01:15:14.066 --> 01:15:15.266
He needs to be the first one.

1645
01:15:15.266 --> 01:15:18.367
<i>We have like an outlandishly</i>

1646
01:15:18.367 --> 01:15:21.100
<i>complex relationship</i>

1647
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.000
<i>and nothing</i>
<i>has ever been normal.</i>

1648
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:26.266
[Ranin]
<i>The more you say no to him.</i>

1649
01:15:26.266 --> 01:15:28.100
<i>the more he kept coming back.</i>

1650
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:29.967
[Carl] <i>Here's my dilemma.</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>

1651
01:15:29.967 --> 01:15:30.379
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

1652
01:15:30.379 --> 01:15:31.000
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

1653
01:15:31.367 --> 01:15:33.867
<i>wondering</i>
<i>if you're okay today.</i>

1654
01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:35.600
<i>And didn't know</i>
<i>if I should text</i>

1655
01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:39.166
<i>or if it's worse for me</i>
<i>to check. not check.</i>

1656
01:15:39.166 --> 01:15:41.667
So you're starting
to understand this person

1657
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.367
cannot lose a battle.

1658
01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:46.467
<i>If it's okay</i>
<i>from time to time</i>

1659
01:15:46.467 --> 01:15:49.567
<i>for me to let you know</i>
<i>I'm thinking about you</i>

1660
01:15:49.567 --> 01:15:51.867
<i>and hope you're okay.</i>
<i>I would like to.</i>

1661
01:15:51.867 --> 01:15:54.867
<i>I'm genuinely</i>
<i>asking you what's...</i>

1662
01:15:54.867 --> 01:15:56.567
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1663
01:15:56.567 --> 01:15:59.767
<i>Because if it's easier</i>
<i>for you just to move on</i>

1664
01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:00.379
<i>and me not say.</i>
<i>"Hey. how are you</i>

1665
01:16:00.379 --> 01:16:01.000
<i>and me not say.</i>
<i>"Hey. how are you</i>

1666
01:16:01.467 --> 01:16:04.100
<i>or how was your day</i>
<i>or I think about you."</i>

1667
01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:07.367
<i>and let you know.</i>
<i>I won't do that.</i>

1668
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.467
[Ranin] <i>But then he said</i>
<i>something that triggered me.</i>

1669
01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:13.367
He said. "You know.
at the end of the day.

1670
01:16:13.367 --> 01:16:15.900
I go to my family
and you go to nothing."

1671
01:16:17.967 --> 01:16:20.567
And I was like. "Wow.
that's a slap in the face."

1672
01:16:23.467 --> 01:16:24.567
<i>I started to realize</i>

1673
01:16:24.567 --> 01:16:26.867
<i>there's things</i>
<i>that people say</i>

1674
01:16:26.867 --> 01:16:29.100
<i>that they feel</i>
<i>they have power over you.</i>

1675
01:16:30.367 --> 01:16:30.379
It was the most toxic thing
I ever had to deal with.

1676
01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:31.000
It was the most toxic thing
I ever had to deal with.

1677
01:16:33.867 --> 01:16:35.867
It was really unhealthy.

1678
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.967
It just brought a lot of pain
into my life. you know.

1679
01:16:40.967 --> 01:16:42.266
because I always said.

1680
01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:44.300
"If I can go back
and never meet Carl. I would."

1681
01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:47.467
It's not like something that
I wanted to happen in my life.

1682
01:16:47.467 --> 01:16:49.300
It just happened.

1683
01:16:50.467 --> 01:16:53.667
<i>So I'll talk to you</i>
<i>soon for sure.</i>

1684
01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:56.266
<i>Might knock on your door.</i>
<i>You never know.</i>

1685
01:16:56.266 --> 01:16:57.367
<i>Bye.</i>
