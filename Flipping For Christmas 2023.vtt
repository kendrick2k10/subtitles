Tear it down. No. no.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.179
Just the wall between the
kitchen and the dining room.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.015
Then add the marble tile
and the backsplash

behind the counter.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.851
Added like $15K
to the asking price.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.478
Oh. sorry. I got to
wrap this up.

11
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.313
I'm pitching a
new client shortly.

DevaCore. Thanks. Bye.

All set. Sparkling

Great. He's the CEO of DevaCore.

16
00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.580
This is a really big deal.

17
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.330
Okay. let's stay focused.

18
00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.415
He'll be here any minute.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.167
How did you land this pitch.
anyway?

20
00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.418
My old college friend works
there.

I'm going to take this.

and I'll be right behind you.

-Hey Claire.

25
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.096
Sorry to bug you. but we've got
a bit of a situation.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.223
Whew! Endless energy.
these kids.

27
00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.683
Oh. dad's fine.

28
00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.560
In fact. he wants to say hi.

29
00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.228
I gotta find the pliers.

30
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.146
Dad. it'll take two seconds.

31
00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:05.565
Guys. I only have. like. a
minute before I have to go.

32
00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.733
Hi. Abby.

33
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.026
I'm fine.

34
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.736
Your sister's got me
living in the guest house.

35
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.237
It's the garage. Dad.

36
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.822
[Edward] I just try to stay
out of the way

37
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.200
while
I get ready for Christmas.

38
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.493
I'm sure
you're not in the way. Dad.

39
00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.661
Listen. I'm
just prepping for a meeting.

40
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.705
so you know how that goes.

41
00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.457
Right.

42
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.250
Hello?

43
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.710
Sorry.

44
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.129
He's having a hard time
with Mom being gone.

45
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.216
Anyway. John and I
are in a bit of a bind.

46
00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.134
and we could really use
your help.

47
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.512
Is there any chance
that you could come over

48
00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.473
for the holidays
early. like tomorrow morning?

49
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.933
John's Grandpa Frank
passed away.

50
00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.851
He was 104.
so we all saw it coming.

51
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.353
But Grandpa

52
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.106
Frank left John his home and
we take possession tomorrow

53
00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.649
and we want to fix it up
and flip it.

54
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.275
which you are so good at.

55
00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.236
And then with the extra money.
we want to build

56
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.780
an extension here
with an actual space for Dad.

57
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.782
Because right now. you know.
I love him to death.

58
00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.201
but sometimes I could actually
love him to death.

59
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.578
Wow. that was a lot.

60
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.039
Let me see how today goes
and then I'll circle back.

61
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.500
But no promises. Okay?

62
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.752
Love you. Bye.

all about.

Antonio.
very nice to meet you.

67
00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:21.725
Thank you.

Blair has been singing
your praises.

69
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.644
Thank goodness
for social media.

70
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.688
because all you seem to
do is work these days.

71
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.440
It's a labour of love.

72
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.191
This is quite a nice office.

73
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.776
Beautifully done.

74
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.653
It's my home away from home.

75
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.822
I see you've met my assistant.
Jessica.

76
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:36.906
I think you're going to love

77
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.116
the presentation
we've created for you.

78
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.659
I'm looking forward to it.

79
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:40.994
-Shall we?
-Please.

80
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:41.870
After you.

81
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.790
Hey. good luck.

82
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.666
You nail it.

83
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.917
you make me look like a hero.

84
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.211
Please don't mess this up.

Working
with an established company

87
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.808
like DevaCore
would be a perfect fit.

88
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.269
I owe a lot of my company's
success to my upbringing.

89
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.772
My mom loved interior design.
and my dad

90
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.024
always says. "You don't stop
when you're tired.

91
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.275
You stop when you're done."

92
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.194
Something we've taken on
as our motto here.

93
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.029
Which is why I've been able
to provide families

94
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.322
with beautiful homes

95
00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.533
while always staying
focused on profit and ROI.

96
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.242
Impressive.

97
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.036
See? She is great.

98
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.121
I told you. I did tell you.

99
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.415
You know.
we have a lot in common.

100
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.417
You flip
houses only to recognize

101
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.710
something that lacks value.

102
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.046
and then you breathe
new life into it.

103
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.881
which is exactly what we do.

104
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.966
Only on a larger scale.

105
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.554

development.

107
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.102
The plan is to break ground
early next year

108
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.020
and be move-in
ready by year end.

109
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.314
We start pre-sales next month.

110
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.900
What do you think?

111
00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.902
It's beautiful.

112
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487
I had a vision

113
00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.572
to reimagine the neighborhood.

114
00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.034
Of course. gentrification
sometimes comes at a cost.

115
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.120
You have to break a few eggs
to make an omelet. right?

116
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.372
We need someone
we can count on.

117
00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.250
Someone who can see value
where others see nothing

118
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.418
at all.

119
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.044
A real professional
who isn't undeterred

120
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.755
by little inconveniences like

121
00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.382
holiday shutdowns.

122
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.425
Wait. I'm sorry.

123
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.926
We're
working over the holidays?

124
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.970
I'm kind of a 24/7 person. so

125
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.472
regardless of the season.
I'm always on the job.

126
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.599
Well. then we just found
our person. Yes.

127
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.727

128
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.936
Congratulations.

129
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.937
Thanks. Antonio.

130
00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.564
I won't let you down.

131
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.442
We'll be in touch

132
00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.028
[Blair] After you. sir.

133
00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.030
Nailed it.

134
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.448
This is huge for us.

135
00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.116
An awesome Christmas present.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.660
-I love this time of year.
-I suppose.

137
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:46.911
Come on.

Oh. I'm sorry.

142
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.296
No. it's okay.

143
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.131
It's just a bit weird
this year.

144
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.258
I know I'm not a kid anymore.
but the first Christmas

145
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.719
without my mom is different.

146
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.013
Of course. I understand.

147
00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:05.972
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.223
Do you want to
talk about it?

149
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.808
No. Let's just focus on work.

150
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.310
Right? Okay.

151
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.644
Should I start setting up
pre-sale meetings

152
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.188
-for after the break?
-Sure.

153
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.189
Sounds good.

And it looks like

156
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.819
I'll need to work remotely
for the next couple of days.

157
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.904
Oh.

158
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:21.696

okay to hold down the fort?

Hey. Dad.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.420
Did you want to help us
decorate?

163
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.631
I'm not much of a decorator.

164
00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.095
How come he didn't
want to help us decorate?

165
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.388
Oh. well.

166
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.847
I just think that
Grandpa needs some quiet time.

167
00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.100
so we should give him
some privacy.

reopening?

Yeah.

Ten minutes.

178
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.193
No. I know. I meant
when did they put the sign up?

179
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.820
Just before she left.

180
00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:45.739
Right. But if she left. like.

eight minutes ago.
she'll be back in two minutes.

182
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.534
And if she left two minutes ago.
she'll be back in eight minutes.

183
00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.786
So do you know what time
she left?

184
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.581
I know that it was less
than ten minutes ago.

185
00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:58.418
Right. But does it feel like
she just left a minute ago or

186
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.961
more like she's been gone
for a while?

187
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.755
-Yes.
-Which?

188
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.923
-What?
-A short time or a long time?

189
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.383
Since she left or
until she's back?

190
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.968
That's what I'm asking you.

191
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.596
You know what? Forget it.

192
00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.139
Is there somewhere else I can
grab coffee?

193
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.017
Somewhere else? Yeah.
let me think. Oh.

194
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.478
There's a diner just
on the other side of town.

195
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.355
Great. And how far is that?

196
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.272
Oh. it's about--

197
00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.857
About ten minutes.

198
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.777
You're enjoying this.

199
00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:24.611
aren't you?

200
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.321
A scale of

201
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.281
one to ten. maybe a nine.

202
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.199
Really?

203
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.284
Thanks for watching.

204
00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.327
The place was out of milk.

205
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.745
No problem.

206
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.705
You were a big help.

207
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:36.664
Anytime.

208
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.667
[bright music]

209
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.100
[door creaks]

210
00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.270
Hello?

211
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.148
Aunt Abby!

212
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.776
Hey. guys!

213
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.653
-Hey. Abby!
-Hey.

214
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:07.821
How are you. little rascals?

215
00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.988
Are you excited for Christmas?

216
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.323
[both] Yeah.

217
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.825
Claire's
in the kitchen. Kiddos.

218
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.660
How about we get ready
for dinner and let Aunty Abby

219
00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.161
and your mom catch up?

220
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.833
I'm so sorry to hear
about your grandfather.

221
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:20.834
Thanks.

222
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.502
He was a pretty great guy.

223
00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.713
I was surprised at
104 years old.

224
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.715
but still a big loss for us.

225
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.718
-Of course.
-Come on in

226
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.679
-Let me get that.
-Thank you.

227
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.557
[door slams]

228
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:37.517
And he shook my hand and said.

229
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.185
"Congratulations.
you're our new realtor."

230
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.520
Biggest account of my career.

231
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.398
Wow. that's amazing.

232
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.233
-Abby.
-Hey. Dad.

233
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.319
Dad. Abby was just telling me
about this massive account

234
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.362
she just landed.

235
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.364
She's a chip off
the old block.

236
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.491
Congratulations. kiddo.

237
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.368
Thanks. here. Come
sit down and chat.

238
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.202
I haven't seen you in weeks.

239
00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.203
I can't right now.

240
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.580
I'm kind of busy.

241
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.497
Everything okay?

242
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.707
Yeah. it's all good.

243
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.042
I'll see you later.

244
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.377
You know that
he's proud of you.

245
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.837
-Yeah.
-He's just...

246
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.589
He's just going through a lot
right now.

247
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.342
I mean. imagine losing
your company. your pension.

248
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.927
and your wife
all back to back.

249
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.472
Also. it's the first Christmas

250
00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.098
without mom. so.

251
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.604
But she would have been
all over you.

252
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.230
"Oh! My little munchkin.

253
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.108
Businesswoman.
Buttercup."

254
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.276
[both laughing]

255
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.488
What's
he so busy doing out there?

256
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.864
No idea.

257
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.367
Every time I ask he just
says he's sorting stuff out.

258
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.451
Always the organizer.

259
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.827
I suppose

260
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.288
He's not even joining us
for dinner?

261
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.373
I offered.

262
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.375
But anyway. thank you

263
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.085
for coming home early.

264
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.171
So. tell me about this flip.

265
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.006
What do I need to know
about the property?

266
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.758
Are you hungry?

267
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.135
We should eat.

268
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.514
Aren't these?

269
00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.099
Yeah.

270
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.143
Mom loved this set.

271
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.770
I'm trying to carry

272
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.022
on her traditions.

273
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.150
[oven beeps]

274
00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.235
Dinner!

275
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.029
[bright music]

276
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.370
Well. did you tell her?

277
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.288
-Not yet.
-Claire!

278
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.082
She needs to know.

279
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.542
This is kind of a big wrinkle
we need to have

280
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.210
-ironed out.
-I know. I just.

281
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.462
I haven't found the right time
to tell her.

282
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.131
I'll tell her over dinner.

283
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.382
Okay great.

284
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.594
So she's going to be selling

285
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.638
like a thousand condo units.

286
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.640
Well. 100. actually.

287
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.684
Still. that's a big deal.

288
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.310
I don't know how you handle
that kind of workload.

289
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.520
You must be exhausted.

290
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.105
Well.
it's like Dad always says.

291
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.606
"You don't stop
when you're tired.

292
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.108
You stop when you're done."

293
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.151
Done what?

294
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.154
-Pardon?
-You stop when you're done what?

295
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.824
Well. I guess

296
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.784
whatever it is
that you're doing.

297
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.830
Great Grandpa Frank used to
always tell us to stop and smell

298
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.749
-stuff.
-Flowers.

299
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.709
Stop and smell the flowers.

300
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:11.171
Oh. right. So. was Great Grandpa
Frank wrong?

301
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.174
No. no--

302
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.676
Great Grandpa Frank wasn't wrong
and neither is your Aunt Abby.

303
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.386
Everybody sees things
differently.

304
00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.220
That's it.

305
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.515
I'm sorry again about Frank.

306
00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.476
He was quite the character.

307
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.686
a real fixture
in the community.

308
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:27.896
We'll show you
the house in the morning.

309
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.147
and hopefully
it'll be a quick flip

310
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.191
so we can get the profit
to build an extension

311
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.402
on this house.
which we desperately need.

312
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.321
Frank would loved knowing
how much this is going to help

313
00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:37.489
our family.

314
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.907
Well. I'm sure
it'll be quick and simple.

315
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.661
I think this
could use a little cheese.

316
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.954
Who wants Parmesan?

317
00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.873
-[kids] Me!
-[Claire laughs] Okay.

318
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.880
Wow. The porch is huge.

319
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.924
You still haven't told her.

320
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:56.966
I couldn't find the right time.

321
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.052
He's going to be here
any minute.

322
00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.262
Beautiful. Really well-kept.

323
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.389
Frank loved this place.

324
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.015
it was his pride and joy.

325
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:07.227
But he was 104.
so the interior is a little

326
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.478
dated.

327
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.146
Okay. well. cosmetic
touch ups are my thing.

328
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.606
We're only an hour
from downtown.

329
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.983
so that means the property
values here are set to take

330
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.111
off. He'll turn a sweet
profit.

331
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.112
Hey. Bo.

332
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.240
[gate creaks]

333
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.701
-What's he doing here?
-I'm so sorry. Abby.

334
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.244
I couldn't find the right time
to tell you this.

335
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.495
Tell me what?

336
00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.247
The house wasn't exactly left
to just John.

337
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.915
He's a co-beneficiary.

338
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.083
The other half of the house
was left

339
00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.419
to Frank's contractor. Bo.

340
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.920
And he doesn't want to sell.

341
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.714
He wants to turn into a bed
and breakfast.

342
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.717
What? He left it
to his handyman?

343
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.135
So it's not as simple--

344
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.096
I wanted to tell you last
night. but I chickened out.

345
00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.974
We're hoping that once you do
your flipping magic.

346
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.684
that Bo will see
how much money

347
00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.060
we can all get for the house.

348
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.896
And he'll be on board
to sell and split the money.

349
00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.399
-Claire!
-This for all of us. Abby.

350
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.026
But mostly. it's for Dad.

351
00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.405
Abigail. This is Bo.

352
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.950
Well. hello again.

353
00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:04.951
-Again?
-Wait?

354
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.245
You two know each other?

355
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.622
No. he just gave me the
runaround at the coffee shop.

356
00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.750
Okay. well. technically.
it was

357
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.961
you couldn't just relax and wait
a few minutes for a coffee.

358
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.296
I'm not here to relax.

359
00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.173
I'm here to flip this house
and help my family.

360
00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.927
Is that why you asked me here?

361
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.931
Look. I'm sorry that you made
the trip for nothing. okay?

362
00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.433
Maybe
come back after the holidays

363
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.686
and you can stay here
when it's a bed and breakfast.

364
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:32.979
Oh. no. that's okay.

365
00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.773
I prefer to stick around
and sell this place.

366
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:35.982
Bo. we know Frank loved you.

367
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.108
And we love you. too.

368
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.485
But we're stretched
to the max.

369
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.736
We need to sell this home

370
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.071
and give our family a house
we can live in.

371
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.489
You know. my dad's
living with us now.

372
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.698
I know. I know.

373
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.325
I totally get it.
But I also know

374
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.951
that this place would serve
the community best

375
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.495
as a B and B.

376
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.914
Is it an option to buy John
and Claire out of their half?

377
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.290
I can't swing it.

378
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.917
All my money's tied up keeping
my business afloat.

379
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.627
And we're living paycheck
to paycheck.

380
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.796
-Oh. boy.
-Look.

381
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.340
Frank lived here to 104
with my help. okay?

382
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.384
And I know that he would want
this place for people

383
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.387
visiting Granbury.
especially over the holidays.

384
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.889
I think he would have wanted
his immediate family

385
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.933
-to be comfortable.
-Okay.

386
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.351
We need to figure out
what we're going

387
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.853
to do with this house
and bickering

388
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.272
isn't
going to get us anywhere.

389
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.692
All right.

390
00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.151
So what do you suggest?

391
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.779
Maybe

392
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.739
we solve this the way
we solve things with our kids.

393
00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:25.865
-Excuse me?
-Your kids?

394
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.534
Whenever our kids
have a problem

395
00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.868
that they can't figure out.

396
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.203
we put them
in their room together

397
00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.914
so that they can focus
and work it out.

398
00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.499
I do not follow.

399
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.043
Look. whether this place gets
flipped or turned into a B and B

400
00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.920
the house is still going to need
some sprucing up. Agreed?

401
00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.213
-Yes. but--
-Agreed.

402
00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:42.549
So. with Abigail as our proxy.

403
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.384
the two of you can work
in the house

404
00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.636
getting it ready together
while coming to an agreement

405
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:47.887
and working out
your differences.

406
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.223
-Guys. I don't have time.
-Please.

407
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.434
Frank had the biggest heart
of anyone you ever met.

408
00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.936
I know he'd want us
to find a happy compromise.

409
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.313
Okay.

410
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.402
-Sure.
-Yes!

411
00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.279
[bright music]

412
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.448
Well. we should probably.

413
00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:11.661
Just leave you two to it.

414
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.122
Don't go.

415
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.925
Follow me.

416
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.802
Okay. so normally
this would be all decked out

417
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.304
for the holidays.
but Frank got sick--

418
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.597
Hold on.

419
00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.015
And I need condo floorplans

420
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.767
in the different unit
sizes. period.

421
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.685
Thanks. period.

422
00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.022
-Sorry. Work stuff.
-Ah.

423
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.441
There's so much space here.

424
00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.234
I'd love to extend
this vestibule

425
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.444
and create
a nice transition area

426
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.279
for when the new homeowner
walks in.

427
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.114
And I think
the guests at the B and B

428
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.742
would probably prefer it
to be an open space

429
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.077
like it is now.

430
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.787
you know. easier for them
to set their luggage down

431
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.996
and settle in.

432
00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:57.040
maybe a little table
with some treats or even

433
00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.500
a little check-in podium.

434
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.087
Oh. this isn't so bad.

435
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:07.634
I can just tear
the wallpaper off in here.

436
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:12.013
Oh. and in here.

437
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.099
And repaint the rooms

438
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.142
to revitalize
the entire space.

439
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.144
New buyers love that.

440
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.521
You know who else loves that?

441
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.439
People checking into a newly
renovated bed

442
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.691
and breakfast.

443
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:31.366
But I can repaint the trim here.
That would look good.

444
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.034
Okay. and for the stairs.

445
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.286
we can just rip up
these carpet

446
00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.331
thingies and
refinish the treads.

447
00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.875
Totally change the entire
entryway for the new buyer.

448
00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.502
Fresh. shiny. new staircase.

449
00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:43.795
Except for the fact that

450
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.505
the guests at the B and B
would probably prefer

451
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.007
the feeling of soft.

452
00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.384
warm carpet under their feet
as they mosey on up to bed.

453
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:53.513
Instead of. you know.
cold. hard wooden floors.

454
00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.556
Are you kidding me?

455
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.516
You've got a problem
with hardwood.

456
00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:57.976
Are you kidding?

457
00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.562
You have something
against carpeting.

458
00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.441
And this
guy's definitely got to go.

459
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.069
That is art.

460
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.077
So what now?

461
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.746
Well. we both agree

462
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.164
it could use a new paint job.
right?

463
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.374
-Sure. Agreed.
-Great.

464
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.876
I think a soft beige colour
might be nice.

465
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.753
I prefer red. it's more festive.

467
00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:28.715
Okay.

468
00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.508
You know.
this has been delightful.

469
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.218
I need to get back to my shop.
so why don't we just pick

470
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.553
this up in a few days?

471
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:34.721
A few days?

472
00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:38.350
-No. I'm on a very tight--

* Lean your ear this way*

476
00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.247
That's great. Jessica. Thanks.

477
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.291
Tell them if they can't get
the marble backsplash.

478
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.460
just go with the ceramic
tiles.

479
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.545
Less expensive
and it has the same effect.

480
00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.256
Yeah. great!

481
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.509
Oh. and one more thing.
Jessica.

482
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.637
I'm going to be
selling a house here soon. so

483
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.681
I need you to do a marketplace
analysis

484
00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.557
on the residential properties
in Brenbury.

485
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.685
Yep. okay. Eight
bedroom Victorian.

486
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.144
Consider it done.

487
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.813
Hey. it sounds
very festive there.

488
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:25.939
Where are you?

489
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.148
I don't know.

490
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.652
But if I see an elf
I'm coming home early.

491
00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:31.945
Got to go.

492
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.864
[Festive music plays on radio]

493
00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.661
I was just on the phone
with my assistant.

494
00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.246
Sorry.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.706

in a row for the flip.

496
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.044
Sorry. What was that?

497
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.171
I wasn't listening.

498
00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.298
Oh. okay.

499
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.426
I've got something
I want to show you.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.177
Oh. no. not. Not. not.
not. not there.

501
00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.554
Not there.

502
00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.562
Here.

503
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.987
Anyway.

504
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.405
I put this together so

505
00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.574
you can see the transformation
and see its potential.

506
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.700
Okay.

your mind.

pretty cool. huh?

Renovations are about hammers
and nails and blisters.

Now. let me show you
what I've been working on

517
00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.433
so you
can get an idea of my vision.

518
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.190
So this is where the sign is
going to go in the front lawn.

519
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:53.276
And then just the inside.

520
00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:56.905
It looks the same.

521
00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.073
It sure does.

522
00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.075
Except
now it's a bed and breakfast.

523
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.284
Are you familiar with the idea

524
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.660
of leaving well enough alone?

525
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.705
Listen. Bo. Imagine

526
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:09.584
a new young family is looking
for their forever home.

527
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.628
They walk
into a beautiful vestibule.

528
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.672
And as the kids race upstairs

529
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.382
to see what the bedrooms look
like.

530
00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.258

couple hug each other

found their forever home.

Okay. Nice.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.765

It's Christmas time.

and bring their children to

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.941
a quaint bed and breakfast.

538
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.776
The snow

539
00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.278
crunches under their feet
as they walk up the front steps.

540
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.447
They can feel the stress
melting away as they walk

541
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:43.118
into the open space
in the front lobby.

542
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.536
There's a fireplace
in the corner.

543
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.037
a beautiful Christmas tree
next to it.

544
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.123
and our friendly staff
bring them

545
00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.042
warm cups of eggnog
as they settle in

546
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:54.379
and join the rest of our
guests in festive activities.

547
00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.717
You are impossible.

548
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.219
Where are you going?

549
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:02.846
I've got errands
to run. deliveries to make.

550
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.348
Not all of us can sit around
all day and watch cartoons.

551
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.434
We haven't even talked about
paint colours.

552
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.770
I'll meet you at the hardware
store first thing tomorrow.

553
00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:11.813
Don't be late.

554
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.024
[bright music]

555
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:21.031
[Abigail] It's just not a very
welcoming shade.

556
00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:24.909
Red makes me think of a stop
sign or do not enter.

557
00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:26.661
Red makes me think of high
blood pressure.

558
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.329
Okay. you know what else red
is the color of?

559
00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:31.541
-Please don't say Santa--
-Santa Clause! Okay?

560
00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:35.003
Beige? Beige is so
dull and boring. beige

561
00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:38.381
is the color of a rock or dry
sand or oatmeal.

562
00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.258
Oh. beige
is the color of oatmeal.

563
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.802
Hey. oatmeal is very healthy.

564
00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.137
[phone vibrates]

565
00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.016
Here. give it here.

566
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:51.102
Oh. Abigail Jones?

567
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.481
You know.

568
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.859
believe it or not. I'm not
actually at my desk right now.

569
00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:00.904
If you send...

570
00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:04.491
Sorry. Yeah. I'm
just at a construction site.

571
00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:07.577
[jazz music]

572
00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:11.081
[people chattering]

573
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:15.627
Bo!

574
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:17.754
Hey. Ella! How's it going?

575
00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:18.505
Good.

576
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:21.174
Can I put in a request?

577
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:23.009
Sure. What do you got?

578
00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.641
Absolutely.

579
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.018
[Bo chuckles]

580
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.231
What was that all about?

581
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.316
Oh. that was just
a work thing.

582
00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:39.943
Hey. guys. Bo.

583
00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.027
You just missed Clarence.

584
00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:42.195
He was in here boasting

585
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:43.488
about all the work
you did to fix his shed.

586
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.447
No more raccoons?

587
00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:45.657
Not a creature stirring.

588
00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:47.742
-Not even a mouse. huh?
-Nope.

589
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:49.285
What can I get for you guys?

590
00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:51.037
Uh. coffee?

591
00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:52.247
Yes. please.

592
00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:54.916
You want oat
milk in it. city girl?

593
00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:55.959
Very funny.

594
00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:57.293
Two festive cinnamon
coffees. please.

595
00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:58.420
-Chloe.
-Oh. no. Sorry.

596
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.380
Just a regular black
coffee for me.

597
00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:01.840
Okay. no problem.

598
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.800
And you can put your money
away.

599
00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:04.926
It's the least that I can do
for you.

600
00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.594
Fixing the coffee
shop sign for me.

601
00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:09.931
Come on.
The sign was on the house or

602
00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.725
above the
house or something like that.

603
00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:13.101
I'm paying
and there's an argument.

604
00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:14.936
Okay?

605
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:16.730
I'll be over here.

606
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.482
He's something. isn't he?

607
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.484
He certainly is.

608
00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:24.404
Thanks for the coffee.

609
00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:26.614
You're welcome.

610
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.616
You were like Mr.
Popularity in there. huh?

611
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:29.534
Oh. what can I say?

612
00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:30.368
It's a community
full of people

613
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.120
with really great taste.

614
00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:33.496
Right.

615
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.457
So you're like a

616
00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.542
jack of all trades
kind of guy?

617
00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.544
Master of none.

618
00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.129
Yeah. I saw your
pencil drawings.

619
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:42.088
Ouch.

620
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.257
Well played.

621
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.633
What's that all about?

622
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:48.803
-What's what all about?
-That.

623
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.514
That's got to be like
75 acres of open land.

624
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.602
90. actually.

625
00:23:56.603 --> 00:23:57.979
It was left to the community
a few years ago

626
00:23:58.021 --> 00:24:00.148
by one of the residents.

627
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.566
Now it's up for sale.

628
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.651
which is too bad.

629
00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:05.320
hoping someone will just
leave it as is.

630
00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:09.324
Or we built a church or a
community centre for the kids.

631
00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:11.284
[phone vibrates]

632
00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:13.244
-Work.
-Of course.

633
00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.663
Hey. Jessica. how's it going?

634
00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:17.248
Good. I have those
numbers for you.

635
00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:19.751
Okay. so based on comparable
eight bedroom

636
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.711
Victorian listings
in the area.

637
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:23.004
it's even more than we thought.

638
00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:26.007
Wow. That's fantastic.

639
00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:27.175
[Abigail] Nice work.

640
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:28.885
Yeah. It's
a really quaint neighborhood.

641
00:24:28.927 --> 00:24:30.845
I think this flip will do
well.

642
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:32.681
There's even a massive piece
of land for sale

643
00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:33.848
that they might build
a community centre

644
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.684
on. which would also help
the market value.

645
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.310
Wow. That's
almost big enough for--

646
00:24:37.352 --> 00:24:39.187
[car horn honks]

647
00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:41.439
Sorry. Jessica.

648
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:42.691
I got to go.
but I'll call you later.

649
00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:48.071
[gentle music]

650
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:00.625
Hello?

651
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:01.835
Is this DevaCore?

652
00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:04.045
Yeah. I'd like to speak to
Antonio. please.

653
00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:06.715
This is Abigail
Jones's office calling.

654
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.136
[bright music]

655
00:25:13.304 --> 00:25:14.431
Okay.

656
00:25:14.472 --> 00:25:15.974
This shouldn't be too hard.

657
00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:16.850
Yeah.

658
00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:18.977
[dramatic festive music]

659
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:27.777
[wallpaper tearing]

660
00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:46.379
FYI.

661
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:47.464
I do this for a living.

662
00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:49.632
so you might want to watch
and learn.

663
00:25:49.674 --> 00:25:51.676
There's a specific technique
to using a roller.

664
00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:54.346
You can't just be all willy
nilly with your strokes.

665
00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:56.890
-There's a method to it.
-I see.

666
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:58.308
May I?

667
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.643
-Sure.
-Great.

668
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:01.603
Thank you.

669
00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:04.022
So you mean something like.

670
00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:05.565
I don't know.

671
00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:07.025
This?

672
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.652
What?

673
00:26:09.694 --> 00:26:11.279
I can't believe you just did
that.

674
00:26:11.321 --> 00:26:14.741
It looks good. Wow.

675
00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:17.994
Okay. well.
better on me. than

676
00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:19.162
on the wall.

677
00:26:21.581 --> 00:26:22.665
What are you doing?

678
00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:25.377
What? Nothing.

679
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:26.628
Don't even think about it.

680
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.004
-What?
-We're even now.

681
00:26:28.046 --> 00:26:29.673
-It's over.
-Even? We're not even.

682
00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:32.050
We have a lot of work to do.

683
00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:37.722
Okay. that's it.

684
00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:39.849
You're toast.

685
00:26:40.892 --> 00:26:42.394
-I am toast. you know why?
-Why?

686
00:26:42.727 --> 00:26:46.690
Because beige
is the color of dry toast.

687
00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:48.483
[dramatic festive
music continues]

688
00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:54.823
[Bo] Okay. okay. Truce. truce.

689
00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:56.866
[Abigail] Oh. truce. sure.

690
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.202
[Bo] Come on. we had a truce!

691
00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:01.079
[Abigail] Get back here!

692
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:10.213
You should fix that.

693
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.926
Excuse me. sir.

694
00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:16.803
I was hoping
I could talk to you about

695
00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:18.680
taking a couple of days off
over Christmas.

696
00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:19.848
Blair. what do you think
about DevaCore

697
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:23.226
expanding
outside of the downtown core?

698
00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:26.396
Oh. well.
that is pretty risky. sir.

699
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:28.690
We've established such a great
track record here.

700
00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:30.150
We'd be better off
sticking with what

701
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:32.736
we know rather
than taking any chances.

702
00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:33.903
Now about Christmas?

703
00:27:33.945 --> 00:27:35.572
What about Brenbury?

704
00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:37.907
[curious music]

705
00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:40.827
Who-bury?

706
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:44.414
We should probably rethink
this.

707
00:27:44.456 --> 00:27:45.749
Yeah.

708
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.418
It's less festive.
more circus.

709
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.086
Maybe we should. uh.

710
00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:53.256
I don't know.
get lunch and try again later.

711
00:27:53.298 --> 00:27:56.051
You mean together
or do you mean you go

712
00:27:56.092 --> 00:27:59.804
get lunch and I go get lunch
and then we meet back later?

713
00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:01.264
Well. I mean.
we both have to eat. right?

714
00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:04.768
So I just thought maybe we'd
get lunch together. but

715
00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.269
I did. whatever you think.

716
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:08.813
Doesn't matter to me.

717
00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:11.649
No. Yeah. that.

718
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:13.443
That would be good.

719
00:28:13.485 --> 00:28:15.278
I'm just going to.

720
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.739
I just need to run home and
change into something

721
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:19.407
a little less splattered.

722
00:28:19.449 --> 00:28:20.742
Right. Yeah.

723
00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:23.244
You know. it's a shame.

724
00:28:23.286 --> 00:28:25.705
if you want to meet outside.
Java Dreams in an hour.

725
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:28.291
I know a place near there
where we could go?

726
00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:30.460
-Great.
-Great.

727
00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:36.341
[bright music]

728
00:28:44.224 --> 00:28:47.060
[Claire humming]

729
00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:49.979
The Nightmare
Before Christmas.

730
00:28:50.021 --> 00:28:51.481
What happened to you?

731
00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:53.358
You should see the other guy.

732
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.568
Things got a little out of
hand at the house.

733
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.112
I'll say.

734
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:59.489
You look like you got into a
painful fight with Santa's elves

735
00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:01.241
and lost. [chuckles]

736
00:29:03.201 --> 00:29:04.536
What's happening out here?

737
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:05.912
Well. he's
trying to figure out

738
00:29:05.954 --> 00:29:08.832
which bulb is causing
the whole thing not to work.

739
00:29:08.873 --> 00:29:10.667
I think he's just lost
without Mom

740
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:12.335
and his career.

741
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:13.878
[soft music]

742
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:16.339
Yeah.

743
00:29:17.382 --> 00:29:18.258
I get that.

744
00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:23.138
Okay.

745
00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:25.515
I'm going to shower quick and
then go grab a bite with Bo.

746
00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:28.184
Well. you'll have to wait
because John's in the shower.

747
00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:29.561
Oh. okay.

748
00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:31.229
Because we only have one
bathroom.

749
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:32.397
Right.

750
00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:33.273
[Claire] Because our house
is too small.

751
00:29:33.523 --> 00:29:34.733
Got it.

752
00:29:34.774 --> 00:29:38.028
So small that Dad has to live
in the garage.

753
00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:40.196
And I'm sleeping on the couch.

754
00:29:40.238 --> 00:29:44.075
I got it. I promise I'll
flip this property ASAP.

755
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:46.619
Can I help you with all this?

756
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:48.913
Yes. please.

757
00:29:50.957 --> 00:29:52.375
-What?
-Nothing.

758
00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:54.627
Just this kind of mess
would drive me crazy.

759
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:56.463
Oh. I know.

760
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:59.049
You were the kid who had to
have everything neat and tidy.

761
00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.258
Just a certain way.

762
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.593
Just like Dad.

763
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:04.429
I always admired his
efficiency and organization.

764
00:30:06.097 --> 00:30:07.766
I remember Christmas mornings.

765
00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:08.892
Mom would sit in her

766
00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:12.145
chair. smiling ear to ear.
watching you

767
00:30:12.187 --> 00:30:15.148
because you insisted on
being the one to

768
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.733
hand out the gifts
from under the tree.

769
00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:18.401
And nobody was allowed
to start opening

770
00:30:18.443 --> 00:30:20.278
until we all had
our own little piles.

771
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.239
And then everybody went one
at a time. one by one.

772
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:25.575
The whole thing took forever.

773
00:30:25.617 --> 00:30:27.035
I like things
to be organized.

774
00:30:27.077 --> 00:30:29.245
And I like to see
what other people get.

775
00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:30.413
Why. how do you guys do
it?

776
00:30:30.455 --> 00:30:33.416
-Six minutes. Start to finish.
-What? No.

777
00:30:33.458 --> 00:30:35.418
Our record is
actually four minutes.

778
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.004
It was like a wrapping paper
tsunami.

779
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:39.756
You. Mom and Dad
used to come over post

780
00:30:39.798 --> 00:30:41.675
frenzy and miss the chaos.

781
00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:45.220
I think you and Dad are
in for a shocker this year.

782
00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.097
You were just as
bad as me when we were kids.

783
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.433
Okay. maybe not as bad. but
you were a control freak. too.

784
00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:52.560
Well. I think we came by it.
honestly.

785
00:30:52.602 --> 00:30:55.355
Mom and Dad were all about
keeping order in their house.

786
00:30:55.397 --> 00:30:58.400
Wait. So then how did you break
that habit?

787
00:30:58.441 --> 00:31:00.944
You seem totally fine
with all this chaos.

788
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:03.113
Well.
early in our relationship.

789
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:05.407
John picked me up for a date
wearing a t-shirt

790
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:06.533
that said. "Relax.

791
00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:08.243
Nothing is under control."

792
00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:10.203
I thought it was funny
at first. but

793
00:31:10.245 --> 00:31:12.414
it started
this whole talk about

794
00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:15.458
letting go and just working
with what life throws at you.

795
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.211
That's John's
philosophy. and it's

796
00:31:18.253 --> 00:31:20.463
one of the reasons
why I fell in love with him.

797
00:31:20.505 --> 00:31:22.924
And once
I wrapped my mind around it.

798
00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:24.718
the stress just melted away.

799
00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:27.512
Everything
felt easier and happier.

800
00:31:28.513 --> 00:31:29.514
And that's how I

801
00:31:29.556 --> 00:31:31.641
quit the whole control
freak thing.

802
00:31:31.683 --> 00:31:33.518
That's amazing.

803
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.561
No. no. no. no. no. no.

804
00:31:34.602 --> 00:31:36.021
I'm sorry.

805
00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:38.106
The shark goes with the sea
creatures in the blue bin.

806
00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:39.816
So it goes
birds in the purple.

807
00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:41.985
mammals in the pink. reptiles.
obviously in the green.

808
00:31:42.027 --> 00:31:44.696
And then the sea creatures
in the blue.

809
00:31:47.032 --> 00:31:49.659
I'm a work in progress.

810
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:52.370
[both laughing]

811
00:31:57.292 --> 00:31:58.793
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

812
00:31:59.794 --> 00:32:02.005
You really meant it
when you said grab lunch. huh?

813
00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:04.090
You're not a fan of the ho
ho hotdog?

814
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:06.676
-No.
-Oh.

815
00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:08.136
Never had

816
00:32:08.178 --> 00:32:10.180
cranberry sauce
on a hot dog before.

817
00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:12.682
'Tis the season. remember?

818
00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:13.850
I also had something

819
00:32:13.892 --> 00:32:15.852
a little more seated
and heated in mind.

820
00:32:15.894 --> 00:32:16.895
Right.

821
00:32:16.936 --> 00:32:18.855
Well.
the owner of the food truck.

822
00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:19.898
Had some medical issues.

823
00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.649
So he could
really use the business.

824
00:32:21.691 --> 00:32:23.234
[Abigail] Oh.

825
00:32:24.694 --> 00:32:26.613
Speaking of business. can
you hold this for a second?

826
00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:27.822
Yeah.

827
00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:32.702
Text Jessica.

828
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:35.205
Hey. Jess how are the DevaCore
pre-sale meetings going?

829
00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:36.414
Question mark.

830
00:32:36.456 --> 00:32:38.583
Let's make sure
they're afternoon meetings

831
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.628
delete. delete. delete.
morning meetings.

832
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.630
Period. Thanks. Period.

833
00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:45.548
I think you might
have gotten an exclamation

834
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.384
mark in there
somewhere. period.

835
00:32:49.052 --> 00:32:50.387
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

836
00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:52.764
I can't believe that land

837
00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:54.933
is just sat empty.

838
00:32:54.974 --> 00:32:57.018
There's so many things that
could have filled that space.

839
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.269
Yeah. but why?

840
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.312
I mean. what's
wrong with the way it is now?

841
00:32:59.354 --> 00:33:01.648
It's peaceful.
serene. stress free.

842
00:33:02.232 --> 00:33:03.358
You know. not everything
in life is about bigger.

843
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.318
better. faster. wealthier.

844
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.278
But it is about progress.

845
00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:09.447
That's how you get to the top.

846
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:11.199
My dad always says. "You don't
stop when you're tired.

847
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.951
You stop when you're done."

848
00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:14.661
Kind of a
tradition that stuck with me.

849
00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:18.832
Hey. speaking of tradition.

850
00:33:20.166 --> 00:33:21.376
there's something
I could use an

851
00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:22.752
extra pair of hands
with if you're up for it.

852
00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:24.546
It won't take long.

853
00:33:24.587 --> 00:33:26.673
-Now?
-Please?

854
00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:29.926
All right.

855
00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:30.844
What's the harm?

856
00:33:30.885 --> 00:33:33.888
-Yeah.
-[gentle music]

857
00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:52.115
Christmas tree park.

858
00:33:52.323 --> 00:33:53.867
Close. Christmas tree farm.

859
00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:56.369
Frank and I would come here
every holiday season.

860
00:33:56.411 --> 00:33:58.329
We'd get two trees.
one for his place

861
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.665
and the other to donate to a
local Christmas charity drive.

862
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:03.668
Christmas is all
about traditions.

863
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.045
Where do you get your tree
from?

864
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.796
From the box
in my storage room.

865
00:34:06.838 --> 00:34:08.840
What? No. seriously?

866
00:34:08.882 --> 00:34:10.717
-A fake tree?
-Yeah.

867
00:34:10.759 --> 00:34:14.220
It's esthetically perfect.
and I can control the design--

868
00:34:14.262 --> 00:34:16.097
But you don't get the smell of
an evergreen

869
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.223
on Christmas morning.

870
00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:18.308
Oh. yes. I do.

871
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.060
-There's a spray for that.
-A spray?

872
00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:22.187
What? It lets me control
the ambiance.

873
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:25.106
The ambiance? Yeah. right.

874
00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:26.691
This is beautiful.

875
00:34:26.733 --> 00:34:28.234
Yeah.

876
00:34:28.276 --> 00:34:29.694
It's a remembrance tree.

877
00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:31.363
And the idea is that
people will donate

878
00:34:31.404 --> 00:34:33.365
to the Brenbury
Christmas Charity Fund.

879
00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:34.783
They'll take an
ornament. they'll

880
00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:37.452
write the name of a loved one
that they've lost and

881
00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:39.704
hang it up to honour
their memory.

882
00:34:39.746 --> 00:34:40.955
I love that.

883
00:34:42.332 --> 00:34:44.751
It was planted
almost twenty years ago.

884
00:34:45.877 --> 00:34:47.379
By Frank.

885
00:34:47.587 --> 00:34:49.923
[soft music]

886
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.512
You made all these?

887
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.056
Yeah.

888
00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:01.059
Well. I mean. the community
makes the memories.

889
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.727
I just make the ornaments.

890
00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:24.332
All right. let's go

891
00:35:24.374 --> 00:35:26.334
cut down
a Christmas tree. huh?

892
00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:27.961
-What?
-Now remember.

893
00:35:28.169 --> 00:35:29.921
Don't stop when you're tired.

894
00:35:29.963 --> 00:35:32.007
Stop when you're done.

895
00:35:32.048 --> 00:35:33.466
Very funny.

896
00:35:33.967 --> 00:35:35.927
But you're going to do

897
00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:37.804
the actual cutting. right?

898
00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:39.764
Okay.
so the key to a good Christmas

899
00:35:39.806 --> 00:35:41.599
tree is the height to density
ratio.

900
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:43.601
Oh. Are you a tinsel person?

901
00:35:43.643 --> 00:35:44.686
Tinsel?

902
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:47.564
No. tinsel
is way too messy for me.

903
00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:50.734
Oh. you smell that?

904
00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:52.694
I love that smell.

905
00:35:52.736 --> 00:35:53.945
You know.
this farm has been here

906
00:35:53.987 --> 00:35:55.947
for almost 200 years.

907
00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.282
Oh. hey.

908
00:35:57.323 --> 00:35:58.825
You see that wooded area
over there?

909
00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:00.660
That is part of the vacant
lot for sale.

910
00:36:00.702 --> 00:36:04.122
It's a habitat
for deer. foxes. rabbits.

911
00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.290
Very cool.

912
00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:07.542
-It's so close to the city.
-Yeah.

913
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:08.960
Schools will hold
outdoor classes there.

914
00:36:09.002 --> 00:36:10.879
They'll try to teach kids
to appreciate nature.

915
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.964
You know. maybe ween them off
their obsession

916
00:36:13.006 --> 00:36:14.549
with cell phones.

917
00:36:15.842 --> 00:36:17.385
-[phone chimes]
-[phone vibrates]

918
00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:19.387
I'll just

919
00:36:19.429 --> 00:36:20.805
get that later.

920
00:36:20.847 --> 00:36:21.639
Yeah.

921
00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:24.476
Oh. hey. that one's perfect.

922
00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:26.853
Oh. yeah. Yeah.

923
00:36:26.895 --> 00:36:28.855
This one is perfect.

924
00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:30.982
I mean.
I don't know about perfect.

925
00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:33.443
It looks a little crooked.
and there's a big hole

926
00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:34.569
where the branches
are supposed to be.

927
00:36:34.611 --> 00:36:35.945
Oh. come on.
It's only uneven

928
00:36:35.987 --> 00:36:38.031
because some of the
branches are covered in snow.

929
00:36:38.948 --> 00:36:40.033
Speaking of which.

930
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.621
-[upbeat music]
-Don't you even think about it?

931
00:36:44.662 --> 00:36:45.830
-Don't you dare!
-[Bo] This is also

932
00:36:45.872 --> 00:36:46.873
part of the tradition.

933
00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:51.544
[both laughing]

934
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:53.838
Game on!

935
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:59.511
[upbeat music continues]

936
00:37:02.555 --> 00:37:04.432
You're going to have to do
better than that.

937
00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:07.894
You missed!

938
00:37:15.193 --> 00:37:19.531
[upbeat music continues]

939
00:37:24.077 --> 00:37:26.037
[Bo] Hey. you're not getting
away that easy!

940
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.539
[Abigail] Think I might!

941
00:37:34.129 --> 00:37:36.673
You're quite the outdoorsman.

942
00:37:36.715 --> 00:37:37.924
My mother was a lumberjack.

943
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.178
-Really?
-No. She was a lumber-jill.

944
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.765
[both laughing]

945
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:50.729
My mom would have loved it
here.

946
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.898
Oh. you should
bring her next year.

947
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.192
That might be tricky.

948
00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:58.153
She passed away.

949
00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:02.741
I'm so sorry.

950
00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:06.077
First Christmas without her.

951
00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:07.162
She just got really sick.

952
00:38:07.203 --> 00:38:10.540
And then...

953
00:38:10.582 --> 00:38:12.167
It's been really hard
without her.

954
00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:14.961
[soft music]

955
00:38:15.628 --> 00:38:17.714
Hey. you know. the cool thing
about cutting down a tree?

956
00:38:18.965 --> 00:38:20.800
Is that you get to take away
the part that's above ground

957
00:38:20.842 --> 00:38:22.969
that you've
been looking at for years.

958
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:25.930
But the roots still remain.

959
00:38:25.972 --> 00:38:29.309
All the memories
and the DNA of the tree

960
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:32.145
become a part of the earth
so it never really goes away.

961
00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:36.733
I think this might be
our tree.

962
00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:40.528
Right. Our tree.

963
00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:48.620
Okay. I've never actually cut
down a tree before. so

964
00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:50.038
I wouldn't know
where to start.

965
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.664
The trunk.

966
00:38:53.124 --> 00:38:54.626
Seems right.

967
00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.172
Okay. So just...

968
00:38:59.422 --> 00:39:01.675
[gentle music]

969
00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:07.639
Here. here.

970
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:09.557
Easy. You're not fighting
the tree. okay?

971
00:39:09.808 --> 00:39:12.018
You just keep it flat

972
00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:14.521
and straight.

973
00:39:14.562 --> 00:39:16.481
back and forth.

974
00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:17.982
Slowly but surely.

975
00:39:18.024 --> 00:39:20.151
the tree will start to tip
over.

976
00:39:20.193 --> 00:39:22.112
It gets easier and easier. okay?

977
00:39:27.534 --> 00:39:28.702
Yeah. and then. uh.

978
00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:31.287
Maybe we'll just take turns.

979
00:39:32.205 --> 00:39:34.040
Sure.

980
00:39:34.082 --> 00:39:35.667
-You go first.
-Okay.

981
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.630
[Abigail laughing]
Don't hit the sides.

982
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:44.300
-You got it?
-I got it.

983
00:39:44.634 --> 00:39:45.802
-Don't worry.
-I'm going to return the saw.

984
00:39:45.844 --> 00:39:47.178
and then I'll meet you
back at the truck?

985
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.555
Okay.

986
00:39:50.056 --> 00:39:53.268
[gentle music continues]

987
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:26.051
[gentle music continues]

988
00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:52.827
[people laughing]

989
00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:54.120
[Abigail] Technically.
I got it down.

990
00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:56.247
[Bo] Okay technically.
it was already leaning.

991
00:40:56.289 --> 00:40:57.874
And you just got. like.
the last little--

992
00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:58.792
That's all that matters.
Secondly.

993
00:40:58.833 --> 00:41:00.418
I'm the one who
got it down.

994
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.629
Where have you two been?

995
00:41:02.671 --> 00:41:04.464
We went to a Christmas tree
park.

996
00:41:04.506 --> 00:41:06.841
-Farm.
-Farm. Christmas tree farm.

997
00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:08.051
and a snowball fight broke out.

998
00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:10.428
-Which she started.
-I did not!

999
00:41:10.804 --> 00:41:12.847
You made the first snowball
and also made that look.

1000
00:41:12.889 --> 00:41:15.558
-What look?
-This look.

1001
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.935
-That look?
-Mm-hmm.

1002
00:41:16.976 --> 00:41:18.645
I do not make that look. And you
threw the first one.

1003
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:21.189
Self-defence!
Totally self-defence.

1004
00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:23.775
-I almost lost an eye.
-He's kidding.

1005
00:41:24.192 --> 00:41:25.944
I took off
and then he chased me.

1006
00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:28.154
-And then I caught her.
-I slowed down for you.

1007
00:41:28.613 --> 00:41:30.990
Anyway. we found this huge
Christmas tree.

1008
00:41:31.032 --> 00:41:32.492
It's only about eight feet tall.
it's not that huge.

1009
00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:33.785
And I cut it down.

1010
00:41:33.827 --> 00:41:35.787
-Well. we...
-Okay. we.

1011
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:37.455
-We cut it down.
-Thank you.

1012
00:41:37.914 --> 00:41:39.958
And then we lugged it
three miles all the way

1013
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.002
-to Bo's truck.
-It wasn't three miles.

1014
00:41:42.043 --> 00:41:44.713
It was three miles.
It was a long time.

1015
00:41:44.754 --> 00:41:45.922
-And I carried it.
-Did you?

1016
00:41:45.964 --> 00:41:47.007
-All by myself.
-Really?

1017
00:41:47.048 --> 00:41:48.216
-No help.
-That's how you remember it?

1018
00:41:48.508 --> 00:41:49.801
Yeah. [laughs]

1019
00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:53.805
Wow. That was
quite the adventure.

1020
00:41:55.223 --> 00:41:56.891
Yeah.

1021
00:41:57.517 --> 00:41:58.601
So where's. uh.

1022
00:41:58.643 --> 00:41:59.811
Where's John?

1023
00:41:59.853 --> 00:42:01.521
He's watching the game
in the living room.

1024
00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:04.024
Maybe I'll pop in and say a
quick hello before I take off.

1025
00:42:04.065 --> 00:42:05.525
Oh. really?

1026
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:08.361
I mean. I mean. yeah.
we should.

1027
00:42:08.403 --> 00:42:09.529
Yeah.

1028
00:42:09.571 --> 00:42:10.363
I'll see you in the morning.

1029
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:11.448
In the morning?

1030
00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:12.824
-In the morning. Yeah.
-First thing.

1031
00:42:12.866 --> 00:42:14.200
We still have
a lot of work to do.

1032
00:42:14.242 --> 00:42:15.577
We sure do.

1033
00:42:15.618 --> 00:42:19.247
So I will see you
in the morning.

1034
00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:20.874
See you tomorrow.

1035
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:24.461
[gentle music]

1036
00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:25.920
Is there something

1037
00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:28.089
brewing between you and Bo?

1038
00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:30.050
What? Brewing?

1039
00:42:30.091 --> 00:42:32.385
No. no. I don't have time for

1040
00:42:32.427 --> 00:42:34.679
that kind of distraction.

1041
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:37.640
Things with work are going too.

1042
00:42:37.682 --> 00:42:40.060
going too well to.

1043
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:41.853
you know.

1044
00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:45.190
-Yeah. totally not distracted.
-[phone vibrates]

1045
00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:46.524
Oh. shoot.

1046
00:42:46.566 --> 00:42:49.027
I forgot this was on vibrate.

1047
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:51.404
Okay. I need to
take this somewhere private.

1048
00:42:54.532 --> 00:42:55.450
[door slams]

1049
00:42:55.492 --> 00:42:56.785
Hey. Antonio.

1050
00:42:56.826 --> 00:42:59.579
Sorry. I'm just working
on some closet designs.

1051
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:03.166
I've been trying to get a hold
of you for a few hours now.

1052
00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:05.502
So tell me about this
parcel land for sale.

1053
00:43:06.336 --> 00:43:07.420
Excuse me? What parcel?

1054
00:43:07.754 --> 00:43:10.090
What parcel?

1055
00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:11.925
I got a call from your assistant
today telling me that

1056
00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:14.761
there's a huge piece of land
for sale in Brenbury.

1057
00:43:14.803 --> 00:43:16.304
Oh. that.

1058
00:43:16.346 --> 00:43:19.641
That was just something
I mentioned in passing.

1059
00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:21.101
You know. I think
expanding outside

1060
00:43:21.142 --> 00:43:23.061
the city core is the way to go.

1061
00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:24.979
Really? No.

1062
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:26.189
I think Brenbury is too

1063
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:28.525
small potatoes for a company
like DevaCore.

1064
00:43:28.566 --> 00:43:30.068
You should really just
focus on--

1065
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.611
[Antonio] I just closed a deal
with a coffee chain.

1066
00:43:31.653 --> 00:43:33.988
I think putting one of those
coffee shops in a new condo

1067
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.741
development
outside the downtown core

1068
00:43:36.783 --> 00:43:38.243
would show growth potential.

1069
00:43:38.284 --> 00:43:40.453
Well.
unfortunately. Brenbury

1070
00:43:40.495 --> 00:43:43.123
already has a coffee shop
and this little community

1071
00:43:43.164 --> 00:43:45.583
is really not big
enough for two coffee shops.

1072
00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:48.253
Exactly.

1073
00:43:48.294 --> 00:43:49.754
It's an upgrade.

1074
00:43:49.796 --> 00:43:51.297
This is a huge opportunity.

1075
00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:53.466
We can start there
and expand our way

1076
00:43:53.508 --> 00:43:54.843
through the rest of Brenbury.

1077
00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:56.928
Just think about your sales
opportunities

1078
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.973
if we gentrify
an entire municipality.

1079
00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:02.225
Gentrify? Antonio.

1080
00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:05.353
that is that is a lot of
uprooting.

1081
00:44:05.562 --> 00:44:07.230
[Antonio] Like you said

1082
00:44:07.272 --> 00:44:09.441
got a break
a few eggs to make an omelet.

1083
00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:13.361
Wait. Hello? Hello?

1084
00:44:14.195 --> 00:44:16.531
[soft music]

1085
00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:28.251
[Claire humming]

1086
00:44:28.293 --> 00:44:30.170
[John] Yeah. we were
hoping for a better season.

1087
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:31.796
You know.

1088
00:44:31.838 --> 00:44:32.839
that's the way it goes.

1089
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:35.216
Yeah. yeah. I know
what you mean.

1090
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:39.137
[Jessica] I am so sorry.

1091
00:44:39.179 --> 00:44:41.014
I had no idea that this wasn't
something that you wanted

1092
00:44:41.056 --> 00:44:42.515
and that it would
cause problems.

1093
00:44:42.557 --> 00:44:43.600
Hang on a second. Jess.

1094
00:44:43.641 --> 00:44:44.934
-Thanks. Chloe.
-No problem. Hey.

1095
00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:45.977
If you're free tonight.

1096
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:47.354
I'm having a girls night
at my place.

1097
00:44:47.395 --> 00:44:49.814
Sugar cookies. eggnog.
Christmas movies.

1098
00:44:49.856 --> 00:44:51.358
It'll be fun! Want to come?

1099
00:44:51.399 --> 00:44:54.194
That sounds so fun.
but unfortunately.

1100
00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:56.529
things are a little hectic
at work right now. so I can't.

1101
00:44:56.571 --> 00:44:58.698
-But thank you.
-No worries.

1102
00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.866
Next time.

1103
00:44:59.908 --> 00:45:02.452
Yes. I know
your intentions were good.

1104
00:45:02.494 --> 00:45:04.537
but you got to check with me
first on these things.

1105
00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:05.955
Okay?

1106
00:45:05.997 --> 00:45:08.291
I'm sure Antonio is just
spitballing this whole thing.

1107
00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:10.377
Let's not panic.

1108
00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:11.920
[Blair] Hello!

1109
00:45:12.962 --> 00:45:13.922
I'm gonna
have to call you back.

1110
00:45:13.963 --> 00:45:16.508
Wait! But I-- [sighs]

1111
00:45:18.134 --> 00:45:20.136
Hey. Blair. what a surprise.

1112
00:45:20.178 --> 00:45:21.930
You know. I got a bit
of a bone to pick with you.

1113
00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:23.223
-Oh?
-I knew from everyone

1114
00:45:23.264 --> 00:45:24.599
raving about you
that you'd be good.

1115
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:27.394
But apparently you're too
good.

1116
00:45:27.435 --> 00:45:28.436
You lost me.

1117
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:30.563
Antonio is so keen
on this gold mine

1118
00:45:30.605 --> 00:45:31.815
you found that

1119
00:45:31.856 --> 00:45:34.067
my Puerto Vallarta plans
might be going Adios.

1120
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:36.903
Oh. I don't know if I would
call Brenbury a gold mine.

1121
00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:38.196
But I suppose

1122
00:45:38.238 --> 00:45:40.907
bring you in does
make me look like a superstar.

1123
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:42.909
Anyway. I'm
doing a valuation of the area

1124
00:45:42.951 --> 00:45:45.578
so Antonio can make
an official offer.

1125
00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:49.040
Wow. that was quick.

1126
00:45:49.082 --> 00:45:51.710
Isn't it something
to mull over first?

1127
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:53.003
Antonio is not a muller.

1128
00:45:53.044 --> 00:45:54.170
He's a pouncer.

1129
00:45:54.212 --> 00:45:56.589
That's why
he loves the holiday season.

1130
00:45:56.631 --> 00:45:57.757
I don't follow.

1131
00:45:57.799 --> 00:45:59.926
He knows that
everybody is distracted

1132
00:45:59.968 --> 00:46:01.970
by all this sensitive. gushy
Christmas stuff

1133
00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:03.263
and their guard is down.

1134
00:46:03.304 --> 00:46:06.474
That's when he swoops in
and grabs deals.

1135
00:46:06.516 --> 00:46:07.809
That's strategic.

1136
00:46:07.851 --> 00:46:09.686
Yeah. Yeah.

1137
00:46:09.728 --> 00:46:11.271
This place any good?

1138
00:46:11.312 --> 00:46:13.189
-Yeah. it's actually really--
-Great. Hey!

1139
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:14.607
I'm going to get a decaf
peppermint mocha.

1140
00:46:14.649 --> 00:46:17.235
Half sweet. no whip.
no foam. extra hot. Pick me up.

1141
00:46:18.028 --> 00:46:20.447
And congrats.
We're going to be rich.

1142
00:46:20.822 --> 00:46:23.616
[soft music]

1143
00:46:38.673 --> 00:46:41.259
-Hey.
-Hey.

1144
00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:45.096
You okay?
You seem a little distracted.

1145
00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:47.599
No. I'm fine.
I'm just tired.

1146
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.517
Thanks.

1147
00:46:51.561 --> 00:46:55.148
Sorry. I almost forgot.

1148
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:59.486
Yeah. about that. I should.
I should explain.

1149
00:47:00.528 --> 00:47:03.490
It kind of has

1150
00:47:03.531 --> 00:47:05.033
sentimental value.

1151
00:47:06.368 --> 00:47:08.912
So I was actually married
when I was younger.

1152
00:47:08.953 --> 00:47:10.330
Too young. really.

1153
00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:12.082
Oh. so this was her chair?

1154
00:47:12.123 --> 00:47:14.334
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1155
00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:15.710
Not that.

1156
00:47:16.795 --> 00:47:18.797
I was.

1157
00:47:18.838 --> 00:47:20.548
I was really crushed
when she left.

1158
00:47:21.466 --> 00:47:24.177
And I guess
it kind of triggered

1159
00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:26.971
this whole abandonment thing
because my dad left

1160
00:47:27.013 --> 00:47:28.014
when I was a little kid
and I didn't

1161
00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:29.140
have anyone to turn to.

1162
00:47:29.182 --> 00:47:31.768
And I kind of fell
into this dark stage

1163
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:32.769
in my life.

1164
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:35.689
[soft music]

1165
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.025
-So no Christmas music?
-No.

1166
00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:41.528
No Christmas music.

1167
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:47.784
It was actually Frank
who pulled me out of it.

1168
00:47:49.327 --> 00:47:51.538
Frank?

1169
00:47:51.579 --> 00:47:53.206
Yeah.

1170
00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:57.252
He kind of became the father
I never had.

1171
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.966
Took me under his wing and

1172
00:48:03.008 --> 00:48:04.843
helped me understand
why sometimes bad things

1173
00:48:04.884 --> 00:48:06.720
happen to good people.

1174
00:48:08.888 --> 00:48:11.057
And as I got older.
he encouraged me

1175
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:13.560
to follow my passion
for woodworking.

1176
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:15.562
even cosigned the loan
that helped me open this place

1177
00:48:15.603 --> 00:48:18.106
so I could help people
in the community.

1178
00:48:19.357 --> 00:48:21.526
After my marriage
fell apart he

1179
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.237
was right there to pick up
the pieces.

1180
00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:27.949
I made these two chairs

1181
00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:31.411
for us. and every morning
we would sit in his porch

1182
00:48:31.453 --> 00:48:33.580
we'd sip our coffees
and we talk about life

1183
00:48:33.621 --> 00:48:35.957
and just

1184
00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:38.168
wave at passers by.

1185
00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:41.171
[soft music continues]

1186
00:48:42.464 --> 00:48:44.257
It' s where he helped me
figure my life out.

1187
00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:50.138
Silly. right?
They're just chairs.

1188
00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:53.641
No. I think it's beautiful.

1189
00:48:57.979 --> 00:49:00.023
Frank. used to have this quote.

1190
00:49:00.065 --> 00:49:01.608
it would help me see things
more positively.

1191
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:04.319
He'd say.

1192
00:49:06.404 --> 00:49:08.448
"Don't cry because it's over.

1193
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.867
Smile because it happened."

1194
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:13.787
That's really nice.

1195
00:49:13.828 --> 00:49:14.954
Who wrote that?

1196
00:49:14.996 --> 00:49:16.331
Walt Whitman?

1197
00:49:16.373 --> 00:49:17.791
It's Dr. Seuss. actually.

1198
00:49:17.832 --> 00:49:22.170
Dr. Seuss? Really? Huh.

1199
00:49:23.505 --> 00:49:25.799
Anyway.
we should get back to work.

1200
00:49:26.424 --> 00:49:27.801
Yeah.

1201
00:49:27.842 --> 00:49:29.511
Let me show you this.

1202
00:49:29.552 --> 00:49:31.846
[bright music]

1203
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.556
Oh. boy.

1204
00:49:33.598 --> 00:49:34.808
Another cartoon. maybe we should
go make some popcorn.

1205
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:36.726
Oh. very funny.

1206
00:49:36.768 --> 00:49:38.520
Just look.

1207
00:49:46.736 --> 00:49:49.489
[soft music]

1208
00:49:49.989 --> 00:49:51.991
Hey. Dad.

1209
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.201
you got a second?

1210
00:49:53.243 --> 00:49:54.703
Sure.

1211
00:49:54.744 --> 00:49:56.496
I got a lot of them.

1212
00:49:58.164 --> 00:50:00.375
Make yourself useful.

1213
00:50:03.294 --> 00:50:08.299
I'm trying to figure out
this work-life situation.

1214
00:50:08.341 --> 00:50:11.886
and I'm kind of stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

1215
00:50:11.928 --> 00:50:13.722
That's no fun.

1216
00:50:13.763 --> 00:50:15.515
Everything feels

1217
00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:18.685
complicated and conflicting.

1218
00:50:18.727 --> 00:50:21.855
Like I know what
the smart business move is. but

1219
00:50:21.896 --> 00:50:23.106
now there's this other voice

1220
00:50:23.148 --> 00:50:25.316
in my head
that's starting to nag at me.

1221
00:50:25.358 --> 00:50:27.986
I don't
know what the right move is.

1222
00:50:28.028 --> 00:50:29.154
Did you
ever have that struggle

1223
00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:31.114
when you were working?

1224
00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:32.615
Well. sure.

1225
00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:35.326
When I was a younger man.

1226
00:50:35.368 --> 00:50:38.830
I just would put my head down
and push through

1227
00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:42.625
whatever or whoever
was causing the problem.

1228
00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:45.754
get my business
goals in place.

1229
00:50:45.795 --> 00:50:46.629
I know.

1230
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:47.589
"Don't stop when you're tired.

1231
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.632
-Stop when you're done."
-Yeah.

1232
00:50:51.134 --> 00:50:54.679
Yeah. about that.

1233
00:50:57.807 --> 00:51:00.477
You know. your mother used to
put all these decorations up.

1234
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.936
I know.

1235
00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:03.271
It wasn't exactly your thing.

1236
00:51:03.313 --> 00:51:06.733
No. I was always rushing to
meetings.

1237
00:51:06.775 --> 00:51:08.401
closing deals.

1238
00:51:08.443 --> 00:51:11.029
trying to reach
some sort of brass ring.

1239
00:51:13.114 --> 00:51:15.408
She would just smile.

1240
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.161
and hum a Christmas carol.

1241
00:51:18.828 --> 00:51:22.332
and happily go about making our
home look so...

1242
00:51:24.959 --> 00:51:26.252
After she put these up.

1243
00:51:26.294 --> 00:51:30.590
people would walk by the house
and admire it.

1244
00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:33.134
Comment on the.
on the Christmas colours.

1245
00:51:33.176 --> 00:51:34.719
how they were perfectly hung

1246
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.806
and made our house
look so warm and friendly.

1247
00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:41.851
But nobody saw

1248
00:51:41.893 --> 00:51:44.813
the complicated mess
before they went up.

1249
00:51:44.854 --> 00:51:47.732
Nobody ever saw the homeowners
scratching their heads

1250
00:51:47.774 --> 00:51:49.317
and trying
to figure out the puzzle

1251
00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:51.027
and the hopelessness
of it all.

1252
00:51:53.154 --> 00:51:54.155
Okay.

1253
00:51:54.197 --> 00:51:56.032
It's all about perspective.

1254
00:51:56.074 --> 00:51:57.617
The holding in your mind's

1255
00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:00.870
eye what really matters
in the end.

1256
00:52:00.912 --> 00:52:03.498
sometimes things happen

1257
00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.459
that are beyond your control

1258
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:07.836
and that can knock

1259
00:52:07.877 --> 00:52:09.045
the wind out of you.

1260
00:52:10.171 --> 00:52:11.297
I lost someone

1261
00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:13.883
that meant the world to me.

1262
00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:17.971
But if I just think of her
smile

1263
00:52:18.013 --> 00:52:18.888
and hear her

1264
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.683
humming "Silent Night".

1265
00:52:21.725 --> 00:52:23.268
then suddenly a tangled mess

1266
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:25.395
becomes more manageable.

1267
00:52:27.105 --> 00:52:28.148
Don't bulldoze

1268
00:52:28.189 --> 00:52:29.899
your way through life
like I did.

1269
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:34.612
Find that part of your problem

1270
00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:37.532
that means the most to you

1271
00:52:37.574 --> 00:52:40.076
and focus on that.

1272
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.787
[gentle music]

1273
00:52:45.582 --> 00:52:48.543
I miss her too. Dad.

1274
00:52:52.797 --> 00:52:54.299
Okay.

1275
00:52:54.341 --> 00:52:55.300
let's go to the house.

1276
00:52:55.342 --> 00:52:57.177
I made some Christmas cookies.

1277
00:52:57.218 --> 00:52:58.345
You did?

1278
00:52:58.386 --> 00:53:01.264
Claire just made a batch.

1279
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:03.600
I love your sister.

1280
00:53:04.434 --> 00:53:06.144
but I'm not really
a gingerbread

1281
00:53:06.186 --> 00:53:07.687
kind of guy.

1282
00:53:10.899 --> 00:53:12.359
[tape tearing]

1283
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.694
See. this alone will add
value.

1284
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:16.738
[Bo] To people
checking into the B and B.

1285
00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.739
I know.

1286
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.074
You know
that wall is mostly beige.

1287
00:53:19.115 --> 00:53:21.076
and the red on the bottom
is just an accent colour.

1288
00:53:21.117 --> 00:53:24.162
So technically. I won.

1289
00:53:24.204 --> 00:53:26.247
Whatever you
gotta tell yourself.

1290
00:53:26.289 --> 00:53:27.248
[Abigial] Okay. so be honest.

1291
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.459
Why the B and B obsession?

1292
00:53:29.501 --> 00:53:30.960
You can't tell me that
changing bed sheets

1293
00:53:31.002 --> 00:53:33.254
and baking
muffins is your true calling.

1294
00:53:33.296 --> 00:53:36.466
Frank spent 104 years
loving life here.

1295
00:53:36.508 --> 00:53:37.717
and people will tell you

1296
00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:39.427
that he was the cornerstone
of the community.

1297
00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:41.096
But it wasn't just him.

1298
00:53:41.137 --> 00:53:43.056
It was this house.

1299
00:53:43.098 --> 00:53:44.432
He hosted Boy Scout meetings

1300
00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:47.227
here. annual
Christmas cookie exchanges.

1301
00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:50.605
dinners for people
who had nowhere else to go.

1302
00:53:51.523 --> 00:53:52.440
This place was somewhere

1303
00:53:52.482 --> 00:53:54.651
where you could slow down

1304
00:53:54.693 --> 00:53:56.986
and really connect with what
actually matters in life.

1305
00:53:58.571 --> 00:53:59.989
And opening a B and B
for visitors to do

1306
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:01.700
the same is exactly
what Frank would have wanted

1307
00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:04.619
and what this place
still needs.

1308
00:54:04.661 --> 00:54:06.079
I know he would have wanted it

1309
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:09.708
to continue
to be something special and

1310
00:54:09.749 --> 00:54:11.209
so do I.

1311
00:54:11.501 --> 00:54:12.877
-[paint brush thuds]
-[Abigail] Oh.

1312
00:54:16.297 --> 00:54:17.882
[Bo] Hey. um.

1313
00:54:18.508 --> 00:54:20.468
I know it's pretty late. but.

1314
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.512
you want to grab
something to eat?

1315
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:29.269
I'm familiar with your dining
preferences and I have a strict

1316
00:54:29.561 --> 00:54:31.396
no ho ho hotdogs

1317
00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:33.690
before bed policy.

1318
00:54:34.858 --> 00:54:37.193
Besides. I've got some work
I've got to catch up on.

1319
00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:41.281
Right. yeah. Work.

1320
00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:42.782
Some other time. then.

1321
00:54:44.034 --> 00:54:45.535
Yeah.

1322
00:54:45.577 --> 00:54:47.245
another time.

1323
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:51.791
I swear I never intended
for any of this to happen

1324
00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:53.335
when I mentioned it
to Jessica.

1325
00:54:53.376 --> 00:54:56.921
And now Antonio wants to buy
the lot and gentrify the area.

1326
00:54:57.756 --> 00:54:58.882
It's just so funny.

1327
00:54:58.923 --> 00:55:00.091
All these years
I've come to visit you.

1328
00:55:00.133 --> 00:55:02.886
I never spent
any time in your community.

1329
00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.473
I see why you love it.
but I don't know what to do.

1330
00:55:06.514 --> 00:55:07.932
Do I tell Bo now?

1331
00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:09.392
Do I not tell Bo?

1332
00:55:09.434 --> 00:55:11.144
Oh. I feel sick about what
I've done.

1333
00:55:11.186 --> 00:55:13.313
Abby.

1334
00:55:13.355 --> 00:55:16.566
I think you
have feelings for Bo.

1335
00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:19.069
No.

1336
00:55:19.361 --> 00:55:22.655
No. Okay. maybe. Yes.

1337
00:55:22.697 --> 00:55:23.865
Maybe I have feelings for him.

1338
00:55:23.907 --> 00:55:26.368
And maybe I just destroyed
his entire life

1339
00:55:26.409 --> 00:55:28.244
and ruined everyone's
Christmas.

1340
00:55:28.995 --> 00:55:31.414
My string of lights
are so tangled.

1341
00:55:31.456 --> 00:55:34.876
Well.
you lost me with that one.

1342
00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:36.711
Well I tried to ask
Dad for business

1343
00:55:36.753 --> 00:55:40.382
advice. but.
you know. instead. he just.

1344
00:55:40.423 --> 00:55:42.717
He tries to be all stoic.

1345
00:55:44.386 --> 00:55:45.470
I think he really regrets what

1346
00:55:45.512 --> 00:55:47.806
he sacrificed for his career.

1347
00:55:48.264 --> 00:55:50.350
Things he'll never get back.

1348
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:53.061
I can't make the same mistake
as him. Claire.

1349
00:55:53.103 --> 00:55:54.562
I have to figure out a way
to fix this.

1350
00:55:54.604 --> 00:55:55.605
It's okay.

1351
00:55:55.647 --> 00:55:57.649
We can figure it out together.

1352
00:55:57.691 --> 00:55:59.818
I mean. one of the perks
of living in a small community

1353
00:55:59.859 --> 00:56:02.320
is that you know everyone.

1354
00:56:02.362 --> 00:56:03.446
And I

1355
00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:06.116
just so happen to know
the mayor.

1356
00:56:06.157 --> 00:56:07.992
Well. technically.
I take yoga with his wife.

1357
00:56:08.034 --> 00:56:09.703
but close enough.

1358
00:56:11.955 --> 00:56:13.998
Thank you.

1359
00:56:14.332 --> 00:56:15.542
And you're okay with how

1360
00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:17.877
this might affect
your big work deal?

1361
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:21.297
Well no. I mean. I haven't even
really thought that far.

1362
00:56:21.339 --> 00:56:22.382
You should get some sleep.

1363
00:56:22.424 --> 00:56:25.093
Everything is clear
in the morning.

1364
00:56:25.135 --> 00:56:27.971
[gentle music]

1365
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:30.098
Hey. did you know that Bo

1366
00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.100
used to be a bit of a rebel
when he was younger.

1367
00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:34.102
and he went through
a dark period?

1368
00:56:34.144 --> 00:56:35.562
I did.

1369
00:56:35.603 --> 00:56:38.023
Amazing how
some people can change. huh?

1370
00:56:39.774 --> 00:56:41.109
Did you want
me to turn out the lights?

1371
00:56:41.151 --> 00:56:42.152
No. it's okay.

1372
00:56:42.193 --> 00:56:43.737
I still have some work
I got to do.

1373
00:56:43.778 --> 00:56:45.780
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

1374
00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:54.330
[keyboard clicking]

1375
00:57:00.462 --> 00:57:01.504
So we explain the situation

1376
00:57:01.546 --> 00:57:02.589
to the mayor
and ask him to put a.

1377
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.049
stop to the sale of the land.

1378
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:05.216
Right.

1379
00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:09.637
What's wrong?
You seem nervous.

1380
00:57:09.679 --> 00:57:10.930
I thought presenting
was your thing?

1381
00:57:10.972 --> 00:57:12.015
It is.

1382
00:57:12.057 --> 00:57:14.559
You know. it's
just not usually

1383
00:57:14.601 --> 00:57:15.727
to Santa.

1384
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:19.105
You'll be fine. Let's go.

1385
00:57:22.734 --> 00:57:24.194
Morning Mayor Kumar!

1386
00:57:24.235 --> 00:57:25.779
Ah. Claire.

1387
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.947
Cathy says you weren't at yoga
this morning.

1388
00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:31.326
Well. my downward
dog needed a cat nap.

1389
00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:34.662
-This is my sister. Abby.
-Hey! How are ya?

1390
00:57:34.704 --> 00:57:36.623
Mr. Mayor. Your Honour.

1391
00:57:36.915 --> 00:57:38.708
Is it your Honour?

1392
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.710
Sir Santa? Nope.
That doesn't sound right.

1393
00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:43.046
-Mayor Kumar is fine.
-Great.

1394
00:57:43.088 --> 00:57:46.675
Mayor Kumar. I understand that
DevaCore has put in an offer

1395
00:57:46.716 --> 00:57:48.677
to buy that vacant
lot here in Brenbury.

1396
00:57:48.968 --> 00:57:52.180
Yes. How did you find that out?

1397
00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:53.640
Well. that

1398
00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:54.891
doesn't really matter.

1399
00:57:54.933 --> 00:57:56.226
If they buy that land.

1400
00:57:56.267 --> 00:57:57.852
they're going
to put in a big high rise

1401
00:57:57.894 --> 00:58:00.772
condo with coffee
chains and box stores.

1402
00:58:00.814 --> 00:58:02.732
That's called investing money
into our community.

1403
00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:04.234
That's a good thing.

1404
00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:06.986
They will come in and bulldoze
through everything.

1405
00:58:07.028 --> 00:58:09.280
They will heartlessly rip
the roots of this town

1406
00:58:09.322 --> 00:58:12.242
up the ground and completely
change the way of life here.

1407
00:58:12.283 --> 00:58:14.536
DevaCore
will gentrify the entire area.

1408
00:58:14.577 --> 00:58:15.662
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1409
00:58:15.704 --> 00:58:16.955
Who said anything
about gentrification?

1410
00:58:16.996 --> 00:58:18.915
The CEO of DevaCore.

1411
00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.585
Look at this.

1412
00:58:22.627 --> 00:58:25.296
This is Brenbury now
full of shops.

1413
00:58:25.338 --> 00:58:28.299
parks. food truck.
the Christmas tree farm.

1414
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:30.260
-Fred's barber shop.
-Fred.

1415
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:33.888
I've been going to Fred
for 35 years.

1416
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:36.891
This community is so warm
and welcoming.

1417
00:58:36.933 --> 00:58:38.685
Everyone's
in the Christmas spirit.

1418
00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:40.645
So stress free.

1419
00:58:40.687 --> 00:58:42.313
But DevaCore

1420
00:58:42.355 --> 00:58:45.150
will change it
to this fast food franchises.

1421
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:48.278
Tree farms turn to parking
lots. overpriced coffee

1422
00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:51.698
chains. box stores.
super clubs hair cutters.

1423
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.366
Bye bye. Fred.

1424
00:58:53.408 --> 00:58:54.701
I understand.

1425
00:58:54.743 --> 00:58:56.953
But it's about balancing

1426
00:58:56.995 --> 00:58:59.289
budgets and allocating funds.

1427
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:00.832
Running a municipality

1428
00:59:00.874 --> 00:59:03.668
is about fixing roads.

1429
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:06.129
collecting garbage.
shoveling sidewalks

1430
00:59:06.171 --> 00:59:08.298
and keeping
the Christmas lights on.

1431
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:11.968
This deal will provide
an influx of funds and

1432
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.011
relieve the pressure.

1433
00:59:15.347 --> 00:59:17.640
However.

1434
00:59:17.682 --> 00:59:20.101
this is
not what I had in mind.

1435
00:59:22.479 --> 00:59:23.521
Okay.

1436
00:59:23.563 --> 00:59:25.774
I'll take it under advisement.

1437
00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:28.485
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I have a toy

1438
00:59:28.526 --> 00:59:29.944
drive to tend to.

1439
00:59:31.696 --> 00:59:33.990
One of the perks of the job.

1440
00:59:34.032 --> 00:59:35.492
Of course.
Thank you for your time.

1441
00:59:35.533 --> 00:59:37.035
Thank you. Mayor Kumar.

1442
00:59:38.703 --> 00:59:40.497
Gee. you did it!

1443
00:59:40.538 --> 00:59:41.456
We'll see.

1444
00:59:41.498 --> 00:59:42.499
The mayor is a smart guy.

1445
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.667
He'll do the right thing.

1446
00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:45.919
Now. I am kid
free for the morning.

1447
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.253
So let's go do something
fun and kidless.

1448
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.589
Okay.

1449
00:59:49.631 --> 00:59:51.466
You want to see how the house
is coming along?

1450
00:59:51.508 --> 00:59:52.634
Yes. yes.

1451
00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:54.386
Yes. I do.

1452
00:59:59.182 --> 01:00:03.311
-Wow. This is incredible.
-[gentle music]

1453
01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:05.397
It. it is.

1454
01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.569
Where did all this stuff
come from?

1455
01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:15.865
This is all the furniture
I wanted.

1456
01:00:15.907 --> 01:00:18.535
The walls are beige and red.

1457
01:00:18.576 --> 01:00:20.161
Why are you surprised?

1458
01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:22.122
I thought the two of you
worked on this together.

1459
01:00:22.163 --> 01:00:24.374
We did. but not. not all this.

1460
01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:26.543
This is so...

1461
01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:28.628
Festive.

1462
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:29.421
Our tree.

1463
01:00:36.177 --> 01:00:38.513
Santas. not so little helper.

1464
01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:46.771
Hey. hey. hi. hey.

1465
01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:48.481
How did you?

1466
01:00:48.523 --> 01:00:49.941
What time is it?

1467
01:00:49.983 --> 01:00:52.402
-10:30.
-A.M.?

1468
01:00:52.444 --> 01:00:54.362
Did you do all this?

1469
01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:56.156
Oh. yeah. I. uh.

1470
01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:58.992
I guess I got a
little carried away.

1471
01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:01.953
I mean. it took her

1472
01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:03.246
two colours and made them work
so well together last night.

1473
01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:04.330
I just figured I'd keep going.

1474
01:01:04.372 --> 01:01:06.791
And maybe add little holiday
spirit.

1475
01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:07.709
Too much?

1476
01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.836
No. no. it all looks amazing.

1477
01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:11.046
I'm just surprised

1478
01:01:11.087 --> 01:01:13.048
because the accents.
the furniture. pieces.

1479
01:01:13.089 --> 01:01:14.674
these were all my choices.

1480
01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:17.218
Really? Wow. Yeah.
Look at that.

1481
01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:19.721
I guess you got pretty good
taste then.

1482
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.056
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1483
01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:22.849
I mean. your work
ethic is a little

1484
01:01:22.891 --> 01:01:23.767
questionable.
but your taste is--

1485
01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:25.101
Excuse me?

1486
01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:26.519
I'm just saying I was here
working all night.

1487
01:01:26.561 --> 01:01:28.021
You were out gallivanting.

1488
01:01:28.063 --> 01:01:30.607
Gallivanting? Where have I
been gallivanting in Brenbury?

1489
01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:32.025
Brenbury is very gallivant-able.

1490
01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:34.611
-Trust me. Yeah.
-Is it?

1491
01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:36.279
[Claire] Anyway.

1492
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:38.114
it looks like you two
have the place almost ready

1493
01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:40.784
for what exactly?

1494
01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:42.452
-A sale.
-B and B.

1495
01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:44.996
Super. Okay. well.

1496
01:01:45.038 --> 01:01:46.915
I still have a few hours of me
time before I have

1497
01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:48.249
to go back to the circus.

1498
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.501
So I'm going to go
do some last-minute shopping.

1499
01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:51.628
Countdown
to Christmas morning chaos.

1500
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:53.505
I will leave you two to it.

1501
01:01:57.258 --> 01:02:00.095
Look this all looks amazing
and you did great.

1502
01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:02.097
But I still think flipping
this place--

1503
01:02:02.138 --> 01:02:05.809
Just maybe it'd be best if we

1504
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.977
talked it out over dinner.

1505
01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.896
Like a date?

1506
01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:11.981
No. not a date.

1507
01:02:12.023 --> 01:02:13.066
A date date?

1508
01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:15.860
More like a. like a business

1509
01:02:15.902 --> 01:02:17.946
date thing.

1510
01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:20.657
Will we be sitting when we eat?

1511
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.367
Don't push your luck.

1512
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.831
[Bo] It's pretty amazing. huh?

1513
01:02:27.872 --> 01:02:29.874
[Abigail] It's breathtaking.

1514
01:02:29.916 --> 01:02:31.710
So peaceful.

1515
01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:36.256
And it never gets old.

1516
01:02:38.883 --> 01:02:41.928
Is that
downtown over the tree line?

1517
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.930
Yeah.

1518
01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:45.932
I love the core.

1519
01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:48.059
The bright lights.

1520
01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:51.062
where all the action is.

1521
01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:52.856
If you ask me.

1522
01:02:52.897 --> 01:02:54.858
that's
where all the action is.

1523
01:02:54.899 --> 01:02:57.527
Something
the urbanites can't see.

1524
01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.695
What do you mean?

1525
01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:00.321
Well.

1526
01:03:00.363 --> 01:03:03.324
despite being too preoccupied
and distracted

1527
01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:06.202
to actually look up and gain
some perspective.

1528
01:03:06.244 --> 01:03:08.830
all the lights ruin
the opportunity.

1529
01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:13.126
They miss out
on the beauty of life.

1530
01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:17.839
The brighter the skyline.
the dimmer the stars.

1531
01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:21.551
That's beautiful.

1532
01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:23.178
Dr. Seuss?

1533
01:03:24.596 --> 01:03:26.723
No. it's an original

1534
01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:28.516
wrote it myself. actually.

1535
01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:30.935
Should put that on a T-shirt.
sell it online.

1536
01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:32.896
Wow. always
looking to make a profit.

1537
01:03:32.937 --> 01:03:34.439
huh Jones?

1538
01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:37.108
Don't shortchange downtown
life.

1539
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.319
There's a certain energy

1540
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:42.405
and pace to it
that can be invigorating.

1541
01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:44.366
Although.

1542
01:03:44.407 --> 01:03:46.493
I'm starting
to see the appeal here.

1543
01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:51.623
Thank you
for all your hard work and

1544
01:03:51.664 --> 01:03:54.250
showing me what life
in Brenbury is like.

1545
01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.294
Yeah. my pleasure.

1546
01:03:56.628 --> 01:03:59.464
[gentle music]

1547
01:03:59.798 --> 01:04:01.591
I'm really glad you came.

1548
01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:06.137
-[phone chimes]
-[phone vibrates]

1549
01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:08.181
I'm so sorry.

1550
01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:09.474
I thought I turned that off.

1551
01:04:09.808 --> 01:04:12.143
Just. oh boy.

1552
01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:14.854
Would you kill me
if I got this?

1553
01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:16.231
It'll be super quick.
I promise.

1554
01:04:16.272 --> 01:04:17.440
I think I know
what he's going to say.

1555
01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:18.983
I just want to hear it
in real time.

1556
01:04:19.025 --> 01:04:20.276
-Really?
-Two seconds.

1557
01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:21.653
Don't go anywhere.

1558
01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:27.492
Hey. Antonio.

1559
01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:29.619
Look. I know it's late.
but I just want to let

1560
01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:33.039
you know that our offer to buy
the Brenbury property

1561
01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:33.873
was declined.

1562
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.210
Oh. no.

1563
01:04:37.252 --> 01:04:38.628
that's too bad.

1564
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.796
I'm sorry.

1565
01:04:39.838 --> 01:04:41.297
So. I had to add another

1566
01:04:41.339 --> 01:04:44.300
ten percent to the offer.
and he jumped at it.

1567
01:04:44.342 --> 01:04:46.302
We got it. Abigail.

1568
01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:48.972
I'll be there day after
tomorrow to sign the deal.

1569
01:04:49.014 --> 01:04:51.641
That is so great.

1570
01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.811
I can't believe it either.

1571
01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:56.855
Congratulations to you. too.

1572
01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.649
Yeah.

1573
01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:03.653
[Bo] Hey. Everything okay?

1574
01:05:03.695 --> 01:05:04.738
Yeah. Yeah.

1575
01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:06.364
No. Totally great.

1576
01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.159
Huh? Oh. wow.

1577
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.661
I'm actually
feeling pretty tired.

1578
01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:14.080
and I think
I should call it a night.

1579
01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:15.582
So if you want to just

1580
01:05:15.623 --> 01:05:18.001
scoot me home real quick.
that that would be great.

1581
01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:19.586
Hang on. Hang on.

1582
01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:21.588
What's going on?

1583
01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:26.176
Before I left the city.

1584
01:05:26.217 --> 01:05:28.053
I landed this
really big client.

1585
01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:30.847
They build condos
and housing developments.

1586
01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:33.808
It was a really big opportunity
that I was very excited about.

1587
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:34.809
Was?

1588
01:05:36.061 --> 01:05:37.354
When you told me
about that land for sale

1589
01:05:37.395 --> 01:05:38.772
and how there might be

1590
01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:41.358
a new community centre
or a new church or something.

1591
01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:43.610
I mentioned the vacant

1592
01:05:43.651 --> 01:05:46.196
lot to my assistant.
a very matter of fact.

1593
01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:48.698
passing comment.
Totally harmless.

1594
01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.699
Go on.

1595
01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:51.451
She told
the guy who runs DevaCore.

1596
01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:54.662
and the next thing I knew.
he pounced on it and

1597
01:05:54.704 --> 01:05:57.207
made an offer to buy the land
and build condos on it.

1598
01:05:57.248 --> 01:06:00.210
And now I guess
the mayor accepted the offer.

1599
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.170
Wait.

1600
01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:03.171
so your client is going

1601
01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.215
to build condos in Brenbury?

1602
01:06:05.256 --> 01:06:06.925
-For starters? Yes.
-For starters?

1603
01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:10.595
They're all about
urbanization.

1604
01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:13.223
Eventually. they'll buy up
more land and build

1605
01:06:13.264 --> 01:06:16.017
high-rise buildings
and parking lots. and--

1606
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:18.019
Please stop. stop. stop.

1607
01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:19.229
I'm so sorry. Bo.

1608
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.189
You used me.

1609
01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:22.357
You just want some
big business deal.

1610
01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:23.692
So you used me to get to know
Brenbury.

1611
01:06:23.733 --> 01:06:25.235
You don't care
what this place means to me.

1612
01:06:25.276 --> 01:06:27.070
You just. you just wanted
your hooks in the land.

1613
01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:28.113
No. no. no. no.

1614
01:06:28.154 --> 01:06:29.906
-It's not like that.
-Unbelievable.

1615
01:06:29.948 --> 01:06:31.408
I finally start to open up

1616
01:06:31.449 --> 01:06:34.035
and have feelings for someone.

1617
01:06:34.994 --> 01:06:36.246
You know. you're obviously

1618
01:06:36.287 --> 01:06:39.624
very good at what you do.
and I respect that. But.

1619
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:41.543
at what price?

1620
01:06:41.584 --> 01:06:44.295
-Good luck with your big deal.
-[soft music]

1621
01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:46.631
I'll drive you home. but after
we finish flipping the house

1622
01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.633
then we should go
our separate ways.

1623
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.653
-What's wrong?
-Well.

1624
01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.405
I just explained to Bo.
and I'm worse

1625
01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:11.406
than a home wrecker.

1626
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:13.366
I'm an entire community
wrecker.

1627
01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.909
And at Christmas.

1628
01:07:14.951 --> 01:07:17.412
His Majesty mayor rejected
the original offer.

1629
01:07:17.454 --> 01:07:20.248
but then accepted
a counteroffer.

1630
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.416
They close the deal
in the morning.

1631
01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:23.126
Oh. shoot.

1632
01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:26.921
Bo hates me now.
so that's over.

1633
01:07:26.963 --> 01:07:28.465
And who can blame him?

1634
01:07:28.506 --> 01:07:30.592
I'm part of the problem.

1635
01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:31.926
and I've completely destroyed

1636
01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:33.845
his life in the process.

1637
01:07:36.514 --> 01:07:39.601
[soft music continues]

1638
01:07:44.814 --> 01:07:46.858
You know. you and I
were cut from the same cloth.

1639
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:51.363
but we always saw
things a little differently.

1640
01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:53.615
You held
Dad in such high regard

1641
01:07:53.656 --> 01:07:56.159
and always wanted his approval
for your life choices.

1642
01:07:56.201 --> 01:08:00.580
But he's a different person
from a different time.

1643
01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:04.292
And maybe it's not our job

1644
01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:07.087
to achieve someone else's
happiness.

1645
01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:15.845
Come here. Come here.
Come on. come on. come on.

1646
01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:18.556
[bright music]

1647
01:08:21.142 --> 01:08:22.227
So a couple of years ago.

1648
01:08:22.268 --> 01:08:23.978
John was playing
Karate Kid with the boys.

1649
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.898
The kids won.
and this door lost.

1650
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.484
Dylan put his foot.
like right through it.

1651
01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:32.028
So we hired
Bo to build us a new door.

1652
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:33.196
It's nice. huh?

1653
01:08:34.864 --> 01:08:36.825
It's a solid oak door
that's been painted.

1654
01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:37.909
It's fine.

1655
01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:39.160
Is there a point?

1656
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.287
Fine? Come on.

1657
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:42.622
Look at this.

1658
01:08:42.664 --> 01:08:45.166
He is quite the craftsman.

1659
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:47.669
He put so much thought
into all of his work.

1660
01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:52.173
And I think the point is
that you should pay

1661
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:55.677
more attention when you're
working in our guest office.

1662
01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:57.554
Because he carved this

1663
01:08:57.595 --> 01:08:59.639
beautiful saying on the back.

1664
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:04.853
I think you found your new door.

1665
01:09:04.894 --> 01:09:07.230
-But how am I supposed to--
-[Claire] Ow!

1666
01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:11.276
If these boys have been told

1667
01:09:11.317 --> 01:09:13.194
once they've been told
a million times. these animals

1668
01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:15.363
are kept in a specific place.

1669
01:09:15.405 --> 01:09:18.491
Boys.
come and put your toys away!

1670
01:09:18.533 --> 01:09:20.910
A fox can't just
live anywhere. you know?

1671
01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:23.246
[bright music]

1672
01:09:25.081 --> 01:09:27.625
-[Jessica] Hey!
-Jess? I need your help.

1673
01:09:28.501 --> 01:09:32.922
[bright festive music]

1674
01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:38.720
* When I think about the time
when I was young*

1675
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.807
* All I see is snow*

1676
01:09:42.849 --> 01:09:45.894
* Bells and mistletoes*

1677
01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:50.357
* All December I stay
home and pick my brain*

1678
01:09:51.608 --> 01:09:54.402
* Just to find a way*

1679
01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:57.655
* To make a Christmas day*

1680
01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:07.624
[curious music]

1681

-[car door slams]
-[car alarm beeps]

1683
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.261
So what do you think?

1684
01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:22.722
I'd like to see the property
before we sign.

1685
01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:24.099
Great.
It's just down the street.

1686
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.100
A walk or a drive?

1687
01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:26.351
Oh. it's just a block.

1688
01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:27.268
Understood.

1689
01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:31.523
Oh. sir.

1690
01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:33.650
Right. Yeah. Driving.

1691
01:10:36.403 --> 01:10:38.154
[soft music]

1692
01:10:39.656 --> 01:10:41.241
I hope she likes it.

1693
01:10:43.743 --> 01:10:45.537
Excuse me? Hi.
What's happening here?

1694
01:10:46.162 --> 01:10:48.998
Oh. he does this
every year on the 24th.

1695
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.792
The kids think he's
Santa's associate.

1696
01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:53.628
so they all place their orders
directly with him.

1697
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.380
I'm not convinced
they're wrong.

1698
01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:57.674
He made Ella this
beautiful sled.

1699
01:10:58.466 --> 01:11:00.260
Merry Christmas.

1700
01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.472
So they'll just fly in here

1701
01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:06.266
and make it a little home.

1702
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.185
There you are.
Merry Christmas.

1703
01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:20.905
You're amazing.

1704
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:24.200
Sorry. I'm closing up.

1705
01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:27.412
I'm done.

1706
01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:29.539
by the way.

1707
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:32.042
What. what's that
supposed to mean?

1708
01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:34.544
Like. "Don't stop
when you're tired.

1709
01:11:34.586 --> 01:11:36.504
Stop when you're done."

1710
01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:37.881
I'm done.

1711
01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:42.344
I realized there's.

1712
01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:44.804
there is no finish line.

1713
01:11:44.846 --> 01:11:47.599
It's just an endless.
exhausting race

1714
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.726
with no substance.

1715
01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:55.190
That's great.

1716
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:56.816
I'm happy for you. okay?

1717
01:11:58.276 --> 01:11:59.819
Now. if you don't mind.

1718
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.324
It's because I found this
beautiful place

1719
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:10.205
where everyone is so relaxed
and authentic and happy.

1720
01:12:10.747 --> 01:12:13.792
And I found.

1721
01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:16.795
-I found you.
-[soft music]

1722
01:12:17.253 --> 01:12:18.463
I found you. Bo.

1723
01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:26.012
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1724
01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:28.890
Not the slip up
with my assistant.

1725
01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:32.018
not the land being bought.

1726
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.229
and not these feelings
for you. but they did.

1727
01:12:35.605 --> 01:12:38.400
And now...

1728
01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:40.819
Now what?

1729
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:43.113
Listen. I don't expect you to

1730
01:12:43.154 --> 01:12:45.865
forgive me or understand
any of this.

1731
01:12:48.284 --> 01:12:51.121
I just want you to know
how deeply sorry I am.

1732
01:12:58.294 --> 01:13:01.423
I'm gonna.
I'm going to go now and

1733
01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:04.801
try to fix this.

1734
01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:07.137
Or if I can't just

1735
01:13:07.178 --> 01:13:09.139
go back home.

1736
01:13:11.182 --> 01:13:13.476
Just please remember that
I'm so sorry.

1737
01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:17.313
Me too.

1738
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.151
[soft music continues]

1739
01:13:28.074 --> 01:13:30.785
[Kumar] Welcome to Brenbury
and season's greetings.

1740
01:13:30.827 --> 01:13:32.871
Sorry. I lost track of time.

1741
01:13:32.912 --> 01:13:35.415
Just trying to make sure
the less fortunate kids

1742
01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:38.877
in the area get lots of love
from Santa. too.

1743
01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:40.920
Antonio is a very busy man.

1744
01:13:40.962 --> 01:13:42.922
so if you could just move
this along.

1745
01:13:42.964 --> 01:13:45.050
Yes. of course.

1746
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:47.093
Your counter offer for this

1747
01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:50.638
one piece of property
was too good to resist.

1748
01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.474
Good then.

1749
01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:53.933
You have the cheque?

1750
01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:56.394
Yes. I sure do.

1751
01:13:59.314 --> 01:14:03.234
This will fix
a lot of potholes.

1752
01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:05.820
-Wait.
-[Kumar] Um. excuse me?

1753
01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:07.530
We're in the middle
of something here.

1754
01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:08.782
Abigail?

1755
01:14:08.823 --> 01:14:09.866
Antonio.

1756
01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:11.368
Blair.

1757
01:14:11.409 --> 01:14:13.036
Sorry. Mr. Mayor. but

1758
01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:15.372
looks like DevaCore can't
make this purchase after all.

1759
01:14:15.413 --> 01:14:17.374
-What?
-Excuse me?

1760
01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:19.292
This deal
has been eating away at me.

1761
01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:22.379
And then yesterday.
I remembered what Bo told me

1762
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.756
about all the animals
that call that land home.

1763
01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:26.758
So I researched local Brenbury
bylaws and

1764
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.468
I had my assistant
talk to the Department

1765
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:32.055
of Environmental Protection.
and it turns out I was right.

1766
01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:34.974
This property qualifies as
environmentally protected land.

1767
01:14:35.892 --> 01:14:37.102
See now that it's owned
by Brenbury

1768
01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:39.145
and not owned privately.
it has to adhere

1769
01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:41.189
to these bylaws
and regulations.

1770
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:43.692
Mayor Kumar. We had a deal.

1771
01:14:44.317 --> 01:14:46.027
[Abigail] It says right here.

1772
01:14:48.613 --> 01:14:50.657
"Pursuant to paragraph 26.

1773
01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:52.492
any development
or construction

1774
01:14:52.534 --> 01:14:55.578
on protected property
must be presented. voted on

1775
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.581
and passed by the board
as per the bylaw regulations."

1776
01:14:58.623 --> 01:15:00.583
What? This is ridiculous.

1777
01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.252
[Abigail] However.

1778
01:15:02.293 --> 01:15:04.421
if we keep the protected land.
we can build this

1779
01:15:04.462 --> 01:15:07.007
great not-for-profit
community centre.

1780
01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:09.175
Huge benefits
for the residents.

1781
01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:10.885
There's a playground
for the kids.

1782
01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:12.387
Outdoor festival grounds.

1783
01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:15.974
Charity fundraisers.
Christmas fairs in the winter.

1784
01:15:16.474 --> 01:15:19.936
There's a castle and a chair
where you can play Santa.

1785
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:21.938
Tourists coming in
from all over to help

1786
01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.940
support
local small businesses.

1787
01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:26.109
And while they're here.

1788
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:28.486
they can stay at a quaint bed
and breakfast.

1789
01:15:28.528 --> 01:15:30.739
Well. this would be nice
for the community.

1790
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.990
And yes.

1791
01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:33.950
there will be less money
in the bank at first.

1792
01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:35.827
but you'll be saving
the protected land

1793
01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:38.997
and you'll keep Brenbury.
Brenbury.

1794
01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:41.458
[Antonio] Mayor Kumar.

1795
01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:43.001
We had a deal.

1796
01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:52.427
[papers tearing]

1797
01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:53.803
Bottles will have to wait.

1798
01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:55.805
[bright festive music]

1799
01:15:56.097 --> 01:15:57.390
She was your idea.

1800
01:15:57.432 --> 01:16:00.894
To be fair. college
was a very long time ago.

1801
01:16:00.935 --> 01:16:02.395
Hey. Antonio.

1802
01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:04.439
Remember in our first meeting
when you said I had a keen

1803
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:07.484
eye and can see value where
others see nothing at all?

1804
01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:09.277
Well. you were right.

1805
01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:11.654
I've decided to re-imagine
my client base

1806
01:16:11.696 --> 01:16:12.614
and resign your account.

1807
01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:16.117
Merry Christmas.

1808
01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:19.537
You know what?
You will regret this.

1809
01:16:24.376 --> 01:16:28.088
Well. thank you. Miss Jones.

1810
01:16:28.129 --> 01:16:29.631
I guess your work here is done.

1811
01:16:31.883 --> 01:16:33.218
Not quite.

1812
01:16:38.973 --> 01:16:40.350
Hey. Oh.

1813
01:16:40.392 --> 01:16:41.309
Oh. Oh.

1814
01:16:41.726 --> 01:16:42.519
[Bo] You scared me.

1815
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.270
Sorry.

1816
01:16:44.312 --> 01:16:46.064
No. no. it's okay.
I was actually just

1817
01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:47.524
-going to come look for you.
-What?

1818
01:16:47.565 --> 01:16:49.192
Look.
I realize that none of this

1819
01:16:49.234 --> 01:16:50.193
is actually your fault. okay?

1820
01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:51.528
It was obviously an accident

1821
01:16:51.569 --> 01:16:52.737
that just snowballed
out of control.

1822
01:16:52.779 --> 01:16:53.738
And the truth is.
that meeting you

1823
01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.615
has changed everything for me.

1824
01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:56.574
It doesn't matter anymore.

1825
01:16:56.616 --> 01:16:59.077
-[Bo rambles]
-Bo. it's over.

1826
01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:03.373
All right? Um.

1827
01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:05.208
It was nice getting to know you.

1828
01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:07.627
No. no. no.
The problem is over.

1829
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:09.546
I killed the sale.
No more DevaCore.

1830
01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:12.382
-What? You're kidding.
-No.

1831
01:17:12.424 --> 01:17:15.051
No. I stopped the sale
and dropped them as a client.

1832
01:17:15.093 --> 01:17:17.721
Wait. so Brenbury
stays exactly as it is?

1833
01:17:17.762 --> 01:17:19.055
Well.

1834
01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:21.891
It's just missing
one more thing.

1835
01:17:21.933 --> 01:17:25.729
-What's that?
-A bed and breakfast.

1836
01:17:29.107 --> 01:17:30.775
-[phone chimes]
-[phone vibrates]

1837
01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:32.986
Claire wants to know
how it went.

1838
01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:35.238
-Ah.
-Great.

1839
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.575
Exclamation mark. exclamation
mark. exclamation mark.

1840
01:17:38.616 --> 01:17:40.285
Fill you in shortly.

1841
01:17:41.369 --> 01:17:43.830
Do you want to come with me
to tell my sister?

1842
01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:45.040
You betcha.

1843
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:47.500
[festive jazz music]

1844
01:17:52.297 --> 01:17:54.424
"I've reimagined my client
list."

1845
01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:56.634
-You actually. Said that?
-Sure did.

1846
01:17:56.676 --> 01:18:00.472
So you gave up that huge
account for Brenbury?

1847
01:18:00.513 --> 01:18:02.432
After consulting
with a very wise man

1848
01:18:02.474 --> 01:18:04.100
who lives in your guest house.

1849
01:18:04.142 --> 01:18:06.478
Garage.

1850
01:18:06.519 --> 01:18:09.022
Well. besides.
I think it was the lesser

1851
01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:11.191
of the two things
I could have lost.

1852
01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:14.277
Hey. I hate to throw a wrench
into the celebration.

1853
01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:17.822
but we still have issue
of the inheritance house.

1854
01:18:17.864 --> 01:18:20.784
Huh? Well. I think
we have a solution for that.

1855
01:18:20.825 --> 01:18:22.369
If we can get the bed
and breakfast ready

1856
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.412
within the next
four to six weeks.

1857
01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:26.998
it could start to a profit
within two months.

1858
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.500
You guys will be silent
partners.

1859
01:18:28.541 --> 01:18:30.335
which would give you
an ongoing bump in monthly

1860
01:18:30.377 --> 01:18:32.295
income
to help with living expenses.

1861
01:18:32.337 --> 01:18:35.340
And in the meantime.
Bo has offered to donate

1862
01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:38.635
some of his time and labour
to doing renovations here

1863
01:18:38.677 --> 01:18:41.971
for the extension
and living space for Dad.

1864
01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:43.098
That's amazing. Thank you.

1865
01:18:43.139 --> 01:18:45.308
Thank you. Wow.

1866
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.812
[Edward] Ho ho ho. Ho ho.
Merry Christmas!

1867
01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:50.438
[both] Santa!

[uplifting festive music]

1869
01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:57.654
Santa! Santa!

1870
01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:59.531
Hello. little ones!

1871
01:18:59.572 --> 01:19:01.700
Have you been good boys
this year?

1872
01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:02.575
-Yes.
-Yes.

1873
01:19:02.617 --> 01:19:03.451
It's debatable.

1874
01:19:03.493 --> 01:19:05.203
-Are you sure?
-[both] Yes.

1875
01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:07.080
Here's one for you

1876
01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:08.665
and one for you.

1877
01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:11.543
Hurry inside
before you catch a chill.

1878
01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:15.547
Merry Christmas. Dad.

1879
01:19:19.467 --> 01:19:22.387
'Twas the night
before Christmas

1880
01:19:22.429 --> 01:19:24.848
with Edward in the garage

1881
01:19:24.889 --> 01:19:27.600
and all the festive joy
that he tried so hard

1882
01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:28.810
to dodge.

1883
01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:33.481
His dear wife passed.

1884
01:19:34.607 --> 01:19:36.609
leaving him alone
with his girls.

1885
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:42.490
He realized he was missing out
on their world.

1886
01:19:43.825 --> 01:19:47.746
but with a little untangling
and opening his heart.

1887
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.877
Edward gets to share

1888
01:19:53.918 --> 01:19:55.837
in a brand new start.

1889
01:19:57.047 --> 01:20:00.508
[bright festive music]

1890
01:20:08.266 --> 01:20:10.852
Your mother would be so proud
of you.

1891
01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:12.270
Both of you.

1892
01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:14.689
And I am. too.

1893
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:16.858
I am going to get Santa
the most delicious

1895
01:20:19.778 --> 01:20:21.654
Oh. yuck.

1896
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.626
Good morning. You're up early.

1897
01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:37.128
All the Christmas gifts
get opened already?

1898
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.880
-Just under three minutes.
-Really?

1899
01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:42.926
A new record and the craziest
thing I've ever seen.

1900
01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:46.805
Can I get you a hot chocolate?

1901
01:20:46.846 --> 01:20:48.223
[Abigail] No. I'm okay.

1902
01:20:48.264 --> 01:20:50.100
Just wanted to come by
and thank you.

1903
01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:51.643
Thank me?

1904
01:20:51.685 --> 01:20:52.936
But you didn't
get to flip this place.

1905
01:20:52.977 --> 01:20:54.062
True.

1906
01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:56.064
I did lose that.

1907
01:20:56.106 --> 01:20:57.691
but I found something bigger.

1908
01:20:59.317 --> 01:21:01.403
The real meaning of Christmas.

1909
01:21:03.113 --> 01:21:05.156
And I wanted to give you this.

1910
01:21:05.198 --> 01:21:06.741
You didn't have to.

1911
01:21:06.783 --> 01:21:09.744
It's nothing big. It's just
something I thought you'd like.

1912
01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:11.788
Okay. well.
should I open this now

1913
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:15.041
or do you want to open this
first?

1914
01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:16.626
Oh. my gosh.

1915
01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:18.003
Really?

1916
01:21:18.044 --> 01:21:19.587
You first.

[soft music]

1918
01:21:25.301 --> 01:21:27.595
It's my mom's patterns.

1919
01:21:29.514 --> 01:21:31.725
-How did you--
-Claire sent me a picture.

1920
01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:36.187
[Abigail] What is it?

1921
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:38.523
It's a. it's a case.

1922
01:21:39.357 --> 01:21:40.859
For your cell phone.

1923
01:21:41.693 --> 01:21:43.319
-It's engraved.
-"Call Bo."

Oh. exclamation mark.
I love it.

1925

Thank you.

1926

-Now it's your turn.
-Okay.

1928
01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:56.875
[Abigail] It's for the tree.

Our tree.

1930
01:22:01.671 --> 01:22:06.384
So I don't really know
how to tell you this. but.

1931
01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:11.389
What kind of a B and B
are you running here?

1932
