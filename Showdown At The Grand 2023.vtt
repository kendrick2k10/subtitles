00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.698
[Narrator] Ten years after the
collapse. society has crumbled.

5
00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:46.874
The future now a distant memory
of the past.

6
00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.428
The only commodity left
is violence.

7
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.844
here. in Necropolis.

Ice.

11
00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.141
No water. no ice.

12
00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.763
Tomato juice. though.

13
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.910
The best in all the land. Enjoy.

[greaser spits]

15
00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:04.917
What are you.
some sort of biker gang?

16
00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:07.748
Wannabe Hells Angels types?

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:10.682
[laughs]

18
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.926
More like a bunch of rejects
from Saturday morning cartoons.

19
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:17.309
Motorcycles are for poofs.

20
00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:18.655
We surf radio waves.

21
00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:20.657

22
00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.557

I'd like to thank you all.
for your support.

29
00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:39.451
Here at the Warner Grand.
we operate 365 days a year

between the hours of 12:15 p.m.

Lucky. my man!

36
00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:01.197
How's life treating you today?

37
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.303
[Lucky] Oh. Like it caught me in
bed with its wife again.

38
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:05.339
I know the feeling.

39
00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:07.514
[Lucky]
Gosh. that Hallyday.

40
00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:11.103
He's like a diamond
in a sea of glass. man.

41
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:12.312
Amen.

42
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.761
You know. I'd pay big bucks

43
00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.764
just to see him kick ass
and chew bubblegum again.

44
00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:18.732
You know. it's funny you should
mention that. brother.

45
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.597
I just got off the phone
with his team. you know?

46
00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:24.220
And Hallyday is going
to make an appearance

47
00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.326
at the old Warner Grand.

48
00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:29.398
Can you picture it?

49
00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:32.055
The man
who saved the world thrice!

50
00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.472
Killed Dracula twice!

51
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.577
Only got his heart broke
one time.

52
00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:37.992
[Lucky]
Oh!

53
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.133
Claude Luc Hallyday.

[door knocks]

57
00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.084
Come on. Have a seat.

58
00:06:03.604 --> 00:06:05.330
Apologies
about the air conditioning.

59
00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:06.711
Popped the fuse.

60
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.581
Yeah.
it says here you're a doctor?

61
00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.893
Yes. sir. A doctor of cinema.

62
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.068
[clears throat] And the theater
is my hospital.

63
00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:20.380
I wrote my dissertation

64
00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:22.623
on Western
imperialist pop culture

65
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:25.626
as a form of soft capitalism
in Taiwanese new wave.

66
00:06:25.764 --> 00:06:28.560
Like Bergman. Godard.
Tsai Ming-Liang.

67
00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:29.872
Those are films.

68
00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:36.016
This is the movie business.
It's the nitty gritty.

69
00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:40.192
You gotta make a dollar
from a nickel.

70
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.849
Yes. Um.

71
00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.749
a lowly servant protecting
the audience's suspension

72
00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:47.752
of disbelief at all costs.
24 frames per second.

73
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.443
See. you're saying
all the right things.

74
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:51.445
but there's more to it
than that.

75
00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:55.829
This is-- this is a marriage.
a sacrifice. you know.

76
00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:57.520
through thick and thin.

77
00:06:57.658 --> 00:07:00.592
Sometimes. you gotta forego
eating dinner

78
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.146
just to get
the concession stand filled.

79
00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:05.183
You know what I mean?

80
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.427
Now. how do I know
that when things get rough.

81
00:07:09.187 --> 00:07:11.776
you ain't gonna just slip out
on me?

82
00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:16.021
Well. 'cause I got nowhere else
to go.

83
00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:19.059
Only place
I feel like I mattered

84
00:07:19.197 --> 00:07:20.819
is when I walked
through those doors.

85
00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:25.721
Listen. sir. when I am in.
I am all in.

86
00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.483
You start today.

87
00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:30.967
Can I ask what my pay will be?

88
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:36.007
Well. I figured I'd start you
off as an intern

89
00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:39.562
and see how well you can swim
with the sharks.

90
00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.944
Welcome to the Warner Grand.

91
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:50.539

00:07:50.677 --> 00:07:51.816
Okay.
Thank you very much. Spike.

93
00:07:53.127 --> 00:07:55.336

94
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.855
Welcome. I'm George Fuller.

95
00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.654
My humblest apologies.
But let's get to it.

96
00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.276
Let me introduce you
to the Warner Grand.

97
00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:08.557
She was built in 1928
upon the Plaza's picturesque

98
00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:12.871
yet infamous courthouse square.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:17.289
It is to this day the longest.

United States of America.

101
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.711
Now. she opened
her theater doors

102
00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:29.923
to the showing of a German film
in 1928 called

103
00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:31.476
"Metropolis"

104
00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:33.858
which we recently
did a screening of

105
00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:36.654
in celebration
of her 90th birthday.

106
00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:42.142
Here is some
of the film industry's finest

107
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.318
artifacts of dismemberment
and pain.

108
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.047
Like this right here.

109
00:08:56.397 --> 00:08:59.090
The Axe of Escoffier

110
00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:01.023
from the 1984

111
00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:04.716

112
00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:08.444
Blood is for the Living.

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:11.654
femme fatale. Loco Moco.

114
00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:14.208
and the Force
From The North himself.

115
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.280
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday!

116
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.457
Now. if y'all
are Hallyday's fans.

117
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:24.011
I got something so special.
you will never see anything

118
00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:26.738
like this again
in a thousand galaxies.

119
00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:28.153
Hold on to your hats.
Come over here. y'all.

120
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.224
Come. this way.

121
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:31.950
Okay.

122
00:09:36.886 --> 00:09:39.924
The 1993 Gilera CX.

123
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.616
Now. underneath this plastic

124
00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:49.174
is 125 two CC two-stroke engine

125
00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:53.454
revving freely to 12.000 RPM
to blast you

126
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.284
into the stratosphere.

127
00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:57.079
Ciao bella!

128
00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:58.149
[George chuckles]

129
00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:01.393
Now. what makes this

130
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:05.190
really special is the fact
that this is the only

131
00:10:05.328 --> 00:10:08.608
hero vehicle to survive
the making

132
00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:10.817
of the Stephen Berkowitz

133
00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:14.614

134
00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:16.788
Necropolis.

135
00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:20.171
driven by none other
than the star himself.

136
00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:22.414
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday.

137
00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:24.554
Now. at the end of this month.
he's gonna do

138
00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:27.316
a special appearance
right here.

139
00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:28.420
Ain't that something?

140
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.423
All right. folks.

141
00:10:32.977 --> 00:10:35.393
Please be kind enough
to pick up all your items

142
00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:36.843
on the way out.

143
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:39.708
Don't forget to tip
old lovely Spike here.

144
00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:42.193
because like the Bible says.
man don't live

145
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.401
on hot dogs alone.

146
00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:44.851
[chuckles]

147
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:47.025
All right. This way. everyone.

148
00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:49.200
Thank you all so very much.

149
00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:51.167
Please come back.
Bring your families.

150
00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:52.444
Popcorn's on me.

151
00:10:56.794 --> 00:10:58.174
Hey. please don't touch my--

152
00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:00.383
Hi. How you doing?

153
00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:02.144
Oh. she told me a secret.

154
00:11:04.318 --> 00:11:06.182
See she lied to you
about her age.

155
00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:09.185
[scoffs]

156
00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:11.049
Excuse me?

157
00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:12.741
She was born in 1991.

158
00:11:13.983 --> 00:11:15.502
No. no. you're mistaken.

159
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.678
She was 1993.

160
00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.576
I saw it on the manifold
when I bought it.

161
00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:23.821
No. It was marketed until '93.

162
00:11:24.373 --> 00:11:26.478
It was only built for one year.
And that was in '91.

163
00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:29.550
Wow. [chuckles]

164
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.001
Well. you learn something new
every day. I guess.

165
00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:35.764
So. you fellas
a fan of the film?

166
00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:37.420
Always thought it was overrated.

167
00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:41.459
Can I take it for a spin?

168
00:11:41.597 --> 00:11:43.185
No. Please don't touch my bike.

169
00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:45.497
How much?

170
00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:48.569
I've never planned
on selling my bike.

171
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.778
Not the bike.

172
00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:51.503
The entire establishment.

173
00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:56.060
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

174
00:11:56.198 --> 00:11:58.303
Y'all-- y'all--
you fellas are pulling--

175
00:11:58.441 --> 00:11:59.442
pulling my leg.

176
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.512
This a prank or something?

177
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:05.863
[sighs] We've been trying
to get a hold of you.

178
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:07.312
You never returned our calls.
emails.

179
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.868
Hell. we even found
an old fax line. nada.

180
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:13.353

357
00:22:19.614 --> 00:22:23.480
"Terminate
with extreme prejudice."

358
00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:27.346
[exhales]

359
00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:29.555
[grunts] All right. Colonel.

360
00:22:29.693 --> 00:22:33.248
I think I might have gone
a little more Dirty Harry.

361
00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.939
You have to ask yourself
a question.

362
00:22:35.077 --> 00:22:37.528
"Do I feel Lucky?"

363
00:22:37.666 --> 00:22:40.324
"Well. do ya. punk?"

364
00:22:40.462 --> 00:22:42.706
[chuckles]

365
00:22:42.844 --> 00:22:44.397
"You are a disease."

366
00:22:46.054 --> 00:22:46.779
"and I'm the cure."

367
00:22:47.987 --> 00:22:49.713
[exhales]

368
00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:53.613
"I could've been a contender.
Charlie. Oh!"

369
00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:57.548
[both grunt. laugh]

370
00:22:58.687 --> 00:23:00.655
You know what? Um.

371
00:23:00.793 --> 00:23:02.657
do you mind if I borrow
your moral compass

372
00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:05.073
-just for a minute?
-Sure.

373
00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:06.488
Say somebody offered you

374
00:23:08.214 --> 00:23:11.562
more money than you thought
you'd ever see in a lifetime.

375
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.738
But one caveat.
you gotta say goodbye

376
00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:16.981
to the one thing that makes you
get up every morning.

377
00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:19.156
Mm.

378
00:23:19.294 --> 00:23:22.159
The one thing that makes fellas
like you and me tick. you know?

379
00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:24.713
What would you do?

380
00:23:26.922 --> 00:23:28.234
Not a chance in hell.

381
00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:31.410
I'd rather put a knife
through the heart of men

382
00:23:31.548 --> 00:23:33.101
who offered me
that kind of deal.

383
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.727
And this is it. Right now.
This is as good as it gets.

384
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.420
Thank you for that.

385
00:23:43.249 --> 00:23:44.768
All right. I'm out.

386
00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:46.217
Yeah. I'll catch you
in a little bit.

387
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:48.461
Wait a second.

388
00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:50.567
We forgot something. Don't go.

389
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.477
[George]
Oh my God. What's this?

390
00:24:05.754 --> 00:24:07.756
"The sword that fell
from the heavens

391
00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:10.897
and created hell on earth?"

392
00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:13.797
Hallyday's sword

393
00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:17.179
from Necropolis.

394
00:24:21.114 --> 00:24:22.253
Necropolis.

395
00:24:26.395 --> 00:24:27.983
How do you find these things?

396
00:24:28.121 --> 00:24:29.571
[Lucky]
These things are in the air.

397
00:24:29.709 --> 00:24:30.917
You just gotta know
how to grab stuff.

398
00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:35.266
It's yours.

399
00:24:39.374 --> 00:24:40.686
[laughs]

400
00:24:43.171 --> 00:24:45.276
If the Ten Commandments
won't stop him.

401
00:24:47.209 --> 00:24:49.867
these nine
full metal jackets will.

402
00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:51.282
[groans]

403
00:24:59.808 --> 00:25:01.879
[man 2 over projector] How will
we explain this to the Fuührer?

404
00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.709
-He's going to be furious.
-[laughs]

405
00:25:04.813 --> 00:25:06.056
[man 3 over projector]
The Jews will pay.

Call Dr. Mengele.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.549
[man 4 over projector]
Good idea.

413
00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:20.864
[George]
Sisters. I'm so sorry.

00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:26.179
Boss. we got a problem.

417
00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:27.526
Who?

418
00:25:27.664 --> 00:25:28.837
[Spike]
Health inspector.

419
00:25:28.975 --> 00:25:31.564
[indistinct chatter
in background]

420
00:25:32.082 --> 00:25:33.877
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
-Sir. please calm down.

421
00:25:34.015 --> 00:25:36.017
[George] What are you doing to
my stuff?

422
00:25:36.155 --> 00:25:37.743
[health inspector 1] We've been
sent by the city to
inspect your premises.

423
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:39.330
-Don't touch this.
-For mold. and termites.

424
00:25:39.468 --> 00:25:41.056
and bed bugs after reports of
vicious bite marks.

425
00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:42.851
What the hell? You were just
here six months ago.

426
00:25:42.989 --> 00:25:45.992
We didn't have a problem.
You're destroying places. man.

427
00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:50.928
Just turned it into trash.

428
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.938
Just like ain't nothing sacred
no more.

429
00:26:03.251 --> 00:26:05.805
[Lucky]
This is it. Right now.

430
00:26:05.943 --> 00:26:07.566
This is as good as it gets.

431
00:26:15.401 --> 00:26:18.438
I'd rather put a knife
in the heart of men

432
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.268
who offered me that kinda deal.

433
00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:39.149
[door knocks]

434
00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:42.186
You got mail. boss.

435
00:26:42.324 --> 00:26:44.154
Looks important.

436
00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:45.396
Never is.

437
00:26:47.122 --> 00:26:48.537
Sorry about yesterday.

438
00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:49.918
Um. the health inspector
was giving me

439
00:26:50.056 --> 00:26:52.956
the full
Peter Sellers' Clouseau act.

440
00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:54.923
Do you remember
in Pink Panther Strikes Again--

441
00:26:55.061 --> 00:26:56.684
Spike. Spike. do I look like

442
00:26:56.822 --> 00:26:59.410
I wanna talk
about movies right now?

443
00:26:59.548 --> 00:27:03.242
My theater is being shut down.
because of bed bugs.

444
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.108
Every penny I got. I put
into Hallyday coming here and...

445
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.388
[sighs] Do you-- you have
something for me. right?

446
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.052
[Lynn] Did
you reconsider my proposition?

447
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.985
I have a deadline to hit.

448
00:27:22.123 --> 00:27:25.333
George. I think it's time
you either play ball

449
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:26.437
or stay out of my way.

450
00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:32.064
[indistinct radio chatter]

451
00:27:32.202 --> 00:27:33.548
-[Burton] It's Hallyday.
-[Reed] Hallyday?

452
00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:35.136
[Burton]
Hallyday.

453
00:27:35.274 --> 00:27:36.447
Oh. there he is.

454
00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:42.005
[inhales. exhales]

455
00:27:44.386 --> 00:27:45.318
What are you doing?

456
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:46.975
Eating a burger.

457
00:27:47.113 --> 00:27:49.495
No. no. You're chasing it down
with the smoke.

458
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.014
It's delicious.

459
00:27:52.325 --> 00:27:54.327
[♪♪♪]

460
00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.467
[bell rings]

00:27:59.747 --> 00:28:01.403
[door buzzes]

462
00:28:01.541 --> 00:28:04.165
[indistinct chatter]

463
00:28:04.303 --> 00:28:05.684
Ooh.

464
00:28:05.822 --> 00:28:06.926
[Reed] This place is
disgusting.

465
00:28:07.064 --> 00:28:09.135
[Burton] Shh. Be nice.

466
00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:10.309
Only for you.

467
00:28:12.656 --> 00:28:14.416
Can I help you guys?

468
00:28:14.554 --> 00:28:16.764
Yep. Looking for a ring.

469
00:28:16.902 --> 00:28:18.731
Oh. Got a lot of rings right
here.

470
00:28:18.869 --> 00:28:21.389
See. mine was stolen.

471
00:28:22.528 --> 00:28:23.943
It's not worth a lot of money
to anybody else.

472
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:26.187
but personal sentiment.

473
00:28:26.325 --> 00:28:27.775
Mm.

474
00:28:27.913 --> 00:28:30.191
Well. all my stuff
is clean as glass.

475
00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:32.089
Sure it is.

476
00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:34.126
Yeah.

477
00:28:34.264 --> 00:28:36.473
Is there any identifiable
characteristics?

478
00:28:36.611 --> 00:28:39.579
Yeah. It was a 1990
Governor's Cup ring.

479
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.202
That's a minor-league baseball
championship.

480
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.859
It said. "Rochester"
on the side

481
00:28:42.997 --> 00:28:44.584
and it had a red stone
in the middle.

482
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.069
I think it was a garnet.

483
00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:48.002
Well. I can't replace
the sentimental value.

484
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:50.521
But if the shoe fits...

485
00:28:54.111 --> 00:28:55.906
-Ooh. look at that.
-There-- there you go.

486
00:28:59.082 --> 00:29:01.118
My first year in AAA.

487
00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:03.293
I was in the Oriole
organization.

488
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:07.642
And I went 6-1 with a 1.8 ERA. I
was hot shit.

489
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.920
Yeah. Well. you know what?

490
00:29:10.058 --> 00:29:11.819
Why don't you keep that ring?
It's on the house.

491
00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:13.510
It's very generous of you.

492
00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:18.066
But to make it in the show.
you need something special.

493
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:21.207
So. during the offseason.
I added a pitch to my arsenal.

494
00:29:22.312 --> 00:29:26.419
Cocaine!
Got my fastball up to 95.

495
00:29:26.557 --> 00:29:28.836
but my ERA tipped out
at nearly seven.

496
00:29:28.974 --> 00:29:30.803
I was crazy back then.

497
00:29:30.941 --> 00:29:33.047
-Yeah.
-I'm sober now.

498
00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:34.324
[scoffs]

499
00:29:34.462 --> 00:29:37.810
Well. congrats.
Yeah. I got seven years.

500
00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:39.087
God bless.

501
00:29:39.225 --> 00:29:41.296
You know what the kicker is?

502
00:29:41.434 --> 00:29:44.265
I hit 32 batters in one season
and it's not even a record.

503
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.027
Baseball is a tough sport.

504
00:29:49.408 --> 00:29:51.168
[Lucky groans] Oh. God! Oh.
fuck!

505
00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:52.618
Bang!

506
00:29:52.756 --> 00:29:54.171
-[grunts. groans]
-Zoom! Kaboom!

507
00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:56.380
[laughs]

508
00:29:56.518 --> 00:29:58.866
Consider this
an early retirement. old man.

509
00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:02.939
[laughs]

510
00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:14.571
Lucky. you're slipping. man.

511
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:15.952
Your door's wide--

512
00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:20.404
Shit.

513
00:30:20.542 --> 00:30:24.063
[indistinct lyrics]

514
00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:38.491
[Lucky groaning]

515
00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:40.977
Damn dingleberries. man!

516
00:30:42.737 --> 00:30:44.497
There you go. Golden Boy.

517
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:46.948
[Lucky]
Where'd you learn this trick?

518
00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:49.640
Courtney B. Vance.
Hamburger Hill.

519
00:30:51.332 --> 00:30:54.507
You think there's a chance
that that was them punks

520
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:57.096
that came to my theater?

521
00:30:57.234 --> 00:30:58.960
These weren't no punks. George.

522
00:30:59.098 --> 00:31:01.445
They made me sign
my shop over for pennies.

523
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:03.102
Everything I had.

524
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.416
They said they were coming back

525
00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:08.004
for Mr. Hollywood.

526
00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:13.078
I want you to know something.
Lucky.

527
00:31:15.218 --> 00:31:16.944
I'm going to avenge
what they did to you.

528
00:31:18.324 --> 00:31:21.224
I swear to you.
as long as there's blood

529
00:31:21.362 --> 00:31:25.193
in my veins. you've got a place
in my theater.

530
00:31:26.574 --> 00:31:29.232
You know what I said
to 'em before I rocked them?

531
00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:33.788
-[groans]

710
00:46:53.017 --> 00:46:54.812
You're-- you're Hallyday.

711
00:46:56.365 --> 00:46:58.367
May I be completely frank
for a moment?

712
00:47:00.024 --> 00:47:01.646
I'm really quite nervous.

713
00:47:01.784 --> 00:47:06.996
I haven't been around a crowd
this size for quite some time.

714
00:47:10.413 --> 00:47:11.621
Not since

715
00:47:13.727 --> 00:47:17.351
the croisette in '97 actually.

716
00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:19.422
Oh. Mr. Hallyday.

717
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.254
you need to know
those people in that audience.

718
00:47:23.392 --> 00:47:26.844
they're your fans.
and um. you're family to us.

719
00:47:29.018 --> 00:47:30.537
I had quite the hard
relationship

720
00:47:30.675 --> 00:47:31.641
with my family. though.

721
00:47:32.988 --> 00:47:34.955
[sighs]

722
00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:37.613
Yeah.
But this is the biggest thing

723
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:40.478
that's happened to any of us in
our entire lives.

724
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.516
I swear to you.
you are in-- in--

725
00:47:44.654 --> 00:47:45.863
in good hands. sir.

726
00:47:49.038 --> 00:47:52.662
Uh. okay. I trust you. George.

727
00:47:54.492 --> 00:47:55.700
Thank you.

728
00:47:55.838 --> 00:47:57.253
Thank you. sir.

729
00:47:57.391 --> 00:47:59.704
I'll be back in um--
with a five-minute warning.

730
00:47:59.842 --> 00:48:00.947
[Claude]
Thank you.

731
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:14.753
[indistinct chatter]

732
00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.238
Okay.

733
00:48:27.628 --> 00:48:31.149
Hello. everyone.
My name is George Fuller.

734
00:48:31.287 --> 00:48:35.222
I'm the proprietor
of this. uh. this picture house.

735
00:48:36.775 --> 00:48:39.123
Well. before we get started.
um...

736
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:48.787
...I'd like to share
with you all a quote.

737
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:51.411
It's from the trailblazing
godfather

738
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:54.932
of independent cinema himself.
Mr. Orson Welles.

739
00:48:56.416 --> 00:49:00.972
He stated that.
"If you want a happy ending.

740
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.183
it all depends
upon where you stop your story."

741
00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:10.602
I tell you we could stop
the story right now and

742
00:49:12.294 --> 00:49:14.261
I'd be as happy as a clam
at high tide.

743
00:49:16.332 --> 00:49:18.162
But enough of my jibber jabber.

744
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.198
For the main event.

745
00:49:20.336 --> 00:49:23.822
now. you have seen him
single-handedly

746
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:26.618
foil Nazi plots.

747
00:49:26.756 --> 00:49:29.138
delivered a pair
of conjoined twins

748
00:49:29.276 --> 00:49:31.278
in the Sahara Desert.

749
00:49:32.659 --> 00:49:37.043
He sent hordes of vampires
to their perilous demise.

750
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:40.839
And he is the very first

751
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:42.738
actor to copulate

752
00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:45.810
with a robot on film.

753
00:49:45.948 --> 00:49:50.263
The film Crude Circuitry
and the coming of an atomic age

754
00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:52.990
was one of the
most ground-breaking films

755
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:54.405
ever put together.

756
00:49:54.543 --> 00:49:56.821
Ladies and gentlemen.

757
00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:01.412
let's welcome the Force
From The North himself.

758
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.691
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday!

759
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:08.419
[audience cheering]

760
00:50:11.629 --> 00:50:13.389
Hell. yeah!

761
00:50:23.606 --> 00:50:24.262
Hello.

762
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.541
[groans softly. sighs]

763
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.510
Apologies. I--

764
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.306
I don't really get out
much anymore.

765
00:50:33.444 --> 00:50:36.240
So. I'm a little rusty.

766
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.763
I try to stay in locales
with air indexes below 10.

767
00:50:42.901 --> 00:50:45.214
Estonia mostly these days.

768
00:50:45.352 --> 00:50:47.320
Well. not just for

769
00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:49.425
the affordable
high level of oxygen.

770
00:50:49.563 --> 00:50:53.188
but for the plethora of saunas.

771
00:50:54.465 --> 00:50:57.261
Many people feel the sauna
was invented

772
00:50:57.399 --> 00:50:58.331
in neighboring Finland.

773
00:50:58.469 --> 00:51:01.748
No. it was actually in Estonia.

774
00:51:01.886 --> 00:51:04.751
where that word was first used.

775
00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:07.443
Well. roughly around 2.000 B.C.

776
00:51:11.723 --> 00:51:13.691

he wasn't a tough guy.

00:51:42.133 --> 00:51:44.066
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday.
everybody!

782
00:51:44.204 --> 00:51:45.205
He's still got it.

You're late.

788
00:52:23.519 --> 00:52:26.212
You should get yourself
a decent watch next time.

789
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:28.145
[Cyberella]
Play nice.

790
00:52:28.283 --> 00:52:29.249
[Well-dressed man]
Nice. why?

791
00:52:31.286 --> 00:52:34.461
He ain't nothing but a bunch
of scrap metal put together.

792
00:52:37.015 --> 00:52:38.810
I'm here for the 100 gig.

793
00:52:38.948 --> 00:52:40.226
RAM upgrade.

794
00:52:40.364 --> 00:52:41.951
What am I running here? A zoo?

795
00:52:43.539 --> 00:52:45.645
How do I know
you ain't a cop. boy?

796
00:52:45.783 --> 00:52:47.060
Oink. Oink.

797
00:52:47.198 --> 00:52:48.406
Well...

798
00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:51.582
...check it out.

799
00:52:58.416 --> 00:52:59.555
Look at that.

800
00:53:02.972 --> 00:53:04.215
Ooh.

802
00:53:16.607 --> 00:53:19.057
[Well-dressed man]
Damn!

803
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:21.922
You got yourself a deal. chico.

804
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.303
Enjoy your upgrade.

00:53:39.354 --> 00:53:40.320
Wait.

807
00:53:41.563 --> 00:53:42.805
Where did you find this?

808
00:53:42.943 --> 00:53:47.258
[sighs] I found that at an
estate sale

809
00:53:47.396 --> 00:53:48.915
from the armorer himself.

810
00:53:49.053 --> 00:53:52.332
Oh. Tristano.

811
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.334
Yeah.

812
00:53:54.472 --> 00:53:56.785
One of the few men
I called a friend.

813
00:53:56.923 --> 00:53:59.236
Supposedly. he found
this fossilized

814
00:53:59.374 --> 00:54:00.720
in the cave of Altamira.

815
00:54:01.997 --> 00:54:03.309
Wait.

816
00:54:03.447 --> 00:54:06.243
The Axe of Escoffier
was found in a-- a cave?

817
00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:09.246
-It's real?
-Correction.

818
00:54:09.384 --> 00:54:11.248
It's not an axe.
This is a halberd.

819
00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:15.528
See the inscription here?

820
00:54:20.947 --> 00:54:24.606
"I naur -o I coe.

821

Im tur- feel ha in nin loins."

822
00:54:27.747 --> 00:54:30.991
It means the fire of the earth.

823
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.787
I feel it in my loins.

824
00:54:33.925 --> 00:54:35.479
My God!

825
00:54:39.206 --> 00:54:41.692
Wow. Is this...

826
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.387
Damn right. it is. Iraqnophobia.

827
00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:51.046
I lost all the hairs on my ass

828
00:54:51.184 --> 00:54:53.635
when that flame thrower stunt
went south in that picture.

00:54:54.946 --> 00:54:59.882
Straight through my pants.
[chuckles]

831
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.333
We didn't fake war on that one.
Huh?

832
00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:04.508
Gaspar threw us smack dab
in the middle

833
00:55:04.646 --> 00:55:06.993
of the Indonesian Revolution
against Sukarno.

834
00:55:07.131 --> 00:55:08.339

the opening monologue you gave
to the-- to the infantry.

838
00:55:29.187 --> 00:55:30.810
Oh. yeah. To the infantry.

asked by masters of war
to play protectors of the realm.

Asked to act as if we love
the smell of blood

846

and embrace death
like our own mother's bosom.

847
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.182
But the house
is betting against us.

848
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.841
that we will die here
in this prison of sand and oil.

Not today. I say.

Not today.

851
00:56:06.639 --> 00:56:09.158
We will live to see
the sunrise over Baghdad.

852

And this time next year.

00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:14.509
I shall be back
for the harvest. Mom.

I can't wait to see your face.

itself.
