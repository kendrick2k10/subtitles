00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:07.067
GRANDMAMAH:
The ocean
is a mysterious world.

8
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:11.139
One that land dwellers
can only begin to imagine.

9
00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:14.908
Of course. you think you know
what lies beneath the surface.

10
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:16.944
Ah. but the sea creatures
who live there.

11
00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:20.281
well. even the ones
you have imagined.

12
00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.950
you've imagined them wrong.

13
00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.554
Take the mythical.
mighty giant kraken.

14
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.955
Bloodthirsty monster.

15
00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.491
sinker of ships.
drowner of sailors.

16
00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:31.925
(laughing)

17
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.761
That's what you people think.

18
00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:39.133
You see. in real life.
krakens are noble protectors.

19
00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:42.303
The sea will always need
a kraken.

20
00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:47.441
and a kraken will always
answer the call.

21
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.810
(quacking ringtone)

22
00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.778
* We can take turns...

23
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:51.779
GIRL:
Ruby-doo.

24
00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:52.946
Hey. Margot.

25
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.182
MARGOT:
I am dying of suspense.

26
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.616
-(yawns)
-What did your mom say?

27
00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.318
Well. I chickened out
last night.

28
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.520
but I'm going to ask her now.
right now. this second.

29
00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.155
MARGOT: Did you do
the confidence-building

30
00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.356
exercise I taught you?

31
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.124
RUBY:
I did something even better.

32
00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:07.295
* We'll never cave
or we'll never waver *

33
00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.497
*

34
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.034
* And we'll always become
braver and braver *

35
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.037
* We'll dance
like nobody's there *

36
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.173
* We'll dance
without any cares *

37
00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:21.008
* We'll talk 'bout problems
we share *

38
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.810
* We'll talk 'bout things
that ain't fair *

39
00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:24.212
* We'll sing 'bout things
we don't know *

40
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:25.979
* We'll sing to people
and show *

41
00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:27.848
* What it means to be young

42
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.617
* And growing up.

44
00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:33.221
Oh. hey. (clears throat)

45
00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:37.024
Junior prom is the sacred rite
of every human teenager.

46
00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.159
As a kraken who is barely
pulling off

47
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:40.628
this whole human thing.

48
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.531
I need to be there
so that I can blend in.

49
00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.233
And. as a proud mathlete.

50
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.067
I know that to find
a potential solution.

51
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.002
I have to evaluate the problem.

52
00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.471
Now. I know the rules.

53
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.806
Our family is not allowed
in the ocean. ever.

54
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.074
For any reason.

55
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.676
And I love rules.

56
00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.211
I do. I really. really do.

57
00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.381
But the prom boat
is on the water.

58
00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:02.049
-not in the water.
-(thunder crashing)

59
00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:04.385
"What if there's a storm?"
you might ask.

60
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:06.053
Well. I've analyzed
weather trend data.

61
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.489
and my trusty friend.
the Internet.

62
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.359
has assured me that it will be
smooth sailing on prom night.

63
00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:15.663
And lastly. this is the captain
of said prom boat.

64
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.265
Look into those eyes.

65
00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:19.233
Tell me he hasn't seen it all.

66
00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.569
I trust him with my life.
and so should you.

67
00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:24.071
And that is why I.
Ruby Gillman.

68
00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:25.739
should go to prom. Thank you.

69
00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:28.576
Please. please. please.
please. please!

70
00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.110
Strong presentation.

71
00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.845
I like the energy.
but it's still a no. honey.

72
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.782
But. Mom. evidence.
science. Internet.

73
00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:37.251
Trust me. Ruby.
I know what's best for you.

74
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:39.553
And what's best
is to always stay on land.

75
00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:40.554
That's why we moved here.

76
00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:42.022
It's much safer for us.

77
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.724
Sorry. Tadpole. Mom's right.

78
00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.759
MOM:
Sam. breakfast!

79
00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:48.296
Hey. didn't you say
that prom was a postbolognal...

80
00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.364
Postcolonial
patriarchal construct. It is.

81
00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:52.065
But we would go as a group.

82
00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.301
As a form of protest.

83
00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.436
Wow. So brave.

84
00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.938
What do you think?
I had these printed
for my big launch party.

85
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.640
I think I'm in love.

86
00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.443
-Blech.
-Do you still
need me to be there?

87
00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.777
Yes. This is a make-or-break
moment.

88
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.646
I'm selling
an entire development.

89
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.714
But. Mom. you're...

90
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:07.715
Agatha Gillman.

91
00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.483
and I slay the competition.

92
00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:12.019
She got us our dream home.
and I'm not asking how.

93
00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.823
Well. I just want
to show potential buyers

94
00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.292
what a happy Oceanside family
looks like.

95
00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:21.228
I'll be closing my shop for
the day so I can man the grill.

96
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.331
From chill man to grill man.

97
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.565
(groans)

98
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.899
Ooh. Arthur.
you should think about

99
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.635
hiring someone to help you.

100
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.470
Business has been booming
since you started Bottled Up.

101
00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:30.671
Hey there.

102
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.440
Welcome back to Bottled Up.

103
00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:35.709
Now. let's hoist those sails.

104
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.512
Magic.

105
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.249
Wow. you two are quite
the power couple.

106
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.184
You think that's great?

107
00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.487
You're looking at
the undefeated dodgeball champ.

108
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.389
-(whistle blowing)
-*

109
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.924
-(Sam laughing)
-(kids grunting)

110
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.093
He's a legend. Ooh.

111
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.363
Yeah. yeah.
You guys are all crushing it.

112
00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:57.264
Oh. Ruby.
don't sell yourself short.

113
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.699
You're amazing at math.

114
00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.701
I am the reason
Connor's passing algebra.

115
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:01.969
SAM:
Oh. Connor.

116
00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.771
-So dreamy.
-Sam.

117
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.373
Ow. You're the one
in love with him.

118
00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:07.307
-Hey. hey. Stop.
You each landed one.
-(groans)

119
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.543
Marine Biologist Quarterly?

120
00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:11.845
Oh. Ruby.
You're still reading this trash?

121
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.181
Humans don't know everything
about the ocean.

122
00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.683
Mom. there's a whole world
down there

123
00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:16.984
that I have never seen.

124
00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:18.819
Jellyfish. plankton.
coral reefs...

125
00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.954
But what else lives there?

126
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:22.556
I know. Monsters.

127
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.192
And those monsters
want to hurt krakens like us.

128
00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:27.961
This is where we belong.
Oceanside is our home.

129
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.798
Then help me fit in
by letting me go to prom.

130
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.166
Ruby. the answer is no.

131
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.201
(squeaking)

132
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:35.669
-Time to go.
-(Ruby groans)

133
00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:37.070
-Mom.
-Gillman dishes to Gillman.

134
00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.639
The fadeaway at the buzzer.

135
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.673
-and it's good!
-Yeah.

136
00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:40.674
Woo-hoo!

137
00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:41.909
Limb up. everyone.

138
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:44.011
Let's all have
a very human day.

139
00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.880
Does it bother you guys that we
lie to everyone all the time?

140
00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:49.817
Oh. we're not lying.
We're just omitting.

141
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.918
Yeah. okay.

142
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.420
And remember...

143
00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:54.922
OTHERS: If anyone asks.
we're from Canada.

144
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.024

145
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.929
(boat horns blowing)

146
00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:05.533
-(screams)
-(tires screeching)

147
00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:07.267
-(people exclaiming)
-Whoa. what's happening?

148
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.202
-Are we supposed to be stopped?
-Is our tour over?

149
00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:12.406
Apologies for the unplanned
interruption. folks.

150
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.676
Well. look what the tide
dragged in. Davey.

151
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.412
Ahoy. Mr.--
Captain Gordon Lighthouse. sir.

152
00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:20.080
Aren't you one
of them Gillmans?

153
00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.114
Guilty.

154
00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.516
(laughs nervously)

155
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.552
Just kidding. Not guilty.
Totally normal.

156
00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:27.521
-Is she blue?
-I'm from Canada... eh.

157
00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:30.023
("O Canada" playing)

158
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.091
-Oh...
-(tourists murmuring)

159
00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.460
That totally makes sense.

160
00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:35.696
I've got my eye on you.
Gillman girl.

161
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.397
And my other eye. too!

162
00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.902
(over speaker): Our tour begins
where 15 years ago.

163
00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:45.639
I swear I saw the monstrous
giant kraken.

164
00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.108
And to your right. Oceanside's
best saltwater taffy.

165
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.544
-Ask for the Gordon Lighthouse
discount.
-(quacking ringtone)

166
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:52.245
Hey. guys.

167
00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.214
-Yo. -Greetings.
-So. how did it go?

168
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.249
Yes. I'm dying to find out.

169
00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:58.619
Same. I've been stress-gaming.

170
00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:00.821
Well. it's official.
Mom won't let me go to prom.

171
00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.490
And I know it's not
what we wanted.

172
00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.758
but we still have plan B.

173
00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.094
our very cool anti-prom party.

174
00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:09.897
And what is the most
liberated food out there?

175
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.932
Guys. I'm talking fondue.

176
00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.737
Ruby. um. I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

177
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.472
Kayla asked me to the prom.

178
00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:20.608
-Oh.
-And. uh.

179
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:21.942
I said carpe diem. (giggling)

180
00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:23.243
Aka. I said yes.

181
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.812
-What?
-I said yes.

182
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:28.148
No. I got that. Loud and clear.

183
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.186
RUBY:
Okay. Margot has torn our hearts

184
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.655
into a million tiny pieces.

185
00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.123
and that's fine.

186
00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.858
More fondue for the rest of us.
right. guys?

187
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.359
BLISS:
Yeah. uh.

188
00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.194
once Margot was going
with Kayla.

189
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.463
Trevin said. "Oh. well.
should we just go together?"

190
00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:45.198
And I agreed.

191
00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.601
So Trevin and I are going
to the prom together.

192
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.036
As friends.

193
00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.638
(laughs nervously):
Yeah. only as friends.

194
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.105
-(clears throat)
-RUBY: What?

195
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.106
What?

196
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.374
Sorry. Ruby.

197
00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.043
We promised to always
stick together.

198
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:59.012
Does squad solidarity
mean nothing to you?

199
00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.848
Well. of course it does.

200
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.116
Which is why
you should come with us.
You'll be on a boat.

201
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.618
You'll be completely safe.

202
00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:06.520
Unless there's
a tragic accident.

203
00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:09.022
-Bliss. no catastrophizing.
-Sorry.

204
00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:12.292
You guys know my mom.
and that is why we made plan B.

205
00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.361
Margot. just bring Kayla
to our anti-prom party.

206
00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:15.996
We will watch bad movies.

207
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.297
We'll dip Swiss.

208
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.465
Enough with the fondue!

209
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.168
We eat a lot of cheese.

210
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.636
Wheels of it.

211
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.337
Think about how many events
we've missed

212
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.006
in squad solidarity

213
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.508
because of your mom's
irrational anti-ocean rule.

214
00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.177
I guess a few.

215
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.379
What? There was the field trip
to the submarine museum.

216
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.081
The school beach day.

217
00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:35.883
-All-county surf contest.
-TREVIN: The Grunion Fun Run.

218
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.417
MARGOT: The Oceanside
Festival of the Bard.

219
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.819
BLISS: My grandmother's
beach birthday party.

220
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.220
MARGOT:
Kayla's beach birthday party!

221
00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.655
TREVIN:
Any birthday party but Bliss's.

222
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:42.856
You're always welcome
at the graveyard.

223
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.425
But this isn't just any party.

224
00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.194
This is prom.

225
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:49.096
And I really want
to be a part of it.

226
00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.198
We all do.

227
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.866
Yeah. No. I get it.

228
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.401
You guys should go without me.

229
00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.403
It's one thing for my mom
to ruin my life.

230
00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:57.938
She doesn't have to ruin yours.

231
00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:00.173
Uh. what if you don't tell her?

232
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.842
Gasp of exclamation!

233
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.844
Trevin's right.
Your mom doesn't have to know.

234
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.913
Deception. I'm on board.

235
00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.247
Come on. Ruby. Do it.

236
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.582
Do it.

237
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:11.051
I want to.
but if my mom finds out. uh...

238
00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:13.120
Oh. life is not
a dress rehearsal.

239
00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:18.258
It's time for you to go big
and go to prom.

240
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.526
Okay. Okay. okay. okay.

241
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.729
(sighs)
You're right.

242
00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.563
Okay. I'll do it.

243
00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:25.833
-I'll go to prom.
-Yes!

244
00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.036
And I'm gonna ask Connor.

245
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.604
Connor?

246
00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:32.072
Okay. that's a...
that's a big swing there.

247
00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:33.907
Whoo. But we are here for it.

248
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:36.944
Step one. you're going
to need a prom-posal.

249
00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:38.946
Blue-sky with me. people.
Any ideas?

250
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:40.748
Maybe I can ask him with
something epic.

251
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.583
like an advanced
quadratic equation.

252
00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:47.120
And when I solve it.
the answer is...

253
00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:48.488
prom.

254
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.394
Ruby. my sweet. wide-eyed.
dumbest smart person ever.

255
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.230
you cannot ask Connor to prom
with homework.

256
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.466
But look how it graphs.
It's cool.

257
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.734
It is not cool.

258
00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.970
A good prom-posal is art.

259
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:04.571
Showmanship is the name
of the game

260
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.107
in this hormone-fueled
benchmark of adolescence.

261
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.009
A ritual that embodies
the ultimate

262
00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.178
in high risk. high reward.

263
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:13.580
-*
-Now. you get one shot at prom

264
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.450
and one shot at persuading your
Romeo that you are his Juliet.

265
00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:21.121
With stakes this high.
the only option is to go big.

266
00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:23.957
MAN (over P.A.): Everyone.
don't forget to RSVP for prom.

267
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.794
the most important day
of your lives.

268
00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:29.129
I almost asked Connor to prom
with homework.

269
00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:30.864
We got you. Ruby.
There are so many other options.

270
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.834
Here. this is the first draft.
but with this script

271
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.969
and my favorite prop
from clown school...

272
00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:38.105
Mm. I don't know. Do you have
something a little smaller?

273
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.974
Tone down the drama. you say?

274
00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:42.375
-I know just the thing.
-What's that?

275
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.444
A commercial-grade
DJ confetti cannon.

276
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.314
You just ask Connor to prom.
push this button.

277
00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.483
and the confetti will rain down
like closing night on Broadway.

278
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.686
Uh. maybe I abandon this whole

279
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.855
"ask your dream guy
to prom" thing.

280
00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:56.857
("Hello" by Calabasas playing)

281
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.358
(gasps)

282
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.629
* I really. really wanna get
to know ya *

283
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.864
Connor.

284
00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.866
* Hello. hello

285
00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.136
* I really. really wanna get
to know ya *

286
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.838
* Hello. hello...

287
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:13.006
Connor. would you do me
the honor

288
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.008
of going to human prom with me?

289
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.244
Oh. Ruby. yes.

290
00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:21.414
Oh. you've made me the happiest
guy on dry land. Ruby.

291
00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:23.751
-Connor.
-Ruby.

292
00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.853
-Ruby?
-(song slows. stops)

293
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:28.889
Hi.

294
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.523
Connor's here.

295
00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:33.293
Uh. yeah. Connor's here.

296
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:37.230
Oh! Oh. Hi. Hi. hi. hi.

297
00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:38.866
(laughs):
Uh...

298
00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.401
we're still on for our tutoring
sesh later. right?

299
00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.770
Oh. (laughs)

300
00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:46.006
Oh. yeah. Connor.
We are on like polygons.

301
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.341
(laughs):
All right. Team math.

302
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.843
I'll see you later.

303
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:52.279
You know it.
Anything for my alge-bae.

304
00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:54.181
-Your what now?
-I mean bro.

305
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.749
A-Alge-bro.

306
00:11:55.783 --> 00:11:57.050
Like you're my brother.

307
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.385
You're my math brother.

308
00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:02.923
You know. I think I liked
the first one better.

309
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.097
Give me that confetti cannon.

310
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.598
Yes!

311
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:13.300
-(hyperventilating)
-CONNOR: You gotta practice.

312
00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.235
The trick is to reject
the concept of gravity.

313
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:17.070
It doesn't exist.
It's not real.

314
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:18.405
BOY:
All right. Peace out.

315
00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:20.273
CONNOR:
Yo. hit me up later.

316
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.145
-Hey. Connor.
-Hey. Ruby.

317
00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.313
What's up?

318
00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.248
Um. hey.

319
00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:31.318
So. I was wondering.

320
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:32.953
did you see. like.
all those prom-posals

321
00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:34.421
around school this morning?

322
00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:36.156
-Yes.
-Hmm.

323
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:37.657
They kind of weird me out.

324
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.126
Just ask someone.

325
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:41.829
It doesn't have to be
this big proposal.

326
00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.130
It's crazy. right?

327
00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:45.833
Oh. yeah. I hear that.

328
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:48.468
And besides.
prom is a postcolonial

329
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.170
-patriarchal construct.
-Patriarchal construct.

330
00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:51.271
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

331
00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:52.539
(both chuckling)

332
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:58.211
It could be fun to go
with the right person. though.

333
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.514
Oh. (laughs nervously)

334
00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.483
Yeah. Totally.

335
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.019
(clears throat)

336
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.420
-Ruby... Oh.
-Connor... Oh. sorry.

337
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.656
-Ruby... Oh. hey.
-Connor... Oh. you go.

338
00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:11.324
-(laughing): No. you go.
-No. You go.

339
00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:13.293
Yeah. no. you go. I go.

340
00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:16.429
Wait. Okay. no. But seriously.
what-what did you want to say?

341
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.967
Um. Connor. I...

342
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.634
I...

343
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:24.204
-...think I'm gonna be sick.
-Whoa.

344
00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:25.672
Hey. Are-are you okay?

345
00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.474
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

346
00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:29.476
I get seasick sometimes
when I'm next to the ocean.

347
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:31.111
It's genetic.

348
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.812
You know. my sisters do this
grounding technique thing.

349
00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:35.282
Ooh. Whoops. Wait. what's this?

350
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.184
-Hah. Oh. That?
Never seen that before.
-Whoa.

351
00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.552
-Is this a kaleidoscope?
-Maybe put it down. -(beeps)

352
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:41.554
-(gasps)
-CANNON: It's party time!

353
00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:43.656
(multiple booming)

354
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.058
-(Ruby screaming)
-(yelling)

355
00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.393
(screaming)

356
00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.494
-Connor!
-(splashing)

357
00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:49.129
Connor. are you okay?

358
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.031
*

359
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:55.835
Connor. grab this!

360
00:13:57.237 --> 00:13:58.872
Son of an anglerfish!

361
00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.542
*

362
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.712
(whimpers)
Connor!

363
00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:07.948
(hyperventilating)

364
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.851
Okay. Okay. Okay. okay.
okay. okay. okay.

365
00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:13.887
(screaming)

366
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.956

372
00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.992
(panting)

373
00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:28.395
(coughing)

374
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.897
(sighs) What just happened?

375
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.732
(breathing heavily)

376
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.834
(gasps)
Connor.

377
00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:37.804
(crowd clamoring)

378
00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:39.739
-GIRL: The new girl
saved Connor.
-Connor?

379
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:40.807
-GIRL 2: She's a hero.
-Connor.

380
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.175
Ruby. there you are.

381
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:43.776
You missed the story
of the year. girl.

382
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.512
-Connor almost drowned.
-RUBY: I didn't mean to.

383
00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:46.980
I mean I-I didn't do it.

384
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.515
(laughs nervously):
Gosh. that's crazy.

385
00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:50.317
And surprising.

386
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.352
Because it definitely didn't
have anything to do with me.

387
00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:54.021
Are you feeling all right?

388
00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.788
-Why are you wet?
-(gasps)

389
00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:59.192
(low crowd chatter)

390
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.960
-Connor. Are you okay?
-(coughing)

391
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.662
Yeah. It was crazy.

392
00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:06.266
I just remember there was smoke
and glitter.

393
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.301
And then the next thing I knew.

394
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.770
I was saved by the new girl.

395
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.205
The new girl?

396
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.206
-*
-(crowd cheering)

397
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.907
The new girl.

398
00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.711
-Thank you. Thank you.
-BOY: Whoo!

399
00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:19.846
New girl.

400
00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:21.281
She's going to say something.

401
00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.150
-GIRL: Shh. -(crowd quiets)
-Picture this.

402
00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:25.785
me. stunning but approachable.

403
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.121
-on my first day of school.
-(giggling)

404
00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.522
I'm lost and confused.

405
00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.824
struggling to find
my first class.

406
00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:33.493
When suddenly-- (gasps)--

407
00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:36.696
I spot little mister skater boy
here barely above water.

408
00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.731
-I'm just lucky that...
-Oh.

409
00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:40.667
Shush. shush. Ooh. My story.

410
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.371
Now. I'm not much of a swimmer.
but in that moment.

411
00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:47.674
I remembered what my mother
always told me:

412
00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:49.642
"You are gorgeous."

413
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.245
Also. "Big risk. big reward.

414
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:54.381
Always go big."

415
00:16:54.414 --> 00:16:59.319
And what is bigger
than saving a life?

416
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.887
(cheering)

417
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.022
Yes. queen. Get it.

418
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.824
I love you so much.

419
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.593
Love you. too. rando.

420
00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:08.428
She pointed at me. I'm Rando.

421
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:13.266
Oh. no. What's happening?

422
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.434
-Watch it.
-Ah. Excuse me.

423
00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:16.203
Wait.

424
00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.604
We haven't met.

425
00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:20.407
I'm Chelsea.
Chelsea Van Der Zee.

426
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.376
-It's Dutch. Kusjes!
-GIRL: So exotic.

427
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.511
GIRL 2:
I love you.

428
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.279
-And you are?
-I'm. um...

429
00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:27.680
I'm Ruby Gillman.

430
00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.749
It's Canadian... eh.

431
00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:32.252
Okay. maybe it's the whole
"don't look at me" vibe.

432
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.287
but there's something different
about you.

433
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:36.723
I-I really gotta go now.

434
00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:43.796
-BOY: Uh. are you good?
-BOY 2: What's wrong with her?

435
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.798
BOY 3: Yeah. you might need
to lie down for a little bit.

436
00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:47.100
BOY 2: Yeah. that's awkward.

437
00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:48.801
GIRL:
What's her deal?

438
00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:50.403
Is she gonna barf?

439
00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.439
-Freaking out.
-(whimpering)

440
00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:54.073
Are you okay?

441
00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:55.908
You really look like
you've been through something.

442
00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:58.811
Yeah. I really got to go. Now.

443
00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:01.314
MAN (over P.A.):
All right. everyone.

444
00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:04.417
Show's over.
Let's get back to class.

445
00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:06.486
(Ruby whimpering)

446
00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:14.294
*

447
00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.129
Welcome to your new home.

448
00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:17.464
if I may be so bold.

449
00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:19.065
-Ooh.
-This is incredible.

450
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.967
Oh. you've picked a great place
to raise a kid.

451
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.902
It's so safe here in Oceanside.

452
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:26.639
Moving my family here was
the best decision I ever made.

453
00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:29.008
Doug actually grew up here.

454
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.578
We're moving back so that
we can be closer to his folks
when the little one comes.

455
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.246
Hello. free babysitting.

456
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.481
(laughs nervously)

457
00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:35.848
How nice.

458
00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:37.517
Just be careful
they don't tell you

459
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.852
how you should live your life
and raise your children.

460
00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:42.955
I mean. it'll be so nice
to have family nearby.

461
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:45.024
You're very lucky.
(chuckles)

462

468
00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:00.640
Oh. why am I glowing?

469
00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:01.941
Glowing is not good.

470
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.510
I will never go into
the ocean again.

471
00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:05.044
Lesson learned.

472
00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.446
Call Mom.

473
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.847
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Video call Connor.

474
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.949
What? I didn't say that.
Call Mom.

475
00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.050
-Ruby. where'd you go?
-(yelps)

476
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.485
-Whoa. Hey.
-(Connor coughing)

477
00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:14.487
(whispering):
End call. end call. end call.

478
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:15.655
-Wait. I wanted
to ask you some...
-I'm going through a tunnel.

479
00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.023
Call Mom.

480
00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:18.658
-(phone beeps)
-No. I can't call Mom.

481
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.159
She's gonna kill me.

482
00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:22.929
-Mm? (yelping)
-(squishing)

483
00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.633
There's three of them?
(groans)

484
00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.236
Oh. this is a nightmare.

485
00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:32.305

486
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.640
No!

489

You're a long way from home.

493

A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

WOMAN:
Do you see that?

506
00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:33.232
-(gasps) Kraken!
-What is that?

507
00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:35.067
-Kraken ahoy! She's back!
-Oh. my goodness.

508
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.936
Oh. she's coming for me.

-Oh. Look at this view.
-DOUG: Wow.

519

Holy migoli. this is amazing.

520
00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.574
What do you think. boo?

521
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.444
I think... we're sold!

Oh. Fantastic.

523
00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.347
Well. I'll get
the paperwork started.

524
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.948
and we'll make this quick
and easy

525
00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:23.616
so you can focus
on your little one.

526
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.084
-I can't believe this is ours.
-Look at this house.

-This is beautiful.
-Honey. you were saying

528
00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:29.088
you wanted a built-in grill.
and that is built-in.

529
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.090
Oh. man. I get
to be grillmaster again.

530
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.325
(laughs nervously)

531
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.693
You make sure you enjoy

532
00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:35.362
every minute of quiet
you have left

533
00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.029
because once the baby comes.
it is going to blow up

534
00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.065
-your whole life.
-Okay. Okay.

535
00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.501
(tires screeching)

536
00:21:41.534 --> 00:21:43.169
Look around.
Get a feel for the place.

537
00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:45.271
Just leave the key in
the lockbox when you're done.

538
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.639
Or-or keep it. (laughs)

539
00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:48.541
Whatever. Talk soon.

540
00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:52.945
AGATHA (sighs):
Pick up. Ruby. Pick up.

541
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.314
-(line ringing)
-Oh. pick up. Ruby. Pick up!

542
00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:56.649
(sighs)
Okay.

543
00:21:56.683 --> 00:21:58.951
Agatha. you can figure this out.

544
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.820
Everything is gonna be fine.

545
00:22:00.853 --> 00:22:03.155
-(thudding)
-(yelps) Son of an anglerfish!

546
00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:04.857
-(gasps)
-(tires screeching)

547
00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:10.797
(whimpers) It's probably
just a traffic cone.

548
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.200
(gasps)
Oh. no.

549
00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:16.636
*

550
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:18.104
Hello?

551
00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:30.316
(jabbering)
Heya. sis.

552
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:34.253
Good old Uncle Brill's here
to see his favorite niece Ruby.

553
00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:36.022
-What? Brill?
-Heya.

554
00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:38.324
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. (grunts)

555
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.892
Why wouldn't I be?

556
00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:41.494
I just hit you with a car.

557
00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:43.229
How do you guys deal with
the gravity here on land?

558
00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:44.864
It's crazy. right?
(laughing)

559
00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:47.534
Anyway. I came
to say congratulations.

560
00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:49.869
Ruby's all grown-up
and turned into a giant...

561
00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:52.338
Shh. shh. shh. Not so loud.

562
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.873
-Come on.
-Whoa.

563
00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.074
I see you still got that
upper body strength. huh?

564
00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.877
-(grunting)
-Ow. Oof.

565
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.879
(tires squealing)

566
00:22:59.912 --> 00:23:02.048
("Oh!" by The Linda Lindas
playing)

567
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.550
-* Oh. when I say something
-(crunching)

568
00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:05.084
-Ow!
-* I wish I had shut up

569
00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:06.719
Are you kidding me?

570
00:23:06.753 --> 00:23:08.755
-* I always screw things up
-* Oh!

571
00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:09.889
* The places that feel right

572
00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:11.390
* They never last too long

573
00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:13.125
* And when I think of things

574
00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:14.761
-(heavy footsteps)
-* They always turn out wrong

575
00:23:14.794 --> 00:23:16.896
* Wrong. wrong. wrong.
wrong... *

576
00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:18.397
What are you doing here. Brill?

577
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:19.398
We felt the pulse.

578
00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:21.400
So Mom knows?

579
00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:22.702
Uh. yeah.

580
00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:24.604
-She sent me to get Ruby.
-(groans)

581
00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:27.440
This is exactly why she wasn't
supposed to go into the ocean.

582
00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:29.108
Uh. then why would you
live next to it?

583
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.810
-We needed to stay moist.
-Ew. Moist.

584
00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:32.545
-Where is she? Where is she?
-(heavy footsteps)

585
00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:33.913
-I need to hide her.
-Whoa.

586
00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.748
(laughs):
Good luck hiding that.

587
00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:37.283
* What can I say?

588
00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:39.586
* What can I do?
What can I do? *

589
00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:41.921
(tires screeching)

590
00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:43.556
(Brill grunting)

591
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.157
BRILL:
Ow!

592
00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:48.094
* Oh! Oh!

593
00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:51.330
* Oh!

594
00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:53.766
-(tires screech)
-Oh. no.

595
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.735
-Wow...
-Brill. stay.

596
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:57.637
-(alarm beeps)
-(glass squeaking)

597
00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.938
Ruby Gillman. come out here.

598
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:00.840
We need to get you home
right now.

599
00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:03.576
(whimpers)
But...

600
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.846
I'm a... a monster.

601
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:10.517
Oh. honey.
you're not a monster.

602
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.218
Not even close.

603
00:24:14.353 --> 00:24:16.623
I don't want to yell.
Can we just talk?

604
00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:21.728
Please. just... (sighs)
just talk to me.

605
00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.066
(thuds)

606
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.309
(Ruby sighs heavily)

607
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:40.146
Hey. there's my girl.

608
00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.715
Please don't be mad.
I should have listened to you.

609
00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:44.517
But I kind of

610
00:24:44.551 --> 00:24:46.485
-went into the ocean.
-Went into the ocean?

611
00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:49.321
I know. But right now I just
want to keep you safe. honey.

612
00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:50.657
and that means
getting you home.

613
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.892
Mom. look at me.

614
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:57.329
(crying): I won't even fit
inside our house anymore.

615
00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:58.798
-Mom.
-Hey.

616
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:00.733
Hey. hey. Shh.

617
00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:03.570
You'll get small again.
It just takes a little time.

618
00:25:03.603 --> 00:25:05.371
I'm here. I'll wait with you.

619
00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:06.639
I'm not going anywhere.

620
00:25:06.673 --> 00:25:08.040
(sniffles)

621
00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:10.242
I'm really glad
you're here. Mom.

622
00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:15.548
Do you remember when you found
that whale on the beach?

623
00:25:15.582 --> 00:25:16.849
(laughs. sniffles)

624
00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:19.351
You mean
Clarence J. Whifferton?

625
00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:20.720
How could I forget?

626
00:25:20.753 --> 00:25:22.589
Clarence J. Whifferton.

627
00:25:22.622 --> 00:25:25.491
You stood next to him
with a hose for seven hours

628
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:26.826
until the tide came back in.

629
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:28.828
Oh. yeah. (sniffles)

630
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.329
I asked you
if I could keep him.

631
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.931
Where would we even
have put him?

632
00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:33.432
We had a hose. A garage.

633
00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:36.202
Come on. I would have
taken care of him.

634
00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:37.704
I know you would have.

635
00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:44.310
*

636
00:25:45.645 --> 00:25:48.280
Yes. I'm normal.

637
00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:51.117
Well. almost normal. Thank you.

638
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.753
Trust me. it's gonna be okay.

639
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:55.521
Aw...

640
00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:56.789
(Ruby screams. grunts)

641
00:25:56.823 --> 00:25:58.625
(grunts)

642
00:25:58.658 --> 00:26:00.960
Ooh. I see you got
your mom's arm strength.

643
00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:03.630
Mom. what is happening?!

644
00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:04.897
(engine starts)

645
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.966
(tires screeching)

646
00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:09.602
Hey. Tadpole. What's up?

647
00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:11.470
How would I know?
No one tells me anything.

648
00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.805
Ruby went into
the ocean. Arthur.

649
00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:14.607
-Oh. no!
-And you didn't die?

650
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:16.308
-Die? Why would she die?
-Oh. no.

651
00:26:16.342 --> 00:26:17.777
-Who's this guy?
-Who's this kid?

652
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.078
Uh. that's our son. Sam.

653
00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:21.480
Son? As in.
I'm an uncle? Again?

654
00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.215
I've never had an uncle before.

655
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:25.584
And I've never had
a nephew before.

656
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.624
Ruby. take a deep breath.

657
00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:34.326
Let me explain.

658
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.996
You see. when you went
in the ocean. it triggered...

659
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:38.665
Uh. it released...

660
00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:40.066
The kraken!

661
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:41.133
(horn tooting)

662
00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:46.639
(sighs)
What Brill means

663
00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:49.976
is you turn into
a giant kraken.

664
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.980
I know this is a lot
to process. Ruby.

665
00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:55.882
but you're not alone.

666
00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:01.220
I turn into
a giant kraken. too.

667
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.824
What? What?

668
00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:06.392
You knew?

669
00:27:08.895 --> 00:27:10.296
So. I'm this?

670
00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:12.164
The horrible stereotype
of krakens

671
00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:14.033
that you said humans made up.

672
00:27:14.066 --> 00:27:16.202
-I'm offended.
-It sells. -(horn toots)

673
00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:17.704
So what else is true
about me. Mom?

674
00:27:17.737 --> 00:27:20.539
Do I sink ships now?
Do I terrorize sailors?

675
00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:22.208
No. No. honey. Not at all.

676
00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:24.811
All this time. you told me
we were hiding from monsters.

677
00:27:24.844 --> 00:27:27.046
and it turns out
I'm the monster.

678
00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:28.614
You lied to me.

679
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.616
Think of it more as
a tiny omission.

680
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:32.384
Come on. Turn giant.
I'm recording.

681
00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:33.786
Sam. put it away.

682
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.454
But this is
the coolest thing ever.

683
00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:37.023
It is not cool.

684
00:27:37.056 --> 00:27:39.491
I was already a little weird.
but this?

685
00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:41.527
-I can't hide this.
-Yes. you can.

686
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.962
You don't get it. Mom.

687
00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:46.532
Every single day.
I make sure no one notices

688
00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:48.334
all the ways
that I am different.

689
00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:50.302
I push my hair
in front of my gills.

690
00:27:50.336 --> 00:27:52.404
and I stand
like I have a spine.

691
00:27:52.438 --> 00:27:55.975
It's hard.
but this is impossible.

692
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.977
No. because you can
control it. Ruby.

693
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.346
Just like I have
for all these years.

694
00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:03.716
Yeah. but you didn't have to go
to high school with tentacles.

695
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.317
Do I get tentacles. too?

696
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:07.586
Sorry. son. Only the women
in our family turn giant.

697
00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.722
The men just become older.
rounder versions of ourselves.

698
00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:10.823
-It's not great.
-(phone dinging)

699
00:28:10.857 --> 00:28:12.524
AGATHA:
Ruby. listen.

700
00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:13.760
The ocean triggers
the transformation.

701
00:28:13.793 --> 00:28:15.061
But if you stay on dry land.

702
00:28:15.094 --> 00:28:16.662
you'll stay small
and on two legs.

703
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.331
Cool. Everyone at school
is talking about the monster

704
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:21.167
that destroyed the library.

705
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.903
As long as no one figures out
it was you. we're safe.

706
00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.537
Your body is going
through changes.

707
00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:27.339
Think of it as blossoming.

708
00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:28.741
Ugh. Dad.

709
00:28:28.775 --> 00:28:30.409
Do your tentacles ooze poison?

710
00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.878
-AGATHA: Sam!
-How is this even
happening right now?

711
00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:33.545
As long as you stay
out of the ocean...

712
00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:34.881
-Your body is a flower.
-(Ruby groaning)

713
00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:37.116
-Do you grow any extra arms?
-Blossoming.

714
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:38.717
-Women are so lucky.
-Things will go back to normal.

715
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:41.387
-(horn tooting)
-Can everyone just stop?!

716
00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:45.624
Dad. this isn't a good thing.

717
00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:48.260
Sam. I'm going to strangle you
with my tentacles.

718
00:28:48.294 --> 00:28:49.695
And. Mom. I can't.

719
00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:50.963
I just can't right now.

720
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.234
Ah. she forgot to do me.

721
00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:57.136
I don't even know you!

722
00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:01.707
(chittering)

723
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.609
(muffled screaming)

724
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.113
BRILL: Well. why can't we
just talk about it?

725
00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:08.915
AGATHA:
Because it doesn't matter.

726
00:29:08.948 --> 00:29:10.116
Keep it down. Brill.

727
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.283
BRILL:
Sis. if I could find you.

728
00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:12.651
then it's only a matter of time

729
00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:13.953
before the rest
of the ocean can. too.

730
00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.888
I can handle this on my own.

731
00:29:15.922 --> 00:29:17.756
Just come home and talk to her.

732
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.458
-She wants to help Ruby.
-(Agatha scoffs)

733
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.127
She never just helps. though.
does she?

734
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.495
(sighs) At least tell Ruby
the whole truth.

735
00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:25.331
AGATHA: Ruby's life
is on land now. Brill.

736
00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:27.800
I know you mean well.
but you need to stop.

737
00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:30.002
Go home and let me take care
of my daughter.

738
00:29:30.036 --> 00:29:32.171
Aggie...

739
00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:33.772
(sighs)

740
00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:42.114
I can't believe Mom is still
hiding things from me.

741
00:29:42.148 --> 00:29:43.983
(squeaks)

742
00:29:45.051 --> 00:29:47.786
(gasps)
Nessie. you tiny genius.

743
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.622
That guy can't hide anything.

744
00:29:52.158 --> 00:29:54.193
(chittering)

745
00:29:57.897 --> 00:29:59.365
MAN:
Oh. put those on ice.

746
00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:00.799
MAN 2:
Good idea.

747
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:02.068
WOMAN:
I can do both for you.

748
00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:04.170
(panting)

749
00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:05.504
Wha...

750
00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:06.805
GORDON (over speaker):
Lock your doors!

751
00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:08.875
The kraken has returned!

752
00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:10.509
Brill?

753
00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:12.011
(seagull squawking)

754
00:30:12.044 --> 00:30:14.246
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

755
00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:22.521
(sighs)

756
00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:24.123
(Brill screaming)

757
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:25.992
-Brill?
-BRILL: Get off me.
you feathery demons.

758
00:30:26.025 --> 00:30:28.060
-(seagulls squawking)
-Ow! You winged dopes.

759
00:30:28.094 --> 00:30:30.196
Ow. hey. hey.

760
00:30:30.229 --> 00:30:32.965
Save yourself.
It's too late for me.

761
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:34.533
Forget the corn dog.

762
00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:36.502
(gasps) Did you see that?
They took my stick snack.

763
00:30:36.535 --> 00:30:37.970
Uncle Brill. focus.

764
00:30:38.004 --> 00:30:39.405
-I need to know.
-Mm-hmm?

765
00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:41.307
Who sent you here?

766
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.309
Mmm. No. No. no. no. No.

767
00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:44.743
Please don't ask me things.

768
00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.478
I'm so bad at keeping secrets.

769
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:48.147
Just talk to your mom.

770
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.349
-Mom won't tell me anything.
-Well. neither will I.

771
00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:52.518
She should be the one to tell
you about your grandmother.

772
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:53.585
(grunts)

773
00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:54.753
-My what?
-Nothing.

774
00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:56.222
I didn't say grandmother. What?

775
00:30:56.255 --> 00:30:58.857
Uh. I said landlubber. Ahoy?

776
00:30:58.891 --> 00:31:01.027
-I have a grandmother?
-No. no. no.

777
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.261
Please. uh. don't listen to me.

778
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:04.096
I don't know what I'm saying.

779
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.831
-I'm hungry. and I'm
traumatized from before.
-Wait.

780
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.199
-It's the birds...
-If only
the women in our family

781
00:31:07.233 --> 00:31:09.368
turn into giant krakens.

782
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:12.004
then she's a giant kraken. too.

783
00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:14.373
Uh. let the record show
I kept that part a secret.

784
00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:15.908
-Is she here?
-What? No.

785
00:31:15.942 --> 00:31:18.010
Your grandmother would never
leave the ocean.

786
00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:20.346
Honestly. I don't know how your
mom did it all these years.

787
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.382
Land is not built
for a giant kraken.

788
00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:25.918
-You're right.
-Mm-hmm.

789
00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:27.219
It's not.

790
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.589
(sighs)

791
00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.259
I don't know the first thing
about being a giant kraken.

792
00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:35.294
But it's not fair
to keep me in the dark.

793
00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:36.562
Nope. Not at all.

794
00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:39.098
I can't keep waiting
for answers.

795
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.735
-(waves crashing)
-*

796
00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:49.976
I need to take control
of my own life.

797
00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:51.077
You go. girl.

798
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.145
-I'm a kraken.
-Preach.

799
00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:55.081
And if I want answers.
then there's only one person
who can help me.

800
00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:56.949
-Your mom.
-My grandmother.

801
00:31:56.983 --> 00:31:58.117
Yeah. No. What?

802
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.451
I can't let you do that.

803
00:31:59.485 --> 00:32:01.220
-Your mom will kill me.
-(grunting)

804
00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:03.589
(groans. sighs)

805
00:32:03.622 --> 00:32:05.757
Uncle Brill... (sighs)

806
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.694
...you have been more helpful
than you can imagine.

807
00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:12.598
(sighs heavily)

808
00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:17.003
You know. this is the first hug
we've had in 15 years.

809
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.440
Then I'm really sorry.

810
00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:23.342
-For what?
-This.

811
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.745
Oh! A stick snack.

812
00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.680
(seagull squawking)

813
00:32:30.216 --> 00:32:31.650
-(Brill yelling)
-(seagulls squawking)

814
00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.119
Help!

815
00:32:33.152 --> 00:32:35.021
(Brill screaming)

816
00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:37.156
*

817
00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:41.327
(exhales)

818
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:47.633
*

819
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.353
(gasps)

820
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.826
*

821
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:17.296
Real clever
with the stick trick.

822
00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:20.032
I admit that. but... Whoa.

823
00:33:20.066 --> 00:33:22.901
Yeah. It's kind of amazing.

824
00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.403
So. there's no way
I'm getting you

825
00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.472
out of the water now. is there?

826
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.807
(sighs)
Well. follow me.

827
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.876
Wait. Uncle Brill.

828
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:32.544
Whoa. oh.

829
00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:35.847
* Look in the mirror

830
00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:38.884
-* And I start to tear up
-(laughing)

831
00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:41.987
* I don't even know
who's that I see *

832
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.324
* I'm missing the way
things used to be *

833
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:47.893
-* But I wipe 'em away now *
-(growls)

834
00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:49.995
* 'Cause I'm not afraid now *

835
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.364
(villainous laughter)

836
00:33:52.398 --> 00:33:54.900
* I'm ready to find out
who I am *

837
00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:58.036
* Even if the world
don't understand *

838
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.107
-(laughing)
-* 'Cause after
all this time finally... *

839
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.075
Clarence?

840
00:34:03.109 --> 00:34:04.876
Clarence J. Whifferton.

841
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.345
I'm so glad you made it.

842
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:08.580
(whale sounds)

843
00:34:08.614 --> 00:34:09.715
You look great.

844
00:34:09.748 --> 00:34:11.717
*

845
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.586
* Something 'bout tonight
got me feeling different *

846
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.422
* I can see the bright lights
in the distance... *

847
00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:18.357
Uncle Brill. being in the ocean

848
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.759
is more wonderful
than anything I could imagine.

849
00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:24.196
(laughs)
It only gets better from here.

850
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.866
* Something in my mind
says to keep on going *

851
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.736
* The fire inside
just keeps on glowing *

852
00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:33.539
* Tell my old self.
"Hey. you'll be missed" *

853
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:36.808
* But I've been waiting
my whole life for this *

854
00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:38.710
-(laughing)
-* Oh. oh. oh-oh-oh-oh

855
00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:40.446
* Oh. this moment

856
00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:43.115
* Oh. oh. oh. oh-oh-oh

857
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:45.417
* Oh. oh. oh-oh-oh-oh

858
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:46.752
Whoa. oh.

859
00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:49.488
* Oh. oh. oh. oh-oh-oh.

860
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:52.224
-(laughing)
-(song ends)

861
00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:53.592
Wow.

862
00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:55.427
That was wild.

863
00:34:55.461 --> 00:34:58.997
Welcome to
the Kingdom of the Krakens.

864
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.133
*

865
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.557
*

866
00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:32.364
*

867
00:35:33.699 --> 00:35:35.100
Whoa.

868
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.802
BRILL: Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.

869
00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:38.036
It's a little over the top.

870
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.172
But you know royals.

871
00:35:40.206 --> 00:35:41.307
Royals?

872
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.341
You mean my grandmother's a...

873
00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:44.142
GRANDMAMAH:
A queen!

874
00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:46.011
A warrior queen.

875
00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:47.946
Ultimate Lordess.

876
00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:50.216
Ruler of the Seven Seas.

877
00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:51.883
-et cetera. et cetera.
-(gasps)

878
00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:53.185
Give me a hug.

879
00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:55.354
So tight.

880
00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:57.189
-BRILL: Oh.
-Not now. Brill.

881
00:35:57.223 --> 00:35:58.557
It's Ruby's time now.

882
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.492
You said you'd be okay
with it. huh?

883
00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.527
Of course. Mamah.

884
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.994
I'm not that needy. so...

885
00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.063
I can't believe
you're my grandmother.

886
00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:09.401
Please. call me Grandmamah.

887
00:36:09.435 --> 00:36:11.169
You seem surprised by the level

888
00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:14.506
of general majesty
and royal splendor.

889
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.643
I definitely wasn't expecting
the whole queen thing.

890
00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:20.912
Your mother never told you
you were royalty?

891
00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:23.148
I guess it was another
tiny omission.

892
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.083
Tiny omission?!

893
00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.818
-Agatha!
-(gasps)

894
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:28.920
(whooshing)

895
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.559
Don't worry.
I go to therapy now.

896
00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:36.328
I see a wise hammerhead shark
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

897
00:36:36.362 --> 00:36:37.763
and I've let my rage go.

898
00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:39.498
Away. rage.

899
00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:41.600
Ah. cookies.

900
00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:44.436
Help yourself. Ruby.

901
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.105
Mmm. They're really...
they're really good.

902
00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.407
A little mushy.

903
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.409
I made someone
make them myself.

904
00:36:50.442 --> 00:36:53.379
Now. talk to your grandmamah.

905
00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:55.046
Tell me everything.

906
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.049
Was it horrible living among
the hairy crust dwellers?

907
00:36:58.083 --> 00:36:59.785
-You mean people?
-(laughing)

908
00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:02.388
Even the word makes
my tentacles squirm.

909
00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:03.889
People are kinda nice.
actually.

910
00:37:03.922 --> 00:37:05.257
I have a couple of friends.

911
00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:06.758
I asked a boy to prom.

912
00:37:06.792 --> 00:37:08.860
but. you know.
it... it did not go great.

913
00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:11.563
Well. deary. you can put
all that behind you.

914
00:37:11.597 --> 00:37:13.632
You're made for bigger things.

915
00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.467
Come with me.

916
00:37:15.501 --> 00:37:17.569
-*
-(excited chattering)

917
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.473
MALE:
I see her. It's Ruby.

918
00:37:21.507 --> 00:37:23.241
FEMALE:
Whoa. It's Ruby.

919
00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:25.243
-FEMALE: It's her.
-CHILD: Look. it's the princess.

920
00:37:25.277 --> 00:37:26.578
FEMALE:
Is this actually her?

921
00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:28.113
Aw. Thank you.

922
00:37:28.146 --> 00:37:29.415
MALE:
Is that Ruby?

923
00:37:29.448 --> 00:37:30.882
FEMALE:
Look. look. It's her.

924
00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.284
CHILD:
She's so pretty.

925
00:37:32.318 --> 00:37:33.585
(excited chattering)

926
00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:35.587
Hi. Ruby.

927
00:37:35.621 --> 00:37:37.756
(excited chattering continues)

928
00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:40.492
Fellow krakens.

929
00:37:40.526 --> 00:37:44.162
here at last
is my granddaughter.

930
00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.498
After 15 years.

931
00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:49.301
Princess Ruby has finally
returned home

932
00:37:49.335 --> 00:37:52.638
to be my successor.

933
00:37:52.671 --> 00:37:55.474
(cheering)

934
00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:58.410
(laughs nervously): Wait. Wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

935
00:37:58.444 --> 00:37:59.945
I'm gonna be a. a what now?

936
00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:01.913
Ruby. you're a princess.

937
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.515
-Address the crowd.
-(whimpering)

938
00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:05.317
(hyperventilating)

939
00:38:05.351 --> 00:38:07.185
(krakens gasping)

940
00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:10.088
(whimpering):
I think...

941
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:13.291
I am having a panic attack!

942
00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:15.694
-(cheering)
-MALE: Panic attack!

943
00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:17.796
(cheering fades)

944
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.002
(door creaks)

945
00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:26.372
(breathing quietly)

946
00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:28.474
(sighs heavily)

947
00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:31.877
(panting)

948
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:34.580
(squeaks)

949
00:38:36.848 --> 00:38:37.983
So. Grandma...

950
00:38:38.016 --> 00:38:39.685
Uh. "Grandmamah."

951
00:38:39.718 --> 00:38:41.553
It goes up on the second "mah."

952
00:38:41.587 --> 00:38:43.989
Oh. sorry. Um. Grandmamah.

953
00:38:44.022 --> 00:38:45.624
um. you have the wrong person.

954
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:48.694
I'm just Ruby Gillman.
normal teenager.

955
00:38:48.727 --> 00:38:50.328
Normal according to who?

956
00:38:50.362 --> 00:38:51.863
The women in our family

957
00:38:51.897 --> 00:38:54.132
have been gifted
the mighty power

958
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.635
to turn into giant kraken.

959
00:38:56.668 --> 00:39:00.806
You are only one of three giant
krakens on this Earth. Ruby.

960
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:04.209
We must protect the ocean
and its creatures.

961
00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:07.178
But many monsters have coveted
our position

962
00:39:07.212 --> 00:39:10.482
and have tried to seize
the throne for themselves.

963
00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:13.585
Brag alert.
they never succeeded.

964
00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:15.220
The Leviathan.

965
00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:16.855
Umibozu.

966
00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:19.891
and the most power-hungry
and dangerous of them all...

967
00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:21.259
The mermaid?

968
00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.329
Yes. the mermaid!

969
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.097
But people love mermaids.

970
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:28.266
Of course they do.

971
00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.068
People are stupid.

972
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:34.005
Mermaids are selfish.
vain narcissists

973
00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.541
with mediocre hair.

974
00:39:35.574 --> 00:39:39.511
and their queen. Nerissa.
the worst of them all.

975
00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:41.279
She wanted to control the ocean

976
00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:45.617
and force its creatures
to serve her and her alone.

977
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:49.120
Normally. mermaids would be
no match for us giant kraken--

978
00:39:49.154 --> 00:39:50.789
much too puny--

979
00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:53.925
but their queen found
an ancient weapon.

980
00:39:53.959 --> 00:39:56.428
the Trident of Oceanus.

981
00:39:56.462 --> 00:40:00.532
The only weapon powerful enough
to defeat a giant kraken.

982
00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:02.701
We formed the front lines
against her.

983
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.870
-and for that...
-(warriors shouting. grunting)

984
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:08.640
...we paid a terrible price.

985
00:40:08.674 --> 00:40:11.109
Frankly. I suppose
we'd all be kelp toast

986
00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:13.945
if it wasn't for your mother.

987
00:40:13.979 --> 00:40:15.213
No way.

988
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.448
That's my mom?

989
00:40:16.482 --> 00:40:17.816
Was she actually cool?

990
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:19.618
She was our greatest warrior.

991
00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:21.620
I mean. of course she was.
I taught her everything I know.

992
00:40:21.653 --> 00:40:24.923
She engaged in a great battle
with the tyrant mermaid

993
00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:27.325
and wrested away the Trident.

994
00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:30.261
I called it
her "queen-making moment."

995
00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:32.297
It was glorious.

996
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.501
Nerissa fled in disgrace.
(chuckles)

997
00:40:35.534 --> 00:40:38.970
We had a chance
to crush the mermaids forever.

998
00:40:39.004 --> 00:40:40.906
but your mother did
the unfathomable.

999
00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:42.774
She hid the Trident away.

1000
00:40:42.808 --> 00:40:45.076
left her kingdom.
left her kind.

1001
00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.746
all to play human?

1002
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.148
(whooshing)

1003
00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.817
Whoa.

1004
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.451
You have laser eyes?

1005
00:40:53.485 --> 00:40:56.254
Well. it's electrically charged
bioluminescence.

1006
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.690
but. yeah.
they do pack a wallop.

1007
00:40:58.724 --> 00:41:00.458
You have the powers.
too. you know.

1008
00:41:00.492 --> 00:41:03.595
Besides growing big
at super awkward moments?

1009
00:41:03.629 --> 00:41:05.764
You're special. Ruby.

1010
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:08.800
You feel it
in the core of your being.

1011
00:41:08.834 --> 00:41:10.836
Let me teach you.

1012
00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:13.639
But my mom told me that
if I stay out of the ocean.

1013
00:41:13.672 --> 00:41:14.973
I won't turn into a...

1014
00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:16.374
A giant kraken?

1015
00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.310
You are not a human
who turns into a kraken.

1016
00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:23.515
You're a kraken
hiding as a human.

1017
00:41:23.549 --> 00:41:25.383
Once you know
what you're capable of.

1018
00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.786
you'll want to be
the next kraken queen.

1019
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:29.721
It's your birthright.

1020
00:41:29.755 --> 00:41:33.124
And fight as you might.
fight as you will.

1021
00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:36.461
you can never outswim
your destiny.

1022
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.196
I don't know. Grandmamah.

1023
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.699
I like math and Connor.

1024
00:41:40.732 --> 00:41:44.002
You know. teen stuff.

1025
00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:47.172
Very well.

1026
00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:50.709
I loved spending this time
with you. Ruby.

1027
00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:52.744
Me. too.

1028
00:41:52.778 --> 00:41:54.880
Thank you for telling me
the truth.

1029
00:41:54.913 --> 00:41:57.348
Until we meet again.

1030
00:42:00.118 --> 00:42:02.387
Wait. You're just gonna
let her go?

1031
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.855
She'll be back.

1032
00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:06.224
A kraken always
answers the call.

1033
00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:09.094
That's what you said
about Agatha.

1034
00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:15.867
*

1035
00:42:20.939 --> 00:42:22.173
Bye. Clarence.

1036
00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:24.242
(whale sounds)

1037
00:42:29.948 --> 00:42:31.449
(gasps)

1038
00:42:33.418 --> 00:42:35.353
(gasps)
Kraken ahoy!

1039
00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.289
(strained grunting)

1040
00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:42.093
Davey. hard to port.
Full power!

1041
00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:44.963
*

1042
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:49.467
(cackling)

1043
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.437
(grunting)

1044
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.806
Fly. Fly. me beauties.

1045
00:42:56.842 --> 00:42:58.476
(gasps)
Wha...

1046
00:42:59.611 --> 00:43:00.712
(gasping)

1047
00:43:00.746 --> 00:43:02.580
Let's get a closer look at ya.

1048
00:43:02.614 --> 00:43:04.482
(grunts)

1049
00:43:06.618 --> 00:43:07.986
-Laser eyes. go!
-(crackling)

1050
00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:09.955
Laser eyes. go!

1051
00:43:09.988 --> 00:43:10.989
Laser eyes?

1052
00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:13.258
Hold her steady. Davey.

1053
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.662
(kisses. chuckles)

1054
00:43:20.766 --> 00:43:22.067
(gasps)

1055
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.301
(laughs)

1056
00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:26.071
Bit of a spicy tuna. aren't ya?

1057
00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:28.840
-Wait. Is that...?
-CHELSEA: The new girl.

1058
00:43:28.874 --> 00:43:30.676
Oh. my gosh. Hey.

1059
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:33.111
Chelsea?
H-How are you even down here?

1060
00:43:33.144 --> 00:43:38.483
Because
I'm a motherflippin' mermaid.

1061
00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:40.085
I figured I owed you
an underwater rescue

1062
00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:43.855
since I kinda. sorta. 100%
got credit for yours.

1063
00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:46.124
Time for the Gordon special.

1064
00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:48.860
Surprise. It's a bomb!

1065
00:43:49.995 --> 00:43:52.831
We should get going
or. like. die. Your call.

1066
00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:58.970
-(explosion)
-(Gordon yelling)

1067
00:43:59.004 --> 00:44:01.072
(screaming)

1068
00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:08.279
-Don't say it. Davey.
-(claws clattering)

1069
00:44:08.313 --> 00:44:10.215
You're such a naysayer.

1070
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:15.020
(breathlessly):
Okay.

1071
00:44:15.053 --> 00:44:16.654
I still can't believe
you're a...

1072
00:44:16.688 --> 00:44:18.556
A ten with a fin?
A fish come true?

1073
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:21.126
A mermaid?

1074
00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:23.161
Ooh. I can't believe I can
finally have a friend

1075
00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:24.963
to share things with.

1076
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.565
A super sea-girl bestie.

1077
00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:30.368
Look. Chelsea. thanks for what
you did back there.

1078
00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:34.239
but I started this day thinking
that my biggest issue was prom.

1079
00:44:34.272 --> 00:44:37.508
And now. I got
a whole lot more going on.

1080
00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:39.510
So I just need to go home.

1081
00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:42.647
get some sleep and pretend
this day never happened.

1082
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.884
Look. I just thought
we had a lot in common.

1083
00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:50.255
but if you're gonna be salty
about it. then bye-bye.

1084
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.529
-(hinges creaking)
-(crickets chirping)

1085
00:45:00.098 --> 00:45:02.133
(sighs)

1086
00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:07.305
(Nessie purring)

1087
00:45:08.874 --> 00:45:11.743
-(alarm ringing)
-(gasping)

1088
00:45:11.777 --> 00:45:13.411
(sighs heavily)

1089
00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.880
-Okay. Ruby. you got this.
-(ringing stops)

1090
00:45:14.913 --> 00:45:16.748
You just need
to make it to school

1091
00:45:16.782 --> 00:45:19.250
and have a completely.
totally ordinary day.

1092
00:45:19.284 --> 00:45:21.452
-Huh?
-(panting)

1093
00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:24.422
(exhales. sniffs)

1094
00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:28.794
ARTHUR:
Honey.

1095
00:45:28.827 --> 00:45:31.029
you've gotta stop
beating yourself up.

1096
00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.798
Oh. Arthur.

1097
00:45:32.831 --> 00:45:34.699
I can't believe I didn't
tell her any of this sooner.

1098
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.201
I mean. what was I thinking?

1099
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:38.369
You were thinking about
protecting her.

1100
00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:39.905
like you always have.

1101
00:45:39.938 --> 00:45:41.807
What if she drops out
of school?

1102
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.809
I mean. what if she doesn't get
a job and runs away like I did?

1103
00:45:43.842 --> 00:45:47.745
(gasps) What if she hates me
like I hate my mom?

1104
00:45:47.779 --> 00:45:49.614
It's a slippery slope. Arthur.

1105
00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:51.282
Hate's a strong word.

1106
00:45:51.316 --> 00:45:52.550
And she loves you.

1107
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.252
She'll never run away.

1108
00:45:54.285 --> 00:45:56.354
(door creaks open)

1109
00:46:00.191 --> 00:46:01.927
Huh. This doesn't help my case.

1110
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.829
Ruby. hey. How are you feeling?

1111
00:46:03.862 --> 00:46:06.764
Did you sleep okay?
Everything back to normal?

1112
00:46:06.798 --> 00:46:08.766
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Totally fine.

1113
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.936
Are you sure?
Oh. you look a little flushed.

1114
00:46:10.969 --> 00:46:13.204
Mom. I'm fine. Really.

1115
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.441
(sniffing)

1116
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:20.745
Ruby. is that salt water
on your breath?

1117
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.313
Salt water? What?

1118
00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.748
No. I really gotta go.

1119
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.783
Good. Okay.
Well. if you do want to talk.

1120
00:46:25.817 --> 00:46:27.152
I'll be right here.

1121
00:46:27.185 --> 00:46:28.820
I just... I just really
want you to know

1122
00:46:28.854 --> 00:46:30.655
that you never have
to hide things from me.

1123
00:46:30.688 --> 00:46:32.757
-Hmm. like you?
-What did you say. honey?

1124
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.425
Nothing. Bye. Mom.

1125
00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:36.361
Love you. Make good choices.

1126
00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:38.063
(sighs)

1127
00:46:40.031 --> 00:46:41.632
(sighs heavily)

1128
00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.769
* High

1129
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.138
* There's a reason
for my high *

1130
00:46:47.172 --> 00:46:49.140
* There's a whole world
outside... *

1131
00:46:49.174 --> 00:46:52.177
It destroyed the YA Zombie
Romance section.

1132
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:55.013
The YA Zombie Romance section!

1133
00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:56.347
-MAN: Eric.
-ERIC: Yeah.

1134
00:46:56.381 --> 00:46:57.515
-Take a look at this.
-Nonfiction?

1135
00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:58.616
Mom. I changed my mind.

1136
00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.817
I want to be homeschooled again.

1137
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:00.952
I never liked that
library anyway.

1138
00:47:00.986 --> 00:47:02.387
BOY:
We have a library?

1139
00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.622
Godzilla could not beat
that thing in a fight.

1140
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.657
A tentacled freak
from the deep shows up.
and I'm supposed to learn math?

1141
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:07.725
BOY 2:
So gross.

1142
00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.294
-There you are!
-(screams)

1143
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:10.862
Why'd you stop answering
our texts last night?

1144
00:47:10.896 --> 00:47:12.697
I was worried
that monster got to you.

1145
00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.400
I carved us each a whistle
out of juniper wood.

1146
00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:16.968
Blowing it could give you
precious seconds

1147
00:47:17.002 --> 00:47:18.703
to abscond with your lives.

1148
00:47:18.736 --> 00:47:20.005
Sick. Juniper wood
has been known

1149
00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:21.806
to have kraken-defeating powers.

1150
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.208
What? Kraken?

1151
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:24.842
Why would you say that?

1152
00:47:24.876 --> 00:47:26.878
Ev-Everyone knows that krakens
aren't real. so...

1153
00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:28.413
Behold. a plot twist.

1154
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:31.682
15 years ago.
you all laughed at me.

1155
00:47:31.716 --> 00:47:33.384
Sorry. Not you. Davey.

1156
00:47:33.418 --> 00:47:35.253
You're right.
you always believed me.

1157
00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:39.657
But now I finally have proof
that krakens exist.

1158
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.160
A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

1159
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:43.528
(gasps)
Kraken!

1160
00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:45.663
Kraken ahoy! She's back!

1161
00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.332
(panting)

1162
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:49.034
Oh. she's coming for me.

1163
00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:52.003
(yells) Davey.
get the picturephone.

1164
00:47:52.037 --> 00:47:53.338
-(screams)
-(splashing)

1165
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:54.940
WOMAN:
Do you see it?

1166
00:47:54.973 --> 00:47:57.208
With your help.
we will drag this abomination

1167
00:47:57.242 --> 00:48:02.280
into the light and finally
reveal what it truly is.

1168
00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:04.249
(Gordon cackling)

1169
00:48:04.282 --> 00:48:06.884
(chuckles) Can't help
but root for that guy.

1170
00:48:06.918 --> 00:48:11.422
A great darkness has risen
from the depths to claim us all.

1171
00:48:11.456 --> 00:48:13.858
And this time.
she is not catastrophizing.

1172
00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.560
I mean. this is wacky Gordon.

1173
00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:16.928
You can't take him seriously.

1174
00:48:16.962 --> 00:48:19.097
He only has. like.
ten subscribers.

1175
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.598
-For now.
-Huh?

1176
00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.767
Trevin is sharing it across
all of his socials.

1177
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.302
-He's what?
-What? You've never
heard of my channel?

1178
00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:25.770
A lot of people watch
my gaming live streams.

1179
00:48:25.803 --> 00:48:27.072
How many is a lot?

1180
00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:28.906
About a hundred and forty...
thousand.

1181
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.943
-(gasps)
-And... video posted.

1182
00:48:31.977 --> 00:48:33.544
-There. it's out there
forever now.
-Wait.

1183
00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:35.380
GORDON (through phones):
Kraken! Kraken! Kraken ahoy!

1184
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:36.814
CONNOR:
Dude. can you believe it?

1185
00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.283
-Kraken! Kraken!
-That old boat dude was right.

1186
00:48:38.316 --> 00:48:40.718
-Kraken ahoy!
-That thing is legit a monster.

1187
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:42.453
A real-life monster.

1188
00:48:42.487 --> 00:48:44.722
-MARGOT: Ruby? Cue Ruby.
-(hyperventilating)

1189
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:45.756
(groans)

1190
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.325
Bliss. get the smelling salts.

1191
00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:48.893
(whimpering)

1192
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.428
Where are you going?

1193
00:48:50.461 --> 00:48:52.097
You forgot your whistle!

1194
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.731
GORDON (through phones):
Kraken! Kraken!

1195
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.266
-(panting)
-Kraken ahoy!

1196
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.402
Kraken! Kraken!

1197
00:48:57.435 --> 00:48:59.270
-Kraken ahoy!
-No running in the halls.

1198
00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:04.409
(breathing rapidly)

1199
00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:06.811
(gasping for air.
breathing slows)

1200
00:49:08.213 --> 00:49:09.780
(door creaks open)

1201
00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:11.782
BOY:
With a kraken running loose.

1202
00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:13.351
you could use a bodyguard.

1203
00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:14.352
CHELSEA:
Aw. you're sweet.

1204
00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:15.586
The monster could be lurking

1205
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.621
around any corner.

1206
00:49:16.654 --> 00:49:17.788
I'd fight it for you.

1207
00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:19.157
-Chelsea?
-(high-pitched scream)

1208
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.225
Can I talk to you?

1209
00:49:21.126 --> 00:49:22.693
Okay. everyone out.

1210
00:49:22.727 --> 00:49:24.829
-Private talk time. Bye.
-(students grumbling)

1211
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.765
So. what's up?

1212
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.767
Chelsea. about last night.
I am sorry that I ran...

1213
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.303
Oh. Apologies are so corny.

1214
00:49:32.337 --> 00:49:34.972
Just skip to the part
where you tell me everything.

1215
00:49:35.006 --> 00:49:37.108
Look. I... (sighs)

1216
00:49:37.142 --> 00:49:40.178
You are here on land one day.
and you already fit in.

1217
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:43.781
I've been here all of my life.
and I still feel like a freak.

1218
00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:47.785
I-I just want to be
Ruby Gillman. normal teenager.

1219
00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.855
Oh. boo.
Where's the fun in that?

1220
00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:52.823
Ruby. you're a giant kraken.

1221
00:49:52.857 --> 00:49:55.293
Don't you think you could aim
a little bit higher

1222
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:58.029
than "normal teenager"?

1223
00:49:58.063 --> 00:50:02.067
Oh. my cute little. floppy.
baby guppy girl.

1224
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.734
You know what you need?

1225
00:50:03.768 --> 00:50:05.570
Great hair and a mermaid tail?

1226
00:50:05.603 --> 00:50:07.972
(laughs)
No. but it would help.

1227
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.874
What you need. Ruby Gillman.

1228
00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:12.910
is to see how great
your life could be.

1229
00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:16.447
You need a super sea-girl
ditch day!

1230
00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:19.684
Okay. Let's do it.

1231
00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:22.187
-Yay!
-(laughing)

1232
00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.489
MAN (over P.A.):
Just four more days until prom.

1233
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:26.524
the last evening of joy

1234
00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:29.094
before entering the drudgery
of adulthood.

1235
00:50:29.127 --> 00:50:31.196
("plastic pony" by mxmtoon
playing)

1236
00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:36.201
(Chelsea laughing)

1237
00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:37.868
-* I bought a ticket to life
-Woo-hoo!

1238
00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:39.404
-* Rose-colored eyes
-Whoa!

1239
00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:43.040
* Made a home
in halls of mirrors *

1240
00:50:43.074 --> 00:50:45.710
* It was all fun and games

1241
00:50:45.743 --> 00:50:50.715
* Love what I played.
but now I see a little clearer *

1242
00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:54.419
* The more that I see myself

1243
00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:58.456
* The less that I know
about me *

1244
00:50:58.489 --> 00:51:02.593
* Was riding the carousel
up and down... *

1245
00:51:02.627 --> 00:51:03.928
This day's been amazing.

1246
00:51:03.961 --> 00:51:05.863
I mean.
seven seas in seven hours?

1247
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.698
And don't get me started
about how wrong they got

1248
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:10.067
the crystal jellyfish in the
Marine Biologist Quarterly.

1249
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:12.470
Sorry.
Am I geeking out too much?

1250
00:51:12.503 --> 00:51:14.539
No.

1251
00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:17.041
(both laughing)

1252
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.043
(sighs)

1253
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:23.448
I still can't believe your mom
hid all of this from you.

1254
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:26.151
"Hiding is surviving."

1255
00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:27.718
That's the Gillman
family motto.

1256
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:29.754
Mottoes are stupid.
That's my motto.

1257
00:51:29.787 --> 00:51:31.088
I hate hiding.

1258
00:51:31.122 --> 00:51:32.723
But you're crushing it
at school.

1259
00:51:32.757 --> 00:51:34.225
Everyone loves you.

1260
00:51:34.259 --> 00:51:36.093
You really do have everything.

1261
00:51:36.127 --> 00:51:37.728
(scoffs)
No. I don't.

1262
00:51:37.762 --> 00:51:39.964
Ever since
the Battle of the Trident.

1263
00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:42.467
all us mermaids
have been in hiding.

1264
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.469
I couldn't take it anymore.

1265
00:51:44.502 --> 00:51:47.938
I felt trapped. so I ran away.

1266
00:51:47.972 --> 00:51:51.842
But when I ended up
at Oceanside High. I was alone.

1267
00:51:51.876 --> 00:51:54.779
No one could see the real me.

1268
00:51:54.812 --> 00:51:59.650
And then I found you.
my super sea-girl bestie.

1269
00:51:59.684 --> 00:52:02.287
and now everything is right
in the world.

1270
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.622
If it wasn't for this whole
mermaid versus kraken war.

1271
00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:07.825
you and I could be this free
all the time.

1272
00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.427
Oh. sure. Yeah.

1273
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.030
But. I mean. two teenage girls
can't fix history.

1274
00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:16.267
Wait. What's the first rule
of being a mathlete?

1275
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:18.969
Hmm. Never talk about
being a mathlete?

1276
00:52:19.003 --> 00:52:21.706
No. We have to evaluate
the problem.

1277
00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:23.541
Chelsea. come on.

1278
00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:25.676
There must be some way
to end this war

1279
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.445
so you won't have to hide
from the krakens

1280
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:29.647
and I won't have to become
a prophesied princess warrior

1281
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.981
of an interspecies vendetta.

1282
00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:34.785
Well. there is one way.

1283
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:36.621
Picture this:

1284
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:39.690
Chelsea Van Der Zee
and Ruby Gillman save the seas

1285
00:52:39.724 --> 00:52:42.560
by finding
the Trident of Oceanus.

1286
00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:44.562
That giant fork
my grandma's so obsessed with?

1287
00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:47.365
Yes. The Trident.
Stay with me.

1288
00:52:47.398 --> 00:52:49.166
Once we have the Trident.

1289
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.369
we can show that there doesn't
have to be a war anymore.

1290
00:52:51.402 --> 00:52:55.573
It can be a symbol of peace.

1291
00:52:55.606 --> 00:52:57.742
Then my grandmother wouldn't
have to train me for battle.

1292
00:52:57.775 --> 00:53:01.246
I can live in the ocean
and on land as the real me.

1293
00:53:01.279 --> 00:53:02.980
No more fighting.

1294
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.550
And the mermaids wouldn't have
to live in fear anymore.

1295
00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.851
No more hiding.

1296
00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:08.553
-No fighting.
-No hiding.

1297
00:53:08.586 --> 00:53:13.258
BOTH: No fighting! No hiding!
No fighting! No hiding!

1298
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:15.192
WOMAN:
I'm nervous about the barbecue.

1299
00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.894
AGATHA:
Oh. Carol. come on.

1300
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.364
No one knows what happened
exactly to the library.

1301
00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:21.266
Sam. no headphones
at the table.

1302
00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:23.234
-CAROL: It's completely gone.
-It could have been a gas leak.

1303
00:53:23.268 --> 00:53:26.437
Trust me. your buyers are gonna
love Oceanside's tranquility.

1304
00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:28.105
REPORTER: Tranquility
has turned to terror

1305
00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:30.375
here in Oceanside
as more and more witnesses

1306
00:53:30.408 --> 00:53:32.743
report having seen
the giant kraken.

1307
00:53:32.777 --> 00:53:35.079
(laughing):
Knock. knock. Who's there?

1308
00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:37.282
It's Uncle Brill.
I'm already inside.

1309
00:53:37.315 --> 00:53:38.683
Ooh. don't mind if I do.

1310
00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:40.918
Just one second. Carol.
(feigns laughter)

1311
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.453
-(grunts)
-What are you doing here?

1312
00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:44.689
When I came back empty-handed.
Mom hit the roof.

1313
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:46.424
I need a place to crash
till she cools down.

1314
00:53:46.457 --> 00:53:48.058
A few months. a couple years.

1315
00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:49.927
Century. tops.

1316
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.429
Um. hon. uh. this isn't good.

1317
00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:53.798
I'm here
with Captain Gordon Lighthouse.

1318
00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:55.966
Now. Mr. Lighthouse. you
allegedly claim to have seen...

1319
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.302
The face of death!

1320
00:53:57.335 --> 00:53:59.069
Allegedly.

1321
00:53:59.103 --> 00:54:00.538
-Ow. ow. ow. Ow.
-You out there.

1322
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.574
I need any able-bodied man.
woman or child

1323
00:54:03.608 --> 00:54:05.376
-to help crew my vessel...
-REPORTER: Get off. Ow! Ooh.

1324
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.144
...and capture the kraken!

1325
00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.046
(screams)
That guy's terrifying.

1326
00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.781
and I live with a warlord.

1327
00:54:10.815 --> 00:54:12.650
Aggie. he's got her on video.

1328
00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:14.151
CAROL: Agatha. are you still
there? What's going on?

1329
00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:15.553
No. it's nothing.

1330
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:17.221
Bring your buyers Saturday.

1331
00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.823
ARTHUR:
Uh-oh.

1332
00:54:18.856 --> 00:54:20.625
-She's got that look.
-The one where she wants us

1333
00:54:20.658 --> 00:54:23.328
to do something
we don't want to do.

1334
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:26.397
I've been searching for kraken
me entire life.

1335
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:28.799
And it cost me dearly.

1336
00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:30.167
-(claws clattering)
-Oh. fine. yes.

1337
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.269
But if it wasn't
for the kraken.

1338
00:54:32.303 --> 00:54:34.472
I wouldn't have bought the boat.
and without the boat.

1339
00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:36.341
I wouldn't have
mortgaged my house. and if
I didn't mortgage my house.

1340
00:54:36.374 --> 00:54:38.476
Tammy wouldn't have left me.

1341
00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:40.077
Huh. Been there.

1342
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.679
(whispering): Are we still
talking about krakens?

1343
00:54:41.712 --> 00:54:43.681
Gordon. if it's from the ocean.
I'm your man.

1344
00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:46.150
And I can wield this baby.
no problem.

1345
00:54:46.183 --> 00:54:48.085
(laughs nervously)
He knows this should
only be handled

1346
00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.587
by a responsible adult.

1347
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.256
-Ooh. pointy.
-And who might you be?

1348
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:53.858
Name's Brill. Born of the dirt.
live in the dirt.

1349
00:54:53.891 --> 00:54:56.226
will be buried in the dirt.
Don't like water.

1350
00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:03.768
-(exclaims. grunts)
-(Arthur gasps)

1351
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:05.370
Hmm.

1352
00:55:05.403 --> 00:55:07.171
We call him Buckethead.

1353
00:55:07.204 --> 00:55:09.374
He's not too bright. but he can
take a lot of punishment.

1354
00:55:09.407 --> 00:55:11.942
Impressive.

1355
00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:13.811
You're hired!

1356
00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:15.145
Buckethead. you're with me.

1357
00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:18.549
Ah. now. don't be jelly. Davey.

1358
00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:23.788
Whoa.

1359
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:25.390
What is this place?

1360
00:55:25.423 --> 00:55:27.625
CHELSEA:
The Well of Seas.

1361
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.828
The source of all
the ocean's energy.

1362
00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:33.564
That's where your mother hid
the Trident of Oceanus.

1363
00:55:33.598 --> 00:55:36.000
She did? How did you know that?

1364
00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:38.803
Because she took it from
my mother. the mermaid queen.

1365
00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:40.137
and hid it in there.

1366
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.240
My mom died
trying to get it back.

1367
00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.542
I am so sorry.

1368
00:55:44.575 --> 00:55:46.076
It's not your fault.

1369
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.945
They were enemies.

1370
00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:51.416
So how are we supposed
to get it?

1371
00:55:51.449 --> 00:55:54.552
Each current has its own force.
its own power.

1372
00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:56.587
You have to swim through
all of the currents

1373
00:55:56.621 --> 00:55:59.590
to get to the center
where the Trident is hidden.

1374
00:55:59.624 --> 00:56:02.226
Only a giant kraken
can survive it.

1375
00:56:02.259 --> 00:56:04.862
It has to be you. Ruby.

1376
00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:07.331
Okay.

1377
00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:09.934
It's just an underwater
volcano of death.

1378
00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:14.104
So. step one:
Evaluate the problem.

1379
00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:18.709
(grunting)

1380
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:21.546
(gasps)

1381
00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:32.723
Okay. The problem is bad.

1382
00:56:32.757 --> 00:56:34.892
It's really bad.

1383
00:56:34.925 --> 00:56:38.596
Uh. we might need some help.

1384
00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:41.566
*

1385
00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:44.902
Ruby. Oh. what a surprise.

1386
00:56:44.935 --> 00:56:46.471
Show me how to use my powers.

1387
00:56:46.504 --> 00:56:49.406
Oh. I thought you'd never ask.

1388
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.241
*

1389
00:56:52.477 --> 00:56:54.111
RUBY:
Okay. where do we start?

1390
00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:56.080
-Laser eyes?
-Before you fly
through the ocean.

1391
00:56:56.113 --> 00:56:57.715
you must first learn to swim.

1392
00:56:57.748 --> 00:56:59.049
You know my swimming
is pretty good.

1393
00:56:59.083 --> 00:57:00.951
so maybe I could skip ahead

1394
00:57:00.985 --> 00:57:03.721
and we could
unleash my laser eyes.

1395
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:05.523
Pew. pew. Pew. pew.

1396
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.459
Whoa. (grunting)

1397
00:57:08.493 --> 00:57:10.661
You must accept
your "kraken-ness"

1398
00:57:10.695 --> 00:57:13.330
and leave your land self behind.

1399
00:57:15.332 --> 00:57:16.767
Uh. whoa.

1400
00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:22.473
* Good night. stress.
see you in the mornin' *

1401
00:57:23.508 --> 00:57:24.609
-Yay!
-* Oh *

1402
00:57:24.642 --> 00:57:25.910
* I don't gotta guess *

1403
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.311
* You're always there for me *

1404
00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:29.780
-(gasps)
-* Oh *

1405
00:57:29.814 --> 00:57:31.315
* Sowin' them seeds of doubt *

1406
00:57:31.348 --> 00:57:34.351
* I think you like
seeing me freak out *

1407
00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:37.855
* Good night. stress.
I'll see you in mornin' *

1408
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.191
* So I wake up.
I get out of bed *

1409
00:57:41.225 --> 00:57:43.260
-(gasps. grunts)
-* Stay up

1410
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.829
* Stay out of my head

1411
00:57:44.862 --> 00:57:46.363
-* 'Cause it's dangerous *
-(yelling)

1412
00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:48.533
* And I don't wanna
lose my mind. no *

1413
00:57:48.566 --> 00:57:49.834
CHELSEA:
Ooh.

1414
00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:51.536
* I just wanna shine

1415
00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:54.104
* Like the sun
when it comes up... *

1416
00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:55.439
A giant kraken's
greatest weapon...

1417
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:56.841
Laser eyes?

1418
00:57:56.874 --> 00:57:58.643
No. It's our strength.

1419
00:57:58.676 --> 00:58:00.778
Both inner and outer.

1420
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:02.847
(strained grunting)

1421
00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:05.516
Mmm.

1422
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:06.951
Now you can say it.

1423
00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.353
BOTH:
Laser eyes.

1424
00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:12.322
The first step is to summon
your passionate fury.

1425
00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:15.225
Passionate fury?
Like when my locker jams
right before class.

1426
00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:16.493
Dig deeper.

1427
00:58:16.527 --> 00:58:17.695
My friends ditching me for prom.

1428
00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:18.829
Deeper.

1429
00:58:18.863 --> 00:58:22.066
When my mom lies to my face!

1430
00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:24.835
(cries out)
How do you shut them off?

1431
00:58:24.869 --> 00:58:27.137
*

1432
00:58:27.171 --> 00:58:29.339
Have you guys seen Ruby?

1433
00:58:29.373 --> 00:58:30.841
No. not really.

1434
00:58:30.875 --> 00:58:34.144
Gasp. A rose.

1435
00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:35.913
* I already had those

1436
00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:37.381
* Oh *

1437
00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:39.984
* I'm just trying
to figure out *

1438
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.686
* How to be myself right now

1439
00:58:41.719 --> 00:58:45.389
* I don't wanna lay low
hiding in the shadows *

1440
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:47.692
* So I wake up

1441
00:58:47.725 --> 00:58:49.159
-Whoa.
-* I get out of bed

1442
00:58:49.193 --> 00:58:50.595
* Stay up

1443
00:58:50.628 --> 00:58:52.329
-(screaming)
-* Stay out of my head

1444
00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:53.898
-(alarm ringing)
-* 'Cause it's dangerous *

1445
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:56.033
* And I don't wanna lose
my mind. no... *

1446
00:58:56.066 --> 00:58:57.868
(grunts)

1447
00:58:57.902 --> 00:59:01.238
Ruby. I see in you
a heart as big as the ocean.

1448
00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:05.109
Honey. a thick skin
is a queen's ultimate defense.

1449
00:59:05.142 --> 00:59:06.677
Body armor.

1450
00:59:06.711 --> 00:59:09.747
Whoa. That's almost cooler
than laser eyes.

1451
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.048
Almost.

1452
00:59:12.082 --> 00:59:13.884
-GORDON: Kraken! Kraken!
-(zapping)

1453
00:59:13.918 --> 00:59:15.686
Kraken! Kraken ahoy!

1454
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.954
BOY:
Hey.

1455
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:22.559
Ruby? We have been looking
all over for you.

1456
00:59:22.593 --> 00:59:25.630
So much for squad solidarity.

1457
00:59:25.663 --> 00:59:27.665
*

1458
00:59:35.673 --> 00:59:37.474
(song ends)

1459
00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.576
(water rushing)

1460
00:59:46.651 --> 00:59:48.919
(strained grunting)

1461
00:59:50.087 --> 00:59:51.622
BOY:
A freak from the deep shows up.

1462
00:59:51.656 --> 00:59:53.323
and I'm supposed to learn math?

1463
00:59:53.357 --> 00:59:55.793
GRANDMAMAH: You're a kraken
hiding as a human.

1464
00:59:55.826 --> 00:59:57.762
AGATHA: If you stay on dry land.
you'll stay small.

1465
00:59:57.795 --> 00:59:59.063
CONNOR:
That thing is a monster.

1466
00:59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.098
A real-life monster.

1467
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.367
(screaming)

1468
01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.203
(grunts) Whoa!

1469
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.274
Whoa!

1470
01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:11.976
(grunts)

1471
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.311
(frustrated groaning)

1472
01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.781
(sighs)

1473
01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:19.149
So... can you get it?

1474
01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.151
I was so close. I could see it.

1475
01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:23.688
Well. then how did your mom
make it through?

1476
01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.255
I don't know.

1477
01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.457
But I guess
I'll have to do something

1478
01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:28.959
I never thought I'd do.

1479
01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:29.960
What's that?

1480
01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:32.196
Ask my mom for advice.

1481
01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:36.466
* There once was a ship
that put to sea *

1482
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.136
* The name of the ship
was Billy of Tea *

1483
01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.204
(Sam laughing)

1484
01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:41.438
* The wind blew up...

1485
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.741
Argh! What is going on
down there?

1486
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.711
First. you burned out
me engines.

1487
01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:48.779
Then you clogged up
my bilge pump.

1488
01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.816
And now we've been
off course for hours.

1489
01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.818
Now. where is my kraken?

1490
01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.619
Kraken ahoy.

1491
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.288
-Sam. that's our signal.
It's go time.
-Got it.

1492
01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.524
Davey. cue music!

1493
01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.226
* It is the night

1494
01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.328
* My body's weak... *

1495
01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:07.798
There'll be no escaping
this time!

1496
01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:10.000
* I've got to ride... *

1497
01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:12.202
(straining)

1498
01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.570
(grunting)

1499
01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.475
Wow. Gordon. you did it.

1500
01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.177
You've slayed the beast!

1501
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.514
And here's your proof.
the kraken's baby itself.

1502
01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.717
But it's so tiny.

1503
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.252
ARTHUR:
Careful.

1504
01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:31.588
The babies are the most deadly.

1505
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.057
Deadly?

1506
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.226
But it looks almost. uh. cute.

1507
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.763
Ah. Davey! Davey!

1508
01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:39.897
Oh. no.

1509
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.365
(screaming)
Don't kill me.

1510
01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.034
Oh. please don't kill me.
kraken monster!

1511
01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:46.070
(chittering weakly)

1512
01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.106
(panting)

1513
01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.575
Oh. I did it.

1514
01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.778
I survived a deadly
kraken baby attack.

1515
01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.246
Oh. finally. I've got my proof.

1516
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.882
(cackles)

1517
01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.885
Wouldn't want to divorce me
now. would ya. Tammy?

1518
01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.020
Cabin boy. take a picture.

1519
01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.855
This is for all my haters.

1520
01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:07.424
Your one-star reviews
mean nothing.

1521
01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.795
Boys. this calls for
a celebratory sea chantey.

1522
01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:13.263
You go low.
* I'll go high. *

1523
01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.566
-(chittering)
-Nessie. you tiny genius.

1524
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.270
Ooh. I'm so nervous
to meet your mom.

1525
01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.439
She's gonna know that
I'm a mermaid right away.

1526
01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.775
How's my hair?
Feels like it's frizzing up.

1527
01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:27.544
and you can't trust a person
with frizz. Ruby.

1528
01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.380
Chelsea. you're my super
sea-girl bestie.

1529
01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.816
It's gonna be fine.

1530
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:34.151
-No fighting.
-No hiding.

1531
01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.821
(phone chiming)

1532
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.059
-(phone beeps)
-(exhales heavily)

1533
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.327
BRILL:
A stick snack?

1534
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.594
-A stick snack?
-Get your stick snack.

1535
01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:45.996
Can I offer you a stick snack?

1536
01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.564
Stick snack for he?
Stick snack for she?

1537
01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.399
Hey. Gary. Make sure you
check out the pool house.

1538
01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.936
Oh. Agatha. you were right.
What was I ever worried about?

1539
01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.771
I told you. Carol.
There's no better place
to raise a family.

1540
01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.106
Now. if you'll excuse me.

1541
01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.976
There she is.

1542
01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.677
Aggie. I'm so proud of you.

1543
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.612
This is everything you've
worked for all these years.

1544
01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.448
Well. I couldn't have done it
without my...

1545
01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.916
(whispering):
kraken crew.

1546
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.952
-(chuckling)
-Say. have you heard from...

1547
01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.753
Ruby. Hey. stranger.

1548
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.288
I knew you'd make it.

1549
01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.457
Mom. I need to talk to you
about something big.

1550
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.458
Is it about prom? Because...

1551
01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.361
No. And yes. But no.

1552
01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.997
It's about something
so much more than prom.

1553
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.499
The ocean. Peace. Happiness.

1554
01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.434
We want all the same stuff
you wanted.

1555
01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.870
and we have a plan.

1556
01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.038
-But we need your help.
-We?

1557
01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.941
I want you to meet my super
sea-girl bestie. Chelsea.

1558
01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.209
-(girl mumbling)
-Ah.

1559
01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:33.777
What is going on. Ruby?

1560
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.445
Before you freak out.
she is a mermaid.

1561
01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.713
but you're gonna love her.

1562
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.483
Inside. Now.

1563
01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.018
Ruby. you have to listen to me.

1564
01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.053
You don't understand
the danger you're in.

1565
01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.489
We left the ocean
because of a mermaid.

1566
01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:47.191
Don't worry.
She's not like her mom.

1567
01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:49.159
-Her mom?
-The mermaid queen.

1568
01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.661
She's the mermaid queen's
daughter?

1569
01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.297
Yeah. but she's my friend.

1570
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.332
She is not your friend.
She is dangerous.

1571
01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.367
(sighs)
You sound like Grandmamah.

1572
01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:00.170
I'm sorry. I sound like who?

1573
01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.872
Grandmamah.
She's been training me.

1574
01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:03.807
She told me why you left.

1575
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.809
Training you? For what?

1576
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.179
Mom. don't you see? This is
our chance to fix everything.

1577
01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.348
Ruby. you are in over your head.

1578
01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.217
You do not know
the whole story.

1579
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.718
And whose fault is that?

1580
01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.086
Hey. I tried to talk to you.

1581
01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.321
I wanted to tell you
everything sooner.

1582
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.989
but I also needed
to keep you safe

1583
01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.524
and give you a normal life.

1584
01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.993
Normal? Normal isn't hiding
in this fake town.

1585
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.594
living a fake life.

1586
01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.364
I sacrificed everything
to give you this "fake life."

1587
01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.599
I'm not gonna hide anymore!

1588
01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:30.600
(crackling)

1589
01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.202
Oh. No. no. no. no. no.

1590
01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.270
Brill!

1591
01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.106
Distraction.

1592
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.775
Hey. everybody. Um. watch how
high I can throw my nephew.

1593
01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.012
-(Sam screaming)
-(partygoers gasping)

1594
01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.180
MAN:
Where'd he go?

1595
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.448
(screaming continues)

1596
01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:45.749
-(Brill grunts)
-(Arthur gasps)

1597
01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:46.883
(partygoers exclaiming)

1598
01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.585
Ta-da!

1599
01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.255
(laughing and cheering)

1600
01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:54.724
We are gonna change the world
with or without you.

1601
01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.393
Ruby. I get it. You're angry.

1602
01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.461
You want to fight.

1603
01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:58.929
So did I when I was your age.

1604
01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:01.098
But trust me.
this is the wrong fight.

1605
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:02.632
You're on the wrong side.

1606
01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.434
You can't tell me
how to live my life.

1607
01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.870
Oh. yes. I can.
I am still your mother.

1608
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.939
You are forbidden
from going in the ocean again.

1609
01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:10.874
Now go home and calm down!

1610
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.043
(Ruby yelling)

1611
01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:14.844
(Ruby screaming)

1612
01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:17.614
*

1613
01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.853
Agatha. are you okay?

1614
01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.456
(clattering)

1615
01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:31.628
What happened?

1616
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.163
Ruby's made friends
with Nerissa's daughter.

1617
01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:34.564
Oh. no.

1618
01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.967
And my mother
has been training her.

1619
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.568
(gasps)

1620
01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:42.772
15 years. and she still
has her tentacles around me.

1621
01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:43.907
What about Ruby?

1622
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.809
Oh. she hates me right now.

1623
01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:47.777
(sighs)
Go find her.

1624
01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.846
Make sure she's safe.

1625
01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.382
I'm gonna deal with my mother.

1626
01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:56.987
*

1627
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.791
Ruby. wait.

1628
01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:04.261
Are you okay?
What happened back there?

1629
01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.463
My mom just wants things
to stay the same.

1630
01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.932
She wants me to stay the same.

1631
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.668
But this time.
I'm not turning back.

1632
01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.709
*

1633
01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:25.049
AGATHA:
Mother!

1634
01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.988
And here I thought I knew
how to make an entrance.

1635
01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.458
Stay away from my daughter.

1636
01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.293
You mean my granddaughter?

1637
01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.728
The princess?
The heir to the throne?

1638
01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.330
Still trying to get your way.

1639
01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.532
(scoffs):
Some things never change.

1640
01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:43.733
You're trying to force
your daughter

1641
01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.902
into a life she doesn't want.

1642
01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.205
Now. where have I heard
that before?

1643
01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.707
The difference is
I didn't raise my daughter

1644
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.509
to be a reflection of my glory.

1645
01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:53.977
Well. that's certainly true.

1646
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.846
You raised her to run away
and hide.

1647
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.982
You still think
I was scared to fight.

1648
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.151
You think it was easy
to start over?

1649
01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.552
To risk everything?

1650
01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.488
I never stopped fighting.

1651
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.556
I fight for my family.

1652
01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.192
I fight for who I love.

1653
01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.559
You?

1654
01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:10.927
You just love to fight!

1655
01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.997
She's just a kid.

1656
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.032
A sweet. naive kid.

1657
01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:17.867
And now she's in trouble.

1658
01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:19.836
She made friends
with a mermaid.

1659
01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.105
-What?
-Yes.

1660
01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.606
The daughter
of the mermaid queen.

1661
01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.874
Daughter? Nerissa never
had a daughter.

1662
01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.076
(gasps)

1663
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.377
Ruby.

1664
01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:29.446
*

1665
01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.161
*

1666
01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.164
(water rushing)

1667
01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.172

1668
01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.647

1669
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.782
*

1670
01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:12.989
We did it.

1671
01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:18.628
I've waited 15 years for this.

1672
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:24.401
15 years of waiting to get
revenge on your mother...

1673
01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.435
What?

1674
01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.504
...dethrone your grandmother

1675
01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.474
and lay waste
to the kraken kingdom.

1676
01:08:30.507 --> 01:08:31.775
Chelsea?

1677
01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:34.911
(chuckles)
Oh. there is no Chelsea.

1678
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:39.015
I am Nerissa.

1679
01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.784
What's...
What's happening to you?

1680
01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:42.819
Surprised?

1681
01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.854
(as Chelsea):
I'm a flippin' mermaid.

1682
01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.623
-(grunts)
-(Ruby screams)

1683
01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.493
NERISSA: And you're just
a dumb teenager.

1684
01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:55.131
All that rah-rah-rah
was so that you could free this

1685
01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:56.866
for me. me. me.

1686
01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.303
(as Chelsea):
My super sea-girl bestie.

1687
01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:00.937
I trusted you.

1688
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.973
You just got played. dum-dum.

01:10:31.295 --> 01:10:32.896
Hello?

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:34.798
Is Mrs. Gillman home?

1717
01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.267
Knock. knock!

1718
01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:39.603
Hey! That house was in escrow!

1719
01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.605
-WOMAN: Run! Run!
-To the boat. Davey.

1720
01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.239
There's kraken to kill.

1721
01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.608
-Wait!
-Gillman.

1722
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.242
Are you here to help me
kill the monsters?

1723
01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:48.478
-No. That's my wife.
-What?

1724
01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:51.581
But if she is a...
and-and you're her...

1725
01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.550
that means...

1726
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.586
Please don't kill me.
kraken monster.

1727
01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.121
Pull yourself together. man.

1728
01:10:58.154 --> 01:10:59.589
We've got a mermaid to hunt.

1729
01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.791
Thanks. I needed that.

1730
01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:03.793
Where is my daughter?

1731
01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:05.662
Oh. we already said
our goodbyes.

1732
01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:09.733
But not before
she gave me this.

1733
01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.101
(Nerissa laughing)

1734
01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:14.404
The greatest warrior
in the sea.

hiding amongst humans.

1736
01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:18.207
What a waste.

1737
01:11:19.343 --> 01:11:22.111
No one talks to my daughter
like that.

-Except me.
-(Agatha sighs)

1739
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.015
You've grown older. Queen.

1740
01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.284
Older and meaner.

1741
01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.287
Lucky for me.
mermaids don't age.

1742
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:34.290
Well. I hope you both put up
more of a fight than Ruby.

1743
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:36.560
(all yelling)

1744
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.465
Ruby? Ruby?

1745
01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.167
(Ruby crying. sniffling)

1746
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.035
Ruby!

1747
01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.138
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here...

1748
01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:51.140
(straining):
...slowly.

1749
01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:53.543
I will get you out
of here slowly.

1750
01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.481
Oh. no.

1751
01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:00.016
-What happened?
-(Ruby sighs)

1752
01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.886
Getting the Trident was
supposed to make things better.

1753
01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:05.321
but all I did
was ruin everything.

1754
01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:07.323
My mom was right.

1755
01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:09.959
I should have just gone home
like she said... (sniffles)

1756
01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.029
...gone back to hiding
and stayed small.

1757
01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:15.732
What? No. Ruby.
that's not what your mom meant.

1758
01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.233
I promise.

1759
01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.868
You weren't there.

1760
01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.670
Well. I may not know a lot
about a lot.

1761
01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:22.472
but I know my sister.

1762
01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:25.375
Growing up. I was so proud
to be her brother.

1763
01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:27.644
She was powerful. confident.

1764
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.245
Everyone loved her.

1765
01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.681
But then she left.

1766
01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.182
and I could never understand

1767
01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:35.685
why she chose to leave
the ocean

1768
01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:39.556
until I saw the awesome life
she created on land.

1769
01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:43.960
And I realized.
your mom chose her own path.

1770
01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:47.230
She chose you.

1771
01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.233
*

1772
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:55.805
(rumbling)

1773
01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.048
(rumbling)

1774
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.118
*

1775
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.696
It's time to destroy
that Trident once and for all.

1776
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.965
Yeah! Go get her. kiddo!

1777
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.435
-(whoosh)
-Whoa!

1778
01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.842
I'll be right there.

1779
01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.013
Don't wait up. though.

1780
01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:42.151
(yelps. grunts)

1781
01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.653
-(Grandmamah grunts)
-(crackling)

1782
01:13:43.687 --> 01:13:45.254
(Nerissa yells)

1783
01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.656
-(Agatha grunts)
-(crackling)

1784
01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:49.158
(laughing): Oh. it feels
so good to be back.

1785
01:13:49.192 --> 01:13:50.794
And this time.

1786
01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:54.363
I'm getting rid of you
for good.

1787
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.002
Stay away from my mother!

1788
01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:01.237
Ruby Gillman?

1789
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.040
(gasps)
Pause. Rewind. Ruby?

1790
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.843
You should be dead.

1791
01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.444
Picture this.

1792
01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:12.448
Quirky girl fulfills destiny
by foiling fake friend!

1793
01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.083
-(Nerissa grunts)
-(students gasp)

1794
01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.586
* Believer

1795
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.988
* Took me over like a fever

1796
01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:22.792
* Caught you hiding
in the smoke... *

1797
01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.093
What is she doing?

1798
01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.029
Answering the call.

1799
01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.131
(Nerissa laughing)

1800
01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:30.366
(both grunting)

1801
01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:34.638
* Ooh

1802
01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:39.208
* Lay your red hand
on me. baby *

1803
01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:42.946
* Ooh. ooh

1804
01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.650
* As I go

1805
01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:49.352
*

1806
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.560
(students screaming)

1807
01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:58.862
(laughing)

1808
01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.063
Leave my sister alone.

1809
01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.065
(cries out)

1810
01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.867
(panting)

1811
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.636
Aw. yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

1812
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.405
Doug. that's our house.

1813
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.444
Enough with these
childish games.

1814
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.148
I hate high school.

1815
01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.017
(Ruby cries out)

1816
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.686
(students screaming)

1817
01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:27.090
If this is our end.
then we'll face it unafraid!

1818
01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.758
(whistles blowing)

1819
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.894
* Into the sea

1820
01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.897
* Out of fire

1821
01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:37.601
* All that burning

1822
01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:40.036
* Into the sea

1823
01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.105
* Out of fire

1824
01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.942
* All that burning

1825
01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.044
-* Into the sea
-(straining)

1826
01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:50.179
* Out of fire

1827
01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.949
* All that burning...

1828
01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:56.452
(cheering)

1829
01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.256
-Ruby. behind you!
-(Nerissa yells)

1830
01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:04.427
You'll never win. Ruby Gillman.

1831
01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.031
You're just a dumb teenager.

1832
01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.767
You know what's really pathetic?

1833
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.736
That you thought someone like me

1834
01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:16.606
could ever be friends
with a monster like you.

1835
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.308
I am not a monster.

1836
01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:20.610
I'm a kraken.

1837
01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.955
Mom. we need to shoot
the Trident together.

1838
01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:33.757
No. it-it can't be destroyed.

1839
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.324
That's... that's why I hid it.

1840
01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.127
We can do it if we join together
at the same time.

1841
01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:40.897
It's the exponential
growth formula.

1842
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.432
We've got to shoot it more
and longer.

1843
01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:45.401
Trust me. I'm a mathlete.

1844
01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.971
(Nerissa yelling)

1845
01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:50.306
(grunting)

1846
01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.482
It doesn't have to end
like this.

1847
01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:01.785
Just give up the Trident.

1848
01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:04.320
You'll never get this
away from me.

1849
01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:07.791
Maybe I can't. but we can.

1850
01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.593
(gasps. grunts)

1851
01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.062
*

1852
01:17:17.801 --> 01:17:19.836
(straining)

1853
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.344
-(gasps) No!
-(lasers warbling)

1854
01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.679
(explosion)

1855
01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:31.314
(exclaiming)

1856
01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.449
(whooshing)

1857
01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:34.617
(screaming)

1858
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.286
*

1859
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.355
(people cheering)

1860
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.793
-Woo-hoo!
-(laughing)

1861
01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:45.795
(chittering happily)

1862
01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:46.696
MARGOT:
Go. Ruby!

1863
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.264
(Nerissa screaming)

1864
01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:51.534
Woo-hoo!

1865
01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:54.670
Now. that's a successful
monster hunt.

1866
01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:56.806
We got us
a little mermaid. Davey!

1867
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.174
Please. Please. please. please.

1868
01:17:58.207 --> 01:17:59.876
I'm not evil.

1869
01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.878
I'm just pretty...

1870
01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:03.546
and misunderstood.

1871
01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:05.314
(screams)

1872
01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.316
Now. what about the mermaid?

1873
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:10.019
-Everyone likes fried fish.
-No.

1874
01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.587
Away. rage.

1875
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.422
Teenagers.

1876
01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.291
Away. rage.

1877
01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.695
Ruby. I'm sorry.

1878
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:21.164
I was wrong.

1879
01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.233
I should have trusted you
with the truth.

1880
01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:27.236
and so from now on.
no more lying.

1881
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.572
And no more hiding.

1882
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.880
I think you can still make
the last dance.

1883
01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:45.621
Now. let's talk about
her coronation.

1884
01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:47.556
Mom. don't start.

1885
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.960
Fine. A mother knows best.

1886
01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:52.295
(gasps)

1887
01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.596
Brill's here.

1888
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:55.965
Mamah! What are you doing here?

1889
01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:57.366
And with Agatha?

1890
01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.734
Are-are... are you okay?
Is everyone okay?

1891
01:18:58.768 --> 01:18:59.903
-(Grandmamah shushing)
-Is Ruby okay?

1892
01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:02.738
It's Brill's time now.

1893
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.242
Oh.

1894
01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:09.779
I've waited 15 years for this.

1895
01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:12.115
Oh. who's crying?

1896
01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:15.651
You're crying. (crying)

1897
01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.655
*

1898
01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.803
(applause. cheering)

1899
01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:35.638
GIRL:
You're our hero.

1900
01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:37.406
(excited chattering)

1901
01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.108
I love you so much!

1902
01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.583
-BOY: Yeah!
-BOY 2: Ruby for prom queen.

1903
01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.185
GIRL:
You really saved us.

1904
01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.821
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
everything sooner.

1905
01:19:51.855 --> 01:19:53.656
and I'm sorry for ditching you.

1906
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:55.291
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1907
01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.794
Ruby. my sweet. magnificent.
giant-sized best friend.

1908
01:19:58.828 --> 01:20:01.597
you never ever have to hide
things from us.

1909
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.867
Yeah. we will always
be by your side.

1910
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.203
even when you almost
ended life as we know it.

1911
01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:09.038
Sorry. no catastrophizing.

1912
01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:12.141
Kraken. Canadian or otherwise.
we'll always love you. Rubes.

1913
01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:14.610
Squad solidarity?

1914
01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.612
ALL:
Squad solidarity.

1915
01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.681
(laughing)

1916
01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:24.888
Hey. you.

1917
01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:27.290
Ruby. H-Hey.

1918
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.392
So. that was you out there?

1919
01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.394
Guilty. (laughs nervously)

1920
01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:33.329
-Connor...
-Ruby... Oh. you go.

1921
01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:34.830
