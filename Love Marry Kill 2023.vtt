3
00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:18.689
I've got woman.
a victim of a hit-and-run.

4
00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:22.586
Struck by a car in a
residential area. Unconscious.

5
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.827
Blood pressure dropping.

6
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.310
Possible femur fracture.

7
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.517
Belly's distended.
possible internal bleeding.

8
00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.793
See if she was too quiet.
I'll blame you.

9
00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.827
-Take it easy.
-Is she responding to anything?

10
00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:34.000
-No response.
-Last blood pressure reading?

11
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.689
Joey took her last pressure
reading in the rig. 72 over 30.

12
00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:38.689
Okay we're probably going
to have to intubate.

13
00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:40.827
I'll grab the airway kit and
have someone call respiratory.

14
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.068
Right away.

15
00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:46.827
Elisha! Baby. baby. baby.
No. no. no!

16
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.103
Elisha!

17
00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:49.482
Baby. baby. baby. no. no. no!

18
00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:51.896
-No. no. no!
-I need another doctor now!

19
00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.068
Elisha!

20
00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:05.965
Gimme two.

21
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.827
Just one for me.

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.206
All in. Thomas.

23
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:26.724
I'm really regretting we didn't
play strip poker instead.

24
00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:32.724
I'll call.

25
00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:39.310
Then you'd be leaving
butt ass naked.

26
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:44.931
God!

27
00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:48.551
Gotta get to work.
Dead bodies wait for no woman.

28
00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:51.655
Okay. Jordan. at least tell me
why you won't go out with me.

29
00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.379
Thomas. you're a forensics
profiler at Quantico.

30
00:01:57.413 --> 00:01:59.034
You haven't figured that out
by now?

31
00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.931
I can't believe that
you were the keynote speaker

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.758
for the Forensic Pathologists
Conference yesterday

33
00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:07.724
and then proceeded to wipe us
all out in marathon rounds

34
00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.620
of five card draw.

35
00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:12.137
You're unbelievable.
you know that.

36
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.482
Who better to fleece
than a conference

37
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:15.068
full of arrogant doctors
and data nerds

38
00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:18.137
who tried to grab the keynote
speaker's ass all week?

39
00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:20.000
TouchÃ©. Dr. Touissant.

40
00:02:20.103 --> 00:02:24.482
but at least in my defense.
it is a very cute ass.

41
00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:26.965
I'm just wondering when I'm
gonna get you back in my bed?

42
00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:28.482
Thomas...

43
00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:33.310
you have a special set of skills
that I'm quite fond of.

44
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.206
And we had fun for a couple of
months. But that's all it was.

45
00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:41.206
Just give us a chance.

46
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.724
We agreed that we're better off
as cordial colleagues

47
00:02:45.793 --> 00:02:48.379
and rival poker players.

48
00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:53.827
Although. you're not really
a rival anymore.

49
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:56.620
After last night.
you're more like a mark.

50
00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.931
Oh. damn!

51
00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:02.172
That's vicious. you're vicious.

52
00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:03.862
I gotta take this.

53
00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay. When I finished.
all right?

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.931
Hello. it's Dr. Touissant.

55
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.689
Jordan. it's Tamera.

56
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.551
Tamera?

57
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.517
Jordan. you need to come home.

58
00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:21.758
-It's Elisha...
-What?

59
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.241
She's dead.

60
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.344
What?

61
00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:57.344
This is so surreal.

62
00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.241
I-I can't believe she's gone.

63
00:04:02.103 --> 00:04:03.551
Did you catch the driver?

64
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.758
Um. sorry. Doc. I don't have
any updates just yet.

65
00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:08.448
Mrs. Harrington
and Dr. Harrington.

66
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.758
I just wanted to come by

67
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:13.413
and extend my sincere
condolences on behalf of myself

68
00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:15.275
and the entire New Orleans
Police Department.

69
00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.931
Thank you. Chief Lewellyn.

70
00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:21.724
Miles. baby. would you
excuse us for a moment?

71
00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:23.931
-Okay.
-I love you. baby.

72
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:35.931
Police chief at a repast?

73
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.344
What do you think
that was about?

74
00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:38.862
Oh. it's been a week.

75
00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:41.034
The police still haven't caught
the hit-and-run driver

76
00:04:41.103 --> 00:04:42.931
that killed Elisha.

77
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.655
And I so imagine

78
00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:46.931
Mrs. Brenda Grace Harrington...

79
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.448
she is putting her
Louboutin firmly

80
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:51.551
in the chief's
grits-and-gravy ass.

81
00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:53.413
Do they have any leads?

82
00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:56.103
It's like Elisha
was hit by a ghost.

83
00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:57.862
Who found her?

84
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.241
A neighbor.
out walking his dog.

85
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:02.724
found her on the side
of the road.

86
00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.482
Where was Miles?

87
00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:08.068
At the hospital.

88
00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:11.379
Isn't he the
emergency room chief?

89
00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:14.517
Why was he there that late?

90
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.000
I don't know. Earl called
for an ambulance

91
00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.172
as soon as he found her.

92
00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:22.137
Girl. with this zip code. they
came in a matter of minutes.

93
00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:26.655
But by the time they got her
to the hospital. they just...

94
00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:29.827
couldn't do nothing for her.

95
00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:36.827
I thought you quit?

96
00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:39.931
Haven't touched one
since Bill died.

97
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.517
I thought you quit?

98
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.689
My liver quit a long time ago.

99
00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:55.172
That's why I only drink
on Tuesdays and Thursdays

100
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:56.827
and when the Saints lose.

101
00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:00.689
He's a good man.
Bill Harrington.

102
00:06:00.724 --> 00:06:02.482
Made a damn fine whiskey.

103
00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.724
Yes.

104
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.965
Yes. he did.

105
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:10.241
But unlike my
family's bourbon...

106
00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:11.827
Bill was weak.

107
00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.724
Didn't have the balls
to do the things

108
00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:17.551
that needed to be done
to protect his family.

109
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.724
Well. lucky for me...

110
00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:28.965
I got balls bigger
than the state of Louisiana.

111
00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:31.827
That you do. Mrs. Harrington.
That you do.

112
00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:37.793
Now. Chief...

113
00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:41.793
how big are your balls?

114
00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:44.068
Whoa. Brenda Grace!
What the hell...

115
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.724
Tell me. Chief.

116
00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:52.793
What's going on
with the investigation

117
00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:54.758
into my daughter-in-law's death?

118
00:06:54.827 --> 00:06:57.379
I told you. we're working
around the clock...

119
00:06:57.413 --> 00:07:00.620
and we won't rest until
the driver of that car is found.

120
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.137
If you want to stay chief.

121
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:13.758
you'll see to it that your
good ol' boys do their jobs.

122
00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:16.137
You will not be
city's dog catcher

123
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:19.793
if my poor son doesn't
get justice very soon

124
00:07:19.827 --> 00:07:23.965
for his beloved wife.
God rest her soul.

125
00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:38.103
Yes. ma'am.

126
00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:40.413
-I'm gonna need that dress.
-Say less. sis.

127
00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:41.758
That's yours.

128
00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:43.448
Matter of fact. I was making

129
00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:44.965
Elisha and Brenda Grace's gowns

130
00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:47.620
for the Grand Boule gala
this year.

131
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:50.793
Yes. come through New Orleans
haute couture

132
00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:53.034
for the grand dame
of the Grand Boule.

133
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.482
Your girl went from the bottom
to the Boule

134
00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:58.620
just in time for my birthday.

135
00:08:00.137 --> 00:08:03.103
Although it won't
be a happy one this year.

136
00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:04.586
That's right.

137
00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:07.310
It is almost your birthday.

138
00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:11.586
Well... we're gonna
celebrate any way.

139
00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:15.000
It's what Elisha
would've wanted.

140
00:08:15.034 --> 00:08:16.689
Yeah. I guess you're right.

141
00:08:16.724 --> 00:08:20.310
I feel like I owe you and Elisha
an apology.

142
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.862
Why would you need
to apologize to us?

143
00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:30.137
When my mom lost her
battle at cancer...

144
00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:34.379
I was drowning in grief.

145
00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.000
And when that job offer from DC

146
00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:39.034
to be the City's
Medical Examiner came in.

147
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:40.862
I...

148
00:08:40.896 --> 00:08:43.310
I grabbed on to it
like it was a life preserver

149
00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.310
I just threw myself into work.

150
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.103
I mean. I kept up with you
on social media.

151
00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:52.379
I saw you killing
at fashion game.

152
00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:56.689
and Elisha was... running her
family's foundation.

153
00:08:58.034 --> 00:09:00.724
She finally had
the family that...

154
00:09:00.793 --> 00:09:03.344
The perfect family
she always wanted.

155
00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:07.620
Elisha just missed you.
you know.

156
00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:10.000
-We both did.
-She called me.

157
00:09:11.344 --> 00:09:14.724
And. uh. I saw that
she called. but...

158
00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:16.241
I didn't call her back.

159
00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:19.206
What did she say?

160
00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:21.586
I listened to the message
on the plane on the way here

161
00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.793
and...

162
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.137
she sounded like she was worried
about something.

163
00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:29.275
Oh. you can't.

164
00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:32.068
You can't worry about
that now. I mean...

165
00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:34.379
Maybe she was stressed
about the Boule.

166
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:37.724
Brenda Grace want to make it
bigger and better every year.

167
00:09:37.758 --> 00:09:40.103
Kick off of the season.

168
00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:41.551
That would stress anybody out.
huh. girl?

169
00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.068
It didn't seem like
it was about work.

170
00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:53.137
Hey. Jordan. it-it's Elisha.

171
00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:57.172
Wow. I feel like I haven't
talked to you in forever.

172
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:00.448
Can you call me back
when you get this message?

173
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.379
I need some advice.

174
00:10:02.448 --> 00:10:05.448
You're the only one
I can trust right now.

175
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.241
Please. call me back.

176
00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:09.758
See?

177
00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:12.379
Doesn't it seem like
she was worried

178
00:10:12.448 --> 00:10:14.068
about something serious?

179
00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:19.275
-I don't--
-Tamera.

180
00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:22.241
Mother would like to speak
with you about the Grand Boule.

181
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.758
Sure. Miles.

182
00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:32.000
Love you.

183
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:51.758
That Harrington bitch
is on my ass

184
00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:53.344
like a gator in chicken coop.

185
00:10:53.413 --> 00:10:55.241
So that means I'm on yours.

186
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.448
Here.

187
00:10:57.517 --> 00:11:00.758
Spread that around and find the
driver of that car. you hear?

188
00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:16.000
Coming!

189
00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:25.965
Oh. my God! I totally forgot
you're coming today.

190
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.172
Um...

191
00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:33.000
You know. I haven't decided what
I'm gonna keep for staging.

192
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:36.137
But. you know. you guys
can just come on in.

193
00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:46.655
You know what. why don't
you guys start upstairs

194
00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:47.827
and I'll just meet you
in a second?

195
00:11:50.862 --> 00:11:52.620
Hey. morning. beautiful.
Just checking on you.

196
00:11:52.655 --> 00:11:54.241
How was the service?

197
00:11:55.586 --> 00:11:58.448
Elisha's homegoing was lovely.

198
00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:02.586
But they still haven't caught
the driver that killed Elisha.

199
00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.517
What are the police saying?

200
00:12:04.551 --> 00:12:05.724
Not enough.

201
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.482
Can you hold on a second?

202
00:12:10.137 --> 00:12:12.586
My officers are pursuing
several leads.

203
00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:14.413
The New Orleans police
department will not rest

204
00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:17.275
until this callous killer
is brought to justice.

205
00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.413
Look. I'm sorry to bother you
so early.

206
00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:23.724
but I need to confirm if you're
coming to Quantico on Monday.

207
00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:25.551
You're supposed to be giving
your Racial Bias

208
00:12:25.586 --> 00:12:27.793
in Forensic Pathology
and Criminal Testimony talk

209
00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:29.517
to the new class of agents.

210
00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:33.379
And they're excited to meet
DC's chief medical examiner.

211
00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:34.862
-Monday?
-Yeah.

212
00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:36.068
You're still planning
on coming back

213
00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:37.793
at the end of the week. right?

214
00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:42.379
Yes. I. um. I just forgot.

215
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:45.793
Hey. it's okay. I know you got a
lot on your mind right now.

216
00:12:45.862 --> 00:12:47.310
Yeah.

217
00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:50.689
In addition to processing
Elisha's death.

218
00:12:50.758 --> 00:12:55.344
I am trying to deal with my
parent's town home.

219
00:12:55.413 --> 00:12:57.413
The people that I hired
to get it ready

220
00:12:57.482 --> 00:12:58.551
are actually here.

221
00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:00.103
Right now.

222
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:03.482
Jordan. will you please let me
know if you need any help?

223
00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.310
You need not have to do this
all on your own.

224
00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:08.137
I can be there
in a New Orleans minute.

225
00:13:08.206 --> 00:13:10.034
Yeah. thank you.
I appreciate you.

226
00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:11.586
No problem. precious.

227
00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:13.965
I'm sorry about that.

228
00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:16.517
Um. where should we start?

229
00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:25.448
-I don't know what to say.
-Just say. "Yes."

230
00:13:25.482 --> 00:13:29.206
It would mean so much to me
and. frankly. Miles.

231
00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:32.448
And I think that's what your
dear mother would want also.

232
00:13:34.034 --> 00:13:37.206
How I so miss
Claire's friendship.

233
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.379
It's just that I was scheduled
to leave on Friday.

234
00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:42.965
Well. surely you can extend
your stay in New Orleans.

235
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.793
for your mother's dearest
and oldest friend.

236
00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:50.103
And besides. Jordan.
it's for Elisha.

237
00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:55.137
Of course I can extend
my stay.

238
00:13:55.206 --> 00:13:56.965
I-I would be honored.

239
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.275
Oh. bless your heart. Jordan.

240
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.241
But this calls for a toast.

241
00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:06.275
Cheers to the Grand Boule.

242
00:14:07.758 --> 00:14:09.344
To the Boule.

243
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.172
Oh. well. looky here!

244
00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:27.517
If it isn't Jordan Touissant.
as I live and breathe.

245
00:14:27.586 --> 00:14:29.034
Oh!

246
00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.344
Sully. you know
I couldn't come home

247
00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:32.275
without stopping by this office.

248
00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:35.448
And is that box of beignets
a gift for your old boss?

249
00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:38.137
Mm-hm. only the
best from Filene's

250
00:14:38.206 --> 00:14:40.448
for the man that gave
this college student

251
00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:44.551
the internship of a lifetime.
and a job after graduation.

252
00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:47.862
Well. you remember. you wouldn't
stop hanging around.

253
00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:49.344
I had to give you a job

254
00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:51.379
to stop Esther from thinking
I was having an affair.

255
00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:54.034
Please give Esther my best

256
00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:55.862
and tell her
I still miss her jambalaya.

257
00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:58.758
I certainly will do that.

258
00:14:58.827 --> 00:15:01.620
So. how's DC treating you?

259
00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:06.241
It's good. you know. busy.

260
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.758
I hear a "but" in your voice.

261
00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:12.724
Is the beltway not all that you
thought it would be?

262
00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:16.551
Uh. it's not that...

263
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.758
But I guess
it's just not New Orleans.

264
00:15:18.827 --> 00:15:20.517
Doesn't feel like home yet.

265
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:24.620
Well. after 30 years
with Esther.

266
00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:28.758
I can tell you from experience
until you find someone special

267
00:15:28.862 --> 00:15:30.413
it never will be.

268
00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:33.896
And what makes you think
I haven't found someone special?

269
00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:36.724
There's no ring on that finger.

270
00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:40.275
You know. in addition
to my career in DC.

271
00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:41.793
I have you to thank

272
00:15:41.862 --> 00:15:44.758
for my repertoire of forensic
pathologist jokes.

273
00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:46.620
I kill at conferences.

274
00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:49.896
Do you know why the best
forensic teams can never catch

275
00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:51.482
hillbilly criminals?

276
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:52.551
Why. Sully?

277
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.275
'Cause they all share
the same DNA

278
00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:57.241
and there ain't no
doggone dental records.

279
00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:03.310
Don't quit your day job
for a. you know. open-mic night.

280
00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:06.310
I cannot wait
to have these after lunch.

281
00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:08.172
I brought you some napkins too.

282
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:10.241
Oh. thank you so much now.

283
00:16:14.448 --> 00:16:15.965
Is that Elisha's autopsy?

284
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.965
Don't.. I-I'm sorry. That..

285
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.793
That...
Sorry. it shouldn't be out.

286
00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:23.482
Can I see it?

287
00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:25.379
Are you sure you want to do
that to yourself?

288
00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:29.000
I know how close
the two of you were.

289
00:16:29.103 --> 00:16:30.724
This just breaks my heart.

290
00:16:32.413 --> 00:16:37.344
I'll always regret not seeing
her one last time.

291
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.482
Excuse me. one second.

292
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:43.000
Sully Dufresne.

293
00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:44.482
Yes.

294
00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:47.379
Already?

295
00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:51.551
All right.
Okay. I'll be right out.

296
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.689
-Got a body?
-Yes.

297
00:16:56.793 --> 00:17:01.034
And the lift gate's acting up.
so I gotta go out and open it.

298
00:17:01.068 --> 00:17:02.724
Don't you touch my beignets.

299
00:17:02.793 --> 00:17:04.379
Uh. never.

300
00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:15.655
Oh. my God!

301
00:17:50.482 --> 00:17:52.724
You want my arm to fall off?

302
00:17:52.793 --> 00:17:54.379
What are you doing here?

303
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.551
You didn't answer my question.

304
00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.896
"Do you want my arm
to fall off?"

305
00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:02.551
You're no Billie Dee Williams.

306
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.482
Well. you ain't no Diana Ross

307
00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:07.275
from what I can remember after
some of our karaoke nights.

308
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.793
but I won't hold
that against you.

309
00:18:13.103 --> 00:18:15.275
But you're still...

310
00:18:17.448 --> 00:18:19.310
just as beautiful.

311
00:18:19.379 --> 00:18:21.379
-Marcus?
-Mm-hm?

312
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:23.103
What are you doing here?

313
00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:24.448
I saw you watching us
at the funeral.

314
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:25.965
Are you stalking me now?

315
00:18:28.827 --> 00:18:31.758
Wow! Someone has developed a
mighty high opinion

316
00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:34.655
of themselves
after breaking up with me

317
00:18:34.724 --> 00:18:37.965
and moving all the way to DC
for their fancy new job.

318
00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:40.896
Hm.

319
00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:43.655
And I see you made detective.

320
00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:47.379
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

321
00:18:47.448 --> 00:18:49.482
Good afternoon.
Detective Bardot.

322
00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:52.000
-Afternoon. Dr. Dufresne.
-Oh. Sully. please.

323
00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:54.793
There's no room for formalities
amongst the dead.

324
00:18:57.172 --> 00:19:00.103
I just came to get the medical
examiner's official report

325
00:19:00.137 --> 00:19:02.551
on the Elisha Harrington case.

326
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.034
You could've called.
I would've emailed them

327
00:19:04.137 --> 00:19:05.689
over to your office.

328
00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:08.379
I just want to make sure
I got everything for the chief.

329
00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:09.896
You know. high profile case.

330
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.275
so we gotta make sure
we review every single detail

331
00:19:13.344 --> 00:19:14.620
to find that good old driver.

332
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:16.620
-Okay.
-So. can I have the photos?

333
00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:18.379
-That would be fine?
-Oh. um...

334
00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:20.344
Well. these aren't those photos.

335
00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:23.517
They. um. got mixed up
in this other file.

336
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:25.689
Organizational skills
have lapsed

337
00:19:25.724 --> 00:19:29.448
ever since Delilah went out
on maternity leave.

338
00:19:29.517 --> 00:19:31.620
You'd think five kids
was enough.

339
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:34.862
You know. I had to go to HR
after I said to her.

340
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.586
"Five kid's not a family.
it's litter."

341
00:19:41.689 --> 00:19:44.034
Well. you don't have another set
in the photo?

342
00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:47.551
If not. after your thing.
go ahead and print me some more.

343
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.931
I can do better for you.
detective.

344
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.344
Thank you.

345
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:54.034
My. uh. lab printer
is not working.

346
00:19:54.103 --> 00:19:56.586
And the city won't buy me
another one. so...

347
00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:00.206
I had to print 'em
down the hall.

348
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.793
All right. so.
I'll just grab 'em...

349
00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:07.448
and I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

350
00:20:16.068 --> 00:20:19.689
I'm really sorry. uh.
for what happened to Elisha.

351
00:20:21.172 --> 00:20:22.689
Thank you.

352
00:20:24.482 --> 00:20:26.448
So. how long are you in town?

353
00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:32.310
I was supposed to leave
on Friday. but. um...

354
00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:36.275
Elisha's mom asked me to stick
around for the Grand Boule.

355
00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:38.551
-So...
-The Grand Boule.

356
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.896
So. does that ticket still
come with a paper bag test?

357
00:20:40.965 --> 00:20:43.517
You know
they don't do that anymore.

358
00:20:43.586 --> 00:20:44.862
Okay. you're there.

359
00:20:44.965 --> 00:20:47.517
-Here you go. Detective.
-Oh. thank you.

360
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.862
Mm-hm.

361
00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:51.793
Marcus. do you mind giving me
a ride home?

362
00:20:53.137 --> 00:20:54.551
Sure. Sure. sure. sure.

363
00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.517
I was hoping we gonna
continue our visit.

364
00:20:56.551 --> 00:20:59.137
I know. I just.
I just remembered.

365
00:20:59.206 --> 00:21:01.793
I have the plumber coming
to look at a leaky pipe.

366
00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:04.413
Well. you check in with me
before you leave. darlin'.

367
00:21:04.448 --> 00:21:06.586
Aw. you know I will.

368
00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:08.344
-All right.
-Okay.

369
00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:10.413
-See you. dear.
-Take care.

370
00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:13.379
Sully.

371
00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:19.241
Come on. got 'em in here. My
car's parked around the corner.

372
00:21:19.275 --> 00:21:21.068
Jordan. hey.
what are you doing?

373
00:21:21.103 --> 00:21:23.862
Stop. Jordan. Get...
Jordan.

374
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:27.275
There's a photo missing.

375
00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:30.034
What photo. Jordan?

376
00:21:30.103 --> 00:21:32.379
The photo that shows
that Elisha was strangled.

377
00:21:42.448 --> 00:21:44.931
I don't know.
what do we have here?

378
00:21:46.344 --> 00:21:48.172
Oh. my God!

379
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:49.827
Just stop.

380
00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:53.000
It was in the cushion.

381
00:21:53.068 --> 00:21:54.758
I fell asleep
on the couch last night.

382
00:21:54.793 --> 00:21:57.931
That's okay. You know I always
loved you in lingerie.

383
00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:02.931
My lingerie habits stopped being
your concern five years ago.

384
00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:06.413
Not 'cause I wanted it to.

385
00:22:16.103 --> 00:22:17.482
Look.

386
00:22:18.862 --> 00:22:20.689
We need to figure out
why Sully's hiding

387
00:22:20.793 --> 00:22:23.000
the photo that shows
that Elisha was strangled.

388
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.827
Hm.

389
00:22:28.482 --> 00:22:31.310
Are those the pictures
that you took?

390
00:22:31.344 --> 00:22:32.931
-Yes.
-And the missing photo?

391
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.931
And those photos.
and that voicemail

392
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.482
I played for you in the car
from Elisha.

393
00:22:37.517 --> 00:22:40.000
has all my Spidey
senses tingling.

394
00:22:42.103 --> 00:22:43.827
Something's not right.

395
00:22:46.689 --> 00:22:50.103
Strangulation doesn't
really make sense.

396
00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:53.965
When the EMTs got to Elisha.
she was still alive.

397
00:22:54.034 --> 00:22:56.862
She didn't die until after
she got to the hospital.

398
00:22:56.931 --> 00:22:59.862
And Elisha was examined by
her loving husband

399
00:22:59.965 --> 00:23:03.206
who just happened to be working
at the hospital that night.

400
00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:05.689
Pretty convenient alibi. huh?

401
00:23:05.724 --> 00:23:07.000
So. what. are you trying to say

402
00:23:07.068 --> 00:23:09.068
that Dr. Miles Harrington
killed his wife?

403
00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:11.344
Fifty-five percent of
female homicide victims

404
00:23:11.413 --> 00:23:15.896
are killed by an intimate
partner. husbands or boyfriends.

405
00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:19.655
Isn't the husband
always the first suspect?

406
00:23:20.793 --> 00:23:22.896
Not when you're a Harrington.

407
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:25.000
Off the rip. the Police Chief
was real adamant

408
00:23:25.068 --> 00:23:27.620
that we pursue
a hit-and-run driver.

409
00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:30.827
Miles was never even questioned.

410
00:23:30.896 --> 00:23:34.724
Did NOLA PD even check
his timeline for the night?

411
00:23:34.758 --> 00:23:36.724
According to the hospital
key card.

412
00:23:36.758 --> 00:23:39.068
that Miles Harrington was
conveniently at the hospital

413
00:23:39.172 --> 00:23:40.724
at that time that
Elisha was murdered.

414
00:23:40.793 --> 00:23:42.724
-The key card.
-Mm-hm.

415
00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:46.413
Did any person
actually see him there

416
00:23:46.482 --> 00:23:48.379
before his wife arrived?

417
00:23:48.413 --> 00:23:51.379
I'll follow up tomorrow
and I can check.

418
00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:55.172
But if Elisha was strangled.

419
00:23:55.241 --> 00:23:56.586
then how was she still alive

420
00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:59.448
when she got to the hospital.
Dr. Touissant?

421
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:03.103
Okay. detective.

422
00:24:04.275 --> 00:24:06.517
Look. Give me your hands.

423
00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:11.206
Now...

424
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:12.862
As you apply pressure.

425
00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:15.034
the victim will
lose consciousness.

426
00:24:15.103 --> 00:24:18.793
Depending on the amount of time
without oxygen.

427
00:24:18.827 --> 00:24:22.586
there could be permanent
medical consequences.

428
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.689
Stroke or brain damage

429
00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:26.931
and obviously death.

430
00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:29.620
I think Elisha's attacker
was interrupted

431
00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:31.620
before he could finish the job.

432
00:24:33.448 --> 00:24:35.793
Why does it always
have to be a he?

433
00:24:35.827 --> 00:24:38.965
Well. without looking
at the body. I can't be sure.

434
00:24:39.034 --> 00:24:41.827
but judging from these photos.

435
00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:46.103
I would bet this townhouse
that her attacker was a man.

436
00:24:51.137 --> 00:24:54.000
Seems like you're enjoying your
job a little bit too much.

437
00:24:55.896 --> 00:24:57.034
Hardly.

438
00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:04.103
So... are you really going
to sell this place?

439
00:25:05.827 --> 00:25:08.000
It's time.

440
00:25:08.034 --> 00:25:11.172
-Hm.
-I'm never here anymore anyway.

441
00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:13.137
Yeah. I'm trying to get it
on the market

442
00:25:13.206 --> 00:25:14.862
before I get back to DC.

443
00:25:14.965 --> 00:25:18.586
Well. I'm sorry to hear that.

444
00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:20.413
Why?

445
00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:22.896
Well. because...

446
00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:26.689
if you still own
this beautiful the place...

447
00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:31.000
there's a chance that you'd
come back to New Orleans.

448
00:25:32.758 --> 00:25:34.586
Back to me.

449
00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:38.206
âª Smiling on the surface

450
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:40.034
âª Deep down are
you feeling me âª

451
00:25:40.103 --> 00:25:43.517
âª Baby I'm strong enough âª

452
00:25:43.586 --> 00:25:45.275
We shouldn't do this.

453
00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:49.758
Enjoying the night. eh. now?

454
00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:53.379
I didn't realize
how much I missed you

455
00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:56.068
until I saw you at the cemetery.

456
00:26:07.275 --> 00:26:08.862
Marcus...

457
00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.103
The past is the past.

458
00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:14.758
Hm.

459
00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:17.413
Excuse me.

460
00:26:17.482 --> 00:26:19.275
Let me go...

461
00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:22.896
before you do something
that you will regret

462
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:25.827
in the morning to make up
to something.

463
00:26:29.413 --> 00:26:31.758
Good night. doctor.

464
00:26:47.241 --> 00:26:51.206
âª Baby I'm not strong enough

465
00:26:53.586 --> 00:26:55.275
Don't act like you
forgot something

466
00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:56.931
to try to get me into bed.

467
00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:59.000
Ugh!

468
00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:03.827
It's not happening.

469
00:27:08.448 --> 00:27:10.620
Mind if I come in?

470
00:27:10.655 --> 00:27:12.827
Um...

471
00:27:12.862 --> 00:27:14.482
I was actually
just about to go to bed.

472
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:16.206
Right. so I hear.

473
00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:21.413
I'm guessing you were expecting
somebody else. right?

474
00:27:23.344 --> 00:27:27.689
What can I do for you. Miles?
It's pretty late. You okay?

475
00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:32.137
Yeah. yeah. um. no. I just.
I just left the hospital.

476
00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.965
You're back at work already?

477
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.620
Yeah. yeah. you know. it's...

478
00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:40.241
It's the only thing that
you know quiets my brains

479
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.724
so I'm not thinking
about Elisha all day...

480
00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:46.379
and catching the bastard
who killed her.

481
00:27:48.068 --> 00:27:50.000
How's Amaya Grace?

482
00:27:55.344 --> 00:27:57.448
She's still asking when her
mommy's coming home.

483
00:27:58.586 --> 00:28:00.137
Um...

484
00:28:02.137 --> 00:28:04.689
I don't think she fully
understands what happened.

485
00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:07.482
I'm sorry. Miles. I...

486
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:08.724
I know that can't be easy.

487
00:28:08.827 --> 00:28:13.034
Elisha. she loved you so much.

488
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.793
You were her best friend. right?

489
00:28:17.724 --> 00:28:19.206
Yeah.

490
00:28:20.724 --> 00:28:23.448
Miles. have you been drinking?

491
00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:31.758
Yeah. it's. uh...

492
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:34.482
It's the only thing that gets me
through the lonely nights.

493
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:38.586
Tell you the truth. I can't even
sleep in my own bed right now.

494
00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:42.206
You really shouldn't be driving
if you've been drinking.

495
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:43.896
I just came to say thank you.
Jordan.

496
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.379
"Thank you?"

497
00:28:45.448 --> 00:28:46.724
For what?

498
00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:50.689
Mother told me that
you two had lunch at Gris Gris

499
00:28:50.758 --> 00:28:55.379
and that you agreed to be
the Grand Boule queen.

500
00:28:59.413 --> 00:29:03.103
I. I didn't realize you guys
had opened a restaurant.

501
00:29:03.137 --> 00:29:06.310
Elisha and I opened a
restaurant and lounge

502
00:29:06.413 --> 00:29:09.137
just-just last year. you know?

503
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:12.965
She... Man. she wanted something
that was just ours.

504
00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:15.448
wasn't tied to the family.

505
00:29:15.517 --> 00:29:17.310
Anything for Elisha.

506
00:29:17.379 --> 00:29:19.862
You know. hey. um.
I'll give you a call

507
00:29:19.931 --> 00:29:22.310
and we-we can talk about
the foundation

508
00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:25.034
'cause I know Elisha.
she was really. really proud

509
00:29:25.103 --> 00:29:26.862
of the Ninth Ward youth center.

510
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.275
-So--
-Sounds good.

511
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.931
I. I'll give you a call. Miles.

512
00:29:30.965 --> 00:29:33.965
-Okay?
-You call.

513
00:29:34.068 --> 00:29:35.620
You take care. Miles.

514
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:38.758
Okay.

515
00:29:38.793 --> 00:29:40.379
Yeah.

516
00:29:40.448 --> 00:29:42.965
-Get home safe.
-Thank you.

517
00:29:43.034 --> 00:29:45.034
-Bye. Jordan.
-Good night.

518
00:30:11.448 --> 00:30:14.482
I told you exactly who I need it
to be. Dayveon? You get it done.

519
00:30:14.586 --> 00:30:16.965
-You're making it complicated.
-I can't afford any mistakes.

520
00:30:17.034 --> 00:30:18.931
I got you.
you ain't gotta worry.

521
00:30:18.965 --> 00:30:20.275
I'm just saying.
what you got for me?

522
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.172
I ain't got shit for you. boy.

523
00:30:24.275 --> 00:30:26.275
-Hey.
-Hey. girl.

524
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.103
I didn't know you were gonna
stop by today.

525
00:30:29.206 --> 00:30:31.275
-I'll call you later.
-Oh.

526
00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:40.586
-Um. ahem. who that. girl?
-That's nobody.

527
00:30:40.655 --> 00:30:44.827
Hm. he looks like he wants
to be somebody's body.

528
00:30:44.931 --> 00:30:46.586
You were talking about me
needing the D. he looked like

529
00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:48.482
he wanted to give it to you.
right there on the desk.

530
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:50.758
Don't nobody got time for
these New Orleans dudes.

531
00:30:50.793 --> 00:30:52.103
They on some real clown shit.

532
00:30:52.137 --> 00:30:54.206
Like damn near wearing
a bear costume

533
00:30:54.275 --> 00:30:56.275
riding a unicycle and shit.

534
00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:57.586
No. ma'am.

535
00:30:58.862 --> 00:31:00.586
Ooh! What about Ashton's father?

536
00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:03.827
Hm. I haven't seen that fool
in over a year.

537
00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:06.724
See. try these guys out here
at your own risk.

538
00:31:06.793 --> 00:31:09.206
They should all come
with warning labels.

539
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.379
You did always love a man
who could play a horn.

540
00:31:11.448 --> 00:31:13.448
What did you say in college.
if he knows how to play a horn

541
00:31:13.517 --> 00:31:15.448
then he knows
how to use his lips.

542
00:31:15.517 --> 00:31:18.034
Yeah. shocker. a jazz trumpeter
as my baby daddy

543
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:21.344
isn't quite the windfall
I was promised. okay?

544
00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:25.689
Now. he's been ghost for most of
Ashton's life. but you know what

545
00:31:25.724 --> 00:31:28.344
my baby ain't never gonna go
without like I did.

546
00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:33.413
What's this?

547
00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:40.344
You're the Grand Boule queen?

548
00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:43.862
I thought you were going back
to DC?

549
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:46.517
I was planning to. but. uh...

550
00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:49.655
Then I had lunch with Brenda
Grace. and she pulled the whole

551
00:31:49.724 --> 00:31:53.655
"Claire's my oldest
and dearest friend" card

552
00:31:53.724 --> 00:31:57.517
and. well. guilted me
into staying another week.

553
00:31:57.551 --> 00:32:00.551
So. you're taking Elisha's place
as the Boule queen?

554
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.103
No. she just asked me to be
the honorary Boule queen

555
00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:05.793
and announce a grant

556
00:32:05.862 --> 00:32:07.896
that the Harrington Foundation
is giving to a youth center

557
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:09.448
in the Ninth Ward.

558
00:32:09.517 --> 00:32:11.862
Apparently.
that was the last thing

559
00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:13.448
that Elisha was working on.

560
00:32:13.551 --> 00:32:17.482
Yeah. I know. I was the one that
was helping her with the plans.

561
00:32:21.655 --> 00:32:25.724
Oh! Ti. I had no idea.

562
00:32:25.758 --> 00:32:28.103
Look. I'll talk to Brenda Grace.

563
00:32:28.206 --> 00:32:29.620
I mean. it really should be you

564
00:32:29.724 --> 00:32:31.896
since you were the one
helping Elisha.

565
00:32:31.965 --> 00:32:34.896
Brenda Grace would burn
that distillery to the ground

566
00:32:34.965 --> 00:32:38.000
before she let a girl from
the bottom represent her

567
00:32:38.068 --> 00:32:41.103
precious family
at the Grand Boule.

568
00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:45.103
Hey. sis. do not let her
get you down. okay?

569
00:32:45.137 --> 00:32:49.103
Look. I booked us into the spa
for your birthday tomorrow.

570
00:32:49.206 --> 00:32:52.551
So. it'll be you plus me equals

571
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.620
facials. massages
and bottomless mimosa brunch!

572
00:32:56.689 --> 00:33:00.241
Okay. that'll make me
feel little bit better.

573
00:33:00.275 --> 00:33:02.137
But drinks on me
tonight at Gris-Gris.

574
00:33:02.172 --> 00:33:04.172
-Yes.
-Yeah.

575
00:33:04.241 --> 00:33:05.551
Treat yourself
with a nice dress.

576
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.034
Of course.

577
00:33:09.551 --> 00:33:11.172
Love you.

578
00:33:21.896 --> 00:33:24.137
Miles. it's Tamera.
Again.

579
00:33:25.275 --> 00:33:27.896
Will you please call me back?

580
00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:29.137
We need to talk.

581
00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.413
God. I forgot my phone.

582
00:33:35.482 --> 00:33:36.862
Dayveon. what you thinking?

583
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:38.689
People can't keep seeing you
in here like this.

584
00:33:38.758 --> 00:33:40.172
What you worried about.
old girl?

585
00:33:40.275 --> 00:33:41.827
She don't even know me.
ya hear me?

586
00:33:41.896 --> 00:33:43.482
I ain't worried about Jordan.

587
00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:46.344
What I want to know is that you
can handle what we discussed.

588
00:33:46.413 --> 00:33:49.758
I got you. Ain't no problems.
Let me tell you.

589
00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:52.482
The Crowns running that shit.

590
00:33:52.517 --> 00:33:55.000
Hm. so you think you got me?

591
00:33:55.103 --> 00:33:57.724
Yeah. I do.

592
00:33:57.793 --> 00:33:59.172
You need not worry.

593
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.862
âª Congested âª

594
00:34:07.068 --> 00:34:08.862
âª Congested

595
00:34:11.068 --> 00:34:12.551
âª Congested

596
00:34:15.172 --> 00:34:16.655
âª Congested

597
00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:24.724
âª Congested

598
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.620
âª Congested

599
00:34:39.931 --> 00:34:41.965
Thanks for the photo.
The plates match.

600
00:34:42.034 --> 00:34:43.482
Get that son of a bitch.

601
00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:54.241
Okay. all right.
well. cheers to that.

602
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:55.896
You two got us
out of more trouble

603
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.724
than the number of drunks

604
00:34:57.758 --> 00:35:00.689
showing their asses on
a "COPS" marathon.

605
00:35:00.758 --> 00:35:02.758
I just know that
when I first met ya

606
00:35:02.827 --> 00:35:05.758
y'all you were two stuck up
New Orleans princesses.

607
00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:07.793
Y'all had never been through
half that stuff

608
00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:09.275
I went through as a kid.

609
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.448
I get it. but we knew

610
00:35:11.482 --> 00:35:12.931
you didn't like talking
about your childhood

611
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.448
and you never wanted us
to meet your aunt or uncle

612
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:16.965
and we respected that.

613
00:35:17.034 --> 00:35:20.448
Nevertheless. we ended up
ride-or-die besties.

614
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:25.310
Well. I just thank y'all two
for always having my back.

615
00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:27.965
-You know?
-Of course.

616
00:35:28.068 --> 00:35:29.724
I appreciate them.

617
00:35:29.793 --> 00:35:31.896
And silver spoon or not.

618
00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:34.793
Elisha. she was a real one.

619
00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:39.517
-To Elisha.
-To Elisha.

620
00:35:41.034 --> 00:35:43.344
Yeah? This place is so quiet.

621
00:35:44.931 --> 00:35:47.551
Hm! Don't look now.

622
00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.103
-What?
-Don't look. Damn it. girl!

623
00:35:49.137 --> 00:35:51.344
I said. "Don't." Damn.

624
00:35:54.275 --> 00:35:56.620
Who this woman. Harpo?

625
00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:59.793
That's his new boo.
Simone Russell.

626
00:35:59.862 --> 00:36:02.172
She in real estate.

627
00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:05.551
Them two've been hot and heavy
for about six months.

628
00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:09.379
Well. before your fat ass
sashayed into town.

629
00:36:09.482 --> 00:36:11.620
Well. a switching
you like to do.

630
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:24.379
Who is that?

631
00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:27.344
Um. that is...
Jordan Touissant.

632
00:36:27.379 --> 00:36:29.517
-She's--
-Girl. seeing you.

633
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:30.862
Well played. my friend.

634
00:36:30.965 --> 00:36:34.172
Girl. Ain't nobody thinking
about Marcus.

635
00:36:34.206 --> 00:36:36.206
Oooh. girl. come on!

636
00:36:36.275 --> 00:36:37.793
Hm-hm.

637
00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:27.137
Amaya Grace...

638
00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:34.275
This crown... has been in our
family for five generations.

639
00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:35.758
Come on. baby.

640
00:37:38.034 --> 00:37:42.413
And one day. you'll wear it
at the Grand Boule.

641
00:37:42.448 --> 00:37:45.413
Did. did my mommy wear it too?

642
00:37:46.965 --> 00:37:50.482
-Baby. she was supposed to--
-Hey. baby girl! Ah!

643
00:37:54.103 --> 00:37:55.413
-Hey!
-Look at this.

644
00:37:55.517 --> 00:37:56.931
This was mommy's.

645
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.275
Oh. this is pretty.

646
00:37:58.379 --> 00:38:00.655
Did your grandmother
give this to you?

647
00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:04.172
Huh.

648
00:38:04.241 --> 00:38:08.103
Hey. why don't you go upstairs
and get ready for bed

649
00:38:08.172 --> 00:38:11.689
and I'll be up in a minute
to tuck you in?

650
00:38:11.758 --> 00:38:14.137
I just want to talk to your
grandmother for a moment.

651
00:38:14.172 --> 00:38:17.413
-Okay. love you. daddy.
-Love you too. Hey!

652
00:38:17.482 --> 00:38:19.827
-Good night.
-Good night. baby.

653
00:38:29.448 --> 00:38:32.655
You wanna tell me why you were
talking to my daughter

654
00:38:32.724 --> 00:38:34.517
about the Grand Boule?

655
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.551
She needs to know her
family history.

656
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.103
It's tradition. Miles.

657
00:38:39.172 --> 00:38:40.827
Mother. you are unbelievable.
you know that?

658
00:38:40.862 --> 00:38:43.724
-I'm unbelievable?
-Yeah. unbelievable.

659
00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:47.103
Elisha hasn't even been
gone a month.

660
00:38:47.172 --> 00:38:49.655
yet and here you...

661
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.413
You know what. I don't
think we should participate

662
00:38:55.482 --> 00:38:57.103
in the Boule this year.

663
00:38:58.965 --> 00:39:01.172
Miles...

664
00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:03.275
Honey. I know you're grieving.

665
00:39:03.344 --> 00:39:05.068
Yes.

666
00:39:05.137 --> 00:39:08.000
We're all are. love.

667
00:39:08.068 --> 00:39:11.551
But the Grand Boule
was started by our ancestors

668
00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:13.758
who purchased their freedom

669
00:39:13.827 --> 00:39:16.413
and built the
bourbon distillery.

670
00:39:16.517 --> 00:39:19.379
-The Harrington brand.
-Yeah.

671
00:39:19.413 --> 00:39:22.172
That started
our family's fortune.

672
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:25.965
That in which
will always be honored...

673
00:39:26.034 --> 00:39:27.482
by our family.

674
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:29.068
Yeah. the Harrington brand

675
00:39:29.172 --> 00:39:31.482
you know. I heard this story
a thousand times. Mother.

676
00:39:31.551 --> 00:39:33.000
And I understand it. okay?

677
00:39:33.068 --> 00:39:35.206
But Elisha. she meant...

678
00:39:36.827 --> 00:39:39.379
You know what... I can't do this
with you right now.

679
00:39:39.413 --> 00:39:41.448
-Miles...
-This is...

680
00:39:42.827 --> 00:39:47.241
Yes. Chief Lewellyn. what is it?

681
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.206
Sorry to call
so late. Mrs. Harrington.

682
00:39:49.275 --> 00:39:51.758
but I'd thought you'd want to
hear the news right away.

683
00:39:51.862 --> 00:39:55.517
Yes. yes. please.
Go. go right ahead. Chief.

684
00:39:55.586 --> 00:39:58.379
We found the driver
of the car that killed Elisha.

685
00:39:58.482 --> 00:40:00.206
Thank you. God.

686
00:40:05.896 --> 00:40:07.896
Our officers pursued the suspect
and had him trapped.

687
00:40:07.965 --> 00:40:09.413
Once he saw there was no way out

688
00:40:09.517 --> 00:40:11.517
he drove his truck
into the river.

689
00:40:11.586 --> 00:40:14.068
Ernie Reynolds is the prime
suspect in the fatal hit-and-run

690
00:40:14.137 --> 00:40:15.551
of Elisha Harrington.

691
00:40:15.586 --> 00:40:17.655
We're confident that
once our forensics team

692
00:40:17.724 --> 00:40:19.896
gets a hold of his truck.
we will find evidence

693
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.379
that'll match the crime scene.

694
00:40:21.448 --> 00:40:22.724
Thank you.

695
00:40:30.137 --> 00:40:31.724
-Chief...
-Uh-huh?

696
00:40:35.137 --> 00:40:39.241
Uh. are you sure
that this is the driver

697
00:40:39.344 --> 00:40:41.172
that killed Elisha Harrington?

698
00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:44.758
Ernie Reynolds had more DUIs
than the law allows.

699
00:40:44.827 --> 00:40:47.310
Once our officers tried
to pull him over. he took off.

700
00:40:47.379 --> 00:40:49.896
-Cigar?
-Uh. no. thank you.

701
00:40:49.965 --> 00:40:52.689
Only guilty people
run from cops.

702
00:40:52.724 --> 00:40:55.137
Hm. That's right. they do.

703
00:40:59.068 --> 00:41:02.689
-It's a good day.
-Yes. it is.

704
00:41:15.413 --> 00:41:16.827
-Hey.
-Hey.

705
00:41:16.896 --> 00:41:19.793
Are you by any chance
watching the news?

706
00:41:19.896 --> 00:41:21.310
Yep.

707
00:41:21.413 --> 00:41:22.586
Hm-hm. so it's done.

708
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.241
I call bullshit.

709
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.206
Someone's trying to cover up the
fact that Elisha was murdered.

710
00:41:28.275 --> 00:41:29.448
Exactly.

711
00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:39.137
Thank you.

712
00:41:39.206 --> 00:41:43.448
Cheers to that massage and
facial. That was everything.

713
00:41:43.482 --> 00:41:45.413
Uh. cheers to the birthday girl.

714
00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:50.310
One time for the birthday B.
two times for the birthday B.

715
00:41:50.413 --> 00:41:54.448
This was just the birthday
present I needed. thank you.

716
00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:56.482
I'm just so glad you enjoyed it.

717
00:41:56.586 --> 00:41:57.931
It's the least I can do
since you agreed

718
00:41:57.965 --> 00:41:59.965
to make my Grand Boule gown.

719
00:42:00.068 --> 00:42:02.000
It's what Elisha
would have wanted.

720
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.034
I'm just thankful
that they finally

721
00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:06.482
found the guy that killed her.

722
00:42:06.551 --> 00:42:08.517
Do you really think
they found the right guy?

723
00:42:08.586 --> 00:42:10.689
Why? Don't you?

724
00:42:13.379 --> 00:42:16.000
I just can't stop thinking
about Elisha's last voicemail.

725
00:42:17.689 --> 00:42:19.793
I just wonder what she wanted.

726
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.241
Where's Sully?

727
00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:05.655
Oh. God!

728
00:43:10.689 --> 00:43:13.655
-Hey. girl.
-Hey. girl.

729
00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.344
Yo. what's going on over there?

730
00:43:15.413 --> 00:43:17.758
Uh!

731
00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:19.896
I caught myself trying to cook.

732
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:21.448
And who thought that was
a good idea?

733
00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:23.379
Ha. ha! Very funny.

734
00:43:23.448 --> 00:43:25.103
Marcus is on his way over here.
so I thought

735
00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:27.413
I'd at least attempt dinner.

736
00:43:27.448 --> 00:43:29.793
Hm! What's he coming over for?

737
00:43:29.896 --> 00:43:32.172
You're not still thinking
about Ernie Reynolds.

738
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:35.034
Ooh! Are you stealing
Simone's man?

739
00:43:35.103 --> 00:43:38.862
Ugh. girl! Ain't nobody trying
to resuscitate a relationship.

740
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:41.275
I'm the one who broke up
with Marcus. remember?

741
00:43:41.344 --> 00:43:44.206
Girl. there was no lingering
feelings since I moved to DC

742
00:43:44.275 --> 00:43:45.965
for my dream job.

743
00:43:46.068 --> 00:43:48.241
Look. I just don't want you
to get hurt again. okay?

744
00:43:48.275 --> 00:43:50.586
Oh. girl. he's here I gotta go.

745
00:43:50.689 --> 00:43:52.344
-Come in.
-Bye.

746
00:43:56.586 --> 00:43:58.241
Oh!

747
00:44:00.482 --> 00:44:02.000
Wow!

748
00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:05.827
Something burning?

749
00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:09.068
Nothing by my pride.

750
00:44:09.137 --> 00:44:10.827
Now don't tell me
Miss Jordan Touissant

751
00:44:10.931 --> 00:44:14.000
tried to go ahead and cook.

752
00:44:14.103 --> 00:44:15.965
-"Chef Boyar-Don't?"
-Uh-huh.

753
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.655
-Hm-huh.
-Yeah.

754
00:44:17.724 --> 00:44:19.517
Well...

755
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.000
Look at you. making detective.

756
00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:26.517
-It's big.
-It is.

757
00:44:26.586 --> 00:44:29.655
I know. thank you. thank you.
thank you.

758
00:44:29.689 --> 00:44:33.172
Speaking of. um... Detective...

759
00:44:33.206 --> 00:44:36.862
Can you help me detect why a man
police say ran off a bridge

760
00:44:36.965 --> 00:44:41.448
to escape arrest.
didn't die from drowning?

761
00:44:41.517 --> 00:44:44.965
So. you read Ernie Reynold's
autopsy report?

762
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.827
Hm-hm. when I stopped by
to see Sully

763
00:44:47.896 --> 00:44:49.862
there was a Dr. Zhang there.

764
00:44:49.965 --> 00:44:52.241
Apparently. she's from
the Baton Rouge office

765
00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.000
and she was stepping in
to do double duty

766
00:44:55.103 --> 00:44:58.344
because Sully was
on an "extended vacation"

767
00:44:58.413 --> 00:45:01.137
with no return date.

768
00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:02.310
So?

769
00:45:03.551 --> 00:45:05.482
How did you get the report?

770
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:06.896
-Hm!
-Hm!

771
00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:08.689
-Right.
-Hm-hm.

772
00:45:08.724 --> 00:45:11.379
I maybe told her that...

773
00:45:11.413 --> 00:45:14.034
I sometimes help Sully
out with cases

774
00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:18.413
and I just asked her
for Ernie Reynold's autopsy.

775
00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:21.379
And she seemed so overwhelmed
between two offices

776
00:45:21.448 --> 00:45:22.965
that. um. yeah.

777
00:45:23.034 --> 00:45:25.517
She was almost happy
to give it to me.

778
00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:28.344
Gave it to someone that she
thought was there to help.

779
00:45:28.413 --> 00:45:30.724
Tell me why do you think
Ernie Reynolds was dead

780
00:45:30.758 --> 00:45:33.034
before his truck
went into the water.

781
00:45:33.068 --> 00:45:35.517
Well. as you can see here...

782
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:37.034
Hm-hm.

783
00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:38.310
There was no water in his lungs.

784
00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:39.758
Hm.

785
00:45:39.862 --> 00:45:44.862
That means he was dead before
his body ever hit the water.

786
00:45:44.896 --> 00:45:47.241
Hm-hm.

787
00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:50.034
Now. get this.

788
00:45:50.068 --> 00:45:51.413
This is very interesting.
'cause I did

789
00:45:51.517 --> 00:45:54.206
a little bit
more digging myself.

790
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:56.206
The Harrington bourbon
company...

791
00:45:56.241 --> 00:45:58.689
It's been on the rocks
for past few years.

792
00:45:58.724 --> 00:46:00.689
No pun intended.

793
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:05.448
But they've been laying off
a hell of a lot of workers.

794
00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:07.310
-Really?
-Hm-hm.

795
00:46:07.379 --> 00:46:09.586
They don't seem like
they're hurting.

796
00:46:09.655 --> 00:46:12.172
And they just opened
a restaurant last year.

797
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:18.379
But if what you're
saying is true. then...

798
00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:22.275
where's the money coming
from for this

799
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.448
youth center that
Elisha wanted to open?

800
00:46:25.931 --> 00:46:27.448
There you go.

801
00:46:47.379 --> 00:46:48.862
Whatchu want?

802
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.275
I'm sorry to bother you. ma'am.

803
00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.931
My name is Dr. Jordan Touissant.

804
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.034
I wanted to talk to you about
your husband. Ernie Reynolds.

805
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.620
Police done fixed
their story on my Ernie.

806
00:47:00.689 --> 00:47:03.034
Well. that's why I'm here.

807
00:47:03.137 --> 00:47:06.344
I don't believe the story
from the police.

808
00:47:06.379 --> 00:47:09.379
Look. I just wanna know what
really happened to my friend.

809
00:47:09.448 --> 00:47:12.000
-Elisha Harrington.
-Whatchu wanna know?

810
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.344
I can't be seen talking
to nobody 'bout this stuff.

811
00:47:17.724 --> 00:47:20.103
Is somebody threatening you.
Mrs. Reynolds?

812
00:47:20.172 --> 00:47:22.000
Because if they are.
I can get help.

813
00:47:22.034 --> 00:47:24.827
-The police...
-The police?

814
00:47:24.862 --> 00:47:26.517
Don't bring that people
round here.

815
00:47:26.586 --> 00:47:28.517
Mrs. Reynolds. listen...

816
00:47:28.551 --> 00:47:32.000
anything you say to me will
not get back to the police.

817
00:47:33.689 --> 00:47:35.172
You have my word.

818
00:47:37.862 --> 00:47:41.344
My Ernest quit drinking
six months ago.

819
00:47:41.379 --> 00:47:45.172
The pastor at the church was
helping him out real good.

820
00:47:45.206 --> 00:47:48.344
He hadn't touch
that stuff in months.

821
00:47:48.379 --> 00:47:50.379
Ain't no way he hit nobody.

822
00:47:50.482 --> 00:47:53.482
Did the police know
that he stopped drinking?

823
00:47:53.551 --> 00:47:58.344
I told them soon as they
dragged me down to ID his body.

824
00:47:58.379 --> 00:48:01.793
Ain't listen to nothin' I said.

825
00:48:01.862 --> 00:48:04.551
And when they dragged his car
out of the river...

826
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.896
he wasn't able
to refute their story.

827
00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:08.620
And that's when
the other man came by

828
00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:10.344
to make sure
I ain't say nothing.

829
00:48:10.413 --> 00:48:11.931
Wait. what other man?

830
00:48:12.034 --> 00:48:14.896
Ernest got laid off
after twenty years

831
00:48:14.931 --> 00:48:17.413
from the Harrington Distillery.

832
00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:22.068
A man came by and said they'd
freeze his pension if I talked.

833
00:48:22.137 --> 00:48:25.275
Most of the time. nobody cared
what happened in the Ninth Ward

834
00:48:25.344 --> 00:48:27.275
as long as
we was just killing ourselves.

835
00:48:27.379 --> 00:48:29.000
We know that's changed now?

836
00:48:29.068 --> 00:48:30.482
Changed?

837
00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:31.931
Baby. this been

838
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:34.551
Three Crowns gang
territory forever.

839
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.793
Now every blocks being
overrun by redevelopment.

840
00:48:37.896 --> 00:48:42.103
I need that pension money
to hold on to this house.

841
00:48:42.206 --> 00:48:44.758
This is the only thing
I got left from my Ernest.

842
00:48:44.862 --> 00:48:46.482
Wait. Mrs. Reynolds. wait.

843
00:48:48.172 --> 00:48:50.586
Who's behind
the redevelopment?

844
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.172
You said you Elisha Harrington's
friend. right?

845
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:56.241
Then you should already know
the answer.

846
00:48:56.275 --> 00:48:58.931
Look. baby. don't
come 'round here no more.

847
00:48:59.034 --> 00:49:00.724
I don't need no more trouble.

848
00:49:34.103 --> 00:49:35.482
Marcus!

849
00:49:49.689 --> 00:49:51.793
Oh. shit. Jordan!
Jordan! Jordan!

850
00:49:51.827 --> 00:49:54.068
Hey. Jordan.

851
00:49:57.241 --> 00:49:58.758
Jordan.

852
00:50:01.413 --> 00:50:02.827
It's going to be okay.

853
00:50:08.724 --> 00:50:10.620
Easy. easy.

854
00:50:10.689 --> 00:50:12.517
Oh. good. You're awake.
Do you mind?

855
00:50:12.586 --> 00:50:14.482
-No. go ahead.
-Thank you.

856
00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:18.068
-Open those eyes for me.
-Hmm-hmm!

857
00:50:18.137 --> 00:50:19.413
Eyes open.

858
00:50:20.793 --> 00:50:22.310
-Ah!
-Yeah!

859
00:50:22.344 --> 00:50:24.068
Yeah. you've got
quite a concussion.

860
00:50:24.137 --> 00:50:25.827
Which you're fortunate because

861
00:50:25.862 --> 00:50:28.206
you know. head injuries
can be real serious.

862
00:50:31.586 --> 00:50:33.620
When can she go home.
Harrington?

863
00:50:33.689 --> 00:50:35.241
I'll write a prescription
for the headache

864
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.482
you're definitely
going to have.

865
00:50:38.517 --> 00:50:40.896
But she shouldn't
be alone for a while.

866
00:50:40.965 --> 00:50:44.413
-I'm gonna be fine.
-Hey. hey.

867
00:50:44.482 --> 00:50:47.172
Okay. hey. easy.
take it easy. okay?

868
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:49.827
Yeah. yeah. excuse me.
Uh. look...

869
00:50:49.931 --> 00:50:51.413
Hey...

870
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:55.793
Don't worry. I got you.

871
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.586
Yes?

872
00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:03.758
You got it?

873
00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:05.620
Yeah. yeah. thank you.
Harrington.

874
00:51:08.724 --> 00:51:11.068
Jordan. are you sure
you don't want to just rest?

875
00:51:11.137 --> 00:51:13.482
Miles said take it easy.

876
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:14.551
I'm fine.

877
00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:18.896
All right.

878
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.793
Besides... I have a surprise.

879
00:51:23.862 --> 00:51:25.206
And what is this?

880
00:51:25.241 --> 00:51:26.896
Elisha's laptop.

881
00:51:29.241 --> 00:51:31.482
How did do you get
Elisha's laptop?

882
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:34.689
Well. after I spoke
to Ernie Reynold's wife.

883
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.310
I went by Elisha's office
at the foundation.

884
00:51:37.379 --> 00:51:39.896
I told her assistant
that I needed to

885
00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:43.827
gather some information
for the Boule announcement.

886
00:51:43.896 --> 00:51:47.551
And her laptop
was just on her desk.

887
00:51:49.862 --> 00:51:51.206
Okay.

888
00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.793
Okay. let's see.

889
00:51:55.413 --> 00:51:57.551
No. it's not her birthday.

890
00:51:59.586 --> 00:52:02.551
Hmm. Well. maybe it's something
to do with her daughter.

891
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.965
Maybe. uh. songs or lyric...

892
00:52:06.068 --> 00:52:07.724
You know what?

893
00:52:07.793 --> 00:52:10.103
Her daughter was named after a
character in her favorite book.

894
00:52:10.172 --> 00:52:13.034
She must have read it like
a hundred times in college.

895
00:52:18.896 --> 00:52:20.793
-There we go!
-We're in.

896
00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:22.275
Here we go.

897
00:52:24.758 --> 00:52:26.310
Hmm...

898
00:52:26.379 --> 00:52:28.275
My affair
with your husband...

899
00:52:29.793 --> 00:52:31.275
What is this?

900
00:52:34.103 --> 00:52:35.965
Oh. my God!

901
00:52:36.034 --> 00:52:38.793
It looks like someone
was sending Elisha

902
00:52:38.862 --> 00:52:41.689
emails for over a year.
taunting her.

903
00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:43.275
Hmm. let me see.

904
00:52:45.103 --> 00:52:48.482
And really explicit details...

905
00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:51.862
of all their sexual
rendezvous around town.

906
00:52:51.931 --> 00:52:53.620
Hmm!

907
00:52:53.689 --> 00:52:54.965
Wait. hold on!

908
00:52:57.379 --> 00:52:59.965
Your husband doesn't
want you anymore.

909
00:53:00.034 --> 00:53:02.965
He's laying in my bed
night after night...

910
00:53:03.034 --> 00:53:05.000
when you think
he's at the hospital.

911
00:53:06.344 --> 00:53:08.379
This is crazy.

912
00:53:08.482 --> 00:53:10.517
And the email is untraceable.

913
00:53:12.206 --> 00:53:15.379
And of course I can't ask the
department's tech to look up

914
00:53:15.448 --> 00:53:17.172
the IP address. 'cause...

915
00:53:17.206 --> 00:53:18.965
Without raising flags
with the chief.

916
00:53:19.034 --> 00:53:22.689
Actually I might know someone
who can help us.

917
00:53:32.172 --> 00:53:33.379
Well. hello.

918
00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:34.517
To what do I owe the pleasure

919
00:53:34.551 --> 00:53:36.034
of this bedtime phone call?

920
00:53:36.103 --> 00:53:39.379
Um. hey. Thomas.
I need a favor.

921
00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.689
Anything for you.

922
00:53:41.724 --> 00:53:45.862
I need to trace an
IP address from an email.

923
00:53:45.896 --> 00:53:47.965
Do you think you could have
someone look at it?

924
00:53:48.034 --> 00:53:49.482
Yeah. No problem.

925
00:53:49.517 --> 00:53:51.517
Send it over.

926
00:53:51.551 --> 00:53:53.931
So I think you got some friends
in mighty high places.

927
00:53:56.034 --> 00:53:57.517
So...

928
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.103
What else do you think that
Miles is been hiding?

929
00:54:02.206 --> 00:54:03.689
I don't know.

930
00:54:05.344 --> 00:54:06.931
But whatever it is. it was...

931
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.068
worth someone tryin'
to kill me over.

932
00:54:09.137 --> 00:54:11.413
All right. listen. I'm leaving
at the end of the week. so...

933
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.482
we need to figure
this out quickly.

934
00:54:16.758 --> 00:54:19.931
Wait. hold on.
What-what is this?

935
00:54:21.344 --> 00:54:26.034
It looks like she...
signed a lease for a townhome.

936
00:54:28.172 --> 00:54:30.758
Do you think she was planning
on leaving Miles?

937
00:54:30.862 --> 00:54:32.758
Well...

938
00:54:32.862 --> 00:54:34.586
there's only one way
to find out.

939
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.827
How do we even get in
to the townhouse?

940
00:54:38.068 --> 00:54:40.000
One second.

941
00:54:41.896 --> 00:54:44.413
It's my turn to call
a little favor from a friend.

942
00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:48.034
Hey!

943
00:54:48.103 --> 00:54:50.172
Yeah. yeah. doing good.

944
00:54:50.241 --> 00:54:52.482
Huh. can you do me
a little favor?

945
00:54:53.448 --> 00:54:55.310
Oh. I'm sorry. one sec.

946
00:55:11.172 --> 00:55:13.000
Well. that was nice of
your girlfriend to call

947
00:55:13.034 --> 00:55:15.482
the security guard to
let us into the development.

948
00:55:18.068 --> 00:55:19.482
Yes. it was.

949
00:55:20.827 --> 00:55:23.931
Simone's sold a couple of
units in the complex. so

950
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.896
it was a pretty
easy call to make.

951
00:55:25.965 --> 00:55:28.655
There's nothing
of Elisha's inside.

952
00:55:32.172 --> 00:55:35.586
So why did she sign
a lease in this neighborhood?

953
00:55:38.103 --> 00:55:42.827
This area was once controlled by
the city's most grimiest gang

954
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:44.172
Triple Crowns.

955
00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:47.655
until a real estate
development company.

956
00:55:47.689 --> 00:55:49.586
by the name of
BlackCourt Holdings.

957
00:55:49.655 --> 00:55:51.724
started buying
everything in sight.

958
00:55:53.586 --> 00:55:56.482
Well. on another note...

959
00:55:59.103 --> 00:56:02.655
I see you wearing
that perfume that I love.

960
00:56:02.724 --> 00:56:04.379
I never stopped wearing it
after you gave it

961
00:56:04.413 --> 00:56:06.034
to me for Valentine's Day.

962
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.551
Why aren't you responding?

963
00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:17.551
I can't stop
thinking about you.

964
00:56:19.896 --> 00:56:23.896
And... can't stop
thinking about us.

965
00:56:25.034 --> 00:56:27.448
I got a little
confession for you.

966
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.172
The night you left New Orleans
after your mother's funeral...

967
00:56:35.724 --> 00:56:38.172
I was coming
over to propose.

968
00:56:38.241 --> 00:56:39.724
What?

969
00:56:44.793 --> 00:56:46.724
I don't know what to say.

970
00:56:49.551 --> 00:56:52.172
You could've said yes.

971
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:54.000
I loved you so much.

972
00:56:55.206 --> 00:56:56.724
But...

973
00:56:59.517 --> 00:57:01.793
But you left me.

974
00:57:01.862 --> 00:57:03.689
You know why I left.

975
00:57:04.793 --> 00:57:06.620
We had been
fighting for weeks.

976
00:57:08.172 --> 00:57:13.482
The stress of taking care
of my mom and juggling work...

977
00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:17.655
it was just too painful to stay
in New Orleans after she died.

978
00:57:17.724 --> 00:57:20.241
So when I got an offer
to go to DC

979
00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.517
and run a lab.
that is what I needed.

980
00:57:28.965 --> 00:57:30.655
Why didn't you come with me?

981
00:57:30.724 --> 00:57:34.137
âª Praying that
I'm strong enough âª

982
00:57:34.206 --> 00:57:38.448
âª You thinking
I'm strong enough oh no âª

983
00:57:42.379 --> 00:57:47.413
âª Leaving you was hard enough
hard enough âª

984
00:57:55.655 --> 00:57:58.965
âª You thinking
I'm strong enough âª

985
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.689
âª I don't know really know
what to do âª

986
00:58:07.724 --> 00:58:09.172
âª I have a million questions

987
00:58:09.206 --> 00:58:11.655
âª I've been all alone
away from you âª

988
00:58:11.724 --> 00:58:14.689
âª Baby I've been stressing
I wish I could say âª

989
00:58:14.793 --> 00:58:17.172
âª You stole my heart... âª

990
00:58:22.689 --> 00:58:26.034
Hello? Earth to Jordan.

991
00:58:26.068 --> 00:58:31.310
I'm sorry. girl.
this dress is everything.

992
00:58:31.379 --> 00:58:32.827
You did the damn thing.

993
00:58:32.862 --> 00:58:36.379
Yes. I did.
But what's going on?

994
00:58:36.448 --> 00:58:38.758
You worried about the house
not selling or something?

995
00:58:40.482 --> 00:58:42.551
No. it's just...

996
00:58:42.655 --> 00:58:44.034
I'm just trying to find
more information

997
00:58:44.068 --> 00:58:46.689
on the suspect that the
police say killed Elisha.

998
00:58:49.655 --> 00:58:51.206
What information?

999
00:58:51.275 --> 00:58:53.344
The cops already said his car
matches the one at the

1000
00:58:53.379 --> 00:58:56.172
scene. and that street cams
caught him in the area.

1001
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.103
But that doesn't explain
why someone came to my house.

1002
00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:05.448
You don't believe this was
a some random break-in?

1003
00:59:05.551 --> 00:59:09.379
Am I surprised that someone
broke into your townhome? No.

1004
00:59:09.448 --> 00:59:13.896
Do I believe that a guy with a
hundred DUIs killed our friend?

1005
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:16.379
Yes. Case closed.

1006
00:59:18.034 --> 00:59:20.586
Personally.
I'm glad his ass is dead.

1007
00:59:34.758 --> 00:59:37.758
Yo. that shit hurt. doc.
Hurry up.

1008
00:59:40.482 --> 00:59:42.758
Easy. Okay.

1009
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.068
You didn't tell me how you got
this knife wound on your arm.

1010
00:59:47.103 --> 00:59:48.793
Not sure you want
to know that.

1011
00:59:48.862 --> 00:59:50.931
Lots going on in these streets.
Ya feel me?

1012
00:59:52.931 --> 00:59:55.379
Do you need any help.
Dr. Harrington?

1013
00:59:55.448 --> 00:59:59.172
No. no. I'm almost done here.
All right. Thank you.

1014
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:01.793
Well. I just thought you'd
want to know the stabbing victim

1015
01:00:01.896 --> 01:00:04.413
you operated on this afternoon
didn't make it.

1016
01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.000
Police are on their way.

1017
01:00:11.517 --> 01:00:14.068
Oh. excuse me. I'm looking
for Dr. Harrington.

1018
01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:17.344
-He's in exam bay number three.
-Thank you.

1019
01:00:20.068 --> 01:00:22.586
I'll be back tomorrow. Doc.

1020
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.551
Make sure you're here.
We good?

1021
01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:27.413
Yeah. Yeah!

1022
01:00:27.448 --> 01:00:29.448
I'll see you tomorrow and
I'll check on those stitches

1023
01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:33.241
and... I'll get that
prescription for you.

1024
01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.689
Hmm-hm!

1025
01:00:37.275 --> 01:00:40.827
Hey. Jordan.
What are you doing here?

1026
01:00:40.896 --> 01:00:42.379
I was just coming by to see

1027
01:00:42.448 --> 01:00:44.172
if you could check up
my head again.

1028
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:47.448
I'm hoping to get rid of this
bandage before the Boule.

1029
01:00:47.517 --> 01:00:50.724
I also was wondering if
I could take you to dinner.

1030
01:00:50.758 --> 01:00:52.689
We haven't really had a chance

1031
01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:54.379
to really spend
any time together.

1032
01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:56.379
Yeah. you know what.
that sounds great.

1033
01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:59.241
Let me just finish
this paperwork here

1034
01:00:59.275 --> 01:01:01.172
and I'll come back and check on
that head. okay?

1035
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.000
-Thank you.
-All right.

1036
01:01:35.172 --> 01:01:38.068
Hey. Thanks again for staying
for the Grand Boule.

1037
01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:40.310
It really means
a lot to mother.

1038
01:01:41.896 --> 01:01:44.758
-And me too.
-Happy to.

1039
01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:46.379
You know. you're lucky
to be alive.

1040
01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:50.068
And you were lucky
to be married to Elisha.

1041
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:55.310
So then. why did you
cheat on her?

1042
01:02:06.068 --> 01:02:08.758
It's not something
that I'm proud of.

1043
01:02:08.862 --> 01:02:11.758
And nothing's happening right
now. I can promise you that.

1044
01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:13.724
Okay? It-it all ended
a year ago.

1045
01:02:13.827 --> 01:02:16.482
-Who was it?
-It was a nurse.

1046
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:18.862
Nurse at the hospital.

1047
01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:20.206
Does she still work there?

1048
01:02:20.241 --> 01:02:22.413
No. She moved to Shreveport.

1049
01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:24.862
We both agreed that
it was for the best.

1050
01:02:24.896 --> 01:02:27.034
How could you do that to Elisha?

1051
01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:29.862
To your daughter?

1052
01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:32.724
What I did was wrong.
I know that.

1053
01:02:32.827 --> 01:02:34.241
Okay?

1054
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:37.413
That affair was the
worst mistake of my life.

1055
01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:39.068
Yeah. when Elisha found
out about it.

1056
01:02:39.137 --> 01:02:43.137
after she found out about it.
she confronted me.

1057
01:02:43.206 --> 01:02:45.241
Look. we went-we went to
counseling for a year

1058
01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:47.551
just to repair this marriage.

1059
01:02:47.586 --> 01:02:49.896
We worked hard. both of us.

1060
01:02:51.482 --> 01:02:56.551
Our marriage. our marriage was
in such a. such a good place.

1061
01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:59.965
We... even made plans of

1062
01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:02.379
finally moving out
of mother's estate.

1063
01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.448
Why? Elisha loved that place.

1064
01:03:10.448 --> 01:03:12.103
Let's just say
it was about time.

1065
01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:16.413
We found this nice. beautiful

1066
01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:18.655
plot of land to
build our dream home on.

1067
01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:21.586
We knew that it will take about
a year for us to build it.

1068
01:03:21.655 --> 01:03:25.310
So. Elisha went out and found a
beautiful townhouse for us

1069
01:03:25.413 --> 01:03:28.758
to stay in just until
it was finished being built.

1070
01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:30.586
Now-now she's gone.

1071
01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.965
Hey. you two.

1072
01:03:32.034 --> 01:03:33.965
I saw you on the window.

1073
01:03:34.034 --> 01:03:35.206
You don't mind if I join.
do you?

1074
01:03:35.275 --> 01:03:37.448
Oh. please. Sit down.

1075
01:03:37.517 --> 01:03:38.793
Right.

1076
01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:40.931
Ashton's at my cousin's tonight.

1077
01:03:40.965 --> 01:03:44.448
so mama is a free woman.

1078
01:03:44.482 --> 01:03:48.103
I... I stopped by the hospital
to take Miles to dinner.

1079
01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:53.862
We really haven't had a chance
to talk since the funeral.

1080
01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:56.275
Yeah. how have you been. Miles?

1081
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.965
I feel like I haven't
talked to you in so long.

1082
01:04:00.068 --> 01:04:02.103
You have been getting
my messages. right?

1083
01:04:03.551 --> 01:04:05.689
I've actually been
staying busy at the hospital

1084
01:04:05.724 --> 01:04:08.517
because whenever I'm home.
all I can do is

1085
01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.344
think about my wife

1086
01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.586
laying on the side of the road.

1087
01:04:12.655 --> 01:04:15.586
scared. cold...

1088
01:04:17.965 --> 01:04:19.448
alone.

1089
01:04:22.103 --> 01:04:26.000
Sorry. must be so hard
on you and Amaya Grace.

1090
01:04:38.034 --> 01:04:39.482
What the hell. Marcus?

1091
01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:41.344
So this why you needed
to get into the townhouse

1092
01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:43.034
so you could screw
your ex-girlfriend!

1093
01:04:43.137 --> 01:04:45.103
On the balcony. really?

1094
01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.344
I can't believe you.

1095
01:04:47.413 --> 01:04:49.000
Don't touch me!

1096
01:04:54.344 --> 01:04:56.931
Well. well.
what do we have here?

1097
01:05:01.413 --> 01:05:04.000
Detective. perhaps
we should talk in my office.

1098
01:05:06.655 --> 01:05:08.068
Detective!

1099
01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:24.413
âª Praying that
I'm strong enough âª

1100
01:05:24.448 --> 01:05:28.758
âª You think
I'm strong enough oh no âª

1101
01:06:54.517 --> 01:06:56.344
Jordan. last night.
you sent me a text

1102
01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.344
saying that we made a mistake.

1103
01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:00.482
And this morning.
it's. "911. get over here."

1104
01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.896
So. please. tell me
which one is it?

1105
01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.689
What took you so long?
I texted you over an hour ago.

1106
01:07:05.758 --> 01:07:08.241
I'm sorry. I was meeting
with my union rep

1107
01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.310
about my newly
instated suspension.

1108
01:07:12.413 --> 01:07:14.551
-Suspension? For what?
-Yes.

1109
01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.482
Suspension...

1110
01:07:16.551 --> 01:07:19.724
For behavior unbecoming of a
police officer while on duty.

1111
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.896
Someone sent pictures of us

1112
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.241
on that balcony last night

1113
01:07:26.344 --> 01:07:29.103
to Simone and the
entire department.

1114
01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.724
-Are you serious?
-Yes. I am.

1115
01:07:33.793 --> 01:07:35.413
Serious.

1116
01:07:35.517 --> 01:07:39.241
Maybe that's the person who
broke into my house last night.

1117
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.862
Elisha's laptop is missing.

1118
01:07:47.482 --> 01:07:48.896
Well...

1119
01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:51.413
Okay. well. hey...

1120
01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:53.655
Are you sure you just didn't
forget where you put it?

1121
01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:56.413
When I went to sleep last night

1122
01:07:56.517 --> 01:07:58.000
the laptop was
on the nightstand.

1123
01:07:58.068 --> 01:08:00.793
I know that because my phone
was on top of it.

1124
01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:02.448
Your phone...

1125
01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:04.793
Was that before or after
you sent this?

1126
01:08:04.862 --> 01:08:05.965
"We made a mistake."

1127
01:08:09.482 --> 01:08:12.103
We did make a mistake.

1128
01:08:12.137 --> 01:08:13.793
Can we please just focus
on the fact that

1129
01:08:13.896 --> 01:08:16.827
someone came into my
house last night?

1130
01:08:16.896 --> 01:08:20.862
When I woke up. my phone was
there but the laptop was gone.

1131
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:22.275
Well...

1132
01:08:24.137 --> 01:08:26.310
Yeah. someone must now know

1133
01:08:26.413 --> 01:08:28.137
that we're looking
into Elisha's death.

1134
01:08:28.241 --> 01:08:30.103
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1135
01:08:30.137 --> 01:08:31.448
But who?

1136
01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:40.034
Why don't you... call him
and ask him?

1137
01:08:40.103 --> 01:08:41.448
Beautiful.

1138
01:08:43.965 --> 01:08:45.620
I can call Thomas later.

1139
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.793
You know. when I was
at the hospital...

1140
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:54.793
Miles was stitching up
a patient.

1141
01:08:54.862 --> 01:08:57.137
This guy with that...

1142
01:08:57.206 --> 01:08:58.689
Three Crowns tattoo.

1143
01:09:00.862 --> 01:09:02.551
I could've sworn
it was the same guy

1144
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.344
I saw at Tamera's boutique.

1145
01:09:10.275 --> 01:09:11.758
Wow.

1146
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.206
Interesting part is...

1147
01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:20.379
usually them gangsters don't
even seek hospital... treatment

1148
01:09:20.482 --> 01:09:21.862
'cause they're scared they gonna
attract attention

1149
01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:23.517
from most cops.

1150
01:09:23.551 --> 01:09:25.172
So the real question is

1151
01:09:25.206 --> 01:09:27.241
what could he possibly
want with Miles?

1152
01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:32.000
From what I overheard.

1153
01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:34.344
it sounded like they
had unfinished business.

1154
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Ah!

1155
01:09:45.034 --> 01:09:49.206
Look at this beautiful boy.

1156
01:09:49.275 --> 01:09:51.206
Tamera. he looks
just like you.

1157
01:09:51.275 --> 01:09:52.965
That's mama's little man.

1158
01:09:53.034 --> 01:09:54.793
Aww!

1159
01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:56.034
So sweet.

1160
01:09:56.137 --> 01:09:58.689
Oh. thanks for stopping by
to pick up the dress.

1161
01:09:58.724 --> 01:10:01.689
I just finished the
alterations last night.

1162
01:10:03.448 --> 01:10:05.206
For you. my dear.

1163
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:07.862
The Belle of the Boule.

1164
01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:11.344
Thank you.

1165
01:10:11.413 --> 01:10:12.862
I appreciate it.

1166
01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:17.586
Girl. what's wrong?
You look stressed.

1167
01:10:20.206 --> 01:10:21.517
Did you know that
Miles and Elisha

1168
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.448
were having marital problems?

1169
01:10:23.517 --> 01:10:25.689
Problems? What do you mean?

1170
01:10:25.724 --> 01:10:31.172
Last year. Elisha found out
that Miles was having an affair.

1171
01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:32.965
Miles?

1172
01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:34.655
No!

1173
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.551
He would never cheat on Elisha.

1174
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.344
No. I found the emails that
Elisha sent to the other woman.

1175
01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:42.689
What?

1176
01:10:42.793 --> 01:10:45.517
So you know who this woman is?

1177
01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:48.758
He claims it's one of the
nurses at the hospital.

1178
01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.551
I have somebody
looking into it.

1179
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.103
Why would he lie about cheating
on Elisha with a nurse?

1180
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:56.862
I don't know.

1181
01:10:57.965 --> 01:10:59.862
Have you ever heard of...

1182
01:11:01.275 --> 01:11:03.724
Mayfair Springs
Luxury Townhomes

1183
01:11:03.758 --> 01:11:06.482
owned by BlackCourt Holdings?

1184
01:11:07.758 --> 01:11:10.034
No. why?

1185
01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:13.793
She had a lease agreement
for a townhome there.

1186
01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:18.034
I'm wondering if she was
thinking about leaving Miles.

1187
01:11:18.103 --> 01:11:20.448
And. I mean. what if
he found out and...

1188
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.965
And what. girl?
He killed her?

1189
01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:25.758
I mean. even if Miles was having
an affair with someone

1190
01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:27.655
he doesn't want you
to know about.

1191
01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:29.827
doesn't mean he killed her.

1192
01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:31.931
Girl. I really do think
that concussion

1193
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.344
messed with your head.

1194
01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:43.482
I'm telling you.

1195
01:11:43.551 --> 01:11:45.448
Something is not right.

1196
01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.068
Girl. will you please stop
running around

1197
01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.758
playing CSI New Orleans?

1198
01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.103
Sorry.

1199
01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:55.758
Please just try on the dress.

1200
01:11:55.793 --> 01:11:57.827
I'm gonna go check
on Miles's baby sister.

1201
01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:59.068
While you do that.

1202
01:12:00.551 --> 01:12:02.068
You're right.

1203
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.482
Jordan?

1204
01:12:16.517 --> 01:12:18.482
-Jordan?
-I'm in here.

1205
01:12:26.758 --> 01:12:28.000
Wow!

1206
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.482
My God!

1207
01:12:32.517 --> 01:12:34.482
You look absolutely beautiful.

1208
01:12:37.965 --> 01:12:39.413
Um...

1209
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.655
Do you mind helping me
with my zipper?

1210
01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:46.482
Sure.

1211
01:12:55.965 --> 01:12:57.379
Marcus. we can't.

1212
01:12:57.448 --> 01:12:59.000
Why?

1213
01:12:59.103 --> 01:13:01.724
Is it because
you're with Thomas?

1214
01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.034
Aren't you with Simone?

1215
01:13:06.034 --> 01:13:07.551
Simone isn't you.

1216
01:13:12.413 --> 01:13:15.862
âª Sometimes bad girls

1217
01:13:15.896 --> 01:13:18.379
âª Gotta take...

1218
01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:31.344
âª Come on come on come on

1219
01:13:38.758 --> 01:13:41.000
Jordan. come on out here
so I can see

1220
01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:44.068
if there's anything else
I need to do to the dress.

1221
01:13:44.137 --> 01:13:45.724
Okay.

1222
01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.896
Girl. this red
is popping on you.

1223
01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.551
Whoo!

1224
01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:01.793
Oh!

1225
01:14:03.034 --> 01:14:06.413
Well. hey. Marcus.
What are you doing here?

1226
01:14:06.448 --> 01:14:07.827
Uh. hey. Tamera.

1227
01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:10.034
I just came by to give Jordan
a little update.

1228
01:14:10.103 --> 01:14:11.413
Hmm. An update?

1229
01:14:11.482 --> 01:14:13.620
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

1230
01:14:13.689 --> 01:14:16.689
Stop. Marcus. you should go.

1231
01:14:16.758 --> 01:14:18.275
We need to finish this dress.

1232
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:19.793
The Boule is this weekend.

1233
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.448
Have a good day. lady.

1234
01:14:25.551 --> 01:14:26.965
Bye. Marcus.

1235
01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:29.793
Tamera...

1236
01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:33.620
Girl. you got a little
sneaky link going on in here.

1237
01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:35.206
You know. like that.

1238
01:14:35.275 --> 01:14:36.758
It's-it's nothing.

1239
01:14:36.793 --> 01:14:38.275
Girl. who're you fooling?

1240
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.034
It is clear by the look
on both of your faces

1241
01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:43.620
that you both still
have feelings

1242
01:14:43.724 --> 01:14:45.827
Look...

1243
01:14:45.896 --> 01:14:48.793
I just need to find out what
really happened to Elisha

1244
01:14:48.862 --> 01:14:51.068
and then I can
get back to DC.

1245
01:14:51.137 --> 01:14:52.758
Back to my life.

1246
01:14:52.793 --> 01:14:54.827
There's no Marcus.

1247
01:14:54.896 --> 01:14:58.068
I don't know why you insist
on lying to yourself.

1248
01:14:58.137 --> 01:15:01.655
but what I do know is that
this dress is perfection.

1249
01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:03.965
-Hmm!
-Hmm-hm.

1250
01:15:04.034 --> 01:15:05.655
It is!

1251
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:07.413
And with two days to spare.

1252
01:15:07.482 --> 01:15:09.000
Yes. ma'am.

1253
01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.620
Thank you.

1254
01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:16.068
All right.
I'm gonna take it off.

1255
01:15:21.103 --> 01:15:24.931
Look. wait...
No. we need to meet.

1256
01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:28.000
I don't care what you think.

1257
01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:34.103
Jordan's been asking
too many questions.

1258
01:15:38.275 --> 01:15:41.827
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

1259
01:15:41.862 --> 01:15:43.517
You need to keep
your mouth shut.

1260
01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:46.034
I heard you've been talking to
the wrong people.

1261
01:15:46.137 --> 01:15:47.896
And if you want to
keep the pension

1262
01:15:47.965 --> 01:15:50.551
and the rest of the money.
you'll shut the hell up.

1263
01:15:50.655 --> 01:15:54.034
Well. look who's
giving orders now.

1264
01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:56.896
What you think.
you big shit?

1265
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.931
You think them people
up there gonna ever see

1266
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.275
you for more than you are?

1267
01:16:01.344 --> 01:16:05.379
Girl. you ain't nothing. but
trash from the Ninth Ward?

1268
01:16:05.448 --> 01:16:08.206
You always thought you was
better than somebody ever since

1269
01:16:08.275 --> 01:16:11.206
you started hanging out
with that Harrington girl.

1270
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.896
You turned your back
on your own blood.

1271
01:16:14.931 --> 01:16:17.241
After me and Ernie
raised your ass.

1272
01:16:18.758 --> 01:16:20.482
Anyway...

1273
01:16:20.551 --> 01:16:22.275
Ernie is dead now.

1274
01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:25.068
So if you want me
to stop talking.

1275
01:16:25.103 --> 01:16:27.448
I'm going to need
some more money.

1276
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:29.379
'Cause that pension alone
ain't going to keep me

1277
01:16:29.448 --> 01:16:31.758
in the style of livin'
I become accustom to.

1278
01:16:32.862 --> 01:16:35.586
So you better get me
some more money.

1279
01:16:35.655 --> 01:16:37.758
You'll get your money.

1280
01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.551
I know that's all you
ever cared about.

1281
01:16:47.862 --> 01:16:49.965
I'm gonna leave you.

1282
01:16:50.034 --> 01:16:53.586
I want you to lock that door and
make sure nobody comes in. okay?

1283
01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.241
-Yes. sir.
-Okay.

1284
01:16:57.344 --> 01:16:59.931
I'mma go home
and I'm gonna get some clothes

1285
01:16:59.965 --> 01:17:02.172
and I'm gonna come here and
stay with you for tonight.

1286
01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:04.275
But first. I'm gonna stop by
the station to see

1287
01:17:04.344 --> 01:17:06.827
if there's any word
on your break-in.

1288
01:17:06.896 --> 01:17:08.482
-Marcus.
-Yes?

1289
01:17:08.517 --> 01:17:11.448
You don't have to babysit me.
He's not gonna to come back.

1290
01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.034
I want to be here to make sure.

1291
01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:17.000
All right.

1292
01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:19.827
-Okay.
-Goodnight.

1293
01:17:21.517 --> 01:17:24.827
I will not... lose you again.

1294
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.241
Now... I know you probably
have not been shooting...

1295
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:33.344
Hmm-hmm. no.

1296
01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:35.482
Touissant. you look
at me and listen.

1297
01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:41.310
This is a loaded weapon.

1298
01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:44.827
And what I need you to do...

1299
01:17:45.758 --> 01:17:48.896
You unload this entire magazine

1300
01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.827
if anybody but me
comes through that door.

1301
01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:55.689
Okay?

1302
01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:58.448
-Let me hear you say it. Okay?
-Okay.

1303
01:17:58.482 --> 01:18:00.379
Okay.

1304
01:18:00.448 --> 01:18:01.517
Okay.

1305
01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:05.827
I will see you soon.

1306
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:22.034
You know...

1307
01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:28.517
I told Elisha to watch out
for the likes of you.

1308
01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:31.379
You're not just one
of our kind of people.

1309
01:18:32.724 --> 01:18:37.206
Trash will always be trash.

1310
01:18:38.827 --> 01:18:41.862
You were a
conniving manipulator

1311
01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:45.379
riding on Elisha's
pedigree coattails.

1312
01:18:45.413 --> 01:18:49.689
Always begging to borrow money
for your little boutique.

1313
01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.517
-That was an investment.
-Oh!

1314
01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:53.206
Elisha believed in me.

1315
01:18:53.275 --> 01:18:54.724
Okay!

1316
01:18:54.827 --> 01:18:57.896
So what did you do
to repay her?

1317
01:18:57.965 --> 01:19:00.896
Sleep with her husband.

1318
01:19:00.931 --> 01:19:05.448
But I guess if your
mother's a whore...

1319
01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:08.931
why would you grow up
to be any different?

1320
01:19:08.965 --> 01:19:11.931
Little girl. don't you dare.

1321
01:19:11.965 --> 01:19:14.793
I wasn't surprised
when my son was seduced

1322
01:19:14.862 --> 01:19:17.586
by his wife's best friend.

1323
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.448
I was just disappointed...

1324
01:19:20.482 --> 01:19:24.758
that he had to knock your
raggedy ass up.

1325
01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.655
And I had to clean up his mess.

1326
01:19:27.758 --> 01:19:30.275
I need money if you want
this plan to continue.

1327
01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:34.586
Jordan's been sniffing around
and...

1328
01:19:34.655 --> 01:19:36.586
she's starting to
put the pieces together.

1329
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.034
Hmm.

1330
01:19:41.103 --> 01:19:43.172
I don't have enough money
in the house.

1331
01:19:46.034 --> 01:19:48.034
But you can make this work.

1332
01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:53.689
Oh. and take your
little bastard with you.

1333
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.275
Yes. she's becoming a problem.

1334
01:20:16.413 --> 01:20:18.034
Fix it.

1335
01:20:18.103 --> 01:20:20.310
The Grand Boule is this weekend.

1336
01:20:20.413 --> 01:20:23.586
And that bitch can't ruin
my announcement.

1337
01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.482
-Hey. girl!
-Hey. Tam.

1338
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.275
I was just calling
to let you know that

1339
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:44.793
I'm not going to make it
dinner tonight.

1340
01:20:44.896 --> 01:20:47.275
Marcus is gonna stop by later.

1341
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.137
Oh. we should actually find out

1342
01:20:49.206 --> 01:20:51.275
who Miles was having
an affair with tonight.

1343
01:20:54.206 --> 01:20:56.275
Look. girl. all I care
about is you. Okay?

1344
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.758
Um... I need to run
a few errands.

1345
01:20:58.827 --> 01:21:00.827
I'm gonna drop Ashton off
at the babysitters.

1346
01:21:00.862 --> 01:21:03.482
But I'll be right over. okay?

1347
01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:06.379
But. girl. you do not have
to come over here.

1348
01:21:06.448 --> 01:21:08.344
I told you. Marcus is coming.
I'll be fine.

1349
01:21:08.379 --> 01:21:11.862
No. you shouldn't be alone.
Okay?

1350
01:21:11.965 --> 01:21:14.517
I'll be right over.
I love you.

1351
01:21:14.586 --> 01:21:16.172
I love you too. Okay.

1352
01:21:53.379 --> 01:21:55.379
What are you doing back in my
station when you're suspended?

1353
01:21:55.448 --> 01:21:58.000
I heard over the radio that
Dayveon Simms was brought in

1354
01:21:58.034 --> 01:22:01.241
for suspected break-in
at my friend's house.

1355
01:22:01.275 --> 01:22:03.448
And I want to see
what he had to say.

1356
01:22:03.517 --> 01:22:05.517
This city has over
a 100 murders a year.

1357
01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:08.068
We don't have the time or
manpower to waste precious

1358
01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:09.931
resources on a break-in
where no one was

1359
01:22:10.034 --> 01:22:11.827
seriously hurt and
nothing of value taken.

1360
01:22:11.896 --> 01:22:13.103
She was assaulted.

1361
01:22:13.206 --> 01:22:14.724
Let me shoot straight so even

1362
01:22:14.758 --> 01:22:17.241
you can understand. detective.

1363
01:22:17.275 --> 01:22:18.620
You've been looking
into some things

1364
01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.758
that don't really require
your attention.

1365
01:22:20.862 --> 01:22:22.586
Take this suspension seriously

1366
01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.655
before I throw you
off the force permanently.

1367
01:22:25.724 --> 01:22:27.241
Do I make myself clear?

1368
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.517
Hmm.

1369
01:22:34.931 --> 01:22:36.103
Yes. sir.

1370
01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.172
-Knock-knock.
-Oh. my God! Girl!

1371
01:22:52.241 --> 01:22:56.103
Tamera. you do not have
to wait on me.

1372
01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:59.103
Really. I told you. I'm fine.

1373
01:22:59.206 --> 01:23:00.758
Babe. it's my pleasure.

1374
01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:04.689
Just drink a little tea
and relax.

1375
01:23:04.758 --> 01:23:07.655
And I'll just stay
until Marcus comes back.

1376
01:23:09.137 --> 01:23:10.310
This is really good.

1377
01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:12.068
-Glad you like it.
-Hmm.

1378
01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:15.482
Huh-huh-huh!

1379
01:23:15.517 --> 01:23:18.137
Listen to nurse. Tamera. Okay?

1380
01:23:18.172 --> 01:23:20.586
This could wait.
You need to rest.

1381
01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:22.896
Okay. girl.

1382
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:25.724
You know...

1383
01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:31.034
I really am
so lucky to have you.

1384
01:23:32.517 --> 01:23:34.206
Lucky to have you. honey.

1385
01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:51.586
Tam...

1386
01:23:57.724 --> 01:23:59.482
I am really tired.

1387
01:24:02.068 --> 01:24:03.551
It's okay.

1388
01:24:06.758 --> 01:24:09.724
You bitches always thought
you were better than me.

1389
01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.862
You know.
Miles was mine first.

1390
01:24:13.034 --> 01:24:14.724
But once he saw Elisha...

1391
01:24:16.206 --> 01:24:17.896
he forgot all about me.

1392
01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:19.862
Until she had Amaya Grace.

1393
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:23.241
And she was just too tired to
take care of that man's needs.

1394
01:24:23.344 --> 01:24:25.379
It was easy to get him
back in my bed.

1395
01:24:29.344 --> 01:24:35.034
And now Miles can really get
to know his son Ashton.

1396
01:24:38.827 --> 01:24:41.793
It turns out.
I'm gonna get her man...

1397
01:24:41.862 --> 01:24:43.137
and her money.

1398
01:24:55.379 --> 01:24:57.551
Come on. Jordan! Why don't
you pick up the phone?

1399
01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.206
Hmm.

1400
01:25:35.275 --> 01:25:36.551
Babe!

1401
01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.137
Huh-huh-huh!
Ain't no time for that.

1402
01:25:39.172 --> 01:25:42.482
I've been thinking about them
cakes all the day. Come on.

1403
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:43.620
I've been thinking
about my money.

1404
01:25:43.724 --> 01:25:45.034
So why don't you stay on task?

1405
01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:46.655
Who you getting loud with?

1406
01:25:46.758 --> 01:25:48.655
My Crowns soldiers
been doing all the work.

1407
01:25:48.724 --> 01:25:50.206
Running folks and business
outta the Ninth.

1408
01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:51.931
Now stay ready. you feel me?

1409
01:25:51.965 --> 01:25:53.655
I know. baby.

1410
01:25:53.724 --> 01:25:56.965
And you've been doing
such a great job.

1411
01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:59.000
Block by block.

1412
01:25:59.103 --> 01:26:02.655
No one would ever think that
New Orleans' most notorious

1413
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:04.724
hitters was working for me...

1414
01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:06.862
and those blue blood
Harrington's.

1415
01:26:08.034 --> 01:26:10.172
But we did that.

1416
01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:11.896
You're damn right.

1417
01:26:11.965 --> 01:26:15.034
We just have a couple
of loose ends. that's all.

1418
01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.862
Gotta get rid of Jordan
before Marcus comes back.

1419
01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:23.275
Go to the boutique.
get the materials

1420
01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.689
wrap up the body
so we can dump her.

1421
01:26:24.724 --> 01:26:27.344
-We ain't got much time.
-Hmm-hmm.

1422
01:26:27.379 --> 01:26:29.862
Yo. Tam?

1423
01:26:29.965 --> 01:26:31.034
Damn. Dayveon.

1424
01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:33.517
Didn't I just say we
ain't got much time?

1425
01:26:40.379 --> 01:26:42.344
What you 'bout to do. Day-Day?

1426
01:26:42.379 --> 01:26:43.724
I put you on.

1427
01:26:43.827 --> 01:26:45.344
Triple Crowns wouldn't be
gettin' this paper

1428
01:26:45.379 --> 01:26:46.724
if it wasn't for me.

1429
01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.344
Boy. put that gun away.
Quit playin'.

1430
01:26:48.413 --> 01:26:50.172
Sorry. my baby.

1431
01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:51.448
It's time for you to exit.

1432
01:26:51.517 --> 01:26:53.206
so the Crown's
got a bigger piece.

1433
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:56.172
See. no matter
how good that ass is.

1434
01:26:56.206 --> 01:26:57.931
the game always gonna
be the game.

1435
01:27:00.517 --> 01:27:02.413
Ashton needs me.
Please don't do this.

1436
01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:03.758
No. no. no...

1437
01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:21.034
Yeah. It's done.

1438
01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:23.862
I'll move the body.
so you can pin it on the cop.

1439
01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:26.344
Just make sure you come
through on her cut.

1440
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.241
Oh. you waking up. Huh?

1441
01:27:47.275 --> 01:27:48.620
No. huh-huh. huh-huh!

1442
01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:50.482
You shouldn't have been
snooping with that cop.

1443
01:27:50.551 --> 01:27:52.241
you little ass.

1444
01:27:52.275 --> 01:27:55.758
Now you're going to end up dead.
just like you friends.

1445
01:27:57.413 --> 01:28:00.275
But... now we can go ahead

1446
01:28:00.344 --> 01:28:02.551
and have a little fun
together first.

1447
01:28:04.965 --> 01:28:07.827
Yeah! Come here.

1448
01:28:18.344 --> 01:28:21.103
Bitch. you ain't gonna kill me.

1449
01:28:21.172 --> 01:28:22.689
You broke into my house.

1450
01:28:22.793 --> 01:28:25.413
You attacked me.
You killed my friends.

1451
01:28:25.482 --> 01:28:27.068
Why wouldn't I kill you?

1452
01:28:29.862 --> 01:28:32.620
Because I don't want
you to going to jail

1453
01:28:32.655 --> 01:28:34.000
for this piece of shit.

1454
01:28:34.068 --> 01:28:35.655
Oh. you could trust.
I ain't going to jail.

1455
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:37.310
My lawyer will have me
out in the morn--

1456
01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:47.827
I'm gonna enjoy this one.

1457
01:29:08.655 --> 01:29:12.034
Elisha was a... beautiful soul.

1458
01:29:14.137 --> 01:29:16.517
She loved Miles.

1459
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.586
She loved you!

1460
01:29:18.655 --> 01:29:22.689
Tell my son... I did
all of this for him.

1461
01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.724
-Did what?
-Jordan.

1462
01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:28.724
He didn't understand
what needed to be done.

1463
01:29:32.413 --> 01:29:36.551
Miss Elisha... discovered
that the real estate deals

1464
01:29:36.586 --> 01:29:39.586
that were needed
to sustain our family

1465
01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:42.413
after the distillery collapsed

1466
01:29:42.482 --> 01:29:44.310
were being facilitated by that

1467
01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:48.034
bitch Tamera and her gang.

1468
01:29:50.827 --> 01:29:53.172
Come here.

1469
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:56.965
I gave her the land
for the youth center...

1470
01:29:57.034 --> 01:30:00.862
and it still wasn't enough
to appease her ass.

1471
01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:04.310
-So you had her killed?
-Oh. hmmm-hmm!

1472
01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:05.896
Don't do that. Jordan.

1473
01:30:07.655 --> 01:30:09.206
Don't judge me.

1474
01:30:12.551 --> 01:30:15.172
She was going
to sell out our family

1475
01:30:15.241 --> 01:30:18.103
and turn my baby.
my son against me.

1476
01:30:19.655 --> 01:30:21.586
What do you think
is going to happen

1477
01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:24.000
when he finds out
what you've done?

1478
01:30:25.413 --> 01:30:26.724
It needed to be done.

1479
01:30:29.896 --> 01:30:33.586
Brenda Grace Harrington...
I'm placing you

1480
01:30:33.655 --> 01:30:36.655
under arrest for the conspiracy
to commit murder.

1481
01:30:37.862 --> 01:30:40.068
You have the right to
remain silent.

1482
01:30:40.172 --> 01:30:42.551
And anything you say can

1483
01:30:42.586 --> 01:30:45.000
and definitely
will be held against you

1484
01:30:45.068 --> 01:30:46.551
in the court of law.

1485
01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.137
Take her away.

1486
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.551
Huh! Wow!

1487
01:30:56.862 --> 01:31:00.551
How did Tamera and Brenda Grace
even start working together?

1488
01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:03.620
Well. Tamera blackmailed
Brenda Grace

1489
01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:05.724
into cutting her in
on the BlackCourt deals

1490
01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:09.000
or she'd reveal that
Ashton was Miles's son.

1491
01:31:09.068 --> 01:31:12.965
In return. Brenda Grace asked
her to get three Crowns involved

1492
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
to clear out the neighborhood
they were redeveloping.

1493
01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:18.241
And when Elisha found out
about the gang's involvement

1494
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:20.413
with the family's
real estate deals.

1495
01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:25.413
Brenda Grace told Tamera Elisha
had to be dealt with.

1496
01:31:25.448 --> 01:31:27.620
Well. hmm-hmm.

1497
01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:31.172
All right. get this.
when they question Dayveon

1498
01:31:31.275 --> 01:31:34.068
at the hospital last night. and
he realized that he was facing

1499
01:31:34.137 --> 01:31:35.793
the death penalty
for two murders

1500
01:31:35.896 --> 01:31:40.068
and an attempt on your life.

1501
01:31:40.137 --> 01:31:43.482
big bad day to be honest
saying like a canary.

1502
01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:45.448
And told them
all about Tamera's plan.

1503
01:31:45.551 --> 01:31:47.551
But...

1504
01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.482
who did Tamera get to pin

1505
01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:51.448
Elisha's murder on
Ernie Reynolds?

1506
01:31:51.517 --> 01:31:53.275
Hmm.

1507
01:31:53.344 --> 01:31:55.448
Slow down.

1508
01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:57.034
That's our next stop.

1509
01:31:58.275 --> 01:31:59.620
Let's go.

1510
01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.862
Hmm. You know Ernie Reynolds?

1511
01:32:10.931 --> 01:32:12.689
Ernie Reynolds
was Tamera's uncle.

1512
01:32:14.551 --> 01:32:16.034
He molested her for years.

1513
01:32:16.103 --> 01:32:17.689
So he was the perfect
person to take

1514
01:32:17.758 --> 01:32:19.034
the fall for Elisha's death.

1515
01:32:19.103 --> 01:32:20.517
And so. the chief had Ernie

1516
01:32:20.551 --> 01:32:21.931
killed and his car dumped.

1517
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.793
And it was no problem

1518
01:32:23.862 --> 01:32:25.206
that they didn't find
water in the lungs

1519
01:32:25.275 --> 01:32:27.310
because they had Sully
in their pocket. too.

1520
01:32:27.379 --> 01:32:30.034
You just might make
a cute little detective.

1521
01:32:33.827 --> 01:32:35.620
Come on. let's get out of here.

1522
01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:44.620
âª Not afraid to fly
no fear of falling âª

1523
01:32:46.655 --> 01:32:48.655
Wow. well. well. well...

1524
01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.172
Oh. my God.

1525
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:53.344
You look beautiful.

1526
01:32:54.758 --> 01:32:56.655
Thank you.

1527
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:58.793
You clean up nice yourself.

1528
01:32:58.862 --> 01:33:01.275
Oh. do I? Do I take a
look on the left?

1529
01:33:01.379 --> 01:33:02.586
Oh!

1530
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.172
-What. you Eddie Murphy now?
-Huh. I don't know.

1531
01:33:05.241 --> 01:33:07.275
Not!

1532
01:33:07.344 --> 01:33:08.758
Just Marcus.

1533
01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:13.275
Hey...

1534
01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:17.275
You sure you're up for this.
right? We don't have to go.

1535
01:33:17.344 --> 01:33:19.103
They'll forgive you.

1536
01:33:19.172 --> 01:33:20.344
I know.

1537
01:33:21.655 --> 01:33:24.103
But. um...

1538
01:33:24.172 --> 01:33:27.034
I really want to honor
Elisha's memory tonight.

1539
01:33:28.758 --> 01:33:30.310
Thanks for coming with me.

1540
01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:34.931
I'd do anything for you.

1541
01:33:36.482 --> 01:33:37.931
You know I gotcha.

1542
01:33:40.206 --> 01:33:42.137
You know...

1543
01:33:42.241 --> 01:33:48.275
Now that Sully has been put
in jail for falsifying autopsy

1544
01:33:48.344 --> 01:33:53.172
reports and tampering
crime scene evidence.

1545
01:33:53.241 --> 01:33:56.206
you know. our little
old city in New Orleans

1546
01:33:56.275 --> 01:34:01.413
is in desperate need for
a new chief medical examiner.

1547
01:34:01.482 --> 01:34:03.827
Well...

1548
01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:05.827
Maybe it is time
for me to come home.

1549
01:34:08.379 --> 01:34:09.896
Well...

1550
01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:12.724
Welcome home. babe.
