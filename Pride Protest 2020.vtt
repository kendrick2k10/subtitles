3
00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:22.976
First new message.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.910
Hey Blaise it's
Ferhan speaking.

5
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.010
Thank you so much for
getting back to my

6
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.430
application to join your
project Rainbow Films.

7
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.700
I just wondered if it
would be possible to meet

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.630
with you tomorrow.

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.210
I know you're going to be
in Birmingham to film the

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.760
anti-LGBT protests.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.630
As it happens I'm gonna
to be there as well.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.300
So I wondered if maybe we
could just connect while

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.030
we're both there and talk
a little bit about the

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.750
project.

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.120
And maybe you can find
out a little bit about

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.380
what I'm about too.

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.400
Your message will
be saved for seven days.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.790
When I see my
sisters leave the school

19
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.680
and come to me and cry

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.700
and say we are sending our
most prized possession

21
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.540
into a school where they
are messing with our

22
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.610
children's heads.

23
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.220
I will not sit back.

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.560
I don't know about
none of you but I

25
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.780
will not sit back and I
urge you to stand with me

26
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.670
every single time
we protest.

27
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.810
Let kids.

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.480
Be kids.

29
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.480
Let kids.

30
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.470
Be kids.

31
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.490
Listen to

32
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.170
parents.

33
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.170
Listen to

34
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.260
parents.

35
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.500
Listen to

36
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.600
parents.

37
00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:32.699
Listen to

38
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.599
parents.

39
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.320
We will not

40
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.190
step down.

41
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.030
We will not

42
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:36.899
step down.

43
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.840
Don't engage with him.

44
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.020
Why not?
Why can't you engage with me?

45
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.120
He's an Islamophobe
that's why.

46
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.750
I'm not an Islamophobe.

47
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.490
How can I be an
Islamophobe of I'm a

48
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.910
Muslim?

49
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.100
Alright OK would you like
your son to be gay?

50
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.930
Well it's not really for
me to decide whether he's gay

51
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.680
or straight.

52
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.940
He is I know he is.

53
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.780
You are gay?

54
00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.059
You are gay?

55
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.290
Are you asking me
if I'm gay?

56
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.460
I say you are gay?

57
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.260
Well why do you
want to know?

58
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.400
Look like look like.

59
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.990
Because you talking. You
talking in woman and gay.

60
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.650
Are you gay?

61
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.290
Keep away keep away.

62
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.320
I love this jacket.

63
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.060
This jacket looks
amazing.

64
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.000
Amazeballs.

65
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.040
You will not see
homophobic abuse from us

66
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.550
to any

67
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.800
individual of the LGBT
community or the

68
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.100
community -

69
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.830
With all due respect
you don't get to decide who

70
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.160
is homophobic
and or not.

71
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.184
With all due respect -

72
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.008
Our children

73
00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:30.132
Our right.

74
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.680
I'm a queer Muslim
activist and I'm here to

75
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.660
observe the protests
and try to

76
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.490
provide a counter
narrative as a queer

77
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.760
Muslim to be visible as a
Muslim and say actually.

78
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.470
there's nothing in the
faith that compels you to

79
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.220
be homophobic.

80
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.000
Only LGBTQ community can
decide who is homophobic

81
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.700
and who isn't.

82
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.300
Look in this country in
this country.

83
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.910
they can't even define
what Islamophobia is.

84
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.260
They keep saying oooh no
that's not what we're

85
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.130
teaching.
Oooh no.

86
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.250
Well what's this?

87
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.830
What's this?

88
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.760
It's out of your books.

89
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.090
And there are some things
on there that are so

90
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.990
shameful I struggle to
put them up because I'll

91
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.320
myself in disrepute but
the people in that school

92
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.910
don't feel sensitivity
towards it.

93
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.240
Shakeel quick flashes.
quick flashes. that's all

94
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.840
we can do.

95
00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:28.064
Because there are
paedophiles in there

96
00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:30.088
There are paedophiles
in there.

97
00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.112
I can't put half
of it up.

98
00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:34.736
Give it us here.

99
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.060
There are
paedophiles in there.

100
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:39.069
This is a
paedophilia agenda.

101
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.770
People just genuinely
want to have their voice heard.

102
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.980
I think it's a shame that
they have to shout about

103
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.660
it on a megaphone and do
it this way.

104
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.550
but they just seem to
want to have their voice

105
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.600
heard.

106
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.990
Where you from?

107
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.130
Rainbow Films.

108
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.430
Don't worry about them.

109
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.500
I'm gonna do a little
interview with you. So

110
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.000
you you're concerned
about some of the

111
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.800
materials being
shown to kids.

112
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.320
Yeah?
Erm.

113
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.280
And you're gonna show me
some of the materials

114
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.970
that they're showing it.

115
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.450
Definitely.

116
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.800
Okay so what
about this one?

117
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.530
First of all. what we've
got here?

118
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.830
We've got Heather
has two Mummies.

119
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.410
What's wrong with that?

120
00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.109
Men love men.
Okay fine.

121
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.550
Men love men. Fine.

122
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.630
Women love women fine.
Oh. I feel bisexual

123
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.910
okay I'll still look like
a yoyo. fine.

124
00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:24.745
What about transgender?

125
00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.769
What are you telling
our children?

126
00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:28.793
That a boy can
be a girl?

127
00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:30.305
Are you a boy
or a girl?

128
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.580
So let's talk about -

129
00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.729
I'm actually
gender non-binary.

130
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.350
I don't care what you are
it doesn't matter about

131
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.430
what you are
or what I am.

132
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.170
Our children and they
grew up in our

133
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.090
households and we don't
it's not about you.

134
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.080
This is a problem
isn't it?

135
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.880
All of this is very
subjective for you.

136
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.470
You whole life
is about you.

137
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.510
Your whole life is
subjective. It's how you

138
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.140
see things.

139
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.120
And this is we have an
objective viewpoint -

140
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.680
Can we have a look at
some more of them.

141
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.840
There's no need just
stay on that one.

142
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.040
Right do you know what?
There's nothing wrong

143
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.520
with this one.

144
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.840
What do you means there's
nothing wrong with it?

145
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.710
This is where
it's all at.

146
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.120
Are you a boy or a girl
what's the big deal -

147
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.140
Right can I have a look
at some more please?

148
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.260
No. no. no. no.

149
00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:00.089
Why not?

150
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.260
I'll tell you why.
Because there's

151
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.290
a

152
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.910
school down in Slough.
There's another -

153
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.210
Right -

154
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.900
Can I just have a -

155
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.410
Can I -

156
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.100
Can I have these

157
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.870
please or otherwise I'm
not doing this.

158
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.230
Can I just say -

159
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.030
No no give me these -

160
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.470
No I want to look at the
other ones.

161
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.780
It was to just do this
one. I want to do

162
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.620
transgender.

163
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.510
Our children are not
transgender they're only

164
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.080
four and five.

165
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.700
Can I have a look at the
other one.

166
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.960
They belong to him.

167
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.850
Well then how am I
supposed to discuss them

168
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.690
if he's not gonna show
me them.

169
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.740
This discussion needs to
be around them.

170
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.420
Right so let's see
some more.

171
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.650
No. The discussion
needs to be -

172
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.990
Can I have a look at the
other ones please?

173
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.510
And I have to say well a
child of four or five

174
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.490
doesn't know his own
sexuality

175
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.790
he doesn't know
the word sex.

176
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.900
So I think that the
passion that the

177
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.720
protesters are showing
all comes from nothing

178
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.490
more than deep
homophobia.

179
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.330
You should be
representing the parents.

180
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.450
Mum why you having a
debate?

181
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.040
Ooh mum. Is that your
mum?

182
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.500
Can I have a picture with
all of you?

183
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.580
No. no. no. thank you.

184
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.320
Shame on you own
during Ramadan.

185
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.030
What what?

186
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.570
Move from my face.

187
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.150
That's not -

188
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.180
Why well.

189
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.390
Shame on you.

190
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.060
She asked him.
She asked him for his opinion.

191
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.540
No no no.

192
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.680
Aunty asked him for his
opinion.

193
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.710
Aunty asked me.

194
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.940
Unfortunately I've got a
- I made. listen guys.

195
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.450
Just to clarify I made a
video with this man and I

196
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.860
spoke to him very
politely but you know

197
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.340
what he did?

198
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.400
He posted all the videos
on his YouTube except for

199
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.760
mine.

200
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.930
Why? Because he's he's
he's vile arrogant bigot.

201
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.950
Don't talk to him.

202
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.910
I didn't have time.

203
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.830
I didn't have time to do
your video

204
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.750
Right anyway right let's
let's do our video.

205
00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:27.515
You're gonna be
accountable.

206
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.370
You're gonna be
accountable.

207
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.490
Can I - sorry can I just
do this interview please.

208
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.350
No we don't like this
silly business. Have you

209
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.920
got children here?

210
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.370
No. Then why you here
for? Huh?

211
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.790
Can I just do my
interview please?

212
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.660
No no.

213
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.740
Just go away from here.
You're not wanted here.

214
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.940
You're the devils game.

215
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.000
Shameful shameful.

216
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.360
Which one of you here has
ever protested at the

217
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.980
Birmingham
Gay Pride event?

218
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.160
None of us.
None of us.

219
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.880
Yet we have an LGBT
member who wants to come

220
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.950
and try to make out
we are homophobic.

221
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.690
We will protest and
protest and protest

222
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.850
the same way
our brothers and

223
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.870
sisters around the world
take bombs after bombs

224
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.910
after bombs after bombs.

225
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.010
We will protest and
protest.

226
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.020
Even if till my
hair goes white.

227
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.890
I'll carry on protesting.

228
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.960
Everybody has the
right to protest. but we have

229
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.690
the right to show them
how to protest.

230
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.870
And no protest in the
city does it as

231
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.640
colourfully as we do.

232
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.520
A few years ago
Birmingham Pride

233
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.520
helped to fund a project
that at the time we knew

234
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.960
very little about.

235
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.990
And it was called 'No
Outsiders'.

236
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.760
Little did we know how
important and significant

237
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.760
it would be this Pride
weekend.

238
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.980
And our protest this
weekend is one of

239
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.870
tolerance and equality
and togetherness and love

240
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.460
and acceptance.

241
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.210
And that our
relationships are as

242
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.190
important as yours.

243
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.520
And the person who put
all that into a book and

244
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.540
it formed part of

245
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.850
the national curriculum
was a guy called

246
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.910
Andrew Moffitt.

247
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.790
And Andrew Moffitt will
be leading our parade

248
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.130
today alongside
for the first

249
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.880
time in our history two
members of the LGBTQ

250
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.220
Muslim community because
we're walking together.

251
00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:54.145
This is what I want
my children in my school

252
00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:54.869
to see because

253
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.750
this is Birmingham. not
the protests.

254
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.450
This is Birmingham.
looking around me now I

255
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.770
can see different skin.

256
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.080
different religions.
different faiths.

257
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.430
disabilities. LGBTQ+
and it works.

258
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.000
Celebrate Birmingham today
remember wherever you

259
00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:14.480
are whoever you are
there are 'No Outsiders' here.

260
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.970
You need a wristband sir!

261
00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:20.394
Excuse me you need a wristband.

262
00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:22.418
Don't misgender me
because I'm not -

263
00:09:22.442 --> 00:09:24.542
don't touch me.

264
00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:26.566
Don't touch me.

265
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.590
Whoa whoa whoa.

266
00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:32.389
What are you doing?

267
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.390
Look what he's
doing to me.

268
00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:38.914
This is how they
treat people.

269
00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:40.938
Look at them.

270
00:09:40.962 --> 00:09:44.962
Look at the way
they treat me.

271
00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:46.986
Look at the way
they treat me.

272
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.310
Let go.

273
00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:51.334
Calm down.

274
00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:53.358
Let go of me.

275
00:09:53.382 --> 00:09:55.382
Get off.

276
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.520
You can't
let them do this.

277
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.930
So Rainbow Films is a
project that was born out

278
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.060
of a discussion that I
had with

279
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.860
some of our previous
participants in some

280
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.600
shape or form every
single person

281
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.450
in that conversation had
been a victim of a hate

282
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.550
crime like I myself have

283
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.940
numerous times been
attacked. I had a bottle

284
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.200
smashed in my face.
I've been

285
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.220
stamped by rude boys in a
nightclub literally

286
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.740
stamping on my head
because I got

287
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.270
in the way of them
arguing with someone and

288
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.140
then they were
like shut the

289
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.030
fuck up you batty boy and
I got bottled across the

290
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.710
head and then
stamped on the face.

291
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.200
For that kid like me
feeling intimidated.

292
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.850
pestered. harassed by
people just

293
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.760
because they are who they
are. you are not alone.

294
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.070
And just having that
visibility.

295
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.400
I think is so important
to allow people to feel -

296
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.560
You know what. there's
nothing wrong with me.

297
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.930
I'm a human being at the
end of the day

298
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.010
and my sexuality should
not be something that I

299
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.970
feel ashamed about

300
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.470
because other people make
me feel that way.

301
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.580
I basically got
manhandled out of Pride.

302
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.050
And this Pride is
supposed to be about

303
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.890
inclusion.

304
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.660
It's supposed to be about
counter protest against

305
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.650
the homophobic

306
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.840
rhetoric that some Muslim
communities within

307
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.430
Birmingham are spouting.

308
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.960
And me as a gay Muslim

309
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.710
I want to kinda be a
counter narrative to all that.

310
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.870
We've started
a new platform.

311
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.580
It's all about queer
people of colour

312
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.990
and it's all about our
experiences.

313
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.550
It's about the events
that we go to.

314
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.200
It's about the prejudices
that we face

315
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.240
the discriminative
behaviour that we

316
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.440
encounter along the way

317
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.440
and I thought it'd be a
really great idea to get

318
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.230
you involved.

319
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.170
So like how did all this
come about?

320
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.330
A few years ago. I was a
secondary school teacher.

321
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.890
Don't ask me how
that happened.

322
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.260
But the reason why I say
that is because

323
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.010
high school for me

324
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.650
like many queer people
was a place of trauma.

325
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.040
I hadn't actually come
out myself as a gay man

326
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.770
however on my social
media. it was quite

327
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.820
obvious I was

328
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.490
and the students found
out I was gay.

329
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.110
Hi Blaise.

330
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.310
Er you're
not in this class.

331
00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:04.334
Bye Blaise.

332
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.390
Okay. Anyone want to read
out what it says?

333
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.150
What do you think
the intention was?

334
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.940
If it's left on my seat
specifically?

335
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.740
And not just like it fell
off the table but like

336
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.070
literally strategically
placed on the chair.

337
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.900
So when I come back
I will see it.

338
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.510
Okay. well I'm gonna
help you out.

339
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.580
I think it was to shame.

340
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.020
The intention was to
shame.

341
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.870
Considering what you may
or may not know of me.

342
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.770
As a gay man I have
encountered many of these

343
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.790
microaggressions

344
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.470
probably on a daily
basis.

345
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.740
Now. I'm quite secure in
who I am.

346
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.080
It's taken me quite a few
years to get there.

347
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.120
I've been through loads
of things.

348
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.880
So this is kind of like a
minor in comparison.

349
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.470
Yeah. but what it does is
it does kind of bring

350
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.650
back things.

351
00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:04.998
So in my hand

352
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.710
I've got the handwritten
statements that you guys wrote.

353
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.580
This plus this analysis
equals culprit.

354
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.550
You might be feeling your
ears burning

355
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.570
your heart racing

356
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.470
if it was you

357
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.050
if you feel any kind of
guilt or any shame for

358
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.560
what you've done

359
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.700
you'll be feeling that
right now.

360
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.910
Now you multiply that by
every single session

361
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.460
you're going to see me
between now and the end

362
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.150
of the year.

363
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.020
And that's 16 lessons
yeah 16 times two hours

364
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.230
32 hours coming
into this class

365
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.130
seeing me knowing
what you did

366
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.400
knowing that I've outed
you and now you may be

367
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.290
potentially be treated
differently for that.

368
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.610
Okay.

369
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.340
And that doesn't even
come close to what an

370
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.770
LGBT person experiences
in their life when they

371
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.670
go to school

372
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.340
and every single day they
receive

373
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.830
microaggressive abuse
like this

374
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.940
every single day.

375
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.960
It's not a good feeling.

376
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.410
So I'm not going to out
you. I'm not going to

377
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.910
stoop to that level
because that's not me.

378
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.270
I've been there I felt
it. Because I am now in a

379
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.340
position where my
sexuality does not define

380
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.160
who I am. It's how I deal
with it. And it's

381
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.710
situations like this.
that make me who I am.

382
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.560
So I set them this
assignment and it was

383
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.770
basically to create a
three to four minute

384
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.610
video promoting
equality and diversity.

385
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.620
It got shut down
by the year head

386
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.740
who said to the students
that look. you're not doing

387
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.500
it because it's not part
of the curriculum.

388
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.152
So I left my teaching
job and I decided to

389
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.291
work here full time and
this is what I've been

390
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.557
doing for the last four
years. I've been working

391
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.297
with young people.
people of colour

392
00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:41.969
people from the LGBT community
to provide them a safe space

393
00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:46.350
to give them a voice and
help them to challenge stereotypes.

394
00:14:46.374 --> 00:14:48.374
You have an opportunity
to create characters

395
00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:49.698
for people from
your community.

396
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.022
Because if you ain't
gonna do it

397
00:14:51.046 --> 00:14:52.646
no one else it
gonna do it yeah?

398
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.670
So if you keep using
names like John and Sarah

399
00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:56.694
you're gonna get the
same old stale crappy

400
00:14:56.718 --> 00:14:58.718
actors that you see
on TV all the time.

401
00:14:58.742 --> 00:15:01.042
Start creating characters
that are Jassia

402
00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.266
or your Sharonjeets
or Masood.

403
00:15:04.267 --> 00:15:05.315
Or Sufiyan.

404
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.290
Use names like that.
Because this is what

405
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.340
these sessions are about.

406
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.170
So I'm currently training
a team of community

407
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.870
reporters who are going
to go out and interview

408
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.420
queer people of colour
role models and also

409
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.240
identify the various
queer safe spaces that

410
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.780
exist.

411
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.540
What does it mean to be a
queer person of colour in

412
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.320
today's society?

413
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.280
Like I've come out to all
these spaces and what

414
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.410
I've realised is like
it's cool we've got

415
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.060
all these like LGBT+
people but it's all just White.

416
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.260
And it's all just
like anytime I bring up

417
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.050
race everyone just gets
a bit like oh I don't

418
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.220
want to talk about that.

419
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.340
Kind of growing up I
never saw

420
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.080
any Black or B rown faces
that were queer.

421
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.290
Now where I'm at university
and being able to like

422
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.590
do lots of different
things and run my own

423
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.690
projects in order to make
sure that queer people of

424
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.280
colour are heard
in the narrative.

425
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.480
When you are a queer
person of colour it's

426
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.420
not necessarily as
accepted in BAME circles

427
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.430
as it is white circles
so you pretty much have

428
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.930
to find your chosen
family.

429
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.450
Which sharable little
pieces of content can we

430
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.160
create that's
provocative that's

431
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.050
controversial that's
gonna get people talking.

432
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.750
I wanted to do
this video which I think

433
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.120
potentially is going to
get us a lot of hits and

434
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.790
it's basically how gay
friendly is your high street?

435
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:17.650
And what we're
thinking of doing is

436
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.040
having two people kissing
in different high streets.

437
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.250
I'm up for it actually.

438
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.030
Would you do it?
I knew you would.

439
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.690
Because I have like the
structure of what I want

440
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.480
for each verse to be
like. people who feel

441
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.100
like they're kind of
trapped by being South

442
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.990
Asian and being queer as
well. It could be

443
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.910
people's parents like
that they're forcing you

444
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.740
to go one way and then
you feel like you're

445
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.110
losing yourself and the
chorus is just gonna be

446
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.210
like you know maybe I
do wanna live my own

447
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.460
life I want to hold
someone else's hand I

448
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.470
wannna love how
I want to basically.

449
00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:48.494
When I was your age
I never even thought

450
00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:50.518
about coming out.

451
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.939
But because I was
outed by someone

452
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.330
Oh yeah.

453
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.820
I ended up just going
with it and it was the

454
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.320
best thing that happened
to me because I didn't

455
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.600
have to make those
conversations it just

456
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.770
happened and it was fine.

457
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.820
I was outed in school
though but that's how

458
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.670
everyone else knows. I
was only like 13 as well.

459
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.710
I was watching Glee and
then my favourite

460
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.510
character came out as a
lesbian and I was like a

461
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.390
lesbian what's that? So I
got bored and I Googled it.

462
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.150
And then I found out
about bisexuality.

463
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.220
Straight away just kind
of clicked with me so I

464
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.110
told a couple of people
like my friends and they

465
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.700
were like oh yeah
that's chill and then

466
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.560
the next day I came to
school and the entire

467
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.390
school was calling me a
lesbian and I was like

468
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.450
what?

469
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.840
I shared a room with my
brother for 21 years of

470
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.990
my life. he hated me.
Me and him did not get on.

471
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.800
At this age. I knew
something was off and I

472
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.590
definitely knew that I
had feelings that I

473
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.670
shouldn't be having.

474
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.480
What like as in an
attraction or you were

475
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.580
just felt like you're
more interested in them

476
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.060
than you normally
would be.

477
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.440
Yeah it was like it was
a bit of both like

478
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.690
obviously I couldn't
accept the fact that it

479
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.810
as an attraction at that
age I was like gay

480
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.650
is wrong whatever.
I also was like crushing on

481
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.080
this girl in my school.

482
00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:05.604
You know I actually
have a friend he

483
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.050
came out as bisexual when
we were like 14 and

484
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.120
then he came out as gay
when we were 15 because

485
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.760
he was like no. no.
nevermind I like guys.

486
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.430
And it's like so many
people use that as an

487
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.910
excuse to say oh
bisexuality is just a phase.

488
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.020
But I don't understand
that cuz like they

489
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.330
think bisexual people
have it easier we really

490
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.950
don't.

491
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.610
Yeah. I was 24.

492
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.330
Yeah.

493
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.060
The first time I ever
said it to someone.

494
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.350
I got to a point where
I was clearly

495
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.340
attracted to men.

496
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.820
Right.

497
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.730
But I was like I don't
want romantic

498
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.660
relationships with them

499
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.400
because they all suck.

500
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.390
Like all the men in my
life I never got

501
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.460
on with my brother I
don't get on with my dad.

502
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.260
And then I fell in love
with my straight best

503
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:44.800
friend.

504
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.610
Right.

505
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.820
And that went on
for like a year.

506
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.290
What did he look like?

507
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.850
Okay. so he's like.

508
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.070
a white guy.

509
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:54.460
Right.

510
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.440
Blonde hair.

511
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.910
He had a very
like cute face.

512
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.450
Like soft boy.

513
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.310
You were
describing that there's

514
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.590
like a certain type of
personality and like

515
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.510
attitude that comes with
people that grew up in

516
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.960
Southall so you're not
really like attracted to

517
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.950
those kind of guys?

518
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.470
No like I'm

519
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.920
not really.

520
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.960
Because all my friends
are jokingly be like

521
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.660
oh you always go for
like the white guy.

522
00:19:17.668 --> 00:19:20.313
But they say that and the
thing I immediately go

523
00:19:20.324 --> 00:19:23.803
back with is like because
those are the only

524
00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:25.127
I meet.

525
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.230
I still have such a crush
on Chun-Li I don't even get it.

526
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.100
I'm just like fully love you
and want to be you.

527
00:19:31.124 --> 00:19:33.624
Just like all kinds -
just everything.

528
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.070
Oh I see the guy you're
talking about.

529
00:19:36.094 --> 00:19:37.178
The one by the wall?

530
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.480
Yeah the window.

531
00:19:38.504 --> 00:19:40.304
Yeah he cute.

532
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.300
Paki.

533
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.220
Towelhead.

534
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.510
Whore.

535
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.250
Slut. greedy. sex
obsessed.

536
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.540
Slave.

537
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.560
Mulan.

538
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.990
Dark chocolate.

539
00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.360
Ladyboy.

540
00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.120
Oriental.

541
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.080
Nigga.

542
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.040
Jackie Chan.

543
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.990
Yellow face.

544
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.830
Golliwog.

545
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.210
When you're East Asian
people have either have

546
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.980
this idea that you're
going to be very sexually

547
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.420
provocative or naughty.

548
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.640
And he was like. oh.
you're not full Asian

549
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.730
right? When you're full
Asian like they're

550
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.810
generally not good
looking.

551
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.970
Obviously there's a big
issue with racism.

552
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.750
When you try and bring
that to light sometimes

553
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.210
a lot of people act like
you're trying to make

554
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.680
things up or you're
trying to divide the

555
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.470
community when obviously
it's stuff that's

556
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.180
happened to you.

557
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.060
Stonewall and a lot of
historical queer history

558
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.830
was brought about by
queer people of colour

559
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.900
and that's something we
mustn't forget. We wanna

560
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.520
be part of the
community but there's not

561
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.610
always a space for us.
I think more inclusivity is

562
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.860
very important which is
why I'm really eager and

563
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.420
looking forward to
UK Black Pride.

564
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.240
The power I have in my
privilege of being able

565
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.430
to stand up as an out and
proud bisexual Muslim.

566
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.920
When I do see people of
colour who only date

567
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.780
White people I try not to
be judgmental.

568
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.510
A lot of the time some of
it can stem from

569
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.710
internalised racism.

570
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.830
You know the idea that
oh well you know I'm

571
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.590
just I'm just attracted
to who I'm attracted to.

572
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.660
It's like what how come
you only date White girls

573
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.800
though? You know that
there's something else

574
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.320
there that that informs
that attraction perhaps

575
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.590
it's something else that
you're trying to escape

576
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.060
or that you don't want to
deal with.

577
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.400
Or in the case of White
people the validation

578
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:24.670
right?

579
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.920
Right or the
or the validation.

580
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.780
I acknowledge that a
couple years ago I was

581
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.130
like I've got Master
syndrome

582
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.090
right I don't know if
that's a thing.

583
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.740
I found myself like
looking for that

584
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.410
validation in White men
right. Like I needed them

585
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.890
to find me attractive to
fuck me hard to like to

586
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.860
to go there in order for
me to feel desirable or

587
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.760
sexy.

588
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.950
And I'm trying very hard
to dismantle that

589
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.520
thinking.

590
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.240
I'm certainly one of
those black guys who for

591
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.190
a time saw validation in
Whiteness and so I

592
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.290
always pursued White men
always felt more

593
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.820
flattered when a White
man thought I was

594
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.560
attractive and I
realised just how

595
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.470
colonised that thinking is.
I think sexual racism

596
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.120
is a thing and I think
it's something that we

597
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.250
have to grapple with both
as people of colour but

598
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.260
also that White men
really need to get their

599
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.050
head around that all of
our desires our

600
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.240
preferences they come
from somewhere right?

601
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.190
We don't exist in a vacuum.
I've written about this

602
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.250
before you know this
this idea that we somehow

603
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.830
arrive at our desires
without any input from

604
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.350
the external world is
wildly inaccurate.

605
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.190
And I think people are
really scared to confront

606
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.120
sexual racism because
they see themselves as

607
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.340
not racist and I think
there's also this weird

608
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.650
thing that happens with
desire or when it's when

609
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.920
racism is couched in
desire it's somehow not

610
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.040
racism. right? But it is
right the reduction of

611
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.580
people to their exterior
parts to their skin tone

612
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.370
to their blackness to the
size of their penis

613
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.290
like that's all racist.

614
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.280
I went through a
very public shaming

615
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.520
I lost my job my past was
kind of thrown in my

616
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.210
face and I was hurting
and I was having these

617
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.070
really beautiful conversations
with people who

618
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.690
were kind of rallying
around me and as I was

619
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.800
having these conversations.
I was like oh my god

620
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.060
people need to hear this right

621
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.640
they need to hear the
wonderful collected wisdom

622
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.280
of our community and
you know these were

623
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.710
predominantly queer black
people who were using

624
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.050
their own life experiences
their own mistakes

625
00:23:24.074 --> 00:23:27.169
their own adversity
to help bolster me

626
00:23:27.193 --> 00:23:29.193
to say you're gonna
get through this

627
00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:30.817
you messed up
but you'll get

628
00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:31.941
back up again

629
00:23:31.965 --> 00:23:33.765
take time to heal
and just kept giving

630
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:35.189
me this amazing
advice.

631
00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:37.213
You know Busy Being Black
is a healing project

632
00:23:37.237 --> 00:23:39.437
its a way for me to
connect with my people

633
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:43.061
and to learn from
people about how they are

634
00:23:43.085 --> 00:23:46.285
healing. thriving. living
at this kind of

635
00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:49.009
messy intersection of
Blackness and queerness.

636
00:23:49.033 --> 00:23:51.033
18 months in and
I feel like I'm just

637
00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:53.257
now getting the
confidence to say

638
00:23:53.281 --> 00:23:55.281
hey what I've made is
actually shit hot

639
00:23:55.305 --> 00:23:56.605
I'm good at this.

640
00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:02.829
We are so honored to
be occupying this space

641
00:24:02.853 --> 00:24:04.853
with so many queer
people of colour.

642
00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:06.877
Oh my gosh
isn't this wonderful

643
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:10.701
a sea of beautiful Black
and Brown faces and allies.

644
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.920
UK Black Pride is about
people over profits.

645
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.230
UK Black Pride is about
recognising that our

646
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.020
personal is political and
our political is

647
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:35.180
personal. UK Black Pride
is about love. pain. joy.

648
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.950
success. and you'll find
that all in one place.

649
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.210
And that one place
is the family.

650
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.770
Being an openly gay
police officer was

651
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.790
probably the easiest job
I did. I never received

652
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:59.030
any abuse for being queer
because they really don't

653
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.690
care as long as you can
do the job as long as

654
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.520
you've got their back
when things happen you

655
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.290
could be anything.
You could be a green alien.

656
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.890
When it comes to the
public I only had one

657
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.140
incident and that was on
a boxing day night shift

658
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.980
at four o'clock in the
morning two people had

659
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.540
really brutally beaten up
this person and ran

660
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.400
away and we ran after then
I caught one of them and

661
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.420
I sat on him and he said
'Get off me you queer

662
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.530
black bastard.'

663
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.810
I just stayed sitting on
him didn't say anything

664
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.650
didn't retaliate.

665
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.860
And then I put it in my
statement and it wasn't

666
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.470
till the next day the
sergeant in control of

667
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.450
the investigation came up
to me and said you didn't

668
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.880
arrest him for racially
abusing you. I was

669
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.770
like I just thought it
was the part of the job.

670
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.710
He's like. no. Is the
organisation overall

671
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.400
institutionally racist?
Yeah. it is. Definitely.

672
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.320
Do you know if I wasn't a
queer person of colour. I

673
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.260
wouldn't be so outspoken.
I wouldn't have craft

674
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.230
myself into an
entrepreneur. I very much

675
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.790
believe that being gay
has pushed me to have to

676
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.580
say. no one is going to
help you. You're going to

677
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.280
have to do this yourself.
So it's very much crafted

678
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.410
and moulded who I am
today. I mean. that's

679
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.660
also why I'm part of
Black Pride. And it's

680
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.040
really hard when you've
got people saying there

681
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.570
shouldn't be a Black
Pride. Why do you have a

682
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.200
Black Pride?

683
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.530
If we lived in an ideal
world we wouldn't need

684
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.520
Prides. But we do. We
don't live in an ideal

685
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.420
world. We have racism. we
have Islamophobia. We

686
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.660
have so many forms of
discrimination. And

687
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.430
that's why UK Black Pride
is needed.

688
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.040
When we rise.

689
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.570
I wish I got involved in
the community when I was

690
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.780
younger. I'm 33 now I
think if I just had the

691
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.910
community around me when
I was a bit younger and

692
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.370
I could relate things to
people without having to

693
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.430
think about it myself in
my bedroom and think this

694
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.250
is just the way it is
that's just not just the

695
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.250
way it is and there's
people that can help.

696
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.950
You know that understand
what you're going through.

697
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:23.430
UK Black Pride.

698
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.880
Yeah cuz like I haven't
come out to my parents

699
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.980
but like. I mean my
siblings like I think

700
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.080
they have like an inkling
that I'm queer because

701
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.700
like. I'm just queer.

702
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.360
If I were to give anyone
advice. I would probably

703
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.040
say. to not feel the need
or pressure to tell

704
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.970
everyone right away. I
when I was younger made a

705
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.860
pact with myself that I
would come out of the

706
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.360
closet even though I
didn't know what that

707
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.480
meant. When I was older
and lived on my own and

708
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.040
finished my school and
was financially

709
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.220
independent. It wasn't
until my parents asked me

710
00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.040
at 19 which was on my
timeline. seven years too

711
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.140
early that I just
decided to just get it

712
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.270
over with right away. The
beautiful thing is people

713
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.620
have the internet and
people are not telling

714
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.450
their stories. So it's
like you don't have to

715
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.370
learn from your own
mistakes. I think it's

716
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:10.930
really important to do
the research now that

717
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.770
it's available to learn
that you are valid. You

718
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:19.210
are allowed to be queer.
you are not a disrespect

719
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.280
to your family. You are a
completely and

720
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.770
unconditionally lovable
and if other people don't

721
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.780
immediately show you
that. that you will find

722
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.550
those people who make you
believe again in your

723
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.190
life. To like learn that
as a fundamental pillar

724
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.620
of courage and strength
before you start coming

725
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.030
out to people who don't
have your best interest

726
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.840
during that moment.

727
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.910
It has been a dream of
mine to collaborate with

728
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.310
the Tate in any capacity
and the fact that they've

729
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.950
allowed us to like throw
a Hungama as well as do

730
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.580
an LGBT night as well as
celebrate Sridevi is like

731
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.970
beyond my imagination.
And so I thank you from

732
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.400
the bottom of my heart.
And I just want to say

733
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.650
that tonight is not just
about us. It's not just

734
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.770
about the LGBT community.
It is about Sridevi and

735
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.690
it also is about her
Perdes Simplay who passed

736
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.540
away last week. He ran
Saathi for 18 years in

737
00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.570
Birmingham. He was a
legend. I never met him.

738
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.120
but he always messaged me
with nothing but support.

739
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.070
And he's like Hungama's
great. Keep doing it. And

740
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.050
when I found out he
passed away. I was

741
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.320
devastated. Because like.
the earth lost an angel.

742
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.150
And so tonight we
celebrate for him. okay?

743
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.090
For me the reason why I
came to these events is

744
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.670
because I never really
found the safe space

745
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.510
where I am from. Because
I live in West London in

746
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.450
Southall it's a very
closed off community. And

747
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.180
growing up I never really
knew anyone else who was

748
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.240
queer like me. So it was
really tough trying to

749
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.640
find trying to find
somewhere where I felt

750
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.340
like I could accept my
identity as

751
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.370
bisexual as well as being
Indian.

752
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.090
You'd be doing me a bad
favour if you didn't

753
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.060
follow him on Instagram.
Battyman Arun.

754
00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:01.084
Battyman Arun.

755
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.940
Once you go through all
of that oppression and

756
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.830
all the challenges and
obstacles of coming out

757
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.200
and trying to find your
community it is so

758
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.330
devastating to walk into
the doors of places that

759
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.040
you're supposed to be
welcomed. and still feel

760
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.250
alone. Like it's like
getting to the end of a

761
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.120
desert and when you find
that like small fountain

762
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.790
of water

763
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.840
realising it just run dry
like is it can be really

764
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.380
harrowing.

765
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.020
And then after the first
song. we go into each

766
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.940
song you don't know
what they are

767
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.390
performing your hardest.
live your best Madhuri

768
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.170
Dixit life.

769
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.100
Live your best
Aishwarya life.

770
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.650
Live your best
Sridevi life.

771
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.790
Live your best life.

772
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.960
I think it's important
for people of colour to

773
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.250
to have their own queer
safe spaces because we are

774
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.800
as wonderful as we
are different and to pretend

775
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.020
that we're one way to
pretend that we're one

776
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.560
genre of music or to pretend
that we're one tone

777
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.240
or colour in a room
is fools errand.

778
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.810
You need to be
who you are. Who you are

779
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.120
is the only way this
world's going to change

780
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.960
for the better.

781
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.600
I wish my mom was here.

782
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.700
Okay cool. On with the
programme.

783
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.030
We are not homophobic.

784
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.900
We are not homophobic.

785
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:21.920
We are not homophobic.
We are not homophobic.

786
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.850
We are not homophobic.

787
00:31:23.874 --> 00:31:25.874
We are not homophobic.

788
00:31:25.898 --> 00:31:27.898
We are not homophobic.

789
00:31:27.922 --> 00:31:29.819
We are not homophobic.

790
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.860
Let kids be kids.

791
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.370
Let kids be kids.

792
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.750
I mean like

793
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:40.020
she was passing the mic
to her child to say our

794
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.250
kids our choice.

795
00:31:42.174 --> 00:31:45.174
A lot of control
going on of children.

796
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.290
Very sad.

797
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.670
We are not homophobic.

798
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.370
Do you oppose are you
opposed to LGBTQ

799
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.260
relationship education in
primary school?

800
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.390
No I've not got a problem
with it but you know

801
00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:57.970
I've got -

802
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.710
Humza can I ask
you a question? Sorry to

803
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.190
interrupt you.

804
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.850
Sorry he's speaking.

805
00:32:01.874 --> 00:32:03.874
Do you agree
with this?

806
00:32:03.898 --> 00:32:05.898
When goldpants crapped
his underpants?

807
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.030
You're not letting
people speak.

808
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.760
The truth. The truth. The
truth about Ferhan Khan.

809
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.530
So Pride is supposed to
be an event for everyone

810
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:23.800
right?

811
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.400
With wristbands.

812
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.140
Now unfortunately.
they're putting profit

813
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.830
before Pride.

814
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:35.950
Look at they way they're
manhandling me because I

815
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.630
haven't got a wristband.

816
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.500
Look at that.

817
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.500
Is this Pride?

818
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.600
This is Pride.
It's not about profit

819
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.800
It's about the guns
isn't it?

820
00:32:42.824 --> 00:32:45.709
It's about the White people
telling what people are doing.

821
00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:48.233
For goodness sake.

822
00:32:48.257 --> 00:32:50.009
Look at these guns.

823
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.930
For people that haven't
got tickets.

824
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.620
Have you seen that video
online? Because

825
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.760
I'm shook by what people
have said online. I'm

826
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.940
gonna go to other Prides
and show that this is not

827
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.630
who I am.

828
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.900
It's fabulous to be here
at the most inclusive

829
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.410
Pride

830
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.480
in history London 2019.

831
00:34:06.004 --> 00:34:07.804
Pride is amazing.

832
00:34:09.328 --> 00:34:10.328
Woooo.

833
00:34:13.152 --> 00:34:15.152
You are so cute.
Can I have a kiss?

834
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.820
How racist is the
LGBTQ community?

835
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.520
I've experienced it
firsthand absolutely.

836
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.730
Definitely through dating
apps. in person in bars

837
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.560
in gyms. everywhere.

838
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.850
So what do you think
about cultural

839
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.510
appropriation?

840
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.940
I love your T-shirt.

841
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.370
Tell us what's your
favourite sexual

842
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.870
position or need we ask?

843
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.610
What do you think of the
protests going on in

844
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:37.330
Birmingham?

845
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.100
We need to start with
inclusive education from

846
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.060
the very beginning.

847
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.580
A lot of fear is based
upon ignorance so you

848
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.050
know the people who are
protesting I'd

849
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.510
encouraged them to
educate themselves and

850
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.980
love and live
and let live.

851
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.170
I think at the end of the
day we gotta express

852
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.890
this with love.

853
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.680
Parents are protesting
against kids being taught

854
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.000
not to be homophobic.

855
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:09.024
Oh fuck them.

856
00:35:09.048 --> 00:35:10.699
You wanna lick pussy
lick pussy.

857
00:35:10.723 --> 00:35:11.299
You wanna do this
do that.

858
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.010
You wanna suck dick?
Suck fucking dick.

859
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.930
Brrrraap.

860
00:35:17.955 --> 00:35:19.955
Pop your number
in my fucking phone.

861
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.910
I'm not gonna lie I'm a
little a bit nervous today.

862
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.540
I'll tell you why.
I got a whole Channel 4 team

863
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.830
filming this for
national TV innit so

864
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.110
I'm low key bricking
it a little bit.

865
00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:36.234
Yeah so I'm presenting
a documentary on

866
00:35:36.258 --> 00:35:37.858
young people's
mental health

867
00:35:37.882 --> 00:35:41.582
and this night is just
incredibly important for

868
00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:44.406
platforming conversations
and creative ways of

869
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.430
expressing a conversation
about this topic.

870
00:35:47.254 --> 00:35:49.254
We are holy

871
00:35:49.778 --> 00:35:54.978
We are holy in liquid
size and sweat soaked skin

872
00:35:55.002 --> 00:35:57.002
I cannot tell

873
00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.500
where she ends and I
begin as love interweaves

874
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.680
through estuaries of limb
in this tapestry of

875
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.720
brown. It is not a sin.
it is a call to prayer

876
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.430
wherever my name leaves
her lips with devotion.

877
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:18.980
I know that God is here.
Whenever I am with her.

878
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.050
I know that God is here.

879
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.410
By opening up too much.
sometimes we can kind of

880
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.200
like be more vulnerable
than you you're prepared

881
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.210
to be. Yeah. I mean. I
felt like that when I

882
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.100
first came out in the
scene at the age of 15 /

883
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.490
16 years old. things
weren't great at home. I

884
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.250
came out and that didn't
go down so well with my

885
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.710
family. So I needed a
community just to like

886
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.460
embrace me and love me
and just be be where I

887
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.500
could find a home and I
thought that was the

888
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.770
LGBTQ community in
Glasgow in London. But

889
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.920
unfortunately what I
experienced wasn't the

890
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.740
cultural understanding
that I needed. the racial

891
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.750
understanding the
understanding of my lived

892
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.080
experience of racism up
to that point at school

893
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.570
you know because I had
come with those traumas

894
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.420
and the White people that
I was meeting on those in

895
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.730
the LGBTQ community
weren't able to

896
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.970
understand that trauma.
you know. but if we're

897
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.310
prepared with the
information empowered

898
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.990
with the information. we
can actually really.

899
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.890
really help each other.

900
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.920
So much. there's so much
potential for healing so

901
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.660
much but I think you're
right it's just not

902
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.000
being scared to have
those conversations.

903
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.110
Hey.

904
00:37:25.134 --> 00:37:26.234
Hello hello.

905
00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:27.604
Hey.

906
00:37:27.605 --> 00:37:28.865
How's it going?
This is Phoenix.

907
00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:30.029
We brought
guests.

908
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.129
Hi Phoenix.

909
00:37:31.153 --> 00:37:33.153
Say hello.

910
00:37:33.177 --> 00:37:35.177
Hi babe.

911
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.300
Prides.

912
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.105
Okay so you haven't been
to any of the Prides yet

913
00:37:38.129 --> 00:37:39.099
have you?

914
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.390
No I literally
missed all of it.

915
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:41.740
You gotta go to Bi Pride.

916
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:42.859
Bi Pride's coming up.

917
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.620
Wait. there's a Bi Pride?

918
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.940
I met Ferhan at the
protests at the

919
00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.590
Birmingham Protests.
Amazing. I was just like.

920
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.840
Oh my God. just just the
way you actually just

921
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.400
just spoke to them and
confronted them.but it

922
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.170
wasn't like patronising
it was just like just

923
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.820
straightforward
questions and they

924
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.920
revealed their own
prejudices and it was

925
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.760
just great to see that.

926
00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.630
It's like when you catch
at bitch out.

927
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.410
And the next day you was
at Birmingham Pride.

928
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.730
Birmingham Pride wanted
to promote the message of

929
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.080
inclusion and have
Muslims queer Muslims

930
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.790
like us just at the
front. The rest of the

931
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.630
queer Muslims were doiing

932
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.490
interviews. So I thought
you know what

933
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.020
I'm quite bored here
I don't know anyone.

934
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.960
So I'm gonna leave. So I just
went up to the security guard

935
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.960
and said I'm just going
to go but is there anyway

936
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.370
I can get a wristband
just to come back in later on?

937
00:38:20.394 --> 00:38:21.069
Oh okay.

938
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.830
So then they cottoned on
that I didn't have a wristband.

939
00:38:23.854 --> 00:38:27.454
I saw you go in and
I knew that you had access

940
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.280
so when I saw the video
I was just like what?

941
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.780
Maybe I was resistant to
leaving I guess you

942
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.900
know. but I don't think
that I deserve to have my

943
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.110
head caught in a
headlock. And for my face

944
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.750
to be smashed against the
floor of the concrete.

945
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.270
Now the protesters are
using that ammunition and

946
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.520
saying okay well this
is your activist. This is

947
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.610
what the gay
community is.

948
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.540
You see that's what's so
irritating about these

949
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.890
protests is that no one's
teaching these like five

950
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.110
year old children about
like gay sex they're

951
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.360
telling you that this is
what is out there in the

952
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.910
world. You can't hide
truth from children.

953
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.840
It's also understanding
like that we need to be

954
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.540
teaching our children how
to love healthily and

955
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.790
that love manifests in
all different ways and

956
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.250
we can love each other in
so many different ways.

957
00:39:08.274 --> 00:39:10.399
And that's it.
It's such a basic concept.

958
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.450
That becomes politicised
and used to oppress.

959
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.840
Because we touched on
escapism and how that

960
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.240
like can take place in so
many different forms like

961
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.450
drugs but actually how
we can escape ourselves

962
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.270
through Whiteness is
real you know and

963
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.640
trying to like be
anything but what we are

964
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.920
in a White world through
loving someone who's

965
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.920
White and trying to like
like for me I was with

966
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.860
you know I've only
had White partners really

967
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.870
and like like as in in
terms of committed long

968
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.710
term relationships.

969
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.870
I mean I've just been a
slag all my life so I

970
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:47.140
don't discriminate. Brown.
Black. green. yellow.

971
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.960
I grew up in a very Asian
area. maybe if I'd been

972
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.790
put up in a White area
then I would have just

973
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.000
gravitated towards who
was local to me. For me.

974
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.130
I've always had Asian
partners like right from

975
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.910
the get go.

976
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.490
I am breaking this
stereotype within my head

977
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.390
this urge within me to
like go after someone I

978
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.240
was socialised to find
attractive someone light

979
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.670
skinned you know I'm
challenging myself.

980
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.030
Do you think

981
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.190
it's rebellious in a way?
Are you doing it

982
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.140
out of protest?

983
00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.990
You know it unfortunately
is but it's the most

984
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.310
rewarding protest I've
ever done.

985
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.310
Well I'm sure it was
after what I heard about

986
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.390
a certain someone.

987
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.050
You know with
Rainbow Films I did a

988
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.910
little interview with
this very very

989
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.600
attractive Black guy.

990
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:34.570
Good for you man you
gotta do what you gotta do.

991
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.820
We chatted a little while
after that and he came

992
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.430
over here. That's right.
That's the tea. He came

993
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.220
over here. We had sex
right here outside in the

994
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:43.490
garden.

995
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.360
On this table?

996
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.720
No just underneath on the
floor and then like we

997
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.580
were rolling around and
then he took me upstairs

998
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.790
and he gives me the most
intense anal orgasm I've

999
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.140
ever had in my life.

1000
00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.230
Well let's cheers to
Ferhan's sexual

1001
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.070
emancipation.

1002
00:40:58.094 --> 00:40:59.494
Yes.

1003
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.200
When we rise. it's about
community. It's about

1004
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.040
love.

1005
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.910
UK Black Pride is a
political statement. It

1006
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:20.030
is by us and it for us.

1007
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.510
Aaron.

1008
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.080
Hi Aaron. Shahmir.

1009
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.040
How are you alright?

1010
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.630
Together we are
Mar/Comms.

1011
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.370
We're Mar/Comms of UK
Black Pride.

1012
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.790
OK sick.

1013
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.540
Here goes.

1014
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.390
She's ready. That didn't
take long.

1015
00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.650
From a comms perspective.
Like I'm always answering

1016
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.900
the question like why UK
Black Pride is important.

1017
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.210
And the only people who
asked that question have

1018
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.330
never been to UK Black
Pride. And you can tell

1019
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.400
because people who've
been would never ask that

1020
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.090
question. If I didn't
define myself for myself.

1021
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.090
I would be crunched into
other people's fantasies

1022
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.740
for me and eaten alive.

1023
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.940
Maybe I should just say
that. Yes. Lord.

1024
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.020
Mashallah.

1025
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.130
Babe I cried at first UK
Black Pride.

1026
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.360
That's because
you're a faggot.

1027
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.970
Okay guilty. Yeah also
because

1028
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.660
I'm just kidding.

1029
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.990
But also because seeing
all those like Black and

1030
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.780
Brown bodies was so
intense. When we get into

1031
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.340
that space that is so
healing that like I

1032
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.350
don't think anyone brings
trauma with them into the

1033
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:24.170
UK Black Pride space.
Whereas with mainstream

1034
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.480
Prides we're kind of we
never get to let our

1035
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.700
guard down. Also at UK
Black Pride you don't

1036
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.890
have to wave a rainbow
banner to be there. Yeah.

1037
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.110
Whereas like with
mainstream Prides and

1038
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.690
not just in the UK but
all over the world. Like

1039
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.130
it seems like a
prerequisite for

1040
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.010
celebration that you're
covered in rainbows and

1041
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.140
actually what we see UK
Black Pride is a

1042
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.300
demonstration of culture.

1043
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.750
Mario Mieli suggests that
homosexuality is natural

1044
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.120
because it's a form of
self love. Like of

1045
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.790
course you'd be
attracted to the same sex

1046
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.260
because you love
yourself.

1047
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.930
Like there's so much
discord in our community.

1048
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.840
And that's
not just across

1049
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.230
racial lines but it's
across gender and gender

1050
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.720
identity and I think
there's so much division.

1051
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.730
We want everyone to come
to UK Black Pride.

1052
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.770
I think it's important to
have allies there at UK

1053
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.720
Black Pride but I also
think it's important for

1054
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.600
allies to recognise that
for us as queer Black

1055
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.580
and Brown and Asian and
non White people that it

1056
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.060
is so rare for us to have
a space where we can

1057
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.670
truly be ourselves.

1058
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.510
I believe that telling
our stories first to

1059
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.450
ourselves and then to
one another and the

1060
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:41.880
world is a revolutionary
act. Growing up I've

1061
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.740
been policed a lot about
the way I present myself.

1062
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:52.800
It's not been the easiest
to fit into society's

1063
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.100
norms or ideals of what a
person should look like

1064
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.790
or behave like our appear
like and being a

1065
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.280
Bollywood dancer that
comes with added

1066
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.950
difficulties because
Bollywood as an industry

1067
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.880
is very heteronormative.
There are a lot of toxic

1068
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.160
narratives queer
characters aren't given

1069
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.130
that sort of privilege
and that sort of respect

1070
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.760
to be full fledged
characters. They are seen

1071
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.690
as almost caricatures and
for comic relief. So it's

1072
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.300
all about questioning and
challenging that through

1073
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.080
performance and art. And
that's what we did

1074
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.000
through the London School
of Bollywood which I'm

1075
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.820
which I'm a part of and
we went on to Britain's

1076
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.010
Got Talent we addressed
gender fluidity we

1077
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.740
brought that to the
forefront using dance.

1078
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.730
And we did get backlash.
Yes because

1079
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.750
understandable I guess
because people aren't

1080
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.570
used to this kind of
visibility. But honestly

1081
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.390
the love and the positive
feedback that we got

1082
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.930
trumped it all we had
judges standing up we had

1083
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.480
audience members standing
up we've had people from

1084
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.560
all across the world send
messages of Support. I've

1085
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.950
had loads of people come
up to me sharing their

1086
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.950
personal stories coming
out to me and sort of

1087
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.470
finding comfort in that
visibility that we were

1088
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.660
able to create through
our dance.

1089
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.340
Shall we change
it up me on top?

1090
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.740
So just a
couple more.

1091
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.110
That's nice actually.

1092
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.720
Well as South Asians we
just don't even mention

1093
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.910
those subjects we don't
talk about sex sexuality

1094
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.090
mental health and that's
a problem. Me Him Us

1095
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.030
that's testing for me to
protect me testing for

1096
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.230
him to protect him the
partner and protecting us.

1097
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.100
All of us. It's like some
important for our

1098
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.140
community to like come
together. I don't think

1099
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.840
we do that enough. We're
too busy like bickering.

1100
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.110
Well exactly like this
Photoshoot today means a

1101
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.480
lot to me because it's
like we're just showing

1102
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.010
that we can be intimate
with each other.

1103
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.310
Yeah.

1104
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.920
An that can be on on
billboards across the city.

1105
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.210
Like how often do you see
South Asian queer love.

1106
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.910
I've never seen it.
I don't know if you saw I'm

1107
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.870
gonna be on a panel.

1108
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.810
I did. I'm so
excited for you.

1109
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.810
And I need your advice
because you've been on

1110
00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.950
like you're like famous
'I'm on panels everywhere '

1111
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.790
I'll give you it all.
I'll spill the tea.

1112
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.520
So what do I do?
I'm so nervous.

1113
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.460
You're such a smart
intelligent guy you're

1114
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.420
gonna be really good at
it I really believe in you.

1115
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.280
Oh it's just like so I'm
talking about like.

1116
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.890
bisexuality and being a
person of colour and that

1117
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:28.260
like intersection in it
all. Like when you start

1118
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.150
talking about this kind
of stuff every time I

1119
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.820
have I upsetting people.

1120
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.690
If I know anyone that
knows bisexuality and the

1121
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.370
intricacies of that
it's you.

1122
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.720
I don't shut up about it.

1123
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.260
Wow. she thinks she's
gonna have a problem

1124
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.480
going on stage taking
about it? Like it's a

1125
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.070
problem stopping you
talking about it.

1126
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.890
So obviously the family
situation is very tense.

1127
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.230
And I don't want people
to like jump on me like

1128
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.490
if I see something wrong.

1129
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.210
When I went to Birmingham
and I encountered the

1130
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.880
protesters in Birmingham.
I got some backlash from

1131
00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.310
the Muslim community like
why are you disagreeing

1132
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.230
with these protesters?
Why are you sexualising

1133
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.750
our children? You're
gonna face this backlash.

1134
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.800
That's what makes us so
strong and brave and beautiful.

1135
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.210
I'm just gonna lean on
you and be like help me.

1136
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.300
I've got you I've got you
sister. Yeah.

1137
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.380
Right so we're here at
Philly's place.

1138
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.730
She wants to shoot today
about your alter egos.

1139
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.320
And in this case I'm
kind of doing like a Desi

1140
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.130
superhero.

1141
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.360
I'd rather it looks
strong. bold masculine.

1142
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.580
Cool.

1143
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.650
Basically everything that
I'm not.

1144
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.270
Like that please. I was
planning on doing this

1145
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:04.110
shoot yeah. I was gonna
get Vaneet and Ferhan to

1146
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.860
kiss in different high
streets and then get

1147
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.730
people's reactions.

1148
00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:13.270
Like you'd risk probably
getting beaten up. no?

1149
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.330
Is there that?

1150
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.310
But I mean the fact that
you just said that says

1151
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:17.820
it all innit.

1152
00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.780
Yeah. totally. I get
scared because I'm just

1153
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.950
like what do we have to
do to prove

1154
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.960
I personally wouldn't do
it I'd shit it.

1155
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.540
But then obviously Ferhan
and Vaneet are quite bold

1156
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.990
in that sense.

1157
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.680
So they probably would
do. So I'm gonna talk to

1158
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.220
them about it.

1159
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.850
Hey babe. where
are you at?

1160
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.640
I'm outside
the building.

1161
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.410
Okay. cool. I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna send

1162
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:37.430
Philly to come and get
you yeah?

1163
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.000
If you just come round if
you just come round the

1164
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.410
front Philly's gonna come
out now.

1165
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:43.210
Okay he's Philly.

1166
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.680
Okay wicked cheers.

1167
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.960
Go on.

1168
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.220
You're not gonna be
kissing your little

1169
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.290
boyfriend on the street
I've got a fucking son.

1170
00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.290
You're not gonna do it no
you're not. You do that

1171
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.310
behind closed doors.

1172
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.040
Do you think we're gonna
stop now you said.

1173
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.850
You do what you want.

1174
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.210
It not something my son's
gonna see. My son's not

1175
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.070
gonna grow up like you to
think it's right to get

1176
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.210
stabbed in your ass.

1177
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.020
Fucking batty.

1178
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.470
Excuse me?

1179
00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:07.449
Batty boy.

1180
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.390
Philly I feel like the
more visible I've gotten.

1181
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.670
the more vulnerable I've
gotten to hate crime.

1182
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.700
Coming out as queer on
national television

1183
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.090
straight after that I got
recognised in the street.

1184
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.030
This group of South Asian
guys in a car and I'm

1185
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.160
assuming must have been
Muslim but they

1186
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.930
recognise me so they must
have been watching that

1187
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:33.430
programme. 'Hey. you're
that gay bastard.' And

1188
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.000
then they pursued me
whilst I was on my bike.

1189
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Which wow okay.

1190
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.980
Yeah they pursued me
down the street and then

1191
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.400
they slowed down to like
basically just stop and

1192
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.250
hurl abuse at me. I mean
they did actually find

1193
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.250
the perpetrator. Okay
because I recorded the

1194
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.940
number plate.

1195
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:50.840
Well done.

1196
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.420
And they took me in for
an identity parade but

1197
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.360
get this. Right. So I go
to the police station.

1198
00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.880
There's two police
officers there. The first

1199
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.130
one talks me through the
process he says 'you're

1200
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:02.870
going to do an identity
parade it's going to be

1201
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:05.780
on video.' And I instantly
recognise the

1202
00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.530
perpetrator.

1203
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.950
Right.

1204
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.210
So I was like oh it's
number six police officer

1205
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.040
and he's like 'oh. right
you okay sure?' And I was

1206
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.260
like yeah I had a
feeling might be number

1207
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.220
ten. But I'm sure it's
number six. He like oh

1208
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.680
okay. So then we finish
the interview and then we

1209
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.300
take it takes me to
another room. He's like

1210
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.940
you identified the
correct perpetrator. But

1211
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.040
because you mentioned
another perpetrator the

1212
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.990
case has collapsed. We
can't take any further

1213
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:28.440
sorry.

1214
00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:30.369
What?

1215
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:30.910
Yeah.

1216
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.690
Poke my eye out.

1217
00:50:46.714 --> 00:50:48.714
Poke your eye out
with what?

1218
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.580
I want to be comfortable
with myself publicly

1219
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.130
I want to you know let
everyone know that I am

1220
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:10.050
bi and I love it but
I'm just scared of

1221
00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.620
the consequences.

1222
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.260
I might not have
a home.

1223
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:20.110
If I literally come out
then my parents will

1224
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.930
literally kicking me out
if they see this you

1225
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.780
know my Dad he's always
just like oh you know

1226
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.270
he's always talking about
how he wants this kind of

1227
00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.020
perfect life with me and
some Indian guy and when

1228
00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.030
I was younger and I
first came out I got so

1229
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.670
much shit for it.
I was literally bullied to

1230
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:39.160
absolute hell and I
finally gotten over that.

1231
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.140
I don't know how I'm
supposed to kind of live

1232
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.870
this public life but
still somehow hide in my

1233
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:45.730
own home. I have to
sacrifice one or the

1234
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.160
other. And I don't know
which one it's going to

1235
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.040
be. I don't know I don't
know which one it's going

1236
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.430
to be. I really want to
do this. But that's why

1237
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:56.380
is this so hard because
I'm thinking if I do

1238
00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.610
this there's
no going back.

1239
00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.470
Yeah.

1240
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.020
I'm quite excited with
what Hungama has managed

1241
00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.260
to achieve in the last year.
It's been one year

1242
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.270
since I started doing the
party monthly and it's

1243
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:27.430
been maybe a year and a
half since I started

1244
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.070
doing the party in
general. I basically just

1245
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.390
got to a point where I
was working in fashion

1246
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:33.430
for like almost 8 years
and art and I was

1247
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.700
just feeling very like
isolated. I felt like the

1248
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.560
only queer person. the
only Brown person. the

1249
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.260
only Canadian person. And
so I just had a case of

1250
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.880
the fuck its and I was
like I'm just gonna

1251
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.560
throw a Bollywood party
and I'm just gonna invite

1252
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.050
whoever wants to come
that really gave me this

1253
00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.780
the foundation to keep
doing them even though I

1254
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.400
didn't know if they were
going to work. Keep doing

1255
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.810
them even though they
weren't making money.

1256
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.580
Keep doing them even
though I had no idea what

1257
00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.310
I was doing. And it was
things like yoga.

1258
00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:01.180
meditation. mindfulness.
I mean I've taken CBT

1259
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.250
therapy I've like I
learned how to meditate

1260
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.940
off YouTube. I listened
to podcasts about like

1261
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.410
how to believe in
yourself when I go to

1262
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.560
sleep and I thought what
better way to finish off

1263
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.250
our series of one year
anniversary things than

1264
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.800
by just doing that
altogether and actually

1265
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.940
being and collectively
sharing that experience.

1266
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.610
I've been singing
forever I'm from

1267
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.600
Leicester wasn't really
getting anywhere that

1268
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.850
exciting there just being
pigeonholed a lot of

1269
00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:30.560
people telling me 'oh we
should sing like you know

1270
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.300
Punjabi' but I'm like
babes I can't even talk

1271
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.000
it. I don't even know
what you want me to do.

1272
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:39.590
So I like run away moved
to London at 17 and I've

1273
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.070
been trying to like carve
a lane for myself. And I

1274
00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.960
think I really come into
my artistry since I've

1275
00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.990
found my community of
like queer POC queer

1276
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.800
South Asians because it
wasn't until I found the

1277
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.290
support of people like me
that I felt I could like

1278
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.930
authentically be myself
in my music. For a long

1279
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:59.000
time. I believe or not
was pretending that I was

1280
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.620
straight like people were
going believe it.

1281
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.440
Honestly it was like yeah
because I didn't think

1282
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.680
get signed especially as
like a South Asian guy.

1283
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.270
First of all I was
trying to pretend I

1284
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.000
wasn't Brown.

1285
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.020
wasn't Brown.
I was just like I've just
got a tan like I'm mixed

1286
00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.520
I was just like I've just
got a tan like I'm mixed

1287
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.540
race.

1288
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.750
I was not a coconut.
I just didn't want to

1289
00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.720
adhere to a lot of the
kind of pressures that

1290
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.180
are put upon me you
know being queer like

1291
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.070
you said was out of the
question. So I think even

1292
00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.850
by me exercising my
queerness even as

1293
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.990
pretending to be
straight but I just

1294
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:38.750
couldn't help it. It was
it like it was it just

1295
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.210
wasn't it wasn't it
wasn't Brown to them.

1296
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.550
That was very you know
but then it's so funny

1297
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:45.200
because the same people
that are calling me that

1298
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.210
used to call me coconut
I'm now going back home

1299
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.440
and trying to have
conversations with them

1300
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.810
about white privilege.
And they're like 'no you

1301
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:53.450
know don't don't rock
the boat.' Like first

1302
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:54.830
like okay I don't
understand am I a

1303
00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.920
coconut? Or am I a White
person hater? Like what

1304
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:58.880
really is it?

1305
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.700
I'm much more interested in
having a conversation with a

1306
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.370
South Asian person my age and
ask them why are they

1307
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.260
perpetuating an archetype
that doesn't exist in

1308
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.240
their own family homes?
Why are they pretending

1309
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.740
they don't drink? Why
they pretending they

1310
00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.330
don't smoke? Why they
pretending they don't

1311
00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:13.520
have sex. I was like
because you're actually

1312
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.640
creating a huge unsafe
area about like all these

1313
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.170
tripwires that come up
when they start doing

1314
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:20.600
this without proper
knowledge without these

1315
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.340
issues actually coming to
light. And I was like

1316
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.590
and creativity is when
like we as creatives

1317
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.870
learn all this stuff in
the trenches. And like

1318
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.310
it's important for us to
come together so having

1319
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:29.210
this conversation.

1320
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.140
Oh my god I loved it so
much. When we came in

1321
00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.810
there's already so much
that we could relate to

1322
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.520
everyone in the room we
don't even have to say

1323
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.280
anything and everyone's
already had the same you

1324
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.860
know South Asian queer
experience the same

1325
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.600
trying to figure out

1326
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.000
themselves. There's such
a problem that we face

1327
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.860
with trying to balance
our identities with being

1328
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.590
South Asian in Britain
and then being queer

1329
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:53.660
in such a straight
environment. So it was

1330
00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.240
really nice hearing
someone say it out loud.

1331
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.550
And it made me feel like
it's okay to be South

1332
00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:01.010
Asian and it's okay to be
British. It's okay to be

1333
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.050
both at all times
I don't have to tone

1334
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.330
anything down. And I
really really like that

1335
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.150
because I want to kind of
own that more.

1336
00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:16.379
Standby.
Roll camera.

1337
00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:18.150
Action.

1338
00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:18.930
I'm queer.

1339
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.890
I'm here. Closets are for
clothes not for people.

1340
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.230
I'm bi what are you gonna
do about huh?

1341
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:26.550
What you gonna
do bitch?

1342
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.330
We're here. we're queer
we will not live in fear.

1343
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.950
We're here. we're queer.

1344
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:35.190
I spent so many years
suffering in denial. I

1345
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.050
don't want anyone else to
experience that pain.

1346
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.840
I'm here. I'm queer. And
I'm a Muslim. I exist

1347
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.740
get over it.

1348
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.470
The more we put ourselves
out there and the more

1349
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.290
visible we are. The more
we can contribute to

1350
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.230
normalising queer people
of colour within society.

1351
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.020
You are wearing
underwear yeah?

1352
00:56:59.050 --> 00:56:59.950
Huh? Yeah.

1353
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.350
Good. No one wants
to see that.

1354
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.770
Don't worry honey it's
not for you.

1355
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.980
Don't worry honey
I don't want it.

1356
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:09.560
No one's asking.

1357
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.970
The shade.

1358
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.360
Basically with Rainbow
Films we're in a really

1359
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.370
great position because
we're working with a lot

1360
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.380
of community
organisations and through

1361
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.060
them I've been able to
get in touch with some

1362
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.870
really great people and
I think for us we're

1363
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:46.390
trying to create a
platform that enables

1364
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.020
people to have a voice
and empowers them and

1365
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.570
it's about visibility
about seeing people that

1366
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.120
look like them talk like
them from the same

1367
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.540
neighbourhoods and
they're living great

1368
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.270
lives. They're living
happy lives as open

1369
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.320
people. It's just made me
so much more comfortable

1370
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.350
in my skin in terms of my
sexuality. It's given me

1371
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:09.010
a purpose.

1372
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.720
It's allowed me to
connect with people.

1373
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:10.960
I think so.

1374
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.200
And I just don't feel the
shame. I don't feel that

1375
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.770
shame of being out or
people know.

1376
00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:23.610
Could we maybe have maybe
just silhouettes of crew.

1377
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.510
Yeah.

1378
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.610
With a boom pole and a
camera and stuff.

1379
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.090
I'm extending his
love to you here today.

1380
00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:41.090
Giving you the
opportunity to repent.

1381
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.600
What can I do
to repent for you?

1382
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:46.730
Turn to Jesus Christ.

1383
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.090
Yeah?

1384
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:48.530
And renounce
homosexuality.

1385
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.670
Why is that a problem
for Jesus Christ.

1386
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:51.830
Because it's a sin.

1387
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.840
Where does it say
it's a sin?

1388
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.830
First Corinthians.

1389
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:56.920
Yep.

1390
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.980
And chapter six
from verse nine.

1391
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.670
Read it to me.

1392
00:59:00.694 --> 00:59:02.794
Show me exactly where
it says it's a sin.

1393
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:04.040
Do you wanna read it
together?

1394
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.080
I can't read.

1395
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.850
It says do you not know
that the unrighteous will

1396
00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:10.170
not inherit the kingdom
of God? Do not be

1397
00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:12.530
deceived. In other words
don't try to convince

1398
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:13.560
yourself that it's okay.

1399
00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.600
If God lives inside you
is that the same as

1400
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.190
myself entering you?

1401
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:21.810
No. your perception of
what the Bible says is

1402
00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:23.760
very different to what
God actually means to say.

1403
00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.810
You are no more
Christian than I am.

1404
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:27.130
I am about a
baptised Christian.

1405
00:59:27.154 --> 00:59:28.654
I don't think you
actually Christian -

1406
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.520
Oh really? So you're out
here judging me too.

1407
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:32.440
You wouldn't be out here
opposing the word of God.

1408
00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.430
I am opposing to the
word of God? I am

1409
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:35.670
opposing you.

1410
00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.720
Do not judge people.
God is the judge -

1411
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.810
Thank you very much for
your comments and trying

1412
00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.580
to oppose the word of
God but I'm going to

1413
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.410
continue preeching now.

1414
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.910
You think I'm opposing
the word of God?

1415
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.800
As I was saying to my
friends everyone has the

1416
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.660
freedom to either
contribute to the support

1417
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.570
of this practice and
continue to live in sin

1418
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.960
or turn away from sin and
make peace with God.

1419
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.110
Because my friends only
those who obey Jesus

1420
01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:05.080
Christ and live according
to his teaching be

1421
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.900
allowed into His kingdom.
And the same way you live

1422
01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.600
in this country. you have
to abide by the law.

1423
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.700
For me I used to be a
drunkard I used to be a

1424
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.010
liar I used to be a
theif. I used to you know

1425
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.860
take drugs. I used to go
to the club. I used to be

1426
01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.200
a bigger sinner. So I'm
no better than these

1427
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.840
people I'm just set apart
by the grace of God.

1428
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.090
And I've had my sins
forgiven and so -

1429
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.770
Are you gay?

1430
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:26.800
Yes I am queer.

1431
01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:27.160
What?

1432
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.510
Queer Pakistani Muslim
woman.

1433
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.380
What do you mean queer?

1434
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:31.920
Well it's a reclamation
of that word because -

1435
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.810
I remember queer back in
the days in the 70s.

1436
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.490
So the idea is it was
used as a derogatory term.

1437
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.450
Yeah queer.

1438
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.570
And we are we reclaiming
that in a powerful way to

1439
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.710
say that this
is who we are.

1440
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.210
What do you think the
implications are for

1441
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.620
people coming out
especially for black

1442
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.490
people coming out?

1443
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.140
It's horrible. And it
makes you go lulu

1444
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:50.830
mental.

1445
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.810
Well you know know
what I mean I'm just

1446
01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:55.630
talking straight. You
know when you're mental

1447
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:56.290
you're mental.

1448
01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.000
I mean -

1449
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.250
I mean -
A normal mental.

1450
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.200
A normal mental.

1451
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.810
And then there's the gay
mental. Sorry.

1452
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.350
I mean I'm gonna say like
that term is politically

1453
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.760
incorrect because I'm a
psychologist.

1454
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.620
Right there's normal
mental you're mental.

1455
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.150
You're off key.

1456
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:12.810
And there's a mental
where you can't express

1457
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:17.070
yourself and your
feelings to people and it

1458
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.560
gives you a bit of a
mental feeling.

1459
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.900
Listen some people want
to commit suicide.

1460
01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.280
Naz and Matt Foundation
started in 2014 sadly

1461
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.670
as a result of my fiance
and soulmate Naz sadly

1462
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.000
taking his own life two
days after his family

1463
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
confronted him about his
sexuality. The start of

1464
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.880
the breakdown was
actually Naz being

1465
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.940
criticised because he
didn't want to go to a

1466
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.190
family funeral. And the
reason why he would not

1467
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:46.110
go want to go to that
family funeral is because

1468
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:49.050
he was sick and tired of
being been asked 'Why

1469
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.400
aren't you married?' And
then he said on the phone

1470
01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.860
and I'll never forget
this. He said I've told

1471
01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.550
them. Now there's no
build up to this

1472
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.700
conversation so I
thought that's why I

1473
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:06.660
asked him - told them
what? And then even

1474
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.900
though he was on the
phone that I couldn't see

1475
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.150
his face. I could hear.

1476
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:18.840
I could hear that huge
breath that he took when

1477
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:27.110
he said everything. I've
told them everything and -

1478
01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.980
I've been in that
Pakistani home where

1479
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.280
you're carrying you
know so much weight

1480
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.070
constantly and I think
shame is the way to speak

1481
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.230
to a lot of this and what
I think a lot of people

1482
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:43.370
carry for just being who
they are and if you're

1483
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:46.070
not having a place to
speak to that to let that

1484
01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:48.650
weight to come off or for
that to be met with love

1485
01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.520
or acceptance. it rots
you on the inside it

1486
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.610
completely like I don't
have words to put to that

1487
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:59.540
and I can only imagine
what he was carrying to

1488
01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.940
that point in which it
was just there was no

1489
01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.370
other way out and I've
been to those places

1490
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.100
personally and I think
that we need to be

1491
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.590
speaking more about the
consequences in terms of

1492
01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.110
our mental health and
especially when it comes

1493
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.780
to intersections of
particular identities and

1494
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.960
families that are
repeatedly shaming you

1495
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.990
know and cultures are
repeatedly shaming us for

1496
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:22.040
who we actually are.

1497
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:26.210
My pleasure is my
power my moan becomes a protest

1498
01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:28.130
against all I have ever
been told.

1499
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.090
You attempt to reprimand
me every time that you

1500
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:31.690
tell me.

1501
01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:34.990
I'm supposed to try hard
to make roti and dhal.

1502
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.500
I'm supposed to steer
clear of queer company.

1503
01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:41.730
I'm supposed to grow my
hair and wear salwar kamaaz

1504
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.060
I'm supposed to find a
nice aadmi to take care

1505
01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:44.870
of me.

1506
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.900
Well I would daringly
care to disagree.

1507
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:51.860
But please let the
flowers of my Pakistani

1508
01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.310
powers interweave with
ease through my identity.

1509
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.000
My love is not limited
to body parts.

1510
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.760
It is about the passion
that seers between two

1511
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.760
human hearts and there
is no part of you that

1512
01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.660
will make me feel shame
for who and how I love.

1513
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.550
Can I have a talk
with you?

1514
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:11.680
What's up?

1515
01:04:11.704 --> 01:04:13.443
I was speaking to
Manpreet and she was

1516
01:04:13.444 --> 01:04:15.588
saying that you were
having a chat with her.

1517
01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:17.948
And you were saying
that you don't

1518
01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:20.550
think like bisexuality is
real or something.

1519
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't know what it was.

1520
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.380
I don't know what it was.
No no no I didn't say
that in the conversation

1521
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.610
No no no I didn't say
that in the conversation

1522
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:26.160
I was talking about my
own personal experience.

1523
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.140
And I was talking about
how when I was growing

1524
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.510
up. I kind of said to my
friends and everyone else

1525
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:33.690
that was bisexual and I
go to me it seems like

1526
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:34.980
Vaneet is doing
the same thing.

1527
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.676
That's so invalidating.
Like I told you my story.

1528
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.300
I told you how
hard it was.

1529
01:04:39.324 --> 01:04:40.324
I told how it
was like

1530
01:04:40.348 --> 01:04:42.348
I didn't know if
I liked women

1531
01:04:42.372 --> 01:04:43.572
I didn't know if
I liked men

1532
01:04:43.596 --> 01:04:45.196
because I kept
flipping back and forth

1533
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.320
I didn't have a
term for it

1534
01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:47.644
so I didn't know
what the hell I was

1535
01:04:47.668 --> 01:04:48.668
I thought I
was weird.

1536
01:04:48.692 --> 01:04:50.692
I don't think you realise
how difficult it is to be bi

1537
01:04:50.716 --> 01:04:52.716
you're saying its easier
and it'll soften the blow

1538
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.340
but we have like higher
rates of suicide

1539
01:04:56.364 --> 01:04:58.364
and depression
and anxiety

1540
01:04:58.388 --> 01:05:00.388
we're less likely
to come out.

1541
01:05:00.412 --> 01:05:02.412
And it's horrible because
we go out into the LGBT+

1542
01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:04.436
community then we
get people like that going

1543
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.460
'You're not actually bi
though. you're gonna come

1544
01:05:06.484 --> 01:05:08.484
out as gay later.
you'll choose a side.'

1545
01:05:08.508 --> 01:05:09.609
We're not gonna
choose a side.

1546
01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:10.510
This is my Mum.

1547
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:15.149
And this is brother in
law Tunde.

1548
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.140
My whole family's here.

1549
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:19.940
You'll be fine.

1550
01:05:19.964 --> 01:05:21.964
You'll be amazing.

1551
01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.320
This guy pops off on
Twitter twenty four

1552
01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.140
seven. In real life its
gonna be the same thing.

1553
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.910
I'm gonna be like Twitter
but in real life.

1554
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.100
Watch me watch me.

1555
01:05:30.124 --> 01:05:31.399
You will never like not be

1556
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.230
like oh I can't think of
something to say.

1557
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:34.890
Oh yeah no I mean I'm
always gonna have

1558
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:35.580
something to say.

1559
01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.840
Hi everyone it's very
loud very loud person

1560
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.980
I apologise. So I'm a queer
person of colour.

1561
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.910
My background is Indian. I
identify as bisexual and

1562
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:50.210
queer. I also do writing
in my spare time and I

1563
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:52.460
was published in the
Bible Volume 2 which

1564
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.350
you may have seen
being sold here today.

1565
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.960
I can't remember a time
were I didn't feel

1566
01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:00.500
othered honestly. I grew
up in Southall and it's

1567
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.230
a very South Asian area
and it was rife with

1568
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:07.580
toxic masculinity which
we all love and when I

1569
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.470
finally did come to terms
with my sexuality and I

1570
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:13.460
finally did come out I
went into LGBT+ spaces

1571
01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.070
and it was lovely to have
all these LGBT+ friends

1572
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:18.320
apart from the fact they
just didn't want to talk

1573
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.090
about race.
They just didn't.

1574
01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.690
Anytime I bring up
cultural appropriation.

1575
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:26.750
Anytime I bring up
preferences. Yeah it's

1576
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:31.940
not preference mate any
single time I would say

1577
01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.490
this stuff people there
would always be at least

1578
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.920
one person in the room
would be like 'can you

1579
01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.620
just stop talking?' And
they just didn't want to

1580
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.560
hear because all of them
were just White cis gay

1581
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:42.740
men.

1582
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.390
So I was like right well
I need to go somewhere

1583
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:48.480
else. So I found queer
people of colour spaces

1584
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.190
and you think well okay
maybe that will be

1585
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.530
better but just like
with the White cis gay

1586
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:54.360
spaces biphobia existed.

1587
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.670
Oh my god
congratulations.

1588
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.940
You look
so gorgeous.

1589
01:07:03.964 --> 01:07:06.364
Aw I love it.

1590
01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:09.064
We're gonna walk
past and see us

1591
01:07:09.088 --> 01:07:11.088
on the street.

1592
01:07:11.112 --> 01:07:13.112
Oh that's
gonna be so lush.

1593
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.570
Do you drink diet Coke?

1594
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:20.490
I normally drink normal
Coke it will do. I'm not

1595
01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.870
that much of a queen just
coz I'm on photos now.

1596
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.930
For people of colour
it's always like one or

1597
01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:27.400
the other. Either you're
ignored or you're

1598
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.390
fetishised.

1599
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.570
And for me I'm always in
the ignore category

1600
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:32.820
because like there's so
many other things on top

1601
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.830
of me being Asian that
just don't like.

1602
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.570
Is it easy to
tell that I'm Asian?

1603
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:37.529
Yes.

1604
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:40.020
You can still tell
because your eyes

1605
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:41.550
there's a lot of space
around your eyes.

1606
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:42.930
So shall I put some
foundation on.

1607
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:44.950
Pretend to be
White for a day?

1608
01:07:44.974 --> 01:07:46.649
You're gonna go to a

1609
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.940
circuit party and just
pretend that you're

1610
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.850
White that's what
you wanna to do?

1611
01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:51.350
Yeah I'd be
more successful.

1612
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:54.530
And when it happens just
be like suprise bitch.

1613
01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:56.850
Look you kissed
a Paki.

1614
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.500
I haven't tested my
limits to be honest but

1615
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.220
if I were to test my
limits again then I

1616
01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.990
guess I would use the
ultimate penetrating

1617
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:08.180
cream. I have had to
train myself up a bit

1618
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:11.450
first. But spit is quite
popular these days.

1619
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.310
That's what you want
really a spit and shove.

1620
01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:17.610
I don't know if you're
aware actually but I

1621
01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:20.430
only ever go for an
uncut dick. I like mine

1622
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.750
nice and haram.

1623
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.650
I'm growing my
foreskin using -

1624
01:08:26.674 --> 01:08:28.074
How'd you grow
foreskin?

1625
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.210
It's using a foreskin DTR
called a dick restorer

1626
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.130
But you're Muslim I'm
Muslim were circumcised -

1627
01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:35.154
Yep foreskin restorer.

1628
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.620
So you can stretch your
skin and all of the skin

1629
01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.060
cells when you separate
them they start to

1630
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.820
undergo mitosis so they
replicate. So you can

1631
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.510
replicate all of those
skin cells from your

1632
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.150
foreskin a little bit
that you got left.

1633
01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.879
Yeah I got a device and
it pulls it everyday

1634
01:08:51.903 --> 01:08:53.903
while I'm at work
under the desk.

1635
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.590
Yeah but it takes about
6 months or 8 months.

1636
01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.480
I don't know if you're
lying to me.

1637
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.920
It's called intactivism.

1638
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.770
Everyone on Grindr is
like oh you're gonna be

1639
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.810
my like sub bottom boy
and I'm like other way

1640
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.440
round sis.

1641
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.540
Don't let the hair fool
you. Don't let the Asian

1642
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.080
fool you.

1643
01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.630
Oh look
douche cleansing.

1644
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.690
I just hate all of these
like sub communities.

1645
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:17.130
And fact that they're
like let's have a flag

1646
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:19.170
and I'm like why? You're
not a marginalised group.

1647
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.050
And when we get a flag
with black and brown

1648
01:09:21.074 --> 01:09:22.549
stripes suddenly
it's like oooh.

1649
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:23.990
'No you can't
be a group

1650
01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.950
because that's racist.'

1651
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:27.510
But you can have
a bear flag.

1652
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.080
Only do things that
you're absolutely

1653
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.700
comfortable with. Don't
feel any pressure to do

1654
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.350
anything that you don't
want to do of course.

1655
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.490
If at any point you guys
feel like you're in

1656
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.950
danger just shout out a
safe word or a code

1657
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:41.780
word. Yeah what would
you want to use?

1658
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:42.870
Pineapple.

1659
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:44.370
OK pineapple.

1660
01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:48.550
And then I've got this
DJI so this is a gimbal.

1661
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.440
So I'm going to be
basically hovering around

1662
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.450
you looking like a
pervert following you

1663
01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:54.730
like this. The point of
it is to see how gay

1664
01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:56.770
friendly or queer
friendly the high street

1665
01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:58.660
is so it might even be
that people like don't

1666
01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.500
even batter an eyelid.

1667
01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:03.040
I feel like we haven't
actually been on the

1668
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.260
date this is like our
first date but like

1669
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.780
recorded
which is weird.

1670
01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.450
Yeah.

1671
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.860
Pronouns are he him they
them. When I was like 13

1672
01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.750
I used to wear boys
clothes all the time. I

1673
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.120
was actually secretly
happy on my friend broke

1674
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.380
the head off my Barbie.

1675
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.960
About three years ago I
experienced homophobia

1676
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.610
where I work. I used to
work in finance as a

1677
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.160
trader in Canary Wharf. I
basically interviewed for

1678
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.500
the job as a feminine and
I kind of became more and

1679
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.570
more masculine towards
the end of my time there.

1680
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:38.210
And that became a bit
confusing for them so it

1681
01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:39.800
didn't really go so well
and then I ended up

1682
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.470
getting bullied for it
and like my hands were

1683
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.990
like shaking at work and
shit. Yeah.

1684
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.400
How bullied like how?

1685
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.660
Swearing laughing
jeering.

1686
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:53.220
They would walk
past me and then

1687
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.550
click pens and be like 'when
she's gonna get fired?

1688
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.040
Does she know she's
gonna get fired?

1689
01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.290
Who's gonna
fire her?'

1690
01:10:59.314 --> 01:11:02.114
So I ended up with PTSD
and it took me 2 years

1691
01:11:02.138 --> 01:11:03.138
to recover.

1692
01:11:03.162 --> 01:11:05.762
Day one my parents
couldn't even hug me

1693
01:11:05.786 --> 01:11:07.286
they couldn't come
into my room

1694
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:08.910
because I'd have a
panic attack I was

1695
01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:10.409
that scared of
people.

1696
01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.780
I had to relearn how
to eat in public how to

1697
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.330
read how to write in
public like I literally

1698
01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:17.250
couldn't work at all for
like two years.

1699
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:18.470
People who have a problem
with it well I'm like

1700
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.420
people already had a
problem with me before so

1701
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.190
I am a Black trans man.

1702
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.500
I'm starting to feel a
bit uncomfortable.

1703
01:11:33.524 --> 01:11:35.524
You're so nervous.
Look at you.

1704
01:11:35.548 --> 01:11:37.548
I am
a bit nervous.

1705
01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.590
Those guys they're
like three of them.

1706
01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:01.300
They saw that I saw them
and they started like

1707
01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.150
just looking but like

1708
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:05.500
very intensely.

1709
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.520
Some people were curious
or some people were

1710
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.960
getting a bit aggressive.

1711
01:12:12.935 --> 01:12:14.935
How vegan does it taste?

1712
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.100
It actually tastes like
sausage.

1713
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.090
Hey hello.

1714
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.440
Yeah I'm just a bit
concerned that I think

1715
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.960
the more I become who I
am as an individual it

1716
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.610
means that I'm going to
have to deal with like

1717
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.190
more prejudice like my
partners will have

1718
01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:31.700
prejudice.

1719
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.880
My children are going to
have prejudice. It's just

1720
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.160
gonna be a lot of pain
for a lot of people.

1721
01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.980
Just because I want to
accept who I am as as an

1722
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.900
individual.

1723
01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:41.720
I went through hell and
I've come on the other end

1724
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.350
so I should speak
about what happens it

1725
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:45.490
doesn't happen
to anyone else.

1726
01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.810
You should see how she's
looking at us.

1727
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.090
You should see it.

1728
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.270
She's horrified.

1729
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.020
Horrified?

1730
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.350
Yeah.

1731
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:52.770
Oh.

1732
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.530
She's just like.
analysing us and

1733
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:55.980
everything.

1734
01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.670
I think she thinks I
can't see her.

1735
01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.760
Everyone is watching
us on the bus.

1736
01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.500
Yeah I know I know.

1737
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.010
Everyone is.

1738
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Yeah we should actually
go on like an actual date.

1739
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.100
You're cool.

1740
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.020
This is where
I grew up.

1741
01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:38.650
Yeah.

1742
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:42.190
I've spent most of
my life here.

1743
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:42.790
Sure.

1744
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:45.520
I wasn't out when I was
here to be out and being

1745
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.450
in Southall and like it's
exactly what I thought it

1746
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:49.810
would be.

1747
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.380
You're right.

1748
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:52.990
I've not seen a single
person walk by who hasn't

1749
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.710
had a look.

1750
01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.330
And the looks are not
positive looks.

1751
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:57.920
If looks could kill.

1752
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.240
It just confirms for me I
could never be out here.

1753
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.190
It could never come to
Southall and be out and

1754
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:03.940
be whatever.

1755
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.360
Okay.

1756
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.690
I just live my life
without reactions or

1757
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:09.720
without feeling unsafe.

1758
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:09.730
without feeling unsafe.
For me when I come here
to a place like this

1759
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:11.670
For me when I come here
to a place like this

1760
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:15.510
where I see people of my
culture living their

1761
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:18.150
lives but not really
changing their mindsets.

1762
01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:21.210
I'm very inclined to
change their mindset by

1763
01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:22.590
public displays of
affection.

1764
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:22.860
Yeah.

1765
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:26.010
So for me is very like
I'm not gonna like hold

1766
01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:28.350
back I want to like full
on kiss I might even

1767
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.280
take my clothes off.

1768
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:31.370
I used to come to this
high street all the time.

1769
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.070
I'm pretty sure I used to
come to dentist here. My

1770
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.560
family used to have a
business here.

1771
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:40.130
Like this. this is my
this is everything to me.

1772
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:41.810
This is this is this is
my whole life.

1773
01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:44.850
You have a connection a
personal. heartfelt

1774
01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.810
connection to this area.
And you you want to be

1775
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:51.270
fully accepted for your
whole self when you're

1776
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.660
And it's sad because
like. no matter what

1777
01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.990
happens in my life. no
matter where I go. a tiny

1778
01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:00.670
piece of my heart will
always be here.

1779
01:17:19.194 --> 01:17:20.894
It's Beyonce.

1780
01:17:20.918 --> 01:17:22.918
Happy Black Pride.

1781
01:17:24.242 --> 01:17:26.242
Oh my god.
Look at you.

1782
01:17:30.466 --> 01:17:31.866
Look at that this.

1783
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:33.990
Why does it look
like Glastonbury?

1784
01:17:34.014 --> 01:17:35.069
What have you done?

1785
01:17:35.093 --> 01:17:36.969
That stage is immense.

1786
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.230
We got a little bit
more money.

1787
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:42.210
If I say UK
you say Black Pride.

1788
01:17:42.234 --> 01:17:43.134
UK

1789
01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.058
Black Pride

1790
01:17:44.082 --> 01:17:44.982
UK

1791
01:17:45.006 --> 01:17:45.806
Black Pride.

1792
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.130
Ryan Lanji. Who is the
innovator and creator of

1793
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.150
East London's queer
Bollywood night called

1794
01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.950
Hungama.

1795
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.800
Performing for UK Black
Pride was an honor.

1796
01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.440
There's this weird moment
where like time didn't

1797
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.260
exist and like those
moments when you're a kid

1798
01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.660
with your parents and
you're partying at a

1799
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.970
wedding and you hear a
song and you hear a tune

1800
01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:34.720
and your soul feels it
I could feel it and

1801
01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.480
everyone in the audience
I just I just phenomenal.

1802
01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:42.460
And so about coming and
exploring. learning and

1803
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.170
being together with
everyone you didn't

1804
01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:45.130
realise was there.

1805
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:48.570
As a queer Muslim who's
living in Birmingham who

1806
01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:50.670
grew up in Birmingham
how did you find the

1807
01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:52.650
impact in relation to
seeing what was going on

1808
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.370
with the protests?

1809
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:56.180
I'm not from Birmingham?
Can you not tell I'm from

1810
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:56.870
Glasgow.

1811
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.420
I have this opportunity
this platform and yes

1812
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.570
this privilege to be able
to go to the community

1813
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.240
ask some questions and
challenge them and then

1814
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.490
leave again and not have
to deal unfortunately

1815
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:09.470
with what people that
actually live in the

1816
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.600
community like people in
the street what they

1817
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.460
have to deal with
because yes they are

1818
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.310
marginalised as Muslims
and they deal with

1819
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:19.520
racism. So I would say
moving forward I think

1820
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.940
we need to have love in
our hearts and really

1821
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.760
open up dialogue and be
able to trust each other

1822
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.780
more.

1823
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.980
I think the LGBTQ
community has a lot of

1824
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.010
work to do you know and
I think the more of us

1825
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:38.960
who read up on history
queer history

1826
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.310
specifically and the
liberation movements the

1827
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:44.870
more we begin to
understand that we're

1828
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.400
kind of we're still
fighting a lot of the

1829
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.740
same fights and a lot of
those fights are

1830
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.080
internal right we're
fighting with each other.

1831
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.430
We're protecting
ourselves from each

1832
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:55.220
other we're trying to
bridge the divide we're

1833
01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.140
trying to have these
conversations across

1834
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.760
party lines and
racial lines.

1835
01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:02.260
So this Pride here
is inclusive.

1836
01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.290
This Pride here caters
for our migrants

1837
01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:07.900
our refugees our
asylum seekers

1838
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:09.910
our Black and Brown
queer folk

1839
01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.910
our homeless. people who
are trying to get into

1840
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:13.930
the workforce.

1841
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.740
It is the most inclusive
Pride you will come across.

1842
01:20:20.143 --> 01:20:22.897
This is the place
where you can be

1843
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:26.821
100 per cent free.

1844
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.750
This is the place were
you are not too Black.

1845
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:34.604
You are not too White.

1846
01:20:35.451 --> 01:20:37.005
You are are not too Brown.

1847
01:20:37.105 --> 01:20:38.359
You are not too short.

1848
01:20:39.083 --> 01:20:40.583
You are not too tall.

1849
01:20:40.607 --> 01:20:42.607
You are not too fat.

1850
01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:44.631
You are not too maga.

1851
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.070
You are not too gay.

1852
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.260
You are not too straight.

1853
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:51.600
You are not too butch.

1854
01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.580
You are not too fem.

1855
01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.690
You are not too undecided.

1856
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.810
You are not too binary.

1857
01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:00.180
You are not anything

1858
01:21:00.204 --> 01:21:05.704
except too brainwashed to
realise how beautiful you are.

1859
01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.950
This is where you belong.

1860
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.420
Hi I'm Aaron from
Beyonce experience you're

1861
01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.550
watching Rainbow Films at
UK Black Pride.

1862
01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.140
I've been here since 6am
when it was raining and I

1863
01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.330
honestly thought wow are
people even gonna come

1864
01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.060
you know in the rain.
Every time I pop out my

1865
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.060
head it just seems to
like double in size with

1866
01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.610
the vibe and energy here.
I can feel it backstage

1867
01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:35.680
like I'm gonna have
absolute chills going on

1868
01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.990
that stage for
that audiene.

1869
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:56.620
I've never been so
excited for a performance

1870
01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.540
you know this
performance and what I'm

1871
01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.270
doing today has been in
my head for probably

1872
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:02.260
about four or five
months.

1873
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:07.550
I am so proud of Aaron
Carty like I don't think

1874
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:11.000
that people realise how
much work he puts into

1875
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.910
the Beyonce experience.
The handmaking of all of

1876
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:17.330
the costumes. the
rehearsals. the dancers

1877
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.620
everything.

1878
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.060
If you like it you should
have put a ring on it.

1879
01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:53.350
The Beyonce experience.

1880
01:22:54.374 --> 01:22:58.774
When we rise.

1881
01:22:58.798 --> 01:23:02.898
When we rise.

1882
01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.170
Like over 10.000 people.

1883
01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.830
You make this happen.

1884
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:17.840
So now you know what
as we walk off

1885
01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.690
we take Pride
in who we are.

1886
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.910
No to racism

1887
01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:24.530
no to sexism

1888
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.420
no to homophobia

1889
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.890
no to biphobia

1890
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:29.360
no to transphobia

1891
01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.670
no to any phobia at all.

1892
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:35.180
It's incredible that an
event like UK Black Pride

1893
01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.250
exists.

1894
01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.880
You know the community
has shown me such

1895
01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.760
remarkable compassion and
empathy and I think it's

1896
01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.710
just a demonstration of
the potential of our

1897
01:23:42.710 --> 01:23:45.320
community right? We do
have it within us to

1898
01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.210
recognise each other's
humanity to treat each

1899
01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:49.310
other with kindness but
I think that if we're

1900
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:50.720
going to get to where we
need to go we got to do

1901
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.440
it together.

1902
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.750
For weeks at the gates of
a primary school in

1903
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:57.450
Birminghamt here were
loud protests claiming

1904
01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:01.650
teachers were promoting
homosexuality. Now pupils

1905
01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:04.200
working hard inside
Anderton Park Primary

1906
01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.080
School aren't disturbed
by demonstrations

1907
01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.620
outside. Today the High
Court in Birmingham ruled

1908
01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.350
an injunction stopping
the demos at the school

1909
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:15.990
gates should be made
permanent.

1910
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.400
Well I'm just glad that
we were able to

1911
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.530
contribute to getting
these protesters banned

1912
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.280
once and for all.

1913
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:21.810
The police officer came
to you didn't they?

1914
01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:23.735
Yeah basically they
took a statement.

1915
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.270
They came down here
they're in the office for like

1916
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.630
three hours talking
about you know what

1917
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.550
they're trying to do with
the case they did say it

1918
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:31.560
was going to be quite
difficult to prove a lot

1919
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.010
of things.

1920
01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.770
However she said the
footage that I submitted

1921
01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.630
the things that I filmed
outside with you in there

1922
01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:37.080
as well.

1923
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:38.730
She said that was a
critical piece of

1924
01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:40.890
evidence that helped to
get them prosecuted and

1925
01:24:40.890 --> 01:24:42.920
without that piece of
evidence I don't think

1926
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.070
they would have had the
case. There are gonna be

1927
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:46.730
other groups are going
to be opposed to it but

1928
01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:48.640
this sends out a clear
message that hate speech

1929
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.320
is not going to be
tolerated. This is just

1930
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.490
the start. I think we've
got a lot more work to do.

1931
01:24:52.514 --> 01:24:54.514
Just thank you for
being a part of it.

1932
01:24:54.538 --> 01:24:56.538
Do you know what?
It's all about the Rainbow.

1933
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:15.600
So you feeling
prepped for tonight?

1934
01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.360
Yeah I actually am feeling
prepped. I got my mic

1935
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.860
ready so everything.

1936
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:23.590
I was struggling so much
when I came out and I

1937
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:26.530
never really saw anyone
like me and hopefully I

1938
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:28.740
can try and be that for
other people.

1939
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:32.260
You're really impacting
people now. And it's just

1940
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.890
nice to know that
your voice is a voice

1941
01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:37.410
that matters now.

1942
01:25:37.434 --> 01:25:39.434
No I'm like I'm an angry
Twitter ranter that's

1943
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.550
my identity.

1944
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.060
You're bifurious.

1945
01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.150
Bifurious always.

1946
01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.190
Oh wait
there we go.

1947
01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.450
Yeah that's fine.

1948
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:53.030
So as you can see this
exhibition is about

1949
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:57.110
equality. diversity and
what we can do to make

1950
01:25:57.530 --> 01:26:01.220
minority voices heard and
a bunch of us have been

1951
01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.710
working on a huge project
that's the involvement of

1952
01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:10.010
the LGBTQ community and
how we as Indians and how

1953
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.860
we as Brown people want
to be seen in the

1954
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.850
community because we
don't have a voice. So a

1955
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:18.560
lot of us has been have
been doing things through

1956
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.280
activism and I've been
working on music that is

1957
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:26.840
accepting who you are
despite of society and

1958
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.790
people telling you that
you aren't allowed to

1959
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.060
have both. You are
allowed to be queer and

1960
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.470
Brown and you're allowed
to be yourself.

1961
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.460
Hands together
falling on your knees.

1962
01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:42.610
You say he is good he is
grace he loves us

1963
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.350
equally.

1964
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:49.180
I'll hold her hand for
the whole world to see.

1965
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:53.950
We'll write our names on
locks and chain them to

1966
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:55.210
the city.

1967
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.210
You can waste your time.

1968
01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:03.100
You can try to shun me.
Leave me with no roof

1969
01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.080
over my head.

1970
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.840
I'll spend the night star
gazing with my lover instead.

1971
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:15.550
And I love the way
I was meant to.

1972
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:20.680
And I love the way
I was born to do.

1973
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:25.030
And I love the way
I would want to.

1974
01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.330
So free.

1975
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:36.140
That's such a
cute way to end it.

1976
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.100
Thank you.

1977
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:37.820
You smashed it.

1978
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.940
Before this I never
really thought of

1979
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:42.880
activism much. Now I've
made friends with so many

1980
01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.980
people who are doing so
many nice things for the

1981
01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:47.470
world and I want to be a
part of it. I want to

1982
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:49.960
continue on with seeing
where I can go with

1983
01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.260
fitting my queerness into
my music and how I

1984
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.330
can just create

1985
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.820
more of a visible space
for people like me.

1986
01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.410
I've started this when I
was in these spaces and

1987
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:03.830
they were all very White
and very gay. And through

1988
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:07.460
this. I've met so many
people of colour. I've

1989
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.400
met so many bisexual
people. We're having all

1990
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.290
of these discussions and
you can have these

1991
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.990
conversations so loudly
and openly. All I was

1992
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:16.730
doing was just being
myself and suddenly

1993
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.950
everyone's listening to
me and I feel like I

1994
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:19.760
just want to keep going.

1995
01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:23.980
I just think it's time
for minds to change. We

1996
01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.800
can't allow this
narrative of homophobia

1997
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.840
in the Muslim community
to go unchallenged

1998
01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.720
forever. I know that
queer Muslims like myself

1999
01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.270
me included definitely
will not allow homophobic

2000
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:36.850
Muslims to take over the
narrative anymore.

2001
01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:40.530
It's time to have a queer
platform like this. It's

2002
01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:43.860
time for us to unite and
it's time for us to make

2003
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.050
that difference.

2004
