97
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.446

98
00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.698

99
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.533
On these stages right here.

100
00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:30.747
And he would bring me here all the time.
and he would love taking me on "the tour."

101
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.336
The tour of The Comedy Store.
and he loved-- he would get so excited.

102
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.880
and he would beam and say "Come on. honey.
I'm gonna show you around.

103
00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.674
and I'm gonna show you behind the scenes
of all the crazy shit

104
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.176

all the years.

105

And all the places
that people did coke in the '80s."

106
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.309
And... that was-- there were a lot
of stops on the tour about that.

107
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:57.106
And then. he would just think
about how he loved being a part of this.

108
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.107
And he...

109
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:05.198

was belonging to this club. to this group.

110

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.564
and the winter may be harsh.

He's America's dad--

You know. Bob. uh. like Bill Cosby.
was from Philadelphia.

191
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:32.691
but Bob. um. put people
to sleep the old-fashioned way.

192
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.152
By doing his act.

193
00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.991
He would've loved the outpouring
of support

194
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.868
from all over the world
that he's gotten.

195
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:43.869
He would've loved it.

196
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:48.040
And let's face it. somebody had to knock
that cunt Betty White off the Internet.

197
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.128
Ninety-nine years old.

198
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.588
And I told her. I said "Betty--"

199
00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.006
I talked to her a month ago.

200
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.801
I said. "Do not go
to that Travis Scott concert."

201
00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:04.682
She said. "I have to go. I promised Travis
I'd be in the front row."

202
00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:08.936
Ninety-nine problems
and a breath ain't one.

203
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.609
But Bob wasn't something
that was taken away from us.

204
00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:18.696
He was something
that was given to us.

205
00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:26.203
And one day...

206
00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.207
when the laughs
had hit a certain amount...

207
00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.961
he just unzipped his human suit.

208
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.547
and he went for a ride.

209
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.092
And he's floating around right now.

210
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:46.307
Probably right through this room
at this very moment. flanked by angels.

211
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.895
And they're saying "You made people laugh.

212
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.772
You made people feel loved.

213
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.858

214
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:06.577
You created a cathedral of fucking love
in this world.

215
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.580
And that was your life. Bob Saget.

216
00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:13.751
A cathedral of love.
a cathedral of laughter.

220
00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:35.314
He told everybody he loved them.
Everybody in here probably--

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.942
Let's pump some gratitude into this room
for Bob Saget.

222
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.985
Everybody in here probably thinks
Bob was their best friend.

223
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.320
and he probably was.

224
00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:43.864
Every one of them thinks
he was their best friend.

225
00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.033
But I know it was me.

226
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.539
He loved people.
he loved comedy. he loved--

227
00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:52.706
-Cocaine.
-...music.

228
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.875
At a point. at a point.

229
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.795
In his honor.
I'm gonna suck dick for coke tonight.

230
00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:00.381
Funny.

231
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:02.883
But he loved playing that guitar.

232
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.428
and... I know
because I found it backstage one night

233
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.805
and there was a big hole
in the back.

234
00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:13.978
-He fucked his guitar?
-He fucked that thing.

235
00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.355
He fucked the shit outta that thing.

236
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.984
He played a 'D'
and it took him there.

237
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.319
It took him there.

238
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.279
Give us a "D".

239
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.699
I know Mike's a B.B. King "D".

240
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.995
Who do you think got more pussy.
Stamos or Mayer?

241
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:33.247
That guitar's not gender-neutral. man.

242
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.794
If Mayer and fucking Stamos
have a "pussy-off."

243
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.880
I don't know
if you remember this. Chris.

244
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.715
-What?
-But I came to see you--

245
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.676
I came to the Comedy Cellar up
in New York and you were onstage

246
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.511
and you spotted me
when I sat down.

247
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.804
You went "Is that Mayer?"

248
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.641
And then you said. "I was just having
a conversation with a friend about you."

249
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.143
-Remember you said this?
-I might've...

250
00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.395
Do you remember everything
that you say?

251
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.148
"I was just having a conversation
with a friend about you.

252
00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.650
I said that you wrote 'cliterature'."

253
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.447
I did say that.

254
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:13.162

256
00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.545

he was for a second?

257
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.546
Tell us.

258
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.340
Oh. all right.

259
00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.341
One time I was going through a brea--

260
00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.009
You can keep playing.
It sounds so good.

261
00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.344
It sounds so good.

262
00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:32.222
This is a male-to-male love song.

263
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.560
I was going through a breakup.
as people do.

264
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.855
And I was so heartbroken.

265
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.357
I called Bob.

266
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.943
Bob would check on me
every couple of hours.

267
00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:48.572
And he came by my house
and he picked me up at two in the morning

268
00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.909
and he took me
to Astro Burger to get a pastrami--

269
00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:54.662
a lot of my Bob stories are about meat.

270
00:15:56.413 --> 00:16:01.210
He loved an emergency pastrami sandwich.
but in this case. I was really hurting

271
00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:05.130
and he came by. and he picked me up.
and he took me to Astro Burger all night.

272
00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:09.760
And I sat in his car. and I was crying.
eating my pastrami sandwich.

273
00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:13.931
-Oh. God!
-Bob gave me this unbelievable pep talk.

274
00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.934
-That's a website.
-You were crying. Think about the woman.

275
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:22.898
"I blew Jeff Ross!"

276
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.985
"Why did I blow Jeff Ross?

277
00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.362
The fuck was I thinking?"

278
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.491
You think it's easy for me?

279
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:36.328
Looking like Vin Diesel
if he were neither fast nor furious?

280
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.914
You think it's easy for me?

281
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.541
No. it's not easy for you. man.

282
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:42.584
That's why you're so funny. man.

283
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:45.587
-And Bob-- And Bob--
-You have no choice.

284
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.924
Bob gave me a pep talk that lasted longer

285
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.969
than that entire relationship
that I was upset about.

286
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:57.224
And he drove me to his house
and I stayed in Aubrey's room--

287
00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.559
Aubrey was--

288
00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.270
I stayed in the guest room. and--
for like three days.

289
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.397
and he was there for people.

290
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.736
Even though he had every chance to become
some Hollywood phony. he never did it.

291
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:13.115
He had every chance to be bitter.
He had so much loss in his life.

292
00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.701
Bob never did it.
He worked through positivity.

293
00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.119
He always said. "I don't do negative."

294
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.246
He would block people.

295
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.374
His tour was called
"I Don't Do Negative".

296
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.126
and I have a theory

297
00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:28.630
that him and Norm Macdonald
were murdered by Artie Lang.

298
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:39.183
He taught me that if I got real hungry
I could eat urinal mints.

299
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.644
'cause they're packed with nutrients.

300
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.605
I feel less safe in the world
without Bob.

301
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:46.440
I feel one layer of protection.

302
00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:49.068
I feel older without Bob.

303
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.362
Like. Bob was a defense shield.

304
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.239
He knew who to call.

305
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.784
what doctor to call
if you had a health issue.

306
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.787
He knew what lawyer
to call if you had a problem.

307
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.665
He knew--
he just knew how to do stuff.

308
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:07.294
And he was "Bobby Daddy"
to so many people. and...

309
00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:09.296
-That's right.
-Casting's a bitch. man.

310
00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:13.634
And I hope everybody here
either had Bob as a friend like that.

311
00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:15.677
or someday has a friend like that.

312
00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:16.762

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.547
Thank you all for being here tonight.

322
00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.551
And I just gotta say.
Bob has the best friends in the world.

323
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:59.012
This guy here.
has been such a good friend to Bob.

324
00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:07.020
And John Mayer.
You're a beautiful guy.

325
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.649
I have really gotten to know you.
and I want to have your babies.

326
00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:15.362
And no. really. Bob--
Bob...

327
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:18.240
Everything you're hearing
about Bob is real.

328
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.867
I knew him when he was 19 years old.

329
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.202
and everybody is saying
"Oh. God I didn't--

330
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:26.123
I'm so surprised how loved he was
and how big he was!

331
00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:27.624
He would've been so surprised."

332
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:30.335
And I will tell you
Bob would not have been surprised.

333
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.254
Bob figured he was this big.

334
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.091
This is how big Bob thought he was.

335
00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.178
He actually told me once.
that when he was gonna die.

336
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.638
he was gonna donate his penis
to science.

337
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.100
And he was dead serious.

338
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:48.520
And actually. last week.
Kelly got a letter...

339
00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:53.025
and it said.
"Dear Mrs. Saget.

340
00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:57.654
We think we can do better."
Signed. "Science."

341
00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:05.370
I just love his friends.
I love his family.

342
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:09.082
I knew his family so well.
and his daughters are beautiful.

343
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.960
Just beautiful people.
and. uh. I wanna say...

344
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.755
on behalf of the comedians.
you know.

345
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:18.926
we're here tonight
supporting scleroderma.

346
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:22.930
and we're supporting the Saget family
and the Saget girls.

347
00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.391
And we're supporting them all.
and we wanna love them.

348
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.561
love the Scleroderma Foundation.

349
00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:31.355
Love Kelly.

350
00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:36.443
In fact. about 11 of us made love to Kelly
in the Saget hot tub this afternoon.

351
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:44.284
And we're selling that as an NFT
for $700.000

352
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:48.664
if any of you have money
and wanna go to hell with us.

353
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.709
That NFT's gonna
be a hot one.

354
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.796
[Ross] You know. when<i> I </i>think
it's too soon. that's fucked up.

355
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.383
Really. is that too soon?

356
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.343
We have a great show.

357
00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.761
and I wanted to say one more thing

358
00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:06.348
about someone who's here tonight
who's an incredible friend of mine

359
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.892
and loved Bob so much.

360
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.645
Jackson Browne is a special guy.

361
00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:14.898
You know. he doesn't--
he had a bad back

362
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.026
and he called me two days ago
and said "Mike. I can't do this."

363
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:22.030
This is a terrible introduction
for Jackson.

364
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.448
He would not like this.

365
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.119
He's a rock star!

366
00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:32.207
"Talked to him yesterday and he told me
his prostate was killing him..."

367
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.626
-All right.
-"...Like a balloon."

368
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.712
"If I could get someone
to stick their fingers up my ass--"

369
00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.338
-Jackson called--
-"Don't know what the fuck is going on.

370
00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:44.511
I'll be down there. but. otherwise.
this thing is raw. and fucking throbbing.

371
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.055
I have a throbbing orb in my anus.

372
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.726
And as long as it keeps time.
I'll be great!"

373
00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.982
-Ahh!
-All right. take two.

374
00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:59.693
So Jackson's such a great guy and he...

375
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.946
he called me the other day.

376
00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:08.702
He said "Mike. Mike. I really wanna come.

377
00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:12.080
but I was up all night
fucking quadruplets.

378
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.876
'Cause I'm a rock star."

379
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:20.756
And then today he said
"No. the hell with them!

380
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.675
I'm here for Bob Saget!"

381
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.385
Jackson Browne.

382
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.220
[cheers. applause]

383
00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:28.930
Ugh.

384
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:30.974
Ow!

385
00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:39.274
See. this is--
this is not the intro I wanted.

386
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.236
Oh good. they're leaving.
Oh. good.

387
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.032
Would you like us
to clear out of here now?

388
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.867
-We're gonna be very distracting.
-You can stay.

389
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.369
-Unless you wanna clear out.
-No. I'd love to stay here.

390
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:55.749
-Um...
-If you sing directly to me. I'll stay.

391
00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.587
Gotta turn the guitar on though. right?

392
00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:03.381
-[notes on electric guitar]
There it is. yeah.

393
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.800
No. yeah.

394
00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:09.846
Bob asked me to do a show in New York

395
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.016
with Jeff and a bunch
of other really great comedians.

396
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.227
Funny people.
Really funny people.

397
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:19.940
And he wanted me to sing this song
that I'm gonna sing for you now.

398
00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:22.234
but it's like--
I said. "Are you sure?"

399
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:26.446
I was trying to think of something
that would go with the. you know.

400
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.491
He said "No. no. no.
Just sing that."

401
00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.660
What it is. is I felt like.
after like an hour--

402
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:35.622
after laughing really hard. it's good
to contemplate death for a little while.

403
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:40.210
You can-- you can. uh.
and presumably go back to laughing.

404
00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:44.548
But I mean. I finished the night
with this. He said it was perfect.

405
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:53.515

Wow.

444
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:22.909
Thank you. Jackson.

445
00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:26.121
Good luck with whatever
your back issue was.

446
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.958
That was so beautiful.
God.

447
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.669
One of the legends of all time.
ladies and gentlemen.

448
00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:34.254
Jackson Browne.

449
00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:35.338
-While-- while--
-What are we gonna do now?

450
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:41.177
While they're all back there.
my buddy Seth Green is here.

451
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:42.846
He was a good friend of Bob's.

452
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:44.889
What do you think. Seth?

453
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.600
Do you wanna come say something?
Are you ready?

454
00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:48.685
[Seth Green] Yeah.

455
00:28:48.768 --> 00:28:49.936
That was a perfect intro.

456
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:56.067
This guy has a perfect back. everybody.
Perfect picture of health.

457
00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:57.777
What can I say?

458
00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.946
He's a<i> mensch.</i>
He's a great guy.

459
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:02.699
He's an actor.
He owns an animation studio.

460
00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:04.075
He's on a bunch of shows.

461
00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.493
[Carey] He's a man that
every man would love to be.

462
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.454
-[Ross] He's one of the people that Bob...
-I'll take this.

463
00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:09.622
-...Bob loved dearly.
-I wanna come hug you.

464
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.375
I feel like it's been ten or twelve years
since we've seen each other.

465
00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:13.752
Hug me. I'm very fluffy.

466
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:15.754
Aw.

467
00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:17.380
Aw.

468
00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:18.506
[Ross] That's a beautiful moment.

469
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.508
[Green] I'm getting some ASMR.

470
00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.177
-like I'm getting...
-Ah...

471
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:26.639
Uh-oh. uh-oh. uh-oh.

472
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:30.685
Probably-- it was the Icy-Hot
I put on my neck.

473
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.313
I just thought it'd be funny. I knew
I was gonna be hugging people.

474
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.984
Welcome to
the Bob Super-Spreader. everybody.

475
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:45.492
-We're coming to see ya. Bob.
-That was--

476
00:29:45.575 --> 00:29:46.910
We're coming to see ya.

477
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.870
That's all he wanted.

478
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:56.127
Bob would be so thrilled
to spread an infection

479
00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:58.755
that populated heaven.

480
00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:00.840
Truly. truly.

481
00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:02.801
There's so much room there.

482
00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.221
Jesus Christ. that Jackson Browne
like. really choked me up.

483
00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.807
-I wasn't prepared for that at all.
-That's what he does.

484
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.101
He loves to walk into a room
and fuck everybody up.

485
00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.730
"Oh. you guys are in a great mood.

486
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.149
What if you were
all uncontrollably crying?"

487
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.364
"I saw a bunch of people smile.

488
00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:26.366
You wanna feel something real heavy?"

489
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.453
[Carey] "I'm gonna bring
a little sincerity to this party."

490
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.081
All right. I'll say something.

491
00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:35.416
-I know you know Bob a long time.
-That's true.

492
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.294
You were good friends.
so I thought maybe

493
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.088
you would have something
to share tonight.

494
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:42.882
-So sweet of you to tee me up.
-I don't wanna put you on the spot...

495
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:47.011
It was when Robin Williams died.
and we-- everybody met here.

496
00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:49.222
'cause like.
what the fuck do you do?

497
00:30:49.305 --> 00:30:50.932
We were all like. "Oh. shit.
Robin's dead.

498
00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:54.978
I guess we gotta get together
and figure out how to work that out."

499
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.897
And everybody needed to get up.

500
00:30:57.981 --> 00:31:01.025
Everybody needed
to mourn it onstage.

501
00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:04.654
I'll never forget because we were sitting
in one of those back chairs.

502
00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:07.323
and we all walked in.
I saw Bob.

503
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:09.284
And everybody just looked lost.

504
00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.703
And I looked at him and I was like
"Oh. we know each other.

505
00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:13.955
We've known each other a long time."
So we hugged.

506
00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:19.419
Hugged real big and I guess we gotta...
fucking deal with this now.

507
00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:22.672
But in that whole experience.

508
00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:27.635
it felt like
everyone was all the more committed

509
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.762
to not wasting a second.

510
00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:34.350
And not having an opportunity where you
saw someone that you loved. and you say

511
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:35.310
"I love you.

512
00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:38.646
And you've meant something."

513
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.981
You know what I mean?

514
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:43.818
Like. Bob fucking Saget. guys.

515
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.988
That motherfucker meant something.

516
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:54.913
And we were all lucky enough
to get a mainline dose of it.

517
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:56.539
In one way or another.

518
00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.668
[cheers. applause]

519
00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:05.506
That's the biggest thing. right. Jeff?

520
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.549
Let's just spread it.

521
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:09.135
That's what we get to do now.
We get to spread that love.

522
00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:10.261
The proof of that.

523
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.680
The proof of life that man lived.

524
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:17.977
He lived so big
and affected so many people.

525
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.104
and now we get to share it.

526
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:22.273
I do wanna mention his influence.

527
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:26.277
My buddy's a professor at Yale and NYU.

528
00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:30.406
He teaches broadcasting
and TV history and film history.

529
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.908
and he called me about Bob

530
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:35.495
and he said one of the things that comes
up a lot in his students' papers

531
00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:40.166
is Bob's character
and<i> Full House's </i>influence on kids

532
00:32:40.249 --> 00:32:45.797
who grew up in non-...
in unconventional households.

533
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.633
It made them feel normal.
and it made them feel like it was okay.

534
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:51.844
and one kid was an orphan
who wound up in a--

535
00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:53.972
You must hear this
all the time. man.

536
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:56.015
Well. we did it 35 years ago
or whatever.

537
00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:00.311
We were. it was odd. there was three men
raising kids in San Francisco.

538
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.941
But now
it's the new normal. you know.

539
00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:08.695
And every year it's becoming more divorce.
more single-sexed parents.

540
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.114
so it's kind
of a timed-release thing. right?

541
00:33:11.197 --> 00:33:13.032
What's "sexed parents"?
What?

542
00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:14.367
Same sex.

543
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.410
Same sex parents.

544
00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.412
Oh. same-sex parents. I thought you said--

545
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:18.454
Yeah. things change.

546
00:33:18.538 --> 00:33:21.040
Like the second time we did
<i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>

547
00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:23.459
the world had gotten so fucking stupid.

548
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:29.507
It didn't seem that dumb anymore.
by comparison.

549
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.427
[Green] It was more just like
<i>Normal and More Normal.</i>

550
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.178
[Carey] It was<i> Norm and Normal.</i>

551
00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:35.763
<i>Basic and More Basic-er.</i>

552
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:39.350
Mike Young is here.

553
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.352
Mike Young and Paul Rodriguez
are still here.

554
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:42.603
Come on out.

555
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.063
Mike-- Mike Young.

556
00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:47.567
Mike Young opened for Bob the last--
come on out.

557
00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:53.281
The very funny Mr. Mike Young.

558
00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:57.660
Nine hundred million dollars' worth
of talent. and an $11 microphone.

559
00:33:57.744 --> 00:33:58.828
Stand up. come on tell--

560
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:03.916
Thirteen years with Bob. yeah.

561
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:09.797
We met years ago
when Bob did<i> Entourage</i>.

562
00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:12.717
A mutual friend was like.
"You and Bob should go on the road."

563
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.178
We met. Bob's like.
"Come do a few dates."

564
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.888
Next thing you know. 13 years later.

565
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:20.475
it was just me and Bob.
just doing a two-man show in every city.

566
00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:26.314
And so. I was blessed to get that
opportunity and I didn't take it--

567
00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:28.816
[clears throat] Excuse me.
I didn't take it lightly.

568
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.403
And Bob was one of those guys
who just lived for this.

569
00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.321
He lived for this.

570
00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:36.866
Like. whatever was happening in Bob's
life-- and a lot was happening.

571
00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.368
This was his moment
that he just loved.

572
00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:42.663
And after he got off-- he could be
complaining about all his life shit

573
00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.916
in the daytime. but he did. we know.

574
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:46.501
Neurotic as fuck.

575
00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.837
Neurotic to the hilt.

576
00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.090
But this was what Bob loved.

577
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:55.426
'Cause every single time he would be
nervous about selling tickets.

578
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.011
yet we'd sell out everywhere.

579
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.680
He's wake up at five o'clock
in the morning. he would do press.

580
00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.140
He didn't have to do press.

581
00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:03.726
In his mind. "We've gotta move
80 more tickets."

582
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.604
He's doing the morning news.
he's doing every show...

583
00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:10.650
It's like "Yo. you're fuckin' Bob Saget.
bro. Chill out! Chill out!

584
00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:13.778
I'll go on the stupid show and fucking
sell a ticket." You know what I mean?

585
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:16.447
"You're good. we're good."
And we were good.

586
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:19.158
And he sold out every damn place
we were at.

587
00:35:19.242 --> 00:35:23.287
And it was nuts that he. in his mind.
was still like this kid from Philly

588
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:27.667
who wasn't like sorta good enough.
or kinda still had to hustle.

589
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.504
But he just wasn't seeing sometimes
what everybody else was seeing.

590
00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:35.800
until he got up here. saw a full crowd
and rocked the show

591
00:35:35.883 --> 00:35:38.261
and got off and was fucking on fire.

592
00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:41.013
"You see that shit?
I fuckin' killed that shit!"

593
00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:43.891
I was like. "Yeah. bro. why'd you
drive me crazy for three days

594
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.810
thinking you're not gonna
sell tickets?"

595
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:47.353
He was neurotic.

596
00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:51.190
But I was just like. "Yo. Bob.
that's just what you deserve.

597
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:54.610
Love and respect.
'cause that's what poured out of you.

598
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:58.656
So. that's all I wanted to say.
I'll miss him.

599
00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:00.616
God bless you guys.
Thank you.

600
00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:04.078
[cheers. applause]

601
00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:10.585
[Ross] Mike Young.

602
00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.753
You got a video?
You were playing a video?

603
00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:13.838
All right.

604
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:17.341
We have a very special message
from Michael Keaton.

605
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:19.969
Am I in the way?

606
00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:23.806
Hey. happy birthday. Bobby.

607
00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:28.394
You know. the kooky thing
about getting older.

608
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:34.984
I'm trying to-- Oh. oh. sorry.

609
00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:35.943
What is it?

610
00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.987
Oh. it's a problem with the-- I got it.

611
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.113
It's a roast.

612
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.781
Okay. you-- dirty. right?

613
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.782
Okay.

614
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:45.953
All right. I got an idea.

615
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.496
Let's go.

616
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:49.373
Hey.

617
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:53.002
Hey Bob. I was in the men's room
the other day...

618
00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:56.672
What?

619
00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:58.174
I'm sorry. what?

620
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.678
No. seriously. what's this for?

621
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.809
Get the fuck outta here.

622
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.479
He did?

623
00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:14.440
When?

624
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.738
I was supposed to do this podcast.
by the way.

625
00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:28.287
Okay... let me think.

626
00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:30.206
What do I...

627
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.669
Okay. hold on. let me. uh...

628
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.383
Let me see if I can work up
some fake tears here.

629
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.058
Nothing.

630
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.602
Uh...

631
00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.900
What do you mean.
just "Why don't I say how I feel?"

632
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:00.778
Who does that?

633
00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:04.740
Okay. let me...

634
00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:07.201
I guess I could say something like...

635
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.580
You know. every time...

636
00:38:12.164 --> 00:38:15.042
and I mean like<i> every </i>time...

637
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.296
you would run into this guy.

638
00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:22.049
if you weren't laughing...

639
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:28.889
Just looking. just looking into that face.
you couldn't help but smile.

640
00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.017
That's the truth.

641
00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:36.314
This is a tough one.

642
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:38.441
If there's any good news
to come out of this.

643
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.945
when we lose someone
like Bob or others.

644
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:48.492
we'll always have him
on record somewhere

645
00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:52.371
where we can click on the television

646
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:57.293
and watch him
and laugh and smile.

647
00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:01.839
And if there's anyone I think
who would really appreciate that.

648
00:39:01.922 --> 00:39:05.259
love that.
I think it would be Bob.

649
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.970
He was a really. really good dude.

650
00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.556
'Kay.

651
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:12.475

go to the bathroom.

go to the bathroom.

[Stamos] Boy. that's a tough one to watch.

689
00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.647
Here's something else
we wanna show you.

690
00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:27.485
Here's some snippets
from the night that we had his memorial

691
00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:29.028
at Jeff Franklin's house.

692
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:31.989
And so we thank you
for the gift of his life.

693
00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:36.243
we thank you and honor you
and bring you glory.

694
00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:41.540
because you let us know his love
and we got to love him back.

and pray in your holy name. amen.

697
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.388
That's what happens
when you grow up with Bob Saget.

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:58.015
You go one way or the other.

699
00:42:01.393 --> 00:42:03.437
We're all here because Bob...

700
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:06.774
loved us.

701
00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.151
He loved everyone here.

702
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:12.613
That's why we're here.
because he loved you.

And...

704
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:20.746

705
00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.290
I... I'm...

706
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.878
gonna take a long time
in my life to process this.

707
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:32.341
but you know what?
Every time that I feel sad.

708
00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:36.971
I am so lucky.
and we're all so lucky that

709
00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:43.852
we get to fill that well up
with thousands of laughs

710
00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:47.314
and beautiful stories and love.

711
00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:51.026
And I don't feel like this is an ending.

712
00:42:51.777 --> 00:42:57.241
I feel like this is the beginning
of a celebration of that guy.

713
00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:02.997
who was my brother.
and I love him so much.

714
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.959
And I don't know what I'm gonna do now
without him.

715
00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:11.255
And I think we all feel that way.

716
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:19.388
But man. this is a lot of love.

717
00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:22.766
And this is really beautiful.

718
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.811
and Bob would've loved this.

719
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.230
So. thank you.

720
00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:33.277
Man. Bob is...

721
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:40.784
He's probably the single
kindest person I've ever met.

722
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.787
He was very nice to me.

723
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:48.250
I would forget all kinds of things
that I used to think about all the time.

724
00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:49.918
and he'd
make me forget about them.

[chuckling]

727
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.025
And I used to watch him on television.
when I was growing up.

728
00:44:13.108 --> 00:44:14.443
when I was starting
my career.

729
00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:15.778
I would never dream...

730
00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:20.324
I would never dream
of a day like today.

731
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.035
That's why. Bob.

732
00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:25.579
That's why you get
a roomful of people.

733
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.164
Hello. John Mayer.

734
00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:30.459
Remember the time I tried to put 'shrooms
in your cappuccino machine

735
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.211
and Bob was
laughing at me?

736
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.799
Your parties will never be
that good again.

737
00:44:37.966 --> 00:44:40.636
And I would've never done that
if I didn't see Bob Saget and said.

738
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:43.055
"I'm gonna impress this motherfucker.
I'm gonna do some 'shrooms."

739
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:51.939
I gotta tell you. I take solace
in being in this room

740
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:55.859
and seeing who loved him
and seeing how he made you feel.

741
00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:59.905
You don't feel that special. hearing
someone has the same story as you.

742
00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:03.242
You feel like your hunch
about someone was correct.

743
00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:07.287
In this town full of cynics.
I saw a good one.

744
00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.623
Tim Allen. Come up.

745
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:17.339
Oh great. I gotta follow
fucking Chappelle.

746
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:19.007
This is fucked up.

747
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.385
Jesus.

748
00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:25.305
I thought I was Bob's only friend.

749
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.515
I show up here and I thought...

750
00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:29.810
I drove up here.. I said. "Shit.
he told me I was his only friend."

751
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:34.565
My heart goes out to the family.
everybody involved and I'm just--

752
00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:38.861
I'm overwhelmed. it's been a hard--
it's been a fuckin' weird couple of days.

753
00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:42.114
I was in Orlando the night before.
same club.

754
00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:45.701
and I was in Jacksonville that night
when they called. and it was--

755
00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:47.619
it was messed up. man.

756
00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:50.456
I'll tell you what was really messed up
is the comic in me.

757
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.749
Right away I said...

758
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:57.921
He died at the Four Seasons.
which is across Orlando from the Hyatt.

759
00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:04.011
I kept asking-- that was terrible. but--
"What room was he in in the Four Seasons?

760
00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.554
In the suites up top?

761
00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:09.975
Why was I in the fucking Hyatt
across the street?"

762
00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:11.727
I'm just terrified of this.

763
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.730
The only way
I can handle loss is by jokes.

764
00:46:14.813 --> 00:46:17.483
My old man died suddenly.
and this took the wind out of me.

765
00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:18.901
This really took the wind out of me.

766
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:22.613
That said. I'm just blessed
to be asked to be doing this.

767
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:24.114
It was very difficult.

768
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.824
I'm not good at this stuff.

769
00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:29.286
I said. I drove up here going
"This fucker has a lot of friends."

770
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.455
I thought I was special."

771
00:46:31.538 --> 00:46:32.748
You're all special people.

772
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:34.625
This was a very special individual.

773
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:37.002
And the wind is out of my sails.

774
00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:41.131
it's just this gap that takes a while
to grasp and sit there and think about.

775
00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:43.175
Bless all of you people
and these prayers you had for him

776
00:46:43.258 --> 00:46:45.552
and these wonderful friends
of his and thank you all for at least

777
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.970
accepting me into this group.

778
00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:48.305
Goodnight. Bob.

779
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.645
One of my favorite comedians.
and a good friend of Bob's.

780
00:46:54.728 --> 00:46:56.313
Paul Rodriguez is here.

781
00:46:56.855 --> 00:46:58.065

Welcome. buddy.

783
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:14.873
I don't know if I can get through this.

784
00:47:17.209 --> 00:47:18.293
I met Bob...

785
00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:20.420
[audience member]
We love you.

786
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:23.173
...many years ago at a gangbang.

787
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:32.558
It was not just a gangbang.

788
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:34.518
It was a dungeon too...

789
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.605
He was there
with his first wife Manuel.

792
00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:50.909
Later. we were both fucking
the same waitress here...

793
00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:57.207
and then Mitzi found out about it.

794
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.626
She called him into her office.
wanted to know

795
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.838
what waitress was
spreading diseases around here.

796
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:10.178
Bob stuck up for me.
he said we only had-- [sobs]

797
00:48:12.264 --> 00:48:13.765
I don't know if I can go on.

798
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:16.476
Okay. thank you.

799
00:48:17.144 --> 00:48:17.978
He said...

800
00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:21.857
Bob stuck up for me
and he said we only--

801
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.400
we only had gonorrhea.

802
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.155
We didn't have herpes.
That was probably Louie Anderson.

803
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.659
[sobbing]

804
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.497
He would have wanted disrespect
like that.

805
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.335
What can I tell you?

806
00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:43.295
He's missed. you know?

807
00:48:43.378 --> 00:48:46.423
I first found out Bob had died.
I was in Alaska.

808
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:49.968
And then the next week Louie Anderson.

809
00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:52.012
Naturally. like everyone up here.
you start going.

810
00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:53.889
"Wow. don't they go in threes?"

811
00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:58.518
And then someone said. "Betty White died."
And we said "Ah. thank God. shit."

812
00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.109
[sighs]

813
00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:07.778
You know...

814
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.493
It is true. Every time you saw Bob.
he made you feel good. you know?

815
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.831
Every one of us up here swears
that we were his best friend.

816
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:22.918
I think that's the mark of a-- of a liar.

817
00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.174
No!

818
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:36.098
I'm glad for his children.

819
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:40.811
I can't imagine the pain you must feel.
but just know that all of us.

820
00:49:40.894 --> 00:49:45.107
we loved your father so much.
He was a great guy.

821
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.650
I just wanna say thank you. good night.

822
00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:47.693
Yeah.

823
00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.196
Paul Rodriguez.

824
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:53.448
[Stamos] Hey. Jeff.

825
00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:58.662
I wanna read my last text from Bob.
It said "I love you so much.

826
00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:01.206
I will say that God gave me
the brother that I wanted.

827
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:02.499
and I love you for it."

828
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:08.547
I said. "Well. you have a lot of God-given
brothers. but I'm first. right?"

829
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.425
And he said. "Yes you are.
because Brad Grey died."

830
00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.802
Okay. well. He says "I've known him since
I was 22 years old.

831
00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:17.472
but you're number one."
I said something about John Mayer.

832
00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:20.892
and he said--
Mayer's not listening. is he?

833
00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:23.812
He said "Mayer's an amazing friend.
but he's more fair-weather.

834
00:50:23.895 --> 00:50:26.022
You're always there.
so you're number one."

835
00:50:32.904 --> 00:50:36.032
Ladies and gentlemen.
Bob's second-best friend. John Mayer.

836
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.416
Yeah.

837
00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:45.709
Hi everyone. hi .

838
00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:48.962
Um...

839
00:50:49.504 --> 00:50:53.341
I've been lucky enough to have
the opportunity to speak so much

840
00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:55.218
about how I feel about Bob that...

841
00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.888
I'm lucky that I've said...

842
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:03.226
the main. major thoughts
that I've had.

843
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.438
but the thoughts keep coming.
and the observations keep coming.

844
00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:07.522
and the journey keeps going.

845
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:11.026
and you get better. and you get worse.
And you get better. and you get worse.

846
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:15.697
I just wanna say that we all know
how much Bob loved us.

847
00:51:16.948 --> 00:51:22.788
But I would like to bring up another
thing that he did without us knowing it.

848
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:25.665
was that he accepted us.

849
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:30.378
And acceptance is the boring part of love.
but it's just as important.

850
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:31.797
When you're accepted.

851
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:36.384
Weird people don't think
other weird people are weird.

852
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.514
We all know who we were in high school.
We're running from it.

853
00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:43.141
That's the great part of meeting
people for the first time.

854
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:44.810
They don't know that shit.

855
00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.104
You're a clean slate with someone.

856
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.983
And with Bob.
I was a clean slate with him.

857
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:54.653
And I got to have my own unique
relationship with him.

858
00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:58.406
And I think he had a unique relationship
with me because I wasn't a comic.

859
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:02.619
And I didn't speak the language
of shirt insults.

860
00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:06.373
or make fun of someone 'cause
they stuttered on one word.

861
00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:09.125
Sometimes you stutter--
a comic will get ya.

862
00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:16.341
Bob liked me because
I was already kind of a poet.

863
00:52:16.424 --> 00:52:18.218
and he could say whatever he wanted

864
00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:20.470
because I wasn't gonna go
"All right. that's weird."

865
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:24.808
because all I do is speak in metaphors
no one's heard before.

866
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:26.184
-It's useless.
-True.

867
00:52:26.268 --> 00:52:28.478
I don't understand
a fucking word he says.

868
00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:32.607
I speak in useless metaphor
that only makes sense to me.

869
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:35.443
but Bob would do that in ways
that only made sense to him.

870
00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:38.363
and for some reason it was just like
"Yeah. you're with me."

871
00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:43.535
And the unlikeliness of our relationship
spoke to the truth of it

872
00:52:43.618 --> 00:52:47.414
and the realness of it.
because why fucking would you otherwise?

873
00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.832
Why would I...

874
00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:54.379
otherwise hang out with Bob Saget
if I didn't love everything about him

875
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:57.340
on a physical and metaphysical level.

876
00:52:57.424 --> 00:52:58.967
The other night I had a dream.

877
00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:01.803
I woke up crying because I saw Bob.

878
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.764
Aw. man...

879
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.601
It was young Bob.

880
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.353
And we were about to go
into a restaurant.

881
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:12.188
And I knew and he didn't know.

882
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:17.068
I looked at him and said.
"You gotta know how much I love you."

883
00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:19.613
He went "Yeah. I know. Fine."

884
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:23.992
"No. I'm telling you.
You gotta know how much I love you."

885
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:25.785
"Yeah. I know."

886
00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.246
And then I woke up
and of course. cried like a baby.

887
00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:30.415
And then I remembered I had to go
back to sleep

888
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:32.167
because I had something
very important the next day.

889
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.627
and I said out loud.

890
00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:36.755
"I love you. Bob.
but I gotta go back to sleep."

891
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:41.051
And I heard him say "Go back
to sleep. go back to sleep.

892
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:42.886
You have to go back to sleep.

893
00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:44.763
You have to.
You've got stuff tomorrow.

894
00:53:44.846 --> 00:53:46.932
You gotta get back to sleep."
I went "Okay."

895
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.936
And that's no different than
the magic of when he was around.

896
00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:52.354
And I learned that.

897
00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:56.107
It is not a jump to go
from here to there.

898
00:53:56.191 --> 00:54:00.820
Because there's nothing different about
the way we access the people we love.

899
00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.614
when they're there.
than when they're here.

900
00:54:02.697 --> 00:54:07.077
And that is the magic of Bob Saget
that keeps carrying on for me.

901
00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:09.996
Beautiful.

902
00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.582
That's beautiful.

903
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:17.545
And I wanna thank both of you
for being such great friends

904
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:20.006
and such a support system
to Bob.

905
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.383
I wanna thank all of you
for coming tonight

906
00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:23.760
because this is very cathartic
for all of us

907
00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:25.261
and I'm sure a lot of you too.

908
00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:26.304
It was nice to do this.

909
00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:28.890
I would love it if you'd collect yourself
for a second.

910
00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:32.352
because what you said was
very beautiful and I'm a little<i> verklempt</i>.

911
00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:36.356
And then someone else wants to speak. and
maybe you'll do a song that Bob loved.

912
00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.607
-Do a song.
-I'll do a song.

913
00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:39.359
-Yeah.
-I'd love to do a song.

914
00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:40.568
That would be great.

915
00:54:40.652 --> 00:54:42.487
Byron. are you back there?

916
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:46.449
A good friend of Bob Saget's.
Our friend. Byron Allen is here.

917
00:54:49.035 --> 00:54:52.998
Oh my God. we're gonna keep this tight
because we've got another crowd out there.

918
00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:56.543
We have to get ready
for Louie Anderson's memorial.

919
00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:03.258
I met Bob I think in '78.

920
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:05.135
-What?
-1978.

921
00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:07.303
-You both started as teenagers. right?
-Yeah.

922
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:13.309
We both started as teenagers
and I met him in 1978. right here.

923
00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:16.271
-About 42 years ago.
-Wow.

924
00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:20.567
And he was so warm.

925
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.987
and so kind and funny

926
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:27.532
and bizarre at the same time.

927
00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:28.533
Always.

928
00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:32.328
And that "The Dog Licked My Balls"?

929
00:55:33.204 --> 00:55:36.082
and the cat-pussy. whatever that was.

930
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.834
That was the clean stuff.

931
00:55:39.627 --> 00:55:45.341
When you first met him. he said things
to you that had you go to therapy.

932
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:49.304
You could not un-ring that bell.

933
00:55:49.387 --> 00:55:54.017
As a matter of fact. after I met Bob.
I avoided him for about two years

934
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.101
after I met him.

935
00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:59.981
I said "No. he's not gonna be here long.
He's gonna get arrested.

936
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.693
They're gonna haul him off."

937
00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:10.450
The thing about him is
that I really genuinely loved him.

938
00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.035
He was such a good person.

939
00:56:12.118 --> 00:56:15.705
And when you know somebody like that
for three. four decades.

940
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:18.958
he was just a good guy.

941
00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.420
And you know. as comics.
we have an entire spectrum.

942
00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:25.340
It's from A to Z.

943
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:28.468
He's just such a good. warm person.

944
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:33.098
And he was one of those guys
where you never thought.

945
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:39.354
I need to say to him.
"I love you. I appreciate you."

946
00:56:39.437 --> 00:56:42.440
Because you always thought
he would be there.

947
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:47.695
I could never imagine someone that good.

948
00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:51.324
that special. that warm.
that loving. that funny.

949
00:56:51.866 --> 00:56:53.701
not being there.

950
00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:57.288
When it happened.
it just set me back.

951
00:56:58.123 --> 00:57:00.333
I said. "You know what?
Never again."

952
00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:03.503
I am not making that mistake again.

953
00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:07.173
From now on. I'm gonna let 'em know.
on the spot. Boom.

954
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.550
'Cause that's what happens.

955
00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:14.556
Like I said. I met Bob 42 years ago.
He was a beautiful human being.

956
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:19.269
I literally came here to give
my condolences to his beautiful family.

957
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:22.647
He loved you more than anything.

958
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:27.444
He was better than most at expressing it.

959
00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:31.030
And I just wanna say.
you know. listen.

960
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:34.200
I really appreciated him.

961
00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:37.454
He was a great man.

962
00:57:37.537 --> 00:57:39.706
Some are good. some are great.

963
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:40.915
He was great.

964
00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:44.210
And I watched him for 42 years.

965
00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:46.045
Truly great.

966
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:49.174
Thank you
for the gift of Bob Saget.

967
00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:53.928
Thank you.
Take care of yourselves.

968
00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:57.182
Love one another.
hug one another.

969
00:57:57.724 --> 00:58:02.061
Go that extra second and actually say
"Are you okay?" Thank you.

970
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.354
Thank you.

971
00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:08.151
-[Stamos] Byron. we love you.
Thank you. Byron. that was beautiful.

972
00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:10.153
Thank you. Byron.

973
00:58:11.571 --> 00:58:12.655
[Stamos] Oh. no.

974
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:14.616
-[Ross] Oh. fuck.
-[Carey] God.

975
00:58:15.116 --> 00:58:16.701
[Ross] Is this necessary?

976
00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:17.911
[Stamos] Do we need it?

977
00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:23.541
Hi. Jon Lovitz here.

978
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:26.294
As you can see.
I'm in Las Vegas.

979
00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:29.297
I'm sorry I can't be there.

980
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:34.093
I don't wanna really dwell on
this. but a friend of mine. a comic.

981
00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:38.264
passed away
and I ended up getting his dates.

982
00:58:40.642 --> 00:58:43.019
I didn't take them.
They were offered to me.

983
00:58:43.102 --> 00:58:44.896
I don't want to say who it was.

984
00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:47.774
I told his family.
"I'm sorry. I can't be there."

985
00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:51.611
And they said...
I go. "I have to work."

986
00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.029
They said. "That's BS."

987
00:58:53.112 --> 00:58:54.322
And I was like...

988
00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:57.367
they know.

989
00:58:57.992 --> 00:59:01.955
Anyway. Bob was a very good friend
of mine.

990
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.832
and the weekend of his funeral

991
00:59:04.916 --> 00:59:08.795
I was performing stand-up in Florida.

992
00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:10.004
and it crossed my mind

993
00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:12.048
"Maybe I should cancel."

994
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:15.677
But then. you know. I didn't.

995
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.388
I felt so guilty not being
at his funeral.

996
00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:19.722
and then I thought.

997
00:59:19.806 --> 00:59:23.059
"Well. it's not like he's coming to mine."

998
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:28.523
I used to-- I still kind of do.
make up songs about him

999
00:59:28.606 --> 00:59:31.109
'cause I love him so much.
A great friend.

1000
00:59:31.192 --> 00:59:32.944
So I went to his house
about ten years ago.

1001
00:59:33.027 --> 00:59:35.280
and I said. "Bob. I wrote some songs
about you.

1002
00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:36.781
Do you wanna hear it?"
He said "Okay."

1003
00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:38.449
I go "All right.
here's the first one."

1004
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:41.786
♪<i> Oh you wake up in the morning</i>
<i>And you brush your teeth </i>♪

1005
00:59:41.869 --> 00:59:44.122
♪<i> Bob Saget takes it up the butt </i>♪

1006
00:59:45.206 --> 00:59:47.125
He said. "I don't like that."

1007
00:59:47.208 --> 00:59:48.960
And I said. "Why not?"

1008
00:59:49.043 --> 00:59:51.004
So I said. "Fine.
I'll write another song."

1009
00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.298
So I wrote another song about him.
A beautiful song.

1010
00:59:53.381 --> 00:59:54.882
This is my tribute to Bob.

1011
00:59:56.342 --> 00:59:59.345
He was a gourmet chef.
always in his kitchen.

1012
00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:03.641
So I wrote a song called
"Bob Saget Likes It in His Kitchen".

1017
01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.200
Hey. it's Bob's code.
I just cracked it.

1018
01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:24.370
By the way. I'm at the MGM.

1019
01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.581
It's not like I'm slumming it
at the Tropicana.

1020
01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:30.168
As you can see. there's the MGM.
That's where I am.

1021
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.504
Anyway. Bob didn't like that song.

1022
01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.341
He goes "Jon. you're making me sound
like I'm gay."

1023
01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:40.053
And I said. "Well. who cares. Bob?
What's wrong with being gay?"

1024
01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.471
Nothing.

1025
01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:42.764
There's nothing wrong with being gay.

1026
01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:49.187
But it was costing him work.
as a leading man.

1027
01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:52.982
I said. "Bob. fine."
He goes "Write another song."

1028
01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.069
So I did.
it's called "Bob Saget Isn't Gay."

1029

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:04.494
He didn't like that.
You know?

1032
01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:10.875
I don't know what Bob was. but I know
"they" were a very good friend

1033
01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.043
of a lot of people.

1034
01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:16.589
"They" will be sorely missed.

1035
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:22.387
And by sorely missed. you know.
like. a lot of people.

1036
01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.472
Bob made sore.

1037
01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.307
And...

1038
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:29.811
I would imagine they would miss that.

1039
01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:33.147
By the way. the Scleroderma Foundation.
I just want you to know.

1040
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.983
I am performing here in Vegas.
and in honor of you.

1041
01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:39.862
I've decided ten percent of the money
I make from my shows will go...

1042
01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:41.572
to my agent.

1043
01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:45.952

a benefit for you guys for free.

1044

Yeah. I'm Jewish. I'm not an idiot.
All right.

1045
01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.624
So all of you people.
What are you doing?

1046
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.544
It's not like you're performing.
Come on. I know you bought a ticket.

1047
01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.170
How about more?
A little bit more.

1048
01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:58.172
Yeah. in honor of Bob.

1049

Don't feel guilty.

[Stamos. laughing] Jon Lovitz.

1051
01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:08.850
He hated those songs.

1052
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.770
And I always asked Lovitz to sing them
because they were so funny.

1147
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:31.584
Something you said. John.
really stayed with me. you know.

1148
01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:35.629
And it had something to do
with the relationship between...

1149
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.967
or the similarity
between comedy and blues

1150
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:41.969
in its relation to the truth.

1151
01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:45.306
And it's really stayed with me.

1152
01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:47.850

since you said it.

[strumming guitar chords]

1154
01:09:52.271 --> 01:09:56.066
For some reason. Bob really liked.
he liked a sad song.

1155
01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.238
And there's something
about what comedy does.

1156
01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:04.366
when it dispels your deepest sorrows

1157
01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:08.454
and deepest... fear. really.
