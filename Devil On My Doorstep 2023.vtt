So every junior
delivery dispatcher

59
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.667
starts off with two drivers.

everything runs smoothly

61

when they're offsite.

62
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.708
That includes communicating
with customers.

63
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.625
coordinating delivery times
or providing them with intel.

64
00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:33.625
Well. don't they have devices
for all of that?

65
00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:35.000
Theoretically. yes.

66
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:38.500
But our CEO likes a little bit
more of a hands-on approach.

67
00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:39.583

Every package is scanned before

72
00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:51.083
And every driver's scanner
is linked

73
00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:54.250
to their dispatcher's computer.
