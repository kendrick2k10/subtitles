589
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.149

like that.

590
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.579

591
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.559

hurting him?

592
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.379

So what I'm supposed to just
keep sneaking behind his back.

brothers bad side alright

607
00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.198

1129
01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.719
shit I don't know. I'm trying
to think

1130
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.139
stop moving!

1131
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.659
shut the fuck up!

1132
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.989
fuck you

1133
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:21.689
Shut the fuck

1134
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:22.279
up.

1135
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.299
Maybe

1136
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.398
maybe if we pay him and he'll
just give us the pictures

1137
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.899
instead of showing Daniel

1138
01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:34.999
I don't know

1139
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.199
That doesn't work.

1140
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.299
I'm gonna have to take him out.

1141
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:40.999
It's no other way.

1142
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.599
As in... Kill.

1143
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.199
Nah

1144
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:50.699
that's

1145
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.099
that's too far.

1146
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.499
Let's just leave

1147
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.399
you and me

1148
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.299
and

1149
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.999
get far away from him and
Daniel.

1150
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:02.259
Listen. I'll have it if that's
the only way

1151
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.199
It's not the only way

1152
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.599
if you kill him and go to jail
for Life.

1153
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.699
How are you going to be a
father to your son?

1154
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.299
What are you talking about
father?

1155
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:15.899
I don't have any kids.

1156
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:19.289
Not yet!

1157
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.319
Hold on

1158
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.319
are you serious right now

1159
01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.279
are you trying to tell me that
you're pregnant?

1160
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.209
yeah.

1161
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:29.949
I am.

1162
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:31.769
We're having a baby!

1163
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.249
wow

1164
01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.049
are you sure it's mine and not
my brothers?

1165
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.829
I've only been having sex with
you for the past 5 months!

1166
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.199
I'm sure it's yours.

1167
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.399
Wow.

1168
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:49.799
Okay.

1169
01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:53.999
Okay.

1170
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.399
Listen.

1171
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.899
You gonna move in with me
alright!

1172
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.299
I want you to go to the house.

1173
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.799
get all of your stuff.

1174
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.699
Are you serious?

1175
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:05.629
as a heart attack

1176
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.199
Are you coming with me?

1177
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.899
What if Daniel's home?

1178
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.099
listen

1179
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.119
He's still playing basketball
alright

1180
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.989
I'll head there to make sure
that he's still there

1181
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.989
I'll text you

1182
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:20.249
once I've gotten there okay.

1183
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.589
get all of your things out the
house

1184
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.639
because once you leave we're
not coming back

1185
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.148
okay

1186
01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:29.028
okay then

1187
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:30.599
I'll See you soon.

1188
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.398
-bullshit

1189
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:37.999
You know what?

1190
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.898
Get the fuck out of here.

1191
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.299
I'd better not see you around
here again.

1192
01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:40.799
Fuck you

1193
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:29.749
Daniel

1194
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:30.999
What are you doing here?

1195
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.799
I shouldn't be here

1196
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.389
I live here

1197
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.839
I just thought you was-

1198
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.259
you were at work

1199
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.898
I've decided to take the day
off.

1200
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.099
Imma be Right here.

1201
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:51.898
Are you okay?

1202
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.199
Yeah.

1203
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.199
Why would you ask that?

1204
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.799
because you're day drinking

1205
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.399
and you don't usually do that.

1206
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.399
Don't even worry about all that.

1207
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.299
Sit down.

1208
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.299
Now.

1209
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:32.999
Rachel-

1210
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.799
Do you remember the first time
we said. I love you.

1211
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.499
we said it so many times.

1212
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.199
I just

1213
01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.199
can't remember when the first
time was

1214
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.899
well. if you actually meant to
say it.

1215
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:58.999
you would remember it

1216
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.089
And if you was telling a lie
and I mean. you just wanted to

1217
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:03.999
forget it.

1218
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.299
See when I said it.

1219
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.699
I meant it.

1220
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.199
Because even at that time. I
remember every day.

1221
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.999
the place. the moment.

1222
01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:16.999
the park

1223
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.399
it was raining that day.

1224
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.699
and even for a Split Second.

1225
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.199
I know you had on heels.

1226
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.699
I had to carry you to the
shelter.

1227
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.799
To the point where no cars were
there

1228
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.399
about a mile off.

1229
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.399
And after I did all that.

1230
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.599
I knew. I have to tell you.

1231
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.699
I said it right to you.

1232
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.399
I love you.

1233
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.499
Do you remember that?

1234
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.699
Of course not you don't
remember that

1235
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.199
you don't remember anything
about me.

1236
01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.369
Don't-Do that Daniel

1237
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.799
It's not like that.

1238
01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.299
I may not remember every time
but

1239
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.899
I love you from the bottom of
my heart

1240
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.299
you know that

1241
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:07.699
you mean that?

1242
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.799
Do you really love me from the
bottom of your heart?

1243
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:14.799
Yes.

1244
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.499
What's in the envelope?

1245
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.199
Do you really mean it?

1246
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.199
When you say you love me.

1247
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.599
What's in this envelope?

1248
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.599
Doesn't even matter.

1249
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.399
I could put it all behind me.

1250
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:45.699
Rachel.

1251
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.599
will you marry me?

1252
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.599
I don't know what to say.

1253
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.099
I just

1254
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:12.899
can't right now.

1255
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:15.499
You can

1256
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.699
You just don't want to marry me.

1257
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.509
I can stop everything

1258
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:41.969
and make this work

1259
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:46.929
but when will you marry me?

1260
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:53.699
I don't know.

1261
01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.119
When you gone tell me what's
going on?

1262
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.699
How long has what been going on?

1263
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:25.899
Don't fucking play me.

1264
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:26.599

1453
01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.999
I really had hopes and dreams

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.599
