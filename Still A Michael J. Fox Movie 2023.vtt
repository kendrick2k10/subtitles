00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.616
<i>Florida. 1990.</i>

4
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.760
<i>I woke up with a ferocious hangover.</i>

5
00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.103
<i>I placed my left hand across the bridge
of my nose to block the sunlight.</i>

6
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.317
<i>A moth's wing fluttered
against my right cheek.</i>

7
00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.737
<i>I put my hand in front of my face</i>

8
00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.407
<i>so I could finger-flick
the little beastie across the room.</i>

9
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.245
<i>That's when I noticed my pinkie.</i>

10
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.042
<i>Auto animated.</i>

11
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.804
<i>"For Christ's sake.
it's just your freaking finger."</i>

12
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.891
<i>But it wasn't mine.</i>

13
00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:42.769
<i>Shit. It was somebody else's.</i>

14
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.022
<i>Had I hit my head?</i>

15
00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.818
<i>The tape of the previous night's events
was grainy at best.</i>

16
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.864
<i>Woody Harrelson was in the bar
the night before.</i>

17
00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:57.034
<i>Maybe we'd had
one of our legendary drunken fights.</i>

18
00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.334
<i>But I couldn't recall any such melee.</i>

19
00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.381
<i>I did recall how my bodyguard
had to prop me up against the doorframe</i>

20
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.759
<i>while he fumbled the key into the door
of my suite.</i>

21
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.014
<i>But I didn't feel any bumps. Fuck.</i>

22
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:19.973
{\an8}Action!

23
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.141
{\an8}Action. Michael!

24
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.768
Michael. Michael!

25
00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:26.146
<i>Here is as hot as you get
in the history of this business.</i>

26
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.773
<i>And the winner is Michael J. Fox.</i>

27
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.400
We're rolling.

28
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.569
<i>In the face of all evidence
to the contrary...</i>

29
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.697
- Very. very still. Mark.
- <i>...I was in an acid bath of fear...</i>

30
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:37.991
<i>and professional insecurity.</i>

31
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.546
<i>The trembling was a message...</i>

32
00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:55.968
<i>from the future.</i>

33
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.640
Everyone talks now
about owning their narrative.

34
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.851
So. the sad sack story is.

35
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.396
"Michael J. Fox gets this debilitating
disease. and it crushes him."

36
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.650
Yeah. that's boring.

37
00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:00.699
My hair went curly.
like. at like. like. at 49.

38
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.035
It never was curly.
and all of a sudden it went--

39
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:05.162
I woke up one morning in Santa Barbara
and my hair was curly.

40
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.956
- I think it's a good look.
- I can put some jam in it.

41
00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.000
- No.
- I can put a hat on.

42
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.296
It's just caring too much
about what I look like for a documentary.

43
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.589
Yeah. It's you.

44
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.468
Okay. now look at me.

45
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.345
There you go.

46
00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:23.055
- Coming in.
- Uh-oh.

47
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.183
Wha-- Guys. at a certain point it's just--

48
00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.018
- it just is what it is.
- Just right here.

49
00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:30.646
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.857
- How you doing?
- Yeah. I'm doing good.

51
00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:35.567
Watch me.

52
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.322
- How's your day going so far?
- So far?

53
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.077
So far it's successful.

54
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.204
Everyone knows you have Parkinson's.

55
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.581
but when they see you walking.
they're like. "Oh. fuck."

56
00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.083
Yeah.

57
00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:54.670
Good. Stop and reset.

58
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.381
Good. There we go.

59
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.092
The walking thing
really freaks people out.

60
00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:02.094
Look.

61
00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.097
But I won't hide it from you.

62
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:06.390
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.517
And you can do with it what you will.

64
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.187
If you pity me.
it's never gonna get to me.

65
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.731
I'm not pathetic.
I'm-- I got shit going on.

66
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:15.983
Hi. how you doing?

67
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.195
Take your time.

68
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.030
I'm a tough son of a bitch.

69
00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.700
I'm a cockroach.
and I've been through a lot of stuff.

70
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.827
- You can't kill a cockroach.
- Can't kill a cockroach.

71
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.996
Nice and slowly. nice and slowly.

72
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.330
There you go. Beautiful.

73
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.249
- Hey. how are you?
- Good. How are you?

74
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.792
Good. Stop and reset.

75
00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.003
Mr. Fox.

76
00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:42.050
That happened.

77
00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.096
- You got it?
- All right-- I'm okay. Thank you.

78
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.391
Okay. Nice to meet you. sir.

79
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.101
Nice to meet you.
You knocked me off my feet.

80
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:16.793
Before Parkinson's.
what did it mean to be still?

81
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:19.713
I wouldn't know.

82
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:22.382
I wouldn't know. I was never still.

83
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.521
<i>I can't pretend to remember
my two-year-old state of mind.</i>

84
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.652
<i>Knee-high. weighing little more than
a wet beach towel. and slippery quick.</i>

85
00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:46.031
<i>But it's likely that my motive
in wandering out the back door</i>

86
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.324
<i>was not to escape.</i>

87
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.202
<i>More likely.
I failed to recognize boundaries.</i>

88
00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:53.747
<i>When the phone rang a few minutes later.</i>

89
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.708
<i>the proprietor of the candy store tried
to contain his amusement.</i>

90
00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:00.045
<i>"Got your son here."</i>

91
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:03.507
<i>I can easily picture my mother
in utter disbelief that I'd bolted.</i>

92
00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.217
<i>"Let him have a candy or something.</i>

93
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.553
<i>My husband will be right there
to pick him up and pay for it."</i>

94
00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:09.972
<i>"He's got money."</i>

95
00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.684
<i>"He's got quite a bit of money.
as a matter of fact."</i>

96
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.482
<i>As a kid.
I lacked the faith required to be still.</i>

97
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.820
<i>It is one of the great ironies in my life.</i>

98
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.614
<i>I couldn't be still
until I could literally...</i>

99
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.493
<i>no longer keep still.</i>

100
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:42.588
<i>When my baby sister arrived.
I wasn't jealous.</i>

101
00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.923
<i>What the hell. the more the merrier.</i>

102
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.720
<i>But by the time I was six
and she was three. we were the same size.</i>

103
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:54.099
<i>I have a specific memory
of being asked if we were twins.</i>

104
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.144
<i>but once told that my twin
was actually three years younger.</i>

105
00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.812
<i>people's reactions changed.</i>

106
00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:02.482
<i>I realized that I was expected
to be bigger.</i>

107
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.943
<i>This was a new one on me.</i>

108
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.156
<i>I couldn't do "bigger."</i>

109
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:13.285
{\an8}I was the shortest in my class.

110
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.704
{\an8}Shorter than any of the people
I played hockey with.

111
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.207
I was the guy who'd climb down
into the grate and get the ball.

112
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.170
{\an8}But I used to get my ass kicked.
I was a little guy.

113
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:27.633
I'd get stuffed in lockers.

114
00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:35.557
{\an8}If big guys are purposely coming
after you. and then fucking hammering you...

115
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.770
<i>But I'd always relied on my ability
to run from any potential bully.</i>

116
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.650
<i>Just when the earth seemed
to be sliding out from beneath me.</i>

117
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.528
<i>I stumbled onto a foothold.</i>

118
00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:52.783
<i>Drama class.</i>

119
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:56.954
<i>That's where the girls were.</i>

120
00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:00.958
And I was Rumpelstiltskin in a play.

121
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.877
- You were Rumpelstiltskin?
- I was Rumpelstiltskin. yeah.

122
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.217
You also looked five years younger.

123
00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:12.886
Yeah. I was just a little elf.

124
00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.599
I was cute and elfin. I was a cute elf.

125
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.809
A cute elf.

126
00:09:22.104 --> 00:09:23.772
In drama class. you could be big.

127
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.400
In drama class. you could be anything.

128
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.779
<i>But my head was up my ass
if you asked my father.</i>

129
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:37.077
<i>Dad was a pragmatist. determined to
protect his family from romantic fantasy.</i>

130
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.374
<i>He'd had dreams as a young boy. but they'd
been effectively knocked out of him.</i>

131
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.919
He had a certain amount of rage.

132
00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:50.132
You'd see his lip curl.
and you knew you were in trouble.

133
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:53.468
Then you'd go. "Oh. shit. I'm fucked now."

134
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:59.933
<i>A call from the principal's office
meant a harsh reprimand from Dad.</i>

135
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.938
And he'd say. "Goddamn it! Goddamn it."

136
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.067
<i>I began to spend more
of my time smoking and drinking.</i>

137
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.361
<i>And I became a serial fender bender...</i>

138
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.449
<i>inflicting damage to my dad's cars.</i>

139
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:19.411
So. in his mind. you're a fuckup.

140
00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:22.206
Yeah. a potential fuckup.

141
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:27.878
Hey. Looking good.

142
00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:31.423
These shoes are terrific.
Now I got a fighting chance.

143
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.218
<i>When I was 16.</i>

144
00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:37.304
<i>my acting teacher
thrust a newspaper into my hands.</i>

145
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.223
<i>"They're looking for a bright
12-year-old kid.</i>

146
00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:42.351
<i>and hell. you'd be the brightest
12-year-old kid they're ever gonna meet."</i>

147
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:45.812
But I'm gonna blow it. Leo.
All those people looking at me.

148
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.148
We're ready for you in Makeup.

149
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.943
You're gonna make history. kid.

150
00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:55.030
Gotta grow an inch by Friday.

151
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.991
<i>I got the part. It was that easy.</i>

152
00:10:58.992 --> 00:10:59.993
Basketball tryouts?

153
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.079
No. Penny Montgomery.

154
00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.749
If I stand real close.
I can't see her face.

155
00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:11.129
<i>The casting director believed
I held an advantage.</i>

156
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.132
<i>American producers would be eager
to hire an actor</i>

157
00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.843
<i>who looked young enough to play a kid.</i>

158
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:20.222
<i>But that meant moving to Hollywood
and dropping out of high school.</i>

159
00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:24.726
<i>And that seemed inconceivable.</i>

160
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:29.398
<i>Dad.
"Are you sure this is what you wanna do?"</i>

161
00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.109
<i>Me. "Absolutely."</i>

162
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.403
<i>"You're that confident?"</i>

163
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.363
<i>"Absolutely."</i>

164
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:41.159
<i>And then Dad shocked me.</i>

165
00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:45.831
<i>"Well. if you're gonna be a lumberjack.</i>

166
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:47.875
<i>you might as well go
to the goddamn forest."</i>

167
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.629
So. secretly. he believed in you.

168
00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:55.340
Yeah.

169
00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.222
<i>Dad agreed to underwrite the adventure.</i>

170
00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:05.184
<i>putting the whole trip on his Visa card.</i>

171
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.472
<i>I remember thinking just how far Dad
and I had come over the past few weeks.</i>

172
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.937
<i>He advised me that he'd just drive
to the appointments</i>

173
00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:51.688
<i>and debrief me after each one.</i>

174
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.318
<i>His way of signaling to me
that this was my show. not his.</i>

175
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.451
Hello.

176
00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:07.788
No. that's perfect.

177
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:11.375
<i>Every audition earned a callback.</i>

178
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.877
<i>and three of the callbacks produced
solid offers.</i>

179
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:21.802
<i>"You've got the world by the tail."
Dad said. "Just hold on."</i>

180
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:29.142
<i>My studio apartment was
in the slums of Beverly Hills.</i>

181
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.481
<i>It's the prettiest house
I ever seen in my life.</i>

182
00:13:35.274 --> 00:13:37.776
<i>Well. I was just thinking I'm glad
you came home with me.</i>

183
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:45.534
<i>The apartment was 17-by-12 feet.
One mattress. one hot plate.</i>

184
00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:50.122
<i>with a microscopic bathroom
and the domicile's one and only sink.</i>

185
00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:57.129
<i>I washed my hair with Palmolive
and my dishes with Head & Shoulders.</i>

186
00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:04.595
<i>I really had a great time tonight.</i>

187
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.267
<i>I enlisted Ronald McDonald
as my exclusive nutritionist.</i>

188
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:18.442
- <i>We alone?</i>
- <i>Alone?</i>

189
00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:22.196
<i>I mean. is your husband lurking about?</i>

190
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:25.407
<i>But by the spring of 1982...</i>

191
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.491
Schweitzer.

192
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.410
<i>...the scenario was grim.</i>

193
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.162
What's going on here? What is this?

194
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:33.540
Please relax. Mr. Wyatt.
I'm going to examine your chest.

195
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.210
- Hey. is this a joke or something?
- Hi.

196
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.128
<i>I continued to pick up acting jobs.</i>

197
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.131
<i>but they barely earned me enough
to live on.</i>

198
00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.218
<i>My agent took 10% of my paycheck.</i>

199
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:45.469
Your paycheck.

200
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.680
<i>And then there was the photographer.
publicist or lawyer.</i>

201
00:14:49.515 --> 00:14:52.392
- It says "$1.25."
- Yeah. so?

202
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.311
I'm telling you it's wrong.
It's a mistake!

203
00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:58.190
I worked hard for this. It's not fair.

204
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.025
<i>I worked too hard for this.</i>

205
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:01.860
<i>I began to liquidate.</i>

206
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.489
<i>I sold off my sectional sofa
section by section.</i>

207
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.996
<i>I came close on a couple of movies.
Most notably.</i> Ordinary People.

208
00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:16.458
<i>But Robert Redford seemed less than
impressed by my reading.</i>

209
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.961
<i>He spent the audition flossing his teeth.</i>

210
00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:23.799
Why did they have to come here
in the first place?

211
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.385
<i>The rejection can be so matter-of-fact</i>

212
00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:28.846
<i>that there's a danger
you'll get numbed by it.</i>

213
00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:31.890
Don't listen to those that
don't know what they're talking about.

214
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.185
<i>I was down to days.</i>

215
00:15:37.855 --> 00:15:41.358
So. you're running out of
money. That's all that--

216
00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:45.821
I wa-- "Running out" is generous.
I had no money.

217
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:48.866
- I was taking jam packets from IHOPs.
- What's that?

218
00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.826
- Like. just-- Smucker's.

219
00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:52.077
- Why?
- To eat.

220
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.746
- Come on.
- And I wa--

221
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.374
I was finding quarters
and nickels and dimes.

222
00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.377
and I'd use that to get to the next
moment. I was living beat to beat.

223
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.297
And I said. "I gotta get out of here.
I have no money.

224
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:07.467
and I owe the IRS money. and I'm
ducking the landlord. and I got no phone."

225
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.595
I mean. I have to walk to the airport.

226
00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:12.222
- What was the expectation?
- I-- My expectation was.

227
00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.807
my brother's
a construction superintendent.

228
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.393
and I'd be working on his sites
picking up nails.

229
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:21.732
But I still had a chip and a chair.

230
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:24.693
A what?

231
00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.946
Playing poker. as long as you got
a chip left and a chair to sit in.

232
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:30.365
you're in the game.
You got a chip and a chair.

233
00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.208
This was it. This was my last shot.

234
00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:50.469
<i>"You gotta stop hawking me
about this kid."</i>

235
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:54.348
<i>producer Gary David Goldberg told
the casting director of his new sitcom.</i>

236
00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.600
We don't wanna get into an area
where we're bringing someone on

237
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.019
who's not funny. You know. and there's
not any comedy there.

238
00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.438
<i>"There's no way
I'm gonna change my mind on this.</i>

239
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.023
<i>He's just not our guy."</i>

240
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.527
I think we all feel
that Alex is super competent.

241
00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:09.905
you know. editor of the paper.
but sympathetic underneath.

242
00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:12.741
<i>"I know what I want. and I'm telling you.</i>

243
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.577
<i>I don't want Michael Fox
playing Alex Keaton."</i>

244
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.415
No. I want this job. I need it.
I can do it.

245
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.709
Everywhere I've been.
there's always been something wrong.

246
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:26.922
Too young. too old. too short. too tall.
Whatever the exception is. I can fix it.

247
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:29.550
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

248
00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:38.100
- Here we go. Ready? In five.
- Five. four. three. two!

249
00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:45.482
Wait. I'm sorry.
my script just went to pieces.

250
00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:49.444
- Where is it? Shit.
- Top of 11.

251
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.613
"It's his first day of kindergarten. Mom.

252
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:54.032
He doesn't wanna be late.
This could affect his entire life."

253
00:17:55.701 --> 00:17:58.996
"Mal's right. After all. this
is my alma mater. I am a legend there."

254
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.126
And they laughed. And I just went--

255
00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:10.465
It was just. like... a wash of. like. "Wow."

256
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:11.633
"I got one too."

257
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.350
There's no drink. there's no drug.
there's no woman. there's no-- nothing

258
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.187
that can touch that moment for me
as a 22-year-old guy

259
00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.064
who'd been fighting for three years
to make it.

260
00:18:26.732 --> 00:18:28.025
"Good. good. good. good. good."

261
00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:32.779
Laughter is-- You can't help it.

262
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.073
I-- Like. I just found something.

263
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:38.577
a way to communicate with you that
you didn't expect. you have no--

264
00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:41.663
you have no answer for it.
except to make a noise.

265
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.748
"...kidding me? Come"--

266
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.757
If you didn't have any. you'd have
to let air out. It's really honest.

267
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.011
<i>Gary David Goldberg leaned back
in his chair and said.</i>

268
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.639
<i>"Why didn't anybody tell me
about this kid?"</i>

269
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:01.308
Great.

270
00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:06.104
<i>I was standing at a pay phone
outside of a Pioneer Chicken franchise.</i>

271
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.608
<i>While my agent was talking
about a seven-figure salary.</i>

272
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.822
<i>I stared at the menu wishing I had
$1.99 to buy the buffalo wings.</i>

273
00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.035
<i>The contract could not be officially
locked in. however.</i>

274
00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:25.290
<i>as the NBC executive wunderkind
head of programming. Brandon Tartikoff.</i>

275
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.126
<i>was absolutely against giving me
the role of Alex Keaton.</i>

276
00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:32.673
This guy is very proficient.
and he hits the comedy.

277
00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:37.594
but I don't think we're talking about
somebody who's gonna be on a lunch box.

278
00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:42.099
<i>It would be a relatively simple
matter for me to be fired and replaced.</i>

279
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:47.646
<i>The argument raged on right up to the day
we began shooting the pilot.</i>

280
00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:01.243
So. welcome to <i>Family Ties</i>. everybody.

281
00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:02.703
Andy. we ready to go?

282
00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:05.664
<i>Whatever happened in the next hour
was gonna decide my fate.</i>

283
00:20:05.664 --> 00:20:08.000
The guys will bring down the house lights.

284
00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.021
Start your VTRs. please.
Start your machines.

285
00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.565
Okay. Paul. you got the first shot.

286
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:34.651
- Have a good show. everyone.
- Three. two...

287
00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:38.530
Here we go. We're ready. And action. Go.

288
00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:43.535
Hello. May I tell him who's calling?

289
00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.370
Kimberly Blanton.

290
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.747
- Kimberly.
- I'm sorry...

291
00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.916
<i>From the moment I ad-libbed
the initial P...</i>

292
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.584
Alex P. Keaton here.

293
00:20:56.048 --> 00:20:58.592
<i>...I felt as though the audience
was aware of my desperate days</i>

294
00:20:58.592 --> 00:20:59.885
<i>leading up to that moment.</i>

295
00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:04.598
Hi. Sorry I had to answer the door myself.
Our butler's off tonight.

296
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.191
If Kimberly doesn't like your family
for who they are.

297
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:17.402
then maybe she isn't worth caring
about at all. don't you think?

298
00:21:18.487 --> 00:21:20.906
Are you gonna wear your hair like that.
or are you gonna put it up?

299
00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:28.789
Michael J. Fox!

300
00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:33.252
This is working.

301
00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:42.553
I just knew at that moment. like...
it was all gonna come true.

302
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:43.762
<i>Mom. what are you doing?</i>

303
00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:47.015
<i>The situation comedy
was supposed to focus on the parents.</i>

304
00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.100
<i>No bananas. Ma.</i>

305
00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:53.438
<i>Instead.
America fell in love with their son.</i>

306
00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:56.400
Play towards Michael. That'd help her.
And here on out to play towards Michael.

307
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.568
<i>Okay. he'll be fine.</i>

308
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.195
<i>His performance is so good.</i>

309
00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:05.325
<i>Watching him. you are struck
by his exquisite sense of timing.</i>

310
00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:11.123
I find a sense of humor in a man
to be incredibly sexually exciting.

311
00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:15.711
A priest and a rabbi are in a room.

312
00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:21.258
<i>When did you discover
that you liked to make people laugh?</i>

313
00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:23.385
<i>When I was growing up. I was a small kid.</i>

314
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.804
<i>It was either. you know.
funny or fight. so...</i>

315
00:22:25.804 --> 00:22:28.182
The idea is always
if you can make the big guy laugh

316
00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:31.393
before you can make him mad at you.
it's a safer way to go.

317
00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:33.645
- Cue.
- Alex. come on. admit it.

318
00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:35.022
You're really special.

319
00:22:35.898 --> 00:22:37.357
All right. I--

320
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.694
I don't wanna get in an argument
about this.

321
00:22:44.156 --> 00:22:50.370
Mr. Fox sent me this lunch box.

322
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.709
{\an8}Affectionately signed. "Brandon.
love and kisses. Michael J. Fox."

323
00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:25.280
When I'm with you. I can see in your eyes

324
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.452
that you've got a great one-liner and that
it's hard to get that to your mouth.

325
00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:33.288
I-- It just sucks. It's really hard.

326
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:38.919
When I'm really in need of dopamine and--

327
00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:42.881
at the end of a dose--
I'm getting close to that now.

328
00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:47.594
I get frozen and I--
Frozen physically and frozen facially.

329
00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:51.139
It's a mask. I have a parkinsonian mask.

330
00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:53.517
I-- Just. I have to really work--

331
00:23:53.517 --> 00:23:56.645
to struggle to smile. to show expression.

332
00:23:57.563 --> 00:24:00.065
It gives me a kind of blank countenance.

333
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:03.193
If you were having pure exhilaration.

334
00:24:03.193 --> 00:24:06.321
- what would your face look like?
- Like this.

335
00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:11.910
This is what you did for a living.

336
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.995
Yeah.

337
00:24:26.925 --> 00:24:28.093
And stop.

338
00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:32.848
Okay. You feel warmed up?
Is it making you light-headed?

339
00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:35.475
It's making me crazy.

340
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:38.854
Okay. we're gonna do some pages
from your book.

341
00:24:38.854 --> 00:24:41.940
Okay.
"After my dad retired from the Army..."

342
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.025
Little straighter.

343
00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:46.904
Why do you wanna tell
this story right now?

344
00:24:55.621 --> 00:24:59.208
"As a kid. many things seemed
to come easily to me.

345
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:02.169
I'd read a big picture book
cover to cover..."

346
00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:03.754
My world is getting smaller.

347
00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:06.298
I love my mind.
and I love the place it takes me.

348
00:25:06.298 --> 00:25:09.468
and I just don't want that
to get cut short.

349
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:13.430
"As a kid. many things seemed
to come easily to me..."

350
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.767
Is there gonna be a moment--
maybe it's 20 years from now--

351
00:25:16.767 --> 00:25:19.102
where you can't tell your story?

352
00:25:20.062 --> 00:25:21.480
Well. if I'm here 20 years from now.

353
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.152
I'll be-- I'd either be cured
or. like. a pickle.

354
00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:32.407
"I had to eat my lunch through a s--
I had to eat my lunch through a straw...

355
00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:39.206
with several layers
of form-fitted rubber foam

356
00:25:39.206 --> 00:25:42.042
studded with yak hair affixed on my face."
That's actually really. like--

357
00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:43.877
- Who wrote that stuff?
- Some asshole.

358
00:25:48.173 --> 00:25:49.633
It was a low-budget B movie.

359
00:25:51.885 --> 00:25:53.887
But down the street were professionals.

360
00:25:57.224 --> 00:25:58.433
What were those guys doing?

361
00:25:59.685 --> 00:26:03.730
They're with the new Zemeckis
and Spielberg movie. Who's in it?

362
00:26:04.565 --> 00:26:05.482
Crispin Glover.

363
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.901
Ouch.

364
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.239
It stung a little bit that Crazy Crispin
was gonna do a Spielberg movie

365
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.200
while I--

366
00:26:17.703 --> 00:26:20.122
Thrown away on some B-grade
high school werewolf movie.

367
00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:29.506
<i>A day or two after our Christmas break.</i>

368
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:33.760
<i>Gary David Goldberg had summoned me
into his office.</i>

369
00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:40.142
<i>"I have a confession to make." Gary began.</i>

370
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.855
<i>"Just before the start of the season.
Steven sent me a copy of this script."</i>

371
00:26:46.481 --> 00:26:48.901
<i>Whenever Gary said "Steven."
I knew he meant Spielberg.</i>

372
00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:54.615
{\an8}<i>"Steven had wanted you for the lead role.</i>

373
00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:57.576
{\an8}<i>They came to me asking if there was
any way I could let you outta the show.</i>

374
00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:02.289
<i>I didn't mention it to you then.
because it was just impossible.</i>

375
00:27:16.386 --> 00:27:18.722
<i>They started shooting
a couple of months ago with Eric Stoltz.</i>

376
00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:20.974
<i>but they don't think he's the right fit
for the role.</i>

377
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:27.397
<i>It's gonna be expensive.
but they wanna reshoot all of his stuff."</i>

378
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:30.692
<i>My head was spinning.</i>

379
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.905
Anything else?

380
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:37.699
<i>"You're not gonna miss
an hour of work on the show."</i>

381
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.374
<i>The deal was made.</i>

382
00:27:49.461 --> 00:27:51.880
<i>A Teamster driver would pick me up
at 9:30 a.m.</i>

383
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.842
<i>and take me to Paramount...</i>

384
00:27:57.302 --> 00:27:59.680
<i>where I would spend
the day shooting</i> Family Ties.

385
00:28:02.182 --> 00:28:03.183
Hi. how you doing?

386
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.061
{\an8}You think you can handle both jobs?

387
00:28:10.107 --> 00:28:11.358
That's for me.

388
00:28:16.363 --> 00:28:19.199
<i>Then at 6:00. another Teamster
driver would pick me up and shuttle me</i>

389
00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:22.244
<i>to whatever far-flung location
we were based at that evening.</i>

390
00:28:40.262 --> 00:28:41.388
{\an8}Action!

391
00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:43.390
Wait a minute. Doc.

392
00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:47.477
Are you telling me that you built
a time machine...

393
00:28:48.854 --> 00:28:49.897
out of a DeLorean?

394
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:55.527
<i>I would work on the film
until just before sunrise.</i>

395
00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:03.535
<i>At that point. I'd climb
into the back of a production van</i>

396
00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:04.953
<i>with a pillow and a blanket</i>

397
00:29:05.704 --> 00:29:08.207
<i>and yet another Teamster driver
would take me home again.</i>

398
00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:13.295
<i>I catch two or three hours of sleep...</i>

399
00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.719
<i>before Teamster driver number one
would reappear at my apartment.</i>

400
00:29:21.303 --> 00:29:23.013
<i>let himself in with a key I provided.</i>

401
00:29:24.264 --> 00:29:25.265
<i>brew a pot of coffee.</i>

402
00:29:26.642 --> 00:29:27.518
<i>turn on the shower.</i>

403
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:32.898
<i>And then start
the whole process all over again.</i>

404
00:29:40.155 --> 00:29:41.490
Hello!

405
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.158
- Alex. you're an hour late.
- Yes?

406
00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:44.826
So. how's your new job. Alex?

407
00:29:45.536 --> 00:29:48.330
It's great. It's really great.

408
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.332
That's my ride. I gotta be in early today.

409
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.465
- Mark.
- Action!

410
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.437
Okay. guys and dolls!

411
00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:13.981
<i>For the next three-and-a-half months.</i>

412
00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:17.234
<i>the combination of</i> Back to the Future
<i>and</i> Family Ties <i>swallowed me whole.</i>

413
00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:20.112
Take 22.

414
00:30:20.112 --> 00:30:22.781
{\an8}<i>I experienced confusion
as to what set I was on</i>

415
00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:26.451
<i>and basically who I was
in the first place.</i>

416
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.163
You've worked every afternoon
and evening for the past two weeks.

417
00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:42.718
<i>How could any of this shit be any good?</i>

418
00:30:48.932 --> 00:30:50.726
- How you doing today?
- I'm good. How are you?

419
00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:53.145
Good. Tired.

420
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.901
- What happened here?
- I smashed my head.

421
00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:05.574
I was walking really fast.
and I fell into this piece of furniture.

422
00:31:06.575 --> 00:31:10.037
I didn't hit the furniture the way
I usually do. and I hit it with my face.

423
00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:12.080
And I-- For a second.
I was lying on the ground.

424
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.208
and I said. "I think I fucked myself."

425
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:19.129
And then I started to bruise.
and my eyes went black. My--

426
00:31:19.129 --> 00:31:22.090
This eye went really black.
And then they did X-rays.

427
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.886
and they said that "You broke all
the bones in your cheek and your eye."

428
00:31:26.512 --> 00:31:30.557
And they did surgery and went in
and fixed it and put pins in it.

429
00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:32.601
I had pins here and here.

430
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.978
- Here. Yeah.
- You had pins in there?

431
00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:37.773
So. yeah. So. I smashed my face up.
but I do that.

432
00:31:37.773 --> 00:31:41.735
Like. I do. like--
It's part of the deal is that I fall.

433
00:31:41.735 --> 00:31:44.321
- It's the real deal.
- Parkinson's and gravity are real.

434
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:47.699
Yeah. gravity is real. Even if
you're only falling from my height.

435
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.245
Okay. we're back to business.

436
00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:53.872
{\an8}The story of me. take two.

437
00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:03.799
Jesus. my head.

438
00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:07.261
Where the hell am I?

439
00:32:11.974 --> 00:32:12.850
Hello?

440
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.393
<i>"Mike. we just saw the movie."</i>

441
00:32:14.393 --> 00:32:15.310
What movie?

442
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.271
<i>"Your movie.</i> Back to the Future.<i>"</i>

443
00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:21.149
<i>The person calling me was my agent.</i>

444
00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:24.528
I'm sorry. Pete. I know I suck.

445
00:32:25.737 --> 00:32:29.032
<i>If this was the beginning
of the end. it had been a hell of a ride.</i>

446
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:32.786
<i>I'm Roger Ebert.
film critic of the</i> Chicago Sun-Times.

film critic of the</i> Chicago Tribune.

448
00:32:36.206 --> 00:32:39.501
<i>First.</i> Back to the Future.
<i>A time travel movie. a category I hate.</i>

449
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:42.546
<i>because you're never really gonna change
things when they go back in the past.</i>

450
00:32:42.546 --> 00:32:45.090
<i>because that would mean that the future
that we saw at the beginning of the film</i>

451
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.633
<i>would've had to have been a lie. right?</i>

452
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:49.511
But. <i>Back to the Future</i> managed
to beat that problem.

453
00:32:49.511 --> 00:32:51.471
<i>and it delighted me in so doing.</i>

454
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:54.057
<i>This is my favorite film
of the summer movie season.</i>

455
00:32:55.142 --> 00:32:58.353
<i>And Michael J. Fox gives
an absolutely winning performance.</i>

456
00:32:59.104 --> 00:33:02.774
<i>The ride. it turned out.
was only beginning.</i>

457
00:33:15.787 --> 00:33:18.457
How are you doing
with the early word on this movie?

458
00:33:18.457 --> 00:33:20.125
The early word is "spectacular."

459
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:22.711
- Kind of frightening. yes.
- Scary. Yeah. it's really scary.

460
00:33:26.882 --> 00:33:29.301
- Will you be the same guy?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:31.553
- Will you handle it well?
- Yeah.

Michael J. Fox is with us tonight. Yeah!

476
00:34:31.864 --> 00:34:33.574
Doesn't that make you just feel fabulous?

477
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:36.994
That's great. It cost a lot to fly

{\an8}from another Michael J. Fox movie.
Is it gonna give it a run for its money?

482
00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:51.925
{\an8}I don't know.

Well.
you're just gonna have to tell Spielberg.

485
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:07.941

I can't believe I was about to say
acting is my life.

489
00:35:17.075 --> 00:35:19.912
TV's Emmy Awards were handed out.
and the winners are...

00:35:23.248 --> 00:35:25.792
{\an8}I don't believe this! Great!

491
00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.504
I feel four feet tall.

492
00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:32.716
And I always see your name
with "adorable" in front of it.

493
00:35:32.716 --> 00:35:35.093
Now. does this get a little annoying
after a while?

494
00:35:35.093 --> 00:35:36.803
Yeah. well. I-- My mom writes
for these magazines.

495
00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:37.888
Is that right?

496
00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:40.432
I think Michael Fox is cute.

497
00:35:40.432 --> 00:35:43.810
I think Michael Fox is really cute.
And I'd go out with him anytime.

498
00:35:45.521 --> 00:35:49.316
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I had a really. really good time.</i>

499
00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:53.195
- Who are you sleeping with?
- Who are you sleeping with?

500
00:35:57.658 --> 00:36:00.327
I wasn't gonna ask you. It's Shelley.
I was gonna go right back to--

501
00:36:00.327 --> 00:36:01.578
But you did.

502
00:36:01.578 --> 00:36:02.955
Because--

503
00:36:02.955 --> 00:36:05.207
I still don't get it. I'm like--

504
00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:10.128
I mean. I still have no idea
what people see. but--

505
00:36:12.798 --> 00:36:14.675
I have a favorite beer.
I don't know if I can mention it.

506
00:36:14.675 --> 00:36:18.303
but it's a Canadian beer. and it has
a certain antlered animal on the front.

507
00:36:19.429 --> 00:36:23.559
<i>One morning. I peered out
the window to see a beer delivery truck.</i>

508
00:36:25.727 --> 00:36:28.564
<i>"There's a lot more where this came
from." the delivery guy said.</i>

509
00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:33.193
<i>I owned a Ferrari. a Range Rover.
a Jeep Cherokee.</i>

510
00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:35.988
<i>a Mercedes 560 SL convertible.</i>

511
00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:50.878
<i>The booze was free.
and I was usually the guest of honor.</i>

512
00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:11.064
I had a guy who pulled over my Ferrari
one time on the way to work.

513
00:37:11.064 --> 00:37:13.025
And-- And the cop leans in. he goes.

514
00:37:14.193 --> 00:37:16.320
"Mike. is that you?" And I say. "Yeah."
He said.

515
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.863
"This is a big. heavy car.
You gotta be careful."

516
00:37:17.863 --> 00:37:20.032
I was going 90 down Ventura Boulevard
in a Ferrari.

517
00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:22.242
And he said. "Love the show."

518
00:37:23.452 --> 00:37:25.495
I said. "That's it?"

519
00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:28.540
- So. five steps forward.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:32.419
If your left foot catches.
you stop and reset when you can.

521
00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:35.005
I'm not gonna stop you.
but you stop when you can.

522
00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:38.050
- It's locking-- My knees are locking out.
- Good.

523
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:39.927
- Yeah. I can do this without--
- So. settle into this.

524
00:37:39.927 --> 00:37:43.972
Bounce into it. Feel those heels. Turn.
Know that you're settled.

525
00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:45.015
There's that period of time

526
00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:47.976
- that I was the king of the world.
- Good. Golf stance again. don't lock out.

527
00:37:47.976 --> 00:37:51.146
And I was playing a part.
I was playing a--

528
00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:55.067
And then that was worth feeling sorry for.

529
00:37:56.902 --> 00:37:57.903
How's Tracy?

530
00:37:58.403 --> 00:38:00.656
Married to me. Still.

531
00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:05.244
With the life of a young celebrity
that gets a lot of fame really fast.

532
00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:07.120
you don't know what's real.

533
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.457
People taking pictures of-- in my bushes
of me in the swimming pool.

534
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:15.629
Walking down the street with a hat on
and glasses and down and hiding.

535
00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:18.340
It's all bullshit.
It's not the real stuff.

536
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.759
- Big step right.
- No.

537
00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:23.178
Big step right. Good. Golf stance again.

538
00:38:25.764 --> 00:38:28.350
Good. This is the stuff
that we need to work on.

539
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:31.103
Slowing down your thought process. right?

540
00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:33.814
- And this is the area that you need work.
- Yeah. I do.

541
00:38:33.814 --> 00:38:35.649
- So. it's slowing down.
- Yeah.

542
00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:38.902
Right? So. stand up. hit the golf stance.
In your heels.

543
00:38:39.403 --> 00:38:40.737
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

544
00:38:40.737 --> 00:38:43.365
Do that quarter step around the stool.

545
00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:46.285
Parkinson's was just a disaster.

546
00:38:47.286 --> 00:38:50.247
But it's so real.

547
00:38:50.247 --> 00:38:52.875
When my arm would seize up
or my hand would twitch.

548
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:54.710
that's real. It's real.

549
00:38:55.294 --> 00:38:57.880
Turn. Make sure you're settled.

550
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:02.551
Good. Make sure you're settled.

551
00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:05.012
You can't walk
and you can't go to the bathroom.

552
00:39:05.012 --> 00:39:06.889
I mean. that's real.

553
00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:08.557
Slowly forward.

554
00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:14.062
Beautiful. Awesome. I know you can do it.

555
00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:16.148
- I can do it. That's the thing--
- Right?

556
00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:18.442
That's the thing that kills me.
is just that they're not--

557
00:39:18.442 --> 00:39:20.569
- The instant lack of control.
- Right.

558
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:22.279
It's not like.
"I'm losing control. I'm losing control."

559
00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:23.864
- It's like. boom! I'm flying--
- So. that's what we--

560
00:39:23.864 --> 00:39:28.035
But that's what we always talk about is
that. your speed. because of who you are.

561
00:39:28.035 --> 00:39:31.288
- I wanna get it done. Yeah.
- Just slow it down. slow it down.

562
00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:35.334
Because you're athletic enough
to then have time to compensate

563
00:39:35.334 --> 00:39:38.462
- for something that goes wrong.
- Yeah. why dash when you can flush?

564
00:39:38.462 --> 00:39:41.089
Right. See? That was even better.

565
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:44.218
Talking to you as a movie star
is different than talking to you as a TV--

566
00:39:44.218 --> 00:39:46.345
Well. I'm much more impressive now.

567
00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:48.972
Well. you are.
Has your life changed because of this?

568
00:39:48.972 --> 00:39:50.140
Not really.

569
00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:52.351
- To Joan.
- To who?

570
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:53.810
Joan. J-O-A-N.

571
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:56.230
<i>Whether it's signing an autograph</i>

572
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.440
<i>or dashing off to your next interview.</i>

573
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.902
<i>it's all part of selling Michael J. Fox
and the movie.</i>

574
00:40:08.617 --> 00:40:10.911
<i>His family must have
wondered how he'd turn out</i>

575
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.621
<i>when he dropped out of high school.</i>

576
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:16.083
When we go down to visit him. we
try and spend our time with Michael.

577
00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:20.337
and we'll go with him
to any such events that he wants us to.

578
00:40:20.337 --> 00:40:22.297
But. no. we don't--

579
00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:25.843
We don't get tied up in the show business
end of it all. really.

580
00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:28.637
<i>In the backyard. he's just Mike Fox.</i>

581
00:40:28.637 --> 00:40:31.974
<i>not the star.
Michael J. Fox people have come to know.</i>

582
00:40:31.974 --> 00:40:35.519
<i>He says trips home from Los Angeles
help keep his feet on the ground.</i>

583
00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:39.273
They're not gonna let me get away
with being a jerk.

584
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.191
Very quiet. please.

585
00:40:44.236 --> 00:40:47.990
I guess you could say I've always wanted
to excel. even as a small--

586
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.827
No. Ready. Count me down again
will you. Andy? I gotta get--

587
00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:55.330
Five. four. three. two.

588
00:40:55.831 --> 00:40:58.083
I don't know. I guess you could say
I've always wanted to excel.

589
00:40:58.584 --> 00:40:59.793
even as a small boy.

590
00:41:00.669 --> 00:41:03.046
I mean. it wasn't the winning
that mattered to me...

591
00:41:05.132 --> 00:41:08.051
it was the pure enjoyment
of the competition.

592
00:41:09.428 --> 00:41:11.430
And I've always felt
that deep in my heart--

593
00:41:14.641 --> 00:41:17.186
Totally losing momentum.
Can we just start from the top?

594
00:41:17.853 --> 00:41:20.272
- Absolutely.
- Trying to get a kick on this.

595
00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:25.360
<i>On the set of</i> Family Ties<i>.
I was welcomed back like the prodigal son.</i>

596
00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:28.155
<i>I was the star. after all.</i>

597
00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:29.615
Mikey. you're gonna do this now?

598
00:41:29.615 --> 00:41:32.284
It just occurred to me.
it doesn't work over there.

599
00:41:32.284 --> 00:41:33.452
Does this bother you?

600
00:41:33.452 --> 00:41:35.621
- Does this screw you?
- No. we just gotta redo

601
00:41:35.621 --> 00:41:36.997
- more shots.

602
00:41:36.997 --> 00:41:38.498
- How many?
- Thirty-eight.

603
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:41.168
<i>And while I would have never dreamed
of lording it over anyone.</i>

604
00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:43.879
<i>the fact is. I could get away
with the most outrageous behavior.</i>

605
00:41:43.879 --> 00:41:47.925
And so. I'm just trying to understand.
and say if that's-- If. you know--

606
00:41:47.925 --> 00:41:51.178
If you have specific things
that are wrong.

607
00:41:51.178 --> 00:41:53.347
let me know because. at this point.
I'm confused.

608
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:56.308
I was the "boy prince of Hollywood."

609
00:41:56.808 --> 00:42:00.145
I was big. I was bigger than bubble gum.

610
00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:02.272
You think it's made out of brick and rock.
but it's not.

611
00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:04.149
It's made out of paper and feathers.

612
00:42:05.234 --> 00:42:06.360
It's an illusion.

613
00:42:15.494 --> 00:42:16.370
Yes?

614
00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:22.543
Alex P. Keaton.
Sophomore Hospitality Committee.

615
00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:24.127
Congratulations.

616
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.675
No. Excuse me. Do you mind
if I wait around here for a while?

617
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.593
Yeah. I suppose.

618
00:42:31.593 --> 00:42:34.096
<i>That's when Tracy Pollan
came into my world.</i>

619
00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:38.934
<i>Having trained in the New York theater.</i>

620
00:42:38.934 --> 00:42:41.311
<i>Tracy brought a grounded quality
to the work.</i>

621
00:42:44.064 --> 00:42:46.441
Put that down.
Can't you see I'm painting that?

622
00:42:48.402 --> 00:42:51.613
<i>It was in stark contrast
to my "just go for the laugh" approach.</i>

623
00:42:51.613 --> 00:42:53.615
What do you call it? "Find the Apple"?

624
00:42:57.077 --> 00:42:59.371
I'd explain the concept
of abstract art to you.

625
00:42:59.371 --> 00:43:01.248
but I have a feeling
I'd be wasting my time.

626
00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:04.960
You were not the typical casting choice.

627
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.213
You were not perky.
you were not a vacuous blonde.

628
00:43:08.213 --> 00:43:10.716
- you weren't a wiseacre kind of--
- Right.

629
00:43:10.716 --> 00:43:12.801
- kind of person. You agree?
- I agree.

630
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:15.637
I was actually very surprised
to be cast on the show.

631
00:43:15.637 --> 00:43:19.141
I didn't-- I don't know if I would
have cast me on the show.

632
00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:22.186
- Why did they? What was it about you--
- Well. I think that--

633
00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:27.900
that they wanted somebody who was
very different from the character of Alex.

634
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.361
And I think that they.

635
00:43:31.945 --> 00:43:34.156
I don't know. just saw something
different in me.

636
00:43:36.491 --> 00:43:38.493
<i>One day we broke for lunch.</i>

637
00:43:39.494 --> 00:43:41.622
{\an8}Women. life. death. art.

638
00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:49.296
Places. please. Places for E.
Five. four. three...

639
00:43:49.296 --> 00:43:51.757
<i>After lunch.
we picked up where we left off.</i>

640
00:43:51.757 --> 00:43:53.884
Here we go. Ready and action.

641
00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:56.929
I got you something.

642
00:43:58.222 --> 00:43:59.139
You did?

643
00:43:59.765 --> 00:44:01.433
They were having a sale on Picassos.

644
00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:06.980
So. I got you one.

645
00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:11.693
This was very sweet of you.

646
00:44:14.488 --> 00:44:17.199
<i>The moment she said her first line.
I detected a hint of garlic</i>

647
00:44:17.199 --> 00:44:20.077
<i>and sensed an opportunity
to have a little fun at her expense.</i>

648
00:44:20.953 --> 00:44:23.080
<i>"Whoa. a little scampi for lunch. babe?"</i>

649
00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:26.166
<i>At first. she said nothing.</i>

650
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:27.876
<i>Her expression didn't even change.</i>

651
00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:31.255
<i>But looking me dead in the eye.
she said slowly.</i>

652
00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:36.802
<i>"That was mean and rude. and you're
a complete and total fucking asshole."</i>

653
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:48.397
- Hi. Ellen. Hey. are you ready to go?
- Hi. Yeah. let's go.

654
00:44:48.397 --> 00:44:49.481
Okay.

655
00:44:50.983 --> 00:44:51.900
Yeah.

656
00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:57.447
<i>Nobody talked to me that way.</i>

657
00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:02.911
<i>This woman was completely unintimidated
by whoever I thought I was.</i>

658
00:45:03.662 --> 00:45:06.582
<i>A pig is a pig no matter how many
hit movies he's just had.</i>

659
00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:11.670
So. was she right? Were you a dick?

660
00:45:13.714 --> 00:45:15.424
I was a bit of a dick.

661
00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:20.137
She was joking. but I didn't get it.

662
00:45:20.137 --> 00:45:22.347
because no one would ever joke
with me like that.

663
00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:24.141
I was not the butt of any jokes.

664
00:45:27.311 --> 00:45:29.897
And she just went.
"I'm gonna poke through that and get--

665
00:45:29.897 --> 00:45:33.358
You're
a scared little kid under this shit.

666
00:45:33.358 --> 00:45:35.611
and then I'll just call you out."

667
00:45:39.323 --> 00:45:41.617
In that moment. I fell in love with her.

668
00:45:46.788 --> 00:45:47.623
All right.

669
00:45:47.623 --> 00:45:52.920
Let me just... Right. just--

670
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.129
Right.

671
00:45:55.297 --> 00:45:57.424
All right. okay. not bad.

672
00:45:57.424 --> 00:45:58.967
Just. okay.

673
00:46:01.094 --> 00:46:03.347
All right. okay. yep. All right. Give me--

674
00:46:03.972 --> 00:46:04.973
Okay.

675
00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:07.726
There we go. Gently.

676
00:46:12.189 --> 00:46:13.190
Piece of cake.

677
00:46:17.152 --> 00:46:18.987
Alex. I've never met anybody like you.

678
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:22.199
I mean. it's like you have a way of seeing
right through me.

679
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:26.245
I'm seeing a part of me that I don't--

680
00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:28.705
I don't even like to admit exists.
and that scares me.

681
00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.674
<i>Then Tracy got a part in a film
I was about to shoot in Manhattan.</i>

682
00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:41.635
<i>We'd hang out on the set together.</i>

683
00:46:41.635 --> 00:46:43.178
So. tell me about your job.

684
00:46:43.178 --> 00:46:44.847
I guess I'm supposed to be
pretty impressed. huh?

685
00:46:44.847 --> 00:46:46.056
Don't be.

686
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:49.768
<i>She had a front-row seat
to view the whirlwind my life had become.</i>

687
00:46:49.768 --> 00:46:51.979
<i>Tracy appreciated the toll it was taking.</i>

688
00:46:53.146 --> 00:46:54.731
<i>The mistake would be to lose myself</i>

689
00:46:54.731 --> 00:46:56.859
<i>in the middle of the party
that was now my life.</i>

690
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.573
- You have my number. right?
- Right.

691
00:47:02.573 --> 00:47:03.699
You should call me.

692
00:47:04.783 --> 00:47:05.784
Yeah. I'd like to.

693
00:47:21.842 --> 00:47:24.720
- <i>I love you.</i>
- <i>I love you too.</i>

694
00:47:26.388 --> 00:47:27.389
Well...

695
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:30.017
we love each other.

696
00:47:30.517 --> 00:47:32.186
We said it. we know it.

697
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.815
I mean. that's all that's important.
It doesn't matter what happens now.

698
00:47:39.443 --> 00:47:40.485
What happens now?

699
00:47:51.663 --> 00:47:54.124
- Look at this.
- Hold it up.

700
00:47:55.834 --> 00:48:01.131
It's funny you say-- It said.
signed to Norm or Fred or something.

701
00:48:01.798 --> 00:48:06.678
Yeah. I got it at the Strand bookstore
for a dollar.

702
00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:11.517
Once we got together. I just--
I was the most in love person. I still am.

703
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.312
You need to answer. There's. like.
so many texts that you need to answer.

704
00:48:15.312 --> 00:48:17.439
- Yeah.
- You need to respond to that.

705
00:48:19.358 --> 00:48:21.276
And you need to resp-- Wait.

706
00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:22.486
It gets better.

707
00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:25.155
This is four texts from Aquinnah
that you haven't responded to.

708
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:26.365
I know. I tried to do it last night.

709
00:48:26.365 --> 00:48:28.492
- So just respond to that...
- Yeah.

710
00:48:28.492 --> 00:48:29.701
"Haven't seen you in a few days.

711
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:31.745
- love you and miss you."
- And I can't wait to see you.

712
00:48:31.745 --> 00:48:33.121
- "Can't wait to see you."
- Let me see.

713
00:48:33.121 --> 00:48:35.999
Can't wait to see you.
The beach awaits you.

714
00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:38.293
Okay.

715
00:48:40.629 --> 00:48:43.048
- "The beach awaits you"? No.
- Or something to that effect.

716
00:48:43.048 --> 00:48:44.925
Waiting for you on the beach.

717
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:46.510
I can't wait to get on the beach with--

718
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.387
can't wait to hang out
on the beach with you.

719
00:48:48.387 --> 00:48:50.389
Can't wait to hang out at the beach
with you.

720
00:48:52.432 --> 00:48:54.351
Describe this human being to me.

721
00:49:04.403 --> 00:49:05.612
Clarity.

722
00:49:05.612 --> 00:49:09.116
- "Can't wait to see you. Love you."
- Love you. That's it.

723
00:49:13.537 --> 00:49:17.374
I get a sense that she's no bullshit.

724
00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:20.377
No. No bullshit.

725
00:49:20.377 --> 00:49:23.881
Who she is is just so locked in
'cause it's so honest.

726
00:49:23.881 --> 00:49:26.633
I could be the king of England
and she would be her.

727
00:49:27.259 --> 00:49:30.596
I could be Elvis and she would be her.

728
00:49:30.596 --> 00:49:32.848
You know what. you could put
a little bit of this in there.

729
00:49:33.432 --> 00:49:36.310
- Okay. mush it now. I'll hold the bowl.
- It's really hard.

730
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.562
- It's kind of hurting my hand.
- I can't even hold the bowl.

731
00:49:40.772 --> 00:49:44.026
When I'm with my family.
there's no sentimental line with them.

732
00:49:44.026 --> 00:49:45.402
There's no "Poor baby.

733
00:49:46.653 --> 00:49:48.989
I feel your pain. I feel so bad for you.

734
00:49:48.989 --> 00:49:50.782
You're a saint among men. and"--

735
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:52.743
That would be the worst thing
they could do to me.

736
00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:54.119
- Wait. Can I just tell you--
- What?

737
00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:55.412
I was just having a conversation.

738
00:49:55.412 --> 00:49:56.788
If you look through his phone.

739
00:49:56.788 --> 00:50:00.250
it's just. like. a million texts
that are never answered.

740
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.795
Yeah. it's just me.
like. a bunch of times. like--

741
00:50:03.795 --> 00:50:05.464
- Asking questions?
- Every two weeks. I-- No.

742
00:50:05.464 --> 00:50:08.717
I'm just like. "Are you okay?
Like. sending so much love. Heart. heart."

743
00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:10.886
- And then no response. And then--
- And no response.

744
00:50:10.886 --> 00:50:12.429
But then about a week after. like.

745
00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:14.806
one of my. like.
"Love you so much. hope you're okay."

746
00:50:14.806 --> 00:50:17.351
It's this. like. really nice.
but just so random.

747
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:20.604
he said. "I hope you are happy
with all your decisions."

748
00:50:22.731 --> 00:50:24.233
Okay. thanks.

749
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.944
- It's good. Natural.
- You're a natural. Pops.

750
00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:28.654
- What are you doing?
- You should think about

751
00:50:28.654 --> 00:50:29.863
doing this for a job.

752
00:50:29.863 --> 00:50:32.324
You know. you just turned into
a fortune cookie.

753
00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:36.954
When I answer. I go to a simple.

754
00:50:36.954 --> 00:50:38.747
"Hey. I love you too. Thinking about you.
How's it going?"

755
00:50:38.747 --> 00:50:40.666
- But you don't say it.
- I know. because it comes out--

756
00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:42.334
- it comes out...
- You know. also--

757
00:50:44.253 --> 00:50:46.004
And then I go in and I'm. like--
So then I think.

758
00:50:46.004 --> 00:50:48.257
"Well this isn't working out.
I'll do the-- push the buttons."

759
00:50:48.257 --> 00:50:50.259
- Then I get some website in China.
- Yeah.

760
00:50:59.768 --> 00:51:01.311
<i>Pregnant one month after the wedding.</i>

761
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:02.813
<i>Tracy found herself with a husband...</i>

762
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:03.814
Action!

763
00:51:04.565 --> 00:51:06.191
Michael!

764
00:51:06.191 --> 00:51:08.068
<i>...who. when he wasn't away on a job.</i>

765
00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:11.572
<i>was little more than
a narcoleptic Lamaze partner.</i>

766
00:51:15.826 --> 00:51:16.952
Michael.

767
00:51:23.208 --> 00:51:25.210
This kid loves these horses.

768
00:51:30.382 --> 00:51:31.800
A vicious ride.

769
00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:46.106
How's the family? Give me
the whole report of how being a dad is.

770
00:51:46.106 --> 00:51:47.232
Being a dad is great.

771
00:51:47.232 --> 00:51:50.110
I'm sure that. you know. all the dads
out there know it's real cool.

772
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.446
He's-- My son is-- Our son.

773
00:51:53.405 --> 00:51:55.157
Boy. I didn't do half the work.

774
00:51:55.157 --> 00:51:57.534
How are you doing
balancing the family and the work?

775
00:51:57.534 --> 00:51:58.744
You're still pretty much a workaholic.

776
00:51:59.995 --> 00:52:01.830
Michael! Michael! Michael!

777
00:52:03.457 --> 00:52:05.959
<i>The rush that was my life then.
meant my bride...</i>

778
00:52:08.045 --> 00:52:10.506
<i>was wondering what in the hell
she'd gotten herself into.</i>

779
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.592
Tracy. did you miss Michael the last year?

780
00:52:13.592 --> 00:52:15.886
Yeah. It's good to have him home again.

781
00:52:15.886 --> 00:52:19.515
- She's got a tiny version of me at home.
- Yeah. I got a miniature version of him...

782
00:52:20.557 --> 00:52:21.767
<i>Inside of a year.</i>

783
00:52:21.767 --> 00:52:25.854
<i>an exquisitely talented. 20-something
actress had become a single mother...</i>

784
00:52:25.854 --> 00:52:28.690
It's about being content with who you are
and being content with your family

785
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.610
and. you know. loving yourself
and loving the people around you.

786
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:35.405
<i>...while I was still free to work.</i>

787
00:52:41.787 --> 00:52:44.873
<i>Here I was. shooting my fifth film
in less than three years.</i>

788
00:52:46.917 --> 00:52:48.752
<i>But it was a sheltered. narrow existence.</i>

789
00:52:48.752 --> 00:52:50.504
<i>He's a chickenshit. man.</i>

790
00:52:51.755 --> 00:52:53.757
<i>Fueled by fear and isolation.</i>

791
00:52:56.969 --> 00:53:00.389
<i>Actors don't become actors because
they're brimming with self-confidence.</i>

792
00:53:00.389 --> 00:53:02.057
Hey. good morning. Mr. Eastwood.

793
00:53:02.641 --> 00:53:05.727
<i>An actor's burning ambition
is to spend as much time as possible</i>

794
00:53:05.727 --> 00:53:07.396
<i>pretending to be somebody else.</i>

795
00:53:08.021 --> 00:53:10.899
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless yellow turd!

796
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:15.904
<i>For those of us lucky or unstable
enough to become professional performers...</i>

797
00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:17.531
Who the hell do you think you are?

798
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:20.576
<i>...the uncertainty about who we really are
only increases.</i>

799
00:53:21.076 --> 00:53:22.494
And you.

800
00:53:22.494 --> 00:53:23.620
<i>Gnawing at you always...</i>

801
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.414
You I don't know about.

802
00:53:25.414 --> 00:53:28.959
<i>...is the belief that you're a fake.
A phony.</i>

803
00:53:30.252 --> 00:53:31.837
I hate your movies.

804
00:53:35.257 --> 00:53:37.384
<i>What is a typical.
if there is such a thing.</i>

805
00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:40.262
<i>day in the life of
Michael and Tracy and Sam?</i>

806
00:53:40.262 --> 00:53:42.973
<i>I get up and go to work.
I come home and everybody is asleep.</i>

807
00:53:43.932 --> 00:53:44.975
<i>That's about it.</i>

808
00:53:53.358 --> 00:53:55.986
<i>Dad hadn't been feeling well

809

"My father had been rushed
to the hospital.

Dad hadn't been feeling well
for the last month or so.

811
00:54:14.505 --> 00:54:17.966
His heart gave out first.
then his kidneys began to fail.

812
00:54:19.885 --> 00:54:25.098
I couldn't know that day in 1990
that I was stepping across a threshold."

813
00:54:26.558 --> 00:54:27.559
Sorry.

814
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.485
Stuff like that just hits you like a--
You're going through this stuff and you--

815
00:54:36.485 --> 00:54:39.154
Something like that pops out
and you're so. like--

816
00:54:40.739 --> 00:54:44.826
like that's three sentences
and. like. 10.000 pounds of stuff.

817
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.542
What was the threshold?

818
00:54:53.043 --> 00:54:55.963
Threshold was adulthood. Like. real shit.

819
00:55:01.593 --> 00:55:02.719
Life.

820
00:55:10.435 --> 00:55:13.397
<i>For Christ's sake. Mike.
It's just your freaking finger.</i>

821
00:55:14.064 --> 00:55:15.232
<i>But that was the problem.</i>

822
00:55:15.858 --> 00:55:18.652
<i>It wasn't mine. It was somebody else's.</i>

823
00:55:46.138 --> 00:55:48.849
<i>The most paranoid fantasy I could
think of would not have prepared me</i>

824
00:55:48.849 --> 00:55:52.019
<i>for the two words the neurologist
bludgeoned me with that day.</i>

825
00:55:55.147 --> 00:55:56.440
<i>Parkinson's disease.</i>

826
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.072
And I said.
"You know who you're talking to. right?

827
00:56:04.573 --> 00:56:09.745
You know. I'm. like. not someone
who is supposed to get this."

828
00:56:12.956 --> 00:56:14.583
<i>He handed me a pamphlet.</i>

829
00:56:16.168 --> 00:56:19.755
<i>Which one had the incurable brain disease
was not clear. they both looked happy.</i>

830
00:56:22.674 --> 00:56:26.762
<i>He said some more words like.
"progressive." "degenerative."</i>

831
00:56:28.055 --> 00:56:29.056
<i>"incurable."</i>

832
00:56:30.766 --> 00:56:34.603
He said. "You lose this game.
You don't win this."

833
00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:48.492
I remember standing on the street looking
for an answer.

834
00:56:50.494 --> 00:56:52.704
It's just-- I just-- My world blew up.

835
00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:57.876
<i>I should have seen it coming.</i>

836
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:01.630
<i>the cosmic price I had to pay
for all my success.</i>

837
00:57:05.217 --> 00:57:06.844
<i>I told Tracy the news.</i>

838
00:57:11.682 --> 00:57:14.101
<i>"In sickness and in health."
I remember her whispering.</i>

839
00:57:23.777 --> 00:57:25.904
Now totally relax with the head.

840
00:57:27.197 --> 00:57:30.284
Okay. that's good. Yeah.
Now. look at my finger. Open up.

841
00:57:30.284 --> 00:57:31.368
Look over here.

842
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:34.872
Yeah. Up. That's good.

843
00:57:37.416 --> 00:57:38.417
Go like this.

844
00:57:39.376 --> 00:57:40.752
You're good. Excellent.

845
00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:43.088
- Actually. that's very strong. Hold on.
- I'm a strong man.

846
00:57:43.088 --> 00:57:45.215
- You're a strong man.
- Very strong.

847
00:57:45.215 --> 00:57:47.426
So. you were getting dressed.
you were in a hurry.

848
00:57:47.426 --> 00:57:49.386
you went smack into the headboard?

849
00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:51.096
- Headboard. Yeah.
- Okay.

850
00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:54.433
So. when did you dislocate the shoulder?

851
00:57:54.433 --> 00:57:56.059
- Around the same time?
- Around the same time.

852
00:57:56.059 --> 00:57:59.104
It all happened in the--
It was like a festival of self-abuse.

853
00:57:59.104 --> 00:58:01.273
- You can do a tour of my house.
- Okay.

854
00:58:01.273 --> 00:58:03.483
- It's almost all in the same spot.
- What's it matter?

855
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:05.235
Okay. so squeeze my hand.

856
00:58:05.235 --> 00:58:06.862
- How does that feel?
- Feels all right.

857
00:58:06.862 --> 00:58:07.988
I think we're gonna be fine.

858
00:58:07.988 --> 00:58:09.364
- You're gonna be fine?
- Yeah.

859
00:58:09.364 --> 00:58:11.033
They're not gonna have to
amputate anything or--

860
00:58:11.033 --> 00:58:12.492
- No. My head.
- Okay. Good.

861
00:58:12.492 --> 00:58:13.994
- Your head?
- My head. yeah.

862
00:58:15.454 --> 00:58:16.371
Okay.

863
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:18.248
Tracy's the smartest person I know.

864
00:58:18.749 --> 00:58:20.834
She's learned to deal with a lot of stuff.

865
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:23.837
How frustrating it must be
to have to bear the burden

866
00:58:23.837 --> 00:58:25.589
of something that isn't her burden.

867
00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:28.175
It's my burden. but she shares it with me.

868
00:58:28.175 --> 00:58:30.886
She not only shares it with me.
she takes on more than I take on.

869
00:58:30.886 --> 00:58:34.097
So. you take the first round
while you're still in bed?

870
00:58:34.097 --> 00:58:35.891
- No. out of bed.
- Out of bed. Okay.

871
00:58:36.642 --> 00:58:39.394
- Sometimes Michael likes to hold that off...
- Yeah.

872
00:58:39.394 --> 00:58:41.647
...if he's got something
that he needs to do.

873
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:46.068
He thinks if he waits.
it's gonna kick in stronger and better.

874
00:58:46.568 --> 00:58:48.362
Everything I go through.
she's gone through.

875
00:58:48.362 --> 00:58:51.073
And then I have to try to figure out
how to make it work.

876
00:58:51.573 --> 00:58:54.076
Like. I just have to feel it
and then-- and live it.

877
00:58:55.869 --> 00:58:57.704
I can walk a little bit though. Like that.

878
00:58:58.622 --> 00:59:00.165
She has to make it work.

879
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:02.334
- I'm walking. honey.
- You are.

880
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.463
- Good job.
- I know.

881
00:59:06.463 --> 00:59:08.507
- Is that this way?
- Yeah.

882
00:59:13.053 --> 00:59:14.513
Slow down a little. Okay.

883
00:59:25.858 --> 00:59:27.526
<i>I clung to fantasies of escape.</i>

884
00:59:31.446 --> 00:59:33.824
<i>That somehow my diagnosis
would turn out to be a mistake.</i>

885
00:59:38.412 --> 00:59:40.205
<i>I was in my late 20s.</i>

886
00:59:40.998 --> 00:59:44.209
<i>How could I possibly
have this old person's disease?</i>

887
00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:48.130
<i>Symptoms include muscular rigidity.</i>

888
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.549
<i>slowness and poverty of
movements and tremor.</i>

889
00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:55.512
<i>diminished blinking. and reduced
spontaneity of facial expression.</i>

890
00:59:58.682 --> 01:00:02.561
<i>I thought my diminished blinking and
reduced spontaneity of facial expression</i>

891
01:00:02.561 --> 01:00:04.771
<i>marked a growing comfort
in front of the camera.</i>

892
01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.398
<i>Less mugging. hamming it up.</i>

893
01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:10.485
<i>No. you weren't getting better.
Just sicker.</i>

894
01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:15.199
What advice would you give to someone
that has the disease?

895
01:00:15.199 --> 01:00:18.702
The main thing is. is to be truthful.
first. with yourself.

896
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:22.831
Here's Johnny.

897
01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:42.184
<i>With no obvious cue. my left hand
would begin shaking uncontrollably.</i>

898
01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:46.230
<i>Now. anyway. let's move.
We've got a great show tonight.</i>

899
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.856
<i>Mr. Michael J. Fox is with us.</i>

900
01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:52.361
<i>I had my internist prescribe PD meds.</i>

901
01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:59.034
<i>Sinemet is taken up by the brain
and changed into dopamine.</i>

902
01:00:59.785 --> 01:01:02.746
<i>the neurotransmitter that a Parkinson's
patient can no longer produce</i>

903
01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:03.997
<i>in sufficient quantities.</i>

904
01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:07.209
Anyway.
I'm glad Michael Fox is here tonight.

905
01:01:07.209 --> 01:01:09.211
He's a most-talented young man. and--

906
01:01:11.964 --> 01:01:13.423
Would you welcome Michael J. Fox?

907
01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.639
<i>Therapeutic value. even comfort.</i>

908
01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:22.891
<i>none of these was the reason
I took these pills.</i>

909
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.893
<i>There was only one reason.</i>

910
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:27.855
Yeah.

911
01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:28.772
<i>To hide.</i>

912
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.112
<i>I carried the pills around
loose and broken</i>

913
01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:37.322
<i>in the pockets of my shirts and trousers.</i>

914
01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:41.493
<i>Like Halloween Smarties.</i>

915
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:51.003
<i>Parkinsonian tremor occurs
when the affected limb is at rest.</i>

916
01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:55.883
<i>I was able to mask the trembling
by twiddling an object in my left hand.</i>

917
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.096
<i>Day after day. for hours on end.</i>

918
01:02:02.264 --> 01:02:03.932
Uh-huh. Uh-huh...

919
01:02:07.186 --> 01:02:08.520
Sir. I can't hear you.

920
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.064
There's some kind of a ruckus outside.

921
01:02:11.857 --> 01:02:13.150
Can I call you back?

922
01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:17.112
<i>I never gave a second's thought
to sharing my diagnosis with anyone.</i>

923
01:02:17.988 --> 01:02:18.864
<i>I had work to do.</i>

924
01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:24.077
<i>And I intended to pretend as if
none of this was actually happening to me.</i>

925
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:27.748
You can't do this to people.

926
01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:31.835
You can't lie and fake and manipulate.
I won't accept that.

927
01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:39.218
Just this once.
I'm gonna let you off with a warning.

928
01:02:42.471 --> 01:02:46.099
I like guys that are a little too smart
for their own good.

929
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.144
You know. master manipulators who think
they're manipulating everybody else.

930
01:02:50.812 --> 01:02:52.898
but are. in a way.
kind of manipulating themselves

931
01:02:52.898 --> 01:02:54.733
into a situation they can't control.

932
01:02:57.027 --> 01:02:59.738
<i>I became a virtuoso
at manipulating drug intake...</i>

933
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.080
<i>so that I'd peak
at exactly the right time and place.</i>

934
01:03:16.088 --> 01:03:17.089
I need more pills.

935
01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:20.926
You wanna take a break?

936
01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:26.181
Well. I mean. I should've stopped
ten minutes ago 'cause I need more pills.

937
01:03:30.644 --> 01:03:32.521
- It'll just take two minutes.
- Yeah.

938
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.735
You take the pill. then you're waiting.
And what does it feel like?

939
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.907
Like waiting-- I always say
waiting for a bus. Waiting for the bus.

940
01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:46.034
People will say. "What are you doing?"
I say. "I'm waiting for the bus."

941
01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:47.286
And they know what I mean.

942
01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:54.084
Yeah. it's kicking in now. It's nice.

943
01:03:54.084 --> 01:03:56.170
Today's a quick-- Quick kick-in today.

944
01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:00.883
I'm a little-- still a little mumble
mouth. but I feel good.

945
01:04:00.883 --> 01:04:02.593
I feel still.

946
01:04:02.593 --> 01:04:04.636
So. you're still waiting
for the bus. or you're on the bus?

947
01:04:04.636 --> 01:04:07.097
No. I'm on the bus.
I'm putting in-- money in the thing.

948
01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:14.354
It's a great release. It's just. like.
you pour into the form that is you.

949
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:18.400
That you-- It gets filled with you again.

950
01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:21.445
Rolling. rolling.

951
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:23.030
Speed.

952
01:04:25.324 --> 01:04:26.366
<i>My body ached.</i>

953
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:28.202
Playback.

954
01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:32.331
<i>I had been contorting it
into intensely uncomfortable positions</i>

955
01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:34.208
<i>in order to mask the tremors.</i>

956
01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:35.417
Okay. marker.

957
01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:43.842
Okay. play again.

958
01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:48.597
I see "R-E-C."

959
01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:51.850
Yeah. that's "record."

960
01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:53.602
<i>My appetite was nonexistent.</i>

961
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.231
<i>And I used that excuse
to avoid joining my family for dinner.</i>

962
01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:03.695
<i>I thought that by thinking about
Parkinson's. I was hastening its arrival.</i>

963
01:05:13.205 --> 01:05:14.748
<i>Instead. I drank to disassociate.</i>

964
01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:18.961
<i>To escape my situation.</i>

965
01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:25.342
Parkinson's. it was hide-the-bottle time.

966
01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:27.177
It was--
Like. I had bottles stashed in the garage.

967
01:05:27.177 --> 01:05:29.555
and I'd open two bottles of wine.

968
01:05:29.555 --> 01:05:32.558
and Tracy would think we just drank one.
she didn't know I drank the other one.

969
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:39.231
And I started to have a margarita
before the last take.

970
01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:40.524
Jack Daniel's. rocks. please.

971
01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:44.611
{\an8}For Love or Money<i>. with Michael J. Fox.
starts out great</i>

972
01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:46.989
{\an8}<i>and then gets all soft.
Regretfully though. thumbs-down.</i>

973
01:05:46.989 --> 01:05:49.867
<i>With me. it isn't even a close call.
It's definitely thumbs-down.</i>

974
01:05:50.993 --> 01:05:52.244
And then things started to slip.

975
01:05:55.998 --> 01:05:58.292
Life with Mikey
<i>doesn't tell much of a story.</i>

976
01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:01.420
<i>I sat there wondering why Michael J. Fox
seemed to be without a clue</i>

977
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.130
<i>in a lot of his big scenes.</i>

978
01:06:05.424 --> 01:06:07.759
<i>And here's another movie
that loses its way.</i>

979
01:06:07.759 --> 01:06:08.969
Greedy.

980
01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:10.762
<i>Michael J. Fox fell for that old trap.</i>

981
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:14.183
{\an8}<i>They wanna play characters
who are really likable.</i>

982
01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:15.767
{\an8}- <i>Why not play nasty?</i>
- <i>I agree. Yeah.</i>

983
01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:19.062
<i>Make 'em hateful. People love you
when you play hateful characters.</i>

984
01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:20.480
Nicky!

985
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.774
It's crap. Angie. It's crap.

986
01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:24.568
It's another big-budget. big-box-office.

987
01:06:24.568 --> 01:06:27.529
in-one-end. out-the-other.
easy-to-flush piece of crap.

988
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:29.656
I was sullen and angry.

989
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:32.910
There was one thing in a store.
This guy stepped in front of me.

990
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.204
And I said.
"Excuse me. What am I. fucking invisible?"

991
01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:36.872
And he goes. "Yeah. you're invisible."

992
01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:39.458
And I grabbed his shirt.
and I said. "Fuck you. man.

993
01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:41.293
I'll take you outside
and take your head off."

994
01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:45.380
And I said. "I'd love nothing more.
today. than to take your head off."

995
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.883
And he just backed off. and they all
went white and they walked out.

996
01:06:47.883 --> 01:06:49.384
I said. "I can be that guy."

997
01:06:52.012 --> 01:06:54.389
I didn't know what was happening.
I didn't know what was coming.

998
01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:59.269
So. what if I could just
have four glasses of wine

999
01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:01.772
and maybe a shot?

1000
01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:05.317
- So. were you an alcoholic?
- Yeah. I was definitely an alcoholic.

1001
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:12.074
But I've gone 30 years
without having a drink.

1002
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:16.662
What is the core of that behavior?

1003
01:07:17.287 --> 01:07:18.497
The core of that behavior is fear.

1004
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.546
<i>There was an urgency. an edge.
to that night's partying.</i>

1005
01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:29.591
<i>We were on our third pitcher of margaritas
by the time the director called "Wrap."</i>

1006
01:07:41.728 --> 01:07:44.022
Oh. God.

1007
01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:49.570
<i>I saw feet. Tracy's feet.</i>

1008
01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.531
<i>The feet had on shoes.
Shit. What time was it?</i>

1009
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:57.619
<i>I found no expression of rage.</i>

1010
01:07:58.412 --> 01:08:00.831
<i>She was meeting my sorry state
with indifference.</i>

1011
01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:05.794
<i>"Is this what you want?" she said.</i>

1012
01:08:07.296 --> 01:08:08.714
<i>"This is what you wanna be?"</i>

1013
01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:14.595
Okay. Michael. Tracy.
turn your head. please.

1014
01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:18.182
<i>I'd never been so frightened in my life.</i>

1015
01:08:18.182 --> 01:08:21.894
Tracy. Tracy!

1016
01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.147
Tracy!

1017
01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:38.285
<i>The bathtub became my refuge.</i>

1018
01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:43.332
<i>Day after day. for hours at a time.</i>

1019
01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.462
I just wanted to keep my head below water.

1020
01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:51.173
I needed to suffer.
I needed to go as low as I could go.

1021
01:08:59.096 --> 01:09:02.309
<i>All I could hear
was the muted splash of my trembling hand.</i>

1022
01:09:06.104 --> 01:09:08.148
<i>But as low as alcohol had brought me.</i>

1023
01:09:09.816 --> 01:09:11.484
<i>abstinence would bring me lower.</i>

1024
01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:19.201
<i>I could no longer escape myself.</i>

1025
01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:26.542
My first few years of sobriety
were like a knife fight in a closet.

1026
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.627
What's the knife?

1027
01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:32.339
The truth.

1028
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.885
Truth. I wasn't facing things.

1029
01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:46.395
I just wanted to be out of the world.

1030
01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:50.649
And I wanted to be in another place.
doing another thing.

1031
01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:01.827
I ran away and did movies
in other parts of the world.

1032
01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:06.415
Can't pretend at home
that you don't have Parkinson's...

1033
01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:10.961
because you're just there with it.

1034
01:10:12.004 --> 01:10:14.006
If I'm out in the world.
and I'm dealing with other people...

1035
01:10:16.425 --> 01:10:19.553
and they don't know I have it.
then I don't have it.

1036
01:10:21.722 --> 01:10:23.891
But Tracy was really having a hard time

1037
01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:26.185
and really was
getting to the end of her rope.

1038
01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:34.026
{\an8}Because now we had twins.

1039
01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:38.697
{\an8}Aquinnah and Schuyler.

1040
01:10:41.366 --> 01:10:42.868
{\an8}And I get back to my family.

1041
01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:45.746
Sam was happy I was home. but mad at me.

1042
01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:49.958
{\an8}Mom. I'm gonna try...

1043
01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:51.168
{\an8}It's time.

1044
01:10:53.587 --> 01:10:54.588
{\an8}So. what do I do?

1045
01:10:57.799 --> 01:10:59.801
{\an8}- Left turn.
- I think it's wobbling.

1046
01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:02.513
{\an8}You got it though. You got it. You own it.

1047
01:11:02.513 --> 01:11:05.682
{\an8}You're on it. You're on it. Go. go. go.
Keep going. Go. go. go.

1048
01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:06.934
{\an8}<i>I made up my mind.</i>

1049
01:11:17.569 --> 01:11:18.904
<i>I was going home to television.</i>

1050
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.867
And I thought. "Yeah. there's nothing like
to walk out into a set

1051
01:11:23.867 --> 01:11:26.578
and drop a line
and have them go fucking crazy."

1052
01:11:26.578 --> 01:11:30.165
I just figured. since the <i>Daily News</i>
says we were seen eating dinner.

1053
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.542
we might as well do it.

1054
01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:34.962
You know. the <i>Post</i>
says we're sleeping together.

1055
01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:38.966
- Did you get the last approval ratings?
- Right here. Mike.

1056
01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:43.595
<i>The reviews were terrific.
and ratings suggested long-term success.</i>

1057
01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:50.853
{\an8}<i>With schedules that meshed perfectly
with the rhythms of my family.</i>

1058
01:11:50.853 --> 01:11:52.104
{\an8}Schuyler. walk to me.

1059
01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:59.069
<i>And the situation was near perfect.</i>

1060
01:11:59.069 --> 01:12:00.988
It's called "Spin." Power of persuasion.

1061
01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:03.115
Making people believe
what I want them to believe.

1062
01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:04.741
It's what I do. It is my gift.

1063
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:05.868
You were amazing.

1064
01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:07.661
Yeah. no problem.

1065
01:12:07.661 --> 01:12:10.831
It was fun pretending.

1066
01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:17.880
All right. the mayor prepared
to speak about the strike?

1067
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.922
I worked on it all night. Mike.

1068
01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:22.968
All right. sir.
We're going on earlier than we thought.

1069
01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:31.643
<i>The stress with doing a weekly show
in front of a studio audience</i>

1070
01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.771
<i>was exacerbating my symptoms.</i>

1071
01:12:35.814 --> 01:12:37.983
<i>The whole of my left arm
would be tremoring.</i>

1072
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:41.403
<i>forceful enough to shake my entire body.</i>

1073
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.948
It would just twist you.

1074
01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:46.867
Then I'd lie on the floor
twisting and waiting.

1075
01:12:46.867 --> 01:12:49.203
and I'd have an audience outside
waiting for me to go do a scene.

1076
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:55.667
I could not only hear
their feet shuffling. I could feel them.

1077
01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:02.216
Please. join us.

1078
01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:04.426
<i>All the while. I was doing the math.</i>

1079
01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:08.597
<i>How long since the last pill?
How long until it wears off?</i>

1080
01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:11.475
<i>If the warning came</i>

1081
01:13:11.475 --> 01:13:13.852
<i>when I was in the middle of
a four- to five-minute scene.</i>

1082
01:13:14.353 --> 01:13:17.481
<i>there wasn't anything I could do
to stave off the return of my symptoms.</i>

1083
01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:24.321
Fred. Joe.
pleasure to see you guys. as always.

1084
01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:25.280
I was just thinking...

1085
01:13:29.368 --> 01:13:32.246
<i>And still.
no one outside of my family knew.</i>

1086
01:13:34.873 --> 01:13:36.333
I'm living a lie.

1087
01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:40.295
Can't go on with this.
This has gotta stop.

1088
01:13:44.675 --> 01:13:48.136
You start to feel people looking at you.

1089
01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:51.265
staring. judging.

1090
01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:55.561
gazing into the very recesses
of your soul.

1091
01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:59.857
- Yeah. speed.
- Roll cameras.

1092
01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:11.910
We're ready. Michael.

1093
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:13.871
- Wait. how's that?
- Good.

1094
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:14.955
Here we go.

1095
01:14:30.637 --> 01:14:33.182
To me. the worst thing is restraint.

1096
01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:38.687
and the worst thing is to be confined
and not be able to have a way out.

1097
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.690
And there were times when I went.
"There's no way out of this."

1098
01:14:48.864 --> 01:14:51.325
<i>I'd spruce up the walls
with fist-sized holes.</i>

1099
01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:11.762
<i>You're only as sick as your secrets.</i>

1100
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:19.228
If you feel comfortable.
you can let go of the bar.

1101
01:15:19.228 --> 01:15:22.898
If you don't. try and keep the pressure
off that right hand.

1102
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:25.150
Good. I'm here.

1103
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:28.278
Good. Move your right foot
to the right a little bit.

1104
01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.239
Even more. There you go.

1105
01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:31.323
So. what happened?

1106
01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:32.491
Let's see if you can stay here.

1107
01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:33.909
I fucking hurt myself again.

1108
01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:39.164
I tripped over a carpet.
and I broke my hand.

1109
01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:40.832
and I had pins put in my hand.

1110
01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:43.836
But the area around the pins got infected.

1111
01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:46.421
and then there was the option of
just taking my finger off.

1112
01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:50.926
And then I broke my arm.

1113
01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:55.389
And the people around me were going.
"You gotta be careful."

1114
01:15:55.389 --> 01:15:57.057
I said. "This has nothing to do with
being careful.

1115
01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:58.392
This is just. like-- This happens.

1116
01:15:58.392 --> 01:16:01.019
You have Parkinson's. you trip over shit.
and you fall down."

1117
01:16:01.979 --> 01:16:04.064
Try and lift your chest
just a little bit more.

1118
01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:05.148
There you go.

1119
01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:12.406
- Nice job. Do you--
- Don't put Mikey in a corner.

1120
01:16:14.408 --> 01:16:19.079
When I find you
talking about the shitty stuff.

1121
01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:22.165
I see you sort of get close to it
and then dart away.

1122
01:16:27.504 --> 01:16:29.298
Careful with this right hand.

1123
01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:30.382
Yeah. Oh. yeah.

1124
01:16:30.966 --> 01:16:32.467
- Good. Have a seat.
- I'm okay.

1125
01:16:32.467 --> 01:16:33.844
- You want-- You sure?
- Yeah.

1126
01:16:36.346 --> 01:16:38.724
- This is where I can't use my--
- Right.

1127
01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:42.311
See. the core is still there.
Those are obliques.

1128
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.062
- Yeah.
- Right. How you feeling?

1129
01:16:45.105 --> 01:16:46.106
Okay.

1130
01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:49.109
I've interviewed you
for hours and hours and hours.

1131
01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:51.278
You've never told me once. "I'm in pain."

1132
01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:55.866
- I'm in pain.
- You are?

1133
01:16:55.866 --> 01:16:57.951
I'm in intense pain.

1134
01:16:58.952 --> 01:17:03.207
Five. four. three. two. one. And relax.

1135
01:17:03.207 --> 01:17:05.709
- That's making it really hurt.
- The shoulder? Here?

1136
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:09.254
Every tremor is like a seismic jolt.

1137
01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.006
- Do you wanna sit upright?
- Yeah. I do.

1138
01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:12.382
Do you wanna sit in the chair?

1139
01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:14.593
- Anything but what I'm doing right now.
- Okay.

1140
01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:16.470
But why wouldn't you tell me--

1141
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:18.430
- This is about us talking...
- Well. it didn't come up.

1142
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:20.349
...and telling the truth.
Why wouldn't you tell me about your pain?

1143
01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:22.893
It didn't come up.
I'm not gonna lead with it.

1144
01:17:27.356 --> 01:17:28.524
Good. Don't plop.

1145
01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:31.235
No jolts. Good.

1146
01:17:33.195 --> 01:17:34.196
I'm okay.

1147
01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:37.824
- I just wanna feel better.
- Yeah.

1148
01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:40.327
And it seems to me I can see clearly--

1149
01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:42.871
more clearly the things I need to do
to feel better.

1150
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.999
But it's this Michael J. Fox stuff.

1151
01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.877
People express to me
that I make them feel better.

1152
01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:51.213
I make them do things
they might not otherwise do.

1153
01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:54.174
And that's the most powerful thing
you could ever feel.

1154
01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:55.926
and that's a huge responsibility.

1155
01:17:56.468 --> 01:17:58.428
- And I don't want to fuck it up.
- Right.

1156
01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:05.644
It's okay not to be
Michael J. Fox sometimes.

1157
01:18:18.615 --> 01:18:21.702
<i>Michael J. Fox
kept something very private.</i>

1158
01:18:23.453 --> 01:18:25.205
<i>Something about his health.</i>

1159
01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:29.459
<i>Now he's gone public with the fact
that he has Parkinson's disease.</i>

1160
01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:32.087
<i>Michael J. Fox.
one of America's best-loved actors</i>

1161
01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:35.007
<i>has decided to publicly announce that
he's been battling Parkinson's disease.</i>

1162
01:18:35.007 --> 01:18:37.176
<i>...shocked the
entertainment world when he announced</i>

1163
01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:39.261
<i>he has been battling Parkinson's disease.</i>

1164
01:18:39.261 --> 01:18:41.346
<i>...and has had it for seven years.</i>

1165
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:45.267
Michael.
all this week we have been hearing

1166
01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:47.603
that you have this devastating disease.

1167
01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:51.315
that it is life-threatening.
that you are in the fight for your life.

1168
01:18:52.232 --> 01:18:53.901
Do you feel relieved now?

1169
01:18:54.484 --> 01:18:56.236
<i>Oh. my God. What have I done?</i>

1170
01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.781
<i>What is his prognosis?</i>

1171
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.034
<i>Within ten years.
he will have serious disabilities.</i>

1172
01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:04.703
<i>Balance problems with frequent falls.</i>

1173
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.497
<i>I think he's got
a tough road ahead of him.</i>

1174
01:19:10.125 --> 01:19:11.543
Are you at all concerned

1175
01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:13.837
that now audiences
will look at you differently?

1176
01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.677
<i>This will be my first time
in front of a studio audience</i>

1177
01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:22.346
<i>since I disclosed my diagnosis.</i>

1178
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.810
My fear was that they would reject me.
and that they would not understand it.

1179
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:31.939
that because I was sick.
I couldn't be funny.

1180
01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:36.902
And I had to hope
that they could accept me.

1181
01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.155
- We got speed.
- Roll cameras.

1182
01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:41.907
- Mark.
- And action.

1183
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.580
We meet again. Mr. Bond.

1184
01:19:58.090 --> 01:19:59.091
There.

1185
01:20:00.217 --> 01:20:01.677
Deal with that. Bobo Fischer.

1186
01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:16.984
I knew that.

1187
01:20:20.487 --> 01:20:21.947
That's a bold move.

1188
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.202
And I got this huge reaction.

1189
01:20:28.036 --> 01:20:30.998
You have chosen poorly.

1190
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.004
Checkmate.

1191
01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:39.590
Like. that's love that can't help itself.

1192
01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:52.019
Do you feel like you have a 90-year-old
like. dad. or...

1193
01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:55.606
'Cause I don't feel like 90 years old.
but I-- Well. you sometimes get mad at me.

1194
01:20:55.606 --> 01:20:57.441
Like. you guys all say.
"Be careful. be careful."

1195
01:20:57.441 --> 01:21:00.777
I say that I'm being careful. Like.
what. do I set out to not be careful?

1196
01:21:00.777 --> 01:21:03.488
Nobody thinks your agenda
isn't to be careful.

1197
01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:06.200
It's that that maybe isn't--

1198
01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:08.493
The first thing--

1199
01:21:08.493 --> 01:21:10.787
It's lower on the list of things
than it is for us.

1200
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:12.372
So--

1201
01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:16.251
So I just have to make sure. you know?
And I'd rather--

1202
01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:18.462
It's great if you understand
what I'm saying.

1203
01:21:18.462 --> 01:21:19.963
but I'd rather you don't fall over.

1204
01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:21.423
- I'm working on it.
- Yeah.

1205
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.428
I can look at myself. and I say.
"I have Parkinson's."

1206
01:21:27.095 --> 01:21:28.597
So. how do I wanna live with that?

1207
01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:32.434
But if I never get past the
"I have Parkinson's" part.

1208
01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:34.520
if I never get past the part
where I wake up in the morning

1209
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.480
and I go. "Yeah. that's real.
That's happening."

1210
01:21:37.105 --> 01:21:38.607
then I can't get past it.

1211
01:21:38.607 --> 01:21:41.443
You know. this is the first time
that I've had a chance to talk with--

1212
01:21:41.443 --> 01:21:44.071
the first time you've been on the show
since you had your press conference

1213
01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:45.405
- and announced that you...
- Right.

1214
01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:46.532
...have Parkinson's disease.

1215
01:21:46.532 --> 01:21:48.033
- And I just-- I think folks...
- Yeah.

1216
01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:50.118
...well. you know--
How's it been going since?

1217
01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:51.286
What was the reaction
of that announcement?

1218
01:21:51.286 --> 01:21:53.121
Pretty much the same. It didn't change.

1219
01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:54.831
- I still have it. So...
- Yeah?

1220
01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:02.464
<i>After all those years of
hiding my symptoms. I could let it go.</i>

1221
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:09.137
I suffer from a condition.
and it makes me do this.

1222
01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:11.765
and this. and...

1223
01:22:13.851 --> 01:22:15.227
Uh-oh.

1224
01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:17.938
If you just look at me long enough.
you get used to it.

1225
01:22:17.938 --> 01:22:21.733
I realized I didn't have to
do anything other than be myself.

1226
01:22:21.733 --> 01:22:23.735
Sometimes when I take
a little bit too much medication.

1227
01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:26.238
I get that kind of swaying thing.
I do the kind of Axl Rose thing.

1228
01:22:27.865 --> 01:22:31.577
So. if you see that. you know. just kind
of hum "Paradise City" in your mind.

1229
01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:37.624
<i>I was still me. people recognized.
Just me plus Parkinson's.</i>

1230
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:41.170
Oh. Jesus Christ.

1231
01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:42.838
- What the hell?
- You want?

1232
01:22:44.298 --> 01:22:46.008
Did you shake that up on purpose?

1233
01:22:46.925 --> 01:22:47.759
Parkinson's.

1234
01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:52.598
<i>Some people would view the news of
my disease as an ending.</i>

1235
01:22:53.599 --> 01:22:56.518
<i>But I was starting to sense that
it was really a beginning.</i>

1236
01:22:57.102 --> 01:22:59.521
<i>Actor Michael J. Fox
testified before Congress.</i>

1237
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.983
<i>asking for an increase in research funding
for Parkinson's disease.</i>

1238
01:23:04.276 --> 01:23:08.155
"I'm here to tell you that administering
a successful research program

1239
01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:09.448
is not rocket science.

1240
01:23:09.948 --> 01:23:13.619
It's mostly common sense and the will
to get things done. Thank you."

1241
01:23:14.161 --> 01:23:15.454
Good stuff. Michael.

1242
01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:18.624
I never actually said this to anybody.

1243
01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:20.000
but I always fantasized saying it.

1244
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.753
"Yeah. you're bigger than me.
You'll beat me up.

1245
01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:26.089
But I'll hit you once. and you'll hurt."

1246
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.511
And I knew that moment.

1247
01:23:34.932 --> 01:23:38.477
<i>Muhammad Ali and
Michael J. Fox joining a chorus of voices</i>

1248
01:23:38.477 --> 01:23:40.354
<i>saying money is desperately needed.</i>

1249
01:23:41.355 --> 01:23:45.025
I wanted to be in the world and not
take this and retreat from the world.

1250
01:23:45.734 --> 01:23:47.694
It made me realize
what I still have to give.

1251
01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:51.448
Find it extremely moving--
no pun intended--

1252
01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:53.367
to be here today and reach out...

01:24:15.722 --> 01:24:17.891
Go see Daddy. Go give Daddy a kiss.

1258
01:24:18.559 --> 01:24:20.435
- Look at Dad.
- What's Daddy doing?

1259
01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:21.603
Look at Daddy. Esmé.

1260
01:24:21.603 --> 01:24:22.771
The kids are the best.

1261
01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:25.607
because kids will just say.
"Will you stop moving around?"

1262
01:24:31.154 --> 01:24:32.155
I'm sure.

1263
01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:34.950
I say. "I'll give it a shot. hon."

1264
01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:43.083
- No.
- In love.

1265
01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.085
- No. They're...
- They're flying.

- They're dancing.
- Okay. good.

01:24:47.379 --> 01:24:49.548
- Would you guys like to switch teams...
- But what--

1268
01:24:49.548 --> 01:24:52.092
...because we've been winning.
or do you wanna keep the same teams?

1269
01:24:52.092 --> 01:24:54.178
I like the teams we're on. but...

1270
01:24:54.178 --> 01:24:56.221
- I'm tragic at this game.
- It's not her fault. It's my fault.

1271
01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:57.639
But I was thinking-- Yeah.

1272
01:24:57.639 --> 01:24:58.557
Do you see it?

1273
01:24:58.557 --> 01:25:00.184
- Oh. yeah.
- You got it?

1274
01:25:02.895 --> 01:25:03.812
You.

1275
01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:05.814
- You got it already?
- Yeah.

1276
01:25:05.814 --> 01:25:07.024
I just had me.

1277
01:25:07.649 --> 01:25:08.817
It was me?

1278
01:25:08.817 --> 01:25:10.110
It was me. not you.

He thinks it was "Michael J. Fox."

1280
01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:18.243
The thing about motion with me is.
I've always been moving.

1281
01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:19.912
and maybe that's because I'm small.

1282
01:25:19.912 --> 01:25:22.456
I've always been moving.
and I always counted on movement

1283
01:25:22.456 --> 01:25:24.791
to not only propel me from place to place.

1284
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.545
but to express myself as I propelled
from place to place. and to be who I am.

1285
01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:41.183
But the thing that I learned
was that I couldn't be still in my life.

1286
01:25:41.183 --> 01:25:43.477
I couldn't be present in my life.

1287
01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:54.696
Until I found this thing happened to me

1288
01:25:54.696 --> 01:25:56.657
that made me present
in every moment of my life.

1289
01:25:56.657 --> 01:25:57.783
because it was shaking me awake.

1290
01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.162
There you go.
