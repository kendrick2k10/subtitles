3
00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:52.654
Getting closer. ain't ya?

4
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.760
Whoa! Ah!

5
00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:04.833
Ha ha!
I knew it!

6
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.902
I knew it! I knew it!

7
00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.889
I knew it!
I'm not crazy!

8
00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:27.856
I knew it!

9
00:02:27.923 --> 00:02:30.192
It's been circling for days.

10
00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:36.698
Okay.

11
00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:40.229
Eh.

12
00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.433
Where you at?

13
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.102
Come on.
Where you at?

14
00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:55.677
Come on. Where are you?
Huh?

15
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:03.152
They said I was crazy.
I'm not crazy.

16
00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.289
It's 40 degrees. 40...
40 north.

17
00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:09.024
115.

18
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:11.894
Dammit. Still half an hour
until Shepherd's there.

19
00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:13.963
It's early.

20
00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:18.700
Dale for Shepherd.
Come in Shepherd.

21
00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.402
Dammit.

22
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.608
Sy. if... if you're listening.
if anyone is listening.

23
00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:30.312
at 0600 a vessel of
unknown origin

24
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.949
has crash landed in. uh.

25
00:04:34.016 --> 00:04:38.220
40 degrees north. 115 west.

26
00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:42.992
Shepherd. I told you.

27
00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:46.128
I told everyone.
and now I have proof!

28
00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:48.030
It's been circling for days.
and they...

29
00:04:48.097 --> 00:04:50.332
they've finally arrived.

30
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.333
They've arrived.

31
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.734
They're...

32
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.736
They're... they're here.

33
00:04:57.606 --> 00:05:00.209
Come on. where you at?

34
00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:08.850
Where they at?

35
00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:14.856
Ah!

36
00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:01.070
<i>In 1947. mankind
learned that we are</i>

37
00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:04.073
<i>far from alone in the galaxy.</i>

38
00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.908
<i>In the decades to follow.
we discovered dozens</i>

39
00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:08.143
<i>of intelligent
extraterrestrial species</i>

40
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.381
<i>with the capability
of reaching Earth.</i>

41
00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:15.918
<i>Some of them are friendly...
but some of them are not.</i>

42
00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:18.454
<i>so the US developed
the Alien Defense Unit.</i>

43
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.123
<i>If you're hearing this.
it's because you've been</i>

44
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.427
<i>selected to join
this elite force.</i>

45
00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:28.197
<i>Together we work in secret
to study. communicate with.</i>

46
00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:33.801
<i>and. if necessary. defeat
these alien entities.</i>

47
00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:35.971
<i>They can be powerful allies...</i>

48
00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:38.707
<i>or terrifying new threats.</i>

49
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.310
<i>Now it's up to you
to know the difference.</i>

50
00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:45.180
<i>and to defend our planet
if and when the time comes.</i>

51
00:06:48.017 --> 00:06:50.052
<i>Welcome to the ADU.</i>

52
00:07:18.047 --> 00:07:20.182
Oh. seven hundred.

53
00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:23.619
Come in.
this Early Bird for the Worm.

54
00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:24.687
Hello?

55
00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:27.056
Dale. come in.

56
00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:30.059
Dale? It's Shepherd.
You out there. bud?

57
00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:37.399
Come on. don't make me
come looking for you.

58
00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:49.011
I told you to lay off of
that moonshine of yours

59
00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:51.280
or I'd have to come out
and confiscate it.

60
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.556
All right. Dale.
this isn't funny.

61
00:08:04.993 --> 00:08:06.995
Shepherd over and out.

62
00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:11.767
Ooh.

63
00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:14.036
Colonel Mayweather.
Good morning. sir.

64
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:15.704
That could change. Shepherd.

65
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.706
I'm sure you're aware
that reported sightings

66
00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:20.342
in your sector were ten times
the monthly average last night?

67
00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:21.610
Right?

68
00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.480
Yes. I have a call
into my guy at NORAD.

69
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.081
Don't bother NORAD.

70
00:08:26.148 --> 00:08:27.883
The Air Force wasn't flying.
and our satellites

71
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.651
didn't get a picture of
anything but a lot of desert.

72
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.754
You think something
came down and we missed it?

73
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.857
Well. Since Roswell.
nothing falls from the sky

74
00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:37.526
that isn't tagged and
tracked before John Q. Public

75
00:08:37.593 --> 00:08:39.895
<i>can pick up a smartphone
and snap a picture.</i>

76
00:08:39.962 --> 00:08:43.132
But hundreds of people have
been calling from your sector

77
00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:45.901
reporting that they've
seen some...

78
00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:49.471
fireball in the sky.

79
00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:50.939
A fireball.

80
00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:55.577
Now. is there anything from your
security details last night?

81
00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:57.179
Anything to suggest this?

82
00:08:57.246 --> 00:09:00.249
No. sir.
Business as usual.

83
00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:02.418
Nothing?
Come on. Nothing weird?

84
00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:04.119
Well. I mean. now that
you mention it.

85
00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:08.323
we do have a local guy out
here that radios me

86
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.726
an all clear every morning
like clockwork.

87
00:09:10.793 --> 00:09:12.394
<i>It's not exactly
confirmation of</i>

88
00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:16.031
<i>an alien invasion
or anything. but</i>

89
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:17.466
I haven't heard from him today.

90
00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:20.035
and I don't much
like the coincidence.

91
00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:21.837
You know. if he saw a fireball.

92
00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:23.907
he's the kind of guy
that would go looking for it.

93
00:09:23.972 --> 00:09:26.775
Well. you know. usually
I'd avoid getting my intel

94
00:09:26.842 --> 00:09:29.011
from the tin foil hat community.

95
00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:30.914
but sometimes
you gotta hand it to 'em.

96
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:33.348
Right now that's the best lead
we have. so let's go with it.

97
00:09:33.415 --> 00:09:34.950
We'll check it out pronto. sir.

98
00:09:35.017 --> 00:09:36.385
<i>Now. if something
did come down.</i>

99
00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:38.987
it was invisible until
it was in your airspace.

100
00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:41.323
I need you to confirm
and contain

101
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.993
<i>any conceivable alien force
or give me an all clear.</i>

102
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.197
Otherwise you know
what the protocol is.

103
00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:51.333
I do.

104
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.769
I'm sure it's just. um.
some piece of alien junk

105
00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:56.305
that we don't want falling
into the wrong hands.

106
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.606
<i>We've seen what happens
when these extraterrestrials</i>

107
00:09:57.673 --> 00:09:59.441
<i>make it planetside.</i>

108
00:09:59.508 --> 00:10:01.443
<i>There's a big difference
when they're "just visiting".</i>

109
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.445
<i>When they come in peace they
normally make a show of it.</i>

110
00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:05.915
<i>It's when they're sneaky
that I start to get itchy.</i>

111
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:07.649
<i>so use precaution.</i>

112
00:10:07.716 --> 00:10:12.588
<i>Because when it goes the other
way. it goes bad. so...</i>

113
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.323
- Colonel?
- Mora?

114
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:17.192
Specialist Fairchild
should be inbound now.

115
00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:20.395
One other thing. Shepherd.

116
00:10:20.462 --> 00:10:23.332
I expedited the transfer
of your new specialist.

117
00:10:23.398 --> 00:10:26.068
<i>She should be there shortly.</i>

118
00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:27.569
Utilize her.

119
00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:30.739
The A.D.U.
is. um. it's changing.

120
00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:33.575
They're pushing the old grunts
like us out

121
00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:38.547
and. um. bringing in these
new xeno-anthropologists.

122
00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:40.048
<i>Alien experts.</i>

123
00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:41.183
They think that these
young kids can talk

124
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.618
to these big-headed monsters.

125
00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:43.819
I don't know.

126
00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:45.354
That's not exactly accurate.

127
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.191
Shepherd. say hello
to Melissa Mora.

128
00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:50.826
- Master Sergeant.
- Ma'am.

129
00:10:50.894 --> 00:10:52.861
I'm looking forward to hearing
what you find out there.

130
00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:55.264
<i>I'm sure you're aware.
but your team has</i>

131
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.099
significantly expanded
our understanding

132
00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:59.801
of alien culture and technology.

133
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.470
Happy to help.

134
00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:04.139
Here's to one last
find before you retire.

135
00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:07.309
Uh. well. that depends
on what we find.

136
00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:10.779
With all due respect.
I'm not done yet.

137
00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:12.882
<i>There's still plenty
to do here.</i>

138
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:14.583
<i>Retirement seems a ways off.</i>

139
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.618
<i>Could be sooner than you think.
but before you go.</i>

140
00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:19.388
Shepherd.
Fairchild is the best

141
00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:21.256
and the brightest of
this new generation.

142
00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:24.593
<i>Army. Air Force. MIT.</i>

143
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.729
It wasn't challenging enough for
her. so I'm sending her to you.

144
00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:30.465
And I need you to take an
active role in her training.

145
00:11:30.532 --> 00:11:32.401
<i>because when all
this shit's over with.</i>

146
00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:34.436
she's going to be
your replacement.

147
00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:41.143
Thank you.

148
00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.811
So. what are you in for?

149
00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:18.747
How do you mean?

150
00:12:20.349 --> 00:12:24.653
Well. I was on the
fire team that relocated

151
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.456
the spacecraft from
the dig in Turkey.

152
00:12:27.522 --> 00:12:31.493
That's how I found out that
aliens are. you know. real.

153
00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:36.131
We got a guy on the
base that brought

154
00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:40.535
his date to the test site.

155
00:12:40.602 --> 00:12:41.703
Idiot.

156
00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:46.341
Point is. if you end up
on this detail.

157
00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:48.644
you either screw up
or you see something

158
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.780
that you're not supposed to.

159
00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:53.148
I see.

160
00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.684
So which is it for you?

161
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:56.818
I requested it.

162
00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:02.457
Life outside our solar system
is a statistical likelihood.

163
00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:05.160
Once I realized that.
I knew I would do anything

164
00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:06.395
to make first contact.

165
00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:10.265
Well. I've seen enough
alien weapons to know that

166
00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:15.004
if I'm the one making
the first contact.

167
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:17.239
it's gonna be with this bad boy.

168
00:13:17.305 --> 00:13:19.207
You know what I mean?

169
00:13:19.274 --> 00:13:20.509
Don't you think a first contact

170
00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:23.012
should be more
delicate than that?

171
00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:25.814
Not if you want to survive it.

172
00:13:25.882 --> 00:13:28.617
Why do you think no one ever
mentions a second contact?

173
00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:31.087
That's something
I'm hoping can change.

174
00:13:31.154 --> 00:13:33.388
Well. good luck with that.

175
00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:40.395
Let's go. newbie.

176
00:13:52.607 --> 00:13:56.478
Welcome to
the Alien Defense Unit.

177
00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:57.947
Don't let the looks fool you.

178
00:13:58.014 --> 00:14:00.415
There's more underground
than there is above.

179
00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:01.951
It's hot out here.

180
00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:05.387
This is just where we hang out
and eat and sleep

181
00:14:05.454 --> 00:14:08.057
and train and live.

182
00:14:08.124 --> 00:14:09.291
and probably die.

183
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.861
You'll get used to it.

184
00:14:15.297 --> 00:14:16.798
Where do I find Shepherd?

185
00:14:16.865 --> 00:14:18.300
This way.

186
00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:57.439
You must be
Specialist Fairchild.

187
00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:59.407
Reporting for duty. Sergeant.

188
00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:02.544
Uh. sir. I've already
been briefed

189
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:04.346
on the anomaly in your sector.

190
00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:07.783
It's our sector now.
isn't it. Specialist?

191
00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.351
Yes. sir.

192
00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:11.319
I've taken a closer look
at the satellite imagery

193
00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:12.654
and there seems to be
something causing

194
00:15:12.721 --> 00:15:16.625
a blind spot in your...
our sector. sir.

195
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:18.827
There's no technology on Earth
that I'm aware of

196
00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:20.930
that can do that.

197
00:15:20.997 --> 00:15:24.366
I've sent in a request to
the USGS for a seismic report.

198
00:15:24.432 --> 00:15:26.701
It's possible
whatever fell...

199
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.609
Who mans this comms room?

200
00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:38.446
You do.

201
00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:40.382
Sir. sorry for asking.

202
00:15:40.448 --> 00:15:43.652
but I notice that most of the
staff here is combat oriented.

203
00:15:43.718 --> 00:15:45.188
Don't you think
the unit would benefit

204
00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:47.756
from more science personnel?

205
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.357
We have Bob.

206
00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:51.493
Uh...

207
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.728
Oh yes.
Engineer Robert Drake.

208
00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:55.664
I mean. he's a civilian.

209
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.699
Only on paper.

210
00:15:57.766 --> 00:16:00.569
Bob's got PhDs in science
that don't even exist yet.

211
00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:05.074
Sir. if you don't mind. while
we're on the topic of personnel.

212
00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:06.976
I think it's best that
we don't inform the men

213
00:16:07.043 --> 00:16:09.946
that I'm replacing you
until it actually happens.

214
00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:15.383
I would like to observe
the unit first.

215
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:19.554
Noted.

216
00:16:23.425 --> 00:16:24.793
Hut!

217
00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:29.031
Where's Bob?

218
00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:30.967
On PT with Matteo. sir.

219
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.068
King?

220
00:16:32.134 --> 00:16:34.402
Getting his pack. sir.

221
00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:37.039
Gentlemen. this here
is Specialist Fairchild.

222
00:16:37.106 --> 00:16:38.773
Welcome her to the unit.

223
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.376
Welcome Specialist Fairchild!

224
00:16:41.443 --> 00:16:43.445
Thanks.

225
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:46.015
Better make a good
impression on her.

226
00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.783
She's gonna take over once
they boot me out of here.

227
00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:54.689
You two kit up.
You're with me.

228
00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.325
We're wheels in five.

229
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.261
Get Matteo on the radio
and let's get Bob out here

230
00:16:58.327 --> 00:17:00.795
for a meet and greet.

231
00:17:00.862 --> 00:17:03.598
Everybody standby for orders.
Dismissed.

232
00:17:04.532 --> 00:17:05.902
Where are we heading?

233
00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:07.869
I am headed up to
my friend Dale's place.

234
00:17:07.937 --> 00:17:09.171
I'm gonna have a look around.

235
00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:10.273
I think you should stay here.

236
00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.941
You want me to stay here?

237
00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:13.943
If something's on the ground.
I want to see it pronto.

238
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.477
I want to ID it.

239
00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:17.380
Someone's gotta go through
the call logs from last night

240
00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:20.283
for mentions of a "fireball."
You're the specialist.

241
00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.750
Plot out the sightings.

242
00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:23.551
Maybe we can come up
with a flight path.

243
00:17:23.618 --> 00:17:24.653
You've got your orders.

244
00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:26.521
Shouldn't I go with you?

245
00:17:28.657 --> 00:17:31.160
Specialist. you're my trainee.

246
00:17:31.227 --> 00:17:32.827
I don't know what
Mayweather told you.

247
00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:35.398
but I haven't retired yet.

248
00:17:35.463 --> 00:17:40.468
And until your training is over.
you're with me until I say so.

249
00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:44.472
You're here to learn. not lead.

250
00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:46.175
Understood?

251
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:48.344
Yes. sir.

252
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:49.912
Permission to speak freely. sir?

253
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:51.646
Denied.

254
00:17:51.713 --> 00:17:54.984
If there's a ship out there.
I should be the one to find it.

255
00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:59.454
I guess that's
the difference between us.

256
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:02.091
I hope we don't find anything.

257
00:18:08.863 --> 00:18:11.133
You got this?
Let's go. walk in the park.

258
00:18:13.269 --> 00:18:15.804
Oh. shit.

259
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.042
Can we please be done now?

260
00:18:20.109 --> 00:18:21.410
Come on. Bob.

261
00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.012
How are we supposed to
fight when the aliens attack

262
00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:25.214
if you can't even handle
a little cardio?

263
00:18:25.281 --> 00:18:26.648
You'll really be
screwed when you have

264
00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:28.150
100 pounds of gear on you!

265
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:33.289
Yeah. Attack.

266
00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:34.991
Why do you think... why...

267
00:18:35.057 --> 00:18:38.327
why does everyone always
think that it's an attack. huh?

268
00:18:38.394 --> 00:18:40.029
They been here before.

269
00:18:40.096 --> 00:18:42.465
There've been crashes.
mistakes. misunderstandings.

270
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.501
and yeah. a fight or two. but
there's never been an attack.

271
00:18:46.568 --> 00:18:48.237
We'd be dead!

272
00:18:48.304 --> 00:18:50.872
Then what will it look like
when... if the aliens come back?

273
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.580
Honestly. I don't know.

274
00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:01.516
That's why I need
to be in the lab.

275
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:05.687
not out here training
for combat.

276
00:19:05.754 --> 00:19:07.890
Why am I the only one
that you do this to. huh?

277
00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:09.624
Because everyone else
has been through boot.

278
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.093
You haven't.

279
00:19:13.996 --> 00:19:17.099
Maybe they're studying us.
the aliens.

280
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.268
Studying us?

281
00:19:19.335 --> 00:19:20.302
Yeah.

282
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:22.038
All right.

283
00:19:22.104 --> 00:19:24.140
If they're so advanced. why
would they give a shit about us?

284
00:19:27.476 --> 00:19:29.078
Why do we study ants?

285
00:19:30.812 --> 00:19:32.281
To figure out how to kill them.

286
00:19:33.681 --> 00:19:36.218
<i>Roman to Matteo.</i>

287
00:19:36.285 --> 00:19:38.553
Go for Matteo.

288
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.390
<i>Shepherd wants to egghead
Bob back at the base ASAP.</i>

289
00:19:41.457 --> 00:19:43.959
Everyone's on standby.

290
00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:45.895
We just got here.
What's going on?

291
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:47.496
Don't know. Shepherd's off
site with Sams and King.

292
00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:48.964
Full kit.
He wants you ready to rock.

293
00:19:49.031 --> 00:19:50.865
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Copy. On our way.

294
00:19:52.268 --> 00:19:53.768
Full kit?

295
00:19:55.137 --> 00:19:56.838
What... what's that mean.
ready... ready to rock?

296
00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:59.208
It means on your feet. Bob.

297
00:19:59.275 --> 00:20:01.776
Let's go take a look through
that alien arsenal of yours.

298
00:20:03.012 --> 00:20:04.246
Come on.
Double time.

299
00:20:04.313 --> 00:20:05.847
Just give me a second.

300
00:20:07.116 --> 00:20:08.783
I'm leaving the weights here.

301
00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:23.798
Okay. Let's see what
we have to work with.

302
00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.159
Is that everything?

303
00:20:54.196 --> 00:20:56.664
Everything that I've got
that's operational.

304
00:20:56.731 --> 00:20:58.200
Heavily modified. of course.

305
00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:00.735
All the tech that
we've recovered is ancient.

306
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.906
found in archeological digs
and in frozen ice.

307
00:21:03.973 --> 00:21:06.208
and if it wasn't
for that Roswell crash

308
00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:08.611
and everything
we found afterwards.

309
00:21:08.676 --> 00:21:11.679
I might not have been able to
get any of this stuff to work.

310
00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:14.316
You've seen the Roswell UFO?

311
00:21:14.383 --> 00:21:17.353
It's not unidentified anymore.
Everyone knows that.

312
00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:20.055
And yes. I've seen seven.

313
00:21:20.122 --> 00:21:22.224
I even got to
go inside one once.

314
00:21:25.194 --> 00:21:27.263
It was cramped.

315
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:29.697
Little guys. huh?
Three fingers?

316
00:21:35.037 --> 00:21:37.805
That tech right there
is the same stuff

317
00:21:37.872 --> 00:21:41.143
that the spaceships use
to generate anti-gravity

318
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.281
for navigation in a...
a gravity gauntlet.

319
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.749
We found that underneath
the pyramids.

320
00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:49.385
Once upon a time that
thing would literally

321
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:53.189
just reach out and shape
the earth. move massive objects

322
00:21:53.255 --> 00:21:56.225
all by manipulating
the force of gravity.

323
00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:00.529
I think. anyways.

324
00:22:00.596 --> 00:22:04.333
Well. if you ask me.
that's all we need right there.

325
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.136
Let's pack this baby up
and spank these aliens

326
00:22:07.203 --> 00:22:08.470
with a fist full of gravity.

327
00:22:08.537 --> 00:22:09.905
Hoo-rah.

328
00:22:09.972 --> 00:22:11.407
Well. it's missing
a power source.

329
00:22:11.473 --> 00:22:15.344
It needs. well. more amps
than the human race

330
00:22:15.411 --> 00:22:18.447
has conceived since
the industrial revolution.

331
00:22:18.514 --> 00:22:22.017
So. uh. right now.
it's kind of just an ornament.

332
00:22:22.084 --> 00:22:24.587
It's just a reminder.

333
00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.255
Reminder of what?

334
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.792
3.000 years ago.
while we were rubbing sticks

335
00:22:30.858 --> 00:22:36.065
together to make fire. they
harnessed the power of gravity.

336
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:39.368
and we can't even turn it on.

337
00:22:39.435 --> 00:22:41.836
So. it's a reminder that
we're contending with forces

338
00:22:41.904 --> 00:22:45.174
far beyond what
we even hope to be one day.

339
00:22:46.675 --> 00:22:49.511
But I swear I'm gonna
get that baby to work.

340
00:22:58.554 --> 00:23:01.123
Establish wireless connection
and take control.

341
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:08.330
Average the report sightings
and display vector.

342
00:23:14.703 --> 00:23:16.205
Adjust for Shepherd's heading.

343
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:22.344
Now display new
seismic data and overlay.

344
00:23:31.687 --> 00:23:33.188
Something did fall.

345
00:23:35.624 --> 00:23:37.326
Shepherd. this is Fairchild.

346
00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:38.927
I think you need
to stop the truck.

347
00:23:38.994 --> 00:23:41.563
Shepherd. did you read?
Stop the truck!

348
00:23:54.877 --> 00:23:57.012
Fairchild. come in. Fairchild.

349
00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.480
It's jammed.

350
00:23:58.547 --> 00:24:01.350
Did she say something came down?

351
00:24:25.607 --> 00:24:27.509
You guys hold here
for just a second.

352
00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:32.114
Heya. Dale?

353
00:24:51.934 --> 00:24:53.402
Got some blood here. Shep.

354
00:26:06.341 --> 00:26:08.410
Pack this up for Bob.

355
00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:24.026
Sounds like Dale
might be getting a signal.

356
00:26:35.237 --> 00:26:36.638
Dale. are you in there?

357
00:26:42.211 --> 00:26:43.512
There's something...

358
00:26:45.047 --> 00:26:46.181
There's something here. Shep.

359
00:26:47.917 --> 00:26:49.251
Possible contamination.

360
00:27:05.267 --> 00:27:07.636
Hey. why don't you
get on his radio?

361
00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:11.206
See if you can. uh.
get in touch with base.

362
00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:15.077
Copy that.

363
00:27:15.143 --> 00:27:17.746
Could be he's got
a better signal out.

364
00:27:20.984 --> 00:27:22.751
Dale. what'd you find out here?

365
00:27:29.157 --> 00:27:30.592
There's nothing here.

366
00:27:35.497 --> 00:27:38.033
Jesus!

367
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.401
Get in the truck!

368
00:27:39.468 --> 00:27:42.037
- What about King?
- Get in the truck!

369
00:27:42.104 --> 00:27:44.806
Ahh! Ahh!

370
00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:51.613
It's not down!

371
00:28:03.993 --> 00:28:04.928
Hey. it's...

372
00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:06.595
Shepherd to base.

373
00:28:06.662 --> 00:28:08.163
It's growing!

374
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.066
Threat confirmed.
Threat confirmed!

375
00:28:14.169 --> 00:28:15.103
We're under attack!

376
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.805
Sams!

377
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:21.476
Atta boy.

378
00:28:33.422 --> 00:28:35.724
Whoo!
That's what I'm talking about.

379
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.961
We're gonna bring
this baby with us.

380
00:28:38.027 --> 00:28:40.729
Well. we... we kind of can't.

381
00:28:40.796 --> 00:28:41.998
I... I still have
to figure out how to power that

382
00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:43.532
out in the field.

383
00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.267
I' d have to plug it directly
into the grid

384
00:28:45.334 --> 00:28:46.970
to get enough power
for more than one shot.

385
00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:49.137
This seems to be a reoccurring
issue with you. Bob.

386
00:28:49.204 --> 00:28:50.272
Well...

387
00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:51.640
Do you have anything that works?

388
00:28:51.707 --> 00:28:53.475
<i>Matteo. what's your twenty?</i>

389
00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:55.477
Specialist Fairchild needs
you in the radio room now.

390
00:28:55.544 --> 00:28:57.179
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Copy.

391
00:28:57.245 --> 00:28:59.181
In the warehouse.
On our way.

392
00:28:59.247 --> 00:29:02.117
- Who?
- I don't know.

393
00:29:02.184 --> 00:29:04.319
I swear I have stuff
that works. okay?

394
00:29:04.386 --> 00:29:06.521
Careful with that. Geez.

395
00:29:09.725 --> 00:29:11.493
Listen to this.

396
00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:19.102
I've been recording
every signal

397
00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:20.402
that's strong enough
to come through.

398
00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:22.237
This is the only one.

399
00:29:28.243 --> 00:29:29.979
Holy shit.

400
00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:31.480
That was five minutes ago.

401
00:29:31.546 --> 00:29:33.315
I already sent it
to Mayweather.

402
00:29:33.382 --> 00:29:35.183
I caught a recording
off the citizen's band.

403
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.152
Shepherd must have found
a working frequency.

404
00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:38.654
He said "attack."

405
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.489
That... that doesn't
make any sense.

406
00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:42.591
Looks like your
theory was wrong Bob.

407
00:29:42.658 --> 00:29:44.526
'cause it makes perfect
sense to me.

408
00:29:46.461 --> 00:29:48.463
Mayweather's calling.

409
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.265
I guess you're in charge now.

410
00:29:50.332 --> 00:29:51.867
Better go answer it.

411
00:29:59.876 --> 00:30:01.443
<i>Fairchild. I've listened
to the transmission.</i>

412
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.179
Hate to ask. but any
word from Shepherd yet

413
00:30:04.246 --> 00:30:05.480
<i>or is he still MIA?</i>

414
00:30:05.547 --> 00:30:07.116
Not since
the last transmission. sir.

415
00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:08.850
<i>It's clear we've got an
alien crash.</i>

416
00:30:08.918 --> 00:30:10.285
<i>but we believe the
potential alien craft</i>

417
00:30:10.352 --> 00:30:11.954
<i>is jamming the signal somehow.</i>

418
00:30:12.021 --> 00:30:13.355
<i>So. it's possible
he's out there</i>

419
00:30:13.422 --> 00:30:14.891
<i>but unable to make contact.</i>

420
00:30:14.957 --> 00:30:16.858
I sent his last transmission
to the Joint Chiefs

421
00:30:16.926 --> 00:30:18.326
<i>and they're calling
it proof enough to initiate</i>

422
00:30:18.393 --> 00:30:20.096
<i>the Helion Measure.</i>

423
00:30:20.163 --> 00:30:23.099
Fairchild. looks like your
training's been cut short.

424
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:27.703
Your mission clock is ticking.
so what do you recommend?

425
00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:29.204
Anything?

426
00:30:29.271 --> 00:30:31.174
It's my opinion. sir.
that the recordings tell us

427
00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:33.943
what we already know. something
went down last night.

428
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.445
<i>Between the flight path
and Shepherd's last location.</i>

429
00:30:36.511 --> 00:30:38.747
I think we have a
small enough search radius

430
00:30:38.814 --> 00:30:40.649
for the three of us and
the team here to cover it

431
00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:42.617
within a reasonable
mission window.

432
00:30:42.684 --> 00:30:44.887
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

433
00:30:44.954 --> 00:30:47.389
I'm not going anywhere.
I don't need to be out there.

434
00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:48.857
I... I need to be here.

435
00:30:48.925 --> 00:30:50.625
I'll need Bob's
technical expertise

436
00:30:50.692 --> 00:30:52.661
at the crash site to
accurately access the threat.

437
00:30:52.728 --> 00:30:54.262
<i>There's no one
on Earth more qualified</i>

438
00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:56.364
to identify alien technology.

439
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:01.536
<i>Matteo. is it?
Lance Corporal.</i>

440
00:31:01.603 --> 00:31:03.072
Yes. sir.

441
00:31:03.139 --> 00:31:05.108
<i>Your orders are to
locate the crash site</i>

442
00:31:05.174 --> 00:31:08.945
<i>and recover your commanding
officer or confirm his death.</i>

443
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:11.580
<i>I need containment
and elimination</i>

444
00:31:11.646 --> 00:31:13.448
<i>of the alien threat
before sundown</i>

445
00:31:13.515 --> 00:31:15.918
or I assume you know
the protocol. right. Fairchild?

446
00:31:15.985 --> 00:31:17.586
I do. sir.

447
00:31:17.652 --> 00:31:19.588
<i>Good. because there's
no time left to waste.</i>

448
00:31:19.654 --> 00:31:21.490
<i>Find the rest of your team
and get them back safe.</i>

449
00:31:21.556 --> 00:31:23.625
<i>I'm counting on all of you.
Good luck.</i>

450
00:31:24.994 --> 00:31:26.328
Mayweather out.

451
00:31:28.164 --> 00:31:29.598
What did he mean?

452
00:31:29.664 --> 00:31:32.034
Protocol?
Well. what's protocol?

453
00:31:32.101 --> 00:31:34.170
The Helion Measure.

454
00:31:34.237 --> 00:31:38.440
A thermonuclear warhead launched
from an orbital satellite.

455
00:31:38.507 --> 00:31:40.209
Are you serious?

456
00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:42.310
Only in the event
that the alien threat

457
00:31:42.377 --> 00:31:44.279
spreads beyond our ability
to contain it.

458
00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:45.647
Why didn't I know about this?

459
00:31:45.714 --> 00:31:47.282
Because you're a civilian. Bob.

460
00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:48.550
You don't have the clearance.

461
00:31:48.617 --> 00:31:50.219
If I would've known that. I...

462
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:52.354
I wouldn't have brought
my entire collection here.

463
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.991
The contents of
that warehouse is...

464
00:31:55.057 --> 00:31:57.325
irreplaceable. literally.

465
00:31:57.392 --> 00:32:00.829
All my work.
countless alien artifacts.

466
00:32:00.897 --> 00:32:02.731
I... I mean. nothing
would survive that blast.

467
00:32:02.798 --> 00:32:05.367
That's the point. Bob.

468
00:32:05.433 --> 00:32:06.501
We're here.

469
00:32:06.568 --> 00:32:08.470
That... that nuclear blast.

470
00:32:08.537 --> 00:32:10.106
that will eradicate
this entire area.

471
00:32:10.173 --> 00:32:13.176
not to mention kill hundreds
of thousands of people.

472
00:32:13.242 --> 00:32:15.978
It's not going to come to that.

473
00:32:16.045 --> 00:32:20.216
Did you hear that thing
on the recording?

474
00:32:20.283 --> 00:32:24.120
Something is out there.
and we don't know what it is.

475
00:32:24.187 --> 00:32:26.388
I mean. breathing the same air
as it could be lethal.

476
00:32:26.454 --> 00:32:29.758
For all we know.
it's a biological attack.

477
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:33.062
So we follow protocol
and we wear our masks.

478
00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:36.565
And what if the aliens
just kills us?

479
00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:38.333
I hear you have a
whole alien arsenal;

480
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.036
is that true?

481
00:32:40.102 --> 00:32:41.503
Yes.

482
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.706
Good. Then bring it.
We have our orders.

483
00:32:44.773 --> 00:32:48.077
Secure the crash site. identify
the threat. and eliminate it.

484
00:32:48.144 --> 00:32:49.511
What about Shepherd?

485
00:32:49.578 --> 00:32:51.047
Shouldn't we be
heading to Dale's?

486
00:32:51.113 --> 00:32:53.381
If he's alive. his orders
are the same as ours:

487
00:32:53.448 --> 00:32:55.184
Identify and contain.

488
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:57.819
I want to know what we're up
against before we run into it.

489
00:32:57.887 --> 00:33:01.090
Whatever's jamming the signal
is coming from that crash.

490
00:33:01.157 --> 00:33:02.858
If Bob can disable it.

491
00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:04.994
then we can use the satellites
to find Shepherd's vehicle

492
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:07.096
and hopefully figure out
what we're dealing with.

493
00:33:07.163 --> 00:33:10.632
That means the crash site
is our first priority.

494
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:12.969
Round up. bring everything
that you need.

495
00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:15.403
That includes you. Bob.

496
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.939
Let's go.

497
00:33:18.607 --> 00:33:21.543
Wait. n... no.

498
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.080
What did I tell... I...
I'm not going anywhere.

499
00:33:38.793 --> 00:33:40.930
Road ends here. we'll have
to go the rest on foot.

500
00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:44.699
This should be it.

501
00:33:48.436 --> 00:33:49.906
All right.
Put on your mask.

502
00:33:49.972 --> 00:33:51.439
Stay sharp.

503
00:33:51.506 --> 00:33:53.775
We don't know how many targets
we might be dealing with.

504
00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:03.886
Those alien guns of
Bob's work. right?

505
00:34:03.953 --> 00:34:04.987
Oh. yeah.

506
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:07.622
Good.

507
00:34:08.623 --> 00:34:10.359
Should be just over that ridge.

508
00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:12.627
Make it safe and
hold position.

509
00:34:12.694 --> 00:34:14.096
We're right behind you.

510
00:34:14.163 --> 00:34:15.164
Bob. let's go.

511
00:34:16.698 --> 00:34:18.600
Bob. gonna need you out here.

512
00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:20.102
I'll bring up the van.

513
00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:23.838
Van's close enough. Bob.
Let's go.

514
00:34:25.007 --> 00:34:27.742
You know. you might have
to follow orders.

515
00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:30.112
but I'm technically
just a civilian. remember?

516
00:34:31.713 --> 00:34:34.016
Cut the shit. Bob.

517
00:34:34.083 --> 00:34:37.219
We both know your choices were
here or a mile under Groom Lake.

518
00:34:39.587 --> 00:34:41.656
I read your file.
your whole file.

519
00:34:41.723 --> 00:34:43.825
even your unredacted thesis.

520
00:34:43.893 --> 00:34:45.027
Hmm.

521
00:34:45.094 --> 00:34:46.929
I thought they erased all
my academic work.

522
00:34:49.065 --> 00:34:50.333
With what you know.

523
00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:52.634
they'll never let you go
back to civilian life.

524
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:54.803
Your deal was a hole
in the ground

525
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:57.106
or a place where you
can work and see the sky.

526
00:34:57.173 --> 00:34:59.141
even if things are
falling out of it.

527
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.145
I meant what I said
to Mayweather.

528
00:35:03.212 --> 00:35:05.247
There's no one on
Earth more qualified

529
00:35:05.314 --> 00:35:06.916
with alien tech than you.

530
00:35:06.983 --> 00:35:10.052
Come on. Bob. where's your
scientific curiosity?

531
00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:11.519
You're the expert.

532
00:35:11.586 --> 00:35:14.357
We need you out there.

533
00:35:14.423 --> 00:35:17.826
Well. you know. "by sundown"

534
00:35:17.893 --> 00:35:19.728
is plenty of time
for us to get outside

535
00:35:19.794 --> 00:35:23.265
the blast radius if we go now.

536
00:35:23.332 --> 00:35:25.600
Not without transpo.

537
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:27.003
Bob. if we are going
to find Shepherd

538
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:29.238
and complete our mission.
I need you

539
00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:32.841
to shut off whatever's
jamming the signal.

540
00:35:32.908 --> 00:35:34.343
Then. I'll check the gear.

541
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.079
Bob. I don't need your
gear right now.

542
00:35:38.847 --> 00:35:41.951
I need your eyes and I need
your brain and I need your feet.

543
00:35:42.018 --> 00:35:43.119
Come on.

544
00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.256
I'll go when it's clear.

545
00:35:51.193 --> 00:35:52.962
Matteo. we clear?

546
00:35:57.933 --> 00:35:59.935
No tangos. We're clear.

547
00:36:00.002 --> 00:36:01.303
We're clear. Let's go.

548
00:36:02.537 --> 00:36:04.140
Coming.

549
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:08.810
This is why
I don't come out here.

550
00:36:14.016 --> 00:36:16.318
There's a lot of shit
on the ground.

551
00:36:16.385 --> 00:36:17.685
Don't touch anything.

552
00:36:27.063 --> 00:36:28.797
All right. the atmosphere
is clear.

553
00:36:28.863 --> 00:36:30.598
It's okay to
take off your masks.

554
00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:33.936
All good?

555
00:36:37.106 --> 00:36:38.240
All good.

556
00:36:40.476 --> 00:36:42.111
No sign of Shepherd either.

557
00:36:43.645 --> 00:36:47.249
Oh my God. look at that thing.

558
00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:50.685
Matteo. Roman.
head up and take a look.

559
00:36:50.752 --> 00:36:53.655
Copy!
C'mon. Rome. let's go.

560
00:36:57.792 --> 00:36:59.161
Visual on the crash.

561
00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:14.143
Listen.

562
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:17.313
You hear that?

563
00:37:18.514 --> 00:37:20.648
No.

564
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.919
Thought I heard something.

565
00:37:25.354 --> 00:37:27.755
Oh. shit! Let him go!

566
00:37:29.158 --> 00:37:30.159
Ah!

567
00:37:32.595 --> 00:37:33.695
Roman!

568
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:35.197
Matteo. take cover!

569
00:37:35.264 --> 00:37:36.631
Ah!

570
00:37:36.698 --> 00:37:38.267
Ridge line. fire!

571
00:37:40.469 --> 00:37:42.404
Keys! Keys!

572
00:37:42.471 --> 00:37:43.738
Come on. keys!

573
00:37:45.707 --> 00:37:47.109
Wait. Bob. what are you doing?

574
00:37:56.252 --> 00:37:57.253
Hold fire!

575
00:37:57.319 --> 00:37:59.721
Matteo. on your feet.
Fall back.

576
00:37:59.787 --> 00:38:01.590
Where is it?
I can't see anything.

577
00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:04.059
Cover Matteo.
Probing fire.

578
00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:11.567
No hits.

579
00:38:11.634 --> 00:38:12.767
Bob!

580
00:38:18.073 --> 00:38:20.576
Come on. come on.
open up. come on!

581
00:38:20.643 --> 00:38:21.577
Come on!

582
00:38:23.145 --> 00:38:24.280
Bob!

583
00:38:37.293 --> 00:38:38.826
I'm coming!

584
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.833
Watch your eyes.

585
00:38:58.147 --> 00:39:00.182
Open fire!

586
00:39:14.063 --> 00:39:16.532
Anything from
Shepherd's team yet?

587
00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:18.267
I'm still waiting.

588
00:39:18.334 --> 00:39:20.970
Every eye in the sky we've
got is on the Nevada desert.

589
00:39:21.036 --> 00:39:24.306
yet we can't see a thing.
Hmm.

590
00:39:28.544 --> 00:39:31.447
Have you considered sending
in a diplomatic agent?

591
00:39:31.513 --> 00:39:34.083
- Someone like...
- You?

592
00:39:34.149 --> 00:39:38.420
No.
No. Mora. um. I haven't.

593
00:39:38.487 --> 00:39:40.456
I could play. uh.
Shepherd's last transmission.

594
00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:43.359
but it sure as shit
doesn't sound like diplomacy.

595
00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:48.397
And now that
we're on Helion protocol.

596
00:39:48.464 --> 00:39:51.300
nothing or no one can go in
or out until it's over.

597
00:39:51.367 --> 00:39:55.437
What I'd like to do is.
uh. send in a battalion.

598
00:39:55.504 --> 00:40:00.309
Along with maybe 25 guys
like me when I was 30.

599
00:40:01.677 --> 00:40:03.245
teach these ETs a lesson.

600
00:40:03.312 --> 00:40:06.482
You know. something like. um.

601
00:40:06.548 --> 00:40:09.885
come in peace or go in pieces.

602
00:40:11.687 --> 00:40:14.957
Yeah. I like that.

603
00:40:15.024 --> 00:40:18.826
But another day.
Dismissed.

604
00:41:40.008 --> 00:41:43.412
Now. we're clear.

605
00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:45.381
I didn't know where to shoot.
so I grabbed something

606
00:41:45.447 --> 00:41:47.783
that could shoot
everywhere at once.

607
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.286
Cloaked. but not tech.

608
00:41:51.353 --> 00:41:53.355
Biological like a...
like a chameleon.

609
00:41:53.422 --> 00:41:55.624
It's not really my expertise.

610
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:57.126
Bob. are you okay?

611
00:41:57.192 --> 00:41:59.061
Yeah. It's just I had
to overload the gear

612
00:41:59.128 --> 00:42:03.132
to generate enough charge
for that static blast.

613
00:42:03.198 --> 00:42:06.835
We... we got it. right?

614
00:42:06.902 --> 00:42:08.971
We got one.
but something tells me

615
00:42:09.037 --> 00:42:10.672
that wasn't what
Shepherd encountered.

616
00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:13.909
What we heard over that
transmission was big and loud.

617
00:42:13.976 --> 00:42:16.645
This one didn't make a sound.

618
00:42:16.712 --> 00:42:18.113
Bendis. wide perimeter.

619
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.782
This might not be
our only threat.

620
00:42:19.848 --> 00:42:22.084
What do you want me to look for?

621
00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:24.019
I don't know. Footprints.

622
00:42:26.488 --> 00:42:28.157
Matteo. we good?

623
00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:31.360
Roman's dead.

624
00:42:33.495 --> 00:42:35.864
The others are
probably dead too.

625
00:42:35.964 --> 00:42:37.299
We don't know that.

626
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:40.803
Shepherd knows the protocol.

627
00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:43.038
If he's alive. for all
we know. he's probably

628
00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:45.274
already heading back to base
or getting clear.

629
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.042
Or he needs our help.

630
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:48.577
You need to call Mayweather.

631
00:42:48.644 --> 00:42:50.279
Why?

632
00:42:50.345 --> 00:42:52.114
He needs to launch a nuke.
and we need to get out of here.

633
00:42:52.181 --> 00:42:53.615
Are you nuts?

634
00:42:53.682 --> 00:42:55.784
I am not losing
another man out here.

635
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:57.453
Thousands of people will die.

636
00:42:57.519 --> 00:42:59.688
We still have time
to evacuate the region.

637
00:42:59.755 --> 00:43:02.357
No! No.
Not completely.

638
00:43:02.424 --> 00:43:05.127
Look. Shepherd didn't
even make it here.

639
00:43:05.194 --> 00:43:07.296
He was attacked
by something else.

640
00:43:07.362 --> 00:43:08.831
and there's more
of these things out here.

641
00:43:08.898 --> 00:43:11.633
Let's just nuke 'em
and be done with it.

642
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.735
Hello? We're still here!

643
00:43:13.802 --> 00:43:15.637
Then let's not be.

644
00:43:15.704 --> 00:43:16.906
I'll call Mayweather.

645
00:43:16.972 --> 00:43:18.006
You can't.

646
00:43:18.073 --> 00:43:20.877
- Watch me.
- Okay.

647
00:43:20.944 --> 00:43:22.978
You can't.

648
00:43:23.045 --> 00:43:24.613
Something's jamming the signal.

649
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.950
It's probably out there
in the crash site.

650
00:43:27.015 --> 00:43:30.954
We still have a mission to do
here. and we still have time.

651
00:43:31.019 --> 00:43:33.155
There can be something down
there that can help us.

652
00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:34.690
Right now I need you
on perimeter

653
00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:36.391
so Bob can get to work.

654
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:40.028
Every minute we spend arguing
out here puts us in danger.

655
00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:45.234
Are they still trying
to study us. Bob?

656
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.402
Tell me. what are they
gonna learn from this. huh?

657
00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:49.638
I don't know. okay?
I don't know.

658
00:43:49.705 --> 00:43:52.774
It's more important
what we learn here.

659
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:54.911
We'll find Shepherd soon.

660
00:43:54.978 --> 00:43:57.179
Yeah. well. I hope so.

661
00:43:57.246 --> 00:43:58.714
Shepherd would know
what to do right now.

662
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.853
Bob. we are not gonna
find Shepherd or our targets

663
00:44:04.921 --> 00:44:07.256
unless we figure out
what's jamming the signal.

664
00:44:07.322 --> 00:44:09.124
What do you got for me?

665
00:44:10.492 --> 00:44:13.195
Well. uh. the... the fastest
way to do that would be

666
00:44:13.262 --> 00:44:15.564
to shut off power
to the ship. but...

667
00:44:15.631 --> 00:44:18.534
with every alien craft
that I've seen.

668
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.836
and I've seen every single
one that we know of.

669
00:44:20.904 --> 00:44:23.572
there's...
there's a. uh. a power cell.

670
00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:27.075
It's small. efficient enough
to run

671
00:44:27.142 --> 00:44:29.678
effectively forever.

672
00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:32.180
It could be anywhere out
there in the wreckage

673
00:44:32.247 --> 00:44:34.918
and still be feeding
the signal jammer.

674
00:44:34.984 --> 00:44:38.053
Okay. then let's find it.

675
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.588
Okay.

676
00:46:20.389 --> 00:46:23.692
I can hear you.
you son of a bitch.

677
00:46:25.527 --> 00:46:27.262
I'm coming for you.

678
00:46:42.177 --> 00:46:43.845
Bob. tell me you
found something.

679
00:46:45.114 --> 00:46:46.883
Not really.

680
00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:49.584
Uh. from the debris that
I found. I... I can conclude

681
00:46:49.651 --> 00:46:54.756
that it came from the same
origin. but it's different.

682
00:46:54.823 --> 00:46:56.425
How?

683
00:46:56.491 --> 00:47:00.362
Well. for starters.
I didn't see a cockpit or...

684
00:47:00.429 --> 00:47:03.432
or any copilots for that matter.

685
00:47:03.498 --> 00:47:07.103
Um. I... I saw inside there
were like three cells

686
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.538
maybe for cargo or for holding.

687
00:47:09.604 --> 00:47:11.273
I can figure it out.
I just need to kill the power.

688
00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:13.608
How much longer?

689
00:47:13.675 --> 00:47:14.743
Hold tight.

690
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.778
Bob.
We're running out of time.

691
00:47:16.845 --> 00:47:20.382
Threat's ID'd and we need
to move to containment.

692
00:47:20.449 --> 00:47:22.085
I don't know. maybe
if we head to Dale's camp

693
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:23.218
we can track it from there.

694
00:47:23.285 --> 00:47:26.288
No. no. no.
We split up.

695
00:47:26.354 --> 00:47:28.390
You get to the van
and you find Shepherd.

696
00:47:28.457 --> 00:47:30.059
I'll go back on board
and I'll find a way

697
00:47:30.126 --> 00:47:31.460
to kill the signal jammer.

698
00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:34.563
I just have to find
the power cell.

699
00:47:34.629 --> 00:47:36.264
I don't like the idea
of splitting up.

700
00:47:36.331 --> 00:47:38.233
Yeah. but we have to.

701
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.368
Yeah. But we need
to find this thing.

702
00:47:42.004 --> 00:47:42.972
Okay.

703
00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:46.775
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

704
00:47:51.279 --> 00:47:52.514
What... what is that?

705
00:47:52.581 --> 00:47:54.951
We... are you getting
signal here. or...

706
00:47:55.017 --> 00:47:57.053
No signal yet. but I'm
scanning the data-sphere

707
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.588
around the ship to see if
I can pick anything up.

708
00:47:59.654 --> 00:48:01.289
So far it's just scrambled code.

709
00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:06.361
What do you know
about the data-sphere?

710
00:48:06.428 --> 00:48:07.429
Everything you do.

711
00:48:07.496 --> 00:48:10.398
I read your work. remember?

712
00:48:10.465 --> 00:48:12.834
Yeah. But I just...
I just did the math.

713
00:48:12.902 --> 00:48:14.436
You made a...

714
00:48:14.503 --> 00:48:16.438
Wireless alien super computer.

715
00:48:16.505 --> 00:48:18.941
You did that before me?
Can I see it?

716
00:48:20.509 --> 00:48:23.745
Bob. I'll let you know
if I find anything.

717
00:48:23.812 --> 00:48:25.181
Get back to work.

718
00:48:25.248 --> 00:48:26.883
Okay.

719
00:48:26.949 --> 00:48:28.450
That's so cool.

720
00:48:28.517 --> 00:48:29.986
That's it. let's wrap it up.

721
00:48:30.052 --> 00:48:31.286
Moving out now?

722
00:48:31.353 --> 00:48:33.256
You and me. yes.
Bob still has work to do.

723
00:48:33.321 --> 00:48:35.925
If he doesn't find the power
supply and disable the jammer.

724
00:48:35.992 --> 00:48:37.592
we'll never find
Shepherd in time.

725
00:48:37.659 --> 00:48:39.628
If Bob's right.
there could be at least

726
00:48:39.694 --> 00:48:41.164
two more of these
things out here.

727
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.764
Bendis. you stay with him.

728
00:48:42.831 --> 00:48:44.766
It's critical that
he's allowed to finish.

729
00:49:51.033 --> 00:49:54.937
Oh. no. oh no no no.
what did I just do?!

730
00:49:56.272 --> 00:49:57.974
Oh! Oh. look at that!

731
00:50:01.177 --> 00:50:02.844
Oh!

732
00:50:09.118 --> 00:50:10.052
I found it!

733
00:50:11.653 --> 00:50:13.222
Bob. what'd you do?

734
00:50:13.289 --> 00:50:14.456
I found it!

735
00:50:16.359 --> 00:50:17.927
Take cover. it's coming.

736
00:50:19.095 --> 00:50:21.463
Bendis. watch out!

737
00:50:36.879 --> 00:50:38.613
Bendis!

738
00:50:40.149 --> 00:50:41.250
Where are you going?

739
00:50:41.317 --> 00:50:42.651
I have an idea.

740
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.524
Bob!

741
00:51:10.346 --> 00:51:11.479
Oh. sh......

742
00:51:20.755 --> 00:51:22.358
Shepherd. you're alive!

743
00:51:22.425 --> 00:51:24.226
Not for long unless
you have a plan!

744
00:51:24.293 --> 00:51:25.694
- Here. put this on.
- How?

745
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.064
- Live long and prosper!
- What?

746
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.699
Like this! Cover us!

747
00:51:32.401 --> 00:51:33.702
Look out behind you!

748
00:51:36.973 --> 00:51:38.007
Incoming!

749
00:51:38.074 --> 00:51:39.541
Bob. come on. I need power.
Now!

750
00:51:40.542 --> 00:51:41.843
I'm ready to go. here.

751
00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:44.479
You got it. you got it!

752
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.092
Whoo!

753
00:51:56.158 --> 00:51:57.393
Splat!

754
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.061
Woo!

755
00:52:01.563 --> 00:52:03.966
- It worked!
- You got it.

756
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.669
Oh!

757
00:52:07.736 --> 00:52:09.537
You had that thing
this whole time?

758
00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:11.873
All right. Matteo. back off.

759
00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:13.541
We're vulnerable out here.

760
00:52:13.608 --> 00:52:14.877
- No shit.
- Hey.

761
00:52:14.944 --> 00:52:16.245
Don't you get it. Bob?

762
00:52:18.347 --> 00:52:20.349
We're the ants. Us.

763
00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:21.984
Okay.

764
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.062
Glad to see you're
all right. sir.

765
00:52:33.129 --> 00:52:34.163
Where we at?

766
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:36.298
Well. Mayweather
started the mission clock

767
00:52:36.365 --> 00:52:38.200
when you went MIA this morning.

768
00:52:38.267 --> 00:52:40.869
We're halfway to Helion
with two tangos down.

769
00:52:40.936 --> 00:52:44.106
That crash site secured.
well. what's left of it anyway.

770
00:52:44.173 --> 00:52:46.008
I thought we were dealing
with one of these monsters.

771
00:52:46.075 --> 00:52:46.976
but three?

772
00:52:47.043 --> 00:52:48.576
There's another one out there.

773
00:52:48.643 --> 00:52:52.348
It got King and Sams.
and it's growing.

774
00:52:52.415 --> 00:52:55.217
Every time it eats it gets
bigger. and this thing's hungry.

775
00:52:55.284 --> 00:52:57.752
Considering how fast
it got to Dale's camp.

776
00:52:57.819 --> 00:52:59.788
it could be anywhere by now.

777
00:52:59.854 --> 00:53:02.124
What do you suggest?

778
00:53:02.191 --> 00:53:03.993
Well. Bob was
able to deactivate

779
00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.794
whatever was
jamming the signals.

780
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.496
I just touched it.
I'm sorry.

781
00:53:07.562 --> 00:53:08.663
It's not your fault. Bob.

782
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:09.965
At least when the ship blew up

783
00:53:10.032 --> 00:53:11.833
it took the
signal jammer with it.

784
00:53:11.901 --> 00:53:13.335
If it's as big as you say it is.
we can use the satellites

785
00:53:13.402 --> 00:53:15.204
to scan the surrounding
areas and track it.

786
00:53:15.271 --> 00:53:18.807
Oh. no. that's a negative.
It travels underground.

787
00:53:18.873 --> 00:53:20.376
There has to be a
way to find it.

788
00:53:20.443 --> 00:53:22.577
Listen. this thing
shrugged off standard fire.

789
00:53:22.644 --> 00:53:25.680
a whole belt full of ordnance.

790
00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:26.681
You got anything in
your collection

791
00:53:26.748 --> 00:53:29.018
with a little more kick?

792
00:53:29.085 --> 00:53:32.555
Everything that I had
that worked was in the van.

793
00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.992
That giant smashed everything
trying to get inside.

794
00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:39.495
But if I can get that back
to the lab. I...

795
00:53:39.562 --> 00:53:40.896
I can get something
for you. yeah.

796
00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:46.335
Matteo...

797
00:53:47.669 --> 00:53:49.138
Anything to add?

798
00:53:52.908 --> 00:53:55.610
Bendis and Roman are dead.

799
00:53:55.677 --> 00:53:57.179
Who's gonna be next. Shep?

800
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:03.252
Let's make it count then.

801
00:54:06.388 --> 00:54:08.857
Okay. let's load up.
We're RTB in five.

802
00:54:10.692 --> 00:54:14.662
But first. show me the spaceship
I've heard so much about.

803
00:54:30.346 --> 00:54:33.415
How can we be sure there's
nothing left in there?

804
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.851
Bob said he saw
three compartments.

805
00:54:36.919 --> 00:54:38.921
He said they looked
like holding cells.

806
00:54:38.988 --> 00:54:42.690
Could be breeding chambers.
cryogenic pods.

807
00:54:42.757 --> 00:54:44.126
This could be a zoo
for all we know.

808
00:54:44.193 --> 00:54:46.028
The big one didn't
come out until Bob

809
00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:49.298
disabled the power to the ship.
like it was being held somehow.

810
00:54:49.365 --> 00:54:51.600
This could be some kind
of containment vessel.

811
00:54:51.666 --> 00:54:55.670
You think something rounded them
out and shot them into space?

812
00:54:55.737 --> 00:54:57.072
Possibly.

813
00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:01.843
You see that blue oily
stuff over there?

814
00:55:01.911 --> 00:55:04.947
That was on Dale's trailer
and on the truck.

815
00:55:05.014 --> 00:55:08.517
Everywhere that oily son
of a bitch goes. that stuff.

816
00:55:08.584 --> 00:55:10.052
That's how we track this thing.

817
00:55:10.119 --> 00:55:11.921
If this thing is leaving
this stuff behind.

818
00:55:11.987 --> 00:55:13.688
all I need to do is get
a sample back to the lab

819
00:55:13.755 --> 00:55:15.324
for analysis and upload
it to Mayweather.

820
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:17.626
I just need to tell them
what they're looking for

821
00:55:17.692 --> 00:55:19.195
Now that we have
the satellites back.

822
00:55:19.261 --> 00:55:21.630
we can use every one of
them to track it.

823
00:55:21.696 --> 00:55:23.165
Well. let's get back to the lab.

824
00:55:25.867 --> 00:55:27.735
Come on. Specialist.

825
00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:32.541
Sir...

826
00:55:32.608 --> 00:55:35.511
We're getting really
close to mission failure.

827
00:55:35.578 --> 00:55:39.548
which means we won't have
time to clear the Helion blast.

828
00:55:39.615 --> 00:55:41.517
We're not gonna let that happen.

829
00:55:41.584 --> 00:55:46.322
Listen. Sams injured it. and if
he injured it. we can kill it.

830
00:55:46.388 --> 00:55:47.489
We just have to find it.

831
00:55:51.994 --> 00:55:53.329
All right. move out!

832
00:56:18.354 --> 00:56:20.589
I want Mayweather
to hear your prison theory.

833
00:56:20.656 --> 00:56:22.992
Maybe he'll kick it over
to Xenoanthropology.

834
00:56:23.058 --> 00:56:25.160
see if it tracks with any
of the known ETs.

835
00:56:25.227 --> 00:56:26.929
Would that delay
the Helion Measure?

836
00:56:26.996 --> 00:56:29.098
Possibly.
We'll try.

837
00:56:29.164 --> 00:56:32.368
But either way we still need
to track this thing down now.

838
00:56:32.434 --> 00:56:33.936
I just need
access to the lab and

839
00:56:34.003 --> 00:56:35.504
enough processing power
to recalibrate

840
00:56:35.571 --> 00:56:37.139
the ADU's satellite network.

841
00:56:37.206 --> 00:56:39.108
If I can get this cell
wired to the base grid.

842
00:56:39.174 --> 00:56:40.442
we'll have all
the power we need.

843
00:56:40.509 --> 00:56:42.177
All I want to hear
is that

844
00:56:42.244 --> 00:56:43.746
your weapons are
gonna work. Bob.

845
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:45.881
After a day
like today.

846
00:56:45.948 --> 00:56:47.316
retirement doesn't look so bad.

847
00:56:50.852 --> 00:56:56.158
Shepherd. did
the aliens say anything?

848
00:56:59.728 --> 00:57:02.231
They did not.

849
00:57:02.298 --> 00:57:04.033
Hmm.

850
00:57:04.099 --> 00:57:05.634
Well. I think
it's clear that this

851
00:57:05.701 --> 00:57:07.869
isn't a matter of translation.

852
00:57:07.936 --> 00:57:09.772
<i>This is a matter of war.</i>

853
00:57:09.837 --> 00:57:11.674
<i>Shepherd. I'm glad to
see you're all right.</i>

854
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.709
I'm sorry I can't say
the same for the...

855
00:57:13.776 --> 00:57:16.178
the men you lost today. but
we don't have time to mourn.

856
00:57:16.245 --> 00:57:18.747
We're about to begin
a very costly evacuation

857
00:57:18.813 --> 00:57:21.717
of the surrounding area.

858
00:57:21.784 --> 00:57:24.420
<i>Have you contained the threat?</i>

859
00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:27.723
We have not. sir.

860
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.727
You need to do that. now.

861
00:57:31.794 --> 00:57:33.228
Sir. we're doing
everything we can.

862
00:57:33.295 --> 00:57:35.164
Specialist Fairchild
is working on a way

863
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:37.766
of tracking the last
remaining alien target.

864
00:57:37.865 --> 00:57:39.101
Send analysis and
calibrate the satellites

865
00:57:39.168 --> 00:57:40.602
for new search parameters.

866
00:57:45.307 --> 00:57:48.277
Bob has a working alien arsenal
thanks to a power supply

867
00:57:48.344 --> 00:57:50.212
that he recovered
from the crash site.

868
00:57:54.983 --> 00:57:56.385
We know we can hurt it.

869
00:57:56.452 --> 00:57:57.920
Display progress.

870
00:57:57.986 --> 00:57:59.988
Soon we'll be able to find it.

871
00:58:14.503 --> 00:58:17.740
The way I see it. there's still
four of us and one of them.

872
00:58:17.806 --> 00:58:20.142
I don't see it like that.
I see you have to do it.

873
00:58:20.209 --> 00:58:21.410
Now.

874
00:58:21.477 --> 00:58:22.644
We'll kill it.

875
00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:32.654
Shepherd. Shepherd. do you copy?

876
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.031
Shepherd?

877
00:58:46.368 --> 00:58:48.203
Ah!

878
00:58:50.038 --> 00:58:53.108
I assure you. my team has
everything under control.

879
00:58:57.045 --> 00:58:58.981
Shep...

880
00:59:08.357 --> 00:59:10.325
Oh. sorry!

881
00:59:12.428 --> 00:59:13.897
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

882
00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:15.364
That was me.

883
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:17.599
It's coming right back up.
I promise.

884
00:59:27.843 --> 00:59:29.178
Bob.

885
01:00:02.611 --> 01:00:05.414
If anyone can hear me.
it's already here.

886
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:09.117
Oh. shit.

887
01:00:20.062 --> 01:00:21.363
Shit!

888
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.431
Matteo?

889
01:00:23.967 --> 01:00:25.367
Matteo!

890
01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.539
Ah! No!

891
01:00:31.406 --> 01:00:34.476
Oh! Matteo's dead.

892
01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:36.211
I repeat. Matteo is dead!
The alien is in the compound!

893
01:00:39.448 --> 01:00:40.382
Oh. God...

894
01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:52.828
Confirm that last.

895
01:00:52.896 --> 01:00:56.498
Bob? I didn't copy.
Where's the god damn power?

896
01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:58.400
Working on it!

897
01:00:58.467 --> 01:01:00.235
Come on!

898
01:01:00.302 --> 01:01:04.606
Okay. this one.
this is the one!

899
01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:06.608
Okay.

900
01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:08.176
Okay. okay. okay.

901
01:01:13.649 --> 01:01:16.351
Watch your heads. it got
through the ceiling vent!

902
01:01:24.493 --> 01:01:25.594
Guys...

903
01:01:28.031 --> 01:01:31.600
Please... it's just me. okay?

904
01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:06.301
<i>Come in. anyone!
What's going on out there?</i>

905
01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:13.642
Hello?

906
01:02:20.248 --> 01:02:23.251
Come in. I need a status update!

907
01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:41.938
Shepherd. what the hell's
going on over there?

908
01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.974
Uh. we're having a
little power issue. sir.

909
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.808
Shepherd. it's here!

910
01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:48.644
Shepherd. have you located
the alien threat?

911
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:51.047
Sir. we have a twenty
on the target.

912
01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:53.215
Gonna have to call you back.

913
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:54.449
Shepherd!

914
01:02:54.516 --> 01:02:57.552
- Where?
- It's in the lab.

915
01:02:57.619 --> 01:03:00.188
Good.
We're gonna keep it there.

916
01:03:00.255 --> 01:03:01.523
We'll trap it.

917
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.059
Do you have any
explosive ordnance?

918
01:03:03.126 --> 01:03:05.160
I... I can think of
something. yeah.

919
01:03:05.227 --> 01:03:07.930
Shepherd.
Fairchild's in the lab.

920
01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:12.367
Well. we'll have
to get her out then.

921
01:03:49.105 --> 01:03:50.907
These'll do the trick for sure.

922
01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:55.610
Shepherd for Fairchild.

923
01:03:58.014 --> 01:04:00.315
<i>Listen. we're gonna
blow the lab.</i>

924
01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:05.922
Get out if you can.

925
01:04:12.995 --> 01:04:16.933
Bob...

926
01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:19.434
we either do this now.
or we don't do this at all.

927
01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:23.906
If we don't give
Mayweather a call back

928
01:04:23.973 --> 01:04:26.909
and give him the all clear.
he's gonna launch that nuke.

929
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:33.415
Look. we're gonna try to
get Fairchild out of there.

930
01:04:33.482 --> 01:04:36.785
Hey. but if we have to choose.

931
01:04:36.852 --> 01:04:38.921
it's the charges at all cost.

932
01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:40.789
All right. buddy?

933
01:04:40.856 --> 01:04:42.491
We're gonna take that thing out.
but we may have to go with it.

934
01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:45.660
Do you understand?

935
01:04:45.727 --> 01:04:47.729
Yeah.

936
01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:51.500
I should've stayed in
my hole under the ground.

937
01:04:51.566 --> 01:04:53.301
Careful what you wish for.

938
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.651
Oh. shit.

939
01:05:12.255 --> 01:05:13.855
It's in the morgue.

940
01:05:16.159 --> 01:05:17.726
<i>Do you copy?
It's in the morgue.</i>

941
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.464
You got it?

942
01:05:22.531 --> 01:05:23.665
Yeah. yeah.
Got it. got it. got it.

943
01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:03.072
Go. Go.

944
01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:04.539
Okay.

945
01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.543
Oh. God.
Oh my God.

946
01:06:12.315 --> 01:06:13.916
Ah!

947
01:06:15.318 --> 01:06:16.852
Shepherd!

948
01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:18.753
It's in the morgue.
it's in the morgue!

949
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.125
No. it's not!

950
01:06:23.192 --> 01:06:24.894
Move!

951
01:06:29.265 --> 01:06:30.532
Bob!

952
01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:32.667
I love you badass. Bob!

953
01:06:32.734 --> 01:06:34.603
Take the charge.
I'll cover you. hurry!

954
01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:38.473
It's still alive!

955
01:06:41.509 --> 01:06:42.945
Not for long!

956
01:06:43.012 --> 01:06:45.580
Go! Go! Go!

957
01:06:58.327 --> 01:06:59.661
Call Mayweather.

958
01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:01.830
He's already trying to call us.

959
01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:03.632
<i>There's a massive target
in your airspace!</i>

960
01:07:03.698 --> 01:07:05.500
<i>I'm sending in the
Air Force to support.</i>

961
01:07:13.842 --> 01:07:16.411
Oh. God.

962
01:07:16.478 --> 01:07:18.480
Now. what?

963
01:07:18.546 --> 01:07:20.917
<i>Command. we are on
approach to the alien craft.</i>

964
01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:23.019
<i>Stay frosty
up there. airmen.</i>

965
01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:25.054
<i>these slimy sons of bitches
dropped a boatload of monsters</i>

966
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:26.956
<i>on us today so they're
not here to ask for sugar.</i>

967
01:07:27.023 --> 01:07:29.125
<i>I need full sensors
on that saucer.</i>

968
01:07:29.191 --> 01:07:32.395
<i>Send everything you get
to our team on the ground.</i>

969
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.529
<i>Roger that. going for
a closer look.</i>

970
01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:41.503
<i>Jesus. look at
the size of that thing!</i>

971
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:43.571
<i>Sensors active.</i>

972
01:07:46.508 --> 01:07:47.977
<i>Signal live!</i>

973
01:07:51.013 --> 01:07:53.715
I'm picking up all kinds
of readings from that ship.

974
01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:56.118
It's scanning.

975
01:07:56.185 --> 01:07:59.521
It's looking for
the crashed ship.

976
01:07:59.587 --> 01:08:01.523
I thought they sent it here.

977
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:03.159
Think about it.

978
01:08:03.225 --> 01:08:04.894
All the monsters we faced today.

979
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:08.230
that isn't what you expect
from an intelligent species.

980
01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:09.631
If they wanted to kill us.

981
01:08:09.698 --> 01:08:11.833
they would've done
it a long time ago.

982
01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:16.504
That crashed ship was not
an attack. it was a prison...

983
01:08:16.571 --> 01:08:18.707
a prison for aliens
so dangerous

984
01:08:18.773 --> 01:08:20.675
they were rounded up
and launched into space.

985
01:08:20.742 --> 01:08:23.245
It was never
supposed to land here.

986
01:08:23.312 --> 01:08:24.846
What's it doing here now?

987
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:28.317
The same thing we're doing.

988
01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:29.952
Containment.

989
01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:31.954
It's their version
of the Helion Measure!

990
01:08:32.021 --> 01:08:33.688
But we killed all the aliens!

991
01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:35.590
Well. maybe we missed one?

992
01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.534
You hear that?

993
01:08:46.601 --> 01:08:48.270
It's gathering energy.

994
01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:49.604
It's charging.

995
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:50.973
Charging what?

996
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.708
Isn't it obvious?
It's a weapon.

997
01:08:59.415 --> 01:09:00.749
<i>Target is hostile!</i>

998
01:09:00.815 --> 01:09:02.650
<i>Repeat!
Target is hostile!</i>

999
01:09:05.454 --> 01:09:07.622
Oh. my God. Bob's right.

1000
01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:09.158
These power readings are
off the charts.

1001
01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:11.360
If the Air Force doesn't
take down the mothership

1002
01:09:11.427 --> 01:09:13.795
before it charges up. it could
destroy the whole planet.

1003
01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:15.864
You're telling me they're
the most advanced minds

1004
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:17.599
in the universe.
and they're gonna come here

1005
01:09:17.665 --> 01:09:21.971
and blow us up for
their mistake?

1006
01:09:22.038 --> 01:09:27.410
This is your mess and
we're cleaning it up!

1007
01:09:27.476 --> 01:09:29.744
Sir. the mothership has
engaged the Air Force.

1008
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:32.281
We're losing pilots.

1009
01:09:32.348 --> 01:09:34.283
Mora. if I asked you to
take an alien craft

1010
01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:36.551
and go get Shepherd and
his team to safety.

1011
01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:40.256
maybe even kick these ETs in
their ass while you're at it.

1012
01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:41.623
how fast could you get there?

1013
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.092
Extremely fast. sir.

1014
01:09:43.159 --> 01:09:44.559
Good. Do it.

1015
01:09:44.626 --> 01:09:46.861
Get our people to safety.
if you can.

1016
01:09:49.965 --> 01:09:52.634
<i>Multiple targets inbound.
weapons hot!</i>

1017
01:10:04.813 --> 01:10:06.949
What do you want from us?

1018
01:10:09.818 --> 01:10:12.154
Shepherd. come in.

1019
01:10:13.655 --> 01:10:14.957
Colonel. sir.

1020
01:10:15.024 --> 01:10:16.691
<i>We have a new threat.</i>

1021
01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.294
<i>I'm aware.</i>

1022
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.162
<i>I just sent evac coordinates
to Fairchild.</i>

1023
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:22.597
<i>You need to get there now.
You're done there.</i>

1024
01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:23.966
Negative. sir.

1025
01:10:25.767 --> 01:10:27.436
I'm sorry. Shepherd.

1026
01:10:27.503 --> 01:10:29.038
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

1027
01:10:29.105 --> 01:10:30.906
<i>There's no fighting that thing.</i>

1028
01:10:36.045 --> 01:10:38.813
There's only one
option left now.

1029
01:10:41.683 --> 01:10:44.386
We're targeting the craft.

1030
01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:45.620
Mayweather!

1031
01:10:46.855 --> 01:10:49.624
Five minutes to Helion impact.

1032
01:10:49.691 --> 01:10:50.993
Mayweather!

1033
01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:04.306
He launched the nuke.

1034
01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:08.577
He's got EVAC waiting for us.
but...

1035
01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:11.480
we've got five minutes.

1036
01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:14.116
Time to move.

1037
01:11:14.183 --> 01:11:15.918
Everybody's
answer to everything.

1038
01:11:15.985 --> 01:11:19.088
Nuke it. Nuke it.
Just nuke it.

1039
01:11:19.155 --> 01:11:20.688
You know what?

1040
01:11:20.755 --> 01:11:22.591
They mastered
interstellar travel

1041
01:11:22.657 --> 01:11:25.194
and you know what
we just fired at it?

1042
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:26.495
A firecracker.

1043
01:11:26.562 --> 01:11:28.497
Listen. smart boy. it's over.

1044
01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:30.698
It's time to go!

1045
01:11:31.967 --> 01:11:33.969
At least it's gonna be
a hell of a show.

1046
01:11:34.036 --> 01:11:35.437
I promise you it's not.

1047
01:11:35.504 --> 01:11:38.974
Bob. Wait. what do you
mean "it's not"?

1048
01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.376
Okay.

1049
01:11:42.378 --> 01:11:45.747
<i>Abort! Abort!
Helion is in bound.</i>

1050
01:11:45.813 --> 01:11:49.351
<i>I repeat. abort!
Get out of there! Now!</i>

1051
01:11:56.659 --> 01:11:59.195
Bob!
We need to go now.

1052
01:11:59.261 --> 01:12:00.663
I'm telling you.
it won't matter!

1053
01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:02.031
What do you mean?

1054
01:12:02.097 --> 01:12:03.765
That nuke might as well
be a paper plane

1055
01:12:03.831 --> 01:12:05.501
when it hits the shields
of that ship.

1056
01:12:05.568 --> 01:12:08.170
If we leave now. we'll still be
dead when that mothership fires.

1057
01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:10.973
along with everyone on Earth!

1058
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.474
How do you know this?

1059
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:15.311
I'm an expert!

1060
01:12:15.377 --> 01:12:16.478
I'm the expert.

1061
01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:17.880
I've studied every single ship

1062
01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:19.481
that's found its way
to our planet.

1063
01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:20.616
'51 was the first time they
showed up after Roswell.

1064
01:12:20.683 --> 01:12:21.917
No aggression.

1065
01:12:21.984 --> 01:12:23.652
They just wanted their
pilot back.

1066
01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.554
but they sure were scared of us
and we already had the nuke!

1067
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.056
In'77 shots were fired at us.

1068
01:12:27.122 --> 01:12:28.557
but we never landed
a hit on them.

1069
01:12:28.624 --> 01:12:31.360
We didn't know it then.
but same thing: shields.

1070
01:12:31.427 --> 01:12:35.064
'82 it was a crash landing
because the gravity well failed.

1071
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:38.133
Shepherd. you have
to trust me on this.

1072
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.069
I mean. it's one thing
to nuke a single alien

1073
01:12:40.135 --> 01:12:41.470
down here on the ground. right?

1074
01:12:41.537 --> 01:12:44.607
But that missile.
it won't even penetrate

1075
01:12:44.673 --> 01:12:46.308
the shields of that mothership.

1076
01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:52.814
Unless... unless we can fix it.

1077
01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:55.184
How?

1078
01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.419
You see the size of
that thing. right?

1079
01:12:57.486 --> 01:12:58.954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1080
01:12:59.021 --> 01:13:00.755
The only way it can maintain
its structural integrity

1081
01:13:00.822 --> 01:13:02.658
in our atmosphere
is anti-gravity.

1082
01:13:02.725 --> 01:13:07.496
The same as the Roswell craft.
the same as every other craft.

1083
01:13:07.563 --> 01:13:09.665
And the same as the gauntlet.

1084
01:13:09.732 --> 01:13:11.700
Shepherd. I have a plan.

1085
01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:13.469
Two birds. one stone.

1086
01:13:13.535 --> 01:13:16.771
Every one of those ships. it...
it manipulates. it...

1087
01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:18.641
it bends gravity
around it. right?

1088
01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:21.944
And it generates a
gravity well underneath it.

1089
01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:24.013
It's the weak spot.

1090
01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:26.615
Call Mayweather back. now!
Call Mayweather back!

1091
01:13:26.682 --> 01:13:27.716
Tell him to change the target.

1092
01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:29.451
The base. not the ship!

1093
01:13:29.518 --> 01:13:31.754
We'll redirect it
right up the gravity well.

1094
01:13:31.819 --> 01:13:35.691
How the hell are we gonna
redirect a nuke from down here?

1095
01:13:35.758 --> 01:13:36.791
We're gonna catch it!

1096
01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:38.227
How?

1097
01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:40.896
I'll tell you how.
I'll tell you.

1098
01:13:43.098 --> 01:13:45.134
With that and with this.

1099
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.069
The only way to make sure
we destroy that ship

1100
01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:50.973
is if we use the gravity
gauntlet from below it.

1101
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.375
But we have to stay here!

1102
01:13:53.442 --> 01:13:56.912
Oh my God. Bob.
I hope you're right.

1103
01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.381
Shepherd to Mayweather.

1104
01:13:59.448 --> 01:14:01.884
Shepherd. did you get
your team out of there?

1105
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.686
That's a negative. sir.

1106
01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:05.421
<i>You need to get out of there.</i>

1107
01:14:05.487 --> 01:14:08.157
He's right. Shepherd.
it's now or never!

1108
01:14:08.223 --> 01:14:10.825
Shepherd. you need to
get out of there now!

1109
01:14:10.893 --> 01:14:12.728
Shepherd. it's
already too late!

1110
01:14:12.795 --> 01:14:14.063
You gotta go!

1111
01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:15.764
We have it on good
authority this nuke

1112
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.733
is not gonna eliminate
the threat.

1113
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.535
What authority?

1114
01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:21.303
Science!

1115
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.772
The only one we've got
that knows anything

1116
01:14:23.838 --> 01:14:25.174
about alien technology.

1117
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.675
We need you
to redirect the Helion.

1118
01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:28.477
target the base not the ship.

1119
01:14:28.544 --> 01:14:30.079
You... you want it to miss?

1120
01:14:30.145 --> 01:14:34.683
No. no. We want it to hit.
but my team has a plan.

1121
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.053
We're gonna... we're gonna
redirect the shot.

1122
01:14:40.556 --> 01:14:42.758
Please. sir. you have
to trust us.

1123
01:14:42.825 --> 01:14:44.960
<i>The only way
to make sure we kill that ship</i>

1124
01:14:45.027 --> 01:14:46.428
<i>is to hit it from below.</i>

1125
01:14:46.495 --> 01:14:48.497
We were able to test
the method earlier.

1126
01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:51.700
We have an alien weapon
that will work. we just...

1127
01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:55.971
we've gotta stay down here
to redirect the nuke.

1128
01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:01.143
Colonel?

1129
01:15:02.678 --> 01:15:04.113
Sir?

1130
01:15:04.179 --> 01:15:07.082
Shepherd. if I do this...

1131
01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.222
there's no going back.

1132
01:15:13.288 --> 01:15:15.724
You understand that. right?

1133
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.925
So. I'm gonna ask you again.

1134
01:15:19.395 --> 01:15:23.532
Are you sure?

1135
01:15:26.135 --> 01:15:28.437
Yes. sir. I am sure.

1136
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.676
Changing the missile
trajectory now.

1137
01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:37.312
See you in five.

1138
01:15:49.658 --> 01:15:51.960
We're gonna give
those three-fingered freaks

1139
01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:54.463
a taste of their own medicine.

1140
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.065
We're gonna give them
a spanking with gravity.

1141
01:15:57.132 --> 01:16:02.671
and we're gonna show them you
do not blast the planet Earth!

1142
01:16:02.738 --> 01:16:04.473
- Bob. no!
- Bob!

1143
01:16:09.478 --> 01:16:11.146
It's heading into the warehouse!

1144
01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:13.949
It's gotta go back
into the dark.

1145
01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:15.484
Well. at least it's contained.

1146
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:17.119
For now.

1147
01:16:17.186 --> 01:16:19.321
Shepherd. we need the
power supply that thing

1148
01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:22.624
just swallowed in order to
make the gauntlet work.

1149
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:24.193
Let's go get it.

1150
01:16:34.203 --> 01:16:36.071
Does that thing work?

1151
01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.040
It needs power.

1152
01:16:38.106 --> 01:16:39.508
I could run a line
from the grid.

1153
01:16:39.575 --> 01:16:40.676
Go get it.

1154
01:16:45.214 --> 01:16:47.816
Oh. shit.
I'll distract him.

1155
01:16:47.884 --> 01:16:50.887
Hey! Hey!

1156
01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:51.987
Go.

1157
01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:54.924
Hey!
Hey. over here!

1158
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.458
Hey!

1159
01:17:02.899 --> 01:17:04.233
Ugh.

1160
01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:15.377
Where is it. Bob?

1161
01:17:33.695 --> 01:17:35.564
Oh!

1162
01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:42.137
Oh. shit.

1163
01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.640
Hey. Stella!

1164
01:17:46.642 --> 01:17:47.911
Shepherd!

1165
01:17:47.977 --> 01:17:50.512
Hold on! Shepherd!

1166
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:55.784
Hey! Hey!

1167
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:58.153
Hey! Hey!
You hungry?

1168
01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.958
Hungry?

1169
01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.325
Eat this!

1170
01:18:14.169 --> 01:18:15.571
Shepherd. are you okay?

1171
01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:17.072
- Oh. God
- Shepherd. are you okay?

1172
01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:18.173
You okay?

1173
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.608
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1174
01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:20.910
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1175
01:18:20.977 --> 01:18:22.244
The nuke's coming. Shepherd.

1176
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:24.914
The nuke's coming.

1177
01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:26.114
Look!

1178
01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:31.620
Oh. my God.

1179
01:18:40.562 --> 01:18:42.564
Is that what I think it is?

1180
01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:44.099
The power cell.

1181
01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:45.300
Okay. Bob.

1182
01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:49.304
This one's for you.

1183
01:18:50.839 --> 01:18:52.641
Ah!

1184
01:18:59.681 --> 01:19:00.816
Gah! I got it!

1185
01:19:00.883 --> 01:19:02.584
They're shooting at the nuke!
Hurry!

1186
01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:04.586
I don't got it.
I need help!

1187
01:19:07.522 --> 01:19:08.891
<i>Scramble! Scramble!</i>

1188
01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:10.459
<i>Negative. airmen!</i>

1189
01:19:10.525 --> 01:19:13.161
<i>New orders are protect
that nuke at all costs!</i>

1190
01:19:14.897 --> 01:19:17.866
Come on. Shepherd!
That ship's about to fire!

1191
01:19:17.934 --> 01:19:20.535
Okay.

1192
01:19:20.602 --> 01:19:22.571
How are we supposed
to fight these things?

1193
01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:25.407
We've got one of their ships!
Just keep them off that bomb!

1194
01:19:27.376 --> 01:19:28.777
<i>Got a bogie on the payload!</i>

1195
01:19:28.844 --> 01:19:30.980
<i>Keep 'em off me!</i>

1196
01:19:31.047 --> 01:19:32.381
<i>Got one!
You're clear!</i>

1197
01:19:32.447 --> 01:19:35.484
<i>Firing on target!</i>

1198
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:39.488
<i>Mora to ground team.
you're all clear up here.</i>

1199
01:19:39.554 --> 01:19:40.756
<i>Go ahead and say hi!</i>

1200
01:20:15.657 --> 01:20:17.392
It worked.

1201
01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:20.495
Oh. Bob. it worked!

1202
01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:26.735
Oh. man.

1203
01:20:26.802 --> 01:20:29.105
Oh. whoo!

1204
01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:31.941
Whoo!

1205
01:20:32.008 --> 01:20:33.475
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:20:36.012 --> 01:20:37.412
Oh.

1207
01:21:06.142 --> 01:21:07.442
Wow.

1208
01:21:17.319 --> 01:21:18.955
- Bob!
- Bob?

1209
01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:20.789
Big idiot forgot to chew.

1210
01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:25.527
I've been digested.

1211
01:21:30.265 --> 01:21:32.634
And almost disintegrated.

1212
01:21:34.703 --> 01:21:36.872
Bob. your plan worked.

1213
01:21:38.975 --> 01:21:39.942
Imagine that.

1214
01:21:42.245 --> 01:21:44.080
Mayweather's gonna be pissed.

1215
01:21:44.147 --> 01:21:47.716
No. Why would he be pissed?
You just saved the planet.

1216
01:21:47.783 --> 01:21:50.352
You think we're gonna
get any more funding?

1217
01:21:50.418 --> 01:21:52.687
We have to for next time.

1218
01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:54.456
If this is what they do
for a missing ship.

1219
01:21:54.523 --> 01:21:56.092
imagine what happens next.

1220
01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:58.727
Oh. God. I don't want to.
I don't want to imagine.

1221
01:21:58.794 --> 01:22:00.462
Yeah. Well. unfortunately
it's our job

1222
01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:02.198
to imagine what happens next.

1223
01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:05.101
and to be better
prepared for it

1224
01:22:05.168 --> 01:22:09.838
because I'm never
leaving my workshop again.

1225
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.943
Not bad for day one.

1226
01:22:19.115 --> 01:22:20.348
Come in peace...

1227
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.519
or go in pieces!

1228
01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:29.858
Hey!

1229
01:22:29.926 --> 01:22:32.161
Hell of a welcoming
party here. Shepherd.

1230
01:22:32.228 --> 01:22:33.562
Nice shot. too.

1231
01:22:33.628 --> 01:22:35.730
- How you doing over there?
- Doing swell.

1232
01:22:40.236 --> 01:22:41.904
How'd you get here so fast?

1233
01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:45.407
Well. after you hit
the bull's-eye. I. uh.

1234
01:22:45.473 --> 01:22:47.409
hopped a flight here with.
uh. Agent Mora.

1235
01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:49.578
She was. uh. nice enough
to kind of let me hop on

1236
01:22:49.644 --> 01:22:51.147
the fastest ship we got
in the galaxy.

1237
01:22:51.214 --> 01:22:54.183
I know that ship!
It's the Roswell craft!

1238
01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:57.385
Wait. that's my ship.

1239
01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.024
That's the government's ship.
asshole.

1240
01:23:02.091 --> 01:23:05.261
but if you ask real nice.
I think Agent Mora here

1241
01:23:05.328 --> 01:23:07.897
just might. you know.
give you a spin.

1242
01:23:09.065 --> 01:23:12.335
Hey. Fairchild.
I'm very impressed.

1243
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.006
Nice job. and I can't wait
to have you take over here.

1244
01:23:17.073 --> 01:23:18.107
Yeah.

1245
01:23:18.174 --> 01:23:20.076
Hey. Shepherd?

1246
01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:21.543
Yes. sir?

1247
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.511
I said a welcoming party.

1248
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.682
not a retirement party.

1249
01:23:29.151 --> 01:23:30.086
Look around you.

1250
01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:33.455
You got it. sir.

1251
01:23:34.756 --> 01:23:36.225
This is gonna be nice.

1252
01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:38.593
I got a feeling we're
gonna be here for awhile.

1253
01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:49.437
We're gonna be here for awhile.
