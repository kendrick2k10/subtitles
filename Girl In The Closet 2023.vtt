3
00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:27.636
Where do you think
you're going. huh?

4
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.550
Where do you think you're going?

5
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.467
Where do you think
you're going. huh?

6
00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.382
- No!
- Get up!

7
00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:37.124
I don't wanna do it anymore!
Please--

8
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.137
Please don't make me.

9
00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:52.269
Please don't make me.

10
00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:53.879
Please...

11
00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:15.727
Mm!

12
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.994
Hey. I'm glad you
guys could make it.

13
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.908
You enjoying yourselves?

14
00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.521
It's plenty more
where that came from.

15
00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.393
Who's winning?

16
00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:30.786
What do you mean
who's winning?

17
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.744
Brian and I got this on lock!

18
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:34.398
Three games in a row!

19
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:35.834
Renee. God don't
like no braggart.

20
00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:37.271
You know what?

21
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.011
If God was this
as good at Spades.

22
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:40.274
he'd brag too.

23
00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:43.494
Well. we need to
switch it up after this.

24
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:44.930
Tired of getting
your butt whipped?

25
00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:46.149
Tired of seeing your ugly face.

26
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:52.676
What. is it happening again?

27
00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:54.462
A couple of times a day.

28
00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.942
I told you to go see
somebody about that.

29
00:01:57.073 --> 00:02:00.511
Mm. I ain't got no time to be
waitin' all day in urgent care.

30
00:02:00.598 --> 00:02:02.731
Just a couple of aspirin.
and I'll be good as new.

31
00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:04.254
Hey!

32
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.082
Hey. enjoynig
your birthday. baby?

33
00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:08.084
-It's the best one ever.
-Yeah?

34
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.086
You guys go wash your hands.
We're gonna cut the cake soon.

35
00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:11.218
Yeah?

36
00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:13.133
Mmkay. Mmkay.

37
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.315
Mia?

38
00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:24.056
What?

39
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.233
No. that's not nece--

40
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.235
Mm. mm.

41
00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:30.019
Okay.

42
00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:33.022
Huh. yeah.

43
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.284
Bye.

44
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.508
Who told her?

45
00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:43.815
Why?

46
00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:45.600
She's her aunt!

47
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.864
She's not welcome here.
and you know that.

48
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:50.213
I told you.

49
00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.084
You knew?

50
00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:54.391
I don't understand why
you guys hate her so much.

51
00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.437
You didn't have to
grow up with her.

52
00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:59.483
It's not my fault Grandma didn't
have enough room for all of us.

53
00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.529
I just don't understand
why you guys hate her so much.

54
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:07.709
Yes. she did kill a person.

55
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.146
But he was beating on Venus.

56
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:12.192
I don't condone
what she did. but...

57
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:13.976
I'm not gonna
hold it against her.

58
00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:15.717
That is not it.
Mia Ann is--

59
00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:22.376
She's here.

60
00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:27.294
What did I do?

61
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:28.904
Just play.

62
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.866
You got a lot of
nerve showing up here.

63
00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:36.607
Don't talk to my mom like that.

64
00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:38.087
Uh. it's okay. baby.

65
00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:40.524
Just go get the
things out the back.

66
00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:43.788
Why so much venom to
someone bearing gifts?

67
00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:46.313
I told you. I don't
need anything from you.

68
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.663
Oh. all of a sudden?

69
00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:51.361
Because when your heat was off
and your funds was low.

70
00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.320
my money was good
enough for you then.

71
00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.147
That's because it
involved Cameron.

72
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.498
Didn't want her freezing.

73
00:03:57.585 --> 00:04:00.501
And just like then. I'm
here for Cameron again.

74
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:02.938
Where should I put this?

75
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.548
Back in the truck.
'cause you're not staying.

76
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.898
Oh!

77
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:10.467
I see you invited the others.

78
00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:11.599
They're her family.

79
00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:13.253
I'm her family.

80
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.124
I love her too.

81
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.257
I mean. nobody's
perfect. Patricia.

82
00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:19.259
And you let her stay with Renee.

83
00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.608
and she got a different man
at her house every week!

84
00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:23.480
And Brian?

85
00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.701
He can't think his way out
a paper bag. he's so dumb.

86
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.269
The only one who don't
give me problems is Yoyo.

87
00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:31.575
That's because she lived
with Grandma after Mom died.

88
00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:32.663
Well. you could've
moved in with her.

89
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.796
No. I couldn't!

90
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:37.668
She already had seven of us
in her two-bedroom house.

91
00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.802
The rest of us had to
stay with Venus and you.

92
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.499
Yolanda don't know
what you forced us

93
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.674
to do to each other.

94
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.284
We were kids!

95
00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:47.852
We were stupid!
Now we gotta move on!

96
00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:49.463
You were
supposed to take care of us!

97
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.596
I am not here to fight.

98
00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:55.991
I came here so that my niece
can have a memorable birthday.

99
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:58.298
Auntie Mia?

100
00:04:58.385 --> 00:04:59.951
Hi. baby.

101
00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:01.736
Are those for me?

102
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.303
Of course they are.

103
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.174
and I got something
else for you too.

104
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.220
Wow!

105
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.441
Cam Cam. give back the money.

106
00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:12.790
But...

107
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:14.314
Give the money back.

108
00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:16.011
Go play with your friends.

109
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:17.839
What about my gifts?

110
00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:21.408
The adults are talking.
Go on. now.

111
00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:22.670
Yes. ma'am.

112
00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:32.027
Now. take your gifts and
your tired-ass daughter--

113
00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:33.724
Excuse me?

114
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:37.772
--back to your SUV and
get the hell out of here.

115
00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:41.036
People change.

116
00:05:41.123 --> 00:05:43.081
Isn't that what you
read in your Bible?

117
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.779
Forgiveness?

118
00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:46.171
God forgives.

119
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.699
I ain't God.

120
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:55.703
Patricia...

121
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.054
I love you. sis.

122
00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:07.062
Come on with the damn bike.

123
00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:14.939
If you just gonna
sit there and be angry.

124
00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:16.854
you could go to your room.

125
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.161
Why couldn't I keep the gifts?

126
00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:22.294
When it comes to your auntie.
things are complicated.

127
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:24.471
But it was $40!

128
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:27.952
Baby. not all money...

129
00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:29.476
is good money.

130
00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:31.216
I don't understand.

131
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:34.176
How can I explain this?

132
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:40.748
Okay. in the Bible.

133
00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:46.928
it says that money
is a protection.

134
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:52.499
It can be used to pay for things
we need. like food and clothes.

135
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:54.065
Or the doll I was gonna
buy with the money.

136
00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:58.896
Yes. or the doll.

137
00:06:58.983 --> 00:07:03.379
But sometimes. people get
money by doing bad things.

138
00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:05.468
by hurting others.

139
00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.297
Aunt Mia's family.
She would never hurt me.

140
00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:13.345
Unfortunately. sometimes
the ones that hurt us the most

141
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.086
are family.

142
00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:16.784
Did she hurt you?

143
00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:20.527
Come here.

144
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:25.445
Listen.

145
00:07:25.575 --> 00:07:27.969
I know you're upset about today.

146
00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.015
But I did what's best for us.

147
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:34.366
And I promise. next
year. your birthday

148
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:39.981
is gonna be even better
than this one. okay?

149
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:43.506
Now. let's clean this up
and get ready for bed.

150
00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:45.334
'cause we have a lot
to be thankful for.

151
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.643
And forgive us our debts

152
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:52.384
as we have also
forgiven our debtors.

153
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.604
and do not bring us
into temptation.

154
00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.650
but deliver us from
the wicked one.

155
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.174
In Jesus' name we pray. amen.

156
00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:00.741
Amen.

157
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:11.795
Mom?

158
00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:12.709
Yes. baby.

159
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.755
Where's God?

160
00:08:14.842 --> 00:08:17.235
Mm. well...

161
00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:19.455
God is omnipresent.

162
00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:21.979
Do you know what that means?

163
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:27.507
It means that he

164
00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:32.294
is everywhere at all times.

165
00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:35.515
-Even now?
-Mmhmm. yes.

166
00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:37.952
Even now.

167
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.911
I bet that's pretty hard
for you to imagine. huh?

168
00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:46.482
Can you name something
that you can see?

169
00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:48.179
There's a lot of trees outside.

170
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:50.094
Yes.

171
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:52.444
Well. from now on.

172
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:54.795
whenever you see a tree.

173
00:08:54.925 --> 00:08:57.275
let that be a reminder

174
00:08:57.362 --> 00:09:00.322
that you are never alone.

175
00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:01.802
God is with you.

176
00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:04.065
Okay?

177
00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:06.546
Okay.
Go to bed.

178
00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:23.519
What's for breakfast?

179
00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:25.434
Oatmeal.

180
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.832
Do we have any sugar or butter?

181
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.834
No. we're all out.

182
00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:35.400
There's syrup if you
want to sweeten it up.

183
00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:39.230
I know you're sick of it.

184
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.146
but it's all we have today.

185
00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:43.713
And we're thankful for it.

186
00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:48.196
Grace!

187
00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:51.460
Milk...

188
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:54.985
-Mama?
-Yes. baby?

189
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:56.552
You can use the money
I got for my birthday

190
00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.119
to buy something
else for breakfast.

191
00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:01.165
Aren't you generous?

192
00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:03.733
Won't be necessary.

193
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.908
Eat your meal.

194
00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:11.349
Mama!

195
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.395
Mama. please. wake up!

196
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:14.701
Mama!

197
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:16.093
Mama. wake up!

198
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.573
Please!

199
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.835
Mama!

200
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:20.794
Wake up!

201
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.883
A damn aneurysm.

202
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.711
I told her
to go see a doctor.

203
00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:25.929
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

204
00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:27.844
I'm just sayin'.

205
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.803
she's been complaining about
her head for weeks now.

206
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.239
No one ever listens to me.

207
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.414
Uh-huh!

208
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:33.545
Yeah!

209
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.330
No. I can take her.

210
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.549
For sure.

211
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.074
You missed a spot.

212
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:44.121
Come on. now. Renee!
I said it's not a problem!

213
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.863
Yeah. that's my niece.
and I will take her.

214
00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:48.517
Okay.

215
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.650
O-O-Okay.

216
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.564
Yeah. just let me
know what time.

217
00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:54.741
Okay. all right. baby.

218
00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:57.482
Okay. talk to you soon.

219
00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:59.180
Is it positive?

220
00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:01.182
I don't know.
I can't tell.

221
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:02.749
Well. you got any more?

222
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:04.098
That was the last one.

223
00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.710
Oh. you are such an idiot!

224
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:09.494
Clean up this mess!

225
00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:11.714
Whatever...

226
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:13.237
What you say?

227
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.851
No. I think I heard
you say something.

228
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.113
Didn't you hear
her say something. Chris?

229
00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:20.462
Yeah. I heard her say something.

230
00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:22.203
I just couldn't
make out what she said.

231
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:25.162
I think she
done forgot who I am.

232
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:27.469
But I'm sure about to
remind you.

233
00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:28.557
Bring her to the
kitchen. please.

234
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.037
No. no. no.

235
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.691
No.

236
00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:41.222
Are you serious?

237
00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:43.224
I got enough on
my plate already.

238
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:45.661
Please tell me these
are not for today!

239
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:48.708
They sure are!
You have an hour.

240
00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:49.839
What...

241
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:50.797
- Hey. Gail!
- Ugh...

242
00:11:50.884 --> 00:11:52.537
- Gail!
- Josh...

243
00:11:52.624 --> 00:11:54.365
- Hey. there.
- Mmhmm...

244
00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.453
Oof!

245
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.891
Wow. you look. uh. rough.

246
00:11:58.021 --> 00:11:59.588
Yeah. listen. I need a favor.

247
00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:01.503
Yeah. no. you're
all out of those.

248
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:03.157
No. listen. listen. Gail. look.

249
00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:05.463
You already know I'm skating
on thin ice with Rob. right?

250
00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:07.683
If. if I show up to court
lookin' like this. it's a wrap.

251
00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:09.119
Yeah. well. you know what?

252
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:10.817
While you were out
on maternity leave.

253
00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:12.644
I covered for you.

254
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:14.385
You're back. I'm done.

255
00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:15.517
But these are the easy ones.

256
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:16.997
I've already done
most of the work.

257
00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:18.172
Most of the work. huh?

258
00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:20.304
So easy.

259
00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:21.262
Fine.

260
00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:22.132
Thank you.

261
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:23.351
Gosh!

262
00:12:23.438 --> 00:12:25.092
Look...

263
00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:28.051
All right. what we got?

264
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:29.836
You reviewed Mia's profile?

265
00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:31.576
Yes.

266
00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:33.100
And done all the background
research on the case?

267
00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:35.537
Yes. yes. of course!

268
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.626
All good. right?
It's so easy.

269
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.194
Fine! Again.

270
00:12:40.324 --> 00:12:42.065
But you know this classifies
as a baby shower gift. right?

271
00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:43.501
- Noted!
- Yeah. noted.

272
00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:45.415
- Yes! You're the best.
- Josh. god!

273
00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:47.549
- Love you!
- Yeah. whatever!

274
00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:01.737
What are you doing here?

275
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:04.784
Happy to see you awake.

276
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.048
Good. water.

277
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:12.879
You got it?

278
00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:16.796
I brought a present for you.

279
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.235
Mama!

280
00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:24.325
How's my baby?

281
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:26.022
Mm...

282
00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:27.328
I'm good.

283
00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:28.416
I miss you.

284
00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:29.939
I miss you too.

285
00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:33.769
How long I was out for?

286
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.379
Right around three--

287
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.773
-Days?
-Weeks.

288
00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:39.688
My god. I gotta get outta here.

289
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.909
Wait a minute. now.

290
00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:46.173
See. the doctor said
you need to take it easy.

291
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.002
No stress. no sudden movements.

292
00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:50.830
The best thing
for you is to rest.

293
00:13:53.223 --> 00:13:55.095
What's best for me
is that I go home

294
00:13:55.182 --> 00:13:56.792
and take care of my baby.

295
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.925
Cam's all right.

296
00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.188
Gave her lunch money.
bought her some clothes.

297
00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:03.581
'cause that girl's
growing like a weed.

298
00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:07.629
Like I told you. sis.

299
00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:11.459
I love you.
and I love my niece.

300
00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:14.331
Why don't you just
let her stay with me?

301
00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:18.683
And I'll keep bringing her
here to visit you every day.

302
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.295
even when you get home.

303
00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:23.340
And then when you're
ready and feeling better.

304
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:25.952
she can come home to you.

305
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.087
Guess you was right. huh?

306
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:33.220
People can change.

307
00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:39.790
All right.

308
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:42.620
She can stay with you...

309
00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:46.146
until I'm feeling better.

310
00:14:46.276 --> 00:14:49.453
You're doing the right thing.

311
00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:52.152
I'mma let y'all two
spend some time together.

312
00:14:56.286 --> 00:15:00.029
-Mia?
-Hm?

313
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:02.423
Thank you.

314
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:11.998
Hi.

315
00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:13.608
Josh Goodman. please?

316
00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:17.960
Dang. where they at?

317
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:19.831
It's taking forever.

318
00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:22.182
Hey. give me some forks.

319
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:31.974
Does this look
like a fork to you?

320
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:33.976
Just stupid.

321
00:15:34.063 --> 00:15:35.543
Yo. Angela. you ain't gotta
do the woman like that.

322
00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:36.718
You know she ain't all there.

323
00:15:36.805 --> 00:15:38.676
Shut up.

324
00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:40.156
- Girl...
- Ooh!

325
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:41.723
- Hey. babe.
- Hey. babe.

326
00:15:41.853 --> 00:15:43.638
I hope y'all got
that food going.

327
00:15:43.768 --> 00:15:45.814
'cause I'm starvin'!

328
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.858
Hey. little Cameron.
How you doin'?

329
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.512
Hi.

330
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.124
You remember your
uncle Chris. don't ya?

331
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:53.517
Huh. it's okay.

332
00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:56.129
I don't come around the family
as much as I'd like to.

333
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:58.305
That's because my
mama won't let you.

334
00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.697
Why don't you make
yourself useful

335
00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:02.135
and go take care of that
crying baby of yours?

336
00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:03.527
How about that?

337
00:16:06.704 --> 00:16:08.968
Cameron. your aunt and I.
we got you a gift.

338
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.797
Are you sure I can have it?

339
00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:15.104
Of course you can have it.

340
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:18.238
because your auntie Mia
is taking care of you now.

341
00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:23.373
-She's beautiful!
-Just like you.

342
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.767
I'm gonna call her Hannah.
like the woman in the Bible.

343
00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:28.639
Mm!

344
00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:31.120
That's Nancy.
She's the maid.

345
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.079
You got a maid?

346
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.515
Of course I do!

347
00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:36.691
All boss ladies do.

348
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:41.261
What
happened to your arm?

349
00:16:41.348 --> 00:16:45.308
She burned it on some
hot grease cookin' chicken.

350
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:47.789
Nancy. would you take
Cameron to her room. please?

351
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.151
Thank you.

352
00:17:17.862 --> 00:17:19.255
Down there?

353
00:17:19.342 --> 00:17:21.910
Yup! You'll be fine.
It's okay.

354
00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:26.132
I don't like the dark.

355
00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:28.047
Can you turn on a light?

356
00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:30.571
I'm scared of the dark!

357
00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:32.225
Shut up!
There's a window right there.

358
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:33.226
No! No!

359
00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:36.403
-Shh!
-No! No! No! No!

360
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.146
-Cameron. stop!
-No! No! No!

361
00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.495
-Sit down.
-No!

362
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:43.845
Cameron. stop!
I said stop. girl!

363
00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:45.325
Stop!

364
00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:46.717
Let me go.

365
00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:49.677
What you lookin' at?

366
00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:59.426
Uncle Chris.
please don't leave me here!

367
00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:01.819
Please! Please!
I'm scared!

368
00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:03.604
Please don't leave me here!

369
00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:05.475
-Please. I'm scared!
-Cameron...

370
00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:08.130
-Aunt Mia!
-Cameron...

371
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:10.480
It ain't no use in
yellin' and screamin'. baby.

372
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:12.308
Nobody can hear you.

373
00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:13.744
Aunt Mia!

374
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:16.007
Aunt Mia!

375
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:18.358
Aunt Mia. I'm scared!

376
00:18:18.488 --> 00:18:20.316
Aunt Mia. please!

377
00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:22.579
Cameron...

378
00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:26.105
Believe me.
It won't help.

379
00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:28.803
Come.

380
00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:35.940
It's okay.

381
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:42.860
This is your home now.

382
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:54.002
Come on out.

383
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.492
-Is this the niece?
-Her name is Cameron.

384
00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:08.799
Hi. Cameron.

385
00:19:08.886 --> 00:19:10.366
That's just
Joanne and Harlen.

386
00:19:10.453 --> 00:19:11.933
They harmless.

387
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.848
You don't have to
worry about them.

388
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:17.112
What you got there?

389
00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:20.333
Let her be.
She's still in shock.

390
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.206
Well. that's where you'll sleep.

391
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.208
I made some chicken earlier.
I put some to the side for you.

392
00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:27.949
You hungry?

393
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:30.256
How come you ain't put
nothin' to the side for me?

394
00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:31.779
Hush. she's...

395
00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:33.824
She's our guest.

396
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:37.480
I'll get you something later.

397
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:41.005
And no matter what.
you never go behind here. okay?

398
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:42.311
You understand?

399
00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:44.574
No matter what happens.

400
00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:46.750
Good.

401
00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:48.752
Now. no matter
how thirsty you get.

402
00:19:48.883 --> 00:19:50.319
don't drink the
Kool-Aid they give you.

403
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.582
They put something in
it to make you sleepy.

404
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:54.323
What should I drink. then?

405
00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.892
Anything else but that.

406
00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:02.157
Use the bathroom over there.

407
00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:03.854
It gets pretty cold
down here at night.

408
00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:08.119
so I'ma let you use my
blanket. but just for tonight.

409
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.817
Don't get used to it.

410
00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:12.472
I don't wanna catch pneumonia.

411
00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:14.213
How long do you think
I'll have to stay down here?

412
00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:19.348
Until Mia say it's enough.

413
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:54.992
Our Father
in the heavens.

414
00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:56.646
let Your name be sanctified.

415
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.872
Let Your kingdom come.

416
00:21:05.002 --> 00:21:06.874
Let Your will take place

417
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:11.139
as in Heaven. also on earth.

418
00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:21.149
Give us today our
bread for this day.

419
00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:25.371
and forgive us our debts as we
have also forgiven our debtors.

420
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.927
But deliver
us from the wicked one.

421
00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:01.972
In Jesus' name. amen.

422
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:13.201
I've been calling y'all
for almost a year

423
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:14.681
about my daughter.

424
00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:17.510
And you have every right
to voice your concern.

425
00:22:17.597 --> 00:22:19.163
We will do everything we can

426
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.296
to establish communication
with Ms. Smith.

427
00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:23.080
Has anyone gone to the house?

428
00:22:23.211 --> 00:22:24.908
We make periodic checks. yes.

429
00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:26.432
Liar!

430
00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:27.824
My sister stopped by

431
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:29.304
and some Spanish
people live there now.

432
00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:31.306
You guys are not
doing your jobs.

433
00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:34.918
Look. you approved your
daughter staying with Mia.

434
00:22:35.005 --> 00:22:36.355
Okay. wait a minute.

435
00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:38.182
Are you blaming
my sister for this?

436
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:40.097
Huh?

437
00:22:40.184 --> 00:22:41.708
How was I supposed to know
she'd stop taking my calls?

438
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:44.275
Listen. I'm not
blaming anyone. okay?

439
00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:46.452
I-I'm simply saying we
cannot be held accountable

440
00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.368
for something we didn't know.

441
00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:52.980
It's...

442
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.025
It's been a year.

443
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:57.550
And you're just now
coming to us.

444
00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.031
I...

445
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:04.513
If you had been doing your job.

446
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.038
I wouldn't be needing
to come to you now.

447
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:11.694
I thought she was in good hands.

448
00:23:11.781 --> 00:23:13.914
I thought Mia had changed
since she'd gotten out of jail.

449
00:23:14.001 --> 00:23:15.002
It's okay.

450
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:17.961
Are you gonna help me
get my child back or not?

451
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:22.792
Um...

452
00:23:22.923 --> 00:23:28.624
Ms. Smith. I'm truly sorry
for this...situation.

453
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:31.192
I'll--I'll send the police
to all the addresses

454
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.150
that we have on file for Mia.

455
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.326
While we do that.

456
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:38.286
please continue to contact
everyone that you know

457
00:23:38.373 --> 00:23:41.855
to see if you can
find out anything. okay?

458
00:23:41.985 --> 00:23:45.206
And you report it to me.

459
00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:49.253
Here's. um...my direct number.

460
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.604
Please call it at any time.

461
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:00.743
Please help me find my baby.

462
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.311
I'll do everything in my power.

463
00:24:06.532 --> 00:24:08.403
Get Thomas to sleep?

464
00:24:08.534 --> 00:24:10.536
Good luck with that.
If you can get him down.

465
00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:12.538
I can take a long lunch.

466
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.104
maybe head on over?

467
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:15.802
Huh?

468
00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:18.152
Maybe I can handle
a little bit of. uh. uh...

469
00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:19.196
Let me call you back.

470
00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:21.590
That's your easy file!

471
00:24:21.721 --> 00:24:25.202
Mia Smith. jailed for
beating a man with a hammer.

472
00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:28.031
trapping him inside the closet.
and starving him to death!

473
00:24:28.162 --> 00:24:30.164
You said you vetted her.

474
00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:32.383
You told me that you'd
been to the house. Josh!

475
00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:34.037
I drove past it!

476
00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:35.735
Are you kidding me?

477
00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:37.737
Come on. you know
we're swamped around here.

478
00:24:37.824 --> 00:24:39.478
It's impossible to
handle all this casework.

479
00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:42.045
Now a little girl's
life is at stake.

480
00:24:42.132 --> 00:24:44.657
and all you needed to do
was type on your computer

481
00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:46.789
and pull up Mia's record.

482
00:24:46.876 --> 00:24:49.226
It took me all of. what?
15 minutes?

483
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:52.229
-Okay. I'll stop by the house.
-You damn right you will!

484
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.319
'Cause I'm not taking the
fall for you on this one.

485
00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.844
So if you want
your wife and child

486
00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:02.283
to have an employable father.
you handle this.

487
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.414
- Okay. okay...
- Today!

488
00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:04.677
Okay!

489
00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:10.160
Yes. hi. I need the
address of a Mia Smith?

490
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:12.815
Mia Smith.

491
00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:24.044
You have my checks?

492
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:26.525
-Angela.
-Chris. Excuse me.

493
00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:32.269
Nancy still ain't get
her disability check.

494
00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:34.271
You probably gonna have to
take her down to the office.

495
00:25:34.358 --> 00:25:37.666
No. it's too risky.

496
00:25:37.797 --> 00:25:39.842
I'll figure something else out.

497
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:42.932
In the meantime. I'll get her
some work outside the house.

498
00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:45.239
Unless she knows more than
one way to skin a cat.

499
00:25:45.326 --> 00:25:48.155
Okay. 'cause nobody gets
a free ride living here.

500
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:50.461
Chris stopped getting
disability checks a year ago.

501
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.507
right after he married you.

502
00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:53.552
He gettin' a free ride.

503
00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:56.598
You must have forgotten.

504
00:25:56.685 --> 00:25:57.904
I was the only one that
hold your mama down

505
00:25:58.034 --> 00:26:00.689
when she was in jail.
Trippin'.

506
00:26:00.776 --> 00:26:03.910
He did. I gotta give him that.

507
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.739
I mean. we still getting checks
from Nancy and Joanne's kids

508
00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:08.305
and the custody check from
Cameron.

509
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:11.091
so we're gonna be
nice for a while.

510
00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:12.222
-Okay.
-Smoke and relax.

511
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.355
Ugh.

512
00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:25.279
It's some white man.

513
00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:36.116
I ain't expectin' nobody.

514
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:38.335
What you want me to do?

515
00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:40.511
Get rid of him?

516
00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:52.349
Hi. uh. I'm Josh Goodman

517
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.395
from the Department
of Health Services.

518
00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:57.311
-Are you Mia Smith?
-I am.

519
00:26:57.441 --> 00:27:00.531
Great. uh. I'm here to check up
on your niece. Cameron Smith.

520
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:03.578
-Uh. what about her?
-Is she here?

521
00:27:03.709 --> 00:27:05.536
It's a man. He...

522
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.016
He askin' about Cameron.

523
00:27:07.147 --> 00:27:09.453
No. she's at school.

524
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.630
School?
It's almost 5 o'clock.

525
00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:13.936
Yeah. she's in a
after school program.

526
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:16.112
-Dance.
-Okay. okay.

527
00:27:16.199 --> 00:27:18.027
Well. uh. I can just come in
and take a look around--

528
00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:19.942
Well. no.

529
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:21.378
You know. the place is a mess

530
00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:24.077
and my niece isn't here.

531
00:27:24.164 --> 00:27:28.081
So why don't you try
coming back tomorrow?

532
00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:30.257
Well. I could just--
I could just do it right now.

533
00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:33.042
No. you probably should be goin'

534
00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:36.567
'cause it gets dark pretty
fast around here in the fall.

535
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.178
And I don't think this
is a place you wanna be

536
00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.005
when it gets dark.

537
00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:43.139
You're probably right.

538
00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:45.968
Um. I will come back tomorrow.
First thing.

539
00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:48.057
-Please have your niece ready.
-I will.

540
00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:49.755
Okay. thank you.

541
00:28:36.802 --> 00:28:39.630
- They gone!
- What?

542
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:41.502
How do you know?

543
00:28:41.589 --> 00:28:45.114
I saw them leaving last night.

544
00:28:45.245 --> 00:28:46.376
Are you sure?

545
00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:47.856
Yeah.

546
00:28:47.943 --> 00:28:51.512
They packed up
their SUV and left.

547
00:28:51.642 --> 00:28:52.861
It was about 10 people.

548
00:29:43.129 --> 00:29:44.304
Whew!

549
00:29:47.524 --> 00:29:51.659
Nancy! Where you at?

550
00:29:52.703 --> 00:29:53.661
-Let me get that.
-Here. babe.

551
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:56.882
Get the rest of
the bags out the car.

552
00:29:56.969 --> 00:30:00.581
and then take the diapers
downstairs to Joanne. all right?

553
00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:03.627
Them kids costing me a fortune.

554
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:07.544
Food better be ready. too.

555
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.982
-'Cause I'm starving!
-Almost...

556
00:30:10.069 --> 00:30:11.505
Well. hurry up!

557
00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:12.985
Cameron!

558
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:16.510
It's ready.

559
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:28.174
Hey!

560
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:29.828
Hey!

561
00:30:31.177 --> 00:30:32.134
What the...

562
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:33.701
hell is wrong with you?

563
00:30:52.981 --> 00:30:55.027
Y'all two. stop
runnin' in this house!

564
00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:01.250
The old lady down
the street says

565
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:03.426
she'll buy the extra
television for $300.

566
00:31:03.513 --> 00:31:06.429
Fine. sell it to her.

567
00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:09.780
But we paid more for that
when we bought it in Atlanta.

568
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:13.697
Ma. you had it
goin' on out there.

569
00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:16.178
Then you had to change it up
bringin' Cameron into all this.

570
00:31:16.265 --> 00:31:17.788
It's the money that
I'm getting from Cameron

571
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.791
that takes care of
you and your baby.

572
00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:23.142
Okay. so then let me
take the other kids

573
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:25.144
down to the office.
get them signed up.

574
00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:26.754
so we can get some
benefits or something.

575
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:28.712
Are you crazy?

576
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.497
What's the point of making
Nan and Jo have these babies

577
00:31:30.627 --> 00:31:32.325
if we ain't cashin' in?

578
00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:35.415
If we take them kids down and
put them in the system here.

579
00:31:35.545 --> 00:31:37.547
that's gonna lead
everybody to us.

580
00:31:37.634 --> 00:31:39.593
Ain't no way the
system in Tennessee

581
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.203
is connected to
the one in Atlanta.

582
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.552
Yeah. well. I'm not
about to find out.

583
00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:44.380
Come on. Ma!

584
00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.991
All I'm sayin' is

585
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:47.383
we ain't been flossin'
like how we used to

586
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.820
since we left Atlanta.

587
00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.649
We gon' have to make some
decisions about them kids soon.

588
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.696
Like what?

589
00:31:55.783 --> 00:31:57.350
Maybe sell two of 'em.

590
00:31:57.437 --> 00:32:00.527
Get a little extra money.

591
00:32:00.614 --> 00:32:02.050
Don't nobody get a free ride.

592
00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:06.359
We gon' be all right.

593
00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:08.056
I got a little somethin'
somethin' brewing.

594
00:32:08.143 --> 00:32:09.275
But Ma--

595
00:32:09.362 --> 00:32:11.451
I said I'm gonna
take care of it!

596
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:15.281
You right.

597
00:32:20.286 --> 00:32:21.809
Bingo.

598
00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:25.117
Who's that?

599
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:31.906
Yeah.
I've always loved kids.

600
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:33.125
Especially when they ain't mine.

601
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.605
I know that's right.

602
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:44.179
So. how long have
you been a nurse?

603
00:32:44.266 --> 00:32:46.007
Over 15 years.

604
00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:47.574
Wow.

605
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:49.706
Ever deliver any kids?

606
00:32:49.837 --> 00:32:52.927
Ugh. I can do it
with my eyes closed.

607
00:32:53.014 --> 00:32:54.450
Hold that thought.

608
00:32:58.193 --> 00:32:59.586
I'm allergic to a lot of things.

609
00:32:59.673 --> 00:33:02.284
so I need to keep these near me.

610
00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:03.677
Sorry to hear that.

611
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.461
It's okay. I'm used to it.

612
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.167
These keep the old
ticker tickin'.

613
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.126
Oh...

614
00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:22.565
Doesn't count.
Divorced.

615
00:33:22.652 --> 00:33:24.350
Mm.

616
00:33:25.264 --> 00:33:28.136
So. where were we?

617
00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:31.226
Well. we were talkin'
about you. your life and...

618
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:35.013
Any family?

619
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.928
War had big effects on me.

620
00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:39.626
Couldn't find a job
to save my life.

621
00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:42.803
Funny how that goes.

622
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.978
Became a burden to
my family and friends.

623
00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:46.894
so no support there.

624
00:33:46.981 --> 00:33:49.549
But I get by pretty well
with my disability checks.

625
00:33:49.636 --> 00:33:52.117
I bet you do.

626
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:53.901
Yeah.

627
00:33:55.207 --> 00:33:57.774
Now all I need is a
good-listening cutie

628
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.863
like yourself
to make my life better.

629
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:02.910
Well...

630
00:34:06.435 --> 00:34:07.741
I can do you one better.

631
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:12.092
I have a big house. and...

632
00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.530
I could use a hero
like you to share it with.

633
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:17.577
Interested?

634
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.585
Trish?

635
00:34:28.152 --> 00:34:29.067
Hey. Trish. it's me!

636
00:34:32.244 --> 00:34:33.375
Trish?

637
00:34:34.942 --> 00:34:36.074
Okay.

638
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:47.259
Trish?

639
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.436
Trish?

640
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.960
Oh my god.

641
00:34:55.918 --> 00:34:57.094
Trish.

642
00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:00.446
Trish. Trish.

643
00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:03.536
-Trish. wake up.
-Cam? Cam?

644
00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:04.798
Oh. Cam.
is that you. baby?

645
00:35:04.885 --> 00:35:06.104
No. no. it's me. It's Renee.

646
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:08.758
Trish. I need you to wake up.
Wake up.

647
00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:10.282
-Where's my baby?
-I don't know.

648
00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:12.066
-Where's Cam?
-Come here. come here.

649
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:13.894
- Come here. come here.
- Where's Cam?

650
00:35:14.024 --> 00:35:16.331
I don't know.
I don't know.

651
00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:18.159
But it's okay.
I'm here. I got you.

652
00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:20.205
My baby...

653
00:35:20.335 --> 00:35:21.423
I got you.

654
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.381
It's okay. it's okay.

655
00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:23.860
I know. I know.

656
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:25.601
I know.

657
00:35:25.688 --> 00:35:27.212
I know. I'm here.

658
00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:28.996
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

659
00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:42.618
I brought you something.

660
00:35:42.705 --> 00:35:44.794
I made some for the
family I keep house for.

661
00:35:44.925 --> 00:35:46.840
I knew today was your birthday.

662
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.930
How?

663
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.019
I saw it on some papers
that Mia keeps upstairs.

664
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.109
Make a wish.

665
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:08.383
What did you wish for?

666
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.733
What do you think?

667
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.040
I've got a gift for you.

668
00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:18.654
When's the last time
you was outside?

669
00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:21.614
I can't remember.

670
00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:25.879
Well. now you got a piece
of the outside with you.

671
00:36:27.097 --> 00:36:30.623
I have God with me.

672
00:36:30.753 --> 00:36:34.322
I hear you every night
sayin' the Lord's Prayer.

673
00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:36.150
And you keep that.

674
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:38.196
You keep hope.

675
00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:40.067
That's all that's
gonna see you through.

676
00:37:03.525 --> 00:37:04.570
Oh!

677
00:37:08.095 --> 00:37:10.837
I thought you said
you lived here alone.

678
00:37:10.967 --> 00:37:12.882
Oh. he don't count.

679
00:37:13.927 --> 00:37:15.798
You know what?

680
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:18.888
Maybe I should think about our
moving in plan a little more

681
00:37:18.975 --> 00:37:22.718
and give you an
answer when I'm sober.

682
00:37:22.805 --> 00:37:23.850
How about we meet up tomorrow?

683
00:37:23.937 --> 00:37:28.898
Well. I would love that.

684
00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:32.728
Um. but at least let me show
you the best part of the house.

685
00:37:35.383 --> 00:37:41.476
It is where you and I...

686
00:37:41.607 --> 00:37:43.913
are gonna spend the
majority of our time.

687
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:49.615
I dare you to try to leave me.

688
00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:55.621
Then show me.

689
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.144
Oh. I will.

690
00:37:58.624 --> 00:38:01.757
You won't be needing
that. you know?

691
00:38:01.844 --> 00:38:04.151
Come on with your pretty self.

692
00:38:09.374 --> 00:38:10.636
This is exciting.

693
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:16.729
Go on in.
I'ma get the light.

694
00:38:16.816 --> 00:38:18.383
Okay.

695
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:21.908
Hey.

696
00:38:22.038 --> 00:38:24.302
Hey. This isn't funny.

697
00:38:24.389 --> 00:38:26.391
Open the door.

698
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.610
Let me out.

699
00:38:28.697 --> 00:38:32.397
Please. please open the door!

700
00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:34.616
Ain't gonna help.

701
00:38:34.703 --> 00:38:35.835
Might as well get used to it.

702
00:38:43.016 --> 00:38:44.974
What the hell are
you talking about?

703
00:38:45.061 --> 00:38:48.282
She can't just leave us here.

704
00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:50.502
We've been stuck in the
basement I don't know how long.

705
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:52.982
Well. when she opens the door.

706
00:38:53.113 --> 00:38:54.419
we need to work together--

707
00:38:54.549 --> 00:38:57.030
Don't you think we've
tried that already?

708
00:38:57.117 --> 00:39:01.121
All we got was a hot spoon
to the skin and a beatin'.

709
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:03.384
She ain't never
gonna let you go.

710
00:39:03.471 --> 00:39:04.733
How old are you?

711
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.692
16.

712
00:39:07.519 --> 00:39:09.085
This is Cameron.

713
00:39:09.216 --> 00:39:11.349
I'm Nancy.

714
00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:15.701
He's Harlen.
and she's Joanne.

715
00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:18.530
-How far along are you?
-Eight months.

716
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.314
Great. so when you
go to the hospital.

717
00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:21.576
you need to tell them
about everything that's--

718
00:39:21.663 --> 00:39:23.273
There ain't no hospital.

719
00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:24.492
Jo gonna have
the baby right here

720
00:39:24.623 --> 00:39:26.842
just like all of us.

721
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.715
What others?

722
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:32.544
How many children are there?

723
00:39:32.631 --> 00:39:34.894
Between me and Jo?
Four.

724
00:39:47.907 --> 00:39:49.517
We need to get
her to a hospital.

725
00:39:49.648 --> 00:39:51.171
We ain't goin' nowhere.

726
00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:53.086
Hey. uh. clean the
blood up off the floor.

727
00:39:53.216 --> 00:39:55.175
If we don't.
she could bleed out!

728
00:39:55.262 --> 00:39:57.133
Bitch. I said we're not leaving.

729
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.527
Now just help with the baby.

730
00:39:59.614 --> 00:40:00.920
Push. Jo!

731
00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:05.446
Push!

732
00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:07.230
There you go. that's it.

733
00:40:07.317 --> 00:40:08.928
It's coming!

734
00:40:11.496 --> 00:40:13.672
Wait...

735
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:16.022
It's not breathing.

736
00:40:16.152 --> 00:40:17.719
Why isn't it breathing?

737
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.155
My god. what's happening?

738
00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:20.635
What's happening?

739
00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:22.855
Again?

740
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:24.073
What the hell's wrong with you.

741
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.032
pushing out all
these dead babies?

742
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:28.338
What kind of monster are you?

743
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:30.253
She just lost her child!

744
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.559
Bitch. you need to
stay out of business

745
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.953
that don't concern you.

746
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.130
Uh. bury it outside.

747
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.698
I think the shovel is
over there next to the--

748
00:40:39.785 --> 00:40:41.003
Where do you think you're goin'?

749
00:40:43.005 --> 00:40:45.051
Grab her. Ang!
Grab her. Ang!

750
00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:51.449
I'm so sorry. Jo.

751
00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:54.582
I'ma keep you in my prayers.

752
00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:58.804
If you really wanna help her.
we have to get out of here.

753
00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:00.675
The last time we
tried to escape--

754
00:41:00.762 --> 00:41:04.026
I don't care
if it didn't work.

755
00:41:04.157 --> 00:41:06.768
Look at Joanne.

756
00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:09.554
No one should live like this.

757
00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:12.774
Oh. we have...

758
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.384

759
00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:23.132
Help! Somebody help!

00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:24.264

00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:44.110
Just what the hell is
goin' on down here?

767
00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:45.720
We have to get her to a doctor.

768
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:48.027
I need to
keep these near me.

769
00:41:48.114 --> 00:41:50.029
She don't
need no damn doctor.

770
00:41:50.116 --> 00:41:51.247
She just need them pills.

00:41:51.334 --> 00:41:52.597

777
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:03.695
I don't know. CPR or something.

778
00:42:03.782 --> 00:42:05.261
I don't know how!

779
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:07.655
I can't breathe.

780
00:42:07.742 --> 00:42:08.787
Shut up!

781
00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:13.182
Don't give them to me. stupid.

782
00:42:13.269 --> 00:42:14.662
Give them to her.

783
00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:24.498
What's happening?

784
00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:36.336
Oh. this bad.

785
00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:37.903
What did you do?

786
00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:41.646
I-I didn't do anything.

787
00:42:41.733 --> 00:42:43.604
No. this is all your fault.

788
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:45.650
No...

789
00:42:45.737 --> 00:42:46.868
Yeah. the police are
gonna make you pay for this.

790
00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:48.261
No!

791
00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:49.523
They gonna
give you the chair

792
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.959
for killing this white woman.

793
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.265
-Help me.
-Shut up.

794
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:53.701
Please help me--

795
00:42:53.788 --> 00:42:54.920
I said shut up and
don't touch me!

796
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.011
Now look at me.

797
00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:02.492
Now. I'm gonna help you.

798
00:43:02.623 --> 00:43:04.712
But you remember that
at any given moment.

799
00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:07.846
I can tell the
police what you did.

800
00:43:07.976 --> 00:43:11.023
And they will fry you.

801
00:43:11.153 --> 00:43:13.242
So you remember where
your loyalties lie.

802
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.680
No. no. no. no. no. no.

803
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.552
Mia. what are we gonna do now?

804
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:20.598
Hide it where you hid
all the other bodies.

805
00:43:22.948 --> 00:43:24.689
Mia. this different.

806
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:27.169
That's a white woman.

807
00:43:27.256 --> 00:43:28.693
And you know them people
gonna come lookin' for her.

808
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.479
Then I guess you need to hide
the body real good. then.

809
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:37.310
Damn!

810
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:38.790
Hey. Harlen. go
get the tools. man.

811
00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.139
Hurry up!

812
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:53.718
I'm only gonna
say this once.

813
00:43:53.805 --> 00:43:56.590
It's not your fault.

814
00:43:56.677 --> 00:43:57.591
But Mia said--

815
00:43:57.722 --> 00:43:59.811
To hell with Mia.

816
00:43:59.898 --> 00:44:03.292
I need you to know that
it's not your fault.

817
00:44:03.379 --> 00:44:05.512
No matter what happens. okay?

818
00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:09.081
Cameron!

819
00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.387

00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:41.940
He be actin' a fool!

821
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.724
A straight fool.

I love me some
Will Smith. though.

00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:51.993

You are one ugly girl.

828
00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:14.407
You know that?

829
00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:17.105
But I guess it's...genetic.

830
00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:22.241
Ugly mother.

831
00:45:22.328 --> 00:45:23.938
Ugly daughter.

832
00:45:33.513 --> 00:45:34.383
Super funny.

838
00:45:51.836 --> 00:45:53.707
Can't even watch my show...

839
00:45:55.448 --> 00:45:57.189
Yeah. that's right.

Good.

843
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:12.552
Take out the trash.

844
00:46:12.682 --> 00:46:14.380
I'll put the food away.

845
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.643
Okay.

846
00:46:43.975 --> 00:46:45.063
God...

847
00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:50.111
I know that you're everywhere.

848
00:46:50.198 --> 00:46:52.331
so I know that you can hear me.

849
00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:57.727

00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:59.338

851
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.257
Hey Mia. this girl out
here talkin' to trees.

852
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.867
What she sayin'?

853
00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:08.826
How the hell would I know?

854
00:47:08.913 --> 00:47:10.828
Look like she
praying or something.

855
00:47:10.915 --> 00:47:12.525
I don't know why.
It ain't helped her yet.

856
00:47:13.439 --> 00:47:14.788
Cameron's smart.

857
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:15.876
She ain't like the other ones.

858
00:47:16.007 --> 00:47:17.225
Fool!

859
00:47:17.356 --> 00:47:18.270
Please. okay?

860
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.228
She ain't even gone to school.

861
00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:21.534
You ain't gotta go
to school to be smart.

862
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:23.362
and you know that.

863
00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:25.538
She quiet.

864
00:47:25.625 --> 00:47:27.235
She observes.

865
00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:29.324
She different.

866
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:30.848
And most important.
she ain't afraid of you.

867
00:47:33.285 --> 00:47:36.592
Chris. what you
even talkin' about?

868
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:39.769
I so much as say "boo." that
girl be cryin' for her mama.

869
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.817
Listen. I know she knows that
you call the shots. aight?

870
00:47:43.948 --> 00:47:45.471
But deep down. she know

871
00:47:45.558 --> 00:47:46.776
there is somebody out
there lookin' for her.

872
00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:48.996
Somebody who cares about her.

873
00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:51.694
And sometimes that's all the
hope you need to keep goin'.

874
00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:54.480
Mark my word. the
first chance she gets.

875
00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:55.960
that girl gonna try
to run away from here.

876
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.048
I'm tellin' you.

877
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.402
Kitchen is done.

878
00:48:03.532 --> 00:48:05.012
Good.

879
00:48:05.143 --> 00:48:06.405
Get back to the basement.

880
00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:18.896
Can't sleep either?

881
00:48:24.031 --> 00:48:25.250
I used to do that.

882
00:48:26.512 --> 00:48:27.774
Look outside and wonder

883
00:48:27.861 --> 00:48:29.689
if I'd ever get
a chance to be out there

884
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:33.388
without Mia on my back.

885
00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:35.956
I feel like you know
so much about me.

886
00:48:36.043 --> 00:48:38.393
I never even asked
how you met Mia.

887
00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:41.266
How any of y'all met her.

888
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:44.138
Joanne ran away from home.

889
00:48:44.269 --> 00:48:46.880
and she was lookin'
for a mother figure.

890
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.882
She thought she was
gettin' that from Mia.

891
00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:54.366
Harlen. he was...lookin'
for somebody to love him.

892
00:48:54.496 --> 00:48:57.238
treat him like a man.

893
00:48:57.369 --> 00:48:59.632
She told him that she loved
him. and he believed her.

894
00:49:01.634 --> 00:49:04.028
And you?

895
00:49:07.074 --> 00:49:09.381
I was just lookin'
for money to get high.

896
00:49:09.468 --> 00:49:10.643
And Mia offered me that too.

897
00:49:13.298 --> 00:49:15.648
She'll become whatever you
need her to be to reel you in.

898
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.695
And once you fall for it.

899
00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.741
she closes the basement door
in your face.

900
00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:28.269
I'm not on drugs anymore.
so there's that.

901
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.100
But you?

902
00:49:33.231 --> 00:49:35.885
You keep lookin' outside.

903
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:37.322
You don't let these
four walls determine

904
00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:39.150
how your life gon' turn out.

905
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.502
Okay?

906
00:50:01.433 --> 00:50:03.087
Excuse me. ma'am?

907
00:50:03.217 --> 00:50:04.697
Can I carry your bag
for some spare change?

908
00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:07.091
Excuse me?

909
00:50:07.178 --> 00:50:09.180
Ma'am?

910
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.051
Hey.

911
00:50:11.138 --> 00:50:13.532
Look. I-I know you see
a homeless drunk man.

912
00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:16.230
but...I served the country.

913
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:17.971
Even went overseas.

914
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:19.190
Did you. now?

915
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.582
- Yes. ma'am.
- Hm.

916
00:50:20.669 --> 00:50:22.062
Even saw some action.

917
00:50:22.149 --> 00:50:24.586
Okay. which war?

918
00:50:24.673 --> 00:50:25.587
Iraq?

919
00:50:25.674 --> 00:50:28.329
When did you serve?

920
00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:29.243
Ah. it's been a--

921
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.376
Now. you see that?

922
00:50:31.463 --> 00:50:34.509
If it's one thing I
can't stand. it's a liar.

923
00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:36.511
If you wanted some money
to get you a drink.

924
00:50:36.642 --> 00:50:38.731
all you had to do was ask.

925
00:50:39.993 --> 00:50:41.125
Yes. ma'am.

926
00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:47.827
'Cause you know even
I like a good drink.

927
00:50:49.307 --> 00:50:52.092
You really didn't have to
come up with this fantasy.

928
00:50:52.223 --> 00:50:53.920
I apologize.

929
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.183
No worries.

930
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.403
Oh...

931
00:51:00.013 --> 00:51:02.929
If you lookin' for
a job. I have one.

932
00:51:03.016 --> 00:51:05.932
Comes with a place to
stay and food to eat.

933
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.238
And alcohol.

934
00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:11.198
Sounds like my kind of work.

935
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:14.245
I just have one rule...

936
00:51:14.332 --> 00:51:17.117
When I tell you to do
something. you do it.

937
00:51:17.248 --> 00:51:19.206
No questions asked.

938
00:51:19.293 --> 00:51:20.947
Are we clear?

939
00:51:21.034 --> 00:51:22.818
You pay me.

940
00:51:22.905 --> 00:51:24.516
you tell me to jump.
I won't even ask how high.

941
00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:27.823
Good.
You can start tonight.

942
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:29.086
-Get in.
-Yes. ma'am.

943
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:37.006
So. what's your name?

944
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:39.966
Travis. but everyone
calls me Pastor.

945
00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:42.099
Pastor? Why?

946
00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:44.449
Right here.

947
00:51:48.844 --> 00:51:50.063
Thank the Lord.

948
00:51:53.675 --> 00:51:55.024
Want some?

949
00:51:55.155 --> 00:51:56.287
No. I don't know
where your lips been.

950
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:58.506
So these them. huh?

951
00:51:58.593 --> 00:52:00.987
Mm-hmm.

952
00:52:01.074 --> 00:52:03.468
The hotel behind
the liquor store.

953
00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:08.125
What about buddy?

954
00:52:08.212 --> 00:52:09.996
No.

955
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:12.390
But these other
three. they can work.

956
00:52:12.477 --> 00:52:13.826
Please. Mia. not Cam.

957
00:52:13.913 --> 00:52:15.610
She just 16.

958
00:52:15.697 --> 00:52:17.743
She's old enough.

959
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.832
She gonna have to
learn about it someday.

960
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.921
Wait. what?

961
00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:26.578
Even her?

962
00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:29.494
Yeah. even her.

963
00:52:29.624 --> 00:52:32.323
I heard that men like women
that's already knocked up.

964
00:52:47.642 --> 00:52:49.383
Nancy?

965
00:52:49.514 --> 00:52:51.951
What?

966
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:53.518
What's gonna happen
at the motel tomorrow?

967
00:53:01.526 --> 00:53:04.616
Cam. you. um. remember those
Bible verses you used to say

968
00:53:04.746 --> 00:53:07.358
when you first got here?

969
00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:10.535
The ones I said
got on my nerves?

970
00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:11.623
Yeah.

971
00:53:13.494 --> 00:53:15.757
They didn't.

972
00:53:15.888 --> 00:53:17.716
They actually...

973
00:53:17.803 --> 00:53:19.631
calmed me in a weird way.

974
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:27.769
Tomorrow...

975
00:53:27.856 --> 00:53:31.556
when Pastor takes
us to that motel.

976
00:53:31.686 --> 00:53:34.385
I want you to say those
verses to yourself. you hear?

977
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:40.173
Just keep sayin'
them over and over

978
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.480
until it stops.

979
00:53:43.698 --> 00:53:45.222
Okay.

980
00:53:49.748 --> 00:53:51.880
Cam. I know you
lost a lot of faith

981
00:53:51.967 --> 00:53:55.841
when that lady died
down here. but...

982
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:57.582
but I think it jumped on me.

983
00:53:59.888 --> 00:54:02.413
I'm gonna get us out of here.

984
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.676
All of us.

985
00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:08.375
Just hold on. okay?

986
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:09.768
Hold on.

987
00:54:41.756 --> 00:54:43.889
I been waiting all day for this.

988
00:55:02.255 --> 00:55:04.126
Our father in
the heavens.

989
00:55:04.257 --> 00:55:07.391
let Your name be sanctified.

990
00:55:07.478 --> 00:55:09.741
Let Your kingdom come.

991
00:55:09.828 --> 00:55:11.656
Let Your word take place

992
00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:13.527
as in Heaven. also on earth.

993
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.060
She all we got left.

994
00:55:25.147 --> 00:55:27.062
Take her or leave her.

995
00:55:51.086 --> 00:55:53.306
No. no. no. no. no. no.

996
00:55:53.393 --> 00:55:55.395
Relax.

997
00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.313
You're a nice girl.

998
00:56:00.444 --> 00:56:01.749
You want candy?

999
00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:02.968
I have candy.

1000
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:15.197
...and the United States

1001
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.895
have little reason to fear

1002
00:56:17.025 --> 00:56:19.027
importing inflation
from overseas.

1003
00:56:19.114 --> 00:56:21.508
The European Central Bank
on Wednesday

1004
00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:23.945
kept interest rates unchanged.

1005
00:56:24.032 --> 00:56:26.644
resisting pressure to join
other major central banks

1006
00:56:26.731 --> 00:56:27.993
and help stimulate the...

1007
00:56:31.823 --> 00:56:33.433
How we do?

1008
00:56:33.564 --> 00:56:36.393
$790.

1009
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:40.745
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1010
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:42.399
That place is full of
Johns around the clock.

1011
00:56:44.357 --> 00:56:46.228
Go on. put them
in the shower.

1012
00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:49.406
and then give 'em some
leftovers out the refrigerator.

1013
00:56:51.103 --> 00:56:53.148
You heard her!
What you waitin' for?

1014
00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:54.585
Go!

1015
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:58.110
Move it!

1016
00:58:10.138 --> 00:58:11.792
It's coming?

1017
00:58:11.923 --> 00:58:12.837
Breathe. breathe.

1018
00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.405
Mia!

1019
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:17.581
What are
you yelling about?

1020
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:19.278
It's Joanne!

1021
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:20.714
What's wrong with Joanne?

1022
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:22.368
She's having the baby!

1023
00:58:25.153 --> 00:58:26.546
Okay. well. come on.

1024
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:27.808
Push it out.

1025
00:58:30.115 --> 00:58:31.116
Push it out.

1026
00:58:32.987 --> 00:58:35.076
Go on and push.
You can do it.

1027
00:58:35.163 --> 00:58:36.295
You got it.

1028
00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:41.169
Cameron. please go
get some towels.

1029
00:58:41.256 --> 00:58:42.562
You can do it.
okay?

1030
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.629
You got yourself a
beautiful baby girl.

1031
00:59:05.716 --> 00:59:07.369
Yes. I do

1032
00:59:07.456 --> 00:59:10.982
have myself a
beautiful baby girl.

1033
00:59:15.073 --> 00:59:16.727
I'm gonna call her Baby Mia.

1034
00:59:20.034 --> 00:59:22.471
Yes. baby.

1035
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.038
Yes...

1036
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:25.997
What...

1037
00:59:27.781 --> 00:59:29.304
Oh.!

1038
00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:31.829
Pay me!

1039
00:59:31.959 --> 00:59:33.004
Good play. good play.

1040
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.398
Baby. please shut that baby up.

1041
00:59:36.485 --> 00:59:38.009
Okay. put a little
powder in the bottle

1042
00:59:38.096 --> 00:59:39.793
and give it to her.
make her ass go to sleep.

1043
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.490
All right.

1044
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:44.493
As I was saying before
I was rudely interrupted.

1045
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.757
we've been gone long enough.

1046
00:59:46.844 --> 00:59:49.673
Cam's 17 now.
practically an adult.

1047
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:52.806
Her mama probably not even
lookin' for her no more.

1048
00:59:52.937 --> 00:59:55.156
I just don't get why we
can't go back to Atlanta.

1049
00:59:58.029 --> 01:00:00.858
She was just a little hungry.
But. but look. Angela.

1050
01:00:00.945 --> 01:00:03.121
ain't nobody trying to go
back down to Atlanta. all right?

1051
01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.036
I'm trying to go
back down to Atlanta.

1052
01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.646
I ain't never been to Atlanta.

1053
01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.300
And ain't nobody askin'
you to go either.

1054
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.475
Exactly.

1055
01:00:09.562 --> 01:00:10.694
Well. if I were to go.

1056
01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:13.740
and I'm not sayin' that I am.

1057
01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:16.134
Pastor would come with us.

1058
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:17.788
He done earned his
spot in the family.

1059
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:21.574
Well. I'm tired of the people.

1060
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:24.055
and I'm tired of
smelling like cows!

1061
01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:25.404
We not flossin' down here--

1062
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:28.450
--like we used to in Atlanta.

1063
01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:30.931
I'm so tired of
hearing you say that.

1064
01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:33.934
Ain't nobody keeping you here.

1065
01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:36.937
So you sayin' I can leave?

1066
01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:38.460
If I was forcin' you to stay.

1067
01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:40.506
you'd be locked in the
basement...

1068
01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.873
Girl. she
playing with you!

1069
01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:09.056
All I'm sayin'. if you wanna
go. you can go on and go.

1070
01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:11.668
Hell. that's two
less mouths to feed.

1071
01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:13.844
Now. I know that's right.

1072
01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:16.629
But I'm gonna need you
to take Joanne's kids with you.

1073
01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:19.414
'cause I'mma give
Pastor the room.

1074
01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.634
And you see if you can get
they benefits started up again

1075
01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:25.072
down in Atlanta.

1076
01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:26.117
Sit down.

1077
01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:33.385
I'm sending two kids
up there with you.

1078
01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:35.996
And it better be two

1079
01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.955
when Pastor comes
to check things out.

1080
01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:46.441
Okay. where were we?

1081
01:01:46.528 --> 01:01:48.008
I smell some money.

1082
01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:49.401
You about to give me 20 points.

1083
01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.055
Game. pow!

1084
01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:55.015
She's taking my kids.
She's taking my kids.

1085
01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:57.539
-She's taking my kids.
-What are you talking about?

1086
01:01:57.626 --> 01:02:00.151
Angela's moving back. and
she's taking my kids with her!

1087
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.677
What about the baby?

1088
01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.287
I don't know!

1089
01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:08.725
I don't know what
she's gonna do.

1090
01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:14.121
Lookin' at those
trees ain't gonna help.

1091
01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.514
I know you think
God is everywhere.

1092
01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:17.124
but he ain't. 'cause if he was.

1093
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.431
he wouldn't keep letting all
this bad stuff happen to us.

1094
01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.261
It is not God that lets bad
things happen to people.

1095
01:02:25.611 --> 01:02:27.091
But he ain't savin'
us from it. either.

1096
01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:31.748
You think God gonna let
me hold my babies again?

1097
01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:34.707
I hope so.

1098
01:03:18.142 --> 01:03:19.839
I can watch
baby Mia in the kitchen.

1099
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:21.232
If you want.

1100
01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.411
No. not in the kitchen.

1101
01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:28.892
That's too dangerous in there.

1102
01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:31.111
Uh. you can take her to
the basement. all right?

1103
01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:32.504
I'ma go handle some business.

1104
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:51.523
Oh!

1105
01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:55.744
Oh. she look like my mama.

1106
01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:56.789
She's beautiful.

1107
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.708
I know Mia call her Baby Mia.
but that's not her name.

1108
01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:04.362
That's not your name!

1109
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:06.407
It's Marie.

1110
01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:07.844
That's my mama name.

1111
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:11.760
What's your mama name?

1112
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.501
Cathy.

1113
01:04:13.588 --> 01:04:15.764
I used to think
she was so strict.

1114
01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.115
but now I know
she just loved me.

1115
01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:22.467
What about your mother?

1116
01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:24.512
Ruth.

1117
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:26.819
She died when I
was a little girl.

1118
01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:29.430
I don't remember much about her.

1119
01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:31.476
Been alone ever since.

1120
01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.392
My mother's name is Patricia.

1121
01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:36.829
She's the prettiest
lady you'd ever see.

1122
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.963
She's funny. too.

1123
01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:43.009
She looked out for me back then.

1124
01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:44.881
My other mother's name is Nancy.

1125
01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:50.495
She's brave and strong...

1126
01:04:52.584 --> 01:04:53.759
She's the mother who
takes care of me now.

1127
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.544
She take care of all of us.

1128
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.614
Do you want a piece?

1129
01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:23.920
It's your favorite.

1130
01:05:26.357 --> 01:05:27.445
Thank you.

1131
01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:31.884
You a police officer. right?

1132
01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:36.193
I saw your badge
the first time we met.

1133
01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.587
Surprised?

1134
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.808
Nothing surprises me anymore.

1135
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:47.073
My mama said that.
when you in trouble.

1136
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.337
you should always
call the police.

1137
01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:53.384
Your mama was right.

1138
01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:55.038
Well. I'm in trouble.

1139
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.141
How much for all night?

1140
01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:13.926
How long has she had
you in that basement?

1141
01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.362
Over 10 years.

1142
01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:17.712
Damn.

1143
01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.063
We're gonna do
somethin' about it.

1144
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.413
Thank you so much. Officer.

1145
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.676
I tell you. this woman is evil.

1146
01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:26.547
You have no idea the
kind of stuff she does.

1147
01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:27.984
She...

1148
01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:29.115
She won't even
feed us. you know?

1149
01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:31.117
Like.
This is nothin'.

1150
01:06:31.204 --> 01:06:32.684
Those other girls
you saw. they're--

1151
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:34.120
they're in the basement too.

1152
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:39.691
Where...
Where are you going?

1153
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:46.437
You said we was goin'
to the police station.

1154
01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:48.830
We. we back in my neighborhood.

1155
01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.531
No. this is--
This is the wrong way!

1156
01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:55.011
No!

1157
01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:57.361
You said you would
take me and help me!

1158
01:06:57.448 --> 01:06:58.666
No. please!

1159
01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:00.233
Get up!

1160
01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:01.321
Please don't
leave me back here!

1161
01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:03.193
-Shut up!
-Please don't...

1162
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.238
You the police!
You supposed to help me!

1163
01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:16.075
You said your system was tight.

1164
01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.860
It is.

1165
01:07:18.947 --> 01:07:21.124
Trust it'll never
happen again.

1166
01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.777
I'm not takin' you at your word.

1167
01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.649
Prove it.

1168
01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:28.566
Chris. go get the others.

1169
01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:30.220
Okay.

1170
01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:47.585
Y'all need to see.

1171
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.592
This is what happens when
you try to leave this house.

1172
01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.249
Or talk about what
goes on in this house.

1173
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:04.471
Let me tell you something.

1174
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:06.386
I know everything.

1175
01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:09.955
I'm everywhere.
I'm god in this house!

1176
01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:13.132
Pastor--

1177
01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.655
Get your ass up!
Get your ass up!

1178
01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:16.265
Put her in the attic.

1179
01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.094
Take off her damn clothes.

1180
01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:21.009
I don't want to
waste no good dress

1181
01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.576
on no beat-up bitch.

1182
01:08:24.273 --> 01:08:25.274
Does our word mean
something now?

1183
01:08:27.233 --> 01:08:30.628
Yeah. I'm convinced.

1184
01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:32.846
Run the damn ball. boy!

1185
01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:35.719
I'm gonna go ahead on
and head out to the store.

1186
01:08:35.807 --> 01:08:38.417
I'll be back in about an hour.

1187
01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:41.203
All right. baby.
Be careful.

1188
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.779
Hey. man.

1189
01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:58.830
Sassy little bitch.

1190
01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.486
Hey. bring me a beer!

1191
01:09:03.922 --> 01:09:05.402
And hurry up.

1192
01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:15.585
I said hurry up!

1193
01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:08.465
Nancy...

1194
01:10:14.818 --> 01:10:16.821
My god. it's so hot in here.

1195
01:10:16.907 --> 01:10:18.214

Don't come back.

We good to go for tonight.

1201
01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:05.957
What's the 411 on Nancy?

1202
01:11:08.046 --> 01:11:09.960
You got the policeman and about
five other men askin' about her.

1203
01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.617
You're missin' out on
a whole lot of money.

1204
01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:21.451
I guess she been up

-Okay--
-You need to fix this!

1227
01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:17.115
Everybody shut up!

1229
01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:19.857
-Hell no!
-Pastor!

You said that when
I tell you to jump.

1231
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:25.906
you weren't gonna
ask me how high.

1232
01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:27.559
That's what you told me.

1233
01:12:27.647 --> 01:12:30.258
So don't start askin' now.

1234

Now. get the others.

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:39.589
Hey. take those bags
upstairs for me.

1260
01:13:42.112 --> 01:13:43.767
Ma. let me show
you the basement.

1261
01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:05.963
It ain't really
much of a basement.

1262
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:07.965
And the manager's strict.

1263
01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:10.315
Don't want anything down
here. not even no animals.

1264
01:14:10.402 --> 01:14:12.143
So they can't stay long.

1265
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.580
Yeah. well. we'll
be out of your hair

1266
01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:16.321
once we find a place of our own.

1267
01:14:18.323 --> 01:14:20.630
There's not enough space
down here for all of us.

1268
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.588
Don't worry.

1269
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.634
I got the perfect spot for you.

1270
01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:43.957
Get in.

1271
01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:46.046
No. please.

1272
01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:48.092
Girl. get in before
I get my BB gun.

1273
01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:49.833
Why are you doing this?

1274
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.618
Because you weak.

1275
01:14:52.705 --> 01:14:54.490
You don't even know what
it takes to survive.

1276
01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:57.318
And you do?

1277
01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:59.407
In this life. you either
taken from somebody

1278
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.279
or they taken from you.

1279
01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:04.717
I do what I gotta do to make it.

1280
01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:08.286
I held this family down
when your grandma died!

1281
01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:10.375
And what thanks do I get?

1282
01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.985
Nothing.

1283
01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:14.771
The disrespect.

1284
01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:18.514
Through all the beatings.
the rape. the jail time...

1285
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.213
I was always there
for the family.

1286
01:15:24.824 --> 01:15:26.870
But it wasn't enough.

1287
01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:30.743
So forget them.

1288
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:33.833
But your ass is weak.

1289
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.270
And I'ma make it strong like me.

1290
01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:39.012
Like you?

1291
01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:40.405
I'll never be like you!

1292
01:15:42.362 --> 01:15:43.364
No!

1293
01:15:43.451 --> 01:15:45.062
No. please!

1294
01:15:54.853 --> 01:15:57.727
Aunt Mia. please!

1295
01:15:57.814 --> 01:16:00.164
Auntie Mia!

1296
01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:03.166
Please. Auntie Mia. don't--

1297
01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:05.038
Auntie Mia. let me out!

1298
01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:47.210
You gettin' a little too
comfortable in here.

1299
01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:48.952
We're family now.

1300
01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:52.216
Dang. Ma!

1301
01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:53.696
Elijah is upstairs sleeping.

1302
01:16:53.782 --> 01:16:56.089
Can't you take that outside?

1303
01:16:56.175 --> 01:16:57.612
Girl. shut up.
Don't tell me what to do.

1304
01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:01.791
Good riddance.

1305
01:17:05.882 --> 01:17:07.318
Any luck?

1306
01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:08.841
No.

1307
01:17:08.928 --> 01:17:10.277
Nothing with a
basement big enough.

1308
01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.758
Yeah. and that
basement is too small.

1309
01:17:12.889 --> 01:17:15.195
It stinks to high hell.

1310
01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:17.327
Neighbors gonna cause a
fuss one of these days.

1311
01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:19.547
Don't you think I know that?

1312
01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.549
What we can do is
probably air the basement out

1313
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.377
and even let them get some air.

1314
01:17:23.464 --> 01:17:26.032
Maybe that could buy us
some time.

1315
01:17:26.119 --> 01:17:27.512
What about your niece?

1316
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:30.166
Man. it gotta be
100 degrees in there.

1317
01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:34.432
She ain't had no food
or water in three days.

1318
01:17:34.519 --> 01:17:36.608
It's almost like
you're trying to kill the girl.

1319
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:40.003
Our Father
in the heavens.

1320
01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:42.919
let Your name be sanctified.

1321
01:17:43.049 --> 01:17:45.573
Let Your Kingdom come.

1322
01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:48.141
Let Your will take place

1323
01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:50.448
as in Heaven. on earth.

1324
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:54.191
Am I dead?

1325
01:18:33.577 --> 01:18:34.884
All right. thank you for this.

1326
01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:38.061
And. uh...it will
clear this time?

1327
01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:39.452
Yes.

1328
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.759
All right. well.
thank you very much.

1329
01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:41.978
Take care.

1330
01:18:42.108 --> 01:18:43.936
Oh. you know. one more thing?

1331
01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:45.416
We got some complaints
from the neighbors

1332
01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:46.809
about some of the
smells around here.

1333
01:18:46.896 --> 01:18:48.201
I want to make sure there's

1334
01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:49.507
no pets. no dogs.
no nothin'. right?

1335
01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:51.683
I know the rules.

1336
01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:53.946
We don't have any pets.

1337
01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:55.425
- All right. Take care.
- You too.

1338
01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:56.601
All right.

1339
01:19:33.986 --> 01:19:35.814
Oh. god!

1340
01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:37.337
Oh!

1341
01:19:37.424 --> 01:19:38.904
What?

1342
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:39.775
Ugh. I knew it.

1343
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:45.389
Come on out!

1344
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.651
Come on out!

1345
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:47.782
Come on out!

1346
01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:53.223
Oh my god...

1347
01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:01.318
911.
what's your emergency?

1348
01:20:03.362 --> 01:20:05.670
-Police!
-Police!

1349
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.889
Clear?

1350
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.978
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1351
01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:12.895
What the hell are you doing?

1352
01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:14.374
You can't go in
when you don't have a warrant!

1353
01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:15.332
Get off of me!
You're hurting me!

1354
01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:18.422
Police!

1355
01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:21.642
Get down. ma'am!
Get down!

1356
01:20:21.728 --> 01:20:24.254
Hey. get your hands
off of her. man!

1357
01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:25.995
Calm down! Calm down!

1358
01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:28.084
No!

1359
01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:29.433
Don't touch her!

1360
01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:32.523
Stop touching her like that!

1361
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:33.916
Stay calm.

1362
01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:43.664
Oh my god.
We found her.

1363
01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:48.452
Hey. it's okay. it's okay.

1364
01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:50.323
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1365
01:20:50.454 --> 01:20:52.630
I promise.

1366
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.850
Come on.

1367
01:20:58.679 --> 01:21:00.725
You got it.

1368
01:21:04.642 --> 01:21:07.036
You're fine.
I got you.

1369
01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.907
It's all right.

1370
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:10.561
Here we go.

1371
01:21:10.648 --> 01:21:12.780
What's your name. hon?

1372
01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:14.782
I want my mom.

1373
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.394
We'll call your
mom. don't worry.

1374
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:18.960
Thank you.

1375
01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:20.484
Let's go.

1376
01:21:22.529 --> 01:21:23.879
Cleared out.

1377
01:21:47.684 --> 01:21:50.514
Our Father in the heavens.

1378
01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:53.473
let Your name be sanctified.

1379
01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:56.172
Let Your kingdom come...

1380
01:21:56.302 --> 01:21:58.739
Let Your will take place

1381
01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:00.916
--as in Heaven.
also on earth.

1382
01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.184
Mama?

1383
01:22:33.992 --> 01:22:39.432
Next on the docket.
we have Mrs. Mia Smith.

1384
01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:43.262
For the record. please
state your name.

1385
01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:45.351
Mia Smith.

1386
01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:47.788
At this time. you may
explain to the board

1387
01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:49.573
why you're suitable
for early parole.

1388
01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:54.230
I didn't have a easy life.

1389
01:22:54.317 --> 01:22:58.451
I was abused by my own mother
and by others in my family.

1390
01:23:00.366 --> 01:23:03.195
I did what I...

1391
01:23:03.282 --> 01:23:04.501
could do to survive.

1392
01:23:05.763 --> 01:23:08.200
Yeah. I did wrong.

1393
01:23:08.287 --> 01:23:10.855
But I learned my lesson.

1394
01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.945
I got help.

1395
01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:15.991
And now I know that I
hurt a lot of people.

1396
01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:20.778
I'm sorry.

1397
01:23:23.172 --> 01:23:27.741
And I know that if you
give me another chance.

1398
01:23:27.871 --> 01:23:30.005
I can be a productive
member of society.

1399
01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:35.880
Thank you for listening
to my petition.

1400
01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:43.366
Thank you. Ms. Smith.

1401
01:23:46.585 --> 01:23:49.415
If there's anyone else
who wishes to speak.

1402
01:23:49.502 --> 01:23:50.895
you may do so now.

1403
01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:55.117
Thank you.

1404
01:23:55.204 --> 01:23:56.727
For the record. your name is?

1405
01:23:58.076 --> 01:24:00.469
Cameron Smith.

1406
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.949
Thank you. Miss Smith.

1407
01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.951
What would you like to say?

1408
01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:06.780
You once told me

1409
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:11.219
that you held down the
family after Grandma died.

1410
01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:14.832
But you don't know
what family means.

1411
01:24:14.919 --> 01:24:16.834
Family looks out for each other.

1412
01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:20.664
They care for each other.

1413
01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:21.882
Family doesn't hurt each other.

1414
01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:29.193
They don't...hold
each other captive.

1415
01:24:29.281 --> 01:24:31.501
rape.

1416
01:24:31.588 --> 01:24:34.156
torture.

1417
01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:36.419
or force each other into
sexual acts with strangers.

1418
01:24:40.945 --> 01:24:45.471
You said you did
those things to me

1419
01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:48.039
to make me strong.

1420
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:52.609
Well. I'm stronger than you.

1421
01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:56.960
And I won't hurt others
the way that you hurt me.

1422
01:24:59.877 --> 01:25:01.096
You're evil.

1423
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:04.708
And you don't
deserve to be free.

1424
01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:09.626
Thank you.

1425
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.802
Thank you.
