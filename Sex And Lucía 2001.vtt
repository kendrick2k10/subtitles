SEX AND LUCIA

4
00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:19.346
I'm sorry. Lorenzo.
For everything l said when l left.

5
00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.474
Yeah. but you were right.

6
00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.394
You live with a sick person.

7
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.897
No. that's not true.

8
00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.566
I was too hard on you.

9
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.569
Don't worry. Lucía.
That's it.

10
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:38.574
I’m in a hole.
I've tried to get out. but l can't.

11
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.368
I’m lost forever.

12
00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.997
I'll take a few days off
and we'll take a trip.

13
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.082
To your island.

14
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.794
You can show me.
How about it?

15
00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:54.298
Just the two of us.
It's calm this time of year.

16
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.301
We'll swim
and lay in the sun.

17
00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.595
l don't want
to go to the island.

18
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.267
I don't understand you.
You always wanted to go back.

19
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.072
Relax. honey.
Don't worry.

20
00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:25.787
Look. wait up for me
and tell me tonight.

21
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.457
I’ll listen to anything you say.

22
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.923
Is that why
you're so screwed up?

23
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.218
Something about the island?

24
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.804
I’m sorry.
l can't tell you about it.

25
00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.766
You don't deserve this.
You shouldn't know.

26
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.559
Lucía.
we're slammed.

27
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.979
Sorry. I have to hang up.

28
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.942
- We're slammed. but later...
- Yeah. slammed. Bye.

29
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.556
Sorry. but l have to go.
Lorenzo needs me.

30
00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:29.601
lf l were you.
I'd take him to a shrink.

31
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:53.959
Lorenzo.

32
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.707
Lorenzo?

33
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.627
- Lorenzo Alvarez residence?
- Yes.

34
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:40.213
Are you a family member?

35
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:43.050
I’m his girlfriend.
I live with him. What is it?

36
00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:46.803
This is the police department
calling to inform you that...

37
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.305
I’ve got some bad news.

38
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.182
Don't wait up.

39
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.101
l may never be back... ever.

40
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.770
You see. he...

41
00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.981
a car came along and...

42
00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.650
l don't know where to.
but far away.

43
00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:03.779
I leave you everything...
but me.

44
00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.490
Forgive me.
That's my last request.

45
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.206
I’ll live alone.

46
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.292
With no one else.

47
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.627
I don't need people.

48
00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.513
What'll it be?

49
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.984
Alone.

50
00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.903
Alone in the sun.

51
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.115
No.

52
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:02.202
I’m not gonna swim.
I’ll stay in the sun.

53
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.045
Alone.

54
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.714
Alone in the sun.

55
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.717
Alone.
Alone in the sun.

56
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:39.758
SEX
6 YEARS EARLIER

57
00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:43.822
The best fuck of my life.

58
00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.700
I don't even know your name.

59
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.787
It’s better that way.
Less complicated.

60
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.376
Give me a hint.

61
00:13:56.544 --> 00:14:00.338
Anything.
I’d like that.

62
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:04.676
Like a souvenir.
Where are you from?

63
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.845
Madrid.

64
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.680
I’m from Valencia.

65
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.432
Another one.

66
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.435
Two more hints each
and we go our separate ways.

67
00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.691
I’m a paella expert.

68
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.194
- That's logical.
- Not quite. Keep in mind

69
00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.823
that you just fucked
a world- class cook.

70
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.035
You're right.

71
00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.580
Everything was delicious.

72
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.290
Of course.

73
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:38.793
A little salty. though.

74
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.045
What about you?

75
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.547
Sure. lots.

76
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.091
- Let's hear one.
- l was born in Madrid

77
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.886
on this very day.

78
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.096
Around this time.

79
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.017
It’s your birthday!

80
00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:56.019
Yes.

81
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.897
My birthday boy from Madrid.

82
00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.065
What a great way to celebrate!

83
00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:04.027
I’m your paella chef
from Valencia.

84
00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:06.154
And your birthday gift.

85
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.156
Hey. that's three things!

86
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.868
You gave me only two.

87
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:15.038
I’m going to look for the third.

88
00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.112
I’ve been calling all morning.

89
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.782
It’s not my fault he's so busy.

90
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.327
- Then who's fault is it?
- It’s his job's fault.

91
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:58.373
Tell him to work less.
I’ll call back later.

92
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.355
He still can't talk.

93
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.232
Can l leave him a message?

94
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.318
Of course.
I’ll pass it on.

95
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.070
Well. let's see.

96
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.447
I’m pregnant.

97
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:35.576
Since l know it's not his.
and l don't need him.

98
00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:38.204
tell him I’m going to find
my child's father.

99
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.832
- You're leaving?
- That's right.

100
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.460
I’ll give you both
a little hint.

101
00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:46.754
He's not from Valencia.

102
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:50.675
Fine.
one more hint.

103
00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:54.303
I’m leaving right now for...
Madrid.

104
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:59.434
They'll advance you 20 percent
of what they gave you last time.

105
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.812
- l couldn't ask for more.
- No. it's fine. Thanks. Pepe.

106
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.605
It'll get me through winter.

107
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:07.025
I’ll have it ready by summer.

108
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:10.445
Really?
You've been blocked two years.

109
00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.825
I’m figuring out
if I’m really a writer.

110
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.662
You?
A writer?

111
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.789
To the core.

112
00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:29.881
What about that other story?
The one about the island.

113
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.592
And the Valencian girl?

114
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.344
Maybe.

115
00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.055
I’m going to buy smokes.

116
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.268
Put lots of sex in it.
That's always nice.

117
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.395
Yeah. very.

118
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.733
Can l talk to you?

119
00:17:51.111 --> 00:17:53.946
- Now?
- Later. then.

120
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.284
I’m with a friend.

121
00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.417
What about?

122
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.551
Well...

123
00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:17.470
Is something wrong?

124
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:21.849
Yes.

125
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.309
Tell me.

126
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.272
Now?

127
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.608
Yes.

128
00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.003
What's your name?

129
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:52.296
Lucía.

130
00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.006
I’m Lorenzo.

131
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:57.009
l know.
l know you.

132
00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.680
l read your novel.

133
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.057
Many times. and...

134
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.726
l can't read anything else.

135
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:08.437
It grabbed me inside

136
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:10.940
and won't let go.

137
00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.859
But...

138
00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:15.695
I’ve also followed you.

139
00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.405
When l see you

140
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.032
l like to follow behind

141
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.119
and see where you go.
in secret.

142
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:27.081
l know where you live.

143
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.417
It’s nearby.

144
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:34.088
And sometimes l see you here.
Do you recognize me?

145
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.215
No.

146
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:42.555
I’m a waitress
in that restaurant.

147
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.975
You've never come in.

148
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.980
My boss is fine.

149
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:54.358
He's a good cook.

150
00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.028
But he wants to live together.

151
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.863
and the truth is.

152
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.073
l was really glad.

153
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.744
Because...
l felt needed.

154
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.455
And l even like him.

155
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.708
So...

156
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.627
I’ve decided...

157
00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:17.882
What?

158
00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:22.887
The person l really want
to live with is you.

159
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.348
It’s not that you're lonely.

160
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:29.101
I’m completely in love with you.

161
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:32.313
Madly. as you can see.

162
00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:41.072
- You're so brave.
- Yeah.

163
00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:45.701
And it's over.
l tried.

164
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.413
Did you enjoy that?

165
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.505
Feel free to leave.

166
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.010
Is there anything else
you want?

167
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.679
Yes.

168
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:52.351
With time.
living together.

169
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:56.105
you'll end up falling in love
with me. of course.

170
00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:24.216
l think l just did.

171
00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:34.643
Let's go get drunk and celebrate.

172
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:24.151
What pretty lights
you have at home.

173
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:36.705
I’m so happy.
You can't imagine.

174
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:42.711
Go ahead
and undress me.

175
00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:52.304
Forgive me. Lorenzo.

176
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.433
I’m not used
to things working out.

177
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:13.367
Do whatever you want to me.

178
00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:40.227
You start. okay?

179
00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:52.550
A ray of sunshine...

180
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:55.135
Brought your love to me...

181
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:29.336
Slowly. With love.
We're just starting.

182
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.719
Like that.
So it lasts longer.

183
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.391
I’m dying.
I’m dying!

184
00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:29.647
My love!
I’m gonna die!

185
00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.169
It’s delicious.
Lorenzo.

186
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.130
Wait until you try the fish.

187
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:59.385
I’ve always been
around good cooks.

188
00:27:59.552 --> 00:28:01.845
l don't know why.

189
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:05.474
Though my boss
isn't around much anymore.

190
00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:07.267
My grandmother. yes.

191
00:28:07.435 --> 00:28:10.854
With her home cooking...

192
00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:12.189
just for me.

193
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.776
l moved in with her
when l was six.

194
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:20.656
She said my parents and brother
had opened a newsstand in heaven

195
00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:23.784
in front of the angel school.

196
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:25.369
And a bookshop.

197
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.956
Their stand in the village
never paid much.

198
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:32.793
The three of them were killed
in a car crash.

199
00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:36.422
And my poor grandmother
two years ago...

200
00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:39.091
told me the whole story.

201
00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:40.759
l still believe it.

202
00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:44.388
l always liked people
who tell good stories.

203
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.306
l trust them.

204
00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:49.309
Did your mother
teach you to cook?

205
00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:52.771
No. She left my dad real quick.
when l was young.

206
00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:54.648
l had to cook for him.

207
00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:57.943
Until one day he got stabbed.

208
00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:08.662
l may be a shitty cook.
but I’m a great waitress.

209
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.291
l have a camera.

210
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.197
How about a striptease?

211
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.787
Right now.
without getting up.

212
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:35.207
- lf you do one later.
- You wouldn't.

213
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:52.933
I’ve got just what you want.

214
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:01.233
Oh. how l knew...

215
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:04.027
I’ve got just what you want.

216
00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:09.032
Oh. how l knew...
I’ve got just what you want.

217
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.577
It’s all been taken care of.

218
00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:15.080
I’ll settle the score.
remember...

219
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.625
- I’ve got a map...
- Gorgeous.

220
00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:22.921
...and I’m one nosy bitch.
I’m working on it.

221
00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:27.551
I gotta do it.
l don't want to end up broke.

222
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.345
My feet are my ticket...

223
00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:32.431
Had to be good at something...

224
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:34.933
I’m working on it.
I’m working on it.

225
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:37.978
I’m working on it.

226
00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:40.105
I’m resourceful. baby!

227
00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:42.983
You turn me on.
saliva. milk and stuff...

228
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.152
I’m in control.

229
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.548
Lorenzo...

230
00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:32.050
Lorenzo. my love.

231
00:33:32.218 --> 00:33:35.303
l can't take anymore.

232
00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.973
So much love will kill me.

233
00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:52.612
I’m dying!

234
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:59.036
Don't scream.
it's no big deal!

235
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.043
Push.

236
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.962
That's it.
a little more.

237
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:14.634
Here it comes.
A little more.

238
00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:17.596
Here it comes.

239
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:34.321
- I’ll get the dad.
- Yes. please.

240
00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:45.248
You see?
Shouting makes no difference.

241
00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:52.923
There's no one there.

242
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:57.052
It’s all right. my little girl
will help me find him.

243
00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:01.723
Have you ever...
with another girl...

244
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:04.059
had better sex?

245
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:05.936
No.

246
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.813
Tell me the truth.

247
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:13.360
Maybe on an isolated occasion.

248
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:16.196
But it's different.

249
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:18.698
Isolated on the island. right?

250
00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:22.160
Yes.

251
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.123
A random somebody.

252
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.083
a total stranger.

253
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:30.001
with a full moon...

254
00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:37.592
We should go to your island.
Separately. and meet there.

255
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.969
like strangers.

256
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:42.097
We'd have the best sex ever.

257
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:55.193
Which do you prefer?

258
00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:59.156
Wild sex with a stranger?

259
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.616
Or sex with someone you know.

260
00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:03.326
someone you love.

261
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.328
but also wild?

262
00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:09.708
What?

263
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:13.003
You have to choose.

264
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.755
Wild sex with a stranger.

265
00:36:15.923 --> 00:36:19.467
or wild sex with someone

266
00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:22.679
who's crazy about you.
and who you love.

267
00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:26.057
- Go ahead. be frank.
- With you.

268
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:29.936
Finally.

269
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:37.611
I’d never imagined
being so lucky.

270
00:36:37.778 --> 00:36:41.823
Girls like you
never like guys like me.

271
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.081
You're a gift.

272
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:16.942
The restaurant in Madrid
grew famous

273
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:20.320
thanks to the paellas
made by the silent girl.

274
00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:25.283
She still recalled her grandmother.
buried back home with her parents.

275
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:29.079
When asked where she was from.
she was so timid that

276
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.373
she'd say she was from Malta.

277
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:39.172
Her destiny changed that night.
when she ran into a real Maltese.

278
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.009
A ray of sunshine...

279
00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:46.930
Brought your love to me...

280
00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:50.892
A ray of sunshine...

281
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.396
Straight to my heart...

282
00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:33.328
- How's it going?
- Fine.

283
00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:36.956
Getting used to all this clean air.

284
00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:38.958
Yeah.

285
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:43.546
You get used to everything here.
This island's easy.

286
00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:49.260
And you're a pro. of course.
You have oxygen.

287
00:39:49.428 --> 00:39:52.347
I’m renting scuba equipment
this summer.

288
00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:59.729
I’m testing it.
You like diving?

289
00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:03.316
No. not me.
Just the opposite.

290
00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:04.651
Sorry. but...

291
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:08.571
l prefer open air.
Open air and sunshine.

292
00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.907
Too bad.

293
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:13.034
These waters are special.

294
00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:15.829
To each his own.

295
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:30.468
This really isn't an island.

296
00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:33.930
It isn't?

297
00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:38.435
It’s a giant lid.
A floating piece of earth.

298
00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.437
Like a raft.

299
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:45.150
But it isn't moving.

300
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:49.696
People get dizzy here
during high tide.

301
00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:52.615
And no one knows why.

302
00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.993
Except you.

303
00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:58.580
I’ve dived underneath
the whole island.

304
00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:01.207
It’s totally hollow.

305
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:04.335
Thousands of caves.

306
00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:06.838
but nothing else.

307
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:11.384
Not a single rock
connects it to the seafloor.

308
00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:13.553
What's your name?

309
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.597
Carlos.

310
00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:18.183
I’m Lucía.

311
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.268
Trust me. Lucía.

312
00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:21.853
I’ll show you someday.

313
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:23.813
Okay.

314
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.691
But I’ll stay up here.

315
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:30.445
Right. The girl waits
on the pretty side.

316
00:41:30.613 --> 00:41:32.947
and the crab
explores the ugly.

317
00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:36.576
rocky. horrible side.

318
00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:47.962
You want to see the good things
on this island?

319
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:53.051
Yeah.

320
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.470
l want you to meet Elena.

321
00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:20.453
Hi. I’m Elena.

322
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:21.913
Lucía.

323
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:28.002
Stay for dinner?

324
00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:31.422
Okay.

325
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.924
You can sleep here. too.

326
00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:35.760
It’s a guest house.

327
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:37.720
Carlos is alone.

328
00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:41.724
so l have 9 rooms free.
Want to see them?

329
00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.352
Come on.

330
00:42:46.939 --> 00:42:49.023
This is my room.

331
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:59.701
Next to the kitchen.
so l can cook on-line.

332
00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:02.829
- Come on in.
- No. I’m sorry.

333
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:06.040
I’m not ready to see
other people up close.

334
00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:12.672
l know which room.

335
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.012
It’s perfect for you.
Come on.

336
00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:24.684
l leave the second floor vacant
until summer.

337
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:49.292
3.000 a day in low season.
but you can have it for 2.000.

338
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.461
Plus 2.000 if you want board.

339
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:55.256
l recommend it.
I’m the best cook around.

340
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:59.886
Can l skip dinner
and stay tonight?

341
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.472
We'll talk tomorrow.

342
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.307
Of course.

343
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:11.397
Something terrible happened
and l had to run.

344
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:17.737
We'll take care of you here.

345
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:26.579
A ray of sunshine...

346
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:29.540
Straight to my heart...

347
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:33.586
Brought your love to me...

348
00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:37.256
I’d searched for so long...

349
00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:39.384
And finally it's mine...

350
00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:44.305
l have a new guest.
She's a fantastic singer.

351
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:46.891
So from now on.
I’ll cook even better.

352
00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:48.768
lf possible.

353
00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:53.064
Can l name you?

354
00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:56.526
Name?
Yeah. Lucía.

355
00:45:01.573 --> 00:45:03.741
Are you writing it?

356
00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:06.577
It’s still unsent.

357
00:45:07.913 --> 00:45:10.331
You can change your name
if you want.

358
00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:13.000
We all use nicknames.

359
00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:18.047
HER NAME'S LUCIA.

360
00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:22.135
A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

361
00:45:22.302 --> 00:45:24.137
Is that okay?

362
00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:28.182
It’s great.

363
00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.232
Look.

364
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.192
This is for you.

365
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.071
"Sing us something.
Lucía."

366
00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:52.457
A RAY OF SUNSHINE...

367
00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:58.504
STRAIGHT TO MY HEART...

368
00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:08.264
"Welcome. Lucía. Nice song.
Where are you?"

369
00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:14.604
EVERY DAY FURTHER AWAY
FROM WHERE l WAS.

370
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:17.064
l like that.

371
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.944
So would Carlos.
For himself.

372
00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:24.280
He's been here 6 months.

373
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.866
l sense he's still tied
to the mainland.

374
00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:31.913
He's someone
who gains your trust easily.

375
00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:38.628
- Is there anything between you?
- Yeah. sex.

376
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:41.672
Every now and then.

377
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.549
Without intimacy.

378
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.722
l prefer it.
this way l don't get hooked.

379
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.726
Just wild sex.

380
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:57.313
It must be the island.

381
00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.399
Yeah. but...

382
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:04.779
Carlos has the biggest dick
I’ve ever seen.

383
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:06.948
How lucky.

384
00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:12.620
l don't know where he got it.
It’s enormous.

385
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.349
Where are you?

386
00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:17.518
The abortion part.

387
00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:28.321
Is that a hint?

388
00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:31.824
- Why don't you take a stroll?
- l am.

389
00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.118
In the street.

390
00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:36.662
You're like an expectant father.

391
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.915
Exactly.

392
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.585
And you're the mother.

393
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:30.049
It’s very positive.
There's lots of happiness.

394
00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:33.094
It’s me. l was expecting
something tragic.

395
00:49:33.261 --> 00:49:35.054
Like in your first novel.

396
00:49:37.557 --> 00:49:41.310
l should have read it
while you were writing.

397
00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.396
to get used to the idea.

398
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.067
l screwed up.
I’m sorry.

399
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:50.319
I’m going for a walk.

400
00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:56.826
l didn't grab your heart
this time.

401
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.245
l guess l already have it.

402
00:50:11.758 --> 00:50:14.969
Remember that birthday
when you were on the island?

403
00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:18.472
You sure got a great gift.

404
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.852
Get ready. because tonight
I’ve got another for you.

405
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.439
- From me.
- Are you proposing?

406
00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:31.402
Remember my sister?
The one who's a nurse?

407
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:35.823
Well. she's become
close friends with a girl

408
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:40.244
whose baby she helped deliver
four years ago.

409
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:42.538
A little girl.

410
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.463
Speaking of girls...

411
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.966
How's the novel?
All the stalling...

412
00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:56.010
What do l tell my editors?

413
00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:58.220
You always think of something.

414
00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:02.975
Sure. that's why you get
all your stories from me.

415
00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.021
Write this one as is.

416
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.190
It’s unbelievable.

417
00:51:09.357 --> 00:51:10.775
Why's that?

418
00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:13.569
By the way.
don't worry about my sister.

419
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:17.490
She doesn't know it's you.
Or the mother who gave birth.

420
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:20.034
l don't even know her.

421
00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:22.912
l kept you secret.

422
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.081
Why secret?

423
00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:29.376
Well. the baby girl
was born here in Madrid.

424
00:51:29.544 --> 00:51:32.505
But she was conceived
on a beach.

425
00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.715
on an island.

426
00:51:34.883 --> 00:51:37.510
a night like tonight.

427
00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:39.512
with a stranger...

428
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:41.889
from Madrid.

429
00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:44.433
It was his birthday.

430
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:51.065
lf you write this well.
it'll be the story of your life

431
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:54.026
and my birthday gift to you.

432
00:51:56.113 --> 00:52:01.242
l know where to find the kid.
Afternoons in a square.

433
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:03.786
Without the mother.

434
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:06.705
- What's her name?
- The mother?

435
00:52:06.873 --> 00:52:08.874
No. the daughter.

436
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.252
Your daughter's name is Luna.

437
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:16.132
Of course.
Luna.

438
00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:32.625
What's your name?

439
00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:33.959
Luna.

440
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:44.261
What's the sun's name?

441
00:53:47.432 --> 00:53:49.808
- Lorenzo.
- Lorenzo.

442
00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:52.728
Just like me.

443
00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:54.813
What's the moon's name?

444
00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:57.233
- You want the job?
- Yes.

445
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.860
Then the moon's name is Luna.

446
00:54:07.953 --> 00:54:11.205
Today was an important day.

447
00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:30.599
You don't know your father?
You've never seen him?

448
00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.559
Do you know his name?

449
00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.188
No.

450
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:39.149
Don't worry.
names don't matter.

451
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:46.198
Would you like it...

452
00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:48.659
if l were your dad?

453
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:56.875
- Could you be?
- Yeah. if you want me to be.

454
00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:58.836
But in secret.

455
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:00.796
My real father?

456
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:09.888
He thought it was a very big secret
for such a small little girl.

457
00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:11.724
His smile faded.

458
00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:15.769
Then he went over
and sat alongside her.

459
00:55:15.937 --> 00:55:19.481
You know what happens
if someone discovers the secret

460
00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.942
between the moon and the sun?

461
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:28.157
The tide would drop...

462
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:30.159
and drop...

463
00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:31.994
with a sound like:

464
00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.258
Like mountains caving in.

465
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:57.686
Maybe someday
he'd find a way to tell her.

466
00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:01.899
so for the time being
he left it at that.

467
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:04.360
What was the point
of being a father

468
00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:06.570
if she didn't know?

469
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.368
He knew then that
if he'd told her.

470
00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:15.245
she'd have kept the secret.

471
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.083
Secret.

472
00:56:27.008 --> 00:56:29.802
You have a daughter?

473
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.390
Lorenzo. honey.

474
00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:37.226
Do you?

475
00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:39.144
Why do you ask?

476
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:41.772
l saw it on your computer.

477
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.482
And l loved it.

478
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.901
l can't keep writing it.

479
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.236
Why not?

480
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:49.446
l don't know what it is
to be a father.

481
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:52.157
Then make it up.

482
00:57:07.215 --> 00:57:09.883
I’m glad you're writing again.

483
00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:13.303
l was feeling guilty.

484
00:57:13.471 --> 00:57:15.597
None of it is your fault.

485
00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:29.403
Luna doesn't know her dad.

486
00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:31.196
She lives alone with her mom?

487
00:57:31.364 --> 00:57:33.740
No. with a dumb soccer player.

488
00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.413
I’ve never seen my dad.

489
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:44.376
Me. neither.

490
00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:50.883
My mother's an actress.

491
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:52.759
A porn actress.

492
00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:55.429
l like that.

493
00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:57.723
She quit last year.

494
00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:00.225
She met this amazing guy

495
00:58:00.393 --> 00:58:03.979
who was a client.
and fell for him.

496
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.773
Now we live together.

497
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:09.193
He retired her.

498
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.278
Sounds nice.

499
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:13.989
He's the sweetest guy.

500
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.867
He has the biggest heart ever.

501
00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:19.203
And he's handsome.

502
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:22.372
He's really sexy.

503
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.749
You like him. too?

504
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.667
Me?

505
00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:28.837
Why?
Can you tell?

506
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.637
You like him a lot?

507
00:58:36.804 --> 00:58:39.056
Okay. drop it.

508
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:45.395
Would you do him?

509
00:58:45.563 --> 00:58:47.564
No!

510
00:58:47.732 --> 00:58:49.816
He's my mother's lover.

511
00:58:49.984 --> 00:58:53.987
Poor thing.
she's in love for once.

512
00:58:54.155 --> 00:58:56.323
Do you think he likes you?

513
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.250
lf he offered.
and your mom never found out?

514
00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.502
Just once. as a test.

515
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:11.088
A test. right?

516
00:59:11.256 --> 00:59:14.633
This is between you and me.

517
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:18.512
Just once?

518
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.099
Yeah.
Why not?

519
00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.852
Because.

520
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:30.440
l don't know...
l hope l never get put to the test.

521
00:59:32.193 --> 00:59:34.736
But she put him to the test.

522
00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:38.949
One morning when her mother
was shopping.

523
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:41.868
she took a shower
and left the door open.

524
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.962
It almost happened.

525
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.673
What did?

526
01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:39.051
The test with Antonio.

527
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.014
Tell me about it.

528
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.645
Last night.
when they went to bed.

529
01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:53.523
l put one of my mom's movies on.

530
01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.859
It’s strange. but...

531
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:59.154
seeing her in action
gets me hot.

532
01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.448
You masturbated.

533
01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:03.659
You always guess.

534
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:09.373
l took one of her dildos
from her room while they slept.

535
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.296
l lay naked on the sofa.

536
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.090
in the dark.

537
01:01:18.257 --> 01:01:20.300
in front of the TV.

538
01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:23.303
l started copying
her sexual positions.

539
01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.615
Their lust almost killed them.

540
01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.288
He covered her mouth
so her mother wouldn't wake up.

541
01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:04.321
We decided not to tell my mom.

542
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.157
And to never do it again.

543
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.619
l promised Antonio

544
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.831
I’d find myself a boyfriend
right away

545
01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:17.125
so I’d have someone
to play with.

546
01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.507
Here. I’ll loan you my mom
for a couple days.

547
01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.557
l masturbated because of you.

548
01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.810
but ended up thinking of him.

549
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.730
But we didn't do it.

550
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:42.651
I’m not even sure l saw him.

551
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.237
l just felt him.

552
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.405
Spying on me from behind.

553
01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:49.825
At least l think so.

554
01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.572
How nice!

555
01:04:28.739 --> 01:04:31.074
You never greet me
this way anymore.

556
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.080
l should get home early
every night.

557
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:41.877
Your mom was great.

558
01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.045
Quite an actress.

559
01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:47.048
- You got off?
- Yes.

560
01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:51.595
lf only I’d seen you

561
01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.847
through a hole in the wall.

562
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.641
Are you Belén's boyfriend?

563
01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:00.353
Would you like him to be?

564
01:05:00.521 --> 01:05:02.480
Yeah. sure.

565
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.858
Then that's that.

566
01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.754
l have to sleep
at Luna's tonight.

567
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:29.132
Her parents are going out.

568
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:35.305
l can ask if my boyfriend
can come along.

569
01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.642
She's really cool.

570
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:40.477
What's her name?

571
01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.354
Elena.

572
01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.316
Well.

573
01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:50.612
I’d prefer just to see you and Luna.
no one else.

574
01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.541
Why the boyfriend?
Can't they wait?

575
01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.670
She asked me as a special favor.
Maybe they can't.

576
01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:08.713
- They'll fuck.
- Good for them.

577
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:12.258
We don't even know him.
And in our bed?

578
01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.054
You're just like your dog.

579
01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:24.521
Hi. boyfriend.
The doors are open.

580
01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:35.281
Be nice to him
or I’ll have you fixed.

581
01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:36.866
You hear me?

582
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.384
Delicious.
You're a great cook.

583
01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:01.599
And what do you do?

584
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.985
You won't tell me?

585
01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.037
I’ll find out later.

586
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:32.756
l want some water.

587
01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.763
Before l met Luna.
l thought I’d never have kids.

588
01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.143
Wouldn't you want
a daughter like her?

589
01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:49.981
Of course.

590
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.359
To me...

591
01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:55.904
you'll always be my first.

592
01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.156
And to you?

593
01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:01.117
The first and only.

594
01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.021
Can l watch TV?

595
01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:36.027
It’s late.
go to bed.

596
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:38.196
lf Lorenzo tucks me in.

597
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:41.032
You'll have to show me where.

598
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.955
And a kiss?

599
01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:17.861
- Can you tell stories?
- Of course. that's my job.

600
01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:47.557
Did you know that island
has the lowest moon?

601
01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:54.772
That's right. But only a few of us
in the world know it.

602
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.360
It also has great weather
and it grants wishes.

603
01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:02.739
lf you need something.
the rocks below the shore

604
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.533
give it to you as a gift.

605
01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:09.996
But watch out for the holes
in the ground.

606
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:16.127
Though it doesn't matter.
because no one ever dies there.

607
01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:20.757
For example. if you fall.
you can choose any life you want.

608
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.843
You can be your favorite fish.

609
01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.830
The island was glad
when the girl arrived.

610
01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.874
especially the rocks
below the shore.

611
01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.418
so they decided
to give her something.

612
01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.295
But what?

613
01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.507
A raft.

614
01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.051
Bigger.

615
01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.013
- A dog.
- No. Something she didn't have.

616
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:11.432
Her father.

617
01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.353
Bull's-eye. butterfly.

618
01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:51.180
Tonight you keep watch outside.

619
01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:59.397
All she had to do
was look everywhere for him

620
01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.524
until she found him.

621
01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:05.236
Her father could be
whoever she wanted.

622
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:11.326
But then the girl had doubts.
like everyone.

623
01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:15.330
Would she choose a lighthouse keeper
or a fisherman?

624
01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.458
She knew one thing:
what she really wanted

625
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:21.961
was her mother to become
a beautiful mermaid.

626
01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:34.098
She's asleep.

627
01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:45.777
Belén. l want you
to know something.

628
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:51.115
l changed into this.
do you mind?

629
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.022
Hi. it's Elena.

630
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:53.274
Is Belén there?

631
01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.484
Yes.

632
01:16:55.652 --> 01:16:58.195
It’s Elena.

633
01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.495
Hello?

634
01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:09.206
- How are you?
- Better.

635
01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:13.544
I’m improving.
And you?

636
01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:17.423
Well. l haven't cried.

637
01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.967
l can't.
l haven't seen her.

638
01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:24.055
They told me.
but l don't understand.

639
01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:27.475
l don't want to imagine it.
That's why l came here.

640
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:31.103
To be closer to her
by swimming in the sea.

641
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.150
Cry. Belén.

642
01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.778
Now that you can.

643
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.701
It helps me
to hear you cry.

644
01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.208
That's it.
Cry. Cry.

645
01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:55.086
You need to cry.

646
01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:59.799
She hears you. too.

647
01:17:59.966 --> 01:18:03.552
A big kiss from the sea...

648
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.596
from both of us.

649
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:18.109
Lately you're always in bed.

650
01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:20.111
You know what time it is?

651
01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.950
It’s a beautiful day.
Sunny and clear.

652
01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.286
And it's my day off.

653
01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.997
Get up. lazybones!

654
01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:40.423
You need all these pills
just to sleep?

655
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.384
You never had problems
sleeping before.

656
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.056
Lorenzo. honey.

657
01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:53.269
I’m worried about you.
You've been depressed for days.

658
01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.854
Trouble with the novel?

659
01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.773
Is that it?

660
01:18:57.941 --> 01:19:01.485
You look terrible.

661
01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:03.988
Something's happened.

662
01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.365
What?

663
01:19:09.953 --> 01:19:11.579
You're sweating.

664
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:15.249
I’ve left.
and there's no coming back.

665
01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.127
Your life is more important
than your novel.

666
01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.754
Than any novel.

667
01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:23.340
Writing is vital to you.
but you need to take care of yourself.

668
01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:28.137
You're too good a person to see
the shit l have inside.

669
01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.806
Stop. that's enough.
l have a confession.

670
01:19:30.974 --> 01:19:34.435
So you see how close l am.

671
01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:38.147
I’ve been reading the novel.
Everything you've written.

672
01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:42.568
At night. when you're asleep.
Do you mind?

673
01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:46.489
l understand why you're so affected.
why you reject it.

674
01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:49.158
and why it's hard for you
to go on.

675
01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:51.243
It can't be easy
living there.

676
01:19:51.411 --> 01:19:55.289
in that house.
with that stormy relationship.

677
01:19:55.457 --> 01:20:00.169
So much repressed desire.
impossible to control.

678
01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:03.756
He's coming between
a mother and her daughter.

679
01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.008
breaking a sacred bond.

680
01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:08.886
But the passion's there. too.
The lust.

681
01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.062
l identify with her.

682
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.523
l understand exactly
how she feels.

683
01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:23.567
Disgusted. guilty. selfish...

684
01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:24.944
Her mom's jealousy...

685
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:27.404
But she's forced to choose

686
01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:29.990
between passionate love
for a man.

687
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.867
and love for a mother.

688
01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:34.662
I’d have chosen the same.

689
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.249
Such decisions
are made by gut instinct.

690
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.834
Sex...

691
01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:42.211
The thick.
burning lust

692
01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.587
filled the mother.

693
01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:46.507
the man and the daughter.

694
01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.384
They were sex-crazed.

695
01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.095
The stench of raw sex...

696
01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.556
The mother and the man.

697
01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.894
the man and the daughter.

698
01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:00.729
the daughter and the man.

699
01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:02.189
All the man's poisoned love...

700
01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:05.276
Alone with the daughter.
the daughter and the man...

701
01:21:05.443 --> 01:21:09.363
The smell was heavy.
hot. overwhelming...

702
01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:12.157
Stuffy... stale air.

703
01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.202
Exhausted.

704
01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:28.507
The paint fell
from the corners of the room

705
01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:32.303
and the walls became rocky.

706
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:35.264
like those in a cave.

707
01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:37.641
A filthy den of...

708
01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:41.103
Get out!

709
01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:43.981
Relax.

710
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:47.151
Just wanted to let you know
that I’m here.

711
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.964
The man was selfish.
a coward.

712
01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:13.552
He hated himself so deeply.
so utterly.

713
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.221
there wasn't even time
for forgiveness.

714
01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:18.432
Only time for death.

715
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.185
Death. death.

716
01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.354
death. death.

717
01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:28.192
Belén's fine.
She's home with her family.

718
01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.194
Forget the whole thing.

719
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:31.987
You've suffered enough.

720
01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:35.449
Will l ever read the novel?

721
01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.451
Of course.

722
01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.706
Another thing.

723
01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:45.376
Tell me about Elena. too.

724
01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.378
My sister writes to her on-line.

725
01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:50.714
She's on that Mediterranean
cooking chat every day.

726
01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:53.133
- Her user name is "Alsi."
- "Alsi"?

727
01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:56.261
A-L-S-l.

728
01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:59.181
That's Spanish
for "island" backwards.

729
01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:01.642
Hi. Alsi.
How are you?

730
01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.522
l don't know you.

731
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:10.609
It’s better that way.
I’m here to help.

732
01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.572
What's your user name?
l don't understand the icon.

733
01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.617
It’s a lighthouse for your island.

734
01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.160
Are you the keeper?

735
01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.246
Yeah.

736
01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:26.834
l have a story for you.
it's full of advantages.

737
01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.169
I’d like that.

738
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.589
Thanks.

739
01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.303
The first advantage
is at the end of the story.

740
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:41.765
It doesn't finish.
it falls in a hole.

741
01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:47.646
And the story
starts again halfway.

742
01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:51.859
The other advantage.
and the biggest.

743
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.945
is that you can change course
along the way...

744
01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:58.240
lf you let me.
lf you give me time.

745
01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:04.872
All the time you want.

746
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.915
Go on. please.

747
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.994
To be continued.

748
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.506
What happened?
Why are you so late?

749
01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:57.800
My boss invited me to dinner.

750
01:24:57.967 --> 01:25:00.928
He wanted me to try a new dish.

751
01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.513
Did you screw him?

752
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.057
What?

753
01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:07.684
Did you go to bed with him?

754
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.858
That's right.
you guessed it.

755
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.824
And how was it?

756
01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:24.284
- Tell me about it.
- No.

757
01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:28.372
You first.
What's going on?

758
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.499
What's your problem?

759
01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.918
l lost track of you ages ago.

760
01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.212
You're not alive!

761
01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:39.424
Was it the first time with him?

762
01:25:39.592 --> 01:25:44.513
The second.
The first was before we met.

763
01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.223
Or should l say
before l proposed?

764
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.142
So it doesn't count.

765
01:25:51.062 --> 01:25:54.940
You could have told me before.

766
01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:57.359
Yeah. l could have.

767
01:25:58.611 --> 01:26:01.321
And today?

768
01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:04.199
Well...

769
01:26:04.367 --> 01:26:06.118
It doesn't count. either.

770
01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:07.870
It’s a lie.

771
01:26:08.037 --> 01:26:09.705
But we came close.

772
01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.002
How close?

773
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.670
Did you stop or did he?

774
01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:19.798
What about you stopping with me?

775
01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:35.606
Lorenzo. do you love me?

776
01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:40.068
l need to hear you say it
right now.

777
01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:47.034
Yes.
Deeply.

778
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:51.205
More than myself.
But I’m lost.

779
01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.165
Then let me help you.

780
01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.125
You don't deserve this.

781
01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.378
Why not?
I’m your girlfriend

782
01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.756
and l love you
more than myself.

783
01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.634
Come on. it's obvious.
You're draining my life away.

784
01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:07.387
I’m doing all l can to get back.
and accept myself.

785
01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.681
but if l can't.

786
01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:13.352
don't wait for me.

787
01:27:13.519 --> 01:27:16.438
l wouldn't. either.

788
01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:19.691
What happened to you?

789
01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:27.366
Belén. it's Elena.

790
01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.953
How are you?

791
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.163
It’s real hot here.

792
01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.874
Why don't you come out?
The sea will do you good.

793
01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:39.127
l have a guesthouse
for the whole summer.

794
01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:42.714
I’ll have a room free in August.
Upstairs.

795
01:27:42.882 --> 01:27:45.926
My best room.
You'll watch the sunset

796
01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.553
from your bed.
Bring someone if you want.

797
01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:50.138
Well?

798
01:27:50.306 --> 01:27:54.810
The truth is.
I’d love to visit an island...

799
01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:56.478
with someone.

800
01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.523
Then that's it.

801
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.692
- It’s difficult. Elena.
- Difficult?

802
01:28:01.859 --> 01:28:05.112
Nothing is here.
All the bad's left behind.

803
01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.157
- Just bring along the good.
- Right.

804
01:28:09.325 --> 01:28:12.411
The good up front.

805
01:28:12.578 --> 01:28:16.331
l really want to see you.
but here.

806
01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:18.917
l don't want to lose touch.

807
01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:22.754
Say you'll come.

808
01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:24.589
Promise me.

809
01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.176
l promise.

810
01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:30.345
I’ll try.

811
01:28:30.513 --> 01:28:32.014
Good bye.

812
01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:08.216
Forgive me. Lucía.
I’ve got to end this.

813
01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:13.722
I’m going to kill them
for once and for all.

814
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.807
Both of them.

815
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.727
Right now.

816
01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:40.248
lf you've stopped being a writer.

817
01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:42.376
you have to explain why.

818
01:29:43.836 --> 01:29:45.921
You're holding back.

819
01:29:51.135 --> 01:29:53.387
lf you don't tell me.
I’ll never forgive you!

820
01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.138
You hear me? Never!

821
01:29:55.306 --> 01:29:58.934
- l can't talk like this.
- Talk?

822
01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:03.146
You're the one who won't talk.

823
01:30:03.314 --> 01:30:04.940
You keep it all inside.

824
01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:07.192
You won't let me help you.

825
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.072
Everything's you.
I’m crumpled up in the corner.

826
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.368
Look.
You were meant to live alone

827
01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:18.912
and to suffer alone.

828
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.997
And to drive yourself
fucking crazy.

829
01:30:21.165 --> 01:30:23.250
which l don't understand.

830
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.293
You're sick. Lorenzo.

831
01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:29.214
Sick of yourself.
of your own standards

832
01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.924
and nothing else.

833
01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.801
Of your fucking secrets!

834
01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:35.679
You keep me around.
but in the dark.

835
01:30:37.014 --> 01:30:39.474
Because my complaints
don't count.

836
01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:43.270
Because you don't give a fuck
what happens to me.

837
01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:45.689
Your troubles are so deep.

838
01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:47.441
I’m fucking stupid.

839
01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:51.445
and all you care about
is if l screw my boss or not.

840
01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.285
I’m exhausted.

841
01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:02.289
You're driving me nuts.
I’ll be late to work.

842
01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:08.044
Enjoy your hole.

843
01:31:08.212 --> 01:31:10.672
Have fun rotting by yourself.

844
01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:23.477
Look. I’ve never been
this mean to anyone.

845
01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:27.063
It’s the last time
I’ll let myself talk like this.

846
01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:30.817
It’s for me.
not you.

847
01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:34.279
That's right.

848
01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:38.325
It’s time to think of myself.

849
01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:41.077
of my own needs.

850
01:31:41.245 --> 01:31:43.914
Because l see
no future with you.

851
01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:38.009
Lucía!

852
01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:41.555
Come over here
and lie next to me.

853
01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.339
Relax. Lucía.

854
01:33:16.507 --> 01:33:19.009
Let the mud
absorb all the bad.

855
01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:22.721
Later it'll wash away
in the sea.

856
01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.925
l don't want sex.

857
01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:04.262
I’m not ready yet.

858
01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:15.523
Don't worry.

859
01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:21.738
We'll just lie here.

860
01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:24.074
drying out in the sun.

861
01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:36.544
Yeah.
he looks like Carlos.

862
01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:47.305
"Missing for 6 months."

863
01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:49.724
"Manuela and Belén Lozano.
mother and daughter.

864
01:34:49.892 --> 01:34:52.727
and Antonio Castillo.
were all living together.

865
01:34:52.895 --> 01:34:57.774
lf anyone knows where they are.
please contact the police."

866
01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:00.610
- The police?
- We'll...

867
01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:02.696
act like we didn't see this.

868
01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:05.198
like nothing's happened.

869
01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:12.330
We know he lived
with two women.

870
01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:14.249
Mother and daughter.

871
01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.459
Yeah.
and the daughter...

872
01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:20.004
What?

873
01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:24.592
The daughter
was taking care of...

874
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.761
my daughter.

875
01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:39.524
They quietly
left without him.

876
01:35:39.692 --> 01:35:42.277
without saying good bye.

877
01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:45.655
As he slept.
like in a dream.

878
01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:49.701
When he woke.
he felt the two lifeless women

879
01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:51.995
were still with him.

880
01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:55.498
like any morning
at that hour.

881
01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:58.460
And he lay still.
wishing his life

882
01:35:58.627 --> 01:36:02.172
would also leave him
through his blood.

883
01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:04.591
What good was his blood now?

884
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:09.137
He wished it softly.
without real intent.

885
01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:12.807
And he chose to escape.
to start over. to be new.

886
01:36:12.975 --> 01:36:15.268
To change his blood.

887
01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:19.606
So he said good bye
and left.

888
01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:25.195
We should give him a chance.

889
01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:29.365
Don't we all deserve one?

890
01:36:31.243 --> 01:36:33.995
Just in case.
if in doubt.

891
01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.623
isn't it better to trust people?

892
01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.416
Right?

893
01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:44.631
So when he gets back.
we'll ask him to explain.

894
01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.925
It’s better this way.

895
01:36:47.092 --> 01:36:49.928
- Especially for you.
- For me?

896
01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:53.056
l just want to forget.

897
01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:55.183
You can't
forget some things.

898
01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:58.603
In this house you can.
That's why we're here.

899
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:02.649
Then it's too late.

900
01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:06.361
l should have come before.

901
01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:08.613
When there was time...

902
01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:13.409
for Lorenzo.

903
01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:18.206
l wanted him
to show me the island.

904
01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:21.751
l asked him to.
but he wouldn't.

905
01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.548
It would have been
his birthday soon.

906
01:37:32.137 --> 01:37:35.390
- What day?
- The 23rd.

907
01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:47.569
Of May?

908
01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:56.160
We could have celebrated
here on the island.

909
01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:59.163
Maybe even with you.

910
01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:02.208
Who knows
if we'd have met. right?

911
01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:04.460
Right.

912
01:38:06.797 --> 01:38:09.966
When was Lorenzo here?

913
01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:12.886
A long time ago.

914
01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.889
- Before we met.
- How long ago?

915
01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:19.100
About six years ago.

916
01:38:21.103 --> 01:38:23.938
Yeah.
l think he turned 25 here.

917
01:38:25.482 --> 01:38:27.358
Lucía...

918
01:38:28.527 --> 01:38:31.279
What is it?

919
01:38:31.447 --> 01:38:33.364
I’m overwhelmed...

920
01:38:33.532 --> 01:38:36.492
But l can't cry.

921
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:40.246
Don't worry.
You don't have to.

922
01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.582
I’m the one
who should cry over him.

923
01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:53.760
I’ll just faint. then.

924
01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.806
It’s the sea.
Must be high tide.

925
01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:12.111
I’ll never cry again.

926
01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:18.201
I’m going to bed.

927
01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:30.004
What's going on?

928
01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:20.346
"Luna.
spring of 1988."

929
01:40:24.935 --> 01:40:27.061
Luna.

930
01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:40.950
"Why bother being a father

931
01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:42.910
if she didn't know?"

932
01:40:44.663 --> 01:40:47.540
He knew then
that if he'd told her.

933
01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:50.668
she'd have kept the secret.

934
01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:58.259
Lucía. never talk to me
about this.

935
01:40:58.427 --> 01:41:00.428
l don't want to hear it.

936
01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:14.901
Well. l do.

937
01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:18.631
He's out diving.

938
01:42:19.675 --> 01:42:21.634
Beneath the island.

939
01:42:24.429 --> 01:42:25.888
Do you like Carlos?

940
01:42:27.683 --> 01:42:31.310
l don't anymore.

941
01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:34.063
Go ahead. he's all yours.
l won't even be jealous.

942
01:42:39.027 --> 01:42:41.028
What are you doing?

943
01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:44.198
Asking a friend for advice.

944
01:42:44.366 --> 01:42:48.077
l don't know him.
but I’m getting to like him.

945
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.627
He's been writing me
since l got here.

946
01:42:56.795 --> 01:43:00.381
He made up
a sweet story to help me.

947
01:43:00.549 --> 01:43:04.302
He taught me to forget.
And to escape pain.

948
01:43:07.222 --> 01:43:09.265
Want to read it?

949
01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:10.933
You could get into it.

950
01:43:11.101 --> 01:43:14.770
It’s full of advantages.

951
01:43:14.938 --> 01:43:19.942
Because in the end.
there's a hole to escape through.

952
01:43:25.991 --> 01:43:29.118
Back to the middle.

953
01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:32.580
To change course.

954
01:43:32.748 --> 01:43:34.874
if you want.

955
01:43:41.089 --> 01:43:44.508
That's his icon.
It’s a lighthouse.

956
01:43:46.386 --> 01:43:49.263
But it has no keeper.

957
01:43:49.431 --> 01:43:53.142
It must be a computer.

958
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:55.811
Maybe his.

959
01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:05.571
You'll meet my daughter.

960
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.078
l can't read this.

961
01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:13.996
Why not?

962
01:44:17.542 --> 01:44:20.336
It will grab me.

963
01:44:20.504 --> 01:44:22.004
And won't let go.

964
01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:25.466
That's good.

965
01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:27.093
Did you finally do it?

966
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.469
Do what?

967
01:44:28.637 --> 01:44:30.263
Change course?

968
01:44:32.015 --> 01:44:35.685
Not all the way.
There wasn't time.

969
01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:37.853
That's why I’m writing him.

970
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:42.733
WHERE'S THE KEEPER?

971
01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.778
Don't write him.

972
01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:51.909
There's nothing more he can do.

973
01:45:00.168 --> 01:45:03.713
Has he written you
since l first got here?

974
01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:16.118
Hi. Lorenzo.
How are you?

975
01:46:16.286 --> 01:46:17.953
Your face says it all.

976
01:46:18.121 --> 01:46:20.456
They called to say
you were more awake.

977
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.670
Do you know who l am?

978
01:46:26.838 --> 01:46:28.881
Pepe.

979
01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:31.050
Thank God.

980
01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:36.847
Glad to have you back.
You'll be writing in no time.

981
01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:40.726
Where's Lucía?

982
01:46:44.773 --> 01:46:46.732
It says here that...

983
01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.819
your cranial hematoma
has subsided.

984
01:46:49.986 --> 01:46:54.323
And the rest of your bruises
are history.

985
01:46:55.367 --> 01:46:57.118
Where's Lucía?

986
01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:04.291
You were in bad shape.

987
01:47:04.459 --> 01:47:07.002
We didn't think you'd make it.

988
01:47:09.005 --> 01:47:10.965
How long have l been here?

989
01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:13.426
Well...

990
01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.970
One week in a coma.

991
01:47:16.138 --> 01:47:18.848
with this horrible respirator...

992
01:47:19.015 --> 01:47:21.225
And two more weeks

993
01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:25.271
breathing on your own.
but unconscious.

994
01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:29.984
And in this room
since four or five days ago.

995
01:47:30.152 --> 01:47:32.945
blabbering in your sleep.

996
01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:36.365
And when you'd wake up.
you were out of it.

997
01:47:41.413 --> 01:47:44.331
We haven't heard from Lucía
in the past four weeks.

998
01:47:44.499 --> 01:47:47.001
l looked everywhere.

999
01:47:47.169 --> 01:47:49.670
She hasn't been to your place.
nor the restaurant

1000
01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:52.423
since the night
of your accident.

1001
01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.975
Lorenzo.

1002
01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:07.688
l think Lucía
believes you're dead.

1003
01:48:07.856 --> 01:48:11.108
That's why she left.
l talked to the ambulance guy.

1004
01:48:11.276 --> 01:48:15.696
He said a cop called your house
and talked to her.

1005
01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:18.157
He mentioned the car

1006
01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:20.826
and she hung up.

1007
01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:23.329
He tried to call back

1008
01:48:23.497 --> 01:48:25.664
but she wouldn't answer.

1009
01:48:26.958 --> 01:48:29.210
l need to pee.

1010
01:48:29.377 --> 01:48:33.297
- Do it there in the pan.
- No way!

1011
01:48:33.465 --> 01:48:34.965
Wait. wait.

1012
01:48:35.133 --> 01:48:37.760
Thanks. Pepe.
but l can manage.

1013
01:48:40.138 --> 01:48:42.306
Lose the attitude.

1014
01:48:42.474 --> 01:48:45.100
I’ve helped you all week.

1015
01:48:45.268 --> 01:48:47.186
You just don't remember.

1016
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.665
l know where she might be.

1017
01:49:09.626 --> 01:49:12.044
You came by car?

1018
01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:14.004
As soon as they called.

1019
01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:43.033
Good morning.

1020
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:46.245
Tell me right now
why you're here and Belén isn't.

1021
01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:49.748
You see?

1022
01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:53.419
l don't want to forget anymore.
Thanks to you. honey.

1023
01:49:56.006 --> 01:49:57.089
Well?

1024
01:49:57.257 --> 01:50:00.342
Won't you answer me?

1025
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:04.847
It’s time to show you
who l really am. no more stories.

1026
01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:09.059
Were you there with Belén.
in my room...

1027
01:50:11.187 --> 01:50:14.356
when that fucking dog
killed my daughter?

1028
01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:17.443
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't?

1029
01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:20.696
Then why are the cops
looking for you?

1030
01:50:24.367 --> 01:50:26.201
Belén was with some guy

1031
01:50:26.369 --> 01:50:29.538
who met her in the park
with your daughter.

1032
01:50:30.665 --> 01:50:34.168
But he disappeared
after that night.

1033
01:50:44.846 --> 01:50:46.263
What about Belén?

1034
01:50:46.431 --> 01:50:50.142
Where is she?
Since you know everything.

1035
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:54.772
She left with her mom.
but didn't tell me where.

1036
01:50:54.939 --> 01:50:58.233
She changed in the end.
and chose her mom over me.

1037
01:51:03.531 --> 01:51:05.282
Can't blame her.

1038
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:09.578
A mother always comes first.

1039
01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:16.293
l don't trust you anymore.
Antonio...

1040
01:51:16.461 --> 01:51:19.213
l won't ask you
any more questions.

1041
01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:21.590
I’ll leave that to the police.

1042
01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:24.760
Lying to them
won't be so easy.

1043
01:51:24.928 --> 01:51:27.471
Look how brave l got
all of a sudden.

1044
01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:29.682
Wait.

1045
01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:33.727
Please don't call the police.

1046
01:51:33.895 --> 01:51:35.562
Why not?

1047
01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:38.524
Are you holding back
anything else?

1048
01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:44.988
I’ve no one left
who l can trust.

1049
01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.117
Where are you going?

1050
01:51:48.284 --> 01:51:52.079
Making a getaway?
They'll track you down!

1051
01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:55.624
lf you call the cops.

1052
01:51:55.792 --> 01:51:57.209
I’ll leave. too.

1053
01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:58.836
Are you stupid?

1054
01:51:59.003 --> 01:52:01.004
Yes.

1055
01:53:00.732 --> 01:53:02.691
Where are you going?

1056
01:53:02.859 --> 01:53:04.651
l don't understand.

1057
01:53:04.819 --> 01:53:08.238
l trust Carlos. and l believe him.
l want to know more.

1058
01:53:08.406 --> 01:53:10.699
That's the easy part.

1059
01:53:10.867 --> 01:53:14.077
Believing what you want.
What pleases you.

1060
01:53:14.245 --> 01:53:16.371
l did that. too.
Until tonight.

1061
01:53:16.539 --> 01:53:19.124
I’ll chase whomever l please!

1062
01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.960
Men matter
less and less to me.

1063
01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:25.464
That's my lot.
They've never given me anything.

1064
01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:26.882
Except sex.

1065
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:30.052
No?
What about the keeper?

1066
01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:34.556
What?
Besides wild sex and a daughter?

1067
01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:39.311
Don't forget that story
full of advantages

1068
01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:40.562
that he wrote just for you!

1069
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:43.524
That's right.

1070
01:53:43.691 --> 01:53:46.360
Maybe your boyfriend
was the last good man on earth.

1071
01:53:46.528 --> 01:53:48.529
No. he wasn't.

1072
01:53:48.696 --> 01:53:52.074
You're wrong.
but that's my business.

1073
01:53:52.242 --> 01:53:55.828
And l suppose Carlos
is also your business.

1074
01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.621
Yours alone.

1075
01:53:57.789 --> 01:54:01.124
You're the only one chasing him.

1076
01:54:01.292 --> 01:54:03.085
Yeah.

1077
01:54:03.253 --> 01:54:04.878
Come to think of it.

1078
01:54:05.046 --> 01:54:08.090
l always chase men.
When l like them.

1079
01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:10.926
To each his own.
right?

1080
01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:16.014
Where could he be?

1081
01:54:17.016 --> 01:54:19.810
l don't know.
I’m going home.

1082
01:54:19.978 --> 01:54:22.020
You guys cook tonight.

1083
01:57:38.676 --> 01:57:41.553
I’m so sorry.

1084
01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.258
Carlos!
It’s me. Lucía.

1085
01:59:01.425 --> 01:59:03.969
l want to come down.
please.

1086
01:59:05.096 --> 01:59:06.763
Come and help me.

1087
01:59:06.931 --> 01:59:09.933
l know how to dive. too.
What did you think?

1088
01:59:16.065 --> 01:59:18.275
Lucía.
It’s me. Elena.

1089
01:59:29.954 --> 01:59:33.039
- Where's Carlos?
- Down there.

1090
01:59:33.207 --> 01:59:34.833
Did he escape?

1091
01:59:37.128 --> 01:59:39.004
Maybe he's dead.

1092
01:59:42.258 --> 01:59:46.428
lf he turns up.
we have to believe him. okay?

1093
01:59:46.596 --> 01:59:48.597
Whatever you want.

1094
01:59:48.764 --> 01:59:51.016
That's right.

1095
01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:53.393
He's a crab.

1096
01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:57.105
Let's go home.

1097
01:59:57.273 --> 01:59:59.733
- What for?
- To eat.

1098
01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:01.735
So early?

1099
02:00:01.903 --> 02:00:03.486
I’m not hungry.

1100
02:00:03.654 --> 02:00:08.074
Tough. It’s about time
you helped me cook.

1101
02:00:08.242 --> 02:00:13.997
We'll make a special meal
and we'll be together and have fun.

1102
02:00:30.348 --> 02:00:33.558
You're a gift to this earth.

1103
02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:37.896
Elena.
You're crying.

1104
02:00:41.275 --> 02:00:44.778
Tears of happiness.
which is what I am from now on.

1105
02:00:44.946 --> 02:00:47.072
Great.
l hope it's contagious.

1106
02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.282
Piece of cake.
Let's go.

1107
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:01.433
The first advantage
is at the end of the story.

1108
02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.978
It doesn't finish.
it falls in a hole.

1109
02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:11.484
And the story
starts again halfway.

1110
02:04:13.028 --> 02:04:16.531
The other advantage.
and the biggest.

1111
02:04:16.699 --> 02:04:19.784
is that you can change course
along the way...

1112
02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:23.329
lf you let me.
lf you give me time.

1113
02:05:07.374 --> 02:05:10.919
A ray of sunshine...
