Yeah. Go on.

and says.

280
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:15.113
"Will You make the king
of Ireland's heart all soft?

281
00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:19.242
'Cause it's gone icy
and like a rock or something."

282
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.954
And God did. and she smiled
and said to the king.

283
00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:28.209
"Will you give me as much land
as this cloak will cover?"

284
00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:29.919
'Cause she was wearing
this cloak.

285
00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.170
just normal size. right?

286
00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:34.215
She bends down.
and the cloak is magic.

287
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.134
with the Holy God Spirit in it.

288
00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.219
and she tells her four sisters
with her...

289
00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.680
They were like
her sidekicks. right?

290
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.765
They take a corner each
and spread it out

291
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.601
all over the land.

292
00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.604
and it goes out for miles.

293
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.064
It's just like a miracle.

294
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.776
And then the king says.
"Well. Brigid. what's the story?

295
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.445
How'd you do that?"

296
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.323
And Brigid says. "It's 'cause
you're being so stingy

297
00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.742
with all the poor people
in your land."

298
00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:04.245
And he says. "All right. then.
you can have loads of me land."

299
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.040
And she gets it
and starts a convent

300
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.459

in the town.

301
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.920

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.549
Dr. O'Toole?

353
00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.884
Listen. it's Sandra.
your cleaner.

354
00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.177
Wake up. Come on.

355
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.350
-Peggy?
-Yeah.

356
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:18.643
Oh. thank God.

357
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:22.813
Dr. O'Toole. it's me.

358
00:25:22.897 --> 00:25:24.941
-Will I call an ambulance?
-(groans)

359
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.193
No.

360
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:28.653
-No. I probably should.
-No. no. no.

361
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.905
-Just to be safe.
-No. It's fine.

362
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:32.990
Stop fussing.

363
00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.826
I must have fainted.

364
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.870
I've not been able to eat.

365
00:25:37.954 --> 00:25:39.789
Are you sure now?
'Cause you have a cut.

366
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:42.541
No. Well. if I was a horse.
they'd shoot me. but I'm not.

367
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:45.461
I'm a doctor. and I'd know if
I needed to go to the hospital.

368
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:48.047
So help me get up.

369
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.715
-Okay.
-Give me a hand.

370
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:51.175
Here. You ready?

371
00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:53.803
(both grunting)

372
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.722
Right. All good. I'm just gonna
walk you back here.

373
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:57.765
Right. Easy.

374
00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:00.268
Sit down there now. Yeah.

375
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:01.978
-(Peggy groans)
-Are you all right?

376
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.105
-Hmm.
-Okay.

377
00:26:04.188 --> 00:26:05.815
Do you feel dizzy or anything?

378
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:11.112
Why didn't you ask me?

379
00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:13.030
Ask you?

380
00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:14.365
Ask you what?

381
00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:17.368
I have designed a house

382
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:21.205
that costs just 35.000 euros
to build.

383
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:23.124
It's a self-build.

384
00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:27.044
so you can literally DIY
a permanent home.

385
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.966
I didn't mean for you
to see that.

386
00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:35.678
Well. I did. so...

387
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.972
here's my proposal.

388
00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:56.073
(birds chirping)

389
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:09.712
PEGGY: It's land. Sandra.
going to waste.

390
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:11.839
Use it.

391
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:13.966
Build a house for you
and your girls.

392
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:17.762
Dr. O'Toole. this...

393
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.851
Why would you do this?

394
00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:26.562
PEGGY: Your mother was far more
than a cleaner to me.

395
00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.232
She was a friend.

396
00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:35.654
She helped me through
some bloody awful times.

397
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.743
I want to give you the land...

398
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.120
and lend you the money
to build your house.

399
00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:47.541
(sniffles)
Not this much.

400
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:52.630
-You can't.
-I can.

401
00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:56.801
And you can pay me back over
as many years as. as we decide.

402
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:01.222
Hmm? What do you say?

403
00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:09.313
(exhales sharply)

404
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.025
Is that a yes?

405
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:18.614
Uh. yeah.
(laughs shakily)

406
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:21.367
(sniffles)
Yeah.

407
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.202
(chuckles)

408
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.662
All right. now get back to work.

409
00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:25.871
Good woman.

410
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.047
(birds chirping)

411
00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:41.929
CIARAN:
These are approximate figures.

412
00:28:42.012 --> 00:28:44.932
so you need to check
all the costs

413
00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.851
before you commit.

414
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.436
Where'd you get this?

415
00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.564
-Uh. online.
-Online. (sighs)

416
00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:54.650
Are these costs
inclusive of VAT?

417
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.027
Value added tax-- are these
prices plus or including?

418
00:28:57.111 --> 00:28:59.113
Yeah. I-I think-- I-I'd say so.

419
00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:01.782
'Cause there's a big difference.

420
00:29:01.866 --> 00:29:02.825
Yeah. I know.

421
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.702
I'll be with you in a sec there.

422
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:09.665
Onduline.
Don't know what that is.

423
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.709
Do you know what thickness
of insulation it is?

424
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.294
There's loads of sizes. like.

425
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.880
Oh. yeah. no. uh...
I'll-I'll ask.

426
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:18.382
Biobase.
Never heard of it.

427
00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:21.802
Wha-What about. um. like.
basic concrete?

428
00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.137
Well. that's actual ready mix.

429
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.306
It's-it's not bags?

430
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.516
No. Concrete would-would have
to come

431
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.934
in a truck. in cubic meters.

432
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:30.728
You'd have to go to Roadstone.

433
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:32.688
Do you mind
if I serve this fella?

434
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.065
Yes. my friend.
what can I get you?

435
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:40.070
Some manners. a bit of courtesy.

436
00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:41.947
-What?
-What?

437
00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:44.492
You're Customer Service.
Serve the customer.

438
00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:47.161
She's only after a price check.
It's not rocket science.

439
00:29:56.587 --> 00:29:58.714
You're throwing away
the good bit.

440
00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:12.811
Can I ask your advice
on something?

441
00:30:14.271 --> 00:30:16.857
I'm building a house.
like a self-build.

442
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:20.361
-Right.
-And I'm only starting. but...

443
00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:22.404
I don't know where to start.
I suppose.

444
00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:29.620
Where's your site?
Have you got a field?

445
00:30:29.703 --> 00:30:32.540
A back garden. A woman I work
for is giving me the land.

446
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:34.625
Giving you it?
Why is she doing that?

447
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:36.961
Trying not to think about it
too much.

448
00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:38.420
I would.

449
00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:41.006
Nobody does anything for
nothing. not in this country.

450
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:44.260
Well. I wouldn't live in it.

451
00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:46.971
but it's a roof and four walls.

452
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:48.222
so what else do you need?

453
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:51.642
You wouldn't come
and have a look.

454
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.143
-would you?
-No. I can't. love.

455
00:30:53.227 --> 00:30:54.937
I have a flue to install.

456
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.730
on a job that's growing arms
and legs.

457
00:30:56.814 --> 00:30:57.898
It's only around the corner.

458
00:30:57.982 --> 00:30:59.275
I can't help you.

459
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:00.526
I can't afford to.

460
00:31:03.404 --> 00:31:06.323
Look. you don't know me.

461
00:31:06.407 --> 00:31:09.994
but I think you worked
with my ex Gary.

462
00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:11.495
Gary Mullen?

463
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.130
(birds chirping)

464
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:45.404
-It's possible.
-PEGGY: But?

465
00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:47.615
You're gonna need somebody
who knows what they're doing.

466
00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:48.991
He means a man.

467
00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:50.367
No. I mean a person
who's qualified

468
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:54.038
to handle compliances.
put in for planning.

469
00:31:54.121 --> 00:31:55.581
Could you be that person?

470
00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:56.624
I don't do contracts.

471
00:31:56.707 --> 00:31:58.042
I haven't done one in ages.

472
00:31:58.125 --> 00:31:59.543
PEGGY:
W-We could pay you.

473
00:31:59.627 --> 00:32:02.004
We could pay you a...
a consultancy fee or--

474
00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:04.965
for an agreed amount of days.

475
00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:06.634
AIDO: Look.
even if you do get planning.

476
00:32:06.717 --> 00:32:08.636
I'm guessing you're gonna want
somebody who's gonna work

477
00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:10.387
every weekend
for next to nothing.

478
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:13.057
I'm no use to you.

479
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.726
And I've just had
a health scare. Dicky ticker.

480
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:18.062
-GRAINNE: There you are!
-PEGGY: Grainne!

481
00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:20.689
Have a word
with the architect. yeah?

482
00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:22.191
See if he has any ideas.

483
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.777
I'm sorry. can't help you.

484
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.238
GRAINNE: Aren't you meant
to be convalescing?

485
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:30.616
What are you doing?

486
00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:33.202
Sorry. but do you know each
other well enough to do this?

487
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:34.912
She's Michelle's daughter.

488
00:32:34.995 --> 00:32:36.246
And Michelle was lovely

489
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.999
and a really good cleaner.
but...

490
00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:40.584
But what?

491
00:32:40.668 --> 00:32:42.753
She used to help herself
to Dad's whiskey.

492
00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:45.589
(laughs) Well. she did us all
a favor there.

493
00:32:45.673 --> 00:32:46.924
I'm sorry. Sandra.

494
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.676
could I just have a moment
with Mum?

495
00:32:48.759 --> 00:32:49.885
No. Sandra. stay.

496
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:52.930
GRAINNE:
Look. at the end of the day.

497
00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:54.807
it's none of my business.
I get it.

498
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.686
It's your land. your choice.
but...

499
00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:04.608
What are you gonna do
about Aisling's den?

500
00:33:04.692 --> 00:33:08.112
-PEGGY: Knock it down.
-SANDRA: I'll let you...

501
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:09.655
-I-I shouldn't be...
-PEGGY: No. Sandra.

502
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:11.365
-See you tomorrow. Dr. O'Toole.
-PEGGY: Come back.

503
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:27.172
What are you doing in the car?
It's not even raining.

504
00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:29.800
"How was your day. Mammy?"
"Grand. thank you. Emma."

505
00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:31.051
How was your day. Mammy?

506
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:33.137
"Grand. thank you. Emma."

-(indistinct shouting)

512
00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:56.869
Yeah. I've been ringing round
loads of builders.

513
00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:58.620
Nobody's gonna work weekends.

514
00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:02.207
CIARAN: You've only got to say
"self-build" to a builder.

515
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:04.293
and he'll run a mile.

516
00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.086
But you are gonna need
an expert.

517
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.921
Honestly.

518
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:10.299
the only person that would
do this for nothing is me.

519
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.925
and I'm not back
till next year.

520
00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:15.804
Can you wait?

Mam. where are we going?

To see a man about a job.

Why?

609
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.630
I'm just going by what
Aido the builder said.

610
00:38:18.714 --> 00:38:20.757
He said that's the rules.
and you've seen him. right?

611
00:38:20.841 --> 00:38:22.634
-Mm-hmm. -You don't want
to mess with him. do you?

612
00:38:22.718 --> 00:38:23.969
-No.
-EMMA: No.

613
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.804

to ourselves. yeah?

00:42:03.355 --> 00:42:05.357
'cause the other night.
yous were up to all hours.

700
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.693
-EMMA: Dad!
-GARY: Oh! (laughs)

701
00:42:08.777 --> 00:42:11.529
Look at the state of you.

702
00:42:11.613 --> 00:42:12.906
You okay. Mols?

703
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.950
Where have yous been playing.
in the bog. is it?

704
00:42:15.033 --> 00:42:17.994
SANDRA:
Emma. Take your sister inside.

705
00:42:18.078 --> 00:42:19.621
-Emma. go on.
-Come on.

706
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:22.499
EMMA:
Come on. Molly.

707
00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:32.092
Sandra. look.
I just wanted to...

708
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:33.051
What are you doing?

709
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:36.263
Yeah. I made you dinner.
Take it.

710
00:42:36.346 --> 00:42:38.139
You're not supposed to be here.

711
00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:40.141
I'm not asking to come in
and eat with yous.

712
00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:42.394
Sandra. geez...

713
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:45.188
I just want them
to have a hot meal.

714
00:42:45.272 --> 00:42:47.399
And you could use one. too.
You're wasting away there.

715
00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:58.159
Thanks.

716
00:42:58.243 --> 00:43:00.620
It's mad. isn't it?

717
00:43:00.704 --> 00:43:03.790
We could all just get
into that car now.

718
00:43:03.873 --> 00:43:05.500
Together. We could just go back.

719
00:43:08.128 --> 00:43:09.629
To what. Gary?

720
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.095
I don't know what's happened.

721
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:30.483
GARY: Oh. that's
a great idea. Sandra.

722
00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:34.195
End up some lonely fuckup
like your ma!

723
00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:36.865
(breathing heavily)

724
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:54.341
(exhales deeply)

725
00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:02.682
(girls chatting indistinctly)

726
00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:18.365
(mechanical whirring)

727
00:44:38.093 --> 00:44:39.469
What are you doing?

728
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:42.263
Taking an action shot
for me Instagram.

729
00:44:42.347 --> 00:44:43.556
Throw that in there again.

730
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.058
No! No photos. Amy.

731
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:47.435
Not of me or the kids
or the site. all right?

732
00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:49.270
And don't put nothing online.

733
00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:51.439
All right. Relax.

734
00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:53.274
Just thought you wanted
to document the thing

735
00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:54.984
like you were
on Grand Designs. no?

736
00:44:55.068 --> 00:44:56.778
No.

737
00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.825
(shoveling)

738
00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:05.203
AIDO:
Far end.

739
00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:07.038
That's it. Side to side.
and towards yourself.

740
00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:08.706
We don't want any dips
in the middle.

741
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.459
We don't want the water
to run off the edges. you know.

742
00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:12.460
Keep coming towards yourself.

743
00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:14.462
Side to side. up and down.

744
00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:15.380
(Sandra gasps. groans)

745
00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:16.673
AIDO:
You all right?

746
00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:20.552
Um. yeah. I just--
I just need. um...

747
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:22.929
I'll be back in a sec.
all right?

748
00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:25.014
(panting)

749
00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:27.058
PEGGY: Okay. put away
your homework now.

750
00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:28.393
Time to eat.

751
00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:33.565
Codeine does nothing
for nerve damage.

752
00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:36.234
Yeah. Well. it helps.

753
00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:39.696
MOLLY: Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma.
Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma.

754
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:41.906
-Look what I made.
-Lovely. love.

755
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.324
-Uh. Molly?
-Yeah.

756
00:45:43.408 --> 00:45:44.868
I think you need the loo.

757
00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:46.244
No. I don't.

758
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:47.871
I can see you holding it in.

759
00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:48.955
Go on.

760
00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:52.709
-You all right. Sandra?
-(exhales)

761
00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:55.044
Listen. we're gonna need
more people next weekend.

762
00:45:55.128 --> 00:45:57.964
We can't keep going with three.
Okay?

763
00:45:58.047 --> 00:45:59.632
Yeah. All right.

764
00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:08.975
Sorry?

765
00:46:09.058 --> 00:46:12.187
Um. this is a bit mad.
but I'm building a house.

766
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.982
like. uh. a self-build thing.
and I need a hand

767
00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:17.358
for a few weekends
over the summer.

768
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:18.818
And I was wondering. like--

769
00:46:18.902 --> 00:46:21.279
and only if it suits
and if you're around.

770
00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:24.365
um. if. if you'd want to help?

771
00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:25.867
Oh. here. I should--
I should. uh...

772
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.993
(school bell ringing)

773
00:46:27.076 --> 00:46:28.786
...write it down for you.
um. it's...

774
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.498
Look. I know I've not been...

775
00:46:31.581 --> 00:46:33.124
Like. I know that
we've not talked much.

776
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.834
but you just always...

777
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.338
Look. here's the address. um...

778
00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:40.840
And. like. there's no pressure.

779
00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:43.301
You're probably busy
or going away.

780
00:46:44.928 --> 00:46:47.180
-Oy!
-MOLLY: We got to watch Moana

781
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:48.223
and play games.

782
00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:49.557
SANDRA:
You did?

783
00:46:49.641 --> 00:46:52.936
So. look. I-I'll l-leave it
with you anyway.

784
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:54.145
Thanks.

785
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:57.106
(indistinct chatter)

786
00:47:00.568 --> 00:47:02.153
SANDRA:
Molly. come on.

787
00:47:02.237 --> 00:47:03.279
MOLLY:
No. No.

788
00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:04.697
SANDRA:
Get out of the wardrobe.

789
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:08.535
-No. I don't want to go.
-We have to go.

790
00:47:08.618 --> 00:47:10.370
Dad won't let her watch Frozen.

791
00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:12.580
Leave me alone.

792
00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:14.332
SANDRA: Molly. will you let go
of the handle?

793
00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:15.416
(tearfully):
No.

794
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.918
Molly. you might trap
your finger.

795
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.127
No.

796
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:19.837
SANDRA:
Come on. Enough.

797
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:22.757
(Molly sniffling. sobbing)

798
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.218
Molly. what is going on?

799
00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:26.803
Come here.

800
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:30.014
(Molly crying)

801
00:47:30.098 --> 00:47:33.643
-Did you...?
-MOLLY: No. No.

802
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:37.146
Come here to me. pet. Come here.

803
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.985
It's all right. It's okay.
Come here. I'm so sorry.

804
00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:43.361
What's wrong?

805
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:48.116
Molly. do you want to play
with Pony?

806
00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:50.368
Did you take that from Peggy's?

807
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:53.913
No. she gave it to us.
It was Aisling's.

808
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:57.292
Aisling's up in heaven
with Granny Michelle.

809
00:47:59.085 --> 00:48:01.588
Do you want to stay
with me today. Molly?

810
00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:02.880
Yeah.

811
00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:06.342
She's not herself.

812
00:48:06.426 --> 00:48:08.720
Could be a kidney infection.

813
00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:10.763
So she wants to stay with me.

814
00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:16.227
Gary.

815
00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:24.777
Hey. Molly?

816
00:48:24.861 --> 00:48:26.738
Do you know
what your Granny Tina's made?

817
00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:29.324
Your favorite. eggy bread.

818
00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.533
There's gonna be none left.

819
00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:33.077
All right. come on.
let's go. Out.

820
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:35.413
-MOLLY: Stop! (screams) -Molly.
stop. will you calm down?

821
00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:36.623
You're being a baby!

822
00:48:36.706 --> 00:48:37.957
Gary. don't hurt her.

823
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:39.667
Oh. the only reason
she's acting up

824
00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:41.461
is 'cause she knows
she can get what she wants.

825
00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:43.755
Now. she's messing both of us
about here. Sandra.

826
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.175
All right. then.

827
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:49.844
Your sister's gonna get
all the treats.

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.658

834
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:13.117
-to give us a hand.
-Oh. my God. Amy.

835

-AIDO: All right. Molly.

851
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.313

852
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:43.856
Command and control.

853
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.525
Good girl. Off you go. then.

Good girl.

855
00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:49.696
-See you later. -Bye. -TOMO:
Bye. Molly. See you later.

856
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:51.656
All right. people. Are we gonna
help this woman build her house?

-ALL: Yeah.
-SANDRA: Deadly.

00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:56.619
All right. Sandra's house
is made up of five frames.

859
00:49:56.703 --> 00:49:59.163
In each frame.
there are two columns.

860
00:49:59.247 --> 00:50:02.125
There's a central piece.
which is 3.400 millimeters long.

861
00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:04.335
or 3.4 meters.

862
00:50:04.419 --> 00:50:08.214
Each column is made up of
seven different pieces of wood.

863
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:11.592
Two are the same. at the top.
two are the same in the middle.

864
00:50:11.676 --> 00:50:13.886
and two are the same
in the bottom.

865
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.097

No. Don't. No. Look--
All right. I'm all right.

1210
01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:30.487
It's better than the crap
you eat in the squat.

1211
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:31.780
If you don't know
what you're eating.

1212
01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:33.031
you don't know
what you're eating.

1213
01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.741
-But I've been told now.
-Well. you do know

1214
01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.827
-what you're eating. -Ah. but
it's in me. it's in me mind now.

1215
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.994
AMY:
You want some salad?

1216
01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:39.705
Yeah. I want to have
a bit of salad.

1217
01:06:39.788 --> 01:06:41.456
-I'll have salad. Yeah.
-Yes. help yourselves to salad.

1218
01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.500
Have you got some salad
down there. Molly and Emma?

1219
01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.043
MOLLY AND EMMA:
No.

1220
01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:46.670
-No. we don't want any salad.
-You should eat some salad.

1221
01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:48.171
-It can't all be...
-No. we're all right.

1222
01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:49.423
-thanks. for salad.
-Eh. it's all right.

1223
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:53.885
MOLLY:
It's so far away.

1224
01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:57.389
Ms. Kelly. I had to sign
for this for you.

1225
01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:01.059
Breach of access?

1226
01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:03.520
That prick is lucky
to see those kids at all.

1227
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:05.605
and now he's taking me to court!

1228
01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.191
Breach of access is an offense.

1229
01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:09.818
You have to attend.

1230
01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.653
You have to tell your side
of the story.

1231
01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:13.405
Oh. great.
Well. shall I get out me A4 pad

1232
01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:14.573
and we'll get started. will we?

1233
01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.783
-Fuck's sake!
-If you fight this

1234
01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:19.745
with that kind of attitude.
he'll win.

1235
01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:21.538
I've seen it. Sandra.

1236
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.998
I've seen men get barring orders

1237
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.416
back against the women
they've hit.

1238
01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:28.420
I'm telling you.
we can either calmly put forward

1239
01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:30.130
your side of the story.

1240
01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.716
or you can go into mediation
ranting and raving

1241
01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.385
and risk losing custody
of the kids altogether.

1242
01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.935
How many visits did Molly miss?

1243
01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.480
I don't know.

1244
01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:50.525
Seven? Eight?

1245
01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:52.152
Oh. Jesus. Sandra.

1246
01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.863
She literally wouldn't get
out of the car. Jo.

1247
01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.156
What was I supposed to do?

1248
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.867
You can't let Molly
dictate terms.

1249
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.119
Is that what you say
to a crying child?

1250
01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:07.375
I'm sorry. love. but legally.
he has a right to do this.

1251
01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:10.212
I know it's frustrating.

1252
01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.260
Any more news
on the house front?

1253
01:08:18.512 --> 01:08:20.138
No.

1254
01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.768
AIDO: This needs to go
up against this porch.

1255
01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:27.103
-Yeah. Got it?
-DARIUSZ: I got it.

1256
01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:31.399
Ah. here's herself. Hello.

1257
01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:33.568
I want one of them
Banham locks for the front door.

1258
01:08:33.652 --> 01:08:35.237
Do you know. do you know
those ones. they.

1259
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.905
like. they flick open
really easy on the inside

1260
01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.031
but then they're real secure?

1261
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:39.282
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I know what they are.

1262
01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:41.034
It's just. you're on a budget.

1263
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:43.912
Well. I want one.

1264
01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.206
Well. you can't afford one.

1265
01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:48.124
Jesus.

1266
01:08:48.208 --> 01:08:51.253
Aido. you ask me
for a million decisions a day.

1267
01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.630
and then I finally give you
a freebie. and it's--

1268
01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:57.425
and it's fucking "Why. why.
why." or it's. or it's too much.

1269
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.928
Fuck's sake!

1270
01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.680
Will you stop looking at me?!
Stop looking at me!

1271
01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:02.931
Just get back on with it.
will you?

1272
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.267
The house is never
gonna get done.

1273
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.434
ROSA:
Sandra.

1274
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.105
SANDRA: Oh. will you stop
bleeding staring at us?

1275
01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:12.774
ROSA: Sandra. Sandra.
What is going on?

1276
01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.321
What the fuck is the point?

1277
01:09:18.405 --> 01:09:19.781
(sobs)

1278
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:23.660
Jesus Christ.

1279
01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.786
ROSA:
What?

1280
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:27.163
I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry.

1281
01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.547
(whimpering)

1282
01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.468
What is the point of a house...

1283
01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.972
...if I have no kids
to put in it?

1284
01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.443
Sandra...

1285
01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.903
we should go.

1286
01:09:57.986 --> 01:09:59.988
(exhales deeply)

1287
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.383
(sniffs)

1288
01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:28.892
-Maybe I should ring the girls.
just... -Oh. the girls are fine.

1289
01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:32.062
I spoke to Rosa.
They're happy out. You relax.

1290
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.952
I have a present for you.

1291
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.246
From Amy.

1292
01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:58.463
Hope it's only tobacco.

1293
01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.385
There's Jo.

1294
01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:09.015
Was there a reason
you didn't leave sooner?

1295
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:13.103
I... I did try to.

1296
01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.563
Uh. I-I wanted to.
loads of times.

1297
01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:18.566
I-I made a safety box.

1298
01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:22.237
I just didn't have
anywhere to go.

1299
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.781
Mr. Mullen. you claim that Molly
hasn't attended access

1300
01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.282
on eight occasions?

1301
01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.243
-Yes. Judge. -You've been
keeping up maintenance?

1302
01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.828
Yes. Judge.

1303
01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:31.496
Okay. Ms. Breen.

1304
01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:32.914
Thank you. Judge.

1305
01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:36.334
Ms. Kelly. last time we spoke.
you described suffering

1306
01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.336
psychological and physical abuse

1307
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.754
throughout your relationship.

1308
01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:42.340
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

1309
01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:44.592
And when I specifically
asked you whether Mr. Mullen

1310
01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:46.845
had ever harmed your children.
you said no.

1311
01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.138
Is that correct?

1312
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.806
Yes.

1313
01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:53.935
Do you believe he has
harmed them on access visits?

1314
01:11:54.019 --> 01:11:55.979
No.

1315
01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.981
BREEN: Your Honor. we have
new evidence to bring to court.

1316
01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.817
Articles 1. A to C. are photos

1317
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.569
of Mr. Mullen's eldest child
Emma.

1318
01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.031
On Sunday. August 7.

1319
01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.158
Emma was dropped at her father's
place of residence

1320
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:10.869
with a bandage on her left arm.
as you can see.

1321
01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:12.662
When questioned about this.
Emma said she hurt it

1322
01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:15.790
"making something
in the garden with Mammy."

1323
01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.542
This did not match

1324
01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.294
what Mr. Mullen
was told by Ms. Kelly.

1325
01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.628
who claimed it happened
in the hotel.

1326
01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:23.798
where they temporarily reside.

1327
01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:26.051
We have evidence that suggests
that Emma was indeed

1328
01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:28.386
"making something in the garden"

1329
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.638
of a Dr. Margaret O'Toole.

1330
01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:33.475
who is. in fact. allowing
Ms. Kelly to build a house

1331
01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.101
-at her property.
-Judge. I-I--

1332
01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:36.811
-Judge. I can. I can explain...
-Please wait. Ms. Kelly.

1333
01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:38.813
Ms. Breen. what relevance
does that have to this hearing?

1334
01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:40.565
The matter is
for another courtroom.

1335
01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.525
BREEN: Judge. if this hearing
is about the character

1336
01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:43.985
of these parents and which one

1337
01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.112
is a more suitable guardian
to the children.

1338
01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:47.655
it's certainly worth noting

1339
01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:49.699
that Ms. Kelly did not inform
Dublin City Council

1340
01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:52.952
about this build
or her change of circumstances.

1341
01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:55.455
No. Dr. O'Toole got planning.
Uh. it was her property.

1342
01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.583
BREEN: And Ms. Kelly lied
on an assessment form.

1343
01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:01.544
When asked in June of this year
if you'd received a loan

1344
01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:04.172
or had other housing options.
you wrote "N/A."

1345
01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.466
"not applicable." did you not?

1346
01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.219
I-I-I didn't lie.

1347
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.387
BREEN:
Well. it's on that form. Sandra.

1348
01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:13.556
Are you trying to get two houses
instead of one?

1349
01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.266
No. No.

1350
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:16.851
Judge. is this a fit mother?

1351
01:13:16.935 --> 01:13:19.354
No. You're not doing this!

1352
01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.857
You are not doing--
you are not taking my kids!

1353
01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:25.235
JUDGE:
All right. all right.

1354
01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:28.238
20 minutes' break while
I go over this new evidence

1355
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.281
and your client calms herself.

1356
01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:32.200
GRAINNE:
They might take the girls

1357
01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:34.911
because she fudged
some bloody form?

1358
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.412
JO:
Yes. Yes. they might.

1359
01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:39.415
Because when it comes
to legally binding forms.

1360
01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.376
you have to tell the truth.

1361
01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.671
Truth in the right tone
of voice. though. isn't it?

1362
01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.131
Tell the truth?

1363
01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:47.799
Don't tempt me.

1364
01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.260
I'll be here all fucking week.

1365
01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:54.097
(breathing heavily)

1366
01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.602
Come here to me.

1367
01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:04.149
Of course you were gonna stay
on the housing list.

1368
01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:05.775
Anything could have happened.

1369
01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:07.902
-Yeah. but look what I've done.
-Sandra.

1370
01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:10.071
you're building a home
for your children.

1371
01:14:10.155 --> 01:14:12.240
You're working day and night
to give them

1372
01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.367
a childhood
that they've been denied.

1373
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.827
and then. every weekend.

1374
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.704
you have to drop them home
to that fucker.

1375
01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.290
Do they have any idea
what that takes?

1376
01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.375
I can't. I can't lose them.

1377
01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.585
-No.
-I can't lose...

1378
01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.837
And you won't. you won't.
Come on.

1379
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:27.922
You won't.

1380
01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.676
I know you didn't stop Molly
going to see her father.

1381
01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:35.096
She didn't want to.
and you listened to her.

1382
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.390
I'm so impressed by you. Sandra.

1383
01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:40.852
You know...

1384
01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:43.438
most of us get so sunk
in our own pain.

1385
01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:47.817
we don't notice our children's.
but you did.

1386
01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:49.319
And that makes you
a good mother.

1387
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:51.362
and they've got to see that.

1388
01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.618
You know. Jo's right.

1389
01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:59.495
You go out there
and you tell them the truth.

1390
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.750
All right?

1391
01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.336
-(sniffles)
-Oh.

1392
01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.504
One more thing.

1393
01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:11.591
Come here.

1394
01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:16.304
(Sandra sniffles)

1395
01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.685
There.

1396
01:15:22.769 --> 01:15:24.062
There's Sandra.

1397
01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:28.316
(Sandra sniffles)

1398
01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.112
JUDGE: Mr. Mullen. has Emma
recovered from her injury.

1399
01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.697
in your opinion?

1400
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.742
Yes. Judge. but I don't want me
kids in an unsafe environment.

1401
01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:39.035
Unsafe?

1402
01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:41.246
-Ms. Kelly.
-Gary. that was a scrape.

1403
01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.581
How many times has Emma done
that coming off her scooter?

1404
01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:44.958
JUDGE:
Okay.

1405
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.418
Let's just for a moment
look at the facts here.

1406
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.881
The report says Molly has missed
eight access visits.

1407
01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:53.216
Mr. Mullen hasn't missed one.

1408
01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.759
He's paid child maintenance.

1409
01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.594
He's done everything
that was legally required.

1410
01:15:56.678 --> 01:15:58.388
SANDRA:
Because that's what he does.

1411
01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.306
He does what's required.
but that's not...

1412
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.433
Fact. Ms. Kelly.
Whereas you have not.

1413
01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:04.435
Why is that?

1414
01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.148
Ask better questions.

1415
01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.692
I beg your pardon?

1416
01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.027
Ask him why he's using
the children as pawns

1417
01:16:13.111 --> 01:16:14.862
in front of us all.

1418
01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:18.574
while we're all wondering why
I didn't fill in a form right?

1419
01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:21.786
(scoffs)

1420
01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:24.122
You want to know
why I didn't let Molly go?

1421
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.376
Because she was hiding
in the wardrobe...

1422
01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:31.504
pissing on herself...

1423
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.632
because she was so scared
of seeing you.

1424
01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.594
She saw. Gary.

1425
01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.347
She saw you that day.

1426
01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:46.477
She watched you punch my face
and pull my hair

1427
01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:48.062
and wreck my hand.

1428
01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:51.274
And you didn't see her.
but she saw.

1429
01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:55.028
And I can't make her unsee that.

1430
01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:59.032
But. Christ. I'm her mother
and I'll listen.

1431
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.619
I'd do it again.

1432
01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.998
I would.

1433
01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.167
I'd do it a million times over.

1434
01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:15.089
And making out
that I'm a bad person?

1435
01:17:15.173 --> 01:17:17.258
That I'm a bad mother?

1436
01:17:17.342 --> 01:17:19.844
When you all know
what he did to me?

1437
01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:23.473
You all know
from the Garda reports

1438
01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.682
and the medical reports.

1439
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.601
and yet you still bring me
in here

1440
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.478
and you put me through this.

1441
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.480
sit me in the same room
with him.

1442
01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:32.482
ask me questions like.

1443
01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.942
"Why didn't you leave him?"

1444
01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:38.821
But you never ask.
"Why didn't he stop?"

1445
01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:46.454
Ms. Kelly. take a seat.

1446
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.233
This type of injury could have
come from a playground.

1447
01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:17.235
a tumble in the street.

1448
01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:19.153
But it didn't. Ms. Kelly.

1449
01:18:19.237 --> 01:18:20.696
It happened in your care.

1450
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.325
Albeit while you were in
the process of building a house.

1451
01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.868
to secure
your children's future.

1452
01:18:27.829 --> 01:18:30.415
I understand Molly has witnessed
something she shouldn't.

1453
01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:33.709
but I cannot condone
parental alienation.

1454
01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:36.504
I order that the children be
assessed in the coming months

1455
01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:39.632
to establish their needs.
what they truly want.

1456
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.094
But for now...
the terms of access remain.

1457
01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:46.764
Mr. Mullen.
you will not get custody today.

1458
01:18:46.848 --> 01:18:49.517
(Sandra sighing)

1459
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.644
However. Ms. Kelly.

1460
01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.187
if you want to build yourself
a house.

1461
01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:55.231
you must take
full responsibility for that.

1462
01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.442
You must inform
Dublin City Council

1463
01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:59.902
that you wish to be taken off
the housing list.

1464
01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:01.362
Your right to rent allowance
will cease

1465
01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:03.406
when you and the children move
into this new house.

1466
01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.867
-Understood?
-Yes. Judge.

1467
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.660
Very well.

1468
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.744
CLERK:
The court is adjourned.

1469
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.414
All rise.

1470
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:12.457
(indistinct chatter)

1471
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.418
(chuckles)

1472
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.129
I'm keeping me kids.
(laughs)

1473
01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:21.174
-Oh. shit. your hip.
-Oh. bugger the hip.

1474
01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:24.469
I'm so happy for you.

1475
01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:26.762
(both sigh. chuckle)

1476
01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:37.106
Oh. Thanks.

1477
01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:42.320
(Sandra sighs)

1478
01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:43.738
SANDRA:
Guess what. girls.

1479
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:46.908
Aido said we can move in
in three days.

1480

-EMMA: Cool.

1481

1482
01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.831
MOLLY:
Oh. my God.

1483
01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:57.084
EMMA:
Oh. no. Molly.

1484
01:19:57.168 --> 01:19:58.836
Wow.

1485
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.505
This is such a cool bedroom.

1486
01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:02.256
EMMA:
I know. I love it.

1487
01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.719
Can you imagine
sleeping here now. Molly?

1488
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:09.722
(girls continue chatting
indistinctly)

1489
01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:15.102
(birds chirping)

1490
01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.498
SANDRA:
Oh. my God.

1491
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:38.251
-Girls!
-EMMA: Wow.

1492
01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.711
-Wait for me.
-EMMA: Molly. come look.

1493
01:20:40.795 --> 01:20:42.672
Did you see the table?

1494
01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:45.132
This. Dariusz made this.
It's lovely. isn't it?

1495
01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:46.342
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1496
01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.677
(all chuckling)

1497
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.888
-All we need now is the chairs.
-Mm-hmm.

1498
01:20:50.972 --> 01:20:52.557
Or we can be
just sitting like this.

1499
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.516
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1500
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.600
ALL:
Surprise!

Congratulations. you ledge!

-You did the kitchen?

1504
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.190
Uh. that was mainly me.

1505
01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:03.859
Me hole. was it.
Yewande was at it all day.

1506
01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.570
-SANDRA: Oh. thanks.
-Here.

1507
01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:08.823
-From all of us.
-Oh. my God.

1508
01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:10.324
Look at the box.

1509
01:21:10.408 --> 01:21:12.368
Oh. look.

1510
01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.829

1511
01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.205
-Thanks a million!
-(laughter)

1512
01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:18.749
-Come here. will you take
a picture? -Ah. yeah. go on.

1513
01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.876
Yewande and everyone.
will you get up on the stairs?

1514
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.962
Oh. yeah. We're allowed
photographs now. are we?

1515
01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.380
All right. smart-ass.

1516
01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.674
Come on. it's a group photo.
Get in there. yeah.

Eggs. sausages.

but what we achieved here
has made me very. very proud.

1538
01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:21.103
And it puts me in mind of
the old Irish term meitheal.

-Huh? Meth-head?
-Meitheal.

1540

Francis. you explain
to the young ones

what meitheal means

1542
01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.402
while I teach this idiot
some manners.

1543
01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:32.073
Meitheal means where
people come together

1544
01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:33.574
to help each other.

1545
01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:36.494
And by doing that.
they are helped in return.

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:38.287
