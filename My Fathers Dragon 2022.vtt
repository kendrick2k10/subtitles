00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.500
<i>My father was born a long time ago.</i>

4
00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:26.083
<i>but he was a child like any other.</i>

5
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.625
<i>prone to scraped-up knees</i>
<i>and flights of fancy.</i>

6
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.583
-Have you found it?
-Not yet.

7
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:36.708
<i>He was always good</i>
<i>at finding things.</i>

8
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:40.291
-Yes! I got it. Mom.
-Are there any lollipops left?

9
00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:43.416
<i>That's him there.</i>
<i>just in case you were wondering.</i>

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.333
Got 'em.

11
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.833
-Coming through!
-Morning. Elmer.

12
00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.000
Morning. everyone.

13
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.875
<i>Whatever his mom</i>
<i>called for. he could get it in no time.</i>

14
00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.208
Hey. Mr. Linson.

15
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.208
Morning. Elmer.

16
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.500
-Ooh.

17
00:00:58.583 --> 00:00:59.666
Be careful. Rosie.

18
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.541
There you are. Elmer.

19
00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.041
Just in time
for Mr. Williams's sugar craving.

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.541
Ah. strawberry is my favorite.

21
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:15.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.000
And to think that man is a dentist.

23
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:26.250
Have you got any rubber bands? You know.
the kind that keeps beards out of soup?

24
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.666
-Elmer?
-I'm on it.

25
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.291
<i>Now.</i>
<i>my father would soon set foot in places</i>

26
00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:34.208
<i>no child had ever been before.</i>

27
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.125
Here you go.

28
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.208
<i>Dangerous. wild.</i>
<i>strange places.</i>

29
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:42.208
<i>but he didn't know that yet.</i>

30
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.041
Elmer. can you help me?

31
00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.500
-Morning. Dela.
-Morning.

32
00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:47.500
Morning. Elmer.

33
00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:50.250
-Morning. Magda.
-What have you got for us today?

34
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.833
Tangerines.

35
00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.875
Everyone likes them
because they are easy to peel.

36
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.083
-Check 'em out.
-How much are you asking?

37
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:01.625
-Uh. for you. 30.
-Hmm. What do you think. Elmer?

38
00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.125
Well. these ones
from the bottom are overripe.

39
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.458
-They're sprouting from the inside.
-Oh. so I see.

40
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:09.416
We'll give you half on the tangerines.

41
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.041
Twenty-five. Dela.
That's the best I can do.

42
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.416
Twenty. and I'll take another load
from you next month.

43
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.541
Your mom drives a hard bargain. Elmer.

44
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.750
<i>My father lived</i>
<i>in a world</i>

45
00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:23.500
<i>that seemed like it would go on forever.</i>

46
00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.666
<i>But then it all began to change.</i>

47
00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.916
<i>and times got hard for a while.</i>

48
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.333
What do we do now. Mom?

49
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.583
You don't have to worry about a thing.
That's my job. Elmer.

50
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.791
Maybe if we stay here.
our customers will come back.

51
00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:50.375
and it'll be okay again.

52
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:53.166
I'm afraid the world
doesn't work like that.

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.541
-But I'll get us a new home in the city.
-A new store?

54
00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:01.083
-Sure. Of course.
-But we have nothing left to sell.

55
00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:03.916
Oh. You're right.

56
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.375
We'd better get some stock together
so we'll be ready for a grand opening.

57
00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:11.333
We don't need much.
just a few things to get us started.

58
00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:14.208
There's a strawberry lollipop.
It's kinda broken though.

59
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.500
We could sell it cheaply
and still make enough to buy some more.

60
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.791
You think you could find
more things to sell?

61
00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.000
That's it. That's all there is.

62
00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:39.166
-You're so good at finding things.

63
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.875
We've even got a little bit of money left.

64
00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.250
-It'll get us started.

65
00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.333
Ready for an adventure?

66
00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:47.625
Ready.

67
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.708
Read all about it! Recession hits!

68
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.541
Who's gonna make it. and who's sunk?

69
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.500
Read all about it.

70
00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.500
This is it.

71
00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.291
-Really?
-Yep.

72
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.208
Nevergreen City. our new home.

73
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:09.625
Look. Elmer.

74
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.458
Wouldn't that make a fine store for us?

75
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.375
But… it's all boarded up.

76
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:18.500
Can you imagine what it would look like

77
00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:21.333
with a little bit of paint
and some attention?

78
00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:22.458
Can you see it?

79
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:24.916
I guess.

80
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.875
We could put some bright lights
on the windows.

81
00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:32.041
And before we know it.
we'll feel right at home.

82
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.250
It will take me some time
to save up for all of that.

83
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:42.208
But when I do.
we'll have all we need to get started.

84
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.041
Don't let go of it.

85
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.083
Don't worry. Mom. I won't let go.

86
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.541
Our own store again.

87
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.541
Just like it was before. right?
Just like home.

88
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:54.625
Just like it. Trust me. okay?

89
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:56.250
Okay.

90
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.666
We just have to open these doors. Ready?

91
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.333
One.

92
00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:03.083
two…

93
00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.958
-…three!

94
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:07.375
-Out of my way! Come on!
-Whoa!

95
00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:09.458
The cat's too fast
for me. Callie.

96
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:11.375
-Watch it. kid.
-Catch her!

97
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.833
Elmer! Elmer!

98
00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.583
-Elmer. stay close to me.

99
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.958
Come on. Help me with this.

100
00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:25.750
We've got to take it
all the way up to the top.

101
00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:38.458
-You didn't say anything about a kid.
-I didn't think it'd be a problem.

102
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.625
Well. kids cost extra.
Four months' deposit upfront.

103
00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:43.166
But… that's ridiculous.

104
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.791
Kids are loud and rough on furniture.

105
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.875
But there isn't any furniture.

106
00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:52.416
That's 'cause the last kid broke it all.

107
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.750
Uh. well. the ad said fully furnished.
so I can only give you a week's deposit.

108
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:02.916
Please. Mrs. McClaren.

109
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.625
We've come a very long way.
and this is a new start for us.

110
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:09.541
We even brought our own chairs.

111
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.583
Three weeks.

112
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.708
Oh. great.

113
00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:20.416
Sorry. but you can't trust anyone
these days.

114
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.458
-Nothing personal.
-Yes. of course. I understand.

115
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.083
And no pets.
Pets are worse than kids.

116
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.416
No pets. We don't have any pets.

117
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.291
Rent's due every Tuesday.

118
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:33.250
and there's not an excuse I haven't heard.
so don't bother.

119
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:36.208
-You got it?
-Yes. I get it. Tuesday. rent due.

120
00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.625
Hey. Mom. I can see our store from here.

121
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.708
Come on. It's a great view.

122
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:50.041
Then that makes
this apartment the perfect spot.

123
00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:55.250
Here. we can save up
for the store in this.

124
00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:00.375
Soon. it'll be just like home.

125
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.333
I think I'm getting a hang of these pipes.

126
00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:42.333
What'd you say?

127
00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:44.416
I said I figured out
how to not get splashed.

128
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.041
That's great. Elmer.

129
00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:59.708
-Hello. Mrs. McClaren.

130
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:01.416
Look. Elmer. We have a visitor.

131
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.750
Hello. Mrs. McClaren. How are you today?

132
00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:08.166
Well. it's Tuesday.
I hear a lot of sob stories on Tuesdays.

133
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.708
-It makes my indigestion flare.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

134
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.750
Your rent's due.

135
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.750
The pipes in here rumble and spray water.

136
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:19.791
I'll pay you half this week
and half every week

137
00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:21.208
until the pipes are fixed.

138
00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:24.583
Look. I fix the pipes.
I got to charge you more.

139
00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:28.875
Everything costs money. Dela.
Don't you think I got troubles of my own?

140
00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.166
-Wait. Mom!
-See you next week.

141
00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:37.166
I'll figure out a way
to fill our savings jar.

142
00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:42.000
And then you won't have to worry anymore.
It'll just be you. me. and our new store.

143
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.333
I need to borrow some change. all right?

144
00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:46.791
-But that's the money--
-I need to make calls.

145
00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:48.333
Come outside with me.

146
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:53.875
Don't use them all up. Mom.

147
00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:59.083
-We can't get our store without it.
-It's just a few coins. No big deal.

148
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.583
-How are we gonna--
-Hello.

149
00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.583
Yes. yes. I'm calling about the ad.

150
00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:05.416
I have my own truck. It's… it's gone?

151
00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.583
-All right. Bye.
-Mom?

152
00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:10.916
It's okay. Just one more.

153
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.791
Hello. Hi. I'm calling about the ad.

154
00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:17.875
Wait. I have my own truck.
and the first delivery is free. All right.

155
00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:22.583
But. Mom. maybe I can help.

156
00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:25.250
I just need you to be quiet. Hello.

157
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.583
Yes. yes. I'm calling about the ad.

158
00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:32.291
No. wait! You don't understand.
You see. I have my own truck…

159
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.791
Get off of me!

160
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:07.833
Callie. help!

161
00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:10.541
-Shoo! Shoo! Go. go. go!

162
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:13.291
-Get your milk someplace else.

163
00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:14.666
Are you okay. Gertie?

164
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:16.250
Uh-huh.

165
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.208
-You ready. Eugene?
-I'm ready!

166
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:20.208
And… hit it!

167
00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:27.958
'Tis a dark and dreary night!

168
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.000
Aha!

169
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.125
The wind is howling.

170
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:40.208
A far-off land teeters
at the very edge of oblivion.

171
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.500
Thank you very much.

172
00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.750
The animals cry out.

173
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:46.791
"Is there no one who can save us?"

174
00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.041
Thank you.

175
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:52.541
Yes! Yes! There is one who can save them.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:57.333

190
00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:38.666
You took our customer!
She was about to put that coin in <i>my</i> hat.

191
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.125
Well. it's mine now.

192
00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:44.375
No. it's not.
'Cause we were here first doin' our show.

193
00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:48.041
Uh. looks like your show
isn't as spectacular as rubber bands.

194
00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:53.541
Okay. Here's how it's going to be.
You're either going to give me that coin.

195
00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:56.791
or you're gonna give me
something out of that backpack.

196
00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:59.500
-No.
-You must have something for our show.

197
00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:02.125
-It's mine.
-But you owe me. Fair is fair.

198
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:03.875
-No. I don't!

199
00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.250
-Do so.

200
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.000
-Get off!

201
00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.500
I got it. Callie!

202
00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.125
-Hey! Those kids--
-Come on.

203
00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:17.500
-We have to get back inside.
-Come back here!

204
00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:19.708
You take from me. I take from you.

205
00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:21.125
-They took--
-Please. come on.

206
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:23.958
I'm tired.
and I have to cook supper. Okay?

207
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.583
They…

208
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.250
Hey there.

209
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.750
How did you get in here?
Did you follow me?

210
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.000
I'll be back in a minute.

211
00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.708
Don't drink all of that.
We need some for breakfast.

212
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:04.625
Okay.

213
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:09.000
-Shh!

214
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:11.916
You've got to be quiet.
No pets allowed in the apartment.

215
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.083
-Did you say something?
-No. Mom.

216
00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:16.791
-Come and eat before it gets cold.
-I'm coming.

217
00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:18.541
-Shh!

218
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:21.875
Don't make a sound.
I'll figure something out.

219
00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.791
Hmm! That smells really nice. Mom!

220
00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.541
Hey. look at that.

221
00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:33.625
Mom. I--

222
00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:35.958
Are you trying to get us thrown out
on the street?

223
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:39.000
'Cause if you are.
this is a good way to go about it.

224
00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:41.958
-You don't understand.
-There's nothing to understand.

225
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:46.083
Put the cat back wherever you found it.
or Mrs. McClaren will tell us to go!

226
00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:49.916
-But. I didn't--
-I don't care. I don't have time for this.

227
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.750
-I can explain.
-I've had enough.

228
00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.500
You're about to lie.
and I don't wanna hear it.

229
00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:59.208
You're the liar! You told me
we'd start up our store right out there!

230
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:01.166
It's not that simple.

231
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.416
But you promised!

232
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.208
I didn't mean right now.

233
00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:08.541
-Why don't you tell me the truth?
-You want me to tell you the truth?

234
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:12.750
I needed you to get out of the truck.
That's all.

235
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:16.083
And now I need you to get
that cat out of this apartment!

236
00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.750
Because I have enough
to worry about. okay?

237
00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:22.500
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.833
Don't be scared.

239
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.833
I'm not scared!

240
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:32.208
I'll get the money.
and I'll open the store myself.

241
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:33.416
You'll see.

242
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.291
-Elmer.

243
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:39.208
Hey! No runnin' on the stairs!

244
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.916
-Is that a cat?

245
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.625
What in the world is going on?

246
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45.833
I'm doing this all by myself. Elmer.

247
00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:58.875
Elmer!

248
00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:10.666
<i>What do we do now. Mom?</i>

249
00:16:11.291 --> 00:16:14.250
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to worry about a thing. That's my job.</i>

250
00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.875
<i>That's my job.</i>

251
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.250
-<i>Maybe I can help.</i>
-<i> I just need you to be quiet.</i>

252
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:23.916
<i>Hey! You come back here!</i>

253
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.875
<i>That money belongs to us.</i>

254
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.083
-<i>That's mine!</i>
<i>Get him!</i>

255
00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:31.833
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

256
00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:33.375
<i>You didn't say anything about a kid.</i>

257
00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:34.916
<i>I didn't think it'd be a problem.</i>

258
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.583
<i>Kids cost extra.</i>

259
00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:38.875
<i>I have enough to worry about. okay?</i>

260
00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.458
-<i>Elmer.</i>

261
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.791
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

262
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.333
Hey. cat.

263
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.666
Why is everything so hard?

264
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:08.625
Are you asking me. or…

265
00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:10.708
Whoa!

266
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:11.666
Oh.

267
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.583
You were just talking to yourself.
I get it.

268
00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:15.208
You're…

269
00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:17.875
-Whoa.
-Elmer. Elmer?

270
00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:22.000
Oh. for goodness' sake. Elmer!

271
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:26.416
No.
You're… a talking cat? No. no. no.

272
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.375
Let me know when you're ready.
and I'll answer any questions you have.

273
00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.958
How… how come you can talk?

274
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:40.541
You were kind to me.

275
00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:45.458
So now I'm gonna return
that kindness… to you. Elmer.

276
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:50.000
Um. are you. like.
gonna grant me seven wishes?

277
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:52.208
I am not that kind of magic.

278
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.625
And isn't it usually three wishes?

279
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.208
Well… I need a lot of help.

280
00:17:57.291 --> 00:18:00.916
I need to open a store for my mom and me
so she doesn't have to worry anymore.

281
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:03.750
But I haven't got any money. and--

282
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.708
And this is where I can help.

283
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.666
See. I don't just talk. I listen.

284
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.125
Down here at the docks.
I hear about all kinds of things.

285
00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:15.375
Things that might earn
a young person like yourself

286
00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:17.750
the money you need to open your store.

287
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:19.125
Like what?

288
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:22.541
An amazing. spectacular.

289
00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:24.750
real live.

290
00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:29.458
flying. fire-breathing… dragon!

291
00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:33.583
Yeah. no. Dragons aren't real.

292
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.875
Neither are talking cats.

293
00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:42.958
Can't you just imagine having your
very own dragon here in Nevergreen City?

294
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.291
Yeah. but how--

295
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:47.708
Just imagine.

296
00:18:55.541 --> 00:18:59.458
You and your mom won't have to worry
about another thing.

297
00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:04.791
Wow.

298
00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:08.958
I could sell rides
and candy and souvenirs!

299
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:11.583
And Mom and I
could finally start our store!

300
00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:14.458
Tell me where the dragon is.
How do I get it?

301
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:16.041
That's the easy part.

302
00:19:16.916 --> 00:19:21.333
It's just sitting there…
on this little. tiny island.

303
00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:23.833
But how do I get to the island?

304
00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:25.541
That's easy too.

305
00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:26.958
I got you a ride.

306
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:28.833
-Whoa!

307
00:19:36.083 --> 00:19:38.375
-Say hello to Soda.

308
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.875
That kinda tickles a little. Uh.

309
00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:43.791
Soda.

310
00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.208
-Yes?
-Say hello.

311
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:49.958
-Hello!

312
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:51.458
Uh. he's… he's got it. Soda.

313
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.916
I'm supposed to ride
a whale to the island?

314
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:57.375
It's the best I could do on short notice.

315
00:19:57.458 --> 00:19:58.375
Uh.

316
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.625
Okay. okay. Phew.

317
00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:05.458
I… I just gotta figure out how to hold on.

318
00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:07.875
-Soda?
-Elmer!

319
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.833
Take me to the island with the dragon.
Please?

320
00:20:13.916 --> 00:20:15.541
-Soda!
-Yes. yes. Cat?

321
00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:18.041
Better get going as fast as you can.

322
00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:19.583
Yee-haw!

323
00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:22.208
Or slow! Slow's okay too!

324
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:24.416
Woo! Have a good time. Bye!

325
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.166
He's such a good kid.
Hope he doesn't drown or get eaten.

326
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.083
Or both.

327
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:40.625
Soda. slow down!
I got nothing to hold on to!

328
00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:44.291
But I promised the cat I'd go fast.

329
00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:47.250
-Okay. but just not <i>so</i> fast.

330
00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.333
Medium fast. Good. good. I can do that.

331
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.541
Woo-hoo!

332
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.250
Wanna see why I'm called Soda?
Wanna see. wanna see?

333
00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:56.625
-Nope. Not real--

334
00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:05.958
-Did you see it? Did you?

335
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:07.875
Yeah. yeah. I saw.

336
00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:11.375
I taught myself how to do that.

337
00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:14.833
-Great. Soda. 
-I made the whole thing up all by myself.

338
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.250
-Wow.
-It's something. isn't it?

339
00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:27.083
I love dusk.

340
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:31.083
One night. I wanna swim
all the way to the stars.

341
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.666
Elmer! Elmer! Elmer!

342
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.750
Are you awake?

343
00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:45.166
You're awake. right? You snore.

344
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.416
Did you know that?

345
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.541
Or maybe that was your tummy.
Does it talk when it's hungry?

346
00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:52.916
Hungry? Want something orangey?
'Cause it's almost morning. you know?

347
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.333
We're in the middle of a sea.
Where are we gonna get--

348
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.041
A tangerine?

349
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:01.625
Ta-da!

350
00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:03.250
Whoa!

351
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.625
This is Tangerina.

352
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:07.291
Pretty spectacular. right?

353
00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.208
-Yeah.

354
00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:12.000
Best tangerines in town.

355
00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:14.125
Or. I mean. on the water.

356
00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:17.208
Best tangerines you'll ever taste.
That's for sure.

357
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.375
Last stop till the island. so stock up.

358
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:32.083
-Hmm! This is so good!
-Right?

359
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:38.083
How about that? That's a train.

360
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:51.750
Look! Elmer! Elmer. I made a nose!

361
00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:55.083
Look! It's just like yours!
Look quickly before it pops!

362
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:57.250
Not bad. Not bad.

363
00:22:57.333 --> 00:23:00.958
Thanks!
Taught myself that one. No big deal.

364
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:08.041
Wow!

365
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:10.416
-That must be it.
-Yep.

366
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.833
That's Wild Island.

367
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:16.791
Did you say <i>Wild</i> Island?

368
00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:19.458
Yeah. 'cause of the wild animals.

369
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.875
Wild animals?

370
00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:25.541
Yes. They have really big poky teeth
and poky claws.

371
00:23:25.625 --> 00:23:26.458
What?

372
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:27.583
-Yep.
-Wait.

373
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:29.250
They captured the dragon.

374
00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:31.958
so it can lift up the island
over and over again.

375
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:34.833
-Why would anyone do that?
-'Cause it's sinking.

376
00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:38.750
-So this is a rescue?
-Didn't the cat tell you any of this?

377
00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:40.375
No!

378
00:23:40.458 --> 00:23:42.666
Well. surprise!

379
00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:44.583
I'm dead.

380
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:19.291
-Bon voyage!

381
00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:14.666
Don't worry. dragon.
I'm here to r--

382
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.750
Okay. okay.

383
00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:43.083
Oh my--

384
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.041
Okay. okay.

385
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.291
Let go of him!

386
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:10.541
Hey. stop! I said knock it off!

387
00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:13.250
I can hardly hear Saiwa
with all your racket.

388
00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:17.166
Saiwa has made
the dragon save us once again.

389
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.166
and this is how you show gratitude?

390
00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:24.500
Quiet down now.
There is no need to be afraid.

391
00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:27.958
I brought this dragon to us.

392
00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:30.458
and as long as he lifts us up.

393
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:33.041
we will never be lost to the sea.

394
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:39.625
Hey!

395
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.291
Hush. Be calm. be calm.

396
00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:49.916
I have the answers.
I will save Wild Island.

397
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.458
I can't take it.

398
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:54.625
Saiwa's dragon is barely able
to lift the island now.

399
00:27:54.708 --> 00:27:56.458
Listen to him. Just listen.

400
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.166
Each time. we lose more ground.
I lost my home this time.

401
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.416
The most important thing
is that we all keep calm.

402
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.041
I could have drowned!
You could drown next!

403
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:08.583
And you. and you. and you--

404
00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:10.166
-Hey!

405
00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:13.458
Shut up. Tamir!

406
00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:14.375
Kwan?

407
00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:16.208
Yes. Saiwa?

408
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:17.666
Give him to me.

409
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.416
-Shush!

410
00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:24.875
Stop it. Stop it!

411
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:27.833
I don't wanna drown.
I don't wanna drown.

412
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:30.416
-Tamir. Tamir. Tamir!

413
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.166
Listen to me. You are scaring everyone.

414
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.375
I'm sorry. Saiwa.
I… I just don't wanna drown.

415
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:39.083
I don't wanna drown!
I don't wanna drown! I--

416
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:42.000
-Be calm. You are all safe.

417
00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:44.000
Be quiet!

418
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:46.708
Let Saiwa speak.

419
00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:52.083
If we surrender to panic.
I cannot save you.

420
00:28:53.083 --> 00:28:54.208
No one can.

421
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.166
Please. I simply ask you to trust me.

422
00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:02.916
The dragon--

423
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.208
The dragon does what I make him do.

424
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:08.500
and so should you
when I tell you to stop--

425
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:10.166
-But. but--
-But what?

426
00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:18.916
Mom!

427
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.208
Stop him. Kwan!

428
00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.083
Oh God--

429
00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.791
Let go! Let go!

430
00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:35.458
Kwan!

431
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:38.375
Bring him down. We can't lose the dragon.

432
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:50.541
Bring the Howlers.
We will track him and the child.

433
00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:55.708
This is not the time for panic.
We will recapture our dragon.

434
00:29:55.791 --> 00:29:56.708
But he'll hide.

435
00:29:56.791 --> 00:29:58.833
No. They can't hide from me.

436
00:29:58.916 --> 00:29:59.875
Huh.

437
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.583
Whoa!

438
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.125
Yeah!

439
00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:48.666
I… I did it!

440
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.166
I actually saved an amazing.
spectacular. real live. fire-breathing…

441
00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:58.041
…dragon?

442
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.291
Oh. ah. ooh. ooh. Ooh. ooh. ow. Ow. Ow.

443
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:03.625
I… I mean you no harm. dragon.

444
00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:07.958
-Huh?

445
00:31:08.041 --> 00:31:10.166
-Oh!

446
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.625
-Ow.

447
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:16.083
I think I hurt myself.

448
00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.791
Oh. you rescued me!

449
00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:22.291
-Ooh!
-It's my lucky day.

450
00:31:22.375 --> 00:31:26.125
I'm so lucky I could explode!
Hold… hold still so I can thank you.

451
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:33.125
-What's the matter? You not a hugger?

452
00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:35.625
Too cool for a public display
of affection?

453
00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:37.541
Yeah. me too.

454
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:41.666
-Are you for real?

455
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.583
Of course I'm real.
If I was made up. could I do this?

456
00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.458
No.

457
00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:54.000
What do you think?

458
00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:57.458
-This is not good.
-It's a work in progress.

459
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.625
Okay. Yeah. I… I can make this work.

460
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.291
All right.

461
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:12.125
Dragon. I rescued you.
so you owe me something in return.

462
00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:13.041
Right?

463
00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:16.125
I would lay down my life for you.

464
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:18.416
No. you don't have to do--

465
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.416
-Ooh.
-I would dry up oceans with fire

466
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.041
and destroy mountains
with my roar for you.

467
00:32:23.125 --> 00:32:27.458
That's oka-- Wait. you can do that?

468
00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:29.291
No.

469
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:30.625
Not at all. really.

470
00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:34.541
I get dizzy around large bodies of water.
and I'm afraid of fire.

471
00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:39.000
It can really hurt. Ow. Ow.

472
00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:42.625
This is what hurts right now. Ow.
How many wings am I holding up?

473
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:46.750
One. but the other wing looks
kinda floppy.

474
00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:50.250
This is the thanks I get
for lifting the island over and over?

475
00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:51.750
I told them it doesn't work.

476
00:32:51.833 --> 00:32:54.083
Because if it did.
I'd already be an After Dragon.

477
00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.041
-What?
-An After Dragon.

478
00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.291
It's only the best thing… ever.

479
00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.208
-Here. come with me.
-No. no!

480
00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:09.291
Ow. Ooh. Ooh. That hurt even more.

481
00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:11.041
Boy. where are you?

482
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.000
-Oh gosh.

483
00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:17.125
-Sorry. sorry. sorry.
-Why did you--

484
00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:20.833
I was trying to fly.
but my wing. it's just not working.

485
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.500
Great. This is great.

486
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.166
I'm stuck on an island full
of wild animals with poky teeth.

487
00:33:28.833 --> 00:33:31.375
I just saved a dragon who can't fly?

488
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:32.458
Uh-huh.

489
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:34.458
-Who's afraid of water?
-Uh-huh.

490
00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:36.041
Has a fear of fire?

491
00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:37.708
Uh-huh.

492
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:39.750
But dragons breathe fire.

493
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:40.958
Not me.

494
00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:42.708
Can you do anything?

495
00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:45.875
I can do this.

496
00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:48.541
Hold on. Hold on.

497
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:51.000
Wait. I'm usually
a lot sweatier than this.

498
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:52.500
-Okay. stop.

499
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:57.625
-Did you just--
-That was… my armpit.

500
00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:01.458
Look over here.
It's that thing I wanted to show you.

501
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:04.333
That's what I'll look like
after I get my fire.

502
00:34:04.416 --> 00:34:06.291
When I save the island.

503
00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:08.916
See?

504
00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:10.750
Not really.

505
00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:14.875
Well. dragons have been coming
to Wild Island for thousands of years.

506
00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:19.625
Because when we turn 100.
which is only 100 divided by

507
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.916
ten in human boy years. which is…

508
00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:24.916
which is…

509
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.583
Uh…

510
00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:27.666
Ten. It's ten!

511
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.416
Ten! I said it at the same time.
When we're ten years old.

512
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.250
we come here to Wild Island
to do a rite of passage.

513
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:37.333
like bees to a flower.
except for dragons. not bees.

514
00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.416
And it's an island. not a flower.

515
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.750
We have to save Wild Island from sinking
'cause it sinks every 100 years.

516
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:48.583
If we can do that. we become After Dragons

517
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:54.333
who breathe fire and have muscles
and who are smart and brave like this.

518
00:34:57.208 --> 00:35:01.291
I'm pretty sure I'll look just like that
after I save the island and get my fire.

519
00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:04.416
Wait. You already saved the island.
I saw you do it.

520
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.291
No. That's the way Saiwa made me do it.

521
00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:09.000
But it can't be right
because it just sinks worse the next time.

522
00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:12.166
And it's scary and fiery and bad up there.

523
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.333
So how are you supposed to do it?

524
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:16.500
I have… no idea.

525
00:35:16.583 --> 00:35:18.750
-I'm just not an answer guy.

526
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:21.166
-It doesn't mean there isn't one.
-Nope.

527
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.041
-There must be a way to figure it out.
-None. Except for Aratuah.

528
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:28.125
-Who's that?
-He's a really old tortoise.

529
00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:31.583
He was here when Horatio saved the island.
so he knows all about dragons.

530
00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:33.166
He drew this muscly After Dragon.

531
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.583
-All right. Let's go ask him.
-Except I don't know where he is.

532
00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:38.541
Aw. come on!

533
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:41.083
When I landed on the island.
I looked for him.

534
00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:44.958
and looked and looked
and looked and looked.

535
00:35:45.583 --> 00:35:48.708
I thought maybe Aratuah would leave me
a sign or some kind of map

536
00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:50.458
or something. right?

537
00:35:50.541 --> 00:35:53.125
-Why are you making that face?
-I'll help you.

538
00:35:53.208 --> 00:35:54.875
You'd do that for me?

539
00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:56.541
-Yes.

540
00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.750
But after I help you become
an After Dragon. you'll help me.

541
00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:01.166
Of course.

542
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.833
We'll come back to Nevergreen
and be in my dragon show.

543
00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:07.375
Except that after my rite of passage.
I'm supposed to go home.

544
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:08.833
It's gonna be awesome.

545
00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:13.791
All my family will fly up to see me.
and I'll blow fire. and they'll all cheer.

546
00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:18.875
Okay. Well. I did rescue you.
and it doesn't have to be forever.

547
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.708
I just need you to help me
earn enough money for my store.

548
00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:24.500
-Do we have a deal?
-Okay. Sounds good.

549
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.250
Uh. okay.

550
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:32.875
I'm gonna call you… Answer Guy.

551
00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:34.958
-Elmer. My name is Elmer.

552
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:37.541
Of course you have a cool name like that.

553
00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:42.166
My name's Boris. Not as cool.
but it goes with my face.

554
00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:43.875
I lied to you. Elmer.

555
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:46.583
-That fart didn't come from my armpit.
-I don't wanna know.

556
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.666
They're on foot.

557
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.375
The dragon's wing must be badly wounded.

558
00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:12.333
Badly wounded?

559
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:15.875
Oh no!

560
00:37:15.958 --> 00:37:19.666
It's a catastrophe!
We're gonna-- No. no!

561
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.625
Saiwa. how can you stand
that runt in your ear?

562
00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:24.625
-Cut him loose.
-Who you calling a runt?

563
00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:27.833
I won't cut him loose.
He'll cause panic. You know that. Kwan.

564
00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:31.416
What if we're squandering our chance
to leave a doomed island?

565
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.958
Now. now. 

566
00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:35.791
Saiwa!

567
00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:37.500
He's close.

568
00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:44.041
My brother Horatio
taught me to spit really far.

569
00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:47.416
and I bet I could hit that tree.
Do you wanna see? Elmer?

570
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.208
-Uh. can you keep an eye out for arrows?
-Okay.

571
00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:54.791
I'm actually really hungry right now.
Skunk cabbage is my favorite.

572
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:57.958
You don't suppose there are any
around here? There's an arrow!

573
00:37:58.041 --> 00:38:00.791
Nope. Nope. There's an arrow!
No. no. no. sorry. False alarm.

574
00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:02.000
Hey. you know what?

575
00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:04.541
-I'll be the arrow finder. okay?
-Sure.

576
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:07.250
Just be quiet so I can concentrate.

577
00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:13.708
Oh my gosh.

578
00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:18.750
It's a whole little world of strawberry!

579
00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:24.791
Do not touch the stuff
in my backpack. Got it?

580
00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:26.125
-Really?
-I mean it.

581
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.041
-Okay.

582
00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:29.958
Why?

583
00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.083
-'Cause I need everything in here.
-Why?

584
00:38:32.166 --> 00:38:34.458
-'Cause I do.
-So it's very important?

585
00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:36.958
-Yes!
-More important than that arrow?

586
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.333
Oh!

587
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.791
Okay. Great. This way.

588
00:38:42.875 --> 00:38:45.750
Yeah! Aratuah. here we come.

589
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.916
-Huh?

590
00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:54.583
What was that?

591
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.000
-Uh. Saiwa's coming after us!
-Coming after us?

592
00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:02.375
He's coming after us!

593
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.750
We can get across here.

594
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.125
Uh…

595
00:39:08.791 --> 00:39:09.708
Elmer?

596
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:13.291
Remember when I said…
that water makes me dizzy?

597
00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:17.333
Come on. Boris. I don't wanna
get eaten by anyone with poky claws

598
00:39:18.458 --> 00:39:20.625
-or poky… teeth!

599
00:39:25.958 --> 00:39:28.916
-Crocodiles!
-And water. Don't forget the water.

600
00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:35.250
And Saiwa's coming! I can't go back.

601
00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:39.333
It's so scary up there at the summit.
All the fire. It'll burn me up!

602
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:41.416
They won't get you. I'll make sure of it.

603
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.000
Wow. I like that answer.
Nothing's gonna stop us.

604
00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:48.708
Except maybe him!

605
00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:58.583
What do you think you're doing. dragon?

606
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.500
Douglas. Winifred.
you get back here right now.

607
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:11.333
Children! It's not safe.
you naughty little reptiles.

608
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:15.541
Ease up. will you?

609
00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:18.291
You're squeezing the life out of me.

610
00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:21.458
This is all your fault. dragon.

611
00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:24.958
What do you think you're doing.
swanning about down here?

612
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.083
This isn't exactly swanning!

613
00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:29.458
-What in the world is this thing?

614
00:40:29.541 --> 00:40:30.583
That's an Elmer.

615
00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:34.333
He's the answer guy.
He's gonna help me save the island.

616
00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:35.958
Quickly. this way!

617
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:38.833
You? Save Wild Island?

618
00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:42.041
You're pulling my leg.

619
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:44.916
-Hey! Stop pulling my leg!

620
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.916
Hurry. Boris.
We gotta… climb to the other side!

621
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.625
Now. where was I?

622
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.916
I'll snap you in two.

623
00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:55.375
Come on. Boris!

624
00:40:55.458 --> 00:40:57.541
This is so hard.

625
00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:01.333
-Elmer!

626
00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:06.375
-You dragon thief!

627
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:08.750
You have the wrong end
of the stick. crocodile!

628
00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.458
My name is Cornelius. And I agree!

629
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.583
No!

630
00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:25.583
What's happening?

631
00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:27.833
Oh no. Come on. wee ones.

632
00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:30.041
Quick. Here you go.
Come on. Let's go.

633
00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:38.750
Elmer! Elmer!

634
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:41.000
-Hurry. Boris!
-Have you got a better answer?

635
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:43.083
This one's not working so well for me.

636
00:41:45.708 --> 00:41:47.291
And Saiwa's coming.

637
00:41:49.291 --> 00:41:51.125
-Don't make me go back!
-Come on. Boris!

638
00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.541
Oh. no. I can't.

639
00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:54.666
Saiwa. your dragon is here.

640
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:55.875
He's here!

641
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:57.375
Elmer!

642
00:41:57.458 --> 00:41:59.541
-Look. Boris! It's all yours.

643
00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:00.583
Strawberry.

644
00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:02.416
Strawberry?

645
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.458
Come and get it.

646
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:06.791
Strawberry is almost as tasty
as skunk cabbage.

647
00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:09.708
-Get him!
-Look at me. Boris.

648
00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:12.583
Boris. look at me.
You just gotta keep on going.

649
00:42:12.666 --> 00:42:13.791
We're almost there.

650
00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:16.541
-Elmer!
-Come on!

651
00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:29.375
Boris!

652
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:33.625
Uh. oh.

653
00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:35.833
Grab onto the lollipop.

654
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.708
Oh! Whoa! Help!

655
00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:43.583
Whoa!

656
00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:48.333
I've got you.

657
00:42:58.333 --> 00:42:59.416
-Saiwa!

658
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.750
-Kwan!

659
00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:09.000
-I can't hold them.
-But I have him.

660
00:43:16.666 --> 00:43:18.083
Children! Help!

661
00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:19.833
Kwan. you must save them.

662
00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:21.291
Kwan!

663
00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:23.750
Kwa--

664
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.416
-Kwan!

665
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:53.125
It stopped.

666
00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:56.166
For now. but… it'll happen again

667
00:43:56.666 --> 00:43:59.291
and again and again.

668
00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:00.833
Let's keep moving. then.

669
00:44:00.916 --> 00:44:03.291
Got any more
of those strawberry things?

670
00:44:03.375 --> 00:44:06.416
No. And paws off the backpack. Okay?

671
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.875
Well… I'm pretty sure I could go faster
if you showed me what's in there.

672
00:44:10.958 --> 00:44:11.833
No.

673
00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:13.083
Aw. come on.

674
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:17.666
Hey.

675
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:18.750
Boris. stop!

676
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.375
Really? Why?

677
00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:25.375
Look. I don't have time to explain.
The island is sinking. Remember?

678
00:44:26.333 --> 00:44:27.250
Okay.

679
00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:28.916
Let's go.

680
00:44:39.458 --> 00:44:46.250
Oh. Douglas. Winifred. I was so worried.
Where's George? George!

681
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.333
Am I alive? Am I alive?

682
00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:53.208
Alive. Most definitely alive.

683
00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:55.541
-Hey! Cut it out! Stop it!

684
00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:58.375
Oh. children. there you are.

685
00:44:58.458 --> 00:45:00.416
Oh. thank you. Kwan.

686
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.541
-Saiwa? Saiwa!

687
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.833
-It's sinking faster now.
-Oh. oh. now he's worried.

688
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.000
Oh. not now. Kwan. Not now.

689
00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:13.750
But I had the dragon. I had him.
Why did you make me turn back?

690
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:15.250
Listen. Listen to me.

691
00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:19.375
The whole island will be gone
if we don't recapture that dragon!

692
00:45:20.666 --> 00:45:21.916
They all look to me.

693
00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:25.583
Do you understand? To me.

694
00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:30.250
Someday. they will look to you.

695
00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:34.000
-And you must not abandon them.
-But our home will be gone.

696
00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:37.041
We still have time to capture our dragon.

697
00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:38.708
Trust me.

698
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.708
-Hey. buddy. what do you think?
-About what?

699
00:45:57.791 --> 00:46:00.291
It's… um. nice?

700
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:02.833
Great! That could be
our secret friendship whistle.

701
00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:07.333
-You know. 'cause we're friends now.
-I'm not really a whistler.

702
00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:10.583
Are you kidding me?
What if you meet another wild animal.

703
00:46:10.666 --> 00:46:13.958
or I hurt my other wing
or see a Howler or Kwan or Saiwa?

704
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:18.166
-How are we supposed to call each other?
-By saying "help"?

705
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.291
Oh. come on! Anyone can do that.

706
00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:22.958
You don't even have to be
friends or anything.

707
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:35.791
-Not funny!

708
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:38.666
Are you scared?

709
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.041
No! I am cautious. There is a difference.

710
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.458
-Where did you get that scarf?
-It's so soft.

711
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:51.166
It feels really good against my skin.
Go on. Give it a feel.

712
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:53.458
Boris.

713
00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:58.375
It's not really a soft scarf. is it?

714
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:00.291
Uh…

715
00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:05.500
-George. look who it is!

716
00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:06.916
No.

717
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
No way. You're messing with me.

718
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.375
Elmer? I'm feeling really cautious.

719
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.708
I'm going to be a hero!

720
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:22.666
-I captured Saiwa's dragon for him.

721
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.666
Well. <i>we</i> captured him.

722
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.791
-What's this thing?

723
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:30.666
It looks sweet and chewy.

724
00:47:31.166 --> 00:47:33.250
Sasha. give it here.
I'll take the first bite.

725
00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:35.916
And I'll take the dragon to Saiwa.

726
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:38.750
-Hey! No. you don't. I'll take it.

727
00:47:43.625 --> 00:47:47.208
You look just like a sweet. juicy melon

728
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:50.250
with bits of hair stuck to you.

729
00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:56.083
Stop it. Sasha.

730
00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:00.208
-Sasha.

731
00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:01.416
Elmer!

732
00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:03.750
Help!

733
00:48:04.416 --> 00:48:05.250
He's mine!

734
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:07.625
No! That sweet little morsel is mine!

735
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.375
Wait! I have something sweet!

736
00:48:11.458 --> 00:48:12.708
Obviously.

737
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.125
No. no. much sweeter.
Cinnamon-flavored bubble gum!

738
00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:22.375
Every chew releases a whole new burst
of mouthwatering sweetness!

739
00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:24.958
You've not tasted anything like it before.

740
00:48:25.041 --> 00:48:28.916
and it will be the… the highlight
of your entire existence.

741
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.958
It comes from a little town far away.
and… it tastes like home.

742
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:34.000
-Oooh.
-Yum.

743
00:48:34.083 --> 00:48:36.458
-Oh. yes. Give me! Give it!
-I want some!

744
00:48:36.541 --> 00:48:37.416
-Mine!
-Mine!

745
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.583
Mine!

746
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:41.666
I've only got one.
so you're gonna have to fight for it!

747
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:49.625
Elmer?

748
00:48:49.708 --> 00:48:51.000
Boris!

749
00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:07.708
Sinking. sinking.

750
00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:10.625
Every morning.
every night. sinking. sinking!

751
00:49:10.708 --> 00:49:12.875
-Sinking.

752
00:49:24.125 --> 00:49:25.208
What is it. Boris?

753
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:27.666
I'm calling you.

754
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.750
-Yes. I get it. but what do you want?
-Okay. good.

755
00:49:30.833 --> 00:49:33.625
I gotta stop and catch my breath.

756
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:36.916
-Not a good idea.
-I'm a better flier… than a walker.

757
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.708
The sooner we find Aratuah.
the sooner we get out of here.

758
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:42.833
What?

759
00:49:42.916 --> 00:49:46.375
You know. you said no more stuff
from the backpack.

760
00:49:46.458 --> 00:49:49.166
but you gave those tigers
that cinnamon-flavored bubble gum.

761
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:53.083
so is the new rule "no stuff from
the backpack unless we're gonna die?"

762
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:56.750
Sounds like you got your breath back.
so let's go.

763
00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:59.291
Okay. Is Neverblue your home?

764
00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:02.250
Nevergreen.
It's called Nevergreen.

765
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.458
It's just a place where I live.
but it's not my home.

766
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
I used to have a store with my mom.

767
00:50:08.083 --> 00:50:10.791
-So that's your home. then?
-Uh. no. not anymore.

768
00:50:10.875 --> 00:50:13.375
-Then where's your home?
-I don't have one right now.

769
00:50:13.458 --> 00:50:16.041
But I will when I set up the store.

770
00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:18.041
-That you had.
-No. A new one.

771
00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:20.583
Oh. so this store's gonna
be different 'cause it's new?

772
00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:22.750
No. it's… it's gonna be the…

773
00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:24.041
…same!

774
00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:27.500
Elmer!

775
00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:30.250
Elmer. are you okay?

776
00:50:30.333 --> 00:50:34.333
Yeah. I'm… I'm fine.
Just be careful where you stand.

777
00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.125
Somebody set this trap.

778
00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:37.166
What?

779
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:42.416
Oh my gosh.

780
00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:45.500
Elmer. you've gotta see this.

781
00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:49.000
There are so many
cute little furry mouse things.

782
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:50.750
Hello!

783
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:54.916
What? Oh. I get it.

784
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.958
Yeah. it's a trap for me.

785
00:50:59.041 --> 00:51:02.416
-You gotta get me out of here!
-Don't worry. I know what to do.

786
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.958
Throw me your backpack. sweater.
shirt. pants. Everything.

787
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:09.166
Good idea.
We can tie a rope out of my clothes.

788
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.833
Oh. Yeah. That's probably better.

789
00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:15.000
-Wait. what was your plan?
-Doesn't matter. We can try it your way.

790
00:51:20.958 --> 00:51:22.125
Something's down here!

791
00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:25.125
Boris.

792
00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:27.208
Here's a stick. Grab on.

793
00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:31.333
-I can't reach it. Boris! I gotta get out!
-Okay.

794
00:51:34.916 --> 00:51:38.041
-Boris. you gotta help!
-Just a second!

795
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:42.708
-Boris?

796
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.291
Elmer! Elmer?

797
00:52:03.875 --> 00:52:04.791
Elmer!

798
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.291
Elmer!

799
00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:13.458
-Answer me!
-Don't come down. Boris.

800
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:17.166
It's… useless. It's useless.

801
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.416
-You're just scared.

802
00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:22.833
-Don't worry. It's going to be okay.

803
00:52:22.916 --> 00:52:24.791
Get real.

804
00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:29.000
We are in a hole on a sinking island.

805
00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:32.708
It's not gonna be okay.

806
00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:38.416
I know you're hungry.

807
00:52:38.916 --> 00:52:41.791
I'll get you something. I promise.

808
00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:46.083
Does… he like tangerines?

809
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:47.666
You got tangerines?

810
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.250
-My baby loves tangerines.

811
00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:52.625
-Here you go.

812
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.583
-My name's Iris.
-I'm Elmer.

813
00:52:56.166 --> 00:52:58.583
You're the boy who took Saiwa's dragon.

814
00:52:58.666 --> 00:53:03.541
They made this trap for you.
but I fell in with my baby.

815
00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:04.583
I… I'm sorry.

816
00:53:04.666 --> 00:53:08.291
Why did you do it?
Why did you take the dragon?

817
00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:11.916
-He needed to be rescued.
-But who's gonna rescue us?

818
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.041
Saiwa. he had a way of keeping us safe.

819
00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:18.666
If that was true. the island would've been
safe for a hundred years.

820
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.750
and Boris would be an After Dragon.
Don't you see?

821
00:53:22.875 --> 00:53:25.958
-I just want it to be okay again.

822
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:27.458
It will be.

823
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:31.250
I'm taking Boris to Aratuah
to find the real answer.

824
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.125
And we'll be safe then?

825
00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:35.000
I'm sure of it.

826
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:38.041
Well. that would be such a relief.

827
00:53:38.125 --> 00:53:41.291
if we weren't trapped
in a hole with no way out.

828
00:53:41.375 --> 00:53:43.625
-Boris is up there. He can help--

829
00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:49.041
Get away from him!

830
00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:52.583
Whoa. a baby! Ha. you little coochie coo.

831
00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:56.500
-Boris! You jumped in.
-Of course. I had to help my friend.

832
00:53:56.583 --> 00:53:59.791
-But… how are we gonna get out?

833
00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:17.416
Hey. hey! Stop fighting!

834
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.958
Stop! Let go!
Saiwa. there's something down here.

835
00:54:23.958 --> 00:54:25.083
Calm down. Tamir.

836
00:54:25.166 --> 00:54:28.416
-Saiwa says calm down! Calm down!
-Everybody. shut up!

837
00:54:29.416 --> 00:54:32.125
Dragon… you can come out.

838
00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:36.541
You won't be harmed.

839
00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:38.666
I promise.

840
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.625
-It's only me. Saiwa. Me and my baby.

841
00:54:48.708 --> 00:54:49.833
Iris?

842
00:54:49.916 --> 00:54:51.458
-Come on. Saiwa.
-Wait. Kwan.

843
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:53.583
-Let's keep moving.
-We have to get them out.

844
00:54:55.958 --> 00:54:57.708
Can't you stop them fighting?

845
00:54:57.791 --> 00:54:59.458
Hush. Hush now.

846
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:01.500
Hold on. Iris. We'll get you out.

847
00:55:08.916 --> 00:55:10.416
Wait. wait. wait!

848
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.166
-What is it?
-I… I heard them. Saiwa.

849
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:14.750
The dragon and the boy.

850
00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:19.166
The boy said
he was taking the dragon to the summit.

851
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.750
That doesn't make sense.
The dragon hates it there.

852
00:55:21.833 --> 00:55:25.791
The boy doesn't want to drown.
None of us do. Saiwa.

853
00:55:26.458 --> 00:55:28.750
If anyone can help him now. it's you.

854
00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:30.625
-Just you.

855
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:33.708
-Let's go to the summit!
-We have to get her out first.

856
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:36.541
We could sink at any second.
We don't have time.

857
00:55:36.625 --> 00:55:37.833
Kwan!

858
00:55:37.916 --> 00:55:39.541
No. it's okay.

859
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:41.875
See?

860
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.625
We'll be all right. Iris.

861
00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.833
-Howlers. come.

862
00:55:57.583 --> 00:55:58.416
They're gone.

863
00:55:58.916 --> 00:56:00.500
That was very brave.

864
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.916
Thank you. Iris.

865
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.958
Elmer. Saiwa has forbidden
all the animals from going there…

866
00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:10.500
…but I know where Aratuah is.

867
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.583
<i>I hope you find the answer.</i>
<i>for all our sakes.</i>

868
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:20.041
<i>You're on your own from here.</i>

869
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.750
Uh…

870
00:56:25.833 --> 00:56:27.458
Don't worry. I'll go first.

871
00:56:27.541 --> 00:56:28.958
Okay. Sure.

872
00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:32.916
Are you all right. Boris?

873
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.958
Yeah. It's just I'm nervous.
anxious. scared.

874
00:56:37.041 --> 00:56:39.166
and I got that dizzy thing going on.

875
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.083
-Sorry.

876
00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:48.875
That must be him.

877
00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:57.375
-I'm gonna faint.
-Breathe. Just don't forget to breathe.

878
00:57:06.541 --> 00:57:10.083
Uh. can you ask him?
Just ask him for me. will ya?

879
00:57:12.458 --> 00:57:14.541
Okay.

880
00:57:16.916 --> 00:57:18.208
Ancient Aratuah?

881
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:21.041
We've come to ask you.

882
00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:24.791
how is a dragon supposed
to save Wild Island?

883
00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:28.750
-And fix my wing.
-And fix… Boris's wing?

884
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:32.166
If… that's something that you do.

885
00:57:35.708 --> 00:57:39.666
Uh. Boris is the dragon
who has come to save the island.

886
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.083
Ask about my fire.

887
00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:45.041
Can you… tell the dragon Boris
how to get his fire?

888
00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:48.458
Even if it's like a… a riddle or a--

889
00:57:48.541 --> 00:57:50.250
-Puzzle?
-No. Uh…

890
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:53.958
Like… like a task we need
to do first or… or something.

891
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:57.000
It's just… that we don't have much time.

892
00:57:59.916 --> 00:58:01.708
Uh. Aratuah?

893
00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:04.791
Ancient Aratuah?

894
00:58:04.875 --> 00:58:06.000
What if that's his…

895
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.208
Oh.

896
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:11.750
Yeah. Right.

897
00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:15.583
-It was his butt.
-Shh.

898
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:18.000
-Aratuah?

899
00:58:20.833 --> 00:58:22.833
-You know what? You try.
-What? No.

900
00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:24.500
-Just tell him.
-I can't.

901
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:27.666
-Elmer!
-Just do it. Just go!

902
00:58:29.375 --> 00:58:30.208
Uh…

903
00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:37.958
Is that supposed to happen?

904
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:39.583
Wait a second. Boris.

905
00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:42.875
Elmer? Aratuah?

906
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:45.416
We've been looking for so long.

907
00:58:46.375 --> 00:58:47.250
Aratuah!

908
00:58:50.083 --> 00:58:53.041
What did he say? Elmer. what did he say?
Can I see? Can I see him?

909
00:58:53.125 --> 00:58:55.833
-No. Don't go in there. No.
-Come on. let me see.

910
00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:57.958
-I wanna-- Aratuah!
-Stop. Don't go in there.

911
00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:00.500
Sorry about cracking your shell.
It was an accident.

912
00:59:00.583 --> 00:59:01.541
-No! Stop!
-Aratuah!

913
00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:02.458
He's dead!

914
00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:07.958
He's dead?

915
00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:13.291
What do I do now. Elmer?

916
00:59:14.583 --> 00:59:17.958
I… I… I--

917
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:21.166
Come on. Boris.

918
00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:22.791
We gotta go!

919
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.375
Boris? Are you okay?

920
00:59:53.166 --> 00:59:55.458
I just need to lie down someplace warm.

921
00:59:56.916 --> 00:59:58.125
I'll look after you.

922
00:59:58.208 --> 00:59:59.166
Elmer?

923
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.583
You spoke to Aratuah?
You know how to save us?

924
01:00:04.541 --> 01:00:05.708
We… we did.

925
01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:08.333
-Oh. that's wonderful!

926
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:12.875
Yeah. but before he can do
his rite of passage.

927
01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:15.375
Boris just-- He needs to rest. you know?

928
01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:18.333
Oh. of course. Of course.
I know just the place.

929
01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:40.958
Right at the top is safe and dry.

930
01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.375
-You can rest there.
-Thank you. Iris.

931
01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:48.750
No. no. no. Thank you… so much.

932
01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:00.208
You must be hungry.

933
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.083
You said it's not for sharing.

934
01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:17.083
Forget what I said.

935
01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.500
Just… help yourself.

936
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.166
That's what I used
to free you from the vines.

937
01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.875
That helped me see Iris in the pit.

938
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.833
Do you like… tangerines. Boris?

939
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:45.583
Tangerines?

940
01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:56.458
No. no. that's for you.

941
01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:02.958
You eat just the peel
and not the fleshy part?

942
01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.666
Of course not.

943
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:08.125
Then this is gonna work out just fine.

944
01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:12.375
I forgot how good they taste.

945
01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:19.666
My brother Horatio brought me
tangerines home

946
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.875
when he became an After Dragon.

947
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:26.041
I could hear his whistle…
in the sky over Blueland.

948
01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:28.416
Everyone was so proud.

949
01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:32.125
No one's ever going to be proud of me.

950
01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:39.375
-Can I tell you a secret?
-Yeah.

951
01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:43.791
I'm kind of relieved that I'm not expected
to do anything now

952
01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:47.291
because the truth is
I couldn't do it anyway.

953
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:52.625
That's what I really feel
in the pit of my stomach.

954
01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:56.041
I bet you'd be
a great After Dragon. Boris.

955
01:02:56.125 --> 01:03:01.541
You always know what to do. Elmer.
You don't seem to be scared of anything.

956
01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.041
Well. I--

957
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.083
I don't know what I'd do without you.

958
01:03:05.166 --> 01:03:08.916
I'd be burned up at the summit
or drowned in the sea.

959
01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:12.791
You're right. I'm not scared of anything.

960
01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.250
Just rest.

961
01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.666
When you wake up. I'll have the answer.

962
01:03:19.416 --> 01:03:21.250
This really was my lucky day.

963
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.458
And tomorrow's gonna be even luckier.

964
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:41.375
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Elmer.</i>

965
01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:45.000
<i>I'm sorry. Elmer. I'm sorry.</i>

966
01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:50.750
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

967
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:54.458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Elmer.

968
01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:55.375
Mom?

969
01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:57.916
I'm so sorry. Elmer.

970
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.333
-For what?
-He made me tell him where you were.

971
01:05:01.416 --> 01:05:03.208
-I had to protect my baby.

972
01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:04.625
So it's true.

973
01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:06.625
-Boris!
-I'm up.

974
01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:08.375
-Boris. get up!
-I'm up!

975
01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:11.625
Look at all the trouble
you have caused us.

976
01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.791
you worthless thing!

977
01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:16.000
Stay away from us. Kwan.

978
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:19.041
-Boris. stop!
-You're coming with me!

979
01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:20.291
Tell him. Boris.

980
01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:24.291
that you spoke to Aratuah.
that you know how to save the island.

981
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.916
You spoke to Aratuah?

982
01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:30.458
He told us the real answer. not Saiwa's.

983
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.333
Then he can stop all of this.

984
01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.666
No. he cannot.

985
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:39.791
Isn't that right. dragon?

986
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.375
Elmer? Please help.

987
01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:46.708
Aratuah did not help him
because he's dead.

988
01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:48.291
-Dead?
-Dead?

989
01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:50.125
-Elmer.

990
01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:53.625
-I… I…
-How could you?

991
01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:56.291
Do you remember the day
you came here. dragon?

992
01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.625
You had no idea how to save this island.

993
01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:03.250
I helped you do
what you knew you could not.

994
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:04.500
Please. Elmer.

995
01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.541
Now all you have to do
is come with me now.

996
01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.250
-We will save the island again.
-I don't wanna go back--

997
01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.416
Together.

998
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.916
-I can't.
-Leave him alone!

999
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.375
Ok. quiet. boy!
He's our dragon. not yours.

1000
01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.208
No. Boris!

1001
01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:20.833
-Dragon!
-I don't wanna go back.

1002
01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:22.750
-No!
-Elmer!

1003
01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:29.125
-Aw!

1004
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:31.208
My wing!

1005
01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:58.208
Yeah!

1006
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.666
Whoo-hoo!

1007
01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:06.791
I told you I'm a better flier
than a walker.

1008
01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:10.500
We can go now.
I can take you back to Nevergreen.

1009
01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:13.250
Yeah.

1010
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.000
<i>I hope you find the answer.</i>

1011
01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:28.166
<i>for all our sakes.</i>

1012
01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:30.291
<i>They captured the dragon</i>

1013
01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:33.416
<i>so it could lift up</i>
<i>the island over and over again.</i>

1014
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.333
<i>Why?</i>

1015
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.250
Roots. They're dragging it down.

1016
01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:42.208
If we can lift it high enough
to snap the roots…

1017
01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.833
-What?
-…we can save the island!

1018
01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.708
-Roots?
-I have the answer!

1019
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:49.625
Because you're the answer guy!
I knew you'd come through!

1020
01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:52.125
-Yeah.
-Let's go!

1021
01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:56.166
-Is it? Look! I knew it!

1022
01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.375
Aw. hurrah.

1023
01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:59.583
-There is still hope.
-I knew it! I knew it!

1024
01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:04.083
That dragon is useless.
and so are you. Saiwa.

1025
01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:06.083
-We can recapture him.

1026
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:09.958
For what? He can't save the island!

1027
01:08:10.041 --> 01:08:13.583
And you can't either.
no matter how much you talk.

1028
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:17.083
That little runt there knew it
from the start!

1029
01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:20.625
I listened to you. I trusted you.

1030
01:08:20.708 --> 01:08:21.583
Kwan?

1031
01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:22.791
But not anymore.

1032
01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:29.041
I'm getting off of this sinking mudhole!

1033
01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:33.666
I'm gonna take care of myself.
and you can all drown together!

1034
01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:05.666
Oh my God. What… What's… happened?

1035
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:10.458
Elmer. it's like it cracked open.
What… what do we do now?

1036
01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:13.041
-I have to tie you up. okay?
-What?

1037
01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:15.875
No. no! That… that was Saiwa's idea. and--

1038
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:18.666
-Calm down. You need to listen to me.
-That can't be right.

1039
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.541
If we lift the island high enough.
it'll snap the roots.

1040
01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:24.916
No. no. no.
Look at this place. I'll mess up. I--

1041
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
No. you won't because I'm coming with you.

1042
01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:29.916
-We're gonna do it together.
-Doesn't seem right.

1043
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.208
I freed you. I can free the island.
This is the answer.

1044
01:09:36.166 --> 01:09:37.250
Do it fast.

1045
01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:45.208
Okay. Boris. Go!

1046
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.916
-Lift. lift!
-Yeah.

1047
01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:23.208
-Come on! You can do this! Lift! Lift!

1048
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.000
-You're almost there. Come on. now.

1049
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:42.000
You're doing it!
Come on. just a little more!

1050
01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:47.958
-You're doing it. Boris! You're doing it!

1051
01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:57.250
Boris? Boris. what's wrong?

1052
01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.458
Are you okay? You've gotta lift.

1053
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:01.333
-Lift!
-I have the answer.

1054
01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:06.583
Come on! Lift! Lift!

1055
01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.541
-You can't be here. Elmer.
-What?

1056
01:11:08.625 --> 01:11:11.250
-I have to let you down.
-No. no. no! Boris. please!

1057
01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:15.833
Please! Come on!

1058
01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.083
Lift! Lift!

1059
01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:37.041
-Lift! Come on. bud!

1060
01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.458
Quick. untie me.

1061
01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:12.958
Boris. we have to get out of here.

1062
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.666
-But I understand now.
-Hold still. Boris.

1063
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:19.666
We were flying and you said I could do it.
and I believed it for the first time.

1064
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:23.333
-Hold still. or I can't cut you free.
-I could feel it in the pit of my stomach.

1065
01:12:23.416 --> 01:12:25.750
We don't have time now.
The island is done for.

1066
01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:28.500
Listen. it didn't work
because you don't have the answer.

1067
01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:29.750
-Stop!
-I do.

1068
01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:32.250
-No! Just stop!
-I have to go in there.

1069
01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:45.416
I have to do it on my own.

1070
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.833
No! You know what will happen. Just stop!

1071
01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:53.375
-I can't stop!
-You'll burn up in there.

1072
01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:56.291
-You're wrong.
-Listen. I can help. Just let me help.

1073
01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:59.916
-Just stop. Boris. Stop.
-No. I've gotta go. Just let me go!

1074
01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:03.916
You'll never be an After Dragon!

1075
01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:14.166
Come on.

1076
01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:16.500
Leave me alone.

1077
01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:19.291
No! Because I have to get us out
of this mess!

1078
01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:20.875
I said leave me alone!

1079
01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:32.000
Forget you too.

1080
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:14.833
Saiwa?

1081
01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:19.583
Hey! Shh! Leave him alone.
He has to find fresh water. shelter. food.

1082
01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:22.375
you know. little stuff like that
so we don't die.

1083
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.208
I… I might have something left for you.

1084
01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:29.875
We don't need anything from you.

1085
01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:32.125
-I was trying to--

1086
01:14:35.416 --> 01:14:37.208
I… I thought I could help.

1087
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:38.583
Help?

1088
01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:42.125
I… helped.

1089
01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:47.291
When the island started sinking.
I went to Aratuah. but he was gone.

1090
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.875
I knew fear would drown us
long before the sea.

1091
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:54.583
so… I kept the truth from them.

1092
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.541
And when the dragon came.
we thought we were saved.

1093
01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:02.875
But he was foolish… and frightened.

1094
01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:06.500
Don't say that. He pulled
the island up for you over and over.

1095
01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:10.500
I used him. yes. to keep us safe.

1096
01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:12.541
-What did you use him for?

1097
01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.791
I… I didn't. I'm his friend.

1098
01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:19.000
Oh. I see.

1099
01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:21.666
He thought you were his friend.

1100
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.041
-I…

1101
01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:26.708
Foolish.

1102
01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:28.750
And frightened.

1103
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.458
Boris! Boris!

1104
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.250
Boris!

1105
01:16:32.416 --> 01:16:33.250
Boris?

1106
01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.000
I'm sorry. Boris.

1107
01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:42.000
No. You were right. I can't do it. Elmer.

1108
01:16:43.041 --> 01:16:44.791
I can't save anyone.

1109
01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:47.208
I can't do anything.

1110
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.666
I'm too scared.

1111
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:04.125
I get scared too.

1112
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.541
I get scared all the time.

1113
01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:13.000
I try to figure everything out.
but I can't.

1114
01:17:13.916 --> 01:17:14.750
You?

1115
01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:17.583
Go get your fire.

1116
01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:20.833
And I'll be here for you
when you get back.

1117
01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:28.000
Thank you.

1118
01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.458
Boris.

1119
01:20:56.291 --> 01:20:58.791
Boris.

1120
01:20:58.875 --> 01:21:00.250
Come on. Boris. please.

1121
01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:43.125
Boris?

1122
01:21:49.958 --> 01:21:50.958
Boris!

1123
01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.208
Boris. you did it!

1124
01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:01.833
Boris! Yeah!

1125
01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:05.083
-Yes!

1126
01:22:06.083 --> 01:22:07.583
Yeah!

1127
01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:12.708
-Boris! You did it. Boris!
-You should have seen it. Elmer.

1128
01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:15.750
The whole place was
like the pit of my stomach.

1129
01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:55.000
You know. these After Dragon drawings.
they're not very realistic. are they?

1130
01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:56.500
I think there's a resemblance.

1131
01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:57.416
Yeah?

1132
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.250
I'm an After Dragon.

1133
01:22:59.333 --> 01:23:02.208
-Boris? Elmer?

1134
01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:05.208
We just wanted to say thank you.

1135
01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:07.041
Thank you. Boris.

1136
01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:09.291
Thank you. Boris.

1137
01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:23.500
-I believe this is yours.

1138
01:23:23.583 --> 01:23:24.666
Aw.

1139
01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:28.708
-Look! It's Saiwa.

1140
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:36.291
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1141
01:23:37.208 --> 01:23:38.958
I thought I had the answer.

1142
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:41.791
I had nothing.

1143
01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:45.291
I am sorry.

1144
01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:50.708
You know what Wild Island needs now?

1145
01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:52.250
It needs you.

1146
01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:55.958
all of you. to tell my story.

1147
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:57.875
Draw it up here

1148
01:23:58.458 --> 01:23:59.583
without the muscles.

1149
01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:04.208
So when the island sinks again
in a hundred years

1150
01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:06.250
and the next dragon comes.

1151
01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.583
you're not gonna tie them up
or chase them or scare them.

1152
01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.958
You'll be their friend.

1153
01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:15.000
You have my word. Boris.

1154
01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:16.750
It will be done.

1155
01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:20.666
Tamir.

1156
01:24:22.666 --> 01:24:23.500
Tamir.

1157
01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:24.916
I--

1158
01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:36.666
-Bye! See ya!
-Bye. Boris.

1159
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.000
Bye. Boris!

1160
01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:39.333
Bye. hairy melon!

1161
01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:41.083
Bye. Wild Island!

1162
01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:47.416
Whoo-hoo!

1163
01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:09.458
Kwan! Kwan! Kwan! Look over here. Kwan.

1164
01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:12.750
-Can you just be quiet for one minute?
-Kwan. come on.

1165
01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:14.208
Elmer!

1166
01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.083
-Hey. Soda!
-You did it!

1167
01:25:17.166 --> 01:25:20.666
-Did what? What did he do?
-He helped me save the island. Kwan.

1168
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:23.208
You might wanna hitch a ride back!

1169
01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:28.875
I'm proud of you!

1170
01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:51.666
Soft landing.

1171
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:55.375
Yeah. Nicely done.

1172
01:25:55.458 --> 01:25:57.791
So this is Neverblue.

1173
01:25:57.875 --> 01:25:59.500
Nevergreen.

1174
01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:06.125
Oh.

1175
01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:09.000
Okay. What do you want me to do?

1176
01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:13.291
Nothing.

1177
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.958
What?

1178
01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:16.125
You wanna go home.

1179
01:26:16.791 --> 01:26:20.500
whistle to your family through the clouds
over Blueland. right?

1180
01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:22.416
Sure I do. more than anything.

1181
01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:24.541
What about the store?

1182
01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:28.166
And solving all your problems?
I mean. what are you gonna do?

1183
01:26:30.375 --> 01:26:31.500
I'll figure it out.

1184
01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.125
Are you scared?

1185
01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:36.041
Yeah.

1186
01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:37.375
Yeah.

1187
01:26:37.916 --> 01:26:39.291
Me too.

1188
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:47.666
-Well. I guess this is. uh…
-Um. I--

1189
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.166
-Goodbye.
-…it?

1190
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.916
It was nice to meet you.

1191
01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:10.458
I'll be seeing you. Boris.

1192
01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:14.833
If you ever need me…

1193
01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:57.250
Elmer!

1194
01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:01.833
Your mom's been looking for you.
Your supper's almost cold.

1195
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.375
-My supper?
-Elmer!

1196
01:28:09.916 --> 01:28:10.750
Mama.

1197
01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:22.708
-I'm sorry. Mom.
-And I'm sorry.

1198
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:23.625
I got scared.

1199
01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.541
I got scared too.

1200
01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:01.708
That ought to do it. Dela.

1201
01:29:06.416 --> 01:29:08.041
Oh. Perfect. Yeah.

1202
01:29:11.708 --> 01:29:12.791
Hey there.

1203
01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:18.000
-Come on. Hey. Mom. can I borrow your hat?
-That's my good one.

1204
01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:19.000
Thanks. Mom!

1205
01:29:19.083 --> 01:29:21.000
-Oh no.
-No! Elmer!

1206
01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:34.958
I was thinking how about
once I turn into an After Dragon.

1207
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:38.541
I make like I'm going to fly away.
but then-- Hey!

1208
01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:42.416
What took ya so long?

1209
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.375
I found some more props.

1210
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.416
-Okay.
-I got it. Callie.

1211
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.041
-That was the plan.

01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.583
<i>My father always said</i>

1215
01:29:54.666 --> 01:29:58.708
<i>that dragons make</i>
<i>the very best of friends.</i>

1216
01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:02.291
<i>They'll see you through</i>
<i>the scariest of times.</i>

1217
01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.708
<i>even if they're</i>
<i>a little bit scared themselves.</i>

1218
01:30:05.916 --> 01:30:10.041
<i>But for those of you who believe</i>
<i>that dragons are nothing but nonsense.</i>

1219
01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:15.958
<i>well… it's always good</i>
<i>to keep your ears open…</i>

01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:19.375
<i> …just in case.</i>
