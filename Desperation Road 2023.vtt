<i>It's like you
wake up one day</i>

4
00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:17.441
<i>and you're just here...</i>

5
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:21.706
<i>like a stone thrown
into this world.</i>

6
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.493
<i>But you don't know
who threw it.</i>

7
00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:29.061
<i>or which direction
it came from...</i>

8
00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.648
<i>"Go back to Mississippi."
you think.</i>

9
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.176
<i>Maybe there will be
a miracle...</i>

10
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.007
<i>some way to begin again...</i>

11
00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:13.062
- All right. turn
this side of your head.
- No.

12
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.891
Oh. look at how dirty
that is.

13
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:17.066
Mm.

14
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.374
<i>I wish it was true.</i>

15
00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:25.857
<i>God. I wish it was true.</i>

16
00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:55.887
<i>Mama?</i>

17
00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:57.019
<i>Yeah. baby?</i>

18
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.892
<i>Are we
in Mississippi yet?</i>

19
00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:03.155
<i>Yeah. we are.</i>

20
00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.680
<i>Can we stop walking now?</i>

21
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.423
<i>You said once we got
to Mississippi.
we could stop walking.</i>

22
00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:13.818
<i>Is that what I said?</i>

23
00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:19.433
We're gonna get
a place real soon. okay?

24
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:22.566
Now you got to go
to sleep.

25
00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:26.875
and you better dream about
that chocolate ice cream
that you had.

26
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:32.402
- Mama?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:34.665
Tell me about Mississippi again.

28
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:38.843
Mm... okay.

29
00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:40.758
Well...

30
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.067
Mississippi...

31
00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:47.243
was your daddy's
favorite place.

32
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.115
- Did you know that?
- No.

33
00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:53.162
He was born
and raised here.

34
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.904
and he swore
he'd never leave.

35
00:04:58.907 --> 00:05:03.303
He said that Mississippi
was the place of miracles.

36
00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:08.003
You think he'll give us
our miracle?

37
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:11.441
<i>Yeah. I do.</i>

38
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:15.140
<i>I think he's...</i>

39
00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:18.666
<i>...out there.
watching us...</i>

40
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.670
<i>making sure
that we're doing okay.</i>

41
00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.112
- I love you.
- Mm. I love you too. baby.

42
00:05:30.242 --> 00:05:31.548
- Good night.
- You gotta go to sleep.

43
00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:34.899
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

44
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.612
- What are you doing?
- Going back to my room.

45
00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:24.008
Excuse me. I just wanna
have a conversation
with you. ma'am.

46
00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.662
Please don't disrespect me.

47
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:28.622
Thank you.

48
00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.189
Now I'm guessing
you know it's not legal

49
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.409
to go in them trucks
and do them dirty things.

50
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.672
I didn't go
in no truck.

51
00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:38.632
Now I saw you
coming down
off them steps.

52
00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:40.155
Ned called us.

53
00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:43.637
All right? He's tired
of y'all trashing up
his parking lot.

54
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:46.161
See. this here
is a family establishment.

55
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:47.945
Well. I didn't do
nothin'. so...

56
00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:49.860
- Y'all never do.
- What are you doin'-- Hey!

57
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:51.993
I told you
that I didn't do--
I didn't do anything!

58
00:07:58.216 --> 00:08:00.088
- What're you doin'?!

59
00:08:00.218 --> 00:08:01.437
I got a kid in there. okay?

60
00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:03.004
- You can't do this.
- Shut your damn mouth!

61
00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:05.615
- I got a kid in there!
- Shut your damn mouth!

62
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.363
- Hey... hey!

63
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.584
Hey. I have my daughter
in the room

64
00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:19.977
and you can't leave her
in there. so...

65
00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:23.285
- And I'm telling you
the truth.
- Aw shucks.

66
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:25.896
See. I didn't leave her.
You did.

67
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.944
- Oh. stop crying.

68
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:32.512
Now you're not
going to jail.

69
00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:34.339
And if you were.
I'd have cuffed you already.

70
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.994
You just sit back
and relax.

71
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.561
And if you're
a good little girl.

72
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.304
if you're quieter
than a little church mouse.

73
00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:44.828
you might even get back
to your kid quicker
than you think.

74
00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:57.798
Now I know you know
I'm about to come back there.

75
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.149
A girl like you
shouldn't mind.

76
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.935
- See?

77
00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:08.373
I ain't gonna hurt you.

78
00:09:09.374 --> 00:09:11.376
Maybe we could even
be friends.

79
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.208
How about
a little mood lighting?

80
00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:19.384
That better?

81
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:37.968
Take off them dirty shoes.

82
00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:55.682
Good girl.
Now the rest.

83
00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:12.612
Now swing them legs
over to me.

84
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:20.445
There you go.

85
00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:26.756
If you wanna see
that motel room again...

86
00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.238
you better goddamn behave.

87
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.214
I wouldn't worry about that.
We ain't done just yet.

88
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.391
- You hear me?!

89
00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:37.914
Take it back off.

90
00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:48.359
I thought that was
what you wanted.

91
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.100
Yeah. it was.

92
00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:01.372
I did what you
told me to do.

93
00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:03.810
And you said that you would
take me back to my kid.

94
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.507
What do you think
would happen

95
00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:08.379
if that kid's momma
got picked up
for prostitution.

96
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.079
kid left there alone
in that shitty motel room?

97
00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:14.864
There's no food
or nothing in there either.

98
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:17.649
- Huh?

99
00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:20.522
Hey. old boy.

100
00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:22.306
Got us
some new entertainment.

101
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.788
Well. why don't you
come on out
and I'll show you?

102
00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:30.575
Same spot.
Y'all can both come.

103
00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.752
Yeah.

104
00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:36.407
Gon' be a party!

105
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.497
We're gonna have us
some company.

106
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.112
You want me to go out
on the hood
and wait for 'em?

107
00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:46.678
Now that's
the spirit!

108
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.420
And why not?

109
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.031
Be a nice
hood ornament.

110
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:54.164
Don't put nothin' on.

111
00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:01.476
Come on. then.

112
00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:28.546
Ain't got all night.

113
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.158
Attagirl.

114
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.464
It's hot.

115
00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:35.858
Yeah?

116
00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:37.599
Can I get my shirt
to sit on?

117
00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:39.731
Go on.

118
00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:42.865
Hurry up.

119
00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:03.538
Whoa. now.

120
00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:05.932
Are you
fuckin' kidding me?

121
00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:09.631
Don't you know not
to play with guns.
girl. huh?

122
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.068
That ain't a toy.
Put it down!

123
00:15:15.479 --> 00:15:17.873
Mommy!

124
00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:36.022
I know. baby. hang on.

125
00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:47.598
It's okay.
Hey. baby.

126
00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.731
Hey. I'm here. baby.

127
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:53.256
It's okay. shh...

128
00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:57.391
- I know. I know.
I'm so sorry.

129
00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:53.028
Welcome home.

130
00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:02.081
Hey...

131
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.129
They let you out early...

132
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.567
- ...but you still owe. motherfucker.

133
00:18:10.698 --> 00:18:12.917
- You still owe.
-  Hey!

134
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:14.963
Hey. stop it right there
or I'll call the law.

135
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.096
-  Well.
call 'em. asshole!
- I will call them.

136
00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.662
Just back off and go on!

137
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.361
Don't you worry.

138
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.928
You ain't
out of my reach. boy.

139
00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.462
You all right. man?

140
00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:37.594
Jesus.

141
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.960
Home. sweet fucking home.

142
00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.089
Hey. there.
old man.

143
00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:49.884
Heads up
would have been nice.

144
00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:51.277
Told you I was
getting out soon.

145
00:19:51.407 --> 00:19:52.887
Well. I could've
come pick you up.

146
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:54.193
Nah. I didn't want
to bother you.

147
00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:56.020
Nah. it weren't
no bother.

148
00:19:56.978 --> 00:19:58.849
Ahem.

149
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.025
This here's Consuela.

150
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:05.073
<i>- Es mi hijo.
- SÃ­.</i> Same eyes.

151
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.510
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>

152
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.165
Nice to meet you.

153
00:20:11.427 --> 00:20:14.082
Speaking of eyes.
what happened to your face?

154
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.780
Just a little going away
present from the boys
on the inside.

155
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:18.652
- I suppose.
- Hmm.

156
00:20:21.524 --> 00:20:23.309
I figure he could use
a little meat
on his bones.

157
00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:25.136
This woman can cook.

158
00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:27.095
Come on. you look like
you need something to eat.
Come here.

159
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.011
- Jeez. I just walked
all the way over here.
- Oh. hell.

160
00:20:31.882 --> 00:20:33.406
Where'd she
come from?

161
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:38.019
I went to visit
your uncle Clive
down in Bogalusa.

162
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:42.110
I saw her working
in a sugar cane field.

163
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.069
Big brown eyes
kept watching me
everywhere I went.

164
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.333
and she kept
laughing at me.

165
00:20:47.463 --> 00:20:50.597
Anyway. I figured
I'd go and ask her
why she was laughing.

166
00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:54.035
I mean. you should've seen
how he had them workers livin'.
in them ratty shacks.

167
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:58.169
and... she didn't have
nobody and neither did I. so...

168
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.084
I asked her if she wanted
to come and stay with me.

169
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:02.435
and she said yes
and she's been here
ever since.

170
00:21:02.565 --> 00:21:04.480
- And the rest is history.
- Yep.

171
00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:06.439
You're speaking
Spanish now.

172
00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:09.006
<i>Muy poco</i>.
but she gets it.

173
00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:12.314
I'll bet she does.
you sly dog.

174
00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:15.186
It ain't like that.
You get your mind
out of the gutter.

175
00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:16.666
Where she sleep?

176
00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:19.278
Um. in your old room.
in the barn.

177
00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:22.106
- You liar.
- Oh. gimme that.

178
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:43.214
It got awful quiet here
when your mama passed.

179
00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:49.482
Some nights I'd sit
out here and...

180
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.616
it sounded as if the world
had come to an end.

181
00:21:58.491 --> 00:22:01.145
I tried to quit
feeling bad about it.

182
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:03.104
I hope your mama understands.

183
00:22:03.234 --> 00:22:06.412
Oh. I can't figure
she'd mind.

184
00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:10.111
You can't feel any worse
about her than I do.

185
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:14.245
I know it hurt her
me being where I was
while she was dying.

186
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.903
Well. she loved you.
And that's all that matters.

187
00:22:25.953 --> 00:22:29.609
I wrote you a bunch
of letters I didn't send.

188
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:33.743
You know. I figured
you didn't need
the extra weight.

189
00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:36.006
You didn't need more shit.
mine or anyone else's.

190
00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:37.791
Well. that's okay.
I'm here now.

191
00:22:39.314 --> 00:22:40.707
Give me all the shit
you got.

192
00:22:47.931 --> 00:22:50.760
You still got
that old thing. huh?

193
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:52.632
You talkin'
about the Bible?

194
00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:55.852
She and I sit out here.

195
00:22:55.983 --> 00:22:58.333
helps her
with her English.
She reads.

196
00:22:58.464 --> 00:23:00.988
Just like you and me
used to read when you
was learnin'. remember?

197
00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:03.469
- Yeah. I remember.
- You used to love
those old stories.

198
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.253
Daniel in the lion's den
was your favorite.

199
00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.125
I don't really believe
in none of that no more.

200
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:09.823
What. that the lions
didn't eat him?

201
00:23:09.953 --> 00:23:11.955
Nah. I don't believe
in none of it.

202
00:23:16.003 --> 00:23:18.919
I used to go
to these prison chapel
meetings sometimes.

203
00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:21.312
An old white-haired preacher.
a bunch of outlaws

204
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.271
sittin' in all
these folding chairs.

205
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.839
yelling their hallelujahs.

206
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:30.539
Preacher'd get up.
give his sermon.

207
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.149
And everybody get
to take turns.

208
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.587
getting up at the pulpit.
give their testimonies.

209
00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:37.198
"Yes. I stole."
"Yes. I raped."

210
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:40.897
"Yes. I beat the shit
out of my fellow man."

211
00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:42.725
"But now I found
the love of God.

212
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.510
now I see the light."

213
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.163
And so on. and so on.

214
00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:48.601
and all their clappings
and "amens." and shit.

215
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:51.430
and I just didn't care
for it. so I stopped going.

216
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.822
Hmm.

217
00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:56.913
Do you think it's fair?

218
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:58.828
What? Do I think
what's fair?

219
00:23:58.959 --> 00:23:59.829
Tsk...

220
00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:03.659
Well. that man can get
into the magic Kingdom

221
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.270
no matter what they done.

222
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.447
as long as they say
the magic words.

223
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:11.798
Words have power
if you mean them.

224
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:17.107
And it doesn't matter
what you and me think
is fair.

225
00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:18.761
This Good Book

226
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:21.068
tells me that the door
is always open.

227
00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:23.549
Let me ask you something.

228
00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:25.420
How's what you did
different?

229
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.423
'Cause I made
one big fucking mistake!

230
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:31.339
And I didn't mean it.
They meant it.

231
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.168
Damn right.
And you ain't them.

232
00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:36.562
You made
a big fucking mistake

233
00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:38.477
and you did
your time for it.

234
00:24:38.607 --> 00:24:40.348
Well. in whose eyes?

235
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:44.700
Mine? Theirs?

236
00:24:45.962 --> 00:24:48.138
I have an accident.
I get swooped away

237
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:49.836
and locked away
behind these bars.

238
00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:51.315
Don't get to show
my remorse.

239
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.404
get my sorrys
to nobody that I hurt.

240
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:56.364
Ain't you. ain't me.
ain't nobody out there

241
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.062
just gonna snap
their fingers

242
00:24:59.193 --> 00:25:02.283
and instill some sort
of forgiveness in me.

243
00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:06.548
Son. you're being
awful damn hard
on yourself.

244
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.860
I got to believe
we can be forgiven.

245
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.776
'Cause if we can't. well.
then we're all fucked.

246
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.394
It was them boys that did
that to your face.
wasn't it?

247
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.527
Waitin' at the bus stop.
soon as I pulled in.

248
00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:31.355
Yeah. fuckin' Larry.

249
00:25:31.486 --> 00:25:34.533
Got you set up
at. uh.

250
00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:38.667
one of my places there
at. uh. Michigan Avenue.

251
00:25:38.798 --> 00:25:40.626
Here's your car keys.
got the keys to the place--

252
00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.802
It's that old place
we put the shutters on.
you remember?

253
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:44.630
Oh. I know.
How could I forget?

254
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.589
Yeah. but. uh. listen.
why don't you
just stay out here.

255
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.939
you give those fellas
some time to cool off?

256
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.202
Oh. they ain't
coolin' off
any time soon.

257
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:53.856
'Sides. they know
where you live.

258
00:25:53.987 --> 00:25:57.033
They can pull up the driveway
just as easy as I can.

259
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.167
I ain't bringin' that
out here.

260
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:04.606
Well. I've got
something for you.
Hang on to these.

261
00:26:14.442 --> 00:26:16.270
Here.

262
00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:23.538
I don't recall anything
about no hunting rifle
in the New Testament.

263
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:27.847
Well. you can only turn
so many cheeks.
and I only got four. so...

264
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:32.068
I'd be breaking
about two dozen laws
just by having it.

265
00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:34.114
I'd feel a whole lot better
knowing you're safe.

266
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:37.378
- Ain't gon' be that bad.
- Well. you don't know
how it's gonna get.

267
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.905
Okay.

268
00:26:47.823 --> 00:26:49.782
<i>Do you ever think
about that moment?</i>

269
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:54.264
<i>That moment I got
a little too big. too old.</i>

270
00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:56.266
<i>too heavy for you to carry?</i>

271
00:26:56.397 --> 00:27:00.357
<i>You think to yourself.
"Goddamn! I can't carry
my son no more."</i>

272
00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:05.841
<i>You don't have to carry me
no more. Dad.</i>

273
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.192
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

274
00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:48.754
- Thank you.

275
00:27:50.843 --> 00:27:52.105
Shot of Bug. please.

276
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:53.008
Get out of the truck!
Show me your hands!

277
00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:01.974
Slowly.

278
00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:13.376
Get that goddamn thing
out of my face. Boyd!

279
00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:16.771
Well. I'll be damned!

280
00:30:16.902 --> 00:30:18.381
- When'd you get home?
- Noon.

281
00:30:18.512 --> 00:30:20.819
- Noon today?
- Noon today.

282
00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:22.559
Give me some love. man.
Don't stand there.

283
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.909
- All right.

284
00:30:27.913 --> 00:30:29.523
Stop it.

285
00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:31.481
We grown now. You can't be
lifting me up like that.

286
00:30:31.612 --> 00:30:33.875
- Oh. I got you.

287
00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:36.138
Well. talk to me.
How was it?

288
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:39.925
About what you can imagine.
'cept way fucking worse.

289
00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:45.104
How's Lacey? She still
turning backflips?

290
00:30:45.234 --> 00:30:46.888
God no! She couldn't put
her right leg

291
00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:48.977
in that old cheerleader
outfit if she wanted to.

292
00:30:50.674 --> 00:30:52.502
You gotta love her.
though. man. You got to.

293
00:30:54.243 --> 00:30:55.941
So what's goin' on here?

294
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:58.726
Ain't no point
in keeping it a secret.

295
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.249
Be on the news tomorrow.

296
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.425
One of our own shot
with his own pistol.

297
00:31:02.556 --> 00:31:03.905
which we can't seem
to find.

298
00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.690
- Shit.

299
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:08.170
Anyone I know?

300
00:31:08.301 --> 00:31:10.956
Nah. this guy came down
from Tupelo or somewhere

301
00:31:11.086 --> 00:31:12.174
a year or two back.

302
00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:15.134
Been on thin ice
ever since he got here.

303
00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:18.528
So I wouldn't be surprised
if something ain't catch
back up to his ass.

304
00:31:18.659 --> 00:31:20.922
Just hate for Lacey
to find out about this one.

305
00:31:21.053 --> 00:31:23.316
She stays worried enough
about me. you know?

306
00:31:23.446 --> 00:31:25.013
Oh. I bet.

307
00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:28.190
Well. they're gonna ask me
if I checked you out. so...

308
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:30.366
I gotta check you out.
see what's in the truck.

309
00:31:30.497 --> 00:31:32.629
Okay. yeah.
Open it up.

310
00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:45.468
Russ. you ain't been out
24 hours.

311
00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:48.558
Shit. man! You know
you ain't supposed
to have no gun.

312
00:31:48.689 --> 00:31:51.257
Just got out
of the damn cage. Boyd.

313
00:31:51.387 --> 00:31:52.867
You don't know
what that feels like.

314
00:31:52.998 --> 00:31:54.825
- You wanna go back
to the cage?
- No.

315
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.479
Didn't think so.
so if I was you.

316
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.046
get in the truck
and call it a night.

317
00:32:01.223 --> 00:32:02.442
Yes. officer.

318
00:32:19.328 --> 00:32:20.460
<i>This is it.</i>

319
00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:24.551
You have the whole place
to yourselves.

320
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:27.075
The doors lock
at 8 p.m.

321
00:32:27.206 --> 00:32:29.643
If you go out.
you need a password
to get in.

322
00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:32.646
Oh. hey. you wait.
You let me help you
get up there.

323
00:32:32.776 --> 00:32:34.082
Well. let me help
put your bags away.

324
00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:36.519
No. We're good.

325
00:32:38.434 --> 00:32:39.696
Is. uh...

326
00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:41.220
Is there anything
I can do for-for work?

327
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.743
I mean. I'll do
just about anything.

328
00:32:42.873 --> 00:32:44.788
There's a bar
up the road

329
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:47.313
where you can help
with the dishes
and work in the kitchen.

330
00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:50.881
Now. it ain't much.
but he pays out
at the end of the day.

331
00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:55.277
Can I work today?

332
00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:56.844
You look
like you need a break.

333
00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:58.411
I don't.

334
00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:01.675
You sure nobody's
following you?

335
00:33:01.805 --> 00:33:03.590
We get that.

336
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.943
Didn't you tell her
that she could have
a hot dog?

337
00:33:09.074 --> 00:33:10.031
Hmm?

338
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:13.121
- You want a hot dog?
- Come on. baby.

339
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:01.604
Sometimes I have a hard time
remembering how old he'd be.

340
00:34:01.735 --> 00:34:04.651
I ride by here
just to remind myself.

341
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:06.044
You ever do that?

342
00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:08.568
I could say
at anytime...

343
00:34:08.698 --> 00:34:11.745
exactly how old
he'd be.

344
00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:13.834
Twenty-five years.
three months.

345
00:34:13.964 --> 00:34:16.184
Yeah. I wish
I could do that.

346
00:34:18.273 --> 00:34:19.883
It's all right.

347
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:23.800
You got a busy life.
you got a family.

348
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:25.454
Ain't nobody blamin' you.

349
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.678
Besides...
I remember enough
for the both of us.

350
00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:42.341
Why do you always
do that?

351
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:46.214
His toll.
To bring him home.

352
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:50.653
There's always
a price to pay.

353
00:35:01.273 --> 00:35:03.362
I like that.

354
00:35:10.847 --> 00:35:13.850
Man. it's no wonder
these boys are stacked
like brick houses.

355
00:35:13.981 --> 00:35:14.938
you feedin' them like that.

356
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:16.331
Well. they're hearty eaters.

357
00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:17.463
Boys...

358
00:35:18.812 --> 00:35:20.988
Well. I thank you
much. Lacey.

359
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:21.989
That was damn good.

360
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.947
We're just glad
you're home.

361
00:35:24.078 --> 00:35:26.472
I'm just glad these boys
took after you.

362
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:29.997
-  Your mouth
to God's ears.
-  Hey. now.

363
00:35:33.218 --> 00:35:34.958
Oh. I see
you're up to mischief.

364
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:38.484
- 'Bout that time?

365
00:35:38.614 --> 00:35:40.790
Don't act
like you don't know.

366
00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:02.116
Why the hell
you didn't call me
knowing you was getting out?

367
00:36:02.247 --> 00:36:03.683
Hmm?

368
00:36:03.813 --> 00:36:06.120
You know I would've drove
down there and got you.

369
00:36:07.991 --> 00:36:09.819
You know it don't work
like that.

370
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.952
Tsk. see. uh...

371
00:36:12.082 --> 00:36:13.693
that's where you're wrong.

372
00:36:13.823 --> 00:36:15.390
I got special privileges.

373
00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:17.914
Flash 'em the old badge.

374
00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:22.832
- Special privileges.
- Well. I'll just
show 'em mine.

375
00:36:22.963 --> 00:36:24.356
That didn't work anyways.

376
00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:25.835
- And it's bigger.

377
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:28.577
Always has been.
always will be.

378
00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:32.799
All fools.

379
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.760
Tsk. Larry had it figured.

380
00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:41.547
That's what happened
to your face?

381
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:42.809
Sure is.

382
00:36:43.897 --> 00:36:45.681
How serious do you think
the brothers are?

383
00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:48.728
Oh. I don't know
how serious they are together.

384
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:51.034
I know Larry's
pretty serious
all on his own.

385
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:54.168
You want me to go
say something?

386
00:36:54.299 --> 00:36:55.909
- 'Cause you know I will.
- No. Shit. no.

387
00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:58.259
I've dealt with way worse
since the last time
I saw you.

388
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.262
Besides. Larry's
just a puppy dog.
comparatively speaking.

389
00:37:01.393 --> 00:37:04.613
Yeah. an aggravating.
chew-up-your-shit
puppy dog. though.

390
00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:06.963
There's a big difference.

391
00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:08.269
Well. you know...

392
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.014
How you doin'?
You doin' okay?

393
00:37:14.144 --> 00:37:15.668
Doing good.

394
00:37:18.192 --> 00:37:20.063
Russ. come on.

395
00:37:20.194 --> 00:37:21.630
How you really doin'?

396
00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:25.852
Thought I'd feel
a little different.

397
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:28.768
Feels good
all at the same time. but...

398
00:37:28.898 --> 00:37:31.118
I don't know.

399
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.424
You seen her yet?

400
00:37:33.425 --> 00:37:34.817
No. not yet.

401
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:37.080
But it's a small town.

402
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:40.083
I'm bound to run into her
sooner or later.

403
00:37:40.214 --> 00:37:42.869
Man...

404
00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:47.265
We burned up a lot of miles
and a lot of time
out on those roads.

405
00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:48.483
I missed that.

406
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.618
Turns out.
I missed you too. bro.

407
00:37:52.748 --> 00:37:56.012
Oh. don't get
all gushy on me.

408
00:37:58.754 --> 00:38:00.190
I missed you too. bud.

409
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:02.976
I knew it.
I knew it.

410
00:40:37.783 --> 00:40:40.481
<i>How long
have you been here?</i>

411
00:40:40.612 --> 00:40:41.656
<i>All morning.</i>

412
00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:45.051
<i>Hadn't gotten up
the courage to knock.</i>

413
00:40:46.922 --> 00:40:48.881
You look the same.

414
00:40:49.011 --> 00:40:51.797
-  Please.
- You do.

415
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:56.715
Well... you look like
you could use a hot meal.

416
00:40:58.325 --> 00:41:00.153
You know. people
keep saying that to me.

417
00:41:00.283 --> 00:41:02.590
but nobody's offered
to buy me any dinner.

418
00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.640
You all right?

419
00:41:11.817 --> 00:41:13.558
Yeah. I'm okay.

420
00:41:15.734 --> 00:41:16.648
You?

421
00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:21.087
Oh. yes.

422
00:41:21.217 --> 00:41:22.784
I'm all right.

423
00:41:28.573 --> 00:41:30.966
I bet your daddy's happy
that you're home.

424
00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:35.536
I was sorry
about your mama.

425
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:37.451
Yeah...

426
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:42.151
Yeah. boy.

427
00:41:42.282 --> 00:41:45.024
Sure would've been nice
for her to see me make it.

428
00:41:48.331 --> 00:41:50.551
I bet she's smiling.

429
00:41:56.905 --> 00:41:58.341
Remodeling?

430
00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:02.345
Hurricane last night.

431
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:04.086
I bet.

432
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:05.697
That hurricane
got a name?

433
00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:07.176
Oh. they usually do.

434
00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:19.841
You still mad
at me?

435
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.932
I told you then
like I'll tell you now.

436
00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:27.545
Ain't nothing
to be mad about.

437
00:42:31.157 --> 00:42:33.376
Seems like you told me
the same thing.

438
00:42:34.987 --> 00:42:36.031
I knows it.

439
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.992
I just wondered.

440
00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:45.606
I'm the one that told you
to stop coming to see me.

441
00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:49.871
But I'm the one
who agreed.

442
00:42:59.315 --> 00:43:01.056
How many kids?

443
00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:05.408
I got twin boys
and a little girl.

444
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:06.801
How old?

445
00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:12.590
My boys are four
and the girl is two.

446
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:26.604
Man. all I want to do
is hold your hand right now.

447
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.607
Just for one minute.

448
00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:24.749
There's a whole lot
between us now.

449
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:30.189
A whole lot...

450
00:44:36.761 --> 00:44:38.763
I can't keep it anymore.

451
00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:42.114
But it's yours.

452
00:44:43.855 --> 00:44:45.508
It was.

453
00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:49.382
I gotta go.

454
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.823
Hello.

455
00:45:39.824 --> 00:45:42.565
- Mommy!

456
00:45:42.696 --> 00:45:45.699
Hi. baby. Thank you
for watching her.

457
00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:49.181
- What are you doing?
- Coloring.

458
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:51.052
Red? Too scary.
Too scary.

459
00:45:51.183 --> 00:45:52.662
- Purple!
- Yeah!

460
00:45:52.793 --> 00:45:55.665
Purple. a really
nice light...

461
00:45:55.796 --> 00:45:58.756
- shade of purple.
- Yeah.

462
00:45:58.886 --> 00:46:00.496
<i>Tell me about Daddy.</i>

463
00:46:04.022 --> 00:46:05.110
Well...

464
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.026
<i>You have his eyes.</i>

465
00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:10.985
<i>- I do?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

466
00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:16.817
<i>And he would've been
able to make you
laugh so hard</i>

467
00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:20.168
<i>that I think
you would've broken ribs.</i>

468
00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:25.521
<i>And he was just...</i>

469
00:46:26.827 --> 00:46:28.786
so real.

470
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.484
And so kind.

471
00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:35.531
<i>And he was my first everything.</i>

472
00:46:38.883 --> 00:46:40.710
And together
we made you.

473
00:46:42.843 --> 00:46:45.280
And you're...

474
00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:48.370
the most important thing
in the whole world.
do you know that?

475
00:46:51.504 --> 00:46:52.722
Hmm?

476
00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:09.043
- Analee... Analee.
where's our stuff?
- Yeah?

477
00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:10.610
In there?

478
00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:15.180
Who told you
to empty the bag?

479
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.443
I-I-I didn't do it.
The lady did.

480
00:47:21.664 --> 00:47:24.406
- Get on your shoes.
-  What for?

481
00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:27.757
Do what I say
and put your shoes on
and get your stuff.

482
00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:29.324
But I don't wanna go!

483
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:32.110
Baby. shh! I know
you wanna stay here.

484
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.808
- but we gotta go.
- W-what's happening?

485
00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:37.463
Just listen to me.
Do what I say
and put your shoes on.

486
00:47:37.593 --> 00:47:39.291
And get the rest
of your stuff over there.

487
00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:41.249
- You said we could
stop walking...
- I know what I said.

488
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.078
- ...once we got
to Mississippi--
- Hey! Baby!

489
00:47:44.209 --> 00:47:46.864
Look at me. I love you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

490
00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:48.996
but you gotta do
what I'm telling you
to do right now.

491
00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:50.780
Do you get it?

492
00:47:52.652 --> 00:47:54.262
- Mommy. where are we going?

493
00:47:55.655 --> 00:47:57.526
I want my crayons.

494
00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:00.660
- Mommy!
- Shh!

495
00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:08.276
Okay. this way.

496
00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:13.542
Okay. Now you have
to be so quiet.

497
00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:16.328
No talking.

498
00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:18.025
We're playing
the silent game

499
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:20.288
- and you wanna win. right?
- Yeah.

500
00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:27.513
I want my crayons.

501
00:48:29.384 --> 00:48:32.518
- You're gonna lose
if you say anything.
-  Okay.

502
00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:40.265
I don't know...

503
00:48:42.745 --> 00:48:45.139
I found it
unpacking their clothes.

504
00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:50.797
I get the feeling
they're in some kind
of trouble.

505
00:48:52.668 --> 00:48:54.975
Okay.

506
00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:57.543
Okay. listen to me.
baby girl.

507
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.547
Mommy messed up. okay?

508
00:49:01.677 --> 00:49:05.203
I messed up really bad.
Big mistake.

509
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:08.032
But you wanna stay
with Mommy. right?

510
00:49:08.162 --> 00:49:10.686
'Cause I really want
to stay with you

511
00:49:10.817 --> 00:49:12.601
and. if we're gonna
stay together.

512
00:49:12.732 --> 00:49:15.604
we have to go right now.

513
00:49:15.735 --> 00:49:19.260
And you have to do exactly
what I'm about to tell you
to do. okay?

514
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:20.522
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

515
00:49:32.578 --> 00:49:34.275
Can we go yet?

516
00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:36.843
Okay.

517
00:49:38.497 --> 00:49:41.195
Okay. Go. Go!

518
00:50:31.202 --> 00:50:32.464
Hello?

519
00:50:34.379 --> 00:50:36.642
Wait. Where's Analee?

520
00:50:38.209 --> 00:50:40.124
She's not in the room?

521
00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:43.649
Is the mother back?

522
00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.229
Hello?

523
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.017
Analee. is that you. honey?

524
00:51:05.932 --> 00:51:07.412
Is anyone there?

525
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.688
-  Don't move.

526
00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:10.388
Get in the truck.

527
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.305
Will you get
in the truck?

528
00:52:14.435 --> 00:52:16.350
- All right?
- I'm goin'.

529
00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:17.743
Hurry up.

530
00:52:38.372 --> 00:52:40.548
Okay. just turn on
the car.

531
00:52:40.679 --> 00:52:42.855
Turn on the car
and drive!

532
00:52:42.985 --> 00:52:45.031
- Where?

533
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:49.209
Just-just go.
Get a-- Get away
from the lights.

534
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.776
North. go North.

535
00:52:55.346 --> 00:52:56.738
- Mama?
- Yeah. baby.

536
00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:59.088
I gotta pee
really badly.

537
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:03.528
Okay. how bad
do you have to pee?

538
00:53:03.658 --> 00:53:07.358
- Really badly.
Can we stop. please?
- We'll find her a place.

539
00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:09.577
I got a place
for you to pee.

540
00:53:11.362 --> 00:53:14.060
And you can lower
that pistol as well.

541
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.627
Lot of potholes out here.

542
00:53:15.757 --> 00:53:17.498
don't need you
accidentally shooting me.

543
00:53:17.629 --> 00:53:20.066
Didn't come this far
to have it read
on my tombstone

544
00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:22.199
"Accidentally shot
by some woman."

545
00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:28.205
If I shoot you.
it's not an accident.

546
00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:34.211
Tsk. Understood.

547
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:43.307
You hurry up. Okay?
Go pee fast--

548
00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:46.266
- Hey!
- No. No!

549
00:53:46.397 --> 00:53:47.746
Fucking give that
back to me.

550
00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:50.096
Oh. I think
I'll hold on to that.

551
00:53:58.713 --> 00:54:00.280
This ain't your gun.

552
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:05.938
Can you just
give me back that gun?

553
00:54:06.068 --> 00:54:07.766
You can empty it out.
I don't care. just--

554
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:11.204
- Just give it back to me.
- I will...

555
00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:14.076
when you tell me
who it belongs to.

556
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:23.999
I tried to fix all this...

557
00:54:26.437 --> 00:54:29.048
before it even started.

558
00:54:29.178 --> 00:54:31.224
You know.
I went down...

559
00:54:33.095 --> 00:54:35.533
to this place in New Orleans
when I found out
I was pregnant.

560
00:54:35.663 --> 00:54:37.665
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

561
00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:40.755
Maybe it was.

562
00:54:46.065 --> 00:54:47.284
But as I--

563
00:54:49.024 --> 00:54:51.723
As I was sittin' there.
in that room. waiting.

564
00:54:51.853 --> 00:54:54.116
and I don't know.
I just started thinking
that. you know.

565
00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:56.858
maybe everything
was going to be okay.

566
00:54:59.034 --> 00:55:01.341
I've tried
so fucking hard...

567
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.390
You know. I actually
didn't even know a person
could. uh...

568
00:55:08.566 --> 00:55:11.046
could try that hard.

569
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:15.834
But you know. uh...
nowhere worked out.

570
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:18.271
Not Shreveport. not...

571
00:55:18.402 --> 00:55:21.840
not Beaumont.
not Lake Charles. and...

572
00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:27.759
I can't feed her.

573
00:55:30.152 --> 00:55:32.372
I can't put
clothes on her.

574
00:55:34.113 --> 00:55:37.812
I can't give her
a fucking place to sleep
and now this.

575
00:55:37.943 --> 00:55:40.424
So yeah... [sniffles] Uh...

576
00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:44.863
If you could just
leave us here...

577
00:55:44.993 --> 00:55:46.778
Please...

578
00:55:46.908 --> 00:55:48.736
And what about
your family?

579
00:55:49.955 --> 00:55:53.698
What about her daddy?
What about your mama?

580
00:55:55.743 --> 00:55:58.180
Not everybody
has somebody.

581
00:56:06.885 --> 00:56:08.756
So where to now?

582
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:14.240
I'll make you a promise.

583
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:18.940
I'll drive you anywhere.
within reason.

584
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:21.900
But we're gonna
take a rest tonight.

585
00:56:23.118 --> 00:56:23.989
Okay?

586
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:34.869
<i>I knew
it wasn't gonna end.</i>

587
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:40.397
<i>All I could see
was her face.</i>

588
00:56:40.527 --> 00:56:42.268
Thinking that I'd left her.

589
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.402
thinking that nobody
in the whole world
cared about her.

590
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:52.104
So I stole his gun
and I shot him.

591
00:56:52.234 --> 00:56:54.323
I shot him
until he wasn't movin'
no more.

592
00:57:03.594 --> 00:57:05.596
But you don't look
like a killer to me.

593
00:57:08.033 --> 00:57:10.862
I've seen plenty.
I know what they look like.

594
00:57:23.657 --> 00:57:26.617
Why are you holdin' on
to that gun. anyway?

595
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.447
You know that damn thing
gon' bury you.

596
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:36.148
If there's one thing
in the world
that could bury you...

597
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.152
would you wanna know
where it was?

598
00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:45.157
What's your name?

599
00:58:06.874 --> 00:58:08.180
Got her?

600
00:58:09.703 --> 00:58:12.097
You guys just sleep in here.
I'll take the back.

601
00:58:19.713 --> 00:58:21.019
Maben.

602
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:27.460
My name's Maben.

603
00:58:33.292 --> 00:58:34.336
I'm Russell.

604
00:58:59.274 --> 00:59:00.928
Maben...

605
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:07.456
You gotta be kiddin' me.

606
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.203
Cody?

607
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:19.512
Cody. boy.

608
00:59:21.688 --> 00:59:25.300
Big papa's home.
Big--

609
00:59:26.606 --> 00:59:27.825
Hey. Hey. I--

610
00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:29.566
Look. I know
that it's--

611
00:59:29.696 --> 00:59:32.003
- You're not supposed
to be here.

612
00:59:32.133 --> 00:59:34.092
- I know. I know.
- Go on. Larry.
Go on. Come on.

613
00:59:34.222 --> 00:59:37.182
Look. look.

614
00:59:37.312 --> 00:59:40.577
- Is Cody here?
- 'Course he's here.

615
00:59:40.707 --> 00:59:43.144
- Could I-could I see him
for a minute?
- Oh. Larry.

616
00:59:43.275 --> 00:59:45.538
- It's the middle of the night.
- Baby. baby. please. please.

617
00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:47.018
No. it's the middle
of the night.

618
00:59:47.148 --> 00:59:48.541
I just wanna see him
for a minute.

619
00:59:52.501 --> 00:59:54.112
I see you've been drinking.

620
00:59:57.158 --> 00:59:59.421
Yeah. Yeah.
I've been drinking.

621
01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.997
I just got
one question. okay?

622
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.913
Is-is-is he still
playing Little League?

623
01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:18.484
- Is he still playing?
Is he-is he--

624
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.313
Is he swinging the bat
like his Daddy showed him?

625
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:24.925
He's too big
for Little League. Larry!

626
01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:26.405
Goddammit!

627
01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:28.755
You'd know that
if you saw him.

628
01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:31.279
Well. fuck!
You won't let me see him.

629
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.934
That ain't fuckin' fair!
What are you talking about.
"if I saw him"?

630
01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:35.893
I've been tryin' to see him.
that's why I'm here!

631
01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:38.939
Get sober
and you can see
your son.

632
01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.507
- That's what I said.
-  I'm fuckin' trying!

633
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.291
- Not hard enough!
- Cody. boy!

634
01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:46.773
You fuckin' be quiet!
We got a restraining order.

635
01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:48.819
I don't wanna have to call
somebody. please.

636
01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.211
Who the fuck
you gonna call?

637
01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.213
Huh?
You fuckin' call 'em!

638
01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:54.172
I remember
that restraining order.
Fuck you!

639
01:00:54.302 --> 01:00:56.522
- Call! You call!
- I will fuckin' call
somebody out here.

640
01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.394
I will call
somebody out here.
You get out! Get out!

641
01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:03.007
- You hear that. boy?

642
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:06.706
- Your Daddy's out here.
trying to see you!

643
01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:11.885
Don't ever fuckin' say
I didn't try. boy!

644
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:16.716
Don't ever say
I didn't fuckin--

645
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.748
- Baby girl.

646
01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:58.715
- Time to wake up.
- Okay.

647
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.545
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah.

648
01:02:03.676 --> 01:02:05.025
Yeah?

649
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.422
I have a present for you.

650
01:02:10.552 --> 01:02:12.511
- You do?
- Yeah. I forgot about it

651
01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:16.210
until I was lookin'
at you while you were asleep.

652
01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:22.129
Crayons?

653
01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:26.438
- In all
of your favorite colors.
- Thank you. mama.

654
01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.396
- Thank you. mama.

655
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.928
- All right. who wants
to get out of here

656
01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:40.060
and go get a bite to eat
for breakfast?

657
01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:42.541
I got us a plan.

658
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.413
What's the plan?

659
01:02:45.544 --> 01:02:47.764
I know a place you can go.

660
01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.767
Somewhere safe.

661
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:55.336
If I'm gonna trust you.
you're gonna have
to trust me.

662
01:02:57.338 --> 01:02:58.600
Okay?

663
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:02.648
We're gonna get
a little bite to eat. huh?

664
01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.694
Oh. we'll fill that belly.

665
01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:07.348
- Sleep all right?

666
01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:13.833
-  <i>G'morning. Mr. Gaines.</i>
-  <i>Boyd!</i>

667
01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:15.443
<i>You happen to see Russell
this morning?</i>

668
01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:17.228
Uh. not yet.

669
01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:18.751
Any idea where he is?

670
01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.797
No. I was looking for 'im.
You went by the house?

671
01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:23.538
I did. I did.
saw the windows.

672
01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:25.453
Is that what this is about?

673
01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:31.068
After we found our man.
Russell came drivin' up.

674
01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:33.722
Just him. nobody else
all night. way out there.

675
01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:36.029
so... I gotta ask him
about it. that's all.

676
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.815
Maybe he mighta seen
something that we're not?

677
01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:41.426
- That's it?
- That's it. I swear.

678
01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.471
I'm sorry to hear
about your man.

679
01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:45.604
Thank you. Yeah.

680
01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:48.172
Well. I just need his eyes.
Just have him call me. please?

681
01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:49.434
I will. Oh. and Boyd.

682
01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:51.697
Um. keep an eye
on them boys. will you?

683
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.394
Especially Larry.

684
01:03:53.525 --> 01:03:55.701
I can guarantee it was him
that busted out them windows.

685
01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.964
They already put a knot
on the side of his head

686
01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.618
when they met him
at the bus station.

687
01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:03.274
I'll pay attention.

688
01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:05.276
Thanks. Boyd.

689
01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:16.287
You girls
sit tight here.

690
01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:21.988
Got some company.

691
01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:29.256
Oh. it's good to see
you're still breathing.

692
01:04:29.387 --> 01:04:31.650
You gotta remember
there's people
give a shit about you.

693
01:04:33.826 --> 01:04:35.828
What the hell
is going on?

694
01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.352
I mean. the place
was all busted up.
I assume you didn't do it.

695
01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:42.052
I ain't worried
about none of that
right now.

696
01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:45.403
I'm gonna ask you a question.
all I need is a yes or no.

697
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:48.928
I need that old place
in the barn for them.

698
01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:50.930
I'll explain
everything later.

699
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:53.237
Boyd was snooping around.
I mean. something
you ain't tellin' me.

700
01:04:53.367 --> 01:04:54.803
Yes or no.
that's all I need.

701
01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.631
Oh. yeah. there's something
you ain't telling me.

702
01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.503
All right. well.
I got your back.

703
01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:01.245
But you got-- you know.
don't keep me
in the dark here.

704
01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:06.206
I want you to pretend

705
01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:08.730
it's that first time
you saw Consuela...

706
01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.734
and you did what you did
because you thought
it was right.

707
01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:16.738
- They look hungry.

708
01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:18.523
I make food.

709
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:21.308
Very kind of you.
Consuela. Thank you.

710
01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:23.354
One more thing.
Don't tell anyone
they're here.

711
01:05:23.484 --> 01:05:25.486
Well. I'm not
a complete idiot.

712
01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:38.760
-  It's pretty big.
- Well...

713
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.153
Here it is.

714
01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.461
Go on in.

715
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.861
Bet you probably expected
something to go moo
when you came in then.

716
01:06:05.396 --> 01:06:07.833
Hopefully this is
comfortable for y'all.

717
01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.880
Bathroom is
right over there.

718
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.057
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

719
01:06:15.406 --> 01:06:17.364
It's nice.

720
01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:20.367
I'll get you
maybe some water.

721
01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:21.629
Hey!

722
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.762
I know your mama
probably said...

723
01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:27.548
there's no jumping
on the bed.

724
01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:29.768
Well. if there's one bed
in this whole world

725
01:06:29.898 --> 01:06:31.378
that you can jump off.
it's...

726
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.816
it's this one.

727
01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:37.732
You jump on that
with everything
your life's got to give.

728
01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:41.693
-  Okay.
- I don't hear you jumping.

729
01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:44.391
Thank you!

730
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.922
All right.
slow and steady.

731
01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:58.536
- Okay!
- Look. mama!
I caught another one.

732
01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:00.929
Look at that!
Call it beginner's luck!

733
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:04.281
Could've used
this kid as bait!

734
01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.068
You gonna catch
another one
out here?

735
01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:11.027
We're working on it.

736
01:07:11.157 --> 01:07:13.377
-  Trying to.
- What's even out there. huh?

737
01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:15.074
Catfish.

738
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.426
<i>Hey. Mama.</i>

739
01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:22.081
<i>I'm home.</i>

740
01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:29.828
<i>I'm doing somethin' right now
that I think is right.</i>

741
01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:31.395
<i>I'm helpin' someone.</i>

742
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.487
<i>I know you're watching over me.</i>

743
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.491
<i>I'll try and do right by you.</i>

744
01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:45.670
Anyways. I just wanted
to say I love you.

745
01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:51.067
I love you more than anything.

746
01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:59.814
There he is! There's my boy!
You swing. motherfucker!

747
01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:01.251
Swing it!

748
01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:03.775
Swing at those fuckin'
fastballs. Cody!

749
01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:05.864
How many times
I done told you?

750
01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:08.780
How many times
I done told you?

751
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.348
- Huh? You swing--
- Hey! What are you
doing here?

752
01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:15.526
- Hey! How you doin'. Dana?
- You can't be here.

753
01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:17.832
- I can be-- I can watch
my fuckin' boy--
- No. you can't!

754
01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:19.617
- You can't be here...
- Shut the fuck up!

755
01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:21.836
- ...and you know it!
- Get the fuck--
I ain't gonna fuckin'--

756
01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:24.187
- I ain't gonna fuckin'
hurt nobody!
- Don't do this here!

757
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:27.277
-  Please. Larry!
- Hey. get over here. boy.

758
01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:29.931
Hey! You get over here. boy.

759
01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.717
- You don't need
to talk to him. Cody!
- Shut the fuck up!

760
01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:35.502
You shut up!
Don't talk to him. Cody!

761
01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:38.201
What you doin' out there.
boy? You swing
at those fastballs.

762
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:40.028
- You don't take 'em.
- I'm tryin' to play.

763
01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:43.423
Look. I'll come down here.
I'll show you how to play.

764
01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:45.947
- I'll show you how to play.
- I don't need your help.

765
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:50.648
That's not
what it looks like. boy.

766
01:08:50.778 --> 01:08:53.303
Hey... hey!

767
01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:55.870
- Hey!
-  I ain't
talkin' to you!

768
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:57.394
You ain't talkin' to me?

769
01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:00.179
You ain't talkin' to me?!

770
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.748
You ain't talkin' to me?!
You ain't talkin' to me?!

771
01:09:03.878 --> 01:09:05.358
Huh?

772
01:09:05.489 --> 01:09:08.013
I'm your goddamn father.
motherfucker!

773
01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:14.019
What kind of boy don't talk
to his own goddamn father?!

774
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.892
What kind of fuckin' boy don't--
what. motherfucker?

775
01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:20.504
- What? Sit the fuck down!

776
01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:24.160
- You ugly-ass.
sorry-ass motherfuckers.

777
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.817
- Oh. you gon' done
called them again?
-  Yeah. I did.

778
01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:32.820
You stay right the fuck there.

779
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:35.083
- What. you think I was gon'
hit you with this?

780
01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:37.477
- You think I was gon'
hit you with this?
- I fuckin' know it.

781
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.436
- Larry!
- Fuck you. Jay.

782
01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:41.568
Fuck you. Jay.
You don't need
to come down here--

783
01:09:41.699 --> 01:09:44.571
- Come on.
think about that...
- Come on. come on...

784
01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:46.704
- Dammit. Larry!

785
01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.926
I'm your goddamn father!

786
01:09:52.057 --> 01:09:54.451
You're my boy!

787
01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:56.714
Don't fuckin' listen
to her.

788
01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:59.151
- She'll ruin
your fuckin' life. son!
- Come on. enough!

789
01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:01.284
She'll ruin
your fuckin' life!

790
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.684
What are we
doing here?

791
01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:19.867
Try not to look at me
when I tell you this.

792
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:30.226
I was
in an argument one night
'bout my relationship.

793
01:10:33.054 --> 01:10:36.232
<i>Done some wrongs.
beat myself up
pretty bad over it.</i>

794
01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.541
<i>Driving around on back roads.</i>

795
01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:42.803
<i>started drinkin'...</i>

796
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:47.808
<i>Drinkin' a lot.
feelin' pretty good...</i>

797
01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:49.419
<i>Just drivin' the night away.</i>

798
01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:55.207
<i>All of a sudden.
I get turned around.</i>

799
01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.689
<i>Got lost on the way and...</i>

800
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.649
started going pretty fast.

801
01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:10.266
All of a sudden.
I come up over this hill.

802
01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:14.270
There was a truck
right in the middle
of the road.

803
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.662
lights off.

804
01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.210
Hi.

805
01:11:46.693 --> 01:11:48.042
I'm cold.

806
01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:50.741
Let me get you
my jacket.

807
01:11:57.487 --> 01:12:01.099
- Hey! Hey!

808
01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:03.884
- Jason!

809
01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:07.584
I couldn't slam
on the brakes
fast enough.

810
01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:13.111
<i>Next thing I know.
my whole left side's
all crushed up...</i>

811
01:12:13.241 --> 01:12:15.243
- Jason!
- <i>...someone's screaming...</i>

812
01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.810
Jason!

813
01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:19.639
Help! Please help me!

814
01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:22.468
<i>And that's
when I left that truck...</i>

815
01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:25.906
- <i>poor soul that was inside.</i>

816
01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:35.481
Had a feeling you might know
what I'm talking about here.

817
01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.272
Thought you were in jail.

818
01:12:45.491 --> 01:12:48.929
Got out a few days ago.

819
01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:04.031
I hated you.

820
01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:11.474
Oh. my God. I hated you.
I hated you so fuckin' much.

821
01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:16.914
I used to pray
every night...

822
01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:21.005
that somebody
was beatin' you.

823
01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.789
holdin' you down...

824
01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:27.577
I used to pray for hours.

825
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.059
And one day.
I just got tired of it.

826
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:33.974
I got tired of it.
I got tired of...

827
01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:39.327
Got too tired
to hate you...

828
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:40.894
anymore.

829
01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:48.598
But then. I was
a long way from here...

830
01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:50.382
running on fumes.

831
01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:54.952
Trying to save
my own life...

832
01:13:57.824 --> 01:13:59.304
save Analee's...

833
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:03.613
And you...

834
01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.005
you...

835
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:08.356
didn't matter.

836
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.316
At all.

837
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:14.972
How old is Analee. Maben?

838
01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:18.671
How old
do you think she is?

839
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:23.197
Maben. I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

840
01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:26.940
I swear to God.
I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

841
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.992
Larry and Walt know?
They know about her?

842
01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:39.170
Don't see
how they would.

843
01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:46.786
- Goddamn. I'm sorry.
- No. don't...

844
01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:52.009
I didn't get to tell you then.
so I'm sayin' it now that I'm--

845
01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:54.751
- I'm sorry.
- No!

846
01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:57.014
- I'm sayin' I'm sorry--
- No. you don't get
to apologize

847
01:14:57.144 --> 01:14:58.842
'cause it don't change nothing.

848
01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:01.235
It might make you feel
better. but it don't
change nothing.

849
01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:02.628
It don't make me feel
any better--

850
01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:05.196
Do not fuckin'
say it again!

851
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.336
We gotta throw this.

852
01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:18.165
You think
you can pay for that
with a splash?

853
01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:20.516
I already paid for it.

854
01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:24.345
The only person I owe
is that boy

855
01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:26.609
and I'll be paying
for that soon enough.

856
01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:32.397
Shit. I believe
everything you say.

857
01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.965
And I'm glad
you shot that asshole.

858
01:15:35.095 --> 01:15:37.533
I don't know
who he was. but...

859
01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:40.361
I can see him in my mind.
Shit. I...

860
01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:42.407
Been many times
I wished I had a gun

861
01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.975
to shoot whoever
had a hold on me.

862
01:15:45.105 --> 01:15:47.543
Been many times
God heard your prayers

863
01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:49.153
and He...

864
01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:53.374
He damn sure answered to you.
be sure He's up there.

865
01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.376
He heard me that time.

866
01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:57.770
Not no other time.

867
01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:00.730
Let me ask you...

868
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.386
Why weren't you
in the truck?

869
01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:28.758
I guess so...

870
01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.937
so we can be
standing here...

871
01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:37.201
right now.

872
01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:44.425
Well. I'll tell you
one thing...

873
01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:49.387
They're gonna have to kill me
before I go back to prison.

874
01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:51.607
I know
you already killed once

875
01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.521
when the world
had you by the throat...

876
01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:58.048
I'll do the same damn thing
before I go back.

877
01:16:59.789 --> 01:17:01.225
You hear me?

878
01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:05.533
Wait. um... wait.

879
01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:11.017
I'll do it.

880
01:17:15.805 --> 01:17:17.241
Wipe it down.

881
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.767
What are you
doing here. bud?

882
01:18:04.897 --> 01:18:07.204
You know me.
Waitin'.

883
01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:10.860
- Where you been?
- Out at Mitchell's.

884
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.167
Tell you
I came out there
lookin' for you?

885
01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:17.954
- Well... found me.
- I have now.

886
01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:21.566
You know I've been huntin'
for you for a couple
of days. right?

887
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.525
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

888
01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:26.658
We got
a dead cop. Russ.

889
01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:29.748
Between you and me.
you're the only person
to be seen anywhere near him.

890
01:18:29.879 --> 01:18:32.446
Now. that don't mean nothing
other than we need
to talk to you.

891
01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:35.188
but then when I come
lookin' for you. it takes me
two days to find you.

892
01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:37.800
- So what?
- So where you been at?

893
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:40.367
Comin' over here
early in the morning.
late at night.

894
01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:42.152
Mitchell don't know.

895
01:18:42.282 --> 01:18:44.197
You need to stop
going out there.

896
01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:46.243
Then tell me what's going on.
because your name
is not the only name

897
01:18:46.373 --> 01:18:48.245
that's been comin'
across my desk.

898
01:18:50.508 --> 01:18:51.639
What's that?

899
01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:54.642
You don't remember Maben?

900
01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:56.688
Why should I?

901
01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:59.038
Because it's the name
of that gal

902
01:18:59.169 --> 01:19:01.040
that was with Jason
the night that he died.

903
01:19:01.171 --> 01:19:04.217
Figured a name like that
tied to a night like that.
it might stick.

904
01:19:04.348 --> 01:19:06.742
I tried to forget all that.
Why are you showing me this?

905
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:14.314
A woman named Maben came
into the shelter downtown
with a little girl.

906
01:19:14.445 --> 01:19:16.577
The lady working there said
she found a pistol on her

907
01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.231
before she took off running.

908
01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:19.798
Now I know the last name
is made up.

909
01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.801
but it's really hard
to make up a name like Maben.

910
01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:25.717
Tell me
where you've been at.

911
01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:28.154
Look. you probably
just missed me.

912
01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:30.504
Been out at Mitchell's.

913
01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:33.594
Larry's come by here.
busted out all my goddamn
windows and doors.

914
01:19:33.725 --> 01:19:36.467
I ain't just gonna sit
around here waitin'
for his ass to show up.

915
01:19:40.253 --> 01:19:41.689
Okay.

916
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.604
You don't mind if I ask
Mitchell. do you?

917
01:19:43.735 --> 01:19:45.998
I just wanna clear your name.
so the department lays off me.

918
01:19:46.129 --> 01:19:48.566
Of course. go ahead.
Just call 'im first.

919
01:19:48.696 --> 01:19:51.134
Don't just go
showing up out there.

920
01:19:51.264 --> 01:19:53.484
Feel like enough burden
as it is.

921
01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:55.355
All right. I hear you.
I hear you.

922
01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:57.314
You know I hate
asking you these things. right?

923
01:19:57.444 --> 01:19:59.446
Yeah. whatever
you say. bud.

924
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.145
Love you.

925
01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:06.105
I'll pay you back
for that bail.

926
01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:08.064
That's what you said
last time.

927
01:20:08.194 --> 01:20:10.501
- Hey. come here.
- What? What?!

928
01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:15.811
- Dude. what happened. man?
- It don't matter.

929
01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:18.770
- No. it... it does.
- What's the matter. motherfucker?

930
01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.339
I'm worried about you.

931
01:20:24.123 --> 01:20:27.344
Look. it's j--
it's just us. man.

932
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.476
We're all that's left.
do you hear me?

933
01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.524
It don't--
It ain't gon'
bring him back.

934
01:20:33.654 --> 01:20:36.353
You gotta let him go. Larry.
It ain't gonna bring him back.

935
01:20:36.483 --> 01:20:38.398
You fuckin' one of them now.
You're one of them now.

936
01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:40.661
Don't say that shit. man.

937
01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:42.185
- Fuck you. man.
- Come on. man.

938
01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:44.187
- Don't say that shit. dude.

939
01:20:44.317 --> 01:20:46.754
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Hey. you gotta calm down!

940
01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:48.582
You never had my back.
motherfucker!

941
01:20:48.713 --> 01:20:50.236
Get the fuck out of here!

942
01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:52.717
Come on. man!

943
01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.633
- Pussy-ass motherfucker.
- Get back over here. man.

944
01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:58.854
Talk to me!
I'm your brother!

945
01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:00.507
Fuckin' all there is

946
01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:03.859
- is out here.

947
01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:06.209
Just out here.

948
01:21:20.658 --> 01:21:22.312

949
01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:26.751
Jason on second.
Walt's on third.

950
01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:30.146
What's he do--
he's callin' it!

951
01:21:30.276 --> 01:21:31.843
He's callin' it. y'all.

952
01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:34.367
Swings...

953
01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:37.066
- Fly fuckin' ball!

954
01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:39.459
It's out of here!

955
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:43.333
He's callin' it. playing
to the fuckin' crowd.

956
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.077
He's making his way.

957
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.048
He's making...

958
01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.702
- Hey! <i>Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³?</i>
- Oh. shit. lady!

959
01:24:58.832 --> 01:25:00.486
- I was just looking
for Mitchell.
- <i>PÃ¡rele.</i>

960
01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:02.140
- <i>Usted no puede estar acÃ¡.</i>
- Okay. Relax.

961
01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:03.620
- Relax!
- <i>VÃ¡yase. Fuera de acÃ¡ ya.</i>

962
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.535
Settle down. okay?
Settle down.
I'm leaving.

963
01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:09.408
- <i>Voy a llamar a la policÃ­a.</i>
- I am the damn police.

964
01:25:09.539 --> 01:25:10.714
How you doin'. Boyd?

965
01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.281
I mean. I wasn't
plannin' on sellin'.

966
01:25:12.411 --> 01:25:14.935
but. uh. feel free
to have a look around.

967
01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:17.242
Knocked
on the front door first.
Didn't hear anything.

968
01:25:17.373 --> 01:25:19.462
Thought I heard you out back.
so I went looking for you.

969
01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:23.205
Well. you were
on the ball. Deputy.
Everything all right?

970
01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:24.902
I just need to know

971
01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.599
if Russell stayed here
with you the night
before last.

972
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.514
- Yeah. he did.
- All night?

973
01:25:28.645 --> 01:25:31.169
Well. I didn't set up
all night watching him
snore or nothing.

974
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.171
but. uh. as far as I know.
he was here.

975
01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:35.086
Okay. good. Anyone else
can attest to that?

976
01:25:35.217 --> 01:25:37.132
Well. um.
you musta seen 'im.

977
01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:38.829
Yes. I can.

978
01:25:38.959 --> 01:25:42.093
You speak English. Okay.

979
01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:44.139
Yeah. she'll do that... sometimes.

980
01:25:45.923 --> 01:25:48.055
All right.
Thank you.

981
01:25:50.101 --> 01:25:52.059
Have a nice day. Deputy.

982
01:26:07.031 --> 01:26:09.642
-  Shit.

983
01:26:18.695 --> 01:26:20.653
You're lyin' to me
about where you've been.

984
01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:21.959
Your whole family is!

985
01:26:22.089 --> 01:26:23.700
What I can't
understand is why.

986
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.313
It don't matter what I say.
You got some big idea.

987
01:26:28.444 --> 01:26:31.534
Call it a big idea.
call it whatever you want.

988
01:26:31.664 --> 01:26:34.014
I'm here so you can talk
to me. man. Me!

989
01:26:34.145 --> 01:26:35.277
Without talking
to nobody else.

990
01:26:35.407 --> 01:26:37.061
but you're not making it
easy on me.

991
01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.454
Now when I get
to that office.

992
01:26:38.584 --> 01:26:40.195
I'm gonna tell
about not being able
to find you

993
01:26:40.325 --> 01:26:42.414
and about this woman
named Maben. who has
a pistol on her.

994
01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:44.068
because you're leaving me
no damn choice.

995
01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.939
Just because
you didn't see me
lay down in bed

996
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:47.506
don't mean
I didn't sleep in it.

997
01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:49.639
Russell. there's ways
of getting to whatever it is

998
01:26:49.769 --> 01:26:51.162
you seem to be
dancing around. man.

999
01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.250
Talk to me!

1000
01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:53.817
Then put the cuffs on me.

1001
01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:55.949
Or get the hell out of here.

1002
01:26:58.604 --> 01:27:00.519
Not until you answer me
like I want.

1003
01:27:02.782 --> 01:27:04.088
All right.

1004
01:27:06.612 --> 01:27:09.136
You don't wanna leave?
I will.

1005
01:27:12.836 --> 01:27:15.447
Wanna arrest me?
Arrest me.

1006
01:27:19.799 --> 01:27:21.801
Get the hell out
of my damn house.

1007
01:27:33.204 --> 01:27:34.292
Where's Mitchell?

1008
01:27:34.423 --> 01:27:35.554
Yeah. you and me
got to talk.

1009
01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:37.034
Boyd was back here
snoopin' around--

1010
01:27:37.164 --> 01:27:38.470
He see Maben or Analee?

1011
01:27:38.601 --> 01:27:41.647
-  Very close.
- What did you call her?

1012
01:27:43.475 --> 01:27:45.172
You heard me.

1013
01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:54.225
<i>You're gonna have to go.</i>

1014
01:27:54.356 --> 01:27:56.358
We're not talking
about forever here. Maben.

1015
01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:58.882
- We're talking about
a couple of weeks. okay?
- Yeah.

1016
01:28:01.319 --> 01:28:04.104
Yeah.

1017
01:28:04.235 --> 01:28:05.541
Just a--

1018
01:28:05.671 --> 01:28:07.151
Just a couple of weeks.

1019
01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.284
Hey. I don't see
any other way around it.

1020
01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:13.897
Been livin' that way
for a while.

1021
01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:29.913
We'll just sit out here.

1022
01:28:31.697 --> 01:28:33.308
Let the sun go down.

1023
01:28:34.918 --> 01:28:36.615
I bought you a bus ticket.

1024
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:42.012
There's one heading out
late tonight.

1025
01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:45.581
It'll take you to Memphis.
you just get off
wherever you feel.

1026
01:28:45.711 --> 01:28:48.758
I got you money too.
it's just all over
at the house.

1027
01:28:48.888 --> 01:28:51.674
No. I don't need
your money.

1028
01:28:51.804 --> 01:28:53.458
I know you don't.

1029
01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:56.809
I don't need you
to give me nothin'.

1030
01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:59.029
I know I don't have to.

1031
01:29:00.465 --> 01:29:02.467
Seems like you and I...

1032
01:29:04.774 --> 01:29:07.777
we're tied together
by some sort
of invisible rope.

1033
01:29:07.907 --> 01:29:09.779
and it's always been there.

1034
01:29:09.909 --> 01:29:11.911
It ain't lettin' us go.

1035
01:29:16.046 --> 01:29:19.223
That girl's gonna be
damn fine sittin' here.

1036
01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.399
You gotta get out of here.
you gotta be safe.

1037
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:25.098
You gotta be safe for you.
you gotta be safe for her.

1038
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:26.970
And I promise you

1039
01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.712
I ain't gonna let
a damn thing happen to her.

1040
01:29:32.236 --> 01:29:34.456
- I promise you.

1041
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:37.763
I promise you.

1042
01:30:00.525 --> 01:30:02.179
Just a little bruise.

1043
01:30:21.546 --> 01:30:22.721
Pull it.

1044
01:30:22.852 --> 01:30:25.332
Come on. motherfucker.

1045
01:30:45.396 --> 01:30:47.616
You fuckin' pussy.

1046
01:30:53.012 --> 01:30:54.361
Ah...

1047
01:30:57.408 --> 01:30:59.062
It's gonna hurt.

1048
01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:03.153
It's gonna fuckin' hurt.

1049
01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:11.378
We'll take
good care of her.
don't you worry.

1050
01:31:11.509 --> 01:31:13.772
You wanna wake up Analee.

1051
01:31:13.903 --> 01:31:16.122
say goodbye to her
before we take off?

1052
01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:22.651
I fuckin' told her
I'd never leave her

1053
01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:24.479
and here I go.
leaving her.

1054
01:31:27.307 --> 01:31:29.309
Every single fuckin' thing
I've done wrong.

1055
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.487
I've brought down
on that little girl.

1056
01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:35.141
Hey. life's a whirlwind.
We're all caught up in it.

1057
01:31:35.272 --> 01:31:36.882
You're a good mama.

1058
01:31:37.013 --> 01:31:39.319
Hell. anyone can see how much
you love that little girl.

1059
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.017
you love her so bad.
it hurts.

1060
01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:43.889
And if it didn't hurt.
you wouldn't be
doing it right.

1061
01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.501
That hurt never goes away.
it doesn't matter
how old they get.

1062
01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:52.202
Just do the best you can
for right now.

1063
01:31:52.332 --> 01:31:54.509
and you don't worry
about tomorrow
until it comes.

1064
01:31:59.339 --> 01:32:00.558
You're doing
the right thing.

1065
01:32:08.044 --> 01:32:10.176
- Take care of her.
- Oh. yeah.

1066
01:32:12.396 --> 01:32:13.571
Ahem.

1067
01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.434
Coast's clear.

1068
01:33:36.001 --> 01:33:37.524
I've got everything
ready here.

1069
01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:39.657
Got you a bunch of supplies.

1070
01:33:39.788 --> 01:33:41.485
Can I use your bathroom?

1071
01:33:41.616 --> 01:33:42.965
Sure. down the hall.

1072
01:33:48.535 --> 01:33:49.493
Maben!

1073
01:34:03.246 --> 01:34:05.683
- That's all you've got?
-  Yeah!

1074
01:34:09.208 --> 01:34:10.514
Motherfucker!

1075
01:34:20.089 --> 01:34:24.093
You killed the wrong one.
You ain't fucking perfect.

1076
01:34:24.223 --> 01:34:26.269
You should've killed me.

1077
01:34:34.277 --> 01:34:35.670
It's over now. boy.

1078
01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:49.596
I've been waitin'
seven fuckin' years
for this.

1079
01:34:57.039 --> 01:35:00.129
- You okay. son?

1080
01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:01.826
Dammit. Larry.
I'm sorry.

1081
01:35:01.957 --> 01:35:04.133
Why don't you sit down. son?
I'll call you an ambulance.

1082
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.318
Maben!

1083
01:35:15.448 --> 01:35:17.668
Maben!

1084
01:35:19.365 --> 01:35:20.671
Goddammit. Mitchell!

1085
01:35:20.802 --> 01:35:22.412
I told you to stay
the hell out of this shit.

1086
01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:24.414
- You can damn me later.

1087
01:35:24.544 --> 01:35:26.024
We gotta get her
the hell outta here.

1088
01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:29.767
Damn. I knew
he'd do something wrong.

1089
01:35:33.162 --> 01:35:34.163
Careful there.

1090
01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:37.253
Be safe. son.

1091
01:35:37.383 --> 01:35:38.820
Get home!

1092
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:41.083
- Get rid
of that fuckin' gun!
- Yeah. yeah.

1093
01:36:08.937 --> 01:36:10.155
Come here. boy.

1094
01:36:11.853 --> 01:36:13.158
Cody...

1095
01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:16.771
Cody. boy...

1096
01:36:19.425 --> 01:36:20.600
Cody...

1097
01:36:20.731 --> 01:36:24.430
Cody!

1098
01:36:27.999 --> 01:36:29.696
Jesus Christ. Larry...

1099
01:36:31.002 --> 01:36:33.091
- Where is my son?
- What happened to you?

1100
01:36:33.222 --> 01:36:35.006
- Who did this to you?
- Where is he?

1101
01:36:35.137 --> 01:36:36.878
- Larry...
- Mom. what the fuck's
going on?

1102
01:36:37.008 --> 01:36:38.444
- Go call 911!
- Why is he here?

1103
01:36:38.575 --> 01:36:39.881
- Dad. why the fuck
are you here?
- Call 911!

1104
01:36:40.011 --> 01:36:42.579
- Why? What's going on?

1105
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:45.538
- Is he fuckin' bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?
- Go call 911. Cody!

1106
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:47.584
- He needs help!
- Go call!

1107
01:36:47.714 --> 01:36:50.892
Come here. boy...
Let me touch my son.

1108
01:36:51.022 --> 01:36:53.198
Larry.
don't move. please. Okay?

1109
01:36:53.329 --> 01:36:55.374
- Try not to move. Larry--
- Get the fuck away from me.

1110
01:36:55.505 --> 01:36:57.463
- Goddammit.
Hey. listen.

1111
01:36:57.594 --> 01:37:00.075
Stay right there.
okay? Don't move!

1112
01:37:00.205 --> 01:37:04.427
- Imma get you help...
- You all did this to me.

1113
01:37:04.557 --> 01:37:07.822
You all did it.
You all did it.

1114
01:37:21.139 --> 01:37:23.446
-  Hey. you can't go!
-  Dad.
what are you doing?

1115
01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:24.839
Dad. stop!
Where are you going?

1116
01:37:24.969 --> 01:37:27.754
You can't drive like that.
Larry! Come on!

1117
01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:31.106
Oh. shit. he's driving!
He's driving!

1118
01:37:31.236 --> 01:37:33.630
Please hurry!

1119
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.936
Help!

1120
01:37:36.241 --> 01:37:37.721
Somebody help!

1121
01:37:43.031 --> 01:37:45.033
Somebody help us!

1122
01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.474
Maben... we're here.

1123
01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:54.172
-  What happened?
- She-- she fell. She...

1124
01:37:54.303 --> 01:37:55.957
hit her head.
Her head flipped back.

1125
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:47.182
I heard your address
on the wire. Shots fired?

1126
01:38:48.748 --> 01:38:50.272
Hell yeah.
shots fired.

1127
01:38:50.402 --> 01:38:51.621
What the hell happened?

1128
01:38:55.103 --> 01:38:58.628
Walked in my place.
Larry was there.

1129
01:38:58.758 --> 01:39:00.369
Had a woman with me.

1130
01:39:00.499 --> 01:39:03.198
he hit her over the head
with a crowbar thinkin'
it was me.

1131
01:39:03.328 --> 01:39:04.503
Him and I got into it.

1132
01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:07.419
I got ahold of my rifle
and I shot 'im.

1133
01:39:09.117 --> 01:39:10.335
Who is she. Russ?

1134
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:14.470
You know goddamn well
who she is.

1135
01:39:20.302 --> 01:39:22.608
Russ. you gotta tell me.

1136
01:39:22.739 --> 01:39:25.089
What the hell you got
to do with all this?

1137
01:39:28.788 --> 01:39:30.790
I'll explain
everything to you.

1138
01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:35.012
You gotta promise me
you ain't gonna listen to me
like a lawman.

1139
01:39:35.143 --> 01:39:36.666
What do you want me
to listen to you like?

1140
01:39:36.796 --> 01:39:38.755
I want you to listen to me
like you're you...

1141
01:39:40.365 --> 01:39:41.627
and I'm me.

1142
01:39:47.764 --> 01:39:49.418
Okay. Okay.

1143
01:39:59.602 --> 01:40:01.996
<i>The pistol
you're looking for
is over in the lake.</i>

1144
01:40:02.126 --> 01:40:03.998
<i>Same one Maben held on me</i>

1145
01:40:04.128 --> 01:40:07.218
<i>when I walked out
of the Armadillo
a few nights ago.</i>

1146
01:40:07.349 --> 01:40:11.309
<i>That's when she got to talkin'
about how some deputy</i>

1147
01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.225
<i>made her do everything
that he wanted her to do.</i>

1148
01:40:14.356 --> 01:40:16.227
<i>even called
his goddamned friends along</i>

1149
01:40:16.358 --> 01:40:18.360
<i>to come have a go at her too.</i>

1150
01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:21.145
Next thing she knew.
he was down. dead.
and she kept on runnin'.

1151
01:40:21.276 --> 01:40:23.234
kept on runnin' straight
until she ran into me.

1152
01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.630
Why the hell didn't you
and her just both
come straight to me?

1153
01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:32.374
Nobody would've believed her
and you know it. Boyd.

1154
01:40:35.551 --> 01:40:37.205
She'da lost the kid.

1155
01:40:37.335 --> 01:40:40.295
And I'll be goddamned.
but I believe
everything she says.

1156
01:40:42.862 --> 01:40:44.516
My road's the road
that brought us all here.

1157
01:40:44.647 --> 01:40:46.692
led by what hand.
I don't know.

1158
01:40:46.823 --> 01:40:49.826
But here we are.
and I ain't lettin' this go.

1159
01:40:49.956 --> 01:40:51.871
Shit. I'm only telling you
all this so you know

1160
01:40:52.002 --> 01:40:54.091
when I ask you
just leave her alone.

1161
01:40:54.222 --> 01:40:56.050
I ain't tellin' you.
I'm askin' you.

1162
01:40:58.791 --> 01:41:00.315
Just let it fall.

1163
01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.969
Let it fall?

1164
01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:07.191
Just let it fall.

1165
01:41:07.322 --> 01:41:09.715
Do you know
who's at my house
right now?

1166
01:41:12.327 --> 01:41:14.329
Yes. I do.

1167
01:41:14.459 --> 01:41:16.853
And do you know what the boys
at Parchman would do
to a sheriff's deputy?

1168
01:41:16.983 --> 01:41:19.247
Huh? It'd make your time
look like summer camp.

1169
01:41:27.907 --> 01:41:29.909
Where's the proof.
Russell?

1170
01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:14.519
What does that
look like to you?

1171
01:43:16.015 --> 01:43:19.280
<i>The days are slow.</i>

1172
01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:21.891
<i>They get that way
when you're waiting
on something to happen</i>

1173
01:43:22.021 --> 01:43:23.632
<i>that you hope never will.</i>

1174
01:43:28.767 --> 01:43:31.335
<i>You can't help but wonder
if today is the day...</i>

1175
01:43:33.381 --> 01:43:35.513
<i>they'll be sittin' there.</i>

1176
01:43:35.644 --> 01:43:38.473
<i>then here they come.
over that hill.</i>

1177
01:43:38.603 --> 01:43:42.825
<i>down the driveway.
lights flashing.</i>

1178
01:43:42.955 --> 01:43:44.957
<i>sirens calling out your name.</i>

1179
01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:49.048
<i>Russell told me
about this dream</i>

1180
01:43:49.179 --> 01:43:52.269
<i>of being back on the inside.</i>

1181
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.445
<i>about how the light
was always grey.</i>

1182
01:43:56.055 --> 01:43:58.406
<i>and there was always
this voice calling out...</i>

1183
01:44:00.843 --> 01:44:02.453
<i>Just some cry.</i>

1184
01:44:02.584 --> 01:44:04.586
<i>echoing through
an empty prison...</i>

1185
01:44:07.632 --> 01:44:09.808
<i>and he never knew
what he was supposed to do.</i>

1186
01:44:11.767 --> 01:44:14.204
<i>If he was supposed
to be helping it. or...</i>

1187
01:44:15.684 --> 01:44:17.381
<i>if it was there to help him.</i>

1188
01:44:25.911 --> 01:44:28.000
<i>Sometimes I think it was me
he was hearing...</i>

1189
01:44:39.577 --> 01:44:42.276
<i>I don't guess there's no way
of knowing what's coming.</i>

1190
01:44:46.105 --> 01:44:49.108
<i>Never has been.
Never will be.</i>

1191
01:44:52.242 --> 01:44:53.504
<i>But. for once.</i>

1192
01:44:54.984 --> 01:44:56.202
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

1193
01:45:28.147 --> 01:45:30.149
<i>And when the daylight fades.</i>

1194
01:45:32.238 --> 01:45:34.632
<i>and it seems okay
to breathe a little...</i>

1195
01:45:39.158 --> 01:45:40.725
<i>that low light</i>

1196
01:45:41.726 --> 01:45:44.207
<i>gives her this long shadow.</i>

1197
01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:46.340
<i>like her arms are spread out.</i>

1198
01:45:48.516 --> 01:45:50.213
<i>As if she's saying.</i>

1199
01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:53.172
<i>"Come here
and let me hold you..."</i>

1200
01:45:57.307 --> 01:45:58.743
<i>I don't know...</i>

1201
01:45:58.874 --> 01:46:01.790
- Get-- get up! Get up!
Here. stand up.

1202
01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.706
<i>Maybe there is
such a thing as a miracle.</i>

1203
01:46:04.836 --> 01:46:06.708
I got you.

1204
01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:20.156
<i>All I know for certain...</i>

1205
01:46:23.855 --> 01:46:25.291
<i>she's mine.</i>
