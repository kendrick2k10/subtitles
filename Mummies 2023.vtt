A long time ago...

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.282
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

5
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.199
Hyah! Hyah!

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.142
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.488
<i> Egypt. A land of mystery.
intrigue and rich history.</i>

8
00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.359
<i> Today I. the world-renowned
archeologist.</i>

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.427
<i> Lord Sylvester Carnaby.</i>

10
00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.563
<i> present to you...</i>

11
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.664
<i> Hold on.</i>

12
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.432
-Mummy. I'm--
-<i> Sylvester!</i>

13
00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.734
-I can't talk.
-<i> Where have you been?</i>

14
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.569
<i> I haven't heard
a peep from you.</i>

15
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.005
Listen. I can't talk right now.
I have a date with--

16
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.373
<i> A date? Oh. my God.</i>

17
00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.974
-No. a date with history!
-<i> At last!</i>

18
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.110
<i> I bet she's pretty.</i>

19
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.278
Oh. I'm losing you--

20
00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:30.783
Oh. terrible signal...

21
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.852
<i> On the other side
of this door.</i>

22
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.556
<i> lies the tomb
of Princess Nefer.</i>

23
00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.955
No. it can't be.

24
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.356
Wow!

25
00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.258
"Wow"?

26
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.360
It's empty!

27
00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:16.162
The Mummy isn't here.

28
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.396
-Let me see!
-No!

29
00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.630
-Get back.
-I got next!

30
00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:21.634
-You're always like this.
-No. you!

31
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.002
You and your grasping arms...

32
00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.137
-What's this? Look.
-Stop it!

33
00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.238
-Look at this.
-Ha-hah!

34
00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:27.540
Oh! Lord Carnaby.

35
00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.976
It seems to speak of...

36
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.512
-Hello?
-A bridge...

37
00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.117
From the world of the living
to the afterlife.

38
00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:41.354
A doorway of sorts to...
a city!

39
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.156
A city where the mummies reside
in the afterlife.

40
00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:48.394
A world of mummies...
under the earth.

41
00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:52.064
What...

42
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.967
You two. Get the equipment.

43
00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:58.905
Oh!

44
00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:02.675
I've found something!

45
00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:04.944
Huh?

46
00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:02.035
MUMMIES

47
00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:22.588
THUT SIGNING SESSION

48
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.263
With love...
Thut the Charioteer.

49
00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:35.835
Can I?

50
00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:44.910
Why did you stop racing?
You're so young.

51
00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.813
Oh. you know. I just want
to give others a chance to win.

52
00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.849
Why haven't you found
that special girl

53
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.185
to settle down with? Hmm?

54
00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:57.490
Well. marriage is forever
and us mummies live forever.

55
00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:00.193
so I think... not for me.

56
00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.662
-You rock!
-Whoo-hoo!

57
00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.065
-Hey. Thut!
-We love you. Thut!

58
00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:18.644
What you doing. little brother?

59
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.616
Thut's big return!

60
00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:26.919
You saw all the fans you
still have at the papyrus shop.

61
00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:36.496
No! I can't.

62
00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.797
Yes. you can. You're the champ!

63
00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:41.801
I was the champ. Not anymore.

64
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.904
I can't go back.

65
00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.775
Just go home. Sekhem.
I'll get us some food.

66
00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:57.683
Oh! There you go. my friend.

67
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.685
-See you next week.
-Yeah. see you next week.

68
00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.055
Huh?

69
00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:09.895
-Stop. madam!
-Oh!

70
00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.130
Oh!

71
00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.537
Oh. you're very kind.

72
00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:21.240
My basket!

73
00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:22.575
No worries! I got it.

74
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.886
Don't you know to look first.
before crossing the street?

75
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.587
Don't you see people crossing?

76
00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:36.989
You had to stop! I was first.

77
00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.560
I was the one crossing first!
You had to stop.

78
00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:43.596
Next time. look first!

79
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:49.935
Hyah!

80
00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.471
Mm?

81
00:07:57.142 --> 00:07:59.478
Here we are.
Don't forget your basket.

82
00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:02.548
Oh. thank you very much.

83
00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.945

Oh. Ra be merciful!

103
00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:47.820
Usi. this place hasn't changed
in thousands of years.

104
00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:49.521
We need change.

105
00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:53.425
What would your father
say if he hears you singing?

106
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:54.760
You will soon be named

107
00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:56.695
the official successor
of the Pharaoh.

108
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:00.632
Singing is for entertainers.
not for the rulers
of our world.

109
00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:03.803
-Shh! You can't tell him!
-Mm...

110
00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.472
All right.

111
00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:10.075
Oh. thank you. thank you.
thank you!

112
00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:13.411
Suspicious of what?

113
00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:15.814
Dad! Of. um... Well. uh...

114
00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:18.650
Her new suitor.

115
00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.385
My... new suitor?

116
00:10:20.452 --> 00:10:21.721
Mm. Did you forget?

117
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.756
Um...

118
00:10:24.823 --> 00:10:27.526
Today. my daughter.
the Phoenix Bird.

119
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.962
guided by Hathor.
the Goddess of Love.

120
00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:32.398
will choose
your future husband.

121
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.270
That was not in my schedule.
Where is my schedule. please?

122
00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:41.574
Dad! Sorry. sorry. I mean.
Great Pharaoh.

123
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.943
I need at least
a hundred more years

124
00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:45.510
before I get engaged!

125
00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:47.746
What if--
What if I don't like him?

126
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:55.788
What if we don't get along?
What if--

127
00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:59.658
You know what?
I don't want to get married!

128
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:06.231
It isn't just any bird!
It's a Phoenix Bird.

129
00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.934
Sent by the Goddess
of Love herself!

130
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.137
Dad. come on.

131
00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.739
The two thousands
are the new one thousands.

132
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.307
So. I'm still pretty young.

133
00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:18.177
I have other priorities
in my life.

134
00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:19.177
Priorities?

135
00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:21.880
Being a princess.
that is your duty!

136
00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.816
And that includes marriage.

137
00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.520
I know you are nervous.
but you will see.

138
00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:32.825
the Goddess has
someone handsome
and exciting in mind for you.

139
00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.569
The Goddess Hathor

140
00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:49.041
shall guide
the majestic Phoenix
through our kingdom.

141
00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:54.180
Let us open the Stargate
for the Phoenix!

142
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.109
Aww!

143
00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.577
Oh! Uh...

144
00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.646
Sorry. Wrong recipe.

145
00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:42.861
Now. glorious Phoenix!

146
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.097
Take flight!

147
00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:49.101
We await your destiny.

148
00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:04.216
-Watch out!
-Hey!

149
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.793
The Great Sekhem.
the undefeated boomer...

150
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.194
Uh...

151
00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:19.731
Boomerang. uh...
boomerang guy!

152
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:23.669
Mm...

153
00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:29.241
Huh?

154
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.943
Oh. false alarm.

155
00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:41.020
Oh. no.

156
00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:46.257
-The Phoenix bird has chosen!
-Are you sure?

157
00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:50.062
It swooped down
towards a house.

158
00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.901
Ow!

159
00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:00.539
Huh!

160
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.142
Hmm...

161
00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:08.547
Sorry. signing was
from five to seven.

162
00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.887
Do you... Do you know who I am?

163
00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:17.923
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to myself here?

164
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.726
Could you please put me down?

165
00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:23.528
What is it the--

166
00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:26.031
but could somebody
please tell me--

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.535
Rise. young man.

I know you.

169
00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.841
Ex-charioteer. Your Majesty.

170
00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:38.277
An ex-charioteer?

171
00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.279
I have to marry a guy
whose only talent

172
00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:43.482
is riding around in a circle?

173
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:48.787
Young Thut.

174
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.692
Thanks. Cheers. Thank you.

175

Sorry. This is crazy.

180
00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.177
This is a lot.

181
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.778
I mean. so many things
to consider.

182
00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:15.079
Like. are we compatible?

183
00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:16.815
And that I'm allergic
to marriage.

184
00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.585
Diagnosed. in fact.
Ah-choo! Ah-choo!

185
00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.119
He's right. Dad. he's right!

186
00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:24.289
Sorry. I mean. um.
Great Pharaoh.

187
00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:26.825
If you go against
the Goddess' wishes.

188
00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:29.628
they will cut out your tongue
and pluck out your eyes.

189
00:15:29.694 --> 00:15:33.565
Both eyes?

190
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.435
Oh. who doesn't love marriage?

191
00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:39.204
Nefer. I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you!

192
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.607
Where were we
honeymooning again?

193
00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:44.309
Could you do the pluck out
of the eyes to me

194
00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:46.745
so that I don't
have to see this?

195
00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:50.582
Enough!

196
00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.720
It is now your duty
to safeguard this ring

197
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:58.357
until the day of the wedding.
If anything happens to it...

198
00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:03.128
Eyes and tongue
punishment thing.

199
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.865
Destiny has been written.

200
00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:09.067
Let us leave
the bride and groom

201
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.236
to get to know each other.

202
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.083
What did you say
your name was?

203
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.419
Uh. Thut the Charioteer.

204
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.721
Whatever. Let's just get
something straight. okay?

205
00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.856
Don't go getting
emotionally involved because--

206
00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:35.861
Hey. stop. Princess.
Honestly. you're not my type.

207
00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.595
Oh. what a relief.

208
00:16:37.662 --> 00:16:39.097
Because I wouldn't
go out with you

209
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.400
if you were the last mummy
on earth.

210
00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.701
So thanks for saving me
the trouble.

211
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.408
Well. you make an eternity
feel like... uh. an eternity.

212
00:16:49.474 --> 00:16:51.342
Why am I even wasting my time
talking to you?

213
00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:53.645
The woman who needs
a deranged pigeon

214
00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:55.080
to find her a husband.

215
00:16:56.381 --> 00:16:58.383
Oh. it is not a pigeon.

216
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.886
It's a Phoenix bird!

217
00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:03.756
Sent by the Goddess
of Love herself!

218
00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.626
Oh. You... you smile.

219
00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:12.297
there has been some kind
of mistake. Oh!

220
00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:16.568
Mm.

221
00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:17.969
He... can be.

222
00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.005
Look. why don't you
just back out?

223
00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:22.373
They'd only scoop out your eyes
and cut out your tongue.

224
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.776
and then you'd talk less!
So. win-win.

225
00:17:24.842 --> 00:17:26.645
Ah. this is getting dark.

226
00:17:31.249 --> 00:17:34.218
Oh. you're right! Usi!

227
00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.356
Y-yes?

228
00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:40.959
Operator. it should be
night time.

229
00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.560
Eh?

230
00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:44.396
Quickly. quickly!

231
00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.199
Night!

232
00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:31.877
Shooting star. please.

233
00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:39.250
I think I could
get used to this.

234
00:18:39.317 --> 00:18:41.487
Well. you won't have to. So...

235
00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:46.625
Thanks for coming by. though.
A shame you have to go.

236
00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.828
So. I'll...
see you at the wedding?

237
00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:53.297
Oh. I can't wait.

238
00:18:53.364 --> 00:18:54.700
Uh. well. neither can I.

239
00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:57.903
Oh. yeah? Well. I really
can't wait to marry you.

240
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.539
I'm just so excited
to marry a charioteer!

241
00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:03.975
Oh. yeah?
Well. I can't wait
to marry you

242
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:07.679
and love you forever
and cherish you
for all eternity!

243
00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.080
-Fine!
-Fine!

244
00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.753
The shooting star
was a bit much.
don't you think?

245
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.989
Oh. he seemed nice.

246
00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.825
Nice? Please...

247
00:19:20.892 --> 00:19:22.227
Mm.

248
00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:35.841
Well? What did they want?

249
00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:38.310
I was afraid
they were going
to execute you.

250
00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:41.079
No. It's worse than that.

251
00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:43.147
They want me to get married.

252
00:19:43.214 --> 00:19:44.883
Married? You?

253
00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:53.191
I would lose
all my freedom.
I'm pro-single!

254
00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:56.460
How can I be pro-single
and married at the same time?

255
00:19:56.527 --> 00:19:58.830
It's impossible!

256
00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:01.366
Listen. brother.
Let's keep
the Thut myth alive.

257
00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:06.104
Not even the princess.

258
00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:09.141
Wait.
Did you say "the princess"?

259
00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:10.575
That's awesome!

260
00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:13.244
We're gonna be rich!
Like. forever!

261
00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:17.816
And live in the palace!

262
00:20:17.882 --> 00:20:20.318
Princess or not.
I don't want to get married.

263
00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.921
No matter how many people
might clean for me.

264
00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.690
Whoa. is that the wedding ring?
It's huge!

265
00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.993
-Here. let me have it.
-No.

266
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.399
-It's heavy!
-Yeah. like a ball and chain.

267
00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.601
Sekhem. do you take
this Croc

268
00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:39.438
to be your
lawfully wedded crocodile?

269
00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:42.574
Would you give that back?
My life depends on this ring.

270
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.476
I'm not even gonna keep it
at home.

271
00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:47.746
This ring is going where
nobody else can get to it.

272
00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:01.726
Wow! Your trophies!

273
00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:04.162
Don't touch anything.

274
00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.397
Understood?

275
00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:12.371
It will be safe here.

276
00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:15.574
Okay. let's go.

277
00:21:35.393 --> 00:21:38.296
Would you look at that?

278
00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:41.366
It is full
of wonderful things!

279
00:21:41.432 --> 00:21:44.602
-Um. is it my turn now?
-No. I go next.

280
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:46.438
-No. 'cause it's mine.
-You're always like this.

281
00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.973
-I... go... next!
-Stop it!

282
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.574
This is serious archaeology.

283
00:21:52.543 --> 00:21:54.779
Mother!
You'll never guess what...

284
00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:58.383
Ow!

285
00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.991
You!

286
00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.598
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

287
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.866
Huh?

288
00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.639
and not touch anything.

289
00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:22.574
I gave you one job!

290
00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.781
You great big nincom--

291
00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.950
-Wait. What's that?
-Huh?

292
00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:33.585
Oh. go on then.

293
00:22:35.553 --> 00:22:39.725
Oh! A royal wedding ring.

294
00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:50.635
Oh. yes!

295
00:22:52.536 --> 00:22:54.438
What the--

296
00:22:54.505 --> 00:22:58.009
Mm!

297
00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:02.781
Aah!

298
00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:07.251
The charioteer?

299
00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:09.755
No. no. What happened?

300
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:16.995
The ring. Where's the ring?
It's gone!

301
00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:19.697
It's disappeared!

302
00:23:19.764 --> 00:23:21.099
Gah!

303
00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:27.572
By the God Ra. this could
only be the work of...

304
00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:30.041
Livings!

305
00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:37.949
This will be the jewel
of my new exhibition.

306
00:23:39.717 --> 00:23:43.555
Call the royal guard!

307
00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.656
It's just a ring.
Buy another one.

308
00:23:45.723 --> 00:23:48.126
It's the ring.
Don't you get it?

309
00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:50.261
If I don't find it
they'll cut out my tongue

310
00:23:50.327 --> 00:23:52.664
and scoop out my eyes.

311
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.732
The only way to get it back
is to go to...

312
00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.401
the world of the living.

313
00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:59.170
Really? Great!
What an adventure!

314
00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:01.539
Adventure? It's dangerous!

315
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:04.609
Ahem! You're not alone.
You have a team.

316
00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.277
There is no way
you are coming.

317
00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:10.982
They are mummy robbers.

318
00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:16.321
Listen. brother.

319
00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:19.224
May the Gods protect us.

320
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:03.067
Sekhem!

321
00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:06.037
It would reveal
our true nature
to the living.

322
00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:31.963
-Look out!
-Whoa!

323
00:25:32.763 --> 00:25:34.632
What was that?

324
00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:37.535
A giant chariot.
But where are the horses?

325
00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:38.803
Thut!

326
00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.346
There! They've got the ring!

327
00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:52.483
-Whoa!
-Nice one. Lord--

328
00:25:55.653 --> 00:25:58.623
The ring! This will be easier
than I thought. Wait here.

329
00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:06.864
Right now.
get that thing over there.

330
00:26:06.931 --> 00:26:08.667
and shove it over there.

331
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:12.270
Right.
there's no space over there.

332
00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.044
Sekhem!
What are you doing here?

333
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.012
Look! The ring is
in that other steel beast!

334
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.947
What do you mean?
Which other one?

335
00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:25.650
Quickly!
The beasts are migrating!

336
00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:35.126
Thut. come on!
Thut! Pull yourself up!

337
00:26:37.528 --> 00:26:40.298
-What's
happened to you?
-Uh. this is going too fast.

338
00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:43.935
No. Focus on your mission.

339
00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:46.637
That's it.
thinking about the ring.

340
00:26:46.704 --> 00:26:51.075
Should be nice and easy.

341
00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:54.312
Hmm... This could
take a while.

342
00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.485
Nothing.
It must be in
one of the other--

343
00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:06.891
Someone's coming!
Quick. hide!

344
00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:17.836
CARNABY CORP

345
00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:22.707
THIS SIDE UP

346
00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.779
WARNING - THIS DOOR IS
BLOCKED FROM THE INSIDE

347
00:27:32.483 --> 00:27:34.319
-Go!
-Where are we?

348
00:27:34.385 --> 00:27:36.353
Don't worry. Everything is
gonna be all right.

349
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.590
The sooner we find the ring.
the sooner we're home.

350
00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:39.991
Quickly! No time to lose.

351
00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:44.229
Shh! We're not alone.

352
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.577
Oh. what? You?

353
00:27:59.643 --> 00:28:01.579
Ha-ha!

354
00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:04.115
Whoa! Uh-oh!

355
00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.351
-Princess!
-Help.

356
00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:14.091
Huh?

357
00:28:14.158 --> 00:28:16.261
Oh. Princess Nefer's here.

358
00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:18.263
Wait a minute!
Princess Nefer?
Why are you here?

359
00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:21.332
Uh. the question...
is why are you here?

360
00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:24.902
Running away?

361
00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:28.105
Thut runs from nobody!
He's the bravest.

362
00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:30.375
Although. he did
lose the ring.

363
00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.876
-Sekhem!
-Lost the ring?

364
00:28:31.942 --> 00:28:33.811
No. but that's great!

365
00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:37.882
Then we don't have to
get married!

366
00:28:37.948 --> 00:28:40.417
-They're gonna take my eyes!
-But think:

367
00:28:40.484 --> 00:28:43.921
Eyes... eternal marriage.
Eyes... eternal marriage.

368
00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.189
Come on!
They're not that nice.

369
00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.858
You still got
four other senses.

370
00:28:46.924 --> 00:28:48.893
They take my tongue. too.

371
00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:50.795
Then you still have
three other senses.

372
00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:52.730
Enough.
I don't wanna talk about it.

373
00:28:52.796 --> 00:28:54.565
Let's get out of here.

374
00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.604
Mm-mm.
It's locked from the outside.

375
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.205
We are stuck in here.

376
00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:04.509
Oh. yeah?
That's what you think.
Watch and learn.

377
00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:12.049
And I pass
into the afterlife!

378
00:29:12.116 --> 00:29:14.752
-I win!
-Congrats. you beat a kid.

379
00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:16.353
Nah. nah. nah-nah. nah!

380
00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:22.259
Should I tell him?
Or you?

381
00:29:22.326 --> 00:29:24.695
-You! You're his brother.
-You're the princess.

382
00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:26.364
-So?
-And his fiancee.

383
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.465
Oh. come on.
that doesn't count!

384
00:29:28.532 --> 00:29:29.834
Um. I'm not--

385
00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:31.903
Agh! Hey!

386
00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:37.709
Oh. sweet Mother of Horus.
That's the sea!

387
00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:39.410
Oh.
well done. genius.

388
00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:41.245
Well. excuse me. Princess.

389
00:29:41.311 --> 00:29:43.081
Maybe we wouldn't be here
if you hadn't hit me with a--

390
00:29:43.147 --> 00:29:44.449
Oh. come on.
would you relax?

391
00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:46.417
If we escape now.
we'll be lost at sea.

392
00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:49.254
We have to wait
until we get to land.

393
00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:02.667
Croc. Shut up.

394
00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.068
Croc!

395
00:30:10.407 --> 00:30:11.475
Gah!

396
00:30:14.077 --> 00:30:15.946
A princess who snores?

397
00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:17.982
And I bet she farts.

398
00:30:46.343 --> 00:30:49.047
That's it. Lower. lower.

399
00:30:55.252 --> 00:30:57.956
Come on! Let's go.
We have to find the ring.

400
00:31:05.062 --> 00:31:06.631
Uh!

401
00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:14.672
Whoa-ho-ho!

402
00:31:14.738 --> 00:31:16.107
-Ha-ha!
-Sekhem!

403
00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:21.712
Oh. my Osiris.

404
00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.281
What place is this?

405
00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:26.183
Amun. I've never seen
anything like it.

406
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.186
-Babylon!
-No. this is way bigger.

407
00:31:29.253 --> 00:31:31.789
There's only one power
that could surpass Egypt.

408
00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:33.791
The Roman Empire!

409
00:31:33.857 --> 00:31:37.594
Exactly. Guys.
we are in Rome.

410
00:31:38.962 --> 00:31:39.998
TRADITIONAL
FISH & CHIPS

411
00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:45.637
Hey. look at that!

412
00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.204
-Give it here. Give it!
-No. I go next!

413
00:31:47.271 --> 00:31:51.208
-You shut your cake hole!
-Careful!

414
00:31:51.275 --> 00:31:54.111
Be quiet!
Just put it down. Now.

415
00:31:55.879 --> 00:31:57.014
You stupid...

416
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.287
Mother!

417
00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:05.222
Of course. Mother.
how could I forget?

418
00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:07.225
Why didn't you idiots
remind me

419
00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:09.560
I had tickets
to the theater today?

420
00:32:09.626 --> 00:32:11.462
I'm on my way. Mummy.

421
00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:13.598
To the theater.

422
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.981
Quick! Hide!

423
00:32:33.784 --> 00:32:35.619
Uh...

424
00:32:35.686 --> 00:32:37.188
Huh?

425
00:32:38.422 --> 00:32:40.191
Yeah.

426
00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:42.360
Oh. I love Romans!

427
00:32:56.707 --> 00:32:58.375
What are those
light rays?

428
00:32:58.442 --> 00:33:01.980
They're stealing our souls!

429
00:33:17.728 --> 00:33:19.130
Me. too.

430
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.932
Ahem!

431
00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:25.203
Ah! The Gods
are protecting us!
We're saved!

432
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:27.505
Look! They left
their weapons!

433
00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:30.141
Come on.
Nothing can stop us.

434
00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:33.578
Hm!

435
00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.313
Sylvester! You're late.

436
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.250
But I don't mind
because you'll always be
my little one!

437
00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:40.685
Oh. Mummy. please.

438
00:33:42.586 --> 00:33:45.923
Not in public.
No. Mummy don't. please.

439
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:51.729
There. That's better.

440
00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.466
Hey. what are you
doing here?

441
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:58.536
Ha-hah!
Step back. Roman!

442
00:33:59.703 --> 00:34:02.473
Uh... Wha...
These weapons are useless!

443
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.608
Okay. okay.
Your Instagram stuff
is done.

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:06.476

Come on. here we go.
Stage door.

446
00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.780

448
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.818
-What?
-Oh!

449
00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:17.021
Whoa!

450
00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.356
This is a strange
Egyptian colony.

451
00:34:19.423 --> 00:34:21.358
Stay with me.
I'll protect you.

452
00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:23.494
Hey. dears. hurry up!

453
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.096
No! Wait. We're looking
for Hathor's ring!

454
00:34:26.163 --> 00:34:28.199
I demand that you tell me
where it is!

455
00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:31.134
You're in character.
I like it.

456
00:34:31.201 --> 00:34:33.404
Approved. Now go
and wait for your cue!

457
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.074
Oh! Uh... Hey.

458
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:39.644
-That one is such a diva.
-Oh. yes.

459
00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:43.013
Um. does this colony
have a Pharaoh?

460
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.049
You're talking to him. honey.

461
00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:46.818

530
00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.430
Huh?

531
00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.800
Look! The chariot's tied up!

532
00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:58.135
Hey. guys!

533
00:38:58.202 --> 00:39:01.572
Hi! I was looking for you.
I need to talk to her.
She's--

534
00:39:01.638 --> 00:39:05.275
Thanks. but no thanks.

535
00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.911
I heard you sing in there--

536
00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:10.347
And how many does this have?

537
00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:13.516
I don't really
do cars. but--

538
00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:15.452
We have to run!
He wants the ring!

539
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.788
I'm here to help.
Get in!

540
00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.461
What?

541
00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.265
<i> Sylvester!</i>

542
00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:31.802
Yes. Mother?

543
00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:34.671
Please. excuse Thut.
He's just very. well...

544
00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:38.775
Who are you?

545
00:39:38.842 --> 00:39:41.712
I heard you sing in there
and I absolutely
loved your voice.

546
00:39:41.778 --> 00:39:43.614
Uh. well.
the joke's on you. pal.

547
00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.882
because I didn't even sing.

548
00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:47.083
so. I don't know
what you were watching.

549
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.053
Not you. mate. Her.

550
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.754
Me? Yeah?

551
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.490
So I've got a song
I've wrote

552
00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:54.592
Would you like
to sing it for me?

553
00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:58.128
-Uh... Wow. I...
-Thanks. Ed.

554
00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:01.999
She would love to.

555
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.868
Could you stop? Please?

556
00:40:11.374 --> 00:40:12.676
Hey. hey. think about it.

557
00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.444
and get me through Insta
or Facebook.

558
00:40:14.511 --> 00:40:16.513
-Uh. where?
-Thanks! Bye!

559
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.183
Now. can we please focus
on returning home?

560
00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.521
Uh...

561
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:26.657
I'm sorry about him.
Thank you for saving us.

562
00:40:26.723 --> 00:40:29.159
Hey. if you need me.
you'll find me here.

563
00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.994
Sure. Will do.

564
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.096
Ha!

565
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.176
Why don't you
give me a choice?

566
00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:48.578
He has seen something
special in me. Thut.

567
00:40:48.645 --> 00:40:50.648
A choice?
None of us have a choice.

568
00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:53.850
We belong in the After World.
You are the Princess.

569
00:40:53.917 --> 00:40:55.786
I have been dreaming
all my life

570
00:40:55.852 --> 00:40:58.021
about what I want to do.
and that is singing.

571
00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.790
I don't know
if I want to go back

572
00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:01.959
and spend an eternity
bound to a...

573
00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:05.863
To have my dreams dismissed.

574
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:16.006
-Um... technically. he didn't.
-What?

575
00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:20.544
What do you mean.
"technically"?

576
00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:24.648
It's not like he saw you
and chose you
or anything. Sorry...

577
00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.950
Sekhem! You...

578
00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:29.253
Beautiful boy!

579
00:41:29.319 --> 00:41:30.587
Do you know
what this means?

580
00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.323
I get to remain single!

581
00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:36.359
And I don't have to
marry you!

582
00:41:36.426 --> 00:41:37.327
Me. too!

583
00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.899
Ugh!

584
00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:46.136
Okay. let's find a boat
to go home.

585
00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:48.238
We're running out of time.

586
00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:51.075
Wow! It's a magic Stargate.

587
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:52.642
Maybe we can enter there.

588
00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:55.012
And then home.
Sekhem. you're a genius.

589
00:41:55.078 --> 00:41:56.079
I love it.

590
00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:57.948
Oh. by the way.
This is for you.

591
00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.115
Uh. hey. guys?

592
00:41:59.182 --> 00:42:01.051
-This isn't the ring.
-Isn't the ring?

593
00:42:01.117 --> 00:42:03.887
What do you mean
it isn't the ring?

594
00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:06.757
Oh. my tongue and eyes
are still on the line here.

595
00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:09.793
Look. I may not want
to spend eternity with you.

596
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.897
but even an ex-charioteer
doesn't deserve that.

597
00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:15.365
Thank you. Princess.
That's very kind of you.

598
00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:17.868
But we have to start again.
and time is running out.

599
00:42:17.934 --> 00:42:21.171
We can't do anything now.

600
00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:23.473
Ed's a nice guy.
He offered
to take us home.

601
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.311
Ed?

602
00:42:27.377 --> 00:42:28.478
I'd rather sleep here.

603
00:42:30.346 --> 00:42:33.250
Uh. hair? Wet? No way.

604
00:42:39.656 --> 00:42:44.394
-Hey!
-Hi. Ed.

605
00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:47.197
Uh. sure!
Yeah. Come on in.

606
00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.665
-Thank you.
-Ooh!

607
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.634
Oh. nice... dog.

608
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.236
Ah!

609
00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.509
-Hey. hey...
-Whoa!

610
00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:11.254
So. would you sing
the song for me?

611
00:43:11.321 --> 00:43:13.791
-Uh. yes.
-Yes!

612
00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:16.126
You won't be sorry.
It's gonna be a hit!

613
00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:20.097
Ooh. hear that?
It's gonna be a hit.

614
00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:21.999
Ed. what's a hit?

615
00:43:24.767 --> 00:43:27.671
Yes! Funny and beautiful.

616
00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.340
Let's go to the studio.

617
00:43:34.444 --> 00:43:36.546
Ooh! You look great. bro.

618
00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:38.816
Whoo!

619
00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:06.176
Yeah.

620
00:44:06.242 --> 00:44:09.846
Don't get me wrong.
she has some
positive qualities.

621
00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:14.084
She's determined.
strong. intelligent.

622
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.919
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

623
00:44:17.053 --> 00:44:20.124
But. you know. She snores.

624
00:44:26.896 --> 00:44:28.698
Uh. what's going on?

625
00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:30.934
The singer
that ruined the play.

626
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.936
She was wearing a symbol.

627
00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:36.039
-The same symbol
that is in the ring.
-So?

628
00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:39.243
So the legend
behind the ring is true.

629
00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.113
Oh!

630
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.615
She has come back
to get her ring.

631
00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.451
And I have it.

632
00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:53.757
What could be a more
amazing discovery

633
00:44:53.823 --> 00:44:57.294
than an undiscovered
royal Egyptian ring?

634
00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.697
Uh. two undiscovered
royal Egyptian rings!

635
00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.799
Two? There are two? Amazing.

636
00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:03.967
No. you morons!

637
00:45:04.033 --> 00:45:06.002
I'm talking about
a living mummy!

638
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:07.670
<i> Calling Mummy.</i>

639
00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.908
<i> Calling Mummy.</i>

640
00:45:11.808 --> 00:45:13.376
<i> Sylvester!</i>

641
00:45:13.443 --> 00:45:14.844
Mummy? I can't talk now.

642
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:17.380
<i> What? Don't you want to talk
to your mother?</i>

643
00:45:17.447 --> 00:45:20.083
Oh. no. no.
No. Mummy. it's not that.

644
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.619
We don't need the phone
because...

645
00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:24.354
I'm right beside you!

646
00:45:29.092 --> 00:45:30.327
I have made
the most important

647
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.462
archaeological discovery
of all time.

648
00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:33.963
-Mm...
-I guarantee you.

649
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.100
the whole world
will now know the name

650
00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.903
of Lord Sylvester Carnaby.

651
00:45:44.407 --> 00:45:46.075
Why?

652
00:45:46.142 --> 00:45:48.145
<i> ♪ No matter what time
No matter the place! ♪</i>

653
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:52.048
<i> ♪ Rise and shine
It's a beautiful day! ♪</i>

654
00:45:52.115 --> 00:45:54.284
Morning. my star.
Morning. little bro.

655
00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:55.619
dog and... you. too.

656
00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.387
Listen. big day ahead of us.

657
00:45:57.454 --> 00:46:02.459
I want to stream a video
of Nefer's performance.

658
00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:05.395
Thoughts.
feelings and thoughts.
What say you guys?

659
00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:09.499
Oh. yeah. great.
But we have things to do.

660
00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:13.369
-Oh. come on.
-Cool.

661
00:46:13.436 --> 00:46:17.307
Uh. well. we. uh...
lost our baggage.

662
00:46:17.373 --> 00:46:19.709
Jeez. that happens to me
all the time when I fly.

663
00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:23.580
You fly?

664
00:46:23.646 --> 00:46:25.114
'Cause vintage is out.

665
00:46:25.181 --> 00:46:28.185
and my star needs a new look.

666
00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:32.021
Don't worry.
That means he likes you.

667
00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:34.458
I don't know what's worse.
Freaky dog.

668
00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:36.460
You need to feed that thing.

669
00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:38.528
PARROTS

670
00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.831
Whoa! Look!

671
00:46:41.531 --> 00:46:43.533
PARROTS

672
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.102
Okay. Follow me!

673
00:46:46.169 --> 00:46:47.303
-Thut!
-Thut!

674
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.872
-Look out. Thut! Over there!
-Mm?

675
00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.841
-Look out!
-Thut!

676
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.579
Whoa! Whoa!

677
00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.788
There! I don't think
anybody noticed us. do you?

678
00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:06.423
Uh...

679
00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:09.359
At least there won't be
any wedding night surprises.

680
00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:11.528
Huh?

681
00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.431
A little help here. please.

682
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.099
Ooh! There!

683
00:47:18.568 --> 00:47:21.004
Hmm. Thanks!

684
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:23.607
No time to waste. Let's go.

685
00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:13.156
Thut

686
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:19.262
<i> Attention.</i>

687
00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:22.098
<i> ...that this store
will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

688
00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.933
From the sky!

689
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.571
It's Ra!
The voice of the Sun God.

690
00:48:27.637 --> 00:48:33.276
Oh. Ra. God of the Sun.
God of Life. light our path!

691
00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.144
What should we do. oh. Ra?

692
00:48:35.211 --> 00:48:37.681
<i> Please. kindly
finish your shopping...</i>

693
00:48:37.747 --> 00:48:41.050
-We have.
-<i> ...and proceed
towards the exits.</i>

694
00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:43.754
As you command. oh. great Ra.

695
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.692
-Oh! That way!
-Oh. thank you. magnificent Ra!

696
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.134
Yeah! Lookin'... uh--

697
00:48:58.635 --> 00:48:59.536
Yeah!

698
00:49:01.304 --> 00:49:03.106
Listen. I've got the song
loaded up.

699
00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.774
We're ready to stream
a live performance!

700
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.110
I've been promoting
through my Insta all afternoon.

701
00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:08.945
Ed. we don't speak Latin.

702
00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:10.346
They won't just hear you.

703
00:49:10.413 --> 00:49:12.082
they're gonna see you as well.

704
00:49:12.148 --> 00:49:14.851
-They'll see me?
-Of course. on the computer.

705
00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:18.321
Will I fit in there?

706
00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:20.557
No. not you!
It is a "streaming."

707
00:49:20.623 --> 00:49:24.127
"Live Internet"?
You don't get it. dude.

708
00:49:25.161 --> 00:49:28.031
You are going to slay.

709
00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:29.365
Slay?

710
00:49:29.432 --> 00:49:32.301
It means do a good job.
right bro?

711
00:49:32.368 --> 00:49:34.404
I don't think
this is a good idea.

712
00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:37.941
It's the first time someone
has ever asked me to sing.

713
00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:39.041
-But. Nefer...
-Thut!

714
00:49:39.108 --> 00:49:41.244
Time is running out.

715
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:56.026
Then make this decision.
I'll support you.

716
00:49:57.794 --> 00:49:59.595
Wow. Thanks. Thut.

717
00:49:59.662 --> 00:50:01.631
That means a lot.

718
00:50:03.132 --> 00:50:08.905
Well. do your thing.

719
00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:12.009
Gimme five! Up top! Hah!

720
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:15.745
Yeah!

721
00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:18.148

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.864

747
00:52:00.282 --> 00:52:03.186
You know what?

748
00:52:03.252 --> 00:52:05.288
Perhaps this is my place.

749
00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.356
I've only been here a few days

750
00:52:07.423 --> 00:52:09.659
and already my dreams
are coming true.

751
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.498
That's... really good...
for you.

752
00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:17.767
Oh. come on. you'll be fine.

753
00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:20.770
I gave you my word

754
00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.305
We'll find it.

755
00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.252
He's not like the rest.

756
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.053
Maybe we...

757
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.390
Come on. what am I saying?

758
00:52:40.456 --> 00:52:42.459
I know. I know.

759
00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:44.127
We're from two
different worlds. anyway.

760
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:53.570
Croc! It's Croc!

761
00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.605
Something's wrong with him!

762
00:52:58.742 --> 00:52:59.676
Nefer!

763
00:53:01.944 --> 00:53:03.480
Nefer! No!

764
00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:21.765
Nefer!

765
00:53:22.598 --> 00:53:24.067
Where are they taking her?

766
00:53:24.133 --> 00:53:26.703
I recognize those men.

767
00:53:26.769 --> 00:53:28.471
We need to follow that chariot.

768
00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.373
It belongs
to the Carnaby Museum.

769
00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.874
How do you know that?
Are you in on this?

770
00:53:31.941 --> 00:53:34.577
-Was this your plan all along?
-What? In on this?

771
00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:36.546
The van belongs
to the Carnaby Museum.

772
00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.415
It said it on the side!

773
00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:42.552
I blame you for this. Ed.
So stay out of my way. got it?

774
00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:46.188
I'll get to that museum.
I've got a princess to save.

775
00:53:46.255 --> 00:53:47.857
You're crazy.
You'll never get in.

776
00:53:47.923 --> 00:53:50.660
Their security is mental!

777
00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:55.231
No. You stay here.
It's dangerous.

778
00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:58.301
I'm your brother
and you will obey me.

779
00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.631
Princess...

780
00:54:35.604 --> 00:54:37.207
Princess...

781
00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:39.241
Princess Nefer.

782
00:54:39.308 --> 00:54:41.811
So delightful to meet you.

783
00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:45.115
Let me...
Let me go.

784
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.951
Unfortunately. I can't do that.

785
00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:51.688
This morning is the opening
of my greatest exhibition yet.

786
00:54:56.326 --> 00:55:00.930
Originally. the centerpiece
was going to be your ring.

787
00:55:00.996 --> 00:55:03.299
But now... you.

788
00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:06.536
You are my greatest discovery.

789
00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.738
And when I reveal you
to the world.

790
00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:13.076
yours won't be the only name
that goes down in history.

791
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:16.780
And if you thought your
little song made you famous.

792
00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:20.483
wait until they find out
what you really are!

793
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.685
You can't do this.

794
00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:25.355
-Thut will...
-I can see you!

795
00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.791
He will come for me.

796
00:55:29.458 --> 00:55:34.197
There you are!

797
00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.399
Now... if you'll excuse me.

798
00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:39.035
I've an exhibition to prepare.

799
00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:45.008
THE CARNABY MUSEUM

800
00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:16.505
Wait. this is all my stuff!

801
00:56:16.572 --> 00:56:19.475
Wow. an entire section
dedicated to me.

802
00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.477
"The treasures
of Thut the Fleet of Foot."

803
00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:23.346
What a nickname!
Hmm?

804
00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.281
One hundred-time
chariot racing champion?

805
00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:27.950
What? It's 112 plus one.

806
00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:29.152
Idiots.

807
00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:32.789
Nefer?

808
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.392
Nefer!

809
00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:38.561
Oh. no.
What have they done to you?

810
00:56:38.627 --> 00:56:41.464
You look like humans.
but you're really

811
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:43.633
ancient Egyptian mummies.

812
00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:48.637
-You!
-Welcome to your new home.

813
00:56:48.704 --> 00:56:51.206
Not so fast!

814
00:56:51.273 --> 00:56:52.142
Huh?

815
00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:41.057
Look. bro. I can help.
Let's rescue the grumpy guy.

816
00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.160
Ha...

817
00:57:45.327 --> 00:57:47.463
I can't.

818
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.532
Oh. jeez. I'm in bad shape.

819
00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.968
Don't worry.
You stay here. watching.

820
00:57:52.734 --> 00:57:55.071
Hold it. I see a hawk.

821
00:58:05.514 --> 00:58:06.616
Shh!

822
00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:10.953
You sure this is okay. Danny?

823
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.957
Lord Carnaby said not to leave
the princess unattended.

824
00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.059
We're the only ones
in the building.

825
00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.394
Besides. how can we
protect the princess

826
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:19.862
on an empty stomach?

827
00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:22.165
Uh. all right. Makes sense.

828
00:58:24.366 --> 00:58:25.869
SNACKERS

829
00:58:32.174 --> 00:58:33.877
Uh-oh. What have we done?

830
00:58:34.343 --> 00:58:35.245
Hmm.

831
00:58:37.646 --> 00:58:39.249
Umm... Ah-ha!

832
00:58:40.015 --> 00:58:41.150
Perfect.

833
00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:58.101
Thut?

834
00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.738
You know what?
I think you're cute.

835
00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:05.041
Thanks. You're pretty.

836
00:59:05.107 --> 00:59:06.876
We've got
to get them out. quick!

837
00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:09.211
I told you to keep watch
over the princess.

838
00:59:09.278 --> 00:59:12.681
Sorry. Mr. Carnaby.

839
00:59:12.748 --> 00:59:16.219
Then we got stuck
in the vending machine.

840
00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:20.623
Mm-hmm.

841
00:59:22.324 --> 00:59:25.328
Mm.

842
00:59:25.394 --> 00:59:27.163
It's coming
from the exhibition.

843
00:59:27.229 --> 00:59:29.098
It's the princess!

844
00:59:29.164 --> 00:59:31.534
Don't just stand there.
you blithering idiots!

845
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.669
My... my chocky bar is...

846
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.005
Get the princess!

847
00:59:37.506 --> 00:59:38.741
Are you okay?

848
00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:39.809
Hey. Thut...

849
00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:44.012
Sekhem is so... so hero-ish.

850
00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:47.150
Thanks.
He learned it all from me.

851
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.156
Someone's been here.

852
00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.957
Keep your eyes peeled.

853
00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:58.328
It's them!
Quick. hide!

854
01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:07.536
and I can stand
on my own two feet.

855
01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.371
Huh?

856
01:00:09.438 --> 01:00:10.773
What was that?

857
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.909
-Wha...
-Hm.

858
01:00:13.976 --> 01:00:16.312
Did I tell you
that you're cute?

859
01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:19.649
Yeah. I...
I feel very strongly that you--

860
01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.885
Ew! They're kissing! Blech!

861
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.060
The ring!

862
01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:34.197
No. She's escaped!

863
01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.465
You fools! You imbeciles!

864
01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:38.401
I give you one job...

865
01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.705
Guys?

866
01:00:43.772 --> 01:00:45.508
-Ha-ha!
-Hoo-hoo!

867
01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.342
We escaped your little trap!

868
01:00:47.409 --> 01:00:51.847
Now. we'll ruin
your special little
opening day.

869
01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:54.083
Stop!

870
01:01:00.756 --> 01:01:04.327
Ha!

871
01:01:04.393 --> 01:01:06.996
-Go!
-Get them.

872
01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.842
Hey!

873
01:01:23.545 --> 01:01:24.547
Hah!

874
01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:31.220
Come on!

875
01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:34.257
Ha-hah!

876
01:01:39.027 --> 01:01:40.963
Hey. look! Let's get that!

877
01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:45.667
There they go! Quick!

878
01:01:45.734 --> 01:01:47.570
Chariot driver.
drive the chariot!

879
01:01:47.636 --> 01:01:50.339
Well. I've... never driven
a chariot like this.

880
01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.308
I did! I can do it!

881
01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:54.776
-Please!
-What. seriously. the kid?

882
01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:59.949
-Go!
-Croc. buddy. get the pedals.

883
01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.291
Ugh! Get the van! Get the van!

884
01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.398
Where do I go?

885
01:02:16.465 --> 01:02:18.300
Yeah! Ra is with us!

886
01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.903
-Ra is a woman?
-Got a problem with that?

887
01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.007
I'm obeying the rules
of the road.

888
01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.443
-The speed limit is--
-Forget the speed limit.

889
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.478
Get out of the way. Let me.

890
01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.180
Right. Here we go.

891
01:02:34.516 --> 01:02:35.818
Croc. come on!

892
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.658
Slow down. slow down.
slow down. slow down!

893
01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:44.126
You don't slow down in a chase!

894
01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.496
Not slowing down
is the whole point!

895
01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.899
<i> Next stop.
Russell Square Station.</i>

896
01:02:50.966 --> 01:02:53.368
<i>Final destination. South Bank.</i>

897
01:02:53.435 --> 01:02:55.738
Ra says to stop next!
Do what Ra says!

898
01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.440
No. he says to stop
at the pier!

899
01:02:57.506 --> 01:03:00.042
Don't worry. big brother.
He who dares wins!

900
01:03:00.108 --> 01:03:03.813
Dies! We're gonna die!

901
01:03:03.879 --> 01:03:06.849
They won't get away from me.
I want my mummy!

902
01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.984
-<i> Calling Mommy.</i>
-I meant that mummy!

903
01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.486
-<i> Calling Mommy.</i>
-No. I know...

904
01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.521
<i> Sylvester?
What are you doing?</i>

905
01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.256
Not now. Mother! I'm driving!

906
01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:16.893
<i> It's not safe to drive
and talk on the phone.</i>

907
01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.133
Croc!

908
01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.503
Whoa!

909
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.952
I'll show you!

910
01:03:44.019 --> 01:03:46.489
I can't shake him.
What do I do?

911
01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:48.424
Thut!

912
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.800
See that ramp up ahead?
Drive right for it.

913
01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.535
But that boat.
it's already leaving.

914
01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.038
Then we'd better go faster.

915
01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.220
Now! Turn and slam the brakes!

916
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.774
You made it! Way to go. boss!

917
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.276
Yeah. but the people
we were chasing are back there.

918
01:04:41.343 --> 01:04:43.312
-Guess we can't get 'em now.
-Shut up. would you?

919
01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:47.083
I will chase them to the end
of the world if necessary.

920
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.686
You haven't seen
the last of me!

921
01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.154
Bye.

922
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.290
Yeah!

923
01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:56.259
-We're safe!
-Well done!

924
01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.500
You were great. Sekhem.

925
01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:05.968
Thanks. big bro.

926
01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:13.776
So. fancy explaining

927
01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.679
why a chariot racer
is frightened of going fast?

928
01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:18.480
Oh. that. Oh. well...

929
01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:21.383
It's just that
I don't feel comfortable

930
01:05:21.449 --> 01:05:23.119
driving a chariot
with no horses.

931
01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.321
I don't trust what I can't see.

932
01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.093
kissing you at the museum.
I just--

933
01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.561
-Oh. yeah. I--
-I just wasn't think--

934
01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.397
-And this dart--
-No. I'm sorry for that.

935
01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.732
I mean. I'm also sorry
about the kissing.

936
01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.500
Yeah. well. good. good. good.

937
01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.069
that we can be honest
with each other.

938
01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.204
Okay. mummies.
back to the After World.

939
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:45.674
Let's walk like Egyptians!

940
01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.076
Yeah. We've only got two suns
before the curse falls.

941
01:05:48.143 --> 01:05:49.211
and I lose my eyes and tongue.

942
01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.380
I mean. you know. the usual.

943
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.748
Well. let's just
use the Stargate.

944
01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:56.519
It's over there.

945
01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.820
That's a Ferris Wheel.

946
01:05:57.886 --> 01:06:00.289
Oh. so no time travel?

947
01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:03.592
Just all the time...
at the same place.

948
01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.694
Oh. Ra.
Unless flying like a falcon

949
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.965
is a thing in the human world.
we're finished.

950
01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:14.103
Uh. yeah. wow!

951
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.204
-Um. she's gorgeous.
-Let me--

952
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:18.640
-Is that relevant?
-No. Wait.

953
01:06:18.707 --> 01:06:20.742
Wait for it...

954
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:21.810
Yes!

955
01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:22.745
Huh.

956
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:30.986
The God Horus?

957
01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.822
Horus himself is gonna take us?
Wow!

958
01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:37.059
Fly to Egypt
EGYPTAIR

959
01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:38.527
Hours! Five hours!

960
01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:39.795
-Perfect.
-Yes!

961
01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.530
Whoo!

962
01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:52.375
Well. I think it's time
for you to choose. Princess.

963
01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.184
So...

964
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.220
Can you imagine
if we'd had to marry?

965
01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:14.189
You and me? Huh!
We'd be like oil and water.

966
01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:15.758
Totally.

967
01:08:22.297 --> 01:08:25.734
But you know. I...
should probably thank you.

968
01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.404
You were very brave.
charioteer.

969
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.874
Uh... No. Not at all.

970
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.544
In fact. I'm not actually
who you think I am.

971
01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:39.582
<i>I retired because I got scared.</i>

972
01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.654
<i> And since then.
speed makes me panic.</i>

973
01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:49.090
So... no.

974
01:08:49.157 --> 01:08:51.894
I'm not brave. Not at all.

975
01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:00.869
If you weren't brave.

976
01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:03.572
you wouldn't have
risked your life to rescue me.

977
01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.680
You're braver
than you think. Thut.

978
01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:16.552
Yeah. well... I don't know.

979
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.798
Give it here! Give it!

980
01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:38.206
Look. just 'cause you
went to the posh school--

981
01:10:43.004 --> 01:10:44.205
-So...
-You. uh...

982
01:10:44.272 --> 01:10:46.408
Oh. Sorry. No. you...

983
01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:50.345
Uh. well. I suppose...

984
01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:53.314
it's goodbye. Princess.

985
01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:55.718
Goodbye. charioteer.

986
01:11:12.567 --> 01:11:14.336
Turn around.

987
01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.548
Turn around. please.

988
01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:07.455
I'm sorry. Father.
I was afraid that--

989
01:12:07.522 --> 01:12:10.459
You can't imagine
how worried I have been.

990
01:13:30.505 --> 01:13:33.075
A city of living mummies.

991
01:13:34.142 --> 01:13:36.445
The legend lives.

992
01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.547
Whoa!
It wasn't a legend after all.

993
01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.383
Not after today. Danny.
Not after today.

994
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.585
He's Danny. I'm Dennys.

995
01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.720
Do not ruin the moment.

996
01:13:45.787 --> 01:13:48.456
Uh... where is the princess?

997
01:13:48.523 --> 01:13:50.025
Princess? Heh!

998
01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.529
Who needs a princess
when you can have a pharaoh?

999
01:13:56.164 --> 01:13:58.767
Sire. they've managed
to infiltrate the city

1000
01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.769
using the metal beasts.

1001
01:14:01.836 --> 01:14:03.705
Take everybody to the shelter.

1002
01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.540
I'll deploy
the city's defenses.

1003
01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.942
Go with them.

1004
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:24.626
Lord Carnaby requests
an audience with the Pharaoh.

1005
01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:31.066
They took away my exhibition.

1006
01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.067
They scoff at my name.

1007
01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:36.772
But I will show them
a living pharaoh.

1008
01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:44.646
Nefer. stay back!

1009
01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.314
This is my fault.

1010
01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.183
He followed me here.

1011
01:14:48.249 --> 01:14:50.085
This is my fight. too.

1012
01:15:01.696 --> 01:15:03.799
Thut! Thut!

1013
01:15:03.865 --> 01:15:05.868
He's here!

1014
01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:09.303
The one from the museum.
he's come!

1015
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.038
We're under attack!

1016
01:15:11.105 --> 01:15:12.874
If he wants to come.
let him come.

1017
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.478
It's that or an eternity
signing autographs. Alone.

1018
01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.780
Oh. come on!
The princess needs you!

1019
01:15:18.846 --> 01:15:20.782
She's got guards.

1020
01:15:22.617 --> 01:15:24.686
She needs the bravest
among us.

1021
01:15:24.752 --> 01:15:26.788
The supreme champion.

1022
01:15:26.854 --> 01:15:30.224
And that's you. "He who dares."

1023
01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:31.827
That's my older brother.

1024
01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.928
That's who I look up to
and idolize.

1025
01:15:33.995 --> 01:15:36.932
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and go help her.

1026
01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:02.490
Father!

1027
01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:05.594
No... Father!

1028
01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:29.084
I don't believe it!

1029
01:16:34.255 --> 01:16:36.491
-You're not going anywhere.
-Whoa! Whoa!

1030
01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.359
Foolish child!

1031
01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:40.128
You won't get away with this!

1032
01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:43.632
You want to come too?
Pesky spoiled brat!

1033
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.461
No.

1034
01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:16.163
-Thut!
-The Charioteer!

1035
01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:19.134
He's getting away!

1036
01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.268
Hyah!

1037
01:17:21.736 --> 01:17:24.339
Go. go. go!

1038
01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:26.775
Croc!

1039
01:17:46.494 --> 01:17:47.663
No!

1040
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.131
Hyah!

1041
01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.209
Here we go.

1042
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:11.186
Thut. what are you doing?

1043
01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:12.287
Thut!

1044
01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:14.890
Look out!

1045
01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:19.594
Thut. come on!
You can't let him get away!

1046
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.730
You are not alone.
You have a team.

1047
01:18:21.796 --> 01:18:24.366
Thut! Not now. come on!

1048
01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:25.801
Snap out of it!

1049
01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.737
Thut! Wake up!

1050
01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.043
Thut! Wake up. I need you!

1051
01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:39.381
It's time to take the reins!

1052
01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:06.174
Get off me. boy!
I've got you now.

1053
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:07.776
Thut!

1054
01:19:13.481 --> 01:19:14.915
No!

1055
01:19:14.982 --> 01:19:18.320
Now. you'll be my new trophy.

1056
01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.721
-Nefer!
-Thut!

1057
01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:22.124
I'll show you. mummy!

1058
01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:32.200
No. no. no. no. no!

1059
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:34.770
I love you.

1060
01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.921
No. no. Thut!

1061
01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.296
Thut!

1062
01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.102
Nefer!

1063
01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.004
Father!

1064
01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.341
That's my older brother.

1065
01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:24.052
Young charioteer.
you saved my life.

1066
01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:26.921
You did it!
You overcame your fear. Thut!

1067
01:20:26.987 --> 01:20:29.825
No. it was you.

1068
01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:32.059
I've been running from fear
this whole time.

1069
01:20:32.126 --> 01:20:33.661
Whether it was fear
to race again

1070
01:20:33.727 --> 01:20:36.064
or fear to love somebody.

1071
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:43.004
But instead...

1072
01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:47.642
Will you marry me?

1073
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:50.578
Well. the Phoenix chose you.

1074
01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:54.082
so technically.
I'm duty-bound to marry you.

1075
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.719
Yes. I will!

1076
01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:22.343
By the power vested
in me by the Goddess of love.

1077
01:21:22.409 --> 01:21:27.215
I pronounce you
wife and husband.

1078
01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:58.280
<i> All the school kids
so sick of books</i>

1079
01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.148
<i> They like the punk
and the metal band</i>

1080
01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.951
<i> When the buzzer rings
Oh way oh</i>

1081
01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.852
<i> They're walking like
an Egyptian</i>

1082
01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:06.955
<i> All the kids
in the marketplace say</i>

1083
01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:09.624
<i> Way oh way oh</i>

1084
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:12.694
<i> Way oh way oh</i>

1085
01:22:14.128 --> 01:22:16.665
<i> Walk like an Egyptian</i>

1086
01:22:18.032 --> 01:22:20.335
It's about time
things changed...

1087
01:22:20.401 --> 01:22:21.135
I suppose.
