3
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.510
- We made the
first film. Mad Max.

4
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.971
it was a low budget
Australian film

5
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.807
which seemed to resonate somehow

6
00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:00.644
with every film going
territory in the world.

7
00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.066
The obvious answer was
that it was full of car action

8
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.652
and it was violent.

9
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.700
But it seemed to have
something else there.

10
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.702
When I went to Japan.
people would say.

11
00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.495
oh. it's just like the
samurai movies.

12
00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.331
And then you'd go to
France and they'd say.

13
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.501
it's very much like
the spaghetti westerns.

14
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:31.716
They're stories that
recur. we call them myths.

15
00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:35.053
they recur in every
time and in every culture.

16
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.267
That's why we recognise
these stories almost anywhere.

17
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.648
It allows us to have
experiences and to share them

18
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.484
with all people who
have gone before

19
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.487
and those that may come after.

20
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.618
- All right. thanks everybody
for being a part of this.

21
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.331
It's been a really interesting
exercise putting it together

22
00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:06.459
so I hope you get a
real big kick out of it.

23
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.921
Now. if you have a
look at your sheets.

24
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:15.718
primarily you're going
from can to can to can.

25
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.971
They are your markers.

26
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.850
That's what you're looking for
when you go to each location.

27
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.810
- I'll sit on
somebody's lap. it's all right.

28
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:29.148
You can use any means to
work out the quiz questions.

29
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.692
So you can get on
your mobile phones.

30
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.028
you can pop the movie
in and check the film

31
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.072
if you have the
facility to do that.

32
00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.824
- We got it.
- All right. next clue.

33
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.035
- I love winning.

34
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.204
- Just behave yourselves.

35
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.290
We're not actual Road Warriors.

36
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.379
- No one was ready
for a film like Mad Max.

37
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.589
- It felt new and exciting.

38
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.426
You couldn't help
but talk about it.

39
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.220
- Does anybody
have any questions?

40
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.639
- What no speeding?

41
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.890
- No speeding.

42
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.644
- It started out as a
small. very low budget film.

43
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:10.773
very limited expectations
that turned out to be huge.

44
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.858
A big enough film
to create a sequel.

45
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.610
- Mad
Max is back in town

46
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.737
and tackling Hollywood head-on.

47
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.406
- Which then became
a phenomenon.

48
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.491
- Opening night
at cinemas across the nation

49
00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.451
was a sell out.

50
00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.202
- Now 30 years later.

51
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.995
a fourth film is on the way.

52
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.956
- Those two words. Mad Max.

53
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:31.377
they're like the McDonald's
or Star Trek or Star Wars.

54
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.546
You might not like
Mad Max. but by God.

55
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.756
you know what's
being talked about.

56
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:39.218
- Donald Trump was describing
some Mad Max America.

57
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.678
- The
world of Mad Max

58
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.139
might not be as far
away as we think.

59
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.850
- Film can tell us a lot about
who we are and where we live

60
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.560
and how we feel about things.

61
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.438
- Britain plunged into
a Mad Max style world.

62
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.483
- Mad Max is so dystopian
and so unpleasant that. yeah.

63
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.653
it's not the most obvious
film to want to emulate.

64
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.015
- Saturday.

65
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.273
You can film the
syringe. it's even worse.

66
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.527
So every morning
a little .

67
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.114
It's not pleasant.

68
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:55.044
We'll start looking like a
Frenchman. here we go.

69
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.087
Bonjour. I am Bertrand Cadart.

70
00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.632
liberal candidate
for the Seat of Lyons.

71
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.968
You may know me as the
scooter riding French mayor

72
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.136
from the east coast

73
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.139
who appeared in
the film Mad Max.

74
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.184
And this is my frog bathroom.

75
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:15.105
My frog shower mat.
my frog shower curtain.

76
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.608
My frog bath bubbly stuff.

77
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:21.278
I lived on the east coast
of Tasmania for 15 years.

78
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.364
I've been the mayor
for seven years.

79
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:27.243
- You've been in Australia
for about 40 years. I believe.

80
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.745
Is that seriously your
best Aussie accent?

81
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.959
- Yeah. yeah. ha ha.

82
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:38.796
Right.

83
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.598
I don't think I will be
able to ride anymore.

84
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.433
At least my doctor
doesn't think so

85
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.271
and I am advised not to
ride because if I do crash.

86
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:59.483
what is the normal gravel
rash for a healthy person

87
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.611
would become a
death trap for me.

88
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:08.326
The doctor. he said. it will
take six months of chemo

89
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.788
to know if I can save your life.

90
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.875
Now. my leave was denied.

91
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.755
It is why I have no
choice but to resign.

92
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.382
Thank you.

93
00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.478
I'm 70 years of age.

94
00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.024
I have terminal cancer.

95
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.028
Incurable. I know it.

96
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.116
I know I'm going to
fight as best as I can.

97
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:53.829
I have a plan to last until
at least January. 2019.

98
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.376
because there is a 40th
anniversary of the Mad Max shoot.

99
00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.921
And we have a big
gathering in Clunes.

100
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.301
Here we go. that's it.

101
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.471
My doctor has
allowed me to do it.

102
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.682
he even reckon it's probably
good for me to fight my cancer.

103
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:18.437
He said that will motivate
you to live and to survive.

104
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.148
as long as you want
to live and survive.

105
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.400
And so far I do.

106
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.779
When the reunion
started to be organised

107
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.782
I wanted to be
there. and I went.

108
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.826
- Mad Max. the movie that
catapulted Mel Gibson to fame.

109
00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.163
is celebrating its 30th
anniversary this weekend.

110
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.540
- And I went to one
of the very first ones.

111
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.793
I think in Little River.

112
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.713
At the time it was
not very popular

113
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.967
and I was one of
the only actors there.

114
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:54.723
This film shot on a shoe
string has developed a cult.

115
00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:58.060
In Italy. in Germany
and in Japan.

116
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.979
in America. I mean everywhere.

117
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:05.192
This is like a tribe. a
sort of a world tribe.

118
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.237
All those people are
extraordinary people.

119
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.240
They are all
incredibly interesting.

120
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.241
Oh God.

121
00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.681
- When I started All
American Pool Service.

122
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.685
I dreamt of working that
job until I was ready to retire

123
00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.397
and then selling the
company and retiring off of that.

124
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.901
I soon learned that that
wasn't particularly realistic.

125
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.655
that's not really how it
works anymore. unfortunately.

126
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.326
So I dissolved that. got rid
of that stress out of my life.

127
00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.246
And Jeff offered me a job here.

128
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:04.586
- He was very forthcoming
with what he did

129
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.880
and if I did something like that

130
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.465
I probably wouldn't
tell anybody.

131
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.758
And I don't.

132
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.852
- You have defied me.

133
00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:26.858
You will know the vengeance
of the Lord Humungus.

134
00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.110
- He was totally comfortable
with it and it's like.

135
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.488
yeah. he's having
fun and good for him.

136
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:35.533
- Nobody gets out of here alive!

137
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.411
- I watched them all
and he loves them.

138
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.790
that's all I can say is.
you know. he loves them.

139
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.667
he was first doing the
Mad Max character.

140
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.920
- I thought he was good
looking enough. you know.

141
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.507
to be a lot better
character than he picked.

142
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:55.094
but he thought Lord
Humungus was neat.

143
00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.516
- When we first got the
house it came with a pool.

144
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.101
which I really didn't
want. but it was there.

145
00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.353
And I come out the door

146
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.730
and my wife's standing
out there with three guys

147
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.399
and there's this hulking
mass of a human.

148
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.528
He's like. here. here. I'm
gonna give these to you.

149
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.863
these are something
I think you'll enjoy.

150
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:18.200
And I'm looking. I'm like.
who's Lord Humungus. right?

151
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.618
And I'm like. this you?

152
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.537
He's like. yeah.

153
00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:21.912
I'm like. holy crap. right.

154
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:26.333
- About 1981 my dad bought
me an issue of Starlog Magazine.

155
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.085
I don't think I ever
read the article.

156
00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.754
but I certainly
looked at the pictures.

157
00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:34.132
Immediately. this was
it. this was all I wanted.

158
00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.759
this was all I watched.

159
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.553
- He was in his room a lot.

160
00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:40.055
- You could turn the volume off

161
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:44.268
and he could tell you
every line in that movie.

162
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.270
He had it all memorised.

163
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.690
- I was a Road
Warrior in my mind.

164
00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:54.278
When I was like 15 years old
I was so deeply into Mad Max.

165
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.321
that that was the
world I wanted to live in.

166
00:10:56.322 --> 00:11:00.284
The cars that I wanted to
drive. the way I wanted to dress.

167
00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.785
And you know. once I
got out of high school

168
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.120
and got into the
punk rock scene.

169
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.372
I did kind of dress
that way a little bit.

170
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.666
- He just was
crazy about the Misfits

171
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.961
when he was 14. 15 years old.

172
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.170
He had the guitar

173
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.632
and he would go out in the
garage and sing and play.

174
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.218
And all the neighbours loved it.

175
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.596
I'm joking.

176
00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.389
The Misfits offered him the job

177
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.182
to sell merchandise on the road

178
00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:27.186
and then it went from
merchandise to the road manager.

179
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.899
He had a ball. he got to see
the whole world effectively.

180
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.818
from Alaska to Moscow.

181
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.615
Everybody got a
nickname on the bus

182
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:44.037
and Jim was a big bodybuilder
and they just called him Tank.

183
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.831
So he's Jim "The Tank" Dorsey.

184
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:51.753
- This is how the
Humungus rolls.

185
00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.756
Once you get started
and you start to see

186
00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.885
and you start to feel some
results. it's very addictive.

187
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.387
You know. once the
shoulders start coming in

188
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.514
and the triceps pop a little bit

189
00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.642
and then you crank the bicep
up and you're just like. oh.

190
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.811
You know. the waist
is coming in tighter.

191
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.188
That's the
inspiration right there.

192
00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.564
that's where the
obsession comes from

193
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.109
because it's like. oh. I
like that. I want more.

194
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.487
- Sensei.

195
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.155
- Yes. sir.

196
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:25.161
Jim came in here. oh. good
lord. probably eight years ago.

197
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.747
He's black belt. as you can see.

198
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.208
and doing quite a good job.

199
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.168
I do remember the
first thing I said to him

200
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.796
when he came in here.
first time he trained was.

201
00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.673
Tank. you gotta get
rid of the muscles.

202
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.257
they're just in your way.

203
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.219
But he didn't and
he's doing fine.

204
00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.766
When he's on the
floor. he's very physical

205
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.518
and you know that if
you can defend yourself

206
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.062
against somebody that's
that big and that strong

207
00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.690
then you're doing
something right.

208
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.818
When I talk about
my karate school.

209
00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.946
I show 'em a picture of Tank
with his massive muscles.

210
00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.366
with some small person on the
ground and they go. oh my God.

211
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.786
But yeah. Tank is a lot of fun.

212
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.421
- Too much is never enough.

213
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.840
I always have that
feeling like there's more.

214
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.634
there's more that I can do.
there's more that I can be.

215
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.136
Yeah. I could put the
Humungus costume on

216
00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.512
and throw the mask on.

217
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:29.141
but if I'm not in shape.
you're not going to believe it.

218
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.269
- Your waist.
- Yeah. yeah. right here.

219
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.771
Where the fat bit is.

220
00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.691
The idea is not to
do an exact replica.

221
00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.527
but to do a. so people. the fan

222
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:45.824
who are die hard Mad Max
fans. they will recognise Clunk.

223
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.076
I'm going to get
another set of boots.

224
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.120
hopefully the same type.

225
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.750
And the red bit here.

226
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.629
because all this is
what people remember.

227
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:04.134
My role in Mad
Max was very small.

228
00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.929
being one of the
Toecutter gang members.

229
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.724
Now we all say the same thing.

230
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:14.978
I never thought that 40 years
later I would be remembered.

231
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.730
let alone talked about.

232
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:17.815
Look at that.

233
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.818
Good for them. you
know. like good for them.

234
00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.614
As he said. it beats
cleaning swimming pools.

235
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.449
- The first time I
went over to his house

236
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.952
is kind of when I really started
to appreciate his passion

237
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.079
when I saw his costumes

238
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.122
and just the stuff
that was in there.

239
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.167
- Well. my wall of fame. if
I had to venture to guess.

240
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:41.129
probably started about
four years ago. maybe 2015.

241
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.425
The first guy I ever met was
Garret Graham who played Beef

242
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:48.637
in Phantom of the Paradise.

243
00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.222
Each one of these
was really cool

244
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.516
to get the reaction
from each actor

245
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.560
who played the
characters that I cosplay.

246
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.437
But number one and the one

247
00:14:57.438 --> 00:15:00.440
that I was the most
nervous going in

248
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.194
was meeting Kjell Nilsson.
the original Lord Humungus.

249
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.280
I was nervous about
how he was going to take

250
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.323
my portrayal of the character.

251
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.242
whether he thought
I did a good job of it.

252
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:14.121
'Cause this is. this is a
world-class athlete bodybuilder

253
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:18.542
in his prime where this is
just some middle-aged fan boy

254
00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.211
trying to recreate something
he sees on a screen.

255
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.296
I didn't want him to think

256
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.589
that I was trying
to steal his thunder

257
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.216
or take over. replace
him or anything like that.

258
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.260
I just wanted them to feel

259
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:32.222
that I did his character
justice and he did.

260
00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:33.807
he was proud of me.

261
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:37.602
He said. you are the next
generation of this evil character.

262
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.021
And that really meant a lot.

263
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.356
How is it?

264
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.357
Chocolatey?
- Good.

265
00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:45.945
- Can you ever
eat more than one?

266
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:47.905
- No.
- Probably not.

267
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:50.615
- Probably not. well daddy
makes some pretty thick pancakes.

268
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:54.995
I've often wondered if other
dads. you know. my age.

269
00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.080
mid forties. think of what I do

270
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.249
as being like
immature or childish.

271
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.667
because it doesn't
seem like something

272
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.210
a normal adult would do.

273
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.005
is make these
costumes and dress up.

274
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.549
- Viola!

275
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.760
- Look at that.

276
00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.555
That's magnifique. magnifique.

277
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.183
And you managed
even to do the red bit.

278
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.602
- Well. we were saying
the plastic would be too hard

279
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:19.853
for the driving and everything.

280
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.564
- Yeah. yeah.
no. no. this is fine.

281
00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.984
I am impressed.

282
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.070
- All right. let's try it on.
- Yeah!

283
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:55.555
I know at my age
and in my condition.

284
00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:59.309
I will never. ever in
my life. what's left of it.

285
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.189
I have an opportunity to
have another trip like this.

286
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.043
- I've always
been a daydreamer.

287
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:29.965
I've always wanted to live in
another time or another place

288
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.175
being another character.

289
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.596
Getting the opportunity
to be a different person.

290
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.768
But for so many years. decades.

291
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:45.564
I thought I was the only
person who was into Mad Max.

292
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:44.790
- I thought it would be much
smaller. but I don't know.

293
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.878
it's like I have
nothing else to do.

294
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:54.007
I never worked a regular
job in my entire life.

295
00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.760
I just do illustrations
or stuff like that

296
00:18:56.761 --> 00:19:00.431
and sometimes I can earn
money from the things I'm doing.

297
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.727
My Mad Max stuff
cost me everything.

298
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.521
All my time and all
the money I can make.

299
00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:12.567
- He's just speaking
about Mad Max every time

300
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.904
that I think. this
is the Mad Melvin.

301
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:20.033
- I started to collect stuff about
Mad Max when I was a kid.

302
00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:23.745
after I saw the
movie the first time.

303
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:27.957
10 years ago I had
like a handful of stuff

304
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.667
and I thought that it was enough

305
00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:33.421
to start to work
on a small book.

306
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.757
But 10 years after my collection

307
00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:38.760
went a little bit
out of control.

308
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:43.890
I began to pick articles.
magazines. records.

309
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:48.396
and every material I could
find that was Mad Max related.

310
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:54.567
My idea is to collect
every original item.

311
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:58.488
I have books and
papers. and pictures.

312
00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:01.199
press pictures
and stuff like this.

313
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.536
I have a ton.

314
00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.205
- Well. this is my
Mad Max collection.

315
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.666
at least for the first movie.

316
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.584
I don't know what possesses me

317
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.129
to pick out a particular
item that I look for on eBay.

318
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.881
I guess those were
the things that I just

319
00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:21.010
thought I could find and sure
enough I tracked them down.

320
00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:24.139
Alpine Stars high point
motocross boots are not cheap.

321
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.015
especially to find them

322
00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.058
with the proper heavy
lug on the. on the sole.

323
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.476
- It never occurred to me

324
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.771
that somebody would
go to all the trouble

325
00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.650
to acquire some of the
props that were used

326
00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:39.320
or to build their own props.

327
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.239
- The first thing that I
remember that he showed me

328
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.244
was he made the dog food.
the food that Mad Max ate.

329
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.164
and then he
replicated the labels

330
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.543
on a can of hash or something
and he was so proud of that.

331
00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:56.963
- Those are the most
accurate ones ever made.

332
00:20:56.964 --> 00:21:00.049
When I first got a copy of
the Blu-ray of Road Warrior

333
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.428
I took it to my friend Tim's
house with a 95 inch screen

334
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:07.015
and I took that scene frame
by frame and dissected it.

335
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.725
And that was when I found out

336
00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.978
that the circle that
says 800 grams in it

337
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.688
is actually a starburst.

338
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.315
- And he goes. I
want you to know.

339
00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.358
everything in this
room is screen accurate.

340
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.195
I'm like. I realize. okay. I'm
gonna screw with him now.

341
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.113
So I'm looking
at 'em like. well.

342
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.615
you know. I'm sorry
to disagree with you.

343
00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.909
I'm gonna call a little
bullshit on this one. but this.

344
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.703
I distinctly remember
the slight scratch near the.

345
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.580
you know. like the trigger here.

346
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.999
And he like leaps
up out of his desk

347
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.084
and he's like. whoa.
wait a minute. wait.

348
00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:35.961
And he's like looking at it
and he's like picking it up.

349
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.462
He's like. no. no. I'm
pretty sure that's right.

350
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.380
I'm like. dude. I don't know.

351
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.633
And he's ready to
like pop the DVD in.

352
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:45.720
- It's hard work finding
the actual screen accurate

353
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:49.724
baseball face masks or
the five draw telescope

354
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.643
as opposed to the
standard four draw.

355
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.852
- Dude. I don't even know

356
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.354
what the hell half
this shit is. okay.

357
00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.566
- Anybody who's into
it knows you nailed it.

358
00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:04.614
- I spent 10 years in
underwear behind my computer

359
00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:06.866
searching for items on eBay.

360
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:12.038
searching for articles.
searching for magazines.

361
00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.124
- When he's working on something

362
00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:18.586
he's working on it really hard

363
00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:22.423
and speaking
about it every time.

364
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:27.470
- In my Mad Max folder
it's around 15.000 pictures.

365
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:31.808
scans of articles.

366
00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:33.851
Mostly scans of articles.

367
00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:38.606
The biggest task was to read
them all and it took me years.

368
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.484
Actually really years.

369
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:47.866
I think the Holy Grail for
me is a Mad Max 1 script.

370
00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:53.289
And I got it from
Bertrand Cadart.

371
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:02.171
- Have you heard
of Mad Max before?

372
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.631
Yeah?

373
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.133
Don't tell me you watched it.

374
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.509
- Yeah. I have.

375
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.262
You're too bloody young!

376
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:10.763
What about you. young man?

377
00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:13.308
You should not. you're only 14.

378
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.769
when it was released
you had to be 16 to see it.

379
00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:21.400
Let alone this little bloke.

380
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:26.279
- I was just about to turn
14 and this movie came out

381
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.575
and it's rated over 18
in France so I thought.

382
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.827
well. I've got to see this.

383
00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:34.871
We just snuck in
to the movie theatre

384
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.873
so we didn't get caught

385
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:40.252
and I remember being
petrified watching the scenes.

386
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.840
We talked about
it at school and.

387
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:47.592
mates would say. oh.
you see that movie?

388
00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:49.636
It's filmed in Australia.

389
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.387
I thought. wow. Australia.

390
00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:54.224
I ended up on the Sunshine
Coast because of Mad Max.

391
00:23:56.477 --> 00:24:00.563
When I first met Bertrand
he came here as a customer

392
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:02.440
and I didn't even know
who he was. you know.

393
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.901
and then he said. oh.
you've seen Mad Max?

394
00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:07.570
And my wife is rolls
her eyes. as usual.

395
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:10.031
don't get my husband
getting to start about Mad Max

396
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:12.909
because he'll never stop.

397
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.161
And then he told me who we was.

398
00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:18.164
- There is a big bloke that
goes on the roof of the car

399
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:20.250
with a mighty crowbar.

400
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.586
You're looking at
the crowbar man.

401
00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:24.837
- You're the crowbar man?

402
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:26.756
- I am the crowbar man.

403
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:29.801
I am the crowbar man.
- Bullshit.

404
00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:34.807
- I say. you betcha I remember.
the crowbar. yeah. wow.

405
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.227
I went and watched
everything. all the scenes

406
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:42.647
where I can see him and
then all my mates in France.

407
00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:43.482
they're just gonna freak.

408
00:24:43.483 --> 00:24:46.235
it's just like. I'm gonna be
a rockstar now. you know.

409
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.459
- With Mad Max people would
sit at the end of the screening

410
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.837
and just sit and try to recover

411
00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:08.673
from the previous 100 minutes.

412
00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.925
There were a lot
of mild films around

413
00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:13.636
so this Mad Max stood out.

414
00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:16.139
We knew we had
something that was going to

415
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.224
impact on audiences.

416
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.143
- For me. it was
all about the cars.

417
00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:23.438
the Aussie classic muscle cars.

418
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.773
And especially the
black Interceptor.

419
00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:26.941
Was always a favourite of mine.

420
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:29.277
you can never get sick of it.

421
00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:32.822
- When they went
to the drive in 1979.

422
00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:35.617
we see on the screen were
cars that they actually owned.

423
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.538
Monaros. Falcons. HJ panel vans.

424
00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:46.711
- Everyone has a story about
their car or their family car.

425
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:50.089
And it stays with them.
it's something you'd never.

426
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.550
well I don't think
I'll ever forget

427
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.178
'cause my dad loved his cars.

428
00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.930
It had to be a V8
and we all loved it

429
00:25:57.931 --> 00:26:00.975
being revved up
after a drink at the pub

430
00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.019
and driving home
from the tennis club

431
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.606
and whose dad could
outdo whose dad with the V8.

432
00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:12.069
- Over 10 years ago I
decided to build myself

433
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.364
a Mad Max black
on black Interceptor.

434
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:19.619
It took me seven long
years to find the parts.

435
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.788
figure out how it
all bolts together.

436
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:26.250
and then finally I
put the wheel flares

437
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.336
and the nose cone
and the roof spoiler on

438
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:32.215
and molded it all in and
gave her a shot of high fill

439
00:26:32.216 --> 00:26:33.966
and then chiseled her
back to her straight lines

440
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:38.055
and then hit her with some
black and here it is today.

441
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.520
I use it to go down and
get my lottery on a Sunday.

442
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.690
It's not something I just
want to put away and stare at.

443
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:52.151
it's something that I
want to use and enjoy.

444
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.862
And I do really enjoy it.

445
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:49.959
- When I first arrived in
Australia on a motorcycle

446
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.837
I never thought
in a million years

447
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.464
that I would live here.

448
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:59.093
I was bumming around
the world on a motorcycle

449
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.970
trying to have a good time.

450
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:04.141
And waiting for life
to give me opportunity.

451
00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:10.730
And I discovered
this immensity of land.

452
00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:13.734
Roads with no end.

453
00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:18.905
At the time was not many
police and a lot less people.

454
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:20.616
it was in the early seventies.

455
00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:25.828
You could open the
throttle of your motorcycle.

456
00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:29.707
go as fast as bloody thing
would go for 200 kilometres

457
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.252
without seeing one single house.

458
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:36.047
That worked for me.

459
00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:43.679
I decided to customise
Japanese bikes.

460
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.474
which nobody was
doing in Australia.

461
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:49.936
I did that with a
couple of French friends

462
00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.562
and we had to learn everything.

463
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:54.523
We had to buy a book.
how to laminate fiberglass.

464
00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:55.525
We knew nothing.

465
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.821
And no one wanted
to buy our stuff.

466
00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:04.283
it was just. come on. you know.

467
00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:09.289
We are real bikers here.
we want a crust of a dead fly

468
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:12.960
on our Belstaff jacket.

469
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.713
At the same time. George Miller

470
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:22.802
was trying to convince people
to help him shoot his film.

471
00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:25.096
Nobody believed in George

472
00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:27.182
as much as they
didn't believe in me.

473
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.269
So I had all those fairings
dangling in the shops

474
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.064
and when George sort of
approached those people to say.

475
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.400
look. I need someone
to customise bikes

476
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:42.113
that we got from Kawasaki to
look as futuristic as possible.

477
00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:43.990
One of the dealer said. look.

478
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:46.993
there is one guy that
might be able to help you.

479
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.661
Here is his number.

480
00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:51.080
We made absolutely
no money out of it.

481
00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:54.375
The price was
probably below cost.

482
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:57.503
Eventually George
one day said to me.

483
00:29:57.504 --> 00:30:01.632
would you like
a part in the film?

484
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:05.928
I said to him. but what
about my accent. you know?

485
00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.348
He said. it's all right.
you don't say anything.

486
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:15.104
- This here is
my original script.

487
00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:20.443
My wife read this
and she was horrified.

488
00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:22.361
And I said well. what's
so crazy about it?

489
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:25.031
And because my English
was not good enough

490
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:27.491
to understand what was written.

491
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.785
she said. you have no idea

492
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:31.621
what you're
getting yourself into.

493
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:37.753
I never thought that 40
years later I still would have it.

494
00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:44.760
We are doing these trips
for me as a pilgrimage

495
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:47.554
back to where we shot the film.

496
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.807
It means a lot to me
to do this after 40 years.

497
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.552
Who is there?

498
00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:31.680
This is Clunk!

499
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:43.068
Every year in Japan
you do Mad Max festival.

500
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.697
- Yes. yes. yes.
- Yes?

501
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.243
Look. this is crazy.

502
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:29.835
- I felt like a pop singer.
I felt like the Beatles.

503
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.963
- They were not afraid
to show their emotions.

504
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.923
Some of them
were almost in tears.

505
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.967
in fact. not almost. in tears.

506
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:40.137
- They were actually falling
against me. crying on my chest.

507
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.349
Just falling on you.
just sobbing. you know.

508
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.268
- Saying. I cannot
believe you are here.

509
00:35:46.269 --> 00:35:47.561
- You thought. oh
my God. you know.

510
00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:49.480
for God's sake. get off me!

511
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.900
But inwardly I
loved it. you know.

512
00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:54.902
I'll be walking down the street

513
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:57.863
and all of a sudden I'll hear
somebody's voice in my ear.

514
00:35:57.864 --> 00:36:01.992
"You and me. Max. we're
gonna give 'em back their heroes."

515
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.580
What that hell. people
are quoting my lines.

516
00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:09.416
There are fans all
around the world.

517
00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:13.379
I went on my honeymoon to Sri
Lanka. a young waiter come up.

518
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.965
He said. excuse me. sir.
what is your good name?

519
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.301
I said. my name is Roger Ward.

520
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:22.888
Oh. very famous name
here. sir. very famous name.

521
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:26.225
I said. I think you're
thinking of Roger Moore.

522
00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:28.560
Oh no. no. no. Roger
Moore. he was a saint.

523
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:33.273
He was James Bond. no.
no. you were Fifi in Mad Max!

524
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:34.274
Oh my God.

525
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.153
You know. you get
that all around the world.

526
00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:42.449
Just people identify
with that and with you

527
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.742
as if we're all one.

528
00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:46.912
That's ridiculous. I
know. but I love it.

529
00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:49.415
- If you're not moved by that

530
00:36:49.416 --> 00:36:53.752
then I think you're a
bit of a cynical bastard

531
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:56.713
who should have a long.
hard look at themselves.

532
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.716
- Jim Goose.

533
00:36:58.925 --> 00:36:59.925
Fifi.

534
00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.680
And Johnny the Boy.

535
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.184
- Donuts. donuts.
- No donuts.

536
00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:51.727
Here are the donuts.

537
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:54.688
Bit more. maybe here.

538
00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:55.815
Yeah. maybe here.

539
00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.403
- Yoshi bought a bike off
eBay from South Australia.

540
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.989
He paid good money for
it and it got to my place.

541
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.577
it was a piece of.
won't say any more.

542
00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:11.747
The rims were rusted out.
spokes were broken and missing.

543
00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:14.249
Broken piston. wheel
bearings were shot.

544
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.376
all the brakes had seized.

545
00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:19.046
The thing was the
biggest pile of crap

546
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:21.173
I've ever had in my shed.

547
00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:25.552
So that's what we started
with. and away we went.

548
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.978
- I've built
many. many Kawasaki's.

549
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.855
I can't tell you how
many I've done.

550
00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:39.691
Hundreds of them.
it's been an addiction.

551
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:42.444
I've owned well over a 1.000.

552
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:45.072
I'm nuts on Kwakas. that's it.

553
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.865
I'm quackers over Kwakas.

554
00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:52.246
It was successfully completed

555
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:57.252
and soon after they
found Dale's original bike.

556
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.840
They're both here
today. they look fabulous.

557
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:07.427
- Well. this one belongs
to Yoshi from Japan

558
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.221
and he leaves this in Australia.

559
00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:10.430
- What?

560
00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:11.473
- The bike.

561
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.351
- Oh. yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

562
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.812
- This is the original
bike that I owned.

563
00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:18.939
I was the first owner.

564
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.567
Whoa. clutch is not real good.

565
00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:24.529
There've been five
owners of it now.

566
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:31.201
I sold it in about '79.
but in 1994 for its class

567
00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.829
it established the
land speed record.

568
00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:39.460
142 point something
miles per hour.

569
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:42.254
So that's another little piece

570
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:44.340
of very interesting
history of this bike.

571
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.385
- He always comes up to my place

572
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.721
because now his
spare bike is kept there

573
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.016
and he collects
it and off he goes.

574
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.812
And only found
out last week that

575
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.898
he's got another
burnout bike in Japan.

576
00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.192
That was a surprise to me.

577
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:19.018
- Beautiful.

578
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.653
So when did you build
this. how long ago?

579
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:30.654
- 15 years.

580
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:35.367
But it's old now. it over
heats and sucks a lot of petrol.

581
00:41:35.368 --> 00:41:39.955
- You tell me. my
Trans Am is just as bad.

582
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:51.342
- Hey. Clunk!
- Yeah!

583
00:41:56.264 --> 00:41:57.807
Long life to Clunk!

584
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.844
What a ride.

585
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:40.307
- Thanks. cobber.

586
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:45.687
- Yeah. sure. I'd be happy to.
- Thank you so much.

587
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:49.816
- Thank you for coming.
I really appreciate it.

588
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:52.695
How are you doing?

589
00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.237
How was your night last night?

590
00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.032
- Is this the most fans
you've ever seen in one place?

591
00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:58.451
- Yes.

592
00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:04.206
- The vehicle is a mid 70s
F100 I built from ground up.

593
00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:05.290
built it on pictures.

594
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.585
the original pictures
from the movie vehicle.

595
00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:11.213
And it's probably
one of the most

596
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:14.634
reliable vehicle I've
built. it goes and stops.

597
00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.764
The special features are
really the flame throwers.

598
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.561
If we all did the same thing.

599
00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:29.190
life's pretty boring
sometimes. isn't it. you know?

600
00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:34.194
- My name is Bill Hatzigiannis.

601
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.947
I run a small
business on Facebook.

602
00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:41.493
Steel Edge Constructions.
where I create model cars.

603
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:45.163
I'd never seen a coupe with
that sort of body structure.

604
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:48.166
I'd never seen any of
the vehicles. motorbikes.

605
00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:51.753
looking as tough as they were
on the actual Mad Max movie.

606
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:54.005
My son loves vehicles.
he's a motorhead.

607
00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:56.299
no influence of mine whatsoever.

608
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.927
But yeah. like I'm hoping
that he'll be able to carry

609
00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:00.596
the Mad Max tradition on.

610
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:03.557
Just awesome that there's
other people out there

611
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:07.727
that really enjoy it as much
as I do and my family does.

612
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:09.187
- Seeing all these
replica vehicles

613
00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:12.274
and the guys that like
spend their last dime

614
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:13.942
to put these vehicles together.

615
00:44:13.943 --> 00:44:15.610
I understand that passion.

616
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:16.945
if I had more dimes to spend

617
00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:18.864
I'd be doing the
same damn thing.

618
00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:22.284
- Gidday. welcome
to the Mad Max event.

619
00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.664
This is the biggest
convention of Mad Max actors

620
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:30.166
since 1979 movie release

621
00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.043
and they're here in one
spot and they're here.

622
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:33.295
and this won't happen again.

623
00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:35.338
Make the most of
it. it's a one-off day

624
00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.382
and we're gonna bloody enjoy it.

625
00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:41.219
Let's talk to the actors.
we'll go through one by one.

626
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.471
Vince Gill. the Nightrider!

627
00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:48.643
- Thank you. ladies
and gentlemen.

628
00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:51.313
- It just overwhelms me.

629
00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:54.357
this movie and the
love you all have for it.

630
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.151
Thank you so much.

631
00:44:56.152 --> 00:44:59.070
And to think that we're all
still here like 40 years later

632
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:01.573
and once we were young too.

633
00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:04.117
- Who would've thought
40 years down the road.

634
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.329
thought everyone
had forgotten about us.

635
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:10.206
But apparently not.

636
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:13.084
- You couldn't do
this in America.

637
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:17.047
they would arrest every
one of you folks. seriously.

638
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.758
- Who thought the stupid Swede.

639
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:23.303
body builder could come
here and do something like this

640
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:24.804
and still here.

641
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.852
- Remember the crowbar man?
- Yeah!

642
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.229
- I am the crowbar man!

643
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:36.191
- Just remember who was the guy

644
00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:37.984
they nearly hit with a crowbar

645
00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.486
and they nearly hit with the axe

646
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:41.155
and they nearly
dropped the bike on.

647
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:44.866
As you know it
wasn't a huge budget

648
00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:46.910
so none of us got
paid very much.

649
00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:49.287
But we were young. we
were inventive. we were keen.

650
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:52.165
and I think we
contributed to the world

651
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:55.377
as far as how to make
movies and action movies.

652
00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:56.795
- I can tell a bunch of stories.

653
00:45:56.796 --> 00:45:59.047
but I just want to say something

654
00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:01.925
about this film and
what it means. you know.

655
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:05.095
I grew up in the Southern
Tablelands and when you were 13

656
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:08.014
all you want to do is get on
the road and get out of there

657
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.141
and there was garages
around with lots of uncles.

658
00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:14.104
boring out V8s and
trying to find a way

659
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:19.068
to create a sense of
freedom and the road

660
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:21.362
and what was possible.

661
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.447
But what this story also said

662
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.409
was that this story's
about the road.

663
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.036
it's about freedom.
and it's about death.

664
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:33.331
And how we all. all you
people understand that tension

665
00:46:33.332 --> 00:46:34.582
and what that means.

666
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.960
And this is a great
Australian story

667
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:40.463
because you
understand that this film

668
00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:44.259
was about the soul
of part of Australia

669
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.971
that you guys and
women. you all grew up in.

670
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.765
It's a bit tongue in
cheek. it's a bit different.

671
00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:53.101
and the audience for
this film around the world

672
00:46:53.102 --> 00:46:54.853
understand that very well.

673
00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:57.689
And nobody
understands that better

674
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.733
than the people
standing in this crowd

675
00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:02.569
and I just want to say.
I'm proud to meet ya.

676
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:06.406
I hope to shake all your
hands and thank you so much

677
00:47:06.407 --> 00:47:10.410
and don't forget
your part in creating

678
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:13.997
this great myth and
narrative. thanks very much.

679
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:19.127
- When I was first
starting out to ride

680
00:47:19.128 --> 00:47:21.129
I'd be watching Terry Gibson

681
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.174
riding fast on the
Goose bike thinking.

682
00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:26.509
that's how you sit
when you ride fast.

683
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.512
I've always been into stunt
riders and stuff like that.

684
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:34.768
I was amazed by the stunts
that were done in Mad Max.

685
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:38.146
There's that style.
it's raw. it's real.

686
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:56.790
- I'm old school. I'm
one of the very last.

687
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:59.084
Actually someone
introduced me the other day

688
00:47:59.085 --> 00:48:02.712
as being the oldest
stuntman in Australia.

689
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.673
My goal is to be the oldest
stuntman in the world.

690
00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:07.467
- We had this car lying around

691
00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:10.136
and we decided we'd
build it for the anniversary.

692
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:12.263
We were contacted
by the organisers.

693
00:48:12.264 --> 00:48:15.225
as they heard we
may have a vehicle

694
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:18.520
that could be sacrificed
to go through the caravan.

695
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.355
- So the caravan stunt.

696
00:48:20.356 --> 00:48:22.524
I was asked to sort of
come up with the concept

697
00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:27.530
and I wanted to keep it to
the original scale. low budget.

698
00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:36.704
But my idea was to
make it bigger and better.

699
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:40.543
So I decided. well.
two's better than one.

700
00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:46.339
- It's intended life
was as a race car.

701
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.674
which it's still going to do

702
00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:50.093
after it's finished
its job here today.

703
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.970
It just fast-tracked
our build a little quicker

704
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.222
than what we expected.

705
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.933
It was very stressful.
the paint's still wet.

706
00:48:56.934 --> 00:49:00.353
we were still putting it together
at00 AM this morning.

707
00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:04.984
- The biggest problem is
basically the cupboard hardwood

708
00:49:07.403 --> 00:49:11.197
and cabinets. hinges.
sinks and things like that.

709
00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:15.911
You will get stabbed more
than likely from debris like that.

710
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.374
I once had a splinter that
was three metres long.

711
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:24.503
But that's fine. I
just pulled it out.

712
00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:28.548
- Do you want
to jump in and give it a rev?

713
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:30.909
- I'm hoping it'll start. I
think the battery's nearly flat.

714
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:42.896
- I'm old school. no smoke
and mirrors. no cameras.

715
00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:43.897
You can't cheat.

716
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.777
We're not going high-tech.

717
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:52.071
We're keeping it grassroots

718
00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:56.367
so even the ramps are
just pretty ramshackle.

719
00:49:56.368 --> 00:50:00.663
My gear is not
megabucks safety here.

720
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:03.876
I've been alive 65 years.
so I can't be too damn bad.

721
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.479
I really hope you enjoyed it!

722
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.606
- Yes. excellent job. Rob.

723
00:51:08.607 --> 00:51:12.528
- I've just made history. that
has never been done before!

724
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.364
And I never practiced.

725
00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:20.618
If anybody's interested
in some of the shrapnel.

726
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:21.996
if you wanna collectible.

727
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.415
it'll be available over there
in about a half an hour.

728
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:27.458
- How much
for a piece of caravan?

729
00:51:27.459 --> 00:51:31.379
- You've
done it. you've done it!

730
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.674
You came out all right!
- Haven't lost me touch.

731
00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:51.190
- All right. everyone.
this car's the one

732
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.192
that you were all
asking about before.

733
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:55.903
It's been signed by the actors.

734
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.989
I'm gonna put Bertrand on.

735
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.908
he's gonna tell you
a little bit of a story.

736
00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:04.038
- All right. good evening.

737
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:08.875
I'm sort of okay.
this is why I'm here

738
00:52:08.876 --> 00:52:12.211
and you can see me
with the walking stick.

739
00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:15.381
And the reason why
I have a walking stick

740
00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:20.720
is because I've been
diagnosed with leukaemia.

741
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:24.265
It is fatal and it
can't be cured.

742
00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:28.853
So I decided to come here
with you guys as I am myself.

743
00:52:28.854 --> 00:52:32.565
as you can imagine.
a Mad Max fan.

744
00:52:32.566 --> 00:52:36.819
and I would like to give
some proceed of this auction

745
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.322
to the Leukaemia Foundation.

746
00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:44.410
As much as it is okay
for me to go at 70.

747
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:48.956
I don't think it is okay. I'm
going to become emotional.

748
00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:52.251
I don't think it is okay
for a young person of 25

749
00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:54.587
to die of leukaemia. you know.

750
00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:57.548
and if we could help
them. there you go.

751
00:52:57.549 --> 00:53:00.802
- I will start the
auction at 200 bucks.

752
00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:03.805
so who is going to
go over 200 bucks?

753
00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:05.014
- Come on!
- 250!

754
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.974
- We got 250. 250.

755
00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:08.935
we got a three. we got
a three. we got a three?

756
00:53:08.936 --> 00:53:09.936
We got a three over there.

757
00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:12.772
we got a three. we got a
320. we got a 320. 320?

758
00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:15.525
We got a 320 over
there. we got a 350. 350.

759
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:18.194
350 over there. 400 over here!

760
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:21.406
500 over there. 600 over there.

761
00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:24.784
can we get 650. 650. 650?

762
00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:26.829
- 1.000 - 1.000 over here!

763
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.916
$1.500!

764
00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:38.465
Going. going and. sold!

765
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.520
- I think I'm going
to cry. so thank you.

766
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:56.024
Thank you very much.

767
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.636
- We're up here at
Maryborough. at the racing track.

768
00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:30.391
and the shows over. folks.
and she's 100% snafu.

769
00:54:30.392 --> 00:54:33.895
But we're still here
chipping away. packing up.

770
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:35.522
and still enjoying it.

771
00:54:36.565 --> 00:54:38.232
That's what we come for.

772
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:41.402
- So we got some amazing
memorabilia from the show.

773
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:43.196
which was sensational.

774
00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:47.325
But my two brothers here
got pieces of the caravan

775
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:49.452
with the tire marks on it.

776
00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:52.455
and I think that's
the greatest thing

777
00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:56.084
these blokes can drag out
and show somebody one day.

778
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:16.812
- The first film is
the balls to the wall.

779
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:20.024
skinflint explosion of energy

780
00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:23.529
that is only created when you
kind of have nothing to lose.

781
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:29.075
- I was not
particularly excited to see the film

782
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:31.244
because I thought. my God.
with what we went through.

783
00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:33.497
you know. it's
going to be a flop.

784
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.041
- Even the film crew. I
remember them all mumbling

785
00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:40.378
and cursing and saying.
oh God. it'll never work.

786
00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:42.965
I could hear it. and I'm
sure George could hear it.

787
00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:46.217
- Australia didn't have much

788
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:47.718
in the way of action cinema.

789
00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:52.139
so no one really could
have possibly anticipated

790
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.644
the hell that broke loose when
Mad Max arrived in cinemas.

791
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:03.401
- A lot of people did question

792
00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:05.028
some of the
violence in the film.

793
00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:13.119
- One ABC journalist
actually threw up

794
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.870
during one of the screenings.

795
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:19.250
- The most famous kind
of voice against the film

796
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:20.835
was Phillip Adams.

797
00:56:20.836 --> 00:56:23.045
- He condemned Mad
Max. saying that it had.

798
00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:27.466
quote. all the emotional
uplift of Mein Kampf.

799
00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:30.177
- The film would be
great for future sadists

800
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:34.932
and psychopaths and
pedophiles. which is. you know.

801
00:56:34.933 --> 00:56:36.602
a lot more than a thumbs down.

802
00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:41.856
- The main thing about
Mad Max was word of mouth.

803
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:45.526
Everyone that saw Mad Max
had never seen anything like it.

804
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:47.321
not just as an Australian film.

805
00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:49.780
- Holy shit.

806
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.992
It was an exciting
film to watch.

807
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:55.786
- Standing with George
at the back of the cinema

808
00:56:55.787 --> 00:56:58.664
when the film finished
and the lights came up.

809
00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:01.292
the response was just amazing.

810
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:03.628
Bill Collins wrote that
George Miller has made

811
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:06.047
the most exciting
film of the decade.

812
00:57:06.048 --> 00:57:09.008
- But still. if somebody
then had said

813
00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:11.761
that I was going to
be flown to Japan

814
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:13.638
and treated like a rock star.

815
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.723
I would have
said. you are crazy.

816
00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:17.475
- It really blew everyone away.

817
00:57:17.476 --> 00:57:19.644
What was this
story really about?

818
00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:21.520
Why are people
connecting with it?

819
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:23.189
And so in order to answer

820
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:25.191
some of those
questions for himself.

821
00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:29.570
George Miller started investigating
Joseph Campbell's work.

822
00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:33.115
- We finally found Joseph
Campbell or his writings.

823
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.742
do you know who
Joseph Campbell is?

824
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:36.869
- Campbell's work goes back to

825
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:39.288
pictures on the side of caves.

826
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:42.291
So while we look at
Mad Max and we say.

827
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.793
this is an astonishing film.

828
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:45.544
we've never seen
this film before.

829
00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:47.505
it didn't just come
from nowhere.

830
00:57:47.506 --> 00:57:50.299
It came from recurring
patterns of narratives

831
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.343
that began 40.000 years ago.

832
00:57:52.344 --> 00:57:54.512
- The person who alerted
everyone to Campbell

833
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:56.806
more than anyone
else was George Lucas.

834
00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:58.599
From A Hero with
a Thousand Faces.

835
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.018
he based the Star Wars sagas.

836
00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.812
They all dressed
in different clothes

837
00:58:02.813 --> 00:58:04.355
but the essential themes

838
00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:07.024
and the essential
experiences come through.

839
00:58:07.025 --> 00:58:08.651
- When the mythology is alive

840
00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:11.779
you don't have to tell
anybody what it means.

841
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.572
It's like looking at a picture

842
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:16.742
that's really talking
to you. it gets to you.

843
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:20.413
- The success of
Mad Max in Japan.

844
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:23.082
prompted Warner
Brothers in the States

845
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:26.627
to take another look at it
and give it a bit more backing.

846
00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:29.255
And that's what enabled
it to get off the ground.

847
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:31.132
- It was
really a turning point

848
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:33.259
for modern Australian cinema.

849
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.762
- In Road Warrior
we attempted to be

850
00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:39.223
much more consciously
mythological.

851
00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:54.530
- Every year. hundreds.
if not thousands.

852
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.616
I'm not sure of the
figures. of Mad Max

853
00:58:57.617 --> 00:59:02.622
dedicated true blue fans
come from all over the world

854
00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:05.667
to Broken Hill and Silverton.

855
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:10.671
This was the best
possible location

856
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:13.175
for the filming of Mad Max 2.

857
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:20.181
Silverton is a place a
Mad Max fan must attend.

858
00:59:20.182 --> 00:59:25.145
he must attend that. and
so this is where we're going.

859
00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:34.487
- A friend of mine told
me. oh. Broken Hill.

860
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:36.489
it's the gate of the desert.

861
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.866
But when I get there. I said.

862
00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.743
this is not the
gate of the desert.

863
00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:42.912
this is the fucking desert.

864
00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:44.790
I was overwhelmed.

865
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.586
I found it was really.
really beautiful.

866
00:59:51.338 --> 00:59:53.714
If you go there. you
understand right away

867
00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.591
why you want to shoot there

868
00:59:55.592 --> 01:00:00.305
because it's like an
Australian Monument Valley.

869
01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.934
In France and Europe.
everything is tiny and dense

870
01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:09.231
and I suddenly discovered
empty spaces and a remote place.

871
01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:15.319
- It's a cult following now for
Mad Max and Bertrand Cadart

872
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.823
is the man that played
Clunk in Mad Max 1.

873
01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:21.201
he joins me this morning.
Bertrand good morning.

874
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.746
- Mad Max 2 is really
the decay of society

875
01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:30.584
and all its props is now
well and truly on the way

876
01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.087
to nothingness.

877
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.677
- I came to Silverton in
1973 and bought the pub

878
01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:42.930
and shortly after
that various film crews

879
01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:44.641
started rolling into town.

880
01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:55.943
- It was still dirt roads
coming into the place.

881
01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:59.697
You always saw people
broken down with the bonnets up.

882
01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.199
- When they were
filming Razorback.

883
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.160
they made the pub look
absolutely disgusting.

884
01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.996
the outside of it.

885
01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.416
When cars would drive
past they wouldn't pull up.

886
01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:13.878
- Probably up until then

887
01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:17.047
we'd never ever seen a
drag queen in Broken Hill.

888
01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.674
We've had some famous
people through here.

889
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.802
- I had copies of
them all on videos.

890
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.805
but they've been
damaged with heat

891
01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.016
and they don't work anymore.

892
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:30.060
- A lot of movies have
come here for the outback.

893
01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:31.563
Though Mad Max is the main one.

894
01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.192
- I think everybody got
paid 20 bucks a day more

895
01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.821
if they had a mohawk.
more than the other extras.

896
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:44.408
People were a bit shy about
having a mohawk to start with

897
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.035
but it wasn't long before

898
01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.579
there were a lot of
mohawks around town.

899
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.290
- And we thought. gee. what's
going on here. you know?

900
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.959
- I can remember waking
up early one morning

901
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.003
and I looked out
through the side window

902
01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.422
and there's this
bloke walking around

903
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.716
in all this leather gear
and feathers hanging off

904
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.968
and the cheeks of
his arse hanging out

905
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:05.554
and I just couldn't believe it.

906
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.641
I thought. oh
God. this is weird.

907
01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:10.894
I got quite a shock

908
01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:14.064
when I looked out the
window and saw that.

909
01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.902
- In behind Yoshi there a bit.

910
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:23.530
For decades in
my group of friends.

911
01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:28.536
I was like the only person
who loved Mad Max.

912
01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:35.000
Come up a bit more
behind Nick here.

913
01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:38.629
Nobody else got it.
nobody else was into it.

914
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:43.384
And then to discover there
is an international community

915
01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:47.721
of cosplayers and vehicle
enthusiasts and Mad Max freaks.

916
01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.848
It's like. holy shit!

917
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.059
- And I couldn't believe it

918
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.688
when they started coming
here for these reunions.

919
01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:56.855
- The Silverton Collective

920
01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.774
started many. many years ago.

921
01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.693
Being a collective

922
01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:02.528
everyone's just basically
doing their own thing.

923
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.905
having their own
particular fun way

924
01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.157
of looking at everything.

925
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:12.454
- Coming to Silverton. for
me it's like sacred ground.

926
01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.332
Just knowing that the
movie was made here.

927
01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:18.795
- Yoshi comes over here.
Tank comes over from America.

928
01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.845
And Melvin comes from
France. it's a universal movie.

929
01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:36.478
- You are 14 years old
and you discover the movie

930
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.690
for the first time in your
life in a movie theatre

931
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:44.820
full with strange guys in
leather and crazy haircuts.

932
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.072
That was like. awesome.

933
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:50.576
Three. two. one.

934
01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:53.787
- The people that are around
that come and see them

935
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.706
and they think. oh
geez. what are we doing.

936
01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:56.582
filming another Mad Max?

937
01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:00.377
- Little children sometimes
are a little bit scared of it.

938
01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:03.047
I have to walk up to
them and go really gently.

939
01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.174
look I'm a nice
person. it's okay.

940
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.051
- I guess you could say
I'm a little intimidating

941
01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.135
just due to my size.

942
01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.471
I'm a nice guy. but
people don't get that

943
01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.680
until they get to know me.

944
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:14.391
- I'm trying to calm them
down and the parents are like.

945
01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.353
yeah. yeah. scare them
more. scare them more.

946
01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.944
- I feel like I'm at home
with all the other crazies.

947
01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:27.447
It's like coming to Mecca.

948
01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:33.453
- I'm Michael. Stacie.
my daughter. Josh. Cody.

949
01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.829
Family trip.

950
01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:39.041
- Well. it's been
the trip of a lifetime really.

951
01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:43.754
Like traveling back to
Silverton from Maryborough

952
01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:47.216
in a big convoy
of about 12 cars.

953
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.927
that was one of the best
experiences I've ever had.

954
01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:52.387
- I'm like my
father in many ways.

955
01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.681
just looking at the
old cars and stuff

956
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:58.894
and helping out
and all that so yeah.

957
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:02.899
- 'Cause I needed all
the drivers too. hang on.

958
01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:07.112
So yeah. so I needed
a back up vehicle.

959
01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.490
Joshua brought the Griffin car.

960
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.660
and he's our little navigator.

961
01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.955
And it's just awesome. you
can go out to the scenes out here

962
01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.666
and it's exactly
like in the movie.

963
01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.967
When I hit the
Mundi Mundi plains.

964
01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:33.679
go on over the hill and down.
you know. it's just awesome.

965
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.431
Just like on the movie.

966
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.942
- I've always been more
a loner you might say.

967
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.569
rather than big groups.

968
01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.489
I don't know what drives
people to get together like that.

969
01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.949
Really.

970
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.950
- Hundreds tonight.

971
01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.703
I've never seen the lookout
as busy as it is tonight.

972
01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.707
It's just phenomenal.
the crowds. the cars.

973
01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.502
- You can stand
on the spot and go.

974
01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:09.256
shit. that rock looks like
it was still in the movie.

975
01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:20.559
- I think it just captures
a bit of a dreamtime

976
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.436
for a lot of Australians

977
01:06:21.437 --> 01:06:24.439
how they would like to
play and live their life.

978
01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.358
Anything to do with
wheels and motors

979
01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:31.445
is always a popular
thing with guys.

980
01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.030
- Off the road.

981
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.823
Get off the road!

982
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.125
- Back in the day. those
cars were on the road for us.

983
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.668
We'd like to catch
the bus to school

984
01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.711
and be looking out the window

985
01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:50.589
and you see all these cars
that could have been in Mad Max

986
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.009
and yeah. we just
loved those cars.

987
01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.348
- Mid-seventies. petrol
had been hugely cheap.

988
01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.642
- And my car
needed so much of it

989
01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.811
that I was continually
running out of petrol.

990
01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.147
- Young men could
quite simply go out

991
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:11.818
and buy themselves a ridiculously
overpowered automobile.

992
01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:16.073
And the sense of freedom
you get from that was massive.

993
01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.200
And then there
was the oil crisis.

994
01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.744
- This may be the worst
weekend they've ever faced

995
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.789
for finding gasoline to give
them the automobile freedom

996
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.082
they take as their due.

997
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.918
- You had these
incredible automobiles

998
01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.128
that sucked a huge
amount of juice

999
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.882
and all of a sudden petrol
wasn't cheap anymore.

1000
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.678
- Big V8s and the like were
just cut up and got rid of

1001
01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:38.929
because it looked
as though the fuel

1002
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.391
was going to keep on
getting more expensive.

1003
01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:43.767
- I remember being
told things like.

1004
01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:47.020
fuel is going to run out
in two. maybe three years.

1005
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:50.482
- When we had fuel rationing
we saw what started to happen

1006
01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.401
after about three or four days.

1007
01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.486
- I will not take the
blame for this thing.

1008
01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.238
I will not take the crap
and the harassment

1009
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.073
from these customers.

1010
01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:59.700
- Why didn't they come out
and tell us there was no gas?

1011
01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:02.577
- Lives were
disrupted by something as simple

1012
01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.830
as not having enough
fuel to run their cars.

1013
01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:08.959
- When Mad Max came
out it kind of crystallised.

1014
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.086
oh this is what
it could look like.

1015
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.423
We'd see a breakdown in
order and chaos would ensue.

1016
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.508
Gangs would take
over the highway.

1017
01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.970
- Timing of Max and
the timing of that whole

1018
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:22.973
car culture. power
high-octane thing

1019
01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:27.227
was right in the sweet spot
to create even more reverence

1020
01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:32.316
to these beautifully illogical
overpowered vehicles.

1021
01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.452
- I remember when
I first arrived here

1022
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.829
for the first time in 2004.

1023
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.915
we came over the brow of
the hill and just parked up here.

1024
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.543
I got goosebumps. the hairs
went up on the back of my neck.

1025
01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.503
it was just
absolutely incredible.

1026
01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:57.007
It just felt. well for me.
it felt like I'd come home.

1027
01:08:57.008 --> 01:09:00.302
I was so familiar with
seeing this place in the movie.

1028
01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.179
Just absolutely incredible.

1029
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.264
- We actually call
Adrian Mad Max

1030
01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.683
because he thinks he's Mad Max.

1031
01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.353
He dresses like Mad Max.
got a dog like Mad Max.

1032
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.480
he does everything Mad Max.

1033
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.231
I think he eats dog
food and all that.

1034
01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.776
- I remember sitting
at the kitchen table.

1035
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.319
I had my head in my
hands. I was like this.

1036
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.571
and my mum came and she said.

1037
01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:20.947
is everything all right. you
know. is everything okay?

1038
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:25.202
And I said. Mum. you
know. I've just been to see

1039
01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:28.539
two of the most extraordinary
films that I've ever seen.

1040
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:31.917
And that was the start
that set me on this quest

1041
01:09:31.918 --> 01:09:35.004
to find out more and more
about these incredible movies.

1042
01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:40.426
To me. Mad Max 2 was film
perfection. it was flawless.

1043
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.390
The first thing I wanted to
do was see if I can find a car.

1044
01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:48.475
which I did. I found an
Aussie coupe in Texas.

1045
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:50.727
funnily enough.
and I bought the car

1046
01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:54.481
and over the next 18 months
turned into the Interceptor.

1047
01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.988
I think at the time I was
the only person in Europe

1048
01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:04.700
that had one of these
replicas and I was happy.

1049
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.287
But I knew that there was
something more I needed to do.

1050
01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.997
something else I wanted to do.

1051
01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.834
My future plans including
the family and the car.

1052
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:16.461
is moving to Australia to live.

1053
01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.964
I actually said to
my wife. Linda. I said.

1054
01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.925
do you think you
could live there?

1055
01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:26.054
Well thinking it would never
happen. she actually said yes.

1056
01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.598
you know. just to
kind of pacify me.

1057
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.310
I've been with Linda
now for 35 years

1058
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.105
and our first date was
actually taking her to the cinema

1059
01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:37.023
to see Mad Max 1 and 2.

1060
01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.025
But I don't really think
she ever expected me

1061
01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.026
to do all this.

1062
01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:44.030
Thinking back now. I got
away with things that maybe

1063
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.284
a normal husband
wouldn't have got away with.

1064
01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.828
At the time it was just a
dream but I thought to myself.

1065
01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.372
if I'm ever lucky enough
to ever live in Australia.

1066
01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:53.832
and certainly live out here.

1067
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.918
I would love to do
some kind of display.

1068
01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.712
- We all thought it
was going to be bullshit

1069
01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:02.257
and you know. no one's going
to go to the Mad Max Museum.

1070
01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.634
But it's the most
popular thing out here.

1071
01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.512
Everyone that comes here
and they don't know where it is.

1072
01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.848
well. where's Mad Max Museum?

1073
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:10.683
Up the hill.

1074
01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:14.102
- This being known as the
Hollywood of the Outback.

1075
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.230
I just found it odd that
there was really nothing

1076
01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.024
to show that films
are shot here.

1077
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.817
Especially with a
film like Mad Max 2

1078
01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:24.404
which of course is one of
the biggest films ever made.

1079
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.291
The majority of photographs here

1080
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.460
were given to me by
cast and crew members.

1081
01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.670
extras as well from Broken Hill.

1082
01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:41.797
There's a lot more to the film

1083
01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.132
than the 90 minutes
you see on the screen.

1084
01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.010
For instance. we have
just this photograph here

1085
01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.221
that shows one of the bad guys

1086
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.348
eating a chocolate
bar. having a laugh.

1087
01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.682
And I think that's important.

1088
01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.018
just to let people
know. and show people.

1089
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.438
exactly what went
on at the same time.

1090
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.650
These are just a few of
the people that I've ever met

1091
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:05.320
or people that have called
in to see us at the museum.

1092
01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:08.907
which is a real honour
for me. a real big honour.

1093
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.535
Oh. actually we were
doing some work at the back

1094
01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.328
and a chap came round the back

1095
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.455
and he just said. oh.
are you the owner?

1096
01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:16.873
I said. yes. he said.

1097
01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.583
my wife would love a
photograph with you.

1098
01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.669
And I said. yeah. that's no
problem. I'll come around.

1099
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.711
And he said. oh. I
should let you know.

1100
01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.880
it's Mel Gibson's sister.

1101
01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:26.758
So you can imagine that
I was a little bit nervous.

1102
01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.594
You never know who's
gonna walk through the door.

1103
01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.097
- Go up there and
growl at the camera.

1104
01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:34.182
Right down the
lens. run up to it.

1105
01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.850
- Mel came into the bar one day

1106
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.019
and he had all this gravel rash

1107
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.773
and it was all weeping
and it looked terrible.

1108
01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.400
And I said. ugh. I'll go and get

1109
01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:44.901
someone to do
something about that

1110
01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:46.987
and he just laughed
because it was just makeup

1111
01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:51.658
and here's stupid me
thinking that was the real thing.

1112
01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.451
- Well. this display here

1113
01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:57.831
features parts from the
Interceptor double car.

1114
01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:01.751
which is the one that
they rolled and wrecked.

1115
01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.878
If you're lucky enough
when you're fossicking around

1116
01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:08.049
you can find little bits and
pieces that are still around.

1117
01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.218
To some people
it looks like bits

1118
01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.596
of broken glass
and things like that.

1119
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.347
but for me. finding something
like these pieces here.

1120
01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:15.348
the bits off the car.

1121
01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:18.101
must be like a
prospector finding gold.

1122
01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:21.063
- Oh. that's rock.

1123
01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:24.691
God dammit.

1124
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.906
- Oh. I found it. I found
what you were picking up.

1125
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:36.286
Mad Max first entered
my life on June 8th. 2016.

1126
01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.663
That's the day I met Tank.

1127
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.917
I was working for
a television station

1128
01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:44.502
at Eternal Con on Long Island

1129
01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:46.671
and I'm interviewing an Iron Man

1130
01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.256
when out of the corner of my eye

1131
01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:53.178
I see this hulking.
naked figure.

1132
01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.554
I think my first
question to Tank was.

1133
01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.641
who the hell are you
and why are you naked?

1134
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.893
I said. can I just come up
to your house for a weekend

1135
01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:03.480
and do a little three minute
video for my news station?

1136
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.523
- Ham and Swiss
or spinach and feta?

1137
01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.818
- I'll go ham and
swish. swish. swish.

1138
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.111
- Two days later.
we start filming.

1139
01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.697
He calls me up a couple
of days later and he goes.

1140
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:15.533
by the way. this is
what I do all year long.

1141
01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:18.578
- And some cake to
chase that coffee down.

1142
01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:19.788
Just the plain one.

1143
01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.623
- And he said. do you want
to come to Australia with me?

1144
01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:22.792
I said. hell yeah I do.

1145
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.296
We traveled the world
together many times over.

1146
01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:33.301
And eventually we fell in love.

1147
01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.344
Some days I want to kill him.

1148
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.389
but he feels like my
best friend. you know?

1149
01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.183
- I have lipstick on now?

1150
01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.184
- No.
- Okay.

1151
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.648
- I think that he has a very
rigid view on masculinity

1152
01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.026
and I challenge that a lot.

1153
01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:52.737
Men can have feelings.
men can open up.

1154
01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.739
- I don't know what it is.
- It's a piece of car.

1155
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.367
- He hides behind
a lot of walls.

1156
01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.080
He gets to hide behind the mask.

1157
01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.500
- Oh!
- Oh. yes!

1158
01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.253
- Yeah!
- Holy shit!

1159
01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:10.004
Oh my god!

1160
01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:13.007
- It's a piece of
potentially Toadie's badge!

1161
01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.926
- Yep.
- Wow.

1162
01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.012
We got to compare it
to some screenshots.

1163
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.725
- Well done. Tank.
that's gold. mate.

1164
01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:24.477
Suck it. King Tutankhamen.

1165
01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.024
- I like to visit
the movie location

1166
01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:34.030
and after a while I
started this rock museum.

1167
01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:37.907
I went quite everywhere
where they shot the movies

1168
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.659
so I have quite a lot.

1169
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.870
Obviously rocks
were really important

1170
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.872
for me at the beginning.

1171
01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:48.878
Now I succeed to pick
up a little piece of the road.

1172
01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.254
of the bitumen.

1173
01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:53.840
I mean they shot the
movie on that bitumen

1174
01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:57.469
so it's like. you
know. interesting.

1175
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:58.928
Actually I don't
really care about

1176
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.514
how beautiful the rocks are.

1177
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:04.476
it's just they were
picked at the right place

1178
01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:08.980
and now it's a beautiful

1179
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:13.319
collection of stuff.

1180
01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:24.412
- Gradually I realised
that whilst I was

1181
01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.415
from a completely
different background.

1182
01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:32.421
I had through this film
extraordinary unforeseen affinities

1183
01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.173
with those people.

1184
01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.926
I would like to really
congratulate you

1185
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.803
on keeping this cinema open.

1186
01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:43.306
I'm now very fond of
them and strangely enough.

1187
01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.184
they seem to be very fond of me.

1188
01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:51.689
- We all rub
shoulder to shoulder.

1189
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.026
We're all stars
in our own right.

1190
01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:00.490
Being a fan of Mad
Max. it grows on you.

1191
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.450
It grows on you.

1192
01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.621
- Hey. for a 38 year old
movie that's not bad. huh?

1193
01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:10.209
- It's a story of survival.
and I thought about myself.

1194
01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:16.632
In 1998. they said. you've
got a tumor in your spinal cord.

1195
01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:22.136
The doctor got all the
tumor out of the spinal cord

1196
01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:25.014
but it left all this damage.

1197
01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:29.769
It took me months. but I
finally got the big toe moving.

1198
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.856
Nine months later I
walked out of there.

1199
01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:34.357
It's up to each
and every one of us

1200
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:38.736
to have that determination
to push ourselves through.

1201
01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.282
- I've got that fighting
spirit. I won't give up.

1202
01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:43.825
I've been through a
hell of a lot of trauma

1203
01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.744
and this one's been
through it with me.

1204
01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:49.163
Still fighting the
fight of cancer now.

1205
01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:52.458
and I'm not going to give
up. I won't stop smiling

1206
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.168
and keep the fight.

1207
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:57.255
Every day is worth living
and you've got to fight it.

1208
01:17:57.256 --> 01:18:02.468
- And that's Mad Max.
daily battle to survive.

1209
01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:05.388
We'll get there.
yeah. we'll make it.

1210
01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:08.224
- First thing I done.
when I got back

1211
01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:12.729
I asked the person with
me to get a handful of soil

1212
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.564
and put it in my hands.

1213
01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:18.110
I rubbed it through my
fingers and I said. I'm home.

1214
01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:27.452
- Now you'll
be able to walk.

1215
01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:30.246
- I can die happy now.
it's all good.

1216
01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:32.832
- Last of the V8 Interceptors.

1217
01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:35.084
It fills people's lives.
makes 'em happy.

1218
01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.921
If it makes 'em happy
then it's good to do.

1219
01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:41.883
- The mateship. the
comradery. it's infectious.

1220
01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.844
It's Australian and I love it.

1221
01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.806
- And it only lasts a few days.

1222
01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:52.101
And then it's time to
go back to the real world

1223
01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:53.103
and that's hard.

1224
01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:56.481
That's a bit of a let down.
I mean. you're not only

1225
01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.858
going back to your day job
and taking the costume off

1226
01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:00.945
but you're leaving
family behind.

1227
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.323
This is not just a Comic
Convention or something.

1228
01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.533
This is a family reunion.

1229
01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.453
- And it's incredible
'cause 10 days maybe total

1230
01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.413
have been spent
together and they feel like

1231
01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.041
I've known them my whole life.

1232
01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.087
- There's been so
many great things

1233
01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.838
that have come out of all this.

1234
01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.633
people that have
come into my life.

1235
01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:25.426
That have changed my life.

1236
01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:30.390
and hopefully they'll stick
around for the rest of my life.

1237
01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:31.891
- You're a special one.

1238
01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.268
- Am I now?
- Mister Tank.

1239
01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.647
How'd we do?
- We did great.

1240
01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:40.566
- There was always
individuals inspired to create

1241
01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:43.695
and over time if you
love it. you just stay with it

1242
01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.697
and it doesn't matter if
you don't know anyone else

1243
01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.073
who's involved in it.

1244
01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:49.659
Certainly. you want
to be executed?

1245
01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:53.913
But the beauty of it is there
is a big community out there

1246
01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.748
of people who
are all like-minded.

1247
01:19:55.749 --> 01:20:00.211
who have the same roaring
desire for this franchise.

1248
01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:14.308
Nothing can prepare
for that moment

1249
01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:17.061
when you drive towards
the Wasteland city

1250
01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.688
for the first time.

1251
01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:21.357
And you're seeing it
rise out of the desert

1252
01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:23.193
and it's on.

1253
01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:29.282
- We started Wasteland
Weekend in 2010.

1254
01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:32.368
We wanted to have a
gathering of Mad Max fans

1255
01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.370
and do it out in our own
little piece of the wasteland

1256
01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.415
and we thought some
people might show up.

1257
01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.334
- It's a crazy
event. it is massive.

1258
01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:41.961
I think last year they
had probably around

1259
01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.714
4.000 people attend.

1260
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.677
It takes hours to get
in. it's just. it's insane.

1261
01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:53.306
- We go in. we kill.
we capture them!

1262
01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.975
Being Wez at Wasteland Weekend

1263
01:20:55.976 --> 01:21:00.146
is nothing short of being
an epic rock star for a week.

1264
01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:01.231
Wez. you missed your cue.

1265
01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.485
Valley of Death?

1266
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.946
- This is the Valley of Death!

1267
01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:11.240
- Tank's tribe
is really the tribe for

1268
01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.201
screen accurate Mad Max 2 stuff.

1269
01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:16.037
- We kill. we capture!
- Wez. no!

1270
01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.955
- I don't think anybody's
living a better life

1271
01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:19.916
than Steve Scholz when
he's dressed up as Wez.

1272
01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.501
It's incredible to watch.

1273
01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:24.212
- I understand your pain.

1274
01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.548
- And now it's Lord
Humungus and Lady Faye

1275
01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.133
of the Dogs of War.

1276
01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:30.176
- People ask me all the time.

1277
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.178
with all this cosplay
stuff that I do

1278
01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.596
do you make any money doing it?

1279
01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:35.306
And I say. believe it or not.

1280
01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:38.352
the one thing that actually
makes money is the DJing thing.

1281
01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:43.189
DJ Humungus is very
heavy. unforgivingly heavy.

1282
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.775
Still very danceable.

1283
01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.905
It started out as just
a silly idea. who knew.

1284
01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:02.875
- My dogs. we're
gathered here today.

1285
01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:03.752
- So good.

1286
01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:06.379
- You must not be selfish.

1287
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.132
You must not hoard your
gasoline from one another.

1288
01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:13.636
You must listen to each
other's reason. especially hers.

1289
01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.221
- So many people showed up.

1290
01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.889
There's people like
ringed three and four deep

1291
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:18.391
outside the dome.

1292
01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.226
I'm looking up. there's
people climbing the dome.

1293
01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:22.770
local Cal City Police
Department was there

1294
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.730
working the event.
they were on the dome

1295
01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:25.691
to see what was going on.

1296
01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:27.275
- Local sheriff's department
was on the dome.

1297
01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:28.152
- Oh man.

1298
01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:30.486
- We have multiple
wedding requests every year.

1299
01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:31.779
but okay. if you
want to do that.

1300
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.990
I mean. it's. it's your wedding
if you want us to ruin it.

1301
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.160
- With the power assumed by me.

1302
01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.704
And once I did
one. everybody else

1303
01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.998
just wanted to follow
suit at Wasteland.

1304
01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:42.833
said. I've got
to get in on this.

1305
01:22:42.834 --> 01:22:44.458
I need the Lord
Humungus to marry me.

1306
01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:48.963
- If any Wastelander has
an objection to this union.

1307
01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.799
- Tank doesn't become
Tank until he puts that mask on

1308
01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.468
and then he just gets
to become this funny.

1309
01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:58.139
lighthearted guy. everybody
eats it up. everybody loves it.

1310
01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:04.854
Tank's only just started doing
that without the mask with me

1311
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:07.148
in the last couple of months.

1312
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:11.694
Gently over time. he's
changed into something

1313
01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.615
a little softer and a
little more open-minded.

1314
01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:22.246
- A lot of people give me
strange looks when they ask me.

1315
01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.248
oh. where did you
meet your husband?

1316
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.625
I always hesitate.

1317
01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.502
They might think. well.
why do you want to go

1318
01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.795
and celebrate the apocalypse?

1319
01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:31.798
You know. isn't that
kind of depressing?

1320
01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:35.968
But it's quite the
opposite for us.

1321
01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:40.806
Sometimes when you
face the potential end

1322
01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:44.186
you face the ability
to celebrate life itself.

1323
01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.195
- The whole
post-apocalyptic genre

1324
01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.905
is I think a positive thing.

1325
01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.366
because it means there
is a post-apocalypse.

1326
01:23:58.367 --> 01:23:59.660
There is something after.

1327
01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.203
- You can be more
your own person.

1328
01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.621
Like everyday you get
up and you go to work

1329
01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.374
and you're. you know. you're
Joe Schmo in your cubicle job

1330
01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.792
being told what
to do by your boss

1331
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.919
and you feel like you have
no autonomy in your life.

1332
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.964
The end of the world.
you're in charge.

1333
01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:16.676
It's easier to feel like you're
more important in the waste.

1334
01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:19.971
- Wasteland is very inclusive
and people may think.

1335
01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.514
oh. only certain
people can come here.

1336
01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.557
Let me tell you.
everybody is beautiful

1337
01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:26.310
and passionate about what
they do as far as Wasteland goes.

1338
01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:31.066
- The real world I work
for the Port of Los Angeles.

1339
01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.278
- I'm a middle school
science teacher.

1340
01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:36.612
- Anybody could belong.

1341
01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:41.325
It doesn't matter how old you
are or what your background is

1342
01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:44.996
or what country you're from
or what language you speak.

1343
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.248
It doesn't matter. I
think everybody fits in.

1344
01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:49.750
I think everybody's
trying to fit in somehow.

1345
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:53.004
- I had no idea that
there was other people

1346
01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:56.173
as weird as I am. but
like I found my family.

1347
01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:57.926
It's like my home
away from home.

1348
01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.762
We've got people
in Japan. Australia.

1349
01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:05.850
Holland. Italy. Ireland.

1350
01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.351
- Canada. Mexico.
- Scotland.

1351
01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.563
- We know there's other groups
out there. there's Germans.

1352
01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.690
- Oh yeah. the Germans!

1353
01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:20.114
- Our group consists
of more than 300 people.

1354
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.784
Prop makers. models. dancers.

1355
01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.663
In this rotten and rusty world

1356
01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:32.044
the Cult of Chrome's the cult
to achieve something bigger.

1357
01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:36.756
- We all understand
the language of survival.

1358
01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:39.050
We all understand
the apocalypse.

1359
01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.845
- Everybody
somehow can relate to Mad Max.

1360
01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:29.476
- There's always a new
fan base that rediscovers it.

1361
01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:32.144
And that's where it
keeps on growing.

1362
01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:35.272
- When Fury Road came out
it gave a real shot in the arm.

1363
01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:38.901
Now we have a new set
of inspirational visual things

1364
01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:40.861
that we can play with.

1365
01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:45.241
- Fury Road changed how
I look at the whole series.

1366
01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:47.243
- It was at the
festival of Cannes.

1367
01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:51.122
so Mad Max gained
cultural prestige.

1368
01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:53.791
- Having Furiosa as a
strong female character

1369
01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.042
that's also disabled.

1370
01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.420
it's just really great to see
that representation in film.

1371
01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:00.923
- Women can kick arse
just as much as men can.

1372
01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.717
- When I saw the
movie. made me free.

1373
01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:07.638
More Japanese women
watched that movie.

1374
01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:11.100
- Max and Furiosa
stand their own ground.

1375
01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:13.978
I really liked that
balance. that equality.

1376
01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:15.396
- None of us would
ever know each other

1377
01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.772
if it wasn't for the
Mad Max movies.

1378
01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.693
if it wasn't for Mad
Max and then Wasteland

1379
01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.571
we all wouldn't
be here right now.

1380
01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:27.950
- Dressing up didn't seem like

1381
01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:30.161
it was ever going to
be a thing that I did.

1382
01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:31.537
Now that I'm
comfortable doing it

1383
01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:34.498
and I don't feel like
a complete doofus

1384
01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.918
it is transformative.

1385
01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:41.506
Meeting Tank brought
out the doer in me.

1386
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.096
- I think he is a
very lucky individual

1387
01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.766
to have found something that
he is that passionate about.

1388
01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:55.978
Even if people do not understand

1389
01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.691
how somebody can be so
passionate about a movie.

1390
01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:04.236
- It opened up a
world of adventure

1391
01:28:04.237 --> 01:28:07.031
that I otherwise would
not have encountered.

1392
01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:12.244
And of friendships and of
understanding of other people.

1393
01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:15.831
- A lot of people say. it
took me a lot to get out here

1394
01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:18.792
and to be around people
'cause they're not a people person

1395
01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:19.877
or they're an introvert.

1396
01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.170
But you know what.
they have this passion.

1397
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:22.546
like I want to do this.

1398
01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.132
- There are people that
live Wasteland all the time.

1399
01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.344
They bought land
out near the site.

1400
01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:29.970
- My life has always been.

1401
01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.431
if a door opens
I'll run through it.

1402
01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:34.475
I've done a lot of really
dumb stuff in my life

1403
01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.476
because of it.

1404
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.437
But on my death bed. I
would lay there and go.

1405
01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:39.438
yeah. I've lived.

1406
01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:50.074
- We can open her up a bit.

1407
01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:51.575
- Whoa. whoa!

1408
01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:52.911
Woo hoo!

1409
01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:02.628
- My general formula
for my students is.

1410
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:05.923
follow your bliss. I
mean. find where it is

1411
01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.510
and don't be
afraid to follow it.

1412
01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:19.646
The influence of a
vital person vitalises.

1413
01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.732
The world is a wasteland.

1414
01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:27.778
People have the notion
of saving the world

1415
01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:31.449
by shifting it around and
changing the rules and so forth.

1416
01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:36.495
Any world is a living
world if it's alive.

1417
01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:38.289
And the thing is
to bring it to life

1418
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.292
and the way to bring it to
life is defined in your own case

1419
01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:44.713
where your life is and be
alive yourself it seems to me.

1420
01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:02.146
- There was a moment I
had climbing up the mountain

1421
01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:07.026
overlooking the Pinnacles
where a friend of mine was worried

1422
01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:08.027
and he's like. you
know. be careful.

1423
01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.486
watch your foot
here. let me help you.

1424
01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:14.366
I said. don't worry. this
is where I want to die.

1425
01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:17.911
And I mean that. this is. can
you imagine a better place

1426
01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:20.915
to call the home for the
rest of your existence?

1427
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.022
- One of the requests
that I've made

1428
01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:49.068
when my time is eventually
up is I've asked my wife. Linda.

1429
01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.779
to come out here on a windy
day and scatter my ashes

1430
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.198
and make sure they
blow all across the plains

1431
01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.159
and that would make
me a happy man.

1432
01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:01.455
- All the Mad Max fans.
they are fans forever.

1433
01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:04.833
until their last day and
some of them are going to be

1434
01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:07.711
buried in their car or
in some sacred land

1435
01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:09.213
in the wasteland somewhere.

1436
01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.840
Me. when my
book will be finished

1437
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:14.886
I will turn the page and
move onto something else.

1438
01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:23.644
Now my next dream is to
maybe write a book about

1439
01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:26.021
Crocodile Dundee's movie.

1440
01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:30.192
I have a lot of ideas on
what maybe the next dreams

1441
01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:34.905
I will fulfill in 20
years. who knows?

1442
01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:36.700
I mean. I don't know.

1443
01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:45.125
- Life is very
short in the scale of things.

1444
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:53.425
And so bite on it. make every
day. every hour. every minute

1445
01:31:57.637 --> 01:32:01.182
as intense as can be.

1446
01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:09.481
I never thought one day

1447
01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:13.485
that I would go
back to the wasteland

1448
01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:16.740
as maybe the last thing I do.
