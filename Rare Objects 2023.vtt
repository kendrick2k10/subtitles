00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:46.520
-What's your name?

544
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:49.610
-Uh. Peter. P-Peter Kessler.

545
00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:52.787
-Peter.

546
00:42:54.702 --> 00:42:56.617
I'm Diana.

547
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:58.445
-Yes.

548
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:02.928
-Let me just have
a minute to think.

549
00:43:02.971 --> 00:43:04.930
-Of course. Yes.

550
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:14.113
Might I inquire. is it a special
occasion you're preparing for?

551
00:43:14.156 --> 00:43:16.855
-Oh. it's an occasion.

552
00:43:18.683 --> 00:43:20.423
-Uh-huh.

553
00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:23.078
-The museum is putting
our family name

554
00:43:23.122 --> 00:43:24.863
on one of their wings.

555
00:43:24.906 --> 00:43:30.042
And my sister is
the guest of honor.

556
00:43:30.085 --> 00:43:31.521
-Because of Dad.

557
00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:34.350
-And the museum loves you.

558
00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:36.483
To my dear sister Diana.

559
00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:40.095
who bestows this fine city
with her artistry.

560
00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:41.662
Cheers.

561
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.359
-Cheers.
And congratulations.

562
00:43:43.403 --> 00:43:46.145
-Thank you. [Laughs]

563
00:43:59.941 --> 00:44:01.377
Hmm.

564
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:03.466
Oh.

565
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.034
I think I'll do
the layering look.

566
00:44:08.123 --> 00:44:11.605
And I'll just get
a simpler dress.

567
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:15.000
-All right. So both pieces?

568
00:44:15.043 --> 00:44:18.133
Benita. would you please do
the honors.

569
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:19.918
And I'll do the math.
[Chuckles]

570
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:24.749
And may I just say. I actually
have one of your father's prints

571
00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:26.141
just above my fireplace.

572
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:27.534
-Oh. which one?

573
00:44:27.577 --> 00:44:31.103
-Uh. Tulips in March. 1991.
Beautiful.

574
00:44:31.146 --> 00:44:34.541
-Inspired by Diana and
their mornings at Gramercy Park.

575
00:44:34.584 --> 00:44:37.762
-You came. too. [Chuckles]

576
00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:40.852
We would go to the park
after Dad was finished painting.

577
00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:45.204
He would paint all night. and we
would fight over the swings.

578
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.380
Remember. we would get
hot chocolate sometimes.

579
00:44:47.423 --> 00:44:48.598
-Mm-hmm.
-Do you think the place

580
00:44:48.642 --> 00:44:49.774
is still open?
Can we go?

581
00:44:49.817 --> 00:44:51.601
-Yeah.

582
00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:56.650
-There's your total.
And you can just...

583
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.347
Thank you.

584
00:44:58.391 --> 00:45:00.219
-Benita!

585
00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:03.657
I know where
I've seen you before.

586
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:07.922
Remember. you were at. um...

587
00:45:07.966 --> 00:45:11.056
You were at my table

588
00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:13.319
at the Diamond Ball

589
00:45:13.362 --> 00:45:18.803
with. um. Aaron and Lauren.

590
00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:20.630
-Yes. It was a beautiful night.

591
00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:23.198
-It was. wasn't it?

592
00:45:23.242 --> 00:45:25.505
-It was so beautiful.

593
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:27.333
-And successful.

594
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:30.075
Didn't you raise $4 million
that night?

595
00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:34.427
-Yes. uh. it I believe so.

596
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.778
-Talented and beautiful.

597
00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:39.040
-You were there. too. correct?

598
00:45:39.084 --> 00:45:40.607
-I was.

599
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.479
-Well. it's been
an absolute honor serving you.

600
00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:46.047
And thank you very much.
Please come again.

601
00:45:46.091 --> 00:45:48.876
-Bye. Paul.

602
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.183
-Bye-bye.

603
00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:52.750
-Bye.
-Thank you. James.

604
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:58.016
-Bye.

605
00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:00.322
-It was nice seeing you.
-You too.

606
00:46:03.848 --> 00:46:06.459
-Well. you're a woman
of many faces.

607
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.071
[Sighs]

608
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:12.204
[Horn honks]

609
00:46:12.247 --> 00:46:14.554
-Are you going to
tell me what's going on?

610
00:46:14.597 --> 00:46:17.470
-Your tio Alvaro is very sick.

611
00:46:17.513 --> 00:46:20.255
We don't know
how much time he has.

612
00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:25.086
He was always so good to me.

613
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:26.958
He would tell me
the best stories

614
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:30.265
when I was a little girl
to help me fall asleep.

615
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:32.572
He would pick a fight
with our father

616
00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:35.140
so that my father
wouldn't come after me.

617
00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:38.970
He was the one who helped me
to come here.

618
00:46:39.013 --> 00:46:42.538
He wanted a better life for you.

619
00:46:42.582 --> 00:46:46.151
I just want a simple life.

620
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:51.504
People being good to each other.

621
00:46:51.547 --> 00:46:53.332
Kindness.

622
00:46:56.639 --> 00:47:02.080
Benita. you must always
protect yourself.

623
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:04.299
Do you understand?

624
00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:05.648
-Stop!

625
00:47:08.042 --> 00:47:11.567
-So tell me. how was your day?

626
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:12.873
-I made a sale.

627
00:47:12.917 --> 00:47:14.962
-You did?!
-Mm-hmm.

628
00:47:15.006 --> 00:47:17.269
-Oh. that's so good!

629
00:47:17.312 --> 00:47:19.140
That's good!

630
00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:21.186
Oh. Oh.

631
00:47:22.796 --> 00:47:24.885
-There you are. Careful.

632
00:47:24.929 --> 00:47:27.627
[Knocking]

633
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.890
-Take her out to lunch.

634
00:47:29.934 --> 00:47:32.284
-No. no. no. no. It's fine.

635
00:47:32.327 --> 00:47:34.112
It's okay.

636
00:47:34.155 --> 00:47:36.854
-No. Enjoy being young.

637
00:47:36.897 --> 00:47:38.159
Go on.

638
00:47:38.203 --> 00:47:39.857
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

639
00:47:42.294 --> 00:47:44.296
-I've been trying
to forget my memories.

640
00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.515
Sometimes I think...

641
00:47:48.169 --> 00:47:50.476
...isn't it better
to not remember the times

642
00:47:50.519 --> 00:47:53.305
you were happy?

643
00:47:53.348 --> 00:47:56.699
-Or better to make new ones.

644
00:48:00.312 --> 00:48:03.881
-Are you happy
working at Winshaw Kessler?

645
00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:08.363
-You know. I'm starting to get
used to the smell of aged wood

646
00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:12.106
and silver. polish
and furniture oil.

647
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.195
-[Laughs]
-And...

648
00:48:14.239 --> 00:48:17.416
-All those pretty things.

649
00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:21.899
You are like a jewel
in your own jewelry box.

650
00:48:23.857 --> 00:48:25.815
-I didn't think of it like that.

651
00:48:27.817 --> 00:48:32.213
I do feel like I'm in
another time when I'm there.

652
00:48:32.257 --> 00:48:34.085
-What time?

653
00:48:35.477 --> 00:48:39.568
-Sometimes the '20s. the '50s.

654
00:48:41.353 --> 00:48:43.224
-And you get to
touch everything. right?

655
00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:46.924
-Yeah. And polish it.

656
00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:52.103
-Wow.

657
00:48:52.146 --> 00:48:53.582
That part is cool.

658
00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:57.369
Like. I think of where
each piece has been.

659
00:48:57.412 --> 00:49:01.590
-Mm. what happened to that lamp
that was sitting in that room?

660
00:49:01.634 --> 00:49:04.071
-Oh. Were people having sex
right next to it?

661
00:49:04.115 --> 00:49:05.551
-Yeah. [Laughs]
-Yeah.

662
00:49:05.594 --> 00:49:08.249
-Yeah. Maybe.

663
00:49:08.293 --> 00:49:09.859
-You know.
how did that go about?

664
00:49:09.903 --> 00:49:11.600
-[Laughs]

665
00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:14.995
-Who were these people?

666
00:49:15.039 --> 00:49:17.389
-Yeah. I don't know. But...

667
00:49:17.432 --> 00:49:19.130
-How long have you worked there?

668
00:49:19.173 --> 00:49:21.959
-Um. not long.

669
00:49:22.002 --> 00:49:27.312
It wasn't easy to find a job.

670
00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:28.617
-What?

671
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:30.793
-When did --
when did you get out?

672
00:49:33.883 --> 00:49:35.973
-A couple of days ago.

673
00:49:37.844 --> 00:49:40.325
-Well. I'm so happy to see you.

674
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:44.982
-I'm happy to see you. too.

675
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.682
It was horrible
in there without you.

676
00:49:52.554 --> 00:49:55.731
I couldn't believe it
when you left.

677
00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:57.864
It's like you just disappeared.

678
00:49:59.866 --> 00:50:03.391
-How -- how did you get out?

679
00:50:03.435 --> 00:50:06.829
-Mm. Oh. yes.

680
00:50:06.873 --> 00:50:08.831
I convinced them that
I was no longer dependent

681
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:12.226
on the habit
of escaping my difficulties.

682
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.663
That I had regained touch
with reality.

683
00:50:14.707 --> 00:50:19.973
And I was now going to recover
and live a normal life.

684
00:50:22.236 --> 00:50:24.282
[Chuckles]

685
00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:25.848
A normal life.

686
00:50:25.892 --> 00:50:28.416
Who in the world
would want something so small?

687
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:33.595
-Most people don't
have a choice.

688
00:50:36.468 --> 00:50:38.383
-That's sad.

689
00:50:45.129 --> 00:50:46.739
I'm happy for you.

690
00:50:46.782 --> 00:50:48.306
[Clink]

691
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:50.003
-Thank you.

692
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:53.615
-I mean. you get yourself a job.

693
00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:55.878
You really turned
your life around.

694
00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.057
No one knows you in
the hospital. right?

695
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.407
-No.
-Okay. good.

696
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.322
Yeah. You didn't tell anybody?

697
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:06.193
-No. no.
-You'll be marked for life.

698
00:51:06.237 --> 00:51:08.674
Trust me.

699
00:51:08.717 --> 00:51:12.069
-No. I wa-- I wasn't
planning on it.

700
00:51:13.418 --> 00:51:15.898
-We're going to do great.

701
00:51:15.942 --> 00:51:17.248
Second chances.

702
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:19.032
-Yeah.

703
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.773
Second chances.

704
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.215
-How was your lunch?

705
00:51:28.259 --> 00:51:31.566
-It was really nice.

706
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.613
I had really good spaghetti.

707
00:51:34.656 --> 00:51:38.138
-Oh. I do love some pomodoro.

708
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.532
Oh. could you close up tonight?
I have to leave early.

709
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:43.012
I have tickets for
the opening night of the ballet.

710
00:51:43.056 --> 00:51:46.233
-Yeah. right. Of course.
That's tonight.

711
00:51:46.277 --> 00:51:48.017
-Oh. were you planning
on attending?

712
00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:50.890
-I had to give my seats away.
I have another commitment.

713
00:51:50.933 --> 00:51:52.718
-Too bad.

714
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:55.242
There's nothing
like an opening night.

715
00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.026
I still get butterflies.

716
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.647
-Yeah. there's definitely like
a little bit of amber.

717
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:12.041
-A little bit of shit browns.
It's the lighting. [Laughs]

718
00:52:12.085 --> 00:52:13.695
-No. it's not.

719
00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:18.222
Let me see.

720
00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:19.353
