00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.366
<i>A movie actress</i>
<i>and four of her friends</i>
<i>were murdered.</i>

4
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.368
<i>The circumstances were lurid.</i>

5
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:28.306
<i>- The lawyer Paul Caruso said</i>
<i>five people dressed in black</i>
<i>entered Ms. Tate's home</i>

6
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.910
<i>after cutting the power
and telephone lines.</i>

7
00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:34.346
<i>and went methodically</i>
<i>about the business</i>
<i>of killing five people.</i>

8
00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.918
<i>Caruso represents Susan Atkins.
a member of the gang or commune.</i>

9
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:42.287
<i>He said she and the others</i>
<i>were completely</i>
<i>under what he called:</i>

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.289
<i>"The insane influence
of Charles Manson."</i>

11
00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:46.892
<i>You consider yourself
a member of a religious order?</i>

12
00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:49.294
<i>- In a sense. Mm-hmm.</i>

13
00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.399
<i>Believe me.
if I started murdering people...</i>

14
00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.436
<i>there'd be none of you left.</i>

15
00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:04.175
<i>The mind that you live in.
the thought that you live in...</i>

16
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.678
<i>is a family.</i>

17
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:07.813
<i>- You scared to die?</i>

18
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.385
<i>- Sometimes I feel
I'm scared to live.</i>

19
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.755
<i>Living's what scares me.</i>

20
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.791
<i>Dying is easy.</i>

21
00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.617
- Oh. sh...

22
00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:53.959
- Whoa! Do not hurt him.

23
00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.931
Come on back. man!

24
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.837
- We just want to talk. man!
- Come on!
- Come on. man!

25
00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.985
- Ah!
- That all you got?
- It's not gonna hurt you.

26
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.855
- No! No! No!

27
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.561
- Come on!
- Look at me! Look at me!

28
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.912
<i>- Charlie. you can't leave
your sheep behind.</i>

29
00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:48.914
<i>You're the shepherd.
you have to herd.</i>

30
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.618
<i>You created this movement.
You can't go.</i>

31
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:54.452
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

32
00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:58.456
Oh. my God.
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

33
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.992
Can you just cut the camera?

34
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:02.595
- Yeah. Alright.

35
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.499
Should I call the landlord?

36
00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:11.569
- No. I've already called him.
like. 20 times.
- Okay.

37
00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:14.506
Do you want me to. like.
go over there and talk to him?

38
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:16.642
- No. Mitch.
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:20.746
I'm sorry. It's just...
it's a really big callback.

40
00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:24.549
- I know.

41
00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.920
- Fuck it.
I'm gonna book a place.

42
00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:33.692
- Tiana. you really think
the background's gonna make
that big of a difference?

43
00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:38.697
- Baby. casting these days...
I have friends who literally
shoot on location and they book.

44
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:40.699
I guarantee you if we shoot
in the desert.

45
00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:42.735
it's gonna look
that much better.

46
00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:45.671
Look. This place is perfect.
It's 70 bucks.

47
00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:50.876
Give me half the day to shoot
and I'm yours
the rest of the weekend.

48
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.846
- I still don't really get it.
to be honest with you.

49
00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.582
- You don't get it
'cause it's arthouse.
- Arthouse. Please.

50
00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.853
They're making Charles Manson
look like a good guy.
Don't see how that's arthouse.

51
00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.855
- No. I think the director's
vision is he's trying

52
00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:04.990
to make him look like a prophet
or something.

53
00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:07.993
You know. he's trying to show
how his followers saw him
before he died.

54
00:04:08.027 --> 00:04:09.995
- A prophet?
- Yeah. Historically.

55
00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.598
they thought he was
the second coming of Jesus.

56
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:15.433
- Does the director have him
walking on water too?

57
00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:17.770
Coming out of the grave?

58
00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:55.573
- I lost my fiancé... Ben.

59
00:04:58.143 --> 00:04:59.879
It was last November.

60
00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:02.715
It was cancer.

61
00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:09.788
I know sometimes I feel like...
I feel like it was my fault.

62
00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:14.093
You know. I feel like... I feel
like I really could've just...

63
00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:17.162
- Could've what. Tiana?

64
00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:20.599
- I don't know.

65
00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:27.973
- It's natural to feel
a sense of responsibility
for the ones we lost.

66
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.175
But the reality is...

67
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.012
you don't control cancer.

68
00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.681
There's nothing you could do.

69
00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:51.429
- Mm. uh...

70
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:54.700
Nice little store you got here.
my friend.

71
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:57.836
Yeah. this is it for me. I...

72
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.040
You got sunblock?

73
00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:03.508
- Yeah. And you know what? Ahem.

74
00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:06.078
This here's on the house.

75
00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.647
Gets real hot out there.

76
00:06:09.048 --> 00:06:12.184
And you need to protect
that skin of yours.

77
00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:13.953
Keep that colour.

78
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.521
Just about perfect.

79
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.760
Hey. no drinks. but. uh...

80
00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.098
the locals are pleasant.

81
00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.168
You good?

82
00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:30.636
- Yeah.

83
00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:36.541
- You got the address?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:44.950
- Okay. that's where it is.

85
00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:50.555
Definitely seeing some
drunk bowling tonight.

86
00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:59.231
What. just right here?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:15.580
- Fucking awesome.
There's no service.

88
00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:18.549
I thought the ad said
there would be internet.

89
00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:20.285
- Uh. would you hand me mine.
actually?

90
00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:25.858
- What?

91
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:28.093
- Nothing. Grace just wanted me
to call her.

92
00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:31.130
I'm gonna have to head back
into town and grab service.

93
00:07:31.163 --> 00:07:34.133
May as well grab us some drinks
while I'm out?

94
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:37.136
Actually. uh.
you want to just come with?

95
00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.872
You know I suck
at picking mixers anyways.

96
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.142
- I'll be fine.

97
00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.011
Seriously. Mitch.

98
00:07:55.254 --> 00:07:57.823
- Well... groovy.

99
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.227
- Thanks.
- Alright.

100
00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:37.729
Everything's in the room.

101
00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:41.733
Last chance.

102
00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:43.869
- Strawberry.
- Whatever.

103
00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:45.737
Alright. I'll be right back.

104
00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.015
I got your text earlier.
What's going on?

105
00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:32.718
<i>Okay. don't freak out.
but I can't come tonight.</i>

106
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.319
<i>Judge finally granted us
that warrant.</i>

107
00:09:34.353 --> 00:09:37.856
- Grace.
<i>- Mitch. I'm sorry. I really am.</i>
<i>It's just...</i>

108
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:42.394
Can I at least come
tomorrow night
or the night after instead?

109
00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:44.296
- Yeah.

110
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:46.198
Yeah. look. just...

111
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.700
<i>just come tomorrow. alright?</i>

112
00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.303
Fuck I... I forgot to leave
your camera out for you.

113
00:09:51.336 --> 00:09:54.239
Look. the camera.
it's in Tiana's desk.
in her bedroom somewhere.

114
00:09:54.273 --> 00:09:56.775
Just grab it on your way.
Her key's under the mat.

115
00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:59.978
- You forget everything.
you know that. right?

116
00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.381
- Grace. I...

117
00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:04.950
Have you ever heard of a...

118
00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:07.186
a snake eating itself...

119
00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:10.422
as a symbol or a tattoo.
something?

120
00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:14.393
- Mitch. how about you just
focus on your lady. okay?

121
00:10:14.426 --> 00:10:16.361
- Yeah. Thanks.

122
00:10:31.476 --> 00:10:33.912
Mitch?

123
00:10:44.356 --> 00:10:45.791

Especially... everything
that happened with Ben and...

141
00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:02.120
- Hey!

142
00:14:14.466 --> 00:14:15.668
Hey.

143
00:14:16.568 --> 00:14:18.103
What?

144
00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:20.439
You're gonna crush this. okay?

145
00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:22.675
I'm serious.
No one deserves it more.

146
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.348
Can I ask you something?

147
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.652
- Sure.

148
00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:39.024
- Why do you want this one
so bad?

149
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.631
- In the script.
Annie loses her family
before she meets Manson.

150
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.637
And it hurts her so bad. uh.
she starts hurting herself.

151
00:14:53.572 --> 00:14:56.975
I know the script is silly.
but I just... this role...

152
00:14:58.076 --> 00:14:59.444
it's me.

153
00:15:05.283 --> 00:15:08.487
- Well. I think that they would
be fucking lucky to have you.

154
00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:18.296
Hey. uh. I'm gonna...
gonna take a walk. You
want to take a little break?

155
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.099
- Sooner I get this done.
the sooner I can kick your ass
in bowling.

156
00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:24.169
- Good luck. I love you.
- Love you.

157
00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:05.510
- Maybe this could work.

158
00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:18.658
Yeah...

159
00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:23.395
What would you say? You just...

160
00:16:26.364 --> 00:16:28.099
Tiana Williams...

161
00:16:29.234 --> 00:16:31.536
will you...
No. that's fucking lame.

162
00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:39.344
Well. uh...

163
00:17:36.267 --> 00:17:37.637
- Howdy.

164
00:17:38.604 --> 00:17:39.872
- Hey.

165
00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:42.675
What's up. man?

166
00:17:43.508 --> 00:17:45.543
- Just taking care of business.

167
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:51.282
They're for a...
rattle roundup.

168
00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:54.687
We sell the skins down in Indio.

169
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.388
- That's cool.
- You?

170
00:17:56.421 --> 00:17:58.591
- Uh. just a vacation.

171
00:17:58.624 --> 00:18:01.794
- Vacation. Vacation!
Come on. man!

172
00:18:01.827 --> 00:18:04.764
I saw you up there practicing.

173
00:18:04.797 --> 00:18:06.599
Come on. let's see it.

174
00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:11.671
- You want to see the ring?
- Today. junior. Come on.

175
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.909
Damn...

176
00:18:16.942 --> 00:18:19.577
That's a nice rock.
You must really love her. huh?

177
00:18:19.612 --> 00:18:22.580
- Thank you. I... I do.

178
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.518
- She have any idea?

179
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:30.990
- I don't know. man. I hope not.
- I hope not!

180
00:18:31.023 --> 00:18:32.725
I hope not.

181
00:18:34.492 --> 00:18:37.562
What's in the jar?

182
00:18:38.764 --> 00:18:40.900
- Uh... ashes.

183
00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:43.435
Relative died recently.

184
00:18:48.808 --> 00:18:50.776
- Oh. I'm sorry. man.

185
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.445
That...
Is that gravestone yours too?

186
00:18:54.914 --> 00:18:57.482
- Mm-hmm. Travis.

187
00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.284
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

188
00:18:59.317 --> 00:19:00.886
Good pup. he was.

189
00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:04.222
Good pup.

190
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.926
- Um... sorry to hear that.

191
00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:10.696
I hope you. uh.
you find a good spot or...

192
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.298
or... whatever. you know?

193
00:19:18.704 --> 00:19:22.273
- Hey! You ought to wear a hat
around here.

194
00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:25.543
The sun. it'll. uh.
darken up your face.

195
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.614
A man only gets to propose once.

196
00:19:32.417 --> 00:19:35.855
- You know it. brother. Yeah.
Hey. it was nice to meet you.

197
00:19:35.888 --> 00:19:38.858
- You take care now!
- Yeah. you too. man. You too.

198
00:19:48.701 --> 00:19:51.402
<i>Even though they have rebelled
against that society?</i>

199
00:19:51.436 --> 00:19:54.339
<i>Well. uh. who...
They weren't born rebelling.</i>

200
00:19:55.107 --> 00:19:57.475
<i>They weren't born with. uh...</i>

201
00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:02.447
<i>The mind that you live in.
the thought that you live in...</i>

202
00:20:03.048 --> 00:20:04.850
<i>is a family.</i>

203
00:20:04.884 --> 00:20:08.821
<i>Uh. uh. the anger
and frustration that they have.</i>

204
00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:10.756
<i>that had to be put on them
by somebody.</i>

205
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.725
<i>Somebody created them.</i>

206
00:20:12.758 --> 00:20:14.459
<i>Uh. it's as if...</i>

207
00:20:14.492 --> 00:20:16.028
<i>if you're outside...</i>

208
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.598
<i>and you live a life...</i>

209
00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.735
<i>on the outside.</i>

210
00:20:38.784 --> 00:20:41.620
<i>He's lost sight of his children.</i>

211
00:20:41.654 --> 00:20:46.424
<i>He doesn't see in the back.</i>
<i>He doesn't see in the shadows.</i>
- What are you watching?

212
00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:50.930
<i>Do guys belong on</i>
<i>a death row or a condemned row</i>
<i>if there is such a row?</i>

213
00:20:50.963 --> 00:20:52.865
- T?
- I found it.

214
00:20:52.898 --> 00:20:55.734
- You found what?
- I found a way in.

215
00:20:55.768 --> 00:20:58.971
Like. I already knew it.
but to connect Annie. I...

216
00:21:00.706 --> 00:21:02.074
It's fire monk.

217
00:21:02.107 --> 00:21:04.910
- Hmm. Fire monk?

218
00:21:08.113 --> 00:21:11.750
- Ready to shoot?
- Yeah. definitely. I just...
want to get cleaned up first.

219
00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:13.819
- You have my permission.
- Whatever.

220
00:21:13.853 --> 00:21:16.822
- Can you turn the AC on?
It's fucking hot.
- Yeah. one sec.

221
00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:55.493
<i>Tiana...</i>

222
00:21:56.695 --> 00:22:00.099
<i>first time I saw you.
I knew that I loved...</i>

223
00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:03.434
No. Jesus.
why is this so fucking hard?

224
00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:10.575
When I used to think
about my wedding...

225
00:22:12.477 --> 00:22:14.545
well. I'd just get sad.
because...

226
00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:19.885
all I could think about
was how my dad wasn't gonna
be there to enjoy it with me.

227
00:22:21.253 --> 00:22:24.957
But now all I see is...
you walking down the aisle.

228
00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:49.982
Damn.

229
00:22:51.717 --> 00:22:55.921
- Have you ever heard of this?
There's a monk from the '60s.
he set himself on fire.

230
00:22:55.955 --> 00:22:58.624
He was protesting the corrupt
government in Vietnam.

231
00:22:58.657 --> 00:23:01.627
and just a mere photo of the act
revolutionized the world.

232
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.029
- I'm sorry. Wait.
Am I the fire monk here?

233
00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:10.736
- So... when are you actually
gonna tell me your story?

234
00:23:12.104 --> 00:23:14.505
- I don't know. Haven't decided.

235
00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:19.244
- You're not comfortable yet?
- No. Not really. no.
That was just my first meeting.

236
00:23:20.813 --> 00:23:22.781
- I meant right now.

237
00:23:28.587 --> 00:23:29.955
- My dad...

238
00:23:31.323 --> 00:23:34.226
he was off-duty.
driving me and my sister home
in Virginia.

239
00:23:35.794 --> 00:23:37.830
We pull into the gas station.

240
00:23:38.964 --> 00:23:41.900
A couple kids run out.
masked up.

241
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:44.236
Dad tried to stop 'em.

242
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:47.538
One of 'em had a Glock.

243
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.009
What?

244
00:23:50.042 --> 00:23:52.244
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Cheers.

245
00:23:55.848 --> 00:23:59.084
Mind if I sip on this one?
I'd actually like to remember
tonight.

246
00:23:59.118 --> 00:24:02.921
- Why is that?
- Because I find you
interesting.

247
00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:08.193
Yeah. and you have this. uh...
fuck-off mentality.

248
00:24:08.227 --> 00:24:11.997
but once you get past that.
you're really
quite a charming person.

249
00:24:13.866 --> 00:24:17.236
- Are you flirting with me?
- You want me to?

250
00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:08.320
Holy shit!

251
00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:12.124
You actually pull it off.
no lie.

252
00:25:12.157 --> 00:25:13.992
- You look handsome.
- Mm.

253
00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:17.729
- Not a lot of fancy restaurants
around here. though.
- Yeah. just you.

254
00:25:18.664 --> 00:25:22.301
- You ready to do this?
- Oh. yeah. I'll be out front.
You really do look awesome.

255
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.339
- Big black bug
bit a big black bear.

256
00:25:27.372 --> 00:25:30.142
and the big black bear
bleed blood.

257
00:25:31.443 --> 00:25:33.846
Big black bug
bit a big black bear.

258
00:25:33.879 --> 00:25:35.914
and a big black bear
bleed blood.

259
00:25:35.948 --> 00:25:38.217
Big black bear bit
a big black bug and...

260
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.952
- Fucking actors. man.

261
00:25:39.985 --> 00:25:42.387
- Big black bug bit
a big black bear.

262
00:25:42.421 --> 00:25:44.923
and the big black bear
bleed blood.

263
00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:46.725
This is my mark?

264
00:25:46.758 --> 00:25:47.993
- Yeah.

265
00:25:50.195 --> 00:25:53.966
Alright. Damn. you went in
with the character prep.

266
00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:56.902
- Yeah. it was hard
getting inside of Annie's head.

267
00:25:57.936 --> 00:25:59.404
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:25:59.438 --> 00:26:02.407
- Alright. We are... rolling.

269
00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:09.148
- I'm getting tired. Charlie!
- You can do it. Annie.

270
00:26:09.181 --> 00:26:12.384
Find your inner power.
Robert. dump the body.

271
00:26:12.417 --> 00:26:15.254
Don't get queasy on me now.
Annie. These politicians.
they don't care.

272
00:26:15.287 --> 00:26:16.955
They don't care about you.

273
00:26:16.989 --> 00:26:18.824
- You care.
- Amen.

274
00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:23.795
- What will do in the new world?

275
00:26:23.829 --> 00:26:26.965
- There's so much anger
in this world. Annie.
so much hate.

276
00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:29.468
The new world is all chill
all day.

277
00:26:29.501 --> 00:26:32.070
The white way.
Grass and ass. you dig?

278
00:26:32.971 --> 00:26:35.274
- Messiah.
- Let me tell y'all.

279
00:26:35.307 --> 00:26:37.709
I'll be long gone
before the new world.

280
00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:40.279
and it's up to you
to complete the circle of life.

281
00:26:41.113 --> 00:26:43.015
Charlie's will is Man's son.

282
00:26:43.048 --> 00:26:44.850
- Charlie's will is Man's son.

283
00:26:44.883 --> 00:26:48.921
- Charlie's will is Man's son.
- Charlie's will is Man's son!

284
00:26:56.361 --> 00:26:58.397
- Boom. Got it.

285
00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:02.301
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

286
00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:08.840
What do you think?

287
00:27:08.874 --> 00:27:11.376
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I dig that.

288
00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.979
- Me. too.
I thought it was great.
You want to do one more?

289
00:27:14.012 --> 00:27:16.014
- No.
- No.
- Good job.

290
00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:18.383
You really brought it out in me.

291
00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:20.919
- I guess so.
- Let's get into the other
scenes.

292
00:27:20.953 --> 00:27:22.487
- Yeah. go.

293
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.727
- Was I right or was I right?
- Yeah. I'm not gonna lie.
It looks pretty awesome.

294
00:28:07.866 --> 00:28:09.368
- What's the matter?!

295
00:28:09.401 --> 00:28:11.236
Cat got your tongue?!

296
00:28:14.607 --> 00:28:16.241
Quiet now.

297
00:28:23.548 --> 00:28:25.117
Mm.

298
00:28:50.342 --> 00:28:53.045
Alright. alright. alright.

299
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.015
There she is.

300
00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:01.420
Hey... I'm proud of you.

301
00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:03.855
- Okay. shut up.
- No. I'm serious that...

302
00:29:03.889 --> 00:29:06.124
I mean it.
That was really good work
you did out there.

303
00:29:06.158 --> 00:29:09.528
I think you're gonna book it.
I have a good feeling.

304
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:12.030
- Okay.
- Alright.

305
00:29:12.064 --> 00:29:15.467
- Tiana. you deserve it.
Alright? You do.

306
00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:17.936
Come on. you do.

307
00:29:20.405 --> 00:29:23.075
- I was actually thinking
about staying in character
all weekend.

308
00:29:23.108 --> 00:29:24.811
- Fuck that.

309
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:30.382
- You know Margarita?

310
00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:32.584
Yes. darling.

311
00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:35.287
- Bye. loser.
- Extra tequila.

312
00:29:57.643 --> 00:29:59.645
Ah... Where's the ring?

313
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:52.598
Coming?

314
00:30:57.436 --> 00:30:59.237
You want lime juice in yours?

315
00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:02.040
- T. uh...

316
00:31:03.074 --> 00:31:05.043
you think we have
any neighbours?

317
00:31:05.076 --> 00:31:06.511
Fucking...

318
00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:09.381
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck. Tiana?!
- I-I'm sorry.

319
00:31:09.414 --> 00:31:11.483
Are you okay?

320
00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:13.084
- Um...

321
00:31:15.755 --> 00:31:18.056
Yeah.

322
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:19.391
I'm good.

323
00:31:20.525 --> 00:31:23.528
- Okay. well.
maybe we just stick to these?

324
00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:29.167
- Sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

325
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:31.169
It's just that. uh...

326
00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:34.105
I saw someone today...
on my way back.

327
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:36.041
- Did he talk to you
or something?

328
00:31:36.074 --> 00:31:38.043
- He was burying
one of his friends.

329
00:31:38.076 --> 00:31:40.555
- He was burying one
of his friends?
- His friend's ashes. but...

330
00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:42.247
but yeah. I mean...

331
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.483
I don't know. it was weird.

332
00:31:49.187 --> 00:31:51.156
I think we should leave early.

333
00:31:51.189 --> 00:31:54.292
- What?
Mitch. you're scaring me.
What's going on?

334
00:31:55.628 --> 00:31:58.296
- I don't want to freak you out
and I know I'm being paranoid.

335
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:03.168
but when I went
into the office earlier...
one of the windows was open.

336
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.373
- Mitch. I opened that window
when I was studying.

337
00:32:08.406 --> 00:32:11.243
- Tiana. don't laugh. Why
didn't you tell me that earlier?

338
00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:14.212
- You want me to tell you
every time I open a window?
- Yeah. I do.

339
00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:16.616
Every time. every window.
please and thank you.

340
00:32:18.316 --> 00:32:22.254
- What if it wasn't me?
Someone else broke in.
What would you have done?

341
00:32:22.287 --> 00:32:24.523
- I don't know.
- No. come on.
what would you have done?

342
00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:27.660
- I don't... I'm not in the mood
for this right now. T.

343
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.631
- Pussy.
- "Pussy." Okay. I mean...

344
00:32:31.664 --> 00:32:34.032
- Come on.
what would you have done?

345
00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:39.271
- I don't know.
I-I guess I would go to town
and contact the police.

346
00:32:39.304 --> 00:32:42.140
- Oh. contact the police.
That is every girl's dream.

347
00:32:42.173 --> 00:32:46.612
Come on. this is fun.
What would you have done?
Pressure's on. Save me. baby.

348
00:32:46.646 --> 00:32:49.214
- I... Alright.
then I guess I would...

349
00:32:49.247 --> 00:32:53.686
I would just... murder the guy
and we'd get into the car...

350
00:32:53.719 --> 00:32:56.488
be the next Bonnie and Clyde.
Is that what you want to hear?

351
00:32:56.521 --> 00:33:00.458
- But what if I had ate
all your candy on the drive
and I was like fat and old.

352
00:33:00.492 --> 00:33:02.795
would you still love me.
Mitchell?

353
00:33:02.828 --> 00:33:06.732
- Ms. Williams. I would love you
even if you were the fattest
and the oldest.

354
00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.534
I would die for you.

355
00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:13.538
- Don't say that.

356
00:33:14.707 --> 00:33:16.107
- Okay.

357
00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:22.682
Well. now I'm gonna say that
all the time.

358
00:33:22.715 --> 00:33:24.583
Come on.

359
00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:49.567
What?

360
00:35:06.886 --> 00:35:08.721
- Tiana?

361
00:35:08.754 --> 00:35:11.657
- Yeah.
- Is the tile that interesting?

362
00:35:12.825 --> 00:35:14.960
- Sorry. just tired.

363
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.000
- Hey. I saw your tape.
You were awesome.

364
00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:23.535
even with your neighbours
tapping on the wall.

365
00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:25.838
- Yeah.

366
00:35:27.305 --> 00:35:30.341
- Hey. what's up?
You've been acting weird lately.

367
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.877
- I'm fine.

368
00:35:32.678 --> 00:35:34.579
- Okay. Uh...

369
00:35:34.613 --> 00:35:38.583
So I've been thinking.
Thanksgiving being in a couple
weeks and all.

370
00:35:38.617 --> 00:35:42.554
um... I was hoping you'd finally
come meet my parents.

371
00:35:52.932 --> 00:35:54.365
- Mom?

372
00:35:58.303 --> 00:35:59.571
Dad?

373
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.945
Mom?

374
00:36:06.612 --> 00:36:07.813
Dad?

375
00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:23.796
- Shhh.

376
00:36:27.532 --> 00:36:29.567
You are very important.

377
00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:32.337
Do you know that?

378
00:36:34.907 --> 00:36:36.307
Yeah?

379
00:36:42.648 --> 00:36:43.883
Hey.

380
00:36:46.417 --> 00:36:48.053
Don't tell your mother.

381
00:36:49.354 --> 00:36:50.589
Okay?

382
00:37:04.435 --> 00:37:05.638
- Mitch?

383
00:39:00.986 --> 00:39:03.689
Ben? Oh. my God! Oh. my God.

384
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.862
What did they do to you?

385
00:39:12.197 --> 00:39:15.634
You did this. Mm-hmm.

386
00:39:18.737 --> 00:39:20.505
- I thought you were dead.

387
00:39:25.878 --> 00:39:27.613
I'm so sorry.

388
00:39:52.037 --> 00:39:56.108
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys?
Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:40:02.848 --> 00:40:04.149
- Charlie's vision.

390
00:40:05.184 --> 00:40:08.087
Dad dug Ben up...
out the ground.

391
00:40:14.793 --> 00:40:16.662
Why isn't he out yet?

392
00:40:23.302 --> 00:40:25.070
D'you give him the sedative?

393
00:40:25.104 --> 00:40:29.241
I tried. I tried...
I tried to give it to him.

394
00:40:29.274 --> 00:40:31.243
- Dad's losing patience.

395
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.615
- Huh.

396
00:40:37.282 --> 00:40:40.586
- Holy shit. Mom was right.

397
00:40:42.221 --> 00:40:43.956
You do love him.

398
00:40:47.726 --> 00:40:49.560
You know what?

399
00:40:52.598 --> 00:40:54.066
Give me the GHB.

400
00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:55.968
- No.
- I'll do it.
- No!

401
00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:59.038
No. I-I'll do it.
I'll do it. okay?
I'll do it.

402
00:41:33.872 --> 00:41:36.241
- Better not fuck this up. T.

403
00:42:05.037 --> 00:42:07.372
Fuck! Fuck.

404
00:42:08.207 --> 00:42:11.376
Charlie! Charlie. what do I do?
Please. what do I do?

405
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.113
Can you please fucking help me?
Please.

406
00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:23.288
Charlie. fucking help me. Fuck.

407
00:42:23.322 --> 00:42:25.724
What do I do? What...

408
00:43:03.362 --> 00:43:05.831
Cheers. Mitch.

409
00:43:05.864 --> 00:43:07.166
Fuck.

410
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.917
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. thank you.

411
00:43:26.752 --> 00:43:28.053
Thank you.

412
00:43:30.489 --> 00:43:32.257
Thank you! Thank you.

413
00:43:33.926 --> 00:43:37.196
It is my pleasure to accept
the vision award

For outstanding...

I've ensured
the beautiful people

418
00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:53.312
I've ensured the beautiful
people of Eastonville.

419

by the world!

Yes. dear?

What?

426
00:44:28.981 --> 00:44:30.415
Well. I do.

I-I'm gonna come tonight. okay?

428
00:44:37.823 --> 00:44:39.258
Oh. fuck.

429
00:44:45.364 --> 00:44:46.999
Ah!!!

430
00:45:00.613 --> 00:45:02.314
Oh. Charlie...

431
00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:04.783
Charlie...

432
00:45:05.984 --> 00:45:08.120

433
00:45:08.153 --> 00:45:10.922
is truly the night.
give me strength. Charlie.

Give me your charisma.

Charlie.

437
00:45:25.304 --> 00:45:28.874
Help my daughter make that...
right decision.

438
00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:31.910
My baby girl.

439
00:45:35.414 --> 00:45:37.149
Everything will be alright.

440
00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:41.453
Everything.

441
00:45:45.057 --> 00:45:46.325
Charlie...

442
00:45:48.293 --> 00:45:49.561
John.

443
00:45:59.204 --> 00:46:01.907
- Where the hell were you?
- Ah. Tiana.

444
00:46:02.675 --> 00:46:04.343
We gotta go right now.

445
00:46:04.376 --> 00:46:06.211
- Where did you find that?

446
00:46:06.244 --> 00:46:09.481
Mitch!
- In a fucking RV
half a mile away.

447
00:46:11.149 --> 00:46:12.984
Where is it. Tiana?
Where is it?!

448
00:46:13.018 --> 00:46:14.886
- No. no.
It's right here. sweetie.

449
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.488
It's right here.

450
00:46:21.493 --> 00:46:25.163
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch.
you were right.
There's somebody here. Yeah.

451
00:46:25.197 --> 00:46:27.032
- Okay. Alright.

452
00:46:30.235 --> 00:46:32.537
Fuck. Alright. Okay.

453
00:46:34.272 --> 00:46:36.074
- What is happening?

454
00:46:40.278 --> 00:46:41.980
- Oh. Jesus.

455
00:46:43.181 --> 00:46:45.016
What are you doing up?

456
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.570
- Me? What are you...
what are you doing outside.
running around?

457
00:46:48.387 --> 00:46:50.021
Mitch?

458
00:46:50.055 --> 00:46:51.591
- We're leaving. right now.

459
00:47:03.268 --> 00:47:05.370
I was gonna propose tomorrow.

460
00:47:06.004 --> 00:47:09.107
My ring...
it went missing yesterday.

461
00:47:09.141 --> 00:47:12.277
What the fuck is happening
right now?

462
00:47:13.078 --> 00:47:16.982
I went out tonight to find it.
I-I don't... What the fuck?

463
00:47:19.084 --> 00:47:20.720
- You... you were gonna...

464
00:47:20.753 --> 00:47:23.455
You were gonna...
you were gonna propose?

465
00:47:24.055 --> 00:47:27.492
- I had a plan and everything.
Whoever was back in the RV
obviously fucking stole it.

466
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:32.030
- - Mitch I... I don't... I...
- You don't what?

467
00:47:34.332 --> 00:47:36.168
- What else did you find?

468
00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:41.139
- Just a bunch of weird shit
in your... your script
and your... Fuck.

469
00:47:41.641 --> 00:47:45.210
And a bunch of pictures of you
with other guys?

470
00:47:46.445 --> 00:47:48.280
Why would he have pictures
of you?

471
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:50.716
- It's my brother.

472
00:47:51.684 --> 00:47:54.252
- What do you mean.
it's your brother?

473
00:47:54.286 --> 00:47:56.756
Tiana. you don't have a brother.
I need to pull over.

474
00:47:56.789 --> 00:48:00.091
- Just speed up
or he's gonna catch us. Mitch!
Speed now or he's...

475
00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:01.661
Speed up!

476
00:48:01.694 --> 00:48:04.996
- Chill the fuck out!
- Speed up! He's gonna catch us!
- Fuck!

477
00:48:06.498 --> 00:48:09.201
- What?

478
00:48:15.775 --> 00:48:19.177
- Got yourself another
basket case at New Hope. huh?

479
00:48:21.546 --> 00:48:22.715
- What?

480
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:26.251
- Poor bastard.

481
00:48:27.653 --> 00:48:29.120
- Travis?

482
00:48:29.154 --> 00:48:30.590
- Who else?

483
00:48:31.156 --> 00:48:33.024
- What is this?

484
00:48:33.759 --> 00:48:37.162
- Oh. this? Well... not sure.

485
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.132
My guess is it's somewhere
between the underworld
and the overworld.

486
00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:46.706
So you think it's gonna work
this time?

487
00:48:46.739 --> 00:48:48.240
- I don't know.

488
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:51.042
- Do you want it to?

489
00:49:08.126 --> 00:49:09.695
- She's alive!

490
00:49:11.196 --> 00:49:14.165
He ain't as bad off as you.
but. uh...

491
00:49:14.199 --> 00:49:18.570
wouldn't exactly call him a...
perfect vessel anymore.

492
00:49:20.138 --> 00:49:23.408
You know. part of me wishes
you wouldn't have made it
out here at all.

493
00:49:27.145 --> 00:49:29.682
You know. I do love you. sis.

494
00:49:30.482 --> 00:49:32.652
When they find out about this.
though...

495
00:49:39.357 --> 00:49:40.726
You know...

496
00:49:41.627 --> 00:49:44.396
you got it easy.
You know that?

497
00:49:44.429 --> 00:49:48.466
Living in L.A.. dating guys like
Captain fucking America here.

498
00:49:49.602 --> 00:49:51.536
You got it easy. you know that?

499
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.372
- Why are you talking like this?
Fucking just leave!

500
00:49:56.842 --> 00:50:00.813
- Because... I fucking...
like it.

501
00:50:02.314 --> 00:50:04.516
I'm out here
in the fuckin' desert.

502
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:07.452
confined to a basement doing
fucking science experiments.

503
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:09.554
and you're the fucking
favourite?!

504
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:13.124
- Please. Lucas. please. Lucas.
- No. no. no.

505
00:50:13.158 --> 00:50:14.860
You shut the fuck up. T!

506
00:50:19.464 --> 00:50:21.299
Left one in there for ya.

507
00:50:36.414 --> 00:50:38.383
When Charlie comes back
tonight...

508
00:50:39.517 --> 00:50:41.286
I'm not gonna lie to him.

509
00:50:42.788 --> 00:50:44.556
I will pray for you. though.

510
00:50:48.794 --> 00:50:50.495
- Lucas?!

511
00:50:51.262 --> 00:50:52.898
Lucas!

512
00:50:54.767 --> 00:50:56.669
Lucas!

513
00:50:56.702 --> 00:50:58.236
Fuck.

514
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.673
Mitch!

515
00:51:06.712 --> 00:51:08.279
Lucas!

516
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.357
Tiana!

517
00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.595
Tiana. open... open the door!

518
00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:24.362
<i>Go away.
- Open the door.</i>

519
00:51:24.396 --> 00:51:26.699
<i>- Mitch. go away!
Mitch. get out!</i>

520
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:30.402
Mitch. fucking leave.
Get out. please.

521
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:37.643
Not everyone can get over it
that easily. okay?

522
00:51:39.912 --> 00:51:41.747
Get out. Mitch!

523
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:44.315
Fucking say something!
Do you want to say anything?
Please?

524
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:46.619
<i>Fucking say something. Mitch!</i>

525
00:51:46.652 --> 00:51:49.588
<i>Get out! Get out! Go!</i>

526
00:51:50.623 --> 00:51:52.190
Get out.

527
00:52:15.313 --> 00:52:17.750
Mitch! Mitch!

528
00:52:42.808 --> 00:52:45.044
Ugh!

529
00:54:24.009 --> 00:54:26.477
- Okay. Okay.

530
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.816
Oh. my God. please forgive me?
Please?

531
00:54:37.189 --> 00:54:40.491
Come on. Mitch. Mitch. Mitch.
get up. get up. get up.
Come on. come on.

532
00:54:40.525 --> 00:54:42.493
We gotta get outta here.
My family's coming.

533
00:54:42.527 --> 00:54:45.396
- Your family?
- The family.
We need to go right now.

534
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:46.999
- You drugged me.

535
00:54:47.032 --> 00:54:51.436
- Fuck the drugs.
- No. I'm not going. Tiana.
I'm not fucking going anywhere!

536
00:54:51.469 --> 00:54:55.107
- I know you have no reason
to trust me.
I really need you to try.

537
00:55:06.752 --> 00:55:09.622
- Tiana. stop. What...
What are you doing?

538
00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:11.624
- I'm buying you time.

539
00:55:11.657 --> 00:55:13.058
- Huh?

540
00:55:13.826 --> 00:55:15.628
Hey! Why me?

541
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:19.164
Tiana. I asked you
a fucking question. huh!
You owe me that at least.

542
00:55:19.198 --> 00:55:20.866
- You're the perfect vessel.
Mitch.

543
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.635
- The perfect vessel?

544
00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:25.638
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:28.573 --> 00:55:31.043
<i>My dad is their leader.
They'll stop at nothing.</i>

546
00:55:31.076 --> 00:55:33.946
<i>They'll be here any minute.
You have to get outta here.</i>

547
00:55:33.979 --> 00:55:36.181
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

548
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:40.219
<i>And you actually think...</i>

549
00:55:40.252 --> 00:55:42.487
you can resurrect
Charles Manson?

550
00:55:43.022 --> 00:55:44.790
<i>You weren't the first one.</i>

551
00:55:45.791 --> 00:55:48.160
The guy in the cage? It was Ben.

552
00:55:49.962 --> 00:55:51.196
Mitch.

553
00:55:52.497 --> 00:55:54.833
Mitch! L-l-leave.

554
00:56:09.715 --> 00:56:11.549
- Was any of it real?

555
00:56:48.821 --> 00:56:50.555
- You killed our son.

556
00:57:32.965 --> 00:57:35.100
- Get up.
- Dad.

557
00:57:35.134 --> 00:57:38.771
Dad. Dad.
I tried to give him the GHB.
but he caught on.

558
00:57:38.804 --> 00:57:42.174
He... he started hitting me
and beating me and. Daddy.

559
00:57:42.207 --> 00:57:44.710
he stole the car
and he killed Lucas!

560
00:57:44.743 --> 00:57:47.713
- Get up. Get up.
- Dad. I'm sorry!

561
00:57:47.746 --> 00:57:49.348
- Get up.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

562
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:52.985
I'm sorry about the ritual
and Charlie. I'm sorry...

563
00:57:54.153 --> 00:57:56.889
Our son.
You killed my son.

564
00:57:59.191 --> 00:58:00.926
You killed our son.

565
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.000
- Annie.
- You were never meant
to play the part.

566
00:58:08.033 --> 00:58:10.602
- Annie. go wait outside.

567
00:58:12.337 --> 00:58:14.740
- not told you about the boy?

568
00:58:15.841 --> 00:58:17.810
- Go.
- I told you about the boy.

569
00:58:17.843 --> 00:58:19.611
- Annie.
- I told you about...
- Annie!

570
00:58:19.645 --> 00:58:21.180
- the boy!

571
00:58:26.819 --> 00:58:27.986
- Go.

572
00:58:28.787 --> 00:58:30.322
Let me do this.

573
00:58:44.336 --> 00:58:46.638
- I love him. Dad.

574
00:58:47.272 --> 00:58:48.841
- I know.

575
00:58:49.908 --> 00:58:51.376
I know.

576
00:58:54.947 --> 00:58:56.882
But what about your family?

577
00:58:58.183 --> 00:58:59.618
Our family.

578
00:59:00.385 --> 00:59:03.088
Your brother is gone.

579
00:59:06.992 --> 00:59:10.095
My son is dead. My son is dead.

580
00:59:13.332 --> 00:59:15.300
Tonight is the night. Tiana.

581
00:59:16.235 --> 00:59:17.970
Tonight is the night.

582
00:59:20.105 --> 00:59:21.840
Mitch is the vessel.

583
00:59:30.182 --> 00:59:32.217
You have committed a horrible.

584
00:59:32.251 --> 00:59:34.853
a horrible sin
against our family.

585
00:59:37.289 --> 00:59:38.924
Against Manson.

586
00:59:41.326 --> 00:59:43.162
Do you understand me?

587
00:59:43.929 --> 00:59:46.732
Look at me.

588
00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.935
I've given you too much!

589
00:59:56.308 --> 00:59:58.043
Hope he forgives us.

590
01:00:00.279 --> 01:00:02.781
Pray he forgives us.

591
01:00:05.484 --> 01:00:07.219
You give him a reason to.

592
01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:46.925
- Oh. oh. over here.
What is that?

593
01:00:53.498 --> 01:00:55.133
Call him. Tiana.

594
01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:57.502
- Mitch.
- I said call him loud.

595
01:00:58.403 --> 01:01:00.138
- Mitch. come on!

596
01:01:01.506 --> 01:01:03.408
Mitch. you're safe. baby!

597
01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:06.011
- Again.

598
01:01:06.044 --> 01:01:09.414
- Mitch! I don't know.
he won't fucking listen to me.

599
01:01:10.882 --> 01:01:14.453
- You know. Charlie watches.
he sees everything.
You know that. right?

600
01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:17.789
Hey. Mitch!

601
01:01:18.357 --> 01:01:19.825
Come out!

602
01:01:21.426 --> 01:01:23.795
Sonofabitch. Gimme that gun.

603
01:01:26.298 --> 01:01:28.900
Hey. Mitch.
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds.

604
01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:32.037
then I'm gonna blow
her pretty little head
off her skinny little body.

605
01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.439
- Dad...
- Mitch! Shhh.

606
01:01:35.474 --> 01:01:37.109
Don't speak.

607
01:01:37.843 --> 01:01:40.345
- Ten! Nine!

608
01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.549
I'm telling you Mitch.
I'm not fucking around!

609
01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.118
Eight!

610
01:01:49.921 --> 01:01:51.256
Seven!

611
01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:01.500
Oh. fuck it. One!

612
01:02:01.533 --> 01:02:05.037
Okay. okay. okay. okay!
- Go get... go get him!
- Oh-ho!

613
01:02:13.979 --> 01:02:15.514
Bring him over here.

614
01:02:23.188 --> 01:02:25.357
Now. if you'd just done
your job...

615
01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:30.596
- Oh. no. no. no.
What the fuck happened
to this guy. huh?

616
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.932
- Nothing special.
It's just some cuts and bruises.
He'll be fine.

617
01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:37.102
You're the one.
You the special boy.

618
01:02:38.437 --> 01:02:40.272
Come on. move.

619
01:04:01.721 --> 01:04:04.624
- Tiana. has he recited
Charlie's will?
- Yes.

620
01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:07.225
Yes. yeah.

621
01:04:07.259 --> 01:04:10.162
- Three times with vigour?
- Yes. yes.

622
01:04:11.496 --> 01:04:14.132
- Are you sure you're committed
to Charlie's will?

623
01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:17.068
Yes.

624
01:04:23.074 --> 01:04:25.977
- Then I think she's ready
for the mixture.

625
01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:02.581
Shhh. Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh...

626
01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:21.333
When Charlie wrote this
in prison.

627
01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:25.203
I don't think he had any idea
how dark the world
would become.

628
01:05:32.244 --> 01:05:35.146
This X on my forehead
signifies exile.

629
01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.215
Charlie was an exile.

630
01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.454
We're exiles...

631
01:05:42.487 --> 01:05:44.222
all of us.

632
01:05:49.294 --> 01:05:53.031
Cut off from the circle of life.
But I got good news.

633
01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.269
Tonight...

634
01:05:57.302 --> 01:05:59.605
on the day
of our lord's departure...

635
01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:03.441
we are gonna complete
the circle of life.

636
01:06:05.611 --> 01:06:08.748
We are gonna take
a day of sorrow
and turn it into celebration.

637
01:06:10.348 --> 01:06:12.250
Tonight is the night
of resurrection.

638
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.122
Tonight we complete the cycle.

639
01:06:24.764 --> 01:06:26.732
Charlie's will is Man's son.

640
01:06:27.299 --> 01:06:29.334
Charlie's will is Man's son.

641
01:06:29.367 --> 01:06:31.136
Charlie's will is Man's son.

642
01:06:31.169 --> 01:06:33.471
Charlie's will is Man's son.

643
01:06:33.505 --> 01:06:35.373
Charlie's will is Man's son.

644
01:06:35.407 --> 01:06:37.643
- Charlie's will is Man's son.

645
01:06:43.248 --> 01:06:45.083
Bring forth Charlie's ashes.

646
01:07:30.362 --> 01:07:31.897
The mixture's working.

647
01:07:34.499 --> 01:07:37.135
Let's cut him down
and put him in the box.

648
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.141
Charlie's coming home tonight.

649
01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:11.637
Tiana... you did it. baby.

650
01:08:13.939 --> 01:08:15.608
You did it.

651
01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:24.549
I want you to stand with me.
with us... your family.

652
01:08:37.495 --> 01:08:38.731
Tiana.

653
01:08:48.007 --> 01:08:49.574
- Robert.

654
01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:57.215
Robert.

655
01:08:58.818 --> 01:09:00.720
It's happening.

656
01:09:04.522 --> 01:09:05.958
It's happening.

657
01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:08.560
It's happening.

658
01:09:09.527 --> 01:09:11.496
It's happening.

659
01:09:13.498 --> 01:09:15.000
- Fucking pigs.

660
01:09:18.536 --> 01:09:20.005
Cops!

661
01:09:20.039 --> 01:09:22.641
Boom! Go. get 'em!

662
01:09:22.675 --> 01:09:25.878
- Weapons. weapons. weapons!
- Go. go. go!

663
01:09:27.579 --> 01:09:29.481
- Wake the fuck up!

664
01:09:29.514 --> 01:09:31.349
Fucking pigs.

665
01:09:31.382 --> 01:09:33.853
- Go! Go get him! Go. go. go!

666
01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.489
Ah!
- Go. go. go. go!

667
01:09:37.522 --> 01:09:39.491
Get off me!

668
01:09:39.524 --> 01:09:42.828
Shit. get off me!
- What the fuck. dude?!

669
01:09:42.862 --> 01:09:44.529
Get off him!

670
01:09:44.562 --> 01:09:46.732
Please.

671
01:10:00.378 --> 01:10:01.847
Please. Please.

672
01:10:03.515 --> 01:10:05.084
- Tiana!
- Please.

673
01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:06.752
- Mitch?

674
01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:34.780
That's when she. uh.
she fell on the floor and. um...

675
01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:40.451
and I laughed.
because I thought she was just
kinda feeling it. you know?

676
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:45.456
And. uh. I lay down next to her.
because. you know.

677
01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.393
I thought
we were just doing that.
whatever. and she. uh...

678
01:10:49.427 --> 01:10:51.030
And then I just kind of...

679
01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:53.498
I watched her die.

680
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.101
I fucking...

681
01:10:59.404 --> 01:11:01.640
Yeah. I was just...
I was so high.

682
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.943
I thought
it was part of the trip.

683
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.011
And...

684
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.483
I literally watched her...
choke on the floor
right in front of me.

685
01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:23.461
You know. I just...
I don't think I can...

686
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:26.699
go on like this anymore.

687
01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:31.569
I wish it was me instead of her.

688
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:38.576
Well... that's it.

689
01:11:42.513 --> 01:11:44.717
- Nothing's too big
