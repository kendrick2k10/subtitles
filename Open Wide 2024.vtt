00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.230
<i>The old phrase.</i>

4
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.983
<i>"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</i>

5
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.986
is false. That is not true.

6
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:36.411
<i>There is. no doubt.
a correct-shaped human face.</i>

7
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.415
<i>like there is with every other animal.</i>

8
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.126
<i>You know. cows all look the same.</i>

9
00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.878
<i>Sheep all look the same.</i>

10
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.922
{\an8}<i>Humans should all look the same.</i>

11
00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.048
{\an8}<i>but they don't.</i>

12
00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.675
{\an8}<i>They vary hugely.</i>

13
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.844
{\an8}<i>And sometimes</i>

14
00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:56.306
{\an8}<i>the shape of the face is appealing.</i>

15
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.975
and sometimes. shall we say. less so.

16
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.146
<i>What worries me is the fact</i>

17
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:07.484
<i>that most people are severely deformed.</i>

18
00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.653
It's a terrible thing to say.
but it's really true.

19
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.408
<i>Everybody is programmed</i>

20
00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.744
<i>to have the same type of face.</i>

21
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.330
Have you ever
taken a boat ride or a raft?

22
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.748
Yeah.

23
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.918
<i>But the development
of our face has gone wrong.</i>

24
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:28.004
{\an8}Pump. pump. pump.

25
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.841
{\an8}<i>We are no longer very beautiful.</i>

26
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.636
What was the worst part of the treatment?

27
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.305
<i>My job is to create
beautiful faces.</i>

28
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:42.268
<i>And anything you can do
to make the face better</i>

29
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.354
<i>is the right thing.</i>

30
00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.815
Was it as bad as you thought it would be?

31
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.943
I thought the treatment
would be a lot worse.

32
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.194
<i>People say. "John.</i>

33
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.822
<i>you create the best faces in the world."</i>

34
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.574
- Seashells on the...
- Seashore.

35
00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.868
- Brother.
- Brother.

36
00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.036
<i>The problem is.</i>

37
00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:03.540
<i>I'm too far ahead of everybody else.</i>

38
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:37.824
Okay. now get the head back.

39
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.867
Open nice and wide.

40
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:46.666
Open a bit wider.

41
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.295
Okay. cool. And then bite together.

42
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.509
{\an8}I actually stopped talking
about what I did

43
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.886
{\an8}at dinner parties.

44
00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.889
{\an8}because I'd go to a dinner party.

45
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.390
The normal thing happens.

46
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.558
Everyone says. "Oh. what do you do?"

47
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.102
And I go. "I'm--I'm-- I'm an orthodontist.

48
00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.562
but one of the most controversial."

49
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.440
<i>I spent my entire life</i>

50
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.817
with this knowledge in my brain

51
00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.194
that no one else seems to see.

52
00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.155
<i>You know. look at the car crash.</i>

53
00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.616
the slow motion car crash
that's happened to you.

54
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.618
Do you not see it?

55
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.330
<i>Modern orthodontics.
particularly fixed braces.</i>

56
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.082
<i>you're not affecting
the cause of the problem.</i>

57
00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.251
Actually. often.

58
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.462
you're making the underlying
situation worse.

59
00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.175
<i>People don't like to change.</i>

60
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:43.222
<i>We're comfortable in the skin we're in.
And I need to get people to change.</i>

61
00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:46.809
At this point.
if you remember from last time.

62
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.187
I always make them
look a little bit jaw-y.

63
00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.939
So the jaw. physically.

64
00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.649
should be slightly
further ahead of the top jaw.

65
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.861
'Cause this area here.
as he starts building his muscles up.

66
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.780
he's gonna lift this jaw up.

67
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.449
and this area is gonna go...

68
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.368
Out like that. Kay?

69
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:09.123
So if we get him here. up like that.
and we achieve that

70
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:13.544
in a sort of more harmonious structure.

71
00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:17.090
well. he'll have had.
I believe. to my knowledge.

72
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.342
one of the best facial
outcomes yet achieved.

73
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.428
<i>I've got this ability. I know.</i>

74
00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:25.765
<i>to transform lives immensely.
beyond reason.</i>

75
00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.145
Children that look like this

76
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.694
don't have the same lives.

77
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:43.157
either health-wise
or integrating with society

78
00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.868
and their peers. as people like this.

79
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:51.499
It has been really. really hard work.

80
00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.626
But we've only just got going.

81
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.680
- <i>Monday.</i>
- <i>Monday.</i>

82
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.223
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday.

83
00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.725
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday.

84
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.435
Now I start to need to change you.

85
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.895
Now. we change you with an appliance

86
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:15.857
that's got fangs on it like this. okay?

87
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.650
If she drops her jaw down.

88
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.320
the appliance engages
underneath the mandible.

89
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.532
and that will remind her
to keep her mouth closed.

90
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.868
building up this Pavlovian
feedback response.

91
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.910
And that's what we want.

92
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.163
<i>Life is full of surprises.</i>

93
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.832
<i>The fact that the internet got me famous</i>

94
00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.877
<i>is one of those things. I guess.</i>

95
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.087
<i>This term mewing. the whole mewing thing</i>

96
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.840
<i>has been an absolute gift to me.</i>

97
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.676
<i>It's a godsend. It's named after me.</i>

98
00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.386
{\an8}<i>My surname has become a verb now.</i>

99
00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.513
{\an8}<i>It's a massively used term.</i>

100
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.975
<i>Someone pointed out to me recently</i>

101
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.436
<i>that the hashtag #mewing has been seen</i>

102
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.314
<i>over a billion times on TikTok.</i>

103
00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.357
<i>That blows me away.</i>

104
00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.401
I stagger. How am I in this place?

105
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.403
I mean. how did I get here?

106
00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.480
Right.

107
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.440
I'm gonna kind of stick
my legs out there a little.

108
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.026
Well. get your feet in.
You could pull the chair.

109
00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.945
Well. I think they've now set up on us.

110
00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.823
- So the last--
- Are our heads close enough together?

111
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.908
I have abs-- I'm sure they'll give us
some instructions.

112
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.284
They will.

113
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.662
You look to be
quite a way away. that's all.

114
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.289
Yeah. Well. I'm waiting for instruction.

115
00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.999
- So...
- Right.

116
00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.127
I really think it's gonna be
a nice. sunny day today.

117
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.920
Excuse me.

118
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.213
Don't feel shy about--

119
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.798
- May we begin?
- Yes.

120
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.135
So what's it like
to be a father/son team?

121
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.595
I'd never thought about it.

122
00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.723
- What do you--
- I don't see myself as a team.

123
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:17.728
I see myself as a chap
who likes orthodontics

124
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.231
with a son who's interested
in orthodontics.

125
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.900
Yeah. Yes. you see. you are an individual.

126
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.152
- Oh.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.987
You're not the best
team player in the world.

128
00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.738
- Well. probably not.
- No. no.

129
00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:29.907
I don't think we work together.

130
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.953
There we go.
I think that about sums it up.

131
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.455
- Well. no.
- I've been trying for years

132
00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:39.459
to get him to work with me.
but he does his own thing.

133
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.295
I've never-- Don't think
I've ever had a different thought.

134
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:52.513
<i>At the age of 16.
I had a little black book.</i>

135
00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:54.223
{\an8}only about that big.

136
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:58.686
{\an8}â™ªWhenever I had significant thoughts.
I would note them down.

137
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:02.940
<i>And so I spent most of my life puzzling</i>

138
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.902
<i>on the reason for this or that or center.</i>

139
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:10.323
<i>I was not a good student.</i>

140
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.284
<i>I regularly failed my exams.</i>

141
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:16.037
<i>And I really don't think
I'm at all clever.</i>

142
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.955
<i>Quite stupid. in fact.</i>

143
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:22.376
<i>But interestingly. I had this ability to--</i>

144
00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:25.171
<i>I think they call it lateral thinking.</i>

145
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.590
Therefore. I was always
coming up with ideas

146
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.593
which were entirely different
than everyone else's.

147
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.183
Traditional truths are not always correct.

148
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.227
I think I see myself as a rebel.

149
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.439
<i>Once you've come up with the answer.</i>

150
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.524
<i>you know it's right.</i>

151
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.401
<i>And of course. that's my problem now.</i>

152
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.028
<i>I know I'm right.</i>

153
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.031
<i>The orthodontists are
absolutely sure I'm wrong.</i>

154
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.952
Could you sit up a little for me?

155
00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.453
Oh. so sorry. yes.

156
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.705
- I keep slithering down.
- No. no. not at all.

157
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.916
I'm-- Remember my age. son.

158
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:08.214
<i>A delicate subject
to talk about other people.</i>

159
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.633
<i>particularly about their faces.</i>

160
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.844
So one does need to tread carefully.

161
00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:17.640
But if you walk down the street.
you'll find a huge number of people

162
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.433
who just have flat faces.

163
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.687
Now. most people think.
"Well. I've just got a flat face."

164
00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:27.483
But there's a reason for that.
There's a reason for everything.

165
00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.945
<i>I spent most of my life</i>

166
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.114
<i>studying faces.</i>

167
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:37.326
<i>I decided I wanted to be a dentist
way back. before I was ten.</i>

168
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:43.833
<i>My father. he was an orthodontist.
so obviously enjoyed it.</i>

169
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.003
that it seemed natural
for me to do the same thing.

170
00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:52.341
<i>I started off
very much part of the establishment.</i>

171
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:56.345
<i>But I was unhappy with the effect</i>

172
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.973
<i>of orthodontic treatment on youngsters.</i>

173
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.977
<i>They were purely mechanical cures.</i>

174
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.229
They would say. "Look.
these teeth are all there.

175
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:06.647
We'll fix it."

176
00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:10.901
And the dentists found that if they fitted
a plate with bits of wire on it.

177
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.237
<i>they could line the teeth up.</i>

178
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:14.697
<i>Fix the palate. see.</i>

179
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:15.990
<i>See. my belief are</i>

180
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.409
<i>they're doing more harm than good.</i>

181
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:24.415
The whole orthodontic scene is a scandal.

182
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:47.813
<i>Most orthodontic treatment flattens faces.</i>

183
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:51.233
In reality. it pulls them back.

184
00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.944
which is the exact opposite
of what you want.

185
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:58.032
<i>It's a bit like taking a cardboard box.</i>

186
00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.242
<i>If you push it in.</i>

187
00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:02.578
it kinks and cracks and twists.

188
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.538
Well. the face is just the same.

189
00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:07.333
If it's pushed back at one end.
it kinks like this.

190
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:12.338
<i>It's better to try and lodge the jaws
to take the whole lot forward.</i>

191
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.590
which also provides room for the teeth.

192
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.429
<i>My dear wife. Jo. and I
were treated traditionally.</i>

193
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:24.392
<i>We both have narrow faces
and crowded teeth.</i>

194
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:31.065
<i>I really wanted to bring my children up
without traditional orthodontic methods.</i>

195
00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:36.195
<i>And so I thought I'd design
an appliance to do that.</i>

196
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.368
<i>I don't know if you've done much.
what they say. "DIY."</i>

197
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.871
<i>do it yourself. but it's very convenient</i>

198
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.416
<i>to be able to experiment on your children.</i>

199
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.920
Most people do it socially.
but I also did it medically.

200
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:10.771
{\an8}<i>William. my older one.
I was just forming these ideas.</i>

201
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:14.275
{\an8}<i>It wasn't effective. and as a result.</i>

202
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.111
{\an8}<i>has never had good facial development.</i>

203
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.740
{\an8}<i>But Michael was the next one in line.</i>

204
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.909
{\an8}<i>You can see that his face</i>

205
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.786
{\an8}<i>is totally different from mine.</i>

206
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:29.874
{\an8}<i>It was mainly that
I was just clever about him.</i>

207
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.002
{\an8}<i>-And Rosarie...</i>
- Hey.

208
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.129
{\an8}<i>His younger sister.</i>

209
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.673
{\an8}<i>I think even cleverer still. you know.</i>

210
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.342
You do get a bit better in life with luck.

211
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:46.807
As the eldest. I was the first guinea pig.

212
00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:49.727
And therefore. some of
the contraptions I wore

213
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.270
were possibly a little bit more crude.

214
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:56.901
{\an8}I remember Bill being
taped up to this headgear

215
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.445
that an alarm used to go off
if his mouth fell open.

216
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.697
Well. initially. they hadn't
got the alarm quite right.

217
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:04.575
so before he reali--
there was something underneath

218
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:05.784
with a sharp object there.

219
00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.872
If my jaw dropped. it would be--

220
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.582
I would describe it as uncomfortable.

221
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.002
{\an8}Poor William.

222
00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:17.713
He wore that very well
and never complained.

223
00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.089
None of them complained.

224
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:23.135
<i>We were fair game for experimentation.</i>

225
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.471
<i>Oh. I'm sure that he'd be done now.</i>

226
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.639
<i>for the amount of experimenting</i>

227
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.224
<i>that he did on us.</i>

228
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.559
<i>One of his experiments was to see</i>

229
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.770
what would happen to facial development

230
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.940
if someone didn't chew.
So if someone just swallowed

231
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.610
and just did. like. baby food
for the first three years--

232
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.736
two. maybe three years.

233
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:42.404
Let's be generous.
There was only two and half years.

234
00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:45.658
Pretending it was breastfeeding.
as if you were breastfeeding.

235
00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.659
Yes.

236
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.955
<i>We used to breastfeed children
for two to three years.</i>

237
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.415
<i>We now do it for less than six months.</i>

238
00:13:54.959 --> 00:14:00.798
It is one of the biggest lifestyle changes
that we've made in the human race.

239
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:06.220
And I'm sure it's the main reason
why there are so many ugly people around.

240
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.807
Everyone would have their Sunday dinner.

241
00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.559
and mine would have gone
through the Magimix.

242
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.435
And I'd be given this bottle.

243
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:15.813
and I just thought
it was completely normal

244
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:19.984
that I had. as Dad always talks about.
one of the largest malocclusions ever.

245
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.402
- Yes.
- Because I had

246
00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.821
- It was a disaster.
- this tiny. tiny little jaw

247
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.781
because I hadn't chewed.

248
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.658
So he wrote lots of research papers.

249
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.243
And I think my mother. I was about three.

250
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.328
and sort of said.
"Right. we're going to start

251
00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:32.830
giving her ordinary food now.

252
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.373
So then he was very excited.

253
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.625
But then he started putting a brace in me.

254
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:41.171
And he created the largest expansion
that he'd ever done on anyone before.

255
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.882
because I went from this very.
very crowded malocclused...

256
00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:45.301
- Is that the right word?
- Malocclusion. yeah.

257
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.679
...place to quite a big jaw.
as I have now. so...

258
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.389
So he created the problem and--

259
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.891
- Well. he didn't mean
- And then fixed it.

260
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.892
<i>to create the problem.</i>

261
00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:57.396
<i>My daughter. Rosarie.
has a very good-looking face.</i>

262
00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:00.399
I mean. she's--
I hate to think how old now.

263
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.901
She must be in her late 50s.

264
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:07.364
No. she'd probably be horrified.
No. I think. late 40s. perhaps.

265
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.158
Not very good on ages.

266
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:12.286
Anyway. but she's got
lovely bone formation.

267
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.165
I experimented on my children.
and it worked.

268
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.251
I'm sure I should be put
in prison for that.

269
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.465
<i>The human. when brought up naturally.</i>

270
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.759
<i>has no dental problems.</i>

271
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.928
<i>If a parent asks me.</i>

272
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.180
<i>"John. what's the best way I can do</i>

273
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.890
<i>to look after my children</i>

274
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.268
and make sure
that they grow up correctly?"

275
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.479
I will say this simply.

276
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:44.068
"Sell your house.
buy a cave in the top of a mountain.

277
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:47.404
and don't cook any of your food."

278
00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:50.240
and I think that's
a very good prescription.

279
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:57.873
<i>John has created an island for himself.</i>

280
00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:01.752
{\an8}And in that island. I think I'm there.

281
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.629
{\an8}I think Mike's there.

282
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:06.799
{\an8}And it gets a bit hazy after that.

283
00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:12.012
<i>My journey to orthotropics
has not been a straight line.</i>

284
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:15.391
I was studying conventional orthodontics.

285
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.978
<i>and I came across John's philosophy.</i>

286
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.231
<i>I have been trained through John.</i>

287
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:27.027
<i>and I follow John's technique
very closely.</i>

288
00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:33.033
One of the things that he answered for me
was why there is malocclusion.

289
00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.162
<i>which is when the teeth
end up out of alignment</i>

290
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.248
<i>and they grow crooked.</i>

291
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:45.963
<i>Human beings. we've always had jaws
and teeth that are fairly evenly balanced</i>

292
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.506
<i>and fairly straight.</i>

293
00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:50.551
<i>In the last 300 years.
that has really shifted.</i>

294
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.681
<i>We live in a world today
where no one has straight teeth.</i>

295
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.142
<i>And so how do we go from</i>

296
00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.852
tens and tens and tens
of thousands of years

297
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.562
where everything was perfect

298
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:04.481
to one where every kid needs
some form of braces

299
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.858
to get the teeth straight?

300
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:12.114
<i>We're taught that genetics
plays the primary role</i>

301
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.242
<i>in jaw development.
and John's thought was.</i>

302
00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:20.873
it's not possible
for genetics to be so precise.

303
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:26.211
for everything to line up perfectly
without any environmental influence.

304
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:28.047
- Have you got fingerprint?
- No.

305
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.673
I've just got the facial recognition.

306
00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:31.467
Look at the phone. Nothing's happening.

307
00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:32.718
Put it close to your face.

308
00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.512
Did it open?

309
00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.264
No. it doesn't recognize me.

310
00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:40.184
But I bet you get voice recognition.

311
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.395
- See. it opened.
- Yeah. that's interesting.

312
00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.688
Yeah. see. he's altered her jaw.

313
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:46.231
so I now can't get into her phone.

314
00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:49.651
Yeah.

315
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:54.406
I didn't know it wasn't
traditional. you know. orthodontistry.

316
00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.408
I thought I was getting
orthodontic treatment.

317
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.577
I had no idea that...

318
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.120
that I was one of the first people

319
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.831
that he was going to try
this procedure on.

320
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.627
<i>We grew up on a farm.</i>

321
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:10.339
<i>His surgery was a long way.
and it was down country lanes.</i>

322
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.802
<i>We had a working class background.
He was a private dentist.</i>

323
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.887
So he was a different strata to us.

324
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.601
We were always the twinnies. the twins.

325
00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.520
She's twinny. I'm twinny.

326
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.605
{\an8}We're absolutely identical.

327
00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:30.192
{\an8}Not so much now.
but we used to be totally identical.

328
00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.443
couldn't tell us apart.

329
00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.570
- I mean. we were just...
- Joined at the hip.

330
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.781
- Yes.
- Apart from the teeth.

331
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:39.993
<i>I was really conscious of my teeth.</i>

332
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.789
<i>We both sucked our finger and thumb
from when we were little girls</i>

333
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.416
<i>until probably early teens.</i>

334
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:47.376
Like that.

335
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.341
<i>I had. you know. an overbite.</i>

336
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.093
<i>I remember being teased on the bus.</i>

337
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:58.804
and. you know. I used to get called Lucky

338
00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.722
'cause I had this big gap
in the middle of my teeth.

339
00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:02.474
I used to be able to get a penny in.

340
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.769
<i>So I never used to smile much.
and I was very conscious of my mouth.</i>

341
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:08.021
- But you did smile. but you did this.
- All the time.

342
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.606
Like. I would always be like this
in the photographs.

343
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.112
<i>We used to babysit for Dr. Mew.</i>

344
00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.489
<i>and I can't remember how it came up</i>

345
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.909
that he wanted to do
a treatment on my teeth.

346
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:24.621
Well. he only took one look at you
and realized you needed something doing.

347
00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:26.915
Thank you. Yes. anyway.

348
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:30.752
You would have been a perfect patient.
of course. 'cause you had a control.

349
00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.713
Exactly. you're my control.

350
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.673
which is probably why
we got the free dentistry.

351
00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.967
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.468
That's exactly why.

353
00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:39.595
- That is why?
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.847
- You owe it all to me. Moi.
- Ha. there you go.

355
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:50.230
<i>When you want to do good research.</i>

356
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.024
<i>no doubt. twins is the best way.</i>

357
00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:55.110
If you take a pair of twins and treat one

358
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.030
with one method
and one with another method.

359
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.990
you're going to get a very clear message.

360
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.244
because when you're treating twins.
they're both the same.

361
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.085
{\an8}<i>I had an appliance.</i>

362
00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.962
And it was called the Biobloc.

363
00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:17.549
It was like a medieval torture instrument.

364
00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.555
<i>And I had to sleep with my bottom teeth</i>

365
00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:27.601
pulled out to almost
in front of my top teeth.

366
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:32.522
<i>which isn't pleasant.
But I had great confidence in him</i>

367
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.691
<i>because he was so confident.</i>

368
00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:37.861
And I would do whatever it took
to finish that treatment.

369
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:39.529
which is what I did.

370
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.992
<i>My mouth did change.</i>

371
00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:48.455
<i>I mean. the gap in the front of my teeth
wasn't there anymore.</i>

372
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:51.041
<i>I felt far more confident about smiling.</i>

373
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.126
<i>So it was wonderful for me.</i>

374
00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:55.796
<i>You know. it was the best thing
I could ever have done.</i>

375
00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.966
I'd probably still be living
at Heart Lake farm

376
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:02.052
if I hadn't had it done.
married with five children.

377
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.264
Okay. stop.

378
00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:11.103
{\an8}<i>They became the first
of a series of six twins</i>

379
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.855
{\an8}<i>who had had different treatment.</i>

380
00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:17.442
Elise. the twin
on the right in this picture

381
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.986
who does not need treatment.

382
00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:22.322
has a larger and more pragmatic face.

383
00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:23.657
Probably because of this.

384
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:27.244
her face looks more mature
than that of her sister.

385
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:33.667
Because I really wanted
to know the truth myself.

386
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:37.629
I didn't know if orthotropics
was better or worse.

387
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.258
<i>I could then compare them.</i>

388
00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:43.760
and I was flabbergasted.

389
00:21:47.514 --> 00:21:50.517
<i>I said. "Eureka! That's obviously it."</i>

390
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:54.730
<i>And that was when I really produced</i>

391
00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:00.193
<i>the label "orthotropics."
which means correct growth.</i>

392
00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:07.284
<i>All plants are guided by tropisms.</i>

393
00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:10.954
<i>where they will grow towards the light.</i>

394
00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:14.416
<i>So growth is a tropism.</i>

395
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:18.045
<i>Plants grow. and in a way. so do faces.</i>

396
00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.759
<i>What orthotropics is about</i>

397
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.678
<i>is redirecting the course of growth.</i>

398
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:31.433
<i>It's very easy to start.
terribly difficult to finish.</i>

399
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.643
Initially. you're making room for teeth.

400
00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:38.565
It's a very spectacular.
very appealing period.

401
00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.358
The next phase of orthotropics

402
00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:44.237
<i>is where we develop the individual jaws</i>

403
00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:47.074
<i>to be the incorrect shape.</i>

404
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:50.452
<i>And what tends to happen
is parents then say.</i>

405
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.079
"This doctor has no idea
what they're doing.

406
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:55.665
and it is infinitely worse
than when we first started."

407
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:59.377
And then they will take them
to find a second opinion.

408
00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:05.217
And they will say. "What has this man.
what has this woman done to your child?

409
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.761
They've wrecked your child."

410
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:11.348
The problem with orthotropics
is it looks good.

411
00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.308
then it looks terrible.

412
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:15.727
and that lasts four years.

413
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.690
And then finally at the end of it.
it looks great.

414
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:25.737
Right. I let people know.
"This is a double black diamond."

415
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:28.949
<i>If we travel here. you have to trust.</i>

416
00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:32.744
in the end. you'll end up
in a fantastic place.

417
00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.748
<i>We are training children</i>

418
00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:39.000
<i>to work at a level</i>

419
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.129
{\an8}<i>which is beyond what
we would normally expect.</i>

420
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.463
{\an8}Come take a seat.

421
00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.799
{\an8}<i>The level of physical discipline</i>

422
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:51.263
{\an8}requires a commitment
that is not common today.

423
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.932
You have to train not only the children.

424
00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:56.685
but their guardians. the parents.

425
00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:59.813
Why was it you came
for treatment. actually?

426
00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:04.568
Because I felt that recently.
Lisa's lower jaw was receding more.

427
00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.529
{\an8}<i>We are talking
specifically about posture.</i>

428
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:12.784
{\an8}<i>You cannot develop straight teeth
if you have bad oral posture.</i>

429
00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:15.412
How much do you hope
that this can be improved?

430
00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:18.373
Well. I hope that her jawline
would look more normal

431
00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:20.167
and that cosmetically

432
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:24.129
it would improve the outline
of her face and her jaw.

433
00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:28.175
In orthotropics. we have appliances

434
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.802
that have a penalty nature to them.

435
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.265
This is your stage three appliance. Lisa.

436
00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:38.560
and it's intended that it will be sore
if you drop the jaw down.

437
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.646
<i>When John developed orthotropics.</i>

438
00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.523
<i>he developed it in a world</i>

439
00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:47.027
<i>where there were physical penalties
and punishments</i>

440
00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:49.571
when you didn't behave.

441
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:53.575
You know. I was smacked as a child.
I was smacked at school.

442
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:56.786
Six. seven. eight. nine. ten.

443
00:24:56.786 --> 00:24:58.496
That's very good. indeed. Well done.

444
00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:01.499
<i>One of the things about human beings</i>

445
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:05.795
is physical reminders trump
verbal nagging.

446
00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:10.800
And that's how we change habits.

447
00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:15.263
Those years that I went through treatment.

448
00:25:15.263 --> 00:25:18.558
<i>from the age. I think.
eight or nine through to 12.</i>

449
00:25:18.558 --> 00:25:21.436
And my brother had to go down
the traditional route

450
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.146
as a control.

451
00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:26.399
<i>And obviously. for John Mew.
the ability then to do that comparison.</i>

452
00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:27.817
<i>compare and contrast.</i>

453
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:31.404
The experience I had. it was quite brutal.

454
00:25:31.404 --> 00:25:34.783
<i>When I look back at it. I look back
and think it was just natural.</i>

455
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.576
<i>It was just part
of what I was going through.</i>

456
00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:39.663
{\an8}And everybody else was going through it.
if they have orthodontistry.

457
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:41.831
{\an8}But I now know that wasn't the case.

458
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:42.999
{\an8}So...

459
00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:47.045
Yeah. we as children
didn't really question why.

460
00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:51.299
If he convinces the parent
that this is the right thing.

461
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:53.593
then the parents can be the overseer

462
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:57.347
and govern that the child does
what they're supposed to do.

463
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:59.516
um. which is kind of what happened.

464
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.851
- Your mom was overseeing?
- Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.186
She was supervising.
wasn't she?

466
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.940
Oh. you'd like to-- That's wonderful.

467
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.984
We're talking about parents and children.

468
00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.819
Come on in. We'll figure it out.

469
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:12.612
- Yeah.
- What do you want to say?

470
00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:14.823
Thank you for joining us.

471
00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.992
I know this may seem--

472
00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:18.785
Do you want to sit here?

473
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.037
- I could sit on the--
- Is that okay?

474
00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:25.583
{\an8}Yeah. yeah. No. that's it. Just...

475
00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:30.171
{\an8}- Why don't you sit here?
- I just wanted to mention

476
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:33.717
when you were talking about
the responsibility with the parents.

477
00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:38.388
um. it came to the stage
where Quentin's teeth

478
00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:43.268
were so far out and his jaw so far back.

479
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.562
he couldn't possibly
have been left like that.

480
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:49.232
I had horrors that John Mew
would drop down dead

481
00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:51.735
and he'd be like. "Ah. ah. ah."

482
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:55.363
Yeah. so I couldn't really say.

483
00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:58.700
you know. "This is too much."
because we were in it too deep.

484
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.995
But it was quite scary. It really was.

485
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:04.748
Ooh. Yeah.

486
00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.791
So really. you're very lucky.

487
00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:08.793
Well. it could have all gone
horribly wrong.

488
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:09.919
- Yeah.
- Yeah. true.

489
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.547
Could have been left with just the top.

490
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:15.800
What's happened to their faces?

491
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.552
Well. you can see that Ben's face

492
00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.513
is slightly flatter and slightly longer.

493
00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:23.141
whereas Quentin has more forward growth.

494
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.478
which I think perhaps gives
him a slightly better profile.

495
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.730
Twin studies. does that ring a bell?

496
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:34.235
{\an8}John Mew actually doing a study on twins
doesn't exist.

497
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:36.571
{\an8}He worked with six sets of twins.

498
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:40.283
Yes? Six sets of twins or six--

499
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:41.826
Yes. that's 12 people.

500
00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:47.415
Twelve patients does not
a study make. ever.

501
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:54.589
<i>I used to be an academic orthodontist.
and I started my career in London.</i>

502
00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:56.674
which is actually where I met John Mew.

503
00:27:56.674 --> 00:28:00.136
<i>I've known John Mew since the '60s.</i>

504
00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:02.806
My first interaction with Dr. Mew--

505
00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:05.725
why do I call him Dr. Mew? Mr. Mew--

506
00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:09.229
<i>was when I was at the London
Hospital Medical School.</i>

507
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.398
I was in charge
of the orthodontic department.

508
00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:17.362
<i>And one of my jobs
was to evaluate submissions</i>

509
00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.989
<i>for an essay competition.</i>

510
00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:22.617
<i>Mew put in his submission.</i>

511
00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:27.163
It was just as bad as everything else
he's written since.

512
00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:30.291
Uh. fanciful. no science. no nothing.

513
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.047
<i>I remember it
because it was a curious submission.</i>

514
00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:40.552
<i>It had two illustrations.
and there were two fish tanks</i>

515
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:43.471
<i>with a bunch of trout in one of them</i>

516
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:46.558
and no trout in the other. okay?

517
00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:50.728
And the caption had something
to do with the fact that.

518
00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:56.359
please observe how the trout's
snout anatomy changed

519
00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:59.779
because they were pressing
their face against the glass

520
00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:01.406
of the fish tank.

521
00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.867
And so that was his argument.

522
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:08.288
which I had to reject.
because it had no science in it.

523
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.290
So the next thing I know
is he telephoned me

524
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.418
and wanted to come and see me
at the London Hospital.

525
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:19.215
And he accused me
of suppressing his reality and his truth

526
00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:23.011
<i>because I disagreed with his premises.</i>

527
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:26.139
<i>I said. I don't disagree
with your premise.</i>

528
00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:28.850
<i>I just disagree with crappy science.</i>

529
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:34.189
I don't care who you are. you know?
He didn't like to hear that either.

530
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:47.535
<i>It's never easy to change
people's ideas. so I tried.</i>

531
00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:50.038
<i>I wrote papers. I gave meetings.</i>

532
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:53.583
I gave lectures.
I had long chats with people.

533
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:56.961
I'd pull people into a corner
and browbeat them.

534
00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.339
You know. the usual things.

535
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:02.509
I was just hoping to reason with people

536
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.845
and they'd see the truth
or the light. as I might say.

537
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.685
<i>It's what every parent
wants for their child.</i>

538
00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:14.812
<i>a perfect smile.</i>

539
00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:17.690
<i>But does that smile mask a hidden danger?</i>

540
00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.821
<i>I didn't push it</i>

541
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:26.407
<i>until a program called</i> Dispatches.

542
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.955
<i>If my views were accepted.</i>

543
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:34.958
orthodontics would
have to change dramatically.

544
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:39.254
And indeed. many people would either
have to change the way they worked

545
00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:41.589
or give up doing orthodontics.

546
00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:48.263
But there's a clear comparison between us
as twins in favor

547
00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:50.431
of the orthodontistry method
of Dr. Mew's. right?

548
00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:51.808
And how do you feel about that?

549
00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:55.395
In hindsight. I would have preferred
to gone with Mr. Mew's method.

550
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:58.439
That was on national television.

551
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:01.693
And the next day. every single one

552
00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:04.946
of the English national dailies

553
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:09.909
had <i>half or full-page articles
on what I'd said.</i>

554
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:15.748
The orthodontists all thought
that I behaved absolutely appallingly.

555
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:19.377
Essentially. I had been
a traitor to the cause.

556
00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:23.256
<i>And they said.
"You'll shatter people's faith</i>

557
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:26.134
<i>and make them think
orthodontics is no good."</i>

558
00:31:26.134 --> 00:31:29.262
which. in a way. was what I was trying
to tell them anyway.

559
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.972
From then on.

560
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:34.434
I was always in conflict
with orthodontics.

561
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:37.604
There was really no option. was there?

562
00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:44.861
A leading London dentist claims
current orthodontic methods

563
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:47.906
sometimes straighten the teeth.
but they then ruin the face.

564
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:51.284
That's at the center of a bitter row
in the world of orthodontics.

565
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:54.287
Can you see the two
sharp spikes on that plate?

566
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.581
Well. I got very angry. I looked at it.

567
00:31:56.581 --> 00:32:00.126
I could not believe someone
could put that in a child's mouth.

568
00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:03.046
I'm accusing all the people
who treat your way

569
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:06.424
of ripping off the parents.
And it's child abuse.

570
00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:10.720
I provide them appliance
which is designed to hurt

571
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.472
if the child drops their jaw.

572
00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:16.267
You might call that child abuse.
I would call it training.

573
00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:17.226
That's crap.

574
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:23.566
The establishment were initially hoping
that when he reached

575
00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:28.321
sort of the age of 60 or something.
he would either retire or sort of mellow.

576
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.782
Um. if anything.
the opposite has happened.

577
00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:34.869
<i>He was still poking the beast
year after year after year.</i>

578
00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:37.830
I've even been threatened
with assault at meetings.

579
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.626
People hate me with a depth
that's really quite surprising.

580
00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.964
<i>I even went to the length
of marching up and down</i>

581
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:52.595
<i>the principal medical area in London
with a big sandwich board</i>

582
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:56.391
<i>saying what I thought about orthodontics.</i>

583
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.434
<i>It was words to the effect</i>

584
00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:03.314
that orthodontics damages faces.
which is true.

585
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:12.782
<i>On the cover of your book.
you have the Galileo quote.</i>

586
00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:15.660
<i>Oh. yeah.</i> "Eppur si muove."

587
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.414
<i>Galileo said that in a loud whisper...</i>

588
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.794
<i>...as he turned his back on the Pope.</i>

589
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:27.338
And he very nearly lost his life for that.

590
00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:31.467
Essentially. he was talking
about the world and the sun.

591
00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:33.845
<i>He was saying the world moves.</i>

592
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:37.598
<i>And I put the same phrase
in relation to the jaws.</i>

593
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:45.523
Of course. the orthodontists
didn't quite see that.

594
00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:50.945
They saw it that I was treating patients
in an improper way.

595
00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:55.366
So the orthodontists approached
the General Dental Council.

596
00:33:55.366 --> 00:34:00.371
the authority which grants
licenses in England.

597
00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.874
and said. "Look. this man's
doing the wrong thing.

598
00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.667
We've got to stop him."

599
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.502
So three years ago.

600
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:10.423
I had my license
to practice dentistry removed.

601
00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.427
<i>They really felt
they needed to strike him off</i>

602
00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:17.013
<i>in order to try and besmirch him.</i>

603
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:20.099
<i>But I think possibly
the biggest shock in store</i>

604
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:22.852
<i>was that there simply wasn't just one Mew.</i>

605
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:25.396
<i>There's--there's another one
following in his footsteps.</i>

606
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:33.905
<i>Mike. specifically.</i>

607
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:36.741
has taken over the family business.

608
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.326
- The mantle.
- The mantle.

609
00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:39.368
The mantle. as Mom would say.

610
00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:41.954
I would say--I would say
the sort of noose around the neck.

611
00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:46.959
- I love that.
- He's taken on that big challenge.

612
00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:54.759
<i>You know. you used to have.
the plowman would do what his father did.</i>

613
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:57.136
<i>You know. the plowman's son
would become a plowman.</i>

614
00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:59.305
<i>And that became your universe.</i>

615
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:03.101
And in a way. what my father
did became my universe.

616
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:05.228
<i>And it was at a very young age.</i>

617
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.979
<i>I decided I was gonna do this.</i>

618
00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:11.901
Michael turned to me and said. "Rosie.

619
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.487
I think I might slowly
be turning into Dad."

620
00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:17.782
And I said. "What do you mean.
'turning into'?

621
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:20.159
You've been there
for about ten years already."

622
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:21.577
- There's been a Mini-Me.
- Mini-Me.

623
00:35:21.577 --> 00:35:23.955
<i>There's been a Mini-Me
following in Dad's footsteps.</i>

624
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:29.585
He's not your average father.

625
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.882
<i>Few people have fathers like I do.</i>

626
00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:39.470
<i>You know. he is just a--
you know. he's an inspiration.</i>

627
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:45.601
Bye.

628
00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:52.483
<i>Seeing my father being
attacked and criticized</i>

629
00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:56.863
<i>has been one of the things
that's driven me forwards.</i>

630
00:35:56.863 --> 00:36:00.825
<i>It just makes your blood boil...</i>

631
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:07.123
<i>'cause I've seen my father
just be destroyed.</i>

632
00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:10.543
Reverse. reverse. reverse.
Full throttle. Full throttle.

633
00:36:15.047 --> 00:36:18.509
I didn't think that
I could study orthodontics

634
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.469
in the UK because

635
00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:23.139
everyone so vehemently disagrees
with my father.

636
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:25.808
<i>And that's one of the reasons
I went to Denmark.</i>

637
00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:29.312
<i>I chose Denmark. being. you know.
one of the top orthodontic programs</i>

638
00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:30.354
<i>on the planet.</i>

639
00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:34.859
<i>But I just. you know. I shudder
at what they were teaching me at times.</i>

640
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.319
Just lift the chair up for you.

641
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:37.862
- That feel okay?
- That's fine.

642
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.989
<i>For about 20 years.</i>

643
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:43.743
<i>I worked side by side with my father
at least one day a week.</i>

644
00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:47.914
<i>The timer has now failed
on the stage four.</i>

645
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.333
We want Thea wearing it 12 hours a day.

646
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.084
She forgot her appliance.

647
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:54.545
And it's quite apparent
she's only wearing it at night.

648
00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:57.632
We have two chairs
literally in the same room.

649
00:36:57.632 --> 00:37:00.760
<i>chatting with him about life.
the times. and everything.</i>

650
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.805
<i>And I just have nothing
but happy memories of that.</i>

651
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:07.183
<i>Then I took over
and it sort of became my clinic.</i>

652
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:10.603
<i>I literally thought
this would never go anywhere.</i>

653
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:13.606
<i>but I couldn't bear to do
conventional orthodontics</i>

654
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:17.818
<i>where I felt I was damaging
people's faces and health.</i>

655
00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:22.240
<i>Orthotropics is what I was born to do.</i>

656
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:42.051
Very good for you. yogurt.

657
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:45.137
Well. this is what everyone says--
Or what they were saying.

658
00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:47.640
And all of a sudden. apparently
yogurt is not good for you anymore.

659
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.227
and it's full of sugar.

660
00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:52.270
Yes. I...

661
00:37:54.981 --> 00:38:01.028
I swallow the description
that it's full of the right bacteria.

662
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:04.156
When you consider
the state of our knowledge.

663
00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:05.783
I think it's abysmal.

664
00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:08.035
How are we getting on with the omelet?

665
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:10.830
I'm wondering whether to have
some shredded wheat or not.

666
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.499
Well. I think--
I think we are almost omelet-ready.

667
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.837
There we go. sir.

668
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:20.006
- Fantastic.
- Your omelet.

669
00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:23.092
You're very good with omelets.

670
00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:26.887
Whenever I do them.
they're either too wet or too dry.

671
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:33.477
There's a very odd smell
coming from your fridge.

672
00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:37.815
Some milk has drained
into your smoked haddock. Dad.

673
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.904
You put cheese in it. didn't you?

674
00:38:43.904 --> 00:38:46.532
- I know.
- Which is lovely. but of course.

675
00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:48.492
it's become very stringy.

676
00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:55.666
<i>Dad's done all of this great stuff.
come up with all these great ideas.</i>

677
00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.878
<i>But no one knew about it.
And I knew in orthotropics</i>

678
00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:00.171
there was something interesting.

679
00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:03.841
Almost anyone I have a conversation with
is fascinated with this.

680
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:09.305
And yet here we have this really dry topic
that I couldn't get out there.

681
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:12.892
But my father's been trying
for 30. 40 years. if not more.

682
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:15.311
and he's not made-- got this idea out.

683
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:16.729
And now we've got social media.

684
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:22.693
And my bet here is that social media
is going to somehow give us wings.

685
00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:25.196
{\an8}If you can't breathe out of your nose.

686
00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:32.495
{\an8}you're forced to either die
or breathe out of your mouth.

687
00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:36.582
<i>We were just throwing things out there.</i>

688
00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:37.917
<i>throwing anything we could.</i>

689
00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:43.839
Did Brad Pitt have
a stronger jawline in the past?

690
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.091
This way.

691
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:48.260
<i>And it was really a scattergun approach</i>

692
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.639
<i>to see if we could get people interested
in what we were doing.</i>

693
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.101
I now have 14 sticks
of chewing gum in my mouth

694
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:56.394
all at one time.

695
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.938
{\an8}As this occurs. it narrows.

696
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:03.776
{\an8}and asymmetries automatically accumulate.

697
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:05.027
Is that comfortable. Tasha?

698
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:11.617
It was my objective
to get something to go viral.

699
00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:13.702
You just hold that eye contact.

700
00:40:13.702 --> 00:40:16.288
you know. with a cheeky smile
on your face.

701
00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:20.417
Eye contact with a cheeky smile.
that's magical for a girl.

702
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:25.214
<i>Someone saw one of my videos.
thought that was interesting.</i>

703
00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:27.466
<i>and I was just asked to give a lecture</i>

704
00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:33.139
<i>at a conference called the 21 Conference.
I think. something like that.</i>

705
00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:34.849
We're in good hands. Let's welcome Mike.

706
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.479
<i>It was the type of thing
that if I'd done proper research.</i>

707
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:41.689
<i>I'd have never done.</i>

708
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.275
I teach seduction for life.

709
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:47.945
I am so bored and sick of teaching people
how to walk up and stare at girls

710
00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.822
and stop them and go. "Hello."

711
00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:52.241
If you like women and you want to have
sex with women and date them--

712
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.742
Who likes girls?
Put your hands up real quick.

713
00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:55.077
all the people who like women. All right.

714
00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:57.830
Of course. a lot of them.
I showed how to have their first orgasm.

715
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.373
It was great. you know.

716
00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:01.167
They'll--they'll be
real thankful for that.

717
00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:03.461
What gives you a good face?

718
00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:10.551
I know that I look better now
than I did ten years ago.

719
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.555
Because I've made a concerted effort

720
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:16.724
to get my tongue on the roof
of my mouth...

721
00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:20.436
and chew more. a bit more chewing gum.

722
00:41:20.436 --> 00:41:21.604
That really is the thing.

723
00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:26.400
After that. we noticed
people talking about me

724
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.861
and talking about
these exercises I presented.

725
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:32.531
<i>If I could plug you in
like they do in</i> Matrix

726
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:35.159
<i>and upload a good tongue function pattern.</i>

727
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:38.996
<i>I think I could get you all
to grow fantastically.</i>

728
00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:44.126
<i>We were monitoring my name
on the internet.</i>

729
00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:46.837
<i>We then found a few alerts went out</i>

730
00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.924
<i>on a forum called SlutHate.</i>

731
00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:55.638
And it was this world of incels
that I really didn't know much about.

732
00:42:10.569 --> 00:42:13.948
<i>People were talking
about that lecture I'd given</i>

733
00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:17.952
<i>and what they could do
to improve themselves.</i>

734
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:21.622
<i>So I gave some responses.</i>

735
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:22.790
Hi.

736
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:27.378
Thank you for quite a lot of interest
from a number of forums.

737
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:32.466
in particular.
a forum I'm responding to here

738
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:35.844
called "SlutHate." as it happens.

739
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.935
The first response came
from IncelExecutioner.

740
00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:45.354
I do love some of the names
you've got here.

741
00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:50.025
BetaGayFace. you asked about face pulling.

742
00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:52.778
A question from Kushmaster.

743
00:42:52.778 --> 00:42:56.574
And then final one. um. Yul Brynner.

744
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.620
<i>Why did I engage with them.
and why did I respond to that?</i>

745
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.747
<i>I guess it's an instinctive thing</i>

746
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.541
<i>to get the information
out there to help people.</i>

747
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:07.960
<i>Most people go through
this period of time.</i>

748
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.336
<i>I went through this period of time</i>

749
00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:13.632
<i>when I was a young teenager
and I felt gawky and awkward</i>

750
00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:15.009
<i>and I couldn't chat a girl up.</i>

751
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.635
I couldn't-- you know.
it was quite difficult.

752
00:43:21.974 --> 00:43:25.811
I can understand this group of people

753
00:43:25.811 --> 00:43:29.440
gravitated to orthotropics
because. in essence.

754
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.734
<i>this was a sort of secret</i>

755
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:33.819
<i>that had never been divulged
to them before</i>

756
00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:36.739
<i>that was the answer
to all of their problems.</i>

757
00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:39.742
I'm literally turning--
yes. I'm turning the dweeb to a Chad.

758
00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.203
Yes. we engaged-- I engaged on SlutHate.

759
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.374
<i>which is one of those things.
again. if anyone asks you.</i>

760
00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:49.877
<i>never go and engage with people
on this sort of thing.</i>

761
00:43:49.877 --> 00:43:53.255
<i>But science isn't PC.</i>

762
00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:55.341
<i>Science is as you find it.</i>

763
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:57.718
But. you know. I'd have done a deal
with the devil to get this across.

764
00:43:57.718 --> 00:43:59.636
<i>We've been overwhelmed in response</i>

765
00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.430
<i>and interest from people.</i>

766
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.309
<i>It was just--it was a revelation to me.</i>

767
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.478
<i>It was really just nice.</i>

768
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.730
<i>It was nice to actually have an audience</i>

769
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.315
<i>who wanted to listen to you</i>

770
00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:14.526
<i>rather than the door being closed
at every opportunity.</i>

771
00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:20.240
<i>I didn't really cognitively think ahead
of what was happening.</i>

772
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.701
<i>But I could see this thing growing.</i>

773
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:27.122
<i>All of a sudden. it was like
Pandora's box had been opened.</i>

774
00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:33.337
That exercise is called mewing.

775
00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:36.840
and it's supposed to give you
more defined and sculpted jawline.

776
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.510
Here is an example
of a before and an after.

777
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.930
You can see that her jawline
is more defined.

778
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.974
All you have to do is place your tongue
on the roof of your mouth.

779
00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:47.559
and then you just close your lips.

780
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:49.186
<i>In this video.
I will be telling you</i>

781
00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:52.064
how long it takes to see results
from mewing.

782
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:53.440
<i>This is Joey.</i>

783
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.442
<i>He heard about a technique called mewing.</i>

784
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:57.528
<i>which is the proper posture of the tongue.</i>

785
00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:02.116
Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.

786
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:05.035
{\an8}In the long run. it's actually shown
to improve your face bone structure.

787
00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.830
<i>I was not expecting the mewing thing.</i>

788
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.124
{\an8}<i>That's not what I expected to happen.</i>

789
00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:14.753
{\an8}This really sort of academic. medical.

790
00:45:14.753 --> 00:45:18.340
{\an8}dry. difficult to understand
complex of orthotropics

791
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.008
{\an8}<i>that we'd struggled to get out there</i>

792
00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:22.344
{\an8}<i>suddenly became sexy.</i>

793
00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:26.265
{\an8}In yoga. just imagining.
like. the cat's back rounded.

794
00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.558
that's your tongue. like. rounded out.

795
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:28.600
Ah.

796
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.312
<i>I've been amazed
at what's been occurring recently.</i>

797
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:36.066
I'm wondering when my surname
became a verb.

798
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:39.653
M-E-W-I-N-G. mewing.

799
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:40.612
Mewing has changed my life.

800
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:43.240
What's up. guys? It's Tomazzo here.

801
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.952
{\an8}I look better. I'm healthier. I'm fitter.

802
00:45:46.952 --> 00:45:48.954
But having strong jaw muscles
is also important

803
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:51.123
because it makes your face
look much better.

804
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.541
<i>even for girls too.</i>

805
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.461
It kind of fixed everything.
It just didn't fix one or two things.

806
00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:58.088
It's revolutionary.
It's gonna transform the world.

807
00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.548
like. maybe. probably.

808
00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:05.762
If you want to develop a healthier face.

809
00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:09.475
if you want to fulfill
your genetic potential.

810
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:11.643
<i>identify it. work on it.</i>

811
00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.646
feel that posture a third of the time.

812
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:18.275
<i>I've got so many kids who are being forced
through orthodontics by their parents.</i>

813
00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.027
Mm.

814
00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:22.488
<i>All of a sudden. the idea of mewing</i>

815
00:46:22.488 --> 00:46:26.867
was just this antidote to all of that.

816
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:30.621
And also. it resonated with "good looks."

817
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:38.420
{\an8}Mewing is not cat.

818
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.130
{\an8}Mew. It's not cat.

819
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.549
{\an8}It's the correct tongue posture.

820
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:45.594
Tongue is up and flat.

821
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:48.222
On the soft palate like a trampoline.

822
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:49.556
- Hi.
- Hi. Excited to meet you.

823
00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:50.641
{\an8}- How are you?
- My name's Koko.

824
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.600
{\an8}I'm Kim.

825
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.768
{\an8}Thank you so much for coming.

826
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.269
- Scott.
- It's good to meet you. Koko.

827
00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:56.063
- Hi. how are you?
- Thank you.

828
00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:58.440
Have you done any face exercise

829
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.442
- or face yoga or anything like that?
- No.

830
00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:03.070
Mm.

831
00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:11.787
Mewing is a huge part of our method.
face yoga.

832
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:14.414
Mike Mew is like a legendary doctor

833

<i>in our community.</i>

834
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.501
He's like our god.

<i>If you want to get freaked out.</i>

836
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:22.172

837

{\an8}<i>Oh. gosh. it freaks me out.</i>

838
00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:26.552
{\an8}<i>Like. I mean. yes.
I've become a messiah to people.</i>

839
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:28.345
{\an8}You do have a very good jawline.

840
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.596
I tell you what.

841
00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:30.847
Yeah. you see?

842
00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.516
My goodness. me.

843
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.228
<i>And there came a point</i>

844
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:38.021
<i>when I actually thought to myself.</i>

845
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:42.359
<i>"Look. we've got the chance
of going around the system."</i>

846
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.320
<i>I believe Mike Mew.</i>

847
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.906
<i>- who I actually had on my podcast--</i>
- <i>Mewing.</i>

848
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.074
Yeah. mewing. exactly.

849
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:51.368
Mike Mew. I think has cracked the case.

850
00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.786
{\an8}That is crazy. Is that real?

851
00:47:52.786 --> 00:47:54.079
{\an8}- Yes.
- Yeah. yeah.

852
00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:56.373
{\an8}- She has like this little tiny ass jaw.
- That is real.

853
00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.916
{\an8}and then she developed a real normal one.

854
00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.293
{\an8}Yeah.

855
00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:00.752
{\an8}<i>Victor Hugo said.</i>

856
00:48:00.752 --> 00:48:05.716
"No army can stop an idea
whose time has come."

857
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.051
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle.

858
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.178
And I don't care
whether this came out of SlutHate.

859
00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:13.223
I don't care whether this came
through the British Orthodontic Society.

860
00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.977
It came. and it became popular.

861
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.187
And now we can be
on to the proper challenge

862
00:48:19.187 --> 00:48:21.940
of scientific engagement. the next step.

863
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:31.658
{\an8}<i>For me. the ancestral movement
is this return</i>

864
00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:34.911
{\an8}to how our Paleolithic ancestors lived.

865
00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:37.205
moved. and ate. and just understanding

866
00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:39.833
<i>that the more we emulate how they sat</i>

867
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:41.835
<i>and squatted and kind of moved.</i>

868
00:48:41.835 --> 00:48:43.712
<i>the healthier we became.</i>

869
00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:45.631
And that's what
this whole symposium is about.

870
00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:46.923
It's the ancestral health movement.

871
00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:50.594
{\an8}Next movement is the crawl.
just like a baby would crawl

872
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:51.887
{\an8}except the knees don't touch.

873
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.181
<i>I've been on a personal journey</i>

874
00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:56.600
<i>in trying to reverse
what's happened to me.</i>

875
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.935
My journey was a little bit more invasive.

876
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:04.816
<i>It's called a transpalatal distractor.</i>

877
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:06.234
and it was surgically installed.

878
00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:08.987
And I turn that device every other day

879
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.656
to widen my upper arch.

880
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:14.910
<i>Doctor's goal is to make
my nasal cavity wider</i>

881
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.495
<i>so I can breathe at night.</i>

882
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:20.082
<i>Before this. I could not breathe
through my nose at all.</i>

883
00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:21.625
I didn't have any idea why.

884
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:25.045
I was just. like.
going into research wormholes. confused.

885
00:49:25.045 --> 00:49:28.715
I had no idea what was happening to me
until I discovered mewing.

886
00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:34.554
<i>So understanding craniofacial dystrophy.</i>

887
00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:36.973
<i>as Mike Mew calls it. helped me understand</i>

888
00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.934
<i>what happened to me.</i>

889
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:43.146
Incorporating his philosophy
is curing my sleep apnea.

890
00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:46.358
It's literally. like. saving my life.

891
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:49.736
<i>Personally. I find him to be like an idol.
like someone who's championing the truth</i>

892
00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:51.863
right now in the scientific world

893
00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:53.907
where it's really hard
to come up with new ideas.

894
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.370
All right. this is starting
to feel a bit like the Oscars.

895
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.206
We've got a superstar coming up right now.

896
00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:04.876
{\an8}none other than Dr. Mike Mew.
He's an orthodontist from London

897
00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:09.172
{\an8}and an expert in oral posture
and rehabilitation.

898
00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:11.717
He's here to discuss how the way in which

899
00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:15.804
we hold our mouths
affects how our faces will grow.

900
00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:18.140
how we'll breathe. and more.

901
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.893
<i>What I'm trying to do is I'm trying
to start pulling everyone together</i>

902
00:50:21.893 --> 00:50:26.815
to make this movement.
And I've never done that before.

903
00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:28.400
I don't quite know what to do.

904
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.737
This is the biggest disease you've all got
that you don't know about.

905
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:34.823
Because it's in your face.
It is your face.

906
00:50:34.823 --> 00:50:39.077
You know. you don't want to admit this.
It's uncomfortable to admit it.

907
00:50:39.077 --> 00:50:41.496
You're all affected. You're all deformed.

908
00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:45.250
<i>You know. we've never really had this.</i>

909
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.420
where a group of people come together.

910
00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:50.839
fomented on the internet.

911
00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:52.758
You know. we had
the Arab Spring where people--

912
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:54.760
the social media helped
get people together

913
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.304
as a cohesive group to gain change.

914
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.388
Um...

915
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:02.517
now I want to try and do
the same thing in medicine.

916
00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:05.896
<i>you know. by the people.
for the people type of thing.</i>

917
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.732
And what we really need is a revolution.

918
00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:12.152
Many of you here will be
affected by the problems I'm saying.

919
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:16.198
you know. forward head posture.
snoring. sleep apnea.

920
00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:21.411
<i>My father's focus on facial beauty</i>

921
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:24.539
<i>has definitely held
this whole science back.</i>

922
00:51:24.539 --> 00:51:28.376
<i>and there is no real way around that.</i>

923
00:51:28.376 --> 00:51:31.588
<i>He goes full on. full throttle to beauty.</i>

924
00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.925
<i>And I think that harms his message.</i>

925
00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:38.804
People seem to care so much
more about how they look

926
00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:39.930
than how healthy they are.

927
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.517
But if I can use that
to get people to be healthier.

928
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:45.352
then great. I'll do what I want.

929
00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:47.813
If your face didn't grow well.

930
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:51.733
you may be looking ugly.

931
00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:56.154
That is your fault. and that may well have

932
00:51:56.154 --> 00:51:58.240
significant health implications.

933
00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.407
You know?

934
00:51:59.407 --> 00:52:01.451
I'm saying don't be happy
with where you are.

935
00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:04.704
Get off your ass and change.

936
00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:08.208
And. Mike. how about
for craniofacial dystrophy.

937
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.459
what can we do right now?

938
00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.711
What can everyone
in this room do right now

939
00:52:11.711 --> 00:52:12.838
to help reverse this?

940
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:15.340
Stand up straight and shut your mouth.

941
00:52:16.424 --> 00:52:19.052
<i>Speaking of chewing.
it's lunchtime. everybody.</i>

942
00:52:19.052 --> 00:52:24.474
<i>So thank you very much for coming.
Thank you to the entire panel.</i>

943
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:47.163
<i>Michael gets upset with me
because I talk a lot</i>

944
00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:50.458
<i>about facial appearance
and attractiveness.</i>

945
00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:53.628
<i>He says that that is counterproductive</i>

946
00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:57.090
<i>to the idea of promoting orthotropics.</i>

947
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.884
<i>I say nonsense.</i>

948
00:52:58.884 --> 00:53:03.013
<i>Anybody can make themselves
really good-looking</i>

949
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:07.392
<i>if they try. well.
certainly by the age of ten.</i>

950
00:53:11.229 --> 00:53:13.273
<i>As a five-year-old.</i>

951
00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:15.317
<i>I had a beautifully shaped face.</i>

952
00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:18.737
<i>Lovely. round. a bit square.
Very attractive.</i>

953
00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:21.448
But at the age of nine.

954
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:24.075
I started to leave my mouth open.

955
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:29.664
And the whole shape of my face
changed really quite dramatically.

956
00:53:29.664 --> 00:53:34.920
And I can remember going from being
a square-faced boy to a long-faced boy.

957
00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:41.551
I do remember one girl
I rather fancied saying.

958
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:45.221
"You know. the boy with the long face."
referring to me.

959
00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:48.016
So yes. people did notice.

960
00:53:48.016 --> 00:53:51.144
But I've always been
a fairly lively individual.

961
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:55.357
Therefore. I don't think
that it handicapped me that much.

962
00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:58.485
But it did mean
I didn't get the pretty girls.

963
00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:06.618
<i>Your face is your fortune.
without the slightest doubt.</i>

964
00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:11.623
<i>Good-looking people
have all the advantages.</i>

965
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:15.627
{\an8}This was a drawing

966
00:54:15.627 --> 00:54:19.297
{\an8}that I asked a professional artist

967
00:54:19.297 --> 00:54:25.470
{\an8}to make for me to represent
what I thought was a truly beautiful face.

968
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.223
I sent it back to the painter.

969
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:31.393
I would think. ten times. saying.

970
00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.603
"Please alter this. please alter that."

971
00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:36.314
{\an8}And I'm still not really happy with it.

972
00:54:36.314 --> 00:54:39.109
I really believe that in our mind.

973
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:42.821
imprinted in our subconscious.

974
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:45.073
we know exactly

975
00:54:45.073 --> 00:54:47.325
what the perfect face looks like.

976
00:54:47.325 --> 00:54:51.371
<i>And we know within one or two millimeters.</i>

977
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:54.124
<i>And we actually measure that.</i>

978
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.292
We have an instrument

979
00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:59.671
which we call an indicator ruler.

980
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:01.131
Very simple.

981
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:04.801
And you put this bit there
under your teeth like that.

982
00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:08.763
And then you touch your nose.

983
00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.599
I would say this part of my face

984
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:14.936
is probably that much too far back.

985
00:55:14.936 --> 00:55:16.813
Twenty. twenty-five millimeters.

986
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:19.024
That's a huge measurement.

987
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:22.110
- These 20 millimeters...
- Yes.

988
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.112
What difference
have they made in your life?

989
00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:27.407
Um. I-- I would have been good-looking.

990
00:55:41.629 --> 00:55:45.133
{\an8}<i>Don't underestimate
the long-term effects</i>

991
00:55:45.133 --> 00:55:46.968
{\an8}<i>of gaining habits.</i>

992
00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:51.222
{\an8}And it's very difficult
to enthuse children--

993
00:55:51.222 --> 00:55:54.976
Elbows off the table. Jessica.
Elbows off. Elbows off.

994
00:55:54.976 --> 00:55:55.935
Good girl.

995
00:55:57.062 --> 00:56:01.858
Enthuse children at an older age
to change deeply ingrained habits.

996
00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:05.153
And a habit learned at this age

997
00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:08.865
can become a lifetime's change.

998
00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:11.034
Elbows off the table.

999
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.829
There. There we go. Lips together.

1000
00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:17.290
<i>Michael is a little bit--</i>

1001
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.542
{\an8}he's a little bit strange.

1002
00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:22.003
{\an8}And we're all strange in some ways.

1003
00:56:22.003 --> 00:56:26.174
{\an8}But. um. I do take him as he is.

1004
00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:28.676
And I'm fine with it. you know?

1005
00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:30.637
Yeah. it's perfect. Milla.

1006
00:56:30.637 --> 00:56:33.640
I couldn't have met someone
more perfect than you.

1007
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.891
- you know. honestly.
- No way.

1008
00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.643
- Yeah. no. honestly.
- No one better than me?

1009
00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:38.103
<i>No. no. no. no. you're right.</i>

1010
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:44.776
He said to me straightaway. um.
"You have nice teeth."

1011
00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:49.697
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

1012
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.407
Yeah. it's a good line.

1013
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:53.535
Mm.

1014
00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:55.120
Oh. you're both chewing.

1015
00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:59.124
- Yeah. For later.
- You're a gum-chewing family.

1016
00:56:59.124 --> 00:57:00.583
- Yes. we try and force it
- Yeah.

1017
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.709
on the kids. as well.

1018
00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.505
Okay. here's a gravy.

1019
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:07.340
Don't lean on the table. just serve it.

1020
00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:12.053
Daddy. today I had
a chocolate pudding for lunch.

1021
00:57:12.053 --> 00:57:15.223
You had a chocolate pancake
for pudding for lunch today?

1022
00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:16.766
- Dear me.
- Chocolate inside.

1023
00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:19.060
- Lucky girl. eh?
- Lucky girl.

1024
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.521
Yeah. what is that school feeding you. eh?

1025
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:23.898
- No. not school.
- No. it's Mummy. actually.

1026
00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:25.859
- It was Mummy. was it?
- It's the lunch box. yeah.

1027
00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:27.193
Oh. yeah. right. the lunch box.

1028
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:38.830
- Lips closed.
- Don't speak with your mouth full.

1029
00:57:40.206 --> 00:57:41.457
Lips together. Zarina.

1030
00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:44.836
Lips together. I can see the kale
sticking out your mouth.

1031
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:56.598
<i>Personal vlog. September the 25th. 2018.</i>

1032
00:57:57.932 --> 00:58:01.436
{\an8}I have been expelled
from the British Orthodontic Society.

1033
00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:05.648
{\an8}The decision was unanimous.

1034
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:09.360
And to quote
a paragraph from the decision.

1035
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.280
"Having listened to what you had to say

1036
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.658
and having considered the matter in full.

1037
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:20.580
the unanimous decision of the board
is that. in our opinion.

1038
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.167
your conduct is contrary
to the interests of the society."

1039
00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:28.421
Now. they all went on to say

1040
00:58:28.421 --> 00:58:30.215
that they felt the social media campaign

1041
00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:35.595
that I've run seems to demonstrate
an unhealthy obsession with publicity

1042
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.513
to the detriment of patients.

1043
00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:41.184
Um. now. I don't want to be taken
into a dark corner

1044
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.353
and mugged quietly.

1045
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:54.447
<i>What I would really like to do
is just get someone to engage in debate.</i>

1046
00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:55.865
<i>So I want to go along</i>

1047
00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:58.952
to the British Orthodontic
Society Conference.

1048
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:01.621
It's the big conference of orthodontics.

1049
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:06.793
<i>If I had to give you</i>

1050
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:09.504
<i>one word about how I feel just now
about being at conference again</i>

1051
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:11.464
<i>in Manchester and seeing everybody.</i>

1052
00:59:11.464 --> 00:59:14.050
I think that it's summed up
in the word "giddy."

1053
00:59:19.597 --> 00:59:22.600
<i>I think one of the biggest problems</i>

1054
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.479
<i>is that lots and lots of patients</i>

1055
00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:29.607
who have heard about me
or seen my videos online

1056
00:59:29.607 --> 00:59:31.442
are asking difficult questions

1057
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.569
the orthodontists can't answer.

1058
00:59:34.946 --> 00:59:36.864
<i>The closer we get to Manchester.</i>

1059
00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:39.492
<i>the closer we get
to the British Orthodontic Society.</i>

1060
00:59:39.492 --> 00:59:42.912
<i>the more scared I get.</i>

1061
00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.414
You know. there's no other word.

1062
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:47.083
You know. it's just--

1063
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:49.252
It's really hard to do this.

1064
00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.878
It's really. really hard.

1065
01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:08.771
You know. I've never had
a full scientific discussion

1066
01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:11.274
or engagement with any orthodontist.

1067
01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.944
probably ever in my life. never.
You know. and I think that's a shame.

1068
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.406
<i>I would imagine that most people
at this conference</i>

1069
01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:21.868
<i>would describe me as a charlatan.</i>

1070
01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.244
<i>I think they probably think</i>

1071
01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:25.622
<i>I'm a bit stupid and a bit mad.</i>

1072
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:32.670
<i>I mean. just wake up.
You know. actually read a bloody paper.</i>

1073
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.714
<i>Actually ask yourself the question.</i>

1074
01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:38.676
<i>You did blindly follow the orthodontist
'cause they're your mates.</i>

1075
01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:41.512
<i>Yeah. actually do
what you were trained to do</i>

1076
01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:43.222
<i>and look at the basic evidence.</i>

1077
01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:45.516
<i>You know. you go into the lion's den.</i>

1078
01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:46.517
<i>That's where I'm going now.</i>

1079
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:09.248
I. un. I got a sense.
and by a sense. I mean a number of emails

1080
01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.334
from Nigel Harradine.

1081
01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.212
- Yeah.
- who was the head of the BSSO.

1082
01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.588
- Now the BOS.
- Yeah.

1083
01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:19.801
And he-- What came across
was a real Mew fatigue.

1084
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:22.387
{\an8}The vast body of orthodontists
in this country

1085
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:25.556
{\an8}who are well trained who go on courses

1086
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.517
{\an8}who read the literature and keep up.

1087
01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.353
<i>they're basing their practice
on the best available evidence.</i>

1088
01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.481
And some people just like to perhaps feel

1089
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.191
that they are slightly crying
in the wilderness.

1090
01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.901
He used a few terms.

1091
01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:40.029
<i>"The science falls
on their completely deaf ears."</i>

1092
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:43.032
<i>and. "They are an ancient fossil
with no adherents."</i>

1093
01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:46.035
<i>and. "Irrelevant noisy fringe."</i>

1094
01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.578
<i>and. "What they're selling is a scam."</i>

1095
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:48.538
<i>Right.</i>

1096
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.291
I totally agree with every word
you've just cited.

1097
01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:55.503
What I disagree with is that somebody
as important

1098
01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:59.173
as a former head of the British Society
for Orthodontics.

1099
01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:05.221
it's not enough to say.
"I'm sick of hearing Mewisms."

1100
01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.682
What he should be doing
is use the scientific method

1101
01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:10.143
and say why it's rubbish.

1102
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.270
Point out what's wrong with the Mews

1103
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.523
and how the Mews have the responsibility

1104
01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:20.069
to prove that what they're saying
has some merit. scientific merit.

1105
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:23.239
The Orthodontic Society is not doing it.

1106
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.950
And I suspect the reason
that they're not doing it

1107
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:29.537
is because some of the things
that orthodontists do

1108
01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:35.251
are equally culpable.
equally without foundation.

1109
01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:43.426
<i>One has to look back
at the last modern century</i>

1110
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.719
<i>of orthodontic practice</i>

1111
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.388
<i>to fully understand the business.</i>

1112
01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:55.021
<i>Edward Angle probably
was one of the greatest tinkerers</i>

1113
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.774
{\an8}in all of health care history.

1114
01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.276
{\an8}He was almost like a Thomas Edison

1115
01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.320
{\an8}of orthodontia.

1116
01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:08.576
<i>And in that time. the late 1890's.</i>

1117
01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.496
<i>there was a Victorian concept</i>

1118
01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:15.708
<i>that man needed to achieve nature's ideal.</i>

1119
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:19.253
<i>And Angle was a subscriber
to this point of view.</i>

1120
01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:22.423
<i>He looked at how teeth come together.</i>

1121
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.592
<i>which is called occlusion.</i>

1122
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:27.803
and he came up
with a classification system

1123
01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:31.766
of what he believed
was nature's intended ideal.

1124
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.728
<i>Edward Angle was the first one</i>

1125
01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:39.023
<i>to start a school of orthodontics.</i>

1126
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:42.860
and thereby. he had a monopoly
of orthodontic education.

1127
01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.657
<i>He had this ancient skull.</i>

1128
01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.618
<i>which had 32 teeth in perfect alignment.</i>

1129
01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:56.165
And that became--
by dictum. by Angle's rule.

1130
01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.625
this is the aim of treatment.

1131
01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:02.171
If God didn't want you to have 32 teeth.
he would have given you 28. right?

1132
01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:10.096
From that point forward.
that became the gold standard

1133
01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.057
that you were supposed to achieve
at the end of treatment.

1134
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.852
<i>And he concentrated.</i>

1135
01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.771
<i>over the course of his lifetime.</i>

1136
01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:22.358
the best way to move those teeth.

1137
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.406
<i>With each step towards facility.</i>

1138
01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:31.325
<i>more people jumped on the bandwagon.</i>

1139
01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.914
<i>Angle defined it as a standard of beauty</i>

1140
01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:38.499
<i>because it was ideal.</i>

1141
01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:43.588
{\an8}<i>Ideal and normal and beauty
all became conflated</i>

1142
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:47.508
in one concept. the orthodontic ideal.

1143
01:04:48.342 --> 01:04:50.636
<i>And therefore. come to me.</i>

1144
01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:52.638
<i>your lovely. friendly orthodontist.</i>

1145
01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.056
<i>and I'll make you look normal</i>

1146
01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:56.434
by arranging your 32 teeth

1147
01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:59.520
exactly the same way as his and hers

1148
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.439
and hers and his and then the other.

1149
01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:02.899
Everybody should look the same.

1150
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.735
That's the goal of orthodontics.

1151
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.863
I mean. just because you have
a Korean child here

1152
01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.991
and a Spanish child there.
to hell with it.

1153
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.870
Just do everybody the same.
'cause everybody wants to look the same.

1154
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.663
Everybody wants to look good.

1155
01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:21.626
<i>Everybody wants to look
like an American model or a film star.</i>

1156
01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:23.878
Is there anything wrong with that?

1157
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:30.926
{\an8}<i>The British Orthodontic Society
is just a club.</i>

1158
01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.637
{\an8}<i>You don't need to be a member</i>

1159
01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:34.013
{\an8}<i>of the British Orthodontic Society.</i>

1160
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:40.519
<i>Now. the problem with this is that
they had already</i>

1161
01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:41.854
<i>referred me to the General Dental Council.</i>

1162
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.817
<i>The General Dental Council
holds my license to practice.</i>

1163
01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:51.322
So. we will have a hearing
at the General Dental Council in November.

1164
01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:55.201
And in November. they're going to decide
whether or not to take my license away.

1165
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:58.162
<i>So. I tried to engage some people
in conversation.</i>

1166
01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:01.207
<i>and it is literally.
"No. I don't want to talk to you."</i>

1167
01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.710
<i>You know. it's really quite oppressive
for you to be in a place</i>

1168
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:07.713
<i>where 50% of the people are blanking you.</i>

1169
01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.549
<i>And you know--you know.
you can see people touching</i>

1170
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:13.094
<i>and talking about you
and pointing you out.</i>

1171
01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.637
<i>You know. this whole thing.
what I'm doing.</i>

1172
01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:19.433
<i>it really takes courage to do this.</i>

1173
01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:21.185
You know. I'm impressed with my father.

1174
01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:23.312
He's got thicker skin than I've got.

1175
01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:27.733
Maybe he didn't at my age and he grew.

1176
01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.571
I'm slightly concerned

1177
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:37.201
that this is going to be a story about you

1178
01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:40.079
rather than about orthotropics.

1179
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:44.959
I don't--I don't think you want that.
but I think they're gonna make it that.

1180
01:06:57.638 --> 01:06:58.556
Hi. Mike.

1181
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.736
So the GDC now know

1182
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.987
- you've taken the case.
- They do.

1183
01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:14.780
- So they've been informed of that. Okay.
- Yes. they've been informed.

1184
01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.866
- So they're waiting on you.
- They know that there'll be a time lag.

1185
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.325
- obviously. for us to catch up.
- Yes. Yeah.

1186
01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:22.371
{\an8}I've been going
through the very interesting statement

1187
01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.415
{\an8}- of Stephen Powell.
- Mm.

1188
01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:25.458
{\an8}Now. you know that's...

1189
01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.209
- nearly 200 pages long.
- Good bedtime reading.

1190
01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.836
Yeah. Nearly 200 pages long

1191
01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:31.464
- with about 200 pages of appendices.
- Mm.

1192
01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.799
I'm working my way through that slowly.

1193
01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:38.888
But the accusation is fundamental.

1194
01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.014
It's root and branch.

1195
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.057
- They say what you're saying
- Yeah.

1196
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.558
- is total nonsense.
- A total nonsense. yes.

1197
01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.351
In essence. he's calling you a charlatan.

1198
01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:46.812
- Mm. One of us is a charlatan.
- But--

1199
01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:47.772
Okay.

1200
01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:51.358
Well. the trial. I think.
in the next few months

1201
01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:53.569
- is going to work out which one.
- Yes.

1202
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.614
<i>The allegations against him
are quite lengthy.</i>

1203
01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.991
<i>So. I'll just give you a flavor
of what they are.</i>

1204
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.243
<i>Basically. what the GDC is saying</i>

1205
01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.120
<i>or what the prosecution is saying</i>

1206
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:08.709
is that he was making claims
about his procedures

1207
01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:11.087
which have no scientific basis.

1208
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:15.049
so saying. "We can do X and Y."

1209
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:19.678
In fact. he knew
that he could not achieve X and Y.

1210
01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:21.180
A second part of it

1211
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:25.643
is that he was advocating
the need for treatment

1212
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.394
where they are saying

1213
01:08:27.394 --> 01:08:29.313
actually there was no need
for treatment at all.

1214
01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:31.482
In terms of the expert evidence
against him.

1215
01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:35.820
they are saying that the whole thing
is basically snake oil.

1216
01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:41.200
<i>Undoubtedly. orthotropics is on trial.</i>

1217
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.954
<i>I mean. I'm concerned for Michael.
I'm his father.</i>

1218
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:48.374
<i>But I've been through
the same battle myself.</i>

1219
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.376
and I know that Michael

1220
01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.670
- will not get a fair trial.
- I can--

1221
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.338
What do you think about the new barrister?

1222
01:08:54.338 --> 01:08:57.133
He has asked for all the cash up front.

1223
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.677
Now. that's very unusual with a barrister.

1224
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:03.681
Not--not top barristers in London.

1225
01:09:03.681 --> 01:09:05.808
Well. I've not come across it yet.

1226
01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.811
Yeah. 'cause you've not been playing
in that game yet.

1227
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.855
- Oh. I don't think you're right.
- Oh. maybe.

1228
01:09:10.855 --> 01:09:11.939
On one occasion.

1229
01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.483
- I took the minister of health to court.
- To the high court.

1230
01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.528
- Yes. you did. didn't you?
- I did not get much higher than that.

1231
01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.446
My case is different.

1232
01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:24.326
So tactically. as we start up
till my court case.

1233
01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:29.456
could maybe not be too critical
of the whole orthodontic profession.

1234
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:34.086
Yes. I mean.
when talking to orthodontists.

1235
01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.046
I'm always very polite.

1236
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:41.260
The ideal way and the way we've agreed...

1237
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.722
- Right.
- We're trying not to be

1238
01:09:45.556 --> 01:09:49.560
too immediately insulting
about fixed braces.

1239
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.396
Um. you are. I'm not.

1240
01:09:52.396 --> 01:09:54.398
You won't separate me on that.

1241
01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:58.110
Fixed braces should never be used.

1242
01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:02.197
They damage the teeth.
the roots. and the face.

1243
01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:04.575
Then say fixed appliances
can damage faces.

1244
01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.702
not that they always do it.

1245
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.163
No. Michael. I really can't.

1246
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.581
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1247
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.124
We won't agree on that.

1248
01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:16.378
- I am not good at changing people's minds.
- Yes.

1249
01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.340
- No.
- But I do speak the truth.

1250
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.718
If Michael is going soft on that.

1251
01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:26.055
it's because he doesn't want
to rock the boat too much.

1252
01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.389
but it's true.

1253
01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:32.728
Dad. you were a property developer.
That's how you made your money.

1254
01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.730
- Yes.
- You could-- Later in your career.

1255
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.106
you could afford to lose your license.

1256
01:10:36.106 --> 01:10:37.066
Yes.

1257
01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:40.361
You know. I've got a young--
I've got a young family.

1258
01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.322
You know. for me. I mean. I've--

1259
01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.407
I've sold my house for the proceeds.

1260
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.159
Now I've just taken the deposit

1261
01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:48.577
for buying another house

1262
01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.621
and blown that as well.

1263
01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:54.458
So this is everything.
I've put everything into it.

1264
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.002
This is everything of my life.

1265
01:10:57.002 --> 01:10:59.672
So. I think-- And also.

1266
01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.173
my father has already lost his license.

1267
01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:02.800
You know. we don't have a backup now.

1268
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.511
I'm plan B. Plan B's got to work.

1269
01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:15.521
<i>Obviously. he paid
quite a big money for that barrister.</i>

1270
01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.189
Michael said. "Do you think--

1271
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:23.112
can I pay that money to the lawyer
instead of buying a house?"

1272
01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:27.074
And I said. "Well. if you think
it's the right thing to do. you do it."

1273
01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:30.160
So. when you have family.

1274
01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.872
you know. it's what you do.

1275
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:43.590
<i>Hundred percent I'm sure
that he gonna win that case.</i>

1276
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:48.762
Otherwise. I would be very--
it will be--I will be just...

1277
01:11:48.762 --> 01:11:50.973
How should I say?

1278
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.017
I'm gonna invite the barrister for tea.

1279
01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:58.772
It's a familiar narrative
all the way through history.

1280
01:11:58.772 --> 01:12:00.316
David and Goliath.

1281
01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.860
big corporations. the small guy.

1282
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.320
the whistleblower.

1283
01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:11.410
<i>He has. I think.
the understandable difficulty</i>

1284
01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.537
<i>that he's very emotionally invested.</i>

1285
01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.582
<i>This is now two generations of individuals</i>

1286
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:21.295
that are protecting a theory
and a way of treatment.

1287
01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:22.963
whether that lives or dies.

1288
01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:29.261
<i>I-- My life is layers and layers
and layers of stress at the moment.</i>

1289
01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:32.723
<i>It's worries about my career.</i>

1290
01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.892
<i>how that-- If I lose my license.</i>

1291
01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:37.478
<i>you know. how I will let
all my patients down.</i>

1292
01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:40.814
<i>You know. I'm worried about
moving the science I'm doing forwards.</i>

1293
01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:43.650
<i>You know. because I know
what I can achieve.</i>

1294
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:46.820
<i>And I know that I'm not getting
the halfway there</i>

1295
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.989
<i>with my patients at the moment.</i>

1296
01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:54.078
What's been happening
since I saw you last time?

1297
01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.037
Not much.

1298
01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:56.747
Okay.

1299
01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:57.956
When you mean not much.

1300
01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.500
what do you mean by not much?

1301
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.337
Uh. I mean nothing really major
or noticeable--

1302
01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:05.964
or noticeable
other than traveling happened.

1303
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:10.094
All right. have you been wearing
your Myobrace much?

1304
01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.553
Uh. no.

1305
01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.222
What about the chewing gum?

1306
01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.432
I did a bit on some airplanes.

1307
01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:18.685
Have you been working on trying
to improve your posture?

1308
01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:19.728
A little bit.

1309
01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.355
But you've not really done anything?

1310
01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.065
- No.
- Okay.

1311
01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.527
Wider. Close a little bit.

1312
01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:31.990
You gave me the distinct impression

1313
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.076
that you didn't want
to do any more treatment

1314
01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.369
the last time I talked to you.

1315
01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.662
I have no recollection

1316
01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:37.704
- of the last conversation.
- Yeah.

1317
01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:38.664
Well. I make notes.

1318
01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:41.875
<i>Orthotropics is completely--</i>

1319
01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:45.838
<i>it's completely compliance-dependent.</i>

1320
01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:49.133
<i>And I'm treating most people
who have no real idea of the benefit</i>

1321
01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.384
<i>they're gonna gain from this.</i>

1322
01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.761
<i>They don't realize that this is probably</i>

1323
01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:58.058
<i>one of the most important things
they're ever. ever going to do.</i>

1324
01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:00.477
<i>And they can't be bothered
to wear the brace in the afternoons.</i>

1325
01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:05.732
Adam. if you could commit
to chewing gum...

1326
01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.278
It's hard to find a steady supply
of certain gum

1327
01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.404
- No. no--
- at the moment.

1328
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.489
- Just a minute. I will--
- Say what really you've been--

1329
01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:14.366
Don't worry about the logistics. Adam.

1330
01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:15.325
Okay.

1331
01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:17.744
Think about what would be
the desired outcome.

1332
01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:18.704
All right.

1333
01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:22.082
Thank you. sir.

1334
01:14:22.082 --> 01:14:23.709
Work hard.

1335
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:24.710
Get back in the Myobrace.

1336
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.211
- Let's talk in two weeks' time.
- Okay.

1337
01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.046
All right? Okay. Thank you very much.

1338
01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:29.173
For once. I found someone

1339
01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:32.050
that doesn't squeeze my hand too hard.

1340
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:33.385
That wasn't too hard. was it?

1341
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.678
No. he's saying that it's the first time--

1342
01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:36.180
For once I found someone.

1343
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.681
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1344
01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:38.765
So thank you.

1345
01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:40.100
- Take care.
- Bye.

1346
01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:52.613
<i>I have no musical training.
no musical background.</i>

1347
01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:56.074
<i>no ability to sing.</i>

1348
01:14:56.074 --> 01:14:58.285
<i>I picked up my child's ukulele.</i>

1349
01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:01.413
<i>and suddenly. music started
to flow into me.</i>

1350
01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:06.293
And I wrote this song called "The Lies."

1351
01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:08.253
<i>It's seven minutes long.</i>

1352
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:36.406
<i>â™ª Water isn't H20 â™ª</i>

1353
01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:42.162
<i>â™ª It's a story you've been told â™ª</i>

1354
01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:48.252
<i>â™ª What is truth and how do you know â™ª</i>

1355
01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:52.631
<i>â™ª Who's telling those lies â™ª</i>

1356
01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:58.136
<i>â™ª History. history â™ª</i>

1357
01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:03.267
<i>â™ª It's a trickster's symphony â™ª</i>

1358
01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:08.438
<i>â™ª Rockefeller. medicine
And orthodontics too â™ª</i>

1359
01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:13.360
<i>â™ª Carefully designed
To keep disease in you â™ª</i>

1360
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.991
<i>â™ª If you won't see
When you're being fooled â™ª</i>

1361
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:24.329
<i>â™ª Parasites over you will rule â™ª</i>

1362
01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:29.668
<i>â™ª Ooh. the lies we've been sold â™ª</i>

1363
01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:35.590
<i>â™ª Re-examine everything you're told â™ª</i>

1364
01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.769
Whoa. this trial. I mean. you know--

1365
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.314
You know. I should be
clinically depressed.

1366
01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.232
Whoa. whoa. Over the top.

1367
01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:54.026
The reason I'm not
is 'cause I'm on a mission.

1368
01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.611
We're now two months away.

1369
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.571
And I'm agitated-- I go to bed agitated.

1370
01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.615
I wake up in the middle
of the night agitated.

1371
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.950
And I've got so much to do
that I haven't done yet.

1372
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.785
you know. just mountains of work.

1373
01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.537
{\an8}Let's break up tasks.
Then I can sit and get on.

1374
01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:06.955
{\an8}Yeah. so that's the one thing.

1375
01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.874
{\an8}Because I'll need some quiet time
for me to get on with.

1376
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.126
{\an8}<i>I would have liked to be
so much further ahead.</i>

1377
01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.795
<i>I would have liked to have
so much more media engagement.</i>

1378
01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.964
<i>I've gotta increase the web presence
as much as possible.</i>

1379
01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:19.760
<i>And I'm just so behind
where I wanted to be.</i>

1380
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.429
<i>You know. having to phone Dianne up
and plan the video we're gonna do.</i>

1381
01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.307
And it--it's really hard.

1382
01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:28.268
How's about. shall go see
if I can watch those two videos?

1383
01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:29.394
Yes.

1384
01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:30.687
That might be the best thing.

1385
01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:32.397
Okay. let me watch.

1386
01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:34.274
- Before tomorrow--
- I would have joined in

1387
01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:35.692
if I'd known there was a discussion.

1388
01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:37.444
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes.

1389
01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:40.238
Lots of points I would
have liked to have made.

1390
01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:41.615
But there's always a discussion.

1391
01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.492
- Always a discussion.
- Nobody tells me anything.

1392
01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.327
<i>You've got the family you have</i>

1393
01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.037
and then the family you choose.

1394
01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:50.624
And we kind of chose the Mews.
And I think that's mutual.

1395
01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:52.834
So yeah. that's a good feeling.

1396
01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:55.128
{\an8}I want a real glamour shot. yeah.

1397
01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.381
{\an8}Yeah. I'd like to have
a real glamour shot

1398
01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.007
{\an8}of the two of you.
and Bill in the background.

1399
01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:00.133
{\an8}- I'll lean forward.
- How's my jaw?

1400
01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:01.343
- Then it will be bigger.
- Yeah.

1401
01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.053
<i>We live in Broek in Waterland.</i>

1402
01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.722
<i>which is a very small town near Amsterdam.</i>

1403
01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:07.349
And I've got this receded chin.

1404
01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.809
And I always thought. "Well. you know.

1405
01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.727
that's just genetics
you don't know about."

1406
01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:14.231
But I think it was somewhere on Facebook
that somebody posted something like.

1407
01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:17.484
"You have to see this video
because it will change your life forever."

1408
01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.819
I was like. "Yeah. right."

1409
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.071
But that was a video by Mike

1410
01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.615
<i>doing the 21st Century Man convention.</i>

1411
01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.576
<i>And he was talking about all these things.
And then everything clicked.</i>

1412
01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:28.412
It's like. "Oh. I've got this.
I've got this.

1413
01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:29.871
I've got this. I've got this."

1414
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:33.291
<i>And then one day. he asked for people</i>

1415
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.627
<i>to come help with his YouTube channel.</i>

1416
01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:38.171
<i>And I thought.
"Why don't just drop this man</i>

1417
01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:40.424
<i>a letter or email?"</i>

1418
01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:43.969
He said. "Yeah. well. I'm in a castle
next weekend with my family.

1419
01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.429
Do you want to come over?"

1420
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:49.766
And we're like. "That's kind of weird.
but just let's-- let's go."

1421
01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:51.476
Let's-- You know. I've got twin boys.

1422
01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:55.313
Let's just go to England
and meet this YouTube guy

1423
01:18:55.313 --> 01:18:56.481
and see if we can help.

1424
01:19:00.485 --> 01:19:03.363
<i>We were coming down here.
and we saw the castle.</i>

1425
01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.449
<i>and it just felt unreal.</i>

1426
01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:16.293
<i>It felt like we were welcomed
in some kind of Italian family.</i>

1427
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.795
<i>And it clicked. just clicked.</i>

1428
01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:26.720
<i>I do think Mike
changes life for some. as he did mine.</i>

1429
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.932
<i>To some of the Mews.
he's like the new god and messiah.</i>

1430
01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.727
Well. maybe he is. Who knows?

1431
01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:38.190
For him. he's just
trying to do his best. like Jesus was.

1432
01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:41.359
We're gonna talk about--
the video we're gonna do now.

1433
01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:42.861
- Oh. yeah. let's go upstairs.
- Okay?

1434
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:45.530
Wait. wait. just a little bit of planning.
So we're gonna go upstairs

1435
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.699
and we're gonna start
by saying that we need

1436
01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:50.535
more nuance to the idea of beauty.

1437
01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.790
Don't respond just yet.
Just wait until we're upstairs.

1438
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.292
- I can do that. all right.
- Okay.

1439
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.960
We should do.

1440
01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:02.422
No. no. no. That's just the way it is.

1441
01:20:02.422 --> 01:20:03.465
We're YouTubers.

1442
01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:08.678
I'm just trying to quickly

1443
01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:11.681
put together
a PowerPoint presentation as we speak.

1444
01:20:11.681 --> 01:20:14.434
- It sounds a bit late for all that.
- Well. yeah--

1445
01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:16.436
Don't we just want to chat?

1446
01:20:16.436 --> 01:20:18.855
Okay. we're ready to go.

1447
01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:27.239
Hi. and welcome.

1448
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.532
I'm sitting with my father.

1449
01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.158
{\an8}and today we're gonna talk about

1450
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:34.996
{\an8}some more nuances to facial attractiveness
than just a square face.

1451
01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:38.041
So. Dad. I've got an image here.

1452
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:42.254
These people had physically
better facial form

1453
01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:43.839
<i>from a health perspective.</i>

1454
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.049
<i>I look at those faces.</i>

1455
01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:48.176
<i>and they don't terribly appeal to me.</i>

1456
01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:51.471
<i>I'm always attracted
to dimples in the cheeks</i>

1457
01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:53.306
<i>and there are very few there.</i>

1458
01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:55.225
Remember-- Sorry--

1459
01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.434
Remember to look at the camera.

1460
01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:59.020
Well. I'm talking to the interviewer.

1461
01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.439
If I have to talk about anything.

1462
01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:04.317
I find it very difficult
to be directed on this.

1463
01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:05.569
So we need to be--

1464
01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:07.779
And I can see all sorts
of difficulties already.

1465
01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:09.656
But that's what we want to discuss.

1466
01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:11.366
Yes. I've got very specific ideas.

1467
01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.951
- Fine. first of all. we--
- Absolutely.

1468
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.203
First of all-- Wait.

1469
01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.413
<i>This is Rubens.</i>

1470
01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.664
<i>Many times.</i>

1471
01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:19.165
<i>Many times. it's not a new one.</i>

1472
01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:20.667
- Yes. No.
- At the time.

1473
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.127
this is what was considered attractive.

1474
01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.087
<i>That time. there's no doubt</i>

1475
01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:26.256
that fat people were considered.

1476
01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:30.760
shall I say. more attractive.
more appealing.

1477
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.054
I think. would perhaps a better word.

1478
01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.431
<i>And then. of course. we've moved on</i>

1479
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.975
<i>to this era of these
incredibly thin models.</i>

1480
01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:39.644
<i>Yes. I have always preferred</i>

1481
01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:44.566
the 38". 22". 36" shape myself.

1482
01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:48.320
And I actually think that's probably
a little bit more natural.

1483
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:52.282
And looking at our ancestors
of 20.000 years ago.

1484
01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.826
they hardly had any such mouths.

1485
01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:56.870
Now they're relatively common.

1486
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.538
I've not seen research on that.

1487
01:21:58.538 --> 01:22:02.417
No. No. nor have I.

1488
01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.836
So you've just--

1489
01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:08.465
Remember. I am someone
who is a lateral thinker.

1490
01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:09.758
Yeah. yeah. I--

1491
01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.718
And I have very little science.

1492
01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.803
- It's mostly logic.
- But--but--

1493
01:22:13.803 --> 01:22:17.515
I mean. my biggest problem
often is my father.

1494
01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:21.353
I'm certain that. to some extent.

1495
01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:24.147
my father stands in the way
of his own legacy

1496
01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:27.192
by being so pigheaded and obstinate.

1497
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.443
- All right.
- Thank you for watching.

1498
01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:29.986
Thank you very much for watching.

1499
01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:31.780
- I'll see you next time.
- See you next time.

1500
01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.699
Thank you very much for watching.
See you next time.

1501
01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:36.534
Uh. something--

1502
01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:38.703
Yeah. you need editing.
But that's. uh-- Yeah.

1503
01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:40.330
You know. well.
they say you should never work

1504
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:43.375
with animals and children or your father.

1505
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.423
Okay. let's just get
a little bit more around your ears here.

1506
01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:55.387
Try not to cut your
hearing aid off. though. eh?

1507
01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.189
There you go. Popsies.

1508
01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:08.400
- Beautiful.
- Right. thank you.

1509
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.527
Don't leave me over here.

1510
01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.904
Okay. hang on. I'm coming back.
I'm coming.

1511
01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:18.451
Well. unfortunately. the years count on.

1512
01:23:18.451 --> 01:23:22.706
And nowadays.
almost all my friends have died.

1513
01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:26.751
I must say that my friends
that died when they were young

1514
01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:29.337
had fantastic funerals.

1515
01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:33.091
But when I die. there's going--
Nobody's going to be there.

1516
01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:34.467
Don't worry about that. Dad. I--

1517
01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:35.927
I have--

1518
01:23:35.927 --> 01:23:38.847
- You'll make sure it's a good send-off.
- I'll make sure you get a good send-off.

1519
01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.975
Right. with lots of alcohol.

1520
01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:44.018
With lots of-- Yes. yes.
shame I don't drink anymore.

1521
01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:46.354
Yes. let's have a bloody good party.

1522
01:23:47.647 --> 01:23:50.608
- Mike. for your campaign website...
- Yes?

1523
01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:52.902
- When does it need to be live?
- Thursday.

1524
01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:54.654
What's happening on Thursday?

1525
01:23:54.654 --> 01:23:57.032
Thursday. I'm gonna dress up
as Martin Luther.

1526
01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.950
Are you? How wonderful.

1527
01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.870
So then I'm gonna go in.
I'm gonna hammer my ten principles

1528
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.580
to the door of the GDC.

1529
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.875
Can I just inquire. why--
why Martin Luther King?

1530
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.877
It's not Martin Luther King.
It's Martin Luther.

1531
01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.963
Martin Luther was
a Protestant who nailed--

1532
01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:15.800
Rosie. there's no--
there's no flame under this chorizo.

1533
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.886
Yes. I just turned it off
'cause I'm not quite ready.

1534
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.096
Okay. All right.

1535
01:24:20.096 --> 01:24:23.308
So he set out Protestant principles

1536
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.143
against the Catholic Church.

1537
01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.102
Right.

1538
01:24:26.102 --> 01:24:27.812
But he started
the Protestant church. basically.

1539
01:24:27.812 --> 01:24:29.647
And how do you dress as Martin Luther?

1540
01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:30.732
- I don't know.
- What does that--

1541
01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:31.733
what does a Protestant look like?

1542
01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.735
- Have you sorted out a costume?
- Have you got a costume?

1543
01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:34.736
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1544
01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.905
Remember. the Germans

1545
01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.324
wore different clothes than the English.

1546
01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.285
I'm not sure about the--

1547
01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:44.662
I'm not sure about
the historical accuracy.

1548
01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:46.998
<i>Are you very worried</i>

1549
01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:48.792
<i>that the orthodontic establishment</i>

1550
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.085
will have you up on inaccurate dress?

1551
01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.295
Yeah. I don't know.

1552
01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:55.173
I think damage to the door
might be top of their priority.

1553
01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.259
But you could just hammer--

1554
01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.220
How long has that asparagus been on?

1555
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.305
It's got one minute. 18 to go.

1556
01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:03.973
Mike. I do mean this.

1557
01:25:03.973 --> 01:25:07.435
You need to have
a proper document drawn up

1558
01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:12.774
with the capital letters
in gold trimmed with red.

1559
01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.068
Right. Did you get that. Mike?

1560
01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.027
- It's very important.
- Way beyond

1561
01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:18.404
my calligraphy skills. so yes.

1562
01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:21.032
it'll be one of those days
where it'll all work out on the day.

1563
01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:22.617
Let's not worry too much about it.

1564
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.042
<i>Dr. Mew is obviously
a real character.</i>

1565
01:25:31.042 --> 01:25:34.462
He's quite eccentric.
which I don't mind at all.

1566
01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:38.091
But we have to pull back
from being a bit crazy.

1567
01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:42.512
because there is a fine balance
between an eccentric professor type

1568
01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.305
and someone who's a bit crazy.

1569
01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.474
And to dress up as Martin Luther

1570
01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:50.061
would just be a sort of
a flippant thing to do.

1571
01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:55.191
And when you're going into
the GDC in a few months' time.

1572
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:57.152
you don't want to walk past
their front door

1573
01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:01.281
with the nail marks in it
from where you pinned your request.

1574
01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.241
It just doesn't--
I can't see how it helps.

1575
01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:05.368
So I just said to him
I thought it was crazy

1576
01:26:05.368 --> 01:26:06.953
and not to do it.

1577
01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:08.872
and I would expect him
to follow my advice.

1578
01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.569
I got my...

1579
01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:05.303
<i>Roughly a decade ago.
my father stood at this very spot</i>

1580
01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:06.721
<i>with a sandwich board</i>

1581
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:11.559
<i>trying to raise awareness
of basically the same issues.</i>

1582
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:16.022
<i>And. yeah. it didn't get anywhere.</i>

1583
01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:21.194
<i>And half of the reason I'm pushing so hard</i>

1584
01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:24.113
<i>is to gain him some recognition</i>

1585
01:27:24.113 --> 01:27:28.159
<i>while he's still capable
of appreciating it.</i>

1586
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.754
{\an8}So here's my statement
to the world. to the GDC.

1587
01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.965
"For too long. our concerns

1588
01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:45.635
have not been heard or debated.

1589
01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:48.096
My speciality was becoming

1590
01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.473
more of a religion than a science.

1591
01:27:50.473 --> 01:27:53.434
We want the truth. the whole truth.
and no dogma."

1592
01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:57.772
I've signed this Martin Luther Mew.

1593
01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.358
<i>And I was going to nail</i>

1594
01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:03.695
<i>one of these statements to the front door.</i>

1595
01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:08.324
<i>but I'm just cautious of imagery
that could be used to defame me.</i>

1596
01:28:08.324 --> 01:28:11.035
Now I've gotta play the game. you know?
I've got to win this.

1597
01:28:11.035 --> 01:28:13.538
I've got to win this for everyone.
I've gotta win this.

1598
01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:16.582
<i>I worry the slight pressure</i>

1599
01:28:16.582 --> 01:28:18.710
that Dad's putting on Mike.

1600
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:22.380
<i>not in a nasty way. but just.
"We're almost there.</i>

1601
01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.798
<i>we're almost there. we're almost there.</i>

1602
01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.633
If we just. if we just. if we just."

1603
01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:30.179
So it's like this
massive drive at the moment.

1604
01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:35.059
<i>I think Michael is almost more driven
or more focused than Dad.</i>

1605
01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:39.063
<i>Dad-- I mean. Dad has done everything</i>

1606
01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:41.190
<i>and been everywhere.</i>

1607
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:43.318
<i>If I was to die and be reincarnated</i>

1608
01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.487
as anyone in the world.
I would come back as Dad.

1609
01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.572
Sorry.

1610
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.032
'Cause he's done-- he's done--

1611
01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.909
- He has.
- I know you have. I know.

1612
01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:54.162
<i>But his life. not your life. his life.</i>

1613
01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.913
<i>- Michael. I worry about him</i>
- <i>I'd just be</i>

1614
01:28:55.913 --> 01:28:57.123
<i>- slightly because he is...
- an absolute--</i>

1615
01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.249
<i>There's no point.</i>

1616
01:28:58.249 --> 01:29:00.793
...totally insanely focused
on orthotropics

1617
01:29:00.793 --> 01:29:02.253
and has nothing outside of it.

1618
01:29:02.253 --> 01:29:03.755
- And I think part of it--
- Not nothing.

1619
01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:05.006
Not nothing. no. no. no. But you're--

1620
01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.049
Less than I should.

1621
01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.717
You're 80%.

1622
01:29:12.972 --> 01:29:15.850
- <i>I mean. he's lived it to the full.</i>
- You know. he was a racing car driver.

1623
01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.644
<i>He holds records at Brands Hatch.</i>

1624
01:29:18.644 --> 01:29:19.771
<i>He happened to be--</i>

1625
01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.522
<i>He says-- He's. like.
the oldest person ever</i>

1626
01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.857
<i>- to get their Yachtmasters.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1627
01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:24.817
<i>- He's. you know--
- Skiing history.</i>

1628
01:29:24.817 --> 01:29:26.277
<i>Jousting.</i>

1629
01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:29.697
On horseback with a large jousting lance.

1630
01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.782
Charging at someone else.

1631
01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.450
<i>Charging to--
somewhat out of control.</i>

1632
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.118
{\an8}<i>He doesn't ride horses.</i>

1633
01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:36.746
And then he said. "Okay.
we're gonna build a castle.

1634
01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:39.040
<i>Kids. we're gonna build
a castle on an island</i>

1635
01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.249
<i>in the middle of a lake."</i>

1636
01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:41.959
<i>And we all went. "Yeah. okay. Dad."</i>

1637
01:29:41.959 --> 01:29:44.170
<i>You know. all our friends
thought we were bonkers.</i>

1638
01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:46.798
- more so. more so than they did before.
- Yeah. yeah.

1639
01:29:48.966 --> 01:29:51.594
<i>But mind you. I sometimes
think him building the castle</i>

1640
01:29:51.594 --> 01:29:53.846
<i>was a little bit like Churchill's war.</i>

1641
01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:55.723
- You know. when--
- Therapeutic.

1642
01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.642
Therapeutic. yes.

1643
01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:59.727
It took his mind off--

1644
01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.229
the wilderness. yeah. well. he may as well

1645
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.688
- 'cause he has forever.
- Well. I know I think

1646
01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:05.274
<i>he thought that Biobloc and orthotropics</i>

1647
01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:06.818
<i>was going to hit in quicker.</i>

1648
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.820
<i>And he just got so frustrated.</i>

1649
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.364
He said. "I need
something else for a legacy."

1650
01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:17.286
<i>You've learned enough about me
to know that I'm a busy boy.</i>

1651
01:30:17.286 --> 01:30:20.748
<i>I'm always wanting to do something.</i>

1652
01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:22.542
<i>Um...</i>

1653
01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:24.627
it's in Word. I think.

1654
01:30:24.627 --> 01:30:26.295
Well. I'll get it here.

1655
01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:27.839
I'll find it quicker.

1656
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:30.716
Ah.

1657
01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:33.219
"Thank you so much. Dr. Mew.

1658
01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:36.973
Your study is worth a Nobel Prize.

1659
01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:41.727
It feels so good that
there are still honorable men

1660
01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:46.023
like Dr. Mew and his son Dr. Mike Mew

1661
01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:49.777
in the evil world of dentistry."
That's a bit strong.

1662
01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.741
<i>I'll tell you. John Mew's life</i>

1663
01:30:55.741 --> 01:31:00.496
<i>would be infinitely better
and more fulfilled</i>

1664
01:31:00.496 --> 01:31:04.458
if he had the orthodontists of the world

1665
01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:07.628
beating a path to his door and saying.

1666
01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:12.008
"We admire you. We respect you.
You are our guru."

1667
01:31:13.509 --> 01:31:19.056
{\an8}<i>He--he needs respect.
and he needs adulation.</i>

1668
01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:23.227
<i>And I don't think it matters to him
all that much where it comes from</i>

1669
01:31:23.227 --> 01:31:24.896
<i>as long as he gets the adulation.</i>

1670
01:31:26.355 --> 01:31:29.692
However. I think John Mew has. uh...

1671
01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:35.907
Actually done something good.
at long last. in his life.

1672
01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:40.077
He's done something good
by making you interested

1673
01:31:40.077 --> 01:31:42.663
in making this documentary.

1674
01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.957
because it brings to the surface

1675
01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:47.376
a number of issues

1676
01:31:47.376 --> 01:31:50.296
which characterize orthodontics.

1677
01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:54.342
<i>Whether it's John Mew doing it</i>

1678
01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:58.429
{\an8}<i>or whether it's the average
good guy orthodontist.</i>

1679
01:31:58.429 --> 01:32:00.848
{\an8}Only those dentists
who successfully complete

1680
01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:02.725
specialist training are entitled

1681
01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:04.143
<i>to call themselves orthodontists.</i>

1682
01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:07.146
<i>And orthodontists understand
tooth movement</i>

1683
01:32:07.146 --> 01:32:09.482
<i>and the guidance of facial development.</i>

1684
01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:12.568
<i>Orthodontists do one thing.
and we do it well.</i>

1685
01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:14.612
Orthodontics has become a business.

1686
01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:18.824
<i>And because orthodontists
have to sell something.</i>

1687
01:32:18.824 --> 01:32:20.409
<i>they fabricate things.</i>

1688
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.579
<i>There are no diseases</i>

1689
01:32:23.579 --> 01:32:27.124
associated with malocclusion
at all-- None.

1690
01:32:31.087 --> 01:32:34.048
But if there is no disease.
what are you measuring?

1691
01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:36.926
<i>It's purely subjective.
It doesn't matter a damn.</i>

1692
01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:41.097
<i>How do the Mews convince people</i>

1693
01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:43.933
<i>that there is some merit in what they say?</i>

1694
01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:48.813
They do it partly by terminology.
by medicalizing orthodontics.

1695
01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:53.567
How many adults are gonna die
ten or 20 years early

1696
01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:55.486
because of craniofacial dystrophy?

1697
01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:57.655
And you're made to feel guilty

1698
01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:59.824
<i>if you don't save your child</i>

1699
01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:02.576
{\an8}<i>from this horrible thing
that they might have</i>

1700
01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:04.245
{\an8}<i>if they don't get the treatment.</i>

1701
01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.163
{\an8}<i>To me. you're doing a public service</i>

1702
01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:09.166
{\an8}by exposing these fictions

1703
01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:11.877
which are dressed up as health needs.

1704
01:33:11.877 --> 01:33:14.422
Here we are.
Now put your jaw forward. can you?

1705
01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.923
That's right.

1706
01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.925
<i>John Mew is not unique.</i>

1707
01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:21.012
<i>What he's doing is just a replication</i>

1708
01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:23.347
<i>of the same shoddy orthodontics.</i>

1709
01:33:23.347 --> 01:33:26.183
I don't care whether he calls it
orthoptics or whatever.

1710
01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:28.394
<i>He is just a continuation</i>

1711
01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:31.063
<i>of what's been going on for more years</i>

1712
01:33:31.063 --> 01:33:33.649
<i>than John Mew has been in orthodontics.</i>

1713
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:37.153
Orthodontists are simply there
to straighten your teeth.

1714
01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.613
make your face look as good as possible.

1715
01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.032
and that should be good enough.

1716
01:33:42.074 --> 01:33:44.035
It's just like being a hairdresser.

1717
01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.245
I'll hold the mirror.
Now you try that yourself.

1718
01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:51.417
That's right. Now...

1719
01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:53.794
<i>And that's why I think. ultimately.</i>

1720
01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:57.590
<i>orthodontics.
including the Mew phenomenon.</i>

1721
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:59.675
<i>is destined to die.</i>

1722
01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:02.678
You can fool some
of the people all of the time.

1723
01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:07.224
but you're not going to succeed.
because people see through it.

1724
01:34:08.559 --> 01:34:11.520
It's extraordinary that someone can say

1725
01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.148
people's face should look like this.

1726
01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:16.317
It's subjective. isn't it?
So how can you define it?

1727
01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.319
- Well. it's appalling. really.
- How can you define it?

1728
01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.988
- Isn't it? When I think about it.
- The nose to teeth is 38 millimeters.

1729
01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:23.240
Yeah. I mean. how--

1730
01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:27.244
I mean. if he thought that Quentin's face

1731
01:34:27.244 --> 01:34:29.955
could be perfect. and yet he'd be--

1732
01:34:30.956 --> 01:34:33.459
and let Ben go
and have any old treatment--

1733
01:34:33.459 --> 01:34:37.421
But mine was already perfect.
so I didn't need...

1734
01:34:37.421 --> 01:34:38.381
Yeah. but--

1735
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:40.091
Well. actually.
that's not a bad thing for us.

1736
01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:43.928
'cause we wanted to get to that point
where we had our own identity.

1737
01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.930
to get to a point where.
if that is the case

1738
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.432
that John Mew thinks everyone should have

1739
01:34:48.432 --> 01:34:53.187
a set distance between nose line and chin.

1740
01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:55.147
then that eradicates that identity.

1741
01:34:55.147 --> 01:34:59.235
individualism. and-- which is--

1742
01:34:59.235 --> 01:35:01.195
that's gotta be questionable.

1743
01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.300
So it's almost time.

1744
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.262
I've gotta head up
to this case at the GDC.

1745
01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:27.721
This is the first day.

1746
01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:31.976
I've already been warned that they want
to consider delaying it.

1747
01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.477
What you call it?
Adjourning it for a while.

1748
01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:37.022
It's a disaster for me.
I mean. however. into London we go.

1749
01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:42.153
{\an8}<i>Some orthodontists
are calling Mewing a scam</i>

1750
01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:46.031
{\an8}<i>and trying to revoke his dental license.</i>

1751
01:35:46.031 --> 01:35:49.577
{\an8}<i>So go sign the petition in the link below</i>

1752
01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:52.371
{\an8}<i>to help save Mike Mew's
orthodontic license.</i>

1753
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:57.668
<i>The buildup to this day
has been at least five years.</i>

1754
01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:02.506
<i>Zarina was one year old when this started.</i>

1755
01:36:02.506 --> 01:36:06.177
<i>She's now six. so most of her life.</i>

1756
01:36:15.394 --> 01:36:18.898
{\an8}<i>Dr. Mew. thank you for agreeing
to join me on JawHacks</i>

1757
01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:21.317
{\an8}<i>to discuss your situation.</i>

1758
01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:22.985
{\an8}<i>You are going up against what seems to be</i>

1759
01:36:22.985 --> 01:36:24.778
{\an8}<i>this tidal wave of orthodontists.</i>

1760
01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:26.947
<i>It's almost like a kind
of information warfare</i>

1761
01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:27.907
<i>that they're levying against you.</i>

1762
01:36:27.907 --> 01:36:31.160
<i>and I can see that it's put you</i>

1763
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.953
<i>at a great amount of distress.</i>

1764
01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:37.166
<i>Now. do you think if you had
never become a YouTube legend</i>

1765
01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.251
<i>with your ideas that have. quite frankly.</i>

1766
01:36:39.251 --> 01:36:42.004
lifted so many young people
up out of despair.

1767
01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:44.381
<i>would you have been spared the gauntlet?</i>

1768
01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:45.674
<i>Uh. with no question.</i>

1769
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.973
<i>I'm really surprised
how much it's affected my wife.</i>

1770
01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.725
<i>This morning. she didn't want
to get out of bed.</i>

1771
01:36:54.725 --> 01:36:56.101
<i>She didn't want to come downstairs.</i>

1772
01:36:56.101 --> 01:37:00.147
She was... depressed.

1773
01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.690
How else do I say it?

1774
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.777
<i>Well. you've started
the revolution already.</i>

1775
01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:07.279
<i>There's already a whole
generation of young people</i>

1776
01:37:07.279 --> 01:37:09.990
out there who are looking
to take the candle.

1777
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.700
- take the torch and run with it.
- Yeah.

1778
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.370
<i>When's this whole legal mess
gonna be over. Mike?</i>

1779
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.622
<i>It runs for four weeks.</i>

1780
01:37:16.622 --> 01:37:18.749
Murder cases are only usually two weeks.

1781
01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:24.213
{\an8}It's nice to see you in the light.

1782
01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.340
{\an8}You feel real.

1783
01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.717
{\an8}- We met. though?
- No.

1784
01:37:28.717 --> 01:37:31.512
<i>Three people are going
to decide my fate.</i>

1785
01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:37.142
And I feel they're gonna decide

1786
01:37:37.142 --> 01:37:42.106
the fate of the health
of the people of the planet.

1787
01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:45.109
- I'm here for the case of Mew.
- Yes.

1788
01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.365
<i>John Mew speaking.</i>

1789
01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:36.160
- Dad. it's Mike.
<i>- Yes. Mike.</i>

1790
01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.579
So what's happening is

1791
01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:40.164
that they're gonna delay it.

1792
01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:45.502
You know. I wish we could be
further along the line.

1793
01:38:45.502 --> 01:38:47.671
I wish we could have got this further.

1794
01:38:47.671 --> 01:38:53.218
but... it is what it is.

1795
01:38:53.218 --> 01:38:56.055
And I'm in this place.
And there's no closure.

1796
01:38:56.055 --> 01:39:00.392
And... it's not an ideal scenario.

1797
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:11.195
As you know. the GDC made
an application to adjourn.

1798
01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.864
But so look. Mike. That's where we are.

1799
01:39:13.864 --> 01:39:15.032
What's going to happen

1800
01:39:15.032 --> 01:39:17.368
throughout the rest
of the year. unfortunately.

1801
01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:18.911
is I suspect that when they're done

1802
01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:22.665
going back for two.
maybe even three tranches

1803
01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:25.834
of two or three weeks spread out

1804
01:39:25.834 --> 01:39:29.421
over probably a few months in the year.

1805
01:39:29.421 --> 01:39:32.841
How long-- What's the worst-case scenario?
Spread out of six months?

1806
01:39:32.841 --> 01:39:36.887
Um. no. worst case scenario.
maybe spread out over 12 months.

1807
01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.477
Yeah. Yeah.

1808
01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.270
Yeah. Okay. [clears throat] Okay.

1809
01:39:46.188 --> 01:39:47.815
<i>What today's been about is waiting.</i>

1810
01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:50.234
<i>waiting on other people
to make these decisions about your life.</i>

1811
01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.319
<i>And it's excruciating.</i>

1812
01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:56.990
You know. it really-- It's painful.

1813
01:39:57.783 --> 01:39:59.952
<i>At no point has my father ever had</i>

1814
01:39:59.952 --> 01:40:02.830
<i>any proper formal engagement
on his ideas and theories.</i>

1815
01:40:04.915 --> 01:40:06.667
<i>I mean. how much longer can he hang on?</i>

1816
01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:08.877
<i>He's still. you know--
I think the only reason</i>

1817
01:40:08.877 --> 01:40:11.463
<i>he's still mentally just there</i>

1818
01:40:11.463 --> 01:40:13.257
<i>is because this is going somewhere.</i>

1819
01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:16.719
<i>And if he doesn't get to see
the end of this court call.</i>

1820
01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:18.345
<i>I will lose my temper.</i>

1821
01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:20.389
<i>I will never forgive.</i>

1822
01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:22.683
That would just...

1823
01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:54.506
- Hey. Mum.
- Hi. lovely.

1824
01:40:54.506 --> 01:40:55.716
- I'll take that.
- Hey. gorgeous.

1825
01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:57.259
Yeah. you can carry that for me.

1826
01:40:57.259 --> 01:41:00.053
Hello. Hello.

1827
01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.305
Hello. lovely.

1828
01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.599
- Oh. just put it here. darling.
- Lovely.

1829
01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:04.975
Thanks. darling. that's perfect.

1830
01:41:04.975 --> 01:41:06.852
Hello. birthday boy.

1831
01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:11.064
Hello. sweetheart.
Why is it that sound is working full on?

1832
01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:14.568
Oh. Hello. Hello. darling daughter.

1833
01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:15.778
I don't know. Dad.

1834
01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:17.488
Actually. that's quite a good video.

1835
01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.531
even if I say so myself.

1836
01:41:19.531 --> 01:41:21.617
The queen's going through
Edinburgh at the moment.

1837
01:41:21.617 --> 01:41:24.912
Coffin's now arrived in Holyrood.

1838
01:41:26.705 --> 01:41:28.457
I think Charles
will be an amazing king.

1839
01:41:28.457 --> 01:41:30.584
but unfortunately. he's not her.

1840
01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.920
His ears stick out
and his face has swung down.

1841
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.380
Oh. well. Michael. you can't
put it all down to facial form.

1842
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.217
Sorry. Charles has a big problem.
His face didn't grow well.

1843
01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:40.344
Well. I don't think
you can blame it all on that.

1844
01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:44.223
I think he didn't choose well
in his marriage.

1845
01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.350
For love. I think Diana
was an amazing person.

1846
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:47.935
but I think. unfortunately.
they weren't a good--

1847
01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.270
- But she was pretty. and he wasn't.
- They weren't a good match.

1848
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:52.731
Yeah. I don't think--
You can't put it all down to aesthetics.

1849
01:41:52.731 --> 01:41:53.774
Dad. Dad.

1850
01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:56.985
Oh. my goodness. you're so fast.

1851
01:41:56.985 --> 01:42:00.614
Hey. Dad. Dad. have you been
watching Jessica's face?

1852
01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.324
- Have you noticed--
- Her face?

1853
01:42:02.324 --> 01:42:04.117
Have you noticed her face
has come along lots

1854
01:42:04.117 --> 01:42:05.285
in the last six months?

1855
01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:09.164
I notice her all the time.
And yes. I do think.

1856
01:42:09.164 --> 01:42:12.459
What has really helped
is lip taping at night

1857
01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:14.586
- and all the gum chewing.
- Yeah. I'm sure.

1858
01:42:14.586 --> 01:42:17.506
I'm still thinking.
what is her indicator line?

1859
01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:18.465
It'll be too high.

1860
01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:20.092
You know it'll be too high. But it's--

1861
01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:22.302
Yes. but that's why I'm thinking--

1862
01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:23.637
Yeah. I know. I know. I know.

1863
01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:27.850
I couldn't do-- I couldn't put Jessica
through a whole course of therapy.

1864
01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:31.019
But as you know. I'm always ambitious

1865
01:42:31.019 --> 01:42:33.605
and I'm always optimistic about it.

1866
01:42:33.605 --> 01:42:36.567
Oh. my goodness. Jesse.
that is a mega one.

1867
01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:38.360
- Okay. so all right. we need--
- Don't swear.

1868
01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.445
I need a couple of volunteers
to help me light this.

1869
01:42:40.445 --> 01:42:41.697
Totally. I'm in.

1870
01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.039
<i>Yeah but
last year we had 93 candles</i>

1871
01:42:51.039 --> 01:42:54.793
<i>and if you remember.
I've never seen such a bonfire.</i>

1872
01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.256
- Ready. ready. ready.
- Cheers!

1873
01:43:01.216 --> 01:43:03.468
- Happy birthday. Poppa!
- Happy birthday.

1874
01:43:03.468 --> 01:43:06.471
Happy birthday!

1875
01:43:06.471 --> 01:43:08.932
<i>Jessica. cheers!</i>

1876
01:43:08.932 --> 01:43:10.642
<i>Cheers.</i>

1877
01:43:16.106 --> 01:43:17.441
Wish. wish. have a wish?

1878
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:18.775
Have a wish?

1879
01:43:18.775 --> 01:43:19.818
- Blow! Blow!
- A wish?

1880
01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:21.153
All right. I wish that I--

1881
01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:22.362
Now blow.

1882
01:43:22.905 --> 01:43:25.782
Quick. before the whole place
goes up in flames.

1883
01:43:32.748 --> 01:43:35.208
- What was your wish. Dad?
- What was your wish for?

1884
01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.252
- I'm not allowed to say.
- Why?

1885
01:43:37.252 --> 01:43:39.546
- I'm gonna make--
- Because it won't come true.

1886
01:43:42.257 --> 01:43:44.134
<i>It is very hard to change</i>

1887
01:43:44.134 --> 01:43:46.929
<i>the opinion of the entire world.</i>

1888
01:43:46.929 --> 01:43:51.808
<i>But I'm amazed how many people now Mew</i>

1889
01:43:51.808 --> 01:43:55.896
<i>or adopt Mewing. which bears my name.</i>

1890
01:43:55.896 --> 01:44:00.651
<i>And it shows that the public
have actually accepted this--</i>

1891
01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:03.278
<i>I should call this in advance--</i>

1892
01:44:03.278 --> 01:44:05.697
<i>much more than the orthodontists.</i>

1893
01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:10.285
<i>I'm sure Michael will inherit my legacy.</i>

1894
01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:17.167
<i>In a way. I feel guilty
because I led him into it</i>

1895
01:44:17.167 --> 01:44:19.920
<i>and he willingly followed.</i>

1896
01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.381
<i>But should I have done?</i>

1897
01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:26.218
<i>Should I have ever attempted
to change the world at all?</i>

1898
01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:30.889
Dad. you were
the first by a long. long way

1899
01:44:30.889 --> 01:44:32.015
of putting it all together.

1900
01:44:32.015 --> 01:44:34.643
understanding what was really happening.

1901
01:44:34.643 --> 01:44:36.478
What were the terms it goes. you know.

1902
01:44:36.478 --> 01:44:39.147
they say it doesn't exist.
then they fight you.

1903
01:44:39.147 --> 01:44:41.233
then eventually they say.
"Oh. but it's obvious."

1904
01:44:41.233 --> 01:44:42.192
It's acceptance.

1905
01:44:42.192 --> 01:44:44.486
They say. "It's obvious.
We always knew that. It was obvious."

1906
01:44:44.486 --> 01:44:47.280
Yeah. I'm a dreamer. And hopefully--
I know. and I've put my life

1907
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.825
on the line for a dream. I have.

1908
01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:51.118
Your father's dream.

1909
01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.744
Yes. it was my father's dream.

1910
01:44:52.744 --> 01:44:54.079
God. what the odds are--

1911
01:44:57.708 --> 01:45:01.336
<i>People who aren't aesthetic
sometimes just don't see it.</i>

1912
01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:02.713
<i>They don't--</i>

1913
01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:04.589
<i>Well. I'm amazed how orthodontists</i>

1914
01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:06.925
<i>don't see facial change.</i>

1915
01:45:06.925 --> 01:45:09.636
<i>No. a lot of people
are just immune to art.</i>

1916
01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:11.763
<i>It's interesting.
I guess you're right. though.</i>

1917
01:45:11.763 --> 01:45:14.975
<i>They're immune.
They just. you know. they don't see art.</i>

1918
01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.186
<i>They don't see art in the same way
and they don't get the same appreciation.</i>

1919
01:45:18.186 --> 01:45:21.273
<i>And in a way. I would say
this is an element of art.</i>

1920
01:45:21.273 --> 01:45:23.650
<i>To appreciate beauty
is to appreciate art.</i>

1921
01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:24.693
<i>Yeah.</i>

1922
01:46:06.818 --> 01:46:11.364
I-- I do think because
what I've said is different.

1923
01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.241
it will be recorded.

1924
01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:16.995
And ultimately.
I don't have the slightest doubt

1925
01:46:16.995 --> 01:46:21.333
that orthotropics
will displace orthodontics.

1926
01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:23.919
That. in a way.
is quite an important thing.

1927
01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:28.090
and I suppose that in future.
people will write that down and say.

1928
01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:30.092
"This guy John Mew thought it up."

1929
01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:33.804
But. you know.
I'm gonna be dead. so it won't affect me.
