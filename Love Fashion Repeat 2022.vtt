00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:13.986
<i>... Lisa Holt!</i>

4
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.366
<i>Meena: Hello?</i>

5
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.019
Meena! Hi. I can't wait
to see you.

6
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:48.934
<i>It's been too long. Lis.</i>

7
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.022
I know. That is entirely
my fault.

8
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:51.502
I bet you're glowing.

9
00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:53.896
I am. I'm so happy you're
coming back.

10
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.985
Yeah. guess I have
Aunty Mavis's house

11
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.552
to take care of now.
don't I?

12
00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.380
Lis. you ok?

13
00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:03.166
Yeah. it's just. that house
is Aunty Mavis.

14
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.909
Hey. do you remember when we
used to sit out on the porch

15
00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:08.389
and she would teach us stitches

16
00:02:08.563 --> 00:02:10.042
between playing cards
with our moms?

17
00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:11.218
Yes. And you wanted to keep
it in the family.

18
00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:13.568
It is such a beautiful house.

19
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.439
And I get to be there
for your big day.

20
00:02:15.613 --> 00:02:16.962
<i>You're really gonna be there?</i>

21
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.660
Wouldn't miss it.

22
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:19.835
Plus. someone's gotta be there
to hold David up.

23
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.663
I heard that.

24
00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:25.623
Stop. He's a firefighter.
He'll be fine... I think.

25
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:26.929
I'll put these in the car.

26
00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:28.800
-Fine.
-Thank you.

27
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.193
Ok. Meena. I gotta go.

28
00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:30.976
Bye.

29
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.108
Talk soon.

30
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:34.850
There's been rumblings.

31
00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:35.894
Rumblings?

32
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:37.244
Retail rumblings.

33
00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:38.810
Hm.

34
00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:41.073
Dropping your clothing line.
rumblings.

35
00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:43.902
Well. should we be worried?

36
00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:46.253
Let's stay positive.

37
00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:48.994
Ok. um. actually I could
use some help.

38
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.953
I'm packing up my samples
to donate

39
00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:52.259
to my junior high school
for prom.

40
00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:53.999
That's my girl.

41
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.959
But I'm not messing these
beauties up for anyone.

42
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.613
How's the spring and summer
line coming along?

43
00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:01.442
Good. I got the first few pieces
off to Salvatore.

44
00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.921
We need these to sell.

45
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:04.401
I know.

46
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.273
We have that meeting
with Felicity.

47
00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:07.926
My memoir.

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.278
How I got to here.

49
00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:12.757
Got where?

50
00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:15.891
Jean-Marc.
What do you want?

51
00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.459
Espressos from Antony's.

52
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:19.808
Thank you.

53
00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:22.724
Christine?

54
00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.814
Just to be clear.

55
00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:27.642
this is no way puts us back
on the relationship path.

56
00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:29.513
That ship has sailed.
understood?

57
00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:31.167
Of course.

58
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.604
So...

59
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.652
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

60
00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:40.045
I can't help it.

61
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.179
You still take
my breath away.

62
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.487
Uh. too much?

63
00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:52.188
I'm thinking of getting back
into the fashion game. Lisa.

64
00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:53.972
In a big way.

65
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:57.889
Oh. well you have amazing
fashion sense. Jean-Marc.

66
00:03:58.063 --> 00:03:59.500
Good luck. I mean it.

67
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:00.544
Thank you.

68
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.854
I've heard there's lots of
movement in retail.

69
00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:09.336
Brands. entire lines
being dropped.

70
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.728
What do you mean?

71
00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:15.080
It was nice seeing you.

72
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.519
And you. Christine.
always a pleasure.

73
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.042
Ciao.

74
00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.318
It's a little flat.

75
00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:36.754
The writer and I...

76
00:04:36.928 --> 00:04:40.062
Didn't connect. It shows
in the work.

77
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.630
Bottom line. Felicity.

78
00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:45.067
In its current state.
it is unpublishable.

79
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:48.592
So. last month I gave the
manuscript to Colin Davenport.

80
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.116
Great biographer. ghost written
multiple best sellers.

81
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.901
He started on the rewrite
and is gonna meet with you

82
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:54.990
to iron out some of the details.

83
00:04:55.164 --> 00:04:56.470
Well. just have him shoot me
some emails

84
00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.385
and I will answer his questions.

85
00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.910
He doesn't work like that. it's
more of an immersive approach.

86
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:05.087
And. full disclosure.
he's an old college friend.

87
00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:10.832
Well. I actually just bought
my great aunt Mavis's house

88
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:12.616
up in Logenburgh. Connecticut.

89
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.618
I'm gonna be setting up shop
there for a while.

90
00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:16.968
Hoping to get some inspiration
for my spring and summer line

91
00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:19.014
and my best friend
is having a baby.

92
00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:22.104
so I couldn't possibly
meet with him.

93
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:23.671
He's in Logenburgh.

94
00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:25.325
I confirmed with Christine
beforehand.

95
00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.589
it's what made this
a good fit all around.

96
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.504
Sent you an email.

97
00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.028
What if I don't agree
with his vision?

98
00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:34.464
His wife was a fashion
journalist.

99
00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:35.944
so he's well-versed
in that world.

100
00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:37.337
Was?

101
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.295
She passed away
a few years ago.

102
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:40.992
Oh. that's so sad.

103
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:42.994
It was. For everyone.

104
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.082
Do they have kids?

105
00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.084
A daughter.

106
00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:48.173
He got so good at fixing other
people's literary problems.

107
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.002
he's neglected his own
original work.

108
00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:57.574
Well. can he do it
and not drive me crazy?

109
00:05:57.748 --> 00:05:58.706
Absolutely.

110
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:03.798
I'm hoping my memoir's release

111
00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:05.452
can coincide with my spring
and summer line.

112
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.627
Synergy.

113
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.455
Piggy backing one off the other.

114
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.457
Then. let's make this work.

115
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:12.284
Colin has an absolute knack
for finding the heart and soul

116
00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.025
of a project.

117
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.464
'Cause right now. this book
doesn't have much.

118
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:28.736
It's a big deal.

119
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.606
I mean a New York designer
coming here?

120
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.391
I know it is.

121
00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:32.914
And you're gonna be working
with her on a book.

122
00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:34.306
A memoir. Maybe.

123
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:36.134
She has to want to work
with me.

124
00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:37.875
Well. you're gonna have to
up your game.

125
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.529
Oh yeah?

126
00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:41.401
Just don't get all.
like. argumentative. ok?

127
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:43.881
Well. it depends how
she takes the changes.

128
00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:46.318
Well. change can be hard
on some people.

129
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:49.844
That's true. but it's all about
the work. right?

130
00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:51.106
Well I better get to meet her.

131
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.890
Did you see her fall line?

132
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:54.065
I must have missed it.

133
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:55.893
The whole thing. gorgeous.

134
00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:57.939
Ok. Good to know.

135
00:06:58.113 --> 00:06:59.549
So does this mean that you're
gonna be getting into fashion?

136
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:01.421
Maybe. I don't know.

137
00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:03.945
I might be good at a few things.
so it's hard to decide.

138
00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:05.381
Renaissance woman.

139
00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:08.384
Like I said. can I please
meet her?

140
00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:10.342
Hang with Grandma for a little
bit while I'm in my meeting

141
00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:14.085
and maybe afterwards
you can meet her.

142
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.332
Oh no. he's in
the discount bin?

143
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:46.074
I hear that one's
not very good.

144
00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:49.120
Yeah. it's probably
just bathroom reading.

145
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.127
Colin Davenport.

146
00:07:57.564 --> 00:07:59.391
Lisa Holt.

147
00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:02.307
You're taller in real life.

148
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.527
Well. perspective's everything.

149
00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.320
So. when you were 16.
your dad was transferred here

150
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.584
and then you spent a year
at an all-girls prep school.

151
00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.411
which you hated.

152
00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:22.458
And then after graduation
you moved to New York full-time.

153
00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:24.895
where you interned
for an absolute diva.

154
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:25.809
Yeah.

155
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:29.030
And then I got lucky because
an up-and-coming pop star

156
00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:31.336
liked my revamp of
a vintage jacket.

157
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.035
which was part imagination
and part of it was all
I could afford.

158
00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:42.957
So. the book.
as it stands now?

159
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:45.307
First. can I tell you
how I work?

160
00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:46.961
Sure.

161
00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:48.876
Well. I like to observe you.
in the present

162
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.921
to give life to your past.

163
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:52.706
Ok.

164
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.012
There were some parts that
I was really gripped by.

165
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:58.886
but much of it came across
like an...

166
00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.974
Go on.

167
00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.455
An extended puff piece.

168
00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:07.111
I put a lot of work into that.

169
00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:10.506
I know you did. but it's still
missing you.

170
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.117
How you became you.

171
00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:16.338
But I'm on every page?

172
00:09:16.512 --> 00:09:18.819
It was more of an account
of what you did.

173
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:20.821
without emotion
it just sits there.

174
00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:24.259
We need to tell the story.

175
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:25.869
This isn't just a story to me.

176
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:28.176
I mean. that's my life
on those pages.

177
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.093
So let's put some life
in those pages.

178
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:34.486
You know. I thought we were
just gonna like.

179
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:35.923
change a few things.

180
00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:37.185
A paragraph here.
a sentence there.

181
00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:41.363
I know. this must sting.

182
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:45.019
Maybe this isn't the best time
for this.

183
00:09:45.193 --> 00:09:48.370
Because of your line potentially
being dropped?

184
00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:53.375
I have some friends in the
business still because of Julie.

185
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.686
So you mentioned an aunt.

186
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.386
A great aunt. actually.
Mavis Thorpe.

187
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.257
Mavis?

188
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.869
She was an amazing woman.

189
00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:10.087
I got to spend some time
with her

190
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.437
during the town archive project.

191
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.876
I ended up writing
a big character piece
on her. actually.

192
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.269
I would love to see it.

193
00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:20.532
I will email you a copy.

194
00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:22.970
That would be great.

195
00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:24.536
I have to pick up
my daughter. Kira.

196
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.538
She's at my mother-in-law's
bookstore.

197
00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.411
where I am currently
in the discount bin.

198
00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:35.069
And she is desperate
to meet you.

199
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:40.901
So nice to meet you. Kira.

200
00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:42.685
This is so cool.
Can I post this?

201
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.600
I loved what you did
with plaid in the fall.

202
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.951
Did you go to design school
and do you sew your own clothes?

203
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.432
Yes you can post this.

204
00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:52.434
I also love plaid in the fall.

205
00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.610
I did go to design school and
I only sew some of my clothes.

206
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:57.961
I did make this skirt.

207
00:10:58.135 --> 00:10:59.441
I love it.

208
00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:02.879
Um. I'm sorry.

209
00:11:03.053 --> 00:11:04.576
I gotta run. 'cause I'm closing
on the house today.

210
00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:05.969
I will dig up and find you
that character piece

211
00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:07.231
I did on your Aunt Mavis.

212
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:09.190
Give it a read.

213
00:11:09.364 --> 00:11:11.366
I think I can do your memoir
even better.

214
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.455
He really is pretty good.

215
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:18.852
Oh. before you go...
do you mind?

216
00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.462
Oh. sure.

217
00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:22.856
All right.

218
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:25.902
-Thank you.
-Of course.

219
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.034
There you go.

220
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.472
Oh. thank you.

221
00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:34.868
I will text you. and Kira.
it was lovely to meet you.

222
00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:35.782
Bye.

223
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.440
So?

224
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:45.617
Uh... hmm.

225
00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:50.535
It's ok. Mom.

226
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.537
No. no you and Dad just.
yeah. just stay there.

227
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.149
I know. I know that's why
you guys moved down to Florida.

228
00:11:55.323 --> 00:11:59.022
I know. I know. I just...
Yeah. I'll be fine.

229
00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:00.502
Yes. yeah.

230
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:01.459
Next big holiday you guys
come up. ok?

231
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.939
Ok. I love you too.

232
00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:07.335
Oh. it's so good to see you.
Lis.

233
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:08.510
Look at you!

234
00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:09.511
Oh. look at you.

235
00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:10.991
Oh.

236
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:11.992
Are you ready?

237
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:12.993
Yes. Let's go.

238
00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.646
Ok. Let's do it.

239
00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:29.836
It's so quiet.

240
00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:33.970
Uncle Henry always used to be
putting around

241
00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:37.017
and Aunt Mavis. sitting on
the porch. sewing.

242
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:39.236
hemming someone's dress.

243
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.108
It's where it all started
for you.

244
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:42.718
Me too.

245
00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:48.071
Well. great place to try to get
my groove back. right?

246
00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:50.073
How are you feeling about
the line now?

247
00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:54.077
Um. well. the designs I sent off
to Salvatore are a real

248
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.036
return to form for me.

249
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.473
so I just have a couple more
to go and then I should be good.

250
00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.909
Then. maybe I can...

251
00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:01.693
You can concentrate
on romance?

252
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.913
I was gonna say relax
and catch my breath. but...

253
00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:06.176
Sure. Lis. You catch
your breath.

254
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.351
Yeah.

255
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:08.962
Then. maybe.

256
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.268
Ok. you are incorrigible.
Shastakovich.

257
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:14.010
I prefer hopeless romantic.

258
00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:17.405
Oh. well maybe that's
the hormones talking. huh?

259
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.755
Quiet. or you're gonna
make me cry.

260
00:13:28.372 --> 00:13:29.591
Ok.

261
00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:30.897
Shall we get started?

262
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.768
Let's do this.

263
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.630
So. what did that writer guy
say about your memoir?

264
00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:11.154
He said that it lacked feeling.

265
00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:17.117
What?

266
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.510
You don't think that's true?

267
00:14:19.684 --> 00:14:23.123
Not the words I'd use.
Depth. maybe?

268
00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:27.214
My editor said the same thing.

269
00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:30.608
Ok. Lis. I love you
like the sister I never had.

270
00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:34.830
but the person in that book
is a hollow version of you.

271
00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:37.050
Maybe he can add some feeling?

272
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.835
Have you read anything
of his yet?

273
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:41.663
No.

274
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:44.144
He did send me an article
he wrote about Aunty Mavis.

275
00:14:51.194 --> 00:14:53.457
First things first.
How's Kira?

276
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.939
She's a teenager who's becoming
a little bit of a fashion diva.

277
00:14:57.113 --> 00:14:59.028
<i>Oh. poor you.</i>

278
00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:00.943
Has she bugged you about
wearing make up?

279
00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:03.467
Please. don't even joke
about that.

280
00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:05.339
How did the meet go with Lisa?

281
00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:07.036
I don't think she likes
criticism.

282
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.430
It's like a foreign concept
to her.

283
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.475
You didn't say that to her.
did you?

284
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:12.999
Kind of.

285
00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:15.523
Now. your comeback novel.

286
00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:18.047
Hefty advance and you're
dreadfully behind.

287
00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:19.527
You know what Lionel's like.

288
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:21.355
he wanted to garnish
your writing fee.

289
00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:23.357
He only agreed not to
because you're in Logenburgh

290
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.011
and you could get her memoir
back on track.

291
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.187
So. I'm in fence mending
mode now?

292
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.884
Yes. Colin.

293
00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:30.842
You're almost finished
your book.

294
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:32.322
If I can show him more than
etchings on a cocktail napkin.

295
00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:33.758
he'll be happy.

296
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.891
Otherwise. he's giving it
to legal.

297
00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:37.458
<i>I don't even like riding in</i>
<i>the elevator with those guys.</i>

298
00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:38.938
It's like being in the cage
with the sharks.

299
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:39.939
Ok.

300
00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:42.071
I will dust it off.

301
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:45.161
I know that one's personal
for you. but it's time.

302
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:48.556
<i>Back to the Holt bio.</i>

303
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.558
I don't know if she's gonna go
for it or not.

304
00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:53.387
You're actually her lifeline
on this one.

305
00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:57.043
Ok. Then I will try
and be tactful.

306
00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:58.566
I have a really good feeling
about Lisa.

307
00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.959
She has a lot of character.

308
00:16:00.133 --> 00:16:02.091
I can see that.

309
00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:04.006
<i>Let's get those pages coming</i>
<i>in and get your book going.</i>

310
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.835
You only gave me the first three
chapters but they were terrific.

311
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:08.880
I know you're close
to finishing.

312
00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:10.578
Goodbye. Felicity.

313
00:16:18.064 --> 00:16:19.456
That was beautiful.

314
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.112
Ok. So the man can write.

315
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.382
Colin Davenport.

316
00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:33.383
Hm.

317
00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:59.105
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

318
00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.542
Look. I'm sorry.

319
00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:03.500
I can be a little blunt
with criticism.

320
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:05.372
Oh. it's ok.

321
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:08.462
I suppose there's a kernel
of truth to your comments.

322
00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:12.074
A very small. husk-like kernel
of truth.

323
00:17:14.163 --> 00:17:15.817
The piece you wrote
on my aunt was amazing.

324
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:17.166
You're a really great writer.

325
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.125
Thank you.

326
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.997
That means a lot. and I really
respect you as a designer.

327
00:17:22.171 --> 00:17:23.955
Kira's been giving me
an education.

328
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.087
Oh.

329
00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.134
My memoir could possibly benefit

330
00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:31.920
from a little more
emotional depth.

331
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.313
Ok.

332
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:34.966
Now. I have to see you work.

333
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:36.055
A fly on the wall?

334
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:37.839
One who asks questions.

335
00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:39.971
Oh. a talking. inquisitive fly.
Got it.

336
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:42.844
Exactly.

337
00:17:43.018 --> 00:17:47.153
Oh. in that case.
do you mind?

338
00:17:47.327 --> 00:17:48.806
Um...

339
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.460
I like to look back at them
when I'm writing.

340
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:53.463
it helps keep me
in the moment.

341
00:17:53.637 --> 00:17:55.030
Ok.

342
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:03.038
So why don't we start tomorrow?

343
00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:03.995
After I drop Kira off
for school.

344
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.259
Sure.

345
00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:08.261
Oh. but I have a
conference call with buyers
in Paris late tonight.

346
00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:10.872
so if you show up at my house
before 11:30AM

347
00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:13.353
you will be standing
on the porch by yourself.

348
00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.181
Right.

349
00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:39.857
I waited.

350
00:18:40.031 --> 00:18:41.598
It's 11:35AM.

351
00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:43.600
Literal and punctual.

352
00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:46.037
I thought we'd get started?

353
00:18:46.212 --> 00:18:48.388
Not before coffee and pastries.

354
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.390
Coffee and pastries.

355
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.522
Just give me two ticks.

356
00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:09.583
Ready!

357
00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:21.508
-Sit there?
- Yeah.

358
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:30.081
Ok. So. these are the best
in town.

359
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.083
I usually don't eat pastries.

360
00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:34.129
That's crazy talk.

361
00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:38.916
That's amazing.

362
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.353
Mm-hm.

363
00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.006
Bliss.

364
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.618
Try it with a sip of coffee.

365
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:48.796
It's even better.

366
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.364
Right? And it's like it brings
the flavor out.

367
00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:53.975
So. what's next.
Mr. Davenport?

368
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:56.456
So. I am going to need
to ask you some questions

369
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.241
and I need you to be honest
with me. Ok?

370
00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.461
Ok. all my foibles laid bare.

371
00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:03.550
You don't hear the word
"foibles" very often.

372
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:07.989
Yeah. my Aunty Mavis used
to love playing Scrabble.

373
00:20:08.163 --> 00:20:10.861
and we'd play that a lot.
sitting out on the porch.

374
00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:14.213
Speaking of which.
where is Mavis?

375
00:20:15.475 --> 00:20:16.345
Hm?

376
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:17.999
Where is she?

377
00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:19.392
The woman who gave you
your fashion sense.

378
00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:21.176
taught you to sew.
to make patterns.

379
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.917
The whole shebang.

380
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:25.224
How did you become you?

381
00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:29.010
Ok.

382
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.926
Um. let's go find her.

383
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.797
Ok.

384
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:47.594
My aunt used to take me
to these all the time.

385
00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:50.510
Just find old clothes.
recut the outfits.

386
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:53.208
use the fabric.

387
00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:54.992
I do it partly out of habit

388
00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:58.996
and partly because it reminds me
of her.

389
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.868
You get to see the things that
people held dear. you know?

390
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:04.654
That they took care of.
The things that last.

391
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:12.009
Ok. not that.

392
00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:14.882
Sorry. Go on.

393
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:17.232
When I read your piece
on Aunty Mavis.

394
00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:21.105
I mean. as a kid I'd heard
about all the things she did.

395
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.891
but when you put them in
the context of the times.

396
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:28.635
like you did.
it was amazing.

397
00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:30.985
First woman to be elected
to the School Board.

398
00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:32.552
Yeah. where she rocked
the power pantsuit before

399
00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.902
there even really were
power pantsuits.

400
00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:36.904
The little things that make
a big difference.

401
00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:38.645
Yeah. like getting the School
Board to change

402
00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:41.300
the uniform dress code for prom?
That was huge.

403
00:21:41.474 --> 00:21:43.606
And then the girls who couldn't
afford dresses.

404
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.914
she would help them sew.
alter and design new ones.

405
00:21:47.088 --> 00:21:49.090
Even when I was little
and I would help her.

406
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.222
I. I didn't realize how big of
a deal that was. you know?

407
00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:53.181
It was just like something
she did.

408
00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:01.494
Why do you do that?

409
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:04.279
Well. it's a rough fit for me.
size wise

410
00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:07.064
and then I get to see where
it falls on the color pallet.

411
00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:09.328
Spring. summer. fall.

412
00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:11.068
You're a summer.

413
00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:12.722
And you?

414
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.334
Guess.

415
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:19.468
Fall. definitely a fall.

416
00:22:19.642 --> 00:22:20.600
Correct.

417
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.174
There we go.

418
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.656
Good eye.

419
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.094
Now. if it's ok with you I am
gonna send you some questions.

420
00:22:37.268 --> 00:22:38.705
so you can answer them

421
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:41.011
and I can get used to words
to describe you.

422
00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:43.927
I am confused a bit
between boyfriends.

423
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:46.365
So. between New York
and Paris.

424
00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.977
they seem to be
a Jean something.

425
00:22:50.151 --> 00:22:52.414
Well. I guess. when you look
back there seems to be

426
00:22:52.588 --> 00:22:55.156
a definitive Jean phase.

427
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.246
But only one of them. however.
spanned two continents.

428
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.336
and that was Jean-Marc.

429
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.120
The one who broke your heart?

430
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:06.080
Yep. That's the one.

431
00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:07.124
That's not a lot of detail.

432
00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:08.343
Nope.

433
00:23:09.997 --> 00:23:12.347
First adjective that comes
to mind?

434
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:18.266
Broken. betrayed. I don't know.
Crestfallen.

435
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.008
I think I'm gonna leave
crestfallen out of it.

436
00:23:21.182 --> 00:23:23.010
Well. you can use whatever
word you like.

437
00:23:23.184 --> 00:23:25.708
but the rest is off the record.

438
00:23:27.493 --> 00:23:29.451
Oh! Look at those boots.

439
00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:40.331
Tell me about your
first fashion line.

440
00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:42.595
Where'd the inspiration
come from?

441
00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.553
Well. when I finished
at design school.

442
00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:46.903
I lived in a shoebox-sized
apartment

443
00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:49.863
and interned for less than
no money.

444
00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:51.212
Keep it going.

445
00:23:51.386 --> 00:23:52.909
With the money I was making.

446
00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:54.998
three outfits for work
was all I could afford.

447
00:23:55.172 --> 00:23:57.566
But. the way I did it. you could
combine each of them

448
00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.568
and get multiple looks.

449
00:23:59.742 --> 00:24:01.614
So. I could have a different
outfit for every work day

450
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:04.921
and look like I spent a bunch
of money when really. I didn't.

451
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:07.620
That's kind of what I want
my new line to have. you know?

452
00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:11.885
Be something beautiful
that also has this like...

453
00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:13.582
Utility?

454
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.976
Hm. not exactly the word
I would use

455
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:21.416
but I just want the woman
who buys it to feel good in it.

456
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.462
You know. having something
beautiful that fits you well.

457
00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:26.160
it just gives you
so much confidence.

458
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:27.988
Does that make sense?

459
00:24:28.162 --> 00:24:29.946
Be like wearing
Yankee pinstripes.

460
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.993
Huh. I don't know. I don't
really follow sports.

461
00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:34.951
Anyway. I want my spring
and summer line to have

462
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:38.085
that adaptability built in and
a little retro style

463
00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:41.001
as homage to my Aunt Mavis.

464
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:45.266
This is the most excited
I've been about a line in years.

465
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.529
Yeah. Take me through
that process.

466
00:24:54.318 --> 00:24:55.145
Ok.

467
00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:56.973
All that. for ok.

468
00:24:57.147 --> 00:24:59.410
Well. my creative process
is a big part of who I am.

469
00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:02.849
so. I need to be sure.

470
00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:06.113
All your secrets are safe
with me.

471
00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:28.352
I like the lines of this one.

472
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.006
And you're gonna bring
these together

473
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.052
in some way shape or form?

474
00:25:32.226 --> 00:25:34.968
Yeah. hopefully.

475
00:25:35.142 --> 00:25:36.926
Are these yours or hers?

476
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.887
Um. these ones are mine
and those were Aunty Mavis's.

477
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:43.019
Your take on her style.

478
00:25:46.675 --> 00:25:48.416
Here. I'll show you.

479
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.548
Ok.

480
00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:12.092
Great. now you.

481
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:13.354
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

482
00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:17.010
Oh yeah. Come on. sit down.

483
00:26:17.184 --> 00:26:18.533
There is a peddle on the floor

484
00:26:18.707 --> 00:26:20.230
which controls the speed
of the machine.

485
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:22.189
You've lost me already.

486
00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:24.887
Ok. here. put your hands
on the fabric.

487
00:26:25.061 --> 00:26:26.367
-Ok.
-Ok.

488
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.282
Ok. good distance away
from the needle.

489
00:26:28.456 --> 00:26:30.893
And you put a little bit of
pressure on the foot pedal.

490
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:31.938
It'll start going.

491
00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:35.071
Woah!

492
00:26:35.245 --> 00:26:36.029
Great. A little more gas.

493
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:37.030
That's cool.

494
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:38.727
Yeah.

495
00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:44.037
Woah. ok. that's enough.
Step aside. rookie.

496
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:56.658
Here we go.

497
00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:00.053
Ok.

498
00:27:02.272 --> 00:27:03.970
Oh. that's the wrong way.

499
00:27:11.064 --> 00:27:14.154
That's amazing how those
came together.

500
00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:18.419
Well. you know. it's the time
you put in.

501
00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:20.813
So much of that time was
spent chatting with Aunt Mavis.

502
00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:22.989
Just made the time fly.

503
00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:29.473
I have to let the sitter go.

504
00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:34.565
Well. I. I hope this informed
your work.

505
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.045
On that note.

506
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.307
I am gonna send you some
more questions

507
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:39.005
and you just answer them

508
00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:40.963
with the first thing that comes
to mind.

509
00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:44.097
You're gonna know me better
than I know me.

510
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:49.580
Oh. um. I'd like to start each
chapter with a life quote

511
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:51.452
from Aunt Mavis.

512
00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:55.195
I. um... she had some
really good ones.

513
00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:57.110
I love that.

514
00:28:03.986 --> 00:28:04.944
-Good night.
-Good night.

515
00:28:05.118 --> 00:28:06.075
Bye.

516
00:28:19.306 --> 00:28:21.525
How's working with her. Colin?

517
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.137
I'd say pretty good.

518
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:26.835
I'd say two shades
before pretty good.

519
00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:29.142
Oh. I forgot everything revolves
around the color pallet.

520
00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:31.971
Well. there's gotta be some
order to the universe.

521
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:38.107
Well. once I got my ego
to step aside.

522
00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:41.067
Hm. how'd your ego take it?

523
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.982
That should really be
my question.

524
00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.548
By all means.

525
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.202
As long as she answers.
I don't mind.

526
00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:48.335
It's all about getting
the words on the page.

527
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:50.946
By the way. my ego could
get used to this. ok.

528
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.210
She can't be fabulous
at everything. right?

529
00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:55.516
Isn't she humble?

530
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.170
Was she like this growing up?

531
00:29:00.651 --> 00:29:01.827
Go ahead.

532
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:03.567
Oh. my goodness!

533
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.918
She was the kid who had
her Barbies alphabetized.

534
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.746
Yeah. but didn't everybody?

535
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.922
And. as you can imagine.
they had quite a few outfits.

536
00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:12.402
Yeah. I only wish I had half
those outfits in real life.

537
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:14.013
Oh. I wanted those
sparkly boots.

538
00:29:14.187 --> 00:29:16.189
-Oh. yes. Good choice.
-Mm-hm.

539
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:19.540
My Aunt Mavis actually made
a lot of the clothes.

540
00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:21.585
That's kind of how I started.
you know?

541
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.196
I learned the whip stitch.
the ladder stitch.

542
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.154
the blanket stitch.

543
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:28.027
And you know what they say.
if you can sew Barbie clothes...

544
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.159
You can sew anything.

545
00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:36.296
How do you think she feels
about being back in Logenburgh?

546
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.341
I think happy. for now.

547
00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:41.867
The porch here certainly holds a
lot of memories for both of us.

548
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:45.914
That being said. her life
is still mostly in New York.

549
00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:48.090
Enough about me.

550
00:29:48.264 --> 00:29:51.224
About time. Now. where
for lunch?

551
00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:52.921
I think the question is

552
00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:56.490
what does baby Shastakovich
want for lunch?

553
00:29:56.664 --> 00:30:02.061
Possibly crepes with a side
of pickled red cabbage.

554
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:03.540
Oh. don't judge me it's...

555
00:30:03.714 --> 00:30:05.978
An interesting combo.

556
00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:07.240
He has an expense account.
right?

557
00:30:07.414 --> 00:30:08.676
Yeah. yeah.

558
00:30:10.112 --> 00:30:12.723
Actually. the per diem
really isn't that...

559
00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:16.815
I'll go get the keys.

560
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:34.615
Ok. I think I answered
all the questions.

561
00:30:38.227 --> 00:30:40.055
Hope you don't think I'm crazy.

562
00:31:00.293 --> 00:31:02.121
You're opening up.

563
00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:04.079
This is good.

564
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:29.975
Good morning. Christine.

565
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:32.020
Good morning yourself.
You're up early.

566
00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:33.804
I am.

567
00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:35.981
What's the deal with
this investment group offer?

568
00:31:36.155 --> 00:31:37.983
Oh. they're kicking the tires.

569
00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:40.028
Do we know who's behind
the money?

570
00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:42.465
Oh. a numbered company.

571
00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:44.903
Why?

572
00:31:45.077 --> 00:31:46.948
I just. it feels like something
Jean-Marc would do.

573
00:31:47.122 --> 00:31:49.211
I'll find out.

574
00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:52.954
Now. you and this new writer.
how are you getting on?

575
00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:55.957
Colin? Pretty great.

576
00:31:56.131 --> 00:31:58.046
I'm enjoying the hectic pace.

577
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.005
I'm loving being back
in Logenburgh.

578
00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:01.832
The spring and summer lines
are looking good

579
00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:03.269
and I think I'll have some new
patterns off to Salvatore

580
00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:04.270
by next week.

581
00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:05.880
Fantastic.

582
00:32:06.054 --> 00:32:07.882
Anything I can leak
on social media?

583
00:32:08.056 --> 00:32:10.537
Um. oh. I have some vintage
fabric I was gonna use.

584
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.060
I could post those.

585
00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:15.455
Whatever you're doing.
keep it up.

586
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:18.371
because Felicity is loving
the pages you're sending in.

587
00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:20.242
It's so good to get
some good news.

588
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:21.852
Yes. very positive.

589
00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:24.377
Now. tell me about
these vintage fabrics.

590
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:27.032
Ok. So. I have
this amazing idea.

591
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.084
Hm.

592
00:32:46.181 --> 00:32:47.356
Ready set?

593
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.054
You bet.

594
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.544
How's it going with Lisa?

595
00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:04.417
Actually. I'd say pretty good.

596
00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:05.984
I like her.

597
00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:07.159
I know you do.

598
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.987
She's pretty talented. hey?

599
00:33:09.161 --> 00:33:11.119
She's funny.
without even trying.

600
00:33:11.293 --> 00:33:13.469
So. what about your book.
Dad?

601
00:33:13.643 --> 00:33:15.123
Are you ever gonna finish it?

602
00:33:15.297 --> 00:33:16.907
Why?

603
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:19.040
I saw it open the other day.

604
00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:21.956
Why'd you stop?

605
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.350
Well. I had to find paid work

606
00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:26.613
in between taking care
of you and your mom.

607
00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:29.311
And then I got
pretty good at it.

608
00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:32.097
I am getting some pressure
to finish it now. though.

609
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.491
You wouldn't let me get away
with anything unfinished.

610
00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:36.971
Well. the reason why
you saw it open is

611
00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:38.494
because I have been working
on it.

612
00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:41.628
In between Lisa's.
and her memoir.

613
00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:44.022
she just has to approve
the changes I've made.

614
00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:46.981
A little bit more polishing
and then both will be done.

615
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:48.591
Well. that's good.

616
00:33:48.765 --> 00:33:50.115
I didn't want to take away
your screen time.

617
00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:54.467
See you after school.

618
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:04.433
So. an investment consortium
made an offer?

619
00:34:04.607 --> 00:34:06.479
They did.

620
00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:08.002
Won't they...

621
00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:09.177
License every
discount manufacturer

622
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:11.005
to pump out Lisa Holt designs

623
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.138
so that I become a bulk discount
bin designer?

624
00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:19.144
I know a thing or two
about discount bins.

625
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:28.196
Just trying to figure out
where the money's coming from.

626
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.025
Maybe. you should get
your mind off it

627
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.636
before you take someone's
eye out with that.

628
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:37.858
Is that just like a standard
dad line?

629
00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:40.948
It works surprisingly well.
most of the time.

630
00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:44.299
Now. Mavis had a bike.
didn't she?

631
00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:48.086
The one with the basket?

632
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.740
You know how to ride a bike.
right?

633
00:34:55.441 --> 00:34:58.922
So. are you really thinking
about selling your line?

634
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:01.490
I'm looking at the offer.

635
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:04.319
Sales are lagging. rumors
that my brand's getting dropped.

636
00:35:04.493 --> 00:35:08.845
and not exactly a lot of people
lining up to carry my line.

637
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:10.891
You're in a tough spot.

638
00:35:11.065 --> 00:35:13.546
Just trying to keep
my options open.

639
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.113
It's hard to give something up

640
00:35:15.287 --> 00:35:16.940
that you put your heart
and soul into.

641
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.030
Well. let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

642
00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:22.598
So. what about
your designs then?

643
00:35:22.772 --> 00:35:26.124
Well. I kind of got away from
the core design aesthetics

644
00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:28.561
that Aunty Mavis taught me.

645
00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:30.215
You know. in the beginning
I wanted to do these.

646
00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:31.912
like. big frilly dresses.

647
00:35:32.086 --> 00:35:35.089
That haute couture runway
style but...

648
00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:37.570
But?

649
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:42.009
It's not me.
Not anymore.

650
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:43.924
Well. it's not etched in stone.

651
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:46.231
You can morph into
whatever you like.

652
00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:47.971
Well. designers
get pigeon-holed.

653
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:50.017
You're this.
or you're that.

654
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:52.062
I just feel like I'm taking
a really big risk

655
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:54.674
with this new line.

656
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:58.112
I think you have the talent
to do whatever you want.

657
00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:05.075
So. what about you
and your work?

658
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.948
-My stuff?
-Yeah.

659
00:36:08.122 --> 00:36:10.298
Well. my comeback novel
has been painfully close

660
00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:12.082
to being finished
for a while now.

661
00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:13.519
Mm-hm.

662
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:16.826
And I haven't wanted to.
for some reason.

663
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.916
Julie. she used to give it
one last read.

664
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.223
Made it feel like it was
really done.

665
00:36:22.397 --> 00:36:23.790
A seal of approval?

666
00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:26.140
Yeah. A bit.

667
00:36:26.314 --> 00:36:28.273
She had a flair for finding
typos too.

668
00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:39.109
Oh. man. I haven't been
to school in so long.

669
00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:43.026
Hey. Lisa. Hey. Dad.

670
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.507
Well. nice to see you too. Kira.

671
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:49.207
You know. I think I have some
dresses that might fit.

672
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:52.471
Dad?

673
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:54.908
Well. I'm not gonna say no
after that.

674
00:36:55.082 --> 00:36:57.127
What about tonight?

675
00:36:57.302 --> 00:36:59.173
It is pizza night.

676
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:07.007
My first month in Paris
was lonely.

677
00:37:07.181 --> 00:37:10.880
I mean. it rained a lot.
I didn't know anybody.

678
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:13.970
I would just spend days
staring out of cafe windows.

679
00:37:14.144 --> 00:37:15.494
I mean. I came this close
to pulling the plug

680
00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:16.582
and coming back home.

681
00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:18.061
Why didn't you?

682
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.324
Well. because I knew
it wouldn't last.

683
00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:21.500
and thankfully it didn't.

684
00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.850
Oh. and then spring came
and in Paris.

685
00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:28.071
that might as well be the eighth
wonder of the world.

686
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:31.901
I. um. I got a job cutting
patterns for Chanel.

687
00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:34.904
made some life-long friends
and then after a couple of years

688
00:37:35.078 --> 00:37:39.257
of really grinding. I finally
got the chance to design.

689
00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:43.522
Are you writing all this.
'cause this is good stuff.

690
00:37:43.696 --> 00:37:45.132
All up here.

691
00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:49.136
She is definitely your daughter.

692
00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:52.357
Ok.

693
00:37:57.057 --> 00:38:01.061
Spare room has three dresses
on the bed.

694
00:38:01.235 --> 00:38:02.715
Why don't you go pick one.

695
00:38:02.889 --> 00:38:05.065
try it on and let me know
what you think. huh?

696
00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:06.240
Mirror's behind the door.

697
00:38:06.414 --> 00:38:07.807
Kira?

698
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:09.504
I'm gonna wash my hands first.
Sheesh.

699
00:38:14.248 --> 00:38:16.294
You are a really good dad.
Colin.

700
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:19.079
Because I taught her
to wash her hands?

701
00:38:19.253 --> 00:38:21.995
No. you guys have
a great rapport.

702
00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:23.823
Thank you.

703
00:38:23.997 --> 00:38:25.694
We worked at it.

704
00:38:25.868 --> 00:38:28.567
I mean. ideally I'd like to be
the moody writer type.

705
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:30.830
but Kira's a little ray
of sunshine.

706
00:38:31.004 --> 00:38:33.615
At least she was until recently.

707
00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:34.921
Well. instead of being
the moody writer.

708
00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:36.966
you've got a moody teen.

709
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.925
I was that teen.

710
00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:42.058
I mean. now and then.
she's still my little girl.

711
00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:44.234
Awe. not attitude.

712
00:38:50.284 --> 00:38:51.938
What do you think?

713
00:38:52.112 --> 00:38:54.157
You look so much like
your mother.

714
00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:01.817
I'm just gonna pin it.

715
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:03.776
Ok.

716
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.344
Ok. you need to stay still.

717
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:08.911
So great.

718
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:10.957
Here we go.

719
00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:14.917
Perfect. and I will just
get these a bit.

720
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:16.136
Yeah.

721
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.790
I'm totally in love with it.

722
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:19.835
I love hearing that.

723
00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:21.271
Ok. just gonna get a picture.

724
00:39:21.446 --> 00:39:23.273
Of course.

725
00:39:23.448 --> 00:39:24.927
All right. can you just throw
your shoulder back a little bit?

726
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:26.973
Yes. perfect.

727
00:39:30.672 --> 00:39:32.065
Ok. be careful taking it off.

728
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.588
Just make sure the pin
stays in place.

729
00:39:33.762 --> 00:39:35.111
Got it.

730
00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:39.986
It's so nice to see her
so excited.

731
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.988
Seeing a girl's face light up
with the perfect dress.

732
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:43.903
it's like the best
feeling ever.

733
00:39:44.077 --> 00:39:45.818
I think that if I ended up
just making prom dresses

734
00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:49.169
and doing alterations.
I'd be happy.

735
00:39:53.173 --> 00:39:57.003
So. an eyeshadow to match
the dress would be perfect.

736
00:39:57.177 --> 00:40:00.093
I think it's time
for the makeup talk.

737
00:40:02.312 --> 00:40:05.054
Oh. no. I'm not going there.

738
00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:15.674
Christine. What are you
doing here?

739
00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:20.853
They're dropping my line.
aren't they?

740
00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:22.463
They are.

741
00:40:22.637 --> 00:40:25.945
Lagging sales and lack of
big name panache.

742
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:28.295
They actually said "panache"?

743
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:29.905
Ok. did you find out

744
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.211
who's behind the investment
group offer?

745
00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:32.517
No.

746
00:40:35.258 --> 00:40:36.564
We gotta start working
the phones.

747
00:40:36.738 --> 00:40:39.045
Yeah. It's gonna be
a long night.

748
00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:41.221
I'll go make some coffee.

749
00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:57.063
Seeing strong female figures
in action is great for her.

750
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:05.550
Well. I guess that would make
me a role model. wouldn't it?

751
00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:10.076
Yes. it would.

752
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.905
Salvatore. how good
to finally talk to you.

753
00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.559
So. what are you trying
to do here?

754
00:41:14.733 --> 00:41:16.474
Um. well once our retail line
got dropped.

755
00:41:16.648 --> 00:41:18.606
we also lost our slot
at Salvatore's.

756
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.565
That's a contract manufacturer.
right?

757
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:22.567
Yeah. one of the best.

758
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:25.178
They can trace some of their
raw silks back to Marco Polo.

759
00:41:25.352 --> 00:41:27.180
We were really lucky to get in
with them

760
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:29.051
and we're just hoping he can
squeeze us in for a limited run

761
00:41:29.225 --> 00:41:31.445
between his big design
house orders.

762
00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:33.360
So. Christine's on the phone
with him now.

763
00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:37.582
so I can at least maybe have
a product available online.

764
00:41:37.756 --> 00:41:39.235
One moment.

765
00:41:40.236 --> 00:41:41.281
Salvatore.

766
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.652
Thursday?

767
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:08.047
Oh. you want the pieces
by next week?

768
00:42:14.488 --> 00:42:17.317
Ok. do you know
what we do next?

769
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:20.538
First proofs back. we have
a photoshoot right here.

770
00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:22.496
That way we can at least
get something online.

771
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.628
Livestream something.

772
00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:25.281
Yes. like a fashion event.

773
00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:26.979
Create some heat.

774
00:42:27.153 --> 00:42:28.676
Heat's good.

775
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.026
Yes. or else I'll have
a warehouse full of stuff

776
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.593
that I can't sell.

777
00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:33.638
You sure you can get
those designs done

778
00:42:33.812 --> 00:42:35.335
and those patterns cut?

779
00:42:35.509 --> 00:42:37.250
I have to. don't I?

780
00:42:38.817 --> 00:42:41.515
This is where I'd say
something like.

781
00:42:41.689 --> 00:42:45.954
you gotta cowboy up.

782
00:42:46.128 --> 00:42:49.305
I never thought I'd hear you say
"cowboy up".

783
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:51.046
I know.

784
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.965
Now. I smell pizza.
and darling. I'm starving.

785
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:58.358
Come on!

786
00:43:27.082 --> 00:43:28.954
<i>"She pieces together</i>
<i>strategic phone calls</i>

787
00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:30.956
<i>"in a hectic all-nighter.</i>

788
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.916
<i>"In the morning. her business.</i>
<i>her name.</i>

789
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.311
<i>"her brand is all still</i>
<i>in doubt.</i>

790
00:43:38.485 --> 00:43:42.968
<i>"but you wouldn't know it by</i>
<i>the quiet smile on her face.</i>

791
00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:45.057
<i>"She rattles off another</i>
<i>half dozen ideas.</i>

792
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:48.060
<i>"each with potential.</i>

793
00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:53.500
<i>"and you get the feeling</i>
<i>that she won't give up.</i>

794
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:07.688
Hm.

795
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.120
Oh.

796
00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:57.956
My baby's gonna wear
a Holt original?

797
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.000
Thank you.

798
00:44:59.174 --> 00:45:00.175
There's more.

799
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.483
Oh.

800
00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:07.661
I can't believe you did this

801
00:45:07.835 --> 00:45:09.271
with all that's going on
in your life.

802
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:12.144
Oh. well. you know me.
I like to keep busy.

803
00:45:15.103 --> 00:45:17.105
Oh. that's so you can do
the little footprints.

804
00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:20.152
It's a soy-based ink.
so it's ok for the baby.

805
00:45:23.633 --> 00:45:25.418
This is starting to get real.

806
00:45:25.592 --> 00:45:27.986
Real? You've got a little life
growing inside you.

807
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.902
I can hardly keep
a houseplant.

808
00:45:31.076 --> 00:45:32.512
What about Colin?

809
00:45:32.686 --> 00:45:35.602
He's probably better than
most houseplants.

810
00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:37.212
Why do married people

811
00:45:37.386 --> 00:45:38.997
always want their single
friends to hook up?

812
00:45:39.171 --> 00:45:40.215
Oh. it's a dinner party thing.

813
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:41.826
You know. just for numbers.

814
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.915
Unless it's a barbecue.

815
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:45.786
then there's a built-
in distraction for
the single person

816
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.179
so they don't stick out like
spinach between the teeth.

817
00:45:47.353 --> 00:45:49.877
Ok.

818
00:45:50.051 --> 00:45:53.968
But really. Colin
is a great guy.

819
00:45:54.142 --> 00:45:57.972
Handsome. wonderful father.
Easy to talk to. good listener.

820
00:45:58.146 --> 00:45:59.104
Successful.

821
00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:04.022
The guy ticks off
a lot of boxes. Lis.

822
00:46:04.196 --> 00:46:07.895
Yeah. well when you put it
like that.

823
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:12.378
I'm just. I don't know.
Not there right now.

824
00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:14.859
Just don't exclude
the possibility.

825
00:46:15.033 --> 00:46:17.383
For your pregnant bestie.

826
00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:19.037
Oh. you're playing the prego
card. huh?

827
00:46:19.211 --> 00:46:22.040
-Hm.
-Mm-hm.

828
00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:24.042
Yeah. I mean. there's definitely
been times

829
00:46:24.216 --> 00:46:27.915
where I think about what
I've missed. you know?

830
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.875
Nights in New York where I would
just sleep in my office.

831
00:46:31.049 --> 00:46:32.920
I have a futon couch. you know
to go with the whole...

832
00:46:33.094 --> 00:46:34.792
Feng shui thing.

833
00:46:34.966 --> 00:46:40.754
Yeah. But. I mean. it would be
nice to have someone.

834
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:45.890
Like my Dave.

835
00:46:46.064 --> 00:46:47.369
You're so in love still.

836
00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:48.588
Hello?

837
00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:50.982
Oh. come in.

838
00:46:51.156 --> 00:46:54.246
I'm both jealous and happy
for you at the same time.

839
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.943
-Hi.
-Hi.

840
00:46:56.117 --> 00:46:58.990
Hi. can I borrow my wife?
It's her last checkup.

841
00:46:59.164 --> 00:47:01.166
Pregnancy brain.
I totally forgot.

842
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.168
That's why I'm here. babe.

843
00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:05.213
Ok.

844
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:07.085
-Come on.
-Thanks.

845
00:47:08.782 --> 00:47:11.002
I thought I'd try to design
my own dress.

846
00:47:11.176 --> 00:47:13.004
Maybe Lisa would show me
how to make a pattern

847
00:47:13.178 --> 00:47:14.962
and then teach me how to sew.

848
00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:17.269
Well. I'd hate to put anything
more on her plate. Kira.

849
00:47:17.443 --> 00:47:19.793
She's got that
whole retail thing.

850
00:47:19.967 --> 00:47:22.100
Forgot about that.

851
00:47:22.274 --> 00:47:24.624
I'm sure she would afterwards.

852
00:47:28.628 --> 00:47:33.024
All right. What are you
working on?

853
00:47:33.198 --> 00:47:35.940
Periodic table. Specifically
the noble gases.

854
00:47:36.114 --> 00:47:37.593
How are these noble gases?

855
00:47:37.767 --> 00:47:40.031
I'd say the neon's
pretty bright.

856
00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:43.121
Wow. Look at you.
making bad dad jokes.

857
00:47:46.124 --> 00:47:47.125
Capitalize this word.

858
00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:49.040
Ok.

859
00:47:49.214 --> 00:47:51.433
Would I like Lisa's book?

860
00:47:51.607 --> 00:47:53.131
Ah. when you're older.

861
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:55.611
There's kissing.

862
00:47:55.785 --> 00:47:57.483
Dad. I'm 14

863
00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.920
and I'm gonna be dating in
the not so distant future.

864
00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:01.704
Ok. please stop.

865
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:05.404
You like her. don't you?

866
00:48:12.454 --> 00:48:13.803
Yeah.

867
00:48:13.978 --> 00:48:16.023
Yeah. I guess I do.

868
00:48:16.197 --> 00:48:19.331
I mean. beyond working
with her.

869
00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:23.291
It'd be ok if you did.

870
00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:32.866
You know. I think you're gonna
do great on this project.

871
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.868
I think I will too.

872
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:36.609
Ok. Time to get ready.

873
00:48:36.783 --> 00:48:40.134
I'll let Stephanie know
that we're on our way.

874
00:48:40.308 --> 00:48:42.397
When will we see Lisa again?

875
00:48:42.571 --> 00:48:44.138
I'm not sure.

876
00:48:44.312 --> 00:48:48.055
She's great. and I love
her taste in perfume.

877
00:48:48.229 --> 00:48:51.015
Well. I hadn't noticed.

878
00:48:53.539 --> 00:48:55.280
What do you think?

879
00:48:55.454 --> 00:49:00.546
I think that noble gases
have never been more noble.

880
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.071
That's what I was going for.

881
00:49:04.245 --> 00:49:06.073
You forget something?

882
00:50:10.355 --> 00:50:12.922
So. do you always spend this
much time with your subjects?

883
00:50:13.097 --> 00:50:14.098
Not always. but
you're not so bad.

884
00:50:14.272 --> 00:50:16.230
so it's not a grind.

885
00:50:16.404 --> 00:50:18.145
I've really enjoyed the journey
so far.

886
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:25.283
Bahn-Franc is interested
in taking my line.

887
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:27.024
They want to meet.

888
00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:28.590
Bahn-Franc? That's
a high-end store.

889
00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:29.635
Yeah.

890
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.942
That's a good thing. right?

891
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:34.161
I'm not sure.

892
00:50:34.335 --> 00:50:35.771
I mean. if they want to meet.

893
00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:37.382
they're gonna have to come
to Logenburgh.

894
00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:38.861
because with my luck.
I'll fly to New York

895
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.472
and then Meena
will have the baby.

896
00:50:40.646 --> 00:50:41.647
And the rest of the patterns
to Salvatore?

897
00:50:41.821 --> 00:50:43.301
Got them off the other day.

898
00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:44.519
Now. I just have to sign off
on the memoir

899
00:50:44.693 --> 00:50:45.955
and do the photoshoot.

900
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.566
Ah. I've already talked to

901
00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.349
half a dozen of Julie's
old colleagues.

902
00:50:48.523 --> 00:50:50.134
Thank you.

903
00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:52.136
Oh. and Meena has a cousin
who's a brand influencer.

904
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.963
She got her to come. so I think
I have all my bases covered.

905
00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:55.487
That's great.

906
00:50:56.705 --> 00:50:58.055
And the memoir.

907
00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:00.144
How are you feeling about it?

908
00:51:00.318 --> 00:51:04.452
I... I actually like
the changes you made.

909
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:06.846
I think that I'm gonna leave it
in your hands.

910
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.023
So. when you think it's ready.
submit.

911
00:51:12.982 --> 00:51:14.027
Thank you.

912
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:15.855
I know that's a lot of trust.

913
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:17.813
I just have a couple sections
to look over

914
00:51:17.987 --> 00:51:20.903
and I think it's ready.

915
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.515
I don't know how to end it.
though.

916
00:51:23.689 --> 00:51:25.125
I think there's more there.

917
00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:27.301
To my story?

918
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:29.173
-Mm.
-Hm.

919
00:51:29.738 --> 00:51:33.351
I guess I'm just holding out
for a happy ending.

920
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:41.272
I have a line on something
interesting.

921
00:51:41.446 --> 00:51:44.057
I thought you might want
to check out.

922
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.495
Come on.

923
00:51:54.198 --> 00:51:56.374
So. how do you know this guy?

924
00:51:56.548 --> 00:51:58.115
College roommate.

925
00:51:59.986 --> 00:52:01.683
Were you the clean one?

926
00:52:02.206 --> 00:52:03.555
No.

927
00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:13.391
How?

928
00:52:13.565 --> 00:52:14.957
It's an old prop house.

929
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.611
They're selling everything
for rags.

930
00:52:16.785 --> 00:52:17.917
so I thought it would be worth
to go through.

931
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:20.137
I mean. for someone like you.

932
00:52:23.052 --> 00:52:25.054
You did great. Colin.

933
00:52:25.229 --> 00:52:27.056
Thanks.

934
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:41.375
Hm?

935
00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:45.988
Yes. but the fabric.
that's the key.

936
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:48.904
I can maybe make a one-off
for the photoshoot.

937
00:52:49.078 --> 00:52:50.906
You got a lot on your plate.
huh?

938
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.081
Yeah.

939
00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:54.127
Ooh.

940
00:52:59.088 --> 00:53:00.002
Oh.

941
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.961
What do you think?

942
00:53:02.527 --> 00:53:04.137
For Halloween?

943
00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:10.099
Huh?

944
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:12.014
Come on.

945
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:14.887
That's not bad. actually.

946
00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:17.106
Ok. My turn.

947
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:20.431
So. when do you need to hear
back from Bahn-Franc?

948
00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:21.562
Pretty quickly.

949
00:54:21.736 --> 00:54:23.303
They want me for the fall.

950
00:54:23.477 --> 00:54:24.870
but just so in love with
my new retro inspired line

951
00:54:25.044 --> 00:54:27.046
and I don't know if
it'll fly with them.

952
00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.091
I'm calling it
Retro Functionality.

953
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.963
And I know that's just
a made-up term.

954
00:54:31.137 --> 00:54:32.878
but it's funky.
it's confident.

955
00:54:33.052 --> 00:54:35.402
It's kind of an homage
to my Aunty Mavis.

956
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:38.362
A very stylish.
yet practical woman.

957
00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:41.887
I like it already.

958
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:45.020
Oh. um. you said we could
fill up your trunk. right?

959
00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:50.591
Yes. if you enlighten me on this
new retro functionality concept.

960
00:54:50.765 --> 00:54:54.552
Ok. so. a woman buys two of
my vintage inspired outfits

961
00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.249
and she now has multiple
combinations

962
00:54:56.423 --> 00:54:58.904
because all of the colors
are complimentary

963
00:54:59.078 --> 00:55:00.471
and all the accessories.
everything.

964
00:55:00.645 --> 00:55:02.473
Everything can be combined.

965
00:55:02.647 --> 00:55:05.258
It's kind of how I started
at the beginning and.

966
00:55:05.432 --> 00:55:08.130
I don't know. I think
it could be huge.

967
00:55:12.134 --> 00:55:14.180
I want to thank you for this.

968
00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:18.837
I should be thanking you.

969
00:55:19.011 --> 00:55:20.404
I haven't had this much fun
in a while.

970
00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:22.449
I mean. I've had dad fun.

971
00:55:22.623 --> 00:55:25.931
but Colin fun's kind of been
in short supply.

972
00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.411
Well. I'm happy to hear that.

973
00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:33.460
Everything ok?

974
00:55:33.634 --> 00:55:35.636
Mm-hm.

975
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.422
You know. why don't I take this
out to the truck?

976
00:55:38.596 --> 00:55:40.206
Thank you.

977
00:55:52.087 --> 00:55:53.437
Thank you.

978
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:59.181
Hey. stranger.

979
00:56:01.575 --> 00:56:05.144
Fee! What are you doing here?

980
00:56:05.318 --> 00:56:08.408
Thought I'd pop around
and see how things are going.

981
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:10.149
Lionel?

982
00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:13.457
In that case. I have some
good news.

983
00:56:13.631 --> 00:56:15.110
I'm listening.

984
00:56:15.284 --> 00:56:18.549
I have decided to hold off.
there's more.

985
00:56:18.723 --> 00:56:20.202
That last draft felt ready.

986
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:21.943
Just trust me.

987
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:23.597
Ok.

988
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:27.079
The work feels personal.

989
00:56:27.253 --> 00:56:29.777
The most personal
it's been since...

990
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:31.388
I know.

991
00:56:31.562 --> 00:56:34.303
You like her. It shows
in the writing.

992
00:56:34.478 --> 00:56:35.827
That's a good thing. right?

993
00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:37.698
On both counts.

994
00:56:37.872 --> 00:56:40.005
Have you ever thought about.
can I get one of those?

995
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:41.267
-Uh-huh.
-Thanks.

996
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:43.443
Yeah. put it on his tab.

997
00:56:44.183 --> 00:56:47.186
Yes. I have thought about it.

998
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.231
What's not to like about
Lisa Holt?

999
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.625
She's funny. pretty. smart.

1000
00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:54.585
Can't be in a bad mood
around her.

1001
00:56:54.759 --> 00:56:56.064
But...

1002
00:56:56.238 --> 00:56:58.023
It's ok to put yourself
out there.

1003
00:56:58.197 --> 00:57:00.112
You don't have to shut down
and build an emotional fortress.

1004
00:57:00.286 --> 00:57:02.941
Can my emotional fortress
be made out of Lego?

1005
00:57:03.115 --> 00:57:05.030
Be serious.

1006
00:57:05.204 --> 00:57:10.035
Fee. I've had a lot of serious.
Just. haven't been ready.

1007
00:57:10.209 --> 00:57:11.950
Kira's in this too.

1008
00:57:12.124 --> 00:57:13.342
I don't know how those
two things are gonna mesh.

1009
00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:16.128
I get that. completely.

1010
00:57:16.302 --> 00:57:18.957
Maybe when Kira's older.

1011
00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:20.959
Colin. you can't
just close up shop

1012
00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:22.482
and reopen five years later.

1013
00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:24.876
You'll be stale
and out of date.

1014
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.226
So now I'm day-old bread?

1015
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.010
Now. what about your manuscript?

1016
00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:29.881
What about it?

1017
00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:31.796
Colin. seriously.

1018
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.972
What do you say. I get two gems
to Lionel in one calendar year

1019
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:36.061
and he gives me
a big fat raise.

1020
00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:37.889
Well deserved. I may add.

1021
00:57:38.063 --> 00:57:39.673
Be a win-win.

1022
00:57:39.847 --> 00:57:41.632
You know what would be the heat
from Lisa's bio

1023
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:45.374
linked to your own work but
you've got to finish it first.

1024
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:47.942
Why don't we just go make
some copies?

1025
00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:49.857
You've done it?

1026
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:51.076
You!

1027
00:57:52.425 --> 00:57:54.079
I thought about it
for a while now.

1028
00:57:54.253 --> 00:57:56.081
Finally got it done.

1029
00:57:56.255 --> 00:57:58.518
It felt like it was
the right time.

1030
00:57:58.692 --> 00:58:00.477
I can't wait.

1031
00:58:05.743 --> 00:58:07.092
Some of the stuff
he's written about me.

1032
00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:08.920
I mean. it's like he sees
the real me.

1033
00:58:09.094 --> 00:58:10.269
I mean. with everything
else that's been going on.

1034
00:58:10.443 --> 00:58:11.792
he's been a rock.

1035
00:58:11.966 --> 00:58:12.967
Well. I like what
you let me read.

1036
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:14.926
Timing couldn't be better.

1037
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.928
Introduce your new clothing line
on the heels of the best seller.

1038
00:58:17.102 --> 00:58:19.844
And I got the top event planner
in the city

1039
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:21.498
for our little fashion shoot.

1040
00:58:21.672 --> 00:58:23.369
It's moving forward
and my cousin is going

1041
00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:24.892
to Tweet and hoot and whatever
the kids do these days.

1042
00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:26.938
What?

1043
00:58:27.112 --> 00:58:28.330
It's just Jean-Marc.

1044
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.028
He's bugging me to meet
with him.

1045
00:58:30.202 --> 00:58:30.985
Don't do it. The guy's like
French kryptonite.

1046
00:58:31.159 --> 00:58:32.465
Les kryptonite.

1047
00:58:35.033 --> 00:58:36.643
Bahn-Franc isn't coming
to Logenburgh.

1048
00:58:36.817 --> 00:58:38.515
It's a take it or leave it
proposition

1049
00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:40.560
and they request an answer.

1050
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:50.178
You know. I've been sitting back
waiting for things to happen

1051
00:58:50.352 --> 00:58:52.006
instead of making things happen.

1052
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.269
It's time I took back
some control.

1053
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:55.488
Are you sure?

1054
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:57.055
Yes.

1055
00:58:57.229 --> 00:58:58.622
My Aunt Mavis used to say.
bet on yourself.

1056
00:58:58.796 --> 00:59:00.972
So I'm gonna do just that
and bet on me.

1057
00:59:01.146 --> 00:59:02.800
And I'll reiterate to Bahn-Franc

1058
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:04.453
that this isn't a negotiating
ploy.

1059
00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:08.806
but a stylistic commitment
to your vision.

1060
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.894
We're doing this?

1061
00:59:10.068 --> 00:59:11.199
Yes.

1062
00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:14.507
Hey. maybe this is just the
happy ending my memoir needed?

1063
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:16.204
Spunky heroine...

1064
00:59:16.378 --> 00:59:18.032
-With a heart of gold.
-With a heart of gold.

1065
00:59:18.206 --> 00:59:19.468
Successfully launches
her boutique fashion brand.

1066
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:21.732
And lives happily ever after.

1067
00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:23.342
It's all coming together.

1068
00:59:23.516 --> 00:59:25.039
They're holding up
your memoir's release.

1069
00:59:25.213 --> 00:59:26.388
Someone at Bahn-Franc
or the investment group

1070
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:29.043
knows someone
at the publisher.

1071
00:59:29.217 --> 00:59:32.177
They're using this
as leverage.

1072
00:59:32.351 --> 00:59:35.136
This isn't leverage.
This is Jean-Marc.

1073
00:59:36.094 --> 00:59:38.357
See? Les Kryptonite.

1074
00:59:46.713 --> 00:59:51.022
Thank you for this.
It's good to keep busy.

1075
00:59:51.196 --> 00:59:53.198
I'm glad you liked the memoir.

1076
00:59:53.372 --> 00:59:55.156
I know some of it couldn't have
been easy.

1077
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:59.857
Yeah. reliving the bad bits
was not a great experience.

1078
01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:02.076
Without saying too much.

1079
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.949
you got the whole Jean-Marc
situation down

1080
01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:08.387
in excruciating detail.

1081
01:00:08.561 --> 01:00:10.519
Yeah. there was a lot
in the tabloids.

1082
01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:19.267
I want to thank you for giving
it the life that it needed.

1083
01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:21.269
I'm sorry that they're
holding up the release.

1084
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:22.575
Yeah. not exactly
the happy ending

1085
01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:25.056
we were hoping for. is it?

1086
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.931
I've really enjoyed
my time with you.

1087
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:34.413
Writing can be kind of solitary
and bouncing ideas off you.

1088
01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.415
never knowing
what I'm gonna get.

1089
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:38.460
Well. if anything.
I'm entertaining. right?

1090
01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.075
That you are.

1091
01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:46.555
I really enjoyed the change.
too.

1092
01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:01.048
So. um. I guess this means
we're kind of almost done

1093
01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:03.355
with our collaboration?

1094
01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:08.012
Oh. I hadn't really thought
about it.

1095
01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.579
Well. I'll see you around town?

1096
01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:12.930
It's not over until
we find an ending.

1097
01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:15.628
Felicity strongly agrees.

1098
01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:19.588
Ambiguity. never good
for an ending.

1099
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:25.072
So. I guess we'll just let it
play out. right?

1100
01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:26.160
Yeah.

1101
01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:28.119
We should.

1102
01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:30.077
For the book.

1103
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:32.210
Of course.

1104
01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:44.657
I. um. I was hoping you and Kira
could come to the shoot.

1105
01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:48.008
They'll be hors d'oeuvres
and appetizers and stuff.

1106
01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:49.488
And we get to catch
the unveiling

1107
01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:51.490
of the Holt Retro
Functionality line.

1108
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:55.015
Man. I am really shooting up
the dad ranks.

1109
01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.103
Thank you.

1110
01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:01.848
I was thinking that maybe
we could celebrate

1111
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:05.547
the small victory of nearly
being done

1112
01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.203
by maybe grabbing a bite
to eat tonight?

1113
01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:12.293
I'd like that.

1114
01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:17.995
Ok.

1115
01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:20.998
Ok. great.

1116
01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:22.477
Ok. I'm gonna.
I'm gonna get back.

1117
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.914
Yes.

1118
01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:25.480
Cool.

1119
01:03:14.138 --> 01:03:15.966
Feels so good to be
out of the house.

1120
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.619
I feel like I can't relax
at home.

1121
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.056
you know. when I have
all this unused fabric

1122
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.884
just sitting on
the cutting table.

1123
01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:22.755
It's like I just want to make
something out of it.

1124
01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:25.410
I love those times when
I'm writing and I can't stop.

1125
01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:28.543
And the words flow
and you just go.

1126
01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:31.068
Mmmhmm. yeah.

1127
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:36.595
Ok. so. if I was writing
the biography of Colin.

1128
01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:37.770
Mmmhmm.

1129
01:03:39.076 --> 01:03:40.251
Middle name?

1130
01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:41.556
Walter.

1131
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:45.473
Colin Walter Davenport. Ok.

1132
01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:50.217
What's something the folks
at home should know?

1133
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.611
Notoriously unhandy.

1134
01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:55.135
I'm definitely not your fix
your faucet kind of guy.

1135
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:56.658
Really?

1136
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.573
I once nailed my sleeve
to a fence.

1137
01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:02.926
I can't believe I didn't get
caught up in the patio lights.

1138
01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:10.542
And I keep my ties tied.

1139
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:12.544
What. so you can just
slip them on over your head?

1140
01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:15.112
Yeah. I never learned.

1141
01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:19.768
I guess it kept me from being
a lawyer or an accountant.

1142
01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:27.994
So. I haven't done this
in a while.

1143
01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:30.997
Me neither.

1144
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:36.307
But I can definitely see myself
doing more of this.

1145
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:40.964
You know. when things
settle down a little.

1146
01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:43.009
Me too.

1147
01:04:49.102 --> 01:04:50.103
That was really nice.

1148
01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:52.149
-Yeah. it was.
-Yeah.

1149
01:04:53.193 --> 01:04:54.455
Oh.

1150
01:04:56.762 --> 01:05:00.592
Caviar. aged cheddar. champagne?

1151
01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:11.995
Woah. They are serious.

1152
01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:13.822
Who?

1153
01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.912
The investment group.

1154
01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:17.870
Is it a good offer?

1155
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:20.133
It's a great offer.

1156
01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:25.008
It's got a five year
non-compete.

1157
01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:28.359
It means I either start
from scratch

1158
01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:31.014
or behind door number two.

1159
01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:32.406
I let Bahn-Franc
dictate my style

1160
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.235
and where I fit
into their brand.

1161
01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:39.326
Or. door number three. you
could set up shop for yourself.

1162
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.937
Yeah. that's scary.

1163
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.373
I mean. I'm not sure
if the grind

1164
01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.505
is gonna be worth that
in the long run.

1165
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:45.942
Ah. it's about the process.

1166
01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:47.595
The journey.

1167
01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:50.990
It's not all about the big check
in your hand.

1168
01:05:51.164 --> 01:05:52.252
It's a five year non-compete.

1169
01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:55.908
I mean. I could come back.

1170
01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:58.041
Creativity doesn't work
like that.

1171
01:05:58.215 --> 01:06:00.478
Can't just turn it on and off.

1172
01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:04.830
Well. we're different people.
Colin.

1173
01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:06.701
What's that supposed to mean?

1174
01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.225
You stopped creating your
own work to fix other people's.

1175
01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:09.443
I mean. you're very good at it.
but...

1176
01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.445
What about the fashion shoot?

1177
01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:15.884
Salvatore squeezing you in. it
just feels like you're quitting.

1178
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.843
Ok. you know what.

1179
01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.237
you come talk to me when
you put yourself out there.

1180
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:22.108
Maybe if you finally submit
your manuscript

1181
01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:25.372
you'll know how this feels.

1182
01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.984
I'm sorry.

1183
01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:30.421
I finished my manuscript.

1184
01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:32.597
A few days ago.

1185
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:35.600
Just waiting for
the right moment.

1186
01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:38.559
Would have meant a lot to me
for you to read it.

1187
01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:42.433
Colin...

1188
01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:47.498
Really?

1189
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.517
Colin?

1190
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:11.174
Hello.

1191
01:08:11.348 --> 01:08:13.480
What are you doing here?

1192
01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:17.354
It's good to see you. Lisa.
Can I come in?

1193
01:08:17.528 --> 01:08:19.138
It's very early.

1194
01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:21.967
You would never get back
to sleep and I'm jet-lagged.

1195
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:24.012
Let us make the best of it.

1196
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:27.015
I don't think so.

1197
01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:31.019
Did you like the gift basket?

1198
01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:34.414
Champagne. caviar.
probably an aged cheddar.

1199
01:08:34.588 --> 01:08:36.634
How...

1200
01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:38.897
My family trust is
heavily involved with
the investment group

1201
01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:43.075
and as of last week.
we also own Bahn-Franc.

1202
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:44.903
We make the announcement
at the end of the month.

1203
01:08:45.077 --> 01:08:48.124
so can we talk?

1204
01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.391
You get my memoir back on track
or I'm gonna leave you

1205
01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:57.568
out on the porch until February.
for all I'm concerned.

1206
01:08:57.742 --> 01:09:00.571
I had to delay things
until I read an advanced copy.

1207
01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:04.314
Wait. wait you. you blocked it
because you hadn't read it yet?

1208
01:09:04.488 --> 01:09:05.793
Yeah.

1209
01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:11.886
Argh! That is so. so you.

1210
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.410
Hm.

1211
01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:18.241
So. what did you think?

1212
01:09:18.415 --> 01:09:22.245
I come off as a playful cat
so I have no issues with it.

1213
01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.856
We needed to see if it...

1214
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.293
Affects your brand?

1215
01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:28.903
You probably only read the parts
you were in.

1216
01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:30.383
Yeah.

1217
01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:31.776
Fix it.

1218
01:09:34.474 --> 01:09:36.476
Fix it!

1219
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.783
Two texts. tops.

1220
01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.698
Then do it.

1221
01:09:41.525 --> 01:09:42.700
Ok.

1222
01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:03.155
You look... good.

1223
01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:11.990
So. are you here as a Bahn-Franc
representative

1224
01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.948
or are you just here
to make sure

1225
01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:16.951
that the investment group's gift
basket got here on time?

1226
01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.307
Really. Jean-Marc.

1227
01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:26.178
What are you doing here?

1228
01:10:28.876 --> 01:10:33.185
First. I must apologize to you
for having been a...

1229
01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:37.450
For not respecting you.

1230
01:10:40.105 --> 01:10:43.369
Water under the bridge.

1231
01:10:43.543 --> 01:10:48.331
There's someone else.
isn't there?

1232
01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.028
Maybe.

1233
01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:52.160
I don't know.

1234
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.728
Kind of left off on bad terms.

1235
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:58.210
Hm.

1236
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.188
<i>Voicemail: Hey.</i>
<i>you've reached Colin.</i>

1237
01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:21.886
<i>I'm not able to take your call</i>
<i>right now.</i>

1238
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.541
<i>but I'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

1239
01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:25.716
Hi Colin.

1240
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.632
Um. I. uh. I just wanted to say

1241
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:32.375
I'm sorry for how things ended
the other night.

1242
01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:34.246
I. um. I guess I was just upset

1243
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.335
with everything that happened.
and...

1244
01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:43.951
Yeah. I. as a fellow creative. I
know how hard it is and really.

1245
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:47.912
I just. I miss talking to you
and bouncing ideas off you

1246
01:11:48.086 --> 01:11:53.918
and I mean. we still don't have
an ending to our story. right?

1247
01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:58.401
Anyhoo. I was hoping that Kira
could model the dress

1248
01:11:58.575 --> 01:11:59.837
I made for her.

1249
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:01.969
If that's ok with you.
of course.

1250
01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:04.537
So. anyway. I was just calling
to say. I...

1251
01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.150
I'm sorry.

1252
01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:20.814
<i>Voicemail: First new message.</i>

1253
01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:23.077
<i>Hi Colin. I just wanted</i>
<i>to say...</i>

1254
01:12:26.603 --> 01:12:28.082
<i>TV: ...the forecast cloudy</i>
<i>and windy today</i>

1255
01:12:28.256 --> 01:12:30.824
<i>with gusts up to 40</i>

1256
01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:34.741
<i>TV: Ok. Jack. let's have</i>
<i>our next contestant....</i>

1257
01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:38.832
I'll call you back.

1258
01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:42.140
You know. you'd make me turn off
the television for doing that.

1259
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:52.585
You're coming with me.
aren't you?

1260
01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.588
Yes.

1261
01:12:55.762 --> 01:12:57.285
And you're gonna wear your
nice suit?

1262
01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.939
The one Mom made you buy.

1263
01:12:59.113 --> 01:12:59.984
Yes.

1264
01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:02.856
And you're gonna shower?

1265
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:09.210
Kira. I am gonna bathe and I am
gonna dress appropriately.

1266
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.648
I'm wearing a Holt original.
It's a big deal.

1267
01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:16.479
And you've kind of been hit
or miss these last couple days.

1268
01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:18.916
I know.

1269
01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:24.051
I'll be in good form.
I promise.

1270
01:13:24.225 --> 01:13:26.924
Let's get photos with the
technology made this century.

1271
01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.055
One.

1272
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:29.709
I get one Polaroid.

1273
01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:32.538
and I will be Mr. Digital
Photography Man. ok?

1274
01:13:32.712 --> 01:13:33.670
Ok.

1275
01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.024
You should talk to her
before then.

1276
01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:44.158
Dad. don't just leave
it hanging.

1277
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:51.514
You're wise beyond your years.
Kira.

1278
01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:53.211
Get it from Mom.

1279
01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:55.822
Yes. you do.

1280
01:13:57.737 --> 01:13:58.695
Ok.

1281
01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:02.481
I don't know. Meena.

1282
01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:04.440
I mean. Jean-Marc's offer
is really good

1283
01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:07.834
and Colin's not returning
my calls.

1284
01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:10.271
Ok. ask yourself this.

1285
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.536
What's your life gonna be like
if you sign with him?

1286
01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:15.581
And is it gonna be worth it?

1287
01:14:15.755 --> 01:14:18.236
I mean. would you ever have time
to be doing this kind of thing?

1288
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.630
Sitting on the front porch
with your bestie?

1289
01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:23.937
You can smell the cherry
blossoms from down the street.

1290
01:14:24.111 --> 01:14:27.419
Or. do you like sleeping on that
futon thing in your office?

1291
01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:28.899
No. I don't.

1292
01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.860
That's some really good advice.

1293
01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:35.209
Mm. I'm gonna be a mom.

1294
01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:36.733
Mm.

1295
01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:39.257
I gotta start coming up
with this stuff.

1296
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.607
You know. if I want to put big
gold buttons on a winter coat.

1297
01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:44.915
I don't want marketing
to tell me that I can't.

1298
01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:47.047
What about Colin?

1299
01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:48.179
I don't know.

1300
01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:49.397
You should talk to him.

1301
01:14:49.572 --> 01:14:51.399
I know. I know.

1302
01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:52.879
I invited him to the shoot.

1303
01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:56.448
Oh! Which is gonna be awesome.

1304
01:14:56.622 --> 01:15:01.888
I just. I feel like I've shared
so much of my life with Colin.

1305
01:15:02.062 --> 01:15:03.890
And seeing Jean-Marc again
made me realize

1306
01:15:04.064 --> 01:15:08.373
that we weren't good for each
other even back then.

1307
01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.984
I think you should totally
give him a chance.

1308
01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:15.815
The way he looks at you.
oh. what do you have to lose?

1309
01:15:15.989 --> 01:15:17.469
Ok. I will give him a chance...

1310
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:18.949
Oh. I think it was
a contraction.

1311
01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:19.645
Oh.

1312
01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:21.125
Um.

1313
01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:22.779
You. you can't have
the baby now.

1314
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:24.302
I mean you haven't had
the baby shower yet.

1315
01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:25.608
Oh. I think the baby wants
to be there too.

1316
01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:26.913
-Oh. oh. no.
-No. that's ok.

1317
01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.175
Um. what do we?

1318
01:15:28.349 --> 01:15:29.655
-Ok. it's coming.
-It's ok.

1319
01:15:29.829 --> 01:15:31.265
Oh no. I'm gonna miss
your shoot!

1320
01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.789
No...

1321
01:15:32.963 --> 01:15:33.485
Listen. Lisa. I wanted
to tell you...

1322
01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:34.617
Um....

1323
01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:37.141
Hospital?

1324
01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:38.316
Yes.

1325
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:39.099
-Hospital!
-Yes.

1326
01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:40.187
Ok. It's ok.

1327
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:40.971
You'll. you'll... Ok.

1328
01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.712
I got ya.

1329
01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:43.930
I'm gonna go get my purse.
I'll be right back.

1330
01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:45.062
-We'll take my car.
-Ok.

1331
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:48.108
-Ok. You are going to be good.
-Ok.

1332
01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:07.345
Good morning.

1333
01:16:07.519 --> 01:16:09.303
Good morning to you.

1334
01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:15.440
It was quite the night. huh?

1335
01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:18.922
Yeah. kind of makes you realize
what's important in life.

1336
01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:20.184
Yeah. it does.

1337
01:16:20.358 --> 01:16:21.968
How're you feeling?

1338
01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:25.972
Honestly? Like a grapefruit
that's been juiced.

1339
01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:27.757
Ah. yes.

1340
01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:30.107
It was an amazing experience
and I need coffee.

1341
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.848
Take a shower.
big day ahead of us.

1342
01:16:32.022 --> 01:16:33.501
Photographers are en route.

1343
01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:35.025
catering is setting up
throughout the day.

1344
01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:36.853
We just need you fit
and fabulous.

1345
01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:38.245
Ok.

1346
01:16:38.419 --> 01:16:39.943
Um. my parents.
who's gonna...

1347
01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:42.032
I've got a car picking them up
at the airport.

1348
01:16:42.206 --> 01:16:43.033
Of course you do.

1349
01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:44.687
Thank you.

1350
01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.516
Ok.

1351
01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:49.387
Whatever you're feeling
right now.

1352
01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:50.431
put a sock in it.

1353
01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:51.607
It waits until later.

1354
01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:53.391
This is my girl's time to shine.

1355
01:16:53.565 --> 01:16:55.959
Respect the timing and
her current circumstances.

1356
01:16:56.133 --> 01:16:58.004
She's gotta be on her game
and we're here to help

1357
01:16:58.178 --> 01:16:59.005
in whatever way necessary.

1358
01:16:59.179 --> 01:17:00.267
Is that understood?

1359
01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:01.312
Uh...

1360
01:17:02.487 --> 01:17:04.184
She could have done a lot worse.

1361
01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:05.795
Thanks.

1362
01:17:05.969 --> 01:17:07.666
-Do you think that she...
-Eh...

1363
01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:12.105
Let's just be in the now.
shall we?

1364
01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:15.065
Let's go.

1365
01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:44.964
Thank you so much.

1366
01:17:45.138 --> 01:17:46.749
Of course.

1367
01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:47.967
Ok. now go try it on
and I'll be there in a sec.

1368
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.229
Thank you.

1369
01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.103
Well. you just made her year.

1370
01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:58.935
Wow.

1371
01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:00.937
That's a nice suit.

1372
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:05.028
And. might I say. Mr. Davenport.
you wear it well.

1373
01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:07.900
Thank you.

1374
01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:09.902
Haven't worn it in a while.

1375
01:18:10.076 --> 01:18:12.035
Thought I'd step up my game.

1376
01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.167
Well. I hope you let me
read your book

1377
01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:16.517
in the not too distant future.

1378
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.824
I'll have to make
some revisions.

1379
01:18:18.998 --> 01:18:21.131
Turns out I'm not
the same person I was.

1380
01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:23.220
and my work should
reflect that.

1381
01:18:23.394 --> 01:18:25.352
And be the richer for it.

1382
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:30.270
Well. let me know.

1383
01:18:30.444 --> 01:18:34.927
I'm gonna go check on Kira
and then off I go.

1384
01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:36.929
Good luck.

1385
01:18:37.103 --> 01:18:39.105
Hey. I just wanted to say how...

1386
01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:41.891
Uh. my family vintage.

1387
01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:44.894
I thought it would be
a nice touch.

1388
01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:46.460
Can you go get the other case
of champagne

1389
01:18:46.634 --> 01:18:48.419
in the trunk. please?

1390
01:18:49.072 --> 01:18:49.855
Sure.

1391
01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:51.335
No problem.

1392
01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.906
Love what you're wearing.
by the way.

1393
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.169
I hope it's part of the show.

1394
01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:18.057
Hello everybody.

1395
01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:23.889
Thank you all for making
the trek out to Logenburgh.

1396
01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:25.412
It allowed me to be there
for the birth

1397
01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:27.850
of my best friend's baby girl.
Sophie.

1398
01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:29.373
She is beautiful.

1399
01:19:29.547 --> 01:19:31.331
Mother and daughter
are doing great

1400
01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:34.857
and it was an incredible
experience. so thank you.

1401
01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:42.429
Now. for the new Holt line.
spring and summer.

1402
01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:45.128
It is an homage to
my Great Aunt Mavis.

1403
01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:48.000
a woman who made changes
for the better.

1404
01:19:48.174 --> 01:19:50.611
yet never lost her sense
of style.

1405
01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.397
So. it's retro chic
yet eminently adaptable.

1406
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:55.355
for the modern-day woman.

1407
01:19:58.576 --> 01:20:00.143
Classic styling
and feminine fit

1408
01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:02.841
that is flattering
for all shapes and sizes.

1409
01:20:11.197 --> 01:20:14.287
And. now for the best part.

1410
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:18.335
Everything matches. so if
you have two Holt outfits.

1411
01:20:18.509 --> 01:20:20.903
you actually have
many combinations.

1412
01:20:24.732 --> 01:20:25.777
<i>Lisa: Thank you.</i>

1413
01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:30.477
And. if you have a white blouse.
which I hope we all do.

1414
01:20:30.651 --> 01:20:33.263
then you have even
more combinations.

1415
01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:51.977
As you can see.

1416
01:20:52.151 --> 01:20:53.631
I have branched out
in this line

1417
01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:58.375
to include the fashionable
young miss.

1418
01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:00.333
Again. everything
is complementary

1419
01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:02.031
with the woman's line.

1420
01:21:02.205 --> 01:21:04.947
So. mother and daughter
can both wear them.

1421
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:15.348
So. now for our nouveau
chic wear.

1422
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.399
Are you going to be ok
for a minute?

1423
01:21:22.573 --> 01:21:23.530
-Yeah.
-Ok.

1424
01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.231
I love the line.

1425
01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:30.102
They need to be in Bahn-Franc.

1426
01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.891
I think my bottom line is.

1427
01:21:36.065 --> 01:21:38.415
I want to be able to run
my business from my porch.

1428
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:40.199
At least part of the time.

1429
01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:42.506
I learned that that's what
I like to do.

1430
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.160
I can work. I can sew.

1431
01:21:44.334 --> 01:21:46.510
I can watch my best friend's
baby grow up.

1432
01:21:46.684 --> 01:21:48.512
Jean-Marc. I want the kind
of success

1433
01:21:48.686 --> 01:21:50.688
that doesn't destroy my soul.

1434
01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:54.039
And. I'm afraid that
if I accept your offer.

1435
01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:56.389
that's what's gonna happen.

1436
01:21:56.563 --> 01:22:00.828
And. I want to be able to sew
someone's prom dress

1437
01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:02.613
if I want to.

1438
01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:07.052
And spend time with the people
that I care about.

1439
01:22:07.226 --> 01:22:10.447
Is that realistic for
a fashion designer?

1440
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:13.363
I can make it my reality.
I know I can.

1441
01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:16.061
And. I'm. I'm good with it.

1442
01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:19.021
It's the everyday.
It's the process.

1443
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.197
I want to enjoy it.

1444
01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:25.810
Twenty percent of your company.

1445
01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.945
You could use the cash flow.

1446
01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:32.295
and it would put you well ahead
in the business plan.

1447
01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:35.124
He's not gonna own 20 percent
of me.

1448
01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:36.864
-Ten.
-Fifteen.

1449
01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:38.954
-Ten.
-Done.

1450
01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:41.260
You have no say
in what I create.

1451
01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:43.567
You're only along for the ride.

1452
01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:47.266
Deal.

1453
01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:50.443
I have to steal her away
for the media.

1454
01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:57.929
Mr. Davenport.

1455
01:22:58.103 --> 01:23:00.888
I appreciate you being balanced
in your writing.

1456
01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:02.368
I didn't come off as...

1457
01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:04.109
A complete jerk.

1458
01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.983
That's fair.

1459
01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:10.898
Lisa said that you only read
the parts that you were in?

1460
01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:13.162
Oh. of course I read all of it.

1461
01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:15.077
After.

1462
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:17.993
It's you. it's in your writing.

1463
01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:20.908
The care you took in describing
her journey.

1464
01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:23.041
the way she looks at you.

1465
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.263
I'm not really sure what to say.

1466
01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.617
Well. you have much to say.
but not to me.

1467
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:35.532
I have 10 percent
of her company.

1468
01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:38.491
and you. 100 percent
of her heart.

1469
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.015
Hm.

1470
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:43.453
-Salut.
-Salut.

1471
01:23:54.203 --> 01:23:56.074
Go get her. Dad.

1472
01:24:07.303 --> 01:24:10.132
...Anyway. so yeah. yeah.

1473
01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:25.147
Do you need a minute?

1474
01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:27.323
Oh. no.

1475
01:24:30.456 --> 01:24:32.893
Congratulations.

1476
01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.070
On all of it. you did it.

1477
01:24:36.245 --> 01:24:39.378
It feels like a giant weight
has been lifted off me.

1478
01:24:39.552 --> 01:24:41.554
I'm spinning.

1479
01:24:41.728 --> 01:24:45.080
Can you hear the ringing
in my ears or is it just me?

1480
01:24:48.692 --> 01:24:51.086
I couldn't have done this
without you.

1481
01:24:54.524 --> 01:24:57.222
I've imagined a scenario
just like this.

1482
01:24:57.396 --> 01:24:59.920
Standing with an
incredible woman

1483
01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:04.055
who literally takes
my breath away.

1484
01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:11.845
You've already been there
for some pretty big moments.

1485
01:25:12.019 --> 01:25:14.457
And you are a rock.

1486
01:25:14.631 --> 01:25:16.937
You know. this whole time
I've been thinking about

1487
01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.852
what I want to do with my life

1488
01:25:19.026 --> 01:25:22.900
and I keep getting images of you
rattling around in my head.

1489
01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:28.079
And then it hit me.
that was it.

1490
01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:32.475
Spending time with the people
you care about.

1491
01:25:32.649 --> 01:25:37.610
And one of those people is you.
Colin.

1492
01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:40.265
And. I know that that scenario

1493
01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:48.273
includes a precocious
and wonderful teenager.

1494
01:25:48.447 --> 01:25:51.407
And I'm ready.

1495
01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:55.454
I'm ready for all of it.

1496
01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.762
How about you?

1497
01:26:12.428 --> 01:26:15.431
So. is that a yes?

1498
01:26:15.605 --> 01:26:18.216
That's a yes.

1499
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:20.958
How is this for an ending
to the memoire?

1500
01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:22.612
I'd say pretty good.

1501
01:26:22.786 --> 01:26:26.006
Do you want me to write it
or should you?

1502
01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:28.922
Why don't you jot down some
ideas and I'll get back to you.

1503
01:26:29.096 --> 01:26:30.576
Ok.
