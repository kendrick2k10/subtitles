3
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.500
Don't tell Mom or she will nag you.

4
00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.666
Help! My bag!

5
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.416
Thief! Help!

6
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.916
My bag!

7
00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.916
There's an attack.

8
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.416
It's okay now.

9
00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958
Shut up!

10
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:38.708
Shut up!

11
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:42.541
You're all too slow!

12
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:43.791
Be quiet!

13
00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:48.875
I told you to keep quiet!

14
00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.875
You too. shut up!

15
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:54.708
Hurry up!

16
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.208
<i>Are you saying</i>

17
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.791
<i>that you are not related
to the human trafficking</i>

18
00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:14.541
and gunshot incident
which happened early this morning?

19
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.958
My client has clearly stated

20
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:18.625
that he was merely transiting

21
00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:20.333
while on his way back to Thailand.

22
00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:23.333
He has no idea what happened.

23
00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:26.416
Mr. Fan has a witness for that.

24
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.000
He was not there.

25
00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.000
but that doesn't mean
he is not related to it.

26
00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.333
You have no evidence.

27
00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:34.166
We reserve the right
to pursue legal action.

28
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.125
We found that you and your son.
Fan Zhi Kang.

29
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.375
were entering the country
at the same time.

30
00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:45.666
We also found

31
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.041
that he made a call to you
before he was killed.

32
00:11:55.708 --> 00:11:58.333
We found the eighth child victim's
dead body

33
00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.625
in the container at the crime scene.

34
00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.208
Both kidneys were removed.

35
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:08.750
Coincidentally. your son was found dead
outside the container.

36
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.750
To avoid being traced.

37
00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.791
you didn't even pick up the last call
from your son.

38
00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:19.541
You're such an interesting father.

39
00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.000
I have reason to believe

40
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.375
that your son is somehow related
to this case.

41
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.458
I sympathize with the victims' families.

42
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.416
If my son is proven to be the culprit.

43
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:37.250
I will bear full responsibility.

44
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:45.208
Aren't you supposed to find out
the murderer of my son

45
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:49.583
for the sake of the victim's family too?

46
00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:03.666
Why didn't you detain Four Face Buddha?

47
00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:07.333
He shifted all the responsibility
to his son.

48
00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.291
We don't have enough evidence
to detain him.

49
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.041
To keep himself out.

50
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.750
he would sacrifice his son?

51
00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.000
Don't worry.

52
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:19.541
Interpol will monitor him.

53
00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:42.958
{\an8}-Vincent. come over here.
-Come here.

54
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:44.541
{\an8}Hey. did you bring the money?

55
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.541
Do you want to eat McDonald's later?

56
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.083
Okay. but you can't let my mom know.

57
00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.416
Okay.

58
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.208
How dare you sneak out here to play?

59
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:57.875
What if someone kidnaps you? Let's go.

60
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.208
{\an8}Have you seen my daughter?

61
00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:32.666
{\an8}I don't know.

62
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.708
{\an8}I don't know anything.

63
00:15:33.791 --> 00:15:34.916
{\an8}You don't know?

64
00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:37.583
What's happening?

65
00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.000
It's him! Ask him!

66
00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.125
He was the one who did it!

67
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.375
Where are those children?

68
00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:09.750
Where is my daughter?

69
00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:11.458
Are you crazy? How would I know?

70
00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:36.083
Where is my daughter?

71
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Zhong Yi!

72
00:16:58.833 --> 00:16:59.875
<i>Chia Zhong Yi</i>

73
00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.333

74
00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:07.833
<i>due to abuse of power as a policeman</i>

75
00:17:07.916 --> 00:17:10.166
<i>and causing injury to others.</i>

76
00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:37.875
<i>Mr. Wu. you have been supporting</i>

77
00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.916
<i>World Day Against Trafficking in Persons
for years.</i>

78
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.083
Do you have any message for society?

79
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.416
Hi. everyone.

80
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.750
Today is July 30th.

81
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.208
Every year on this day.

82
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:51.000
through my ability and my influence.

83
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:54.416
I hope that everyone in the world
will pay more attention

84
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.750
<i>to the severity
of human trafficking issues.</i>

85
00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:59.375
<i>In every country.
no matter the refugees' origin country.</i>

86
00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:00.458
<i>the transit country.</i>

87
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:02.541
or the target country of migration.

88
00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.750
they have the human trafficking issue.

89
00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:09.333
According to the joint report
on global human trafficking.

90
00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:12.166
two-thirds of the people

91
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.250
who have been taken away are children.

92
00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:16.583
which is a serious problem.

93
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.875
In this digital era
when technology is so developed.

94
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.291
we scroll the phone every day.

95
00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:23.166
We seem to forget to care about the people

96
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.250
and the things around us.

97
00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.500
I'm here now to remind you all.

98
00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:29.208
When you are walking on the streets.

99
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:32.916
if you see there are children left behind
with some stranger

100
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.333
and they do not interact
like family members…

101
00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.625
You may save an innocent child.

102
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.916
I am here to tell you.

103
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.666
let us fight the crimes together

104
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.708
and prevent human trafficking.

105
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.291
You have the right to remain silent.

106
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.291
What you say or do

107
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.125
can be used as evidence in court
against you.

108
00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:18.625
Dad. Mom…

109
00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:20.625
Sir. we found them.

110
00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:05.833
PUNCAK ALAM CORRECTIONAL CENTER.
MALAYSIAN PRISON DEPARTMENT

111
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.083
<i>I'm a man.</i>

112
00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:52.250
<i>How can I keep this girl's toys with me?</i>

113
00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:53.958
That's not a toy.

114
00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:55.875
It's a Valentine's Day gift.

115
00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:57.458
My birthday is on Valentine's Day.

116
00:26:57.541 --> 00:26:59.083
I'm also your past life's lover.

117
00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:00.875
I want you to bring it along
wherever you go.

118
00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:02.750
<i>You must always take it with you.</i>

119
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:04.833
I don't want it. Give it to Mom.

120
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.666
I don't want it.

121
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.833
<i>I want you to have it.</i>

122
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.083
Hazel!

123
00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.666
Give me back my daughter!

124
00:27:34.666 --> 00:27:36.750
It has been one whole day.

125
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.250
Our baby will be so scared.

126
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.625
Will the kidnappers…

127
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:45.083
I want to look for her. Let me go.

128
00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:47.500
All my colleagues
are already searching for her.

129
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:48.833
Calm down first!

130
00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:03.083
What are the policemen for?

131
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:08.958
Give me back my daughter!

132
00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:24.750
Hello. I'm a volunteer from an NGO.

133
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.208
Can you spare me some time?

134
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:28.333
I would like to introduce you to this app.

135
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:29.833
It is called Be My Protector.

136
00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:31.916
There is a feature
that you can make a report with.

137
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.458
Once you notice
any stranger acting strange.

138
00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:37.291
you can use this app to notify us.

139
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:38.583
-I see.
-Yes.

140
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:47.833
Zhong Yi.

141
00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:25.333
Have you seen this girl?

142
00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:27.208
My daughter has gone missing.

143
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:28.625
Have you seen this girl?

144
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.500
She is about this tall.

145
00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:31.625
Contact me if there's news.

146
00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:33.166
Excuse me. sir.

147
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.000
Have you seen this girl?

148
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:36.583
Who is she?

149
00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:38.291
She is my daughter.

150
00:29:38.375 --> 00:29:39.875
She has gone missing.

151
00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:42.708
I think I saw her yesterday.

152
00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:45.500
Just around the corner.

153
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.708
What kind of a mom are you?

154
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.875
Let me take you there.

155
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:50.375
Thank you.

156
00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.833
It's just there.

157
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.333
Thank you.

158
00:29:54.416 --> 00:29:55.333
Hey.

159
00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:57.458
Hey!

160
00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:36.916
Darling.

161
00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:05.041
I'm so sorry.

162
00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:05.416
Get rid of him.

163
00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:33.083
<i>Please prepare the full report</i>

164
00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:35.208
and help to amend it.

165
00:36:35.708 --> 00:36:37.791
Sir. they are here.

166
00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:20.291
This is Singapore CID Leader.
Vincent Yong Zhen Dong.

167
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:22.791
He is responsible
for your extradition to Singapore.

168
00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.000
International extradition?

169
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.375
I didn't know I was that important.

170
00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:40.958
I bet you know how you'll be sentenced.

171
00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.583
It's none of your business.

172
00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:48.166
You are thinking that your dad.
Four Face Buddha.

173
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.666
will get you the best lawyer for the suit.

174
00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:56.333
At the age of 23.

175
00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:58.375
you took the rap for your dad
and was in prison for five years.

176
00:37:58.458 --> 00:37:59.958
Thereafter.

177
00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:03.041
you were stationed overseas for many years
to source for suppliers.

178
00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:04.750
On the surface.

179
00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:08.000
your market expanded
and you're making more money.

180
00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:09.250
However. in reality.

181
00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:12.416
you were left there alone homeless.

182
00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.541
Your brother. Shawn.

183
00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:19.083
was the real inheritor. wasn't he?

184
00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:25.625
But your dad
would even sacrifice your brother.

185
00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:29.125
Don't pin hope on him to save you.

186
00:38:33.583 --> 00:38:35.416
Why not cooperate with us?

187
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.166
Your sentence might be lightened.

188
00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:48.750
Don't talk nonsense.

189
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.958
You policemen bastards.

190
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:54.875
Your manipulative skills are damn lousy.

191
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.166
I repeat.

192
00:38:57.875 --> 00:39:00.916
I want to see my lawyer!

193
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.166
Now! Hurry!

194
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.625
Don't waste my time!

195
00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:06.916
No one will pity you

196
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.083
even if you die in prison.

197
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:20.500
Officer Yong.

198
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:23.291
Someone is looking for you.

199
00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:57.000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Come again.

200
00:39:57.083 --> 00:39:58.125
Sure. if God's willing.

201
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.500
For a meal next time.

202
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:54.416
Just kill them!

203
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.666
Follow me!

204
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.125
Let him go!

205
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.458
Zhong Yi!

206
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.875
How am I going to find Hazel?

207
00:48:32.583 --> 00:48:34.083
No way!

208
00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:35.500
I want to meet Savior.

209
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.250
I want to ask him
about my daughter's whereabouts.

210
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:39.458
I'm sorry.

211
00:48:39.541 --> 00:48:41.166
We can't let you meet him.

212
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.083
James!

213
00:48:42.166 --> 00:48:44.000
-Please follow the procedure.
-Zhong Yi.

214
00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.208
You have crossed the line.

215
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Nothing is more important than my family.

216
00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:30.625
But in this case.
we all have to follow the procedure.

217
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.541
Back to work. everyone!

218
00:50:49.083 --> 00:50:50.250
Boss.

219
00:50:50.333 --> 00:50:51.916
Ghost's action failed.

220
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.875
He was killed by the police

221
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:56.083
and that guy wants to see you.

222
00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:29.750
My hand!

223
00:52:59.708 --> 00:53:01.208
<i>My birthday is on Valentine's Day.</i>

224
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:02.875
<i>I'm also your past life's lover.</i>

225
00:53:02.958 --> 00:53:05.000
<i>Now. I'll give you a gift.</i>

226
00:53:05.083 --> 00:53:06.625
<i>Thereafter. every year.</i>

227
00:53:06.708 --> 00:53:08.791
<i>you must give me a birthday gift.</i>

228
00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:21.083
Happy birthday.

229
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:31.750
Happy birthday. my sweetheart.

230
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:40.041
I'm sorry.

231
00:53:40.541 --> 00:53:44.833
I owed you birthday presents
for the past three years.

232
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.291
I thought our daughter came back.

233
00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.791
How did the shoes
you bought for her look like?

234
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.375
Was there her favorite bow?

235
00:54:31.541 --> 00:54:33.458
Size 33?

236
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:35.041
It has been three years.

237
00:54:35.958 --> 00:54:38.416
She wears size 37 now.

238
00:54:39.166 --> 00:54:40.500
You bought the wrong size.

239
00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:45.750
I promise I will bring our daughter back.

240
00:54:46.666 --> 00:54:48.833
We can still be the same as before.

241
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.708
Dad!

242
00:58:39.791 --> 00:58:41.625
-Aisha. watch out!
-Dad. help!

243
00:58:41.708 --> 00:58:44.250
-Watch out. Aisha!
-Dad!

244
00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:45.541
-Dad!
-Hey!

245
00:58:49.333 --> 00:58:50.625
-Hey!
-Let me go!

246
00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:52.000
Dad. help!

247
00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:50.958
Bring her out.

248
00:59:56.791 --> 00:59:59.166
-Aisha!
-That's enough. bring her back.

249
01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:01.125
Dad!

250
01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.416
Aisha!

251
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.250
Aisha!

252
01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.708
Dad loves you. Aisha.

253
01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:51.583
Dad!

254
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.541
Aisha…

255
01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:01.666
I'm so sorry. Aisha.

256
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.083
Aisha!

257
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.916
I promise I will save you. Aisha.

258
01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:14.958
I'm so sorry. Aisha.

259
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.166
Over there. On the right. speed up.

260
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.333
Go left.

261
01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.375
Drive faster.

262
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:04.875
It has been a couple of days
since we've been on the same shift.

263
01:04:25.041 --> 01:04:26.458
So you are finally here.

264
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.916
I waited for you long enough.

265
01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.041
Officer Yong. we found the car.

266
01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:35.208
But Four Face Buddha and Aisha
are not in the car.

267
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.375
James.

268
01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.833
Honey.

269
01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:28.958
Bastard police!

270
01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:31.833
Kill them!

271
01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:33.125
Damn policemen!

272
01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.416
Lower the ladder.

273
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.500
Faster.

274
01:09:01.416 --> 01:09:02.458
Speed up more!

275
01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:12.000
<i>Give me back my daughter!</i>

276
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:19.000
Don't come over here!

277
01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:07.500
I'm sorry.

278
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.166
I couldn't bring our daughter back.

279
01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:17.958
Why is your body full of scars?

280
01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:20.958
Does it hurt?

281
01:14:31.916 --> 01:14:33.541
I want to go home.

282
01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:37.000
Let's go home. all right?

283
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.333
Let's go home.

284
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.708
Let's go home.

285
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.416
A bomb.

286
01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:16.583
Hurry…

287
01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:18.625
We need to hurry!

288
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.875
You don't have to save me.

289
01:16:29.958 --> 01:16:31.000
No!

290
01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:33.375
I don't want you to die!

291
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:36.041
Go! I'm begging you! Go now!

292
01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:01.750
I don't want you to die! Go now!

293
01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:04.291
I'm begging you. please go!

294
01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:06.708
Please go!

295
01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.291
I won't leave you.

296
01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:17.958
We will never be separated again.

297
01:17:37.666 --> 01:17:38.875
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

298
01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.958
<i>I will never abandon you.</i>

299
01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:38.541
I want to bring you on a vacation.

300
01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:41.000
Where do you want to go?

301
01:18:42.125 --> 01:18:43.791
I don't want to go anywhere.

302
01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.833
I want to stay with you.

303
01:18:45.916 --> 01:18:48.250
spend time with you.
and live together with you.

304
01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:49.250
Can I?

305
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.583
Yes.

306
01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:54.083
But what if when time has passed
and I am no more?

307
01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:56.083
Don't say that!

308
01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:00.250
