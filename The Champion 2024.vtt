3
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.875
Diego!

4
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.750
What? Fuck off.

5
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:14.625
Ref!

6
00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:19.375
-A red card? What do you mean?
-Cool it. Diego.

7
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:22.666
What's going on? Fuck!

8
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:28.541
What the fuck? You can all suck my dick!
Come down and play!

9
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.291
Leave me the fuck alone!

10
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.125
You're bailing on us!

11
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:35.375
Fucking leave me alone!

12
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.750
-Stop acting like a little brat!
-Me?

13
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.583
-You don't have what it takes.
-I've got plenty.

14
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.958
But no brains.

15
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.541
What about now?

16
00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:47.625
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

17
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.666
He's been on my ass the whole game!

18
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.166
Take it easy. Look at me.

19
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.750
-No filming in here.
-It's my right as a reporter.

20
00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:55.833
Stop fucking filming me!

21
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.958
THE CHAMPION

22
00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.833
Atleti's new champion started out
just like any other small-town kid

23
00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.791
with dreams of becoming a football star.

24
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.583
Thanks to his talent.
and his father's support.

25
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.375
Diego managed to catch the attention
of our country's most important clubs.

26
00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.458
Hell yeah! Give me a hug. son!

27
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.041
You're fucking amazing. Great job!

28
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.041
At the start of this season.
at just 18 years old.

29
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.833
he fulfilled his dream of
signing with Atlético de Madrid.

30
00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:29.791
But today. with only three matches left
in the La Liga season.

31
00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:33.166
the polarizing red-and-white star
finds himself caught up in a scandal.

32
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.291
Atlético has issued a statement
accepting the two-game suspension

33
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.000
imposed on Diego by the Federation.

34
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:43.250
They're also internally investigating
if he should be suspended for another game

35
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.458
since the victim of the attack
was the red-and-white team's captain.

36
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.000
This statement has stirred controversy
among the Mattress Makers' fans

37
00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.083
because. if the third-match suspension
of Diego is confirmed.

38
00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.958
we would reach
the decisive final game of the season

39
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.416
with the team's top scorer on the bench.

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.291
We'd love to have him back
for the last game.

41
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.333
but I want it to be clear
that we're not willing to pay any price.

42
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.375
Wow. dude.

43
00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.416
You better not go on Twitter.

44
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.375
What? Is it still trending?

45
00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.666
Oh yeah. bro!

46
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.208
Let them run their mouths.
They'll come back.

47
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.583
-Diego.
-What is it. my queen?

48
00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.125
-Let's go.
-Hell no.

49
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.000
-They're waiting on you.
-So what? Let them wait.

50
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.125
You really screwed up.
You have to face up to it.

51
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.083
Fuck!

52
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:34.375
They don't give a shit about me.

53
00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:36.791
If this is too much for you.
take some time off.

54
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.625
Time off to do what?

55
00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:48.833
What about you?

56
00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.500
You don't have homes?
Does this look like a hotel?

57
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.750
His friends need to have his back.

58
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:57.000
Diego told us to stay. and it's his house.

59
00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:58.250
All of this is his.

60
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.166
-Could you pass me a beer?
-Of course.

61
00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:04.875
-You want it cold?
-Yeah.

62
00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.458
-Here. have a cold one.
-What the hell?

63
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.666
-You're crazy!
-Are you stupid?

64
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.375
-What?
-And now what?

65
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.458
Do we want to keep this up?

66
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.041
You tell me.

67
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:19.166
The kid represents the club's values.
He's scored 11 goals in his first season.

68
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.583
-He'll get nowhere without discipline.
-Relax.

69
00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.083
We all want the best for the kid.

70
00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.541
Diego's a Ferrari.
his engine's overheated.

71
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:30.041
He just needs a pit stop. A media detox.

72
00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.125
A media detox?

73
00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.416
Yeah. A new image.

74
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.625
-What do you mean by that?
-To start. you will apologise.

75
00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:38.083
Me? Apologise?

76
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:41.416
-You. apologise. yes.
-What if I don't want to?

77
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.875
Do as your agent says.
or the season is over for you.

78
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.333
But I'm the fucking top scorer.

79
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.333
I decide if you get to play.

80
00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:50.916
You'll be suspended for two games.

81
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.041
-You decide if it will be three.
-Okay.

82
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:59.041
There's no room on this team
for hooligans.

83
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:02.125
Hello?

84
00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.250
Yeah. I just talked to him.

85
00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:05.875
What the fuck is a hooligan?

86
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.000
What makes a genius?

87
00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.666
In the words of Charles Baudelaire.

88
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:15.666
"Genius is nothing more nor less
than childhood recaptured at will."

89
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.750
Can anyone offer me another definition?

90
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.583
Okay.

91
00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:29.291
Psychology allows us
to classify different personality factors

92
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.666
that are typical of genius. such as…

93
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.916
Renfe Commuter Rail reminds you:

94
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.083
for your safety.
it is forbidden to cross the tracks.

95
00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:41.291
Please use the available crossings.

96
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.958
Are you getting on?

97
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.708
Are you still afraid of people?

98
00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:07.083
Alex! Hey. Alex!

99
00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.750
What's going on?

100
00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:15.458
I've been looking for you.
You won't answer your phone or WhatsApp.

101
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.541
I don't use WhatsApp.

102
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.916
-What did I give you a phone for?
-You tell me.

103
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.375
To talk. To get lunch someday.
To hear about you and your life.

104
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.291
What do you want?

105
00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:30.166
I want you to relax.

106
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.250
Look at yourself.

107
00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.208
And to offer you
a solution to your problems.

108
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:37.291
The solution is you leaving me alone.

109
00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:38.750
There's zero risk this time.

110
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.916
One month. ten hours a week.
And you don't have to sell your house.

111
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.166
-I wasn't--
-I saw the ad online.

112
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.250
-And for dirt cheap. by the way.
-What do you care?

113
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.166
Alex.

114
00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:57.291
The house is all you have left of Mom.
I'm offering you the cash you need.

115
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.125
It will be easy.

116
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.583
It's totally legal.

117
00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:05.708
-And it's right up your alley.
-And what alley is that?

118
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:08.041
I'll tell you on the way.
We don't have much time.

119
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:08.958
Juanma.

120
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.166
I promise I won't go faster than 80.

121
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:34.958
METROPOLITANO STADIUM

122
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:36.291
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:38.625
Excuse me.

124
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:43.000
Juanma.
can you tell me what this is all about?

125
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:45.583
It's a press conference. Can't you tell?

126
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:49.833
-I'm not going in. There's so many people.
-Yes. you are.

127
00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:52.041
I'll protect you. Let's go.

128
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.750
Don't touch me.
You know I don't like to be touched.

129
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:02.041
Take a seat over there.

130
00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:13.541
What's going on here today?

131
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.500
Diego's giving a press conference.

132
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:20.416
Who is Diego?

133
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.875
All set. Time to go out there. champ.

134
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.500
No. I won't apologise.

135
00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:29.125
-You just have to read.
-Read?

136
00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.208
We wrote you a statement.
It's on the table.

137
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:34.291
-Why haven't I read it?
-I already read it. it's great.

138
00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:37.291
Read. and try not to run your mouth.
Everything will be fine.

139
00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:45.583
Good morning. everyone.
Thank you for coming.

140
00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:54.708
"I've come here today
to ask for 'forgiveness'."

141
00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:00.125
"That's why I want to announce 'pudli'…

142
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.416
publicly that…

143
00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:10.708
that I will start taking
'inlensive' classes…

144
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:19.958
with the goal of finishing my education
that I gave up

145
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.000
to pursue a football career."

146
00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:24.541
What the fuck?

147
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:27.416
To help Diego make this decision.

148
00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.750
which is supported by the whole team.

149
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:33.875
we have one of
the best educational psychologists

150
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.916
in the country.

151
00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.458
Alejandro Castro!

152
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.125
-What will the classes be like?
-Will they be a good thing for the team?

153
00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:50.416
Hey. stop!

154
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.666
I don't know how I fit into all this.

155
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.083
The hardest part is behind you.
Now. just do your thing.

156
00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:01.583
Two things. First. I'm not a psychologist.

157
00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.416
-I do research.
-Who cares?

158
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.125
You're perfect for the job.

159
00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:07.958
Your problem is
you don't know how to sell yourself.

160
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.833
And second. I hate football.

161
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.000
No. You hate Dad.

162
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:14.916
Okay.

163
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Think it over.
You've never been offered a better job.

164
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.916
And the two of us can hang out.
What else do you want?

165
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.166
The truth is we're better off
living our separate lives.

166
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.041
You need the cash.

167
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.541
It's not all about money. okay?

168
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:11.000
ALEJANDRO CASTRO IS THE NEW PROFESSOR
FOR THE FOOTBALL PLAYER

169
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.458
FOR SALE

170
00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.458
Yago. Rodrigo. apologise to this man.

171
00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.750
-Fuck off!
-Are you Alejandro?

172
00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:42.875
Yeah. that's me.

173
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Look. Luismi. This is Alejandro.

174
00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:50.375
We said three o'clock. That's crazy!

175
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.458
So much wasted space.

176
00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:02.416
We have no margin.
The stock price has fallen 5%.

177
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.083
It has potential. don't you think?

178
00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.416
No way. We'll cut into our profits.

179
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.708
That wall has to go.

180
00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:09.625
Impossible. That's a load-bearing wall.

181
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:10.833
Well. that one. then.

182
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:14.083
No offence.
but this all looks really old-fashioned.

183
00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.750
Hey. kid.
I'm sorry. but you can't touch this.

184
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.208
-Yes. I can.
-No. you can't. This is my house.

185
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.333
Not anymore. My dad's buying it.

186
00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:34.791
Excuse me.
could you not touch my computer?

187
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:37.500
You have pictures
of kids on your computer.

188
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.125
There are so many books here!

189
00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:40.250
Do you have comics?

190
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:44.291
Please. I told you not to touch anything.
I'm asking you nicely.

191
00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.583
Wow. look what you've done!

192
00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:51.666
Alejandro. we've thought it over.
and we'll sign right now.

193
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.208
But the old people furniture
and the books have to go.

194
00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:02.416
I guess you're staying there.

195
00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:40.958
TUES. 16 MAY
JUANMA - 50.000 €

196
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:55.625
Diego. keep going! Keep playing!

197
00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:58.458
-Let's go! Come on!
-Yes.

198
00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.125
Good!

199
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.166
I want to see
real commitment from the kid.

200
00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:15.125
And payment at the start of the month.

201
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:19.541
You want. want. want. but give nothing.
Not even a good morning.

202
00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:22.791
You did the right thing.

203
00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:26.208
What would our asshole father say
if he saw us working together?

204
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.916
And looking so handsome. Come here. Smile.

205
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Don't touch me. Juanma. Please.

206
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.875
Damn it! You're a fucking loser!
What the hell are you doing?

207
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.291
-What do you want?
-Where are you going?

208
00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:42.750
Diego! Hit the showers.

209
00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:45.125
-The showers?
-Hit the showers and cool off.

210
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.583
For fuck's sake!

211
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:49.708
He's a hothead. I don't know
what you want me to do.

212
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:53.208
Yes. he's a hothead.
But he's worth millions.

213
00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:57.833
He needs a brain. not a teacher.

214
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.583
Fuck!

215
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:23.708
Announcing your lessons
worked like a charm.

216
00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:26.333
It's really hitting home.
It's what we wanted.

217
00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:29.041
the sponsors and the press
eating right out of our hands.

218
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:30.125
What do you say?

219
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:33.583
Yeah. son. It's a good look for you.
What do you think?

220
00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:36.416
Besides. nobody's talking about
the headbutt anymore.

221
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.625
We'll sell this like a championship game.

222
00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:41.291
And Alejandro is going to help us. Right?

223
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:44.875
I'm going to the restroom. Excuse me.

224
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:03.458
What's up? Are you into me or something?

225
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:04.875
Excuse me?

226
00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.166
You've been staring at me the whole meal.

227
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.166
-You're sitting opposite me.
-I don't like being looked at.

228
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:14.250
-Then you picked the wrong job.
-I don't like your face.

229
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.875
You have no choice
but to put up with it for a while.

230
00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:22.750
We'll see. I do whatever the fuck I want.
You got that?

231
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.625
It doesn't seem like it.
Out there. everyone talks for you.

232
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.000
Fuck! For God's sake!

233
00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.791
It works better
if you put your hands underneath.

234
00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:43.583
Listen. I pay you.
and you respect me. okay?

235
00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:46.833
-Okay.
-Get the hell out of here.

236
00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:48.625
Fucking hell.

237
00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:50.083
Your zip.

238
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.208
For fuck's sake.

239
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:03.875
-Everyone on your marks.
-Let's go.

240
00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.250
Ready. set. fuck you!

241
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:14.250
We're winning! Come on. run!

242
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:17.083
Get it in there. For God's sake.

243
00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:29.250
Grab one!

244
00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:32.583
Hurry up!

245
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.833
What are you doing? Come on!

246
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:53.166
The champion!

247
00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:54.750
God's sake!

248
00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:06.458
Cannonball!

249
00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:10.291
What's Ceci doing?

250
00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:13.041
What are you doing? That's mine!

251
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:14.333
-My phone!
-Ceci!

252
00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:15.583
Out!

253
00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:17.875
-Ceci. chill.
-I don't want them here.

254
00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.125
Jesus. Ceci.

255
00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.208
Ceci. honey. let's calm down.

256
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.750
Do you want him to get injured?
Does this seem normal to you?

257
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:28.500
If he can't play.
he needs to let off steam somehow.

258
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.625
He certainly isn't with you.

259
00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.416
Ceci! Don't get mad.

260
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:49.791
If I catch you screwing around again.
you're really in for it. Got it?

261
00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:02.625
We're almost there.
You might want to roll up the windows.

262
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:06.458
-Cars stress me out. I can't breathe.
-Suit yourself.

263
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:13.666
-How do you think the first day will go?
-Do you have experience with athletes?

264
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.250
-Is Diego really illiterate?
-Professor!

265
00:20:20.541 --> 00:20:21.458
I warned you.

266
00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.625
-Nuno.
-Good morning.

267
00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:33.291
Professor. my man!

268
00:20:34.791 --> 00:20:36.041
Good morning.

269
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.500
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

270
00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:39.125
-All good?
-Yes. Thank you.

271
00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:40.041
Follow me.

272
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:45.583
-Take that to my room. please.
-Yes. sir.

273
00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:46.500
Thank you.

274
00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:50.666
This works like a business.
We employ over 20 people.

275
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.541
It might sound easy to you.

276
00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:55.916
but I spend all day
running around and organising everything.

277
00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.125
-Everything in order?
-Yes.

278
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.833
Thanks. Professor. follow me.

279
00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:11.125
Kale juice? Antioxidant effect.
It boosts your "leebido."

280
00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.791
No. thank you. My libido is just fine.

281
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:19.041
Coffee?

282
00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:22.291
No. I want to get started with the lesson.

283
00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:25.250
-It's ten o'clock. Where's the kid?
-Downstairs.

284
00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:28.583
Nice one. kids! Very good.

285
00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:30.666
-Tito! What's up?
-Good morning.

286
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.208
Kale juice. dear.

287
00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.083
-So tasty!
-Tasty. right? Good morning.

288
00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:38.958
-Hello.
-Hello.

289
00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:41.916
-Good morning.
-Hello.

290
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Careful with these fucking stairs.

291
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:48.875
You wouldn't be the first to fall down.
But don't worry about it.

292
00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:52.166
We've got everything set up for you.

293
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.250
Jackets. shirts. vests. shoes.
They're all in your size.

294
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:58.250
Just take your pick.

295
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.958
-I brought my own clothes. Thank you.
-That's the point.

296
00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:07.791
-We just want you to look your best.
-What you see is what you get.

297
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:11.458
-Yeah. I can see that.
-Saray. honey. how's my champ doing?

298
00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:13.000
He's almost ready.

299
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.416
When you're done. you can do him next.

300
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.333
-Okay.
-Great.

301
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.375
-No way I'm doing that.
-Saray's great.

302
00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:24.000
You'll look ten years younger.

303
00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:26.583
But you know I don't like being

304
00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:27.625
-touched.
-touched.

305
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.583
Alex. relax.
All of this is for the media. Don't worry.

306
00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:37.000
It's the champ's first day of class.
You do your job. we do ours.

307
00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:38.791
Fine. but I'm not doing that.

308
00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:39.875
Yes. you are.

309
00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:44.458
Yes. the artistic decisions
are part of your contract. Alejandro.

310
00:22:45.458 --> 00:22:47.125
Excuse me. It's Steve.

311
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:53.125
Come here.

312
00:22:53.625 --> 00:22:56.166
Let's liven up your face a bit.
Have a seat.

313
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.166
Okay. Everything's ready. How do you feel?

314
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.916
Fine. I get suspended.
and then you bring in this guy.

315
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.625
God's sake.
I ordered a Monster like three hours ago.

316
00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:08.125
Where's the champ's Monster?

317
00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:10.750
Let's go! Are you asleep. or what?

318
00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:13.041
-Do I really have to do this?
-Yes.

319
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:15.583
-It's for your own good.
-Fucking hell.

320
00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:25.583
What's that?

321
00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:28.250
A book.

322
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:30.375
I don't like books.

323
00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:33.291
Yes. obviously.

324
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:35.291
Don't make fun of me.

325
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:39.083
-I'm not making fun of you.
-I'm not stupid. you know?

326
00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:43.500
An unasked-for excuse
is a clear accusation.

327
00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:46.375
Can you talk like a normal person?

328
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.958
I won't look stupid in front of everybody.

329
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:50.916
But you don't mind if it's in a stadium?

330
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.708
Remember. don't look at the camera.
Act like it's not there.

331
00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:58.791
Yeah. Forget about the camera.

332
00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.166
-Saray!
-Like it's not there.

333
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.375
Okay. Quiet!

334
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:04.000
Let's touch up his forehead.
It's too shiny.

335
00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:06.041
You look great. Come on!

336
00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:08.958
Your brother is a fucking genius.

337
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:10.916
You're nothing alike.

338
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
My brother is a snake.
A genius is something else.

339
00:24:14.083 --> 00:24:15.458
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah.

340
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:17.791
A genius is the one most like himself.

341
00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:23.791
-Okay. We're going live.
-Live where. Juan Manuel?

342
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.208
In five minutes. on the radio.

343
00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:27.791
-What radio?
-Radio MARCA.

344
00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:30.166
-I'm not doing it.
-It's in your contract.

345
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.500
…Atlético's golden boy.

346
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:33.750
We have his professor on the phone.

347
00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:36.958
who'll tell us how his lessons are going.
Alejandro…

348
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:37.875
What's up?

349
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:39.250
-What's going on?
-Hey!

350
00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:40.666
He's leaving?

351
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:43.625
Excuse me. Alejandro!

352
00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:47.000
Master! You're forgetting this.

353
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:52.041
-You can't do this to me.
-You can't force me to be a circus monkey.

354
00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:53.708
It's just an interview.

355
00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:56.666
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. at my house.

356
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.708
No cameras. no cell phones.
no makeup. no father.

357
00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:01.750
And without you. if possible.

358
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.583
Professor!

359
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.416
Good luck.

360
00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.458
Yes.

361
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.958
Take that!
Babe. did you see that sweet goal?

362
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.250
Babe? What are you doing?

363
00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:20.708
Your homework.

364
00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.166
Are you joking?

365
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:29.333
The bed isn't for reading.
The bed is for doing other things.

366
00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:32.750
Why don't you give it a try at least?

367
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:36.208
Because I don't need to.
Why should I read a fucking book?

368
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:38.541
You could listen to me
for once in your life.

369
00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:40.916
But you live like a queen.
What else do you want?

370
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.208
I want you.

371
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:45.750
-I'm right here.
-I want the old Diego.

372
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.500
I am the old Diego. Only better.

373
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:20.500
Be careful. kid.

374
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.416
Look at this place. bro. It's got style.

375
00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:34.750
What the fuck is this. bro? My God.

376
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:36.416
How is the book?

377
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.833
I don't like it.
The letters are too small.

378
00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:48.125
How much did you say you make a month?
Probably what I spend on a dinner.

379
00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.166
No. Do you write books?

380
00:26:52.041 --> 00:26:55.125
-Yeah. I've written a book.
-How many did you sell?

381
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:59.000
-Stop recording me. please.
-It's for Instagram.

382
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:01.625
Turn off your phone. spit out your gum.

383
00:27:01.708 --> 00:27:04.666
take off your headphones.
and have a seat. please.

384
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:12.291
What's that about being a genius?
Is that your thing?

385
00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:16.333
That's not important.
We're here to confront your shortcomings.

386
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:17.708
My what?

387
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:18.833
Shortcomings.

388
00:27:19.583 --> 00:27:22.000
Insufficiencies. scarcities. shortages.

389
00:27:22.083 --> 00:27:25.875
-There's no shortage here.
-You have plenty of shortages.

390
00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:30.250
You barely use 500 lexemes.

391
00:27:30.333 --> 00:27:31.166
Use what?

392
00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:32.625
Lexemes.

393
00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:37.416
You need at least 1.000
to communicate decently.

394
00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:40.416
The average person uses around 5.000.

395
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.125
And I don't think that you even use 10%.

396
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:48.958
Here.

397
00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:52.416
Read. Don't rush through it.

398
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.708
Fully read each word in your mind.

399
00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:56.750
And only say it once you're sure.

400
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:06.458
"I fell in love with football

401
00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:11.625
as I was later to fall in love

402
00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:13.916
with women."

403
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.791
"Subunly--"

404
00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:19.708
"Suddenly."

405
00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:25.375
"Suddenly…

406
00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:33.875
-inexpilcit--"
-"Inexplicably."

407
00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:36.000
You want me to read or not?

408
00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:40.250
Diego.
you need to think about how each word

409
00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:44.208
has a meaning within a sentence.

410
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.416
-Visualise it. and when you know how--
-Okay!

411
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.458
Okay. man. Okay.

412
00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:53.958
Go on.

413
00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:58.583
"inexplicably. and giving

414
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:04.875
no thought to the 'bain' to

415
00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:07.250
to the pain. and the

416
00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:11.791
or 'disup'

417
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:15.583
-or 'disupt'"--
-Diego. look closely.

418
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.333
I give up!

419
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:19.333
I give up. man.

420
00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:20.916
Fuck!

421
00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:24.875
You give up. but you have a problem.

422
00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:26.208
What problem?

423
00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:30.750
-You're dyslexic.
-You're asking to get smacked in the face.

424
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.458
You mix up letters. You confuse words.
You struggle to stay focused.

425
00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:38.541
You have dyslexia.

426
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:44.750
One out of every ten kids have it.
Nobody told you that at school?

427
00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:48.625
Everybody laughed at me at school.
But do you know what they do now?

428
00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:53.791
They park my car for me.
That's what they do.

429
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.875
And this thing…

430
00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:05.208
can it be cured?

431
00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:08.291
No.

432
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.750
But it doesn't have to limit you in life

433
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:16.708
as long as you go through
the correct cognitive training.

434
00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:22.458
Come on. Give it another try.

435
00:30:22.958 --> 00:30:25.541
I'll never use that word
in my fucking life.

436
00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:27.458
You see?

437
00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:29.875
You've developed an avoidance behaviour.

438
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.750
-You have to face up to it.
-I don't give a fuck.

439
00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:37.500
-Don't pretend you don't care.
-Care about what?

440
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.375
Improving. learning.

441
00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:42.916
-I don't care.
-I don't believe you.

442
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.333
-I don't give a shit if you do.
-Yes. you do.

443
00:30:46.458 --> 00:30:50.541
-And besides. you're ashamed.
-I'd be ashamed to be a loser like you.

444
00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:52.291
That. I would be ashamed of.

445
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.583
Read.

446
00:31:04.208 --> 00:31:06.083
You fucking suck. Alex.

447
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:14.500
Come on. give it a try.

448
00:31:14.583 --> 00:31:16.750
You're really starting to piss me off.

449
00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:21.583
"Giving no thought to the pain or…"

450
00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:24.458
OR DISRUPTION

451
00:31:26.833 --> 00:31:30.500
"Or disruption." Disruption!

452
00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:32.041
Disruption! Fuck!

453
00:31:34.708 --> 00:31:37.958
See? This is much better
than headbutting people. right?

454
00:31:54.708 --> 00:31:55.791
Yes!

455
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.250
Good!

456
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:09.125
Okay. I've got to take off.

457
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:14.083
That was a great game. Give me five!
There we go! You rock!

458
00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.416
Give me a kiss. hot stuff!

459
00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:19.958
You're the best. Diego!

460
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:25.541
-Let's keep at it.
-The lesson was from ten to one o'clock.

461
00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:27.583
Yeah. but you spent whole time playing.

462
00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:28.875
And what do you want?

463
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:32.166
You want your neighbours
to think I'm a hooligan?

464
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.541
I'll give you homework for next class.

465
00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:37.250
I don't have time for homework.

466
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:40.208
You've been suspended.
You've got all the time in the world.

467
00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.833
Alright. Master. Fine.

468
00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:47.916
But before I leave. if you don't mind.
I'm gonna take a dump.

469
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.375
Delightful.

470
00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:57.583
Next class. I want you to bring me
five lexemes that are new for you.

471
00:32:57.666 --> 00:32:58.500
Okay?

472
00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:28.791
METROPOLITANO STADIUM

473
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:44.458
Go. guys!

474
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.833
God's sake. Adán!
They're going to steal the ball.

475
00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:53.291
Fucking hell. Adán! What are you doing?

476
00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:56.333
How can leave him unmarked?

477
00:33:57.666 --> 00:34:00.000
What are they doing?
We'll lose the league.

478
00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:02.041
Calm yourself down. son.

479
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:04.583
You want me to calm down?

480
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.500
I'm sorry. Dad.

481
00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:08.791
Not here. Diego. knock that shit out.

482
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.500
Fuck!

483
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:12.416
Diego?

484
00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:21.708
It's about time. It's almost over.
Come on. let's go.

485
00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:29.125
No.

486
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.833
-No.
-Come on. They won't bite.

487
00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.541
No. Juanma. I can't do it.

488
00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:37.375
-It's just people enjoying themselves.
-They are thousands of screaming maniacs.

489
00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:40.166
Thousands of people having fun.
embracing their inner child.

490
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.625
-That's football for you. Professor.
-No. I can't do it.

491
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:46.458
They are going to do
a photo shoot for MARCA.

492
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:48.458
Student and teacher watching together.

493
00:34:48.541 --> 00:34:51.458
-It's in your contract.
-Yes. I know.

494
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:53.958
Can't you see how good you look
when you listen to me?

495
00:34:54.458 --> 00:34:56.541
Okay. come on. Let's go.

496
00:34:57.208 --> 00:34:58.125
Listen to me.

497
00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:00.208
What?

498
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:02.125
Diego is dyslexic.

499
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:05.416
What are you talking about?

500
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.625
I'm telling you that Diego is dyslexic.

501
00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:09.666
It's not something
you can treat overnight.

502
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.333
Come on. It's not a big deal.

503
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:15.541
Yes. it is a big deal.
He needs a specialist and ongoing therapy.

504
00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:17.125
Look. Alex. Focus.

505
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.291
We give the press what they want.
and then we move on.

506
00:35:20.375 --> 00:35:21.666
We won't change anything.

507
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.958
Exactly. He gets back on the field.
His father is happy.

508
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:26.750
I get my cut. You get yours.

509
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:27.666
And that's it.

510
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:33.541
-The kid's self-esteem is very low.
-He thinks he's the king of the world.

511
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.458
What am I doing here with you?

512
00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:52.041
Fuck! I just want to be
out on the fucking field. Ceci.

513
00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:55.375
Why the fuck won't they let me play?

514
00:35:55.458 --> 00:35:57.250
You'll be out there in two weeks.

515
00:35:57.333 --> 00:36:00.750
Yeah. go tell that asshole Delgado.
We'll see if it's true.

516
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:03.000
Everything will be okay. Please. trust me.

517
00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:05.916
I'm an idiot.
and the whole world knows it.

518
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.875
And if they don't. they will soon.

519
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:11.625
I don't think you're an idiot.
And your teacher doesn't either.

520
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:13.625
Really? Have you seen how he looks at me?

521
00:36:13.708 --> 00:36:16.666
Just like my old grammar teacher.
the one who called me a halfwit.

522
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.083
-A halfwit! This is all I'm good for!
-Diego. cut it out! For fuck's sake!

523
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.166
What do you want?

524
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.458
To just say. "fuck it all". Diego?

525
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:28.750
I'm so fucking sick of it!

526
00:36:38.916 --> 00:36:39.958
Babe!

527
00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:41.791
Babe. wait!

528
00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:47.458
Babe. don't give up on me.

529
00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:54.625
Don't give up on yourself. Diego.
And learn.

530
00:36:54.708 --> 00:36:57.041
You need to learn
for your future after football.

531
00:36:57.125 --> 00:36:59.458
Don't do it for your father or for me.

532
00:36:59.958 --> 00:37:02.125
-Do it for yourself.
-Babe…

533
00:37:03.458 --> 00:37:04.708
I know you can do it.

534
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:15.875
Hey. how do you get out of here?

535
00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:19.500
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for the exit.

536
00:37:20.958 --> 00:37:23.291
-We need to leave. Now!
-Why? What's going on?

537
00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:26.458
Shit. If they see us.
they'll tear us apart.

538
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:29.000
-Why me?
-Go. run!

539
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.416
We've lost the chance
to secure the league title.

540
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.208
and we just have two games left.

541
00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:37.125
Can someone explain to me
how we played today?

542
00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:39.041
Nobody leaves until I get back.

543
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:48.291
You better not come with me.
There's an exit over there.

544
00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:57.875
We can't lose hope now.
We still have two games ahead of us.

545
00:37:57.958 --> 00:37:59.375
Cut the bullshit.

546
00:37:59.458 --> 00:38:02.666
"Never stop believing" is our motto.
and you're the captain. right?

547
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.708
Yeah. but at least I was out on the field.

548
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.416
Yeah. What's your problem?

549
00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:14.375
Guys! Why the fuck aren't we playing
like we know how?

550
00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:17.750
They took the game to the left.
and what did we do?

551
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:19.958
We left the right wide fucking open.

552
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:22.625
That's why number seven
outplayed you. Águila.

553
00:38:22.708 --> 00:38:24.916
That guy drove me crazy.

554
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.708
Paquito. you should've prevented that.

555
00:38:27.791 --> 00:38:29.708
You guys have to move around.

556
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:34.458
But there was an even bigger problem.
The offensive runs were a dead giveaway.

557
00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:36.625
-Fuck off.
-I saw it coming a mile away.

558
00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:37.875
Get out of here.

559
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:42.000
I had a much better view
of everything from up there.

560
00:38:42.083 --> 00:38:46.625
If Ferrera takes the ball down the wing.
and Bonilla moves ahead.

561
00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:48.291
Romain is open on the left.

562
00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:51.083
and we have Adán up front
ready to take a shot.

563
00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:53.708
Adán is there to receive the pass.

564
00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:56.583
but the defender
is watching him from behind.

565
00:38:57.083 --> 00:38:59.958
But he's had issues
in every play in today's game.

566
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:02.291
The problem is
he was waiting for Bonilla's pass.

567
00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:04.666
and when it came.
he turned towards the ball.

568
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.625
and he fucked up.

569
00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:07.000
It's a fucking no-brainer.

570
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:11.833
But for every problem.
there's a good solution.

571
00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:14.250
The first thing we have to do is get open.

572
00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:17.708
If you make a good run. he won't know
whether to look at you or the ball.

573
00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:18.666
You throw him off.

574
00:39:19.666 --> 00:39:21.000
Bonilla receives the ball.

575
00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:24.208
I see he's going to make a pass.
and I break through the defence.

576
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:29.208
How do I break through the defence?
I slip between the two midfielders.

577
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.583
You leave them feeling like dumbasses
without knowing who should go after you.

578
00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:39.458
When the ball reaches you.
you've already left them in the dust.

579
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.291
Then you take possession of the ball.
turn towards the goal.

580
00:39:44.875 --> 00:39:48.041
and there's only one thing left to do.

581
00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:51.666
What comes next is we put the ball
through their fucking net!

582
00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:59.458
Let's kick their asses! Let's go!

583
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:01.750
Pardon me. Who are you?

584
00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:04.166
Nobody. I got lost.

585
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.708
I was looking for the exit. Where is it?

586
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:08.500
-That way.
-That way. Thanks.

587
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.583
Hi. it's your uncle Israel.

588
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:21.041
Your dad told me you're too busy.
but the town festival is on the 23rd.

589
00:40:21.125 --> 00:40:22.833
and we miss you and Ceci.

590
00:40:22.916 --> 00:40:26.083
If you could come play in our annual game.
that'd be awesome.

591
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:28.083
See you. big guy!

592
00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:38.458
Master!

593
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:40.541
What's up? Are you lost?

594
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:44.291
Get in.

595
00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:56.458
What an asshole!

596
00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:10.333
Are you crazy?

597
00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:12.375
You got me in trouble with Ceci.

598
00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:15.083
-Let me out.
-She says to take the classes seriously.

599
00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:16.041
Your girlfriend?

600
00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:18.666
Yeah. Ceci.
She said to take them seriously.

601
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:45.416
-What you are doing?
-I'm dribbling down the wing.

602
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.666
-What do you mean dribble?
-If you want me. here I am.

603
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:55.875
You're going to get us killed!

604
00:42:16.125 --> 00:42:17.041
Hold on tight.

605
00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:26.208
Shit! Fuck!

606
00:42:47.916 --> 00:42:48.916
How do you do it?

607
00:42:49.666 --> 00:42:52.375
I lose my shit.
and I say. "You're in for it."

608
00:42:52.458 --> 00:42:54.958
No. I mean…

609
00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:02.083
the way you visualise spaces.
plan movements. your reflexes.

610
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:04.500
What you just did with the car.

611
00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:08.375
Before in the locker room.
and with the Rubik's cube in my house.

612
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.583
You organise everything in your head.
How do you do it?

613
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:16.333
I just do it.

614
00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:37.083
Here we go. And his wife says. "Honey.
I think you're obsessed with football.

615
00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:38.541
and you're acting very foul."

616
00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:41.791
And her husband says. "Foul?
I haven't even touched you!"

617
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.041
Have some wine.

618
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:49.958
No. thanks.
I'm on medication for anxiety issues.

619
00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:51.666
Medication? We all have anxiety.

620
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.583
-It's okay.
-No thanks. Really. I'm okay.

621
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:56.875
Come on. Just one toast. that's all.

622
00:43:56.958 --> 00:43:57.791
Okay.

623
00:43:58.541 --> 00:44:00.708
Here we go. A toast to the future.

624
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:04.083
-To the future!
-There we go.

625
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:05.000
Let's go!

626
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.500
There are seven kinds of intelligence.

627
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:15.041
There's linguistic intelligence.
there's logical-mathematical intelligence.

628
00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:18.875
there's bodily. musical. spatial.

629
00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:22.833
interpersonal.
and intrapersonal intelligence.

630
00:44:24.083 --> 00:44:26.833
And Diego has "debel"…

631
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:31.625
Excuse me. He has developed four of them.

632
00:44:31.708 --> 00:44:33.291
But there are three that he…

633
00:44:33.958 --> 00:44:35.958
-Which three are they?
-Hold on.

634
00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:38.416
I think that's not sitting well
with your medication.

635
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.000
-Give me that.
-No. It's sitting great.

636
00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:43.000
Check it out. he's got over his anxiety.

637
00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:47.000
He doesn't have linguistic intelligence.

638
00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:49.250
intrapersonal intelligence.

639
00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.250
or interpersonal intelligence.

640
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.041
And you're completely wasted.

641
00:44:57.375 --> 00:45:03.041
However. his spatial intelligence
reflects that of a genius.

642
00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:04.541
Exactly. Like a genie.

643
00:45:04.625 --> 00:45:07.250
Like the genie in the lamp.
Make three wishes.

644
00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:09.333
Shut up. shut up. and shut up.

645
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.125
I think we should change
our classroom approach

646
00:45:14.208 --> 00:45:16.041
to try to make the most of--

647
00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:18.250
-Be careful!
-Whoa. there!

648
00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:21.166
Excuse me.
To make the most of your potential.

649
00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:24.875
Let's see. If I may.

650
00:45:24.958 --> 00:45:25.958
Listen up. Diego.

651
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:30.041
This is you. A little spoon.

652
00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:32.708
And these two are your teammates.

653
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:36.541
Observation. critical thinking. language.

654
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:39.750
What's the goal? Knowledge.

655
00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:44.583
And this is what happens
if everything falls into place.

656
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:46.750
Nice one!

657
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.666
Babe! You kept that one tucked away.

658
00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.041
Are you okay?

659
00:45:56.125 --> 00:45:56.958
Yes.

660
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:53.875
Alex.

661
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.916
Hey Ceci. where are my clothes?

662
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.041
You have to help me. please.
Don't let Diego sign.

663
00:47:00.541 --> 00:47:02.791
-Sign what?
-Your brother and Tito.

664
00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:04.916
They're up to something.

665
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:09.833
Master! You dog.

666
00:47:09.916 --> 00:47:12.250
How are you? Good morning.

667
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.875
Don't sweat it.
My father has tons of clothes.

668
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.416
You can borrow some.
You threw yours in the barbecue.

669
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.041
-Who. me?
-Imelda. bring the master some clothes.

670
00:47:22.125 --> 00:47:23.958
Yes. the race. Benja. Teo.

671
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.791
You beat us all. Don't you remember?

672
00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:27.000
I don't remember.

673
00:47:27.083 --> 00:47:29.541
You're ripped. Do you work out?

674
00:47:29.625 --> 00:47:31.875
-Good morning. my queen.
-Hello.

675
00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:35.625
Does anyone know what time it is?
And where's my watch?

676
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.208
Look. Diego.
I just got your schedule for the week.

677
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.583
You've got a full plate.

678
00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:44.791
Oh. and the agency called
and chewed me out.

679
00:47:44.875 --> 00:47:46.166
-What's going on?
-What's up?

680
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:48.208
You haven't posted on Instagram
in two days.

681
00:47:48.291 --> 00:47:50.583
Take a picture of me with the master.

682
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.458
Master! Smile.

683
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:56.250
Drink up. It'll cure your hangover.

684
00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:59.041
Alright. Practice.
medical check-up. commercial shoot.

685
00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:01.000
and the game against Betis in Seville.

686
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:02.541
-What about--
-Wait. Shut up.

687
00:48:02.625 --> 00:48:04.875
We're still working on your public image.

688
00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:07.875
Visit to the hospital
and a charity game with the kids.

689
00:48:07.958 --> 00:48:10.500
What about the town match?
The festival begins tomorrow.

690
00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:12.750
-What's the deal with the town?
-Isra asked me.

691
00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:14.583
You can't. There's no time.

692
00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:17.291
I'll talk to your uncle about it.
Maybe next year.

693
00:48:17.875 --> 00:48:19.083
-Maybe next year.
-Yeah.

694
00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:22.000
Oh. and I need you to sign two documents.

695
00:48:22.916 --> 00:48:25.375
Here and here. It's for the foundation.

696
00:48:26.958 --> 00:48:30.708
-You should read what you sign.
-I just said it's for the foundation.

697
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.708
-Jesus Christ!
-Sorry.

698
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:38.791
-Damn it!
-I'm sorry.

699
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:41.875
My bad. I was trying to grab a strawberry.

700
00:48:42.375 --> 00:48:44.583
It's all good.
We'll print out another one.

701
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:48.541
Hello. professor.

702
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:52.791
Class last night was great.

703
00:48:55.958 --> 00:48:56.791
Thank you.

704
00:49:09.125 --> 00:49:09.958
Good morning.

705
00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:12.833
So. this is your turf? Not bad.

706
00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:15.708
-Want to come in?
-Me?

707
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:19.500
-Yeah. you could sit in on the class.
-I have practice.

708
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:22.791
Never mind.

709
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.083
Good morning.

710
00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:36.791
"I felt possessed. I felt a calling."

711
00:49:37.291 --> 00:49:40.916
"I was absolutely certain
I had been born to dance."

712
00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:45.166
That's how Nureyev described his epiphany

713
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:49.166
when he snuck into
a performance of Swan Lake

714
00:49:49.791 --> 00:49:53.958
when he was only seven years old.
He was born in a train car.

715
00:49:55.333 --> 00:49:57.833
He grew up in extreme poverty.

716
00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:02.708
The Soviet dictatorship
wanted to use him as a tool.

717
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:05.958
as an object of propaganda
to incite the masses.

718
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.000
Until in 1961.

719
00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:10.916
while on a tour in France.

720
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.916
he was able to break free
from the tyranny that imprisoned him.

721
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Only then. could he focus on
what he cared about the most:

722
00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:20.208
dancing freely. without constraints.

723
00:50:21.208 --> 00:50:25.083
How was he able to stand up
against the power that controlled him.

724
00:50:25.916 --> 00:50:28.500
the unforgiving accumulation
of expectations

725
00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:30.416
that had been thrust upon him?

726
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:36.250
He accepted the risks.
And he wanted to be free.

727
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.375
Had it not been for his bravery.

728
00:50:41.458 --> 00:50:44.833
the world would've missed out
on the best ballet dancer in history.

729
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.708
A genius is the one most like himself.

730
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.541
A genius makes his own decisions.

731
00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:01.583
DAD

732
00:51:07.916 --> 00:51:10.541
Okay.

733
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:13.875
Master. start the car!

734
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:18.541
Come on. Okay.

735
00:51:24.916 --> 00:51:26.291
Guys. excuse me.

736
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:30.791
I'm sorry.
but I have an accumulation of stuff to do.

737
00:51:30.875 --> 00:51:34.125
I'm really sorry.
Thank you very much. everybody.

738
00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:35.041
Bye.

739
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.166
-Drive!
-Okay.

740
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.083
-Drive. Master. They'll eat us alive!
-Buckle up.

741
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.916
Bye. Drive. Master.

742
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.375
Bye.

743
00:51:50.208 --> 00:51:53.125
They're climbing on top of the car.
Drive. Master!

744
00:51:55.583 --> 00:51:56.916
Good.

745
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.208
Pretty sweet car. right?

746
00:52:10.416 --> 00:52:12.375
DAD

747
00:52:15.583 --> 00:52:16.416
Warranty?

748
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.333
It's like a guarantee.

749
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.375
It insures you against risks.

750
00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:22.291
Like cash.

751
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.333
Or honesty.

752
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.583
Monogamy.

753
00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:29.791
An exclusive sexual bond.

754
00:52:30.666 --> 00:52:31.875
So. you don't fuck much.

755
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:34.250
Rarely or often.
but always with the same person.

756
00:52:35.916 --> 00:52:39.958
So. you use complicated lexemes
to say normal lexemes.

757
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.916
I use the lexemes
I believe to be pertinent

758
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.125
for each situation.

759
00:52:46.416 --> 00:52:47.250
Pertinent.

760
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.833
Appropriate.

761
00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:56.500
How can you live all alone?
No family. no wife. Don't you want kids?

762
00:52:57.083 --> 00:52:58.958
No. not kids. Not a chance.

763
00:52:59.041 --> 00:52:59.875
Why not?

764
00:53:01.166 --> 00:53:05.333
-I wouldn't be a good father.
-I think you would.

765
00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:06.541
I think I wouldn't.

766
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:10.791
Carry such a heavy weight around
my whole life? No way.

767
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.583
Everybody does. though.

768
00:53:12.666 --> 00:53:15.416
Yeah.
but everybody carries it the wrong way.

769
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.208
God. You're such a worrywart.

770
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:20.916
I'm not a worrywart.
I just see things for what they are.

771
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.666
Not at all!
You just focus on the negative.

772
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.541
Think about it.
I want to have at least four kids.

773
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:28.541
And they're gonna have it all.

774
00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:31.708
I'll buy them a nice house.
I'll buy them good food.

775
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:33.375
they'll wear nice clothes.

776
00:53:33.458 --> 00:53:35.541
I'll even buy them lexemes. Alex.

777
00:53:41.208 --> 00:53:44.750
It sucks seeing you so lonely.
I'll be right back.

778
00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:47.458
Diego. Hey. Diego!

779
00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:49.916
Relax. man.

780
00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:53.208
I'm gonna give you a present.

781
00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:23.250
Alex!

782
00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:28.000
Why are you leaving?
You don't like them? We can find others.

783
00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:29.708
-Diego.
-What?

784
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:31.791
People aren't presents. okay?

785
00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:36.458
-I was just flirting.
-No. You were buying them.

786
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:38.458
I wasn't buying them. They wanted to come.

787
00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:39.833
Yes. you were buying them.

788
00:54:41.208 --> 00:54:42.541
You just don't see it.

789
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.583
It's not like you're here
with me for free.

790
00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:49.625
Exactly. You bought me too.

791
00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:51.916
And here's the deal.

792
00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:54.541
I teach you. and you learn.

793
00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.208
That's all there is to it. Got it?

794
00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:02.541
There are no personal implications.
Get that into your head.

795
00:55:04.833 --> 00:55:06.833
Hey. man. Are you okay?

796
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:09.250
Hey. Diego. Holy shit. you're Diego.

797
00:55:09.333 --> 00:55:10.958
Dude. that's Diego!

798
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.833
I'm a big fan!
Let's take a picture for my old man.

799
00:55:13.916 --> 00:55:15.958
Now's not the time. I'm busy.

800
00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:19.583
-I'll kiss your feet. I'll suck your dick.
-Not now!

801
00:55:19.666 --> 00:55:21.541
-What do you mean?
-Now's not the time!

802
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:24.000
-Just stand right there.
-I said no!

803
00:55:24.083 --> 00:55:26.708
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

804
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.541
Who do you think you are?

805
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.416
-Leave. please.
-Who are you?

806
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.791
-Show him some respect!
-Seriously. leave.

807
00:55:32.875 --> 00:55:34.083
-Are you his dad?
-No.

808
00:55:34.166 --> 00:55:35.125
Don't touch him!

809
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:40.750
That's enough! Get out!

810
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:55.291
Thank you. Eusebio.

811
00:55:55.375 --> 00:55:56.541
Anything for you.

812
00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:01.083
-You got half hour. My job is at risk.
-Okay. don't worry. Here.

813
00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:05.500
Make yourself at home. Go. Atleti!

814
00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:06.541
Go. Atleti!

815
00:56:07.583 --> 00:56:09.083
Hey. Where are you going?

816
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.416
The first time at a football stadium.
I sat in section 45. like this one.

817
00:56:15.041 --> 00:56:19.083
My father was a die-hard Mattress Maker.
As soon as we were born.

818
00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:21.958
he signed me and my brother up
as club members.

819
00:56:25.833 --> 00:56:28.333
It was the cup final against Real Madrid.

820
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.083
The 77th minute.

821
00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:38.000
Paolo Futre went sprinting
like a madman down the wing.

822
00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:43.458
trying to take on the goalkeeper.
but the defence closed in on him.

823
00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:48.333
He cut back. and. at the top of the box…

824
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:52.375
he fired a rocket…

825
00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:56.291
that left the goal shaking.

826
00:56:57.958 --> 00:56:59.708
Poor Paco Buyo didn't even see it.

827
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:06.000
Just imagine.
the whole stadium erupted into cheers.

828
00:57:08.166 --> 00:57:09.541
I looked at my brother.

829
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:11.916
We hugged each other.

830
00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:18.458
We started shouting. "Atleti!"

831
00:57:20.791 --> 00:57:23.166
I turned to hug my father. but he…

832
00:57:28.875 --> 00:57:29.833
He wasn't there.

833
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:38.166
I realised he'd put…

834
00:57:40.208 --> 00:57:42.125
a 1.000-peseta bill in my pocket and…

835
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.875
and a letter for my mother.

836
00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:51.708
And he didn't come back?

837
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.083
When I got home.
I locked myself in my room.

838
00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:00.291
And I tore down my poster of Futre.

839
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:23.375
Well. when I was a kid.

840
00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:26.416
I would also go to all the football games
with my father.

841
00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:32.166
I dreamed of playing for Atleti.
the best team in the world.

842
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:37.625
I would dream of winning the league title.
And here I am.

843
00:58:37.708 --> 00:58:39.500
And I'll be here until I retire.

844
00:58:40.708 --> 00:58:42.000
When Mom died.

845
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:45.375
I swore I wouldn't stop
until I was number fucking one.

846
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.416
until I was
the greatest player of all time.

847
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.833
For her.

848
00:58:51.708 --> 00:58:52.541
But…

849
00:58:55.666 --> 00:58:56.875
I don't have it in me.

850
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:02.125
And what do you need to have?

851
00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:05.666
I don't know. but I don't have it.

852
00:59:12.083 --> 00:59:14.916
And what about you?
Did you always want to be a teacher?

853
00:59:17.708 --> 00:59:18.750
Fuck no.

854
00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:20.458
I wanted to be a rock star.

855
00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:23.875
A rock star.

856
00:59:33.375 --> 00:59:34.208
Goal!

857
00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:40.250
Come on. Master! Let's go!

858
00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:44.833
No.

859
00:59:44.916 --> 00:59:45.958
Hey!

860
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.333
That's a penalty. by the keeper.

861
00:59:48.416 --> 00:59:49.250
Okay.

862
00:59:56.291 --> 01:00:01.000
-This is where I fucked up last time.
-It's all in your head. Diego. Let's go.

863
01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:17.041
Take that!

864
01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:22.208
If they let me play on Sunday.
I want you to come watch me.

865
01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:26.416
-No. That's not possible.
-Come on. Section 45.

866
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.541
I'll score a goal for you.
Do it for me. please.

867
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:33.625
I want you to find your love
for football again. I'll help you find it.

868
01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.583
Come on. What do you say?

869
01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:36.916
I can't…

870
01:00:56.666 --> 01:00:57.583
Who is it?

871
01:00:57.666 --> 01:00:58.500
Babe!

872
01:00:59.416 --> 01:01:01.041
Diego. where are you?

873
01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:03.041
Look out the window.

874
01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:06.125
What are you doing?

875
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.458
Listen. your dad is really pissed.

876
01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.583
You didn't show up
for commercial shoot or for practice.

877
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.083
We've got something important to do.

878
01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:36.375
FAIR AND FESTIVAL OF ROSARIO
MAY 15TH TO THE 19TH

879
01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.541
Did you see how nice it turned out?

880
01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:27.125
Please. my little brother
can make a much better one.

881
01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:30.291
What are you talking about. girl?
Just look at it!

882
01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.291
-Girl!
-What's up. babe?

883
01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:34.625
How are you? Long time no see!

884
01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:36.166
There he is!

885
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.583
-Uncle Isra!
-What are you doing here?

886
01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:40.041
The ogre let you come?

887
01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:43.291
-I snuck away.
-Well done. kid. Well done.

888
01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:46.750
Your mother would be
so happy to see you in town.

889
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.875
-I'll let everyone know.
-Go for it.

890
01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:51.541
Girls. let's take a picture.

891
01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:53.791
Yes. please! Can you take it. Alex?

892
01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:55.416
Diego. sit in your old seat.

893
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.958
Say cheese on three.

894
01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.750
One. two. three.

895
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.541
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

896
01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:06.083
-Let me see!
-Let's see how it turned out.

897
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.541
Oh. I love it!

898
01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:09.833
You look so pretty!

899
01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.458
Yeah. I love it. Come on.

900
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.208
You liked it better out there. right?

901
01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.500
Diego!

902
01:03:58.583 --> 01:03:59.708
Goal!

903
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:29.708
This is a fucking disaster.
We told the club he'd attend every game.

904
01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:34.208
-So what? The campaign is working.
-Yeah. It's working fucking wonders.

905
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:41.250
-When I find him. I'll kill him.
-Let's not get all riled up.

906
01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:44.750
-This is just a small setback.
-A small setback?

907
01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:47.583
We have no idea where my son is.
for God's sake.

908
01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.083
-We're going to hit the jackpot.
-We better.

909
01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:16.625
Wow! What an awesome day.
We'll get chewed out when we get home.

910
01:05:16.708 --> 01:05:17.583
You'll see.

911
01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:19.625
How would you say "chew out."?

912
01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:22.458
Reprimand.

913
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.833
Cool.

914
01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.458
Look at him.

915
01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:37.791
I haven't seen him
this happy in a long time.

916
01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:45.291
Thank you so much. Alex.

917
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:55.708
Look. I'm just giving him tools.
You're the one who's really helping him.

918
01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:01.500
Well. you know that's not true.

919
01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:05.833
The dude at the register
was wearing my shirt.

920
01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:08.416
You should've seen
his face when he saw me.

921
01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:15.333
Seriously. today was an epiphany.

922
01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:16.583
Oh. please!

923
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:31.333
Hey!

924
01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:37.791
Never again. You got it?
Never ignore my calls again.

925
01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.291
-Ceci. go upstairs.
-No.

926
01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:40.500
Ceci. please.

927
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.875
You can't just do whatever you want.

928
01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:50.750
So I just have to do
whatever the fuck you want?

929
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.291
Don't disrespect me. okay?

930
01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:56.500
What about me?

931
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.708
Where the fuck is my respect?

932
01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:08.166
This is what I get after all I've done?

933
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.708
Let's go! There we go.

934
01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:35.666
Professor. my man!
How are the lessons going?

935
01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:41.166
Well. Diego is making a lot of progress.

936
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:45.250
I didn't know
the lessons included excursions.

937
01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:51.833
Okay. kids. Good game!

938
01:07:51.916 --> 01:07:53.958
We're putting an end to these classes.

939
01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:57.916
-What?
-He's not cut out for studying.

940
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.583
He was born to do this.
Nuno will take you home.

941
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.583
Are you firing me?

942
01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:15.500
I don't want you near my son ever again.

943
01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:17.958
You got that?

944
01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:30.833
-We have to go. Professor.
-Yes! I'm going to play!

945
01:08:31.333 --> 01:08:35.083
Alex. you're gonna see me play!

946
01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:38.375
I'm not a hooligan anymore!

947
01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:41.375
Let's go.

948
01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:46.916
I don't know if the club forgave me.

949
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.125
All I can say
is that this league belongs to Atleti!

950
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:55.750
Let's give the best surprise in the world
to the best player in the world.

951
01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:58.291
Diego!

952
01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:21.666
Yeah!

953
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:25.833
You guys are the best. I love you so much.

954
01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:27.291
-You deserve it.
-Thanks.

955
01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:29.458
Drink up! Hell yeah!

956
01:09:31.833 --> 01:09:34.875
-Hey. is Ceci not coming down?
-Forget about her.

957
01:09:34.958 --> 01:09:38.166
Don't let her ruin your night.
Enjoy yourself. man!

958
01:09:38.958 --> 01:09:43.000
Guys. I'm gonna go get changed.

959
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:53.375
Babe. this is crazy.
They love me out there.

960
01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.541
Diego. you have a game tomorrow.

961
01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:01.666
And I'll be in bed at midnight.
just like Cinderella.

962
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.250
Here. let me.

963
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.000
Wow!

964
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:10.166
It looks great. So handsome!

965
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.583
Do you know what looks good on me?

966
01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:14.791
Look. You look good on me.

967
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:18.083
-I can't argue with that.
-The best thing in the house.

968
01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:21.166
Oh. by the way. I can't forget about this.

969
01:10:22.458 --> 01:10:25.208
-I don't have pockets.
-I'll hold it for you.

970
01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:26.333
Thanks. baby.

971
01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:49.375
Don't even think about
mentioning your brother.

972
01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:52.083
-We'll talk about that later.
-Why? What's going on?

973
01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:55.000
-Do you want to join him?
-I closed the deal with the Brits.

974
01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:59.250
-Fuck off. Really?
-We'll sign after the game.

975
01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:01.958
Holy fucking shit! That's great.

976
01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.250
Let's fucking go! Fuck yeah!

977
01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:06.666
-Tito.
-Diego can't know about it yet.

978
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.708
-This stays between us.
-Okay.

979
01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.791
Nice fucking work. you motherfucker.

980
01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:14.625
Tito. partner! Go have a drink and relax.

981
01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.583
-I need to talk to him.
-I don't care.

982
01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:35.166
-Come on.
-I'm telling you--

983
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.250
-Hands off.
-What's up?

984
01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.166
Your brother.

985
01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:39.750
-Hey. stop!
-Okay.

986
01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:44.375
-What are you doing here?
-What's going on? Why ignore my calls?

987
01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:46.833
Like you do to me?

988
01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:48.500
You're not part of this anymore.

989
01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:51.166
If we're done with classes.
I want to tell Diego myself.

990
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:55.125
-Where are you going?
-To talk to Diego. I just told you.

991
01:12:05.541 --> 01:12:08.375
Okay. Nuno. Let him go.
I'll handle it. Really.

992
01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:14.375
Alex…

993
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.958
Hey. are you okay?

994
01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:23.916
-This was all just a charade. right?
-What?

995
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.750
You've been using me. and Diego as well.

996
01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:31.500
Aren't you supposed to be
the mature brother?

997
01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:32.416
And?

998
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.458
-Who cares about the lessons?
-Diego cares about them.

999
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:39.833
No. He wants to be number one.
the best in the world.

1000
01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:42.166
and that's all he's
wanted since he was five.

1001
01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.125
And how do you know what the kid wants?

1002
01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:46.166
Because I represent players
all over Europe.

1003
01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.458
And I know these kids.

1004
01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.250
They have a dream.

1005
01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:54.666
They are winning horses
who have gone all in on one race.

1006
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.875
They want to taste the fame.
glory. and money.

1007
01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:02.291
And you know what?

1008
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:05.333
I know how to give it to them.

1009
01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:07.791
Because I'm the best at my job.

1010
01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:10.458
Alex. I love my life.

1011
01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:12.375
Life isn't just about winning.

1012
01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:14.708
What you have is a shitty. empty life.

1013
01:13:15.666 --> 01:13:17.750
You're using the kid
to fill that emptiness.

1014
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.916
Diego is signing with Manchester.

1015
01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:28.750
It means he'll play
at the highest level at 20 years old.

1016
01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:32.041
Any kid his age would give their life
for a chance like that.

1017
01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:33.041
Their life.

1018
01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:42.541
-Diego's dream is to play for Atleti.
-I know what he wants. Trust me.

1019
01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:46.791
And deep down. so do you.

1020
01:13:48.916 --> 01:13:52.500
-I just want to help him.
-Then leave him alone.

1021
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.666
It's best if you leave
without making a fuss.

1022
01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.000
Right now Diego needs to focus.

1023
01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:07.000
Nuno. my brother is leaving.

1024
01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:13.750
It's best if he doesn't see you here.
We'll talk to him. okay?

1025
01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:19.583
Here's your check. Go home. man.
Rest up. pay your bills. write a book.

1026
01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:22.833
Go get laid. but leave the kid alone.

1027
01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.958
He wants to play football.

1028
01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:31.000
Don't worry. He'll forget all about you.

1029
01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:55.083
Master. where are you going?

1030
01:14:57.541 --> 01:14:59.083
-I'm going home.
-Already?

1031
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.833
Yeah. you know that I…

1032
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.416
My head is about to explode.

1033
01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:08.916
My father told me
we won't have any more lessons.

1034
01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:12.875
Now is not the time.

1035
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.333
Really?
He also told me you got paid 100 grand.

1036
01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:16.500
and you're taking off.

1037
01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:23.541
What's wrong?
You can't talk about that either?

1038
01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:30.083
It was all a fucking lie.

1039
01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:32.791
You take the money
and leave like everyone else.

1040
01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:35.125
-You're a fucking traitor!
-Drive.

1041
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:38.375
-You're just like everyone else.
-Diego!

1042
01:15:43.958 --> 01:15:44.875
Diego.

1043
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:48.791
Leave me alone!
All of you. leave me the fuck alone!

1044
01:15:53.666 --> 01:15:54.541
I don't know.

1045
01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:56.291
-Are you okay?
-I don't know.

1046
01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:57.666
Move!

1047
01:16:12.291 --> 01:16:15.083
-Juanma. Diego's on his way.
-How's his ankle?

1048
01:16:15.166 --> 01:16:17.875
It's pretty bad.
But don't worry. he won't play today.

1049
01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:19.125
This is important.

1050
01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:22.375
If the Brits find out his leg is injured.
we're in big trouble.

1051
01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:24.416
No. My son won't go out on the field.

1052
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.541
I hope not. Nobody wants a star who limps.

1053
01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.833
He's not going to play. Don't worry.

1054
01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:30.833
-Tito.
-Get the contract ready.

1055
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:32.166
We'll sign it.

1056
01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:48.791
Hey!

1057
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:49.708
Hi. Dad.

1058
01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.250
I can play.

1059
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:55.208
No. son. There's no way you're playing.

1060
01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:58.041
At least let Arsenio examine me.

1061
01:16:58.125 --> 01:17:01.541
I said no.
I won't risk your career over one game.

1062
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.583
What are we?

1063
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.333
A team.

1064
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:11.750
What's our goal?

1065
01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:15.416
-To make me a champion.
-Fuck yeah.

1066
01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:18.500
I'll never let you down. son. Never.

1067
01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:24.416
Diego! I have a question.

1068
01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:36.875
He can't play like this.
I think injection is the only option.

1069
01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:40.083
Cortisone will relieve the pain.
but only temporarily.

1070
01:17:40.166 --> 01:17:43.791
But the injury could be at risk
of worsening significantly.

1071
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500
It's your choice.

1072
01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:57.666
Come with me.

1073
01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:00.875
Let's forget about Diego.
Today is do or die.

1074
01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:02.291
It's do or die!

1075
01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:06.041
Let's go!

1076
01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:18.125
WHAT MAKES A GENIUS?

1077
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:36.916
Alex. what happened?

1078
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.208
Nothing. The contract is cancelled.

1079
01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:51.958
He gave me this for you.

1080
01:18:58.958 --> 01:18:59.958
Thanks.

1081
01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:03.500
Go on. you're going to be late.

1082
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:22.791
…watch the game here at home.
and it's really very exciting.

1083
01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:26.208
Atlético de Madrid
may still win the league championship

1084
01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:28.375
at their home stadium
in front of their fans.

1085
01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:31.125
A win here is crucial to make it happen.

1086
01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:33.708
Winning this game is their only option.

1087
01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:34.708
Ring me up. please.

1088
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:38.208
…a lot of excitement. full of energy.
and I told my teammates.

1089
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:40.291
"Who would have said that we'd make it

1090
01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:43.958
to the last game of the championship.
with the chance of winning the title?"

1091
01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:45.125
What do I owe you?

1092
01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:48.083
I am confident in the work
the team has put in and I hope…

1093
01:19:48.166 --> 01:19:49.166
Four-fifty.

1094
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:50.625
…throughout the whole season.

1095
01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:52.750
and we can celebrate with our fans at home

1096
01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:54.916
and give them the joy that they deserve.

1097
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.625
And tonight. at long last.
Diego is back playing with his team.

1098
01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:01.583
After suffering two unforgivable defeats.

1099
01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:05.458
the team has recovered their star player
and hopes to break their losing streak.

1100
01:20:05.541 --> 01:20:09.333
That's what the fans long for.
a sentiment shared by Diego himself.

1101
01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:13.041
with whom we exchanged a few words
before he entered the locker room.

1102
01:20:14.625 --> 01:20:17.416
Being in the starting line-up
isn't up to me.

1103
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.916
It's up to the coach.

1104
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
But of course I would love to.

1105
01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:26.625
And I'd also love to live up
to the accumulation of expectations

1106
01:20:26.708 --> 01:20:28.416
that the fans have of me.

1107
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.416
Thank you very much.

1108
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.958
Diego. one question.

1109
01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:32.083
What's your opinion--

1110
01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:53.875
Excuse me. Are you free?

1111
01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:55.166
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1112
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.541
Talk to you later.

1113
01:20:57.291 --> 01:20:58.541
Buckle your seatbelt.

1114
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.041
Metropolitano Stadium. please.

1115
01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:04.000
Let's go.

1116
01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.791
-How are you. man?
-What's up? How are you?

1117
01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:30.708
Fine. and you?

1118
01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:34.458
-I'm fine. All good.
-Let's see what happens tonight.

1119
01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.416
Hi. how are you?

1120
01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:39.166
How are you? Hello.

1121
01:21:40.125 --> 01:21:41.208
How are you doing?

1122
01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:44.833
-We're going to win today.
-Yes. I hope so.

1123
01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:46.375
How are you?

1124
01:21:57.458 --> 01:22:04.333
Atleti! Atleti! Atlético de Madrid!

1125
01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:12.125
Atleti! Atleti! Atlético de Madrid!

1126
01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:19.958
Playing. winning. you fight like the best

1127
01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:24.250
The fans always shake with passion

1128
01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:26.916
When you become the champion

1129
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:34.291
And you see a real team before the ball

1130
01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:42.958
Diego!

1131
01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:12.166
Tonight. Atlético will play
for the league title.

1132
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.791
The red-and-whites need to win.

1133
01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:16.166
That's their only path
to winning the championship.

1134
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:19.458
We have received news from the bench
that Diego will be not playing.

1135
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:22.208
Atlético de Madrid will play
with Beato as their keeper.

1136
01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:24.791
A five-man defence line
of Tejerida. Nikima…

1137
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.166
Why isn't the kid playing?
Are they stupid or what?

1138
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:32.208
…attacking midfielder for Álvaro Sánchez.
up front in attacking position…

1139
01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:01.833
It's the Brits.

1140
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.458
-They'll ask why he isn't playing.
-Go take care of it.

1141
01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.375
Okay.

1142
01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:18.458
Danger here. Valencia counterattacks.
Be careful at the centre!

1143
01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:22.000
Goal!

1144
01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:27.000
Valencia scores!
So long. league title! Atlético is…

1145
01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:36.166
…they need to score two goals.
Two goals to…

1146
01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:55.125
METRO - METROPOLITANO STADIUM

1147
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.666
Can I help you?

1148
01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:30.250
Section 45.
The next door. right by the bar.

1149
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:48.375
You're fucking asleep out there!

1150
01:27:07.416 --> 01:27:10.583
-Get open!
-Fucking put the kid in!

1151
01:27:22.166 --> 01:27:24.666
What are you doing? You can all eat shit!

1152
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:26.250
This is fucking bullshit!

1153
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:46.000
No foul!

1154
01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:20.833
Hey!

1155
01:28:30.666 --> 01:28:33.291
Diego! Hey!

1156
01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:40.458
Diego!

1157
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:43.541
Diego!

1158
01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:02.583
Holy shit! Diego wants to play! Let's go!

1159
01:29:02.666 --> 01:29:03.708
Diego!

1160
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:37.916
…for fucking once!

1161
01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:44.166
Come on. Put him in! Let's go!

1162
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.250
He's going to be sold.
The kid is going to be sold.

1163
01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:51.166
-What are you saying?
-They're selling him to Manchester.

1164
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:54.500
It's already been settled.
behind the club's back.

1165
01:29:54.583 --> 01:29:55.583
How do you know that?

1166
01:29:55.666 --> 01:29:58.791
You're his teacher.
Holy shit. it's Diego's teacher!

1167
01:29:58.875 --> 01:30:00.833
-He says he's going to Manchester!
-What?

1168
01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:04.875
Shut up! He's not leaving!
He's staying to play in all the games!

1169
01:30:04.958 --> 01:30:08.000
God fucking damn it!
He's staying to play for my…

1170
01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:11.791
I'll make sure he plays in all the games!
You don't know shit!

1171
01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:17.916
-Diego's not for sale!
-Diego's not for sale!

1172
01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:37.666
What's going on?

1173
01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:41.125
-Motherfucker!
-Tito!

1174
01:30:42.583 --> 01:30:49.000
Diego's not for sale!

1175
01:30:54.625 --> 01:30:57.250
-What are they saying?
-Go back to the bench.

1176
01:31:20.125 --> 01:31:22.750
Move! Don't you dare inject him!

1177
01:31:22.833 --> 01:31:24.333
You can't be in here.

1178
01:31:24.416 --> 01:31:26.583
-My son won't be playing.
-Yes. I will.

1179
01:31:26.666 --> 01:31:27.583
Over my dead body!

1180
01:31:29.375 --> 01:31:30.458
Diego. son.

1181
01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:32.625
-Please. just listen to me.
-No.

1182
01:31:34.708 --> 01:31:35.541
No.

1183
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.041
Do you have something to tell me?

1184
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:42.750
-We heard you're going to Manchester.
-That's a lie!

1185
01:31:42.833 --> 01:31:43.791
-Hey!
-Let go!

1186
01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:45.541
-Stop!
-Calm down or get out.

1187
01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:48.166
Don't you see?

1188
01:31:48.833 --> 01:31:51.208
These people can't stand you.
They're jealous.

1189
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:53.166
They just want to fuck you over.

1190
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500
Grab your things and come with me.

1191
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.375
-You know what? You're a fucking moron!
-Hey!

1192
01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:19.625
-You can't even spell your own name.
-Calm down or get out.

1193
01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:22.208
You'd be nobody without me.

1194
01:32:22.291 --> 01:32:24.250
You'd be fucked without me!

1195
01:32:24.333 --> 01:32:25.583
You hear that?

1196
01:32:25.666 --> 01:32:28.458
He can't play
with his fucking ankle like that!

1197
01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:31.250
Call security. Get the hell out of here!

1198
01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:33.375
I'm gonna kill you. motherfucker!
