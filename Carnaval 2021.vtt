00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.166
Pick six cards. Nina.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.458
The Empress.

6
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:32.833
You have a great ability to communicate.

7
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:34.625
You're very charismatic.

8
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:38.708
You have a natural ability

9
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:41.125
to captivate people.

10
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.291
Yeah. People always tell me that.

11
00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.625
Other than your family.

12
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:49.875
who would you say is very close to you?

13
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.250
Oh. my girlfriends.

14
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.041
They are like my second family.

15
00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.875
Mayra. who's a veterinarian.
is my "bestest" friend.

16
00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.458
Esoteric. indecisive.
it's like she's always daydreaming.

17
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.625
-And there is--
-Strong bonds. indeed.

18
00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:05.541
Michelle.

19
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.500
She has a big heart.
She's always making new friends.

20
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.875
We fight sometimes.

21
00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:18.791
but I know I can always count on her.

22
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.000
And Vivi. she's a geek.

23
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:24.083
She lives in her own world.

24
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.083
It's hard to get her out of there.

25
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:30.666
It looks like you have
a very glamorous life. Nina.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.041
The life of a digital influencer.
you know?

27
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.000
I have 327.000 followers.

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.791
But my goal is to get my first million.

29
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.708
Yeah. but in The Moon.

30
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.708
all that glitters is not gold. Nina.

31
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.500
Cell phone cases!

32
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.375
Do you like your boyfriend?

33
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:10.166
Marcão? You bet I do.
Let me show you Marcão. You'll see.

34
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.333
Just look at him.

35
00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.291
Such a hot number. Selene!

36
00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.041
He's just my type!

37
00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:20.166
I'm talking about the number of followers!

38
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.666
438.000.

39
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.958
You're gonna go on a trip.

40
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.166
You're really good!

41
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.916
I'm going to Aspen.
Marcão closed a deal. and he's taking me.

42
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.291
Well. I don't know where you're going.

43
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.500
but it will be a turning point
in your path. Nina.

44
00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.041
Believe in your destiny.

45
00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:47.375
Trust the power
of life-changing experiences.

46
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.500
You have everything
you need to shine. Nina.

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.416
All you need is courage

48
00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:59.583
to be who you really are.

49
00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.375
But be careful. Nina.

50
00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.083
In your quest to conquer it all.

51
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:09.583
you might lose what you really love.

52
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.583
@NINA FERPANNI
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS

53
00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:26.291
You can stop. It's okay.

54
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.000
Can you hold this?

55
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:28.916
Thank you.

56
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.583
Don't waste any time.
Our store has anything you want.

57
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:33.833
What is this?

58
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.791
Marcão?

59
00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:40.500
Son of a bitch!

60
00:03:57.416 --> 00:03:59.583
Fuck. Marcão! You cheated on me!

61
00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.333
-What's that?
-How embarrassing!

62
00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:06.000
Me. the person who loved you the most!

63
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:08.125
Calm down. Let's talk over there.

64
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.750
-Don't touch me! Get your hands off me!
-Calm down.

65
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.708
I texted you. I tried to talk to you.

66
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:17.458
Fuck. Marcão. How could you do this to me?

67
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.416
-It went viral. okay? Everyone saw it.
-Everyone?

68
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.416
But look. Nina. I want to talk to you.
I want to explain.

69
00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:28.458
You want to explain?
I'd love to hear your explanation.

70
00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:31.750
-Well. I'm--
-There isn't one. Marco Antônio.

71
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:32.750
And it was with a…

72
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.416
A woman with 1.437 followers.

73
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.250
One thousand four hundred!

74
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.166
And 37.

75
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.750
You wouldn't understand. you know?
We're not on the same page.

76
00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.458
-What about the trip?
-Well. we're not going.

77
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.875
I mean. I'm going. but with…

78
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:51.791
with…

79
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.541
Forget it.

80
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.083
I can't believe it!

81
00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:01.333
I'm telling you. babe.
Sex shops are the best.

82
00:05:01.416 --> 00:05:02.250
Really?

83
00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:06.583
You'll love it.
There's always something new.

84
00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:09.916
Flavored panties like strawberry.
annatto. chili pepper.

85
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.083
-And…
-That's wonderful!

86
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:14.541
Now that you met me.
make sure to stop by.

87
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.625
You'll love it.

88
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:17.625
Bye. foxy.

89
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.166
Sorry. guys. I was doing
some sales consultant business.

90
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.083
-Just work stuff.
-Okay. we know.

91
00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:26.458
But what matters now
is to be there for Nina.

92
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:30.583
-Let's go in peacefully. harmonically.
-I've never seen her like that. really.

93
00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:33.666
-Have you seen her posts?
-Oh. come on! I didn't have any time.

94
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.458
Plus. you know Nina
is the queen of overreacting.

95
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:37.500
Look who's talking!

96
00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:40.041
Look. it's depressing. Look at that.

97
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.291
TEN WAYS TO WIN IN LIFE

98
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.500
What about this one? And the worst part.

99
00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:46.250
Nina became a meme.

100
00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:47.916
-Meme?
-Meme.

101
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.125
-Meme?
-Yes. a meme.

102
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.541
I don't get it.

103
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:55.166
She's Ms. Suffering.
but she has time to post and edit stuff?

104
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.458
Look. I love Nina. but she's so lame!

105
00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:00.125
After she became an influencer.
everything went downhill.

106
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.375
I'm sorry.
it's still too hard to talk about it.

107
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.958
But this gig will help me a lot.

108
00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:11.833
How much?

109
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:23.875
Can I ask you something?

110
00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.000
If I forgo my payment.

111
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.708
can I take three people with me?

112
00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:32.916
I'll hold.

113
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:38.541
You won't believe
where we'll spend Carnival this year.

114
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:39.500
All right.

115
00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:44.083
Okay. then. Thank you. Talk to you later.

116
00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:49.125
-Tell us!
-Don't leave us hanging!

117
00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.375
Girls!

118
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.708
We'll have to spend Carnival

119
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.458
in Salvador!

120
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:01.541
Everything free. VIP bands.
the whole shebang!

121
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:02.458
Oh my God!

122
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.208
Finally. this wannabe Instagrammer
will be of use to us.

123
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:11.375
Stop that! I was on the phone
with Freddy Nunes' press agent.

124
00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:14.291
-Oh my God. Freddy Nunes.
-That's right. Freddy Nunes.

125
00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:18.625
He invited me to spend Carnival there.
and you're coming with me!

126
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.208
It's gonna be
the best Carnival of our lives!

127
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:28.333
Guys. I'm very excited.
but who's Freddy Nunes?

128
00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:30.791
-Should I know who he is?
-Come on! For God's sake.

129
00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.125
-How would I know?
-Show her.

130
00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:34.125
-Everyone knows who he is.
-Here. look.

131
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:38.916
Does it feel good? Go down...

132
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.750
I do know him. I mean. the song.

133
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:43.000
I've never seen him.
He's not my type anyway.

134
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:46.916
Oh. come on. Speak for yourself!
A hottie like him?

135
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.500
If I see him in Salvador.
Lord have mercy. because I won't!

136
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.625
Guys. I would love to go with you.

137
00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.083
but I don't know.

138
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.666
It's Carnival. It's too crowded.

139
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.083
I can't.

140
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:07.041
Hey. no other place
is more spiritual than Salvador.

141
00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:11.708
Well. I know it's Carnival.
but have I ever gotten you in trouble?

142
00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:14.208
Mayra. sweetie.

143
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:17.708
I won't let go of your hand.
no matter what.

144
00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:31.125
Don't worry.

145
00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:33.791
You can trust me.

146
00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.000
I don't know if I can.

147
00:08:55.583 --> 00:09:00.250
Can you imagine us on the trio elétrico?

148
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:06.541
Oh. that's great you're here

149
00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:09.708
Welcome to Salvador

150
00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:14.125
The heart of Brazil

151
00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:17.000
Of Brazil!

152
00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:19.625
Come. you will get to know…

153
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.583
I'm not singing.

154
00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:25.916
The city of light and fun

155
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.125
Running after the trio…

156
00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.000
What is this? La La Land?

157
00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:38.375
You'll see that people from Bahia
Are full of energy

158
00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:44.916
They have God in their hearts
And the devil on their hips

159
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:10.583
Okay? Hey! Hi. ladies!

160
00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:14.666
My name is Salvador.
I will be your tourism coordinator.

161
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.291
Wow! You have the same name as the city!

162
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.166
Baptized and registered
with the name of my city.

163
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.250
Look. I was born in Bahia. in Salvador.
and I'm very proud of it.

164
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:27.541
By the grace of Our Lord of the Good End
and Saint Dulce of the Poor.

165
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:29.791
-Axé!
-All the grace.

166
00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.541
If you need anything. just talk to me.

167
00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:35.416
This year will be tough
since I have to work on Carnival.

168
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.541
You know what I mean? But it's cool.
There's no way around it.

169
00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:41.375
I'm cool. I'm good. dude. You know why?

170
00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:44.458
Because I'm always here. body and soul.

171
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.833
Got it?

172
00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:52.000
Well. your words. not that much.
But your body language is great. Damn!

173
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:56.000
-And they say people from Bahia are slow.
-What? Who said that?

174
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:59.125
People from Bahia dash
at every crossroad full speed ahead.

175
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:02.541
They are brothers.
they have faith in Oshala.

176
00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.125
It's you girls who are slow.
You're late for Carnival.

177
00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:07.333
It started yesterday.
You know that. right?

178
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:11.000
-No way!
-I could have planned it sooner!

179
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.375
So. shall we get going?

180
00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.166
Yes. sure. Let's go.

181
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.708
I'll take yours. okay?

182
00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:19.750
Thank you.

183
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:29.250
Get out of here!

185
00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:34.166
Of course. She's one of the influencers

186
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:37.291
Guys. this girl is unbelievable.

187
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:38.541
She knows what's up.

188
00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:42.541
She's flawless. spiritual.

Ladies. your car is here.

192
00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:53.416

The spacious van

198
00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:10.833
It'll be great. you'll see.

199
00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:12.625
Lead the way. Michelle.

200
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.666
Howdy. Rosa.

201
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.708
Dude. Vitória lost another game.

202
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.083
Now I'll have to deal with the rivals.

203
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.625
Anyway. that reservation under Nina?

204
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.458
All good. The room is ready.

205
00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:29.875
Great.

206
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.541
Hey! Ladies. this is Samir.

207
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.625
He takes care of our guests.

208
00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:36.333
Hi. Samir. How do you do?

209
00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:37.708
I'm Vivi... Vivian.

210
00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.750
Oops. hi.

211
00:12:40.833 --> 00:12:43.875
Samir will be your guide in Salvador.

212
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:45.916
What's that?

213
00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:49.875
You can trust him. He's good people.

214
00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.875
Salvador. you're leaving us already?

215
00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.375
Of course not! I'll be around.

216
00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:59.875
Rosa. can you tell me
Luana Di Sertanzo's room number?

217
00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.375
-Luana?
-No. Luana is at another hotel.

218
00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:05.416
She's at the resort next door.
All the influencers are staying there.

219
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.541
Well. isn't she an influencer?

220
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.291
-There must be some kind of mistake.
-This isn't fair!

221
00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:12.333
Ladies!

222
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:15.333
That resort is for influencers
who have over a million followers.

223
00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:17.541
So. that's it. Forget it.

224
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.833
Anyway. with this wristband.

225
00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:24.000
everything that you do in this hotel

226
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:27.458
will be paid for by Freddy Nunes. okay?

227
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:28.750
What about the red ones?

228
00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:31.458
They are for the resort next door.

229
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:34.458
Should you need anything.
just give me a call.

230
00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:35.791
Anything.

231
00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.041
-Let's bounce. Sam.
-Yes.

232
00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:39.416
-Bye. ladies.
-Bye.

233
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.625
-Bye. Rosa.
-Bye. thank you.

234
00:13:40.708 --> 00:13:42.666
Bye. See you around Bahia.

235
00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:46.500
-I call dibs on the larger bed!
-Ouch! Go!

236
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.916
Yeah. it's not…

237
00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:00.375
Man. the best part of the room
is the view.

238
00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:04.458
But look. we got a Freddy gift bag.

239
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:07.250
Look at that. Let's see what this is.

240
00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:10.500
That's hot.

241
00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.291
He is actually hot. Michelle.

242
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:17.875
And this will help me
get my first million followers.

243
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.458
-That's true.
-Guys! You have to see this!

244
00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:26.041
-Damn!
-Even I got excited.

245
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:29.875
-Let's get changed and go down there.
-That isn't our hotel's pool.

246
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.416
It's Luana's hotel.
And you see that golden dot up there?

247
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.625
It's not an Oscar.
It's her. Luana Di Sertanzo.

248
00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:45.000
Luana is already posting.

249
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.375
Professional.
No wonder she has ten million followers.

250
00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.291
Then let's get changed
and check out our hotel's pool.

251
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:56.250
What? You might be able
to take great pictures.

252
00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.000
You wanna bet?

253
00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:06.708
Man. thank God we didn't bet any money.

254
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:08.875
Fire!

255
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.333
My hair!
Get out of here. you little devils!

256
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.500
Are you happy now. Mayra?

257
00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:20.375
Now to the other side. like that.
Look. like that.

258
00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:26.333
Michelle. you brought
your red lipstick. right?

259
00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:27.250
Huh?

260
00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:31.791
Look at our red bands!

261
00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.291
This is simply wonderful!

262
00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:37.750
Wow!

263
00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:45.041
Pool time!

264
00:15:55.791 --> 00:16:00.458
Girls. welcome to paradise!

265
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:15.958
Hey! How are you?

266
00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:20.833
Thank you.

267
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:23.916
Detox. guys.

268
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.166
-You're so lame. Mayra.
-Come on. Michelle.

269
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.916
-A toast!
-A toast!

270
00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.166
But seriously. I should be over there.

271
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.625
-Freddy is so hot.
-Babe magnet.

272
00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:38.708
He's not really my type.

273
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:42.166
There's no need to rush.
We have a full menu today.

274
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.666
Getting intimate with the floor

275
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.625
Getting intimate with the booty

276
00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:49.791
Does it feel good? Go down

277
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.500
Getting intimate with the floor

278
00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:53.750
Getting intimate with the booty

279
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:54.750
Go down

280

-Let's take a selfie.
-Okay.

285
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:07.875
Another one.

00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:12.375
Guys. it's Luana!

287
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.625

289
00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:20.625
Excuse me. guys.

-You're so beautiful!
-Thank you.

292
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.291
Your eyes are really green!

293
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:30.791
I'm nervous. I'm sorry.

294
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.500
Take a deep breath.

295
00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:33.416
Deep breath.

296
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:38.625
-You don't know me yet. but I'm Nina.
-Nice to meet you.

297
00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:41.708
I'm shaking.

298

00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:48.291
-And I always see--

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:49.708
I do recognize you.

301
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:51.833
-Really?
-I saw a meme once…

302
00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:56.083
-You're the CrossFit Cuckold!
-Oh. yeah.

303
00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.458
Guys.

304
00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:02.083
There's no such thing as bad publicity.
Right. Mirna?

305
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:06.083
Right. And it's Nina. My name is Nina.

306
00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:09.833
Shall we? If you'll excuse us.

307
00:18:09.916 --> 00:18:11.208
Isn't life funny?

308
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:16.125
Now we are here.
in the same group of influencers.

309
00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:19.375
Yeah. I never thought I'd be
in the same group as a meme. I love it.

310

Well. it was nice to meet you. Virna.

-Sure.

313
00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:35.625
-Do you have your phone on you?
-Oh. of course.

314
00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:37.916
-Silly me.
-No worries.

315
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.083

-Nina. and? How was it?
-Tell us.

335
00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:28.583
-Relax. guys.
-Luana is cool. but kind of aloof.

336
00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:29.500
Is she a bitch?

337
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.541
-What did she do?
-We recorded a story.

338
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.125
-On my phone.
-So. it's useless.

339
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.791
What if she likes it?

340
00:19:39.875 --> 00:19:40.708
-Right?
-Wow!

341
00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:44.166
-What if she comments on it?
-That'd be great!

342
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.875
-What if she reposts it?
-What if you wake up. girlfriend?

343
00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:52.291
Let's make a toast.

344
00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:56.000
Let's do it before I make out with the DJ.

345
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.625
Does it feel good?

Now that's French.
What are you trying to pull?

352
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.458
Your wristbands
don't grant you access to the resort.

353
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:22.791
So. let's go. please?

354
00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:25.333

362
00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:51.666
Let's just leave with class.

-We just need to get our stuff. Chop-chop!
-Sure. thank you.

There's Mrs. Mommy. She's an artist.
Your abadá will look great.

372
00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:20.958
How can I talk to your mom?

373
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.583
-Vivi. you're gonna meet his mom!

No worries. Why were they teasing you?

486
00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:39.041
This whole thing with my ex. It's nothing.

487
00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:43.041
-I'm Nina. Nice to meet you.

You look exactly like my ex. Like a clone!

492
00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:59.541
I don't know if you look like him
or if he looks like you.

493

You have the same face. the same hot body.
I don't know. it's crazy.

00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:24.791
No way.
Let's celebrate that Nina is single.

517
00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:25.958
-That's better.
-All right.

518
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:27.166
-Fine.
-And happier.

519
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.083
It's great.

520
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:32.083
I was thinking.

521
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:34.416
when we're alone.

522
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.166
it feels like the whole world
is against us.

523
00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:39.000
Right?

524
00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:42.750
I don't know.
even if the whole world is against us.

525
00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:43.666
like you said.

526
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:49.000
I think we should just keep going. Right?

527
00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:50.583
Like…

528
00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:52.500
sailing.

529
00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.625
"The world against us. sailing."

530
00:30:57.708 --> 00:31:00.166
Could be nice lyrics.

531
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.458
-Really?
-Really.

532
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:05.166
-Wow. I just got inspired.
-You're inspired.

533
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.458
Yeah. Anyway. whatever happens.

534
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:10.833
I just think we can't be afraid. right?

535
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.458
Of being happy.

536
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:19.375
Dude. please. buzz off.

537
00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:21.916
Buzz off. my ass. Vivi. Are you nuts?

538
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.583
Asking these crazy questions
that no one understands.

539
00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:26.833
Let me try to explain.

540
00:31:26.916 --> 00:31:29.291
The muscle on a guy
is inversely proportional

541
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:30.666
to how much he reads.

542
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.041
And I'm not asking hard questions like.
"What is the meaning of life?"

543
00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:37.500
Vivi. the meaning of life
is not to judge a book by its cover.

544
00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:40.291
You wanna see?
Let me prove it to you. Come here.

545
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:43.208
Focus. okay?
I'm gonna ask you a hard question.

546
00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:46.500
How much is two plus two?

547
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:48.125
Four.

548
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.583
See? He got it right.

549
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:22.833
What's your name?

550
00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:24.083
Ronaldo.

551
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.750
Where am I? Am I in heaven?

552
00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:33.750
Girlfriend? Bahia. Salvador. Carnival?

553
00:32:34.583 --> 00:32:37.625
That's it! Shake it. hottie!

554
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:41.083
Girl. that's Mayra.

555
00:32:42.791 --> 00:32:46.125
-She's the star of the show! Go!
-She's our friend.

556
00:32:50.958 --> 00:32:52.041
Hey. girlfriend!

557
00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:59.416
Girl. are you okay? Get up from the floor.

558
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.666
Floor!

559
00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:07.666
Freddy. I'm really surprised.

560
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.750
We have way more in common
than I imagined.

561
00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:14.416
That's true.
And we barely know each other.

562
00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:18.125
Floor!

563
00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:21.333
Stop with this show. You aren't Beyoncé.

564
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:22.416
What are you filming?

565
00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:25.833
-Nina. come help us!
-What happened?

566
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:29.291
Booze. moonshine. alcohol.

567
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.875
-Well. go help out your friends. okay?
-Okay.

568
00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:43.791
I'll break your phone.

569
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.625
Can I at least say goodbye to him?

570
00:33:46.708 --> 00:33:48.375
Yeah. but do it fast.

571
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.875
-What's the problem?
-Excuse me.

572
00:33:55.958 --> 00:33:58.125
-Nina.
-I came to say goodbye. Freddy.

573
00:33:58.208 --> 00:34:01.708
Let me introduce you to my manager. Jorge.

574
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:03.500
-This is Jorge.
-Nice to meet you.

575
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.291
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

576
00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:08.583
Well. see you later?

577
00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:11.916
Later on? I don't know.
My friend will get better soon. She'll…

578
00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:13.958
Give me that!

579
00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:22.291
Nina. what do you mean.
you didn't have time?

580
00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:24.166
Just grab and kiss them. Two seconds.

581
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.541
Do you remember that New Year's Eve
when we went swimming at night?

582
00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:30.208
-Of course!
-Girl.

583
00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:34.666
-Girls. let's do it again! Please!
-I'm in.

584
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.791
Nah. tomorrow I have a photo shoot
with Freddy and the influencers.

585
00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:40.375
because now I'm an influencer.

586
00:34:40.458 --> 00:34:42.583
Come on. Nina. We'll be old in no time.

587
00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:44.750
Come on. for old time's sake.

588
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:48.916
What old times? We're not 40!

589
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.875
But before you know it. we will be!

590
00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:53.375
For Christ's sake.

591
00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:57.625
Guys. don't tell me

592
00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:02.125
that I stole this for nothing.

593
00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:35.708
Where…

594
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.083
Oh. no! Guys! Wake up. please!

595
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:41.250
Come on! Vivi. wake up! Mayra!

596
00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:45.166
Please. guys. help me!
I'm gonna miss my photo shoot!

597
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.375
Grab your stuff. girls.

598
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.375
Hi!

599
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:19.833
Don't you recognize me?

600
00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:24.958
-Did I ever hook up with him?
-No. it can't be.

601
00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:28.125
-Samir.
-Wow. man!

602
00:36:28.208 --> 00:36:31.458
If you're like that. why do you go around
looking all disheveled?

603
00:36:31.541 --> 00:36:35.250
Samir. thank God. Please. help us.
I need to go back to the hotel. Help us.

604
00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:37.583
Sure. I'll drop you off
on my way to the gym.

605
00:36:37.666 --> 00:36:40.333
Gym? Not the gym.

606
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:43.750
-Let's go. then! Quick!
-Hold on.

607
00:36:44.333 --> 00:36:45.166
Quick?

608
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.833
Go. Samir! Faster!

609
00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.125
Thank you. Samir!

610
00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:03.541
-Do a mantra. Nina!
-Thanks. Clark Kent.

611
00:37:04.458 --> 00:37:06.625
-Thanks a lot.
-Wait. Vivi.

612
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.500
Well… I…

613
00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:11.750
Well…

614
00:37:12.583 --> 00:37:13.416
I…

615
00:37:14.458 --> 00:37:16.916
I was thinking
maybe we could do something later.

616
00:37:19.958 --> 00:37:20.916
No. I'm busy.

617
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.708
Hey. was that necessary?

618
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:30.041
When will you understand you don't have
to give up one thing to do another?

619
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.750
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know. Vivi.

620
00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:35.416
You're judging a book by its cover.

621
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.458
-You could at least kiss him.
-Why would I do that?

622
00:37:38.541 --> 00:37:41.791
Because I realized
a kiss can reveal a lot.

623
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.916
I have no patience for you.

624
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.458
I'm so deep today.

625
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:57.041
Oh my God. Is that how you feel
when you fall in love?

626
00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:59.750
Guys. this is the picture of the event.
Look happy.

627
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.666
Done? Okay. Great photo. guys.

628
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.708
-Waiter. bring the drinks.
-No. wait. I need to be in the picture.

629
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:10.625
Easy. Where were you?

630
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.791
Never mind. Thank you.

631
00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:19.208
Hi. Freddy.

632
00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:21.666
Excuse me. girls. Hi. Nina.

633
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.916
I'm late. My hotel is far from here.

634
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.750
-Aren't you staying here in the resort?
-No.

635
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:30.833
No. I don't have a million followers.

636
00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:34.375
You're really cute.

637
00:38:34.916 --> 00:38:38.000
Well. that's okay.
I'll see you later then. right?

638
00:38:40.958 --> 00:38:42.083
Well. bye. Nina.

639
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.250
Yes. sure.

640
00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.916
I'll talk to her and call you back.

641
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.500
Ladies. I just got a call
from Freddy Nunes' people.

642
00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:05.291
-What did you do now?
-Will we have to leave?

643
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.666
Girl. what did you do?

644
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.083
She really did something.

645
00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:10.541
-Oh. no!
-She's just a bit dense.

646
00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:13.375
Calm down. Ladies. calm down.

647
00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:15.500
It was something good.

648
00:39:15.583 --> 00:39:16.791
-Good?
-Relax. Of course.

649
00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:21.833
Because you all will be moving
to this resort today.

650
00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:25.166
-Oh my God. Thank you. my Lord Jesus.
-Michelle. get up.

651
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.000
Let me thank the Lord. I need to pray.

652
00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:31.500
Let's go get our stuff from that pigsty.
Now we made it!

653
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:33.750
-Thank you. Salvador.
-Nina?

654
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.291
I'd like to invite you to something.

655
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.500
Sure. Go ahead.

656
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:42.333
Do you want to explore
Salvador's Salvador tomorrow?

657
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:44.708
I would love to explore the city.

658
00:39:48.541 --> 00:39:50.875
Oh my God!

659
00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:56.375
Look at this! It's a house. not a room.

660
00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.875
Thank you. Lord.
The ones who were humbled are now exalted.

661
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.000
I can't believe this!

662
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.708
Man. I'll tell you.
the best part of the room is the room.

663
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:10.958
Guys. I can't believe this.
I want to live here.

664
00:40:11.458 --> 00:40:13.166
Let's go check out the bedroom.

665
00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:17.208
Ta-da!

666
00:40:46.458 --> 00:40:47.791
PERKS FROM PARADISE

667
00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:52.375
My follower count won't stop rising!

668
00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:54.875
Every time I refresh. there are more.

669
00:40:54.958 --> 00:40:57.375
I'm the best. I'm the queen of Instagram!

670
00:40:57.458 --> 00:40:59.583
Nobody gets Instagram better than me!

671
00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:02.375
You are the queen of Instagram!

672
00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:06.500
-Who is the queen of Instagram?
-Guys.

673
00:41:07.625 --> 00:41:10.125
-Luana.
-I'm the queen of Instagram!

674
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:17.875
Luana?

675
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:23.375
Hi. Now that you're staying at the resort.
we're gonna see each other all the time.

676
00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:25.458
That's great.

677
00:41:26.458 --> 00:41:27.291
Right?

678
00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:29.750
Freddy invited us.

679
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.791
Good to know Freddy was generous enough
to have you here.

680
00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:36.708
Luana.

681
00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:39.166
are you and Freddy…

682
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:44.958
Honey. online. I'm as strong as he is.
That's just silly.

683
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:48.916
But it could be good for you.

684
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.083
Yes.

685
00:41:50.166 --> 00:41:52.125
He's famous

686
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.375
and hot.

687
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.250
It wouldn't hurt.

688
00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:00.458
Couldn't you give it a like?

689
00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:02.458
Huh?

690
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:04.291
Our video that I posted.

691
00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:06.416
-You could like it. comment on it--
-Video?

692
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.666
I didn't like it
because I didn't see it. Right?

693
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.916
I'm not your friend.
so I don't follow you.

694
00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:15.125
Got it. Okay.

695
00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:20.125
Speaking of friends.
can I give you some advice?

696
00:42:20.208 --> 00:42:22.666
Sure. Please do.

697
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.625
Friends take away our focus.

698
00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:29.666
Think about it.
If a single anchor is already a hurdle.

699
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:33.125
three is a guaranteed sinking ship.

700
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:34.958
#justsaying.

701
00:42:39.541 --> 00:42:40.583
Bye…

702
00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:41.541
Nina.

703
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:43.625
Right.

704
00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:50.208
Ouch. guys! Let go of me! Hold up!

705
00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:51.333
Excuse me! No!

706
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.041
She's the peasant of Instagram!

707
00:43:00.708 --> 00:43:02.541
She's the peasant of Instagram!

708
00:43:17.791 --> 00:43:19.000
Good evening.

709
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:21.708
Let's have fun!

710
00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:24.375
Wait. my hair!

711
00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:26.041
Come on. Vivi.

712
00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:28.333
I think I forgot my card.

713
00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:30.666
Oh. no way. Check again.

714
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.875
Guys. I already did. I didn't bring it.

715
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.375
I can't believe this.
We'll have to go back.

716
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:39.041
Let's go. There's nothing we can do.

717
00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:41.041
Go ahead.

718
00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:44.208
I'll stay. It's my job.

719
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.666
That has nothing to do with your job.
It's something else.

720
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.416
Yeah. it's called professionalism.

721
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.500
No. it's called selfishness.

722
00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:56.375
Because Vivi… We know she is an airhead.

723
00:43:56.458 --> 00:43:59.000
-We know she talks nothing but nonsense--
-Michelle.

724
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:03.375
I'm defending you. But she has friends.

725
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:05.083
We're going. We're your friends.

726
00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:13.625
I think this is about attitude. Freddy.

727
00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:16.833
-I agree. but what I was supposed to do?
-Hi. Freddy.

728
00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:19.166
-Hi. Nina.
-Hi…

729
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:21.958
Jorge.

730
00:44:22.666 --> 00:44:24.125
Jorge!

731
00:44:24.208 --> 00:44:26.750
-It's Freddy!
-Let's go.

732
00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:28.333
-Hi.
-Freddy!

733
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:31.208
Jorge. go get Mr. Ailton.
I'll wait here with Nina.

734
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:32.708
Go there. please.

735
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:36.958
Freddy. you know what? I'm gonna go.

736
00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:40.083
-I'm tired. I worked all day.
-Yeah.

737
00:44:40.166 --> 00:44:41.500
I'll ask security to take you.

738
00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:42.458
-Okay.
-Okay?

739
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:44.458
Okay. Have a nice rest.

740
00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:46.875
-Bye. Nina.
-Bye. It's Jorge. right?

741
00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:53.458
Hey! Freddy!

742
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:56.833
-Yes. you! Excuse me. guys.
-My God. it's that nutcase.

743
00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:57.875
Come here. Nina.

744
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.000
Freddy. I can't believe this!

745
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:08.166
Let me through. Excuse me.

746
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:13.583
That's hot! That's what Carnival is for.

747
00:45:14.333 --> 00:45:16.041
Now it's my turn to kiss him.

748
00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:19.125
-Excuse me?
-No. I'm not that kind of girl.

749
00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:22.791
I'm talking about my Freddy. He is…

750
00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:24.625
Babe! Come here!

751
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.458
Come here!

752
00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:29.166
Right? What do you think?

753
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.666
They look so much alike.

754
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.083
Stand next to him.

755
00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:34.208
Check this out.

756
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:38.500
A head on one side. a head on the other.

757
00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:39.541
Twins!

758
00:45:39.625 --> 00:45:43.791
They are the Wonder Twins
of this Carnival in Bahia!

759
00:45:43.875 --> 00:45:45.916
-We got back together.
-You did?

760
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.500
-Yes.
-That's great. Congratulations!

761
00:45:48.583 --> 00:45:51.791
Not for you. You lost your chance
to kiss these pretty lips.

762
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:52.833
Babe. let's go.

763
00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:58.166
-You guys are gorgeous!
-Go on. Enjoy your Carnival.

764
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.458
-Gosh. she's…
-Yeah. nutty.

765
00:46:02.083 --> 00:46:03.125
-Yeah.
-Hey.

766
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.458
Wanna go to my place? Huh?

767
00:46:08.625 --> 00:46:09.791
To my place?

768
00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:13.625
I think he slipped. actually.

769
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:15.750
Make yourself at home.

770
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.458
-Careful.
-Oops.

771
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:26.416
I don't want you to get hurt.

772
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.375
I want you to feel at home.

773
00:46:45.916 --> 00:46:46.958
Come on.

774
00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:54.333
Dude. your song broke
the national download record.

775
00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:56.125
Top five worldwide.

776
00:46:56.625 --> 00:46:59.000
Freddy!

777
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:09.958
-Yeah. I'm pissed. Get off my back.
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

778
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.791
No. I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at the queen of Instagram.

779
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:16.833
She could've come with us.
She would've only missed 30 minutes.

780
00:47:16.916 --> 00:47:19.083
There's still a lot of Carnival left.
It wouldn't hurt.

781
00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:23.291
Guys. for Nina. 30 minutes
would've made all the difference. Look.

782
00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:24.958
FREDDY NUNES AND MEME INFLUENCER
HOOK UP

783
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:26.083
I can't believe this.

784
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.625
Okay.

785
00:47:28.708 --> 00:47:34.083
I'll forgive her just because. as you saw.
time cannot be wasted.

786
00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:39.666
Cannot be wasted at all.

787
00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:41.000
Where is she…

788
00:47:41.083 --> 00:47:43.250
Excuse me.

789
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:44.750
Remember me?

790
00:47:46.916 --> 00:47:49.083
What do you think? Five or ten seconds?

791
00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.541
-Three.
-Two.

792
00:47:59.625 --> 00:48:02.041
Where is it? Where are the lights?

793
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:05.583
The special effects?
The confetti on my hair?

794
00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:07.333
What happened. dude? The chick…

795
00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:10.083
-Gee. that wasn't good.
-It wasn't. Let's go.

796
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.458
Mind if I join you?

797
00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:44.708
Getting new followers did wonders for you.

798
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.583
How many do you have now?

799
00:48:46.666 --> 00:48:49.666
502… No. 507.000.

800
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.291
-Wow! Congrats.
-Thanks.

801
00:48:52.375 --> 00:48:54.000
Slow and steady.

802
00:48:56.208 --> 00:48:58.875
Are you by yourself?
I mean. without your friends?

803
00:48:59.875 --> 00:49:02.000
They're fine.

804
00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:04.166
They're having fun.

805
00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:35.291
Hello. Good evening.

806
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:44.708
Girl! I hope you're having
as much fun with your man

807
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:47.291
as we are having with all these men.

808
00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:51.083
You're missing out!

809
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:19.958
511K FOLLOWERS

810
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:29.041
Yeah. right! You're saying
you only kissed one guy? As if.

811
00:50:29.125 --> 00:50:31.041
-I think I'm gonna cry.
-It's true. guys.

812
00:50:31.125 --> 00:50:33.625
I'm telling you.
his kiss was terrible today.

813
00:50:33.708 --> 00:50:35.333
Yesterday. his kiss was so good.

814
00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:38.541
Tonight. it was like he was
another person. Horrible kiss.

815
00:50:38.625 --> 00:50:40.541
Maybe he has a split personality.

816
00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:43.958
Girl. maybe he was drunk yesterday.
Or tonight. I don't know.

817
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:46.000
Just forget it.

818
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.333
Today was the best!

819
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.500
Too bad Nina isn't here.

820
00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:56.625
Nina is having fun with Freddy.
that hottie.

821
00:50:56.708 --> 00:51:00.416
-She's smart. She wanted followers.
-True.

822
00:51:03.666 --> 00:51:06.875
Guys. Nina is here.

823
00:51:06.958 --> 00:51:10.916
It looks like it went south.
Or better. it went nowhere.

824
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.500
But the picture was a hit.
Now she has 512.000 followers.

825
00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:16.958
Yeah. it's very good.

826
00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:32.666
-Hey.
-Good morning.

827
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.416
-Morning.
-Shall we?

828
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.458
Today we reggae until sunrise.
Are you excited?

829
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:41.708
Very much so. I even invited the girls.
but they didn't show up.

830
00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:44.166
What's up. Sal? Ready?

831
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.083
What's up?

832
00:51:45.166 --> 00:51:46.416
-Hi. Sal.
-Hi.

833
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.208
-Thanks for the tour. Sal.
-Cool.

834
00:51:57.791 --> 00:51:58.750
Look!

835
00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:07.208
-Clap your hands.
-Hey. wait for me!

836
00:52:43.375 --> 00:52:45.708
-With chili.
-With chili?

837
00:52:45.791 --> 00:52:46.958
Just a little bit.

838
00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:09.958
Cheers!

839
00:53:12.708 --> 00:53:15.333
-You go. Salvador!
-You go. Salvador!

840
00:53:20.166 --> 00:53:21.333
Go for it!

841
00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:02.666
-I can't be here. It's too crowded.
-Calm down. Relax. girl.

842
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.375
What's going on?

843
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:07.000
Mayra is a little scared of crowds.

844
00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:10.666
-She's actually terrified.
-I'm okay. I just need to walk it off.

845
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.041
No. I'll go with you.

846
00:54:12.125 --> 00:54:14.708
Are you sure?
Text me if you need anything. okay?

847
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:16.750
Excuse us. she's not feeling well.

848
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:19.458
It's less crowded here.

849
00:54:20.583 --> 00:54:23.708
And it's breezy. It'll relax you.

850
00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:29.583
Pelourinho is up high. near the port.

851
00:54:30.791 --> 00:54:36.000
Everyone. right here. in this exact place.
the city of São Salvador was founded.

852
00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:37.375
Go talk to him.

853
00:54:37.875 --> 00:54:39.666
No. anyone can see…

854
00:54:40.958 --> 00:54:44.166
It's obvious
I don't have anything in common with him.

855
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.500
I can't believe this.
You're judging a book by--

856
00:54:47.416 --> 00:54:50.208
Don't you say
I'm judging a book by its cover.

857
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:53.000
Don't! Look. you know what?

858
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:56.791
I'm gonna prove to you
that we're not meant for each other.

859
00:54:56.875 --> 00:55:01.125
Other people had come here before.
and it began to emerge again…

860
00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:06.541
The countries had baroque architecture--

861
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.083
Hi.

862
00:55:09.791 --> 00:55:10.625
Vivi?

863
00:55:11.666 --> 00:55:12.541
Hi.

864
00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:13.625
How are you?

865
00:55:14.625 --> 00:55:17.833
I'm fine. Listen. the Quidditch balls--

866
00:55:17.916 --> 00:55:20.375
Quaffle. Bludger. and Golden Snitch.
I love Harry Potter.

867
00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:24.791
Okay. Well. everybody knows that.

868
00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:29.166
I want to know.
how fast does the DeLorean need to--

869
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.333
141 kilometers per hour.
Or 88 miles per hour in imperial units.

870
00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:36.083
Well. Back to the Future is a classic.

871
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:39.458
Everyone's seen it. If they haven't.
someone told them about it.

872
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:43.000
Now I want to test
your behind-the-scenes knowledge.

873
00:55:45.625 --> 00:55:48.541
What is the other last name

874
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:52.416
Luke Skywalker had

875
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:57.541
in the original drafts of Star Wars?

876
00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:59.333
Starkiller!

877
00:55:59.875 --> 00:56:01.458
Luke Starkiller!

878
00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:07.583
But wait.
What's the point of all these questions?

879
00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:09.333
Samir…

880
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:13.000
what's the meaning of life?

881
00:56:14.083 --> 00:56:15.916
The meaning of life?

882
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:18.500
Well…

883
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.375
42!

884
00:56:23.416 --> 00:56:24.291
The Hitchhiker's…

885
00:56:24.375 --> 00:56:27.291
-…Guide to the Galaxy.
-…Guide to the Galaxy.

886
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:32.166
I think I found the rarest Pokémon.

887
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.458
What does that mean?

888
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.958
That we can evolve.

889
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:48.625
I knew it.

890
00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:55.958
Cool.

891
00:56:58.541 --> 00:57:01.125
-Your glasses.
-Thank you. Did you like it?

892
00:57:01.208 --> 00:57:02.083
Loved it!

893
00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:04.375
It's so hot.

894
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:08.916
What a great view.

895
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:11.500
Beautiful. huh?

896
00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:15.916
It's the Bay of All Saints.

897
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.916
What's that there?

898
00:57:22.375 --> 00:57:23.791
It's the São Marcelo Fort.

899
00:57:31.416 --> 00:57:33.458
Look at it. For real.

900
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:35.500
Okay.

901
00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:42.666
Listen. the Dutch
took over the fort for a year.

902
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.250
But then they ran away.
afraid of the people from Bahia.

903
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:50.041
Oh. it's because they are rowdy. right?

904
00:57:50.125 --> 00:57:53.125
Yes. we are indeed.

905
00:58:30.708 --> 00:58:31.666
Ronaldo!

906
00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:39.166
It's you!

907
00:58:54.916 --> 00:58:56.000
We should stop here.

908
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.708
There's Freddy.

909
00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:01.625
I'm sorry. Salvador.

910
00:59:01.708 --> 00:59:03.083
We had a great day.

911
00:59:03.958 --> 00:59:06.500
I loved exploring Salvador's Salvador.

912
00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:09.500
But we should stop here.

913
00:59:10.666 --> 00:59:11.750
Okay.

914
00:59:11.833 --> 00:59:14.166
So. I'll introduce you

915
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.500
to the most important part of the city
after me.

916
00:59:18.583 --> 00:59:21.625
And what's the most important part
after you?

917
00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:27.875
The faith.

918
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:29.958
Come.

919
00:59:31.958 --> 00:59:33.458
Trust me. You'll like it.

920
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:39.708
It's such a privilege being born
in this awesome city.

921
01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:53.583
-Me?
-Go.

922
01:00:58.583 --> 01:00:59.458
Go.

923
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.666
My child.

924
01:01:24.458 --> 01:01:25.916
stay calm.

925
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.458
Believe in your destiny.

926
01:01:30.666 --> 01:01:33.375
Trust the power
of life-changing experiences.

927
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.916
You have everything
you need to shine. my child.

928
01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:38.875
All you need is courage

929
01:01:39.916 --> 01:01:42.375
to be who you really are.

930
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:30.708
NEW POST

931
01:02:30.791 --> 01:02:31.750
FREDDYNUNESOFFICIAL

932
01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:37.583
"Lunch party by the pool tomorrow.
Bring your friends."

933
01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:43.041
SHARE?
NO - YES

934
01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:57.708
Nina. you didn't post our picture
from yesterday?

935
01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:02.250
No. it wouldn't get me any followers.

936
01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:05.708
What?

937
01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:10.291
-What?
-No need for drama. It's my job.

938
01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:14.583
Let's do this. I'll send you the picture.
and you post it.

939
01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:17.208
Then I'll comment and like it. Okay?

940
01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:22.375
I better stay quiet.
I better not say anything.

941
01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:24.583
Nina. they're pictures of us.
They're very cool.

942
01:03:24.666 --> 01:03:26.166
Girl!

943
01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:28.208
Let me explain.

944
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.791
I have to post pictures
that will increase engagement.

945
01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:36.000
that will attract thousands of likes
and comments. That's it.

946
01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:38.666
-No. I can't take this.
-Girl. no.

947
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:42.000
Hey. Instagram Queen. here's what you do.

948
01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:45.125
Post our picture.
the one that doesn't increase engagement.

949
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:50.333
and I'll comment "#friendsforever"
a million times.

950
01:03:50.416 --> 01:03:53.791
-Michelle. don't…
-No. that's all she cares about.

951
01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.958
She wants likes and stuff.
It's what she wants.

952
01:03:57.041 --> 01:04:00.166
Listen. Michelle.
I'm sick of your snarky comments.

953
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.708
It's my job. don't you get it?
Are you stupid or what?

954
01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:04.958
-Go easy. girl.
-Why?

955
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.416
Hold me. I'll give her a fat lip.
What did you say?

956
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.875
-Say it again.
-Stupid.

957
01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.875
-Don't yell!
-Listen to me…

958
01:04:10.958 --> 01:04:12.041
Hey. ladies!

959
01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:15.541
You can be mad all you want.
I'm not afraid to get into it with you.

960
01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:17.416
Geez. you guys are friends.

961
01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:24.916
Why did we come here after all?

962
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.958
Because of my Instagram.

963
01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.416
-That wasn't my question.
-Idiot.

964
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.166
But your answer says a lot. Nina.

965
01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:34.666
-I don't get it.
-And I'm the stupid one.

966
01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.125
-What did I do?
-Your guest is here.

967
01:04:52.916 --> 01:04:56.208
-Excuse me. How are you?
-Hi. Nina.

968
01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.291
-I'm gonna get going.
-Yes. Jorge. please. And sort it out.

969
01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:02.458
-Okay. Excuse me.
-Call me if you need me.

970
01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:04.916
-Hi.
-Come here. I want to talk to you.

971
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.291
Come here.

972
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.166
Tell me. from the bottom of your heart.
do you like Salvador?

973
01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:13.375
-Why?
-Why what?

974
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.625
-What do you mean?
-Salvador.

975
01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:16.583
Yeah. I mean…

976
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.250
The city.

977
01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.333
-What did you think I meant?
-Nothing. I was…

978
01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:23.041
It's beautiful!

979
01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:27.166
It's my first time here.
and I feel like I have roots here.

980
01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:29.666
Salvador…

981
01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:32.958
is really captivating me.

982
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:35.083
Salvador does that to everyone.

983
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.708
And my love for you

984
01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:42.250
Is summer and spring

985
01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:45.583
Even if the whole world is against us

986
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.875
Let's keep sailing together

987
01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.458
-You remember. Freddy?
-See?

988
01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:54.583
Nina. you have no idea. These words--

989
01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.541
I have an idea. Let's go to my studio.

990
01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:07.541
I want to introduce you to Cris.
the owner of my record label.

991
01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:09.000
-Shall we?
-Sure.

992
01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:11.000
Hey. Cris. come here for a second.

993
01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:14.291
I want to introduce you
to a very special person.

994
01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:15.291
Come here.

995
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.916
-Nina. Cris. Cris. Nina.
-Nice to meet you.

996
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.041
Now that you've been introduced.
I want to show you a dope new song. man.

997
01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:28.583
Okay? Thank you. man.

998
01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:30.416
Let's do it. Cris.

999
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.625
No one's allowed.

1000
01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:35.500
-But it's me!
-No one.

1001
01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:41.833
You. come here.

1002
01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:03.666
What's up? Are you okay?

1003
01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:15.125
No way. No one can stop me.
That's how I roll.

1004
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:19.208
Michelle. I need to talk to you.
It's urgent. Come on.

1005
01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:21.500
Michelle. now.

1006
01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.500
-Michelle.
-She's out of it.

1007
01:07:23.583 --> 01:07:26.333
-Sorry. she'll be right back.
-Completely out of it.

1008
01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:28.375
Isn't this drink warm already?

1009
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:33.416
Let me get another one for you.
Sir! Thank you.

1010
01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:36.416
-He only had water.
-Oh. really?

1011
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.583
Hey. Instagram Girl.

1012
01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:42.333
go back to your Boomerangs.

1013
01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:45.708
-For God's sake. leave me alone.
-Michelle. I mean it.

1014
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:48.541
You drank too much.
You're hitting on anyone with a pulse.

1015
01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:54.541
So now you're gonna control me
and criticize what I do.

1016
01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:58.041
Oh. that's right.
I forgot she can do anything.

1017
01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.541
She's paying for everything.

1018
01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:01.916
She's the queen of Instagram

1019
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.166
and can do whatever she wants.

1020
01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:10.000
Michelle! I'm just asking you
to get it together. okay?

1021
01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:12.833
What are you trying to do? Embarrass me?

1022
01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:16.208
You act so superior.

1023
01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.000
You know what you should do?

1024
01:08:18.083 --> 01:08:21.125
Go to hell.
and don't forget to ping your location.

1025
01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:24.833
Michelle!

1026
01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:30.708
-Guys. I killed the man.
-You didn't mean to.

1027
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.500
Freddy. tell us what happened.

1028
01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:39.708
-Please. an interview.
-I don't think it's too serious.

1029
01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:41.916
Are you two dating? Are you in love?

1030
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:42.916
What?

1031
01:08:43.458 --> 01:08:45.000
With this lady. Nina.

1032
01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:48.250
Of course. Nina is my muse.

1033
01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:51.375
-Talk to us.
-Nina. how is the relationship going?

1034
01:08:51.458 --> 01:08:53.250
We're just getting to know each other.

1035
01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:57.375
but I can say we're having
a wonderful time together.

1036
01:08:57.458 --> 01:08:59.666
-That's right.
-Guys. Luana is here.

1037
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:01.750
Luana. did you see what happened?

1038
01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:04.583
-Hi.
-Luana. did you witness the accident?

1039
01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:07.875
Excuse me.
I have no patience for amateurs.

1040
01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:12.291
I was there. guys. Nothing happened.

1041
01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:15.166
They were just being gay
about the whole thing.

1042
01:09:16.833 --> 01:09:20.416
But if she was a little bit fatter.
she would've killed him.

1043
01:09:21.208 --> 01:09:22.416
Hey!

1044
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:26.250
Ladies. I have some great news for you.

1045
01:09:26.333 --> 01:09:29.625
Actually. I'd say it's wonderful!

1046
01:09:29.708 --> 01:09:31.375
My God!

1047
01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:33.875
What happened. Nina?

1048
01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:36.750
810.000 followers!

1049
01:09:37.958 --> 01:09:39.166
Just tell us. Salvador.

1050
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:43.125
Well. Freddy Nunes invited you guys

1051
01:09:43.208 --> 01:09:46.708
to be on the trio elétrico tonight.

1052
01:10:01.166 --> 01:10:04.625
Geez. man! What is all this?

1053
01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:06.708
I'm sure they brought it
to the wrong room.

1054
01:10:06.791 --> 01:10:08.291
What is all this?

1055
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.166
No. wait.

1056
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.333
I need to make a story about these gifts.

1057
01:10:14.416 --> 01:10:16.666
-I'll just check them out.
-I want the makeup.

1058
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:19.041
-They are gorgeous.
-Look. this one is so me.

1059
01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:25.000
Luana Di Sertanzo. the digital influencer.
lost many of her contracts.

1060
01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:26.791
It was just a comment.

1061
01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:30.416
Gays and fatties can blacken my image.

1062
01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:33.833
Geez. you guys got it all wrong.

1063
01:10:33.916 --> 01:10:38.041
I didn't say "blacken"
in the Black sense of the word. okay?

1064
01:10:38.125 --> 01:10:43.333
-It'd be as bad as talking about Jews.
-Luana makes fatphobic and racist remarks.

1065
01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.958
Hey. wait! I'm still talking!

1066
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:49.958
I mean. what the hell?
Jews aren't even Black!

1067
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.000
It's just that…

1068
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.166
Guys. you know what?

1069
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.875
Let's just delete the whole thing. okay?

1070
01:10:57.958 --> 01:11:00.875
That's why women can't drink like men.

1071
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.791
LIGHTHOUSE SQUARE

1072
01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:38.458
I thought the van would drop us off
close to the trio.

1073
01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:40.416
You'll have to walk from here.

1074
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.333
Freddy's security team
will help you get there. okay?

1075
01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:45.958
Tonight. Freddy's a guest
on Durval Lélys' trio elétrico.

1076
01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:47.000
You have to hurry.

1077
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:49.250
-Then let's go.
-Come on.

1078
01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:53.625
Three. two. one…

1079
01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:57.166
Happy New Year!

1080
01:11:57.833 --> 01:11:58.875
Mayra.

1081
01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:00.416
Mayra?

1082
01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:02.250
Mayra?

1083
01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:09.291
It's okay.

1084
01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:12.208
I'm right here. You can trust me.

1085
01:12:14.958 --> 01:12:17.166
Did you get lost from your parents?

1086
01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:20.833
Give me your hand.

1087
01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:28.000
We are gonna be
on Durval's trio elétrico. Mayra.

1088
01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.208
Can you believe it?

1089
01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:32.666
Come with me. It's gonna be okay.

1090
01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:38.916
Come on. Freddy. Let's go.

1091
01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:42.541
Ladies. let's line up over here.
Come on. Freddy.

1092
01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:44.083
Hi.

1093
01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:45.833
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

1094
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:48.916
-Bye. Salvador. Thank you.
-Have fun.

1095
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:50.750
Come on.

1096
01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:07.708
-Stop pushing me.
-Guys. hold on.

1097
01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:09.833
Nina. don't let go of my hand.

1098
01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:41.250
Girl. don't let go.

1099
01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:44.291
-Mayra. don't let go.
-Hey. hold on.

1100
01:13:44.375 --> 01:13:45.666
Nina!

1101
01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.000
Help me. Nina!

1102
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:51.666
Michelle!

1103
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.416
Nina!

1104
01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:55.458
The girls!

1105
01:13:55.541 --> 01:13:59.333
Here comes the Carnival champion.

1106
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:02.916
The rhythm that will shake the world.

1107
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.416
The girls!

1108
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.000
Now. here they are.
Freddy Nunes and Durvalino!

1109
01:14:09.791 --> 01:14:11.875
Get up here. brother.

1110
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.291
Come here.

1111
01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:17.333
-Come!
-Don't let go of my hand!

1112
01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:19.166
Girl. come on!

1113
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.666
Come on. Mayra!

1114
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:25.000
This girl is smart as hell

1115
01:14:25.083 --> 01:14:26.541
Black belt. hard mode…

1116
01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.041
Where are you. Nina? Come here.

1117
01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:32.791
She's a hit on Insta
Has over a thousand likes

1118
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:36.208
She posts pics twerking
Please don't stop

1119
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:41.291
Does it feel good? Go down

1120
01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:45.208
Getting intimate with the floor
Getting intimate with the booty

1121
01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:46.875
Does it feel good?

1122
01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.875
A special kiss to Nina!

1123
01:14:48.958 --> 01:14:50.625
Hi. my princess!

1124
01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:53.375
I’m so glad you're here!

1125
01:14:53.458 --> 01:14:55.750
Go down

1126
01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:58.125
-Homophobic!
-Get outta there!

1127
01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:01.375
BIGOT - LUANA IS SEXIST
RACISTS ARE NOT ALLOWED

1128
01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:04.041
-Come on down. You're a phony!
-Fascist!

Does it feel good…

1132
01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:20.583
Mayra!

Getting intimate with the floor
Getting intimate with the booty…

1134
01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:05.666
Good evening. Excuse me.
My friend is lost!

1135
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.541
Sweetie. look around. Everyone is lost.

1136
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:11.541
I really need to find my friend. sir.
She's all alone.

1137
01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:14.458
Take another look.
She is definitely not alone.

1138
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.583
Relax. no reason to be upset.

1139
01:16:50.666 --> 01:16:54.166
Fear is like faith backwards.

1140
01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.708
Don't let fear control you anymore.

1141
01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:02.208
We are under heavy protection.

1142
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:16.166
Be thankful and have trust.

1143
01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:27.375
Wait a minute.
Aren't you Freddy Nunes' girlfriend?

1144
01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:30.375
Santos. come here.
Let's take a picture with her.

1145
01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:31.416
We can do that later.

1146
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.916
Can you please take me
to Durval's trio elétrico?

1147
01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:46.791
Freddy.

1148
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.541
I can explain.

1149
01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:53.875
Go ahead. explain.

1150
01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:57.458
-Guys. look. I don't--
-I'll explain. then.

1151
01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:04.375
What you just saw here

1152
01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:09.458
was a gay event producer
trying to force himself on his artist.

1153
01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:14.541
You're being ironic.

1154
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:17.000
Just so you can keep being a coward.

1155
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:21.541
We shouldn't have
this conversation like this.

1156
01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:22.458
"We"?

1157
01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:23.875
Yes.

1158
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.208
-Please.
-What do you mean by "we"?

1159
01:18:27.708 --> 01:18:29.125
It's always only been "you."

1160
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:32.625
Your career. your fans.

1161
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.125
That's it.

1162
01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:39.041
And during your off hours.
in hiding. of course.

1163
01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:41.750
you had this moron here.

1164
01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:44.000
What did you want me to do?

1165
01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:48.500
Come out?

1166
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.208
Is that it?

1167
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.958
Coming out to yourself
would be enough. Freddy.

1168
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:21.708
-I'm sorry. Nina.
-Freddy…

1169
01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:25.291
You don't have to apologize.

1170
01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:31.041
Go after your happiness.

1171
01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:34.208
Just do that.

1172
01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:42.458
Keep sailing. remember?

1173
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:45.958
Be brave.

1174
01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:55.916
I know this isn't the best time.

1175
01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:01.916
but I really need your help
to find my friends.

1176
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.416
-Of course.
-Please.

1177
01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:08.875
Vivi? Where are you?

1178
01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:12.375
Tell me. please.
I'm going crazy trying to find you guys.

1179
01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:15.041
I called Michelle. but she didn't pick up.

1180
01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:17.833
I tried texting Mayra.
but she doesn't reply.

1181
01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:20.750
Please. where are you guys?

1182
01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:41.666
No one.

1183
01:20:43.166 --> 01:20:44.750
Where to now. Ms. Nina?

1184
01:20:53.833 --> 01:20:56.083
Believe in your destiny.

1185
01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:58.625
Trust the power
of life-changing experiences.

1186
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.208
All you need is courage

1187
01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:05.250
to be who you really are.

1188
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:09.041
Nina. you didn't post
our picture from yesterday?

1189
01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:12.333
That's all she cares about.
She wants likes and stuff.

1190
01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:13.625
It's what she wants.

1191
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.500
I won't let go of your hand.

1192
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:18.708
no matter what.

1193
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:25.208
In your quest to conquer it all.

1194
01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:29.250
you might lose what you really love.

1195
01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:39.458
Guys. I know I've been doing this live
for a really long time.

1196
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:42.708
but I don't know what else to do
to find my friends.

1197
01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:45.291
I posted many stories. I tagged them…

1198
01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.458
Marcão?

1199
01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:49.416
Is that you?

1200
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.625
Marcão. you know what?

1201
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.375
MARCAOMARCAO JOINED

1202
01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:55.583
You were right.

1203
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:00.333
I would never understand you.

1204
01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:05.791
Your new CrossFit girlfriend
must be way cooler

1205
01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:08.583
and much more sensitive than me.

1206
01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:10.625
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. BUT I AGREE

1207
01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.583
Don't agree with me! You were an asshole!

1208
01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:15.250
Michelle!

1209
01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:18.458
Talk to me. Michelle. please.

1210
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:21.666
Say anything.
Tell me to fuck off. but talk to me.

1211
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:22.583
"Fuck…"

1212
01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:26.500
Gosh. you don't need
to talk to me like that. I'm sorry.

1213
01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:30.916
I messed up. I know. But I was blind.

1214
01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:32.833
I love you.

1215
01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:34.833
Mayra!

1216
01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.041
My soul sister.

1217
01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:38.916
Please. forgive me.

1218
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:41.750
I'm so sorry.

1219
01:22:41.833 --> 01:22:47.166
I swear. I promise
that I'll never let go of your hand again.

1221
01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:51.541
Vivi! You guys are all on this livestream
and no one says anything?

1222
01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:54.125
Guys. say something. please!

1223
01:22:55.416 --> 01:22:56.916
"What's the meaning of life?"

1224
01:22:57.833 --> 01:22:59.208
What's the meaning of life?

1225
01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:03.208
I know the answer. Vivi.

1226
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:06.083
The meaning of life…

1227
01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:10.750
is having friends just like you guys.

1228
01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:12.791
That's the meaning of life.

1229
01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:15.916
Did I get it right?

1230
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.750
No. but I like your answer.
so I'll take it.

1231
01:23:22.916 --> 01:23:25.791
Girls. please forgive me.

1232
01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:28.041
-Of course. girl.
-I'll let it slide this time.

1233
01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:33.916
This is real!

1234
01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.750
Wait. I need to do something.

1235
01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:39.166
-Look at that. You say I'm annoying.
-Not again.

1236
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.916
That's so sweet!

1237
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.291
You did have to post this one.

1238
01:23:56.625 --> 01:24:00.250
1 MILLION FOLLOWERS

1239
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:25.625
Luana?

1240
01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:31.666
They hate me. They want me dead.

1241
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:34.375
Who are "they"? Are you crazy?

1242
01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:39.375
Gay people. Black people. fat people.
Maybe even the indigenous people.

1243
01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:41.041
Why did you say all that?

1244
01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:45.500
Because I had no one around to tell me
that it was wrong. No friends.

1245
01:24:46.458 --> 01:24:48.083
It would've made a big difference.

1246
01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:51.166
These were my best friends back in school.

1247
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500
Ironic. isn't it?

1248
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:55.875
Where are they now?

1249
01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:59.041
Look for them. Send them a message.

1250
01:25:00.875 --> 01:25:04.958
Friends are the most important thing
in life.

1251
01:25:05.041 --> 01:25:05.875
Good idea.

1252
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.041
I'm gonna try to find them.

1253
01:25:10.416 --> 01:25:11.375
But first…

1254
01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.333
What are you doing?

1255
01:25:13.416 --> 01:25:15.750
Are you deleting your profile?
Don't do that.

1256
01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:18.500
First. I need to find myself.

1257
01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:19.958
Thank you.

1258
01:25:20.541 --> 01:25:22.083
You're a great influencer.

1259
01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.291
-You look great.
-You too.

1260
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:36.041
Look. it's Ronaldo.

1261
01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:40.291
Oh my God!

1262
01:25:40.375 --> 01:25:41.791
Two Ronaldos?

1263
01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:44.833
Hey! You two! Yeah. you two.

1264
01:25:44.916 --> 01:25:46.291
Oh. God.

1265
01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:48.958
Okay. this one.

1266
01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:57.583
She's gonna kiss the other one.
She did it.

1267
01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:58.666
Wait.

1268
01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:04.458
Girls. this is Ronaldo.

1269
01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:07.666
And this one is the counterfeit.

1270
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.791
-Hi. girls.
-Hi!

1271
01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:11.875
-Counterfeit?
-You could've told me.

1272
01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.083
-Hey!
-Hi!

1273
01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:15.625
-Hi. What's up?
-Hi. Samir.

1274
01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:19.500
Today. we'll be attending
a private concert.

1275
01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:21.875
-Awesome!
-Count me in.

1276
01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:23.416
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

1277
01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:27.833
-Hi.
-Hi.

1278
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.125
You know what? I'm loving love.

1279
01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:39.541
Wow. Vivi. you look so…

1280
01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:42.166
so different.

1281
01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.333
What? Are you judging a book by its cover?

1282
01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:48.791
No. I'm just saying you look beautiful.

1283
01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:50.375
That you are beautiful.

1284
01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:51.708
Oh. okay.

1285
01:26:54.833 --> 01:26:55.791
Let's go.

1286
01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.416
I…

1287
01:26:58.416 --> 01:27:01.583
I got caught up
in this whole social media stuff. but…

1288
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.458
That's why I always dive right in.

1289
01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:08.291
I don't make stories. I live stories.

1290
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.250
Nina. the only filter I use
is the water filter to quench my thirst.

1291
01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:15.166
because people from Bahia are--

1292
01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:35.208
Good afternoon. beautiful people.

1293
01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:38.625
Thank you for coming.

1294
01:27:40.416 --> 01:27:43.958
I said that Nina was my muse.

1295
01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:47.666
I mean. she is.
Just look at her and her beautiful smile.

1296
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:49.916
She has such a great vibe.

1297
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:51.458
Thank you. Nina.

1298
01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:53.708
I'm lucky to have met you.

1299
01:27:55.291 --> 01:27:58.791
She made me understand
that in order to love. we need courage.

1300
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:01.833
"Keep sailing." remember?

1301
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:04.458
That's why this next song

1302
01:28:05.208 --> 01:28:06.791
is for you.

1303
01:28:08.875 --> 01:28:09.708
Do it.

1304
01:28:12.458 --> 01:28:13.375
Jorge.

1305
01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:16.708
Come here. silly.

1306
01:28:20.083 --> 01:28:21.750
You go. Jorge!

1307
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.958
It's for you.

1308
01:28:29.291 --> 01:28:31.125
My love for you

1309
01:28:31.208 --> 01:28:34.125
Is summer and spring

1310
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:40.041
Even if the whole world is against us
Let's keep sailing together

1311
01:28:40.125 --> 01:28:42.541
My love for you

1312
01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:45.208
Is summer and spring

1313
01:28:45.791 --> 01:28:50.750
Even if the whole world is against us
Our love always reigns

1314
01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:56.041
I wasted so much time
Trying to explain to the world

1315
01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:58.625
That my love is you

1316
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.166
But unfortunately
The world can't understand the heart

1317
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.125
You know when I'm fine

1318
01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:08.500
You get me at first glance

1319
01:29:09.166 --> 01:29:13.208
And when I'm a pain
I don't have to say a word…

1320
01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:16.041
Nina. I love Freddy.

1321
01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:19.291
but Carnival is almost over.
and Yemoja is calling me. Bye.

1322
01:29:20.458 --> 01:29:22.541
You and I

1323
01:29:23.208 --> 01:29:25.375
You and I

1324
01:29:25.458 --> 01:29:28.125
And there's nothing that can explain us

1325
01:29:28.208 --> 01:29:30.958
Loving has no explanation

1326
01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:33.666
It's a connection

1327
01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:36.166
A connection…

1328
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:38.916
-I love you.
-And I have always loved you.

1329
01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:42.375
You're nuts.

1330
01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:51.250
You guys are amazing!

1331
01:29:52.916 --> 01:29:56.333
-You are everything to me.
-I love you guys!

1332
01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.916
Best friends forever.

1333
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.583
I love you guys!

1334
01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:06.291
Girls! Best Carnival ever!

1335
01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:08.000
I love you guys!

1336
01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:13.625
You. me. and our love

1337
01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:19.916
It's you and me. and that's it

1338
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.750
THE END
