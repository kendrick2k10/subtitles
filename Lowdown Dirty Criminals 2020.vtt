00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:32.656
<i>Have you ever had
one of those days</i>

5
00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:35.352
<i>where everything
just turns to shit?</i>

6
00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:37.855
<i>This is one of those.</i>

7
00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:40.457
<i>I'm Freddy. by the way.</i>

8
00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.628
<i>This is The Upholsterer.</i>

9
00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.464
<i>She doesn't just cut up foam
and leather and shit.</i>

10
00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:50.735
<i>I've seen the real reason she's
called what she's called.</i>

11
00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:52.770
<i>This is Mr Spiggs.</i>

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.840
<i>Once upon a time.
I thought he was cool.</i>

13
00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:57.942
<i>This is Semo.</i>

14
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.477
<i>In another life.
we might have been mates.</i>

15
00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:01.779
<i>Not today.</i>

16
00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:03.447
<i>This is Roy.</i>

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.583
<i>The dude must be on meth
cos he's psycho.</i>

18
00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:10.655
<i>I'm here for this fulla...
my boy Marvin.</i>

19
00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:12.456
<i>I've known him forever.</i>

20
00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.391
<i>and we'd do anything
for each other.</i>

21
00:01:15.026 --> 00:01:17.561
<i>Which is why I'm here
with a gun in each hand</i>

22
00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:19.329
<i>and a naked Samoan.</i>

23
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.333
Semo. how did Freddy
get a gun?

24
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.368
And why can I see
your genitals?

25
00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:27.237
- Fucking Roy's fault.
- Eh?

26
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.575
<i>I'm pretty sure I know
what you're thinking.</i>

27
00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.879
<i>and if I wasn't concentrating
so hard on what to do next.</i>

28
00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:37.314
<i>I'd be thinking
the same thing.</i>

29
00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:41.485
<i>How the hell did we
end up in this mess?</i>

30
00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.320
<i>Good question.</i>

31
00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:52.730
<i>This is where it all started.</i>

32
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.734
<i>It was a simple job.
just pick up a cake.</i>

33
00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:02.472
<i>But me and Marv.
we had big ideas.</i>

34
00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.812
We've got his cake.
That's all we had to do. right?

35
00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.049
I think we should do it.

36
00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:14.952
- What. bail?
- Nah. This.

37
00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.821
Don't you think?

38
00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.892
Nah. yeah. bro. like I said.
we're here now. so...

39
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.059
Exactly.

40
00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:26.931
When we pull off maybe
a couple of others like this.

41
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.499
he has to take notice of us.

42
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.368
This is how we get a rep.

43
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.939
And then we. like. move on up
to the real money. bro.

44
00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:38.943
Like. you know. this is how
Barry and Dean got started.

45
00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.012
Dude. they get a cut
of whatever they sell.

46
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.647
Fuckers are totally
rolling in it.

47
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:45.615
That's where we wanna be.

48
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.984
Right?

49
00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.485
High on the hog.

50
00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.353
Hells yeah. bro.

51
00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.722
High on the hog!

52
00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.831
<i>Whoa. whoa. hold up.</i>

53
00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:02.532
<i>Actually. when you
really think about it.</i>

54
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.601
<i>this isn't where
it all started.</i>

55
00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.038
<i>Check us out
looking all staunch.</i>

56
00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:10.041
<i>Truth is we're about
to shit our pants.</i>

Oh.

62
00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:55.452
- Pizza?
- Awesome.

63
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.021
Cash or card?

64
00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:58.856
Oh. nah. you were more
than 20 minutes.

65
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.557
so that means it's free.

66
00:04:01.092 --> 00:04:04.095
- But I'm not late.
- 21 minutes. Sorry.

67
00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:05.562
No.

68
00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:08.498
But I still don't have it.

69
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.968
so that means you are late.
so... can I...?

70
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.970
<i>Everything OK. hon?</i>

71
00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:17.141
Are you gonna give me
my pizza or what?

72
00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:20.011
Well. it's timed from
order to door.

73
00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:21.779
No money. no pizza.

74
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.458
Stop doing that.
I don't like it.

75
00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:37.527
- What?
- Fuck off. you perv.

76
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.664
Whoa. bro. I'm not
doing anything to you.

77
00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:41.732
You're undressing me
with your eyes.

78
00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:44.201
<i>What's going on. babe?
I'm hungry.</i>

79
00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:46.603
He's undressing me
with his eyes.

80
00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:49.674
- That's not cool. brother.
- Hey.

81
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:51.976
Can I just get my $19.50.
please?

82
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.444
- He's still doing it.
- He is too.

83
00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.949
- You're a little skank!
- I'm not!

84
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:00.885
He's undressing you now.
babe.

85
00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:02.585
You little tart.

86
00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.189
- You're unbelievable!
- Oh. come on.

87
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.024
You know what.
pizza's on me.

88
00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:09.060
Oi!

89
00:05:09.093 --> 00:05:10.061
Get him. babe!

90
00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.562
- Get him! Smash him!
- Oi! You little shit!

91
00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:15.498
Oh. meat lovers.

92
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.002
- Hey. get back here!
- Fuck!

93
00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:20.738
OK. oi!

94
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:21.806
- Leave it!
- Shit!

95
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.074
That's disrespectful!

96
00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:24.008
Come here!

97
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.276
Come here! Come here!

98
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.078
Oh. playing hide and seek?

99
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:29.046
Hey. unlock the door.

100
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.048
Oi!

101
00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:32.917
<i>C'mon. cuz.</i>

102
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.919
Shit.

103
00:05:35.786 --> 00:05:37.121
Shit.

104
00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.157
Hey. boss.

105
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.826
- Eh?
- I can see you.

106
00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.862
Nah. nah. nah. he lied
so he didn't have to pay.

107
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:47.564
Oh. shit!
You prick!

108
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.033
No. not you.

109
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:50.868
No. I wasn't late.

110
00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.270
What noise?

111
00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.173
- What. bring in the car?
- Why'd you be like that?!

112
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.618
Hey. Glen.

113
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.988
Is. um...?

114
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:13.958
Cool.

115
00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:56.967
I'm...

116
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:58.635
I'm over it. bro.

117
00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:03.908
I work as many hours
as anyone else.

118
00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:08.611
but I'm always broke.
It's all just...

119
00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:11.648
Bullshit.

120
00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:20.324
Now.

121
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:22.693
we've always said

122
00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:24.829
one day

123
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.864
we'd be high on the hog...

124
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.301
moneys and honeys.

125
00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.737
Still can be.

126
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:35.339
How?

127
00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:40.177
Oh.

128
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.012
Nah.

129
00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:44.181
I'm already in the door.
bro.

130
00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:45.382
You could be too.

131
00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:46.917
Not happening.

132
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.220
Nobody who ever worked
an honest job

133
00:07:49.253 --> 00:07:51.055
ever got high on the hog.

134
00:07:51.088 --> 00:07:54.158
It's been. like.
scientifically proven. bro.

135
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.893
Dude's a player.

136
00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:58.362
The real deal.

137
00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:03.868
So. you know.

138
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.069

Marvin tells me you've got

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.293
previous experience
working in bars.

150
00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:05.095
Freddy and me worked together
in this...

151
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:08.766
Sorry.

152
00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.902
Tell me. why the fuck you
wanna work here for?

153
00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:13.337
Uh...

154
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.373
Well. Marvin said
you paid good. and...

155
00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.976
I'm sick of being broke.

156
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.013
And I don't wanna be delivering
pizzas forever.

157
00:09:23.047 --> 00:09:24.415
I want more. you know.

158
00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:33.090
In prison camps

159
00:09:34.024 --> 00:09:36.393
in the American Civil War.

160
00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:39.196
there was a line.

161
00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:42.399
and if a prisoner crossed
that line.

162
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:45.202
he was shot.

163
00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:48.472
That line was called
a deadline.

164
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.474
I always liked that word.

165
00:09:51.475 --> 00:09:53.177
Deadline.

166
00:09:56.046 --> 00:09:58.082
Meaning's changed since.

167
00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:00.818
But with some deadlines.
there's always a risk

168
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.519
that once you cross over it.

169
00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:05.289
you may never come back.

170
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.501
You want a job?

171
00:10:19.503 --> 00:10:21.171
You convince me.

172
00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:25.909
You got 10 seconds.

173
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.980
Nine.

174
00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:31.148
- Um...
- Eight.

175
00:10:31.181 --> 00:10:32.449
Wait. what do you want
me to do?

176
00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:34.218
Seven.

177
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:35.586
Six.

178
00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:36.887
Five.

179
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.222
Four.

180
00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:40.457
Three. Two.

181
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:46.797
Ooh.

182
00:10:47.264 --> 00:10:48.999
One.

183
00:10:57.941 --> 00:10:59.410
Is it loaded. Freddy?

184
00:11:00.177 --> 00:11:01.879
This gun loaded. Freddy?

185
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.113
N-No. no. no!

186
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.252
Pulls a bit to the left.

187
00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:16.427
Something I should know
about you. Freddy?

188
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.395
A pizza guy was

189
00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:20.431
robbed a while back.

190
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.466
So now I use that...

191
00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:24.001
as protection.

192
00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:28.205
It's my dad's.

193
00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:30.974
Does he know
that you've got it?

194
00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:36.447
Nah.

195
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.316
You stole your old man's gun?

196
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:42.186
Well.

197
00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:43.554
it was....

198
00:11:43.587 --> 00:11:46.490
you know.
left to me. so...

199
00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:49.626
He got. like. attacked

200
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:51.061
on the job.

201
00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:53.530
He drove cabs.

202
00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:55.299
Attacked?

203
00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.268
Stabbed. actually.

204
00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:12.116
You know. I think there
might be a place for you

205
00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.951
and your little gun

206
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.388
in this fine
establishment of mine.

207
00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:20.023
What do you say?

208
00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:26.063
<i>Right here.
Pretty safe to say that</i>

209
00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.298
<i>right here is where
the whole mess began.</i>

210
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:30.367
<i>I should have said.
"Can I think about it?"</i>

211
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:33.404
<i>But I wanted into that world.
so I was all like....</i>

212
00:12:33.437 --> 00:12:35.105
"Hells yeah. Mr Spiggs!"

213
00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:37.141
<i>♪ The things that
you want to do ♪</i>

214
00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:40.344
<i>♪ I know something is up ♪</i>

215
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:42.379
<i>♪ Something ♪</i>

216
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:48.552
<i>Awesome.
Now we're all caught up.</i>

217
00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:54.358
<i>Let's get back to the alley.</i>

218
00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:56.927
<i>the car
and that bloody cake.</i>

219
00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.201
No way.

220
00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:06.270
- Why not?
- It's a shit idea.

221
00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:08.238
Let's just stick to the plan.
OK?

222
00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:10.140
Let's go. Open it.

223
00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:12.209
Is that a flare gun?

224
00:13:13.177 --> 00:13:14.111
N-No.

225
00:13:14.746 --> 00:13:15.713
Open it.

226
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:18.449
Wait. wait. wait.
Wait. nah. nah.

227
00:13:18.482 --> 00:13:19.483
- Nah. hold on.
- What are you doing?

228
00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:22.085
Put it up.
We can't show weakness.

229
00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:24.321
Bro. how much
is in the till?

230
00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:27.257
Three-hundred cash.
give or take.

231
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:29.193
And how much is in that?

232
00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:32.062
Thousands.
Maybe tens of thousands.

233
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.700
See. bro.
tens of thousands.

234
00:13:35.733 --> 00:13:37.634
Rob the ATM?

235
00:13:39.203 --> 00:13:40.137
How?

236
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.509
- Can you open it?
- Only the security company can.

237
00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.044
Let's just take
the three-hundy.

238
00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.579
Bro. why settle for peanuts

239
00:13:48.612 --> 00:13:51.148
when we can just rip
it out of the wall?

240
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:52.684
- Dude. you can't.
- Yeah. you can.

241
00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:55.352
YouTube...
I've seen these epic fails

242
00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:58.589
with dudes trying to do it.
and... it just can't be done.

243
00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:00.792
Yeah. but did they
have a Sharon?

244
00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:03.160
- What?
- The Shazza.

245
00:14:04.762 --> 00:14:06.029
Oh. the...

246
00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:08.332
That's the second
dumbest idea

247
00:14:08.365 --> 00:14:09.466
you've ever had.

248
00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:12.169
- Listen to me. man.
- Seriously. bro.

249
00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:13.537
- Look...
- Seriously!

250
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.239
- One scratch on her...
- Oh. bro. it's OK.

251
00:14:15.272 --> 00:14:16.507
- ...he'll kill us!
- It's OK!

252
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.743
- No fucking way in hell!
- That's...

253
00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.813
Whatever damage
we do to the Sharon.

254
00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:24.147
we can fix
using the ATM cash.

255
00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:27.417
And think about it.
what's gonna impress him more...

256
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:31.054
robbing a place like this
or robbing a bank?

257
00:14:31.355 --> 00:14:32.657
Kind of.

258
00:14:35.092 --> 00:14:36.661
And. dude.

259
00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:38.262
you can put your
hands down now.

260
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:42.199
- You got a family?
- Yes.

261
00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:43.701
- Kids?
- Six.

262
00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:45.737
- Damn!
- Seriously?

263
00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:47.371
Wow.

264
00:14:47.805 --> 00:14:50.207
And. what.
if we steal from you.

265
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.210
they'll be left with nothing
but 2 Minute Noodles. right?

266
00:14:53.243 --> 00:14:54.511
Noodles if they're lucky.

267
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:57.314
See. bro?
Think of the kids.

268
00:14:58.215 --> 00:15:00.050
Oh man.

269
00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:04.321
- Fine.
- Yes!

270
00:15:04.354 --> 00:15:06.490
But I'm not leaving without
that crazy elephant.

271
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.667
- Dude. stop! The cake!
- Huh?

272
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.134
<i>The cake!</i>

273
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:18.770
Oh. yeah.

274
00:15:33.216 --> 00:15:35.218
Dude. we've gotta go.

275
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.688
We gotta go now!

276
00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:37.755
Yeah. yeah. hang on.

277
00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:41.425
What do you think this
looks like. a pool party?

278
00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:44.094
<i>They'll be calling the cops</i>

279
00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:46.396
right now!

280
00:15:58.342 --> 00:15:59.610
Oh. fuck.

281
00:15:59.643 --> 00:16:02.245
- One more time!
- <i>We gotta go. dude.</i>

282
00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.186
One more time!
One more time!

283
00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:11.889
Hey. whoa.

284
00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:13.190
What are you doing?
I've got this.

285
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.157
No. you don't.

286
00:16:14.993 --> 00:16:16.627
What? Well.
what about the money?

287
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:17.494
Fuck the money.

288
00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:19.296
Then how are we gonna
fix the Sharon?

289
00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:21.766
We?
This was your idea. bro.

290
00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:24.267
I told you!
YouTube. dude!

291
00:16:24.534 --> 00:16:26.536
YouTube!

292
00:16:26.838 --> 00:16:28.840
Bro. bro. bro.

293
00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:30.607
Stop! The cake. bro.
The cake.

294
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:32.542
Oh. shit.

295
00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:35.847
Whoa. whoa.

296
00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:51.528
Glory to Ganesha!

297
00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:55.432
Yeah. don't fuck in my
neighborhood. you bastards.

298
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.709
An ATM.

299
00:17:05.843 --> 00:17:07.444
Don't you watch YouTube?

300
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.381
Let's recap. shall we?

301
00:17:13.818 --> 00:17:16.353
You have. A. wrecked my car

302
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.890
and. B. wrecked my cake.

303
00:17:19.322 --> 00:17:23.193
which means that you have. C.
wrecked my birthday.

304
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.197
Could get another cake.

305
00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.499
Freddy.

306
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:32.904
dozens of my friends are in
there celebrating my birthday.

307
00:17:32.937 --> 00:17:34.939
Where am I gonna get
a cake at this hour that's

308
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:40.277
big enough so that each of them
can get a nice fat slice?

309
00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:42.914
Well. instead of
getting one cake.

310
00:17:42.947 --> 00:17:44.682
you could...

311
00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:46.751
- get a few cakes.
- Dude.

312
00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:49.619
What. the supermarket's
still open.

313
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:52.990
Supermarket cakes?

314
00:17:53.623 --> 00:17:55.559
Marvin and me can go
and get them.

315
00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:57.962
That cake took
days to make.

316
00:17:57.995 --> 00:18:00.597
and it cost me more money
than you've probably made

317
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.600
in your entire worthless
fucking life.

318
00:18:06.738 --> 00:18:09.372
It was a spectacular cake.
don't you think?

319
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.711
Now I can't enjoy that cake.

320
00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:15.947
Now I can't blow out
the candles

321
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.615
and I can't make a wish.

322
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.551
Guess what my wish
was gonna be.

323
00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:24.454
A new car?

324
00:18:34.598 --> 00:18:35.867
No.
We'll make it up to you.

325
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.567
Work-Work for free until we

326
00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:40.437
pay you back what we owe
for the cake and the Sharon.

327
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.811
I can't go back to my old job.
I don't want that life.

328
00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:49.513
That was my dad's life.
and he worked heaps

329
00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.749
and did everything right.

330
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.451
and look where it got him.

331
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.487
We wanna show you
what we're made of.

332
00:18:57.521 --> 00:19:00.658
Give us something
more than... than just...

333
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.292
picking up a cake.

334
00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:22.914
You know why I came to this city
at the ass end of nowhere?

335
00:19:22.947 --> 00:19:23.981
Love.

336
00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.585
That's my wife.

337
00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:34.091
- She's pretty.
- She's a whore.

338
00:19:39.664 --> 00:19:40.630
- Oh.
- Eh?

339
00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:42.066
She broke her vows.

340
00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:44.168
Yeah!

341
00:19:44.202 --> 00:19:46.003
Marriage is sacred...

342
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:48.706
sanctified.

343
00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:50.708
and she shat all over that.

344
00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:53.343
She went around
screwing some...

345
00:19:53.678 --> 00:19:56.379
prick called Donny Kong.

346
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:06.556
I want Donny dead.

347
00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:08.759
Dead.

348
00:20:08.893 --> 00:20:09.660
Dead!

349
00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:12.529
Dead! Dead! Dead!
Fucking dead!

350
00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:16.667
Fair enough.

351
00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:21.538
Now. I could get Barry
and Dean here

352
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:23.540
to take care of it for me.

353
00:20:23.573 --> 00:20:26.409
But why should they
get their hands dirty

354
00:20:26.443 --> 00:20:27.845
when I've got the two of you

355
00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:30.580
with a sweet little
debt to pay?

356
00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:34.384
And you did just say
you wanted to do something more.

357
00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:37.755
Freddy.

358
00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:39.456
what am I saying?

359
00:20:42.827 --> 00:20:44.729
What am I saying?

360
00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:47.832
That you. uh...

361
00:20:48.699 --> 00:20:50.668

like...

362
00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:51.969

363
00:20:52.703 --> 00:20:54.071
Marvin.

364
00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:56.207
what else am I saying?

365
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.675
That...

366
00:20:58.575 --> 00:21:00.011
you want us...

367
00:21:00.878 --> 00:21:02.545
to kill him.

368
00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:09.153
Now. Barry and Dean
will give you the address

369
00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:11.188
and anything else
you might need.

370
00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:12.990
and you'll do this by...

371
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:15.960
noon tomorrow.

372
00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:19.664
High noon.

373
00:21:19.964 --> 00:21:23.433
Yeah. I like that.
That's a good deadline.

374
00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:25.970
Dramatic.

375
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:31.108
Let me be crystal
fucking clear.

376
00:21:31.876 --> 00:21:32.810
You don't do this.

377
00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:35.112
and I'll have the boys here
give each of you

378
00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.881
a permanent limp...

379
00:21:37.514 --> 00:21:39.016
in both legs.

380
00:21:41.152 --> 00:21:42.853
Probably worse.

381
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:47.191
But you do do this.
and we'll be all square.

382
00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.459
Square as a bear.

383
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:52.129
So what's it gonna be?

384
00:21:52.697 --> 00:21:54.065
Square as a bear...

385
00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:56.867
or permanent limp?

386
00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:03.573
<i>Is that even possible?
To have a limp in both legs?</i>

387
00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:05.743
We are so fucked.

388
00:22:06.077 --> 00:22:07.244
Wouldn't...

389
00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:10.681
one limp. like.

390
00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:12.883
cancel out the other?

391
00:22:12.917 --> 00:22:14.919
Bro. we don't do this

392
00:22:15.618 --> 00:22:17.520
and we're in some deep shit.

393
00:22:17.554 --> 00:22:19.957
Maybe we just talk
to this Donny dude.

394
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:21.624
make him see reason.

395
00:22:22.994 --> 00:22:24.228
tell him why we're there

396
00:22:24.261 --> 00:22:26.529
and Spiggs knows
what's going on.

397
00:22:26.563 --> 00:22:29.532
so if he doesn't skip town.

398
00:22:29.566 --> 00:22:31.202
then he's a dead man.

399
00:22:31.568 --> 00:22:32.937
He disappears.

400
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.207
we go back and tell Spiggs
we took care of him...

401
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.908
all good.

402
00:22:41.846 --> 00:22:43.646
We could. like.

403
00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:45.615
break down the door

404
00:22:45.648 --> 00:22:48.185
and. like. put a gun in
his face and be. like.

405
00:22:48.219 --> 00:22:52.690
"Bro. leave town
or we're gonna fuck you up!"

406
00:22:56.193 --> 00:22:57.928
Yeah. nah.

407
00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:12.609
You know what he'd say.
don't you?

408
00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:17.114
"Where's my fucking beer.
boys?"

409
00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:20.251
"Straight and narrow. son."

410
00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.686
"Straight and narrow."

411
00:23:32.263 --> 00:23:33.898
Wanna end up like Glen?

412
00:23:34.932 --> 00:23:37.168
Breaking your back
for fuck all?

413
00:23:38.702 --> 00:23:42.039
This Donny dude is rooting
the boss' missus.

414
00:23:43.074 --> 00:23:44.708
And you heard Spiggs.

415
00:23:45.743 --> 00:23:47.778
Marriage is sanctimonious.

416
00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:51.115
We sort this Donny dude
for Spiggs

417
00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:55.686
and we'll be straight up
set for good. bro.

418
00:23:57.922 --> 00:23:59.824
High on the hog.

out of his anorexia!

541
00:31:31.275 --> 00:31:32.744
You guys shot the wrong man.
didn't you?!

542
00:31:32.777 --> 00:31:35.412
- Technically. he died before...
- Before you what?

543
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:36.547
We didn't actually shoot him.

544
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.482
You just said
that you fucking did.

545
00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:40.083
We just wanted you
to like us.

546
00:31:40.117 --> 00:31:41.518
We think it was
a heart attack.

547
00:31:41.552 --> 00:31:43.186
probably because of his size.

548
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.790
- And the situation.
- Yeah. The sitch.

549
00:31:55.532 --> 00:31:57.534
Whoa. whoa!

550
00:32:02.573 --> 00:32:04.575
Come here.
you little fucks!

551
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.485
Fuck it.

552
00:32:35.873 --> 00:32:38.141
- Where are you going. bro?
- It's OK.

553
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:41.378
Bro. where are you going?
Bro. come back.

554
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.548
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:48.820
Did you do anything
or say anything to anybody

556
00:32:48.853 --> 00:32:51.421
that would make it
even remotely possible

557
00:32:51.455 --> 00:32:55.325
to trace what happened
to the fat man back to me?

558
00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:57.361
Probably not.

559
00:32:57.662 --> 00:32:59.664
"Probably not."

560
00:33:00.631 --> 00:33:02.900
That's very reassuring. son.

561
00:33:02.934 --> 00:33:04.869
Nobody saw us. Mr Spiggs.

562
00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:11.508
Go back. get a name
for the fat man.

563
00:33:11.608 --> 00:33:14.177
Then I want you
to find Donny Kong

564
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.813
and finish the job.

565
00:33:17.547 --> 00:33:19.416
You got it?

566
00:33:19.784 --> 00:33:21.686
Of course. yeah.

567
00:33:22.352 --> 00:33:24.388
Until I have a name
for the fat man

568
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:27.825
and Donny is picking turnips
with a stepladder.

569
00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:29.927
then we're not square
as a bear.

570
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:32.897
Why would... Why would Donny
be picking turnips?

571
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.231
Dead. Freddy!
Dead!

572
00:33:34.264 --> 00:33:35.867
Cos he'd be fucking dead!

573
00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:37.935
Wait.

574
00:33:41.673 --> 00:33:43.675
You...

575
00:33:45.977 --> 00:33:50.313
<i>Now. as you know. Freddy.
the deadline's still noon.</i>

576
00:33:50.347 --> 00:33:53.383
<i>If you're not back by then.
I shoot Marvin's foot.</i>

577
00:33:54.284 --> 00:33:56.654
<i>Then every half hour
past noon.</i>

578
00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:58.522
<i>I'll shoot him again.</i>

579
00:33:59.589 --> 00:34:01.458
<i>I'll start with the other foot.</i>

580
00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:02.960
<i>work my way up to his knees...</i>

581
00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:06.263
<i>...his hands. and then...</i>

582
00:34:06.463 --> 00:34:07.699
<i>...ugh...</i>

583
00:34:08.598 --> 00:34:10.735
<i>...I'm sure you
get the picture.</i>

584
00:34:17.675 --> 00:34:20.477
I think he's in room 202.
but I'm not too sure.

585
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.747
Maybe you've got a register
with his name in it.

586
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.214
You a cop?

587
00:34:25.382 --> 00:34:26.650
I'm not a cop. really.

588
00:34:26.684 --> 00:34:28.753
- Are you sure you're not a cop?
- I'm not.

589
00:34:28.786 --> 00:34:30.888
- Cos you sound like a cop.
- I'm not.

590
00:34:30.922 --> 00:34:31.823
OK. well.
if you're not a cop.

591
00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:34.491
then why should I tell you
if your friend.

592
00:34:34.524 --> 00:34:37.028
if. in fact. he is your friend.
is in room 202?

593
00:34:37.061 --> 00:34:38.495
Is your mum
or dad here or...?

594
00:34:38.528 --> 00:34:40.564
- What's your friend's name?
- Um...

595
00:34:40.597 --> 00:34:42.700
His name.
Um...

596
00:34:42.734 --> 00:34:44.267
Funny thing is...

597
00:34:44.902 --> 00:34:47.337
I've actually forgotten
his name.

598
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.706
Oh. right.

599
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.908
B-B-But he's...
He's really large.

600
00:34:50.942 --> 00:34:51.843
Asian. I think.

601
00:34:51.876 --> 00:34:53.911
So you don't know
if your friend's Asian

602
00:34:53.945 --> 00:34:55.046
and you can't
remember his name?

603
00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:57.347
Room 202.
It's just a name.

604
00:34:57.782 --> 00:34:58.983
What's that say?

605
00:34:59.784 --> 00:35:02.486
- Do you know what it means?
- Um...

606
00:35:38.122 --> 00:35:39.924
Hello? Donny?

607
00:35:39.957 --> 00:35:42.960
Hello?

608
00:35:44.494 --> 00:35:46.329
<i>...We import
so much of our food.</i>

609
00:35:46.363 --> 00:35:47.965
<i>and all the time.
it's got to come up from the</i>

610
00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:50.367
<i>Northern Hemisphere; it's gotta
come from the warmer climates.</i>

611
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.003
<i>cos we're not very good
at growing stuff.</i>

612
00:36:18.896 --> 00:36:22.332
<i>Police.
Open the door. please.</i>

613
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.335
<i>Open the door.</i>

614
00:36:26.003 --> 00:36:28.005
Uh. just a second.

615
00:36:41.686 --> 00:36:44.554
Sorry. It was just kind of mess.
so...

616
00:36:44.856 --> 00:36:47.058
We got a call that someone
matching your description

617
00:36:47.091 --> 00:36:48.960
- broke in here.
- I didn't actually break in.

618
00:36:48.993 --> 00:36:50.761
Jeff left the door
open for me.

619
00:36:50.795 --> 00:36:52.395
Who the hell is Jeff?

620
00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:54.866
Jeff Kwok.
We're hooking up today.

621
00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:56.067
And he said to wait
here for him.

622
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.102
He's lying. I've never
heard of Jeff Kwok.

623
00:36:58.135 --> 00:37:01.504
Yeah. Jeff knows Donny.
and he's staying here.

624
00:37:01.538 --> 00:37:04.041
I think that's actually
his suitcase over there.

625
00:37:04.075 --> 00:37:05.142
What's your name?

626
00:37:07.078 --> 00:37:08.779
Uh. Calvin...

627
00:37:09.446 --> 00:37:10.781
Broadus.

628
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:13.050
People call me Snoop.

629
00:37:13.718 --> 00:37:15.720
Got some ID. Snoop?

630
00:37:17.922 --> 00:37:19.623
- Sorry. no.
- Oh. this is bullshit!

631
00:37:19.657 --> 00:37:20.658
OK. calm down.

632
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:22.592
He told me that he didn't
know who lives here.

633
00:37:22.626 --> 00:37:24.695
and he asked me for a name!

634
00:37:24.729 --> 00:37:26.764
I'll take it from here. OK?

635
00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:43.480
Is someone in there?

636
00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:46.117
Oh. uh. I don't...
I don't think so.

637
00:37:46.483 --> 00:37:48.185
Actually. I wouldn't
go in there.

638
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:51.055
I just did a monster shit.
and it's like...

639
00:37:51.722 --> 00:37:53.423
Whoa.

640
00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.902
When do you expect
your friend to get back?

641
00:38:10.808 --> 00:38:12.677
Uh. soon.

642
00:38:12.977 --> 00:38:14.979
Maybe you should
wait outside.

643
00:38:39.136 --> 00:38:41.504
Shit!

644
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:46.043
Fuck.

645
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.139
- It's clean?
- Definitely.

646
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:19.944
So you tidied up

647
00:39:19.977 --> 00:39:23.147
and you wiped clean
everything we touched?

648
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.249
What do you think
"definitely" means?

649
00:39:25.282 --> 00:39:28.219
Yeah. I cleaned up and tidied
everything we touched.

650
00:39:28.252 --> 00:39:31.255
just like your highness ordered.
so can we get fucking moving?

651
00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:33.090
Because the skipper's waiting.

652
00:39:33.124 --> 00:39:35.092
and she doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

653
00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:36.827
Fucking knew I should
have done it myself.

654
00:39:37.995 --> 00:39:39.663
Do I look like
a fucking idiot?

655
00:39:40.297 --> 00:39:41.799
You treat me
like a fucking idiot.

656
00:39:41.832 --> 00:39:43.200
and I don't like it.

657
00:39:43.834 --> 00:39:45.635
- You don't like it?
- I do not.

658
00:39:45.669 --> 00:39:47.271
You know.
there's a saying...

659
00:39:47.304 --> 00:39:49.874
you teach people
how to treat you.

660
00:39:49.907 --> 00:39:51.008
What?!

661
00:39:51.042 --> 00:39:53.310
Who's "they"?

662
00:39:53.344 --> 00:39:55.545
It's just what they say.

663
00:39:56.247 --> 00:39:58.215
Fuck!

664
00:39:58.749 --> 00:39:59.884
Fucking shit.

665
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.221
Jesus...

666
00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:06.791
What the fuck
are you waiting for?!

667
00:40:06.824 --> 00:40:10.094
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come on. man!

668
00:40:10.127 --> 00:40:11.962
Those cops are gonna ask us
fucking questions.

669
00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:14.899
and it's gonna fucking blow up
in our faces like fucking C4.

670
00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:16.100
And the skip won't be happy.
She won't be.

671
00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.234
- Fuck!
- Roy.

672
00:40:17.268 --> 00:40:19.602
- Won't be happy. okay.
- OK. it's all good. all right?

673
00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:21.105
OK. just use your breathing.

674
00:40:21.138 --> 00:40:23.640
Use your breathing.

675
00:40:23.674 --> 00:40:25.642
There. you happy?

676
00:40:25.676 --> 00:40:27.978
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm fucking happy!

677
00:40:28.012 --> 00:40:29.814
Breathing. Breathing.

678
00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:31.048
Here we go.

679
00:40:34.118 --> 00:40:35.119
Chill. dog.

680
00:40:35.953 --> 00:40:37.154
Chill. dog.

681
00:40:37.188 --> 00:40:39.190
- "Chill. dog"?
- What?

682
00:40:40.191 --> 00:40:42.726
- Who says that any more?
- Everyone.

683
00:40:43.994 --> 00:40:45.796
- Brolax.
- What?

684
00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:49.333
You know. "brolax".
It's like the new "chill dog".

685
00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:52.203
You know. but instead
of "chill dog".

686
00:40:52.236 --> 00:40:55.272
you've got bro and relax.
You put it together... brolax.

687
00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:56.707
- Brolax?
- Mm.

00:40:57.141 --> 00:40:58.075

00:43:49.413 --> 00:43:50.514
Here we go.

717
00:43:55.953 --> 00:43:57.821
<i>Mmm. yeah.</i>

718
00:44:07.164 --> 00:44:10.301
<i>Oh. momma.</i>

719
00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:21.945
<i>Oh. put it there.</i>

720
00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:32.289
Hey. boss.

721
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:37.061
Slang for anus.
Four letters. Ends with E.

722
00:44:37.428 --> 00:44:38.929
Arse doesn't fit.

723
00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:43.867
So. it's done?

724
00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:46.236
Uh. kinda.
Kinda done.

725
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.404
What do you mean
"kind of"?

726
00:44:47.438 --> 00:44:49.506
How can someone be
kind of dead?

727
00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.341
He's dead.

728
00:44:50.374 --> 00:44:52.910
You know. he's...
definitely dead.

729
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.381
<i>There was just no signs
of a break-in or a struggle.</i>

730
00:44:57.414 --> 00:44:59.917
so we figured. you know...

731
00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:01.585
heart attack?

732
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:05.155
Yeah. I mean. a body of those
proportions. you know. it was...

733
00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:07.057
What?

734
00:45:07.091 --> 00:45:07.925
Roy had a hunch.

735
00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:10.394
Here's my hunch.
This is what happened.

736
00:45:10.427 --> 00:45:13.665
He ate it. and then he tries to
shit it out in the bath. right?

737
00:45:13.698 --> 00:45:15.165
Because if he tried
to shit it out in the toilet.

738
00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:16.567
it would go down
the drain. right?

739
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.602
So while he's trying to
shit it out in the bath.

740
00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:21.605
the strain was so big that.

741
00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:23.474
boom. heart attack!

742
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:26.610
Jeff ate the merchandise?

743
00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:28.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

744
00:45:28.345 --> 00:45:30.481
So it's still inside him.
and we need to cut it out.

745
00:45:30.514 --> 00:45:32.649
No fucking way
I'm cutting him up.

746
00:45:33.317 --> 00:45:35.052
Which leaves...

747
00:45:35.352 --> 00:45:36.520
well. just you.

748
00:45:36.553 --> 00:45:37.955
- Me?
- Hmm.

749
00:45:37.988 --> 00:45:39.390
- I saw a meat clever...
- Hey. whoa. whoa.

750
00:45:39.423 --> 00:45:40.958
- Oh. what?
- A meat clever?

751
00:45:40.991 --> 00:45:42.159
Yeah.

752
00:45:43.193 --> 00:45:45.195
- Yeah.
- What?

753
00:45:46.731 --> 00:45:48.365
W-We can't do it here

754
00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:51.001
cos of forensics
and whatnot.

755
00:45:51.669 --> 00:45:54.571
- Which is why...
- Oh God no.

756
00:45:55.105 --> 00:45:57.241
- We take him to the workshop.
- Right.

757
00:45:57.274 --> 00:45:59.243
And we let the skip do it.

758
00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:03.347
- He's in the van.
- Oh. is he?

759
00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.384
We dressed him in a tracksuit
so nothing looked suspicious.

760
00:46:07.418 --> 00:46:09.186
Hmm.
Tell me. Roy.

761
00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:11.155
the room you found him in.

762
00:46:11.188 --> 00:46:12.990
what floor was it on?

763
00:46:13.424 --> 00:46:15.092
- First.
- First.

764
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.662
- Oh. so there were stairs?
- Yep.

765
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:19.463
And where did you park?

766
00:46:19.496 --> 00:46:22.366
Uh. on the street
outside the motel.

767
00:46:22.734 --> 00:46:24.435
Oh. I see.

768
00:46:24.468 --> 00:46:28.172
So. let's just recreate this
morning's events. shall we?

769
00:46:28.205 --> 00:46:31.341
So you find Jeff dead
in the bathroom.

770
00:46:31.676 --> 00:46:33.644
<i>and you put him in
a tracksuit.</i>

771
00:46:34.478 --> 00:46:36.346
then you carry him

772
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.550
<i>down some stairs
and on to a public street.</i>

773
00:46:40.551 --> 00:46:43.053
and you put him
in the van.

774
00:46:44.789 --> 00:46:46.623
And all this
takes place when?

775
00:46:47.424 --> 00:46:49.359
Oh. it was early-ish. eh.

776
00:46:49.393 --> 00:46:51.228
In broad fucking daylight!

777
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:55.098
And then you drive a body
the size of a small whale

778
00:46:55.132 --> 00:46:56.567
around the city

779
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.403
and you leave him
parked in a van

780
00:46:59.503 --> 00:47:01.673
outside my shop.

781
00:47:02.105 --> 00:47:05.743
But nothing looks suspicious.
does it?

782
00:47:11.615 --> 00:47:14.451
I-I-It's so nice
to see you brolax.

783
00:47:14.485 --> 00:47:16.553
What did you say?

784
00:47:16.587 --> 00:47:18.055
- Don't.
- Brolax.

785
00:47:18.088 --> 00:47:20.090
It's like when you're
a brother relaxing.

786
00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:22.292
- and you just take out the...
- Are you on fucking meth?!

787
00:47:22.326 --> 00:47:24.194
No. not today.

788
00:47:28.298 --> 00:47:30.300
All right. bring him in.

789
00:47:33.504 --> 00:47:34.739

794
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.366

it was acceptable

795
00:48:02.399 --> 00:48:04.268
to call me Skip?

796
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:06.771
What. so that doesn't
get your freak on?

- My "freak on"?
- Yeah.

798

Well. gentlemen.

823
00:49:12.937 --> 00:49:15.673
the merchandise
is not in the fat man.

824
00:49:16.473 --> 00:49:17.641
Which means what?

825
00:49:18.308 --> 00:49:19.443
It's somewhere else.

826
00:49:19.576 --> 00:49:20.712
It's somewhere else.

827
00:49:20.745 --> 00:49:23.480
That is correct.
Well done. Semo.

828
00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:24.816
But where?

829
00:49:26.316 --> 00:49:28.418
- Good question.
- Good question?

830
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.788
Not a good question?

831
00:49:30.822 --> 00:49:33.490
No. Roy. that's not
a good question.

832
00:49:33.858 --> 00:49:36.526
That is an outstanding question.

833
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.630
That is the best
fucking question

834
00:49:39.664 --> 00:49:41.365
on the entire fucking planet.

835
00:49:41.398 --> 00:49:43.634
That is the fucking
"to be or not to be"

836
00:49:43.668 --> 00:49:46.203
of fucking questions.
and I want it fucking answered.

837
00:49:46.236 --> 00:49:47.872
so get back to that
fucking motel.

838
00:49:47.905 --> 00:49:49.473
and you fucking rip
that place apart.

839
00:49:49.506 --> 00:49:50.808
and you don't fucking stop

840
00:49:50.842 --> 00:49:54.177
until you find my
fucking merchandise!

841
00:50:01.986 --> 00:50:03.788
Why couldn't you just
have eaten it

842
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:06.390
like you clearly eat
everything else?

843
00:50:29.246 --> 00:50:30.815
<i>You think about a lot
of things when you're</i>

844
00:50:30.848 --> 00:50:33.216
<i>trapped under a bed
in a motel room</i>

845
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:34.886
<i>with a guy who
might want to kill you</i>

846
00:50:34.919 --> 00:50:36.788
<i>if he found out you were
there to kill him</i>

847
00:50:36.821 --> 00:50:38.522
<i>for screwing your boss' wife.</i>

848
00:50:38.555 --> 00:50:40.758
All kinds of stuff...
random stuff.

849
00:50:40.792 --> 00:50:44.862
<i>like what I'd do differently
if I coached the Warriors.</i>

850
00:50:44.896 --> 00:50:46.731
<i>Other stuff too.</i>

851
00:50:46.764 --> 00:50:48.365
<i>like my dad.</i>

852
00:50:48.398 --> 00:50:50.400
<i>who didn't deserve to die.</i>

853
00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:52.904
<i>and what he might
say right now.</i>

854
00:50:53.771 --> 00:50:55.539
<i>Something like.</i>

855
00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.210
<i>"You made a mistake. son.
getting involved with Spiggs."</i>

856
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:02.814
<i>And then he'd hug me</i>

857
00:51:03.613 --> 00:51:05.582
<i>and tell me he loved me.</i>

858
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.520
<i>Then I thought about the time
and the high noon thing.</i>

859
00:51:10.554 --> 00:51:12.824
<i>and the deadline and how
I needed to do this for Marvin.</i>

860
00:51:12.857 --> 00:51:14.692
<i>who was always there for me.</i>

861
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:18.562
<i>And I thought.</i>

862
00:51:18.595 --> 00:51:20.898
<i>"Yeah.
Dad would understand."</i>

863
00:51:22.399 --> 00:51:23.935
<i>But then I was all like.</i>

864
00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:26.603
<i>"Man. this is really confusing."</i>

865
00:51:27.071 --> 00:51:29.339
<i>The only thing I could
think to do next was</i>

866
00:51:29.372 --> 00:51:31.308
<i>pray for a miracle.</i>

867
00:51:48.993 --> 00:51:50.494
<i>Jeff?</i>

868
00:51:58.502 --> 00:51:59.369
Jeff?

869
00:52:02.774 --> 00:52:04.809
Jeff?

870
00:52:15.019 --> 00:52:17.287
Tell us where it is
and we'll be on our way.

871
00:52:19.957 --> 00:52:20.992
Fuck!

872
00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.830
Oh. righty-oh. mate.

873
00:52:25.997 --> 00:52:27.464
Oh. that...

874
00:52:27.497 --> 00:52:28.532
that's dirty.

875
00:52:41.545 --> 00:52:43.547
Fuck.

876
00:52:45.649 --> 00:52:46.583
Jesus.

877
00:52:49.921 --> 00:52:51.388
OK.

878
00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.927
We know Jeff stole it.

879
00:52:56.626 --> 00:52:58.495
And we know he
was hiding out in here.

880
00:52:58.528 --> 00:53:00.832
which means you know
why he was hiding out.

881
00:53:00.865 --> 00:53:03.768
which means you know
where it is. So where is it?

882
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.469
Jeff said he needed a place
to stay for a while.

883
00:53:06.503 --> 00:53:07.537
but I don't know
what you mean.

884
00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:13.911
Please. don't hurt me. please.

885
00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:16.714
- Toilet?
- Yeah. yeah.

886
00:53:17.581 --> 00:53:18.749
- Get up.
- The toilet?

887
00:53:18.783 --> 00:53:20.417
- Yeah. yeah. get up. Come on.
- I don't need toilet!

888
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:21.886
I don't need toilet!

889
00:53:21.919 --> 00:53:22.854
Right. toilet.

890
00:53:22.887 --> 00:53:25.022
- No. thank you. I don't need it!
- Let's go.

891
00:53:26.657 --> 00:53:28.659
Where is it?!

892
00:53:37.567 --> 00:53:40.738
Where is what!

893
00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:42.539
Wrong!

894
00:53:42.572 --> 00:53:45.710
We know that Jeff came here
after he took it!

895
00:53:45.743 --> 00:53:48.145
Just tell us!

896
00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.750
- Where the fuck is it?!
- Oi. oi. oi. oi.

897
00:53:52.783 --> 00:53:54.618
- Where the fuck is it?!
- Hey. hey. Wait. wait!

898
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:57.154
Come. Hey. hey. hey.
Take it easy.

899
00:53:57.554 --> 00:53:58.723
What the fuck. bro?

900
00:53:58.756 --> 00:54:01.458
Fuck. he's no good to us dead.
is he?

901
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.594
Come on. stay with me.

902
00:54:04.628 --> 00:54:05.428
Yo. bro.

903
00:54:06.998 --> 00:54:09.432
Hey. just tell us where it is
and we'll call an ambulance.

904
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:12.737
Yo.

905
00:54:15.907 --> 00:54:16.841
Hey. hey. hey.

906
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.410
Come on. no. no. no.

907
00:54:25.016 --> 00:54:26.449
Oh shit.

908
00:54:28.853 --> 00:54:30.688
You always fuck things up.
don't you?

909
00:54:31.756 --> 00:54:33.456
He should have told us.

910
00:54:33.858 --> 00:54:34.859
Fuck!

911
00:54:35.226 --> 00:54:36.493
Fuck!

912
00:54:36.526 --> 00:54:37.460
So what do we do now?

913
00:54:37.494 --> 00:54:39.897
Not gonna stick around here.
that's for sure.

914
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:40.965
OK. let me think.

915
00:54:40.998 --> 00:54:43.533
We rip the place apart.
like she asked us to. OK?

916
00:54:43.566 --> 00:54:44.769
But we found nothing.

917
00:54:44.802 --> 00:54:48.239
- What about the merchandise?
- Fuck the merchandise. bro.

918
00:54:48.272 --> 00:54:50.107
That's two dead bodies. OK.

919
00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:52.243
because of this fucking
merchandise.

920
00:54:52.276 --> 00:54:54.812
I don't want to be body number
three. do you?

921
00:54:54.845 --> 00:54:55.813
Good. Let's go.

922
00:54:57.214 --> 00:54:59.183
Oh. wait.

923
00:55:03.054 --> 00:55:04.587
Fuck. Roy. come on.

924
00:55:04.621 --> 00:55:07.658
- Oh. what is up with his...?
- Roy!

925
00:55:29.146 --> 00:55:30.647
Freddy?

926
00:55:30.681 --> 00:55:31.949
He's gone.

927
00:55:32.649 --> 00:55:33.851
<i>Who?</i>

928
00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:35.820
The fat man. he's gone.

929
00:55:35.853 --> 00:55:37.021
What do you mean gone?

930
00:55:37.054 --> 00:55:39.690
Well. I got back here to the
place. and he's not here.

931
00:55:39.724 --> 00:55:41.726
- <i>He's gone.</i>
- Well. where is he?

932
00:55:41.759 --> 00:55:43.794
- I don't know.
- You said he was dead!

933
00:55:43.828 --> 00:55:46.529
- Yeah. he was. but...
- Then fucking what?!

934
00:55:46.563 --> 00:55:48.165
But what if he wasn't?

935
00:55:48.199 --> 00:55:49.599
Shit.

936
00:55:51.769 --> 00:55:53.104
Donny might have found him.

937
00:55:54.205 --> 00:55:56.907
Yeah. I-I don't think so.

938
00:55:57.607 --> 00:55:59.110
Well. how do you know that?

939
00:55:59.143 --> 00:56:00.745
Because...

940
00:56:00.778 --> 00:56:02.780
Donny's here.

941
00:56:03.114 --> 00:56:05.282
I'm looking right at him.

942
00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:07.852
Put him on.

943
00:56:07.885 --> 00:56:10.087
I can't. He's gone.

944
00:56:10.254 --> 00:56:12.289
Like. gone gone.

945
00:56:13.758 --> 00:56:15.659
- Dead gone?
- Yeah.

946
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.195
What happened?

947
00:56:18.662 --> 00:56:20.197
I killed him.

948
00:56:21.365 --> 00:56:23.267
You killed him?

949
00:56:23.868 --> 00:56:25.736
Yeah. so...

950
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.972
So you can let Marvin go now.
OK?

951
00:56:30.607 --> 00:56:32.777
And why would I do that. huh?

952
00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.679
Because that was the deal.

953
00:56:36.013 --> 00:56:39.016
I mean. I've done everything
you asked me to.

954
00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:41.185
and it's before the deadline.
so...

955
00:56:41.218 --> 00:56:43.687
So you just want me
to take your word for it

956
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:48.059
that you took care of Donny
and expect me to let Marvin go?

957
00:56:48.826 --> 00:56:50.560
Well...

958
00:56:51.028 --> 00:56:52.229
yeah.

959
00:56:52.263 --> 00:56:55.366
Well. nah. I want proof.

960
00:56:55.399 --> 00:56:58.568
And until I get it.
we're not square as a bear.

961
00:56:59.236 --> 00:57:01.806
So here's what
I want you to do.

962
00:57:03.174 --> 00:57:05.109
Piece of shit!

963
00:57:05.342 --> 00:57:06.811

OK.

Let's get the fuck
out of here.

968
00:57:21.425 --> 00:57:23.626
Oh. oh. wait. wait. wait.

969
00:57:24.028 --> 00:57:25.229
Fuck. I left my prints
on the seat.

970
00:57:25.262 --> 00:57:26.063
Don't worry about it!

971
00:57:26.097 --> 00:57:28.732
No. I need to wipe
the seat clean!

972
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.368
Fucking hurry up. then.

973
00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:33.170
Fuck. Shit.

Seriously?

1015
00:59:50.174 --> 00:59:52.276
I broke in. OK?

1016
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:54.378
I'm sorry if that was
your guys' place.

1017
00:59:55.346 --> 00:59:57.081
You know where it is.
don't you?

1018
00:59:57.114 --> 00:59:58.849
Where what is?

1019
00:59:58.882 --> 01:00:00.317
- What's your name?
- Freddy.

1020
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.552
Freddy who?

1021
01:00:01.585 --> 01:00:03.053
Winiata.

1022
01:00:03.087 --> 01:00:04.555
OK. Freddy Winiata.

1023
01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.991
do you know a fat guy
called Jeff Kwok?

1024
01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:08.792
I've never heard of him.

1025
01:00:08.826 --> 01:00:10.828
OK. OK. OK. OK.

1026
01:00:10.995 --> 01:00:14.531
So. you don't fuck with us
and we don't fuck with you.

1027
01:00:14.565 --> 01:00:17.935
This is your last chance. OK?
Where is it?

1028
01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.503
Where is what?

1029
01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:20.904
Oh. OK. yeah.

1030
01:00:20.938 --> 01:00:22.072
Yeah. yeah. yeah?

1031
01:00:22.106 --> 01:00:23.173
OK. hey. hey.
Hey. hey. hey.

1032
01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:23.907
You don't think I will?!

1033
01:00:23.941 --> 01:00:25.876
Hey. hey. Hey. hey. hey.
Listen.

1034
01:00:25.909 --> 01:00:28.879
Can we just try
and keep this one alive?

1035
01:00:28.912 --> 01:00:30.281
Just search him.

1036
01:00:30.314 --> 01:00:32.916
- You search him.
- Just... Just do it. Roy.

1037
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.018
Eh. that...

1038
01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:36.053
That's not my name.

1039
01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:44.828
Frederick Winiata.
Least you're not lying

1040
01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.030
about your name. Freddy.

1041
01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.599
- Is there anything else?
- He's a donor.

1042
01:00:48.632 --> 01:00:50.834
The wallet. dick.

1043
01:00:55.439 --> 01:00:57.374
Where'd you get this?

1044
01:00:58.275 --> 01:01:00.010
- I stole it.
- You stole it?

1045
01:01:00.044 --> 01:01:01.578
I can...

1046
01:01:01.612 --> 01:01:04.448
I can sell it
for 50 bucks easy

1047
01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:07.351
to. you know.
an illegal immigrant.

1048
01:01:08.419 --> 01:01:09.286
Right.

1049
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.389
What. an oversized
illegal immigrant?

1050
01:01:12.556 --> 01:01:14.558
Yeah. I mean. probably.

1051
01:01:15.326 --> 01:01:16.560
Freddy. just tell us
where the merchandise is

1052
01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:19.096
and we'll let you go.
It's that easy.

1053
01:01:19.129 --> 01:01:20.831
What merchandise?

1054
01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:23.467
Where'd you put it. bitch?

1055
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.935
Did the fat guy
give it to you

1056
01:01:24.968 --> 01:01:27.071
or did the skinny guy
give it to you?

1057
01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:28.906
Where'd you put it?!

1058
01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:30.307
Yeah. OK.
he can't breathe.

1059
01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:32.076
Hey. hey. Roy.
let him go.

1060
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:33.977
Hey. hey.

1061
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.082
He's not gonna tell us
because he knows

1062
01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:40.084
how much the merchandise
is worth.

1063
01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:41.518
He's gonna keep to his story
about breaking in

1064
01:01:41.552 --> 01:01:44.088
because he knows
we can't prove it.

1065
01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:45.956
Isn't that right. Freddy?

1066
01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:49.393
Shit.

1067
01:01:49.426 --> 01:01:51.428
- Oi.
- What?

1068
01:01:52.697 --> 01:01:54.631
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

1069
01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:55.834
I doubt it.

1070
01:01:55.866 --> 01:02:00.070
We escalate the situation.
We let the skip deal with it.

1071
01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:02.473
That's pretty good.

1072
01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:05.042
Freddy. have you heard
of The Upholsterer?

1073
01:02:06.678 --> 01:02:08.979
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

1074
01:02:09.546 --> 01:02:12.082
Well. I think she'd kinda
like to see you.

1075
01:02:16.453 --> 01:02:19.156
Do you like horses. Freddy?
Hmm?

1076
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.492
They're all right.

1077
01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:24.061
You can tell a lot
about a horse from its teeth...

1078
01:02:24.094 --> 01:02:27.364
its age. its diet.
its general health.

1079
01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:30.000
even its possible vices.

1080
01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:32.569
such as wood-chewing
and the like.

1081
01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:35.406
Well. people are much
the same.

1082
01:02:35.707 --> 01:02:37.474
But our vices. well.

1083
01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.176
that's where you and I are quite
different from a horse

1084
01:02:39.209 --> 01:02:43.113
because our vices aren't
quite so easy to detect.

1085
01:02:43.147 --> 01:02:45.149
But we all have them.
don't we?

1086
01:02:45.516 --> 01:02:47.584
So what's your vice. Freddy.
hmm?

1087
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.387
Is it drugs?

1088
01:02:51.155 --> 01:02:52.623
Girls?

1089
01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.359
Boys?

1090
01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:57.695
And how would a young man
like yourself

1091
01:02:57.729 --> 01:02:59.930
pay for such things. hmm?

1092
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:03.735
Perhaps that's why you broke
into the very same motel

1093
01:03:03.768 --> 01:03:06.570
where a man who stole from me
something of great value

1094
01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:08.439
was hiding out.

1095
01:03:08.472 --> 01:03:10.340
This gentlemen right here.
in fact.

1096
01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:13.610
What did you break into
that motel room to steal?

1097
01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:16.647
This very same man's
driver's license.

1098
01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:19.082
Which you say
you can get $50

1099
01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:22.052
on some black market
for illegal immigrants.

1100
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.290
Now. I know people have
been killed for less.

1101
01:03:26.323 --> 01:03:29.359
but $50 is not a lot of money.
is it?

1102
01:03:30.594 --> 01:03:32.629
Perhaps you took
Jeff's license

1103
01:03:32.664 --> 01:03:36.567
because he didn't have
a heart attack. did he?

1104
01:03:36.668 --> 01:03:38.670
No. you killed him somehow.

1105
01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:41.205
Perhaps asphyxiation.

1106
01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.340
And then you went back
to erase any evidence

1107
01:03:43.373 --> 01:03:44.709
that he was ever
in that room.

1108
01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:46.410
- <i>Police.</i>
- Just a second.

1109
01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:48.412
While you were doing that.

1110
01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:50.581
trying to figure out where
the fat man was

1111
01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:53.183
and how the skinny man
ended up dead.

1112
01:03:53.217 --> 01:03:55.285
you were interrupted.
Aw!

1113
01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:56.688
<i>Jeff?</i>

1114
01:03:58.155 --> 01:04:00.157
But tell me. son.

1115
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.192
is it worth your life?

1116
01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.529
Is getting all the money
you ever dreamed of.

1117
01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:08.298
is it really worth dying for.
hmm?

1118
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.601
Motherfucker!

1119
01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:12.302
Where is it?

1120
01:04:13.738 --> 01:04:15.272
I don't know.

1121
01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:19.243
Maybe it's in there.

1122
01:04:19.276 --> 01:04:20.577
Hmm?

1123
01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:23.313
Here. take a closer look.

1124
01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:26.483
Is it in there. Freddy. hmm?

1125
01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:29.353
I can't hear you.

1126
01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:30.722
No?

1127
01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:34.726
- Where is it?!
- I don't... I don't know!

1128
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:38.328
You could check up his date.

1129
01:04:38.362 --> 01:04:40.364
- His what?
- His date.

1130
01:04:40.665 --> 01:04:42.165
His arse.

1131
01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:44.434
People put some
crazy shit up there.

1132
01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:46.503
I saw this doco about
drug smugglers.

1133
01:04:46.537 --> 01:04:48.171
They get condoms.
fill them full of drugs.

1134
01:04:48.205 --> 01:04:49.640
and stick them
up their bums.

1135
01:04:49.674 --> 01:04:51.575
It's pretty amazing what
you can fit up there.

1136
01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:53.610
Roy. come and take a look.

1137
01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:56.146
Wait.

1138
01:04:56.179 --> 01:05:00.083
Wait. Slang for anus.
four letters... "date."

1139
01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:03.153
Give me the paper
and a pen.

1140
01:05:03.186 --> 01:05:05.188
- Hurry up.
- There you go.

1141
01:05:07.558 --> 01:05:09.393
D-A-T-E.

1142
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:11.128
Perfect.

1143
01:05:11.528 --> 01:05:13.798
Right. continue.

1144
01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:18.368
You left his phone on him?

1145
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.638
Where's your phone. Freddy?

1146
01:05:21.673 --> 01:05:23.675
Hmm?
Where is it?

1147
01:05:26.376 --> 01:05:28.680
So. who'd be calling you.
hmm?

1148
01:05:29.646 --> 01:05:31.648
I don't... I don't know.

1149
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.451
Yes?

1150
01:05:35.519 --> 01:05:36.854
Who's this?

1151
01:05:38.488 --> 01:05:39.556
Who's this?

1152
01:05:40.725 --> 01:05:41.826
Who's this?

1153
01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.796
Who's this?

1154
01:05:45.395 --> 01:05:46.731
Tell me who this is!

1155
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.567
You tell me who this is.

1156
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.171
Where's Freddy?

1157
01:05:55.606 --> 01:05:56.874
You tell me.

1158
01:05:57.574 --> 01:05:58.175
What?

1159
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.212
Well. where should he be?

1160
01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.515
Is Freddy there or not?

1161
01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:08.720
Who wants to know?

1162
01:06:08.753 --> 01:06:10.387
Who the fuck is this?!

1163
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.856
Who is this?!

1164
01:06:11.889 --> 01:06:13.390
Put him on!

1165
01:06:14.524 --> 01:06:16.593
Well. you see.
he's a bit busy.

1166
01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.363
Busy doing what?

1167
01:06:19.964 --> 01:06:21.733
Is there a message?

1168
01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:24.401
Yeah.

1169
01:06:25.268 --> 01:06:27.170
Yeah. here's the message.

1170
01:06:30.374 --> 01:06:32.376
- Bang.
- Bang?

1171
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:34.611
Freddy.

1172
01:06:34.645 --> 01:06:36.647
Who's expecting you?

1173
01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:38.683
- Hmm?
- Nobody.

1174
01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:41.218
Keep searching him.

1175
01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.188
- Hey. hey.
- Hey. whoa.

1176
01:06:45.355 --> 01:06:45.923
What is it?

1177
01:06:45.957 --> 01:06:48.158
What's this?

1178
01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:52.162
Had it on him
the whole time.

1179
01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:55.933
Oh.

1180
01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:01.304
Is that a...?

1181
01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:02.907
Yeah. looks like it.

1182
01:07:03.573 --> 01:07:04.608
It's kind of. um...

1183
01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:06.343
Donny.

1184
01:07:06.576 --> 01:07:08.245
Freddy?

1185
01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:10.347
What are you doing with
Donny Kong's penis?

1186
01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.849
It's worth heaps of money

1187
01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:15.185
in the...
in the Asian market.

1188
01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:19.189
It's used for soups.
It's like a delicacy.

1189
01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:21.558
He was dead. so...

1190
01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.262
Roy killed him.

1191
01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:27.364
I... I mean.
that's where I saw it.

1192
01:07:27.397 --> 01:07:29.466
I don't believe you've been
completely honest with us.

1193
01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:30.835
have you?

1194
01:07:32.602 --> 01:07:34.772
Why did you
deem it necessary

1195
01:07:34.806 --> 01:07:37.407
to cut off
Donny Kong's penis

1196
01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:39.744
and put it in your pocket?

1197
01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:41.846
I have to deliver it
by noon.

1198
01:07:41.879 --> 01:07:44.481
otherwise Marvin's
gonna get shot.

1199
01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:46.784
Ah. bang. hmm.

1200
01:07:47.885 --> 01:07:50.420
Come on. Freddy.
who sent you?

1201
01:07:50.722 --> 01:07:51.689
Who was on the phone?

1202
01:07:51.723 --> 01:07:53.590
It was... It was meant
to be the skinny man.

1203
01:07:53.623 --> 01:07:55.927
not the fat man.
but I didn't know that.

1204
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.995
The fat man wasn't meant
to be there. was...

1205
01:07:58.029 --> 01:08:01.398
Who fucking sent you?!

1206
01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.355
Ah. what a shame.

1207
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.359
Well. can't say I didn't
give him fair warning. huh?

1208
01:08:30.061 --> 01:08:31.929
No. no. no.
He'll make it.

1209
01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:33.664
He will.
No. no. no. no.

1210
01:08:33.698 --> 01:08:35.532
He'll be here.
He'll make it.

1211
01:08:35.565 --> 01:08:37.902
- He will.
- Oh. shut the fuck up.

1212
01:08:37.935 --> 01:08:39.603
No! No!

1213
01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:41.505
Help! Help!

1214
01:08:41.538 --> 01:08:44.574
Look at you. Look at you
about to pee your pants

1215
01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:47.611
like a little fucking girl!

1216
01:08:47.745 --> 01:08:51.348
You're fucking crazy.

1217
01:08:51.783 --> 01:08:53.583
- Ah.
- Come again.

1218
01:08:53.617 --> 01:08:56.453
You're fucking crazy.
you fucking psycho!

1219
01:08:56.486 --> 01:08:58.723
I thought you were
fucking cool!

1220
01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:02.592
Wait...

1221
01:09:02.626 --> 01:09:04.461
I'm not cool?

1222
01:09:04.494 --> 01:09:05.629
Well...

1223
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.670
Oh.

1224
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:14.739
Oh yeah!

1225
01:09:18.508 --> 01:09:20.377
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1226
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.345
Oh! Yeah.

1227
01:09:22.379 --> 01:09:23.547
I might be fucking crazy.

1228
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.083
but if your friend doesn't
turn up in the next half hour.

1229
01:09:26.117 --> 01:09:29.653
your other foot is gonna get
the same fucking treatment!

1230
01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.823
<i>Don't let me interrupt.
Mickey.</i>

1231
01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:36.359
The Upholsterer.

1232
01:09:37.561 --> 01:09:39.362
Well. well. well.

1233
01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:41.766
I think you know
why I'm here.

1234
01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:43.801
Lap dance?

1235
01:09:44.634 --> 01:09:45.903
You know. when I heard
the name Mickey Spiggs.

1236
01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:47.705
it all made sense.

1237
01:09:47.738 --> 01:09:49.372
I'm connected to Jeff Kwok.

1238
01:09:49.406 --> 01:09:51.108
Jeff Kwok is connected
to Donny Kong.

1239
01:09:51.142 --> 01:09:53.610
and Donny Kong.
if I'm not mistaken.

1240
01:09:53.643 --> 01:09:54.979
is connected to you.

1241
01:09:55.012 --> 01:09:56.646
I know what you did to Jeff.

1242
01:09:56.681 --> 01:09:58.716
and the reason you did what
you did to Jeff is because

1243
01:09:58.749 --> 01:10:01.052
you knew that he had
what belongs to me.

1244
01:10:01.085 --> 01:10:04.621
So just hand it over
and we'll be on our way.

1245
01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.124
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Take it easy. all right?

1246
01:10:07.158 --> 01:10:08.659
Just-Just take it easy.

1247
01:10:08.693 --> 01:10:10.761
I have no idea
who Jeff Kwok is.

1248
01:10:10.795 --> 01:10:14.098
and I have no idea what the fuck
you're talking about.

1249
01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:16.133
Take a seat.

1250
01:10:16.834 --> 01:10:19.036
Jeff is a rather large man
who was killed earlier today

1251
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.038
in his place of temporary
residence by Freddy.

1252
01:10:21.072 --> 01:10:23.440
who I believe
is in your employ.

1253
01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:25.442
- The fat man?
- Not only was he fat. Mickey.

1254
01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:28.880
he was also stupid.
He stole something from me.

1255
01:10:28.913 --> 01:10:30.882
Freddy stole it from him.
killed him

1256
01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:33.117
and then gave it to you.

1257
01:10:33.718 --> 01:10:36.553
Yeah. nah. that's not
actually what happened.

1258
01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:38.789
- Where the fuck is it?
- Listen.

1259
01:10:38.823 --> 01:10:40.825
I didn't even know the fat man
existed till this morning.

1260
01:10:40.858 --> 01:10:43.127
Oh. have I not been
polite thus far?

1261
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.030
- Yeah.
- Have I not been reasonable?

1262
01:10:46.063 --> 01:10:48.165
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I think I have.

1263
01:10:48.199 --> 01:10:49.499
You see.
being polite and reasonable

1264
01:10:49.532 --> 01:10:50.968
about this is plan A.

1265
01:10:51.002 --> 01:10:52.036
If you do not hand it over.

1266
01:10:52.069 --> 01:10:53.771
you will force me
to go to plan B.

1267
01:10:53.804 --> 01:10:57.174
And plan B is not so polite
and reasonable.

1268
01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.643
But let me try and persuade you
to stick with plan A.

1269
01:10:59.677 --> 01:11:02.914
because I really hate to make
a mess unnecessarily.

1270
01:11:02.947 --> 01:11:05.615
So. first you need
to know two things.

1271
01:11:05.649 --> 01:11:08.652
One. if the merchandise is not
back in my possession

1272
01:11:08.686 --> 01:11:12.156
within the hour.
I will execute you.

1273
01:11:12.823 --> 01:11:14.759
Yeah.

1274
01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.660
And. two.

1275
01:11:15.693 --> 01:11:17.762
- Pa-ching.
- One of my men is outside

1276
01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.931
in a van with Freddy.
who will also be executed

1277
01:11:19.964 --> 01:11:21.766
should plan A fail.

1278
01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:23.968
So what's it going to be.
Mickey?

1279
01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:27.171
Plan A. everyone lives.

1280
01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:30.573
or plan B.
not everyone lives?

1281
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.946
It's entirely up to you.

1282
01:11:42.253 --> 01:11:44.655
Hey. let Marvin go!

1283
01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:47.725
Semo.

1284
01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:50.895
How did Freddy get a gun?

1285
01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:54.031
And why can I see
your genitals?

1286
01:11:55.066 --> 01:11:56.466
Fucking Roy's fault.

1287
01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.941
Gum?

1288
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.143
I'm cool.

1289
01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:10.114
Hey. uh.
your dad drive a cab?

1290
01:12:11.816 --> 01:12:13.918
Why?
Did you know him?

1291
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:15.152
No. not really.

1292
01:12:26.897 --> 01:12:28.733
Bro.

1293
01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:33.170
- How did you...?
- Hands on your head!

1294
01:12:33.204 --> 01:12:34.571
OK.

1295
01:12:37.008 --> 01:12:38.876
OK. just take it easy.
Freddy.

1296
01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:40.011
Give me your gun.

1297
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.748
Give me your gun!

1298
01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:45.116
OK.

1299
01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:52.056
Get out.

1300
01:12:57.161 --> 01:12:58.996
- Now take off your clothes.
- Eh?

1301
01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.197
I wanna see if that's
all you're carrying.

1302
01:13:00.231 --> 01:13:02.800
- That's everything.
- Do it!

1303
01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:13.210
There you go. Freddy.

1304
01:13:13.677 --> 01:13:15.012
Everything.

1305
01:13:15.046 --> 01:13:16.313
Oh. come on!

1306
01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.983
<i>Now back to the end
at the beginning.</i>

1307
01:13:19.717 --> 01:13:21.786
<i>Or is it the other way?</i>

1308
01:13:22.186 --> 01:13:24.188
What do you want. Freddy?

1309
01:13:26.991 --> 01:13:28.292
Go and untie Marvin.

1310
01:13:28.325 --> 01:13:30.728
Semo. don't you move.

1311
01:13:31.896 --> 01:13:34.597
Do you know why they call me
The Upholsterer?

1312
01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:37.902
I know it's not a razzle-dazzle
name like Ms. Untouchable

1313
01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.870
or Bonnie Bamboo.

1314
01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:41.705
but it fits.

1315
01:13:41.739 --> 01:13:44.775
You see. because I like to make
people feel comfortable.

1316
01:13:44.809 --> 01:13:46.877
Now. to make you comfortable.

1317
01:13:46.911 --> 01:13:51.348
I assume I'd have to let you
and Marvin leave here intact.

1318
01:13:51.382 --> 01:13:53.717
Yes?
For me to feel comfortable.

1319
01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:56.253
I need to leave here
with my merchandise.

1320
01:13:56.821 --> 01:14:00.191
So why don't we just make
each other comfortable. hm?

1321
01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:04.662
OK. yeah.

1322
01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:06.764
I have it.

1323
01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.767
Marvin leaves
and you get it back.

1324
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.369
No. the merchandise first.

1325
01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:18.175
OK. but...

1326
01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:21.378
we do this without guns.

1327
01:14:21.412 --> 01:14:22.880
We all put them down.

1328
01:14:22.913 --> 01:14:24.949
You're dreaming. mate.

1329
01:14:28.986 --> 01:14:30.321
Well?

1330
01:14:31.088 --> 01:14:32.790
Where is it?

1331
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.191
Safe.

1332
01:15:00.117 --> 01:15:01.418
Roy.

1333
01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:03.988
But then he can just
shoot us.

1334
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:07.158
Oh. I think Freddy knows
that would be a mistake.

1335
01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:08.859
Put... your...

1336
01:15:08.893 --> 01:15:10.928
gun... down.

1337
01:15:12.997 --> 01:15:14.798
Put your fucking gun down.

1338
01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.338
Your other gun. Freddy.

1339
01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.444
Frederick Winiata.

1340
01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.115
How did you know him?

1341
01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:37.021
How did you know my dad?!

1342
01:15:39.356 --> 01:15:41.392
He was a good man.
reliable...

1343
01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:42.927
mostly.

1344
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.462
Liked the ponies.

1345
01:15:46.864 --> 01:15:48.165
He worked for you?

1346
01:15:48.532 --> 01:15:50.734
Of course he did.

1347
01:15:51.035 --> 01:15:53.938
A pick-up or a drop-off
every now and then.

1348
01:15:55.005 --> 01:15:57.374
Well. he had the perfect cover.
didn't he?

1349
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.712
Why'd he die?

1350
01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:04.348
Does it matter?

1351
01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:09.153
You do look a bit like him.

1352
01:16:12.022 --> 01:16:14.058
You can put it down.
I didn't kill him.

1353
01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.427
I don't believe you.

1354
01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.095
Don't believe what...

1355
01:16:18.128 --> 01:16:21.732
that he worked for me
or that I didn't kill him?

1356
01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:30.140
Well. what if I did. hmm?

1357
01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:33.344
What if he owed me
a shit ton of cash?

1358
01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:35.512
What are you gonna
do about it?

1359
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.182
You gonna fuck me up?

1360
01:16:38.215 --> 01:16:40.050
Avenge his death?

1361
01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:42.253
Go on. then.

1362
01:16:42.286 --> 01:16:44.388
Be as stupid as he was.

1363
01:16:48.025 --> 01:16:49.126
Fuck this!

1364
01:16:50.594 --> 01:16:52.429
<i>Holy shit.
I'm gonna die!</i>

1365
01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:54.331
<i>That's what I should be
thinking right about now.</i>

1366
01:16:54.365 --> 01:16:57.901
<i>but that's not what went
through my head in this moment.</i>

1367
01:16:57.935 --> 01:16:59.837
<i>What went through my head was.</i>

1368
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:02.439
<i>"If only the fat man
was skinny."</i>

1369
01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.395
<i>Well. this is it.</i>

1370
01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:01.198
<i>This is how my shit day ends.</i>

1371
01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:06.503
<i>What would you do...</i>

1372
01:18:06.537 --> 01:18:08.339
<i>pull the trigger for Dad?</i>

1373
01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:15.045
<i>Or would that make me
just like her?</i>

1374
01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:22.353
<i>She does deserve it.</i>

1375
01:18:29.393 --> 01:18:31.428
<i>Nah.</i>

1376
01:18:40.404 --> 01:18:41.572
<i>Shit. Marv!</i>

1377
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.576
Hey. hey. Marv.

1378
01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:48.879
- Is it over?
- Yeah. we gotta go.

1379
01:18:59.022 --> 01:19:01.125
- Guess it's possible. bro.
- What?

1380
01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:03.193
I think I got a limp
in both legs.

1381
01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:10.067
It's not what it looks like.

1382
01:19:13.437 --> 01:19:14.972
Wait. wait.

1383
01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:18.275
Wait. seriously.
we had nothing to do with this.

1384
01:19:18.308 --> 01:19:20.978
All we did was try
and pay back Spiggs.

1385
01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:22.212
This was all The Upholsterer.

1386
01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:25.416
She was saying Spiggs stole
something from her. and it...

1387
01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:27.184
got. like. kinda crazy.

1388
01:19:27.217 --> 01:19:29.987
and Marvin's been
shot in the leg. and...

1389
01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:33.390
I've got to get him
to a doctor pronto.

1390
01:19:34.091 --> 01:19:36.093
Hey.

1391
01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:38.629
Spiggs is dead. dudes.

1392
01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:42.533
That makes you in charge.
right?

1393
01:20:00.484 --> 01:20:01.952
We doing this or what?

1394
01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:03.420
Yeah. bro.

1395
01:20:04.455 --> 01:20:06.957
We don't take risks.

1396
01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.059
we get nowhere.

1397
01:20:09.092 --> 01:20:10.662
It's all good. bro.

1398
01:20:14.732 --> 01:20:16.500
I got this.

1399
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.384
<i>Marvin and me
never did find out</i>

1400
01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:36.721
<i>what the merchandise was.</i>

1401
01:20:37.387 --> 01:20:39.289
<i>but I still think about
what it might be</i>

1402
01:20:39.323 --> 01:20:40.758
<i>and where it might be.</i>

1403
01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:43.761
<i>Like. is it back at that motel?</i>

1404
01:20:44.294 --> 01:20:45.996
<i>Could be.</i>

1405
01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:48.432
<i>And I think about breaking in
and finding it.</i>

1406
01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:50.534
<i>but then I'm like.</i>

1407
01:20:50.567 --> 01:20:53.637
<i>"Nah. I never want to
go back into that room.</i>

1408
01:20:54.238 --> 01:20:56.674
<i>All those fullas
got killed over it."</i>

1409
01:20:57.742 --> 01:21:00.077
<i>So we're gonna stay on
the straight and narrow.</i>

1410
01:21:00.678 --> 01:21:03.013
<i>Yep. we got big plans.</i>

1411
01:21:03.413 --> 01:21:06.183
<i>I'm gonna turn this shit
around. Dad.</i>

1412
01:21:06.216 --> 01:21:07.752
<i>Make you proud</i>

1413
01:21:07.785 --> 01:21:10.087
<i>and show you I can do it.</i>

1414
01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:13.624
<i>They say there's dough
in pizzas if you get it right.</i>

1415
01:21:13.658 --> 01:21:15.526
<i>so me and Marv
are gonna learn the ropes.</i>

1416
01:21:15.559 --> 01:21:17.594
<i>save hard and start
our own franchise.</i>

1417
01:21:19.463 --> 01:21:22.165
<i>We're gonna be high on the hog.
