[Susan sighing]

10
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.910
Good morning.

11
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.995
Morning. baby.

12
00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:19.162
You were up late.

13
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.081
Just FaceTiming friends.

14
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.917
Get any packing done?

15
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.002
[exhales] Not yet.

16
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:28.005
You should start. Maybe
we can do some tomorrow.

17
00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.631
You really can't wait to
get rid of me.

18
00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:30.799
What?

19
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.300
No. that isn't it.

20
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.303
Are you sure? 'Cause
it kinda feels like it.

21
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.014
Still got a month before
school starts.

22
00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:38.974
I know.

23
00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.100
I just know that packing always
takes longer than you think

24
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.980
and I don't want you
panicking before you leave.

25
00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.108
I'll miss you every day.

26
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.987
It's gonna be really weird
not having you around here.

27
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.655
Having the house to myself.

28
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:57.576
Okay. I'll get on it. I promise.

29
00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.913
Don't worry. there's still
plenty of time for me to panic.

30
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.373
Smart ass.

31
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.918
Whoa. is this the place
you're showing today?

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.836
-All 70 acres.
-[gentle music]

33
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:11.131
This place is amazing.
Look at that view.

34
00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.800
Is that a movie theater?

35
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.384
Yes. it is an at-home
[post accent] theater.

36
00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.594
[chuckling]

37
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.263
This place was a
huge get for me.

38
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.349
I sell this. it'll move me into
the higher-end sales market.

39
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.061
Not to mention the
commission I'll net.

40
00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:25.854
You'll sell it. I know you will.

41
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.356
-This place sells itself.
-Mm. from your lips.

42
00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.820
How about we do dinner?

43
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.321
I'm done at five.

44
00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.823
Okay. what's up?

45
00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.574
What do you mean?

46
00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:39.534
We never go out
to dinner anymore.

47
00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.161
What's the occasion?

48
00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.538
Nothing. it's just...

49
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.125
we haven't spent
much time together

50
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.085
this summer and you're leaving.

51
00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.129
Besides. two ladies
can't go out on the town

52
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.296
and have some fun?

53
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.214
Okay. As long as
you're not

54
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.508
using me as
your wing woman.

55
00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.593
-[chuckling]
-Trust me.

56
00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.138
The only thing I'm in the
market for is some sushi.

57
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.016
[chuckles] Okay.
sounds great.

58
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.809
[kisses]
Good luck today.

59
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.810
You're gonna do great.

60
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:06.103
Thank you.

-[door closing]
-[brooding gentle music]

62
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.078
[Darren] So they finally
agreed to sell. huh?

63
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.663
Yep.

64
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.998
You have no idea how hard

65
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.248
I had to work
to convince them.

66
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.333
Oh. I'm sure.

67
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.751
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

68
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.046
Today's the first day on the
market. so you'll probably see

69
00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.048
a lot of cars around you
don't recognize.

70
00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.592
Well. I won't harass them too
much. No promises. though.

71
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.386
You know. a lot of the
folks around here

72
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.013
are gone for the weekend.

73
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.223
It's the dilemma of having
multiple houses. right?

74
00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.599
-I wouldn't know.
-[chuckles]

75
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.935
Hm. I've been up there
once or twice

76
00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.311
just to check on things.

77
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.604
That's a big piece of land.

78
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.689
Come on up if you have time.

79
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:51.940
I'll give you the tour.

80
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.192
Maybe you'll wanna
make an offer.

81
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.610
On my salary?
[chuckling]

82
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.445
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

-Paul. Paul.
-Sorry.

96
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.660
Didn't mean to scare you.

97
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:13.040
Just wanted to check in.

98
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.542
Make sure you didn't need
anything before the big day.

99
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.419
I'm good! As ready as I can be.

100
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.421
Smell that?

101
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:22.132
Pine trees?

102
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:24.092
Multiple offers.
over asking.

103
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.220
That's what that is.

104
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.472
You know. I still don't know
how you convinced them to sell.

105
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.893
I've been trying to bag
this listing for years.

106
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.769
I told them how hot
the market is.

107
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.980
what I would do to
help them sell.

108
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.607
I think they just really
wanted to hear the truth.

109
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.400
Really? That worked?

110
00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.569
I'll have to try it sometime.

111
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.445
[chuckles]

112
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.866
I can pretty persuasive
when I have to be.

113
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.161
I'm sure you can.

114
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:54.373
You know. I'm looking forward
to having you on the team.

115
00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:57.792
After this sells. we'll get
your home on the market.

116
00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.171
Ah. maybe not
quite so fast.

117
00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:03.924
I just wanna get Heather
settled at school first.

118
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.843
-You still haven't told her?
-[ominous music]

119
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:11.223
I don't know how to. It's the
only home she's ever known.

120
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:15.143
I get it. I know how much
it means to you.

121
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.397
But don't let it
hold you captive.

122
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.274
You know. like we
tell our clients.

123
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:23.568
"It's what fills a house
that makes it a home."

124
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.447
Besides. from what
you've told me.

125
00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:30.033
she seems like
a smart kid.

126
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:34.037
She'll understand and she'll
want what's best for you.

127
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.373
We're supposed to have
dinner tonight

128
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:37.749
after the open house.

129
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.459
I'm planning on
telling her tonight.

130
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.752
You should.

131
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:41.920
It'll give her time
to enjoy it

132
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.546
before she leaves.

133
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:46.507
Besides. you don't wanna
miss the market.

134
00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:50.095
Speaking of. I've got my
own appointment to get to.

135
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.098
But check in with me
before the end of the day.

136
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.016
I wanna hear how much
they love the place.

137
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.226
Sure thing. boss!

138
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.025
[Heather] I swear!
It's like she's pushing
me out the door.

139
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.526
-I'm sure that's not it.
-It is!

140
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.821
It's like she can't wait
to get rid of me.

141
00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.281
[panting]

142
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.449
Did you talk to her about it?

143
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.450
No.

144
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.742
You should.

145
00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.035
Let her know
that's how you feel.

146
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.872
I just don't get why she's
so eager for me to go.

147
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.001
It's probably just a defense
mechanism. Think about it.

148
00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.920
First. your dad. Now you
heading off to college?

149
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.755
I mean. she's about
to be alone

150
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.966
for the first time
in over 20 years.

151
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.468
That's huge.

152
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.220
Talk to her about it.

153
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.305
[sighing] I will.

154
00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.806
We're having dinner tonight.

155
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.557
-Thanks. you're the best.
-Oh. I know.

156
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.060
I keep telling people I deserve
my own daytime talk show.

157
00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.813
-but they don't listen.
-[laughing]

158
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.690
-One more lap?
-Sure.

159
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.775
[doorbell ringing]

160
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.320
-Welcome! I'm Susan.
-[gentle music]

161
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:49.737
Come in.

162
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.659
A total of 6.000 square feet.

163
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.204
and every amenity that
you can imagine.

164
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.376
The game room. The pool
and shuffle board table

165
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.877
come with the house.

166
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.005
Great way to keep the
kids occupied for hours.

167
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.673
A temperature-controlled
wine cellar.

168
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.468
capable of holding
over 1.000 bottles.

169
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.303
The original property
was a winery.

170
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.597
so much of what you see
here is personal reserve.

171
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.642
Here's the master bedroom.

172
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.729
complete with a giant
en suite bathroom.

173
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.861
Its own at-home theater
with built-in surround sound

174
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.446
and Wi-fi for streaming.

175
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.616
And all of it guarded by
a high-end security system

176
00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.536
and wireless
surveillance cameras.

177
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.039
with an intercom system

I know. but I had
Tracy drop me.

197
00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.916
I had to see this
place for myself.

198
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.793
Wow.

199
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.421
This place is. like.

I know. it's really something.

202

So?

211
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.281
We passed a whole slew of
police cars on our way here.

212
00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.033
They're going all around
the neighborhood.

213
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.202
[Susan] Something happened.
that's for sure.

214

Looks like it.

222
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.983
It's after five. I'll
tell them to come back.

223
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.652

May as well show 'em. Who knows?

226
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.949
Could be the people
that grossly overpay.

227
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.493
You wanna do the showing?

-Nope. it's all you.

231
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.348
Hi. We hope we're
not too late.

232
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.017
We were just driving by
it and we had to stop.

233
00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.686
Showings ended at five.

234
00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:53.064

This is the main living area.

239
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:09.539
It has an open floor plan that
leads right to the kitchen.

240
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.082
Wow.

241
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.500
Look at this place.

Are you all right?
You're sweating.

That's the third
siren I've heard.

248
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.355
We didn't notice anything.

249
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.942

Have you seen many properties?

257
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:21.110
Uh. a few. but nothing
we've loved yet.

258
00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.029
Well. it's hard not to
love this one.

259
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.033
There's five bedrooms. four
baths. Sits on 70 acres of land.

260
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:30.745
As you saw on the way up.
privacy isn't an issue.

to work out the kinks.

use one now.

gonna hurt you.

I think we've taken
enough chances for one day.

297

So all that's
because of you?

298
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.599
We just need a place
to lay low for a while.

must've left it.

Where is she?

321

My guess? Probably halfway
to those cops by now.

322
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:51.667
If you leave right now.
you might be able to get away.

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.597
[Susan] Get your hands off her.

359
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.684
[cable tie zipping]

360
00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:58.145

[cable tie zipping]

362
00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:12.993
Before you tie me up. we should
probably take care of that.

363
00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:20.167
You're obviously not making it
to a hospital any time soon.

364
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.877
You're losing blood.

365
00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:28.259
Not to mention you're sort of
bleeding all over the carpet.

366
00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:30.594
There's a first aid
kit in my car.

367
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:38.185
-[Keith groaning]
-[Natalie sighing]

368
00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:39.437
I'll go.

369
00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:41.647
They do anything stupid.

370
00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:44.150
[chuckling] make 'em
pay for it.

371
00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:49.029
[Keith groaning]

372
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:03.501
[keys jingling]

373
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.674
We should move the cars.
Put 'em out of sight.

374
00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.384
Just in case.

375
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.139
Anything else?

376
00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:26.650
I know you're both scared.

377
00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:29.820
Just cooperate and
no one will get hurt.

378
00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.156
Be a lot easier to believe

379
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.074
if you weren't
covered in blood.

380
00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:37.661
[tense orchestral music]

381
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.339
For the record. this was
never part of the plan.

382
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.632
So there was a plan?

383
00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:52.885
There's always a plan.

384
00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:55.971
and it always goes off
without a hitch.

385
00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:58.516
This seems to be
a pretty big hitch.

386
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:07.066
[distant siren wailing]

387
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:16.200
[garage door humming]

388
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.706
Why are you helping me?

389
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.041
I'm not.

390
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.751
I'm helping us.

391
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.713
Honestly. your partner
is a little on edge.

392
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:33.217
and I'm afraid what she might
do if you lose consciousness.

393
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:39.432
-[footsteps approach]
-[tense gentle music]

394
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:43.102
Anything else. Your Highness?

395
00:26:45.563 --> 00:26:47.647
I guess just some towels.

396
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:51.485
[Natalie scoffing]

397
00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:57.491
I need you to take that off.

398
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:02.620
[Keith groaning]

399
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.417
Let me help.

400
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:10.003
[Keith groaning]

401
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:15.633
Here.

402
00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:22.433
[Keith groaning]

403
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:23.976
[Susan] All right. well.

404
00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.186
the good news is the
bullet went right through.

405
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:31.066
Bad news is we have
two holes to stitch.

406
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:33.068
[sighing]

407
00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:46.081

[ominous tones]

[tense suspenseful music]

410
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:02.556
[phone ringing]

411
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.600
Wow. your husband's annoying.

412
00:28:04.642 --> 00:28:06.810
This is the third
time he's called.

413
00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:09.355
Sorry. Paul.

414
00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.857
He's my boss. I'm not married.

415
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:17.196
Divorced?

416
00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:20.740
Widowed.

417
00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:24.328
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:26.997
He's asking how
the showings went.

419
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.748
[scoffs] Typical.

420
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.584
All about the money.

421
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:33.337
You should let me text him
back so he doesn't worry.

422
00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:37.550
No. No contact.

423
00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.302
I can't be sure you
won't slip him a message

424
00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:41.428
and tip him off.

425
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:47.726
This is gonna hurt.

426
00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:49.311
Worse than a gunshot?
[chuckles]

427
00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:58.529
[grunting]

428
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.034
[grunting]

429
00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:10.874
I didn't know you could do that.

430
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.669
Sew? Are you kidding?

431
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:16.547
When you were little. I used
to stitch all your clothes.

432
00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:22.135
Your father and I didn't
have much when we started.

433
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.470
[Natalie scoffing]

434
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:24.763
Right.

435
00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:28.892
You think I don't know
what it's like to struggle?

436
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.310
To worry?

437
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:33.897
Worry about what?

438
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:36.858
Buying your next $2.000 bag?

439
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.902
You don't think I know
what that's worth?

440
00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:42.281
You know. [sighs] folks like
you. your idea of being broke

441
00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:45.534
is having to skimp on
your yearly trip to Cabo.

442
00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:47.911
We've never been to Cabo.

443
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.829
[Natalie chuckling]

444
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.457
The point is...

445
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.834
You're entitled.

446
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:58.797
You guys live in these big
mansions behind giant gates

447
00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:01.216
and your private security?

448
00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:03.510
The haves and have-mores.

449
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:05.596
You know. always helping each
other. while everyone else

450
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:08.474
outside of the gates has
to fight for what's left.

451
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:12.811
For scraps.

452
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:16.982
[scoffs] We're just
evening the score
a little.

453
00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:18.858
Hey.

454
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.946
Can we debate ethics later
and let the woman focus?

455
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:28.702
Not everything's what it seems.

456
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:32.790
I'm just trying to make
a living. provide for my family.

457
00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:35.208
And the bag's a knockoff.

458
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:42.716
[Keith breathing deeply]

459
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.136
That's one.

-[intercom buzzing]
-[tense music]

461
00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:52.851
That's the security gate.

00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:56.396
[Keith groaning]

463
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.904
[intercom buzzing]

464
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.824
[Keith] It's a cop.

465
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.241
Ignore him. He'll go away.

466
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:10.035
With everything going
on out there.

467
00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:11.662
do you really think that?

468
00:31:11.704 --> 00:31:13.831
[intercom buzzing]

469
00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:16.375
He's obviously not leaving.

470
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:22.506
I can get rid of him.
but we have to let him up.

471
00:31:22.548 --> 00:31:24.883
We can't. Like. why
would we trust you?

472
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:27.511
Think it through.

473
00:31:27.553 --> 00:31:29.638
He obviously saw the lights.

474
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.516
If we don't answer.
he's gonna call it in.

475
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:34.184
Where does that go?

476
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.603
More cops surrounding the house.

477
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.649
You think I want
my child caught in that?

478
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.446
I'll convince him.

479
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.365
[intercom buzzing]

480
00:31:49.616 --> 00:31:52.411
Fine. but. you let him in here.

481
00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:55.789
it's going to end very bad.
I will make sure of it.

482
00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.009
Hello?

Officer.

488
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.193
Can I help you?

489
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:27.696
Is everything okay. ma'am?
I was buzzing for a while.

490
00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:30.741
[Susan] Sorry. I was
out back on the phone.

491
00:32:31.617 --> 00:32:33.619
We're going door to door.
checking the neighborhood.

492
00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:36.789
It's a little late for
an open house.

493
00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.750
That ended at five.
[chuckling]

494
00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:43.796
Guess I just got drawn into
some work calls and emails.

495
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.005
Lost track of time.

496
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:50.928
Also. it's quieter here.
No kids.

[tense ominous music]

499
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:58.894
Uh. I keep hearing sirens.

500
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:00.395
Did something happen?

501
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:02.773
There was a break-in
down the street.

502
00:33:02.815 --> 00:33:04.858
-Really?
-[officer sighing]

503
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.693
It's not the first
that we've had lately.

504
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:09.488
Seems to be the same pair that's
been doing this for months.

505
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.949
Well. I hope no one was hurt.

506
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.617
I'm afraid so.

507
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.244
The intruders killed
the homeowner.

508
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.497
Killed?

509
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:21.917
From what we can tell.
he caught 'em in the act.

510
00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:23.961
We think he wounded one of them.

511
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:28.882
Have you noticed anything
unusual tonight?

512
00:33:29.925 --> 00:33:31.677
Anyone you didn't recognize?

513
00:33:31.718 --> 00:33:35.514
Honestly. dozens of
people came through.

514
00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:36.807
All strangers.

515

[indistinct police

516
00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:44.773
Are you sure everything's okay.
ma'am?

517
00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:56.242
Yeah. um...
[chuckling]

518
00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:58.912
You're just kinda
freakin' me out a little.

519
00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:04.042
Uh. I am. I'm definitely gonna
go straight home. ASAP.

520
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:05.752
That's a good idea.

521
00:34:05.794 --> 00:34:08.005
Just so you know.
the neighborhood's
been cordoned off.

522
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.464
so you have to pass
through a police checkpoint

523
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.090
on your way out.

524
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:12.258
Checkpoint.

525
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.844
Got it.

526
00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:15.679
Thank you for letting me know.

527
00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.848
-[Officer] You get home safe.
-[radio chatter]

528
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.432
I will.

529
00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:21.018
You be safe out there.

530
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:25.939
Hold on. Did you hurt yourself?

531
00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:35.448
[Susan chuckling]

532
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.659
I am such a klutz.

533
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.536
Bloody Mary mix.

534
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:43.206
I've been serving them all
day to potential buyers.

535
00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:45.124
You have no idea what
you have to do

536
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.002

What that cop said.

555
00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.635
You killed the owner
of that other house.

556
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:21.680
Not me.

557
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:23.348
She had to.

558
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:26.893
But not before he
got a shot off.

559
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.687
Lucky me. right?

Luckier than him.

No one was supposed
to come home.

562
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:36.194
And there were never
guns. That was my rule.

563
00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:42.993
I open things.

Not before today.

568
00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:54.046
I didn't even know she had one.

569
00:36:54.087 --> 00:36:56.882
Maybe she just didn't
bother to tell you about it.

This isn't just
a robbery anymore.

It's murder.

And now we've seen your faces.

576
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.068
Do you really think she's
just gonna let us go?

577
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:18.653
I told you that wasn't
supposed to happen.

578
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:20.906
and we certainly don't
plan on adding to it.

579
00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:23.616
Like you said. how
much of tonight's

580
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.577
gone according to the plan?

581
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:28.163

to hear from you.

the cop said. okay?

All the surrounding roads
outside are blocked. so for now.

we just sit tight
and stay chill.

585
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.175
That's easy for him to say.

586
00:37:40.217 --> 00:37:42.385
He wasn't the one who was shot.

587
00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:45.889
Give him some time. okay?
He'll figure something out.

588

have options.

Why don't you stop talking and
focus on what you're doing?

choices you can make.

716
00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:38.277
[thud]

717
00:45:39.529 --> 00:45:41.573
[Susan] Paul. Paul!

718
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:43.115
[groaning]

719
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:44.367
Paul.

720
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:47.078
-[Paul grunting]
-Paul.

721
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.914
[Paul] Susan?

722
00:45:49.955 --> 00:45:51.957
Sorry I haven't
called you back.

723
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:55.002
Are you okay?

724
00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:56.671
For now.

725
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.007
[chuckling]
Good. you're awake.

726
00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:02.510
You know. for the record.
if someone doesn't answer.

727
00:46:02.552 --> 00:46:04.803
wait for them to call you back.

728
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:07.473
Otherwise. it's annoying.

729
00:46:09.058 --> 00:46:10.602
You're the home invasion thieves

730
00:46:10.643 --> 00:46:13.145
the police are looking for.

731
00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:15.856
Handsome and smart.
[chuckling]

732
00:46:15.898 --> 00:46:17.442
Okay.

733
00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.026
Let's talk.

734
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.069
How much do you want?

735
00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:21.153
[scoffs]

736
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.615
Wow. [scoffs]

737
00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:25.074
Blunt.

738
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.118
Is that your winning
negotiating style. Paul?

739
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.579
I like to think
it's direct.

740
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:32.540
-and so far it's served me well.
-[tense ominous music]

741
00:46:32.582 --> 00:46:34.333
So what's it gonna cost?

742
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.501
What are you doing?

743
00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:37.044
Negotiating.

744
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:39.213
Watch and learn.

745
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:40.881
Typical.

746
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:42.300
Thinking you can just

747
00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:43.718
deal your way out
of any problem.

748
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:47.764
Almost everything in
life is a negotiation.

749
00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.641
Certainly this is.

750
00:46:49.682 --> 00:46:53.852
You're thieves. So deep
down. you want money.

751
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:57.982
You're only here because you
need somewhere to hide. right?

752
00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:03.655
That means none of us wants
to be here. Let's start there.

753
00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:07.824
What can we do to satisfy
both parties? Make an offer.

754
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:09.118
Unbelievable.

755
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.411
There's always
a deal to be made.

756
00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:11.746
a number! What is it?

757
00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:16.000
Or maybe there's not.

758
00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:22.632
-[suspenseful tense music]
-[Paul panting]

759
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.385
Play this smart! I'm offering
you real money here!

760
00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:27.804
Cash in your pocket!

761
00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.681
Please. stop!

762
00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:32.057
There's a price for everything.
Name it!

763
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:33.726
Is that so?

764
00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:37.355
Tell me. Paul. What's
the price for your life?

765
00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:38.606
50.000.

766
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.067
Get us 50.000 and we'll go.

767
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.319
Done!

768
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:48.449
[tense music]

769
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.910
What the hell are you doing?

770
00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:54.246
What you couldn't-- saving us.

771
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:56.666
-You're welcome.
-You can't trust them.

772
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:58.417
They killed someone.

773
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:01.086
We've seen their faces.

774
00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:02.963
You really think they're
gonna let us go?

775
00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:05.341
For money? Yeah. I do.

776
00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.051
Even thieves have
a code of honor.

777
00:48:07.092 --> 00:48:08.720
Is that what you tell yourself?

778
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.555
Let me give you a little
trade secret. Susan.

779
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.682
There's always
a deal to be made.

780
00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:15.100
Maybe if you realized that.
you'd be better at your job.

781
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:17.562
Maybe you wouldn't be
losing your house.

782
00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.730
Yeah.

783
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:21.858
He's exactly how you
described him.

784
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:24.736
[Natalie chuckling]

785
00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:25.820
Here's the problem. Paul.

786
00:48:25.862 --> 00:48:27.029
We've got more than that

787
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:28.406
in the trunk of our car
downstairs.

788
00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:32.660
That's all I can transfer
without a delay of funds.

789
00:48:32.702 --> 00:48:34.412
And besides. are you
saying you couldn't use

790
00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:35.830
an extra $50.000?

791
00:48:36.581 --> 00:48:38.165
And what? You think
you're just gonna

792
00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:39.916
drive us out of here
that easy?

793
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.586
That's exactly what I'll do.

794
00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:43.546
I'll tell the cops at the
checkpoint you're my clients

795
00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:46.173
and I was showing
you a property.

796
00:48:46.215 --> 00:48:47.508
At night?

797
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.218
That won't be suspicious?

798
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.553
It happens all the time.

799
00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:52.764
People wanna see the lights.
the view.

800
00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:55.683
[chuckling] Especially
a house like this.

801
00:48:55.725 --> 00:48:58.644
Once we're clear.
I'll transfer the money.

802
00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:00.479
You can even take my car.

803
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:04.024
and we'd never have to
see each other again.

804
00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:07.612
[stammers] I'd appreciate it
if you leave it intact.

805
00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:08.987
It's a lease.

806
00:49:09.029 --> 00:49:11.073
[Natalie chuckling]

807
00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.785
Take the offer.
It gives you what you want.

808
00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:16.495
A safe way out
and money for the baby.

809
00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:19.998
[eerie suspenseful music]

810
00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:26.088
I need to make a call.

811
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.715
Watch him.

812
00:49:29.759 --> 00:49:31.260
You didn't know.

813
00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:35.598
That's the second thing they
left you in the dark about.

814
00:49:37.892 --> 00:49:40.311
Okay. fine. You have a deal.

815
00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:42.396
-Let's move.
-[opens knife]

816
00:49:42.438 --> 00:49:44.816
You might wanna lose that shirt.

817
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:46.776
There's a box of
clothes in my car.

818
00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:48.985
My husband's.
I was donating them.

819
00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:50.822
You might be able to
find something that fits.

820
00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:53.866
Yeah and get the rest of our
stuff while you're at it.

821
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:00.498
[tense music]

822
00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.124
You're getting rid
of Dad's stuff?

823
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:07.212
I was just...
cleaning things up.

824
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.842
Sounds more like you
were clearing it out.

825
00:50:11.884 --> 00:50:14.512
He's not gonna need
them anymore. honey.

826
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:49.797
Something wrong?

827
00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:52.591
That was one of
his favorite shirts.

828
00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:54.719
Thank you.

829
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.595
Okay.

830
00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:58.014
Say goodbye.

831
00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:02.058
[opens knife]

832
00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:05.938
[tense music]

833
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.566
I'll be back as soon
as they set me free.

834
00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:11.318
I'll be okay.

835
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:25.123
This is how I like
to do business.

836
00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:28.961
With people who have clear
goals and don't play games.

837
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:31.213
Honey. swivel your chair around.

838
00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.298
-[suspenseful music]
-Back to back. just do it.

839
00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:42.098
-When were you gonna tell me?
-About what?

840
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.726
About the house and selling it?

841
00:51:43.768 --> 00:51:45.937
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

842
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:48.188
I saw the flyer on your laptop.

843
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.273
Were you even gonna tell me?

844
00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:50.315
Of course!

845
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:51.859
Now is not the time.

846
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:53.819
We have bigger things to
worry about right now.

847
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:55.821
Might be our only time.

848
00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:58.908
Don't talk like that.
We're gonna be okay.

849
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.159
We don't know that.

850
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:03.621
We will if I have
anything to say about it.

851
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:05.039
Get closer.

852
00:52:11.712 --> 00:52:12.797
Yeah.

853
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:15.173

[D]<i> Transfer the money now.</i>

857
00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.934
That wasn't our agreement.

858

<i>Consider this a renegotiation.</i>
<i>Transfer the money.</i>

859
00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:32.650
I'm sorry. but those
terms are unacceptable.

860
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:34.485
Once I get us past
the checkpoint.

861
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:37.029
I'll make the transfer
as we agreed.

862
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:38.154
I'm good for it.

864
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:41.492
I'm not going to do that.

865
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.576
If you'll just abide by

866
00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.078
our original agreement.

867
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.412

Yes. [grunts]

me after I make the transfer?

That's not good.

On the north end of the
property. there's a side gate.

It empties out into
a drainage ditch.

you run for it.

More than just
a pretty face.

You're how they knew who to rob.

These people pay you
to protect them.

987
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.378
I do protect them.

988
01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.590
I make sure they're not home
when we break into the place.

Until today. you mean.

Mm.

991
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.179
That was unfortunate.

992
01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.849
But they pay me...

993
01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.395
to protect this.

994
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.188

Mm.

The rest of them

1002
01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:12.669
barely make eye contact.

1003
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.712
Do you know why?

1004
01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.549
Because on the
rare occasion

1005
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.344
that they do bother
to look at me.

1006
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.639
they see me as beneath them.

Some blue-collar schlub

1008
01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:29.561

worthy to acknowledge.

1009

Do you know how many
weekends I have spent

1010
01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:37.528
doing odd jobs

1011
01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:39.655
on the side for these people?

Hanging holidays lights
or fixing gutters?

1013
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.788
And every time. every time!

1014
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.332
They complain.

1015
01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.335
They try to pay less
than we agreed upon.

1016
01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.588
Renegotiating the price.
after the job is done.

1017
01:01:56.630 --> 01:02:00.509
Trying to skimp out on the bill
and screw the little guy.

1018
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:03.803
So that makes it all right
to take what's not yours?

1019
01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.722
I'm taking what they owe me.

1020
01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:08.808
Besides. this is all insured.

1021
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.477

[chuckles]

1023
01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:15.982
These people can stand
to learn a lesson or two.

1024
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.402
So what lesson do you
think you're teaching them?

1025
01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.738
That they have way more
than they'll ever need.

1026
01:02:21.779 --> 01:02:24.616
And physical things
don't matter.

1027
01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.035
If they don't matter then
why are you stealing them?

1028
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.206
From the mouth of
a suburban princess.

1029
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:36.378
Tell me. what Ivy
League university

1030

will you be attending this year?

1031
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.632
You don't know
anything about me.

1032
01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.926
I know your type.

1033
01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.928
I get ignored by them every day.

1034
01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:49.266
They turn away without
even bothering to wave.

1035
01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:52.102
Maybe that's because
they think you're a creep.

1036
01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.398
I can be real sweet.

1037
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.568
-Get your hands off of her!

You're just lumping us
into your story

1040
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.406

If she does that again.

1047

Sorry about that.

1053
01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.975
Got a little bit
of a squelch there.

1054

Uh. all clear on my side.
I am still out on patrol.

1055

Though I don't
exactly know why

1056

Let me know when
they're all clear.

1063

Looks like we're out of
here sooner than we thought.

1065

-Not bad for a day's work.
-Yeah?

You're not sporting
a bullet hole.

There are always risks.
We knew that.

1070

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.401
There wasn't supposed to be.

1074
01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.363
And him owning a gun? You
didn't know about that either?

1075
01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:27.905
It must've been new.

1076
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.700
It's not like they tell
me everything.

1077
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:31.242
I know how that feels.

1078
01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.288
Something on your mind?

1079
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.041
Natalie?

1080
01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:39.292
The guns?

1081
01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.504
It was a precaution.

1082
01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.881
And I'd say you're
pretty lucky she had it.

1083
01:04:44.922 --> 01:04:48.092
No weapons.
That was our agreement.

1084
01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.470
That was my rule.

1085
01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:52.806
Yeah. well your rule had
to go out the window.

1086
01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:55.975
in order to score
something this big.

1087
01:04:56.017 --> 01:05:00.271
You wanna raise the score.
we had to up our game.

1088
01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.524
That comes with risks.

1089
01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:04.317
Besides. what difference
would it have made?

1090
01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.778
-I'd have quit.

1091

This wasn't part of the plan.

1092

Once we get out of this.
I take my cut and I'm out.

1093
01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.203
You two can go form
your happy family.

1094
01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.874
Oh. yeah.

1095
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.334
There's something else you
forgot to tell me about.

[somber orchestral music]

1097
01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.231
You should've told me
about the house.

1098
01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.149
I wanted to.

1099
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.318
I just didn't know how.

1100
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.153
I was gonna tell you
at dinner tonight.

1101
01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.281
That's why you're
rushing me out.

1102
01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:52.908
I just thought it
might be easier

1103
01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:56.661
when you were settled at
school. with a new life.

1104
01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.038
Then it might hurt less.

1105
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.375
After everything we've been
through. I just wanted you

1106
01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:05.462
to hold onto being a teenager
for a little longer.

-[door closing]
-[ominous music]

1113
01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:28.359

in case we run into any trouble.

1115
01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:33.239
No. That was never in the plan.

1117
01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:37.327
Besides. we need one
of them for insurance.

1118
01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:40.455
I said no.

1119
01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.626
Okay.

1120
01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.043
We'll put it to a vote.

1121
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:49.213
So far we have one
for and one against.

1122
01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.382
Baby. you're up.

1123
01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.390
It's just a precaution.

1124
01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.644
Like I said. it's gonna be
fine. They're for insurance.

1125

Okay. Yeah. no. let's take one.

1126
01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:08.733

1127

Take me.

1128

See. I'm gonna go with her.
because that way I know

you're not gonna do
anything to jeopardize us.

1130

[Keith] We don't need her!

1131

I can't.

What do you think's
about to happen?

1138
01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:55.321
This is about to get very bad.

1139
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.866
Trust me. I know when
a deal's gone south.

1140
01:07:57.908 --> 01:07:59.325
I've had my share.

1141

I'll protect her.

I'll keep her safe. I promise.

1143
01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:08.209
You're not even safe.
It's two against one!

1144

Think about it.
Think about everything

1145

that's gone wrong tonight.

1146
01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:15.299
Do you really think

1147
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.385
he didn't know the owner
would come home?

What's changed since then?

What else didn't they
tell you about?

1153

They have something to fight
for. Each other. their baby.

him at the house. huh?

1157
01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:41.200
Let the cops find him.

1158
01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:43.411
That was the plan.
remember? Close the loop.

Yeah. I know!

1160
01:08:44.704 --> 01:08:46.081
It's bad enough that the cops

1161
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.874
already suspect
neighborhood security.

1162
01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:50.543
What did you want me to do.
okay? The plans changed.

1163
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:54.672

you said. but he had a gun.

about it either.
