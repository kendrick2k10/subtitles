3
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.130
Okay.

4
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.383
-Okay.

5
00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.182
Anything?

6
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.809
Give us a chance. babe.

7
00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:42.645
Are you telling me

8
00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.021
all that incredible sex
was for nothing?

9
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:49.109
Have you put the rice on?

10
00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.321
-Yes. chef.
-Yeah. not too much.

11
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.281
Oh. fuck!

12
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:59.245
Hmm. Well. we know
it's not your eggs.

13
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:03.290
It's my boys. They just...
need a bit of get-up-and-go.

14
00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:06.293
We can try the frozen peas
on my bollocks again.

15
00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:08.504
The most humiliating night
of my life.

16
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.131
I remember that.
Was that even a thing?

17
00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:13.884
God knows. Anyway. who needs kids?

18
00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.094
Can't go to the pub.

19
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:18.013
can't go on holiday.
You can't get stoned.

20
00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:21.016
And our sex life will be
me wanking six nights a week.

21
00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:24.520
Twice on Sundays.

22
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.649
Hey. little baby. don't you cry

23
00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.151
Mamma's gonna buy you a...

24
00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.947
House in a gentrified part of London

25
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.658
It's all right to be
a little bit wobbly. babe.

26
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.119
-Hmm?
-I'm not wobbly.

27
00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:41.871
-Yeah. you are.
-No. I'm not.

28
00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:43.747
I know you. you are.

29
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.129
It's always been you and me
versus the rest of the world.

30
00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:54.049
And soon it might be you...

31
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.510
and me...

32
00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:59.388
and it
versus the rest of the world.

33
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.265
Oh. God.
they don't stand a chance.

34
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.725
-No. they don't.

35
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.612
The moment of truth.

36
00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:17.364
Okay.

37
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.760
No?

38
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:40.846
Yeah.

39
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:44.016
-No.

40
00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:48.520
-Holy shit! Yes!

41
00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.356
Careful. careful. careful!
I'm pregnant!

42
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.775
-Oh. my God. Call your mum.
-I said it out loud.

43
00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:54.693
-I'm... I'm pregnant.
-We need to get champagne.

44
00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:56.153
I know. I...
I can't drink any more.

45
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.696
Well.
alcohol-free fizzy. then.

46
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.199
Oh. my God.
you are fucking amazing!

47
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.325
-Mwah!

48
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.244
-You're amazing!
-Oh. my God. okay. Um...

49
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.496
Either way. this means
one of my boys

50
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.373
got through. I am a man!

51
00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.124
Okay. I need to go
and do it again.

52
00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:10.334
I need to go and call my mum.

53
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.211
I'm gonna go and do it again.

54
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:14.713
-We're having a baby.
-I'm pregnant.

55
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.174
-I love you.
-I love you.

56
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.219
Oh. my God.

57
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.222
Oh. fuck.

58
00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.865
Excuse me. Mate.

59
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.742
Yeah. you.

60
00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:45.494
Sorry for calling you
a wanker yesterday.

61
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.329
-That's all right...
-Got any blow?

62
00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:49.415
Uh. no. No. I don't...

63
00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:52.543
Mate. what's wrong?
I can't ask a question?

64
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.258
Fucking anti-social. man.
Am I right?

65
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.605
Excuse me. mate.
What's that. champagne?

66
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.607
What. you rich. mate?

67
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.777
Excuse me! Mate!

68
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.362
Yo!

69
00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:22.906
What. are you
the Secret Millionaire?

70
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.658
You gonna answer me or what.
wanker?

71
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:27.036
It's not champagne.
it's fucking prosecco. Okay?

72
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.495
Non-alcoholic.

73
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:31.790
My girlfriend's pregnant.
so go fuck yourself. Okay?

74
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.468
-Honey. I'm home!

75
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.011
Got the bubbly-wubbly.

76
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.846
Good. babe.
Because I'm definitely.

77
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:46.930
definitely pregnant.

78
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.099
Have you called your mum?
She's gonna go mental.

79
00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.684
Oh. shit. Yeah. no.
I need to call her now.

80
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.227
-Go fuck myself?

81
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.104
-No. no. no. no!
-Babe?

82
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.067
-Oh. my God.

83
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:01.945
No. please. Please. stop!

84
00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.618
Hi. uh. is that the police?

85
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.786
Uh. yeah. I need someone

86
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.245
to come. um.
right now. please.

87
00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:11.872
-Um. there's...

88
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:16.543
There's a break-in. Yeah.
it's. um. 115 Duncombe Road...

89
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.881
-Help! Help!

90
00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.841
Help!

91
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.469
-No. please. she's pregnant!

92
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.812
Whoo!

93
00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:38.982
Get away! Get away from me!

94
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.071
Whoo!

95
00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:48.826
Is that right?
You up the spout?

96
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.417
Well. go on. then. Do it!

97
00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:04.842
Let's find out if you're
really nice... or nasty.

98
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:13.976
That's it. girl.

99
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:20.774
Shit. feds!
Fam. come on! Come on!

100
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.155
Nice girl. then. Shame. that.

101
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.168
Jamie...

102
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.388
My God. It's so green.

103
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.056
Slight change from the estate.

104
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.350
Yeah. Just a bit.

105
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:02.728
Look. I don't
want to be the fun police.

106
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.521
but you have to stop smiling
all the time.

107
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.940
I can't help it.
It's just... gorgeous.

108
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:09.109
Your Aunt Maeve
has just died. remember?

109
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.736
I... I know. I know.

110
00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.905
But she's left us a house
with a huge garden.

111
00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:15.157
Yeah. I get it. babe.

112
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.701
but have a little dignity
in your grief.

113
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.662
Ah. Just happy. And... and sad.

114
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.635
There's milk in the fridge.

115
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.221
and I made sure you had
a full canister of gas.

116
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.640
God forbid you should start
your new life in a house

117
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.934
where you can't boil a kettle
for a cup of tea.

118
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.310
We have an actual septic tank.

119
00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:27.312
We are proper
country bumpkins.

120
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:31.191
He's so easily pleased.
Um. what about the roof?

121
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.609
Oh. no. I can sort that.

122
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.362
You can't change a light bulb
without getting vertigo. babe.

123
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.655
We'll get a professional.

124
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.573
-I'll email you some names.
-Great. thank you.

125
00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:40.367
Thanks. Niamh.
you've been amazing.

126
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.119
-Oh. no bother. sure.
-Seriously.

127
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:46.498
Maeve wanted to keep the place
in your family. Jamie.

128
00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.418
And she'd have loved you.
Maya.

129
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.253
Did you know her well?

130
00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:56.049
As well as anyone could.
which is to say... not very.

131
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.302
She was a funny one. Maeve.

132
00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.225
There is one more thing
I need to show you.

133
00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.310
and it's a little bit...

134
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.730
little bit peculiar.

135
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:16.903
Yeah. I came on holiday
here loads as a kid.

136
00:12:16.987 --> 00:12:18.363
It was good times.

137
00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:20.991
I remember you.
All freckles and elbows.

138
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.994
running round like a cat
with its tail on fire.

139
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.705
chasing bees and butterflies.

140
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.332
Aunt Maeve was always
giving me sweets.

141
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.543
Club chocolate bars.
Do you remember them?

142
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:35.422
I think she used to spoil me
because she never had kids.

143
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.133
Oh. yeah.

144
00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.178
I remember this.

145
00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.431
Aunt Maeve would never let me
go in there.

146
00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:46.600
Can we go through there?

147
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.560
Do we... do we own the wood
as well?

148
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.355
Maeve believed
in the old ways.

149
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.400
Every evening. before sunset.

150
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:57.569
she'd leave
a blood offering here.

151
00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.279
Sorry. did you say blood?

152
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.908
Well. not like
the Aztec fellas

153
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:06.286
ripping their hearts
out of their chests. No. no.

154
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.625
She'd leave a little slice
of liver or some such.

155
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.586
For who?

156
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.340
-The Little People.
-Leprechauns?

157
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.884
Brilliant. Oh. I love it.
It's so Irish.

158
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.887
Not leprechauns. exactly.

159
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:29.309
Some call them the Far Darrig.
or the Redcaps.

160
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:33.104
So she thought that
these leprechauns. um...

161
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.273
sorry. Little People.
lived in that wood?

162
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.443
Maeve's was a life of sorrow.

163
00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.489
She did have a child.
but one she...

164
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.909
Oh. no. please. tell us.

165
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.038
Her husband. a young man.

166
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.499
funny fella.
like yourself. Jamie...

167
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.793
he passed first.

168
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.836
Pneumonia.

169
00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.130
Then the child.

170
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.217
-Maeve blamed herself.
-Why?

171
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.178
Maeve told me
it was punishment

172
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:07.472
for turning her back
on the old ways.

173
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.726
Well. she fell in love.
had a family...

174
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.814
and she forgot to respect
the Little People.

175
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:19.150
Poor woman.
losing her baby like that.

176
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.195
Seriously. I had no idea.
Mum... Mum never said a thing.

177
00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:25.615
Maeve truly believed that what
she was doing was important.

178
00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.242
And if it's all right
with you.

179
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.244
I'd like to continue
the tradition.

180
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.620
An offering. Every day.

181
00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:33.039
You mean you would be coming
into our garden every day?

182
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.541
I'm not sure we're...

183
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.626
No. um. I can do it.

184
00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.254
Every day?

185
00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.256
We've been gifted
this beautiful house.

186
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:45.051
and if doing this is
the only price we have to pay.

187
00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.636
then we're very.
very happy to do it.

188
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.597
-It's no problem. No.
-I promise.

189
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.559
Bless you both.

190
00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.607
Come to Fennessy's tonight.

191
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.817
-First drink is on the house.
-Thanks. Niamh.

192
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.652
-We will. Thank you.
-We will.

193
00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.154
It's very sweet. Bye-bye.

194
00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.781
Did you pack any raw liver?

195
00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.744
You know. that's the one thing
I forgot to pack. Damn it.

196
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.121
Shit. Shit!

197
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.539
I had a list and everything.

198
00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:16.750
-It was. uh. milk. tea bags...
-Blood.

199
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.002
Bloody raw liver
for the... what is it.

200
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.296
Redcap-offering-ritual thing?

201
00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.089
What was I thinking?

202
00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.384
This is our house.

203
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.179
We live here.

204
00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.930
Can you believe it?

205
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.853
Hmm?

206
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.898
I never thought
that we'd get out.

207
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.108
Hey. hey. hey. hey...

208
00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.486
That's in the past.

209
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.154
All right? I am never going

210
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.822
to let that happen
to you again.

211
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.575
We're safe here.

212
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.244
I promise. Okay?

213
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:57.165
Just you.
me and the little one.

214
00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.044
-Mm.
-Mm-hmm.

215
00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:06.549
Echoes of the pain

216
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:11.471
That you have hung upon the staves

217
00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.475
-Let it flow
-Let it flow

218
00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:20.105
-Let it flow
-Let it flow

219
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.357
I hear the wind

220
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.779
Rattling my window pane

221
00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:31.908
-Let it blow
-Let it blow

222
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.328
-Let it blow
-Let it blow

223
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:39.416
Parallel lines

224
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.960
Parallel lines

225
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:46.673
Running through time

226
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:56.057
Parallel lines

227
00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:03.064
They will never entwine

228
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:14.909
Birds gunshot scatter from your eyes...

229
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.829
-Hey! Hey. shoo!

230
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.497
Shoo! Go on.

231
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:20.915
-Shoo!

232
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.227
Look what I found.

233
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.395
Oh. yeah.

234
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.690
This used to be
on the mantelpiece.

235
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.443
Yeah.
Maeve would cross herself

236
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.737
every time she looked at it.

237
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.572
Do you think that's her child?

238
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.369
Oh. yeah. That.

239
00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.916
Yeah. I'll fix it tomorrow.
babe.

240
00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:10.256
Going. Yeah.

241
00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.885
-I need an Irish SIM.

242
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.007
Hi.

243
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.094
My husband emailed you
about getting some work done.

244
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:01.224
Ah. okay. It could have gone
into your junk mail maybe.

245
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.853
Niamh recommended you.
Does that help?

246
00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:07.021
Yeah. it's our roof.

247
00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:09.691
Yeah.

248
00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:12.485
Um...

249
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.446
I mean.
as soon as possible. really.

250
00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:19.742
Yeah.

251
00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.873
Since when did you eat Marmite?

252
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.041
Cravings. babe. Cravings.

253
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:32.380
I mean...
could they start this week?

254
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.677
She's actually laughing.

255
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.679
Your Aunt Maeve
was some character.

256
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:40.972
I can tell you.

257
00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.807
Healing hands. she had.

258
00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.019
Oh. she helped me with a touch
of the gout back in the day.

259
00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.605
and for that. well. Jesus...

260
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.148
No. no. put that away.
Put that away.

261
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.150
-Really?
-No. it's on the house.

262
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.985
-It's my treat.
-Oh...

263
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:58.031
-Mm. Mm...

264
00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.991
Oh. man. this is so good.

265
00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.245
-Everyone is so nice here.
-Yeah. they are.

266
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.456
Hey. whoa! Check it out. Look.

267
00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.880
General builders. Brilliant.

268
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.132
This wasn't on Niamh's list.
though. babe.

269
00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.508
Darling. this is Ireland.

270
00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.011
It rains
365 days of the year

271
00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:22.096
every year.
not just leap years.

272
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.724
The weather hasn't been
that bad. has it?

273
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.435
Not yet. It's sunny now.
but trust me.

274
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.491
Roofing and kitchens. Result!

275
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.284
-Hello?
-Babe. we should at least...

276
00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.495
-Fuck me!

277
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.163
Jesus Christ!

278
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.583
-Thanks for that!

279
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.543
-It's all right. It's okay.
-Fuck!

280
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.422
{\an8}

281
00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:11.813
-Shh. shh.

282
00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.272
Hi.

283
00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:34.002
-Sláinte!
-Sláinte!

284
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.587
-Oh! Ah.

285
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.716
-There you are. son.
-Oh!

286
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:40.925
You'll taste the difference
straight away.

287
00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:43.052
It's not like that muck
they give you over in London.

288
00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.013
-Good luck to you both now.
-Thank you.

289
00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.015
Baby clothes. Like this.
A whole sack.

290
00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:48.224
I won't take no for an answer.

291
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.559
That's actually... Thank you!

292
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.227
-They're so nice. Thank you.
-Great!

293
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.147
They're lovely. Aw!

294
00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:58.526
-Hi.
-Oh. bejaysus.

295
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:01.738
-Cheers.

296
00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.365
Sláinte.

297
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:07.618
-I'm Seamus.
-Nice to meet you. Seamus.

298
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:14.584
Maeve's house must be
a right auld shambles.

299
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.673
She never had much time
for your modern innovations.

300
00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:24.135
Jaysus. she didn't even
get the electricity

301
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.054
till after the millennium.

302
00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:28.264
Yeah. it's a fixer-upper.
Yeah. mate.

303
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.808
Big feckin' hole in the roof.

304
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:33.311
Oh. we've noticed.
That's our priority.

305
00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.855
But trying to find a builder
round here...

306
00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:37.356
that isn't booked up
is impossible.

307
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.901
Ah. They're all busy lads.
huh?

308
00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.277
No. Actually. we've been lucky.

309
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.780
We managed to find someone
to start straight away.

310
00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.364
What's his name. um...?

311
00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:47.075
-Col...?
-Colm Whelan.

312
00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:48.868
The Whelans!

313
00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:52.121
That shower of cowboys.

314
00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:54.499
Is there a problem?

315
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.668
Ah. don't take
any notice of them.

316
00:22:57.752 --> 00:23:00.088
The Whelans are fine.

317
00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:04.258
They might get a little
raucous at the weekends.

318
00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:06.052
but they'll do a good job.

319
00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:07.762
Daddy Whelan keeps them

320
00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:09.931
under control. sure enough.

321
00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:11.307
You'll be grand.

322
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:17.980
Just don't leave your missus
alone with the lads.

323
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:22.235
They'll be playing on her baps
like kids on a bouncy castle.

324
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:23.361
Wow!

325
00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:24.445
Rory. would you ever
shut your hole?

326
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.655
-It's... it's not cool. man.
-Wow. No.

327
00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:28.616
I don't mean nothing by it.

328
00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:30.618
I do think you're beautiful...

329
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:32.912
-Now. that's it now. Home.

330
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:35.206
Go home and sober up.
you old fool.

331
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.833
You're an old witch.

332
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.252
Away and wash
the back of your bollocks!

333
00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:43.506
Go home and you can
apologize when you're sober!

334
00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:45.007
Ah! Me bollocks!

335
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:47.093
And take your dog with you!

336
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:49.053
Fuck you! Come on! Ah! Ah!

337
00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:52.682
Go on! Youse can take your...

338
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:56.727
So... what did you
leave out tonight?

339
00:23:58.312 --> 00:24:01.357
-Sorry?
-For the Redcaps?

340
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.193
-Oh. shit. I'm so sorry.
-Did we do it?

341
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.278
I completely forgot.

342
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.113
Maya. you promised.
You said...

343
00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.906
I know. I'll do it
as soon as I get home.

344
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.158
Cross my heart.
pinkie promise.

345
00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:11.242
Uh. what was it?

346
00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:13.035
It was raw liver and...
Was that it?

347
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.662
-Yeah.
-Right.

348
00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:19.542
Can I have a... a word?

349
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.630
-Fucking hell.
-You're in trouble.

350
00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:27.383
-Really? This is really fun.
-Go on. Go and get told off.

351
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.759
What'll you have. Father?

352
00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:30.303
Guinness. please. a half.

353
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.096
-Let me do this.
-Do what now?

354
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.473
You won't even know I'm there.
First thing in the morning...

355
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:35.641
So you want to
wander in and out

356
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.101
of our garden. willy-nilly?

357
00:24:37.185 --> 00:24:39.729
It's our house.
it's our garden. No.

358
00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:41.022
I made a promise to Maeve.

359
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:42.565
And I get that. but I can't...

360
00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:45.193
-What harm will I do?
-No. Niamh!

361
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:53.201
Look. back in...

362
00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:55.203
back in London...

363
00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:02.251
we had three guys break into
our flat and try to kill us.

364
00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:06.297
What? I'm so sorry. I...

365
00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:09.592
I had no idea.

366
00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:11.510
That...
that must have been awful.

367
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:16.224
Yeah. it was. And I can't
be scared in my own house.

368
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:19.310
Not any more. Not again.
And not with this child.

369
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.983
When you said
you'd forgotten...

370
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:28.069
I broke a promise.
and I know that.

371
00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:32.073
It's important. Maya.
You have to do this.

372
00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.786
God. you really do believe.
don't you?

373
00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:43.292
I saw one once.

374
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:46.629
In the wood
at the bottom of your garden.

375
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:49.090
sure as I'm standing here.
Plain as day.

376
00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:53.469
But what happened
to not perpetuating

377
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.972
stereotypes of leprechauns
and all that?

378
00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:58.391
The Far Darrig...

379
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:02.311
are not jolly little elves.
Maya.

380
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:06.482
They'll be hungry.

381
00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:09.610
And they'll need feeding.
every day.

382
00:26:14.615 --> 00:26:15.908
Okay.

383
00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:19.203
Okay. Every day.

384
00:26:20.413 --> 00:26:22.039
Promise.

385
00:26:26.127 --> 00:26:27.586
Thank you.

386
00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:32.091
-Molly!

387
00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:34.010
Molly. come back here now!

388
00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:37.847
You silly dog. ya! Ahh!

389
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:43.686
'Twas a box of the finest old oak. sir

390
00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:48.941
'Twas a foot long and four inches wide

391
00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:53.571
Says I to myself. "Fuck the fairies." ha!

392
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:59.118
And I took a quick look inside

393
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:04.040
Now I opened the lid of this box. sir

394
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:09.170
And I swear that my story is true

395
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:14.342
'Twas an ancient old Irish French letter

396
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:18.429
A relic of Brian Boru...

397
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.847
Come on! Come on. Molly!

398
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:23.017
Go on up the yard now.

399
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:30.608
'Twas an ancient
old Irish French letter

400
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:35.571
'Twas a foot long and made of elk hide

401
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.573
Molly!

402
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:41.243
-Molly! Come back here now!

403
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:42.536
Who's there?

404
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:47.875
Away home now.
Stop wasting my time.

405
00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:51.420
You feckin' Jackeens!
I'll kick your arse for youse!

406
00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:56.008
It's past your bedtime. little one.

407
00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:01.597
-What are you now?

408
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.265
-Boo!

409
00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:20.908
Wake up! Babe. wake up!

410
00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:32.128
Shh. quiet. You'll wake them up.

411
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:35.256
Oh. for fuck's sake!

412
00:28:37.842 --> 00:28:39.051
Move your arses.

413
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:41.887
I want this kitchen done
before I die of old age.

414
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:44.014
Yeah. well.
if he's not movin' them.

415
00:28:44.098 --> 00:28:45.641
what am I supposed to do?

416
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.018
Careful. you big gobshite!

417
00:28:50.938 --> 00:28:52.022
Hello?

418
00:28:53.357 --> 00:28:55.609
Oh. Jamie. Maya.

419
00:28:55.693 --> 00:28:57.486
Lovely to see you again.

420
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.697
Mr Whelan.
we weren't expecting you.

421
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.073
Daddy Whelan.

422
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:02.992
Everyone calls me Daddy.
Hmm?

423
00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:06.745
Job fell through.
so we. uh. thought

424
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:08.247
no time like the present. huh?

425
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.875
Look. you don't mind us at all.

426
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:13.085
You just carry on with your
day as if we weren't here.

427
00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:14.545
Okay. um. it's just
we would have preferred

428
00:29:14.628 --> 00:29:15.713
if you'd called ahead

429
00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:17.548
because you all scared
the shit out of us.

430
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:20.176
No. you. maybe.
I mean. I was fine.

431
00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:23.512
Actually... actually.
I wasn't. I was terrified.

432
00:29:24.638 --> 00:29:26.849
Would you like a cup of tea.
Mr Whelan?

433
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.059
Daddy. Call me Daddy.

434
00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:32.438
-Three sugars. plenty of milk.
-Sorry.

435
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:34.190
So. you're gonna be starting

436
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:36.775
on the kitchen first.
not the roof?

437
00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:38.986
I mean. we would actually
rather the roof was done...

438
00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:42.156
Well. the scaffold won't be
here till tomorrow. so. uh...

439
00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:44.408
we thought why not make
the use of our time

440
00:29:44.492 --> 00:29:46.118
and start on your kitchen?

441
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.787
Eoin. help your sister
with that. will you.

442
00:29:48.871 --> 00:29:50.206
before she drops it.

443
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.291
I'll dock it
from both your wages.

444
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:54.502
You brothers and sisters.
are you?

445
00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.879
Eoin's our brother
from another mother.

446
00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:59.006
She was a big auld
fuckin' lump. too.

447
00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:00.674
-Killian!

448
00:30:03.052 --> 00:30:04.887
So. you're starting

449
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.597
a family business yourself.
huh?

450
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.432
-Yes.
-When is it due?

451
00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:11.101
Thanks. darling.
Um. any day now.

452
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:13.270
-Really soon.
-Boy or a girl?

453
00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:15.981
Oh. well.
we want it to be a surprise.

454
00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:20.027
Killian.

455
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.447
Use the cutters. for Jaysus's
sake. not your teeth.

456
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:26.325
Um. is it three sugars. Mr. Whelan?

457
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:28.118
Yes. please. darlin'.

458
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:30.538
Call me Daddy!

459
00:30:31.622 --> 00:30:34.208
Killian. get back to work.

460
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:37.711
Did you see how the one
with the dodgy haircut

461
00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:38.837
was staring at you?

462
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:41.799
Well. I saw the sister
giving you a little smile.

463
00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:44.552
And the dad.
making you call him "Daddy".

464
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:46.053
If he does that again.
I'm gonna...

465
00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:47.721
Then you're gonna what?

466
00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:50.307
-Are you gonna start a fight?
-No.

467
00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:53.936
-But I can finish one.
-Ooh.

468
00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:57.606
With your big Irish cricket bat.

469
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.233
-Just...

470
00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:01.569
Just don't call him "Daddy".
okay? It's weird.

471
00:31:01.652 --> 00:31:03.654
All right. We're not in Camden
any more. Toto.

472
00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:04.738
If we piss him off.

473
00:31:04.822 --> 00:31:06.615
we've still got a hole
in the roof. remember?

474
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:13.974
There's been
a place of worship here

475
00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:15.768
since the time of the Druids.

476
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.979
Even Cromwell and his men
couldn't extinguish our faith.

477
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.900
Is this your first child?

478
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:28.864
Sort of.

479
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.449
Sort of?

480
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:37.623
When I was very young.
before I met Jamie...

481
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:40.959
I was with a guy.
I got pregnant.

482
00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:44.129
but he wasn't father material.

483
00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:45.881
I see.

484
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.717
It was a difficult decision.
but I don't regret it.

485
00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:54.515
Our lives would have been bad.
Really. really bad.

486
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.061
And... I want this so much.

487
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:02.147
It's a fighter.

488
00:33:03.107 --> 00:33:07.361
Maya. I can't approve
of your actions. but...

489
00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:10.280
I sincerely hope
that you find peace here.

490
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.242
Thank you.

491
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:17.538
Well. Jamie. here we are.
Here's your Auntie Maeve.

492
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:20.374
{\an8}Next to your uncle
and the little one. of course.

493
00:33:21.417 --> 00:33:23.961
Well. uh.
I got you some flowers...

494
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.796
to say thank you.

495
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:27.381
We really appreciate you

496
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.133
leaving us the house.

497
00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:31.093
More than you know.

498
00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:35.973
So are they just stacked up
like Lego under there or...

499
00:33:36.056 --> 00:33:37.641
-Jamie.
-I'm just curious.

500
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:39.017
No. they're side by side.

501
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:42.104
Of course.
the child is just a stone.

502
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:45.399
-She was cremated?
-No. The body was never found.

503
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:49.153
Uh. didn't she die
of pneumonia?

504
00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:06.420
Seriously.
I have never drunk so much tea

505
00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:08.297
in my entire life.

506
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.090
I've got so much caffeine
in my system.

507
00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:12.634
I'm gonna be pissing pure
Barry's for days. I am.

508
00:34:12.718 --> 00:34:15.262
That's Niamh.
Pull over. Pull over. babe.

509
00:34:15.345 --> 00:34:16.555
Oh. yeah.

510
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:20.517
If you see anything. stop.

511
00:34:20.601 --> 00:34:22.352
raise your hand and call out

512
00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:24.646
and one of the supervisors
will come to you.

513
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.357
Hey. Niamh. Hi.

514
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:29.818
Rory didn't go home
last night.

515
00:34:29.902 --> 00:34:31.862
No one's seen him
since he left the pub.

516
00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:33.655
Oh. He was pretty drunk.
wasn't he?

517
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.948
You don't think he's...

518
00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:38.285
Oh. no. It's... it's Molly
I'm worried about.

519
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:42.039
-His dog.
-Can we help?

520
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:44.416
No. the lads have it covered.

521
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.169
You go on
and have a cup of tea.

522
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:49.713
Oh. tea. yay. Can't wait.

523
00:34:49.797 --> 00:34:51.215
I'll see you in a second.

524
00:34:52.508 --> 00:34:55.636
Um. we went to go
and see Maeve's grave today.

525
00:34:56.637 --> 00:34:59.515
Father Brendan told me
something interesting.

526
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.520
The baby didn't die of
pneumonia. did she. Niamh?

527
00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:10.776
She made a bargain
with the Redcaps...

528
00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:14.321
to save her dying husband.

529
00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:19.326
But Maeve paid
a terrible price.

530
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:21.161
What price?

531
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:25.082
She said the Redcaps
took her baby.

532
00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:29.169
I mean...

533
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:34.007
could it have been...
a post-natal depression thing?

534
00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:37.719
Because... some women
do hurt their children...

535
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:40.305
Maeve loved that child
more than life itself!

536
00:35:40.389 --> 00:35:43.559
She wouldn't harm a hair
on her head! No!

537
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:47.688
No.

538
00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:53.026
After the baby disappeared.

539
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.822
she devoted her life
to leaving those offerings.

540
00:35:58.866 --> 00:36:01.743
Keeping the monsters
on the other side of the wall.

541
00:36:12.004 --> 00:36:13.380
So you're telling me

542
00:36:13.463 --> 00:36:14.506
that my lovely
Great Aunt Maeve.

543
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.134
who used to give me chocolate
bars. was a baby killer?

544
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.469
-Great.
-No. we can't judge.

545
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:22.055
-People do crazy things.
-Yeah. Crazy.

546
00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:24.224
I was nearly abducted
when I was a little toddler

547
00:36:24.308 --> 00:36:25.767
outside my nursery.
and then my mum...

548
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:28.687
Your mum punched the guy
unconscious. Yes. I know.

549
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.690
because she tells me that
every time I fucking see her.

550
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:34.067
All I'm saying is that women.
mothers.

551
00:36:34.151 --> 00:36:37.112
-are capable of crazy shit.
-Yeah.

552
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.449
-Ow!
-Don't fuck with Mumma Bear.

553
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:42.826
Yeah. Shit.

554
00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.746
-Aw. Did I hurt you?
-Fucking guns. you have.

555
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:48.290
-No. Doesn't hurt.
-Did I hurt Pappa Bear?

556
00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:49.583
Doesn't hurt.
Pappa Bear is fine.

557
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:52.336
-Oh. is Pappa Bear bruised?
-Pappa Bear's fine.

558
00:37:01.637 --> 00:37:02.763
Oh. for fuck's sake.

559
00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:03.847
Take a breath. babe.

560
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:05.015
I'm really not in the mood
for a fight.

561
00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:07.976
Is that fucking weed?

562
00:37:11.939 --> 00:37:13.941
-Having a break?

563
00:37:14.024 --> 00:37:15.108
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

564
00:37:15.192 --> 00:37:17.319
You know. I would prefer it
if you didn't actually smoke

565
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.279
your doobies on my doorstep.

566
00:37:19.363 --> 00:37:21.323
-I need a bath.
-Okay.

567
00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:25.953
-Where's your dad?
-He's seeing a customer.

568
00:37:26.036 --> 00:37:27.329
Can I get in my own house.
please?

569
00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:28.622
-Your house?
-Yeah.

570
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:29.706
You own it. do you?

571
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.916
All the way
to the core of the Earth?

572
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:32.125
Well. the freehold. yeah.

573
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:37.339
Ash. how many times

574
00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:38.423
have the English
come to this country

575
00:37:38.507 --> 00:37:41.093
and told us
what's ours is now theirs?

576
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.177
Too many. Killy.

577
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.262
Thing is. though.
don't we always take it back?

578
00:37:44.346 --> 00:37:46.390
Always. Henry VIII.
the Desmond Rebellions.

579
00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:47.933
the Nine Years' War.
You heard of them?

580
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:49.226
Oliver Cromwell.

581
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.728
Ah. fuck it. yeah. How could
I forget that arsehole?

582
00:37:51.812 --> 00:37:53.063
-Yeah.
-The famine.

583
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:56.441
-Nah. two famines.
-Two fuckin' famines. yeah.

584
00:37:56.525 --> 00:37:58.068
Seems to me
that when the English

585
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:01.363
like the look of something.
they either buy it cheap.

586
00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.824
or send an army in
to steal it.

587
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.159
Would you like some ketchup

588
00:38:06.243 --> 00:38:08.578
with that massive chip
on your shoulder?

589
00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:11.790
I like your place. boss man.
It's nice.

590
00:38:11.873 --> 00:38:13.291
Maybe I should steal it.

591
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:15.377
No court in the land
would convict you. brother.

592
00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.461
Yes. yes. they would.

593
00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:18.171
And don't give me this
"Irish Rover" crap.

594
00:38:18.255 --> 00:38:21.883
I'm not Oliver Cromwell.
I'm actually Irish.

595
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.927
-You? Irish?

596
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:25.178
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

597
00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:27.305
Yeah. on his ma's side.

598
00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:31.059
Da told me. His Auntie Maeve
used to own this place.

599
00:38:31.143 --> 00:38:32.352
Ah. yeah. yeah.

600
00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:33.562
That mad auld bitch

601
00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:34.813
-that killed her kid. is it?

602
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:39.192
That's her. So that makes you
what. ugh... quarter Irish?

603
00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:40.819
Quarter Irish?

604
00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:42.404
Jaysus. it's like being
in the presence

605
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:44.573
of Michael Collins himself.

606
00:38:57.753 --> 00:39:00.547
Oh. Jesus Christ!

607
00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:27.949
Please. she's pregnant!

608
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:41.171
Jamie!

609
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:43.840
Maya?

610
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.136
-Maya!
-Maya! Maya!

611
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.596
-Maya!
-Darling Maya.

612
00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:53.975
Ah. you know. Eoin's... simple.

613
00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:56.394
But he doesn't mean any harm.

614
00:39:56.478 --> 00:39:59.189
Yeah. I know. I was just
very scared. that's all.

615
00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:01.108
And what about the other two?
They seem to be...

616
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:02.901
I'll have a word with them
tonight.

617
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:06.363
But. you know. their mother
passed away not so long ago.

618
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:08.657
-Oh. blimey. that's awful.
-Really sorry to hear that.

619
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.742
She could keep them
on the straight and narrow.

620
00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:13.829
She just had to say a word.

621
00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:18.500
Me? Well. I prefer the more
direct approach.

622
00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:19.584
Yeah. all right. okay.

623
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:22.212
I don't want you
hitting your kids and...

624
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.092
Ah. Well.
they need to know their place.

625
00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.510
We all need to know our place.

626
00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:30.053
This is gonna sound
a little petty.

627
00:40:30.137 --> 00:40:32.305
but they actually ate
all my chocolate Hobnobs.

628
00:40:32.389 --> 00:40:33.390
I don't mind...

629
00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:34.683
I don't mind if they ask.
but...

630
00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:36.601
Well. far be it from me
to get between a man

631
00:40:36.685 --> 00:40:39.813
and his choccy biscuits.
Oh. Jesus!

632
00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:42.566
Oh. well. like I said.
I'll... I'll have a word.

633
00:40:42.649 --> 00:40:44.067
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

634
00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:46.319
Well. see you
bright and early.

635
00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:48.822
-See ya.
-Thank you. Mr. Whelan.

636
00:40:50.407 --> 00:40:51.491
Daddy!

637
00:40:53.118 --> 00:40:55.036
Why the fuck
does he keep on asking me

638
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.288
to fucking call him "Daddy"?

639
00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:58.290
Just a fucking lunatic.

640
00:40:58.373 --> 00:41:00.458
No. it wasn't
just the Hobnobs.

641
00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:01.960
They ate
my fucking grapes. too.

642
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:04.504
Yeah. and one of them
left something in the loo.

643
00:41:04.588 --> 00:41:05.672
What?

644
00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:08.884
You are fucking kidding me!

645
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:12.179
Fuck's sake!

646
00:41:13.305 --> 00:41:14.806
Hey...

647
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.435
Why don't you go and take that
out on the punch bag. babe?

648
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:20.562
They're fucking useless.

649
00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:22.022
Useless bunch of...

650
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.606
Fucking hell.

651
00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:14.801
-Eoin!
-Eoin!

652
00:43:14.884 --> 00:43:17.012
Eoin!

653
00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:19.389
-Eoin. you're bleedin' thick.
-What the fuck?

654
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:21.057
Somebody
could have been killed!

655
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:22.976
-What are...? No. wait. wait.

656
00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:24.060
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

657
00:43:24.144 --> 00:43:25.353
Stop fucking laughing!

658
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.272
-Fuckin' chill out. man.
-No. no. This...

659
00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:28.356
This is your problem.

660
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.066
You don't take anything
fucking seriously!

661
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.735
Hey. hey. Calm down.
calm down. Shh. Calm down.

662
00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.069
It was a fuckin' mistake. man.

663
00:43:33.153 --> 00:43:34.237
It was just an accident.
right?

664
00:43:34.321 --> 00:43:36.531
No. no. no...
No. babe. they have to go.

665
00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:38.742
You have to go right now!

666
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.910
No. I can't fucking take this
any more!

667
00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:43.079
Calm down. please. Listen.
it was an accident. wasn't it?

668
00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:46.374
That's what I've been saying.
But he keeps getting angry.

669
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:47.584
Are you frustrated. Jamie?

670
00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:51.296
Do you know what? You are
unprofessional. You are lazy.

671
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.423
And... and you are thieves!

672
00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:54.507
Baby. please.

673
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:56.676
-Thieves. is it?
-Hey. hey. hey. hey!

674
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.803
-Stop it! Stop it!
-You come into my house.

675
00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:02.932
You break my things.
you take my stuff. you...

676
00:44:03.016 --> 00:44:04.184
-Stop!

677
00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:05.852
-Back off.
-Fuckin' big man!

678
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:08.313
Whoa-ho!
Fuckin' David Beckham.

679
00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:10.273
Please stop.
Will you just shut

680
00:44:10.357 --> 00:44:11.858
the fuck up right now.
please?

681
00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:14.486
Oh. darling. it's all right.
It's okay.

682
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:15.737
I'm all right.

683
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.989
You're all right.
We're all okay.

684
00:44:18.073 --> 00:44:20.700
Aren't we. yeah?
We're gonna fix it.

685
00:44:20.784 --> 00:44:23.495
It was just an accident. okay?
It was just an...

686
00:44:23.578 --> 00:44:25.538
-Hey. stop!

687
00:44:25.622 --> 00:44:26.998
-What the fuck are you doing?

688
00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:28.208
Hey. hey! Stop it!

689
00:44:28.291 --> 00:44:30.418
Stop fucking... Stop it!

690
00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:32.128
Daddy! Daddy. not in my home.

691
00:44:32.212 --> 00:44:34.255
Your home. My child.

692
00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:35.465
And I'll punish him
however I...

693
00:44:35.548 --> 00:44:38.134
-Stop! Stop it!

694
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:39.677
Daddy. stop.

695
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.097
Step away.

696
00:44:57.404 --> 00:44:59.531
-Who's the daddy now?
-I'm not talking to you.

697
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:02.158
-What did I do?

698
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:35.358
-Rory?

699
00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:07.765
Wow.

700
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.493
Hello?

701
00:46:59.442 --> 00:47:00.735
Hello?

702
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:13.748
Is anyone there?

703
00:47:21.798 --> 00:47:23.383
Oh. God.

704
00:47:24.634 --> 00:47:26.427
-Oh. hello.

705
00:47:28.221 --> 00:47:30.807
You're Rory's dog. Molly.

706
00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:34.269
Where is he. then? Huh?

707
00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:38.690
Is he drunk in a ditch
somewhere. the dirty bastard?

708
00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:45.905
All right.

709
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:48.616
You want me to follow you?

710
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:50.994
I'm coming.

711
00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:58.751
-Ah. you fuckin' eejit!

712
00:47:58.835 --> 00:48:01.004
Ey? Do you think
I was done with ya?

713
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:03.006
-You fuckin' halfwit!

714
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:06.509
Now get out of me sight!

715
00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:10.763
And if you're not back here
before we're done.

716
00:48:10.847 --> 00:48:12.640
you can fucking walk home!

717
00:48:21.024 --> 00:48:22.442
Molly. come on.

718
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:24.736
Oh. shit.

719
00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.531
Molly. come on.
let's go home now.

720
00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:37.790
Molly. I can't whistle and I'm
carrying an eight-pound baby.

721
00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:42.378
Molly?

722
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.549
Molly. there you are.
you silly mutt.

723
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:06.611
Molly. what have you found?

724
00:49:06.694 --> 00:49:07.945
Huh?

725
00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:34.639
Rory?

726
00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:40.853
Rory. are you there?

727
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:50.947
Molly?

728
00:49:54.283 --> 00:49:55.702
Hello.

729
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:59.205
Oh. has something died
in here?

730
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.627
What the fuck is this place?

731
00:50:04.711 --> 00:50:06.212
-Molly.

732
00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:08.339
-Molly. come on.

733
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.341
Oh. you want me
to come down there with you?

734
00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:12.885
No fucking way.
Molly. come on.

735
00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:15.346
-Come on. Fine.

736
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.641
You can stay here.
but I'm not coming down there.

737
00:50:18.725 --> 00:50:21.144
I'm going. I'm going.

738
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.482
Yeah. Good idea. Wait for me.

739
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:34.490
Molly?

740
00:50:36.451 --> 00:50:37.952
Oh!

741
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.495
Oh. God. it's you.

742
00:50:39.579 --> 00:50:41.456
Have you seen a dog?

743
00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:42.707
It's Rory's dog.

744
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.375
It's the guy
that's gone missing.

745
00:50:44.459 --> 00:50:46.335
I don't know if you know...

746
00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:50.089
Hey. are you all right. Eoin?

747
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.887
My da hates me.

748
00:50:56.596 --> 00:50:59.015
Hey. listen. um...

749
00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:02.393
Hate's a strong word.
I mean. you're his son and...

750
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.733
Why would he do that?

751
00:51:11.444 --> 00:51:12.779
He says...

752
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:18.451
He says when I was born.
I killed my mammy. and...

753
00:51:18.534 --> 00:51:19.952
it...

754
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.872
it should've been me
and not her.

755
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.666
Jesus Christ.

756
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:28.544
Sorry.

757
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:30.838
They all hate me.

758
00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:32.715
I'm not like them.

759
00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:39.430
I'm not clever or funny
or cool. I...

760
00:51:39.514 --> 00:51:41.849
I'm just a big. useless
fuckin' spud.

761
00:51:41.933 --> 00:51:44.644
Shh. Come on. don't cry.
That's not true.

762
00:51:45.603 --> 00:51:47.396
What the fuck would you know?

763
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.984
I actually do know. okay?
This is what bullies do.

764
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:53.611
Okay? They make you...

765
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:56.072
They make you think
that you're worthless.

766
00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:58.950
and... and they abuse you.

767
00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:00.076
I've not been abused.

768
00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:02.578
Come on.
look at those bruises. Eoin.

769
00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:05.081
-You need to tell someone.
-You can't tell anyone.

770
00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:08.918
-You have to tell someone.
-No. you can't tell anyone.

771
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:10.336
Okay. okay.

772
00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:14.090
-I won't tell anyone.

773
00:52:14.173 --> 00:52:15.925
I'm gonna help you.

774
00:52:16.759 --> 00:52:18.761
But you've gotta be strong.

775
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:20.680
-I am strong.
-No. I mean...

776
00:52:20.763 --> 00:52:22.473
I mean. up here.

777
00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:32.316
My da says the English
are all selfish. greedy cunts.

778
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.319
but... you're sound.

779
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.489
Oh. did he now?

780
00:52:38.573 --> 00:52:39.615
Thank you.

781
00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:42.910
No one's ever been this kind
to me before.

782
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:48.165
Okay. Well. you can let go
of my hand now. okay?

783
00:52:51.544 --> 00:52:52.879
I really like you.

784
00:52:52.962 --> 00:52:55.464
You're starting
to hurt me now.

785
00:52:55.548 --> 00:52:57.592
No. no... No. no. no. Eoin.

786
00:52:57.675 --> 00:52:58.843
Help!

787
00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:00.636
Eoin. Please...
Please don't hurt me.

788
00:53:41.177 --> 00:53:42.887
Oliver Cromwell.

789
00:53:44.347 --> 00:53:46.641
Fucking Hobnobs!

790
00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:48.809
-Prick!
-Jamie?

791
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:51.062
Jamie?

792
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:03.199
Daddy and the others.
are they here?

793
00:54:03.282 --> 00:54:06.285
No. it's...
it's just you and me.

794
00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:08.412
Why?

795
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:11.540
Maya?

796
00:54:12.708 --> 00:54:14.418
Hey. what's up. baby?

797
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:18.673
Is it our baby?

798
00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:20.591
I have something to show you.

799
00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:25.262
Okay.

800
00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:30.101
-Darling...
-Shh. shh.

801
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.979
Look...
shall we go back to the house?

802
00:54:33.062 --> 00:54:34.522
Shh.

803
00:54:35.398 --> 00:54:37.441
-What are you doing?
-Follow me.

804
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:39.485
-Maya. where are you...?

805
00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:41.362
It's here. It happened right here.

806
00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:42.738
Maya. Maya! Maya. come on.

807
00:54:42.822 --> 00:54:44.907
Eventually you're gonna have
to tell me what's going on.

808
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:46.575
Eoin tried to kill me.

809
00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:49.870
-He... he what?
-Yeah.

810
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.914
What... what did
he do to you? Where is he?

811
00:54:51.998 --> 00:54:53.332
I'll fucking kill him!

812
00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:54.667
No. no. no. he's already dead.
He's already dead.

813
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.712
I. um. kneed him in the balls
because he tried to attack me.

814
00:54:57.795 --> 00:55:00.089
And then...
and then he held me down here.

815
00:55:00.172 --> 00:55:01.298
-What?
-I couldn't breathe.

816
00:55:01.382 --> 00:55:03.384
I thought I was gonna die.
I thought. "This is it."

817
00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:04.802
And then they came out
of the woods.

818
00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:06.554
-They? Who is they?
-There was a light.

819
00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:08.931
-Who came out of the woods?
-And then I screamed for help

820
00:55:09.015 --> 00:55:10.307
-and they came.
-Who... who came?

821
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:12.518
The Far Darrig.
The Little People.

822
00:55:13.394 --> 00:55:15.521
-The Little People?
-Yeah. they had these knives

823
00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:16.856
and cloaks and. fuck me.

824
00:55:16.939 --> 00:55:18.941
when I say this out loud.
I know...

825
00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:21.235
Hey. hey. hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

826
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.653
It's okay. Just look at me.

827
00:55:22.737 --> 00:55:23.738
Look. is there any chance

828
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:26.949
this is. you know.
just... baby brain?

829
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:29.035
I didn't fucking imagine this.

830
00:55:29.118 --> 00:55:32.371
-But this is...
-No. no. He was dragged here.

831
00:55:32.455 --> 00:55:34.749
He was... he was dragged here
and then...

832
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.543
Ha! There! There!
Look at this! Explain that!

833
00:55:37.626 --> 00:55:38.711
Explain it.

834
00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:41.881
Wait... what am I looking at here?

835
00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:43.507
It's... it's blood. isn't it?

836
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:45.593
Maybe your brain blocked
what really happened.

837
00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:46.969
Oh. fuck's sake. Jamie.
Fuck's sake.

838
00:55:47.053 --> 00:55:48.387
Look. all I'm saying is that

839
00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:49.847
maybe he's done
a runner. okay?

840
00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:51.807
He attacked you.
you kicked him in the balls.

841
00:55:51.891 --> 00:55:55.561
or you... you cut him.
and... and he's done a runner.

842
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:57.354
No. that's...
that's not what happened.

843
00:55:57.438 --> 00:56:00.483
Maya. Maya. Try and see this
from my point of view. okay?

844
00:56:00.566 --> 00:56:02.526
Look. what is more likely?

845
00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:05.321
What is more likely?

846
00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:08.616
There's a hut.
Okay. there's a hut.

847
00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.534
Deeper into the woods.
and it was this way.

848
00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:12.620
And it's. um.
made out of stone.

849
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.371
-It looks like a beehive.
-All right.

850
00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:16.582
And I think there were fucking
human bones in there.

851
00:56:16.665 --> 00:56:18.250
-But Molly showed me.
-Who is Molly?

852
00:56:18.334 --> 00:56:19.627
You know. Rory's dog. Molly.

853
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.711
All right. no. come on.

854
00:56:20.795 --> 00:56:21.837
Let's...
let's go back to the house.

855
00:56:21.921 --> 00:56:23.464
You're clearly
under a lot of stress.

856
00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:25.591
-No. this isn't stress.
-Then what is it?

857
00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.343
What is it?

858
00:56:29.428 --> 00:56:30.888
You shout more.

859
00:56:32.056 --> 00:56:33.933
-What?
-You know. since that night.

860
00:56:34.016 --> 00:56:37.228
you shout more.
And you're punching things.

861
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:39.939
That's not the Jamie I know.
I married a nice guy.

862
00:56:40.022 --> 00:56:42.024
And look where that got me!

863
00:56:42.108 --> 00:56:45.319
Yeah. And I was beaten. too.
but you don't see me...

864
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:47.530
And I had to watch...
I had to watch!

865
00:56:47.613 --> 00:56:49.907
As they threatened you
and my baby

866
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:51.408
and I couldn't do a thing!

867
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:53.994
Do you know what that's like?

868
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.372
Do you know
what that's like for a man?

869
00:56:57.957 --> 00:56:59.834
Of course you fucking don't.

870
00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:02.670
And it is my solemn promise

871
00:57:02.753 --> 00:57:07.091
that I will never. ever allow
that to happen to you again.

872
00:57:09.218 --> 00:57:10.970
Where are you going?

873
00:57:11.053 --> 00:57:12.805
We're going home.

874
00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:14.640
And then I'm going to the pub.

875
00:57:38.247 --> 00:57:39.790

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:48.883
So just fuck off and die.

881
00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:50.676
Don't bother comin'...

00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.553
Seriously. look. Da says

883

Just call us back.

884
00:57:54.555 --> 00:57:57.099
-Prick.
-No sign of your brother. huh?

885
00:57:57.183 --> 00:57:59.101
Are you listening in
on my call?

886
00:57:59.185 --> 00:58:01.604
-Nosy bitch.
-First Rory. now Eoin.

887
00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:03.856

Time to get them involved.

With all due respect. Father.

-Oh. you have?
-Mm-hm.

893
00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:23.626
Where's Eoin?

894
00:58:23.709 --> 00:58:26.045
I... I don't know.

895
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:30.883
what are you doing?

896
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:32.009
You got something
in your teeth?

897
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.594
Oh. Ash knows
how to spot a liar.

898
00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:36.972
I'm... I'm not lying.

899
00:58:37.056 --> 00:58:39.016
Well. she's never wrong.
though. so...

900
00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:40.935
if you've anything to hide.
she'll find it.

901
00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:42.394
No. no. seriously.
I'm not lying.

902
00:58:42.478 --> 00:58:45.147
I haven't seen Eoin since...
this morning.

903
00:58:46.106 --> 00:58:48.651
You're such an uptight.
frustrated little man. Jamie.

904
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:50.110
aren't ya?
I mean. look at you.

905
00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:51.862
You're like a can of Coke.

906
00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:53.280
You're all shook up
but there's no one

907
00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:54.615
to crack the ring-pull.

908
00:58:56.408 --> 00:58:58.494
So does he know
where Eoin is or what?

909
00:59:00.287 --> 00:59:01.872
He knows something.

910
00:59:01.956 --> 00:59:04.124
Just tell us. Jamie.
Just release all that tension.

911
00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:05.751
Leave the lad alone.

912
00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:07.795
Will you mind your own
business. you tramp?

913
00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:11.423
This is our business.
He lives in our village.

914
00:59:11.507 --> 00:59:13.550
-For. like. five minutes.
-You're barred.

915
00:59:15.094 --> 00:59:16.303
I think you should leave now.

916
00:59:16.387 --> 00:59:18.097
Yeah. not till we
take care of this. all right?

917
00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.890
Oh. we all know
how you Whelans

918
00:59:19.974 --> 00:59:21.058

919
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:22.142
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

920
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:25.896
Well. if you know anything.

To us.

923
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.403
And not your wives
or your husbands.

924
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:34.780
and not to Niamh or the local
fuckin' gossip. all right?

925
00:59:34.863 --> 00:59:36.699
And don't go
to the fuckin' guards!

926
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.285
-You come to us. All right?
-Yeah.

927
00:59:39.368 --> 00:59:41.412
That's it now. Come on. Out!

928
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:43.038
Bye. Jamie.

930
00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:54.466
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

931
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.677
-I am so sorry.
-No. don't worry.

932
00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.138
Thank you for sticking up
for me. though.

933
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.141
-Will you have another pint?
-Love one.

934
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.435
-Good man.
-Thank you.

935
01:00:32.338 --> 01:00:35.174
Fuck.

936
01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:53.400
Help me!

937
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.076
Help!

938
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.405
Oh. fuck.

939
01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.549
Oh. fuck.

940
01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.981
Amumma wikka babby.

941
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:18.777
Amumma! Ah!

942
01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:25.117
Oh. come on! Fuck!

943
01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.204
-Oh...

944
01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.924
Fuck! Okay. Okay...

945
01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:49.141
Fuck!

946
01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:52.144
{\an8}

947
01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:55.772
{\an8}

948
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.078
Hi. darling.
Do you know that Krav Maga...?

949
01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:53.539
-What are you...?
-Shh. shh. shh.

950
01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:54.623
I was only gone
for a couple...

951
01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:55.791
I have something to show you.

952
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:57.918
You what?

953
01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.796
Jesus. this is the last time
I go to the fucking pub.

954
01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:02.548
Ow. babe. ow!
You're hurting me.

955
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:05.384
-Look in the bag.
-Why?

956
01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.136
What are you fucking on about?

957
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.221
Do you believe me now?

958
01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:10.597
Oh. fuck me. that's a head!

959
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.226
-That is a fucking head.
-I know. I know.

960
01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.606
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

961
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.942
I... I didn't do anything.
That... that wasn't me.

962
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.318
Okay. I saw one.

963
01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:24.987
It came through
the French windows

964
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.781
and it casually just
dropped it off like it was...

965
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.367
a fucking pizza delivery boy.

966
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.203
Ah. a-ha. I got photos.
I took loads of...

967
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:36.039
I took loads of photos.
Took loads of photos. Um...

968
01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.417
Shit. they came out
really weird.

969
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.003
I think it's their idea
of a gift.

970
01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.672
-Whose... whose idea?
-The Little People.

971
01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.257
The Redcaps. The Far Darrig.

972
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.634
They're real.
Baby. they're real.

973
01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:51.638
And they killed Eoin. And we
need to take it to the police.

974
01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:52.723
And tell them what?

975
01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:53.807
That he was decapitated

976
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.809
by a bunch
of fucking leprechauns?

977
01:04:58.562 --> 01:04:59.813
Oh. God.

978
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.231
-Oh. fuck. oh. fuck...
-Oh...

979
01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:02.566
Hide that. stay out of sight.

980
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:03.900
-I'm gonna get rid of them.

981
01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:20.375
Uh... Who is it?

982
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:22.127
I want answers. Jamie!

983
01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:25.464
Look. sorry. it...
it's really late.

984
01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.341
We're actually
just going to bed.

985
01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.343
Where's my boy?

986
01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:30.844
Look. Daddy...

987
01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.389
Colm. I have... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

988
01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.058
He never left this place!

989
01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:38.352
I think you know
what happened!

990
01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.854
No.
we had nothing to do with it.

991
01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:42.981
Nothing to do with what?

992
01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:45.692
Nothing. nothing. We had
nothing to do with nothing.

993
01:05:45.776 --> 01:05:48.111
Oh. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes.
you do! You do!

994
01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.280
You do! You do! You do!

995
01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:54.117
You pricks know something!
Now open this fucking door!

996
01:05:54.201 --> 01:05:57.496
Whoa! Leave now or I...
I am calling the police!

997
01:05:57.579 --> 01:06:00.207
-I... I'm dialing.

998
01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.958
All right. calm yourself.

999
01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.252
We're... we're going now.

1000
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.549
Come on. kids!

1001
01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:22.062
Oh. fuck me.
Maya. where's your phone?

1002
01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.189
-Jesus!

1003
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.608
-Get out!

1004
01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:29.361
Go away.
You... you can't do this!

1005
01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.530
Jamie. me boy.

1006
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:36.743
when it comes to my family.
I do whatever I want.

1007
01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.097
-Jamie. listen.

1008
01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.142
If it was an accident.
I understand. Hm?

1009
01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:01.852
Eoin's a clumsy fucker

1010
01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:04.604
and I've been making excuses
for him for long enough.

1011
01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.065
If he touched your missus.

1012
01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:09.860
he has form there too.
and... and I'm sorry.

1013
01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.820
-But you have to let me know.

1014
01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:12.904
Okay...

1015
01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:14.781
And I'll be the one
to punish him.

1016
01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:23.540
Where is the good lady
Mrs. Jamie. huh?

1017
01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:27.085
She's uncharacteristically
quiet.

1018
01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:33.091
Aw. What have we got...

1019
01:07:35.594 --> 01:07:38.472
You're not
answering me. Jamie boy.

1020
01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.725
What? What?

1021
01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.352
You're probably
thinking of some other way

1022
01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:46.021
-to get help.
-Shit!

1023
01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:50.066
Let me reassure you.
this is not my first rodeo.

1024
01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:03.413
No. no. no... Fuck!

1025
01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.834
Last chance. Jamie.

1026
01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.759
What is it?

1027
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:16.927
They...

1028
01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:19.846
-What?
-They...

1029
01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:24.351
What? Jesus!

1030
01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:28.688
-Oh. fuck!

1031
01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:32.400
It's...

1032
01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:34.945
-It's Eoin.
-Eoin?

1033
01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.072
Eoin!

1034
01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:42.077
Eoin!

1035
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.496
Please. we need your help!

1036
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:46.122
I'll kill him!

1037
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:54.297
Oh. shit! Fuck!

1038
01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.350
Fuck this place up.

1039
01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:21.700
Killian!

1040
01:09:22.784 --> 01:09:24.786
Where are you?
Get the fuck down here!

1041
01:09:27.414 --> 01:09:28.790
Killy!

1042
01:09:32.043 --> 01:09:34.546
Oh! Fuck me!

1043
01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:57.777
Maya.

1044
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.299
-Fuck!

1045
01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.720
Come on. fucker. Try me!

1046
01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.223
Go on. Go on.

1047
01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.850
Get out! Get out!

1048
01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:30.769

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.210
-Now. where is he?
-I don't know.

1095
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:02.504

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.827
Try me.

1106
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.870
It was the Far Darrig.

1107
01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:37.956
The Redcaps.

1108
01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:40.708
You know. the Little People.
They're real.

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:43.378
Killian. stop it!
Jesus Christ.

1110
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.883
You know.
I came up here to kill you.

1111
01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:54.514
But if you tell me
where the person is

1112
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.809

to my son.

1113
01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.979
maybe. maybe...
I won't have to.

1114
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.441
So are you gonna tell me

1115
01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:08.820

1116
01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.224

You bitch!

1124
01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.763
-Look at me.
-Shh.

1125
01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.973
Kill that useless
streak of piss. Killian.

1126
01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.892
-Really?
-No.

1127

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:42.455
You'll regret this.
You will. You will.

1135
01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.499
Oh. no. this is it.
This is it.

It's wearing clothes.

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:22.662
Or is it some sort of monkey?

1142
01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.956
It's wearing clothes!

1143
01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.292
Well. monkeys wear clothes

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.345
-Redcaps?

1226
01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.640
Fuck me!

1227
01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.395
My mother used to
tell me stories.

1228
01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:04.939
People would...

1229
01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:08.984
ask for favours.
for gold. for love...

1230
01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:15.950
But there was always
a price to pay.

1231
01:23:19.245 --> 01:23:24.250
See... they were
the last of me slugs.

1232
01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.876
Heavy duty ones. you know.

1233
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.878
that would blow
your fuckin' brains out!

1234
01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:31.716
-These are just... birdshot.

1235
01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:33.676
I'll have to get
right up close

1236
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:34.760
to finish him off.

1237
01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:36.929
Please. please.
please. please. don't kill us.

1238
01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.639
Kill you? No.

1239
01:23:38.723 --> 01:23:40.599
No. From here...

1240
01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:44.729
this will hurt you real bad.
but you'll live.

1241
01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:47.732
Your baby. though...

1242
01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:52.528
You kill my kids.
I'll kill yours!

1243
01:23:58.284 --> 01:23:59.702
-You mutt!

1244
01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:13.466
How close do I need to get?

1245
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.728
Are you okay?

1246
01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:30.775
Of course not. I'm having...
I'm having our baby.

1247
01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:34.528
-Okay. Okay.

1248
01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:54.590
Feast.

1249
01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.884
-Just keep breathing. darling.

1250
01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:59.261
Just keep breathing.
It's gonna be okay.

1251
01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:03.265
-Ah! Oh. careful of the glass.

1252
01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:04.767

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:11.357
-Okay. Okay.

1256
01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.822
-Just breathe. darling.
-I'm scared.

1257
01:25:17.905 --> 01:25:18.906
Just breathe. Don't be scared.

1258
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.284
I'm here. Don't be scared.

1259
01:25:22.368 --> 01:25:24.078
-Don't be scared. I'm here.

1260
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:27.414
You're doing great.
There. that's it. Go on. push.

-Okay.

1263
01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.129
-Right. that's it.

1264
01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:35.673
Okay. darling.

1265
01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:38.717

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:52.731
-Here it comes. Here it comes.

1269
01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:59.363
-It's a baby girl.

1272
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:11.166

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.669

1274
01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.840

-Got any painkillers?
-Ah. sure. Of course.

Got his blood
all over this house.

1283
01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.813
What are we gonna
tell people. eh?

1284
01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:59.024
Shh. Whatever we tell them.

1285

own stories. aren't they?

But right this second.
I don't give a shit.

Noise cancellation. high.

1290
01:28:54.288 --> 01:28:56.582
Trauma and -

1291
01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:59.835
Accessing Healing Power
Through Mindfulness.

1292
01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:02.171
by Dr. Mark Oliver.

1293
01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:05.257
To heal from trauma

1294
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:09.136
is to change the perception
of the traumatic episode

1295
01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.847
from helplessness to control.

1296
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:16.393
By following my six simple
methods of disassociation...

1297
01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:58.435
No! No!

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.281
