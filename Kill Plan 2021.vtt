they're all over the place.

18
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.070
- We have to get back to Nash.

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.736
- Good idea.
Come on.

32
00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:43.820
- You're hit.

33
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.236
- Shit my leg.

34
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:46.359
- We're close to the ridge.

35
00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.010
Will be the fourth point
in about four seconds.

36
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.028
(gunshots fire)
- [Winston] Just leave me.

37
00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.423

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:52.256
(gunshots fire)

39
00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:53.303
You're gonna have to leave me behind.

40
00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:54.940
- Bullshit. I'm not leaving anybody.

41
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.508
- I can take out all these scumbags.

42
00:01:56.508 --> 00:01:58.167
- I'm not saying you can't.

43
00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.490
(gunshots fire)

44
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.916

(gunshots fire)

46
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.250
- Hubbard's gone after them too.

47
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.330
- I'm gonna be a burden.

48
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.327
Just leave me.

49
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.228
- One team. all in. all out.

50
00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.450
Winston. stay with him.

51
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.180
- Is Hubbard at the meeting point?

52
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.306
Are we gonna live?

53
00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:15.884
- Of course we're gonna live.

54
00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:17.660
The good guys always win.

Watch him I'm going in.

58
00:02:20.927 --> 00:02:21.996
- [Mara] I've got this.

59
00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:24.015
We're gonna make it.

60
00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:27.500
(ominous music)

61
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.018
- Hubbard.

62
00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:29.851
Hubbard.

63
00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:32.675
Hubbard.

64
00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:35.436
Hubbard. it's me.

65
00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.252
- [Hubbard] Nash.

66
00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.341
- [Nash] Hubbard.

67
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.174
Come out.

68
00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:44.620
- Winston?
- He got hit.

69
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.761
They're gonna meet us back at the Humvee.

70
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:47.908
- This will bring down
the entire organization.

71
00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:48.741
- Wait. I thought they were gonna-

72
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.543
- I need to disappear.
- [Nash] What?

73
00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:51.958
- This is worse than anyone knows.

74
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.340
- Wait what about the docs?

75
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.409
- There are no docs. Nash.

76
00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:55.242
- No docs?

77
00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:56.335
- [Hubbard] It was a little lie.

78
00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:59.115
XZ-9. is the deadliest drug

79
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:00.829
the world has ever known.

80
00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:01.706
- That'll be our secret.

81
00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:02.539
- [Hubbard] Yeah.

82
00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:03.472
- Take to your grave.

83
00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:05.236
- Yeah just don't tell Mara.

84
00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:06.132
- I won't.

85
00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:07.687
- It's the Chinese.

86
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.882
Xieng.

87
00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:09.965
The Wan clan.

88
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.437
I think there's trouble on the inside.

89
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:13.270
- Wan clan?

90
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.103
What do you mean?

91
00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:16.418
- State side there's a. there's a lab.

92
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:18.135
The one I told you about.

93
00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:19.679
He'll do whatever it takes.

94
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.572
- That means this was an inside job.

95
00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:23.405
- We're not safe here.

96
00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.540
They could be listening right now.

97
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.759
- Will I see you again?

98
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.650
- [Hubbard] Watch your back Nash.

99
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.820
I gotta plan for you.

100
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.153
It's not pretty.

101
00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:39.060
- Be safe partner.

102
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.114
(gunshots fire)

103
00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:43.402

(man exclaims)

110
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.158
- [Mara] Nash.

111
00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:21.228
- Yeah.

112
00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.993
(keyboard clicks)

113
00:04:22.993 --> 00:04:24.761
- Mara hey. what's going on?

114
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:25.594
- It's almost showtime.

115
00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:27.192
- Yeah.
- Coffee.

116
00:04:27.192 --> 00:04:28.230
- I agree in my mind.

117
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.313
- Oh parapsychology is my specialty.

118
00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:31.333
(Nash chuckles)

119
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:32.822
- I think caffeine is the only

120
00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:35.132
psychology I need at the moment.

121
00:04:35.132 --> 00:04:38.062
So tell me. what are
the theatrics of today?

122
00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:40.153
- Could you open your computer?

123
00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.518
Dr. Dina Sloan from last week briefing.

124
00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:44.729
she said to downplay the effects of XZ-9.

125
00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.798
We didn't think she'd go through with it

126
00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:48.596
but she announced the stream
last night on social media.

127
00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:50.766
- Is she still dealing with Ukraine?

128
00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:52.251
- Not exactly.

129
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.084
(paper rustle)

130
00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.876
Our sources say Hong Kong
but this entire operation is like

131
00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:58.278
an onion wrapped inside a
vortex of power players.

132
00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:00.227
- Yeah I was just thinking about Hubbard.

133
00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.564
(gunshot fires)
(ominous music)

134
00:05:03.564 --> 00:05:04.981
- You were close.

135
00:05:05.854 --> 00:05:09.476
- Yeah but now he is gone like the wind.

136
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.940
- Hey. you did all you could.

137
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.414
Your head is just playing games on you.

138
00:05:12.414 --> 00:05:13.942
- No my head is wrapped on tight

139
00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:15.977
and operating at full capacity. trust me.

140
00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:19.217
- Hey. energy weapons
have lingering effects.

141
00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:20.900
I'm here if you wanna talk.

142
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.879
- You know I appreciate that. I really do.

143
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.598
Maybe we'll grab drinks at
that bar I go to sometimes.

144
00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:28.942
- Only if I'd pick up the first round.

145
00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:29.788
- Ah. look at you.

146
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.621
(Nash claps)

147
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:33.734
You're trying to get an award
for like partner of the year.

148
00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:34.696
Partner of the decade.

149
00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:35.692
- Well. I aim to please.

150
00:05:35.692 --> 00:05:37.084
(both chuckle)

151
00:05:37.084 --> 00:05:38.174
Looks like she's getting ready.

152
00:05:38.174 --> 00:05:39.341
- [Nash] Okay.

153
00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:42.228
- [Dr. Dina] Good afternoon.

154
00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:43.929
I'm Dr. Dina Sloan.

155
00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:45.422
Head of the research panel

156
00:05:45.422 --> 00:05:49.033
and professor emeritus on
XZ-9 at Gillis University.

157
00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:51.529
I've provided a statement
today regarding ZX-9

158
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.561
and I'm gonna share
that all with you today.

159
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.268
- All right doc. enlighten me on

160
00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:57.684
how XZ-9 is no longer a threat.

161
00:05:57.684 --> 00:05:59.622
- Understand that there was a lot of talk

162
00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:01.956
about this drug being
used in certain government

163
00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:04.660
and foreign government funded experiments.

164
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.041
Due to the insistence by
news media and social media.

165
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.929
the infiltration that ZX-9
is a threat to humankind

166
00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:12.520
and that's simply not true.

167
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.110
These are all lies.

168
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.494
I have studied XZ-9 since its creation.

169
00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:19.644
XZ-9 has never been a hostile chemical

170
00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:23.081
especially when mixed
properly with other chemicals.

171
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:24.740
In fact. we've seen great effects

172
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.924
in the treatment of
many different diseases.

173
00:06:26.924 --> 00:06:29.233
On behalf of my colleagues
at the institute

174
00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:32.889
we will be closing all
research regarding XZ-9

175
00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.572
and production as well as
reporting all further findings

176
00:06:35.572 --> 00:06:37.324
through the government's
Ministry of Science

177
00:06:37.324 --> 00:06:39.638
and of course all the
research will be available

178
00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:41.996
to the public as it comes our way.

179
00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:46.345
You have nothing to fear
and the truth will come.

180
00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:47.726
Thank you.

181
00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:51.174
(audience clapping)

182
00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:52.007
- Well looks likes someone's trying

183
00:06:52.007 --> 00:06:53.802
to close the book on XZ-9.

184
00:06:53.802 --> 00:06:54.635
- Fear the pages of that book

185
00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:56.634
have already being torn to shreds.

186
00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:59.162
- So the old narrative still stands.

187
00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:00.810
- I sent you all of Hubbard's reports.

188
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.120
Read them over again and align to this

189
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.454
'cause something doesn't add up.

190
00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:06.171
- So what'd you know about Dr. Dina?

191
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.600
- You saw the speech.

192
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.586
Believable.

193
00:07:08.586 --> 00:07:09.620
- It's bullshit.

194
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.549
- How do you know?

195
00:07:10.549 --> 00:07:12.528
- Can I tell you what I know about XZ-9?

196
00:07:12.528 --> 00:07:13.504
About five years ago.

197
00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:15.408
the Chinese government and
a pharmaceutical company

198
00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:18.840
were working together on a super drug.

199
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.940
It actually worked and
these guys were stronger.

200
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.322
smarter. faster.

201
00:07:22.322 --> 00:07:25.285
They tested on Chinese soldiers.

202
00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:27.210
Well nine months these guys were dying.

203
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.045
I mean would drop like flies.

204
00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:30.821
When the government found
out the soldiers was dying.

205
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.389
started blaming the US Special Ops team.

206
00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:36.117
Hubbard and I were of that team.

207
00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:39.007
(Mara sighs)

208
00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:40.208
- Well our social media ops are already

209
00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:42.791
pushing the official narrative.

210
00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:46.510
- Winston?

211
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.417
- That's your next meeting?

212
00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:48.250
Mine too.

213
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.253
- Okay.

214
00:07:49.253 --> 00:07:51.279
I mean we've got a few
minutes I can meet you there.

215
00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.810
- We do.

216
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.951
(phone rings)

217
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:55.018
- You better get that.

218
00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:56.525
- Yeah.

219
00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:57.520
Right. I'll catch up soon.

220
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.353
- Yeah.

221
00:07:59.715 --> 00:08:02.373
(paper rustles)

222
00:08:02.373 --> 00:08:05.040
(ominous music)

223
00:08:09.673 --> 00:08:10.979
- [Dr. Dina] There's
never been an intention

224
00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.048
to use XZ-9
(Mr. Wan laughs)

225
00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:15.094
as a malicious agent or
as a chemical weapon.

226
00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:18.173
If we as free citizens
and the democratic society

227
00:08:18.173 --> 00:08:19.935
can spend more time looking at
- Yes.

228
00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:22.608
- the actual findings of this
situation rather than doing-

229
00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:23.874
(keyboard clicks)

230
00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:25.535
(ominous music continues)

231
00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:28.285
(Mr. Wan laughs)

232
00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.516
- You don't realize what
you did little girl.

233
00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:36.900
(Mr. Wan laughs hysterically)

234
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.567
(buttons click)

235
00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:42.207
I want you to find out

236
00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:45.356
where Dr. Sloan does her business.

237
00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:46.738
Her little PR stunt

238
00:08:46.738 --> 00:08:49.999
just pushed up one step
closer to our goal.

239
00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:51.903
(Mr. Wan laughs)

240
00:08:51.903 --> 00:08:54.403
(phone thuds)

241
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.796
You will soon find out
the wrath of Wan clan.

242
00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:02.027
(Mr. Wan laughs hysterically)

243
00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:04.694
(ominous music)

244
00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:10.240
(Mr. Wan chuckles)

245
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.573
I got the best in the world.

246
00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:14.806
Check it out.

247
00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:19.395
(ominous music)

248
00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:21.112
This nerve drug

249
00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:22.958
will change the world.

250
00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.791
Check it out.

251
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.919
- Let me see it.

252
00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:28.419
(ominous music continues)

253
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.066
- It's good?

254
00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:37.247
(man speaks in foreign language)

255
00:09:37.247 --> 00:09:38.628
- What you want to sell me?

256
00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:39.490
Soap?

257
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.323
- What?

258
00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:42.378
- Never fucking try it again.

259
00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:44.234
- That's the best.

260
00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.887
(Mr. Wan laughs)

261
00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:47.663
- You are crazy.

262
00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:51.135
Never try to screw me again. okay?

263
00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:52.863
- Nobody crossing me.

264
00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:57.863
(ominous music)
(gunshot fires)

265
00:10:05.261 --> 00:10:06.094
- Dexter.

266
00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:07.082
Winston

267
00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:08.801
and where's Mara?

268
00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:09.926
Oh.
(Nash chuckles)

269
00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:10.926
Hey.
- Sorry.

270
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:14.826
- Nash thought you were out sick.

271
00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:16.221
You look like a million bucks.

272
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.173
(Nash laughs)

273
00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:18.006
- Well thank you.

274
00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:19.215
I feel like shit but I'm here.

275
00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:20.991
- Oh. you just need a vacation.

276
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:21.989
Take some time off.

277
00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.719
- Nah. I'm not doing vacations.

278
00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:25.775
Especially when everything
smells like shit.

279
00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:26.763
There's a lot of shit on desk.

280
00:10:26.763 --> 00:10:29.219
I can't sleep. can't focus so.

281
00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:30.052
(Nash mumbles)

282
00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:31.170
- I just ran data on the conference.

283
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.982
It seems the general population is moving

284
00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:34.003
in the intended direction.

285
00:10:34.003 --> 00:10:35.669
- Good.
- And if they don't.

286
00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:36.693
we'll just keep what's in the air ways.

287
00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:37.860
They'll learn.

288
00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:40.545
- Yeah.

289
00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:42.834
Our Russian teams in the Chinese firms

290
00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:44.645
are working in our favor on this.

291
00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:46.770
In fact soon. the only people
that will be mentioning

292
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.637
about the XZ-9 operation is

293
00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:52.714
conspiracy nut jobs and
intellectual obscureness.

294
00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:53.909
(Nash laughs)

295
00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:55.349
- You've got a couple of big words.

296
00:10:55.349 --> 00:10:57.741
- I've been reading books. should try.

297
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.845
(Nash exclaims)

298
00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:01.032
- Detect a little bit of hostility.

299
00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:04.028
Was making a joke.
We are all in the same team here

300
00:11:04.028 --> 00:11:05.869
and we're all the same type okay?

301
00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:07.378
- Precisely. in fact.

302
00:11:07.378 --> 00:11:09.386
that's why we're gonna
start moving more rapidly

303
00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:11.858
on the XZ-9 operation.

304
00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:12.880
In fact. right before this meeting

305
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.149
I was told that there was talk

306
00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:16.770
of moving the shipment to Hawaii.

307
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.805
- The Pacific lab.

308
00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:20.397
No. no. we'll never get results.

309
00:11:20.397 --> 00:11:21.906
I've been trying to tell
him McCalsky for weeks.

310
00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:23.425
- No there's more to it though.

311
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:27.402
We were going to recruit
this Dr. Dina's partner.

312
00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:28.865
The Chinese are funding him.

313
00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.712
It's this Dr. Xieng.

314
00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:31.618
- [Nash] Okay.

315
00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:32.576
Okay.

316
00:11:32.576 --> 00:11:33.480
I want in on the access.

317
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.313
- [Winston] Actually no.

318
00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:36.029
Dexter and I can handle this one.

319
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.888
We'll just brief you on the.

320
00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:38.973
on the interrogation.

321
00:11:38.973 --> 00:11:39.806
- Okay.

322
00:11:39.806 --> 00:11:41.559
Anything happen to the XZ-9 I
want more information on so.

323
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:44.581
I'll you guys do the interrogation.
I'll review the tapes.

324
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:45.893
- Smart man.

325
00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:46.869
- But not smart enough.

326
00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:48.493
It seems like you guys
have this all handled

327
00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:49.794
and taken care of so

328
00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:51.186
just keep me in the loop.

329
00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:52.019
I'ma head out.

330
00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.576
I'll be on call okay?

331
00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:54.469
- Nash.

332
00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:55.302
- Yeah.

333
00:11:55.302 --> 00:11:58.352
- You know I hear down there
in Florida is nice these days.

334
00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:00.010
The sun. the beaches.

335
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.869
Nice place to get your head in order.

336
00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:02.949
- I think my mind's in order.

337
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:05.165
If I need some tips on vacation.

338
00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:08.138
I'll give you a call okay?

339
00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:08.971
Good day.

340
00:12:12.445 --> 00:12:13.983
- He doing okay?

341
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.968
- He's been upset about Hubbard.

342
00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.525
- Oh you mean the warehouse.

343
00:12:17.525 --> 00:12:19.765
Operation Golden Tiger. right?

344
00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:21.314
- [Mara] I believe so.

345
00:12:21.314 --> 00:12:23.658
- Did he ever mention
that Hubbard said anything

346
00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:25.261
before he went AWOL?

347
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:26.213
- What do you mean?

348
00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.861
- [Winston] Well did he say
any like parting messages

349
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:30.314
so to speak?

350
00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:31.394
- Nash never told me.

351
00:12:31.394 --> 00:12:33.938
- [Dexter] Yeah you are
close though. right?

352
00:12:33.938 --> 00:12:36.829
- We're friends and colleagues.

353
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:38.244
- Friends?

354
00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:41.461
- Is it against office protocol
to have friends Dexter?

355
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:42.610
- No.

356
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.898
No it's not.

357
00:12:43.898 --> 00:12:46.231
- All I know is Nash
is one of our best men.

358
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:48.346
What he did in Iraq is beyond courageous.

359
00:12:48.346 --> 00:12:50.096
Not to mention his covert work.

360
00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:51.579
Moscow. Cuba.

361
00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:53.672
He suffered irreparable brain damage

362
00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:56.025
from those cold war techniques
and still he's smarter

363
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.616
and just as lethal as our
top agents in the field.

364
00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:01.101
- Does he have any family in town?

365
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:03.376
- I think his sister Brenda. she's around.

366
00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:04.386
Other than that I don't know.

367
00:13:04.386 --> 00:13:05.638
- [Dexter] Mara.

368
00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:06.471
All right.

369
00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:08.101
You too make a strong team.

370
00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:10.768
You know about XZ-9 as does Nash

371
00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:14.392
but we got this.

372
00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:15.692
Right?

373
00:13:15.692 --> 00:13:18.359
Take care of him. he needs help.

374
00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:22.085
- Yeah.
Excuse me.

375
00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:24.896
(footsteps pattering)

376
00:13:24.896 --> 00:13:26.216
(Winston sighs)

377
00:13:26.216 --> 00:13:29.666
- Looks like we have a
lot of work ahead of us.

378
00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:33.261
(ominous music)
(footsteps pattering)

379
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:34.642
- Yeah.

380
00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:38.142
(ominous music continues)

381
00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:44.184
So sorry about the way it. Mr. Xieng Huey

382
00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:47.546
Things get a little busy around
here as I'm sure you know.

383
00:13:47.546 --> 00:13:49.879
(gun cocks)

384
00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:51.952
(gun thuds softly)

385
00:13:51.952 --> 00:13:54.785
(chair screeches)

386
00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:59.128
Are you Mr. Xieng Huey?

387
00:13:59.128 --> 00:14:02.045
Are you Mr. Xieng Huey from Yunnan?

388
00:14:10.608 --> 00:14:13.605
Mr. Xieng Huey is it true
that you've been dealing with

389
00:14:13.605 --> 00:14:17.772
poisons and other lab
equipment for over 15 years?

390
00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:21.941
I need you to know that
the more you participate

391
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:24.274
the easier this is gonna be.

392
00:14:25.818 --> 00:14:28.347
We have you tied to
connections with a killing.

393
00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:30.055
a poisoned victim.

394
00:14:30.055 --> 00:14:32.202
Do you know anything about that?

395
00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:34.702
(eerie music)

396
00:14:36.756 --> 00:14:38.686
- Hi. I'm rich.

397
00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:40.764
- Is that your name or
you got a lot of money?

398
00:14:40.764 --> 00:14:41.694
- Yeah I have a lot of money.

399
00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:43.505
You wanna come with me?

400
00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:45.001
- Why don't we cheers to that first?

401
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:46.255
- Okay.

402
00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:48.922
(ominous music)

403
00:14:52.118 --> 00:14:55.009
- I only have so much patience.

404
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.481
The more you cooperate
the better this will be.

405
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.617
I'm gonna ask you one
more time. Mr. Xieng Huey.

406
00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:03.508
Were you involved

407
00:15:03.508 --> 00:15:05.283
in the poisoning

408
00:15:05.283 --> 00:15:08.302
of a Buller Miller Johnson one week ago?

409
00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:12.065
(ominous music continues)

410
00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:14.115
(Buller groans)

411
00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:16.782
(tumbler thuds)

412
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.810
(Dexter sniffs)

413
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.643
Okay.

414
00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:36.016
(ominous music continues)

415
00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:44.847
(file thuds)

416
00:15:44.847 --> 00:15:47.430
(Dexter sighs)

417
00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:53.520
- That was the saddest
interrogation scene I've ever seen.

418
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.847
- He's not bucking it.

419
00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:56.450
I can't get anything out of him.

420
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.397
- I need you to go back in
there and break his skull open.

421
00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:03.230
I need you to get inside his mind.

422
00:16:04.483 --> 00:16:06.483
- You know I can do that

423
00:16:08.104 --> 00:16:10.256
but I'm gonna need a favor from you.

424
00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:11.423
- What's that?

425
00:16:13.027 --> 00:16:14.640
- I need two minutes alone.

426
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.130
No cameras. no nothing.

427
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.093
That's all I need.

428
00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:18.739
Two minutes.

429
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:19.786
- Okay.

430
00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:21.341
I'll do that.

431
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:23.008
- That's all I need.

432
00:16:28.285 --> 00:16:30.478
Got good news. Mr. Xieng Huey.

433
00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:32.013
(file thuds)

434
00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:34.846
Well good news for me not for you.

435
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:41.208
Were you involved in the
murder of Buller Johnson?

436
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:46.208
(ominous music)
(chair thuds)

437
00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:50.608
I'm gonna ask one more time.

438
00:16:50.608 --> 00:16:54.290
Were you involved in the
murder of Buller Johnson?

439
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.026
(Mr. Xieng speaks foreign language)

440
00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:56.859
What?

441
00:16:58.232 --> 00:17:00.298
(Mr. Xieng Huey speaks foreign language)

442
00:17:00.298 --> 00:17:02.965
(ominous music)

443
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.154
- Well that's then.

444
00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:13.314
We have to take out the doctors.

445
00:17:13.314 --> 00:17:16.400
Her friends in Singapore are in standby.

446
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.432
- Well what about the locals?

447
00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:20.767
- The Wan clan?

448
00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:22.194
Screw them.

449
00:17:22.194 --> 00:17:23.361
They talk big.

450
00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:26.392
When they have to fill a contract.

451
00:17:26.392 --> 00:17:27.546
we always come up short.

452
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.082
- What it's sounding like is that

453
00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:31.665
we have nothing to worry about.

454
00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:34.573
Aren't they directly
associated with Singapore?

455
00:17:34.573 --> 00:17:35.406
- Look.

456
00:17:36.569 --> 00:17:38.429
I'll handle the movement.

457
00:17:38.429 --> 00:17:40.970
we just have to get to that shipment first

458
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.376
and Nash.
(Dexter sighs)

459
00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:44.443
I don't know

460
00:17:44.443 --> 00:17:45.550
I have a feeling he's more trouble

461
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.594
than what we bargained on.

462
00:17:47.594 --> 00:17:49.499
- I've got somebody telling him right now.

463
00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:50.915
- Yeah?

464
00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:52.678
You know. I think you
just gave me an idea.

465
00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:54.083
- Yeah. what's that?

466
00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:55.500
- [Winston] Well.

467
00:17:56.664 --> 00:18:00.205
maybe the Wan clan can be
of some use to us still.

468
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.038
- What?

469
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.997
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
Hang on.

470
00:18:02.997 --> 00:18:05.039
We know that they are way
too closely associated

471
00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.071
with official government business.

472
00:18:07.071 --> 00:18:08.737
Okay?
We. every time we work with them

473
00:18:08.737 --> 00:18:11.070
they always find a way to...

474
00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:13.237
I don't trust them.

475
00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:14.954
I don't like it.

476
00:18:14.954 --> 00:18:18.031
- They feed on whatever we give them and

477
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:21.213
they'll disappear soon enough.

478
00:18:21.213 --> 00:18:22.850
- Sounds like things
are going to get messy.

479
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.266
- No Dexter.

480
00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.823
things are gonna be very clean.

481
00:18:26.823 --> 00:18:28.961
It's a dawn of a new day

482
00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:31.961
and once we get control of the XZ-9.

483
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.647
we'll show the world
what damage really is.

484
00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:38.314
(ominous music)

485
00:18:40.983 --> 00:18:42.985
- Do we have plans for this weekend?

486
00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:45.486
- [Mr. Xieng] Not so much.

487
00:18:45.486 --> 00:18:47.403
All right. what's next?

488
00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.258
- Don't forget these XZ-9 samples

489
00:18:50.258 --> 00:18:51.917
have to be shipped off tomorrow.

490
00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:53.431
- Oh goodness.

491
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:55.242
You're right.

492
00:18:55.242 --> 00:18:57.575
I would have totally forgot.

493
00:18:58.506 --> 00:19:00.213
Hey can you hand me some fresh gloves?

494
00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:01.046
- Okay.

495
00:19:03.563 --> 00:19:06.378
(ominous music)

496
00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:07.545
- Who are you?

497
00:19:08.928 --> 00:19:12.717
(woman speaks foreign language)

498
00:19:12.717 --> 00:19:14.538
You can't be in here.

499
00:19:14.538 --> 00:19:15.717
(woman exclaims)
(body thuds)

500
00:19:15.717 --> 00:19:18.573
(man exclaims)

501
00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:22.823
(woman speaks in foreign language)

502
00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:28.615
(woman speaks in foreign language)

503
00:19:32.249 --> 00:19:33.863
- [Nash] I'm actually curious as to

504
00:19:33.863 --> 00:19:36.335
what happened to the footage
from you guys' investigation.

505
00:19:36.335 --> 00:19:37.647
The cameras were off when I came inside.

506
00:19:37.647 --> 00:19:39.784
- Well. it seems like we
were a victim of a hacking

507
00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:41.560
probably from a foreign country but

508
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.218
I had my own team
investigating that right now

509
00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:45.622
and trust me.

510
00:19:45.622 --> 00:19:46.901
we'll keep the lawyers at bay.

511
00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:47.864
- [Nash] We got hacked?

512
00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:50.477
Why didn't you bring this
to my attention earlier?

513
00:19:50.477 --> 00:19:53.817
- Well. we just figured
it out a couple hours ago

514
00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:57.232
and so I'd like to be ahead
of the ball and I'm on it.

515
00:19:57.232 --> 00:19:59.312
I'm taking some more stuff off your plate.

516
00:19:59.312 --> 00:20:00.704
- [Dexter] We'll get the
cameras back up and running

517
00:20:00.704 --> 00:20:02.504
and we'll put him back down.
cross reference everybody

518
00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.372
that we have the confession from him.

519
00:20:04.372 --> 00:20:05.205
That's not a problem.

520
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.038
- You-
- We already have

521
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.008
the confessional on him.
We can pull him out again and
we can ask him one more time.

522
00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:09.146
- The confession is a problem.

523
00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:11.840
I don't trust any investigations
or any interrogations

524
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.324
that have not been recorded.

525
00:20:13.324 --> 00:20:15.426
You guys just wait. let me get more intel.

526
00:20:15.426 --> 00:20:18.549
I'll circle back with you
guys in about 24 hours. okay?

527
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:20.256
- And you authorized those operatives

528
00:20:20.256 --> 00:20:22.554
to be out in the field.

529
00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:26.514
- Those Ops have been out in
the field for over two years.

530
00:20:26.514 --> 00:20:28.279
I'm sure whatever intel they give me

531
00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:30.090
I get right back to you guys shortly.

532
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.564
So for right now.

533
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.147
take some time off.

534
00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:41.597
- Looks like it's time
to take out agent Nash.

535
00:20:41.597 --> 00:20:42.850
- How are we gonna do that?

536
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.289
(ominous music)

537
00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:45.559
He's the head of the department.

538
00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:47.487
- You need to figure that out.

539
00:20:47.487 --> 00:20:49.503
Which I fully trust that you will.

540
00:20:49.503 --> 00:20:52.321
(ominous music continues)

541
00:20:52.321 --> 00:20:57.242
(Mr. Xieng speaks in foreign language)

542
00:20:57.242 --> 00:21:00.781
(ominous music continues)

543
00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:02.362
- [Dexter] Jesus Christ.

544
00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:06.692
- [Winston] It looks like
somebody did our job for us.

545
00:21:06.692 --> 00:21:09.257
- I don't like the look of this.

546
00:21:09.257 --> 00:21:10.813
(Mr. Xieng speaks in foreign language)

547
00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:13.563
(woman whistles)

548
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:17.782
- We're always one step
behind but look what I found.

549
00:21:17.782 --> 00:21:18.615
- What is this?

550
00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:19.770
- Nuclear cyanide.

551
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.687
- Oh Jesus.

552
00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:23.020
- Lethal.

553
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.727
- What do with that?

554
00:21:24.727 --> 00:21:26.506
- We'll be able to use it later trust me.

555
00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:29.802
(ominous music)

556
00:21:29.802 --> 00:21:32.802
(Mr. Xieng screams)

557
00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:37.151
- Our friend at CIA

558
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:39.332
was surprised by your speed.

559
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.458
- When does the payment go through?

560
00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:43.873
- When you and your crew

561
00:21:43.873 --> 00:21:45.788
complete the job.

562
00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:48.239
- You're jerking us around Wan.

563
00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:50.037
We know we did the deed

564
00:21:50.037 --> 00:21:52.264
and now you're trying to maneuver.

565
00:21:52.264 --> 00:21:53.205
What gives?

566
00:21:53.205 --> 00:21:54.914
- The words on the street.

567
00:21:54.914 --> 00:21:56.388
Xieng is not dead.

568
00:21:56.388 --> 00:21:57.502
- That's impossible.

569
00:21:57.502 --> 00:21:59.047
- Impossible?

570
00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:02.076
He's at the Beverly hospital now room 237.

571
00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:04.202
You know what you have to do.

572
00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:06.514
- Let me tell you this.

573
00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:08.514
they only hire the best.

574
00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:11.458
They do their job

575
00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:13.119
and they do it right.

576
00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:16.266
I don't wanna see you again Wan.

577
00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:17.766
Once this is over.

578
00:22:18.762 --> 00:22:19.679
we're done.

579
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.836
- Get outta here.

580
00:22:22.836 --> 00:22:26.924
(ominous music continues)

581
00:22:26.924 --> 00:22:29.757
(keyboard clicks)

582
00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:34.469
(somber music)

583
00:22:38.121 --> 00:22:39.038
- Hey Mara.

584
00:22:40.632 --> 00:22:41.679
(Nash sighs)

585
00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:43.371
Something doesn't sit right with me.

586
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:45.498
- What you thinking about?

587
00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:46.922
- You know when

588
00:22:46.922 --> 00:22:48.540
the Chinese government blamed my unit

589
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.119
for the death of those soldiers.

590
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:52.951
there was two things the
CIA couldn't figure out.

591
00:22:52.951 --> 00:22:55.447
One. who owned the pharmaceutical company

592
00:22:55.447 --> 00:22:59.364
and two what exactly was
the compound for XZ-9.

593
00:23:01.404 --> 00:23:02.564
Where's Dexter and Winston?

594
00:23:02.564 --> 00:23:03.741
- Last I met them they seemed worried

595
00:23:03.741 --> 00:23:05.272
about your mental condition.

596
00:23:05.272 --> 00:23:06.107
(Nash scoffs)

597
00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:08.167
- You think they're really worried
about my mental condition?

598
00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:10.107
- [Mara] No.
- Exactly

599
00:23:10.107 --> 00:23:11.569
but it's fine I'm gonna

600
00:23:11.569 --> 00:23:14.147
do my own digging into
what those guys are up to

601
00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:15.587
'cause I don't trust him for shit.

602
00:23:15.587 --> 00:23:16.539
- Should I run a report?

603
00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:17.372
- No. no. no.

604
00:23:17.372 --> 00:23:19.731
Just. just be careful.

605
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:20.564
Be on look out.

606
00:23:20.564 --> 00:23:21.397
- Okay.

607
00:23:22.257 --> 00:23:23.262
You going out tonight?

608
00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:25.294
- No. I'm actually going
to be staying here.

609
00:23:25.294 --> 00:23:26.950
My sister's coming to visit.

610
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.235
She was on vacation in St. Thomas.

611
00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:31.779
So we're gonna relax. make some food.

612
00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:33.777
have some drinks. catch up.

613
00:23:33.777 --> 00:23:34.926
You should join.

614
00:23:34.926 --> 00:23:36.155
- Sounds nice.

615
00:23:36.155 --> 00:23:38.419
If I can finish this report.

616
00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:39.347
- Don't overwork yourself.

617
00:23:39.347 --> 00:23:41.123
Knock that stuff out and
come hang out with us.

618
00:23:41.123 --> 00:23:42.123
- All right.

619
00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:46.519
(ominous music)

620
00:23:50.587 --> 00:23:52.141
- Here's the best shot we have

621
00:23:52.141 --> 00:23:54.155
to take out our little problem.

622
00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:57.655
(ominous music continues)

623
00:23:59.657 --> 00:24:00.665
- All right let's get it over with.

624
00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:02.146
- Be confident.

625
00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:07.146
(ominous music)
(machine beeps)

626
00:24:11.374 --> 00:24:14.009
Make sure you drank it.

627
00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:15.092
Nighty night.

628
00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:19.138
(Mr. Xieng coughs)

629
00:24:19.138 --> 00:24:22.088
(machine beeps rapidly)

630
00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:23.096
- Is it done?

631
00:24:23.096 --> 00:24:24.762
- It's done.
- A thousand percent.

632
00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:25.723
I don't want to come back.

633
00:24:25.723 --> 00:24:29.556
- You won't hear a peep
from this guy anymore.

634
00:24:33.382 --> 00:24:38.382
(ominous music)
(machine beeps)

635
00:24:48.128 --> 00:24:50.795
(ominous music)

636
00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:55.944
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

637
00:24:55.944 --> 00:24:56.883
Hey you guys can't be here.

638
00:24:56.883 --> 00:24:58.030
Hey. hey. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

639
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.262
(man exclaims)
(man groans)

640
00:25:01.262 --> 00:25:02.262
There we go.

641
00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:04.136
Hey.
(woman exclaims)

642
00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:05.039
(man groans)

643
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.502
(body thuds)

644
00:25:07.502 --> 00:25:09.470
(body thuds)

645
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.435
- No mistakes.

646
00:25:10.435 --> 00:25:11.268
Come on.

647
00:25:11.268 --> 00:25:12.101
(Dexter coughs)
We gotta get out of here.

648
00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:14.865
- [Dexter] I just got my ass kicked.

649
00:25:14.865 --> 00:25:17.532
(ominous music)

650
00:25:20.089 --> 00:25:22.249
(door clicks)

651
00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:23.862
(keys jingle)

652
00:25:23.862 --> 00:25:24.963
- Well hey.

653
00:25:24.963 --> 00:25:26.078
You look like you were sleeping.

654
00:25:26.078 --> 00:25:28.297
- No. No.
Just thinking.

655
00:25:28.297 --> 00:25:29.806
How's it going?

656
00:25:29.806 --> 00:25:31.769
Good to see you.
(Brenda mumbles)

657
00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:33.243
- Nice to see you too bro.
- I missed you.

658
00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:34.798
- Missed you too.

659
00:25:34.798 --> 00:25:36.761
- Have a seat.

660
00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:38.142
How was your flight?

661
00:25:38.142 --> 00:25:39.721
- Long but you know how that goes.

662
00:25:39.721 --> 00:25:40.777
- Yeah true (mumbles)
(Brenda mumbles)

663
00:25:40.777 --> 00:25:42.784
- People. flights

664
00:25:42.784 --> 00:25:44.538
(Brenda mumbles)

665
00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:46.030
- Well here it is.

666
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.038
I have a new place.

667
00:25:48.038 --> 00:25:50.974
- Could use a woman's touch but it's nice.

668
00:25:50.974 --> 00:25:51.807
I like it.

669
00:25:51.807 --> 00:25:53.086
(both chuckle)

670
00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:54.222
Always thinking.

671
00:25:54.222 --> 00:25:55.190
Let me guess. you're probably thinking

672
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.282
about some top CIA mission tomorrow

673
00:25:57.282 --> 00:25:58.989
where you gon' deliver some golden gems

674
00:25:58.989 --> 00:25:59.920
and on the top of space mountain?

675
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.009
- No actually I was thinking about dinner.

676
00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:07.954
- Oh. well. well. well me no
not protest. please come on.

677
00:26:07.954 --> 00:26:08.787
(Nash chuckles)

678
00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:09.620
Get your ass up.

679
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.264
(both laugh)

680
00:26:11.264 --> 00:26:12.226
- Coming up.

681
00:26:12.226 --> 00:26:14.066
- Thanks.
(Brenda chuckles)

682
00:26:14.066 --> 00:26:17.536
(lighthearted music)

683
00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:18.369
- All right.

684
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:19.533
You in for a treat.

685
00:26:19.533 --> 00:26:20.366
- We'll see.

686
00:26:20.366 --> 00:26:22.043
- Tell me what you think
and no holding back.

687
00:26:22.043 --> 00:26:23.554
- Well I will but

688
00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:24.984
mostly by the looks of
it I can already tell

689
00:26:24.984 --> 00:26:25.834
that it's a little
(exclaims)

690
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:27.347
(Nash laughs)
but I'll try it.

691
00:26:27.347 --> 00:26:28.610
(both laugh)

692
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.773
(Brenda mumbles)

693
00:26:29.773 --> 00:26:31.560
now are you sure you don't
want to introduce you?

694
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.927
- I'm quite sure please stop swiping.

695
00:26:33.927 --> 00:26:34.767
Matter of fact no swiping
at the dinner table.

696
00:26:34.767 --> 00:26:37.057
- But she's cute look

697
00:26:37.057 --> 00:26:39.203
and she's a lawyer.

698
00:26:39.203 --> 00:26:40.036
- Okay.

699
00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:41.223
She's a very pretty lady.

700
00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:44.057
I mean and good for her being a lawyer

701
00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:47.644
but I don't need a girlfriend.
a fiance or wife right now.

702
00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:50.292
I am very fine in my
life being the way it is.

703
00:26:50.292 --> 00:26:51.687
- What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:26:51.687 --> 00:26:52.743
You said it like you out there

705
00:26:52.743 --> 00:26:53.780
driving a Porsche or something.

706
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.728
- I don't need a lawyer
to get me out of trouble.

707
00:26:55.728 --> 00:26:57.124
I've got my nice little coop

708
00:26:57.124 --> 00:26:59.897
to whip me in and out of any
problems I have. all right?

709
00:26:59.897 --> 00:27:01.952
- Well if you say so

710
00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:03.345
but this one right here

711
00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:05.113
I know for sure she's
going to be taken soon.

712
00:27:05.113 --> 00:27:06.306
That I know.

713
00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:07.215
- I wouldn't doubt it

714
00:27:07.215 --> 00:27:08.965
and whatever gentlemen grabs her.

715
00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:10.431
she's gonna make a lovely wife.

716
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.508
(both laugh)

717
00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:12.341
- You know what?

718
00:27:12.341 --> 00:27:13.468
All right your loss.

719
00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:14.489
(both laugh)

720
00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:15.906
You are too much.

721
00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:20.689
- Besides you know. mom
told me to take care of you.

722
00:27:20.689 --> 00:27:21.522
- Stop playing.

723
00:27:21.522 --> 00:27:22.355
What?

724
00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:23.188
- Yeah I'm taking care of you.

725
00:27:23.188 --> 00:27:24.623
- You really think that
you're taking care of me?

726
00:27:24.623 --> 00:27:25.623
- I take care of you all the time.

727
00:27:25.623 --> 00:27:26.875
- I'm taking care of you.

728
00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:27.708
(Nash laugh)

729
00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:28.541
You took care of me?

730
00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:29.374
What?

731
00:27:29.374 --> 00:27:30.532
Like those idiots at the club. right?

732
00:27:30.532 --> 00:27:31.645
- That was me taking care of you.

733
00:27:31.645 --> 00:27:32.783
(Brenda laughs)
- No.

734
00:27:32.783 --> 00:27:33.874
- Look in my defense.

735
00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:35.461
both those guys were assholes

736
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:38.327
and what am I supposed to
do as a older brother if

737
00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:41.277
I see two guys hitting on
my sister. grabbing her ass.

738
00:27:41.277 --> 00:27:43.225
moving her around like that.

739
00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:44.389
I took care of it.

740
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:47.197
- You took care of their hospital bill.

741
00:27:47.197 --> 00:27:48.346
- True.

742
00:27:48.346 --> 00:27:49.465
Which I can write off on my taxes.

743
00:27:49.465 --> 00:27:50.941
(Nash laughs)

744
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:53.090
- If you say so.

745
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.673
(phone vibrates)
- Oh shit.

746
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.511
- [Brenda] Uh-oh.

747
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:02.292
No business while I'm visiting.

748
00:28:02.292 --> 00:28:03.125
None.

749
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.719
- Yeah. no. we got company.

750
00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:08.382
- This ain't no CIA dance party.

751
00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:09.763
- No. no. no. it's Mara.

752
00:28:09.763 --> 00:28:11.110
She's one of my new agents.

753
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.502
She's good people though.

754
00:28:12.502 --> 00:28:13.422
- Good people?

755
00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:14.770
So you dating her?

756
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.506
- No. no. no. no not at all.

757
00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:17.409
Come on stop it (mumbles)

758
00:28:17.409 --> 00:28:18.242
- Okay.

759
00:28:18.242 --> 00:28:19.209
- She's new.

760
00:28:19.209 --> 00:28:20.393
We're trying to build a rapport.

761
00:28:20.393 --> 00:28:22.473
Like. you know. I figured we

762
00:28:22.473 --> 00:28:23.707
have her come out. have some drinks.

763
00:28:23.707 --> 00:28:24.605
hang out with us for a bit.

764
00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:25.606
- Wait so she's here?

765
00:28:25.606 --> 00:28:26.439
- Yeah.

766
00:28:26.439 --> 00:28:27.272
She's outside.

767
00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:29.355
- Then invite her ass in.

768
00:28:32.873 --> 00:28:35.414
(ominous music)

769
00:28:35.414 --> 00:28:39.289
(Mr. Wan exclaims)
(sword clanks)

770
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:41.006
(Mr. Wan speaks foreign language)

771
00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:42.203
- Who's the target?

772
00:28:42.203 --> 00:28:44.851
- It's an interesting lead. Billy boy.

773
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:46.246
There's a woman at this house.

774
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.829
This is her picture

775
00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:50.937
but don't show your real face.

776
00:28:50.937 --> 00:28:52.585
This is the agent place.

777
00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:54.558
This agent. he has been known

778
00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:58.203
to go extra length to solve his problem.

779
00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.695
(ominous music)

780
00:28:59.695 --> 00:29:02.597
(drawer clanks)

781
00:29:02.597 --> 00:29:04.245
(masks thud)

782
00:29:04.245 --> 00:29:06.997
- I didn't know Halloween
was approaching so soon.

783
00:29:06.997 --> 00:29:08.993
- I love Halloween.

784
00:29:08.993 --> 00:29:11.247
Just put the goddamn mask.

785
00:29:11.247 --> 00:29:12.080
Go.

786
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.719
Get the fuck out of here.

787
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.093
It's getting late already.

788
00:29:15.093 --> 00:29:17.222
(ominous music continues)

789
00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.306
(sword clanks)

790
00:29:18.306 --> 00:29:21.223
(Mr. Wan exclaims)

791
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:23.054
- Good to see you.

792
00:29:23.054 --> 00:29:24.720
- Oh good to be here.
Thanks for the invite.

793
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.553
- Yeah. no thanks for coming.

794
00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:27.179
- So you're the famous Mara.

795
00:29:27.179 --> 00:29:28.012
- Guilty.

796
00:29:28.012 --> 00:29:29.043
- Yo. yo. (mumbles) be easy. be easy.

797
00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:30.237
(both laugh)

798
00:29:30.237 --> 00:29:31.307
- You must be Brenda.

799
00:29:31.307 --> 00:29:32.467
Nash says you're the best.

800
00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:33.360
- Oh he says that?

801
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.193
- You see.

802
00:29:34.193 --> 00:29:35.026
- I used to hold him down

803
00:29:35.026 --> 00:29:37.029
till he started screaming with laughter.
Just tickling him.

804
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:38.632
- First of all. I say
good things about you.

805
00:29:38.632 --> 00:29:40.420
Secondly my therapist
said. we don't talk about.

806
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.672
(both laugh)

807
00:29:42.672 --> 00:29:43.960
- In all seriousness though.

808
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.120
I'm glad you came Mara.

809
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.786
- Oh thank you.
- Of course.

810
00:29:46.786 --> 00:29:47.848
I hope you ate before you came though.

811
00:29:47.848 --> 00:29:48.681
(Nash exclaims)
- Come on.

812
00:29:48.681 --> 00:29:49.514
- Because.
- No.

813
00:29:49.514 --> 00:29:51.027
- my brother thinks he's a chef but...

814
00:29:51.027 --> 00:29:52.512
(Brenda exclaims)
(Mara laughs)

815
00:29:52.512 --> 00:29:54.067
- Again. the good stuff is in the oven.

816
00:29:54.067 --> 00:29:55.793
it's almost done.
- Oh.
Okay.

817
00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:56.806
- This is just something
to kind of. you know.

818
00:29:56.806 --> 00:29:57.639
get the refuge.

819
00:29:57.639 --> 00:29:58.785
- Of course.
- Thank you.

820
00:29:58.785 --> 00:29:59.618
We drinking?

821
00:29:59.618 --> 00:30:00.451
- Yeah.

822
00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:01.284
See?

823
00:30:01.284 --> 00:30:02.584
A good guest. she brought wine.

824
00:30:02.584 --> 00:30:03.417
Oh we drinking.

825
00:30:03.417 --> 00:30:04.250
We definitely drinking.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.083
We got wine.

827
00:30:05.083 --> 00:30:06.749
We got water.
Purple drink. we got drinks.

828
00:30:06.749 --> 00:30:08.576
- Okay. wait. wait. what is purple drink?

829
00:30:08.576 --> 00:30:10.296
(both laugh)

830
00:30:10.296 --> 00:30:12.486
what'd I miss?
(both mumble)

831
00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:13.576
- Oh lemme play this song.

832
00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:14.409
Okay.

833
00:30:14.409 --> 00:30:15.958
(Nash mumbles)
I got it. I got it.

834
00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:16.791
Remember this song?

835
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:17.624
- Oh see.

836
00:30:17.624 --> 00:30:19.523
- He used to go crazy to this song

837
00:30:19.523 --> 00:30:20.356
- See. you're not ready for this.

838
00:30:20.356 --> 00:30:24.273
See I won five. five.
five. five. five trophies

839
00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:29.435
from the first grade to
sixth grade. talent shows

840
00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:30.526
off of songs like these.

841
00:30:30.526 --> 00:30:31.880
See they weren't ready for all this.

842
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.798
They weren't ready for all of that.

843
00:30:34.798 --> 00:30:35.756
My back.

844
00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:36.674
- [Brenda] Oh my god.
- [Mara] Oh okay.

845
00:30:36.674 --> 00:30:37.507
- My elbow. elbow.

846
00:30:37.507 --> 00:30:38.340
- Oh okay. well if we're playing

847

"That wasn't a pumpkin.

864
00:31:13.278 --> 00:31:14.998
"That was an avocado baby."

865
00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:17.148
I was like. "What the
hell is he on about?"

866
00:31:17.148 --> 00:31:20.081

- [Nash] That was the biggest avocado baby

867
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:21.369
I've ever seen in my life.

868
00:31:21.369 --> 00:31:22.670
- It was not an avocado.

870
00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:26.278

00:31:27.562 --> 00:31:30.093
I mean it was rough mom but

873
00:31:30.093 --> 00:31:32.450
she raised us all in her effort right?

874
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.368
- She did a great job.

875
00:31:33.368 --> 00:31:34.437
She taught me a lot.

876
00:31:34.437 --> 00:31:36.466
She taught me how to pay attention.

877
00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:37.920
- You can say that again.

878
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.051
(ominous music)

879
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:42.330
- But what about you honey?

880
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.615
- I was recruited actually but...

881
00:31:45.615 --> 00:31:48.392
(ominous music continues)

882
00:31:48.392 --> 00:31:51.445
- You seem so pretty and proper.

883
00:31:51.445 --> 00:31:53.906
Nash did tell me though you
were excellent in combat.

884
00:31:53.906 --> 00:31:55.898
I could not deal with all of that fight.

885
00:31:55.898 --> 00:31:58.242
- I was always a bit
of a tomboy. I'm sorry.

886
00:31:58.242 --> 00:32:00.842
Nash you burning tomorrow
night's dinner too?

887
00:32:00.842 --> 00:32:01.675
(all coughing)

888
00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:02.640
- [Nash] That's not smoke.

889
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.605
That's gas.

890
00:32:03.605 --> 00:32:04.938
(Nash coughing)

891
00:32:04.938 --> 00:32:06.533
Intruders.

892
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:07.904
(man exclaims)

893
00:32:07.904 --> 00:32:08.910
(body thuds)

894
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.120
(knife clanks)

895
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.600

896
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.909
(ominous music)

897
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:18.409

898
00:32:19.426 --> 00:32:21.341

900
00:32:23.152 --> 00:32:26.922
- and (mumbles) worried about you.

901
00:32:26.922 --> 00:32:30.422
(ominous music continues)

902
00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:47.316
(Nash groans)

903
00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:51.049
- Mara.

904
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.277
Wake up.

905
00:32:56.277 --> 00:32:57.110
Wake up.

906
00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:11.322
Brenda.

907
00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.754
Brenda!

908
00:33:12.754 --> 00:33:15.239
(door slams)

909
00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:18.185
(phone vibrates)

910
00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:19.220
- Winston.

911
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.320
- [Winston] Nash. how are you buddy?

912
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.143
- Yeah they. they came and took my sister.

913
00:33:24.143 --> 00:33:26.324
- [Winston] Did they tell
you what they wanted?

914
00:33:26.324 --> 00:33:27.426
- What?

915
00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:28.259
No.

916
00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:29.092
They gassed my place.

917
00:33:29.092 --> 00:33:30.820
it happened so fast I
don't know what happened.

918
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.727
- [Winston] What do you think you did

919
00:33:31.727 --> 00:33:34.815
that would make someone
wanna take your sister?

920
00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:37.031
Any ideas about that old buddy?

921
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:38.820
- Are you tryna be funny?

922
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.965
- Oh. we had a debrief this morning.

923
00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:42.895
Neither you or Mara were present.

924
00:33:42.895 --> 00:33:45.636
We checked around no
one heard shit from you.

925
00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:47.061
Thought you might have taken my advice

926
00:33:47.061 --> 00:33:50.268
and gotten the hell out of Dodge.

927
00:33:50.268 --> 00:33:51.752
- No.

928
00:33:51.752 --> 00:33:53.682
What is. what's happening to me?

929
00:33:53.682 --> 00:33:56.143
- [Winston] Must be Iraq
is catching up with you.

930
00:33:56.143 --> 00:33:58.726
(somber music)

931
00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.076
(glass clanks)

932
00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:07.596
(door knocks)

933
00:34:07.596 --> 00:34:08.898
- Who is it?

934
00:34:08.898 --> 00:34:09.898
- Mr. Smoke.

935
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:13.578
(Mr. Wan sighs)

936
00:34:14.522 --> 00:34:16.890
(gun cocks)

937
00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:18.831
(gun thuds softly)

938
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:20.980
- Come in Mr. Smoke.

939
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.188
You are late.

940
00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:26.445
(ominous music)
(door clicks)

941
00:34:26.445 --> 00:34:27.861
(door clicks)

942
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:29.914
- Well. we happy?

943
00:34:29.914 --> 00:34:31.551
- Indeed.

944
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:33.178
We got the girl.

945
00:34:33.178 --> 00:34:35.912
Ancy's in route to the warehouse.

946
00:34:35.912 --> 00:34:37.898
- What about the XZ-9?

947
00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:40.847
- The mother load. Mr. Smoke?

948
00:34:40.847 --> 00:34:41.847
Due in time.

949
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.240
Our partner get the first dib.

950
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.066
(ice rattles)

951
00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:52.191
My warrior prepare

952
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:53.441
for the battle.

953
00:35:00.503 --> 00:35:01.425
(Winston exclaims)

954
00:35:01.425 --> 00:35:02.900
(Winston panting)

955
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.279
- Now drink.

956
00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:05.112
- Oh no. no.

957
00:35:05.112 --> 00:35:06.362
- Take a drink.

958
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.303
You and your so-called agent.

959
00:35:10.303 --> 00:35:12.740
if anything happen to me

960
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.116
my warrior will (mumbles)

961
00:35:15.116 --> 00:35:17.934
(mumbles) prone to hell

962
00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:19.743
and suck your blood dry.

963
00:35:19.743 --> 00:35:20.576
- No.

964
00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.530
- You hear me?

965
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:22.423
- Yes. yes.

966
00:35:22.423 --> 00:35:23.383
- Do you hear me?

967
00:35:23.383 --> 00:35:24.216
- Yes.

968
00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:27.168
Yes.

969
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.433
(glass clanks)

970
00:35:35.272 --> 00:35:37.852
- You are trouble.
(Winston panting)

971
00:35:37.852 --> 00:35:38.685
- Nash.

972
00:35:40.935 --> 00:35:43.476
That bitch's brother.

973
00:35:43.476 --> 00:35:46.476
We need him to take a long vacation.

974
00:35:48.108 --> 00:35:49.503
- I see.

975
00:35:49.503 --> 00:35:51.086
A private vacation.

976
00:35:52.927 --> 00:35:55.213
- There's this dive bar he likes to go.

977
00:35:55.213 --> 00:35:57.938
The Peak Oyster (mumbles)

978
00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:59.334
You take him there

979
00:35:59.334 --> 00:36:01.191
but before you finish him off

980
00:36:01.191 --> 00:36:03.157
interrogate his ass.

981
00:36:03.157 --> 00:36:05.324
There's a code phrase that

982
00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:10.519
was passed to him from his ex partner.

983
00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:12.722
It's a value to us.

984
00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:15.871
- You want me to do your dirty work?

985
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:18.287
Classic CIA maneuver.

986
00:36:18.287 --> 00:36:19.924
- The pay will be double.

987
00:36:19.924 --> 00:36:21.247
How's that for a maneuver?

988
00:36:21.247 --> 00:36:23.247
- As you wish Mr. Smoke.

989
00:36:26.298 --> 00:36:29.130
(Winston chuckles)

990
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.549
(Winston coughs)

991
00:36:30.549 --> 00:36:31.858
Oh God damn.

992
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.948
You drink this shit you'll die.

993
00:36:33.948 --> 00:36:35.865
- Everything will kill.

994
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.613
Everything

995
00:36:38.964 --> 00:36:40.797
on this ratchet earth.

996
00:36:41.762 --> 00:36:44.069
- I'll set up Nash. okay?

997
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:46.069
I'll set him up Mr. Wan.

998
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.007
- You better.

999
00:36:48.007 --> 00:36:49.674
- Just take him out.

1000
00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:51.631
(door clicks)

1001
00:36:51.631 --> 00:36:54.298
(ominous music)

1002
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:58.189
(birds chirping)

1003
00:37:00.836 --> 00:37:03.669
(keyboard clicks)

1004
00:37:12.956 --> 00:37:13.914
- [Mara] See I can place that

1005
00:37:13.914 --> 00:37:16.413
there were active cell signals
in the area last night but

1006
00:37:16.413 --> 00:37:20.316
in this neighborhood it's
like a complete blackout.

1007
00:37:20.316 --> 00:37:21.871
- What about the cameras?

1008
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:23.390
- The only one clear enough to make out

1009
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.388
is the intersection down the street.

1010
00:37:25.388 --> 00:37:26.876
Black sedan. two females.

1011
00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:27.709
- Yeah.

1012
00:37:27.709 --> 00:37:28.836
It had to be two females.

1013
00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:30.252
I mean I gotta get my head cleared out

1014
00:37:30.252 --> 00:37:31.636
but I at least remember seeing that.

1015
00:37:31.636 --> 00:37:33.481
- This was intentional but no demands yet.

1016
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:35.316
- Not a damn thing?

1017
00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.149
- Nothing.

1018
00:37:39.401 --> 00:37:40.401
They'll be in touch.

1019
00:37:40.401 --> 00:37:43.233
If they call your cell we
can ping almost immediately.

1020
00:37:43.233 --> 00:37:44.969
How do you wanna proceed?

1021
00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:45.802
(Nash sighs)

1022
00:37:45.802 --> 00:37:47.639
- I need some time.

1023
00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:50.065
Gonna meditate on it. I'll be in touch.

1024
00:37:50.065 --> 00:37:51.315
- I understand.

1025
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.806
Don't worry Nash.

1026
00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:55.807
I already filed the report

1027
00:37:55.807 --> 00:37:58.116
and I'll brief Winston and Dexter on it.

1028
00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.009
You'll come in later.

1029
00:37:59.009 --> 00:38:00.031
- I really appreciate everything.

1030
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:01.876
You are.
- Of course.

1031
00:38:01.876 --> 00:38:04.849
- really sweet and pure and

1032
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.788
I do not wanna get you
to wrapped up into this.

1033
00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:08.121
- It'll be okay.

1034
00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:11.349
- You are quickly becoming
my new best friend.

1035
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:13.766
(Nash laugh)

1036
00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:19.848
- We could be more than friends.

1037
00:38:19.848 --> 00:38:22.412
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.

1038
00:38:22.412 --> 00:38:25.412
Mara I just can't do that right now.

1039
00:38:26.443 --> 00:38:27.693
You are amazing

1040
00:38:29.784 --> 00:38:32.515
but right now I need to keep my head clear

1041
00:38:32.515 --> 00:38:35.015
and you would be a distraction

1042
00:38:36.693 --> 00:38:39.779
but I thank you for everything.

1043
00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:42.243
(somber music)

1044
00:38:42.243 --> 00:38:43.076
Come here.

1045
00:38:45.597 --> 00:38:48.097
(Nash kisses)

1046
00:38:52.493 --> 00:38:54.410
- Sylvia. it's me Nash.

1047
00:38:56.848 --> 00:38:58.923
I really need to talk.

1048
00:38:58.923 --> 00:38:59.983
Face to face though.

1049
00:38:59.983 --> 00:39:02.420
Can you come to my place?

1050
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.670
It's 3324 East River drive.

1051
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.084
I just need to talk to you.

1052
00:39:10.084 --> 00:39:11.543
So please come.

1053
00:39:11.543 --> 00:39:15.007

- What did you wanna talk about?

1073
00:39:53.284 --> 00:39:56.436
Why couldn't we talk over the phone?

1074
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:58.132
- To be honest I know you're
working on a bunch of missions

1075
00:39:58.132 --> 00:39:59.735
I'm not supposed to know about

1076
00:39:59.735 --> 00:40:01.475
but a couple of operatives
came in my place

1077
00:40:01.475 --> 00:40:02.693
and took my sister.

1078
00:40:02.693 --> 00:40:03.526
- Your sister?

1079
00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:04.359
- Yes.

1080
00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:05.776
This is personal.

1081
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.150
So please.

1082
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:12.331
I need to know what intel
you know about XZ-9.

1083
00:40:12.331 --> 00:40:14.831
- What's the password to Play?

1084
00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:20.366
- "The wind dances where it
wants not where we will it."

1085
00:40:20.366 --> 00:40:22.154
- That is the code.

1086
00:40:22.154 --> 00:40:24.586
I got intel that the Wans are

1087
00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:27.220
moving a large shipment of XZ-9

1088
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.631
via freight to Singapore
and then to China.

1089
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:31.740
- Where they now?

1090
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.108
- If it's the Wans you want

1091
00:40:33.108 --> 00:40:36.116
they run coke out of The Pink Oyster.

1092
00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:39.356
- Yeah they came back to me at my club.

1093
00:40:39.356 --> 00:40:42.154
- I would say go to The
Oyster but be careful.

1094
00:40:42.154 --> 00:40:43.698
- Yeah.

1095
00:40:43.698 --> 00:40:44.743
Yeah.

1096
00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:47.087
They never wanted my sister.

1097
00:40:47.087 --> 00:40:49.050
- They'll come after you too.

1098
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.444
- I know

1099
00:40:50.444 --> 00:40:53.361
but not if I come after them first.

1100
00:40:54.924 --> 00:40:55.757
Thank you.

1101
00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:00.479

No that can't be right.

1124
00:42:08.727 --> 00:42:10.060
- What can't be?

1125
00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:13.986
I didn't know you work this late.

1126
00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:16.215
- I'm on the XZ-9 operation.

1127
00:42:16.215 --> 00:42:17.735
- I thought Winston took you off of that.

1128
00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.106
- Not since last night.

1129
00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:21.939
We were hit. possibly compromised.

1130
00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:24.063
- Well it sounds like you
should do the right thing

1131
00:42:24.063 --> 00:42:25.980
and stay off the field.

1132
00:42:27.988 --> 00:42:30.751
- I was just wrapping up.

1133
00:42:30.751 --> 00:42:32.178
What are you doing here?

1134
00:42:32.178 --> 00:42:34.002
- Well I was hoping to
speak with Nash but-

1135
00:42:34.002 --> 00:42:36.214
- He's the man of the hour.
- Indeed he is.

1136
00:42:41.194 --> 00:42:43.076
- Actually I was going to tell you.

1137
00:42:43.076 --> 00:42:44.606
I think after this case.

1138
00:42:44.606 --> 00:42:47.871
I will be taking those vacation hours.

1139
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:49.159
- Oh well you've earned 'em.

1140
00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:51.018
I'm sure Winston wouldn't mind.

1141
00:42:51.018 --> 00:42:54.327
- I mean XZ-9 has everyone
on edge. you don't feel that?

1142
00:42:54.327 --> 00:42:55.743
- No.

1143
00:42:55.743 --> 00:42:57.495
Everything's just fine.

1144
00:42:57.495 --> 00:42:59.132
Always been.

1145
00:42:59.132 --> 00:43:00.618
Why do you ask?

1146
00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:03.556
- No reason. you're right.

1147
00:43:03.556 --> 00:43:05.159
(ominous music)

1148
00:43:05.159 --> 00:43:06.742
- Leave XZ-9 to us.

1149
00:43:08.024 --> 00:43:09.313
No more overtime

1150
00:43:09.313 --> 00:43:12.218
and you can go back to
your online operations.

1151
00:43:12.218 --> 00:43:13.218
We got this.

1152
00:43:15.477 --> 00:43:17.381
- Well then. I'll be going.

1153
00:43:17.381 --> 00:43:20.372
(footsteps pattering)
(ominous music continues)

1154
00:43:20.372 --> 00:43:21.289
- Hey Mara.

1155
00:43:22.879 --> 00:43:26.591
If you see Nash can you
tell him to meet me in here?

1156
00:43:26.591 --> 00:43:27.708
- Fine.

1157
00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:30.375
(ominous music)

1158
00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:42.754
- You know. your brother and
I used to be good friends.

1159
00:43:42.754 --> 00:43:45.671
In fact he even helped save my life

1160
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.642
during the mission.

1161
00:43:48.642 --> 00:43:52.142
I took a bullet and they gave him a medal!

1162
00:43:53.516 --> 00:43:55.479
(Winston laughs)

1163
00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:56.312
Priceless.

1164
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:04.004
They didn't even give me
three months sick leave.

1165
00:44:04.004 --> 00:44:04.837
Mr. Wan.

1166
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.044
he's giving me enough money

1167
00:44:09.044 --> 00:44:10.806
where I can buy my own island.

1168
00:44:10.806 --> 00:44:11.956
In fact.

1169
00:44:11.956 --> 00:44:15.022
when XZ-9 hits the
streets in three months.

1170
00:44:15.022 --> 00:44:17.628
hell. I may even by two.

1171
00:44:17.628 --> 00:44:20.887
(Winston chuckles)
(ominous music)

1172
00:44:20.887 --> 00:44:23.970
(lighthearted music)

1173
00:44:25.228 --> 00:44:26.250
- Casey can I get another one?

1174
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:27.083
- [Casey] Yeap.

1175
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:32.546
- Thanks.
(lighthearted music continues)

1176
00:44:32.546 --> 00:44:33.379
- [Casey] There you go.

1177
00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:35.079
- Appreciate it.

1178
00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:37.579
(eerie music)

1179
00:45:06.005 --> 00:45:07.852
- Everyone get the hell out.

1180
00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:08.685
- Now.

1181
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:15.225
- The Wan clan.

1182
00:45:15.225 --> 00:45:16.257
- Poor boy.

1183
00:45:16.257 --> 00:45:19.137
- We will kill your sister next.

1184
00:45:19.137 --> 00:45:22.249
- You touch my sister
I'll make sure you
never fucking walk again

1185
00:45:22.249 --> 00:45:23.676
and you in this cheap suit.

1186
00:45:23.676 --> 00:45:25.637
I make sure they bury you in it.

1187
00:45:25.637 --> 00:45:27.220
- You talk too much

1188
00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:29.204
but don't worry

1189
00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:30.855
maybe your sister will join you in hell.

1190
00:45:30.855 --> 00:45:33.196
- How about you go first
and tell me how it is.

1191
00:45:33.196 --> 00:45:34.946
- Big boy. big words.

1192
00:45:36.017 --> 00:45:38.017
(snaps)

1193
00:45:39.593 --> 00:45:40.955
(body thuds)

1194
00:45:40.955 --> 00:45:42.182
(man exclaims)

1195
00:45:42.182 --> 00:45:44.599
(body thuds)

1196
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:49.246
(body thuds)

1197
00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:53.445
(knife clanks)

1198
00:45:53.445 --> 00:45:54.757
(Nash slaps)

1199
00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:56.963
(dramatic music)

1200
00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:58.176
- [Man] You're dead.

1201
00:45:58.176 --> 00:45:59.552
(man exclaims)
(dramatic music)

1202
00:45:59.552 --> 00:46:01.969
(body thuds)

1203
00:46:08.404 --> 00:46:10.821
(man groans)

1204
00:46:13.455 --> 00:46:14.466
(woman pants)

1205
00:46:14.466 --> 00:46:15.299
- Kill him.

1206
00:46:15.299 --> 00:46:16.132
(knife clanks)

1207
00:46:16.132 --> 00:46:17.571
(dramatic music continues)

1208
00:46:17.571 --> 00:46:20.321
(sword whooshes)

1209
00:46:25.075 --> 00:46:27.658
(sword clanks)

1210
00:46:34.257 --> 00:46:37.007
(woman exclaims)

1211
00:46:39.193 --> 00:46:40.327
- You okay?

1212
00:46:40.327 --> 00:46:41.478
(Nash pants)

1213
00:46:41.478 --> 00:46:44.604
- Thanks for showing up on time.

1214
00:46:44.604 --> 00:46:46.247
Let's go.

1215
00:46:46.247 --> 00:46:47.663
I wanted you to watch.

1216
00:46:47.663 --> 00:46:48.847
- What the hell happened?

1217
00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:53.847
(dramatic music)
(sirens blaring)

1218
00:47:05.647 --> 00:47:07.458
Did you know those people at the bar?

1219
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:09.386
- I sure as hell do now.

1220
00:47:09.386 --> 00:47:11.858
I know the Wan clan was running
the pharmaceutical company

1221
00:47:11.858 --> 00:47:13.845
that was making exiting XZ-9.

1222
00:47:13.845 --> 00:47:15.863
If that's the case. that
means their old boss Wan

1223
00:47:15.863 --> 00:47:18.487
is up to the same tricks he was in before.

1224
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:23.354
Do any intel for any labs or
warehouses next to the pier.

1225
00:47:23.354 --> 00:47:26.191
Anything pops up I guarantee
you that's where Brenda is.

1226
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:28.086
- And Dexter came around looking for.

1227
00:47:28.086 --> 00:47:31.230
- No. I don't trust him or Winston.

1228
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:33.774
- I think it's worse than that.

1229
00:47:33.774 --> 00:47:37.348
I think that they're double agents.

1230
00:47:37.348 --> 00:47:38.523
- Really?

1231
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:39.356
- Really.

1232
00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:43.515
- Tell you what. you drum
up any intel you can.

1233
00:47:43.515 --> 00:47:45.776
you let me deal with Winston and Dexter.

1234
00:47:45.776 --> 00:47:48.609
(keyboard clicks)

1235
00:47:49.528 --> 00:47:51.838
And Mara.
(lighthearted music)

1236
00:47:51.838 --> 00:47:53.560
thank you you've been
saving my ass back there.

1237
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.339
(Mara chuckles)

1238
00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:59.256
- Anytime.
(lighthearted music)

1239
00:48:07.035 --> 00:48:12.035
(footsteps pattering)
(eerie music)

1240
00:48:23.944 --> 00:48:24.777
- Dexter.

1241
00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:28.111
- I was hoping you would show up.

1242
00:48:28.111 --> 00:48:29.563
- I'm gonna cut you up.

1243
00:48:29.563 --> 00:48:30.816
(gunshot fires)

1244
00:48:30.816 --> 00:48:33.233
(body thuds)

1245
00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:37.319
(eerie music continues)

1246
00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:38.794
(footsteps pattering)

1247
00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:41.906
- I can't believe you betrayed the agency.

1248
00:48:41.906 --> 00:48:44.727
- Shouldn't dig up memories
of old military murders.

1249
00:48:44.727 --> 00:48:46.770
Who knows what kind of
skeletons you'll find there.

1250
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.917
(Nash scoffs)

1251
00:48:47.917 --> 00:48:50.681
- You must wanna be buried
with the rest of those bodies.

1252
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:53.226
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

1253
00:48:53.226 --> 00:48:55.106
- Not as much as me.

1254
00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:56.058
(Dexter exclaims)

1255
00:48:56.058 --> 00:48:57.635
(dramatic music)

1256
00:48:57.635 --> 00:49:00.218
(both exclaim)

1257
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:09.031
(thuds)

1258
00:49:14.022 --> 00:49:15.609
(chair rattles)

1259
00:49:15.609 --> 00:49:20.609
(thuds)
(dramatic music continues)

1260
00:49:22.385 --> 00:49:24.385
(thuds)

1261
00:49:30.638 --> 00:49:33.084
(Dexter exclaims)

1262
00:49:33.084 --> 00:49:35.084
(thuds)

1263
00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.410
(bones crushing)

1264
00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:47.940
(bones crushing)
(body thuds)

1265
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:52.152
(dramatic music intensifies)

1266
00:49:52.152 --> 00:49:54.735
(Nash panting)

1267
00:49:55.994 --> 00:49:56.975
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1268
00:49:56.975 --> 00:49:59.380
(gunshot fires)

1269
00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.458
(glass breaks)

1270
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:03.786
Wan sent you?

1271
00:50:03.786 --> 00:50:05.191
- [Man] That's right.

1272
00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:07.228
Boss Wan sends his regards.

1273
00:50:07.228 --> 00:50:08.061
(gunshots fire)

1274
00:50:08.061 --> 00:50:09.999
- Tell your boss to go fuck himself.

1275
00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:11.076
(gunshots fire)

1276
00:50:11.076 --> 00:50:12.352
Tell you what.

1277
00:50:12.352 --> 00:50:15.756
You walk away or not. I
will fucking kill you.

1278
00:50:15.756 --> 00:50:18.879
- Your death will be my pleasure.

1279
00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:21.442
(gunshot fires)
(gun clicks)

1280
00:50:21.442 --> 00:50:22.951
- You know what?

1281
00:50:22.951 --> 00:50:24.284
I love pleasure.

1282
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:27.058
Bring it bitch.

1283
00:50:27.058 --> 00:50:29.210
(dramatic music)

1284
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:30.868
(glass breaks)

1285
00:50:30.868 --> 00:50:32.180
(both exclaim)

1286
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.714
(dramatic music intensifies)

1287
00:50:34.714 --> 00:50:37.131
(body thuds)

1288
00:50:38.628 --> 00:50:41.295
(both grunting)

1289
00:51:13.097 --> 00:51:15.680
(bottle thuds)

1290
00:51:19.447 --> 00:51:23.114
- Did you always wanna
do this kind of work?

1291
00:51:25.064 --> 00:51:26.503
- Not really.

1292
00:51:26.503 --> 00:51:29.246
My father was in the military.

1293
00:51:29.246 --> 00:51:31.531
National guard actually.

1294
00:51:31.531 --> 00:51:33.807
Tried warning me about it but you know.

1295
00:51:33.807 --> 00:51:37.119
stupid kid I wasn't willing
to really take his advice.

1296
00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:38.452
- [Sylvia] Yeah.

1297
00:51:39.671 --> 00:51:40.740
(Nash sighs)

1298
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.407
- I wish I would listen.

1299
00:51:43.407 --> 00:51:44.824
Things I've seen.

1300
00:51:46.044 --> 00:51:46.877
Iraq.

1301
00:51:48.394 --> 00:51:51.623
You just don't recover
from that. you know.

1302
00:51:51.623 --> 00:51:54.420
- What did you wanna do?

1303
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.183
- Never got a chance to figure it out.

1304
00:51:57.183 --> 00:51:58.016
Pops.

1305
00:51:59.284 --> 00:52:01.617
he left when I was about 14.

1306
00:52:02.663 --> 00:52:04.663
Everything he showed me.

1307
00:52:05.636 --> 00:52:06.469
military.

1308
00:52:07.423 --> 00:52:08.256
training.

1309
00:52:09.978 --> 00:52:10.811
focusing.

1310
00:52:12.322 --> 00:52:15.397
everything geared me towards this life.

1311
00:52:15.397 --> 00:52:17.130
(somber music)

1312
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:21.762
To be honest I don't know
what I would do if I left.

1313
00:52:21.762 --> 00:52:23.095
- How about you?

1314
00:52:24.547 --> 00:52:26.437
- I was a military brat

1315
00:52:26.437 --> 00:52:28.612
and my dad was in the CIA.

1316
00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.279
I was basically raised for this.

1317
00:52:32.988 --> 00:52:36.488
I excelled in explosives to say the least.

1318
00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.743
I really liked blow torches.

1319
00:52:43.287 --> 00:52:44.120
Yeah.

1320
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:47.711
- You get burned that way.

1321
00:52:47.711 --> 00:52:48.626
- It's all right.

1322
00:52:48.626 --> 00:52:50.709
I like playing with fire.

1323
00:52:58.287 --> 00:52:59.787
Can you hear that?

1324
00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:03.372
- What?

1325
00:53:03.372 --> 00:53:04.539
- The silence.

1326
00:53:07.842 --> 00:53:09.759
Something's in the air.

1327
00:53:11.394 --> 00:53:13.227
It's always present.

1328
00:53:13.227 --> 00:53:15.310
always moving us forward.

1329
00:53:16.178 --> 00:53:18.845
If we just stopped and listened.

1330
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.063
who chose who we really are.

1331
00:53:24.552 --> 00:53:26.704
- Now I'm worried about tomorrow.

1332
00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:28.899
- [Sylvia] You're not there.

1333
00:53:28.899 --> 00:53:31.303
you're here with me.

1334
00:53:31.303 --> 00:53:32.997
What are you so worried about?

1335
00:53:32.997 --> 00:53:35.639
- I just can't stop thinking
about what happened.

1336
00:53:35.639 --> 00:53:37.661
Everything in Iraq.

1337
00:53:37.661 --> 00:53:39.828
My team is basically gone.

1338
00:53:40.842 --> 00:53:42.850
Hubbard lord knows where.

1339
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.194
Winston traded on me.

1340
00:53:45.194 --> 00:53:50.194
You're here. I thank you for
that but anything can go wrong

1341
00:53:50.418 --> 00:53:53.391
and I saw what happened
last time with XZ-9.

1342
00:53:53.391 --> 00:53:55.922
Hundreds of soldiers were killed.

1343
00:53:55.922 --> 00:53:59.161
If that gets out into the world it's over.

1344
00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:00.706
- Yeah.

1345
00:54:00.706 --> 00:54:05.706
Well then I guess you better
get ready to save the world.

1346
00:54:06.173 --> 00:54:07.509
- With you?

1347
00:54:07.509 --> 00:54:09.009
- Yeah. of course.

1348
00:54:10.932 --> 00:54:11.932
- Thank you.

1349
00:54:13.802 --> 00:54:15.101
- And Nash.

1350
00:54:15.101 --> 00:54:16.445
- Yeah?

1351
00:54:16.445 --> 00:54:17.862
- we can do this.

1352
00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:21.651
We just. we just have to believe.

1353
00:54:22.975 --> 00:54:24.058
I believe it.

1354
00:54:27.954 --> 00:54:30.454
(both kisses)

1355
00:54:38.095 --> 00:54:40.762
(ominous music)

1356
00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:59.799
- Hey.

1357
00:54:59.799 --> 00:55:02.047
So. got anymore
information about the XZ-9?

1358
00:55:02.047 --> 00:55:05.547
(ominous music continues)

1359
00:55:06.645 --> 00:55:08.213
- Yes.

1360
00:55:08.213 --> 00:55:10.787
I made copies for Thursday plan for you

1361
00:55:10.787 --> 00:55:12.007
- It's all right.

1362
00:55:12.007 --> 00:55:13.890
- and then this.

1363
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.640
(dramatic music)

1364
00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:23.988
- Check this out and I'll

1365
00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:26.404
see you back at the briefing
around three o'clock.

1366
00:55:26.404 --> 00:55:27.474
- Okay sounds good.

1367
00:55:27.474 --> 00:55:28.307
Okay.

1368
00:55:28.307 --> 00:55:30.365
(dramatic music continues)

1369
00:55:30.365 --> 00:55:33.282
(buttons clicking)

1370
00:55:35.945 --> 00:55:37.112
- God damn it.

1371
00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.544
(phone thuds)

1372
00:55:39.544 --> 00:55:42.467
(fire alarm blares)

1373
00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:44.392
What the hell is the fire alarm?

1374
00:55:44.392 --> 00:55:46.920
(footsteps pattering)

1375
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.753
Oh really?

1376
00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:50.184
You?

1377
00:55:50.184 --> 00:55:52.482
Didn't I take care of you at the bar?

1378
00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.722
- Guess I couldn't get
enough of your pretty face.

1379
00:55:54.722 --> 00:55:55.555
(man exclaims)

1380
00:55:55.555 --> 00:55:58.305
(dramatic music)

1381
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.973
Want more?

1382
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.542
(man exclaims)

1383
00:56:10.542 --> 00:56:14.292
(dramatic music intensifies)

1384
00:56:16.176 --> 00:56:18.679
(man exclaims)

1385
00:56:18.679 --> 00:56:21.096
(body thuds)

1386
00:56:29.738 --> 00:56:32.571
(bones crackling)

1387
00:56:34.522 --> 00:56:36.253
- You gon' kill me?

1388
00:56:36.253 --> 00:56:37.818
Not if I can help it.

1389
00:56:37.818 --> 00:56:39.818
(thuds)

1390
00:56:40.746 --> 00:56:43.413
(ominous music)

1391
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:52.888
(glass clanks)
(phone rings)

1392
00:56:52.888 --> 00:56:55.555
(ominous music)

1393
00:56:56.466 --> 00:56:57.728
- What?

1394
00:56:57.728 --> 00:56:59.106
Goddamn it.

1395
00:56:59.106 --> 00:57:00.973
How could he?

1396
00:57:00.973 --> 00:57:04.088
I sent four of you guys
over there to kill him.

1397
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:07.083
Move to the east side
of the warehouse now.

1398
00:57:07.083 --> 00:57:08.443
(phone clicks)
(Mr. Wan groans)

1399
00:57:08.443 --> 00:57:09.835
Goddamn it.

1400
00:57:09.835 --> 00:57:11.241
(gun cocks)

1401
00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:13.329
I'm gonna kill Nash.

1402
00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:14.304
Kill you.

1403
00:57:14.304 --> 00:57:15.270
Kill you.

1404
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.163
Kill you.

1405
00:57:16.163 --> 00:57:17.683
(Mr. Wan screams)

1406
00:57:17.683 --> 00:57:20.433
(dramatic music)

1407
00:57:29.665 --> 00:57:30.734
- Baby you okay?

1408
00:57:30.734 --> 00:57:33.497
- [Sylvia] I'm worried Nash.

1409
00:57:33.497 --> 00:57:36.433
Our last mission together.

1410
00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:38.478
you almost died.

1411
00:57:38.478 --> 00:57:40.395
I don't wanna lose you.

1412
00:57:41.462 --> 00:57:44.677
I thought I would never see you again.

1413
00:57:44.677 --> 00:57:47.406
- You're not gonna lose me

1414
00:57:47.406 --> 00:57:49.656
and if you close your eyes.

1415
00:57:50.681 --> 00:57:52.990
I'll always be there.

1416
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.395
- It's the Wan clan though.

1417
00:57:55.395 --> 00:57:58.147
What are the chances that
you and I make it out alive?

1418
00:57:58.147 --> 00:58:00.105
- Come on baby.

1419
00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:01.994
I'm not afraid to die.

1420
00:58:01.994 --> 00:58:04.084
I've been on so many missions that

1421
00:58:04.084 --> 00:58:08.881
I've come so close to death
I barely feel alive now.

1422
00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:12.561
- I know a way to make you feel alive.

1423
00:58:12.561 --> 00:58:15.394
It's an ancient tantric technique.

1424
00:58:16.358 --> 00:58:18.191
You just have to relax

1425
00:58:19.563 --> 00:58:21.966
and let me take control.

1426
00:58:21.966 --> 00:58:25.158
- So is this supposed to
prepare us for tomorrow?

1427
00:58:25.158 --> 00:58:27.908
- It'll give you strength.

1428
00:58:27.908 --> 00:58:29.075
the best kind.

1429
00:58:32.506 --> 00:58:35.294
(both kisses)

1430
00:58:35.294 --> 00:58:38.377
(lighthearted music)

1431
00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:16.198
(lighthearted music continues)

1432
00:59:48.753 --> 00:59:49.586
- Thank you for meeting me.

1433
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:50.419
- Yeah.

1434
00:59:50.419 --> 00:59:51.319
- What's the word?

1435
00:59:51.319 --> 00:59:52.954
- I got all the intel.

1436
00:59:52.954 --> 00:59:54.678
It sounds like in four hours.

1437
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:57.323
a shipment of XZ-9 is
coming over at the pier.

1438
00:59:57.323 --> 01:00:00.934
Wan hired men to escort the shipment.

1439
01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:01.791
- Four hours?

1440
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:02.624
- [Mara] Mm-hmm.

1441
01:00:02.624 --> 01:00:03.457
- That means Wan's gonna be at the pier

1442
01:00:03.457 --> 01:00:06.626
to make sure that shipment
comes in and it comes in right

1443
01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:08.632
but there'll be law reinforcement

1444
01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:10.394
so we should probably
strike in the next hour.

1445
01:00:10.394 --> 01:00:11.227
- If I call it in

1446
01:00:11.227 --> 01:00:12.834
I might be able to get some
backup from the Bureau.

1447
01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:14.276
- Nah.
(Nash laughs)

1448
01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:16.530
Winston called me and offered me a bribe.

1449
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.770
$100.000 plus my sister so.

1450
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.088
I know he's probably
already got a plan set up

1451
01:00:20.088 --> 01:00:21.760
to make it look like I'm the trader.

1452
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.792
- You know this a trap.

1453
01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.000
- I know it's a trap.

1454
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.509
but I got a plan.

1455
01:00:25.509 --> 01:00:28.680
What I need from you are the
blueprints of the warehouse.

1456
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.690
- Okay.

1457
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.314
(keyboard clicks)

1458
01:00:32.314 --> 01:00:33.485
Think I got 'em.

1459
01:00:33.485 --> 01:00:35.017
Even with the shipment coming in later.

1460
01:00:35.017 --> 01:00:37.330
Wan's gonna have at least
half a dozen men there.

1461
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.861
Who's gonna have your back?

1462
01:00:38.861 --> 01:00:40.230
- She will.

1463
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:41.980
- I'll have his back.

1464
01:00:43.157 --> 01:00:44.701
- Mara this is Sylvia Crowell.

1465
01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:46.594
She's in my unit Special Ops.

1466
01:00:46.594 --> 01:00:47.640
Sylvia this is Mara.

1467
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.717
she's my partner with the agency.

1468
01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:51.217
She's a lifesaver.

1469
01:00:52.144 --> 01:00:54.894
- I guess we have that in common.

1470
01:00:55.868 --> 01:00:57.124
- Can you trust her?

1471
01:00:57.124 --> 01:01:00.629
- Yeah.
Just like I can trust you.

1472
01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:01.470
- Brought us some gear.

1473
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.608
(bag thuds)

1474
01:01:03.608 --> 01:01:06.996
Now we can go kill
everyone in that warehouse

1475
01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:09.250
and get your sister back.

1476
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:12.082
I also have this for you.

1477
01:01:12.082 --> 01:01:13.546
- I can't take this.

1478
01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:15.662
If I go in wearing this then
they know something's up.

1479
01:01:15.662 --> 01:01:17.056
(Mara sighs)

1480
01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:20.417
- Well according to the blueprints
there's opening on the
northeast and south side.

1481
01:01:20.417 --> 01:01:21.620
Get you in on the west.

1482
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.894
we can take out anybody
on the other two sides.

1483
01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:27.484
Try and get our offense.

1484
01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:29.836
- That won't work. we can't communicate.

1485
01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:31.234
- I do.

1486
01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:33.295
(zip rattles)

1487
01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:34.212
With these.

1488
01:01:35.434 --> 01:01:38.474
You can track each other's locations.

1489
01:01:38.474 --> 01:01:39.641
our heartbeats

1490
01:01:42.562 --> 01:01:44.081
and we can communicate.

1491
01:01:44.081 --> 01:01:45.871
So let's gear up.

1492
01:01:45.871 --> 01:01:47.367
- [Nash] Good.

1493
01:01:47.367 --> 01:01:50.450
I was hoping you two would get along.

1494
01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:54.893
(dramatic music)

1495
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:00.128
- [Mr. Wan] Winston. Winston.

1496
01:02:06.012 --> 01:02:08.679
Are you playing with this woman?

1497
01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:12.167
How soon will he show his face?

1498
01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:13.500
- Soon. Mr. Wan.

1499
01:02:16.788 --> 01:02:19.482
- I'm gonna check on the shipment.

1500
01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:21.884
You let me know when he get here.

1501
01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:23.112
- Okay.

1502
01:02:23.112 --> 01:02:24.445
- Where's Billy?

1503
01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.175
- Dead.

1504
01:02:27.722 --> 01:02:29.639
- I want in on his cut.

1505
01:02:33.308 --> 01:02:34.141
- Well.

1506
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:39.481
two splits is better than three.

1507
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:42.148
(ominous music)

1508
01:02:46.556 --> 01:02:48.249
(gunshots fire)
(man exclaims)

1509
01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:50.666
(body thuds)

1510
01:02:51.572 --> 01:02:52.655
Who was that?

1511
01:02:53.522 --> 01:02:55.105
- I'll check on it.

1512
01:02:56.076 --> 01:02:57.126
(Brenda exclaims)

1513
01:02:57.126 --> 01:03:00.626
(ominous music continues)

1514
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.404
(gunshots fire)

1515
01:03:09.946 --> 01:03:10.852
- South side clear.

1516
01:03:10.852 --> 01:03:11.932
Sylvia?

1517
01:03:11.932 --> 01:03:13.730
(static cracks)

1518
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:14.563
Sylvia.

1519
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.772
Shit.

1520
01:03:17.772 --> 01:03:19.939
- [Nash] Winston I'm here.

1521
01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:24.505
- Turn around and take off your jacket.

1522
01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.973
- Where's my sister?

1523
01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:31.367
Is she safe?

1524
01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:38.727
- Take the money.

1525
01:03:38.727 --> 01:03:41.199
take your sister and join us.

1526
01:03:41.199 --> 01:03:43.639
What has been a good guy done for you.

1527
01:03:43.639 --> 01:03:46.194
- So I'm just supposed to
let XZ-9 into the world.

1528
01:03:46.194 --> 01:03:48.852
destroy communities.
kill millions of people.

1529
01:03:48.852 --> 01:03:51.255
just so a few of you guys can get rich?

1530
01:03:51.255 --> 01:03:53.738
I've already seen this story
and I don't like how it ends

1531
01:03:53.738 --> 01:03:56.396
'cause I've already lost too
many people including Hubbard.

1532
01:03:56.396 --> 01:03:58.476
- That was the kill plan.

1533
01:03:58.476 --> 01:04:01.831
(ominous music)

1534
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:02.664

(ominous music)

1544
01:04:41.783 --> 01:04:44.616
- It doesn't have to be like this.

1545
01:04:46.579 --> 01:04:48.246
It can be different.

1546
01:04:51.025 --> 01:04:52.358
Just me and you.

1547
01:04:53.697 --> 01:04:55.750
like old times.

1548
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.847
