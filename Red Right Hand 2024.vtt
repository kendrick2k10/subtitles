Doe here is just having
a little bite to eat.

209
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:47.228
Might lose my appetite
looking at that hand though.

This you being funny?

242

Are you really trying to fuck
with my sobriety?

You can throw them back
as good as anyone.

249
00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:03.190

for both of us.

251

[chuckles]

252
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:10.110
Now that... that is a truth
you won't hear on the radio.

253
00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:11.154
See. you missed lunch.

254
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.462
The Buck and Doe
joined us at the diner today.

255
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:18.118
They're under the impression
that you're in Big Cat's debt.

256
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:19.032
That you owe.

257
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.035
Let me tell you something
about this farm. Cash.

Like a bucket with a hole in it.

259
00:14:25.168 --> 00:14:27.344
Did you give the note
on my sister's place to Big Cat?

260
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.350
I took a loan on my place.

[grunts]

262
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.397
I had to. or this farm
would be gone any damn way.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.398
Goddammit!

264
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:43.447
You need a loan.
you go to the bank.

265
00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:45.754
Oh. who do you think
I owe the money to?

266
00:14:45.797 --> 00:14:47.669
You think they just
keep giving you more?

267
00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:49.366
Look. I'm telling you
I did it right.

268
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:51.673
A clear agreement.
I can pay it back

269
00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:53.153
once them cows
are ready for the sale.

270
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.677
It don't matter.
You go through their office.

271
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.766
you sign a bunch
of bullshit paperwork.

272
00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:00.682
That's Big Cat's money
all the same.

273
00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:02.249
Goddammit. use your brain.

274
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:03.511
I'll tell you what.

275
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:05.948
you ain't paid a cent
for that cabin.

276
00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:08.298
That might help fill the hole
a little bit. don't you think?

277
00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:16.263
You gave the devil an inch.
Finn.

278
00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:19.527
What was I supposed to do?

279
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:24.140
You got an extra 100 grand?
No. sir.

280

All right.
so don't worry about it.

281
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:26.751
I'll handle it.

No. I'll handle it.

283

I know how these animals feed.

284
00:15:41.853 --> 00:15:42.985
You need to dry out.

285

Oh. yeah. yeah.

358
00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:56.787
Yeah. I'ma...
I'ma pull it together.

359
00:18:57.223 --> 00:19:00.530
I mean. it ain't even due yet.
so you know. [groans]

360
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:01.662
Leave him alone!

361
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:04.055
It doesn't look like
you're pulling together shit.

362
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:06.145
- Stop!
- Shut that kid up.

363
00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.190
Don't you touch her!

364
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.323
- The Lay off!
- Hey. hey. hey.

365
00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:11.802
Oh. hey. hey. hey. hey.

366
00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:14.588
Damn straight. This here...

367
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:16.285
[grunts]

368
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.505
[screams]

369
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.593
The Get him. boys.

370
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.899
Far as the contract
is concerned.

371
00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:23.553
the farm belongs to Big Cat.

372
00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:26.556
Now maybe you can earn it back.

373
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.732
But it's not the kind of debt
that you can just

374
00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:30.778
walk in and pay.

375
00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:32.780
Even if you had the money.

376
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.219
No. the debt's settled
when Big Cat says it's settled.

377
00:19:37.263 --> 00:19:40.222
Until then. you don't own
the ranch.

378
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:42.920
Now. Cash.
is there anything else

379
00:19:42.964 --> 00:19:44.183
I can do for you?

380
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:47.055
[tense music playing]

381
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.806
- Hey.
- [Savannah sobs]

382
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:02.636
All right. little darling.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

383
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.687
[groans]

384
00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:13.647
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:18.739
[groans]

386
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:23.222
[gasps]

387
00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:34.537
[grunting]

388
00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.106
Buck... Okay. Okay.

389
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:40.282
Look. you shoot me.
ain't nobody getting paid.

390
00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:41.501
It's got nothing
to do with money.

391
00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:44.417
- [gun shots]
- [screams]

392
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:05.873
- [sobs]
- [Finney groans]

393
00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:08.223
What happened?

394
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.530
They put a gun
to his ears and fired.

395
00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:12.401
- Finney?
- I can't hear shit.

396
00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.664
Let's get you inside.
Come on.

397
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:15.926
[grunts]

398
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.146
Come on.

399
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:24.195
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

400
00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:26.197
- - Easy. Just breathe.
- - I'm so sorry.

401
00:21:26.241 --> 00:21:27.286
Just breathe it out.

402
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.417
Oh.

403
00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:29.418
I cut one of 'em.

404
00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:31.246
[music concludes]

405
00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:33.466
Which one?

406
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:35.555
The one that's always giggling.

407
00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:41.909
The Doe.
I'm gonna get this figured out.

408
00:21:44.085 --> 00:21:45.782
I need you to look after
your dad. okay?

409
00:21:47.654 --> 00:21:49.090
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

410
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:54.138
Okay. [groans]

411
00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:56.315
[tense music playing]

412
00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:57.620
desk deputy: Mr. Williams?

413
00:21:58.447 --> 00:21:59.448
Sheriff will see you now.

414
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:07.326
Looky here.

415
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:09.980
Finally turning yourself in.
Cash?

416
00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:12.635
Good to see you too. Duke.

417
00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:13.636
[knocking on door]

418
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:16.683
Cash. come in.

419
00:22:17.074 --> 00:22:18.337
[music concludes]

420
00:22:22.123 --> 00:22:24.604
Always figured I'd have you
sitting in a cell.

421
00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:26.345
Not across from my desk.

422
00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:27.607
What's this about?

423
00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:30.261
I got a Big Cat problem.

424
00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:31.524
[tense music playing]

425
00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:33.177
Now. this ought
to be interesting.

426
00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:35.702
Well. Finney went to her
for a loan on the farm

427
00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:36.920
and she's tightening the screws.

428
00:22:37.617 --> 00:22:39.532
Seems anyone should know better.
it's him.

429
00:22:40.446 --> 00:22:42.012
Oh. come on. Sheriff.

430
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:45.625
I mean. she's the damn queen
of Odim County. [chuckles]

431
00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:49.106
That's something you sure
as hell had a hand in. Cash.

432
00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:50.543
Mm.

433
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:52.893
So if you wanna talk
about that. we're all ears.

434
00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:55.809
As far as the loan.
I'd say you talk to Zeke.

435
00:22:56.113 --> 00:22:56.984
Yeah.

436
00:22:58.159 --> 00:23:00.770
Yeah. Well. did that.

437
00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:04.948
Look. we wanna take her down
just as bad as you do.

438
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:07.864
But we need proof of wrongdoing.
not just accusations.

439
00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:09.692
So how about it. Cash?

440
00:23:10.084 --> 00:23:11.302
You got some information?

441
00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:15.481
If you did. it could solve a lot
of problems for both of us.

442
00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:21.791
I'm just trying to hold on
to my sister's place.

443
00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:24.620
Then bring me something concrete
I can take to a judge.

444
00:23:32.498 --> 00:23:34.238
[music concludes]

445
00:23:36.023 --> 00:23:40.157
[tense music playing]

446
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:10.884
[barking]

447
00:24:19.545 --> 00:24:20.981
Hang my daddy's gun.

448
00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:25.202
Here. Here.
[snaps fingers twice]

449
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.574
Lazarus. you're gonna have
to excuse me.

450
00:24:48.617 --> 00:24:50.184
I really like your ideas.

451
00:24:50.227 --> 00:24:51.707
but I'm gonna have
to ponder them.

452
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:53.927
Yeah. yeah. no problem.

453
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.971
[sighs]

454
00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:56.016
What's up. man?

455
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:02.892
Cash.

456
00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:14.034
Wanna tell me why you're putting
the screws on me and my family?

457
00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:17.037
Having your men put their hands
on a little girl?

458
00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:18.908
You're upset.

459
00:25:20.214 --> 00:25:23.522
Shot Finney's ears out
in front of Savannah.

460
00:25:25.132 --> 00:25:26.829
Big His ears
will be ringing for a few days.

461
00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:27.743
no doubt about that.

462
00:25:28.352 --> 00:25:30.224
But the message was for you.
Cash.

463
00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:32.487
You missed it before.

464
00:25:33.749 --> 00:25:35.969
When I have to send a message
a second time.

465
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:37.448
it comes with more volume.

466
00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:41.540
I don't want your cows
or your land.

467
00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:45.631
Hell. I didn't wanna give Finney
a loan in the first damn place.

468
00:25:45.674 --> 00:25:46.719
because I knew

469
00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:49.112
the drunken son of a bitch
would piss it away.

470
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:54.291
So here I am
doing the honorable thing.

471
00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.555
giving you the opportunity
to work it off.

472
00:25:57.381 --> 00:26:01.255
so I don't have to put Finney
in a hole

473
00:26:01.298 --> 00:26:03.257
next to your sister. Rachel.

474
00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:05.433
I'm out.

475
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.478
We had an agreement.

476
00:26:09.437 --> 00:26:11.004
I've grown since you left.

477
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:15.182
It's no longer just
plants and pills.

478
00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:20.840
I'm into empire-building. Cash.

479
00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:25.192
I got my fingers and hands
in everything.

480
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:28.674
[tense music playing]

481
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:33.896
It's a delicate time
in my enterprise.

482
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:36.638
We're on the verge
of something big.

483
00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:41.861
And I could use an extra hand.

484
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:45.168
Now. I got good. strong boys.

485
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:47.693
raised on my rules
and dedicated. every one of 'em.

486
00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:50.347
but they don't have your gifts.

487
00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:54.569
You were always so good
with people.

488
00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:58.834
But then you could be
a cold-hearted son of a bitch

489
00:26:58.878 --> 00:26:59.835
just as easy.

490
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.666
That's what made you so good.

491
00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.973
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to consider.

492
00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:09.802
unless you give me
some specifics.

493
00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:13.675
Three jobs of my choosing.

494
00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:15.634
That's what it'll take
to pay back the debt.

495
00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:17.810
If I decline?

496
00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:20.726
You can take the silver
or you can take the lead.

497
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:27.863
I do this.
it's to pay off a debt.

498
00:27:30.518 --> 00:27:31.998
Three jobs and I'm done.

499
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.390
[music concludes]

500
00:27:34.391 --> 00:27:35.654
Simple and plain.

501
00:27:36.176 --> 00:27:37.264
Of course. baby.

502
00:27:38.352 --> 00:27:40.963
No need to be complicated.

503
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:45.185
[tense music playing]

504
00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:09.862
[sighs]

505
00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:19.393
How you doing?

506
00:28:20.307 --> 00:28:21.395
Worst goddamn thing

507
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:22.788
that happened
in front of Savannah.

508
00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:24.920
I don't disagree.

509
00:28:28.402 --> 00:28:30.491
Grown man. can't take care
of my own land.

510
00:28:30.534 --> 00:28:32.841
Couldn't take care of my wife.
Now. my little girl.

511
00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:38.847
You're not the only one twisting
yourself up about things.

512
00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:42.851
No. Maybe I just wasn't cut out
to be a father.

513
00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.113
Hm.

514
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:46.725
You gotta quit
talking like that.

515
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:50.076
That's not helping anyone.

516
00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.991
- I know.
- Especially Savannah.

517
00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:54.558
[sobs]
I'm just tired of thinking.

518
00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:58.432
I'm tired of feeling.

519
00:29:00.303 --> 00:29:01.565
Tired of drinking.

520
00:29:02.697 --> 00:29:03.829
Being hungover.

521
00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:09.922
I'm so tired of drinking.

522
00:29:12.054 --> 00:29:14.622
[sobs]

523
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.407
It's not gonna be easy
drawing off.

524
00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:23.587
But I'll be there for you
every way I can.

525
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.075
[grunts]

526
00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:37.732
- How much trouble are we in?
- [sighs sharply]

527
00:29:39.429 --> 00:29:40.387
What can I do?

528
00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:43.999
Keep reading. Keep studying.

529
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:47.568
So you don't make
the same mistakes we have.

530
00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:49.788
Don't talk to me like
I don't understand.

531
00:29:51.877 --> 00:29:52.747
I know you do.

532
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.315
I can help.

533
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.012
I know you can.

Don't sell it short.

706

What was it that drew you out?

707
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:31.907
It's nothing quite so dramatic.

708
00:40:33.169 --> 00:40:35.345
I had a revelation.
Pure and simple.

709
00:40:37.043 --> 00:40:40.873
My eyes were opened like Saul
on the road to Damascus.

710
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.050
Yeah. that's pretty dramatic
to me.

711

Hell. we got the scars
to prove it.

713
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.666

00:40:53.102 --> 00:40:57.759
[cell phone vibrating]

715
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:05.201
Yeah?

716
00:41:09.815 --> 00:41:10.816
Okay.

717
00:41:11.817 --> 00:41:12.992
No. I'll handle it.

718
00:41:14.602 --> 00:41:15.777
Okay.

719
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:18.127
[tense music playing]

720
00:41:26.266 --> 00:41:27.223
What's the word?

721
00:41:29.312 --> 00:41:30.400
Lazarus.

722
00:41:32.794 --> 00:41:33.665
His number's up.

723
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:36.581
Why's that?

724
00:41:37.146 --> 00:41:38.974
Got some side hustle going.
Big Cat don't approve.

725
00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:40.498
She wants an example made.

726
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:45.154
So. he'll be coming with us.
but he's not coming back.

727
00:41:47.243 --> 00:41:48.549
That's a pretty big change
of plans

728
00:41:48.593 --> 00:41:50.072
to be dropping last minute.

729
00:41:50.116 --> 00:41:51.465
It's fucked. man.

730
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:53.249
He's been working
this deal for months.

731
00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:55.774
Could open up a whole lane
of East Coast distribution.

732
00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:58.167
[sighs]

733
00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:02.215
But you know Big Cat.
She makes the decision.

734
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:03.825
You gonna be able
to handle this?

735
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:08.395
Yeah. Easy. no question.

736
00:42:08.438 --> 00:42:11.267
Just make it clean.
Nothing fancy.

737
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:14.053
I got it. Jesus.

738
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:16.838
[laughs]

739
00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:17.970
Oh. boy.

740
00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:20.189
Just about jumped out
of your damn skin.

741
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:21.626
Yeah. thanks. asshole.

742
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:23.366
All right. my brothers.

743
00:42:24.672 --> 00:42:26.761
How's about a little 'cid
for this trip? Huh?

744
00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:28.154
That's how you wanna go
into this?

745
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:30.025
Well. I do my best work
on a tab.

746
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.244
Two tabs. that's too much.

747
00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:32.767
That's over the top.
Ain't that right. Wes?

748
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:34.377
Come on. man.
Stop messing around.

749
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:37.076
Goddamn. man.
y'all need to relax.

750
00:42:37.642 --> 00:42:39.252
These dudes. they like me.

751
00:42:39.295 --> 00:42:42.255
They're gonna get spooked by all
your fucking stressor vibes.

752
00:42:43.778 --> 00:42:45.345
All right. let's roll. baby.

753
00:42:45.954 --> 00:42:47.434
Time to become legends. boys.

754
00:42:47.477 --> 00:42:48.914
[tires screeching]

755
00:42:49.262 --> 00:42:53.222
[foreboding music playing]

756
00:43:01.187 --> 00:43:03.145
Now make a left there.
cross that bridge.

757
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:12.894
[sighs]

758
00:43:13.503 --> 00:43:14.679
You wanna give us
a hand here. Wes?

759
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.117
Or you gonna keep pacing
a hole in the ground?

760
00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:20.598
[grunts]

761
00:43:22.469 --> 00:43:23.644
What's the deal. man?

762
00:43:23.688 --> 00:43:25.603
You've been acting fucking weird
all day.

763
00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:27.256
You run out of Percocet
or something?

764
00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:31.609
- Wha...
- [gunshots]

765
00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:33.915
[music concludes]

[tense music playing]

767
00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:39.181
The fuck did you just do?

768
00:43:39.225 --> 00:43:40.226
He knew something was up.

769
00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:41.923
The only thing he knew

770
00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:43.882
is you were acting
like a goddamn jackass.

771
00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:45.753
You said do it clean.
I did it clean.

772
00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:48.974
After. Do it clean after.

773
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:51.193
It's his deal. isn't it?

774
00:43:51.977 --> 00:43:53.021
His contact.

775
00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:54.283
Shit.

776
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:55.633
Yeah. shit.

777
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:01.813
Help me get him
in the goddamn van.

778
00:44:05.251 --> 00:44:06.687
Wanna get off the tarp?

779
00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:11.910
Are you gonna help me get him
in the van?

780
00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:13.868
I think I'm gonna fucking puke.

781
00:44:14.347 --> 00:44:15.609
[cell phone chimes]

782
00:44:17.306 --> 00:44:18.351
Just get the phone.

783
00:44:23.617 --> 00:44:24.923
It's them. Shit.

784
00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:27.012
They're 15 minutes out.

785
00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:29.579
Write back. tell 'em

786
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:31.669
he can't make it.
but his boys will be there.

787
00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:34.715
It's fucking locked. I can't...

788
00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:39.851
Here. channel your best Lazarus.

789
00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:41.766
Right. Okay.

790
00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:50.296
[tense music playing]

791
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.733
What happens if they ask
about Lazarus?

792
00:44:53.778 --> 00:44:58.130
When they ask.
you let me handle it.

793
00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:01.046
Stay cool and get the deal done.
Can you do that?

794
00:45:01.089 --> 00:45:02.047
Yeah.

795
00:45:02.743 --> 00:45:04.353
All right.
here they fucking come.

796
00:45:10.882 --> 00:45:12.057
[car door opening]

797
00:45:33.687 --> 00:45:35.123
Everybody has their thing.

798
00:45:36.908 --> 00:45:39.867
For me. it's one specific one.

799
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:45.786
My men know what it is
and they avoid it at all costs

800
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.702
just to not set me off.

801
00:45:50.095 --> 00:45:52.967
He doesn't like surprises.

802
00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:59.582
So. you can imagine
my gut feeling...

803
00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:02.368
when I get a text...

804
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.633
10 minutes
before our scheduled meeting...

805
00:46:07.852 --> 00:46:10.158
informing me
that I'll be encountering...

806
00:46:11.725 --> 00:46:14.554
two faces I do not know.

807
00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:17.600
Instead of the one
that I was expecting.

808
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:19.820
Lazarus.

809
00:46:23.302 --> 00:46:24.694
So I ask you...

810
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:30.788
where is sweet.

811
00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:33.181
fun-time Lazarus?

812
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.229
And why the fuck isn't he here?

813
00:46:37.838 --> 00:46:39.535
- Look. there must be some...
- He couldn't make it.

814
00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:41.668
We're here to handle it for him.

815
00:46:42.538 --> 00:46:43.801
It's no more complicated
than that.

816
00:46:44.976 --> 00:46:46.978
What did Lazarus say
in his text?

817
00:46:52.374 --> 00:46:53.288
"LOL."

818
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:55.900
"I'm totally blown out
right now."

819
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:58.816
"My guys will be there
to cover me."

820
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:02.167
See. I know Lazarus.

821
00:47:03.516 --> 00:47:04.865
Boy likes to have fun.

822
00:47:06.345 --> 00:47:08.564
That's why he's so pleasant
to be around.

823
00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:12.917
But this...
this is out of character.

824
00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:14.919
We're all a little annoyed
and surprised

825
00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:16.007
he couldn't make it.

826
00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:19.662
But if you knew Lazarus
like we do. well...

827
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:23.057
it's not so out of character
for Mr. Fun-Time.

828
00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:25.233
[chuckles]

829
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:32.545
[tense music playing]

830
00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:36.244
Nobody move. or I put you down.

831
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:37.855
Don't you do it.

832
00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:39.987
Well. this is a major surprise.

833
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:41.902
There's an explanation.

834
00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:44.252
but I'm not in a position
to give it.

835
00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:47.647
Now. I'm gonna assume
that nobody wants to die

836
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:48.953
on this fine afternoon.

837
00:47:49.518 --> 00:47:51.259
And we sure as shit
don't wanna tell Big Cat

838
00:47:51.303 --> 00:47:53.044
why this turned
into a bloodbath.

839
00:47:54.654 --> 00:47:56.221
So let's stay focused
on the matter at hand.

840
00:47:56.264 --> 00:47:57.222
Can we do that?

841
00:48:00.573 --> 00:48:01.791
If you can't play nice.

842
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.490
I'll take you
out of the equation.

843
00:48:04.533 --> 00:48:05.534
Understood?

844
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.148
Yeah. I understand.

845
00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:14.065
Your product's all there.

846
00:48:16.937 --> 00:48:17.895
We good?

847
00:48:19.722 --> 00:48:21.028
Get the money.

848
00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:22.900
[gun shots]

849
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.255
man: Wayne!

850
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:33.693
Wayne!

851
00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:35.782
All right. kid. let's slow down.

852
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:38.089
We can still work this out.

853
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.743
Wayne? You hear me. Wayne?

854
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:45.400
You motherfuckers!

855
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.360
Would you stop shooting

856
00:48:48.882 --> 00:48:51.189
and just listen
to what I have to say?

857
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:52.668
Fuck you!

858
00:48:53.147 --> 00:48:54.235
Fuck you!

859
00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:56.934
We fired in self-defense.

860
00:48:57.673 --> 00:48:59.066
You know that's true.

861
00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.895
I need you to be smarter
than this.

862
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:06.465
Shit.

[groans]

865
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:20.958
Nope. drop it.

866
00:49:21.915 --> 00:49:24.004
Do it now
or I'll shoot you in the face.

867
00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:26.528
This can play out one
of two ways.

868
00:49:27.268 --> 00:49:28.182
I can kill you

869
00:49:28.574 --> 00:49:29.792
and take the money and drugs
back to Big Cat

870
00:49:29.836 --> 00:49:31.098
and roll the dice
on a busted deal.

871
00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:33.666
Or. and this is
my personal favorite.

872
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.147
you take the drugs.
we take the money.

873
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.975
just like we planned.
you go on living.

874
00:49:38.366 --> 00:49:40.194
we go on living.
What do you say?

875
00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:43.981
Smart kid.

876
00:49:44.372 --> 00:49:45.634
Come here.

Okay.

880
00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:03.652
Actually could have gone
a lot worse.

881
00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:25.892
Get the bag.

00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:39.166
Do I even wanna know
what that is?

885
00:50:40.298 --> 00:50:41.212
No.

886
00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:45.390
You're in the back.

887
00:50:45.825 --> 00:50:47.305
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

888
00:50:47.348 --> 00:50:49.307
Get in there
and babysit your handiwork.

889
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:07.760
- You all right?
- All right.

890

[music concludes]

891
00:51:13.113 --> 00:51:14.984
So. three jobs. huh?

892
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:19.250
It settles us up.

893
00:51:20.381 --> 00:51:21.513
That was number two.

894
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:25.517
That don't sit well with me.
Not one bit.

895
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.474
Yeah.

896
00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:28.128
Well. it's not fitting too well
with me either.

897
00:51:28.172 --> 00:51:31.088
so if you got any ideas.
I'm all ears. [sighs]

898
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:34.830
There she is.

899
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:36.658
Hey. honey. how was school?

900
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:37.790
Good. I guess.

901
00:51:39.748 --> 00:51:40.749
Everything all right?

902
00:51:42.142 --> 00:51:44.101
Another day. [chuckles]

903
00:51:44.623 --> 00:51:45.667
Tip top.

904
00:51:46.755 --> 00:51:48.148
I'm gonna go inside.
so you can finish

905
00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:50.237
whatever it is
you don't want me to hear.

906
00:51:50.281 --> 00:51:51.282
I appreciate it. honey.

907
00:51:51.804 --> 00:51:53.153
- Be in there in a minute.
- Great.

908
00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:00.639
What if Big Cat
don't stick to her word?

909
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:04.033
That's why I got a backup plan.

910
00:52:04.295 --> 00:52:08.168
[dramatic music playing]

911
00:52:15.871 --> 00:52:17.438
[music fades]

912
00:52:17.482 --> 00:52:19.223
There a reason
you came ready for war?

913
00:52:20.006 --> 00:52:22.574
Is there a reason you invited me
out to the middle of nowhere?

914
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:25.316
I wanna give you Big Cat.

915
00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:26.317
Oh. yeah?

916
00:52:27.274 --> 00:52:28.580
How you gonna do that. Cash?

917
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:31.191
She's got labs
all over these hills.

918
00:52:31.235 --> 00:52:32.453
all producing.

919
00:52:32.497 --> 00:52:36.109
She's trading trucks
full of drugs for cash.

920
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.458
That's just for starters.

921
00:52:39.504 --> 00:52:41.332
That sound
like a mighty good story.

922
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:44.378
But I'm gonna need more
than a story.

923
00:52:45.074 --> 00:52:47.207
I need something
that's gonna tie her directly

924
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:49.427
to everything that's happening.
Can you give me that?

925
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:51.037
You tell me what you want.
I'll get it.

926
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:53.648
But I don't exist not
to anybody.

927
00:52:53.692 --> 00:52:55.128
It gets out I'm feeding you...

928
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.825
[tense music playing]

929
00:52:57.086 --> 00:52:59.828
...Big Cat roasts my family
on a spit. you understand?

930
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:01.700
I get it.

931
00:53:03.092 --> 00:53:04.746
I understand what you need

932
00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:07.662
and what it means
to take care of your family.

933
00:53:08.837 --> 00:53:10.796
I got you on that.
I give you my word.

934
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.060
I could call my buddy down
at the DA.

935
00:53:14.103 --> 00:53:16.280
we get into it and see
what we need for a conviction.

936
00:53:16.323 --> 00:53:18.804
but I need you to not fuck me
on this. Cash.

937
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:22.851
I want her gone.

938
00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:29.423
Me too.

939
00:53:32.121 --> 00:53:32.992
Good.

940
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:38.040
Pick a better meeting spot
next time.

941
00:53:39.085 --> 00:53:40.042
[gunshot]

942
00:53:40.521 --> 00:53:41.740
Bottom right corner.

943
00:53:43.481 --> 00:53:44.960
Breathe. relax.

944
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.922
- [gunshots]
- Bottom left corner.

945
00:53:49.965 --> 00:53:52.316
All right. snug
in your shoulder. loose hands.

946
00:53:53.534 --> 00:53:56.755
I can be snug or looser.
I can't do both.

947
00:53:57.146 --> 00:54:00.237
Well. pull it in with your arms.
not your hands.

948
00:54:00.846 --> 00:54:02.500
Slow it all down. Savannah.

949
00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:04.589
It's not about speed.
it's process.

950
00:54:05.503 --> 00:54:09.550
See it. say the word.
squeeze that trigger.

951
00:54:09.594 --> 00:54:10.638
you know what to do.

952
00:54:11.683 --> 00:54:13.032
[inhales deeply]

953
00:54:13.337 --> 00:54:14.773
[exhales] For God.

954
00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.298
[inhales deeply]

955
00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:19.299
[exhales] Family.

- Survival.
- [gunshot]

958
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:28.569
All right. second ring. good.

959
00:54:28.613 --> 00:54:30.005
Team effort. there you go.

960
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.311
Oh.

961
00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:32.269
Oh. are we done?

962
00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:35.315
- Heck no!
- That's what I'm talking about.

963
00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:40.799
[police radio chatter]

964
00:54:40.842 --> 00:54:42.583
- [knocking on roof]
- [chuckles shakily]

965
00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:44.716
Your license and registration.
please.

966
00:54:45.934 --> 00:54:49.808
[tense music playing]

967
00:54:51.462 --> 00:54:52.419
There you go.

968
00:54:54.465 --> 00:54:55.596
What's that about?

969
00:54:56.118 --> 00:54:58.033
That's gratitude. officer.

970
00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:00.035
It's courtesy
from our first lady

971
00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:01.341
of Odim County.

972
00:55:01.776 --> 00:55:04.039
- It's for you.
- What's that. about 100 bucks?

973
00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:04.953
Yes.

974
00:55:05.737 --> 00:55:07.304
Now. that's a handsome sum.
right there.

975
00:55:07.347 --> 00:55:09.044
[chuckles] Yeah.

976
00:55:09.088 --> 00:55:10.307
I'm gonna let you hold on to it.

977
00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:15.703
Oh. you're all right. officer.
thank you.

978
00:55:16.095 --> 00:55:17.444
I want you to step out
of the car.

979
00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:20.969
Are you sure about that?

980
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.407
- One hundred percent.
- I don't think

981
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:25.931
that's in your best interest.
officer. I... I don't. I...

982
00:55:25.974 --> 00:55:27.585
Well. I want you to step out
of the car.

983
00:55:27.628 --> 00:55:31.197
I want you to pop the trunk.
so I can do a nice inventory

984
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.678
search of the old girl.
I'm gonna go bumper to bumper.

985
00:55:34.287 --> 00:55:35.941
Yeah. I'm... No.

986
00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:39.510
Woah! Let it fucking go!

987
00:55:39.553 --> 00:55:41.207
- [Tammy screams]
- Get out the fucking car!

988
00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:44.253
[screams]

989
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:46.038
It'll be all right.

990
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:47.605
- Give me your fucking arm!
- [screams]

991
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.955
Oh. yeah. you fucked up today.

992
00:55:51.043 --> 00:55:52.218
Oh. yeah.

993
00:55:53.088 --> 00:55:55.308
Now you get to think
about what you just tried to do.

994
00:55:57.266 --> 00:55:59.530
Fuck! Fuck you!

995
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:02.620
[sobs] Fuck!

996
00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:04.361
Goddamn.

997
00:56:04.404 --> 00:56:06.275
You just fucked up big-time!

998
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:09.191
Oh. yeah. you got plenty of time
to think about this.

999
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:11.498
I got one of Big Cat's
fucking mules

1000
00:56:11.542 --> 00:56:13.282
- on the side of the road.
- [music concludes]

1001
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:17.504
Cash. it's Duke.
Man. pick up when I'm calling.

1002
00:56:17.548 --> 00:56:18.766
I'm trying
to get a hold of you.

1003
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:22.466
I talked to my guy at the DA
and he says if you can give us

1004
00:56:22.509 --> 00:56:24.119
these drug labs on a map.

1005
00:56:24.163 --> 00:56:25.991
we may be able
to put this thing together.

1006
00:56:26.687 --> 00:56:28.123
I'm gonna need you
to wear a wire.

1007
00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:30.038
You can't hide under a rock
on this one.

1008
00:56:30.604 --> 00:56:32.258
Call me back. Clock ticking.

1009
00:56:32.301 --> 00:56:33.651
[horn honking]

1010
00:56:43.356 --> 00:56:45.750
Time to go. Cash.
Get in the car.

1011
00:56:45.793 --> 00:56:46.838
Where we going?

1012
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:50.972
Don't worry about that.
You just get in the car.

1013
00:56:51.233 --> 00:56:52.670
I don't get in the car with you.

1014
00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.848
- Why not?
- I don't like you.

1015
00:56:58.066 --> 00:56:59.416
Because I think
you're an asshole.

1016
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.592
[giggles]

1017
00:57:01.635 --> 00:57:03.376
Well. we don't think much
of you. either.

1018
00:57:04.072 --> 00:57:05.509
So I guess we'll just have
to risk it.

1019
00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:22.743
Heard there was a real
clusterfuck in the woods. huh?

1020
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:24.745

Oh! Oh. you're late!
Come on. boys.

1024
00:57:53.513 --> 00:57:55.384
Big Cat wants everyone
around the table.

1025
00:57:56.429 --> 00:57:58.475
- - Zeke.
- - Cash.

[indistinct chatter]

1027
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.528
Quiet down.

[indistinct chatter]

1029
00:58:10.095 --> 00:58:12.663
I said quiet down.
I got something to say.

1030
00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:15.274
I want you to know...

1031
00:58:17.276 --> 00:58:18.451
that we are growing.

1032
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.409
- [henchmen cheer]
- [tense music playing]

1033
00:58:20.975 --> 00:58:23.325
And with that.
I wanna draw your attention

1034
00:58:23.369 --> 00:58:24.675
to my son Zeke.

1035
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:31.159
You did things for my business
that I never knew possible.

1036
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.987
[chuckles]

1037
00:58:33.597 --> 00:58:36.730
So I want it noted. in front
of all these reprobates...

1038
00:58:36.774 --> 00:58:38.384
[henchmen laugh]

1039
00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:43.258
...that I love you
and I appreciate you.

1040
00:58:44.738 --> 00:58:46.087
I love you. Mom.

1041
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:51.745
To my baby boy. Zeke.

1042
00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:54.748
- all: Zeke.
- [Big Cat laughs]

1043
00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:58.752
And now to this pouty-faced
son of a bitch...

1044
00:58:58.796 --> 00:59:00.580
- [henchmen laughing]
- ...Cash.

1045
00:59:01.668 --> 00:59:05.193
Worked for me back in the day.
Things didn't go so well.

1046
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:09.154
It got kind of ugly.

1047
00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:11.243
But I don't blame you. Cash.

1048
00:59:11.286 --> 00:59:14.420
I know
I can be a nasty old bitch.

1049
00:59:14.463 --> 00:59:17.118
[henchmen laughing]

1050
00:59:17.684 --> 00:59:20.165
But I thought I'd give you
another chance to do

1051
00:59:20.774 --> 00:59:21.775
right by these hills.

1052
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.344
And boy. did you. Hm?

1053
00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:29.740
You salvaged a deal
that in anyone else's hands

1054
00:59:29.783 --> 00:59:32.046
would have been a goat fuck.

1055
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.439
[henchmen laugh]

1056
00:59:33.482 --> 00:59:37.051
Big But you delivered
like you always did.

1057
00:59:37.922 --> 00:59:40.664
I got big plans for you.

1058
00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:43.449
I got big plans for all of you.

[henchmen cheering]

1060
00:59:46.147 --> 00:59:48.323
I'm talking greenback dollars.

1061
00:59:48.367 --> 00:59:50.325
- men: Yeah!
- Big Truckloads

1062
00:59:50.369 --> 00:59:52.414

of greenback dollars.

which of these goes where?

1161
01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:16.869

you need to get used
to a little blood.

1176
01:06:18.931 --> 01:06:21.020
Isn't that right. Cash? Eh?

1177

your beautiful faces.

1246
01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:24.758
Today. I...

1247
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:28.284
I think...

1248
01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:30.111
[clears throat]

1249
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:34.290
I think today I'm gonna deviate
from my planned remarks...

1250
01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:36.901
to speak to you from the heart.

1251
01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:42.210
We tend to focus on those sins
that bring tangible things

into our lives.
whether it's greed...

1253

lust. pride.

1254
01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:51.002
Something we don't think
about much

1255
01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:52.917
is ridding our lives
of those sins

1256
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.571
that have no worldly benefit.

1257
01:11:56.224 --> 01:12:00.490
like guilt. self-loathing.
anger at God.

1258
01:12:00.533 --> 01:12:01.882
or anger at ourselves.

1259
01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:04.015
These are the things
that weigh us down

1260
01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:05.582
and distract us
from what's important.

1261
01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:06.974
[whispers]
Honey. I think I gotta step out.

1262
01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:08.411
God doesn't want you
carrying the weight

1263
01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:09.890
- of your sin.
- I'll come with you.

1264
01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:11.152
He wants you to be present...

1265
01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:12.284
I'll be back.

1266
01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.459
...with those
who are with you now.

1267
01:12:14.547 --> 01:12:16.462
Dedicate yourself to them.

1268
01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:20.684
Let them be the benefactors
of your love and labor.

Hey.

1274

You okay?

1275
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.405
I am so sorry. Savannah.

1276
01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.841
It's okay.

1277
01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:51.192
I'm sorry I haven't been
a better dad to you.

It's just been tough.

1281

But I promise I'm gonna
be a better dad to you.

1282
01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:03.901
I love you.

1283

Come here. [sobs]

1284
01:13:08.732 --> 01:13:10.603
I think Mom would just want us
to be okay.

1285

That she would.
[sniffles]

1286

Apologies. Finn.

1287
01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.220
I've been sitting
on that one for a while.

1288
01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:20.961
Might have got
a little overanxious.

1289
01:13:21.005 --> 01:13:22.006
Oh. thank you.

1290
01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:24.878
Oh. I thought it was beautiful.

- Hmm. It's good to see you.
- And you.

1292
01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:31.624
Maybe this means
you'll be coming around

a little more often.

1294
01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:34.627

I don't know.

1296
01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:40.111

of mine right now.

Where are the police?
We have to tell them who did it.

1383
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:37.713
They already know.

1384
01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:40.803
Then why don't they do
something?

1385
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.416
Because these people make
everybody afraid.

I'm done letting her take
from this family.

Pray with me.

1393
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:20.930
Pray with me now.

1394
01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:30.591
I don't think God's gonna
like what I have to say.

1395
01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:31.984
Just try.

when you pray.

1399
01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:44.518
you took Rachel.
and now you've taken Finney.

1400
01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:46.042
And I got to be honest...

1401
01:19:47.434 --> 01:19:49.262
I just don't see a plan here.

1402
01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:55.399
I don't see how a loving God
could take my family

1403
01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:58.794
and leave that little girl
with no mom and dad.

1404
01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.187
It don't make no sense.

1405
01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:03.799
In fact. as long
as we're being honest here.

1406
01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:06.062
I wonder if you're there at all.
if you've abandoned us all

1407
01:20:06.105 --> 01:20:08.151
in this hell to suffer.

1408
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.549
Wilder tells me you are there.

1409
01:20:17.682 --> 01:20:19.771
And that you test your servants.

1410
01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:21.468
Hmm.

1411
01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:25.516
And that this is my burden.

1412
01:20:28.736 --> 01:20:30.477
So I'm gonna do
what feels right.

1413
01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:35.308
And I'm gonna trust that.
because my blood is on fire.

1414
01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:39.530
But I ask you. Father.

1415
01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:43.316
I ask that you protect

1416
01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.799
what's left of my family
while I go about this.

1417
01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:52.673
I ask that you give me
the courage.

1418
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.850
and the strength. and resolve...

1419
01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.683
to kill these bastards.
