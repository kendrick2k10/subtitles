00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:03.104
BASED ON ACTUAL INVESTIGATIONS

4
00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.693
How long have you been studying
this kind of phenomenon?

5
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.864
Twenty years... maybe more.

6
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.621
How did you manage.
through all this years.

7
00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:24.751
to balance your personal life
with your work?

8
00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.754
I assume you have a wife
and a family.

9
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.256
Don't assume.

10
00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.092
I don't.

11
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.050
Can you assure me
that the video is authentic?

12
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.101
It is.

13
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.443
Professor Rocha.
tell us everything you know.

14
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.487
Of course.

15
00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.866
Tell me. Miss...

16
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.121
Do you believe we're alone
in the universe?

17
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:12.132
THE FINAL PHASE

18
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:48.209
Hi daughter. I need to speak to you
urgently. Please call me.

19
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.869
- What a day. uh?
- Yes. love.

20
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.748
- But the new hotel project is ours.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.711
- Back pain?
- A strong one.

22
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.090
No. wait. wait...
Just leave it.

23
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.759
Relax...

24
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.597
- Just relax. You're all knotted up.
- Yeah.

25
00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.474
You can do that later.

26
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.228
It feels so good.

27
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.731
I'm all better now.

28
00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.489
How about...

29
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.076
we take a bath together...

30
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.995
followed by more massages?

31
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.580
I like the idea.

32
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.208
And I like you.

33
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.878
So. so much.

34
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.224
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just tired.

35
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.601
I'll be waiting. okay?

36
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.981
- I'll get everything ready.
- Sure. I'll go in a sec.

37
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.818
You're sweet.

38
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.253
Hi daughter. I need to speak to you
urgently. Please call me.

39
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.724
Hello?

40
00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.977
Who is it?
Can I speak to Gonzalo?

41
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.687
Laura Pereira?

42
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.730
Yes. Who is it?

43
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.236
Sorry for the delay.

44
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.488
I was at your father's house.

45
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.115
What happened?
Why can't we go there?

46
00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:26.743
The place was completely messed up.

47
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.371
It seems somebody broke in
looking for something.

48
00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:37.253
Right now. the forensic police
is examining the whole place.

49
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.256
So we'd rather not have any disturbances
in our investigations.

50
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.508
What do you know. detective?

51
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.386
Not much for now.

52
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:51.351
A neighbor heard some noises
coming from the house and called us.

53
00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.979
When we got there.
we found all this.

54
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.315
Did the neighbor saw something?

55
00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.442
She saw a man.

56
00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.612
He was lurking around the house.
but...

57
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.214
that's all.

58
00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:05.698
Do you think he was kidnapped?

59
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.826
We're not ruling out any possibility.

60
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.374
Your father's an architect. right?

61
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.376
Yeah. Like me.

62
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:22.131
Do you know if he was working
on any special project?

63
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.592
No. he retired some years ago.

64
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.261
He walked away from everything
related to his profession.

65
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.388
And...

66
00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:35.228
was he into any hobby. activity.
anything he liked doing?

67
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.564
He investigated
certain kind of phenomenon.

68
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.607
What phenomenon?

69
00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:46.364
- UFOs.
- UFOs?

70
00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:51.494
Why was he so interested in UFOs?

71
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.620
It's a long story.

72
00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:06.968
- How's your relationship with him?
- We grew apart.

73
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.262
May I ask why?

74
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.977
He changed a lot after my mom's death.
so I just decided to keep some distance.

75
00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.104
I see.

76
00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:25.987
And how would you describe
your father's mental state?

77
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.239
I don't know.

78
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:33.202
Do you think he could have faked
his own disappearance?

79
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.371
It wouldn't surprise me.

80
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.373
When are we going to know something?

81
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:41.878
I'll get in touch with you
as soon as I know anything.

82
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.840
Rest assure...

83
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.093
we're doing our utmost to find him.

84
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.012
I'll give you my card.

85
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.975
If you need anything. call me.

86
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.853
Thank you. detective.

87
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.122
This seems to be endless.

88
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.834
Relax. It's just another one
of Gonzalo's lunacies.

89
00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.628
Yeah. but when is he going to stop?

90
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.507
I thought I'd be free of all this
when I distanced myself.

91
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.592
See. it's impossible.

92
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.138
People don't change.
You should know him by now.

93
00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:35.723
Precisely.

94
00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:39.060
When everything is perfect.
he shows up and ruins it.

95
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:45.066
Everything's gonna be okay.
Relax.

96
00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.341
Dad?

97
00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.594
They're watching us.

98
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.514
They're always watching us.

99
00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.474
Who?

100
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.980
They... are waiting.

101
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:07.356
Waiting for what?

102
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.445
The messenger...

103
00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.492
They're coming.

104
00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:37.011
Whoever broke in. didn't leave
any trace or fingerprint.

105
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:39.138
What do you think happened to him?

106
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.479
Judging by the circumstances.

107
00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:50.733
if this is a kidnapping.
we're dealing with a professional.

108
00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:54.445
However. if that's the case.

109
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.866
we're waiting for them to contact us.
and you.

110
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.118
to know what their intentions are.

111
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.333
We'll keep investigating.

112
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.461
but keep in mind
this can take some time.

113
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:11.879
I see.

114
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.810
Laura...

115
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.847
any information you can give me.

116
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.059
would be really helpful
for the investigation.

117
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.060
I know. it's just...

118
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.732
my father became a total stranger to me.

119
00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.735
I feel I don't know him at all.

120
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.324
Everything's gonna be okay.

121
00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.994
Rest assure. it's gonna be okay.
We'll find him.

122
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:08.728
They were looking for something.

123
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:12.106
What was your dad up to?

124
00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.983
I don't know.

125
00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:16.986
But whoever was here.
went to his house too.

126
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.117
- What they were looking for?
- I don't know.

127
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.081
We're missing something. Daniel.

128
00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:31.834
Laura...

129
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.879
We should get out of here now.

130
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.507
Let's call the detective.
he'll know what to do.

131
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.343
Yeah. Let's do that.

132
00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:56.984
What do you think
they were looking for in the office?

133
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.486
I don't know.

134
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.113
Nobody had been there for a long time.

135
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.494
You saw it.
There were just blueprints. mockups...

136
00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:11.373
Whatever they were looking for.
I don't think they found it.

137
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.376
What do you mean?

138
00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:21.217
I feel this is just the beginning.

139
00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.346
Lau...

140
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:29.683
Do you think your father was involved
in something strange?

141
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.811
What do you mean?

142
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.984
I don't know.
you haven't seen him for ages.

143
00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.362
Precisely.

144
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.949
I just hope he's okay.

145
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.118
I'm sure he is.

146
00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:58.188
Hello?

147
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.233
Hello!

148
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.495
- Who is this?
- Hello. Laura Pereira?

149
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.622
Yes. Who are you?

150
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.833
My name is Francisco Rocha.
We need to talk.

151
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.586
I have news about your father.
I need you to come to my place.

152
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:56.246
- Did he say who he is?
- No. Just his name.

153
00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:03.629
I was waiting for you.

154
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:08.842
I'm glad you came.

155
00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:10.761
I didn't think you would.

156
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.473
Professor Rocha. you said
you had news about my father.

157
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:18.602
Yeah. but call me Francisco.
Have a seat. please.

158
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.687
Thank you.

159
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.861
How did you get my number?

160
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.698
Gonzalo gave it to me.

161
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:34.451
Gonzalo? What do you know
about my father?

162
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.455
Well. he disappeared without a trace.

163
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.499
Yes. How do you know that?

164
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.878
The police called me
to see if I had any information.

165
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:48.507
All I could tell them
was that I've known him for years.

166
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.760
Have you heard from him?

167
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:58.726
The police didn't find any clue.
We have no idea where he is.

168
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.063
They thought it may be a kidnapping.
but since nobody asked for ransom.

169
00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.857
they're ruling that out.

170
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:08.235
I wouldn't rule that out.

171
00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.488
Do you think it was an abduction?

172
00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:13.991
I do.

173
00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:18.328
But not the kind of abduction
you think.

174
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.371
What do you mean?

175
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:26.128
I don't know if you're aware
that your father was studying certain...

176
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.464
unusual phenomena.

177
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:31.633
He was obsessed with UFOs.
what does that have to do with it?

178
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:36.013
He came to see me a few days
before his disappearance.

179
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.475
Why? Who are you?

180
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.977
You know. now that I look at you...

181
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.355
you study this kind of phenomena. right?

182
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.818
That's right. I'm an ufologist.

183
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:54.615
I read an article about you a while ago.

184
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.869
What you guys study
is really science fiction.

185
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.371
Who are you?

186
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.750
Daniel Britos.
I'm Laura's partner.

187
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:11.882
Laura. your father told me
he'd been studying this things.

188
00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:18.013
and that in recent months.
he'd been making telepathic contacts

189
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.182
with entities from outside this world.

190
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.850
Let me get this straight.

191
00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:24.478
You're saying that we're here...

192
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:27.481
because Gonzalo
made contact with aliens?

193
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.607
That's right.

194
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.986
- Professor Rocha...
- Francisco.

195
00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:34.988
Let's just...

196
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.619
- Would you like some tea or coffee?
- No thank you. Francisco.

197
00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:41.703
I don't have coffee.

198
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.956
- Francisco...
- Yeah?

199
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.750
If you knew my father.
you must know he's not well.

200
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.504
Since my mom passed away.
his mind deteriorated.

201
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.259
Do you think he's crazy?

202
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.637
We think this is going nowhere.

203
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.312
Your father told me he feared
something could happen to him.

204
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:12.484
And he asked me to contact you
if that was the case.

205
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.361
Me? Why?

206
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:20.325
Because he sensed
someone was following him

207
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:22.744
to obtain the information
he was receiving.

208
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.873
- From aliens?
- That's right.

209
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.708
You need to understand this...

210
00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.004
The world we live in
is quite different...

211
00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:34.006
from the real world.

212
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.090
What do you mean?

213
00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.719
You know what I mean.
even if you deny it.

214
00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:42.264
But there's only one undeniable truth
in this world.

215
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:43.515
What truth?

216
00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.934
We are not alone.

217
00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:51.982
Laura. judging by the way
your father disappeared.

218
00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:55.068
I think we're dealing
with an alien abduction.

219
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.112
An alien abduction?

220
00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.453
Yes. It's much more common
than you think.

221
00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:08.031
Cases like these are reported
everyday around the world.

222
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:08.224
Cases like these are reported everyday around the
world. but they're silenced by the governments.

223
00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.876
But they're silenced
by the governments.

224
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:13.003
You're not making any sense.

225
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.631
Francisco...

226
00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:20.093
I understand this is your specialty.
I really do.

227
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:23.722
But you can't expect us to believe
this is what happened to my father.

228
00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:28.185
You can just leave and wait
for a more rational answer to show up.

229
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.603
but I assure you. it won't.

230
00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.279
No...

231
00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.983
Let's suppose for a second
your theory is correct.

232
00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:37.319
Why did they do it?

233
00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:41.698
I don't know.

234
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:47.871
Your father was afraid someone would
steal the information he was receiving.

235
00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:52.376
It's also possible
that whoever abducted him

236
00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:54.586
was trying to protect him
from this threat.

237
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.757
This will change everything.

238
00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.386
What do you think would happen

239
00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:05.264
if we can prove the existence
of beings from another planet.

240
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:09.351
of higher intelligence
and a much deeper spirituality?

241
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:13.105
Wait. You're talking as if there was
many different species of aliens.

242
00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:14.314
That's right. my dear.

243
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.935
There are thought to be
57 different species.

244
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.361
Maybe much more.

245
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.738
Some of them
want to experiment with us.

246
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:25.701
and others just want us
to reach their level...

247
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.329
- like they've done before.
- Before?

248
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:30.998
That's right.

249
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:34.626
They have been among us
since the beginning of our existence.

250
00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.587
How can you prove all this?

251
00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.508
Think about the civilizations.

252
00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.845
The Egyptians. the Mayans.
the Aztecs.

253
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.724
Think how similar they are...
in knowledge and in architecture.

254
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.852
That's all very questionable.

255
00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.356
Are you familiar with the Book of Enoc?

256
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:59.693
Yeah. it's an apocryphal text
from the Bible.

257
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:02.696
- How's that related?
- Perfect.

258
00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:07.868
It mentions space beings
coming down to Earth and meeting Enoc.

259
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.747
He describes them
as very large beings.

260
00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:16.209
He also mentions
that he was taken to a floating palace.

261
00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:22.215
where these beings spoke to him
about the universe and its secrets.

262
00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.636
Many believe these descriptions...

263
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.390
refer to angels.

264
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.851
But they don't.

265
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:35.854
If you dig deeper into the text.

266
00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:41.485
you can clearly see that he's talking
about another kind of visitors.

267
00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:46.615
The thing is. Francisco.
this is just your interpretation.

268
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:50.077
And many others'.

269
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:53.121
Think about the Nazca Lines.

270
00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:58.001
Huge drawings
that you can only see from the sky.

271
00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:00.754
Who were they made for?

272
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.591
They...

273
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:13.600
They've been among us since forever.

274
00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:14.726
And they've selected...

275
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.105
what information to give us...

276
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.857
and what to hide from us.

277
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:22.859
This is stupid.

278
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.445
It's real.
whether you believe it or not.

279
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.364
What scientific evidence do you have?

280
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.991
If you want a scientific answer...

281
00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:35.872
there is none.

282
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:40.627
I think that's enough.

283
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.212
We shouldn't have come here.

284
00:23:48.718 --> 00:23:49.761
Professor Rocha...

285
00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:53.265
I appreciate your intention to help us.

286
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:56.852
But I suffered enough
from my father's delusions.

287
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.188
Have a good day.

288
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:03.316
I know how this sounds.

289
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.989
You must think your father
was crazy and delusional.

290
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.116
It's okay.

291
00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:17.497
Laura. you want to find your father
and I want to help you.

292
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.877
Just this once...

293
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:25.005
I'm asking you
to believe the opposite.

294
00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:36.808
Hello?

295
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.609
Thank you. detective.
we'll be right there.

296
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:48.737
What did he say?

297
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:51.114
They found him in a park.
He's okay.

298
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.116
Thank God.

299
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.203
Did he say anything else?

300
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:03.001
He was raving about aliens.

301
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.589
Francisco...

302
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:11.760
If you want us to believe you.
now's the time.

303
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.261
Would you come with us?

304
00:25:14.262 --> 00:25:16.014
Of course. Laura.

305
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:30.862
That was fast.
Where's Laura?

306
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.114
Where's Gonzalo?

307
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:38.328
He's in a room. alone.

308
00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:42.249
A doctor saw him.
He's okay. but he won't stop raving.

309
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:44.209
Take me with him.

310
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:47.128
Let's go.

311
00:26:13.488 --> 00:26:14.614
Gonzalo...

312
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.618
Your son-in-law's here to pick you up.

313
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:26.001
Leave me alone with him.

314
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.382
Of course.

315
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:35.135
I'll be back in 15.

316
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:00.452
Where's my father?

317
00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:03.830
Where is he?

318
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:07.000
- He was with you.
- Not with me.

319
00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:13.381
Motherfucker...

320
00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.640
It's impossible.

321
00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:24.100
- Where is he?
- He was here a minute ago.

322
00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:25.352
Where is he?

323
00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:27.604
The parking lot. Follow me.

324
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.487
What's going on here?
Stop!

325
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:38.740
- This is impossible!
- Get away from him!

326
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:41.618
Get away from him right now!

327
00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:43.995
Now freeze!

328
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.623
I said freeze!

329
00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:48.708
He won't stop. detective!

330
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:04.015
We must get out of here.
Right now.

331
00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.811
Dad. are you okay?

332
00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:11.606
No. wait. Nobody leaves.

333
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:15.235
There's a dead person.
and I want to know what's going on.

334
00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:17.987
You won't understand. believe me.
Please. detective.

335
00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:19.614
Let's go.

336
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:22.826
Thank you.

337
00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:28.123
It's alright. We got you.

338
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.353
Gonzalo...

339
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:43.698
Help me. brother...

340
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.578
Gonzalo...

341
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.583
What have they done to you. man?

342
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.215
Thank you.

343
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

344
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.344
Francisco...

345
00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:08.640
What's next?

346
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:15.355
Your father hasn't said a word yet.

347
00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:25.073
We have to wait for him
to come out of shock to know more.

348
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:33.373
The information is there.
It's there.

349
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.375
I know it's there somewhere.

350
00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:45.134
He's deeply connected with them.
Very deeply.

351
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:47.095
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.

352
00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:51.975
It happened when mom died.

353
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.355
He got obsessed with all this.

354
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.569
Maybe he needed it to forget. right?

355
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:09.868
In cases like these...

356
00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:14.831
it's possible you start questioning...

357
00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:17.876
your own existence...

358
00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.454
the meaning of life...

359
00:31:21.504 --> 00:31:22.630
Yeah.

360
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:25.258
He changed completely after that.

361
00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:32.265
He became bad tempered. stubborn...

362
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.937
- He forgot my existence.
- Don't say that.

363
00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:39.731
Laura...

364
00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:42.609
Yeah.

365
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:45.987
He only cared about
what's beyond our planet.

366
00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:52.118
I'm sorry to hear that.

367
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:56.247
Okay.

368
00:31:56.998 --> 00:31:58.374
I should be going.

369
00:31:58.458 --> 00:32:00.752
Tomorrow's gonna be a very long day.

370
00:32:01.502 --> 00:32:02.879
Okay.

371
00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.133
- Okay.
- Francisco...

372
00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:09.636
Thank you. For everything.

373
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:11.846
Please.

374
00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:15.600
Francisco... why don't you stay
here with us tonight?

375
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:18.853
I don't want you to run into
one of them.

376
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.067
- Stay.
- Okay.

377
00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:25.944
Thank you.

378
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.951
- Still nothing?
- Yeah.

379
00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:37.580
Let him sleep on the bed.
I won't sleep.

380
00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:38.998
Me neither. honey.

381
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.506
POLICE STATION

382
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:56.148
POLICE

383
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.508
How's Gonzalo?

384
00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:31.718
He just fell asleep.

385
00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:36.973
Listen.

386
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.350
Do you believe all those things
Francisco said?

387
00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:42.729
I don't know what to believe. but...

388
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.355
what we saw was real.

389
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:49.610
That guy looked exactly like me.
He was identical.

390
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.613
This is madness.

391
00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:54.615
Just like dad's.

392
00:33:56.617 --> 00:33:58.119
It's worst.

393
00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:03.249
Thanks for being here with me
in this moment.

394
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.002
Where else would I be?

395
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.603
What is it?

396
00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:26.981
Dad. are you okay?

397
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:29.192
Better than ever.

398
00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:32.070
Gonzalo...

399
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.946
Would you like to see a doctor?

400
00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:36.365
No. No doctors.

401
00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:50.630
Thanks. Francisco.

402
00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:52.507
For what?

403
00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:57.587
For being there for my daughter.
and for trusting me still.

404
00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:00.640
- Please. You don't need to thank me.
- I do.

405
00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:01.849
- No.
- I do.

406
00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:03.810
You know it's an honour for me.

407
00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:10.358
Tell me. Gonzalo...
What happened?

408
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.072
I don't know.
I don't remember anything.

409
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.118
I feel like those memories
were wiped off.

410
00:35:22.578 --> 00:35:26.374
Losing memories
and the sense of time...

411
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:30.753
is very common
in alien abductions.

412
00:35:32.088 --> 00:35:34.966
Tell me Gonzalo.
what did they say to you?

413
00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:37.718
That...

414
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.139
I was the chosen one.

415
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:46.310
That they had a message for me.
but it wasn't the right time yet.

416
00:35:48.354 --> 00:35:51.315
I don't know. it was very strange.

417
00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.235
No matter where I was...

418
00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:58.364
they were inside me. in my head.
all the time.

419
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.994
- The chosen one.
- Yeah.

420
00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:10.501
Tell me Gonzalo. had you been
abducted by aliens before?

421
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:12.128
No.

422
00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:14.005
It was my first time.

423
00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:18.467
And if it wasn't for them.
I would've been killed.

424
00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:21.387
They saved me. Francisco.

425
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:24.140
Not just that.

426
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:29.061
I think they also
gave you the message.

427
00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:31.230
Why can't I remember?

428
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.858
I think it's in your subconsciousness.

429
00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:42.491
It feels weird to be talking about this
in front of you.

430
00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:45.620
I'm so glad.

431
00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:49.957
Excuse me.

432
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.003
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Gonzalo.

433
00:36:54.128 --> 00:36:55.254
Of course.

434
00:36:56.255 --> 00:37:00.259
What do you feel inside?

435
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.263
It's... strange. it's like...

436
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:06.933
Like what?

437
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.851
Like I knew something.

438
00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:12.438
- But you don't know what.
- Exactly.

439
00:37:16.442 --> 00:37:19.237
I have an idea that may work.

440
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:20.988
What?

441
00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:25.618
I would like to try hypnosis.
What do you think?

442
00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:26.744
Would that work?

443
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:31.874
I don't know.
but I think the chances are good.

444
00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:35.753
- If you're okay with it.
- Sure. Yeah. let's do it.

445
00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.839
Good.

446
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:49.183
I want you to lay down in the couch.
close your eyes...

447
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:51.852
there.

448
00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:56.607
I want you to relax...

449
00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:00.111
every muscle in your body.

450
00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:05.366
With every breath...

451
00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:09.578
you'll feel relaxed...

452
00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:12.123
more peaceful...

453
00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:16.627
Breathe...

454
00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:20.965
On the count of five.
you'll be at your house...

455
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.885
on the night they visited you...

456
00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:29.015
It will be alright.

457
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.185
You're peaceful.

458
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:38.858
Five. four...

459
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.986
three. two...

460
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.572
one...

461
00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.491
What's going on. Gonzalo?

462
00:38:52.872 --> 00:38:54.582
I'm coming home.

463
00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.628
I feel like something's chasing me.

464
00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.216
I get inside and close the door.

465
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.220
I call my daughter.

466
00:39:10.264 --> 00:39:11.724
She's not home.

467
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.936
They try to break in.

468
00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:19.106
They want to get in.

469
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:23.319
They're doing it.

470
00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:27.615
I see through the window.
I see...

471
00:39:29.992 --> 00:39:32.078
I see through the window.
I see...

472
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:33.245
What do you see. Gonzalo?

473
00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:38.584
I see a light...
A blinding light...

474
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.879
What happens now?

475
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.965
I'm in a familiar place.

476
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.011
I'm not alone.

477
00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:50.262
Oh God...

478
00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:52.765
What's happening. Gonzalo?

479
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.936
One of them is right beside me.

480
00:39:57.978 --> 00:39:58.854
What's he like?

481
00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:03.317
It's very tall.

482
00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:06.070
Strange skin...

483
00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.864
He doesn't want to hurt me.

484
00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:10.866
What does he want?

485
00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.454
To communicate.

486
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:17.248
How?

487
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.627
Telepathically.

488
00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.504
He wants to give me a message.

489
00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.506
What message?

490
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:34.974
From the constellation of Sah...

491
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:39.728
Enki and their descendents
will return...

492
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:45.109
We must prepare for the final phase...

493
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.365
I want you to come back to me.

494
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:55.119
In five. four. three.

495
00:40:55.578 --> 00:40:57.746
two. one...

496
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.835
Dad. are you okay?

497
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.628
Are you okay?

498
00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:06.213
Yeah.

499
00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:11.010
What happened?
Did it work?

500
00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:16.974
You were abducted to receive a message.

501
00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:19.435
What message?

502
00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:21.979
That we should prepare
for the final phase. Gonzalo.

503
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:24.607
- I can't believe it.
- What's going on?

504
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:26.108
What's the final phase?

505
00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:29.111
Their way of contact.
The final way.

506
00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:35.201
We will be together again.
like in ancient times.

507
00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:36.994
And when's that gonna happen?

508
00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:44.001
I think that information...

509
00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:47.755
still remains in Gonzalo's
subconsciousness.

510
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:53.010
They will decide
when will we know.

511
00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:56.388
In the message. dad said...

512
00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.059
that Enki and their descendents
would return.

513
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:02.603
Who's Enki?

514
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:04.730
Anunnaki.

515
00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:07.107
What's Anunnaki?
What are you talking about?

516
00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:08.283
Enki...

517
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:14.240
also known as the Lord of Earth.
is a god from the Sumerian mythology.

518
00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:18.244
But Enki isn't a god.

519
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:23.832
He's an alien creature from
the civilization know as the Anunnakis.

520
00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:29.380
How's that related to us?
Why did he say they would return?

521
00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:32.758
Because the Anunnakis
created the human race.

522
00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:36.762
They've been among us since
the beginning of our existence. Laura.

523
00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:38.013
What?

524
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.600
Many civilizations point out...

525
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:46.814
that we were created genetically
by space beings.

526
00:42:49.942 --> 00:42:53.487
And many specialists agree
with this theory.

527
00:42:56.365 --> 00:43:00.869
Many years ago. they found
clay tablets from the Sumerian people.

528
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:02.871
As they translated them...

529
00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:06.875
they found amazing...

530
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:10.129
revelations.

531
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.967
They revealed that the human race
was created by the Anunnakis.

532
00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.387
Furthermore...

533
00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:22.308
they provided the Sumerians
with knowledge...

534
00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:25.603
of science...

535
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:28.105
of astronomy...

536
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:32.735
thus making them
the first advanced civilization...

537
00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:35.696
of human kind.

538
00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:42.244
Some believe the Anunnakis
remained with us

539
00:43:43.245 --> 00:43:45.122
in the course of our existence.

540
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.124
That's impossible.

541
00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:49.752
Science knows well
where we came from.

542
00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:54.632
Nobody could debunk Darwin.
not even the Church. This can't be true.

543
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:59.011
Science has its story.
and religion has another one.

544
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:02.640
They both have plotholes
in their versions.

545
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:06.977
Darwin's evolution theory
doesn't really explain

546
00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:10.481
the evolutionary leap
from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens.

547
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:11.857
And this explains it?

548
00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:13.734
Maybe.

549
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.987
These beings' genetic experimentation

550
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:19.865
could explain how the monkey
evolved to be human.

551
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:25.245
Putting an end to the endless search
for that missing link they never found.

552
00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:27.373
If this is true...

553
00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.876
it will change our entire existence.

554
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.379
I know.

555
00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:37.716
The message mentioned
the constellation of Sah.

556
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.885
What's that about?

557
00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.721
Sah's an Egyptian god.

558
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:45.724
And the constellation
that represents him is Orion.

559
00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.103
Several studies mention...

560
00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:52.356
that the Egyptians and the Mayans...

561
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:56.235
knew where these space beings
came from.

562
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.696
which they clearly showed
in their constructions.

563
00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:01.615
No. I know those constructions
very well.

564
00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.992
How did they clearly showed it?

565
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:09.873
The Pyramids of Giza are perfectly
aligned with Orion.

566
00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:15.754
If you draw an imaginary line
towards the sky...

567
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:20.718
you'll see the alignment is flawless.

568
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:25.764
But they're not the only ones.

569
00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.852
The Mayans had their own pyramids.

570
00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:32.938
in Teotihuac♪n.
a sacred place for them.

571
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.357
They're also precisely aligned
with Orion.

572
00:45:35.482 --> 00:45:37.443
So that's where they came from?

573
00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:42.698
There are a lot of theories
of where the Anunnakis came from.

574
00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:48.871
Some people say
they came from a gigantic planet...

575
00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.749
called Planet X.

576
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:55.961
which every 3.600 years
enters our Solar System.

577
00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.588
causing disasters.

578
00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.091
Others believe
the home of the Anunnakis

579
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.386
is the constellation of the Pleiades.

580
00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:10.309
but some of us think
they found other places to inhabit.

581
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:14.229
That's a different matter.

582
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.482
What are we going to do?

583
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.817
I don't know yet.

584
00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:23.363
I wanna go home.
I need my computer. actually.

585
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.241
I need more information.

586
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:31.622
I'll give you a ride.

587
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:33.749
I'll go too.

588
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.460
I don't think we should separate.

589
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.712
Don't worry. we'll be okay.

590
00:46:39.838 --> 00:46:41.006
Come with me.

591
00:46:44.009 --> 00:46:47.012
- Do you realize how dangerous this is?
- Relax.

592
00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:52.476
- What about your father?
- Stay here and look after him.

593
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:57.856
- Laura. we should get going.
- Yeah. in a sec.

594
00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:07.449
- Francisco...
- Yeah?

595
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:10.577
Do you really think my dad knows
when the final phase's gonna be?

596
00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:14.957
The increase of sightings
we've been having in recent times

597
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:18.001
shows us they want to contact us
more than ever.

598
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:21.880
Your father was chosen.
along with others.

599
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:25.759
to receive this information
and pass it on to the others.

600
00:47:25.884 --> 00:47:27.469
What's going to happen
when they come?

601
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:31.223
Nobody knows. Some believe
it could be the end of the world.

602
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:36.854
Others think they'll start a new era
of peace and spirituality for everyone.

603
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.939
What do you think?

604
00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:44.236
I think we're on the verge
of a new evolutionary leap.

605
00:47:45.237 --> 00:47:46.613
Like thousands of years ago.

606
00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:49.867
Do you think that Enki will return?

607
00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:56.248
If the Anunnakis are coming.
he'd better return.

608
00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:00.377
According to the Sumerian mythology.

609
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.755
Enki advocated for the human race.

610
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.091
Wait.

611
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.135
According to the Sumerian tablets.

612
00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:11.722
the Anunnakis created us
to be their slaves.

613
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:14.933
Slaves?

614
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.102
Yes. that's right.

615
00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:19.229
Initially.

616
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.570
See. Enki was a geneticist.
and he took part in the human creation.

617
00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:28.989
He didn't think of us as slaves.

618
00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:33.577
He believed the human race deserved
to have a chance. to be free.

619
00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.580
Unfortunately. Enlil didn't.

620
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:37.831
Who's Enlil?

621
00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:43.587
His brother. with whom he always
had a power struggle about this planet.

622
00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:45.255
And where is he now?

623
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:53.138
Remember when I said some Anunnakis
found other places to inhabit?

624
00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:56.058
- Yeah.
- We believe this planet is hollow.

625
00:48:56.725 --> 00:49:02.814
and that several alien species
live inside it.

626
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.816
all ruled by Enlil.

627
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:08.236
So we don't even own our planet?

628
00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:12.449
Something like that.

629
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.369
We're living a lie.

630
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:24.711
Hello?

631
00:49:26.588 --> 00:49:29.383
- Hello?
- What is it?

632
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:32.010
I don't know. it happened before.
I only hear static.

633
00:49:32.886 --> 00:49:35.138
He intercepted us.
He knows where we are.

634
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.724
- Who?
- The creature you were talking to.

635
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:41.561
- What do we do?
- We must go. He knows where we are.

636
00:49:41.603 --> 00:49:42.729
Hurry.

637
00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:54.691
What took you so long?

638
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:57.119
Daniel. they're following us.
We're in danger.

639
00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:58.870
Wait. I have an idea.

640
00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:05.502
Who are you calling?

641
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:08.630
Who are you calling. Daniel?

642
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.967
- The detective.
- The detective's dead by now!

643
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.512
Whoever answers. it's not him!

644
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:17.639
Hello?

645
00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.684
I know a safe place we can go to.

646
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.506
Tell me. is that place safe for us?

647
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:55.635
I want you to stay here.
It's too dangerous.

648
00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:58.096
What are you saying?
I'll go with you.

649
00:50:58.889 --> 00:50:59.890
No.

650
00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:01.975
Why not?

651
00:51:02.934 --> 00:51:04.728
I have to do this alone.

652
00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:10.609
- I won't leave you now.
- Daniel... I need it.

653
00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:12.611
I have to know what's going on.

654
00:51:15.363 --> 00:51:18.366
This could be very dangerous.
Please be careful.

655
00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:20.869
I'll be okay.

656
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:24.623
I just need
to clear things up with dad.

657
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:27.876
To put an end to all this.

658
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:30.587
Please understand.

659
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:35.383
Okay.

660
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:42.636
It's been long
since the last time I was here.

661
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:45.513
I didn't know about this place.

662
00:53:47.265 --> 00:53:49.559
You were going to know eventually.

663
00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:03.865
When I'm here. I feel like...
your mother's here with me.

664
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.494
I feel it too. dad.

665
00:54:17.128 --> 00:54:18.964
I'm sorry. daughter.

666
00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:23.635
I'm sorry for all the pain
that I caused you.

667
00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.764
For everything I made you go through.
I'm sorry.

668
00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:30.600
- It was really hard.
- I know.

669
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:32.727
I know.

670
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:35.230
Why did you push me away?

671
00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:41.319
- I wasn't in my right mind.
- And how do you think I was?

672
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:43.863
I lost mom...

673
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:46.199
then I lost you.

674
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:48.576
I was left alone.

675
00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:52.497
I needed you.

676
00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:58.712
Believe me. if I could turn back time.
I would.

677
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.964
But you can't.

678
00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:02.757
No...

679
00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:04.759
You can't.

680
00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:10.140
I got really scared
when you disappeared.

681
00:55:12.058 --> 00:55:14.227
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

682
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:21.443
It's over. it's over...

683
00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:25.488
It's over.

684
00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:29.701
I was lost for a very long time.
but it's over.

685
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:33.621
Things have fallen into place now.

686
00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.834
I'm so proud of you.

687
00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.838
You're the most important thing
in my life.

688
00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:47.093
I don't want to lose you again. dad.

689
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:48.636
Can you promise me I won't?

690
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:53.058
Can you?

691
00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.107
What should we do now?

692
00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:04.110
We must hide... and wait.

693
00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:06.363
Wait for what?

694
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.575
For the information in your father
to manifest itself.

695
00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:42.440
- Who is it?
- Open the door. It's me.

696
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.573
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

697
00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:51.699
I changed my mind.

698
00:56:52.492 --> 00:56:53.868
Is everything okay?

699
00:56:53.993 --> 00:56:55.829
Yes. I wanted to talk to you.

700
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:14.139
About what?

701
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:18.101
Your father...

702
00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:21.779
where is he?

703
00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:24.816
That's what I want to know.

704
00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:30.989
Who are you?

705
00:57:34.576 --> 00:57:36.119
Where's Gonzalo?

706
00:57:36.369 --> 00:57:37.829
I won't tell you.

707
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:40.582
I don't need you to tell me.

708
00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:10.862
God...

709
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:15.325
I'm ready for whatever
you planned for me.

710
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.357
Laura?

711
00:58:53.738 --> 00:58:54.864
Francisco...

712
00:58:55.073 --> 00:58:57.742
I can't find dad anywhere.
what time is it?

713
00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.578
- Ten o'clock.
- It's been an hour.

714
00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:02.121
He should be here by now.

715
00:59:02.455 --> 00:59:04.749
- Do you think something happened to him?
- I don't know.

716
00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.751
- Let's go find him.
- Yeah.

717
00:59:19.639 --> 00:59:20.974
I know that place.

718
00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:32.318
Dad!

719
00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.092
Enki...

720
00:59:57.635 --> 00:59:59.012
I was waiting for you.

721
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.565
There's nothing you can do for them.

722
01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.484
You will never defeat Enlil.

723
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.420
Enlil...

724
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.623
is next.

725
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.463
Dad...

726
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:19.384
Dad... everything will be alright.

727
01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.511
I'll go get some help
and you will recover.

728
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.972
It doesn't have to be this way.
daughter.

729
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.724
What are you saying?

730
01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.728
My time is over.

731
01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:33.606
I did what I had to do.

732
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:35.858
What was that?

733
01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:40.988
To tell you... that I love you.

734
01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.825
I love you too. dad.

735
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.203
Don't leave me alone again.

736
01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.456
You'll never be alone.

737
01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.209
I know that now.

738
01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:59.632
Your mother's waiting for me.

739
01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.009
No. no. no!

740
01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.094
No!

741
01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:07.473
No...

742
01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.435
No. dad...

743
01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.564
No!

744
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.701
ONE MONTH LATER

745
01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.203
How's Laura?

746
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:32.248
You know. it's hard.

747
01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.375
She returned to work.

748
01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.881
But Gonzalo's death...

749
01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.633
was very painful to us all.

750
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.136
Yes. I can imagine.

751
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.433
What's up with you?

752
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.941
I... don't mean to sound insensitive...

753
01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.694
It's okay. Go ahead.

754
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.864
But I think there's more to know.

755
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.826
Much more.

756
01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.371
About the final phase?

757
01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:13.456
Yeah.

758
01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:20.963
When I hypnotized him.
there were holes.

759
01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:24.509
What holes?

760
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:27.345
He mentioned that on the night
he was abducted.

761
01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:32.183
he was in... a familiar place.

762
01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:35.603
What does it mean?

763
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.730
That he was comfortable.

764
01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:40.441
What do you think?

765
01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:45.738
I think he...
he came to leave something for us.

766
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.618
I don't know if he was supposed
to tell us what it was.

767
01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:52.703
but...

768
01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.834
But what. Francisco?
Please.

769
01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:01.337
...he was supposed to tell us
where it is.

770
01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.718
What about the country house?

771
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:13.850
The house...

772
01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.693
Hi Lau.

773
01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:26.112
Hi honey. I'm about to enter a meeting.
What's up?

774
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.949
No. I can't put it off.
What is it?

775
01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.371
I'm on my way.

776
01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:01.355
Well...

777
01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.483
Let's start looking.

778
01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.320
Any luck?

779
01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:08.362
Nothing.

780
01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.740
Maybe I was wrong.

781
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:15.494
I had a feeling
that there was something here.

782
01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.002
I found something.

783
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.256
- What is it?
- I don't know.

784
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:53.574
Are you ready?

785
01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:55.868
Yes.

786
01:05:57.495 --> 01:05:59.872
Hi daughter.
I hope you're watching this.

787
01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:02.625
We're not alone.

788
01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.710
We never were.

789
01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:09.632
The world as we know it
will change dramatically.

790
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.136
The truth will be revealed soon.

791
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:18.182
A truth that will change
all our paradigms.

792
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.854
That's why I want to prepare you
for that moment.

793
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:31.237
In the next video...
I will explain that truth.

794
01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:40.246
And I will probably
not be alive by then.

795
01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:47.628
So you'll have to decide
whether to make it public or not.

796
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.757
I trust you'll do the right thing.

797
01:06:55.886 --> 01:06:57.096
I love you.

798
01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.765
I've always loved you.

799
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.617
Today. April 12...

800
01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:22.580
I'm making this video
for anyone who wants to hear it.

801
01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:27.877
I've been studying
the UFO phenomenon for several years.

802
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:36.969
And six months ago.
I made contact with an alien species.

803
01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:38.262
called the Anunnakis.

804
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:43.350
They contacted me to pass a message.

805
01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.730
The message is that...

806
01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:51.484
the day of the final encounter
is coming.

807
01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.486
Very soon.

808
01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:58.199
They will return in a year from now.

809
01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:02.995
They will be present
and made contact with us once again.

810
01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.251
They want us to be ready
for that moment. and...

811
01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.504
to know the entire truth.

812
01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:17.384
And that truth
is that they created us.

813
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.640
There are many interests
against making public this truth.

814
01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:30.856
from people who provoke wars.
who seek their own destruction.

815
01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:32.858
but they will protect us.

816
01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:36.987
I know...

817
01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:42.243
some people will think this video...

818
01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:48.249
is strange. is a surprise.

819
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.337
I'm asking them...

820
01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:55.005
to believe.

821
01:08:58.342 --> 01:09:00.386
Believe what I'm saying.

822
01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:11.480
I waited all my life to hear this.

823
01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.986
Now we know
that they'll be here in a year.

824
01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.992
The whole world will be shocked.

825
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.744
We're not ready for this.

826
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:29.874
I know.

827
01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.127
But they have to know.

828
01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.008
Francisco...

829
01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.260
Are you going to make it public?

830
01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:53.355
Daniel... this goes against
everything we know.

831
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.109
The world will change.
We can't hide this information.

832
01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:00.112
Yes. I think so too.

833
01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:02.990
But if we do this.
we'll be targeted.

834
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.493
I know. But we must prepare people
for what's coming.

835
01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:09.997
Besides. once we spread the news.
no one can hide the truth.

836
01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.249
What if they don't believe us?

837
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.002
Sooner or later. they will.

838
01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:18.255
That's the story.

839
01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.967
Hard to believe?

840
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:25.888
Our world is too.

841
01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:31.101
New things are discovered
everyday in our planet.

842
01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:37.566
Species that we believed extinct...

843
01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.818
reappear.

844
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.614
Natural wonders that amaze us...

845
01:10:44.823 --> 01:10:46.492
that thrill us.

846
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:49.495
Multiply...

847
01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.207
triple all that...

848
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.252
in the immensity of the universe.

849
01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.381
How much more there is to learn?

850
01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.968
Surely a lot.

851
01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:08.472
And I don't know if you heard this. but...

852
01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:15.187
there has been many reports
of sightings these last few days

853
01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:17.815
in different parts of the world.

854
01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:22.736
Do you think that's related.
or is it just a coincidence?

855
01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:26.699
No. it's no coincidence at all.

856
01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:30.244
This will increasingly get bigger
until the final phase day.

857
01:11:33.747 --> 01:11:37.835
The final phase.
which will take place in...

858
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:43.757
I'm sorry. it's just... so hard to say it.

859
01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.885
In a year?

860
01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.263
Exactly.

861
01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:56.186
Actually... no one's ready yet.

862
01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:00.983
When they arrive. it will be up to us...

863
01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:05.738
to make it a great day
for humanity.

864
01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:10.492
They're waiting for us to decide...

865
01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:16.874
what kind of world do we want.

866
01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:21.378
And fundamentally.
if we're willing to share it.

867
01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.881
What do you think?

868
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.636
I don't know.

869
01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.389
I can't answer that.

870
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.061
I would like to. but I can't.

871
01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:43.359
Thank you so much. professor Rocha.
for being here with us tonight.

872
01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:46.945
It was a real pleasure
to have you here.

873
01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:51.992
Any final message you want to give?

874
01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.500
When the day comes...

875
01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.505
don't be afraid.

876
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.477
That was the day
everybody's lives changed.

877
01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:27.069
As for me. I'm continuing
what my father couldn't finish.

878
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.752
Enki...

879
01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.755
I'm ready.
What's next?

880
01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.487
THE FINAL PHASE

881
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.115
PART ONE
