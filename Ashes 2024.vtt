3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.920
What is reality. and what is fiction?

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.280
We need to think about it.
I think life is fooling us all.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.680
Reality could be a lie
that someone made up. don't you think?

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.440
Maybe we're all living
in someone else's dream.

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.400
ASHES

8
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.000
Yes!

9
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.480
So thank you all for coming.

10
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.600
You know I'm not really the type
to give speeches.

11
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.800
Forty years ago.
when my father founded Urkan Publishing.

12
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.400
we had many friends
and trusted writers by our side.

13
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.360
There were thousands of readers.
Our first publication was The Sea of Life.

14
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.680
We've had so many memories and ideas
since then. right?

15
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.360
Yeah.

16
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.240
But no one reads books anymore.

17
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.800
And throughout most of this adventure.
my dear wife has been with me.

18
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.680
She's still the first to read the books.

19
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.880
and I always trust her instincts.

20
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.360
Today is our tenth wedding anniversary.

21
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
Gökçe. I'm glad to have you. To have us.

22
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.840
I'll end this boring speech now.
Glad you came. To friends!

23
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.880
To friends!

24
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.840
I'm not the only one
who thinks that way. Others also…

25
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960
I'm telling you as a friend
to stop writing about your life.

26
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.160
Try something else.

27
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.280
Oh. Gökçe. look.

28
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.760
Your husband no longer likes what I write.

29
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.280
He thinks I should try different stuff.
Okay. What about this?

30
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.560
I read it in a news piece the other day.

31
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.600
A tailor in Maltepe. Istanbul.

32
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.440
believes that Anna Karenina really exists.

33
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.200
Doesn't just believe.
He left his family and went to Russia.

34
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560
-What?
-If it was a series or a movie…

35
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640
-We wouldn't believe it.
-He believed it!

36
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.080
Go inside the house.

37
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.720
Grab some stuff.

38
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.880
Come on. Go inside.

39
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.600
Kill those guys.

40
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.240
Tap on that.

41
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.120
ASHES

42
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.920
"Ashes will never burn."

43
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.680
"They are the residue of a burning love."

44
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.920
"How would you know if you've met someone
not from this world?"

45
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680
"What if you're the one
who doesn't belong to this world?"

46
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.920
"What if you're sleeping…"

47
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.960
Inside whoever's mind my words resonate.
their destiny will be rewritten.

48
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.440
I'll start by bidding myself farewell.

49
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.480
Morning. Ceylan.

50
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.600
-We didn't order the pink.
-True.

51
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.240
-We ordered the blue.
-Yes.

52
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.600
People I've known
and those who've passed me by

53
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.040
are in my memories.

54
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.680
I remember all those faces.

55
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.920
-Hello.
-Welcome. Ms. Gökçe.

56
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.720
Thank you. Mom?

57
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.760
-Gökçe?
-Yes.

58
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.000
I'm leaving them behind for a new life.
which is why I am writing.

59
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.320
So someone can witness the life I've had.

60
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.320
Whoever gets hold of this book will know
that a single person is responsible

61
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.160
for all the coincidences.

62
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.080
ASHES

63
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.680
That person whose name
I dare not say in full is "M."

64
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.280
It's like all the streets in Balat
lead to him.

65
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.800
M's terrifying aggression
and mysterious silence were pulling me in.

66
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.320
A circle of life tattoo on his right arm.

67
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.960
The shadow of a bird on his neck.

68
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160
Here's where it all started.

69
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.440
A small bakery in Balat.

70
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.720
With M's secret.
this bakery would turn into a memory

71
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.120
that dragged us both into obscurity.

72
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.480
MÜŞFİKA BAKERY

73
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.120
What turns this place into a miracle
are the ashes flying around.

74
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.600
Only I can see them.

75
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.840
It was as if the signs were guiding my way

76
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.320
and leading me
to Müşfika Bakery every time.

77
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.560
MÜŞFİKA BAKERY

78
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.440
-Hi. Lale. Good morning.
-Good morning. honey.

79
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.840
What's up?

80
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.080
I'm doing fine. Why so early?

81
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.000
I have a proposal for you.

82
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.520
This is the place.
Where is the door? Oh. here. Come.

83
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.560
MÜŞFİKA BAKERY

84
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.880
-Hello.
-Greetings. welcome.

85
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.840
Thank you.

86
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.520
Don't stand there. Have a seat.

87
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.560
Gökçe. I don't know
how you came across this place.

88
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.360
In one of the books they sent over.

89
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.800
It mentioned this bakery.

90
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.320
What?

91
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.160
The protagonist buys simit from here.

92
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.800
Some guy called "M."

93
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.000
"M"?

94
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.440
M. That's what it says.

95
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.520
The name isn't revealed.
Anyway. he's a strange man.

96
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.400
An otherworldly type.

97
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.800
He has tattoos with deep meaning
on his throat and arm.

98
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.200
He changes the lives of those
who cross paths with him.

99
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.120
Gökçe. are you okay?

100
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.040
I am. I'm fine.

101
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.520
What you read is a novel. It's fiction.

102
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.320
You're aware. right?

103
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.080
But the bakery is real.

104
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.720
-Maybe so is the man. What's the big deal?
-I can't believe you.

105
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.680
No. I can't drink this. Come on. honey.

106
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.040
Let's just go.

107
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.440
Let's have our coffee somewhere decent.

108
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.000
Go ahead. I'll look around.

109
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.040
Fine. As you wish.

110
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.720
M kept his past in the carpentry shop.

111
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.760
The signs led me on a path to this shop.

112
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.280
which was his sanctuary.

113
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.520
Just when I thought I was lost.
the ashes led me to his doorstep.

114
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.360
I realized that I had no choice
but to follow M like the ashes did.

115
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.120
Okay. I'll email you.

116
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.320
Okay. I'll send it now.

117
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.520
-Hi. Ms. Gökçe.
-Hi.

118
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.160
Mr. Kenan is on an important call.

119
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.120
-You can wait here.
-Sure.

120
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.480
-Can I get you anything?
-I have what I need. Thanks.

121
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560
Yes. correct.

122
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.440
Okay. I'll wait to hear from you.

123
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.240
All right. Keep up the good work.

124
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.680
-Hi.
-Hi.

125
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.840
At this hour. Gökçe? Is something wrong?

126
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.400
I thought we'd have coffee.

127
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.800
-Who's watching the boutique?
-Ceylan. It's quiet anyway.

128
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.440
Well. good thinking.

129
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.760
but it's a busy day today. so…

130
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.640
I forgot to send the email.

131
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.480
-Should I go?
-No. it's okay.

132
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.040
I just need to resend something.

133
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.960
Uğur Örtün is here.

134
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.000
-In here or in the meeting room?
-The latter. I'm coming.

135
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.520
All right.

136
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.160
Okay.

137
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.560
-See you.
-Good luck.

138
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.480
Thanks.

139
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.040
Hidden in secrets.
this tower belonged to the two of us.

140
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.000
It was a place among the gods.

141
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.320
Each time. we took a different path
inside this dark tunnel

142
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.720
to reach the door at the end.
which opened up to the sky.

143
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.000
When we opened the door.

144
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.640
we'd leave our boring lives behind
and step into another universe.

145
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.840
"Once I was through that door.
I forgot my past. I erased it all."

146
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.520
"He was my guide to take me to the sky."

147
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.360
Hello. Welcome.

148
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.920
Thanks. I was told there's a tower here.
Do you know it?

149
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.800
A tower? I don't know of any tower.

150
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.520
Okay. I'll ask someone else.

151
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.080
-Peace be upon you.
-Thanks. you too.

152
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.640
-Can I have three simits?
-Hello?

153
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.000
-Three simits.
-Yeah.

154
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.240
Yes. sir. I was about to call you.

155
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.400
Yes. sir.

156
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.560
Yes. there are missing pieces.

157
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.880
Not just color. but size as well.

158
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.440
It's not adding up.

159
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.560
Okay. Just bring the boxes.
however many there are.

160
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.880
I need them this week. I have to go.
Later. Okay. Talk to you later.

161
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.600
Hello?

162
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.120
Are you a carpenter?

163
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.200
Yes. How can I help?

164
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.400
I want to order a mirror.
I need one at my boutique.

165
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.640
-Where is it?
-In Nişantaşı.

166
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.080
Nişantaşı.

167
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.240
Do you have measurements?
Do you know what you want?

168
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.200
No measurements.
Just a mirror with a wooden frame.

169
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.880
-We're busy. Maybe another time.
-It's pretty simple.

170
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.320
Is it urgent or not?

171
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.480
It's not.

172
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.520
All good. then.

173
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.400
Sorry. what's your name?

174
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.880
It's Ali.

175
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.640
I'll decide on the size and come back.

176
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.800
Whenever you like.

177
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.240
Metin Ali Soykan?

178
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.800
This is for you.

179
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.160
ID number and signature.

180
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.000
Here you go.

181
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.200
Did you forget something?

182
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720
To get your number.

183
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480
Metin Ali. right?

184
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.880
They call me Ali.
Not many know about Metin.

185
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.640
I'm Gökçe. Nice to meet you.

186
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.360
I'll call you with the measurements.

187
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.080
How is this spot for the mirror. Ceylan?

188
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.480
I don't think we need another mirror. but…

189
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.760
Get the measuring tape.

190
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.080
Let's measure the height.

191
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.640
Let's see. All the way down.

192
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.200
Hi. Mr. Metin.

193
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.760
Yes. it's Gökçe.

194
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.440
I'm calling with the measurements.

195
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.280
It's 80 x 150.

196
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.800
It'll be vertical. Cheval-style.

197
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.760
Okay. See you.

198
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840
Bye.

199
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.040
Love and war are the same.

200
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.480
They both resemble a fight between wolves.

201
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.200
While the man and the woman squirm
under each other's fur.

202
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.480
they sink their claws
into the other's heart.

203
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.480
It's wild. It's ugly. And it's filthy.

204
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.640
If M hadn't taught me the real thing.
I would not have discovered my power.

205
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.800
Gökçe?

206
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.640
Wait.

207
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.440
The truths have reached a deadlock
as they sink in.

208
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.520
Can a heart love two people at once?

209
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.400
I was devastated
after learning that M was married.

210
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.160
A huge wreck.

211
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.360
Heartbroken. I wanted to surrender myself
to the arms of death.

212
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.480
The only problem was. who would do it?

213
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.240
We have a more casual one too.

214
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.960
-Yes.
-Again. mini.

215
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.080
-You'd rock this color.
-It looks nice.

216
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.280
-We also have this.
-Yes. this is nice.

217
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.040
Welcome.

218
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.040
I'll get my gear.

219
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.160
This is nice too.

220
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.080
How about this? Also pretty.

221
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.360
Very pretty.

222
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520
Nice.

223
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.400
Ceylan. could you help?

224
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.800
It's going by that wall.

225
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.320
We'll need to move these. but…

226
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.400
I hope I measured it correctly.

227
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.400
I hope so too.

228
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.240
I'd gotten so attached to M

229
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.480
that all I could do was
forget that he was married.

230
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.520
It's done. Do you like it?

231
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200
I guess so. but…

232
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.240
You don't like it?

233
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.120
It's kind of in the way.

234
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.720
Maybe we should hang it on the wall.

235
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.960
Well. this was built with a stand.
It's made of wood. so it's heavy.

236
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.240
The wall won't hold it. We can try. but…

237
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.240
I think it'd look better.
What do you think. Ceylan?

238
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.760
However you like. Ms. Gökçe.

239
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.920
It'll look better on the wall. won't it?

240
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.960
I'll remove the stand. It'll take time.

241
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:31.920
Okay.

242
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.520
A little higher.

243
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.600
No. it's too high. A little…

244
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.840
Like. in the middle.

245
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400
Lower.

246
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.080
That's too much.

247
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.760
A little to the left.

248
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.200
Are you all right?

249
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.680
I'm fine.

250
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.400
Made quite a mess here.

251
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.400
-You cut your hand?
-It's nothing.

252
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.440
Get some peroxide and gauze
from the pharmacy.

253
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.080
-No need. Just a scratch. I'm used to it.
-Please sit. Here.

254
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.880
-Really.
-Okay. just sit.

255
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.200
-This…
-Maybe we should apply pressure.

256
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.600
Here. right?

257
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.200
Until she comes. let's just…

258
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.240
I didn't expect the mirror
to fall off the frame.

259
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.440
I didn't think the wall would hold it.

260
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.960
-And it fell.
-It was me…

261
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.160
The frame was loose. Sorry for the mess.

262
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.040
Please. I insisted.
It's on me. I insisted way too much.

263
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.720
-The frame… Huh?
-Your… Huh?

264
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.480
The frame. I'm going to tighten it again.

265
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.160
Damn. all that work.
And the place is a mess.

266
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.280
Please. No problem at all.
Don't mind that. It's nothing.

267
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.960
Did you maybe drop your ring?

268
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.080
Over there.

269
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.760
What do you mean?

270
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.160
You're missing one.

271
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.280
Maybe because I'm single.

272
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.720
Single?

273
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.520
Yes. I'm single.

274
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.120
Never been married?

275
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.760
Darling. remember what Kenan told us?

276
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.800
That you may not publish
Taner's new book? I think…

277
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.360
Why are you laughing?

278
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.520
Sorry. I remembered something.

279
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
What is it?

280
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.960
Remember the book I told you about?

281
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.280
It's that carpenter.

282
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.440
So?

283
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.320
He came to the boutique.

284
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.200
And he found it how?

285
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.040
I found him.

286
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.920
You chased after a man you don't know?

287
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.040
I feel like I know him.

288
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.320
It's that book.

289
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.320
Not all the stairs in the tower
led up to the sky.

290
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.320
It turned out the tower liked to play
with those without a guide.

291
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.880
constantly misleading them
in the darkness.

292
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.520
To find my way. I left a mark
on every wall and corner I passed by.

293
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.920
The only proof of what I had with M is
carved on the walls of this tower.

294
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.280
You didn't meet me by the door.

295
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.600
I was waiting. Did the bell ring early?

296
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680
No.

297
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.080
Get in.

298
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.080
What are you doing?

299
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.400
Son. what are you doing?

300
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.560
What are you doing. dear?

301
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.880
Did you secretly go through my bag? Huh?

302
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.800
Couldn't you find something else
to draw on. Ege? Why?

303
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.560
I'm playing.

304
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.680
Gökçe?

305
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.120
He's just playing.

306
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.480
With a book that was sent to us.

307
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.480
It's just a first draft.
What's the big deal?

308
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.760
I haven't finished it yet.

309
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.160
I'm sorry.

310
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.040
But don't do it again. okay?

311
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.160
I will.

312
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.400
The lights that M turned on
illuminated the whole city.

313
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.840
No rules apply here.

314
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.920
I wonder if anyone sees the ashes
flying around us when we're together.

315
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.520
İlyas. go and get Latif.

316
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.520
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome.

317
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.600
Is the mirror ready?

318
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.800
I couldn't get it cut yet. I was going to.
I'll get it cut and drop it off.

319
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.040
Okay. No problem.

320
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.600
How is your hand?

321
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.960
Here is tea…

322
00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.640
Why don't we talk outside?

323
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.880
Sure.

324
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.640
It's starting to rain.

325
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.000
This is how it is here.
Always unpredictable. It'll stop soon.

326
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.160
Yes?

327
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.600
No. sir. My job there is done.

328
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.400
We delivered it intact.
You should talk to the courier company.

329
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.120
Nothing to do with us.

330
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.360
I get that the door is broken…

331
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.480
I know a place
that makes spicy Albanian köfte.

332
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.760
-Shall we have some köfte there?
-Okay.

333
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.240
Check. please.

334
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.640
It's good.

335
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.560
They make good köfte.

336
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.000
Did you grow up here?

337
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.040
Born and raised in Balat.

338
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.160
Around my carpenter's shop.
that's my whole world.

339
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.800
The Balat Bazaar.

340
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.040
I've been there.

341
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.240
-The bakery.
-I've been around.

342
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.360
Coming right up.

343
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.240
I've never been here before.

344
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480
You're here now.

345
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.160
I rarely leave this place.

346
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.960
I actually… Never mind.

347
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.320
Can we have bread?

348
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.720
Never mind what?

349
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.240
Tell me.

350
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.040
I don't really leave this place. I mean…

351
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.720
I haven't left here for too long.
Last time was to your store.

352
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.280
How do you like it outside?

353
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.120
I don't know.

354
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.360
Let's see the tower.

355
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.560
What tower?

356
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.560
I've heard there's a tower
overlooking the city

357
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.520
that is not known by many.

358
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.520
And how should I know about it?

359
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.000
I just thought you might.

360
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.160
Did someone tell you about it?
What's it like? How do we get there?

361
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.840
Is there anyone else who knows about it?

362
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.760
There should be.

363
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.680
They just can't let me be.

364
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.000
I should go.

365
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.440
I couldn't finish it.

366
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.320
Thanks anyway.

367
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.960
I'm glad your hand is okay.

368
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.360
See you.

369
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.720
-Hello?
-Gökçe. where are you?

370
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.880
On my way.

371
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.360
Please come home right away.

372
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.360
Is there something wrong?

373
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.880
We're waiting for you.

374
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.920
They're just games. They're not real.

375
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.920
Go to your room now.

376
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.840
-Give me my Game Boy. then.
-No Game Boy for you. Go to your room.

377
00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.720
Sweetie?

378
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.440
-What happened?
-Ege got into a fight at school today.

379
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.040
It's not just any fight.

380
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.480
He bit a kid's ear.

381
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.360
He got stitches.
His mother showed up at school.

382
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.520
She obviously complained about Ege.

383
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.920
The principal was mad.
There'd been other complaints too.

384
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.440
They couldn't reach you. They called me.
I had to drop everything and go.

385
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.240
How is Ege?

386
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.440
At the school. I found out
this was not the first time.

387
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.120
They think Ege has anger issues.

388
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.360
I didn't know what to do.

389
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.240
Lale helped out. Bless her.

390
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.240
Where were you?

391
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.800
How is the other kid?
Is there anything we can do?

392
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.040
No. dear. We spoke to the family.

393
00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.760
We did it all. All that needed to be done.

394
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.520
Don't worry. You weren't at the boutique.

395
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.120
Where were you. Gökçe?

396
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.000
-Out running errands.
-Why didn't you answer your phone?

397
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.120
I didn't hear it.

398
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.680
You can't just not hear it.
You must be reachable!

399
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240
You must!

400
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.280
-Call me if anything happens.
-Okay.

401
00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.800
Kenan. It's my stomach.

402
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.560
This may help.

403
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.440
Kenan. please!

404
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.560
Hi. darling. Will you be finished early
at the boutique today?

405
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.200
Okay. I may go directly to the restaurant.
I may not be able to pick you up.

406
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.920
Okay. see you there tonight.
Please don't be late.

407
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.120
Are we gonna cover the other windows too?

408
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.120
Let me finish this one first.

409
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.520
It turned out nice. huh?

410
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.320
Yes. I was skeptical
about the colors at first.

411
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.800
but as a whole. it looks good.

412
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.880
That big window in the back.
what do you say we cover that too?

413
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.800
Sure.

414
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.480
-Should I put this book in the back?
-Give me that.

415
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.440
I skimmed through it. Looks interesting.

416
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.120
What do you mean? Did you read it?

417
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.680
No. I didn't read it.
I just leafed through it.

418
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.000
Why are you going through my stuff?

419
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.520
I was curious.
But believe me. I didn't read it.

420
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.680
How much did you read?

421
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.360
Just the beginning.

422
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.120
Greetings.

423
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.960
Thank you.

424
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.280
I brought the mirror.

425
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.400
I'll move on to the windows in the back.

426
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.600
You want to see the tower?

427
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.200
I do.

428
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.720
On one condition.

429
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.240
-Do you know her?
-No.

430
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.480
She glared at us.

431
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.320
With every step.
my heart began pounding faster.

432
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.720
I stopped on the last step.
I was about to lose my nerve.

433
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.200
The door to a new world stood before me.

434
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.800
My hand shrank in his hand
and melted away.

435
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.480
What lay beyond the door
was probably even better.

436
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.240
I'm ready now.

437
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.160
I've walked around here before.
I know this place.

438
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.160
How? You've never been here.

439
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.560
I guess my mind wandered
around here before.

440
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.600
Who was with you?

441
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.440
No one.

442
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.760
No one knows this place but me.

443
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.120
Who drew those drawings downstairs?

444
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.720
Maybe you did.

445
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.280
Once more!

446
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.760
It's high up here.

447
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.800
How did you hear about this place?

448
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.280
I just did.

449
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.120
You must've heard about it somewhere.

450
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.160
That was the condition.
We made a promise. We'd tell each other.

451
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.960
They were talking about it at the bakery.

452
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.600
The bakery.

453
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.280
We both know that's not true.

454
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.000
You wouldn't believe it.

455
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.600
Believe what?

456
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.240
I saw this place.

457
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.200
It was as if through someone else's mind.

458
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.280
Like a dream.

459
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.360
You mean like destiny?

460
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080
Maybe.

461
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.320
Do we have to see a place to know it?

462
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.520
The sun is going down.

463
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.200
Let it go down.

464
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.200
It's time.

465
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.120
Where are you going?

466
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.800
How many have you published this season?

467
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.080
Half as many as last year. I guess.

468
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.760
We didn't publish too many
this season either.

469
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.160
The market size of digital publishing is
constantly growing. that's why.

470
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.920
-Mr. Kenan. good to see you. How are you?
-Same here. Thanks.

471
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

472
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080
Thank you.

473
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.120
I came here after a meeting.

474
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.760
We should call Mr. Cemal.

475
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.280
Sure. I'm calling him now.

476
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.000
I guess everyone's here.

477
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.480
I'll share a secret with you.

478
00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.120
Ready?

479
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.960
GRAND HOTEL ISTANBUL

480
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.320
RESTAURANT

481
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.960
I light up this city.

482
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440
What are you doing?

483
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.480
It'll be good during these busy days.

484
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.200
Your wife's coming. right?

485
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.320
Yes. she's probably stuck in traffic.
Excuse me.

486
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.920
How are you? How is work going?

487
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.520
-We had fun.
-How is the kid?

488
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.960
So you light it up every night?

489
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.240
Not every night.

490
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.960
I'd love to change everything right now.

491
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.200
Myself. my life.

492
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.360
The whole world.

493
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.120
Wouldn't you want that?

494
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.440
Maybe I did want that.

495
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.800
Maybe I did.

496
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.040
Where were you?

497
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.600
Here I am.

498
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.520
Where were you. Gökçe?

499
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.760
I was here.

500
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.840
I won't forget what you did tonight.

501
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.400
I won't forget it either.

502
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.000
You're mocking me. Get a hold of yourself.

503
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.280
No. I'm not mocking you at all.

504
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.680
You knew about the dinner
and didn't show up.

505
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.920
You didn't have your phone with you.
You embarrassed me!

506
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.360
You weren't embarrassed. Kenan.

507
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.200
Your shadow wasn't with you. that's all.

508
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.120
What?

509
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.200
What's all the noise? I can't sleep.

510
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.040
Nothing. son. It's nothing.

511
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.360
Gökçe. what's going on?

512
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.320
I'm coming. love.

513
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.280
I'd say orange.
It would look great on you.

514
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.040
I'll go with blue.

515
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.360
-As you wish.
-What are those over there?

516
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.560
Hi. Mr. Kenan.

517
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.400
-Hi. Ceylan. Gökçe's not here?
-She left early.

518
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.800
Can I help you?

519
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720
I just dropped by.

520
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.280
Are these new?

521
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.480
Yes. Ms. Gökçe wanted some changes.

522
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.840
We ordered a mirror. but it isn't up yet.
The carpenter is in Balat.

523
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.040
Balat? Why?

524
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.760
I guess she got the idea
from the book she was reading.

525
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.160
Which book?

526
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.800
I think it's called Ashes.

527
00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.840
Okay. Have a good one.

528
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.320
What time will Gökçe be back?

529
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.560
I think she's left for the day.

530
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.760
Okay. Have a nice day.

531
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.960
Why are you around here with that woman?

532
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.080
How dare you question me?

533
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.320
Does she know you're married?

534
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.200
What we have is nonsense. Are we married?

535
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.000
On paper. yes.

536
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.240
You need to be careful
until we're divorced. or else I know how--

537
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.680
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

538
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.640
Everyone pays for their own sins.

539
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.680
Be aware of your weaknesses
before you cross the line.

540
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.560
What was that?

541
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.120
What was what?

542
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.480
What just happened?

543
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.360
Nothing. It's not important.

544
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.200
You told me you weren't married.

545
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.400
Are you questioning me? About what?

546
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.280
Aren't you married?

547
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.120
-I want an explanation.
-For what?

548
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.600
You've been lying!

549
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.680
About what? What are you talking about?

550
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.800
-You said you didn't know her!
-Who?

551
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.960
When she walked past us. I asked you
who she was. and you said you didn't know!

552
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.040
You're the one who's been lying!
The one who is married!

553
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.960
How do you know the tower?
Tell me! I don't know you. Who are you?

554
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.280
Who are you? Huh?

555
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.600
-You tell me!
-Who are you? I want…

556
00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.640
Who are you. huh?

557
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.960
-Who are you?
-I'll…

558
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.880
-Who are you?
-You…

559
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.960
-Hey!
-Who are you? Huh?

560
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.800
Who?

561
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.920
My dad demanded that I marry Büşra.

562
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.080
The business was failing. and he was ill.

563
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.800
They were in some trade business together.
and we were collateral damage.

564
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.640
I've never slept with Büşra.

565
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.240
She knew I didn't love her.

566
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.160
After my dad died. I asked for a divorce.

567
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.240
She said no and moved out.
Then all hell broke loose.

568
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.560
One day. her older brother showed up.
He barely escaped with his life.

569
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.000
I am done with them.

570
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.240
You haven't eaten.

571
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.080
I'm not hungry.

572
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.800
May I have Ashes? Are you done?

573
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680
I'm not done.

574
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.040
It shouldn't be taking this long.

575
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.560
I have to get back to people about it.

576
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.920
The sooner you finish it. the better.

577
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.560
The last meal the three of us had
left a taste of betrayal in our mouths.

578
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.200
M and R. I finally made you
confront each other.

579
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.880
The bitter taste of death

580
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.160
took over my body as we set the table.

581
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.520
M killed me.

582
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.520
He couldn't save me this time.

583
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.720
All that was left of love
was a handful of ashes.

584
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.800
"…took over my body as we set the table."

585
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.760
"M killed me.
He couldn't save me this time."

586
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.760
He killed her.

587
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.320
Everything in the book
turned out to be real.

588
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.960
For example?

589
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.040
Everything. The tower. the bakery. Balat.

590
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.720
M. Metin. Him being married. All of it.

591
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.440
Okay. but this is a book. It's fiction.

592
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.520
I mean. it's all made up. right?

593
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.600
The people and places may be coincidental.

594
01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.880
I'm telling you. I lived it all.
It was all real. I felt all of it.

595
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.120
I lived all of it.

596
01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.360
Yeah. but if everything in here is true.
and she's dead.

597
01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.040
how did she write the book?

598
01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.160
You're not even listening to me.

599
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.120
You were cuddled up with a man
in the middle of Nişantaşı

600
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.840
in a ridiculous car.

601
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.840
I know what I saw.

602
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.240
Have you still not married that book guy?

603
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.560
What do you mean
you don't wanna get married?

604
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.120
Get married and settle down.

605
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.920
Take my advice.

606
01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.920
Trust me. You'll have a very happy life.

607
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.680
I've finished it.
It's not worth publishing.

608
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.520
You didn't like it?

609
01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.200
It's overdramatic and exaggerated.

610
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.040
And the ending's just dull.

611
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.200
The idea is cool. but the writing is poor.

612
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.640
If you know who the author is.
I'd like to talk to them.

613
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.040
I'll ask about it.

614
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.760
…in return. only sadness…

615
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.640
With a broken heart…

616
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.280
…took over my body as we set the table…

617
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.760
ASHES

618
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.000
M - CAN'T MEET FOR THREE DAYS.
TOO BUSY. I'LL CALL YOU.

619
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.280
We couldn't find the author.

620
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.320
How come? Who sent it?

621
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.720
I don't know.
We're looking into it. We're baffled too.

622
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.840
Someone must've sent it.

623
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.200
Did it fall from the sky?

624
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.520
It probably came with the others.

625
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.560
They're all registered
with contact info for each.

626
01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.760
But nothing on Ashes.

627
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.080
A courier delivered it. right?

628
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.560
Then ask all the courier companies.
That's how we'll track it.

629
01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.960
Sure. we're on it.

630
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.640
Where is Metin?

631
01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.320
-Where is Metin?
-Who?

632
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.600
-Ali.
-He went to the farmers market.

633
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.000
-You want directions?
-No need.

634
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.360
Hot bread!

635
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.800
Bread!

636
01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.560
Can you tell them that I no longer…

637
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.280
Yes. ma'am?

638
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.360
-The peppers.
-I got them.

639
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.360
Here.

640
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.040
Shall we go talk?

641
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.920
Just say what you have to say.

642
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.120
-Gökçe.
-Who were those people?

643
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.160
No one.

644
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.680
What are you hiding from me?

645
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.680
Hiding? This has nothing to do with you.
Don't you worry. It's work.

646
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.400
How many women are there?

647
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.520
What? What's going on with you?

648
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.840
Look. I have to learn
everything about you. okay?

649
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.560
This is not just some fling for me.

650
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.680
I'm becoming attached to you.

651
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.800
Don't. Don't get attached to me.

652
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.360
Just don't.

653
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.640
Don't push me away.

654
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.080
You're pushing me away.

655
01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.280
I'm losing my way.

656
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.040
I'm not pushing anybody away.
and I am not running away.

657
01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.720
Look…

658
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.760
I'm in no position
to show anybody the way.

659
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.760
Gökçe. what is this?

660
01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320
Calm down.

661
01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.760
Gökçe. what are you doing?

662
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.800
Hey. Gökçe. For God's sake.

663
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.480
What's wrong with you?

664
01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.840
Whenever I close my eyes…

665
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.080
I'm on that tower.

666
01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.040
It's like a cliff.

667
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.400
I want to scream.

668
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440
I have no voice.

669
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.600
I don't even know my name.

670
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.800
I don't know my name.

671
01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.640
The reality of what I've been through…

672
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.480
It's blurry.

673
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.920
I mix everything up.

674
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.840
Gökçe. what are you doing?

675
01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.000
Keep that on.

676
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.680
We found the address it was sent from.

677
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.320
It was sent a year ago
and delivered by an unknown courier.

678
01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.480
Reyhan Akkaya lives at that address.

679
01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.840
Send me the address.

680
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.240
Sure.

681
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.360
Yes?

682
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.480
Hi. You must be Ms. Reyhan.

683
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.640
I'm the owner of Urkan Publishing.
Kenan Urkan.

684
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.160
Sorry to show up unannounced.

685
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.160
I want to talk to you
about the book you sent us.

686
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.280
Sorry. what book?

687
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.320
Ashes.

688
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.720
I don't know about any book.
You must be mistaken.

689
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.880
The book was sent from this address.

690
01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.440
About a year ago.

691
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.040
Do you live here alone?

692
01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.520
Yes.

693
01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.840
But were you living alone a year ago?

694
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.400
No. I mean.
my older sister was with me. but…

695
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.560
Can I please talk to your sister?

696
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.760
You can't because we lost her.

697
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.240
My condolences.
I guess this is my mistake.

698
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.240
What was her name?

699
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.480
Duygu Akkaya. You got the wrong address.

700
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.080
Look. I know how your sister died.

701
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.200
It's likely that she wrote the book.

702
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.160
I don't think so.

703
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.840
It's a love story
between a carpenter named M and a woman.

704
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.960
At the end of the book.
she claims the carpenter will kill her.

705
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.160
If you have doubts about her death.
this may be used to report a crime.

706
01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.800
I have no doubts.

707
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.840
I told the police everything back then.

708
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.600
-İlyas. go inside.
-I can bring the rest.

709
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.040
Just go inside.

710
01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.880
Why are you here?

711
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.680
-First. calm down.
-I can't. How dare you come here?

712
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.720
I'm no fan of seeing you either.
Wait. A man came by.

713
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.680
-Who?
-I don't know. Duygu's--

714
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.360
Don't mention her name
or remind me of her. I want to forget.

715
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.000
-She wrote about you. Balat. your love.
-Are you here to drive me mad?

716
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.320
-She wrote about her own death.
-What is this nonsense?

717
01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.680
Don't dig up the past.

718
01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.120
Her own death! And who knows what else.

719
01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.600
Don't come here again!

720
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.560
Otherwise. things will get ugly.

721
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.840
What's that look?

722
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.640
I found the author.

723
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.920
A woman.

724
01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.240
Her name is Duygu Akkaya.

725
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.200
It's kind of sad.

726
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.840
She died.

727
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.760
Or someone caused her death.

728
01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.080
Strange. isn't it?

729
01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.160
She wrote about her death.

730
01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.320
She almost predicted it.

731
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.640
Staff at the publishing house
found her sister's number.

732
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.520
Ege?

733
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.360
Duygu.

734
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.920
How did she die?

735
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.880
Was she strangled? Was she shot? How?

736
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.760
I don't know.

737
01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.720
I hope she didn't suffer much.

738
01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.680
You can find out for yourself.
Here's her sister's address.

739
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.240
Excuse me.

740
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.960
-Do you live here?
-Yes.

741
01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.960
I came to see a friend in apartment 10.
I rang the bell. but no one answered.

742
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.200
You mean Reyhan. I heard she moved out.
Packed up and left abruptly.

743
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.760
-Do you know where she moved to?
-I don't.

744
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.760
She had a sister?

745
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.280
Yes. Duygu. We lost her last year.

746
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.720
So I heard. Do you know how she died?

747
01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.800
Some said it was a suicide.

748
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.440
Others claimed a man entered
the house that day. That's all.

749
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.400
-Hi.
-Hi there.

750
01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.400
How can I help you?

751
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.840
I need a good carpenter.
I heard about you.

752
01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.880
What do you need?

753
01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.480
A bookcase for my office.

754
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.000
Will do. I'll be right back.

755
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.080
No problem. What do you have in mind?

756
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:27.160
Nothing too big.
A modern bookcase in wood color.

757
01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
Okay. Give me the measurements.

758
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.760
Price is not a concern.

759
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.000
I just need it quickly.

760
01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.160
I can get it to you next week.

761
01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.200
That's too late.

762
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.200
It's about the time. not the money.

763
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.400
But I can build something
with what I already have.

764
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.920
That's fine.

765
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.920
Okay. Anything else?

766
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.880
I'll write down the address.

767
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.440
Why are you following me?

768
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.040
You know Duygu Akkaya?

769
01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.840
Metin might have committed a crime.

770
01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.560
Yes. he did.

771
01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.080
It's a major crime that he's seeing you.

772
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.880
This is not the first time.

773
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.520
This is all being documented
up there somewhere.

774
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.640
You're an accomplice now.

775
01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.520
I really don't care about what you think.

776
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.000
Is that so?

777
01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.360
You understand that the written word
governs our lives.

778
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.520
Allah is great.

779
01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.360
This is my first and last warning.

780
01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.280
If you're smart.
you'll stay away from this neighborhood.

781
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.520
You shouldn't have.

782
01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.360
Nonsense. We can't let you leave hungry.

783
01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.560
Have you ever been around here?

784
01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.760
It's my first time.

785
01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.520
This is your first time. huh?

786
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.520
It is.

787
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.880
Are you married?

788
01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.240
I'm not.

789
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.520
Have you ever been married?

790
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.160
Yes. I have.

791
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.040
It didn't work out?

792
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.440
Well. it's all in the past now.

793
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.440
I'm past that. Forget it.

794
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.200
Welcome. darling.

795
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.280
Come. dinner is ready.
And we have a guest.

796
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.920
What do you think?

797
01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.440
You had a mirror made for the boutique.
That's how I found him.

798
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.800
My wife. Gökçe.

799
01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.440
He's done an amazing job. right?

800
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.000
The meat is ready.

801
01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.240
Go ahead and sit.
I'm coming. He will eat with us.

802
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.240
I'm done here.
I'll pack my things and head out.

803
01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.560
Come on. No way.
I said we won't let you leave hungry.

804
01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.440
Gökçe?

805
01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240
Hey.

806
01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.600
I'll leave this here.

807
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.320
I didn't need it.

808
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.600
Thanks.

809
01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.800
Do you read?

810
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.240
I don't have time.

811
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.440
It's our job.
Gökçe does most of the reading.

812
01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.280
Right. Gökçe?

813
01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.600
One should read.

814
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.640
Even a book that was written centuries ago

815
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.040
can still touch people.

816
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:24.920
Think about it.

817
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.400
Back in the day.

818
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.080
girls were not allowed
to read romance novels.

819
01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.600
Why?

820
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.400
So that they wouldn't get carried away.

821
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.080
Like with Don Quixote.

822
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:47.560
Back then. people poured into the streets.
thinking they were knights.

823
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.840
It will get cold.

824
01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.480
Have you ever heard about fictophilia?

825
01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.320
Taner told us about it. remember?

826
01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.000
-It's an interesting illness.
-Where is Ege?

827
01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.440
In his room. darling.

828
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.880
I took his food to him. Don't worry.

829
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.000
The state of falling in love
with a fictional character.

830
01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.680
The WHO does not consider it an illness.

831
01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.000
but if you ask me.
it's a serious disorder.

832
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.040
Thanks for dinner.

833
01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.120
-Good night.
-Gökçe discovered a new author.

834
01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.840
Duygu Akkaya.

835
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.040
How do you know her?
How do you know Duygu?

836
01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.560
Duygu is the author of this book.

837
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.040
And she talks about you
in this book as well.

838
01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.160
What the hell are you talking about?

839
01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.680
It's just a book.

840
01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.600
Just a book. huh?

841
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.360
Go on.

842
01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.720
Maybe Gökçe would like to go on.

843
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.240
Okay. then I'll go on.

844
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.280
The main character in this book is M.

845
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.200
Duygu. the author of the book.
falls in love with this M.

846
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.920
And she chases after him
even though she knows she'll die.

847
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.000
Here's the part that concerns you.

848
01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.720
This M is a carpenter in Balat.

849
01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.720
And he's married.

850
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.240
He meets Duygu.

851
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.560
He makes her fall obsessively
in love with him.

852
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.080
then he sleeps with her sister.

853
01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.600
Whose story is this?

854
01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.760
It's your story.

855
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.520
Aren't you the M in the book?

856
01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.000
Wait a minute. What's your problem?

857
01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.160
What the hell is your problem?

858
01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.000
This is one of my favorite parts.

859
01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.680
"The only person
I let in on my secret was M."

860
01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.720
"A piece of me. my blood. R."

861
01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.920
"The sum of their lies
adds up to a betrayal…"

862
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.840
There's no such thing!

863
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.680
You planted seeds of betrayal
between sisters who loved each other.

864
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.920
A perfect turn of fate. right?
You like that.

865
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.440
Neither Reyhan nor I betrayed Duygu.

866
01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.280
Duygu was obsessed with me. That's all.

867
01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.760
Fine. is this a lie too?
Give it to me. Gökçe.

868
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.240
Please.

869
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.120
Please.

870
01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.720
Yes. here it is.

871
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.360
"The last meal the three of us had
left a taste of betrayal in our mouths."

872
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.080
"M and R. I finally made you
confront each other."

873
01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.240
Why did she do that?
Because you two had slept together?

874
01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.440
Watch your mouth. or I'll fuck you up!

875
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.320
I'm not saying a thing. It's in the book.

876
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.760
Do you know anything other than books?

877
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.280
Do you know about life in the real world?
Tell him about it.

878
01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.120
You know what? Gökçe is unaware of
what's true and what's a lie.

879
01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.520
Gökçe found you thanks to this book.

880
01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:48.320
She read this book
and wanted to live what's written in it.

881
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.240
That's how you found me?

882
01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.280
It was all real.

883
01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:02.040
Real? For fuck's sake!
Are we just a game to you? Huh?

884
01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.960
Did you kill her?

885
01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:10.880
What?

886
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.680
We'll change this story now.

887
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.880
Your history with Duygu and Reyhan.

888
01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.360
any clues Gökçe followed.

889
01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.840
and any trace of Gökçe whatsoever
will turn to ash.

890
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.880
There's one thing we can't change.

891
01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.440
The fact that you killed Duygu.

892
01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.800
Do you know how many times
she attempted suicide?

893
01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.840
How many meds she was on?

894
01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.880
What happened when she skipped her meds?

895
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.680
-Do you even know? What do you know?
-Let go!

896
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.080
How many times she attempted suicide?

897
01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.200
-Let go!
-You don't know Duygu!

898
01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.680
You don't fucking know Duygu!

899
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.520
You don't know Duygu!

900
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.520
Gökçe. call the police!

901
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.080
What is reality. and what is fiction?

902
01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.920
We need to think about it.

903
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.800
I think life is fooling us all.

904
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.280
Reality could be a lie
that someone made up. don't you think?

905
01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.080
Maybe we're all living
in someone else's dream.

906
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:51.320
Yes. Go ahead.

907
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.640
She commits suicide
by throwing herself under a train.

908
01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.760
Did you mean to combine
another novel character with yours?

909
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.240
Yes. That similarity was intentional.

910
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.840
I can't think of a more striking ending
than killing oneself like Anna Karenina.

911
01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.040
And this ending is a salute
to the grand master Tolstoy.

912
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.200
You. sir.

913
01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.160
This book isn't like your previous ones.
How was the process?

914
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.000
What sources did you draw on?

915
01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.920
I realized I was writing
too much about myself.

916
01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.840
One day. I told myself.

917
01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.640
"Taner. please.
It's time you try something different

918
01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.080
and stop writing about your own life."

919
01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.280
Imagine infiltrating someone else's mind.

920
01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.400
Seeing life through their eyes.

921
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.160
That's how Ashes was born.

922
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.240
Thanks. Thank you all for coming.
