00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:30.600
Is there another pilot on the manifest?

690
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:31.852
What should I do?

691
00:38:31.935 --> 00:38:33.603
I need you to talk him down.

692
00:38:33.687 --> 00:38:35.313
What? I don't understand.

693
00:38:36.023 --> 00:38:37.399
Uh. why me?

694
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:41.361
Move these aircraft
away from the King Air.

695
00:38:41.445 --> 00:38:44.031
Get Fort Myers on the phone.
Let's try and divert him there.

696
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.243
0-6-1. contact Miami Approach. 133.77.

697
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:52.289
American Nine-Lima-Lima.
contact Miami Approach. 120.5.

698
00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:56.543
American Nine-Lima-Lima.
contact Miami Approach. 120.5.

699
00:38:56.626 --> 00:38:57.711
How far is that from us?

700
00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:00.547
Can't be more than 50 miles.
They lost the pilot?

701
00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:02.424
Who's flying the plane?

702
00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:05.802
I don't know. If he tries to land here.
I don't wanna see the results.

703
00:39:10.766 --> 00:39:12.434
[Maggie] Mom. what's happening?

704
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.187
Yeah. Yeah. I found the manual.

705
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.065
- Good. See if you can find a picture.
- Right. I'll try.

706
00:39:18.148 --> 00:39:19.691
- Of the instruments.
- Yeah.

707
00:39:19.775 --> 00:39:21.401
- Tell what everything is.
- Confused.

708
00:39:21.485 --> 00:39:25.155
Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
are you able to maintain 12.000?

709
00:39:25.238 --> 00:39:27.074
That's 12.000 feet.

710
00:39:27.157 --> 00:39:32.204
Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
I don't know if my autopilot is on or not.

711
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:36.458
I am in a steady climb. but my altimeter…

712
00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:39.002
My altitude just keeps going up.

713
00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:40.796
I don't know. but. uh…

714
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:43.548
Should I try to level off?

715
00:39:43.632 --> 00:39:45.050
You think autopilot is on?

716
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:49.221
- There's a button there. It says "A-P."
- My wife found a switch.

717
00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:52.599
Uh. I believe it's the autopilot.

718
00:39:52.682 --> 00:39:54.142
[stammering]

719
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:57.270
- I believe it's on.
- Fort Myers Approach. Fort Myers Low.

720
00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:59.689
[man] Fort Myers Approach. Fort Myers Low.

721
00:39:59.773 --> 00:40:02.400
Fort Myers Approach.
I have full-on emergency.

722
00:40:02.484 --> 00:40:03.485
State your emergency.

723
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:07.572
King Air Niner-Delta-Whiskey
has an unconscious pilot.

724
00:40:07.656 --> 00:40:09.324
He needs help. Can you assist?

725
00:40:10.325 --> 00:40:13.203
Ralph. I need your assist on this one.
We got an emergency.

726
00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:17.624
Tower supervisor. What's your emergency?

727
00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:33.390
What's wrong? What's the emergency?

728
00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:35.475
Don't have an emergency.
I'm listening to one.

729
00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:37.644
- [Ralph] Delta-Whiskey. I got it.
- Who's that?

730
00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:40.272
Air traffic chatter. Dead pilot on board.

731
00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:42.315
No way. How do you know?

732
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.403
[Donna] These are all the planes.
we're following this one.

733
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:49.531
Dad showed me how to use it.
I track him when he's flying.

734
00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:52.450
- This is happening right now?
- Yeah. with a slight delay.

735
00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:54.744
- And somebody's about to crash?
- It's possible.

736
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:59.040
And we're gonna hear everything?
That's. like. messed up.

737
00:40:59.124 --> 00:41:01.960
[Doug] It's all I can do
to push this thing.

738
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:03.712
It's heavy. What do I do?

739
00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:07.299
[Bill] King Air Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
I'm here. Don't worry.

740
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:08.982
You hear that? He's gonna keep climbing.

741
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.760
might get too high. run out of oxygen.

742
00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:12.095
They gotta level him out.

743
00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:15.724
Here.

744
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:18.602
You can use this laptop
to track the plane.

745
00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:21.438
The tail number is N-5-5-9-D-W.

746
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:23.064
but they'll say Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

747
00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:24.691
That's how you know it's this plane.

748
00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:26.151
What? Why?

749
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:27.944
They talk fast. Use less words.

750
00:41:28.028 --> 00:41:29.821
They're talking to thousands of planes.

751
00:41:29.905 --> 00:41:31.156
Okay. this is...

752
00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:33.825
This is crazy. How do you know this?

753
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.577
I'm gonna be a pilot one day.

754
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.913
Okay. why?

755
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:41.708
Because one time after science class.
Mr. Jones told me I couldn't.

756
00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:46.880
Listen. I already busted 10.000.

757
00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:48.465
I am steady climbing.

758
00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:50.884
I need to stop this climb.

759
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.594
I need help.

760
00:41:53.595 --> 00:41:56.514
If we turn the autopilot off.
that might stop the climb?

761
00:41:56.598 --> 00:41:57.807
Miami. are you with me?

762
00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:00.602
Miami. are you still with me?

763
00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:03.104
Okay. November-Five-Five-
Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

764
00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:06.983
when you look at the center console there.
you don't see "autopilot"?

765
00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:09.945
[Doug] The switch in the middle
of the panel is on.

766
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.988
Do you want me to turn it off?

767
00:42:12.072 --> 00:42:15.075
November-Five-Delta-Whiskey. that's fine.

768
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.285
Disengage the autopilot.

769
00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:19.246
We're gonna have you hand-fly the plane.

770
00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:22.791
Okay.

771
00:42:24.376 --> 00:42:27.879
Hold the yoke level.
and disengage the autopilot.

772
00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:30.340
[automated voice] Caution.

773
00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:33.134
- Mom. what is that? What's going on?
- Manual. Caution.

774
00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:34.302
All right.

775
00:42:35.387 --> 00:42:36.721
I turned it off.

776
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.768
Just me and the Good Lord
flying the airplane.

777
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:43.853
Have you ever piloted a plane before. sir?

778
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:46.273
One discovery flight.

779
00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:52.529
Ma'am. you find me the longest
and the widest runway you can.

780
00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:57.367
He won't make it. The difference in
this plane and a Cessna is night and day.

781
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.577
- Lisa. we have to...
- It's a suicide mission.

782
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:01.746
That may be the case. but we gotta try.

783
00:43:08.169 --> 00:43:10.088
Is there anything I can do to help?

784
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.467
Bow your head.

785
00:43:14.551 --> 00:43:17.512
Put your hands on the instrument panel.

786
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:23.059
- Dear Lord. please send us some angels.
- No. That's not for praying.

787
00:43:23.143 --> 00:43:26.021
Terri. that's the impact position.

788
00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:27.564
- It'll come to that?
- Be ready.

789
00:43:27.647 --> 00:43:30.692
- Stay positive!
- Miami. you gotta stay with me.

790
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.403
My wife and daughters are on this plane.

791
00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:34.612
We need help.

792
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.575
Hold the plane level.

793
00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:41.161
You are doing pretty good.

794
00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:45.540
17.000. Just try to keep
the plane level at 17.000.

795
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:49.210
I just started speaking
Air Traffic Control just a few days ago

796
00:43:49.294 --> 00:43:52.172
so if you could just speak
a little slower.

797
00:43:52.255 --> 00:43:54.049
and in English…

798
00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:56.593
Roger that.

799
00:43:56.676 --> 00:43:58.511
I mean. sure thing.

800
00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:02.807
Fly the plane straight at 17.000 feet.

801
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:05.602
Now. that I can do.

802
00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:09.981
Move these planes out of his way.
I need it clear.

803
00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:13.568
Circus 86. contact Miami Approach. 133.17.

804
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.528
[pilot] Circus 86. copy.

805
00:44:15.612 --> 00:44:17.864
[Lisa] Okay. November-Five-Delta-Whiskey.

806
00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:21.242
just start a slow. shallow descent.

807
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:24.287
Just ease down on the yoke.
Slight descent.

808
00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:26.331
We're gonna go to 11.000.

809
00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:30.627
Pull back on the throttle slightly.
and just ease over the yoke.

810
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.711
Gently.

811
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.759
We're gonna try a nice. shallow.
500-feet-per-minute descent.

812
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:39.302
One moment.

813
00:44:39.386 --> 00:44:42.389
Those are the same two levers to the left?

814
00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:43.973
- [Lisa] Yes.
- All right.

815
00:44:45.475 --> 00:44:46.476
All right.

816
00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:49.562
Pull it back.
Okay. there. It's going down.

817
00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:54.943
[keyboard clacking]

818
00:44:57.779 --> 00:44:59.948
He's supposed to be flying
a straight line.

819
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.492
He's going up and down. left and right.

820
00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:04.828
So. is he going down?

821
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:06.955
Look at all the planes
moving out of his way.

822
00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:10.166
He might actually die.

823
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.379
This is. like. so bad.

824
00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:19.467
[Lisa] November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
so you know what we're doing.

825
00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:23.138
we're gonna get you down to 11.000.
give you a turn to the west.

826
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:26.891
That's 11.000 feet.
I reckon. ma'am. Right?

827
00:45:26.975 --> 00:45:28.685
Yes. sir. That's correct.

828
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:31.855
Sorry about the jargon.
Second nature for me.

829
00:45:31.938 --> 00:45:34.023
This is my first rodeo. ma'am.

830
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:37.652
so if you're losing me.
I'm gonna let you know.

831
00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:39.654
Roger that.

832
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:40.989
[Ellis] Lisa.

833
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:43.074
All right. Bring her to 132.07…

834
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.535
We're gonna hand you off
to Fort Myers Approach.

835
00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:48.163
They got controllers with pilot experience

836
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.165
and they're gonna take their time

837
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:52.500
and talk you all the way
into the landing there.

838
00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:54.043
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

839
00:45:54.127 --> 00:45:56.963
Wait a minute.
You're gonna hand me off to someone else?

840
00:45:57.547 --> 00:45:58.798
[Lisa] That's affirmative.

841
00:45:58.882 --> 00:46:00.925
You'll be crossing into their airspace.

842
00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:03.678
These are good people.
We've got you. okay?

843
00:46:04.846 --> 00:46:07.807
I understand this can be stressful.
but we're here for you.

844
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:10.977
We see everything in your path
much further than you can imagine.

845
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.147
All you gotta do is just keep on
flying the plane

846
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.899
perfectly like you're doing right now.

847
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:19.110
- We'll get you through this.
- [Bailey] What are they saying?

848
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:20.528
- Can you hear them?
- Well…

849
00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:23.114
you're all we've got.

850
00:46:23.198 --> 00:46:26.409
So. roger. Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

851
00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:29.162
Doug.
I'm looking for the emergency procedures.

852
00:46:29.746 --> 00:46:31.498
No doubt we're gonna need them.

853
00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:36.628
Has anyone seen Brian?

854
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:39.797
A plane took off from Marco Island.
Dead pilot on board.

855
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:41.799
- You're kidding.
- They're sending him here.

856
00:46:41.883 --> 00:46:44.886
Have you ever flown a King Air?
Anyone have hours in a King Air?

857
00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:48.473
Brian's shift just got over.
You might catch him in the parking lot.

858
00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:52.602
- I... I might be able to make a phone call.
- I've got it.

859
00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:58.608
Uh. no. I've never had
a Spam and broccoli casserole. [chuckling]

860
00:46:58.691 --> 00:47:01.319
But. well. I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

861
00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:06.115
I'll be happy to make
my special corn bread.

862
00:47:08.618 --> 00:47:09.744
Hey! Brian!

863
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:13.081
Wait! Brian!

864
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.669
- [brakes screech]
- [Ralph grunts]

865
00:47:18.795 --> 00:47:19.796
What?

866
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.175
[Ralph groans]

867
00:47:24.968 --> 00:47:26.719
Ralph. What are you doing?

868
00:47:27.303 --> 00:47:28.972
We got…

869
00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:30.682
We got an emergency inside.

870
00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:32.225
We need you. Come on.

871
00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:33.768
- Let me move my truck.
- Go.

872
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.982
They're bringing him here to Fort Myers.
They're bringing him here!

873
00:47:39.065 --> 00:47:41.568
Oh. whoa. Aren't we. like.
pretty close to the airport?

874
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.988
[airplane passing overhead]

875
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.907
Too close.
They'll probably turn him out west.

876
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:50.493
Over the ocean.

877
00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:52.453
[Buggy] Why?

878
00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:54.455
I saw this in an airplane documentary.

879
00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:57.542
If he drops. he won't kill anybody.

880
00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:01.212
Except the people on the plane.

881
00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:11.514
[engine sputtering]

882
00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:13.266
Come on.

883
00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:24.569
[Brian] All right. what do we got?

884
00:48:26.195 --> 00:48:28.114
Do you need me to redirect or anything?

885
00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:34.287
[cell phone vibrating]

886
00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:42.545
Well. well. my man. Dan.

887
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:44.964
What's going on. brother?

888
00:48:45.048 --> 00:48:47.884
Kari. listen.
I need your help. I'm at work.

889
00:48:47.967 --> 00:48:51.262
I'm in the control room at Fort Myers.
There's a guy flying a plane.

890
00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:53.973
You're calling me from the
control room on a cell phone?

891
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:55.642
Yeah.

892
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:01.189
[sighs] Okay.

893
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:04.817
Kari?

894
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:10.990
[cell phone vibrating]

895
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:17.872
Hello. Hey. Dan. Yeah. he's right here.

896
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:19.082
He's all yours.

897
00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:21.751
- I forgot my keys.
- Can't talk to him right now.

898
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:24.545
Seems he doesn't wanna
communicate with you either.

899
00:49:26.047 --> 00:49:27.090
Take it.

900
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:32.720
Have you lost your mind.
or trying to get me arrested?

901
00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:35.515
Kari. listen. I'm at work.
I need your help.

902
00:49:36.057 --> 00:49:38.101
I'm in the control room.
and there's a guy...

903
00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:40.311
It's illegal to use a cell phone in there.

904
00:49:40.395 --> 00:49:42.105
- Listen!
- If I'm on that call...

905
00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:44.148
I need you to stop a plane crash.

906
00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:47.360
- What?
- There's a plane to Fort Myers.

907
00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:48.444
Pilot's dead.

908
00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:51.531
passenger's flying but no one here
has hours in that type of aircraft.

909
00:49:55.952 --> 00:49:56.994
What's going on?

910
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.748
[Dan] Kari. we need your help.
There's a family on board.

911
00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:03.042
I'm sure right about now
they're scared senseless.

912
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.006
Kari.

913
00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:10.717
we need you. buddy.

914
00:50:11.843 --> 00:50:15.763
Look… [stammers]
…I don't know if I can do this.

915
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:22.770
You hear me?

916
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:27.817
You're the only one who can save them.

917
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.698
I need the tail number.

918
00:50:33.781 --> 00:50:37.285
Get me next to the controller talking
to the guy flying the plane.

919
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:41.622
- Does he have flight experience?
- A couple hours in a Cessna.

920
00:50:41.706 --> 00:50:42.790
[keyboard clacking]

921
00:50:42.874 --> 00:50:44.584
[Ashley] Kari. what's going on?

922
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:45.752
[laptop beeps]

923
00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:49.839
It's November-Five-Five-
Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

924
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.773
- Are the girls okay?
- The girls are fine.

925
00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:08.858
I don't want them to see me panic.

926
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:11.152
You're not gonna panic.
The girls are fine.

927
00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:12.361
You can do this. Doug.

928
00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:15.782
you sorta have to if you ever wanna eat
my barbecue sauce again.

929
00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:20.369
Honey bear.

930
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:22.914
[laughs]

931
00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:24.207
That's almost funny.

932
00:51:27.627 --> 00:51:31.422
November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
we're ready to hand you off to Fort Myers.

933
00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:33.049
Do everything the way you are.

934
00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:36.302
You're keeping your heading.
You're doing a real nice descent.

935
00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:39.430
You've got me headed
almost due north here.

936
00:51:39.514 --> 00:51:41.849
Number Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
that's affirmative.

937
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.561
I just didn't wanna turn you
while you were descending.

938
00:51:45.645 --> 00:51:49.398
but if you feel ready to give it a try…
Okay. let's do it.

939
00:51:49.482 --> 00:51:51.275
I can try to make a turn.

940
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.611
I don't need any weather up here now.
ma'am.

941
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:55.029
[Terri] The weather's good here.

942
00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:57.448
but if we fly back to Naples.
it could get bad.

943
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.411
Need reports from the last hour.
Give me new ones as you get them.

944
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:03.496
All right. Got it.

945
00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:05.958
I wanna know what weather
pilots are running into

946
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.416
- where he's flying.
- Right.

947
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.252
- Get me someone from the NOAA.
- Copy.

948
00:52:11.212 --> 00:52:14.173
- Check weather systems in Fort Myers area.
- Already on it.

949
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:17.885
I've got a tropical depression in
the Gulf moving inland towards the coast.

950
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:21.973
- How long before it hits their heading?
- Not long enough.

951
00:52:22.807 --> 00:52:24.559
If he's not wheels down in 45 minutes.

952
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:28.521
this turns into an FAA emergency to
a Coast Guard recovery mission.

953
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.527
[Lisa] Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
just to confirm.

954
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.196
you sure you wanna turn left
while descending?

955
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.447
I could try.

956
00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.869
Bailey? Bailey. what's wrong?

957
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:44.871
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

958
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:55.840
"This product has been processed in
a facility that processes peanuts."

959
00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:58.134
[breathing heavily]

960
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.261
Mom!

961
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.847
Everything's gonna be okay. baby.

962
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.475
No. Mom. Bailey's sick! Bailey's sick!
She needs her shot!

963
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:08.477
Is she swelling up? Does she have a rash?

964
00:53:09.228 --> 00:53:11.397
Mom. she had candy that might've had nuts.

965
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.482
I need her EpiPen. Where is it?

966
00:53:13.566 --> 00:53:16.152
It's in the luggage compartment.
pink backpack. I'm coming.

967
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:19.155
No. you stay up there.
and you help Daddy. okay?

968
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:20.698
I can. uh…

969
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:22.116
I can do this.

970
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:23.993
You can do it. baby.

971
00:53:24.827 --> 00:53:27.038
I can do this. I can…

972
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.832
I can… I can do this.

973
00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:37.548
[grunting]

974
00:53:37.632 --> 00:53:40.843
Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
you're gonna turn to the left

975
00:53:40.927 --> 00:53:44.263
and fly a heading of about 2-7-0.

976
00:53:45.598 --> 00:53:49.185
Then continue that descent
down to 11.000 feet.

977
00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:51.395
All right. Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

978
00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:58.569
turn left to 2-7-0 down to 11.000 feet.

979
00:53:59.612 --> 00:54:02.406
I can't see the land. Just water.

980
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:04.450
You'll be on ground
before weather's a problem.

981
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.577
You said there's no weather.

982
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:09.246
How far away is the system?
A storm. or showers?

983
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.170
- Should we climb?
- [Doug] How far away is it?

984
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:12.959
[Terri] To get above the weather?

985
00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:15.127
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

986
00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:25.680
[keyboard clacking]

987
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:26.764
[laptop beeping]

988
00:54:26.847 --> 00:54:28.891
- They lied to him.
- What?

989
00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:34.397
If he's here. and this
weather system is here.

990
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.066
he's moving south
in a south-by-southeast heading.

991
00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:40.277
It's going right for him.

992
00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:44.115
You're like a baby Al Roker.

993
00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:45.992
How do you know all this?

994
00:54:46.075 --> 00:54:48.202
Planes have been my thing
since I could walk.

995
00:54:49.245 --> 00:54:51.789
I'm gonna finish
Amelia Earhart's flight one day.

996
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.124
You wanna come?

997
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:54.625
Are you crazy?

998
00:54:54.709 --> 00:54:57.712
I'm about to hear some random
dude die on a plane crash.

999
00:54:57.795 --> 00:54:59.422
Kari. what's going on?

1000
00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.506
[Kari] Pilot's dead.

1001
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:02.550
Passenger's flying the airplane.

1002
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:05.219
- What can I do to help?
- I don't know.

1003
00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:08.180
You can fly anything with wings.
We'll follow your lead.

1004
00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:14.228
November-Five-Five-
Niner-Delta-Whiskey. right?

1005
00:55:15.146 --> 00:55:16.439
Holy hell.

1006
00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:19.692
- Has he flown a King Air?
- Never.

1007
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.404
Dan. this guy's got no chance.

1008
00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:26.115
He'll be dead long before
he gets to Fort Myers.

1009
00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:28.993
Lucky if he can slow the
airplane enough to approach.

1010
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:32.830
Best case. he doesn't kill anyone within
a five-mile radius of the airport.

1011
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.373
Be his simulator.

1012
00:55:34.457 --> 00:55:36.751
Hang on. Dan. What?

1013
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.795
When you were teaching me how
to fly blind in the simulator.

1014
00:55:39.879 --> 00:55:43.591
you stood behind me and you talked me
through the instructions.

1015
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.802
This is real-world flying.

1016
00:55:46.886 --> 00:55:50.222
We can't hit reset if the plane skids off
the runway and into a building.

1017
00:55:50.306 --> 00:55:51.974
It's all the more reason.

1018
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:57.480
How far out is he.
and what's his altitude?

1019
00:55:57.563 --> 00:55:58.564
I don't know.

1020
00:55:59.732 --> 00:56:01.150
He's not on our radar yet.

1021
00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:04.487
- He can't configure the plane to land.
- What you wanna do?

1022
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:08.074
When he's in your airspace. tell me how
high he is and how fast he's going.

1023
00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:11.035
- Got it.
- How long's he been in the air?

1024
00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:13.162
Uh…

1025
00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:14.288
Less than an hour.

1026
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:15.372
Damn it.

1027
00:56:15.873 --> 00:56:17.166
It's full of fuel.

1028
00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:20.044
Probably.

1029
00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:24.381
Get the fire and rescue trucks ready.
get the first responders ready

1030
00:56:24.465 --> 00:56:26.675
near businesses and neighborhoods
around the airport.

1031
00:56:28.844 --> 00:56:31.597
[thunder rumbling]

1032
00:57:06.632 --> 00:57:07.842
King Air.

1033
00:57:15.141 --> 00:57:16.433
[Ashley] Uh…

1034
00:57:16.517 --> 00:57:19.186
- You find it?
- Kari. it's on the other shelf.

1035
00:57:23.274 --> 00:57:24.608
[Kari] Got it.

1036
00:57:29.155 --> 00:57:30.156
[grunts]

1037
00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:37.037
[grunts] Aw. dang it!

1038
00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:41.041
Number Five-Delta-Whiskey.
you're approaching a lower altitude.

1039
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:45.629
Start easing off of those controls
so the plane can fly level.

1040
00:57:45.713 --> 00:57:48.632
What happens if I turn
the autopilot back on?

1041
00:57:48.716 --> 00:57:49.925
I can do it. I'm ready.

1042
00:57:50.593 --> 00:57:54.138
November-Five-Delta-Whiskey.
if that makes you comfortable. you can.

1043
00:57:54.722 --> 00:57:55.723
[grunts]

1044
00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:57.933
Yeah. go ahead.

1045
00:57:58.517 --> 00:57:59.578
- Yes?
- [Doug] Yeah. do it.

1046
00:57:59.602 --> 00:58:01.020
[grunting]

1047
00:58:01.103 --> 00:58:02.354
All right.

1048
00:58:02.897 --> 00:58:05.566
Bad idea! Bad idea!

1049
00:58:07.193 --> 00:58:08.569
Five-Delta-Whiskey. roger.

1050
00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:12.072
There's a button to help with autopilot.
called slewing the heading bug.

1051
00:58:12.156 --> 00:58:13.324
I saw it in the manual.

1052
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:16.327
[man] Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
turn the knob to 270 degrees.

1053
00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:19.205
- 270 degrees.
- Okay. I could do that.

1054
00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:20.748
[grunts in frustration]

1055
00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:22.249
God. help!

1056
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:25.252
[Terri] I got it. It's the same.

1057
00:58:25.878 --> 00:58:28.130
- [Doug] Good. All right.
- [Terri] There! All right.

1058
00:58:28.214 --> 00:58:30.257
[Lisa] Roger that. Five-Delta-Whiskey.

1059
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:32.718
you'll be talking to Fort Myers Airport
in a minute.

1060
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:33.802
All right.

1061
00:58:33.886 --> 00:58:37.014
[Lisa] They'll take their time
and talk to you to get you down safe.

1062
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:40.392
Tune your radio
to the Fort Myers Airport frequency.

1063
00:58:40.476 --> 00:58:41.644
Can you do that?

1064
00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:47.650
Well. we got a real good copilot up here.
so I think we can do just about anything.

1065
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:50.194
I think she can. Yeah.

1066
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:55.324
[Lisa] Roger that.
The frequency is 132.07.

1067
00:58:56.659 --> 00:58:57.660
[Terri] Got it.

1068
00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:06.335
Fort Myers... Fort Myers Airport. Got it.

1069
00:59:06.418 --> 00:59:08.629
[static hissing]

1070
00:59:12.967 --> 00:59:16.011
[Brian] Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
Fort Myers Tower. How do you read?

1071
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.225
Holy crap. Holy crap.

1072
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:24.812
He's gone. Is he gone? Did that dude die?

1073
00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:27.147
[Brian] Fort Myers Tower. How do you read?

1074
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.566
I've never heard anybody die before…

1075
00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:33.988
Okay. This is freaking me out.
I'm going home.

1076
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:37.157
He's not talking.
That means they lost him.

1077
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:43.872
[Dan] All right. Here we go.

1078
00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:46.625
I got some help.

1079
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.860
- What are you doing?
- My friend...

1080
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.755
Don't do that. That's a federal violation.

1081
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.882
- He can help.
- He can't. Nor can you.

1082
00:59:53.966 --> 00:59:56.802
I'm still in charge
of this whole control center.

1083
00:59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.139
- Listen to what he says.
- Get the cell phone out of here.

1084
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.432
He can save his life!

1085
01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.195
- Get that phone...
- [Kari] Tell the pilot

1086
01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.561
he needs to slow down
before he gets close to the airport.

1087
01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:06.770
or he won't make it.

1088
01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.897
The plane will drop if he's too slow.

1089
01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:11.233
Has your friend ever flown a King Air?

1090
01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:12.651
[Kari] Upside down.

1091
01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.113
Take a seat.

1092
01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:22.494
Relax.
Brian. this goes bad. it's not on you.

1093
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.790
Relax? We need all the help we can get
if we want these people to survive.

1094
01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.667
Dan. take me off speaker.

1095
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.962
Everybody doesn't need
to hear what I tell you.

1096
01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:34.923
He's got to do about five things right
to land that plane.

1097
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.633
That's good to know.

1098
01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:40.679
But if he misses one of them.
he won't make it to see the other four.

1099
01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:43.474
[Brian] King Air Five-Five-
Niner-Delta-Whiskey. you on?

1100
01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:47.811
King Air Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
are you with us?

1101
01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:52.024
King Air Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
you on? Fort Myers Airport.

1102
01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.108
[Terri sighs]

1103
01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.401
I am.

1104
01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:56.195
What do you want me to do?

1105
01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.279
Lisa.

1106
01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.281
They've got him.

1107
01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.867
- They got him!
- What? He's alive?

1108
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.410
No way!

1109
01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.455
- [Doug] Turn it to 2-7-0? Niner-Delta…
- [grunting]

1110
01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:09.708
- Maggie. you all right? You find the pen?
- Working on it!

1111
01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.379
Where is it?

1112
01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:15.297
[grunts]

1113
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:21.845
There it is.

1114
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.229
Okay. I got it. Mom!

1115
01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.606
I got it! I got it. Mom!

1116
01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:34.942
Give your sister the shot. honey.

1117
01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:39.238
Bailey.

1118
01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.240
[grunts]

1119
01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:45.536
Bailey. look at me.

1120
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.121
Look at me. okay?

1121
01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.290
This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you. okay?

1122
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.167
You can do it. baby.

1123
01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.885
Bailey. Bailey. wake up!

1124
01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:03.095
Bailey.

1125
01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.141
Bailey. Bailey.
Bailey. we're almost on the ground.

1126
01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.811
- Look. we're almost on the ground.
- I feel weak. Where are we?

1127
01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:15.274
We got it.

1128
01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:19.361
- Look at the instruments there.
- Okay. I got it.

1129
01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:21.238
- See that turn?
- Yeah. Wow.

1130
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.614
- See that dial?
- Doing good.

1131
01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:24.032
- Keep an eye on it.
- Right.

1132
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.285
[Kari] Hang on. Dan.

1133
01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:39.006
[Brian] All right. King Air
Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

1134
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.591
Fort Myers Approach.

1135
01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:43.844
And are you descending
in the airplane right now. sir?

1136
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.181
I am. What do you want me to do?

1137
01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:51.852
Actually. if you can.
we can just keep descending.

1138
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.062
We're getting you some help
from another pilot

1139
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.898
who's familiar with the airplane.

1140
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.025
Is he in the control tower with you?

1141
01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.735
He is in…

1142
01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.445
- Connecticut.
- In Connecticut.

1143
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.490
but I understand he's a very
skilled and experienced airman.

1144
01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.118
I can use all the help I can get.

1145
01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:11.205
It's just me. and my wife.
and my girls up here.

1146
01:03:12.498 --> 01:03:13.624
He's coming in fast.

1147
01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:16.126
Help me with this.

1148
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.590
Here. Help me with this.

1149
01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:26.470
[Doug] Thank you. sir.

1150
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:29.181
You're gonna stay
on the horn with me. right?

1151
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.600
That's correct. I'm here for the duration.

1152
01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:36.730
I've got nothing else to do but make sure
you get all the help you need.

1153
01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.858
[Dan] Yeah. It's a King Air 200.

1154
01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.695
Cockpit looks like nothing
he's ever seen before.

1155
01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:44.821
Probably.

1156
01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:47.533
What are you doing?

1157
01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.243
Building you a cockpit.

1158
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.079
[dramatic music playing]

1159
01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:03.340
[no audio]

1160
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:23.068
[no audio]

1161
01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:51.096
- Did I get it right?
- Not quite.

1162
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.098
Well. what's missing?

1163
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.683
I could use a copilot.

1164
01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:03.775
Listen. Dan. we've got a very tight window
for how fast he needs to fly.

1165
01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.485
Got it.

1166
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.737
[Kari] Is he on autopilot?

1167
01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:10.574
- Ask if he's using autopilot.
- November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

1168
01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.660
are you using autopilot
or are you flying the airplane?

1169
01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.787
[Doug] The autopilot is off.

1170
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:17.873
Slow him down. He's all over the place.

1171
01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.916
- We gotta slow him down.
- [phone beeps]

1172
01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.338
[John]
The plane's over the Gulf of Mexico.

1173
01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:27.758
He's supposed to turn inland
to set up his approach to Fort Myers.

1174
01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:31.178
If he doesn't make it to land.
we got backup.

1175
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.521
Fort Myers. can you see how fast
we're going on the radar?

1176
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:43.982
Faster. He's gotta go faster.

1177
01:05:44.066 --> 01:05:47.027
- They slowed him too much. It'll stall.
- Like a car?

1178
01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:03.210
If he goes too slow.
wind will stop flowing over the wing

1179
01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.712
and the plane can drop out of the sky.

1180
01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.714
It's probably what happened to Amelia.

1181
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.678
Faster. Go faster!

1182
01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.351
He's gotta speed up. The plane will drop.

1183
01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:22.521
[Brian] Okay.
Looks like you're coming up on 5.000 feet

1184
01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:26.316
just a little slower than we'd like. Um…

1185
01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:30.487
So. when you're able.
make a. make a left turn.

1186
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.073
We're turning him.

1187
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:37.661
Get his speed up.
He can't turn going that slow.

1188
01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.788
Make sure he speeds up before he turns.

1189
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.126
Yeah. how many first responders
do you have? Get more.

1190
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.921
Are you sure I'm in a turn?
I can't see very well up here.

1191
01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.090
That compass ain't moving.

1192
01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.843
I don't see land. only water.
We over the ocean?

1193
01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:54.720
- Do you see the horizon?
- [Terri] No.

1194
01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:56.596
[Doug] I cannot see the horizon.

1195
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.766
All I see is baby blue sky
and baby blue water.

1196
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.644
I don't see land. just ocean.
We going the right way?

1197
01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:06.523
- Look out the window. See anything?
- It's all blue. Everything is blue.

1198
01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.483
He's having trouble making the turn.

1199
01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:14.906
[Lisa] He's flying right toward the storm.

1200
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:16.908
It picked up too fast.

1201
01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.326
I thought he had time.

1202
01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.581
If he's over the Gulf.
he's looking at blue sky and water.

1203
01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.916
He's disoriented.
can't tell where he's turning.

1204
01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:28.253
Kari. his heading has him flying
into a weather system.

1205
01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:31.173
Damn it! We should've turned him sooner.

1206
01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:40.348
[dramatic music playing]

1207
01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.482
What is it? What do you see?

1208
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.317
[Kari] The flight control systems.

1209
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.652
King Air is built on a Cessna.

1210
01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.614
It may be bigger and fancier.
but it still flies the same.

1211
01:07:57.324 --> 01:08:00.452
Single engine. Tell him to fly it
like a single-engine plane.

1212
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.079
Just like a Cessna.
Don't worry about anything else.

1213
01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.791
Just tell him to remember
when he was in a Cessna.

1214
01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.836
Tell him to fly it
like a single-engine plane.

1215
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.840
Just like a Cessna. Tell him to remember
the last time he was in a Cessna.

1216
01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.759
Okay. Niner-Delta-Whiskey.

1217
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.721
the information I have is. to fly the
aircraft like you would a single-engine.

1218
01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:21.765
Well. I can do that.

1219
01:08:22.891 --> 01:08:26.895
The only thing is. the only time
I was in one of those was with my brother.

1220
01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:29.272
and there weren't dark clouds
in front of me.

1221
01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.278
Well. your turn looks good.

1222
01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:36.863
We ain't going down that easy.

1223
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.740
Very good. sir.

1224
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:43.745
[Doug] Okay. I'm at zero-niner-zero.
Starting to get the hang of this thing.

1225
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:46.623
I don't know if I can outrun these clouds.

1226
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.000
They're starting to surround us.

1227
01:08:49.668 --> 01:08:54.673
Niner-Delta-Whiskey.
is there a landing checklist?

1228
01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:56.633
Oh. um…

1229
01:08:57.342 --> 01:08:58.760
Did you find it. honey?

1230
01:08:58.844 --> 01:09:00.887
- Did you find a checklist?
- [Terri] Yeah.

1231
01:09:00.971 --> 01:09:04.599
The landing gear levers
should be below the main panel.

1232
01:09:04.683 --> 01:09:06.059
should say "landing gear."

1233
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.812
I think I know how to put
the landing gear down.

1234
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.148
But this...
We're getting bounced around up here.

1235
01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:14.109
He's about to put landing gear down.

1236
01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.278
No. It's too fast. Don't touch the gear.

1237
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.822
Not yet. He's too fast. Too hot. Too hot.

1238
01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:22.200
They're telling me you're too
fast for your landing gear.

1239
01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:26.329
You just tell me when.
Help me get slowed down here.

1240
01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:30.542
Okay. sir.
I'll have that for you in a moment.

1241
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.335
How much fuel do you have. sir?

1242
01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.296
Uh. here's the fuel. Right here.

1243
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.798
[Doug]
Just so you know. we got plenty of fuel.

1244
01:09:36.882 --> 01:09:39.217
- That's not an issue.
- It's an issue for us.

1245
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.345
Yeah. Get another fire truck.

1246
01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.765
Call around. We need as much water
and foam as we can get.

1247
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.976
This is a twin-engine coming in full tank.

1248
01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.520
If he's not down soon.
storm could take him out.

1249
01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:52.772
and that plane could drop out of the sky.

1250
01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.441
Okay. but where is he now?

1251
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:55.525
He's about…

1252
01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.277
[keyboard clacking]

1253
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.279
…15 miles from the airport. Look at this.

1254
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.574
Houses and buildings all over.
We're right here.

1255
01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:05.201
Shouldn't we. like. not be here?

1256
01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.663
- That's a really good idea.
- [Buggy chuckles]

1257
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.136
- How far out is he?
- About 15 miles.

1258
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.222
Damn it!

1259
01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.897
- Okay. where is he?
- [Dan] 5.300 feet.

1260
01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.567
- He's got alarms going off.
- Ignore them. Fly the plane.

1261
01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:40.403
Brian. Kari said ignore the alarms.
just fly the plane.

1262
01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:41.821
4.700.

1263
01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:44.616
- 240 knots.
- [Kari] Okay.

1264
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:49.204
When we get you a little bit slower.
um. I will give you the signal.

1265
01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:52.999
- [alarm beeping]
- Well. tell me how to get slower first.

1266
01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:57.295
Slow to turn. now I'm too fast to land.
What do I do here?

1267
01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.966
Let's go. You don't wanna
be near that runway when he comes in.

1268
01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:03.551
[engines roaring]

1269
01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.555
- I got it.
- You watch my altitude and speed.

1270
01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:09.808
6.000 feet. 210 knots.

1271
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:14.646
Niner-Delta-Whiskey. make a left
turn to zero-six-zero.

1272
01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:18.858
That should line you up with the airport.
and then I'll slow you down.

1273
01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:20.527
Heading bug. Zero-six-zero.

1274
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.070
- I'll do that.
- Put that on.

1275
01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:23.780
[Doug] Zero-six-zero.

1276
01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.618
Clouds are getting awful close.

1277
01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.705
[Brian] Yes. A few gusts.
but you should be fine.

1278
01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.623
Trying to get you to a lower airspeed

1279
01:11:33.707 --> 01:11:35.917
where you can drop
your landing gear and flaps.

1280
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.293
[Doug] I'm ready and waiting.

1281
01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:39.212
Can you find the landing checklist?

1282
01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.547
Okay. Flaps.

1283
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.590
- All right. What do I do?
- Right.

1284
01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:44.217
First thing is approach speed.

1285
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.721
Okay. pull back on your power
a little bit at a time.

1286
01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.848
Okay? Until you reach 160 knots.

1287
01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:52.559
- So. where are we headed?
- The airport.

1288
01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:57.355
That seems like the unsafest place to be
during a plane crash!

1289
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.941
Five miles out. 3.100 feet. 180 knots.

1290
01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:03.236
At 160 knots. let the landing gear down.

1291
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.614
All right. I'm lined up for the runway.
Looks like a little...

1292
01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.534
- It's like a little brown slip.
- [Terri] Yeah.

1293
01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:11.745
Do you show me lined up with the runway?

1294
01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:15.123
Yes. sir. That is correct.
You have the field in sight.

1295
01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.002
Bailey.

1296
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.087
I feel weak. Where are we?

1297
01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.757
You know what?

1298
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.592
We're in a cumulus cloud. Look.

1299
01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.303
Remember that?
You always wanted to see one up close.

1300
01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.639
Pretty sure it's a cirrus.

1301
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.641
[laughs]

1302
01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.436
How are the girls?

1303
01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:40.273
They're doing good. They'll be better
when we get on the ground.

1304
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.609
Make sure you're buckled up back there!

1305
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:46.863
He's got the field in sight.

1306
01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.491
Control his speed.
Landing gear's going down soon.

1307
01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:53.244
He's gotta control speed.

1308
01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:55.997
[Brian] Okay. When you get
your speed under control.

1309
01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:57.832
descend down to 2.000 feet.

1310
01:12:57.916 --> 01:13:00.877
I am showing your speed at 160 knots.

1311
01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:03.546
2.200 feet. 160 knots.

1312
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.131
Landing gear down. Now!

1313
01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:07.842
I need you to lower your landing gear
down now. sir.

1314
01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:10.595
[Terri] Okay. I got it.
I'm ready when you tell me.

1315
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.222
- [Doug] Just pull it down.
- Now?

1316
01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:14.307
- Yes. pull it down.
- I got it!

1317
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.475
[Doug] All right.

1318
01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.018
Landing gear's going down.

1319
01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:19.062
[whirring]

1320
01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:21.940
[beeps]

1321
01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.408
[whirring]

1322
01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.248
[Brian] All right.
make sure you stay on throttle.

1323
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:41.000
I need you to maintain 140 knots.

1324
01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:48.049
400 feet. 120.

1325
01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:54.305
I can't hold this thing on the runway.
It's drifting off.

1326
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.227
I'm floating left.
I can't hold it on the runway.

1327
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.395
I'm floating left.

1328
01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:03.648
This is getting real bad.
I can't hold this thing. I need help.

1329
01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:11.447
It's a wind shear! Wind'll blow the plane
off the runway before they land!

1330
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.910
[automated voice]
Caution! Caution! Manual. Stall.

1331
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.581
- I got alarms going off!
- [automated voice] Pull up. Pull up.

1332
01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:21.332
Pull up.

1333
01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.464
Brian. he's not lined up!

1334
01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.175
[Doug] Help me! Help me!

1335
01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:32.218
Pull up! Pull up! Add full power.

1336
01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.678
[automated voice] Pull up.

1337
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:45.231
He's going around.

1338
01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:46.858
Crosswind.

1339
01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:49.027
Crosswinds.

1340
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.030
[electrical buzzing]

1341
01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.156
Hello?

1342
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.366
- Hello?
- [phone clicks]

1343
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.493
Hello?

1344
01:14:58.161 --> 01:14:59.162
Dan. you still there?

1345
01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:00.371
Dan!

1346
01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.166
- [phone beeping]
- Damn it.

1347
01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:06.127
[line ringing]

1348
01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:09.547
This is Dan Favio.
Please leave a message. [beeps]

1349
01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:13.009
Kari?

1350
01:15:13.635 --> 01:15:14.677
Kari?

1351
01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:18.890
- I've lost him.
- What?

1352
01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.183
You've gotta be kidding me.

1353
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.945
This is getting real bad.
I can't hold this thing! I need help!

1354
01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:34.822
