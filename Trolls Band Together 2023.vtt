Oh. come on.

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:49.564
God. I want to boil an egg
on those abs.

19
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.332
John Dory. do I really have to
keep wearing these things?

20
00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:55.036
Yes. you do. Clay.

21
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.269
They're funderdrawers.

22
00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:58.341
It's underwear but 76% more fun.

23
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:00.303

Bro. you look stressed. Breathe.

28
00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.052
Well. of course I'm stressed. Floyd.

29
00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:11.485
It's the first show of the tour.

30
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.021
We have to hit
the perfect family harmony.

31
00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:15.625
We promised the fans.

32
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.653
Okay. calm down.

33
00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:18.027
You're making Baby Branch nervous.

35
00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.856

What? Nervous?

36
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.863
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no.

37
00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:24.764
He's not allowed to be nervous.
He's got to be perfect.

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.802
Cut him some slack. John Dory.
It's his first show.

39
00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:29.634
Oh. come on. abs!

40
00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.473
Hey. Branch. How you feeling?

41
00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.978
I feel like I'm gonna barf
and pass out and...

42
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.108
And pee your pants all at once?

43
00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:37.639
How'd you know?

44
00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.282
Ah. you got the preshow jitters.

45
00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:41.351
Completely normal.
Everyone gets 'em.

46
00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:43.713
You want to know what I do
when I get 'em?

47
00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.651
Barf. pass out
and pee your pants?

48
00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:47.551
I remember that
I'm with my brothers

49
00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.191
and that when we come together.

50
00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:51.153
there is nothing
that we can't do.

51
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.493
But no one's ever hit the
perfect family harmony before.

52
00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:57.262
Is it true
it can shatter diamonds?

53
00:02:57.398 --> 00:02:58.694
Yeah. It's that powerful.

54
00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.269
All right. boys. just remember.

55
00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.330
no matter what you do.
follow my lead.

56
00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.472
Or maybe let's just go out
there and have fun together.

57
00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:08.205
It's just so much pressure.

58
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.642
Ten seconds!

59
00:03:09.777 --> 00:03:11.881
A-And what happens
if we can't hit it?

60
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.416
Oh. that's not an option.

61
00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:14.576
If we can't hit
the perfect family harmony.

62
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.078
we aren't perfect.

63
00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:18.047
And if we aren't perfect.
we're nothing.

64
00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:20.686
Just follow my lead.
and the harmony will happen.

65
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.919
- Let's bro!

66
00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:25.894

The heartthrob.

68
00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:31.895
The fun boy.

69
00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:34.535
The sensitive one.

70
00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.768
The leader.

71
00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:38.836

Ow.

103
00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:07.188
Ladies and gentlemen.
please stand by.

104
00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:11.200
Uh. we're experiencing.
uh. some stuff.

105
00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:13.565
Hey. At least we didn't fall.

106
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.231
- Whoa!

107
00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:16.770
We fell.

108
00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:18.835
See what happens
when you don't follow my lead?

109
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.702
Dude. that is
exactly what happens

110
00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:22.404
when we follow your lead.

111
00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.646
Oh. so it's my fault?
Is that what you're saying?

112
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.676
I know we can reach
the perfect family harmony.

113
00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:29.481
What if we don't want to?

114
00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:31.486
Yeah. dude. This used to be fun.

115
00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:33.622
Now it's all about
being perfect.

116
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:35.558
You know what?
I'm done playing the heartthrob.

117
00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:38.823
My exquisitely chiseled
rock-hard abs and I quit.

118
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.955
I quit. too.
and you can keep these.

119
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.659
I'm more than just the fun one.

120
00:05:42.794 --> 00:05:44.597
I'm in a sad book club.

121
00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:46.767
Did you know that?
A sad book club.

122
00:05:46.902 --> 00:05:49.104
I'm gonna find trolls
who take me seriously.

123
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.504
Fine. I don't need this.

124
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.408
I'm out. I'm done. I'm sorry.

125
00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:55.142
I'm gonna go hike
the Neverglade Trail

126
00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:56.707
by myself. bro-lone.

127
00:05:56.842 --> 00:05:58.277
Yeah. that's right.

128
00:05:58.413 --> 00:06:00.079
Bro-bro going solo.

129
00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:01.279
YOLO.

130
00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:02.578
Goodbye forever.

131
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.584
- Fine. I'm out of here.
Later. losers.

132
00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.283
- Same here.
- Guys. please.

133
00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.417
Come on.

134
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.158
It's my fault.

135
00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:12.693
I ruined everything.

136
00:06:12.828 --> 00:06:15.396
No. no. Branch.
this is not your fault.

137
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.760
We're not in sync.

138
00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:18.360
We've gone from boys to men.

139
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:20.463
and now there's only
one direction for us to go:

140
00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:21.696
the backstreets.

141
00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:23.237
But not you. Floyd.

142
00:06:23.373 --> 00:06:25.472
You're not leaving. too.

143
00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:27.239
Not forever. I'll be back.

144
00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:28.709
I promise.

145
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:31.342
But right now I...
I have to follow my heart.

146
00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:34.347
It's telling me that it's time
to start a solo career.

147
00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:36.784
But what am I gonna do?

148
00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.056
Branch. you are gonna do
the most important thing of all.

149
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.751
You're gonna...

150
00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:44.653
take care of Grandma.

151
00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.689
Oh. come on. Branch.

152
00:06:46.825 --> 00:06:48.328
Let's play some rummy.

153
00:06:48.464 --> 00:06:49.996
But I won't let you win.

154
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:52.564
- because I play for the money.

155
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.168
You might have to let her win.

156
00:06:55.304 --> 00:06:56.605
Occasionally.

157
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:01.577
When you miss me.
you can wear this.

158
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:03.405
It'll be like
I'm right here with you.

159
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.081
And when you come back.
we'll make our hideout.

160
00:07:07.216 --> 00:07:09.180
Definitely.

161
00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:12.148
Wow.
Is that a ten-story waterslide?

162
00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:13.983
Yeah. That's how we shower.

163
00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:17.626
Well. we better keep this
in a safe place.

164
00:07:25.503 --> 00:07:27.464
I'll see you soon. Baby Branch.

165
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.147
Bye.

166

00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:08.611
Are you all right?

179
00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:10.174
You're smiling and crying
at the same time.

180
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.609
It kind of looks like
it's hurting your face.

181
00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:12.976
It does hurt my face.

182
00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:15.084
I guess I'm just
missing my. um...

183
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.411
grandma.

184
00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.285
I was just listening
to some of her old records.

185
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.782
BroZone? No way.

186
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.122
I love BroZone.

187
00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:23.318
Really?

188
00:08:23.453 --> 00:08:24.890
I mean...
Really?

189
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:25.653
I didn't know
you liked them. too.

190
00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:26.791
I don't.

191
00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:27.789
I'm actually hate-listening.

192
00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.091
It's a new thing.

193
00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:31.195
My grandma had
very questionable taste.

194
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.063
I mean. just look at
how she decorated this place.

195
00:08:33.198 --> 00:08:34.736
I'm sorry.
but there are some things

196
00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:36.705
that just shouldn't be macraméd.
Am I right?

197
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.203
Uh. kind of seems like

198
00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:41.944
there's something
you're not telling me.

199
00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:42.739
What?

200
00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:44.074
Be silly. No.

201
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:46.915
Hey. I need you
to be real with me.

202
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.084
It seems like more than
a macramé issue.

203
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.519
If you're having feelings.
you can talk about them with me.

204
00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:56.257
Okay.

205
00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:58.221

Yeah. Oh. 'cause it would
be weird if we got married.

- Wow.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.465
Sorry. Is this bad timing?

317
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.801
-I'm just trying
to find a troll named...

318
00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:12.268
Whoo! Baby Branch!

319
00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:13.809
Uh. you're making a mistake.

00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:15.908
stranger that looks
similar to me.

00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:17.074
There's no Branch here.

322
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.978
Look at you. You got so big.

323
00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:20.648
You're not a branch anymore.

324
00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:22.113
You're more like a trunk.

325
00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:23.512
- Junk in the trunk.
- Ow.

326
00:14:23.648 --> 00:14:25.614
I bet you
I can still pick you up.

327
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.918
- Come on. Ooh. you got heavy.

328
00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:29.183
Aah! There goes my back.

329
00:14:29.318 --> 00:14:30.722
Oh. charley horse.

330
00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:32.024
Oh. God. Aah!

331
00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.424
- Two charley horses.
- Hey!

332
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.996
Stop right there.
You put my boyfriend down.

333
00:14:35.132 --> 00:14:36.457
Tell us who you are
and what you want.

334
00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:38.094
-  Ow.
- Hey.

335
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.462
What up?

336
00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:41.034
You're right.
Totally rude of me.

337
00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:42.699
Didn't introduce myself.

338
00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:44.768
- I'm Branch's brother.

339
00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:45.869
What?

340
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.104

341
00:14:52.544 --> 00:14:54.548
used to be my brother.

342
00:14:54.683 --> 00:14:55.849
Not anymore.

343
00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:57.482
Hey. um. r-remember earlier

344
00:14:57.617 --> 00:15:00.053
when I said you should
open up to me and be real?

345
00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:01.385
- Well...
- You could've started

346
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.091
by telling me
you had a secret brother!

347
00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:05.661
- Former brother.
- That's not how DNA works!

348
00:15:05.797 --> 00:15:07.295
Dad. did you know about this?

349
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:10.699
What would I know
about secret family members?

350
00:15:13.103 --> 00:15:14.666
Oh. my gosh.
I was being so rude.

351
00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.234
I've never met anyone
from Branch's family before.

352
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.699
I'm Poppy. Branch's girlfriend.

353
00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:19.501
Should we hug. fist-bump.
smile and wave for now

354
00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:21.242
and see where
the night takes us?

355
00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:23.009
- All of the above.
- Wait. I know you.

356
00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:25.044
You're the guy from BroZone!

357
00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:27.047
We were just listening to them.

358
00:15:27.182 --> 00:15:28.644
- Yeah. BroZone!
Oh. wait.

359
00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:30.350
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
Don't tell me.

360
00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:31.545
Um. okay. well.
you're not the heartthrob.

361
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.220
Well. that's your opinion. I...

362
00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:34.289
The fun one?
No. you're kind of uptight.

363
00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:35.385
Uptight?

364
00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:37.091
Mm. not the sensitive one. either.

365
00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:38.287
Okay. a lot of assumptions
for someone

366
00:15:38.422 --> 00:15:39.721
you just met 30 seconds ago.

367
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.456
Oh. oh! I've got it.
You're John Dory.

368
00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:43.530
- The leader.
- The old one.

369
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:46.497
Uh. sorry to interrupt.
but we lose the venue

370
00:15:46.633 --> 00:15:48.470
- at 11:00. so...
- Shh. I'm trying to listen.

371
00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:49.597
Very hot gossip.

372
00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:52.273
So. if-if you're Branch's bro.

373
00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:55.106
then that means that
all the other BroZone bros

374
00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:57.478
are Branch's bros. too.

375
00:15:58.642 --> 00:16:00.308
Branch. how come
you never told me?

376
00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:01.910
Because it's complicated.

377
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.614
Oh. sweetie.
'Cause you weren't in the band.

378
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.916
Branch was
in the band all right.

379
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:08.019
What?

380
00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:09.217
No way. Which one was he?

381
00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:10.885
- Bitty B.
- Bitty B?

382
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.561
No. that's impossible.
Bitty B had glasses.

383
00:16:13.697 --> 00:16:14.695
Oh. and a diaper.

384
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.730
♪ And... ♪

385
00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:18.601
A falsetto made of gold.

386
00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:19.934
Not that anyone cared.

387
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:21.299
But that's all in the past.

388
00:16:21.435 --> 00:16:22.864
Because they stopped
being my brothers

389
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.140
the day they walked out on me
and never came back.

390
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:27.140
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
That's not fair. Branch.

391
00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:29.044
I did come back.
but no one was there.

392
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.045
It-it wasn't until
I heard about you

393
00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:32.543
saving the world
from the rock apocalypse

394
00:16:32.678 --> 00:16:34.576
that I realized
you were even still alive.

395
00:16:34.711 --> 00:16:36.312
Oh. that's-that's so sweet.

396
00:16:36.448 --> 00:16:37.678
He realized I was still alive.

397
00:16:37.814 --> 00:16:39.615
- 20 years too late!
- Hi. Sorry.

398
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.622
He gets hangry
if he skips breakfast.

399
00:16:41.757 --> 00:16:42.850
I had breakfast.

400
00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:45.058
It was avocado toast
with two poached eggs.

401
00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:46.523
some cayenne for a little kick.

402
00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:48.592
and you know what.
it was delightful.

403
00:16:48.727 --> 00:16:50.131
Branch.
what's going on with you?

404
00:16:50.266 --> 00:16:51.766
The question
we should be asking is:

405
00:16:51.902 --> 00:16:53.401
What's going on with him?

406
00:16:53.537 --> 00:16:54.829
I bet you he's only here
because he needs something.

407
00:16:54.964 --> 00:16:56.802
That's not true.
He's your brother.

408
00:16:56.937 --> 00:16:58.966
Branch. I'm gonna be straight
with you. I need something.

409
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.910
- And there it is.
- Come on. man. I'm trying here.

410
00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:03.579
Wait. wait. wait.
Hold up. Branch.

411
00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:04.909
It's about Floyd.

412
00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:06.715
What do you mean?

413
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:08.348
He's in danger. man.

John Dory?

00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:58.426
I can't believe it.

440
00:18:58.562 --> 00:19:00.491
I never thought I'd see
any of my brothers again.

441
00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:01.856
I'm gonna get you
out of here. bro.

442
00:19:01.992 --> 00:19:03.491
No. you've got to get
out of here.

443
00:19:03.627 --> 00:19:05.026
You don't understand.

444
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:07.161
Velvet and Veneer are giant.
pop-obsessed succubi

445
00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:08.864
with no talent.
and they've been stealing mine.

446
00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:10.603
And they'll be back any minute
for more.

447
00:19:10.738 --> 00:19:13.006
What? That's even worse
than lip-synching.

448
00:19:13.142 --> 00:19:15.004
Not my brother. Not today.

449
00:19:22.218 --> 00:19:23.882
- John. John. stop.

450
00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:27.422
The bottle is made of diamond.
and there's only one thing

451
00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:29.690
that's powerful enough
to shatter diamond.

452
00:19:29.825 --> 00:19:30.819
Right.

453
00:19:30.954 --> 00:19:33.295
A diamond-shattering
diamond hammer.

454
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.657
- Where can we get one of those?
- No. John.

455
00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:39.031
It's the perfect family harmony.

456
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.035
Of course.

457
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.572
The perfect family harmony.

458
00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:46.436
VELVET
Our voices sound like garbage.

459
00:19:46.571 --> 00:19:48.273
We are dying out there.

460
00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:50.341
What we need is more troll.

461
00:19:50.477 --> 00:19:52.377
Run. John Dory. Save yourself.

462
00:19:52.512 --> 00:19:54.313
Don't worry. Floyd.

463
00:19:54.448 --> 00:19:55.948
I'll be back with the bros.

464
00:19:56.084 --> 00:19:57.550
You have my word!

465
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:01.554
Floyd.

466
00:20:01.689 --> 00:20:03.356
So you came here
to get the band back together

467
00:20:03.492 --> 00:20:04.885
and sing
the perfect family harmony.

468
00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:06.625
- Yeah.
- Oh. yeah. so we can attempt

469
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.362
to sing something
we've only tried once

470
00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:10.363
and failed so miserably at
that we broke up

471
00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:12.297
and never talked
to each other again.

472
00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:14.201
- We are so in!
- What?

473
00:20:14.336 --> 00:20:17.704
Uh. could you give us a second?

474
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.533
Huh?

475
00:20:18.668 --> 00:20:20.839
Okay. what are you doing?

476
00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:23.277
This is your second chance
with your brothers. Branch.

477
00:20:23.413 --> 00:20:25.205
It's not that easy. okay?

478
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:27.849
You don't get it.
You don't have any siblings.

479
00:20:27.984 --> 00:20:29.243
That's my point.

480
00:20:29.378 --> 00:20:31.682
Branch. you are so lucky
to have a brother to fight for.

481
00:20:31.817 --> 00:20:33.752
I mean. if I had a sister...

482
00:20:33.888 --> 00:20:35.690
it would be so perfect.
We'd be best friends.

483
00:20:35.826 --> 00:20:37.493
and we'd teach each other
things. and we'd never fight.

484
00:20:37.628 --> 00:20:38.821
Poppy. -And we'd always
have each other's back.

485
00:20:38.956 --> 00:20:40.728
and we wouldn't even
have to talk

486
00:20:40.863 --> 00:20:42.698
'cause we'd think
all the same thoughts. -Poppy.

487
00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:44.466
And everyone would ask us if
we were twins. and we'd laugh.

488
00:20:44.602 --> 00:20:45.161
and we'd be like.
"Well. not technically." -Poppy!

489
00:20:45.296 --> 00:20:46.232
But...

490
00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:47.699
if she were ever in trouble.

491
00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:50.332
I would do everything I could
to help her.

492
00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:51.632
I would show up.

493
00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:53.838
Okay. listen.

494
00:20:53.973 --> 00:20:56.738
If there was a brother
that I might do this for--

495
00:20:56.873 --> 00:20:59.144
and I'm not saying there is--

496
00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:00.707
it would be Floyd.

497
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:02.084
I'm not hearing "no."

498
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.911
- Yes! Works for me.
- Yeah!

499
00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:05.680
- BroZone 2.0. BroZone reunion.

500
00:21:05.815 --> 00:21:07.147
BroZone. here we bro again.

501
00:21:07.283 --> 00:21:08.853
- BroZone. where'd they bro?

502
00:21:08.988 --> 00:21:10.191
I don't know.
We're gonna find them!

503
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.391
- Whoa!

504
00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:15.092
Hey. looks like our ride's here.

505
00:21:15.227 --> 00:21:16.462
Whoo!

506
00:21:16.598 --> 00:21:17.832
- Here she is.

507
00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:23.868
Oh. that's coming out
of the deposit.

508
00:21:24.003 --> 00:21:26.268
Meet Rhonda. y'all.
Ain't she a beaut?

509
00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:31.980
- She's. uh. really something.
- Oh.

510
00:21:32.115 --> 00:21:33.541
Um. I guess she likes me?

511
00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:35.183
Yeah. she does.

512
00:21:35.318 --> 00:21:37.219
Or she's marking you as prey.

513
00:21:37.355 --> 00:21:38.883
Can never quite tell
with Rhonda.

514
00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:42.719
Uh. guys. if you don't mind.

515
00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:45.258
I really cannot wait
another minute

516
00:21:45.393 --> 00:21:47.626
to marry this gorgeous specimen.

517
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:50.931
I now pronounce you

518
00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.429
husband and wife.

519
00:21:56.235 --> 00:21:57.769
Oh!

520
00:21:59.168 --> 00:22:01.470
Okay. all aboard
who's going aboard.

521
00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:02.906
Bye. everybody!

522
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.443
We're getting the band
back together.

523
00:22:04.578 --> 00:22:05.847
- Bye. Poppy.

I'm an open book.

00:22:51.593 --> 00:22:53.892
Wide open. We're gaping novels.

545
00:22:54.027 --> 00:22:56.697
Okay. well. who are
some of your biggest influences?

546
00:22:56.832 --> 00:23:00.465
Honestly. Vel's always been
my inspiration.

547
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.336
My biggest inspiration? Hmm.

548
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:04.571
I'd have to go with also me.

549
00:23:04.707 --> 00:23:06.134
Well. one thing's for sure.

550
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.444
after two months on the scene.
the superstar duo

551
00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:10.646
will receive the prestigious
Lifer Award.

552
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:13.009
That's celebrating
a lifetime of achievements.

553
00:23:13.144 --> 00:23:15.180
Be sure to catch
their performance this weekend

554
00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:17.077
at the Rage Dome.

555
00:23:17.213 --> 00:23:19.083
Last question:
How do you guys stay

556
00:23:19.218 --> 00:23:22.389
the biggest superstars
Mount Rageous has ever known?

557
00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:24.120
- What's your secret?
- Secret?

558
00:23:24.255 --> 00:23:25.825
We don't have a secret.

559
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.287
Who said we have a secret?

560
00:23:27.423 --> 00:23:29.626
What my calm.
casual-sounding brother means

561
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:31.360
is it's simple. really.

562
00:23:31.496 --> 00:23:36.070
It just takes lots of hard work
and loads of natural talent.

563
00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:43.245
If we're gonna make it
through the Rage Dome show.

564
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.871
we're gonna need more troll.

565
00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:46.775
Crimp. what are you doing?

566
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.709
Why are you always hovering?

567
00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:50.884
Uh. I'm standing.

568
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.887
Well. be a good little assistant
and go stand in the corner.

569
00:23:54.023 --> 00:23:55.055
Oh. yes.

570
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.491
Um. oh. dear.

571
00:23:56.626 --> 00:23:59.489
I think this is
kind of a c-corner.

572
00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:01.495
Okay. I cannot with her.

573
00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:03.064
- It's really too much.
- Whew.

574
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.764
Well. time for a spritz.

575
00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:07.702
No. please. I barely have
any talent left to give.

576
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:09.936
I mean. maybe. like.
a desperate Christmas album

577
00:24:10.072 --> 00:24:13.836
or a one-off national anthem
performance. but that is it.

578
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:15.242
Oh. really? You don't wanna?

579
00:24:15.378 --> 00:24:16.644
Okay. that's fine.

580
00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.141
We'll just kiss
our careers goodbye

581
00:24:18.276 --> 00:24:20.277
and focus our efforts
on charity. -

582
00:24:20.412 --> 00:24:22.210
Good one.

583
00:24:33.188 --> 00:24:35.256
That's more like it.

584
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:36.995
We're so close
to having everything

585
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.262
we always knew we believed
we deserved to have.

586
00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:43.164
Veneer. what's with your vibe
and your face?

587
00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:44.903
Why do you have
resting-moody-vibe face?

588
00:24:45.038 --> 00:24:46.740
No. I know
we've deserved to be famous

589
00:24:46.875 --> 00:24:49.276
just 'cause we want to.
but honestly.

590
00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:50.977
that dude looks rough.

591
00:24:51.112 --> 00:24:53.108
He's fine.
- And he's getting pale.

592
00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:56.247
And not in. like.
a stunning Victorian way.

593
00:24:57.752 --> 00:24:59.082
Don't you see what you're doing?

594
00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:01.755
You're literally sucking
the life out of me.

595
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:03.185
Ugh. That's what I tell Crimp
every day.

596
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.890
What are we gonna do?

597
00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:06.825
We obviously can't rely
on this troll

598
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.461
to get us through
this dress rehearsal.

599
00:25:08.597 --> 00:25:10.095
let alone the Rage Dome show.

600
00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:13.697
It's all going to change
as soon as we have BroZone.

601
00:25:13.832 --> 00:25:14.728
- BroZone?
Yep.

602
00:25:14.864 --> 00:25:16.537
I forged a letter

603
00:25:16.673 --> 00:25:18.833
begging for them
to come and save you.

604
00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:20.572
I love me.

605
00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:22.643
No! You leave my brothers alone.

606
00:25:22.778 --> 00:25:25.546
Ugh.
I'm exhausted by this drama.

607
00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:27.510
Hey. do you want
to go buy a yacht?

608
00:25:27.646 --> 00:25:28.613
Oh. good idea.

609
00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:31.015
Let's buy matching yachts.

610
00:25:36.122 --> 00:25:41.630
♪ This is for
all the lonely people ♪

611
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:47.966
♪ Thinking that life
has passed us by ♪

612
00:25:49.904 --> 00:25:53.573
♪ We won't give up until we ♪

613
00:25:53.709 --> 00:25:56.744
♪ Drink from the silver cup ♪

614
00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:01.914
♪ And ride that highway
in the sky. ♪

615
00:26:03.346 --> 00:26:05.988
Your ukulele skills
are improving.

616
00:26:06.123 --> 00:26:07.286
Thank you.

617
00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:11.985
Operation Family Harmony

618
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:13.923
is on and poppin'!

619
00:26:14.058 --> 00:26:15.456
- What?
- What? Oh. nothing.

620
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:17.292
I just... Well.
if I didn't know any better.

621
00:26:17.427 --> 00:26:18.830
I'd-I'd almost say
you were excited.

622
00:26:18.966 --> 00:26:21.264
Uh. it has nothing to do
with my brothers.

623
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.765
TINY DIAMOND
All right. All right.

624
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:25.506
Tiny. Branch. Poppy

625
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:27.602
- and this random dude...
- What?

626
00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:30.408
...on another musical adventure
filled with heart. hilarity

627
00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:31.676
and happiness.

628
00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:34.110
Tiny! What are you doing here?

629
00:26:34.245 --> 00:26:36.251
Well. Aunt Poppy.
for your information.

630
00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:37.779
I am no longer a baby.

631
00:26:37.915 --> 00:26:39.446
I am a big boy now.

632
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:42.153
And I'm on
a man-sized rite of passage

633
00:26:42.288 --> 00:26:47.223
to learn lessons of life.
courage and maybe love.

634
00:26:47.823 --> 00:26:48.992
Aw.

635
00:26:49.128 --> 00:26:50.497
Uh. should we be letting
a baby drive?

636
00:26:50.633 --> 00:26:51.931
Not to worry. fellow grown-up.

637
00:26:52.066 --> 00:26:54.961
I have procured
my learner's permit.

638
00:26:55.097 --> 00:26:56.364
Who is Adulty McManface?

639
00:26:56.499 --> 00:27:00.141
The better question is:
Are you a narc?

640
00:27:00.277 --> 00:27:01.374
What? No. No.

641
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.437
Why? Are you?

642
00:27:03.572 --> 00:27:06.278
Enough chitchat.
Adulty McManface. Step on it!

643
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.848
<i>Okay. guys. where was I?</i>

644
00:27:09.984 --> 00:27:11.446
We got to find our brothers
and fast.

645
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.984
But don't worry.
old Branch has got it handled.

646
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.754
All we have to do
is follow the clues.

647
00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:19.391
Wow. Check out your old outfits.

648
00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:20.827
Puffy jackets?

649
00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:22.960
Puka shell necklaces?
Denim tuxedos?!

650
00:27:23.096 --> 00:27:26.333
Branch. did you have
frosted tips?

651
00:27:26.469 --> 00:27:27.996
Yeah. It was an era.

652
00:27:28.132 --> 00:27:30.104
Uh. don't forget his perm.

653
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.165
No way.

654
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.936
Pictures or it didn't happen.

655
00:27:33.072 --> 00:27:35.110
Aah! Look at you!
You were so cute.

656
00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:36.606
I love it.

657
00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:39.381
Uh. but we had to pull the plug

658
00:27:39.516 --> 00:27:41.175
when he tried to frost his perm.

659
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:42.778
- It was an era!

660
00:27:42.913 --> 00:27:44.214
- Tragic.
- Whew.

661
00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:45.652
While you two are
strolling down memory lane.

662
00:27:45.787 --> 00:27:47.252
I'll work on finding Spruce.

663
00:27:47.387 --> 00:27:49.489
I'm gonna need copies
of that pic-- wallet size.

664
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:51.091
Listen. baby brother.

665
00:27:51.226 --> 00:27:52.694
we don't need your little board
to find Spruce.

666
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.692
- It's not little.
- Because I got this.

667
00:27:54.827 --> 00:27:56.590
Ha! Booyah.

668
00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:59.234
A postcard that says
"wish you were here"?

669
00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:00.093
That's it?

670
00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:01.799
It's not even signed.

671
00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:03.433
It's definitely Spruce.

672
00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:05.841
I mean. he's the only one I know
who talks that way.

673
00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:08.102
There's no return address.
It's blank.

674
00:28:08.237 --> 00:28:09.775
This could be from anywhere.

675
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:11.476
We can't find Spruce with this.

676
00:28:11.612 --> 00:28:12.779
Yeah. we can!

677
00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:14.715
All we have to do
is find this sunset.

678
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:16.912
Liking that optimism.
Poppy Seed.

679
00:28:17.047 --> 00:28:19.250
Branch. one word: keeper.

680
00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:22.218
Hey. man. I know about
being treated like a baby.

681
00:28:22.354 --> 00:28:24.359
But while it's just
the two of us.

682
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:25.556
you want some of this?

683
00:28:25.692 --> 00:28:27.256
Nah. Thanks. man.

684
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.823
I-I can't get back
on that train.

685
00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:30.327
Suit yourself.

686
00:28:30.462 --> 00:28:31.998
- I mean. hey. look at this.

687
00:28:32.134 --> 00:28:33.361
We're never gonna find Spruce
with this.

688
00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:36.571
I bet this sunset
doesn't even exist.

689
00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:38.600
Oh. hot dog!

690
00:28:38.736 --> 00:28:40.142
Ah. man.

691
00:28:40.277 --> 00:28:41.601
Of course.

692
00:28:41.737 --> 00:28:43.843
Hey. guys.
You're gonna want to see this.

693
00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:45.645
- I knew we'd find it.

694
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:47.448
Spruce must be on that island.

695
00:28:47.584 --> 00:28:48.910
Whoa! Easy there. goggles.

696
00:28:49.045 --> 00:28:50.046
All right. y'all.

697
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:51.045
- Let's mobilize.
- Yeah!

698
00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:53.019
Pedal to the metal. JD.

699
00:28:56.152 --> 00:28:57.252
What are you doing?

700
00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:58.860
Worry not. friends.

701
00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:00.455
Rhonda here's
completely waterproof.

702
00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:22.615
Oh. Grissy. this is
the most romantic honeymoon

703
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.812
I've ever been on.

704
00:29:24.947 --> 00:29:26.116
Ever.

705
00:29:26.252 --> 00:29:28.184
Whoo!
It is a night of surprises.

706
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.925
- Whoa!

707
00:29:32.462 --> 00:29:34.293
To the water park!

708
00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:36.095
Woo-hoo!

709
00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:45.606
Good old Rhonda.

710
00:29:45.741 --> 00:29:48.403
Completely waterproof. huh?

711
00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:50.040
So. um. John Dory.
who wrote that song

712
00:29:50.175 --> 00:29:51.413
"Girl. I Love Your Love. Girl"?

713
00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:52.739
- I did.
- Cool.

714
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:53.943
Who wrote. um. "Girl.
You Break My Heart. Girl"?

715
00:29:54.078 --> 00:29:55.542
- I did.
- So cool.

716
00:29:55.677 --> 00:29:57.149
Who wrote
"Girl. I Love Your Love. Girl.

717
00:29:57.284 --> 00:29:58.612
"You Break My Heart. Girl.
I Still Love You.

718
00:29:58.748 --> 00:29:59.917
"But I Seriously Think
We Should Have a Talk

719
00:30:00.053 --> 00:30:01.216
About Our Relationship. Girl"?

720
00:30:01.352 --> 00:30:02.649
- Oh. that was Branch.
- Shut up!

721
00:30:02.784 --> 00:30:04.017
That was my favorite
BroZone song. like. ever.

722
00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:05.324
JK. Also me.

723
00:30:06.355 --> 00:30:08.494
Branch has never written a song.

724
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.031
I was a baby.

725
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.632
What did you want me
to write about. diaper rash?

726
00:30:11.767 --> 00:30:14.331
Okay. take it easy. Bitty B.

727
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.867
- Hey. what's wrong?

728
00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:18.168
Nothing. Super happy.

729
00:30:18.304 --> 00:30:20.270
This is our most fun
mission yet. Yay.

730
00:30:20.406 --> 00:30:23.373
Branch. do you know
how lucky you are?

731
00:30:23.508 --> 00:30:25.276
A brother is a friend
who can never leave you.

732
00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:27.082
It's the strongest bond
in the world.

733
00:30:27.217 --> 00:30:29.410
I would kill to have a sibling
to sing with. Branch.

734
00:30:29.546 --> 00:30:32.386
Yeah. well. you can have mine.

735
00:30:32.521 --> 00:30:34.487
Okay. Fine.

736
00:30:34.622 --> 00:30:36.084
Poppy. wait.

737
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.086
Grown-up stuff.

738
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:39.654
Am I right?

739
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.458
You know. I still got
that thang. if you want it.

740
00:30:41.594 --> 00:30:45.098
Whoa. whoa. Don't be waving
that thing around.

741
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.495
All right. y'all.

742
00:30:47.631 --> 00:30:48.998
We're getting close
to something.

743
00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:52.006
I can feel it.

744
00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:54.670
- Whoa. What do we got here?

745
00:30:54.806 --> 00:30:57.838
Hey. guys. looks like I found
some fellow rock climbers.

746
00:30:57.974 --> 00:30:58.908

Don't ask why.

Fricassee squid
and one jellyfish slider.

774
00:32:17.387 --> 00:32:18.653
- Spruce. wait.
- Huh?

775
00:32:18.788 --> 00:32:20.557
Oh. no. I knew
this would happen one day.

776
00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:22.460
Listen. I know you recognize me
from BroZone.

777
00:32:22.595 --> 00:32:24.560
and I'm happy to give you
an autograph or whatever.

778
00:32:24.695 --> 00:32:26.331
but can you please
be discreet about it?

779
00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:28.834
Spruce. it's us.
It's your brothers.

780
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.538
Whoa.

781
00:32:30.674 --> 00:32:31.598
- Bitty B!
- What?

782
00:32:31.734 --> 00:32:33.372
- Whoa.

783
00:32:33.508 --> 00:32:35.505
No tossing. okay?
Too big to be tossed.

784
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.208
The last time I saw you.
you were in diapers.

785
00:32:38.343 --> 00:32:39.778
- Diapers. Right.

786
00:32:39.913 --> 00:32:40.914
Wet willy!

787
00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:42.582
Stop it. That's disgusting.

788
00:32:42.717 --> 00:32:43.847
I am a grown-up.

789
00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:44.980
Oh. sorry.

790
00:32:45.116 --> 00:32:46.517
A wet William.

791
00:32:46.652 --> 00:32:48.088
Hi. Spruce. I'm Poppy.
Wow. it's. like...

792
00:32:48.224 --> 00:32:49.723
It's so cool to meet you
or whatever.

793
00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:51.024
Um. this is Tiny Diamond.

794
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.423
Hey. what's up?

795
00:32:52.558 --> 00:32:54.288
Killer nachos you got here.
by the way.

796
00:32:54.424 --> 00:32:55.956
- Yeah!
- All right.

797
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:57.726
Okay. Spruce. We're here
because Floyd needs our...

798
00:32:57.862 --> 00:32:59.292
Actually. no one's
called me Spruce in years.

799
00:32:59.427 --> 00:33:00.494
I go by Bruce now.

800
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.836
I'm sorry. did you say "Bruce"?

801
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:03.402
Yeah. I wanted to put the whole

802
00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:06.335
"boy band" thing behind me
now that I'm a dad.

803
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:08.340
Wait a minute. You're a father?

804
00:33:08.476 --> 00:33:10.742
Yeah. I can't wait for you
to meet everyone.

805
00:33:10.877 --> 00:33:12.079
Hi. honey.

806
00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:13.878
These are my brothers. unexpectedly.

807
00:33:14.014 --> 00:33:15.775
Oh. Oh! Oh. hello there.

808
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:18.312
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

809
00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:19.780
- Hi! -Hey.
- Hello.

810
00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.886
This is my wife
and business partner Brandy.

811
00:33:22.022 --> 00:33:23.757
She is my soulmate.

812
00:33:23.892 --> 00:33:25.120
My very tall soulmate.

813
00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:26.426
But we make it work.

814
00:33:26.562 --> 00:33:28.228
How?

815
00:33:28.363 --> 00:33:29.824
We don't even really know
how it works.

816
00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:31.227
I'm kidding. I'm-I'm not.

817
00:33:31.363 --> 00:33:32.527
I'm... I don't know.

818
00:33:32.663 --> 00:33:33.834
Daddy. Daddy.
can I have a cookie?

819
00:33:33.969 --> 00:33:35.134
Becoming a dad was like a...

820
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.971
like a seismic shift
in my brain.

821
00:33:37.107 --> 00:33:38.703
- Daddy. Bruce Jr. bit me.
- No biting.

822
00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:41.269
Daddy. I don't see how
any government stands a chance.

823
00:33:41.405 --> 00:33:42.570
You're not wrong. kid.

824
00:33:42.706 --> 00:33:44.109
I'm stuck
in this ketchup bottle.

825
00:33:44.244 --> 00:33:45.575
Okay. Gonna handle all of that.

826
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.848
Just give Daddy
two seconds. okay? Love you.

827
00:33:47.983 --> 00:33:49.179
As a dad...

828
00:33:49.314 --> 00:33:50.683
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. guess what!

829
00:33:50.818 --> 00:33:52.020
I have pink eye.

830
00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:53.587
- Oh. my. Pink eye.

831
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:54.681
Oh. (bleep)!

832
00:33:54.817 --> 00:33:56.121
Look. Spruce.
got to cut to the chase.

833
00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.487
We're not here to catch up.

834
00:33:57.623 --> 00:33:58.826
We're here because
we need to hit

835
00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:00.293
the perfect family harmony.

836
00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:02.195
Oh. no. You're still
going on about that?

837
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:03.859
Hey. Get these guys
their meals to go.

838
00:34:03.995 --> 00:34:05.926
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
You don't understand.

839
00:34:06.061 --> 00:34:08.565
It's for Floyd.
He's being held captive.

840
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.431
What? Well. then.
wh-what are we waiting for?

841
00:34:10.566 --> 00:34:11.898
We need to call the authorities.

842
00:34:12.034 --> 00:34:13.467
Hit the perfect family
harmony. ye...

843
00:34:13.602 --> 00:34:15.342
Spruce. it-it has to be us.

844
00:34:15.478 --> 00:34:18.476
Floyd's being held captive
in a diamond prison.

845
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.443
Oh. Well. yeah. you need

846
00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:22.113
the perfect family harmony
for that.

847
00:34:22.249 --> 00:34:23.977
- Exactly.
- Wait. But how?

848
00:34:24.113 --> 00:34:26.187
We've never even come close
to pulling it off.

849
00:34:26.323 --> 00:34:28.689
You do remember our last show.
don't you?

850
00:34:28.824 --> 00:34:30.455
If we practice.

851
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:32.823
I know we'll be able to nail it.
We have to.

852
00:34:32.958 --> 00:34:35.229
At my age?
I really don't think that...

853
00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:38.231
See. guys?
I told you Dad wasn't in a band.

854
00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:40.663
Oh. I was in a band.
I was in the band.

855
00:34:40.798 --> 00:34:42.969
You ask your mother
if I was in a band.

856
00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:46.240
Oh. he was in a band.

857
00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:49.209
Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!

858
00:34:49.344 --> 00:34:50.807
- Prove it! Prove it!
- Oh. all right.

859
00:34:50.942 --> 00:34:52.010
- I'll-I'll prove it.

860
00:34:52.146 --> 00:34:53.412
I'll prove it right now.

861
00:34:53.547 --> 00:34:55.409
- Yes! Bring it in. brother.

862
00:34:55.544 --> 00:34:57.049
Branch. get up there.

863
00:34:57.184 --> 00:34:58.450
Go sing with your brothers.

864
00:34:58.585 --> 00:35:00.321
I'll do it to save Floyd
when I have to.

865
00:35:00.456 --> 00:35:02.751
but I'm not doing it right now
just for funsies.

866
00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:04.385
Oh. yeah. Okay.
You're probably right.

867
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:05.987
No. no. no. no. no. no.

868
00:35:06.122 --> 00:35:07.824
You're the one who...
Wait. What'd you say?

869
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.198
No. you're afraid that singing
with your brothers again

870
00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.793
after all these years
will overwhelm you

871
00:35:11.929 --> 00:35:13.599
with emotions too powerful
for you to handle.

872
00:35:13.734 --> 00:35:15.398
I-I agree with you.

873

946
00:38:19.254 --> 00:38:20.747

Crimp. honey.
that's not an idea.

951
00:38:28.295 --> 00:38:29.423
Those are shoulder pads.

952
00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:30.593
I beg to differ.

953
00:38:30.728 --> 00:38:32.226

right in here.

958
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:43.874

essence through here.

973
00:39:24.786 --> 00:39:27.413

00:39:27.549 --> 00:39:29.917
Girl. we grew up in the suburbs.
Our parents were dentists.

Our parents were nobodies.
and we were nobodies.

978
00:39:38.128 --> 00:39:39.930
And when I met you.
you were literally

979
00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:42.798
sucking your thumb
and pooping all over the place.

980
00:39:42.933 --> 00:39:44.699
You met me
when I was a baby. so...

981
00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:46.806
All over the place. It was nuts!

982
00:39:46.942 --> 00:39:49.135
You don't want to give up
all the yachts and the bling

983
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.339
and your illegal pet monkey.
do you?

984
00:39:51.474 --> 00:39:54.047
Okay.
I've made my peace with it.

985
00:39:54.182 --> 00:39:55.348
Great job. Cringe.

986
00:39:55.483 --> 00:39:57.282
You're smarter than I thought.

987
00:39:57.418 --> 00:39:58.650
Now I don't trust you.

988
00:39:58.786 --> 00:40:00.348
That's maybe not
a rational response.

989
00:40:00.483 --> 00:40:01.581
I don't. um... Please don't
put me in the closet.

Too much hustle is a thing.

1057
00:42:40.909 --> 00:42:43.314
Huh. Look at that.

1058
00:42:51.189 --> 00:42:54.890
Are we sure
this is where Clay lives?

1059
00:42:55.025 --> 00:42:56.456
Are we sure?

1060
00:42:56.592 --> 00:43:00.300
Our GPS is an armadillo bus
sniffing used undies.

1061
00:43:00.436 --> 00:43:02.329
so no. we're not sure.

1062
00:43:05.236 --> 00:43:06.807
I think this is the place from

1063
00:43:06.942 --> 00:43:09.237
every true crime podcast
I've ever listened to.

1064
00:43:19.986 --> 00:43:23.289
Halt! Who goes there?

1065
00:43:27.423 --> 00:43:31.024
Who dares trespass
on these sacred grounds?

1066
00:43:31.159 --> 00:43:33.362
Branch. what are you doing?

1067
00:43:33.498 --> 00:43:39.037
Listen. we don't want
any clown-related trouble. okay?

1068
00:43:39.173 --> 00:43:41.676
We're just here looking
for our brother Clay.

1069
00:43:43.477 --> 00:43:45.509
Wait a second.

1070
00:43:45.644 --> 00:43:47.479
You're trolls?

1071
00:43:47.615 --> 00:43:49.915
So what? You're a clown.

1072
00:43:53.254 --> 00:43:54.788
Oh!

1073
00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.653
Oh. my gosh.

1074
00:43:59.788 --> 00:44:01.227
Hello!

1075
00:44:01.362 --> 00:44:02.961
My name is Viva.

1076
00:44:03.097 --> 00:44:06.663
It is so fantastamazing
to see other trolls.

1077
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.870
- Hi. Ha!

1078
00:44:10.005 --> 00:44:12.871
So. "fantastamazing" is
my own personal word.

1079
00:44:13.006 --> 00:44:14.907
It means. um.
fantastic and amazing.

1080
00:44:15.042 --> 00:44:16.871
I used to say "amastic."
but then I was like.

1081
00:44:17.007 --> 00:44:18.178
"Mm. that's not as good."

1082
00:44:18.314 --> 00:44:20.043
Fantastamawesome!

1083
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:21.842
That's different.
but that works. too.

1084
00:44:21.978 --> 00:44:23.278
Way to make it your own.

1085
00:44:23.413 --> 00:44:24.980
Is this how people feel
when they meet me?

1086
00:44:25.115 --> 00:44:26.485
- Yes.
- Am I being a lot?

1087
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.920
Sometimes I can be a lot.

1088
00:44:28.055 --> 00:44:29.689
I'm not sure
we're in the right place.

1089
00:44:29.824 --> 00:44:31.052
Course you're in
the right place.

1090
00:44:31.187 --> 00:44:32.685
Any troll is welcome here
with us.

1091
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:37.131
Okay. Putt Putt trolls.
lights on for our new friends.

1092
00:44:42.297 --> 00:44:43.804
Wow.
Ooh.

1093
00:44:43.939 --> 00:44:46.534
Oh. my gosh. Are you guys
hungry? Are you thirsty?

1094
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.839
Yes!

1095
00:44:47.975 --> 00:44:48.935
Fries? Fries?
You guys want fries.

1096
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.171
I am seeing fries.

1097
00:44:50.306 --> 00:44:52.279
- Bring out the works.
- Fries!

1098
00:44:52.415 --> 00:44:54.409
Milkshakes to celebrate.

1099
00:44:54.544 --> 00:44:57.312
- Coming in hot!
Whoa!

1100
00:44:58.917 --> 00:45:00.048
Whoo! That's better.

1101
00:45:00.183 --> 00:45:02.148
Now I finally have some energy!

1102
00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:03.690
Did you just braid my hair?

1103
00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.152
You're welcome.
It looks so good.

1104
00:45:05.287 --> 00:45:06.821
- I love it!
Wow.

1105
00:45:06.957 --> 00:45:08.257
These fries are amazing.

1106
00:45:08.392 --> 00:45:10.124
They'd really go great
with a burger.

1107
00:45:13.534 --> 00:45:15.496
What is happening?

1108
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:17.534
Yeah. we try not to use
that word around here.

1109
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.199
It's just that "burger" sounds
a little too much like. uh...

1110
00:45:20.335 --> 00:45:21.607
"Bergens."

1111
00:45:23.043 --> 00:45:26.741

00:45:28.511 --> 00:45:30.080
- Clay?
- Clay. Hey. what's up. man?

1114
00:45:30.215 --> 00:45:32.449
Hey. How you been. man?

1115
00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:33.517
Clay!

1116
00:45:33.652 --> 00:45:34.649
Hmm. John.

1117
00:45:34.784 --> 00:45:35.686
Wha...

1118
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:38.052
Spruce. What do you know?

1119
00:45:38.187 --> 00:45:39.889
Actually. I go by Bruce now.

1120
00:45:40.025 --> 00:45:42.495
Bruce. Oh. someone got fancy.

1121
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:43.997
- I like it.

1122
00:45:44.132 --> 00:45:46.294
Look who's talking.
Is that a sweater romper?

1123
00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:48.369
What can I say?
When you co-run a place.

1124
00:45:48.504 --> 00:45:49.562
got to flex the drip.

1125
00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:51.234
Yeah. I'm the fun side
of the operation.

1126
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.969
and Mr. Clay takes care
of the boring stuff.

1127
00:45:53.104 --> 00:45:54.434
- Guilty.

1128
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.976
- Whoa! Baby Branch?

1129
00:45:57.111 --> 00:45:58.810
- No way.
- Actually. it's Big Branch now.

1130
00:45:58.945 --> 00:46:00.779
- Or just Branch.

1131
00:46:00.914 --> 00:46:02.245
- Branch is fine.
- Come here.

1132
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.212
- Come here. Aw. yeah.
-  Yeah.

1133
00:46:04.348 --> 00:46:06.479
- So. Clay. this is Poppy.
- Hi. Clay.

1134
00:46:06.614 --> 00:46:08.286
- So great to finally meet you.
- Whoa!

1135
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:10.619
Can you do the Rusty Robot
for me?

1136
00:46:10.754 --> 00:46:12.054
Yeah. no.

1137
00:46:12.189 --> 00:46:13.586
I don't do that anymore. okay?

1138
00:46:13.722 --> 00:46:15.356
Right. Kidding.
Can you imagine?

1139
00:46:15.492 --> 00:46:17.092
I wouldn't just
ask you to do that

1140
00:46:17.227 --> 00:46:18.926
after meeting you
two seconds ago.

1141
00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:20.462
Who would do that?

1142
00:46:20.597 --> 00:46:22.200
Yeah. it's just that
Fun Boy Clay is dead.

1143
00:46:22.335 --> 00:46:25.768
Serious Boy Clay only does
the Well-Oiled Robot.

1144
00:46:25.903 --> 00:46:27.335
and it is no...

1145
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.269
...fun.

1146
00:46:29.404 --> 00:46:31.007
I mean. that's still pretty fun.

1147
00:46:31.142 --> 00:46:33.007
Yeah. same old Clay.

1148
00:46:33.143 --> 00:46:34.409
No. that's not true.

1149
00:46:34.544 --> 00:46:36.948
If I was still fun.
would I have chosen

1150
00:46:37.084 --> 00:46:39.649
the admin building
as my bedroom?

1151
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.119
Huh? Huh?

1152
00:46:43.255 --> 00:46:45.420
Asking the tough questions. guys.

1153
00:46:45.555 --> 00:46:48.060
- Asking the tough questions.
- Oh. right.

1154
00:46:48.195 --> 00:46:50.530
Anyway. I can't believe
you all are here.

1155
00:46:50.666 --> 00:46:51.962
Wait. where's Floyd?

1156
00:46:52.097 --> 00:46:53.428
That's why we're here.

1157
00:46:53.564 --> 00:46:55.166
Floyd's been taken prisoner
in Mount Rageous

1158
00:46:55.301 --> 00:46:57.170
by superstar singers
Velvet and Veneer...

1159
00:46:57.306 --> 00:46:59.606
...and the only thing
powerful enough to free him

1160
00:46:59.742 --> 00:47:01.237
is the perfect family harmony.

1161
00:47:01.372 --> 00:47:04.041
Okay. either they just
made that up.

1162
00:47:04.177 --> 00:47:06.377
or I have not been
paying attention.

1163
00:47:06.513 --> 00:47:08.274
Well. why haven't you just
called the authorities?

1164
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.916
Oh. unless Floyd is being held

1165
00:47:11.052 --> 00:47:13.320
in an impenetrable
diamond prison.

1166
00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:14.614
Yeah. that.

1167
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:16.453
I'm in.
I'd also like to volunteer

1168
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:19.126
to keep track of our expenses.
just 'cause I think

1169
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:21.053
you're gonna need somebody
to be on top of that.

1170
00:47:21.189 --> 00:47:23.791
Yeah. I don't think you'll get
any pushback on that front.

1171
00:47:23.926 --> 00:47:27.332
Great. but we need to leave
for Mount Rageous. like. now.

1172
00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:29.363
You can't leave now.
You just got here. Come on.

1173
00:47:29.499 --> 00:47:31.502
- Let me show you around.

1174
00:47:31.637 --> 00:47:32.605
Hug time!

1175
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:33.768
- Uh...

1176
00:47:33.903 --> 00:47:34.902
Yeah. no.

1177
00:47:35.037 --> 00:47:36.372
Aw. so cute.

1178
00:47:36.508 --> 00:47:38.237
Where'd you get
that hug time bracelet?

1179
00:47:38.372 --> 00:47:39.778
My dad gave it to me.

1180
00:47:39.913 --> 00:47:42.344
Okay. this is so totally random.

1181
00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:44.682
but I used to have one
just like it.

1182
00:47:44.817 --> 00:47:46.213
Can I see that?

1183
00:47:46.348 --> 00:47:48.321
Wow. It fits you perfectly.

1184
00:47:48.456 --> 00:47:49.517
Yeah.

1185
00:47:55.628 --> 00:47:57.564
Whoa.

1186
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.129
I'm sorry.

1187
00:47:59.265 --> 00:48:01.566
What did you say
your name was again?

1188
00:48:01.702 --> 00:48:03.102
I'm Poppy.

1189
00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:05.236
Poppy?

1190
00:48:16.251 --> 00:48:18.883
Okay. um. another
totally random. weird question.

1191
00:48:19.018 --> 00:48:22.957
but is your dad King Peppy?

1192
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:25.624
Uh. yeah.

1193
00:48:25.759 --> 00:48:27.188
You're...

1194
00:48:27.324 --> 00:48:28.655
You're-you're alive!

1195
00:48:28.791 --> 00:48:30.997
- I'm alive.
This is unbelievable!

1196
00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:33.164
I never thought
I'd see you again.

1197
00:48:33.299 --> 00:48:35.962
- Again?
- Poppy. it's me. Viva.

1198
00:48:36.097 --> 00:48:37.064
Uh...

1199
00:48:37.199 --> 00:48:38.801
I'm your sister.

1200
00:48:38.937 --> 00:48:40.739
My... my what?

1201
00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:42.809
Your sister. Your hermana.

1202
00:48:42.944 --> 00:48:44.242
- Whoa.
Hey. man.

1203
00:48:44.377 --> 00:48:46.813
Am I the only one
without a long-lost sibling?

1204
00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:48.178
What do you mean we're sisters?

1205
00:48:48.314 --> 00:48:49.843
H-How could I have not
known about you?

1206
00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:51.884
I can't believe Dad didn't
tell me I have a sister.

1207
00:48:52.019 --> 00:48:53.648
- That is so Dad.
- So Dad.

1208
00:48:53.783 --> 00:48:55.286
Aah! I can't...
I can't believe this.

1209
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:56.949
I've always dreamt
of having a sister.

1210
00:48:57.085 --> 00:48:58.853
I was just saying this.
Wasn't I just saying this?

1211
00:48:58.988 --> 00:49:00.355
This means we can plan
each other's birthday parties.

1212
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:01.820
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. and weddings.
- Yes!

1213
00:49:01.956 --> 00:49:03.859
My best friend Bridget
just had her wedding.

1214
00:49:03.995 --> 00:49:05.627
and it went off without a hitch
'cause I was. like. the best

1215
00:49:05.763 --> 00:49:07.398
maid of honor. -You'd be
the best maid of honor.

1216
00:49:07.534 --> 00:49:09.269
You and Bridget
are gonna love each other!

1217
00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:10.430
Oh. my gosh. I'm gonna love her.

So. I was thinking about
getting more into. like.

1258
00:50:40.759 --> 00:50:43.161
reading short stories and essays
instead of full novels.

1259
00:50:43.297 --> 00:50:45.760
- Ooh. I love that for you.
- Yeah.

1260
00:50:45.895 --> 00:50:47.894
But. um... but just to
circle back real quick.

1261
00:50:48.029 --> 00:50:51.301
I still have a million questions
about what happened.

1262
00:50:51.437 --> 00:50:52.466
I used to live
at the Troll Tree.

1263
00:50:52.601 --> 00:50:53.932
I was there when you were born.

1264
00:50:54.068 --> 00:50:55.668
And you were so cute.
kind of like you are now.

1265
00:50:55.804 --> 00:50:57.708
only teensier
and weensier and...

1266
00:50:57.844 --> 00:51:00.242
Oh. Do you want to make candy
necklaces that we never finish

1267
00:51:00.378 --> 00:51:01.977
because we eat all the candy?

1268
00:51:02.112 --> 00:51:03.347
Obviously!

1269
00:51:03.483 --> 00:51:05.317
But. Veev.
I'm just gonna need you

1270
00:51:05.452 --> 00:51:07.714
to focus here
and-and tell me everything.

1271
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:09.919
Why am I only learning
about you now?

1272
00:51:10.055 --> 00:51:11.356
What happened?

1273
00:51:11.491 --> 00:51:13.558
We got accidentally separated.

1274
00:51:13.693 --> 00:51:15.593
And I've lived here ever since.

1275
00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:16.797
The end.

1276
00:51:16.932 --> 00:51:18.095
Want to do candy toe rings next?

1277
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.463
Uh. accidentally separated?

1278
00:51:20.598 --> 00:51:22.402
Viva doesn't like
to talk about it--

1279
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.502
it's too painful for her--
but she's been here

1280
00:51:24.637 --> 00:51:26.804
ever since the night
of the great Bergen attack.

1281
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:29.503
Viva. are you talking
about the night

1282
00:51:29.638 --> 00:51:31.907
the trolls escaped Bergen Town?

1283
00:51:32.042 --> 00:51:33.308
Oh. Yeah.

1284
00:51:33.443 --> 00:51:35.274
Yeah. I guess it was that night.

1285
00:51:37.318 --> 00:51:39.679
Not everyone made it out
of that tree.

1286
00:51:39.815 --> 00:51:41.549
Some of them got trapped
by Bergens.

1287
00:51:41.685 --> 00:51:43.423
They were this close
to getting eaten.

1288
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.588
until Viva and some of the
other trolls fought them off.

1289
00:51:48.128 --> 00:51:49.928
But by then.

1290
00:51:50.064 --> 00:51:51.362
the tunnels had collapsed.

1291
00:51:51.497 --> 00:51:53.298
and they were cut off
from the rest.

1292
00:51:53.434 --> 00:51:55.995
I kept screaming.
"No troll left behind!"

1293
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.603
But when I went back in.
the tunnels had collapsed.

1294
00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:02.672
That's when I found
Viva's hug time bracelet.

1295
00:52:02.807 --> 00:52:05.707
Viva found this old.
abandoned Bergen golf course

1296
00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:07.875
and transformed it
into this troll utopia.

1297
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.845
We formed this little sanctuary
of survivors.

1298
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:13.617
I added fire exits.
She added her heart and soul.

1299
00:52:13.753 --> 00:52:15.818
I've thought so many times
about leaving. you know.

1300
00:52:15.954 --> 00:52:20.427
to look for you and Dad.
but it's not safe out there.

1301
00:52:20.563 --> 00:52:24.996
I know I should've told Poppy.
but my heart was broken.

1302
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:26.462
I felt like a failure.

1303
00:52:26.597 --> 00:52:29.361
not just as a king
but as a father.

1304
00:52:29.497 --> 00:52:30.937
I feel so guilty.

1305
00:52:31.073 --> 00:52:32.371
What do you think I should do?

1306
00:52:32.506 --> 00:52:35.340
I'm afraid that's
our time for today.

1307
00:52:35.475 --> 00:52:38.212
But I just revealed
a major trauma.

1308
00:52:41.215 --> 00:52:43.716
Okay. Obviously. this is a lot.

1309
00:52:43.851 --> 00:52:45.914
and you should be able to open
up about this on your own time.

1310
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:47.954
but we'll have plenty of time
to work through this

1311
00:52:48.089 --> 00:52:49.521
on the way to Mount Rageous.

1312
00:52:49.657 --> 00:52:51.617
Whoa. I am not
going to Mount Rageous.

1313
00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:53.356
And neither are you. silly.

1314
00:52:53.492 --> 00:52:55.922
You're never gonna leave again.

1315
00:52:57.999 --> 00:52:59.162
Wait. what was the...

1316
00:52:59.297 --> 00:53:00.630
What was that last thing?

1317
00:53:00.765 --> 00:53:02.836
Okay. guys.
if we're gonna save Floyd.

1318
00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:03.969
we need to get going.

1319
00:53:04.104 --> 00:53:05.135
I'll go get Poppy.

1320
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:06.603
No. no. no. wait. Hold on.

1321
00:53:06.739 --> 00:53:08.505
There's no way
Viva's gonna let her go.

1322
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.443
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?

1323
00:53:10.579 --> 00:53:12.644
Like I said. she's got
some stuff going on. man.

1324
00:53:12.779 --> 00:53:16.078
If we don't want to get trapped.
we should sneak out now.

1325
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.025
Ah. hey. Viva.

1326
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.423
What's up. girl?

1327
00:53:29.558 --> 00:53:31.024
Viva. what are you doing?

1328
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.828
You're not leaving here.
no matter what. because...

1329
00:53:33.963 --> 00:53:35.934
because it's just not safe
out there.

1330
00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:37.003
You're welcome.

1331
00:53:37.138 --> 00:53:38.303
Wait. is this about the Bergens?

1332
00:53:38.439 --> 00:53:40.336
Because they stopped
trying to eat us.

1333
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.703
That's all in the past.

1334
00:53:41.839 --> 00:53:43.371
Yeah. right.
That's hilarious. Poppy.

1335
00:53:43.507 --> 00:53:44.570
I'm laughing really hard.

1336
00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:46.038
I'm serious. Viva.

1337
00:53:46.174 --> 00:53:48.243
Bridget. my best friend
I was telling you about.

1338
00:53:48.379 --> 00:53:49.846
she's a Bergen.

1339
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:51.779
Look. Bridget and I do
a million fun things together.

1340
00:53:51.914 --> 00:53:54.220
We talk and we play games
and we sing songs

1341
00:53:54.356 --> 00:53:56.153
and make up
these really bad dances.

1342
00:53:56.289 --> 00:53:58.022
It's a lot like...

1343
00:53:58.157 --> 00:54:00.252
Well. actually. it's a lot like
what you and I have been doing.

1344
00:54:00.387 --> 00:54:02.954
The world's a lot different
than it used to be.

1345
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.695
Viva. look. I used to be
just like you.

1346
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.166
I built a bunker.
and I lived in it for years

1347
00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:09.663
because I knew it was safe.

1348
00:54:09.798 --> 00:54:12.632
And. sure. it-it kept me alive.

1349
00:54:12.768 --> 00:54:16.142
and I never had to wear pants.

1350
00:54:16.277 --> 00:54:19.979
but I was living without pants.

1351
00:54:20.114 --> 00:54:21.144
Does that make sense?

1352
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.242
Well. I feel judged.

1353
00:54:23.377 --> 00:54:26.217
You don't understand.
I just got my sister back.

1354
00:54:26.352 --> 00:54:28.183
I'm not gonna lose you.

1355
00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:30.456
For anything.

1356
00:54:33.454 --> 00:54:34.756
Clay?

1357
00:54:34.892 --> 00:54:37.892
I'm sorry. Viva.
but we have to leave.

1358
00:54:38.028 --> 00:54:40.697
I don't want to lose
my brother. either.

1359
00:54:43.004 --> 00:54:44.338
Let's move!

1360
00:54:45.172 --> 00:54:48.067
No. No. Poppy. wait!

1361
00:54:51.474 --> 00:54:53.908
Poppy. please!

1362
00:54:54.775 --> 00:54:56.543
I want you to stay.

1363
00:54:56.679 --> 00:54:58.446
Viva. I can't do that.

1364
00:54:58.581 --> 00:55:00.046
But you can come with us.

1365
00:55:00.182 --> 00:55:02.418
And I know you think it's risky.
and maybe it is.

1366
00:55:02.553 --> 00:55:04.320
but it'll be worth it.

1367
00:55:04.456 --> 00:55:06.525
Family's always worth it.

1368
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:11.126
No. no. no. I...

1369
00:55:11.262 --> 00:55:12.465
I can't.

1370
00:55:37.417 --> 00:55:39.826
Knock. knock.

1371
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:41.026
Almost showtime.

1372
00:55:41.162 --> 00:55:43.161
Ugh. No sign of BroZone?

1373
00:55:43.297 --> 00:55:45.426
No. but I have an idea.

1374
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:48.164
We could practice.

1375
00:55:48.299 --> 00:55:51.968
I want to be famous.
but I'm not gonna work for it.

1376
00:55:52.104 --> 00:55:53.331
Ew.

1377
00:55:53.467 --> 00:55:55.371
Come on. We used to make up
little dances together

1378
00:55:55.507 --> 00:55:56.702
all the time. remember?

1379
00:55:56.837 --> 00:55:58.472
Hip. hip. Twist. flip.

1380
00:55:58.607 --> 00:55:59.841
Our dances sucked.

1381
00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:01.641
How many fans
do you think we can get

1382
00:56:01.777 --> 00:56:03.443
making up sucky dances?

1383
00:56:03.578 --> 00:56:05.017
Hey. hello.

1384
00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:07.183
Hello in there. Wake up.

1385
00:56:07.318 --> 00:56:09.022
Wakey-wakey. Oh.

1386
00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:10.390
He's dead? Oh. man.

1387
00:56:10.526 --> 00:56:12.122
What have we done?

1388
00:56:12.258 --> 00:56:13.822
What do we do?

1389
00:56:13.957 --> 00:56:15.962
You remember the goldfish
you had as a kid?

1390
00:56:16.097 --> 00:56:17.530
You mean Sparkles?

1391
00:56:19.234 --> 00:56:20.531
Mm-kay. Goodbye. little guy.

1392
00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:21.863
Please hurry up and flush.

1393
00:56:21.998 --> 00:56:23.535
Being this close to you
next to a toilet

1394
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.637
- makes me uncomfortable.

1395
00:56:27.268 --> 00:56:29.840
Wow. I thought ghosts
just floated away.

1396
00:56:29.975 --> 00:56:31.638
Well. don't just stand there.
Go get him!

1397
00:56:31.774 --> 00:56:33.040
Why does it have to be me?

1398
00:56:33.175 --> 00:56:34.714
Because Crimp's locked
in the closet.

1399
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:35.708
Now. go!

1400
00:56:35.844 --> 00:56:37.717
Help! Help!

1401
00:56:38.753 --> 00:56:40.513
- Help me. please.

1402
00:56:42.022 --> 00:56:43.219
Help!

1403
00:56:46.723 --> 00:56:48.989
- Gotcha.

1404
00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:51.529
Please. Veneer.
just let me run past you.

1405
00:56:51.664 --> 00:56:53.365
You can pretend
you never saw me.

1406
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.128
It-it'll be our little secret.

1407
00:56:56.235 --> 00:56:57.236
I can't.

1408
00:56:57.372 --> 00:57:00.065
I know. Velvet would kill you.

1409
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.006
But just because
she's your sister

1410
00:57:02.142 --> 00:57:04.940
doesn't mean you should let her
treat you like garbage.

1411
00:57:05.776 --> 00:57:07.307
- Doesn't it?
- No.

1412
00:57:07.443 --> 00:57:10.110
Sibling or not. you deserve
to be treated with kindness

1413
00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:12.384
and to be around people
who would never try

1414
00:57:12.519 --> 00:57:14.385
to change the you that you are.

1415
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.186
You got him.

1416
00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:22.288
Hey. I know I probably don't
say this enough. but good job.

1417
00:57:22.423 --> 00:57:25.257
We really make a great team.
don't we. bro?

1418
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.302
Now. come on. We should also
probably hire a new assistant.

1419
00:57:30.437 --> 00:57:32.371
which feels like a you job.

1420
00:57:32.506 --> 00:57:35.505
Crimp! Hire us a new assistant!

1421
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.641
I'm on it.

Let's do it again from the top.

1438
00:58:17.015 --> 00:58:18.644
Spruce. I want some smolder
in those eyes.

1439
00:58:18.779 --> 00:58:21.287
Clay. you're being too stiff.
We need some sillier robot.

1440
00:58:21.422 --> 00:58:23.019
Bitty B. maybe a smaller diaper.

1441
00:58:23.154 --> 00:58:24.988
If this diaper was any smaller.
I could taste it.

1442
00:58:25.123 --> 00:58:27.019
That's why I don't wear
one of those.

1443
00:58:27.154 --> 00:58:29.159
It's a hard fit to pull off.

1444
00:58:29.295 --> 00:58:31.662
Really great note. John Dory.
Super helpful. Thanks. Thanks.

1445
00:58:31.797 --> 00:58:33.461
Now I have
a creative note for you.

1446
00:58:33.597 --> 00:58:34.696
Stop being bossy!

1447
00:58:34.832 --> 00:58:36.261
What? I'm not being bossy.

1448
00:58:36.396 --> 00:58:38.331
- I'm helping us be better.
- No.

1449
00:58:38.466 --> 00:58:40.206
No. dude. you're forcing us
to be perfect.

1450
00:58:40.342 --> 00:58:41.641
just like you always have.

1451
00:58:41.776 --> 00:58:43.240
so we can hit
the perfect family harmony.

1452
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:44.777
Yeah. for Floyd.

1453
00:58:44.912 --> 00:58:46.709
Is it. or is this all just
so you can tell people

1454
00:58:46.844 --> 00:58:48.309
- what to do again?
- Wh-What?

1455
00:58:48.444 --> 00:58:49.877
Guys. guys. this really isn't
helpful right now.

1456
00:58:50.013 --> 00:58:51.377
Let's all maybe take five. huh?

1457
00:58:51.512 --> 00:58:52.878
This isn't gonna work
if you keep on being

1458
00:58:53.014 --> 00:58:54.220
the same old John Dory.

1459
00:58:54.356 --> 00:58:55.616
Yeah. We've all changed.

1460
00:58:55.752 --> 00:58:57.019
Bruce settled down.

1461
00:58:57.154 --> 00:58:59.358
Branch is slightly taller
with zero glasses.

1462
00:58:59.493 --> 00:59:00.591
and I'm a licensed CPA.

1463
00:59:00.726 --> 00:59:02.560
Put some respect
on my name. fool!

1464
00:59:02.695 --> 00:59:04.125
Well. I'm not allowed to change.

1465
00:59:04.261 --> 00:59:06.292
I'm the oldest.
I had to be the leader.

1466
00:59:06.427 --> 00:59:08.965
You love bossing us around.
Just admit it.

1467
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.462
Why do you think I moved
to the middle of nowhere?

1468
00:59:10.597 --> 00:59:12.199
So I didn't have to be
in charge of anyone.

1469
00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:14.800
Four little brothers is
a lot of responsibility.

1470
00:59:14.936 --> 00:59:16.201
Why do you think I left?

1471
00:59:16.337 --> 00:59:18.309
So no one would treat me
like you did.

1472
00:59:18.445 --> 00:59:19.607
You know what. Spruce...

1473
00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:20.706
It's Bruce!

1474
00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:22.076
Thank you. Clay.

1475
00:59:22.212 --> 00:59:23.849
Guys. we can't forget
about Floyd.

1476
00:59:23.985 --> 00:59:25.245
Look. Branch is right--
we're here for Floyd.

1477
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.980
Let's just get this done.
and we can go

1478
00:59:27.115 --> 00:59:28.384
- our separate ways.
- Fine.

1479
00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:29.884
Wait. What?

1480
00:59:30.019 --> 00:59:31.924
What? The mission's the mission.

1481
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.788
You didn't think
we'd all live together

1482
00:59:33.923 --> 00:59:35.222
when this was all over. did you?

1483
00:59:35.357 --> 00:59:38.164
Singing songs
and roasting marshmallows?

1484
00:59:38.299 --> 00:59:39.727
Oh. I'm sorry.

1485
00:59:39.862 --> 00:59:41.295
Is that funny to you?

1486
00:59:41.431 --> 00:59:44.737
That I might want us
to actually be a family again?

1487
00:59:46.441 --> 00:59:49.236
Tiny Diamond. pull over now.

1488
00:59:53.175 --> 00:59:55.242
Don't be a baby. Branch.

1489
00:59:56.076 --> 00:59:57.409
You're mad at him.

1490
00:59:57.545 --> 00:59:59.819
but you guys do
the exact same thing to me.

1491
00:59:59.955 --> 01:00:02.182
You all still treat me
like the baby of the family.

1492
01:00:02.318 --> 01:00:04.721
but guess what.
I stopped being a baby

1493
01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:06.555
the day you guys
walked out on me.

1494
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.294
'Cause I had to.

1495
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.729
Then Grandma got eaten.

1496
01:00:09.864 --> 01:00:11.323
and there was no one else
to take care of me.

1497
01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.965
This time.
I'm walking out on you.

1498
01:00:20.401 --> 01:00:23.574
This is Branch's bunker.

1499
01:00:23.709 --> 01:00:27.879
He built this for you guys.

1500
01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:30.750
I didn't know.

1501
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:34.380
I guess you never asked.

1502
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.520
Wait.

1503
01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:39.389
Grandma got eaten?

1504
01:00:42.563 --> 01:00:44.228
Branch. wait!

1505
01:00:44.364 --> 01:00:45.429
Branch!

1506
01:00:45.565 --> 01:00:46.695
Where are you going?

1507
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:48.596
To save Floyd-- alone.

1508
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.468
I didn't need them growing up.
and I don't need them now.

1509
01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.233
What-what are you doing?

1510
01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:55.802
What do you mean?
I'm coming with you.

1511
01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:57.370
Why bother?

1512
01:00:57.506 --> 01:01:00.279
Aren't you gonna leave me
eventually anyway?

1513
01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:02.375
Everyone else does.

1514
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:08.981
I have been by your side
from the moment we met.

1515
01:01:09.117 --> 01:01:11.054
And you've been by mine.

1516
01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.790
Let's give each other
some credit here.

1517
01:01:13.925 --> 01:01:15.755
Right. Uh. I'm sorry.

1518
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.790
Thank you.

1519
01:01:16.926 --> 01:01:18.729
You're welcome.

1520
01:01:18.864 --> 01:01:20.932
And I'm not going anywhere.

1521
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.763
Unless it's with you...

1522
01:01:23.899 --> 01:01:25.633
to save Floyd.

1523
01:01:31.007 --> 01:01:32.839
Tiny! You're coming. too?

1524
01:01:32.975 --> 01:01:34.508
Hey. what can I say?

1525
01:01:34.644 --> 01:01:38.482
I was moved by Branch's speech
and his sad. sad drawing.

1526
01:01:38.617 --> 01:01:39.845
Now. let's roll!

1527
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.829
Wow. Grissy.

1528
01:01:49.964 --> 01:01:51.155
I've never seen anyone
get kicked out

1529
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.899
of a water park like that.

1530
01:01:53.034 --> 01:01:54.895
All right. for the record.
it was the waterslide

1531
01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:56.334
that ripped off my trunks.

1532
01:01:56.469 --> 01:01:58.171
Ooh. so hot.

1533
01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:00.774
Wait.

1534
01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:03.138
- Do you smell...

1535
01:02:03.273 --> 01:02:06.945
- French fries!
-  French fries.

1536
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:17.382
Ew.

1537
01:02:17.517 --> 01:02:19.390
Who goes there?

1538
01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:23.025
Putt-putt. Putt-putt. Putt-putt.

1539
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:25.123
Putt-putt.
Putt-putt. Putt-putt.

1540
01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:26.859
Are those golf balls?

1541
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:28.359
Putt-putt!

1542
01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.368
Oh. good. They're just trolls.

1543
01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:31.538
Look how cute.

1544
01:02:35.575 --> 01:02:36.770
What's happening?

1545
01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:41.443
Grissy. I didn't think

1546
01:02:41.578 --> 01:02:44.411
we'd both find ourselves
tied up on this honeymoon.

1547
01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:52.557
All right. look.

1548
01:02:52.692 --> 01:02:54.159
Security is really tight.

1549
01:02:54.294 --> 01:02:55.958
so we're not gonna be able
to just walk right in.

1550
01:02:56.094 --> 01:02:57.155
You know what that means.

1551
01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:58.356
We're scaling the walls.

1552
01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:00.461
We're. huh? Doing what? When?

1553
01:03:00.596 --> 01:03:02.198
<i>We should plan
to make our ascent</i>

1554
01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:05.102
<i>about 200 meters east
of the entrance.</i>

1555
01:03:05.237 --> 01:03:07.198
Good thing I brought
extra gummy gloves.

1556
01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:09.709
I'm tired. Carry me.

1557
01:03:09.844 --> 01:03:11.174
You have to walk
on your own. Tiny.

1558
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.445
- You have to be a big boy.
- But my feet hurt.

1559
01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.114
I don't wanna!

1560
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.678
<i>The quickest way in
will be at the roof.</i>

1561
01:03:16.813 --> 01:03:18.013
The HVAC system.

1562
01:03:18.148 --> 01:03:20.319
Ooh. I love how you say "HVAC."

1563
01:03:20.454 --> 01:03:21.614
Thank you.

1564
01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:23.319
But we'll have to
bypass the fan blade

1565
01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:26.690
so that our "cupcakes"
don't get sliced in two.

1566
01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:27.990
Ooh! We brought cupcakes?

1567
01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:29.660
- Um. no.
- No. Not what I meant.

1568
01:03:29.796 --> 01:03:31.429
It-it doesn't matter.

1569
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.404
<i>After that. we need</i>

1570
01:03:43.539 --> 01:03:45.644
<i>to cut the power
so we can move freely</i>

1571
01:03:45.779 --> 01:03:47.077
<i>through the interior air ducts.</i>

1572
01:03:47.212 --> 01:03:48.607
How do you know
which wires to cut?

1573
01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.478
I don't.
I'm just blasting everything

1574
01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:53.546
- until something turns off.

1575
01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:55.248
Hello?

1576
01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:56.614
<i>From there.</i>

1577
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.487
<i>we'll have
to do some exploring.</i>

1578
01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:00.019
<i>but we'll find Floyd
in one of those rooms.</i>

1579
01:04:00.154 --> 01:04:02.423
Look. There he is.

1580
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:08.264
Come on.

1581
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.700
Floyd.

1582
01:04:12.836 --> 01:04:14.340
Branch?

1583
01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.571
Is it really you?

1584
01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:16.739
Yeah.

1585
01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.243
It's really me.

1586
01:04:18.379 --> 01:04:19.440
Wow.

1587
01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:21.172
You've really grown
into that vest.

1588
01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:22.775
You're a man now.

1589
01:04:22.911 --> 01:04:23.978
Oh!

1590
01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:26.645
Finally. somebody gets me.

1591
01:04:29.724 --> 01:04:31.421
But you need to leave right now.

1592
01:04:31.556 --> 01:04:33.455
No. Floyd. it's okay.
We're here to rescue you.

1593
01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:35.626
No. th-this is a trap.
Velvet and Veneer. they...

1594
01:04:35.762 --> 01:04:37.062
they lured you here.

1595
01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:38.458
You got to leave
before they come back. Hurry!

1596
01:04:38.593 --> 01:04:41.027
No. I'm not leaving here
without you.

1597
01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:42.429
Branch. please.

1598
01:04:42.565 --> 01:04:43.902
- Do it for me.
We're so close.

1599
01:04:44.038 --> 01:04:45.804
I told you BroZone
would show up.

1600
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.634
My letter worked. I'm a genius.

1601
01:04:47.769 --> 01:04:50.174
Are you sure
you're sure about this?

1602
01:04:59.553 --> 01:05:01.051
Oh. no.

1603
01:05:01.187 --> 01:05:02.615
- Ow! Ow!

1604
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.689
It's biting me.
Put it in the closet!

1605
01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:06.151
Put it in the closet!

1606
01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:08.027
Hello.

1607
01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:09.893
- Floyd!
- Floyd!

1608
01:05:10.028 --> 01:05:10.959
- Hey. bro.
- Brothers.

1609
01:05:11.095 --> 01:05:12.094
It's so good to see you.

1610
01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:13.727
We would have been here sooner.

1611
01:05:13.863 --> 01:05:15.434
but these guys wouldn't stop
yelling at each other.

1612
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.562
Guys. please.

1613
01:05:16.697 --> 01:05:18.202
John Dory.
you're the one who parked

1614
01:05:18.337 --> 01:05:19.565
in the spot marked
"reserved for BroZone."

1615
01:05:19.701 --> 01:05:21.372
Didn't that seem
a little sus to you?

1616
01:05:21.507 --> 01:05:23.205
- Oh. so it's my fault?
-  Oh. look.

1617
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.239
They're even cute
when they fight.

1618
01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:26.705
- Boop. boop. boop.
- Ow! Stop!

1619
01:05:26.841 --> 01:05:28.277
- Boop. boop. boop. boop.
- What are you doing?

1620
01:05:28.413 --> 01:05:29.775
Come on. man.
You're better than this.

1621
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.210
- Well. thank you.
I really don't see

1622
01:05:31.346 --> 01:05:32.712
why you're so upset.

1623
01:05:32.847 --> 01:05:34.379
At least we're putting
your talent to good use.

1624
01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:36.116
I mean. you're welcome.

1625
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:37.751
What? You're sick.

1626
01:05:37.887 --> 01:05:40.422
You mispronounced "Thanks for
not letting our talents

1627
01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:42.591
go to waste anymore.
Velvet and Veneer."

1628
01:05:42.727 --> 01:05:45.592

on the red carpet.

1629
01:05:45.727 --> 01:05:48.134

1630
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:51.532
Oh. that's fun.
I'll grab my butt marker.

01:06:02.181 --> 01:06:04.516
Oh. it looks like
you need a hug.

Um. would it be weird
if we made out?

1638
01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:29.372
Babe. it would be weird
if we didn't.

1639

Wait!

1640
01:06:43.317 --> 01:06:44.684

1641
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.630
Is this you?

1642
01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:55.868
Hey.

1644
01:06:58.068 --> 01:06:59.971

That makes us best friends. too.

1648
01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:09.944
Yeah. she told me
about your wedding.

1649
01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:11.242
Congratulations.

1650
01:07:11.378 --> 01:07:12.814
Thanks. girl.

1651
01:07:14.318 --> 01:07:16.019
I think I made a huge mistake.

1652
01:07:16.154 --> 01:07:17.219
It's fine.

1653
01:07:17.355 --> 01:07:18.719
We're not gonna press charges.

1654
01:07:18.854 --> 01:07:20.821
I don't think
that's what she means.

1655
01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:23.492
Yeah. no. that's not
what I'm talking about.

1656
01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.930
So. you're really not
gonna eat us?

1657
01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:28.328
No. but I understand the fear.

1658
01:07:28.463 --> 01:07:31.102
If you want. I can open my mouth

1659
01:07:31.238 --> 01:07:33.499
and you can take
tiny steps toward it.

1660
01:07:33.634 --> 01:07:36.171

feel and breathe

your way through the anxiety.

1662
01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:42.878
It's called
systematic desensitization.

1663
01:07:43.013 --> 01:07:45.277
Ah... ah...

1664
01:07:45.412 --> 01:07:47.281
Or I let you go

1665
01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:50.316
and you promise not to eat us.

1666
01:07:50.452 --> 01:07:52.455
Oh. that's fine. too.

a pickup first.

1849
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:43.042

1855
01:17:58.732 --> 01:18:00.165

1856
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.426
