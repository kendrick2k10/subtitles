That's why you've been brought here.

100

So you're the reason
the clouds are so dark in my kingdom.

101
00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:30.583

-But if you fail--
-I won't fail.

110
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:51.083
I'm ready to face
whatever challenges you've set up.

111
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.500
We're all ready.

112
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.041
No. You can't join me.

113
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.375
It's too dangerous.

114
00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:58.083
Gaston must be stopped.

115
00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:02.000
If the ocean or its king needs me.
I'm there. Count me in.

Ariel. not a day goes by
where I don't miss my daddy

with every bit of my heart.

118
00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.833
If I can help you avoid that pain. I will.

119
00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:11.833
And I have an axe!

120
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.000
What do we have to do? We're ready.

Well. well. well.

124
00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.916
We meet again.

125
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.083
Oh. [chuckles]

126
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.791
Hey. Snow White.

127
00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:33.041
I'm so sorry about the Evil Queen.
the Huntsman. etcetera.

Tsk. tsk. tsk.

Behind three doors in this castle
lie three challenges.

133
00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:52.333
Bravery and resourcefulness
will be your guides.

134
00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:57.625
The path will be clear
if you search inside.

135
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.333
Let the games begin.

136
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.333
[Ariel] No!

137
00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:07.208
He can't be out of the water
for very long. He'll die!

138
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:09.291
Then I would get moving if I were you.

139
00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:10.666
Time is ticking.

140
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.916
Or dripping. in this case.

141
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.500
[chuckles] Oh. Gaston. you cad.

142
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:19.500
I almost lost you once.
I won't lose you again.

143
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.041
Okay. ladies.

144
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.333
Let's storm this castle.

[all panting]

146
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.833
There are so many doors.

147
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:36.291
Which one do we choose?

148
00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.541
Magic Mirror said the path will be clear
if you search inside.

149
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:43.416
Inside.

150
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.666
I-Inside?

151
00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.041
Ah!

152
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.375
What? [chuckles]

153
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.833
You store things in your hair?

154
00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:55.166
I always have a scootieblot on me.

155
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.916
I never know
when I'll need to dig a small hole or--

156
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.291
Or scratch my back.

157
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:01.166
-[giggles]
-Ariel. that's a key.

158
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.166
You use it to unlock doors.

159
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.500
Maybe it's a clue.

160
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958
-There.
-[all panting]

161
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.041
We should split up.

162
00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:17.208
We'll try this door.

163
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:18.666
[Snow White gasps] Oh. dear.

164
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.166
I don't think I'm going to like
where this door goes.

165
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.250
It worked. What about that door?

166
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:29.416
[doorknob rattles]

167
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.625
[sighs] No good. It's locked.

168
00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:33.541
Let me try mine!

[pan clangs]

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.750
And here I am using frying pans
for cooking.

171
00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:40.375
Why don't you go first?

172
00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:45.375
[grunts] I'm ready for you. deadly--

173
00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.416
Bedroom? With calming mood lighting?

174
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.041
Ooh.

00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:54.791
[gasps]

176
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.333
And a fruit basket.

177
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.791
-[inhales deeply. gasps]
-Don't eat that!

178
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:07.375
[chuckles] This room is beautiful.
but I don't see a challenge.

179
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:12.125
Maybe the challenge lies
not in what is here but what's not here.

180
00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:13.750
Hmm.

181
00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:17.208
Something must be missing.
but I can't put my finger on it.

182
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.208
[foot tapping]

183
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:21.208
Hmm. What about your foot?

184
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.291
Ariel. that must be it.

185
00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.750
-A mat used to be here.
-[gasps] Or a carpet.

186
00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.666
[occupant] Oh. thank goodness.

187
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.041
[chuckles]
I thought you'd never figure it out.

188
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:34.583
Is that the challenge?

189
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:36.166
It sure is!

190
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.208
And you must find the Magic Carpet.

191
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:42.000
But. ah. where is it?

192
00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:46.791
"The path will be clear
if you search inside."

193
00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:50.958
Ah! Uh. pardon me. but may we look inside?

194
00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:52.166
Of course!

195
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.333
I'm filled to the gills with good stuff.

196
00:09:55.416 --> 00:10:00.291
And there's something extra special
for you. Moana.

197
00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:01.375
[giggles]

198
00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:05.916
[Moana] Gramma Tala?

199
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.583
That's a sign if I've ever seen one.
Let's go.

200
00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:24.416
[giggling] Oh. that tickles.

201
00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.416
[gasps] Hey. watch the drawers.

202
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.166
[objects rattling]

203
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.291
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

204
00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:45.458
[contents rattle]

205
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.083
What are we looking for again?

206
00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:49.375
We're just looking-- [gasps]

207
00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.833
What is happening to your hair?

208
00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:53.208
It's incredible.

209
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:54.666
Oh. this? [chuckles]

210
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.375
This sometimes happens
because of the Sundrop Flower.

211
00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:58.458
I wonder if--

212
00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.041
Finding the Sundrop Flower
is our challenge?

213
00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:02.375
I bet it is.

214
00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:04.833
I'm not familiar with that species.

215
00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.708
Do they often grow in bedrooms?

216
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.541
-Not typically.
-[Tiana] Huh.

217
00:11:10.791 --> 00:11:13.333
Strange. These are all cookbooks.

218
00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.916
Ah. I don't believe it.

219
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.541
This is my daddy's cookbook.

220
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:20.125
W-Why is it here?

221
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:24.208
Sometimes we don't know
how things find us. They just do.

222
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.250
I think you should look inside.

223
00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:28.916
-[Tiana] Huh?
-[all gasp]

224
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.375
-[Rapunzel] Ooh.
-[Tiana gasps]

225
00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:31.458
[Snow White] Huh?

226
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:34.083
Should we knock first?

227
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:35.666
I hate to be rude.

228
00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:42.125
[door creaks]

229
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.458
[all scream]

230
00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.416
-[seagull squawks]
-[waves lapping]

231
00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:51.958
[both scream. grunt]

232
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.166
Where are we?

233
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.375
[Moana] Strange.

234
00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.083
I don't know this island.

235
00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.583
[Ariel] Ooh.

236
00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.333
Let's follow the feet holes.

237
00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:17.583
Oh. There's that shell again.

238
00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:21.208
Okay. What's this tree hiding?

239
00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.625
[grunting]

240
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.666
Oh. it's hiding absolutely nothing.

241
00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:36.000
This calls for a scootieblot moment.

242
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:42.541
-I have really got to get me one of those.
-[Ariel grunts]

243
00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.666
-[thuds]
-[gasps] There's something here.

244
00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:55.750
[gasps] Ariel. it's a treasure map.

245
00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:59.041
My navigation skills
can definitely get us there.

246
00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:00.625
Great. Let's go.

247
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:10.500
Hold on. I don't have a tail.

248
00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:11.625
Oh. Right.

249
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:12.958
[chuckles] Of course.

250
00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:17.625
[grunts]

251
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:20.416
[object whistling]

252
00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:22.875
But I can build a canoe.

253
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.583
[all scream. grunt]

254
00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.500
-Do either of you know where we are?
-[screams. shrieks]

255
00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:46.500
This place is spookier than the bayou
on a new moon night.

256
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:48.250
-[Snow White panting]
-I don't know this place.

257
00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:51.291
But. admittedly.
I haven't spent much time outside.

258
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:52.583
-[clacking]
-Snow White?

259
00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:53.666
[both gasp]

260
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:56.625
[armor beeping]

261
00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.333
You should both suit up.

262
00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:00.750
This is the Dark Forest.

263
00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:02.791
It does not mess around.

264
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:03.875
[screams. grunts]

265
00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:06.416
No!

266
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.875
My indestructible armor!

267
00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.125
So. this is the Dark Forest?

268
00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:12.833
It must be a pretty scary place.

269
00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:15.166
There are so many dangers.

270
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.375
I don't know how we'll make it through.

271
00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:18.875
We have each other.

272
00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.208
And our friend Ariel needs us now.

273
00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:23.166
We'll make it through together.

274
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.833
I'm so grateful to have you with me.

275
00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:27.583
Maybe it won't be so bad.

276
00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.125
After all. I've been here before.

277
00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:31.583
I know what to expect.

278
00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:32.750
Exactly.

279
00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.375
The bears are really quite friendly
once they've been fed.

280
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.458
Bears?

281
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.791
Did she say bears?

282
00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:41.875
And the man-eating spiders
don't actually eat you.

283
00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.000
They just nibble on your limbs a bit.

284
00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.375
It kinda tickles.

285
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:47.708
Uh. man-eating spiders?

286
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.416
Oh. I feel much better.

287
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.125
Thank you for reminding me
what's important.

288
00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:56.333
That girl is seven gems short
of a diamond mine.

289
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.750
Oh. this is just insulting.

290
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:05.666
[Gaston] But you chose five ladyfolk.

291
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.750
Surely I'm stronger and braver than them.

292
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.041
I have cheekbones like marble.

293
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:13.250
teeth like cinder blocks.

294
00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:15.541
abs you could wash laundry on.

295
00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:18.666
If I did laundry. I totally would.

296
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.250
[flies buzzing]

297
00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:22.750
Alas. Gaston.

298
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.250
Oh. what do you know?

299
00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:26.625
You may think
they're suitable matches for me.

300
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:30.041
but we'll see
if they even survive the third challenge.

301
00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:33.291
What do you mean
survive the third challenge?

302
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:36.375
The first two challenges are tests
of cunning and bravery.

303
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:38.041
Yes. yes. Go on.

304
00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:41.541
And the third challenge is.
there is no challenge.

305
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.375
It's a death trap.

306
00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:45.916
-What?
-[chuckling] Classic Gaston.

307
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.625
Then I win because they forfeit.

308
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.250
They didn't forfeit. They were tricked.

309
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:54.375
I get your big fork.
and I become ruler of land and oceans.

310
00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:57.958
with Magic Mirror here
as my loyal assistant.

311
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:01.416
I serve no one but myself.

312
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.000
-We'll talk.
-This-- This was all a setup?

313
00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:07.208
Don't be so hard on yourself.

314
00:16:07.291 --> 00:16:08.666
You're all scales and tails.

315
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.666
You couldn't have known
that I'm as calculating as I am handsome.

316
00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:15.666
-[shrieks]
-You're a scoundrel.

317
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.375
And you'll never win.

318
00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:20.083
Ariel is far more clever than you.

319
00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:21.333
They all are!

320
00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:25.208
-You think they might foil my plan?
-I know they will.

321
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:28.833
[scoffs] Then maybe we should
complicate things a little.

322
00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:31.916
[cackles]

323
00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:38.750
[gasps. groans]

324
00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.000
[groans]

325
00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:48.916
Hold on. Moana! [screaming]

326
00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:52.000
[Gaston scatting]

327
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.500
[spell zaps]

328
00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.708
A dash of thunder.

329
00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:57.333
A pinch of lightning.

330
00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:02.291
And a heaping helping
of torrential downpour!

331
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.208
[thunder rumbling]

332
00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.208
[Moana panting]

333
00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:15.083
Let's call for backup.

334
00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:17.666
Friends. help!

335
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.125
Ocean. help!

336
00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:25.375
[dolphin whistles]

337
00:17:26.791 --> 00:17:28.541
[clicks. squeaks]

338
00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:31.000
Hello. friend. You're right on time.

339
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:36.166
[cheers]

340
00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.458
[bird squawking]

341
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:45.750
What can you tell us
about the Sundrop Flower?

342
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:49.458
It grows in the most enchanted.
magical part of a forest.

343
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:51.291
and it has healing powers.

344
00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:52.958
My mother drank its nectar.

345
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:55.416
and that's why
my hair glows the way it does.

346
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.708
Ohhh! There it goes again.

347
00:17:57.791 --> 00:17:59.291
It must be close.

348
00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:00.708
-[leaves rustling]
-[gasps]

349
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.666
-[gasps]
-What's that sound?

350
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.083
Maybe it's the flower?

351
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:09.375
This is the Dark Forest.

352
00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:12.583
It could be anything. Or nothing.

353
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:16.125
That's how it gets you.

354
00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:17.666
The fear.

355
00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:27.916
-[twig snaps]
-[all scream]

356
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.375
Hello.

357
00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:32.791
You found the flower.

358
00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:35.291
[sighs] I'm sorry. little friend.

359
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:38.208
But you aren't quite

As soon as all the treasure is cleared
outta the cave. we sail.

381

Aye. aye. I'll tell the others to hurry.

Let's get to the cave.

383
00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:48.000
If treasure is in there.
maybe the carpet is too.

384
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:50.958
Or wait for the carpet to come to us.

385
00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:54.833
[gasps]
Do you think that's the Magic Carpet?

386
00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:56.791
Only one way to find out.

Are you hungry?

392
00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:16.708
-I can whip up a bit of forest gumbo.
-That wasn't me.

393
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.166
If I had to guess.
I'd say there are three…

-[wolf howls]
-…make that four. wolves.

395

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.625
I bet they put Magic Carpet in the galley
with the other treasure.

405
00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:00.916
We need a plan.

406

Why do you think
there's a dragon on the door?

631
00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:25.166
It's probably just a metaphor
for slaying our emotional dragons.

You should all get back to the ballroom.

00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:37.791

to walk away now.

We all want to help free your father
and defeat Gaston.

behind that door. we're in it together.

Well. it's worked so far. Let's go.

648
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.458
Well. this doesn't seem so bad.

At least. not if you imagine
the flames are something else altogether.

651
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.916
Like smoke from the fireplace
of a cozy cottage.

652
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.875
Yeah. I'm imagining the flames are
from the grill

653
00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:41.458
on a busy night at my restaurant.

654
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:46.875
I'm imagining the flames are a star
guiding me home after a long journey.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:49.708
This maze could be my way to freedom.

656

The unknown doesn't have to be scary.

Ow!

658
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:58.833
When I conquer this maze.
I'll see my father again.

That's the spirit.

660
00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:02.916
And I have an axe!

661
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:08.083
I've navigated through thorny situations.
but never actual thorns.

662

This all feels like the same place.

It's confusing. that's for sure.

673
00:34:36.416 --> 00:34:39.416
Look for any noticeable marks or signs
to track our way.

674
00:34:41.333 --> 00:34:43.583
Or make marks and signs.

675
00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:45.708

Where is everyone? We've lost them.

00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:26.291
Maybe they turned back.

695
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.666
Maybe they decided not to help after all?

What is making the walls change?

I ate a poisoned apple

I shouldn't have stopped to paint.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.708
[breathes deeply]

719
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:43.333
No. I'm not trapped.

720
00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:47.125
because I will
never be held captive again.

721
00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:50.000
I will always find a way out.

722
00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:52.208
And I will always find the light!

723
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:53.708

[exclaims]

725
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:02.166
[exhales]
I've never been this lost before.

726
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:04.916
Maybe I'm not as good a wayfinder
as I thought.

727
00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:08.083
Or maybe I'm not lost.

728
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.375
Maybe I just need to trust myself.

729
00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:13.125
[rumbles]

730
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:17.500

[gasps]

736
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.625
No!

737
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:34.416
I'm not gonna let
some overgrown rosebush defeat me!

[rumbles]

739
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.041
Ha! That's it!

740
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:39.625
How did you do that?

741
00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:43.458
When we doubt ourselves.
the maze shifts and changes.

742
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:46.000
-But when we crush that doubt…
-[rumbles]

743
00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:48.041
We crush the maze!

744
00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:50.041
[chuckles] Let's find the others.

745
00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:52.375
I can climb up there to spot them.

746
00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:56.875
Ow!

747
00:37:56.958 --> 00:37:59.291
Hold on. Before you climb up there--

748
00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:04.208
Some plants have saps that protect them.

749
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.666
Give me your hand.

[vines creaking]

755
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.458
Hmm. Where is she going?

[rumbling]

757
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.333
[gasps] They're ruining my maze!

758
00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:37.083
My beautiful. thorny. unbeatable maze!

759
00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:39.125
[grumbles]

760
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:46.750
I'm going to get my big. shiny for--

[panting]

762
00:38:50.166 --> 00:38:52.291
We have a king to save.

[cheers] We did it!

768
00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:27.541
We conquered the maze!

769

00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:31.500
[rock scrapes]

771
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.625
[chuckles] It's the way out.

772
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:34.833
Let's go.

-Gaston.
-[Tiana] And a dragon?

777
00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:50.541
Do you happen to speak dragon?

778
00:39:50.625 --> 00:39:51.625
Of course!

00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:55.666
-[dragon growls. roars]
-[all screaming]

780
00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:58.041
But they aren't big talkers.

781
00:39:58.125 --> 00:40:00.291
Say goodbye. princesses!

782
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:02.791
You don't stand a chance.

783
00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:05.375

-We'll never give up. Gaston.

[growls]

785
00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:10.500
Are we meant to defeat it
as the third challenge?

786
00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:11.708
I don't know.

787
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:13.625
But it wouldn't be a fair fight.

788
00:40:13.708 --> 00:40:15.750
It has a damaged wing.

789
00:40:15.833 --> 00:40:19.208
[gasps] I bet that salve I made for Ariel
can help her.

790
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:20.750
I'm going in.

791
00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:22.750
[Gaston] Food delivery. Maleficent.

792
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:26.166
One princess. piping hot.

Hmm. Aha! Hmm.

799

What are you doing. you bag of smoke?

800
00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:52.375
This dragon needs help.

801
00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:59.416
I don't care about a dragon. [grunts]

802
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.541

[screaming]

807
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.541
It's not about the stuff you have. Gaston.

808
00:41:18.625 --> 00:41:20.208
Or the power you possess.

809
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:22.208

That's hot!

812

It's about what's in your heart.

813

And the friends you make.

814
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.875
