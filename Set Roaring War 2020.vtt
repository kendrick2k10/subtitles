- I'd check a list. but.
I don't have one to check.

77
00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:13.070
- Oh. um. maybe I've got the wrong place.

78
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.808
- Oh. you can call Maisie and ask her.

79
00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:18.608
She might be a bit
difficult to get hold of.

80
00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:21.715
but her mobile's on the wall.

81
00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.382
- Okay. I'll give her a try her.

82
00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:30.602
- Oh. and can you give
her your details too.

83
00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:31.435
- Why?

84
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.466
- [Ron] Contact tracing.

85
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:35.383
- I'm fine.

86
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.763
- COVID says no.

87
00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:40.760
Sorry.

88
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.624
We've been in this routine for weeks now.

89
00:06:43.624 --> 00:06:45.624
- Look. I know. it's me.

90
00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:49.716
I think I've become a bit complacent.

91
00:06:50.873 --> 00:06:53.943
- Just give Maisie a call
and give her your details

92
00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:55.673
so you can go into the log.

93
00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:57.451
If you do it now and I come across Sarah.

94
00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:59.486
I'll let you know.

95
00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:00.660
- I've not actually met her.

96
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.314

97
00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:07.897
One of those girls. you know? (laughs)

98
00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:12.870
Look. um. this may not actually be true.

99
00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:17.511
but she may not be very well.

100
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:19.685
- (sighs) Now. I don't want to come across

101
00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.768
that I have no compassion

102
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:26.216

who this person is.

103
00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:32.011

Yean. I've really not been told much.

122
00:08:35.312 --> 00:08:39.356
- Neither have I. I only run the place.

123
00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:42.189

- [Ron] Well. now you've
eaten my favourite one.

181
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:24.350
so. just. (groans)

182
00:11:25.994 --> 00:11:28.074
- [Maddie] Why can't I
stop watching that film?

183
00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:30.384
I've seen it like a hundred times

184
00:11:30.384 --> 00:11:32.960
and I can't stop coming back to it.

185
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.660
- [Shelby] What are you talking about?

186
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.016
- I don't know what's wrong with me.

187
00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:38.483
There's just something about that film.

188
00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:40.220
- Like what exactly?

189
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.394
Come on. I've been travelling for hours.

190
00:11:42.394 --> 00:11:44.681
I'm nearly there and I
don't want to be late.

191
00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:46.220
Especially as I'm a gatecrasher.

192
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.773
- This film is telling me something.

193
00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:51.032
- What? I watched it with you.

194
00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:51.865
They go to the woods.

195
00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:54.243
The girl gets drunk. she
flashes back to who she was.

196
00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:56.499
she realises she was
born in Mediaeval times.

197
00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:57.759
End of story.

198
00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.796
- I know all that but
there's something else.

199
00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:04.789
- You drive me nuts when you
build things up like this.

200
00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:07.050
This better be worth it.

201
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.656
- I got sent a script.

202
00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:10.778
There's a prequel.

203
00:12:10.778 --> 00:12:11.611
- You're an actress.

204
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:13.052
You get sent scripts when you audition.

205
00:12:13.052 --> 00:12:14.690
I'm not an actress. I don't.

206
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.851
- It's the original script of that film.

207
00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:18.684
- [Shelby] And?

208
00:12:18.684 --> 00:12:20.009
You probably signed up to some film forum

209
00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:22.954
and it got sent out because it's cult-

210
00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:26.532
- What we watched. was a
no-budget nothing version.

211
00:12:26.532 --> 00:12:29.352
That film is getting made
properly as a trilogy

212
00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:32.077
and they want me in it-

213
00:12:32.077 --> 00:12:33.407
- Go back to sleep.

214
00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:35.235
I'm on the way to your
audition that's miles away

215
00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:37.316
that you can't be bothered
to attend. remember.

216
00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:38.808
I'm pretending to be you. right?

217
00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:40.594
- I know but this one that's come through.

218
00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.983
it could be massive.

219
00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:45.948
There's like a contract and everything.

220
00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:47.979
I've gotta discuss with my agent.

221
00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:49.229
This is so big!

222
00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:54.006
It's gonna make me once this
stupid lockdown is over.

223
00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.205
- Have you read the script?

224
00:12:55.205 --> 00:12:58.604
- I don't need to read the
script. it's paid work.

225
00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:01.430
Anyway. in the cover
letter the producer says

226
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.606
that the script in the
original film was just a decoy

227
00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:06.914
to test the idea and
get the money on board.

228
00:13:06.914 --> 00:13:09.632
This version is gonna be amazing.

229
00:13:09.632 --> 00:13:11.229
- What are you talking about?

230
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:12.062
It's so early.

231
00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:13.920
I've come so far to do this for you.

232
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.933
- Shelby. that's a paid audition

233
00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:18.378
for an advisory panel to government.

234
00:13:18.378 --> 00:13:21.191
It's the best focus group you'll ever do.

235
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:23.841
And it's the best work
out there at the moment.

236
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.691
You can thank me for the money later.

237
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:27.361
- Anyway. How can you be so excited?

238
00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:28.655
You've only been sent a script.

239
00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:32.199
- Yeah. by a courier at
7:00 a.m. this morning

240
00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:34.187
that I had to sign for.

241
00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:36.311
And then some flowers turned up.

242
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.944
It was just after you left.

243
00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:41.006
- No flowers turned up because
no one can distribute them.

244
00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:43.333
No one is doing signatures at the moment.

245
00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:46.955
- Okay. the courier knocked
and left it at the door

246
00:13:46.955 --> 00:13:48.962
but still it was FedEx

247
00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:53.305
so it was basically like my
movie experience is beginning.

248
00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:54.571
It's happening.

249
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:56.199
- It's happening again.

250
00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:59.807
- Don't Twin Peaks me. that
freaks the shit out of me.

251
00:13:59.807 --> 00:14:01.276
Anyway. look I've got to go.

252
00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:05.018
I've got to talk online with
these people for like 9:15 a.m.

253
00:14:05.018 --> 00:14:06.910
Let me know how the focus group goes.

254
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.045
It did sound interesting but
nowhere near as interesting

255
00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:13.229
as my life is gonna be
this time next year.

256
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:14.411
Don't die on me. all right.

257
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:17.337
you're supposed to be cooking dinner.

258
00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:19.686
- Right. Don't miss the interview.

259
00:14:19.686 --> 00:14:21.758
- See you when your famous.

260
00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:26.189
Don't get too bored being Maddie
Simpson government advisor.

261
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:28.189
- Just get some wine. bitch.

262
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:29.736
You're well enough to do that now. right?

263
00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:30.903
- Yeah. bitch.

264
00:14:36.808 --> 00:14:38.661
(knuckles rapping)

265
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:40.212
(door squeaking)

266
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.045
Hi there. I'm Maisie.

267
00:14:43.337 --> 00:14:45.748
You're the first here.

268
00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:47.592
Have you come far?

269
00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:49.148
- Ealing. if I was driving.

270
00:14:49.148 --> 00:14:51.340
it would just be what M25. M2

271
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.745
but I've tubed and I've trained.

272
00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:54.582
So yeah. I've been on
public transport all morning

273
00:14:54.582 --> 00:14:57.550
and it's not even nine o'clock yet. right?

274
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.759
- I'm sorry. I haven't
even asked your name.

275
00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.831
- Melody Shelby-Night.

276
00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:02.753
It's a mouthful.

277
00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:05.358
Double barreled surname.

278
00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:07.791
See. I changed names recently.

279
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:08.993
It was Maddie Simpson-Night

280
00:15:08.993 --> 00:15:11.136
but that's the name I
use as my stage name.

281
00:15:11.136 --> 00:15:13.423
Melody Shelby-Night is my real name.

282
00:15:13.423 --> 00:15:15.996
I just didn't want to use it.

283
00:15:15.996 --> 00:15:18.210
- You've come in place of your friend

284
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.811
who couldn't make it and
are winging it a little bit?

285
00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:23.673
Is that what's happening here?

286
00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.402
- Yeah. sorry.

287
00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:27.608
I didn't know what to say.

288
00:15:27.608 --> 00:15:29.334
- It's fine.

289
00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:31.107
We're glad you've turned up.

290
00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:32.097
We've had quite a few dropouts

291
00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.455
and last minute replacements so.

292
00:15:34.455 --> 00:15:37.581
Now. don't be offended. the
director might call you Maddie

293
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:41.169
as he did try and learn
everyone's names before we begin.

294
00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:42.335
Can I be frank?

295
00:15:42.335 --> 00:15:43.929
- [Shelby] Of course.

296
00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:46.883
- You're really not an actress are you?

297
00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:47.967
- You got me twice.

298
00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.134
No. I'm awful.

299
00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:52.546
Is it a problem?

300
00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:53.956
- Far from it.

301
00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:58.956
We're looking for people who
can see through the facade.

302
00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.964
- So this is more than
just a focus group then?

303
00:16:01.964 --> 00:16:03.722
- We're putting together a panel

304
00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:05.716
who will advise the government

305
00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:09.780
on how the arts community
will react to the pandemic.

306
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.482
We're on topic and we know
exactly what we're doing

307
00:16:12.482 --> 00:16:15.001
but between me and you.

308
00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:18.253
we have to put the sewage
filter on at microscopic.

309
00:16:18.253 --> 00:16:20.456
This is "Enemy of the People" stuff.

310
00:16:20.456 --> 00:16:21.404
- Ibsen. huh?

311
00:16:21.404 --> 00:16:24.215
And I'm Thomas Stockmann
with microscope on the table.

312
00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:25.513
telling everyone there's shit in the water

313
00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:27.300
and no one is listening.

314
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.550
- For a non-actress. you are on the ball.

315
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.742
- My best friend is an actress.

316
00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:35.541
I'll be honest. she's really is terrible

317
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.326
but I couldn't say that to her face.

318
00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:40.074
- [Maisie] We know Maddie.

319
00:16:40.074 --> 00:16:42.328
- Wow. she sounds important.

320
00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:46.589
- [Maisie] No. lockdown has
turned her into a prima donna.

321
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:50.917
- Thank God it wasn't just
me who picked up on that.

322
00:16:50.917 --> 00:16:54.000
(footsteps thudding)

323
00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:24.914
You know she signed up for cam work?

324
00:17:24.914 --> 00:17:26.231
- Interesting.

325
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.617
- It's ruined her.

326
00:17:27.617 --> 00:17:28.617
All we can hear from her room are

327
00:17:28.617 --> 00:17:29.940
the cash register sound effects

328
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.568
from her laptop and squealing.

329
00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:34.718
She's made an absolute
fortune these past few months

330
00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:36.433
but she's absolutely addicted.

331
00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:37.745
These guys send her gifts

332
00:17:37.745 --> 00:17:40.745
from her Amazon wish list every day.

333
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:45.454
God. I shouldn't have said any of that.

334
00:17:45.454 --> 00:17:46.621
- But you did.

335
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.465
Don't worry.

336
00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:52.908
This has been weird for everyone.

337
00:17:52.908 --> 00:17:54.433
Does she wear a mask?

338
00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:58.488
- I don't know. I have
not seen her perform.

339
00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:00.491
- I hope she's been discrete.

340
00:18:00.491 --> 00:18:02.558
The media have a way
of digging up the past

341
00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:05.058
and she was getting somewhere.

342
00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:08.707
No Disney movies for her. right?

343
00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:12.041
- She's done it for 77 days straight.

344
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:14.624
She's now got 49.000 followers.

345
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.404
I'll be honest.

346
00:18:16.404 --> 00:18:18.545
I think she's given up on
her proper acting career.

347
00:18:18.545 --> 00:18:20.371
The things she does.

348
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.312
- [Maisie] Who are we to judge
our peers in this industry?

349
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:24.796
- I couldn't do it.

350
00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:28.463
I'm not very good when
it comes to intimacy.

351
00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.062
- Why are you telling me?

352
00:18:32.062 --> 00:18:37.062
- Because. I haven't seen
anyone for about three months.

353
00:18:37.103 --> 00:18:38.313
I lost my job.

354
00:18:38.313 --> 00:18:40.259
I split-up with my boyfriend

355
00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:42.383
and you seem like a really nice person

356
00:18:42.383 --> 00:18:44.441
who I'm pretty comfortable talking with

357
00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:45.908
and these past few months I've realised

358
00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:48.839
how I feel in certain situations.

359
00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:50.969
I like scenarios like this.

360
00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:52.447
Meeting new people.

361
00:18:52.447 --> 00:18:54.780
Meeting intellectual equals.

362
00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:58.888
- I can't give you a hug. dear.

363
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.638
Two metres. all that.

364
00:19:02.435 --> 00:19:06.185
- I know. it's just.
I've come like 200 miles

365
00:19:07.077 --> 00:19:08.970
just so Maddie can save face

366
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.719
and not admit to the
normal crowd of people

367
00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:13.886
that she's probably
never going to act again.

368
00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:18.163
(sighs) I'm sorry. I'm insecure.

369
00:19:18.163 --> 00:19:19.851
I talk a lot and I latch quickly

370
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:22.500
if you show me the
slightest bit of interest.

371
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.063
- It's Monday. it's not even 9:00 a.m.

372
00:19:26.063 --> 00:19:27.653
I get you. Shelby.

373
00:19:27.653 --> 00:19:30.388
but the only reason
you're getting my time is

374
00:19:30.388 --> 00:19:32.308
because you're the first here

375
00:19:32.308 --> 00:19:33.630
and you're probably the only person

376
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.487
I'm actually going to speak to in depth

377
00:19:36.487 --> 00:19:38.945
because this morning
will run like clockwork

378
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:42.037
and my webcam goes live at midday.

379
00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:42.870
- [Shelby] You don't-

380
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.780
- [Maisie] No. I don't
but I do get booked.

381
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.280
(eerie music)

382
00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:55.012
- I'm genuinely weird.

383
00:19:56.536 --> 00:19:58.556
You're just trying to be
weird to make an impression

384
00:19:58.556 --> 00:19:59.653
and to keep up with me

385
00:19:59.653 --> 00:20:02.986
because you're swimming in the deep end.

386
00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:05.577
And I'm a shark.

387
00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:10.251
And I bite when I smell blood.

388
00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:17.577
But don't worry. I don't
want to eat you anymore.

389
00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:23.095
You're just like the rest.

390
00:20:24.393 --> 00:20:27.143
Mocking me because I'm different.

391
00:20:28.177 --> 00:20:30.927
(dramatic music)

392
00:20:43.582 --> 00:20:44.420
- Don't be alarmed.

393
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.087
I just has a sort of
moment with that girl.

394
00:20:49.345 --> 00:20:50.200
I didn't do a very good job

395
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.855
with inspiring confidence in her

396
00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:54.959
so just build her up as best you can.

397
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:57.295
- Improvise with her a bit more. maybe?

398
00:20:57.295 --> 00:21:00.628
- Yeah. play on her friend missing this.

399
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:06.840
I mean I could have just
asked her to leave but-

400
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.035
- She's done something to you?

401
00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.250
- I'm gonna be frank.

402
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.653
She's too smart for this.

403
00:21:11.653 --> 00:21:12.808
She shouldn't be here

404
00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:16.519
and I think in her Mensa IQ
way that she's just told me

405
00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:19.307
I was the best thing
that's ever happened to her

406
00:21:19.307 --> 00:21:24.298
but because I've so bluntly
rejected her I'm now her prey.

407
00:21:24.298 --> 00:21:25.972
- Why do we get weirdos?

408
00:21:25.972 --> 00:21:27.370
This was so simple.

409
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.843
- You don't know the half of this fiasco.

410
00:21:29.843 --> 00:21:31.560
This was never simple.

411
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.510
I'm just having to vent to you

412
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.008
because you needed to
know what just went on.

413
00:21:34.008 --> 00:21:36.893
I was not expecting that.

414
00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:40.776
- And now we've just
broken social distancing.

415
00:21:40.776 --> 00:21:43.927
- Get through today and
we can break it properly.

416
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.544
- (laughs) You've only just met me.

417
00:21:46.544 --> 00:21:48.867
- I haven't seen a soul for 83 days.

418
00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:50.918
You appear to have a pulse.

419
00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:54.217
And I have no standards left to adhere to.

420
00:21:54.217 --> 00:21:55.467
- What if I do?

421
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.072
- Then I'll send a message to Shelby.

422
00:21:59.072 --> 00:22:03.141
saying her attraction
should be in your direction.

423
00:22:03.141 --> 00:22:07.179
- Ah. Can I retract that last sentence?

424
00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:10.750
- Trust me. I've run group workshops

425
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.493
and corporate crap like
this for a long time.

426
00:22:13.493 --> 00:22:15.160
That girl is unique.

427
00:22:16.477 --> 00:22:18.892
Your audience awaits.

428
00:22:18.892 --> 00:22:21.892
(people chattering)

429
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:27.626
Because this morning
will run like clockwork

430
00:22:27.626 --> 00:22:30.576
and my webcam goes live at midday.

431
00:22:30.576 --> 00:22:33.015
- You don't-
- No. but I do get booked

432
00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:36.614
on TV shows and news items
to talk about the industry.

433
00:22:36.614 --> 00:22:38.792
- What. like. as an assistant?

434
00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:41.875
- Like as producer. casting director.

435
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.021
director. bitch who runs the show.

436
00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:47.022
- Sorry.

437
00:22:47.022 --> 00:22:48.930
- Don't tell me you're sorry.

438
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.355
I'm just being straight.

439
00:22:50.355 --> 00:22:53.605
You have no idea who I am or what I do.

440
00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.255
Time is money.

441
00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:58.240
This is like a workshop.

442
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.868
We're looking for
performers to participate

443
00:22:59.868 --> 00:23:02.653
on our advisory panel
and come in on our film.

444
00:23:02.653 --> 00:23:05.048
- How did you get the contract?

445
00:23:05.048 --> 00:23:06.932
- Government put it out for tender.

446
00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:09.885
we knew where to look. we applied.

447
00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:11.622
We're here.

448
00:23:11.622 --> 00:23:14.174
We're just lowest of the low spads.

449
00:23:14.174 --> 00:23:15.209
- What are spads?

450
00:23:15.209 --> 00:23:17.590
- Specialist advisors.

451
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.078
We're Dominic Cummings with permission

452
00:23:20.078 --> 00:23:20.950
to break lockdown rules

453
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.260
whilst we explore their
limits of practicality.

454
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.177
- It all sounds sneaky.

455
00:23:26.874 --> 00:23:28.498
- We just got lucky.

456
00:23:28.498 --> 00:23:31.098
For running a few focus groups

457
00:23:31.098 --> 00:23:32.955
we've got a budget to make our film.

458
00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.849
We just have to prepare a localised report

459
00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:36.260
considering where everyone involved

460
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.039
in the performing arts
might be going next.

461
00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:39.872
- Clever.

462
00:23:41.114 --> 00:23:43.703
What else do I need to know?

463
00:23:43.703 --> 00:23:46.197
Go upstairs and take a seat.

464
00:23:46.197 --> 00:23:48.514
- Maddie said it was an all-day thing.

465
00:23:48.514 --> 00:23:50.714
- Maddie didn't read.

466
00:23:50.714 --> 00:23:53.498
Nothing is printed. everything is digital.

467
00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:55.776
including signatures. and in the show

468
00:23:55.776 --> 00:23:58.801
some documents only come through on cue.

469
00:23:58.801 --> 00:24:00.912
Now. I can answer the
most pressing questions.

470
00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:03.366
Yes. this is legitimate.

471
00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:05.377
No. this isn't sneaky.

472
00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:07.960
This. as you put it. is clever.

473
00:24:09.953 --> 00:24:13.013
- Can we be friends after this?

474
00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:14.513
- [Maisie] Direct.

475
00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:17.305
What sort of friends?

476
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.086
Why?

477
00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:21.051
- I like you.

478
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:22.583
I like your attitude.

479
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:26.339
You're like a super nerd
who dresses like a bimbo.

480
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.993
I could say something crude
but I won't. (giggles)

481
00:24:28.993 --> 00:24:30.723
- [Maisie] Why not?

482
00:24:30.723 --> 00:24:33.032
- Sometimes I say things I shouldn't

483
00:24:33.032 --> 00:24:34.990
and it gets me in trouble.

484
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.706
I tell people I have Tourette syndrome

485
00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:37.663
but it's usually deliberate

486
00:24:37.663 --> 00:24:40.580
because it buzzes me when I say it.

487
00:24:42.504 --> 00:24:44.025
- Okay.

488
00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:46.630
I'm being polite because I always think

489
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.916
of this cliched old phrase.

490
00:24:48.916 --> 00:24:52.994
you attract more flies
with honey than vinegar.

491
00:24:52.994 --> 00:24:55.061
- I just think you're nice.

492
00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:56.311
- I'm not nice.

493
00:24:58.476 --> 00:24:59.825
- I'm not good with boundaries.

494
00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:00.825
- Evidently.

495
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.188
(sighs) But it sounds
as if you've been stuck

496
00:25:05.188 --> 00:25:09.071
in a flat with Rampant Maddie
for the past three months.

497
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:11.194
- Don't say it like that.

498
00:25:11.194 --> 00:25:12.464
- Why not?

499
00:25:12.464 --> 00:25:15.047
- You make it sound submissive.

500
00:25:16.688 --> 00:25:18.067
Like I'm a little girl.

501
00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:21.939
- I deal with people all the time. Shelby.

502
00:25:21.939 --> 00:25:22.939
I'm a bitch.

503
00:25:24.087 --> 00:25:27.422
You're exactly what I say you are.

504
00:25:27.422 --> 00:25:31.832
And if you don't like that.
we can't be friends. Ever.

505
00:25:31.832 --> 00:25:33.369
You're a nice girl. Shelby.

506
00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:35.131
but you really need to get out more.

507
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:36.499
- Like I've been able to go anywhere

508
00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:38.094
in the past three months.

509
00:25:38.094 --> 00:25:39.095
- My bad.

510
00:25:39.095 --> 00:25:41.711
Lockdown hasn't really
been a thing for me.

511
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:44.838
Look it up. people likely
to break lockdown rules.

512
00:25:44.838 --> 00:25:46.718
those with psychopathic traits.

513
00:25:46.718 --> 00:25:48.935
- [Shelby] Do you have
psychopathic traits?

514
00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:50.386
- Depends.

515
00:25:50.386 --> 00:25:51.719
Sadistic. maybe?

516
00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:55.533
You see. I'm in the Dark Triad.

517
00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:58.863
- You're pretty clever aren't you?

518
00:25:58.863 --> 00:26:02.897
- I'm not clever. I just try and be smart.

519
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:07.357
- Narcissism.
Machiavellianism. psychopathy.

520
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:09.774
That's the Dark Triad. right.

521
00:26:11.514 --> 00:26:13.849
- Not bad for a Monday morning.

522
00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:17.130
- I just read the same
article on the train.

523
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.184
- So. you don't know anything
else about the Dark Triad?

524
00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:22.521
- I did a Psychology degree.

525
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:25.976
I want to have faith
in humanity. humanism.

526
00:26:25.976 --> 00:26:28.559
I want to align with Kantianism

527
00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:33.562
but I'm just not a light triad kinda girl.

528
00:26:33.562 --> 00:26:35.088
- Clearly not.

529
00:26:35.088 --> 00:26:37.791
- You can call me Melody if you want to?

530
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:39.470
I can be more submissive

531
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.856
if that makes it easier for you

532
00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:43.356
to feel more dominant over me.

533
00:26:44.495 --> 00:26:46.777
- Why don't you like being called Melody?

534
00:26:46.777 --> 00:26:48.110
- I'm tone deaf.

535
00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:51.086
- Genuinely?

536
00:26:51.086 --> 00:26:53.253
- Yeah. congenital amusia.

537
00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:57.395
It was all confirmed when I was little.

538
00:26:57.395 --> 00:27:00.400
My parents are both music teachers.

539
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.233
- Ironic.

540
00:27:02.342 --> 00:27:04.569
- [Shelby] Story of my life.

541
00:27:04.569 --> 00:27:07.319
I've disappointed lots of people.

542
00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:11.556
- What's been your biggest
disappointment in life?

543
00:27:11.556 --> 00:27:13.916
- Opening that door.

544
00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:15.850
- Why is that disappointing?

545
00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.355
- Because nothing else will
match this moment for months.

546
00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:24.272
- Sarcastic banter from
a cynical cow like me.

547
00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:26.434
Is that what you like?

548
00:27:26.434 --> 00:27:27.267
- No.

549
00:27:28.402 --> 00:27:30.594
I like simple things.

550
00:27:30.594 --> 00:27:33.094
I can cope with simple things.

551
00:27:34.033 --> 00:27:35.950
This seems complicated.

552
00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:42.473
You're out of your depth

553
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:45.755
but it could be that
your whole company is out

554
00:27:45.755 --> 00:27:47.838
of it's respective depth.

555
00:27:49.928 --> 00:27:51.678
- Yeah. maybe we are.

556
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:57.316
- No. there's more to it than that.

557
00:28:00.004 --> 00:28:00.921
- Is there?

558
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.545
(very quiet gentle music)

559
00:28:07.545 --> 00:28:10.295
(camera beeping)

560
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:41.451
(dramatic music)

561
00:28:42.563 --> 00:28:45.146
(upbeat music)

562
00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:08.409
(footsteps tapping)

563
00:29:14.568 --> 00:29:17.151
(toy whirring)

564
00:29:29.778 --> 00:29:33.028
(quiet dramatic music)

565
00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:12.062
- Okay. good morning. everyone!

566
00:30:12.062 --> 00:30:15.327
Tell you what. just gonna
take us out of here like so.

567
00:30:15.327 --> 00:30:18.410
Okay. well. thank you all for coming.

568
00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:21.878
None of you know who I am.

569
00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:24.613
Which is why you've been paid

570
00:30:24.613 --> 00:30:27.530
to participate in this masterclass?

571
00:30:29.587 --> 00:30:31.287
Here is how this works.

572
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:33.787
We have been contracted by the government

573
00:30:33.787 --> 00:30:36.856
to prepare a localised report on the state

574
00:30:36.856 --> 00:30:38.525
of the Performing Arts industry

575
00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:42.219
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

576
00:30:42.219 --> 00:30:45.052
Ultimately. we need your feedback.

577
00:30:46.802 --> 00:30:49.960
That is why we are in a theatre.

578
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.877
We are in the lifeblood

579
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.763
of where the economy of
production will restart.

580
00:30:56.763 --> 00:31:00.263
Now. is that pretentious enough. I wonder?

581
00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:04.048
What we're also doing.

582
00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:07.486
is using the money we've
been paid to make a film.

583
00:31:07.486 --> 00:31:09.403
You are focus group one

584
00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:13.351
and you don't have to do
much other than to watch

585
00:31:13.351 --> 00:31:16.768
and answer some questions when I ask you.

586
00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:22.292
Now. before we get in flow of
things. these are the rules.

587
00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:23.792
Do not break them.

588
00:31:26.438 --> 00:31:29.731
We are under lockdown
conditions across the country.

589
00:31:29.731 --> 00:31:31.148
We are on day 78.

590
00:31:31.998 --> 00:31:35.032
We've been. how should I put this?

591
00:31:35.032 --> 00:31:37.413
Very naughty as a production outfit

592
00:31:37.413 --> 00:31:38.246
and have got you all here

593
00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:41.579
in a very clever and very legal fashion.

594
00:31:43.366 --> 00:31:46.490
One. I hope none of you have coronavirus.

595
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.360
If you do. then there's
no point in getting out.

596
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.046
you've already infected the room.

597
00:31:52.046 --> 00:31:54.629
Two. respect social distancing.

598
00:31:56.167 --> 00:31:57.936
Three. if you haven't got the credentials

599
00:31:57.936 --> 00:32:00.740
we asked for you don't get paid.

600
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.907
Four. today you're working

601
00:32:04.713 --> 00:32:07.713
as contributors to an advisory panel

602
00:32:09.534 --> 00:32:13.300
on how we. acting as
agents for government.

603
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.741
should move forward after
the pandemic has peaked.

604
00:32:17.741 --> 00:32:22.288
And by we meaning the performing
arts industry at large.

605
00:32:22.288 --> 00:32:25.538
And five. this is a relaxed atmosphere.

606
00:32:28.754 --> 00:32:31.254
I want us to keep it that way.

607
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:33.638
Any questions?

608
00:32:35.568 --> 00:32:37.716
- How much are we getting paid again?

609
00:32:37.716 --> 00:32:39.006
- Whatever it said on the advert.

610
00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.117
- It didn't.

611
00:32:40.117 --> 00:32:40.950
- It did.

612
00:32:41.972 --> 00:32:42.954
- I didn't see it.

613
00:32:42.954 --> 00:32:44.540
- It's a Spotlight advert.

614
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.068
It costs money to place those.

615
00:32:47.068 --> 00:32:49.222
We saw all the actors
moaning and complaining

616
00:32:49.222 --> 00:32:51.243
about how Spotlight wasn't helping them.

617
00:32:51.243 --> 00:32:54.327
but why. if we weren't
serious. would we use Spotlight

618
00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:57.740
and advertise a fee
alongside strict conditions.

619
00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.954
- My agent told me to show up.

620
00:32:59.954 --> 00:33:02.794
I genuinely didn't see the advert.

621
00:33:02.794 --> 00:33:04.502
- If your agent told you
to walk off a bridge.

622
00:33:04.502 --> 00:33:06.098
would you do it?

623
00:33:06.098 --> 00:33:09.018
- It depends if that was
in the casting brief.

624
00:33:09.018 --> 00:33:11.518
- Are you always this logical?

625
00:33:13.244 --> 00:33:15.540
- I do what I'm told.

626
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.663
And yeah. I'm not good at
reading between the lines

627
00:33:19.663 --> 00:33:22.330
so I just react in a direct way.

628
00:33:24.098 --> 00:33:28.016
- Because you're a little bit autistic?

629
00:33:28.016 --> 00:33:30.601
- No. I just lack confidence.

630
00:33:30.601 --> 00:33:34.739
So I make mistakes and ask dumb questions

631
00:33:34.739 --> 00:33:37.088
then beat myself for the rest of the day.

632
00:33:37.088 --> 00:33:42.088
- Ah. okay. a nicely
introverted. extrovert. (laughs)

633
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.061
- I was in a few films when I was younger

634
00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:50.728
but then I lost body confidence.

635
00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:55.878
- Okay. well. step up. we need to move on.

636
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.333
- This of this as reality TV

637
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:05.135
which you're part of from the get go.

638
00:34:05.135 --> 00:34:06.844
- What's part two?

639
00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:09.045
- Listen and learn.

640
00:34:09.045 --> 00:34:13.129
Today. I also want to give
you something a little extra.

641
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:15.187
I want to talk to you
about my new production.

642
00:34:15.187 --> 00:34:17.677
It's called "The Mist."

643
00:34:17.677 --> 00:34:20.434
It's about betrayal and treachery

644
00:34:20.434 --> 00:34:22.851
within government and law enforcement.

645
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:26.164
But that isn't good entertainment
for 60 million people

646
00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:28.381
in a heatwave who just want
to get out of the house.

647
00:34:28.381 --> 00:34:30.714
No. we need escapist fantasy

648
00:34:33.682 --> 00:34:37.099
but that is un-produceable without money.

649
00:34:38.818 --> 00:34:42.553
"The Mist" is about all
the people who I know

650
00:34:42.553 --> 00:34:45.241
who've worked against me

651
00:34:45.241 --> 00:34:48.408
and who tried to sabotage my progress.

652
00:34:49.444 --> 00:34:51.460
It's allegorical.

653
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.700
It's metaphorical.

654
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.033
It's a parallel.

655
00:34:56.367 --> 00:34:58.463
Run with this and you will be rewarded.

656
00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.602
Mock it and you will be
immortalised for doing so.

657
00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:03.818
Our relationships live and die

658
00:35:03.818 --> 00:35:07.242
in this next two hour time frame.

659
00:35:07.242 --> 00:35:11.242
The clock's ticking.
folks. so be on your guard.

660
00:35:14.364 --> 00:35:15.197
Scared?

661
00:35:17.033 --> 00:35:17.866
Excited?

662
00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:27.096
You've all been betrayed
before. I presume?

663
00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:30.471
Come on. wakey. wakey. hands up.

664
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:31.411
Who's been betrayed before

665
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:34.244
by someone they loved and trusted?

666
00:35:39.058 --> 00:35:40.891
You. what's your name?

667
00:35:42.148 --> 00:35:43.490
- Melody.

668
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.907
- Beautiful name.

669
00:35:46.198 --> 00:35:48.049
How did you get here. Melody?

670
00:35:48.049 --> 00:35:50.378
I'm casting "The Mist" right now

671
00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:52.414
and I'm gonna give you a part

672
00:35:52.414 --> 00:35:54.608
but the answer you give.

673
00:35:54.608 --> 00:35:56.618
dictates the part you're going to get.

674
00:35:56.618 --> 00:35:58.118
- I got the train.

675
00:35:59.029 --> 00:36:00.763
- From where?

676
00:36:00.763 --> 00:36:03.858
- London. Ealing. so tube then train.

677
00:36:03.858 --> 00:36:06.060
I had to get up early to make it.

678
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.219
- Did I ask for detail?

679
00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:09.423
- No.

680
00:36:09.423 --> 00:36:11.336
- Then why did you give me detail?

681
00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:13.463
- I thought that's what you wanted.

682
00:36:13.463 --> 00:36:14.596
- What is this?

683
00:36:14.596 --> 00:36:16.212
- An acting class.

684
00:36:16.212 --> 00:36:18.545
A government advisory panel?

685
00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:20.776
- Better.

686
00:36:20.776 --> 00:36:21.952
- Thank you.

687
00:36:21.952 --> 00:36:23.139
- You're here to work.

688
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:25.055
Don't thank me.

689
00:36:25.055 --> 00:36:28.170
So. Melody. why did you give me detail?

690
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.986
- I was trying to indicate
the effort I made to get here.

691
00:36:30.986 --> 00:36:31.819
- Okay.

692
00:36:32.887 --> 00:36:37.405
When I ask a question I'm
looking for direct answers.

693
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:38.803
Yeah?

694
00:36:38.803 --> 00:36:42.684
If I want detail I'll
ask you to elaborate.

695
00:36:42.684 --> 00:36:43.601
Understand?

696
00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:48.021
Now. Melody. what was
the last role you played.

697
00:36:48.021 --> 00:36:48.854
- I was the narrator

698
00:36:48.854 --> 00:36:52.139
in the Christmas play in primary school.

699
00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:55.972
- Ah. thrown yourself
in at the deep end here.

700
00:36:58.185 --> 00:37:00.935
(Michael laughs)

701
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:04.398
- I'm here in place of a friend.

702
00:37:04.398 --> 00:37:07.213
She had a big audition come
up and couldn't make it.

703
00:37:07.213 --> 00:37:09.834
She didn't want to see the
train ticket to go to waste.

704
00:37:09.834 --> 00:37:10.999
- What was the audition?

705
00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:11.865
- Film.

706
00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:13.698
- Film. How much for?

707
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:16.088
I'm sure she would've talked about it.

708
00:37:16.088 --> 00:37:17.243
- I don't know how much.

709
00:37:17.243 --> 00:37:19.447
- And she chose that over today

710
00:37:19.447 --> 00:37:22.105
even though she was gonna get paid?

711
00:37:22.105 --> 00:37:24.479
Now Melody. the role I'm giving you

712
00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:28.107
in "The Mist." it pays 3.350 pounds.

713
00:37:28.107 --> 00:37:31.204
It's a flat rate for a few weeks filming.

714
00:37:31.204 --> 00:37:32.600
Do you want the job?

715
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.654
- I've not acted since primary school.

716
00:37:34.654 --> 00:37:37.068
- You made the effort
to take public transport

717
00:37:37.068 --> 00:37:38.856
to get across London to
get to the back of beyond

718
00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:41.353
for 9:00 a.m. during lockdown.

719
00:37:41.353 --> 00:37:43.020
You made the effort.

720
00:37:44.705 --> 00:37:46.700
Do you want the job?

721
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.200
- Yeah. all right.

722
00:37:49.525 --> 00:37:51.775
- What did your friend say?

723
00:37:53.022 --> 00:37:55.022
- There's been a mix up.

724
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.557
They'd already cast the role

725
00:37:59.557 --> 00:38:02.302
and then they didn't need
to see anymore clients.

726
00:38:02.302 --> 00:38:06.385
- Right. first rule of
"The Mist." believe in it.

727
00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:10.859
Your friend turned us down

728
00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:13.269
for a video conference
audition that got cancelled.

729
00:38:13.269 --> 00:38:15.119
yet you've just landed
yourself a bigger role

730
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.462
than she's ever had

731
00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:19.841
and you've not acted since primary school.

732
00:38:19.841 --> 00:38:22.399
- Believe it when I see it.

733
00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:27.232
- Go and see Maisie next door.
she'll give you an advance.

734
00:38:31.888 --> 00:38:33.912
- I don't want to miss what you do next.

735
00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:36.082
- Ah. so you trust me?

736
00:38:36.082 --> 00:38:36.915
- Yeah.

737
00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:42.792
- Good. All right. so. what's
the first rule of "The Mist."

738
00:38:43.448 --> 00:38:45.213
- Believe in it?

739
00:38:45.213 --> 00:38:47.375
- Everybody. come on. what's
the first rule of "The Mist?"

740
00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:48.473
- [All] Believe in it.

741
00:38:48.473 --> 00:38:50.586
- Right. thank you.

742
00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:54.336
So. do you see. you're
all here for a reason.

743
00:38:57.096 --> 00:38:58.429
You're all cast.

744
00:38:59.618 --> 00:39:01.761
Who's up for it?

745
00:39:01.761 --> 00:39:03.898
- How do we know it's real?

746
00:39:03.898 --> 00:39:05.162
- Ask Maisie or check your phones.

747
00:39:05.162 --> 00:39:09.515
It's what you do during these
workshops anyway. isn't it?

748
00:39:09.515 --> 00:39:13.263
All of your agents have contacted you.

749
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.962
- Have you got free Wi-Fi?

750
00:39:14.962 --> 00:39:18.545
- Do I look like the
fucking IT department?

751
00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:24.388
Yes. look for the cloud and
use the mist. all lowercase.

752
00:39:24.388 --> 00:39:26.088
If you look to the walls

753
00:39:26.088 --> 00:39:28.700
you'll find the Wi-Fi
password on the posters.

754
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.119
It is traitor. T-R-A-I-T-O-R.

755
00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.939
- What time does this finish?

756
00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:37.780
- Why are you asking me that question?

757
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.602
- It's a long day. man.

758
00:39:39.602 --> 00:39:41.060
I'm supposed to be shooting a short film

759
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.383
about lockdown in our house this evening

760
00:39:44.383 --> 00:39:47.246
and I need to leave by 4:00 p.m.

761
00:39:47.246 --> 00:39:50.913
so I might have to skip
on the last section.

762
00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:53.552
- Hey. look. fine by me.

763
00:39:53.552 --> 00:39:55.787
It's your career.

764
00:39:55.787 --> 00:39:56.870
- Thanks man.

765
00:39:57.807 --> 00:39:59.248
- Are you hungover?

766
00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:00.081
- No.

767
00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:01.023
- Stoned?

768
00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:02.103
- I don't get it.

769
00:40:02.103 --> 00:40:03.903
- Do you follow instructions?

770
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:04.772
- Yeah.

771
00:40:04.772 --> 00:40:05.780
- Then why don't I care

772
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.680
if you've got to leave at four o'clock?

773
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.071
- Is this an exercise?

774
00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:11.490
- Yeah. it's called
was I paying attention?

775
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.323
- Was I?

776
00:40:12.323 --> 00:40:15.546
- No. Work it out four o'clock.

777
00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:19.463
I'm gonna move on now.
if that's okay with you.

778
00:40:20.503 --> 00:40:24.758
Right. so. now I need
to tell you all about me

779
00:40:24.758 --> 00:40:28.465
before I can bring you up
to speed with "The Mist."

780
00:40:28.465 --> 00:40:30.798
So do I have any volunteers?

781
00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.943
Who wants to be me?

782
00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:37.305
- I'll do it.

783
00:40:37.305 --> 00:40:39.222
- Melody. are you sure?

784
00:40:40.296 --> 00:40:44.084
You haven't acted since primary school.

785
00:40:44.084 --> 00:40:46.242
All right. I'll give you a shot.

786
00:40:46.242 --> 00:40:47.529
Sight read this.

787
00:40:47.529 --> 00:40:50.542
Check your phone for the pdf.

788
00:40:50.542 --> 00:40:53.801
- I've been misunderstood
for as long as I can remember

789
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:55.770
but as I can brutally attest.

790
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.206
the ethos I've worked to
hasn't reaped any benefits.

791
00:40:59.206 --> 00:41:01.489
As I will detail. I've
helped countless people

792
00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:04.870
over the years but I've
never had this faith repaid.

793
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.169
In my entire career.

794
00:41:06.169 --> 00:41:07.227
I've never ever had

795
00:41:07.227 --> 00:41:09.998
a reciprocated opportunity afforded me.

796
00:41:09.998 --> 00:41:14.301
I honestly have no idea how
I've kept producing but I have.

797
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:16.005
I've literally done everything on nothing

798
00:41:16.005 --> 00:41:19.633
and this includes a crippling
lack of emotional support.

799
00:41:19.633 --> 00:41:22.231
In this life. if I do
get somewhere in film

800
00:41:22.231 --> 00:41:25.314
no one will be more shocked than me.

801
00:41:25.314 --> 00:41:26.814
- Wow. is that me?

802
00:41:29.649 --> 00:41:32.856
Yeah. of course it's me but
that information is generic.

803
00:41:32.856 --> 00:41:35.203
It could be a lot of people.

804
00:41:35.203 --> 00:41:36.841
Don't ruin it.

805
00:41:36.841 --> 00:41:40.341
This is an Oscar clip and that's personal.

806
00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:44.728
- I believe firmly in reincarnation.

807
00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:47.691
I'm not a Buddhist nor do I practise any

808
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:50.208
of the world's religions
but I'm pretty confident

809
00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:52.447
I've been in this world before.

810
00:41:52.447 --> 00:41:54.041
I was gone before the Second World War

811
00:41:54.041 --> 00:41:55.628
but definitely lived through the evolution

812
00:41:55.628 --> 00:42:00.433
of the movie business in North
America and had influence.

813
00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:02.183
I'm pretty sure I was born close

814
00:42:02.183 --> 00:42:05.104
to the sea near Malibu. California.

815
00:42:05.104 --> 00:42:07.494
Presently. I've never
felt at home in England

816
00:42:07.494 --> 00:42:10.896
and I've been a fish out
of water my whole life.

817
00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.125
- [Director] Not bored

818
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:14.998
but let's give the rest
of the group a chance.

819
00:42:14.998 --> 00:42:15.831
Next.

820
00:42:18.464 --> 00:42:20.257
- Where's the speech?

821
00:42:20.257 --> 00:42:22.424
- Delivered to your phone.

822
00:42:23.381 --> 00:42:27.116
- Oh. those are the emails
that have been coming through.

823
00:42:27.116 --> 00:42:29.116
I've been deleting them.

824
00:42:30.168 --> 00:42:34.279
- (scoffs) Someone else.

825
00:42:34.279 --> 00:42:37.196
- I can't sight read from my phone.

826
00:42:38.878 --> 00:42:41.629
- I think that girl is
asleep already. fantastic.

827
00:42:41.629 --> 00:42:44.602
Melody. I shouldn't have
questioned your ability.

828
00:42:44.602 --> 00:42:46.519
You're my go to reader.

829
00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:50.775
You know. when we organised this

830
00:42:50.775 --> 00:42:53.805
we thought this was gonna be simple.

831
00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:55.555
Take it away. Melody.

832
00:42:57.315 --> 00:42:59.006
- I can give you the finished article

833
00:42:59.006 --> 00:43:01.068
but I can't show you my working.

834
00:43:01.068 --> 00:43:02.800
It's caused incredible frustration

835
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.451
because there has been so much I've wanted

836
00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:06.830
to articulate or create that I can't

837
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.411
because my body doesn't perform
what my brain understands.

838
00:43:11.411 --> 00:43:15.079
I get crippled with what
I call logic blocks.

839
00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:18.021
This isn't writer's block. or OCD.

840
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:21.472
it is the complete inability
to get past a simple obstacle.

841
00:43:21.472 --> 00:43:24.088
like a computer stuck
constantly restarting.

842
00:43:24.088 --> 00:43:27.806
leading to an entirely
black thought process.

843
00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:30.806
(quiet eerie music)

844
00:43:32.229 --> 00:43:35.410
If you've ever felt what I'm
describing you might relate

845
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:37.780
but two other odd things have stuck out

846
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.549
and presented themselves to me.

847
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:43.110
Jean Harlow has been
something of a fascination

848
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:47.268
but I'm also sure I had
ties to a French doctor.

849
00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:49.435
Marie Curie. for a period.

850
00:43:51.761 --> 00:43:53.978
I've crossed paths with her in this life

851
00:43:53.978 --> 00:43:55.895
but it didn't end well.

852
00:44:00.994 --> 00:44:03.124
- What's your full name. Melody?

853
00:44:03.124 --> 00:44:04.957
- Melody Shelby-Night.

854
00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:07.353
- Well read.

855
00:44:08.462 --> 00:44:11.094
In "The Mist". you can be me.

856
00:44:11.094 --> 00:44:13.069
- Is this story true?

857
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:15.630
- Did everyone get the story?

858
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.899
I think I've been here before.

859
00:44:18.899 --> 00:44:20.007
- What do you mean?

860
00:44:20.007 --> 00:44:22.840
For real? Like. can you elaborate?

861
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.097
- I believe in reincarnation.

862
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.520
In another life I was born
near Malibu in America in 1900

863
00:44:33.097 --> 00:44:36.280
but Malibu back then
wasn't the place it is now.

864
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.697
It was like a private estate.

865
00:44:40.863 --> 00:44:43.646
my mother was a Mexican peasant

866
00:44:43.646 --> 00:44:46.227
and she was a master of pottery.

867
00:44:46.227 --> 00:44:49.560
I was three and I had a little blue suit

868
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.161
and I remember looking out to sea

869
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:57.325
and watching as the waves
crashed in and my feet got wet.

870
00:44:57.325 --> 00:45:00.242
- What's the bit about Marie Curie?

871
00:45:01.718 --> 00:45:03.470
- It's hazy.

872
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.252
I had a relationship with a French doctor

873
00:45:05.252 --> 00:45:06.285
who was older than me.

874
00:45:06.285 --> 00:45:08.552
And in a regression my mind told me

875
00:45:08.552 --> 00:45:11.969
it was Marie Curie or one of her sisters.

876
00:45:15.896 --> 00:45:19.479
I'm telling you I
believe in reincarnation.

877
00:45:24.554 --> 00:45:27.054
(eerie music)

878
00:45:29.252 --> 00:45:32.335
(ghostly whispering)

879
00:46:03.106 --> 00:46:04.773
- Are you all right?

880
00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:09.328
What you're talking
about is a bit surreal.

881
00:46:11.438 --> 00:46:13.307
- It is surreal.

882
00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:15.266
And it's my life.

883
00:46:15.266 --> 00:46:16.894
(ghostly whispering)

884
00:46:16.894 --> 00:46:17.727
- Okay.

885
00:46:18.896 --> 00:46:22.739
- Look. would you all
just follow the game here?

886
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:25.072
It's from the script. yeah?.

887
00:46:26.082 --> 00:46:29.115
- So. you're not really reincarnated?

888
00:46:29.115 --> 00:46:31.615
(eerie music)

889
00:46:33.926 --> 00:46:35.926
- I've been here before.

890
00:46:39.927 --> 00:46:41.010
I'm tuned in.

891
00:46:43.912 --> 00:46:47.079
And you're all buried from the get-go.

892
00:46:48.135 --> 00:46:49.052
Who you are

893
00:46:54.184 --> 00:46:55.924
who each and everyone of you are.

894
00:46:55.924 --> 00:46:58.916
is about 20 layers beneath
the personality you present

895
00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.433
to the rest of the world.

896
00:47:00.433 --> 00:47:02.654
- Have you got proof
of your reincarnation?

897
00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:04.076
- My old friend behind me is standing

898
00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:06.020
at the back of the stage.

899
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.366
(eerie music)

900
00:47:08.366 --> 00:47:11.533
(footsteps shuffling)

901
00:47:23.137 --> 00:47:26.503
(toy whirring)

902
00:47:26.503 --> 00:47:28.618
She didn't much like the Marie Curie girl

903
00:47:28.618 --> 00:47:31.282
and that's why she jumped in on her.

904
00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:34.282
- What do you mean jumped in on her?

905
00:47:35.314 --> 00:47:37.897
(toy whirring)

906
00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:57.052
- Radio controlled. Maisie's idea.

907
00:47:59.118 --> 00:48:02.572
Do you know what happens
with naive people?

908
00:48:02.572 --> 00:48:07.142
They have a glow. an
aura that surrounds them.

909
00:48:07.142 --> 00:48:10.185
They're just innocent because
they haven't quite worked out

910
00:48:10.185 --> 00:48:13.392
how hard this world is to navigate.

911
00:48:13.392 --> 00:48:16.182
And everyone on the other side.

912
00:48:16.182 --> 00:48:18.142
and this means you have to believe

913
00:48:18.142 --> 00:48:21.642
in some kind of the other side. sees this.

914
00:48:22.827 --> 00:48:24.759
They know they can jump in

915
00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:28.509
and conduct through
these people. so they do.

916
00:48:30.676 --> 00:48:34.180
It doesn't happen for
long. but it's long enough

917
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:38.286
and then these innocents.
when they change.

918
00:48:38.286 --> 00:48:42.036
and it happens instantly.
they lose the glow.

919
00:48:43.346 --> 00:48:47.679
They stop conducting and
free fall out of your life.

920
00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:52.622
- Wait. that is real for you. isn't it?

921
00:48:52.622 --> 00:48:55.102
- This is "The Mist" I'm talking about.

922
00:48:55.102 --> 00:48:57.049
And it's why I want to
make a film about it.

923
00:48:57.049 --> 00:49:00.966
You see in here. you're
in my place of worship.

924
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.447
You're in my church.

925
00:49:06.537 --> 00:49:08.925
And this is where all my ghosts live.

926
00:49:08.925 --> 00:49:11.592
- People don't get you. do they?

927
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:14.124
- Ah no. they get me.

928
00:49:14.124 --> 00:49:16.892
they just get out of
their depth real quick.

929
00:49:16.892 --> 00:49:18.975
- What about Marie Curie?

930
00:49:20.768 --> 00:49:22.314
Who was she to you?

931
00:49:22.314 --> 00:49:24.942
- She come to me again in a dream

932
00:49:24.942 --> 00:49:28.580
and I've lost contact with her since.

933
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.341
So. really. she's just another ghost.

934
00:49:31.341 --> 00:49:33.761
- And a character in "The Mist"?

935
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.723
- Yeah. maybe.

936
00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:39.806
- What are we really supposed
to learn from this workshop?

937
00:49:39.806 --> 00:49:41.749
This is a bit weird.

938
00:49:41.749 --> 00:49:43.208
- Trust me. folks. you're not
going to like me for this.

939
00:49:43.208 --> 00:49:45.753
But I'm gonna make you famous.

940
00:49:45.753 --> 00:49:47.613
- How are you going to do that?

941
00:49:47.613 --> 00:49:51.619
- By killing one of you
to wrap up the event.

942
00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:52.452
I digress.

943
00:49:55.528 --> 00:49:57.975
Whose learnt something today?

944
00:49:57.975 --> 00:50:02.835
- This whole thing is about
creating make-believe. right?

945
00:50:02.835 --> 00:50:04.772
- Go on. I'm hearing intelligent thought.

946
00:50:04.772 --> 00:50:06.607
- It's about seeing if
we can be naive enough

947
00:50:06.607 --> 00:50:08.818
to be children again.

948
00:50:08.818 --> 00:50:11.334
- And we're all going to paint rainbows.

949
00:50:11.334 --> 00:50:13.966
(scoffs) You're astute.

950
00:50:13.966 --> 00:50:18.671
But what if this experience
isn't about being naive?

951
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:21.564
- Then you've kind of conned us

952
00:50:21.564 --> 00:50:23.981
into a group therapy session?

953
00:50:25.274 --> 00:50:27.512
- Another good stance
but we've paid you all

954
00:50:27.512 --> 00:50:29.848
to be here. remember?

955
00:50:29.848 --> 00:50:32.317
This is a job and I haven't even begun

956
00:50:32.317 --> 00:50:34.881
to explain what your responsibilities are

957
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:37.297
and most of you have forgotten
that that is why you're here.

958
00:50:37.297 --> 00:50:39.450
- What are the responsibilities then?

959
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.761
- [Director] Dig deep.

960
00:50:41.761 --> 00:50:44.521
Ask questions of yourself.

961
00:50:44.521 --> 00:50:45.938
Why are you here?

962
00:50:47.539 --> 00:50:51.548
- Is that some ancient
Greek tragedy method shit?

963
00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:53.083
(all laughing)

964
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:56.056
- Fatal flaw. hamartia. all that?

965
00:50:56.056 --> 00:50:59.936
- Foreign language man.
I'm Meisner trained.

966
00:50:59.936 --> 00:51:02.121
- So you can recite 80
pages of your script

967
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:04.558
to the fucking wall with
the same dull inflexion?

968
00:51:04.558 --> 00:51:05.391
Fantastic.

969
00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:08.911
Remind me not to give you a big role.

970
00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:12.092
'cause you're wooden as fuck.

971
00:51:12.092 --> 00:51:13.556
- I'm not wooden.

972
00:51:13.556 --> 00:51:15.449
You should see my reviews.

973
00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:17.016
- Oh. I did.

974
00:51:17.016 --> 00:51:19.334
Why did I choose you?

975
00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:21.657
23 productions since graduating.

976
00:51:21.657 --> 00:51:23.909
Consistently praised for his.

977
00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:25.715
"articulation and diction.

978
00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:28.035
"this person is truly
a performer to watch."

979
00:51:28.035 --> 00:51:30.414
Is that about right?

980
00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:32.146
- They've all been fringe productions.

981
00:51:32.146 --> 00:51:33.787
- Who's gonna go one better?

982
00:51:33.787 --> 00:51:34.986
- I trolled a production I was in once

983
00:51:34.986 --> 00:51:37.373
'cause I didn't like the director.

984
00:51:37.373 --> 00:51:40.675
He was all over this other
actress in the rehearsal

985
00:51:40.675 --> 00:51:41.789
and at the time I was going through

986
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:43.302
some weird religious thing

987
00:51:43.302 --> 00:51:45.916
and I'd got ditched by my boyfriend.

988
00:51:45.916 --> 00:51:46.749
So to be honest.

989
00:51:46.749 --> 00:51:48.650
I was just jealous of any guy
giving another girl attention.

990
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.784
And it just went down hill from there.

991
00:51:51.784 --> 00:51:54.848
- Ah. and 'cause said
director didn't love you.

992
00:51:54.848 --> 00:51:58.147
you decided he was a piece of shit.

993
00:51:58.147 --> 00:51:59.064
- Probably.

994
00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:02.901
- You're doing this for the wrong reason.

995
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:07.012
Just like you thought
religion was the answer.

996
00:52:07.012 --> 00:52:10.502
That script was blasphemous wasn't it?

997
00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:13.335
And you wouldn't blaspheme at all.

998
00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:16.601
Not once in that rehearsal process

999
00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:21.601
could you bring yourself to
utter the words. Jesus Christ.

1000
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:22.803
- Christ.

1001
00:52:24.593 --> 00:52:26.762
How would you know that?

1002
00:52:26.762 --> 00:52:28.643
- It's in the script.

1003
00:52:28.643 --> 00:52:30.735
I know the director. don't I?

1004
00:52:30.735 --> 00:52:32.485
Why are you all here?

1005
00:52:33.503 --> 00:52:35.963
Has none of you picked up on this yet?

1006
00:52:35.963 --> 00:52:38.490
You are all connected
to me by a third party

1007
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.359
yet you're so superficial
and self-absorbed

1008
00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:44.686
that not one of you has
bothered to work out the link.

1009
00:52:44.686 --> 00:52:47.686
(quiet eerie music)

1010
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:54.493
(gentle music)

1011
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.607
(woman vocalising)

1012
00:53:35.637 --> 00:53:36.720
- Hi. Shelby.

1013
00:53:38.098 --> 00:53:39.431
Why'd you do it?

1014
00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:44.878
Why did you tell everyone that
I started doing webcam work?

1015
00:53:44.878 --> 00:53:48.071
You were the only one
that knew I was doing it.

1016
00:53:48.071 --> 00:53:50.234
I wore a mask. had a persona.

1017
00:53:50.234 --> 00:53:52.067
Nobody knew it was me.

1018
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:57.135
But suddenly the comments
started sounding really familiar

1019
00:53:57.135 --> 00:54:00.425
but I didn't care 'cause
the gifts kept turning up.

1020
00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:01.963
The money kept pouring in

1021
00:54:01.963 --> 00:54:04.130
and just like me it hasn't stopped coming

1022
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.297
for the past three months.

1023
00:54:07.153 --> 00:54:08.232
But little by little.

1024
00:54:08.232 --> 00:54:11.432
people started treating me differently.

1025
00:54:11.432 --> 00:54:14.909
All the guys in my class
started turning up to watch

1026
00:54:14.909 --> 00:54:17.316
and now everyone knows what I've done

1027
00:54:17.316 --> 00:54:19.964
just to get through this.

1028
00:54:19.964 --> 00:54:22.525
And no one's gonna want to
hire me as a real actress

1029
00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:25.447
because apparently I'm not anymore.

1030
00:54:25.447 --> 00:54:27.920
I'm every name under the
sun and thanks to you.

1031
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.337
everyone I know has tuned in.

1032
00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:33.239
So I thought I'd pull some strings

1033
00:54:33.239 --> 00:54:37.982
and see if I can grab people's
attention a different way.

1034
00:54:37.982 --> 00:54:39.302
Don't come back to the flat.

1035
00:54:39.302 --> 00:54:42.436
I've already sent your
stuff to your parents.

1036
00:54:42.436 --> 00:54:43.337
And don't bother playing

1037
00:54:43.337 --> 00:54:46.670
that single white female shit on Maisie.

1038
00:54:47.505 --> 00:54:48.588
She's clever.

1039
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.157
You just wanted to control
me and I didn't even realise.

1040
00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.490
I was never ill.

1041
00:54:56.582 --> 00:54:58.079
You kept me indoors.

1042
00:54:58.079 --> 00:54:59.946
You locked me in my room for two weeks.

1043
00:54:59.946 --> 00:55:01.386
You wouldn't even let me use the toilet

1044
00:55:01.386 --> 00:55:04.165
and I didn't think anything of it.

1045
00:55:04.165 --> 00:55:07.950
It was you who put me
onto the webcam work.

1046
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.153
And you knew I'd go for it

1047
00:55:10.153 --> 00:55:13.236
because I'm vain and I like attention

1048
00:55:14.299 --> 00:55:18.299
and I can cope with knowing
that people want me.

1049
00:55:19.213 --> 00:55:21.963
(dramatic music)

1050
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.157
- I never did anything like that. Maddie.

1051
00:56:22.451 --> 00:56:24.368
- Shelby. yes. you did.

1052
00:56:26.278 --> 00:56:28.316
You're a freak.

1053
00:56:28.316 --> 00:56:29.755
I've been trying to get you out of my flat

1054
00:56:29.755 --> 00:56:31.505
for three months now.

1055
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:33.883
You're a psycho.

1056
00:56:34.843 --> 00:56:37.005
You let me degrade myself
because you could watch

1057
00:56:37.005 --> 00:56:38.603
from the room next door knowing

1058
00:56:38.603 --> 00:56:41.848
that I couldn't make a
single move to get out.

1059
00:56:41.848 --> 00:56:44.848
For all that time you controlled me.

1060
00:56:46.618 --> 00:56:49.077
You put me in jail and
I threw away the key

1061
00:56:49.077 --> 00:56:52.844
because that's what you told me to do.

1062
00:56:52.844 --> 00:56:54.676
You convinced me I was
a thousand times worse

1063
00:56:54.676 --> 00:56:56.901
than I actually was.

1064
00:56:56.901 --> 00:56:58.452
You're the one who is ill.

1065
00:56:58.452 --> 00:57:01.889
You're the one who is sick. Shelby.

1066
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:04.164
And you know what you're mistake was?

1067
00:57:04.164 --> 00:57:08.167
(laughs) You told me you couldn't
sing and you couldn't act.

1068
00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:11.042
Oh. but I found you in Edinburgh.

1069
00:57:11.042 --> 00:57:13.792
What a little performer you were.

1070
00:57:14.962 --> 00:57:16.744
You've never stopped.

1071
00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:18.887
You just changed your
name and dyed your hair.

1072
00:57:18.887 --> 00:57:19.720
- Stop it.

1073
00:57:27.391 --> 00:57:30.249
Who are all these people?

1074
00:57:30.249 --> 00:57:34.623
- Sorry. I'm actually just
an actor hired by her.

1075
00:57:34.623 --> 00:57:36.540
I'm part of their show.

1076
00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:39.177
She was gonna tour with it

1077
00:57:39.177 --> 00:57:42.094
and do some topical bollocks on it.

1078
00:57:43.797 --> 00:57:45.214
- This is a show?

1079
00:57:46.715 --> 00:57:49.820
But. Maddie. they don't
even know your real name.

1080
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.940
You're MSN Hottie. right.

1081
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.374
- [Maddie] Melody Shelby-Night Hottie.

1082
00:57:55.374 --> 00:57:57.805
MSN Hottie. right. bitch?

1083
00:57:57.805 --> 00:57:59.262
I let them know my real name.

1084
00:57:59.262 --> 00:58:02.694
Oh. and my private videos are free now.

1085
00:58:02.694 --> 00:58:05.284
- I never did what you do.

1086
00:58:05.284 --> 00:58:07.284
- Uh. you re-enacted it.

1087
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:12.985
Pressing record on your
laptop kinda proves that.

1088
00:58:12.985 --> 00:58:14.294
Well. sorry. if I went to an extreme

1089
00:58:14.294 --> 00:58:18.879
but you're twisted and
you really fucked me up.

1090
00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:23.812
- I know I've got problems
but Melody Shelby-Night.

1091
00:58:23.812 --> 00:58:25.729
That really is my name.

1092
00:58:28.036 --> 00:58:31.619
Whatever I used before.
that was fake. but.

1093
00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:36.414
you've put my name out there like that.

1094
00:58:36.414 --> 00:58:38.631
that's my real name.

1095
00:58:38.631 --> 00:58:41.048
- It's only what you deserve.

1096
00:58:42.544 --> 00:58:46.941
- I did everything for
you when you were ill.

1097
00:58:46.941 --> 00:58:50.274
- Well. then maybe. I'm just ungrateful.

1098
00:58:53.249 --> 00:58:54.934
- How did you get here?

1099
00:58:54.934 --> 00:58:57.434
- I've got a car. I can drive.

1100
00:58:59.611 --> 00:59:02.527
You can't play a Queen Bee. Shelby.

1101
00:59:02.527 --> 00:59:05.187
I know every trick in the book.

1102
00:59:05.187 --> 00:59:07.868
No one ever has to know
that I did shit online.

1103
00:59:07.868 --> 00:59:09.477
No one even cares

1104
00:59:09.477 --> 00:59:13.310
and yeah. I made a
fuckload so lick it. bitch.

1105
00:59:15.471 --> 00:59:18.054
(gentle music)

1106
00:59:26.986 --> 00:59:29.854
- You're Maddie's best
friend from primary school.

1107
00:59:29.854 --> 00:59:34.854
(laughs) I recognised you as
soon as you opened the door.

1108
00:59:36.024 --> 00:59:38.524
I can't believe you set me up.

1109
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:41.478
- Wow.

1110
00:59:42.792 --> 00:59:44.209
This is dynamite.

1111
00:59:45.396 --> 00:59:46.891
It's like a full-on domestic

1112
00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:49.260
in the middle of an acting workshop.

1113
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:54.110
- (laughs) You're just an actor then?

1114
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.443
Do you know her?

1115
00:59:59.006 --> 01:00:01.173
- Not until she turned up.

1116
01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.474
- And that was all improv?

1117
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.872
- Mostly.

1118
01:00:06.872 --> 01:00:09.455
(gentle music)

1119
01:00:11.157 --> 01:00:13.740

She's gone. Maddie.

1134
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.643
Sorry. everyone.

1135
01:01:00.643 --> 01:01:02.819
The show really is over.

1136
01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:04.136
You can all go home now.

1137
01:01:04.136 --> 01:01:06.512
the money's already been sent out.

1138
01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:09.679
Any questions. sue us. we don't exist.

1139
01:01:10.974 --> 01:01:12.880
If you're lucky the press might call you.

1140
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.602
They might not.

1141
01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:15.769
This was real.

1142
01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:19.498
Shelby has basically kept Maddie hostage

1143
01:01:19.498 --> 01:01:22.998
in her own flat for the past three months.

1144
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.413
- We're actors.

1145
01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:30.506
We've done a million
schlock workshops like this.

1146
01:01:30.506 --> 01:01:32.839
I mean. it's a great gimmick

1147
01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:38.637
but I want to see where
you're going to take it.

1148
01:01:38.637 --> 01:01:41.220
"The Mist" is gonna be amazing.

1149
01:01:42.872 --> 01:01:44.872
- "The Mist" isn't real.

1150
01:01:49.446 --> 01:01:51.696
Do I have to say it again?

1151
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.051
Maddie had been held hostage

1152
01:01:55.051 --> 01:01:58.312
by her psychotic flatmate
for the past three months.

1153
01:01:58.312 --> 01:02:00.977
We came up with this ridiculous situation

1154
01:02:00.977 --> 01:02:03.999
to get Shelby out of her life.

1155
01:02:03.999 --> 01:02:05.506
- [Eleanor] I really want
to be part of "The Mist"

1156
01:02:05.506 --> 01:02:07.125
but I've gotta go get my train

1157
01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.669
so I can email you for
more details. right?

1158
01:02:09.669 --> 01:02:12.669
- Yeah. but in the meantime. please.

1159
01:02:14.077 --> 01:02:14.910
Fuck off.

1160
01:02:16.939 --> 01:02:17.947
Come on.

1161
01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:19.030
Off you fuck.

1162
01:02:34.491 --> 01:02:35.741
Fucking actors.

1163
01:02:36.816 --> 01:02:40.566
Are we not being genuinely
distraught enough?

1164
01:02:42.543 --> 01:02:46.285
(Maddie sobbing)
(gentle music)

1165
01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:48.535
- I'm not sure how to feel.

1166
01:02:51.592 --> 01:02:52.783
- How the fuck did you even get involved

1167
01:02:52.783 --> 01:02:54.913
with that girl. Maddie?

1168
01:02:54.913 --> 01:02:56.530
I mean. I kinda liked her

1169
01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.762
but I don't think she would've liked me.

1170
01:02:59.762 --> 01:03:02.264
- I wish you'd said that three months ago.

1171
01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:04.847
All she wanted was a boyfriend.

1172
01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:09.916
It was the night you moved
back in with your parents.

1173
01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:12.749
A week and a half before lockdown?

1174
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.889
- The argument?

1175
01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:16.215
- You moved out. she moved in.

1176
01:03:16.215 --> 01:03:17.048
Two years. Ben.

1177
01:03:17.048 --> 01:03:18.056
Why did we split up?

1178
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.487
- (scoffs) Because I run out of money

1179
01:03:28.487 --> 01:03:30.987
and I made an idiot of myself.

1180
01:03:34.433 --> 01:03:36.803
Where'd you even meet her?

1181
01:03:36.803 --> 01:03:38.678
- Revolution.

1182
01:03:38.678 --> 01:03:39.940
Charlie vouched for her.

1183
01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.857
- Charlie? He vouches for everyone.

1184
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.773
- She's done this same thing
to a lot of other girls before.

1185
01:03:46.773 --> 01:03:49.175
- Just be honest.
Maisie. she did it to you

1186
01:03:49.175 --> 01:03:52.187
but it never went further than
the fucking computer screen.

1187
01:03:52.187 --> 01:03:54.951
- (laughs) Jesus.

1188
01:03:54.951 --> 01:03:57.618
You all pull me in on some shit.

1189
01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:06.375
- Wait. she. she's left her bag. (groans)

1190
01:04:14.629 --> 01:04:16.462
What the fuck is that?

1191
01:04:22.353 --> 01:04:24.650
No. come on. what the fuck is that?

1192
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.626
She leave cakes in the oven?

1193
01:04:27.626 --> 01:04:30.709
See what else is in that bitches bag.

1194
01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:36.139
(woman vocalising)

1195
01:04:46.555 --> 01:04:47.972
- I'm in trouble.

1196
01:04:48.923 --> 01:04:51.835
I've been running out
of medication for weeks

1197
01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:54.932
and now there's nothing
left in my system at all.

1198
01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:58.403
I'm gonna have a psychotic episode.

1199
01:04:58.403 --> 01:05:01.118
Or pass out or. I don't know.

1200
01:05:01.118 --> 01:05:03.118

thank you for giving me

this opportunity to get back into work.

1221
01:06:14.661 --> 01:06:17.108
Lots of love. Shelby.

1223
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:28.338
"Dear Production Team.

1224
01:06:28.338 --> 01:06:29.964
thank you for letting me participate

1225
01:06:29.964 --> 01:06:32.852
in your workshop at short notice.

01:06:32.852 --> 01:06:34.685
Kind regards. Shelby."

1227
01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:42.622
- Why the fuck is there
a timer in her bag?

1228
01:06:43.711 --> 01:06:45.416
- She microdoses her medication

1229
01:06:45.416 --> 01:06:47.999
to stay stable through the day.

1230
01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:53.266
She told me she was either
running out of her medication

1231
01:06:53.266 --> 01:06:55.652
or someone close to her was stealing it

1232
01:06:55.652 --> 01:06:59.819
because they she knew she
would act up without it.

1233
01:07:00.753 --> 01:07:03.032
I'm sorry. Maddie.

1234
01:07:03.032 --> 01:07:05.163
I didn't do any of this for you.

1235
01:07:05.163 --> 01:07:09.913
I did it so that you would

and I've mocked someone for a long time

1239
01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:22.419
who never deserved to be mocked.

It's over.

1241
01:07:27.966 --> 01:07:31.883

don't put on this play.

You can come and clean up.

1247
01:07:58.183 --> 01:07:59.296
Ah. yeah. all good thank you.

1248
01:07:59.296 --> 01:08:01.213

1255
01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:22.411
78 days of fear and loathing
in your couped up mind.

1256
01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:26.860
I'm doing my best to release the pressure.

1257
01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.527
Unwind. appreciate your leisure.

1258

Drop a track that clicks
your mind into gear.

Admit that maybe our situation
has been running on too long.
