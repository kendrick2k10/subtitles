00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:11.177
When I come up with ideas.
they'll just start from a very primal.

4
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.139
"I just want to see
this cute thing on screen."

5
00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.600
and then I'll find the meaning
and the metaphor and the themes

6
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.562
<i>to justify why it should be that.</i>

7
00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.773
But really. it just came from a place
of "Oh. they're so cute."

8
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.818
and "Wouldn't it be awesome
if they were gigantic?"

9
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.362
I'm excited.

10
00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.698
What's the panda's name again?
Tenzin.

11
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.451
And then the girl was
the older one. right?

12
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.121
Didn't realize they'd be so small.

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.624
<i>Real red pandas are really cute.</i>

14
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.587
And I think that's the main reason why
I was drawn to making a story about them.

15
00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.505
It's got kind of a belly sometimes.

16
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.676
They're very tubular
and they have very long. fluffy tails.

17
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.428
<i>more pointed snouts.</i>

18
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.096
The tail's about 18 inches.

19
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.973
Oh.

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.811
They feel a little cat-like.
kind of raccoon. kind of bear.

21
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.147
Maybe a little splash
of monkey or something.

22
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.983
Look at it. Aw!

23
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.736
<i>They're totally solitary.</i>

24
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.863
<i>They don't really communicate
with one another.</i>

25
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.865
They're kind of like teenagers.

26
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.451
- I like the long...
- That one's like an old one.

27
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.203
<i>I found a lot of parallels</i>

28
00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.914
<i>between red pandas and Mei
and her story.</i>

29
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.458
<i>Like. red pandas
are very attached to their mom.</i>

30
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.710
<i>They sleep all day.</i>

31
00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.797
<i>They eat bamboo. but they're not
supposed to eat bamboo.</i>

32
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.382
<i>bamboo doesn't give them
enough nutrients.</i>

33
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.885
<i>So I imagine
it's just like a lazy teenager.</i>

34
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.887
<i>just eating chips
and sleeping all day.</i>

35
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.847
<i>They're native to China.</i>

36
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.226
<i>And then also. it's like red and white.</i>

37
00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:45.271
<i>It's like Chinese. but also like
the colors of the Canadian flag. too.</i>

38
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.982
<i>So it felt like the perfect animal</i>

39
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:51.986
to tell this story about this
- Chinese-
- Canadian teenage girl.

40
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.073
I'm Meilin Lee.

41
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.368
And ever since I turned 13.
I've been doing my own thing.

42
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:02.122
Making my own moves. 24/7. 365.

43
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.999
<i>Turning Red</i> is about Mei.

44
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:09.337
- <i>a Chinese-
- Canadian girl living in Toronto in 2002.</i>

45
00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.797
<i>It's very specific.</i>

46
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.215
It's a mother-daughter story.

47
00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.469
At its most base level.
this film is about growing up

48
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.180
and figuring out who you are
and embracing that.

49
00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.473
Mei-
- Mei...

50
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:21.766
Coming!

51
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:27.480
<i>Everything changes for Mei
when she wakes up one morning</i>

52
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:32.402
<i>and discovers she's a giant.
eight-foot-tall furry red panda.</i>

53
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.364
and she realizes
"Oh. I can control this transformation.

54
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:44.038
<i>"If I just stay completely calm
and even for the rest of my life.</i>

55
00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.791
<i>"I will stay human and it'll be A-okay."</i>

56
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.168
Yes.

57
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.880
But that's not how life works.

58
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.132
Oh. crap.

59
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.801
Mom!

60
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.892
So the red panda is basically
a metaphor for magical puberty.

61
00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.062
<i>Just seeing how this girl</i>

62
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.523
<i>who thought she had everything
under control.</i>

63
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.443
<i>suddenly big and hairy and smelly.</i>

64
00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.695
<i>an emotional wreck.</i>

65
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.238
<i>4*TOWN forever?</i>

66
00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.366
<i>This panda is incredibly cute.</i>

67
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.703
It's also true to that time
in a girl's life.

68
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.538
In some ways. it's the worst time.

69
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.000
<i>You're not a kid.
and you're not an adult.</i>

70
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.753
<i>This poor girl.
she's looking in a mirror</i>

71
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:36.257
<i>and seeing that
she's got hair everywhere and she stinks.</i>

72
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.636
<i>and she's big
and doesn't fit through the doorway.</i>

73
00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.846
<i>Panda Mei is only
half in control.</i>

74
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.558
She's having a great time.
but then she's like "Auughhh."

75
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:46.935
<i>And like. I don't know.</i>

76
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.979
<i>that feels very much like
what my teenager years were like.</i>

77
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.773
<i>Ah OOGa!</i>

78
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.651
<i>It's bodily. it's emotional.</i>

79
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.905
<i>It's all about. "Can I embrace this?
Can I grow into it?</i>

80
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.491
<i>"Can I still love who I am</i>

81
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.536
"knowing that I've become someone
that I'm not used to?"

82
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.874
It's all going according to plan.
This is about right.

83
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.335
<i>It's the first time in my career</i>

84
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.422
<i>where all of the key leadership
on the show are women.</i>

85
00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.259
<i>and I feel like
that sets a very different vibe.</i>

86
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.469
It's completely amazing

87
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.722
to have this all-women leadership team.

88
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.268
<i>I have spent the entirety
of my career in meetings</i>

89
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.478
<i>where I was one of very few women.</i>

90
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.065
<i>Now sitting there and making plans
and it's all women in the room</i>

91
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.610
has been this really crazy thing
and very different for me.

92
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.279
Everything's different
about this film.

93
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.824
I don't know how to answer that question
without starting with Domee.

94
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.868
She's a good girl. Just like I was.

95
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.578
I first heard of Domee

96
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:52.166
<i>through seeing one of her
ten-second animation clips.</i>

97
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.046
<i>I was in college. and it was something
that she posted on her blog.</i>

98
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:07.890
It was this dancing. twerking hamster
to a K-pop song.

99
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.436
<i>"Who is this girl?</i>

100
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.565
<i>"She's probably going to be
a really funny director one day."</i>

101
00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.485
When I first started this movie.

102
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.780
I was really determined
to make something different.

103
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:26.242
We're going to be spending
four or five years of our life on this.

104
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.702
we've got to go big.

105
00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.288
I'm Domee Shi.
the director of <i>Red.</i>

106
00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.373
and ever since we started
making this movie.

107
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:38.504
we've been breaking convention
and making people laugh 24/7. 365.

108
00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.883
Ah. legally. it's nine-to-five. 261.

109
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.052
Whoo!

110
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.429
<i>On this show.
we wear what we want.</i>

111
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.722
<i>say what we want.</i>

112
00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.350
<i>and we will not hesitate
to do spontaneous cartwheels</i>

113
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.434
<i>if we feel so moved.</i>

114
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.811
Domee is a force of nature.

115
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.397
<i>She is a first-time feature director.</i>

116
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.484
It's been a while since I've worked
with a first-time director before.

117
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.568
and I'm loving it.

118
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.363
In conclusion. welcome to <i>Red!</i>

119
00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.827
Lights? Pitch.

120
00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.247
Did that actually change anything?
Yes. it did.

121
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:18.044
- So. welcome. everyone.
- Just ignore the camera. everyone.

122
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.215
- It's not there.
- Don't look right here.

123
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.135
<i>Making the film.
it's just been like a long marathon.</i>

124
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.847
<i>But in the first couple of years.
it was mostly me.</i>

125
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.600
<i>and Julia. our screenwriter.</i>

126
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.353
<i>head of story. Rosie Sullivan.</i>

127
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.564
<i>the story team.
and then Nick. our editor.</i>

128
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.441
<i>And we were just working
on the reels.</i>

129
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.362
<i>Yeah. it feels like
you're part of a pirate ship.</i>

130
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.369
<i>Because you're all kind of just working
and sweating for these drawings.</i>

131
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:55.540
<i>and you're all aiming to make
the director react or respond.</i>

132
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.464
I started working with her.
and pretty quickly.

133
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:07.218
I felt like this woman
is really impressive.

134
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.054
<i>Also. incredibly clear in her vision.</i>

135
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.889
And then ta-da. and like.

136
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:15.309
imagine it to look
like a comic book background.

137
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.520
Thank you. Margaret.
Great work.

138
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.733
She is so unique
in how she thinks about movies.

139
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.444
how she communicates her vision.

140
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.362
<i>her humor. her tone.</i>

141
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.116
I just thought I'd get this in front of
you to see if it lives within our world.

142
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.827
- Is that what we're looking for?
- Yes. Yes. Sorry.

143
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.582
I feel like I have to be more
of a director now for the camera.

144
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.959
The crew slowly grew bigger and bigger.

145
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.546
To give you a general sense
of the BG buildings.

146
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:47.216
This reminds me of Toronto a lot.
a lot of these old buildings.

147
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.095
And then last year.
it just exploded.

148
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.973
And that was during
the pandemic.

149
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.391
It just so happens that

150
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.854
the busiest time on the show
was when we were all working from home.

151
00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.482
Hi. Frankie. Hi. bubba.

152
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.276
<i>It may not be obvious. I don't know.</i>

153
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.154
<i>but making films is a huge team effort.</i>

154
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:12.116
<i>and so. the more you can collaborate
with the people around you.</i>

155
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.035
<i>the better the movie is going to be.</i>

156
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:19.707
<i>As we were leaving to walk out
the door for getting sent home.</i>

157
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:24.420
<i>Domee said. "Well. maybe I could do
like a coffee time or something</i>

158
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.881
<i>"just so we can keep
in touch with the crew.</i>

159
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.300
And we all went. "Oh. what a great idea."

160
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.177
<i>And in the beginning. it really was</i>

161
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.846
<i>kind of this awesome thing
of just being able to see</i>

162
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.516
<i>more than like three people in your life.</i>

163
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.644
<i>And also getting to hear from
the director weekly is pretty cool.</i>

164
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.396
...Mei's struggle throughout act two...

165
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.649
Even if sometimes
it's just a little update.

166
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.026
it felt like some kind of connection.

167
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:52.281
We are starting with a couple of
nominations from our dailies team.

168
00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.742
<i>I've been really surprised</i>

169
00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:59.080
<i>because we routinely get a hundred
and something people coming to it.</i>

170
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.169
Oh! Thank you!

171
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:10.383
Exceptionally bad and so out of key.
But I really love it.

172
00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:12.635
Here's to a better 2021.

173
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.639
<i>We're coming together in some of
the best way you can do during a pandemic</i>

174
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.100
<i>with a giant movie crew.
so it's been pretty cool.</i>

175
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:32.238
<i>My job is Visual Effects
Supervisor on the film.</i>

176
00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.991
First woman in 20 years at Pixar
to have that job.

177
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:38.369
<i>For almost 15 years.
I was a lighting DP.</i>

178
00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.581
<i>and so most of my career at Pixar
has been about lighting.</i>

179
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.500
<i>thinking about how to make
the most beautiful movie possible.</i>

180
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.961
<i>how to make a great experience
for the lighting team...</i>

181
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.755
A little bit of this.
even though that would catch the light.

182
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.424
<i>How to engage with the director.</i>

183
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.844
<i>how to coordinate with other departments.
how to do groundbreaking stuff.</i>

184
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.470
And now I'm in this new role.

185
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.515
<i>overseeing heavily tech
and some of the creative.</i>

186
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.518
<i>and I am now in the leadership group
of running the movie.</i>

187
00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:08.941
<i>And then at the same time.
I became a mother for the first time.</i>

188
00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.611
<i>I have twins. a boy and a girl.</i>

189
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.946
Ah!

190
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.241
<i>I don't know that I ever thought
I was going to have kids.</i>

191
00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:22.580
<i>You know. there's days where it feels
completely overwhelming. I would say.</i>

192
00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:25.333
Yay!
Yay!

193
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.922
But I also am now a year and a half
into being a mother.

194
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.803
<i>And I'm two years into this position.</i>

195
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:43.392
<i>I love both things dearly. and it's hard
to imagine not having them now.</i>

196
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:48.356
And I got married to my amazing wife.

197
00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.566
Hello.
Hello.

198
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.486
You guys. it's Mommy!

199
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.404
Hi. guys.

200
00:10:56.072 --> 00:11:00.242
<i>Paige is a battalion chief
for the Alameda County Fire Department.</i>

201
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.120
<i>She's the highest ranking woman
of that department.</i>

202
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.581
<i>which I'm neverendingly proud about.</i>

203
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.834
<i>She would not love that I'm bragging
about her. but I love to brag about her.</i>

204
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.503
<i>It's one of my favorite topics.</i>

205
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.131
Are you gonna be able
to jump into the end credit?

206
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.925
We're moving it up to 2:30. I think.

207
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.512
This is Lindsey Collins.
She is the producer of <i>Turning Red.</i>

208
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:24.725
<i>The producer is the one orchestrating
this giant circus.</i>

209
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.186
- The ringmaster?
- She is the ringmaster.

210
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:33.067
<i>When people are going "Auggghhh"
Lindsey is like. "Okay. let's make a plan.</i>

211
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:34.985
"Let's figure out
how to make this happen."

212
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.487
So in the race to get this done.

213
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:40.282
we're probably just going to be working
on top of each other. which is great.

214
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.703
Lindsey is so smart. I think she's
always like a million steps ahead.

215
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.707
<i>so that I can worry about
what's happening in the present.</i>

216
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.669
<i>I'm really good at working
within boxes and limitations</i>

217
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:55.005
and she was really good about
drawing them out for me

218
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.508
to be crazy and push up against.

219
00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:01.345
Just to draw the storyline together
maybe a little bit clearer...

220
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:05.433
<i>I feel like I learned so much just by
watching her and working with her</i>

221
00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.768
and I see it as the partner
to the director.

222
00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:12.148
<i>So that includes being a creative partner.
but also managing the crew</i>

223
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.734
<i>and surrounding her
with all the right people.</i>

224
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.610
<i>You're in every meeting.</i>

225
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:20.364
you always offer ways
to move story along

226
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:25.286
and you help production through.
not just by managing it.

227
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:29.206
but also just from an emotional.
creative side as well.

228
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.583
- You do.
- Thank you. Rona.

229
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.334
I kind of like it when...

230
00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.794
<i>This is Rona Liu.</i>

231
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.505
She's the production designer
of <i>Turning Red.</i>

232
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:41.093
<i>The production designer
is the first person brought on the show</i>

233
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.928
<i>after the producer and director.</i>

234
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.348
You know. we're talking about the values
being super. super crunched.

235
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.185
<i>And that's basically because
from the very beginning.</i>

236
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.813
<i>their job is to figure out
what the movie is going to look like.</i>

237
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:57.985
<i>And that is everything from characters
to sets to color to tone and style.</i>

238
00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:01.697
<i>My role is to collaborate
closely with the director.</i>

239
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.408
and make sure that her vision translates

240
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.244
throughout all of the department
and onto the screen.

241
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.872
<i>Welcome. everyone.</i>

242
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.624
<i>Today. we're going to kick it off</i>

243
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.169
<i>with Athena and the panda
costume shaping.</i>

244
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.545
For her tail.

245
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.006
the lighter part
can take on some of that red.

246
00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:24.178
I know I'm providing information that
other people need to get their work done.

247
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:29.433
Let's tone the two sides
where there is the star and the heart.

248
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:33.395
<i>I feel like that's the most important
part of my job. is to just make sure</i>

249
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.107
that everybody else feels good
about the work that they're doing.

250
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.317
Okay.

251
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.985
<i>Good job. everyone. Thank you.</i>

252
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.612
- Thank you. Bye.
- <i>-
- Thanks.</i>

253
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.785
<i>Being pregnant while we're
in the crunch of things</i>

254
00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:51.789
<i>definitely made me have to just
trust my team a lot more.</i>

255
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.541
<i>It's the first time in my life</i>

256
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.752
<i>where I was comfortable
telling my manager. Sophia.</i>

257
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.629
<i>I need to take some time to nap.</i>

258
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.131
<i>So that does make sense.</i>

259
00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.175
Hey. Rona. where are we?

260
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.220
We're in the living room area.

261
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.597
This is the entrance to our house.

262
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.350
This is our kitty.

263
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.853
And this is my soon-to-be-husband.

264
00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.814
- We're getting Zoom-married on Friday.
- Mmm-hmm.

265
00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:20.818
We've been engaged for so long.
we figured now's a good time to do it.

266
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.611
Yeah.

267
00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:27.825
<i>Being able to step away.</i>

268
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:31.829
<i>touch base with a loved one
and to say. "Hey. how's your day going?"</i>

269
00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:36.458
<i>and just being really connected
in both of our lives for the first time.</i>

270
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:40.004
<i>that's been really comforting.</i>

271
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.885
I'm an only child.

272
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.637
and my dad had to go away to work a lot.

273
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.973
So a lot of the time.
it was just me and my mom.

274
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.769
<i>We'd go on Chinese bus tours.</i>

275
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:59.523
<i>Like she'd pick the locations.</i>

276
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.192
<i>And she would take us to Atlanta.</i>

277
00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.778
<i>or Halifax.</i>

278
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:05.863
<i>Prince Edward Island.</i>

279
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.991
<i>Maybe not like. upfront.
the most exciting places.</i>

280
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:13.537
<i>but we would spend a good ton of time
just together on the bus talking.</i>

281
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.539
<i>It was good at first.</i>

282
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.834
<i>but like everybody.
you grow up and you change</i>

283
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.670
<i>and you want to have your own friends
and your own life.</i>

284
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:26.008
<i>and it's kind of just about
how that transition happens.</i>

285
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.470
I love the lighting.

286
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.430
I love everything in this sequence.

287
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.806
Great work. you guys.

288
00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.227
<i>It's been a long time
since I was 13.</i>

289
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.774
<i>But I just remember it being
a lot of highs and lows.</i>

290
00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:45.194
It's such a turbulent time
in a person's life.

291
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.446
especially a girl's. I think.

292
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.324
Small things can feel
super. super important.

293
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:54.119
<i>and you could love something
one day and hate it the other.</i>

294
00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.080
I didn't even like 4*TOWN last year.

295
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.958
but now they're literally
the greatest thing

296
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.584
that's ever happened to me.

297
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:04.004
This film is very personal
to me in that

298
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:08.592
it was very much inspired by my own life
growing up in Toronto

299
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:13.222
<i>and being the only child
of my overprotective mom and dad.</i>

300
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.602
<i>We are about to hop onto
a Zoom call with my parents</i>

301
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:22.272
<i>and they are going to dig through
all of the artwork and things</i>

302
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.692
<i>that I've ever created in my life.</i>

303
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.235
<i>They've collected all of it.</i>

304
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.903
Yeah. everything. Everything.

305
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.154
It's my parents!

306
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:30.948
<i>Hi!</i>

307
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.287
How's it going? Is it weird having
a whole camera crew in the house?

308
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.918
<i>They live in Toronto. Canada.</i>

309
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.088
<i>Still in the same house
that I grew up in.</i>

310
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.924
<i>pretty much looks exactly the same
every time I go back.</i>

311
00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:56.974
Yeah. And then you replied as Santa Claus.

312
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:05.941
Why would Santa Claus ever say that?

313
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:17.161
<i>She wrote a table of contents.
a foreword.</i>

314
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.997
<i>Can you read some of your foreword?</i>

315
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.425
So my dad would be like my art tutor.

316
00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.886
but my mom would encourage
my writing.

317
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.895
- Aw. the Wi-
- Fi sucks.

318
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.399
He's saying nice things about me.
and I can't hear it.

319
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.319
<i>He's never this generous with his praise.
Come on!</i>

320
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.032
Yeah. Why is it... It's so big.

321
00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.658
<i>In the living room.</i>

322
00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:01.038
<i>there's like an ever-growing shrine
dedicated to me.</i>

323
00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:03.457
<i>It looks like they really love me</i>

324
00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:06.919
and that I'm dead or something.

325
00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:13.967
Yeah. I remember the judge.

326
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:17.262
I heard you guys collected
all of my sketchbooks.

327
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.014
<i>Let's look through them together.</i>

328
00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.642
- Pokémon.
- <i>-
- Yeah. Pokémon.</i>

329
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:23.435
<i>That's middle school.</i>

330
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:27.314
And then high school is when I started
drawing a lot of beautiful people.

331
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.776
<i>It's boys. If there's boys.
then it's close to high school.</i>

332
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.904
- <i>-
- Oh. my God.</i>

333
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.116
This is so embarrassing.

334
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.827
There was this fan art contest
that I entered.

335
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:42.955
where it's like
draw Draco's children.

336
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.125
<i>Okay. maybe we can look
at another sketchbook.</i>

337
00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.671
Mmm. Devon.

338
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.715
Ugh! May I remind you
what real men look like?

339
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.676
4*TOWN!

340
00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:01.348
<i>There's just so much comedy
in female adolescence</i>

341
00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.852
<i>that I don't see a lot of.
and I just can't wait to show people</i>

342
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.062
just how weird girls can be.

343
00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:11.024
because I was totally that as a teen

344
00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.402
and a young adult and now.

345
00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:19.283
I love how Mei is just a confident dork.

346
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:22.119
and she's unapologetic about it.

347
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.414
<i>I feel like she was the girl
that I wanted to be.</i>

348
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:29.376
There's so many elements of me in Mei.

349
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:34.882
Spunky. loud.
doesn't care what anyone thinks.

350
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.717
I accept and embrace all labels.

351
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.552
<i>Even though I was a total nerd.</i>

352
00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.097
I was so oblivious to that.
and I think that helped me.

353
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.559
<i>She herself
never questions who she is.</i>

354
00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.271
and I think she fights
what is expected of her.

355
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.649
But deep down.
she always knew who she was.

356
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.944
<i>and she was always
so accepting of herself.</i>

357
00:19:56.028 --> 00:20:00.073
I remember being that at some point.
and then. you know. hitting that age

358
00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:04.870
and then suddenly turning very. very shy
when I got acne. And then I was

359
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.499
very aware of my body and all that stuff.
and that's what I wanted to explore.

360
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:12.419
with Mei turning into a red panda.

361
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.255
<i>She's this girl
that has her life together.</i>

362
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.258
and then all of a sudden.
magical puberty hits.

363
00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:19.551
It's going to be okay.

364
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.803
No. it's not! Will you just get out?

365
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.138
Excuse me?

366
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.725
Are you serious?

367
00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:30.103
<i>For Mei. I really wanted her
to sound unique.</i>

368
00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.440
<i>I wanted her to feel like a real girl.</i>

369
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.525
Oh. my gosh. that was the best thing ever.

370
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.945
<i>And so we found Rosalie Chiang.</i>

371
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:42.741
It's like you feel bad about
turning her down because she's your mom.

372
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.493
<i>She just had this really great voice.</i>

373
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:47.246
<i>There was just like
a charming imperfection to it.</i>

374
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:54.378
<i>For Mei. it was important to
design her the way that we saw ourselves.</i>

375
00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:57.714
<i>Her face is round. her ankles are thick.</i>

376
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.343
<i>We definitely embraced her chunky cute.</i>

377
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:05.055
It's kind of our design aesthetic
for our characters and for our sets.

378
00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:09.309
<i>We were looking at each other's faces
and were like. "We got moles.</i>

379
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:10.519
<i>"She should have moles."</i>

380
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.897
- Then you're like. "Rona. you have..."
- "You have funny lips."

381
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:17.317
"You have that dip in your lip.
Let's put that in.

382
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.320
"Hey. Rona.
you have really patchy eyebrows."

383
00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:25.492
When that part of myself gets celebrated
and the director's like.

384
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.995
"Hey. I like that.
Let's put it in our main character."

385
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.789
you're like.
"Hey. why did I hate that for so long?"

386
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:33.834
Jin. Jin! It's happening!

387
00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.254
What are you doing?

388
00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:43.135
<i>For me. this story is so much
my day-to-day life.</i>

389
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.722
<i>I hate to admit. I'm much more the mom</i>

390
00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:51.601
<i>than the main character because I actually
have three kids who are teens.</i>

391
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:56.231
I am surrounded by teenagers
and hormones and puberty at work.

392
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.401
And then I go home.
and I am equally. if not more.

393
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.820
<i>surrounded by puberty
and hormones at home.</i>

394
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.239
Are you guys going to walk the dog?

395
00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:09.202
Will you take them together
or are you gonna take them separate?

396
00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.496
Bye. Thank you.

397
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.373
They've been very well-behaved.

398
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.294
It does not normally
go that smoothly.

399
00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:24.384
<i>The number one rule in my family?
Honor your parents.</i>

400
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:27.387
<i>They're the supreme beings
who gave you life...</i>

401
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:29.681
<i>The least you can do in return is...</i>

402
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.267
<i>every single thing they ask.</i>

403
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.480
I think both of us probably grew up
under a lot of pressure

404
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.024
- to. you know. make our parents proud.
- Yeah.

405
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.859
I had that pressure on myself.

406
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.070
Like. I was very high-strung.

407
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.988
<i>I was really into good grades.</i>

408
00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:50.118
<i>I was into the image of the perfect girl.</i>

409
00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.912
I never ask for anything.

410
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:55.957
My whole life I've been her perfect
- little Mei-
- Mei. Temple duties. grades...

411
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.834
- Violin!
- Tap dancing.

412
00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.170
Yeah. We've been so good.

413
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.672
If they don't trust us anyway.
then what's the point?

414
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.550
<i>Mei's struggle in this film is</i>

415
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:09.554
<i>she's torn between being her mom's
good little daughter.</i>

416
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:13.517
<i>and embracing her wild inner beast.</i>

417
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:19.898
<i>That is the universal struggle
that a lot of kids go through.</i>

418
00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:24.444
<i>especially. I think. immigrant kids.
there's definitely more of this obligation</i>

419
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:30.367
to carry on your family's legacy
and make sure that their sacrifices

420
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:34.704
<i>in coming to a new country aren't in vain.
But also. you're in a new country.</i>

421
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:37.707
<i>you're experiencing all of this
crazy. awesome stuff</i>

422
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:41.294
<i>that maybe your parents
didn't get to grow up with.</i>

423
00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:43.296
You're caught between two worlds.

424
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.757
and that's kind of
what I wanted to explore in Mei

425
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:50.512
<i>and also. like. literally caught between
being like a human girl and a panda.</i>

426
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.599
<i>I immigrated to the U.S.
when I was 10.</i>

427
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:59.604
<i>and my mom
is very much in her Eastern roots.</i>

428
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:01.481
<i>And when I came here. you know.</i>

429
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:05.652
<i>I was the good little Chinese girl
that I knew how to be.</i>

430
00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:09.781
and then as I get more and more exposed
to the Western culture

431
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:13.118
<i>and what it means
to be an American teenager.</i>

432
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.704
<i>my mom and I started to butt heads.</i>

433
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:20.959
I had to discover
how to bridge the gap

434
00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:24.671
between being a dutiful daughter.

435
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:28.049
<i>faithful to myself. and a good friend.</i>

436
00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:33.388
<i>In eighth grade.
I met my best friend. Aya Alaadel.</i>

437
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:36.016
<i>She really taught me</i>

438
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:40.520
<i>that girls can burp the alphabet.</i>

439
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.525
<i>Girls can want to play video games.</i>

440
00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:50.405
<i>If you trip and you fall on your face.
you can learn to laugh at yourself.</i>

441
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:53.617
<i>You don't have to be embarrassed
for your decisions.</i>

442
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.911
<i>for your mistakes. for who you are.</i>

443
00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:59.623
<i>She really opened my eyes to all of that.</i>

444
00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.125
This is Bao.

445
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.711
- This is...
- Your first baby.

446
00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:06.880
- Our first baby.
- Our first.

447
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.298
Our first baby.

448
00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:12.093
Rona designed
this cute little nose for him.

449
00:25:12.552 --> 00:25:13.762
<i>Used our own noses.</i>

450
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:16.556
You look like your mother.

451
00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:20.227
<i>I had this short film
that I was developing. that became</i> Bao.

452
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:24.105
<i>and Rona was one of the first people
that I roped into the story.</i>

453
00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:27.526
<i>I was like. "Dang. she can really paint
and she has really good taste</i>

454
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.110
<i>"and she seems really cool."</i>

455
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:32.989
<i>"I really need an art person
to like take this to the next level."</i>

456
00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:37.035
To be honest. I will follow you
to the ends of the Earth.

457
00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:40.830
I think Domee is just
a brilliant. brilliant mind.

458
00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:44.376
I just feel like we click
and we can be so open

459
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.169
in communicating with each other.

460
00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:50.924
<i>We're different enough
in certain areas of our tastes</i>

461
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:54.511
<i>that we can collaborate and create
something even better together</i>

462
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:56.930
<i>than if we worked on something separately.</i>

463
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.351
Hey. Bart. Hey. Lisa.

464
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:06.356
<i>In the movie. Mei and her family
own and take care of a family temple.</i>

465
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.317
<i>We took several trips</i>

466
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:13.071
<i>to different historic temples
around California</i>

467
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.866
<i>that were built by early Chinese settlers</i>

468
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.370
<i>just to get a feeling
of what these grassroots temples are like.</i>

469
00:26:21.454 --> 00:26:25.792
<i>I also spent time living behind
a temple with my grandma in China.</i>

470
00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:30.297
and I just remember
it being just a really lovely memory.

471
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:36.511
<i>I'd make candles. and we would sell them
to visitors of the temples.</i>

472
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:40.307
<i>And I'd learned how to pray properly
with my grandma.</i>

473
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.937
When we got to building the set
of the temple and dressing it.

474
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:50.483
<i>it was really cool seeing those details
that we saw at the temples</i>

475
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:52.569
<i>kind of pop up in the background.</i>

476
00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:54.946
Like. there's just a bottle
of vegetable oil.

477
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.283
<i>Like. cleaning supplies
tucked away in the corner.</i>

478
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.536
They've been around
since the Gold Rush era.

479
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.164
<i>All these immigrants
who came with so little</i>

480
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.208
<i>were able to cobble together
a little piece of home.</i>

481
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.502
<i>That kind of felt like
the immigrant spirit.</i>

482
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:11.463
<i>That kind of felt like me and Rona.</i>

483
00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.632
<i>and how we. in our art.</i>

484
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.926
we are inspired
by Eastern and Western stuff.

485
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:21.181
Should we try to match their face shapes?
You know. like a bell shape?

486
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.726
I remember you saying.
"Rona. this is not a Chinese film.

487
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:27.395
<i>"This is a coming of age film.</i>

488
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:31.483
<i>"but it just happens to be
about a Chinese girl."</i>

489
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.781
<i>We need to really tap into the mind
of a 13-year-old growing up in 2002.</i>

490
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.949
<i>growing up in Toronto.</i>

491
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:43.578
- What did we like when we were 13.
- Yeah.

492
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:47.248
And we liked <i>Sailor Moon.</i>
We liked anime.

493
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.670
<i>The fandoms are what got me
really into anime.</i>

494
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.424
I was drawing fan art passionately.
I had a secret sketchbook.

495
00:27:56.508 --> 00:28:00.345
<i>You join an online community.
you draw fan art.</i>

496
00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.097
<i>and other people
would comment on it.</i>

497
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:05.141
<i>and that would encourage you
to draw more. produce more.</i>

498
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:08.770
<i>And that's kind of just what
encouraged me to keep drawing.</i>

499
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:12.774
I think. as a kid.
it was such an escape.

500
00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:16.444
I know I'm Asian.
but I'm in a very white school.

501
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.782
It kind of was nice to be connected
to that Asian side of myself.

502
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:22.409
I didn't have a boyfriend.

503
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.494
<i>so then it's nice to read
about boyfriends.</i>

504
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:27.789
Yeah. and a lot of them are drawn
and written by women too.

505
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:30.834
<i>There was a lot of stories told
from a girl's point of view.</i>

506
00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:32.293
<i>and they're the heroes.</i>

507
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:37.424
they save the day
or they change the hearts of all the boys

508
00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:39.718
and make them fall for her.

509
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:42.887
This is my house.
This is my boyfriend. Darren.

510
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:49.519
My many game consoles.

511
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:53.857
I've been using these
to de-stress over quarantine.

512
00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:59.487
This is this awesome
Miyazaki art book I got

513
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.614
about the Ghibli Museum.

514
00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:03.700
I got this rug over quarantine.

515
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.035
Diane really likes this rug.

516
00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.912
Where's Diane? Diane?

517
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.206
Don't be scared. don't be scared.

518
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.041
Don't be scared. Come over here.

519
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.293
I got you!

520
00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:15.336
She'll come out. she's shy.

521
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.089
I think I'm craving even more speed

522
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:21.885
as she poofs into a panda
and shoots forward.

523
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:25.346
<i>We're paying homage to anime
throughout the entire movie.</i>

524
00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:29.350
<i>You can see it in the expressions
and the acting.</i>

525
00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.144
<i>the starry eyes in Mei</i>

526
00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:33.938
<i>when she sees a boy
that she really. really loves.</i>

527
00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.149
Uh. Mei?

528
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:38.109
Why are you staring
- at Carter Murphy-
- Mayhew?

529
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:40.820
We definitely have a lot of expertise
on the movie

530
00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.782
about being 13-year-old girls.
for sure.

531
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.910
There is definitely
a lived experience there

532
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.995
that we get to bring
to the movie-making.

533
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.747
maybe in a different way

534
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:54.334
than I would have been able to.
say on a movie like <i>WALL•E.</i>

535
00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:58.880
<i>That scene with Mei
going under the bed.</i>

536
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.257
and all of a sudden
she's sort of gripped by things.

537
00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:05.220
and she's drawing these sexy pictures
and the conflict there

538
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.222
<i>and "Why did I draw those things?"</i>

539
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:09.641
<i>I mean. I wasn't
under my bed drawing things.</i>

540
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.561
<i>but when I was 11.
I had a little wooden clothes pin.</i>

541
00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:17.065
<i>and I had this mad crush on this woman
that was older than me.</i>

542
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:20.568
<i>but I did not know
that I was gay at the time.</i>

543
00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:23.071
<i>And I remember drawing her name</i>

544
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:25.657
<i>on the clothes pin
and then flipping it over.</i>

545
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:28.827
<i>And she played a sport
so I put her number down.</i>

546
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.746
<i>and that sat on my desk
and I would look at it sometimes.</i>

547
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.165
<i>You know. these things.
these silly things you do.</i>

548
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:37.085
I definitely get what Mei is doing.

549
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.339
From the side. would it look like this?

550
00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:44.759
Did you know that I was like.
"Oh. my God. am I ready?"

551
00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.470
- To be a production designer?
- Yeah. "Will I be good?"

552
00:30:47.554 --> 00:30:52.183
<i>We both did it on a short.
But you're a first time feature...</i>

553
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:54.727
<i>I will be a first-time
feature production designer.</i>

554
00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:58.606
I figured because I was nervous
about directing for the first time

555
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.317
that you would be nervous
about production designing.

556
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.570
but I naively thought.

557
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.364
"How much harder could it be
directing a feature?"

558
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.411
I was really scared. honestly.
at the beginning.

559
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:14.038
I mean. you know.
Domee was intimidating. right?

560
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:17.625
I mean. she's... Seriously. you were.
like. super talented and...

561
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:18.710
I'm gonna be a diva.

562
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.461
No. I was never worried about that.

563
00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.546
It was good. too.

564
00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:24.716
because you also made me.
kind of having done this for a while.

565
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.468
you questioned things
that I hadn't questioned in a while.

566
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:35.101
<i>So I started in May of '97
at Pixar on</i> A Bug's Life.

567
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:37.061
<i>I had worked in traditional animation.</i>

568
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:40.148
but at the time. CG animation
was a completely different ball game.

569
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.736
<i>I just remember I would have this notepad
and I would just write down questions.</i>

570
00:31:45.194 --> 00:31:47.196
<i>I was like. "Is the render farm a zoo?</i>

571
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.907
"What's a cookie?
Can I have a cookie?"

572
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:51.743
They're like. "No. You cannot."
A cookie is not a cookie.

573
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:55.246
It was kind of like.
"Here we go. welcome to my questions."

574
00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:58.708
<i>Danielle was definitely
somebody that I sought out.</i>

575
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:02.378
as she would not judge you and give you
a nice. clear and concise answer.

576
00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:05.548
When we export act three.

577
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:09.135
is there a way to do one
that just has music...

578
00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:11.721
<i>One of the things
I love most about Pixar</i>

579
00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.932
is that I'm still asking questions

580
00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:19.604
with the same amount of freedom and safety
as I did on the first day I got here.

581
00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.689
<i>It's just a philosophy that I've kept.</i>

582
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.318
<i>It's something I encourage other people
to do as they're starting on something.</i>

583
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.402
<i>If you don't know.</i>

584
00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.614
you're probably not the only one
in the room who doesn't know. so ask.

585
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.658
We basically started these this morning.

586
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:34.243
So be gentle.

587
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:39.707
<i>A little bit before I was asked
to be the DP on</i> WALL•E.

588
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:42.669
I thought. "I don't know
if I could ever be a DP.

589
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:44.879
"maybe like in 10 or 15 years."

590
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.255
Wow. that's great.

591
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.759
This one we lit in five minutes.

592
00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:53.137
<i>And then Andrew Stanton
asked me to be the DP on</i> WALL•E.

593
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:57.141
<i>and I was terrified because I didn't think
I knew how to do that at all.</i>

594
00:32:57.725 --> 00:33:00.770
<i>I think we both
credit Andrew to a big degree. frankly.</i>

595
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:06.025
We both had this encouragement
neither one of us would have asked for

596
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:09.237
until he kind of said.
"No. I want you to come do this."

597
00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.780
It was an amazing experience.

598
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.658
It was also. half the time. terrifying

599
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:17.829
<i>of just trying to figure out
how to hang on to who I was</i>

600
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.080
and make it through.

601
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.375
even though a lot of times I felt like
I didn't know what I was doing.

602
00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.338
<i>But what we then decided to do</i>

603
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:29.590
<i>is some look stuff that's sort of like.</i>

604
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:33.344
<i>"How do we get out of the Pixar look?
How do we get into some new thing?"</i>

605
00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:37.473
We were trying to push
the boundaries of style

606
00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:39.559
<i>in both storytelling. in the camera.</i>

607
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.144
<i>the look of things.</i>

608
00:33:41.144 --> 00:33:43.521
<i>using some hand-drawn elements.</i>

609
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:47.066
<i>but then you sprinkle in
Asian art influences.</i>

610
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.736
It's been so interesting
to take those pieces

611
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:53.698
and figure out how you can apply them
to a 3D computer-animated film.

612
00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:59.203
<i>For me. I really wanted to be
a VFX supervisor</i>

613
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.956
<i>that was making sure
that people had the room</i>

614
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.833
<i>to bring their very best.</i>

615
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.293
<i>Not telling people what to do</i>

616
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.545
but making space for them to shine.

617
00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.923
<i>And I have to say. honestly.
a lot of that has started with Rona</i>

618
00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:14.302
<i>because she is the most
collaborative production designer</i>

619
00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:16.471
<i>I have ever worked with. far and away.</i>

620
00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.182
I think it's made
a huge difference to the movie

621
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:21.601
and to people's enjoyment
of making the movie.

622
00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:26.481
And this is the trust
and the confidence I gain.

623
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:30.610
This isn't just our first concert.

624
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:34.197
This is our first step into womanhood.

625
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:37.033
And we have to do it together.

626
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:41.537
<i>Mei's friends are
Miriam. Abby. and Priya.</i>

627
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.289
And they're her dork squad.

628
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.043
<i>They accept her no matter what.</i>

629
00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:48.711
<i>Red panda or no panda.</i>

630
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:52.924
<i>I always saw that as a metaphor
for when I found my squad.</i>

631
00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.884
<i>4*TOWN. here we come!</i>

632
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.138
I love that Mei
has these key friendships.

633
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.432
<i>I very much am that person myself.</i>

634
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:06.312
<i>I always was the kid who had
two or three best friends.</i>

635
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:09.690
<i>Those kind of quirky. dorky people
who made you laugh.</i>

636
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.027
<i>equally insecure
about what was going on.</i>

637
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.988
<i>And in high school.
we'd get invited to the party</i>

638
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:17.406
<i>and we'd be like. "Okay. cool."</i>

639
00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:22.161
<i>And then we drive over to the party
and we'd sit outside for a minute.</i>

640
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:24.872
<i>and then we were like.
"Let's go get a cake."</i>

641
00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:30.545
<i>Then we'd eat a cake. like a whole cake.
in the car. and then go home.</i>

642
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.299
It was about friends
that listen to that moment

643
00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:37.552
when you were like.
"I'm not comfortable going in.

644
00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.178
"I'm not confident enough
to do this.

645
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.848
"and all I really want to do
is go hang out with you guys."

646
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.726
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

647
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:49.438
<i>Figuring out
how to be comfortable in the room</i>

648
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:51.482
<i>and finding my voice took a while.</i>

649
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.069
<i>When I first started.
I was definitely more nervous.</i>

650
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:59.115
<i>I was one of the few women
in the story department.</i>

651
00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:01.367
<i>What helped a lot for me</i>

652
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.703
<i>was a female story artists support group</i>

653
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.746
called the Story Artistas.

654
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.125
<i>led by Mary Coleman.
and Nicole Grindle.</i>

655
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.128
They were like.
"I want you guys to get comfortable."

656
00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:14.589
like. stating out loud
what your goals are.

657
00:36:15.047 --> 00:36:18.092
And I think there was one lunch
where I meekly said out loud.

658
00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:21.679
"I want to be a director." Oh!

659
00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.307
Cool. Yeah. really feeling that anger.

660
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:27.393
She's like launching herself up.
"Sorry. I'm not..."

661
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.605
You could play Ming
a little bit more in slo-mo as well.

662
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.607
- Yeah.
- Otherwise it's looking good.

663
00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:34.942
Anyone else have thoughts? Notes?

664
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.277
- Mei-
- Mei. there you are.

665
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.945
- Hey. Mom...
- You're ten minutes late.

666
00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.364
What happened? Are you hurt?
Are you hungry?

667
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:44.577
- Um...
- Ming is a force to be reckoned with.

668
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:48.289
She's just a sweet innocent child.

669
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.541
How dare you take advantage of her!

670
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:54.003
When Sandra Oh became the voice of Ming.

671
00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:57.924
<i>it just felt like her character
was starting to flesh out.</i>

672
00:36:57.924 --> 00:36:59.967
I knew you were trouble.

673
00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:03.638
<i>Sandra's so funny.
but she also has so much range.</i>

674
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:07.600
She added that missing piece
to the puzzle of Ming.

675
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.020
I have a double-jointed elbow!
Look! I can make a perfect circle!

676
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.521
That was great.

677
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.357
I think in terms of design.

678
00:37:14.357 --> 00:37:17.526
<i>you wanted her to have
the really powerful shoulders</i>

679
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.903
<i>with these thin eyebrows.</i>

680
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.447
<i>kind of like Chinese ladies
from like the '60s.</i>

681
00:37:21.447 --> 00:37:24.992
<i>- with the qipao and stuff.
- I wanted traditional Chinese</i>

682
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.411
<i>mixed with</i> Working Girl. <i>Yeah.</i>

683
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:37.338
We definitely couldn't have written Ming
without input from Lindsey

684
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:40.132
and other moms on the show.

685
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:47.348
I came at it purely from the point of view
of the oppressed teenage daughter.

686
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:51.435
<i>So it was really helpful
hearing that other side.</i>

687
00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:54.522
You don't know everything.
you're making it up as you go along.

688
00:37:55.106 --> 00:38:00.236
<i>What I love about Ming is that she's not
one sided. cookie cutter character</i>

689
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:01.862
<i>and certainly not as a mom.</i>

690
00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:05.741
And as a mom myself.
I can appreciate those moments.

691
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.451
Hey. Sloane?

692
00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:12.873
So will you remind me before we sit down
to dinner to RSVP for your...

693
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.959
Fall festival?
Yeah.

694
00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:18.879
<i>You're having conversations
that you are like.</i>

695
00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:21.173
<i>"Is this even the right conversation
to be having?</i>

696
00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:23.384
<i>"Am I supposed to be playing
more of a mom role?</i>

697
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:24.844
<i>"I don't even know what that is."</i>

698
00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:31.600
<i>You're talking about heartbreak and dating
and insecurity and body image.</i>

699
00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:33.561
<i>I know how I feel about all those things.</i>

700
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.314
<i>yet I don't know what I'm supposed
to say about any of them.</i>

701
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:39.317
I don't know if I'm supposed
to pretend I don't have those issues

702
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.694
or if I'm supposed to say
I had all of them.

703
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:45.406
<i>We always joke that your poor oldest kid
is like the first pancake.</i>

704
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.907
You're like "Oof.

705
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.452
"Sorry. dude. I'm pretty sure
we're messing this up."

706
00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:51.245
The third one we should be good.

707
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:53.581
She's gonna have
nothing to complain about

708
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:54.790
You guys...

709
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.668
The RSVP thing is closed.

710
00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.170
Mom!

711
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.379
Okay.
Is it too late?

712
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:02.256
Yeah. apparently. But that's okay.

713
00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:04.175
Ready?
Yeah.

714
00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:11.307
<i>In a way. parenting overwhelms me
much more than my job does.</i>

715
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:17.396
And I think it's just because I feel like
the stakes are so much higher.

716
00:39:19.482 --> 00:39:21.984
<i>Every choice you make as a parent</i>

717
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:24.779
<i>has equal chances
of being this great memory</i>

718
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.031
<i>and a success
in your relationship with them.</i>

719
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:30.034
<i>or alternatively. this huge disaster</i>

720
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:32.745
<i>that they will talk about
for the rest of their lives</i>

721
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:35.706
<i>as the most embarrassing thing
that ever happened to them.</i>

722
00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:43.381
Okay. Who wants to get dressed?
Me!

723
00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:51.430
<i>We both have worked
very hard at our careers.</i>

724
00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:54.058
<i>and we are late mommies.</i>

725
00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:56.894
<i>And so I think both of us
have a huge amount of regard</i>

726
00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:59.105
<i>for how important our work and career is.</i>

727
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:01.524
<i>and so we try to protect
that for one another.</i>

728
00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:05.236
<i>On Fridays. Paige is here with the kids.
We don't have the nanny.</i>

729
00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.571
<i>And. you know. I sort of have this like.</i>

730
00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:10.616
<i>any spare moment I have
I should be running out to help.</i>

731
00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:13.202
<i>and she has zero expectation of that.</i>

732
00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.871
<i>That's made it so much more doable</i>

733
00:40:15.955 --> 00:40:18.457
<i>to be able to balance the two things.</i>

734
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:22.628
<i>Not that it's always easy or something
but it. that makes a huge difference.</i>

735
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:27.091
Boy. you guys really destroyed
the house this morning.

736
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.637
<i>You know. it's really amazing
those kids right now.</i>

737
00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:33.681
<i>they're almost 17 months.</i>

738
00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:36.225
Maybe you can hear Jack
crying in the other room.

739
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:39.228
<i>That's a little heartbreaking
because I want to go run and help.</i>

740
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:43.482
<i>It is a massive luxury
to be able to see my kids</i>

741
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:46.277
<i>as much as I have
during this last year-plus.</i>

742
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:49.363
<i>I never ever would have
been able to see them as much.</i>

743
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:53.159
<i>I would have been racing home from work
just to catch them going to bed.</i>

744
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:57.037
<i>Sometimes I get to catch them for dinner.
I always get to put them to bed.</i>

745
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.377
You know. it's not like
you can ever get that time back.

746
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.551
Yeah. I think it's working really well.

747
00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:12.511
Okay.
- Final!

748
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:19.685
<i>I think it took until screening six
for us to finally have an ending.</i>

749
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:23.564
<i>And that. I think. was because
it took a long time for me</i>

750
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:26.484
<i>to process my own relationship
with my mother.</i>

751
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:30.988
<i>and just trying to figure out
how to be a good daughter for them.</i>

752
00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:35.993
<i>I also don't know
what the solution is in real life.</i>

753
00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:39.830
<i>Is it about being true to yourself.
or is it about honoring your parents?</i>

754
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:40.998
<i>I don't know.</i>

755
00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:44.877
<i>It's some messy mix of both.
There's no clear answer.</i>

756
00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:49.965
<i>Before I was a mom.</i>

757
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.638
<i>it just didn't occur to me
how hard it would be.</i>

758
00:41:55.638 --> 00:41:59.683
<i>I don't know how people do it. and I don't
even know how I'm doing it right now.</i>

759
00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:08.067
<i>My mom has been such a huge supporter
of what I want to do.</i>

760
00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:12.446
and she just always believed
that I know what's best.

761
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:17.076
That gave me so much freedom
to be the artist that I am today.

762
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.329
Happy baby.

763
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.419
<i>Growing up. my parents separated.</i>

764
00:42:27.503 --> 00:42:31.423
and striving for perfection
came from this feeling of like.

765
00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:37.179
I just want to be good enough
to keep my dad and my mom.

766
00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:38.764
And maybe...

767
00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:42.726
Maybe if I was a perfect little girl.
my parents would be together.

768
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:45.354
Yeah.

769
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.107
And... Hmm!

770
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:51.318
It worked out
in the best possible way for me.

771
00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:55.614
I feel like it made me ambitious.

772
00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:58.867
<i>Ever since I had a baby. my worth.</i>

773
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:02.621
<i>who I am. is no longer
so much tied to others.</i>

774
00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:06.500
I just feel like I am a whole being

775
00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:08.586
and I'm solid.

776
00:43:12.798 --> 00:43:16.552
<i>I think anyone being able
to tell kids as they're</i>

777
00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:18.971
<i>growing up and going through
this sort of chaos.</i>

778
00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:22.016
<i>of emotion or feeling out of control</i>

779
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:23.517
<i>or "Do my parents love me?"</i>

780
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.228
<i>or "Can I be who I want to be
and they'll still love me?"</i>

781
00:43:26.312 --> 00:43:28.814
or "Who am I and what do the other kids
want me to be?"

782
00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:32.526
<i>We need art in general.</i>

783
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.362
<i>especially things that go on a screen
that kids can see</i>

784
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.156
<i>that tell them that it is okay.</i>

785
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:41.744
<i>And I think it's also for parents.
it's okay to see all of that craziness.</i>

786
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:44.622
<i>and that's a natural part of life
you've got to wade through</i>

787
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.123
<i>to form who you really are.</i>

788
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:50.294
Meilin says she's not like her mom.
and that's okay.

789
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.798
<i>And then she realizes.
"I am my own person.</i>

790
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:57.134
<i>"I want to embrace this thing</i>

791
00:43:57.134 --> 00:44:00.512
<i>"that every other member of my family
has tried to lock away."</i>

792
00:44:02.848 --> 00:44:05.142
<i>When she becomes this red panda.</i>

793
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.354
<i>it at first glance. represents everything
she doesn't want to be.</i>

794
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:13.192
<i>her being different and standing out
and feeling like she can't control herself</i>

795
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:15.653
<i>or the situation
the way she used to be able to.</i>

796
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.991
<i>You can't go through life and become the
amazing person you're supposed to become</i>

797
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:24.119
<i>if things don't conspire to rock
that sense of stability.</i>

798
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:26.580
<i>When you say to embrace the red panda.</i>

799
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:30.668
<i>I think that represents
being okay with that part of yourself.</i>

800
00:44:31.251 --> 00:44:33.420
<i>It's okay not to be
in control all the time.</i>

801
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.798
<i>It's okay to be messy.
It's okay to be loud.</i>

802
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.508
<i>It's okay to be noticed.</i>

803
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:41.303
If you don't accept it. it's a curse.

804
00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:46.058
And then if you embrace it.
then it's a gift that keeps on giving.

805
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:50.062
I mean. for Mei. once she embraced it.
her whole life opened up to her.

806
00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:53.607
<i>The last year-plus
with the pandemic</i>

807
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:57.528
<i>has been unlike anything
any of us have experienced.</i>

808
00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.239
<i>It's been incredibly difficult.
it's been very stressful.</i>

809
00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:03.701
and for me. this is the funniest movie
I've ever worked on.

810
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:09.832
and so. if even at just that level
people get to have some laughs.

811
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:11.542
<i>I think that would be amazing.</i>

812
00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:14.044
<i>But it also has this much deeper thing</i>

813
00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:17.297
<i>of really being able to reach out
and say. "It's okay."</i>

814
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:20.634
<i>If you're confused and feeling crazy
and you don't know who you are</i>

815
00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:23.262
<i>and you might let your parents
or yourself down.</i>

816
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:25.222
that's a natural part of growing up.

817
00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:28.559
And if that could be what we provide for.

818
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:32.563
I think even one kid out there.
that would be really amazing.

819
00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:42.698
Come on. Good Cornflake.

820
00:45:45.617 --> 00:45:49.246
Darren made a quiche yesterday.

821
00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:51.707
Look. your quiche is on camera.

822
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:54.251
So cool. I like how you guys designed it.

823
00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.670
In there?
Yes.

824
00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:03.844
When these dogs come in here
and start snoring so loudly.

825
00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:06.388
to the point where they're like...

826
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.735
<i>Do you. Rona. take Dylan
to be your lawfully wedded spouse?</i>

827
00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:20.903
I do.

828
00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:22.821
<i>Congratulations. you may kiss.</i>

829
00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:28.744
Good boy. Got it?

830
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:30.579
Great job.

831
00:46:48.013 --> 00:46:50.474
<i>Final!</i>
