Just in time

Aren'’t they beautiful?

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.278
Just like you. my sweet bun.

7
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:06.283
Hmm?

8
00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:07.502
That'’s odd.

9
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:12.333
Oh. no. They found us.

10
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.381

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:19.427

You are so dead.

55
00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:24.089
Not just mostly dead.
but actually. like.
a hundred percent dead?

56
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.482
He'’s not worth it. man.

This is a walk.
not a run.

59

Anyone ever see his house?

60
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.316
The whole place is covered
with this junk.

61
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.231
Magic charms and incense.

62
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.146
It'’s his crazy grandma'’s.

63
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.930
What is she.
some kind of witch?

64
00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:42.586
Okay. for real. can we leave
my grandma out of this?

65
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.892
Or what?

66
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.853
Say. "My grandma'’s
a crazy witch."

67
00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:51.291
Your grandma'’s a crazy witch?

68
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:54.511
Wait. No. no. no! Your--

69
00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:58.123
This is what you get.
You and your witchy grandma.

70
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.910
I told you.
leave my grandma out of it!

71
00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:05.609
You see that?

72
00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:12.921
You can see his underwear.

73
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.722
What is happening?

74
00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:35.247
Yo! Fight Club!

75
00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:37.859
It'’s okay. It'’s just me.

76
00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:40.731
Yeah. Well.
you snuck up on me.

77
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.124
I'’m Rav.

78
00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:43.430
I'’m Tom.

79
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:45.170
Yeah. you mentioned
that earlier.

80
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.043
right before you threw a dude
into the ceiling. Hello?

81
00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:51.655
You know.
maybe it'’s that protein bar
I had this morning.

82
00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.657
Wow. I gotta
get one of those.

83
00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:56.443
Oh.

84
00:05:56.617 --> 00:05:58.183
- Wait for me?
- Okay.

85
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:02.797
Hi.

86
00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:06.453
I told her I'’d walk home.

87
00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:09.804
Let'’s go. Come on.

88
00:06:09.978 --> 00:06:11.371

- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

95
00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.388
My foster mom.
she loves these things.

96
00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:31.695
My grandma'’s actually
got a whole story about how
they ward off evil spirits.

97
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.958
Okay. stop right there.
Evil spirits?

98
00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:35.830
- Sorry!
- Coming through!

99
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:38.528
You know how grandmas always
tell the craziest stories.

100
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.791
Yeah. actually. I don'’t.

101
00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.838
Oh. I'’m sorry.
I didn'’t mean to... It'’s all good.

the foster jackpot.

is pretty rad.

104
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.322
That'’s cool.

105
00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:53.108
My grandma took me in
when I was super little.

106
00:06:53.282 --> 00:06:54.849
But she'’s great.

107
00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:58.026
You know. she can be--What?
Weird and embarrassing?

108
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.289
Yeah. But she'’s cool too.

109
00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:03.335
I'’d go live
with a cool witch any day.

110
00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.730
Do I have something in my teeth?

111
00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:08.515
Nope. You'’re good.

112
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.038
How '’bout now?

113
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:16.784
Hey. Gigi.

114
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.830
Ooh. is that thing okay?
Should she look like that?

115
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.442
Yeah. yeah. She just. you know.
sleeps with her eyes open.

116
00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:24.226
[Tom] Bye. Gigi!

117
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.402
Your eyes must be so dry. dog.

118
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.581
Please just turn back now.

119
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.496
Once you see it.
you can'’t unsee it.

120
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.499
Oh. come on. Tom.
- I'’m sure it'’s fine.
- Uh-huh.

121
00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:39.197
People beat me up because
of my totally normal house.

122
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.938
It can'’t be that bad.

123
00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:44.333
Oh. dang.

124
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:46.509
A lot of people
leave oranges on our stoop

125
00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:48.685
because they think
our house is a temple.

126
00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:51.122
But on the plus side.
free oranges.

127
00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:54.125
Hey. Tommy!

128
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:57.302
Hey! Who'’s your friend?
She looks so cute.

129
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.609
Oh. Hi. Tom'’s grandma.

130
00:08:00.218 --> 00:08:01.481
Kill me now.

131
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.526
Ah Tom.
you should invite her in.

132
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.746
All right.
I'’ll be right there. Ah Ma!

133
00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:09.053
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

134
00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.720
You know. your parents met
in high school.

135
00:08:23.894 --> 00:08:25.200
Ah Ma. chill.

136
00:08:25.374 --> 00:08:27.115
She'’s just a friend. okay?

137
00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.900
She probably got scared off
anyway by our crazy house.

138
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:31.815
Crazy amazing?

139
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:34.644
At least
she didn'’t see the inside.

140
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:38.343
Tom. even if these charms
seem silly to you.

141
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.737
they are important to me.

142
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.696
I still don'’t even know
what they mean.

143
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.872
You don'’t have to know
to understand.

144
00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.482
Ah Ma. you'’re talking
to me in riddles.

145
00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.005
One day.

146
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.531
you will see yourself
for what you truly are

147
00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.576
and not what you appear to be.

148
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.447
And what does that mean?

149
00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:00.017
We talked about this.

150
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:03.891
Ah Tom. we don'’t use these.

151
00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:06.894
We use this and this.

152
00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.157
We don'’t have to fight.

153
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.942
Besides. you'’re not
too good at it.

154
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.596
The kid called you a witch.

155
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.772
So? Maybe I am a witch.

156
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:17.948
Ha-ha. Very funny.

157
00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:21.473
This bully at school.
he needs your compassion.

158
00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:23.127
What? Why?

159
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:26.783
Because he himself
was probably hurt
at some point.

160
00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:29.699
People are
inherently good. Tom.

161
00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:32.006
Our family has always
believed this.

162
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.443
What family?
It'’s just you and me.

163
00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:37.925
Your lineage goes back
a thousand generations.

164
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:40.188
Our traditions
live on in you.

165
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:43.974
Yeah. well. maybe we could try
being a little less traditional
for once.

166
00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:46.411
Obviously.
I'’m proud of it
or whatever.

167
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.543
"Or whatever"?

168
00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:52.896
I just wanna be normal.

169
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.552
Ah Tom. you are not normal.

170
00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.685
Great. Thanks.

171
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:04.342
Our entire family
is very not normal.

172
00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:08.608
I'’ve been waiting to talk to you
about this for a long time.

173
00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:12.524
But first. you must
put the charms back up.

174
00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:13.961
And then. we'’ll talk.

175
00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:15.658
Okay. Grandma.

176
00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:19.357
Hurry up!

177
00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.931
You can'’t just
put them up like that.

178
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.282
Whoa. dude!

179
00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:32.980
There'’s a system.

180
00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.722
Who are you?

181
00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:37.767
How long were
the protective charms down?

182
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:39.682
Like. for five minutes. okay?

183
00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.379
- Do I know you. man?
- No.

184
00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:42.642
But I know you.

185
00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:44.469
Whoa! Ew! Are you sniffing me?

186
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.210
Yeah. And you reek. kid.

187
00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:48.082
No. I don'’t.

188
00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:50.475
Where'’s your grandmother?
Mrs. Lee. are you okay?

189
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.477
Dude. Okay.

190
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.654
Keep your shoes on.
That'’s not rude at all.

191
00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:57.439
There we go.
So you have tracking mud
and all that stuff. okay.

192
00:10:57.613 --> 00:10:59.659
-  Hu!
- Mei Ling.

193
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.879
It'’s so good to see you.

194
00:11:03.053 --> 00:11:05.708
No pinching necessary.
all right?
We spoke about this.

195
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:08.972
Tom. this is Hu.
my old friend.

196
00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:10.452
An old friend?

197
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.193
Like. what kind of friend
are we talking here?

198
00:11:12.367 --> 00:11:14.717
Platonic. hopefully.

199
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:16.632
Ugh. there'’s no time
for this.

200
00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:19.069
I picked up the scent of <i>fashu</i>
at the boy'’s school today.

201
00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:20.244
Magic?

202
00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:22.029
I know. I felt it too.

203
00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:23.944
He stinks of it.
You could be in danger.

204
00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:25.249
Calm down.

205
00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:27.208
We were just about
to have "the talk."

206
00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:31.212
Ew. Ah Ma. no.
I don'’t need the talk.
I'’m 15.

207
00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:35.172
So the charms are down.
the kid still doesn'’t know
who he is.

208
00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:38.741
and none of the Zodiacs
have been following
any of my protocols.

209
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:42.919
Tom. your fight today.
What exactly happened?

210
00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:45.617
I mean. this kid.
he got all mad at me.

211
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:49.273
Huge guy. you know?
Shoulders all puffed out.
Kinda like you actually.

212
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:51.014
Cut to the chase.

213
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:54.148
It wasn'’t me.
This kid. he started it.

214
00:11:54.322 --> 00:11:56.280
- Did you finish it?
- What?

215
00:11:56.454 --> 00:11:58.021
Did anything strange happen?

216
00:11:58.195 --> 00:11:59.893
Yeah-- No. not really.

217
00:12:00.067 --> 00:12:03.592
Other than
when I threw him
into the ceiling.

218
00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:05.246
Oh. boy.

219
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.856
Wait. Nobody saw you. right?

220
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.730
No. no. not really.
Just about a hundred kids or so.

221
00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:12.688
Oh. we gotta
get out of here.

222
00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:14.821
Grandma. who is this guy?

223
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:17.084
"This guy"?

224
00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:19.042
I'’m a Warrior
of the Circle of Twelve.

225
00:12:19.216 --> 00:12:21.349
sworn to protect
the Guardian of the Phoenix.

226
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:24.091
Ah Ma. like
from the kids'’ stories?

227
00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:25.570
I'’m a Zodiac.

228
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.356
Okay. Hi.
I'’m Tom. House of Lee.

229
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.881
Lactose-intolerant and guardian
of a Steph Curry rookie card.

230
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:32.969
"Kids'’ stories"?

231
00:12:33.143 --> 00:12:34.797
I wanted to give him time.

232
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:36.799
Time for what?

233
00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:40.063
Seriously? Guys! Hello!
I'’m right here.

234
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:41.630
We know. kid.
We know you'’re here.

235
00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:43.066
Dude. what is your problem?

236
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.373
Everybody knows you'’re here!

237
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:47.592
Does anything you say
make sense?

238
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.073
Everything I say makes sense.

239
00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:52.772
Something'’s here.

240
00:12:52.946 --> 00:12:55.296
- Whoa! Whoa. whoa. earthquake!
- Nope.

241
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.863
Put on your shoes. Tom.

242
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.778
How did you do that?

243
00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:03.783
Whoa.

244
00:13:04.609 --> 00:13:06.263
Ah!

245
00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:08.396
- Ah Ma.
- Oh. yeah!

246
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.180
I'’ll cover the front.
you get the back.

247
00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:12.313
No. This is powerful <i>fashu.</i>

248
00:13:12.487 --> 00:13:14.054
You and Tom need to go.

249
00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:15.490
What? No!

250
00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:17.753
Get him to safety.
He needs you. Hu.

251
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.626
Tom. Tom. look at me.

252
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.454
I promise
I'’ll explain everything.

253
00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:25.717
but right now
you have to go with Hu.

254
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:27.110
I'’m not leaving you.

255
00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.767
- Loo.
- Go! Now!

256
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.160
No. wait--Go!

257
00:13:34.944 --> 00:13:35.945
Whoa!

258
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.513
Mrs. Lee.

259
00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:41.908
Loo.

260
00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:44.867
We can make this easy.

261
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.217
You know what I want. old woman.

262
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:49.524
Then come and get it.

263
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:51.743
Go!

264
00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:53.267
Bring me the Phoenix.

265
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:05.061
How precious.

266
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.111
Grandma!

267
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.115
Whoa. Whoa.

268
00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:18.379
Oh. whoa! No. no. no. no. no!

269
00:14:19.423 --> 00:14:20.642
Back off!

270
00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:28.171
Huh?

271
00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:33.785
Oh. I really missed doing that.

272
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.005
What happened to your pants?

273
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:38.355
Oh. great. More <i>yaoguai.</i>

274
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:40.792
What the heck is a <i>yao--</i>

275
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.452
No Zodiac Warriors
to protect you now.

276
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:50.454
Just you and me.

277
00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:55.329
Unless you prefer I start
with your darling grandson.

278
00:14:55.503 --> 00:14:57.026
Stay away from him!

279
00:15:11.475 --> 00:15:14.000
Come on! Come on!
Giddyap. tiger!

280
00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:16.437
Say that again.
and I will eat you.

281
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.657
No. no. no. no.
Wait. wait. wait!
Hold on!

282
00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:29.232
No. no. no! Oh. my gosh!

283
00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:31.234
No. no. no! Get off my--

284
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.411
Ow! Watch what you'’re kicking.

285
00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:36.152
Oh!

286
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:43.072
Tiger! Tiger. help!

287
00:15:56.868 --> 00:15:59.828
Look at you. so fragile now.

288
00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:02.135
So old.

289
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:04.093
Do you need a hand?

290
00:16:08.315 --> 00:16:09.751
I'’ll give you two!

291
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.898
Right on a used diaper.[Tom] Ah Ma!

292
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.948
Ah Ma!

293
00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:35.777
Ah Tom. are you okay?

294
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.739
You think
I'’m so easily defeated?

295
00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:43.524
I'’ll take that.

296
00:16:43.698 --> 00:16:45.047
No! Let her go!

297
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:49.182
Not while I'’m Guardian!

298
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.684
Ah Ma.

299
00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:21.040
What?

300
00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:22.911
What is that?

301
00:17:23.694 --> 00:17:25.261
The Ghost Cart.

302
00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:28.134
Comes to carry away the souls
of the great and the noble.

303
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:40.320
Ah Ma!

304
00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.087
Come on. kid. Keep up.

305
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.011
Quick. inside.

306
00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:32.676
I have to alert the others.

307
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.898
What good is that gonna do?
No. No. we need to...

308
00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:39.466
- Why are we in a junk shop?
- Antique shop.

309
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.858
Not junk.

310
00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:42.251
I live here.

311
00:18:42.425 --> 00:18:44.035
I'’ve been here
watching over you.

312
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.776
You and those monsters--

313
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.085
<i>Yaoguai.</i> Loo'’s creatures.
Vicious little creatures.

314
00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:53.349
They were just crazy stories
my grandma told me
when I was little.

315
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:55.351
Well. they'’re not stories. okay?

316
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:57.658
Not stories. kid.

317
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.965
Your grandmother
was a Guardian. Tom.

318
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.358
One of the best.

319
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.882
She gave her life
to protect that.

320
00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:06.580
Her necklace?

321
00:19:06.754 --> 00:19:08.495
It'’s the Phoenix.

322
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.976
Ever since goddess Nu Kua
used the Phoenix
to create humanity.

323
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.501
dark forces have been trying
to capture it.

324
00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:17.721
- Whoa.
- Now the duty of
protecting it is yours.

325
00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:20.333
What? That'’s not...

326
00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:23.901
I have to go home.
I have school tomorrow.

327
00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:26.208
And Grandma. she'’s...

328
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.731
You can'’t leave. kid.

329
00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:29.298
It'’s my job.

330
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:34.651
I don'’t even know you. man.

331
00:19:34.825 --> 00:19:38.873
If you'’re a Zodiac Warrior.
I thought your job was
to protect Ah Ma!

332
00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:42.181
Tom--You left her there!
You could'’ve saved her.

333
00:19:42.355 --> 00:19:43.486
Hey.

334
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.749
- I gotta get out of here.
- Stop. No. no.

335
00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:47.360
- You can'’t go-- Wait.
- Get off of me!

336
00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.275
No. no. no.
You need to know about...

337
00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:54.323
...the exit spell
on the door.

338
00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.848
Mrs. Lee put you in my care.

339
00:19:58.022 --> 00:20:00.677
That makes you my apprentice.

340
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:03.593
There'’s a room upstairs.
Why don'’t you take it?

341
00:20:04.551 --> 00:20:05.552
Fine.

342
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:08.511
Dumb tiger.

343
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.742
This can'’t be happening.

344
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.225
Just a junky necklace.

345
00:20:32.448 --> 00:20:33.493
Whoa!

346
00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:34.842
Come on!

347
00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:05.264
Who dares wake
the Empress Nu Kua?

348
00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:08.484
Um. Tom?

349
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:11.705
Oh. it'’s you.

350
00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:15.012
You walk two worlds now--

351
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:18.538
the mortal world
and the world of magic.

352
00:21:24.892 --> 00:21:26.023
Okay.

353
00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:28.896
I really am losing it.

354
00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:13.897
I thought
she was gonna be okay.

355
00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:20.339
I'’m sorry. kid.

356
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:35.441
I don'’t know what they put
in incense these days.

357
00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:38.574
but it really
irritates my eyes.

358
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:41.360
Yeah.

359
00:22:43.013 --> 00:22:44.363
Yeah. me too.

360
00:23:09.344 --> 00:23:11.912
Psst. Hey. Tom?

361
00:23:12.608 --> 00:23:14.436
Tom. Kid!

362
00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.183
Wake up already!

363
00:23:22.357 --> 00:23:24.141
Ow. Cut your nails.

364
00:23:31.192 --> 00:23:33.890
What the heck?
Is that how you wake people up?

365
00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:36.415
Well. next time
I'’ll sing you a song.

366
00:23:36.589 --> 00:23:38.852
Now. come on.
Time to get to work.

367
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:41.942
Work? I don'’t know what
you'’re thinking with all
this apprentice stuff.

368
00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:45.206
but I'’m not waxing cars
for you. man. Whoa.

369
00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:48.601
I know it'’s cool. Come on.

370
00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:51.604
I need to see
what I'’m working with.

371
00:23:51.778 --> 00:23:54.084
- Try to hit me.
- What? For real?

372
00:23:54.258 --> 00:23:57.697
Unless you don'’t think
you'’re up for it.

373
00:23:57.871 --> 00:24:00.569
Oh. it'’s on. fur face!

374
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:06.053
You'’ll have to do
better than that.

375
00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:08.708
You think a <i>yaoguai</i>
is just gonna stand there
and wait for you?

376
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.895
So. I can'’t hit you.

377
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.114
Is that the big point
you'’re trying to make?

378
00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:28.031
No. The point is.
you'’re missing the point.

379
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:30.817
Exactly how many times
did you try to strike me
just now?

380
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:32.253
I don'’t know.

381
00:24:32.427 --> 00:24:33.428
Eight.

382
00:24:33.602 --> 00:24:34.995
And how many times
did you check

383
00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:37.127
to make sure that
the Phoenix was still with you?

384
00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:40.000
Not once.

385
00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:42.045
That'’s the point
I'’m trying to make.

386
00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:45.179
Rat!

387
00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:48.051
I told you to stay
out of my wallet!

388
00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:49.575
Get over here!

389
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.578
No. no. no. no.
that thing'’s ex--

390
00:24:52.752 --> 00:24:54.797
You'’re gonna pay for that!

391
00:24:54.971 --> 00:24:56.886
That'’s what you get!

392
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.148
How many years of--

393
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.587
Stop stealing my stuff!

394
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.502
Hi there!

395
00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:08.811
Oh. my gosh!
Did you see that? I did it!

396
00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:11.335
The thing!
I did the thing.
the bow. bow. bow!

397
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.600
Don'’t get cocky.
That was a defensive <i>fashu.</i>

398
00:25:14.774 --> 00:25:16.210
It'’s reflex.

399
00:25:16.384 --> 00:25:18.212
Tom. this is Rat.

400
00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:20.475
Wait. He'’s a Zodiac.

401
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:21.694
He'’s like you.

402
00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:23.870
Are you trying to insult me?

403
00:25:24.044 --> 00:25:26.873
Sidney'’s my name.
Acquisitions is my game.

404
00:25:29.223 --> 00:25:30.790
Acquisitions?

405
00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:32.487
- You'’re a thief.
- Thief?

406
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.489
You stole
my Ming dynasty sword.

407
00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:37.710
Make sure he didn'’t
- steal your watch.
- I don'’t have a watch.

408
00:25:37.884 --> 00:25:41.191
No problem.
I got a bunch. Want one?
I'’ll give you friend prices.

409
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:42.628
Sidney.
what are you doing here?

410
00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:44.020
Oh.

411
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:46.414
And we'’re going
with rat again. Okay.

412
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:49.722
Hu. that'’s what
I came to tell you.
I saw Loo last night.

413
00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:50.766
- What?
- What?

414
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.333
Sid. that'’s not possible.

415
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:53.943
We saw her die.

416
00:25:54.117 --> 00:25:56.816
I was out wandering around
the old high-rent district

417
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.208
by the sea cliffs.

418
00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:00.602
<i>They got
the most exquisite trash.</i>

419
00:26:00.776 --> 00:26:04.127
<i>I found a primo clam chowder
in the gutter.</i>

420
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:07.435
<i>And then. out of nowhere.
there'’s Loo!</i>

421
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:10.046
<i>It was at this
abandoned mansion.
and I thought.</i>

422
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.310
<i>"Now. is she here
for the clam chowder too?"</i>

423
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:16.444
<i>She looked disgusting.</i>

424
00:26:16.618 --> 00:26:18.272
<i>And I don'’t just throw
that word around.</i>

425
00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:20.622
<i>She crawled
into this creepy fountain.</i>

426
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:25.018
<i>and the water. Hu.
it healed her!</i>

427
00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:27.411
<i>Obviously.
I came straight here.</i>

428
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:33.287
I know that place.
What are we waiting for?
Let'’s go get her.

429
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.071
- What? No!
- Why not?

430
00:26:35.245 --> 00:26:36.856
Because you'’re gonna
get yourself killed.

431
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.988
Loo isn'’t
just another <i>yaoguai.</i>

432
00:26:39.162 --> 00:26:41.077
She'’s as powerful
as a Guardian.

433
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:43.079
She can access
the darkest magic.

434
00:26:43.253 --> 00:26:45.560
We should go to the temple
and get the rest of the Zodiacs.

435
00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:48.824
Exactly! Let'’s do that.
Team Zodiac assemble!

436
00:26:48.998 --> 00:26:50.391
I work better alone.

437
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:52.393
Come on. Hu.
You know it'’ll
be safer for him

438
00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:54.047
with all of us together.

439
00:26:57.833 --> 00:26:59.705
Fine.
We'’ll go get the Zodiacs.

440
00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:01.010
- Yes!
- Yes!

441
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:02.621
I already regret this.

442
00:27:04.927 --> 00:27:06.363
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hey.

443
00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:08.409
Got a little
new Guardian gift for ya.

444
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:10.411
Whoops! That'’s not it!

445
00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:13.283
Found that on the bus.
so you know it'’s good.

446
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.590
You might need this.

447
00:27:15.764 --> 00:27:18.854
Now. remember.
you didn'’t get this from me.

448
00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:24.381
Whoa.

449
00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:26.514
Is that Ming dynasty?

450
00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:28.647
Sweet!

451
00:27:30.344 --> 00:27:33.739
Chinatown is the most
delicious place in the world!

452
00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:35.741
Excuse me.

453
00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:40.528
Oh. Mmm.

454
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:41.964
Do you smell that?

455
00:27:42.138 --> 00:27:43.966
Rotting fish.
splattered soy sauce.

456
00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:47.927
Rude!

457
00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:51.278
Is that moldy ginseng?

458
00:27:51.452 --> 00:27:54.063
Dumplings!
Can you believe someone
threw these out?

459
00:27:54.237 --> 00:27:55.151
Come on. Rat.

460
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:58.024
Yes!

461
00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:02.202
- There it is.
- Wait. we'’re getting dim sum?

462
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.683
Not everything
is what it seems. kid.

463
00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:09.209
It'’s only one of them.

464
00:28:09.383 --> 00:28:10.427
I'’m pretty sure
I can handle--

465
00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:15.519
- Crap.
- Not everything is
what it seems. right?

466
00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:18.131
Oh. yeah.

467
00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:20.437
Mess with the Tiger.
you get the claws.

468
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:22.613
- What? That'’s not a thing.
- Yes. it is.

469
00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:25.225
No. it isn'’t.
- No one says that.
- Tigers do.

470
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:32.449
Whoa.

471
00:28:32.623 --> 00:28:33.929
Oh. you!

472
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:39.413
What?

473
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:42.764
Ah. Come on. Let'’s do this!

474
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.332
Show-off.

475
00:28:48.378 --> 00:28:49.902
Yeah. yeah. you can fly.

476
00:29:00.956 --> 00:29:02.915
Yo! That was incredible!

477
00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:04.481
Gentlemen.

478
00:29:04.655 --> 00:29:05.787
Mistral.

479
00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:07.789
I was doing just fine
without you.

480
00:29:07.963 --> 00:29:09.269
Yes. I saw.

481
00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:10.879
It'’s good to see you. rodent.

482
00:29:11.053 --> 00:29:12.794
She called me "rodent."

483
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:14.535
Thomas Lee.

484
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:17.973
It will be my honor
to protect you and guide you.

485
00:29:18.147 --> 00:29:20.802
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!
Mrs. Lee entrusted him to me.

486
00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:23.805
So I'’ll be the one
watching over
and guiding him.

487
00:29:23.979 --> 00:29:27.809
Oh. Like you guided him
into this trap?

488
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:29.680
Okay. look.
I'’m taking the kid
to the temple.

489
00:29:29.855 --> 00:29:31.639
Good idea.

490
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:34.642
You can probably
find him a master there
with fewer trust issues.

491
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.600
You know what?
Nobody asked you.

492
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.602
Asked me what? To save you?

493
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:41.170
You'’re welcome.
by the way.

494
00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:42.911
Dragon just can'’t
help herself. can she?

495
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:46.175
Oh. same old Hu.

496
00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:49.918
What'’s the saying
about the tiger and his stripes?

497
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.354
You'’re hysterical.

498
00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:52.573
I know.

499
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.274
- Hmm?
- Cynthia!

500
00:29:58.448 --> 00:30:00.494
- We are closed.
- What?

501
00:30:00.668 --> 00:30:04.585
- Ooh.
- Tell me more about how
you have all this handled.

502
00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:06.717
Cynthia. it'’s me. Tiger.

503
00:30:06.892 --> 00:30:08.284
It'’s Hu.

504
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.243
Open the door.

505
00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:11.810
You'’re embarrassing me
out here.

506
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:12.898
Closed!

507
00:30:13.072 --> 00:30:14.421
This is Zodiac business.

508
00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:17.206
And this is
dim sum business.

509
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.775
And we open in three hours.

510
00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:21.907
Nicely done.

511
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:23.169
Does anybody like you?

512
00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:25.127
- I know how to deal with this.
- Mmm.

513
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:29.566
In exchange for entry.
I offer you this 65-year-old
wild ginseng.

514
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.656
Hey. Rat.
no more stealing soy sauce.

515
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.964
Are you sure
you'’re not confusing me
with another talking rat?

516
00:30:36.138 --> 00:30:37.531
- Will a hundred bucks do?
- Oh!

517
00:30:37.705 --> 00:30:39.228
We just opened! Come in.

518
00:30:39.402 --> 00:30:41.230
-  Not a word.
- You'’re welcome.

519
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.887
Oh. that smells so good.
Could we. like. stop
and get a char siu bao?

520
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.236
Nope.[Mistral] Forgive Hu.

521
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.716
He doesn'’t
understand humans.

522
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.805
Or feelings.
Or the modern world.

523
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:54.156
Or much of anything.
to tell you the truth.

524
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.247
Boy reeks like armpits
and new magic. Who is he?

525
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:00.554
- He'’s under my protection.
- Our protection.

526
00:31:00.728 --> 00:31:02.730
Zodiacs.

527
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:04.732
Hmm. so what'’s
going on here?

528
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:07.169
The Temple of the Twelve
is inside a freezer? Really?

529
00:31:28.016 --> 00:31:29.278
It'’s been a minute.

530
00:31:47.993 --> 00:31:50.169
Hey. thanks for the bun.

531
00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:52.736
You needed it. Too skinny!

532
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:57.611
Oh. She'’s a frog.

533
00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:02.094
Whoa.

534
00:32:02.268 --> 00:32:06.228
Welcome to
the Temple of the Twelve.

535
00:32:06.402 --> 00:32:09.884
Ooh. So this is like
your magical fortress?

536
00:32:10.058 --> 00:32:12.104
You ain'’t
seen nothing yet.

537
00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:21.548
And now. introducing
our starting lineup.

538
00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:23.419
What are we.
a basketball team?

539
00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:25.160
Let Rat do his thing.

540
00:32:25.334 --> 00:32:27.032
Presenting the amazing.

541
00:32:27.206 --> 00:32:32.472
the astonishing Zodiac Warriors!

542
00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:37.825
First up.
here is your wake-up call
from Mr. Early Bird himself...

543
00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:40.654
...Rooster!

544
00:32:40.828 --> 00:32:42.525
Feathers of fury!

545
00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:43.657
Whoa.

546
00:32:43.831 --> 00:32:45.789
Pawing his way into your heart.

547
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.749
you gotta love him.
stinky breath and all.

548
00:32:48.923 --> 00:32:49.837
Dog!

549
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:51.970
Slobber tsunami!

550
00:32:52.144 --> 00:32:55.582
Next is the big guy.
all muscle and tussle.

551
00:32:55.756 --> 00:32:58.541
the unstoppable Ox!

552
00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:02.589
Put your opposable thumbs up
for the simian sorceress
herself: Monkey!

553
00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:04.678
The lean. mean
shrinking machine!

554
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:10.901
She puts the pork in chop
and the belly in flop! Pig!

555
00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:13.121
The ham slam!

556
00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:17.473
Bringing the heat.
she'’s the maniac of pyro.

557
00:33:17.647 --> 00:33:19.736
Give it up for... Too hot to handle.

558
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.086
...Dragon!

559
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.612
- That'’s not bad. actually.
- Don'’t encourage this.

560
00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:27.353
If you said it. she'’s heard it.

561
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:30.095
The adorable Rabbit!

562
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:32.184
Cute attack!

563
00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:34.882
She'’s flexible. she'’s fanged.

564
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:38.016
and you definitely
don'’t want to find her
in your sleeping bag!

565
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.929
Snake!

566
00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:41.454
Let'’s snuggle.

567
00:33:41.628 --> 00:33:45.545
The thoroughbred
of speed: Horse!

568
00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:47.851
Maximum horsepower!

569
00:33:48.852 --> 00:33:50.506
Our explosives expert.

570
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.422
the "baaa" of boom...

571
00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:57.122
-  Goat!
- Whoa.

572
00:33:57.296 --> 00:33:58.601
And he'’s serious.

573
00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.256
he'’s complicated.
he'’s selfish...

574
00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:04.868
That'’s it. Show'’s over. Rat.

575
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.435
I'’m bringing them in.

576
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.309
Rude.

577
00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:16.924
Huh. That'’s weird.
Usually there'’s all 12 of us.

578
00:34:17.533 --> 00:34:19.144
This is it?

579
00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:21.233
This is barely a petting zoo.

580
00:34:21.407 --> 00:34:23.670
- Who'’s the kid?
- This is Tom.

581
00:34:23.844 --> 00:34:25.976
- He'’s the Guardian now.
- Hey.

582
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:28.457
New Guardian. huh?

583
00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:30.068
Are you pulling my feathers?

584
00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.722
Look at this kid.
He'’s barely hatched.

585
00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:34.159
Says a chicken.

586
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.551
I'’m a rooster! You hear me?

587
00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:37.118
- A rooster!
- Will you knock it off?

588
00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:38.859
Last time we clucked.
you said

589
00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:42.210
you could protect the Guardian
all by yourself.

590
00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.559
Isn'’t that right. Goat?

591
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:48.086
No explosions indoors.

592
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.698
Are you guys gonna help me?
Loo has to pay
for what she'’s done.

593
00:34:51.872 --> 00:34:55.093
Kid. this isn'’t about revenge.
That'’s not what Guardians do.

594
00:34:55.267 --> 00:34:56.398
Well. maybe they should.

595
00:34:56.572 --> 00:34:58.096
You'’re staying here
in the temple.

596
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.185
- We'’ll deal with Loo.
- What? No!

597
00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:02.274
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Did I miss a meeting

598
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:04.885
where someone
put Mr. Whiskers in charge?

599
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:08.062
Believe me. drumsticks.
I don'’t wanna be here
with you either.

600
00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:09.542
Drumsticks?

601
00:35:09.716 --> 00:35:11.370
I'’ll show you
what drumsticks taste like!

602
00:35:11.544 --> 00:35:13.546
Do I need to knock
you two down a size?

603
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.113
Guys. Hey. Hey!

604
00:35:15.287 --> 00:35:17.767
Fine! If you want me
to show you...

605
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:19.029
That'’s adorable.

606
00:35:19.204 --> 00:35:20.814
Not helping. Naomi.

607
00:35:20.988 --> 00:35:22.337
Think you'’re
so big and tough?

608
00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:24.861
Roosters take out cats
all the time.

609
00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:28.648
Thousands of years old.
and you still behave
like children.

610
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:31.912
So tiny. And so angry.

611
00:35:32.086 --> 00:35:34.219
You'’re one peck away from death.
The death peck.

612
00:35:34.393 --> 00:35:35.785
Well. you'’re lucky
you'’re not lunch.

613
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.962
Hey! Where'’s Tom?

614
00:35:39.876 --> 00:35:41.443
Where'’d he go? Rabbit?

615
00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:44.446
Okay. I hear running.

616
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.144
Into the alley and--

617
00:35:46.318 --> 00:35:48.102
The kid
totally ghosted us.

618
00:35:48.276 --> 00:35:49.930
Yeah. he'’s gone.

619
00:35:50.104 --> 00:35:51.758
Come on.
We can'’t lose him.

620
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:32.842
Sorry.

621
00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:34.322
Wait. you don'’t talk too.
do you?

622
00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:37.151
Of course you don'’t.

623
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:42.591
Squirrels don'’t talk.
just tigers and rats
and monkeys and dragons.

624
00:36:53.123 --> 00:36:54.081
Whoa!

625
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:03.569
What the...

626
00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:14.493
Tom!

627
00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:16.451
If I had known this place

628
00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.411
was so nice on the inside.
I would have robbed it
a long time ago.

629
00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:20.890
It'’s all an illusion.

630
00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:23.197
There'’s dark <i>fashu</i>
at work here.

631
00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:40.127
Let'’s split up.
We can cover more ground
that way.

632
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:41.955
No. We'’re stronger together.

633
00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:43.913
Fine.
We'’ll stick together.

634
00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:46.786
But separately.

635
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.440
How is that sticking together?

636
00:37:48.614 --> 00:37:50.398
Huh?

637
00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:55.882
Am I the only one
who'’s hearing this?

638
00:37:56.056 --> 00:37:58.145
Everybody can hear it.
furball!

639
00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:00.800
I'’m so happy for you.
but it sounds better
in my ears.

640

The other Zodiacs!

650
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:34.268
Loo must have
captured them.

651
00:38:36.226 --> 00:38:38.620
Listen up! My ears got this!

652
00:38:45.018 --> 00:38:46.628
Go! Find the others!

653
00:38:46.802 --> 00:38:47.716

Okay. umbrella!

Get ready for some wings!

656
00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:00.599
Rav?

657
00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:07.736
Rav?

658
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:15.309
Tom! Hi. Um...

659
00:39:16.223 --> 00:39:17.877
What are you doing here?

660
00:39:18.051 --> 00:39:19.705
I'’m living in here.

661
00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:22.272
Is that a sword you'’re carrying?
What is this. cosplay?

662
00:39:22.447 --> 00:39:24.536
You never mentioned you lived
in a haunted mansion.

663
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.320
Haunted?[Loo] Rav.

664
00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:29.105
Aren'’t you going to introduce me
to your little friend?

665
00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:31.543
Yeah. sorry. This is Tom.

666
00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:34.110
Tom. this is
my foster mother. Loo.

667
00:39:34.284 --> 00:39:35.416
Loo?

668
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.333
Tom! What are you doing?

669
00:39:41.117 --> 00:39:42.205
Hello. Thomas.

670
00:39:43.076 --> 00:39:45.818
You are truly a delight.

671
00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.297
What the heck?

672
00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:55.131
What are you?

673
00:39:56.872 --> 00:39:58.265
Go!

674
00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:00.441
He'’s wearing a necklace. Rav.

675
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:01.529
I can'’t stop!

676
00:40:01.703 --> 00:40:03.183
Bring it to me now.

677
00:40:03.357 --> 00:40:04.271
Tom. I--

678
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:06.229
The necklace. Rav?

679
00:40:08.623 --> 00:40:10.582
- He'’s not wearing one.
- What?

680
00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:13.149
He doesn'’t have anything!
Just let him go!

681
00:40:13.323 --> 00:40:14.368
Enough!

682
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.241
- Rav!
- Where is the Phoenix?

683
00:40:18.938 --> 00:40:19.939
Tom!

684
00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:22.637
Tom!

685
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:27.468
I'’ve been searching
for the Phoenix
for a thousand years. Thomas.

686
00:40:27.642 --> 00:40:31.864
Tell me where it is.
and I'’ll spare you.

687
00:40:32.038 --> 00:40:35.084
You and sweet. stupid Rav.

688
00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:39.785
Tell me where it is!

689
00:40:40.525 --> 00:40:42.091
Okay. okay. Please. wait.

690
00:40:42.265 --> 00:40:43.310
Wait.

691
00:40:44.529 --> 00:40:46.574
It'’s under a rock on my porch.

692
00:40:46.748 --> 00:40:49.708
Wait. wait.
No. no. it'’s actually
inside my pocket.

693
00:40:49.882 --> 00:40:51.318
Unless it'’s inside my sock--

694
00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:53.102
You think I'’m a fool?

695
00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:55.409
No. For sure it'’s in my hat.

696
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:56.976
Wait. I'’m not wearing a hat.

697
00:41:00.806 --> 00:41:01.807
Tom!

698
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:08.727
Tiger.

699
00:41:09.249 --> 00:41:10.293
Dragon.

700
00:41:11.338 --> 00:41:12.557
Rat.

701
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.170
Where'’s Monkey?

702
00:41:18.084 --> 00:41:20.608
Ah. perfect.

703
00:41:23.524 --> 00:41:26.353
When the last of you Zodiac
die here with young Thomas.

704
00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:29.791
there will be no one left
to stop me from finding it.

705
00:41:34.927 --> 00:41:36.494
What'’s happening?

706
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.452
Everyone hold on to something!

707
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.498
Whoa!

708
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.288
Ow! Sidney!
Is that my sword?

709
00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:49.942
What?

710
00:41:52.074 --> 00:41:53.902
Uh. everyone can swim. right?

711
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:58.124
Swim? Yes.
Breathe underwater? No!

712
00:42:23.584 --> 00:42:25.325
Guys. I think I found a way out.

713
00:42:25.499 --> 00:42:28.546
but I might be
the only one who can fit.

714
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.983
Oh. I'’ll make us fit.
Everyone. hold tight!

715
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:32.767
Come on!

716
00:42:32.941 --> 00:42:33.899
Okay.

717
00:43:17.464 --> 00:43:22.077
Um. Naomi.
does this shrinking spell
have an expiration date?

718
00:43:23.165 --> 00:43:25.167
Holy shrimp fried rice!

719
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:29.302
I feel so weird.

720
00:43:29.476 --> 00:43:30.564
We may have a problem!

721
00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:31.913
- Hurry. Dragon!
- Oh.

722
00:43:32.087 --> 00:43:33.132
What?

723
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:48.713
Well done. Naomi.

724
00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:50.889
Guys? Guys?

725
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.151
Anyone?

726
00:43:53.456 --> 00:43:55.633
Tom. I--

727
00:43:56.982 --> 00:43:58.374
Thank you for saving me.

728
00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:10.125
I can'’t see!
It'’s all darkness!

729
00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:13.041
Oh. is this the end?

730
00:44:13.215 --> 00:44:15.783
Phew! Well. that went great.

731
00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:22.703
<i>Yaoguai.</i>

732
00:44:22.877 --> 00:44:27.186
Tom. now this is very important.
Where'’d you stash the Phoenix?

733
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.491
Someplace lucky.

734
00:44:29.318 --> 00:44:30.668
I-I hope.

735
00:44:36.325 --> 00:44:38.153
In a bowl of fortune cookies?

736
00:44:38.327 --> 00:44:39.764
Super smart. right?

737
00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:43.898
I guess it'’s "fortunate"
nobody ate it!

738
00:44:59.305 --> 00:45:01.350
I thought it was funny.

739
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.354
I'’ve seen place mats
like these all my life.

740
00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:07.617
And the whole time.
they were based on you guys.

741
00:45:07.792 --> 00:45:09.271
Loosely based.

742
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:10.751
Look at this.

743
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:15.103
What is this. a sausage?
With legs?

744
00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:17.671
I do not have facial hair.

745
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:21.109
I do. And I look good.

746
00:45:23.024 --> 00:45:24.983
I miss Pig.

747
00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:26.419
I miss them all.

748
00:45:26.593 --> 00:45:28.116
They'’re our family.

749
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.336
We gotta save them.

750
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.253
Whatever I need to know
to be a Guardian.
you have to teach me.

751
00:45:34.427 --> 00:45:35.733
Please.

752
00:45:35.907 --> 00:45:38.170
The Guardian always trains
the next Guardian.

753
00:45:39.998 --> 00:45:41.608
Look. the kid'’s right.

754
00:45:41.782 --> 00:45:45.438
Without Mrs. Lee.
we don'’t have much choice.
do we?

755
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.966
Your job is to connect
with the Phoenix.

756
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.228
Mistral?

757
00:45:56.057 --> 00:45:57.189
Whoa.

758
00:45:57.363 --> 00:46:00.018
Clear your mind
of all distraction.

759
00:46:00.192 --> 00:46:02.934
In order to see the Phoenix.
you must focus. Tom.

760
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:08.374
The power of the Phoenix
is the greatest
in this universe.

761
00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:10.637
In the right hands.
it creates.

762
00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:14.423
And in the wrong hands.
like Loo'’s. it destroys.

763
00:46:14.597 --> 00:46:16.730
So what happens
if she gets it?

764
00:46:16.904 --> 00:46:18.776
She'’ll unleash its power
on Lunar New Year.

765
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.996
when the chi is
at its most potent.

766
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.738
Then use the Phoenix
to destroy all of humanity

767
00:46:24.912 --> 00:46:27.654
and reign over the world
in darkness for all of eternity.

768
00:46:27.828 --> 00:46:29.874
Okay. that does sound bad.

769
00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:32.659
If it were ever unleashed.
no one could touch it
and survive.

770
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:34.574
not even a Guardian.

771
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:37.838
But it'’s okay to wear it
around my neck. though.
Got it.

772
00:46:38.012 --> 00:46:39.666
Steamed dumplings.
Very delicious.

773
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.754
I'’m not hungry.

774
00:46:40.928 --> 00:46:43.365
- Eat it!
- I mean. mmm.

775
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:45.411
Tom. pass me the soy sauce.

776
00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:46.847
Without your hands.

777
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:48.936
- How?
- Chi lines.

778
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.461
You know. it'’s like strings
of magical energy
that are everywhere.

779
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:54.028
You just grab on to one.

780
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:55.203
Like this.

781
00:46:56.291 --> 00:46:57.684
Oh.

782
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:01.514
Yo!

783
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.083
Can you see the Phoenix?

784
00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:06.258
No.

785
00:47:06.432 --> 00:47:09.435
I'’m easily scared of everything.

786
00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:11.741
so protection spells
come in handy.

787
00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:14.222
Protection spell!

788
00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:17.443
Protection spell.

789
00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:25.277
Nope. Can you teach me
to blast stuff with <i>fashu</i> now?

790
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.931
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

791
00:47:27.105 --> 00:47:28.410
What did you say? <i>Fashu.</i>

792
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:32.806
Feel the chi inside you.

793
00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.809
And let it flow.

794
00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:39.682
Terrible idea.

795
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.075
<i>Fashu?</i>

796
00:47:41.249 --> 00:47:42.207
<i>Fashu.</i>

797
00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:43.338
Yeah. <i>fashu.</i>

798
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:45.297
<i>Fashu!</i>

799
00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:47.734
<i>Fashu?</i>[Hu] Your intonation'’s
all wrong.

800
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:49.779
No.

801
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.479
Yo! Did you see that?

802
00:47:53.653 --> 00:47:55.611
Fan-- <i>Fan-shu.</i>

803
00:47:55.785 --> 00:47:57.265
You just said
"sweet potato"!

804
00:47:57.439 --> 00:47:58.614
"Sweet potato"!

805
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.054
Yeah!

806
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:05.621
Dessert!

807
00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:10.409
Yes!

808
00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:11.889
- Really?
- No.

809
00:48:12.063 --> 00:48:13.281
Yeah!

810
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:29.471
All of this amounts to nothing
if you can'’t see the Phoenix!

811
00:48:29.645 --> 00:48:31.560
- Hu.
- Whatever!

812
00:48:31.734 --> 00:48:34.520
I'’m sorry I can'’t connect
with the magic bird better. okay?

813
00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:37.827
All the stories Mrs. Lee
told you about the Guardians
and the Zodiac

814
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:39.917
weren'’t just
to get you to sleep.

815
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:42.267
She was teaching you. Tom.

816
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:43.921
I told you.
I didn'’t know I--

817
00:48:44.095 --> 00:48:46.010
You don'’t need to know
to understand.

818
00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:48.664
How about
we all take a break
and cool off.

819
00:48:48.838 --> 00:48:49.883
- Fine!
- Fine!

820
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:57.064
He hates me.

821
00:48:57.238 --> 00:48:58.718
Is that what you think?

822
00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:02.504
- Hu gave his life for you.
- What?

823
00:49:02.678 --> 00:49:05.899
<i>That night on the bridge.
You were just a baby.</i>

824
00:49:13.863 --> 00:49:16.518
<i>Hu saved your life
at great cost.</i>

825
00:49:16.692 --> 00:49:19.521
<i>The Ghost Cart
was coming for him.</i>

826
00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:23.873
<i>Only by giving him
a part of her soul.
by joining it with his.</i>

827
00:49:24.048 --> 00:49:26.311
<i>was Mrs. Lee able to save him.</i>

828
00:49:29.836 --> 00:49:33.579
There'’s a part
of my grandma'’s soul
inside Hu?

829
00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:37.278
You can see it sometimes.
It'’s in the eyes.

830
00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:43.719
I'’m impressed.
He'’s really coming along.

831
00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:45.678
It'’s not enough.
and you know it.

832
00:49:45.852 --> 00:49:48.550
Without a Guardian to teach him
how to connect with the Phoenix.

833
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:49.638
none of the rest matters.

834
00:49:49.812 --> 00:49:51.292
We'’re doing our best. Hu.

835
00:49:52.163 --> 00:49:53.468
But we'’re not Mrs. Lee.

836
00:49:53.642 --> 00:49:55.427
I'’ve been watching him
a long time.

837
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.430
You want to know why
he can'’t connect
with the Phoenix?

838
00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:00.693
'’Cause he doesn'’t know
who he is.

839
00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:04.653
Maybe he never will.

I don'’t understand.

857
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.123
Why didn'’t you tell me?

858
00:51:24.342 --> 00:51:26.866
How am I supposed to
do this without you?

859
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:33.786
No. No. that'’s impossible.

860
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:36.789
Are-- Are you--

861
00:51:37.529 --> 00:51:39.531
Is it really you?

862
00:51:39.705 --> 00:51:42.490
Did you think they could
get rid of me that easily?

863
00:51:43.622 --> 00:51:44.666
Ah Ma.

864
00:51:47.016 --> 00:51:49.889
What happened?
Where did you go?

865
00:51:50.063 --> 00:51:53.110
A bedtime story for later.

866
00:51:53.284 --> 00:51:55.982
Now tell me.
do you still have my necklace?

867
00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.855
You never should have
given it to me.

868
00:52:00.029 --> 00:52:03.729
I am no Guardian.
I can'’t even see the Phoenix.

869
00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:07.515
It'’s okay. Tom.
Everything'’s going to be okay.

870
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:08.821
I'’ll take it now.

871
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:10.127
It'’s not her!

872
00:52:11.519 --> 00:52:12.651
No!

873
00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:14.392
[Tom] Leave her alone!

874
00:52:14.566 --> 00:52:19.353
Oh. look at you.
Somebody'’s been learning.

875
00:52:19.527 --> 00:52:22.487
And you. So ungrateful.

876
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.706
You disappoint your Mama Loo.

877
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.274
Yeah?
You were a terrible mom!

878
00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:30.886
- And your cooking sucked!
- Let'’s go!

879
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.453
- Go. go. go!
- Okay!

880
00:52:49.035 --> 00:52:50.689
Thank you. Thomas.

881
00:52:59.306 --> 00:53:00.742
I can'’t believe
he did this again.

882
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:02.788
Why does he keep
running away from me?

883
00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:07.662
Oh. does he? Or do you keep
pushing him away? Hmm?

884
00:53:07.836 --> 00:53:09.360
- That'’s not true at all.
- Oh. really?

885
00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:11.057
I'’ve had about enough of--Ha!

886
00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:12.580
Typical cat behavior.

887
00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:14.147
What? I don'’t--

888
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:16.323
Fiercely independent?
Territorial?

889
00:53:16.497 --> 00:53:18.717
Should I even mention
the excessive grooming?

890
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:22.068
- Hey.
- A cat won'’t come to you
when you call them.

891
00:53:22.242 --> 00:53:25.811
They want everything
on their own terms.
when it suits them.

892
00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:28.335
even with the people
they truly care about.

893
00:53:28.509 --> 00:53:30.032
Am I wrong?

894
00:53:30.859 --> 00:53:32.339
No.

895
00:53:32.513 --> 00:53:35.342
I pushed them all away.

896
00:53:35.516 --> 00:53:39.912
Tom. the Zodiac.
you probably the most.

897
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.872
But you wouldn'’t
leave me. Dragon.

898
00:53:44.046 --> 00:53:45.570
Why is that?

899
00:53:45.744 --> 00:53:49.356
I guess I'’m just a cat person.

900
00:53:57.364 --> 00:53:58.365
Tom!

901
00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:00.106
I lost it.

902
00:54:01.281 --> 00:54:03.152
Loo has the Phoenix.

903
00:54:42.366 --> 00:54:47.022
I thought
maybe if I went back
to our house.

904
00:54:47.196 --> 00:54:50.025
I could understand
why she didn'’t tell me.

905
00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:51.723
and I just found this.

906
00:54:55.814 --> 00:54:59.034
Wow. I gave that to you
when you were just a baby.

907
00:54:59.992 --> 00:55:01.472
You did?

908
00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:04.649
I'’ve been watching over you
your whole life.

909
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:07.042
Ever since that night
on the bridge.

910
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.132
We knew
Loo would be back.

911
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:14.702
So your grandma and I
decided to hide you.
to protect the bloodline.

912
00:55:14.876 --> 00:55:16.051
And it worked--

913
00:55:16.225 --> 00:55:19.054
Until I threw that kid
into the ceiling?

914
00:55:19.228 --> 00:55:22.319
And pulled down
- the protective charms.
- But you didn'’t know.

915
00:55:22.493 --> 00:55:24.930
I let Loo take the Phoenix.

916
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:28.586
That'’s on me.

917
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.979
I'’m sorry I wasn'’t
the best mentor.

918
00:55:32.459 --> 00:55:35.810
But what I'’m finally realizing
after a thousand years

919
00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:38.857
is what matters most.

920
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:41.773
and that'’s how
you move forward.

921
00:55:41.947 --> 00:55:45.429
I don'’t know if I can be
who you need me to be.

922
00:55:45.603 --> 00:55:46.995
You already are.

923
00:55:47.779 --> 00:55:49.346
It'’s in your blood.

924
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.566
You come
from a thousand generations
of Guardians. Tom.

925
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.482
Your grandma
gave you the necklace.

926
00:55:55.656 --> 00:55:57.092
She believed in you.

927
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.965
All right.

928
00:56:00.748 --> 00:56:02.184
How do we find Loo?

929
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:03.621
We find the Phoenix.

930
00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:08.016
Loo'’s waiting for sundown.
when the energy is at its peak.

931
00:56:14.675 --> 00:56:17.156
All right.
reach out and find that Phoenix.

932
00:56:28.472 --> 00:56:31.736
It'’s too much.

933
00:56:33.128 --> 00:56:34.695
Tom. focus.

934
00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:37.045
I can'’t. I'’m losing it.

935
00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:41.310
Just breathe.
Find something to hold on to.
something to anchor yourself.

936
00:56:41.485 --> 00:56:43.748
It'’s okay. You'’re okay.

937
00:56:54.236 --> 00:56:55.368
Loo!

938
00:56:55.542 --> 00:56:57.892
Thomas. just like
your grandmother.

939
00:56:58.066 --> 00:57:00.242
Persistent to the end.

940
00:57:10.209 --> 00:57:11.253
Whoa!

941
00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:14.474
Hey!

942
00:57:37.192 --> 00:57:39.151
Face full of monkey paw!

943
00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:41.893
Tear the animals apart.

944
00:57:44.156 --> 00:57:46.375
Naughty. naughty <i>yaoguai!</i>

945
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:49.553
Oh. now your hand
is a dumpling!

946
00:57:50.858 --> 00:57:52.469
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Huh?

947
00:57:53.078 --> 00:57:54.253
Bye. Thanks!

948
00:57:59.606 --> 00:58:00.868
Yeah!

949
00:58:47.262 --> 00:58:48.699
Protection spell!

950
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:53.312
Protection spell?

951
00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:56.097
If only you were there
to protect your grandmother.

952
00:58:56.271 --> 00:58:58.230
Monster!

953
00:59:04.802 --> 00:59:06.412
Hang on!

954
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.545
No!

955
00:59:12.897 --> 00:59:14.289
<i>Ah Tom.</i>

956
00:59:14.899 --> 00:59:16.030
Ah Ma.

957
00:59:21.688 --> 00:59:22.863
Tom!

958
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:25.300
Tom!

959
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:31.045
No!

960
00:59:35.746 --> 00:59:36.747
Hu!

961
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:40.751
I just can'’t seem
to stop taking away

962
00:59:40.925 --> 00:59:42.579
all the people you care about.

963
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.904
Poor Thomas.

964
01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:08.474
Do you know why
I didn'’t kill you
that night on the bridge?

965
01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:14.045
<i>Even then.
I saw it in your eyes.</i>

966
01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:18.832
<i>You were no threat.
because you were no Guardian.</i>

967
01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:21.922
No. that'’s just another lie.
Hu saved me that night.

968
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.056
Well. where'’s
your tiger now?

969
01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:31.018
Hey! Loo'’s umbrella!

970
01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:33.804
Quick. grab it!
We gotta free the other Zodiacs!

971
01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:37.590
This is crazy! This is crazy!

972
01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:40.680
I got it. I got it.

973
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:43.814
No!

974
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:49.036
I got it!
Chasing an evil umbrella
through a swarm of monsters.

975
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.603
This is fine!

976
01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:52.561
Naomi! A little help here.

977
01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.827
This is how you help?

978
01:00:57.001 --> 01:01:02.528
You have no idea
how long I'’ve waited
for this moment.

979
01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:06.227
With the power of the Phoenix.
I can remake the world

980
01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.101
without humans.

981
01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.932
and I'’ve saved you
a front-row seat.

982
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.250
Anytime. Naomi!

983
01:01:29.424 --> 01:01:31.992
Let my friends go.
you stupid umbrella!

984
01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:51.533
All right. Zodiacs.
We got a Guardian to protect!
Together.

985
01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:53.622
Let'’s do this!

986
01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:04.851
Tom?

987
01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.552
No. No!

988
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.426
Look at it. Thomas.
Isn'’t it beautiful?

989
01:02:18.604 --> 01:02:20.214
We'’re coming. kid!

990
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.478
Way ahead of you. Tiger!

991
01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:26.655
Giddyap!

992
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.528
I'’ll show you who'’s in charge!

993
01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:32.531
Cannonball!

994
01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:39.973
Throw me another one!

995
01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:41.409
Yeah. that'’s right.

996
01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:43.716
Can you hear that?

997
01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:59.079
Hu! Yeah! Zodiac up!

998
01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:15.792
Whoa.

999
01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:21.493
Whee!

1000
01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:22.624
Whoa!

1001
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.062
Monkey foot!

1002
01:03:31.764 --> 01:03:32.809
Hi-yah!

1003
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:35.812
Goat!

1004
01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:42.949
You'’re too late!

1005
01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:57.398
Enough!

1006
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.665
Now I end this
once and for all.

1007
01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:09.062
Come. Thomas.

1008
01:04:09.236 --> 01:04:11.325
You can die fighting

1009
01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.762
just like your grandmother did.

1010
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.605
We don'’t need to fight.

1011
01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:34.131
What do you think
you'’re doing. boy?

1012
01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:37.177
We don'’t need these.

1013
01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:40.267
We need this.

1014
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.703
And this.

1015
01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:46.143
I understand now. Ah Ma.

1016
01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:53.411
Come. boy. Fight me.

1017
01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:55.761
Tom.

1018
01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:00.592
I see the Phoenix.

1019
01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:04.074
No!

1020
01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:17.130
Shh. Hey.

1021
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.872
It'’s okay.

1022
01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:22.962
I'’m here to protect you.

1023
01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:45.811
In your hands.
the Phoenix destroys!

1024
01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:52.470
No!

1025
01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:54.646
But in the right hands...

1026
01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:33.554
Tom! Wake up!

1027
01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:35.774
Tom. do you hear me?

1028
01:06:37.428 --> 01:06:39.038
Guys. he'’s not breathing.

1029
01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:41.823
Tom?

1030
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.782
Come on. stay with us. buddy.

1031
01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:46.915
No. No!

1032
01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:49.962
We just can'’t let him die.

1033
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:52.312
Nu Kua?

1034
01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.141
Do it.

1035
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:56.751
Okay. quick!

1036
01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:58.492
It'’s gonna take
all of us together.

1037
01:06:58.666 --> 01:06:59.798
Thank you. my friends.

1038
01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:23.256
Empress! I seek your help!

1039
01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:25.258
Empress!

1040
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:40.708
My apprentice.
he sacrificed himself
to save the mortals.

1041
01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:43.798
The boy is beyond healing.

1042
01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.583
But not beyond saving.

1043
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:51.980
Look down. Tiger.
Tell me. what do you see?

1044
01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:54.940
Water. An ocean.

1045
01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:59.945
The Sea of Tears.
where all souls go at the end.

1046
01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:08.345
Take mine instead.

1047
01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:10.999
Merge our souls
as Mrs. Lee did for me!

1048
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.186
You could die
along with him.

1049
01:08:23.882 --> 01:08:25.231
I'’m not afraid.

1050
01:08:26.624 --> 01:08:27.625
I see that.

1051
01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:32.020
Your spirit has never
been subtle. Tiger.

1052
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:39.985
Repeat these words.

1053
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.250
"With my blood. I join you."

1054
01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:46.948
With my blood. I join you.

1055
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:50.561
"With my breath. I bind you."

1056
01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:56.262
With my breath.
I bind you.

1057
01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.602
Hey. kid.

1058
01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:33.995
What happened to you?

1059
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.345
What do you know?

1060
01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:38.174
I guess a tiger
can change his stripes!

1061
01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:41.568
Great.
Now I'’m gonna be hearing
that one forever.

1062
01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:44.876
So you couldn'’t
let me die. huh?

1063
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.095
Yeah. let'’s not make
some big fuss about it.

1064
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.506
Thomas Lee.

1065
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.858
we name you Guardian.

1066
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.863
- Nice work.
- Congratulations.

1067
01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:19.432
You'’re gonna do great. kid.
the sooner you listen
to everything that I say.

1068
01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:22.609
They grow up so fast.

1069
01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:27.484
Is he your fiancé?

1070
01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.964
What? No.
We'’re in high school.

1071
01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:32.010
It'’s not too late.

1072
01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:35.492
There'’s just one more thing
I have for you.

1073
01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:40.932
A sacred gift.

1074
01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:47.591
Uh. cool. It'’s empty.

1075
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.114
What?

1076
01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:50.463
Hmm. okay. okay.

1077
01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:51.595
It'’s like a metaphor.
isn'’t it?

1078
01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:53.379
Sid.

1079
01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:57.905
What? Oh. sure. blame the rat.
I see how it is.

1080
01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.822
I have no idea
how it got there.

1081
01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.436
I-I-I made you a key
to my shop.

1082
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:10.657
That'’s your sacred gift?

1083
01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:15.575
I figured you'’ve got
more training to do and you'’re
gonna need somewhere to stay.

1084
01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:20.101
so maybe it would make sense
if you. I don'’t know.
consider it your--

1085
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.799
Home?

1086
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.499
Yeah. I mean. if you want.

1087
01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:31.330
Well. I do have
a piece of your soul in me.

1088
01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:34.986
so I guess that
kind of makes us family.

1089
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:45.301
Okay. I knew we were
gonna need tissues.
You big softy.

1090
01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:47.259
I'’m proud of you. Hu.

1091
01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.305
It'’s whatever they'’re
putting in the incense
these days.

1092
01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:51.219
Yeah. Good cover.

1093
01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.483
I get that you'’re.
like. old-school.

1094
01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:55.920
but it'’s okay
to have emotions.

1095
01:11:57.965 --> 01:12:00.098
You'’re about to see
some emotions. apprentice.

1096
01:12:00.272 --> 01:12:02.709
Apprentice? Guardian.

1097
01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:05.582
You'’ve still got a lot
to learn.

1098
01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.584
I'’m sorry.

1099
01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:10.282
Were you the one who grabbed
the actual Phoenix
and saved the world?

1100
01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:13.633
I don'’t think so![Hu] I'’m the one who saved
your sorry butt over and over.

1101
01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:17.028
Did I ask for your help?
I had it back there.

1102
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:33.566
"Eye of the Tiger"?
You gotta be kidding me.

1103
01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.307
It'’s a classic.

1104
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.135
That'’s not the point.[Hu] What?

1105
01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:38.745
- You'’re a tiger.
- So what?

1106
01:12:38.919 --> 01:12:40.791
Are you really not
understanding how this is--

1107
01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:43.794
This song is
written for me.[Tom] Let me just--

1108
01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:46.579
Do not touch that.
Just let me play my music.

1109
01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:48.451
Oh. yeah.

1110
01:12:49.582 --> 01:12:51.758
Oh. yeah. That'’s my jam.

1111
01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:53.586
You really need to get out more.

1112
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:57.155
And you need more training.

1113
01:12:58.591 --> 01:12:59.853
Whoa!

1114
01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:01.768
Okay. hold on!

1115
01:13:01.942 --> 01:13:03.901
Hu enjoys this
far too much.

1116
01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:05.946
Five bucks
the kid aces it.

1117
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.383
You'’re on.

1118
01:13:07.557 --> 01:13:09.515
Just FYI.
I don'’t have money.

1119
01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.563
Whoa. Hey.
what are you doing?

1120
01:13:15.347 --> 01:13:18.872
Whoa! Stop!
No! Wait! Hey. No. No.

1121
01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:39.066
Cool.

1122
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.199
