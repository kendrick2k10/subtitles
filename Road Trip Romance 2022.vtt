00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.333
Megan Miller.

6
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.333
Are you in Denver?

7
00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.767
Megan: Oh. hello. Mrs. Evans.

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.367
Not for three more days.

9
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.767
Megan: Yes. I'm in Denver.

10
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
On my way to
the client as we speak.

11
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.033
but I'm so excited
about tonight.

12
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.333
Me too.

13
00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.200
Is Mom? Is she staying sane?

14
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.700
Well. she volunteered
to coordinate corsages

15
00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.367
for the wedding party. So...

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.433
How hard could that be?
Thank you.

17
00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.567
Do you know how many flowers
are in bloom right now?

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.400
I mean. she's obsessing.

19
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.967
She just wants
everything to be perfect.

20
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.834
Yeah. I do. too.

21
00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.433
Megan: And it will
be better than perfect.

22
00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.900
It will be real
and full of heart.

23
00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.133
Just like the bride.

24
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.233
I'm marrying Jack.

25
00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:18.900
I still can't quite believe it.

26
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:20.834
I know he is
one heck of a catch.

27
00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.500
After all. he is
the luckiest guy in the world.

28
00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.300
Yeah. he kind of is.

29
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.233
Alright. Showtime. I gotta buzz.

30
00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:29.467
I'll see you at 7:00.

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.066
Okay. but don't be late.

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Megan: Neither snow
nor rain nor gloom of the night

33
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.400
will keep this
maid of honor from being at

34
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.967
her sister's bachelorette party.

35
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.934
Mom: Blair! Blair!
We've had a breakthrough!

37
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.934
Uh. I'll be down in a few. Mom.

38
00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.300
May I help you?

39
00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.567
Hi. I'm Megan Miller.
I have a 10:00 o'clock

40
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.533
appointment with Mrs. O'Reilly.
Fun For All.

41
00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.834
She's still with
her 9:00 o'clock.

42
00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.233
but it shouldn't be too long.

43
00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:12.500
Would you like a water?

44
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.734
Um. no. that's okay. Thanks.

45
00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:20.166
Okay. I'll just go--
I'll sit over there. Thanks.

46
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:39.166
For the bridesmaids I was
thinking roses or carnations.

47
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.633
because. I mean. naturally
that's what you do. right?

48
00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.633
But then I thought.
where's the fun in that?

49
00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.500
If we keep to a color scheme.

50
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.300
we could do a parade
of different flowers.

51
00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:52.467
Roses. carnations.
daisies. lisianthis.

52
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.667
whatever all nestled
in baby's breath.

53
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.033
I mean you can never go wrong
with baby's breath. right?

54
00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.967
Uh. yeah.

55
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.433
The eye will be drawn in
and pow. the dresses will pop.

56
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.033
Whatever you want mom.

57
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:08.567
No. it's whatever you want.
It's your day.

58
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.967
Well. I want you to pick.

59
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.767
because whatever
you choose will be amazing.

60
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.033
Hi. Mrs. M.

61
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.033
Hi. Della.

62
00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.033
Oh! Sorry.

63
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.533
- Is it 10:30 already?
- Just about.

64
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.133
We'll see how the flowers
look on the girls.

65
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.400
Okay. Want to bring them up?

66
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:23.900
Okay.

67
00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:36.900
Excuse me.

68
00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:38.934
Did Mrs. O'Riley mention
how much longer she's gonna be?

69
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.700
I'm sorry. No.

70
00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:44.734
Oh. Well. that 9:00
must be going real well.

71
00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:46.200
Probably just got
Ms. O'Riley talking.

72
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.600
When she starts
she could go all day.

73
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.300
Well. that's good to know. Thanks.

74
00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:53.233
Do you have another
appointment to get to?

75
00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.734
Nope.
This is my only stop in Denver.

76
00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:57.266
I just--

77
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.200
I have a flight to
catch this afternoon.

78
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:01.900
Oh. that shouldn't be a problem.

79
00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:05.667
Sure I can't get you a water?

80
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.066
You know what?
I will get that water.

81
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.500
Mom!

82
00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:22.800
I love the colors.

83
00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:24.800
Yeah. it turned out great.

84
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:29.133
Yes! Like I said. amazing.

85
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:30.633
Yeah.

86
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.734
Oh.

87
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.700
I never did get
the hang of these.

88
00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:40.100
You look fabulous.

89
00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.333
Man:

90
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:54.967
You know.
I hear it's a beautiful stadium.

91
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.834
Mrs. O'Riley:
It is! It's a real gem.

92
00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:00.834
Next time I'm in town I'll have
to try and catch a game.

93
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.533
Let me know.
We have excellent box seats.

94
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:04.934
I'll set you up.

95
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:07.734
That'd be amazing.

96
00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:11.066
Alden Brown.

97
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.400
Megan Miller?

98
00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:14.367
Both: What are you doing here?

99
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.233
Novelties R Us?

100
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:18.100
Fun For All?

101
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:19.867
You must be my 10:00 o'clock.

102
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.667
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

103
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
Novelties R Us is your company.

104
00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.500
And Fun For All is yours.

105
00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:29.233
Thank you for stopping in. Alden.

106
00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:30.500
We'll be in touch.

107
00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:32.266
Yes. and if you
have any questions.

108
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.100
just give me a call
or shoot me an email.

109
00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.533
Of course.

110
00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:41.066
I have kept you waiting
long enough. Miss...

111
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.333
Megan is totally fine.

112
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.600
Oh. I'm Leanne.

113
00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:44.867
Nice to meet you.

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.266
So. you and Alden
know each other?

115
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
Yeah. we grew up together.

116
00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:50.266
We went to rival high schools.

117
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.867
Oh! Small world.

118
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.967
Yeah. sure is. Too small.

119
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.300
That's adorable.

120
00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:13.467
Yeah. and as you can see
from our promotional materials.

121
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.767
we have a dynamic product line
with a ton of variety.

122
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.633
I gotta admit. the hand-sewn
whoopee cushion made me smile.

123
00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:24.400
but these guys--

124
00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:27.500
The perfect poster toy for
what Fun For All is all about.

125
00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.000
See all our toys are
traditional mechanics.

126
00:06:30.133 --> 00:06:31.333
So. no electronics.

127
00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:33.967
Oh. my kids would love these.

128
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.400
And our packaging doubles as
eye-catching store displays.

129
00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:40.734
So. the entire product line
is really going to stand out

130
00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.066
in your department stores.

131
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.934
If we decide to
carry vintage toys.

132
00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.500
No. you must.

133
00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:48.500
People nowadays.
especially children.

134
00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:50.233
they're turning off technology.

135
00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.233
They're oversaturated.

136
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:56.433
The market for old-fashioned
toys is exploding.

137
00:06:56.567 --> 00:07:00.233
Well. it must be if two sharp
Millennials like you and Alden

138
00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:03.000
have started
competing companies.

139
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:05.033
Competition in name only.

140
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.400
My product line is the best.

141
00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:10.867
You're really passionate
about what you do.

142
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.467
Yeah.

143
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.934
Fun For All has been
a dream of mine since...

144
00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:18.033
Since I can remember.

145
00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.633
I like that.

146
00:07:19.767 --> 00:07:23.734
But the thing is. Megan.
Mountain State Consolidated

147
00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:27.166
has gotten to where it is.
the largest most profitable

148
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.066
chain of family-owned
department stores in the region.

149
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.900
because we always
expand prudently.

150
00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:36.567
Respecting verities.

151
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.967
That's what Fun For All
is all about.

152
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.000
Let me walk you through
the Mountain State story.

153
00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.800
Show you how we got here.

154
00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:49.066
Well. it all started with
Great Grandpa O'Riley.

155
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.033
a man of vision.

156
00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:54.200
In the spring of 1890.

157
00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:57.000
he stowed away in
the hold of a freighter.

158
00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:00.600
Blair. you will never guess who
I just ran into! Alden brown!

159
00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:03.233
The guy from Central High?

160
00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:04.467
Megan: Yes!

161
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.734
You saw him where?

162
00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:07.533
We were pitching
to the same client.

163
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:11.200
Apparently. he has his own
vintage toy business.

164
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.133
Wow. What are the chances?

165
00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.367
I wish I had a trigger warning.

166
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.767
Seeing him brought back so many
high school horror stories.

167
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.033
Blair: Yeah. I bet.

168
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.567
Debates. the pep club showdowns.

169
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.300
We competed then
and we're competing now.

170
00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:25.867
but this time
he is not going to win.

171
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.600
You go. girl.

172
00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.734
I am on my way to the airport.

173
00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:31.066
I will see you soon.

174
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.734
Megan. you did
remember to bring--

175
00:08:32.867 --> 00:08:34.533
That super something
special borrowed to go with

176
00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:36.200
your old. new. and blue?

177
00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:37.633
Uh-huh. Of course. I did.

178
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.100
Why did I even ask?

179
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.567
Oh. no.

180
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.734
What?

181
00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:47.400
The Denver Airport is closed.

182
00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:49.600
What? Why?

183
00:08:49.734 --> 00:08:52.533
Wildcat baggage handler strike?

184
00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:54.467
You're still coming tonight.
right?

185
00:09:00.734 --> 00:09:02.100
Got to go. Bye.

186
00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:06.533
It's a regional strike.

187
00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:09.100
So. Colorado Springs
is still open.

188
00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:11.867
There's a flight leaving to
Wichita in about three hours.

189
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.367
So. I was thinking
that I could rent a car...

190
00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.166
To...

191
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.367
Blair. I'm going to
call you back. Bye.

192
00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.533
Excuse me.

193
00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:32.367
I really need to rent
a car like five minutes ago.

194
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.667
Oh. okay.

195
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.033
I'll ask all the other
people in line to step aside

196
00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:38.667
so you can go first.

197
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.266
Really? Oh. thank you so much.

198
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.266
Yeah. everybody needs to run
a car like 10 minutes ago.

199
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.667
Um...

200
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.200
The thing is. it's an emergency.

201
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.166
It's not like I'm having a baby
or a heart attack

202
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.867
or I need a car
to save the world.

203
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.934
but my sister is getting married
and her bachelorette party

204
00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:57.667
is tonight.

205
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.533
Wow. a bachelorette party.

206
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:01.800
That does sound important.

207
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:05.333
Yeah. No. it's not.

208
00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:06.767
I'm really sorry. Stella.

209
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.266
You must be having
a really stressful day

210
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.333
and I'm being a total jerk.

211
00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:12.233
It's just
I'm the maid of honor and...

212
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.700
I'm hosting the party.
and it's for my little sister.

213
00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:17.967
and I've always
been there for her

214
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.467
and I never let her down and...

215
00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:22.000
...the thought of me
letting her down

216
00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:24.233
and not being there for her.
it just...

217
00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:26.767
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.467
Sorry. Stella.

219
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.867
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Have a nice day.

220
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.300
Me?

221
00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.166
I would do anything
for my little sister

222
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.867
Anything.

223
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.967
Follow me.

224
00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:54.033
Megan. hey! Did you get a car!?

225
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.700
- Can't talk. Alden.
- Where are you headed?

226
00:10:55.834 --> 00:10:57.266
Colorado Springs. I'm catching
a flight to Wichita.

227
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.533
Wichita?

228
00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:00.867
I need to get the Wichita.

229
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.333
Well. good luck with that.

230
00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:03.567
Let me come with you.

231
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.100
No. thank you.

232
00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:07.500
I'll pay for gas.
I'll pay for the rental fee.

233
00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:11.200
I will buy you
a first class upgrade.

234
00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:12.734
Are you pleading with me?

235
00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:14.000
Begging.

236
00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:15.934
Megan. please.
It's an emergency.

237
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:17.934
An emergency? Are you having
a baby? A heart attack?

238
00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:19.533
Have you been tasked
to save the world?

239
00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.233
It's my dad.

240
00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:23.667
It's his retirement party.

241
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.900
The entire family's
going to be there.

242
00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:26.433
Everyone's flying in.

243
00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:28.500
I've never missed
a really important family event.

244
00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:31.600
and I've never not been
there for my dad. not ever.

245
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.200
How can I say no to that?

246
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.967
Let me grab my stuff.

247
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.367
Well-played.

248
00:11:44.233 --> 00:11:46.133
I call shotgun.

249
00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:56.734
Alden: Hey. I noticed
you don't have a suitcase.

250
00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:58.100
Yeah. I checked it
through to Wichita

251
00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:00.800
when I left from
Seattle this morning.

252
00:12:00.934 --> 00:12:04.166
Wait. you live In Seattle. too?

253
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.266
This day keeps on
getting better and better.

254
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.333
I live in Belltown.
Where do you live?

255
00:12:09.467 --> 00:12:10.700
That's great. We're neighbors.

256
00:12:12.734 --> 00:12:14.967
I'm feeling a bit of
a chill over here. Megatron.

257
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.900
Don't call me that.
My friends only call me that

258
00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:18.433
and you are definitely
not one of them.

259
00:12:18.567 --> 00:12:19.800
Well. high school was ages ago.

260
00:12:19.934 --> 00:12:22.367
So. maybe we could
be friends now.

261
00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:25.934
Not until you give me
that trophy stole for me back.

262
00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:27.233
What trophy?

263
00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:29.400
Regional debate champ.
Senior year.

264
00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:30.900
Uh. I won that fair and square.

265
00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:32.700
Oh. no. you did not.

266
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.433
Alden: Oh. no.

267
00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:37.934
Well. I guess we're not the only
ones with a bright idea.

268
00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:40.767
Colorado Springs to Wichita.
sold out.

269
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.500
I guess you're going
to be flying without me.

270
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.734
What?

271
00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:48.266
I never got a flight.

272
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.400
I thought I could just buy
a plane ticket at the airport.

273
00:12:52.533 --> 00:12:53.633
Oh.

274
00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:56.400
It's okay. It's totally okay.

275
00:12:56.533 --> 00:12:57.633
When's the next flight?

276
00:12:57.767 --> 00:13:00.066
Not until tomorrow.

277
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.567
Okay. What are we gonna do?

278
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.200
Go back to Denver?

279
00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:07.033
Maybe there's a bus
that'll take us to Wichita.

280
00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:08.667
No. that's going
to take forever.

281
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.567
- Why don't we just drive there?
- Let's just drive there.

282
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.133
- Can't be that far.
- 78 hours tops.

283
00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:18.367
We'd be there by midnight.

284
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.834
I'll miss
the bachelorette party.

285
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.066
And my dad's barbecue
isn't until Sunday.

286
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.533
But I'll make it
in time for the wedding.

287
00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:23.800
Cousins. I can hang out
with them on Saturday.

288
00:13:23.934 --> 00:13:25.233
And the rehearsal dinner.

289
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.667
Seven to eight hours in the car.

290
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.066
Together.

291
00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:36.400
For my sister.

292
00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:39.400
For my dad.

293
00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.567
I still want that trophy.

294
00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:45.166
I'm not even sure
if I still have it.

295
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.467
Yes. you are and yes. you do.

296
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.066
Top shelf in the family room.

297
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.166
right next to my
Student of the Year award.

298
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.600
That's gonna look
so perfect next to mine.

299
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.200
Blair: Oh. no!

300
00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.934
Megan: I know. I'm so bummed.

301
00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:06.633
There's no way at all
that you can get here on time?

302
00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:10.600
No. and I wrote
a killer toast. too.

303
00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:13.567
Why don't you email it to me?
I'll read it to everyone.

304
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.266
No. you can't read it!
It has to be read to you.

305
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.767
You'll see. I know!

306
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.300
Okay. Why don't you
call me back when it's time

307
00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:23.433
and I'll read the toast
over the phone?

308
00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:25.400
Perfect. Hey. I gotta jump off.

309
00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:27.533
Jack's here. but keep me
posted on your progress.

310
00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.633
- Megan: I will.
- Bye.

311
00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:31.200
Hi. handsome.

312
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:33.133
Sorry. I only let
my fiance call me that.

313
00:14:35.266 --> 00:14:36.533
What brings you here?

314
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.767
Baby's breath.

315
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.266
For your mom.

316
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400
Ah. yes. the wedding party look.

317
00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.400
we have a ton of
baby's breath in our garden.

318
00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:45.700
It's over-flowering with it.

319
00:14:46.867 --> 00:14:49.033
Jack.

320
00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:51.800
So. Megan's not going to be able
to make the bachelorette party.

321
00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:53.633
- Why not?
- She can't get a flight.

322
00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:55.767
She's driving in
from Denver instead.

323
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.266
I thought she was
hosting the party.

324
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.200
I'll enlist Della to do it.

325
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.834
Ah. you'll Della-gate her.

326
00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.834
Three more days. Jack.
and then that's it.

327
00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:05.834
No more puns. You promised.

328
00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:08.500
I know. I'm just trying
to get it out of my system

329
00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.633
so we can enjoy
our pun-free-moon.

330
00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:22.934
You know. you get better mileage
if you use cruise control.

331
00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:24.367
I'm not really worried
about the mileage.

332
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.734
You're paying for the gas.

333
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.834
Okay if I put the radio on?

334
00:15:32.967 --> 00:15:35.133
No. no music.
I find it very distracting.

335
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.700
How about talk radio?

336
00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:39.967
No.

337
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.800
Podcast?

338
00:15:41.934 --> 00:15:44.200
No. Why don't you just listen
to something on your phone?

339
00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:46.533
I can't. earbuds in a moving
vehicle making me nauseous.

340
00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:47.867
Okay. then read something.

341
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.400
That's even worse.

342
00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:54.700
Why don't we play a game?

343
00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:55.700
20 Questions?

344
00:15:55.834 --> 00:15:57.166
No. thank you.

345
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.166
- Alphabet.
- You'd cheat.

346
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.500
I would not cheat.

347
00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:02.900
A leopard cannot
change his stripes.

348
00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:04.533
Spots.

349
00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:06.333
Whatever.

350
00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.066
This is about that debate.
isn't it?

351
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.367
For starters.

352
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.100
You actually think
that I cheated.

353
00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:12.367
No. I know that you did.

354
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.734
Really? How?

355
00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:17.233
Resolved cafeteria food
fails to meet RDA guidelines?

356
00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:21.066
You presented totally
bogus data to show that it does.

357
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.934
And were you able to
prove that the data was--

358
00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.367
- Data were.
- Bogus in rebuttal?

359
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:30.333
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

360
00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:32.333
I was having internet problems.

361
00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:33.834
I didn't have
time to research it.

362
00:16:33.967 --> 00:16:36.100
Ah. see. I was in
the same auditorium

363
00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:38.567
using the same internet
and funny. I didn't have any

364
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.000
trouble rebutting your claims.

365
00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:42.500
Oh. yeah. with bogus data.

366
00:16:42.633 --> 00:16:44.767
Robert's Rules of Order
clearly state

367
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.533
that it is the burden
of the rebutter--

368
00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:48.834
I do know! I know. I know.
I know the rules.

369
00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.700
Case closed. Case closed.

370
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.000
Cheater.

371
00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:02.667
Sore loser.

372
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.600
Well. you're going to be
a sore loser this time around.

373
00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:08.233
because that Consolidated
account is mine.

374
00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.266
You haven't seen
my product line.

375
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.767
Oh. I have. I always
research the competition.

376
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.300
Really? Well. so have I.

377
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:17.333
I've seen your stuff.

378
00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:18.400
I know and it rocks.

379
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:20.567
It's not bad.

380
00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:26.633
You are going to hate
the taste of my dust.

381
00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:28.934
We'll see about that.

382
00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:41.100
Of course. if you want to give
me a hard time about that debate

383
00:17:41.233 --> 00:17:42.433
I could say the same thing about

384
00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:44.767
the school spirit
film competition.

385
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.300
Oh. give me a break. that movie.
if you can even call it that.

386
00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:50.433
was totally amateurish.

387
00:17:50.567 --> 00:17:53.233
As it should be in
a film made by amateurs.

388
00:17:53.367 --> 00:17:54.467
And what is your point?

389
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.900
Charles Garvey.

390
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.667
Charles? Okay.
What about Charles?

391
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.500
Award-winning documentarian.

392
00:17:59.633 --> 00:18:02.400
Oh. and the father of your
classmate Toby Garvey.

393
00:18:02.533 --> 00:18:03.967
The director of your film.

394
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.066
Who clearly inherited
his father's talents.

395
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.734
Not to mention his
state-of-the-art camera.

396
00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:11.734
sound. and lighting equipment.
and his participation.

397
00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:14.066
He was only a consultant
on the movie.

398
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.834
- Like ducks.
- "Like ducks."

399
00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:18.400
Who says like ducks?

400
00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:19.467
But I'm not going to give
you a hard time about it.

401
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.700
You know why?

402
00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:22.500
No. but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

403
00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:25.467
Because it was a competition
and people compete to win.

404
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.400
You have a genius
for stating the obvious.

405
00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:30.400
Come to think of it.
I may have been the best thing

406
00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:32.166
that ever happened
to you in high school.

407
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.066
I gave you someone
to compete against.

408
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.934
But like you said. we're not
in high school anymore.

409
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.000
Yet here we are.
still competing.

410
00:18:43.967 --> 00:18:47.533
"Best thing to happen
to me in high school?"

411
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:48.967
I know you are annoying.

412
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.834
but I did not think
you were delusional.

413
00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:53.000
You know I'm right.

414
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.133
What?

415
00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.333
Where's the car?

416
00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:00.900
Did we park it somewhere else?

417
00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.400
No. no. We parked
in front of the window

418
00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:04.066
with the caramel corn sign.

419
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.633
That's why I bought some.
It was smart ad placement.

420
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:09.367
Someone stole our car?

421
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.400
- My luggage is in there!
- My sample suitcase. my phone!

422
00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:13.734
My something borrowed.

423
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:23.200
Megan: I really appreciate
all your help with this all.

424
00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.900
Are you sure there's
nothing else I can do?

425
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.567
Thanks.

426
00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:31.967
What did he say?

427
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.333
Well. he issued an APB.

428
00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:35.567
Well. if they're tracking
your cell. we'll find

429
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.133
my phone. though. right?

430
00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:40.200
You didn't
activate that feature?

431
00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:41.633
I don't like that thing.
I don't like that someone

432
00:19:41.767 --> 00:19:43.367
can track me down.
I find it very creepy.

433
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.900
Besides. it doesn't matter
if they don't find the phone.

434
00:19:45.033 --> 00:19:46.533
I'm not the owner of it.

435
00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:48.400
They have to send it
back to the car rental place.

436
00:19:48.533 --> 00:19:51.300
which can't send us a new one.
because the airport strike.

437
00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:53.066
they're all booked up.

438
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.133
Mm-hm. Well. I contacted Uber
and Lyft and every ride company

439
00:19:56.266 --> 00:19:58.367
that you've never heard of.
No one is going to take us

440
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.700
because they all need
a fair back to Wichita.

441
00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:02.467
which I guess makes sense.

442
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.834
Making sense does not
get us to Wichita.

443
00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:08.800
No. but I have
something that does.

444
00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:25.233
He wanted $5.000 for it.
but I sweet-talked him down to

445
00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:27.834
four and a half.
and a free tank of gas.

446
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.800
You bought this?

447
00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:35.900
Yeah. put it on my card.

448
00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.600
Well. how do you
even know it runs?

449
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.967
That's really reassuring.
like everything printed

450
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.200
on a dot matrix is.

451
00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:47.700
Okay. have a little faith.
alright?

452
00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:50.066
The guy's in mechanic.
said the engines cherry.

453
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.834
Wow. if I had known
that you were this gullible

454
00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:55.967
in high school.
I would have never lost to you.

455
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.533
If you got a better idea
on how to get us to Wichita.

456
00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:00.200
I'd love to hear it.

457
00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:05.567
Must be your sister.

458
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.800
Blair. hi.

459
00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:13.734
Hey. I just got your message.

460
00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:15.734
The car was stolen?

461
00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:18.533
Yeah. I know.
but we landed another one.

462
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:19.900
Blair: Oh. good.

463
00:21:20.033 --> 00:21:21.200
Okay. I need to call
back on this phone

464
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.800
when it's time
for the toast. okay?

465
00:21:22.934 --> 00:21:24.233
And whose phone is this?

466
00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.767
Alden Brown.

467
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.100
What?

468
00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:32.934
I know. I know.

469
00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:34.533
I'll tell you about it
when I see you next. okay?

470
00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:35.867
I'll talk to you later.

471
00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:40.433
Alright. let's get this
dog and pony show on the road.

472
00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.400
Oh. that door doesn't open.

473
00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:43.800
Gotta use the driver door.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:53.767

Megan: My shoe!

478
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.300
Alden: Okay.
Oh. we're going to have to...

479
00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:03.867

Not really.

484
00:22:20.734 --> 00:22:22.834
Look. I'm trying
not to be annoying.

485
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:24.100
Not everything is about you.

486
00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:26.033
And apparently I'm failing.

487
00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:28.667
It's my something borrowed.

488
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.333
Yeah. What is that about anyway?

489
00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:32.000
It's tradition.

490
00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:33.467
The bride. She always
wears something old.

491
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.700
something new. something...

492
00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:36.133
Something borrowed.
something blue.

493
00:22:36.266 --> 00:22:37.367
- Yeah.
- Got it.

494
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.767
So. Blair's something borrowed

495
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.367
she was borrowing from me.

496
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.467
It was this beautiful
vintage shawl I found at

497
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.300
a Good Will in high school.
and I actually wore it--

498
00:22:45.433 --> 00:22:46.800
To senior prom.

499
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.500
How do you know that?

500
00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:51.133
I was there. remember?
The time I was dating--

501
00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:53.500
Katie MacDougall. I remember.
Yeah. right.

502
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:55.367
It was a beautiful shawl.

503
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.100
Guys aren't supposed
to notice stuff like that.

504
00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:02.233
Well. I did.

505
00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:04.867
Well. Blair.
she thought it was beautiful too

506
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.433
and she designed her whole
wedding dress around it.

507
00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:08.700
but now it's gone.

508
00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:10.266
I had it in my sample suitcase.

509
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.600
You know. in case
the airlines lost my luggage.

510
00:23:13.734 --> 00:23:15.934
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

511
00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:20.266
I'm just turning out to be
the worst maid of honor ever.

512
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.800
Your sister won't mind.

513
00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:24.500
Yeah. but I do.

514
00:23:31.834 --> 00:23:33.100
You know.
I remember your sister.

515
00:23:33.233 --> 00:23:35.700
She was one heck
of a cheerleader.

516
00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:37.934
Yeah. she is. Allstate.

517
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.700
Who's she marrying?
Anybody I know?

518
00:23:41.834 --> 00:23:43.266
Jack Evans. He went to Central.

519
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.700
She's marrying Greenback Jack?

520
00:23:44.834 --> 00:23:46.166
Oh. yeah. She is.

521
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.767
That guy was money in the bank.

522
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.567
Letter for every sports team.

523
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.066
The Debate Club
even looked up to him.

524
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.333
What's he doing now?

525
00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:54.734
He is teaching at a high school.

526
00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.000
That's how he and Blair met.

527
00:23:56.133 --> 00:23:57.233
They're both teachers together.

528
00:23:57.367 --> 00:23:58.600
Oh. P.E.?

529
00:23:58.734 --> 00:24:00.166
Special Ed.

530
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.567
Right. Of course.
not just a great athlete.

531
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.767
Great guy.

532
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.633
And he was very picky.

533
00:24:07.767 --> 00:24:10.600
Your sister must
really be something.

534
00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:12.233
Yeah. she is.

535
00:24:18.433 --> 00:24:20.133
He did pun non-stop though.

536
00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:23.233
Oh. I know. I know. she's trying
to wean him off of that.

537
00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:26.467
but I think she might have
to state an intervention.

538
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.500
- Good luck.
- Uh-oh.

539
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.233
There's road work ahead.
but it says we're still

540
00:24:30.367 --> 00:24:32.266
on the fastest route.
but we won't be

541
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.934
if the traffic backs up.

542
00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:35.800
Let's just take this exit here.

543
00:24:35.934 --> 00:24:37.667
No. I think we should
stick with the GPS.

544
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.767
No. as soon as we turn off
it's going to recalculate.

545
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.834
and I don't want to
get in a traffic jam.

546
00:24:42.967 --> 00:24:45.133
This exit.

547
00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:46.500
Alright.

548
00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:02.233
I mean.
a bachelorette pep rally?

549
00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:03.700
Who's idea was that?

550
00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:05.834
Megan.
She put all this together.

551
00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:07.066
with a little help from me.

552
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.500
It seems like a lot of help.

553
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:10.734
Well. she wasn't here. I was.

554
00:25:10.867 --> 00:25:12.400
Well. she should
be calling soon.

555
00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:14.834
So. I can't wait.

556
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.300
It's not recalculating.

557
00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:27.700
Try a different app.

558
00:25:27.834 --> 00:25:29.734
I did. but I'm going
to try another one.

559
00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:31.233
So. we have no idea
where we are.

560
00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:33.467
- We're fine. Alden.
- No. we're not fine.

561
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.533
- We're lost.
- Don't overreact. Okay?

562
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.834
Look. maybe this app right here.

563
00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:40.367
No nothing. Uh-oh. Okay.

564
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.734
I knew I should have
never let you convince me

565
00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:43.367
to get off the highway.

566
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.633
Since when have I ever talked
you into doing anything?

567
00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:46.233
I knew it was a bad idea.

568
00:25:46.367 --> 00:25:48.500
How was I supposed to know
there'd be a dead zone?

569
00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:50.367
It said we were on
the fastest route.

570
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.033
Well. sometimes GPS. they lie.

571
00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.133
Yeah. and sometimes
they don't work!

572
00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:00.233
Are you okay? Are you alright?

573
00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:02.166
Yeah. I'm fine.
It just came out of nowhere.

574
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.033
You sure?

575
00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:07.533
Yeah. I'm fine.

576
00:26:22.367 --> 00:26:23.266
Oh. no.

577
00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:29.066

578
00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:45.500
Well. at least
we have our signal back.

579
00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:47.967
Is AAA on the way?

580
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.500
Looks like it.

581
00:26:49.633 --> 00:26:50.767
How much longer?

582
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.166
it's hard to say.

583
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.633
and I'm going to
shut my phone off soon.

584
00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:55.266

Too much hopping around

585
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.600

586
00:26:56.734 --> 00:26:58.000

turn that thing off.

call in my toast.

pajamas and warm socks.

were about the same size.

some snacks and drinks

695
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.300

all settled. okay?

696
00:32:19.433 --> 00:32:21.967

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.500

Well. come on.
Let's get you settled.

704
00:32:46.066 --> 00:32:47.166
We're sleeping in a tent.

705
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.667
A tent? This is a real beauty.

706
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.266
Overflow from
the Renaissance Fair.

707
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.000
It's got plenty of room.
you'll see.

708
00:32:53.133 --> 00:32:54.266
We thought that you--

709
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.767
Were empty nesters.

710
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.300
We are. Zadie commandeered
Sarah's room for

711
00:32:58.433 --> 00:32:59.967
a crafting studio.

712
00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:02.934
and I'm using Seth's
to store my LPs.

713
00:33:03.066 --> 00:33:05.533
Vinyl's made a comeback.

714
00:33:05.667 --> 00:33:06.900
Come on.
Let's get this puppy up.

715
00:33:07.033 --> 00:33:09.266
Okay.

716
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.066
I've never put
a tent together before.

717
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.333
Megan: It's easy.

718
00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:13.867
How do you know?

719
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.600
Girl scouts. Ambassador gold.

720
00:33:16.734 --> 00:33:17.934
Impressive.

721
00:33:18.066 --> 00:33:19.867
No idea what that means.

722
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.867
It's scouting highest honor.

723
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.166
I don't want to brag.

724
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.433
Well. that'd be a first.

725
00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:27.867
Hey. Alden. grab a corner.

726
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.567
Yeah.

727
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:05.834
Morning. sweetheart.

728
00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:07.200
Morning. Mom.

729
00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:08.900
Oh. what time did Megan
get in last night?

730
00:34:09.033 --> 00:34:10.166
I didn't hear come in.

731
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.033
She didn't. Car trouble.

732
00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:13.533
Oh. no.

733
00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:16.834
They spent the night in
a town called Mackenzie.

734
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:18.467
Where's that?

735
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.400
According to GPS.
the middle of nowhere.

736
00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:23.000
What kind of car trouble?

737
00:34:23.133 --> 00:34:24.467
I don't know.

738
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.867
but the mechanic said it
would be easy to fix.

739
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.734
So. she'll be here in time
for the rehearsal tonight.

740
00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.266
I'm sure she will.

741
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.233
Entereth!

742
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.867
Good morrow. gentlefolk.

743
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.500
How sleepest thou?

744
00:34:54.633 --> 00:34:56.066
Fair.

745
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.000
To middling.

746
00:34:58.133 --> 00:34:59.400
Oh. no.

747
00:34:59.533 --> 00:35:01.400
Was the tent uncomfortable?

748
00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:02.967
No. the tank was great.

749
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.200
It just turns out
somebody snores.

750
00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:07.533
- Everybody snores.
- I don't snore.

751
00:35:07.667 --> 00:35:09.066
- Oh. yeah. you do.
- No. I don't.

752
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.533
- Yes. you do.
- Are you hungry?

753
00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:13.700
Yes.

754
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.133
Thank you. Zadie.

755
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.800
Oh. this looks so delicious.

756
00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:19.533
Thank you so much.

757
00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:21.433
It's Renaissance Day.
So we try to eat as they did.

758
00:35:21.567 --> 00:35:24.200
Oh. Great outfits.

759
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.367
Oh. Mackenzie.

760
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.033
It's a Scottish
Renaissance Fair.

761
00:35:29.166 --> 00:35:30.800
Well-observed. Milady.

762
00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:33.533
Oh. can I borrow
a phone charger?

763
00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:35.734
Phones almost out of juice.

764
00:35:39.834 --> 00:35:42.100
Not today. milord.

765
00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:43.367
We're off the grid.

766
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.033
Yes.

767
00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:46.900
Oh. is there a power outage?

768
00:35:47.033 --> 00:35:49.600
Oh. no. Milady. It's voluntary.

769
00:35:49.734 --> 00:35:52.400
We don't just
dresseth as they did.

770
00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:55.367
we liveth as they did.

771
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.633
- No electronics.
- No.

772
00:35:56.767 --> 00:35:57.967
- No cell phones. Nope.
- No.

773
00:35:59.767 --> 00:36:03.834
Woo. that seems like
a very interesting challenge.

774
00:36:03.967 --> 00:36:06.266
So. I guess I'll just
charge it when we get to town

775
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.500
while you're fixing our car.

776
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.700
Nay. milord. the whole town is

777
00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:15.266
offeth the grideth today.

778
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.633
And thy carriage will
not be fixeth 'til tomorrow.

779
00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:22.166
Wait. what?

780
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.934
Did you just say tomorrow?

781
00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:26.767
There being
no motorized carriages

782
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.166
in what is our Renaissance

783
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.467
one can't very well fixeth one.

784
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.100
Didn't think to
mention that last night?

785
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:37.200
Well. we did not want
to disturbeth your sleep.

786
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.500
This is a disaster.
an absolute disaster.

787
00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:50.867
The nearest town is
about 20 miles away.

788
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.500
We can walk there.
We'll find another car.

789
00:36:52.633 --> 00:36:55.700
I can't walk 20 miles in
a pair of heels or slippers.

790
00:36:55.834 --> 00:36:57.867
I need more comfortable shoes.

791
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.967
Did they have comfortable
shoes in the Renaissance.

792
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.233
Only I don't know how
we're going to buy a new car.

793
00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:04.066
because I maxed out
my credit card on the SUV

794
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.367
and you lost her phone
and your purse.

795
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.367
Please do not remind me.

796
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.000
Wait. maybe we could
hire someone there

797
00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.500
to drive us to Wichita.

798
00:37:11.633 --> 00:37:14.166
Maybe. but again. no money.

799
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.000
Why does this
keep on happening to us?

800
00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:21.000
Me thinketh the universe
is aligned against us.

801
00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:26.033
Or maybe...

802
00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:29.033
Or maybe what?

803
00:37:30.734 --> 00:37:32.166
They're trying to
tell us something.

804
00:37:35.834 --> 00:37:37.200
The stars?

805
00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:41.533
Okay. laugh at me all you want
and I know you will

806
00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:44.433
but Fun For All is not
just a business for me.

807
00:37:44.567 --> 00:37:45.834
It is my passion.

808
00:37:45.967 --> 00:37:47.734
So is Novelties R Us for me.

809
00:37:47.867 --> 00:37:50.233
Yeah. but. Alden. I really
believe in what I'm doing.

810
00:37:50.367 --> 00:37:51.900
Providing the world
with whoopee cushions

811
00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:53.667
and exploding fountain pens.

812
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.033
Actually. yeah.

813
00:37:56.166 --> 00:37:58.000
And don't get me wrong.
I love that thing. I really do.

814
00:37:58.133 --> 00:37:59.767
but in about five minutes
it's gonna lose juice.

815
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.900
and I'm going to feel
completely untethered.

816
00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:08.467
And that is my point.

817
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.066
That we're too wired in.

818
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.000
That people don't take
the time to slow down anymore.

819
00:38:17.266 --> 00:38:21.000
We're always looking forward.
which of course you have to do.

820
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.433
but sometimes...

821
00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.667
...you got to look back.

822
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.767
And Novelties R Us
and Fun For All

823
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.166
gives people
the chance to do that.

824
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.433
Yes.

825
00:38:32.567 --> 00:38:35.800
To feel like kids again.

826
00:38:35.934 --> 00:38:39.100
Kids in a simpler.
less frenetic time.

827
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:42.066
When people appreciated...

828
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.400
The verities.

829
00:38:44.734 --> 00:38:46.834
Okay. I'm not laughing.

830
00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:49.734
Alden. think about it.

831
00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:52.800
This whole crazy trip

832
00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:55.000
is putting us to the test.

833
00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:56.767
giving us a chance
to walk our walk

834
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.266
and talk our talk.

835
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.633
So. why don't we give into it

836
00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:04.200
and spend the day?

837
00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:07.000
Seriously?

838
00:39:07.133 --> 00:39:09.567
Yeah. Charlie said we'd be out
of here first thing tomorrow.

839
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.233
So. that gives me plenty of
time to get back to Wichita.

840
00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:15.467
to be the maid of honor.
an unrehearsed one.

841
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.800
but how hard can that be?

842
00:39:17.934 --> 00:39:20.900
Besides. by the time
we get to the next town.

843
00:39:21.033 --> 00:39:23.500
assuming we can even get a car.

844
00:39:23.633 --> 00:39:25.700
I'm going to miss
the rehearsal anyway.

845
00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:28.734
And I could be there today
to help my mom and my brother

846
00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.367
and my cousins prep
for the big barbecue.

847
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.667
but do they really
need me for that?

848
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.567
I don't know.
it could be kind of...

849
00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:40.333
...fun?

850
00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:42.166
So. what do you say?

851
00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:46.667
I say....

852
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.900
...a very good day to thee. Renaissance.

853
00:39:51.033 --> 00:39:54.133
Ooh!

854
00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:56.533
No. I don't think they did
that five hundred years ago.

855
00:39:56.667 --> 00:39:58.066
- Probably right.
- Okay.

856
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.333
I need to use that phone.
I have to call home.

857
00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:01.000
and let them know what is up.

858
00:40:01.133 --> 00:40:02.500
So do I.

859
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.233
Damsels in distress first.

860
00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:07.166
Wait. who said
that I'm a damsel?

861
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.400
Fine. I'm making my call first.

862
00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.000
That's okay. Thank you.

863
00:40:14.033 --> 00:40:15.467
Just give me like five minutes.

864
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.800
Five minutes?

865
00:40:23.367 --> 00:40:25.500
These boots are
amazingly comfortable.

866
00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:27.066
So's the kilt.

867
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.567
No wonder you guys
wear these things.

868
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.500
We call it a skirt.

869
00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:43.834
Wow. this is amazing.

870
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.800
Check out the band.

871
00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:00.467
Somebody has an admirer.

872
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.200
Whatever dost thou mean?

873
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.934
Thou art shameless.

874
00:41:04.066 --> 00:41:05.600
Welcometh.

875
00:41:05.734 --> 00:41:10.233
Oh. don't you two
looketh right at home!

876
00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.800
Thank you for the clothing.

877
00:41:11.934 --> 00:41:13.900
Charlie:
You are crushing that kilt.

878
00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:17.133
Crushing. Charles?
I faileth to understand.

879
00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:19.233
Crusheth.

880
00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:22.200
Who are your new friends. Mayor?

881
00:41:22.333 --> 00:41:23.433

Ceremonial title.

00:41:28.233 --> 00:41:30.233
Co-equal remuneration.

885
00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:31.467
Don't you believe it.

886
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.133
He rules us down
with an iron hand.

887
00:41:34.266 --> 00:41:35.533

Anon!

919
00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:43.533
That was a little nervy.

920
00:42:43.667 --> 00:42:44.800
What was?

921
00:42:44.934 --> 00:42:47.033
The fiddler.
pitching woo like that.

922
00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:48.800
"Pitching woo."
is that what we're calling it?

923
00:42:48.934 --> 00:42:50.667
You didn't seem to
mind it one bit.

924
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.500
I guess I didn't.

925
00:42:52.633 --> 00:42:54.533
For all he knew
we could have been a couple.

926
00:42:54.667 --> 00:42:57.467
You. me. a couple? Please.

927
00:43:18.734 --> 00:43:20.166
It's really pretty.

928
00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:29.633
Is that...

929
00:43:29.767 --> 00:43:32.300
Yup. that's Will.

930
00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:34.200
The best man.

931
00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:35.467
Wow.

932
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.166
I know. Big-time wow.

933
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.433
I'm happy you're here. though.

934
00:43:38.567 --> 00:43:39.667
- Hey.
- Blair: Hey.

935
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.133
Still no Megan?

936
00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:42.967
No. She's not going to
make it until tomorrow.

937
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.367
But Della is going
to fill in for now.

938
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.333
Will. meet your
maid of honor for the day.

939
00:43:47.467 --> 00:43:50.367
Pleasure to meet you. Della.

940
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.800
You. too.

941
00:43:53.934 --> 00:43:55.967
Looks like she means it. Will.

942
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.500
In fact. she looks
downright Dell-lighted.

943
00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:01.700
Jack.

944
00:44:01.834 --> 00:44:02.934
That's good. right?

945
00:44:03.066 --> 00:44:04.367
- Jack.
- Babe.

946
00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:15.266
This is really cool.

947
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.066
I know not what thoust
mean by "cool." Milady.

948
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.567
but thank you.

949
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.900
You made this?

950
00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.533
Yeah. I carve them
and I do the mechanics

951
00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:26.066
and Zadie paints them.

952
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.400
I have a business
that sells toys like these.

953
00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:30.367
So. do I.
It's not the same as these.

954
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.100
These are really special.

955
00:44:32.233 --> 00:44:33.834
If you're ever interested
in selling to a wider market--

956
00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:36.333
Both: My company would be
the perfect partner for you.

957
00:44:38.567 --> 00:44:39.900
I know not of that.

958
00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:42.166
I enjoyeth making them
for family and friends.

959
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.033
Yet we sell at them to any
old anybody who's interested.

960
00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:48.200
So maybe we would like
to hear about your company.

961
00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:50.400
Both: Companies.

962
00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:53.000
Companies. Submiteth your proposals

963
00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:54.533
and we'll see
who's we like better.

964
00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:55.533
Don't worry.

965
00:44:55.667 --> 00:44:56.767
We shalleth.

966
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.633
May the best proposal winneth.

967
00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:05.834
Wow.

968
00:45:05.967 --> 00:45:08.000
Fantastic. Whoa.

969
00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:09.567
Should bring some of
this home to my dad.

970
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.166
He loves apple cider.

971
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.800
Tell me about your dad.

972
00:45:13.934 --> 00:45:15.400
You said he's retiring.

973
00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:18.667
Yeah. he's a typesetter.
he's an artist.

974
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.100
Loves his work.

975
00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:23.166
So why is he retiring?

976
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.100
Because he loves golf and tennis
and rock climbing more.

977
00:45:26.734 --> 00:45:29.166
Your dad is a jock?

978
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.934
Yeah. when it comes
to my brothers and me.

979
00:45:31.066 --> 00:45:32.400
not an athlete in the bunch.

980
00:45:32.533 --> 00:45:34.934
I tried Little League.
the only position I was

981
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.500
suited for was left out.

982
00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:39.934
Although I will say
when I was eight years old.

983
00:45:40.066 --> 00:45:41.700
I killed in ballroom dancing.

984
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.900
How about you?
What's your dad like?

985
00:45:46.033 --> 00:45:50.500
He passed away
about two years ago.

986
00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:52.300
I'm so sorry.

987
00:45:52.433 --> 00:45:55.400
Thanks. Just makes
Blair's wedding

988
00:45:55.533 --> 00:45:57.667
all that more important.

989
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.400
It's the first big family event
since we lost him.

990
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.867
Ooh.

991
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.066
Very athletic.

992
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.533
Yeah. I don't see a debate
platform or chess tournament.

993
00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.033
I think we're in trouble.

994
00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:14.834
We? Captain of
the volleyball and track team.

995
00:46:14.967 --> 00:46:16.233
Of course you were.

996
00:46:23.367 --> 00:46:25.667
How would your boyfriend in
Seattle feel if he knew you were

997
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.066
making eyes at
a Mackenzie Minstrel?

998
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.333
I am not making eyes.
and no. there's no boyfriend.

999
00:46:31.467 --> 00:46:34.533
So. the minstrel has a chance.

1000
00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:37.300
Well. I haven't met Will yet.

1001
00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:38.734
Who's Will?

1002
00:46:38.867 --> 00:46:40.533
Jack's best man.

1003
00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:42.800
Apparently we're perfect
for each other.

1004
00:49:12.734 --> 00:49:14.133
Sorry!

1005
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.834
Art thou in pain. good sir?

1006
00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:33.200
Yes. used muscles
I didn't know I had.

1007
00:49:33.333 --> 00:49:35.266
Aye. in a Renaissance.
we worketh hard

1008
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.500
and we playeth it hard.

1009
00:49:37.633 --> 00:49:39.867
Clearly I'm not equipeth
for these times.

1010
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.533
Well. uh.
I doth not knoweth that.

1011
00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:44.367
While the real men
huntereth and gathereth.

1012
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.033
I prefereth to stayeth
at home and readeth.

1013
00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:50.166
Much like our beloved
William Shakespeare.

1014
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.500
He was also a brilliant actor.
successful entrepreneur.

1015
00:49:52.633 --> 00:49:54.667
and a formidable wrestler.

1016
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.066
I did a report on him
when I was in seventh grade.

1017
00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.367
But tis his intelligence
that attracteth the damsels.

1018
00:50:06.633 --> 00:50:09.834
Megan claimeth
to not be a damsel.

1019
00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:12.533
Be that as it may.

1020
00:50:12.667 --> 00:50:16.367
even in these times.
a lady knoweth how to. well.

1021
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.633
whet a man's interest by paying
attention to someone else.

1022
00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:23.800
Are we having
a teachable moment here. guys?

1023
00:50:25.233 --> 00:50:26.367
"Teachable moment?"

1024
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.100
Why. whatever dost thou meaneth?

1025
00:50:32.533 --> 00:50:33.767
Excuse me.

1026
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.200
I'm sorry about your foot.

1027
00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:12.567
I just got to face it.

1028
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.033
Renaissance is not my jam.

1029
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.867
Ah. what a grand day.
fellow Mackenzians.

1030
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.667
It's an honor
to be in Mackenzie

1031
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.700
and to stand in the same
place that my forebears did

1032
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:28.333
when they founded this town.

1033
00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:32.100
Sixth generation.

1034
00:51:32.233 --> 00:51:34.834
And they would have
loved this annual fair

1035
00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.934
and they'd want to thank ye
all for coming from near and far

1036
00:51:38.066 --> 00:51:40.000
including our
very special guests.

1037
00:51:41.633 --> 00:51:43.867
Yes. it's a grand day. indeed.

1038
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.433
but all grand days must end.

1039
00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:50.567
and the Mackenzie Minstrels will
help us bid the past goodbye

1040
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.834
with a lovely
16th century waltz.

1041
00:51:53.967 --> 00:51:55.333
Valorous night. good townfolk.

1042
00:51:55.467 --> 00:51:58.567
Walketh home safely.

1043
00:52:00.767 --> 00:52:03.300
Did he say-- The waltz!

1044
00:52:03.433 --> 00:52:05.166
I can do that!

1045
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.633
Second grade ballroom dancing.

1046
00:52:06.767 --> 00:52:08.166
Listen. I don't know
how to waltz. I don't--

1047
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.433
It's okay.
Just. uh. follow my lead.

1048
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:12.767
Put your hand on my shoulder.

1049
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.400
Like that.

1050
00:52:19.633 --> 00:52:20.767
Ready?

1051
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.467
I think so.

1052
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.834
One. two three. That's okay.

1053
00:52:31.467 --> 00:52:33.033
There you go.

1054
00:53:30.867 --> 00:53:32.300
As far as rehearsal dinners go.

1055
00:53:32.433 --> 00:53:34.033
I'd say that was
a darn good one.

1056
00:53:34.166 --> 00:53:36.066
It was the best one
of mine I've ever been to.

1057
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Somebody's hitting it off.

1058
00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:42.700
Will told me
he's completely smitten.

1059
00:53:42.834 --> 00:53:43.967
Yeah. as well he should be.

1060
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.200
I mean. she's a doll.

1061
00:53:45.333 --> 00:53:47.667
I always thought so.

1062
00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.533
But I don't think she has.

1063
00:53:50.667 --> 00:53:52.166
I love seeing
her shine like this.

1064
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.233
Insightful. empathetic. kind.

1065
00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:59.567
I mean. I could really
go for a guy like you.

1066
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.400
Don't.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1067
00:54:02.533 --> 00:54:04.033
She's a very lucky woman.

1068
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.467
Not as lucky as I am.

1069
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.300
Okay. buster. That's it.

1070
00:54:13.433 --> 00:54:15.934
You're not seeing me again until
you're on that altar tomorrow.

1071
00:54:16.066 --> 00:54:20.200
Not true. I'll be seeing you
constantly right here.

1072
00:54:20.333 --> 00:54:22.033
Hey.

1073
00:54:22.166 --> 00:54:24.100
Aren't you forgetting something?

1074
00:54:24.233 --> 00:54:28.367
Sorry. I'd stay
and "punnel" you with yolks.

1075
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.967
but. alas. I must make
like autumn and leaf.

1076
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.033
That's my guy.

1077
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:35.567
Oh!

1078
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.967
Excuse me!

1079
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.066
Ah. enough. Enough.

1080
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.300
Oh. I thought
you were enjoying it.

1081
00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:45.934
No. I was I'm just so exhausted.

1082
00:54:46.066 --> 00:54:47.700
Ah. right.

1083
00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:51.100
Because winning race after race
makes you really drained. right?

1084
00:54:51.233 --> 00:54:52.633
Don't forget quoits.

1085
00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:54.100
How could I?

1086
00:54:54.233 --> 00:54:55.934
Surprised they didn't
throw me in the pillory

1087
00:54:56.066 --> 00:54:58.066
for attempted assault
with a deadly weapon.

1088
00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:06.200
I had a lot of fun today.
I'm glad we stayed.

1089
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:08.300
Yeah. me too.

1090
00:55:08.433 --> 00:55:10.467
No. you did not.
Not until the waltz.

1091
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.867
I mean.
you were completely miserable.

1092
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.633
You lost every game.

1093
00:55:13.767 --> 00:55:15.266
Okay. fine.
Yeah. I was miserable.

1094
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.700
but not because you beat me
at every single game.

1095
00:55:22.967 --> 00:55:24.433
Like ducks it wasn't.

1096
00:55:24.567 --> 00:55:26.033
Who says "like ducks?"

1097
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.200
Hey. where are you going?

1098
00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:31.800
Charlie and Zadie's
place is this way noted.

1099
00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:33.700
- No. it isn't.
- Yes. it is.

1100
00:55:33.834 --> 00:55:35.834
- Nope.
- Yes.

1101
00:55:35.967 --> 00:55:39.233
Fine. suit yourself.
but I'm going to go this way.

1102
00:55:49.967 --> 00:55:52.166
A man who admits he's lost.

1103
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.533
How refreshing.

1104
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.567
Okay. say it.

1105
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.834
Say what?

1106
00:56:03.967 --> 00:56:05.066
I told you so.

1107
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.867
What kind of
a person would say that?

1108
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.166
An olden kind of person?

1109
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.533
Megan Miller.
you don't know me at all.

1110
00:56:13.834 --> 00:56:15.367
Let's get an aerial view.

1111
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:18.433
What? Not inspired to climb?

1112
00:56:18.567 --> 00:56:20.834
I'm wearing a very long skirt.

1113
00:56:20.967 --> 00:56:23.000
I'm wearing a kilt.

1114
00:56:23.133 --> 00:56:24.500
Come on.

1115
00:56:25.867 --> 00:56:27.767
Alright.

1116
00:56:38.834 --> 00:56:40.200
Hey.

1117
00:56:42.133 --> 00:56:43.667
Are you ready for tomorrow?

1118
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.200
Scooch over.

1119
00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:48.767
Sometimes I think
I've been ready for tomorrow

1120
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.233
my whole life.

1121
00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:53.734
Here.

1122
00:56:53.867 --> 00:56:58.033
I remember
my wedding day so vividly.

1123
00:56:58.166 --> 00:57:00.633
It was the happiest day
of my life.

1124
00:57:00.767 --> 00:57:03.133
until I held Megan in my arms.

1125
00:57:03.266 --> 00:57:04.667
then you.

1126
00:57:08.867 --> 00:57:10.967
What was your secret. Mom?

1127
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.667
You and Dad. you guys.
you made happy seem so easy.

1128
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.300
Oh. it was all
smoke and mirrors.

1129
00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.066
No. it wasn't.

1130
00:57:21.633 --> 00:57:23.900
Well. I don't know. I--

1131
00:57:24.033 --> 00:57:26.300
I really don't only that

1132
00:57:26.433 --> 00:57:28.834
every day I'd wake up
and tell myself

1133
00:57:28.967 --> 00:57:31.100
to make this day
the best one yet.

1134
00:57:31.233 --> 00:57:34.166
No matter what came at me.

1135
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.533
Your dad did the same.

1136
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.734
Still can't believe that he's
not going to be there tomorrow.

1137
00:57:41.867 --> 00:57:43.266
Oh. sweetheart. He will.

1138
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.367
Megan is going to look so
pretty in that dress tomorrow.

1139
00:57:51.633 --> 00:57:53.300
If she gets here.

1140
00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:54.667
She will.

1141
00:58:03.767 --> 00:58:06.266
Maybe it's a mirage.

1142
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.467
Maybe the whole town is.

1143
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.767
Like Brigadoon.

1144
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.600
It only appears
every hundred years.

1145
00:58:12.734 --> 00:58:15.333
And then dissolves
into the mist again.

1146
00:58:15.467 --> 00:58:18.000
Or maybe we're just
good and lost.

1147
00:58:18.133 --> 00:58:19.400
I'll put my money on that one.

1148
00:58:20.734 --> 00:58:22.400
Although...

1149
00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:27.066
It's a darn nice
place to be lost in.

1150
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.667
Copy that.

1151
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.000
What did you mean earlier
when you said that it wasn't me

1152
00:58:45.133 --> 00:58:48.100
beating you that
made you miserable?

1153
00:58:50.734 --> 00:58:52.967
Really?

1154
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.567
You need me to say it?

1155
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.567
Yeah.

1156
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.500
I was jealous.

1157
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.200
Jealous?

1158
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:06.934
Of you and Franklin.

1159
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.900
I kind of thought
that's what it was.

1160
00:59:14.033 --> 00:59:16.066
Okay. but tell me something.

1161
00:59:17.767 --> 00:59:19.734
Was there not a part
of you that was...

1162
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.767
...trying to make me jealous?

1163
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:26.667
I guess I was.

1164
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.400
What's that all about?

1165
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.133
Is that a serious question?

1166
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.767
Megan. come on.

1167
00:59:41.367 --> 00:59:42.800
In high school...

1168
00:59:44.834 --> 00:59:46.300
...I had a huge crush on you.

1169
00:59:48.367 --> 00:59:49.500
You did?

1170
00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:52.400
Yeah. every debate.

1171
00:59:52.533 --> 00:59:55.000
every prep squad rally.

1172
00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:58.300
Every time our schools
were facing off. I. uh--

1173
01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.934
I hoped you'd be there.

1174
01:00:06.467 --> 01:00:07.834
Wow.

1175
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.967
How come you never
asked me out then?

1176
01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:16.333
Like you would have
said yes.

1177
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.834
I think I would have.

1178
01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:24.166
Really?

1179
01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.734
Yeah. I mean.
you were only annoying.

1180
01:00:26.867 --> 01:00:28.400
because you were good at
absolutely everything.

1181
01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:29.800
but...

1182
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.834
I always thought you were
kinda cool.

1183
01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.200
Wow.

1184
01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:44.734
But that was
in high school.

1185
01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:46.200
- Alden: Yeah.
- Yeah.

1186
01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:47.800
Alden: Right. right.

1187
01:00:47.934 --> 01:00:51.300
So. why would I try and make you
jealous now?

1188
01:00:51.433 --> 01:00:55.633
Yeah. why would you?

1189
01:00:55.767 --> 01:00:58.233
But you were.

1190
01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:00.567
And I was.

1191
01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.400
Guess we slept here.

1192
01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:46.867
Alden: Yep.

1193
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.600
Wait...

1194
01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:52.867
Oh. I was gonna surprise you
with it when we got to Wichita.

1195
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.133
but... it got a little cold
last night.

1196
01:01:57.266 --> 01:01:59.433
- Where did you get it?
- The fair.

1197
01:01:59.567 --> 01:02:01.867
One of the craft tables.

1198
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.800
It's not as perfect as the one
you wore to the prom.

1199
01:02:04.934 --> 01:02:08.266
but... I figure. it's yours now.
and Blair can borrow it.

1200
01:02:10.266 --> 01:02:11.467
Alden.

1201
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.800
Oh. thank you.

1202
01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:22.600
Guess what.

1203
01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:26.200
What?

1204
01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.266
We couldn't see it
in the dark.

1205
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.667
The lights were off.
they were off the grid.

1206
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.300
So. direction-wise.
I was right.

1207
01:02:34.433 --> 01:02:36.100
You usually are.

1208
01:02:39.266 --> 01:02:40.266
Shall we?

1209
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.400
We shall.

1210
01:02:52.433 --> 01:02:54.433
There you are.
Good morning.

1211
01:02:54.567 --> 01:02:56.667
I was just about to come
wake you up.

1212
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.500
I washed
and dried your clothes.

1213
01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:00.500
Oh. Zadie.

1214
01:03:00.633 --> 01:03:02.367
So. why don't you have some
nice breakfast.

1215
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.266
and then you can go
and freshen up.

1216
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.233
Charlie is in the garage.
working on your car.

1217
01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:08.533
Thank you so much.

1218
01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:09.867
You guys are the best.

1219
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.834
And I will be in touch
real soon

1220
01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:16.533
with a proposal
for those toys.

1221
01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:18.000
- So will I.
- Mmm.

1222
01:03:18.133 --> 01:03:21.100
Well. uh.
we got a wee problem.

1223
01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:22.867
Oh no.

1224
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.734
I got everything on that. uh.
car. patched up just fine.

1225
01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:29.567
and then I went to replace
the busted serpentine belt.

1226
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.500
and um... well.
I don't have the right size.

1227
01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.166
Clean out of stock.

1228
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.166
I don't know what
a serpentine belt is.

1229
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.734
- Neither do I.
- Do we need one.

1230
01:03:37.867 --> 01:03:39.400
Well if you wanna drive
the car. you do.

1231
01:03:39.533 --> 01:03:41.066
Alden:
How soon can you get one?

1232
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.567
Ooh. Tomorrow?

1233
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.033
No!

1234
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:48.166
Alden and Megan's Reverie in
Renaissanceville ends now!

1235
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.700
Charlie. we are going
to Wichita.

1236
01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:54.500
and if that car is not
gonna get us there.

1237
01:03:54.633 --> 01:03:56.734
you better help find
a vehicle that will.

1238
01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.166
Like. immediately.

1239
01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.934
Uh-- Ah...

1240
01:04:00.133 --> 01:04:03.066
Well. I suppose you could take
the tow truck.

1241
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.300
It's kinda pokey.

1242
01:04:04.433 --> 01:04:06.066
It's just a little pokey. though.

1243
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.767
Okay. in 20 miles.
there's a turn-off

1244
01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.433
that'll take us to
the interstate.

1245
01:04:28.567 --> 01:04:30.934
Oh. this thing makes that van
feel like a Ferrari.

1246
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.400
Oh. what?
You have got to be kidding me.

1247
01:04:40.533 --> 01:04:44.266
What? Are we being pulled over
because we're driving too slow?

1248
01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:53.767
Whatever we did.

1249
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.367
let's hope they write tickets
around here fast.

1250
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.367
Fat chance.

1251
01:04:59.867 --> 01:05:02.300
Here he comes.

1252
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.467
- Franklin?
- Is this your vehicle. Miss?

1253
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.033
Uh. no.
It's Charlie's.

1254
01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:09.300
And where are you
headed today?

1255
01:05:09.433 --> 01:05:10.600
Wichita.

1256
01:05:10.734 --> 01:05:12.367
Are you travelin' there
with her. sir?

1257
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.166
What's this
all about. Franklin?

1258
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.033
Stay in the vehicle. both of
you. Hands where I can see them.

1259
01:05:17.166 --> 01:05:19.633
Megan: Wha...

1260
01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:25.133
- What did we do?
- I don't know.

1261
01:05:25.266 --> 01:05:26.934
- Did you know he was a cop?
- No. I had no idea.

1262
01:05:27.066 --> 01:05:29.100
- Well. he seems pretty upset.
- Very upset.

1263
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.533
He's coming. Okay. okay.

1264
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.533
Couple of jugs
of Mackenzie's cider.

1265
01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:53.767
I hear you like it.

1266
01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.433
I had you pretty scared.
didn't I?

1267
01:05:56.567 --> 01:05:58.300
Uh. yeah. you did.

1268
01:05:58.433 --> 01:06:00.266
Franklin:
I just fiddle for fun.

1269
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.700
This is my day job.

1270
01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.700
Ah. well.
you're pretty good at it.

1271
01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.500
Thank you.

1272
01:06:05.633 --> 01:06:08.200
And you may be the single most
uncoordinated human being

1273
01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:11.033
I have ever met...
until you waltz.

1274
01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.500
then you're magic. dude.

1275
01:06:12.633 --> 01:06:15.200
Thank you--
both of you.

1276
01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:17.934
for helping to make yesterday
one of my best days ever.

1277
01:06:18.066 --> 01:06:21.633
Oh. well. it was one of
our best days too.

1278
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.867
Well. I'll let you off with
a warning this time.

1279
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.166
And I hope to see you back here
next year.

1280
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.700
Won't be the same fair
without ya.

1281
01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:35.166
Thanks. Franklin.

1282
01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:40.333
- Brigadoon.
- Oh. yes! Definitely.

1283
01:06:41.633 --> 01:06:42.934
You sure you don't wanna disappear

1284
01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.233
into the mist with him?

1285
01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:47.433
Oh. I'm tempted.
but I think I'm good.

1286
01:06:47.567 --> 01:06:48.700
Alden: All right.

1287
01:06:48.834 --> 01:06:51.700
Let's get out of here.

1288
01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:54.533
Definitely.

1289
01:06:58.467 --> 01:06:59.667
No.

1290
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.667
Ugh! No!

1291
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.567
Come on. you've got to be
kidding me.

1292
01:07:06.633 --> 01:07:07.767
- Come on.
- Come on. pokey!

1293
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.300
Quick. before He changes
His mind.

1294
01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:12.333
Okay.

1295
01:07:37.734 --> 01:07:39.166
They've just hit
the city limits.

1296
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.667
but there's
a lot of traffic.

1297
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.266
So... what do you want
to do?

1298
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.066
Um...

1299
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.400
Let's give her another...
20 minutes.

1300
01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:53.567
And then come be my maid
of honor.

1301
01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.800
Oh. Blair. I can't--

1302
01:07:54.934 --> 01:07:56.967
I will love having you
beside me.

1303
01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.900
and so will Will.

1304
01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:21.100
Oh. sweetheart.
You look glorious.

1305
01:08:22.133 --> 01:08:25.166
Mom. you're crying already!

1306
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.800
Oh. I'll be crying all day.
Get used to it.

1307
01:08:29.467 --> 01:08:30.834
Let's do this.

1308
01:08:47.967 --> 01:08:50.000
Alden: Oh. great.
We're boxed in.

1309
01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:20.200
- Ah!
- Ah!

1310
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:22.066
- We made it!
- It is a miracle.

1311
01:09:29.033 --> 01:09:32.300
So. I was thinking. when
we're back in Seattle...

1312
01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:36.400
Yeah. let's maybe. uh. get
together sometime.

1313
01:09:36.533 --> 01:09:39.066
Yeah. hang out.
or something.

1314
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.000
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

1315
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100
Well. I-- I should be
getting in there.

1316
01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:47.300
Right. yes. Go.

1317
01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.233
Uh. have a great wedding.

1318
01:09:49.367 --> 01:09:51.133
Thanks. you too.
Have a great party.

1319
01:09:51.266 --> 01:09:52.967
Alden: Thanks.

1320
01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:55.934
Don't forget the cider.

1321
01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:58.934
- Yeah. yeah. Oh. thanks.
- There you go.

1322
01:09:59.066 --> 01:10:00.967
And thank you again.

1323
01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.500
Okay. bye.

1324
01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:29.867
Okay.

1325
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.600
Oh! Ah. Della.

1326
01:10:32.734 --> 01:10:34.100
Uh. Megan.

1327
01:10:34.233 --> 01:10:36.867
Look at that dress.
You look fantastic.

1328
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.200
Thanks.

1329
01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:39.867
Are you on your way
over there?

1330
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.867
Uh. yeah. they left your mom's
car for you.

1331
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.100
but I-- I can wait.

1332
01:10:43.233 --> 01:10:44.934
Oh. no. no. no.
that's okay.

1333
01:10:45.066 --> 01:10:47.400
You can just go over there.
let them know I am on my way.

1334
01:10:47.533 --> 01:10:48.867
I have no cellphone.

1335
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.734
Oh. right.

1336
01:10:50.867 --> 01:10:52.700
I'll see you over there.
Oh. um. oh...

1337
01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:55.800
I left the invitation
in my luggage.

1338
01:10:55.934 --> 01:10:57.300
What church is it at?

1339
01:10:57.433 --> 01:10:59.300
First Consecrational.

1340
01:10:59.433 --> 01:11:03.533
Right. Okay.
Thank you. Della.

1341
01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.567
Bye.

1342
01:12:04.033 --> 01:12:06.166
Megan!

1343
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.667
I'm such a bad person.
I-- I did such a bad thing.

1344
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.433
Della. what are you talking
about?

1345
01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:16.333
These past few days.
I've felt so captivating and...

1346
01:12:16.467 --> 01:12:19.266
attractive and... fun.

1347
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.567
and... guys don't go for me.

1348
01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.033
you know they don't.

1349
01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:26.767
But Will did. and I know
the minute he sees you

1350
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.166
and walks down
the aisle with you.

1351
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.367
he's gonna forget all about me.
and who can blame him?

1352
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.600
You're so fabulous.

1353
01:12:35.734 --> 01:12:38.667
So. I-- I don't know
what came over me.

1354
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.867
I think I lost my mind for
a minute. And...

1355
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.767
So. you sent me to
the wrong church?

1356
01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:46.834
Yes.

1357
01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:49.033
It's okay. Della.

1358
01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:51.500
Let's get us to the right one.
Come on. I'll follow you.

1359
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:04.166
They're getting a bit antsy
in there.

1360
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.800
Well. I suppose I could get
married with no maid of honor.

1361
01:13:06.934 --> 01:13:08.133
Mom:
Oh. no. no. sweetheart.

1362
01:13:10.467 --> 01:13:14.200
They're here.

1363
01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:16.033
You waited!
Thank you!

1364
01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:18.233
- Blair: Megan!
- Blair!

1365
01:13:18.367 --> 01:13:20.900
You look transcendent.
Hi. Mom.

1366
01:13:21.033 --> 01:13:22.400
Wait. why are
you wearing--

1367
01:13:22.533 --> 01:13:24.166
I'll tell you
about it later.

1368
01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.200
Ah. Will. I'm Megan.
So nice to meet you.

1369
01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:30.533
Best man and maid of honor they
go behind the bridesmaids

1370
01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:31.967
- and groomsmen. right?
- Uh...

1371
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.367
Uh. no. Megan.
You're the maid of honor.

1372
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.367
No time to change it.
Plus. you rehearsed it.

1373
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.800
So. what number bridesmaid
are you?

1374
01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:39.467
Number one.

1375
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.033
And who am I walking with?

1376
01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.266
Mom:
Oh. just one moment!

1377
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.200
Here you go. sweetheart.

1378
01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:50.400
- Thanks. Mom.
- And for you.

1379
01:13:50.533 --> 01:13:51.967
- Thanks. Mom.
- All right.

1380
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.767
Let's get this girl married!

1381
01:13:56.533 --> 01:13:59.133
Wait. hold that thought.

1382
01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:06.233
I don't know.

1383
01:14:06.367 --> 01:14:08.700
Oh. Megan.

1384
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.400
Now you're ready
to get married.

1385
01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:16.600
Thank you.

1386
01:14:16.734 --> 01:14:19.900
Okay.

1387
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.233
Oh. Mom!

1388
01:14:47.433 --> 01:14:48.600
Are you ready?

1389
01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.900
Yes.

1390
01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:56.567
The proverbial "they" say
true love

1391
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.567
can overcome any obstacle.

1392
01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.266
Although. I think snoring comes
pretty close

1393
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.300
to being a deal breaker.
if you ask me.

1394
01:15:05.433 --> 01:15:09.367
Jack and Blair. I don't know
what obstacles

1395
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.166
you had to overcome
for the sake of your love.

1396
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.500
You ever hear
this guy pun?

1397
01:15:14.633 --> 01:15:17.033
Oh. right. Right. yeah.
There's that.

1398
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:18.533
There's that. You do that.

1399
01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.934
Well. okay. one thing. but let's
hope that's it.

1400
01:15:21.066 --> 01:15:23.300
now and forever.

1401
01:15:23.433 --> 01:15:27.233
However. not all love
is romantic.

1402
01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.767
The love between
two sisters

1403
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.667
is a pretty powerful one too.

1404
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.467
It is.

1405
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.667
Ugh! And let me tell you.

1406
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.867
the obstacles I had to get
through to get to this sister!

1407
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.133
Okay. here I go.

1408
01:15:45.266 --> 01:15:47.867
Um. an airport strike...

1409
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.300
a stolen car. stolen luggage.
stolen phone!

1410
01:15:52.433 --> 01:15:54.500
Which was the cruelest
of them all.

1411
01:15:56.133 --> 01:15:58.500
Oh. right. a van in a ditch...

1412
01:15:58.633 --> 01:16:02.266
um. a day without electricity
or internet--

1413
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.200
which is not as gnarly
as you think.

1414
01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:07.600
An undersized
serpentine belt--

1415
01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:10.233
which. I still don't know that
that is.

1416
01:16:10.367 --> 01:16:13.834
A tow truck going at the speed
of snail.

1417
01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:16.200
and a trip to
the wrong church!

1418
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.667
Don't worry about it.

1419
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.367
Now. I could have
just stayed home.

1420
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.900
and watched
the countless uploads

1421
01:16:25.033 --> 01:16:26.433
you guys are all gonna post
of this wedding--

1422
01:16:26.567 --> 01:16:28.767
and don't tell me
you're not going to.

1423
01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:33.000
But not be there...

1424
01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:35.500
for my sister's biggest day?

1425
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:39.166
I can't imagine
anything sadder.

1426
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.200
because this sister

1427
01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:46.900
has been
the brightest star in my sky

1428
01:16:47.033 --> 01:16:50.700
since as long
as I can remember.

1429
01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:52.700
Blair. to see you so beautiful...

1430
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.066
...with the rightest guy in
the world for you.

1431
01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.166
there is no obstacle that would
have stopped me

1432
01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.233
from being here today.

1433
01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:05.500
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1434
01:17:05.633 --> 01:17:09.934
So. please raise your glass in
helping me toast

1435
01:17:10.066 --> 01:17:14.066
to the couple
of this hour.

1436
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.967
and every hour.

1437
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.000
Jack and Blair Evans.

1438
01:17:19.133 --> 01:17:20.266
Cheers.

1439
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.100
I needed that after my day...

1440
01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:30.400

1452
01:18:01.867 --> 01:18:03.400
Forty-eight hours joined at
the hip with Alden Brown.

I mean. he must
have driven you crazy.

- No.

He wasn't as bad
as I thought he was.

1457
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.467
Oh. Well. I'm glad
to hear that.

1458

I knew it.

1473
01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.633

party then?

they didn't need me there.

I needed me
to be there and...

I needed you to have this.

1479
01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:30.133
Top shelf of the family room
just like I thought.

1480
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.900
Oh. wow. You did not need to
bring me this!

1481
01:19:34.033 --> 01:19:37.433
Uh. I have it on good authority
that I did.

1482
01:19:37.567 --> 01:19:39.467
And I also don't have
your number

1483
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.967
or your address
in Seattle.

1484
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.633
Well. you know Fun For All does
have a Contact Me link.

1485
01:19:44.767 --> 01:19:47.066
About that.

1486
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.633
See. I was thinking. you could
submit your proposal

1487
01:19:49.767 --> 01:19:52.133
to Zadie and Charlie.
and I could submit mine.

1488
01:19:52.266 --> 01:19:53.567
Mmm-hmm.

1489
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.800
Would they be any different?

1490
01:19:54.934 --> 01:19:56.300
No. probably not. no.

1491
01:19:56.433 --> 01:20:00.066
So. I was thinking. what if we
just submitted--

1492
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.967
- One proposal.
- Right.

1493
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:04.133
- And then we could--
- Share the business.

1494
01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:06.033
Right. And then we'll do
the same thing with--

1495
01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:07.934
With Consolidated. We can stop
chopping up the market.

1496
01:20:08.066 --> 01:20:09.700
And then we'll just work together.

1497
01:20:09.834 --> 01:20:11.533
Yeah. Why fight to crowd each
other out of the space--

1498
01:20:11.667 --> 01:20:13.066
That we love when
we can just--

1499
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.533
Join forces. We could...

1500
01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:17.200
Own it together.

1501
01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:19.133
Fun Time Novelties.

1502
01:20:19.266 --> 01:20:22.533

1503
01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:24.600
Oh. whatever.

1504
01:20:30.233 --> 01:20:31.934
Um...

1505
01:20:32.066 --> 01:20:35.100
Look. the bottom line is...

1506
01:20:35.233 --> 01:20:39.200
I don't wanna just maybe
call you

1507
01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:42.367
when we get to Seattle

1508
01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.867
and maybe. sort of hang out.

1509
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.567
I want to see you
as soon as I can.

1510
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.467
as soon as you're back.

1511
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.133
properly. like over dinner?

1512
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:01.533
Are you asking me out.
Alden Brown?

1513
01:21:01.667 --> 01:21:03.934
I think I am.
Megan Miller.

1514
01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:07.233
Well. took you
long enough.

1515
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.633
What can I say. girls mature
faster than boys.

1516
01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:13.266
Megan: I think we debated
that proposal.

1517
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.500
Uh. yeah. we did. and I won.
but the data were bogus.

1518
01:21:16.633 --> 01:21:17.900
No doubt.

1519
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.266
Okay. so just
to be clear here.

1520
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.367
We don't hate each other
anymore?

1521
01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:45.700
I'm pretty sure
that we don't.

1522
01:21:48.967 --> 01:21:51.667
Um...

1523
01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.500
I guess I should go back
to my dad's party.

1524
01:21:54.633 --> 01:21:57.867
Oh. Come on.
One more dance?

1525
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.600
I could ask the DJ if he could
play a waltz.

1526
01:22:00.734 --> 01:22:02.600
I don't know.

1527
01:22:02.734 --> 01:22:05.400
I mean. I don't want to steal
Jack and Blair's thunder.

1528
01:22:05.533 --> 01:22:07.734
I think after
all we've been through.

1529
01:22:07.867 --> 01:22:10.867
we deserve to steal
a little bit of it.

1530
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.200
Don't you think?
