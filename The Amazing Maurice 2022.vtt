00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.040
"One day. when he was naughty.

4
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.000
Mr Bunnsy looked over the hedge
into Farmer Fred's field

5
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.080
Mr Bunnsy looked over the hedge
into Farmer Fred's field

6
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.920
and it was full of green lettuces."

7
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.000
"Mr Bunnsy. however.
was not full of lettuces."

8
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.040
"Mr Bunnsy. however.
was not full of lettuces."

9
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.720
"This did not seem fair."

10
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.880
Not fair at all!

11
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.000
So there you go.
Those are the opening words

12
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.520
So there you go.
Those are the opening words

13
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.480
to Mr Bunnsy Has An Adventure.

14
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.000
But that is not the story
you will see.

15
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.680
But that is not the story
you will see.

16
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.920
This. what you're watching right
now. is called a framing device.

17
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.760
a story that wraps around
the main story

18
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.000
like a warm blanket around a baby.

19
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.240
like a warm blanket around a baby.

20
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.000
Steady there. Right!

21
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.520
Now. we have to get
your story started.

22
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.000
And it's not about cute rabbits
wearing clothes. Not at all!

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400
And it's not about cute rabbits
wearing clothes. Not at all!

24
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.200
In fact.

25
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.840
your story

26
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.000
is all about...

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.320
is all about...

28
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.200
Rats!

29
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.280
You've got...

30
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.920
..r-r-rats!

31
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.000
Rats!

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.920
Rats!

33
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.880
# Twitching noses. cunning faces

34
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.600
# Hiding in the strangest places

35
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520
# Always gnawing. clawing. peeking

36
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.000
# Climbing. jumping. squealing.
squeaking

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.480
# Climbing. jumping. squealing.
squeaking

38
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.640
Agh!

39
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.920
Cluck! Cluck!

40
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720
# Greedy for your precious treat

41
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.640
# They lick the crumbs
from off their feet

42
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.000
# They undermine your soil and ground

43
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.560
# They undermine your soil and ground

44
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.360
# Try to catch them. can't be found!

45
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.040
Hey. that cat can talk!

46
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.000
Rats!

47
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.560
Rats!

48
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.400
You've... got... rats!

49
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.280
Rats! Whaaat?!

50
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.880
# Nibbling here. napping there

51
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.000
# They widdle on your tableware

52
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.840
# They widdle on your tableware

53
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.000
# You try to poison.
trap and shoot them

54
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.200
# Race and chase
and stomp and boot them

55
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000
# They leap with marvellous agility

56
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.280
# They leap with marvellous agility

57
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.240
# No beast can match their sheer...

58
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.280
Er... Erm...

59
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.640
..adaptability?

60
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.320
# Rats! Rats!
# You've got multiplying rats!

61
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.480
# You've...
# You've...

62
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.360
# Got rats!
# Got rats!

63
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.000
# Rats! #

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.280
# Rats! #

65
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.240
There really aren't all that many.

66
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.000
You don't need many for a plague.
not if they know their business.

67
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.400
You don't need many for a plague.
not if they know their business.

68
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.760
One rat taking a bath in fresh cream
and widdling in the flour?

69
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.000
Could be a plague all by himself!

70
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.720
Could be a plague all by himself!

71
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.800
A plague?
We're doomed!

72
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.480
I suppose you want us to pay you
to get rid of them!Me?

73
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.000
Just one lone cat? Against all that?

74
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.280
Just one lone cat? Against all that?

75
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.080
Well. I am good. it's true.
but no. no. no. no.

76
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.000
one cat will never do.

77
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.520
one cat will never do.

78
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560
Oh. what. then? What?

79
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600
You need...

80
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.880
..the Piper.

81
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.360
That's not the Pied Piper!

82
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.080
Hm! Not the real one. anyway.

83
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.000
Your saviour has arrived.
Come on. pony up!

84
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.880
Your saviour has arrived.
Come on. pony up!

85
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.640
Oh. it's working!

86
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.920
Yes!

87
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.000
They're leaving! They're leaving!

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.800
They're leaving! They're leaving!

89
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.800
Whoaaa!

90
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.680
Ahhh...

91
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.520
Yay! No more rats!

92
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.000
No more rats! Whoo!

93
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.080
No more rats! Whoo!

94
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.040
Hey! Where did the talking cat go?

95
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Whose brilliant idea was the cliff?

96
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.320
Whose brilliant idea was the cliff?

97
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.840
The swimming
and the water - pfft! - up my nose?

98
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760
Sorry! Sorry!

99
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.000
That was me! Whoa!

100
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.640
That was me! Whoa!

101
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.000
The idea just kind of hit me
and I ran with it!

102
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.000
Ah. that was fun!

103
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.240
Ah. that was fun!

104
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.480
Let's do it again!
Ooh! It did provide dramatic flair!

105
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.000
A climactic end to the affair!

106
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.760
A climactic end to the affair!

107
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.120
Yo! Who thinks Keith here

108
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.040
needs to go for a little swim
himself?

109
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.000
All in favour?Aye!

110
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.920
All in favour?Aye!

111
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.240
Well. that went well!

112
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.080
Says the cat who's perfectly dry.

113
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.000
But look! Cash! Money!

114
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.520
But look! Cash! Money!

115
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.320
Ahem-hem!

116
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.400
That sound always spells trouble.

117
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.000
Ahem! Morris...

118
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.800
Ahem! Morris...

119
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.200
Peaches. Peaches... How many times?
It's "Maurice"!

120
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.080
"Mauriiice."

121
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000
All right. fine. out with it.

122
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.200
All right. fine. out with it.

123
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.840
Well. Morris. Dangerous Beans thinks
we shouldn't live by trickery.

124
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.520
Oh?
Is that what Dangerous Beans thinks?

125
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.000
You know. some think

126
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You know. some think

127
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.040
there's a good deal too much thinking
going on. and I think I agree.

128
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.880
Peaches is right.

129
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.880
With our newfound intelligence
comes a conscience.

130
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.000
We must ask.
"Is it right to trick people?"

131
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We must ask.
"Is it right to trick people?"

132
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.080
But trickery is what humans
are all about!

133
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.880
They're so keen on tricking
each other.

134
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.000
they elect governments
to do it for them!

135
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.280
they elect governments
to do it for them!

136
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.120
But does it feel right?
Ahem! What Dangerous Beans means is.

137
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.000
"Do we really need
to keep doing THIS?"

138
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.040
"Do we really need
to keep doing THIS?"

139
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.880
"Doing this"? Well. of course. no!

140
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.480
In fact. I don't have to be here
at all! I'm a cat. right?

141
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.000
There's no end of things I could
be doing. because people like cats.

142
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.520
There's no end of things I could
be doing. because people like cats.

143
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.000
Instead. I choose to help
a bunch of ungrateful rodents

144
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.680
Instead. I choose to help
a bunch of ungrateful rodents

145
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.840
who are not exactly number one
favourites with humans. Right?

146
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.600
But if I may remind you.

147
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.000
you were the ones who wanted to find
the island paradise.

148
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.880
you were the ones who wanted to find
the island paradise.

149
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.880
Paradise...

150
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.000
Bring forth the sacred book.

151
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.960
Bring forth the sacred book.

152
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.520
Hey. hey. Keith!
Hm?

153
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.800
The sacred book!
Oh. yes. yes! Er... Ahem!

154
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.000
There you go.

155
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.480
There you go.

156
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.000
Ah. this is where we're headed!

157
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.200
Ah. this is where we're headed!

158
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.840
An ideal land.

159
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.840
where animals talk

160
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.000
and live side-by-side with people
in peace!

161
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.880
and live side-by-side with people
in peace!

162
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.240
Oh. look! Animals wearing clothes.

163
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.000
A rabbit who walks on his hind legs
and wears a blue suit.

164
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.720
And there's a rat called Rupert

165
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.200
and a stoat
who goes by the name of Howard.

166
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.480
And Olly the Snake
is a bit of a rascal.

167
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.000
but don't worry. nothing truly bad
ever happens there!

168
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.640
but don't worry. nothing truly bad
ever happens there!

169
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.040
It is paradise!

170
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.320
In the land of Mr Bunnsy.

171
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.000
there are no poisons.
there are no traps!

172
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
there are no poisons.
there are no traps!

173
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.760
None of the animals
eats any of the others.

174
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.000
It IS paradise.

175
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.040
It IS paradise.

176
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.960
We must find this place.
Exactly!

177
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.040
You've been there. right. Morris?

178
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.000
Me? The Amazing Maurice?

179
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.400
Me? The Amazing Maurice?

180
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.160
Er. no. not personally. no. But I've
spoken to many cats who have.

181
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.000
As we all know. it's an island.
A beautiful faraway island.

182
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.680
As we all know. it's an island.
A beautiful faraway island.

183
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.520
And to get to the island.
we need what? Boats. Right?

184
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.000
And to get boats. we need what?
Money. Right?

185
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.560
And to get boats. we need what?
Money. Right?

186
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.520
We have to keep making money.
Understand?

187
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.000
Fine. That's settled. then.

188
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.800
Fine. That's settled. then.

189
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.280
Keith. let's go.Oh!Our next target
is this way.OK. coming!

190
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.560
Oof!

191
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.440
Perhaps... one more town.

192
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.000
Yay!

193
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.560
Yay!

194
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.200
Now. in fact. Morris was lying.

195
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.000
That's the beauty
of the framing device. see?

196
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.080
That's the beauty
of the framing device. see?

197
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.440
I get to tell you stuff about this
story you wouldn't otherwise know.

198
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.840
Like. I can tell you that Morris
never spoke to other cats

199
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.000
because no other cat
could speak back.

200
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.320
because no other cat
could speak back.

201
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.800
Morris was as unique as the rats!

202
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.000
He knew money was important. so he
lied to the rats to make more of it.

203
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
He knew money was important. so he
lied to the rats to make more of it.

204
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.800
In truth.
he was building himself a nest egg

205
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.000
so he could make good
on his deluxe retirement plan.

206
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.200
so he could make good
on his deluxe retirement plan.

207
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.880
And now you know Mr Bunnsy
is important to the story

208
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.720
because the rats believe he is real.

209
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.000
They think they can find a land
where all the animals talk

210
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.720
They think they can find a land
where all the animals talk

211
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.720
and live happily ever after.

212
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.000
"Farmer Fred opened his door

213
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.600
"Farmer Fred opened his door

214
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.480
and saw all the animals
of Furry Bottom waiting for him."

215
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.000
"We can't find Mr Bunnsy!"
..they cried.

216
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.360
"We can't find Mr Bunnsy!"
..they cried.

217
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.320
If that sounds ominous

218
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.240
it's because it's called
foreshadowing.

219
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.000
Which is kind of a promise to you.

220
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.320
Which is kind of a promise to you.

221
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.920
letting you know
that if you keep with the story.

222
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.840
it's going to get...

223
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.000
..ugly. Really ugly!

224
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.160
..ugly. Really ugly!

225
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.960
You. my dear fellows.
are the best rat catchers around

226
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and you've done a great job.
of course you have.

227
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.360
and you've done a great job.
of course you have.

228
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.040
There are no rats
anywhere in the town!

229
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.400
Thank you. Mr Mayor!

230
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.560
That we can see.

231
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.000
Er. what's that?
It's just that.

232
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.080
Er. what's that?
It's just that.

233
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.120
well. the food in the town
continues to...

234
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.320
..disappear!

235
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.000
It's just...

236
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.720
It's just...

237
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.040
..gone.Huh?
Poof!Uh?!

238
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.280
We are in the midst of a famine!

239
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.000
What are you trying to say?
Or. in fact. saying?

240
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.520
What are you trying to say?
Or. in fact. saying?

241
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.840
What I am trying to say.
or at least imply. strongly.

242
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.920
is that there must be a connection!

243
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.120
Connection?

244
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.240
The rats? The food?

245
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.000
It's rather strange. isn't it?

246
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.600
It's rather strange. isn't it?

247
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.880
Talking of strange. that. er.
new fellow in town. your employer.

248
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.000
what's his name. It's. er...?
Boss Man.

249
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.080
what's his name. It's. er...?
Boss Man.

250
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.000
Yes. yes. yes.
Well. with all those clothes

251
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.680
and that scarf and the hat.
I-I can't really see him.

252
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.000
you know. your boss. I mean.

253
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.360
you know. your boss. I mean.

254
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.560
Strange. you say?

255
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.000
Er. not that strange!

256
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.000
Have you considered

257
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.640
Have you considered

258
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.040
that what you have here.

259
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.720
with the missing food.

260
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.000
is a mystery?
Mystery! Oh. yes! That's correct!

261
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.560
is a mystery?
Mystery! Oh. yes! That's correct!

262
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.320
And with the rats gone.
none to be found.

263
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.000
that factor is simply...

264
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.400
that factor is simply...

265
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.480
..unrelated.

266
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.080
Unrelated!

267
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.000
Mm-hm.

268
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.480
Mm-hm.

269
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.080
Always nice to do business with you.

270
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.000
Mr Mayor!

271
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.520
Mr Mayor!

272
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
Mum?
What is it. love?

273
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.880
I'm hungry!

274
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.000
How about we pick leaves from the
ground and make leaf sandwiches?

275
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.280
How about we pick leaves from the
ground and make leaf sandwiches?

276
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.120
With no bread. Just leaves.
And imaginary jam.

277
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.000
Stay low. Quiet as mice.

278
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.400
Stay low. Quiet as mice.

279
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.680
Remember. this is a new town.

280
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.000
There's bound to be new traps
and poisons.

281
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.120
There's bound to be new traps
and poisons.

282
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.040
Allow me.

283
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.000
Why do we wear clothes?
It makes no... sense!

284
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.240
Why do we wear clothes?
It makes no... sense!

285
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.880
Unless we're on stage!

286
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.000
Dangerous Beans says it's civilised.

287
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.760
Dangerous Beans says it's civilised.

288
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.680
And the concept of the belt
is worthy.

289
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.680
You never know
what you're going to need next.

290
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.880
Move on!

291
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.960
All right. let's stop here!

292
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.840
Number Three Platoon - In-Brine.
Sell-By. Sardines and Delicious.

293
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.360
you're on widdling duty.

294
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.000
Go to it!
If I don't hear ladies screaming

295
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.840
Go to it!
If I don't hear ladies screaming

296
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.000
and running out of their kitchens
within ten minutes.

297
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.160
then you're not the rats
I think you are.

298
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.000
Number Two Platoon -
Big Savings. Best Before.

299
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.040
Number Two Platoon -
Big Savings. Best Before.

300
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.000
Special Offer and Do Not Enter.

301
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.680
you're on trap disposal.

302
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.000
Use caution. Never rush. never run.

303
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.640
We don't want to be like
the first mouse. eh?No!

304
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.320
Right! What mouse do we want to
be like?The second mouse!

305
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.000
Because?Because
the second mouse gets the cheese!

306
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.080
Because?Because
the second mouse gets the cheese!

307
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.440
You have a question?

308
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.000
Er. what does the first mouse get?

309
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.760
Er. what does the first mouse get?

310
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.760
The trap. See?

311
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.800
And then the Bone Rat comes for ya!

312
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.000
The Bone... ..Rat?

313
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.160
The Bone... ..Rat?

314
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.160
Mm-mm.

315
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.920
All right! Go! Go! Go!

316
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.000
Keith and Maurice
will be in position soon.

317
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.080
Keith and Maurice
will be in position soon.

318
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.640
You know what
worries me. Dangerous Beans?

319
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.000
What is it that worries you.
Darktan?

320
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.520
What is it that worries you.
Darktan?

321
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.760
There aren't any local rats here.
Normal rats. you know?

322
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.920
Rat tunnels? Yeah.
Rat droppings? In abundance!

323
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.000
But we've seen no actual rats.

324
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.680
But we've seen no actual rats.

325
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.680
A town like this
should be full of 'em.

326
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.440
Hm. It smells. doesn't it?

327
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.400
Yeah. It smells.

328
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.000
It smells like a...

329
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.560
It smells like a...

330
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.400
A mystery.

331
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.000
Hm. It's still all quiet.

332
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.520
Hm. It's still all quiet.

333
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.760
Sounds like the lads
didn't start their plague show yet.

334
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.560
50 cents for every dead rat?

335
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.240
They seem serious.

336
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.360
50 cents! Huh! Must be a rich town.

337
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.000
That's good. That's very good.
It means more money for me. Oh!

338
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.640
That's good. That's very good.
It means more money for me. Oh!

339
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.120
For us! For us. of course!

340
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.440
Yeah. looks like a town
with opportunities.

341
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.000
But have you noticed...

342
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.880
But have you noticed...

343
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.560
..there's no food?!

344
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600
That is odd! For a market town.
Yeah. Especially when you're hungry.

345
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.000
Which is my way of saying.
"I'm really hungry!"

346
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.680
Which is my way of saying.
"I'm really hungry!"

347
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.640
Oh. look. this one's open! Ahem!

348
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.440
Good day to you. sir!

349
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.000
We're looking for... food?

350
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We're looking for... food?

351
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.880
Yes. well. there you go.
Right under your nose.

352
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.000
Oh. Well. I guess. erm.
how much for the...

353
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.320
Oh. Well. I guess. erm.
how much for the...

354
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.720
Too late.Huh?
It's gone.

355
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.600
No. but we're very...
And now we're closed. Sorry!

356
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.200
Have a nice day!

357
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.000
Maurice. what... What do you think?
Maurice?

358
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.280
Maurice. what... What do you think?
Maurice?

359
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.800
Maurice!

360
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.240
Maurice?

361
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.320
Maurice?

362
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.120
Agh! Oof!

363
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.000
It has everything you would
traditionally want in a kitchen.

364
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.320
It has everything you would
traditionally want in a kitchen.

365
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.600
except for something to eat.

366
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.240
Maurice. please. let's go.
before someone...

367
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.000
Quick. scratch me on the head!
There's a girl looking at us.

368
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.960
Quick. scratch me on the head!
There's a girl looking at us.

369
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.400
What?

370
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.000
Who's to say a narrator can't also
appear in the story she's telling?

371
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.320
Who's to say a narrator can't also
appear in the story she's telling?

372
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.600
Did that cat just say something?

373
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.000
Huh? Cats can't talk!
Everybody knows that.

374
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.280
Huh? Cats can't talk!
Everybody knows that.

375
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.520
Ah. I get it.
You brought the cat here

376
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.120
because you know there's a famine
and you're going to sell it.

377
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.000
There's at least two good meals
on those bones.

378
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.280
There's at least two good meals
on those bones.

379
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.640
What? You eat cats here?

380
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.000
Ha! Got you!

381
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.640
Yep. she got ya.
Mm.

382
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.000
Well. there's some milk
that's not gone hard yet.

383
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.680
Well. there's some milk
that's not gone hard yet.

384
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.240
and a couple of fish heads.
That will have to do.

385
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.600
Do? That will be ideal!

386
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.000
But maybe we shouldn't eat your food
if there is so little?

387
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.120
But maybe we shouldn't eat your food
if there is so little?

388
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.400
No. no. no. My father. who happens
to be the mayor. by the way.

389
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.160
says we need to be hospitable.

390
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.720
So tell me your name.

391
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.000
Er. Keith.

392
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.080
Er. Keith.

393
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.560
Oh. that won't do!
No hint of mystery.

394
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.680
It just hints of... Keith!

395
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.000
Are you sure that's your real name?
I don't know. I'm an orphan.

396
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.560
Are you sure that's your real name?
I don't know. I'm an orphan.

397
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.480
Ah. yeah! Mm! That's more like it.
A mysterious past.

398
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.480
You were stolen at birth. I expect.

399
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.000
You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country

400
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.920
You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country

401
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.280
and they found someone
who looked like you and did a swap!

402
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.520
In that case.
you'll have a magic sword.

403
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.000
only it won't look magic. you see.
until it's time for you

404
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.320
only it won't look magic. you see.
until it's time for you

405
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.880
to manifest your destiny!

406
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.000
You were probably found on a
doorstep.Er. actually a hay cart.

407
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.640
You were probably found on a
doorstep.Er. actually a hay cart.

408
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.080
Just as good! Hey. it's customary
when somebody asks your name

409
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.000
to reciprocate and ask them theirs.

410
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.720
to reciprocate and ask them theirs.

411
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.240
I'm Malicia Grim. by the way.

412
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.920
Er... Hello.

413
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.680
erm. Malicia.

414
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.000
Nice. erm. to...
No! Sardines! Back!

415
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.680
Nice. erm. to...
No! Sardines! Back!

416
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.520
Rat!

417
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.800
Sardines. no!
Easy on the tap dancing!

418
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.440
Sorry! I've just got these...

419
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.000
..d-dancing feet!

420
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.440
..d-dancing feet!

421
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.080
Whoa!
Ugh!

422
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.000
All right.
I think it goes like this...

423
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.240
All right.
I think it goes like this...

424
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.880
This rat is clearly a magical rat.
I bet he's not the only one.

425
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.000
Born that way. or something happened
to him. or them.

426
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.600
Born that way. or something happened
to him. or them.

427
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.960
and now they're quite intelligent.
despite the tap dancing.

428
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And the cat is friends with you...
Why would rats and a cat be friends?

429
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.120
And the cat is friends with you...
Why would rats and a cat be friends?

430
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.120
There must be some kind of
an arrangement. No. don't tell me!

431
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.000
I shouldn't think anyone
ever has to tell you anything.

432
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.000
Something to do with
plagues of rats. right?

433
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.880
Something to do with
plagues of rats. right?

434
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.320
All those towns we've heard about?
You got together with Keith here

435
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.440
and you go from town to town
pretending to BE a plague of rats.

436
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.000
Keith pretends to be a pied piper
and they all follow him out

437
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.360
Keith pretends to be a pied piper
and they all follow him out

438
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.600
and you make loads of cash. right?

439
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.000
It's all a big swindle.

440
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.160
It's all a big swindle.

441
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.720
She's got us bang to rights. boss.

442
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.760
You won't tell on us. will you?
Ha!

443
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.000
A talking cat
and a talking. tap-dancing rat?

444
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.840
A talking cat
and a talking. tap-dancing rat?

445
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.960
They'll think I'm making up stories
again

446
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment.Locked out?

447
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.720
and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment.Locked out?

448
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.960
So I can't get to my books. It might
not be obvious. but I read a lot.

449
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.120
My father says "Too much!"

450
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.000
Ah!

451
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.360
Ah!

452
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.840
So. here's the question -
how did you learn to talk?

453
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.120
In a real story.
this is where we'd get a flashback.

454
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.000
Flashback?What's that?
It's where you get the backstory.

455
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.280
Flashback?What's that?
It's where you get the backstory.

456
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.440
Go ahead. tell me what happened.

457
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.000
There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no.

458
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.720
There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no.

459
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.720
What happened? Er...

460
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.920
No-one knows for sure. you know.
but. erm...

461
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.000
Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!

462
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.240
Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!

463
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.280
That was back when we were just
normal. everyday rats.

464
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.920
squeaking and squabbling.

465
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.000
We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles. for example!

466
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200
We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles. for example!

467
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.040
We love candle stubs!

468
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.000
And a weather-beaten broomstick.

469
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.000
That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions.

470
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.920
That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions.

471
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.320
We drank green bubbly stuff
from the bottoms of cauldrons

472
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.880
and gnawed our way
through worn-out spell books.

473
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.000
Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!

474
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.480
Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!

475
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.120
We eventually figured that out.

476
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.000
The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork...

477
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.160
The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork...

478
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.840
..the establishment of learning.
where magic is studied.

479
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.000
All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!

480
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.480
All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!

481
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.560
I like it.

482
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.520
Once we got smart.
we learned to read

483
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.000
and gave ourselves names from
the things we found in the dump.

484
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.760
"Sardines."

485
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.000
"Peaches."

486
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.640
"Peaches."

487
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.760
"In-Brine!"

488
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.600
What of the cat?
Cats don't eat any old rubbish.

489
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.000
Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump.

490
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump.

491
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.080
but he did get intelligent
around the same time.

492
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.040
As an intelligent cat. I do vow.
and it is a point of pride.

493
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.000
to not eat anything that can speak.

494
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.400
to not eat anything that can speak.

495
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.080
I know just what we must do next
to solve the mystery of our town!

496
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.000
Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!

497
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.840
Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!

498
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.920
Why else would you be in this story.
if not to solve the mystery?

499
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.720
We need to sneak into
the Rat-Catcher's Guild

500
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.000
and find out what they're up to.

501
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.280
and find out what they're up to.

502
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.560
Ah. I am oddly compelled to follow.

503
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.000
It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag.

504
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.040
It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag.

505
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.120
Yah! Ready?

506
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.160
Let's go!

507
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.320
I think I love her.

508
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.000
Er. sir?

509
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.040
You. er. you wanted to see us.

510
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.400
sir.

511
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.000
There are new rats in town.

512
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.880
There are new rats in town.

513
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.320
Are you sure. sir?

514
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.000
The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!

515
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.040
The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!

516
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.000
Catch them and bring them to me.

517
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.160
Catch them and bring them to me.

518
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.880
Yes. sir! Right off. sir!

519
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.120
You know I have a thing...

520
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.560
..for rats.

521
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.360
Important safety tip.

522
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.920
Don't eat a dead rat
that just ate something.

523
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.000
that just ate something.
that made it dead.

524
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.600
that just ate something.
that made it dead.

525
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.880
Dangerous Beans says
we shouldn't eat rats at all.

526
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.880
True. Very true.
Unless you're hungry.

527
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.000
But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly.

528
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.440
But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly.

529
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.280
Strange.

530
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.000
Reminds me of. erm.

531
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.760
Reminds me of. erm.

532
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.320
a Prattle and Johnson
Little Snapper.

533
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.680
but those are not round
like this one.

534
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.000
Mm...

535
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.040
Mm...

536
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.400
Ah...
And there's no extra safety catch.

537
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.000
I think we need... Mr Clicky.

538
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.720
I think we need... Mr Clicky.

539
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.240
Mr Clicky!
Come on. Mr Clicky.

540
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.000
Mr Clicky!

541
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Mr Clicky!

542
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.280
Oy. good luck. buddy!

543
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.280
It's showtime. Mr Clicky!

544
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.080
Go. Mr Clicky. you can do it!

545
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.000
On the double. soldier.

546
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.960
On the double. soldier.

547
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.760
What are you waiting for?

548
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.320
Time to do your duty.

549
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.000
Mr Clicky?
Hey!

550
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.080
Mr Clicky?
Hey!

551
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.240
Where do you think you're going?!
Come on. lad!

552
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.320
You're made of metal. This...

553
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.000
can't... hurt.

554
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.040
can't... hurt.

555
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.440
Ugh!

556
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.600
Darktan?!

557
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.920
Wh... What?

558
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.000
What is this?

559
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.040
What is this?

560
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.440
Ingenious. Never seen this before.

561
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.280
It's a cage.
A cage.

562
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.000
A cage!

563
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.920
A cage!

564
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.000
What's a cage?

565
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.320
It's used to capture a rat.

566
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.000
Who would want to keep a rat?

567
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.760
Who would want to keep a rat?

568
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.000
"And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign.

569
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.320
"And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign.

570
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.000
Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."

571
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.240
Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."

572
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.360
"He wasn't going
to Howard the Stoat's tea party."

573
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.000
"He was heading into the Dark Wood."

574
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.760
"He was heading into the Dark Wood."

575
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.000
She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous

576
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.480
She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous

577
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.160
unless people can tell
that you are being inconspicuous.

578
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.000
The trouble is. your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale.

579
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.120
The trouble is. your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale.

580
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.840
Mm. That's harmless. though.
isn't it?

581
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.000
Maybe. But in fairy tales.

582
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.320
Maybe. But in fairy tales.

583
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.680
when someone gets hurt...

584
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.880
..it's just a word.

585
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.000
Hm?

586
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.440
Hm?

587
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.000
Luckily.
I'm prepared for every eventuality.

588
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.920
Luckily.
I'm prepared for every eventuality.

589
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.520
The grapnel and the rope ladder
take up a lot of room.

590
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.720
And then there's the medicine kit
and the kettle. the back-up kettle.

591
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.000
the sewing kit...
..and the mirror for sending signals

592
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.720
the sewing kit...
..and the mirror for sending signals

593
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.840
and these!

594
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.760
Hair pins?You just push it
into the keyhole and twiddle.

595
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.000
Malicia. those things work
in stories. not...That's right!

596
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.280
Malicia. those things work
in stories. not...That's right!

597
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.320
Oh. dear me.So.
we're back in your story. are we?

598
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.000
And what am I in your story?

599
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.880
And what am I in your story?

600
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.000
Mm. not sure. You're not handsome
enough for a love interest

601
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.480
and you're not funny enough
for comic relief.

602
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.000
Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend

603
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.040
Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend

604
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.040
who serves as a sounding board to
help me resolve my ethical dilemmas.

605
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.000
H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?

606
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.880
H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?

607
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.040
I told you. they lock me
out of my room to punish me.

608
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.560
I've seen thieves at work.
"cat burglars" they call them

609
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.000
because they are nearly as clever
as cats.

610
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.920
because they are nearly as clever
as cats.

611
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.120
They have complicated little tools

612
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.480
which are used with great care
and precision.

613
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.000
They don't ever just...

614
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.360
They don't ever just...

615
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.920
There we are!

616
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.680
That was luck.

617
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.600
Oh. no! I didn't expect this!

618
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.120
Well. it's a dirty room full of junk.
what did you expect?

619
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.000
I was expecting something horrible.
yet interesting.

620
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.720
I was expecting something horrible.
yet interesting.

621
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.160
Some ghastly clue
that would advance the plot.

622
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.000
The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen. one after another.

623
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.840
The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen. one after another.

624
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.160
Pfft! There's always a plot.
You just have to know where to look.

625
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.000
Ha! That's it!
A secret passage. of course!

626
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.760
Ha! That's it!
A secret passage. of course!

627
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.360
Everyone. look for the entrance
to the secret passage!

628
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.360
What does a secret passage
look like?

629
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.000
Well. it won't look like one.
of course!

630
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.120
Well. it won't look like one.
of course!

631
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.240
Oh. well. in that case.
I can see dozens of secret passages.

632
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.000
Er. I don't know
how to look for something

633
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.800
that doesn't look like
the thing I'm looking for.

634
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.080
Agh!
I know it's a rather daring idea.

635
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.840
but suppose there might not be
a secret passage?

636
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.000
There has to be!
But they're hard to find.

637
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.840
There has to be!
But they're hard to find.

638
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.040
And then you give up.

639
00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.000
and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall.

640
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.120
and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall.

641
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.720
that you inadvertently operate
the secret switch!

642
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.000
Huh...

643
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.040
Huh...

644
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.760
I'll just rest my arm innocently
on this coat hook.

645
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.000
And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously...

646
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.680
And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously...

647
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.040
..fails to appear!

648
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.200
Clearly. certain villains
totally fail to know

649
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.360
how to design
a proper secret passage.

650
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.000
Keith. look!

651
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.840
Keith. look!

652
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.440
Hey! Why is there a rat hole
in a rat-catchers' building?

653
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.000
I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat.

654
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.600
I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat.

655
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.160
Yes! That often happens in stories!

656
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.120
The stupid person comes up
with the good idea by accident!

657
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.640
There's a sort of little lever
in there.

658
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.800
I'll give it a... push.

659
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.640
Agh!

660
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.000
A trap door! Quite well-hidden.
No wonder we didn't see it!

661
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
A trap door! Quite well-hidden.
No wonder we didn't see it!

662
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.200
Keith! Are you all right?
Not hurt!

663
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.760
Much.

664
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.000
It's a sort of a cellar.

665
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.600
It's a sort of a cellar.

666
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.120
I'm all right
because I landed on my head.

667
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.000
Here's a ladder.
Why didn't you use it?

668
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.480
Here's a ladder.
Why didn't you use it?

669
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.000
I was unable to take advantage of it
on account of...

670
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.560
..falling past it.

671
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.000
Where's my hat?

672
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.080
Where's my hat?

673
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.640
Ahh!

674
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.560
Oh. my goodness!
Huh?

675
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.720
Food!

676
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.320
Smoked ham!

677
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.600
Mmm! So good!

678
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.840
Wow!
Over here!

679
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.960
I found the bakery section!

680
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.160
So they are stealing food...

681
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.440
..mostly at night.

682
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.000
for some undetermined purpose.

683
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.920
for some undetermined purpose.

684
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960
Those are the best mysteries!

685
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.600
The more they are solved.
the more mysterious they get.

686
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.080
All right. speak up.
Agh!

687
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.000
Just say a few words.
Or a poem maybe? What about a lim...

688
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.160
Just say a few words.
Or a poem maybe? What about a lim...

689
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.160
Agh! Peaches!

690
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.000
It's you!Put me down! Do you mind?
Oh! Of course!

691
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.080
It's you!Put me down! Do you mind?
Oh! Of course!

692
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.920
Keith! Sardines! We're in...

693
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.560
Ah. don't worry. I know everything!

694
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.000
We're in trouble!
You won't believe what we've found!

695
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.320
We're in trouble!
You won't believe what we've found!

696
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.840
I did ask you if you could talk.
didn't I?Yes. you did. but...

697
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.000
I'm quite vigilant about asking.
you know.

698
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.120
Yes. yes! You've made your point!
I believe you!

699
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.440
But we're still in trouble!
Why? What's wrong?

700
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.760
Mr Clicky?

701
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.000
What are you doing here?When I get
my hands on that wind-up toy...

702
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.280
Darktan! Are you hurt?

703
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.320
Ugh!

704
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.920
Pfffff! Just my pride.

705
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.000
Here.

706
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.320
Here.

707
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.000
let me handle this.

708
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.440
Where is he? I will crush
that useless piece of tin!

709
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.000
Stop!

710
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.080
Stop!

711
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.320
I just want to talk to ya.
It won't hurt!

712
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.640
Well. it will just a little!
Back off. Mr Too Many Belts!

713
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.000
It's not cool to pick on
the little guys.

714
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.120
It's not cool to pick on
the little guys.

715
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.200
He had one job to do!

716
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.480
You're safe with me now.

717
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.080
Huh. So this is what they do.
Yeah.

718
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.000
This is new. Insidious.
These traps. very cleverly designed.

719
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.360
This is new. Insidious.
These traps. very cleverly designed.

720
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.440
It would have to be to capture you!

721
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.880
They are designed
to take us prisoner.

722
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.000
Prisoner? What for?

723
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Prisoner? What for?

724
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.720
That's pretty much our business.

725
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.280
don't you think?

726
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.000
I knew you were a part of this!
Ha!

727
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.400
I knew you were a part of this!
Ha!

728
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.520
Tell us a story. story-telling girl!

729
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.720
You're stealing food. somehow.
for some reason.

730
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.000
To feed the rats you've captured.
maybe. and must be hiding somewhere.

731
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.880
To feed the rats you've captured.
maybe. and must be hiding somewhere.

732
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.880
You don't need to be clever to see
that this is a bad situation

733
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.920
and might need running away from
quite soon.

734
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.000
..so that's why the food
went missing.Get them!

735
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.400
..so that's why the food
went missing.Get them!

736
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.640
Come here!
Such as now.

737
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.000
Oh. you think Malicia is the only
person who can comment on the story?

738
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.440
Oh. you think Malicia is the only
person who can comment on the story?

739
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.000
Well. she thinks the story
is about her. but it's not.

740
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.680
Well. she thinks the story
is about her. but it's not.

741
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.640
Check out the title
if you harbour any doubts.

742
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.520
Oh. I hate cats!

743
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.400
Rats served on a silver platter!

744
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.000
Get that thing off my foot!
Boss Man will be very happy!

745
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.600
Get that thing off my foot!
Boss Man will be very happy!

746
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.080
And now the kids!

747
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.720
Let go of me!
Go and tie 'em up somewhere.Let go!

748
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.000
Hey. look! The rat.
Why is it wearing a hat?Hm?

749
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.480
Hey. look! The rat.
Why is it wearing a hat?Hm?

750
00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.480
Huh!

751
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.000
Billy. look at that! A show-rat!

752
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.360
Billy. look at that! A show-rat!

753
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.720
Oh. don't look at me like that.
like I'm abandoning my friends.

754
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.000
I'm a cat.
and cats choose their battles wisely!

755
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.160
I'm a cat.
and cats choose their battles wisely!

756
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.400
Hey. Billy!
He'd be good for the pit.

757
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.000
We'll call him The Rat With the Hat!

758
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.360
We'll call him The Rat With the Hat!

759
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.720
What are they keeping us for?
Normally. a rat is trapped

760
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.200
and then...

761
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.000
What's so funny. Dangerous Beans?

762
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.040
What's so funny. Dangerous Beans?

763
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.720
Maurice! I knew you wouldn't
let us down. old friend!

764
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.000
I've always said.
"We can depend on Maurice."

765
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.800
I've always said.
"We can depend on Maurice."

766
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.680
Never a doubt.
Mm. Right.

767
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.760
I saw you rush off to start looking
for us. even before we were caught!

768
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.880
Ooh! Hey!

769
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.440
So. what's your plan?
First. we get out of here.Excellent.

770
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.000
Then get as far away from this town
as possible.

771
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.880
Then get as far away from this town
as possible.

772
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.400
Yeah. After we rescue Sardines.

773
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.680
You left out that part.
Yes.

774
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.000
An oversight.
Let me go over it again.

775
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.440
An oversight.
Let me go over it again.

776
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.280
First. we get out of here.

777
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.480
then...
Ahem! Plus the boy and the girl.

778
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.000
They're tied up in another cellar.
We have to rescue them. too.

779
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.840
They're tied up in another cellar.
We have to rescue them. too.

780
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.880
Oh! Humans. you know!

781
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.960
They'll eventually work it all out.
deals will be struck!

782
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
We have to find out
where they took Sardines.

783
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.880
We have to find out
where they took Sardines.

784
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.960
Perhaps you heard them mention...
the pit?

785
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.000
I was in a place once.
a storage building.

786
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.440
I was in a place once.
a storage building.

787
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.720
Some men came in and put a big
round wall in the middle of the floor

788
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.000
and called it... the pit.
''

789
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.800
and called it... the pit.
''

790
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.920
They had a box of rats
and tipped them into the ring

791
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.000
and then then they put in the dogs.
Terriers. ''

792
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.120
and then then they put in the dogs.
Terriers. ''

793
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.040
The rats fought the dogs?

794
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.440
Fought? No.

795
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.000
Mostly they ran around and around.
It's called rat coursing.

796
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.400
Mostly they ran around and around.
It's called rat coursing.

797
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.960
How is it we've never heard of this?

798
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.920
Because there wouldn't be any rats
left to tell you.

799
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.640
Right. then.

800
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.000
Peaches. Dangerous Beans. Maurice.
you go free up Keith and Malicia.

801
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.800
Peaches. Dangerous Beans. Maurice.
you go free up Keith and Malicia.

802
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.480
Nourishing. Special Offer.
Delicious In-Brine.

803
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.000
we rescue Sardines.
His trail will be easy to follow.

804
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.800
we rescue Sardines.
His trail will be easy to follow.

805
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.080
He was widdling the entire way.

806
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.000
So. let's go over it again.
shall we?

807
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.400
So. let's go over it again.
shall we?

808
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.320
You don't have a knife
of any kind?

809
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.000
None.Or some handy matches
that could burn through the rope?

810
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.880
None.Or some handy matches
that could burn through the rope?

811
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.440
No. Sorry.

812
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.840
Did you even look?
I looked!

813
00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.120
You know. in many ways.

814
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.000
I don't think the plot
of this adventure

815
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.320
I don't think the plot
of this adventure

816
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.120
has been properly structured.

817
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.000
Rrrrgh!

818
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.720
Rrrrgh!

819
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.080
Keep the pace!

820
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.760
All right.
I'm running out of patience.

821
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.480
I'm gonna start to reach here.

822
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.000
This would be the ideal time for you
to discover your secret powers!

823
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.480
This would be the ideal time for you
to discover your secret powers!

824
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.000
Oh! Great idea! Ah. yeah!

825
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.000
Oh...!Yes?
I feel...

826
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.920
Huh? Huh?

827
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.400
No. Nothing.

828
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.000
Ugh! Are you sure?

829
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.160
Ugh! Are you sure?

830
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.840
When I first saw you I thought.
"He must have some amazing power

831
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.720
that will manifest itself
when we're in trouble."

832
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.000
"No-one could be that useless.
unless it was a disguise!"

833
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.400
"No-one could be that useless.
unless it was a disguise!"

834
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.320
No! Look. I'm the kind of person
heroes aren't.

835
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.000
I'm a cheat. part of a rat scam.

836
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.080
I'm a cheat. part of a rat scam.

837
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.680
What I do is play music

838
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.880
and I do that pretty well.
thank you.

839
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.000
But I am not a hero in disguise.

840
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.280
But I am not a hero in disguise.

841
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.720
Sorry to disappoint you.

842
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.000
Oh.

843
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.640
Oh.

844
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.280
So. you're the commoner

845
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.720
who has to rise to the occasion?

846
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.000
You should've found someone else.

847
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.720
You should've found someone else.

848
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.360
Ow! There's something behind me!

849
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.120
We're gnawing through the ropes!
What? Ow!

850
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.000
Hold still!
Dangerous Beans! Peaches!

851
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.400
Hold still!
Dangerous Beans! Peaches!

852
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.800
It's about time!
Talking animals to the rescue!

853
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.000
Unbelievable!
This is almost too easy!

854
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680
Unbelievable!
This is almost too easy!

855
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.480
Almost like - pfft! - Mr Bunnsy.

856
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.280
Mr Bunnsy? What about Mr Bunnsy?

857
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.000
Oh. those are just books
for little kids!

858
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.480
Oh. those are just books
for little kids!

859
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.480
There's a rat and a rabbit
and a snake

860
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.720
and they go around
having adventures.

861
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.000
They wear clothes and talk to humans
and everyone's so nice and cosy.

862
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.120
They wear clothes and talk to humans
and everyone's so nice and cosy.

863
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.440
It is so silly!

864
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.000
My father read them to me
when I was a kid.Erm...

865
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.880
My father read them to me
when I was a kid.Erm...

866
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.360
I think you'd better stop.

867
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.320
Morris?Of course.
now I see how simplistic they are!

868
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.000
No subtext. no social commentary.

869
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.720
No subtext. no social commentary.

870
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.880
Doris the Duck loses a shoe?

871
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.080
You call that narrative tension?
Malicia. please stop!What?

872
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.000
You knew! YOU KNEW!

873
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.720
You knew! YOU KNEW!

874
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.600
There's no island paradise.
There never was.

875
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.400
You lied to us!
No. I...

876
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.000
Look... No. Peaches. don't!

877
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.800
Look... No. Peaches. don't!

878
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.800
I never had the heart to tell you.

879
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.960
Peaches. it's all right.No!
Peaches!

880
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.720
Peaches? No!

881
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.280
Peaches! Come back!

882
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.280
Dangerous Beans. don't...
Peaches!

883
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.000
All their hopes... dashed.

884
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.800
All their hopes... dashed.

885
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.120
Bad cat! BAD CAT!

886
00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.000
Oh. I hate this feeling.
That you've done something wrong?

887
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.920
Oh. I hate this feeling.
That you've done something wrong?

888
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.280
No! That I now need to do
something good to make up for it.

889
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.000
Like. figure out how to get you two
past the rat-catchers.

890
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.280
Like. figure out how to get you two
past the rat-catchers.

891
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.760
Peaches?

892
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.000
Peaches?

893
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.040
Peaches?

894
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.240
She came this way.

895
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.920
Peaches. please!
We can work things out.

896
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.000
The book is a lie! You lied to me!

897
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.200
The book is a lie! You lied to me!

898
00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.000
The book is not what matters!
It's what we make of it!

899
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.080
The book is not what matters!
It's what we make of it!

900
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.960
Go away!

901
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.000
I don't think we are alone
down here.

902
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.520
I don't think we are alone
down here.

903
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.080
If you would just stay in one place
till I get to you!

904
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.000
Leave me alone!

905
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.320
Leave me alone!

906
00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.000
Beans?

907
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.560
Beans?

908
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.320
Beans? I think there's
something else down here!

909
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.920
Peaches!

910
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.000
Bon appetit.

911
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.320
Bon appetit.

912
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.680
Hey! It's that cat!

913
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.200
Enjoying your last supper?

914
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.000
What?
Hey...

915
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.440
What?
Hey...

916
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.040
What's this? Killalot.

917
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.520
Oh. That sounds bad.
What?!

918
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.000
How did you...
Hey. you stole our poison!

919
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.640
How did you...
Hey. you stole our poison!

920
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.280
Steal? No. no. no. no.
We don't steal.

921
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.760
We just put it somewhere else.

922
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.000
Set that down. That's dangerous
stuff! And tell me where you put it.

923
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.480
Set that down. That's dangerous
stuff! And tell me where you put it.

924
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.800
Well. now that you mention it.
I think the cat there

925
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.000
put most of it in the sugar.

926
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.720
put most of it in the sugar.

927
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.520
Oh. I knew that tea tasted funny.

928
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.000
You...
Don't even think of hurting us.

929
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.600
You...
Don't even think of hurting us.

930
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.920
We might forget
where we left the antidote.

931
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.280
There is no antidote to Killalot!

932
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.000
Oh. but there is. I know a few
experts on the topic of rat poison.

933
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.040
Oh. but there is. I know a few
experts on the topic of rat poison.

934
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.720
Answers. Now.

935
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.000
You caught rats alive
and crammed them into cages. Why?

936
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.240
You caught rats alive
and crammed them into cages. Why?

937
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.480
I can feel things happening!

938
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.880
Don't you know anything
about poison?

939
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.000
Your stomach won't start to melt
for about. oh. 20 minutes?

940
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.120
Your stomach won't start to melt
for about. oh. 20 minutes?

941
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.000
This is great stuff.

942
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.760
Oh. this is inhuman!

943
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.000
No. it's extremely human. Your
poisons do it to rats every day.

944
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.600
No. it's extremely human. Your
poisons do it to rats every day.

945
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.840
Now. tell me about the rats
in the cages.

946
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.000
At first. we caught a few!
For the pit!

947
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.600
At first. we caught a few!
For the pit!

948
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.920
Then?
We accidentally made a Rat King.

949
00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.000
A Rat King?

950
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.520
A Rat King?

951
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.160
Is it still alive?
I've never seen him afraid before.

952
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.560
IS IT STILL ALIVE?!

953
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.000
Er. w-what is a Rat King?

954
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.680
Er. w-what is a Rat King?

955
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.640
Rat kings are deadly evil.

956
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.760
A collection of rats. their tails
knotted together. and then...

957
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.000
We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket

958
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.440
We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket

959
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.000
and later. when we opened the lid...

960
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
..there it was!

961
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.680
The rats. together. their minds merge
to form one creature.

962
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.000
It gains consciousness. power.
mind power.

963
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.320
It gains consciousness. power.
mind power.

964
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.680
It can dominate and control others.

965
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.000
This is a game-changer.

966
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.160
This is a game-changer.

967
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.280
A Rat King? No. This is too much.

968
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.600
Oh. wait! Where are you going?

969
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.800
I. erm.

970
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.800
I have to go and warn the others!

971
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.760
Antidote! Antidote. please!

972
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.440
My stomach feels like
there's rats running around in it!

973
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.000
You don't deserve it. but we left it
in that little cellar downstairs.

974
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.880
You don't deserve it. but we left it
in that little cellar downstairs.

975
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.760
I should hurry if I were you.

976
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.920
Me. too!

977
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.880
How much poison
did Maurice give them?

978
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.000
You mean the laxative? Lots.
Where is it?

979
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.200
You mean the laxative? Lots.
Where is it?

980
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.400
But they should be all right if they
don't take too much of the antidote.

981
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.840
And what did you leave down there
for the antidote?

982
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.000
More laxative.

983
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.520
More laxative.

984
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.720
I've got to find a toilet!

985
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.400
Too late.

986
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.000
The laxative was brilliant.

987
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.400
The laxative was brilliant.

988
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.160
But giving it to them as an
antidote. as well. that is...

989
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.960
Clever? Narratively satisfying?

990
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Genius!

991
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.560
Genius!

992
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.520
The genius part is.

993
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.480
I know where to go next.

994
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.240
To the forest!

995
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.000
The Dark Wood?

996
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.360
The Dark Wood?

997
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.120
Well. there are trees
and it is dark.

998
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.240
Why?
Don't you know? Don't you read?

999
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.000
There is only one thing
that can control a Rat King.

1000
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.720
There is only one thing
that can control a Rat King.

1001
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.120
One! In the entire landscape
of literature!

1002
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.040
We have to get it
or all of us are in real trouble.

1003
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.000
What?

1004
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.720
What?

1005
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.520
The pipe of the Pied Piper.

1006
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.360
The real Pied Piper!

1007
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.480
You hear the words "Rat King"
and you get out of there.

1008
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.360
Permanently. That's the rule.

1009
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.000
Yep! Lucky me!
And what an end to the story!

1010
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.200
Yep! Lucky me!
And what an end to the story!

1011
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.520
The Amazing Maurice barely escapes
with six of his nine lives.

1012
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.000
And these little beauties. of course!

1013
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.200
And these little beauties. of course!

1014
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.040
Yep. huge advantage being a cat.

1015
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.000
Actually. it's too bad for them
they're not cats.

1016
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.880
Actually. it's too bad for them
they're not cats.

1017
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Hey.
why am I even thinking about them?

1018
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.240
Hey.
why am I even thinking about them?

1019
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.280
I'm not feeling guilty
about this. I'm a cat!

1020
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.800
Free to follow my own fate.
My next big adventure.

1021
00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.000
I think I'll go to sea.

1022
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.080
I think I'll go to sea.

1023
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.640
Always fancied being a ship's cat.

1024
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.160
Might get a little bit sick.
I suppose. but I'll get used to it.

1025
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.000
What a twist!
And it's just getting better!

1026
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.920
What a twist!
And it's just getting better!

1027
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.040
Malicia?
You've been up here three days!

1028
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.880
Do you want some dinner?

1029
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.000
I'm coming down soon. Dad!
I promise!

1030
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.520
I'm coming down soon. Dad!
I promise!

1031
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.200
This is not the behaviour
of a normal girl.

1032
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.000
Where were we? Oh. yes. Mr Bunnsy.

1033
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.320
Where were we? Oh. yes. Mr Bunnsy.

1034
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.880
"Ratty Rupert was the bravest rat
there ever was."

1035
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.040
"Everyone in Furry Bottom said so."

1036
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.000
"So he was sent to find Mr Bunnsy."

1037
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.200
"So he was sent to find Mr Bunnsy."

1038
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.560
"Little did he know
what was waiting for him."

1039
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.000
This must be it.
Ten rats in 32 seconds!

1040
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.320
This must be it.
Ten rats in 32 seconds!

1041
00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.120
Come on. give me a hand.

1042
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.000
That's a smidgen over three seconds
per rat!

1043
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.120
That's a smidgen over three seconds
per rat!

1044
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.000
Let's hear it for
The Blitz From Bad Blintz!

1045
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.000
Billy!

1046
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.120
Billy!

1047
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.480
Sardines is not far.

1048
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.000
Ready for the next round?
Yes!

1049
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.240
Ready for the next round?
Yes!

1050
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.960
Give it up for...

1051
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.800
..Jacko!

1052
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.000
Are you ready

1053
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.200
Are you ready

1054
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.400
to rattle?

1055
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.680
How long will they last?

1056
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.280
Oh. no!This is even worse
than Maurice told!

1057
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.000
Sardines is dog food.
Idiots! Work together!

1058
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.600
Sardines is dog food.
Idiots! Work together!

1059
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.240
You could strip that fleabag
to the bone!

1060
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.000
That was a quick one!

1061
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.480
That was a quick one!

1062
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:10.000
Six rats in 28 seconds!
Good boy!

1063
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.400
All right. folks!

1064
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.000
For tonight's main event.
we've got a real treat for you!

1065
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.240
For tonight's main event.
we've got a real treat for you!

1066
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.440
You won't have seen a rat like this
before.

1067
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.000
We call him The Rat With the Hat!

1068
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.480
We call him The Rat With the Hat!

1069
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.200
Sardines!

1070
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.000
Your fans are waiting!

1071
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.080
Your fans are waiting!

1072
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.120
Showtime!

1073
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.000
And here is the legendary champion.

1074
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.480
And here is the legendary champion.

1075
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.000
Brute the Cute!

1076
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.000
Aww!

1077
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.600
Aww!

1078
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.000
He doesn't stand a chance!
All right. all right. calm down!

1079
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.480
He doesn't stand a chance!
All right. all right. calm down!

1080
00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.280
We do the Rubber-String-Thing!
You know what to do!

1081
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.480
Everyone get into position!
Um. rubber-string... what?

1082
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.000
You. come here! Attach the string!
Me?

1083
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.440
You. come here! Attach the string!
Me?

1084
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.920
I don't know if I can...
Quick! Do it!

1085
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.400
OK! All right!

1086
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.560
Ten dollars he won't last a second!

1087
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.080
Fight!

1088
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.520
Oof!

1089
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.480
Huh?

1090
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.000
Get it done!
Double the pressure. half the speed!

1091
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.840
# Dip-a-doo-ba-da. boo!

1092
00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.880
What is the rat doing?
The Charleston. I think.

1093
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.000
Hurry up!
Wait!

1094
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.960
Hurry up!
Wait!

1095
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.480
# Ba-ba-ba-da. baa! #

1096
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.640
Now or never!Nearly done!
Come on!Got it!

1097
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.000
Sardines. here I come...!

1098
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.600
Sardines. here I come...!

1099
00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.520
I-I... Oh. YOU!

1100
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.400
I thought that I would...

1101
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.000
Aaaggghhh!

1102
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.440
Aaaggghhh!

1103
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.520
Sardines. we'll get you out of this!

1104
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.000
Did the rat just talk?

1105
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.520
Did the rat just talk?

1106
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.000
Don't worry. Stay behind me.

1107
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.080
Don't move. I've got you! Huh?

1108
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.760
Go on. Brute. get stuck in!

1109
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.040
What are you waiting for?

1110
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.000
He's not in the right position!

1111
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.880
He's not in the right position!

1112
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.880
I know. I know...

1113
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.760
You've spent your showbusiness
career biting rats that ran away.

1114
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.000
But rats that fight back...
Huh! Huh!

1115
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.920
But rats that fight back...
Huh! Huh!

1116
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.080
..they're something new.

1117
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.000
Huh?

1118
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.000
$15 on the talking rat!

1119
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.520
$15 on the talking rat!

1120
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.000
Come on. you mutt.
or are you gonna chicken out?

1121
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.560
Come on. you mutt.
or are you gonna chicken out?

1122
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.240
Attack!

1123
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.640
Ha-ha! Smell ya later.

1124
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.520
Watch it!

1125
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.960
Oh. yes! A brawl!

1126
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.240
$20 on...

1127
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.200
Puh! Humans!

1128
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.000
Hey. little fella!

1129
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.640
Hey. little fella!

1130
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.160
Come on. then.

1131
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.000
All in one piece? Good.

1132
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.560
All in one piece? Good.

1133
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.520
Thanks. Darktan!
Thanks to all of you!

1134
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.080
Mm...

1135
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.880
Ha! Welcome to the rescue squad!
Mission completed!

1136
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.000
Let's go! But stay frosty!

1137
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.160
Let's go! But stay frosty!

1138
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.920
What is that. that tune?

1139
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.600
Huh? Oh. sorry. was feeling nervous.
It helps me...

1140
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.000
Agh! ..if I play. Oof! Ow!

1141
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.920
Agh! ..if I play. Oof! Ow!

1142
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.920
Mm. it was nice.

1143
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.200
Say. do you have a princess. or
someone else you are in love with.

1144
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.000
who might be impressed
by your heroics?

1145
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.560
who might be impressed
by your heroics?

1146
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.840
No. I do not.

1147
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.080
Oh. that's too bad.

1148
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.000
otherwise you and I
might have been an item.

1149
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.360
otherwise you and I
might have been an item.

1150
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.720
How could my having someone else
mean I'm right for you?

1151
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.000
Plot complications!
Every story needs them.

1152
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.440
Plot complications!
Every story needs them.

1153
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.600
If you were doing this
for someone else.

1154
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.120
I would be the girl
right in front of you

1155
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.000
who's obviously much better for you
but you don't see it

1156
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.600
who's obviously much better for you
but you don't see it

1157
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.600
and you would realise in the end.

1158
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.000
But since there isn't anyone else.
I'm not that girl.

1159
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.800
But since there isn't anyone else.
I'm not that girl.

1160
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.120
Malicia.

1161
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.280
this isn't some story.

1162
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.680
That's what everyone's been
trying to tell you.

1163
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.000
Listen. orphan boy.
who was probably a changeling fairy

1164
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.960
Listen. orphan boy.
who was probably a changeling fairy

1165
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.080
and that's why you can play
amazing music.

1166
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.920
I'll tell you something!

1167
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.960
I know about real life.

1168
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
I know people think I'm silly.

1169
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.560
I know people think I'm silly.

1170
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.920
but you know what?

1171
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.800
Aaaggghhh!

1172
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.000
If you don't turn your life
into a story.

1173
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.040
If you don't turn your life
into a story.

1174
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.720
you become part
of someone else's story!

1175
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.080
And what if your story
doesn't go anywhere?

1176
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.320
But it will. It always does.

1177
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.000
It has to go somewhere.

1178
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.640
It has to go somewhere.

1179
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.280
There!

1180
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.960
There he is!

1181
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.400
That's dedication!

1182
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.000
He wears his Pied Piper outfit
even in his down time.

1183
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.840
He wears his Pied Piper outfit
even in his down time.

1184
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.320
He looks...

1185
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.000
..somewhat intense!

1186
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.800
..somewhat intense!

1187
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.920
He did once get upset
about an unpaid bill

1188
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.320
and magicked an entire town's worth
of children into the woods.

1189
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.000
never to be found!

1190
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.520
never to be found!

1191
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.920
And why did you not tell me that

1192
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.560
before now?

1193
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.000
The original fairy tales
are the best.

1194
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.440
The original fairy tales
are the best.

1195
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.680
Really quite brutal.

1196
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.240
There it is!

1197
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.000
That's the pipe!

1198
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:48.560
That's the pipe!

1199
00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.000
Ooh. nice!

1200
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.640
Ooh. nice!

1201
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.280
Yep. That's it. all right.

1202
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.000
I bet he has the whole forest
under his spell.

1203
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.560
I bet he has the whole forest
under his spell.

1204
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.960
Peaches?

1205
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.000
Peaches?

1206
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.680
Peaches?

1207
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.560
Peaches?

1208
00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.000
'Hello. Dangerous Beans.'

1209
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.520
'Hello. Dangerous Beans.'

1210
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.640
What?

1211
00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.000
Where are you? Show me!
Let me smell you!

1212
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.200
'I'm in your head.'
What? How?

1213
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.720
'See that small tunnel
to your right?'

1214
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.000
'Enter it.'

1215
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.040
'Enter it.'

1216
00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.400
'I'm up here. Dangerous Beans.'

1217
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.000
'Come to me.'

1218
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.240
'Come to me.'

1219
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:57.200
Why?'Someone I think you know
is waiting for you.'

1220
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.880
"And as night fell.

1221
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.920
Mr Bunnsy remembered.

1222
00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.000
"There's something terrible

1223
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.120
"There's something terrible

1224
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.280
in the Dark Wood!"

1225
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.000
Ominous!

1226
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.280
Ominous!

1227
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.320
Hello. Dangerous Beans.

1228
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.480
How do you know my name?

1229
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.000
I know you better
than you might think.

1230
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.920
I know you better
than you might think.

1231
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.760
And. oh. the ability
to read your thoughts does help.

1232
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.000
Where is Peaches?

1233
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:56.440
Where is Peaches?

1234
00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.000
Safe.

1235
00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.600
Where is she?

1236
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:04.000
Safe. I said!
I'm keeping her quite close.

1237
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.320
Safe. I said!
I'm keeping her quite close.

1238
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.920
Oh. don't be afraid!
Rather the opposite.

1239
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.000
I would like that you would join me.

1240
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.480
I would like that you would join me.

1241
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.600
Join you?

1242
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.120
You are a marvel. Dangerous Beans.

1243
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.000
You have a mind to rival my own.

1244
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.160
You have a mind to rival my own.

1245
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.400
a mind that is thoughtful and wise.

1246
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.720
A mind that thinks for many rats.
not just one.

1247
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.000
Oh. I send them out each night
to steal food.

1248
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.960
Oh. I send them out each night
to steal food.

1249
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
The rats grow stronger.
the humans grow weaker.

1250
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.240
The rats grow stronger.
the humans grow weaker.

1251
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.280
That is the answer to your mystery!

1252
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.000
Mm... One mind is only as strong
as one mind

1253
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.040
Mm... One mind is only as strong
as one mind

1254
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.760
and two minds are as strong as two.

1255
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.000
but put three minds together...

1256
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.160
but put three minds together...

1257
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.800
..three minds are four minds

1258
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.240
and four minds are eight minds...

1259
00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.000
..AND EIGHT MINDS ARE...

1260
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.840
..AND EIGHT MINDS ARE...

1261
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.200
..one.

1262
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.000
Where is Peaches?

1263
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:08.960
Where is Peaches?

1264
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.000
No! Help me! Help!

1265
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.000
Peaches! Peaches. I'm here!
Help me!It's all right!

1266
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.800
Peaches! Peaches. I'm here!
Help me!It's all right!

1267
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.120
It's all right. Peaches. I'm here.
Yes. Yes.

1268
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.600
You are here.

1269
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.000
Well. we want the same things.
you and I.

1270
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.080
Well. we want the same things.
you and I.

1271
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.840
We have plans.

1272
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.000
We want the triumph of rats
over humans!

1273
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.200
We want the triumph of rats
over humans!

1274
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.680
I harbour a somewhat
different dream.

1275
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.920
Individual rats and humans.

1276
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.000
living together in peace.
respect and harmony.

1277
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.120
living together in peace.
respect and harmony.

1278
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.000
Like in a story book?

1279
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.000
Yes. Exactly like in a story book.

1280
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.160
Yes. Exactly like in a story book.

1281
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.160
Complete with a happy ending.
Meow!

1282
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.000
Ugh!

1283
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.880
Ugh!

1284
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.600
Oh. you want to buy your way out?

1285
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.840
Hm. something like...

1286
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.000
..that!

1287
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.640
..that!

1288
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.000
Agh!
Morris!It's Maurice.

1289
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.640
Agh!
Morris!It's Maurice.

1290
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.280
Ah. you silly cat!

1291
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.000
Let's go!
Beans! Come on!

1292
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.720
Let's go!
Beans! Come on!

1293
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.840
Silly rat... Silly rat...
Silly Rat... Silly Rat...

1294
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.520
I can force you to join me.

1295
00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.000
Join me... Join... Join... Join...

1296
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.360
Join me... Join... Join... Join...

1297
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.800
You'll never fit through!
I'm a cat! If my head fits.

1298
00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.000
the rest will follow!

1299
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.840
the rest will follow!

1300
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.080
It's futile to run
when I'm in your heads!

1301
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.920
Don't worry!
A cat always lands on its feet!

1302
00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.000
Agh!
Aaaggghhh!

1303
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.240
Agh!
Aaaggghhh!

1304
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.360
Agh!

1305
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.520
Oof!

1306
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.000
Ah! Maurice!

1307
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.760
Ah! Maurice!

1308
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.520
Amazing Maurice.

1309
01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.760
We have to get out of here!
Get out of town! Fast!

1310
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.000
Whoa! Oof!

1311
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.560
Whoa! Oof!

1312
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.120
What about Keith and Malicia?
We're dealing with a Rat King!

1313
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.200
A Rat King?! Oh. no!

1314
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.000
OK. they can catch up.

1315
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.640
OK. they can catch up.

1316
01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.240
I'll distract him.
You grab the pipe.

1317
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.000
What? He's already asleep.

1318
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.600
What? He's already asleep.

1319
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.520
Well. then. I've done my part.

1320
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.000
I didn't do it mama. I sw...
Mmmmm!

1321
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.360
I didn't do it mama. I sw...
Mmmmm!

1322
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.960
I did...

1323
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Wow!

1324
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.560
Look out!

1325
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.440
Huh?

1326
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.000
I'm sorry. Mr Piper.
but I'm afraid I must insist

1327
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.360
I'm sorry. Mr Piper.
but I'm afraid I must insist

1328
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.160
that you hand over that pipe.

1329
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.320
Oh. now. is that so?

1330
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.000
Yes. that is so!

1331
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.920
Yes. that is so!

1332
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.600
Or else I've got this
and I'm not afraid to use it!

1333
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.000
That's a fork.

1334
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.680
That's a fork.

1335
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.480
A knife would be too sharp
to carry around in my bag.

1336
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.720
so it makes sense for me
to use a fork.

1337
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.520
Sir?

1338
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.000
Did you really
steal a town full of children?

1339
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.640
Did you really
steal a town full of children?

1340
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.040
Half the things they say about me
are not true!

1341
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.000
Well. that's a relief!
No!

1342
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.440
Well. that's a relief!
No!

1343
01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.440
He didn't say which half.
Clever girl!

1344
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.000
And you look tasty. too!Uh-oh!
I think he just told us which half.

1345
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.080
And you look tasty. too!Uh-oh!
I think he just told us which half.

1346
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.680
Out to the oven. both of you!

1347
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.640
Ugh!

1348
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.000
I think he got us!

1349
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I think he got us!

1350
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.360
Whaaa? The oven?

1351
01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.000
This is so Hansel and Gretel.

1352
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.880
This is so Hansel and Gretel.

1353
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.480
Now's about the time

1354
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.000
a character we almost forgot
will appear unexpectedly

1355
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.120
a character we almost forgot
will appear unexpectedly

1356
01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.960
to pay his debt and save the day!

1357
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.000
Looks like your story
doesn't have a happy end.

1358
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.560
Looks like your story
doesn't have a happy end.

1359
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.120
In that case. Keith.

1360
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.000
this would be the perfect moment
for you to confess

1361
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.560
this would be the perfect moment
for you to confess

1362
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.560
how you truly feel about me.

1363
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.000
How I truly feel about you?

1364
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.320
How I truly feel about you?

1365
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.880
Mm-hm!

1366
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.920
Most of the time.

1367
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.000
fairly annoyed.

1368
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.200
fairly annoyed.

1369
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.320
Agh!

1370
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Aaaggghhh...

1371
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.880
Aaaggghhh...

1372
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.000
I knew I could count on you.
Mr Clicky!

1373
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.720
I knew I could count on you.
Mr Clicky!

1374
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.280
We got it! Let's go!

1375
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.400
Now they have the rare
and precious weapon

1376
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.000
to defeat the evil Rat King!

1377
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.920
to defeat the evil Rat King!

1378
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.200
Everybody. hurry!
What's all the fuss about?

1379
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.480
A Rat King?
Well. that doesn't sound so bad.

1380
01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.000
It is. believe me.
We need to beat it pronto.

1381
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.200
It is. believe me.
We need to beat it pronto.

1382
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.800
A dead end! How do we get out?

1383
01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.000
Everybody. calm down! Please!

1384
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.760
Everybody. calm down! Please!

1385
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.360
Quiet! I'm trying to think!

1386
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.720
Agh!

1387
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.000
Hey! Watch it!
You watch it!

1388
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.160
Hey! Watch it!
You watch it!

1389
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.280
One rat can think. right?

1390
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.000
But a bunch of rats
is just a big animal

1391
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:32.520
But a bunch of rats
is just a big animal

1392
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.520
with lots of legs and no brain.

1393
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.000
As soon as there's trouble.
we're just... rats.

1394
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.080
As soon as there's trouble.
we're just... rats.

1395
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.120
If it's any help. I'm just a cat.

1396
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.680
Oh. you are not "just a cat".
Maurice.

1397
01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.000
Well. we've always wondered
how I got changed.

1398
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.080
Well. we've always wondered
how I got changed.

1399
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.320
even though I never ate any magical
rubbish from the wizard's dump.

1400
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.520
Yesss?

1401
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.000
A mystery.
Well. er. now might be the time.

1402
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.080
A mystery.
Well. er. now might be the time.

1403
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.840
Did you ever know a rat. quite big.
one ear missing.

1404
01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.000
had a bit of a speech difficulty?

1405
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.120
had a bit of a speech difficulty?

1406
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.480
Oh. that sounds like Additives.
Right?

1407
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.240
Oh. no!

1408
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.000
All right! All right! I ate him!

1409
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.880
All right! All right! I ate him!

1410
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.760
I hadn't learned to think yet!
I was hungry!

1411
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.000
I ate him and then I got changed.
too!

1412
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.280
I ate him and then I got changed.
too!

1413
01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:25.240
I admit it! It wasn't my fault.
I was just a cat.

1414
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.440
Are you sorry?
Sorry?

1415
01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.000
Cats are never sorry.
They never regret anything!

1416
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.360
Cats are never sorry.
They never regret anything!

1417
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.240
Except... Except. I do!

1418
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.000
Then. it is all right. Probably.

1419
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.680
Then. it is all right. Probably.

1420
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.920
Yo. Maurice! Give me a hand!

1421
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.520
Quick!Right. let's get out of here
once and for all!

1422
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.800
What's wrong?
There...

1423
01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.880
Hello there!

1424
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.000
Oh! Retreat!

1425
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.640
Oh! Retreat!

1426
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.240
Back away. everyone!Oh. please.
don't run off! You've just arrived.

1427
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.000
Enough with the masquerade!
Show yourself!

1428
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.520
Enough with the masquerade!
Show yourself!

1429
01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.640
Oh. you want to see me?

1430
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.840
Well.

1431
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.000
here I am!

1432
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.840
here I am!

1433
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.000
Agh!

1434
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.480
Agh!

1435
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.960
Do you see me. white rat.
in your misty eyesight?

1436
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yes. you do see me.

1437
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yes. you do see me.

1438
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.000
And now. come to me.

1439
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.840
And now. come to me.

1440
01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.520
my little bunnies!

1441
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.000
What is happening?
I don't know!

1442
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.040
What is happening?
I don't know!

1443
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.800
Busy day?

1444
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.360
No. come on. everyone.
You have to fight it!

1445
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.880
He's too strong!

1446
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.000
Maurice. you could get away.

1447
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.600
Maurice. you could get away.

1448
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.400
No! No! I-I would rather stay
and stand with my friends.

1449
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.000
Er. no. actually.
you could probably get away.What?

1450
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.280
Er. no. actually.
you could probably get away.What?

1451
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.440
And go get help.But we still give
you credit for your noble stance.

1452
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.080
But I...

1453
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.720
Ah. that fluffy tail is probably
the last we'll ever see of him.

1454
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.000
Yep.Bye-bye.Good riddance!
Ahem! Pardon me!

1455
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.480
Yep.Bye-bye.Good riddance!
Ahem! Pardon me!

1456
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.360
Can we continue? Fine.

1457
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.400
Come to me!

1458
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.000
Maurice!
Keith!

1459
01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.400
We've got the Pied Piper's pipe
and we're headed back to town.

1460
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.000
Good! I'm off to find
Keith and Malicia

1461
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.480
Good! I'm off to find
Keith and Malicia

1462
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.760
and lead them back
to battle the Rat King!

1463
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.560
Yes! Go! Go!Right! Go! Go!
OK. bye!

1464
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.400
Yeah. let's call that
a heat-of-the-moment fail.

1465
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.000
Yes. that never happened.Let's never
mention that. ever. to anyone.

1466
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.240
Yes. that never happened.Let's never
mention that. ever. to anyone.

1467
01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.840
Deal! So one more time.

1468
01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.000
Maurice! We have the pipe!

1469
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.840
Maurice! We have the pipe!

1470
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.960
The Rat King is on the attack!
Follow me!

1471
01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.680
Come!

1472
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.960
COME!

1473
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.880
Hey. watch out!
Oh. no!

1474
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.600
Together. we will be strong!

1475
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.000
Oh. no!

1476
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.840
Oh. no!

1477
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.680
I got you!

1478
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.200
Your offer is interesting.

1479
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.000
but what of those who aren't strong?

1480
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.680
but what of those who aren't strong?

1481
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.480
Agh!

1482
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.920
Delicious!
This tickles!

1483
01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.000
Delicious indeed! The weak are food.
That is how it has always been.

1484
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.640
Delicious indeed! The weak are food.
That is how it has always been.

1485
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.000
A-ha-ha!
Things are becoming clearer.

1486
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.120
A-ha-ha!
Things are becoming clearer.

1487
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.400
No! Ugh! Fight him! For our lives!

1488
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.280
For our future!

1489
01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.000
Yes. join us! I have great plans!

1490
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.880
Yes. join us! I have great plans!

1491
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.800
You only have plans!
Well. I have dreams!

1492
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.000
You defy me?

1493
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.480
You defy me?

1494
01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.680
Excuse me?!
What was that?

1495
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.480
Over here!

1496
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.000
You?! Mayor's daughter.
ya foolish child!

1497
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.960
You?! Mayor's daughter.
ya foolish child!

1498
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.040
Will you please be quiet?

1499
01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.000
What?Your voice. it's so loud!
Just shut up!

1500
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.360
What?Your voice. it's so loud!
Just shut up!

1501
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.680
I'm trying to hear the music.

1502
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.040
Music?

1503
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.760
That's right. Music.

1504
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.000
A collection of tonal vibrations
of varying durations.

1505
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.600
A collection of tonal vibrations
of varying durations.

1506
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.800
arranged in a pleasant.

1507
01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.440
some might even say compelling.
order.

1508
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.840
No! No! Agh!

1509
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.000
Malicia.
are you sure this is going to work?

1510
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:40.200
Malicia.
are you sure this is going to work?

1511
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.480
But of course. You just wait.

1512
01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.840
Humans...
Humans are the vermin of this world.

1513
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.000
Aaaggghhh!

1514
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.280
Aaaggghhh!

1515
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.960
Keith!

1516
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.680
Humans have tortured and poisoned
and killed.

1517
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.000
and all of that is now given form
in me.

1518
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.280
and all of that is now given form
in me.

1519
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.040
We must live alongside the humans!

1520
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.000
They trap and course us
for pleasure.

1521
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.360
They trap and course us
for pleasure.

1522
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.760
We will teach them to respect
who we are.Arrrgh!

1523
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.000
Oh. yes. we will.

1524
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:28.200
Oh. yes. we will.

1525
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.560
With fear!

1526
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.280
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1527
01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320
Oy! Keith!

1528
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.000
Oh. why didn't it work?

1529
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.280
Oh. why didn't it work?

1530
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.920
Keith. this is your story arc.

1531
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.000
Remember what you've learned
and use it!

1532
01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.000
But I haven't learned anything!

1533
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.160
But I haven't learned anything!

1534
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.240
Go get him!
Ugh! OK!

1535
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.440
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!
Nourishing!

1536
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.000
This suuuucks!

1537
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.560
This suuuucks!

1538
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.280
Ugh!

1539
01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.720
Whaaaa!

1540
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.280
Oof!
Ugh!

1541
01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.000
Sardines! Stop!

1542
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.840
Sardines! Stop!

1543
01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.920
I'm taking my final bow!

1544
01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.600
Ugh!

1545
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.000
And we would rule
that rat world together.

1546
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.880
And we would rule
that rat world together.

1547
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.000
would we?

1548
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.640
We would... co-operate.

1549
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.000
Yeah. right!
You co-operate. he rules!

1550
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.280
Yeah. right!
You co-operate. he rules!

1551
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.920
Smart cat.

1552
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.000
The stupid kid is making me
seriously angry!

1553
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.920
The stupid kid is making me
seriously angry!

1554
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.440
One moment.

1555
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.040
Oh. you really shouldn't have!

1556
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.000
You obviously do not know

1557
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.000
how a proper showdown ends
for the bad guy!

1558
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.040
how a proper showdown ends
for the bad guy!

1559
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.280
You'll be...

1560
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.240
..destroyed!
Malicia!

1561
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.000
You talk too much!

1562
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.920
You talk too much!

1563
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.000
Now. where were we?
Oh. yes.

1564
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.160
Join me!

1565
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.000
Malicia?

1566
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.160
Malicia?

1567
01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.480
Mm?

1568
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.960
Keith!

1569
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I'm sorry. the pipe.
it's not working.

1570
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.880
I'm sorry. the pipe.
it's not working.

1571
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.640
It's not the pipe. stupid.

1572
01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.000
Huh?

1573
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.880
Huh?

1574
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.920
Just play.

1575
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.160
OK.

1576
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.720
You will obey me!

1577
01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.360
Never!

1578
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.840
Then. feel my pain!

1579
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.560
Er... Mm...

1580
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.000
W-What's that?

1581
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.200
W-What's that?

1582
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.480
Oh. it's. er...

1583
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.880
You!

1584
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.000
Huh?

1585
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.200
Huh?

1586
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.400
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1587
01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.000
Uh! Uh! No. no! Enough! Enough!

1588
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.960
Uh! Uh! No. no! Enough! Enough!

1589
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.240
Enough!

1590
01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.760
Ahh. it's beautiful!

1591
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.200
Sweet music!

1592
01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.000
Sweet. sweet music.

1593
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.560
Sweet. sweet music.

1594
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.840
Over here! Hurry!

1595
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.000
Everybody. this way. fast!

1596
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.880
Everybody. this way. fast!

1597
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.320
Looks like someone discovered
his secret power.

1598
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.280
That is beyond ugly!

1599
01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.160
Well played. Piper.

1600
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.000
Well played!
But your music cannot break...

1601
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.960
Well played!
But your music cannot break...

1602
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.120
..me!

1603
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.000
Come now. Dangerous Beans.
It is time.

1604
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.640
Come now. Dangerous Beans.
It is time.

1605
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.000
No! You are nothing but darkness!

1606
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.400
No! You are nothing but darkness!

1607
01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.680
And you are nothing but a rat!

1608
01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.520
I am more than a rat!

1609
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.000
If I am not more than a rat.

1610
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.120
If I am not more than a rat.

1611
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.680
I am nothing at all!

1612
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.000
Then. be...

1613
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.360
Then. be...

1614
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.520
..nothing.

1615
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.680
Agh!

1616
01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.160
Maurice. my friend.

1617
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.720
maybe now it's a good time to be...

1618
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.880
..just a cat.

1619
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.000
You see.

1620
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:00.120
You see.

1621
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.040
the Amazing Maurice. that's me.

1622
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.360
had longed to be a proper cat
for months.

1623
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.000
I have so much bottled-up
ancestral fight and viciousness

1624
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.440
I have so much bottled-up
ancestral fight and viciousness

1625
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.000
flowing through my veins.
it sparks off my claws!

1626
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.320
flowing through my veins.
it sparks off my claws!

1627
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.400
The Rat King sends all of his power.

1628
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.000
enough to bring down a tiger!

1629
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.320
enough to bring down a tiger!

1630
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.080
But now. just for a few seconds.

1631
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.000
this particular cat
could bring down a tiger

1632
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.440
this particular cat
could bring down a tiger

1633
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.000
all on...

1634
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.720
..his own!

1635
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.400
Eurgh!

1636
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.960
Rrrggghhh!

1637
01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.840
Beans! No!

1638
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.000
Did you save him?

1639
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.600
Did you save him?

1640
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.880
I tried to save him.

1641
01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.520
Beans?

1642
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.000
Beans?!
Dangerous Beans?

1643
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.320
Beans?!
Dangerous Beans?

1644
01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.760
Please. no!

1645
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.120
Bone Rat.
Also known as The Grim Squeaker.

1646
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.000
You've come for Dangerous Beans.
I suppose?

1647
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.600
You've come for Dangerous Beans.
I suppose?

1648
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.120
No. After all we've been through?
Not gonna happen!

1649
01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.760
Argh!

1650
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.640
All right. mister.

1651
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.320
let's hear you talk.

1652
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.000
I'll give you one chance.
Unnn!

1653
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.280
I'll give you one chance.
Unnn!

1654
01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.640
Desist from attacking my associate.
Morris.

1655
01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.880
That's Mauriiiiice!

1656
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.000
Yes. sir! Mr Death!

1657
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.840
Yes. sir! Mr Death!

1658
01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.680
Yes. at once. sir.

1659
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.040
Oof!

1660
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.000
Good to see you again. Morris.

1661
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.560
Good to see you again. Morris.

1662
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.400
Hello. sir. Good to see you again.
too.

1663
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.000
How many lives do you have left now?
Erm...

1664
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.160
How many lives do you have left now?
Erm...

1665
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.120
Lemme think. Er. six. sir! Six.
Very definitely six lives. sir.

1666
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.000
But you were run over by a cart
only last month. weren't you?

1667
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.440
But you were run over by a cart
only last month. weren't you?

1668
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.800
Oh. that. sir? No.
Buh-Barely grazed me.

1669
01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.000
Got away with hardly a scratch. sir.
Exactly.

1670
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.120
Got away with hardly a scratch. sir.
Exactly.

1671
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.800
O-Oh. Oh. I... Yeah. I see.

1672
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.960
That makes five lives. Morris.

1673
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.080
Sir. please.

1674
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.920
take two of my lives.

1675
01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.000
I would give an extra one
in exchange for the life

1676
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.320
I would give an extra one
in exchange for the life

1677
01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.320
of this brave little rat.

1678
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:12.000
That is very un-cat-like of you.
Morris. I'm amazed.

1679
01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.520
Well. I'm pretty shocked too. sir.

1680
01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.080
It's just that this one is special.

1681
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.000
Wise and inspiring.

1682
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.920
Wise and inspiring.

1683
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.920
Your request will be granted.

1684
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.000
We came for two lives
and two we will take.

1685
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.880
We came for two lives
and two we will take.

1686
01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.120
The balance is preserved.

1687
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.960
Thank you. sir!

1688
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Oh. sir? I'm not gonna remember
all this. am I. sir?

1689
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.920
Oh. sir? I'm not gonna remember
all this. am I. sir?

1690
01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.720
Because that would just be
too embarrassing.

1691
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.960
Of course not. Morris.

1692
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.160
Beans!

1693
01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.000
Beans!

1694
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:52.800
Beans!

1695
01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.080
Please say something!

1696
01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.840
Beans?

1697
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.000
Don't leave me!

1698
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.720
Don't leave me!

1699
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.960
Beans...

1700
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.560
Dangerous Beans!

1701
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.000
I thought you were dead!

1702
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.760
I thought you were dead!

1703
01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.400
I thought so. too!

1704
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.560
What?

1705
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.000
Hey!
Ah!

1706
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.040
Hey!
Ah!

1707
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.960
See. the couple of a story
has to kiss

1708
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
whenever there are people
celebrating around them.

1709
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.880
whenever there are people
celebrating around them.

1710
01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.080
But this is real life?

1711
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.760
And a story.

1712
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.000
Our story.

1713
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.400
Our story.

1714
01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.720
Well. in that case...

1715
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.240
Whoa!

1716
01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.960
Mmmm!

1717
01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.440
Mwah!

1718
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.920
Mm...

1719
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.000
Maurice. is that a purr?

1720
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.040
Maurice. is that a purr?

1721
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.000
"Ratty Rupert saved the day.
and Mr Bunnsy's hide!"

1722
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.240
"Ratty Rupert saved the day.
and Mr Bunnsy's hide!"

1723
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.680
"Well done. Ratty Rupert!"

1724
01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.000
..cried the animals of Furry Bottom.

1725
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.760
..cried the animals of Furry Bottom.

1726
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.000
And that is how the story
of Mr Bunnsy ends.

1727
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.280
And that is how the story
of Mr Bunnsy ends.

1728
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.800
"But how does our story end?"
you might ask yourself.

1729
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.320
Well. in the end.

1730
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.000
our story is all about...

1731
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.680
our story is all about...

1732
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.600
# Rats!

1733
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.400
# You've... got...

1734
01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.000
# ..rats! #

1735
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.840
# ..rats! #

1736
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.960
Bad Blintz has become
a tourist attraction!

1737
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.080
Ta-da!

1738
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.360
People travel from miles around
to visit.

1739
01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.000
And buy the souvenir mugs
and stuffed toys

1740
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.320
And buy the souvenir mugs
and stuffed toys

1741
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.520
and other things which have no use
whatsoever.

1742
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.720
other than to be bought
and taken home.

1743
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.000
There you go. dear!
The famine is over

1744
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.400
There you go. dear!
The famine is over

1745
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.920
and there's plenty of food
for everyone!

1746
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.000
And once a day.
the town's Pied Piper.

1747
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.520
And once a day.
the town's Pied Piper.

1748
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.440
whose name is Keith and. actually.
who kisses rather well.

1749
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.400
plays his pipes.

1750
01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.000
and the rats dance to the music
in a conga line.

1751
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.280
and the rats dance to the music
in a conga line.

1752
01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.280
Ah. Mr Clicky. my lad.

1753
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.000
How's the family today?

1754
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.040
How's the family today?

1755
01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.840
The rats have a town of their own

1756
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.640
and get free use of the library.

1757
01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.000
And even send their little rats
to school.

1758
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.320
And even send their little rats
to school.

1759
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.520
In other words.
rodents live happily.

1760
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.000
side by side. with people.

1761
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.320
side by side. with people.

1762
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:53.880
Just how Peaches
once dreamed it would be.

1763
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.000
Due to the efforts of Maurice.
the Amazing Maurice.

1764
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.440
Due to the efforts of Maurice.
the Amazing Maurice.

1765
01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.760
and his educated rodents!

1766
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.480
But mostly...

1767
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.000
..me!

1768
01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.120
Meow!

1769
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.000
# Hey. what you doing?

1770
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.200
# I got a pocketful of rhythm
for you

1771
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.000
# And if you don't know
what it is you should do with it

1772
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.960
# And if you don't know
what it is you should do with it

1773
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.440
# Follow me

1774
01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.720
# Follow me

1775
01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.240
# Hey. where you going?

1776
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.000
# I see you looking for your light
but you're glowing

1777
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.320
# I see you looking for your light
but you're glowing

1778
01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.720
# But if you take a look inside
then you'll know

1779
01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.680
# It's gonna set you free

1780
01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.000
# Set you free

1781
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:44.120
# Set you free

1782
01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.680
# Oh. sometimes we get it right
# Ah. ah...

1783
01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.600
# And we all get it wrong
# Ah. ah...

1784
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.000
# But you're always gonna fail

1785
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.720
# But you're always gonna fail

1786
01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:57.840
# At being someone that you're not.
