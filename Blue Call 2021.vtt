She's dropping.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.984
I don't know. her pulse is dropping.

21
00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:50.819
Haylee.

22
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:51.653
- We're losing her.

23
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:52.487
We're losing her.

24
00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:58.326
- All right how long does she have?

25
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.329
How long does she have!

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.789
- I'm sorry.

27
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.165
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.507
- Clear.

29
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.495
- Shit.

30
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.289
- I'm sorry I snuck up on you sorry.

31
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.331
- It's okay.

32
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.167
- I just wanted to come
by and check up on ya.

33
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.794
I know that you just.
got back off of leave.

34
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.005
- Yeah. I'm doing good.

35
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.381
- Good.

36
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.632
And speaking of leave.

37
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.843
you know you still have some
more furlough time left.

38
00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.845
if you find out that you may wanna

39
00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.971
take a little bit more of it.

40
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.806
You know there is no shame.

41
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.850
Thompson's still using his furlough time.

42
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.476
- Yeah. I'm good.

43
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.103
I'm surprised TJ isn't back yet.

44
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.981
- You know when I was out in the field.

45
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.399
many many years ago.

46
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.651
I saw things that other people

47
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.195
couldn't even possibly imagine.

48
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.072
And to unsee the hard ones.

49
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:20.867
was the toughest.

50
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.203
That's our job.

51
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.038
That's what we signed up for.

52
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.040
- Yeah. Just glad to be back.

53
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.877
- Yeah. And coming back
from a demanding job.

54
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.838
that requires every ounce of us.

55
00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.175
and then to push past an event like this.

56
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.510
it really speaks volumes.

57
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.430
- Thanks.

58
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.806
- Mm. I'm glad you're back.

59
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.268
You're one of the good ones Green.

60
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.654
- Well you don't look like
total shit. so that's good.

61
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.623
Hi. I'm Haylee.

62
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.626
- Rodriguez.

63
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.961
- It's nice to meet you.

64
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.629
Mm-hmm.

65
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.481
- You're the one who
had the GSW kid right?

66
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.358
- Yeah.

67
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.113
- How long you been on the job?

68
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.323
- About a year and a
half since the academy.

69
00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.284
- That's cool.

70
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.663
So what. you woke up one day

71
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.873
and decided you wanted
to run into the shit?

72
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.253
I'll bet they sold you
the dream at orientation.

73
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.715
Fucking rookies.

74
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.846
- What happened to your last partner?

75
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.351
- I've been saving lives
in these streets for years.

76
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.645
Some people come and go.

77
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.275
After awhile. some people
just can't stomach it.

78
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.110
You know what I mean?

79
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.208
Ambulance 52. we got it covered.

80
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.338
Apartment 2F right?

81
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.173
Yep.

82
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.216
- Why don't they have a
fucking elevator in here?

83
00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.051
- Tell me.

84
00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.478
Hey you wanna get Chinese for lunch?

85
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:54.520
- Hell yeah.

86
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.105
- Sweet.

87
00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.945
Ashley was getting closer.

88
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.531
ever since we responded to
the call when I lost her.

89
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.826
I've never had one hit like that.

90
00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.830
Of course I've had people
pass away on me. but

91
00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:15.792
nothing like this.

92
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:30.598
- I swear to God.

93
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.225
there could be somebody dying in the back

94
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.267
and these assholes would still not know

95
00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.394
how to fucking drive.

96
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.189
Come on motherfuckers.

97
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.107
hit the gas.

98
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.859
Not
driving is the worst.

99
00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.486
Not because my new partner hates me.

100
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.989
but you're trapped in
the back nowhere to go.

101
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:49.617
The doors are sealed it's just you.

102
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.161
You. and the vice.

103
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.081
That's the scariest place of all.

104
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.008
I mean you move quick.

105
00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:06.843
- Yeah.

106
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.010

- Oh come on you'll see her later.

111
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:36.038
- Weird. do you think it's a ghost call?

112
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.002
- Dispatch this is 52.

113
00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.422
You're sure it's in the
alley Woodman and Fourth?

114
00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.550
Yes 52. Woodman and Fourth.

115
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.053
- Copy well. there is nobody here.

- Sass.

118
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.435
Thanks dispatch.

119
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.354
Probably some shits.

120
00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:02.482
Sitting in an office all
day while we're out here

121
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.524
risking our shit.

122
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.528
- Hold up. hold up I
think I hear something.

123
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.198
What you got like
dog hearing ears and shit?

124
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.832
Hmm.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.292
- Hmm I think I'm gonna call this one in.

126
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.502
Homeboy might be dead.

127
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.420
- Ah. that's all right.

128
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.254

129
00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:28.508
- Girl get your ass back here what the?

Always the white ones.

132
00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:34.055
Hello?

00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:41.979
Oh no. no. no. no.

Oh me?

141
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.278
What's your name?

148
00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:03.793
I'm gonna wrap your arm
with some gauze okay?

149
00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:04.627
Yes.

150
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:05.670

Hey. you're cute.

Are you an angel?

- I am not an angel.
- No. no don't. don't.

156

Still waiting on results.

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:01.267

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.465
- Oh I've had better days.

187
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.299
Mm.

188
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.092
- First day back I'm
cut open with a bottle.

189
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:40.139
- People like me and you
are cut out for this job.

190
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.391
Others they can't stomach it.

191
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.225
- Yeah.

192
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.980
- Headquarter is coming down on me.

193
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.567
- I figured we'd be having this talk.

194
00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.945
- They feel like you aren't ready and.

195
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.658
quite honestly I think I
may have made a mistake

196
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.076
in thinking that you are.

197
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.160
- What are you saying?

198
00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:05.831
- They want you to go in
for a full psych evaluation.

199
00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:08.125
Gets better.

200
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.169
And they're gonna put you
behind a desk for a while.

201
00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.045
- A desk?

202
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.341
- Well between the accident
and you not being ready.

203
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.676
this is. it's just talk for now.

204
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.012
- No Joe. Joe. I belong
in the field I save lives.

205
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.056
I run into shit that other
people can't handle it.

206
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:23.766
You're gonna stick me
behind a fucking desk?

207
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:24.725
- Look it's not me.

208
00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:28.062
Come on you know I went to bat for you.

209
00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:30.022
They overruled me.

210
00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:31.148
We'll reach out to your rep.

211
00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.609
- No. You tell them to
shove their psych eval

212
00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:34.860
up their asses.

213
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.529
I'd rather quit than do that.

214
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.406
- I knew you were gonna to say that.

215
00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.408
I'll have your rep reach out to you?

216
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.826
- Don't bother.

217
00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:43.828
I'm good.

218
00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.788
- Come on I know you're
gonna change your mind.

219
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:47.873
- No I won't.

220
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.131
- All right.

221
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.549
- Hey mom.

222
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.383
Haylee

223
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.551
I've been trying to reach you for days.

224
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:25.346
- Yeah. sorry I've been working a lot.

225
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.348
Haven't had time for anything else.

226
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.974
You've
been working crazy hours

227
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.018
I don't know how you do it.

228
00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.978
- It's not for everyone.

229
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:35.105
What's up.

230
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.942
Nothing.

231
00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.444
he said he was going over the few things.

232
00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:42.029
- AKA its been ship based.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.584
A boy. are you dating?

240
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:57.920
- No mom. no.

241
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.963
I gotta go bye.

242
00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.176
- Hey.

243
00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:06.554
- Hey.

244
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:10.099
I didn't expect to see you today.

245
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.100
- I can see that.

246
00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:13.936
You wanna go for a walk?

247
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.606
- Sure. just a second.

248
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.325
- All right I'm just gonna
come right out with it.

249
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.785
I should have done something.

250
00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:31.287
I froze. I fucked up.

251
00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:33.080
- It's okay.

252
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.292
- I was your partner.

253
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.710
I should have had your back.

254
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:41.589
I shouldn't have ever let
you go into that alley.

255
00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.924
- You told me not to. I didn't listen.

256
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.718
- I get it.

257
00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.052
I just still feel really shitty about it.

258
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:47.887
- Okay all right.

259
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.306
Let it go. seriously.

260
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:52.808
- I'm just glad you didn't die

261
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.143
or get Hep C or something.

262
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.104
- Yeah me too.

263
00:14:57.104 --> 00:15:00.190
- So Joe. he still feels
really guilty about all this.

264
00:15:01.108 --> 00:15:02.818
He went to bat for you.

265
00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:04.445
- I know I told him I was out.

266
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.530
- Well that's partially why I'm here.

267
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.115
He wanna give you another shot.

268
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.159
He wants you to come back.

269
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.286
- He couldn't come here
himself to tell me about?

270
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.454
- Well the last time you guys spoke

271
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:14.872
it didn't go too well did it?

272
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.043
Besides I wanna come check on you.

273
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:23.172
- Thanks.

274
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.841
- So we good?

275
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.051
- Yeah. we're good.

276
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.558
Ah man.

277
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:46.111
Wow look who it is smiley.

278
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.154
- Sorry I just wanted to say-

279
00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:49.198
- I just wanna stop you right there.

280
00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:53.077
I know what you're gonna
say but the truth be told.

281
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.621
you're a big fat pain in the ass.

282
00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:59.249
But these rooms haven't been
the same without you here.

283
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.086
- How'd you get him to reconsider?

284
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.462
- Come on Red.

285
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.130
you have been around as long as I have.

286
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.132
you know people huh?

287
00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:10.260
And with that comes a long laundry list

288
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.387
of bullshit and gossip.

289
00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:14.932
That she knew and I.

290
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.183
- I understood.

291
00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.852
Is Rodriguez here?

292
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:22.481
- No she's out riding
with her new partner.

293
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.024
- New partner?

294
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:24.858
- No I didn't tell you?

295
00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:26.485
We had to make some changes.

296
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.654
You would be riding with Kyle.

297
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.905
- Kyle?

298
00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:30.864
Scooter?

299
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.244
- Scooter.

300
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:37.871
Yeah.

301
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:38.706
No.

302
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.790
- Yeah.

303
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.500
- Oh fuck.

304
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.626
- Welcome back Red.

305
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.587
Scooter.

306
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:54.430

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.099
Hey move you're fucking car.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.184
Get out of the way dick head!

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:01.353
God damn fucking ambulance.

310
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:03.063
Come on!

311
00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:20.914
- Make a hole. make a hole.

312
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.626
- What did she take?

313
00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.837
- What the fuck did you take!

314
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.715
- She was shooting up the whole night.

315
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:33.052
She was shooting the whole night. Jesus.

316
00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.107
I'm fucking friends.

317
00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:49.401
What's you name sweet heart?

318
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:50.402
It's Haylee.

319
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.830
- Three dollar. ten
cents that's a good one.

320
00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:04.917
- Hey.

321
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.376

322
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.754
Hey!

323
00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:53.590
Wow.

324
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.802

325
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.720
- Freaked the fuck out of me.

326
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.890
Do you think cops already got in here?

327
00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:12.234
- Is someone here?

328
00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:28.041
I'm gonna. I'm gonna wrap
your wrist with some gurney.

329
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.501
- Don't you fucking touch me.

330
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.546
- I'm here to help.

331
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.547
That's why you called right?

332
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:34.965
You want some help?

333
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.258
- I don't want your pity.

334
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:42.806
- My name is Haylee.

335
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:43.640

Shanita Drink.

338
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.900
- Why did you cut yourself Shanita?

339
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.402
- Have you've been through
the ringer like I have?

340
00:19:56.778 --> 00:20:00.032
Just waking up. is tiring every day.

341
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:04.620
- Why did you call for help.

342
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.288
- I didn't call for help.

343
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.540
I called somebody I
didn't have to die alone.

344
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:12.794
- Hey let me just check on the cops

345
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.379
should have been here right now.

346
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.758
- Yeah why don't you go get the gurney

347
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.135
and sign out with their ETAs?

348
00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.805
- Can I ask you something?

349
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.599
Have you ever wanted to die?

350
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.602
- Yeah.

351
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:29.811
Everyday for awhile now.

352
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.522
- I need you to do me a favor.

353
00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:35.275
- Get you to a hospital?

354
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.360
- No I need your help.

355
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:41.615

356
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.158

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.287
It went out. its more paining

358
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.163

359
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.125
Please let me go quicker. please?

360
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.713
- I can't do that.

361
00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:59.383
- I'm a 35 year old drug queen.

362
00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:02.177
who with stage four prostate cancer.

363
00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:04.429
My parents disowned me when I came out.

364
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.223
and its probably lost.

365
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.978
.

366
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.441
There is not much of a
lifetime for me to live.

367
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.825
- What you're talking

- Come on have some mercy.

371
00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:33.583

So he was deceased
when you went in there?

375
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.908
- She had lost a lot of blood.

376
00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:49.076
my partner went to get the gurney

377
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:52.621
so we could stop and go
but its was too late.

378
00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.337
- Do you see anything different sir?

379
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:01.922
- No she was a goner.

380
00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:10.389
- Well if you remember anything
else called the station.

381
00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:22.794
- Next time you decide to stock someone.

382
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.337
hold onto your shit.

383
00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:25.338
You dropped your ID.

384
00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.093
- That's the stolen property.

385
00:24:30.093 --> 00:24:31.678
you could be arrested for that.

386
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:33.388
- I'm returning lost property.

387
00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:34.848
I'm doing a good deed.

388
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.184
Besides no one would
believe you anyway junkie.

389
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.312
I need something from you.

390
00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:42.397
- I don't have any money.

391
00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:43.773
- I don't want your money.

392
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.776
I want something else.

393
00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:47.986
- Sex?

394
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.364
Come on I'm just joking.

395
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.369
- I want to meet your dealer.

396
00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:57.537
- Slade?

397
00:24:57.537 --> 00:24:58.788
No way he'll kill me.

398
00:24:58.788 --> 00:24:59.706
- Correction.

399
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:03.502
I will kill you.

400
00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.131
Put some fucking clothes on.

401
00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:20.644
- Hey Scooter.

402
00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:21.770
- What's up captain.

403
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.231
- Listen that suicide victim.

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.982
I'm gonna need a full
report from you and Haylee

405
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:27.901
by the time you started your next shift.

406
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.110
- Got it boss.

407
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.945

408
00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:30.946
- Yeah.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:32.781
- Suicide call.

410
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:33.782
Haylee how'd she do?

411
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.371
- She handled it like a pro.

412
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.250
- Okay. get some rest.

413
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.084
- Yes sir.

414
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.346
- Can I help you?

415
00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.139
- I'm looking for Slade.

416
00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:01.142
- He's not here. come back tomorrow.

417
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:03.311
- We're here to see Slade.

418
00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:04.312
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

419
00:26:04.312 --> 00:26:05.730
Let them in!

420
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:16.741
- Tommy.

421
00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.576
- Yes sir.

422
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.410
- A word.

423
00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:22.080
Brian Cohen AKA Shanita Drink.

424
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.124
drag queen who committed suicide.

425
00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:25.333
lab over report back?

426
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.793
- That's actually what I'm looking at now.

427
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:27.627
- Great.

428
00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:28.628
Let's put this one to bed.

429
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:29.462
- Yes sir.

430
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:32.591
- Sod.

431
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.262
- Well don't keep me in fucking suspense.

432
00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:40.181
- Well it says here that our
vecy he overdosed on Nembutal.

433
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.224
- Lethal injection?

434
00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:42.434
- Yeah.

435
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.810
- This definitely illegal.

436
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.478
And he gets to go down
to phone him though.

437
00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:47.314
- Should we suspect foul play at all?

438
00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:48.648
- I don't think so.

439
00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:50.692
I'll check with Grace at the lab.

440
00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:51.610
- Okay keep me posted.

441
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.444
- We'll do.

442
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.871
- Finn boy!

443
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:05.248
You better have my fucking money.

444
00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:07.751
- Yeah about that...

445
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.753
This is my friend Haylee.

446
00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.504
She's here to do business.

447
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:16.509
- Who needs an attack dog.

448
00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:20.889
When you got a girl that'll
just. cut your fucking nuts off.

449
00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:24.517
- Anything for you.

450
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.396
- Business?

451
00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:32.233
So what are you looking for?

452
00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:34.611
Oxy. some heroin. maybe some meth.

453
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:37.822
- I need Nembutal.

454
00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:38.990
- What the fuck is that?

455
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:42.160
- You're a drug dealer and
you don't know a Nembutal is.

456
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.536
- Careful.

457
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:45.413
Your pretty face will get fucked up.

458
00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:51.127
- It comes in liquid form and pill form.

459
00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:52.045
I need the liquid.

460
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:54.464
- What are you gonna do with it?

461
00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:56.466
- To bake a cake what's it to you.

462
00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:59.469
- I told you. I told you
this baby was feisty.

463
00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:03.515
I'll get you the Nembutal

464
00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.016
just how much are you looking for?

465
00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:07.102
- I need two boxes for now?

466
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:11.022
- Well it's not gonna be
easy and it won't be cheap

467
00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:13.316
but assuming you already know

468
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:15.985
that if you're looking for
someone to get it for you.

469
00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:16.903
- How much?

470
00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:19.948
- It's gonna be two K now.

471
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:24.953
and you own me what phenols or no deal.

472
00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:34.170
- Fine. how soon can you get it?

473
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.339
- Well this isn't your
neighborhood pharmacy

474
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.550
would you expect to just
browse around for an hour

475
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.427
and pick your shit up at my counter?

476
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:43.221
At least a few days to find that shit.

477
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.724
Check back in with me and Finn.

478
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.558
- Yeah.

479
00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:50.395
- Never walk back into my
place without my money again.

480
00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.397
I'll let my lady cut your cock off.

481
00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:55.900
You remember how lucky you are

482
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.986
your grandmother was good to me.

483
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.446
- You don't say you
actually do that will you?

484
00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:00.780
- You think I would break my word

485
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.991
in front of this beautiful creature?

486
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:04.659
- No.

487
00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.244
- I was fucking joking.

488
00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:09.247
No I already said it so
I can't take it back.

489
00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:18.590
Get the fuck out of here.

490
00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:32.520
- He was sacred

491
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.855
he was scared of me.
- Jeez totally scared.

492
00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:34.689
oh yeah.

493
00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:26.467
- Can we make a stop somewhere?

494
00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:28.970
- Yeah. let's go.

495
00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:36.269
- Can I ask you a question

496
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:39.063
you don't have to answer
if you don't want to?

497
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.148
- What is it?

498
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:44.152
- Obviously you have this
bad rep and everyone thinks

499
00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:45.320
your original ass hole.

500
00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.365
You don't seem that bad to me.

501
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:50.199
What's the deal.

502
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.120
- What do you want some backstory

503
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.247
into what has molded me into
the masterful hate machine

504
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:58.166
I am today?

505
00:31:58.166 --> 00:31:59.542
I don't fucking know.

506
00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:01.252
Some people are wired differently.

507
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:04.005
- Sorry I asked.

508
00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:13.640
- Tiffany.

509
00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:16.809
What?

510
00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:18.227
- Her name was Tiffany.

511
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:29.656
- Hi is Finn here?

512
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:31.783
Come in.

513
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:39.290
Thanks for coming I
know. you're busy at work

514
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.541
sorry to bother you.

515
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.169
- Are you in trouble.

516
00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:44.921
- No it's not for me.

517
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.508
It's on some people I care about.

518
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:49.342
- People?

519
00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:52.095
- Let me show you.

520
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:03.064
- You want me to take him to the hospital?

521
00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:06.484
- No. I need you to do your thing.

522
00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:08.277
- How the hell did you know about?

523
00:33:08.277 --> 00:33:10.738
- Hooked up what you have
sliding up here okay?

524
00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:12.865
I know what that shit is.

525
00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:14.200
Are you gonna help us or not?

526
00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:17.495
- Absolutely not.

527
00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:22.917
- Wait please. may I
speak with you in private?

528
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:35.013
That woman in the other
room is my grandmother.

529
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:38.474
My parents left when I was young.

530
00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:39.600
my father went to prison

531
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.602
and my mother was nowhere to be found.

532
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:47.150
That woman. she gave me something.

533
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.068
She gave me a purpose.

534
00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:49.902
- I can't-

535
00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:51.779
- That same woman. took Finn in.

536
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:54.449
He had terrible upbringing.

537
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:56.075
He had no guidance at all.

538
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.537
But when he was hungry or
he needed a place to stay

539
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.414
when the streets were cold.

540
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:03.708
grandma gave him something too.

541
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:06.753
- What's wrong with your grandfather?

542
00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:09.672
- He's gone.

543
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:12.133
My Nana God bless her

544
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.218
she doesn't have the heart to let him go.

545
00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:17.430
She always said. " I'll let me damned

546
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.848
if the bastard outlives me."

547
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.150
- Look my job is to help-

548
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.193
- If it's about money-

549
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.027
- It's not.

550
00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:34.113
- Finn told us what you do.

551
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.367
I don't know if it's
production for something

552
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:43.081
but my grandma wants to go.

553
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.373
She's had a really good life

554
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.250
she just wants to be with her husband.

555
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.588
- I don't know what Finn told you.

556
00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.340
but you got the wrong person for the job.

557
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.593
- Maybe you can have your
peace by giving others theirs.

558
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:13.778
- I'll do it.

559
00:35:36.175 --> 00:35:38.511
Are you sure you wanna do this?

560
00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:39.387
- Yes dear.

561
00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:42.515
When you've lived this
long and as well as I.

562
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:45.101
its best you realize
when you're time is up.

563
00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.230
- But you have a choice.

564
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.071
- My choice has been in this
bed next to me for 45 years.

565
00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.702
I counted the stars in bed for him.

566
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.791
- I want to have a love like that someday.

567
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.042
- Open your heart.

568
00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:12.253
good things can happen.

569
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:20.178
- When I do this.

570
00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:22.763
you'll receive a dose

571
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:24.223
that is two times the amount.

572
00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:28.519
It will be painless.

573
00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:31.480
it also be quick.

574
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.724
- It's time.

575
00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:40.716
- I'll need this hand.

576
00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:55.750
- Thank you

577
00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:28.991
- What the fuck took you so long?

578
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:32.620
- This is a personal thing.

579
00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:34.580
Any calls?

580
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.208
- Yeah I told him we were on
break and turn the radio off.

581
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.793
Dispatch is gonna love us.

582
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:40.878
- Fuck him.

583
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.171
- Oh shit okay.

584
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:45.466
You're good?

585
00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:51.013
- Yeah.

586
00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:04.068
- I won't touch that if I were you.

587
00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:08.489
- Sharp.

588
00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:09.323
- And then?

589
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:11.867
- Look who it is.

590
00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:16.330
- You have my shit?

591
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.418
- Whoa do I walk into your
house and start demanding shit?

592
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:22.169
- It's been a rough day.

593
00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:23.963
- Want a bump.

594
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:26.048
The pure shit from here to city point.

595
00:40:26.048 --> 00:40:27.633
- I'm good.

596
00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:29.802
- You know. this wasn't easy to come by.

597
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:32.138
You going to need anymore?

598
00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:34.765
- It's one box.

599
00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.850
- It's two for one.

600
00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:38.227
- One should do for now.

601
00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:46.986
- It's all there darling.

602
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:49.447
- Free piece of advice.

603
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:51.073
Keep an eye on those around you.

604
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.200
Junk is dead.

605
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.036
The scum of the earth.
but they pay the bills.

606
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:58.956
- I'll take my chances.

607
00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:03.169
Haylee.

608
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.172
I got a job for you.

609
00:41:08.924 --> 00:41:11.260
- My webcam days are over.

610
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.094
- It's funny.

611
00:41:12.094 --> 00:41:13.471
It's funny but Finn.

612
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.764
he told me about your
little side operation

613
00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:18.642
and it just so happens I need you.

614
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:23.272
- Interesting.

615
00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:25.774
Find somebody else.

616
00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:27.067
- I got 10 grand.

617
00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:29.236
and you make it quick.

618
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:37.578
- 10 grand and you stop selling to Finn.

619
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:41.499
- What'd you look at this bitch Feat.

620
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.083
Finn is a good customer.

621
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:46.128
I mean sure he's a little
late on his payments sometimes

622
00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:47.129
but still...

623
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.385
All right. all right.

624
00:41:53.385 --> 00:41:54.678
You gotta deal.

625
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.055
- She is a bitch.

626
00:41:58.474 --> 00:41:59.433
- Who and when?

627
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:19.453
Hey!

628
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:22.248
- I'm up?

629
00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:23.082
I'm up.

630
00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:26.210
- What the fuck are you doing here?

631
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.796
- Tried calling you. but you
weren't answering your phone

632
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:32.132
so I came by your place and
you left your door unlocked.

633
00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:35.803
- What did I tell you about
letting people know about me?

634
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.637
- I'm sorry.

635
00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:40.307
- What I do.

636
00:42:40.307 --> 00:42:42.351
I do to help people.

637
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.103
I'm not some goddamn hired gun.

638
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:46.564
- The streets we're talking.

639
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:47.523
- Oh really?

640
00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:49.358
And why is that?

641
00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.569
Is that 'cause you open
your big fucking mouth?

642
00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.488
Keep your goddamn mouth shut

643
00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:56.532
or the next time I find
you asleep on my couch

644
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:57.533
you won't wake up.

645
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:01.662
Go home!

646
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:02.830
- I don't know where to go.

647
00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:12.965
- Sorry for your loss Mrs Cohen.

648
00:43:12.965 --> 00:43:14.633
- Thank you.

649
00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:16.093
But this just doesn't add up.

650
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:19.513
- What do you mean?

651
00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:22.349
- My son couldn't have injected himself.

652
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:24.310
he was afraid of needles as a kid.

653
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.769
And he didn't do drugs.

654
00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:29.356
- But even people in their
most vulnerable state

655
00:43:29.356 --> 00:43:31.567
overcome fears and do drastic things.

656
00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:35.279
- With all due respect sir. my
son may have slid his wrists.

657
00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:38.198
but he did not inject himself.

658
00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:40.200
- Mrs. Cohen. I assure you

659
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.702
we're not ruling anything out.

660
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:47.416
- I may not have been the
best mother in the world.

661
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:48.876
but I did love my son.

662
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:53.505
- Hey those shifts are long man.

663
00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:55.799
- I guess you got lives to save

664
00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:59.053
- By the way you still owe
me from Slade the other night

665
00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:00.346
so basically I'm repent.

666
00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:03.849
- Oh come on. I can't be tricked out.

667
00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:05.267
Not like...

668
00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:06.727
I'm more of a finesse guy okay.

669
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:09.229
- Oh yeah you showed a lot
of finesse the other night.

670
00:44:09.229 --> 00:44:10.814
- Well yeah that was with Slade.

671
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:12.941
- He's not a problem.

672
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:15.194
it's the shit back sidekick
you should be worried about.

673
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:16.945
- Oh no. you don't know Slade.

674
00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:19.698
You weren't from this neighborhood Haylee.

675
00:44:19.698 --> 00:44:22.910
you don't know the kind of
people he used to roll with.

676
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.536
They're not the kind of
people you wanna mess with.

677
00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:26.163
All right. they do things.

678
00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:26.997
They know people.

679
00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.332
- Yeah we all know people.

680
00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.709
Some are just worse than others.

681
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:31.543
- Now what?

682
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.171
Look the people he was rolling with

683
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.923
and was coming up. they're bad.

684
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:37.007
You don't mess with them.

685
00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:40.511
You just do what they
say. keep your head down.

686
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.679
don't ask any questions.

687
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:42.888
It's safer that way.

688
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:47.017
- What happened to you?

689
00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:50.104
- I don't really wanna talk about it.

690
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:51.980
- Stay with me.

691
00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:54.858
- Thanks.

692
00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.904
I don't really owe you do I?

693
00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:01.448
- Yeah you do. for the coffee.

694
00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:02.449
Shit I gotta go.

695
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.618
- Oh. okay.

696
00:45:04.618 --> 00:45:05.869
- Come on.

697
00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:06.662
Pick it up.

698
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:23.137
- This worst week has been crazy.

699
00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:25.556
I should be there in like...

700
00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:29.184
I'll be there in like 10 minutes.

701
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.271
Okay get a drink ready for me.

702
00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:35.023

703
00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.827
- Do you wanna get a...

704
00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.747
Do you wanna get a hamburger
or something later?

705
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.290
I'm dying for a whole day.

706
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:53.542
- Yeah sure.

707
00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.712
- What's the matter?

708
00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:57.546
- What do you mean?

709
00:45:57.546 --> 00:46:00.632
- Somehow you usually
disgusting  by now.

710
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:03.802
- I'm sorry. my mind
is just somewhere else.

711
00:46:03.802 --> 00:46:04.720
- Spill it.

712
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.598
Come on. Haylee we're in this together.

713
00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:15.022
- Do you ever wonder
what the point of it is?

714
00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:16.940
Do you ever wonder why we are here?

715
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.319
- Yeah. Easy to get fucked and pay taxes.

716
00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:23.864
911. what's your emergency.

717
00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:24.948
- I need help.

718
00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:25.783
Where are you?

719
00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:27.117
Do you need medical assistance?

720
00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.203
.

721
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.913
I don't know.

722
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:33.248
I don't know where I am.

723
00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.375
You gotta see now for yourself.

724
00:46:35.375 --> 00:46:38.295
.

725
00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:40.798
- All that evil in the world.

726
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.090
The drugs. the violence.

727
00:46:43.175 --> 00:46:44.426
What's the point of it all?

728
00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:48.889
- Just ride it out till you know.

729
00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.766

- You take care of it?

867
00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:34.010

880
00:59:35.154 --> 00:59:37.073
- I went to McCormick Avenue.

881
00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:37.949
I picked up your guy.

882
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:40.243
What you failed to tell
me he's a fucking cop.

883
00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.619
- I don't know what you're talking about

884
00:59:41.619 --> 00:59:43.413
'cause you were supposed
to put my cousin Jimmy

885
00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:45.123
out of his misery.

886
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:46.207
He's in renal failure

887
00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:48.585
and not a good candidate for a transplant.

888
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.044
So he waits for you and waits for you

889
00:59:50.044 --> 00:59:51.462
and you never show up here.

890
00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:52.672
- You're a fucking liar.

891
00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.303
- Watch the video.

892
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:03.850
Gosh I'm the
only one fucking here.

893
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.351
where is this bitch?

894
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:07.103
- I don't know who you grabbed.

895
01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.313
you fucked up.

896
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.606
- Stupid bitch.

897
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.898
- I will fucking kill you.

898
01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:11.733
- Oh lets go.

899
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.860
- All right okay she's dangerous.

900
01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.694
Sit down.

901
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:19.907
Now if we all just. take a hit.

902
01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:22.327
- I don't do drugs.

903
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.911
- You don't do drugs?

904
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.748
You got no problem shoving
into everyone else's veins?

905
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:27.790
Take the hit.

906
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.947
- Last night. nobody touched you.

907
01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:36.859
- Sorry about that.

908
01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.027
- Probably later today huh?

909
01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:38.861
- Yeah.

910
01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.448
Estimated time of death?

911
01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:44.409
- I would say he's been
dead for about a week.

912
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.370
Judging by insect activity on
them. wounds on his abdomen.

913
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.331
and general decomposition of his body.

914
01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.167
- May I?

915
01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.837
- Yes detective.

916
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.345
- Fucking sons of bitches.

917
01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:05.179
- You all right?

918
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.100
- Can I get a minute?

919
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:09.934
- Sure.

920
01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:15.398
Hey doc.

921
01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.357
Yes detective.

922
01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:17.483
- When you did the autopsy

923
01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:19.527
do you guys find any drugs in the system?

924
01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.489
- Actually yes.

925
01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.825
There are traces of
Nembutal in the system.

926
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.201
It's possibly he overdosed.

927
01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:29.746
but I'll need a few more tests to confirm.

928
01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:32.832
- Thank you.

929
01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:54.812
Ambulance 52.

930
01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:59.817
.

931
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.822
- This is ambulance 52. 10-four.

932
01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:05.782
You ready for this?

933
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:07.617
- Yeah.

934
01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.998
- This is the place right?

935
01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:16.292
- Yeah. that's what Slade said.

936
01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:18.211
- Anybody home?

937
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.089
- I don't know he didn't say.

938
01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.816
- When we get up out of there.

939
01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.193
you better come through on
that ounce you promised.

940
01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.070
- Yeah I will.

941
01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.364
I'm a man of my word.

942
01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.078
Have you actually ever killed anyone?

943
01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.579
- See you shaking a gun.

944
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:57.333
that gun we had. don't worry.

945
01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:58.167
It gets easier.

946
01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.337
Once you pull up on a motherfucker.

947
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.048
you tug that trigger.

948
01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:06.634
you're in control.

949
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.845
You got all the power.

950
01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.432
You gotta be a shark. hunting for blood.

951
01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:15.560
You feel me?

952
01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:18.396
- Yeah. I feel you.

953
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:20.439
I can do that.

954
01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:22.775
I can handle that.

955
01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.902
- Yeah. Oh. someone right there.

956
01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:39.375
- Oh fuck it is her.

957
01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.714
- Did someone call for an ambulance?

958
01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.090
- You man you gotta go.

959
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:46.924
Come on. go get him.

960
01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.385
- Yeah. just give me a second all right.

961
01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.428
I don't wanna fuck this up.

962
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.054
- Go right fucking now.

963
01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:52.889
How are they gonna know

964
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.181
there is nobody in the fucking house.

965
01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:56.726
- I swear to God it's one
of those dick bag teenagers

966
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.269
I'm gonna lose it.

967
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:59.979
- Dispatch this is ambulance 52.

968
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.899
I didn't get any response to the resident

969
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.902
I just wanna confirm the
address is 36 Burn side Lane.

970
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.070
over.

971
01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.114
- I don't see anybody.

972
01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:13.534
- You little pussy ass motherfucker.

973
01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:15.244
Give me that gun.

974
01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.622
If I kill him myself Slade
is gonna kill your ass.

975
01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:18.456
- Hey Drake!

976
01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.249
Drake don't it. don't...

977
01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.250
Fuck!

978
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.084
Fuck!

979
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.798
- I think we should go
back to the bus yeah?

980
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.355
- Scooter!

981
01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:45.399
- Did you do it?

982
01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:46.984
- I don't know if I fucking
kill him. I fucking did it.

983
01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:48.235
- Keep your pressure right here.

984
01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:50.363
Keep it handled the wound.

985
01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.364
Oh my God.

986
01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.500
Stay with me.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.168
It's okay.
- I'm gonna die.

989
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.087
- You're not gonna die.

990
01:06:09.882 --> 01:06:10.716
It's okay.

991
01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.426
It's okay.
- Oh God!

01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:13.552

- Come on don't be mad at me.

1007
01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.151

1008
01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.235

1009
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.112
- Wait.

1010
01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:05.534
- I don't have time for this.

1011
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.747

Oh man what are you doing?

1015
01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:48.869
- It's science you will get it.

1016
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.165
- Wow that's fucking insane.

1017
01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:58.170
Don't do that. that's dangerous.

1018
01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:01.131
- Don't be such a fucking pussy.

1019
01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:14.478
- Okay. there is no way
that I'm letting you

1020
01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:17.064

1021

- Dude that's one for me.

1022
01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:29.952
- Whose the pussy now bitch.

1023
01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.458
- Dude that was such a big head.

1024
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.294
You're gonna be so fucked.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:50.055
Oh my God dude. give me a cigarette.

Fucking ass hole.

Fuck!

1031
01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.371
Yeah I need fucking help.

1032
01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:35.392
- Who the...

1033
01:12:35.392 --> 01:12:36.894
Who the...

1034
01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:37.728
What?

1035
01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:40.272
Who the fuck.

1036
01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.285
- Oh Tommy. it's been awhile.

1037
01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.542
Did you know that the
definition of a partner

1038
01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.170
is a person who takes
part in an undertaking?

1039
01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.175
- What's going on Haylee?

1040
01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.218
Why are you here?

1041
01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.803
What are you doing?

1042
01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:21.688
- The death of Ashley consumes
me like a fucking disease.

1043
01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:26.360
But you. you get to hide in
your house and ignore the world.

1044
01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:28.737
It's fucking pathetic.

1045
01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:29.947
Why can't I move?

1046
01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:34.493
- Oh I induced you with paralyzing drug.

1047
01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.871
- Please just let me go.

1048
01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:39.164
Please just let me go.

1049
01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:39.998
It's not my fault.

1050
01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:40.916
It wasn't my fault.

1051
01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.543
Please.

1052
01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:43.460
Please let me go.

1053
01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:46.964
You can still walk away from this.

1054
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.967
- I'm not walking away from anything.

1055
01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:53.470
I feel trapped.

1056
01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:57.224
I know you did too.

1057
01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:59.226
That's why I'm here to help you.

1058
01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.812
I'm here to help ease the pain.

1059
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.065
- You're crazy bitch.

1060
01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:17.286
- Yeah. I am.

1061
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.314
What are you doing here?

1062
01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:28.649
Eight dollars for fucking burial

1063
01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.025
are you kidding me?

1064
01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.694
Jesus Christ new management shit.

1065
01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:33.529
Hey!

1066
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.240
Hey what's the votes.

1067
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.033
- Oh relax I've seen worse.

1068
01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.326
Hey what about you?

1069
01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:40.702
What are you doing here huh?

1070
01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.835
- I'm hunting.

1071
01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:49.670
- Hunting?

1072
01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:53.131
- Hey well. speaking of.

1073
01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:55.676
see that girl at the end of the bar.

1074
01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.844
I think she's checking me out.

1075
01:15:57.844 --> 01:15:59.346
What do you think?

1076
01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.732
- Hey. it's on me.

1077
01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.194
- It's very kind.

1078
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.290
- Hi.

1079
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:27.124
- Hi.

1080
01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:31.628
What's you name?

1081
01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:35.591
- Mercy.

1082
01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.135
My name is Mercy.

1083
01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:42.180
- Mercy.

1084
01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.769
Mercy what do you say. you
finish that little drink

1085
01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.980
then we roll out of here?

1086
01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.710
- Hey buddy. is this
fucking your night too?

1087
01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.338
- Every fucking season.

1088
01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:40.405
- Don't worry.

1089
01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.658
I'm a paramedic.

1090
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:15.899
there'd be a last time

1091
01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:53.812
there'd be a last time

1092
01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:57.941
right through the heart

1093
01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:05.240
coming right from the start

1094
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:21.006
will see you around

1095
01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:37.707
creeping through the crowd

1096
01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:41.711
trying to ignore it

1097
01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:56.768
will be a last time
