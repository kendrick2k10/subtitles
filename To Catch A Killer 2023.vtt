all right? -Excuse me.

179
00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:24.613
- Through your nose.
Ma'am.

180
00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:27.529
Does this place look
like an ER to you?

181
00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:29.444
Right.
No.

182
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:31.011
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

183
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:32.360
- Don't worry about it.
- Just-just leave me.

184
00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:38.018
The explosion--
was it triggered remotely?

185
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.077
It's intact.

186
00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:57.472
Whoever's inside
had a copy of the key.

187
00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:59.561
We're holding
the residents in base camp.

188
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:01.563
At least the ones
we managed to hold on to.

189
00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:03.870
My first responders
got the others on tape.

190
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.741
Good thinking. What about
searching the condos?

191
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.003
I could bring federal warrants.

192
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:08.222
I heard.

193
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.180
17 flights and no gas mask?

194
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.356
You're wasting precious
medical time here. Falco.

195
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:14.663
In the middle of
a citywide medical emergency.

196
00:13:14.663 --> 00:13:16.534
It won't happen again. sir.

197
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:18.667
Forget about the warrants.
We'll just ask permission.

198
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.235
Anyone gets antsy.
they're the ones we want.

199
00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:32.724
All right. people. listen up.

200
00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:35.162
We're being joined
by Special Agent Lammark

201
00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:37.207
from the Bureau's
regional field office.

202
00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:38.992
The FBI is gonna be
assisting us

203
00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:40.820
with this investigation.

204
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.691
Thank you.

205
00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:45.868
Okay. within
the next few hours.

206
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:50.090
your desks are gonna be
flooded with data.

207
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.180
much of it inevitably false.

208
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.184
You're also gonna hear
a lot of opinions.

209
00:13:57.184 --> 00:14:00.100
But opinions
never caught anyone.

210
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.191
so it's important to keep
certain preconceptions in mind

211
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:06.802
while classifying evidence.

212
00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:11.372
"Mass murderers
want to get caught."

213
00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:13.940
Well. this one doesn't.

214
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.376
29 victims.

215
00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:18.901
Every shot found its mark.

216
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.383
No casings. no brass.

217
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:26.604
Not a single stray hair
or fingerprint.

218
00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:28.258
This guy is thorough.

219
00:14:28.258 --> 00:14:30.260
He didn't come here to die.

220
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.263
and he does not want
to be found.

221
00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:37.267
We're gonna disappoint him.

222
00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:49.192
You will hear this man
called a terrorist.

223
00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:51.368
But any terrorist organization

224
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:53.370
that could've
pulled that off...

225
00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:56.634
...they would rush
to claim credit for it.

226
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:58.375
So far. none have.

227
00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:04.294
You will hear this man
called a maniac.

228
00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:07.210
Shit. I agree.

229
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.561
Except the range
of personality disorders

230
00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:14.739
is so extensive that
it includes all of us here.

231
00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:17.177
Depression. anxiety.

232
00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:19.179
uh. schizophrenia.

233
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:21.442
- But...

234
00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:26.403
PPD. NPD.

235
00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.536
PTSD.

236
00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:31.321
We took every crazy
off the street.

237
00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:34.020
there would be no one left
to police them.

238
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.674
- So...

239
00:15:36.674 --> 00:15:41.505
to succeed. we're gonna
have to keep our minds open.

240
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:43.725
Don't start out

241
00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:47.468
picturing a racist or a Nazi.

242
00:15:47.468 --> 00:15:48.991
He's not a type.

243
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:51.559
He's a person.

244
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.169
Somebody loved him.

245
00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.824
Somebody trained him.

246
00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:57.957
Somebody sold him that gun.

247
00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:02.091
We find them...

248
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.659
we find our guy.

249
00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.400
Four...

250
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.923
The governor's given you

251
00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:09.185
all the resources
he can give you.

252
00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:10.317
There's nothing more I can do.

253
00:16:10.317 --> 00:16:11.883
I'm a federal agent.

254
00:16:11.883 --> 00:16:14.016
Highways are not
federal. I'm sorry.
- Ah.

255
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:15.887
Shutting them down
would only cause mass panic.

256
00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:18.455
No. the shooter
causes mass panic.

257
00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:21.458
Shutting down a highway
causes headaches.

258
00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.460
Headaches my governor
doesn't need right now.

259
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.506
REPORTER [over TV]: In shock.
the mayor has called for calm.

260
00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:27.203
If you see anyone suspicious...

261
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:29.466
"It's not a type.
It's a person."

262
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.642
What a hack.

263
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:33.427
No wonder
they kicked him out of D.C.

264
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:36.430
These people.
they're just born plain evil.

265
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.520
Evil is cutting off a bird's
wing just to see what happens.

266
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.826
This guy is
swatting mosquitoes.

267
00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:44.394
Whatever. We should
string him up by his balls

268
00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:46.135
from the top of a flagpole.

269
00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:47.963
That'll deter all the other
nutsos out there.

270
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.660
Officer.

271
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.358
Why don't you leave
the sentencing to the judge.

272
00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:53.577
Our job right now
is to catch him.

273
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:57.494
- Sorry. sir.
- Oh. it's okay.

274
00:16:57.494 --> 00:16:59.105
Nice to know
how I'll be remembered.

275
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:01.150
Any chance of
some fresh coffee?

276
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.544
This tastes like
transmission fluid.

277
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.459
Right away.

278
00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:07.113
Mm. I'll do it.

279
00:17:07.113 --> 00:17:08.592
It's okay.

280
00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:10.072
Excuse me.

281
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:18.994
Why'd you say that thing
about mosquitoes?

282
00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:25.131
- Oh. it was just a feeling.
- Based on what?

283
00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:29.483
I don't think this guy
is looking for destruction.

284
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:31.789
I think
he's looking for relief.

285
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:35.576
And do you have a feeling
that he's gonna do it again?

286
00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:37.795
Yes.

287
00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:39.667
Why?

288
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:41.277
Because he liked it.

289
00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:43.236
How do you know?

290
00:17:44.237 --> 00:17:46.108
He killed 29 people.

291
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.458
Otherwise. he would've
stopped at two.

292
00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:50.286
Well. why did he stop
shooting at all?

293
00:17:50.286 --> 00:17:53.811
I mean. why not kill 50? 60?

294
00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:56.118
Was it because
the fireworks stopped

295
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:59.339
and so there was no more cover
for the gunshots?

296
00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:01.167
- Yeah. maybe.
- Bullshit.

297
00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:03.517
Don't patronize me.
Tell me what you think.

298
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:07.782
I think he got his fill.

299
00:18:07.782 --> 00:18:09.436
No matter how good
the food tastes.

300
00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:11.699
you stop eating
when you've had enough.

301
00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:15.355
Till you get hungry again.

302
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.140
What's your name?

303
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.142
Eleanor Falco. sir.

304
00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:22.057
Lammark.

305
00:18:24.712 --> 00:18:26.540
WOMAN [on TV]: The number of
deaths by firearms in this...

306
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.411
MAN [on TV]: Maybe because
we leveled Iraq on a lie?

307
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:30.326
There's no
Second Amendment in China.

308
00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:32.198
Now you're
justifying mass murder?

309
00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:34.113
No. I'm trying
to understand it.

310
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.984
There's no
moral ambiguity about it.

311
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:38.029
The rate of death
by either suicide or homi...

312
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:39.596
...construct
elaborate narratives

313
00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:41.598
in which they get
to be the hero.

314
00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:01.966
Hey.

315
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.237
WOMAN [on TV]:
Pseudocommandos are terrorists

316
00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:12.890
without a known cause.

317
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.197
They become obsessed
with weapons and regalia

318
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:18.157
to make up for their own sense
of impotence and failure.

319
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.028
MAN [on TV]: They're often
victims of aggression

320
00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:21.595
during childhood
and development.

321
00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.249
especially from the people

322
00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:25.251
who are supposed to love
and protect them.

323
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.222
Sir?

324
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.962
Any trouble
with Lammark. Falco?

325
00:20:24.962 --> 00:20:26.050
Trouble?

326
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.487
Meet him at Lindenblatt's
at 6:00.

327
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.184
He wants to see you.
Didn't say why.

328
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:30.664
Fuck.

329
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:39.412
We are exposing
more people to more risk.

330
00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:40.848
It's out of the question.

331
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:42.023
You can forget about it.

332
00:20:42.023 --> 00:20:44.068
Jesse. haven't you seen "Jaws"?

333
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:45.679
Right now. you're the asshole

334
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:47.811
that's trying to keep
the beach open.

335
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:49.073
29 bodies.

336
00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:50.553
Well. they had 58 in Vegas.

337
00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:52.294
Next day. you had Celine Dion--

338
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:54.035
she's onstage. Caesars Palace.

339
00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:55.906
- The show's got to go on.
- Hello.

340
00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:57.908
That guy was dead.

341
00:20:57.908 --> 00:21:00.781
We have an Olympic-class
marksman running wild.

342
00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:03.174
The governor
is not closing hospitals.

343
00:21:03.174 --> 00:21:05.264
- is not closing down schools.
Fine. Of course.

344
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.353
Those we can deal with.
but theme parks.

345
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:09.180
malls. stadiums?

346
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.095
Yeah. well. we're not gonna
impose a curfew

347
00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:12.880
without a single clue.

348
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.360
What's the strategy?

349
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.231
"Until Lammark finds him"?

350
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:18.059
By now. the guy could be
in Minnesota.

351
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.756
- They're not closing Minnesota.
- Oh.

352
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:22.672
9/11. New York City--
they didn't shut it down.

353
00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:24.892
-Look. if you can't
deliver what you promised

354
00:21:24.892 --> 00:21:26.894
without shutting down
the whole damn city.

355
00:21:26.894 --> 00:21:28.548
- forget about it.
- Jesse.

356
00:21:28.548 --> 00:21:30.289
Calm down.

357
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.769
I can find him.

358
00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:36.077
What I need to know
is that you're onside.

359
00:21:37.383 --> 00:21:39.298
I got to go.

360
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:44.128
Mayor was still mayor
in the sequel.

361
00:21:44.128 --> 00:21:46.087
That's the lesson from "Jaws."

362
00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:48.219
- Let's revert later today.

363
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:50.396
I don't even know
what that means.

364
00:21:55.923 --> 00:21:58.752
Jesus fuck.

365
00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:00.406
Sir.

366
00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:02.364
Um...

367
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.887
is this a good time?

368
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:05.933
No. please. Please. go ahead.

369
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.240
These fucking people.

370
00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:15.638
It's almost as though
they designed a system

371
00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:18.424
specifically to drain
my energy away.

372
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:20.730
I don't get it. Don't they
want you to catch him?

373
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.471
Oh. yeah. By yesterday.

374
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.560
The problem is that
they think they know how.

375
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.562
Anyway. let's talk about you.

376
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:27.955
Coffee?

377
00:22:29.043 --> 00:22:30.740
Sure.

378
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.221
I can think of two reasons

379
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:35.441
why you might be getting
a good read on this guy.

380
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:39.009
You're potentially
a good detective.

381
00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:42.404
You're as fucked-up
in the head as he is.

382
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:45.233
Either way.
I'm doing everyone a favor

383
00:22:45.233 --> 00:22:47.583
by keeping you off the streets.

384
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:48.845
Oh.

385
00:22:49.846 --> 00:22:51.500
- Hey.
- Hi.

386
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.197
Look at you. buddy.
What's got you so slim?

387
00:22:53.197 --> 00:22:54.851
Cut out gluten.
It's a magic bullet.

388
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:56.418
- That gluten. huh?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:58.464
- Steak and eggs got gluten?
- No.

390
00:22:58.464 --> 00:23:00.640
I believe you've met
Jack McKenzie?

391
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.990
- As an investigator. frankly.

392
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.948
he's average at best.

393
00:23:04.948 --> 00:23:09.431
But when we get close
to that killer.

394
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.782
trust me.
we all want Mac around.

395
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.698
- Flattered.

396
00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:17.700
She staying?

397
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.789
I'd have to ask
for your transfer.

398
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:21.835
I'd be working for the Bureau?

399
00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:25.969
No. you'd be a liaison
between BPD and me. basically.

400
00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:27.884
making sure that I get
the information I need

401
00:23:27.884 --> 00:23:29.451
when I need it.

402
00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:31.018
I'm surrounded
by jackals and clowns.

403
00:23:31.018 --> 00:23:32.846
Krupp and Marquand are capable.

404
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.674
but they're gonna feed
everything back to D.C.

405
00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:36.153
I just need people around me

406
00:23:36.153 --> 00:23:37.938
that are smart
and that I can trust.

407
00:23:37.938 --> 00:23:41.376
Right now. believe it or not.
that's you two.

408
00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:44.292
So don't fuck it up.

409
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:52.126
Be an artist. not a cop.

410
00:23:52.126 --> 00:23:53.649
Use your intuition.

411
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:55.782
This guy's on
a spiral of destruction.

412
00:23:55.782 --> 00:23:57.523
I expect you
to slide down after him.

413
00:23:57.523 --> 00:23:59.307
I'm here to catch you.
You know that.

414
00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:01.483
You stay away from this girl.

415
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:04.138
Thank you. sir.
but I can protect myself.

416
00:24:04.138 --> 00:24:05.966
Oh. I'm worried about him.

417
00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:08.838
Okay. people.

418
00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:10.753
Let's go catch him.

419
00:24:10.753 --> 00:24:12.451
The block has
12 security cameras.

420
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.540
but the drive overwrites
every 72 hours.

421
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.498
Our guy got in before that.
we missed him.

422
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:18.369
There are also
significant blind spots.

423
00:24:18.369 --> 00:24:19.588
including the service bay

424
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:21.285
and the second-floor
hallway window.

425
00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:22.722
Now. Samantha's collating
all the incident AV:

426
00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:24.724
cell phones.
drone surveillance.

427
00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.508
It's about 300 hours
of footage.

428
00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:27.988
We should have it cleaned up

429
00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:30.164
and cut down in sequence
by 1:00 p.m.

430
00:24:30.164 --> 00:24:31.731
Can I see a rough cut at 11:00?

431
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:33.559
Absolutely.
The Realtor's checking through

432
00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:35.430
all of the walk-throughs
over the last six months.

433
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.301
He and his team will be
available for questioning

434
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:39.086
first thing tomorrow morning.

435
00:24:39.086 --> 00:24:40.783
Okay. painters. locksmith.
phone company.

436
00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:42.524
- Come on.
- No landline.
no cable. no Wi-Fi.

437
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:44.352
No one lived there.

438
00:24:44.352 --> 00:24:46.528
The owner had the place painted
before the pandemic.

439
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:48.225
We found the company.
We're tracing the men.

440
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:51.620
Um. Eleanor?

441
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.970
Uh. you-you're gonna get copies
of all these reports. okay?

442
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.363
Yeah. all right.

443
00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:58.279
Um... please.

444
00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:00.629
Señor Ortega has been a janitor

445
00:25:00.629 --> 00:25:02.326
at this building
since it opened.

446
00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:05.025
He's 54. Cuban. GPR negative.

447
00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:06.330
There's no guns. no record.

448
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.636
He claims he's never had a copy

449
00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:09.159
- of the keys.
Right.

450
00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:10.683
There's another janitor

451
00:25:10.683 --> 00:25:12.293
named Barraza.
works the night shift.

452
00:25:12.293 --> 00:25:14.034
He was off on holiday.
so he's unreachable.

453
00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:15.383
Where is Barraza?

454
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:16.993
He's not in the area.

455
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:18.691
I didn't ask where he isn't.
I asked where he is.

456
00:25:18.691 --> 00:25:20.127
Doesn't fit our profile.

457
00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:21.824
He's friendly. funny.

458
00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.130
Half of the residents
accused him

459
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.697
of smoking weed in the hallway.

460
00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.568
- What about the other half?
- They're buying it from him.

461
00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:29.049
- Lot of laughter. Krupp?

462
00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:30.833
We've I.D.'d
the building's residents

463
00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:32.400
- and instigated
background checks.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.793
Counterterrorism are processing
the profiles right now.

465
00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:35.185
Counterterrorism?

466
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.797
Frank Graber requested them.

467
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.104
I run the operation.

468
00:25:41.104 --> 00:25:42.802
Not Frank Graber.

469
00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:45.979
Not D.C. Certainly not you.

470
00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:47.371
They have twice our resources.

471
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:48.547
I thought you'd be on board.

472
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.591
I'm just trying
to speed things along.

473
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:52.028
I'll speed your ass
out the door.

474
00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:54.248
If Frank Graber
requests resuscitation.

475
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:56.076
you need my approval first.

476
00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.686
Okay?

477
00:25:57.686 --> 00:25:59.383
- That goes for everyone.

478
00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:03.605
What is it now?

479
00:26:04.737 --> 00:26:06.608
Confirmation that you are not

480
00:26:06.608 --> 00:26:08.044
requesting a curfew.

481
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:09.568
Jesse Capleton
asked you to sign.

482
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.352
Why would I sign something

483
00:26:11.352 --> 00:26:14.268
that's the exact opposite
of what I asked for?

484
00:26:14.268 --> 00:26:16.575
He said you agreed to
in the meeting.

485
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.360
- and now he needs you
on the record.

486
00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:23.756
Fucking asshole.

487
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:28.195
Okay. Marquand?

488
00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:30.240
Yes. sir.
Be straight with me.

489
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.720
Have you been talking
to counterterrorism?

490
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.939
No. sir.

491
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:34.114
Is it gonna stay that way?

492
00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:35.724
Yes. sir.

493
00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:37.987
Then what you got?

494
00:26:37.987 --> 00:26:39.380
Well. the shockwave analysis confirmed

495
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.729
the use of a hand grenade.

496
00:26:40.729 --> 00:26:42.252
It's an M14.

497
00:26:42.252 --> 00:26:44.385
He turned on the gas.
pulled the pin.

498
00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.474
- walked out. and he closed
the door behind him.
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:26:46.474 --> 00:26:48.476
There's also a lot of scratches
under the lock.

500
00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:50.565
Like he had
a big bunch of keys.

501
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:53.481
Now. ballistics has their money
set on an XM21 sniper system.

502
00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:56.179
Used in Vietnam.
right up to Desert Storm.

503
00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.181
They updated the scope in '75.

504
00:26:58.181 --> 00:27:00.836
but we think
it's one of the originals.

505
00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:03.752
If that's the case. we. uh...
we got a problem.

506
00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:05.275
What's that?

507
00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:06.973
The gun is older
than the database.

508
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.496
That means we're gonna
have to go old-school.

509
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.063
match each piece of evidence manually

510
00:27:10.063 --> 00:27:12.805
with military archives
state by state.

511
00:27:12.805 --> 00:27:14.981
- It's a fart in a hurricane.
- That's very poetic.

512
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:16.983
That's what my wife says.

513
00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:18.506
What does the Army do
with weapons

514
00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:20.160
that are no longer in use?

515
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.814
If they're in decent condition.

516
00:27:21.814 --> 00:27:23.467
they get kicked down
to local law enforcement.

517
00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:25.078
Some get dismantled.
others get redistributed

518
00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:26.557
to armed allied forces
around the world.

519
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:28.777
Who dismantles them?

520
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:31.258
Uh. the arsenal keepers.
Every base unit has one.

521
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.002
But who actually verifies
that they're destroyed?

522
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:38.874
You know what?
Get the keeper records.

523
00:27:38.874 --> 00:27:42.138
Active duty. prosecutions.
missing weapons.

524
00:27:42.138 --> 00:27:44.706
- psych trauma. PTSD.
We're on it.

525
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:46.621
We can all use more help. Nathan.

526
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:49.929
but I need collaboration.
not competition.

527
00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:51.974
There has to be
a clear chain of command.

528
00:27:51.974 --> 00:27:53.933
Personal question?

529
00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:56.022
Don't you think
Lammark's a bit paranoid

530
00:27:56.022 --> 00:27:57.719
about other teams
being involved?

531
00:27:57.719 --> 00:28:00.113
Not really.
Everyone's looking for credit.

532
00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:03.551
I've seen way too many cases
derail from friendly fire.

533
00:28:20.481 --> 00:28:22.396
My God.

534
00:28:29.925 --> 00:28:32.232
Tell me you got something here.

535
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:38.107
Height. weight. anything.

536
00:28:38.107 --> 00:28:41.545
That distance-- I can't even
start to speculate.

537
00:28:41.545 --> 00:28:44.244
Small entrance.
large exit on all.

538
00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:45.767
One shot per victim.

539
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.552
Head. chest. neck-- gone.

540
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:53.775
- All yours. my friend.
- Yeah.

541
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:56.430
You ever seen anything
like this. Mac?

542
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.606
Not outside the Army.

543
00:28:58.606 --> 00:29:00.303
Very few inside.

544
00:29:00.303 --> 00:29:03.263
I mean. you got wind.
fireworks distracting you.

545
00:29:03.263 --> 00:29:04.830
It's flawless.

546
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:09.182
Someone knows
how good this guy is.

547
00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:12.751
Military-trained
or high-level sports.

548
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.102
Either way.

549
00:29:16.102 --> 00:29:18.408
this is winning medals.

550
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.671
Is the shooter a man?

551
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.412
Yes.

552
00:29:22.412 --> 00:29:24.327
Why?

553
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:27.026
At this scale?

554
00:29:27.026 --> 00:29:29.071
Unprecedented.

555
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.986
Planned or spontaneous?

556
00:29:30.986 --> 00:29:33.728
Planned.
Spontaneous.

557
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.600
Then why did he have a weapon?

558
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:40.169
He was trespassing.

559
00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:42.824
Maybe he was expecting
the police.

560
00:29:42.824 --> 00:29:45.522
With a 40-year-old
sniper rifle?

561
00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:50.484
Different genders.
different races.

562
00:29:50.484 --> 00:29:54.836
Some old. some quite young.

563
00:29:54.836 --> 00:29:56.707
There's no pattern.

564
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.623
Why?

565
00:29:59.623 --> 00:30:02.844
Well. we can speculate

566
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:05.368
that nature's not to blame.

567
00:30:05.368 --> 00:30:07.370
Culture is.

568
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.677
We're all different.

569
00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:11.853
We still act the same.

570
00:30:11.853 --> 00:30:14.856
Rush hour. lunch hour.

571
00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:17.641
Black Friday. New Year's Eve.

572
00:30:18.686 --> 00:30:22.385
We just blindly follow
the same patterns.

573
00:30:22.385 --> 00:30:25.388
He's not punishing people.

574
00:30:25.388 --> 00:30:28.043
He's disrupting behavior.

575
00:30:28.043 --> 00:30:31.917
There's no torture.
no reveling in the suffering.

576
00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:35.834
Just a-- poof--
quick one-way ticket to Narnia.

577
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.054
Sir.

578
00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:40.795
They have him.

579
00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:43.015
What do you mean.
"They have him"? Who has him?

580
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.208
Frank?

581
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:06.473
I'm heading this up
till Nathan says otherwise.

582
00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:08.083
Hey. don't have a heart attack.

583
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:09.737
I'm not here to undermine you.

584
00:31:09.737 --> 00:31:11.173
- We just have to move fast.

585
00:31:11.173 --> 00:31:13.610
We're checking up
the residents.

586
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.830
and this kid rings alarm bells
all over the place.

587
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.528
We try to question him.
he locks himself in his room

588
00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:21.923
and threatens to kill everyone.
which is never a good sign.

589
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.403
OFFICER [over radio]:
Alpha Team. into position.

590
00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:25.318
Beta Team. clear the floor.

591
00:31:25.318 --> 00:31:26.928
OFFICER 2 [over radio]:
Do we have eyes on the weapon?

592
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:30.018
Repeat.
is the weapon confirmed?

593
00:31:30.018 --> 00:31:32.760
It was nice of you to invite
everyone before calling me!

594
00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:37.417
He ticks every box: ADHD.

595
00:31:37.417 --> 00:31:39.288
skips school
because he gets bullied.

596
00:31:39.288 --> 00:31:41.247
spends all night
watching ISIS clips

597
00:31:41.247 --> 00:31:43.379
and blowing out brains
on video games.

598
00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:46.687
And his uncle Aziz took him
to the gun club last summer.

599
00:31:46.687 --> 00:31:48.341
This is where the tenants

600
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:52.084
of 12 Redwood Street
are staying on your dime.

601
00:31:52.084 --> 00:31:54.651
Now it seems the killer
is among them.

602
00:31:54.651 --> 00:31:56.436
How'd he access the apartment?

603
00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:58.220
The Rahmanis--
they live above it.

604
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.396
He could've climbed to
the ledge. He knows the area.

605
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:02.181
Probably planned out
this whole thing.

606
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:03.312
SWAT COMMANDER [over radio]:
Ready to go. 20 seconds.

607
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:04.792
Copy that.

608
00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:16.238
Alpha Team. we're going in.

609
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.242
Do we know for certain
that he's armed?

610
00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:22.853
He said he was gonna
kill everyone!

611
00:32:22.853 --> 00:32:25.552
I asked whether he was armed.
not what he said!

612
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:27.597
There was a mattress
in that condo.

613
00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:29.643
Why would there be one
if he lived upstairs?

614
00:32:29.643 --> 00:32:31.993
Who is this?
Why is she even here?

615
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:33.995
It's okay. Eleanor.

616
00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:36.955
SWAT COMMANDER [over radio]:
In three. two. one.

617
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.957
Go. go. go!

618
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.088
Did you give the go-ahead?

619
00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:41.785
Back off. Lammark!

620
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:45.180
- Get down on the floor!
- Get down!

621
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.616
Where's the weapon?

622
00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:48.401
Stay the fuck
right where you are!

623
00:32:48.401 --> 00:32:49.924
- I didn't do anything!
- What the fuck are you doing?

624
00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:54.189
Get a life mat.

625
00:32:54.189 --> 00:32:55.712
He's going for the window!

626
00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:57.323
He's going for
the fucking window!

627
00:32:57.323 --> 00:32:59.890
- Get a life mat!

628
00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:10.901
Your tax dollars are
paying for their room service.

629
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:14.035
Now it seems the killer
has been among them all along.

630
00:33:24.654 --> 00:33:26.482
Where's the weapon. Frank?

631
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.486
So far. you haven't found
a catapult.

632
00:33:30.486 --> 00:33:33.185
He could've stashed it anywhere.

633
00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:36.884
You don't have a firearm.

634
00:33:36.884 --> 00:33:42.411
You're oceans away from
establishing any connection

635
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:46.981
to an old XM21 rifle
in particular.

636
00:33:46.981 --> 00:33:51.116
You don't get to become
a first-class marksman

637
00:33:51.116 --> 00:33:53.335
playing video games.

638
00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:56.469
So. you either find
some evidence here.

639
00:33:56.469 --> 00:33:58.123
make some sense of it.

640
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:01.474
or admit that this has been

641
00:34:01.474 --> 00:34:05.217
a colossal fuckup!

642
00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:06.827
Come on. Lammark.

643
00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:09.264
If it wasn't him.
how come he jumped?

644
00:34:09.264 --> 00:34:12.050
I don't know. maybe it's
'cause of that fucking parasite

645
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.748
Jimmy Kittridge calling him
a terrorist on live TV.

646
00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:16.576
Arab kid.
Baltimore high school.

647
00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:18.143
Do you think
he pictured himself

648
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:20.014
becoming homecoming king
after that?

649
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:22.799
Okay. but for now.
it could've been him. right?

650
00:34:22.799 --> 00:34:24.627
I mean. until
he's proven innocent?

651
00:34:24.627 --> 00:34:26.934
Jesse. it's supposed to be
the other way around.

652
00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:28.936
Not when we're competing
with six other states

653
00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:31.634
for a $9 billion gas plant.

654
00:34:31.634 --> 00:34:34.594
I need the people out there
to feel safe. Lammark.

655
00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:37.379
This shows them we're on it.
It buys us more time.

656
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:41.079
Are you gonna tell that shit
to the Rahmanis?

657
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.906
Go ahead. tell 'em that.

658
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:45.692
'cause I got
fucking work to do.

659
00:34:49.391 --> 00:34:51.089
Three painters worked
the apartment.

660
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:52.786
We've got Rodney Lang.

661
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:55.484
Abraham Haynes
and Dimitri Bovrov.

662
00:35:00.402 --> 00:35:02.709
Mr. Lang. this should be quick.

663
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:05.277
I hope you don't mind.
Uh. I brought backup.

664
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:08.976
Wife's working a double. so...

665
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.934
guess who's in charge
of little Desmond here.

666
00:35:10.934 --> 00:35:12.327
Desmond. huh?

667
00:35:12.327 --> 00:35:14.460
Had an uncle called Desmond.

668
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.594
Used to write erotic novels
under the. uh. name

669
00:35:18.594 --> 00:35:20.901
"Melody Bangs."

670
00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:23.686
Okay. -I suppose you remember
where you were last night?

671
00:35:23.686 --> 00:35:26.602
Uh. yeah. Actually. we...

672
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:28.604
went down to the harbor
to watch the fireworks.

673
00:35:28.604 --> 00:35:30.432
We were there. Scary shit.

674
00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:35.176
You got... you got proof?

675
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.656
- Proof?
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:38.658
We got proof. yeah.

677
00:35:38.658 --> 00:35:40.399
Like a million selfies.

678
00:35:40.399 --> 00:35:42.183
ABRAHAM [voice-over]:
At my mother-in-law's.

679
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:44.620
I thought you caught the guy.

680
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.275
Maybe. No pictures?

681
00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:49.016
Mm...

682
00:35:49.016 --> 00:35:50.670
ABRAHAM [voice-over]:
Of my mother-in-law?

683
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.672
Lots of pictures.

684
00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:54.587
Big party. Cousins. nephews.

685
00:35:57.807 --> 00:36:00.288
What am I doing here?
Am I a suspect?

686
00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:03.378
I just stripped
the fucking place.

687
00:36:03.378 --> 00:36:04.945
Two years ago.

688
00:36:04.945 --> 00:36:05.859
Hey. hey. hey. calm down.

689
00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:07.556
It's all good.

690
00:36:07.556 --> 00:36:09.123
Just asking you questions.

691
00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:13.432
I was at my apartment alone.

692
00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:15.390
Relax. Dimitri.

693
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.262
It's still legal to spend
a night alone in this country.

694
00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:19.133
- Can you prove it?

695
00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:23.485
My. uh. neighbor.
maybe he see me come in?

696
00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:25.879
And. uh.
I call my father in Russia.

697
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:28.098
Perhaps you can verify
with phone company?

698
00:36:28.098 --> 00:36:29.796
But you did get some...

699
00:36:29.796 --> 00:36:32.973
some military training
in Russia. right?

700
00:36:32.973 --> 00:36:35.715
Did you get
any shooting practice?

701
00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:37.891
Sir. I did not kill
those people.

702
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:44.289
I find it shameful that I need
to explain this to you.

703
00:36:44.289 --> 00:36:45.812
I'm an honest man.

704
00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:47.466
and I work hard
for what I have.

705
00:36:47.466 --> 00:36:50.251
Yes. I did shooting practice--
two weeks.

706
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:53.863
Then I break my arm.
so no good for shooting.

707
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:57.954
They tell me to go
clean barracks. so I sweep.

708
00:36:57.954 --> 00:37:01.567
I wash windows. and that is
how I serve my country.

709
00:37:01.567 --> 00:37:03.917
Mr. Haynes.
why did you stop working

710
00:37:03.917 --> 00:37:06.093
at DeLuxe Painting and Repairs?

711
00:37:06.093 --> 00:37:07.964
Maybe I wasn't fast enough.

712
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:10.097
You'd have to ask them.

713
00:37:10.097 --> 00:37:13.535
So. you...
you stripped the place.

714
00:37:13.535 --> 00:37:15.581
- Alone.
- Yes.

715
00:37:17.147 --> 00:37:19.106
What else do you remember?

716
00:37:19.106 --> 00:37:20.977
That light.

717
00:37:20.977 --> 00:37:22.588
The view.

718
00:37:22.588 --> 00:37:24.416
We worked the lounge together.

719
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.983
Then Dimitri stayed extra
for the bedrooms.

720
00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:28.724
I think.

721
00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:30.291
No. I did the bedrooms.

722
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:32.424
- I'm sure.

723
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:36.950
Eleanor. would you
consider it sexist of me

724
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.996
if I asked you
to take little Desmond here

725
00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:41.824
and put him to sleep?

726
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:48.570
Oh. Thanks. sweetie.

727
00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:00.060
Mr. Lang. you've got
quite the. uh...

728
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.583
the gig
in wall painting. right?

729
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.237
You're a regular at DeLuxe.

730
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:05.805
A string of work
for Ultraviolet as well?

731
00:38:05.805 --> 00:38:08.286
Well. uh.
kids don't come cheap.

732
00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:01.339
Hi. Excuse me.

733
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:03.471
Preliminary lab report.

734
00:39:03.471 --> 00:39:04.864
- Oh.
- Mind signing it for me?

735
00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:06.996
- Okay. Sure.
- Thanks.

736
00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:11.871
Awesome. Thank you.

737
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:21.794
No. guys. please. Guys!

738
00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:24.405
Do you want an investigation.

739
00:39:24.405 --> 00:39:27.060
or do you want
an entertainment event?

740
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:34.894
Hey. Eleanor.

741
00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:36.635
Did you receive
a package from the lab?

742
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:37.897
Yes. sir.

743
00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:39.986
I've included it in my report.

744
00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.857
The urine and fecal samples
were scarce.

745
00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:43.990
but there was still enough
to detect an iron deficiency.

746
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.513
I looked it up. and it's common

747
00:39:45.513 --> 00:39:47.515
amongst people
who don't eat meat.

748
00:39:47.515 --> 00:39:49.778
What time did it arrive?

749
00:39:49.778 --> 00:39:52.085
- I don't know. 20 minutes ago?
- 45.

750
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:55.915
I didn't have it.
so. uh. I rang the lab.

751
00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:57.917
- Checked with the courier.
- I'm sorry. sir.

752
00:39:57.917 --> 00:40:00.920
I was just trying to help.
You were on the phone. and...

753
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.402
This is specialized. urgent.

754
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:07.187
classified intel.

755
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:13.149
You are the BPD liaison.
a beat cop.

756
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:15.674
no college degree.
but you decide

757
00:40:15.674 --> 00:40:18.677
that I should wait
for your verdict.

758
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.533
Eleanor. I'm sorry I snapped.

759
00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:51.492
I had a ridiculously stressful
phone conversation.

760
00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:53.929
- I took it out on you.
- No worries.

761
00:40:53.929 --> 00:40:55.627
Hey. I know it's late.

762
00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:57.629
but I have. uh.
some new stuff to go over.

763
00:40:57.629 --> 00:41:00.109
and I could use
some of your brain.

764
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:01.807
Want to come have some dinner.

765
00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:04.331
talk it through
with a good glass of wine?

766
00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:09.902
Sir. if you hired me
so you could fuck me.

767
00:41:09.902 --> 00:41:12.731
you can take this job and
you can shove it up your ass.

768
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:15.081
Eleanor. I'm married.

769
00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:17.518
Come and have dinner with us.

770
00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:19.912
You look like you could use
a good meal.

771
00:41:27.397 --> 00:41:30.183
You also think
it's gonna happen again.

772
00:41:30.183 --> 00:41:32.272
Why did you sign that memo?

773
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:34.317
You can't fight every battle.

774
00:41:34.317 --> 00:41:36.145
Have to choose
the ones you can win.

775
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.931
Yeah. but when you sign.
you're a part of the game.

776
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.803
And when you don't.
they replace you.

777
00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:43.544
The only decision you're making

778
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:46.199
is whether
to be buried or burned.

779
00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:57.558
Jesse Capleton can't fire you.

780
00:41:57.558 --> 00:41:59.778
He's not your boss.

781
00:41:59.778 --> 00:42:02.128
Jesse Capleton
operates my boss.

782
00:42:02.128 --> 00:42:04.565
who operates him in return.

783
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:08.874
Guys like that.
it's a circle jerk.

784
00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:11.441
All it takes is one call.

785
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:14.009
"Don't you think Lammark's
a little off his game?"

786
00:42:14.009 --> 00:42:16.751
"Well. there is
no bigger fan than me.

787
00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:20.276
but we do have to think
of his heart."

788
00:42:20.276 --> 00:42:23.323
They each say what
the other one wants to hear.

789
00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:24.933
Before you know it.

790
00:42:24.933 --> 00:42:27.370
you're packing your desk
into a box.

791
00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:31.244
- Humble opinion?
- Mm-hmm?

792
00:42:31.244 --> 00:42:34.813
It's not 'cause they're scared
you won't catch him.

793
00:42:34.813 --> 00:42:36.945
It's 'cause
they're scared you will.

794
00:42:36.945 --> 00:42:39.034
You crack this.
you get the spotlight.

795
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.819
Some people just can't stand
the shadows.

796
00:42:45.998 --> 00:42:48.087
There's something odd
about Lang.

797
00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:53.353
The watch. the shoes.

798
00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:54.789
bringing the baby in.

799
00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:57.009
It's not Lang.
His alibi's solid.

800
00:42:57.009 --> 00:42:58.924
But I'll call Tracey
in the morning

801
00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:01.013
if you want to monitor
his comm.

802
00:43:04.669 --> 00:43:06.584
How long have you been married?

803
00:43:08.368 --> 00:43:10.457
Ever since we were allowed.

804
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:18.508
That's the big question:

805
00:43:18.508 --> 00:43:21.555
how people shape systems.
how systems shape us.

806
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.253
Can I get you a little...

807
00:43:24.253 --> 00:43:26.255
- Oh. just water. thank you.

808
00:43:26.255 --> 00:43:28.083
Today. it's all about status.

809
00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:30.825
The people that have it
would kill to protect it.

810
00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:33.959
the people that want it
would kill to achieve it.

811
00:43:33.959 --> 00:43:36.352
and everybody else
gets crushed in between.

812
00:43:36.352 --> 00:43:40.661
Governments. corporations
and high schools.

813
00:43:40.661 --> 00:43:42.097
Pattern seems to be the same.

814
00:43:42.097 --> 00:43:43.446
How do we change that?

815
00:43:43.446 --> 00:43:46.536
You mean empathy. connection?

816
00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:48.974
If we truly see ourselves
in others.

817
00:43:48.974 --> 00:43:51.063
we want to raise them up.
not bring them down.

818
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.891
If we ever run out of money.

819
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:55.371
you are gonna write
fridge magnets.

820
00:43:56.982 --> 00:44:00.028
I'm serious--
you would be fantastic.

821
00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:03.858
Oh.

822
00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:08.080
What are they saying?

823
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.169
You don't want to know.

824
00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:13.738
Gavin. I do want to know.

825
00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:15.827
That's why I asked.

826
00:44:15.827 --> 00:44:17.437
You know the drill.

827
00:44:17.437 --> 00:44:19.439
First 24 hours is:
"Who did this?"

828
00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:22.094
And then after that. it's:

829
00:44:22.094 --> 00:44:24.662
"Who's the idiot
that's not catching him?"

830
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.055
No. I meant the theory.

831
00:44:27.055 --> 00:44:29.710
- Oh. Right.
- What's the theory?

832
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.538
- Mm-hmm.
- Sleeper cells of terrorists

833
00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:33.583
in every American town.

834
00:44:33.583 --> 00:44:36.412
an inside job designed to scrap
civil liberties laws.

835
00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:37.936
Jewish plot? Take your pick.

836
00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:39.241
And what's yours?

837
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:40.416
Such a good question.

838
00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:41.591
- Let me see.
- Bad call.

839
00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:43.898
She asked.

840
00:44:43.898 --> 00:44:46.945
I think your man
wasn't born here.

841
00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:48.816
Hmm.

842
00:44:48.816 --> 00:44:52.515
I think he feels
a place he grew up in

843
00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:54.561
has become
a pretty awful place.

844
00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:57.346
along with a good portion
of the world... -Mm.

845
00:44:57.346 --> 00:45:01.220
...and I think he believes
this nation is responsible

846
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.136
for at least 50% of that mess.

847
00:45:04.136 --> 00:45:05.572
Shit.

848
00:45:05.572 --> 00:45:07.400
If you weren't afraid
of heights.

849
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.010
I'd book you as a suspect.

850
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.057
What scares me is that
a good portion of you

851
00:45:12.057 --> 00:45:14.581
- thinks this man has a point.
Mm-hmm.

852
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:16.757
About the country
that stopped the Nazis...

853
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.890
- Mm. Right.
- ...stepped on the moon.

854
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:20.935
mapped the entire human genome

855
00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:23.372
and landed a spacecraft on Mars

856
00:45:23.372 --> 00:45:26.854
140 million miles
from your current position.

857
00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:32.033
While landing our brands.
our plastic. our distortion.

858
00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:34.732
our exaggeration
everywhere else.

859
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.908
I went to Bogotá to lecture.

860
00:45:36.908 --> 00:45:38.474
Best damn coffee
on Earth. right?

861
00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:39.780
You know where they took me?

862
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.087
Starbucks.

863
00:45:42.087 --> 00:45:43.697
We take the best of everywhere.

864
00:45:43.697 --> 00:45:45.568
and we send it back worse
for profit.

865
00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:47.396
And that's what we do
to our friends.

866
00:45:47.396 --> 00:45:49.007
Profits pay taxes.

867
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:50.748
which pays for
research and development.

868
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.751
- Eleanor...
- Gavin. go to bed.

869
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:56.362
or I'll arrest you for
harassing two public servants.

870
00:45:56.362 --> 00:45:57.798
- I give up. I give up.

871
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:08.548
So. Eleanor.
why did you lie to me?

872
00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:10.289
Sir?

873
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:13.335
You were rejected
by the Bureau.

874
00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:15.076
You decided not to tell me?

875
00:46:15.076 --> 00:46:17.992
That's what pissed me off.
not the lab report.

876
00:46:17.992 --> 00:46:19.602
Yeah. it was eight years ago.

877
00:46:19.602 --> 00:46:21.430
I didn't think it would matter.

878
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.173
We're under the microscope.

879
00:46:26.348 --> 00:46:28.220
Everything matters.

880
00:46:31.658 --> 00:46:33.399
I just thought
I could prove myself

881
00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:35.227
before I got found out.

882
00:46:37.403 --> 00:46:39.187
I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

883
00:46:39.187 --> 00:46:41.624
You aced observation
and knowledge.

884
00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:44.149
It was your psych eval
that did you in.

885
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:47.587
"Aggressive. addictive.
antisocial."

886
00:46:47.587 --> 00:46:49.894
This is the profile
of people we arrest. not hire.

887
00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:54.768
You know when they ask you
to draw a tree? -Mm-hmm.

888
00:46:54.768 --> 00:46:57.336
The trunk represents
your life up to the present.

889
00:46:57.336 --> 00:46:59.251
- Yeah.
- And from the picture.

890
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.689
Dr. Katz conjectured
that something fucked you up.

891
00:47:02.689 --> 00:47:05.866
and pretty badly.
around the age of 12.

892
00:47:05.866 --> 00:47:07.563
There's no soil.

893
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:09.609
Tree has no roots. no fruit.

894
00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:11.698
Did something happen back then?

895
00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:14.440
- Is this necessary?
- It's not mandatory.

896
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.269
I just want to know
if we should fire Dr. Katz.

897
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:20.925
'cause I think you got talent.

898
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:23.797
"Have you ever tried
any illegal substances?"

899
00:47:23.797 --> 00:47:26.147
"Yes." "Which ones?"
"All of them."

900
00:47:26.147 --> 00:47:28.323
That didn't help
your application. either.

901
00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:29.847
What were you thinking?

902
00:47:30.891 --> 00:47:34.155
Kurt Cobain: "I'd rather
be hated for who I am

903
00:47:34.155 --> 00:47:35.983
than loved for who I'm not."

904
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.898
Yeah.

905
00:47:37.898 --> 00:47:40.770
He's not exactly a role model.
according to the Bureau.

906
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.121
You worked at a dry cleaner's
and with a call center.

907
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:45.384
Hey. why didn't you look for
something with more prospects?

908
00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:46.907
You're smart. articulate.

909
00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:48.387
Well. that doesn't
count for much

910
00:47:48.387 --> 00:47:49.910
when you don't go to college.

911
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.912
So. why didn't you?

912
00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:54.393
Because there was no one
to pay for it.

913
00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:56.438
And when you work all day
trying to make rent.

914
00:47:56.438 --> 00:47:59.354
you don't feel like studying;
you feel like sleeping.

915
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:01.791
What led you
to law enforcement?

916
00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:04.359
I was looking for protection.

917
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:06.274
From who?

918
00:48:08.798 --> 00:48:11.018
From myself.

919
00:48:11.018 --> 00:48:12.759
That enough for you?

920
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:14.500
No.

921
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.023
Eleanor...

922
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.290
...the only thing enough for me
is a solid lead.

923
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.337
The hatred
that drives our shooter

924
00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:27.948
isn't so different from yours.

925
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:31.169
Instead of going out there
and wiping everybody out.

926
00:48:31.169 --> 00:48:33.432
you turn it against yourself.

927
00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:37.044
I need you to use it as fuel
to bring me something new.

928
00:48:37.044 --> 00:48:39.351
Now.

929
00:48:39.351 --> 00:48:43.050
We get this guy.
this all goes away.

930
00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.836
And we can both do the job
we were meant to.

931
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:24.222
Would you like your teeth
whitened. ma'am?

932
00:49:24.222 --> 00:49:25.963
We can do it
right here on the spot.

933
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:27.747
Not today.
- You'll notice the difference

934
00:49:27.747 --> 00:49:29.488
- in just five minutes.
- Thank you. dear.

935
00:49:29.488 --> 00:49:31.316
Brighten your sm...

936
00:49:55.557 --> 00:49:58.343
WOMAN [over P.A.]: Ladies.
if you're longing for summer.

937
00:49:58.343 --> 00:50:00.475
it's time to start
getting in shape.

938
00:50:00.475 --> 00:50:04.001
Come for a free consultation
in the second-floor beauty bar.

939
00:50:06.568 --> 00:50:08.135
MAN [over P.A.]:
Please do not leave

940
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:10.094
any store bags unattended.

941
00:50:10.094 --> 00:50:12.705
If you see anything suspicious.
just tell our security team.

942
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.533
Uh. excuse me.
- Yes?

943
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:17.144
Uh. I think you took my stuff
by mistake.

944
00:50:17.144 --> 00:50:18.667
My own clothes.

945
00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:32.420
What the hell is wrong
with you. bro?

946
00:50:44.737 --> 00:50:47.174
Uh. excuse me.

947
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:48.828
You got a guy giving himself

948
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:50.699
a full body wash
in the basin back there.

949
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:52.832
Uh-huh. -I mean.
I'm guessing he's got issues.

950
00:50:52.832 --> 00:50:55.052
- but seriously. not cool.
- Yeah. I got it.

951
00:50:56.618 --> 00:50:58.794
MAN [over radio]: Can we get
someone down to level three?

952
00:50:58.794 --> 00:51:00.361
I-I got a guy here.

953
00:51:00.361 --> 00:51:02.581
Uh. somebody ran off
with his clothes.

954
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:15.550
Let's call dispatch.
There's no one here.

955
00:51:24.385 --> 00:51:27.301
Oh. my God. What's he doing?

956
00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:29.129
- I'm tired of these dudes.
- Hey.

957
00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:31.044
Where's your sense
of self-respect?

958
00:51:31.044 --> 00:51:32.654
You're not an animal.

959
00:51:32.654 --> 00:51:34.526
- Ignore him. It's...
- I...

960
00:51:34.526 --> 00:51:36.484
Hey!

961
00:51:36.484 --> 00:51:37.746
Sir!

962
00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:42.403
Sir. stop right there.

963
00:51:42.403 --> 00:51:44.536
Hold it!

964
00:51:44.536 --> 00:51:47.278
Gonna need to take a look
in the bag. sir.

965
00:51:47.278 --> 00:51:49.106
Don't make us ask twice.

966
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:50.890
Just open the bag. sir.

967
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.761
- I just want to go home.
- I know you want to go home.

968
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.372
We just need to see
the contents of the bag.

969
00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:56.243
Please. can you open
that up for us?

970
00:51:56.243 --> 00:51:57.766
- I just want to go.
- We'll let you go.

971
00:51:57.766 --> 00:51:59.159
We just need you
to open that bag.

972
00:51:59.159 --> 00:52:01.161
Open the bag right now. please.

973
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.728
Open the bag.
- Sir. don't make me ask again.

974
00:52:02.728 --> 00:52:04.208
- Open the bag.
Open the bag!

975
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:05.470
Fuck!

976
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.217
I haven't seen
an XM21 in years.

977
00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:15.175
but they're around
if you know where to look.

978
00:52:15.175 --> 00:52:16.611
Where would I look?

979
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:18.874
DoD's the only
government department

980
00:52:18.874 --> 00:52:21.790
that's failed every audit
for the last 25 years.

981
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.967
They lost track of a billion
dollars' worth of weapons

982
00:52:24.967 --> 00:52:26.795
in Iraq and Kuwait alone.

983
00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:29.015
Mr. Lassky. why would you buy
a vintage weapon

984
00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:30.582
when there are
newer ones available?

985
00:52:30.582 --> 00:52:33.280
Well. ofttimes. they're better.

986
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.849
Easy load. easy clean.
standard ammo.

987
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:38.894
Like that 1853 Enfield?

988
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:40.940
Yeah.

989
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.202
That's a classic.

990
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:44.378
Used by the Confederate forces.

991
00:52:44.378 --> 00:52:46.467
And the Ku Klux Klan.

992
00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:52.169
Listen. I'm not doing
anything illegal here.

993
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:53.909
The history of America...

994
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:56.782
Milkor BXP? In Maryland?

995
00:52:56.782 --> 00:52:58.392
It's pretty illegal.

996
00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:01.613
Look. Mr. Lassky.
I'm gonna need

997
00:53:01.613 --> 00:53:03.136
a list of all of your clients.

998
00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:04.659
If this guy's one of them

999
00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:06.139
and you withheld
that information...

1000
00:53:18.107 --> 00:53:19.805
MAN [over radio]:
Got two paramedic teams here.

1001

Copy that.

1002
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:29.641
We'll send an escort.
Which entryway. please?

1003
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:32.078
Copy that. Okay. keep moving.

1004

1006
00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:10.247
Are they even listening?

1007
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:12.771
Guy's over six feet.
white as my ass.

1008
00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:15.252
Yeah. I'll go set 'em straight.

1009
00:54:18.603 --> 00:54:20.648
- OFFICER [over radio]:
- I repeat. .

1010
00:54:20.648 --> 00:54:22.520
35. five-ten. 220 pounds...

1011
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.173
Okay.

1012
00:54:24.173 --> 00:54:26.915
...Magnum .357
in the back of his trunk.

1013
00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:52.027
That's got to be the weirdest
fucking thing I've ever seen.

1014
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:53.681
Talk to Sam.

1015
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:56.205
Reflections in windows.
cameras in stores.

1016
00:54:56.205 --> 00:54:59.426
We should be able to get
a 3D printout of this guy.

1017
00:55:06.477 --> 00:55:08.566
Sorry. there's no...
there's no cameras in there.

1018
00:55:08.566 --> 00:55:10.742
Not yet.

1019
00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:13.745
W-W-Wait. Rewind that.

1020
00:55:18.184 --> 00:55:20.142
- That's his shirt.

1021
00:55:20.142 --> 00:55:23.102
- Take me to that restroom.
- Yeah. sure.

1022
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:38.639
He didn't come here to kill.

1023
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.860
He came here to eat.

1024
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.818
To get new clothes.

1025
00:55:45.254 --> 00:55:47.213
To clean up.

1026
00:55:47.213 --> 00:55:50.347
A dog who knows
where the leftovers are.

1027
00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:52.653
Smart enough
not to leave any fingerprints.

1028
00:55:55.917 --> 00:55:58.833
Is he just picking out
the vegetables? -Yeah.

1029
00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:00.792
There's your iron deficiency.

1030
00:56:00.792 --> 00:56:03.229
Our dog is a herbivore.

1031
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:16.416
Christ.

1032
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:18.549
The marksmanship.

1033
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:24.598
Cool as a fucking cucumber.

1034
00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:33.041
He doesn't want to engage.

1035
00:56:39.047 --> 00:56:40.962
This is like fucking "Pac-Man."

1036
00:56:45.837 --> 00:56:47.578
Who trained him?

1037
00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:50.581
Not the Army.

1038
00:56:50.581 --> 00:56:54.933
Weapons are an extensionof hims.

1039
00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:57.370
He was born among 'em.

1040
00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:28.793
McKENZIE [over radio]:
Bad news here.

1041
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:32.405
What is it?
The cleaning crew

1042
00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:34.015
came through
before the shooting began.

1043
00:57:34.015 --> 00:57:35.843
The trucks pick up at 2:00.

1044
00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:38.019
Oh. my God.
- Where do they go?

1045
00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:43.372
Ugh.

1046
00:57:43.372 --> 00:57:45.374
I can't tell what's gonna
happen to me first--

1047
00:57:45.374 --> 00:57:47.028
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1048
00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:48.900
- or I'm gonna get fired.
Yeah.

1049
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.379
Well. thanks
for the reassurance.

1050
00:57:50.379 --> 00:57:51.946
You're just being paranoid.

1051
00:57:55.167 --> 00:57:57.212
Look. in case I'm not.

1052
00:57:57.212 --> 00:57:59.127
work side by side
with McKenzie.

1053
00:57:59.127 --> 00:58:01.695
Stop that truck.
If we can get that DNA...

1054
00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:04.611
- Mac. where are you?

1055
00:58:04.611 --> 00:58:06.700
- Take her with you.
Yeah.

1056
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.920
I'm just letting him
think he's in charge.

1057
00:58:23.804 --> 00:58:25.719
Hey. Lammark.

1058
00:58:28.461 --> 00:58:30.898
Take your pills.
Ignore the clowns.

1059
00:58:30.898 --> 00:58:32.987
Fight the jackals.

1060
00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:35.860
Get out of here.

1061
00:58:57.055 --> 00:58:59.927
Whole building
takes a shit four times a day.

1062
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:02.713
Everything gets mixed together.
compressed in the trucks

1063
00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:04.628
and then dropped here.

1064
00:59:06.934 --> 00:59:08.327
Thank you.

1065
00:59:08.327 --> 00:59:09.676
Thank you. gentlemen.

1066
00:59:09.676 --> 00:59:10.808
Thanks.

1067
00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:12.723
We're looking for a green shirt

1068
00:59:12.723 --> 00:59:13.985
someone dropped
in the second-floor restroom.

1069
00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:15.943
- Any tips?
- Yeah.

1070
00:59:15.943 --> 00:59:17.902
Don't eat the sushi.

1071
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.906
Isn't the. uh. organic stuff

1072
00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:23.821
supposed to get separated
from recycling?

1073
00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:26.040
Yeah. but we don't do that yet.

1074
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.434
I guess they're still telling
people to separate their trash

1075
00:59:28.434 --> 00:59:30.088
to raise awareness
or something.

1076
00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:32.220
- Who knows?
- Right.

1077
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.006
- Thanks. man.
- Yeah. don't mention it.

1078
01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.708
One of the biggest
attacks in American history.

1079
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.710
and all we can offer is
"please stay indoors"?

1080
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.712
Nathan. it's been
less than 72 hours

1081
01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.409
since the first shooting.

1082
01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.063
And people already think
you lost control.

1083
01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.673
We need a game changer.

1084
01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:35.936
- This could be it.
- No. no. no.

1085
01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:38.417
We still don't have a face.

1086
01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:39.723
Let's show the way he moves.

1087
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.289
Two and a half million viewers.

1088
01:00:41.289 --> 01:00:43.248
Someone's got to know this guy.

1089
01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:45.424
Kittridge is an idiot.
Idiots are unpredictable.

1090
01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:47.252
It's Pandora's fucking box.

1091
01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:50.777
We risk unleashing problems
we don't even have.

1092
01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:52.387
I'd rather take a fucking risk

1093
01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:53.867
than have people think
we have nothing.

1094
01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.129
I mean the risk
to the population.

1095
01:00:55.129 --> 01:00:56.957
not your administration.

1096
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.924
That's a lead.

1097
01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:08.360
Hair. sweat.

1098
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.275
What about prints?

1099
01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:13.713
On most fabrics. it's unlikely.
but let my team do their job.

1100
01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:16.368
Look. I don't think
you're listening. Lammark.

1101
01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.065
The decision's
out of your hands.

1102
01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:20.241
You don't play along.
so is this investigation.

1103
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.939
This doesn't look very good.

1104
01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.419
- No. it doesn't. At all.
- KITTRIDGE [on TV]: Beware.

1105
01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.683
The exclusive footage
you are about to see

1106
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.816
contains extremely
disturbing images.

1107
01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:32.732
If you're with kids
or sensitive to violence.

1108
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:35.648
then please look away now.

1109
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.782
These acts are horrifying.

1110
01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.740
but they're not
the product of a monster.

1111
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.873
They're the product of a man.

1112
01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:46.615
A dangerous man. sure.
but damaged. too.

1113
01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:50.924
That's why I make this plea.

1114
01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:55.973
If you know this man.
if you love this man.

1115
01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:59.237
if you are this man.
then call this number.

1116
01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.847
Well...
- We're here to help.

1117
01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.241
...there's the Nobel
for the worst fucking idea.

1118
01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:08.028
Teamwork makes the dream work.

1119
01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.509
Oh. fuck off. Frank.

1120
01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:12.816
Now. with me tonight
is Martha Curry. professor...

1121
01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:14.948
HDM. World War II era.

1122
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:17.516
OSS pistol of choice.

1123
01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:19.736
Hard to find outside
Special Forces inventories.

1124
01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.650
CURRY [on TV]: When it comes
to mental disorders.

1125
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.478
violence is
more commonly reactive

1126
01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:25.002
than planned. triggered by...

1127
01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:26.438
Okay. I got to stop you there.

1128
01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:28.309
We have a caller. Hello.

1129
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.703
WOMAN [on TV]:
I'm scared of my husband.

1130
01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:32.531
He's been acting weird lately.
He's...

1131
01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:34.272
Does this man
look like your husband?

1132
01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:35.882
Could this be him?

1133
01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.797
Actually not. but still...

1134
01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:40.278
Okay. okay. I'm sorry.
This isn't marriage guidance.

1135
01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:43.803
We are here to identify
a mass murderer.

1136
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.937
All right. Arsenal keepers
from the last 50 years.

1137
01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:49.678
Green means solid alibi.
blue still TBC.

1138
01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:51.376
We're targeting
the ones in pink.

1139
01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.857
They've been discharged
from the Forces.

1140
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.467
And the yellow?

1141
01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.904
Oh. they're dead.
Pretty solid alibi.

1142
01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:00.733
Yeah. I think
we can safely assume

1143
01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:03.823
that the shooter
is amongst the living.

1144
01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:07.174
Munitions this old could be
quite the inheritance. sir.

1145
01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:09.611
That's a damn good point.

1146
01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:13.485
Damn good point.

1147
01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:22.581
Okay. Mall footprint analysis.

1148
01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.452
Cat work boots. six years old.

1149
01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.150
He's not the first owner.

1150
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.500
Soles worn on the left.
He favors the right.

1151
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.330
Also sawdust. wood chips
and paint traces.

1152
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.767
MAN [on TV]: I know who killed
a thousand people last year.

1153
01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.769
- The police did.
Sir. 24 officers

1154
01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.815
just died in that mall.

1155
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.426
The police risk their lives
to protect you.

1156
01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:43.776
...Daunte Wright.
Andre Hill. Breonna Taylor.

1157
01:03:43.776 --> 01:03:45.778
Should I go on?

1158
01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:48.085
We are looking to
make television history here.

1159
01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.521
This number is exclusively...

1160
01:03:58.008 --> 01:04:00.575
"Thou shalt not kill."

1161
01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.751
I saw that in a school room.

1162
01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:07.365
When have you last seen
"Thou shalt not kill"?

1163
01:04:07.365 --> 01:04:09.323
When have you last seen that?

1164
01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:12.892
My goal here today is to try
to calm things down.

1165
01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.894
not make things worse.

1166
01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:30.040
- MAN [on TV]:
- Because-because... ]

1167
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.693
Try to have a dialogue.

1168
01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:33.086
Sir. you came up
with a dumb statement...

1169
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.350
...that came from
your prejudiced heart.

1170
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.091
Sweden was founded by Vikings.

1171
01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:39.788
Shirt results just in.

1172
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.747
Mm-hmm?
- All right.

1173
01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:43.531
No fingerprints. but CODIS
found hair and skin particles.

1174
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.272
Hair's brittle near the ends.

1175
01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:47.753
and when it falls out.
so do fragments of the skin.

1176
01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:50.103
What are they trying to do?
Sell me dandruff shampoo?

1177
01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:52.149
No. it's common among people

1178
01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:53.933
who suffered
severe head trauma.

1179
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.761
The majority
of the last shootings

1180
01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.894
have all been involved
with these kids.

1181
01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:06.293
And you are live on
"The Kittridge Show."

1182
01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.947
Don't be shy.

1183
01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:11.255
I'm not shy. I'm proud.

1184
01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.910
Proud? Of what?

1185
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.476
Proud of my people.

1186
01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:17.174
Proud of our soldier.

1187
01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:18.610
Oh. you're an army?

1188
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.133
Are you commanding these guys?

1189
01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:21.787
What do you want.
cheaper sneakers?

1190
01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.397
They're on it.
They're tracking him down.

1191
01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:24.398
'Cause not many great battles

1192
01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:25.922
were fought in a mall.

1193
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.575
This isn't a game.

1194
01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:29.273
It's a reset.

1195
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:30.709
- Our nation's promise restored.

1196
01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.406
He used a prepaid AT line

1197
01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:34.060
and dialed star 67
to hide his number.

1198
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.844
Okay.
- That works?

1199
01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.411
How do I know you're not

1200
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.152
just some kid
with a voice distortion app.

1201
01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:42.155
jerking off on
a swastika flag? -

1202
01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.984
An HDM? An Ingram MAC-10?

1203
01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:46.594
Those are not kids' toys.

1204
01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.553
You can mock me
from your ivory castle.

1205
01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:50.207
but your time is coming.
too. my friend.

1206
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.338
Whoa.

1207
01:05:51.338 --> 01:05:52.905
Phone was bought at Walmart

1208
01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:54.385
in Montgomery County
25 minutes ago.

1209
01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:55.908
I'm shaking in my shoes.

1210
01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:56.909
You know. I hope
you're dumb enough

1211
01:05:56.909 --> 01:05:58.128
to come after me.

1212
01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.781
I think you'll find my castle

1213
01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.566
- is pretty well secured.

1214
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:02.915
Your
daughter's college room isn't.

1215
01:06:02.915 --> 01:06:04.743
Paid in cash.
no credit card info.

1216
01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:06.179
300 million Americans.

1217
01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:08.138
400 million guns.

1218
01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:10.792
And I'm sure someone out there
would love to lend a hand.

1219
01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.229
That's enough
to get you in jail.

1220
01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.013
Worst fucking idea. indeed.

1221
01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.710
You know
they'll find you. right?

1222
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.190
Only a matter of time.

1223
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.887
Not sure about that.

1224
01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:21.020
Half the crimes in this country
never get solved.

1225
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.456
- Your tax dollars go

1226
01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:23.892
to defense contractors--

1227
01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:25.459
- drones. missiles. nukes...
- What?

1228
01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.983
What?

1229
01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.854
...but those can't
protect you from us.

1230
01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.812
So you don't like our?

1231
01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:32.989
My sister's pregnant.

1232
01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.816
- Jesus. Mac.
- I'm-I'm sorry. everybody.

1233
01:06:34.816 --> 01:06:36.862
The real enemy lies within.

1234
01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:38.690
Taking our jobs.
taking our land.

1235
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.474
taking our women.

1236
01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:43.303
While they're overseaswiping ou.

1237
01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.653
we can handle
all the Blacks and yellows

1238
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.004
and the nigger-loving.
money-hungry Jews as well.

1239
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.353
- Fucking sick.
- If our so-called leaders

1240
01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:50.963
won't speak up for us.

1241
01:06:50.963 --> 01:06:52.573
- our rifles will.

1242
01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:54.227
They've located the register.

1243
01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:55.663
and they're patching through
the security feed.

1244
01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:57.535
Okay. look. if you ace

1245
01:06:57.535 --> 01:06:59.058
behind these attacks.
I'm gonna speak on behalf

1246
01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:01.104
of the families
you've destroyed.

1247
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.670
You're a coward.

1248
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.585
You're a hack.
an attention seeker.

1249
01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.196
The invisible
army is ready to fight.

1250
01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:08.111
Don't kill yourselves. boys.

1251
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.330
Your pain's not a weakness.

1252
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.897
It's a weapon.

1253
01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.638
- Time to use it.

1254
01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:14.987
Hello?

1255
01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.597
Okay. they got him.

1256
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.562
The call began
at 8:21 in Somerset.

1257
01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:27.304
ended at 8:29
five miles southwest.

1258
01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:29.132
A minute later.
the chip went dead.

1259
01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.830
but the phone's GPS matches
that of a Chevy Silverado.

1260
01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:34.485
license plate
Alpha. Lima. Xray.

1261
01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.182
eight. zero. eight.

1262
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.315
Registered to
a David Lee Hicks.

1263
01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:41.666
He's an NRA member
and a legal owner of an AR-15.

1264
01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:44.234
an AK-47
and a bunch of hunting rifles.

1265
01:07:44.234 --> 01:07:47.019
He's also a member of the local
branch of Three Percenters.

1266
01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.934
He hates government.
liberals and Jews.

1267
01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:50.675
COMMANDER [over radio]:
This is Somerset commander.

1268
01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.633
We got a comms van
and tactical gear

1269
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:54.244
ready for you on the tarmac.

1270
01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.115
Please advise ETA.

1271
01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:03.253
What is it. Eleanor?

1272
01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:05.646
The NRA? The Three Percent?

1273
01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.648
Our guy's a loner.
not a joiner.

1274
01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:09.172
Okay.

1275
01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:10.869
Your objection is duly noted.

1276
01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.654
A man on a mission
does not stop for falafel.

1277
01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.482
This is not our killer.
This isn't our case.

1278
01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:16.918
Let someone else
take care of it.

1279
01:08:16.918 --> 01:08:19.486
I can't. I'm following orders.

1280
01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:22.010
Even when you know
they're wrong?

1281
01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:29.409
Power is disputed
between people who deserve it

1282
01:08:29.409 --> 01:08:31.237
and people who adore it.

1283
01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:32.934
It's a perpetual fight.

1284
01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:35.111
I can't say we're winning.

1285
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.896
Right now.
we got to stay in the ring.

1286
01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:40.203
Sir. with all due respect...

1287
01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:43.206
Oh. goddamn it. Eleanor!
You're following orders. too!

1288
01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:51.039
COMMANDER [over radio]:
They're heading down

1289
01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:52.476
Wisconsin Avenue. car 17.

1290
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:53.825
Intercept
at Friendship Heights.

1291
01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:55.261
Copy that.

1292
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:34.866
Jesus. it's fucking cold.

1293
01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.093
Okay.

1294
01:09:45.093 --> 01:09:47.270
O.K. Corral.

1295
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.540
You owned that moron. man.

1296
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.238
Shit's going down after this.

1297
01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:09.292
Guys. now he's thanking the
cops for protecting his kid.

1298
01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:14.253
These fucking guys--
never risk anything.

1299
01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:17.648
and they think the world
spins around them.

1300
01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.568
Right. 'cause when
you're on TV.

1301
01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.265
all the pigs come running.

1302
01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.789
But who the fuck's
protecting our kids? Huh?

1303
01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.575
Who the fuck's
protecting our kids?

1304
01:10:31.575 --> 01:10:33.794
We're protecting our kids.
you moron.

1305
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.971
Well. I'm starving.

1306
01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.111
Whole police force
shielding a dorm room

1307
01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:49.245
while bodies pile up
in the streets.

1308
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.552
He doesn't know
what's coming to him.

1309
01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:55.294
"Invisible army" is trending.

1310
01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:56.904
This is a game changer. guys.

1311
01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:58.993
Something has to happen.

1312
01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:05.826
Okay. so shampoo?

1313
01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.089
Yes. and some Whitestrips.

1314
01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:10.396
-  Yeah.
- Please.

1315
01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.485
- Okay.
- Oh. candy!

1316
01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:20.580
- I know who's paying.

1317
01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.107
Fucking light beer. light b.

1318
01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.240
light beer. light beer.

1319
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.417
Who owns this place.
the Mormons?

1320
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.419
Shh.

1321
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.160
I'll take that for you.

1322
01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:44.430
Let's go to a fucking bar.

1323
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.476
Ah. you'll get drunk
and start showing off.

1324
01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.173
I prefer to stay out
of trouble.

1325
01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:50.001
I'll meet you in the car?

1326
01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.656
Um. did you get
the pills for your dad?

1327
01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.442
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

1328
01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:04.058
Sir?

1329
01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:05.712
Hi.

1330
01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:09.020
- What's that?
- Um. it's... Can you...

1331
01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.370
Not your night. huh?

1332
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.590
Sir. can you come with me. please?

1333
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.070
Speak up. girl.
I can't hear you.

1334
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.681
Just-just come
with me this way. sir.

1335
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.118
I-Is this a survey?-No. no. no.

1336
01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.902
Um. I just... We...

1337
01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:23.556
Can you... Can you come with me
really quickly. please?

1338
01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.210
Well. I'm in a rush.

1339
01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.777
I have to go home.
My-my wife...

1340
01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.561
Yeah. that's-that's all...
That's okay.

1341
01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:30.476
That's okay. -M-My wife
is sick. and I'm in a rush.

1342
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:32.304
Yeah. I-I just
need you to come with me.

1343
01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:34.611
I-I really can't. -Sir. I need .

1344
01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:36.743
I really don't have that much
time. -Sir. come with me now!

1345
01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:39.006
My wife... my-my wife
is waiting for me. -Now!

1346
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:51.410
- FBI!
- Drop your weapon!

1347
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:52.759
Fuck you!

1348
01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:54.370
Drop it now!

1349
01:12:55.632 --> 01:12:57.111
Drop it!

1350
01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.384
- Falco!
- We're good!

1351
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.830
ELEANOR [panting]:
Oh. my God.

1352
01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.269
FBI!

1353
01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:25.531
Eyes on me!

1354
01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:29.666
Fuck.

1355
01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.929
- Fuck!
- I need you to drop the weapon

1356
01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:33.757
and show me those hands.

1357
01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:35.672
- You fucking nigger!
- I don't need that.

1358
01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:38.109
I need you to drop the weapon
and get those hands up.

1359
01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:40.328
Get the fuck out of here!

1360
01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:41.678
Get the fuck out of this place!

1361
01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.462
Drop your weapon
and show me your hands.

1362
01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:45.595
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out.

1363
01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:48.424
David. drop the weapon
and get those hands up!

1364
01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.295
- No nigger's gonna...

1365
01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.050
For the last time.
just fuck off.

1366
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.139
Hey. don't fucking
talk to me like that.

1367
01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:09.836
I need to know what you did.

1368
01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:11.751
I need to know who's involved.
and I need to know...

1369
01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.188
He's basically saying
it's a prank gone wrong.

1370
01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:16.843
Tracey confirmed it.

1371
01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:19.672
The army's not invisible.
It just doesn't exist at all.

1372
01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.935
There's no organization.
no communications.

1373
01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:23.459
You fucking tell us something...

1374
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.025
Just some copy-and-paste

1375
01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:26.505
conspiracy bullshit
on a Facebook page

1376
01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:27.898
with 23 likes.

1377
01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:29.377
And that call to Kittridge

1378
01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:31.423
caused serious
collateral damage.

1379
01:14:33.338 --> 01:14:35.340
Mr. Lammark.
did you give the order

1380
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.343
to share the mall footage
with "The Kittridge Show"?

1381
01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.911
It was not my strategy.

1382
01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:44.871
I advised that the plan
was risky and flawed.

1383
01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.438
But this was
your investigation?

1384
01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:49.267
- You had overall control?
-  Yes.

1385
01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.095
Was it also under your command
that the public

1386
01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:53.924
were encouraged to call inwitho?

1387
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.016
Yes. ma'am.

1388
01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:01.018
Just a half hour
after the show ended.

1389
01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.542
two teenagers shot
two people dead

1390
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.936
and wounded three more
before taking their own lives.

1391
01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:08.242
In Boston.
a Molotov cocktail was thrown

1392
01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.070
through the window
of Temple Israel.

1393
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.682
causing the janitor
life-changing injuries.

1394
01:15:12.682 --> 01:15:14.901
Do you accept responsibility
for these crimes?

1395
01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:16.990
We all know
what's going on here.

1396
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.863
This is not about
the deaths of young men.

1397
01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:21.560
This is about the ambitions
of old ones.

1398
01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.519
Do you know the name
of the killer?

1399
01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.433
I know he's someone who's lived
off the grid for obviously...

1400
01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.305
Mr. Lammark.
please answer the question.

1401
01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:30.047
Do you know his profession?
His place of residence?

1402
01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:31.614
Not yet.

1403
01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.180
It seems that.
under your command.

1404
01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.356
information is no cure
for ignorance.

1405
01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:37.620
Perhaps if you'd paid
more attention to people

1406
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.186
who were qualified to help.

1407
01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:41.449
This internal report
suggests that

1408
01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:44.017
you've been taking your lead
from a police officer

1409
01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:45.845
with no investigative experience.

1410
01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:47.455
rejected by the Bureau.

1411
01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:48.979
with a long and proven
record of addiction.

1412
01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:51.198
Am I right?

1413
01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:53.287
Well. that's not what
I took from her application.

1414
01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:56.813
I saw a fiercely honest.
highly motivated person.

1415
01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:59.163
While everyone else
was helping residents

1416
01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.557
flee a burning building.
Officer Falco was the only one

1417
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.559
with the presence of mind
to film them doing it.

1418
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.952
Had our perpetrator been
amongst those exiting.

1419
01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:08.564
it would've been solely
down to her.

1420
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:11.305
I know talent when I see it.
It's a pivotal part of my job.

1421
01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.307
Perhaps. Mr. Lammark.
we should consider

1422
01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:15.135
whether your pursuit
of new talent

1423
01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:16.876
is because you know
your own is failing.

1424
01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:18.965
You've been
a fine public servant.

1425
01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:20.619
and you've fought your illness
with courage. but...

1426
01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:22.621
Okay. okay. okay.

1427
01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:26.843
I know this man.

1428
01:16:26.843 --> 01:16:29.672
I know how to find him.

1429
01:16:29.672 --> 01:16:31.674
You can fire me.

1430
01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:34.111
You get your sacrifice.

1431
01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:38.158
You keep me.
you will get your killer.

1432
01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.858
What do you want?

1433
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:57.090
♪ Black dogs
and black crows... ♪

1434
01:16:58.265 --> 01:16:59.963
It's everywhere.

1435
01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:02.530
What's it been. 45 minutes?

1436
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.272
They had
the press release ready.

1437
01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:07.710
"Lammarked man."

1438
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.537
"Lammark could piss
his own pants.

1439
01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:11.452
still not find out who did it."

1440
01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:13.672
-"Lammark..."
- Listen. don't read that mess.

1441
01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:17.197
Assholes are attracted to
comments like flies to shit.

1442
01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:18.851
Yeah.

1443
01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:28.948
Who?

1444
01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:31.037
What?

1445
01:17:31.037 --> 01:17:33.474
Come on.

1446
01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:36.086
- It's Morales.

1447
01:17:36.086 --> 01:17:37.870
I'm to report at 7:00 a.m..

1448
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:39.655
and he's requesting
your passwords.

1449
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.569
Morales.

1450
01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:43.180
He's good.

1451
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.664
We tried hard.

1452
01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:51.579
But we got nothing.

1453
01:17:51.579 --> 01:17:53.320
Sir. um...

1454
01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.757
Eleanor.

1455
01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:58.717
They used you as the rope.

1456
01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:00.893
- You're not the hangman.

1457
01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:05.637
All right.

1458
01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:06.943
Oh. shit.

1459
01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:09.119
- Time to go home.

1460
01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:12.165
Oh. Good to see you
taking it so well.

1461
01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:13.906
Come on.
Not in front of the kids.

1462
01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.081
Yeah.
Hmm?

1463
01:18:15.081 --> 01:18:16.604
I got to pay.

1464
01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:18.041
No. no. no. This is on them.

1465
01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.043
Thanks for the drinks. guys.

1466
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:25.309
- You got it?
- Yeah. yeah.

1467
01:18:25.309 --> 01:18:26.876
Okay.

1468
01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:28.878
30 years of service.
Un-fucking-believable.

1469
01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:41.325
♪ I watch her
walk away from me ♪

1470
01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:44.850
- ♪ Through the fields

1471
01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:48.288
♪ And the evening trees

1472
01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:52.075
♪ By the river
that runs to the sea... ♪

1473
01:20:57.809 --> 01:21:00.551
- I'm coming.

1474
01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:03.336
What the fuck is...

1475
01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:05.382
You know what
I couldn't wrap my head around

1476
01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:07.384
is how you could be
in two places at once.

1477
01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.473
And then it hit me.

1478
01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.214
You're outsourcing.

1479
01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:12.432
Give me that.

1480
01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:13.738
Hey. hey. be careful.

1481
01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:15.435
You painted the living room

1482
01:21:15.435 --> 01:21:16.915
with the guys from DeLuxe
on March 12th.

1483
01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:18.874
And then.
for the next two days.

1484
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.876
you gave the keys to someone
else to finish the bedrooms.

1485
01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.530
That's how you made time
for the Ultraviolet job

1486
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:25.663
on March 13th and March 14th.

1487
01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:26.969
So my question is:

1488
01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:28.405
Who the fuck
did you give them to?

1489
01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:30.407
What am I. a suspect here?

1490
01:21:30.407 --> 01:21:32.757
'Cause I think I need to call
my fucking lawyer right now.

1491
01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:35.020
No. you... -Just tell her
the fucking truth!

1492
01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:53.996
Sorry to wake you so early.

1493
01:21:53.996 --> 01:21:55.867
I just... I figured
you'd want a head start.

1494
01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:57.913
I started monitoring his comms.
and I made the connection.

1495
01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.392
Desmond. the baby.

1496
01:21:59.392 --> 01:22:01.220
was a distraction technique
all along.

1497
01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:06.747
Okay. I've been
gaming the system.

1498
01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:09.054
Taking more jobs than
I can handle.

1499
01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:12.797
Calling in other guys--
Armenians. Mexicans. Poles.

1500
01:22:12.797 --> 01:22:14.930
Very equal-opportunity of you.

1501
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.149
Well. everybody got
their fair cut.

1502
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.890
And with these
new regulations and shit.

1503
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:21.023
even they got expensive.

1504
01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:23.242
Till I found this list.

1505
01:22:23.242 --> 01:22:24.983
Ex-cons. guys with a record

1506
01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.680
- nobody would hire.

1507
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.247
Get the fuck out of here!

1508
01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:29.857
The dog! Come on!

1509
01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:31.859
Fucking dog.

1510
01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:34.950
These guys.
they work for next to nothing.

1511
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.777
as long as you don't ask 'em
too many questions.

1512
01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:38.997
And believe me. you don't want
to chat with these guys anyway.

1513
01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:41.478
I would always bring in lunch.
All right. that way. they could

1514
01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.132
- work through the day.
Mm-hmm.

1515
01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:46.439
And there's this one guy.
real particular.

1516
01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:48.615
No meat. no dairy.

1517
01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.574
Like some kind
of goddamn fucking monk.

1518
01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:53.359
So. one day. I ask him: "Why?"

1519
01:22:53.359 --> 01:22:57.320
He says he used to work
in a slaughterhouse downstate.

1520
01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.800
After that.
never could eat meat again.

1521
01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.717
I only knew him as Dean.

1522
01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.981
Tall guy. always wearing a cap.

1523
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.678
It's him.

1524
01:23:07.678 --> 01:23:10.028
He stopped answering.

1525
01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.769
I stopped calling.

1526
01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:14.076
Phone's a burner.
It's been dead for months.

1527
01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:16.078
There's only three
slaughterhouses downstate.

1528
01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.036
Look. I was scared.

1529
01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.820
I didn't want to get arrested.

1530
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.648
I was scared this guy
would come after me.

1531
01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:24.564
I got a fucking family.

1532
01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:36.272
He's out back.

1533
01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:48.344
Can I ask you guys
some questions? -Okay.

1534
01:24:48.344 --> 01:24:50.911
Um. does this man
look familiar to you?

1535
01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:09.060
Excuse me. Gentlemen.

1536
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.844
I'd just like a moment
of your time. please.

1537
01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.237
I'm with the FBI.

1538
01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:13.760
This guy is wanted
in connection

1539
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.153
with a multiple.
multiple homicide.

1540
01:25:15.153 --> 01:25:16.285
I'm wondering
if any of you guys

1541
01:25:16.285 --> 01:25:18.287
might have seen him before.

1542
01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:20.767
Take a look. He was here
probably a decade ago or more.

1543
01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.160
Maybe? No?

1544
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.422
Maybe works here still.

1545
01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:24.989
No.

1546
01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:27.905
But I didn't start here
till 2014.

1547
01:25:27.905 --> 01:25:30.429
You guys need to talk to...

1548
01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:35.391
Hey. Ramona!

1549
01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:38.307
Ramona. come over here.

1550
01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:45.140
This guy look familiar?

1551
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.881
Familiar?
That's Dean fucking Possey.

1552
01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:52.495
Kept his head down. No trouble.

1553
01:25:52.495 --> 01:25:54.323
Didn't like to socialize.

1554
01:25:54.323 --> 01:25:57.195
But Alonso.
the supervisor back then.

1555
01:25:57.195 --> 01:25:59.154
he was always teasing Dean.

1556
01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.677
Called him Quasimodo

1557
01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:02.461
'cause his head had
a creepy shape.

1558
01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:04.985
Nasty. stupid shit.

1559
01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:08.163
And then one night.
back around '98.

1560
01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:11.688
they share the last shift
on the hamburger sector.

1561
01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:14.386
We get in the next morning.
and Alonso's all ground up

1562
01:26:14.386 --> 01:26:17.215
at three eighths of an inch.

1563
01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:19.739
Dean said he trippedand fell in.

1564
01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:21.828
we all knew it was him.

1565
01:26:21.828 --> 01:26:23.265
He went to the can for it. actually.

1566
01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.354
but he was out after two years.

1567
01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:30.228
The case was
reopened in December '99.

1568
01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:32.230
He was paroled
with support letters

1569
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:35.102
from Colonel Leopold Stamper
and General Benjamin Tusk.

1570
01:26:35.102 --> 01:26:37.279
Both men served
with Possey's father.

1571
01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:39.019
Sergeant Arthur Jules Possey.

1572
01:26:39.019 --> 01:26:41.718
who was a shooting instructor
for the 75th Rangers.

1573
01:26:41.718 --> 01:26:43.763
When he stepped down
as instructor.

1574
01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:47.811
he remained the arsenal keeper
until he passed away in 2003.

1575
01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:49.552
The prison psychiatrist wrote.

1576
01:26:49.552 --> 01:26:51.684
"Awkward young man.
downcast gaze.

1577
01:26:51.684 --> 01:26:53.947
Childhood head trauma:
gunshots."

1578
01:26:53.947 --> 01:26:55.645
Three months later.

1579
01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:57.299
"Extremely sensitive
to sound and light.

1580
01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.214
"Unable to sleep.

1581
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.781
"Prefers solitary confinement
to general population.

1582
01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:04.828
Applies for permanent transfer.
Denied."

1583
01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:06.569
No credit card.
no home address.

1584
01:27:06.569 --> 01:27:07.874
no Social Security.

1585
01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:09.789
He's a ghost.

1586
01:27:27.677 --> 01:27:30.288
You have
reached your destination.

1587
01:27:32.943 --> 01:27:34.597
We have to call Mac.

1588
01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:36.120
Not yet.

1589
01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.774
Calling Mac
is calling the Bureau.

1590
01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:39.384
They send tactical.

1591
01:27:39.384 --> 01:27:41.473
they blow whatever lead
is waiting in there.

1592
01:27:41.473 --> 01:27:43.170
What if he's in there?

1593
01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:46.173
Then we're giving him
an extra hour to escape.

1594
01:27:46.173 --> 01:27:48.132
He's a trained killer
with a stockpile of weapons.

1595
01:27:48.132 --> 01:27:49.655
I am calling Mac right now.

1596
01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:50.917
And erase us both
from the case?

1597
01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:53.833
Just when we've cracked it?

1598
01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:56.488
No. Eleanor.
They put me down like a dog.

1599
01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:58.490
Now. I'm gonna carry
that guy's head

1600
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:00.536
right into
the J. Edgar Hoover Building

1601
01:28:00.536 --> 01:28:02.059
and write a bestseller
about it.

1602
01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:03.408
Guess who's the protagonist.

1603
01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:06.019
-  Fuck!

1604
01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:09.458
No. Cool down.

1605
01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:12.287
Fuck.

1606
01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:15.594
Good evening. Mrs. Possey.

1607
01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:19.250
You know who I am?

1608
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:20.991
I know what those plates mean.

1609
01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:26.039
I haven't seen him
for a long time.

1610
01:28:26.039 --> 01:28:27.432
Sorry.

1611
01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:29.042
Arrest me or leave.

1612
01:28:29.042 --> 01:28:31.044
I'm not helping you
kill my son.

1613
01:28:31.044 --> 01:28:33.569
You can help us
catch him alive.

1614
01:28:33.569 --> 01:28:36.311
That's no one else's priority.

1615
01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:44.319
Last time he stepped by was...

1616
01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:47.844
...during the virus.

1617
01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:52.370
Everybody locked
in their houses.

1618
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:55.330
Dean was roaming free.

1619
01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.594
A nomad king.

1620
01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:02.380
I haven't seen him so happy
since he was a child.

1621
01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.078
Is there anywhere else
he could be hiding?

1622
01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:07.080
There's nowhere he couldn't.

1623
01:29:08.778 --> 01:29:11.302
He used to stay in camps.
then parks.

1624
01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:14.349
Then he started sleeping
in empty houses.

1625
01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:20.224
I always knew that. um...

1626
01:29:20.224 --> 01:29:23.488
he would eventually
get into trouble. but...

1627
01:29:23.488 --> 01:29:25.969
I never expected
anything like this.

1628
01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:28.928
Mrs. Possey. who shot him?

1629
01:29:28.928 --> 01:29:30.887
We did.

1630
01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:37.502
Dean was a great little kid.

1631
01:29:37.502 --> 01:29:41.114
He was funny and smart.

1632
01:29:41.114 --> 01:29:43.682
And always wanted to help.
so Arthur would send him

1633
01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:46.293
out into the woods
to collect the targets.

1634
01:29:47.294 --> 01:29:50.428
That day...

1635
01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:52.735
he didn't realize
he was still out there.

1636
01:29:57.348 --> 01:29:59.045
Bang.

1637
01:29:59.045 --> 01:30:01.004
Two pellets
got him in the head.

1638
01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:04.877
Six years old--
can you imagine?

1639
01:30:04.877 --> 01:30:08.315
He was laid up
for almost a year.

1640
01:30:08.315 --> 01:30:10.143
Nearly died.

1641
01:30:10.143 --> 01:30:12.232
Now I wish he did.

1642
01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:16.149
We never forgave each other.

1643
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:19.849
I blamed him for not checking.

1644
01:30:19.849 --> 01:30:22.547
He blamed me
'cause it was my watch.

1645
01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:26.725
We were both right.

1646
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.947
Dean was never
the same after that.

1647
01:30:30.947 --> 01:30:33.515
Still smart.
but he started hating school

1648
01:30:33.515 --> 01:30:38.215
and birthday parties.
which he used to love.

1649
01:30:38.215 --> 01:30:40.391
Kids can be cruel. you know.

1650
01:30:40.391 --> 01:30:42.915
So your husband trained him
to defend himself?

1651
01:30:42.915 --> 01:30:44.656
Not only.

1652
01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:47.920
He wanted to give him
a future in the Army.

1653
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.619
And. uh...

1654
01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:53.491
and Dean was talented.

1655
01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:56.494
He just wasn't violent.

1656
01:30:57.626 --> 01:30:59.497
Not back then.

1657
01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:01.325
He liked to look
through the scope

1658
01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.545
at insects and birds.

1659
01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:06.199
He'd spend hours lying
in the grass with his rifle

1660
01:31:06.199 --> 01:31:09.028
just looking at the moon.

1661
01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:11.422
Not surprisingly.
they rejected him.

1662
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.295
"Unfit for service."

1663
01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.476
That broke Arthur's heart.

1664
01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:40.190
Sir...

1665
01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:47.240
No. don't!

1666
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.504
- He'll shoot you. Don't move.

1667
01:31:51.244 --> 01:31:52.637
He'll kill you.

1668
01:31:52.637 --> 01:31:54.770
He will kill you.

1669
01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:01.951
You said you could help.

1670
01:32:01.951 --> 01:32:03.561
How?

1671
01:32:04.606 --> 01:32:06.085
How?!

1672
01:32:06.085 --> 01:32:08.610
You said that
you could keep him alive.

1673
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.133
so what can you do?

1674
01:32:15.878 --> 01:32:17.836
The horn was for him?

1675
01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:19.229
Yes.

1676
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:21.797
- That means he trusts you.
- Yes.

1677
01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:26.366
Here's what you're gonna do.

1678
01:32:26.366 --> 01:32:27.977
Come get my phone.

1679
01:32:27.977 --> 01:32:29.369
Get my gun.

1680
01:32:37.726 --> 01:32:39.031
Get his. too.

1681
01:33:06.668 --> 01:33:08.583
Dean!

1682
01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.411
- She's here to help!

1683
01:33:12.499 --> 01:33:14.501
She says she's off the case.

1684
01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:16.503
No one knows they're here.

1685
01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:20.551
I believe her. and I think
that you should. too.

1686
01:33:20.551 --> 01:33:24.599
With your medical history.
she can keep you out of jail.

1687
01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.644
You'd be going to Dalloway.

1688
01:33:26.644 --> 01:33:28.777
It's a facility in the woods.

1689
01:33:33.999 --> 01:33:35.566
I mean. Dean. come on.

1690
01:33:35.566 --> 01:33:36.959
It's got to stop.

1691
01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:39.570
Look what you've done.

1692
01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.833
You must surrender.

1693
01:33:56.108 --> 01:33:57.588
Son?

1694
01:33:58.981 --> 01:34:01.374
If you won't go with them...

1695
01:34:03.159 --> 01:34:05.161
...come with me.

1696
01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:24.702
ELEANOR [voice trembling]:
Oh. God. Oh. fuck.

1697
01:34:24.702 --> 01:34:26.965
Oh. fuck.

1698
01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.885
I always thought
I'd die before her.

1699
01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:06.238
L-Listen. Dean.

1700
01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:08.371
- My name is Eleanor.
- Don't.

1701
01:36:08.371 --> 01:36:10.547
Don't do that.
Don't use your bullshit

1702
01:36:10.547 --> 01:36:12.375
police academy
tactics training on me.

1703
01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:14.072
I'm not that guy.

1704
01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:17.249
I'm not some drugged-out nutjob

1705
01:36:17.249 --> 01:36:19.425
you can stall
by agreeing with me

1706
01:36:19.425 --> 01:36:22.254
and using my first name
like we're neighbors.

1707
01:36:22.254 --> 01:36:24.822
You came here to kill me.
not to borrow a cup of sugar.

1708
01:36:24.822 --> 01:36:26.606
So don't tell me
you care for me.

1709
01:36:26.606 --> 01:36:28.826
'cause I can see
that you don't.

1710
01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:30.654
Your one chance
at a painless release

1711
01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:32.917
is not to lie
like everybody else.

1712
01:36:35.615 --> 01:36:37.966
Well. you're wrong.

1713
01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:41.839
They brought me in because they
thought I'd understand you.

1714
01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:44.711
- That I could empathize.
- Finally.

1715
01:36:44.711 --> 01:36:48.846
I kill 200 people.
then someone gives a shit.

1716
01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:50.761
You making any progress?

1717
01:36:50.761 --> 01:36:52.371
Well. I'm here.

1718
01:36:54.504 --> 01:36:56.593
And I'm not afraid of dying.

1719
01:36:56.593 --> 01:37:01.467
Sometimes I hate myself
so much that I want to die.

1720
01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:03.600
And sometimes I think
it'd be a lot easier

1721
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.428
to love myself more

1722
01:37:05.428 --> 01:37:07.778
if everyone else
was blown off the map.

1723
01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:11.303
But they won't be.

1724
01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:16.439
This doesn't hurt. Dean.

1725
01:37:16.439 --> 01:37:18.310
You are entertainment.

1726
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:19.877
You're time on screen.

1727
01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:22.227
They measure you in clicks.

1728
01:37:23.315 --> 01:37:25.230
And they want more.

1729
01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:28.277
More action. more blood.

1730
01:37:28.277 --> 01:37:30.192
Change the narrative.
Go to jail.

1731
01:37:30.192 --> 01:37:32.672
Just if you can
explain to everyone

1732
01:37:32.672 --> 01:37:34.370
why it made sense to you

1733
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.676
to grab a weapon
and start shooting people...

1734
01:37:36.676 --> 01:37:38.287
What doesn't make sense
about it?

1735
01:37:38.287 --> 01:37:41.725
People make so much noise.

1736
01:37:41.725 --> 01:37:44.119
Year after year. shouting
at some stupid fireworks.

1737
01:37:44.119 --> 01:37:46.904
as if silence and darkness
were enemies to defeat.

1738
01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:49.428
Go back to your fucking caves.

1739
01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:53.563
At night. there are
so many lights on

1740
01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:55.652
you can't even see the stars.

1741
01:37:57.001 --> 01:38:01.092
I want time. I want space.

1742
01:38:01.092 --> 01:38:03.921
They want things.

1743
01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:06.837
Fuck them.

1744
01:38:06.837 --> 01:38:09.187
You've either got to be
very stupid or very asleep

1745
01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:11.233
to find this game entertaining.

1746
01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:12.930
People scrubbing.

1747
01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:15.498
cleaning up other people's shit
for 12 hours a day

1748
01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:17.065
for a handful of green paper?

1749
01:38:17.065 --> 01:38:18.936
Not me.

1750
01:38:18.936 --> 01:38:20.633
Not anymore.

1751
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:26.552
Believe me. I. um... I know
what you're talking about.

1752
01:38:29.164 --> 01:38:31.949
I just wish
we'd had this conversation

1753
01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:33.864
before you crossed the line.

1754
01:38:40.958 --> 01:38:44.396
I went to
the slaughterhouse today.

1755
01:38:44.396 --> 01:38:47.573
There was a woman. Ramona.

1756
01:38:47.573 --> 01:38:50.533
She seemed fond of you.

1757
01:38:50.533 --> 01:38:52.100
Yeah.

1758
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.406
She wasn't bad.

1759
01:38:54.406 --> 01:38:57.148
That place. though...

1760
01:38:58.367 --> 01:39:01.065
One morning.
after an all-nighter.

1761
01:39:01.065 --> 01:39:03.981
I traced the cow's path backwards.

1762
01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:07.202
Started in the burger section.
went through cutting.

1763
01:39:07.202 --> 01:39:11.423
saw the cows getting skinned
and cut in two.

1764
01:39:11.423 --> 01:39:14.165
then the cows getting
the bolt to the head.

1765
01:39:14.165 --> 01:39:17.777
Then I followed a truck
back to the farm.

1766
01:39:17.777 --> 01:39:20.737
Jumped a fence.

1767
01:39:20.737 --> 01:39:22.957
walked around the lake.
and there they were.

1768
01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:27.135
Magnificent.

1769
01:39:27.135 --> 01:39:30.834
They seemed grateful
for their existence.

1770
01:39:32.096 --> 01:39:34.272
They didn't want to change.

1771
01:39:34.272 --> 01:39:36.753
Didn't want to evolve.

1772
01:39:36.753 --> 01:39:40.931
They just wanted to be there. breathing.

1773
01:39:40.931 --> 01:39:43.020
To live and die.

1774
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.370
then dissipate
back into the whole.

1775
01:39:47.416 --> 01:39:49.374
Isn't that what we all want?

1776
01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:54.901
Why don't you just go away?

1777
01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:56.816
I'm sure there's a place
you can go live

1778
01:39:56.816 --> 01:39:58.688
like the cows out on the farm.

1779
01:39:58.688 --> 01:40:00.211
Nah.

1780
01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:05.303
Everywhere you go
belongs to someone.

1781
01:40:05.303 --> 01:40:07.044
Everywhere you go.
you got to have money.

1782
01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:08.698
They-they got to know
who you are.

1783
01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:11.962
They... they're always
checking up on you.

1784
01:40:11.962 --> 01:40:13.833
They're always asking.

1785
01:40:13.833 --> 01:40:15.661
They're always watching.

1786
01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:18.360
Now they got drones.

1787
01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.233
satellites spying
from outer space.

1788
01:40:22.233 --> 01:40:24.540
This whole planet's
a fucking prison.

1789
01:40:25.932 --> 01:40:28.022
Why do I have to play
by your rules?

1790
01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:30.981
I don't know how to make money.

1791
01:40:30.981 --> 01:40:33.549
I don't know
how to win votes.

1792
01:40:34.724 --> 01:40:37.248
But who has the real power?

1793
01:40:37.248 --> 01:40:39.946
Life and death
from a thousand feet away.

1794
01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:46.605
I may not find peace.
but I can deliver retribution.

1795
01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:51.697
Retribution is not
what you need.

1796
01:40:51.697 --> 01:40:53.786
What. then?

1797
01:40:53.786 --> 01:40:55.223
Love?

1798
01:40:55.223 --> 01:40:58.095
Yes.

1799
01:40:58.095 --> 01:40:59.879
Some of us have been
so mistreated

1800
01:40:59.879 --> 01:41:03.274
we don't even know whatit's lik.

1801
01:41:03.274 --> 01:41:06.190
They burned
our bridges to pleasure.

1802
01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:08.279
But I think
they can be rebuilt.

1803
01:41:09.237 --> 01:41:11.587
Nah.

1804
01:41:11.587 --> 01:41:13.284
Too late for me.

1805
01:41:14.285 --> 01:41:16.070
That train's gone.

1806
01:41:17.506 --> 01:41:19.203
I appreciate the effort. though.

1807
01:41:20.465 --> 01:41:22.946
Don't worry. There's no next.

1808
01:41:22.946 --> 01:41:25.122
You're still alive
for a reason.

1809
01:41:25.122 --> 01:41:28.517
You said you wanted to help me.
well. this is how.

1810
01:41:28.517 --> 01:41:29.909
I want to go over there.

1811
01:41:29.909 --> 01:41:32.347
I want to lay down next to her.

1812
01:41:32.347 --> 01:41:34.653
I want to hug her
like when I was a kid.

1813
01:41:34.653 --> 01:41:36.481
And you're gonna wait
till I fall asleep.

1814
01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:38.614
I'm real tired. It'll be quick.

1815
01:41:38.614 --> 01:41:41.530
Then you're gonna
shoot me in the head.

1816
01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:43.836
I don't want my corpse
all over the news.

1817
01:41:43.836 --> 01:41:45.664
So you take that can
of gasoline.

1818
01:41:45.664 --> 01:41:48.972
you pour it over us
and set us on fire.

1819
01:41:48.972 --> 01:41:51.061
When the barbecue's done.

1820
01:41:51.061 --> 01:41:54.282
you call your friends
and you pick up your trophy.

1821
01:41:54.282 --> 01:41:56.327
That a deal?

1822
01:41:56.327 --> 01:41:58.242
Eleanor?

1823
01:42:01.463 --> 01:42:03.595
Yes. Dean.

1824
01:42:03.595 --> 01:42:06.294
I'd kindly and respectfully
execute you.

1825
01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:14.128
You think I'm stupid?

1826
01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.825
No. Dean.

1827
01:43:10.314 --> 01:43:12.447
Don't. Dean!

1828
01:43:12.447 --> 01:43:14.579
Stop!

1829
01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:19.018
Help! Help!

1830
01:43:19.018 --> 01:43:21.934
Mrs. Possey. open the door.

1831
01:43:21.934 --> 01:43:23.109
Dean!

1832
01:43:24.154 --> 01:43:28.202
Stop! Dean. I'm not wired.

1833
01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:29.942
Someone must have heard
the shots.

1834
01:43:29.942 --> 01:43:32.162
I'm not wired!

1835
01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:34.077
Mrs. Possey. police.

1836
01:43:34.077 --> 01:43:37.820
Dean. stop!

1837
01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.474
Listen to me!

1838
01:43:50.789 --> 01:43:52.661
ELEANOR [muffled]:
Dean!

1839
01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.971
Fuck.

1840
01:44:05.369 --> 01:44:07.589
Shots fired!
Shots fired from the shed!

1841
01:44:08.981 --> 01:44:10.983
Dean!

1842
01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:12.550
Why?

1843
01:44:14.422 --> 01:44:17.555
Some kid just lost their father
all 'cause you're conflicted?

1844
01:44:18.817 --> 01:44:21.864
Dean. you have to stop.

1845
01:44:35.399 --> 01:44:37.662
These people have families.

1846
01:44:37.662 --> 01:44:39.708
You are giving them decades
of suffering

1847
01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:41.710
while everything you hate
stays the same.

1848
01:44:48.543 --> 01:44:49.935
Fuck!

1849
01:44:59.815 --> 01:45:01.904
I know you're listening to me.

1850
01:45:01.904 --> 01:45:03.471
Kill me if you're not.

1851
01:45:04.907 --> 01:45:07.344
You're the one
who wants to stop.

1852
01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:10.347
Five minutes ago. you asked me

1853
01:45:10.347 --> 01:45:13.959
to shoot you in the head
and burn your body.

1854
01:45:13.959 --> 01:45:15.787
That proves how tired you are

1855
01:45:15.787 --> 01:45:18.312
and how unnecessary
all of this is.

1856
01:45:19.878 --> 01:45:20.923
Look at me!

1857
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.322
Mr. Possey. you're surrounded!

1858
01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:32.064
Get out of the shed right now
with your arms raised!

1859
01:45:32.064 --> 01:45:34.371
You said it was over.

1860
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:36.330
Untie me.
and let me handle them.

1861
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.157
You know I'll do
what's best for you.

1862
01:45:38.157 --> 01:45:40.638
Mr. Possey.

1863
01:45:40.638 --> 01:45:43.728
I want you to walk
out of there right now.

1864
01:45:43.728 --> 01:45:46.383
and I want you
to do it slowly. okay?

1865
01:45:46.383 --> 01:45:49.081
Come the fuck out. asshole!

1866
01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:51.736
Dean.

1867
01:45:51.736 --> 01:45:54.260
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1868
01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.610
My boss's car.

1869
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:57.394
By now. they know I'm here.

1870
01:45:57.394 --> 01:45:59.265
If they know I'm alive.
then they won't fire.

1871
01:45:59.265 --> 01:46:01.746
Come out. motherfucker!

1872
01:46:01.746 --> 01:46:02.921
Dean. Dean.

1873
01:46:02.921 --> 01:46:06.185
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1874
01:46:06.185 --> 01:46:08.100
The minute that you get booked.

1875
01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.755
I will make sure that
you get the help you need.

1876
01:46:10.755 --> 01:46:12.104
Medication.

1877
01:46:12.104 --> 01:46:13.715
That shit works.

1878
01:46:13.715 --> 01:46:15.412
You'll sleep like a baby.

1879
01:46:15.412 --> 01:46:17.109
And when you open
your eyes again. I will be

1880
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:18.850
right there to help you
get through this.

1881
01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:20.678
I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.

1882
01:46:20.678 --> 01:46:22.724
Dean. Dean. you don't
have to untie me.

1883
01:46:22.724 --> 01:46:25.074
but just stay like this.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1884
01:46:25.074 --> 01:46:27.119
Four!

1885
01:46:28.077 --> 01:46:30.035
Put that down. please.

1886
01:46:30.035 --> 01:46:31.385
Three!

1887
01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:36.912
- Get out!
- Two!

1888
01:46:36.912 --> 01:46:40.698
Dean. put that down.
or you have to kill yourself.

1889
01:46:40.698 --> 01:46:42.134
One!

1890
01:46:42.134 --> 01:46:44.310
I'm sorry. but you have to.
Do it!

1891
01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.357
Time's up. asshole!

1892
01:47:59.168 --> 01:48:00.691
- Stay right where you are!

1893
01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:02.388
- Show me your hands!
- Don't fucking move!

1894
01:48:02.388 --> 01:48:04.042
Wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait!

1895
01:48:04.042 --> 01:48:06.218
Hold! Hold!

1896
01:48:06.218 --> 01:48:08.133
He's alive.
Eleanor?

1897
01:48:08.133 --> 01:48:10.048
He's wounded. but he's alive.

1898
01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:13.704
What the hell happened?

1899
01:48:13.704 --> 01:48:15.184
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried. I really tried.

1900
01:48:15.184 --> 01:48:16.490
- What?
- Lammark wouldn't let me.

1901
01:48:23.322 --> 01:48:25.194
- OFFICER [over radio]:
- All units..

1902
01:48:25.194 --> 01:48:26.848
We need more men on the ground.

1903
01:48:33.028 --> 01:48:34.986
OFFICER [over radio]: They
traversed out to the river.

1904
01:48:34.986 --> 01:48:37.380
- Distribute weapons and vests.
Copy that.

1905
01:48:40.992 --> 01:48:42.603
OFFICER [over radio]:
Chopper unit. stand by.

1906
01:49:07.236 --> 01:49:09.630
Canine team. looks
like we picked up a scent.

1907
01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:11.501
Copy that.
What's your location?

1908
01:49:11.501 --> 01:49:13.938
We're in sector nine.
heading south.

1909
01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:17.115
We have footprints.

1910
01:49:18.856 --> 01:49:20.728
Copy that.
Rerouting all mobile units.

1911
01:49:20.728 --> 01:49:22.860
Sector nine. factory site.

1912
01:50:49.947 --> 01:50:51.601
Eleanor. we went through
your debriefing.

1913
01:50:51.601 --> 01:50:53.342
and we came up
with this strategy.

1914
01:50:53.342 --> 01:50:55.910
Collectively.

1915
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:59.348
We hope you'll be happy
to sign.

1916
01:50:59.348 --> 01:51:01.829
The entire operation
will remain classified.

1917
01:51:01.829 --> 01:51:03.613
As far as
the record's concerned.

1918
01:51:03.613 --> 01:51:05.833
this was an authorized plan.

1919
01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:08.574
BPD and the Bureau cracked
the case. got our killer.

1920
01:51:08.574 --> 01:51:10.576
with the state government's
full support.

1921
01:51:10.576 --> 01:51:11.839
Period.

1922
01:51:11.839 --> 01:51:14.319
Not a word about
what happened in that house.

1923
01:51:14.319 --> 01:51:16.582
not a word
of your history with drugs.

1924
01:51:16.582 --> 01:51:19.934
However.
despite your previous record.

1925
01:51:19.934 --> 01:51:22.066
we all agreed that you've
more than proved yourself.

1926
01:51:22.066 --> 01:51:25.679
so the Bureau would like
to offer you a permanent post

1927
01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:27.724
as intelligence analyst.

1928
01:51:32.773 --> 01:51:35.036
Is this your way
of buying my silence?

1929
01:51:36.428 --> 01:51:38.561
You really expect me
to help cover up

1930
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:40.694
your incompetence.
your lack of judgment.

1931
01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:42.608
your willingness
to put lives at risk?

1932
01:51:42.608 --> 01:51:44.828
He's trying
to help you. Eleanor.

1933
01:51:44.828 --> 01:51:46.351
You were suspended.

1934
01:51:46.351 --> 01:51:48.571
Lammark had been fired.

1935
01:51:48.571 --> 01:51:51.487
But still.
you illegally contacted Lang.

1936
01:51:51.487 --> 01:51:53.576
interrogated him
without a lawyer

1937
01:51:53.576 --> 01:51:55.317
and set off
without authorization.

1938
01:51:55.317 --> 01:51:58.712
leading directly
to 17 extra fatalities.

1939
01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:00.757
So. instead of letting
the press make you a hero

1940
01:52:00.757 --> 01:52:04.065
for 15 minutes.
then destroying your life.

1941
01:52:04.065 --> 01:52:06.981
we're offering you
a way forward.

1942
01:52:18.819 --> 01:52:20.690
I want you to honor Lammark

1943
01:52:20.690 --> 01:52:23.911
with a posthumous
Medal of Valor.

1944
01:52:23.911 --> 01:52:27.001
And I want you to transfer his
full pension to his husband.

1945
01:52:29.307 --> 01:52:31.179
We can do that.

1946
01:52:32.833 --> 01:52:35.313
I don't want to be an analyst.

1947
01:52:35.313 --> 01:52:37.446
Make me special agent.
You know I deserve it.

1948
01:52:41.102 --> 01:52:42.973
Done.

1949
01:52:42.973 --> 01:52:45.715
Any tricks. now or later.
and I will let everyone know

1950
01:52:45.715 --> 01:52:47.848
that you have blood
on your hands.

1951
01:53:01.296 --> 01:53:03.951
Thanks. Eleanor.

1952
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:06.214
I'm glad
we understand each other.

1953
01:53:09.304 --> 01:53:11.001
We don't.

1954
01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:24.710
Good work. Falco.

1955
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:26.190
Thank you. sir.

1956
01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:05.839
LAMMARK [voice-over]:
We get this guy.

1957
01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:07.971
this all goes away.

1958
01:54:07.971 --> 01:54:12.019
and we can both do the job
we were meant to.
