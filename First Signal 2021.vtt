3
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.630
With president Helen Colton

4
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.740
arriving for the G7 Summit in Brussels.

5
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.030
the crisis in the Ukraine

6
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.680
will be the main issue discussed.

7
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.570
The other six leaders taking part

8
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.750
will also address issues on trade security

9
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.340
and climate change.

10
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.970
This will be the first G7 Summit

11
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.800
hosted by the European Union.

12
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.890
Originally. a G8 Summit was to take place

13
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.870
in Sochi. Russia. but
with that nation's invasion

14
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.160
and annexation of the
Crimea in Ukraine.

15
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.560
the decision was made to
expel Russia from this summit

16
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.280
and move it to Brussels.

17
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.380
With Russia. President Colton must manage

18
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.940
this diplomatic falling out

19
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.600
as the United States relies
on Russia's space program

20
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.350
to ferry astronauts to the
International Space Station.

21
00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:03.590
Do we have any idea what he wants?

22
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.010
No. Just wanted. more
like demanded a meeting.

23
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.307
- And he flew from Colorado to Brussels?

24
00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:10.657
- Well. it must be important.

25
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.853
- Bill?

26
00:03:12.853 --> 00:03:13.686
- Yes. Madam President.

27
00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:14.950
- I need a moment.

28
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.780
You want to start with this one. sir?

29
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.030
Yes. And the rest can
follow in this order.

30
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.410
- Coffee. Major?

31
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.056
- Oh no. Thank you.
sir. I am fully leaded.

32
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.123
Sir. do you think she'll believe us?

33
00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.097
- Believe? Well. that's a good question.

34
00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:43.271
But no matter what she believes
it won't change the facts.

35
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.610
Have you met the president?

36
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.670
- No. sir. I haven't.

37
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.580
I almost did when she
came to inspect Vandenberg

38
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.850
last month.

39
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.410
- Ah yes. Her surprise base inspections.

40
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.430
They aren't going as well as you'd think

41
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.350
- Sir?

42
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.183
- Oh. forget it.

43
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.970
Just a word of advice.

44
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.110
Colton uses Seward as a Pit Bull.

45
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.290
If she asks you a direct question.

46
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.400
you give her a complete answer.

47
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.610
The last thing you wanna do

48
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.110
is get into a debate with her.

49
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.220
Trust me.

50
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.150
- Understood. sir.

51
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.297
Well. anyone else-

52
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.538
- Excuse me. Who are you?

53
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.290
You must be General
Reager and Major Sampson.

54
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.910
- This is a closed door meeting.

55
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.210
- Yes. The door is closed.

56
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.070
I'm Cedric Yonah and
this is James Griffin.

57
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.300
- Well. excuse me. Mr. Yonah.
what is your purpose here?

58
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.170
- General. when I was
advised at this meeting.

59
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.410
my colleague and I were asked to attend.

60
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.140
- And who was that?

61
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.973
- Who was. what?

62
00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:42.120
- Who asked you to attend?

63
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.560
- General. Major. let's no
get off on the wrong foot.

64
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.637
shall we?

65
00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:48.580
You know as well as I. that on occasion.

66
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.943
outside experts are called in to assist.

67
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.426
- Madam President.

68
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.020
- General Reager. I haven't seen you

69
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.950
since that Navstar
launch of Cape Canaveral.

70
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.060
How's the Directorate?

71
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.310
- As always. Madam President. 100%.

72
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.940
Oh. I'd like you to meet
Major Ellen Sampson.

73
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.320
- Ah. Major Sampson. a pleasure.

74
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.477
- Likewise. Madam President.

75
00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:14.760
- And where were you stationed?

76
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.830
- Space and Missile Systems. El Segundo.

77
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.810
- Ah. I should figure when old
John here called a meeting.

78
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.340
that space would factor into it.

79
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.173
Welcome.

80
00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:22.513
- Thank you. Madam President.

81
00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:24.210
- Forgive me Madam President.

82
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.050
but I thought this was going
to be a closed meeting.

83
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.640
- Oh. my dear General. you know
my policy. always a witness

84
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.230
or in this case. an expert or two.

85
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.760
And of course. you both
know Elisabeth Seward.

86
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.740
my National Security Advisor.

87
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.573
- Elisabeth.

88
00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:38.406
- Ma'am.

89
00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:39.790
- General. Major.

90
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.390
Elisabeth. perhaps you could
introduce our other two guests.

91
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.223
although it looked like

92
00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:45.960
you were all exchanging
pleasantries when we walked in.

93
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.880
- Of a sort.

94
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.620
- General. Major. this is Cedric Yonah.

95
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.050
science attache to the
president and James Griffin.

96
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.890
who was with JPL and now the
Shinar Center of Science.

97
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.090
- Oh yes. the DC think
tank behind the upgrades

98
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.082
to the Deep Space Network.

99
00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:01.360
- The very one. Major.

100
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.780
No point in launching satellites

101
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.350
if we can't communicate with them.

102
00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:06.906
- Agreed.

103
00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:10.989
- Yonah. Yonah. that's
Hebrew for dove. isn't it?

104
00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:13.086
- It is.

105
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.310
- Well. now that we're all introduced.

106
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.780
General. this is your bailiwick.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.010
I can give you just about an hour.

108
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.150
- Thank you. Madam president

109
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.800
if you would all take your seats.

110
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.410
- That's a pretty old school setup

111
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.550
for this level of briefing.

112
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.180
- Old-school?

113
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.960
A Faraday shield is protecting this room

114
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.800
and the adjacent hallway
from electromagnetic fields.

115
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.970
- Wow. That explains
why the Secret Service

116
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.020
confiscated our cell phones
before we entered the elevator.

117
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.850
But there will be a
record of this meeting.

118
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.580
Simply put. there's a hole
in the president's schedule

119
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.230
because she's here.

120
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.350
How long do you think it will take

121
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.130
before some intrepid reporter
starts asking questions

122
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.820
that I'm just gonna guess
you don't want answered.

123
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.950
- Ma'am the answer is simple.

124
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.620
The Commander of Air Force Space Command

125
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.220
requested an emergency
meeting with the president

126
00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:11.320
- And as Commander.

127
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.350
I must protest the presence
of these two civilians.

128
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.760
They're not part of my command.

129
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.324
- No. They're part of mine.
Shall we get on with it?

130
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.373
- Of course. Madam President. Major.

131
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.890
This point in space is
known as Lagrange Point Two.

132
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.920
Just about 1 million miles from Earth.

133
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.230
This is one of five such celestial
points relative to Earth.

134
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.860
but is the Lagrange Point Two

135
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.793
that observes the Earth. Moon and Sun.

136
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.280
They're called parking places in space

137
00:07:48.116 --> 00:07:50.120
because the combined gravitational forces

138
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.330
of all three bodies create
a place of equilibrium.

139
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.800
So a satellite can literally park there

140
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.863
and make observations.

141
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.080
- Madam President. when
the James Webb Telescope

142
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.093
launches in 2019. it'll
be parked at this point.

143
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.233
Sorry. General.

144
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.933
- Please tell me you
didn't request this meeting

145
00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:12.810
to give me a science lesson.

146
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.773
- No. Madam president. Next slide.

147
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.220
You mentioned the Directorate earlier.

148
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.990
As you know. the Directorate
overseas GPS launch. military

149
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.550
and other highly classified communications

150
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.773
for the Department of Defense.

151
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.920
You're looking at a Milstar satellite

152
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.440
in geostationary orbit.

153
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.423
And that orbit is about
24.000 miles from earth.

154
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.120
As you may know. Madam President.

155
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.280
we have five of these military
communication satellites

156
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.113
in orbit.

157
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.790
On August 15 last year. this
satellite intercepted a signal

158
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.723
that originated from Lagrange Point Two.

159
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.660
At first. our concern was
that someone was trying

160
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.733
to hack into Milstar.

161
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.585
but at the time that
didn't seem to be the case.

162
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:08.660
- Why is that?

163
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.320
- The only satellite operating in LG2

164
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.253
is a European Space Agency
space observatory called. Gaia.

165
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.647
And it's not configured to
communicate with Milstar.

166
00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:24.008
- Then what was it?

167
00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:27.360
- Another satellite.

168
00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:35.200
- But you just said that the
only one operating there was...

169
00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:37.260
- Gaia.

170
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.110
- Yes. Thank you.

171
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.140
- Who intercepted the signal?

172
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.973
- My unit did

173
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.190
- Sure. It wasn't an Earth-based
signal that reflected

174
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.270
off some piece of space debris?

175
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.360
- Positive.

176
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.070
- Major. science isn't about positives.

177
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.800
It's about a probable set of
conclusions based on facts.

178
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.760
- Emissions from a neutron star?

179
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.420
- Negative.

180
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.253
- Comment?

181
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.523
- Negative.

182
00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:03.560
This signal was in the upper band

183
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.830
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

184
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.663
- What part?

185
00:10:06.663 --> 00:10:08.210
X-ray. and before you tell me

186
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.160
it's not possible scientifically.

187
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.380
you know. as well as I.
that NASA has been looking

188
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.420
into X-ray transmissions.

189
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.840
- But it's not NASA.

190
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.240
- No. and it's not the Europeans.

191
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.960
- But this signal could be faked.

192
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.960
- Sure. If there was a
transmitter 900 AUs from Earth.

193
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.130
but considering Voyager 1 is
just over 100 AUs from Earth.

194
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.860
I would say it's unlikely.

195
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.570
- Look. this could be Russia. China.

196
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.730
hell. it could be Iran. for all we know.

197
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.910
- Madam President. With all due respect.

198
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.210
there isn't a satellite launch

199
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.763
from this planet that we don't know about.

200
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:12.150
- General. what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

201
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.053
Madam President.

202
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.400
it was a satellite of
extraterrestrial origin.

203
00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.120
- Dear God.

204
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.090
General. how did you get this picture?

205
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.460
- Yes. how did you?

206
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.450
Satellites are next to
impossible to image?

207
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.820
there's virtually no ambient light in space.

208
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.290
- To be frank. we got very lucky.

209
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.640
Major. do we have a slide of the X-37?

210
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.840
- Yes sir. I believe so.

211
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.750
- We're being watched

212
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.510
So it would it seem.

213
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.360
- But by who or what?

214
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.410
- Madam President. if I may.

215
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.720
just bring us all back
to Earth for a moment.

216
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.500
Since the Soviet Union
launched Sputnik in 1957

217
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.150
there have been over what?

218
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.230
6.000 satellites launched into space?

219
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.610
This predates the National
Reconnaissance Office

220
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.183
and the Space Surveillance Networks.

221
00:12:50.183 --> 00:12:52.030
I agree with the general
that the United States tracks

222
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.554
all watches from around the
world now. but in the 1960s.

223
00:12:55.554 --> 00:12:57.910
'70s. even '80s.

224
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.423
come on. it wasn't technically
possible back then.

225
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.330
- I had no idea you were such

226
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.380
a historian on space. Elisabeth.

227
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.020
- That's why I'm here. I briefed her.

228
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.853
- Oh. did you?

229
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.703
Interesting.

230
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.103
- Ready. sir.

231
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.960
- Thank you. Major.

232
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.420
Madam President.

233
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.193
you're familiar with the
Boeing X-37 space plane.

234
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.450
On the day of discovery.

235
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.233
this plane was on its second test flight.

236
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.820
On my order. I sent the plane to the LG2

237
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.403
where the signal originated.

238
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.183
with on-board lights and cameras.

239
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.210
the following images were produced.

240
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.670
- Well. thank you for confirming
the rumored EM drive.

241
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.920
but that still doesn't confirm

242
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.780
that it's extra terrestrial in origin.

243
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.970
- Oh. it does.

244
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.100
When the satellite engages
its engine and leave quickly.

245
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.651
We haven't been able to track it since.

246
00:14:00.651 --> 00:14:02.490
- Then all you have. General is a picture

247
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.798
that could lend itself to
a science fiction story.

248
00:14:05.798 --> 00:14:09.320
Mr. Science Attache.

249
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.420
in addition to the X-ray
transmission that we have.

250
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.420
the X- 37 also recorded some
very interesting readings.

251
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.523
- What kind?

252
00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:20.140
- Propulsion.

253
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.483
Yes. we have an experimental
ION drive on the X-37.

254
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.440
but that pales in comparison
to the anti-gravity drive

255
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.573
on the satellite.

256
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.900
So we're no longer in the
world of science fiction.

257
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.400
but fact. and the fact
remains Madam President.

258
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.520
that a satellite of
extra terrestrial origin

259
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.630
was discovered at LG2

260
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.590
with communication and
propulsion technologies

261
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.373
that do not exist on Earth.

262
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.560
- Who else knows about this?

263
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.400
- Aside from those in this room.

264
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.140
only a handful of techs
from Sampson's unit

265
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.263
and Senator Hadrian.

266
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.570
The signal telemetry and
mission records of the X-37

267
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.168
are now controlled by my office.

268
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.930
- You know. if Sorenson
finds out about this

269
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.650
or any of these other
alien disclosure groups

270
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.010
were in of it.

271
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.980
- Sorenson?

272
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.750
- Oh. a political activist that heads up

273
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.640
Solar Research Group.

274
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.290
He tried putting pressure on the president

275
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.210
to disclose what she knew about UFOs

276
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.400
or more precisely. the extra
terrestrial presence issue.

277
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.050
- Christ. I need some coffee.

278
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.003
Let's take five.

279
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.100
- Government has painted
itself into a real corner

280
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.970
with this UFO matter.

281
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.860
Damned if they say something.
Damned if they don't.

282
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.221
They only believe what they see.

283
00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:00.971
- It doesn't matter. It's academic.

284
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.560
- Do you think Reager will
be a help or a hindrance?

285
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.113
- Please. he is a career
military officer on a mission.

286
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.610
Which actually it gives me an idea.

287
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.067
- What's your impression of the president?

288
00:16:19.557 --> 00:16:22.307
- If I dint know any better.
sir. I'd say she's scared.

289
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.543
- Aren't you? Hell. aren't we all?

290
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.470
With all that we know. we should
have seen this one coming.

291
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.927
Keep your eye on Cedric.

292
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.243
- That's not hard sir.
He's keeping them on me.

293
00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:45.620
- If an opportunity
presents itself. take it.

294
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.520
We need to know more about him.

295
00:16:53.393 --> 00:16:54.430
- I just can't believe this.

296
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.061
- Neither can I.

297
00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.930
- What would your advice be?

298
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.764
- Well. whatever happens.

299
00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:03.770
there's only one thing
you have to remember.

300
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.546
you're the president.

301
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.640
- Madam President. it was
truly an honor to meet you.

302
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.890
but I must beg to leave.

303
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.750
I have a flight today.

304
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.150
- Oh. I'm sorry to see you go.

305
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.520
I've enjoyed your commentary on this.

306
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.870
what are we calling it?

307
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.270
Development or discovery?

308
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.370
- Revelation.

309
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.750
- That's as good a word as any.

310
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.990
James. I'd like you to stay in touch

311
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.210
with Elisabeth's office.

312
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.210
I might have some follow-up
questions for you.

313
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.850
- Of course. Madam President.

314
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.983
- Leaving in the middle of
a presidential briefing.

315
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.120
- I thought you'd be happy. General.

316
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.400
- What could possibly be more important?

317
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.517
- You know the old adage.
ask me no questions.

318
00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:53.750
- And I'll tell you no lies.

319
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.280
- Imagine if we did that in Washington

320
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.290
- Mr. Griffin. I do want to remind you.

321
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.803
this meeting is classified.

322
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.630
- General. you have my word that no one

323
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.163
on this planet will know.

324
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.500
Madam President. Madam Advisor. General. Major.

325
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.330
- Safe travels.

326
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.313
- Bill. I need to get to the
field as quickly as possible.

327
00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:40.372
Yes. sir.

328
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.920
- General. forgive the obvious.

329
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.020
you discovered this alleged alien-

330
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.730
- There's nothing alleged about it.

331
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.200
- You don't mind if I finish. do you?

332
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.300
You discovered this
satellite on August 15th.

333
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.040
why are we just hearing
about this now on June 4th.

334
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.750
nearly a year after this incident?

335
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.480
- And why brief Senator Hadrian.

336
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.360
the Chairman of the Senate
Committee of Armed Services

337
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.673
before the president?

338
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.390
- They make a point. John.

339
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.173
I'd like an answer before you continue.

340
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.720
- To be frank Madam President.

341
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.080
we needed to be certain

342
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.610
there was something to brief you on

343
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.130
and to compartmentalize
the entire operation.

344
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.950
- You mean hide from inquiry?

345
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.913
- I mean keep it from the public.

346
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.340
That's why I went to Hadrian.

347
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.060
Do you think it's a good idea

348
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.290
for the public to know about this?

349
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.993
Do you? They can barely
handle bad weather.

350
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.280
That's the one downside
of a democracy disclosure

351
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.053
for some things that
just can't be disclosed.

352
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.440
and to ensure compliance
with any ridiculous

353
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.053
Freedom of Information Act requests.

354
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.903
the documentation has been
removed from government files.

355
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.030
Call it what you want.

356
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.533
I call it. protecting the
people from themselves.

357
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.683
And before you utter one more word.

358
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.280
the president will agree with me on this.

359
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.370
- He's right. Elisabeth.

360
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.850
There are just some matters of state

361
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.050
that can't be disclosed.

362
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.300
Speaking of disclosure.

363
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.620
I'd like to know where Mr.
Griffin went in such a hurry.

364
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.970
given his background

365
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.290
and the subject matter
that we're talking about.

366
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.783
Don't you find it odd
that he left so abruptly?

367
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:45.703
- Very well.

368
00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:48.750
He went to the European
Space Operations Center

369
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.850
in Darmstadt. Germany.

370
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.590
We want to know if the Gaia observatory

371
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.890
reported anything unusual.

372
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.990
We would've told you Madam President.

373
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.510
but we didn't want any
military interference.

374
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.520
- You're gonna have more than military-

375
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.840
- General. I'm satisfied.

376
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.360
Let's all secure from Defcon 3. shall we?

377
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.670
- It's a prudent action.

378
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.120
Albeit a bit underhanded.

379
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.880
- So you haven't been able
to track this satellite?

380
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.370
- Not the satellite itself.

381
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.471
- But I thought the satellite-

382
00:21:16.471 --> 00:21:17.804
- Communication.

383
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.420
After we ruled out a hack of Milstar.

384
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.590
we believe it came down to line of sight.

385
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.300
and that our satellite
simply got in the way.

386
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.050
- How did you possibly come
up with that conclusion?

387
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.220
- Our satellites don't communicate
the X-ray transmission.

388
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.070
Our satellite simply
recorded what it received

389
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.110
or more precisely what passed through it.

390
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.300
- But that still doesn't prove
your line of sight theory.

391
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.260
- It doesn't disprove it either.

392
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.630
It's a theory for many deductions.

393
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.350
Fact. no satellite launched from Earth

394
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.590
whether military or civilian communicates

395
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.440
via X-ray transmissions.

396
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.570
Fact. the signal terminated
over the Atlantic Ocean.

397
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.570
Fact. no military or civilian
aircraft. surface ships.

398
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.280
or submarines were anywhere near

399
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.140
the termination of the signal.

400
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.890
So where does that leave us?

401
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.380
- Your tell us. Major.

402
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.250
- You're familiar with Arthur Conan Doyle.

403
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.253
- Of course.

404
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.990
- Once you eliminate the impossible.

405
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.823
what remains no matter how
improbable. must be the truth.

406
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.723
Laugh all you want.

407
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.540
Madam President. we strongly
believe that this satellite

408
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.440
was communicating with something that.

409
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.940
well. something that we just can't see

410
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.250
because the fact remains that a signal

411
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.740
must be received by something.

412
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.500
The fact that we can't
see it does not mean

413
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.880
that it doesn't exist.

414
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.530
- Your conclusion is ridiculous.

415
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.540
- Not nearly as ridiculous
as your deliberate dismissal.

416
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.370
You're supposed to be the
National Security Adviser.

417
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.870
Aren't you the least bit
concerned about this?

418
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.480
- I'm concerned that Russia.

419
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.310
a member of the United
Nations Security Council

420
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.460
has invaded the Crimea and the
president should be talking

421
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.710
to her allies upstairs

422
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.370
rather than listening to
fantasy downstairs. okay?

423
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.170
I'm concerned that you are
wasting the president's time.

424
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.860
but hey. look. I get it.

425
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.693
You have a picture

426
00:23:12.693 --> 00:23:13.910
and a signal and you think that-

427
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.210
- Major. excuse me.

428
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.010
You are also painfully. aware
that X-ray can originate

429
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.410
from a supernova. other space phenomenon?

430
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.363
- But it does come down
to modulation. doesn't it?

431
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.403
A supernova isn't trying to communicate.

432
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.490
You also know. or maybe you don't.

433
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.740
that NASA has been experimenting
with this technology.

434
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.700
Madam President. if NASA is successful.

435
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.900
the result will be high-rates of data

436
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.170
transmitted over vast distances of space

437
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.060
and the ability to communicate
with hypersonic vehicles

438
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.960
during atmosphere. free entry.

439
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.040
Mr. Griffith would confirm
all this. but he's. oh yes.

440
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.993
he's left for ESOC.

441
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.010
- General. have you decoded
these transmissions?

442
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.180
- This is why it's taken so long

443
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.153
to bring this to your attention.

444
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.697
I'll take over. Major.

445
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.220
Madam President. what
I'm about to disclose

446
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.670
has a NATO security classification as CTS.

447
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.683
it's Cosmic Top Secret.

448
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.543
High security rating possible.

449
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.810
Before I continue. I
need your authorization

450
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.750
to declassify this information to him.

451
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.830
- I have more clearance
that you can possibly know.

452
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.296
- Not with me. you don't.

453
00:24:30.296 --> 00:24:31.897
- Madam President. a moment.

454
00:24:41.216 --> 00:24:42.730
Reager knows that Cedric is in this room

455
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.840
he has all necessary
clearances. why ask you?

456
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.710
- He wants to know
where my alliances fall.

457
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.770
He's plotting something.

458
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.336
What. I don't know yet. but
body language speaks volumes.

459
00:24:52.336 --> 00:24:53.169
Reager wants something.

460
00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:55.084
- And Cedric wants to know what.

461
00:24:55.084 --> 00:24:58.670
- We need to find out where this is going.

462
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.961
General. you have my authorization.

463
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.200
- The planet Earth

464
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.620
designated the Blue
Marble during Apollo 17.

465
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.570
Stunning. isn't it?

466
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.090
But here's what you have to know

467
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.503
if you plan to land on it.

468
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.543
There are presently over
3.500 satellites in orbit.

469
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.110
We are tracking over 500.000 pieces

470
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.240
of orbital debris.

471
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.133
Now this traffic is traveling
at 17.000 miles per hour.

472
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.090
in Earth's atmosphere. civilian
and military flight tracking

473
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.493
is just as important.

474
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.330
This year alone. there will
be over 100.000 civilian flights

475
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.440
around the world.

476
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.270
The Military. NATO. ESA

477
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.590
and other civilian and commercial
partners have to navigate

478
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.303
this traffic for more
reasons than I can count.

479
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.273
Apparently. so to those
that control this satellite.

480
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.120
- What exactly are you saying. General?

481
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.033
- Navigation.

482
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.620
This satellite wasn't
just observing earth.

483
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.440
It was communicating in the same way

484
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.633
that we communicate with
our spacecraft and aircraft.

485
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.060
It wasn't just imagery. either.

486
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.887
Transponder codes for all
civilian and military satellites

487
00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.713
and aircraft were recorded.

488
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.093
There were also weather
forecasting models.

489
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.623
We also found what we
believe to be a flight plan.

490
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.403
leaving from the Atlantic
ocean and off the planet.

491
00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.703
- A flight plan?

492
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.400
- Where did the plan track to?

493
00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.340
- That we don't know.

494
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.140
- Something isn't just watching us.

495
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.240
they're already here.

496
00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.363
- Precisely.

497
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.728
- It's curious. isn't it?

498
00:27:01.728 --> 00:27:03.010
- What is?

499
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:03.843
- This.

500
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.200
Governments spends billions
on space exploration

501
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.000
in the search for extra terrestrial life.

502
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.480
Earth scientists have discovered nearly 1000

503
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.633
extra solar planets. some
in the habitable zone.

504
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.080
Radio telescopes. beaming and beaming.

505
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.493
hoping to make contact.

506
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.170
And what happens?

507
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.300
You discover they're right here.

508
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.460
Congratulations. You can
both add another medal

509
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.630
to your fruit salads.

510
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.425
- Excuse me. That's disrespectful.

511
00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:38.870
- Cedric. the General and
Major are decorated officers

512
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.460
with a track record of outstanding-

513
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.050
- Madam President forgive
me. I mean. no disrespect.

514
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.800
It's a compliment to your command.

515
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.890
- Well. then compliment us
with your scientific insight

516
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.593
on what we may be dealing with.

517
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.820
- There are many insights we could make.

518
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.510
Just looking at the configuration
and size of the satellite

519
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.250
means that there could be a
similarity to Earth's development

520
00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.770
in terms of communications.

521
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.200
Anti gravity propulsion
though. that's a revolution.

522
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.663
If in fact the X-37 readings were correct.

523
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.610
It means the propulsion can be achieved

524
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.750
at near light. speed in space.

525
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.490
And on planets like Earth.

526
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.230
Gravity cancellation technology

527
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.340
would make conventional
airports and airplanes obsolete.

528
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.470
In essence. picture a helicopter

529
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.733
without the need for rotating blades.

530
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.100
Now. if such a satellite were to originate

531
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.530
from another solar system.

532
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.243
it could be one nearby. say
Gliese or Promixa Centauri.

533
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.890
Ask anyone who has worked in this field

534
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.730
and they'll tell you
the navigation of space

535
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.200
is complicated and dangerous.

536
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.580
It looks empty to the lay person.

537
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.230
but in fact is littered with
debris like Earth orbit.

538
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.260
Now for a long extended
journey they would need

539
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.690
or at least want something along the lines

540
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.230
of asteroid deflectors for starters.

541
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.630
- Asteroid deflectors?

542
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.410
- Yes. devices that fly apart.

543
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.830
but in concert with the
primary space vehicle

544
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.330
to repel. deflect or
even destroy space debris

545
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.920
that poses a threat to navigation.

546
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.950
NASA is working on a plan
now to install laser cannons

547
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.203
on the ISS for just such debris.

548
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.080
It's a shame the satellite disappeared.

549
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.860
Imagine the knowledge. if
it was reversed engineered.

550
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.240
Of course. there's one
thing you can't tell

551
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.600
from these images or
even the transmission.

552
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.900
- And what's that?

553
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.490
- How long the satellite
has been an orbit.

554
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.170
Could be one year. It could be 100.

555
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.020
It could be a thousand.

556
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.330
My point is. wherever they're from.

557
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.690
regardless of what they look like.

558
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.033
they are an advanced
civilization. but not infallible.

559
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.310
- The comm signal that
passed through our satellite.

560
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.143
- Exactly.

561
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.590
- What do you think they want?

562
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.930
- You don't need to be a
scientist to answer that.

563
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.413
Madam President.

564
00:29:54.413 --> 00:29:56.340
I would postulate the
same thing NASA wants

565
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.793
when new horizons
intercepts Pluto next year.

566
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.123
- Answers.

567
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.603
- Answers are something
that we need. Cedric.

568
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.603
So where do we go from here. General?

569
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.847
- It's not where we go. It's where we are.

570
00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.340
Using our military satellite networks

571
00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.640
in cooperation with other nations

572
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.470
and ground stations around the world.

573
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.960
I've assembled a team of
scientists and engineers

574
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.490
and various agencies to detect

575
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.523
and track this alien presence.

576
00:30:37.018 --> 00:30:40.820
But our present funding and
certain inter-agency rules

577
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.780
prohibit us from taking this further.

578
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.470
I need your authorization
to divert funding

579
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.930
from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration

580
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.273
Authorization Act of 2014.

581
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.380
This funding will be placed

582
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.460
at the National Reconnaissance Office

583
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.160
and administered by Space Command.

584
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.193
NASA won't ask any questions.

585
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.920
Any budget shortfall will
be handled by Congress

586
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.503
under Senator Hadrian's lead.

587
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.068
Operation Troy. Madam President.

588
00:31:33.998 --> 00:31:35.940
- What are you afraid of. General?

589
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.900
- It's not about being afraid.

590
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.250
It's about knowing who they
are and what they want.

591
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.060
And let us be clear.

592
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.500
nobody undertakes a multi
light year space journey

593
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.550
just because it's Monday.

594
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.097
- That's right. General. a journey.

595
00:31:51.097 --> 00:31:53.230
And you don't know what
they want or who they are.

596
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.330
You are assuming. just
on your actions alone.

597
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.950
they're malevolent.

598
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.960
- And what evidence do
you have that benevolent?

599
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.140
- Have they attacked you? No.

600
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.020
- We don't know that.

601
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.550
We don't know what they're doing here.

602
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.130
but they certainly have some
sort of stealth technology.

603
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.470
- And you don't?

604
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.600
Why do you fly your stealth bombers and drones

605
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.930
to hostile territory?

606
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.100
To protect yourself.

607
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.590
Has it dawned on you that
these. whatever they are.

608
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.640
are doing the same?

609
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.910
- No. it hasn't.

610
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.350
Because in our case. we
know who we're dealing with.

611
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.620
human beings

612
00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.200
- Mr. Yonah. this is about
military preparedness.

613
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.870
It's that simple.

614
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.170
We don't know what we're dealing with.

615
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.013
- Exactly. You don't.

616
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.850
This action into the unknown

617
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.450
could seriously put our
national security in jeopardy.

618
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.650
nevermind the security of our planet.

619
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.620
Isn't this the time to act
on fact rather than fiction?

620
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.200
- That's the point. to get some.

621
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.020
We are operating literally in the dark.

622
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.310
the darkness of space.

623
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.440
The whole point of Operation Troy.

624
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.160
is to shed light on this darkness.

625
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.463
- Indeed. This is a time
to study and investigate.

626
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.070
Can you imagine what you
could learn from them?

627
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.680
- All we've learned is
that we're being watched.

628
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.530
and our land air and space
assets are being tracked.

629
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.023
To what end. who knows?

630
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.557
- Would you not agree that this
discovery gives credence to.

631
00:33:18.557 --> 00:33:21.350
"Somewhere. something incredible
is waiting to be known?"

632
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.320
- This isn't the time or
place to quote Carl Sagan.

633
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.210
- That quote is mistakenly
attributed to him.

634
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.310
When in fact it was created by a reporter.

635
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.890
- What's your point. Cedric?

636
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.841
- My point Madam President.

637
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:35.620
is that in light of the
magnitude of this discovery

638
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.563
it's too easy for mistakes to be made.

639
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.270
- All you scientists are alike.

640
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.210
You deal with the unknown.
but you're remarkably.

641
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.080
predictable in your actions.

642
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.960
- As are you General. you
sadly deal in absolutes

643
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.700
because the unknown terrifies you

644
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.540
- General. if I sign this.

645
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.440
what's the objective of Operation Troy

646
00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.863
- Identification.

647
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.970
If they're going to watch
us. we'll return the favor.

648
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.590
The objective is to identify
where they are on this planet.

649
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.263
And if possible. the solar system.

650
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.493
Once identified.
communications will be open.

651
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.560
My concern. Madam President
is despite them being here.

652
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.793
they've made no effort
to communicate with us.

653
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.690
Instead of silent. stealth-like invasion

654
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.853
has already happened.

655
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.300
Just because a bomb hasn't been dropped

656
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.433
does not mean the war has not begun.

657
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.853
So yes. I am afraid.

658
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.280
Afraid of the unknown. as you
should be. Madam President

659
00:35:15.315 --> 00:35:17.730
and everyone else in room.

660
00:35:22.773 --> 00:35:26.630
- Your xenophobia. General
is painfully apparent.

661
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.673
what does Reager stand for?
Something Germanic. isn't it?

662
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.940
How fitting someone with a Germanic name

663
00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.000
talks about identifying people?

664
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.320
How fitting such a person
commands a military apparatus.

665
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.850
- How dare you compare me-

666
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.440
- I'm not comparing you
to anyone except yourself.

667
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.330
Unless people like me
speak up loud and often.

668
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.720
and at the moment it matters.

669
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.720
history is a strange
habit of repeating itself.

670
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.400
How many times in the history of mankind

671
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.460
have people been identified
by the fear of others?

672
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.600
How many times have they
been marked by the ignorance

673
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.800
of hate under the
organization of the state?

674
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.600
Those that wouldn't open their eyes.

675
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.120
those that failed to learn.

676
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.710
to make any attempt to understand

677
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.670
that just because you don't know someone

678
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.280
doesn't mean they're your enemy.

679
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.580
They could be your friend.

680
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.540
- A friend doesn't operate in stealth.

681
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.150
there in the open with
a hand of friendship

682
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.240
or at least curiosity.

683
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.630
Not some comm signal.

684
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.800
revealing the identification
of our planes.

685
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.123
our ships and our submarines.

686
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.280
With the exception of
you. everyone in this room

687
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.623
has taken the oath.

688
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:33.040
It's our job to protect this
country against enemies.

689
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.443
both foreign and domestic.

690
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.500
And if this doesn't qualify as foreign.

691
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.900
you can have all my stars

692
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.773
because that is exactly
where they're from.

693
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.260
And until the day comes
that they reveal themselves

694
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.980
and their intentions to us.

695
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.290
they will be treated as
a cancer in our world.

696
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.323
- And be eradicated.

697
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.960
You're right. General.

698
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.940
I haven't taken an oath

699
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.410
because how many times throughout history

700
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.330
do these oaths end in. "So help me. God."

701
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.220
You may be looking for
a divine intervention

702
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.830
if your plans bear fruit.

703
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.330
This fruit you so longingly
are looking to accomplish

704
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.470
could usher in a new revelation.

705
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.930
Has it even remotely occurred to you.

706
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.680
instead acting on fear of
what you don't understand.

707
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.667
you want to detect.
track and identify them.

708
00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:26.923
and you don't even know what them is.

709
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.290
I'm a man of science and
one could say a history.

710
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.830
when your government enacted
the Indian Removal Act.

711
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.760
it never occurred to President Jackson

712
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.270
that someday the Native Americans
unique place in the world

713
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.630
might be needed.

714
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.500
Thankfully. they and
their language survived

715
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.930
and helped you end a World War.

716
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.310
Has it occurred to you
that whoever they are

717
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.410
it might someday help
you in your hour of need.

718
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.230
Maybe they already are.

719
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.580
Do you want to identify them

720
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.230
because you were scared of
what you don't understand.

721
00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.610
If you don't want to understand
space. why look up.

722
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.270
keep your head down.

723
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.620
Thankfully Galileo never did.

724
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.780
But by looking up. he
went against the state.

725
00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.790
Not a state of arms. but
a state of mind and beliefs.

726
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.740
Beliefs so distorted centuries later.

727
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.430
that millions would detect track

728
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.860
and identified by a state so
consumed with fear from within

729
00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.203
they couldn't see without.

730
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.350
is ironic in so many ways
that you have a space program

731
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.730
that failed state.

732
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.000
A state that is now an ally.

733
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.940
whose Chancellor went before your Congress

734
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.897
and recounted one phrase of the
constitution that proclaims.

735
00:38:31.897 --> 00:38:34.017
"Human dignity shall be inviolable."

736
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.010
Sadly. the action you
are postulating today.

737
00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.820
is a violation of the dignity
and the oath you took.

738
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.590
Simply. "There is no price one can set

739
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.510
on the future of humanity
so long as it is tempered

740
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.950
with the best intentions of mankind."

741
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.230
You said those words. Madam
President to your Congress

742
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.983
to fund the space program.
not to militarize it.

743
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.440
I wonder what giant leap for mankind

744
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.890
will be attained if you signed this order.

745
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.556
Indeed. Madam President. the
Trojan horse in this room-

746
00:39:02.556 --> 00:39:03.632
- Sit down.

747
00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:23.132
well. what a
wonderful speech that was.

748
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.640
full of life. perspective
and replete with history.

749
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.623
but not one solid contemporary
idea on what we should do.

750
00:39:36.128 --> 00:39:38.470
The history is littered
with people like you.

751
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.890
all talk and no action.

752
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.940
Neville Chamberlain would have loved you.

753
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:52.190
But yes. I love this uniform
and what it represents.

754
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.700
And I have no problem.
issue. or reservation

755
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.940
saying that I support and
defend the constitution

756
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.073
of the United States. period.

757
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.660
And if that goes against
your moral standings

758
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.373
and sensibilities. so be it.

759
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.703
That's your right.

760
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.163
Because as an American.
you have that choice.

761
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.883
That's the beauty of the
constitution. freedom of choice.

762
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.603
And if that freedom gets
bloodied along the way. so be it.

763
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.920
But I no longer have the
time. inclination or interest

764
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.173
in debating this with you any longer.

765
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.870
I live in the here and now. not last week

766
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.883
and not seven centuries ago.

767
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.460
And though history may have
some lessons to learn from.

768
00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.883
I have no interest in
writing its last chapter.

769
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.800
And I'll be God damned

770
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.003
if something else writes it for us.

771
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.250
Forgive me. Madam President.

772
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.477
What say you?

773
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.290
- It seems odd. does it?

774
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.973
That we are here in a
bunker like wars long past.

775
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:52.120
But today we decide on a
fate that none of us know

776
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.100
or can even predict.

777
00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.530
I've always been a supporter
of the space program.

778
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.363
you know that.

779
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:02.000
But unlike presidents before me.

780
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.653
I am faced with the revelation
that mankind is not alone.

781
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.470
I have to believe that our intention

782
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:19.310
has always been one of science.
but let's not kid ourselves.

783
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.920
There's always been a
military component to this.

784
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.623
this next frontier.

785
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.200
This is about the science of anything.

786
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.240
We need to know who or
what we're dealing with

787
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.430
before we can deal with them.

788
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.740
They have the upper hand
of what we don't know.

789
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.253
but that is something
that we need to know.

790
00:42:42.915 --> 00:42:46.317
It's not about fear. but intelligence.

791
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.260
I think we can all agree that

792
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.060
before the New World was discovered.

793
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.220
all Erikson had was the horizon to look at

794
00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.577
and it stars to guide him.

795
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.790
but we need to know what the beyond this horizon.

796
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.653
and why out of over 200 billions stars.

797
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.380
they were guided to us.

798
00:43:24.149 --> 00:43:27.681
I'm sorry. it's this world first.

799
00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:43.213
God help us.

800
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:22.400
- Thank you. Madam President.

801
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.580
For obvious reasons.

802
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:32.250
updates will not appear on
your daily intelligence brief.

803
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.040
- You can update my
office. General I'll -

804
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.713
- I'll update the president.

805
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.780
- My job as the National
Security Advisor is to-

806
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.550
- Advise the president on
matters of terrestrial security.

807
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.803
not space.

808
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.413
Madam President.

809
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.530
Let's plan to meet when
you get back to Washington.

810
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.570
I'm sure I'll have an update for you then.

811
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.403
- Very good. General.

812
00:46:24.403 --> 00:46:26.130
- Of course. all my best at the G7.

813
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.090
This invasion by the
Russian's not good.

814
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.040
Hard to believe they were once an ally.

815
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.163
Major?

816
00:46:42.163 --> 00:46:42.996
- Yes. sir.

817
00:46:42.996 --> 00:46:44.240
- I'll see you at the briefing.

818
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.073
- Yes sir.

819
00:46:46.001 --> 00:46:47.882
- Madam President.

820
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.390
- Major. I'd like to have that file.

821
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:20.540
- Yes. Madam President.

822
00:47:25.189 --> 00:47:26.356
- And the USB?

823
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.840
- Madam President. I
don't think I could...

824
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.377
Of course. Madam President.

825
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.373
- How many of us have
dreamed of this moment?

826
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.860
The moment when we learned
that we're not alone?

827
00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:51.620
And what's the first step that we take?

828
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.543
A military one.

829
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.973
History will record the
day I signed this order.

830
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.260
My God. what have I done?

831
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.130
- You've done what is
necessary for the moment

832
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.820
because something tells me the alternative

833
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.900
may have been far worse.

834
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.840
While I don't agree with it.
I understand your decision.

835
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.700
History is replete with moments like this.

836
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.760
but moments are never the whole picture

837
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.060
that is yet to be painted.

838
00:48:20.663 --> 00:48:23.560
- I wish I could share your
spirited optimism. Cedric.

839
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.433
- Optimism is what we
must have. Madam President

840
00:48:26.433 --> 00:48:28.883
so the darkest hour turns
into the brightest day.

841
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:34.140
- Madam President. it was a
pleasure to meet you today.

842
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.800
I'm sorry the circumstances.

843
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.140
- Think nothing of it. Major.

844
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.320
These are revealing times.
if not conflicted ones.

845
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.600
- May I ask which base you
might be visiting next?

846
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.770
- You may ask.

847
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.100
- Major. may I ask where you're headed?

848
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.630
I could use a ride to the field.

849
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.657
- Mr. Griffin was your ride. I gather.

850
00:48:50.657 --> 00:48:51.960
- Yes. I could hire a car. but-

851
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.320
- No. no. that'd be fine.

852
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.890
I'm not due back at Chievres
until later this afternoon.

853
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.550
I'd be happy to do it.

854
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:02.943
- Thank you. Madam President.
until our next meeting.

855
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.273
- Safe travels. Cedric.

856
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.610
- Madam President.

857
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:09.443
- Elisabeth.

858
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.513
- Ma'am.

859
00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:39.010
- With the stroke of a pen.

860
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.763
I just unleashed hell on Earth.

861
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.810
- Where am I taking you?

862
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.060
- It's a private field about
10 kilometers from the city.

863
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.416
I'll direct you.

864
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:02.666
- If you have the address I can GPS it.

865
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.603
- Why did you sign it?

866
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.050
- We needed to know
who we're dealing with.

867
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.820
Since the knowledge of an
alien presence on Earth

868
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.020
was conveyed to me by my predecessor.

869
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.400
on the day after I assumed office.

870
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.100
my fear has always been
that at some point.

871
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.440
the military would rest
control of our armed forces

872
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.540
from civilian command.

873
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.500
It's easier to monitor
him if I agree with him.

874
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:35.500
If I fight him. he'll burrow
into a hole so deep and black.

875
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.070
not even Kepler could
find him .

876
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.913
Issue the code. Argonaut Two.

877
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.223
Argonaut. he's not here.

878
00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.563
- Yes. he is. Contact his embassy.

879
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.320
- Yes. Yes. Madam President.

880
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.403
- Elisabeth. everyone's been identified.

881
00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.140
take every precaution.

882
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:23.430
- Senator Hadrian

883
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.230
- I'm sure you've had enough
formalities for one day.

884
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.157
Paul will do.

885
00:55:28.157 --> 00:55:30.070
- And so will this.

886
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.510
- Excellent.

887
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.230
- Anything on Yonah?

888
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:34.580
- No. nothing.

889
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.200
There are no records on a
Cedric Yonah in any civilian

890
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.560
or military database.

891
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.220
- What? He's a science attache for Colton.

892
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.980
- Hmm. No. he isn't.

893
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.080
Our intel can't decide

894
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.920
if he was invited by Seward or Griffin.

895
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.830
- And what about him? Griffin?

896
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.390
He checks out so far.
but if he was in Germany.

897
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.890
he didn't go through Brussels.

898
00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:55.990
- How did he leave?

899
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:59.730
- Helicopter. no flight plan
and even more disturbing.

900
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.900
we've lost him on the radar.

901
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.720
- That's not possible in this airspace.

902
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.963
- Someone made it possible just like this.

903
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.233
- What the hell?

904
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:13.953
- They're all like this from the meeting.

905
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:18.480
But if you take a look at
your drive. they're all fine.

906
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.900
That camera we hid in your fruit salad

907
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.750
seemed to work wonderfully.

908
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.250
And we picked up your
signal as you came topside.

909
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.270
It's not mechanical.

910
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.270
- No. And I'm afraid

911
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.800
Sampson is gonna have the same results.

912
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.140
By the way. we haven't heard from her

913
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.490
since she went down
underneath for the meeting.

914
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:37.000
Has she reported back to you?

915
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.890
- That's disturbing.

916
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:43.220
I disabled the Faraday
shield after I left.

917
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.780
Click back to the meeting.

918
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.440
No. something's not right.

919
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.033
No background. no picture.

920
00:56:53.905 --> 00:56:55.260
You don't think you could
be one of the people?

921
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.253
- Who knows?

922
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:01.500
- Well. whoever he is. he knows who I am.

923
00:57:03.184 --> 00:57:05.178
- But we know who he works with.

924
00:57:05.178 --> 00:57:07.528
And this meeting was
always about intelligence.

925
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.133
- Yes.

926
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.840
- Madam President. the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom

927
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.877
and the President of
the Russian Federation.

928
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:15.480
- Alison. thank you so much.

929
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.810
- Well. I was just upstairs. but...

930
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:20.053
- Sergei. I appreciate this.

931
00:58:20.053 --> 00:58:21.453
You know I wouldn't have called
Argonaut Two if it wasn't-

932
00:58:21.453 --> 00:58:22.513
- Elisabeth briefed us.

933
00:58:22.513 --> 00:58:23.500
- Stephen. where is Elisabeth?

934
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.480
- She's in communication
with the Synedrion Council.

935
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.722
- Let us know when she returns. Thank you.

936
00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:30.222
- Madam President.

937
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.693
- Allison. there's coffee. tea.

938
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:53.292
- You didn't push the panic
button because of a satellite

939
00:58:53.292 --> 00:58:54.811
we already knew about.

940
00:58:54.811 --> 00:58:55.997
Your military is out of control.

941
00:58:55.997 --> 00:58:59.520
- And yours isn't? You
invaded and annexed Crimea.

942
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.180
- Crimea's parliament
voted for independence.

943
00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.030
- Oh. please. After you installed
a pro Russian government.

944
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:05.561
- Your sanctions against us will not be-

945
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:08.833
- Sergei. Helen. We're not here

946
00:59:08.833 --> 00:59:10.383
to talk about matters of state.

947
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.100
- You're right?

948
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.103
Of course. My apologies.

949
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.053
- Well. now that we have detente.

950
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.930
Helen. Argonaut Two is only called

951
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:49.940
when one of the space is
an imminent outside threat.

952
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.124
but this isn't outside it's inside.

953
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.590
- I had no idea you were
such a historian on space.

954
01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:02.460
Elisabeth.

955
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.863
- That's why I'm here. I briefed her.

956
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.670
- Well. one thing was quite clear.

957
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.943
Seward and Yonah are not
casual acquaintances.

958
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.083
I wonder. have we been played?

959
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.930
- In what sense?

960
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.320
- There are only two possibilities.

961
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.693
Either they made a mistake. which I doubt.

962
01:00:26.807 --> 01:00:28.240
Or they deliberately sent a signal

963
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.233
through Milstar to smoke us out.

964
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.710
I don't think it was the former.

965
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.720
- Why would they possibly do that?

966
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.720
- Answers. The crash in
47. The conference in 72.

967
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.400
He mentioned reverse engineering

968
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.050
and seemed to go off a
cliff when I told him

969
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:47.150
we decoded the signal.

970
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.200
We've been waiting for a move.

971
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.620
This could have been it.

972
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.373
- No. I don't see it.

973
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:57.020
Would you have given the
Taliban classified intel

974
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.710
to disclosed their exact locations?

975
01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:02.193
No. Misinformation. of course.

976
01:01:03.353 --> 01:01:05.520
And you remember the day
the signal was cracked

977
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.830
and you took the information.
clarified it with our records.

978
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.143
You nearly had a stroke.

979
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.250
And the method we use
to crack that signal.

980
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.450
the Geneva Convention
doesn't apply to them.

981
01:01:19.214 --> 01:01:20.047
- Them!

982
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.260
- Does he know about Apollo?

983
01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:32.620
- This invasion by
the Russians. not good.

984
01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.570
Hard to believe they were once an ally.

985
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.993
- Helen. this is bigger than Apollo.

986
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.033
It transcends all of us.

987
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:48.813
- Jesus Christ.

988
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.570
- And he's not working alone.

989
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.410
- What was her reaction?

990
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.243
- Dejected.

991
01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.540
- And insurgency?

992
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.640
- I suspect in all our militaries.

993
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.860
that's why I called Argonaut Two.

994
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.930
Like the first during the war

995
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.223
the only way to win this
one is if we cooperate.

996
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.060
- Reager gives a whole new
meaning to fifth column.

997
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.050
- What about Hadrian?

998
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:21.103
Is he part of this insurgency
or just an unwilling pawn?

999
01:02:22.818 --> 01:02:24.000
- It's hard to say at this point.

1000
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.990
His committee has oversight
over the military.

1001
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:29.420
So it makes sense that he's
in communication with him.

1002
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.280
And there's also a
rumor that he's going to

1003
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.370
be Anderson's VP pick in the
next presidential election.

1004
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:35.953
- Then we should keep him close.

1005
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.420
- Telling Colton about Apollo
was the right thing to do.

1006
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.217
She can't do anything about this publicly.

1007
01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:44.703
but we can privately.

1008
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.370
This is about parity.

1009
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.980
The playing field needs to be leveled.

1010
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.570
There's a whole fleet of them.

1011
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.653
Look on the S.A. My gosh.

1012
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.792
They're all going against the wind.

1013
01:02:57.792 --> 01:02:59.953
The wind is 120 knots to the west.

1014
01:02:59.953 --> 01:03:02.073
- That was as close as we ever got.

1015
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.790
- Nothing the air force has
can compete with any of these.

1016
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:08.590
We need to get at least one of them.

1017
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.270
What's the update with our prototype?

1018
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.193
- In about 36 to 48 months.

1019
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.160
What if she shows up?

1020
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.580
We can't deny the
Commander-in-Chief access.

1021
01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.740
If she learns what we've diverted funding

1022
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.800
from NASA's Orion program for.

1023
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.940
- That's why you went in with Troy

1024
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.493
to make this diversion legal.

1025
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.720
Besides. too many of Sampson's group

1026
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.640
already know about the signal.

1027
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.090
We had to tell the president.

1028
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.970
- The meeting with Reager was never about

1029
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.440
discovering the satellite.

1030
01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.320
but who would surface
from within the military.

1031
01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.010
That was their plan.

1032
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.823
Since 72. they've been
desperate for intelligence.

1033
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.950
Can't say I blame them.

1034
01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.090
But today both sides lost
because all of the key players

1035
01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:56.693
have been revealed to each other.

1036
01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.113
If anyone was a pawn. it was me.

1037
01:04:01.342 --> 01:04:02.992
- And Cedric came to the meeting?

1038
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.683
He hasn't been seen in
public since the war.

1039
01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:09.190
- He insisted.

1040
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:10.320
we tried to reason with him.

1041
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.100
but there was no changing his mind.

1042
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.439
Reager only heard and
saw what he wanted too.

1043
01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:17.540
- There's no choice then.

1044
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.418
We need to give the peace.

1045
01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:22.028
At any cost because the next war

1046
01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:23.628
could throw us to the dark ages.

1047
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.093
- Then we need a grand
alliance and a united front.

1048
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.750
- If Colton shows up. she'll
need to make a choice.

1049
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.170
either this world or theirs

1050
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.360
because until we know the extent
this alien force has on us.

1051
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.060
there's only one thing left to do.

1052
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:16.880
- Put me through to Space Command

1053
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.343
at Peterson Air Force Base.

1054
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.890
This is General Reager.

1055
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.823
by authorization of the
President of the United States.

1056
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.190
initiate Operation Troy.

1057
01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.300
- Reager's got everyone on the offensive.

1058
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.210
So we need to keep all
eyes looking down at Earth

1059
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.110
rather than above.

1060
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:12.844
- Conflicts.

1061
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.610
- Yes and regional wars
that we can contain

1062
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.770
through back channels like this one.

1063
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.860
And then while that
front is moving forward.

1064
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.830
we can start gathering
intelligence on Reager's operation.

1065
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.580
- Follow the money.

1066
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.413
- Exactly.

1067
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.910
The Pentagon's Advanced
Aviation Threat Identification

1068
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.800
Program ran out of money in 2012.

1069
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.043
So he can't hide behind that.

1070
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:38.810
And he's probably already
tapped what he feels.

1071
01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:40.890
the CBO and treasury won't discover

1072
01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:42.240
along with black ops money.

1073
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.940
But now he needs money for
something else. something big.

1074
01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.270
I can feel it.

1075
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.390
And it's not the sat networks.

1076
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:51.540
they're already up and running.

1077
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.990
- Well. while the money is being traced

1078
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:58.500
there's plenty of hotspots
to ignite regional conflicts.

1079
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.540
We have to decide-

1080
01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.393
let's
hit pause for a moment.

1081
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:10.057
Before we start playing God.

1082
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.270
don't you think the time has come

1083
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.163
that they reveal themselves?

1084
01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.243
- They tried that. Alison in 72.

1085
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.720
I agree with Reager on one point.

1086
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.010
we all know that despite
the yearning of the masses.

1087
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:26.720
wanting to know that they're
not alone in this universe.

1088
01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.263
they actually prefer it that way.

1089
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.830
Look. I don't like this
job any more than you do.

1090
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:32.240
but no prime minister or president

1091
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.480
should be saddled with this knowledge.

1092
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.993
Nevermind. responsibility.

1093
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.593
That is the hand we've
been dealt. and thank God.

1094
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:43.220
So we're here playing cards
in this cosmic game of poker.

1095
01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.270
I'll aim for a Royal.

1096
01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.923
- And let's be clear Allison.

1097
01:07:48.923 --> 01:07:50.780
This is not about playing God.

1098
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.506
it is about delaying revelation.

1099
01:07:53.506 --> 01:07:55.090
Reager thinks he knows his enemy.

1100
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.950
but his enemy is not who he thinks it is.

1101
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.313
He's acting conventionally.

1102
01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.700
And if it's true that like-minded people.

1103
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:06.165
in our respective military
and intelligence operations

1104
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.330
have been compromised
and are following him.

1105
01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:10.660
then the only thing left for us to do

1106
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.413
is to make their job on Earth
as difficult as possible.

1107
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:19.450
We of all nations should know
that peace is not bloodness.

1108
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:22.573
The last thing any of us
need is a united insurgency.

1109
01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:27.383
To quote one of your predecessors.

1110
01:08:27.383 --> 01:08:30.020
"There is no time for ease and comfort.

1111
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.327
It is time to dare and endure."

1112
01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.880
- Sergei. I think we can all agree

1113
01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.020
that nothing about this
is easy or comforting.

1114
01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.150
but when the day comes that we
no longer question ourselves.

1115
01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:47.234
we become the very people
we're trying to defeat.

1116
01:08:47.234 --> 01:08:50.098
Let us hope we endure this.

1117
01:09:13.956 --> 01:09:15.805
- I understand.

1118
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.573
Sampson left with Cedric 15 minutes ago.

1119
01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:26.950
and there's a radar and
communications blackout

1120
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:30.293
that radiates out 15
kilometers from the city.

1121
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.153
- Griffin disappears. Cedric
can't be identified. no comms.

1122
01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:39.958
This can't be a coincidence.

1123
01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.530
Put me through to Commander Halsey.

1124
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:02.150
- You should continue
pushing into Donbass.

1125
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:04.760
- What about the Security
Council and NATO?

1126
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.510
- Three of the five permanent
members are in this room.

1127
01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:14.173
Ukraine is not part of NATO
so article five doesn't apply.

1128
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.223
Germany will complain.

1129
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.680
but their economy relies
on your good graces

1130
01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.853
so it will go nowhere.

1131
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:28.510
Maybe superficial sanctions.
but that's as far as it will go

1132
01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:32.890
- Coalition airstrikes against ISIL

1133
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:34.290
will be starting next month.

1134
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.690
With our intelligence. we
can assist ISIL's reach

1135
01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:41.040
outside of their caliphate.

1136
01:10:42.715 --> 01:10:47.620
- Dear God. Helen. Do you
know what you're saying?

1137
01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.520
If this gets out-

1138
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.190
- Allison. if you have a
pious solution for this.

1139
01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:52.093
we're all ears.

1140
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.550
Arresting Reager and
Hadrian is not an option.

1141
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.723
First. there's no legal basis for it.

1142
01:10:57.723 --> 01:10:59.330
I mean. dismissing Reager
would be one thing.

1143
01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.593
but removing a sitting Senator?

1144
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.890
And let's be clear.

1145
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.940
if cornered their option
could lead to a conflict

1146
01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:07.940
of biblical proportions.

1147
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:08.773
You know that.

1148
01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.670
Just like everyone else in this game.

1149
01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.093
we need intelligence.

1150
01:11:14.963 --> 01:11:17.430
Not just for them. but for ourselves.

1151
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.923
Because when this dam breaks.

1152
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.800
we better know who's on our ark.

1153
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.613
Debate's over

1154
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.880
- Well. as for debate. you
knew there's growing voice

1155
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.333
in the UK to leave the European Union.

1156
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.290
If the vote is to leave. it
will send the markets in turmoil

1157
01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:50.053
and destabilize the European economy.

1158
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.480
But we can't force people to
vote one way or the other.

1159
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.980
- Elections can be influenced.

1160
01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:00.010
Depending on the outcome.

1161
01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.720
we could keep intelligence agencies

1162
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.473
and governments busy for years.

1163
01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.390
The question you need to ask yourself

1164
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.750
is who do you want to
occupy the oval office

1165
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.857
after you leave.

1166
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.650
Who do you think is best equipped

1167
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:15.563
to handle matters of space?

1168
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.600
This is where we keep our friends close.

1169
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.092
but our enemies closer.

1170
01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.290
- Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

1171
01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:02.760
The council has known for some
time that there is one hangar

1172
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.410
that central can not see through.

1173
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.780
As General Reager has been identified

1174
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:11.070
as part of this military insurgency

1175
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:15.660
and with his frequent trips to
the base. the time has come.

1176
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.713
where we need to know
what's inside that hanger.

1177
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:20.683
A bit of history.

1178
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:23.380
During the Cold War. Wright was home

1179
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.100
to the Aeronautical System Center

1180
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.240
and the National Air and
Space Intelligence Center.

1181
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.770
If there was a new aerospace
weapon or intelligence system

1182
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:34.270
it was conceived. designed. tested.

1183
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:36.163
and deployed from Wright.

1184
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:40.883
but it was World War II
that brought it home to us.

1185
01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.100
just after the war. Operation
Paperclip landed 200 plus

1186
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.800
Nazi German scientists
and technicians at Wright.

1187
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.460
The most famous of them
was Wernher von Braun.

1188
01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.420
whose Saturn V rockets.
landed men on the moon in 1969

1189
01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.410
and resulted in the greatest cover-up

1190
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:01.883
in Earth's known history.

1191
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.180
- Does the council have any
idea what's in that hangar?

1192
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.023
- None. And security is biometric.

1193
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:15.930
- Well. the answer is simple.

1194
01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.120
Wright is your the next base inspection.

1195
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.483
- As Commander-in-Chief. you're
the only one that can go.

1196
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.503
- Well. there may be
another. but time is short.

1197
01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:36.283
If I do this. we lay every.
every card on the table.

1198
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.430
I think we should wait.

1199
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:41.030
- What for?

1200
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:43.700
You need to take the same lead with Reager

1201
01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.900
as you just did with us.

1202
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:37.890
- Glad you knew how to get here.

1203
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.123
It's weird that GPS didn't work.

1204
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.470
That was a long call you had.
I hate teleconference calls.

1205
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:54.040
especially when you just have to listen

1206
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.733
while someone else drones on.

1207
01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.120
- Just because I was listening

1208
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.303
doesn't mean I wasn't saying anything.

1209
01:16:08.194 --> 01:16:10.440
It looks like
your ride's not here yet.

1210
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.640
Do you need to call someone?

1211
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.473
Nope.

1212
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.500
So tell me Ellen. you've
been in the military what?

1213
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.030
Since high school?

1214
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:21.500
- Just about.

1215
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.000
- What brought you to the
air force. specifically?

1216
01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:27.450
- Well. ever since I was a kid.

1217
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.500
I wanted to know how to fly.

1218
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.270
At first. it was just
the remote control planes

1219
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:32.876
and then before I knew it.

1220
01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:35.200
I was learning to fly a
Cessna while in high school.

1221
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.907
My father showed me.

1222
01:16:36.907 --> 01:16:38.910
- He was a pilot? Your
parents must be proud.

1223
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:41.220
- Yes. Commercial. He is.

1224
01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.470
Mom?

1225
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:43.843
- She died when I was 10.

1226
01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.040
- Sorry.

1227
01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.113
- Oh. thank you. It's all right.

1228
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:51.463
So it was just my dad. me.

1229
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:53.930
I used to love when he would sneak me

1230
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:55.083
on to the flight deck.

1231
01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.120
- Flying is rather intoxicating. isn't it?

1232
01:16:59.120 --> 01:16:59.953
- Oh. yes.

1233
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.343
- Doing some work on the F-35?

1234
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.470
- Not as much as I would like.

1235
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:08.413
program is a development nightmare.

1236
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:10.763
- So I hear.

1237
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.860
So then you got a degree
in aerospace engineering.

1238
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.320
- Yes. How did you know?

1239
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.360
- Just an educated guess
with your satellite work.

1240
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.940
Any other reasons why
you joined the military?

1241
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.492
Forgive my asking.

1242
01:17:24.492 --> 01:17:26.733
I always find the stories interesting.

1243
01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:30.820
- I guess a sense of adventure.

1244
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.203
seeing new things. traveling.

1245
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:35.293
What about you?

1246
01:17:35.293 --> 01:17:38.450
What made you so passionate
about science and history?

1247
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.107
That was quite the speech
you gave to General Reager.

1248
01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.660
- Well. when you've been
at it as long as I've been.

1249
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.083
let's just say it's a
long experience. long.

1250
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:51.610
But for me it's how science
transcends the past.

1251
01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:53.140
present and future.

1252
01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.300
I've always been curious. I
guess. wanting to contribute.

1253
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.730
wanting to understand the unknown.

1254
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:00.723
something my parents instilled in me.

1255
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.210
They taught me to understand
that once you know the unknown.

1256
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:07.163
it no longer frightens you
because you can learn from it.

1257
01:18:08.169 --> 01:18:10.907
But learning is three-dimensional
not two like Reager.

1258
01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:13.750
- You don't like him.

1259
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:16.160
- It's nothing to do with
like. but it's everything to do

1260
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.580
with the fact that he came to that meeting

1261
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.603
for one reason only. to get a signature.

1262
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.010
- He's always been objective-driven.

1263
01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:26.130
He didn't rise to the rank he
has without being decisive.

1264
01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:28.510
- True. We all have our objectives.

1265
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:30.610
Speaking of. you and your group

1266
01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:33.754
must've been pretty excited
when you made this discovery.

1267
01:18:33.754 --> 01:18:37.457
- Oh. it was incredible

1268
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.703
to know that we're not alone.

1269
01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:48.703
but I'll admit it. I'm scared.

1270
01:18:51.955 --> 01:18:55.960
Maybe. Maybe I just don't
understand this unknown.

1271
01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.300
- Yet. You see what was exciting to me

1272
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.720
was the fact that some
civilization found Earth

1273
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.490
worthy to look at. to study.

1274
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.240
Kepler may already be looking back.

1275
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:08.960
but there's a technology gap

1276
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.410
and so many don't understand
what they can't see.

1277
01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:15.520
Someday direct imaging from
Earth will be possible.

1278
01:19:16.393 --> 01:19:17.993
- I hope I'm around to see that.

1279
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.210
- Unlike Reager. at least you want to see.

1280
01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:24.651
So how long have you worked with him?

1281
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:27.560
- Of and on about 10 years? Why?

1282
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.563
- Do you trust him?

1283
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.270
- That's quite a question
coming from a civilian.

1284
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:34.270
It's not a matter of trust.

1285
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.880
It's about following the chain of command

1286
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.050
- And respecting that chain?

1287
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.893
- Absolutely.

1288
01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:42.350
- I can imagine then you're conflicted

1289
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:45.707
because you're still wondering
how he decoded the signal.

1290
01:19:45.707 --> 01:19:47.860
What did Reager mean when he said.

1291
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.693
- With everything we know.

1292
01:19:48.693 --> 01:19:51.240
we should have seen this one coming?

1293
01:19:53.273 --> 01:19:55.680
- How the hell did you hear that?

1294
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.820
You were across the room?

1295
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.513
- It doesn't matter. what
does is what he meant.

1296
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.240
- Cedric. I've enjoyed our talk.

1297
01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.550
but I am not disclosing
classified information.

1298
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.240
I think you can wait for your ride alone.

1299
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.730
- Information that in addition
to anti-gravity propulsion.

1300
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:13.430
the satellite had stealth technology

1301
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:16.700
and in fact. disappeared
right in front of the X-37.

1302
01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.420
You remember what I told him?

1303
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.650
How long the satellite has been in orbit?

1304
01:20:22.659 --> 01:20:24.860
It could be one year. it could be 100.

1305
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.010
It could be a thousand.

1306
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.480
- Neither one of you have any idea.

1307
01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.480
and it's been the subject
of numerous conversations.

1308
01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.863
There is something we both
know that Reager doesn't.

1309
01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.380
You're sure it wasn't Earth-based signal

1310
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.680
that reflected off some
piece of space debris?

1311
01:20:43.325 --> 01:20:46.694
When I asked you that you turned
ashen white. just like now.

1312
01:20:46.694 --> 01:20:49.110
It was that moment when
you and I made a connection.

1313
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.700
Simply you lied to Reager either

1314
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.500
because you didn't
understand what you detected

1315
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.100
or didn't want to understand it.

1316
01:20:55.352 --> 01:20:56.840
If the signal originated
on earth from say.

1317
01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.920
a radio telescope. that would
have been a different story.

1318
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.490
The transmission originated
in the atmosphere

1319
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.260
to the satellite at LG2 through Milstar.

1320
01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.090
and back to its origin.

1321
01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:08.440
- How do you know all this?

1322
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:10.740
- Because I sent it

1323
01:21:13.721 --> 01:21:15.820
You know. as well as I
that signals intelligence

1324
01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.630
didn't decrypt the transmission.

1325
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:19.270
Your civilian self probably wanted to know

1326
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:21.190
how decryption was possible.

1327
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:24.440
but your military training told
you to just follow command.

1328
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.930
but something. something told you

1329
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:29.203
to report the origin of
the signal differently.

1330
01:21:30.878 --> 01:21:35.140
"With everything we
know." what did he mean?

1331
01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.677
- I could go to jail for this.

1332
01:21:37.677 --> 01:21:39.870
- You're already in a jail of conflict.

1333
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:41.420
an untenable command structure.

1334
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:47.120
- It's not that I didn't
want to understand.

1335
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.513
I didn't want him to.

1336
01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.703
He's beyond obsessed with
anti-gravity propulsion.

1337
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:56.150
He brought me and some
others in several years ago

1338
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:58.280
to go through everything
we had on the subject.

1339
01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.650
from Project Sign. Grudge and Blue Book

1340
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.470
to black opps aerospace programs.

1341
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.850
He even once showed us a video

1342
01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:11.510
of something flying at a
headwind of over 120 knots.

1343
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.003
I say something because
it's still unidentified.

1344
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.080
All of us were caught up in it.

1345
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:20.590
- How far did you get?

1346
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:24.700
- Theoretically. we made
some solid progress.

1347
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:26.440
When he had his transfer everything we had

1348
01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.990
to a working group at Wright-Patterson.

1349
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:30.890
we were led to believe it was
to benefit the F-35 program.

1350
01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:34.620
We heard nothing for months.

1351
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.180
then this signal brought us
all back to General Reager.

1352
01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.710
- Compartmentalize.

1353
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:41.740
One group does one thing.
another does something else.

1354
01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.520
but only a handful. know everything.

1355
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.043
Classic military structure.

1356
01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.340
- I've been honest with you Cedric.

1357
01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.970
Now you need to be honest with me.

1358
01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:53.393
How did you send this signal?

1359
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.610
- How is a matter of science.

1360
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:58.140
But make no mistake.

1361
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.430
there's no coincidence that
your group received a signal.

1362
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:02.360
We knew you were monitoring

1363
01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.657
that particular Milstar satellite.

1364
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:08.363
- Oh my God.

1365
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.450
You worked for General Reager. don't you?

1366
01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.033
This was all about
intelligence. wasn't it?

1367
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:20.220
We've been hearing about security sweeps.

1368
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.360
surprise base inspections.
national security.

1369
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.153
Oh my God. What have I gotten into?

1370
01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:34.030
- Ellen. I don't work for Reager.

1371
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:35.710
but yes. this is about intelligence.

1372
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.653
We need your help.

1373
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.333
- My help?

1374
01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:40.723
Wait. we?

1375
01:23:42.201 --> 01:23:45.833
- In your line of work. do
the years. 1947 in 1972.

1376
01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:47.267
have any meaning to you?

1377
01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:57.360
- '47 was operation Blue Nose.

1378
01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.960
And while that ridiculous Roswell story

1379
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.360
and '72 was when the Apollo program ended.

1380
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.410
- Do you know why it ended?

1381
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:09.632
- Everyone knows that. to
develop the space shuttle.

1382
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:16.370
What the...

1383
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:23.083
There's someone at the end of the field.

1384
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.961
- I know.

1385
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.630
My involvement in all this
started before the war.

1386
01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.483
- Iraq?

1387
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:34.483
- World War II.

1388
01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.420
There was a justifiable concern
that after two millennia.

1389
01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.260
your technology wasn't progressing fast enough.

1390
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.120
If something happened to
ours. for whatever reason.

1391
01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.830
there was no backstop.

1392
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:49.630
How did Sagan say it.
"In all this vastness.

1393
01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:51.590
there was no hint that help
will come from elsewhere

1394
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:53.067
to save us from ourselves."

1395
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:58.980
So a decision was made to advance
certain fields of science.

1396
01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:01.090
I was sent to the Peenemunde
Army Research Center

1397
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:02.607
in Germany.

1398
01:25:02.607 --> 01:25:05.350
It was truly the Cape Kennedy of its day.

1399
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:07.800
Under the guise of a visiting scientist.

1400
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.400
I offered assistance here and there.

1401
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.983
particularly in areas of
propulsion and guidance.

1402
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.370
Well. I got caught up in my work

1403
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:16.370
and showed them things I shouldn't have.

1404
01:25:17.242 --> 01:25:19.180
When I refused to cooperate further.

1405
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.663
I was arrested and sent
to a concentration camp.

1406
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:25.250
You can imagine my disgust

1407
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:28.090
when Reager was talking
about identification.

1408
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:29.940
not from my people. but the millions.

1409
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:32.830
The millions that never went home.

1410
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.990
Well. after the camp was liberated.

1411
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:41.683
I found myself alone in the
field. just waiting to go home.

1412
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:45.960
The German scientists were
repatriated to the United States

1413
01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.853
and continued their work or
should I say some of my work.

1414
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.360
There was no choice. but to monitor

1415
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.560
all military installations
for developments.

1416
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:58.150
A couple of years after the war
a patrol went down in Roswell.

1417
01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:01.270
for more reasons than I can count.

1418
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:03.840
It was impossible to retrieve
certain remains of the crew

1419
01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.800
and the aircraft's propulsion
and stealth technologies.

1420
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.900
We had high hopes during the 1960s though.

1421
01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:12.910
Perhaps the seeds of
science planted in war

1422
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:14.160
would come back in peace.

1423
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:18.370
When first contact was
finally made in 1969.

1424
01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:21.010
everything seemed to be
progressing the way we wanted.

1425
01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:22.640
Oh. there were concerns
in various governments

1426
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.190
to say nothing of the military.

1427
01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.950
but Synedrion Council
felt they had to proceed.

1428
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.070
that living in the shadows
was no longer an option.

1429
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:33.120
In 1972. they agreed to meet with your

1430
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.440
United Nations security council

1431
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.090
to pave the way for revelation
that mankind is not alone.

1432
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:40.440
First contact. if you will.

1433
01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.280
The military escort never
brought them to that meeting.

1434
01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.230
We've been looking for them ever since.

1435
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:49.170
You can only imagine my guilt.

1436
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.460
It didn't matter what our
involvement was in your world

1437
01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.370
or our technology.

1438
01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:54.680
We couldn't find them.

1439
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:58.290
It was Griffin's idea for the signal.

1440
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:00.033
We had to know who would surface.

1441
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:03.330
Signal was too tempting for Reager.

1442
01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:05.870
He knew there was only one
group that could decrypt it.

1443
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:06.960
- Group?

1444
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.783
- Our parents. the ones
your military kidnapped.

1445
01:27:11.756 --> 01:27:14.393
Oh. come on. Seriously?

1446
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.230
You don't honestly expect me
to believe any of this. do you?

1447
01:27:20.556 --> 01:27:23.272
- I only expect you to
believe what you can see?

1448
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:35.947
- Governor. you asked for this?

1449
01:27:35.947 --> 01:27:36.947
- Thank you.

1450
01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.410
- Good to see you again. Major.

1451
01:27:40.625 --> 01:27:42.096
- Where there any problems?

1452
01:27:42.096 --> 01:27:44.706
- Aside from the curator? None.

1453
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:49.460
- I'm not laughing. What did he call you?

1454
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:50.540
- Governor.

1455
01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.533
- Governor of what?

1456
01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:54.360
- You haven't told her?

1457
01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.883
- Nearly everything. but.

1458
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.140
- Major. Cedric Yonah. is the
Governor of Dominion Earth

1459
01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.477
and Premier of the Synedrion Council.

1460
01:28:03.764 --> 01:28:05.910
- I thought you said it was
your parents on this council

1461
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:06.800
or whatever.

1462
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.510
- They were. We ascended
after they disappeared.

1463
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:13.140
James let's keep an open
comm for transparency.

1464
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:15.042
Was there anything else?

1465
01:28:15.042 --> 01:28:16.490
- During your conference with the council.

1466
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:17.750
Central monitored Reager's calls

1467
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:20.410
from Chievres Air Base to Patterson AFB.

1468
01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:23.550
on his order GPS and Sat comm Directorate.

1469
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:25.210
Echelon and the Deep Space Network

1470
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:27.360
received new detection programming.

1471
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.380
To avoid intercept. Central
has rerouted all comm traffic

1472
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.663
to the secondary grid.

1473
01:28:32.762 --> 01:28:34.263
- That should buy us some time.

1474
01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:39.110
- Reager also inquired about
your whereabouts Major Sampson.

1475
01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:42.830
Now civilian agencies and
military installations

1476
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:44.460
in the region are on
high alert over a radar

1477
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.360
and communications blackout.

1478
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.800
The United States and United Kingdom's

1479
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.930
are claiming it's Russian
retaliation over the G7.

1480
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.820
The Belgian authorities claim
it's a terrorist attack.

1481
01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.100
NATO has elevated its
alert readiness to Amber.

1482
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.033
And F-16s have been
scrambled from Melsbroek AB.

1483
01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:03.300
Central will hold the
blackout until our departure.

1484
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.450
- My God. How do you know all this?

1485
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.503
- Why? X-ray communications. Major.

1486
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.683
- Keep your eye on Cedric.

1487
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:22.381
- That's not hard sir.
He's keeping them on me.

1488
01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:25.631
- If an opportunity
presents itself. take it.

1489
01:29:25.631 --> 01:29:28.214
We need to know more about him.

1490
01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:33.280
- Thank you. James.

1491
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.663
- Of course. Major. I look
forward to our next meeting.

1492
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.823
Governor.

1493
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:54.350
- There's a hanger at Wright-Patterson

1494
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:55.860
that we can't see through.

1495
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.557
That's why we need your help.

1496
01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:00.530
- What about your X-ray communications?

1497
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:05.410
- Don't mock me. I'm in no mood for it.

1498
01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:07.850
It's sheathed in the
same materials we use.

1499
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:10.233
The crash of 47. the stealth technology.

1500
01:30:11.218 --> 01:30:12.300
if you know how to manufacture it.

1501
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.983
it's easily adaptable to
structures and satellites.

1502
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:18.563
Ellen. I can't stress
this next point enough.

1503
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:21.910
I know you've heard some
fantastic stories today.

1504
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:24.760
And by the look on your face.
you don't believe any of them.

1505
01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.590
But if Reager is developing
what I think he is.

1506
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:30.680
the balance of power could
shift in such a direction

1507
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.853
that life on this planet.
as we know it. will be over.

1508
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:37.500
Think. has it ever. ever occurred to you.

1509
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.970
why the United States has
built a military complex

1510
01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:42.500
that could destroy the
world 10 times over.

1511
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.410
Please don't tell me it's
because of the Soviet Union.

1512
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:47.000
It's because they know they aren't alone.

1513
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.653
and paranoia is driving
this uncontrollable madness.

1514
01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:53.465
We need to know where our parents are

1515
01:30:53.465 --> 01:30:55.247
and what's in that hanger.

1516
01:30:55.247 --> 01:30:57.363
I confess I'm running out of patience.

1517
01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.210
but the alternative to
patience is not an option.

1518
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:04.690
I've seen war in all its
ugliness. too many times.

1519
01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:07.210
The lines of peace need to be drawn here.

1520
01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:10.952
between us. on this field. in this moment.

1521
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:16.160
You sadly deal in absolutes

1522
01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.013
because the unknown terrifies you.

1523
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:22.760
- General. if I sign this.

1524
01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.803
what's the objective of Operation Troy?

1525
01:31:26.110 --> 01:31:26.960
- Identification.

1526
01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.820
- So help me. God.

1527
01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:48.773
what you've said is either
all true or all a lie.

1528
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:56.030
All my years of training
have told me to listen.

1529
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:58.633
stay calm and to act decisively.

1530
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:03.513
But the oath I took.
isn't just a set of words.

1531
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:08.763
General Reager is one thing.
but the president is another.

1532
01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:13.683
I cannot pledge my allegiance
on just your words alone.

1533
01:32:14.676 --> 01:32:16.270
- Then you need to ask yourself.

1534
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:18.750
once you eliminate the
impossible whatever remains.

1535
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:21.100
no matter how improbable.
must be the truth.

1536
01:32:22.785 --> 01:32:24.103
- Doveryai. no proveryai.

1537
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:26.913
- Trust. but verify.

1538
01:32:28.614 --> 01:32:32.680
- This is exactly what they
want. How can you trust her?

1539
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.880
- How can I not try?

1540
01:32:39.185 --> 01:32:42.175
Can you see the forest for the trees?

1541
01:33:51.615 --> 01:33:52.698
- Oh. my God.

1542
01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.030
You told us everything in
that meeting. everything.

1543
01:34:03.583 --> 01:34:06.957
- You only hear what. not what you should.

1544
01:34:17.169 --> 01:34:18.545
You only believe what you see.

1545
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.433
This is for you.

1546
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:41.523
NASA can verify its authenticity.

1547
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:44.823
If you can help us.
Griffin is your contact.

1548
01:34:46.770 --> 01:34:47.603
- Thank you.

1549
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.787
- How old are you?

1550
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.210
- Old enough to never forget.

1551
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.700
- Why are you here?

1552
01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.533
- Answers.

1553
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.523
You honestly don't believe we're
the only ones here. do you?

1554
01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.153
- Where are you from?

1555
01:35:23.399 --> 01:35:24.232
- Earth.

1556
01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.130
- General Reager. please.

1557
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:46.730
- What is it?

1558
01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:48.843
- Sampson signal has reappeared.

1559
01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:50.963
- Where?

1560
01:37:52.145 --> 01:37:56.183
- A field. 10 kilometers from the city.

1561
01:41:48.479 --> 01:41:49.430
- Do you have any idea what he wants?

1562
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:52.850
- No. He just wanted. more like
demanded a meeting.

1563
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:55.350
- And he flew from Colorado to Brussels?

1564
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:56.700
- Well. it must be important.

1565
01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:58.733
- Bill.

1566
01:41:58.733 --> 01:41:59.617
- Yes. Madam president.

1567
01:41:59.617 --> 01:42:01.117
- I need a moment.

1568
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.090
- If Reager learns what brought
a Holocaust to your world

1569
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:09.270
you're going to have to explain to this one.

1570
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:10.160
why your people who've been here

1571
01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.360
for the last 2000 plus years.

1572
01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.420
- That's why it's imperative
we find our parents.

1573
01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:15.810
If they talked under pressure or-

1574
