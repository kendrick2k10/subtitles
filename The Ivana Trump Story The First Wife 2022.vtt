My favorite story is when Ivana
was up in Canada one time.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.370
She was selling jewelry.

11
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.270

this watch. and she said.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.230
She said. "And the dial
is mother of the pearl."

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530
"Mother of the pearl."
It was the best.

15
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.770
She always put "the"
before everything.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.470
"The Donald."

17
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.330
She was very funny.
She had a good sense of humor.

18
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.130
But she botched up
the English language

19
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.100
like you just
can´t even imagine.

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.330

most important moment

And she wasn´t doing that.

But he didn´t know Paris.
He didn´t know London.

116

He didn´t know a king

unless they tried to rent

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.370
respected her power
and her vision.

344
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.230
He could trust her.
and she worked for the company.

345
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.430
When she was working.
she was a company girl. 100%.

346
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.230
LINDA:
I think they were very similar

347
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.500
because she was
incredibly ambitious.

348
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.770
incredibly forward.
and not shy at all.

349
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.700
She promoted herself.
She promoted Donald.

350
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.430
She promoted
all their buildings.

351
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.300
She promoted like crazy.

352
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.670
- When Ivana referred
to her husband.

353
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.300
she famously called him
"The Donald."

354
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.030
-Do you really call him
"The Donald"?

355
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.400
- I really started it.
I wasn´t sure --

356
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.500
It´s my bad English. I suppose.

357
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.530
- So it´s "The Plaza."
"the apartment"...

358
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.170
- It´s -- Yes.
- "The husband." "The Donald"?

359
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.330
- Yes.
- Okay.

LINDA: She was the Kardashians
before there were Kardashians.

362
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.630
She was Kris Jenner.

363
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.070
- Ivana was the neck
that moved the head.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.230
RES: I don´t know that
he would have done as well

365
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.630
with somebody
that wasn´t as smart as she.

366
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.100
Donald was bright enough --

367
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.100
I mean. no genius --

368
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.200

than Donald.

DENNIS: They were part of

She was not part
of the nighttime scene

372
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.770
at all. ever.

373
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.500
I was a little bit
a part of that.

374
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.330
and I´d call her and say.
"Come on."

375
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.070
She says. "No. no. no.

376
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.170
I have a meeting at 8:00 a. m.
with the contractors."

379
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.770

381
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.600

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.430
Donald Jr.. Ivanka. and Eric.

383
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.500
- She just knocked out
those kids one. two. three.

384
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.600
- I love my kids. but I didn´t
want them to get in trouble.

385
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.070
I wanted the discipline
and the schedule.

386
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.770
I think you --
when you keep your kids busy.

387
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.530
you know. they have no troub--
time to get in trouble.

388
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.300
DENNIS:
She was tight. She was strict.

389
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.670
She was a European mother.
- We have an amazing mother.

390
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.370
and she held us
to a very high standard.

391
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.030
- My mother was much more
the old-school

392
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.000
Eastern European
strong disciplinarian.

393
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.470
- I grew up surrounded --
as a little girl --

394
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.500
surrounded
by strong female mentors.

395
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.230
- She didn´t want to be
your new best friend.

396
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.030
She wanted to be your mother.

397
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.530
- And I was flying at 8:00
in the morning after breakfast

398
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.730
with the kids for Atlantic City
on the helicopter.

399
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.100
I was there until 5:00. 6:00.

400
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.570
I would come back home and
to do homework with the kids.

401
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.270
have a dinner with them.
and then I would go --

402
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.230
In ´80s. I had to go
and dress up in the ball gown.

403
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.370
matching shoes.
matching handbag.

LINDA:
She must have been a good mom

406
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.370
because her kids
really love her.

407
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.170
but I don´t think
she was like what. you know --

408
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.070
"I can do at all."

409
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.070
I think she was mostly business.

410
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.230
NIKKI:
People loved Ivana.

411
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.070
and I think they were
really a great couple.

412
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.770
It´s not enough for
just one person to be fabulous

413
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.630
and the other one
to be sort of mediocre.

414
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.330
- She was as out there
as he was.

415
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.500
She was also as driven
as he was.

416
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.400
- If Ivana wasn´t involved
in his business.

417
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.170
there would have been
no business.

418
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.300
- Donald Trump
bought The Plaza Hotel

419
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.500
and then put Ivana in charge.

420
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.400
PAULA: She was the manager
of The Plaza.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.370

422
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.170
he was interviewed about that.
you know. and he made a joke.

around you. don´t they?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.600
IVANA:
I get one dollar a year.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.330
MAN: One dollar a year.
Do you have any other perks?

429
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.670
DONALD: Yes.
all the dresses she can buy.

430
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.030
and that costs me a lot
of money.

431
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.430
It´s a lousy deal I made.
That´s one of my bad deals.

432
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.030
- A dollar a year and
"all the dresses she can buy."

433
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.270
And it was such
a horrible thing to say.

434
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.400
I mean. it was just -- She was
devastated by that remark.

435
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.270
I mean. he was building her up.

436
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.000
"She ran the casino. and she´s
now gonna do The Plaza Hotel."

437
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.200
She felt very bad about that.

438
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.470
She wanted to please him.

439
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.770
and she wanted him
to respect her.

440
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.470
But I´ll tell you.
they had some kind of a party

441
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.330
for her or something.
and they were applauding her.

442
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.330
And he was like.
"Who the hell are you?"

443
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.630
It was like he wasn´t there.

444
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.070
In his face. I saw the anger.

445
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.400
"What the hell?
People are admiring her?

446
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.770
And I´m standing here?"

GEORGE: There was tension
between Donald and Ivana

448
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.100
because she was becoming
too popular

449
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.130
and getting more press
than he was.

450
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.030
Everyone fell in love
with Ivana.

451
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.600
and I think. deep down.
Donald resented it.

452
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.300
CINDY: She was the one
you went to for The Plaza.

453
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.730
She was the one if you wanted
a room in Atlantic City.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.070
She was the one for everything.

455
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.070
And she was taking
some of the excitement away.

456
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.630
He wasn´t gonna have it.

457
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.230
- What if you had said.
"Well. Donald and I are equal

458
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.000
and I feel very independent"?

459
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.500

I would have been dead!

460
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.370

as ambitious as he was

461
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.430
and almost more so.

462
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.000
But the interesting thing is
that she sold them as a couple.

463
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.530
the branding as a couple.

464
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.430
but her --
probably her big mistake

465
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.630
was to make him more famous
than she was

466
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.130

She goes.
"What are you talking about?"

I said. "Get lost.
I love my husband very much."

It was very unladylike.

00:24:34.562 --> 00:24:36.692
Donald didn´t care.
He loved all the publicity.

to Donald daily.

568
00:24:47.362 --> 00:24:49.892
Every single day.
I talked to Donald.

569
00:24:49.892 --> 00:24:54.332
She. Ivana. called Liz Smith.
who was my counterpart.

570
00:24:54.332 --> 00:24:56.362
and she told the story.

571
00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:58.562
- Every day
on the front page of the paper.

572
00:24:58.562 --> 00:25:01.592
it was. "I´ve never had sex
like this before."

- The truth.

577
00:25:09.292 --> 00:25:11.362

she had nothing to do

578
00:25:11.362 --> 00:25:13.692
with the breakup
of your marriage.

579
00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:15.432
- Wow.

580
00:25:15.432 --> 00:25:18.262
Uh. she´s the woman
in -- in Donald´s life.

581
00:25:18.262 --> 00:25:22.162
- I think that putting a wife to
work is a very dangerous thing.

582
00:25:22.162 --> 00:25:23.392
I mean. we´ll make -- we´ll do

583
00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:25.292
an educational program here.
okay?

584
00:25:25.292 --> 00:25:26.662
If you´re in business
for yourself.

585
00:25:26.662 --> 00:25:28.562
I really think it´s a bad idea

586
00:25:28.562 --> 00:25:29.792
to put your wife
working for you.

587
00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:31.632
There was a great softness
to Ivana.

588
00:25:31.632 --> 00:25:33.462
and she still has that softness.

589
00:25:33.462 --> 00:25:35.762
But during this period of time.

590
00:25:35.762 --> 00:25:38.592
she became an executive.
not a wife.

591
00:25:38.592 --> 00:25:41.362
I think that was
the single greatest cause

592
00:25:41.362 --> 00:25:45.432
of what happened
to my marriage with Ivana.

593
00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:49.332
MAN: The couple that. for many.
symbolized the ´80s

594
00:25:49.332 --> 00:25:50.762

JOHNNY CARSON:
The Trumps have hit some bumps.

596
00:25:53.592 --> 00:25:56.892

It was very nasty.

597
00:25:56.892 --> 00:25:59.462
- "Ivana Better Deal."
The best headline of ´em all!

598
00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:02.662
- She was having such problems
because of the children.

599
00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:04.532
Kids at school
were telling the kids.

600
00:26:04.532 --> 00:26:06.532
"Oh. I hear your parents
are getting divorced

601
00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:08.532
and your father´s
cheating on your mother."

602
00:26:08.532 --> 00:26:11.532
Her main concern
was not subjecting them

603
00:26:11.532 --> 00:26:14.862

604
00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:17.192
NANCY: The women
were on Ivana´s side.

605
00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:20.262

were on Donald´s side.

606
00:26:20.262 --> 00:26:22.292
They wished
they could pull that off.

607
00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:26.362
So everybody had a stake
in this drama.

608
00:26:26.362 --> 00:26:29.332
Donald wanted to make Marla
acceptable.

609
00:26:29.332 --> 00:26:31.262
not known as a home wrecker.

610
00:26:31.262 --> 00:26:34.392
- He would call up and say.
"Oh. it´s getting nasty."

611
00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:36.392
and then try to promote Marla.

612
00:26:36.392 --> 00:26:39.562
All he was trying to do
was legitimatize Marla

613
00:26:39.562 --> 00:26:43.392
and make it seem like Ivana
was just a big pain in his rump.

It was pretty terrible.

615
00:26:44.932 --> 00:26:48.392

617

He´s father of my children.
and I wish him best.

618
00:26:51.492 --> 00:26:54.232
I hope that she makes him happy.
and if she does.

619
00:26:54.232 --> 00:26:57.762

I really want for him.

Marla Maples wanted
to make amends with you.

625
00:27:09.832 --> 00:27:13.632

in -- in London

626
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:15.862
if I would accept her apology.

627
00:27:15.862 --> 00:27:19.532
I said. "Apology
is absolutely not accepted."

628
00:27:19.532 --> 00:27:21.292
I never accept her apology.

629
00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:23.762
She ruined my family
and my marriage.

630
00:27:23.762 --> 00:27:25.892
I just call her the show girl.
That´s all.

631
00:27:25.892 --> 00:27:28.192
- And yet you accepted
Donald´s apology.

632
00:27:28.192 --> 00:27:30.492
Why accept Donald´s apology
and not hers?

633
00:27:30.492 --> 00:27:32.532
- Because he was father
of my three children.

634
00:27:32.532 --> 00:27:35.492
Very good provider.
So this is why.

635

- How do you forgive
something like that?

636
00:27:36.892 --> 00:27:39.292
It´s not just that
he cheated on her.

637

He was worldwide!

638
00:27:40.832 --> 00:27:44.592
She was shamed all over

plus $600.000 a year

646

for raising the three children.

647
00:28:07.792 --> 00:28:10.762
- That was seen very good
at the time by most people.

648
00:28:10.762 --> 00:28:13.732
I thought she got a pittance
of what she could have gotten.

649
00:28:13.732 --> 00:28:17.592
- She got the settlement and she
got that house in Connecticut.

650
00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:19.262
She flipped it. and. you know.

651
00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:23.392
immediately doubled her alimony.

Did Donald want the marriage

653

I have to separate"?

654
00:28:29.192 --> 00:28:32.632
- Um. it really was my decision.

655
00:28:32.632 --> 00:28:36.332
Um. I tried for two months.
as you know. until February.

656
00:28:36.332 --> 00:28:39.832
I tried to live with the idea
that I´ve been cheated on

657
00:28:39.832 --> 00:28:41.562
and I´ve been lied to.

658

I would not take him back

00:37:18.192 --> 00:37:20.362
That interview with Ivana Trump.

853
00:37:20.362 --> 00:37:23.862
at the very least.
I can describe it as memorable.

854
00:37:23.862 --> 00:37:26.432
- Sprechen sie Deutsch?
- No. Nein.

855
00:37:26.432 --> 00:37:27.862
- No?
- No. [ laughs ]

856
00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:30.892
One of the most interesting.

857
00:37:30.892 --> 00:37:33.692
fascinating interviews
I´ve ever done.

858
00:37:33.692 --> 00:37:37.362
She was direct.
She was confident.

859
00:37:37.362 --> 00:37:40.232
You knew that she was
somebody not to mess with.

860
00:37:40.232 --> 00:37:43.562
GWENDA: She had been part of
the really early on

861
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:45.892
creation and image building
of Donald Trump

862
00:37:45.892 --> 00:37:48.732
that would ultimately lead
to the presidency.

863
00:37:48.732 --> 00:37:51.762
- He never would have been
on "The Apprentice"

864
00:37:51.762 --> 00:37:54.762
without the image
that she created.

865
00:37:54.762 --> 00:37:57.332
- You´re fired.
- And he never would

866
00:37:57.332 --> 00:37:59.732
have been president
without "The Apprentice."

867
00:37:59.732 --> 00:38:02.632
- She created so much
of that Trump brand.

868
00:38:02.632 --> 00:38:04.732
I don´t think
she ever got the credit.

869
00:38:04.732 --> 00:38:08.262
- There were suggestions
from the start.

870
00:38:08.262 --> 00:38:11.632
from. you know.
starting in mid-´80s.

871
00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:13.532
of hints of presidency.

872
00:38:13.532 --> 00:38:16.362
but it wasn´t really
a serious suggestion.

873
00:38:16.362 --> 00:38:19.732
- In New York. building
after building bears his name.

874
00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:21.732
He gets more publicity
these days

875
00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:23.632
than almost any movie star.

876
00:38:23.632 --> 00:38:26.362
And some people think
he should be president.

877
00:38:26.362 --> 00:38:29.362
- None of us really thought that
Donald was gonna be president.

878
00:38:29.362 --> 00:38:31.662
You know. um.
I don´t think Donald thought

879
00:38:31.662 --> 00:38:32.932
he was gonna be president.

NIKKI:
I think she was very proud

884
00:38:42.192 --> 00:38:46.232
of him becoming President
of the United States

885
00:38:46.232 --> 00:38:48.862
´cause it was something
he always wanted.

886
00:38:48.862 --> 00:38:51.732
I remember
when they first got married.

887
00:38:51.732 --> 00:38:54.232
he made Ivana become
an American citizen

888
00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:56.192
because he wanted
to be president.

889
00:38:56.192 --> 00:38:57.892
GWENDA: Many years later.
that´s what happened.

890
00:38:57.892 --> 00:39:00.492
but when he did finally get
to the White House.

891
00:39:00.492 --> 00:39:05.292
I always felt like she was kind
of in the shadows in some way.

892
00:39:05.292 --> 00:39:06.892
- How often do you two talk?

893
00:39:06.892 --> 00:39:08.762
- Talk about once in 14 days.

894
00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:10.392
- That´s pretty remarkable.

895
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:13.832
- She also said something about.
"Well. I think

896
00:39:13.832 --> 00:39:16.192
that Melania
must be jealous of me."

897
00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:18.592
which drove Melania insane!

898
00:39:18.592 --> 00:39:20.792
- I had the direct number
to the White House.

899
00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.732
but I not really
want to call him there

900
00:39:22.732 --> 00:39:25.492
because Melania is there
and I don´t want to cause

901
00:39:25.492 --> 00:39:27.562
any kind of jealousy
or something like that

902
00:39:27.562 --> 00:39:30.662
because I´m basically
first Trump wife. okay?

903
00:39:30.662 --> 00:39:34.232
[ laughs ]
I´m first lady. okay?

904
00:39:34.232 --> 00:39:36.562
- I don´t think she ever made
a slip of the tongue.

905
00:39:36.562 --> 00:39:39.762
She was much too savvy
to go on national television

906
00:39:39.762 --> 00:39:42.262
and say. "I´m the first
first lady. Oops!"

907
00:39:42.262 --> 00:39:44.392
- I´m pretty sure
it was a little dig.

908
00:39:44.392 --> 00:39:45.832
NIKKI:
It was definitely a dig.

909
00:39:45.832 --> 00:39:48.232
I was actually there
when she said it.

910
00:39:48.232 --> 00:39:49.892
And. of course.
it resonated around the world.

911
00:39:49.892 --> 00:39:52.632
Everybody picked up
on that in one second.

912
00:39:52.632 --> 00:39:54.762

the mantra of the story.

00:40:06.862 --> 00:40:09.292
- I don´t think
she ever said anything

916
00:40:09.292 --> 00:40:12.532
that was not calculated
for a response.

AMY: And she realized
that Donald Trump´s presidency

918
00:40:15.432 --> 00:40:17.262
created a lot of adversaries.

919
00:40:17.262 --> 00:40:21.562

Hadn´t seen her in a few weeks.

that she was going
to Saint-Tropez.

961
00:42:10.662 --> 00:42:13.932
You know. Ivana
was completely locked down

for being the former wife...

1022
00:44:57.162 --> 00:45:00.692
of the past President
of the United States...

1023
00:45:00.692 --> 00:45:06.232
and the true glamour queen
of the ´80s and ´90s.

1024
00:45:08.332 --> 00:45:13.232
But. really. how I know
she wants to be remembered --

1025
00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:15.762
as a devoted mother.

1026
00:45:15.762 --> 00:45:17.432
IVANA:
Discipline and confidence.

1027
00:45:17.432 --> 00:45:20.662
I set myself certain goals.
certain commitments.

1028
00:45:20.662 --> 00:45:22.832
You know. courage.

1029
00:45:22.832 --> 00:45:25.192
The guts. plain. simple guts.

1030
00:45:25.192 --> 00:45:26.592
you know.
to go down that mountain.

1031
00:45:26.592 --> 00:45:28.332
or -- or go and come out of

1032
00:45:28.332 --> 00:45:30.432
the communistic country
with nothing.

1033
00:45:30.432 --> 00:45:34.832
- Her love. her irreverent
attitude towards things.

1034
00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.892
and the fact that
she was always overdressed

1035
00:45:36.892 --> 00:45:40.162
and looking gorgeous
really made it work.

1036
00:45:42.162 --> 00:45:44.462
DENNIS: You know. honey.
where the hell did you go?!

1037
00:45:44.462 --> 00:45:48.892
It´s. like. a little bit
annoying. You left us too early.

1038
00:45:48.892 --> 00:45:50.762
IVANA:
I´m not competing with the man.

1039
00:45:50.762 --> 00:45:53.562
No. I´m competing with myself.
But you have to try your best.

1040
00:45:53.562 --> 00:45:57.592
That´s all what you can do
at any given moment.
