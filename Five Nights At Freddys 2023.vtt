I don't know. it's nice that

727
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:39.210
we can finally agree
about something.

728
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.005
(softly):
Are you gonna give me away?

729
00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:44.299
- Abs. no. I...
- (knocking at door)

730
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:50.472
Hey. Vanessa.

731
00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:52.140
Hey. Mike.

732
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.017
And hello.

733
00:48:54.017 --> 00:48:56.686
Vanessa. this is Abby.
Abby. Vanessa.

734
00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:59.189
Hi. Abby.

735
00:48:59.189 --> 00:49:01.649
Mike didn't tell me
he had a daughter.

736
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:03.568
- Gross.
- No. uh. Abby's my sister.

737
00:49:03.568 --> 00:49:06.905
Ah. Well. he didn't tell me
he had a sister either.

738
00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:09.449
Are you here to arrest Mike?

739
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:11.701
MIKE: Okay. uh. can you
go play in your room

740
00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:13.745
so me and Vanessa can talk?

741
00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:15.163
It's nice to meet you.

742
00:49:16.998 --> 00:49:20.126
What. um...
what are you doing here?

743
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:22.962
- Somebody broke into Freddy's.
- What?

744
00:49:22.962 --> 00:49:24.881
Wh-What-what happened?

745
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.258
Recognize these?

746
00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:30.345
Look. it's not
what you think. okay?

747
00:49:30.345 --> 00:49:32.305
Th-Those are--
They're sleeping pills.

748
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:34.015
- They help me sleep.
- I know what they are. Mike.

749
00:49:34.015 --> 00:49:35.350
It's written on the bottle.

750
00:49:36.685 --> 00:49:38.645
News flash:
If you're too whacked out

751
00:49:38.645 --> 00:49:40.188
to remember to lock
a friggin' door.

752
00:49:40.188 --> 00:49:42.399
accident or not. you're liable.

753
00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:44.234
It's called
criminal negligence.

754
00:49:44.234 --> 00:49:46.653
(scoffs)
You wouldn't understand.

755
00:49:46.653 --> 00:49:48.196
Well. then help me.

756
00:49:48.196 --> 00:49:50.240
'Cause the moment
I file that report.

757
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.034
it's out of my hands.

758
00:49:57.038 --> 00:49:59.374
You want to take a walk?

759
00:50:03.044 --> 00:50:05.755
So I used to have a brother.

760
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.051
His name was Garrett.

761
00:50:11.386 --> 00:50:13.847
(sighs) And when I was...

762
00:50:13.847 --> 00:50:16.349
about 12.

763
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.768
he was. uh. he was taken.

764
00:50:20.145 --> 00:50:22.480
And I was there
when it happened.

765
00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:26.026
They never found
the guy who did it.

766
00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:27.652
and they never found
my brother.

767
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:36.995
So there's this theory that.
uh. we can't forget things.

768
00:50:36.995 --> 00:50:39.998
Basically. it says that
every single thing that you see

769
00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:42.792
in your entire life.
down to the tiniest of details.

770
00:50:42.792 --> 00:50:44.711
gets stored inside of you.

771
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:48.048
You just have to know
how to look.

772
00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:50.216
Your brother--

773
00:50:50.216 --> 00:50:52.344
you think you saw who took him?

774
00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:54.346
I know I did.

775
00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:56.848
And I know that he's in here.
but he's just-- he's--

776
00:50:56.848 --> 00:50:58.058
It's buried.

777
00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.060
So every night. I dream.

778
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.478
and I go back
to that same memory.

779
00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:03.730
and I-I search for details.

780
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:06.649
For any little thing
that got overlooked.

781
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:14.032
Yeah.

782
00:51:14.032 --> 00:51:16.576
And that's usually the part
where people tell me I'm crazy.

783
00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:20.789
I know what crazy
looks like. Mike.

784
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:22.749
This isn't it.

785
00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:24.793
Not even close.

786
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:28.338
And these?

787
00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:30.715
I mean. going back
to the same dream.

788
00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:32.425
the same place
night after night.

789
00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:35.095
it's not easy.
so the-the pills help.

790
00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:36.346
Some other things.

791
00:51:36.346 --> 00:51:38.264
like familiar sights.
familiar sounds.

792
00:51:38.264 --> 00:51:39.933
"Pining for fun?"

793
00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:41.476
(chuckles)

794
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:43.895
-"Visit Nebraska."
- (laughs)

795
00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:46.481
Your sister seems cool.

796
00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:49.025
So it's just the two of you?

797
00:51:49.025 --> 00:51:50.902
Yeah.

798
00:51:50.902 --> 00:51:53.446
Yeah. it's just us.

799
00:51:53.446 --> 00:51:56.616
Our mom died
a little while back.

800
00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:01.329
And Dad.
he couldn't handle it. so...

801
00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:04.582
You know what's crazy is. uh.

802
00:52:04.582 --> 00:52:06.626
when... when Garrett and I
were kids.

803
00:52:06.626 --> 00:52:09.295
they were like
those perfect parents

804
00:52:09.295 --> 00:52:11.339
you'd see on old TV shows.

805
00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:16.302
Yeah. ev-every night.
we would sit down together.

806
00:52:16.302 --> 00:52:17.846
we'd have family dinner.

807
00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:20.640
and we'd hold hands
and say grace. and...

808
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.393
That actually sounds
really nice.

809
00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:28.356
Yeah. at the time.
I thought it was really cheesy.

810
00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:32.944
But then it's gone.

811
00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:40.952
You and Abby.
you still have each other.

812
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:45.623
From where I sit.
I'd say you're lucky.

813
00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:50.503
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

814
00:52:50.503 --> 00:52:52.839
(sighs) I should go.

815
00:52:56.968 --> 00:52:59.471
No more sleeping on the job.

816
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:02.349
When you're at Freddy's.
you stay alert.

825

and you will sleep.
and under no circumstances

826
00:53:33.588 --> 00:53:34.923
are you gonna come out
of my office.

827
00:53:34.923 --> 00:53:36.800

- I understand.

828

You're not here to have fun.
