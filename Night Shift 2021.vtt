00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.339
(people arguing)

5
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.172
(crowd laughing)

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.470
(dramatic music)

8
00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.949
- If you look up the definition
of death in a dictionary.

9
00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.449
it says the act of dying. the end of life.

10
00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.069
the total and permanent cessation

11
00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.033
of all the vital functions of an organism.

12
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.398
Sounds pretty basic. right?

13
00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:53.029
Kind of like something
else. say like wind.

14
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:57.768
Yeah. the definition of
wind: air in natural motion.

15
00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:59.476
as that is moving horizontally

16
00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.779
at any velocity along the earth's surface.

17
00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:05.931
Just another explanation. right?

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.149
Funny thing is. when it's
windy. it's windy everywhere.

19
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.880
You have to go indoors to
escape it or in your car.

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.589
in your house. behind a
wall. or maybe even a tree.

21
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:22.756
You could say death is
like wind. it's everywhere.

22
00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:25.645
It's everywhere we go.

23
00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:29.779
It's in everything we
eat and what we drink.

24
00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:32.389
It's where our older
generations have gone.

25
00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.972
and it's where everyone we
know is going. including us.

26
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.619
Normally. you don't even think about it.

27
00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.619
I mean. not really. Not until
someone close to you dies.

28
00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.079
That's when you realize that
death isn't like wind at all.

29
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.171
You can't hide from it in
your house. in your car.

30
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:58.504
behind a wall. not anywhere.

31
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.663
Wind comes and wind goes.
but death. it's like gravity.

32
00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.067
It truly is everywhere.

33
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.899
It's constant and it's always final.

34
00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:16.099
and if someone you know dies.
it's like. holy fucking shit.

35
00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.571
That person doesn't even exist anymore.

36
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:23.314
Like. what the actual fuck?
It doesn't make sense.

37
00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:26.160
No one even seems to know
how to deal with life.

38
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.493
let alone death.

39
00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:30.749
This story is about how me and my brother.

40
00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.332
Bobby. try to deal with both.

41
00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:37.133
(lighter clicking)

42
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:57.401
(door handle clicking)

43
00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.292
- We're already in.

44
00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.239

45
00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.563
(lighter clicking)

46
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.368
Don't worry about it. man.

47
00:03:42.368 --> 00:03:44.677
Women. all the same.

48
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.808
- It's not like that. We had plans.

49
00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:54.766
- Yeah. and I bet Todd
Miller wasn't in your plans.

50
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.291
Just got to forget about it. man.

51
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.040
You can't go back in the past.

52
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.555
I mean. what could you do anyway?

53
00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:10.555
What's gonna happen is gonna
to happen. So you know what?

54
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.038
- What?
- Gotta let it happen.

55
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:18.018
- I don't know. man.

56
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.771
- Wait here a minute.

57
00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:37.632
(Bobby coughs)

58
00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:38.851
All right. check this out.

60
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.842
- Ready?
- Mm.

63
00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:55.766
- Fucking awesome.

64
00:04:58.987 --> 00:04:59.820
Yes!

65

(thud)
(car siren blaring)

69
00:05:17.438 --> 00:05:19.688
- I never liked her anyway.

70
00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.589
Mom didn't like her either.

71
00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.522
- Yeah. she didn't.

72
00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:40.945
- Check this out.

73
00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:53.398
- Fuck off.
- Fucking hit it. you pussy.

74
00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:57.118
- This is how you take a girl
for a ride. baby. Woo hoo hoo!

76
00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.418
Oh. fucking come on. Hit it. man!

77
00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:03.001

I can't open it! It's on a time lock!

107
00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:51.594
Don't kill me!

108
00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:53.604

(feet tap)
(man whines)

110
00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:00.002
What the fuck are you
doing? I said stop it.

111
00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:03.465
- I can't help it! I do
this when I'm scared!

112
00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.654
- Look. look. okay. I'm not
going to kill you. all right.

113
00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:08.374
But I might if you don't stop doing

114
00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:11.622
whatever the fuck it is that you're doing!

115
00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:15.294
- Please don't kill me! I want to travel!

116
00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.294
I want a pet poodle.

117
00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:20.061
- Hey. hey. hey! Calm down!

118
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.373
- Look. we're not going to hurt
you. We just want the money.

119
00:08:22.373 --> 00:08:24.233
- Yeah. we're not gonna
hurt you! We want the money!

120
00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:26.233
- Jesus! See. it's okay.

121
00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.782
He just likes the point that at people.

122
00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:33.473
Look. man. let me talk to

00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:35.353
- Yeah. well he fuckin' oughta be scared!

124
00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:38.103
- Shut up! Go and watch the door!

125
00:08:39.506 --> 00:08:41.839
- Fine! Fucking talk to him!

126
00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:47.173
- See. that's better. isn't it. Amy?

127
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:54.641
- No. it's Amiey. not Amy.
Do I look like a girl?

128
00:08:54.864 --> 00:08:57.197
- No and sorry. Amiey. yeah.

129
00:08:58.568 --> 00:09:00.452
I just want to have a little chat.

130
00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:03.168
- Look. I already told you. you can't get

131
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.888
into the safe it's on a time lock.

132
00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:07.941
If you try and open it.
it'll call the police.

133
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:09.541
It's got an alarm!

134
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.094
- Okay. So what do you do when you finish?

135
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:13.994
What about when you pack your till?

136
00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:16.881
- I already told you. Don't you listen?

137
00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:20.065
It is a time lock. It opens
at 6:30 in the morning.

138
00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:22.565
That's at the end of my shift.

139
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.897
- Okay. Don't you move?

140
00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:42.015
You heard him. bro. We got to go.

141
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.515
- For fuck's sake!

142
00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:47.687
Desy?

143
00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:50.644
- [Des] What if someone comes?

144
00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:52.061
- You keep watch.

145
00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:56.083
(duck alarm quacks)
(rock music)

146
00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:56.916
- Shit!

147
00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:15.457
- What the fuck. idiot?

148
00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:18.593
- Sorry. man. I didn't see you coming.

149
00:10:18.593 --> 00:10:21.767
(paper rustles)

150
00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.267
- This is for you!

151
00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:29.322
(motorcycle engine roars)

152
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.003
- Fuck!

153
00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:46.331
(foot tapping)
(country music)

154
00:10:53.981 --> 00:10:55.743
- You're late again!

155
00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:57.193
- I'm sorry. Chaz. I got held up.

156
00:10:57.193 --> 00:10:58.330
- It's not Chaz!

157
00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.707
It's Mr. Stevens to you

158
00:10:59.707 --> 00:11:02.368
and I really don't care what
your excuse is this time

159
00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:04.630
because it's not going to happen again.

160
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.130
Do you understand?

161
00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:08.517
Des?

162
00:11:08.517 --> 00:11:10.100
- Yes. Mr. Stevens.

163
00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:24.303
(keys jingle)

164
00:11:24.303 --> 00:11:26.187
Hang on a minute.

165
00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:27.727
Have you ever had one of those moments

166
00:11:27.727 --> 00:11:32.727
in life where time seems to
slow down or maybe even stop?

167
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.837
Maybe something happens.

168
00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:36.342
Maybe you meet somebody

169
00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:40.524
and everything suddenly
seems crystal clear.

170
00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:43.180
A moment you'll never forget.
(speaks indistinctly)

171
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.097
Well. this is one of those moments.

172
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.403
- Huh?

173
00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:49.903
- Bit of a douche.

174
00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:52.276
Your manager.

175
00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:56.276
- Oh. yeah. totally. Oh.
his dad owns the store.

176
00:11:57.513 --> 00:12:00.180
- One cappuccino and two lattes.

177
00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:03.538
- Small. medium or large?

178
00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:04.578
- All large.

179
00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:06.578
- Okay. coming right up.

180
00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:08.458
- Okay.

181
00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:12.343
(liquid sprays)

182
00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:16.400
(coffee spills)

183
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.798
My dress!

184
00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:20.235
- Oh. I am so sorry.

185
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.885
- What's going on here?

186
00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:23.718
- I was just-

187
00:12:23.718 --> 00:12:26.796
- It's my fault. I picked it
up by the lid and it just fell.

188
00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:31.318
- I see. Des. why didn't
you put the lid on properly?

189
00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:34.735
What do I always tell you about the lids?

190
00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:40.237
(door squeaks)

191
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:52.391
- Is that you? You wanna get some food?

192
00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:57.558
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

193
00:12:57.558 --> 00:13:00.225
- We got a formal demand letter.

194
00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:16.231
- This is bullshit!

195
00:13:19.835 --> 00:13:22.507
Well don't worry. man. I'm
going to get a job soon.

196
00:13:22.507 --> 00:13:23.907
And then with both of us working.

197
00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:25.490
- I just got fired.

198
00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:40.770
- You watch! Give me your shirt!

199
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.143
- What. my shirt?

200
00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:43.727
- Now take it off.

201
00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:48.711
- Okay. okay. You're not
going to rape me are you?

202
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.129
- What?

203
00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:53.293
- I heard about this guy.

204
00:13:53.293 --> 00:13:56.393
- Shut up! I'm not going to rape you.

205
00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:57.226
Fuck!

206
00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:02.507
Think I wanna hear your life story?

207
00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:03.684
- I was just saying.

208
00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:06.484
- I'll tell you your life story.

209
00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.651
You get born in curry land

210
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.759
and you bring your fucking yapping.

211
00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:15.133
curry-munching head over here

212
00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:18.637
and take all our jobs in all the servos

213
00:14:18.637 --> 00:14:22.347
until one day you get
your head blown off by me

214
00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:25.197
'cause you won't shut up!

215
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.530
- Bobby. what the fuck. man?

216
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:32.774
- You want to work in a service station?

217
00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:33.837
- Do you want to look like I want

218
00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:36.087
to work in a fucking servo?

219
00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:40.110
- What the fuck are you doing?

220
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.082
- We're takin' over. bro.

221
00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:42.488
- Are you crazy?

222
00:14:42.488 --> 00:14:44.672
- Don't worry. man. I
got this under control.

223
00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:47.749
It's like 12:45. It's six hours.

224
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:49.365
I can do this shit.

225
00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:51.456
- We should just go!

226
00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.314
- [Bobby] We got a customer!

227
00:14:53.314 --> 00:14:54.942
- Oh. for fuck's sake!

228
00:14:54.942 --> 00:14:59.692
- Just act completely normal
and everything will be fine.

229
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.574
(sensor beeps)

230
00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:04.407
What the hell is that?

231
00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:07.165
- You got to press the button!

232
00:15:07.165 --> 00:15:07.998
- What?

233
00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:10.870
- The one that lets her buy fuel. idiot!

234
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.037
- Where is it?

235
00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:16.426
(alarm blares)

236
00:15:16.426 --> 00:15:17.831
- What did you do?

237
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:19.794
- I hit the button!

238
00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:24.044
- Are you fucking retarded?
It says emergency only!

239
00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:27.690
- What the hell?

240
00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:31.473
- Uh. excuse me.

241
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:35.019
Yeah. we're just having some
technical difficulties in here.

242
00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:35.912
Could you please just go back

243
00:15:35.912 --> 00:15:37.912
to your car and fill up?

244
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.082
(alarm stops)
(Bobby laughs)

245
00:15:47.082 --> 00:15:48.869
- That was close.(over mic)

246
00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:50.499
I mean. do you think she
realized that we're actually-

247
00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:51.416
- Oh. shit!

248
00:16:06.243 --> 00:16:07.076
- Six.

249
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.077
- Six?

250
00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:11.738
- Yeah.

251
00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.369
- What?

252
00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:15.409
- Number six. the fuel?

253
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:18.299
- Uh. how much was it?

254
00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:21.398
- Um. you're supposed to tell me that.

255
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:24.870
- Oh. yeah. Um. let's see.

256
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.329
- Number six.

257
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:27.737
- Yeah?

258
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:28.820
Um. it's. um.

259
00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:32.313

260
00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:33.387

- You're kidding?

268
00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:49.926
- What are you doing. idiot?

269
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.995

270
00:16:51.995 --> 00:16:54.526

271
00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:56.417

273
00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:00.486
What are you doing?

274
00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.457
- Quick. grab her legs!

275
00:17:02.457 --> 00:17:07.415
(woman groans)

276
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:16.141
- Get your fucking grubby
hands off me you fucking shits!

277
00:17:18.278 --> 00:17:19.582
- What are you doing?

278
00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:21.382
I'm the night manager here.

279
00:17:21.382 --> 00:17:22.830
You can't treat customers like this.

280
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.571
I'm not going to let you rape me or her.

281
00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:26.404
- Rape?
- Yeah!

282
00:17:26.404 --> 00:17:30.237
- We're not going to
rape you for fuck's sake!

283
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:34.969
- What the hell were you
going and grabbing her for?

284
00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:37.640
- Uh. are you fucking retarded?
She knew something was up.

285
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.622
- How could you possibly know that?

286
00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:42.867
- Uh. well. "Congratulations!
You win free fuel!"

287
00:17:42.867 --> 00:17:44.040
I mean. what the was that?

288
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.407
- Fucking whatever.
she didn't have a clue.

289
00:17:47.407 --> 00:17:50.619
- Didn't have a clue? You're fucked!

290
00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:52.227
- What are you doing?

291
00:17:52.227 --> 00:17:54.822
- Okay. Did you know something was up?

292
00:17:54.822 --> 00:17:55.655
- What?

293
00:17:55.655 --> 00:17:57.999
- Did you think something
was up with us two?

294
00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:00.195
Be honest. not going to hurt ya.

295
00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:01.350
- I guess there was something strange

296
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.571
about getting free fuel but-

297
00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:04.171
- See! I fucking knew it!

298
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.088
I told you!

299
00:18:06.582 --> 00:18:07.415
- [Amiey] You're definitely not

300
00:18:07.415 --> 00:18:10.915
getting your fuel discount Mr. Bossypants!

301
00:18:13.302 --> 00:18:16.170
- What the fuck. man? Why you
always trying to be right?

302
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.640
- She knew something was up.
What was I supposed to do?

303
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.142
Let her go?

304
00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:21.651
- Well. fuck!

305
00:18:21.651 --> 00:18:23.302
You're the one that said
he could do the till

306
00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:24.931
so fucking go and work it out.

307
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:26.710
- [Shannon] Let me out of here!

308
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.460
(duct tape rips)

309
00:18:34.702 --> 00:18:36.582
- Grab her keys and move her car.

310
00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.160
- What?

311
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.670
- Really?

312
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.503
- Where?

313
00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:42.253
- Take it round back.

314
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.920
You want it. too?

315
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.211
- No. sir. I'm fine.

316
00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.342
- [Bobby] Hey. if we're going to do this.

317
00:18:50.342 --> 00:18:52.520
you got to listen to me.

318
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.440
- Listen to you?

319
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.210
Bobby. we're robbing a fucking servo

320
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.287
in the middle of the night!

321
00:18:57.287 --> 00:18:58.378
(Bobby clears throat)

322
00:18:58.378 --> 00:18:59.399
(register rings)

323
00:18:59.399 --> 00:19:01.399
- Will that be all. sir?

324
00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:05.279
- You're supposed to ask that
before you open the till.

325
00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:07.529
- Ah. you know what I mean?

326
00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:12.166
(cat yowls)

327
00:19:28.829 --> 00:19:30.989
- Anything else guys?

328
00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:32.159
(clears throat)

329
00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:35.492
- And a packet of Peter Winfield's. too.

330
00:19:38.937 --> 00:19:41.687
- You want twenties or 25s. mate?

331
00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:43.653
- Um. what?

332
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:48.276
- Twenties or 25s?

333
00:19:50.047 --> 00:19:53.080
- Um. 25s.

334
00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:57.327
- We need a lighter too.

335
00:19:57.327 --> 00:19:59.744
- Oh. and a lighter. as well.

336
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.447
(register beeps)

337
00:20:03.447 --> 00:20:05.030
- It's 36:50. boys!

338
00:20:05.887 --> 00:20:08.637
(register rings)

339
00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:12.132
- Thanks!

340
00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:23.517
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?

341
00:20:23.517 --> 00:20:25.887
What if they tell the parents
where they go that from?

342
00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:29.720
- Did we ever tell mom
where we got them from?

343
00:20:38.117 --> 00:20:39.967
God I miss her!

344
00:20:44.246 --> 00:20:46.637
Grab us an energy drink.

345
00:20:46.637 --> 00:20:50.507
Hey. we're to be here all night.
We might as well enjoy it.

346
00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:52.068
(Des sighs)

347
00:20:52.068 --> 00:20:54.485
(rock music)

348
00:20:58.681 --> 00:21:01.598
(motorcycles roar)

349
00:21:22.137 --> 00:21:25.468
- Well. will you look at this?

350
00:21:25.468 --> 00:21:26.301
Scotty?

351
00:21:42.543 --> 00:21:45.126
- What you want to do. Ray? Huh?

352
00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:53.942
- Let's do fucking everything. man!

353
00:21:59.997 --> 00:22:02.997
(motorcycles roars)

354
00:22:10.052 --> 00:22:12.719
(breaks squeal)

355
00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:20.099
(upbeat rock music)

356
00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:32.988
- Better double it up. Sally.

357
00:22:38.016 --> 00:22:40.259
- Better make it triple more. Sally.

358
00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.259
- Oh. you little fucker!

359
00:22:43.443 --> 00:22:44.276
- Hey!

- Sorry. babe. Some fuckheads ran into me.

382
00:24:17.978 --> 00:24:19.938
and made me spill the
drinks on my way over.

383
00:24:19.938 --> 00:24:22.138

388
00:24:55.218 --> 00:24:56.439

00:24:59.338 --> 00:25:01.509
Get the fuck off me!

00:25:01.509 --> 00:25:03.297
- Ray. look at what you're doing. mate!

392
00:25:03.297 --> 00:25:04.982
You gotta go before the cops get here.

393

(indistinct chatters)

394
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.769
Bobby. you don't want
to fuck with these boys.

395
00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:16.890
He's Ray Blackwood.

396
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.861
- What?
- Fucking Ray Blackwood!

397
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:20.957
- President of the Red Belly Blacks!

398
00:25:20.957 --> 00:25:22.129
I suggest you lay low. bro.

399
00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:23.919
- Ray the shrimp belly.

400
00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:26.002
- Mate. I fucking told you.

401
00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:30.302
- Okay. all right. Thanks. Tom.

402
00:25:33.067 --> 00:25:34.400
- You guys okay?

403
00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:37.577
- Wow! Thanks?

404
00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:41.487
Those guys make my skin
crawl! Are you okay?

405
00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:42.320
- Yeah.

406
00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:44.816
I'm Des.

407
00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:48.510
- Jessie.

408
00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:53.842
(cars whip)

409
00:25:57.719 --> 00:26:00.444
- Oh. man! Stacey is a fox!

410
00:26:00.444 --> 00:26:02.519
Wouldn't mind being warmed by her thighs.

411
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:03.352
- Yeah?

412
00:26:03.352 --> 00:26:04.617
- Let's get some food.

413
00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:06.175
- All right. I gotta get some cash here.

414
00:26:06.175 --> 00:26:09.096
- Speaking of cash. hey Billy boy.

415
00:26:09.096 --> 00:26:10.596
- Fuck!
- Aw. shit!

416
00:26:16.724 --> 00:26:18.964
- Get off! Ah. come on!

417
00:26:18.964 --> 00:26:21.466
- Hey. Brandy. Where you running to?

418
00:26:21.466 --> 00:26:22.299
- Nowhere!

419
00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:25.599
- So. where's the 150 you owe me?

420
00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:26.748
- I still don't have it!

421
00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:29.331
Get the fuck off. man! Come on!

422
00:26:30.692 --> 00:26:31.966
- When you gonna pay me back?

423
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:35.075
- You better get off. man!
I'm in the Snakes now!

424
00:26:35.075 --> 00:26:37.067
You don't want any trouble do you.

425
00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:40.896
- Oh. you're so fucking cool!
Hey. bro. check him out!

426
00:26:40.896 --> 00:26:43.417
He's in the Snakes. Aren't you. Brandy?

427
00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:44.347
You little shit!

428
00:26:44.347 --> 00:26:46.296
- Oh. come on. Let us go!

429
00:26:46.296 --> 00:26:50.006
Look man. I'm gonna get
you your money like I said.

430
00:26:50.006 --> 00:26:54.166
I'm with the Snakes now. I'll
have your money by next week.

431
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:56.154
- Next week? How you gonna do that?

432
00:26:56.154 --> 00:26:58.535
- Man. I'm in the snakes!

433
00:26:58.535 --> 00:27:00.105
- So what they got you doing?

434
00:27:00.105 --> 00:27:01.688
- Nothing!

435
00:27:01.688 --> 00:27:05.805
- Nothing? It's been six months. Billy.

436
00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:09.211
- Hey!

437
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.044
(whip cracks)

438
00:27:10.044 --> 00:27:10.877
- Hey!

439
00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:13.223
- I hope you don't like your face!

440
00:27:13.223 --> 00:27:17.906
- Okay! I heard it in a club meet.

441
00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:19.464
My first Snakes meet.

442
00:27:19.464 --> 00:27:21.123
(Bobby laughs)

443
00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:23.495
- Billy Brandy the Red B Black Snake!

444
00:27:23.495 --> 00:27:25.974
- Hey! I haven't finished!

445
00:27:25.974 --> 00:27:29.154
I heard our chief talking
to the new master of arms.

446
00:27:29.154 --> 00:27:31.436
They were talking about
a job they wanted to do.

447
00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:33.966
They said they might need
some young bloods to help out.

448
00:27:33.966 --> 00:27:36.772
That's what they call
us before we're Blacks.

449
00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:38.744
I asked if I could help.

450
00:27:38.744 --> 00:27:40.295
- And?

451
00:27:40.295 --> 00:27:42.076
- When you gonna pay me back?

452
00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:44.826
- Okay. so on Thursdays they used

453
00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:49.493
to do their weekly runs
to the bank on Thursdays.

454
00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:52.276
They only do monthly runs to the bank now

455
00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:54.533
because Old Man Barnaby's such tight ass

456
00:27:54.533 --> 00:27:56.326
since that new freeway went in.

457
00:27:56.326 --> 00:27:58.287
He's been cutting back on everything.

458
00:27:58.287 --> 00:28:00.276
He's even got some sort of
curry munchers working there

459
00:28:00.276 --> 00:28:03.193
so he doesn't have to pay him jack!

460
00:28:04.786 --> 00:28:07.869
- So you want to rob a servo. Brandy?

461
00:28:09.836 --> 00:28:11.575
(Bobby laughs)

462
00:28:11.575 --> 00:28:13.124
You gotta be kidding me!

463
00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:15.826
- Rob a servo? Billy Brandy the bandit?

464
00:28:15.826 --> 00:28:19.716
- Hey. he's a snake now. man
better not tease him too much.

465
00:28:19.716 --> 00:28:21.636
- Yeah. ha. ha. ha. Laugh it up!

466
00:28:21.636 --> 00:28:23.575
I'll be the one fucking smiling

467
00:28:23.575 --> 00:28:25.898
when I'm a fucking high-roller.

468
00:28:25.898 --> 00:28:27.636
Buy a fucking island and live on.

469
00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:29.817
won't be nothing but tequila and bitches.

470
00:28:29.817 --> 00:28:32.207
- Right. so you're going
to be able to buy an island

471
00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:34.832
with the money you get from a Servo job?

472
00:28:34.832 --> 00:28:36.759
You really are dumb as fuck!

473
00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:40.067
- No way! I heard there's
450 G's in that safe!

474
00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:41.738
- Oh. whatever. idiot!

475
00:28:41.738 --> 00:28:43.890
- Now you boys. you better let me go

476
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.988
or else I'm gonna tell
all the boys in the club.

477
00:28:46.988 --> 00:28:49.821
You don't want any trouble. do ya?

478
00:28:56.293 --> 00:28:57.588
- Oh. fuck!

479
00:28:57.588 --> 00:28:59.128
- Excuse me?

480
00:28:59.128 --> 00:29:00.639
- Mrs. Carrington?

481
00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:02.170
- Desmond Thomas?

482
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.795
Taking after that
brother of yours. are we?

483
00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:05.307
Doing a little shoplifting?

484
00:29:05.307 --> 00:29:06.140
- What?

485
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.005
No. I'm just-

486
00:29:07.005 --> 00:29:08.787
- Oh. be a good boy and reach
me a liter of that milk.

487
00:29:08.787 --> 00:29:10.757
They stack it so high!

488
00:29:10.757 --> 00:29:11.590
- Okay.

489
00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:18.986
- Thanks. dear. At least
you've still got your manners.

490
00:29:18.986 --> 00:29:23.205
- Another one? Two Thomas
boys in the one night.

491
00:29:23.205 --> 00:29:26.757
- Mrs. C. nice to see you. You're up late.

492
00:29:26.757 --> 00:29:29.896
- Yes. my dear. Just the milk.

493
00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:31.632
I see you've grown up to be a fine.

494
00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:33.208
upstanding citizen. Bobby.

495
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:34.746
A real high achiever!

496
00:29:34.746 --> 00:29:37.496
(register rings)

497
00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:40.841
Thank you.

498
00:29:43.299 --> 00:29:45.579
- What the hell is she doing
here at one in the morning?

499
00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:47.728
- How should I know?

500
00:29:47.728 --> 00:29:48.979
Getting milk.

501
00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:53.812
(woman yells)
(whooshing)

502
00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:05.708
- Hello! Welcome to Fuel Mart.

503
00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:09.147
- Yeah. pull up a chair!

504
00:30:09.147 --> 00:30:10.357
- What is going on?

505
00:30:10.357 --> 00:30:12.437
- I think they're going to rob us.

506
00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:13.437
- These two?

507
00:30:14.368 --> 00:30:15.201
- You know them?

508
00:30:15.201 --> 00:30:16.034
- They were my students

509
00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:18.636
when they were small
boys in primary school.

510
00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:22.969
- Yeah. well. it looks like
they've come a long way.

511
00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:27.827
- What the hell are we gonna do. Bobby?

512
00:30:27.827 --> 00:30:30.003
She knows who we are and
if you didn't put her

513
00:30:30.003 --> 00:30:32.627
in that fucking storeroom.
no one would have been able

514
00:30:32.627 --> 00:30:34.261
to put it together!

515
00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:36.907
Not at least until we're miles away!

516
00:30:36.907 --> 00:30:38.427
- Fucking cool it!

517
00:30:38.427 --> 00:30:40.416
I've always wanted to lock
that old bitch up anyway.

518
00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:43.465
Plus. we'll be long gone before
anyone gets out of there.

519
00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:47.005
- Long gone. long gone. long gone?

520
00:30:47.005 --> 00:30:50.245
The fucking run from the
cops. Bobby. for robbery!

521
00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:53.675
Not to mention the three
fucking people in the storeroom!

522
00:30:53.675 --> 00:30:56.522
That's fucking kidnapping as well!

523
00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:59.667
This is your grand plan to save our house?

524
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:01.250
You're a joke. man!

525
00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:04.987
Who needs a house when
you're going to prison?

526
00:31:04.987 --> 00:31:08.560
What the fuck are we going to do?

527
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.393
- We're just going to have to
clean it up then. aren't we?

528
00:31:21.517 --> 00:31:23.515
There's a mop in the storeroom.

529
00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:27.182
No point crying over spilt milk. is there?

530
00:31:31.295 --> 00:31:33.795
(door creaks)

531
00:31:38.415 --> 00:31:40.865
- You let me out of here
right now. young man!

532
00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:44.445
- Shut up! This isn't fucking school!

533
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.477
- Well!

534
00:31:45.477 --> 00:31:47.244
- Mister. I need to go to the bathroom

535
00:31:47.244 --> 00:31:48.077
and I think you should-

536
00:31:48.077 --> 00:31:50.917
- We've got a customer!
You can go after that.

537
00:31:50.917 --> 00:31:53.145
- How dare you! Let me out of here!

538
00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:56.573
- Shut up or I'll duct
tape you all together

539
00:31:56.573 --> 00:31:59.823
and there won't be any bathroom breaks!

540
00:32:15.832 --> 00:32:19.973
- You're not gonna clean up
much milk with that. Sonny.

541
00:32:19.973 --> 00:32:21.954
(Bobby laughs)

542
00:32:21.954 --> 00:32:25.121
- Oh. I told you he was a little slow.

543
00:32:27.103 --> 00:32:29.605
- It's a good thing you're doing. sonny.

544
00:32:29.605 --> 00:32:32.994
In my day. they would've locked him up.

545
00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:35.979
- Yeah. not gonna say it's been easy

546
00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:38.015
but he's family. you know?

547
00:32:38.015 --> 00:32:42.274
And if you can't trust your
family. who can you trust?

548
00:32:42.274 --> 00:32:45.725
Hey. Little Timmy. gonna need a mop. mate.

549
00:32:45.725 --> 00:32:48.892
Not a broom. a mop. you silly sausage.

550
00:33:08.855 --> 00:33:10.623
- Here you go. sonny.

551
00:33:10.623 --> 00:33:13.262
Your brother can buy you a lolly.

552
00:33:13.262 --> 00:33:16.095
when you finish your cleaning job.

553
00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:21.666
(old man blows nose)

554
00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:32.524
(door creaks)

555
00:33:35.694 --> 00:33:37.274
- Are you serious?

556
00:33:37.274 --> 00:33:39.594
You can't just go around
telling people I'm a retard.

557
00:33:39.594 --> 00:33:42.754
- Why not? I mean. you can't
clean up milk with a broom.

558
00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:45.004
Can ya. ya silly sausage?

559
00:33:46.263 --> 00:33:50.015
- So funny. aren't ya? Just
another night out on the town.

560
00:33:50.015 --> 00:33:53.074
Have you ever just once stopped
to have a look at yourself?

561
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:55.907
- Oh. come on. Des. It was a joke.

562
00:33:58.075 --> 00:33:59.158
Little Timmy.

563
00:34:00.345 --> 00:34:02.366
- You know what? This
is your fucking mess.

564
00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:03.699
You clean it up!

565
00:34:07.675 --> 00:34:09.195
(door slams)

566
00:34:09.195 --> 00:34:11.112
- I'll get you a lolly.

567
00:34:15.665 --> 00:34:18.082
(door slams)

568
00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:26.541
(Des sighs)

569
00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:49.803
- I don't want to be the first
one to talk but you really-

570
00:34:49.803 --> 00:34:51.353
- Then shut up!

571
00:34:51.353 --> 00:34:52.923
- You know that very rude?

572
00:34:52.923 --> 00:34:54.614
- Yeah. That's not very nice.

573
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:56.734
- Did I ask you to talk? Did I?

574
00:34:56.734 --> 00:35:01.067
- No. but this is our
storeroom. We were here first.

575
00:35:02.188 --> 00:35:04.523
- Yeah. you're the one
that's always coming in here.

576
00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:06.694
Why don't you just stay out there?

577
00:35:06.694 --> 00:35:10.523
- You guys are fucked.
You're our hostages.

578
00:35:10.523 --> 00:35:13.243
I'll go where the fuck I want.

579
00:35:13.243 --> 00:35:14.795
- If you think you're
going to get away with this

580
00:35:14.795 --> 00:35:16.738
you've got another thing coming.

581
00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:18.945
We are not your hostages.

582
00:35:18.945 --> 00:35:22.225
We are simply stuck in a storeroom.

583
00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:24.225
- Yes. we're stuck here.

584
00:35:25.683 --> 00:35:28.643
- You're in the storeroom
because I put you in a storeroom.

585
00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:30.972
not because you're stuck in here.

586
00:35:30.972 --> 00:35:33.163
- I refuse to be a hostage.

587
00:35:33.163 --> 00:35:37.403
I'm just slightly
inconvenienced right now.

588
00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:40.423
- Yeah. you can say that again.

589
00:35:40.423 --> 00:35:42.606
- You guys think you're not hostages?

590
00:35:42.606 --> 00:35:44.195
- No way.

591
00:35:44.195 --> 00:35:45.435
- Not really.

592
00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:48.229
- You should know better Desmond Thomas.

593
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.265
Don't you think it'd be wise to end this

594
00:35:50.265 --> 00:35:52.625
before someone gets hurt?

595
00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:55.063
You were always the brighter one.

596
00:35:55.063 --> 00:35:57.545
Honestly. the best thing you could do is

597
00:35:57.545 --> 00:36:00.212
to put a stop to this right now.

598
00:36:01.214 --> 00:36:02.964
- This is ridiculous.

599
00:36:14.142 --> 00:36:16.102
- What the fuck are we
going to do about Mrs. C?

600
00:36:16.102 --> 00:36:17.942
They don't even think they're hostages.

601
00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.025
We should just bail. man.

602
00:36:25.757 --> 00:36:26.633
- What?

603
00:36:26.633 --> 00:36:28.561
- Mrs. C knows who we are!

604
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:30.321
And they don't think
that they're hostages.

605
00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:33.222
- Who cares? You shouldn't
let him get you like that!

606
00:36:33.222 --> 00:36:35.389
You're the one in control.

607
00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:43.582
This is how you deal with them.

608
00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:46.931
You keep an eye on them.

609
00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:49.822
(broom thuds)

610
00:36:49.822 --> 00:36:51.083
- Not a fucking hostage?

611
00:36:51.083 --> 00:36:53.603
I'll show you not a fucking hostage!

612
00:36:53.603 --> 00:36:55.523
- You don't scare me. boy!

613
00:36:55.523 --> 00:36:57.856
- This is our storeroom now!

614
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:01.369
(Amiey whines)

615
00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:04.206
- [Des] Oi. Bobby! They're coming!

616
00:37:04.206 --> 00:37:05.873
- Not a fucking word

617
00:37:08.155 --> 00:37:10.405
or I'll put a bullet in ya!

618
00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:21.803
(women giggle)

619
00:37:21.803 --> 00:37:22.720
- Oh!
- Ooh!

620
00:37:28.153 --> 00:37:31.282
(women laugh)

621
00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.265
- Hey. ladies. Looking like
you're having a good night.

622
00:37:34.265 --> 00:37:37.623
- Yeah. spunky. I love your uniform.

623
00:37:37.623 --> 00:37:39.835
- Oh. it's-
- Yeah cute.

624
00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:41.683
(girls laugh)

625
00:37:41.683 --> 00:37:43.934
- Thanks! Uh. can I help you?

626
00:37:43.934 --> 00:37:46.105
- Oh. well. you could kiss me!

627
00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:47.993
- No. kiss me!

628
00:37:47.993 --> 00:37:50.153
(women laugh)

629
00:37:50.153 --> 00:37:53.014
- Okay. okay. Yeah. you
know the rules ladies.

630
00:37:53.014 --> 00:37:56.243
No kissing until you pay for the fuel.

631
00:37:56.243 --> 00:37:58.003
- Number six?

632
00:37:58.003 --> 00:37:59.803
- Sixty-nine.

633
00:37:59.803 --> 00:38:01.998
(women laugh)

634
00:38:01.998 --> 00:38:04.145
- You got a name. handsome?

635
00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:04.978
- Uh. Max.

636
00:38:06.505 --> 00:38:07.734
- Hmm.
- Um.

637
00:38:07.734 --> 00:38:09.651
- That's 82.20. thanks.

638
00:38:11.032 --> 00:38:14.254
- I like that name.
Have you got a bathroom?

639
00:38:14.254 --> 00:38:18.171
- I think so. I mean.
just down the side there.

640
00:38:20.723 --> 00:38:22.306
- Here you go. Max.

641
00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:31.563
- Um. you look lonely.
Maxie. You should join us.

642
00:38:31.563 --> 00:38:33.008
- Yes!

643
00:38:33.008 --> 00:38:36.624
(register rings)
(women giggle)

644
00:38:36.624 --> 00:38:39.148
- Well. I. I. I. I'd love
to. but I can't. you know?

645
00:38:39.148 --> 00:38:41.605
I've got to look after the store.

646
00:38:41.605 --> 00:38:45.628
- Oh. why can't you get him
to look after the store?

647
00:38:45.628 --> 00:38:46.944
- Oh. well. I would. you know?

648
00:38:46.944 --> 00:38:49.013
But. uh. he's a little bit slow.

649
00:38:49.013 --> 00:38:50.346
- Oh.
- You know?

650
00:38:51.325 --> 00:38:53.408
- Come on. It won't hurt.

651
00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:55.805
Only for a little bit.

652
00:38:55.805 --> 00:38:58.388
(women giggle)

653
00:39:05.715 --> 00:39:08.965
(bathroom door creaks)

654
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.853
- Did you see that? They were hot!

655
00:39:14.853 --> 00:39:17.405
Come on. man. You're not going
to tell me they weren't hot?

656
00:39:17.405 --> 00:39:19.365
- Yeah. okay. They're attractive.

657
00:39:19.365 --> 00:39:22.933
- Atrac. you don't call
girls like that attractive.

658
00:39:22.933 --> 00:39:25.765
They were simply fucking hot!

659
00:39:25.765 --> 00:39:29.073
- What would you do if all
you were to someone was hot?

660
00:39:29.073 --> 00:39:32.885
- What? The f. what's wrong with you. man?

661
00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:33.718
- Nothing.

662
00:39:35.645 --> 00:39:37.165
- Oh. Max?

663
00:39:37.165 --> 00:39:41.777
Do you think you could give
me a hand with something?

664
00:39:41.777 --> 00:39:42.610
- No way!

665
00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:47.594
Uh. just a second. Give
me your shirt. man!

666
00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:50.773
- No way! You're not going in there!

667
00:39:50.773 --> 00:39:52.635
- Oh. okay. bro. um.

668
00:39:52.635 --> 00:39:54.943
this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

669
00:39:54.943 --> 00:39:56.883
I mean. when will this ever happen again?

670
00:39:56.883 --> 00:39:57.883
- No!

671
00:39:57.883 --> 00:40:00.744
- We're robbing a servo.
two hot girls walk in.

672
00:40:00.744 --> 00:40:03.744
and they ask me to go in there with them!

673
00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:05.839
You're gonna take that away from me?

674
00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:09.773
This is my God given right.
This is my manhood on the line.

675
00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:11.190
- No fucking way!

676
00:40:18.628 --> 00:40:21.878
(bathroom door creaks)

677
00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:28.184
- Seven members so far have been taken

678
00:40:28.184 --> 00:40:30.904
into custody after drugs
and semi-automatic weapons

679
00:40:30.904 --> 00:40:33.773
have allegedly been discovered
at some of these locations.

680
00:40:33.773 --> 00:40:35.283
The siege today-

681
00:40:35.283 --> 00:40:36.116
- Look at this!

682
00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:40.415
- [Anchor] The ongoing
investigation into the club.

683
00:40:40.415 --> 00:40:44.504
- Well. they definitely don't have Brandy.

684
00:40:44.504 --> 00:40:46.913
How about Brandy. eh?

685
00:40:46.913 --> 00:40:49.144
- We'll have more as the story develops.

686
00:40:49.144 --> 00:40:52.940
- [Bobby] They could have
half of them locked up now.

687
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.334
Serves them right.

688
00:40:54.334 --> 00:40:56.386
- Police have got a few more in custody.

689
00:40:56.386 --> 00:40:57.715
A few words for the camera. please?

690
00:40:57.715 --> 00:40:59.465
What's going on here?

691
00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:03.818
It seems that the police do
have more people in custody

692
00:41:03.818 --> 00:41:06.645
and the story will unfold
as time progresses.

693
00:41:06.645 --> 00:41:07.797
We'll go back to the studio for now.

694
00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:10.157
(TV turns off)

695
00:41:10.157 --> 00:41:12.134
- What are we going to do. man?

696
00:41:12.134 --> 00:41:13.095
- With what?

697
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:16.762
- With this house. man?
We're gonna lose it.

698
00:41:17.859 --> 00:41:19.236
- What about the servo?

699
00:41:19.236 --> 00:41:20.444
- What about it?

700
00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:24.134
- 450 Gs. man. We could
do a lot with that.

701
00:41:24.134 --> 00:41:25.904
Save mum's house easy.

702
00:41:25.904 --> 00:41:28.124
- Brandy's always half watt.

703
00:41:28.124 --> 00:41:30.924
As if there's that much
money in that safe?

704
00:41:30.924 --> 00:41:33.396
- Well. even with a quarter of it.

705
00:41:33.396 --> 00:41:36.171
saves the house. head up North.

706
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:38.156
do that trip she always wanted

707
00:41:38.156 --> 00:41:41.239
and then just. you know. do whatever.

708
00:41:43.843 --> 00:41:44.760
- Whatever.

709
00:41:46.294 --> 00:41:48.122
- Look. man. You saw the report.

710
00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:50.804
I mean. they gotta have half
the Snakes locked up in there.

711
00:41:50.804 --> 00:41:54.387
They can't do their
job now. which means...

712
00:41:55.875 --> 00:41:58.105
- You can't be serious?

713
00:41:58.105 --> 00:42:01.305
You don't even know if what
Brandy's saying is true.

714
00:42:01.305 --> 00:42:04.051
- He did get it from the Snakes.

715
00:42:04.051 --> 00:42:06.551
(door creaks)

716
00:42:09.636 --> 00:42:12.053
(bird chirp)

717
00:42:15.944 --> 00:42:18.025
(knocking on door)

718
00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:20.046
- Bobby Thomas is here to see you.

719
00:42:20.046 --> 00:42:22.796
- Right. Uh. show him in. please.

720
00:42:25.036 --> 00:42:26.953
- You can come through.

721
00:42:28.097 --> 00:42:29.847
- Bobby.
- Mr. Sparks.

722
00:42:33.485 --> 00:42:35.297
- What can I help you with.

723
00:42:35.297 --> 00:42:38.345
- Com'on. Mr. Sparks.
You know why I'm here.

724
00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:42.762
- I'm sorry. Bobby. It's.
I've done everything I can.

725
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:45.242
- You Gotta give us some more time. Look.

726
00:42:45.242 --> 00:42:47.086
I've lined up a job.

727
00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:48.628
It just doesn't start till next month.

728
00:42:48.628 --> 00:42:50.105
We just need until then.

729
00:42:50.105 --> 00:42:52.522
- Please. Bobby. take a seat.

730
00:42:53.577 --> 00:42:56.766
Bobby. I've heard this too many times.

731
00:42:56.766 --> 00:42:58.756
There simply are no other options.

732
00:42:58.756 --> 00:43:00.857
You have to sell or you have to pay.

733
00:43:00.857 --> 00:43:02.455
- John. you know I'm not gonna get half

734
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:03.656
as much as what it's worth.

735
00:43:03.656 --> 00:43:04.796
Not in this market.

736
00:43:04.796 --> 00:43:06.676
- Is everything okay in here?

737
00:43:06.676 --> 00:43:08.476
- E. everything's fine.
Thank you. thank you.

738
00:43:08.476 --> 00:43:10.143
Bobby. sit down now.

739
00:43:14.381 --> 00:43:16.798
(John sighs)

740
00:43:18.584 --> 00:43:19.805
(Bobby sighs)

741
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:24.805
- Look. what if I sell the car?
Will that give us more time?

742
00:43:25.275 --> 00:43:28.775
- You still have a loan on the car. Bobby.

743
00:43:30.035 --> 00:43:34.509
If I could help I would. For
your mum. for old time's sake.

744
00:43:34.509 --> 00:43:37.009
But there's just no other way.

745
00:43:45.424 --> 00:43:48.115
(pencil scratching)

746
00:43:48.115 --> 00:43:50.879
(register beeps)

747
00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:53.379
(door creaks)

748
00:44:05.765 --> 00:44:06.598
- Hello?

749
00:44:08.543 --> 00:44:10.626
I know you're down there.

750
00:44:11.995 --> 00:44:13.635
- How can I help you?

751
00:44:13.635 --> 00:44:15.244
- Just these. thanks.

752
00:44:15.244 --> 00:44:16.784
(register beeps)

753
00:44:16.784 --> 00:44:17.685
Are you okay?

754
00:44:17.685 --> 00:44:19.102
- Yes. I am fine.

755
00:44:22.304 --> 00:44:23.483
- Des?

756
00:44:23.483 --> 00:44:26.233
- No. I don't know what you mean?

757
00:44:29.524 --> 00:44:31.515
- Why are you pretending to be Indian?

758
00:44:31.515 --> 00:44:32.348
- Oh. man.

759
00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:37.068
(Bobby groans)

760
00:44:41.296 --> 00:44:43.379
- Now it's getting kinky!

761
00:44:45.143 --> 00:44:46.325
- Isn't he supposed to be knocked out?

762
00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:47.216
What did you give him?

763
00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:50.600
- Well. he said it was etrophine.

764
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.093
It's the same shit that Dexter
uses to knock people out.

765
00:44:53.093 --> 00:44:54.272
- Well. he's not fucking knocked out.

766
00:44:54.272 --> 00:44:57.127
Are you sure you gave him the right stuff?

767
00:44:57.127 --> 00:45:00.693
- Well. not now. This'll have to do!

768
00:45:00.693 --> 00:45:03.978
(Bobby groans)
(duct tape tears)

769
00:45:03.978 --> 00:45:05.979
- [Mandy] And is he gonna be okay?

770
00:45:05.979 --> 00:45:08.923
- What are you doing to me?

771
00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:09.756
- I guess.

772
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.781
- And what are we gonna
do about Little Timmy?

773
00:45:20.781 --> 00:45:23.418
- Um. I've got some more etrophine.

774
00:45:23.418 --> 00:45:25.354
We could use that if we need to.

775
00:45:25.354 --> 00:45:26.594
- Okay. yep.

776
00:45:26.594 --> 00:45:28.177
- Yeah?
- Yep. okay.

777
00:45:29.383 --> 00:45:32.844
(bathroom door creaks)

778
00:45:32.844 --> 00:45:36.094
- Oh. Timmy Boy! Don't worry about Max.

779
00:45:37.576 --> 00:45:40.216
He's just taking a nap.

780
00:45:40.216 --> 00:45:43.376
- Yeah! Do you want a lolly?

781
00:45:43.376 --> 00:45:46.136
You've been working so hard!

782
00:45:46.136 --> 00:45:49.776
- Yeah. and Max said that
if you were a good boy.

783
00:45:49.776 --> 00:45:52.064
you could have any
lollies that you wanted.

784
00:45:52.064 --> 00:45:55.381
- Oh. really? Did he say that?

785
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:57.344
- Yeah. that's right. Timmy.

786
00:45:57.344 --> 00:46:00.296
And I think that you've
been such a good boy.

787
00:46:00.296 --> 00:46:02.633
so we can take care of the counter.

788
00:46:02.633 --> 00:46:05.153
while you go and choose
any lollies that you like.

789
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.653
- Okay! Thank you!

790
00:46:19.062 --> 00:46:19.982
- Damn!
- What?

791
00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:21.095
- Fuck!
- What?

792
00:46:21.095 --> 00:46:23.725
- It's got a free trip
circuit timer on it.

793
00:46:23.725 --> 00:46:24.794
- What does that mean?

794
00:46:24.794 --> 00:46:27.994
- It means that it won't open
until the timer goes off.

795
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:28.982
- Fuck!
- Shit!

796
00:46:28.982 --> 00:46:31.055
- I thought you said this
place was supposed to be easy!

797
00:46:31.055 --> 00:46:32.023
- I know. I know.

798
00:46:32.023 --> 00:46:33.593
Look. we're just going to have to wait

799
00:46:33.593 --> 00:46:35.655
until the timer goes off and
then we can open it then.

800
00:46:35.655 --> 00:46:36.794
- Okay. Well when is that?

801
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:40.941
Like how are we going to
know when that happens?

802
00:46:40.941 --> 00:46:45.441
- Timmy. would you mind
coming over here for a moment?

803
00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:49.296
Do you know what this is?

804
00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:51.718
- Yeah. It's a time lock safe.

805
00:46:51.718 --> 00:46:53.653
It won't open until the time's up

806
00:46:53.653 --> 00:46:55.893
or else it'll set off the alarm.

807
00:46:55.893 --> 00:46:56.726
- Fuck!

808
00:46:58.253 --> 00:47:00.053
- Oh. hey. bro.

809
00:47:00.053 --> 00:47:02.442
- Hhm. What a great idea?

810
00:47:02.442 --> 00:47:04.783
When will this ever happen
again? Untie him now!

811
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:07.861
[Bobby] Yeah. touch it.

812
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:09.083
Are you wasted?

813
00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:13.306
- They gave me. okay.

814
00:47:13.306 --> 00:47:14.226
- What did you give him?

815
00:47:14.226 --> 00:47:16.809
- Just some etrophine. I think.

816
00:47:17.818 --> 00:47:19.856
- What the fuck is etrophine

817
00:47:19.856 --> 00:47:21.135
and what do you mean you think?

818
00:47:21.135 --> 00:47:23.346
- Well. it's the same
shit that Dexter uses.

819
00:47:23.346 --> 00:47:25.037
- [Bobby] Tits in my mouth.

820
00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:29.554
This is gonna be awesome.

821
00:47:29.554 --> 00:47:30.746
- You seen Dexter?

822
00:47:30.746 --> 00:47:33.121
- Yes. I've seen Dexter

823
00:47:33.121 --> 00:47:36.864
but this doesn't look like
what happens on Dexter.

824
00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:37.697
- Dexter.

825
00:47:40.947 --> 00:47:43.816
- Bring him over to the storeroom.

826
00:47:43.816 --> 00:47:47.931
[Bobby] Best night of my life.

827
00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:49.098
Open the door!

828
00:47:50.105 --> 00:47:53.105
- Did you guys see my dick? Is it big?

829
00:47:54.426 --> 00:47:56.413
- Mandy? Sandy?

830
00:47:56.413 --> 00:47:57.365
- Sally?

831
00:47:57.365 --> 00:48:00.773
- Get the fuck in the store room!

832
00:48:00.773 --> 00:48:04.440
Get the fuck in the
motherfucking storeroom!

833
00:48:06.952 --> 00:48:09.178
- Hey. bro. That was awesome!

834
00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:10.845
You're the greatest. I love you.

835
00:48:12.246 --> 00:48:14.704
- How wasted are you?

836
00:48:14.704 --> 00:48:16.845
- Oh. maybe just a little bit.

837
00:48:16.845 --> 00:48:18.493
- This is fucking great!

838
00:48:18.493 --> 00:48:20.584
What the fuck am I gonna do with you now?

839
00:48:20.584 --> 00:48:23.834
- Don't be angry 'cause they tricked me

840
00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:26.856
but aren't they beautiful?

841
00:48:33.022 --> 00:48:34.605
- Get out here now!

842
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:37.084
- What?

843
00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:40.911
- Get the fuck out here
and take him in there now!

844
00:48:40.911 --> 00:48:44.582
- I love you. bro. I'm so pound of you.

845

anything to do with that?

- What. Brandy? I don't know
know what you're talking about.

854

- So is it just you and Bobby?

855

- Na. we grew up here.
Um. I mean. it is now.

856
00:49:35.632 --> 00:49:38.465
Our mum passed away six moths ago.

Yeah. dad left when we were young.

She smoked like a chimney.

been a pretty good mom.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:29.179
I guess I just like helping people.

887
00:51:29.179 --> 00:51:33.895
- Well. that's cool. and not
everyone can do it. takes guts.

888
00:51:33.895 --> 00:51:36.728
- Thanks! Yeah. it's good for now.

889
00:51:40.991 --> 00:51:43.060
I have to say. I don't think I've had

890
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.893
an ice cream brunch in maybe ever.

891
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.871
- I love it. It's great for hangovers.

892
00:51:49.871 --> 00:51:51.621
- Yeah. I feel fresh.

893
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.479
- Must be the company.

894
00:51:54.479 --> 00:51:56.385
- Oh. yeah? Is that right?

895
00:51:56.385 --> 00:51:57.635
- That's right.

896
00:52:01.169 --> 00:52:03.803
Oh. you got a little bit just there.

897
00:52:03.803 --> 00:52:05.945
(Des laughs)

898
00:52:05.945 --> 00:52:07.695

904
00:52:28.307 --> 00:52:30.026
- Well. this has been nice.

905
00:52:30.026 --> 00:52:31.276
- Yeah. it has.

906
00:52:32.427 --> 00:52:36.311
- So. I guess I'll let you go then.

907
00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:40.246
- Okay. um. all right.

908

909
00:52:47.517 --> 00:52:49.934

Okay. wow. um. okay then.

I'll call you.

912
00:52:57.306 --> 00:52:58.837
- Okay. call me.

913
00:52:58.837 --> 00:52:59.670

915
00:53:07.177 --> 00:53:08.738
- Um. bye.

917
00:53:17.088 --> 00:53:18.627
(hand pounding)

918
00:53:18.627 --> 00:53:20.237
(breaks squeal)

919
00:53:20.237 --> 00:53:21.070
Wait.

920
00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:29.556
(bird chirp)

921
00:53:31.888 --> 00:53:34.305
(Des groans)

922
00:53:41.219 --> 00:53:42.797
That was tolerable.

923
00:53:42.797 --> 00:53:45.257
(both laugh)

924
00:53:45.257 --> 00:53:46.924
- Yeah. It was nice.

925
00:53:49.157 --> 00:53:51.327
- Do you wanna promise me something?

926
00:53:51.327 --> 00:53:53.187
- Mabye.

927
00:53:53.187 --> 00:53:56.135
- Just. no bullshit. okay?

928
00:53:56.135 --> 00:53:59.685
- Okay. No bullshit.

929
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:07.203
(lip smack)
(birds chirp)

930
00:54:14.964 --> 00:54:16.605
- Jessie?

931
00:54:16.605 --> 00:54:19.237
- Des? What are you doing here?

932
00:54:19.237 --> 00:54:23.317
- What am I doing here? I.
what are you doing here?

933
00:54:23.317 --> 00:54:26.237
- I just finished a shift
so I came to get some chips.

934
00:54:26.237 --> 00:54:29.045
This is a service station. right?

935
00:54:29.045 --> 00:54:30.565
- Uh.

936
00:54:30.565 --> 00:54:32.187
- You didn't tell me you worked here.

937
00:54:32.187 --> 00:54:34.005
- Oh. no. I don't.

938
00:54:34.005 --> 00:54:36.096
- Well. it kind of looks like it.

939
00:54:36.096 --> 00:54:36.929
- Oh.

940
00:54:36.929 --> 00:54:37.856
- You don't have to be embarrassed.

941
00:54:37.856 --> 00:54:39.045
I used to work at a service station.

942
00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:40.325
- No. it's not that.

943
00:54:40.325 --> 00:54:42.787
- Okay. so what are you doing?

944
00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:44.537
- I'm busy right now.

945
00:54:46.015 --> 00:54:47.445
- Busy doing what?

946
00:54:47.445 --> 00:54:49.528
- I'm busy standing here.

947
00:54:52.276 --> 00:54:53.109
(Des sighs)

948
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:58.109
(upbeat music)
(Bobby yawns)

949
00:55:10.112 --> 00:55:11.279
- Hi everyone!

950
00:55:12.567 --> 00:55:15.234
How are you in the magical world

951
00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:19.829
of the store room?

952
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:22.208
(Bobby laughs)

953
00:55:22.208 --> 00:55:23.375
- He's wasted.

954
00:55:25.768 --> 00:55:28.785
- I am not wasted.

955
00:55:29.637 --> 00:55:33.737
I'm just happy to see
you wonderful people.

956
00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:38.825
Even you two lovely. lovely ladies

957
00:55:40.126 --> 00:55:44.928
who tied me up and left
me but I don't mind

958
00:55:44.928 --> 00:55:48.511
'cause I know you were
playing hard to get.

959
00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:56.284
How did you get here. Sal?

960
00:55:59.698 --> 00:56:00.698
Hey. Mrs. C.

961
00:56:04.597 --> 00:56:07.097
(Bobby sighs)

962
00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:10.768
I'm so sorry I was rude to you before.

963
00:56:10.768 --> 00:56:12.943
You were my favorite teacher.

964
00:56:12.943 --> 00:56:15.627
Just sometimes you were really scary

965
00:56:15.627 --> 00:56:18.044
when you were telling me off.

966
00:56:19.189 --> 00:56:21.678
(lips smack)

967
00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:24.261
You taste absolutely delicious.

968
00:56:25.307 --> 00:56:26.140
And you!

969
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:33.500
Other girl. I don't know you but you rock!

970
00:56:35.873 --> 00:56:38.206
Hey my little Indianian guy!

971
00:56:42.097 --> 00:56:46.532
I'm sorry I yelled at you
before. Give me a hug.

972
00:56:46.532 --> 00:56:47.365
- No.

973
00:56:48.553 --> 00:56:50.211
- But I'm sorry.

974
00:56:50.211 --> 00:56:51.868
- You're not sorry.

975
00:56:51.868 --> 00:56:55.911
- Yes I am! Tell him I'm sorry!

976
00:56:55.911 --> 00:56:58.182
Tell him I'm sorry!

977
00:56:58.182 --> 00:57:00.153
- What the fuck are you guys doing. Bobby?

978
00:57:00.153 --> 00:57:02.932
- Uh. well. we are robbing this place.

979
00:57:02.932 --> 00:57:05.822
(Bobby laughs)

980
00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:08.154
- You called me a curry muncher.

981
00:57:08.154 --> 00:57:13.154
- I'm sorry I called you a
curry muncher. I love curry.

982
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:15.932
- You scared me with that gun.

983
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:20.932
- I scared you with the gun! I
didn't know what I was doing!

984
00:57:22.033 --> 00:57:22.866
Come here.

985
00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:29.077
- Okay. I forgive you.

986
00:57:30.594 --> 00:57:34.094
- Hey. it's pretty big in this store room.

987
00:57:37.012 --> 00:57:39.562
We could have a party in here!

988
00:57:39.562 --> 00:57:42.320
- What the hell were you guys thinking?

989
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:47.320
- Des. why are you acting so weird? Great!

990
00:57:47.639 --> 00:57:49.660
Just when I think I meet
a really amazing guy

991
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.881
and he turns into a complete weirdo.

992
00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:53.150
- It's not like that.

993
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:56.000
- Do you work here or not?

994
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Last chance.

995
00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:00.760
- Hey. (clears throat) I
don't mean to interrupt.

996
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.424
but can I get some more smokes. man?

997
00:58:03.424 --> 00:58:05.219
- You sold smokes to these kids?

998
00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:06.052
- No.

999
00:58:06.927 --> 00:58:08.389
- Yeah. you did.

1000
00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:09.947
- No. I didn't.

1001
00:58:09.947 --> 00:58:12.487
- Yeah. if you want to get
all technical about it.

1002
00:58:12.487 --> 00:58:14.839
you didn't. but you were here.

1003
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:17.057
- What is going on? Does he work here?

1004
00:58:17.057 --> 00:58:18.279
- It sure looks like it.

1005
00:58:18.279 --> 00:58:20.279
- Yeah. it does. Thanks.

1006
00:58:21.519 --> 00:58:23.215
Keep the change.

1007
00:58:23.215 --> 00:58:25.715
- Jessie. wait. I'll show you.

1008
00:58:26.967 --> 00:58:27.800
(Jessie sighs)

1009
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.207
- Show me what?

1010
00:58:29.207 --> 00:58:30.687
- Yeah. show her what?

1011
00:58:30.687 --> 00:58:31.520
- Shut up!

1012
00:58:37.797 --> 00:58:39.318
Open it.

1013
00:58:39.318 --> 00:58:40.151
- What?

1014
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:41.484
- Open the door!

1015
00:58:43.247 --> 00:58:45.747
(locks click)

1016
00:58:51.058 --> 00:58:51.891
Come on.

1017
00:58:59.487 --> 00:59:01.207
- Des. what is going on?

1018
00:59:01.207 --> 00:59:02.290
- Hey. Jenny!

1019
00:59:03.279 --> 00:59:04.446
- It's Jessie!

1020
00:59:09.269 --> 00:59:11.602
(boys thud)

1021
00:59:14.246 --> 00:59:17.538
- Peter Grummisch and Mark Owen.

1022
00:59:17.538 --> 00:59:19.719
- Mrs. Carrignton?

1023
00:59:19.719 --> 00:59:23.553
- Whoa! She's your teacher. too?

1024
00:59:24.882 --> 00:59:28.138
We're like cousins.
Let's hug that shit out.

1025
00:59:28.138 --> 00:59:31.526
- Dude. no way.

1026
00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:33.538
- You two boys come into the store

1027
00:59:33.538 --> 00:59:38.438
and try to buy cigarettes and
call me names when I say no.

1028
00:59:38.438 --> 00:59:40.909
Well. you're in my world now.

1029
00:59:40.909 --> 00:59:42.858
- This is your world?

1030
00:59:42.858 --> 00:59:45.905
- Hey. hey. hey. little
guys. is that true?

1031
00:59:45.905 --> 00:59:49.815
You can't be mean to my man. man. Amiey.

1032
00:59:49.815 --> 00:59:51.315
He's the man. man.

1033
00:59:52.517 --> 00:59:55.535
- Did you just call him man
man or did you call me man?

1034
00:59:55.535 --> 00:59:56.664
- He called you man!

1035
00:59:56.664 --> 00:59:59.914
- Yeah. man. like I said. he's the man!

1036
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:05.853
- This is what happens
when you skip school. boys!

1037
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.845
- Oh. cool! Look at him.

1038
01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:11.664
- You're robbing a servo?

1039
01:00:11.664 --> 01:00:12.693
- Well. when you put it like that-

1040
01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:14.344
- Can you just be
fucking straight with me?

1041
01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:17.818
- Okay. technically
we're robbing the servo.

1042
01:00:17.818 --> 01:00:21.662
- Oh my! What the hell
have I gotten myself into?

1043
01:00:21.662 --> 01:00:24.125
- Hey. don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1044
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:27.594
- Everything's gonna be
fine. Can you hear yourself?

1045
01:00:27.594 --> 01:00:28.427
- What?

1046
01:00:28.427 --> 01:00:29.823
- Well. usually when you rob somewhere.

1047
01:00:29.823 --> 01:00:32.394
you don't take it over and
start fucking working there!

1048
01:00:32.394 --> 01:00:35.023
- I know it sounds crazy
but the safe is on a-

1049
01:00:35.023 --> 01:00:37.940
- Time lock. so we had to take over

1050
01:00:38.874 --> 01:00:42.103
and that's where you came in.

1051
01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:44.333
Actually. it's when you all came in.

1052
01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:46.653
(Bobby laughs)

1053
01:00:46.653 --> 01:00:50.863
Isn't that awesome? You
guys are the greatest!

1054
01:00:50.863 --> 01:00:54.343
- Cool! I love being in a robbery.

1055
01:00:54.343 --> 01:00:57.749
- Hey. you got any of those smokes left?

1056
01:00:57.749 --> 01:01:01.851
- Oh. no. No. we sold them to our mates.

1057
01:01:01.851 --> 01:01:04.684
Yeah. but we got something better.

1058
01:01:06.026 --> 01:01:07.552
- Weed!
- Hey!

1059
01:01:07.552 --> 01:01:10.613
(people cheer)

1060
01:01:10.613 --> 01:01:13.363
- Well. no time like the present.

1061
01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:16.186
- Wait. you can't smoke in here.

1062
01:01:16.186 --> 01:01:20.752
- Hey. hey. hey. don't. don't
stress. my Indianian friend.

1063
01:01:20.752 --> 01:01:24.394
- Well. I think I might be a good idea.

1064
01:01:24.394 --> 01:01:25.227
- What?

1065
01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:30.936
- A little hocus pocus can ease the mind.

1066
01:01:31.885 --> 01:01:32.718
- No way!

1067
01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:38.615
Hocus pocus? I didn't know you
were an old hippie. Mrs. C.

1068
01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:40.363
- When in Rome.

1069
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.205
(people giggle)

1070
01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.386
- Come with me!

1071
01:01:46.386 --> 01:01:47.415
- To Queensland?

1072
01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:48.248
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:48.248 --> 01:01:49.834
- You've got to be kidding me.

1074
01:01:49.834 --> 01:01:52.445
- Look. last night was
the most amazing night

1075
01:01:52.445 --> 01:01:55.724
that I've ever had and I didn't want to

1076
01:01:55.724 --> 01:01:57.357
but the only reason I'm doing this is

1077
01:01:57.357 --> 01:01:59.565
to save out mum's house.

1078
01:01:59.565 --> 01:02:01.755
It's all we've got left.

1079
01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:04.676
- You want me to run away
with you to Queensland?

1080
01:02:04.676 --> 01:02:08.267
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

1081
01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:13.267
- Jessie. you hate your job and
you said you needed a break!

1082
01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:14.237
You're the one that said

1083
01:02:14.237 --> 01:02:16.186
you should let loose every now and then.

1084
01:02:16.186 --> 01:02:19.716
- Des. when I said letting
loose. I didn't mean rob a servo

1085
01:02:19.716 --> 01:02:22.383
and go on the run to Queensland!

1086
01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:25.877
- Come on. Jessie.

1087
01:02:25.877 --> 01:02:27.437
I know it sounds crazy.

1088
01:02:27.437 --> 01:02:30.475
but don't tell me you
don't feel something. too.

1116
01:03:34.512 --> 01:03:36.471
- Yeah. sorry.

1117
01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:37.672
- Well?

1118
01:03:37.672 --> 01:03:40.381
- It was fucking awesome.
man. She's beautiful.

1119
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:43.683
- Well. I'm glad it got you
in a good mood. Let's go!

1120
01:03:43.683 --> 01:03:44.516
- Where?

1121
01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:45.349
- Come on.

1122
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:48.722
(Bobby taps car door)

1123
01:03:48.722 --> 01:03:49.805
Come on. man.

1124
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:17.032
450 big ones. man. Couldn't
get easier than this.

1125
01:04:17.032 --> 01:04:20.882
- This is crazy. man!
It's not a small thing.

1126
01:04:20.882 --> 01:04:24.215
- That's the thing. It is a small thing.

1127
01:04:25.056 --> 01:04:27.342
- How do you even know there's
that much money in there?

1128
01:04:27.342 --> 01:04:28.512
- It doesn't matter.

1129
01:04:28.512 --> 01:04:31.632
The Red Belly Blacks have
gotta have good intel.

1130
01:04:31.632 --> 01:04:34.472
- First of all. we got this from Brandy.

1131
01:04:34.472 --> 01:04:36.522
Second of all. you can't
be fucking serious!

1132
01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:40.011
- What about the house? What about mum?

1133
01:04:40.011 --> 01:04:44.011
- Bobby. this isn't breaking
into Terry Williams' Gas Depot!

1134
01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:45.792
You know he knows it's you doing it.

1135
01:04:45.792 --> 01:04:48.470
- Come on. man. It's a piece of piss.

1136
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:52.083
I mean. no security. no cameras.

1137
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:54.392
Old Man Barnaby is such a tight-ass.

1138
01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:59.392
He probably wouldn't change
lightbulbs if he didn't have to.

1139
01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.147
Look. you just lost your job

1140
01:05:02.147 --> 01:05:05.590
and I haven't had work for weeks now.

1141
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.128
- I don't know. man.
What if someone sees us?

1142
01:05:09.128 --> 01:05:10.752
People know your car!

1143
01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:11.820
- Fucking hell!

1144
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.352
We'll park the car down
in the industrial state.

1145
01:05:14.352 --> 01:05:16.512
Get those BB guns we got from Uncle Steve.

1146
01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:19.083
They look real enough.
Then we head to the store.

1147
01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.854
It takes two seconds.

1148
01:05:20.854 --> 01:05:24.232
Cruise back to the car. bags
full of cash. into Queensland.

1149
01:05:24.232 --> 01:05:25.232
House saved!

1150
01:05:28.483 --> 01:05:30.395
There's just one catch.

1151
01:05:30.395 --> 01:05:31.312
- Just one?

1152
01:05:32.322 --> 01:05:34.904
- We gotta do this tonight.

1153
01:05:34.904 --> 01:05:37.237

- [Bobby] Uh. smoking a doobie?

(Bobby laughs)

1158
01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.430
[Bobby] But she set the alarm off.

1159
01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:59.203
- Could you be any dumber?

1160
01:05:59.203 --> 01:06:01.592
- The fire brigade are on their way now.

1161
01:06:01.592 --> 01:06:04.494
I told you you can't smoke in here.

1162
01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.734

1205

- What's that?

1211
01:08:25.193 --> 01:08:26.943
- There are no wires.

1212
01:08:30.142 --> 01:08:32.062
- It's a wireless system.

1213
01:08:32.062 --> 01:08:34.002
- [Kirk] That's right.

01:08:34.002 --> 01:08:35.633

1217
01:08:38.377 --> 01:08:42.502
It smells like cigarettes.
but a bit more funky.

1218
01:08:42.502 --> 01:08:44.279
- You know how serious the false alarm is?

1219
01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:45.113
- Yes. sir. I-

1220
01:08:45.113 --> 01:08:46.662
- I said. you know how much shit we have

1221
01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:50.662

someone's gonna be paying for it.

1232
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.262

1233
01:09:24.262 --> 01:09:25.412
- What won't happen again?

1234
01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.245

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:28.652
- That's what I thought you said.

1236
01:09:28.652 --> 01:09:29.627
Let's go!

1237
01:09:36.252 --> 01:09:37.085
- [Kirk] Hey. Charlie!

1238
01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:38.092
- Hey. Kirk! How are you?

1239
01:09:38.092 --> 01:09:39.193
- What's going on here?
- Good.

1240
01:09:39.193 --> 01:09:41.110
- Nothing. false alarm.

1241
01:09:42.004 --> 01:09:42.837
- [Charlie] Going to the game Saturday?

1242
01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:43.862
- Absolutely! See you there!

1243
01:09:43.862 --> 01:09:47.683
- [Charlie] See you. man. See you. Gunner.

1244
01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:50.081
- Hello Officer. How can I help you?

1245
01:09:50.081 --> 01:09:51.737
- Oh. just a routine inspection.

1246
01:09:51.737 --> 01:09:54.480
It's normal procedure when
there's a false alarm.

1247
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.572
- Oh. dude! This is awesome!

1248
01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:58.561
We're like hostages in a robbery!

1249
01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:02.728
- No! You're like hostages
in two robberies. yeah!

1250
01:10:03.572 --> 01:10:04.736
- Hey. no. no. no!

1251
01:10:04.736 --> 01:10:06.892
You can't rob a place
that's already been robbed.

1252
01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:08.201
I told you before.

1253
01:10:08.201 --> 01:10:11.622
- Oh. yeah. that. Yeah. we
don't know what that was.

1254
01:10:11.622 --> 01:10:15.232
- You haven't seen anything
strange tonight. love?

1255
01:10:15.232 --> 01:10:16.815
- No. sure haven't.

1256
01:10:18.412 --> 01:10:21.247
- What about you back there?

1257
01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:24.921
Is that a ladies shirt you're wearing?

1258
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:25.754
- Uh.

1259
01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:27.087
- It's mine.
- I-

1260
01:10:28.105 --> 01:10:28.938
- Yeah?

1261
01:10:28.938 --> 01:10:30.952
- Yeah. I forgot my shirt

1262
01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:34.369
and since he was on stocking. we swapped.

1263
01:10:35.658 --> 01:10:38.313
The boss. he's real strict on uniforms

1264
01:10:38.313 --> 01:10:41.044
and we just want to keep him happy.

1265
01:10:41.044 --> 01:10:41.877
- I see.

1266
01:10:43.218 --> 01:10:48.135
Well there's no harm wearing
the correct uniform. is there?

1267
01:10:49.265 --> 01:10:52.015
(button pops)
Oh!

1268
01:10:57.817 --> 01:11:00.150
I think this belongs to you.

1269
01:11:01.497 --> 01:11:02.330
- Thanks.

1270
01:11:03.756 --> 01:11:04.985
- Who would have thought wearing

1271
01:11:04.985 --> 01:11:07.424
the wrong uniform could be so dangerous?

1272
01:11:07.424 --> 01:11:08.516
(Jessie giggles)

1273
01:11:08.516 --> 01:11:11.886
- Yeah. Who would have thought?

1274
01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:13.846
(clattering)

1275
01:11:13.846 --> 01:11:15.013
What was that?

1276
01:11:16.345 --> 01:11:21.345
(all shushing)
(all giggling)

1277
01:11:23.574 --> 01:11:26.324
It doesn't sound like rats to me.

1278
01:11:28.036 --> 01:11:30.745
- [Voice On Radio] Calling all
cars. Charlie. you out there?

1279
01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:34.930
We have a 1054 in
progress on Cooper Street.

1280
01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:38.247
- This is 422. I'm on my way.

1281
01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:44.648
(rock music fades)

1282
01:11:46.628 --> 01:11:49.019
- What the hell have I gotten myself into?

1283
01:11:49.019 --> 01:11:50.358
- That was crazy!

1284
01:11:50.358 --> 01:11:52.158
- We almost went to jail!

1285
01:11:52.158 --> 01:11:55.109
- Okay. no need to get
upset. You were brilliant!

1286
01:11:55.109 --> 01:11:58.748
- I should be at home. in bed. asleep.

1287
01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:00.260
- Well. don't get angry at me.

1288
01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.998
You're the one that decided to stay.

1289
01:12:01.998 --> 01:12:04.668
- I decided to stay? Oh. fine.

1290
01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:07.908
This is your mess. You clean it up!

1291
01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:09.660
- What are you doing?

1292
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.228
(door slams)

1293
01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:12.828
- Lady troubles?

1294
01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.068
- What? What are you doing?

1295
01:12:15.068 --> 01:12:17.068
- What's wrong?

1296
01:12:17.068 --> 01:12:20.108
Oh. hey. uh. I think we
should get everyone back

1297
01:12:20.108 --> 01:12:21.649
into the store room 'cause one

1298
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:24.289
of the kids took a crap in
there and it fucking stinks!

1299
01:12:24.289 --> 01:12:26.769
- Do you even care that the firemen came?

1300
01:12:26.769 --> 01:12:27.969
And then the police?

1301
01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:32.025
- Yeah! You did a great job!

1302
01:12:32.025 --> 01:12:35.078
The world is in perfect balance. man.

1303
01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:38.860
Good and evil are. like. totally even.

1304
01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.077
- What?

1305
01:12:41.844 --> 01:12:46.844
- Well. good is. like.
here and evil is here.

1306
01:12:48.429 --> 01:12:53.204
They're in perfect
harmony. It's beautiful.

1307
01:12:55.468 --> 01:12:58.948
And we're the good guys! Don't you get it?

1308
01:12:58.948 --> 01:13:02.615
And the outside world?
They're the bad guys.

1309
01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.147
- You are a fucking idiot.

1310
01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:12.306
(hands clap)

1311
01:13:15.328 --> 01:13:20.276
All right. let's get everyone
back into the store room.

1312
01:13:20.276 --> 01:13:21.348
(knocks on door)

1313
01:13:21.348 --> 01:13:24.065
Jessie. hey. come on. Don't be upset.

1314
01:13:24.065 --> 01:13:25.380
- [Jessie] Go away!

1315
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.338
- I can't do that right now.

1316
01:13:28.338 --> 01:13:31.705
Look. I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

1317
01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:35.205
The only way out is if we help each other.

1318
01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:39.417
- Yeah. Julie. It's all right.

1319
01:13:39.417 --> 01:13:42.545
- Just open the door. Jess. please?

1320
01:13:42.545 --> 01:13:44.233
You're the coolest girl I've ever met.

1321
01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:46.748
I want to make it up to you.

1322
01:13:46.748 --> 01:13:48.787
- Yeah. Julie. We'll make it up to you.

1323
01:13:48.787 --> 01:13:49.620
- Shut up!

1324
01:13:52.508 --> 01:13:54.057
- Only on one condition.

1325
01:13:54.057 --> 01:13:54.974
- Anything!

1326
01:13:55.822 --> 01:13:59.428
- That you never do
anything this stupid again.

1327
01:13:59.428 --> 01:14:00.599
- Done!

1328
01:14:00.599 --> 01:14:01.432
- Okay!

1329
01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:05.532
(all cheer)

1330
01:14:06.577 --> 01:14:08.433
(Sandy whistles)
(lips smack)

1331
01:14:08.433 --> 01:14:10.044
(Mandy laughs)

1332
01:14:10.044 --> 01:14:12.211
- All right. everybody in.

1333
01:14:13.652 --> 01:14:15.282
Come on. in there.

1334
01:14:15.282 --> 01:14:17.949
(Mrs. C laughs)

1335
01:14:31.252 --> 01:14:32.085
- Hey!

1336
01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.289
(all laugh)
(bag pops)

1337
01:14:36.289 --> 01:14:41.206
Oi. everybody! All we have is
about four more hours to go.

1338
01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:43.789
So all we have to do is wait it out

1339
01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:45.496
and we can all go home.

1340
01:14:45.496 --> 01:14:48.040
- Okay. fine. but if we're
gonna be here for awhile.

1341
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.840
at least get us some cold drinks.

1342
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.707
- Okay. Amiey. can you
please give me a hand?

1343
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:03.566
(door slams)

1344
01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:11.690
(shotgun blast)

1345
01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:13.728
- Don't any fucking cunt
move a fucking muscle

1346
01:15:13.728 --> 01:15:16.380
or I'll fucking blow
your fucking brains out!

1347
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.980
- Brandy?

1348
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.188
- Des? What the fuck are you doing here?

1349
01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:22.410
- You know this clown?

1350
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:24.699
- Yeah. yeah. I know him!

1351
01:15:24.699 --> 01:15:27.980
Left me tied to a pole the
last time I saw him. didn't he?

1352
01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.628
Who's in charge now?

1353
01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:33.570
- Uh. please don't kill
us! Please don't kill us!

1354
01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.388
- Shut the fuck up. Punjabi!
- Please don't kill us!

1355
01:15:35.388 --> 01:15:36.290
- You piece of shit!

1356
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:38.659
- My name is not Punjabi.

1357
01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.689
- I don't give a fuck!

1358
01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:43.038
I'm the one with the
gun and I said shut up!

1359
01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.268
- He's not gonna stop doing that

1360
01:15:44.268 --> 01:15:46.688
if you keep putting that gun in his face!

1361
01:15:46.688 --> 01:15:48.268
It makes him nervous!

1362
01:15:48.268 --> 01:15:52.351
- Did I tell you to fucking
talk? I said shut up!

1363
01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:54.900
Hey! Ah. get off me!

1364
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.788
(Brandy yells)

1365
01:15:56.788 --> 01:15:59.839
- I said not to do that! Now say sorry!

1366
01:15:59.839 --> 01:16:01.450
- No!

1367
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:04.368
- You put him the fuck down!

1368
01:16:04.368 --> 01:16:06.500
- Not until he says sorry.

1369
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.333
- What?

1370
01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:09.438
You're fucking joking. aren't ya?

1371
01:16:09.438 --> 01:16:13.355
- You heard me! He has
to say he's sorry first.

1372
01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:17.187
- Okay. Say fucking sorry.

1373
01:16:17.187 --> 01:16:18.980
- But-
- I said.

1374
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.450
- Say fucking sorry. you
dumb fucking cunt! Now!

1375
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:24.340
- I'm sorry.

1376
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.450
- Louder!

1377
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.808
- Sorry!

1378
01:16:31.445 --> 01:16:34.799
You're lucky. Des! You're
lucky I wasn't watching.

1379
01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:38.231
- Where is the safe?

1380
01:16:38.231 --> 01:16:40.711
- It's over there but it's on a time lock

1381
01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:43.576
and if you try and open it.
you'll set off an alarm.

1382
01:16:43.576 --> 01:16:46.758
- Jimmy. this place was
supposed to be low key.

1383
01:16:46.758 --> 01:16:47.987
- Yeah. it's supposed to.

1384
01:16:47.987 --> 01:16:49.907
- That's what Brandy told me. too.

1385
01:16:49.907 --> 01:16:50.745
- What?

1386
01:16:50.745 --> 01:16:53.158
- He's the reason I'm here.

1387
01:16:53.158 --> 01:16:55.854
- You're here to rob this place?

1388
01:16:55.854 --> 01:16:58.521
You told this cunt club secrets?

1389
01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:05.147
- Shit! What are we gonna do. Ray?

1390
01:17:05.147 --> 01:17:06.884
- When does it open?

1391
01:17:06.884 --> 01:17:07.717
- 6:30.

1392
01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:11.467
- Well then. I guess we'll have

1393
01:17:11.467 --> 01:17:13.798

1394
01:17:13.798 --> 01:17:15.965
- Well. that's a surprise.

1395
01:17:20.947 --> 01:17:23.267
- You're a bit of a smart cunt. aren't ya?

1396
01:17:23.267 --> 01:17:25.600

1397
01:17:31.326 --> 01:17:33.159
Get the fucking shirt!

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:42.591
Put it on.

1399
01:17:45.886 --> 01:17:48.803
You're gonna be our checkout bitch.

1400
01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:56.131
- Oh. what the fuck is going on in here?

1401
01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:02.333
Ray. you better get a look at this.

1402
01:18:05.526 --> 01:18:08.776
(feet scrape on floor)

1403
01:18:17.106 --> 01:18:19.856
(Aimey whimpers)

1404
01:18:27.478 --> 01:18:28.627
- You guys having some sort

(Jimmy sniffs)

1408
01:18:41.523 --> 01:18:43.122
You smell good.

1409
01:18:43.122 --> 01:18:46.534
- Hey. man. How about a
little respect for the ladies?

1410
01:18:46.534 --> 01:18:48.538
(hand slaps)

1411
01:18:49.405 --> 01:18:54.405
- You. too? Oh. tonight
just gets better and better!

1412
01:18:54.683 --> 01:18:56.635
(gun thuds)

1413
01:18:56.635 --> 01:18:59.302
(thugs chuckle)

1414
01:19:01.075 --> 01:19:03.075
- Has anyone else got something to say?

1415
01:19:03.075 --> 01:19:03.908
- Well. I think-

1416
01:19:03.908 --> 01:19:05.216
(hand slaps)
(body thuds)

1417
01:19:05.216 --> 01:19:08.526
(Jimmy laughs)

1418
01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:09.859
- How about now?

1419
01:19:13.435 --> 01:19:15.654
No. that's what I thought.

1420
01:19:15.654 --> 01:19:17.736
- This isn't fun anymore.

1421
01:19:17.736 --> 01:19:18.569
- Nope.

1422
01:19:20.915 --> 01:19:23.082
- I'm a fucking bandit bitch!

1423
01:19:34.587 --> 01:19:36.920
(gun thuds)

1424
01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:53.436
- Get off me!

1425
01:19:53.436 --> 01:19:56.019
(man chuckles)

1426
01:19:56.947 --> 01:19:59.616
- She doesn't want to play.

1427
01:19:59.616 --> 01:20:02.598
(lips smack)

1428
01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:03.431
- No!

1429
01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:04.264
- Come on. hon.

1430
01:20:04.264 --> 01:20:05.097
- No!
- Come on!

1431
01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:07.264
(gunshot)

1432
01:20:11.735 --> 01:20:14.746
(door slams)

1433
01:20:14.746 --> 01:20:15.746
- Oh my God!

1434
01:20:17.973 --> 01:20:18.968
- Oh ah!

1435
01:20:18.968 --> 01:20:21.438
- What have you gone and
done to yourself. numb nuts?

1436
01:20:21.438 --> 01:20:24.537
- You really are dumb as fuck. aren't ya?

1437
01:20:24.537 --> 01:20:27.133
- Help me! I need a doctor!

1438
01:20:27.133 --> 01:20:30.437
- How the fuck did you shoot yourself?

1439
01:20:30.437 --> 01:20:32.718
- Help me! Come on. you guys!

1440
01:20:32.718 --> 01:20:34.368
I really need a doctor!

1441
01:20:34.368 --> 01:20:36.507
- Hey. Jimmy. did you shoot this cunt?

1442
01:20:36.507 --> 01:20:37.340
- Na.

1443
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.448
- And I didn't shoot ya.

1444
01:20:38.448 --> 01:20:39.888
- Help me! Please?

1445
01:20:39.888 --> 01:20:43.856
- Well? It isn't our
fucking problem. is it?

1446
01:20:43.856 --> 01:20:46.689
Put him in the back with the rest.

1447
01:20:49.688 --> 01:20:53.021
(Brandy groans in pain)

1448
01:20:54.198 --> 01:20:55.198
- What happened to him?

1449
01:20:55.198 --> 01:20:58.957
- [Jimmy] He shot himself.
What's it fucking look like?

1450
01:20:58.957 --> 01:21:00.466
- It's okay. I'm a nurse.

1451
01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:01.986
(Brandy yells)

1452
01:21:01.986 --> 01:21:02.819
Quick get me that paper towel.

1453
01:21:02.819 --> 01:21:06.283
We need something to stop the bleeding.

1454
01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:09.194
(Brandy whimpers)

1455
01:21:09.194 --> 01:21:10.845
- What the fuck are we gonna do now. Ray?

1456
01:21:10.845 --> 01:21:12.965
- It's not our fucking
problem. Leave him in there.

1457
01:21:12.965 --> 01:21:16.585
- I knew that little prick
was fucking trouble! Fuck!

1458
01:21:16.585 --> 01:21:17.443
(pounds door)

1459
01:21:17.443 --> 01:21:19.610
- Jim. calm the fuck down.

1460
01:21:20.634 --> 01:21:24.365
It's not our fucking problem. all right?

1461
01:21:24.365 --> 01:21:25.385
- And we're gonna stay in here.

1462
01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:29.589
There's blood all over
that fucking shirt. Ray.

1463
01:21:29.589 --> 01:21:30.916
- We have the guns. okay?

1464
01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:32.047
Anyone come through that door.

1465
01:21:32.047 --> 01:21:34.155
we'll put 'em in that fucking room.

1466
01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.572
Fucking won't we?

1467
01:21:38.276 --> 01:21:41.426
- Quick. we're running out of
time. Just go get him. now.

1468
01:21:41.426 --> 01:21:44.176
(pounds on door)

1469
01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:51.693
(door bangs)

1470
01:21:54.778 --> 01:21:58.422
- Please? We have to get him to hospital!

1471
01:21:58.422 --> 01:21:59.255
- Oh.

1472
01:22:00.698 --> 01:22:02.276
(boot thuds)
(Brandy whimpers)

1473
01:22:02.276 --> 01:22:07.176
- Well. you're a nurse. You fix him.

1474
01:22:07.176 --> 01:22:11.946
(Brandy yells)
(blood squirts)

1475
01:22:11.946 --> 01:22:14.446
(boots thuds)

1476
01:22:17.564 --> 01:22:20.236
(Brandy whimpers)

1477
01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:22.405
- We can't just sit here.
We have to do something.

1478
01:22:22.405 --> 01:22:24.036
- Yeah. well. I don't care about him.

1479
01:22:24.036 --> 01:22:26.732
I just don't want to get raped.

1480
01:22:26.732 --> 01:22:29.399
(Brandy groans)

1481
01:22:30.978 --> 01:22:33.311
- I'm sorry. Please help me.

1482
01:22:34.188 --> 01:22:36.816
- What about your guns?
Do you still have them?

1483
01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:37.887
- You mean this?

1484
01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:39.218
(gun clicks)

1485
01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:41.567
They're BB guns. We got them as kids.

1486
01:22:41.567 --> 01:22:43.150
- You used BB guns?

1487
01:22:45.369 --> 01:22:47.748
Well. they look real.

1488
01:22:47.748 --> 01:22:48.788
- Yeah. they look real but the one's

1489
01:22:48.788 --> 01:22:51.008
that those guys have are real.

1490
01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.468
Look.

1491
01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.156
- You're a Red Belly
now. aren't ya. Billy?

1492
01:22:54.156 --> 01:22:57.938
- Des. we have to do something.
He's losing blood fast!

1493
01:22:57.938 --> 01:23:00.188
- What am I supposed to do?

1494
01:23:02.985 --> 01:23:03.818
Fuck!

1495
01:23:05.076 --> 01:23:05.993
- Hey. Des.

1496
01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:10.600
(metal clangs)

1497
01:23:13.508 --> 01:23:15.758
(gun taps)

1498
01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:31.377
(fire alarm rings)

1499
01:23:31.377 --> 01:23:33.794
(rock music)

1500
01:23:41.835 --> 01:23:42.668
- Now!

1501
01:23:42.668 --> 01:23:44.247
(door thuds)
(gas hisses)

1502
01:23:44.247 --> 01:23:46.997
(glass shatters)

1503
01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:51.956
- You guys go. I'll cover you.

1504
01:23:51.956 --> 01:23:54.738
♪ We've sat down to life
with our heads in the sand ♪

1505
01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.876
♪ It's time to make a stand ♪

1506

(gas hisses)

1510
01:24:16.647 --> 01:24:17.480
- Fuck!

1511
01:24:23.165 --> 01:24:24.316
Shit!

1512
01:24:24.316 --> 01:24:25.788
- Bobby. forget about it.

1513
01:24:25.788 --> 01:24:27.178
- [Bobby] No. I got this.

1514
01:24:27.178 --> 01:24:29.511
(gun thuds)

1515
01:24:41.678 --> 01:24:44.345
(intense music)

1516
01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:47.039
- [Des] Bobby!

1517
01:24:47.039 --> 01:24:48.396
(gunshot)
(Bobby grunts)

1518
01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:49.229
No! Bobby!

1519
01:24:52.026 --> 01:24:54.693
Hey. hey. hey. Bobby! No. Bobby!

1520
01:24:55.598 --> 01:24:56.848
Hey! No. Bobby!

1521
01:24:58.076 --> 01:25:02.127
(footsteps thud)
Hey. Bobby!

1522
01:25:02.127 --> 01:25:06.036

Hey. come on!

01:25:09.406 --> 01:25:11.538
(Ray chuckles)

1525

1526
01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:24.830
(gunshot)
(Ray coughs)

1527
01:25:31.476 --> 01:25:33.167
Hey. Bobby! Wake up!

1528
01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:35.917
(hand taps face)

1529
01:25:37.167 --> 01:25:39.791
(Bobby coughs)

1530
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:43.053
- Oh. man! Talk about a bad come down?

1531
01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:46.470
(Des and Jessie chuckle)

1532
01:25:47.719 --> 01:25:49.518
- Are you okay?

1533
01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:51.435
- I don't feel so good.

1534
01:25:55.967 --> 01:25:59.879
Now. get me out of here before
this guys bleeds all over me.

1535
01:25:59.879 --> 01:26:02.013
(Bobby laughs and coughs)

1536
01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:07.013
(sires blare)
(firetruck horn honks)

1537
01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:14.072
- Come on!
- Fuck!

1538
01:26:14.072 --> 01:26:16.155
- Motherfucking! Fucking!

1539
01:26:19.028 --> 01:26:21.195
Fuck you. ah. you fucking!

1540
01:26:26.137 --> 01:26:27.766
- Is he gonna be okay?

1541
01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:28.988
- He's very lucky.

1542
01:26:28.988 --> 01:26:32.057
- Hey. hey. where's my little buddy?

1543
01:26:32.057 --> 01:26:33.356
- I'm right here my friend!

1544
01:26:33.356 --> 01:26:35.375
- We've got to get him to the hospital.

1545
01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:39.286
- All right. I'll meet
you at the hospital.

1546
01:26:39.286 --> 01:26:42.956
- So. why were they running the store?

1547
01:26:42.956 --> 01:26:44.897
- We were lucky those
two young me were here.

1548
01:26:44.897 --> 01:26:48.268
Otherwise. I don't know
what we would have done.

1549
01:26:48.268 --> 01:26:50.954
- So. the bikers. they
were here the whole time?

1550
01:26:50.954 --> 01:26:54.108
- We would have been robbed
if it weren't for these two.

1551
01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:56.103
- Yeah. they saved us.

1552
01:26:56.103 --> 01:26:59.103
(upbeat rock music)

1553
01:27:05.347 --> 01:27:10.148
- Oh. here comes my boss.
I better go talk to him.

1554
01:27:10.148 --> 01:27:11.898
- Hey. Amiey. thanks.

1555
01:27:17.093 --> 01:27:19.843
(Amiey whimpers)

1556
01:27:22.504 --> 01:27:25.057
- Well. I think you owe
me a trip to Queensland.

1557
01:27:25.057 --> 01:27:26.124
- Is that right?

1558
01:27:26.124 --> 01:27:28.564
- A deal's a deal. isn't it?

1559
01:27:28.564 --> 01:27:30.365
- What could go wrong?

1560
01:27:30.365 --> 01:27:31.635
(Des giggles)

1561
01:27:31.635 --> 01:27:33.344
(Jessie giggles)

1562
01:27:33.344 --> 01:27:35.761
(lips smack)

1563
01:27:41.195 --> 01:27:43.536
- [Des] We still lost mum's home

1564
01:27:43.536 --> 01:27:45.165
but the bank didn't take it.

1565
01:27:45.165 --> 01:27:47.435
It was burned down in retribution

1566
01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:50.016
by the Red Belly Black Snakes.

1567
01:27:50.016 --> 01:27:52.485
What we didn't know is
that mum had it insured

1568
01:27:52.485 --> 01:27:54.485
so we got a huge payout!

1569
01:28:00.645 --> 01:28:03.483
Me and Bobby took that
family holiday after all.

1570
01:28:03.483 --> 01:28:06.066
(upbeat music)

1571
01:28:07.456 --> 01:28:08.645
And we got to spread mum's ashes

1572
01:28:08.645 --> 01:28:11.562
in Queensland just like she wanted.

1573
01:28:27.624 --> 01:28:30.374
(water splashes)

1574
01:29:04.395 --> 01:29:06.056
If you look up the definition of life

1575
01:29:06.056 --> 01:29:08.464
in a dictionary it says:

1576
01:29:08.464 --> 01:29:10.575
The condition that distinguishes organisms

1577
01:29:10.575 --> 01:29:14.504
from inorganic objects and
dead organisms being manifested

1578
01:29:14.504 --> 01:29:16.576
by a growth through metabolism.

1579
01:29:16.576 --> 01:29:19.595
reproduction. and the power of adaptation

1580
01:29:19.595 --> 01:29:24.095
to environment through changes
originating internally.

1581
01:29:26.384 --> 01:29:28.736
Sounds pretty complicated. right?

1582
01:29:28.736 --> 01:29:31.653
Funny thing is life is complicated.

1583
01:29:32.645 --> 01:29:35.955
It's full of choices and
so many different things.

1584
01:29:35.955 --> 01:29:39.043
Some are easy. Some are hard.

1585
01:29:39.043 --> 01:29:42.365
Things don't always work
out the way you maybe hoped

1586
01:29:42.365 --> 01:29:43.904
but that's what's funny.

1587
01:29:43.904 --> 01:29:45.487
That's life itself.

1588
01:29:49.575 --> 01:29:51.656
Death comes for us all one day

1589
01:29:51.656 --> 01:29:55.765
but death is only change and
change is a part of life.

1590
01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:58.544
So without death. there is no change

1591
01:29:58.544 --> 01:30:01.303
and without change there is no life.

1592
01:30:01.303 --> 01:30:03.886
It's just the way it has to be.

1593
01:30:07.374 --> 01:30:12.374
Your life is based on the
choices and decisions you make.

1594
01:30:12.387 --> 01:30:15.456
So try to always make good decisions

1595
01:30:15.456 --> 01:30:17.965
'cause you only get one life.

1596
01:30:17.965 --> 01:30:20.936
(laughing)

1597
01:30:20.936 --> 01:30:22.496
So whatever you do.

01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:26.879
