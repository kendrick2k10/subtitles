01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:37.159
Yeah. we're gonna find a way

1894
01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.161
to build it into
the whole system.

1895
01:24:39.204 --> 01:24:43.208
[CHUCKLES]
I'm shocked. Elated.

1896
01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:46.081
Just... shocked.

1897
01:24:46.864 --> 01:24:48.083
It's all because of you.

1898
01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:51.912
You inspired me
to follow my own path.

1899
01:24:53.262 --> 01:24:55.438
You showed me how special
this town was.

1900
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:58.093
how special Christmas was.
how...

1901
01:25:00.356 --> 01:25:01.661
how special you are.

1902
01:25:03.837 --> 01:25:05.448
Now. I know you're engaged...

1903
01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:06.536
I'm not engaged.

1904
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.104
I know you saw me
with the ring.

1905
01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:11.106
and then.
we were talking and...

1906
01:25:13.282 --> 01:25:15.197
I just needed you
to know that.

1907
01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.546
So you two...

1908
01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:18.200
Are over. Over.

[LAUGHS]

1913
01:25:26.991 --> 01:25:29.428
I mean... [LAUGHS]
I'm sorry.

1914
01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:31.909

1917
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:37.915
Stop.

1918
01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:40.091
[LAUGHS]

You know. it turns out.

1920
01:25:44.965 --> 01:25:47.142
Really? Is that so?

1921
01:25:48.534 --> 01:25:50.710
Well. your whole
livestream idea.

1922
01:25:50.754 --> 01:25:52.756
it helped me figure out
my new path.

1923
01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:55.280
And I'll be able
to teach
all my classes

1924
01:25:55.324 --> 01:25:56.977
right here in Mistletoe.

1925

To reach anyone.
anywhere.

1926
01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:03.158
Funny thing about that is
I'm staying here. too.

1927
01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:05.769
You're looking at the new
operations manager
of the resort.

1928
01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:07.901
Oh.[BOTH LAUGHS]

1929
01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:11.688
I have to stay here
to make sure that
my vision becomes a reality.

1930
01:26:11.731 --> 01:26:15.605
So we'll both be here...
together.

1931
01:26:16.693 --> 01:26:18.434
Yeah.Hmm.

1932
