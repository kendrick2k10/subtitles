[dramatic music]

4
00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.920
- [Liam] The Dyatlov Pass
incident

5
00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.234
is the story of the death
of nine student hikers

6
00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:28.959
in the Ural Mountains.

7
00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:33.619
It's often referred to as
Russia's greatest mystery.

8
00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:40.074
In 1959. after failing to report
back.

9
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.939
nine students were found frozen
to death

10
00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:44.941
in sub polar conditions.

11
00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:50.705
- When I was working for
the Moscow Times newspaper

12
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.638
and I came across the
information

13
00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:54.606
about the Dyatlov Pass mystery.

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.091
the difference between
all kind of mysteries

15
00:00:57.126 --> 00:00:58.403
and this particular one.

16
00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:01.716
is that it's very well
documented.

17
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.546
There is criminal case.

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.065
There are pictures.

19
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.756
There are diaries.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.036
There are still witnesses who
were there. a rescue party.

21
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.004
So one can still do
investigation.

22
00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:16.938
- [Liam] Found without
their winter clothes

23
00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.768
miles from their shredded tent

24
00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:23.117
and with no sign of an
avalanche or natural disasters.

25
00:01:23.152 --> 00:01:25.430
Yet somehow. they suffered
injuries

26
00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:26.948
that crushed their bodies

27
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:28.640
and horrifically for some.

28
00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:31.850
their tongues and eyeballs were
missing.

29
00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:36.441
- It appears that the
officials involved at the time

30
00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:40.203
of the autopsies basically
tried to sweep this entire thing

31
00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:41.722
under the rug.

32
00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:46.175
trying to make it look like
some unfortunate accident.

33
00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.798
- [Liam] Mysterious lights
were seen in the sky

34
00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:51.559
and the Russian KGB swarmed the
site.

35
00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:55.218
clouding the whole story
in 60 years of mystery.

36
00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:13.409
Today. there are two sides to
this case.

37
00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:17.482
What was reported by the
official
investigators at the time.

38
00:02:17.516 --> 00:02:21.037
which seems almost willfully
incomplete.

39
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.971
And then there's the years
of conspiracy theories

40
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.458
of Soviet government
coverups and military tests.

41
00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:44.302
- The cover-ups are so
farfetched I think.

42
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.789
They're a way for people to
explain

43
00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:50.342
the unexplainable or the
unexplained.

44
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.761
Whereas the reality is some
cases are just tough to solve.

45
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.696
- [Liam] The story has
inspired many Russian TV shows

46
00:02:59.731 --> 00:03:03.148
and documentaries
pedaling armchair theories

47
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.082
from alien visitors to the
Russian Yeti.

48
00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.167
[dramatic music]

49
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.687
- [Liam] With so many
conflicting stories.

50
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:27.586
I've come to Russia to ask the
question.

51
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:31.797
what is the true story
of the Dyatlov Pass?

52
00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:34.662
[dramatic music]

53
00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:17.947
I became obsessed with
this story after reading

54
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.571
the hundreds of bizarre
and unusual theories.

55
00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:24.505
Military coverups. UFOs

56
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.163
and even a Russian Yeti have
been blamed.

57
00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:33.687
But I soon realize the real
story is even more sinister

58
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:35.516
than I ever could have imagined.

59
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:47.563
Using the hikers' actual
photos and diaries.

60
00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:49.530
this is what we know so far.

61
00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:54.363
In January. 1959. a
team of 10 young hikers

62
00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:56.951
led by group leader. Igor
Dyatlov.

63
00:04:56.986 --> 00:05:00.990
began the doomed expedition
deep into the Ural Mountains.

64
00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:04.373
10 days into their journey.

65
00:05:04.407 --> 00:05:07.065
and the team reaches the
peak known to the locals

66
00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.860
as the Dead Mountain.

67
00:05:08.894 --> 00:05:11.932
Then. something goes terribly
wrong.

68
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.212
In the middle of the
night. for reasons unknown.

69
00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:18.387
the hikers cut their way out of
the tent.

70
00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.251
Tracks showed they fled down the
mountain

71
00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:22.701
in freezing conditions

72
00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:25.152
without winter clothes or boots.

73
00:05:26.947 --> 00:05:29.329
Weeks after they were due to
report back.

74
00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:33.643
search parties were sent out.
only to uncover the worst.

75
00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:36.646
They were found more than a mile
away.

76
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:40.719
each one suffering inexplicable
injury.

77
00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:44.205
Ranging from cuts and
bruises to fractured skulls.

78
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.312
broken ribs and even a missing
tongue.

79
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.660
The Soviet government closed the
case

80
00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:52.179
and sealed the records.

81
00:05:52.213 --> 00:05:55.424
stating only that the
hikers had frozen to death

82
00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:57.046
for reasons unknown.

83
00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:04.018
Renewed interest began
more than 30 years later

84
00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:06.400
after the fall of the Soviet
Union.

85
00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.852
And the original case file
was released to the public.

86
00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:13.442
Searching through hundreds
of online articles.

87
00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.237
I started to spot some
inconsistencies.

88
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.448
That's when I found a group of
Russians

89
00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:21.588
dedicated to uncovering the
truth.

90
00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:24.798
I reached out to Yuri
Kuntsevitch

91
00:06:24.832 --> 00:06:27.007
founder of the Dyatlov
Foundation

92
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.389
in Yekaterinburg. Russia.

93
00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:30.976
I asked a lot of questions.

94
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:34.186
hardly expecting to receive a
reply.

95
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.705
And then I did.

96
00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:47.234
[dramatic music]

97
00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:50.824
What started out as a somewhat
obsessive Google search.

98
00:06:50.858 --> 00:06:52.722
just got very real.

99
00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:01.662
I think I've always been
obsessed
with trying to figure out

100
00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.699
why things are the way they are.

101
00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:06.805
And I don't like. we
don't know. as an answer.

102
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:10.982
I've always loved exploring
weird

103
00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:13.053
and sometimes dangerous
locations.

104
00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:14.434
And I think that's what brought
me

105
00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:17.954
to documentary filmmaking
in the first place.

106
00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:20.819
I started my filmmaking
career 20 years ago

107
00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:22.476
in television news.

108
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:24.478
And I realized pretty early on.

109
00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:26.446
if you want to get the real
story.

110
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.207
you have to get out and talk to
people.

111
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.416
And this story is driving me
crazy.

112
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.626
I keep watching so many
online videos and podcasts

113
00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:37.318
all repackaging the same
information.

114
00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:39.493
But that's not an investigation.

115
00:07:39.528 --> 00:07:42.151
It's not adding anything new to
the story.

116
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:46.258
Before I decide if I should go
to Russia.

117
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:49.572
I have someone closer to home
that can help me understand

118
00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:50.918
the hikers story.

119
00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:01.791
Svetlana Oss is a Russian
journalist.

120
00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:04.069
now living in the US.

121
00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:07.417
She broke what was probably the
first English language story

122
00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:11.249
on the Dyatlov group for
the Moscow Times in 2007.

123
00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.702
She has since written one of
the most well-researched books

124
00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.117
on the subject.

125
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:20.465
And I'm keen to learn more
from her about this case.

126
00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:24.089
- There is so much behind the
story.

127
00:08:24.124 --> 00:08:29.094
There is so much information
that need to be considered.

128
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.514
Some people believe
that aliens killed them.

129
00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:39.657
Some people believe it was
American spies

130
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:41.072
who are responsible.

131
00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:42.763
There are so many crazy stories

132
00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:47.630
that it was sex responsible
for some tension

133
00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:52.670
among the group members and
they just killed each other.

134
00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:57.226
I think all these
theories are pretty weird.

135
00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:01.023
- [Liam] The unusual details in
this case

136
00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:04.716
have given rise to so
many strange theories.

137
00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:06.891
The first and perhaps most
confusing

138
00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:10.032
is that the criminal case
appears to have begun

139
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:13.587
before the hikers were
even reported missing.

140
00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:16.107
- This is a criminal case.
I believe you have it.

141
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:18.903
It's a new cover.

142
00:09:18.937 --> 00:09:19.766
- [Liam] Okay.

143
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.491
- Some people believe that the
very fact

144
00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:26.600
that we can find six here
says that the authorities

145
00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:31.018
knew something before. that
they wanted to hide something.

146
00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:33.055
- [Liam] What's unusual is that
the hikers

147
00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:34.815
were not due to report back

148
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.439
until at the very earliest.
the 12th of February.

149
00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:40.407
So how could a case have been
started

150
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:43.272
a week before anyone
would have even suspected

151
00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:44.825
they were missing?

152
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.897
For many. this has been one of
the most compelling arguments

153
00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:49.865
for Soviet government coverup.

154
00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:53.454
But for me. it's proof
that there's so much

155
00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:56.388
that's misunderstood about this
case.

156
00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:58.459
There's another document in the
file.

157
00:09:58.494 --> 00:09:59.944
which we know from its detail

158
00:09:59.978 --> 00:10:03.223
was clearly from an
interview conducted in March.

159
00:10:03.257 --> 00:10:06.502
but it was accidentally
dated the 6th of February.

160
00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:09.022
And it's this date that
was copied in error

161
00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:10.333
to the front cover.

162
00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.199
A simple clerical error igniting
years

163
00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:16.650
of conspiracy theories.

164
00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:19.411
But the mysteries certainly
don't stop there.

165
00:10:19.446 --> 00:10:22.069
and others are harder to
explain.

166
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.385
I'm convinced more than ever

167
00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:30.733
that if I want to find the
truth. I have to go to Russia.

168
00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:34.703
I keep telling myself it will be
safe.

169
00:10:34.737 --> 00:10:37.740
but without knowing what
actually happened to the hikers.

170
00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:38.983
how can I be sure?

171
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.645
[dramatic music]

172
00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:55.240
Having filmed documentaries
around the world.

173
00:10:55.275 --> 00:10:58.243
I'm used to a certain
amount of the unknown.

174
00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:00.487
But this is my first time in
Russia.

175
00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:03.283
and certainly. my first time
without a production team

176
00:11:03.317 --> 00:11:04.249
or support.

177
00:11:05.768 --> 00:11:07.459
Unsure how welcomed we would be

178
00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:10.600
by the Russian government
for investigating this case.

179
00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:13.500
my cameraman and I have
flown in under the radar

180
00:11:13.534 --> 00:11:16.883
and told as few people as
possible.

181
00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:21.370
Easier for us to go unnoticed
perhaps easier to go missing.

182
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:28.411
[dramatic music]

183
00:11:34.624 --> 00:11:36.730
Yuri Kuntsevitch was just a
young boy

184
00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:41.286
when he attended the funerals
of the hikers in 1959.

185
00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:44.427
He himself joined the
university's Explorers Club

186
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:46.947
and has since been on
many winter expeditions.

187
00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:50.019
including several to the Dyatlov
Pass.

188
00:11:50.054 --> 00:11:52.712
He's now at the very center of
this story

189
00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:55.266
as curator of the Dyatlov
foundation.

190
00:12:11.454 --> 00:12:12.455
His home office

191
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.769
has become a real life
treasure trove of documents.

192
00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:19.152
evidence and personal
belongings from the hikers.

193
00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:22.120
Some of which are at the
very heart of the mystery.

194
00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:25.089
Tell me. I know there
is a famous flashlight

195
00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.884
that was found on the tent.

196
00:12:26.918 --> 00:12:28.126
Is this the flashlight?

197
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.070
So someone threw it on top of
the scene.

198
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:42.623
That's unusual. isn't it?

199
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.468
The cameras found in the
tent and on Zolotaryov.

200
00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:01.401
along with several rolls of
film.

201
00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:04.576
give us some of the best
evidence in the case.

202
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:09.167
Yet none are as mysterious
as the famous 34th frame.

203
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:39.301
This last picture taken by the
hikers

204
00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:42.787
is just one of many strange
details that have convinced Yuri

205
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.997
and his colleagues that
this was no accident.

206
00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:50.415
But if something scared
them out of the tent.

207
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.419
why didn't they just return
when the threat had passed?

208
00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:57.664
Why would they leave behind
their warm clothes and boots?

209
00:13:57.698 --> 00:13:59.908
Everything they needed to stay
alive.

210
00:14:03.463 --> 00:14:06.121
[upbeat music]

211
00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:13.887
- They were a young people
and they were friends.

212
00:14:13.922 --> 00:14:17.857
They all were students at
Ural Polytechnical University.

213
00:14:18.927 --> 00:14:22.206
For them going to mountains to
challenge

214
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.795
their elements was
something really exciting.

215
00:14:27.728 --> 00:14:29.972
Igor Dyatlov was considered

216
00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:34.977
to be the most experienced
member of the Explorers Club.

217
00:14:35.598 --> 00:14:39.085
This guy was kind of not
interested in anything else

218
00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:43.158
but in what we call
tourism. going to mountains.

219
00:14:43.192 --> 00:14:45.608
It was like his passion.

220
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:52.374
Zina. she had such a bright
personality.

221
00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:55.066
She was in many expeditions.

222
00:14:55.101 --> 00:15:00.071
Some people think that Igor
really was involved with Zina.

223
00:15:00.969 --> 00:15:02.384
which is not true.

224
00:15:02.418 --> 00:15:03.799
Probably he was into her

225
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:08.804
because we know that her
picture was found in his pocket.

226
00:15:08.838 --> 00:15:12.014
We know by now that she was not
interested

227
00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:13.809
in Igor romantically

228
00:15:13.843 --> 00:15:16.916
because she liked another
guy. Yuri Doroshenko.

229
00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:21.679
We just know that he came
from a very poor family.

230
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.958
He was a very brave person.

231
00:15:24.993 --> 00:15:26.511
On one expedition.

232
00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:30.619
there was a bear approaching the
tent.

233
00:15:30.653 --> 00:15:33.104
Having nothing in his hands.

234
00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:37.833
he confronted the bear
and made the bear leave.

235
00:15:37.867 --> 00:15:41.975
And of course. Zina saw this
and she was really impressed.

236
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.151
Maybe it was the moment
when she fell in love.

237
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.571
But this was over by the time
the expedition was scheduled.

238
00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:54.677
they still were on good terms.

239
00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.129
- [Liam] Much of what we now
know

240
00:15:58.164 --> 00:16:01.788
from the group's journey comes
from their very own diaries.

241
00:16:01.822 --> 00:16:03.963
which were found abandoned in
that tent.

242
00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:24.431
- Lyudmila was experienced in
tourism too.

243
00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:29.022
She looked like a really shy.
cute girl

244
00:16:29.057 --> 00:16:31.369
but she was very strong.

245
00:16:31.404 --> 00:16:36.409
Once she was even shot in her
leg by mistake by some Hunter.

246
00:16:37.272 --> 00:16:39.999
And she persevered through that.

247
00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:47.592
Rustem Slobodin was the most
athletic guy in the group.

248
00:16:48.662 --> 00:16:51.734
He was really well-trained
physically.

249
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:55.186
I know that the father of
Rustem just couldn't believe

250
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.707
that Rustem couldn't make
through that.

251
00:17:00.743 --> 00:17:04.885
Sasha Kolevatov was a cool guy
among them.

252
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.199
We don't see him often on
pictures.

253
00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:11.685
He was a very private person.

254
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.204
- [Liam] One member of the team

255
00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:16.690
proves to be even more
enigmatic to this day.

256
00:17:16.725 --> 00:17:20.660
37 year old Semyon Zolotaryov
wasn't previously known

257
00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:22.110
to the rest of the group

258
00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:24.629
but he had requested
to join the expedition

259
00:17:24.664 --> 00:17:27.253
just weeks before their
departure.

260
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:31.084
- [Svetlana] He was working
as instructor of tourism.

261
00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:34.018
He also needed one more
expedition

262
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:37.953
for some upgrading in his work.

263
00:17:37.987 --> 00:17:40.300
- [Liam] An experienced
outdoorsman and soldier.

264
00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:43.131
Zolotaryov was awarded
medals for his service

265
00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:45.098
in World War II.

266
00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:46.789
And despite the age difference.

267
00:17:46.824 --> 00:17:50.379
it seems Zolotaryov was quickly
accepted into the group.

268
00:17:51.346 --> 00:17:52.933
- [Svetlana] We know that the
students

269
00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:55.143
kind of embraced this guy.

270
00:17:55.177 --> 00:17:58.698
He got really well with
the rest in the group.

271
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.945
Well Thibeaux. he could
make friends easily.

272
00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:10.227
Pretty soon. he has become
inseparable with Zolotaryov.

273
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.715
Thibeaux was pretty mature and
serious guy

274
00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:18.338
despite being very young.

275
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.171
- 23 year-old Yuri
Krivonischenko
was considered the joker

276
00:18:23.205 --> 00:18:24.758
amongst the group.

277
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:27.106
And his playful antics almost
changed

278
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.660
the entire course of events.

279
00:18:29.694 --> 00:18:33.353
- [Svetlana] They were
awaiting for their next train.

280
00:18:33.388 --> 00:18:37.461
He asked. "Lyuda. can
you give us some money

281
00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:40.153
for going to the cafe?"

282
00:18:40.188 --> 00:18:42.500
She had all the money for the
trip.

283
00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:45.676
And for some reasons she said
no.

284
00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:02.210
- The whole group asked the
officers to let Yuri go.

285
00:19:02.244 --> 00:19:05.385
which was pretty brave of them.

286
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.008
Because at that time in Soviet
Union.

287
00:19:08.043 --> 00:19:10.390
you don't want to mess with
police.

288
00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:14.808
The very fact that the whole
group spoke up for Yuri.

289
00:19:14.843 --> 00:19:18.536
testifies that they were
really. really great friends.

290
00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:23.058
- [Liam] There was a 10th member

291
00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:24.956
of the doomed expedition.

292
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:27.718
The only one who would return
alive.

293
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:33.310
- Yuri Yudin is an enigma
person.

294
00:19:33.344 --> 00:19:35.691
Girls trusted him.

295
00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.348
He was not cool.

296
00:19:37.383 --> 00:19:39.626
He was not sarcastic.

297
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:43.423
He was just kind and a good
friend.

298
00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:49.118
Yuri had to quit the trip.

299
00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:55.124
I know that he suffered a
great deal because of this.

300
00:19:55.159 --> 00:20:00.164
He told me. "If I could
ask God only one question.

301
00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:03.547
that would be what
happened to my friends?"

302
00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.767
- Dyatlov and the team
are commemorated here

303
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:18.734
at the Yekaterinburg cemetery.

304
00:20:20.288 --> 00:20:22.290
It's a powerful moment for me.

305
00:20:22.324 --> 00:20:25.120
And a reminder that these
people weren't just some story

306
00:20:25.154 --> 00:20:28.917
on the internet. but were
real people with real lives.

307
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:30.712
families and friends.

308
00:20:31.644 --> 00:20:33.508
Being here makes me realize

309
00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:36.683
that if I really want to
understand what happened to
them.

310
00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:39.617
I need to understand their
journey.

311
00:20:39.652 --> 00:20:42.689
I have to attempt to
retrace the hikers' steps

312
00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:44.346
to the Dyatlov Pass.

313
00:20:46.969 --> 00:20:50.318
Named after the expedition
leader. Igor Dyatlov.

314
00:20:50.352 --> 00:20:52.975
the Dyatlov Pass is a
dangerous place to reach

315
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.908
in winter even today.

316
00:20:56.185 --> 00:20:58.222
But I found someone willing to
guide me

317
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:01.052
on what should be an eight day
expedition

318
00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:04.193
to the sub polar region
of the Ural Mountains.

319
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:08.508
I'm told if anyone can get
me there. it's this man.

320
00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:11.994
- How's the weather looking?

321
00:21:12.823 --> 00:21:14.721
- It's getting better. yeah.

322
00:21:16.792 --> 00:21:17.621
- Yeah.

323
00:21:19.554 --> 00:21:21.383
What's the route. it's a train
up.

324
00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:25.214
- Okay. straight to there.

325
00:21:47.685 --> 00:21:49.342
- When we get to the Pass.

326
00:21:49.377 --> 00:21:52.000
we will stay one night. first
night.

327
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.636
- But if anyone was to get
hurt or anything like that.

328
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:11.088
what's the plan to get...

329
00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:13.642
- To get out.

330
00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:20.442
- [Interpreter] There is no
exit.

331
00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:42.844
- So. the camera gear
is all pretty much ready

332
00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:47.711
and yeah. tomorrow we go on
our journey to the Dyatlov Pass

333
00:22:47.745 --> 00:22:50.610
and I'm pretty excited
for the adventure of it.

334
00:22:50.645 --> 00:22:52.198
I've got to admit.

335
00:22:52.232 --> 00:22:54.580
But at the same time.
apprehensive.

336
00:22:54.614 --> 00:22:56.098
It's serious undertaking.

337
00:22:56.133 --> 00:22:59.481
I was told that we needed to
upgrade our winter equipment

338
00:22:59.516 --> 00:23:01.690
because some of the stuff I
brought wasn't good enough.

339
00:23:01.725 --> 00:23:04.521
I think there's no
messing around with this.

340
00:23:04.555 --> 00:23:06.730
I mean. this is serious
conditions.

341
00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:09.664
We can't forget that a
number of the hikers died

342
00:23:09.698 --> 00:23:13.322
from hypothermia and that's
something we've really got

343
00:23:13.357 --> 00:23:15.808
to take into consideration.

344
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:21.469
Tomorrow. the journey begins
to the frozen wilderness

345
00:23:21.503 --> 00:23:24.299
and the very mountain
where the Dyatlov group

346
00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:26.853
spent their last night alive.

347
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:33.412
[dramatic music]

348
00:23:49.807 --> 00:23:52.396
What do you think might
have happen to them?

349
00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:54.363
- Yeah. your opinion.

350
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.904
- [Liam] Facing increased media
attention.

351
00:24:17.939 --> 00:24:22.495
the prosecutor's office launched
a new investigation in 2018

352
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.050
and its recent conclusion
backed the avalanche theory.

353
00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:29.985
The report stated that
the hikers fled their tent

354
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.506
at the first signs of an
avalanche on Mount
Kholat-Syakhl.

355
00:24:35.266 --> 00:24:37.130
Descending far from the tent

356
00:24:37.165 --> 00:24:39.236
without the winter clothes or
boots.

357
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.274
they subsequently died from
hypothermia and natural events.

358
00:24:44.793 --> 00:24:47.589
The finding seems to
present a simple conclusion

359
00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:51.835
to the case. but for
many. it doesn't hold up.

360
00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:54.182
Vladislav Karelin was a fellow
hiker

361
00:24:54.216 --> 00:24:56.046
and friend of Dyatlov.

362
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.946
He joined the search
efforts to find his friends.

363
00:25:21.105 --> 00:25:24.730
83 year-old Alexsie. was
close friends with the group

364
00:25:24.764 --> 00:25:28.941
and also has serious
doubts about an avalanche.

365
00:25:50.963 --> 00:25:53.862
Perhaps the investigation
photos from the time

366
00:25:53.897 --> 00:25:57.176
explain why the lead
investigator. Lev Ivanov.

367
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.972
felt that such an
avalanche was implausible.

368
00:26:01.007 --> 00:26:03.803
One of the last photos taken by
the hikers

369
00:26:03.838 --> 00:26:07.220
clearly shows ski poles placed
at the front of the tent.

370
00:26:08.325 --> 00:26:12.122
These ski poles seem to have
been unmoved by any avalanche

371
00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:15.228
when the search teams
arrived several weeks later.

372
00:26:16.229 --> 00:26:19.060
[dramatic music]

373
00:26:44.533 --> 00:26:46.397
- [Liam] With little more
than a few hours sleep

374
00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:47.536
on the train.

375
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:52.369
we retraced the hikers' 50
mile journey to Vizhay by car.

376
00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:54.889
The cramped vehicle seemed
surprisingly capable

377
00:26:54.923 --> 00:26:56.822
on these snow covered roads.

378
00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.789
but that's not the case for
everyone.

379
00:26:59.997 --> 00:27:02.344
It strikes me just how important
it is

380
00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:05.485
to help your fellow traveler
in these freezing conditions.

381
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:07.936
After all. you never know

382
00:27:07.971 --> 00:27:10.042
when it might be your time in
need.

383
00:27:10.974 --> 00:27:14.080
And it's not lost on me
that Lyuda's next diary note

384
00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:17.532
on the very same stretch
of road is an uncanny echo

385
00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:18.844
of our own journey.

386
00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:41.452
- [Liam] Vizhay was the
last official village

387
00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:43.040
on the hikers journey

388
00:27:43.075 --> 00:27:45.146
and gateway to the Ural
Mountains

389
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.080
for many adventurous hikers.

390
00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:50.599
[dogs howling]

391
00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:52.740
The team makes last minute
preparations

392
00:27:52.774 --> 00:27:54.949
for the ambitious journey ahead.

393
00:27:54.983 --> 00:27:58.297
Our group of four will
lead on snowmobile.

394
00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:02.646
A backup team will follow a day
or so behind on Husky sleds.

395
00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:05.235
I'm curious to find out

396
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:07.755
what the team thinks about the
mystery.

397
00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:09.964
So tell me.

398
00:28:09.998 --> 00:28:12.518
what do you think might have
happened to the Dyatlov team?

399
00:29:01.084 --> 00:29:02.188
- Do you believe

400
00:29:02.223 --> 00:29:04.846
that's something that's possible
that could have happened?

401
00:29:07.504 --> 00:29:10.369
The Mansi are the indigenous
people that have lived

402
00:29:10.403 --> 00:29:14.235
in the Russian Siberian
region for thousands of years.

403
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:16.927
Some members of a prominent
Mansi family

404
00:29:16.962 --> 00:29:19.965
even offered to help
with the search efforts.

405
00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:22.933
And as possible witnesses
to the strange events.

406
00:29:22.968 --> 00:29:25.591
I'm hoping to encounter
some of the Mansi people

407
00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:26.730
on our journey.

408
00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:33.323
There's no backing out now.

409
00:29:33.357 --> 00:29:36.567
Whatever happened to the hikers
in 1959.

410
00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:39.570
we'll just have to hope
was a one off incident.

411
00:29:41.883 --> 00:29:43.264
- [Narrator] "January 26"

412
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.584
- [Liam] Leaving the last real
town

413
00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:56.242
and any access to emergency
services.

414
00:29:56.277 --> 00:29:58.589
we follow the wide meandering
path

415
00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:00.557
of the frozen Lozva river.

416
00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:06.080
We're traveling 100 miles
on an eight day expedition.

417
00:30:06.114 --> 00:30:08.013
through freezing temperatures

418
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:11.913
and dangerous conditions
to reach the Dyatlov Pass.

419
00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:16.953
The biting cold reminds me

420
00:30:16.987 --> 00:30:19.472
that no one really knows what
happened

421
00:30:19.507 --> 00:30:21.440
to the hikers that night.

422
00:30:21.474 --> 00:30:23.545
At a place called Mount
Kholat-Syakhl

423
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.411
or in English. the Dead
Mountain.

424
00:30:34.591 --> 00:30:36.420
Four days into their journey.

425
00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:38.664
and the group reached a small
logging camp

426
00:30:38.698 --> 00:30:40.873
called Settlement 41.

427
00:30:40.908 --> 00:30:42.979
These hardworking men of the
Urals

428
00:30:43.013 --> 00:30:46.637
may have been among the last
people to see the hikers alive.

429
00:31:01.135 --> 00:31:03.413
- [Liam] The following
day. the team negotiated

430
00:31:03.447 --> 00:31:06.899
with one of the locals to take
their packs by horse and cart

431
00:31:06.934 --> 00:31:09.453
for the next leg of their
journey.

432
00:31:09.488 --> 00:31:11.352
But even without the heavy
packs.

433
00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:14.631
it took the team seven
hours of tough ski hiking

434
00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:17.013
to arrive at this derelict
settlement.

435
00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:20.188
Abandoned seven years earlier.

436
00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:23.398
it was one of Russia's infamous
gulags.

437
00:31:23.433 --> 00:31:25.849
A forced labor camp for
criminals.

438
00:31:27.264 --> 00:31:28.956
Undeterred by its past.

439
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.855
the team found one hut still
intact enough

440
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.995
to provide modest shelter for
the night.

441
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:40.553
But for Yuri Yudin. the cold
weather and arduous journey

442
00:31:40.588 --> 00:31:44.419
had flared up his back pain.
forcing him to make a decision

443
00:31:44.454 --> 00:31:46.732
that would profoundly affect his
fate.

444
00:31:59.987 --> 00:32:02.955
- [Liam] Yuri said an emotional
goodbye to his friends.

445
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.302
looking forward to seeing them
again soon.

446
00:32:06.372 --> 00:32:08.685
Oblivious to the events that
would unfold

447
00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:10.652
in just three short days.

448
00:32:12.137 --> 00:32:16.210
Yuri died in 2013. age 75.

449
00:32:16.244 --> 00:32:19.040
never knowing what really
happened that tragic night.

450
00:32:20.386 --> 00:32:24.287
At his request. he was buried
in Yekaterinburg Cemetery.

451
00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:28.049
next to his friends. reunited at
last.

452
00:32:29.292 --> 00:32:32.019
[dramatic music]

453
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.233
Our expeditions in the Dyatlov
Pass

454
00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:41.545
was about to face it's own
challenges.

455
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.344
We reach a small frozen river
outlet

456
00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:48.759
that has partially thawed.

457
00:32:52.246 --> 00:32:53.454
Worryingly. all around.

458
00:32:53.488 --> 00:32:55.904
I hear the surface ice
cracking beneath us.

459
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.501
Thankfully. we reached safety
and a well earned rest.

460
00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:32.527
- [Liam] It seems the
group had no indication

461
00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:36.635
that in just three short
days. disaster would strike.

462
00:33:47.508 --> 00:33:50.718
It may be hard to imagine
that people would live here

463
00:33:50.752 --> 00:33:54.515
but the Mansi and Khanty peoples
of Northern Western Siberia

464
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:57.794
have called this area home
for thousands of years.

465
00:34:00.107 --> 00:34:02.661
These indigenous people
traditionally survive

466
00:34:02.695 --> 00:34:06.078
through fishing. hunting
and herding reindeer.

467
00:34:06.113 --> 00:34:08.908
Much of this way of life remains
today.

468
00:34:10.358 --> 00:34:12.257
Since the 13th century.

469
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:15.087
the two separate groups
of Mansi and Khanty people

470
00:34:15.122 --> 00:34:18.435
were often united in fiercely
defending their lands

471
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.472
against the invading Russians.

472
00:34:21.749 --> 00:34:24.303
But by the time of Soviet era
Russia.

473
00:34:24.338 --> 00:34:27.099
the indigenous way of
life suffered greatly

474
00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:28.756
as their lands were taken

475
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.447
and their numbers diminished.

476
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:35.797
Their shamans and even folk
customs were persecuted.

477
00:34:35.832 --> 00:34:37.523
So it was not unreasonable

478
00:34:37.558 --> 00:34:40.216
that some of the Mansi
and Khanty populations

479
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.149
had a distrust and resentment

480
00:34:42.183 --> 00:34:44.220
towards the Soviet Russians.

481
00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:48.914
Dyatlov and his team however.

482
00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:51.917
were greatly intrigued by
these indigenous people.

483
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:53.643
And we're excited to learn more

484
00:34:53.677 --> 00:34:55.610
of their language and customs.

485
00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:21.326
- [Liam] We arrive at a Mansi
village.

486
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.088
some 25 miles away from the
Dyatlov Pass.

487
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:27.815
And I'm keen to find out
what the villages remember

488
00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:29.334
about the incident.

489
00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:04.852
This woman's father even
joined the rescue team.

490
00:36:04.886 --> 00:36:05.887
Do you like living here?

491
00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:10.858
It's very cold though.

492
00:36:13.723 --> 00:36:16.312
We're making a film
about the Dyatlov team.

493
00:36:16.346 --> 00:36:17.520
has she heard of them?

494
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:43.684
Several Mansi. well known
and respected by officials

495
00:36:43.718 --> 00:36:47.619
were hired as experts to help
trace the missing hikers.

496
00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:51.174
But as the only inhabitants of
the area.

497
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:54.350
there was still an eye of
suspicion on the local people.

498
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.355
As early theories emerged.
investigators were interested

499
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.047
in a rumor that the
hikers may have stumbled

500
00:37:02.081 --> 00:37:04.187
onto a sacred Mansi site

501
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:07.086
and paid a heavy price for their
trespass.

502
00:37:08.295 --> 00:37:10.711
And when the hikers tent was
discovered.

503
00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:14.266
it was the strange cut marks
that thrust further suspicion

504
00:37:14.301 --> 00:37:15.681
on the Mansi people.

505
00:37:16.544 --> 00:37:19.340
- [Narrator] Criminal
prosecutor Lev Ivanov.

506
00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:20.548
"It was established.

507
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:22.861
the group suddenly left the tent

508
00:37:22.895 --> 00:37:25.139
and there is a reason
to believe that the tent

509
00:37:25.173 --> 00:37:26.727
was cut by someone.

510
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:30.455
Establishing if the tent
was cut or torn apart

511
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:32.250
is essential to the case."

512
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.496
- We know that the first
theory of Ivanov was murder.

513
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:41.189
He later said that the
students could be scared

514
00:37:41.224 --> 00:37:46.229
or forced off the tent only
by the group of armed people.

515
00:37:47.886 --> 00:37:50.958
at least nine of them should be
there.

516
00:37:50.992 --> 00:37:53.512
As the forensic investigation
continued.

517
00:37:53.547 --> 00:37:56.998
members of a nearby Mansi
family. the Bakhtiyarovs.

518
00:37:57.033 --> 00:38:00.588
were summoned for questioning
about their sacred practices.

519
00:38:20.367 --> 00:38:22.610
- [Liam] However. when the
forensic report

520
00:38:22.645 --> 00:38:26.856
on the tent came in. it
revealed a shocking discovery.

521
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.065
It was indeed cut by a blade.

522
00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:31.654
but astonishingly. the
report said it was cut

523
00:38:31.688 --> 00:38:33.241
from the inside.

524
00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:36.969
The experts now believe
the panicked tourists

525
00:38:37.004 --> 00:38:39.420
cut their own way out of the
tent.

526
00:38:39.455 --> 00:38:40.594
It was then unlikely

527
00:38:40.628 --> 00:38:44.356
that anyone was attacking
them from the outside.

528
00:38:44.391 --> 00:38:47.359
So the investigation into
the local Mansi people

529
00:38:47.394 --> 00:38:48.429
was dropped.

530
00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:52.295
Lev Ivanov and his team were now
left

531
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.746
with more questions than
answers.

532
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.576
Just what were the hikers
fleeing from?

533
00:39:06.033 --> 00:39:08.829
Our journey has taken
us deep into the Urals.

534
00:39:08.863 --> 00:39:12.039
many miles away from the nearest
town.

535
00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:16.975
Home for the night will
be the hunting cabin

536
00:39:17.009 --> 00:39:19.460
owned by the Mansi we met
earlier today.

537
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.981
We settle down for the
night on the hard floor

538
00:39:23.015 --> 00:39:25.915
and I'm thankful for the
warmth of this cabin.

539
00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:30.057
60 years ago. the Dyatlov
team didn't have this luxury

540
00:39:30.091 --> 00:39:33.060
as they recorded their
penultimate diary entry.

541
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.374
- [Liam] Today. we make the
journey to the Dyatlov Pass.

542
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.239
But of course. nothing is
guaranteed in the mountains.

543
00:40:28.115 --> 00:40:29.599
- [Liam] So it could be quite
different?

544
00:40:34.777 --> 00:40:37.780
- How difficult is the journey
today?

545
00:40:43.855 --> 00:40:45.857
- We might fall off today?

546
00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:54.279
- What started out as a little
more

547
00:40:54.313 --> 00:40:57.662
than a Google search has led
me halfway around the world.

548
00:40:59.595 --> 00:41:02.356
Exploring this desolate and
beautiful land

549
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.083
so far removed from my modern
day life.

550
00:41:05.117 --> 00:41:07.637
brings me closer to Dyatlov and
his team

551
00:41:07.672 --> 00:41:09.467
than I ever thought possible.

552
00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:13.229
I'm beginning to understand
why they came here.

553
00:41:13.263 --> 00:41:15.714
To challenge themselves
physically.

554
00:41:15.749 --> 00:41:18.096
to overcome the hardships.

555
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.478
and to explore the unknown.

556
00:41:28.071 --> 00:41:31.316
Frustratingly. we've come
as far as we can today.

557
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.561
The fresh snow is too deep
and soft for our snowmobiles.

558
00:41:38.703 --> 00:41:40.463
So we're about a kilometer away

559
00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:43.535
from the Dyatlov Pass tent site.

560
00:41:44.778 --> 00:41:46.814
We couldn't take the
snowmobiles any closer

561
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:51.785
because this fresh snow.
it's very sloping track.

562
00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:55.374
And these are just too
heavy for the snowmobiles.

563
00:41:55.409 --> 00:41:57.722
So we're gonna make a
base camp here tonight

564
00:41:57.756 --> 00:42:01.208
and we can make the rest of
the way on the snowmobiles

565
00:42:01.242 --> 00:42:02.347
without the trolleys.

566
00:42:03.486 --> 00:42:05.868
Hard work.

567
00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:18.018
As we settle in for the night.

568
00:42:18.052 --> 00:42:19.744
the team reminds me of perhaps

569
00:42:19.778 --> 00:42:21.642
one of the more bizarre theories

570
00:42:21.677 --> 00:42:24.334
that gained sensationalist
attention.

571
00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:25.784
- Go to forest.

572
00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:28.960
- [Liam] The Russian Yeti.

573
00:42:30.168 --> 00:42:33.240
The hikers created a peculiar
document in the style

574
00:42:33.274 --> 00:42:37.831
of a newspaper front page
called the Evening Otorten.

575
00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:41.144
A transcribed copy was
included in the case files.

576
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:44.216
And one headline caused
a greater sensation

577
00:42:44.251 --> 00:42:47.219
than the hikers could have ever
imagined.

578
00:42:47.254 --> 00:42:48.393
- [Narrator] "In the recent
years.

579
00:42:48.427 --> 00:42:52.570
there has been a heated debate
about the existence of Yeti.

580
00:42:52.604 --> 00:42:54.261
According to the recent reports.

581
00:42:54.295 --> 00:42:59.369
Yeti lives in the Northern
Urals near Otorten mountain."

582
00:42:59.404 --> 00:43:01.717
- [Liam] And with a
few out of focus photos

583
00:43:01.751 --> 00:43:04.720
on the team's camera. a legend
was born.

584
00:43:06.169 --> 00:43:09.000
- With this particular case for
Yeti.

585
00:43:09.034 --> 00:43:14.039
it's all about
misinterpretations
of the cultural thing.

586
00:43:16.628 --> 00:43:20.011
It was entirely humoristic.

587
00:43:20.045 --> 00:43:23.117
It was about making fun of each
other.

588
00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:24.878
And it's about picture.

589
00:43:24.912 --> 00:43:28.571
If you look through all
the pictures in this role.

590
00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:33.265
all the film. it's obvious
that this blurred picture

591
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.028
of the last one is one of
the many in their roll.

592
00:43:40.825 --> 00:43:43.862
- [Liam] As members of the
backup team arrive at base camp.

593
00:43:43.897 --> 00:43:45.623
we settle in for the night.

594
00:43:45.657 --> 00:43:48.626
hopefully free from any wild
beast.

595
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.905
oblivious. to the more
real dangers of the storm

596
00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:53.009
heading our way.

597
00:44:02.156 --> 00:44:04.227
- [Narrator] Diary entry. Igor
Dyatlov.

598
00:44:50.584 --> 00:44:51.723
- [Liam] Dyatlov's word.

599
00:44:51.758 --> 00:44:54.105
would be the very last left by
the group.

600
00:44:55.106 --> 00:44:58.730
His diary seems to foreshadow
the terrible events to come.

601
00:45:00.456 --> 00:45:02.941
The following day. the
team left a cache of food

602
00:45:02.976 --> 00:45:06.462
and equipment for their return
journey to Mount Otorten.

603
00:45:07.912 --> 00:45:09.258
The worsening weather

604
00:45:09.292 --> 00:45:11.467
and deep snow forced them to
build a camp

605
00:45:11.501 --> 00:45:13.780
after traveling only a mile and
a half

606
00:45:13.814 --> 00:45:17.300
on to Mount Kholat-Syakhl.
the Dead Mountain.

607
00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:22.581
Before morning. all nine
friends would be dead.

608
00:45:26.275 --> 00:45:30.520
- When the group failed to
come back to Yekaterinburg

609
00:45:30.555 --> 00:45:35.560
on the 12th of February. no
one was immediately alarmed.

610
00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:41.255
The first person who was
alarmed was Rimma Kolevatov

611
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.119
the sister of Sasha Kolevatov.

612
00:45:43.154 --> 00:45:45.501
And she started to make
telephone calls

613
00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:49.712
to the Explorers Clubs. to the
university.

614
00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:52.991
- [Liam] It wasn't until
February 21st.

615
00:45:53.026 --> 00:45:55.822
over a week after the hikers
were due to have sent word

616
00:45:55.856 --> 00:45:57.064
of their return.

617
00:45:57.099 --> 00:46:00.688
that the first teams of
search parties were deployed.

618
00:46:00.723 --> 00:46:02.449
However. with only a rough idea

619
00:46:02.483 --> 00:46:04.623
of the team's expected location.

620
00:46:04.658 --> 00:46:07.316
it would prove to be a difficult
task.

621
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.836
The search teams comprised
of professionals.

622
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.183
military and fellow student
members

623
00:46:12.217 --> 00:46:15.255
of the university's Explorers
Club.

624
00:46:15.289 --> 00:46:18.914
For those friends. this
was still a rescue mission.

625
00:46:20.363 --> 00:46:22.780
Evgeniy was a member
of another hiking team

626
00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:24.678
in a similar area.

627
00:46:24.712 --> 00:46:27.474
His and Dyatlov's teams
were expecting to connect

628
00:46:27.508 --> 00:46:29.200
on their return journey.

629
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:53.845
An aerial search was conducted
along with multiple teams

630
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.468
on the ground. and it
would take several days

631
00:46:56.503 --> 00:47:00.127
before the rescue has
got their first clue.

632
00:47:00.162 --> 00:47:02.543
The hikers partially snow
covered tent.

633
00:47:04.235 --> 00:47:07.617
Officially. the tent was
found on February the 26th

634
00:47:07.652 --> 00:47:10.413
by fellow student hikers. Boris
Slobstov

635
00:47:10.448 --> 00:47:11.483
and Mikhail Sharavin.

636
00:47:12.381 --> 00:47:15.039
They were accompanied by
a local forestry worker.

637
00:47:15.073 --> 00:47:19.112
Ivan Pashin. who lived and
worked alongside the Mansi
people

638
00:47:19.146 --> 00:47:20.147
in the region.

639
00:47:21.045 --> 00:47:24.427
However. Pashin later
stated in his testimony.

640
00:47:44.965 --> 00:47:46.415
- [Liam] This statement was
backed up

641
00:47:46.449 --> 00:47:49.383
by his friend and fellow
search team member. Cheglakov.

642
00:47:58.254 --> 00:47:59.773
- [Liam] It's incredible to me

643
00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:02.051
that these two men did not look
inside

644
00:48:02.086 --> 00:48:06.469
for any signs of the hikers or
perhaps even more incredible.

645
00:48:06.504 --> 00:48:09.887
that they didn't report such
a huge finding right away.

646
00:48:10.749 --> 00:48:13.028
Officially. it would take two
more days

647
00:48:13.062 --> 00:48:15.030
of aerial and ground searches

648
00:48:15.064 --> 00:48:18.585
before Slobstov and Sharavin
accompanied by Pashin.

649
00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:21.553
spotted the tent on Mount
Kholat-Syakhl.

650
00:48:21.588 --> 00:48:23.210
As they ascended the mountain.

651
00:48:23.245 --> 00:48:25.730
Pashin refused to go with them.

652
00:48:28.146 --> 00:48:30.217
- For me. it speaks for the fact

653
00:48:30.252 --> 00:48:34.946
that he has already heard
something from the Mansi.

654
00:48:34.981 --> 00:48:37.742
That something happened on the
slope

655
00:48:37.776 --> 00:48:41.884
but he felt like it's better
to stay away from this matter.

656
00:48:42.885 --> 00:48:45.439
They had also their traditions

657
00:48:45.474 --> 00:48:48.960
and they didn't want
anyone to mess with that.

658
00:48:48.995 --> 00:48:50.997
- [Liam] As they approached
their friend's tent.

659
00:48:51.031 --> 00:48:54.690
it quickly became apparent
that this was an unusual scene.

660
00:48:55.587 --> 00:48:58.211
Along with the flashlight
found on top of the snow.

661
00:48:58.245 --> 00:49:02.042
what they found left
inside was more worrying.

662
00:49:17.782 --> 00:49:19.577
- [Liam] With no trace of the
hikers.

663
00:49:19.611 --> 00:49:22.925
finding their winter clothes
and boots was unnerving.

664
00:49:23.995 --> 00:49:25.100
The following day.

665
00:49:25.134 --> 00:49:29.000
the search parties focused their
attention on the tent site.

666
00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:30.450
And further down the slope.

667
00:49:30.484 --> 00:49:32.797
the rescuers found their next
clue.

668
00:49:54.853 --> 00:49:56.441
- [Liam] Later stories would
suggest

669
00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:58.167
that the hikers fled in a panic

670
00:49:58.202 --> 00:50:00.135
from some terrifying event.

671
00:50:00.169 --> 00:50:02.654
But the footsteps as seen by
Slobstov

672
00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:04.794
clearly show how the hikers
walked

673
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:08.177
or marched side by side.
away from the tent.

674
00:50:09.213 --> 00:50:11.836
The searches followed the
partially visible tracks

675
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.494
down the slope where the team
uncovered

676
00:50:14.528 --> 00:50:16.875
their first grisly discovery.

677
00:50:17.704 --> 00:50:20.983
The bodies of Krivonischenko
and Doroshenko

678
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:22.778
were found under a cedar tree

679
00:50:22.812 --> 00:50:24.849
nearly a mile away from the
tent.

680
00:50:26.092 --> 00:50:27.196
Evgeniy Maslennikov.

681
00:50:27.231 --> 00:50:30.268
head of the university sports
club wrote:

682
00:50:57.019 --> 00:50:58.020
- [Liam] Later that same day.

683
00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:00.678
a thousand feet away from the
cedar tree.

684
00:51:00.712 --> 00:51:03.474
the team made another grim
discovery.

685
00:51:03.508 --> 00:51:07.064
The frozen body of group
leader. Igor Dyatlov.

686
00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:10.688
He had collapsed around a small
birch tree

687
00:51:10.722 --> 00:51:12.379
facing towards the tent.

688
00:51:12.414 --> 00:51:14.933
suggesting that he was
attempting to return.

689
00:51:46.965 --> 00:51:49.175
- [Liam] Finding the
bodies of the four hikers

690
00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:52.143
was a devastating blow
to the rescue party.

691
00:52:18.928 --> 00:52:19.929
In the following days.

692
00:52:19.964 --> 00:52:22.967
the search teams painstakingly
probe the deep snow

693
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:25.487
for any signs of their comrades.

694
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.592
On March 5th. six long days

695
00:52:27.627 --> 00:52:30.388
after the discovery of
the first four bodies.

696
00:52:30.423 --> 00:52:33.943
the searches uncovered
another. Rustem Slobodin.

697
00:52:35.738 --> 00:52:38.776
He too was found facing in
the direction of the tent.

698
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.986
suggesting he was also trying
to make a desperate return

699
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.195
to shelter and warm clothing.

700
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:47.509
All five of the hikers found so
far

701
00:52:47.543 --> 00:52:49.649
were flown to Ivdel for autopsy.

702
00:52:50.684 --> 00:52:52.928
The searcher's grim task
continued

703
00:52:52.962 --> 00:52:56.311
and the days turned into
weeks with no new clues

704
00:52:56.345 --> 00:52:59.797
as to where the remaining
four hikers could be.

705
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.214
[gentle music]

706
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.397
In a bizarre parallel
to Dyatlov's journey.

707
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:15.537
our own expedition has been hit

708
00:53:15.571 --> 00:53:19.023
by a savage blizzard and the
dangerous drop in temperature

709
00:53:19.057 --> 00:53:21.474
on the day we were due
to make it to the Pass.

710
00:54:02.963 --> 00:54:05.690
[dramatic music]

711
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.505
Nature calls the shots out
here

712
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.611
and to try to make to the Pass
today

713
00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:31.889
would be far too dangerous.

714
00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:41.657
The autopsy of the five
hikers was conducted in Ivdel

715
00:54:41.692 --> 00:54:45.247
by forensic medical expert.
Vozrozhdenny.

716
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.319
Doroshenko. Krivonischenko.
Dyatlov.

717
00:54:48.354 --> 00:54:51.046
Kolmogorova and Slobodin.

718
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.014
were all found to have suffered
various cuts and bruises

719
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:55.395
to the body.

720
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.088
Specific injuries included
bruising cuts and abrasions

721
00:54:59.123 --> 00:55:01.781
to the nose. eyebrows and
cheeks.

722
00:55:02.713 --> 00:55:05.785
Further bruising and abrasions
were found on the knuckles

723
00:55:05.819 --> 00:55:08.097
and the back of the hands.

724
00:55:08.132 --> 00:55:11.100
Yet. under close watch
from the party officials.

725
00:55:11.135 --> 00:55:13.896
Vozrozhdenny concluded
that all of these injuries

726
00:55:13.931 --> 00:55:16.934
were simply as a result of
falling over.

727
00:55:16.968 --> 00:55:19.868
The official cause of death for
all five

728
00:55:19.902 --> 00:55:22.042
was stated as hypothermia.

729
00:55:24.838 --> 00:55:28.601
- Today. if you see a guy. if
you see his upper lip swollen.

730
00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:30.154
a black eye.

731
00:55:30.188 --> 00:55:33.951
and his fists scabbed over.

732
00:55:33.985 --> 00:55:35.642
Do you think that he panicked

733
00:55:35.677 --> 00:55:40.371
and he ran really fast
and he threw himself

734
00:55:40.406 --> 00:55:41.993
against the rocks?

735
00:55:42.028 --> 00:55:45.997
No. your first thought
is there must be a fight.

736
00:55:48.137 --> 00:55:50.381
- [Liam] A rumor spread
that perhaps the group

737
00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:52.245
turned on themselves.

738
00:55:52.279 --> 00:55:55.352
Investigator Ivanov feared
that the party leaders

739
00:55:55.386 --> 00:55:58.907
would use this to cover up the
truth of the investigation.

740
00:55:58.941 --> 00:56:01.634
Something he wasn't
prepared to let happen.

741
00:56:50.061 --> 00:56:52.719
In an effort to divert
the growing attention.

742
00:56:52.754 --> 00:56:55.619
the officials attempted
to quietly bury the hikers

743
00:56:55.653 --> 00:56:59.174
hundreds of miles away
from their home city.

744
00:56:59.208 --> 00:57:01.935
This only fueled conspiracy
theories.

745
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.006
And under mounting public
pressure.

746
00:57:04.041 --> 00:57:07.009
the officials were forced
to return the hikers home.

747
00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:09.149
- Back in the city.

748
00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:13.360
the people try to make
sense of what have happened.

749
00:57:13.395 --> 00:57:17.813
They questioned military
authorities.

750
00:57:17.848 --> 00:57:20.298
Why. how come. what could be?

751
00:57:20.333 --> 00:57:23.129
In the middle of nowhere.
why would they die?

752
00:57:24.475 --> 00:57:27.340
And the funerals. they were just
huge.

753
00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:30.964
Just exactly what the
authority wanted to prevent.

754
00:57:30.999 --> 00:57:32.241
it happened.

755
00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:36.073
There were thousands
and thousands of people

756
00:57:36.107 --> 00:57:38.558
who attended during the funeral.

757
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:40.595
- [Liam] Those that were there

758
00:57:40.629 --> 00:57:43.287
remember being watched by the
KGB.

759
00:57:43.321 --> 00:57:46.532
stoking fears that the
military were to blame.

760
00:57:46.566 --> 00:57:50.432
Rumors of unusual lights in
the sky. strange photographs

761
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.849
and secret military tests began
to spread.

762
00:57:56.438 --> 00:57:58.923
Vladislav Karelin and his team
were hiking

763
00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:01.857
in the Urals not far from the
Dyatlov Pass

764
00:58:01.892 --> 00:58:04.273
only two weeks after the tragedy

765
00:58:04.308 --> 00:58:08.623
when they themselves witnessed
an unusual celestial event.

766
00:58:47.834 --> 00:58:50.147
Could Karelin sighting prove the
hikers

767
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:54.358
controversial photo was
in fact a real object.

768
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:17.174
Given the sightings in 1959.

769
00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:19.832
many involved with the Dyatlov
Foundation.

770
00:59:19.866 --> 00:59:23.939
believe the military rocket
theory is the most plausible.

771
00:59:35.986 --> 00:59:39.368
Yet Karelin's own team
also witnessed these lights

772
00:59:39.403 --> 00:59:41.336
but it certainly didn't scare
them

773
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.649
from fleeing the safety of their
tent.

774
00:59:44.995 --> 00:59:47.653
- Well. I don't believe
there could be a rocket

775
00:59:47.687 --> 00:59:51.311
or military experiment
that injured the hikers.

776
00:59:51.346 --> 00:59:54.107
Well. definitely there was
something going on in the sky

777
00:59:54.142 --> 00:59:56.178
at that period of time.

778
00:59:56.213 --> 00:59:59.734
The event was pretty far from
them

779
00:59:59.768 --> 01:00:02.184
Since they were capable
of taking pictures.

780
01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:06.568
And it lasted at least one. two
minutes.

781
01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:11.159
It means. it was not threatening
to them.

782
01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:15.784
Certainly. the autopsy reports
from the first five hikers

783
01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:19.616
showed no obvious signs of
injury from a missile blast

784
01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:24.137
nor were there any signs of an
explosion or debris reported

785
01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:25.656
by the search teams.

786
01:00:26.968 --> 01:00:29.867
With this frustratingly
conflicting evidence.

787
01:00:29.902 --> 01:00:32.663
the investigators could
only hope that finding

788
01:00:32.698 --> 01:00:36.184
the last four hikers
would unravel the mystery.

789
01:00:39.118 --> 01:00:41.776
[upbeat music]

790
01:00:49.335 --> 01:00:52.752
Three months after the incident
and the melting snows led

791
01:00:52.787 --> 01:00:54.616
to a breakthrough.

792
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.307
Mansi native Kurikov.

793
01:00:56.342 --> 01:00:57.826
spotted some cut branches.

794
01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:00.587
only 150 feet from the cedar
tree

795
01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:03.073
that seemed to form a trail.

796
01:01:03.107 --> 01:01:04.143
Along with his dog.

797
01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:06.317
he discovered the remains of
some clothing

798
01:01:06.352 --> 01:01:08.457
which appeared to be cut by a
knife.

799
01:01:09.424 --> 01:01:12.185
The search team swiftly
focused in on the area

800
01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.635
and began to dig.

801
01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.949
Buried under more than 10 feet
of snow.

802
01:01:16.983 --> 01:01:18.467
they found a small den.

803
01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:22.713
Cut branches were laid
to make a makeshift floor

804
01:01:22.748 --> 01:01:25.785
but there was no sign of the
hikers.

805
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.719
Fellow student hiker. Vladimir
Askinadzi.

806
01:01:28.754 --> 01:01:30.721
was one of the students tasked

807
01:01:30.756 --> 01:01:34.691
with probing the area
to look for his friends.

808
01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.796
Buried 12 feet under the snow.

809
01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:13.626
was the body of Lyudmila
Dubinina.

810
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.697
She was found in a small ravine.

811
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.044
collapsed over a natural ledge.

812
01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:19.597
The three remaining bodies

813
01:02:19.632 --> 01:02:21.530
of Kolevatov. Thibeaux. and
Zolotaryov

814
01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:24.533
were found close to Dubinina.

815
01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:27.467
They lay next to each other.

816
01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:29.331
perhaps in a desperate attempt

817
01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:32.093
to share body warmth
in their final moments.

818
01:02:57.843 --> 01:03:00.500
The bodies were carefully
removed and carried back

819
01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:02.468
to the evacuation point.

820
01:03:02.502 --> 01:03:04.332
but the fears of military tests

821
01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:08.267
and possible radiation
contamination was rife.

822
01:03:08.301 --> 01:03:10.510
The helicopter pilots fearing
the risk

823
01:03:10.545 --> 01:03:12.098
of radiation poisoning.

824
01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:15.446
refused to transport the
bodies until they were placed

825
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:17.586
in zinc lined cases.

826
01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:20.797
The move suggested that
even senior officials

827
01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.591
were growing suspicious.

828
01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:26.733
And the autopsy was about to
reveal

829
01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:29.667
some grim and unexpected
details.

830
01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:33.395
Thibeaux. although found dressed
warmer

831
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:36.743
than the first five hikers
had suffered a mysterious

832
01:03:36.778 --> 01:03:40.575
and devastating blow to
the right side of his head.

833
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:05.876
- [Liam] The examiners
found that Kolevatov

834
01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:07.705
was also dressed reasonably well

835
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.364
against the elements with
ski jacket and pants.

836
01:04:11.399 --> 01:04:13.159
However. his boots were missing.

837
01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:16.714
and he too had some unusual
injuries.

838
01:04:27.173 --> 01:04:29.658
- [Liam] The examiner
seemed to make little effort

839
01:04:29.693 --> 01:04:33.007
to better understand the
cause of these injuries.

840
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:36.769
Officially. he stated that they
died from freezing to death.

841
01:04:36.803 --> 01:04:39.461
Still. the mystery only
deepened.

842
01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:43.880
Zolotaryov. the oldest of
the team was again found

843
01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:47.814
with a basic level of clothing.
under layers. ski pants

844
01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:50.507
and a jacket with the
upper buttons undone.

845
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.511
The examiner noted the
horrific facial decay

846
01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:57.997
presumably from the
stream he was found in.

847
01:04:58.032 --> 01:05:00.931
But it was the unexplained
crushing impact

848
01:05:00.966 --> 01:05:04.555
to Zolotaryov's chest
that was most unusual.

849
01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:26.301
- [Liam] Lyuda wore ski pants

850
01:05:26.336 --> 01:05:29.856
which were badly fire
damaged and two sweaters.

851
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.375
Missing her snow boots.

852
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:35.517
she had desperately wrapped a
torn sweater around her feet.

853
01:05:35.552 --> 01:05:39.383
She was found lying face down
in a stream of melting snow.

854
01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:41.282
The examiner stated this caused

855
01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:46.218
the horrific decaying facial
tissue and her missing eyes.

856
01:05:46.252 --> 01:05:50.291
Incredibly. he also noted
that her tongue was missing

857
01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:54.191
without any further explanation
as to why.

858
01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:57.746
Shockingly. there was a
similar finding to Zolotaryov.

859
01:05:57.781 --> 01:06:00.853
Lyuda suffered a brutal
impact to her chest.

860
01:06:00.887 --> 01:06:02.406
fracturing multiple ribs

861
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:06.583
and was powerful enough
to puncture her heart.

862
01:06:26.534 --> 01:06:29.882
- [Liam] The forensic examiner's
confounding conclusions

863
01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:31.988
did little to explain the
tragedy

864
01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:35.163
and only raised more questions.

865
01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:38.615
Lead investigator Ivanov
have had little to work on.

866
01:06:38.649 --> 01:06:41.135
And given the speculation
of military tests.

867
01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:44.103
he ordered the students
clothes to be tested

868
01:06:44.138 --> 01:06:45.553
for radioactivity.

869
01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:49.350
Incredibly. some of
those found in the ravine

870
01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:52.491
showed above normal levels of
radiation.

871
01:06:55.287 --> 01:06:58.462
For Ivanov. there was no
obvious answer in sight.

872
01:06:59.636 --> 01:07:02.225
As the whispers of rocket.
military tests

873
01:07:02.259 --> 01:07:04.365
and now radiation spread.

874
01:07:04.399 --> 01:07:07.609
the investigation was
seemingly out of control.

875
01:07:08.783 --> 01:07:10.681
The Soviet government frustrated

876
01:07:10.716 --> 01:07:13.443
and unable to curb the
rumors that implicated

877
01:07:13.477 --> 01:07:17.619
their own military. summoned
Ivanov back to headquarters

878
01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:20.346
and ordered that the case be
closed.

879
01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:56.382
- No further investigation
was carried out.

880
01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:58.695
The strange circumstances and
injuries

881
01:07:58.729 --> 01:08:00.593
simply left unexplained.

882
01:08:02.664 --> 01:08:04.942
Now. the case files hidden until
the fall

883
01:08:04.977 --> 01:08:09.188
of the Soviet Union will be the
key to uncovering the truth.

884
01:08:15.298 --> 01:08:17.748
[soft music]

885
01:08:28.552 --> 01:08:30.830
We've traveled nearly 100 miles.

886
01:08:30.865 --> 01:08:34.110
and we're just a few miles
from the Dyatlov Pass.

887
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.183
Our expedition was forced
to camp for the night

888
01:08:38.217 --> 01:08:41.082
and take shelter from a brutal
storm.

889
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.257
The worst seems to have passed.

890
01:08:43.291 --> 01:08:44.741
but today's challenge

891
01:08:44.775 --> 01:08:46.984
will be to navigate the deep
snow.

892
01:08:48.503 --> 01:08:50.264
It's snowing quite a lot.

893
01:08:50.298 --> 01:08:52.576
And I know they're concerned
about the safety of us

894
01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:54.889
getting to the Pass

895
01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.650
yesterday. I don't think it's
gonna get any easier today.

896
01:08:57.685 --> 01:08:58.996
I'm determined to get there.

897
01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:01.930
So we'll take the snowmobiles
as far as we can go.

898
01:09:01.965 --> 01:09:04.623
And then we'll hike the rest of
the way.

899
01:09:04.657 --> 01:09:08.144
[intense dramatic music]

900
01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:11.837
The heavy snow on the mountain
is making it difficult

901
01:09:11.871 --> 01:09:15.289
for the snowmobiles to
stay upright or avoid rocks

902
01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:18.637
lurking deceptively
just below the surface.

903
01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:22.158
Even a small injury out
here could prove deadly.

904
01:09:30.718 --> 01:09:33.099
This is our first steep
slope we had come up.

905
01:09:33.134 --> 01:09:34.791
It was a bit too steep for two
people.

906
01:09:34.825 --> 01:09:37.000
So we'll walk the rest of the
way.

907
01:09:37.034 --> 01:09:39.209
I think it's gonna be a
lot more of that today.

908
01:09:39.244 --> 01:09:40.900
This is tough conditions.

909
01:09:46.043 --> 01:09:48.149
Leaving the snowmobiles behind.

910
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.393
we make the rest of the journey
on foot.

911
01:09:51.601 --> 01:09:53.913
Traveling a relatively short
distance

912
01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:55.536
of just a couple of miles

913
01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:58.884
in this deep snow is
incredibly slow going.

914
01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:03.716
Finally. through the thickening
skies.

915
01:10:03.751 --> 01:10:06.029
the boot rock comes into view.

916
01:10:07.272 --> 01:10:12.000
This was the landing area for
the search teams back in 1959.

917
01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:22.563
It's truly an incredible
experience for me.

918
01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:25.911
I can hardly believe
I've journeyed this far.

919
01:10:25.945 --> 01:10:28.948
and I'm almost at the very
location

920
01:10:28.983 --> 01:10:30.640
of the Dyatlov Pass incident.

921
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.922
The names of the nine
hikers that died here

922
01:10:36.956 --> 01:10:41.961
on February the 3rd. 1959.
will forever be remembered

923
01:10:42.445 --> 01:10:45.171
in this beautiful yet desolate
place.

924
01:10:49.452 --> 01:10:52.282
We still have a tough walk ahead
of us

925
01:10:52.317 --> 01:10:55.665
but I'm determined to make
it to the actual location

926
01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:58.875
where the Dyatlov group tent was
found.

927
01:10:58.909 --> 01:11:02.361
So we push on into darkening
skies.

928
01:11:04.225 --> 01:11:05.433
My journey has led me

929
01:11:05.468 --> 01:11:09.299
through many incredible
theories on this case.

930
01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:12.509
And perhaps. the most shocking
is about to be revealed.

931
01:11:36.015 --> 01:11:39.156
Sakharova has studied
the documents extensively

932
01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:42.988
and found a number of problems
starting with the tent.

933
01:11:43.022 --> 01:11:45.956
The expert's opinions
at the time suggested

934
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:50.202
that the tent was cut from
the inside by the hikers.

935
01:11:50.236 --> 01:11:54.240
This fact was instrumental in
leading the investigators away

936
01:11:54.275 --> 01:11:57.174
from any theory that the
hikers may have been attacked.

937
01:12:48.087 --> 01:12:50.400
If the findings from the tent
examination

938
01:12:50.435 --> 01:12:53.023
led the investigators away from
the theory

939
01:12:53.058 --> 01:12:55.371
that the hikers may have been
attacked.

940
01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:58.235
that may have also clouded
their interpretation

941
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.547
of later evidence.

942
01:13:25.746 --> 01:13:27.989
If Sakharova is right.

943
01:13:28.024 --> 01:13:30.406
then the proof that the
hikers were murdered

944
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.030
may well be right here
in the autopsy reports

945
01:13:34.064 --> 01:13:35.963
hidden in plain sight

946
01:13:37.067 --> 01:13:40.208
but I'm going to need some
help to decipher the clues.

947
01:13:47.043 --> 01:13:48.458
- My name is Ken Holmes

948
01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:53.187
and I was in the Marin County
coroner's office for 36 years.

949
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:56.604
The last 12 of which I
was the elected coroner.

950
01:13:56.639 --> 01:13:59.849
And we handled all the death
investigations that occurred

951
01:13:59.883 --> 01:14:01.160
in the County of Marin.

952
01:14:02.299 --> 01:14:05.441
I believe the autopsies
probably are very thorough

953
01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.720
but I would disagree with the
accuracy

954
01:14:08.754 --> 01:14:13.552
of the conclusions for
at least seven of them.

955
01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:18.212
The amount of trauma
absolutely precludes any sort

956
01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:22.665
of accidental fall. at
least from their own height.

957
01:14:22.699 --> 01:14:24.943
Certainly not just
walking along in the snow

958
01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:25.978
and falling down.

959
01:14:26.013 --> 01:14:29.465
It appears that the officials
involved

960
01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:32.122
at the time of the autopsies.

961
01:14:32.157 --> 01:14:35.609
basically tried to sweep this
entire thing under the rug

962
01:14:35.643 --> 01:14:40.372
trying to make it look like
some unfortunate accident.

963
01:14:40.406 --> 01:14:43.237
[dramatic music]

964
01:14:47.931 --> 01:14:49.070
- My name is Mick Fennerty.

965
01:14:49.105 --> 01:14:52.971
I'm retired special agent with
the FBI.

966
01:14:53.005 --> 01:14:57.976
And spent just over 20
years working for the FBI.

967
01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.289
And I spent almost 15 years
total

968
01:15:01.324 --> 01:15:03.084
on our evidence response team.

969
01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:04.085
The team responsible

970
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.331
for investigating our
more complex crime scenes.

971
01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:12.266
Many cases are filled with
strange things.

972
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.856
But yeah. this one has several.

973
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:18.341
If you look at the simplest
explanation.

974
01:15:21.586 --> 01:15:23.070
the principal of Occam's razor

975
01:15:23.104 --> 01:15:25.900
that the most simple answer

976
01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:28.420
is often the most correct
answer.

977
01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:30.629
Hikers were forced out of their
tent.

978
01:15:30.664 --> 01:15:33.149
I mean. you just can't explain

979
01:15:33.183 --> 01:15:35.427
why they would leave their
boots.

980
01:15:36.877 --> 01:15:40.156
unless they were forced out into
the cold.

981
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:42.745
Why they didn't immediately
return to the tent

982
01:15:42.779 --> 01:15:46.542
knowing that they were
gonna die of exposure

983
01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:48.923
out in the cold without boots.

984
01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:55.447
When you look at the wounds
that were on the hikers.

985
01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:57.829
I'm just not buying the
accidental thing.

986
01:15:58.968 --> 01:16:00.107
this was a homicide.

987
01:16:01.902 --> 01:16:04.732
[dramatic music]

988
01:16:10.427 --> 01:16:13.085
- These new experts have all
suggested

989
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.089
that what happened to
Dyatlov's team was no accident.

990
01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:20.679
So we know that both
Lyudmila and Zolotaryov.

991
01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:24.856
both suffered bone crushing
injuries to the chest.

992
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:26.512
And given the position of the
bodies.

993
01:16:26.547 --> 01:16:28.791
we know it couldn't have
come from the same impact.

994
01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:33.450
- My thinking is that he was
laying down maybe on his back

995
01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:37.213
and something very. very
heavy dropped across him.

996
01:16:37.247 --> 01:16:40.112
Could have been someone stepping
on him or stomping on him.

997
01:16:40.147 --> 01:16:41.976
Certainly possible.

998
01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:45.014
The interesting thing is
that the rib fractures

999
01:16:45.048 --> 01:16:45.877
are all very high.

1000
01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:48.224
They start right underneath the
collarbone

1001
01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:50.260
and only go about halfway down

1002
01:16:50.295 --> 01:16:53.367
which is not typical of somebody
falling down on their own

1003
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:56.163
or falling against rocks or a
log.

1004
01:16:56.197 --> 01:16:59.856
So it's more likely that he was
stationary

1005
01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:02.376
and something heavy came down
upon him.

1006
01:17:03.549 --> 01:17:04.723
- [Liam] Lyudmila suffered
similar.

1007
01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:06.449
but more devastating injuries.

1008
01:17:06.483 --> 01:17:07.588
- The rib fractures.

1009
01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:12.351
they were of such impact
that the ribs flexed

1010
01:17:12.386 --> 01:17:16.148
after being broken and
actually punctured the heart.

1011
01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:20.843
That takes an incredible blow.

1012
01:17:20.877 --> 01:17:22.845
And the ones that I have seen

1013
01:17:22.879 --> 01:17:25.123
is either in a motor vehicle
accident

1014
01:17:25.157 --> 01:17:27.125
or a fall from a very high
place.

1015
01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:29.645
and I'm talking about 50 feet.

1016
01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:33.476
She didn't just trip and fall
and go down on her chest.

1017
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:37.204
something very. very
heavy fell against her.

1018
01:17:37.238 --> 01:17:38.861
Could one person do that?

1019
01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:42.174
Yes. but again. it would
take a pretty hefty person.

1020
01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:43.693
If they were doing it on their
own.

1021
01:17:43.728 --> 01:17:46.385
they would be probably jumping

1022
01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.941
or throwing themselves against
her.

1023
01:17:49.975 --> 01:17:53.047
- Lyudmila was missing her
eyeballs and her tongue.

1024
01:17:53.082 --> 01:17:54.221
The autopsy report said

1025
01:17:54.255 --> 01:17:56.775
this was because she was
laying face down in a stream

1026
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.294
underneath the snow.

1027
01:17:58.328 --> 01:18:02.194
Now that may attribute the
soft tissue damage to her eyes

1028
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:03.920
but the tongue is much bigger
muscle.

1029
01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:06.060
To me. that seems strange.

1030
01:18:23.043 --> 01:18:26.322
Thibeaux was found in the
same stream as these two.

1031
01:18:26.356 --> 01:18:29.532
except he had a massive
fracture to his right temple.

1032
01:18:29.566 --> 01:18:32.984
Even the autopsy report
said it was highly unlikely

1033
01:18:33.018 --> 01:18:35.883
he could have suffered this
injury simply from falling over.

1034
01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:38.092
- He easily could have been
struck.

1035
01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:41.647
The kind of blow that is
described.

1036
01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:44.685
it looks like the head was
unsupported.

1037
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.792
In other words. it wasn't on the
ground

1038
01:18:47.826 --> 01:18:52.348
where something hit his head
so that he couldn't move away.

1039
01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:54.419
- Kolevatov was the
fourth member of the team

1040
01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:56.455
to be found in the same stream.

1041
01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:58.975
Kolevatov actually suffered
a really sizable wound

1042
01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.633
behind his ear. which
is really unusual to do

1043
01:19:01.667 --> 01:19:03.911
by accidentally falling over.

1044
01:19:03.946 --> 01:19:06.534
The autopsy report also
noted that his neck

1045
01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:07.950
had been damaged.

1046
01:19:17.062 --> 01:19:20.203
The first to be found by the
cedar tree were Yuri Doroshenko

1047
01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:22.585
and Yuri Krivonischenko.

1048
01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:25.795
Doroshenko had cuts and bruises
to eyes. nose. and lips.

1049
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.348
But he also had bruising and
abrasing

1050
01:19:27.383 --> 01:19:29.799
to the inside of the arms
and into the armpits.

1051
01:19:29.834 --> 01:19:32.215
Krivonischenko. his
injuries included bruising

1052
01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:34.839
to the forehead around
the left temporal bone.

1053
01:19:34.873 --> 01:19:37.669
His knuckles and fingers
were bruised and swollen

1054
01:19:37.703 --> 01:19:40.914
and he also suffered terrible
burn to his left leg.

1055
01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:42.674
For me. what's really
strange about the injuries

1056
01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.503
to both Krivonischenko and
Doroshenko

1057
01:19:44.538 --> 01:19:47.506
was the fact that their
injuries actually weren't so bad

1058
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:49.094
with perhaps the exception of
the burn

1059
01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:50.855
to Krivonischenko's left leg.

1060
01:19:50.889 --> 01:19:53.512
What was actually stopping them
from returning to the tent?

1061
01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:00.174
Rustem Slobodin was found 500
meters

1062
01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:01.797
away from the cedar tree.

1063
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:04.592
It looked like he was heading
back towards the tent.

1064
01:20:04.627 --> 01:20:06.940
He was found with bruised
knuckles

1065
01:20:06.974 --> 01:20:09.183
as well as bruising to the face
and legs.

1066
01:20:09.218 --> 01:20:13.291
Rustem suffered a massive
fracture to the side of his
skull.

1067
01:20:30.032 --> 01:20:32.103
Rustem was probably knocked
unconscious

1068
01:20:32.137 --> 01:20:34.243
and very near to where he was
found.

1069
01:20:34.277 --> 01:20:37.418
So whatever struck him
was a very different event

1070
01:20:37.453 --> 01:20:38.972
to what happened to the others.

1071
01:20:41.457 --> 01:20:45.461
Zina was found 600 meters
away from the cedar tree.

1072
01:20:45.495 --> 01:20:48.084
She was found with bruising
all around her face.

1073
01:20:48.119 --> 01:20:51.191
Zina also suffered a 30
centimeter long bruise

1074
01:20:51.225 --> 01:20:53.469
across the back and the kidney
area.

1075
01:20:53.503 --> 01:20:55.540
which must've knocked the wind
out of her.

1076
01:20:55.574 --> 01:20:58.439
But also she had bad bruising
across both knuckles.

1077
01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:01.270
Again. was she fighting some
attackers?

1078
01:21:01.304 --> 01:21:04.273
- Well. certainly you
could make a case for that.

1079
01:21:04.307 --> 01:21:05.688
On the other hand.

1080
01:21:05.722 --> 01:21:07.655
you could also make a case

1081
01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:10.313
that over the course of
the three or four days

1082
01:21:10.348 --> 01:21:11.452
before she died.

1083
01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:15.387
she could have done it scraping
against ice accidentally.

1084
01:21:15.422 --> 01:21:19.219
I would say it looks to me
like she was defending herself

1085
01:21:19.253 --> 01:21:21.842
with some of the bruises.

1086
01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.913
but then on her knuckles.

1087
01:21:23.948 --> 01:21:26.882
that's not indicative of a
defensive wound

1088
01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:30.713
as much as it is of a
thrusting from her standpoint.

1089
01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:36.615
- Igor Dyatlov was found
lying again in the direction

1090
01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:39.480
of the tent. suggesting that
he too was trying to go back

1091
01:21:39.515 --> 01:21:40.654
for supplies.

1092
01:21:40.688 --> 01:21:42.587
As a respected group leader.

1093
01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:43.691
I don't think for a second

1094
01:21:43.726 --> 01:21:46.246
he wouldn't have done his
best to try and help himself

1095
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.626
and the team.

1096
01:21:47.661 --> 01:21:49.180
The autopsy reports stated

1097
01:21:49.214 --> 01:21:51.044
that he had bruising to his
knuckles.

1098
01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:52.493
But what's most interesting to
me

1099
01:21:52.528 --> 01:21:54.219
was he had bruising and
abrasions

1100
01:21:54.254 --> 01:21:56.428
to both his wrists and ankles

1101
01:21:57.671 --> 01:22:02.331
[Natalia speaking in foreign
language]

1102
01:22:19.796 --> 01:22:21.281
- I have tried and tried and
tried.

1103
01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:23.593
I've spent a great deal
of time trying to come up

1104
01:22:23.628 --> 01:22:28.633
with a scenario that would
cover the variety of injuries.

1105
01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.531
the spacing of the people

1106
01:22:30.566 --> 01:22:32.948
and where they're found
and how they're found.

1107
01:22:34.328 --> 01:22:39.057
It's very difficult for me
to come up with any scenario

1108
01:22:39.092 --> 01:22:44.097
other than there must have
been some other people present.

1109
01:22:45.926 --> 01:22:48.756
[dramatic music]

1110
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.386
- [Liam] Like every theory in
this case.

1111
01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.871
there always seems to be
one piece of the puzzle

1112
01:22:59.905 --> 01:23:01.597
that just doesn't fit.

1113
01:23:01.631 --> 01:23:05.118
In this case. it's the lights in
the sky.

1114
01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:07.706
Karelin and others still
believe that rockets

1115
01:23:07.741 --> 01:23:09.708
were in some way connected.

1116
01:23:09.743 --> 01:23:13.367
Yet. there's no evidence of
an explosion at the site.

1117
01:23:13.402 --> 01:23:15.576
But could some rockets
have affected the hikers

1118
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:17.026
in another way?

1119
01:23:32.628 --> 01:23:37.495
- Any volatile gas that could
have affected these people.

1120
01:23:38.737 --> 01:23:43.432
no way to prove it would be
there after such a long time

1121
01:23:43.466 --> 01:23:44.916
in the snow.

1122
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:47.056
But there didn't seem
to be any description

1123
01:23:47.091 --> 01:23:50.577
from the lungs or the throats

1124
01:23:50.611 --> 01:23:53.304
for the type of injuries
that we see with gas.

1125
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:57.860
- But even if a chemical had
affected them psychologically.

1126
01:23:57.894 --> 01:24:00.000
that doesn't explain
how they later received

1127
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:04.108
those violent injuries so
far away from the tent.

1128
01:24:04.142 --> 01:24:06.524
In those conditions. it
could have taken the group

1129
01:24:06.558 --> 01:24:09.768
more than an hour to walk
that distance without skis.

1130
01:24:10.769 --> 01:24:13.772
Why would they walk
relatively calmly for an hour

1131
01:24:13.807 --> 01:24:15.188
and then lose their minds

1132
01:24:15.222 --> 01:24:18.294
and inflict those injuries of
themselves?

1133
01:24:18.329 --> 01:24:19.916
It just doesn't add up.

1134
01:24:21.228 --> 01:24:22.747
I do believe it plausible

1135
01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:25.750
that the Soviets were testing
rockets over the Urals

1136
01:24:25.784 --> 01:24:28.960
at the time. but I just
don't see any evidence

1137
01:24:28.994 --> 01:24:32.550
that it could have directly
affected the group.

1138
01:24:32.584 --> 01:24:36.588
For me. I think the lights
in the sky are red herring.

1139
01:24:36.623 --> 01:24:38.832
They've derailed the case
for more than 60 years

1140
01:24:38.866 --> 01:24:40.696
and they continue to today.

1141
01:24:46.219 --> 01:24:49.049
But there's still another
difficult piece of the puzzle

1142
01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.189
that has fueled the
military conspiracy theories

1143
01:24:51.224 --> 01:24:55.918
for more than 60 years.
radiation.

1144
01:24:55.952 --> 01:24:58.507
Two of the four hikers
found in the ravine.

1145
01:24:58.541 --> 01:24:59.956
Lyuda and Kolevatov.

1146
01:24:59.991 --> 01:25:03.477
both wore clothes that tested
positive for radiation.

1147
01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:07.136
For many. this is proof
that some military weapon

1148
01:25:07.171 --> 01:25:08.275
killed the hikers.

1149
01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:12.797
But if that was the case. how
come radiation wasn't found

1150
01:25:12.831 --> 01:25:14.937
on any other member of the team?

1151
01:25:14.971 --> 01:25:17.871
Again. we need to look
for the simplest answer.

1152
01:25:18.768 --> 01:25:20.494
The sweater Lyuda was wearing

1153
01:25:20.529 --> 01:25:22.772
showed the highest levels of
radiation.

1154
01:25:22.807 --> 01:25:26.362
But in fact. this sweater
belonged to Krivonischenko.

1155
01:25:26.397 --> 01:25:29.124
who was found near the cedar
tree.

1156
01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:31.954
It looks like Lyuda may
have taken his sweater

1157
01:25:31.988 --> 01:25:33.197
after his death.

1158
01:25:34.232 --> 01:25:35.889
I've recently found a document

1159
01:25:35.923 --> 01:25:38.443
that shows that
Krivonischenko actually worked

1160
01:25:38.478 --> 01:25:40.480
at a nuclear facility.

1161
01:25:40.514 --> 01:25:42.689
Which only a year and a half
earlier.

1162
01:25:42.723 --> 01:25:45.381
suffered a major nuclear
explosion.

1163
01:25:46.348 --> 01:25:48.764
The Kyshtym disaster was at the
time.

1164
01:25:48.798 --> 01:25:51.215
the world's largest nuclear
disaster.

1165
01:25:51.249 --> 01:25:54.183
And even today. it's the third
largest

1166
01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:56.772
after Fukushima and Chernobyl.

1167
01:25:56.806 --> 01:25:59.844
Incredibly. most of us have
never even heard of it.

1168
01:25:59.878 --> 01:26:02.743
And that's because it was
almost entirely concealed

1169
01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:05.539
by the Soviets at the time.

1170
01:26:05.574 --> 01:26:09.578
In 1957. just a few days
after the explosion.

1171
01:26:09.612 --> 01:26:13.409
hundreds of local villages had
died of radiation poisoning

1172
01:26:13.444 --> 01:26:17.310
and more than 10.000 were
subsequently evacuated.

1173
01:26:18.242 --> 01:26:20.692
Given that this was one
of the world's first

1174
01:26:20.727 --> 01:26:22.729
major nuclear explosions.

1175
01:26:22.763 --> 01:26:25.939
it wouldn't be a surprise
to me that the cleanup team

1176
01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:31.013
including Krivonischenko were
unprepared and unprotected.

1177
01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:34.223
It's likely that he even
suspected his authorities

1178
01:26:34.258 --> 01:26:36.570
of being careless towards their
safety.

1179
01:26:37.571 --> 01:26:40.436
I've recently been sent a copy
of a letter

1180
01:26:40.471 --> 01:26:42.645
written by Krivonischenko
himself

1181
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.959
that seems to express his
frustration.

1182
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.489
- The second positive test for
radiation

1183
01:26:58.523 --> 01:27:00.491
was on Kolevatov's clothes.

1184
01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:03.735
Incredibly. I found that after
graduation.

1185
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:04.840
he too went to work

1186
01:27:04.874 --> 01:27:08.257
for a secretive nuclear
facility in Moscow.

1187
01:27:08.292 --> 01:27:11.156
It's quite possible that
he either came into contact

1188
01:27:11.191 --> 01:27:13.538
with materials from the Kyshtym
site

1189
01:27:13.573 --> 01:27:16.438
or he may have simply worn
the contaminated sweater

1190
01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:18.060
before giving it to Lyuda.

1191
01:27:19.303 --> 01:27:21.719
For me. the likelihood that the
radiation

1192
01:27:21.753 --> 01:27:23.376
found on the hikers' clothes

1193
01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.792
came from an actual nuclear
meltdown

1194
01:27:25.826 --> 01:27:29.692
where we know Krivonischenko
worked is far more likely

1195
01:27:29.727 --> 01:27:31.763
than some experimental weapons
attack.

1196
01:27:35.319 --> 01:27:38.943
So if rockets and radiation
were explainable red herrings.

1197
01:27:38.977 --> 01:27:42.705
Why was the military still
so eager to be involved?

1198
01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.745
- All of the secrecy was around
this case.

1199
01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:51.335
Not because there was
some military experiment

1200
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.200
or rocket crash.

1201
01:27:55.235 --> 01:28:00.240
but because Lev Ivanov
reported to his supervisors

1202
01:28:01.552 --> 01:28:06.660
that there were some strange
phenomena in the sky observed.

1203
01:28:06.695 --> 01:28:09.870
They just didn't want any
information out

1204
01:28:09.905 --> 01:28:13.080
before the investigation is
done.

1205
01:28:14.047 --> 01:28:17.188
- [Liam] This was during the
tensions of the Cold War.

1206
01:28:17.222 --> 01:28:19.190
The race for nuclear supremacy

1207
01:28:19.224 --> 01:28:20.709
was of the highest importance.

1208
01:28:21.848 --> 01:28:24.782
We now know that
Krivonischenko and Kolevatov

1209
01:28:24.816 --> 01:28:25.955
had reasonable ways

1210
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:29.856
in which they could have come
into contact with radiation.

1211
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:32.617
But importantly. from
the Soviet's position.

1212
01:28:32.652 --> 01:28:35.482
that's two hikers who may have
had access

1213
01:28:35.517 --> 01:28:38.243
to secret information or
materials.

1214
01:29:03.683 --> 01:29:06.617
Finding the last four bodies
must have been a relief

1215
01:29:06.651 --> 01:29:08.170
for the authorities.

1216
01:29:08.204 --> 01:29:12.070
They now knew that the hikers
had not defected as spies.

1217
01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:16.316
But when Ivanov requested
a radiation examination.

1218
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.423
the Soviets were faced
with a new challenge.

1219
01:29:19.457 --> 01:29:22.564
Information about the
nuclear disaster at Kyshtym

1220
01:29:22.598 --> 01:29:24.807
might leak to the public.

1221
01:29:24.842 --> 01:29:26.499
This would have been a massive
blow

1222
01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:28.742
to Russia's nuclear credibility.

1223
01:29:29.605 --> 01:29:32.194
Lev even wrote about his
experiences

1224
01:29:32.228 --> 01:29:35.370
years after the collapse
of the Soviet union

1225
01:29:50.937 --> 01:29:53.180
- The Soviet government had
their answer.

1226
01:29:53.215 --> 01:29:55.251
the hikers had not defected.

1227
01:29:55.286 --> 01:29:56.874
The true cause of the tragedy

1228
01:29:56.908 --> 01:29:58.979
was of little consequences to
them now.

1229
01:29:59.014 --> 01:30:01.361
And the truth about the Dyatlov
Pass

1230
01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.190
was buried along with the
hikers.

1231
01:30:07.712 --> 01:30:11.198
[intense dramatic music]

1232
01:30:14.167 --> 01:30:16.756
So if the Soviet
government wasn't involved

1233
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:19.137
in the hikers' death. who was?

1234
01:30:20.345 --> 01:30:22.762
The Dyatlov Pass is 50 miles
away

1235
01:30:22.796 --> 01:30:25.109
from the nearest village of
Vizhay.

1236
01:30:25.143 --> 01:30:27.732
The only people known to go near
the Pass

1237
01:30:27.767 --> 01:30:30.321
were the indigenous Mansi
people.

1238
01:30:30.355 --> 01:30:34.567
And so. the Mansi were the
original prime suspects.

1239
01:30:47.683 --> 01:30:49.409
- [Liam] Despite the suspicion.

1240
01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:53.378
the Mansi were quickly ruled
out for two key reasons.

1241
01:30:53.413 --> 01:30:56.865
One. the investigators believe
the hikers cut their own way

1242
01:30:56.899 --> 01:30:58.487
out of the tent.

1243
01:30:58.522 --> 01:31:00.282
Although I've already uncovered

1244
01:31:00.316 --> 01:31:02.491
that this was not definitively
proven

1245
01:31:02.526 --> 01:31:04.942
and probably incorrect.

1246
01:31:04.976 --> 01:31:07.531
Secondly. the local Russians
testified

1247
01:31:07.565 --> 01:31:09.222
that the Mansi were friendly

1248
01:31:09.256 --> 01:31:12.950
and some even offered to
help in the search efforts.

1249
01:31:12.984 --> 01:31:15.055
But does a friend's
recommendation

1250
01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:19.163
or being helpful to officials
rule you out of suspicion?

1251
01:31:19.197 --> 01:31:22.062
- No. we certainly have
seen in unsolved homicides

1252
01:31:22.097 --> 01:31:24.030
and all sorts of cases.

1253
01:31:24.064 --> 01:31:25.963
The perpetrator will come back

1254
01:31:25.997 --> 01:31:30.036
and insert themselves
into the investigation.

1255
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:33.902
That's something that's common.

1256
01:31:33.936 --> 01:31:37.388
The Bahtiyarov family lived
in a nomadic camp of yurts

1257
01:31:37.422 --> 01:31:40.253
in the upper reaches of the
Vizhay river.

1258
01:31:40.287 --> 01:31:43.774
One of the brothers. Peter
Bahtiyarov said in interview.

1259
01:31:51.782 --> 01:31:55.095
- Yet just 10 days earlier.
his brother Nikita.

1260
01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:57.753
who lived in the same family
camp stated.

1261
01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:11.560
- [Liam] The testimonies
were clearly conflicting.

1262
01:32:11.595 --> 01:32:14.632
And we now know there
were more sacred places.

1263
01:32:15.737 --> 01:32:17.497
Closer to Dyatlov's route.

1264
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.568
the hikers unknowingly took a
photo

1265
01:32:19.603 --> 01:32:22.640
of what we now know was a sacred
cave.

1266
01:32:24.504 --> 01:32:28.853
To the north. Man Pupu Ner was
the most sacred place of all.

1267
01:32:28.888 --> 01:32:32.477
Its mighty towers tell the
story of a great Mansi shaman

1268
01:32:32.512 --> 01:32:34.721
who turned giant warriors into
stone

1269
01:32:34.756 --> 01:32:37.103
when they threatened to destroy
the Mansi.

1270
01:32:38.069 --> 01:32:39.726
And at Mount Otorten.

1271
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:42.695
the very destination of the
Dyatlov team.

1272
01:32:42.729 --> 01:32:44.938
similar stone pillars are found.

1273
01:32:47.354 --> 01:32:48.839
During an interview. another
member

1274
01:32:48.873 --> 01:32:51.600
of the Bahtiyarov family. Pavel.

1275
01:32:51.635 --> 01:32:54.189
stated that he never
went near the mountains

1276
01:32:54.223 --> 01:32:56.709
where the Dyatlov team were
found.

1277
01:33:06.891 --> 01:33:10.343
- [Liam] But despite insisting
Mansi didn't go to this area.

1278
01:33:10.377 --> 01:33:13.415
there were signs that suggest
someone did.

1279
01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:20.560
- There were people who
were present in this area.

1280
01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:24.150
We know that there was a
discovery of chum

1281
01:33:25.427 --> 01:33:28.948
like meters above the tent.

1282
01:33:28.982 --> 01:33:30.984
And the search parties saw this
chum

1283
01:33:31.019 --> 01:33:33.331
and we have a picture of it.

1284
01:33:33.366 --> 01:33:34.919
- So the Mansi interviewed at
the time

1285
01:33:34.954 --> 01:33:36.438
said they didn't go near the
mountains

1286
01:33:36.472 --> 01:33:38.440
and they suddenly didn't hunt in
the area.

1287
01:33:38.474 --> 01:33:41.132
But here we have proof that
someone was.

1288
01:33:45.102 --> 01:33:48.105
Just because there were some
indigenous people in the area.

1289
01:33:48.139 --> 01:33:52.868
that doesn't mean there was
any real motive for an attack.

1290
01:33:52.903 --> 01:33:55.630
But when I dug deeper. there
were signs that the Russian

1291
01:33:55.664 --> 01:33:57.873
and indigenous people's
cohabitation

1292
01:33:57.908 --> 01:33:59.564
wasn't always harmonious.

1293
01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:05.122
In the 1930s. the Soviets
formed a new town called Kazym

1294
01:34:05.156 --> 01:34:08.021
in the Siberian Mansi-Khanty
region.

1295
01:34:08.056 --> 01:34:11.231
The idea was to bring schools
and medical facilities

1296
01:34:11.266 --> 01:34:15.166
to the local people as part of
the Soviet collectivization.

1297
01:34:16.064 --> 01:34:18.756
However. these changes
were imposed on the locals

1298
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:21.690
who were not given a say in the
matter.

1299
01:34:21.725 --> 01:34:24.244
They were forced to
comply with Soviet rules

1300
01:34:24.279 --> 01:34:26.005
and their children were forcibly
taken

1301
01:34:26.039 --> 01:34:27.489
to attend boarding schools.

1302
01:34:27.523 --> 01:34:29.111
where they were forbidden to
practice

1303
01:34:29.146 --> 01:34:31.044
their native language and
beliefs.

1304
01:34:32.114 --> 01:34:35.739
Understandably. the local people
were outraged and rebelled

1305
01:34:35.773 --> 01:34:37.430
against the authorities.

1306
01:34:37.464 --> 01:34:41.296
resulting in a number of
deadly conflicts in the 1930s.

1307
01:34:43.643 --> 01:34:45.058
Following these clashes.

1308
01:34:45.093 --> 01:34:48.130
Mansi and Khanty culture was
outlawed.

1309
01:34:48.165 --> 01:34:50.063
Sacred grounds were destroyed

1310
01:34:50.098 --> 01:34:54.102
And Sharmans practicing ancient
rituals were imprisoned.

1311
01:34:54.136 --> 01:34:57.243
The outlawing of thousands
of years of cultural belief

1312
01:34:57.277 --> 01:34:59.832
and history would have
undoubtedly fueled

1313
01:34:59.866 --> 01:35:02.248
a bitter resentment towards the
Soviet.

1314
01:35:03.767 --> 01:35:07.218
These rituals and practices
were still officially illegal

1315
01:35:07.253 --> 01:35:11.360
when the Dyatlov group attempted
to reach Mount Otorten.

1316
01:35:11.395 --> 01:35:14.536
Yet. signs of that tradition
still persist today.

1317
01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:53.290
We now know there were sacred
places in the mountains

1318
01:36:53.324 --> 01:36:55.568
and I'm not the first to wonder

1319
01:36:55.602 --> 01:36:57.742
if the Dyatlov group stumbled

1320
01:36:57.777 --> 01:37:00.676
onto a place of great
importance to the Mansi.

1321
01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:44.168
Do you think it's possible

1322
01:37:44.203 --> 01:37:45.998
the Mansi might've killed the
hikers

1323
01:37:46.032 --> 01:37:47.931
because they came across a
sacred site

1324
01:37:47.965 --> 01:37:50.588
or perhaps. a sacred artifact?

1325
01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:40.224
Speaking with Alexey.

1326
01:38:40.259 --> 01:38:43.365
I'm reminded how
dangerous and unfair it is

1327
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.680
to make generalizations
towards whole groups of people.

1328
01:38:47.714 --> 01:38:51.373
Since the Dyatlov incident.
there have been no other reports

1329
01:38:51.408 --> 01:38:55.308
of Mansi attacking
Russians over sacred land.

1330
01:38:55.343 --> 01:38:57.552
And certainly. my journey to the
Pass

1331
01:38:57.586 --> 01:38:59.934
was met with a warm welcome.

1332
01:38:59.968 --> 01:39:03.627
But the evidence so
far still suggest to me

1333
01:39:03.661 --> 01:39:05.284
that it was murder.

1334
01:39:05.318 --> 01:39:06.319
So I keep looking.

1335
01:39:07.976 --> 01:39:12.947
- Whoever attacked the students.
they were flesh and blood

1336
01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:18.124
because students were
capable of fighting back.

1337
01:39:18.159 --> 01:39:20.506
Generally. the people
who lived in the area

1338
01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.577
they're called the Mansi.

1339
01:39:22.611 --> 01:39:27.340
There are yet another
people called the Khanty.

1340
01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:31.137
They are not living there
constantly.

1341
01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:34.175
but there were rumors that some
of them.

1342
01:39:34.209 --> 01:39:38.765
just several of them were
living secluded in the area.

1343
01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.115
And they were not friends
with Mansi or with Russians.

1344
01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:46.497
- [Liam] Digging through
the official reports.

1345
01:39:46.532 --> 01:39:49.638
I spotted a detail that might
just provide

1346
01:39:49.673 --> 01:39:52.055
the biggest clue yet.

1347
01:39:52.089 --> 01:39:55.679
The official report from
police officer. Gorbushin.

1348
01:39:55.713 --> 01:39:57.439
in the town of Ivdel.

1349
01:39:57.474 --> 01:40:00.822
He speaks of an informal
conversation he had

1350
01:40:00.856 --> 01:40:03.652
with a member of the Mansi
Kurikov family.

1351
01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:22.740
- [Liam] Later. a member
of the Kurikov family.

1352
01:40:22.775 --> 01:40:25.709
Grigoriy. was officially
interviewed.

1353
01:40:39.067 --> 01:40:41.587
- [Liam] Despite the
police offices tantalizing

1354
01:40:41.621 --> 01:40:43.209
piece of information.

1355
01:40:43.244 --> 01:40:45.660
the suspicion that other
indigenous people

1356
01:40:45.694 --> 01:40:50.044
were living in the area was
not further investigated.

1357
01:40:50.078 --> 01:40:52.563
And there's one last clue.

1358
01:40:52.598 --> 01:40:56.360
A strip of dark material
found at the cedar tree

1359
01:40:56.395 --> 01:40:59.294
where the first two
bodies were discovered.

1360
01:40:59.329 --> 01:41:02.987
Search party member. Boris
Slobstov wrote.

1361
01:41:18.279 --> 01:41:21.454
- [Liam] Despite the clues
and evidence of violence.

1362
01:41:21.489 --> 01:41:23.629
the authorities dropped the
search

1363
01:41:23.663 --> 01:41:25.872
for any possible attackers.

1364
01:41:25.907 --> 01:41:29.566
The truth of this unknown
compelling force

1365
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.465
has remained hidden under
wintery snows

1366
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.780
and tightly held secrets
for more than 60 years.

1367
01:41:36.814 --> 01:41:40.542
- The crushing injuries
and the skull fractures

1368
01:41:40.577 --> 01:41:43.752
because they're so different.

1369
01:41:43.787 --> 01:41:46.376
there had to be three or four
assailants

1370
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:49.033
involved in whatever this
incident was.

1371
01:41:49.068 --> 01:41:50.863
And I don't believe that in any
way.

1372
01:41:50.897 --> 01:41:52.934
could just be an accident.

1373
01:42:06.741 --> 01:42:11.401
- When you look at the wounds
that were on the hikers.

1374
01:42:11.435 --> 01:42:13.644
I'm just not buying the
accidental thing.

1375
01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:14.576
this was a homicide.

1376
01:42:30.558 --> 01:42:34.320
- I have a strong conviction
that military people

1377
01:42:34.355 --> 01:42:36.357
wouldn't do it this way.

1378
01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:38.704
There is an expression in
Russian.

1379
01:42:38.738 --> 01:42:40.913
If there is no body. there is no
case.

1380
01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.987
[dramatic music]

1381
01:42:58.275 --> 01:42:59.759
- [Liam] From the beginning.

1382
01:42:59.794 --> 01:43:02.935
this mystery captured my
imagination.

1383
01:43:02.969 --> 01:43:05.903
And after two years of studying
the case.

1384
01:43:05.938 --> 01:43:08.112
it's become something more.

1385
01:43:08.147 --> 01:43:12.324
Every diary entry. every
glance and every photo

1386
01:43:12.358 --> 01:43:17.087
seems to hide a clue like a
distant voice compelling me

1387
01:43:17.121 --> 01:43:18.606
to join the search.

1388
01:43:21.056 --> 01:43:24.232
So this is roughly where
the Dyatlov tent was found.

1389
01:43:25.302 --> 01:43:27.753
It's incredible to be here
and I can see why they wanted

1390
01:43:27.787 --> 01:43:29.133
to be out here. it's beautiful.

1391
01:43:29.168 --> 01:43:30.652
And it's so isolated.

1392
01:43:30.687 --> 01:43:33.517
Like 100 kilometers away
from any other village.

1393
01:43:34.346 --> 01:43:37.107
It must've been absolutely
exhilarating for them

1394
01:43:37.141 --> 01:43:40.421
to have been hiking in
these types of locations.

1395
01:43:40.455 --> 01:43:43.941
And it's still a mystery
as to what happened

1396
01:43:43.976 --> 01:43:46.427
but I certainly understand
better

1397
01:43:46.461 --> 01:43:49.292
why they came out here
in the first place now.

1398
01:43:49.326 --> 01:43:52.571
[dramatic music]

1399
01:43:52.605 --> 01:43:54.089
In some small way.

1400
01:43:54.124 --> 01:43:56.747
I feel I've come to know the
hikers.

1401
01:43:56.782 --> 01:43:58.922
I certainly wish I could
have had the chance

1402
01:43:58.956 --> 01:44:00.061
to have met them.

1403
01:44:01.027 --> 01:44:03.547
I think we could have
shared an adventure or two.

1404
01:44:04.928 --> 01:44:06.585
There may be more evidence

1405
01:44:06.619 --> 01:44:09.208
and theories surrounding
this case to come.

1406
01:44:10.071 --> 01:44:13.108
But out of respect of the
Dyatlov group.

1407
01:44:13.143 --> 01:44:17.112
I believe they should all be
explored with an open mind.

1408
01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:21.703
We may be looking at it
through different lenses

1409
01:44:21.738 --> 01:44:24.223
but our vision is the same.

1410
01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:29.263
to lay to rest the mystery of
an unknown compelling force.

1411
01:44:29.573 --> 01:44:33.094
[intense dramatic music]
