[Black Beauty narrating]
A wise horse once told me...

4
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.022
...that a mustang's spirit
can never be broken.

5
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.943
That it has the strength of the ocean...

6
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.490
and lives forever. like the wind.

7
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.286
Over the course of my life...

8
00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.374
my spirit has been tested
a thousand times...

9
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:27.545
until I discovered a secret that saved me.

10
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:34.344
And to tell you what it is.
we have to start at the very beginning.

11
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.056
The story of a wild horse...

12
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.976
and the girl she loved.

13
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.238
I was born in a golden meadow...

14
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.033
on a bed of soft wildflowers.

[horse whinnies]

20
00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.019
[Black Beauty] It was endless...

21
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.022
and beautiful.

22
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.189
[horse whinnies]

23
00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.488
[Black Beauty]
I was a little shy to meet my family.

24
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.992
There were so many of them.

25
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.327
[horse nickers]

26
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.375
[Black Beauty]
To prove myself to the herd...

27
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.048
I had to be strong and fast and fearless.

28
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.557
As I got older.
I felt a fire rising up in me.

29
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:08.313
My mother said it was my mustang spirit.
and it would always guide me.

30
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.568
She said I should never kick or bite
without a good reason.

31
00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.364
but always try to be gentle and kind.

32
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.453
[horse whinnies]

33
00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:28.041
My heart ached to explore
the world beyond our meadow.

34
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.629
A place nobody could ever take from us.

35
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:43.807
When I turned two years old.
I made a discovery.

[cows mooing]

37
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.480
Strange creatures
were moving onto our land.

38
00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.239
It was against the rules
to leave the mountains...

39
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.618
but I had to find out
where they were coming from.

40
00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.125
[man] We gotta find that mustang herd.

41
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.462
There she goes.
We're coming back for you. pretty thing!

42

[horse whinnies]

44
00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.640
[Black Beauty] I knew I had put
my whole family in danger.

45
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.771
That night my mother told me a story

46
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.357
about what happens
when a horse leaves this Earth.

47
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.986
That she wouldn't always be there
to protect me...

48
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.031
but that I shouldn't worry

49
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.533
because when it is a horse's time to go...

50
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.786
it gallops toward the sky.

51
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.414
just as if it can fly.

52
00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.751
And that when her time came...

53
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.962
she would always watch over me...

54
00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.799
from her bed in the stars.

[Black Beauty]
I knew I had made a terrible mistake.

60
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.568
I had led them right to us.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.199
[man 2] That filly's out of her mind.

67
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.537
[Black Beauty] It was my first experience
with the creatures they called...

68
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.414
humans.

69
00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.300
I lost my mother in the stampede.

70
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.512
It was the last time I ever saw her.

71
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.268
And I knew it was all my fault.

72
00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:41.443
I felt hurt and guilty and just so angry.

73
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.364
My mother said a mustang's spirit
could never be broken.

74
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.201
But I was beginning to doubt
if that was true.

75
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.163
My spirit felt shattered.

76
00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.256
Hey. How you doin'?

77
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.799
[man 1] Well. well. well.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.011
From all the way out east. huh?

79
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.972
Quite the haul.

80
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.100
I drove all the way out from New York.

[horses whinnying]

82
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.064
[man 2] You gotta get fresh water.

83
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.983
Yeah. I was just about to change it out
this morning.

84
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.651
One of my staffers got sick.

85
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.820
How many you looking to take?

86
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.864

She's a pretty one.

90
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.456
[man 1] Yeah. well.
that filly's got a horrible temper.

91
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.209
Trust me. you don't want her.

92
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.503
She's a strike horse anyway.

93
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.254
It's leaving this afternoon.

[man 2] Course you don't.

98

The new man seemed different.

99
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.065
His eyes were softer.

100
00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.817

-You're just frightened. I know.
-[whinnies]

102

103

A lot of personality. all right.

104
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.247
Well-built too. Elegant.

105
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.084

Round 'em up.

106

Hold on. I'll take her.

107
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:33.263
[Black Beauty]
As we drove away from that awful place.

108
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:37.350
I had no idea how lucky I was
to be one of the few chosen.

109
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.812
Because not many people
want a wild mustang to train.

There you go. Buck it out.

-She is. isn't she?
-It's just--

115
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.447
The other ones seem much more decidedly--

116
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.115
Tame?

117
00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.451

-Trust me.
-[man] I do.

125

But the rescues
have a time limit here. John.

We both know that.

127
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.445
[Black Beauty] My first night at Birtwick.

128
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.532
I miss my family.

129
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.077
The other horses were all strangers.

130
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.748
But it was quieter there.

131
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.584
And I could hear a new sound.

132
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.379
Smell salt on the air.

133
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:33.800
It was peaceful.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:38.388
And finally. I slept.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.777
[Black Beauty] I wondered what the new man
wanted from me.

138
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.167
He couldn't possibly understand.

139
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.753
All right. In your own time.

140
00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.216

The boy and I developed a game.

but humans had not been kind
or good to me.

148
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.902
So why should I be to them?

149
00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.113

got a real mean streak.

Still. I don't see how
you can break a horse like that.

For her sake. let's try. shall we?

There you go. [shushes]

I decided humans must be very lazy.

157

They always wanted
to be carried around by something.

he could outsmart me with his tricks.

Good girl.

I liked the fire in her immediately.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.648
She was followed by the funniest
little horse I had ever seen.

170
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.776
It looked like he couldn't stop dancing.

171
00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:02.407
I learned that they were called
Ginger and Merrylegs.

172
00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:07.078
We eventually became friends.
and they turned us out together.

made his home near my paddock.

something different about the girl.

But even with a horse to help him...

-Oh!

243
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.376

Then I give him his space.

I'm trying to talk to him.
to learn his language.

246

he's saying a whole lot to me right now.

The biggest rule is.
I can't get angry or frustrated at him.

If I get angry. he'll feel it.

00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:37.013
Why would I care
about what you're feeling?

358
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:41.184
You didn't bother to see my mom.
You didn't even bother to meet me.

359
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:44.020
-[John] No. no. No. I met you. I met you.
-Yeah?

360
00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:46.189
-I saw you. When you were--
-[Jo] Yeah?

361
00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:49.567
And I barely remembered your face
when I got here.

362
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.153
Jo. Jo. I'm sorry.

363
00:26:52.237 --> 00:26:53.655
Don't touch me.

364
00:26:58.368 --> 00:26:59.953
I wanna go home.

365
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.789
You can't go home. Jo. You can't go home.

366
00:27:02.872 --> 00:27:03.957
Your mom and dad--

367
00:27:09.212 --> 00:27:10.213
I'm sorry.

368
00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:13.717
Jo.

369
00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:18.054
-Jo?
-[Jo] I said. leave me alone!

370
00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:18.972
[John] You stop...

371
00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:20.557
[Black Beauty]
They were like two mustangs.

372
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.183
fighting in the wild.

373
00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:23.518
[Jo grunts]

374
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:24.686
[Black Beauty] And as I watched them.

375
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:30.275
I realized maybe humans and horses
weren't so different after all.

376
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.861
[crickets chirping]

377
00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:36.239
[Black Beauty]
I couldn't sleep at all that night.

378
00:27:37.949 --> 00:27:39.784
I was too worried about Jo.

379
00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:42.746
[door closes]

380
00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:47.709
-[breathes heavily]
-[horse whinnies]

381
00:27:54.883 --> 00:27:58.386
[Black Beauty]
The look on her face made my heart break.

382
00:28:02.932 --> 00:28:07.687
I recognized it because I still had
nightmares about losing my family.

383
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:21.034
In that moment...

384
00:28:22.118 --> 00:28:26.456
I wished I could tell Jo
where her parents were.

385
00:28:27.332 --> 00:28:29.209
like my mother had told me.

386
00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:33.963
Watching over her...

387
00:28:36.216 --> 00:28:38.385
from their bed in the stars.

388
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:46.851
I stayed with her
until the sun rose again the next day.

389
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.314
[John] Jo? [panting]

390
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.565
Where are you?

391
00:28:57.904 --> 00:28:58.822
Jo?

392
00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:00.490
[panting]

393
00:29:00.573 --> 00:29:01.991
Jo.

394
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:03.993
Oh. thank God.

395
00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:05.745
You scared the life out of me.

396
00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:08.873
What are you doing sleeping out here?

397
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.961
[panting continues]

398
00:29:13.044 --> 00:29:15.463
What am I supposed to do with you?

399
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.092
This is new terrain for me too. you know.

400
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:21.803
You're grounded.

401
00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:24.264
Really?

402
00:29:24.347 --> 00:29:25.849
[John] Yeah. really.

403
00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.268
In fact. I have a better idea.

404
00:29:29.352 --> 00:29:31.938
I'm gonna show you
how to wield a pitchfork.

405
00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:38.653
-[girl 1] Well. yeah. but it's not--
-[girl 2] But I'm not going to--

406
00:29:38.737 --> 00:29:40.447
[girl 1] You don't have to be intimidated.
you know.

407
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.781
[girl 2] I'm not-- [scoffs]

408
00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:44.576
She's cleaning up after our horses.

409
00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:46.619
That is so sad.

410
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.204
Super sad.

411
00:29:48.288 --> 00:29:49.289
[horse whinnies]

412
00:29:51.082 --> 00:29:54.669
I heard if they can't save them.
they turn them into glue.

413
00:29:57.088 --> 00:29:59.466
-What did you say?
-[girl 2] Nothing.

414
00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:00.675
Um...

415
00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:02.886
You've just got a little something there.

416
00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:06.514
Yeah.
You got a little something right there.

417
00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:08.850
Oh! [chuckles]

418
00:30:11.811 --> 00:30:13.313
-I'm sorry.
-[girl 2] What are you doing?

419
00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:15.106
-Come over here and help me.
-[girl 1] Just--

420
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.191
Oh. my God!

421
00:30:16.274 --> 00:30:17.859
-You're fine. It's just--
-No. I'm not fine.

422
00:30:17.942 --> 00:30:20.195
-You've just got a little bit of dirt--
-Obviously. I'm not fine!

423
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:22.572
[girl 2] It's disgusting. and it's
ridiculous. and it's unacceptable.

424
00:30:24.783 --> 00:30:26.284
This place sucks.

425
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:28.286
-[Black Beauty nickers]
-[chuckles]

426
00:30:29.162 --> 00:30:31.581
Sorry. Not here with you.

427
00:30:32.624 --> 00:30:33.708
[chuckles]

428
00:30:33.792 --> 00:30:35.877
This is the only safe place there is.

429
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:39.464
[sighs]

430
00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:42.634
School sucks. People suck.

431
00:30:44.803 --> 00:30:46.638
Maybe we should just run away together.

432
00:30:49.224 --> 00:30:50.433
What you think?

433
00:30:56.606 --> 00:30:58.274
[nickers]

434
00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:00.026
[whinnies]

435
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.529
No. no. no. I'm sorry. It's gone.

436
00:31:02.612 --> 00:31:03.655
[galloping departing]

437
00:31:03.738 --> 00:31:05.323
[John] She's conditioned to hate it.

438
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:07.701
She's a smart horse.

439
00:31:11.955 --> 00:31:15.792
Did you know that wild mustang bands
aren't led by a stallion?

440
00:31:17.127 --> 00:31:18.712
They're usually led by a mare.

441
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:22.424
Not always the biggest or strongest
or most popular.

442
00:31:22.507 --> 00:31:25.343
but the one who's gone through
the most life experience.

443
00:31:26.094 --> 00:31:27.929
She leads through respect.

444
00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.017
That's why mustangs are unique.

445
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.936
Why are you telling me this?

446
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:36.896
'Cause. to me.

447
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.400
I think you're more of a wise mustang
than a yappy little show dog.

448
00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:42.819
[horse whinnies in distance]

449
00:31:43.653 --> 00:31:45.071
Dinner's ready in ten.

450
00:31:46.322 --> 00:31:47.657
I'm making lasagna.

451
00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:55.498
[man] You can't even lead the horse. John.
She's a lost cause.

452
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.168
[John] I just need a bit more time.

453
00:31:58.251 --> 00:32:01.254
[man] Now. you know we just can't keep
the mustangs that won't be gentle.

454
00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:03.715
We have to make space.

455
00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:16.936
So. Mr. Gordon says
that if you don't get tamed.

456
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.314
-you're gonna have to go somewhere else.
-[nickers]

457
00:32:19.397 --> 00:32:21.566
And probably not as nice of a place.

458
00:32:28.323 --> 00:32:32.077
Now... I know you're not gonna hurt me...

459
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.165
and I'm not gonna hurt you... ever.

460
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.251
So do you think we could try?

461
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.463
-And show him how gentle you are?
-[nickers]

462
00:32:47.258 --> 00:32:49.469
[whinnies]

463
00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:50.929
I know. I know.

464
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:54.599
It can't be all that bad. right?

465
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.060
It's better than being homeless.

466
00:32:57.977 --> 00:32:59.145
Please.

467
00:33:00.522 --> 00:33:01.940
Just trust me.

468
00:33:03.191 --> 00:33:04.609
Here. look.

469
00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:08.697
Oh. wow.

470
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.656
[Jo] See?

471
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.117
See. it doesn't hurt me.

472
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.743
[nickers]

473
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.664
[chuckles]

474
00:33:17.747 --> 00:33:18.748
Okay.

475
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.334
Let's try this.

476
00:33:29.092 --> 00:33:30.176
See?

477
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.388
There.

478
00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:38.101
[softly] Almost there.

479
00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:43.064
Oh! [chuckles]

480
00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:44.190
It's all right.

481
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:51.656
Well. there's no way
she's actually going to lead her.

482
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.327
Would you walk with me? Come on.

483
00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:01.332
Beginner's luck.

484
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:04.919
Yeah. Or maybe she's just talented.

485
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:07.464
[Black Beauty whinnies]

486
00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:08.798
[chuckles]

487
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.843
[Mr. Gordon] Well. I'll be darned.

488
00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:16.598
Maybe you two have something
in common after all.

489
00:34:17.557 --> 00:34:18.975
[chuckles]

490
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.192
Don't want any part of this world. huh?

491
00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:29.235
This is different.

492
00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:39.788
[Black Beauty] The sparring between Jo and
her uncle happened much less after that.

493
00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:41.831
[nickers]

494
00:34:41.915 --> 00:34:42.832
[chuckles]

495
00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:45.669
[Jo] So you do like it. huh?

496
00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:47.629
Well. good.

497
00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:51.508
Uncle John says you're safe for now.
but you'll be broken in soon.

498
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:53.009
whatever that means.

499
00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:57.472
[Black Beauty] Jo was proud of me.
and I wanted to prove myself to her.

500
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.643
[John] So the first thing is the bridle.
Let's see how this goes.

501
00:35:01.726 --> 00:35:03.395
-[nickers]
-Come on. Beauty.

502
00:35:05.063 --> 00:35:06.481
Beauty. come on.

503
00:35:07.232 --> 00:35:08.233
I have an idea.

504
00:35:08.817 --> 00:35:11.820
Maybe the taste won't be so bad.

505
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:17.575
-There you--
-There you go.

506
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.703
How'd you know how to do that?

507
00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:21.788
Felt like the right thing to do. I guess.

508
00:35:22.706 --> 00:35:24.040
[metal clanking]

509
00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:30.463
[Black Beauty] I knew humans liked
to wear things on their feet. But horses?

510
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:31.798
Beauty.

511
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:33.174
[nickers]

512
00:35:33.258 --> 00:35:34.551
[horse whinnies]

513
00:35:34.634 --> 00:35:38.054
Ginger and Merrylegs laughed loud enough
for the whole stable to hear.

514
00:35:39.347 --> 00:35:40.849
It was so embarrassing.

515
00:35:41.725 --> 00:35:43.226
Saddle is next.

516
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.189
You take the pad first and get her
used to something weighing on her.

517
00:35:48.273 --> 00:35:50.233
-Ready?
-[John] Nice. Yeah. Nice and slowly.

518
00:35:50.316 --> 00:35:52.986
Easy now. Come on. Beauty.

519
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:55.030
[whinnies]

520
00:35:56.865 --> 00:35:57.907
[John] Come on.

521
00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:04.372
[Jo grunts]

522
00:36:04.456 --> 00:36:05.540
[whinnies]

523
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.501
[Jo] There we go.

524
00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.920
Now we're making some progress.

525
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.592
Do we really have to put that on her?

526
00:36:16.426 --> 00:36:17.719
To break her. yeah.

527
00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:19.471
Why do you call it that?

528
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.431
What?

529
00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:22.891
"Breaking."

530
00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:25.602
It's just a term. Breaking a horse.

531
00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:26.936
Should really change it.

532
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.773
What would you change it to?

533
00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:33.568
"Partnering."

534
00:36:35.445 --> 00:36:36.821
Partner a horse.

535
00:36:40.283 --> 00:36:41.451
All right. Ready?

536
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.455
Attagirl.

537
00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:48.083
You did it.

538
00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:49.209
[Black Beauty nickers]

539
00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:51.378
[girl] Hi. Jo.

540

-[Black Beauty nickers]
-[John shushes]

541
00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:54.839
You're all right.

542
00:36:54.923 --> 00:36:56.508
Doesn't it feel too soon?

543
00:36:57.217 --> 00:36:59.803
I mean. she's come so far already.

544
00:37:00.637 --> 00:37:02.055
Not far enough.

545
00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:04.307
We can't sell her if she can't be ridden.

546
00:37:04.974 --> 00:37:06.434
Sell her?

547
00:37:06.518 --> 00:37:08.395
What do you think we're breaking her for?

548
00:37:08.895 --> 00:37:12.232
Sorry. "partnering." I do like that.

549
00:37:12.315 --> 00:37:13.983
But why would you sell her?

550
00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:17.237
Oh. Jo. I don't own this place.

551
00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:21.491
The conservancy part is to train
and adopt out a few mustangs a year.

552
00:37:21.574 --> 00:37:23.076
not to keep them.

553
00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:26.996
Do you know how many are out there
that need help? Thousands.

554
00:37:28.748 --> 00:37:31.584
Let's give it a go. Nice and easy.

555
00:37:35.672 --> 00:37:38.299
-It's okay. girl. It's okay.
-All right. Beauty. Attagirl.

562
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:55.442
Are you okay?

563
00:37:57.235 --> 00:37:58.319
I'll survive.

[birds chirping]

567
00:38:06.453 --> 00:38:10.957
[Black Beauty] My friendship with Jo
blossomed. like flowers do in spring.

568
00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:15.503
Some of these really are beautiful.

569
00:38:17.422 --> 00:38:20.175
[Black Beauty]
We had an unspoken language... together.

570
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.472
[horse whinnies in distance]

571
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:45.742
Do you ever think
about your family. Beauty?

572
00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:47.410
[nickers]

573
00:38:48.411 --> 00:38:50.413
I try not to think of mine.

574
00:38:52.582 --> 00:38:54.167
It hurts too much.

575
00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:56.294
You know?

576
00:38:58.755 --> 00:39:00.423
[cries]

577
00:39:01.257 --> 00:39:02.842
[Black Beauty]
I hated seeing her so upset.

578
00:39:04.302 --> 00:39:07.764
When I was sad. I ran as fast as I could.

579
00:39:08.973 --> 00:39:12.644
But since Jo couldn't gallop.
I had an idea.

580
00:39:12.727 --> 00:39:13.853
[nickers]

581
00:39:16.564 --> 00:39:17.565
What are you doing?

582
00:39:20.568 --> 00:39:21.569
Do you want me to--

583
00:39:26.032 --> 00:39:29.619
I can't. I don't know how.

584
00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:31.496
[Black Beauty]
I really wished she would try.

585
00:39:32.122 --> 00:39:34.249
I knew Jo could be fearless.

586
00:39:34.332 --> 00:39:35.709
[Jo] Okay.

587
00:39:44.592 --> 00:39:45.427

Whoa! Oh.

591
00:40:01.026 --> 00:40:03.194
-[Black Beauty] I had trusted her.
-[Jo] Oh!

592
00:40:04.529 --> 00:40:07.157
[Black Beauty] Now she needed to trust me.

593
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.074
[boy] John!

594
00:40:09.034 --> 00:40:10.035
Mr. Gordon!

595

-[Jo] Beauty!
-[John] What the--

596
00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:26.676
[Black Beauty]I knew that if Jo
could feel the wind in her mane.

597
00:40:27.427 --> 00:40:28.845
it would help her to heal.

598
00:40:47.364 --> 00:40:48.365
-[Mr. Gordon] Jo. hold on!
-[John] Jo!

599
00:40:48.448 --> 00:40:51.284

00:40:56.122 --> 00:40:57.957

603
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:02.796

00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:04.798
Oh! [chuckles]

605
00:41:10.637 --> 00:41:12.347

Jo and I learned to ride together.

606
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:15.225
-[Jo] Is that good?
-[John] It's good.

607
00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:17.686
That's it. Keep control.

608
00:41:17.769 --> 00:41:20.814

She fell a lot in the beginning.

609
00:41:20.897 --> 00:41:22.899
-[John] Hey. are you okay?
-Yeah.

610
00:41:23.733 --> 00:41:25.860
[Black Beauty] No wonder they rode horses.

611
00:41:25.944 --> 00:41:28.029
Humans were very clumsy.

612
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:29.948
Maybe we should try Merrylegs instead.

613
00:41:30.782 --> 00:41:31.908
[Jo chuckles]

614
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:33.868
-Back on?
-Back on.

615
00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:40.291

But we got the hang of it. together.

617
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.592

[Black Beauty] Jo and I galloped
like nothing in the world could catch us.

621
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:12.407
We were two beings.

622
00:42:12.949 --> 00:42:16.202
and yet. for just a moment...

623
00:42:17.704 --> 00:42:18.872
we were one.

624
00:42:35.847 --> 00:42:39.434
We had found our peace... together.

00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:53.073
[Black Beauty] As the summer ended.
there was new life all around.

00:42:54.783 --> 00:42:57.410
They reminded me of my mother and I.

628
00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:04.584
When the big yellow trailer
came for Jo again...

629
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:07.504
I could smell change on the air.

630
00:43:08.588 --> 00:43:10.340
[nickers]

631
00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:12.926
[Black Beauty] Riding wasn't
as much fun without Jo.

632
00:43:13.468 --> 00:43:15.595
but I had to learn
to have others on my back.

633
00:43:17.013 --> 00:43:21.017
I started to like John.
even though he was kind of heavy.

A new groom started taking care of us.

636
00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:34.239
He was always very distracted.

637
00:43:35.281 --> 00:43:38.118
If the sky fell down.
I wondered if he would even notice.

638
00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:40.912
-Hey. you can wait. Come on.

I'm trying to keep the mustang program
alive. but business hasn't been--

641
00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:48.545
[John] I understand. Hey.

642
00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:51.423
You gotta get your nose out of that phone
while you're working.

Make sure to watch the new filly tonight.
She might get chilled.

646
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:01.141
Sure thing.

647
00:44:17.824 --> 00:44:20.744
[Black Beauty] I watched over them
for hours. just in case.

648
00:44:20.827 --> 00:44:22.579
You're all warmed up now. aren't ya?

649
00:44:23.663 --> 00:44:27.334
[Black Beauty] I was surprised when the
groom put down his little box for a while.

650
00:44:27.417 --> 00:44:31.004
and the frozen look he always had
on his face faded away.

That night. I had a terrible dream.

As the stable went up in flames...

691
00:47:01.196 --> 00:47:05.617
so did my newfound hope of a life with Jo.

[police radio chatter]

693
00:47:17.504 --> 00:47:20.674
[Black Beauty] It was because of Jo's
courage that the horses were all saved.

694
00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:26.846
Her calm. steady voice
broke through my fear.

695
00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:29.974
which was the only reason
I could even follow her.

696
00:47:33.603 --> 00:47:35.855
The young groom
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

697
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.275
but his carelessness put our lives
in danger...

698
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.946
and had destroyed our beautiful home.

699
00:47:45.448 --> 00:47:48.952
It was the beginning of the end
at Birtwick.

-[Jo] Mr. Gordon.
-Jo. what can I do for you?

00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.917
Please. you can't sell Beauty.

702
00:47:56.418 --> 00:47:59.879
I'm sorry. Jo.
All the trained horses have to be sold.

703
00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:02.424
We just don't have the space
with all that damage.

704
00:48:02.507 --> 00:48:04.509
-But--
-You saved her life. Jo.

705
00:48:04.592 --> 00:48:06.136
in more ways than one.

706
00:48:06.928 --> 00:48:08.680
Don't you want to do that for more horses?

707
00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:12.058
Mr. Gordon. what if I could buy her?

708
00:48:12.142 --> 00:48:13.226
Sorry?

709
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:15.729
[Jo] I could work for you.
Help train the others.

710
00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:17.689
rebuild the barn. anything you need.

711
00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:20.025
Every morning. every day after school.

712
00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:22.986
[Mr. Gordon] Look. I just don't know
if that's the right thing to do.

713
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:24.446
Uncle John. please.

714
00:48:24.529 --> 00:48:26.156
He can't take Beauty away.

715
00:48:28.908 --> 00:48:33.496
Well. it is only after working with Beauty
that your grades have improved.

716
00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:36.833
You haven't gotten into another fight
at school.

717
00:48:36.916 --> 00:48:38.168
[Jo] Exactly.

718
00:48:38.251 --> 00:48:41.838
The trouble. Jo.
is boarding Beauty is very expensive.

719
00:48:42.964 --> 00:48:43.965
All right.

720
00:48:46.843 --> 00:48:47.844
I tell you what.

721
00:48:48.678 --> 00:48:51.890
If you can pay for her food
and what she's cost us so far

722
00:48:52.557 --> 00:48:54.976
by the end of summer. she's yours.

723
00:48:58.146 --> 00:49:03.818
And you can board her here for free
in exchange for being Birtwick's mascot.

724
00:49:03.902 --> 00:49:04.944
Are you serious?

725
00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.405
[chuckling] Look.
don't make me overthink this.

726
00:49:08.948 --> 00:49:09.949
All right.

727
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:12.202
Thank you. Mr. Gordon.

728
00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:15.080
Thank you. Uncle John.

729
00:49:15.163 --> 00:49:17.415
[Mr. Gordon] But there's one thing
you need to understand.

730
00:49:17.499 --> 00:49:20.251
There's a chance I might lease Beauty out
for the summer.

731
00:49:20.335 --> 00:49:23.755
just to free up space while we build
the new stable. if anybody wants her.

732
00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:27.801
-Deal?
-Deal.

733
00:49:43.566 --> 00:49:46.820
-I'm so sorry about the stable. Mr. Manly.
-Thank you.

734
00:49:46.903 --> 00:49:49.781
-It's absolutely disgusting here. Mother.
-Darling. quiet.

735
00:49:50.532 --> 00:49:51.741
[whispering] George Winthorp.

736
00:49:52.784 --> 00:49:53.952
I mean. seriously.

737
00:49:54.035 --> 00:49:58.373
This filly is spirited. but a fine jumper
with a right gentle touch.

738
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:03.378
-He's just. like. totally ideal.
-Do you think he knows who we are?

739
00:50:04.004 --> 00:50:05.964
I mean. yeah.
I feel like he's looked at me before.

740
00:50:06.047 --> 00:50:09.342
Oh. my gosh. Mum. look at that horse.

741
00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:13.596
-Well. isn't that a mustang?
-[daughter] So?

742
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.683
-Darling. you want a thoroughbred.
-Everyone has a thoroughbred.

743
00:50:17.392 --> 00:50:19.561
She's a Pryor mustang. isn't she?

744
00:50:20.353 --> 00:50:21.938
-You know your horses.
-[Mrs. Winthorp] Mm.

745
00:50:22.022 --> 00:50:24.107
She's so beautiful.

746
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.444
And that's the funny thing.
but that's her name. Beauty.

747
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:30.780
-But like your mother said. you probably--
-Is she for sale?

748
00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:33.324
-Uh. no. She's not for sale.
-Oh.

749
00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:37.328
She's. uh... She's for lease.

750
00:50:37.412 --> 00:50:38.788
Wow! [giggles]

751
00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:40.623
[Mrs. Winthorp] Is it even rideable?

752
00:50:40.707 --> 00:50:43.918
She is.
My niece was the one to gentle her.

753
00:50:46.588 --> 00:50:48.798
But look. we-- we've got plenty of horses.

754
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.468
-Oh. good.
-Go and speak to him.

755
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:54.763
[girl] Do it for both of us.
Don't mess it up. Okay. go.

756
00:50:54.846 --> 00:50:57.349
[John] But...
we got all sorts of horses. so...

757
00:50:57.432 --> 00:50:59.976
-[Mrs. Winthorp] Yes. all sorts. darling.
-No. Mummy. I want that one.

758
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.227
-[girl 2] Let's go.
-What happened?

759
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:03.605
-I said let's go.
-Why didn't you just talk to him?

760
00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:06.316
[girl 2] Because it was a stupid idea
and a ridiculous situation.

761
00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:07.776
[girl 1] Why-- No. it wasn't.

762
00:51:07.859 --> 00:51:08.902
[George] Hello.

763
00:51:09.569 --> 00:51:11.404
-Hi.
-[Black Beauty nickers]

764
00:51:13.448 --> 00:51:16.034
I heard you were the one
to break this beautiful filly.

765
00:51:16.117 --> 00:51:17.535
Well. partnered.

766
00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:22.290
Oh. you mean. like.
partnering instead of breaking.

767
00:51:23.833 --> 00:51:24.834
I like that.

768
00:51:25.502 --> 00:51:28.088
[Black Beauty] She was nervous around him.

769
00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:30.090
I'm George. by the way.

770
00:51:31.466 --> 00:51:32.801
Jo.

771
00:51:32.884 --> 00:51:34.552
[Black Beauty]
I think Jo thought he was handsome.

772
00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:37.138
-Sorry.
-What for?

773
00:51:38.264 --> 00:51:40.225
[daughter] Yay! [chuckles]

774
00:51:40.308 --> 00:51:41.935
-[Mrs. Winthorp] Good.
-[Jo] What's going on over there?

775
00:51:42.977 --> 00:51:45.105
I think my sister just leased your horse.

776
00:51:45.939 --> 00:51:46.940
What?

777
00:51:47.023 --> 00:51:49.025
[horse whinnies in distance]

778
00:51:57.659 --> 00:51:59.077
[John] You'll bunk with another groom.

779
00:51:59.661 --> 00:52:02.497
They've agreed to pay you
a flat weekly rate at 200.

780
00:52:03.873 --> 00:52:04.874
Thank you.

781
00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:08.837
But. wait. why did they agree?

782
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:15.343
Well. I told them it would be beneficial
to Beauty's transition

783
00:52:15.427 --> 00:52:18.263
and much. much safer for the girl
if you were there.

784
00:52:21.725 --> 00:52:23.101
[woman] We're done. Ms. Green.

785
00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:27.564
All right.
See you in a couple weeks. Uncle John.

786
00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:39.075
[Black Beauty] At Birtwick. I learned that
it is good people who make good places.

787
00:52:42.579 --> 00:52:44.998
I felt lucky Ginger
was coming with us too.

788
00:52:49.794 --> 00:52:52.130
I wondered what our new home
would be like.

789
00:52:53.882 --> 00:52:54.883
Wow.

790
00:53:11.107 --> 00:53:13.234
-I can help if--
-I got it. Thanks.

791
00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:15.403
They're here! [chuckles]

792
00:53:15.487 --> 00:53:18.031
[man] Oh. Georgina. fine-looking horse
you have there.

793
00:53:18.114 --> 00:53:20.158
I'm proud you made the decision
to save her.

794
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:21.201
Can you take a photo?

795
00:53:22.285 --> 00:53:24.204
Not like that. Get my good side.

796
00:53:24.871 --> 00:53:26.873
[Black Beauty]
The new girl's voice was at a pitch

797
00:53:26.956 --> 00:53:29.167
I was sure only horses and dogs
could hear.

798
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.879
Not to be mean.
but it was a very terrible sound.

799
00:53:33.713 --> 00:53:36.091
You... you must be Jo?

800
00:53:36.174 --> 00:53:37.342
Yes.

801
00:53:37.425 --> 00:53:39.427
Mr. York. You'll report to me.

802
00:53:40.053 --> 00:53:42.347
Come on. I'll show you
your summer quarters.

803
00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:46.142
This way.

804
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.103
[Mrs. Winthorp] George!

805
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:54.275
George!

806
00:54:01.074 --> 00:54:03.368
[Black Beauty] Earlshall couldn't
have been more different to Birtwick.

807
00:54:03.451 --> 00:54:04.703
[horse whinnies]

808
00:54:04.786 --> 00:54:06.621
[Black Beauty] The aisles were spotless.

809
00:54:06.705 --> 00:54:08.790
The horses gleamed.

810
00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:15.296
But for all its perfection...

811
00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:20.927
something about Earlshall felt very cold
and not nearly as welcoming.

812
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:23.054
[Mrs. Winthorp whinnies]

813
00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:24.681
Here we are.

814
00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:26.307
[Jo sighs]

815
00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:28.101
-These are the grooms quarters?
-Yup.

816
00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:32.772
[Black Beauty] Ginger had been purchased.

817
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:34.816
I was only leased.

818
00:54:35.608 --> 00:54:38.945
Apparently you can try out a horse
to see if you like it.

819
00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:43.908
-[groans]
-[nickers]

820
00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:47.620
You don't have to kick her that hard.
She will walk.

821
00:54:47.704 --> 00:54:49.664
Let's just ease her into it. shall we?

822
00:54:49.748 --> 00:54:53.710
[Black Beauty] It was clear within
seconds. Georgina was nothing like Jo.

823
00:54:53.793 --> 00:54:56.588
Her hands were hard.
Her kicks were harder.

824
00:54:56.671 --> 00:55:00.884
And she flailed around like she was having
a tantrum on my back.

825
00:55:00.967 --> 00:55:02.052
-[Mr. York] Gently now.
-Come on.

826
00:55:02.135 --> 00:55:04.679
We want a nice collected frame.

827
00:55:06.014 --> 00:55:09.642
York! The dressage.
you're going to have to get her head up!

828
00:55:09.726 --> 00:55:10.935
My head is up. Mother.

829
00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:12.937
No. the horse. darling.

830
00:55:14.272 --> 00:55:17.067
Beauty's never been on a draw rein. ma'am.

831
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:20.195
Well. then you need to get her used to it
because she's not fit to be seen.

832
00:55:20.278 --> 00:55:21.571
[Mr. York sighs]

833
00:55:21.654 --> 00:55:23.656
Shoulder's back. Georgina.

834
00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.949
[Georgina sighs]

835
00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:35.168
She needs to look more like a show horse.
Cut her mane and tail.

836
00:55:42.592 --> 00:55:44.552
[Black Beauty] I tried to stay patient.

837
00:55:45.512 --> 00:55:49.015
I wondered how she'd feel
if they chopped off all of her hair.

838
00:55:52.727 --> 00:55:56.106
[Mr. York] The art of dressage
is to create a healthy horse.

839
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:59.984
We want to give her the freedom
to express herself.

840
00:56:00.068 --> 00:56:02.737
York. I'm really not in the mood today.
Canter. Beauty.

841
00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:04.072
[Black Beauty nickers]

842
00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:06.866
[Black Beauty whinnies]

843
00:56:10.745 --> 00:56:14.499
York. are you never
going to get the horses head up?

844
00:56:14.582 --> 00:56:18.294
I could take it up another degree. ma'am.
but I'd prefer not to.

845
00:56:18.378 --> 00:56:20.213
Oh. do it. please.

846
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:26.136
[Black Beauty] The only thing worse
than Georgina's kicks was the draw rein.

847
00:56:26.219 --> 00:56:30.223
It forced my head down into my chest
so I couldn't breathe naturally.

848
00:56:30.932 --> 00:56:33.893
-I tried to remember my training...
-What's she doing?

849
00:56:33.977 --> 00:56:36.312
...but the way I was treated
made me angry.

850
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:38.440
[nickers. whimpers]

851
00:56:38.523 --> 00:56:39.858
[Mr. York] Give her a head.

852
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:43.695
[Black Beauty] I knew that if I threw her
off. Jo and I would both be in trouble.

853
00:56:44.279 --> 00:56:47.407
-so I had a better idea.
-[Georgina] What's wrong with her?

854
00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.908
Georgina. what are you doing?

855
00:56:48.992 --> 00:56:51.494
Nothing. It's the stupid horse!

856
00:56:51.578 --> 00:56:53.538
-[nickers]
-[Georgina breathes heavily]

857
00:56:55.123 --> 00:56:56.666
That's it. Jump out the way.

858
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.293
What's she doing? Stupid horse!

859
00:56:59.627 --> 00:57:01.212
-Stupid horse!
-[Mr. York] Georgina. I've got--

860
00:57:03.757 --> 00:57:04.883
[Mr. York chuckles]

861
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.802
[Mr. York] Oh. Beauty. you're a cracker!

862
00:57:08.428 --> 00:57:09.429
[Mrs. Winthorp groans]

863
00:57:10.138 --> 00:57:12.849
What a wonderful horse you are!

864
00:57:12.932 --> 00:57:14.851
[horse whinnies]

865
00:57:14.934 --> 00:57:18.605
Well. my sister is definitely
not a horse woman.

866
00:57:22.442 --> 00:57:24.444
You wanna be tending to her. don't you?

867
00:57:26.821 --> 00:57:29.240
Grooming Beauty
is apparently above my station here.

868
00:57:32.535 --> 00:57:35.121
How are you finding things otherwise?

869
00:57:36.247 --> 00:57:39.793
Fine. Just trying to keep to myself.

870
00:57:40.794 --> 00:57:41.836
Birtwick was one thing.

871
00:57:42.587 --> 00:57:46.174
This is [sighs] definitely not my world.

872
00:57:47.467 --> 00:57:52.138
It's a big place. but that doesn't mean
the people are any different.

873
00:57:53.765 --> 00:57:55.392
Not all of us anyway.

874
00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.814
I'll speak to York about you
tending to Beauty.

875
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:03.358
She's your horse. in my opinion.

876
00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:07.320
I'll see you around.

877
00:58:11.825 --> 00:58:13.827
[horse whinnies in distance]

878
00:58:25.505 --> 00:58:29.634
I heard my son put a word in so
that you could spend time with the horse.

879
00:58:29.718 --> 00:58:32.012
Yes. um...

880
00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:33.430
Thank you. I--

881
00:58:33.513 --> 00:58:35.682
Unfortunately it's inappropriate.

882
00:58:35.765 --> 00:58:37.809
And it's upsetting Georgina.

883
00:58:37.892 --> 00:58:41.187
so [sighs] you're going to need
to keep your distance.

884
00:58:42.689 --> 00:58:45.191
You wouldn't want to compromise
your place here. would you?

885
00:58:45.275 --> 00:58:47.527
No. no. Of course not.

886
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:49.237
Good. then we understand each other.

887
00:58:49.988 --> 00:58:51.406
About appropriate distance.

888
00:58:55.118 --> 00:58:56.327
[footsteps departing]

889
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:04.377
[Black Beauty] I didn't think Georgina
would wanna ride me again after that.

890
00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:05.837
but she did.

891
00:59:09.299 --> 00:59:10.800
Now you'll listen. won't you?

892
00:59:12.135 --> 00:59:15.597
[Black Beauty] She dug her spurs into me
like I was made of stone.

893
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:19.059
And if it wasn't for Jo.

894
00:59:19.142 --> 00:59:22.729
I would've thrown that horrible girl
off my back.

[nickers]

896
00:59:30.362 --> 00:59:31.488
Hi. girl.

[gasps]

898
00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:40.747
Oh. Beauty.

899
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:44.793
What did she do to you?

900
00:59:48.338 --> 00:59:50.340
-[George] Jo!
-Where is she?

901
00:59:50.423 --> 00:59:52.175
Who? What happened?

902
00:59:52.258 --> 00:59:54.928
Your sister put holes into Beauty's sides.
and I'm gonna show her exactly--

903
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:56.429
Whoa. Wait. wait. Slow down.

904
00:59:57.555 --> 00:59:58.807
Tell me what happened.

905
01:00:00.725 --> 01:00:01.726
Oh. my God.

906

[Black Beauty nickers]

907
01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:07.607
That is not okay.
We do not abuse horses at our stable.

908
01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:13.488
Here. dab some of that onto them.
It'll make her heal faster.

909
01:00:15.448 --> 01:00:18.576
Thanks for your help. really.
But now I need to find your--

910
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.370
[George] Jo. please.

911
01:00:20.453 --> 01:00:23.039
I'll talk to York and my mother.
I promise.

912
01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:28.503
Besides. Beauty needs you here. not fired.

913
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:35.844
[horse whinnies]

914
01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:40.265
[Jo] I know he's-- He's nice and...

915
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:42.350
smart.

916
01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:51.776
And very...

917
01:00:53.236 --> 01:00:55.363

01:00:56.406 --> 01:00:58.158
-Hey.
-Hi.

919
01:00:58.908 --> 01:01:01.244
I wanted to ask if you'd like
to have lunch with me.

920
01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:05.373
I'm fine. I'd rather spend
my one day off with Beauty.

921
01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:07.584
[Black Beauty]
I decided to give them some space.

922
01:01:07.667 --> 01:01:08.626
I figured.

923
01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:10.754
[Jo chuckles]

924
01:01:16.801 --> 01:01:19.220
So. what's your story?

925
01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:22.057
I don't really have a story.

926
01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.641
Everyone has a story.

927
01:01:24.476 --> 01:01:25.477
Where are you from?

928
01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:29.898
What's a beautiful girl like you
doing working as a groom?

929
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:32.525
-[Jo chuckles]
-You know. the basics.

[horse whinnies in distance]

931
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:36.613
I'd rather not talk about my past.
if that's okay.

932
01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:37.822
Fair enough.

933
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:40.075
How about the future?

934
01:01:41.242 --> 01:01:43.078
What do you wanna do in ten years?

935
01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:46.331
You can pick anything. I'll start.

936
01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:47.624
[horse whinnies in distance]

937
01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.877
I would colonize Mars.

938
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.379
[both chuckle]

939
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:59.094
Well. I would rescue horses.
Like what my uncle's doing at Birtwick.

940
01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:02.681
Except. you know.
I'd buy the properties around it.

941
01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:04.933
extend the barn
so we could stay a little more.

942
01:02:05.016 --> 01:02:07.060
Sorry. it's probably really boring.

943
01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:08.311
No.

944
01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:09.979
I'm fascinated.

945
01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:21.199
So. I've been reading about how there
are thousands of wild horses out west.

946
01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:25.036
and they're being rounded up by
helicopters and stuffed into holding pens.

947
01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.664
just hoping that people will adopt them.

948
01:02:27.747 --> 01:02:30.875
but most of them
are just stuck in there forever.

949
01:02:32.669 --> 01:02:36.172
I can't imagine what would've happened
to Beauty if my uncle didn't save her.

950
01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:43.138
So I guess I would buy Birtwick
and help save thousands of wild horses.

951
01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:45.765
With Beauty as the mascot.

952
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.185
That is a way better answer than Mars.

[both chuckle]

954
01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:52.439
Bet you do it.

annual Earlshall Classic this weekend.

They wore the funniest hats.

And I loved the music.
It made me wanna dance.

-It is casual.

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:39.642
-Without my shoe. jumping was dangerous.
-Come on. Go!

1049
01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:42.562
Still. she forced me to keep going.

1050
01:07:42.645 --> 01:07:44.189
[Georgina] Come on. Come on.

1051
01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:48.193
[Georgina groans]

1052
01:07:55.408 --> 01:07:57.327
[Georgina] Faster!

1053
01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:05.585
[Black Beauty whinnies]

1054
01:08:05.669 --> 01:08:07.170
-[crowd] Oh!
-[Jo gasps]

1055
01:08:08.838 --> 01:08:10.674
[Black Beauty whinnies]

1056
01:08:12.509 --> 01:08:14.386
Oh. my God. Darling. run!

1057
01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:16.221
-Beauty!
-[woman] Don't worry.

1058
01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:18.348
Only thing that's bruised is her ego.

1059
01:08:18.431 --> 01:08:19.808
[Georgina pants. grunts]

1060
01:08:22.477 --> 01:08:23.895
Useless horse! We could've won!

1061
01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:29.567
She was limping at the first turn.
but you forced her to keep going.

1062
01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:30.694
[Black Beauty nickers]

1063
01:08:30.777 --> 01:08:32.445
Did you even know her shoe was loose?

1064
01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.740
Selfish girl! Putting your life
and the horse's in danger.

1065
01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:38.076
[Mrs. Winthorp] Aw. Georgina.
Are you all right?

1066
01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:39.661
-Does it hurt?
-[Georgina cries]

1067
01:08:39.744 --> 01:08:41.287
[Mrs. Winthorp] Come on. Come with Mummy.

1068
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:42.789
-Are you all right?
-[Georgina] No!

1069
01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:45.083
[Mrs. Winthorp]
Of course she's not all right!

1070
01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:47.043
Oh. Beauty.

1071
01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:50.213
I know. I know. Come on.

1072
01:08:57.846 --> 01:09:00.473
Good girl. Good girl.

1073
01:09:01.307 --> 01:09:03.935
She didn't break a leg. miraculously.

1074
01:09:04.686 --> 01:09:07.856
Whoever did this.
shouldn't be around horses.

1075
01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:11.943
Unfortunately these scars
will last for a lifetime.

1076
01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:14.320
-but there is a surgery if you want me--
-No. no. no.

1077
01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:16.406
We're not spending any more money
on this horse.

1078
01:09:16.489 --> 01:09:19.951
I told you that we shouldn't have brought
a mustang into our stables.

1079
01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:21.536
Just send it back.

1080
01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:24.330
Y-You-- You can't do that. Mother. Jo--

1081
01:09:24.414 --> 01:09:27.959
I can do whatever I want. George.
And stay away from the help.

1082
01:09:28.043 --> 01:09:30.086
-The help?
-Yes. George. The help.

1083
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.255
Jo is ten times the person you are.

1084
01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:36.217
[Black Beauty]
Our time at Earlshall had tested us.

1085
01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:37.302
[Mrs. Winthorp] George!

1086
01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.596
[Black Beauty]
But Jo and I were stronger because of it.

1087
01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:43.183
I respected George for standing up
to his mother.

1088
01:09:43.266 --> 01:09:44.267
[Mrs. Winthorp] George!

1089
01:09:44.351 --> 01:09:48.563
[Black Beauty] He had inherited her good
breeding but none of her nasty spirit.

1090
01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:55.612
Jo had worked so hard.
and it was almost time to go home.

1091
01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:58.615
But I would miss Ginger.

1092
01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:08.208
So. I've saved up over $800.
and I've done the math.

1093
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.585
It should be enough
to pay back Mr. Gordon.

1094
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:14.089
and if I just keep going.
I can finally take her away from here.

1095
01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:15.173
Jo.

1096
01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:20.178
Wait. why are you visiting again?

1097
01:10:21.137 --> 01:10:22.639
I have terrible news.

1098
01:10:26.184 --> 01:10:29.020
[Black Beauty]
Birtwick was closing down for good.

1099
01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:33.024
All of the animals in it
were going to be sold.

1100
01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:35.527
You're my family.

1101
01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:38.905
You know that. right?

1102
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.534
I'm gonna find you.

1103
01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:46.371
I'm gonna save up enough money.
and I'm gonna find you.

1104
01:10:46.996 --> 01:10:50.291
[Black Beauty]
My heart stopped. My legs went numb.

1105
01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.543
I promise.

1106
01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:54.504
[Black Beauty]
I felt like I couldn't even breathe.

1107
01:10:55.922 --> 01:10:57.340
Jo was leaving me?

1108
01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:06.057
[horse whinnies]

1109
01:11:14.649 --> 01:11:16.901
-[Black Beauty] I cried. I screamed.
-Wait!

1110
01:11:16.985 --> 01:11:18.737
[horse whinnies]

1111
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.656
Wait! Beauty!

1112
01:11:22.282 --> 01:11:25.869
[Black Beauty] I pounded my hooves against
that trailer to get them to stop.

1113
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:31.374
-But it was just too late.
-[Jo panting]

1114
01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:36.129
The only thing I could do was look back
at Jo's sweet face

1115
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.717
as she disappeared
from my life completely.

1116
01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:50.810
[horse nickers]

1117
01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:53.688
[Black Beauty]
Losing Jo made my old anger come back.

1118
01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:57.067
I began to bite and kick.

1119
01:11:57.942 --> 01:12:00.612
anything I could do to make them
send me home.

1120
01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:04.282
-Hey.
-[Black Beauty] But my plan didn't work.

1121
01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:05.784
What's up. pretty lady?

1122
01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:08.536
-My new owner liked the fire in me.
-Yeah.

1123
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.746
[horse whinnies]

1124
01:12:09.829 --> 01:12:13.875
[John] I never thought I'd say goodbye
to Birtwick. I'm so sorry. Jo.

1125
01:12:17.253 --> 01:12:22.509
A few years ago. I fell in love
with this little bay mustang

1126
01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:25.053
we rescued from the BLM in Nevada.

1127
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:29.557
He was half-starved but so darn pretty.

1128
01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:32.644
I called him Beau.

1129
01:12:33.603 --> 01:12:37.190
They say horses pick you.
and Beau picked me.

1130
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.486
I trained him up right.
and he was a perfect horse.

1131
01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:46.991
Boy. I cried like a baby
when we gave him away.

1132
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.536
And you didn't fight to keep him?

1133
01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:55.875
If I'd fought for every horse
I'd ever loved.

1134
01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.836
I'd have a hundred of 'em.

1135
01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:00.463
I don't want a hundred horses.

1136
01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:04.384
I just want one.

1137
01:13:06.052 --> 01:13:09.222
I'm gonna get Beauty back.
Uncle John. no matter what.

1138
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:17.647
[Black Beauty]
I was bought by a man named Terry

1139
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:20.734
to help him search for people
lost in the mountains.

1140
01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:27.073
Being in nature again brought up
old memories of when I was wild.

1141
01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:30.869
It seemed like a lifetime ago.

1142
01:13:33.163 --> 01:13:36.791
Terry was a quiet man and good to me.

1143
01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:39.544
but I couldn't help
but think Jo had been right.

1144
01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:40.879
[wolf howling]

1145
01:13:40.962 --> 01:13:44.341
[Black Beauty] We should've run away
together when we had the chance.

1146
01:13:44.841 --> 01:13:47.260
[man] Fell for a pretty. little mustang.
hey. Terry?

1147
01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:49.512
[woman] Well. I think she's lovely.

1148
01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:50.555
[Terry] Mm-hmm.

1149
01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:53.266
-And more accustomed to this kinda terra.
-[nickers]

1150
01:13:57.312 --> 01:13:59.939
[Black Beauty] My new life required
a different side of me.

1151
01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:04.736
I had to be bolder and more fearless
than ever before.

1152
01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.031
It's getting a little dicey here.

1153
01:14:09.491 --> 01:14:11.493
[Terry] She can do it. Come on.

1154
01:14:11.576 --> 01:14:14.329
Come on. That's my brave horse.

1155
01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:15.955
Terry. stop. It's too steep.

1156
01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:18.208
[horse nickers]

1157
01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:25.298
[Black Beauty] I spent two years
in the mountains with Terry...

1158
01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.635
and we did many brave rescues.

1159
01:14:30.887 --> 01:14:33.556
It was hard. lonely work...

1160
01:14:35.266 --> 01:14:37.686
but I learned new lessons
about being selfless.

1161
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:45.443
Terry and I risked our lives every day
for people we'd never met.

1162
01:14:45.527 --> 01:14:49.531
That's my girl. That's my girl.

1163
01:14:51.157 --> 01:14:55.745
[Black Beauty] If Jo could see me now.
I hope she would be proud of me.

1164
01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:57.539
[man screams]

1165
01:14:57.622 --> 01:14:59.791
[man] Hey! Help me. please!

1166
01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:01.042
[Terry] Hang on in there!

1167
01:15:01.626 --> 01:15:02.752
Hold on in there!

1168
01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:04.671
-Please hurry!
-[Terry] I'm coming!

1169
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:06.881
My leg is stuck!

1170
01:15:08.341 --> 01:15:11.136
[Black Beauty]
I stood my ground the best I could...

1171
01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:15.015
but the will of the river
was just so strong.

1172
01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:15.974
[Terry] I got ya!

1173
01:15:16.057 --> 01:15:20.770
[Black Beauty] But Terry was determined
to save that man. and so was I.

1174
01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:22.355
[Terry] Hold tight there! I'm coming!

1175
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:24.190
[Black Beauty whinnies]

1176
01:15:25.483 --> 01:15:27.235
[Terry grunts]

1177
01:15:30.363 --> 01:15:32.907
[Black Beauty] Only once in my life
had I seen a river overflow.

1178
01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:35.952
-and it wiped out everything in its path.
-[man] Please!

1179
01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.079
My leg is stuck! I can't move it!

1180
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:43.001
[whinnies]

1181
01:15:43.084 --> 01:15:46.212
[Black Beauty] The water was coming down
the mountain too fast.

1182
01:15:47.255 --> 01:15:49.424
-[Terry] You're gonna have to help me!
-Okay.

1183
01:15:49.507 --> 01:15:50.467
[Black Beauty] He had to hurry.

1184
01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:53.428
[man groans]

1185
01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:55.305
[Terry] Hold on!

1186
01:15:58.933 --> 01:15:59.934
[nickers]

1187
01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:01.269
[man grunting]

1188
01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:07.233
-[man] Come on!
-[whinnies]

1189
01:16:09.027 --> 01:16:10.445
[Black Beauty]
We weren't going to make it.

1190
01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:13.198
[Terry panting]

1191
01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:18.078
[Terry] Save yourself. girl.

1192
01:16:19.704 --> 01:16:20.997
[Terry grunts]

1193
01:16:24.417 --> 01:16:25.669
[grunting continues]

1194
01:16:27.921 --> 01:16:30.590
[Black Beauty] I didn't know if a mustang
had ever outrun a river...

1195
01:16:32.092 --> 01:16:33.927
but I was going to try.

1196
01:16:50.944 --> 01:16:51.903
[Terry gasps]

1197
01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:54.197
[Terry] Come on!

1198
01:17:09.587 --> 01:17:10.922
[Black Beauty whinnies]

1199
01:17:13.174 --> 01:17:16.011
[gasping]

1200
01:17:19.305 --> 01:17:21.975
[man on radio]
Engine 5. Dispatch. Requesting backup.

1201
01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:24.185
[Black Beauty] We had done it.

1202
01:17:24.269 --> 01:17:25.270
[Terry grunts]

1203
01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:27.647
[Black Beauty]
I had never galloped as fast

1204
01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:29.524
or as hard in my life as I did that day.

1205
01:17:30.358 --> 01:17:32.027
We've gotta get you to the hospital.

1206
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:34.654
[Black Beauty]
And I was proud to be Terry's partner.

1207
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:36.406
Don't worry. sir. We'll tend to her.

1208
01:17:36.489 --> 01:17:38.992
Tanner. get the horse's bridle
and saddle off.

1209
01:17:39.075 --> 01:17:40.827
and make sure she has plenty to drink.

1210
01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:44.622
She was a hero today.
Come on. sir. Let's get going.

1211
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:47.292
[Black Beauty] I think Jo
would have been proud of us too.

1212
01:17:49.377 --> 01:17:52.464
Goodness. girl. Your coat's on fire.

1213
01:17:52.547 --> 01:17:53.631
[nickers]

1214
01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:55.925
Okay. Come.

1215
01:17:57.093 --> 01:18:01.931
[Black Beauty] Like the freezing river
water. the cold air rushed into my lungs.

1216
01:18:04.809 --> 01:18:07.228
But the man didn't know anything
about horses.

1217
01:18:08.646 --> 01:18:11.900
So. he left me without my blanket.

1218
01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:18.698
My legs began to shake so hard
I couldn't even stand.

1219
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:23.203
I turned cold all over.

1220
01:18:25.955 --> 01:18:27.040
[horse whinnies]

1221
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:31.169
[Black Beauty growls]

1222
01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:34.214
No. No. stupid kid.

1223
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:36.383
Stupid kid.

1224
01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:41.179
[sobs] My brave horse.

1225
01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:46.518
Come on. my girl. Get up. Get up.

1226
01:18:49.479 --> 01:18:53.149
It's colic. Her lungs are badly inflamed.
I've given her something for the pain.

1227
01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:56.820
Let's hope she has the strength
to make it through.

1228
01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:07.956
[Black Beauty] Terry stayed with me
all night as my mind went into a haze.

1229
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.502
I fought to stay awake...

1230
01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:16.506
but I could feel my spirit slipping.

1231
01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:25.181
Then... I saw Jo.

1232
01:19:35.233 --> 01:19:36.735
[Jo] Just hold on for me.

1233
01:19:41.698 --> 01:19:42.907
I'm gonna find you.

1234
01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.661
I promise.

1235
01:19:48.747 --> 01:19:50.165
I'm gonna find you.

1236
01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:53.626
I love you. Beauty.

1237
01:19:56.671 --> 01:19:58.673
[Black Beauty]
I don't know if it was a dream...

1238
01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.135
or if Jo had managed to find me somehow.

1239
01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:03.595
[Black Beauty nickers]

1240
01:20:05.597 --> 01:20:07.015
[nickering continues]

1241
01:20:07.098 --> 01:20:08.183
[Terry whispering] You're up.

1242
01:20:08.266 --> 01:20:11.227
-[Black Beauty] Terry was a good man.
-Oh. my. My girl. you are up.

1243
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:13.646
[Black Beauty]
But he was getting older like me.

1244
01:20:15.482 --> 01:20:17.150
He decided to retire.

1245
01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.487
So. I was sold again.

1246
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:27.118
I was sent to a place
so far in the country.

1247
01:20:27.202 --> 01:20:30.121
the farmers still used old tools to work.

1248
01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:37.128
He had promised Terry he would take
good care of me. but the farmer lied.

1249
01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:39.756
[thunder rumbling]

1250
01:20:39.839 --> 01:20:41.466
[Black Beauty] When I felt like giving up.

1251
01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:44.844
something my mother said
kept coming back to me.

1252
01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:49.849
When she told me it was impossible
to break a mustang's spirit...

1253
01:20:51.685 --> 01:20:54.354
and that if things ever got really hard...

1254
01:20:56.439 --> 01:21:01.695
that I should close my eyes
and dream of only good things...

1255
01:21:03.196 --> 01:21:05.615
and that good things would return.

1256
01:21:07.283 --> 01:21:09.285
I dreamed of Jo.

1257
01:21:14.124 --> 01:21:19.129
I remembered back
to when we were young... and free.

1258
01:21:21.047 --> 01:21:22.966
But it had been so long.

1259
01:21:24.092 --> 01:21:25.760
Would she even remember me?

1260
01:21:28.722 --> 01:21:33.393
I tried to imagine
where Jo could be right now.

1261
01:21:38.815 --> 01:21:39.816
[Jo] Dear Uncle John...

1262
01:21:42.652 --> 01:21:45.864
Winter in the city really is beautiful.

1263
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:48.700
I've been working extra shifts.

1264
01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:52.203
and I've almost saved up
enough money to buy Beauty back.

1265
01:21:53.538 --> 01:21:56.041
But now. I can't seem to find her.

1266
01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.544
It's like she disappeared.

1267
01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:03.840
[Black Beauty]
I knew it was just another dream.

1268
01:22:03.923 --> 01:22:08.636
but some days. when I thought
I could almost hear Jo's voice.

1269
01:22:09.387 --> 01:22:16.353
I whinnied as loudly as I could just
in case somehow she could hear me too.

1270
01:22:17.103 --> 01:22:21.733
[Jo] I'll never stop searching for her.
Love. Jo.

1271
01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:35.789
[Black Beauty] It had been almost
seven years since I'd last seen Jo.

1272
01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.584
We bought a horse.

1273
01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:42.170
[Black Beauty]
But hope can be a very powerful thing

1274
01:22:42.253 --> 01:22:44.964
if you can manage to hang on to it.

1275
01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:47.384
Bit more broken up than we want her to be.
yeah. Jerry?

1276
01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:49.594
Dolly picked her out. actually.

1277
01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:53.139
She's beautiful underneath.
She's just tired. That's all.

1278
01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:56.101
[woman] You're right. honey. You should
never judge a book by its cover.

1279
01:22:59.062 --> 01:23:01.064
[Black Beauty] My new stall
was the smallest I'd ever been in.

1280
01:23:01.147 --> 01:23:02.232
[Jerry] Easy now. There you go.

1281
01:23:02.315 --> 01:23:04.025
[Black Beauty]
And there were no pastures in sight.

1282
01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:04.943
[Jerry] That's it.

1283
01:23:05.026 --> 01:23:06.820
[Black Beauty] Only concrete and walls.

1284
01:23:06.903 --> 01:23:08.530
Let's get her settled in.

1285
01:23:08.613 --> 01:23:11.449
[Black Beauty] I was scared
to be left alone in that place.

1286
01:23:11.533 --> 01:23:13.159
[Black Beauty nickers]

1287
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:28.133
[Black Beauty] Dolly reminded me of Jo.
and her touch was kind.

1288
01:23:28.216 --> 01:23:29.467
It's okay.

1289
01:23:30.176 --> 01:23:32.512
[Black Beauty]
Like she knew exactly how to calm me.

1290
01:23:35.348 --> 01:23:37.100
Slow down around the horses.

1291
01:23:38.643 --> 01:23:41.521
I bet she was an amazing horse
when she was younger.

1292
01:23:41.604 --> 01:23:44.524
And she will be again
with some good treatment.

1293
01:23:45.608 --> 01:23:47.402
What do you think we should name her. Jer?

1294
01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:50.613
I was thinking Jackie. after the old one.
What do you think. guys?

1295
01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:53.783
How about Lady? Because she's so elegant.

1296
01:23:54.951 --> 01:23:56.703
Then the name is all hers.

1297
01:23:56.786 --> 01:23:59.664
[Jerry] That's a great idea. Dolly.
Lady it is.

1298
01:23:59.748 --> 01:24:01.082
[boy] Lady.

1299
01:24:08.631 --> 01:24:11.384
Take your time. You're not in any rush.

1300
01:24:12.093 --> 01:24:14.554
[Black Beauty] The carriage was strange
to pull at first...

1301
01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.098
but Jerry didn't force me.

1302
01:24:18.016 --> 01:24:19.017
[man] What can I get ya?

1303
01:24:20.393 --> 01:24:24.939
[Black Beauty] I came to like the park
and all the faces in it.

1304
01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:29.611
I knew I had found my way to the city
for a reason.

1305
01:24:37.077 --> 01:24:40.622
I couldn't believe how many people
visited that place.

1306
01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:42.916
-Thousands.
-[Jerry] Good girl.

1307
01:24:42.999 --> 01:24:47.837
[Black Beauty] And so I was sure.
that somehow. I would find Jo.

1308
01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:49.673
[chattering]

1309
01:24:50.256 --> 01:24:54.344
[Black Beauty] I missed her so much
that I started seeing her everywhere.

1310
01:24:54.427 --> 01:24:57.138
[Jerry] Whoa now. What's going on. Lady?

1311
01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:00.016
You looking for someone?

1312
01:25:02.143 --> 01:25:04.270
-Want me to take you to brunch?
-[nickers]

1313
01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:06.231
[Jerry] Walk on.

1314
01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:09.609
[Black Beauty]
But I would not give up hope.

1315
01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:13.863
I knew in my heart I would find her.

1316
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.749
Every day. I looked.

1317
01:25:49.399 --> 01:25:51.359
I knew that horse.

1318
01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:54.696
It was Ginger.

1319
01:25:54.779 --> 01:25:56.322
[Ginger nickers]

1320
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:59.993
[Black Beauty]
I couldn't believe how much she'd changed.

1321
01:26:00.076 --> 01:26:01.244
[Black Beauty nickers]

1322
01:26:01.327 --> 01:26:06.332
[Black Beauty] Ginger's once powerful body
was just skin and bones.

1323
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:12.547
The fire and life in her eyes
had been replaced by deep sadness.

1324
01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:17.927
She told me she had won
many prizes for George.

1325
01:26:18.011 --> 01:26:19.721
but when he left for school.

1326
01:26:20.472 --> 01:26:24.476
his mother had sold her
without him even knowing.

1327
01:26:25.935 --> 01:26:29.272
-Hey. how much for a ride?
-[carriage driver] I'm your man. boys.

1328
01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:33.151
[Black Beauty] While my mustang heart
could endure that hard life

1329
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.653
just for the hope of seeing Jo again...

1330
01:26:37.447 --> 01:26:40.909
I knew Ginger didn't have someone
to hope for anymore.

1331
01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:46.498
I also knew it was the last time
I would ever see her.

1332
01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:49.334
-[carriage driver] Okay. Come on.
-[Ginger nickers]

1333
01:26:49.417 --> 01:26:52.796
[Black Beauty] I'll never forget
Ginger's final words to me.

1334
01:26:52.879 --> 01:26:53.880
[carriage driver] Careful.

1335
01:26:53.963 --> 01:26:59.969
[Black Beauty] She said Merrylegs and I
were the only friends she ever had.

1336
01:27:00.053 --> 01:27:01.054
[Jerry] Move on.

1337
01:27:05.058 --> 01:27:06.643
[Black Beauty nickers]

1338
01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:12.524
Beauty?

1339
01:27:13.316 --> 01:27:14.401
[Jerry] Move on. Lady.

1340
01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:21.282
Good girl. Good girl.

1341
01:27:23.576 --> 01:27:27.080
Thanks for getting through
a rough night. girl. You're a good--

1342
01:27:27.163 --> 01:27:30.166
[Jerry coughing]

1343
01:27:36.047 --> 01:27:37.632
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1344
01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:39.759
[Black Beauty] But Jerry wasn't fine.

1345
01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:41.803
[coughing continues]

1346
01:27:41.886 --> 01:27:45.724
[Black Beauty] The cold had climbed
into his lungs. just like when I was sick.

1347
01:27:57.068 --> 01:27:58.319
Hello. lovely one.

1348
01:27:58.403 --> 01:27:59.738
Nice looking horse.

1349
01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:03.324
The doctor said Jerry can't drive
for the rest of the winter.

1350
01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:05.160
maybe even until spring.

1351
01:28:06.703 --> 01:28:07.912
We need the money.

1352
01:28:08.788 --> 01:28:10.457
I can put her into my rotation.

1353
01:28:13.251 --> 01:28:14.419
All right.

1354
01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:16.796
[Black Beauty] After I was taken from Jo.

1355
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.466
I didn't think my life
could get any worse...

1356
01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:22.052
but I was wrong.

1357
01:28:22.135 --> 01:28:25.388
[man] Nice and slow. Come on. That's okay.

1358
01:28:25.472 --> 01:28:28.975
[Black Beauty] The smells in that stable
reeked of mold and old hay.

1359
01:28:29.059 --> 01:28:30.143
[horses whinnying]

1360
01:28:30.226 --> 01:28:33.480
[Black Beauty]
The horses were mean from bad treatment.

1361
01:28:33.563 --> 01:28:35.982
I couldn't imagine what they'd want
from me next.

1362
01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:37.317
Buenas noches. Lady.

1363
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.448
[Black Beauty] The rotation meant
I was on my feet day and night.

1364
01:28:44.407 --> 01:28:46.326
-Jerry had been kind...
-Whoa. whoa. Easy.

1365
01:28:46.409 --> 01:28:48.661
-...and most drivers were like him...
-Easy. easy.

1366
01:28:48.745 --> 01:28:51.498
...but not all people
in the world are good.

1367
01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:53.583
-[chattering]
-[horn honks]

1368
01:28:58.922 --> 01:29:00.131
Come on.

1369
01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:12.602
[Black Beauty] I knew it was Ginger.

1370
01:29:14.938 --> 01:29:17.774
She was at peace at last.

1371
01:29:17.857 --> 01:29:20.485
[horse whinnies]

1372
01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:22.737
[Black Beauty]
How could some people not understand

1373
01:29:22.821 --> 01:29:25.073
that horses can feel what they do?

1374
01:29:25.699 --> 01:29:28.910
Jo knew that I could feel love
and sadness.

1375
01:29:28.993 --> 01:29:30.453
[carriage driver]
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1376
01:29:31.579 --> 01:29:35.250
[Black Beauty] But others thought it was
okay to just throw a horse's life away

1377
01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:36.418
like it meant nothing.

1378
01:29:39.254 --> 01:29:41.089
And that broke my heart.

1379
01:29:44.384 --> 01:29:47.721
I mean. where are the years that a horse
could work eight. ten hours a day?

1380
01:29:47.804 --> 01:29:49.139
But that was too many hours. Tom.

1381
01:29:49.222 --> 01:29:52.434
as evidenced by the fact that your horse
was outside on the streets yesterday.

1382
01:30:05.238 --> 01:30:06.823
-[phone rings]
-[Tom sighs]

1383
01:30:09.534 --> 01:30:10.535
Midtown Stables.

1384
01:30:11.745 --> 01:30:14.330
Nope. No black horse in my barn.

1385
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.543
Yeah. yeah. I saw the papers.
Yeah. it's just terrible.

1386
01:30:19.252 --> 01:30:22.130
I bet you were hermosa back in your day.

1387
01:30:22.213 --> 01:30:23.548
Means pretty.

1388
01:30:23.631 --> 01:30:25.300
[Tom] Sure. sure. I'll ask around.

1389
01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:33.183
You're a famous horse now. See?

1390
01:30:33.933 --> 01:30:35.310
[Tom] She's useless if she can't work.

1391
01:30:35.393 --> 01:30:39.105
I have a guy who can take...
you know. take care of her.

1392
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:42.776
Yeah. but if you put her out to pasture.
she should recover in a couple of months.

1393
01:30:42.859 --> 01:30:44.444
[Tom] Not worth the money.

1394
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:46.071
-[phone rings]
-Nah.

1395
01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:49.324
Midtown Stables.

1396
01:30:50.408 --> 01:30:54.162
No. miss. I'm sorry. I really don't know
anything about that horse.

1397
01:30:55.663 --> 01:31:00.418
Just really terrible. Oh. sure. sure.
I'll-- I'll ask around.

1398
01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:05.298
Even more reason to be rid of it.

1399
01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:08.468
Hey. What are you doing in there?
Get back to work.

1400
01:31:08.551 --> 01:31:09.928
Yes. sir.

1401
01:31:11.888 --> 01:31:14.224
Well. Mr. Skinner.
thanks for coming around here.

1402
01:31:14.307 --> 01:31:16.976
[Mr. Skinner] I have this huge land.
I can take as many as you can give.

1403
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.020
[Tom] Here's the first one.
She's gotten lame on me.

1404
01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:22.899
The front leg. She's about 1.200 pounds.

1405
01:31:22.982 --> 01:31:26.528
This is what we agreed on for her.
and here's the other one we talked about.

1406
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:27.612
[Mr. Skinner] What. over there?

1407
01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:30.615
[Tom] You should happily take her.
We got a deal?

1408
01:31:30.699 --> 01:31:32.450
-[Mr. Skinner] Absolutely.
-Great.

1409
01:31:32.534 --> 01:31:35.120
-Well. let me take you to the office.
-[Mr. Skinner] Now listen.

1410
01:31:35.203 --> 01:31:37.330
-You got any more. just phone me. okay?
-[Tom] For sure.

1411
01:31:37.414 --> 01:31:39.541
[Black Beauty]
I knew something bad was coming...

1412
01:31:41.167 --> 01:31:44.754
but I felt more sorry
for the little bay mare.

1413
01:31:44.838 --> 01:31:48.341
who was so exhausted.
she didn't care what happened to her.

1414
01:31:49.926 --> 01:31:54.556
I wondered if she ever had someone
to love her like Jo had loved me.

1415
01:31:55.849 --> 01:32:01.479
And I wished. somehow.
I could see her just one last time.

1416
01:32:02.022 --> 01:32:04.024
[phone rings]

1417
01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:08.945
Hello.

1418
01:32:13.491 --> 01:32:16.244
A white star. Yes. she does.

1419
01:32:23.293 --> 01:32:26.129
[man] Let's make this fast.
I don't like being here with these things.

1420
01:32:26.212 --> 01:32:27.922
[Black Beauty nickers]

1421
01:32:34.387 --> 01:32:36.431
-[man 2] Which one?
-That's her there.

1422
01:32:37.307 --> 01:32:39.309
What the hell? Back.
Let's get back in there.

1423
01:32:40.685 --> 01:32:41.686
[man 3] Stand still.

1424
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:43.730
[Black Beauty]
I knew they had come for me.

1425
01:32:44.564 --> 01:32:46.066
[nickers]

1426
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:49.527
[Black Beauty] But if it really was
the end. I wouldn't make it easy on them.

1427
01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:50.528
Whoa!

1428
01:32:52.238 --> 01:32:54.032
-[grunts]
-[Black Beauty whinnies]

1429
01:32:54.115 --> 01:32:54.991
[man 3] Back up. horse!

1430
01:32:55.617 --> 01:33:00.580
[Black Beauty] I was a mustang.
strong and proud and wild.

1431
01:33:00.663 --> 01:33:03.249
And I would defend myself
until my final breath.

1432
01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:05.627
-Jo would have wanted that.
-Get back. horse!

1433
01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:07.671
[Black Beauty] My mother would have too.

1434
01:33:07.754 --> 01:33:10.006
[woman] My God. how did this pass code?

1435
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:12.550
[policeman 1] Let's see some ID. fellas.

1436
01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:14.469
We've heard some rumors
about horses disappearing.

1437
01:33:14.552 --> 01:33:16.680
-[Policeman 1] Come on. Let me see.
-[man 3] I've done nothing wrong.

1438
01:33:16.763 --> 01:33:17.764
-[man 4] Come on.
-Let me see your ID.

1439
01:33:17.847 --> 01:33:19.474
-[policeman 1] Have to take you in. man.
-[man 3] This is wrong.

1440
01:33:19.557 --> 01:33:21.226
-[policewoman] Let us decide that.
-[policeman 2] Seriously? Stop.

1441
01:33:21.309 --> 01:33:23.603
It doesn't matter. ma'am.
All right? Just--

1442
01:33:23.687 --> 01:33:25.563
-[Jo] Please. Just let me go.
-[policewoman] Let the girl go!

1443
01:33:26.523 --> 01:33:27.524
Really.

1444
01:33:41.454 --> 01:33:42.455
Beauty?

1445
01:33:47.961 --> 01:33:49.045
Is that you. girl?

1446
01:33:54.801 --> 01:33:55.802
It's okay.

1447
01:33:59.723 --> 01:34:00.724
It's me.

1448
01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.561
It's Jo.

1449
01:34:06.062 --> 01:34:08.732
[Black Beauty] Was it just another dream?

1450
01:34:15.405 --> 01:34:16.990
[whispering] Oh. my Beauty.

1451
01:34:18.324 --> 01:34:20.076
I promised I'd find you.

1452
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:24.039
[Black Beauty] It was really her.

1453
01:34:25.999 --> 01:34:27.709
My Jo.

1454
01:34:29.586 --> 01:34:30.587
[whispering] My Beauty.

1455
01:34:35.967 --> 01:34:38.970
[Black Beauty]
That was the happiest day of my life.

1456
01:34:40.221 --> 01:34:46.227
And I finally understood what it was that
kept Jo and I connected all that time.

1457
01:34:47.437 --> 01:34:52.108
It was because we shared
the same mustang spirit.

1458
01:34:55.695 --> 01:34:56.780
[George] I'm so proud of you.

1459
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:02.660
-[Black Beauty whinnies]
-[Jo chuckles]

1460
01:35:03.495 --> 01:35:05.997
We've been looking for you
for a long time. Beauty.

1461
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:08.708
Don't worry.
Your friends are coming with us.

1462
01:35:16.508 --> 01:35:17.926
Adiós. hermosa.

1463
01:35:24.599 --> 01:35:25.725
Let's go home.

1464
01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:32.399
[Black Beauty]
I could smell the salt on the air again.

1465
01:35:33.983 --> 01:35:36.653
I was going home at last.

1466
01:35:36.736 --> 01:35:37.946
[horses whinnying]

1467
01:35:40.615 --> 01:35:42.200
[Black Beauty] Jo had done it.

1468
01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:52.627
I had never seen
such a funny little horse...

1469
01:35:52.711 --> 01:35:54.337
[pony nickers]

1470
01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:58.675
[Black Beauty] ...except for Merrylegs.
And he had a family.

1471
01:35:58.758 --> 01:36:01.720
Remember your old friend?
I found him while I was looking for you.

1472
01:36:10.437 --> 01:36:12.063
[nickers]

1473
01:36:12.689 --> 01:36:13.690
You're home.

1474
01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:18.570
Anna...

1475
01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.032
this... is Beauty.

1476
01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:25.702
Would you like to say hello?

1477
01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:28.455
Hello.

1478
01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.543
Would you like to touch her nose?

1479
01:36:34.544 --> 01:36:35.795
It's very soft.

1480
01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:39.007
-She'll bite me.
-[Jo] She will not.

1481
01:36:40.258 --> 01:36:41.551
We taught each other well...

1482
01:36:43.136 --> 01:36:44.471
a long time ago.

1483
01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:54.731
I thought you said she was wild.

1484
01:36:55.357 --> 01:36:58.693
She was... once.

1485
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.739
As wild as wild can be.

1486
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.575
She saved my life. you know.

1487
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.245
How could a horse save a person?

1488
01:37:11.623 --> 01:37:13.291
I'd love to tell you.

1489
01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.880
So. when I was growing up.

1490
01:37:18.963 --> 01:37:22.592
something happened
that changed my life... forever.

1491
01:37:23.468 --> 01:37:26.054
And Beauty's actually why
I started this place.

1492
01:37:26.846 --> 01:37:30.850
[Black Beauty]
I was so proud of who she had become.

1493
01:37:36.564 --> 01:37:39.984
Give him a good pat.
And tell him. "Thank you."

1494
01:37:41.611 --> 01:37:42.737
[Anna] Thank you.

1495
01:37:43.363 --> 01:37:45.198
Always remember to say thank you.

1496
01:37:51.955 --> 01:37:55.000
[gate creaks]

1497
01:37:58.878 --> 01:38:00.463
Welcome home. Beauty.

1498
01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:04.050
[Black Beauty] Home.

1499
01:38:06.803 --> 01:38:10.223
I was finally back
where I was meant to be.

1500
01:38:10.306 --> 01:38:12.308
[Black Beauty whinnies]

1501
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:49.929
[Black Beauty]
A wise horse once told me...

1502
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:54.934
a mustang's spirit can never be broken.

1503
01:38:56.394 --> 01:38:58.772
That it has the strength of the ocean...

1504
01:38:59.856 --> 01:39:03.026
and lives forever. like the wind.

1505
01:39:05.737 --> 01:39:09.491
It took me a long time to realize
why that was true.

1506
01:39:10.158 --> 01:39:13.870
but now I know it is
because a true mustang

1507
01:39:13.953 --> 01:39:18.124
never gives up on hope... or on love.

1508
01:39:23.213 --> 01:39:25.965
And as my final moments found me

1509
01:39:26.049 --> 01:39:29.052
and I galloped toward the sky...

1510
01:39:30.845 --> 01:39:34.099
I realized my mother was right.

1511
01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:39.229
It really did feel like flying.
