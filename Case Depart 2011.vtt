What's up. guys?

5
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.624
How's it hanging?

6
00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.083

7
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.958
- You're back?
- I got out a week ago.

8
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.499
It wasn't too bad?

9
00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.083
I kept busy:
lots of reading. pumping iron...

10
00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:23.999
How long were you in for?

11
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.124
3 months.
I Not too bad for a hold-up.

12
00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:28.541
For a lady's bag?

13
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.416
During the hold-up.

14
00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:37.083
Anyway. i'm through with it.

15
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.874

I'm so happy.

18
00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.041
Find a job.
It's the best way to reintegrate.

19
00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.291
No-one'll take me with my face.

20
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.208
I won't work for whitie.
Slavery's oνer!

21
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:56.249
Don't say that.
I work for a building firm.

22
00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.624
They hire young people.
You'd be welcome there.

23
00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:00.958
I'm real busy.

24
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.499
I gotta get my kid from school.

25
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.083
And stuff...

26
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:06.874
Praise to God.

27
00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.791
Well. it's good to see you.

28
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.083
Come to the mosque.

29
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.499
God willing. I'll come on Friday.

30
00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:20.874
Fuck me. what an ass!
I'd nail that bitch anytime!

31
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.916
Peace. brother.

32
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.499
My husband's in Cameroon.

33
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.333
We haven't heard from him.

34
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.874
I'm here with the kids.
I can't pay the rent.

35
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:47.166
Does he work?

36
00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.374
He was a security guard.

37
00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.208
You don't work?

38
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.666
I clean at the hospital.

39
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.249
- How many children?
- 5.

40
00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.124
With him or in all?

41
00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:07.291
Excuse me. Régis.
Let me show you the election poster.

42
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.291
I love it.

43
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.083
Who's that?

44
00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.708
My gardener. I thought
it'd look more ethnically diverse.

45
00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:21.333
I can't say his name.

46
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.291
Me and my wife call him Peanut!

47
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.374
Not bad. huh?
Parity. diνersity...

48
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.124
You just need a gay!

49
00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:34.333
Do you know any?

50
00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.374
I'm joking!

51
00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:44.083
More cars were set fire to
in Les Lys.

52
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.208
Delinquents rule the place.

53
00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:47.791
I'd raid the place.

54
00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.624
Send 'em home
if they won't be French.

55
00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:54.416
Τhis lady liνes in Les Lys.

56
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:55.874
Oh. yes!

57
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.374
Hello. ma'am.

58
00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:00.749
lt's such a liνely.
colorful neighborhood.

59
00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:04.166
I loνe smelling all those spices
on the landing!

60
00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:06.958
You're in good hands.

61
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.041
Régis will find you a place.

62
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.499
Huh. Régis?

63
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.416
I'll leaνe you to it.

64
00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:16.499
The Mayor!

65
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.708
Where were we?
Mrs Mouloumbi...

66
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.499
Husband in Cameroon.

67
00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.541
Why didn't you go with him?

68
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.666
The kids were born here.
They're French.

69
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.624
It's always the same.
You're from Africa...

70
00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.416
I'm from Normandy.
I was born here.

71
00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:36.374
I need proof
that you're a single parent.

72
00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.374
If I get evicted.

73
00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.249
we'll be on the street.

74
00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:42.583
Go live with your husband.

75
00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:44.958
It's warmer there.

76
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.583
I picked up my kid.
I forgot my wallet.

77
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.999
You have no ticket.
It's 40 euros...

78
00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.458
It's 'cause i'm black?

79
00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.291
We check everyone.

80
00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.958
Sure!

81
00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:00.333
Got 40 euros. honey?

82
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.458
ID. please. sir.

83
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.791
Just wait.

84
00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:07.624
Does your friend have it?

85
00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.666
No. just my lunch money.

86
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.083
Can I have it?

87
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.208
I'll pay you back.
Don't bust my balls!

88
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:31.541
Racists!

89
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:35.458
I grew up in the war. sir.
I saw real racism.

90
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:37.458
Shut up. bitch.
I'm a Muslim!

91
00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:38.666
Enough!

92
00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:40.791
I'm black. too.

93
00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.208
Enough!
You're a discredit to us.

94
00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.083
- Hey. brother...
- Don't "brother" me.

95
00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:47.708
In front of your daughter!

96
00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:49.041
Cousin...?

97
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.249
Uncle...?

98
00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:03.958
Dirty traitor! You coconut!

99
00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:13.583
Shit!

100
00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:15.249
Βeat it!

101
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.583
I No money! No wash windshield!
Scram!

102
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.624
Calm down. Régis.

103
00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:22.249
Scram. dammit!

104
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.874
Filthy beggar!

105
00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.416
- He's handicapped!
- No way. it's just a mafia!

106
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.749
Τhey just want our pity.

107
00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:32.208
- Dad's talking nonsense.
- Really?

108
00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:12.541
Sometimes they cut off an arm
to earn more.

109
00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:18.124
Albanians...

110
00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.208
Just out of jail.
you cause trouble.

111
00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:35.499
- I had no money.
- Quiet. son!

112
00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:37.833
You stole off
your daughter's friend!

113
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.124
I'll repay her.

114
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.291
I Nonsense! When? And how?

115
00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.499
I swear on the Koran.
i'll repay her.

116
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:47.833
Shut your mouth!
None of that here!

117
00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:48.958
You hear?

118
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.208
You're not fit to be a son of mine!

119
00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:54.874
You stole from ladies.
now from kids!

120
00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:56.041
You grass!

121
00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:59.124
She's not a grass.
She loves you.

122
00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:02.916
Her friend's mom rang to say
you stole off her kid!

123
00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:06.083
Whitie's a grass
right from primary school!

124
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.624
Shut your mouth! Be quiet!

125
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.291
None of that here.

126
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.708
Prison didn't improve you.

127
00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.041
What did you learn inside?

128
00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:16.999
I curse my womb!

129
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.083
What did I do to the Lord?

130
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.041
What did I do. God?

131
00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.666
I'll kill you one day.

132
00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:29.624
Τake your things
and leave my house.

133
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.916
Come back with a job

134
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:34.541
and money to raise your daughter.

135
00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:37.749
Look at me!

136
00:08:47.584 --> 00:08:48.333
For you.

137
00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:55.916
Who was it?

138
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.416
My uncle. my father's brother.

139
00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:03.333
I thought
you had no contact with them.

140
00:09:05.084 --> 00:09:06.249
What did he want?

141
00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:10.208
To tell me my father's dying.

142
00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:12.041
Pass me the cheese.

143
00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:14.083
Your father?

144
00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:18.874
You said he died decades ago.

145
00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.583
He was never there for me.

146
00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:26.666
I was 8 when I last saw him.
He's dead to me.

147
00:09:29.417 --> 00:09:32.124
You tell me
after 10 years together.

148
00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:35.666
So. what'll you do?

149
00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:37.458
What'll I do?

150
00:09:38.084 --> 00:09:41.291
Some stranger's funeral
in the West lndies!

151
00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:43.249
It's your Dad's funeral!

152
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.374
I can't go. I'm not vaccinated.

153
00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:48.333
You are going.

154
00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:52.874
If not. I'll go and get laid
by big crack-dealing blacks!

155
00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:55.499
Enough. Corinne!

156
00:09:56.084 --> 00:09:56.916
No. it's not!

157
00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:00.916
You think it over.
I can't take any more!

158
00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:03.624
I don't recognize you anymore!

159
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:11.749
Dad. what are big
crack-dealing blacks?

160
00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:13.749
I Nothing. honey.

161
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.458
Finish the Camembert.

162
00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:39.624
Look out. sonovabitch!

163
00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:44.916
Régis?

164
00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:46.333
Joël!

165
00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:49.541
Hey. bro!

166
00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.499
Visiting Dad?

167
00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:01.666
It's been 20 years.

168
00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:02.958
Yeah!

169
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:06.041
- I'll help you.
- I No. it's OK!

170
00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.166
I'll get a taxi.

171
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.874
- How are things?
- Just great.

172
00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:24.458
A 9-year-old girl.
a wonderful wife.

173
00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:27.458
I set up my own firm.

174
00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.874
I work for the town hall.

175
00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:33.249
I just bought a riverside house.
And you?

176
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.999
Same. Exactly the same.

177
00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:38.249
9-year-old girl...

178
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.166
- Where do you live?
- Same!

179
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.208
I bought a house.

180
00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:49.583
Paris. By the Seine.

181
00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:51.333
Wow!

182
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.874
Τhat can't be cheap.

183
00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.208
- What do you do?
- Me?

184
00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:00.833
I set up a firm.

185
00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:04.083
Helping old people.

186
00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:07.874
Τransport...

187
00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:10.208
Home help.

188
00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:12.291
Here to see your family?

189
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.041
What did he say?

190
00:12:18.917 --> 00:12:20.666
It's a local thing!

191
00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:34.791
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah. right.

192
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.458
Shit!

193
00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:40.124
I should've claimed it on expenses.

194
00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.333
Régis. Joël...

195
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.374
I'm your Uncle Jocelyn.

196
00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:48.791
I'm the one who phoned you.
Come on.

197
00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:53.416
You're just in time.

198
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:55.999
He's near the end.

199
00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:12.166
Who are the chicks?

200
00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.041
Your half-sisters.

201
00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:16.458
Your Dad traveled a lot.

202
00:13:19.084 --> 00:13:20.541
Say hello to your aunt.

203
00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.499
Arlette!

204
00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:28.416
Josiane!

205
00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:30.041
Oh. Lord!

206
00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:32.124
I Not again.

207
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:33.249
Delphine!

208
00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.499
Joséphine!

209
00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:37.541
What's that?

210
00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:39.166
He's reliving his life.

211
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:40.499
Gladys!

212
00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:42.874
Muriel!

213
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.791
Bernard!

214
00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:52.458
Régis!

215
00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:53.541
Joël!

216
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.708
My sons...

217
00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:02.958
You're here.

218
00:14:08.917 --> 00:14:09.791
Τhank you.

219
00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:13.249
You're my only two boys.

220
00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:16.624
I know.
I wasn't always there for you.

221
00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:18.166
I Never. actually.

222
00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:20.708
I was a bad dad.

223
00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:22.499
Like me.

224
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:26.083
you bear the name. Bigdesire.

225
00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:29.416
And your children. too.

226
00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:34.458
Although I made mistakes in my life.

227
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.708
tonight.

228
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.708
I want to give you...

229
00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:44.041
What. Dad?

230
00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:46.666
Lucienne!

231
00:14:50.917 --> 00:14:53.833
I want to give you

232
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.083
the Bigdesire treasure!

233
00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.541
A treasure?

234
00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:04.166
No. Dad. don't go yet!

235
00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.374
Bring him water!

236
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:08.791
What treasure?!

237
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.166
What treasure?

238
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.499
Fatoumata!

239
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.833
A paper!

240
00:15:28.292 --> 00:15:29.999
It's not just any paper.

241
00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:33.208
It's your slave ancestors'
bill of freedom.

242
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:37.874
Τhanks to that. your forefathers
could travel freely.

243
00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.749
Go smoke that elsewhere.

244
00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:41.666
Keep it safe.

245
00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:44.749
Your father got it from his father.

246
00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:48.708
You'll give it to your kids
who'll give it to theirs.

247
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.999
So. our family never forgets
our ancestors' suffering.

248
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.541
I'm going back to him.

249
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.083
Good!

250
00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.124
No inheritance. no lawyer.

251
00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:08.999
I'll get back home sooner.

252
00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:10.458
Wait!

253
00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:14.749
We could sell it to a museum
and make some cash.

254
00:16:14.917 --> 00:16:17.166
They'd have sold it long ago.

255
00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:19.499
We must respect his wishes.

256
00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:22.791
Your half.

257
00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:32.249
Don't forget our sisters!

258
00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:28.833
Where are we?

259
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:36.291
lt wasn't me. Mom!

260
00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:38.041
Why are we here?

261
00:17:40.917 --> 00:17:43.041
That grass sure was strong!

262
00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:47.249
We've had a big trip!

263
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.583
Τhat's where your crap got us!

264
00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:53.583
Your smoke must've intoxicated me.

265
00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.833
Maybe we were raped.

266
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.833
I No network.

267
00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:09.958
What a shitty country!

268
00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:32.416
- Run!
- Why?

269
00:18:32.584 --> 00:18:34.916
If a black sees a black run.
he runs!

270
00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:35.999
I'm innocent.

271
00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:38.624
Whatever. I'm running!

272
00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:52.166
Over there!
2 blacks with a radio...

273
00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:04.958
- They're insane.
- Shut up!

274
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.166
They must be cops!

275
00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:10.416
- Really?
- Of course!

276
00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:13.124
They're dressed up as tramps.

277
00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:21.708
You'll ruin my career!

278
00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:24.708
I want to put it on the net

279
00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:27.499
so everyone sees
how cops treats blacks.

280
00:19:31.334 --> 00:19:32.583
Officer!

281
00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:38.916
I haven't done a thing.
He smoked the drugs...

282
00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:40.208
Shut up. negroes!

283
00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:41.916
Screw you. sonova...

284
00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:46.958
Amnesty International
will hear about this.

285
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.166
Shut up!

286
00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:49.874
I'll cut out your tongues!

287
00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:56.874
- Where to?
- The market.

288
00:19:57.084 --> 00:19:58.708
We'll get a few coins.

289
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.833
Cut off their feet!

290
00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:03.624
We're selling 'em. idiot!

291
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:06.541
Sell who?

292
00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:11.958
Step right up!
Here are some top-quality negroes.

293
00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:15.624
freshly captured on Africa's coasts.

294
00:20:15.792 --> 00:20:20.541
Don't miss this exceptional
consignment of ebony.

295
00:20:20.709 --> 00:20:22.374
Τhey're in perfect condition

296
00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:26.749
and will increase
your plantation's profits in no time.

297
00:20:26.917 --> 00:20:29.999
Step right up. folks.
Don't be scared.

298
00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:32.166
Touch the merchandise.

299
00:20:32.334 --> 00:20:35.791
Feel how young. handsome
and strong they are.

300
00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:38.124

00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:40.458
They're young. handsome...

Taste my wares!

303
00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:48.916
The idiots!

304
00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:51.624
Is it Candid Camera?

305
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:03.291
This one's a bit fat.

306
00:21:05.584 --> 00:21:07.624
What're you doing. you faggot?

307
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.374
He touched my balls!

308
00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:18.499
His back teeth are in bad condition.
His breath stinks.

309
00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:21.749
- I didn't have time to brush...
- Shut up!

310
00:21:22.584 --> 00:21:25.499
Gentlemen. there are only 2 left.

311
00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:28.083
A mulatto for the home
and an athlete

312
00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:32.041
for... endurance work.

313
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:36.041
Come now. make an effort.

314
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.166
I'll do these 2 negroes

315
00:21:41.584 --> 00:21:42.999
for the price of 1 .

316
00:21:44.209 --> 00:21:46.749
It's a gift. not an investment!

317
00:21:48.084 --> 00:21:49.166
Gentlemen.

318
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:50.958
I know times are hard...

319
00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.583
I don't want to have to shoot 'em.

320
00:21:55.084 --> 00:21:56.041
2 negroes

321
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.874

Mr Henri. 2 new ones.

330
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:14.791
Forgive me. sir.
they look second-rate.

331
00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:17.083
Τhey didn't cost much.

332
00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:18.791
Right...

333
00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:23.624
Take this one to the fields
so he can start work.

334
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:26.708
I'll take the mulatto
to the kitchens.

335
00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:34.291
Get these savages' outfits off them.

336
00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:40.208
Sir. there's a misunderstanding.
I work at the town h...

337
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.833
Don't speak
till a white allows you to.

338
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.749
Look down.

339
00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:54.499
- With your big cock...
- Pardon me?

340
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.041
What did I say? Look down.

341
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.333
What're you looking at?

342
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.874
Are you looking at my dick?

343
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:10.833
You said to look down.

344
00:24:11.084 --> 00:24:12.374
Enough. Mr Henri.

345
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.874
Τhey need names.

346
00:24:16.334 --> 00:24:18.833
You'll be Gaspard.

347
00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:23.374
As for you. it'll be... Gédéon.

348
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.583
Follow me. Gédéon.

349
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.833
- C'mon.
- What?

350
00:24:30.209 --> 00:24:31.249
You're Gédéon.

351
00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:32.791
No. I'm Gaspard.

352
00:24:32.959 --> 00:24:34.083
No. he said...

353
00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:36.583
Don't make a fool of me!

354
00:24:37.125 --> 00:24:37.916

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.083
- I Name?
- Gédéon!

361
00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:57.583
That's good.

362
00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:00.249
You'll make a good slave.

363
00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:01.416
Your big cock...

364
00:25:13.917 --> 00:25:16.041
Βravo. bravo!

365
00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:20.541
I raise my glass to our children

366
00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:22.708
and their future nuptials.

367
00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:25.083
Τo your daughter. father-in-law.

368
00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:29.458
- Isn't he handsome. Mother?
- He's exquisite.

369
00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:31.833
Victor. help your sister.

370
00:25:32.042 --> 00:25:33.208
Yes. father.

371
00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:40.749
Move!

372
00:25:41.417 --> 00:25:42.458
OK!

373
00:25:43.417 --> 00:25:45.749
- Isidore...
- Yes. Mr Henri.

374
00:25:47.459 --> 00:25:49.999
Look after the new boy.
His name's Gédéon.

375
00:25:50.209 --> 00:25:51.499
Yes. Mr Henri.

376
00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:53.749
Right away.

377
00:25:54.792 --> 00:25:56.291
Have a good day. Mr Henri.

378
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:04.874
Follow me.

379
00:26:07.709 --> 00:26:08.958
Are you deaf?

380
00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:14.791
Don't be a stubborn negro.

381
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.124
You're lucky to be here.

382
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:20.708
So. behave or you'll end up
working in the fields.

383
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:21.791
Where are we?

384
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.374
Are you stupid?

385
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:25.124
Mr Jourdain's house.

386
00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:30.166
It's over all that!
No more slaves and masters!

387
00:26:30.334 --> 00:26:31.291
I'm a citizen

388
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.833
of the French Republic!

389
00:26:33.042 --> 00:26:35.041
I married a white girl!

390
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:39.624
Don't say such lies.
If the Master hears you...

391
00:26:47.959 --> 00:26:49.208
Move it. negro.

392
00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:51.333
- I can't...
- Move!

393
00:26:57.834 --> 00:26:59.249
It's my ligament!

394
00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:01.333
It's an old injury.

395
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.958
In '98.

396
00:27:03.167 --> 00:27:04.499
in a soccer match!

397
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.499
Regional finals!

398
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.583
It's better. much better!

399
00:27:10.792 --> 00:27:13.374
To work. filthy negro.
with your big...!

400
00:27:13.584 --> 00:27:14.708
Racist!

401
00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:17.124
What?

402
00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:18.666
lt's 'cause l'm black.

403
00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:21.624
Well. obviously!

404
00:27:38.542 --> 00:27:39.499
Father.

405
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.374
may I take the leftovers
to our slaves?

406
00:27:42.584 --> 00:27:46.249
Victor. I don't like to see you
hanging around the fields.

407
00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:47.458
And you know

408
00:27:47.667 --> 00:27:50.166
that their diet is different to ours.

409
00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:52.124
That's right. Mr Victor.

410
00:27:52.292 --> 00:27:54.791
Τhese delicacies are too refined.

411
00:27:55.417 --> 00:27:58.874
They need food
as simple as they are.

412
00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:01.249
Be careful.
if you get too close.

413
00:28:01.459 --> 00:28:03.291
they might eat you!

414
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.791
Are African negroes
really cannibals?

415
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.124
Of course.

416
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.916
If you're lost in the jungle.

417
00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:17.666
it's hard to escape.

418
00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:19.416
Their wide noses

419
00:28:19.792 --> 00:28:22.291
give them a better sense of smell.

420
00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:25.791
They can smell us
several leagues away.

421
00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:27.083
Shouldn't they start

422
00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:28.791
by smelling themselves?

423
00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:32.708
How witty!

424
00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:59.749
I'd rather suck sugar cane
than eat their gruel.

425
00:29:00.292 --> 00:29:01.499
l'm exhausted.

426
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:22.374
Βack to work!

427
00:29:31.834 --> 00:29:34.291
Some whites get negresses pregnant.

428
00:29:35.834 --> 00:29:38.458
Are these half-breeds even men?

429
00:29:39.167 --> 00:29:43.333
A horse that fornicates with a donkey
breeds a mule. not a horse.

430
00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:45.708
A mule's stupid and sterile.

431
00:29:47.709 --> 00:29:50.499
And what about their gigantic sex?

432
00:29:58.917 --> 00:30:01.083
Some travelers I came across

433
00:30:01.292 --> 00:30:03.124
in pygmy country

434
00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:06.708
say that they use it
to cling onto branches.

435
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:07.916
like possums.

436
00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:09.083
Really?

437
00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:11.208
When were you in Africa?

438
00:30:13.084 --> 00:30:16.958
I bivouacked in the dark continent
in my youth.

439
00:30:17.334 --> 00:30:18.624
I came back 20 years ago.

440
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.499
In 1760.

441
00:30:23.042 --> 00:30:24.291
My dress! Τhe idiot!

442
00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:26.708
Sorry. I'll put salt on it.

443
00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:30.124
I None of your voodoo!

444
00:30:30.292 --> 00:30:31.333
Come now.

445
00:30:31.959 --> 00:30:33.874
Βe fair. he just got here.

446
00:30:34.209 --> 00:30:36.249
My fashion dress ruined!

447
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:39.541
Τhese negroes have feet for hands!

448
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.041
And hands for feet.
Like all apes.

449
00:30:47.459 --> 00:30:48.874
I don't believe it!

450
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.624
1780!

451
00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:02.416
How did we get to the Middle Ages?

452
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.083
Renaissance?

453
00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:09.166
What happened?

454
00:31:12.084 --> 00:31:12.749
I know!

455
00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:16.291
1780 - Louis XVI!

456
00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:18.583
I don't need a history lesson!

457
00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:23.374
I'm off.

458
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:25.624
Where to?

459
00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:27.374
I'm outta here.

460
00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:30.916
I won't work all day
and get beaten. too.

461
00:31:31.084 --> 00:31:33.124
The idea of a job
was bad enough.

462
00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:35.874
Got any friends in 1780?

463
00:31:36.167 --> 00:31:37.499
Don't worry about me.

464
00:31:37.667 --> 00:31:39.833
Men with dogs will come after you.

465
00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:43.291
I'll be long gone
before they realize.

466
00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:44.874
Call me Houdini!

467
00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:46.708
You coming or not?

468
00:31:46.917 --> 00:31:48.499
We have to stay together.

469
00:31:49.167 --> 00:31:50.708
Are you coming?

470
00:31:56.792 --> 00:31:57.833
Loser!

471
00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:00.916
Stay here. You're just a slave.

472
00:32:01.084 --> 00:32:02.374
I'm a real man.

473
00:32:02.542 --> 00:32:04.208
I Not a wage slave!

474
00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:36.166
Come in.

475
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.249
Open the window.
Τhe smell of negro

476
00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:47.749
is unbearable!

477
00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.041
It's Mr Henri.

478
00:32:52.334 --> 00:32:53.666
Good evening.

479
00:32:54.042 --> 00:32:55.833
My sinuses are fragile.

480
00:32:56.292 --> 00:32:58.249
Contact with the negroes

481
00:32:58.459 --> 00:33:00.999
must have spiced up your odor
somewhat.

482
00:33:01.209 --> 00:33:04.333
Don't worry.
his nose isn't flattened yet!

483
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.916
Βehave yourselves. please!

484
00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:15.458
We're lucky
that there are still men like him

485
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.708
who can control the negroes.

486
00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:23.249
What brings you?

487
00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:26.083
Just to say
that the day went well.

488
00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:27.874
Perhaps we should

489
00:33:28.084 --> 00:33:30.041
chain up Gédéon.

490
00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:31.833
He's quite savage.

491
00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:34.374
Give him time to settle in.

492
00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:36.833
I know
you'll lick him into shape.

493
00:33:37.042 --> 00:33:39.374
Have a rest and a good bath.

494
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:42.416
Goodnight. sir.

495
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.291
Ladies.

496
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:48.249
Don't go sleep in a hut
by mistake!

497
00:33:56.584 --> 00:33:57.749
What the hell's that?

498
00:33:58.959 --> 00:34:00.916
Stay behind me
if you're scared.

499
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.249
Am I my brother's keeper?

500
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:07.874
When I was a boy scout.
I was the best at orienteering.

501
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.208
So. don't give me that crap.

502
00:34:11.584 --> 00:34:13.958
- You were a boy scout?
- You bet.

503
00:34:20.084 --> 00:34:21.124
Gotcha!

504
00:34:22.209 --> 00:34:24.874
- You're such a kid!
- I got ya. admit it!

505
00:34:31.292 --> 00:34:32.416
Very funny!

506
00:34:32.584 --> 00:34:34.458
It doesn't work the second time.

507
00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:40.249
Fuck. fuck!

508
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.374
Well. goodnight.

509
00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:45.208
'Night.

510
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.666
Get up!

511
00:34:56.959 --> 00:34:58.208
Get up. in there!

512
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.666
Get up. lazybones!

513
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.499
Shut up! We're sleeping!

514
00:35:09.792 --> 00:35:12.208
- I forgot!
- It wasn't me!

515
00:35:16.167 --> 00:35:20.374
In the beginning was God.
and God was the beginning.

516
00:35:20.959 --> 00:35:23.708
All that comes
from the earth and the sky

517
00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:26.041
comes from God

518
00:35:26.209 --> 00:35:30.124
and comes
from the Almighty's divine word.

519
00:35:30.417 --> 00:35:31.249
Amen.

520
00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:33.916
Kiss-ass!

521
00:35:34.459 --> 00:35:36.041
We need His help now.

522
00:35:39.042 --> 00:35:40.249
This sacred word

523
00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:42.499
must always be obeyed.

524
00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:46.999
All things were done by His word

525
00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:49.458
and nothing was done

526
00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:51.541
without His word.

527
00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:53.499
It is life.

528
00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:56.166
And life is the light of man.

529
00:35:56.584 --> 00:35:57.458
Amen.

530
00:35:59.209 --> 00:36:01.249
Creep. have you no pride?

531
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:03.833
Is there a problem?

532
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.958
Allah is great!

533
00:36:17.417 --> 00:36:18.583
"Τhe light

534
00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:21.333
shines in the darkness.

535
00:36:22.584 --> 00:36:25.291
and the darkness
has not overcome it."

536
00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:32.208
You who live in the darkness.

537
00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:35.208
who are the same color.

538
00:36:35.417 --> 00:36:37.291
be good workers.

539
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.624
tireless and submissive.

540
00:36:40.959 --> 00:36:42.624
And then...

541
00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:44.666
perhaps

542
00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:47.708
you too may be...

543
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:50.166
touched by the light.

544
00:36:57.042 --> 00:36:58.291
Father...

545
00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:00.791
God created man in His image.

546
00:37:01.084 --> 00:37:03.708
Why not live all together equally?

547
00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:09.124
Because it says so here.

548
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.291
Blacks obey whites.

549
00:37:16.417 --> 00:37:19.749
No. it says: "Jesus went to eat
with the Pharisees."

550
00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:24.624
Well...

551
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.124
God loves you all.
Get to work.

552
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.291
Heard him?

553
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.874
Get to work!

554
00:37:36.042 --> 00:37:38.041
Well. Isaac. what news?

555
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.541
Nothing interesting. sir.

556
00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:42.166
Τhe sugar cane crisis

557
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:44.874
is still on everyone's lips.

558
00:37:45.417 --> 00:37:47.583
Did you get everything I asked for?

559
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.291
I think so. sir.

560
00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:53.833
Perfume for your daughter and
barrels of good wine for the wedding.

561
00:37:54.292 --> 00:37:56.166
You forgot the fabric?

562
00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.874
My wife is making my life
hell about it.

563
00:38:00.042 --> 00:38:01.458
It slipped my mind.

564
00:38:01.834 --> 00:38:02.708
Isaac!

565
00:38:02.875 --> 00:38:06.166
Don't worry. I'll be back in 2 days.

566
00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:09.916
For the wine and the perfume.
you own me 50 crowns.

567
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.416
Really...?

568
00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:17.833
- Don't forget my fabric.
- I won't.

569
00:38:21.084 --> 00:38:22.166
Goodbye. Isaac.

570
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.666
50 crowns!

571
00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:28.083
Dirty Jew!

572
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.041
See you in 2 days. sir.

573
00:38:33.042 --> 00:38:34.249
What an asshole!

574
00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:42.041
Where were you?

575
00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:45.458
Washing. I'm only 2 minutes late.

576
00:38:48.709 --> 00:38:49.999
Who d'you think you are?

577
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:53.416
Give me a knife.
I'll cut your damn field.

578
00:38:53.584 --> 00:38:54.374
Bro...

579
00:38:54.792 --> 00:38:56.208
I've had enough of this!

580
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.541
Sorry. sir.

581
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.999
He's a bad negro.

582
00:38:59.542 --> 00:39:00.958
Βad African habits...

583
00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:02.124
Screw you!

584
00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.958
I'll teach you some manners.

585
00:39:08.792 --> 00:39:09.916
With your big cock...

586
00:39:45.709 --> 00:39:47.958
I've always been a good master.

587
00:39:48.584 --> 00:39:51.374
But I won't tolerate
on this plantation

588
00:39:51.542 --> 00:39:53.416
slaves who disrespect a white.

589
00:39:54.334 --> 00:39:56.291
Let this be a lesson to you all.

590
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.791
Mr Henri...

591
00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:09.208
How's the wedding coming along?

592
00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:13.624
It should be a great success.
my dear girl.

593
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:17.999
We have wine from France
and musicians.

594
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:21.124
I can't wait.

595
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:22.624
Liberty!

596
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:28.416
Equality!

597
00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:33.749
Motherfucker!

598
00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:38.083
Isidore. Rosalie. untie him.

599
00:40:48.542 --> 00:40:51.083
Liberty. equality... fraternity.

600
00:40:52.709 --> 00:40:53.708
Fraternity!

601
00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:04.541
Come in. don't be scared.

602
00:41:08.917 --> 00:41:09.916
Are you hungry?

603
00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:11.041
Thirsty?

604
00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:13.208
I No. thank you.

605
00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:14.458
You look better.

606
00:41:14.917 --> 00:41:17.583
How's your second day
at the plantation?

607
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.499
Good.

608
00:41:22.459 --> 00:41:24.124
So. you can read?

609
00:41:25.167 --> 00:41:26.374
Yes. indeed.

610
00:41:27.709 --> 00:41:28.458
Here.

611
00:41:29.584 --> 00:41:30.291
Read that.

612
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.374
"The Black Code.

613
00:41:38.667 --> 00:41:39.958
Article 3.

614
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.291
Forbid public displays of religions

615
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.583
other than Roman Catholicism."

616
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.041
You know.

617
00:41:47.209 --> 00:41:50.041
except for our religion.

618
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.499
teaching slaves is frowned upon.

619
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.999
I can only read a few words.

620
00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:56.333
Don't bother.

621
00:41:56.709 --> 00:41:57.791
He told me.

622
00:41:58.292 --> 00:41:59.958
Others can read.

623
00:42:00.334 --> 00:42:01.833
Gédéon can. too...

624
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:03.624
I think...

625
00:42:03.834 --> 00:42:04.874
Don't be scared.

626
00:42:05.167 --> 00:42:07.541
An educated negro is very rare.

627
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.916
Not all whites can read.

628
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:17.374
You're a smarter negro
than the others.

629
00:42:17.584 --> 00:42:19.999
Your white side makes you cleverer.

630
00:42:21.084 --> 00:42:21.916
Τhank you.

631
00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:24.791
Would you like to command slaves?

632
00:42:26.125 --> 00:42:27.124
I don't know...

633
00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:29.208
Sleep in the barn?

634
00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:32.208
With good straw?

635
00:42:37.375 --> 00:42:38.749
Does it sting?

636
00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:40.249
I No. it's OK.

637
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.208
Strange...

638
00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:48.666
Usually. African slaves
are more robust than you.

639
00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:51.333
Meaning?

640
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:55.208
You seem a bit clueless.

641
00:42:57.125 --> 00:43:00.708
You didn't work on the land much
in your country.

642
00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:04.416
You must come from a rich family.

643
00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:07.124
Me? That's a good one!

644
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:09.666
Be careful!

645
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.874
Your skin is soft.

646
00:43:18.125 --> 00:43:20.708
And your hands aren't damaged
like ours.

647
00:43:24.709 --> 00:43:25.916
What're you doing?

648
00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:27.749
What?

649
00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:31.166
You're here. I'm here.
we go well together.

650
00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.999
- Any significant other?
- What?

651
00:43:34.167 --> 00:43:35.333
Are you with a guy?

652
00:43:36.334 --> 00:43:37.166
I No.

653
00:43:38.125 --> 00:43:39.291
You must be.

654
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:43.583
I like Isidore.

655
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:50.833
I know a man like him
wouldn't want a woman like me.

656
00:43:51.584 --> 00:43:53.166
He knows so much.

657
00:43:53.667 --> 00:43:55.166
He speaks well.

658
00:43:55.792 --> 00:43:57.416
He's strong. intelligent...

659
00:43:57.584 --> 00:43:59.291
OK. OK. I get it!

660
00:43:59.875 --> 00:44:01.291
Don't be like that.

661
00:44:03.459 --> 00:44:05.624
How do you get a chick here?

662
00:44:09.084 --> 00:44:10.583
There are no movies...

663
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:14.249
I No hangouts.

664
00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:15.708
I don't understand.

665
00:44:15.917 --> 00:44:17.583
Get some rest. Gédéon.

666
00:44:21.334 --> 00:44:23.041
You should have him whipped.

667
00:44:24.584 --> 00:44:25.958
He humiliated me.

668
00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:29.541
- In front of the others.
- Calm down.

669
00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:31.999
I need someone to help Mr Henri.

670
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.541
Βeware. sir. An educated negro
is a dangerous negro.

671
00:44:37.834 --> 00:44:40.666
He might incite the others
to revolt.

672
00:44:41.375 --> 00:44:45.374
I saw it happen in
the rubber plantations in Τanganyika.

673
00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:47.166
Don't worry about that.

674
00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:50.874
I've made him totally inoffensive.

675
00:44:51.042 --> 00:44:54.624
What can a negro.
no matter how smart. hope for

676
00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.749
other than power over his kind?

677
00:44:56.959 --> 00:44:58.374
C'mon. get up!

678
00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:00.416
Get up!

679
00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:02.916
Get up. lazybones!

680
00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:10.041
Don't be an asshole!

681
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.333
I'm in charge.
Mr Jourdain said so.

682
00:45:14.542 --> 00:45:15.374
So. move!

683
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.958
Cut the crap! Let me sleep.

684
00:45:31.959 --> 00:45:33.083
Τhat's my piss bucket!

685
00:45:34.792 --> 00:45:36.083
These negroes!

686
00:45:43.792 --> 00:45:45.124
Hurry up!

687
00:45:46.542 --> 00:45:48.749
I'm to get the bridge repaired.

688
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:50.791
So. do it.

689
00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:56.166
- Can I have a word?
- Βe quick. we're busy.

690
00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:01.041
Are you serious?

691
00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:04.666
We don't belong here.

692
00:46:05.709 --> 00:46:09.249
I haven't forgotten.
But do you know how to get back?

693
00:46:10.792 --> 00:46:11.749
I No?

694
00:46:11.917 --> 00:46:14.166
So. avoid beatings
by impressing 'em.

695
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.624
Oh. yeah!

696
00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:21.583
So. licking whitie's ass

697
00:46:21.875 --> 00:46:23.374
is a strategy?

698
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:25.124
Of course!

699
00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:27.874
Well done. bro!

700
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.791
Get to work... Gédéon.

701
00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:42.958
Get to work. too!

702
00:46:43.959 --> 00:46:45.333
Don't look at me.

703
00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.499
Hi. partner!

704
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.041
Listen up. negro!

705
00:46:52.584 --> 00:46:54.374
And listen good!

706
00:46:55.584 --> 00:46:57.208
Size doesn't matter!

707
00:46:58.375 --> 00:47:00.333
Do you get me? Do you?

708
00:47:02.209 --> 00:47:03.833
Size doesn't matter.

709
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:11.499
Sky. cloudy.

710
00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.666


711
00:47:18.834 --> 00:47:21.999
I look at the sky
It's so cloudy

712
00:47:22.167 --> 00:47:26.166
That the day is rainy
Creates in me such ennui

713
00:47:27.334 --> 00:47:28.458
Βravo!

714
00:47:30.292 --> 00:47:31.166
Τhank you.

715
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:32.458
Βravo.

716
00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:39.083
I've come
to give you my report. sir.

717
00:47:39.792 --> 00:47:41.374
- Report?
- Yes.

718
00:47:41.542 --> 00:47:45.124
It went well. though I had
some trouble with Gédéon.

719
00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:47.708
You know negroes.
can't trust 'em.

720
00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:53.208
I fixed the bridge on my own.

721
00:47:54.375 --> 00:47:55.916
Well done. Gaspard.

722
00:47:56.292 --> 00:47:57.499
Τhanks. sir.

723
00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:01.416
Corn. morn.

724
00:48:02.042 --> 00:48:03.833
heart. impart.

725
00:48:08.209 --> 00:48:10.083
Τhe smell of sweet corn

726
00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:12.583
gladdens my heart...

727
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.416
Indeed.

728
00:48:23.459 --> 00:48:26.333
Corn in the morn
Imparts joy upon my heart!

729
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.166
How poetic! It's wonderful!

730
00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:30.666
It's the servant!

731
00:48:30.834 --> 00:48:33.083
I forgot to tell you.

732
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.583
Gaspard is a clever negro.
He can read.

733
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.583
He can read! Astonishing!

734
00:48:40.625 --> 00:48:42.458
Can he also play the piano?

735
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.583
The sun shines
Golden brown

736
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:23.791
The sun makes
Peoele the same color

737
00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:25.291
The same color

738
00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:27.749
O sweet sun

739
00:49:53.292 --> 00:49:55.083
Get up. lazybones!

740
00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:57.124
Come on!

741
00:50:05.459 --> 00:50:07.541
Get out of there. you two!

742
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.041
Seen Gaspard and Gédéon?

743
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.124
Get out! Out you come!

744
00:51:10.125 --> 00:51:11.916
How did you know?

745
00:51:12.084 --> 00:51:14.416
You snored all the way.

746
00:51:15.084 --> 00:51:18.458
I beg you.
don't take us back to the plantation!

747
00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:20.666
Are you thirsty?

748
00:51:30.209 --> 00:51:32.249
Bring them back unharmed.

749
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.291
I just bought them. I need them.

750
00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.124
Yes. sir.

751
00:51:43.584 --> 00:51:46.124
Unharmed! I know your methods.

752
00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:49.916
If they're incapacitated.
I won't pay you the rest.

753
00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:51.374
Don't worry. sir.

754
00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:54.999
You said that
last time a slave escaped.

755
00:51:56.959 --> 00:51:58.166
You cut off his feet.

756
00:52:01.042 --> 00:52:02.208
An accident. sir.

757
00:52:03.292 --> 00:52:04.458
Indeed.

758
00:52:05.584 --> 00:52:06.624
I bet it was.

759
00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:18.208
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?

760
00:52:18.667 --> 00:52:19.958
Βecause I'm Jewish.

761
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.166
Know what Christians call us?

762
00:52:24.542 --> 00:52:25.541
Europe's negroes.

763
00:52:26.334 --> 00:52:28.666
Our peoples have both suffered.

764
00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:30.208
Well. thank you.

765
00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:34.541
You suffered!
You do the same in Palestine!

766
00:52:35.792 --> 00:52:38.041
- What?
- He can't know that!

767
00:52:38.792 --> 00:52:39.958
Palestine?

768
00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:43.208
Forget it. We don't have time
for that old debate.

769
00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:50.416
We have to stick together. Two
peoples suffered throughout history.

770
00:52:50.792 --> 00:52:52.166
Jews. then blacks.

771
00:52:52.375 --> 00:52:53.958
Βlacks. then Jews!

772
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:56.916
No! We suffered more than you.

773
00:52:57.084 --> 00:52:59.833
Slavery's the biggest suffering!

774
00:53:00.042 --> 00:53:03.124
We suffered mass slavery in Egypt

775
00:53:03.292 --> 00:53:04.791
till Moses freed us.

776
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.999
Then. the lnquisition.
We suffered most!

777
00:53:08.417 --> 00:53:10.083
I can't let you say that.

778
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.583
- What?
- The debate's getting too heated.

779
00:53:14.167 --> 00:53:15.874
I think you're both right.

780
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.208
Τoday...

781
00:53:18.542 --> 00:53:21.124
I mean your today.
Ours is more complex.

782
00:53:22.084 --> 00:53:24.958
- I think blacks suffered more.
- Τhank you!

783
00:53:25.167 --> 00:53:26.374
I don't agree!

784
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:29.208
Later. with Adolf Hitler.
it's different.

785
00:53:29.417 --> 00:53:30.499
But that's...

786
00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:33.666
Who's this Adolf?

787
00:53:40.792 --> 00:53:43.249
A little guy with a mustache...

788
00:53:46.334 --> 00:53:48.749
With a side parting...

789
00:53:57.334 --> 00:54:00.166
The slave hunters!
Quick. go out the back way.

790
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.166
Τhanks. Isaac.
for not collaborating.

791
00:54:03.542 --> 00:54:04.374
Only natural.

792
00:54:05.042 --> 00:54:05.916
Βe careful...

793
00:54:10.709 --> 00:54:11.833
Adolf?

794
00:54:15.584 --> 00:54:17.874
C'mon. c'mon!

795
00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:49.749
C'mon!

796
00:55:10.667 --> 00:55:12.374
Screw you. faggots!

797
00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:17.749
Minimum wage earners!
Dunces!

798
00:55:19.459 --> 00:55:22.541
- Βitches!
- You flunked out of school!

799
00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:25.833
What are those crappy insults?

800
00:55:26.542 --> 00:55:27.874
They're insults.

801
00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:31.708
Did you flunk out. too?

802
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:37.208
Screw teachers!

803
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:39.166
Screw principals!

804
00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:41.041
Screw my school!

805
00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:43.249
Screw Mrs Duchêne!

806
00:55:43.417 --> 00:55:46.291
- Who's Mrs Duchêne?
- My French teacher.

807
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.583
Get down there!

808
00:56:08.709 --> 00:56:17.791
Hello.

809
00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:21.791
- I don't think that means "Hello".
- Really?

810
00:56:23.459 --> 00:56:26.958
It's Fula.
They must be from Senegal.

811
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.499
It means "white devil".

812
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.083
Βut why?
We're all in the same boat.

813
00:56:34.292 --> 00:56:35.624
You're a mulatto.

814
00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:38.666
For whites. you're black.
In Africa. you're white.

815
00:56:39.084 --> 00:56:41.291
Like those who threw us in here.

816
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.458
How do you say
"I'm with you"?

817
00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:02.624
White devil!

818
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.458
Step right up. ladies and gentlemen!
Get a closer look.

819
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:14.916
They'll increase
your plantation's profits in no time.

820
00:57:15.084 --> 00:57:18.458
Look how young and strong
they are!

821
00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:27.499
Let's stop for a while.

822
00:57:27.834 --> 00:57:30.708
It's been a long walk.
Τhe dogs are tired.

823
00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:31.958
Sit!

824
00:57:34.375 --> 00:57:35.874
- Cut off their feet?
- I No!

825
00:57:36.084 --> 00:57:37.374
You promised!

826
00:57:37.542 --> 00:57:39.333
You heard Mr Jourdain.

827
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.999
He won't pay us
if they're incomplete.

828
00:57:43.875 --> 00:57:46.124
I'll try and find some food.

829
00:57:46.292 --> 00:57:49.624
So. keep your eyes open
and behave!

830
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.166
C'mon. dogs!

831
00:58:27.792 --> 00:58:29.083
Are you there?

832
00:58:47.792 --> 00:58:51.124
- Maroons. are you there?
- Yes!

833
00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:52.791
Maroons. are you with me?

834
00:58:54.625 --> 00:58:57.458
We Maroons have broken our chains.

835
00:58:57.917 --> 00:59:00.333
We've run away
and become free!

836
00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:05.791
Today we welcome 2 new brothers.

837
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.291
Like us. they broke their chains.

838
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:12.124
- Maroons!
- Maroons! Maroons!

839
00:59:14.375 --> 00:59:15.999
What's your name. brother?

840
00:59:16.167 --> 00:59:17.874
- Joël!
- I No!

841
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:20.541
- Gédéon?
- I No!

842
00:59:21.459 --> 00:59:24.708
Τhey're slave names.
You're... Polydor.

843
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.124
- You're...
- Jean Moulin!

844
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:33.541
Jean Moulin.

845
00:59:36.459 --> 00:59:39.833
Maroons. will you fight
to free all our brothers?

846
00:59:41.667 --> 00:59:44.666
Maroons.
will you fight to the death?

847
00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:48.999
Will you fight for the black race?

848
00:59:50.875 --> 00:59:52.791
Will you kill all the whites?

849
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.833
- I No!
- Yes!

850
00:59:58.042 --> 00:59:59.999
Let's not overdo it.

851
01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.041
Let's just annoy 'em.

852
01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:06.708
A few slaps...

853
01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:09.624
Hurry!

854
01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:15.374
Run!

855
01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:04.374
Aunt?

856
01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:07.166
Why's she here?

857
01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:14.583
You took a long time to come. boys.

858
01:01:15.584 --> 01:01:18.166
You're the one who sent us here?

859
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.416
You witch!

860
01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:21.833
Calm down!

861
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.999
- Régis!
- I'll kill you!

862
01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:27.124
Calm down.

863
01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:32.874
- I'll kill you!
- Régis!

864
01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:35.458
Dammit. Régis!

865
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.249
Hey. calm down!

866
01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:39.624
Calm down...

867
01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:50.666
What did she say?

868
01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:52.916
- Dunno.
- You speak Creole.

869
01:01:54.042 --> 01:01:55.708
Τhat's literary Creole.

870
01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:58.124
I speak street Creole.

871
01:01:58.459 --> 01:01:59.666
Do you or don't you?

872
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:03.291
I can say things like
"My heart hurts"...

873
01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:05.499
"Baby. make love".

874
01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:08.416
You want to go home?

875
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.416
Your fate is in your own hands.

876
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.791
You were ripped
from your world. your families.

877
01:02:18.209 --> 01:02:21.833
sold like cattle.
you cut sugar cane.

878
01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:24.249
felt the sting of the whip.

879
01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:26.999
you were hunted like wild animals!

880
01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.041
I Now. boys.

881
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.666
have you understood?

882
01:02:36.542 --> 01:02:37.666
What?

883
01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:41.541
Sure we have! Τhe whip. cattle!
How do we go home?

884
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:45.458
If you've understood.
go back to your ancestors.

885
01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:48.083
Our ancestors?

886
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.999
Isidore and Rosalie.

887
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.333
Put things right

888
01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:56.291
and smoke the pipe.

889
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.999
Only then will you go home.

890
01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:05.999
- Τhey're our ancestors?
- No way.

891
01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.374
How do we put things right?

892
01:03:10.584 --> 01:03:13.166
Isidore can't be our ancestor.
He's a fag!

893
01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.958
- Let her speak.
- I have proof!

894
01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.833
Forget your sex problems!

895
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.291
I don't have any sex problems!

896
01:03:20.834 --> 01:03:22.249
I've had more chicks

897
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:23.749
than you!

898
01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:30.458
Don't ever say that again.

899
01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:37.458
Where is she?

900
01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:47.416
Maybe you don't mind
having a fag ancestor. but I do.

901
01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:49.666
It could be hereditary.

902
01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:51.249
Shut up about it!

903
01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:54.624
If Isidore was gay.
he couldn't be our ancestor.

904
01:03:55.459 --> 01:03:56.374
Oh. yeah?

905
01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:02.499
What's this. then?

906
01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:11.291
Aunt lied about Isidore...

907
01:04:12.084 --> 01:04:13.499
He isn't our ancestor.

908
01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.874
Or that's what we have to put right!

909
01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:20.208
- Meaning?
- A fag!

910
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.958
They don't have kids!

911
01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.833
Put it right
so we exist in the future.

912
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:29.541
- Τhink so?
- It's obvious!

913
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:32.708
We were sent
to help our ancestors reproduce.

914
01:04:36.209 --> 01:04:37.458
So. we have to do it.

915
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.624
We have to put it right.

916
01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:46.124
How do we justify our absence?

917
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.041
We'll get whipped.

918
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.874
Don't worry.

Children have such imagination!

- lt's... lynx.
- Wild lynx.

975
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:16.416
Don't you find this dance
a bit risqué. Father?

976
01:09:16.584 --> 01:09:19.833
Well. modern dances
are more and more obscene.

977
01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:24.499
You move up and you rub.
You rub...

978
01:09:24.667 --> 01:09:27.249
Now you go down. That's it.

979
01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:30.541
And back up again.
And that's called Zouk Love.

980
01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:36.458
- Enough!
- Don't stop now.

981
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.791
I'll have one last glass with you.

982
01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:40.624
Down in one!

983
01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:42.208
Come on!

984
01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:44.541

988
01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:59.583
- You don't want to kiss me now?
- I No. don't!

989
01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:01.749
You don't like me anymore?

990

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:13.374
Oh. Grandma!

994
01:10:15.584 --> 01:10:17.499
Don't you think Rosalie's hot?

995
01:10:19.209 --> 01:10:22.958
I saw her grow up.
She's like my little sister.

996
01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:24.624
Cut the crap!

997
01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:26.333
Look how she moves.

998
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:33.166
Τhat's enough!

999
01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:36.374
- I didn't do a thing.
- We're having fun.

1000
01:10:40.334 --> 01:10:41.916

You miss your negroes already?

1004
01:10:59.042 --> 01:11:01.749
You're not made for opulence.

1005
01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:07.458
Excuse me.

1006
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:19.208
- Why do I get Isidore?
- I don't trust you with Grandma!

1007
01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:21.791
- Go on.
- No. I really can't.

1008
01:11:21.959 --> 01:11:23.833
- We have no choice.

Let's not go just yet!

1024
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.083

You kiss me like in a dream.

That's for the possums!

1032
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.958
Τhat's enough!

1033
01:16:33.959 --> 01:16:35.166
With your big cocks!

1034
01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:58.249
Give me that!

1035
01:17:11.542 --> 01:17:12.374
Lock them up.

1036
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.166
We'll hang them at dawn.

1037
01:17:27.334 --> 01:17:28.624
Hey. be a man.

1038
01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.458
I don't wanna die here.

1039
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.166
Stop crying.

01:17:36.209 --> 01:17:37.916
Always being a whitie!

1041
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:41.708
I'm sick of your crap.

1042
01:17:43.209 --> 01:17:46.874
Your clichés about whites
and blacks behaving differently.

1043
01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:49.624
When I was in I Normandy.

1044
01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:52.041
I went to a private school.

1045
01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.958
I was the only
dark-skinned kid there.

1046
01:17:57.084 --> 01:18:00.958
I had to stand stupid nicknames:
Βabakar. Snow White...

1047
01:18:02.334 --> 01:18:04.874
Τhey stroked my hair
'cause it's soft.

1048
01:18:07.084 --> 01:18:10.083
I acted according to where I was.
not my color.

1049
01:18:13.542 --> 01:18:15.166
It's called integration.

1050
01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:17.541
Yeah. big deal!

1051
01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:20.416
You had it easy.

1052
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.374
You had whatever you wanted.

1053
01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:26.541
My life's been shitty!

1054
01:18:26.959 --> 01:18:29.249
- Τhat's not true!
- It is!

1055
01:18:30.209 --> 01:18:33.291
I too wanted to play piano.
be a scout!

1056
01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.249
Have a job like you!

1057
01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:38.666
A loving family. respect!

1058
01:18:51.584 --> 01:18:53.999
lt's OK. little brother.

1059
01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:57.333
Before it's too late.

1060
01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.458
I want to say something.

1061
01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:03.666
I lied to you!

1062
01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:06.999
I don't have a firm.

1063
01:19:09.167 --> 01:19:12.041
I live with my Mom.
I just got out of prison.

1064
01:19:13.209 --> 01:19:16.208
Because I stole an old woman's bag.

1065
01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:21.791
It's OK. I'm here now.

1066
01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:23.958
And I want to say

1067
01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:28.791
something I've never told anyone
before I go.

1068
01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:31.333
Yes. brother? I love you.

1069
01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.458
In prison...

1070
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:36.916
I felt so lonely...

1071
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.791
one night with my cellmate.

1072
01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:42.208
it got out of hand.

1073
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:45.999
We just touched.

1074
01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:56.374
I No penetration.

1075
01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:03.541
'Morning! Τime to go back
to swinging from trees!

1076
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:12.749
It isn't a good day
for the plantation.

1077
01:20:13.792 --> 01:20:15.041
As God is my witness.

1078
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:16.791
I warned these two.

1079
01:20:17.834 --> 01:20:19.541
Their intolerable behavior

1080
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.333
leaves me no choice
but to hang them.

1081
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:24.833
Mr Henri...

1082
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.083
Mr Victor!

1083
01:20:58.792 --> 01:21:00.958
Help! Help!

1084
01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:02.124
He's drowning!

1085
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:32.624
Τhank you.

1086
01:21:34.459 --> 01:21:35.291

1087
01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:40.249
Go away.

1088
01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:45.208
Go away!

1089
01:22:08.167 --> 01:22:09.041

1092
01:22:37.459 --> 01:22:38.291
Help!

1093
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.958
I can't swim!

1094
01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.208
I'm gonna drown!

1095
01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:55.458
Gédéon and Gaspard...

1096
01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:58.624
What will I do with you?

1097
01:23:00.084 --> 01:23:02.291
- I should hang you.
- We saved your...

1098
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.541
Silence!

1099
01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:08.333
Victor. my only son...

1100
01:23:09.209 --> 01:23:11.916
Father. take him to boarding school.

1101
01:23:13.584 --> 01:23:16.374
Victor asked me to free you both.

1102
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:22.958
You're free.

1103
01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:44.166
Here are your bills of freedom.

1104
01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:47.291
Τhank you.

1105
01:23:47.917 --> 01:23:48.833
Βut...

1106
01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:50.916
I'd like a favor.

1107
01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:56.666
I want Isidore to be freed instead.

1108
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.958
You sure about this?

1109
01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:07.249
Isidore has a life to build.

1110
01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:10.041
Our freedom is to go home.

1111
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.708
What'll you do?

1112
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:19.124
Don't worry about me.

1113
01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:24.124
Waiting for Isidore?

1114
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.708
I No.

1115
01:24:26.292 --> 01:24:27.499
I'll be going.

1116
01:24:30.042 --> 01:24:30.999
Well...

1117
01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:32.874
See you.

1118
01:24:38.084 --> 01:24:38.999
Joël!

1119
01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:44.208
Am I my brother's keeper?

1120
01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:07.666
I don't understand these negroes.

1121
01:26:09.209 --> 01:26:12.374
2 days ago. they run away.
Τhen they come back.

1122
01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:17.249
Τoday. I offer them their freedom.
Τhey ask me to free 2 other slaves.

1123
01:26:17.417 --> 01:26:19.124
I'm not surprised.

1124
01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:23.833
Τhe uprooting of these savages
often affects their behavior.

1125
01:26:24.209 --> 01:26:25.708
When I was in the Congo...

1126
01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:27.583
Enough. Father!

1127
01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:32.166
We all know
you never set foot in Africa.

1128
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:43.958
Τhank you.

1129
01:26:46.292 --> 01:26:47.916
I woke up in the barn.

1130
01:26:48.084 --> 01:26:50.499
Rosalie was by my side. you know?

1131
01:26:52.084 --> 01:26:54.624
I'm pleased for us...
I mean. for you.

1132
01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:13.916
Goodbye. Mr Victor!

1133
01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:22.624
Enough emotion!

1134
01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:26.958
Go on.

1135
01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:43.541

Bye. guys.

1139
01:28:52.667 --> 01:28:55.958

for a 2-month trial.

1140
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.833

- Minimum wage.

1141
01:29:11.625 --> 01:29:12.791

1142
01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:15.291

1143
01:29:23.042 --> 01:29:25.541
Hi. Régis.
How were the West Indies?

1144
01:29:26.542 --> 01:29:28.166
- Fine.
- They weren't...

1145
01:29:28.375 --> 01:29:29.791
late for the funeral?

1146
01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:37.208
What? It's a joke!

1147
01:29:38.417 --> 01:29:40.041
Lost your sense of humor?

1148
01:29:40.459 --> 01:29:43.374
It's just not funny.

1149
01:29:43.542 --> 01:29:45.499
You use my first name now?

1150
01:29:45.875 --> 01:29:47.749
You use mine. I use yours.

1151
01:29:48.209 --> 01:29:50.499
I'm not your slave. OK?

1152
01:29:51.459 --> 01:29:52.458
What's wrong?

1153
01:29:52.959 --> 01:29:55.124
- Look at this.
- What?

1154
01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:58.666
Fuck!

1155
01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.166
From now on. you'll respect me.

1156
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:05.083
Have a good weekend.

1157
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:15.916

I'm in no hurry.
