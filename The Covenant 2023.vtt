3
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.960
Turn off your truck and step out.

4
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.086
Why?

5
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:08.379
National Security.

6
00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:09.964
Shame on you bastard.

7
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.091
You are helping the infidels.

8
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.718
Could you kindly turn off the truck
and step out?

9
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.637
Make me if you can.

10
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.677
The truck is empty.

11
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:52.371
Peace be upon you. how are you?

12
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.206
What's going on?

13
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.125
U.S. Military brother.

14
00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.460
I can see that. What do you want?

15
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.213
They are looking for Taliban firearms.

16
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.799
I have nothing to do with those murderers.

17
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.092
I believe you.

18
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.678
But they need to believe you.

19
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.139
They're going to make their way in.

20
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.517
But they will be as quick as it takes
to confirm your innocence.

21
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:15.602
And your house will be left prettier.

22
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:17.938
Than the alternative.

23
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:49.454
Who are you?

24
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:50.872
What do you want?

25
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.457
You know who we are.

26
00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.218
This can go one of two ways. money or...

27
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.511
You traitor.

28
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.098
You have turned your back
on your own people.

29
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.684
I know who you are.

30
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.645
You're Ali's brother.

31
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.441
I will personally kill your entire family.

32
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.069
Your wife will see your death.

33
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.447
Just before I set the dogs on her.

34
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.370
I will tell you nothing.

35
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.524
That suit is for a hot little island
in the Caribbean.

36
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.986
The other is to buy yourself
something pretty.

37
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.534
What do they want to know?

38
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.961
Where is the Taliban's main location
for making bombs?

39
00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:27.510
It's not just one location.

40
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.220
And you know why?

41
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:34.142
But I've seen some places where they
make explosives and stock them.

42
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.378
You'll get more
if the information is good.

43
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.755
If you cut the Taliban's head off here

44
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.132
it will grow back someplace else.

45
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.518
Get on with it.

46
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.771
Just in these past two days new explosives

47
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.565
have been sent across the country.

48
00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.777
I was also supposed to be there and help.

49
00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:51.717
Put it down. put it down.

50
00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:57.056
Are you okay?

51
00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.100
Yes. yes I'm good.

52
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.893
Sit. sit.

53
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.229
You must rest.

54
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.191
Do you want me to get you something?

55
00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:09.777
I could eat some more.

56
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.448
Leave it to me.

57
00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:18.494
Did you hear about Hadyah's son?

58
00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:20.037
What happened to him?

59
00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:21.998
He's joined the Taliban.

60
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.917
And he won't talk to her anymore.

61
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:27.420
When I saw her she was crying.

62
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:31.716
Poor woman. first she loses her husband.
now this.

63
00:26:32.383 --> 00:26:34.427
I'm worried about him. Ahmed.

64
00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:38.764
What about our Special Immigration Visas?

65
00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:42.518
It takes time. Don't worry.

66
00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:51.485
I'm on it.

67
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.869
Why do the Talib always seem
to have their arms cache

68
00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:43.204
a hundred clicks from our base?

69
00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:46.248
Jizzy's hemorrhoids
won't be able to take it.

70
00:27:48.084 --> 00:27:49.293
This is our fourth tour here...

71
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.670
And what have we achieved apart
from losing Jack Jack?

72
00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.839
Even if we do find shit that goes bang...

73
00:27:54.924 --> 00:27:57.468
You think it's gonna make a difference
or bring him back?

74
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.429
What's that got to do
with Jizzy's hemorrhoids?

75
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:03.224
Why are you always talking about ass
Tom Cat?

76
00:28:03.974 --> 00:28:05.726
Where do you think
he got the name Tom Cat?

77
00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:09.355
We're here.

78
00:28:36.966 --> 00:28:37.800
Peace be upon you.

79
00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.552
Peace be upon you. How are you?

80
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:40.553
Good thank you.

81
00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:45.141
As you can see I'm with the U.S. Army.
we're here to conduct a search.

82
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:46.934
Are you the land owner?

83
00:28:47.977 --> 00:28:49.145
Yes. the land is mine.

84
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:50.354
What are you looking for here?

85
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:52.982
We're looking for explosives.

86
00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:54.442
Explosives?

87
00:28:54.817 --> 00:28:57.903
This is a closed mine. There has not
been any explosives here for years.

88
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.448
This shouldn't take long. Thank you.

89
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.578
Are you looking for the Taliban?

90
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.456
Yes. we're looking for Taliban.

91
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.291
I knew this would happen.

92
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:12.960
But you guys have come to the wrong place.

93
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:16.839
Down there is another plantation.

94
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.135
The Americans are here at the mine.

95
00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.387
The Americans have found the mine.

96
00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:25.347
Send the men there.

97
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.099
More soldiers are coming.

98
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:30.936
That's where you'll find the people
you are looking for.

99
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:32.813
Thank you.

100
00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:34.315
We will check there next.

101
00:29:35.483 --> 00:29:36.358
Welcome.

102
00:38:16.962 --> 00:38:19.506
We've found their car. they're on foot.

103
00:38:19.673 --> 00:38:23.051
I will send everyone.
go after them and kill them.

104
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.469
I want them alive.

105
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:26.805
Get them alive.

106
00:38:27.764 --> 00:38:29.182
Spread out. find them.

107
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.711
Listen my brothers.

108
00:49:24.796 --> 00:49:26.547
You will find them.

109
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:29.801
God is with you. not the infidels.

110
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.305
They are the enemy of our prophet.

111
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.934
{\an8}They are a long way from their base.

112
00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:41.604
{\an8}They will never get home.

113
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:45.108
It is your duty to bring them to justice.

114
00:49:46.526 --> 00:49:48.945
{\an8}I want them brought to me alive.

115
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:36.988
Stop him.

116
00:52:37.446 --> 00:52:38.531
He must die.

117
00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:39.740
I must kill him.

118
00:52:39.866 --> 00:52:40.700
Calm down brother.

119
00:52:40.867 --> 00:52:41.742
He must die.

120
00:52:41.826 --> 00:52:42.994
We need him alive.

121
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:43.953
Calm down.

122
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:45.037
Calm?

123
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.215
We've broken down. we need a ride.

124
00:57:48.424 --> 00:57:50.593
Okay. I will take you anywhere you want.

125
00:57:54.013 --> 00:57:56.307
Drive a few kilometers up this road.

126
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:57.725
Okay. I will take you.

127
00:58:00.269 --> 00:58:01.770
What are you doing out here brother?

128
00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:05.900
Looking for two men. an American
and the other. a Muslim traitor.

129
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:07.610
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

130
00:58:07.693 --> 00:58:10.905
I have seen no one. these roads are quiet.

131
00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:13.324
I am surprised to see even you.

132
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:16.327
We will find them. this is our territory.

133
00:58:19.038 --> 00:58:20.331
What's in the back?

134
00:58:20.915 --> 00:58:22.458
I'm a rug seller.

135
00:58:23.042 --> 00:58:24.418
Are you interested?

136
00:58:25.586 --> 00:58:26.545
Just drive.

137
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:39.266
Stop the truck.

138
00:58:39.642 --> 00:58:40.601
Stop the truck.

139
00:58:45.397 --> 00:58:46.649
Thank you.

140
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.235
Peace be upon you.

141
00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:10.214
Peace be upon you.

142
00:59:13.634 --> 00:59:16.095
Hello brother. how are you?

143
00:59:16.262 --> 00:59:17.638
Good thank you.

144
00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:20.975
I apologize for disturbing your meal.

145
00:59:22.184 --> 00:59:23.227
Sit.

146
00:59:23.936 --> 00:59:24.937
Thank you.

147
00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:28.983
Did you hunt those?

148
00:59:30.276 --> 00:59:32.569
You shall feast tonight.

149
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.494
Brother. I have a friend in the truck.
he's hurt.

150
00:59:41.328 --> 00:59:42.663
How can I help?

151
00:59:43.122 --> 00:59:46.709
We need some food and some pain relief.

152
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.754
And if you give me your wooden kart...

153
00:59:51.547 --> 00:59:53.841
I will give you my truck.

154
00:59:57.303 --> 00:59:58.721
May I see your friend?

155
00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:00.973
Of course.

156
01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.989
So you're the two they are looking for.

157
01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:21.952
I don't like Taliban.

158
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.871
I will help you.

159
01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:25.831
He needs opium.

160
01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.293
It will ease his pain.

161
01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.004
Thank you.

162
01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:36.342
There's a heavy price on your heads.

163
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.511
They have hundreds of Taliban
looking for you.

164
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.597
They have been village to village.

165
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.683
setting fire to those
that give no information.

166
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.436
They will not stop hunting you.

167
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.731
You are a long way from his base.

168
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.069
Do not use the roads.
patrols are everywhere.

169
01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.405
You must use the mountain passes.

170
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.684
Peace be upon you.

171
01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.144
Peace be upon you.

172
01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.399
Would you like something?

173
01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.235
Give me the water.

174
01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:09.990
Thank you.

175
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.314
Peace be upon you.

176
01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.191
Peace be upon you.

177
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.110
Hello brother.

178
01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:49.946
Give me water.

179
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.033
Hey. catch.

180
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:24.992
Taliban are here.

181
01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:27.703
Where?

182
01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:29.622
They are a few doors down.

183
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.874
Get out of there.

184
01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:33.084
Basira.

185
01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:36.170
I will have to move you again.

186
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.089
Leave now.

187
01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:39.674
Yes. I know. I know.

188
01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.468
Basira the bag. the bag.

189
01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:44.262
Let's go.

190
01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.601
They've executed Abdi.

191
01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:57.817
Your house is next.

192
01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.402
Let's go. let's go.

193
01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:02.822
Taliban heading towards you.

194
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.157
Wait. wait.

195
01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:05.366
Where. where?

196
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.576
He's approaching the back entrance.

197
01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:07.785
Wait.

198
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.040
He's twenty feet from the door.

199
01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:20.465
Twelve feet.

200
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:43.779
Three Taliban heading
towards your front door.

201
01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.123
The back door is clear.

202
01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:00.254
They're in your house.

203
01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.674
Out the back. turn right.

204
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.843
I see you.

205
01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.309
Get down. more Taliban are here.

206
01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:22.318
Move. now.

207
01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:11.109

208
01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:05.867
Goodbye.

209
01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:51.997
Show us the papers.

210
01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:55.792
Make it quick.

211
01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:44.007
Hello brothers.

212
01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.968
Turn off the engine.

213
01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:53.517
-Step out.
-What's the problem?

214
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.893
-I said step out.
-I paid for this.

215
01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:55.810
Step out.

216
01:36:55.936 --> 01:36:57.187
But. I paid for this.

217
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.358
What's in your truck?

218
01:37:01.441 --> 01:37:02.275
I paid for this.

219
01:37:02.359 --> 01:37:03.527
I said what's in your truck?

220
01:37:03.652 --> 01:37:05.403
Corn boxes. I have brought them
for your brothers.

221
01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:06.821
-Delivering. where to?
-Jalalabad.

So show us.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.245
Open this too.

224
01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:16.289
-You see.
-Be quiet son of a dog.

225
01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.002
There is nothing.

226
01:37:21.503 --> 01:37:22.712
Be quiet son of a dog.

227
01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:32.472
Take this money.

228
01:37:32.556 --> 01:37:34.099
I do not care about your money.

229
01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:36.309
I do not care about your money.

230
01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:38.562
Who are you to pay me?

231
01:37:39.396 --> 01:37:40.605
On your knees.

232
01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:15.932
Do you hear me Commander Satar?

233
01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:16.850
Fakhrudin?

234
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.435
We have trouble.

235
01:38:18.685 --> 01:38:21.479
Two men have killed our soldiers
at the checkpoint.

236
01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:23.607
Find out who they are.

237
01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:24.649

238
01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.109
Keep in contact.

239
01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:53.126
What is it?

240
01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:54.878
I found them.

241
01:42:55.044 --> 01:42:56.379
The American and Ahmed.

242
01:42:56.588 --> 01:42:58.423
Are you sure it's them?

243
01:42:58.882 --> 01:42:59.966
I'm positive.

244
01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:01.843
He's found John Kinley and Ahmed.

245
01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:03.136
Get men out there now.

246
01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:05.221
Follow them right now
and get their picture.

247
01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.124
It is John Kinley and Ahmed.

248
01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:04.822
Basira. this is John.

249
01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:17.293
Ahmed. what's going on?

250
01:44:17.919 --> 01:44:19.587
John has got us visas.

251
01:44:20.296 --> 01:44:21.714
We are going to America.

252
01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:43.361
Where are they?

253
01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:45.780
I have someone watching them.

254
01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:47.323
I'll take you there.

255
01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.187
Let's go.

256
01:45:34.162 --> 01:45:37.290
They are in the truck
heading towards the dam.

257
01:45:43.171 --> 01:45:44.881
They are heading towards the dam.

258
01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:47.675
Fakhrudin. listen to me very carefully.

259
01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:49.844
Do not let them get away.

260
01:45:49.927 --> 01:45:51.971
I want their heads
or else I'll take yours.
