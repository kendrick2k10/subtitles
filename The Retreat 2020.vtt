58
00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:44.707

that this was gonna be

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.330
some Airbnb share situation.

60
00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:48.538

I mean. she must be one hell
of a nice lady. [laughs]

89
00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:54.397
- Yeah sure. the man
does what he wants.

90
00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:55.329
[Marty laughing]

91
00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:56.848
- So where are you guys hiking?

92
00:04:56.882 --> 00:04:58.470
- Oh. we're gonna do
the three-day trip.

93
00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:01.887
We're gonna do Macomb.
South Dix. Grace. Hough.

94
00:05:01.922 --> 00:05:03.717
and Wright's Peak.

95
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:05.166
- Dope.

96
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.099
That's pretty ambitious
for this time of year.

97
00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:08.031
What's your route?

98
00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.413
- Well we're gonna
hike to a lean-to

99
00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:12.795
about six miles from
Adirondack Lodge.

100
00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.486
we'll camp out and the
next day we'll get up

101
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:16.281
and do Macomb and South Dix.

102
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.387
Day after that we'll
do Grace and Hough.

103
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.975
And if we have time for
another. we'll do that.

104
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.874
- I think I know the route
you're talking about.

105
00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:25.186
- You just be careful
out there. okay?

106
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:26.533
- I'm actually gonna
be heading up that way

107
00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:27.913
the day after.

108
00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:28.742
- Oh. well maybe
we'll run into you.

109
00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:29.570
- Yeah. yeah.

110
00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:31.296
- Probably not. [sighs]

111
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.436
I'm gonna be going
up the other side.

112
00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:35.162
No one does that
this time of year.

113
00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:36.301
It's too steep.

114
00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:41.996
I really just need a break
from everything. you know?

115
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:43.584
Starting to get a
little claustrophobic

116
00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:45.793
with all those right angles
everywhere. you know?

117
00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:48.589

118
00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:51.385
[Marty groaning]

119
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.697
- Marty. I got a question.

120
00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:55.838
- [Marty] Shoot.

121
00:05:55.872 --> 00:06:00.083
- What in the hell is up
with these things? [laughs]

122
00:06:00.118 --> 00:06:01.602
- That?

123
00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:05.641
That is the Wendigo. it's
sort of an urban legend

124
00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:06.849
around here.

125
00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:08.540
The Native Americans.
they have a legend

126
00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:11.405
that it protects the forest.

127
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.615
But for the most
part. it's a monster.

128
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.961
[ominous music]

129
00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:17.515
- What kind of monster?

130
00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:20.034
- Well. it can take
the form of say

131
00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.174
a vampire beast thing.

132
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.249
Hunts by sound or
the scent of blood.

133
00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:33.289
Or it can come in
the form of a spirit.

134
00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:36.672
It possesses a human.
it makes them a monster.

135
00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:39.295
[Adam humming]

136
00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:43.126
- Yeah. I know this.

137
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.956
It's that cannibal thing.

138
00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:47.441
- Yeah. I guess so.

139
00:06:47.476 --> 00:06:50.340
I mean. legend says it
preys on the most selfish.

140
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.791
the most corruptible.

141
00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:55.794
So I guess you could
call that cannibalism.

142
00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:57.486
- Anyway. it's creepy as shit.

143
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.797
I don't know why
it's in your house.

144
00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:01.455
[Marty laughing]

145
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.388
- Tell me you've seen one.

146
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.562
[jazzy music]

147
00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:06.287
- [laughs] Nope.

148
00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:11.292
My ex-wife. she just
had some strange tastes.

149
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.224
God bless her.

150
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.402
- Well. it's late.
I'm gonna try and get

151
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.610
one phone call in.

152
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:20.474
- Have a good hike if I
don't see you tomorrow

153
00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:21.406
before you leave.

154
00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:23.857
Be careful.

155
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:25.065
- [Adam] Thanks. Marty.

156
00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:28.965
- You know what?

157
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.589
I think I'll be calling
it a night. too.

158
00:07:31.623 --> 00:07:34.523
Hey guys. stay up
as long as you like.

159
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.565
- Tell me your thoughts
on psychedelic tea.

160
00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:50.504

[Gus moaning]

163
00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:01.481
- [Adam] Gus. come on.

164
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:02.309
[Gus moaning]

165
00:08:02.343 --> 00:08:06.071

[ominous music]

167
00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:10.006
- Dude. it's so damn cold.

168
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.387
What are you getting me into?

169
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:13.838
- Dude. relax. drink
some of your coffee.

170
00:08:16.185 --> 00:08:17.013
- No.

171
00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:20.741
- You hung over?

172
00:08:21.777 --> 00:08:23.226
- Nope.

173

Gus. we're here.

178
00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:04.060

like 23 minutes. max.

179
00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:05.061

00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:09.376
[Gus moaning]

183
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.515
- What the fuck. man.

184
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.827
- Come on. get ready.

185
00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:17.004
- Who decided this was
a good idea. anyway?

186
00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.834
I mean. isn't it supposed
to be quite dangerous

187
00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:20.352
to hike in the dark?

188
00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:22.631
- It's only dangerous if
you're cocky and stupid.

189
00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:26.704
You can be one or the other
but you can't be both.

190
00:09:26.738 --> 00:09:28.740
[ominous music]

191
00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:29.776
- Fuck this.

192
00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:42.478
[snow crunching]

193
00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:56.665
- [Adam] You good?

194
00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:57.562
- [Gus] Yeah.

195
00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:00.082
How long till we
get to the site?

196
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:02.567
- Like six more miles.

197
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.706
Didn't you read
anything I sent you?

198
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.019
- Yeah. just the
stuff in bold. though.

199
00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:07.296
- I didn't bold anything.

200
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.160
- You think we're
gonna see a bear?

201
00:10:09.194 --> 00:10:10.713
- Probably not.

202
00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:12.197
- How about big foot?

203
00:10:12.232 --> 00:10:13.371
- Maybe.

204
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:14.441
[trees rustling]

205
00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.029
- [Gus] What was that?

206
00:10:16.063 --> 00:10:16.961
- [Adam] Squatch.

207
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.169
- [Gus] No. I'm serious dude.

208
00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:21.897
- It's probably a stick or
something falling from a tree.

209
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:31.044
[leaves rustling]

210
00:10:31.078 --> 00:10:33.598
[eerie music]

211
00:10:39.052 --> 00:10:41.054
[Gus breathing]

212
00:10:41.088 --> 00:10:43.781
[crashing music]

213
00:10:47.854 --> 00:10:50.063
[snow crunching]

214
00:10:50.097 --> 00:10:51.374
[ominous music]

215
00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:54.446
- [Gus] So. Marty. that
dude's a character. huh?

216
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:55.965
- [Adam] Yeah. I liked him.

217
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.588
- [Gus] Was it just me or were
those pictures super creepy?

218
00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:00.038
- [Adam] The Wendigo?

219
00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:01.695
- [Gus] You know.
antlers and stuff?

220
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.698
- [Adam] I actually remember
something about it on TV.

221
00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:05.906
- [Gus] Yeah.

222
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:07.011
- [Adam] Supposedly
there's a thing called

223
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:09.392
Wendigo psychosis or something.

224
00:11:09.427 --> 00:11:11.084
People go crazy and delusional

225
00:11:11.118 --> 00:11:13.293
and they start thinking
they're being possessed.

226
00:11:13.327 --> 00:11:14.777
Pretty wild.

227
00:11:14.812 --> 00:11:17.400
Eventually they start thinking
the need to eat human flesh.

228
00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:19.333
- [Gus] Pretty creepy. huh?

229
00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.440
- [Adam] Who knows. maybe
Marty has a little touch of it.

230
00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.615
- [Gus] I was talking to
that Ryan guy last night.

231
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.582
- [Adam] Yeah. what about him?

232
00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:29.723
- [Gus] Hoo. interesting dude.

233
00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:31.380
He loves talking about drugs.

234
00:11:31.414 --> 00:11:32.588
And do you notice how many times

235
00:11:32.622 --> 00:11:34.763
he took a walk outside to smoke?

236
00:11:34.797 --> 00:11:36.040
Like an odd number of times.

237
00:11:36.074 --> 00:11:39.077
- [Adam] Ah. dude.
dude. this is it.

238
00:11:39.112 --> 00:11:40.285
Yeah.

239
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.528
I think the summit's
right up there.

240
00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:44.255
[dramatic music]

241
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:49.053
[wind blowing]

242
00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:24.847
[Adam sighing]

243
00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:25.745
- We did it. man.

244
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:27.781
- Yeah. we did.

245
00:12:28.817 --> 00:12:30.922
- Hey. I love you. buddy.

246
00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:34.305
- You too. man.

247
00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:37.446
- I got a surprise for you.

248
00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:39.655
- Oh. no.

249
00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:40.794
- Yeah.

250
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:42.347
So I was talking
to Ryan last night.

251
00:12:42.382 --> 00:12:45.695
He got ahold of this
tea. it's some peyote.

252
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.249
'shrooms. ayahuasca mix.

253
00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:49.285
The man loves his drugs.

254
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.805
- And?

255
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.082
- And I got some for us.

256
00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:55.429
What do you think?

257
00:12:56.603 --> 00:12:58.674
- Nah. I'm okay.

258
00:12:58.708 --> 00:12:59.951
- Come on. man.

259
00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:00.918
Just a little bit.

260
00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:05.508
I mean. when we get to the
summit. let's have some fun.

261
00:13:07.752 --> 00:13:08.615
- I'm okay.

262
00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:09.547
Thank you. though.

263
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.550
But if you wanna do it
I will totally spot you.

264
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.621
- [laughs] Spot me?

265
00:13:17.037 --> 00:13:18.521
Nah.

266
00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:19.868
You're my best man.

267
00:13:19.902 --> 00:13:20.972
Just like I'm yours.

268
00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.941
I'm not gonna do it without you.

269
00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:26.495
- Okay. then.

270
00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:30.948
- All right.

271
00:13:32.225 --> 00:13:35.124
So. now we just what?

272
00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:35.987
Go down?

273
00:13:39.473 --> 00:13:42.131
[Adam grunting]

274
00:13:43.753 --> 00:13:45.031
Heading down the mountain.

275
00:13:46.687 --> 00:13:50.036
[ominous music]

276
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.106
- [Adam] We're running
out of daylight.

277
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.348
- [Gus] We'll be fine.

278
00:13:52.383 --> 00:13:54.523
- [Adam] Yeah. thanks
Gus. that's helpful.

279
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:56.628
This is how people get
lost and die. dude.

280
00:13:56.663 --> 00:13:59.908
One wrong turn. one mile the
wrong way. and then boom!

281
00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:02.013
They find your body with
a note on it saying.

282
00:14:02.048 --> 00:14:04.809
"Sorry. I'm an idiot. love Gus."

283
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:05.637
- [Gus] Relax!

284
00:14:05.672 --> 00:14:06.466
- [Adam] I'm relaxed.

285
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.329
You relax.

286
00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:11.229
- [Gus] Hey dude. I
think I found something.

287
00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:14.577
Yeah. this is definitely
our footsteps. right?

288
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:24.864
Here we are.

289
00:14:26.003 --> 00:14:27.901
Even with a little
light to spare.

290
00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:29.592
- [Adam] You did it.

291
00:14:29.627 --> 00:14:30.455
- We did it.

292
00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:34.977
- [Adam] We should probably
start setting stuff up.

293
00:14:35.978 --> 00:14:37.117
- [Gus] Yep. okay.

294
00:14:46.161 --> 00:14:47.817
- [Adam] What's that. Gus?

295
00:14:47.852 --> 00:14:49.164
- Nothing.

296
00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:50.510
- [Adam] You sure about that?

297
00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:52.132
- About what?

298
00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:56.136
- Like the safety and stuff?

299
00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:58.380
- I have done everything
under the sun.

300
00:14:58.414 --> 00:14:59.899
Gonna be fine. man.

301
00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:02.108
We trip balls tonight. be
back out there tomorrow.

302
00:15:02.142 --> 00:15:04.317
- Like we'll see stuff?

303
00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:06.388
- With this?

304
00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:07.251
Maybe.

305
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.529
Probably.

306
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:15.845
- I'll take one very small sip.

307
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.777
- [Gus] No way.

308
00:15:22.852 --> 00:15:24.302
[Adam sighing]

309
00:15:24.337 --> 00:15:25.994
Dude. yes!

310
00:15:29.238 --> 00:15:30.515
[Adam groaning]

311
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.344
- You happy?

312
00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:32.655
Your turn.

313
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.695
- Yeah? [laughs]

314
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.292
[sighs]

315
00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:53.262
- [Adam] Now what?

316
00:15:55.057 --> 00:15:55.920
- Now we wait.

317
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.752
[ominous music]

318
00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:08.174
[fire crackling]

319
00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:26.054
[snow crunching]

320
00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:31.093
[Adam grunting]

321
00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:36.823
- Are you feeling it?

322
00:16:37.858 --> 00:16:38.825
- [Gus] I think so.

323
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:42.587
Unless this bottle
really is breathing.

324
00:16:43.554 --> 00:16:44.382
- Really?

325
00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:46.350
- Yeah.

326
00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:51.907
Like in and out.
expanding. contracting.

327
00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:57.395
- Oh yeah. I see it.

328
00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:01.227
Well maybe it's because of
the hot air on the inside

329
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:03.401
expanding from the cold
air on the outside.

330
00:17:03.436 --> 00:17:06.818
[Gus laughing]

331
00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:08.303
- That's not how it works.

332
00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:12.997
I think you're feeling it.

333
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.205
- I am feeling it.

334
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.691
I was just reading my book

335
00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:19.935
and then I starting
thinking about stuff.

336
00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:23.111
And then. my thoughts
became a part of the book.

337
00:17:25.527 --> 00:17:30.049
And then I thought. well
maybe I'm merging with

338
00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.222
one with the book.

339
00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:37.918
And then. I thought. well
that's it. I'm a book.

340
00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:43.131
Someone will have to explain
to my parents and Amy

341
00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:44.166
that I'm a book now.

342
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:49.309
But. I don't even know
the writer of the book.

343
00:17:49.344 --> 00:17:50.759
I mean. am I the
writer of the book.

344
00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:53.693
or is that someone else
that's the writer of the book

345
00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:55.315
'cause they're writing about me?

346
00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:58.284
But it's my thoughts. so then.

347
00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:01.632
I mean. does the
book just keep going.

348
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:06.671
or does it stop. or. I mean.
where does the book end

349
00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:12.781
from me. even though
I'm writing it?

350
00:18:14.023 --> 00:18:16.854
- [Gus] Hey man.
you're not a book.

351
00:18:23.412 --> 00:18:24.206
- [Adam] Thanks.

352
00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:27.623
- Goddamn it man. my feet hurt.

353
00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:30.833
I got these blisters.

354
00:18:34.285 --> 00:18:36.218
And then. my foot
started bleeding.

355
00:18:38.772 --> 00:18:40.153
And it bled through my sock.

356
00:18:44.295 --> 00:18:45.572
- You didn't try them on.

357
00:18:46.849 --> 00:18:50.198
Dude. I told you that
you'd bliss them.

358
00:18:50.232 --> 00:18:52.165
- I did. that's how
I got the blisters.

359
00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:56.583
[Adam and Gus laughing]

360
00:18:58.413 --> 00:18:59.828
- Oh. wow.

361

387
00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:47.487
- Yeah. why are you
getting so defensive?

388
00:20:48.695 --> 00:20:51.491

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.037
Too many intros.

500
00:36:52.071 --> 00:36:53.383
It's like sure. people

501
00:36:53.418 --> 00:36:54.936
some are even interested.

502
00:36:54.971 --> 00:36:58.077
but most of the time they're
just waiting for it to be over.

503
00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.389
Like a drum solo.

504
00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:03.048
- Why are you being such a dick?

505
00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:05.257

I've been waiting here alone

506
00:37:05.292 --> 00:37:07.880

525
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.955
which might be a good thing.

526
00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:52.580
We talked about after the
wedding finding somewhere that--

527
00:37:52.615 --> 00:37:53.926
- [Gus] No. no. it's okay.

528
00:37:56.998 --> 00:37:57.965
- [Adam] It's not like--

529
00:37:57.999 --> 00:37:59.207

530
00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:00.485
Actually. you and
I. we need to still

531
00:38:00.519 --> 00:38:01.520

532
00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:02.694
- What bachelor party?

533
00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:05.213
- Are you kidding me?

534
00:38:05.248 --> 00:38:07.768
- Seriously. I told you
not to worry about it.

535
00:38:07.802 --> 00:38:10.149
- I know. I know. you
said nothing crazy.

536
00:38:10.184 --> 00:38:11.323
and I'm not gonna.

537
00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:12.566

could do anything.

538
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.878
anything at all.
what would you do?

539
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:19.227

540
00:38:21.782 --> 00:38:22.610

543
00:38:29.583 --> 00:38:31.378
- High peaks. Adirondacks.

544
00:38:31.412 --> 00:38:32.724
You wouldn't be interested.

545
00:38:32.758 --> 00:38:34.173
- Oh. hiking.
- Two weeks from the wedding.

546
00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:35.796
and it'll be pretty cold.

547
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.660
- No. let's do it.

548
00:38:37.694 --> 00:38:39.317
- Really?

549
00:38:39.351 --> 00:38:40.801
- Yeah.

550
00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:44.114
- I know a great trail. we
could hit four or five peaks

551
00:38:44.149 --> 00:38:45.046
in three days.

552
00:38:45.081 --> 00:38:45.944
- I love it. man.

553
00:38:47.635 --> 00:38:49.810
- Okay. okay yeah. let's do it.

554
00:38:49.844 --> 00:38:51.294
- [Gus] That's awesome. man.

555
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:52.744
Hey. could we grab two more
of those tequila shots?

556
00:38:52.778 --> 00:38:53.572
- Oh. I...

557
00:38:53.607 --> 00:38:54.401
- [Gus] Come on. man.

558
00:38:54.435 --> 00:38:55.263
- All right. fine.

559
00:38:55.298 --> 00:38:56.092
Let's do it.

560
00:38:56.126 --> 00:38:58.336
- Yes! [taps on bar top]

561
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.198
- Thanks.

562
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.340
- Okay. to you and Amy.

563
00:39:02.374 --> 00:39:03.410
- [Adam] Cheers.
[glasses clinking]

564
00:39:03.444 --> 00:39:04.307
- Cheers.

565
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.828
[Adam groaning]

566
00:39:07.862 --> 00:39:09.139
- [groans] Grab two
more of those. please.

567
00:39:09.174 --> 00:39:10.382
- [Adam] So I was
thinking maybe--

568
00:39:10.417 --> 00:39:11.245
- Those ones over there.

569
00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:12.177
- [Adam] We could--

570
00:39:12.211 --> 00:39:12.902
- Hey. would you wingman me?

571
00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:14.144
- [Adam] What?

572
00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:15.870
- [Gus] Those two over there.

573
00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:17.216
Just wingman me.

574
00:39:17.251 --> 00:39:18.597
- I told you. I can't
stay out late. I got--

575
00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:20.254
- Yeah. I know. dude.

576
00:39:20.288 --> 00:39:22.256
No worries. but this
is the same kinda place

577
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.740
you met Amy at. right?

578
00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:25.811
Who was your wingman?

579
00:39:27.434 --> 00:39:30.747
- Okay. one more drink.
only because I love you.

580
00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:32.370
- As do I.

581
00:39:32.404 --> 00:39:34.648
Come on. grab one of those.

582
00:39:37.582 --> 00:39:40.378
[fire crackling]

583
00:39:51.216 --> 00:39:53.874

[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

589
00:41:19.028 --> 00:41:22.134
What the fuck are you
looking at? [gasps]

590
00:41:23.895 --> 00:41:24.792
Don't ignore me.

591
00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:27.933
What are you doing?

592
00:41:29.935 --> 00:41:31.074
Trying to survive.

593
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:32.938
Why?

594
00:41:36.563 --> 00:41:38.392
Why. what do you mean?

595
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:40.739
I mean. what's the point?

596
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.054
You listening?

597
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.303
And if we do make it
out of here. then what?

598
00:41:57.135 --> 00:41:58.861
I don't know.

599
00:41:58.895 --> 00:42:00.518
You killed your best friend.

600
00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:02.485
No.

601
00:42:03.624 --> 00:42:05.246
[laughs] What do you mean. no?

602
00:42:06.834 --> 00:42:07.628
Wasn't me.

603
00:42:08.802 --> 00:42:12.564
Oh. so somebody else
stole your knife.

604
00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:14.946
dragged him out. and killed him?

605
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.431
And then smeared his
blood all over you.

606
00:42:17.465 --> 00:42:18.570
Wasn't his blood.

607
00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:23.541
You're losing
grip. man. [laughs]

608
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:27.372
It did...

609
00:42:30.927 --> 00:42:32.998
It was an accident.

610
00:42:33.033 --> 00:42:35.242
Oh well. I'm sure Amy
would understand that.

611
00:42:36.933 --> 00:42:38.141
He was your best friend.

612
00:42:39.798 --> 00:42:43.112
Fuck man. he chose you
to be his best man!

613
00:42:44.907 --> 00:42:48.531
And like always. like
the little cock you are.

614
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:52.570
you let him down. [tsks]

615
00:42:52.604 --> 00:42:55.193
Oh. you manipulated
the situation

616
00:42:55.227 --> 00:42:57.057
to serve your needs and wants.

617
00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:02.752
You shouldn't have
drank that tea.

618
00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:04.443
I know. [cries]

619
00:43:04.478 --> 00:43:06.860
Shut the fuck up.
you shut the fuck up.

620
00:43:07.964 --> 00:43:09.000
We get off on it.

621
00:43:10.346 --> 00:43:13.418
Without Adam enabling
every urge and whim.

622
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:15.662
What are you?

623
00:43:18.078 --> 00:43:21.391
I... [sputters]

624
00:43:21.426 --> 00:43:22.254
[tuts]

625
00:43:22.289 --> 00:43:23.842
This.

626
00:43:23.877 --> 00:43:25.016
This is what you are.

627
00:43:26.396 --> 00:43:29.434
Sad. pathetic. and alone.

628
00:43:32.713 --> 00:43:35.613

[Gus moaning]

637
00:45:37.458 --> 00:45:40.772
[Gus breathing heavily]

638
00:45:55.235 --> 00:45:57.824
[horn blowing]

639
00:46:17.878 --> 00:46:21.502
[Gus crying and sniffling]

640
00:46:38.209 --> 00:46:39.037
Sorry.

641
00:46:52.257 --> 00:46:53.086
I'm sorry.

642
00:47:01.784 --> 00:47:04.269
[Gus gasping]

643
00:47:15.418 --> 00:47:18.766

[Gus inhaling]

653
00:49:31.209 --> 00:49:32.038
Thank you.

654
00:49:36.214 --> 00:49:37.457
How did you--

655
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:39.217
- You were right off
my snowmobile route.

656
00:49:47.191 --> 00:49:51.885
Beth and I. we used
to go to that cabin.

657
00:49:51.919 --> 00:49:55.647
Two. three. [laughs]
four times a month.

658
00:49:58.892 --> 00:50:01.032
Two years ago. she
went by herself.

659
00:50:02.447 --> 00:50:03.276
With the dog.

660
00:50:07.452 --> 00:50:10.283
The dog never did come
back. and Beth. well.

661
00:50:14.218 --> 00:50:17.669
she came back but
not really. I mean...

662
00:50:21.604 --> 00:50:26.609
The Windigo. it's not the
monster that consumes you.

663
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.923
[ominous music]

664
00:50:29.957 --> 00:50:31.028
They're just animals.

665
00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:34.755
But what's dangerous is.

666
00:50:36.412 --> 00:50:39.036
is the spirit. the idea.

667
00:50:43.247 --> 00:50:45.559
Beth was a good woman.

668
00:50:48.976 --> 00:50:53.947
Flawed. yeah. but
she was a good woman.

669
00:50:56.984 --> 00:50:58.745
And her mind started
playing tricks on her.

670
00:50:58.779 --> 00:51:02.024
these cruel. cruel games.

671
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:07.064
Until she wasn't
herself anymore.

672
00:51:12.552 --> 00:51:17.212
So resist it if you can.

673
00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:18.454
If it's not too late.

674
00:51:23.804 --> 00:51:25.358
The deputies will be here soon.

675
00:51:26.566 --> 00:51:28.361
You better have
your story straight.

676
00:51:37.266 --> 00:51:39.958
[phone ringing]

677
00:51:40.856 --> 00:51:41.684

678
00:51:43.203 --> 00:51:44.239
Yes. this is she.

679
00:51:52.385 --> 00:51:53.800
I'm sorry. what happened?

680
00:52:00.324 --> 00:52:03.637
And when did you find him?

681
00:52:11.024 --> 00:52:13.613
What do you mean
you can't find him?

682
00:52:14.476 --> 00:52:15.718
[Gus coughing]

683
00:52:15.753 --> 00:52:17.237
Yeah. I understand that
you're trying it's best.

684
00:52:17.272 --> 00:52:20.413
I'm just trying to figure
out why you can't find him

685
00:52:20.447 --> 00:52:22.139
and why Gus doesn't
know anything.

686
00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:25.866
[Gus gasping]

687
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:31.044

[door creaking]

694
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.095
I want answers. Gus. I
want answers right now!

695
00:53:22.129 --> 00:53:23.717
- Amy. I told you. everything
that I knew that happened--

696
00:53:23.752 --> 00:53:25.788
- Oh. my God. no. yeah.
I know what you said.

697
00:53:25.823 --> 00:53:27.514
Tell me what happened.

698
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:28.550
- I told them!

699
00:53:28.584 --> 00:53:29.378
- Tell me.

700
00:53:29.413 --> 00:53:30.621
Oh no. bullshit.

701
00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:32.036
Oh. he just gets up in
the middle of the night.

702
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.762
Gets lost. that's it.

703
00:53:33.796 --> 00:53:34.832
I don't fucking buy it.

704
00:53:34.866 --> 00:53:36.351
- I don't know what to tell you

705
00:53:36.385 --> 00:53:37.662
that's any different than
I've already said to you.

706
00:53:37.697 --> 00:53:39.423
- [Amy] Oh. shit Gus.

707
00:53:39.457 --> 00:53:40.251
[Gus laughing]

708
00:53:40.286 --> 00:53:41.494
You're a piece of shit.

709
00:53:41.528 --> 00:53:42.426
You couldn't give
him a fucking inch

710
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.116
without needing to consume--

711
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:44.048
- Please!

712
00:53:44.082 --> 00:53:45.222
- [Amy] No. I'm not leaving.

713
00:53:46.361 --> 00:53:48.328
Why did you even have
to go on this trip?

714
00:53:51.435 --> 00:53:53.299
[eerie music]

715
00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:54.990
- [Gus] Excuse me.

716
00:53:55.024 --> 00:53:57.751
These photos. the same
ones but different.

717
00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:00.133
- [Amy] Fuck you.

718
00:54:00.167 --> 00:54:02.135
- Were they the same
when you came in here?

719
00:54:02.169 --> 00:54:02.998
- Really?

720
00:54:06.967 --> 00:54:09.729
[crashing music]

721
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.767
Like every time.
you let him down

722
00:54:13.802 --> 00:54:16.667
and you manipulated him into
doing what you wanted to do.

723
00:54:19.566 --> 00:54:21.879
You shouldn't have
drank that tea.

724
00:54:21.913 --> 00:54:23.915
- What did you just say?

725
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.055
- I said you shouldn't
have drank the tea.

726
00:54:29.058 --> 00:54:30.888
- I never told
anybody about the tea.

727
00:54:32.683 --> 00:54:34.340
- The fuck are
you talking about?

728
00:54:37.204 --> 00:54:39.414
[crashing music]

729
00:54:39.448 --> 00:54:41.450
Hey. are you kidding me?

730
00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:44.833
Gus. you need to tell me
what the fuck happened

731
00:54:44.867 --> 00:54:47.318
because I know you fucking know.

732
00:54:47.353 --> 00:54:48.388
I know you know. okay?

733
00:54:48.423 --> 00:54:50.666
Just tell me what happened?

734
00:54:53.531 --> 00:54:56.051
[woman speaking in
foreign language]

735
00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:58.571
[eerie music]

736
00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:04.335
Shouldn't have drank that tea.

737
00:55:05.957 --> 00:55:10.859
- [Therapist] Gus. do you
know where you are right now?

738
00:55:10.893 --> 00:55:13.965
[heartbeat pounding]

739
00:55:19.039 --> 00:55:21.525
[eerie music]

740
00:55:42.442 --> 00:55:45.031
[wind rushing]

741
00:55:46.964 --> 00:55:48.275
- [Adam] Morning. asshole.

742
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.040
I don't think we'll be
able to hit up South Dix

743
00:55:54.074 --> 00:55:54.903
or Hough today.

744
00:55:57.768 --> 00:56:00.978
- Wait. wait. what do you mean?

745
00:56:01.012 --> 00:56:02.393
- Well. Sleeping Beauty
has been sleeping

746
00:56:02.428 --> 00:56:03.808
for like 16 hours.

747
00:56:05.154 --> 00:56:05.983
- What?

748
00:56:08.434 --> 00:56:11.126
[ominous music]

749
00:56:13.439 --> 00:56:14.301
You're...

750
00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:20.963
You good?

751
00:56:20.998 --> 00:56:21.895
- Yeah. I'm fine.

752
00:56:23.345 --> 00:56:25.727
Maybe when we get up Dix
we can hit another ridge.

753
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:28.661
There's a mug of cold
coffee over there.

754
00:56:28.695 --> 00:56:30.697
when you finally get
your ass outta bed.

755
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:35.219
[Gus breathing heavily]

756
00:56:40.604 --> 00:56:43.365
[snow crunching]

757
00:56:47.058 --> 00:56:49.751
- Hey. can we talk.

758
00:56:49.785 --> 00:56:50.752
- [Adam] What's up?

759
00:56:58.345 --> 00:57:01.003
[ominous music]

760
00:57:04.248 --> 00:57:07.354
[creature screaming]

761
00:57:13.878 --> 00:57:15.362
[branches cracking]

762
00:57:15.397 --> 00:57:18.400
- [Therapist] I said. where do
you think you are right now?

763
00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:21.921
[fire crackling]

764
00:57:21.955 --> 00:57:23.267
Tell me about this fight.

765
00:57:25.856 --> 00:57:27.340
- What fight?

766
00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:29.169
- The one by the fire.

767
00:57:29.204 --> 00:57:30.447
The night he disappeared.

768
00:57:31.896 --> 00:57:34.589
You said he got angry
and stormed off?

769
00:57:35.521 --> 00:57:38.558
- Oh. right. [clears throat]

770
00:57:38.593 --> 00:57:41.768
- [hums] Why do
you think that was?

771
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:45.600
- I don't know.

772
00:57:46.532 --> 00:57:47.360
- Really?

773
00:57:49.189 --> 00:57:50.501
- I think that...

774
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.092
I think Amy had put
it into his head

775
00:57:55.126 --> 00:57:58.129
that I was trying
to separate them.

776
00:57:58.164 --> 00:57:58.958
- And were you?

777
00:57:58.992 --> 00:57:59.821
- No.

778
00:58:01.305 --> 00:58:05.758
I mean. I want Adam to
be happy. and he can't...

779
00:58:08.899 --> 00:58:12.109
[exhales] Sometimes
he needs help.

780
00:58:12.143 --> 00:58:13.179
- As do we all.

781
00:58:14.836 --> 00:58:18.080
Can you tell me about your
previous relationships?

782
00:58:18.115 --> 00:58:19.219
- Nothing much to say.

783
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.221
- [laughs] Nothing?

784
00:58:24.362 --> 00:58:27.055
- I had a girlfriend
a few years back

785
00:58:27.089 --> 00:58:29.713
but she moved. so...

786
00:58:31.438 --> 00:58:33.268
Nothing serious since then.

787
00:58:33.302 --> 00:58:34.649
- Would you say that Adam

788
00:58:34.683 --> 00:58:36.513
was your most
serious relationship?

789
00:58:38.066 --> 00:58:40.309
- [laughs] What?

790
00:58:40.344 --> 00:58:41.172
Really?

791
00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:43.450
- Not sexually.

792
00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:47.765
- He's my best friend.

793
00:58:49.111 --> 00:58:50.216
- But were you his?

794
00:58:52.563 --> 00:58:53.391
- Yeah.

795
00:58:56.671 --> 00:58:57.534
I think so.

796
00:58:58.949 --> 00:59:01.572
- Is there any chance
that during the trip

797
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:05.093
you realized the nature
of your relationship

798
00:59:05.127 --> 00:59:08.855
was not as you suspected.
and as a result acted out?

799
00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:12.445
Do you still dream of him.

800
00:59:12.479 --> 00:59:14.930
dream you're still
in the forest?

801
00:59:14.965 --> 00:59:16.483
I'll tell you what I think. Gus.

802
00:59:16.518 --> 00:59:19.486
I think you created a
reality in your mind

803
00:59:19.521 --> 00:59:22.904
in which you didn't kill
and eat your friend.

804
00:59:28.047 --> 00:59:29.738
- What's that?

805
00:59:29.773 --> 00:59:32.327
[crashing music]

806
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:33.915
- What?

807
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:37.263
- That painting. it's the thing.

808
00:59:37.297 --> 00:59:39.783
[eerie music]

809
00:59:42.751 --> 00:59:44.063
- What do you see. Gus?

810
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:47.238
- Hey. hey. hey. okay Gus.

811
00:59:47.273 --> 00:59:49.655
Hey. it's okay. it's okay.
it's okay. it's okay.

812
00:59:50.517 --> 00:59:52.796
[Gus breathing heavily]

813
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.038
You're all right. okay?

814
01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:01.459
- What happened?

815
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.152
- You tripped and fell
and hit your head.

816
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.568
You okay?

817
01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.396
How's your head feel?

818
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:08.812
- Hurts.

819
01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.054
- [Adam] Okay.

820
01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:11.746
Okay. come on. let's
get you up. all right?

821
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.644
[ominous music]

822
01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:14.818
[Gus moaning]

823
01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:16.440
Okay. okay. hey. what
is it. what is it?

824
01:00:16.474 --> 01:00:17.372
- [Gus] Ankle.

825
01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.029
- [Adam] Okay. all right.

826
01:00:19.063 --> 01:00:21.583
Okay. all right.
stay right here.

827
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.861
All right. come on. we
gotta get you off this.

828
01:00:23.896 --> 01:00:24.655
Gotta find you help.

829
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:25.518
- [Gus] No. let's go.

830
01:00:25.552 --> 01:00:26.346
- [Adam] Yes. Gus.

831
01:00:26.381 --> 01:00:27.278
- [Gus] It's fine.

832
01:00:27.313 --> 01:00:28.003
- [Adam] Gus. we're gonna find--

833
01:00:28.038 --> 01:00:28.832
- It's fine!

834
01:00:28.866 --> 01:00:29.695
Let's keep going.

835
01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.802
- [Adam] All right.

836
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.357
[ominous music]

837
01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:48.610
[snow crunching]

838
01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:56.273
- [Gus] Hey. can we just...

839
01:00:56.307 --> 01:00:57.757
One second.

840
01:00:57.792 --> 01:01:01.658
Thank you. I'm gonna just
sit down for a second.

841
01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:09.562
- How's the ankle?

842
01:01:09.596 --> 01:01:10.701
- [Gus] It's fine.

843
01:01:10.736 --> 01:01:11.668
[zipper buzzing]

844
01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:12.392
Just sprained. I can walk.

845
01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:13.221
- Gus.

846
01:01:13.255 --> 01:01:14.084
- [Gus] What?

847
01:01:15.361 --> 01:01:16.673
- [Adam] Nevermind. nothing.

848
01:01:19.848 --> 01:01:20.953
Isn't that the tea?

849
01:01:22.402 --> 01:01:26.717
- What? [coughs]

850
01:01:28.892 --> 01:01:30.065
Goddamn it.

851
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.411
Adam. I gotta tell
you something.

852
01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.726
The other night. when we
were drinking the tea.

853
01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:38.280
- Look man. I know
things got negative and--

854
01:01:38.315 --> 01:01:39.143
- There's more. there's more.

855
01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:40.662
It's...

856
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:42.664
Okay.

857
01:01:43.838 --> 01:01:47.807
Okay. so we both.
we fall asleep.

858
01:01:47.842 --> 01:01:51.431
but I wake up and there
was this. the thing.

859
01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:55.090
- Holy shit! [speaks
in foreign language]

860
01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:56.057
[Ryan laughing]

861
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.265
- [Adam] Hey. Ryan. right?

862
01:01:57.299 --> 01:01:58.507
- Yep. Adam.

863
01:01:58.542 --> 01:01:59.681
Gus. right?

864
01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.649
[snow crunching]

865
01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:03.512
Crazy.

866
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.378
Decided to take a
little detour. [laughs]

867
01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:10.796
You guys going up or down?

868
01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:11.658
- [Adam] Down.

869
01:02:11.693 --> 01:02:12.556
Gus had an accident.

870
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:13.453
- Yeah. now.

871
01:02:15.076 --> 01:02:16.146
That does not look okay.

872
01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.528
- [Gus] It's fine. [brushes leg]

873
01:02:19.563 --> 01:02:20.391
- Cool.

874
01:02:22.014 --> 01:02:22.842
I'll join you.

875
01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:25.811
Come on. I got a good site.

876
01:02:25.845 --> 01:02:26.708
Whoop!

877
01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:31.299
- [Gus] I got it.

878
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.128
Dude.

879
01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:36.787
- [Adam] All right.

880
01:02:39.825 --> 01:02:42.586
[snow crunching]

881
01:02:47.315 --> 01:02:49.904
[wind blowing]

882
01:03:09.406 --> 01:03:11.718
[fire crackling]

883
01:03:11.753 --> 01:03:14.825
[Ryan coughing]

884
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.000
- Super weird coincidence.

885
01:03:17.034 --> 01:03:19.002
You said you were
coming down from Hough?

886
01:03:19.036 --> 01:03:19.934
- Yeah.

887
01:03:19.968 --> 01:03:22.626
Shit. [laughs]

888
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:25.698
I thought I was at Dix.

889
01:03:28.045 --> 01:03:30.323
I drank some of
that tea last night.

890
01:03:31.773 --> 01:03:32.947
it really fucked me up.

891
01:03:32.981 --> 01:03:33.810
- It did?

892
01:03:35.018 --> 01:03:38.642
- [laughs] Oh right.
I gave you some.

893
01:03:38.676 --> 01:03:39.919
You guys go tripping yet?

894
01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:42.439
You wanna?

895
01:03:42.473 --> 01:03:43.716
- Oh. we drank some yesterday.

896
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.235
- [Ryan] How much?

897
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:46.408
- I took a sip.

898
01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:48.169
This guy practically
chugged the whole thing.

899
01:03:48.203 --> 01:03:49.101
- Fuck.

900
01:03:49.135 --> 01:03:51.206
Dude. that's way too much.

901
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:52.725
- Thanks.

902
01:03:52.759 --> 01:03:55.555
- I mean. you must have gotten
pretty fucking messed up.

903
01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:57.626
You're crazy. man.

904
01:03:59.318 --> 01:04:00.181
Both you guys.

905
01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:06.359
[coughs] Fuck.

906
01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.673
This is cool.

907
01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:14.126
You want a hit?

908
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.161
- No. I'm good.

909
01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.512
- All right. fuck it.

910
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:26.034
- [Ryan] Yeah! [laughs]

911
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:29.141
[Adam coughing]

912
01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:30.728
- [Gus] What was that?

913
01:04:30.763 --> 01:04:32.869
- It's the wind. bro.

914
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.388
- [Gus] Right.

915
01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:37.874
- I got an idea.

916
01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:43.293
You guys gonna be here
for one more night?

917
01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:44.535
- Yeah. that's the plan.

918
01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:48.229
- Tomorrow we can hit
up my boy Eddie's cabin.

919
01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:49.851
- What's that?

920
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.888
- Super. super remote cabin.

921
01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:53.613
only a couple miles
off the trail.

922
01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:58.032
My boy Eddie hits
it up for hunting.

923
01:04:58.066 --> 01:05:01.587
I mean. if he's there. he's
usually got some dope coke.

924
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:05.073
[laughs] And we could
actually use his gun. too.

925
01:05:05.108 --> 01:05:08.007
[imitates gunshot]

926
01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:12.356
I mean. if not. no
worries. it's no big deal.

927
01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:13.219
- No. I'm good.

928
01:05:14.634 --> 01:05:17.706
[Ryan laughing]

929
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:19.156

we'll head that way.

[horn blowing]

936
01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:36.933

[snow crunching]

938
01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:39.659
It's been awhile
since I've been.

939
01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:44.423
Sure you okay. Gus?

940
01:05:44.457 --> 01:05:45.562

943
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:50.084
Okay.

944
01:05:50.118 --> 01:05:54.364

- Yeah. what's up?

946
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:57.194
- The other night
when we had that tea.

01:05:57.229 --> 01:05:59.024
- Look. it's fine. man.

948
01:05:59.058 --> 01:05:59.852
I'm not worried about it.

949
01:05:59.886 --> 01:06:01.785
There's nothing there.

950
01:06:02.717 --> 01:06:04.512
Let's take a break. okay?

951
01:06:05.616 --> 01:06:06.445
Hey Ryan!

952
01:06:07.687 --> 01:06:08.516
Hold up!

958
01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:25.498
Probably not frozen
all the way through.

959
01:06:25.533 --> 01:06:26.706
- [Adam] We probably
shouldn't walk on it.

960
01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:29.502

961
01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:42.929

967
01:06:58.152 --> 01:06:59.394
- Mine.

968
01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:01.224
Gus wanted to go to
Vegas or something.

I don't think Gus can make
the trek. man. you know?

My ankle is getting worse.

1002
01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:53.059
I don't think I'm gonna
make it on this one.

1003
01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.823
- [Adam] You sure?

1004
01:08:57.857 --> 01:08:59.100

and then you come back
and get me when you can.

1012
01:09:12.355 --> 01:09:13.425
- That's not happening.

1013

1024
01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.527

I think it might
be more number two.

1033
01:10:01.266 --> 01:10:03.095
My stomach's kind of in knots.

1034
01:10:03.129 --> 01:10:04.441

01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:41.329
One reality in which
you tasted the blood

1095
01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:44.125
of your own kind
but you survived.

1096
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.714
you became stronger than
you ever thought possible.

1097
01:15:48.267 --> 01:15:50.028
Many people consume blood.

1098
01:15:50.062 --> 01:15:52.962
Tribes in Africa.
the Masai. the Surma.

1099
01:15:52.996 --> 01:15:55.205
They see it as a
life force. a power.

1100
01:15:56.448 --> 01:15:58.036
There's the other reality.

1101
01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.177
The one in which
you both die here

1102
01:16:01.211 --> 01:16:02.350
with a friend who abandoned you

1103
01:16:02.385 --> 01:16:04.283
the second he had the chance.

1104
01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:07.804
[rain falling]

1105
01:16:13.534 --> 01:16:14.742
Do it. Gus.

1106
01:16:16.192 --> 01:16:16.986
Do it.

1107
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.332
Kill it and you're free.

1108
01:16:19.264 --> 01:16:21.093
Stab the monster. escape this.

1109
01:16:21.128 --> 01:16:23.337
just like you did before.

1110
01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:25.995
Knife the creature and
the pain goes away.

1111
01:16:26.029 --> 01:16:27.617
Look deep inside yourself.

1112
01:16:27.652 --> 01:16:29.032
You know what you want to do.

1113
01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:29.861
- [Adam] Gus!

1114
01:16:29.895 --> 01:16:30.689
Gus!

1115
01:16:30.724 --> 01:16:31.621
- [Therapist] Kill it.

1116
01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:33.450
Stab your fear in the heart.

1117
01:16:33.485 --> 01:16:34.935
Kill the monster.

1118
01:16:34.969 --> 01:16:38.973
Best case scenario. you get
to be a decent human being

1119
01:16:39.008 --> 01:16:41.562
for one split second
in your miserable life

1120
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:42.908
before you die.

1121
01:16:42.943 --> 01:16:45.808
- [Gus] I'll take it. [groans]

1122
01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:48.258
[creature moaning]

1123
01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:51.020
[dramatic music]

1124
01:17:01.962 --> 01:17:03.204
[Gus gasping]

1125
01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:04.067
- Oh fuck!

1126
01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:07.174
Gus. what happened?

1127
01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:08.037
Hey?

1128
01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:10.384
[Gus moaning]

1129
01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:12.973
[Gus coughing]

1130
01:17:15.285 --> 01:17:19.013
- I killed you.

1131
01:17:19.048 --> 01:17:22.154
It was the monster.
and I killed you.

1132
01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:26.262
[groans] I buried you.

1133
01:17:27.539 --> 01:17:30.197
I killed you and then I ate you.

1134
01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:35.202
[gasping] And then we were back.

1135
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.832
- [Adam] Hey. just put
some pressure on it. okay?

1136
01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:47.386
[Gus gasping]

1137
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:56.706
- I'm not your best man.

1138
01:17:56.741 --> 01:17:57.914
- What are you talking about?

1139
01:17:57.949 --> 01:17:58.881
- I'm shitty.

1140
01:18:00.952 --> 01:18:01.780
To you.

1141
01:18:04.231 --> 01:18:09.236
To Amy. To everyone.

1142
01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:11.272
I'm sorry.

1143
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.727
- Hey. hey. hey. look at me.

1144
01:18:17.762 --> 01:18:18.624
Look at me!

1145
01:18:20.109 --> 01:18:22.456
You're my best man. okay?

1146
01:18:24.078 --> 01:18:26.736
You hear me? [breathes heavily]

1147
01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:29.566
[dramatic music]

1148
01:18:31.396 --> 01:18:32.224
Okay.

1149
01:18:35.262 --> 01:18:37.954
You're tripping
balls. man. okay?

1150
01:18:37.989 --> 01:18:38.817
Come on.

1151
01:18:39.887 --> 01:18:43.235
[Adam and Gus grunting]

1152
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.240
Okay. man.

1153
01:18:48.275 --> 01:18:50.760
[Gus gasping]

1154
01:18:52.486 --> 01:18:53.798
We gotta go.

1155
01:18:53.832 --> 01:18:55.696
We got other problems.

1156
01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:57.905
It's Ryan.

1157
01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.320
He's fucking psycho.

1158
01:19:00.252 --> 01:19:02.289
- I thought you liked him.

1159
01:19:02.323 --> 01:19:03.152
- What?

1160
01:19:04.256 --> 01:19:05.292
No.

1161
01:19:05.326 --> 01:19:06.638
I thought you liked him.

1162
01:19:06.672 --> 01:19:08.122
- Fuck no.

1163
01:19:08.157 --> 01:19:08.985
Fuck.

1164
01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:13.231
[Gus and Adam laughing]

1165
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.753
- I think there's a road
a mile that way. okay?

1166
01:19:19.824 --> 01:19:21.135
Hey. look at me.

1167
01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:24.725
We can do this.

1168
01:19:25.726 --> 01:19:26.796
Okay?

1169
01:19:26.831 --> 01:19:28.004
- Yeah.

1170
01:19:28.039 --> 01:19:31.387
- [Adam] [exhales] Let's go.

1171
01:19:31.421 --> 01:19:33.665
[Gus and Adam grunting]

1172
01:19:33.699 --> 01:19:36.426
[dramatic music]

1173
01:20:49.603 --> 01:20:50.397
[rain falling]

1174
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:51.674
- [Ryan] Come on. Adam!

1175
01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:55.022
We gotta keep going
to Eddie's cabin.

1176
01:20:55.057 --> 01:20:56.748
Adam. come on!

1177
01:20:56.782 --> 01:20:57.853
[eerie music]

1178
01:20:57.887 --> 01:20:58.784
[laughs] Come on. bud.

1179
01:20:58.819 --> 01:20:59.613
Where are you?

1180
01:21:01.787 --> 01:21:03.651
Hey!

1181
01:21:03.686 --> 01:21:06.862
[shouts] Ah. come on!

1182
01:21:22.532 --> 01:21:25.432
[grunts and gasps]

1183
01:21:26.502 --> 01:21:29.160
[intense music]

1184
01:21:56.049 --> 01:21:58.948
[Ryan screaming]

1185
01:21:58.983 --> 01:22:00.156
What the fuck!

1186
01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:20.797
Hey!

1187
01:22:21.902 --> 01:22:26.596
[speaks in foreign
language] Motherfucker!

1188
01:22:28.322 --> 01:22:30.807
[creature screeching]

1189
01:22:30.842 --> 01:22:33.327
[eerie music]

1190
01:22:39.195 --> 01:22:42.267
[creatures growling]

1191
01:23:02.425 --> 01:23:05.152
[Ryan screaming]

1192
01:23:14.851 --> 01:23:17.406
[Ryan gasping]

1193
01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:21.582
Ah. fuck.

1194
01:23:21.617 --> 01:23:24.378
[Ryan screaming]

1195
01:23:27.657 --> 01:23:30.212
[upbeat music]

1196
01:23:43.466 --> 01:23:45.986
- I'll be honest. don't love it.

1197
01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.851
- [Adam] Yeah. it's not great.

1198
01:23:48.885 --> 01:23:49.783
- No.

1199
01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:51.233
No. it's a little cheesy.

1200
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.683
Where'd you get it?

1201
01:23:53.718 --> 01:23:57.170
- I stole it. from sweet
old man named Marty.

1202
01:23:57.204 --> 01:23:58.171
- He didn't steal it.

1203
01:23:58.205 --> 01:23:59.413
- Yeah. I did steal it.

1204
01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:01.415
Thanks. cheers. yeah.

1205
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:02.278
- Yeah. cheers.

1206
01:24:05.454 --> 01:24:07.939
- [Gus] You guys can
take it down if you want.

1207
01:24:07.973 --> 01:24:09.285
- We probably will.

1208
01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.769
yeah.
- Yeah.

1209
01:24:10.804 --> 01:24:12.012
[phone ringing]

1210
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.498
- It would crush me. but
it's your guys' house.

1211
01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:17.328
- Oh. okay I think
this is the food.

1212
01:24:18.674 --> 01:24:20.745
Hi. yeah. yep.
I'll be right out.

1213
01:24:25.474 --> 01:24:28.994
- [sighs] Dude. we're
definitely going to Vegas

1214
01:24:29.029 --> 01:24:30.720
for my bachelor party.

1215
01:24:30.755 --> 01:24:32.239
[Adam snorting]

1216
01:24:32.274 --> 01:24:34.034
- [Amy] Hey Adam. can
you help me with this?

1217
01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:36.761
[bells ringing]

1218
01:24:36.795 --> 01:24:39.626
[Christmas music]

1219
01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.742
[ominous music]

1220
01:24:57.609 --> 01:24:59.818
- [Marty] And her mind
started playing tricks on her.

1221
01:24:59.853 --> 01:25:02.545
these cruel. cruel games.

1222
01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.823
- [Therapist] What do
you think happens now?

1223
01:25:04.858 --> 01:25:06.101
You are what you are.

1224
01:25:09.069 --> 01:25:12.072
Your reality is pretty
much irrelevant.

1225
01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:15.075
It's the decision.
Gus. not the outcome.

1226
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.903
[Gus coughing]

1227
01:25:15.938 --> 01:25:18.768

[Gus hissing]
