3
00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.541
- I received a call

4
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.711
about one of my friends
passing away over the weekend

5
00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.747
from not being.
like being in a pool

6
00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:27.158
and not knowing how
to swim and drowning.

7
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.094
That's literally
the story behind it.

8
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.723
Mysterex - So I
mean did you know

9
00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:35.232
any more details
regarding how he drowned?

10
00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:39.500
- I just got the bare minimum.

11
00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.238
but it's just deep.

12
00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:49.345
it's a deep thing
to think about.

13
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.813
- Oh Layla.

14
00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:00.092
It's your friend Mr. Society.

15
00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:06.560
What will all that
swimming do to your hair?

16
00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.200
What will it do to your skin?

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.335
Yeah. what the rumours say?

18
00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.766
Blacks can't swim.

19
00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:24.116

26
00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:42.662
- So how was your holiday?

27
00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:43.498
- Oh my God.

28
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.466
It was amazing.

29
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.731
We had our own private waiter.

30
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:46.875
We had our own swimming pool.

31
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.338
It was amazing.

32
00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:49.834
- Private waiter
and swimming pool?

33
00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.781
- Yeah I just rang the
bell and he came running.

34
00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.574
- Is that all you guys
talk about. holiday?

35
00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.445
There's something in life
to talk about you know.

36
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.677
- Like what?

37
00:01:57.712 --> 00:02:00.152
- Like music. car
shows. fashion.

38
00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.254
Is that Gucci?

39
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.486
- Yeah. that's a Gucci.

40
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.653
- I should have worn
my Gucci life jacket.

41
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:07.688
we could have matched.

42
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:10.426
- Talking about life jacket.

43
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.197
so how'd you get
on with swimming?

44
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:12.923
- Yeah.

45
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:13.924
So it's going quite well.

46
00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.025
It's going pretty well.

47
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.169
I was having problems with
the breathing part of it

48
00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.315
but other than that. It's
going really. really well.

49
00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.865
And I just can't believe
that it's taking me this long

50
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.637
to actually even consider
learning how to swim.

51
00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.245
So yeah. I was standing behind
them. behind the stereotype.

52
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.939
the stigmas and the myths.

53
00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:31.513
And you guys are
pretty instrumental.

54
00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:33.185
And you're one of
the triggers actually

55
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.848
in getting me into
actually learn how to swim.

56
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.291
Do you remember the last
time we had the conversation

57
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.589
and I had a life jacket on

58
00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:16.756
and you say that. if
my daughter can swim.

59
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:17.857
everyone can swim.

60
00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:19.932
And that's one of the things
that pushed me to yeah.

61
00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:22.960
Can I just. I'll take this call.

62
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.830
Sorry about this.

63
00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.305
- Wow. he's learnt to swim.

64
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.473
- Yeah.

65
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.970
Especially how we know how
difficult it was for him. right.

66
00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.478
- Oh. sorry about that.

67
00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:37.843
I had to find a quieter place.

68
00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:38.910
So yeah.

69
00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:39.746
So this is Frank

70
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:40.978
So who's speaking.

71
00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:43.387
- My name is Ettiene
from Azutan Empowerment.

72
00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:44.355
- How can I help you?

73
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.587
- I have two young people

74
00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:47.358
who have been working
with for some time.

75
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.855
They both have issues that
remind me of your story.

76
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.626
They're both
bright. intelligent.

77
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:53.925
and have the potential
to move forward in life.

78
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.400
I have recently received
funding for a project

79
00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:57.929
which includes swimming.

80
00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:00.030
But no matter what I try to do.

81
00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.538
something is holding them
back from taking part.

82
00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:05.475
I was wondering if you can
come and have a conversation

83
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.872
and chat with them.

84
00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:09.413
- Okay. yeah. I would love to.

85
00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:12.559
Well you obviously. you've
obviously had about my journey

86
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:13.813
and all that kind of thing.

87
00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:16.013
So yes. anything. any
assistance I can help.

88
00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:18.884
I can lend to anybody
else learning how to swim

89
00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.490
and there'll be.
yeah. I'd love to.

90
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.690
- Well actually that
is not the problem.

91
00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.428
They both know how to swim.

92
00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.430
- So how can I help then?

93
00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.805
- Well. I think it's
best if you come down

94
00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:29.367
and you can chat
with them further

95
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.897
and then you understand
the situation more.

96
00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:35.032
- Well. you've got my number
anyway. so text me the address

97
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:38.310
and let's schedule a
time and I'll after work.

98
00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:41.346
I'll pop around then see if
I can have a conversation

99
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.713
with them and get to the
bottom of what this issue is.

100
00:04:45.748 --> 00:04:46.879
- Okay. thank you.

101
00:04:46.914 --> 00:04:48.386
It was nice to
speak to you. Frank.

102
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.684
- Nice speaking to you.

103
00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:50.828
All right. speak to
you in a bit. cheers.

104
00:04:50.852 --> 00:04:52.390
Bye.

105
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.623
- So I hear you got a new car.

106
00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:56.955
- Yeah. it might need new tyres.

107
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.429
- How many miles
have you done it?

108
00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.089
- About 15.000.

109
00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:00.332
- 15?

110
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.058
- Yeah.

111
00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:02.059
- You've only had like what?

112
00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:03.434
- October.

113
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.469
- Wow.

114
00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.800
- Sorry about that guys.

115
00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:08.439
That was a really.
really strange call.

116
00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.376
So this guy Ettiene.
said he heard my journey.

117
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.674
my swimming journey.

118
00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:13.840
And which is strange

119
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.490
because we're just
talking about swimming.

120
00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.349
And he says. yeah.
he runs a programme

121
00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.977
for disadvantaged children.

122
00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:20.682
And one of the programmes that.

123
00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:23.454
one of the things that
you have to do is swim.

124
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.928
And he's got these
two young adults

125
00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:27.590
that just don't wanna
get in the water.

126
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:29.889
The strange thing is that
he says they can swim

127
00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:31.792
but they just don't want to.

128
00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:33.629
So I'm gonna go
see them next week.

129
00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:35.444
I'm gonna see if I can. he
wants me to mentor them.

130
00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.632
So it's

131
00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:40.024
So I'm gonna see them and
see what it's all about.

132
00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:55.079
- My mom is a very. very
strongly African-Nigerian woman.

133
00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:57.818
But we live in a
predominantly white area.

134
00:05:57.853 --> 00:06:00.887
So I went to a predominantly
white school as well.

135
00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:02.086
In primary school.

136
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.835
I was like the only
Black person in my year.

137
00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:06.596
And I didn't start off swimming.

138
00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:09.533
I didn't know how
to swim at first.

139
00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.139
but then I think it
was around year two.

140
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:13.702
So that's like around seven-ish.

141
00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:15.440
We started having
swimming lessons

142
00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:16.969
as part of the
national curriculum.

143
00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:19.477
And yeah. I wasn't able to swim.

144
00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.578
I was a lot behind.

145
00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.877
I was a lot more behind
than the rest of the group

146
00:06:23.912 --> 00:06:26.616
- When I was younger.
on my birthday as well.

147
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:28.651
I went to a swimming pool

148
00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:30.488
and like they had
the blow up slides

149
00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.687
and all of that in there.

150
00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:33.854
And I nearly drowned
in the deep end.

151
00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.021
And since that day I've
just been traumatised.

152
00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:38.155
So like. I go back in
the water and stuff like.

153
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.089
I'm not traumatised to a point

154
00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:41.895
where I don't wanna
even think about water.

155
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.094
but when I'm in there.

156
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.437
it's like my heart
is just. I'm anxious.

157
00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:46.801
I'm so anxious.

158
00:06:46.836 --> 00:06:49.166
- So last time I went
swimming was in Florida.

159
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.443
literally a year ago.

160
00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:55.007
And they went to the beach
and I didn't want to swim

161
00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:56.173
because of my hair. but

162
00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.210
- So my dad. every
year we go on holiday

163
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:04.181
and he goes snorkeling
under water in the sea.

164
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.491
And sometimes he
goes out quite far.

165
00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:10.462
but I'd only go out to
where the little fishes.

166
00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.123
I normally would go
to where they are

167
00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:15.566
but I wouldn't go
as far as he goes.

168
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.469
- No way. I can't swim.

169
00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.604
Mainly because I just.
I don't know how to

170
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.541
and I'm never really
tried in a way.

171
00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.037
Because I'll be honest.

172
00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:28.546
I wouldn't say I'm scared but.
I just don't like swimming.

173
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:29.613
It's not my thing.

174
00:07:32.013 --> 00:07:34.046
- Well. we've had
a lot of experience

175
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:35.225
and that's how we kind
of we know we can't swim.

176
00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:38.787
And this is experience from
we're talking primary school

177
00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:41.856
to all the way to even
now. shame to say.

178
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:45.497
but even now I
still can't get it.

179
00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:48.060
I guess it's the fear
in water that I have.

180
00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:49.028
I don't know about you.

181
00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:50.260
- Yeah. that's what's weird.

182
00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.306
It's not like we've
never had lessons.

183
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.572
'Cause like it was
compulsory in primary school.

184
00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.135
but even then we just.

185
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.237
I don't know if we just don't
pick it up or whatever it is.

186
00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.041
And it's not that
I don't want to.

187
00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:03.273
- Yeah.

188
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:04.419
- I'd love to be able
to go on these holidays

189
00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:07.750
and just be kicking the ball
in water doing whatever.

190
00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:09.213
- I think I was
quite determined.

191
00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:11.292
'cause I quite liked the
idea of being able to swim.

192
00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:13.723
Being able to like play in the
water when you go on holiday.

193
00:08:13.758 --> 00:08:16.187
So before I could swim. you'd
go on holiday. it's like.

194
00:08:16.222 --> 00:08:17.573
oh. I can't go
without my arm bands.

195
00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.640
You see with these other girls

196
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.862
like going in. swimming freely.

197
00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:23.128
It's like. I can't do that
because I can't swim yet.

198
00:08:23.163 --> 00:08:25.262
So I think it was that
that sort of like drive me

199
00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:27.539
to like go and learn to swim

200
00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.277
- From the beginning.
it was primary school.

201
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:30.707
We used to have
swimming lessons.

202
00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:33.776
that's where it
first started off.

203
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:36.515
When we're doing the lessons.

204
00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.254
I was the one that
couldn't swim in it.

205
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:40.110
but it was like a few of us.

206
00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:43.588
But like. you know.
we were all Black.

207
00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.689
- 'Cause I wanna learn
how to swim myself.

208
00:08:45.724 --> 00:08:48.560
Like I would love to
learn how to swim anyway.

209
00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:50.727
I've went to like in a few
dates with different girls

210
00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:51.926
and I was like. you know.

211
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:53.664
like most of them
they know how to swim

212
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.941
and I've asked them you know.
can you teach me how to swim?

213
00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:58.097
And that's the thing that shit
is like sounds funny

214
00:08:58.132 --> 00:08:59.571
but I'm serious about it.

215
00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:00.935
I wanna learn how to swim.

216
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.332
Same as all like in the summer.

217
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:05.203
you gonna learn how
to like ride a bike.

218
00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:08.338
I wanna swim as well. but
I just don't know how to.

219
00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:10.846
- In my head for some reason
I just thought I could swim.

220
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:12.650
So I just jumped in the water.

221
00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.654
not caring like
about anything else.

222
00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.521
I jumped in

223
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.063
I just went all the
way to the bottom.

224
00:09:19.087 --> 00:09:21.923
Just like. like an
unveil. like boom.

225
00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.630
And I'm just like. the
water just started going in.

226
00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.798
And I'm like taking it in.

227
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.974
And then. I think someone
could see the bubbles coming up

228
00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:30.976
or whatever. somebody jumped
in and grabbed me out bro.

229
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.364
like start pushing my chest
down like all the water

230
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.198
is coming out.

231
00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:36.278
I'm like what the
hell just happened?

232
00:09:36.302 --> 00:09:37.302
I just drowned.

233
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.143
- Yes. I've had an experience
where I thought like.

234
00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:47.047
yes. swimming needs
to be learned.

235
00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:50.952
I remember it was. I was
a lot younger in a camp.

236
00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:53.152
I went to a camp with
a few of my friends

237
00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:57.057
and they had this like total
wipe out kind of course.

238
00:09:57.092 --> 00:09:59.059
So I remember climbing
up these ladders

239
00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:02.766
and I had to slide down a slide
and then swim to the canoes

240
00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.240
and I'd remember
just sliding down.

241
00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:07.166
It was all fun and games
until I hit that water.

242
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:10.400
And I just went in and I
remember gulping so much

243
00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:12.743
cause I've never been
in water like that.

244
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:16.274
So I just remember gulping and
gulping and it was freezing.

245
00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:17.209
And you know that whole thing

246
00:10:17.244 --> 00:10:18.254
about when your body hits water

247
00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:19.387
and you're just gasping for air.

248
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.048
So it was something.
it was like.

249
00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:23.655
I remember just
gasping and struggling

250
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.052

Come on. I just need the
hook for it and it's gone.

Finish the beat fam.

274
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.310
I need finished tunes to
send to the radio fam.

275
00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:26.784
- Trust me. bro.

276
00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:27.918
Ettiene is a kind person.

277
00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.996
He promised to help me with
a couple of things though.

278
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.821
- What?

279
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:31.448
Help you with what fam?

280
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:32.922

281
00:11:32.957 --> 00:11:34.187
Allow it bro.

282
00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:35.496
- Bro. I don't even
want to swim myself.

283
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.828
but it's part of
the whole project.

284
00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.127
- Bro. just concentrate

285
00:11:40.162 --> 00:11:43.328
and we'll be back fam for

- Wait. what can

291
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.440

- Hello Simon.

305
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:44.059
It's your friend. Mr Society.

306
00:12:48.098 --> 00:12:49.559
Swimming?

307
00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:50.868
You'll drown.

308
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:54.201
We don't want that. do we?

309
00:12:56.942 --> 00:13:00.878
Listen to your friend
Mo. he knows the score.

310
00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:03.914
Blacks can't swim.

311
00:13:13.552 --> 00:13:17.994
- I was born with a condition
called tibial hemimelia.

312
00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.898
which basically around my
fibula bone. all my tibia.

313
00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.867
So one leg is shorter
than the other

314
00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.165
and I have a prosthetic leg

315
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.905
but I don't really pay
attention to none of that.

316
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.500
I just live my life normal.

317
00:13:29.535 --> 00:13:32.811
Just doing what next
man does really.

318
00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:34.846
And pretty much.

319
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:36.914
yeah there's some
things that I can do

320
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.520
and there's somethings that.
because of this I can't.

321
00:13:38.544 --> 00:13:41.545
even when I try and
push it. I can't do.

322
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.483
So swimming. I'm still
gonna try eventually.

323
00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:48.189
but it's one of them ones where.

324
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.962
it's gonna be hard 'cause
I have to use both legs.

325
00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:52.863
I'm only using one.

326
00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:55.262
- I definitely remember
trying to conform

327
00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:58.430
and trying to do my best to
catch up as fast as I could

328
00:13:58.465 --> 00:14:00.905
so that I could jump
in the deep end.

329
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.173
But I had also a deep.
almost innate fear of water.

330
00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:10.508
So when I would have to jump
in and stuff into the deep end.

331
00:14:10.543 --> 00:14:11.642
I would be the longest one.

332
00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:15.920
I'd be last because it would
take me about 20 minutes

333
00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.989
to rack up the nerve
to actually jump in

334
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:22.894
- Because I have sickle
cell anaemia myself.

335
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:26.931
I used to be so apprehensive
about getting in pools

336
00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.901
and like. yeah the way
it affects my body.

337
00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:33.498
sometimes just the
temperature of the water

338
00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:36.974
can put me completely off

339
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:40.043
or send me into what we
call a sickle cell crisis.

340
00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:43.211
That's where my body just
basically shuts down.

341
00:14:43.246 --> 00:14:45.345
And it's in pain
stations. pain stations.

342
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.017
Red alert. red alert.

343
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:51.087
So. but the majority of the
time I swim. it soothes.

344
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:57.258
Let's say. unless I
feel like it's too cold.

345
00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:58.996
And then I just
start shivering up

346
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.998
and I just like
start stiffening.

347
00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.626
like it soothes.

348
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.266
There's a soothing feeling
that comes with swimming.

349
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:08.335
- Swimming is back at the
priority list for black people

350
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.700
because I think it's just
been advertised so much

351
00:15:10.735 --> 00:15:12.570
that black people can't swim.

352
00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:16.178
So like. it's like
misleading the mind thinking

353
00:15:16.213 --> 00:15:17.410
that we can't swim.

354
00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:19.709
So I think that's
what it is like.

355
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:22.118
And then with like
all the experiences

356
00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:24.714
that they've had as well
like for example. myself.

357
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:26.056
it just leads me think.

358
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:26.957
yeah like we can't really.

359
00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.993
it's not built. we're
not built for that

360
00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.225
or something like that.

361
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.435
You look at. look
at the Olympics.

362
00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:32.603
like it's only. it's
maybe only one black guy

363
00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:34.669
I've ever seen swimming and
I was laughing when I saw it.

364
00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:36.594
I was like. dude why
are you swimming?

365
00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:39.729
That's not your thing bro.

366
00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:43.271
- I feel like the
attention span of people

367
00:15:44.538 --> 00:15:49.145
as the generations pass
it kind of diminishes.

368
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.578
So the way for older
generational could easily

369
00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:57.054
have been attracted to
and got into swimming.

370
00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:01.091
isn't the same way the younger
generation will be attracted

371
00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.489
and get into it because
there's so many other things

372
00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:05.359
for them now to focus on

373
00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:09.099
where they'll start
now thinking. feeling.

374
00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:14.071
that there's a tier list
of the essential skills.

375
00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:19.637
And then regarding what
they might personally do

376
00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:22.112
within their own lives.

377
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:25.709
they might not have it
on such a high necessity.

378
00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:27.128
- Yes. and not seeing
it as a priority.

379
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.196
I think that's a massive thing.

380
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:33.090
I think that unless you
live either live near water

381
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.686
or live on a boat that
there's no real reason

382
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:39.063
to learn how to swim and if
you're never introduced to it

383
00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.065
it's just not something
you think about.

384
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.430
And I think it's not
something people miss out on.

385
00:16:43.465 --> 00:16:44.365
And a lot of the times

386
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.640
I don't think it affects people

387
00:16:45.665 --> 00:16:48.666
unless they do or
exposed to water.

388
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:50.305
which I think that's a choice.

389
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.087
I don't think you have
to be exposed to water

390
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.143
if you don't want to.

391
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.442
- The last time I swam.

392
00:16:55.477 --> 00:16:59.149
was probably about
three four months ago.

393
00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:01.448
Tell a lie. it was actually
about six months ago.

394
00:17:01.483 --> 00:17:04.583
And it was only because me and
my partner went to like a spa

395
00:17:04.618 --> 00:17:06.618
or something and it
was a swimming pool.

396
00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:08.389
And I didn't ever
wanna go in the water

397
00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:10.303
but she she's like. ain't
you gonna go in the water?

398
00:17:10.327 --> 00:17:11.788
Ain't you gonna go in the water.

399
00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:12.689
So I went in there
for a little bit

400
00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:14.395
and I just felt like
I was gonna drown.

401
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.232
So I wasn't even in
there for too long.

402
00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:17.805
Like my swimming skills
are not really too strong.

403
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.499
as I said so.

404
00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:22.403
I was in there trying to swim
but the water is in my mouth

405
00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:24.537
and in my nose and all sorts

406
00:17:24.572 --> 00:17:26.550
- And I remember I went to
Greece one time with like

407
00:17:26.574 --> 00:17:29.773
with the team and like one
of the guys aunties was there

408
00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:32.215
and she was. I'm gonna
teach her how to swim.

409
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.689
And like. it was just
in the little part.

410
00:17:33.713 --> 00:17:37.187
and I learned how to just
do little basic things

411
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.386
and it was all fun and then.

412
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:40.487
but then like another
future instance.

413
00:17:40.522 --> 00:17:41.587
we did like kayaking.

414
00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:42.788
- Yeah.

415
00:17:42.823 --> 00:17:44.865
- And then our boat turned
over and we were in the water.

416
00:17:44.889 --> 00:17:45.721
And then in that moment.

417
00:17:45.757 --> 00:17:47.241
it's not like you
just think. oh yeah.

418
00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:49.166
this is what I did then.

419
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.401
it just. everything goes away.

420
00:17:50.433 --> 00:17:51.828
And the only thing
I think of is.

421
00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.368
I don't want to
be here right now.

422
00:17:53.403 --> 00:17:54.567
- Kinda of panic.

423
00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:56.470
- I do want to learn
'cause I want to travel.

424
00:17:56.505 --> 00:17:58.142
I wanna. again it's
something I want

425
00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:01.574
but then I don't know how
to naturalise it like.

426
00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:02.609
- Yeah.

427
00:18:03.842 --> 00:18:07.118
- It was interesting because
from the changing room.

428
00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.779
I think things are different.

429
00:18:08.814 --> 00:18:11.254
When you're Black and
you're in a situation

430
00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:13.223
with mostly White people

431
00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.489
you already know all the
ways that you're different.

432
00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:17.359
You already know the ways that.

433
00:18:17.394 --> 00:18:19.526
the things don't.
aren't the same.

434
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:22.892
And it's like even being
in the changing rooms

435
00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:25.895
and not having lotion.
coming out with your skin dry

436
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.139
or getting your hair wet

437
00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:29.251
and not wanting your
hair to get wet.

438
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:34.145
And we'd always have fun
after the swimming lesson.

439
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.510
And you know. we were allowed
to play however we wanted

440
00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:37.885
and my friends were
trying to splash

441
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.909
and I'd be like. don't
get water on my head

442
00:18:39.944 --> 00:18:44.122
when they could never
really understand that.

443
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:49.226
- So when are you
gonna get ready?

444
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:51.162
- I'm literally just
gonna do my hair.

445
00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:53.197
Maybe put a little
bit of makeup on.

446
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:54.031
Sometimes I wish I was a boy

447
00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:57.564
I could just like
roll out of bed.

448
00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:59.236
- Hell no.

449
00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.677
Speaking of boys. you
still got that buff thing

450
00:19:00.701 --> 00:19:01.832
coming around later?

451
00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:03.306
- Who. Clayton?

452
00:19:06.707 --> 00:19:08.007
Sorry girl. go on.

453
00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:13.151
- Literally gonna chill. probably
make himself that nice to eat.

454
00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:16.627
- Girl. you better make sure
that chicken seasoned good boy.

455
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:18.189
- You're a joker.

456
00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:21.357
- So what. has he seen
like your bits yet?

457
00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:23.557
- What do you mean?

458
00:19:23.592 --> 00:19:24.393
- Come on.

459
00:19:24.428 --> 00:19:25.328
Don't play innocent.

460
00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:26.560
It's been a few months still.

461
00:19:26.595 --> 00:19:29.761
you must've shown him
something at least.

462
00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:32.665
- Well. usually we have
the lights down low

463
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.569
- Still. so you gonna go to
that swimming thing then.

464
00:19:35.604 --> 00:19:38.341
Were you gonna tell that.
what's that guys name again?

465
00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:39.573
Who. Ettiene?

466
00:19:39.608 --> 00:19:42.543
- Yeah. what are you
gonna say to him?

467
00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.513
- Would you go?

468
00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:46.679
- What?

469
00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:49.319
Go for the swimming event?

470
00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.222
- Yeah. would you go?

471
00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.257
- Do you know what?

472
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:52.883
I don't care.

473
00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:53.818
I'll go if you go.

474
00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:55.853
So what. you're gonna go?

475
00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.790
- It is what it is.

476
00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.958
I'll probably just gas
him up like last time.

477
00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:05.434
- Ettiene is not gonna be happy.

478
00:20:05.469 --> 00:20:09.438
- Boy. I can't lie. I'm
gonna shout you later.

479
00:20:09.473 --> 00:20:11.902
- All right girl then laters.

480
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.973
- I do remember
being a young kid

481
00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.008
and I got an uncle Mike
is like a military uncle.

482
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:20.449
He always takes you out.

483
00:20:20.484 --> 00:20:22.319
little days out your
cousins and stuff.

484
00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.595
And like. when I wasn't
good at swimming.

485
00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.355
he's just like chuck
him in the deep end.

486
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.664
And that's how he
taught you how to swim.

487
00:20:26.688 --> 00:20:27.896
He will just chuck
you in the deep end.

488
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.887
you panic about
but you'd catch it.

489
00:20:29.922 --> 00:20:31.636
And then once you caught
it. you were like. yeah

490
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.407
I kind of learned how
to keep myself afloat.

491
00:20:33.431 --> 00:20:34.991
Doggy paddling.
doing your thing.

492
00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.333
And then that's how I basically.

493
00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.994
I learned I remember being like

494
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:39.710
that was a good way to
teach me. it was just like

495
00:20:39.734 --> 00:20:43.274
- I can recall back to probably
when I was like six. five.

496
00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:44.208
My daddy used to take me

497
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.376
and my older brother
swimming in Brixton.

498
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.543
And that kind of
built my confidence.

499
00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:50.039
And then when we
went with school.

500
00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:52.041
I was always kind
of ahead of everyone

501
00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:54.285
'cause I kind of
had that experience.

502
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.913
And then I lost touch.

503
00:20:57.653 --> 00:21:00.357
I don't know what happened.
but I just couldn't swim.

504
00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.633
And I went South
Norwood Leisure Centre.

505
00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:05.758
I remember with my
cousins and I drowned.

506
00:21:05.793 --> 00:21:07.958
And they saved me and after
that it kinda hold on.

507
00:21:07.993 --> 00:21:10.301
how did I lose
the drive to swim?

508
00:21:10.336 --> 00:21:13.436
And I went back and it
came back after some time.

509
00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:14.932
- I did swimming lessons.

510
00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:17.440
So obviously I was
in a public pool.

511
00:21:17.475 --> 00:21:19.442
like loads of other children.

512
00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:21.411
So I just. I don't know.

513
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.446
It was fun.

514
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.415
I mean. obviously like
in the first lesson

515
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.845
I was a bit scared.

516
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.825
but I guess everyone's
scared on they're first try

517
00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:31.817
but like gradually I just
found it like really fun.

518
00:21:31.852 --> 00:21:33.049
Like wanted to go

519
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.798
- So the first time I
went to a swimming pool.

520
00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:37.757
this was back in
2006. maybe seven.

521
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:41.662
So this was year three
in my primary school.

522
00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:44.093
we went to a leisure centre.

523
00:21:44.128 --> 00:21:45.798
which had a swimming pool.

524
00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:49.373
And pretty much the
first time I went in.

525
00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.067
well I run into.

526
00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:52.838
I actually jumped
into the deep end

527
00:21:52.873 --> 00:21:54.411
without knowing
it was a deep end.

528
00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.842
And this is the first time
I've ever swam in my life.

529
00:21:56.877 --> 00:21:59.548
And obviously that's a big jump.

530
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:04.553
So then I started
drowning but it was like.

531
00:22:04.588 --> 00:22:06.654
it was weird because
people were looking

532
00:22:06.689 --> 00:22:09.591
but I was at a place where
they could obviously reach out

533
00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.758
and grab me before
I went down too low.

534
00:22:11.793 --> 00:22:13.529
And I came back
up. I was confused.

535
00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:16.499
I was like. nah. it's not
like what I saw on TV.

536
00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:17.709
- When I went to
secondary school.

537
00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:19.436
I went to swimming
lessons as well again.

538
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.098
And then that's when I
learned to like start swimming

539
00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:23.539
but I still couldn't float.

540
00:22:23.574 --> 00:22:24.914
I still needed those
puddles on everything.

541
00:22:24.938 --> 00:22:26.377
So I just thought like.

542
00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:28.445
I see Black people
actually swimming

543
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.875
like in those classes in it.

544
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.756
And I was still like the
only one that couldn't swim

545
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.120
so I felt it was
just me in it so.

546
00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:34.880
- I was always that
kid in the school

547
00:22:34.915 --> 00:22:38.554
that was always at the kinda
end of the swimming class

548
00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:39.390
- 'Cause you had levels.

549
00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:40.622
- You have levels.

550
00:22:40.657 --> 00:22:41.557
- So it's like the tad
pods. the dolphins.

551
00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:42.459
the sharks and the mermaids.

552
00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:44.087
- Yeah. exactly.

553
00:22:44.122 --> 00:22:46.562
I was. I never progressed
into the dolphins.

554
00:22:46.597 --> 00:22:47.772
You have to have like
the floating thing.

555
00:22:47.796 --> 00:22:48.729
- Yeah.

556
00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:49.565
- Like that little puddle.

557
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.533
- Yeah. I was always

558
00:22:50.568 --> 00:22:51.648
maybe from five to like 10.

559
00:22:52.636 --> 00:22:54.735
I was always in
the same position.

560
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:55.934
And going into high school.

561
00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:57.474
when you go on
these school trips.

562
00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:01.170
we have to swim even
with a life jacket on.

563
00:23:01.205 --> 00:23:02.071
I still have that kind of fear

564
00:23:02.106 --> 00:23:05.174
like my feet aren't
touching the ground.

565
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:06.912
My feet aren't
touching the ground.

566
00:23:06.947 --> 00:23:07.847
I'm gonna die.

567
00:23:07.882 --> 00:23:09.079
You know what I'm saying?

568
00:23:09.114 --> 00:23:11.147
I have to. it takes me
a good 15-20 minutes

569
00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:12.555
then I'm like. okay. I'm cool.

570
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.590
I'm settled.

586
00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:00.196
How's it all funded?

587
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.901
- Thank you. we can only try.

588
00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:05.036
With such little resources.
it's difficult to get funding.

589
00:24:05.071 --> 00:24:09.139
We're relying a lot on donations
and favours but we manage.

590
00:24:09.174 --> 00:24:11.548
What we're doing now is
giving kids the opportunity

591
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.583
to get involved in
different activities

592
00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.915
over the course of three
months. which includes swimming.

593
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.017
- So how do you want me
to get involved in this?

594
00:24:19.052 --> 00:24:20.260
- Well. we used to
have a swimming event

595
00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:22.757
before Called Swim
Ting. which was good.

596
00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:24.858
but two members have
not been taking part.

597
00:24:24.893 --> 00:24:26.838
- So these are the two that
are meeting here today.

598
00:24:26.862 --> 00:24:28.532
- Yes.

599
00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:29.643
These are two teenagers who
are part of the programme.

600
00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:31.799
Layla and Simon aka K Frost.

601
00:24:31.834 --> 00:24:33.768
who likes to be referred
by it's artist name.

602
00:24:33.803 --> 00:24:34.934
- A musician.

603
00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:36.102
- Yes.

604
00:24:36.137 --> 00:24:38.212
He loves his music and Layla
loves recreation activities

605
00:24:38.236 --> 00:24:39.543
like camping and traveling.

606
00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:42.007
- So you said they
both can swim.

607
00:24:42.042 --> 00:24:43.206
- Correct.

608
00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:45.549
- So in that case.
what am I doing here?

609
00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:55.119
- Layla. I thought I
asked you to come alone.

610
00:24:55.154 --> 00:24:56.989
You know we're going
to be having a meeting.

611
00:24:57.024 --> 00:25:01.565
- We going somewhere after.
can't she just sit here?

612
00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:07.868
You gonna have to go.

613
00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.876
- I'd like to introduce
you to Layla. Frank.

614
00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:16.911
- Hi. Layla.

615
00:25:19.783 --> 00:25:22.883
- Can you put your
phone away please?

616
00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:25.314
Sorry Frank.

617
00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:27.118
It's okay. it's cool.

618
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.965
- Oh. just in time. we're
about to start the meeting.

619
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.132
Frank. this is Simon.
I mean K Frost.

620
00:25:41.167 --> 00:25:44.608
Frost this is Frank
who I told you about.

621
00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:47.578
- Hey. what time
is this finishing?

622
00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:51.648
- Please show some respect.

623
00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:53.276
You've only just got here.

624
00:25:53.311 --> 00:25:55.685
Shouldn't take longer
than half an hour.

625
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.314
So Frank has come here to
tell us about his experiences

626
00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:00.690
and how he overcame
his fears in water.

627
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.791
And hopefully through this

628
00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:05.695
we can maybe shed some light
on both of your issues.

629
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.773
- Do we need to talk about it?

630
00:26:06.797 --> 00:26:07.763
- Yes. we do.

631
00:26:07.798 --> 00:26:09.028
That's what we agreed.

632
00:26:09.063 --> 00:26:10.711
I would help you with
your goals and dreams

633
00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:12.603
and you will take
part in the programme.

634
00:26:12.638 --> 00:26:14.605
- But we're doing.
the programme.

635
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.145
- And that means
all of the programme

636
00:26:16.169 --> 00:26:17.707
and that includes swimming.

637
00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.709
So Frank is going to talk
about his experiences

638
00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.348
and then we're going
to have a conversation.

639
00:26:21.372 --> 00:26:22.613
Okay?

640
00:26:34.957 --> 00:26:36.352
- Man this heat though.

641
00:26:36.387 --> 00:26:37.586
- Mad hot today.

642
00:26:37.622 --> 00:26:39.641
I know I'm telling you. these
bugs are getting on my nerves.

643
00:26:39.665 --> 00:26:41.258
- Kinda like Jamaica

644
00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:43.260
- It's really. really
hot can be dealing.

645
00:26:43.295 --> 00:26:46.901
Really hard at the same time.
I need to get my hair done.

646
00:26:46.936 --> 00:26:47.836
- Word.

647
00:26:47.871 --> 00:26:48.804
What are you trynna do with it?

648
00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:50.740
- I have no clue.

649
00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.368
I need help.

650
00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:54.139
No clue whatsoever.

651
00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:57.109
- You trynna do.
front or leave out.

652
00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:00.948
- I was thinking
like a box braids.

653
00:27:00.983 --> 00:27:01.784
- Box braids.

654
00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:03.148
- Box braids.

655
00:27:03.183 --> 00:27:04.765
I'm telling you it's
probably be box braids.

656
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.316
Having it up in one.

657
00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:09.253
Feel the wind going
through if we get any wind.

658
00:27:09.288 --> 00:27:11.662
Like have you decided what
you're gonna do with your hair?

659
00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:13.697
- I think. I'm thinking
of getting it twisted

660
00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:16.062
or I'm not sure if I should
just do straight locs.

661
00:27:16.097 --> 00:27:18.669
- Why. you on on some thing
with 'em locs boy?

662
00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:19.868
- No.

663
00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:21.078
You know what it is that
I really wanna do it

664
00:27:21.102 --> 00:27:23.333
but it's just a
process. it's just long.

665
00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:25.049
- Why. is it hard to
maintain or something?

666
00:27:25.073 --> 00:27:25.973
- Yeah. definitely.

667
00:27:26.008 --> 00:27:27.238
You have to always get it done

668
00:27:27.273 --> 00:27:29.405
or make sure that
it don't get wet.

669
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.682
- No that's just long.

670
00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:34.146
So what was the
meeting about then?

671
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:36.819
- Just some Frank guy
talking about how he overcome

672
00:27:36.854 --> 00:27:38.315
his fear of swimming.

673
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.196
- So what. is he trying
to teach you how to swim?

674
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.692
That's long.

675
00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:42.693
- I know. right?

676
00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:44.695
- I don't see what's so
special about swimming.

677
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.026
He needs allow it.

678
00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:48.424
And I just told you
about my hair and ting.

679
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:51.262
- Damn. did you tell
him about the ting?

680
00:27:51.297 --> 00:27:52.197
- No.

681
00:27:52.232 --> 00:27:53.803
That's none of his business.

682
00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.079
- So I don't think
Etienne is gonna be happy

683
00:27:55.103 --> 00:27:56.839
if you miss the
swimming workshop again.

684
00:27:56.874 --> 00:27:58.467
- I know. but we
come to an agreement

685
00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:00.942
that I'll speak to
Frank over the phone.

686
00:28:00.977 --> 00:28:03.813
but I got my own plans.

687
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:04.848
- I hear you.

688
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.413
- Issues regarding. hair.
and what not for swimming

689
00:28:13.451 --> 00:28:15.891
is rife amongst our community.

690
00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:17.200
- Because I asked my
friend if we'd go swimming

691
00:28:17.224 --> 00:28:18.454
a couple weeks ago.

692
00:28:18.489 --> 00:28:19.499
And she was like.
hell no. my hair.

693
00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:20.962
I don't want it to get wet.

694
00:28:20.997 --> 00:28:23.096
It's long to maintain.

695
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:25.164
- Well. I used to wear
swimming cap in school.

696
00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:27.496
Like the school swimming
lessons that was compulsory.

697
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:28.664
That's why a swimming cap.

698
00:28:28.699 --> 00:28:31.874
Then after a while it was
like your hair still gets wet.

699
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:33.337
it doesn't really do much.

700
00:28:33.372 --> 00:28:35.977
But then the private
swimming lessons.

701
00:28:36.012 --> 00:28:37.473
I wasn't wearing swimming cap.

702
00:28:37.508 --> 00:28:40.278
You just had to wash your
hair like straight afterwards.

703
00:28:40.313 --> 00:28:42.346
Make sure you bring
your products with you.

704
00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:43.820
And yeah

705
00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.382
- I used to have
like short hair.

706
00:28:45.417 --> 00:28:47.252
So it would've been
just combing it.

707
00:28:47.287 --> 00:28:48.386
Like you just wash it.

708
00:28:48.422 --> 00:28:50.761
Like. it just it's like just
coming out of the shower.

709
00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:51.907
It's just normal for us in it.

710
00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:54.765
But yeah. it's a whole lot
different for Black women.

711
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.163
But like say if I had
hair like this now.

712
00:28:57.198 --> 00:29:00.397
like and I went to go swim.
I wouldn't be able to do it.

713
00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:01.838
Cause they would
mess up my hair.

714
00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:02.839
Like spent time just doing it.

715
00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.204
Like the Mumsy. did it
for me and everything.

716
00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:08.207
So I can't let it like.
just like after all that.

717
00:29:08.242 --> 00:29:10.242
keep on redoing it all the time.

718
00:29:10.277 --> 00:29:12.310
- Black girls with braids.
you can't get them wet.

719
00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:15.214
So they wouldn't
go in the water.

720
00:29:15.249 --> 00:29:16.996
Their hair wouldn't fit
in the swimming hat.

721
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.822
So they weren't allowed
to go in the water

722
00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:20.087
without swimming hat.

723
00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:21.561
But I've never
really seen an issue.

724
00:29:21.585 --> 00:29:22.518
I've never had a personal issue.

725
00:29:22.553 --> 00:29:25.224
but I do know a few Black girls

726
00:29:25.259 --> 00:29:27.193
that couldn't have
their hair in braids

727
00:29:27.228 --> 00:29:29.866
because they had to go. they
had to do swimming lessons.

728
00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.396
which I don't know if
that's a bad thing or not

729
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:35.267
because you know. if it's
part of the school curriculum.

730
00:29:35.302 --> 00:29:37.841
it's something you've got to do.

731
00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:40.107
But I do understand
why it'd be annoying

732
00:29:40.142 --> 00:29:42.186
to not have your hair. like
be able to have your hair

733
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.913
how you want to have it.

734
00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:46.377
- I would say with swimming
and my hair probably my mom.

735
00:29:46.412 --> 00:29:48.247
she'd always tell me.
don't get your hair wet

736
00:29:48.282 --> 00:29:49.512
when you go swimming.

737
00:29:49.547 --> 00:29:51.162
But I feel like it was
inevitable actually.

738
00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:52.350
I would try everything.

739
00:29:52.385 --> 00:29:54.891
Every single cap. my
hair will still get wet.

740
00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.299
I feel like it was the
effects of the chlorine

741
00:29:56.323 --> 00:29:58.092
in like natural hair.

742
00:29:58.127 --> 00:30:01.161
Well I just liked swimming
so much. I will still swim.

743
00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:02.470
- The whole process
of drying it. yeah.

744
00:30:02.494 --> 00:30:03.900
- Yeah.

745
00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.209
- But I feel like that
can also be used to.

746
00:30:05.233 --> 00:30:07.871
I use that as an excuse a lot.

747
00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:08.597
That was gonna go like.

748
00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:10.005
ah. guys I'll sit this one out.

749
00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.436
my hair I don't want
it to get too wet.

750
00:30:12.471 --> 00:30:14.471
And then yeah. the
whole process but.

751
00:30:14.506 --> 00:30:15.615
- To moisturise
it has to come up.

752
00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:17.045
- Yeah I have to moisturise

753
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.288
- And white people
don't get that.

754
00:30:18.312 --> 00:30:19.894
They think you just dip
in and then you leave.

755
00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:22.248
They don't know we have a
whole half an hour there.

756
00:30:22.283 --> 00:30:24.558
Itching inside. getting the
sand out of you and all of that.

757
00:30:24.582 --> 00:30:25.648
- Definitely.

758
00:30:25.683 --> 00:30:28.551
- I guess for me an advantage
is I come from Eritrea.

759
00:30:28.586 --> 00:30:31.422
my hair texture is a bit different.
although I am African.

760
00:30:31.457 --> 00:30:32.962
It's a lot more
easy to maintain.

761
00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.172
So for me. it's that
it's not a big deal.

762
00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:35.129
I'll go ahead and wash it.

763
00:30:35.164 --> 00:30:36.900
But for some other people.

764
00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:39.265
their hair texture might be
very hard for them to control.

765
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.882
So it's like is me
swimming in the pool

766
00:30:40.906 --> 00:30:44.534
for an hour worth of stress
I have to go through?

767
00:30:44.569 --> 00:30:46.910
- You really have to
want to go to swim

768
00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:48.879
if you're willing to
go through all of that.

769
00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:52.883
And I don't think most
people are into the idea.

770
00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:09.394
- Yow Sayso. mans on the
way back to the studio bro.

771
00:31:09.429 --> 00:31:11.044
This swimming thing
is just so long bro.

772
00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:12.639
Just to let you know
I'm really serious

773
00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:13.629
about this music thing.

774
00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:15.433
Forget that swimming thing bro.

775
00:31:15.468 --> 00:31:18.942
- Fam. why'd you keep complaining. just
do the thing. bro.

776
00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.504
- Why do I need swimming bro?

777
00:31:20.539 --> 00:31:22.440
For real. why do
I need swimming?

778
00:31:22.475 --> 00:31:24.915
- You got to look at it
in that positive way fam.

779
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.609
Stop looking in
the other way fam.

780
00:31:26.644 --> 00:31:27.951
Can you swim?

781
00:31:30.417 --> 00:31:32.615
- I'm not
gonna lie to you fam but

782
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.783
A bit.
- A bit.

783
00:31:33.818 --> 00:31:36.003
- I don't believe you. but
anyway. it's a life skill in it.

784
00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.488
So make sure you get that done

785
00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:39.688
before you worry
about the music.

786
00:31:39.723 --> 00:31:40.524
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

787
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.965
I hear you. I hear you.

788
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.592
I'll link you back
in the studio though.

789
00:31:42.627 --> 00:31:44.000
my bus is about to come

790
00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:44.968
I'll leave you
back in the studio.

791
00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.003
- Cool.

792
00:31:59.347 --> 00:32:00.643
- Last year or two years ago.

793
00:32:00.678 --> 00:32:04.284
I was having a
conversation with my aunt

794
00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:07.551
and she was saying how there
are areas in Nigeria in Lagos

795
00:32:07.586 --> 00:32:11.555
where kids swim. it's
water-based country

796
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.460
and well not country but
certain parts of the land.

797
00:32:15.495 --> 00:32:17.429
You've got a lot of water
and the kids will swim

798
00:32:17.464 --> 00:32:19.068
from a young age.

799
00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:22.599
And I think part of the
problem is we never see that.

800
00:32:22.634 --> 00:32:25.503
We don't really know that
Black kids can grow up

801
00:32:25.538 --> 00:32:27.076
and water rule their life.

802
00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.583
It's almost this thing
that we're introduced

803
00:32:28.607 --> 00:32:32.510
to a certain age and
its like. trust issues.

804
00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:34.710
- I don't know any like
role models that swim

805
00:32:34.745 --> 00:32:36.382
and that's the thing as well.

806
00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:39.319
If there was role models for
black people. it will be there.

807
00:32:39.354 --> 00:32:40.991
Once again. like basketball.

808
00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:42.729
we've got the likes of
the Jordan. Kobe. Lebron.

809
00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:45.589
Football. Pele.
players like Pogba

810
00:32:45.624 --> 00:32:48.262
and swimming there's no one. so.

811
00:32:50.431 --> 00:32:52.101
- I feel like there's
a lot of things

812
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:55.401
that could make swimming more
relatable to Black people.

813
00:32:55.436 --> 00:32:57.106
especially in the market.

814
00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:01.011
You're talking about. see like
for us basketball. football.

815
00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:03.772
These are things that we can
do literally in our gardens.

816
00:33:03.807 --> 00:33:05.521
out on the street you
know what I'm saying?

817
00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:08.183
So I feel like.
especially in the UK.

818
00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.614
you've got so many things
like forgetting sport.

819
00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:14.321
you've got music and stuff that
a lot of black youth go to.

820
00:33:14.356 --> 00:33:17.093
After school we're doing
this. not many say swimming.

821
00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:20.459
I feel like. even just
an adverts and stuff

822
00:33:20.494 --> 00:33:23.165
like I feel like they
could be using more kind of

823
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.662
like Black models to.

824
00:33:25.697 --> 00:33:27.499
Yeah. yeah so like.
when you're a kid.

825
00:33:27.534 --> 00:33:28.808
you look up to
that person and go.

826
00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:30.370
oh. there's a Black
person swimming.

827
00:33:30.405 --> 00:33:31.734
I wanna do that too.

828
00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:32.669
- It's crazy.

829
00:33:32.704 --> 00:33:34.110
It's all about influence.

830
00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:35.156
Like you'll actually
be surprised.

831
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.311
If one of the biggest
rappers in the UK right now

832
00:33:37.346 --> 00:33:38.774
said this. sorry.

833
00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:42.811
But you know. I wanna
do a big swimming.

834
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:45.418
he's gonna have the audience
follow him. do you get it?

835
00:33:45.453 --> 00:33:47.156
- Just like more.

836
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:49.719
like a better representation
of Black swimmers.

837
00:33:49.754 --> 00:33:52.458
Like I've never heard of
the lady in the Olympics

838
00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:54.097
that's gonna compete next year.

839
00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:54.964
I've never heard of her.

840
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.266
But knowing that she
is a Black person

841
00:33:58.301 --> 00:34:00.532
that's going to be
competing in the Olympics.

842
00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:03.139
I can just imagine kids
will be seeing that.

843
00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:05.801
And they will see
themselves in her.

844
00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:09.145
So that will inspire them
to get into the whole.

845
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.740
the sports of it all.

846
00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.520
- I can't believe Frank. you
got that stupid life jacket

847
00:34:21.555 --> 00:34:23.192
and learned how to swim.

848
00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:25.821
- But we were walking down
the streets. look like a prat.

849
00:34:25.856 --> 00:34:29.099
It got to a point
whereby I couldn't do it.

850
00:34:29.134 --> 00:34:31.134
I just had to. I just
had to give it up

851
00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:34.104
and actually learn how to swim.

852
00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.336
Yeah.

853
00:34:35.371 --> 00:34:36.777
It's a shame it took
me so long though.

854
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:38.702
- And even though he
suffered from aquaphobia.

855
00:34:38.737 --> 00:34:41.177
he still buy a
house by the river.

856
00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.310
- That's how we roll.

857
00:34:42.345 --> 00:34:44.114
This is how we roll.

858
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.149
Yeah.

859
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.217
I saw the house. liked it.

860
00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:52.749
Even think about the whole
issue of the river and yeah.

861
00:34:52.784 --> 00:34:53.860
But it's never been a problem.

862
00:34:53.884 --> 00:34:54.784
So that's cool.

863
00:34:54.819 --> 00:34:56.192
But you can swim. can you?

864
00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:58.128
- No. I just didn't
bother to learn.

865
00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:00.361
I had a bad experience
when I was younger.

866
00:35:00.396 --> 00:35:03.331
Went to the pool with the
boys and like it is here now.

867
00:35:03.366 --> 00:35:04.827
everyone jumped in.

868
00:35:04.862 --> 00:35:08.171
I jumped in as well. went
straight to the bottom.

869
00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.502
Managed to climb myself back up

870
00:35:09.537 --> 00:35:10.547
and I thought. you know what?

871
00:35:10.571 --> 00:35:12.142
This is not for me.

872
00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:13.506
Changed my clothes and I went.

873
00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:15.178
- Would you learn?

874
00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.586
- Yeah. now that I
see what you're doing.

875
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.181
you might entice me to learn.

876
00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.216
- Cool. cool.

877
00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:24.649
So I've actually created a word
called the "Bl-aquaphobia".

878
00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:25.584
- Wow.

879
00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:26.915
Is that even a word Frank?

880
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.653
- I thought that word
originally existed

881
00:35:28.688 --> 00:35:30.292
but I checked on
Google to everywhere.

882
00:35:30.327 --> 00:35:33.262
There's nothing such as.
so I created the word.

883
00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:36.199
bla-aquaphobia. as
in B L as in black.

884
00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.662
then aquaphobia add to it.

885
00:35:37.697 --> 00:35:39.796
- Well. Wikipedia here I come.

886
00:35:41.932 --> 00:35:44.207
I would patent
that if I were you?

887
00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.505
- I have. I have.

888
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.837
- Do you actually
get in the river?

889
00:35:47.872 --> 00:35:48.805
- I've been there
a couple of times.

890
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.906
When I first moved in here.

891
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:54.283
the neighbours came around and
said we're cleaning the river.

892
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.549
So do you wanna join us all?

893
00:35:56.584 --> 00:35:57.484
Yeah.

894
00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:58.719
But it's not that deep anyway.

895
00:35:58.751 --> 00:35:59.828
Still only just
up to about here.

896
00:35:59.852 --> 00:36:03.358
- Looks great actually
guys. should we dive in now?

897
00:36:03.393 --> 00:36:04.753
- Hell no. you've
got to be joking.

898
00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.197
- Frank what's the
trigger for you

899
00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:09.738
to learn how to swim
at the first place?

900
00:36:09.762 --> 00:36:11.498
- My daughter.

901
00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:13.213
It got to a point
whereby I said to myself

902
00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:15.601
that if she ever was
in difficulty in water.

903
00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:18.604
here. on holiday or anyway.
and I couldn't help her.

904
00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:20.353
I don't think I would
ever forgive myself.

905
00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:21.937
So as a responsible parent.

906
00:36:21.972 --> 00:36:22.982
I thought the best thing to do

907
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.709
is actually learn how to swim.

908
00:36:24.744 --> 00:36:26.810
- Yes. that's probably
wise actually Frank.

909
00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:30.220
- It's the least I can
do that as a parent.

910
00:36:30.255 --> 00:36:33.619
I've been even asked to
mentor these two kids.

911
00:36:33.654 --> 00:36:35.357
well young adults.

912
00:36:36.756 --> 00:36:38.327
But I probably
difficulty with them

913
00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:41.264
because it's really strange

914
00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.474
because they don't wanna swim.

915
00:36:42.498 --> 00:36:43.607
they don't wanna
get into the water.

916
00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:46.302
And part of the
programme that they are.

917
00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:47.403
this is under.

918
00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.349
means that they have to
actually learn how to swim

919
00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.834
or actually swim.

920
00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:52.385
But they can swim but
they just don't wanna

921
00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:53.936
get into the water.

922
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:55.082
And I find that very strange.

923
00:36:55.106 --> 00:36:57.742
Every time I asked them.
the young lady in particular

924
00:36:57.777 --> 00:36:59.612
she says it's private.

925
00:36:59.647 --> 00:37:01.680
So I don't understand why

926
00:37:01.715 --> 00:37:04.650
but I'm sure at some
point I'll find out.

927
00:37:04.685 --> 00:37:06.322
- Amazing Frank.

928
00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.291
I'm quite actually amazed.

929
00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.158
You've gone from a aquaphobic

930
00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:12.328
to mentoring teenagers
on how to swim.

931
00:37:13.562 --> 00:37:15.375
- Well. I'm the perfect
person to do such a thing

932
00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.543
because obviously
I couldn't swim.

933
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:20.336
So they. I was hoping that
they could relate to me more

934
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.833
because I was in their
situation a few years back.

935
00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:24.538
- I am also sure Frank.

936
00:37:24.573 --> 00:37:27.805
with teenagers nowadays
they aren't that easy.

937
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.004
- I know. I know.

938
00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:30.183
It's a bit of a
challenge. but hey.

939
00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:33.943
- So they can't swim or they
don't wanna go to the pool?

940
00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:35.351
- And that's the thing.

941
00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.452
They say. the guy
who's mentoring them.

942
00:37:37.487 --> 00:37:39.322
whose running the
programme says.

943
00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:42.325
they can swim but they
just don't want to.

944
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.953
And that's the thing
I just don't get.

945
00:37:43.988 --> 00:37:45.394
I just don't get it.

946
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.495
Yeah.

947
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.268
I just. I really don't
understand. I just don't get.

948
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:52.830
- The reason. the biggest reason

949
00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:53.974
why I haven't continued to swim

950
00:37:53.998 --> 00:37:55.932
is because it's just not

951
00:37:55.967 --> 00:37:57.681
is like no one around
me wants to go swim.

952
00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:00.310
So it's just not. it's just
not an interest to be honest.

953
00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:01.553
It's just really
not an interest.

954
00:38:01.577 --> 00:38:03.973
And not a lot of family
members go swimming.

955
00:38:04.008 --> 00:38:05.755
Like it's never been a
feeling when my mom's like.

956
00:38:05.779 --> 00:38:07.383
look we're going swimming today.

957
00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.549
Or my dad's like.

958
00:38:08.584 --> 00:38:09.352
look you going swimming
with your cousins

959
00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:10.551
or something like that.

960
00:38:10.586 --> 00:38:13.719
So it's just never been
an interest really.

961
00:38:13.754 --> 00:38:15.391
- It's like nine to five.

962
00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:18.988
like road man don't find nine
to five appealing at all.

963
00:38:19.023 --> 00:38:20.924
But yeah. you would
do what you do.

964
00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:22.439
And one day you
might not make money

965
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.663
and the next day you might.

966
00:38:23.698 --> 00:38:24.906
but it's like. would you
want to take that risk

967
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.029
or would you rather not
work every single day.

968
00:38:27.064 --> 00:38:28.349
when you're gonna
get a pay slip.

969
00:38:28.373 --> 00:38:29.834
but then but it's the mindset

970
00:38:29.869 --> 00:38:31.715
is I don't wanna be looked as
someone that's in a uniform

971
00:38:31.739 --> 00:38:33.068
in a Sainsbury's uniform or.

972
00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:34.443
Do you know what I mean.

973
00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:35.686
that's not the
person that I keep.

974
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.676
And I think that's
where it goes wrong.

975
00:38:36.711 --> 00:38:37.611
There's a lot of black people

976
00:38:37.646 --> 00:38:39.448
that might actually want to swim

977
00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.383
but because there's no one else

978
00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.451
that actually does it with them.

979
00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:43.386
what's the point?

980
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.554
We don't wanna swim alone.

981
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:45.597
that's not something you wanna
do. you know what I mean.

982
00:38:45.621 --> 00:38:46.521
- I don't know if it's

983
00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:47.796
but maybe it's even historical.

984
00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.392
When you read the things that.

985
00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:52.593
you know the Black
people in the slave boats

986
00:38:52.628 --> 00:38:54.067
and they jumped off
the sides and all that.

987
00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:55.157
and they all drowned.

988
00:38:55.192 --> 00:38:57.895
I mean. just Black people
being an enemy of water

989
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.700
because it was over the
waters we were transferred.

990
00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:04.638
It's was like. minorities
and like immigration crisis.

991
00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:06.871
going on these boats and
you hear the terrible things

992
00:39:06.906 --> 00:39:08.972
that happen where. on the water.

993
00:39:09.007 --> 00:39:10.380
- It's all water.

994
00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:11.247
- And so maybe it's
little things like this

995
00:39:11.283 --> 00:39:13.548
that you see in the
media and that like

996
00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:15.495
that just get passed around
on the internet and stuff

997
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:18.421
that it's just building
up this thing of. yeah.

998
00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.148
That's not where we belong.

999
00:39:20.183 --> 00:39:23.624
- I think people. we always
make jokes and we make remarks.

1000
00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:27.991
And to some extent. I'm definitely not
one of those people

1001
00:39:28.026 --> 00:39:31.500
but I have seen Black people
make fun of other Black people

1002
00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:32.699
for not being able to swim

1003
00:39:32.734 --> 00:39:34.129
and making it seem
like something

1004
00:39:34.164 --> 00:39:35.768
they should be ashamed about

1005
00:39:35.803 --> 00:39:40.410
but that doesn't create an
environment where we can learn.

1006
00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.139
Simon. Simon. Simon.

1007
00:39:44.174 --> 00:39:46.614
What are we to do with you?

1008
00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:52.488
Black swimming?

1009
00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.688
What a load of codswallop.

1010
00:39:56.219 --> 00:39:58.758
Don't waste your time.

1011
00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:01.123
Don't waste your time Simon.

1012
00:40:17.977 --> 00:40:21.946
- Every time I'm coming
to see you right.

1013
00:40:21.981 --> 00:40:23.552
It's a process.

1014
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:27.083
I have to go into my
wardrobe and find something

1015
00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:29.921
'cause I know that you're one
of the best dressed people

1016
00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:32.924
in West London and you
always out shine me.

1017
00:40:32.959 --> 00:40:34.827
So I'll always have
to go to my wardrobe

1018
00:40:34.862 --> 00:40:36.191
and try and find something

1019
00:40:36.226 --> 00:40:39.535
that will not make
me look not too good.

1020
00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:46.542
I put this jacket on and you
don't even have your jacket on.

1021
00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.017
- I was almost tempted
to put on a fancy one

1022
00:40:49.041 --> 00:40:50.546
then I thought no. no. no.

1023
00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.778
I'll ease you up this time.

1024
00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:55.980
- So how's things anyway?

1025
00:40:56.015 --> 00:40:57.114
- Just steady. just steady.

1026
00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.721
trying to cope with this
little. the little knockdown.

1027
00:41:00.756 --> 00:41:03.218
Getting myself prepared for
when it opens up a little bit.

1028
00:41:03.253 --> 00:41:05.957
things are going fine.

1029
00:41:05.992 --> 00:41:06.892
- The book.

1030
00:41:06.927 --> 00:41:08.564
What's happening in the book?

1031
00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:09.398
- Well its going well.

1032
00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:12.799
The adventures of
Professor Splash

1033
00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:14.933
or "The Swimming
Lesson" which is.

1034
00:41:14.968 --> 00:41:15.868
It's going well.

1035
00:41:15.903 --> 00:41:17.034
I'm working on a character.

1036
00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:19.201
which is Rose Marolda.
swimming teacher

1037
00:41:19.236 --> 00:41:20.102
that shouts and screams

1038
00:41:20.137 --> 00:41:23.777
and Professors Splash.
sings and dance.

1039
00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:26.879
- This is gonna be big you know.

1040
00:41:26.914 --> 00:41:28.210
because people have waited

1041
00:41:28.245 --> 00:41:29.915
for something since
"Rasta Mouse".

1042
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.521
- I've revisited it.

1043
00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:34.623
And my plan and my
thoughts are to get it out

1044
00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:38.055
at some point by let's
just say March 2021.

1045
00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:41.564
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1046
00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.225
Talking about swimming.

1047
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.535
I've been mentoring
these two kids.

1048
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.834
I wouldn't say kids.
but young adults.

1049
00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:48.802
And part of the
programme that they're on

1050
00:41:48.837 --> 00:41:49.957
says that they have to swim.

1051
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.150
And they just don't
to get in the water.

1052
00:41:56.174 --> 00:41:58.108
They just try any excuse.

1053
00:41:58.143 --> 00:42:01.309
I thought I was a
master of excuses

1054
00:42:01.344 --> 00:42:03.278
before I started
learning how to swim

1055
00:42:03.313 --> 00:42:05.885
but that's how. they top me.

1056
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.293
They did just not wanna
get into the water

1057
00:42:07.317 --> 00:42:10.318
and I just don't
know what to do.

1058
00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:13.024
But you been doing
this for years.

1059
00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:14.597
You've been teaching for years.

1060
00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:15.829
Do you have any tips?

1061
00:42:15.864 --> 00:42:17.930
- The way I would
look at it is that.

1062
00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:19.701
motivation it's
like anything else.

1063
00:42:19.736 --> 00:42:22.264
You have to find
a way to motivate.

1064
00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:23.398
If they say that could swim

1065
00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:26.906
well. then you'd say. well.
let me see what you can do.

1066
00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:29.678
Let me see exactly what
you can do in the water.

1067
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:32.747
So you just go and
because in actual fact.

1068
00:42:32.782 --> 00:42:34.617
I dunno what
interest they've got

1069
00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:38.555
but you could transfer
any interest into water.

1070
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.689
- Yeah.

1071
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.965
- Always. always have we
need to deal with things

1072
00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:43.186
and do with swimming.

1073
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:46.926
Always have it is a
motivational incentive

1074
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:49.665
because in actual fact.
no matter what they do

1075
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.668
they do think don't
always benefit.

1076
00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.637
There's no payback or such.

1077
00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.001
There's only benefit.

1078
00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:58.300
So it's a world where
you can be in that water

1079
00:42:58.335 --> 00:43:01.974
you can be free. is
really. really liberating.

1080
00:43:02.009 --> 00:43:05.241
And especially with
a young imagination.

1081
00:43:05.276 --> 00:43:08.376
it's amazing what you can
get out of them really.

1082
00:43:08.411 --> 00:43:10.048
- Oh yeah.

1083
00:43:10.083 --> 00:43:13.150
- So I think if you could
encourage them into the water.

1084
00:43:13.185 --> 00:43:14.318
they'll benefit.

1085
00:43:14.353 --> 00:43:16.395
- I'll definitely try and
I'll speak to them about that.

1086
00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:19.321
So trying to use some
kind of incentive.

1087
00:43:19.356 --> 00:43:20.422
I don't wanna say bribery.

1088
00:43:20.457 --> 00:43:22.896
I guess incentivize them
into. get into the water.

1089
00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:24.293
- And when you do get them in.

1090
00:43:24.328 --> 00:43:26.702
Then you give them something
that's gonna excite

1091
00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:29.870
and that's gonna stimulate
them. motivate them.

1092
00:43:29.905 --> 00:43:31.872
But say. look. anyone
could say they could swim

1093
00:43:31.907 --> 00:43:34.743
but the proof of the
pudding. get in the river.

1094
00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:35.909
- Yeah.

1095
00:43:35.944 --> 00:43:38.681
Children are.
they're challenging.

1096
00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:49.791
- It's difficult because
as earlier mentioned

1097
00:43:49.826 --> 00:43:53.696
we've got things like
football. basketball.

1098
00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.291
American football.
all these sports

1099
00:43:55.326 --> 00:43:57.964
where it's more
endurance spaced.

1100
00:43:57.999 --> 00:43:59.405
Well. swimming is
an endurance sport

1101
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:01.363
but Black people.

1102
00:44:01.398 --> 00:44:05.334
we don't tend to swim
like competitive as well.

1103
00:44:05.369 --> 00:44:08.777
And if people want to
pursue stuff like that

1104
00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:11.109
if a Black person wants to
pursue a swimming career

1105
00:44:11.144 --> 00:44:14.409
they can. it's just how
many of them are there

1106
00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:16.818
to actually say they're
willing to do that.

1107
00:44:16.853 --> 00:44:19.381
to learn and to
actually go out there

1108
00:44:19.416 --> 00:44:21.757
and do it and chase
a career in it.

1109
00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:22.903
- Yes. I definitely feel like

1110
00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:25.926
if there was like more
advertisement towards swimming

1111
00:44:25.961 --> 00:44:27.004
and like Black people swimming

1112
00:44:27.028 --> 00:44:28.203
and that people would do it more

1113
00:44:28.227 --> 00:44:30.227
and it would be
like an enforcement.

1114
00:44:30.262 --> 00:44:31.339
So yeah. for like
a really important.

1115
00:44:31.363 --> 00:44:34.737
I feel like they should
be advertising on swimming

1116
00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:37.069
so that we see and watching
inclined to want to do it.

1117
00:44:37.104 --> 00:44:38.367
Because you don't see it.

1118
00:44:38.402 --> 00:44:39.819
it's not something
you worry about.

1119
00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:40.987
We worry about or feel
like at some point.

1120
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.888
- Yeah. I think it is like
the same thing like football.

1121
00:44:42.912 --> 00:44:44.373
but like football.

1122
00:44:44.408 --> 00:44:47.112
everyone like wants to do
it from like straight up

1123
00:44:47.147 --> 00:44:49.422
when you're in school. like
when you're going to activities.

1124
00:44:49.446 --> 00:44:51.886
you always wanna play football.
kickball and all of that.

1125
00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:55.153
It's like. that's
what England is like.

1126
00:44:55.188 --> 00:44:56.495
Us British people
are like. known for.

1127
00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:59.487
So like. it's a bit
different for like.

1128
00:44:59.522 --> 00:45:00.588
when it comes to swimming.

1129
00:45:00.623 --> 00:45:03.128
'cause like not everyone
wants to just go and swim.

1130
00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:05.460
Like it's like. it's
a good activity.

1131
00:45:05.495 --> 00:45:07.132
Like it's good for
like burning fat.

1132
00:45:07.167 --> 00:45:08.969
like losing weight
and all of that.

1133
00:45:09.004 --> 00:45:12.170
But like I just don't
see people like wanting

1134
00:45:12.205 --> 00:45:13.171
to take part in it.

1135
00:45:13.206 --> 00:45:15.404
- And the way to maybe do it

1136
00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:17.010
is just to make
it look more cool

1137
00:45:17.045 --> 00:45:18.946
and more advertising
to young people.

1138
00:45:18.981 --> 00:45:21.817
And even not just promoting
it but installing it

1139
00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.786
into like our curriculum.

1140
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.392
So I was lucky enough
to go to a school

1141
00:45:25.416 --> 00:45:26.888
that a primary school.

1142
00:45:26.923 --> 00:45:28.329
that brought us to
a swimming pool.

1143
00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:29.759
But even secondary schools now.

1144
00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:31.860
are they bringing people
to learn how to swim?

1145
00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:33.829
'Cause as I just said.
it's a life skill.

1146
00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:36.832
- You see like. I don't
know. Michael Phelps.

1147
00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.097
like. I don't know that.

1148
00:45:38.132 --> 00:45:41.166
I don't know any Black
freaking swimmer.

1149
00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:42.398
You see what I mean?

1150
00:45:42.433 --> 00:45:44.070
So you need one of them

1151
00:45:44.105 --> 00:45:47.073
like to be like a high level
and then adverts and stuff

1152
00:45:47.108 --> 00:45:48.272
so kids can see it.

1153
00:45:48.307 --> 00:45:49.878
- Maybe it's one of them ones

1154
00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.090
where we just leave one
superstar on the sport as well.

1155
00:45:51.114 --> 00:45:55.246
Maybe we need like the Usain
Bolt of the track. in the pool.

1156
00:45:55.281 --> 00:45:56.478
You know what I mean?

1157
00:45:56.513 --> 00:45:57.864
We need one guy just to
pop up out of nowhere

1158
00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.822
and just start
slapping gold medals

1159
00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:00.922
and just doing his thing.

1160
00:46:00.957 --> 00:46:02.154
Do you know what I mean?

1161
00:46:02.189 --> 00:46:03.837
And kids be like. oh.
I wanna be like him.

1162
00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.366
- I don't even know if
it needs to be marketed

1163
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.929
but more so just normalised.

1164
00:46:09.427 --> 00:46:13.462
It's kind of like. how
you have that problem.

1165
00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:14.848
You bring a white
person to the cookout

1166
00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.872
and you make such a
fun fair about it.

1167
00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.908
Now it becomes a thing when
really embracing our culture

1168
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:22.405
shouldn't really be a
thing in the first place.

1169
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.110
It's just equality for all.

1170
00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:26.981
- I feel like swimming
and sports overall

1171
00:46:27.016 --> 00:46:30.820
but swimming as well.
it frees your mind.

1172
00:46:30.855 --> 00:46:32.888
Start you're in water.
just you know what I mean?

1173
00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.923
You're. intact to the
earth to a certain extent

1174
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:35.824
but on a deeper level.

1175
00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.464
And it goes for people
that jog as well.

1176
00:46:37.488 --> 00:46:39.532
That people like to jog and
go through parks on purpose

1177
00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:40.689
'cause it's nature.

1178
00:46:40.724 --> 00:46:43.005
Do you know what I mean. it
makes them feel a bit better.

1179
00:46:43.032 --> 00:46:45.230
I feel like it's a distraction

1180
00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:46.935
but it's a better destruction.

1181
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.498
For example. I've actually
recently been listening

1182
00:46:49.533 --> 00:46:52.369
to music only recent.
but I stopped for months.

1183
00:46:52.404 --> 00:46:53.986
And the reason why I
stopped was my mental health

1184
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.471
was a bit up and down.

1185
00:46:55.506 --> 00:46:57.539
And everything I listened
to just sounds like

1186
00:46:57.574 --> 00:46:59.981
steel pans in my ears
that it's not soothing.

1187
00:47:00.016 --> 00:47:01.444
do you know what I mean.

1188
00:47:01.479 --> 00:47:02.929
Certain music. certain films
we watch have an impact

1189
00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.359
to our emotions and
what we're going through

1190
00:47:04.383 --> 00:47:05.415
and it can trigger it.

1191
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.889
Swimming can't trigger it.

1192
00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.583
Going to the gym
can't trigger it.

1193
00:47:08.618 --> 00:47:09.584
And neither is jogging
gonna trigger it.

1194
00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:10.926
Do you know what I mean?

1195
00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:11.894
'Cause it's all life skills.

1196
00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:15.161
It's all free spirit.
do you know what I mean?

1197
00:47:15.196 --> 00:47:17.493
That part of it plays
a big impact on it.

1198
00:47:17.528 --> 00:47:21.134
- Swimming. unlike
for other sports.

1199
00:47:21.169 --> 00:47:23.235
can become a life
and death situation.

1200
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.633
Whereas the other sports
that are constantly promoted

1201
00:47:25.668 --> 00:47:28.339
are just for leisurely purposes.

1202
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:42.584
- Oh Layla.

1203
00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.193

00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:39.682
matter of fact you
actually will get in

1380
00:54:39.706 --> 00:54:41.046
and I'll put in a
good word for you.

1381
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.873
You fit that criteria perfectly.

1382
00:54:43.908 --> 00:54:44.974
- That sounds really good.

1383
00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:47.382
- I've always wanted to
go to the Amazon or Africa

1384
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.549
and experience
different cultures.

1385
00:54:49.584 --> 00:54:51.045
But one thing I
must let you know

1386
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.620
there's a level of
swimming involved so.

1387
00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:58.404
I was wondering when this swimming part
was going to happen

1388
00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.294
- I promised Ettiene

1389
00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:00.802
that I will have a
conversation with you

1390
00:55:00.826 --> 00:55:03.926
and actually try and convince
you to start swimming

1391
00:55:03.961 --> 00:55:07.864
cause you just tried to avoid
swimming as much as possible.

1392
00:55:07.899 --> 00:55:09.063
Because he said you can swim.

1393
00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:11.439
but you just don't wanna
get into the water.

1394
00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.474
Can you swim?

1395
00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.541
- Yes. I can.

1396
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.413
- Like swim properly or
are you now learning?

1397
00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.349
Did something happen?

1398
00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:21.416
- No. nothing happened.

1399
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.076
I can actually swim.

1400
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:23.111
I like to swim.

1401
00:55:23.145 --> 00:55:24.518
I don't mind it.

1402
00:55:24.553 --> 00:55:26.619
- So what is the problem?

1403
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.556
- Is private. I told you.

1404
00:55:30.724 --> 00:55:33.791
- So you know. the
swimming's event

1405
00:55:33.826 --> 00:55:35.496
that's happening in
a couple of weeks.

1406
00:55:35.531 --> 00:55:37.531
What can I do to
encourage you to swim?

1407
00:55:37.566 --> 00:55:39.797
You know. swimming is
very. very important

1408
00:55:39.832 --> 00:55:41.601
and I'm pretty
sure. you know that.

1409
00:55:41.636 --> 00:55:43.504
it's that the life
safety part of it.

1410
00:55:43.539 --> 00:55:46.133
the drowning
prevention part of it.

1411
00:55:46.168 --> 00:55:47.101
Just the wellbeing.

1412
00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:50.841
And you know. just the
recreational part of it.

1413
00:55:50.876 --> 00:55:52.447
The mental health part of it.

1414
00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.779
it's a very important
thing to do.

1415
00:55:54.814 --> 00:55:57.045
And I just don't get it.

1416
00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.389
I don't understand why you
don't don't do wanna do it.

1417
00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:02.787
And the worst thing is
that you're prepared

1418
00:56:02.822 --> 00:56:06.593
to sacrifice the expedition
just to not swim.

1419
00:56:07.794 --> 00:56:10.399
- I just don't wanna
swim. it's private.

1420
00:56:10.434 --> 00:56:12.830
- But yeah. that's the
thing that confuses me.

1421
00:56:12.865 --> 00:56:16.097
You don't mind it.
but you won't do it.

1422
00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:18.847
There doesn't seem to
be any logic there.

1423
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.519
Unless there something
that you're not telling me.

1424
00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.411
There's something
that you're hiding

1425
00:56:22.446 --> 00:56:26.074
and I'm pretty sure it's
hidden under the private.

1426
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:27.141
I just don't get it.

1427
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:28.417
I really don't get it.

1428
00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:29.251
I'll help you.

1429
00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:31.981
- I ain't doing no
stupid swimming.

1430
00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:45.797
- So literally did
our parents talk to us

1431
00:56:45.832 --> 00:56:47.502
about swimming or encourage?

1432
00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:50.835
I feel like only because it
was like we said. it was.

1433
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:51.770
- In school.

1434
00:56:51.805 --> 00:56:53.035
- In school. you had to do it.

1435
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.147
It was compulsory
to swim in school.

1436
00:56:54.171 --> 00:56:55.983
- But at the end. it's not
like they pushed us too.

1437
00:56:56.007 --> 00:56:57.622
That was just like
another thing in school.

1438
00:56:57.646 --> 00:56:58.612
School was the main thing.

1439
00:56:58.647 --> 00:56:59.448
- It's like PE.

1440
00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:00.174
You have to do it.

1441
00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:02.143
- So. but it wasn't their focus.

1442
00:57:02.178 --> 00:57:03.111
- Yeah.

1443
00:57:03.146 --> 00:57:04.486
- And even outside of school.

1444
00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:07.148
like I never saw
them swimming either.

1445
00:57:07.183 --> 00:57:08.149
So it's not like.

1446
00:57:08.184 --> 00:57:09.184
- That's true.

1447
00:57:09.219 --> 00:57:11.493
- We went on swimming
trips together as a family.

1448
00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:13.495
- When it's family time
at the beach and stuff.

1449
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.497
it's like. you sit
take pictures near.

1450
00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.532
like the kind of shallow ends.

1451
00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.732
That's it. that's as
far as like our uncles

1452
00:57:19.767 --> 00:57:20.799
and aunties were.

1453
00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:21.800
But I've never actually seen

1454
00:57:21.835 --> 00:57:25.001
any of them swim
properly before.

1455
00:57:25.036 --> 00:57:26.574
I don't know about you.

1456
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.070
- I don't know.

1457
00:57:28.105 --> 00:57:31.513
I think dad can swim or
I've heard him say he can.

1458
00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:32.548
- He can't swim.

1459
00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:33.174
- Yeah.

1460
00:57:33.209 --> 00:57:34.582
- He lying.

1461
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:35.828
- It's not like
something I've seen.

1462
00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:38.718
- I think that's the natural
thing of parenthood. isn't it?

1463
00:57:38.753 --> 00:57:40.225
You're always pushing
your kid to do things

1464
00:57:40.249 --> 00:57:42.084
that are best for
them in the long run

1465
00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:43.657
that they're gonna
get annoyed at

1466
00:57:43.692 --> 00:57:45.791
but they still need to do them.

1467
00:57:45.826 --> 00:57:48.596
And then hopefully in time.

1468
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:51.027
they will look back actually

1469
00:57:51.062 --> 00:57:53.535
and appreciate the
way you pushed them.

1470
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.610
- I think if your parents.

1471
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:57.099
if my parents never swam.
then I wouldn't swim.

1472
00:57:57.134 --> 00:57:58.738
And I just think
it's to do with that.

1473
00:57:58.773 --> 00:58:00.608
If you don't. if you never do it

1474
00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:03.237
then you'll never
know what it's like.

1475
00:58:03.272 --> 00:58:05.272
And it's not something.
if it's not something

1476
00:58:05.307 --> 00:58:07.516
that doesn't concern you to do

1477
00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:09.276
if you don't feel
the need to do it

1478
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:11.619
then I feel like it
just gets passed down.

1479
00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:14.281
It's just like. swimming's
a lot of concern.

1480
00:58:14.316 --> 00:58:15.215
- I don't have children.

1481
00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:18.153
but if I did I would
say I'll be worried.

1482
00:58:18.188 --> 00:58:20.562
I feel like everyone
should know how to swim.

1483
00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:23.290
Like for safety. number one.

1484
00:58:23.325 --> 00:58:24.458
And like being in water.

1485
00:58:24.493 --> 00:58:26.898
like as a child I feel like
you need to know how to swim

1486
00:58:26.933 --> 00:58:29.263
for like for yourself
literally. you know safety.

1487
00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:30.935
- So in the future with my kids.

1488
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:32.838
I'm definitely gonna
encourage swimming.

1489
00:58:32.873 --> 00:58:34.642
I'll get them started.

1490
00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.105
like how nowadays

1491
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.920
people are starting their
toddlers into swimming

1492
00:58:37.944 --> 00:58:39.845
just so in case they
fall into the pools.

1493
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.980
they can survive and like
float for a couple of minutes.

1494
00:58:43.015 --> 00:58:44.916
- I think I would
try and teach them.

1495
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:48.953
So just to have the extra
skill. like coming up.

1496
00:58:50.594 --> 00:58:52.792
I don't think like my dad
did the same thing with me.

1497
00:58:52.827 --> 00:58:54.926
I heard like some stories
and like in Scotland

1498
00:58:54.961 --> 00:58:56.598
of how people learn how to swim.

1499
00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.611
They're just like. yeah we
just toss the kid in the water

1500
00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.602
and then just like
start teaching them

1501
00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:01.229
at a really young age.

1502
00:59:01.264 --> 00:59:02.571
My dad never done that.

1503
00:59:02.606 --> 00:59:04.012
- I think it's a
necessary skill to have.

1504
00:59:04.036 --> 00:59:04.837
Do you know what I mean?

1505
00:59:04.872 --> 00:59:06.201
So obviously in Britain

1506
00:59:06.236 --> 00:59:08.269
we don't need to
worry about as much.

1507
00:59:08.304 --> 00:59:10.678
but I just feel like one day

1508
00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:12.350
your little youth is gonna
end up going to school

1509
00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:14.022
and then secondary school
and not some schools

1510
00:59:14.046 --> 00:59:15.650
and not they do swimming as like

1511
00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.718
like part of your
like PE and all that.

1512
00:59:17.753 --> 00:59:18.345
Do you know what I mean?

1513
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.786
So if he's going there.

1514
00:59:19.821 --> 00:59:21.227
last thing I want
my kid to get there

1515
00:59:21.251 --> 00:59:22.668
and everyone else is diving
and doing their thing.

1516
00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:23.592
And he's sitting
there being like.

1517
00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:24.186
oh yeah. I dunno how to swim.

1518
00:59:24.221 --> 00:59:25.627
Do you know what I mean?

1519
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:28.795
- So. it's a blessing
if they start young

1520
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:30.698
'cause every time
like I start learning

1521
00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:33.162
a new language in it.
once you start young.

1522
00:59:33.197 --> 00:59:35.736
like it's more easier to
learn it while you're young.

1523
00:59:35.771 --> 00:59:36.968
And like it goes on

1524
00:59:37.003 --> 00:59:38.376
and like you can
continue learning

1525
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.938
and learning and learning.

1526
00:59:55.318 --> 00:59:56.318
- Come in.

1527
00:59:58.057 --> 01:00:00.024
Simon. wasn't expecting you.

1528
01:00:00.059 --> 01:00:00.959
- Yeah.

1529
01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:01.894
I just came in from quick chat.

1530
01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:03.258
- Yeah. sure. take a seat.

1531
01:00:03.293 --> 01:00:04.293
What's up?

1532
01:00:06.263 --> 01:00:08.736
- You know I spoke
to that Frank guy.

1533
01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.298
He sounds cool though.

1534
01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:12.080
- Did you get anything
meaningful out of it?

1535
01:00:12.104 --> 01:00:12.905
- He seems cool.

1536
01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.401
He was but gassing me up

1537
01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:17.943
telling me he's got this music
video director link for us.

1538
01:00:17.978 --> 01:00:19.978
What I really need
to find out is

1539
01:00:20.013 --> 01:00:21.243
you still need me to do

1540
01:00:21.278 --> 01:00:23.410
that swimming thing
next week. ain't it?

1541
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:27.920
- Are you gonna actually
turn up this time?

1542
01:00:27.955 --> 01:00:30.725
- Do I really need to do it?

1543
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.222
- Listen Simon. I've got
this whole programme funded

1544
01:00:33.257 --> 01:00:36.764
and it wasn't easy. but I
need numbers to justify it.

1545
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.744
And this talk that you keep
saying that Blacks don't swim.

1546
01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.702
I don't know where
you get this from.

1547
01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:44.002
Swimming is extremely good
for your health and wellbeing.

1548
01:00:44.037 --> 01:00:45.685
And they're looking for
more ethnic minorities

1549
01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:47.841
to join the aquatic industry.

1550
01:00:47.876 --> 01:00:50.140
There are so many
opportunities for you

1551
01:00:50.175 --> 01:00:52.813
to train as a lifeguard
or swimming instructor

1552
01:00:52.848 --> 01:00:56.179
were almost a guaranteed
job at the end of it.

1553
01:00:56.214 --> 01:00:56.982
- All right.

1554
01:00:57.017 --> 01:00:58.445
All right. I'll do it.

1555
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.312
I'll do it.

1556
01:00:59.348 --> 01:01:01.987
- Listen. I know your
confidence is low

1557
01:01:02.022 --> 01:01:04.759
but this is why I want
you to link with Frank.

1558
01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.299
He's had to deal with
a few things himself

1559
01:01:06.323 --> 01:01:08.191
and he knows what it's like.

1560
01:01:08.226 --> 01:01:10.424
So keep in contact
with him. all right.

1561
01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.459
- All right.

1562
01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:12.294
Thank you.

1563
01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:13.329
- All right.

1564
01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:20.934
- Hello. Layla.

1565
01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:22.397
It's Frank.

1566
01:02:22.432 --> 01:02:23.398
Layla.

1567
01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:24.531
- Hello?

1568
01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:25.774
- Oh. okay.

1569
01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:26.641
Listen.

1570
01:02:26.677 --> 01:02:28.018
So I'm gonna use this
as an opportunity

1571
01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.514
to say sorry for what
happened last time.

1572
01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:30.878
And like I said.

1573
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.147
I should'nt have pushed you.

1574
01:02:36.182 --> 01:02:37.885
I should have known
and me of all people

1575
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.095
'cause I've been
through the situation

1576
01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:40.789
so I should have known.

1577
01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:41.856
So yeah.

1578
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.794
You there.

1579
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:46.861
- Hello.

1580
01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:47.488
- Okay. all right.

1581
01:02:47.523 --> 01:02:49.798
So this is what it is.

1582
01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:52.097
I'll just say sorry for. yeah.

1583
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:55.331
For what happened last time.

1584
01:02:55.366 --> 01:02:56.366
- Okay. bye.

1585
01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:01.844
- Okay. bye.

1586
01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.209
That was awkward.

1587
01:03:07.147 --> 01:03:08.147
Okay.

1588
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.094
- What about last night?

1589
01:03:22.129 --> 01:03:23.227
- Mel. oh my gosh.

1590
01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:24.393
That's so embarrassing.

1591
01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:26.329
- I know. when she
stood up at the cinema.

1592
01:03:26.364 --> 01:03:29.871
it was just. oh my
gosh it was so cringy.

1593
01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.169
- Bet that was so awkward.

1594
01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:32.874
- She'll never ever
leave that down.

1595
01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.843
I just remind her
about it all the time.

1596
01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:37.912
She's really sheepish about it

1597
01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:38.947
So funny.

1598
01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:40.915
Yes. lots.

1599
01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.855
- How did that call go?

1600
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.285
- Not too well. not too well.

1601
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.616
It was kind of awkward actually.

1602
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.024
- Oh really?

1603
01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:52.300
- I'm not so sure she
was even listening

1604
01:03:52.324 --> 01:03:53.620
to half the thing I was saying.

1605
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.138
- Dick said that you
were meeting some kids

1606
01:03:55.162 --> 01:03:57.063
that you'd been asked to mentor.

1607
01:03:57.098 --> 01:03:58.493
- Yes.

1608
01:03:58.528 --> 01:04:00.242
So I've been asked to mentor
these two young adults

1609
01:04:00.266 --> 01:04:03.300
and the part of a programme
for disadvantaged children.

1610
01:04:03.335 --> 01:04:05.566
And one of the. one of the
elements of the programme

1611
01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:08.976
is that they swim and
the girl in particular

1612
01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.879
she just doesn't wanna
get into the water.

1613
01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.111
- Can she actually swim?

1614
01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:12.947
- Yeah. yeah.

1615
01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.443
She said she can but.

1616
01:04:14.478 --> 01:04:15.589
- Will she not tell you why.

1617
01:04:15.613 --> 01:04:17.886
- When I. every time I tried
speaking to her about it

1618
01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:19.921
it just doesn't go too well.

1619
01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.996
- She might not wanna tell
you because you're a man

1620
01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.992
and it's related
to being a woman.

1621
01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.160
- Why. like what?

1622
01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.897
- It could be her body or
something to do with their hair.

1623
01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:31.031
or maybe it's a time of a month.

1624
01:04:31.066 --> 01:04:32.296
- It's time of the month.

1625
01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:33.231
Well. if it's the
time of the month

1626
01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:34.463
I suggest she sees a doctor

1627
01:04:34.498 --> 01:04:36.531
because I didn't think
they last that long.

1628
01:04:36.566 --> 01:04:37.631
- It could be something

1629
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.941
that's psychologically
affecting her.

1630
01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.141
A bit like you. before
you learned to swim

1631
01:04:42.176 --> 01:04:45.045
maybe something
emotionally or physically

1632
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.674
that's giving her
low self confidence

1633
01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:49.643
when she has to swim.

1634
01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:52.987
- Why are women so complicated?

1635
01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.023
- They're not.
you're just an idiot.

1636
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.356
- Coming from an
African background.

1637
01:04:59.391 --> 01:05:01.996
My mom can't swim. at all.

1638
01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:02.931
My dad's can swim.

1639
01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:04.361
but when I'm looking at properly

1640
01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:07.232
my dad's background of growing
up was a bit different.

1641
01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:10.565
So he grew up in Uganda and he
was quite exposed to beaches.

1642
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.643
And you know what I mean.
those type of things.

1643
01:05:11.667 --> 01:05:12.941
And my dad is quite active.

1644
01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:14.437
But when I look at it.

1645
01:05:14.472 --> 01:05:16.054
It's like. if the parent
doesn't know how to do it

1646
01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:19.013
and they don't necessarily
see it as a life skill.

1647
01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.477
why is it important for them
to reflect on their kids.

1648
01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:22.709
to teach their kids?

1649
01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:23.855
However. if it was
cooking though.

1650
01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.020
parents would be teaching
their kids. do you get it?

1651
01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.352
- Early on in life. you'll
see it as insignificant.

1652
01:05:28.387 --> 01:05:29.595
this. that and the
third you think.

1653
01:05:29.619 --> 01:05:32.026
oh when am I gonna get
into a pool anyway?

1654
01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:35.029
Or when am I gonna be
around water willingly

1655
01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.723
to have to be in that situation?

1656
01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:41.266
But then when you're actually
thrust into the midst of

1657
01:05:42.698 --> 01:05:45.105
can I swim or can I not swim?

1658
01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.736
Those are the moments that
you would wish that somebody

1659
01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:53.509
had had the foresight prior
to like get you into it.

1660
01:05:53.544 --> 01:05:54.643
- Yeah.

1661
01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:57.744
I think the climate has a
big factor to do with it.

1662
01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:59.614
I know a lot of people
they'd rather gone

1663
01:05:59.649 --> 01:06:02.320
in the swimming pool abroad
and stuff 'cause it's warmer

1664
01:06:02.355 --> 01:06:03.453
and stuff like that.

1665
01:06:03.488 --> 01:06:04.621
But like even in summer.

1666
01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:06.764
I don't see a lot of people
run into the swimming pools.

1667
01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:08.436
And I don't see a lot
of my friends saying.

1668
01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.657
let's go swimming.

1669
01:06:09.692 --> 01:06:11.098
You know. I know there's
the light

1670
01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.066
it's like an open kind of thing

1671
01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.035
like I know some people do that.

1672
01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.268
but I just don't
see a lot of people

1673
01:06:16.303 --> 01:06:20.206

1826
01:10:48.971 --> 01:10:50.388
- I'm not teaching
him how to swim.

1827
01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.719
I'm just trying to
encourage him to swim.

1828
01:10:51.743 --> 01:10:53.006
- Well like a mentor thing.

1829
01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:53.907

And that's. what's
makes me a great mentor

1831

01:10:58.882 --> 01:11:00.684
I have now learning how to swim.

1833

01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:03.357
Is it just the swimming?

1835
01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:04.919

01:11:04.954 --> 01:11:08.923
that I'll speak with
you about the gala.

1837
01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:10.859

There seem to be a
bigger issue about you.

1839
01:11:12.731 --> 01:11:15.699

1840

It's like a boat.

1857
01:11:47.832 --> 01:11:50.536
- Frank. why do Black
people need swimming?

1858
01:11:50.571 --> 01:11:51.933
- It's such an important thing.

You know. swimming is

1862
01:11:59.844 --> 01:12:02.977
It's such. it's one of the
best formal exercise out there.

You have to do it.

1864
01:12:04.585 --> 01:12:07.454
And every excuse you
could possibly give

1865
01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.895

01:12:08.919 --> 01:12:12.052

1890
01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:57.933
but like I'm not surprised
that Black people

1891
01:12:57.968 --> 01:13:01.442
like that much Black
people don't swim.

1892
01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:02.410
But the number is like a lot.

1893
01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:04.412
Like that's high.

1894
01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:06.007
I can't believe that.

1895
01:13:08.913 --> 01:13:10.022
- I didn't know first of all.

1896
01:13:10.046 --> 01:13:11.551
- I didn't know.

1897
01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:13.652
Like I've always heard
the thing you know.

1898
01:13:13.687 --> 01:13:16.523
blacks can't swim. Black
people aren't good at swimming

1899
01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.689
or don't want to swim.

1900
01:13:17.724 --> 01:13:19.493
But when you're talking
about the percent.

1901
01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.825
the actual stats.
I never knew that.

1902
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.432
- So yeah. after
hearing those figures.

1903
01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.675
it's always. you
know the running joke

1904
01:13:25.699 --> 01:13:27.534
of Black people who can't swim.

1905
01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.162
I was always aware of that

1906
01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:31.505
but it's really
shocking and surprising

1907
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.540
to know that it's
that many Black people

1908
01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.839
who do not swim at all.

1909
01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.038
- It's such a high figure.

1910
01:13:37.073 --> 01:13:40.074
And I. you know what.
I'm not surprised.

1911
01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:41.119
I'm not honestly surprised.

1912
01:13:41.143 --> 01:13:43.209
I am surprised it is so high

1913
01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:44.284
but I'm just not surprised

1914
01:13:44.312 --> 01:13:46.454
because like there's
something where black people

1915
01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:48.984
and water and like swimming.
it just doesn't go together.

1916
01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:50.051
do you know what I mean?

1917
01:13:50.086 --> 01:13:51.252
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

1918
01:13:51.287 --> 01:13:54.462
It doesn't. it doesn't. none
of us really liked swimming.

1919
01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:56.959
But they're strong swimmers
like Black swimmers out there.

1920
01:13:56.994 --> 01:14:00.501
But like. like not all of them.

1921
01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:01.744
Like if you're
looking at majority.

1922
01:14:01.768 --> 01:14:03.042
if you're looking
at those numbers.

1923
01:14:03.066 --> 01:14:05.033
it's like different
to how you would see

1924
01:14:05.068 --> 01:14:09.037
like white. Caucasians.
I mean. Latinos. Asians.

1925
01:14:09.072 --> 01:14:11.072
like we just don't.

1926
01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:13.514
We ain't got the numbers
on our side on our side.

1927
01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.945
- Thinking about it
now like the friends

1928
01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.685
that we've went swimming with
I'd say are similar to us.

1929
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.117
We've got friends that
have fun in water.

1930
01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:26.637
You know. there's kind of difference of
having fun in water

1931
01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:28.760
than actually
swimming. you know.

1932
01:14:28.795 --> 01:14:31.224
Like if we were in a situation
where we had to swim.

1933
01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:32.874
I'd be like we wouldn't
be able to do that.

1934
01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:33.798
- A small number.

1935
01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.063
- Yeah. yeah a small number.

1936
01:14:35.098 --> 01:14:36.164
- Or a confident team.

1937
01:14:36.199 --> 01:14:38.737
And that kind of matches up
with this statistic then.

1938
01:14:38.772 --> 01:14:40.684
'Cause when you think of
all how big our group is

1939
01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:42.906
and then maybe it's just two man

1940
01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:45.975
- Yeah. It's actually
weird water.

1941
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:47.581
- It's about 80% of a group.

1942
01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:48.616
- Yeah.

1943
01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:52.883
- That's weird how that
actually works out.

1944
01:15:16.007 --> 01:15:16.940
- Hey Layla.

1945
01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:17.941
I was just passing.

1946
01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:19.580
- Hey come in.

1947
01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.241
- Thank you.

1948
01:15:21.276 --> 01:15:23.316
- I was just passing. you
know. normally I'd phone.

1949
01:15:23.344 --> 01:15:25.718
I don't like anybody passing
when they don't phone.

1950
01:15:25.753 --> 01:15:26.818
But I was just in the area

1951
01:15:26.853 --> 01:15:28.248
so I thought I come and say hey.

1952
01:15:28.283 --> 01:15:29.183
- Sure. nice to see you.

1953
01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:30.316
I haven't seen you in ages.

1954
01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:31.559
- I know.

1955
01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:33.660
Ooh. let's see the nails.

1956
01:15:34.322 --> 01:15:35.288
Very nice.

1957
01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:36.323
What's that?

1958
01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:37.158
Is that?

1959
01:15:37.193 --> 01:15:37.994
What colour is that?

1960
01:15:38.029 --> 01:15:38.929
- Sherlock.

1961
01:15:38.964 --> 01:15:41.129
- Oh shelloc. it's expensive.

1962
01:15:41.164 --> 01:15:42.570
- Its worth it.

1963
01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:45.067
- Don't even look at my nails.

1964
01:15:45.102 --> 01:15:48.235
I've been trying to do some
gardening but is all good.

1965
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.973
Oh. I saw Fiona the other day.

1966
01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:51.073
Did you?

1967
01:15:51.108 --> 01:15:53.339
- We spoke about hair for ages.

1968
01:15:53.374 --> 01:15:55.187
She was just like. what
products should I use?

1969
01:15:55.211 --> 01:15:56.617
My hair is getting dry.

1970
01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.223
You know. the kind of
stuff we talk about.

1971
01:15:58.247 --> 01:15:59.180
In fact talking about hair.

1972
01:15:59.215 --> 01:16:03.690
like I need to talk to
you about mine as well.

1973
01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.350
It's getting long.

1974
01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:05.593
- It is.

1975
01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:07.595
Let me see. turn around.

1976
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:08.805
It is. it's looking
healthy as well.

1977
01:16:08.829 --> 01:16:09.829
you're looking after it.

1978
01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:10.763
- I'm trying.

1979
01:16:10.798 --> 01:16:13.128
I'm thinking of getting locs.

1980
01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:15.637
- But?

1981
01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.672
- It's just the maintaining
part of it like.

1982
01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:22.104
I feel like I should
do it in due time.

1983
01:16:22.139 --> 01:16:24.645
- So how's swimming.

1984
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.614
You've been for awhile.

1985
01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.377
- I haven't been in awhile.

1986
01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.214
- I thought you like swimming.

1987
01:16:33.249 --> 01:16:34.249
I do but.

1988
01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.790
- But

1989
01:16:37.825 --> 01:16:40.892
- Hmm. it's just I
have stretch marks.

1990
01:16:43.028 --> 01:16:44.698
- Oh. stretch marks.

1991
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:49.395
Yeah. it's nothing bad to
worry about in front of that.

1992
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:51.705
- None of my friends
have it though.

1993
01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.806
- You think none of your
friends has got them.

1994
01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:56.303
trust me. every
girl in some point

1995
01:16:56.338 --> 01:16:58.052
that you ask her she's
gonna get stretch marks.

1996
01:16:58.076 --> 01:16:59.779
So she's got stretch marks.

1997
01:16:59.814 --> 01:17:01.209
Maybe you just can't see them.

1998
01:17:01.244 --> 01:17:03.409
Sometimes it's on your
chest. it's on your bum.

1999
01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:05.653
wherever you start filing out.

2000
01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.689
So many of things that us women
have to go through sometimes

2001
01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:10.691
but it's nothing bad.

2002
01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:14.662
There's nothing to
really worry about.

2003
01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:15.729
- I don't know.

2004
01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.325
Do you have them?

2005
01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.161
- Layla?

2006
01:17:19.196 --> 01:17:19.997
My gosh.

2007
01:17:20.032 --> 01:17:21.196
Yes I do.

2008
01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:22.032
Trust me.

2009
01:17:22.067 --> 01:17:23.671
I'm just laughing

2010
01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:25.717
because it just totally reminds
me of when I was younger.

2011
01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:26.905
I was just like you.

2012
01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.369
I used to go
swimming all the time

2013
01:17:29.404 --> 01:17:30.603
and then just out of no where

2014
01:17:30.639 --> 01:17:33.681
I just started getting stretch
marks on my bum and my thighs

2015
01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.342
and I was like ahh.

2016
01:17:35.377 --> 01:17:37.080
And there was like no
Black girls around.

2017
01:17:37.115 --> 01:17:39.720
So can you even. you know.
go and confide in them

2018
01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.722
or ask their advice.

2019
01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.351
But eventually I got over it.

2020
01:17:44.386 --> 01:17:46.958
And one of the major things was

2021
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:52.161
I went out and I
found this swimsuit.

2022
01:17:52.196 --> 01:17:53.745
I still remember it
had stripes on it.

2023
01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:56.770
It was navy blue. but
it had shorts on it.

2024
01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.332
And I covered all
the stretch marks.

2025
01:17:58.367 --> 01:17:59.333
I was that was me.

2026
01:17:59.368 --> 01:18:00.873
I was back in the pool.

2027
01:18:00.908 --> 01:18:02.105
I was just like. yeah.

2028
01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.876
So once I took care
of that. that was it.

2029
01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:05.042
Nothing was holding me back.

2030
01:18:05.077 --> 01:18:06.477
I was just straight
back in there.

2031
01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:07.781
- Oh my days.

2032
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.113
A bodysuit.

2033
01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:11.785
- You can get
anything these days.

2034
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.447
Trust me. there's so many
options out there now

2035
01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.449
and there's like two pieces.

2036
01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:19.419
You can get shorts. so you
can get three quarter length.

2037
01:18:19.454 --> 01:18:22.158
You can even get
full body suits.

2038
01:18:22.193 --> 01:18:23.401
Cause there's people
who go swimming

2039
01:18:23.425 --> 01:18:24.776
and they don't want to
show any of their body.

2040
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.459
So you can actually
get a full covering.

2041
01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:29.066
- Oh my days. I've
got to get one.

2042
01:18:29.101 --> 01:18:30.298
- You need to.

2043
01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.069
I mean. they're a
bit more expensive.

2044
01:18:32.104 --> 01:18:33.466
but yeah it's totally worth it.

2045
01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:34.907
- Yeah.

2046
01:18:34.942 --> 01:18:36.942
In fact. I've got
something coming up.

2047
01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:38.878
I'm glad we had
this conversation.

2048
01:18:38.913 --> 01:18:40.374
- I'm glad to hear it.

2049
01:18:40.409 --> 01:18:44.510
But you know. like on a
more serious note though.

2050
01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:47.821
just never let
society dictate to you

2051
01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.350
where it is that you wanna do.

2052
01:18:49.385 --> 01:18:52.122
Don't let society dictate
what's right and what's wrong.

2053
01:18:52.157 --> 01:18:54.333
Everybody's got to do what
it is. you know what I mean?

2054
01:18:54.357 --> 01:18:56.423
But you're a really good swimmer

2055
01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:58.832
so you should never let
things hold you back.

2056
01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.339
You know. you've got
things that you wanna do.

2057
01:19:00.363 --> 01:19:01.474
There's things that
you wanna achieve

2058
01:19:01.498 --> 01:19:05.036
so make sure that nothing
holds you back from that.

2059
01:19:05.071 --> 01:19:07.038
And you'll be good.

2060
01:19:07.073 --> 01:19:08.270
- Thanks Julia.

2061
01:19:08.305 --> 01:19:10.206
You always say the
right things to me.

2062
01:19:10.241 --> 01:19:12.879
- You know I've been
through so much stuff.

2063
01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.047
but you know what?

2064
01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.542
I can not stop for long. but
I'm glad we had this chat.

2065
01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:18.016
I'm gonna get to get going.

2066
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:19.479
Give me a hug.

2067
01:19:19.514 --> 01:19:21.514
Right. make sure you call
me if there's anything

2068
01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:22.922
you wanna speak about. okay?

2069
01:19:22.957 --> 01:19:23.549
- Okay.

2070
01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:24.792
Thank you.

2071
01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:25.859
- No problem.

2072
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.289
- Hey Julia. how you doing?

2073
01:20:00.324 --> 01:20:02.830
- Yeah. so I've just
spoken to Layla.

2074
01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:04.403
We sat down. we had a
really good chat actually.

2075
01:20:04.427 --> 01:20:05.899
- Oh. whoa. awesome.

2076
01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:06.600
That is awesome.

2077
01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.396
- She told me about her issue.

2078
01:20:08.431 --> 01:20:09.562
I gave her some advice.

2079
01:20:09.597 --> 01:20:10.463
so she's feeling
much better about it.

2080
01:20:10.498 --> 01:20:13.104
So I think everything
will be all right.

2081
01:20:13.139 --> 01:20:14.611
- I just can't wait
to speak to her.

2082
01:20:14.635 --> 01:20:17.878
- But listen. Frank. don't
say anything to her yet.

2083
01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:19.440
Just let her come to you.

2084
01:20:19.475 --> 01:20:20.375
- Yeah I get it.

2085
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:22.212
I understand. I understand.

2086
01:20:22.247 --> 01:20:23.444
- Okay. cool.

2087
01:20:23.479 --> 01:20:25.182
All right. yeah say
hi to Jigs for me

2088
01:20:25.217 --> 01:20:27.283
and I'll catch you
guys soon. all right?

2089
01:20:27.318 --> 01:20:29.054
- Yeah. I'll send my love.

2090
01:20:29.089 --> 01:20:29.890
Cheers. bye.

2091
01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:30.925
All right.

2092
01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:31.551
Okay.

2093
01:20:31.586 --> 01:20:32.387
Speak to you later.

2094
01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:33.422
Bye-bye

2095
01:20:46.403 --> 01:20:47.875
- See. it's actually
quite proven

2096
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.009
that periods just kind of.

2097
01:20:50.044 --> 01:20:52.638
your body kind of stops
when you're in water.

2098
01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:53.539
Like it doesn't flow as heavy.

2099
01:20:53.574 --> 01:20:56.114
Yeah. I didn't know
that until recently.

2100
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:57.390
But your body doesn't
flow as heavily.

2101
01:20:57.414 --> 01:20:58.578
people don't know that.

2102
01:20:58.613 --> 01:21:00.096
And people think. oh
no. my periods come out.

2103
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.548
I don't wanna go swimming.

2104
01:21:01.583 --> 01:21:03.297
But then it's like. if it's not
your period. it's your hair.

2105
01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:04.661
If it's not your
hair. it's your gut.

2106
01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:05.762
If it's not your gut.
it's your stretch marks.

2107
01:21:05.786 --> 01:21:08.126
If it's not your stretch
marks it's something else.

2108
01:21:08.161 --> 01:21:11.195
And I feel like
there's always a but.

2109
01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:14.198
- Yes. I definitely feel like.

2110
01:21:14.233 --> 01:21:15.914
what is stopping Black
girls from swimming

2111
01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:18.070
is things like body appreciation

2112
01:21:18.105 --> 01:21:20.534
things like stretch marks

2113
01:21:20.569 --> 01:21:24.241
and how they view themselves and maybe how
society makes them feel about themselves.

2114
01:21:24.276 --> 01:21:27.981
And like from a young age you're
like what's going on around you

2115
01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:28.915
and on your body.

2116
01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:30.984
So I feel like all black
girls like avoid it

2117
01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.997
or even if they do go swimming
or like go to the beach

2118
01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.251
or like covered up maybe.

2119
01:21:34.286 --> 01:21:36.924
and like didn't want to
like show too much and.

2120
01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:38.662
- I don't wanna go in the
water and got my hair wet.

2121
01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:40.521
And I suffered
from eczema myself.

2122
01:21:40.556 --> 01:21:42.292
So when I go in the
water and I come out.

2123
01:21:42.327 --> 01:21:43.975
all my cream that I've
put on in the morning.

2124
01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.493
all comes up in the pool.

2125
01:21:45.528 --> 01:21:47.396
Sometimes that can be
a bit embarrassing.

2126
01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:48.947
Cause you're just
seeing like a cloud.

2127
01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:50.014
It looks like I'm
dirty. but it's not.

2128
01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:50.938
It's just my cream coming off.

2129
01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:51.697
Cause quite thick in it.

2130
01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:52.698
Cause I go eczema.

2131
01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:54.139
So my cream will come off

2132
01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:56.977
and I've come out
now my skin is great.

2133
01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.682
It looks like I've never
creamed in a month.

2134
01:21:58.706 --> 01:21:59.805
Do you know what I mean?

2135
01:21:59.841 --> 01:22:01.520
So if I ain't got the right
cream with me at the time.

2136
01:22:01.544 --> 01:22:04.380
it's just. it's a lot
of work just for us

2137
01:22:04.415 --> 01:22:06.019
to go in that water sometimes.

2138
01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.394
So especially that
when I'm on holiday.

2139
01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:09.319
if it's not for my
partner. I'm not bothering.

2140
01:22:09.354 --> 01:22:10.221
I'm looking nice.

2141
01:22:10.256 --> 01:22:11.057
I feel good.

2142
01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:11.717
I'm happy.

2143
01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:13.158
I get in the water.

2144
01:22:13.193 --> 01:22:14.698
And now I've got to be
thinking about my hair.

2145
01:22:14.722 --> 01:22:17.327
I've got to be thinking about
coming out. creaming my skin.

2146
01:22:17.362 --> 01:22:18.702
Sometimes you can't
even just creamy skin.

2147
01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:20.495
You need to have actual shower.

2148
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:21.496
Do you know what I mean.

2149
01:22:21.531 --> 01:22:23.333
to wash off the chlorine.
all the chemicals.

2150
01:22:23.368 --> 01:22:25.335
All the other dirty stuff
that's in the water.

2151
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:28.041
So sometimes it can
really be a lot of hustle

2152
01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:29.209
more than what people think.

2153
01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.385
- Yeah. 'cause you feel like
mainly like the White girls

2154
01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:33.343
they're very like slim.
the really skinny.

2155
01:22:33.378 --> 01:22:37.380
So you look and you think.
okay. I don't look like that.

2156
01:22:37.415 --> 01:22:39.712
So I guess it's
kind of different.

2157
01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:42.055
But still I don't
personally think

2158
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.265
that should stop
you from swimming

2159
01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:45.586
because everyone's
different obviously.

2160
01:22:45.621 --> 01:22:47.720
Not everyone's gonna
be like really skinny.

2161
01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.304
- Doesn't matter what
other people look like.

2162
01:22:49.328 --> 01:22:50.767
It doesn't matter
what other people say.

2163
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.099
You are beautiful.

2164
01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:56.036
These beauty standards.
it doesn't matter

2165
01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.270
because whoever made them
is ridiculous anyway.

2166
01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:01.635
And no one said that that
was the body to have.

2167
01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:02.636
And you just need
to love yourself

2168
01:23:02.671 --> 01:23:05.045
and you need to be
confident in your own body.

2169
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.771
in your own skin.

2170
01:23:05.806 --> 01:23:07.212
And then you start to realise

2171
01:23:07.247 --> 01:23:08.521
that what people
say doesn't matter

2172
01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:10.413
because you know
you love yourself

2173
01:23:10.448 --> 01:23:13.251
and you know that your opinion
is the one that matters.

2174
01:23:13.286 --> 01:23:15.990
No one else's opinion matters.

2175
01:23:25.595 --> 01:23:29.069
- You guys saying.
anyone want pizza fam?

2176
01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:30.136
- No G.

2177
01:23:32.305 --> 01:23:34.107
- What. no one fam?

2178
01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.570
- What's in it though?

2179
01:23:35.605 --> 01:23:39.145
- This is chicken.
beef. sweet corn fam.

2180
01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.082
- I don't eat beef.
I don't eat beef.

2181
01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:42.983
- Since when?

2182
01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.623
- The other day still.
I don't eat beef.

2183
01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:46.152
Told you fam.

2184
01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:46.919
Mans been watching the news

2185
01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.550
and watching what's
going on fam.

2186
01:23:48.585 --> 01:23:49.815
do your research fam.

2187
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.125
- Yeah. what's that got
to do with my pizza fam?

2188
01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.060
- Fam. what'd you think?

2189
01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:55.293
Whatever they eat. you eat.

2190
01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.132
- Meat is meat.

2191
01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:00.167
Food is food.

2192
01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.530
- Yeah but. I hear you.

2193
01:24:01.565 --> 01:24:03.697
You can offer my man then.

2194
01:24:03.732 --> 01:24:06.238
Say no more. you're
looking hungry you still.

2195
01:24:11.608 --> 01:24:13.806
- I won't say no.

2196
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:15.346
- Man then hungry.

2197
01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:19.548
That looks nice though.

2198
01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:22.419
- That's what your
missing out on.

2199
01:24:24.456 --> 01:24:26.291
- Man is gassed you now.

2200
01:24:26.326 --> 01:24:30.790
Fam. when this tape
drops. it's gonna be fire.

2201
01:24:30.825 --> 01:24:32.693
Frost is on his job today.

2202
01:24:32.728 --> 01:24:33.760
Fam is been on it.

2203
01:24:33.795 --> 01:24:36.103
- Fam. trust I got to say bro

2204
01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:38.204
hard fam. hard fam.

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:41.207
- This shit is
gonna be done fam.

2206
01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:45.244
Once you link up with the
producer with the film director.

2207
01:24:45.279 --> 01:24:45.871
- Wait. wait.

2208
01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:47.675
What film director?

2209
01:24:49.316 --> 01:24:51.679
- Frank is linking us up
for this film director.

2210
01:24:51.714 --> 01:24:53.780
He said. if we do
this swimming thing.

2211
01:24:53.815 --> 01:24:55.815
he's gonna hook us up with
the nice film director.

2212
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:57.124
- Boy hold on. hold on.

2213
01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:58.785
What are you talking about?

2214
01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.391
What film director is this?

2215
01:25:00.426 --> 01:25:01.854
And since then. could you swim?

2216
01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:04.692
- Don't watch that. it's
only for the swimmers

2217
01:25:04.727 --> 01:25:06.826
One. two. three.
the swimmers fam

2218
01:25:06.861 --> 01:25:07.794
Are you down to swim?

- Yeah. swimming is long man.

2220
01:25:09.633 --> 01:25:12.139
I'm not trying to swim.

You might as well just bring
me into the music thing.

Everyone go into the

- But I can't swim though.

2231
01:25:32.786 --> 01:25:34.590
Fam your always
honest. all the time.

2232
01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.295
- ain't nothing man.

2233
01:25:40.862 --> 01:25:43.830
- I just say. you know. get
in the pool. see how you feel.

2234
01:25:43.865 --> 01:25:46.470
But the one thing I
say. when we're someone

2235
01:25:46.505 --> 01:25:47.746
who doesn't know
how to do something.

2236
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:50.771
I say get comfortable
with what you're doing

2237
01:25:50.806 --> 01:25:52.311
and then I'll give them tips.

2238
01:25:52.346 --> 01:25:54.742
Like maybe you got to do
this when you're swimming

2239
01:25:54.777 --> 01:25:55.908
and they do it.

2240
01:25:55.943 --> 01:25:56.742
And I'm like.
okay. this is cool.

2241
01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:58.257
If you can't do it.
you can't do it.

2242
01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.430
If you could do it. that you try

2243
01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:02.255
and push yourself a little
bit harder every single time.

2244
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.851
- One thing like feeling
free in the water is like.

2245
01:26:04.886 --> 01:26:07.238
every day you wake up I feel
like you have something to do.

2246
01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:08.657
You have something to prove.

2247
01:26:08.692 --> 01:26:10.340
but when in water there's
no one to tell you.

2248
01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:11.264
you have to do this.

2249
01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:13.959
You literally just explore.

2250
01:26:13.994 --> 01:26:14.927
- It's once you get
to a certain age

2251
01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.368
once someone tells you something

2252
01:26:16.403 --> 01:26:17.941
like it gives you an
option to do something

2253
01:26:17.965 --> 01:26:19.965
you don't wanna do. you're
just not gonna do it.

2254
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.212
Like it's like trying teach
someone to eat vegetables at 16.

2255
01:26:25.874 --> 01:26:27.040
It's just not gonna happen.

2256
01:26:27.075 --> 01:26:29.447
But if they've eaten it from
the age of six or even just 10.

2257
01:26:29.482 --> 01:26:31.581
like they're gonna just
naturally. yeah like that.

2258
01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:33.286
that's fine. it's not an issue.

2259
01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:36.289
But you try and teach a 16
year old to eat vegetables.

2260
01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.488
it's just not gonna work.

2261
01:26:37.523 --> 01:26:38.962
So you just got
promoted from young

2262
01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:40.953
and try and bring
them to the fun places

2263
01:26:40.988 --> 01:26:42.240
where they can learn how to swim

2264
01:26:42.264 --> 01:26:43.692
or you need to learn how to swim

2265
01:26:43.727 --> 01:26:45.727
so you can go to
these fun places.

2266
01:26:45.762 --> 01:26:46.662
- You know. we're
in a generation

2267
01:26:46.697 --> 01:26:48.433
for we have so much opportunity

2268
01:26:48.468 --> 01:26:50.699
and so much access
to so many resources.

2269
01:26:50.734 --> 01:26:53.636
And if that's something you're
interested in and it's there.

2270
01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:55.341
take it while you have it.

2271
01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:59.004
And you know. kind of feel
your way through that water.

2272
01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:00.005
And in future.

2273
01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.348
you might be giving
yourself more opportunities

2274
01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:05.285
just in life in general
having learned something.

2275
01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.825
I didn't know. another
way by doing something

2276
01:27:06.849 --> 01:27:09.619
that people said you could
never. you never could do.

2277
01:27:09.654 --> 01:27:12.457
It encourages you in other
places and other aspects of life

2278
01:27:12.492 --> 01:27:16.263
that as Black people. places
we were never meant to be

2279
01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:17.759
- Most people like.

2280
01:27:17.794 --> 01:27:18.971
especially now like there's
hardly any jobs out there

2281
01:27:18.995 --> 01:27:24.304
like being a lifeguard. like
even like. what's it called?

2282
01:27:25.571 --> 01:27:26.812
Like. if you want to like work
on planes and stuff like that

2283
01:27:26.836 --> 01:27:27.913
like air hostess or
anything like that.

2284
01:27:27.937 --> 01:27:31.707
Like you need swimming as
part of your like skills

2285
01:27:31.742 --> 01:27:33.379
like to have those jobs.

2286
01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:34.622
So it would. it's
always a blessing.

2287
01:27:34.646 --> 01:27:35.942
You never know.

2288
01:27:35.977 --> 01:27:38.384
- I've have actually
tried to look

2289
01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:41.013
into being a lifeguard in the
past when I was a bit younger.

2290
01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:42.718
And then I saw in
the description.

2291
01:27:42.753 --> 01:27:44.533
you have to know how to
dive and hold your breath

2292
01:27:44.557 --> 01:27:45.721
and all of that.

2293
01:27:45.756 --> 01:27:47.690
And I just said.
no. no. no. no. no.

2294
01:27:47.725 --> 01:27:50.055
It's not that I would
never take a career in it.

2295
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.530
But the feeling that
I get in the water.

2296
01:27:52.565 --> 01:27:54.037
it's just I know it's
never gonna change.

2297
01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:56.303
'Cause it's never changed
from when I was younger.

2298
01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:58.646
- If I'm speaking to someone
that doesn't know how to swim

2299
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:00.604
or it's not like a
thing in their life

2300
01:28:00.639 --> 01:28:02.804
I would like pass on a
lot of like the facts

2301
01:28:02.839 --> 01:28:06.071
you just told me that this
could save your life one day.

2302
01:28:06.106 --> 01:28:09.844
So like. you need to like
try and look into at least

2303
01:28:09.879 --> 01:28:14.552
because like 85% of us
don't swim and you can like.

2304
01:28:15.885 --> 01:28:18.457
you can just. you can
die from it not knowing.

2305
01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:21.053
like it's a big deal man. like.

2306
01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:23.858
- I be like. bro. if you got
a learner you got to do it

2307
01:28:23.893 --> 01:28:26.333
because the end of the
day. like your gonna travel

2308
01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:27.400
and like do these things.

2309
01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.643
I think in the UK. we get lucky

2310
01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:30.403
because obviously like
if you're Caribbean

2311
01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.438
or something like that
or even African and that.

2312
01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:34.418
Like that's what surprising
with these stats as well.

2313
01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.035
And even abroad is
probably the same.

2314
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:38.675
where it's like you're
gonna be going into the sea.

2315
01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:39.511
You gonna be
swimming in the sea.

2316
01:28:39.546 --> 01:28:40.644
You gonna be on boats.

2317
01:28:40.679 --> 01:28:41.447
It's gonna be crossing
to other bits.

2318
01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:42.646
You know what I mean?

2319
01:28:42.681 --> 01:28:44.648
Like the last thing
I'll be bricking myself

2320
01:28:44.683 --> 01:28:45.583
if I was on that boat
crossing these bits

2321
01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:46.727
and I didn't know how to swim.

2322
01:28:46.751 --> 01:28:48.421
- It's never too late.

2323
01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.884
It's never too late.

2324
01:28:49.919 --> 01:28:50.819
You know what?

2325
01:28:50.854 --> 01:28:51.754
You might wanna swim now.

2326
01:28:51.789 --> 01:28:53.789
And you might not be able to.

2327
01:28:53.824 --> 01:28:56.924
Kids are very much at the
mercy of their circumstances

2328
01:28:56.959 --> 01:28:58.365
and their environment.

2329
01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.961
And even though I'm
not a parent yet.

2330
01:29:00.996 --> 01:29:05.438
I feel so much for your
kid wanting to do things

2331
01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.550
then having dreams and not
being able to give that to them.

2332
01:29:07.574 --> 01:29:10.476
I can only imagine how
heartbreaking that must be.

2333
01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:12.379
So I'm not gonna say now that

2334
01:29:12.414 --> 01:29:13.180
you know the best thing
you would do is to go

2335
01:29:13.215 --> 01:29:14.777
and nag your parents
and say yeah.

2336
01:29:14.812 --> 01:29:17.384
I wanna swim. I wanna swim.
make it happen for me.

2337
01:29:17.419 --> 01:29:20.145
If I'm sure if they could
make it happen they would.

2338
01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.818
- But if anyone asked me
like. is it worth doing

2339
01:29:22.853 --> 01:29:25.425
or is it worth trying
to be an Olympic swimmer

2340
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.151
and stuff like that?

2341
01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:26.987
I would push them to do it.

And then although
it was a journey

2356

and shall I say it's
been a challenge.

2357
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:02.539
but I was determined
to make it happen.

2358
01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.497
And I was prepared to
pull out every stops

2359
01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:06.059
to get them in there.

2360
01:30:06.094 --> 01:30:07.962

gonna happen anyway.

2361
01:30:07.997 --> 01:30:09.601

2362

2364
01:30:11.803 --> 01:30:13.176
and knew what they
were going to throw.

2365
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.244
And. but yeah. I'm so happy

2366
01:30:14.268 --> 01:30:18.203
that they're actually
decided to get into the water

2367
01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:19.039
and yeah.

2368
01:30:19.074 --> 01:30:20.546
But. hold on.

2369
01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.548
Something I need to
speak to you about.

2370
01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:25.749
There's a huge career potential

2371
01:30:25.784 --> 01:30:27.718
within their particular path.

2372
01:30:27.753 --> 01:30:28.653

2373
01:30:28.688 --> 01:30:30.490

last time as well.

to the second edition of
the Swim Ting Workshop.

2405
01:31:51.903 --> 01:31:55.003
I'm really pleased to
see all your faces.

2406
01:31:55.038 --> 01:31:57.104
See some new faces as well.

2407
01:31:57.139 --> 01:31:58.105
Yeah. really. really. thank you.

2408
01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.810
It's been a journey.

2409
01:32:01.011 --> 01:32:04.078
A bit of a challenging
journey in some cases

2410
01:32:04.113 --> 01:32:06.212
but it's something
I wanted to do

2411
01:32:06.247 --> 01:32:09.248
and Ettiene is gonna be
very. very. proud of you guys

2412
01:32:09.283 --> 01:32:10.623
for making this.

2413
01:32:12.022 --> 01:32:15.188
So for those that
don't know my story.

2414
01:32:16.356 --> 01:32:18.323
I only now just
learn how to swim.

2415
01:32:18.358 --> 01:32:21.194
I only started learning how
to swim a couple of years ago.

2416
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:23.295
So I was brought up
in an environment

2417
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:27.706
whereby water safety meant
stay away from the water

2418
01:32:27.741 --> 01:32:29.642
and you will not drown.

2419
01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:31.116
But we all know that
that's not possible

2420
01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.612
in this current day and age

2421
01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:34.680
but we all go on
holidays and stuff.

2422
01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:38.079
And yeah so it's water safety
is very. very. important.

2423
01:32:38.114 --> 01:32:41.313
It got to a point whereby
I couldn't do it anymore.

2424
01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:44.019
So I decided to
confront my fears.

2425
01:32:44.054 --> 01:32:47.726
address the stereotypes
and dispel the myths

2426
01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:51.191
and hence learn how to swim.

2427
01:32:51.226 --> 01:32:56.196
And it's glad because I could
use my journey and my story

2428
01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.904
to encourage other people to
learn how to swim as well.

2429
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:04.776
There's also the
recreational part of it.

2430
01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:09.242
the enjoyment part of it.
the pleasurable part of it.

2431
01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:15.688
And also there's so much
career potential in aquatics.

2432
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:20.385
And this is something they
should really. really consider.

2433
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:24.356
More importantly. the
enjoyment part of it.

2434
01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:26.666
So we're here to
enjoy ourselves.

2435
01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:30.131
So let's get in the
pool and splash around

2436
01:33:30.166 --> 01:33:31.166
