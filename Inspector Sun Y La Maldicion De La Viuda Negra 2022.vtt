<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Looking back. maybe they were right.</font>

418
00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:36.805
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bug. we need you.</font>

419
00:22:36.806 --> 00:22:38.657
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There's been a murder.</font>

420
00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.259
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A murder? I can't.</font>

421
00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.528
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Go on. you're a genius!</font>

422
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:47.366
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just a quick look.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Want to make sure we got the right bug.</font>

423
00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.301
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I let you keep the runt. didn't I?</font>

424
00:22:49.302 --> 00:22:51.169
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I could get in big trouble for that.</font>

425
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:52.838
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Fine.</font>

426
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.707
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you... stay put.</font>

427
00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:18.697
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So?</font>

428
00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:23.635
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He's a spider in a web. We do that.</font>

429
00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:26.405
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But it's not his web. And he's dead.</font>

430
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.980
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That is different.</font>

431
00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:36.998
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">If you could. just look at the patterns</font>

432
00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.950
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and confirm the black widow did it.</font>

433
00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.752
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Then I'm not to be bothered</font>

434
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.487
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">for the rest of the flight. deal?</font>

435
00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:44.990
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Tell me what you know.</font>

436
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.561
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Well. a passenger heard a scream...</font>

437
00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:51.329
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's not much to go on.</font>

438
00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:52.564
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You interrupted me.</font>

439
00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.600
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There's more? Go on.</font>

440
00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.469
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It was a woman's scream.</font>

441
00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.671
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">and the passenger.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">They pointed this way...</font>

442
00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.173
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I ran down and found Arabella</font>

443
00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:02.607
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">standing below the body.</font>

444
00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.811
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Okay. now the case is closed.</font>

445
00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:08.647
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She denied the whole thing.</font>

446
00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.417
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Case opened again.</font>

447
00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.287
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What the devil is he doing here?</font>

448
00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:18.156
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Thought as long</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">As we got the detective...</font>

449
00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.708
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mr. Bug is just a passenger.</font>

450
00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:21.193
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And this is a company matter.</font>

451
00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.995
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Where's the black widow now?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Locked in the hold.</font>

452
00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:26.331
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Good. She did it. Case closed.</font>

453
00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:27.766
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You don't get to say that.</font>

454
00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.134
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">he gets to say that.</font>

455
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:30.686
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-He needs to look for clues...</font>

456
00:24:30.687 --> 00:24:32.170
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Clues! What bally clues?</font>

457
00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:34.523
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I dunno. those cockroach footprints.</font>

458
00:24:34.524 --> 00:24:36.808
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">that piece of a fly's wing.</font>

459
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.161
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That suspicious hole burnt</font>

460
00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:40.846
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">through the floor beneath the victim.</font>

461
00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:43.582
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes. Those are all clues. which I saw.</font>

462
00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:45.217
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This isn't Shanghai. Bug.</font>

463
00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:47.385
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're 13 000 feet in the sky.</font>

464
00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:48.954
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">On my airplane.</font>

465
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.072
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It was a lover's tiff. plain and simple.</font>

466
00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:53.124
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And why wasn't she shown the door?</font>

467
00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:55.527
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The door is not that impressive.</font>

468
00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:56.661
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She's my guest.</font>

469
00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:58.196
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And from the looks of it.</font>

470
00:24:58.197 --> 00:24:59.664
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">not your biggest problem.</font>

471
00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:09.241
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sorry. Captain. I just thought...</font>

472
00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:11.510
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The master's working.</font>

473
00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.508
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-It's a widow. right?</font>

474
00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:27.959
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-It appears to be. yes.</font>

475
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.394
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Widow radius. widow shape.</font>

476
00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:30.762
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">widow bite. but...</font>

477
00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.831
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Case closed. We got our spider.</font>

478
00:25:32.832 --> 00:25:34.833
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-But only 40 percent of widows do that.</font>

479
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.402
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And she was one of them.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Get the ants in here to clean up.</font>

480
00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.471
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And for heaven's sake. keep it all</font>

481
00:25:39.472 --> 00:25:41.473
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">hush-hush until we reach San Francisco.</font>

482
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.974
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're probably right.</font>

483
00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:55.070
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait. how many legs</font>

484
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:56.855
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">did he have when he got on board?</font>

485
00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.257
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey. Detective.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're both missing the same leg.</font>

486
00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.425
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What are the odds?</font>

487
00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.044
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A one in eight chance. Janey.</font>

488
00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:03.595
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">just like flipping a coin.</font>

489
00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:04.763
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Let's go.</font>

490
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.898
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This case is closed.</font>

491
00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.266
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Have I made myself clear?</font>

492
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.333
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sure.</font>

493
00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:18.810
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">My goodness. You got a hunch!</font>

494
00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:20.979
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">No. it's just the way</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I walk with my missing leg.</font>

495
00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.614
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean. you got that look.</font>

496
00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:25.183
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Absurd. The gears in my head</font>

497
00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:27.218
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">are undetectable to anyone.</font>

498
00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:29.821
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">So. head of security asks you</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To look at the body.</font>

499
00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.799
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">but then the captain</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Doesn't want you near it.</font>

500
00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:34.392
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Then there's a hole in the floor.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I noticed that.</font>

501
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:37.495
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you and Bugsy missing the same limb.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">What was that about?</font>

502
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:41.099
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-It's a trademark.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Yeah. the Red Locust does that.</font>

503
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.667
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bites them right off.</font>

504
00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.636
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait... The Red Locust does that!</font>

505
00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.538
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But you put him away.</font>

506
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.457
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And that's why they call it a mystery.</font>

507
00:26:48.458 --> 00:26:50.308
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Oh. yeah! I am back in the game!</font>

508
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:52.711
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">If I can solve this.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll know I'm not just lucky.</font>

509
00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:54.613
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I can help.</font>

510
00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:55.680
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Never.</font>

511
00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.549
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I told you. I'm a huntsman spider.</font>

512
00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.351
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and a huntsman hunts alone.</font>

513
00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:00.552
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">If I let you help me.</font>

514
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:02.754
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'd have to come up</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">With a whole new catchphrase.</font>

515
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.923
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Suppose... Whatcha' doing?</font>

516
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.524
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Making a sound-proof curtain.</font>

517
00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:07.759
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I need to think.</font>

518
00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.161
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And when I think.</font>

519
00:27:09.162 --> 00:27:10.495
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I require absolute silence.</font>

520
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.199
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Okay. I'll be quiet.</font>

521
00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:15.900
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Right now.</font>

522
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:16.967
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Silent.</font>

523
00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:19.371
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Probably right after this sentence.</font>

524
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.139
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or this one...</font>

525
00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.878
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just let me know when I can talk.</font>

526
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.382
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I said... Let me know!</font>

527
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.889
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I think I'm nearly done thinking!</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">How about you?</font>

528
00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.531
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You know. I'm thinking as well!</font>

529
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.171
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Think. thinkity-think.</font>

530
00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.059
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Silent. being quiet</font>

531
00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.944
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and thinkity-thinkity.</font>

532
00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:10.055
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bug Detective? Sir?</font>

533
00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:21.299
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's how you think? Looks painful.</font>

534
00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:23.902
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Gosh! Don't worry. Detective!</font>

535
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:26.471
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">New apprentice to the rescue!</font>

536
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.206
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're not my apprentice...</font>

537
00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:29.974
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey! No!</font>

538
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.143
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hands off. buddy! I stalked him first!</font>

539
00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:45.924
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That was a glob termite.</font>

540
00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:47.659
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">They're like living timebombs.</font>

541
00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.112
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yup. They live fast.</font>

542
00:28:50.113 --> 00:28:52.297
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">die young and take it out on others.</font>

543
00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.782
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Thankfully. my soundproofing</font>

544
00:28:53.783 --> 00:28:55.200
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">protected us both.</font>

545
00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.968
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Someone clearly doesn't want you looking</font>

546
00:28:56.969 --> 00:28:58.670
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">into this Bugsy case.</font>

547
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.505
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The captain for one.</font>

548
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.890
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or someone has a grudge</font>

549
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:03.208
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">against housekeeping.</font>

550
00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:04.909
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This'll take ages to clean up.</font>

551
00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.578
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But it's probably the captain.</font>

552
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:08.179
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I gotta talk to the black widow.</font>

553
00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.917
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">No one gets past</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Without the captain's say so.</font>

554
00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.787
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey? We can't just do that.</font>

555
00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.989
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Pardon me. where are the toilets?</font>

556
00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.592
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">My gosh! I'm so sorry. ma'am!</font>

557
00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.096
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey. you're making things worse.</font>

558
00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.999
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just stay outside.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Try not to cause any more trouble.</font>

559
00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.577
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I didn't do it.</font>

560
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.717
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'd like to believe you.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'd like to believe in a lot of things.</font>

561
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:48.887
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">but I'm not a praying man-tis.</font>

562
00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.688
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's what you said last time.</font>

563
00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:52.423
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wasn't funny then either.</font>

564
00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.600
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Last time?</font>

565
00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.836
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Don't recognize me. Detective?</font>

566
00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.104
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I spent twelve hours</font>

567
00:30:06.105 --> 00:30:07.305
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">in Pearl City lock-up</font>

568
00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:08.807
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">just because you had a hunch.</font>

569
00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:11.609
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">How's your wife's investigation</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Going. anyway?</font>

570
00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:14.612
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Never did catch that killer. Shame.</font>

571
00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.881
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes. Arabella Obscuri.</font>

572
00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:19.083
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">you've certainly moved up in the world.</font>

573
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.786
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I recall you were also</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">In a heap of trouble back then.</font>

574
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.155
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But you couldn't prove a thing.</font>

575
00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.458
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just tell me. what was your husband's</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Affiliation with Red Locust?</font>

576
00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.211
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're the big detective.</font>

577
00:30:29.212 --> 00:30:30.495
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">you figure it out.</font>

578
00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:33.064
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm single now. Dinner this weekend?</font>

579
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:36.367
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sorry. toots. I don't like prison food.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Well. I tried.</font>

580
00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:39.904
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">My husband was a scientist. a genius.</font>

581
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.208
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">He did science stuff for that gangster.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But he swore he was through with it.</font>

582
00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.026
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We were starting a new life together.</font>

583
00:30:45.027 --> 00:30:46.778
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A clean life. and then...</font>

584
00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.379
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You killed him.</font>

585
00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:51.616
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">No. I loved him.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">After that talk with you. I was mad.</font>

586
00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.151
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mad at him for not telling me</font>

587
00:30:53.152 --> 00:30:54.619
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">about the notes. the danger.</font>

588
00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.888
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Then on the dance floor.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">He handed me this...</font>

589
00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:59.858
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">and said if anything happened to him.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I should give it to you.</font>

590
00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:02.427
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What is it?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-He said the less I know. the better.</font>

591
00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:04.662
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's just what</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">My high school report card said.</font>

592
00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:06.865
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I've got something else for you.</font>

593
00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:08.967
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Detective!</font>

594
00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.706
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He'll live. honey. No poison... this time.</font>

595
00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:17.976
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Go compare that to Bugsy's pinholes</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And tell me I wasn't framed.</font>

596
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:19.677
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I didn't kill my husband.</font>

597
00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.580
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I think she did.</font>

598
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:22.981
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah. she definitely did.</font>

599
00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.299
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">For sure. she did it.</font>

600
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.550
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">One hundred percent.</font>

601
00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.318
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey. you're a good kid.</font>

602
00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:30.021
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you helped me bravely save</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">My own life earlier.</font>

603
00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.489
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So I'm going to repay you.</font>

604
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.476
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I can't risk you getting hurt.</font>

605
00:31:34.477 --> 00:31:36.661
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What? Detective. no!</font>

606
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.863
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Things could get dangerous out there.</font>

607
00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.800
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-There he is!</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Get him!</font>

608
00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.603
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait! Detective!</font>

609
00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.897
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Either Bug had the seafood risotto.</font>

610
00:31:55.898 --> 00:31:57.916
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">or there's a glob termite on board.</font>

611
00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:59.183
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Disgusting!</font>

612
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.653
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't know how this could've happened.</font>

613
00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.588
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll tell you how. it's Bug.</font>

614
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.724
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Trouble follows him wherever he goes.</font>

615
00:32:05.725 --> 00:32:07.792
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He's really put his foot in it now.</font>

616
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.462
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Find Bug and lock him up!</font>

617
00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:33.935
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now all I have to do</font>

618
00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:35.286
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">is properly inspect the...</font>

619
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:38.456
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What the...? Too late.</font>

620
00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.992
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey. you work here?</font>

621
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.870
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Impossible! He's dead!</font>

622
00:32:58.276 --> 00:32:59.711
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Clean up crew!</font>

623
00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:02.547
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Stop! Police!</font>

624
00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:04.465
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean... Police. but on vacation.</font>

625
00:33:04.466 --> 00:33:06.317
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean... Just stop!</font>

626
00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.493
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Stop right there.</font>

627
00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.435
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The body is hollow?</font>

628
00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:42.387
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Stop in the name of...!</font>

629
00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.677
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ants. They're so darn organized.</font>

630
00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.722
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Nice doggy.</font>

631
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.107
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This plane has everything.</font>

632
00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:41.145
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Who dares enter ant territory?</font>

633
00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:45.650
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No eight. six... or even seven-legger</font>

634
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:48.186
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">may enter my domain.</font>

635
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.133
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The famous Bug Detective.</font>

636
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.335
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're not going anywhere. Mr. Bug.</font>

637
00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.337
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No kidding.</font>

638
00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.272
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Not unless you help me.</font>

639
00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:11.342
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You see.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">A few of my workers have disappeared.</font>

640
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.995
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">One thousand. two hundred</font>

641
00:35:13.996 --> 00:35:15.480
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and forty-three to be exact.</font>

642
00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:17.348
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you actually noticed?</font>

643
00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:20.184
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No ant is too small not to be counted.</font>

644
00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:23.321
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">With all due respect. Your Majesty.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I got my own problems.</font>

645
00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.922
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm in need of a bit of evidence...</font>

646
00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:27.558
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mr. Bug.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Do you know what the ants' role is here?</font>

647
00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.893
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sure. You're workers.</font>

648
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.295
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We are the eyes.</font>

649
00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:33.030
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">ears and heart of this vessel.</font>

650
00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:36.033
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">This room is just a chamber.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">A small piece.</font>

651
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.702
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This entire plane...</font>

652
00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.504
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Is your colony.</font>

653
00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.939
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's an ant's world. Detective.</font>

654
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.543
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">You spiders are just passengers.</font></i>

655
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.246
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">We don't just work in catering.</font></i>

656
00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.317
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ok. we mostly work in catering.</font></i>

657
00:35:52.318 --> 00:35:53.985
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">But we see all.</font></i>

658
00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.154
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">We know all.</font></i>

659
00:35:56.954 --> 00:35:59.323
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">And we report all to the captain.</font></i>

660
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.175
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">And he gives us protection.</font></i>

661
00:36:01.176 --> 00:36:02.960
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">Call it a symbiotic relationship.</font></i>

662
00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:05.947
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't get it. If you know all</font>

663
00:36:05.948 --> 00:36:07.732
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and see all. why do you need my help?</font>

664
00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.967
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Someone wasn't watching.</font>

665
00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:12.070
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Again? I already said I was sorry!</font>

666
00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:13.905
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Excuse me for not being perfect.</font>

667
00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.807
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Derek. did I say you?</font>

668
00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:17.642
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It could have been anyone. Sheesh...</font>

669
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.210
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So. if someone were to board.</font>

670
00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:20.711
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">say with a glob termite.</font>

671
00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:22.547
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">you would have known</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And dealt with it.</font>

672
00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:25.883
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes. But 1.243 ants gone missing</font>

673
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.502
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">means perhaps we've missed far</font>

674
00:36:27.503 --> 00:36:29.053
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">more than that. Can you help?</font>

675
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.421
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Only if you help me.</font>

676
00:36:30.422 --> 00:36:31.722
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I asked first.</font>

677
00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.457
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I thought about it first.</font>

678
00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:34.992
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Fine!</font>

679
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.068
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What you store as food.</font>

680
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:45.836
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I need as evidence. Only one piece.</font>

681
00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.522
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A spider's dorsal plate with</font>

682
00:36:47.523 --> 00:36:49.140
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">two distinct holes in the center.</font>

683
00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.648
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm investigating a murder.</font>

684
00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:58.950
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We knew that too.</font>

685
00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.718
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I need to know</font>

686
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:02.420
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">if this bite mark matches that one.</font>

687
00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.623
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No!</font>

688
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.259
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I saw. And the answer was clear.</font>

689
00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.461
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">They were as different</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">As the sun and the moon.</font>

690
00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.397
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The sun and moon are sort of the same.</font>

691
00:37:12.398 --> 00:37:14.265
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Both round. both in the sky...</font>

692
00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.583
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Like chalk and cheese.</font>

693
00:37:15.584 --> 00:37:16.834
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Both delicious?</font>

694
00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:19.770
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The bite marks were not the same.</font>

695
00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.489
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So she didn't do it!</font>

696
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.140
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Nice detective work. Bug.</font>

697
00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:26.911
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Find out what happened to my workers</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">By the flight's end.</font>

698
00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.730
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">or we come for you in numbers</font>

699
00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:30.481
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and eat you alive.</font>

700
00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.589
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-There's no way out.</font>

701
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.806
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Have you tried?</font>

702
00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:57.575
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Why should I?</font>

703
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.511
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm a lot safer in here. You too.</font>

704
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.947
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I suppose. You really like</font>

705
00:38:02.948 --> 00:38:04.448
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bug Detective. right?</font>

706
00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:07.251
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I like my men a little dumb</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And a little down on their luck.</font>

707
00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:08.486
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">so yeah. why not.</font>

708
00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:10.388
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You know he lost his wife. right?</font>

709
00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:13.758
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I literally just lost my husband.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Single is single.</font>

710
00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:16.227
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll tell you. I remember</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">When his wife passed away.</font>

711
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:17.828
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He shook every web in town.</font>

712
00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.897
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Of all the crazy crime Bug's</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mixed up in.</font>

713
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.533
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">his wife bites it in a burglary</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Gone bad.</font>

714
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.400
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">If he would've been home that night</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Instead of working that case...</font>

715
00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.071
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That case was the Red Locust. right?</font>

716
00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:30.041
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah. and he's been picking off</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">His swarm ever since.</font>

717
00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:31.709
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Guess that's all he has since then.</font>

718
00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.812
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">What about you. kid?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Folks must be worried sick about you.</font>

719
00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.181
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">My parents ain't around anymore.</font>

720
00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.050
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sorry. Tough break.</font>

721
00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:43.954
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Where's Bug?</font>

722
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.256
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You just missed him.</font>

723
00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.426
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">What are you doing here?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I thought you were his sidekick.</font>

724
00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.695
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I am. I'm just... doing it from here.</font>

725
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:52.196
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Can you show me where he went?</font>

726
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:56.067
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Kid. I wouldn't trust this crumb.</font>

727
00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.435
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You ought to thank me. doll.</font>

728
00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.803
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm the one who got Bug</font>

729
00:38:58.804 --> 00:39:00.104
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">started on this case.</font>

730
00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.644
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Can't have you running off.</font>

731
00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:09.447
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you. stay here.</font>

732
00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.615
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">As if I have a choice.</font>

733
00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:00.664
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What is this? Laundry day?</font>

734
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.566
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It was the honeymoon suite.</font>

735
00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.352
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Every time you walk into a room.</font>

736
00:40:04.353 --> 00:40:06.070
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">it ends up redecorated.</font>

737
00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.606
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I hope you can pay for the damage.</font>

738
00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.974
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I didn't do any of this!</font>

739
00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:11.275
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Apart from that.</font>

740
00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.277
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But I got news for you.</font>

741
00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.212
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-No!</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Arabella is innocent.</font>

742
00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.781
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The bite marks didn't match.</font>

743
00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:17.882
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You got proof?</font>

744
00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.483
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes. Cast iron proof.</font>

745
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.586
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">If you can accept proof</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">That has been eaten by the Ant Queen.</font>

746
00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:23.954
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The Ant Queen?</font>

747
00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:27.391
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You sure do get around. don't you?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Are you mad?</font>

748
00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:29.026
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I am mad.</font>

749
00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:31.229
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mad for justice. Mad for clues.</font>

750
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.364
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Clues that lead to facts.</font>

751
00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.499
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You've got nothing.</font>

752
00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.168
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">On the contrary.</font>

753
00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:38.769
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I know someone tried to off me.</font>

754
00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.807
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I know someone felt compelled to search</font>

755
00:40:42.808 --> 00:40:44.775
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">the honeymoon suite looking for clues.</font>

756
00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:48.646
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">or money or those little chocolates</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Left on the pillow.</font>

757
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.584
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I know Bugsy was working</font>

758
00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:55.052
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">for the Red Locust.</font>

759
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:58.022
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Who cares? The Red Locust is in jail.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You put him there.</font>

760
00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.990
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I knew that too. But did you know</font>

761
00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:01.892
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">that Bugsy was left a hollow shell?</font>

762
00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:04.361
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">As if sucked dry from the inside out.</font>

763
00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:06.964
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Only one insect can do that.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And it's not a black widow.</font>

764
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.599
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">An assassin bug?</font>

765
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.167
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">On my plane? Impossible.</font>

766
00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:11.936
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The ants go through this whole aircraft</font>

767
00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:13.637
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">before takeoff with a fine-tooth comb.</font>

768
00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:14.972
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's actually a toothbrush.</font>

769
00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:17.575
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">and it's that lack of attention</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To detail that wound up</font>

770
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.210
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">with a glob bug globbing me!</font>

771
00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:22.480
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Maybe you brought that on board.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Like you brought on board that stowaway.</font>

772
00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:25.883
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Maybe you're the one not to be trusted.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Some ants are missing.</font>

773
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:26.984
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You have a breach.</font>

774
00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:29.286
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">We're not looking for one killer...</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But two.</font>

775
00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:31.822
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Maybe three... Do I hear four?</font>

776
00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:33.257
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Four?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Sold.</font>

777
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.992
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm not buying any of this.</font>

778
00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:37.161
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't think anyone is buying that.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's broken.</font>

779
00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:38.730
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean. Detective.</font>

780
00:41:38.731 --> 00:41:40.231
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I am placing you under arrest.</font>

781
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.102
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait... Fellas. can we talk about this?</font>

782
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:46.971
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Guess not!</font>

783
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.347
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey there. big boy!</font>

784
00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:15.633
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I am under your control...</font>

785
00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:25.192
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll deal with you in a minute. Bug.</font>

786
00:42:25.193 --> 00:42:27.211
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Need to keep up appearances.</font>

787
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.261
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ladies and gentlemen.</font>

788
00:42:44.262 --> 00:42:45.462
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">everyone having fun?</font>

789
00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.681
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Because here on Trans Air Airways.</font>

790
00:42:47.682 --> 00:42:49.833
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">we're all about fun...</font>

791
00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.435
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and safety.</font>

792
00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:54.071
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Drinks on the house!</font>

793
00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.662
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bug Detective!</font>

794
00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:23.801
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey! You under arrest?</font>

795
00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:26.136
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What? These guys? No. you?</font>

796
00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:27.838
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I asked you first.</font>

797
00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.239
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So what's the scoop?</font>

798
00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:32.509
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's a sort of spoon for ice cream.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait... Is there ice cream?</font>

799
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.945
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">When you discovered Arabella under the</font>

800
00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:36.880
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">victim. did anyone else hear the scream?</font>

801
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.315
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey. step back.</font>

802
00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:39.683
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This is police business.</font>

803
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.919
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">When you discovered Arabella</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Under the victim.</font>

804
00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.387
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">did anyone else hear the scream?</font>

805
00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.055
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah. She did.</font>

806
00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.494
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I know her!</font>

807
00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:52.262
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But the captain said...</font>

808
00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.598
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're on my team. not his.</font>

809
00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:02.990
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Don't forget the sidekick!</font>

810
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:04.375
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-This should be interesting.</font>

811
00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:09.146
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ma'am? Can you spare a moment?</font>

812
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:10.881
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just a few questions. Ms...</font>

813
00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.349
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Vatchu.</font>

814
00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.450
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bless you.</font>

815
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.320
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hi.</font>

816
00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:22.259
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm sorry. I must go. It's feeding time.</font>

817
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.961
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Your kids are very well behaved.</font>

818
00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.029
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Thank you!</font>

819
00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.764
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Are they always this good?</font>

820
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.965
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Why. of course.</font>

821
00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.767
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What do you feed them?</font>

822
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.435
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey. mind if I ask a question?</font>

823
00:44:31.436 --> 00:44:33.037
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">About the mystery?</font>

824
00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.773
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">So... Madam.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You heard a woman scream earlier.</font>

825
00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.676
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Why. yes. Was she all right?</font>

826
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.244
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She was fine.</font>

827
00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:41.478

830
00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.551
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's fine. I don't mind.</font>

831
00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.787
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Is that all you wanted to know. Mr. Bug?</font>

832
00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.088
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes. thank you.</font>

833
00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:55.092

<font face="proportionalSansSerif">captain's treat.</font>

840
00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.441
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I knew there was ice cream!</font>

841
00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:11.875
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You two have a choice.</font>

842
00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.877
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Knock it off. or be thrown off!</font>

843

<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you. you work for me! Got it?</font>

844
00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.514
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Good.</font>

845
00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:23.887
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hit it. boys! And fill the floor.</font>

846
00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:36.666
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now what?</font>

847

<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Care for a dance?</font>

848
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.071
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You escaped?</font>

849
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.477
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Arabella. You're putting us both</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">In terrible danger.</font>

850
00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.348
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">We're beyond that now.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Save me. Bug!</font>

851
00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:52.883
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mind if I cut in?</font>

852
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.635

- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Now what?</font>

853
00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.670
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You need to clear the dance floor!</font>

854
00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.809
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's just like the hole we saw</font>

855
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.344
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">when Bugsy was murdered!</font>

856
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.114
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Someone was... killed?</font>

857
00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:27.017
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No one was killed!</font>

858
00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:28.952
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Everyone just remain calm.</font>

859
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.905
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Lady Vatchu!</font>

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:06.056
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hey. does anyone speak assassin bug?</font>

863
00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:07.641
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Do you speak French?</font>

864
00:47:07.642 --> 00:47:08.859
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Do you speak Spanish?</font>

865
00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:09.927
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Do you speak Chinese?</font>

866
00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:13.864
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Fire!</font>

867
00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:14.998
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Fire more!</font>

868
00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:19.002
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Stop! I need to question him!</font>

869
00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.676
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ready. when I say fire...</font>

870
00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:28.445
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or I say fire...</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Whichever one says fire first.</font>

871
00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.745
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So now?</font>

872
00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.600
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No!</font>

873
00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:05.799
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mr. Scarab. destroy it.</font>

874
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.017
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Whatever it takes.</font>

875
00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.886
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But Bug wants to interrogate...</font>

876
00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.871
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Who's your boss. Bug or me?</font>

877
00:48:10.872 --> 00:48:12.789
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Do it or I'll get someone who can!</font>

878
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.459
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Let's go. men! Hup. hup. hup!</font>

879
00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.897
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We'll never catch up to them.</font>

880
00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:21.632
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah?</font>

881
00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:24.835
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I'm getting down.</font>

882
00:48:24.836 --> 00:48:25.903
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-You better hang on.</font>

883
00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.073
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Freedom!</font>

884
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:34.444
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Let me down!</font>

885
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:40.650
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There!</font>

886
00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.046
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There are humans on board!</font>

887
00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:10.547
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">How disgusting!</font>

888
00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.816
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Speaking of disgusting...</font>

889
00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.219
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Glass. Gets 'em every time.</font>

890
00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.805
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now's our chance!</font>

891
00:49:17.806 --> 00:49:19.323
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Stop in the name of the law!</font>

892
00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.082
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There he is!</font>

893
00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:51.288
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Roger! No!</font>

894
00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:05.369
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</font>

895
00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:08.275
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Does it involve three pounds</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Of liverwurst and a tube of toothpaste?</font>

896
00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.606
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-No.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Then no.</font>

897
00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:12.175
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We take the express elevator.</font>

898
00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.454
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Spiders!</font>

899
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.056
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Spiders? Where?</font>

900
00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.208
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Calm down. sir.</font>

901
00:50:28.209 --> 00:50:29.359
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ma'am. please sit down.</font>

902
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:40.203
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Where am I?</font>

903
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.511
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Somebody didn't pay their electric bill.</font>

904
00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:48.612
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We're trapped.</font>

905
00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:52.015
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We're moving.</font>

906
00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:53.717
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I swear. it was a spider attack!</font>

907
00:50:53.718 --> 00:50:55.352
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Three. maybe four or five of them!</font>

908
00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:57.454
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's always something with you. Carol.</font>

909
00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.607
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">While we're waiting. the detective</font>

910
00:51:00.608 --> 00:51:02.359
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">has some questions for you.</font>

911
00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:05.762
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What's the point in doing that?</font>

912
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.231
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">As soon as this cup goes up.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">We'll be smacked dead</font>

913
00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.466
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">with an in-flight magazine!</font>

914
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:12.836
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or not. You know. in my younger days</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I was an amateur magician.</font>

915
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:15.238
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ta-da!</font>

916
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.408
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah. Now what?</font>

917
00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.008
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now listen. big guy.</font>

918
00:51:51.009 --> 00:51:52.776
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">we know you have an accomplice.</font>

919
00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.377
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">another black widow.</font>

920
00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.645
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Where is she?</font>

921
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.280
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And where's the money?</font>

922
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:02.018
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And why'd you drain Bugsy dry?</font>

923
00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.653
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And where's the money?</font>

924
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.859
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What? It's a good question.</font>

925
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:10.994
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So is: what's your favorite color?</font>

926
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:13.363
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">What's the capital of Canada?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">How do you spell Xanadu?</font>

927
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.466
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You do realize if you don't talk.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">We'll throw you right back out there</font>

928
00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.569
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and those leggers will stomp on you like</font>

929
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.604
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">clog dancers putting out a ground fire.</font>

930
00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.291
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-That's right. It does start with an X.</font>

931
00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:26.143
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-He said he didn't touch Bugsy.</font>

932
00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:29.546
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">He says Bugsy's the one who hired him.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Why? To do what?</font>

933
00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.281
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Seriously. everybody.</font>

934
00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.716
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm the detective.</font>

935
00:52:32.717 --> 00:52:34.084
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll ask the questions.</font>

936
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.769
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Wait. you speak assassin bug?</font>

937
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.387
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I did a year abroad.</font>

938
00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.792
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">To protect me? From who?</font>

939
00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:48.732
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Protect me from... a monster?</font>

940
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:55.739
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She's making it up.</font>

941
00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.973
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He's telling the truth.</font>

942
00:52:56.974 --> 00:52:58.141
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The wings never lie.</font>

943
00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:01.378
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Besides. if he wanted Arabella dead.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">She'd be dead.</font>

944
00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.868
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Dead like that.</font>

945
00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.186
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Well. at least the captain</font>

946
00:53:26.187 --> 00:53:27.437
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">will be happy.</font>

947
00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.026
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-The monster!</font>

948
00:53:33.027 --> 00:53:34.377
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Quick. follow me!</font>

949
00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:07.410
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">We should open a window.</font>

950
00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.234
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-No. no. please. not... again!</font>

951
00:54:14.235 --> 00:54:15.685
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-All right. where's the money?</font>

952
00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:17.821
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You got it all wrong. fella.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">What money?</font>

953
00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.990
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Don't play dumb with me.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy's fortune!</font>

954
00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.691
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I found a will in his suit pocket.</font>

955
00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.627
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It said his fortune was on this plane.</font>

956
00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.662
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sure wasn't in your room.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">So where is it?</font>

957
00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:28.331
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait! You.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're the one who ransacked their room!</font>

958
00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:29.666
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Guilty as charged.</font>

959
00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.818
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now fess up or you're both fish food.</font>

960
00:54:31.819 --> 00:54:33.703
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Five. four...</font>

961
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.455
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah? Bug will be here</font>

962
00:54:35.456 --> 00:54:37.140
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">in moments. and he'll save us.</font>

963
00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.207
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Really?</font>

964
00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:43.897
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Doubtful. Hi. Bug. just in time</font>

965
00:54:43.898 --> 00:54:46.116
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">to see a real interrogation.</font>

966
00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:47.284
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait...</font>

967
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.753
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now where was I? Yes.</font>

968
00:54:49.754 --> 00:54:52.155
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Where's the money? Five. four...</font>

969
00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:53.556
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I thought you were my friend.</font>

970
00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:55.623
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I thought you'd lead me</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To Bugsy's fortune.</font>

971
00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:58.361
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">So that's why you were pushing Bug</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To look into this case.</font>

972
00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:01.164
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm sick of playing second fiddle</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To flyboy Skelton.</font>

973
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.301
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But I'm even more sick of watching</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">This bozo fumble around in the dark.</font>

974
00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:06.570
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I used to think you were</font>

975
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:08.772
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">a good detective. Now... Five. four...</font>

976
00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:10.874
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There is no fortune. Never was.</font>

977
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.676
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's what I was going to say.</font>

978
00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:15.111
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy always said</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">His fortune was his work.</font>

979
00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.579
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And his work was science.</font>

980
00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.415
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's why he took work from Red.</font>

981
00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.650
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He should've gone into music.</font>

982
00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.352
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">or acting or street portraiture...</font>

983
00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.520
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">In that case...</font>

984
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.093
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'll take that orb.</font>

985
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.228
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What orb?</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-The one in your pocket.</font>

986
00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:33.655
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You don't even know what it's for.</font>

987
00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:35.666
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Does it matter? I know it's valuable.</font>

988
00:55:35.667 --> 00:55:37.434
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Hand it over. Bug.</font>

989
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.402
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You better give it to him.</font>

990
00:55:39.403 --> 00:55:41.304
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">if you know what I mean. Wink! Wink!</font>

991
00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:44.741
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I meant hit him!</font>

992
00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.808
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You said "give it to him". If everyone</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just said what they meant...</font>

993
00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.530
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Don't panic!</font>

994
00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.939
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Still don't panic!</font>

995
00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:19.542
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Panic! Panic now!</font>

996
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.581
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Let go!</font>

997
00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:27.584
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What're you gonna do?</font>

998
00:56:27.585 --> 00:56:29.052
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What I always do. wing it!</font>

999
00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:31.488
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Is that like a joke.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Because you have no wings?</font>

1000
00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:32.889
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I wish it was.</font>

1001
00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:43.466
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This pathetic handcuff won't hold me!</font>

1002
00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:45.201
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's not a handcuff.</font>

1003
00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.916
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But he has the orb!</font>

1004
00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.352
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Not the real one.</font>

1005
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:03.753
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Good job.</font>

1006
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.820
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Thanks.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Thanks.</font>

1007
00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:11.895
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">What the...?</font>

1008
00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.141
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Oh. my...</font>

1009
00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:27.510
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean... You guys. you were...!</font>

1010
00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:30.914
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Hey! I'm just trying to say thanks.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">-They can't hear you.</font>

1011
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.349
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">When ants get called back</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To the royal chamber.</font>

1012
00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.918
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">they enter a communal trance.</font>

1013
00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.420
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">See? The queen commands them all.</font>

1014
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.659
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">All that. for nothing.</font>

1015
00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:45.261
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't know.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Might make two nice soup bowls.</font>

1016
00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.530
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or bike helmets? Or...</font>

1017
00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:50.667
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Maybe Scarab took what was inside?</font>

1018
00:57:50.668 --> 00:57:52.635
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He wouldn't have had enough time.</font>

1019
00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.537
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sorry. I can't hear you.</font>

1020
00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:55.839
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Why would Bugsy give you</font>

1021
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.073
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">something that's empty?</font>

1022
00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:00.743
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't know.</font>

1023
00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:04.347
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But you knew all along Bugsy</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I were broke.</font>

1024
00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:06.316
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sure. let's go with that.</font>

1025
00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:08.535
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean. if he was as noble as you say.</font>

1026
00:58:08.536 --> 00:58:10.687
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">he wouldn't keep Red's dirty money.</font>

1027
00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.021
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Exactly.</font>

1028
00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.256
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So now what?</font>

1029
00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:17.460
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I need to think. And when I think...</font>

1030
00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:24.301
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-What's he...?</font>

1031
00:58:24.302 --> 00:58:25.702
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Absolute silence.</font>

1032
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.823
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Got it! Janey. quick. boil some water!</font>

1033
00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.758
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">How is that going to solve the case?</font>

1034
00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:51.561
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's not. It's going to make</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Some coffee. But I do have a plan.</font>

1035
00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.363
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Gather the passengers.</font>

1036
00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.897
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-I have to go so bad!</font>

1037
00:59:10.898 --> 00:59:12.582
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-He said no one can leave.</font>

1038
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:21.407
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Shortly after departure. a passenger.</font>

1039
00:59:21.408 --> 00:59:23.993
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy Spindlethorp. was murdered.</font>

1040
00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.765
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And his killer is still among us.</font>

1041
00:59:28.766 --> 00:59:30.934
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">In this very room.</font>

1042
00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:36.773
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mr. Gill Tea.</font>

1043
00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:37.941
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Sorry. Tay.</font>

1044
00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:39.576
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You were business partners</font>

1045
00:59:39.577 --> 00:59:41.144
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">with Bugsy. weren't you?</font>

1046
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:44.247
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So? That don't prove nothing.</font>

1047
00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:49.686
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No. No. it doesn't. Next.</font>

1048
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:52.221
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">At the crime scene.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">We found cockroach prints.</font>

1049
00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:54.674
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Mr. Scaraffa. Bugsy made you feel like</font>

1050
00:59:54.675 --> 00:59:57.060
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">a complete fool in front of your family.</font>

1051
00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.761
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You got plenty of motivation.</font>

1052
00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.364
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But it wasn't you either.</font>

1053
01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.367
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The footprints were way too big.</font>

1054
01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.137
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And what about the captain?</font>

1055
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.709
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Flies hate spiders.</font>

1056
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.177
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Everybody knows that.</font>

1057
01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:15.645
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Plus. we found a fragment</font>

1058
01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.046
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">of wing at the crime scene.</font>

1059
01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.882
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I always thought it was you!</font>

1060
01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.253
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'm innocent. I tell you!</font>

1061
01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.556
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He's right.</font>

1062
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.890
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Disappointing.</font>

1063
01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.527
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So moving swiftly on...</font>

1064
01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.146
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy boarded in the company</font>

1065
01:00:33.147 --> 01:00:34.697
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">of his new bride.</font>

1066
01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.566
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Arabella. a black widow.</font>

1067
01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.968
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It was her. She done it!</font>

1068
01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.939
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And according to the passenger log.</font>

1069
01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.041
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">she's the only black widow on board.</font>

1070
01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.093
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And it was a black widow's bite</font>

1071
01:00:47.094 --> 01:00:49.078
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">found on Mr. Bugsy.</font>

1072
01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.380
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're not helping.</font>

1073
01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.965
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But is she really</font>

1074
01:00:51.966 --> 01:00:53.483
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">the only black widow here?</font>

1075
01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:56.085
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Are you kidding me?</font>

1076
01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.143
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">There was a bite mark</font>

1077
01:01:03.144 --> 01:01:04.694
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">just like a black widow.</font>

1078
01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.597
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">but he was hollowed out.</font>

1079
01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.901
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just like an assassin bug.</font>

1080
01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.238
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But. as you can see</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">From our dramatic reconstruction...</font>

1081
01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:17.374
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">its proboscis couldn't fit</font>

1082
01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.775
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">in the bite marks.</font>

1083
01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.710
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It would have been too big.</font>

1084
01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:22.578
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He didn't kill Bugsy.</font>

1085
01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.647
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">In fact. Bugsy hired this assassin bug</font>

1086
01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:26.649
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">to protect his beloved Arabella.</font>

1087
01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.017
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-That too!</font>

1088
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.318
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Protect her from who?</font>

1089
01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.054
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Someone with a grudge.</font>

1090
01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.690
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Dr. Spindlethorp was a scientist</font>

1091
01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.925
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">hired by the Red Locust.</font>

1092
01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.695
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The question is... to do what?</font>

1093
01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.564
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A locust is nothing without his swarm.</font>

1094
01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.999
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And Bug Detective has spent</font>

1095
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.367
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">his entire career reducing</font>

1096
01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.369
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">the Red Locust to just that... nothing!</font>

1097
01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.470
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Thank you.</font>

1098
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.155
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So if I were a master criminal</font>

1099
01:01:49.156 --> 01:01:50.773
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and my swarm had been taken away.</font>

1100
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.908
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">what would I do?</font>

1101
01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.143
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I'd build a new swarm. A perfect swarm.</font>

1102
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.746
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And I'd hire a genius doctor</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">To create it.</font>

1103
01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.514
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy was murdered.</font>

1104
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:00.133
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">not by a roach. a widow.</font>

1105
01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:01.684
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">fly or assassin bug.</font>

1106
01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.586
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">but all of those things.</font>

1107
01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.505
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So either all of you did it.</font>

1108
01:02:05.506 --> 01:02:07.356
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">or none of you. Case closed.</font>

1109
01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:10.209
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Or he was killed by his own creation.</font>

1110
01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:12.995
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">a creature made to order. A monster!</font>

1111
01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.031
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A monster? I must get my children</font>

1112
01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:16.999
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">to safety as quickly as possible.</font>

1113
01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.535
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Those very well-behaved children?</font>

1114
01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:22.305
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yes.</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Women and well-behaved children first.</font>

1115
01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.006
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Except they're not children.</font>

1116
01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:25.807
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">They're not?</font>

1117
01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:38.321
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Because no child</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Is that well behaved all the time!</font>

1118
01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.860
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This is who did it!</font>

1119
01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:45.661
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">This is your every bug!</font>

1120
01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.399
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Thank goodness I worked it out!</font>

1121
01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.669
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">But although this monster</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Was created to build a swarm...</font>

1122
01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:55.505
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She would need to be a queen.</font>

1123
01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:57.507
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Now everyone's a detective.</font>

1124
01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.574
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Ok. ok.</font>

1125
01:02:58.641 --> 01:02:59.742
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I think I'm getting this.</font>

1126
01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.244
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So... Bugsy made a formula</font>

1127
01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:02.678
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">that could turn...</font>

1128
01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:03.813
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You can do this.</font>

1129
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.382
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">that could turn any bug into a queen.</font>

1130
01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.217
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Red Locust was happy. but...</font>

1131
01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.886
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy changed his mind!</font>

1132
01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.020
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Come on...</font>

1133
01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.739
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">'Cause he fell in love. learned</font>

1134
01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.390
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">what was really important in life.</font>

1135
01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:19.328
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And... And... Is that it?</font>

1136
01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.863
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">So he destroyed his work.</font></i>

1137
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:24.033
<i>- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">stole away the formula and booked</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">A one-way flight to San Francisco.</font></i>

1138
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.068
<i>- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">ready to throw it out</font>

1139
01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.870
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif">destroying it forever.</font></i>

1140
01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.605
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He did that?</font>

1141
01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:30.907
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's great news!</font>

1142
01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.508
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">No! He was murdered.</font>

1143
01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.661
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah. Bummer.</font>

1144
01:03:34.662 --> 01:03:36.746
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean... I'm sorry for your loss.</font>

1145
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.382
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bugsy gave me</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">The orb containing the formula.</font>

1146
01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.583
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And Lady Vatchu</font>

1147
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.486
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">must have seen this and switched the orb</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Without Arabella noticing.</font>

1148
01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.923
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And she. you know...</font>

1149
01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.641
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She killed Bugsy and drank</font>

1150
01:03:48.642 --> 01:03:50.293
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">the formula to become a queen.</font>

1151
01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.796
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">And Red Locust knew Bugsy</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Was going to be on this flight.</font>

1152
01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.731
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">so he made sure he was on it too.</font>

1153
01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.067
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Prick up your ears. Bug.</font>

1154
01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.804
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Red Locust? How? He's still in jail.</font>

1155
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.723
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">The Red Locust escaped.</font>

1156
01:04:03.724 --> 01:04:05.174
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and Bugsy's missing a leg.</font>

1157
01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.309
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Just like me.</font>

1158
01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.678
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">He's got to be on board.</font>

1159
01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:10.980
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And he's hiding right here!</font>

1160
01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.182
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I mean. right here!</font>

1161
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.885
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Would you let go of my face?</font>

1162
01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:26.195
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Bravo. Bug Detective. Bravo.</font>

1163
01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.268
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">So I guess you got me.</font>

1164
01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.469
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Again.</font>

1165
01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.712
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Yeah!</font>

1166
01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.563
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That'll hold them.</font>

1167
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.615
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Sure. Just like prison held me.</font>

1168
01:05:02.616 --> 01:05:04.600
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-But how did you get on the flight?</font>

1169
01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.519
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">It's not hard to get on board a plane</font>

1170
01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.371
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">when the captain is a smuggler.</font>

1171
01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.672
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I...</font>

1172
01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.907
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't like this.</font>

1173
01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:12.258
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't like this at all.</font>

1174
01:05:12.259 --> 01:05:13.542
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Something's wrong.</font>

1175
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.261
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I got a weird feeling too.</font>

1176
01:05:15.262 --> 01:05:16.913
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">and it's not indigestion.</font>

1177
01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.831
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I see the great Bug Detective needs</font>

1178
01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.683
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">an apprentice now.</font>

1179
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.619
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">I thought you were the huntsman</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Who hunts alone.</font>

1180
01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.621
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I am.</font>

1181
01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.273
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">But I was there.</font>

1182
01:05:27.274 --> 01:05:28.858
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">She figured the whole thing out.</font>

1183
01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.430
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">That's not true! I put it together.</font>

1184
01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:41.938
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">You couldn't put a two-piece jigsaw</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Together on your own. Bug.</font>

1185
01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.674
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">You're just lucky. Luck all the time...</font>

1186
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.909
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And lucky you got a sidekick now.</font>

1187
01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.695
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Well. you need a swarm!</font>

1188
01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:50.413
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">And you no longer have one.</font>

1189
01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.265
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">A swarm...</font>

1190
01:05:52.266 --> 01:05:53.716
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Wait. the missing ants?</font>

1191
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.685
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Wait a second. what are you up to?</font>

1192
01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:57.586
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">-Holy smoke. Alert the media!</font>

1193
01:05:57.653 --> 01:06:00.756
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">This guy just figured something out</font>
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">Without the kid holding his hand.</font>

1194
01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.224
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I don't need her!</font>

1195
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.393
- <font face="proportionalSansSerif">She's just some kid</font>

1198
01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.304
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">I didn't mean it like that.</font>

1199
01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:21.443
<font face="proportionalSansSerif">Janey!</font>

1200

1203
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.898
