One of the DEA agents
called back and said.

"You know that a bear

880
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.960

And at first I thought that.
you know. that was. they were.

She has her own theory

There was no cocaine

So where did the cocaine go?

891
00:47:01.719 --> 00:47:02.960
Well. the bear ate it.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.760
Well. no.
the bear didn't ate it.

about the bear

912

I think the purveyors
of the display.

921
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.360
if you press them.
they would tell you

that it's not the same bear.

923
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.880
It's symbolic.

924
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.719
So. what do the mall's
owners say?

925
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.159
They claim that
their "taxidermy bear

926

is 100% Cocaine Bear."

927

is your choice.

the real cocaine bear

is as mysterious
as so much of this legend.

932
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.239
The story begins with reports
of a dead parachutist

933
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.719
found wearing Gucci loafers.

934
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.760
and even that may be a myth.

935
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.159
There were incorrect accounts

936
00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:37.679
as to what exactly
he was wearing on his feet.

937
00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:41.039
There was one indication
that he had Gucci loafers.

938
00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:44.239
In reality. Thornton's
shoes were described

939
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.360
as the "Gucci loafers"
of the parachuting world.

940
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:54.079
He had some very expensive
jumping shoes on.

941
00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:58.119
When I was told about them.
they were equated to Gucci.

942
00:49:58.159 --> 00:49:59.880
That's how they tried
to correlate it to me

943
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.199
was this would be like Gucci.

gotten pretty close

947
00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:13.960

948
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.719

that we've put together.

With the individuals
that are still alive

950
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.800
and the agencies that did
the legwork that they did.

951
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.480
I think we got as close
to knowing what happened

952
00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:27.760
as we ever will.

953
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.719

If I had to go to my grave
with that on my conscience.

to stand very tall

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.119
Thinking about Andrew Thornton

969
00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.360
{\an8}would've Thornton liked to have
been associated with that?

970
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.840
{\an8}I think he would've thought

971
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.880
{\an8}the bear was getting
more attention than he did.

972
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.400
{\an8}and I don't think he would've
liked that whatsoever.

973

amused by it.
