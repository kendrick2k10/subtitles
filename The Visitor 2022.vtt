Miss Havisham?

12

We're home.

00:01:55.818 --> 00:01:57.950
This place is great.

14
00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.392
It's much bigger than
our flat in London.

15
00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:01.756
It's strange.

16
00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.089
It's not
how I remember it.

17
00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.860
Yeah. but that's
to be expected though.
right?

18
00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.433
It's been years.

19

that it's staying
in the family.

We'll fix it up.
paint some walls.

21
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.609

A new start. Robert.

00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:55.561

In the flesh.

38
00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:28.385
Well.
that is impossible.

39
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.893
'Cause I heard
she up and took herself
to London.

40
00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:32.895
found some British guy
and settled down.

41
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.831
Oh. Well. that would be me.

42
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.063
Some British guy.

43
00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:38.769
Judy. this is Robert.
my husband.

44
00:06:38.804 --> 00:06:40.771
It is so nice
to meet you. Robert.

45
00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.234
Likewise. Judy.

46
00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.544
"Likewise."
Oh. I like that.

47
00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:45.941
It's fancy.

48
00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:48.405
We could use some
fancying up around here.

49
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.242
Well.
I'll try my best. Judy.

50
00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.915
Sorry about your pa.

51
00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:54.983
Thank you.

52
00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.624
Tell you what.
Let's do this.

53
00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.120
Shots?

54
00:07:01.596 --> 00:07:03.387
It's the good stuff.

55
00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:09.866
To Edgar.

56
00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:13.232
To Edgar.

57
00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:15.839
To Edgar.

58
00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:21.614
Fucking hell.

59
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:25.552
What is in that?
The secret recipe.

60
00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:27.147
If I tell you.
I'd have to kill you.

61
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:28.621
but you definitely need
another one.

62
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.282
Oh. no.
you don't have to.

63
00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:31.789
Oh. he does.
Yeah.

64
00:07:31.824 --> 00:07:34.220
I got this.
I can handle it.

65
00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:46.969
No. get off.

66
00:07:47.004 --> 00:07:49.268
What did you say
these are. anyway?

67
00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.039
They. uh...
They're "chillins"?

68
00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:52.139
Chitlins.

69
00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:54.273
Oh.

70
00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:55.340
Like 'em?

71
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.583
Chitlins are good.

72
00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:00.378
What are they made
out of. anyway?

73
00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.380
They feel like. uh...
like chicken?

74
00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.657
Oh. uh. pig intestines.

75
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.518
You fucking--

76
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:11.961
Oh. my God.
Are you serious?

77
00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:13.600
Babe. gross.
I'm gross?

78
00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:15.030
You're making me eat
pig intestines.

79
00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:16.427
Hey. guys.

80
00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:19.573
These are from Larry
and Martha

81
00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:21.641
over there
in the back.
Huh.

82
00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:23.709
They just wanted
to say. "Welcome home."

83
00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:25.205
I am so wasted.

84
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.844
Oh. God. it's gonna
be rude if I don't.

85
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.472
This'll be
the last one.
Just pour it out.

86
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:30.474
No. it's fine.
This'll be the last one.

87
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:35.886
Okay.

88
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:37.415
That's definitely
the last one.

89
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.054
Maia!

90
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.636
The prodigal daughter
has returned.

91
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:51.231
Pastor Ellis.

92
00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:55.774
Now. would you please
just start calling me Joseph?

93
00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:58.711
You're a little
too long-grown for that
"Pastor Ellis" horseshit.

94
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.372
don't you think?
Of course.

95
00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:01.472
Yeah.

96
00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:05.784
Who is this hungry
new addition
to the flock?

97
00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:07.511
This is
my husband Robert.

98
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.855
Pig intestines.

99
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.894
Judy gave him
a little too much
special moonshine.

100
00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:18.324
As well she should.

101
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:21.129
Special drink
for a special guest.

102
00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:24.033
Well. Robert.
it is well past time

103
00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:25.496
that Maia
brought you around

104
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.102
to meet everybody.

105
00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:30.567
A hearty welcome
to Briar Glen.

106
00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:34.439
We are very. very glad
that you are here
with us.

107
00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:35.506
Know what? Everybody!

108
00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.245
Everybody. let me
have your attention.

109
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.018
It is with great pleasure that.
after many years.

110
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:43.580
finally...

111
00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:47.254
...the daughter of the great
Edgar Cartwell Eden has

112
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.959
returned to us.

113
00:09:48.994 --> 00:09:51.291
So I want everybody
to lift their glasses up.
Cheers.

114
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.394
To our own Maia
and Robert.

115
00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.835
Cheers!

116
00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:01.708
Long live the...

117
00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:03.720
You okay?

118
00:12:23.478 --> 00:12:25.445
You're home.

119
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.927
Hey. hey. hey.

120
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.720
You okay?

121
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:37.787
Hey.

122
00:12:37.822 --> 00:12:39.525
It was a bad dream.
huh?

123
00:12:43.102 --> 00:12:44.200
You all right?

124
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.973
It's okay.

125
00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:57.477
God.

126
00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:58.984
What happened last night?

127
00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:07.157
Um. you got wasted
and fell off your chair.

128
00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:11.755
I had to bring you
home. remember?

129
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.790
So embarrassing.

130
00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.594
It's okay.

131
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:17.629
I took
care of you.

132
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:20.269
Please.

133
00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:22.667
Stop.

134
00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:33.513
You have to stop
doing this.

135
00:13:34.615 --> 00:13:35.779
Doing what?

136
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.893
Freezing me out.

137
00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.757
It's not gonna
bring her back.

138
00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.339
You blame me.
don't you?

139
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.410
No. No.
of course not.

140
00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:05.347
No. I could never
blame you.

141
00:14:08.022 --> 00:14:11.221
I know how much having
a baby means to you.

142
00:14:13.324 --> 00:14:16.160
But it's like
the doctor said.
miscarriages happen.

143
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.162
Especially the
first time around.

144
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:22.199
Doesn't mean
we have to give up.
does it?

145
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.908
What if
it happens again?

146
00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:34.013
I know
you're scared.

147
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:38.644
I'm scared too.

148
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:40.844
In the last...

149
00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:45.090
...year.
I've lost our baby...

150
00:14:47.556 --> 00:14:48.885
now my dad.

151
00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:56.068
I don't know
if I can handle
another loss.

152
00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:02.866
But I believe
in us.

153
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.543
Don't you?

154
00:15:09.578 --> 00:15:12.150
Yes.

155
00:15:13.318 --> 00:15:14.713
Yes.
of course I do.

156
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.485
I believe in us
more than fucking anything.

157
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.883
I love you.

158
00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.093
I love you.

159
00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:56.644
What?

160
00:18:06.755 --> 00:18:07.952
Hmm.

161
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.120
Yeah. I guess
I can see a resemblance.

162
00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:12.660
A resemblance?
Yeah.

163
00:18:13.729 --> 00:18:15.762
Maia. it looks
exactly like me.

164
00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:22.065
Yeah. well. maybe if you.
uh. wore those contacts
I bought you.

165
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.275
Oh. God.

166
00:18:24.278 --> 00:18:25.706
See?

167
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:27.972
Hmm. Yeah.
not sold.

168
00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:30.843
I'm gonna need. like.
to see a scowl.

169
00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.318
There you go.

170
00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:35.419
I'm glad
you find it funny.

171
00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:40.017
All right. fine. yeah.
It does look...

172
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.327
It sort of looks like you.
yeah.

173
00:18:42.362 --> 00:18:44.153
Thank you.
Hmm.

174
00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:45.924
What do you
think it means?

175
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.157
I don't think
it means anything.

176
00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:50.236
Mmm.
People go to museums

177
00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:52.634
and see themselves
in paintings all the time.

178
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.900
This wasn't in a museum.

179
00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.870
It was in your attic.
Mmm.

180
00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:02.105
Yeah. well. my dad
traveled a lot
for work.

181
00:19:03.207 --> 00:19:04.679
He collected art.

182
00:19:04.714 --> 00:19:06.450
It was one
of his passions.

183
00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:08.716
so I guess
this could've come
from anywhere really.

184
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.883
What does it say?

185
00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:14.425
Says.<i> "The Visitor Accepts."</i>

186
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.328
Well. what exactly
is he accepting?

187
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:18.429
I don't know.
His drink?

188
00:19:21.533 --> 00:19:23.896
Well. he's a visitor.
so maybe. uh.

189
00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:27.064
he's accepting an invitation
to visit.

190
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.352
You're not still taking
that medication. are you?

191
00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:42.816
For your anxiety?

192
00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:44.521
No.
You sure?

193
00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:45.588
Yeah.

194
00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:49.955
No. I-I threw that
down the toilet
months ago.

195
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.660
The doctor said
it's only for emergencies--

196
00:19:51.695 --> 00:19:53.860
Please. Maia. come on.
Not again.

197
00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:55.301
I'm off it.
I'm done.

198
00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:56.401
Okay.

199
00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:27.531
Well. here's
your receipt.

200
00:20:27.566 --> 00:20:28.895
All right.
Okay.

201
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.437
It looks great.
Thank you.

202
00:20:32.472 --> 00:20:33.735
Here you go.

203
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.231
You have a blessed day.
you hear?

204
00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:36.309
Thank you. Kathy.

205
00:20:37.774 --> 00:20:38.806
Hi.

206
00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:42.744
You're--

207
00:20:43.307 --> 00:20:44.515
Robert Burrows.

208
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.111
Uh.
Maia Eden's husband.

209
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.217
We should talk.
Robert.

210
00:21:03.668 --> 00:21:04.832
Will that be all?

211
00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:12.444
Um.
just today's paper.

212
00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:13.610
if you have it.
Sure.

213
00:21:13.645 --> 00:21:15.414
Let me grab one
for you.

214
00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:40.769
All righty. then.

215
00:21:40.804 --> 00:21:42.441
Here you go.
Great. Thank you.

216
00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:43.772
That's awesome.

217
00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:45.741
Um. how much
do I owe you?

218
00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:48.447
Oh. please.
Your money's no good here.

219
00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:59.282
Art is a lie
that makes us
realize the truth.

220
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.896
You have a blessed day.
now.

221
00:22:12.363 --> 00:22:14.671
Okay.

222
00:22:27.983 --> 00:22:30.852
<i> Yeah. so it's two boxes</i>
<i>that haven't been delivered.</i>

223
00:22:30.887 --> 00:22:32.557
<i>Two boxes from London?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:22:32.592 --> 00:22:36.858
One of them is a. uh...
just a bunch
of personal items.

225
00:22:36.893 --> 00:22:39.190
and then
in the other one.
there's a suit.

226
00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.027
<i>And you still</i>
<i>have not received them?</i>

227
00:22:41.062 --> 00:22:42.996
Right.
<i>What's</i>
<i>the tracking number?</i>

228
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:44.470
Yeah. no. No. no. no.

229
00:22:44.505 --> 00:22:46.835
We-we. uh. we never received
a tracking number.

230
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.870
<i>Can I transfer you</i>
<i>to our shipping department?</i>

231
00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.608
Okay.
Yeah. sure. I can wait.

232
00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:56.845
<i> This is Mike</i>
<i>from shipping.</i>

233
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.176
Hello.
<i>Hello.</i>

234
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:00.277
Hi. Yes. Yeah.
So this is--

235
00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.345
<i>Two boxes missing?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.523
This is probably
the fourth person

237
00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:06.085
I've spoken to
about this.

238
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.460
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

239
00:23:07.495 --> 00:23:10.155
Yeah. we haven't
received two boxes.

240
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.531
<i>Okay.</i>
We never got
a tracking number either.

241
00:23:12.566 --> 00:23:14.258
A couple of people
have said that.

242
00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:16.667
on your end. it says
it's been delivered.

243
00:23:16.702 --> 00:23:17.734
<i>Here.</i>

244
00:23:22.576 --> 00:23:24.477
I don't know.

245
00:23:24.512 --> 00:23:25.775
Your dad's suit?

246
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.480
Well. you already stole
his overalls.

247
00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:31.077
Yeah.
but to his memorial?

248
00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:33.145
Well.
he wasn't wearing it
when he died.

249
00:23:34.082 --> 00:23:35.114
Go on.

250
00:23:36.447 --> 00:23:38.590
<i>We are here today</i>

251
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:41.087
<i>to remember</i>
<i>the fortuitous life</i>

252
00:23:41.991 --> 00:23:44.420
of Edgar Cartwell Eden.

253
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:47.159
Like most of us.

254
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.130
Edgar's roots
in this town go...

255
00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:53.462
go back generations.

256
00:23:53.497 --> 00:23:55.574
All the way back
to the early days
when this was

257
00:23:55.609 --> 00:23:57.972
just a patch of dirt
on a road
to someplace else.

258
00:23:58.975 --> 00:24:00.744
With Edgar's help

259
00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:05.716
and the help
of generations of Edens
that came before him.

260
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:10.413
Briar Glen was allowed
to-to become the safe haven

261
00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:12.987
for our community
that it is today.

262
00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:17.794
Y'all know how much

263
00:24:17.829 --> 00:24:20.357
Edgar loved this town
with all of his heart.

264
00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:26.737
He gave as much of himself
as he could possibly afford.

265
00:24:26.772 --> 00:24:32.303
He carried the weight
of his family's legacy
with honor and dignity.

266
00:24:33.174 --> 00:24:34.877
And make no mistake.

267
00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:40.179
we are less because of
his devastating absence.

268
00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:46.152
But there is hope.

269
00:24:46.187 --> 00:24:50.453
And that has come
to us in the form
of Edgar's daughter Maia

270
00:24:50.488 --> 00:24:54.490
and her new husband.
Robert Burrows.

271
00:24:54.525 --> 00:24:56.932
Robert. why don't you
stand up. let everybody
get a look at you?

272
00:24:56.967 --> 00:24:58.703
Everybody. give him
some encouragement.

273
00:24:58.738 --> 00:25:00.463
Robert!
Come on. Robert!

274
00:25:08.572 --> 00:25:10.814
Robert. I know
you're new to these parts.

275
00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:12.651
but I speak for everyone
when I say

276
00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:14.719
you already feel
like one of us.

277
00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:22.254
Thank you.

278
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.228
All right.

279
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:32.836
Nobody minds.
I think I'll read
from the big book again.

280
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:35.839
I like the words.

281
00:25:35.874 --> 00:25:38.776
And I'll keep it short.
It's getting a mite warm
in here. I know.

282
00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:46.916
Hey.

283
00:25:48.689 --> 00:25:51.888
Gonna head out
to the shops.
You want anything?

284
00:25:51.923 --> 00:25:54.418
Um. no.
not that I can think of.

285
00:25:54.453 --> 00:25:55.958
I'll call you
if I do.

286
00:25:56.763 --> 00:25:58.026
Okay.

287
00:26:25.253 --> 00:26:26.384
Can I help you?

288
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.189
Oh. Hi.

289
00:26:29.224 --> 00:26:31.895
I'm actually looking
for the other lady
that works here.

290
00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:36.768
I'm sorry.
Kathy's not here
right now.

291
00:26:37.969 --> 00:26:40.970
Do you know
when she'll be back?

292
00:26:43.502 --> 00:26:46.272
Can I just say.
on a personal note.

293
00:26:46.307 --> 00:26:49.077
how lovely it is
to have you here
in Briar Glen?

294
00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:53.180
The town has been
infinitely brighter
since you arrived.

295
00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:57.789
I'd be happy
to help you find anything
you might need.

296
00:27:00.794 --> 00:27:02.123
Uh...

297
00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:08.893
Hello?

298
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.231
Hello?

299
00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:08.606
<i>"The Visitor</i>
<i>Watches It Burn."</i>

300
00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:13.116
That's not for sale.

301
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:15.118
Oh. um...

302
00:30:15.153 --> 00:30:16.482
I'm sorry.
I. uh...

303
00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:20.519
I was just hoping
you might be able to

304
00:30:20.554 --> 00:30:22.521
give me some more
information about it.

305
00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:25.161
Anything would be
really helpful.

306
00:30:26.098 --> 00:30:28.164
It was here
when I bought the store.

307
00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:32.828
And judging
by your accent.

308
00:30:32.863 --> 00:30:38.471
I bet your schools
didn't teach you
the history of this place.

309
00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.836
So I'll give you
the short version.

310
00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:46.182
There was a whole lot
of bad going on
back then.

311
00:30:47.878 --> 00:30:52.254
And I'm not
the kind of person
who hides from evil.

312
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.926
No. sir. I--

313
00:30:57.921 --> 00:30:59.525
No.

314
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:02.693
It can't be.

315
00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:08.435
I know.

316
00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:12.010
Believe me.
I was shocked. too.
when I found it.

317
00:31:12.045 --> 00:31:15.244
I found another one
just like it
in my wife's family's house.

318
00:31:16.676 --> 00:31:18.709
Look.
I took a picture.

319
00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:20.249
How did you find me?

320
00:31:20.284 --> 00:31:21.580
It was a woman
named Kathy.

321
00:31:21.615 --> 00:31:25.452
She works in a store
in. uh. Briar Glen.

322
00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:27.960
She gave me this note
with your address on it.

323
00:31:27.995 --> 00:31:32.723
You listen to me.
and you listen good.

324
00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:35.264
You think
you want answers.

325
00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:37.002
You're wrong.

326
00:31:37.037 --> 00:31:40.830
The truth is
your worst enemy.

327
00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:44.372
What you need
is to run back
to London

328
00:31:44.407 --> 00:31:46.440
as fast as your legs
can carry you.

329
00:31:46.475 --> 00:31:47.936
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

330
00:31:47.971 --> 00:31:49.443
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
come here.

331
00:31:49.478 --> 00:31:51.049
Now go
and don't come back.
I'm sorry.

332
00:31:51.084 --> 00:31:52.578
I wanted to check--
Don't you ever
come back!

333
00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:54.382
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Sorry.

334
00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:55.515
Go!

335
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.156
Hey. Where were you?

336
00:32:34.523 --> 00:32:35.687
I was worried.

337
00:32:39.396 --> 00:32:42.067
What's that
doing up there?

338
00:32:42.102 --> 00:32:43.530
What.
we can't laugh
about this yet?

339
00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:44.894
Come on.

340
00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:50.372
You know.
I just found
another one.

341
00:32:52.112 --> 00:32:54.211
What?
Another painting.

342
00:32:54.246 --> 00:32:56.048
Of him.

343
00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:59.810
This time. he was. um...
he was. like.
a Confederate soldier.

344
00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:03.121
There was this crazy
old lady there.
and she was. like...

345
00:33:03.156 --> 00:33:05.013
she was. like.
clawing at me.

346
00:33:05.048 --> 00:33:06.520
She said
I had to move back
to London.

347
00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:08.324
What--
How did she know
I was from London?

348
00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:10.788
Your accent?
No. No. no. no.
no. no.

349
00:33:10.823 --> 00:33:12.658
It was--
it was definitely
more than that.

350
00:33:12.693 --> 00:33:13.725
It felt like she...

351
00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:17.366
I felt like
she-she knew me.

352
00:33:17.401 --> 00:33:18.862
The way
she was looking
at me.

353
00:33:18.897 --> 00:33:20.468
I feel like
everyone knows me.

354
00:33:20.503 --> 00:33:22.140
Robert.
okay. listen.

355
00:33:22.175 --> 00:33:23.900
I put this painting up
because I thought
it would be

356
00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:27.211
a funny. you know.
inside joke
between the two of us.

357
00:33:30.282 --> 00:33:34.515
I mean. you don't actually
think that's you
in the paintings?

358
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:43.656
Robert.

359
00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:47.627
I-I don't know.
It--

360
00:33:47.662 --> 00:33:49.860
Oh. my God.
It looks like me.

361
00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:52.269
This has got
to stop. Robert.

362
00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:57.967
We're gonna make
this place our home.

363
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.508
Do you even
want to be here?

364
00:34:00.543 --> 00:34:01.806
Yes. Yes. I do.

365
00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:03.412
Are you sure?
Yes. of course.

366
00:34:03.447 --> 00:34:04.842
Of course. Yes.

367
00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:11.585
Just think the stress
is getting to me.

368
00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:17.096
The bad dreams.
the move.

369
00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:23.058
You're right.

370
00:34:23.093 --> 00:34:27.568
I just need to. like.
focus on you.

371
00:34:27.603 --> 00:34:30.109
And us and this house
we're in.

372
00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:39.943
Know what?

373
00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.616
I'm gonna go
finish up in here.

374
00:37:20.303 --> 00:37:21.577
No.

375
00:38:24.543 --> 00:38:26.378
Welcome home. boy.

376
00:39:25.065 --> 00:39:28.066
<i>It spills over</i>
<i>into direct attack.</i>

377
00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:32.444
<i>and the workers</i>
<i>tear the chosen queen</i>
<i>to pieces.</i>

378
00:39:39.112 --> 00:39:41.310
<i>Nothing can go to waste.</i>

379
00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:43.620
<i>even the royal carcass.</i>

380
00:39:46.053 --> 00:39:50.759
<i>Workers carry hungry larvae</i>
<i>over to feast</i>
<i>on the dead queen.</i>

381
00:39:50.794 --> 00:39:54.598
<i>including many that must have</i>
<i>been her own offspring.</i>

382
00:39:59.429 --> 00:40:00.472
You scared me.

383
00:40:00.507 --> 00:40:02.067
Sorry.
I didn't mean to.

384
00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:04.641
What?

385
00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:13.309
You serious?
Yeah.

386
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:21.460
I'm gonna
be here for you.
I promise.

387
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.058
I love you.
I love you.

388
00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:54.922
<i>And he doth deceive them</i>
<i>that dwell on the Earth</i>

389
00:40:54.957 --> 00:40:59.388
<i>by the means</i>
<i>of those miracles</i>
<i>which he hath power to do.</i>

390
00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:02.600
And the beast
was taken and--

391
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.501
And the beast was taken

392
00:41:46.536 --> 00:41:52.507
and with him the prophet
who worked miracles
before him.

393
00:41:54.049 --> 00:41:58.755
These both were cast
into a lake of fire
burning with brimstone.

394
00:42:04.224 --> 00:42:05.861
Now. our Maia.

395
00:42:05.896 --> 00:42:08.358
she was always first
through the door
at Sunday school

396
00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.228
and last to leave.

397
00:42:10.263 --> 00:42:12.461
I had to kick her out
on. well...

398
00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:14.331
Oh.
...more than
one occasion.

399
00:42:14.366 --> 00:42:15.706
Don't give me
that face.

400
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:17.268
You know it's true.
you little rascal.

401
00:42:19.074 --> 00:42:20.612
Ah. watch it. It's hot.

402
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.582
Thank you.

403
00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:32.591
To your strong. healthy.
miracle baby boy.

404
00:42:34.287 --> 00:42:36.056
Cheers.
Cheers.

405
00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.863
Well. that's not
gonna do.
Drink up.

406
00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:51.335
You know. Robert.
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

407
00:42:55.308 --> 00:42:56.978
Are you
a true believer?

408
00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:03.248
Honestly. I'm not.

409
00:43:04.988 --> 00:43:06.449
Would you give me
your hands?

410
00:43:08.288 --> 00:43:09.320
Come on.

411
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.730
Come on. now.
Give me your hands.

412
00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:34.279
You will.

413
00:43:35.348 --> 00:43:36.985
You will be.

414
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.791
When you see for yourself.
you won't be able to deny.

415
00:43:45.259 --> 00:43:48.425
The. um...
the christening's
important to Maia.

416
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.965
So it's important
to me too.

417
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.329
Thank you.

418
00:43:56.105 --> 00:43:58.237
Well. of course.

419
00:43:58.272 --> 00:43:59.843
Of course.

420
00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:02.439
And I don't want you
to have any fears about that.

421
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:05.013
We do
a simple ceremony.

422
00:44:07.886 --> 00:44:10.821
None of that
drowning the newborn
around here.

423
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:13.956
That's a relief.

424
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:15.683
Listen.
I'm just gonna go
and use the loo.

425
00:44:15.718 --> 00:44:17.223
Okay. Bye.

426
00:44:18.798 --> 00:44:19.929
Oh. he means
the bathroom.

427
00:44:19.964 --> 00:44:21.997
Oh. Down the hall
to the right.

428
00:46:12.274 --> 00:46:14.879
Thought I was gonna
have to send out
a search party for you.

429
00:46:14.914 --> 00:46:18.982
Sorry.
I-I took a wrong turn.
and I-I saw this painting.

430
00:46:19.017 --> 00:46:20.247
It's...

431
00:46:22.218 --> 00:46:23.987
Do you think it...

432
00:46:24.022 --> 00:46:25.120
It's you.

433
00:46:25.155 --> 00:46:26.616
Yeah.

434
00:46:29.357 --> 00:46:31.423
You should see
the look on your face.

435
00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:34.327
I had you there
for a minute.
didn't I?

436
00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:37.869
No. no.

437
00:46:37.904 --> 00:46:42.005
This here is none other
than the great
Alistair Edgar.

438
00:46:43.338 --> 00:46:45.734
Man that saved
this town.

439
00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:50.442
See. when our ancestors
first settled this place.
it was...

440
00:46:51.346 --> 00:46:53.478
it was dire.

441
00:46:53.513 --> 00:46:55.986
Famine. disease.

442
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:58.813
The loss
of human life.
it was...

443
00:46:58.848 --> 00:47:00.650
it was unthinkable.

444
00:47:00.685 --> 00:47:05.820
To say it plainly.
this place was going
to hell in a handbag.

445
00:47:05.855 --> 00:47:07.162
That is. until

446
00:47:08.561 --> 00:47:12.365
Alistair found a way
to pull it up
out of the mud

447
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.631
with his own
fair hands.

448
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:17.799
Now. this portrait
was a gift from Alistair
to the town.

449
00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:22.012
But if you ask me.
real gift was
Alistair himself.

450
00:47:22.047 --> 00:47:24.311
You can't imagine
how inspiring it is
for me

451
00:47:24.346 --> 00:47:26.214
to wake up
every morning.

452
00:47:26.249 --> 00:47:28.117
first thing I see
is that man's face.

453
00:47:30.583 --> 00:47:32.385
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

454
00:47:35.962 --> 00:47:38.193
I've seen other paintings
just like this.

455
00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:42.494
I swear it's the same guy
in every single one.

456
00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:46.696
He's...
He's always referred to
as "The Visitor."

457
00:47:48.568 --> 00:47:51.305
I mean. could it be
that it's Alistair
in every one?

458
00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.114
Genesis- 27.

459
00:47:59.348 --> 00:48:01.843
"God created man
in his own image.

460
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.813
in the image of God

461
00:48:05.486 --> 00:48:07.189
he created him."

462
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.818
What does that mean?

463
00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.754
Right.

464
00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:14.262
Bible verses
aren't your thing.

465
00:48:14.297 --> 00:48:16.693
How about this?

466
00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:19.003
There can never
be too much
of a good thing.

467
00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:23.898
I would just take it
as a sign.

468
00:48:23.933 --> 00:48:27.275
You are where
you are meant to be.

469
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.211
And you know what?

470
00:48:29.246 --> 00:48:31.411
I think maybe it's time
for you to get
that young Maia home.

471
00:48:31.446 --> 00:48:33.050
She needs her rest.

472
00:48:33.085 --> 00:48:34.348
Sure.
Yeah. you're right.

473
00:48:34.383 --> 00:48:36.350
Um. look.
I'm sorry.

474
00:48:36.385 --> 00:48:37.813
I didn't mean
to come into your--

475
00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.815
Stop right there.

476
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.027
You are welcome to go
anywhere you want to.
Robert.

477
00:48:43.986 --> 00:48:46.624
We're just so glad
that you are back.

478
00:48:51.103 --> 00:48:52.960
<i> I still cannot believe</i>
<i>you went in his bedroom.</i>

479
00:48:52.995 --> 00:48:54.863
He had one
of those paintings.

480
00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:56.700
Again with the paintings.
He said his name
was Alistair Edgar.

481
00:48:56.735 --> 00:48:58.042
Robert. please.
you promised--

482
00:48:58.077 --> 00:48:59.934
He said he was
the founder of your town.

483
00:49:01.443 --> 00:49:03.113
Alistair Edgar?

484
00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:06.809
Alistair Edgar
was born in the 1700s.

485
00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:09.449
So unless you have
a time machine
that I'm not aware of.

486
00:49:09.484 --> 00:49:10.978
I don't know
what to tell you.
Robert.

487
00:49:11.013 --> 00:49:12.584
I know I'm starting
to sound crazy.

488
00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:14.652
but this is really.
really beginning to--

489
00:49:14.687 --> 00:49:16.753
Oh. God.

490
00:50:09.412 --> 00:50:10.477
Hey.

491
00:50:11.744 --> 00:50:13.480
Oh. Hey.

492
00:50:13.515 --> 00:50:15.042
Where you going?

493
00:50:15.077 --> 00:50:17.715
I'm just off to. uh.
a doctor's appointment.

494
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.223
Oh. Oh.
I didn't-didn't realize.

495
00:50:20.258 --> 00:50:22.159
No. it's not. uh.
anything important.

496
00:50:22.194 --> 00:50:23.391
It's just
a quick checkup.

497
00:50:23.426 --> 00:50:24.986
So I'm fine.
Oh. You sure?

498
00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:27.021
Yeah. Just wanted
to do this alone.

499
00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:29.397
if that's okay.
Okay.

500
00:50:29.432 --> 00:50:30.497
Bye.

501
00:51:04.027 --> 00:51:05.730
Hello.

502
00:51:05.765 --> 00:51:07.765
<i>Mr. Burrows.</i>
<i>I presume?</i>

503
00:51:09.802 --> 00:51:11.571
Yeah. speaking.

504
00:51:11.606 --> 00:51:13.067
<i>You're alone.</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

505
00:51:14.675 --> 00:51:16.004
Yeah. I'm alone.

506
00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.280
Who is this?

507
00:51:17.315 --> 00:51:19.073
<i>Let that be</i>
<i>your first lesson.</i>

508
00:51:19.108 --> 00:51:21.977
<i>In the town of Briar Glen.</i>
<i>you. sir. are never alone.</i>

509
00:51:23.618 --> 00:51:25.288
Okay.
thanks for that.
I'm gonna hang up.

510
00:51:25.323 --> 00:51:26.586
<i>No. Wait.</i>

511
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.655
What is it?

512
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.790
<i>I want you to come</i>
<i>to the window</i>

513
00:51:32.825 --> 00:51:34.891
<i>on the far east side</i>
<i>of your house.</i>

514
00:51:34.926 --> 00:51:36.398
<i>Look outside.</i>

515
00:51:36.433 --> 00:51:37.762
I'm really not
in the mood. okay?

516
00:51:37.797 --> 00:51:39.929
<i>I assure you</i>
<i>I am deadly serious.</i>

517
00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:42.602
<i>Just ask</i>
<i>our mutual acquaintance.</i>

518
00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:44.142
<i>The Visitor.</i>

519
00:52:14.504 --> 00:52:16.966
My. my.

520
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:18.605
Will you look
at that?

521
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.805
It really is uncanny.
isn't it?

522
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.139
Maxwell Braun.

523
00:52:25.174 --> 00:52:27.185
Purveyor of fine arts
and antiquities.

524
00:52:28.287 --> 00:52:30.782
Please get in
before anyone sees us.

525
00:52:30.817 --> 00:52:34.049
Yeah. I... I don't think
I'm gonna do that. Thanks.

526
00:52:35.261 --> 00:52:36.689
You want answers.
don't you?

527
00:52:39.595 --> 00:52:41.331
It's now or never.

528
00:52:47.229 --> 00:52:49.438
I call this
"The Visitor series."

529
00:52:51.904 --> 00:52:54.410
This is the first one
that caught my eye.

530
00:52:54.445 --> 00:52:56.170
I was shopping
a collection in Germany.

531
00:52:56.205 --> 00:52:58.909
mostly pieces
from the '30s and '40s.

532
00:52:58.944 --> 00:53:01.945
around the time
of the Second World War.

533
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.915
It was completely buried
amongst the morass.

534
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.148
But something about it
called to me.

535
00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.491
If I'm honest.
I think it was
'cause I thought

536
00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:10.888
you were easy
on the eyes.

537
00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:13.561
Or he was.

538
00:53:13.596 --> 00:53:15.497
Whatever.
You get my point.

539
00:53:15.532 --> 00:53:17.158
Anyway...

540
00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:19.501
...I purchased it
to add to my collection.

541
00:53:19.536 --> 00:53:21.965
then after some time.
it faded from memory.

542
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.066
That is.
until a few years later

543
00:53:25.102 --> 00:53:26.574
when I came across this.

544
00:53:36.245 --> 00:53:38.179
All right. this is...

545
00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.983
this is really starting
to creep me out now.

546
00:53:40.018 --> 00:53:43.558
These are just
the tip of the iceberg.

547
00:53:44.792 --> 00:53:47.265
Congo during
Leopold's brutal reign.

548
00:53:48.565 --> 00:53:49.894
Cambodian genocide

549
00:53:49.929 --> 00:53:51.731
during the 1970s.

550
00:53:52.767 --> 00:53:54.437
It became an obsession.

551
00:53:54.472 --> 00:53:58.969
Mining collections.
libraries. museums.
estate sales.

552
00:53:59.004 --> 00:54:02.940
Uncovering hundreds of photos.
all of them featuring

553
00:54:02.975 --> 00:54:04.711
this same man.

554
00:54:04.746 --> 00:54:07.241
And each of them
corresponding to moments
in human history

555
00:54:07.276 --> 00:54:09.518
we wish
we could forget.

556
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:14.215
Is his name Alistair?

557
00:54:15.757 --> 00:54:18.395
I spent years trying
to ascertain his identity.

558
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:19.462
To no avail.

559
00:54:20.289 --> 00:54:21.794
Nearly drove me mad.

560
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:24.566
Then one frustrating
drunken night.

561
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:26.898
I stumbled across
an online forum

562
00:54:26.933 --> 00:54:31.067
dedicated to rare
and forgotten
contemporary art.

563
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.510
That's where I met
Margaret Delacroix.

564
00:54:37.108 --> 00:54:40.076
From the antique store.
Yeah.

565
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:42.276
She tumbled down
this rabbit hole
years before me.

566
00:54:42.311 --> 00:54:44.619
Along with a group
of like-minded
individuals.

567
00:54:44.654 --> 00:54:47.985
she made
significant strides
towards discovering

568
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.153
the insidious truth
behind this man's
identity.

569
00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:55.960
And for that.
she paid the ultimate price.

570
00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:03.506
She died?

571
00:55:10.449 --> 00:55:11.679
So who is he?

572
00:55:13.375 --> 00:55:16.387
He is both you
and not you. Robert.

573
00:55:20.822 --> 00:55:22.525
What does that
even mean?

574
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.528
It means you're still
in control
of your own destiny.

575
00:55:25.563 --> 00:55:27.794
You can decide.

576
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:30.632
But just know
that decision will have
graver repercussions

577
00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:32.359
than you could ever
possibly fathom.

578
00:55:32.394 --> 00:55:35.703
Can you just please
just stop talking to me
in riddles?

579
00:55:35.738 --> 00:55:36.968
What decision?

580
00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:40.609
Just tell me.
honestly and clearly.

581
00:55:40.644 --> 00:55:42.138
what the fuck
is going on?

582
00:55:46.749 --> 00:55:48.947
This is not
your home. Robert.

583
00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:50.685
These people
are not your friends.

584
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.017
And if you're being
honest with yourself.

585
00:55:53.052 --> 00:55:55.657
I think you know
that already.

586
00:55:55.692 --> 00:55:58.253
Their gain is not only
your loss.

587
00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:00.530
but the rest
of the world's loss
as well.

588
00:56:00.565 --> 00:56:03.159
But you can
still leave.

589
00:56:03.194 --> 00:56:04.864
Go back to London.
or better yet.

590
00:56:04.899 --> 00:56:06.965
find somewhere
even more remote

591
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
where nobody can
possibly find you.

592
00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:12.069
By all means.
be happy.

593
00:56:12.104 --> 00:56:14.973
Use this money
to create and live
a comfortable life.

594
00:56:15.008 --> 00:56:17.041
Just live it
anonymously.

595
00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:21.243
What about my wife?

596
00:56:21.278 --> 00:56:22.948
We're expecting a son.
I can't just leave.

597
00:56:24.248 --> 00:56:25.555
A boy.

598
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:28.723
This is even more urgent
than I thought.

599
00:56:28.758 --> 00:56:30.989
What has my son
got to do with this?

600
00:56:31.024 --> 00:56:33.860
You. your son
and every male heir
in your bloodline

601
00:56:33.895 --> 00:56:36.896
from here until eternity
will be affected

602
00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:38.832
by the choice
you make. Robert.

603
00:56:38.867 --> 00:56:42.132
Go. and be the good man
you were raised to be.

604
00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:45.168
Or stay and end up
in one of these photos.

605
00:56:45.203 --> 00:56:49.205
Stay and become
The Visitor.

606
00:57:48.497 --> 00:57:51.003
<i> Robert?</i>

607
00:57:53.205 --> 00:57:54.512
Robert.

608
00:58:02.148 --> 00:58:03.521
Robert!

609
00:58:14.864 --> 00:58:16.534
Been thinking
a lot recently.

610
00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:21.528
What with the baby coming.
everything that's going on
with these paintings--

611
00:58:21.563 --> 00:58:22.969
Again with
the paintings.

612
00:58:23.004 --> 00:58:24.938
I think we should move
back to London.

613
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:29.206
Excuse me?

614
00:58:29.241 --> 00:58:32.979
Something is off
about this place. Maia.

615
00:58:33.014 --> 00:58:36.312
Maybe you don't see it
because you grew up here.

616
00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:37.984
Maybe you blocked it out.

617
00:58:38.756 --> 00:58:41.119
But I don't feel safe.

618
00:58:41.154 --> 00:58:44.518
Why? Because you bear
a passing resemblance
to a man in a painting?

619
00:58:44.553 --> 00:58:46.421
Yes. Actually. that.

620
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:51.063
Since we got here.
there have been
real consequences.

621
00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:52.229
People have died.

622
00:58:52.264 --> 00:58:53.736
Who?

623
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:56.068
Margaret Delacroix.
the lady from the art shop.

624
00:58:56.103 --> 00:58:58.807
And what about Kathy?
One minute. she's here.
the next minute. she's gone.

625
00:58:58.842 --> 00:58:59.907
I'm sure Kathy is fine.
Poof.

626
00:58:59.942 --> 00:59:02.305
And no one
seems to care!

627
00:59:03.649 --> 00:59:05.880
What if we're next?

628
00:59:05.915 --> 00:59:08.080
Do you know how crazy
this sounds. Robert?

629
00:59:08.115 --> 00:59:11.116
Why? Because I want
to raise my child
in a place that feels safe?

630
00:59:11.151 --> 00:59:13.283
No. what's crazy
is that after we've taken
all of our stuff

631
00:59:13.318 --> 00:59:15.384
halfway across the world.
now you're pulling this shit?

632
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:17.221
I'm not pulling
anything.

633
00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.697
I met a guy today.
said his name
was Maxwell Braun.

634
00:59:20.732 --> 00:59:23.733
Maxwell Braun?
That's what this is about?
He's famously insane!

635
00:59:23.768 --> 00:59:25.394
He had information.
He showed me photos.

636
00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:26.901
What about me?

637
00:59:27.871 --> 00:59:28.936
What about
what I want?

638
00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:31.708
This is my home. Robert.

639
00:59:31.743 --> 00:59:37.076
And for once in my life.
it's starting to feel
like my home.

640
00:59:37.111 --> 00:59:39.111
I'm not gonna give that up
over some fucking delusion.

641
00:59:39.146 --> 00:59:41.949
This is not
a fucking delusion.

642
00:59:41.984 --> 00:59:43.148
Okay?

643
00:59:58.495 --> 00:59:59.769
You can go to London.

644
01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:06.039
You'll be going alone.

645
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:51.573
Family. hearth.

646
01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.509
straw and stone.

647
01:01:58.857 --> 01:02:00.153
Start anew.

648
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.316
<i>Robert. it's Maxwell.</i>

649
01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:11.922
<i>I received your message.</i>

650
01:04:11.957 --> 01:04:14.518
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>at our meeting place</i>
<i>as you requested.</i>

651
01:04:14.553 --> 01:04:16.784
<i>but I can't stay here</i>
<i>much longer.</i>

652
01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:19.556
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what these people</i>
<i>are capable of.</i>

653
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:20.854
<i>Please hurry.</i>

654
01:04:22.924 --> 01:04:25.595
<i>Where have you been?</i>

655
01:05:12.281 --> 01:05:13.544
Mr. Braun?

656
01:07:40.693 --> 01:07:41.923
Maia!

657
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.762
Maia!

658
01:07:51.242 --> 01:07:52.373
Maia?

659
01:07:58.645 --> 01:07:59.809
Maia?

660
01:09:20.562 --> 01:09:21.990
He never loved me.

661
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:25.862
Maia?

662
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.194
Who is this?

663
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.635
He wanted a son.

664
01:09:30.539 --> 01:09:32.000
He needed a son.

665
01:09:33.938 --> 01:09:36.103
I wanted to tell you
for so long.

666
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.173
But Pastor Ellis
convinced me
you weren't ready.

667
01:09:43.783 --> 01:09:45.178
Not ready for what?

668
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.623
Maia. who the fuck
is this?

669
01:09:52.726 --> 01:09:54.891
Edgar Cartwell Eden.

670
01:10:01.372 --> 01:10:02.734
Our father.

671
01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.345
Look. I know it's a lot
to take in. Robert.

672
01:10:10.546 --> 01:10:12.843
But it is time
that you hear the truth.

673
01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:24.294
<i>You were kidnapped. Robert.</i>

674
01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:47.174
<i> They smuggled you</i>
<i>to London. found you a family</i>
<i>far away from us.</i>

675
01:10:53.985 --> 01:10:55.721
<i>They tried to break the cycle.</i>

676
01:10:57.318 --> 01:10:59.725
Braun. Margaret.

677
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.430
Amongst others.

678
01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:02.893
But they got
what they deserved.

679
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.699
So you killed them?

680
01:11:10.606 --> 01:11:12.672
Oh. no. sweetheart.

681
01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:16.775
You did.

682
01:11:18.581 --> 01:11:21.549
Those aren't nightmares
you've been having.
are they. Robert?

683
01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:41.668
That's not me.

684
01:11:41.703 --> 01:11:43.164
That never happened.

685
01:11:55.486 --> 01:11:57.354
<i> Robert. you have</i>
<i>to stop fighting this.</i>

686
01:11:58.346 --> 01:12:00.489
Deep down.
you know what you are.

687
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.359
<i>Oh. no. please.</i>

688
01:12:13.394 --> 01:12:16.362
Oh. no.

689
01:12:16.397 --> 01:12:17.869
No. please.

690
01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:19.640
You don't have
to do this.

691
01:12:19.675 --> 01:12:23.039
<i>No. please.</i>
<i>Please. Please.</i>

692
01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:24.513
Please. Please.

693
01:12:27.518 --> 01:12:29.551
You're a light-bearer.
Robert.

694
01:12:30.983 --> 01:12:33.214
A vessel
for a greater power.

695
01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:36.492
Just like every
firstborn male in our family
since Alistair

696
01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:39.385
sacrificed his bloodline
for the people of this town.

697
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.661
No.

698
01:12:40.696 --> 01:12:42.223
No. this
isn't real.

699
01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:44.896
This is all
in my messed-up.
stupid fucking head.

700
01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:47.701
This is your privilege.

701
01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:50.099
Don't you understand?

702
01:12:50.134 --> 01:12:53.707
I was sent out
into the world
as a little girl

703
01:12:53.742 --> 01:12:55.676
to find you
and bring you home.

704
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:57.040
Took me years!

705
01:12:57.075 --> 01:13:00.340
I have sacrificed
so much for this family!

706
01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.012
Now it's your turn.

707
01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:14.255
I don't know
what these people
have been telling you

708
01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:18.028
or how they brainwashed you.
but you need to listen to me.

709
01:13:18.063 --> 01:13:20.635
I'm Robert. You're Maia.
We're married.

710
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:23.231
We were living
together in London.
and then your father--

711
01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:25.002
Our father.
Our father!
Your father--

712
01:13:25.037 --> 01:13:27.477
Your father passed away.
and now we're here

713
01:13:27.512 --> 01:13:29.908
in your childhood home.
and...

714
01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:39.720
You're-you're pregnant.

715
01:13:41.218 --> 01:13:43.889
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're pregnant?

716
01:13:48.896 --> 01:13:50.093
Our son...

717
01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:54.471
is our future.

718
01:13:59.137 --> 01:14:00.939
He was always
part of the plan.

719
01:14:00.974 --> 01:14:03.810
In London.
we were supposed
to have a little girl!

720
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:08.617
I did my part.

721
01:14:20.697 --> 01:14:22.598
What is that
supposed to mean?

722
01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:27.966
You needed a boy.

723
01:14:31.004 --> 01:14:32.575
You fuck--

724
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.477
Oh. fuck.

725
01:14:45.755 --> 01:14:47.656
Oh. what is
happening to me?

726
01:14:53.631 --> 01:14:55.664
You stopped taking
your medication.

727
01:15:00.528 --> 01:15:03.199
The herbs are beginning
to work. Hey. Robert.

728
01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.038
It's okay.

729
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.711
They're helping you
to transition.

730
01:15:15.147 --> 01:15:18.313
We can finally
be the family
we always wanted.

731
01:15:22.154 --> 01:15:25.485
Be who you were
always meant to be.

732
01:15:40.205 --> 01:15:42.271
Oh. my God.
I've so been duped.

733
01:15:45.848 --> 01:15:47.716
Do they sell
pecan pie here?

734
01:15:49.346 --> 01:15:51.819
Uh. no. I don't--
I don't think so.

735
01:15:51.854 --> 01:15:53.887
Yeah. I. uh...

736
01:15:53.922 --> 01:15:56.153
I asked this man
outside my hotel

737
01:15:56.188 --> 01:15:59.255
where in this city
I could get
a slice of pecan pie.

738
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:01.059
He gave me
this address.

739
01:16:01.094 --> 01:16:04.458
Yeah. I definitely think
he was pulling your leg.

740
01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.669
I think you
might be right there.

741
01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:09.199
Damn.

742
01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:12.136
Your first time
in London?

743
01:16:12.171 --> 01:16:14.941
That obvious?

744
01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:16.943
Yeah. there's not
a lot of pecan pie spots.

745
01:16:16.978 --> 01:16:18.505
No kidding.

746
01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:32.288
I'm Robert.
by the way.

747
01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:34.587
Robert.

748
01:16:35.766 --> 01:16:36.996
I'm Maia.

749
01:16:46.304 --> 01:16:47.677
Start anew!

750
01:16:47.712 --> 01:16:49.503
...when he takes his throne.

751
01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:53.474
Family. hearth.
straw and stone!

752
01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:57.148
Start anew
when he takes his throne!

753
01:16:57.183 --> 01:16:58.644
Family. hearth...

754
01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:01.581
Brothers and sisters.
we are saved.

755
01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:05.453
The Eden bloodline
will finally be restored.

756
01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:09.589
We humbly present our bodies
as a living sacrifice

757
01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:13.230
to he who came to us
in our time of need

758
01:17:13.265 --> 01:17:16.497
and offered us power.
purpose and hope.

759
01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:20.776
We invoke you
to awaken this vessel

760
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:24.813
to prepare Lucian.
he of purest Eden blood.

761
01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:26.881
to fulfill his destiny

762
01:17:26.916 --> 01:17:30.049
as the final prophecy
has foretold.

763
01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:31.952
...as he takes his throne.

764
01:17:31.987 --> 01:17:33.613
Family. hearth.
straw and stone.

765
01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:36.022
It is the last hour.

766
01:17:36.057 --> 01:17:38.959
the hour
when darkness reigns!

767
01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:42.963
Family. hearth.
straw and stone!

768
01:17:42.998 --> 01:17:45.163
He prepares the vessel!

769
01:17:45.198 --> 01:17:48.903
Family. hearth.
straw and stone...

770
01:17:48.938 --> 01:17:51.664
He makes
his way into this world!

Family. hearth.
straw and stone.

772
01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:55.173
He comes!

773
01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:58.011
Start anew
when he takes his throne.

774
01:17:59.707 --> 01:18:01.344
<i>Welcome home. boy.</i>

775
01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:21.804
Find him. Maia.

776
01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:45.894
Welcome. baby Lucian.

777
01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:49.766

We charge you now. Robert.

779
01:18:56.632 --> 01:19:02.372
that on your death.
he will become you

780
01:19:02.407 --> 01:19:06.178
and complete our dark lord's
work on this Earth.

781
01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:12.415
Take the throne.
Rise up now.
baby Lucian.

The chosen one.

784
01:19:16.553 --> 01:19:18.586
The long wait
is over.

785
01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:20.390
Your time is upon us.

786
01:19:20.425 --> 01:19:22.392
Take the throne.

787
01:19:22.427 --> 01:19:25.868
Take the throne.

Take the throne.

Take the throne.

793
01:20:37.535 --> 01:20:39.832
Will you
accept this honor. Robert?

794
01:22:24.642 --> 01:22:26.147
I'm off.

795
01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:27.610
I'll see you
in a few days.

796
01:22:39.591 --> 01:22:41.789
<i>Brothers and sisters.</i>

797
01:22:41.824 --> 01:22:44.363

798
01:22:45.498 --> 01:22:48.829
<i>It is a time of destruction.</i>

799
01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:51.172
<i>a time of renewal.</i>

800
01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:05.186

<i>like a shadow</i>
<i>over all the world.</i>

804
01:23:36.384 --> 01:23:38.351
<i>Blood.</i>

805
01:23:38.386 --> 01:23:42.718
<i>tears will spill forth</i>

807
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:53.795
<i>Engulfed in his unholy fire.</i>
