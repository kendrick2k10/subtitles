00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.000
- Haunted Houses tend
to be a main attraction

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.280
during Halloween season.

8
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.710
You enter a dark place.

9
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.590
you walk down a long hallway.

10
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.645
and you never know what
will be lurking about.

11
00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:00.120
(laughs)

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.860
What if you entered a contest.
(cat yowling)

13
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.570
and won an exclusive ticket

14
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
to the one night only Shadow's Edge?

15
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.715
Well that's what
tonight's feature's about.

We follow seven lucky winners

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.290
throughout their terrifying evening.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.003
but remember to follow the rules.

19
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.336
Now. enter at your own risk.

20
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.348
(somber music)

21
00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.392

("Monster Mash" by Bobby Pickett)

24
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.950
- Um. hi.

25
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.863
Can you get me some black
cream makeup out of the case?

26
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.167
- I don't work here.

27
00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:44.617
- But you have a name tag on.

28
00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:49.324
- No. I don't.

29
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.128
- [Evan] You're gonna
get fired. you know that?

30
00:02:57.128 --> 00:03:00.360
- Good. I can finally
get out of here. then.

31
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.160
- [Evan] How can you
hate this place so much?

32
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.810
This place is great.

33
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.327
I mean. look at that. those girls are hot.

34
00:03:06.327 --> 00:03:08.070
And that one's shorts are so short.

35
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.570
they might as well be called a belt.

36
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.403
- If you like it so much.

37
00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:13.380
why don't you come around
the counter and work for me.

38
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.090
- [Evan] All right. so
why do you work here?

39
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.620
Your love of Halloween?

40
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.110
- Hell no. Halloween
is the dumbest holiday.

41
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.120
I don't even know why people celebrate it.

42
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.730
It's like Easter. it looses
it's appeal once you get older.

43
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.690
- [Evan] What are you talking about?

44
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.490
Easter rocks.

45
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.560
My mom still hides eggs in our
back yard on Easter Sunday.

46
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.393
and I love it.

47
00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:32.070
Hell. I still color Easter eggs.

48
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.570
- It's a wonder you
don't have a girlfriend.

49
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.650
- [Evan] Hey. you're just jealous

50
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.040
'cause I can color some
pretty bad ass eggs.

51
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.440
- Yeah. well. I wish I had a
couple of those eggs right now.

52
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.990
There's a couple of people
I'd like to throw them at.

53
00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:45.304
- Am I one of them?

54
00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:46.971
- I'll let you know.

55
00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:50.280
- Hey. excuse me.

56
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.260
Um. is this where the contest winners

57
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.240
are supposed to meet for
the haunted house outside?

58
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.160
- Unfortunately. yes.

59
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.810
- Sweet.

60
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.420
Man. I've been looking
forward to this forever.

61
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.360
Halloween and horror
are my life. you know?

62
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.730
I've actually seen just
about every horror film

63
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.200
that you could possibly imagine.

64
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.680
I've been to. like. every
haunted house so far this year.

65
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.440
Now. I don't know what it
is about blood and guts.

66
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.990
but (sighs) just gets me excited.

67
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.703
- [Evan] Yeah. I can see that.

68
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.591
- [Vincent] Huh?

69
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.480
- (laughs) Evan.

70
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.800
I'm one of the contest winners. too.

71
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.270
- [Vincent] Oh. hey. how's it goin'?

72
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.103
Vincent.

73
00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:26.580
- So you're a horror buff. huh?

74
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.280
- Yeah. I actually drove
an hour to get here.

75
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.570
When I heard about this contest.

76
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.370
and knew that there was a chance

77
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.440
that I could spend the night
locked in a haunted house.

78
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.730
I just had to put my name
in this contest. you know?

79
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.540
So you got a ticket for this house?

80
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.740
- No. I don't believe
in that sort of thing.

81
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.640
- You don't believe in what sort of thing?

82
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.100
- Halloween. you know.
paying to go through

83
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.530
some cheesy plywood fun house.

84
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.750
watching people dress up
like their five years old.

85
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.650
stuff like that.

86
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.990
- So. uh. this must be like winning

87
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.190
the lottery for you. huh?

88
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.550
- Yeah. (sighs) my mom was
pissed when she found out

89
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.840
I entered in this contest.

90
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.450
You know. she thinks that
Halloween is for. like. misfits.

91
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.760
and. you know. people with
no time on their hands.

92
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.400
So if you ever see her.
don't tell her I'm here.

93
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.640
I told her I was staying at
a friend's house tonight.

94
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.463
- I'll be sure to keep my mouth shut.

95
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.423
- Oh. Christian.

96
00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:20.670
(Christian sighs)
(Evan snickering)

97
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.590
You wouldn't happen to know anything about

98
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.530
why a customer complained
about one of my employees

99
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.780
refusing to help them. and
taking their name tag off

100
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.220
right in front of them. would you?

101
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.520
- [Christian] No. I don't.

102
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.490
- Just out of curiosity.
uh. where is your name tag?

103
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.443
- Uh...

104
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.390
Must have fallen off.

105
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.300
- Mm-hmm. look Christian.

106
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.247
I know Halloween isn't
your favorite time of year.

107
00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.200
but the fact is that you're getting paid

108
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.760
to help the customers with their wants

109
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.770
and needs inside the store.

110
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.510
You're not getting paid
to lean on the counter.

111
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.740
and mope around.

112
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.043
You need to take a better
interest in your work.

113
00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:01.214
(Christian sighs)

114
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.600
- I bet if you showed a
little more enthusiasm.

115
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.190
you'd really start to enjoy your work.

116
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.200
and maybe even Halloween.

117
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.520
Every little positive thing you do

118
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.990
can really make a world of difference.

119
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.900
Not only for you. but for the customers.

120
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.970
Do you understand what I'm
trying to say. Christian?

121
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.803
- Yeah.

122
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.783
- Good.

123
00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:19.350
Well. as you may know.
I've been given the task

124
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.690
to work with The Shadow's
Edge Haunted House.

125
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.100
and I'll be in and out of the store

126
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.480
getting everything set up for tonight.

127
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.120
So I need you to be on your best behavior.

128
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.190
Can I count on you to do that?

129
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.023
- You bet.

130
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.050
- Hey. you're a lucky ticket holder.

131
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.190
- Yeah. I am!

132
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.611
- Slap it!

133
00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:39.875
- [Evan] All right!

134
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.443
(Nick mumbles excitedly)

135
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:44.110
(ominous music)

136
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.823
- How about him?

137
00:06:49.823 --> 00:06:50.793
- Ugh. no. ew.

138
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.940
- Come on. this is the only way

139
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.680
into the house. tonight. with me.

140
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.793
- I don't know.

141
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.260
- Just go over there. and
turn on that sex appeal

142
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.960
like I know you can. baby.

143
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.037
- I couldn't. he literally
looks like he would

144
00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.903
hump my leg. if he could.

145
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.360
- Look. listen. you said so yourself.

146
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.910
you want to come into this house with me

147
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.852
to have a little bit of. uh. fun.

148
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.350
So pop that chest out. lick those lips.

149
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.922
and. uh. seduce this
guy out of his ticket.

150
00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:24.303
- No. no. absolutely not.

151
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.383
- You serious?

152
00:07:27.383 --> 00:07:28.773
- Yeah.
- Fine. all right.

153
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.690
I'll do it. but you're
gonna have to appreciate me

154
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.040
a little bit more for this.

155
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.920
So my man. I notice you
got one of those tickets

156
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.150
into the house tonight.

157
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.420
Let's say I. uh. give you 20 bucks for it?

158
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.413
- No. no. man.

159
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.791
- How 'bout. uh...

160
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.830
How 'bout 40?

161
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.230
- Uh...
- 40 bucks.

162
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.570
- I really want to go to this house.

163
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.820
- Right. uh...

164
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.380
50. that's the highest.

165
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.030
50.
- No. man.

166
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.326
I just can't part with it.

167
00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:10.406
(sighs) Sorry.

168
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:12.480
- All right. all right. check it out.

169
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.340
You see that chick
standing right over there?

170
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.360
- [Creepy Guy] Yeah.

171
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.000
- [Eli] She will do anything you want.

172
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.230
If you want to dress her
up like a little boy.

173
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.280
lick some frosting off her. or something?

174
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.213
She'll do it.

175
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.040
- You know. honestly. though.

176
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.930
I don't find her all that attractive.

177
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.060
- What. are you serious?
(creepy guy stammering)

178
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.070
Are you a little dog
fucker. what the fuck?

179
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.903
- I don't.

180
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.391
(paper crinkling)
- Give me this.

181
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:40.308
- Hey. hey.

182
00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.060
(clapping)

183
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.560
- I knew you'd do better than me.

184
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.393
- Yeah. you just remember

185
00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.710
about the little appreciation
you told me about.

186
00:08:56.805 --> 00:08:58.023
- I still don't get it.

187
00:08:58.023 --> 00:08:59.100
- You don't get it?

188
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.330
How do you not get it?
- What nuts?

189
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.460
Like. I don't get it.
- The hell?

190
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.803
Like. what's the joke?
- Whoa.

191
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.193
- What are you looking at?

192
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.293
- Her.

193
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.170
- Hi. can I help you?

194
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.910
- Oh. no thanks.

195
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.430
- Okay. well. I'm here
whenever you need help.

196
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
- Thank you.

197
00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:25.540
- 'Scuse me. guys.

198
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.240
Be right back.

199
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.860
- What's he doin'?

200
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.363
- Thinkin' with his penis.

201
00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:37.508
- Don't get it. you don't need that stuff.

202
00:09:37.508 --> 00:09:38.700
- Excuse me?

203
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.200
- The clown makeup.

204
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.700
There's no way a gorgeous
girl like yourself

205
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.160
is gonna be covering her
pretty face with that garbage.

206
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.260
- Actually. I'm not here
for a Halloween costume.

207
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.390
I'm just here killing time.

208
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.183
- Oh. you got a hot date
next door at the cafe?

209
00:09:51.183 --> 00:09:53.015
- No. no.

210
00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:56.790
I actually won a contest
to spend the night

211
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.380
out in the haunted house.

212
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.080
- Oh. so you're a Halloween junkie.

213
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.290
- Hardly. my friend said it would be funny

214
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.530
to enter me into this contest.
and wouldn't you know.

215
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.863
my name was drawn. and I won.

216
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.640
I'm really not too typically optimistic.

217
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.670
but I thought it was worth
coming and checking out.

218
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.070
and maybe the joke'll be on
them. and I'll have a good time.

219
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:20.933
- [Christian] Yeah.

220
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.760
- What about you. are you here

221
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.870
looking for a Halloween costume?

222
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.860
- Me. no. I picked out
my costume weeks ago.

223
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.690
I'm actually here for
the haunted house. too.

224
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.680
I was chosen as a winner.

225
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.820
- Oh. really?

226
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.423
- Yeah. that haunted house
out there is. like. my heaven.

227
00:10:35.423 --> 00:10:37.920
- (laughs) Well. it looks like

228
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.450
we'll be spending the night together.

229
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.410
- [Christian] I'm sorry?

230
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.670
- Out in the haunted house?

231
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.493
- [Christian] Oh. right. of
corse that's what you meant.

232
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.760
- Well. I'm Abigail.

233
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.950
- Can I call you Abbie?
- Sure.

234
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.790
- [Christian] I'm Christian.

235
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.900
- Can I call you Chris?

236
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.831
- [Christian] Well. you
could. but I won't answer.

237
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:56.370
(laughing quietly)

238
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.645
- Nice to meet you. Christian.

239
00:10:57.645 --> 00:10:59.726
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.140
(both laugh nervously)

241
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.440
Well. I have to go take
care of a few things.

242
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.637
but I guess I'll see you out
in the house. in a little bit.

243
00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:07.886
- [Abbie] Yeah. I'll
see you in a little bit.

244
00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:08.886
- All right.

245
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.990
ta-ta.
- [Abbie] Bye.

246
00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:15.000
- Ta-ta?

247
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.833
- Hey. shut up.

248
00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.100
At least I talked to her.

249
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.133
- Yeah. but ta-ta?

250
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.150
All right. a question for you. Einstein.

251
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.110
are you planning on continuing

252
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.123
a conversation with her within the tent?

253
00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:27.930
- No. I'm gonna get inside.

254
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.550
- How?

255
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.383
- Give me your ticket.

256
00:11:30.383 --> 00:11:32.280
- Hell no. you don't even like Halloween.

257
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.870
- So. we're good friends. right?

258
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.070
I've done a lot for you.

259
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.014
- [Evan] Like what?

260
00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:38.430
- Um. (snaps) you remember that time

261
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.930
that you broke your mom's favorite vase?

262
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.280
I told her that I tripped and broke it.

263
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.113
I covered for you. man.

264
00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:43.410
- We were like eight years old.

265
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.288
and the next day you told my mom

266
00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:45.988
that I put you up to lying for me.

267
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.850
- Oh. come on. man.

268
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.750
I'll never ask you for anything again.

269
00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:54.660
- Fine.

270
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.343
Yeah. right. (laughs)

271
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.743
- Sorry. man. you'll have to
kill me to get this ticket.

272
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.857
- Fine. screw both of you.

273
00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:08.524
(Evan and Vincent laughing)

274
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.930
There's gotta be a way I
can get into that house.

275
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.490
- [Evan] Go talk to Nick.

276
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.290
- I don't think Nick likes
me very much. right now.

277
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.270
- Then you better go kiss some ass.

278
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.443
- Okay. I have never kissed anyone's ass.

279
00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:20.970
- Then you better skip kissing his ass.

280
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.097
and go straight for his crotch area.

281
00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:24.270
(Christian and Evan
conversing in the background)

282
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.950
- Do you have a ticket for this house?

283
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.450
- [Christian] Wish me luck.

284
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.760
- Why else would I be standing here?

285
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.783
- Touche. (laughs)

286
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:35.430
(clears throat) So I'm
thinking that you and I

287
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.190
should probably stick together
when we go inside this house.

288
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.500
just so. in case we get alone.

289
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.420
I mean. we are alone.

290
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.213
Because I don't want you to be alone.

291
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.500
- I prefer to be alone.

292
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.780
It's how I entered this
dark. lonely world.

293
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.560
and it's how I'm going to
leave this dark. lonely world.

294
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.940
- I've seen enough horror films to know

295
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.210
that you're as good as dead
if you're out by yourself.

296
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.660
You know. new place. all alone.

297
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.303
I'm just trying to look out for you.

298
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.430
What was your name?

299
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.230
- Raven.

300
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.063
- Raven. huh?

301
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.543
- Yeah. why?

302
00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:15.690
Do you have a problem with that?

303
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.560
- Oh. no. I just never
heard the name Raven before.

304
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.393
It's unique.

305
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.120
- Raven is the darkest bird out there.

306
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.500
but yet. has this purity about itself.

307
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.140
I like to feel like I'm a raven.

308
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.567
Dark and mysterious on the outside.

309
00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:40.770
but so knowledgeable and
powerful on the inside.

310
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.133
- You know. I know of a
couple porn stars named Raven.

311
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.893
- Well. I'm Vincent.

312
00:13:48.117 --> 00:13:51.450
- And I am Woodpecker.
because I like to peck at--

313
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.800
Ow!

314
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.330
- Well. anyways. I am getting very excited

315
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.460
to be going into this house with you.

316
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.410
You seem to be a very
beautiful and interesting girl.

317
00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:09.293
- A very interesting girl. (laughs)

318
00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:12.126
(traffic zooming)

319
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.130
- Excuse me.

320
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.740
Sorry. I'm looking for Cecil Smith.

321
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.983
I was told he's the guy
in charge of all this.

322
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.800
- House doesn't open til tomorrow.

323
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800
- Yeah. I know that.

324
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.780
- You. uh. one of those
contestant winner people?

325
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.880
- No. I'm from inside the store.

326
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.170
I was told I'd be out here to assist

327
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.793
with the sneak peak. tonight.

328
00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:40.709
(spits)

329
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.749
Thank you.

330
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:48.900
Oh. by the way. I really
like your costume.

331
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.733
What are you supposed to be. like.

332
00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:51.633
a dirty person from the South?

333
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.710
Sorry.

334
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.543
- Prick.

335
00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.993
- Mr. Smith.

336
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.810
Hi. Nick Mangelsens. I'm
one of the managers here.

337
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.820
I just wanted to welcome
you guys to our store.

338
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.653
and to our town.

339
00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.670
- I didn't know we had
a welcome crew for us.

340
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.701
Is there a reason why you're
looking at me like that?

341
00:15:12.701 --> 00:15:15.660
- Oh. no. I just didn't
expect you to have the accent.

342
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.340
- Oh. yes. God forbid an Englishman

343
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.540
charge of something
like this in the States.

344
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.100
Would you like me to get
you some tea and crumpets?

345
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.683
Would that make you feel better?

346
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.400
- Nothing was meant by it. I'm sorry.

347
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.890
- I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

348
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.987
You never know what to expect down here.

349
00:15:33.987 --> 00:15:36.150
- You really had me goin' there.

350
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.320
- Usually. we come into town.

351
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.520
and people look at us
as if we're murderers.

352
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.450
Excuse me a moment.

353
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.283
Waylon!

354
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.065
How many more times do I have to tell you

355
00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:48.764
to get off your ass and help around here?

356
00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:51.064
I've told you a hundred
times to do something!

357
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.720
I'm sorry about that.

358
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.650
- Quite all right.

359
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.750
- He's a little crazy.

360
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.593
Look. I appreciate your kindness.

361
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.710
but I have a full staff
who travel around me.

362
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.270
help me out.

363
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.423
I really don't think I
have any use for you.

364
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.520
- Well. just look at me as your assistant.

365
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.280
If you need a water. just say.
"Hey. Nick. get me a water."

366
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.930
You know. if you want me to
dress up in a werewolf costume.

367
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.060
and hide inside of the house.
and jump out and scare people.

368
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.800
just say the word and I'll do it.

369
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.483
Your wish is my command.

370
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.731
- Oh. what the hell.

371
00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:25.807
Welcome aboard.

372
00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:27.184
- Excellent!

373
00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:29.790
Is there anything you
need right now. Mr. Smith?

374
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.083
- No. and call me Cecil.

375
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.777
I think I'm fine. thank you.

376
00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:36.450
- All right. well then. I
guess I'll head back inside.

377
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.710
and gather up the contestant winners.

378
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.600
and fill them in on things. and. uh.

379
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.070
we'll see you at sundown?

380
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.570
- [Cecil] That you will.

381
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.920
- See you then.

382
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.890
Oh. and remember. if you
need anything at all.

383
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.823
just shout for me.

384
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.590
Christian. what are you doing out here?

385
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.480
You need to be inside helping customers.

386
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.896
- Sorry. Nick. but
this'll only take a sec.

387
00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:58.699
- (sighs) What is it. Christian?

388
00:16:58.699 --> 00:16:59.760
I'm kinda in a hurry. here.

389
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.890
- Well. I was thinking about
what you told me about.

390
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.960
you know. taking more of
an interest in my work.

391
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.120
and Halloween. and whatnot.

392
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.710
So I thought. um. maybe I could

393
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.030
help out in the haunted house tonight.

394
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.220
you know. just as an extra set of hands.

395
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.060
I really think it could help me

396
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.810
get more into the Halloween spirit.

397
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.113
- Why do I have the feeling

398
00:17:18.113 --> 00:17:19.029
you're setting me up for something?

399
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.862
- I'm not!

400
00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:22.650
I really think that this whole
haunted house thing is cool.

401
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.850
and I should embrace it.

402
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.003
- I don't know.

403
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.330
Well. you see that guy over there?

404
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.490
- Yeah.
- That's Cecil Smith.

405
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.260
He's the owner of this place.

406
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.720
He'd be the guy to make
a decision like that.

407
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.040
Go talk to him.

408
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.630
- Thanks. Nick.

409
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.680
- Oh. hey. Christian.

410
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.580
- [Christian] Yeah?

411
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.763
- Feels good getting into the
Halloween season. doesn't it?

412
00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:46.279
(Christian sighs)

413
00:17:49.312 --> 00:17:51.979
(gate dragging)

414
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.713
- So. this your baby. huh?

415
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.600
The house. I mean.

416
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.890
You own it?

417
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.240
- Something like that. yes.

418
00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:09.810
Do I know you?

419
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.024
- No. actually. I work inside the store.

420
00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:16.110
and I was curious about
this haunted house-thing.

421
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.000
and my manager sent me out here

422
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.760
to see if you could use any help.

423
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.133
- [Cecil] My. this store
is pretty friendly.

424
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.703
- So. is that a yes or a no on me helping.

425
00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:32.670
- I have a full staff.

426
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.100
I really don't want or
need a bunch of people

427
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.903
walking around inside here tonight.

428
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.833
Something could get broken. or worse.

429
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.030
Someone could get hurt.

430
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.510
It's the last thing I need at this point.

431
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.760
(ominous music)
It's a big enough risk

432
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.200
opening this thing up to the public.

433
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.300
with some of the things that we do inside.

434
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.430
It's only a matter of time

435
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.180
before someone gets seriously hurt.

436
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.960
I've actually been quite lucky

437
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.870
that no one has gotten hurt. so far.

438
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.940
- I promise I'll be careful.

439
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.500
- You're word means nothing to me.

440
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.614
considering I only met you a minute ago.

441
00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:09.090
- (sighs) You gotta let me in.

442
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.787
- Why do I gotta let you in?

443
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.480
- Halloween is my favorite holiday.

444
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.370
It's like my Christmas.

445
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.480
I work inside the store.

446
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.070
so I wasn't able to enter the contest

447
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.510
for the sneak peak tonight.

448
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.500
It's not fair.

449
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.270
Just 'cause I work inside the store.

450
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.490
and surround myself with
Halloween. and what I love.

451
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.200
I don't get to have fun
when something this amazing

452
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.600
comes to town for one night?

453
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.343
- Look. kid.

454
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.693
if I let you in.

455
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.570
then I'd have to let in
everyone who asked me

456
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.790
if they could come inside the house.

457
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.740
It's just not fair.

458
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.523
Wait.

459
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.353
I guess it wouldn't hurt to
let you inside here. tonight.

460
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.339
We'll just act like you're
one of the VIP ticket holders.

461
00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:53.319
(Christian laughs)

462
00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:54.558
It could be our little secret.

463
00:19:54.558 --> 00:19:56.223
- This is so awesome. thank you!

464
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.678
- But you can't tell
anyone that I let you in.

465
00:19:59.678 --> 00:20:01.710
- [Christian] I promise. I won't.

466
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.390
- I'm being serious.

467
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.273
If you tell anyone. then
I'll have to kill you.

468
00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:11.190
(Christian laughs and stammers)

469
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.050
- [Christian] Good one.

470
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.003
- Well. um...

471
00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:16.710
- [Christian] Oh. um. Christian.

472
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.173
- Christian. it was nice meeting you.

473
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.593
- [Christian] Nice to meet you.

474
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.730
- But I have to get some work done

475
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.720
before I let you guys in here tonight.

476
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.660
- Right.

477
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.493
- Remember.

478
00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:34.770
(old instrumental music)

479
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.610
- So?

480
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.600
- I'm in.

481
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.010
- How'd you manage that?

482
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.840
- Can I have all the contestant winners

483
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.193
gather over by me. please.

484
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.510
Greetings. everyone.

485
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.860
I'll be one of your
hosts for this evening.

486
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.073
My name is Nicolas van Man-ghoul-sens.

487
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.820
and before we go inside the haunted house.

488
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.920
there are a few rules to go over.

489
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.433
No one is to touch
anything inside the house.

490
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.130
and everyone is to stay
together. unless told otherwise.

491
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.150
You wander away from the group.

492
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.033
you're likely to have the
blood sucked from your neck.

493
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.180
I need everyone to sign
these release forms

494
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.740
before we go inside.

495
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.360
- What for?

496
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.220
- Because once inside. we are the property

497
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.260
of The Shadow's Edge. and all the living

498
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.763
and non-living things inside.

499
00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:26.280
If they want to eat your brains.

500
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.730
they're more than welcome to.

501
00:21:30.837 --> 00:21:31.920
Now I'll need everyone to write legibly.

502
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.050
and have your IDs ready
before we go inside.

503
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.183
so we know you're giving us the real name.

504
00:21:35.183 --> 00:21:37.410
and not some phony made up name.

505
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.060
- Kind of like your phony made up name.

506
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.523
Nicolas van Man-ghoul-sens.

507
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.990
- Everyone take the next few moments

508
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.190
to fill out these forms.

509
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.713
Oh. and one more thing.

510
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.490
Once inside. the exits
will be padlocked shut.

511
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.183
and there will be no way out.

512
00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:56.370
Everyone will be locked inside

513
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.113
with all the demonic
creatures. (laughs maniacally)

514
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.730
- I don't know if I can stand
being trapped in the house

515
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.707
with that guy all night long.

516
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.600
- Maybe you're the one with the problem.

517
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.800
- By the way. I wanted to ask you.

518
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.687
what are you gonna put down
as your name on your sheet?

519
00:22:19.687 --> 00:22:21.837
- My name. Raven.

520
00:22:21.837 --> 00:22:26.837
- Oh. oh. I'm sorry. I
thought it was Crow. my bad.

521
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.780
- What name are you putting down?

522
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.613
Dicklicker?

523
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.803
- Funny. very. very funny.

524
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.990
- So can I borrow that pen
when you're done with it?

525
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.890
- Sure.

526
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.723
- Thanks.

527
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.380
So did you drive yourself. today?

528
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.260
Or did a friend drop you
off. like. a girlfriend.

529
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.670
or a guy friend.

530
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.080
- I drove myself.

531
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.330
- [Christian] Cool. cool.

532
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.751
So do you live with yourself.

533
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:02.370
(Abbie laughing)
or you know. with a friend.

534
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.570
or maybe somebody who's
more than a friend? (laughs)

535
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.743
What. what's so funny?

536
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.470
- Why don't you just ask me?

537
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.303
- [Christian] Ask you what?

538
00:23:11.303 --> 00:23:12.900
- If I have a boyfriend?

539
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.760
Isn't that where this really uncomfortable

540
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.500
conversation is leading to?

541
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.023
- No. it's just. it...

542
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.153
Fine. do you have a boyfriend?

543
00:23:22.098 --> 00:23:23.460
- No.

544
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.393
No. not right now.

545
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.600
Most guys. these days. are
just looking for a free ride.

546
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.900
- [Christian] A free ride?

547
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.967
Oh. right. I get it.

548
00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:35.130
- But I'm not that kind of girl.

549
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.950
I like to make a guy
work for my affections.

550
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.650
- [Christian] There's
nothing wrong with that.

551
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.300
- Well. I'm not like most girls.

552
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.150
- [Christian] I can see that.

553
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.760
Most girls wouldn't go
through something like this.

554
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.210
Really shows you're willing
to try anything once.

555
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.730
- Yeah. I feel like I'm
like that most of the time.

556
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.220
- [Christian] Maybe we
could hang out some time.

557
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.443
I'd like to put that theory to the test.

558
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.763
- I think I'd like that.

559
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.510
(clears throat) Here's the
pen you wanted to borrow.

560
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.910
- [Christian] Oh. thanks.

561
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.377
- I'm gonna go turn this is in.

562
00:24:10.377 --> 00:24:11.970
Um. I'll see you in a bit?

563
00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:12.866
- [Christian] See you soon.

564
00:24:12.866 --> 00:24:13.699
- Bye.

565
00:24:18.186 --> 00:24:19.798
(ominous music)

566
00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:20.631
(gate creaks)

567
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:22.020
- Right this way. everyone.

568
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.910
Get excited. say trick or treat!

569
00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.038
- Trick or shut the fuck up!

570
00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:29.288
(laughing)

571
00:24:30.152 --> 00:24:32.819
(gate creaking)

572
00:24:34.332 --> 00:24:37.082
(metal chinking)

573
00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:44.966
(ominous music)
(footsteps)

574
00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:50.361
It smells like wood in here.

575
00:24:57.618 --> 00:25:00.035
(door slams)

576
00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:06.003
(lock rattling)

577
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:12.842
(Halloween sound effects)

578
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:17.340
- Welcome. everyone. to the study room.

579
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.203
Please. come in. come in.

580
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:21.893
- This looks like something

581
00:25:21.893 --> 00:25:23.793
out of a children's public access show.

582
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.920
- Don't touch anything.

583
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.420
- [Christian] Okay. I'm sorry.

584
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.470
- Damn fools have no manners. whatsoever.

585
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.063
- Okay. I said I was sorry.

586
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.000
- Hey. Vincent. I think I
found the perfect mate for you.

587
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.443
- I think I found my perfect mate.

588
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.860
- Please. there's no such
thing as a perfect mate.

589
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.160
Only someone that you can
tolerate to grow old with.

590
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.200
that doesn't make you want
to go on a shooting rampage.

591
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.170
and kill everything and everyone in sight.

592
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.900
When it's all over. you lay next to them.

593
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.543
and rot together underneath
the Earth's surface.

594
00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:30.300
(Vincent laughs)

595
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.000
- I love your idea of pillow talk.

596
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:34.997
(Raven sighs)

597
00:26:34.997 --> 00:26:35.830
(Sasha laughs)

598
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.870
- Come on. babe.

599
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.400
- Where are we going?

600
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.430
- Let's go find a little
place where we can. uh...

601
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.170
Hmm?
(Sasha laughs)

602
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.808
- Maybe we should wait a little bit.

603
00:26:44.808 --> 00:26:46.200
(Eli sighs)

604
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.760
Come on. we've got all night.

605
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.980
- But I don't want to wait.

606
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.510
Besides. I know how you get.

607
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.343
- What?

608
00:26:52.343 --> 00:26:53.176
- You're gonna get tired.

609
00:26:53.176 --> 00:26:54.816
and you're not gonna
be in the mood anymore.

610
00:26:54.816 --> 00:26:57.780
- I'm not really in the
mood right now. anyways.

611
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.410
- Why. because of the company?

612
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.613
- Well. kinda.

613
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.393
- Well. what is it?

614
00:27:14.237 --> 00:27:15.210
- Eli. don't.

615
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.680
- No. he's staring my girl down.

616
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.820
- Come on. don't--

617
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.190
- I ain't gonna let him stare
my girl down. like that.

618
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.140
- I promise. if you don't. I'll
do that one thing you like.

619
00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:27.875
(laughs) You know. when I...

620
00:27:29.021 --> 00:27:29.854
- Go on.

621
00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:34.800
Can I get a hell. yeah?
(Sasha laughing)

622
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.883
- Hell. yeah!

623
00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:39.522
(Sasha laughing)

624
00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:50.340
- Hey!
(metal thuds)

625
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.303
God damn it!

626
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.660
Don't you fucking kids listen?

627
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.070
- But it's just a cup.

628
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.270
- And you're just a dumb broad.

629
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.970
- Hey. leave her alone.

630
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.080
- What did you say. boy?

631
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.700
- I said. leave her alone.

632
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.494
- Or what?

633
00:28:04.494 --> 00:28:06.798
- I'll. I'll--
- Christian...

634
00:28:06.798 --> 00:28:08.014
- Enough. Waylon.

635
00:28:08.014 --> 00:28:11.514
(Halloween sound effects)

636
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.363
- They were touching things. boss.

637
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.043
- Waylon. we've been over
this a hundred times.

638
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.770
you have no say in anything
that goes on around here.

639
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.163
You are my employee.

640
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.447
and you will listen to what I have to say.

641
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:35.147
Now put the cup back on the shelf.

642
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.210
and go and stand over in
the corner until I need you.

643
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.043
- Yes. sir.

644
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.290
- I'm sorry about that. everyone.

645
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.143
Waylon sometimes gets a big head.

646
00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.530
Hey. Christian. how are you?

647
00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:05.970
Let me be the first to welcome you all

648
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.760
inside The Shadow's Edge Haunted House.

649
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.023
My name is Cecil Smith.

650
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.910
Have they all signed the forms?

651
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.782
- Yeah. yeah. I have them right here.

652
00:29:15.782 --> 00:29:18.532
(paper rustling)

653
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.743
- Good. good.

654
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.713
We chose one lucky town
to come to to set up.

655
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.850
A lot of people ask us

656
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.863
why we only have it open for one night.

657
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.800
Why set up this tent. and go
through all that hard work

658
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.513
for one night a town?

659
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.453
Well. quite frankly. that's
all the time we need.

660
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.010
It only takes a few hours for everyone

661
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.363
to have the life scared out of them.

662
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.203
This is no ordinary haunted
house. this house is special.

663
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.000
The things that we do inside this house

664
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.143
mess with your minds.

665
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.880
You don't know what is real.

666
00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:17.313
or what is fake.

667
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.253
The blood that stains
these walls. these floors.

668
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.213
is it real?

669
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.003
Is it fake?

670
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.570
Let your minds decide.

671
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.833
People outside waiting to come through.

672
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.803
hear the screams from within.

673
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.840
and they don't know what to think.

674
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.980
Should they call for help?

675
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.820
Should they run away in fear.

676
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.140
that they could be the next
to possibly fall victim

677
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.623
to The Shadow's Edge?

678
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.663
Now some of you may be asking yourselves.

679
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.573
hey. Cecil. why is it
called The Shadow's Edge?

680
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.540
Because that's where the freaks play.

681
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.740
That's where reality and nightmares meet

682
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.640
to create a world so terrifying

683
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.390
that you don't know if this is real life.

684
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.263
or just fake.

685
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.433
Sure. you can scream for help.

686
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.380
Scream all you want.

687
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:42.303
but the truth is. you chose
to be part of this contest.

688
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.033
Now that you've won. you're
part of this nightmare.

689
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.390
There is no way out for you.

690
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.933
You're locked in.

691
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.133
Locked in with the freaks.

692
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.733
Freaks that have only
one thing on their minds.

693
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.143
torture.

694
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.083
I see by your faces that it's
all ready starting to set in.

695
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.343
Fear is in your mind.

696
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.617
Well before you have a
chance to ease your minds.

697
00:32:22.617 --> 00:32:24.167
let me remind you of something.

698
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.380
this is new territory for you.

699
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.336
You don't know what is behind that door.

700
00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:37.523
You have no idea what is
lurking in the shadows.

701
00:32:39.553 --> 00:32:42.303
All you know is that you are mice

702
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.133
in this maze that I have created.

703
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:52.588
This will be the most
interesting night of your life.

704
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.753
And what's even better.

705
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.030
those forms that you filled out.

706
00:32:59.734 --> 00:33:01.643
they allow us to do
anything we want with you.

707
00:33:04.875 --> 00:33:07.458
(Cecil laughs)

708
00:33:11.453 --> 00:33:13.143
There's no turning back now.

709
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.247
You're all in to the end.

710
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:25.140
It's showtime.

711
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.840
- Cecil Smith. hmm.
(Halloween sound effects)

712
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.553
Who is this man of darkness?

713
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.170
He sends freezing cold
shivers down my spine.

714
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.210
What I wouldn't do to spend a night

715
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.125
locked in a haunted house with him.

716
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:39.780
(laughs)

717
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.210
Well. who's ready to start this nightmare?

718
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.130
Let's get this party going?

719
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.990
Now remember to stay together.

720
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.123
and don't touch anything!

721
00:33:50.818 --> 00:33:52.230
- Ooh. yes!

722
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.700
Can you feel it in the air?
(Halloween sound effects)

723
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.650
That's Halloween. ladies and gentlemen.

724
00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.183
- One more thing. before
the real fun begins.

725
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.073
Everyone is to stay together.
unless otherwise informed.

726
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.290
You'll get your chance
to check things out.

727
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.410
but you do things my way. or else.

728
00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:18.390
- That's right. everyone.

729
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.800
You wander away from the group.

730
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.863
you're subject to have the
blood sucked from your neck.

731
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.800
- Can you wander away from the group?

732
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.417
- I'll second that.

733
00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:29.216
- I'm going to suck your blood.

734
00:34:29.216 --> 00:34:30.049
Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha.

735
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.180
- You know what. all
of you can kiss my ass.

736
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.040
I'm just trying to have a good time.

737
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.080
and get everyone into
the Halloween spirit.

738
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.730
and alls I've heard all night

739
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.050
is all of you mumbling under your breath.

740
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.170
and making fun of every
God damn word I say.

741
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.565
Every single one of you can piss off.

742
00:34:50.565 --> 00:34:53.215
I hope you all burn in hell.
and die in here tonight.

743
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.683
I'm outta here.

744
00:34:57.408 --> 00:35:00.075
(Evan laughing)

745
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.160
Sons of bitches!
(mask clatters)

746
00:35:06.853 --> 00:35:09.227
(Nick fumbling with door)

747
00:35:09.227 --> 00:35:12.459
Damn it. I need the damn key.

748
00:35:12.459 --> 00:35:14.827
(ominous music)

749
00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:16.727
Hey. do you have the key to this lock?

750
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.207
Look. I don't have time for this.

751
00:35:23.207 --> 00:35:26.193
do you have the key to this lock?

752
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.170
Listen. bitch. I just
wanna get out of here

753
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.820
before I do something I regret.

754
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.500
so for one last time.

755
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.893
do you have the key to this lock?

756
00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:59.464
(chain rattles)

757
00:35:59.464 --> 00:36:02.854
(Nick choking)

758
00:36:02.854 --> 00:36:04.720
(Nick gasping)

759
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.057
(chain clattering)

760
00:36:07.057 --> 00:36:10.224
(gagging and choking)

761
00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:14.445
(heavy breathing)

762
00:36:19.103 --> 00:36:22.603
(shoes thumping on floor)

763
00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:29.167
(bones crunching)
(chain rattling)

764
00:36:30.724 --> 00:36:32.940
(chain clatters to the floor)

765
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.996
- Get it. nuts?

766
00:36:34.996 --> 00:36:37.449
- (laughs) Like balls. right?

767
00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:38.880
- (laughs) Yeah.

768
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.351
- I didn't get it before. man.

769
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:42.127
- Oh my God.

770
00:36:46.952 --> 00:36:48.270
- Text from your girlfriend.

771
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.703
- No. a text from my mom.

772
00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:53.070
I'm telling her I'm staying
at a friend's tonight.

773
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.050
- Aw. you still let mommy
know where you're at.

774
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.630
- Yes. I don't want her to worry.

775
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.890
I mean. she is the type that if I tell her

776
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.960
I'm going to the store. and
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

777
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.910
she'll start worrying after 21 go by.

778
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.910
- Ah. so. um. why are you
lying about where you're at.

779
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.530
- 'Cause if I tell her I'm here.
she's not gonna believe me.

780
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.660
Then she'll stay up all
night worrying about me.

781
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.760
- You really are a
momma's boy. aren't you?

782
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.230
- Hey. shut up.

783
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.931
You don't know me well
enough to make fun of me.

784
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:20.490
- Well. in all honesty.

785
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.730
I think it's kinda cute.
(ominous music)

786
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.840
- Really?

787
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.673
- Yeah.

788
00:37:25.673 --> 00:37:27.970
- Okay. everyone. will you
please come over this way?

789
00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:30.886
The fun is about to start.

790
00:37:41.395 --> 00:37:44.062
(ominous music)

791
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.100
(Halloween sound effects)

792
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.253
I told all of you

793
00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:55.769
that you would get the chance
to roam around this house.

794
00:37:57.427 --> 00:37:59.850
and you have also been forewarned

795
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.250
about the dangers that
lurk around every corner.

796
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.333
But right now. we have a
special treat for one you.

797
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.533
Ah. how about this lovely
young lady. right here?

798
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.390
I promise not to bite hard. sweet heart.

799
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.980
- I'm more of an observer.

800
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.580
- No one is an observer tonight.

801
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.703
You are all my prey.

802
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.053
Trust me. take my hands.

803
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.040
(indistinct)

804
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.851
(laughing)

805
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:39.810
(thump)
- Oh!

806
00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:40.643
- Fine.

807
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.877
- And what might your name be. my sweet?

808
00:38:43.877 --> 00:38:45.275
- Sasha.

809
00:38:45.275 --> 00:38:48.210
- Sasha. what a beautiful name.

810
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.410
- Thank you.

811
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.750
- You're a very attractive lady.

812
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.390
I take it that you're
into fashion and makeup.

813
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.886
and all that glamor stuff.

814
00:38:55.886 --> 00:38:57.614
- Well. looks like this don't come easy.

815
00:38:57.614 --> 00:39:00.623
(men whistling and catcalling)

816
00:39:00.623 --> 00:39:03.120
- What if I told you that
we had some makeup artists

817
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.040
inside the house tonight?

818
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.870
Would that make you happy?

819
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.490
- I guess.

820
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.323
- Excellent.

821
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.660
Sasha. my darling. Waylon. here.

822
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.710
is going to take you for a special treat.

823
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.290
You're going to get a makeover.
as you've never had before.

824
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.820
and it's all curtesy of The Shadow's Edge.

825
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.463
Don't be afraid. take his hand.

826
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.210
He isn't going to do
anything to you. I promise.

827
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.507
That's it. now take her away.
(Halloween sound effects)

828
00:39:35.507 --> 00:39:36.540
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. wait. wait. wait.

829
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.370
- Relax.

830
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.200
- I don't want her leaving my sight.

831
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.543
- Well. unfortunately.
you can't go with her.

832
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.050
There's only room for one. you see.

833
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.350
- I'll be right back. hon.

834
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:55.770
- Now. as for the rest of you.

835
00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.693
won't you all follow me as
I take you on a little tour.

836
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.907
- About time.

837
00:40:04.907 --> 00:40:07.240
(footsteps)

838
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.083
- So. uh. need a hand to hold on to?

839
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.370
- There is no hand in
this world worth holding.

840
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.173
especially not yours.

841
00:40:22.304 --> 00:40:23.813
- Would a simple no have killed you?

842
00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:33.011
(ominous circus music)
(Halloween sound effects)

843
00:40:39.275 --> 00:40:42.473
(clowns snickering menacingly)

844
00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:43.980
- [Waylon] Go.
(slap)

845
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.770
- Don't you ever touch me
again. you fucking pig.

846
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.297
- You watch that pretty
little mouth of yours.

847
00:40:49.297 --> 00:40:50.551
- Get off me!

848
00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:53.634
(restraints clatter)

849
00:40:54.905 --> 00:40:56.152
Let me out--

850
00:40:56.152 --> 00:40:58.735
(Sasha crying)

851
00:41:36.391 --> 00:41:39.308
(Sasha whimpering)

852
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.993
- They'll make you so pretty.

853
00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:53.576
(Sasha crying)

854
00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.349
Perfect.

855
00:42:02.588 --> 00:42:07.588
God damn. you're beautiful.

856
00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:09.316
Stay still.

857
00:42:12.037 --> 00:42:13.564
I want this to be special.

858
00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.478
(thud)
Ah!

859
00:42:14.478 --> 00:42:15.478
God damn it!

860
00:42:17.154 --> 00:42:19.139
You stupid bitch!

861
00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:22.139
(breathing heavily)

862
00:42:36.004 --> 00:42:38.754
(clown snickers)

863
00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:43.025
(scissors snipping)

864
00:42:50.346 --> 00:42:52.929
(Sasha crying)

865
00:42:54.827 --> 00:42:56.410
Well. it's too bad.

866
00:42:57.825 --> 00:43:00.908
We could have been something special.

867
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.750
Now I'm gonna have to make
you look like one of us.

868
00:43:07.774 --> 00:43:10.750
(laughing)

869
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.138
(Sasha screaming)

870
00:43:14.138 --> 00:43:14.998
- What the hell was that?

871
00:43:14.998 --> 00:43:16.380
- All part of the experience.

872
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.520
Nothing to worry about.

873
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.530
- No. that sounded like Sasha.

874
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.430
- Where are you going?

875
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.620
- To see if my girlfriend's all right.

876
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.900
- I assure you. she's just fine.

877
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.250
She's getting special
VIP treatment. right now.

878
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.697
I promise you. everything
is going to be just fine.

879
00:43:33.697 --> 00:43:37.197
(Halloween sound effects)

880
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.480
Remember the rule of not touching anything

881
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.473
inside this house?

882
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.200
- Yeah. I just thought I saw some dust.

883
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.783
and I was gonna dust it off for you.

884
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.730
- Man. can't believe how much crap

885
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.920
they actually cram into this tent.

886
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.130
- You're calling all this crap? (laughs)

887
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:12.180
- Just seems like such a waste

888
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.710
to have all this stuff
set up for one night.

889
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.968
don't you think?

890
00:44:14.968 --> 00:44:16.613
- I don't know.

891
00:44:16.613 --> 00:44:19.050
I mean. I guess if you're really
passionate about something.

892
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:20.070
that makes it worth it.

893
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.830
and some people are so
passionate about things

894
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.020
that they're willing
to do anything for it.

895
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.880
- [Christian] What about you?

896
00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.900
- What about me?

897
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.580
- [Christian] Do you have
any passions in life?

898
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.200
- I have lots of passions?

899
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.540
- [Christian] Anything
you'd do anything for?

900
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.890
- Some.

901
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.030
- Well. name one.

902
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.380
just to give me an example.

903
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.870
- All right. well. I
guess. I'd have to say

904
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.880
that I'm passionate about
becoming an actress.

905
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.360
- An actress. really?
- Yeah. yeah.

906
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.440
- What kind of actress?

907
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.970
- What do you mean. what kind of actress?

908
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.970
- Oh. you know. like. TV
actress. stage actress? (laughs)

909
00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:58.320
- Hmm. I guess...

910
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.960
I guess I would like
to be a stage actress.

911
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.040
- You know. I never would have pegged you

912
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.060
as the actress type.

913
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.910
- Oh. and what would
you have pegged me as?

914
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.600
- Well. if I had to go with
my first impression of you.

915
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.673
I'd say. quiet type.

916
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.790
You know. innocent little girl.

917
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.010
and in high school. sat in the back.

918
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.650
and kept her head down.
didn't cause any trouble.

919
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.480
Always did what mommy and daddy told her.

920
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.950
never caused any problems.
- (laughing) Oh. God.

921
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.160
- Perfect little angel.

922
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.233
- (laughs) That's what you thought I was?

923
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.120
- Yeah. and I have to say.

924
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.290
even after talking to you for a little.

925
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.730
I think that's partially true.

926
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.890
You know. I think you're a rather shy

927
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.260
and to herself kind of girl.
- (laughs) Okay. okay. okay.

928
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.443
Well. let me let you
in on a little secret.

929
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:43.117
Come here.

930
00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:46.327
I'm not as innocent as I look.

931
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.143
- Can I help you with something?

932
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.523
- What happened to your face?

933
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.960
- I was in a car accident
when I was younger.

934
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.210
and I went face-first
through the windscreen.

935
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.733
- Did it hurt?

936
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.370
- What do you think?

937
00:46:22.423 --> 00:46:25.207
- (sighs) So. doesn't this
remind you of something

938
00:46:25.207 --> 00:46:27.063
out of an '80s horror film?

939
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:30.660
- Is that all you do with your existence.

940
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.000
is watch horror films?

941
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.973
- No. I also watch porn.

942
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.910
- Ugh.

943
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.743
- What?

944
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.680
- (clears throat) So are we gonna get

945
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.000
to roam around on our own?

946
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.653
I'm about ready to fall asleep.

947
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.530
- [Evan] Yeah. this is pretty lame.

948
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.510
I've got a neighbor that
does one out of his garage.

949
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.783
and that's scarier than this.

950
00:46:56.783 --> 00:46:59.400
- (sighs) I have to agree.
(Halloween sound effect)

951
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.500
Can't we go back to the makeover?

952
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.782
I've been dying to have
an afternoon like that.

953
00:47:04.782 --> 00:47:07.470
(laughs softly)

954
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.783
- You guys have no idea
what you're in for.

955
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.000
Everything I told you
(Halloween sound effects)

956
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.923
about this haunted house is true.

957
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.360
- That's funny 'cause I
don't remember you saying

958
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.103
this haunted house blows ass.

959
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:21.803
What. dude?

960
00:47:21.803 --> 00:47:24.090
Look. all I know is that when
I signed up for this contest.

961
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.090
it sounded like we were gonna
be able to roam around freely.

962
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.833
and we haven't been able
to do a thing like that.

963
00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:35.460
- If you want to roam freely
throughout this haunted house.

964
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.047
all you have to do is ask.

965
00:47:37.973 --> 00:47:39.873
- Can I roam around the haunted house?

966
00:47:41.629 --> 00:47:42.462
- Of corse.

967
00:47:42.462 --> 00:47:43.295
- Thank God.

968
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.750
- Finally.

969
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.100
- Wait. Raven!

970
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.953
I. uh. don't want you to be alone.

971
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.193
- Fuck this. I'm out of here.

972
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.870
- [Evan] Hey. Christian.
you want to head off. too.

973
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.340
and check out this place?

974
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.173
- No. man.

975
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.120
- [Evan] What?

976
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.953
- Abbie.

977
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.550
- What about her?

978
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.320
- We're gonna go off by ourselves.

979
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.222
- Nice. give me some!

980
00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:15.139
(Christian laughs)

981
00:48:17.013 --> 00:48:18.900
- [Christian] Hey.
- Hey.

982
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.370
- Which way you headed?

983
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.680
- I don't know. but I don't
want to head off by myself.

984
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.763
- Would you like some company?

985
00:48:23.763 --> 00:48:28.110
- I'd love it. (laughs)

986
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.410
- For someone who thinks
this place is boring.

987
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.330
and wanted to go and explore the place.

988
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.040
you're sure spending a lot
of time in the same room.

989
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.290
- Yeah. I just thought I'd hang out here.

990
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.570
and let everyone else get a head start

991
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:44.220
on checking out the place.

992
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.260
Besides. I thought I'd. uh.

993
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.810
touch all the pictures in
this room when you leave.

994
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.707
- Don't think I don't know
sarcasm when I hear it.

995
00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.770
But you've got to be the biggest smart ass

996
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.050
that I've ever known.

997
00:48:58.497 --> 00:49:00.123
and I promise you this.

998
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.903
if you touch anything
else inside this house.

999
00:49:05.573 --> 00:49:06.406
I'll kill you.

1000
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.603
- Oh. I get it. now you're
the one being a smart ass.

1001
00:49:12.603 --> 00:49:13.503
(laughs) I get it.

1002
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.500
- Now. if you excuse me.

1003
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.370
I have some business to attend to.

1004
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.860
- [Evan] See you. See-cil.

1005
00:49:25.617 --> 00:49:27.510
- It's Cecil.

1006
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.110
- [Evan] Catch you later. Cecil.

1007
00:49:44.162 --> 00:49:49.162
(door scraping)
(ominous music)

1008
00:49:56.146 --> 00:49:57.488
(door scraping)

1009
00:49:57.488 --> 00:49:59.405
(thud)

1010
00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:07.293
(door scraping)

1011
00:50:09.337 --> 00:50:11.004
- Hm. hungry. Abbie?

1012
00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:16.800
- Mm. you know. as
delicious as that looks.

1013
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.900
I think I'm gonna pass.

1014
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.463
- Whatever. you're missing out.

1015
00:50:22.126 --> 00:50:24.900
Man. you gotta have a
lot of time on your hands

1016
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.600
to think of all this creepy
stuff for a haunted house.

1017
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.450
- [Abbie] I don't know. I
think it's kind of creative.

1018
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.883
- Creative. I think
it's borderline psycho.

1019
00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:35.460
(knife scraping)

1020
00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.363
Well. that's hot.

1021
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.153
- Oh. yeah?

1022
00:50:38.153 --> 00:50:39.000
You think so?

1023
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.860
- Yeah. the only thing that's missing

1024
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.390
is some blood all over the knife.

1025
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.710
- Well. come here and give me some blood.

1026
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.742
- Hey.
(Abbie laughing)

1027
00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:45.810
take it easy. you're gonna hurt somebody.

1028
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.044
- I want some of your blood.

1029
00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:49.711
(both laughing)

1030
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.287
Let's go check out some
of the other rooms.

1031
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.533
- Come on. work.

1032
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.053
Sasha. you in here. babe?

1033
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:20.460
Sasha. quit being the
little bitch you are.

1034
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.810
and come on out. all ready!

1035
00:51:27.875 --> 00:51:28.782
(picture rattles)

1036
00:51:28.782 --> 00:51:30.115
God damn clowns.

1037
00:51:31.608 --> 00:51:32.441
(creaking)

1038
00:51:32.441 --> 00:51:33.274
Who's there?

1039
00:51:37.864 --> 00:51:39.780
(ominous music)

1040
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.100
Shit. man.

1041
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.820
Fucking gave me a fucking heart attack.

1042
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.340
Where's Sasha?

1043
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.173
- Who?

1044
00:51:48.173 --> 00:51:50.490
- My girlfriend. the
one you took with you.

1045
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:51.950
- Oh. right. uh...

1046
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.743
She's. uh. she's back that way.

1047
00:52:04.157 --> 00:52:06.740
(box creaking)

1048
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.123
- Raven. where'd you go?

1049
00:52:15.483 --> 00:52:17.853
Man. that girl is playing hard to get.

1050
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:20.111
and I'm loving it.

1051
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.703
Oh. speaking of loving
it. this is awesome.

1052
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.333
Huh.

1053
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.393
Whoa. kick ass.

1054
00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:56.537
(scissors slicing)

1055
00:52:56.537 --> 00:52:58.890
Ah. you cut me!

1056
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.660
What the hell is the matter with you?

1057
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.860
- Don't touch my doll.

1058
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.480
- Yeah. well. don't
play with sharp objects.

1059
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.430
Give me those scissors!

1060
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.025
I said. give the to me.

1061
00:53:07.025 --> 00:53:08.401
- No.

1062
00:53:08.401 --> 00:53:13.401
(Vincent grunts)
(ominous music)

1063
00:53:13.457 --> 00:53:15.790
(footsteps)

1064
00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:20.223
- What's going on in here?

1065
00:53:20.223 --> 00:53:21.660
- Your little friend. here. just cut me

1066
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.820
with those scissors in her hand.

1067
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.123
- What have I told you about
playing with these scissors?

1068
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:29.820
Give me those scissors.

1069
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.770
and go wait outside in the hall for me.

1070
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.153
Let me see.

1071
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.620
- Look. I understand you wanting to give

1072
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.850
the ultimate scare. and all.

1073
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.710
but having little girls run
around with sharp scissors.

1074
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.563
cutting into people's arms.
isn't my idea of a fun time.

1075
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.130
- It's just a scrape.
(Halloween sound effects)

1076
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.779
Look. I'll tell you what.

1077
00:53:57.779 --> 00:54:00.090
I've got some bandages in
one of the control rooms

1078
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.490
that Waylon can get for you.

1079
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.803
- Good.

1080
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.080
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

1081
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.730
- [Cecil] Oh. I'll handle her.

1082
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.580
She knows better.

1083
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.747
She'll get a stern talking to.

1084
00:54:13.747 --> 00:54:16.020
- Yeah. and maybe a spanking
wouldn't hurt her. either.

1085
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.370
- I said I'll deal with it.

1086
00:54:18.323 --> 00:54:20.310
Now. if you can find your
way back to the study room.

1087
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:22.923
where we first met up.
I'll send Waylon your way.

1088
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:27.730
I'm going to have a word with
the young lady. right now.

1089
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.060
Young girl. what have I told you

1090
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.010
about playing with these scissors. hmm?

1091
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.980
This is not a toy.

1092
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.830
this is a very serious and sharp tool.

1093
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:48.633
and can do some serious damage.

1094
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.230
Now what happens when I take
a pair of scissors like this.

1095
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.823
and I cut someone's arm. hmm?

1096
00:54:54.835 --> 00:54:56.907
- [Little Girl] They get cut.

1097
00:54:56.907 --> 00:54:59.707
- And what happens when someone
gets a cut on their arm?

1098
00:55:00.787 --> 00:55:02.040
- [Little Girl] They bleed.

1099
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.840
- How much do they bleed?

1100
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.663
I said. how much do they bleed?

1101
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.193
- [Little Girl] Not very much.

1102
00:55:09.193 --> 00:55:12.750
- (sighs) How many more
times do I have to tell you?

1103
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.550
If you're going to cut someone.

1104
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.430
you do it either here. or here.

1105
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.890
Never. ever cut their arm.

1106
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.253
Not unless you have a bigger.
sharper pair of scissors. hmm?

1107
00:55:25.854 --> 00:55:28.021
(sighing)

1108
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.793
I know you're young. I
know you're still learning.

1109
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.650
I know. some day. you'll
get all this stuff down.

1110
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.110
You have potential.

1111
00:55:40.047 --> 00:55:42.363
and one day you'll make better decisions.

1112
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:47.400
Now where's that pretty
little smile of yours

1113
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.230
that I like to see. hmm?

1114
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.340
That's it.

1115
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.010
Now. go on. get out of here.

1116
00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.470
- Well. I learned that lesson
(Halloween sound effects)

1117
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:59.864
a long time ago.

1118
00:55:59.864 --> 00:56:01.443
(scissors snipping)

1119
00:56:01.443 --> 00:56:04.473
Ooh. mine still has some blood on it.

1120
00:56:08.055 --> 00:56:08.888
Hmm.

1121
00:56:10.231 --> 00:56:11.064
(Halloween sound effects)
- [Abbie] I thought there were

1122
00:56:11.064 --> 00:56:13.650
so-called monsters in here that
were supposed to be hiding.

1123
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.990
and jump out and scare us. (laughs)

1124
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.233
- Maybe they fell asleep
'cause they were bored.

1125
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:25.643
- What?

1126
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:28.763
- Screw it.

1127
00:56:31.553 --> 00:56:32.720
Uh. I'm sorry.

1128
00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.663
It just felt right.

1129
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:51.820
That was incredible.

1130
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.630
- I'm not usually like this.

1131
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.060
- Well. I'm glad you're like that with me.

1132
00:57:00.648 --> 00:57:03.231
Come on. let's get out of here.

1133
00:57:07.026 --> 00:57:12.026
(ominous music)
(Halloween sound effects)

1134
00:57:29.544 --> 00:57:30.377
- Hello?

1135
00:57:30.377 --> 00:57:32.044
Babe. where are you?

1136
00:57:34.333 --> 00:57:36.000
Baby. where are you?

1137
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:40.291
Who is this?

1138
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:45.029
Ah. damn it!

1139
00:57:55.131 --> 00:57:57.714
(tape ripping)

1140
00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:04.560
- You know. for such a
dark and isolated person.

1141
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.063
you do have a tender touch.

1142
00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.130
(slap)

1143
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:11.963
Ow.

1144
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.130
So I bet everything that
I'm saying right now

1145
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:18.840
is turning you on.

1146
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.660
It's getting you all wound up and excited.

1147
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.610
You're just ready to explode with emotion.

1148
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.093
You're just looking for
something to take it out on.

1149
00:58:27.688 --> 00:58:28.521
You probably want to take me

1150
00:58:28.521 --> 00:58:29.940
right here. right now. don't you?

1151
00:58:34.728 --> 00:58:36.728
(thump)

1152
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:40.950
Ah! (laughs nervously)

1153
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.224
- Is that what you wanted?

1154
00:58:42.224 --> 00:58:43.230
(Vincent laughs)

1155
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.907
- Uh. yeah..

1156
00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:47.793
- I want you. right here.

1157
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.365
- Right here?

1158
00:58:50.365 --> 00:58:51.198
- Here.

1159
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.160
- In front of him?

1160
00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.483
- Yeah.

1161
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.300
- I've got an idea.

1162
00:59:02.046 --> 00:59:05.046
(hurried footsteps)

1163
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.980
- So I see those two are still alive.

1164
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.393
So what's the update on the rest of them?

1165
00:59:21.278 --> 00:59:22.994
- I don't know.

1166
00:59:22.994 --> 00:59:25.233
(ominous music)

1167
00:59:25.233 --> 00:59:27.780
- When our Sissy passed away.

1168
00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.750
I promised her I'd look after you.

1169
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.593
but you are about to join her.

1170
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.950
Now get out there and do your job.

1171
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:37.400
before those kids start
sniffing around too much.

1172
00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.490
- It's the room where
that little girl cut me.

1173
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.390
Thought we could make use of this bed.

1174
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:54.110
Oh!

1175
00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.890
- Wait. you want to do this
on the little girl's bed?

1176
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.420
- It's not like she really lives here.

1177
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.550
she's just an actor pretending.

1178
01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:07.260
- But what if she comes back in?

1179
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.250
- She's not coming back in.

1180
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:10.230
she's all ready got in
trouble for cutting my arm.

1181
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.513
Now come on. let's do this all ready.

1182
01:00:15.227 --> 01:00:17.727
(Raven sighs)

1183
01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:23.973
Ah. ah. ah. ow. ow. ow!

1184
01:00:26.233 --> 01:00:27.987
- (laughs) What. did I hurt you?

1185
01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:29.133
You little baby.

1186
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.420
- No. no. it's just. uh. fine. baby.

1187
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.213
I just wasn't expecting
you to chow down on my lip.

1188
01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:49.793
Ow. jeez. what you do that for?

1189
01:00:49.793 --> 01:00:51.763
- (laughs) Just go with it.

1190
01:01:00.467 --> 01:01:02.777
- Baby. you are a freak.

1191
01:01:02.777 --> 01:01:04.194
- [Raven] Mm-hmm.

1192
01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:09.850
(ominous music)

1193
01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:28.112
(scissors stabbing)

1194
01:01:28.112 --> 01:01:30.743
(Vincent screaming)

1195
01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:33.576
(Raven screaming)

1196
01:01:35.403 --> 01:01:36.236
- What was that?

1197
01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:37.486
- I don't know.

1198
01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:43.488
(scampering footsteps)

1199
01:01:47.934 --> 01:01:49.310
(door slams open)

1200
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.558
Ah. oh Jesus Christ!

1201
01:01:50.558 --> 01:01:53.391
(Raven screaming)

1202
01:01:56.531 --> 01:01:58.772
Somebody help me!

1203
01:01:58.772 --> 01:02:00.689
(thud)

1204
01:02:08.948 --> 01:02:10.590
Please. don't hurt me.

1205
01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:13.597
(Raven sobbing)

1206
01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:15.263
(head exploding)

1207
01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:18.013
(blood dripping)

1208
01:02:21.032 --> 01:02:23.865
(hammer thudding)

1209
01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:26.644
- What the fuck?

1210
01:02:26.644 --> 01:02:29.108
(grunting)

1211
01:02:29.108 --> 01:02:31.358
(smashing)

1212
01:02:35.378 --> 01:02:37.545
(yelling)

1213
01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:42.986
(door slamming)

1214
01:02:42.986 --> 01:02:45.236
(grunting)

1215
01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.247
(running footsteps)

1216
01:02:56.247 --> 01:02:57.463
- [Eli] Go!
- Whoa. whoa. what's up?

1217
01:02:57.463 --> 01:02:58.296
- Just go!

1218
01:02:58.296 --> 01:02:59.129
- [Christian] What happened?

1219
01:02:59.129 --> 01:03:00.462
- [Eli] Come on!

1220
01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:08.013
(Eli breathing heavily)

1221
01:03:08.013 --> 01:03:09.642
- Eli. tell us what's going on.

1222
01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:11.692
(Eli breathing heavily)
Eli. talk to us!

1223
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:14.820
- This place. it's. uh...

1224
01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.560
Some-something's...

1225
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.670
Something's. something's not right.

1226
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.503
Something's going on.

1227
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:19.336
- What?

1228
01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:20.562
- Look. just tell us what's going on.

1229
01:03:20.562 --> 01:03:22.380
- He just killed her.

1230
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.550
- Killed who?

1231
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.160
I don't. uh. the gothic looking chick.

1232
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.270
- What. Raven?

1233
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.950
- Yeah.
- Wait. somebody killed Raven?

1234
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:29.783
- Ugh.

1235
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:33.690
- Are you sure she was killed?

1236
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.400
I mean. it's not an act. or something?

1237
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.783
It's a haunted house. dude!

1238
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.860
- You think I don't know what I just saw?

1239
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.590
He took a frickin'
sledgehammer to her head.

1240
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.210
- Wait. wait. you're starting...

1241
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.400
You're starting to freak me out.

1242
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.018
- [Christian] Look. who killed her?

1243
01:03:49.018 --> 01:03:52.713
- I don't know. it was some big guy.

1244
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.670
He had long hair. looks like
he didn't shower in years.

1245
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:57.503
- Where is he?

1246
01:03:58.350 --> 01:03:59.183
- I...

1247
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.103
I stabbed him.

1248
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.780
- I want out of here. we need
to get the hell out of here.

1249
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.460
- We'll get out of here. just calm down.

1250
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.860
- Ah. I don't believe this.

1251
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.020
- Maybe we should call the police. first.

1252
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.452
- [Abbie] Where is it?

1253
01:04:14.452 --> 01:04:16.740
- I don't know. I had it before.

1254
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.670
Where's your cell phone?

1255
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.840
- I don't carry a cell phone.

1256
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.490
- Who doesn't carry a cell phone?

1257
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:22.380
Well. Eli. let's use yours.

1258
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.220
- No. screw that.

1259
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.300
My girlfriend is somewhere in here.

1260
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.860
and I'm not leaving til I find her.

1261
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.510
- Wait. are you crazy?

1262
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.363
There's a killer out there.

1263
01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:30.840
and you want to look for
your girlfriend by yourself?

1264
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.100
- You need to get your hands off me.

1265
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.117
- We need to find a way out of here.

1266
01:04:33.117 --> 01:04:35.040
- And you need to get out of my way.

1267
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.780
- Fine. give me your cell phone.

1268
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.962
- I said get out of my way.

1269
01:04:37.962 --> 01:04:40.712
- Don't shove me!
- Boys. stop it!

1270
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:45.420
- Look. you guys can do
whatever the hell you guys want.

1271
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.250
I'm gonna go find Sasha.

1272
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.380
- [Christian] We shouldn't
leave each other.

1273
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.990
- Listen. I don't care
for either one of you.

1274
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.520
All I know is someone just got killed.

1275
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.010
and my girlfriend is still
in here somewhere. alone.

1276
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.010
I'm gonna do whatever I can to find her.

1277
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:00.990
- Going somewhere?

1278
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.150
- What kind of messed up
house do you have here?

1279
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:05.450
I just saw some chick
get her face smashed in.

1280
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.010
- I think you better calm down.

1281
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:09.180
- I think you need to tell me exactly

1282
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.650
what the hell's going on here.

1283
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.480
- I told you before.

1284
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.371
what's inside these walls lives--

1285
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.680
(fist thudding)

1286
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.880
- You better hope nothing
happened to Sasha.

1287
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.900
- Are you all right?

1288
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.733
- I'm fine.

1289
01:05:22.733 --> 01:05:25.830
- Cecil. we need to get
out of here and get help.

1290
01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:27.725
- Do you have the key to get out of here?

1291
01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:29.517
- Yes. it's right here.

1292
01:05:29.517 --> 01:05:31.740
- All right. let's go.

1293
01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.120
- [Cecil] Wait.

1294
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.910
there's something we
have to do before we go.

1295
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.470
- What?
(ominous music)

1296
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.814
(Christian grunting)
(Abbie screaming)

1297
01:05:39.814 --> 01:05:41.606
- Let go of me!

1298
01:05:41.606 --> 01:05:43.205
(thud)

1299
01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.853
Stop. stop hitting him!

1300
01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:47.520
(Abbie sobbing)

1301
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.490
- I bet the two of you
have a million questions

1302
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:52.607
running through your heads right now.

1303
01:05:52.607 --> 01:05:54.186
- You won't get away with this.

1304
01:05:54.186 --> 01:05:57.802
- [Cecil] (laughs) I
all ready have. my boy.

1305
01:05:57.802 --> 01:05:59.940
I all ready have.

1306
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.630
You see. if word gets
out that something fishy

1307
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:05.280
was going on inside this house.

1308
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.180
I just act like one of the
contestant winners snapped.

1309
01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.280
and went on a killing rampage.

1310
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.863
killing everyone inside the haunted house.

1311
01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.960
And then I'll give
myself a few little cuts

1312
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.900
to make it look as it
the killer turned on me.

1313
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.723
and when I get interviewed
by the police and media.

1314
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.350
I'll just say how unfortunate it was

1315
01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:32.402
that this had to happen. and
how I feel for the families

1316
01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:36.240
and the victims. yadda. yadda. yadda.

1317
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.603
And the next thing you
know. I'm on my way.

1318
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.363
It's perfect.

1319
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.850
- What did we do to you?

1320
01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:47.760
- [Cecil] (laughs) Why
does everything have to be

1321
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.203
done for a reason. huh?

1322
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:51.986
Did you ever stop to think

1323
01:06:51.986 --> 01:06:53.460
that there are sick people out there

1324
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.123
who just enjoy torturing and
killing other people. huh?

1325
01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.110
- [Christian] You're sick.

1326
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:02.193
- You bet I am.

1327
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:06.530
Take them to their separate rooms.

1328
01:07:16.637 --> 01:07:18.397
(quiet whimpering)

1329
01:07:18.397 --> 01:07:20.210
- Oh my God. no.

1330
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.667
No. no. babe?
(coughing and crying)

1331
01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:25.917
Babe. what happened to you?

1332
01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.640
(Sasha coughing and crying)

1333
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.473
Oh my God.

1334
01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:35.379
I'm gonna get whoever did this.

1335
01:07:35.379 --> 01:07:37.133
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

1336
01:07:37.133 --> 01:07:39.633
(both crying)

1337
01:07:40.845 --> 01:07:44.034
I love you so much.
(ominous music)

1338
01:07:44.034 --> 01:07:45.728
(flesh squelching)

1339
01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.811
(suspenseful music)

1340
01:08:26.498 --> 01:08:28.748
(thudding)

1341
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.660
- My mother told me
that when I was little.

1342
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.073
I was fascinated with blood.

1343
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:45.180
- Wait. don't kill me.

1344
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.231
Let me go. I won't tell anyone about this.

1345
01:08:47.231 --> 01:08:49.193
(Cecil laughing)

1346
01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:52.110
- Oh. you kids are so dumb these days.

1347
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:54.420
Do you think I'm going to kill you?

1348
01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.820
No. where's the fun in that?

1349
01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.567
I'm just going to torture you.

1350
01:08:59.519 --> 01:09:02.132
and then I'll let Waylon. here. kill you.

1351
01:09:02.132 --> 01:09:04.930
(Cecil chuckles)

1352
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:06.780
- Don't touch me. asshole!

1353
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.160
- Can one of you get his feet for me?

1354
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.063
Thanks.

1355
01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:17.613
Now hold him tight.

1356
01:09:18.835 --> 01:09:20.216
(Christian yelling)

1357
01:09:20.216 --> 01:09:25.216
(Christian gasping)
(Cecil laughing)

1358
01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:34.962
(blood dripping)
Now this is living.

1359
01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:41.730
(sighs) Well. I'd love
to stay and cause you

1360
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:43.939
some more pain and discomfort.

1361
01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.737
but there's a young lady
that needs some attention.

1362
01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:50.853
You know. there's something
about torturing girls

1363
01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.707
that I enjoy better than guys.

1364
01:09:52.707 --> 01:09:55.171
- [Christian] You touch
her and I'll kill you.

1365
01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:57.570
- Now. now. I believe that's what Waylon

1366
01:09:57.570 --> 01:09:58.833
is going to do to you.

1367
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:04.383
- You hear that. boy?

1368
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.470
I'm gonna kill you.

1369
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:11.633
Right there.

1370
01:10:16.226 --> 01:10:20.640
(thud) (flesh squelching)
(fence clattering)

1371
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.710
- Evan?

1372
01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:22.650
Holly shit.

1373
01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:24.390
- What the hell's going on here?

1374
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:25.530
Why are they trying to kill us?

1375
01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:27.630
- I don't know. man. but
we gotta get out of here.

1376
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:29.040
- How are we getting out of here?

1377
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.763
- Cecil has the keys.
(flesh squelching)

1378
01:10:30.763 --> 01:10:32.313
(thud) (horn honking)
- [Evan] Where is Cecil?

1379
01:10:32.313 --> 01:10:34.050
- He's going after Abbie.

1380
01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:35.100
We gotta go save her.

1381
01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:41.450
(Evan breathing heavily)

1382
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.330
Come on. man. we gotta keep moving.

1383
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:47.130
- Yeah. I'm just getting dizzy. man.

1384
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.028
I got hit in the head with a hammer.

1385
01:10:49.028 --> 01:10:49.861
- You gonna be all right?

1386
01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:51.929
- [Evan] Yeah. yeah. I just
need to rest for a minute.

1387
01:10:51.929 --> 01:10:53.304
Go on. I'll catch up with you.

1388
01:10:53.304 --> 01:10:54.660
- No way. man. I'm not leaving.

1389
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.493
Here. I'll help you.

1390
01:10:55.493 --> 01:10:57.636
we can keep moving.
- [Evan] No. just go!

1391
01:10:57.636 --> 01:10:59.801
Go on. I'll be right behind you.

1392
01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:00.964
- You sure?

1393
01:11:00.964 --> 01:11:03.620
- [Evan] Yeah. just
go. (breathing heavily)

1394
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.830
- All right.

1395
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:06.964
Don't take too long. I'm not
leaving here without you.

1396
01:11:06.964 --> 01:11:09.042
- [Evan] Okay. just go get Abbie.

1397
01:11:09.042 --> 01:11:11.709
(ominous music)

1398
01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:17.271
(running footsteps)

1399
01:11:18.473 --> 01:11:21.890
(scuffling across floor)

1400
01:11:30.836 --> 01:11:33.586
(Evan screaming)

1401
01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.420
- I'm gonna kill 'em all.

1402
01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.076
(running footsteps)

1403
01:11:50.076 --> 01:11:53.223
- (whispering) Christian?

1404
01:11:53.223 --> 01:11:54.056
- [Christian] (whispering) Are you okay?

1405
01:11:54.056 --> 01:11:58.252
I'll get you out of here.
(metal clanking)

1406
01:11:58.252 --> 01:12:00.502
- [Abbie] Christian. hurry.

1407
01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:15.369
- All right. let's get
you the hell out of here.

1408
01:12:20.264 --> 01:12:21.214
Come this way.

1409
01:12:21.214 --> 01:12:22.047
- [Abbie] No. don't go that way.

1410
01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:22.880
Let's go this way.

1411
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.713
- [Christian] But there's no exit

1412
01:12:23.713 --> 01:12:25.296
that way.
- Come on!

1413
01:12:28.164 --> 01:12:31.081
(flesh squelching)

1414
01:12:37.814 --> 01:12:39.314
- Here. hold this.

1415
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:45.284
(ominous music)
(Abbie gasps)

1416
01:12:45.284 --> 01:12:46.905
Abbie!

1417
01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:48.655
- Don't come any closer.

1418
01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:50.920
or I'll cut her throat.

1419
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.610
- Look. just put the knife
down. and let her go.

1420
01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.260
She hasn't done anything to you.

1421
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.020
- Do you understand the concept
of me cutting her throat?

1422
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.170
Now stay where you are.

1423
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.133
- Just give us the key. and let her go.

1424
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.780
- Let ger go. give us the key. (laughs)

1425
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.213
Listen to you. you sound like an idiot.

1426
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.410
Do you think I'm just going
to let you waltz out of here?

1427
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.360
I've got a good thing going on in here.

1428
01:13:20.623 --> 01:13:21.960
- Maybe we can help you.

1429
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.793
Join you.

1430
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.443
- Join me. yeah. right.

1431
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:29.369
You don't have what it
takes to kill people.

1432
01:13:29.369 --> 01:13:32.700
But wait a minute. you
killed Waylon. didn't you?

1433
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.055
That's how you got away.

1434
01:13:35.055 --> 01:13:37.305
Bravo. he's one of my best.

1435
01:13:38.436 --> 01:13:40.463
- [Abbie] You're a sick freak.

1436
01:13:40.463 --> 01:13:41.373
- Careful. honey.

1437
01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:43.723
I've got a sharp object
up against your throat.

1438
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.270
- We can work this out.

1439
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:51.150
You killed my best friend.
we killed your best friend.

1440
01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:52.110
We're even.

1441
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:55.353
Firstly. Waylon wasn't my best friend.

1442
01:13:56.263 --> 01:13:59.580
and secondly. there you go again.

1443
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:03.330
thinking there has to be a
reason for someone being killed.

1444
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:05.717
Do you know how many people we've killed?

1445
01:14:05.717 --> 01:14:09.393
Hundreds. and we're going
to kill hundreds more.

1446
01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:13.129
I don't care who they are.

1447
01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:15.687
I don't even care that you killed Waylon.

1448
01:14:15.687 --> 01:14:18.033
All I care about is torturing people.

1449
01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.889
You see these scars on my face?

1450
01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:25.044
It wasn't a car accident.

1451
01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:25.877
I did it.

1452
01:14:27.156 --> 01:14:28.656
Handy work. right?

1453
01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.857
I got bored one night.

1454
01:14:31.857 --> 01:14:34.953
and I sat in front of the
mirror and cut my face.

1455
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:38.703
and watched the blood drip down my face.

1456
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.173
So I guess you're right.
I am a sick freak.

1457
01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.213
You know what?

1458
01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.340
I'm sick of explaining myself to you.

1459
01:14:53.385 --> 01:14:55.913
I'm going to kill her.

1460
01:14:55.913 --> 01:14:58.080
and I'm going to kill you.

1461
01:14:59.175 --> 01:15:00.810
Is there anything you
want to tell Christian

1462
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:02.160
before you die. sweetheart?

1463
01:15:03.444 --> 01:15:04.799
No?

1464
01:15:04.799 --> 01:15:06.463
(Abbie gasping)

1465
01:15:06.463 --> 01:15:07.296
Okay.

1466
01:15:08.457 --> 01:15:09.801
This is going to be sweet.

1467
01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:11.167
(ominous music)
(squelching)

1468
01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:15.250
(Christian grunting and yelling)

1469
01:15:17.139 --> 01:15:19.497
(thud)

1470
01:15:19.497 --> 01:15:20.433
- Get the knife.

1471
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.033
- Christian. no. wait!

1472
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.090
We can work something out.

1473
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.340
It doesn't have to end this way.

1474
01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.320
- Yeah. it does. you bastard.

1475
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.549
(knife stabbing)

1476
01:15:37.549 --> 01:15:40.549
(Christian gasping)

1477
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:45.603
- Looks to be a bit pale. dad.

1478
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.823
- I'd say so. darling.

1479
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.290
Wipe that makeup off your face. now. dear.

1480
01:15:54.807 --> 01:15:57.740
- What. you looked shocked. Christian?

1481
01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:01.879
What. you don't like me anymore?

1482
01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:04.985
I thought we had something going.

1483
01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:07.598
What do you think of
my new boyfriend. dad?

1484
01:16:07.598 --> 01:16:10.181
- Mm. I don't know. sweetheart.

1485
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.790
I don't think he's your type.

1486
01:16:14.201 --> 01:16:16.731
No. I don't approve of this one.

1487
01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:17.731
- Okay. dad.

1488
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.680
(sighs) Oh. well.

1489
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.955
I guess we can't date. after all.

1490
01:16:25.955 --> 01:16:29.219
So what are we going to do with this one?

1491
01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:31.052
- Let Chainz kill him.

1492
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:34.990
- No. dad. let me kill him. please.

1493
01:16:36.248 --> 01:16:37.603
- I don't know. Abigail.

1494
01:16:37.603 --> 01:16:38.968
- Oh. come on.

1495
01:16:38.968 --> 01:16:41.016
- I don't think you're ready
for killing someone. yet.

1496
01:16:41.016 --> 01:16:43.437
- Dad. I did all the
work of keeping him here.

1497
01:16:43.437 --> 01:16:44.920
You should have seen me. dad.

1498
01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.648
I was doing so good.

1499
01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:49.398
I could be an actress. after all.

1500
01:16:50.275 --> 01:16:51.873
Let me kill him. dad. please.

1501
01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.456
I'm ready. I swear.

1502
01:16:57.171 --> 01:17:01.077
- These are the moments that
a parent really treasures.

1503
01:17:01.077 --> 01:17:02.407
- [Christian] You bitch.

1504
01:17:02.407 --> 01:17:05.469
(Abbie laughs)

1505
01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:07.837
- What did you call me?

1506
01:17:07.837 --> 01:17:09.997
- [Christian] How could you do this?

1507
01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:12.387
- (laughs) Are you listening to this. dad?

1508
01:17:12.387 --> 01:17:14.137
He wants to know why.

1509
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:17.868
You know. I don't know.

1510
01:17:18.714 --> 01:17:21.063
I guess you could say it's a family thing.

1511
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:34.061
(knife stabbing)
(ominous music)

1512
01:17:34.714 --> 01:17:37.464
(heart pounding)

1513
01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:42.553
(heart slowing)

1514
01:17:52.855 --> 01:17:57.855
(Christmas music)
(people talking)

1515
01:18:13.493 --> 01:18:17.130
- (sighs) Holidays make
me sick to my stomach.

1516
01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:18.080
wouldn't you agree?

1517
01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.213
- Yeah.

1518
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.013
- I'm Abigail.

1519
01:18:23.007 --> 01:18:24.723
- Michael.
- Michael.

1520
01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:28.191
You have the most beautiful eyes. Michael.

1521
01:18:28.191 --> 01:18:30.210
if you don't mind me saying so.

1522
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.882
- Thanks. I grew them myself.

1523
01:18:31.882 --> 01:18:33.210
(Abigail laughs)

1524
01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:35.160
- So are you here with anybody?

1525
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.410
- Yeah. my mom. dad. and sister

1526
01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:40.257
are inside that stupid
Christmas Wonderland thing.

1527
01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.153
- And you decided to stay out here.

1528
01:18:43.517 --> 01:18:46.143
- Man. I grew out of this
stuff when I was nine.

1529
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:50.163
- Come on. don't you think
it'd be fun to go through it?

1530
01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:54.900
Come on. you're not gonna make me

1531
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.237
go in there all alone. are you?

1532
01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.820
- Uh. I don't know.

1533
01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:02.906
- Come on. it'll be fun. I promise.

1534
01:19:16.181 --> 01:19:17.098
- Ho ho ho.

1535
01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:24.946
- [Michael] (screaming) No!

1536
01:19:24.946 --> 01:19:27.946
(heavy metal music)

1537
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.530
- You know what they say.
(Halloween sound effects)

1538
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:41.340
a family that slays
together. stays together.

1539
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.440
You know. I was thinking about purchasing

1540
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.350
The Shadow's Edge. but
seems they like to keep

1541
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:47.883
the business in the family.

1542
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:51.600
Well. many holidays are upon us.

1543
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.450
so be careful which house you enter.

1544
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:56.799
You may be there for eternity.

1545
01:22:56.799 --> 01:22:59.283
(laughs) Until next time. my victims.

1546
01:23:00.617 --> 01:23:03.284
