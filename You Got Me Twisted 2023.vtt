(dramatic music continues)

11
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:32.360
- It's bad enough I had
a messed-up childhood.

12
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:39.492
but now I gotta have a
dysfunctional adulthood. too?

13
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:40.368
God.

14
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.499
what do you want from me?

15
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.797
You shoulda took
my life years ago.

16
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.849
You know. I'm. I ended up
in two failed marriages.

17
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.979
and these were supposed
to be men of your cloth.

18
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.366
I'm supposed to be this
so-called woman of God.

19
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:24.037
helping. helping everybody
but myself has made me

20
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.123
such a weak vessel for.
for men to just use.

21
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.625
and abuse. and. and hurt.

22
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.214
God.

23
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.133
Why didn't you just end my life

24
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.511
when I was in that
coma for three months?

25
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.059
(Mahogany sobs)

26
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:46.851
Tired.

27
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.194
And I know you. I know
you're happy. right?

28
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.781
You're happy to see me
suffer the way that I do.

29
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.116
(Mahogany laughs)

30
00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.827
(wine sloshing)

31
00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.454
But I am not you.

32
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.542
I'm not you.

33
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:12.711
You know.

34
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.882
everybody said you're this
mother. this great mom.

35
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.301
and. and. and a strong
woman. but you're not.

36
00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:25.974
You wouldn't even earn or
live up to your mistakes.

37
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.773
But I'm not gonna be like you.

38
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.526
and I refuse to be
what you said I was.

39
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:42.240
I miss my brother.
(frame clattering)

(Mahogany sobbing)

41
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.746
So. since everybody
got this whole idea

42
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.456
on. on how I'm supposed to be
(dramatic music)

43
00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.624
and. and. and this
big old woman of God.

44
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.043
and how I'm supposed
to treat people.

45
00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.129
then what I'm gonna do is just
end it all for all of you.

46
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.130
I'm tired.

47
00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.798
(dramatic music continues)

48
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.384
(Mahogany sobs)

49
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.306
And maybe that'll make
y'all happy for my brother.

50
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.100
(frame and container clattering)

51
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.226
I'm sick.

52
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.353
I'm tired.

53
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.566
You know. it's all
because. it's your fault.

54
00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:21.112
I changed my simple life for
you. and this is what I get.

55
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.324
So.

56
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.285
(pills rattling)

57
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.953
I'll take my life.

58
00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:29.788
(container thudding)

59
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:30.538
Tired.

60
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:36.086
(dramatic music continues)

61
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.171
(wine sloshing)

62
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.214
(hand knocking)

63
00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.049
Who the heck is this at my door?

64
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.300
And I know it's not you. God.

65
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.052
'cause you never
come to my rescue.

66
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.138
(wine sloshing)

67
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.849
Hmm. see who the heck this is.

68
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.686
Who is it?

69
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.270
Ooh. Jesus.

70
00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.773
(door clattering)

71
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.399
(door squeaking)

72
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.608
May I help you?

73
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.111
- Hello. um. I'm
Mrs. Celeste White.

74
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.321
You have missed a
couple of appointments.

75
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.781
We talked about a month ago.

76
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:08.493
- Um. appointments. what'd
you say your name was again?

77
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.661
- I'm Celeste White.

78
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.371
I'm a domestic violence advocate

79
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.124
down at the Crisis
Center on Market Street.

80
00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.083
Uh. can I come in?

81
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:15.917
Can we talk?

82
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.002
- I'm sorry. yes.

83
00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.503
Um. come on in.

84
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.218
(door squeaking)

85
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.386
Thank you. come on in.

86
00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.220
Excuse me.

87
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.304
Um. come on in.

88
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.557
Uh. excuse my house.

89
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.766
I was tidying up a bit.

90
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.643
and. uh. it normally
don't look like this.

91
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:34.894
I normally have it together.

92
00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.896
You can come into
my living room.

93
00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:41.234
- Um. if you want. I mean.
I can. I can come back.

94
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.445
but. um. this is
not a good time.

95
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.904
- Oh. no. it's-

96
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.406
- However. you did miss
some scheduled appointments.

97
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.283
so I was a little concerned
we didn't hear from you.

98
00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.993
- Scheduled appointments.

99
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.578
I'm sorry. Ms. White.
have a seat please.

100
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.539
And. and would you like
a. um. a glass of wine.

101
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.624
or some water. or. or something

102
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.418
to drink?
- Mm. no. no. thank you.

103
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.587
Um. like I mentioned. if
this is not a good time.

104
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.297
we can reschedule.

105
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.757
- No. it's fine.

106
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.842
Um. I just remembered
you're the woman I talked

107
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.511
to at the Crisis Center a
couple months ago. right?

108
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.721
- Yes.
- Okay.

109
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.639
- And you said that
you wanted help.

110
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.184
but you said you were in a
domestic violence situation.

111
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.352
Are you okay?

112
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.561
- I'm okay. but I wasn't

113
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.105
in a domestic
violence relationship.

114
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.775
I came to the center because
I wanted to kill someone

115
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.611
who I felt like hurt me
and my child to the point

116
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.654
that I really
wanted to kill him.

117
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.408
- Okay.

118
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.702
- So. you guys do house
calls now. Ms. White?

119
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.080
- Yeah. I mean we do.
especially if we feel

120
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.333
like somebody's in danger
or they need our help.

121
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.959
Um. excuse me for asking.

122
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.463
but you're not taking those
pills with alcohol. are you?

123
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.299
- No. these are prescribed
by my doctor. nosy.

124
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.053
and I left the lid
off last night.

125
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.346
(container thudding)

126
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.973
- Okay. well. again. uh.
the reason for my visit is

127
00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.475
that you had missed
several appointments

128
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.893
at the Crisis Center.

129
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.979
So. I'm here to follow
up on your case.

130
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.982
and we left messages. and you
didn't return any phone calls.

131
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:07.696
so it kind of raised a alarm.
and then it states here

132
00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:12.200
that you were in a bad marriage
and that you were trying

133
00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.785
to seek help to get a divorce

134
00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.454
before someone ended
up hurt or dead?

135
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.164
- No. no. no. no worries.

136
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.624
I'm outta that situation.

137
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.961
Um. but the reason
I came there was

138
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.964
because. you know. I mean I
always seem to find myself

139
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.508
in some type of failed
relationship. you know?

140
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.884
But I guess God spared his life

141
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.219
like he did the first marriage.

142
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:34.472
- Okay. so are you saying
that God spared his life

143
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.683
like the other relationships?

144
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:40.478
Um. were you in a domestic
violence relationship before?

145
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.647
- But this wasn't physical.

146
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:47.027
You know. this was mental
and. and. and spiritual.

147
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.320
- Oh. I'm sorry to hear
that. but I am glad

148
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.530
that you did get
out of that marriage

149
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.198
before somebody got hurt.

150
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.659
Um. if you don't mind.
can we talk about it.

151
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.494
and I can take some notes?
(paper rustling)

152
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.704
- Sure. no problem.

153
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.874
- All right. so what
drove you to the point

154
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.584
to where you wanted to
take another human life?

155
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.045
I mean. you did say
at the Crisis Center

156
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.588
it was life or death.

157
00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.052
Well. I mean we can
start from the beginning.

158
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.388
I mean. if you want. but we
can start with a little prayer.

159
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.473
- Ms. White. I don't know

160
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.683
how much God is
gonna listen to me.

161
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.560
You know. (sighs)
I've been calling

162
00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.480
on that man all my life.
and he has never answered.

163
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.065
- Mahogany. listen.

164
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:28.318
God hears all of our prayers
and all of our requests-

165
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.152
- Yeah. okay.

166
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.612
- known or unknown.

167
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.239
You just have to believe
and trust the process.

168
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.616
no matter what it is.

169
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.535
- Okay.

170
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.829
- Look. let's say a prayer.

171
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.540
God. we just ask that you
be on the. in the midst

172
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.792
of our conversation on the day.

173
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.544
In Jesus name we pray. amen.

174
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.379
- Thank you.

175
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.338
- All right.

176
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.589
(paper rustling)

177
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.174
So. let's start from
where you wanna begin.

178
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.763
- Well. I hope you got
enough pen and paper

179
00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.725
because. and the
time. because. um.

180
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.269
well. let me see. wanna
start when I was younger.

181
00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.773
uh. when I first would hear
that I was damaged goods.

182
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.776
- So. the abuse
started at a young age?

183
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.528
- Yeah. the first type of abuse

184
00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.782
that I experienced was
sexual. then mental.

185
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:20.912
physical. emotional.
and spiritual.

186
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.289
You know. any type of abuse
that you can experience.

187
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.666
I have experienced. Ms. White.

188
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.960
and then I became
the abuser myself.

189
00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.422
- So. what led you
to become the abuser?

190
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:35.802
I mean. tell me. you know.
what made you feel that way.

191
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.305
- Let me enlighten you. Ms.
White. on the hell I've been

192
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:43.518
through and the journey
of my life as an adult.

193
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.311
- Would you like to
talk about the marriage

194
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.813
that brought you to the center.

195
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.482
or do you wanna talk about the
one that made you the abuser?

196
00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.861
- Um. both. I guess.

197
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.489
Um. let's start when
I was first abused

198
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.450
and then when I
became the abuser.

199
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.786
- Okay. and how did this
make you feel. I mean.

200
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.122
to realize that you
were being abused.

201
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.666
but then you were
becoming that same person?

202
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:10.837
- Um. Ms. White. I ain't
always do things right.

203
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.132
but you know. I
felt like a monster.

204
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.343
I felt like I was
becoming like the.

205
00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.596
I was being like the ones
that hurt me. you know?

206
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:24.392
Um. and I was damaging a soul.

207
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.560
- And that's okay to admit.

208
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.519
You know why?

209
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.229
Because that's your truth.

210
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.647
- Oh.

211
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.691
- So. are you saying that
there were no male role models

212
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.693
in your life. I mean. like.
consistent to show you

213
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.236
any other type of love?

214
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:39.366
- No. I mean I had my father.
but he wasn't there like that.

215
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:44.454
Um. his drinking took over
him. and he was an alcoholic.

216
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.705
But the only love

217
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.415
that I ever truly felt
was from my brother.

218
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.877
and he was killed when I
was in my 20s. so I don't.

219
00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.713
there's no love and trust
that I had from a man.

220
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.757
- Okay. so that made
you. like. really scared

221
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.717
to receive love
from any other male?

222
00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.010
- Yeah.

223
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.512
- Let's. let's talk
about those things.

224
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.515
- What. about me being abused.
or when I was the abuser?

225
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.641
- Both.
(dramatic music)

226
00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:08.103
- Okay. well. (laughs)
let's just say

227
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:11.773
I didn't always do things
right. you know. um.

228
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.654
Uh. I was in this serious
domestic violence relationship

229
00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:18.780
with this guy.

230
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.657
You know. I thought
he was a good guy.

231
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:21.908
He paid for bills
and all of that.

232
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.078
My kids were like. what.
ages four. two. and one.

233
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.329
- Okay.

234
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.330
- They were too young
to understand. though.

235
00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.748
what was going on.

236
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.959
- So. was it their
father that abused you?

237
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:35.255
- No. I left his butt when my
last child was born. child.

238
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.590
He ain't want
nothing out of life.

239
00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.800
And I wanted more for my kids.

240
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.260
I wanted them to have
the best. you know.

241
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.386
things that I never had.

242
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:47.142
but the abuse that I had
endured. Ms. White. it was just.

243
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:49.686
it coulda ended my life.

244
00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.104
You know. I should have left

245
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.231
after the first
blow to the head.

246
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.441
(dramatic music)

247
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.692
(Mahogany groaning)

248
00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.736
- So. you think
you going leave me?

249
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:58.945
You must be out your
mind you think you

250
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.614
'bout to sneak outta
here without me knowing.

251
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.701
- Lemar. please stop licking me.

252
00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.453
Lemar. please.

253
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.079
My kids. they can't see this.

254
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.206
I can't allow them. please.

255
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.418
I don't want them to grow
up thinking this is normal.

256
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.338
- What. you think I'm not
good enough for your kids?

257
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.131
My money be feeding and
clothing them brats.

258
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.633
I put a roof over their
heads when they had nothing.

259
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:21.801
when you had nothing.

260
00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.012
when they dad didn't
do nothing for them.

261
00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.682
- No. please. I appreciate
everything you do for us.

262
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.477
I just. somebody's
gonna get hurt.

263
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.811
- So. you used me. trick.

264
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:32.729
(Mahogany whimpering)

265
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.857
- No. no.
(foot thudding)

266
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.234
(Mahogany screaming)
(fist thudding)

267
00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.486
- [Lemar] Let me
tell you something.

268
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.322
Get it through your
messed-up brain of yours.

269
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:43.823
I own you.

270
00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.158

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.869
much money as I spend up
on you and your kids trick.

272
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.832
- [Mahogany] (sobbing)
I can pay you back.

273
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.167
Please don't do this.

274
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.879
- You can double pay me back.
(Mahogany sobbing)

275
00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:02.425
Then again. you can
either with your blood

276
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.052
or your kids. one by one.

277
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:07.681
- But I stayed.

278
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.766
(fist thudding)
(Mahogany groaning)

279
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:12.310
- [Lemar] (laughs) Are
you really that stupid?

280
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.689
You believing in something
that you can't see?

281
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.857
Did your God ever
help you before?

282
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:20.151
Nah. (laughs)

283
00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.903
And he's not gonna help you now.

284
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.449
- Go ahead and beat me.

285
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.704
You're not gonna win since
you like beating women.

286
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.871
You're not gonna win.

287
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.540
- Nah. nah. nah. nah.

288
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.458
I'm not gonna kill you. (laughs)

289
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.377
But I will make you suffer.

290
00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.713
(Mahogany whimpering)

291
00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.381
Now. like I said. please me.

292
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.885
and you better not bite. or
I'm gonna blow your brains

293
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.846
out all over this place.

294
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.890
(Mahogany whimpering)

295
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:55.478
- (sobbing) Lemar.
please. please.

296
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.606
(Mahogany whimpering)

297
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.738
- [Celeste] So. how
long did you stay

298
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.157
in that domestic
violence relationship?

299
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.618
- For two years. I
endured that abuse.

300
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:15.040
and I had prayed to God
to give me a way out.

301
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.293
- Okay. so I mean you did
have a relationship with God.

302
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.004
- No. not really.
(gentle music)

303
00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.299
I just remember what my
grandmother would say to me

304
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:28.762
that if we pray. and if
we believe in our hearts

305
00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.348
that. you know. God
would answer our prayers

306
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:35.352
and. and see our tears.
and we just had to believe.

307
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.937
truly believe. and it
would come to pass.

308
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.191
- Yeah. well. I will say.
you had a wise grandmother

309
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.110
'cause that sounds like a
really crazy relationship

310
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.363
that you was getting ready
to get into with this man.

311
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:51.534
- It was. you know. and it
became more violent every day.

312
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.786
I had to fight every night.

313
00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.496
- Wow.
- And be forced

314
00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.872
to have sex in ways I hated.

315
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:56.998
- No.

316
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.877
- Like this one time. I remember

317
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.505
when this man beat me
so bad with a pistol

318
00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.715
that he broke my nose.

319
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:06.925
- So. how were you able to leave

320
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.386
that toxic domestic
violence relationship?

321
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.390
- This one night was
really different.

322
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.477
I had took my kids over
to my relative's house.

323
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.687
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

324
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.481
- And he had left his
gun at home by accident.

325
00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.941
- 'Kay.

326
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:27.654
- And I had said. "God. give
me a sign or gimme a way out.

327
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.158
and if you don't step in for me.

328
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.369
then it's gonna be
his life or mine."

329
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:36.996
- Oh. my God. you was
gonna take his life?

330
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.666
- I was so tired.
(gentle music continues)

331
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:43.336
I mean I was tired of
seeing the busted lips

332
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:47.048
and the black eyes. and I said.

333
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.427
"It's gonna be him or me."

334
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.219
- Mm.

335
00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.348
- I know I haven't
done everything right.

336
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.185
and I know I make mistakes.
(dramatic music)

337
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.062
and I'm not your
favorite person.

338
00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.315
but I need to ask you
something right now.

339
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:09.112
Lord. you said. my
grandmother always said.

340
00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.865
"If you wanna know if
God's word is real.

341
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.408
then give it back to him."

342
00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:17.328
So. I'm asking you.
is your word real?

343
00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.750
Because you said in Psalms 18:48

344
00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.504
and in 1:41 and. and four

345
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:31.217
and Jeremiah 15:21 and
2 Samuels 22 and 49

346
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:35.221
that you would deliver us
from the evils man hand

347
00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:40.643
and that you would rescue us
from the wicked man's hand.

348
00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.647
Lord. just like
you did for David

349
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.274
when he asked you to help him.

350
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:52.113
(sobbing) I'm asking you please.
please step in and help me.

351
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.241
I can't do this anymore. Lord.

352
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.953
I just wanna raise
my children right.

353
00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.705
(dramatic music continues)

354
00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.415
I just wanna serve you right.

355
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.586
Oh. I just don't want us
to depart from your word.

356
00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:13.218
Father. God. please just
manifest this for me. Jesus.

357
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.262
(Mahogany sobbing)

358
00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:18.640
Oh. God.

359
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.978
Either that's you coming to
get me. or that's that devil.

360
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.980
and he left his key out.

361
00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.440
It's 3:00 AM.

362
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:30.110
He shoulda just stayed
where he was at.

363
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.070
- Hello. ma'am.
your door was open.

364
00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.196
Are you Mahogany Noble?

365
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.115
- [Mahogany] Yes. I am.

366
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.616
Um. how can I help you?

367
00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.327
- Do you mind if I come in and
talk to you about Lemar Luv?

368
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.286
- Lemar?

369
00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.454
Yes. please come in.

370
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:42.622
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.749
- What's your
relations to Lemar?

372
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:48.128
- His girlfriend. but he
would say fiance. why?

373
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.045
Did he get locked up?

374
00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.130
I'm not coming to get his butt.

375
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.631
I'm tired of bailing him out.

376
00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.757
You could just keep him.

377
00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:54.843
- Ma'am. I'm sorry to tell you.

378
00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.136
but Lemar was killed last night.

379
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.345
- Killed?

380
00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.472
- This was the address
listed on his ID.

381
00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:00.515
- What?

382
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.101
Wait a minute.
who. what happened?

383
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:04.144
- He was shot multiple times

384
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.979
and pronounced
dead on the scene.

385
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.063
- Dead?

386
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.356
Do you got anybody in custody?

387
00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.025
Do you know who did this?

388
00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.151
- We do.

389
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.819
I can't give much
details. but it started

390
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.822
with an argument between
him and his brother-in-law.

391
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:18.450
and Mr. Stems took matters
into his own hands.

392
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.200
- What?

393
00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.245
My God. this is crazy.

394
00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.122
- Are you gonna be okay?

395
00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.790
Is there anyone here with you?

396
00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.085
- I'll be okay. but no.
there's no one here.

397
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:33.381
I. I'm by myself. but
I need to call his mom.

398
00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.426
Could you gimme
this time. please?

399
00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:37.052
- Yes.

400
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.261
- I can't believe-

401
00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:39.721
- Again. I'm sorry
for your loss.

402
00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.307
If you need anything. have
any questions. take this card.

403
00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.059
Contact Detective Morris.

404
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.185
(Mahogany exhales)

405
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.603
Again. I'm sorry for your loss.

406
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.273
- God.

407
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.441
(Mahogany sighs)

408
00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:52.484
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

409
00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.234
Jesus.

410
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:56.863
Thank you. Lord.

411
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.118
(Mahogany sobbing)

412
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.161
- [Celeste] So. how
did that make you feel

413
00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.913
to hear that Lemar got murdered?

414
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:10.335
- At first. I felt happy.
but as time went by.

415
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.295
I didn't know how
to feel. you know.

416
00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.839
I mean. watching his
children. and his mom.

417
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:21.054
and his siblings mourn over
him. it made me confused.

418
00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:24.516
But. um. (laughs) I felt like
I was the cause of him dying.

419
00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.642
- Why?

420
00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.435
- Because I had
prayed to God. I said.

421
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:29.938
"You better do something
about this man. or I will."

422
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.941
- Listen. you got to know you
had nothing to do with that.

423
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:37.195
Only God knows our departure
and our arrival on this Earth.

424
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.073
So. after that. what happened?

425
00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:43.368
- Well. I had became
this young. angry lady.

426
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:48.790
You know. I wanted someone to
pay for the pain. the hurt.

427
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.458
the lies. the abandonment.

428
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.876
the rape. the abuse.
(hands smacking)

429
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.129
I wanted someone to
pay for my angry tears.

430
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.422
- I understand
what you're saying.

431
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.424
but hurt people hurt people.

432
00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:01.177
I mean. so is that when you
felt like you became the abuser?

433
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.637
- Yes.

434
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.264
You know. I thought
I could love him.

435
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.141
but I couldn't allow
him in that space.

436
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.267
- Well. how could you love him

437
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.436
when you really
couldn't love yourself?

438
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.688
You never knew what real
love was. and I mean.

439
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.481
and you didn't even
get help for it.

440
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.276
- Yeah. but why would
I wanna afflict pain

441
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.944
on someone that was good?

442
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:21.448
- Well. the reason why
victims become victimizers is

443
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.950
because they're trying to get
their power and control back

444
00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:27.412
over their lives. and there's
a lack of social support

445
00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.581
and socioeconomic support.

446
00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.332
- You know. I truly
didn't understand that.

447
00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:34.586
I don't understand how I
could love someone and stay

448
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:37.589
in a relationship that long
with someone like that.

449
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.965
And I couldn't even love someone

450
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.134
that loved me and my children.

451
00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.969
- They call it
Stockholm syndrome.

452
00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:45.680
It's a condition they
call emotional attachment.

453
00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.266
You develop it as a
child. and you're looking

454
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.602
for love any way
you can receive it.

455
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.021
- So. I would want
to inflict pain

456
00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.648
for love or love for pain

457
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.567
and then become the abuser?
(gentle music)

458
00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.402
- Well. let's talk about
some of those things

459
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:02.197
that made you feel like
you became the abuser.

460
00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:05.116
- After Lemar's death. (laughs)

461
00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:07.369
you know. it became hard for me.

462
00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:11.456
but. um. I met this nice guy.

463
00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.500
and he was nice to
my children. too.

464
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:14.751
He didn't have any kids.

465
00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.045
so he treated mines
like they were his.

466
00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:18.296
- Awesome.

467
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:20.298
- (clicks tongue) And
couple months went by.

468
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.633
and we got a place together.

469
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:24.636
Things were going
good for a while.

470
00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:29.015
But my anger. it would
always get in the way.

471
00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:32.686
- Hmm. okay. so tell me
about some of those things

472
00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:33.561
that upset you.

473
00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:37.691
- Well. when he
didn't respect me.

474
00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:41.903
and I had to have control.
like this one time.

475
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:49.452
(door clattering)

476
00:22:57.127 --> 00:23:00.088
- I can't keep taking too
much of your abuse. Mahogany.

477
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.675
I mean. I gotta go to work
with marks and scratches

478
00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.343
on my face and arms.

479
00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:07.220
- Then. stop provoking me.
(brush clanking)

480
00:23:07.262 --> 00:23:09.639
You do some stupid
things sometimes.

481
00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:12.308
You know. I really think
something is wrong with you.

482
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.019
(Mahogany laughs)

483
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.936
I think you're slow.

484
00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:18.690
I don't even know why I
stay with you. Evander.

485
00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:19.899
You don't make me feel good.

486
00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:22.610
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. you
say that all the time.

487
00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:23.445
(laughing) "You don't
make me feel good."

488
00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:25.989
and yet you still here.

489
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:28.116
People always be asking
me why I allow you

490
00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:29.200
to treat me the way you do.

491
00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:32.203
- I care less what people say.

492
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:34.539
I don't care. You the one do.

493
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:35.874
Just leave. dang.

494
00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:40.211
I want someone else anyway.

495
00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:46.509
You don't make me feel good
with your non-dressing behind.

496
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:48.428
- I mean. I ain't
never hurt you.

497
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.474
I go to work. come home.
bring my check to you.

498
00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:53.391
I mean. what more do you want

499
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:54.976
from me?
- Everything.

500
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.103
You know what?

501
00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:59.314
I don't love you. Evander.

502
00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.149
I tolerate you.

503
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:02.817
My kids like you. for one thing.

504
00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:04.986
That's the only reason
why I'm with you.

505
00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:06.905
- You gonna regret that.

506
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.074
- Regret what. huh?

507
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:10.492
You threatening me?

508
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:12.744
You just like the
rest of them scums.

509
00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:14.412
- (laughing) I ain't nothing
like the rest of them.

510
00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:17.123
I truly care about you.
Mahogany. and the kids.

511
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:18.166
- Care? (laughs)

512
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:19.417
Love?

513
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.294
You wouldn't even know
what those words are.

514
00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:23.088
They're lies. Evander.

515
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:25.423
- It's true.

516
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:28.218
Mahogany. you need anger
management and counseling.

517
00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:29.636
I mean. I'll go with you.

518
00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:31.596
- What you're trying
to say. I'm crazy?

519
00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:34.140
Boy. I will cut you.
(dramatic music)

520
00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:34.891
Believe that.

521
00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:37.477
- Man. this violence
got to stop.

522
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.436
The kids watching this and all.

523
00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:40.480
You know this ain't right.

524
00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:43.900
- I will break every
bone in your dang body

525
00:24:43.942 --> 00:24:47.487
if you ever think about
turning my kids against me.

526
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:48.988
Hate your stupid crazy butt.

527
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.574
You're not even
my type. Evander.

528
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:52.659
You're too weak. for one.

529
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:53.993
- Then. let me leave.

530
00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:58.123
I ain't trying to
get you upset. man.

531
00:24:58.164 --> 00:24:59.416
You need anything while I'm out?

532
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.084
- No. I don't need you
getting me anything

533
00:25:01.126 --> 00:25:02.377
with your dumb. stupid butt.

534
00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:04.295
You ain't gonna bring back
the right things anyway.

535
00:25:04.337 --> 00:25:05.505
Just leave me the money.

536
00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:07.048
I'll get it myself.
(dramatic music continues)

537
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.509
Brush your teeth before
you try to kiss me.

538
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:10.844
- Someday. you gonna regret
the way you treat me.

539
00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:13.471
- You just leave so a good
man can come up in here

540
00:25:13.513 --> 00:25:15.015
and deal with me?
- Everything you said

541
00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:17.017
about you being abused.

542
00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:19.352
look in the mirror
for once. Mahogany.

543
00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:20.770
- Look in the mirror?

544
00:25:20.812 --> 00:25:23.356
You always in the mirror
abandoned with your sissy self.

545
00:25:23.398 --> 00:25:24.774
(door slamming)

546
00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:28.236
- So. how long did the physical
and mental abuse go on?

547
00:25:28.278 --> 00:25:31.197
I mean. were you able to get
help for your anger problems?

548
00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:32.615
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

549
00:25:32.657 --> 00:25:37.579
- 13 years. this was the
longest relationship I had had.

550
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.832
You know. I cheated on him.
and he stayed. (laughs)

551
00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:45.503
My dad. my mom. my
brother had died.

552
00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:46.755
and he still stayed.

553
00:25:48.298 --> 00:25:51.551
I had blamed him like he was
the one that killed them.

554
00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:52.802
and he stayed.

555
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.763
- Hmm.

556
00:25:54.804 --> 00:25:56.514
Well. it sounds like. I
mean. like he loved you.

557
00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:59.934
and he cared for you. so
what broke you guys up?

558
00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:03.521
- I guess he got tired of
the way I was treating him.

559
00:26:03.563 --> 00:26:07.275
and he cheated on me
with my friend's sister.

560
00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:09.235
so I dumped his butt.

561
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:10.403
- But wait a minute.

562
00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:14.240
I mean. you did say
that you cheated on him.

563
00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:16.785
and he still stayed. and
you couldn't forgive him?

564
00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:19.579
- It was different. Ms. White.

565
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.456
I. I can't explain it.

566
00:26:21.498 --> 00:26:23.583
All I know I didn't want him.

567
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:26.336
but I didn't want
anyone else to have him.

568
00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:27.170
(Celeste clicks tongue)

569
00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:28.546
- You know what I think?

570
00:26:28.588 --> 00:26:32.926
I think. deep down inside.
you knew he was a good man.

571
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:36.846
You knew that he loved you.
and he loved those kids.

572
00:26:36.888 --> 00:26:41.434
and you were too afraid
to open up and let him in.

573
00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:42.977
(dramatic music continues)

574
00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:46.523
- I believe I just wanted
someone to pay for the pain

575
00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:48.692
that I had been
enduring. you know?

576
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.946
So. this man rescued
me and my kids.

577
00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:57.951
but I mentally and
physically abused him.

578
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.787
- Okay. so how did
that make you feel

579
00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:03.206
to face that you
were the abuser?

580
00:27:03.248 --> 00:27:05.291
I mean. did that give
you some type of control

581
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:07.419
or. or power over your life?

582
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.712
- I thought it would. but no.

583
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:11.464
it. it. it made me feel
like all the monsters

584
00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:16.511
that had hurt me. you know.
that I was no better than them

585
00:27:16.553 --> 00:27:18.263
because I was damaging a soul.

586
00:27:20.056 --> 00:27:21.808
And this man. I just didn't know

587
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.768
how to love him the
way he loved me.

588
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.191
- And you know what. that's
okay because that's your truth.

589
00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:32.235
I mean. I just felt
like you wasn't ready

590
00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:34.612
to receive those feelings.

591
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:36.781
Were you able to get
help with the abuse?

592
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:40.076
(dramatic music continues)

593
00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:43.455
- No. I mean. I had been
in counseling all my life.

594
00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:44.831
and it's never helped.

595
00:27:44.873 --> 00:27:47.334
All they do is just
drug you with medicine

596
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.586
that do not ease the pain.

597
00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:50.378
It don't go away.

598
00:27:52.547 --> 00:27:54.382
So. after three years alone.

599
00:27:55.592 --> 00:27:57.927
I decided to go and
get back in church

600
00:27:57.969 --> 00:28:00.138
because I wanted my
children to get a foundation

601
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.515
just like my
grandmother had gave me.

602
00:28:02.557 --> 00:28:03.516
- Okay. all right. that's great.

603
00:28:03.558 --> 00:28:05.226
I mean. so did that help?

604
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:08.855
- Well. do you want
something to drink.

605
00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:10.732
a bottle of water or something?

606
00:28:10.774 --> 00:28:13.568
Because what I'm gonna tell
you is gonna shock you.

607
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.778
- Okay. you know what?

608
00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:15.904
I'm gonna take you up
on that bottle of water.

609
00:28:15.945 --> 00:28:17.322
Is it okay if I
take off my jacket?

610
00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:18.281
- Yeah.

611
00:28:18.323 --> 00:28:19.282
- Okay.
- Be right back.

612
00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:20.367
- All right.
- All right.

613
00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:23.703
(jacket rustling)

614
00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:26.331
(Celeste sighs)

615
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:31.836
(paper rustling)

616
00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:36.341
(dramatic music continues)

617
00:28:36.383 --> 00:28:37.634
Here you go. sweetie.

618
00:28:37.676 --> 00:28:38.885
- Oh. thank you.

619
00:28:38.927 --> 00:28:39.928
- [Mahogany] Mm-hmm.

620
00:28:39.969 --> 00:28:41.012
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

621
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:42.222
- Um. so you made-
- Ooh.

622
00:28:42.263 --> 00:28:45.600
- mention. um. that
you got back in church?

623
00:28:45.642 --> 00:28:47.769
- Mm-hmm. I did.

624
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:50.355
And I had gotten into
a new relationship

625
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:54.109
with this guy that had
invited me to his church.

626
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.069
- All right. that's
good. spiritual help.

627
00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:59.864
All right. so I mean. how
did that work out for you?

628
00:28:59.906 --> 00:29:02.701
- It was the worst mistake
that I could have made.

629
00:29:02.742 --> 00:29:03.993
- [Celeste] Oh.

630
00:29:04.035 --> 00:29:05.954
- After one year of
being in this church.

631
00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:09.666
this man had invited
me over to his house

632
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.835
to watch a movie. you know?

633
00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:17.924
And he. he seemed nice.
and he seemed harmless.

634
00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.883
- And what. I mean.
what do you mean?

635
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:20.635
What happened?

636
00:29:20.677 --> 00:29:21.970
- You know. this church
that I thought was

637
00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:27.600
my rescue village end up
having to arrange a marriage

638
00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:28.393
between me and this guy

639
00:29:29.644 --> 00:29:31.855
to cover up something
bad that had happened.

640
00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:33.356
- Arrange marriage?

641
00:29:33.398 --> 00:29:34.691
How?

642
00:29:34.733 --> 00:29:37.360
I mean. how did you even
end up married to this guy?

643
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:41.698
- The pastor had to cover
up the crime of rape.

644
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.615
- Oh. my God. he raped you?

645
00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:43.825
- Yes.

646
00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:45.660
I mean the night that
I went over there

647
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:47.120
to watch the movie with him.

648
00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:49.956
he had. he had put something.
some kind of date-rape drug

649
00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:51.583
in my. in my drink.

650
00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:52.584
- Oh. my God.

651
00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:53.793
I mean. did you tell a pastor?

652
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:56.463
I mean. did you. did
you tell anyone else?

653
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.048
- I went to the pastor.

654
00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:02.177
and he said it's
best that we marry

655
00:30:03.178 --> 00:30:06.306
because we don't take
our affairs to the law.

656
00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:07.515
We deal with them.

657
00:30:07.557 --> 00:30:08.975
And that's what the
Bible was teaching us.

658
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:11.811
I was told. if I
disobeyed the pastor.

659
00:30:11.853 --> 00:30:13.188
and if I went over his head.

660
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:16.816
that me and my children
would be punished.

661
00:30:16.858 --> 00:30:18.526
and we would burn in hell.

662
00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:25.825
He would always quote this
scripture from Hebrews 13.

663
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.118
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.995
- And it would say. "Obey
those that have ruled

665
00:30:29.037 --> 00:30:30.997
over your. your soul." you know.

666
00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:35.502
because they have to take
account to what we say and do.

667
00:30:35.543 --> 00:30:36.795
- That's crazy.

668
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:38.213
I mean. I mean. I'm
not gonna talk ill

669
00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:40.340
of a man of the
cloth or anything.

670
00:30:40.382 --> 00:30:43.259
but. um. yeah. that
was definitely a crime.

671
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:46.179
And that's truly out of
context to fit their logic.

672
00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:48.515
- (clicks tongue) Yeah.
I would say so. too.

673
00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:50.141
I mean I understand that now

674
00:30:50.183 --> 00:30:53.478
that I'm studying and
reading the word for myself.

675
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.022
- So. how long did you
stay in that marriage?

676
00:30:56.064 --> 00:30:58.775
- I stayed in that
relationship five years.

677
00:30:58.817 --> 00:31:03.363
and I endured mental. spiritual.

678
00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:05.407
and emotional abuse.

679
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:06.741
- Mm.

680
00:31:06.783 --> 00:31:10.578
- He had isolated me from
my family and my friends.

681
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.538
- Wow.

682
00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:12.706
- I couldn't deal with nobody

683
00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:13.957
unless they was
inside that church.

684
00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:16.251
- So. so what about
your children?

685
00:31:17.502 --> 00:31:20.755
- He had convinced me
that my children were evil

686
00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:22.382
and that they were from Satan.

687
00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:23.466
- What?
- I mean.

688
00:31:23.508 --> 00:31:24.676
anybody that wasn't
in their circle.

689
00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:28.179
- That had to have
been hard to deal with.

690
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:29.055
- It was.

691
00:31:30.223 --> 00:31:32.475
I was trying to be
obedient. you know.

692
00:31:32.517 --> 00:31:35.311
to what the word of God says
because I was in training

693
00:31:35.353 --> 00:31:38.815
to be a minister's wife.
you know. (scoffs) stupid.

694
00:31:38.857 --> 00:31:40.400
- So. you thought being isolated

695
00:31:40.442 --> 00:31:42.861
from your loved ones
and your children.

696
00:31:42.902 --> 00:31:45.280
that would help you get
acceptance from God?

697
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:47.407
(dramatic music)
- Yes. in a way

698
00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:48.700
because I was doomed.

699
00:31:48.742 --> 00:31:51.745
You know. I was. I
was damaged goods.

700
00:31:51.786 --> 00:31:53.455
You know. I was feeling trapped.

701
00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:58.918
I started asking God. "Is this
your way of punishing me?"

702
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.628
- You really think God
would punish you like that?

703
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.591
- Yeah. I mean. I was already
doomed and damaged goods.

704
00:32:04.632 --> 00:32:05.925
You know. ever since
I was a little girl.

705
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:08.011
that's all I've been told.

706
00:32:08.053 --> 00:32:08.845
- You know what?

707
00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:10.096
Let's go back.

708
00:32:10.138 --> 00:32:11.931
Let's talk about the
arranged marriage.

709
00:32:11.973 --> 00:32:13.266
(dramatic music continues)

710
00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:15.977
- Ms. White. let's start
with the mind control.

711
00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:18.146
- Mm.

712
00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:22.609
(footsteps plodding)

713
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.443
(paper rustling)

714
00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:24.861
(book thudding)

715
00:32:24.903 --> 00:32:26.946
- I know those aren't
jeans you're wearing.

716
00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:28.865
What type of wife are you?

717
00:32:28.907 --> 00:32:30.367
(Rasalas laughs)

718
00:32:30.408 --> 00:32:32.077
See. I knew I should have
married Sister Aquilla.

719
00:32:32.118 --> 00:32:35.580
She knew how to be
obedient and a good wife.

720
00:32:35.622 --> 00:32:36.831
I hope you read those scriptures

721
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:38.958
I left for you on
the kitchen table.

722
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.419
- Then. maybe you should
have married her. God.

723
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.092
because you know that
this is not right.

724
00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:52.555
What type of God makes you
marry a man that rapes you?

725
00:32:52.597 --> 00:32:53.848
(Rasalas scoffs)

726
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.433
- So. playing the
victim card again?

727
00:32:55.475 --> 00:32:57.644
How many times you
gonna keep crying wolf?

728
00:32:59.688 --> 00:33:00.980
- Crying wolf?

729
00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.483
Are you serious right now?

730
00:33:03.525 --> 00:33:06.361
You and the pastor
know that you raped me

731
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:09.030
and brainwashed me to believe

732
00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:12.659
that you truly loved
me and my kids.

733
00:33:12.701 --> 00:33:15.495
and if we didn't obey
you or obey the pastor.

734
00:33:15.537 --> 00:33:17.372
then we would go
straight to hell.

735
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:21.042
- First off. you came to
the church already damaged.

736
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:23.837
Or. did you forget about all
those testimonies you gave

737
00:33:23.878 --> 00:33:25.171
about how you were a loose woman

738
00:33:25.213 --> 00:33:28.258
and had all those men and
boys run up inside you?

739
00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:29.300
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

740
00:33:29.342 --> 00:33:30.051
- Really?

741
00:33:31.511 --> 00:33:35.056
So. you take my past and my
pain. and you use it against.

742
00:33:35.098 --> 00:33:37.350
and child abuse and
use it against me?

743
00:33:37.392 --> 00:33:38.852
God.

744
00:33:38.893 --> 00:33:41.229
- Once a harlot.
always a harlot.

745
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:43.023
doesn't matter what
age they start.

746
00:33:43.064 --> 00:33:43.857
(Rasalas scoffs)

747
00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:45.066
I mean. look at you.

748
00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:47.694
I cleaned you up to the
woman you are today.

749
00:33:47.736 --> 00:33:49.988
So. instead of claiming.
you should be thanking me

750
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.032
and pastor for saving
your reputation

751
00:33:52.073 --> 00:33:53.783
from being the whore
that your mother was.

752
00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:58.288
- My pain of my past and
who my mother was gives you

753
00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:01.041
a right to force yourself on me?

754
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:02.375
(Rasalas scoffs)

755
00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:05.628
- See. first off. you know
you wanted it that night.

756
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:10.383
coming over to my apartment
with those tight jeans on.

757
00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:11.176
and it was dark.

758
00:34:12.344 --> 00:34:14.012
Look like your body
was just begging me

759
00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:16.389
to take those clothes
off and give it to you.

760
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:18.767
- The only thing that
I was right about.

761
00:34:19.934 --> 00:34:21.978
and you got that right.
(dramatic music)

762
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.230
was coming over to your
house alone believing

763
00:34:24.272 --> 00:34:26.524
that you were a true man of God.

764
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.029
You know that you
forced yourself on me.

765
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:34.199
And when a woman
says. no. Rasalas.

766
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.243
that doesn't give you the right
to force yourself on them.

767
00:34:37.285 --> 00:34:39.037
(dramatic music continues)

768
00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:40.789
You know that you drugged me.

769
00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:47.087
- In Philippians 3:13.
I believe it tells us

770
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:50.298
to forget those things
that are behind you.

771
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.094
And in Hebrews 13:17. it says.

772
00:34:54.135 --> 00:34:57.097
to obey those who
have rule over you.

773
00:34:57.138 --> 00:35:01.101
And let's not forget
the main course.

774
00:35:01.142 --> 00:35:02.811
since you are my wife.
(paper rustling)

775
00:35:02.852 --> 00:35:04.062
And this will apply

776
00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:06.272
for the next time you
reject me in the bed.

777
00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:09.943
First Corinthians
4 and 7. it says.

778
00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:11.528
"Your body is mine.

779
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:15.990
It belongs to me now. and I
will have it when I want it.

780
00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:18.493
(book thudding)

781
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:22.288
- You will always have
to take it. Rasalas.

782
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.541
because you know that
this is not right.

783
00:35:24.582 --> 00:35:26.960
You know. all the studying
you've been having me do

784
00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.753
for you is teaching me

785
00:35:28.795 --> 00:35:30.547
that the. that the
word of God is right.

786
00:35:30.588 --> 00:35:33.967
and what they're teaching
down at that church is wrong.

787
00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:35.135
(dramatic music continues)

788
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:38.263
- See. I see why
your mother left you.

789
00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:40.640
You must be stupid to
think you can outwin me

790
00:35:40.682 --> 00:35:41.599
in the word of God.

791
00:35:42.767 --> 00:35:44.227
Next time you wanna
look at a scripture.

792
00:35:44.269 --> 00:35:47.313
look at 1 Corinthians 14 and 34.

793
00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:50.984
It says. "The woman
should be silent

794
00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:53.153
and should not be
permitted to speak

795
00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:56.156
but to be in submission. and
she should ask the husband

796
00:35:56.197 --> 00:35:57.949
what she should learn."

797
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.367
(dramatic music continues)

798
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:04.873
- When I get one I will because
you are a true imposter.

799
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.167
- Just have my notes ready
for my sermon on Sunday

800
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:09.711
and don't have me
looking stupid like you.

801
00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:13.131
- That's what I'm doing now.
(footsteps plodding)

802
00:36:13.173 --> 00:36:16.259
(dramatic music continues)

803
00:36:16.301 --> 00:36:17.677
(paper rustling)

804
00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:21.014
- So. you saying that he
controlled you with the Bible

805
00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:22.724
and talked down to you?

806
00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:24.601
I mean. how did
that make you feel?

807
00:36:24.642 --> 00:36:26.936
- It made me feel
like. like I was wrong

808
00:36:26.978 --> 00:36:30.190
for thinking the way I was
and feeling the way I were.

809
00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:30.982
You know. because

810
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.238
maybe I was confusing

811
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.493
the rape from my past. you
know. that it wasn't rape.

812
00:36:41.534 --> 00:36:44.704
and maybe I was wrong for
going over there that night.

813
00:36:44.746 --> 00:36:48.708
- No. Mahogany. listen.
if a woman tells a man no.

814
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.044
then no means no.
(dramatic music continues)

815
00:36:51.086 --> 00:36:52.379
That doesn't mean
that he has the right

816
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.755
to take advantage of you.

817
00:36:53.797 --> 00:36:56.466
And I don't care what
the circumstances were.

818
00:36:56.508 --> 00:37:00.178
He does not have a right
to violate that word no.

819
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.805
- It was just like
he was saying.

820
00:37:01.846 --> 00:37:05.016
Mahogany. don't concentrate
on the actions of your past

821
00:37:05.058 --> 00:37:07.018
but concentrate on our marriage.

822
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.687
But I couldn't
get past thinking.

823
00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:11.231
what decent man
would want a woman

824
00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:13.525
who was considered
damaged goods?

825
00:37:13.566 --> 00:37:16.403
You know. like. I wasn't pure.

826
00:37:16.444 --> 00:37:18.279
I wasn't a virgin anymore.

827
00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:20.240
It was like God
was punishing me.

828
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:23.201
- Mahogany. God does not
punish us by allowing us to be

829
00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:25.578
in relationships
that's unhealthy.

830
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.581
All that does is damage
us and make it worse.

831
00:37:29.624 --> 00:37:32.043
Look. what we need to do
is acknowledge and deal

832
00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:36.631
with our past and our failures.
and address those actions

833
00:37:36.673 --> 00:37:39.050
of pain from the
people that hurt us.

834
00:37:39.092 --> 00:37:43.763
And once we do that. we can
move on. forgive. and let go.

835
00:37:44.973 --> 00:37:47.976
- Well. right now I feel
like my lesson from that was

836
00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:50.937
to. "Mahogany.
protect yourself."

837
00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:52.230
- Mm-hmm.
- "Guard yourself."

838
00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:53.523
- Mm-hmm.
- Because there are churches

839
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.818
out here that will turn a
deaf ear and a blind eye

840
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.111
to what is going on.

841
00:37:58.153 --> 00:38:01.239
especially when it has to
do with abuse. you know?

842
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:03.450
They'll protect theirselves.

843
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:08.079
- Wow. okay. so how long did
you stay with Minister Rasalas?

844
00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:11.541
- (scoffs) Five years. and after
five years of mental abuse.

845
00:38:11.583 --> 00:38:13.752
plus our financials had changed.

846
00:38:13.793 --> 00:38:14.878
- [Celeste] Hmm.

847
00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:15.962
- You know. the
pastor would tell him.

848
00:38:16.004 --> 00:38:17.964
"Give her $50 every two weeks.

849
00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:18.882
She'll be fine.

850
00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:20.425
You pay all the bills."

851
00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:24.137
- So. you mean the pastor
would coach your husband

852
00:38:24.179 --> 00:38:25.347
on y'all's finances?

853
00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:27.223
- He would also pull me
in the office to talk

854
00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:31.519
about our sex life and. and say.

855
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:35.148
"This is what you need to
do to please your husband."

856
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.776
and not to deny him my body.

857
00:38:37.817 --> 00:38:40.236
- So. I know that had to
be uncomfortable talking

858
00:38:40.278 --> 00:38:42.655
to the pastor about what
goes on in your bedroom.

859
00:38:42.697 --> 00:38:45.033
- It was because I hated it.

860
00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:46.326
You know. it wasn't love.

861
00:38:46.368 --> 00:38:49.329
This was rape. and I felt
like he was raping me

862
00:38:49.371 --> 00:38:50.830
over and over again.

863
00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:52.832
You know. like. it.
like. he was just using

864
00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:53.792
the bathroom on me.

865
00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:55.293
I hated it.

866
00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:57.837
- I am so sorry you had
to endure that. Mahogany.

867
00:38:59.172 --> 00:39:01.341
But listen. God loves you.

868
00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:03.134
He's been with you
the whole time.

869
00:39:03.176 --> 00:39:05.220
and he wants you
to be delivered.

870
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:08.098
and I really believe
he sent me here.

871
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:09.557
(gentle music)

872
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.060
- I wanna believe that. and I
wanna receive that from you.

873
00:39:12.102 --> 00:39:16.189
But it's just hard to say
that or believe that for me

874
00:39:16.231 --> 00:39:21.194
because I. too. I pray.
I pray. and I pray.

875
00:39:21.236 --> 00:39:23.405
and I try to live the right way.

876
00:39:23.446 --> 00:39:25.323
- I totally agree with
what you're saying.

877
00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:26.866
You know why?

878
00:39:26.908 --> 00:39:30.120
Because what you don't know
is that I. too. was abused.

879
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:31.371
- What?

880
00:39:31.413 --> 00:39:35.417
- By my own father. his
neighbors. his friends.

881
00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:39.337
and that went on from
ages 10 to 18 years old.

882
00:39:39.379 --> 00:39:40.839
I had to deal with that.

883
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.299
My mother. she abandoned me
and my brother for drugs.

884
00:39:43.341 --> 00:39:44.300
She left us.

885
00:39:44.342 --> 00:39:45.760
- I'm sorry.

886
00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:49.305
- My father. he was our
only caretaker at that time.

887
00:39:49.347 --> 00:39:53.351
So. listen. our story
will help men and women

888
00:39:53.393 --> 00:39:55.395
to break those chains.

889
00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:56.563
- Yeah.
- I mean.

890
00:39:56.604 --> 00:39:58.314
but can you just tell
me how did you get

891
00:39:58.356 --> 00:40:00.358
the strength to leave?

892
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.320
- Well. (clears
throat) wasn't easy.

893
00:40:04.362 --> 00:40:05.530
(dramatic music)

894
00:40:05.572 --> 00:40:09.492
And Minister Rasalas was
not pleased. you know.

895
00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:13.663
You know. this man had went
as far as to kidnap me.

896
00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:16.124
to drug me. stalk me.

897
00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:20.628
He even. (sighs) they
couldn't find out what it was

898
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.088
that he drugged me with.

899
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.341
It was some kind of
unknown street substance.

900
00:40:24.382 --> 00:40:26.634
- You have a true testimony.

901
00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:29.512
and this is a movie that we
could share with the world.

902
00:40:30.805 --> 00:40:33.099
Can you tell me a little bit
more. though. about the events

903
00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:34.392
that took place?

904
00:40:34.434 --> 00:40:37.479
- I can remember my cousin.
Starla. she came over.

905
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.773
and she was trying to
help me find a place

906
00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:42.609
'cause I was leaving Minister
Rasalas. and like I said.

907
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.527
he wasn't pleased about it.

908
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:46.988
But this one night.
(dramatic music)

909
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.407
if she wouldn't have
found me when she did.

910
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:52.535
I wouldn't even be here
to tell my story today.

911
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:57.082
(footsteps plodding)
(dramatic music)

912
00:40:57.123 --> 00:40:57.832
Hey.

913
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.795
(bag thudding)

914
00:41:04.381 --> 00:41:07.509
(chair clattering)

915
00:41:09.803 --> 00:41:11.680
- I hope you enjoy your meal.

916
00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:13.473
I tried to get
all your favorites

917
00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:16.017
from your favorite restaurant.

918
00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:17.185
(Mahogany laughs)

919
00:41:17.227 --> 00:41:19.896
- Well. thank you. this
was a nice gesture.

920
00:41:19.938 --> 00:41:22.399
But. um. this still
doesn't change anything.

921
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.068
As soon as I find
a place. leaving.

922
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:27.404
- I understand.

923
00:41:27.445 --> 00:41:30.156
I just wanted to
do something nice

924
00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:34.452
and to tell you that I
believe you're right.

925
00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:37.664
I do need to actually
read God's word.

926
00:41:38.707 --> 00:41:41.543
and. um. hopefully me and
you can study the Bible

927
00:41:41.584 --> 00:41:43.503
when you. before you leave.

928
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:47.215
- So. now you want to
hear what God got to say?

929
00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.508
(Mahogany laughs)

930
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.594
Okay. but I guess it's
better late than never.

931
00:41:51.636 --> 00:41:54.514
Um. but I thought that
you were prohibited

932
00:41:54.556 --> 00:41:56.516
from the pastor
in drinking wine.

933
00:41:56.558 --> 00:41:57.559
I mean.

934
00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:04.482
- Well. like you
said. to actually read
what God is saying.

935
00:42:04.524 --> 00:42:07.944
And. um. I believe
it said in. um.

936
00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:13.992
1 Timothy 5:23. says
to have a little wine

937
00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:15.201
to settle the
stomach and to help

938
00:42:15.243 --> 00:42:17.037
with all other infirmities.

939
00:42:17.078 --> 00:42:18.204
(Mahogany laughs)

940
00:42:18.246 --> 00:42:20.540
- Wait. so what was
that scripture you used

941
00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:22.042
to beat me down
with all the time

942
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:24.919
when I would have a glass
of wine once a month only?

943
00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:27.547
And it was for the reasons
that you would say Rasalas.

944
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:29.716
to settle my stomach
because when I would eat

945
00:42:29.758 --> 00:42:32.135
certain sauces. they
would hurt my stomach.

946
00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:34.346
and I would have a
glass of wine only.

947
00:42:35.764 --> 00:42:38.058
And I believe that that
was in Galatians. actually.

948
00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:40.894
where you would beat me down
and say that it was impure.

949
00:42:40.935 --> 00:42:46.733
um. that I was wicked. uh.
that I was envious of you.

950
00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:48.568
- I apologize for that.

951
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.153
I was wrong.

952
00:42:50.195 --> 00:42:53.490
That's why I'm having a
glass of wine with you.

953
00:42:53.531 --> 00:42:56.284
And. um. the guy that
sold it to me said

954
00:42:56.326 --> 00:43:00.914
that this was a very nice.
smooth. sweet red wine.

955
00:43:00.955 --> 00:43:02.999
and. uh. hope you enjoy it.

956
00:43:04.209 --> 00:43:07.545
- Well. I'm glad that you're
reading your scriptures

957
00:43:07.587 --> 00:43:10.715
for yourself now. but
read that chapter again

958
00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:12.884
because that was actually
Galatians 19 and 20

959
00:43:12.926 --> 00:43:16.388
or verses five. chapter
5. verses 19 and 21

960
00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:20.141
where it actually speaks of the
same reason you just stated.

961
00:43:20.183 --> 00:43:21.726
why I would drink that wine.

962
00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:23.770
(gentle music)

963
00:43:23.812 --> 00:43:26.981
- Well. let's just
enjoy our meal.

964
00:43:27.023 --> 00:43:28.733
and I hope you like the flowers.

965
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:31.528
- They're nice.

966
00:43:31.569 --> 00:43:32.320
Thank you.

967
00:43:33.655 --> 00:43:35.490
But this doesn't
change anything.

968
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:39.077
(gentle music continues)

969
00:43:46.501 --> 00:43:49.421
(dramatic music)

970
00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:55.260
- Mahogany. Mahogany. Mahogany.

971
00:43:57.846 --> 00:43:59.055
What in the world?

972
00:44:01.558 --> 00:44:04.728
(buttons clicking)

973
00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:06.479
Hello.

974
00:44:06.521 --> 00:44:07.522
- [Dispatcher] 911. what's-
- Hello.

975
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:08.732
- [Dispatcher] your emergency?

976
00:44:08.773 --> 00:44:11.818
- Yes. I need someone
at 557 Tenderlane Drive.

977
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.237
My cousin is on the
floor and not responding.

978
00:44:16.114 --> 00:44:17.157
I don't know.

979
00:44:19.159 --> 00:44:19.951
What is CRP?

980
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.705
Whatever. CPR.

981
00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:26.249
No. I'm not a
doctor nor a nurse.

982
00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:27.125
Just hurry.

983
00:44:27.792 --> 00:44:30.420
Mahogany. (exhales)

984
00:44:30.462 --> 00:44:33.048
(air whooshing)

985
00:44:34.382 --> 00:44:37.469
Mahogany. are you sure
you should be here?

986
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.179
'Cause I don't trust this dude.

987
00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.847
And where did he go?

988
00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:42.432
- I don't. I don't know
where he's at right now.

989
00:44:42.474 --> 00:44:43.933
And I don't care.

990
00:44:43.975 --> 00:44:46.436
He ain't gonna come back here
after he found out I survived.

991
00:44:46.478 --> 00:44:49.689
I just gotta find that bottle
of wine and have it tested.

992
00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:50.815
What in the world?

993
00:44:52.442 --> 00:44:53.526
Wait a minute.

994
00:44:53.568 --> 00:44:54.986
(fingers tapping)

995
00:44:55.028 --> 00:44:56.363
What happened to the bottle
of wine. Starla. and the food.

996
00:44:56.404 --> 00:44:58.281
and the flowers that was
on that table right there?

997
00:44:59.574 --> 00:45:01.368
- There was nothing
on the table.

998
00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:04.204
The door was unlocked.
and I only came over here

999
00:45:04.245 --> 00:45:06.456
because you didn't
answer your phone.

1000
00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:07.832
(Mahogany sighs)

1001
00:45:07.874 --> 00:45:10.710
- No. there was food. these
plates. a bottle of wine.

1002
00:45:10.752 --> 00:45:12.379
and flowers on that table.

1003
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.922
I know he drugged me.

1004
00:45:13.963 --> 00:45:15.423
(dramatic music continues)

1005
00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:17.133
- When them doctors came in
after they pumped your stomach

1006
00:45:17.175 --> 00:45:19.719
and asked were you on
drugs. I wanted to cut him

1007
00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:21.137
with his own scalpel.

1008
00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:24.140
Like. just because you Black.
you gotta be doing drugs.

1009
00:45:24.182 --> 00:45:25.266
- Yeah. right.

1010
00:45:25.308 --> 00:45:26.685
But they did find.
say that they found

1011
00:45:26.726 --> 00:45:30.730
some kinda. um. unknown
street drug in my system.

1012
00:45:30.772 --> 00:45:33.024
I just gotta find
proof to press charges.

1013
00:45:34.275 --> 00:45:36.986
But thank God you came in and
found me when you did. cuz.

1014
00:45:37.028 --> 00:45:39.531
- Hmm. I wish I
could find this dude.

1015
00:45:39.572 --> 00:45:41.074
This is not cool. Mahogany.

1016
00:45:41.116 --> 00:45:43.076
You need to get
outta this right now

1017
00:45:43.118 --> 00:45:46.746
because him and that church
is on some Jim Jones mess.

1018
00:45:46.788 --> 00:45:49.624
Next. they'd be doing
you like Jeffrey Dahmer.

1019
00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:51.543
crap and cook you.

1020
00:45:51.584 --> 00:45:53.712
- Cuz. you. you
watch too much TV.

1021
00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:55.964
- No. I am serious.

1022
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:58.174
They all look crazy
at that church.

1023
00:45:58.216 --> 00:46:00.760
It's like they robots
at that program

1024
00:46:00.802 --> 00:46:03.763
by that serial predator
leader of theirs.

1025
00:46:03.805 --> 00:46:05.056
Just stay with me tonight.

1026
00:46:05.765 --> 00:46:07.559
- I'll be okay. but thank you.

1027
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.937
I don't. you know. I. I don't
think he gonna come back here.

1028
00:46:10.979 --> 00:46:13.106
especially after he
found out I survived.

1029
00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:16.443
I just gotta find that proof
and press these charges.

1030
00:46:16.484 --> 00:46:20.321
- (sighs) Okay. but I will
be calling you later on

1031
00:46:20.363 --> 00:46:21.573
and in the morning.

1032
00:46:21.614 --> 00:46:24.409
- Okay. thank you. cuz.
thank you for coming in.

1033
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:25.326
being there for me.

1034
00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:28.747
- That is what family does.
(dramatic music continues)

1035
00:46:28.788 --> 00:46:30.623
Me and you are like sisters.

1036
00:46:30.665 --> 00:46:32.083
I'll just be glad when you get

1037
00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:35.295
outta this messed up marriage
and have yourself back.

1038
00:46:37.088 --> 00:46:39.924
- I filed. so that's
the first step.

1039
00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:43.762
- Mm. you shoulda asked for
a little bit more. you know.

1040
00:46:43.803 --> 00:46:45.889
like that new car.

1041
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.807
(laughs) But I'll
check on you later.

1042
00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:49.059
- Okay.

1043
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.810
Make sure you call me
when you get home. okay?

1044
00:46:50.852 --> 00:46:51.728
- All right. give me a hug.

1045
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.771
I love you.
- All right.

1046
00:46:52.812 --> 00:46:53.521
Love you. too.

1047
00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:55.315
Thank you again.

1048
00:46:55.357 --> 00:46:56.733
- [Starla] All right.

1049
00:46:56.775 --> 00:46:57.859
- What in the world?

1050
00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:01.654
(Mahogany sighs)

1051
00:47:01.696 --> 00:47:02.447
Hmm.

1052
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:03.907
(plate clanking)

1053
00:47:03.948 --> 00:47:05.033
- So. you believe he drugged
you with that bottle of wine?

1054
00:47:05.075 --> 00:47:07.077
- I know he did.
and he tried to act

1055
00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:09.621
like he was a changed man.

1056
00:47:09.662 --> 00:47:10.663
- Was you able to prove it?

1057
00:47:10.705 --> 00:47:11.915
- No.

1058
00:47:11.956 --> 00:47:13.833
I mean. if I had told
someone at the hospital.

1059
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.960
they woulda just
thought I was crazy.

1060
00:47:16.002 --> 00:47:17.671
- Hmm.
- Plus. he had the church

1061
00:47:17.712 --> 00:47:19.881
to back him up
like he did before.

1062
00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:21.925
- What you mean like before?

1063
00:47:21.966 --> 00:47:23.343
- Not like that. Ms. Celeste.

1064
00:47:23.385 --> 00:47:26.971
What I mean is I exposed
Minister Rasalas about the rape

1065
00:47:27.013 --> 00:47:31.434
to the church. and all
they did was make us marry.

1066
00:47:31.476 --> 00:47:32.143
(Mahogany scoffs)

1067
00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:33.311
They didn't believe me.

1068
00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:34.813
- So. you went to
the church members?

1069
00:47:34.854 --> 00:47:36.356
- I went to the church members.

1070
00:47:36.398 --> 00:47:38.733
and all they did was
call the police and say

1071
00:47:38.775 --> 00:47:40.527
that I threatened
them. and I was kicked

1072
00:47:40.568 --> 00:47:43.822
outta the. out of the church
and wasn't allowed back.

1073
00:47:43.863 --> 00:47:45.323
- What?

1074
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:46.866
So. I mean. I didn't even
know you could stop somebody

1075
00:47:46.908 --> 00:47:49.369
from going to God's
church and serving him.

1076
00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:50.870
That's crazy.

1077
00:47:50.912 --> 00:47:52.372
- Yeah. but that's because
this wasn't God's church.

1078
00:47:52.414 --> 00:47:53.581
This was theirs.

1079
00:47:53.623 --> 00:47:54.541
- You got that right.
- Mm-hmm.

1080
00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:55.583
- But you know what?

1081
00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:57.002
God is the judge.

1082
00:47:57.043 --> 00:47:59.212
So. what happened after that?

1083
00:47:59.254 --> 00:48:00.922
- Well. I got settled in bed.

1084
00:48:00.964 --> 00:48:02.882
I was still tired from
feeling those effects

1085
00:48:02.924 --> 00:48:05.051
from the. uh. the.
the drug or whatever.

1086
00:48:05.093 --> 00:48:06.803
and I was waiting
on my cousin Starla-

1087
00:48:06.845 --> 00:48:07.887
- Mm-hmm.
- to call me.

1088
00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:10.807
And I. I got tired
and went to sleep.

1089
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:12.392
- I can't even imagine.

1090
00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:15.353
Well. good thing is that it
didn't do any serious damage.

1091
00:48:15.395 --> 00:48:16.521
whatever it was.

1092
00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:19.315
So. were you able to
get any rest that night?

1093
00:48:19.357 --> 00:48:20.775
Did he come home?

1094
00:48:20.817 --> 00:48:23.278
- Well. after Starla called
me and I told her I was okay.

1095
00:48:24.446 --> 00:48:28.158
all I remember is being dragged
outta my bed by gunpoint.

1096
00:48:28.199 --> 00:48:30.410
talking about let's take a ride.

1097
00:48:30.452 --> 00:48:31.828
- Oh. my God.

1098
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.329
Was it Minister Rasalas?
- Yes.

1099
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.166
And at first I
thought I was having

1100
00:48:36.207 --> 00:48:37.876
a bad dream or something.

1101
00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:40.253
I didn't know if
this was it for me.

1102
00:48:40.295 --> 00:48:42.380
but. and he looked like
he was having some kind

1103
00:48:42.422 --> 00:48:45.842
of breakdown. and then I
realized I was being kidnapped

1104
00:48:45.884 --> 00:48:47.677
at 1:00 AM.
(dramatic music)

1105
00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:48.762
- Wow.

1106
00:48:48.803 --> 00:48:51.306
(footsteps plodding)

1107
00:48:51.348 --> 00:48:52.182
- Mahogany.

1108
00:48:54.809 --> 00:48:56.561
Mahogany. Mahogany.

1109
00:49:01.608 --> 00:49:04.527
(bag rustling)
(keys jangling)

1110
00:49:04.569 --> 00:49:07.739
Keys. purse.

1111
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:08.782
(Starla exhales)

1112
00:49:08.823 --> 00:49:09.574
Jesus.

1113
00:49:11.618 --> 00:49:12.410
Hello.

1114
00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:15.080
Mahogany. where are you?

1115
00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:17.832
I have been calling your
phone for several days.

1116
00:49:17.874 --> 00:49:20.460
You need to pick up your phone.

1117
00:49:20.502 --> 00:49:21.336
The door is unlocked.

1118
00:49:21.378 --> 00:49:23.463
Your purse is here on the table.

1119
00:49:23.505 --> 00:49:26.174
If you do not call me back.
I will call the police.

1120
00:49:27.509 --> 00:49:28.468
(phone clanking)

1121
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.054
(phone buzzing)

1122
00:49:33.848 --> 00:49:35.433
- [Mahogany] Starla. it's me.

1123
00:49:35.475 --> 00:49:38.144
- Where are you.
and what's going on?

1124
00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:40.313
- [Mahogany] Listen. I am fine.

1125
00:49:40.355 --> 00:49:42.899
I. I need you not to
call the police. okay?

1126
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:44.401
I'll be fine.

1127
00:49:44.442 --> 00:49:50.490
- Like I said. where are
you. and who are you with?

1128
00:49:50.532 --> 00:49:51.825
Mahogany. you don't
even sound right.

1129
00:49:51.866 --> 00:49:54.035
Send me the address right now.

1130
00:49:54.994 --> 00:49:57.497
- [Rasalas] Tell
her you're with me.

1131
00:49:57.539 --> 00:49:58.957
and we got back together.

1132
00:49:58.998 --> 00:50:01.292
We went away for a couple days.

1133
00:50:03.128 --> 00:50:04.879
- And who voice was that?

1134
00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:07.590
I know you not with that rapist.

1135
00:50:07.632 --> 00:50:08.967
Like. come on. Mahogany.

1136
00:50:09.009 --> 00:50:10.760
What is wrong with you?

1137
00:50:10.802 --> 00:50:12.554
You just divorced this dude.

1138
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:16.099
Send me the location right now.

1139
00:50:16.141 --> 00:50:17.726
(dramatic music continues)

1140
00:50:17.767 --> 00:50:19.019
- [Mahogany] I'll be okay. okay?

1141
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:19.936
I promise.

1142
00:50:19.978 --> 00:50:22.188
Uh. don't call the. no police.

1143
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.357
I will see you as
soon as I. I can.

1144
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:25.859
I'll call you when I get back.

1145
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.528
- Mm-mm. this don't
even feel right.

1146
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.573
Just let me come see for
myself. and then I will leave.

1147
00:50:32.907 --> 00:50:34.159
I'm coming to get you.

1148
00:50:34.993 --> 00:50:37.412
(phone beeps)

1149
00:50:37.454 --> 00:50:38.204
Hello?

1150
00:50:39.039 --> 00:50:40.206
Hello?

1151
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:42.042
(Starla exhales)

1152
00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:43.376
Ooh. I know something wrong now.

1153
00:50:43.418 --> 00:50:46.004
(finger tapping)

1154
00:50:46.046 --> 00:50:47.630
Hello.

1155
00:50:47.672 --> 00:50:51.676
Yes. I need someone at
557 Tenderlane Drive ASAP.

1156
00:50:51.718 --> 00:50:53.970
My cousin has been kidnapped.

1157
00:50:54.012 --> 00:50:55.805
(dramatic music)

1158
00:50:55.847 --> 00:50:57.599
(Rasalas exhaling)

1159
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.933
- Look what you made me do.

1160
00:50:58.975 --> 00:50:59.934
- Oh. my God.
- You got these people

1161
00:50:59.976 --> 00:51:01.561
out here thinking I'm crazy.

1162
00:51:01.603 --> 00:51:03.855
All you had to do
was be a good wife.

1163
00:51:03.897 --> 00:51:05.648
We would not be
in this position.

1164
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.358
(Mahogany whimpering)

1165
00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:07.984
- Boy. what do you mean?

1166
00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:10.570
That church got you messed up.

1167
00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:13.365
I mean. and the pastor
controls everything.

1168
00:51:13.406 --> 00:51:16.409
He even got you thinking
that raping me was okay.

1169
00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:17.827
- I told you.

1170
00:51:17.869 --> 00:51:21.790
God spoke to me and told me
you were my wife that night.

1171
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:23.375
I got a little anxious. okay?

1172
00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:25.543
But you will not
reject the call of God.

1173
00:51:25.585 --> 00:51:27.754
You will not shame
me in this way.

1174
00:51:27.796 --> 00:51:29.130
- Shame you how?

1175
00:51:29.172 --> 00:51:30.757
And this is not the call of God.

1176
00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:32.759
and I'm not your wife anymore.

1177
00:51:32.801 --> 00:51:35.970
- I guess I have to make
you realize that you are.

1178
00:51:36.012 --> 00:51:38.098
so take off your clothes now.

1179
00:51:38.139 --> 00:51:40.725
- No. I'm not gonna
take my clothes off.

1180
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:43.687
And if you're gonna do
something to me. just do it.

1181
00:51:43.728 --> 00:51:47.273
Like you all said. I was doomed
from the beginning. right?

1182
00:51:47.315 --> 00:51:50.819
So. you taking my life is
not gonna make me your wife.

1183
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:54.906
- Matthew 5:31-32. it said.

1184
00:51:54.948 --> 00:51:58.868
"If he who divorces his wife
makes her an adulteress."

1185
00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:03.665
and you gonna make
me sin against God?

1186
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:07.961
We are one. so if
you die. I die.

1187
00:52:08.003 --> 00:52:09.004
God hates divorces.

1188
00:52:09.045 --> 00:52:11.548
- Rasalas. you did
not divorce me.

1189
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:14.134
I filed against you.
(dramatic music continues)

1190
00:52:14.175 --> 00:52:16.678
So. whatever you going
to do to me. just do it.

1191
00:52:17.929 --> 00:52:20.140
This is not a marriage. Rasalas.

1192
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.183
and I am not your wife anymore.

1193
00:52:22.225 --> 00:52:24.519
And stop reading
quotes from the Bible

1194
00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:27.022
that you truly don't understand.

1195
00:52:27.063 --> 00:52:31.234
- Not until you admit
that you're my wife.

1196
00:52:31.276 --> 00:52:34.237
You forgive me from the past.

1197
00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:36.281
- Rasalas. I've
been forgave you.

1198
00:52:36.322 --> 00:52:38.992
but I'm not your wife anymore.

1199
00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:41.077
I don't love you in that way.

1200
00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.412
Why would you want
a wife that you have

1201
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:43.997
to force them to be with you?

1202
00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:47.500
- Then. have sex with
me one last time.

1203
00:52:47.542 --> 00:52:48.835
Those papers aren't signed yet.

1204
00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:52.047
You are still my wife.
and then I'll let you go.

1205
00:52:52.088 --> 00:52:53.423
- Me sleeping with you

1206
00:52:53.465 --> 00:52:55.800
one last time is not
gonna make me your wife.

1207
00:52:57.927 --> 00:53:00.388
- Genesis chapter 1. it says.

1208
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.432
"When a man goes inside a woman.

1209
00:53:02.474 --> 00:53:04.309
they are a husband and wife."

1210
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:08.396
And in a Matthew 19. it says.
"A woman is put to death

1211
00:53:08.438 --> 00:53:09.731
if she divorces you."

1212
00:53:11.232 --> 00:53:13.151
- You really are messed up when
it comes to the word of God

1213
00:53:13.193 --> 00:53:14.611
and what he's truly saying.

1214
00:53:14.652 --> 00:53:16.196
I don't believe
that God is saying

1215
00:53:16.237 --> 00:53:19.866
that a man can rape a
woman. or marry him. or die.

1216
00:53:19.908 --> 00:53:24.913
- All you had to do was be the
wife and not be the husband.

1217
00:53:24.954 --> 00:53:26.915
What's so hard about that. huh?

1218
00:53:27.874 --> 00:53:30.460
Was it. did you want
more money or something?

1219
00:53:30.502 --> 00:53:31.544
Or. was it that friend of yours

1220
00:53:31.586 --> 00:53:33.046
that got your head messed up?

1221
00:53:33.088 --> 00:53:35.382
- No. it's that church of
yours that got you messed up.

1222
00:53:35.423 --> 00:53:37.092
- So. what happened?

1223
00:53:37.133 --> 00:53:39.386
How did you get out
of this situation?

1224
00:53:39.427 --> 00:53:42.972
- Messed up as it is.
and I hate to admit this.

1225
00:53:44.265 --> 00:53:49.771
but I. I had to do what
I needed to do to survive

1226
00:53:49.813 --> 00:53:53.733
and to stay alive.
so I slept with him.

1227
00:53:53.775 --> 00:53:54.484
- Mm.

1228
00:53:55.777 --> 00:53:58.822
- And I promised him that
I would stay his wife.

1229
00:54:02.158 --> 00:54:04.327
you know. and as soon
as he fell asleep.

1230
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.122
I ran as fast as I could.

1231
00:54:07.163 --> 00:54:10.250
- So. did you call the police
on him so he can get arrested?

1232
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:13.086
I mean. 'cause that
was rape by force.

1233
00:54:13.128 --> 00:54:15.672
He tried to kill you
and. and kidnap you.

1234
00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:18.591
- To be honest. I was
still messed up in the head

1235
00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:21.678
from being programmed
and brainwashed.

1236
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.264
I mean. believing what the
Bible had told me about.

1237
00:54:24.305 --> 00:54:26.766
we do not take our brothers
and sisters to the law.

1238
00:54:26.808 --> 00:54:28.852
that we handle them
in our own way.

1239
00:54:28.893 --> 00:54:31.813
so that's what I wanted to
do was handle him my own way.

1240
00:54:31.855 --> 00:54:33.023
- You know what?

1241
00:54:33.064 --> 00:54:34.941
(clears throat) A lot of
people are brainwashed

1242
00:54:34.983 --> 00:54:38.862
by churches like this. like
cults. and when I look at you.

1243
00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:42.449
I mean. I can see the hurt
in your eyes just like me.

1244
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:46.453
And I remember looking for
help. and no one seemed to care.

1245
00:54:46.494 --> 00:54:48.204
(Mahogany exhales)

1246
00:54:48.246 --> 00:54:49.414
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

1247
00:54:49.456 --> 00:54:52.125
- So. you're saying
that you care about me?

1248
00:54:52.167 --> 00:54:53.126
I mean. really?

1249
00:54:53.168 --> 00:54:54.210
Why me?

1250
00:54:54.252 --> 00:54:55.712
You don't even know me.

1251
00:54:55.754 --> 00:54:58.089
You know. maybe this is just
another reason for you to write

1252
00:54:58.131 --> 00:55:02.010
down in your notepad like
you've been doing sitting there.

1253
00:55:02.052 --> 00:55:02.844
You know what? (laughs)

1254
00:55:02.886 --> 00:55:03.887
That's. I mean (laughs)-

1255
00:55:03.928 --> 00:55:06.139
- No. no. Mahogany.
that's not it.

1256
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:07.223
I do care.

1257
00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:08.475
(Mahogany scoffs)

1258
00:55:08.516 --> 00:55:10.769
Listen. I went to the
church for. for help.

1259
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:15.023
for my pain. seeking help.
and the bishop. I was raped

1260
00:55:15.065 --> 00:55:17.817
by the bishop. and
my grandmother. she
went to that church

1261
00:55:17.859 --> 00:55:22.989
for 25 years and had
me to keep that quiet.

1262
00:55:23.031 --> 00:55:25.158
I ended up having a son by him.

1263
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.243
- A son?
- Yes.

1264
00:55:27.285 --> 00:55:30.246
And couldn't say anything.
(dramatic music)

1265
00:55:30.288 --> 00:55:33.583
And when my son was
15. he found out.

1266
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:37.712
and he committed suicide.

1267
00:55:38.922 --> 00:55:42.342
- What. I mean. what does that
have to do with his death?

1268
00:55:42.384 --> 00:55:45.261
I mean. did. did he know
that that was his father?

1269
00:55:45.303 --> 00:55:46.846
If you don't mind me asking.

1270
00:55:46.888 --> 00:55:49.224
- No. I don't. I
don't mind sharing.

1271
00:55:49.265 --> 00:55:52.727
He. um. once he find
out how he was conceived

1272
00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:57.148
and who his father really
was. he was. he was depressed.

1273
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.316
- Wow.

1274
00:55:58.358 --> 00:56:00.068
I'm so sorry that
that happened to him.

1275
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.322
And how did you ever forgive
God for doing that to you?

1276
00:56:04.364 --> 00:56:05.865
(Celeste sighs)

1277
00:56:05.907 --> 00:56:08.702
- Look. the word of God wants
us to share our testimonies

1278
00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:12.205
with each other and for
us to be able to heal

1279
00:56:12.247 --> 00:56:14.290
and help others break the cycle.

1280
00:56:14.332 --> 00:56:16.167
- I'm so sorry that
you lost your son

1281
00:56:16.209 --> 00:56:17.544
and that you had
to go through that.

1282
00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:19.713
(dramatic music continues)

1283
00:56:19.754 --> 00:56:23.299
- Yeah. he was. um.
he was my only son.

1284
00:56:23.341 --> 00:56:25.844
- Yeah. wow.

1285
00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:26.886
- Yeah.

1286
00:56:26.928 --> 00:56:28.388
(paper rustling)

1287
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:32.767
But the word of God helped me
to understand. Jeremiah 29:11.

1288
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:37.272
"To prosper us. not to harm us."

1289
00:56:37.313 --> 00:56:38.565
- Mm.
- And for us

1290
00:56:38.606 --> 00:56:41.067
to not take the law
into our own hands.

1291
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:42.110
- Not being smart.

1292
00:56:43.528 --> 00:56:46.114
But what does this have to
do with the fact of every man

1293
00:56:46.156 --> 00:56:49.659
and every monster that has
ever done anything to us?

1294
00:56:49.701 --> 00:56:50.910
You know. what does this
have to do with them?

1295
00:56:50.952 --> 00:56:52.787
Don't they pay by
that law that you say?

1296
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:57.250
- Listen. I know how you
feel. and that's why I'm here

1297
00:56:57.292 --> 00:56:58.752
because I do believe your story.

1298
00:56:58.793 --> 00:57:01.588
And once others hear
it and read about it.

1299
00:57:01.629 --> 00:57:03.465
it will help others come clean.

1300
00:57:04.299 --> 00:57:06.926
So. listen. back to your story.

1301
00:57:06.968 --> 00:57:09.596
You. you said you. you
ran. and. and you waited.

1302
00:57:09.637 --> 00:57:10.638
I mean. what happened?

1303
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.931
What happened next?

1304
00:57:11.973 --> 00:57:15.393
- Well. the next
day. my cousin came

1305
00:57:15.435 --> 00:57:16.936
over to my house. Starla.

1306
00:57:16.978 --> 00:57:18.271
- [Celeste] Yeah.

1307
00:57:18.313 --> 00:57:20.940
- And she had came
with the police.

1308
00:57:20.982 --> 00:57:22.317
- Okay. great.

1309
00:57:22.359 --> 00:57:24.110
I mean. was you able to tell
'em what happened to you?

1310
00:57:24.152 --> 00:57:24.944
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

1311
00:57:24.986 --> 00:57:26.154
- No.

1312
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:28.490
You know. because I was.
I was still messed up

1313
00:57:28.531 --> 00:57:31.242
and brainwashed from
what I was being taught.

1314
00:57:31.284 --> 00:57:32.202
But you know what?

1315
00:57:33.244 --> 00:57:35.955
I wanted to expose them myself.

1316
00:57:35.997 --> 00:57:37.624
So. I took the law
into my own hands.

1317
00:57:37.665 --> 00:57:38.458
- [Officer Candace] Now.
have you heard anything

1318
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.668
at all from her?

1319
00:57:39.709 --> 00:57:41.169
- [Starla] I haven't
heard anything.

1320
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:42.337
- [Officer Candace] Looks
like she just walked in.

1321
00:57:42.379 --> 00:57:43.630
(door clattering)

1322
00:57:43.672 --> 00:57:44.547
- [Mahogany] Starla.

1323
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:45.548
- Mahogany.
- Hey.

1324
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:46.549
- Where have you been?

1325
00:57:46.591 --> 00:57:47.384
(Mahogany clears throat)

1326
00:57:47.425 --> 00:57:48.635
And are you okay?

1327
00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:51.262
- I'm okay. and why are
the police at my home?

1328
00:57:51.304 --> 00:57:54.391
- I've been calling your phone
all night and this morning.

1329
00:57:54.432 --> 00:57:55.392
- [Mahogany] Okay.

1330
00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:57.394
- Hello. I'm Officer Candace.

1331
00:57:57.435 --> 00:57:58.687
Are you okay. Ms. Noble?

1332
00:57:58.728 --> 00:58:00.814
Now. tell me. were
you kidnapped?

1333
00:58:00.855 --> 00:58:04.484
- No. I. I'm fine as you can
see. um. and if you don't mind.

1334
00:58:04.526 --> 00:58:06.027
you can leave.

1335
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.861
- I know.

1336
00:58:06.903 --> 00:58:08.488
- What are you talking about?

1337
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.281
You are not okay. Mahogany.

1338
00:58:10.323 --> 00:58:11.908
(paper rustling)

1339
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:13.368
That punk kidnapped
you yesterday. and
when we were talking

1340
00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:15.537
on the phone. you hung up on me.

1341
00:58:16.538 --> 00:58:18.331
- Is this true. Ms. Noble?

1342
00:58:18.373 --> 00:58:20.333
Are you in any type of trouble?

1343
00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:22.377
And again. were you kidnapped?

1344
00:58:22.419 --> 00:58:24.796
- No. like I said.
officer. I am fine.

1345
00:58:24.838 --> 00:58:27.841
My cousin called me.
and she's overreacting

1346
00:58:27.882 --> 00:58:30.510
because I couldn't
talk when she called.

1347
00:58:30.552 --> 00:58:32.345
- I overreacted?

1348
00:58:32.387 --> 00:58:33.430
Are you serious?

1349
00:58:33.471 --> 00:58:34.347
- [Mahogany] Mm-hmm.

1350
00:58:34.389 --> 00:58:36.266
- This man has drugged you.

1351
00:58:36.307 --> 00:58:38.518
He stalked you for
several months.

1352
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.687
He was hiding in your
backyard at night.

1353
00:58:41.688 --> 00:58:44.357
and he was threatening
to divorce you as well.

1354
00:58:44.399 --> 00:58:45.483
And we not even gonna talk

1355
00:58:45.525 --> 00:58:48.278
about that wacky
church he belongs to.

1356
00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:49.571
- Is this true. Ms. Noble?

1357
00:58:49.612 --> 00:58:51.865
Are you afraid of your husband?

1358
00:58:51.906 --> 00:58:53.533
Now. do you want me
to file a report?

1359
00:58:53.575 --> 00:58:55.452
Because it seems
necessary at this point.

1360
00:58:55.493 --> 00:58:56.661
- [Mahogany] Are you serious.

1361
00:58:56.703 --> 00:58:58.079
officer. right now?
- Very serious.

1362
00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:00.415
- Like I said. I am fine.

1363
00:59:00.457 --> 00:59:02.042
My cousin here overreacted.

1364
00:59:02.083 --> 00:59:04.669
She's just upset because
I decided to work things

1365
00:59:04.711 --> 00:59:07.672
out with my husband after
I filed for a divorce.

1366
00:59:07.714 --> 00:59:09.049
- [Starla] Hmm.

1367
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.842
- Now. if you
don't mind leaving.

1368
00:59:10.884 --> 00:59:12.635
I would like to
take a long bath.

1369
00:59:16.264 --> 00:59:19.309
And for the record. you
should be asking my husband

1370
00:59:19.351 --> 00:59:20.477
if he's scared of me.

1371
00:59:20.518 --> 00:59:22.020
- Is your husband okay?

1372
00:59:22.062 --> 00:59:23.229
Is there a reason

1373
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:25.357
why I should be asking
your husband is he okay?

1374
00:59:25.398 --> 00:59:26.191
- I'm sorry.

1375
00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:27.359
He is fine.

1376
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.526
He's just. it was
just a joke. (laughs)

1377
00:59:28.568 --> 00:59:29.527
- Okay.

1378
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:30.820
- Um. he's good.

1379
00:59:31.988 --> 00:59:33.615
You know I left him feeling
real good. you know.

1380
00:59:33.656 --> 00:59:35.658
performing the last
wifely duties a woman got

1381
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.701
to do in the bedroom.

1382
00:59:36.743 --> 00:59:38.370
So. he is knocked out.

1383
00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:40.914
- Are you crazy?

1384
00:59:40.955 --> 00:59:42.582
- Mm-hmm. no.
- Something is not right.

1385
00:59:42.624 --> 00:59:43.416
(Mahogany clears throat)

1386
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:44.459
- Did he drug you again?

1387
00:59:44.501 --> 00:59:45.919
- Drug. what?
- What?

1388
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.296
- Because I know you did
not go sleep with that scum.

1389
00:59:48.338 --> 00:59:49.589
- Oh. my goodness.

1390
00:59:49.631 --> 00:59:50.590
- What is really going
on here. drugged you?

1391
00:59:50.632 --> 00:59:52.509
What is Ms. James talking about?

1392
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:53.760
- Tell her.

1393
00:59:53.802 --> 00:59:55.136
- Officer. are you serious

1394
00:59:55.178 --> 00:59:56.304
right now?
- Very serious.

1395
00:59:56.346 --> 00:59:57.931
- Look. it's. my cousin
Starla's just upset.

1396
00:59:57.972 --> 01:00:00.642
She's a drama queen because
I. again. like I said.

1397
01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.602
I decided to work things
out with my husband.

1398
01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:04.604
You should understand that.

1399
01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:08.566
- No. I just thank
you crazy and on drugs

1400
01:00:08.608 --> 01:00:09.984
if you went and did that.

1401
01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:12.821
(paper rustling)

1402
01:00:12.862 --> 01:00:15.115
- Well. if you change
your mind. Ms. Noble.

1403
01:00:15.156 --> 01:00:16.449
because you're telling
me that you're okay

1404
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.576
and that there's
absolutely nothing wrong-

1405
01:00:18.618 --> 01:00:19.828
- Right.

1406
01:00:19.869 --> 01:00:23.289
- I mean. I'll just make
this a closed case then.

1407
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:24.207
- Case?

1408
01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:25.458
Who said this was a case?

1409
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.711
- I did. and the
case just reopened

1410
01:00:27.752 --> 01:00:30.588
because I don't know what
that man has done nor said

1411
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.590
to you for you to be
sitting in here acting

1412
01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:34.342
like nothing is wrong. Mahogany.

1413
01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:37.721
- Mm. mm. mm. mm.
- Well.

1414
01:00:39.055 --> 01:00:41.641
if there's nothing wrong.
ladies. I'll be going now.

1415
01:00:41.683 --> 01:00:43.143
- Okay.
(paper rustling)

1416
01:00:43.184 --> 01:00:45.478
- But I will leave you
with my card. Mrs. Noble.

1417
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.981
Please. utilize this
card at any time.

1418
01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:51.401
(card clattering)

1419
01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:54.988
- I will. and I'll be getting
to the bottom of this.

1420
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.072
Thank you.

1421
01:00:56.114 --> 01:00:57.115
- You're welcome.
- Have a good day.

1422
01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:57.866
- Good day. ladies.

1423
01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.367
- Bye. officer. thank you.

1424
01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:04.205
- Okay. now tell me what
the heck is going on.

1425
01:01:05.623 --> 01:01:06.958
And where are your
shoes. Mahogany?

1426
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.544
- Calm down first.
Starla. and I'll tell you.

1427
01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:10.628
Look. I'm good.

1428
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:12.756
I don't need the
police involved.

1429
01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:15.342
I wanna handle him myself. okay?

1430
01:01:15.383 --> 01:01:17.177
Plus. you know that they're
not gonna believe me.

1431
01:01:17.218 --> 01:01:18.636
They're gonna
believe him over me.

1432
01:01:18.678 --> 01:01:22.140
especially with that new
good pastor on his side.

1433
01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:22.766
God.
(dramatic music)

1434
01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:23.975
I got a plan.

1435
01:01:24.017 --> 01:01:26.269
- Okay. then. 'cause
you already know

1436
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:28.313
I'm that ride-or-die sister.

1437
01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:29.773
so tell me what happened.

1438
01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:31.608
and what's the plan?
(dramatic music)

1439
01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:32.734
- Okay.

1440
01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:34.527
So. how does it feel

1441
01:01:34.569 --> 01:01:36.321
when the tables are
turned. minister?

1442
01:01:37.655 --> 01:01:38.531
- What are you doing?

1443
01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:39.699
Are you crazy?

1444
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:40.408
You're not gonna
get away with this.

1445
01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:41.534
- Oh. really?

1446
01:01:41.576 --> 01:01:43.161
I'm. am I crazy?

1447
01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:44.871
You should be asking
yourself that.

1448
01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:47.499
I mean. after you
had me captured

1449
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.794
in that five-year long.
disgusting marriage with you.

1450
01:01:50.835 --> 01:01:51.628
So. tell me.

1451
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:53.338
How does it feel?

1452
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.131
- Cut me loose now.

1453
01:01:55.173 --> 01:01:57.592
Are you that stupid like
my pastor said you were?

1454
01:01:57.634 --> 01:01:58.551
(Mahogany laughs)

1455
01:01:58.593 --> 01:02:01.513
- Yeah. I believe I am stupid.

1456
01:02:02.972 --> 01:02:04.224
- They're gonna
come looking for me.

1457
01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:07.435
- Who. that fake. greedy
pastor of yours. baby?

1458
01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:08.687
No. no. no. no.

1459
01:02:08.728 --> 01:02:11.231
See. today was your
payday. and so I made sure

1460
01:02:11.272 --> 01:02:14.567
to leave a nice
donation in the basket

1461
01:02:14.609 --> 01:02:17.404
along with a note saying that
we decided to work things out.

1462
01:02:17.445 --> 01:02:21.741
and we were gonna take a
long trip to make things up.

1463
01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:22.617
(Mahogany laughs)

1464
01:02:22.659 --> 01:02:23.993
- You're sick.
- Sick.

1465
01:02:24.035 --> 01:02:26.413
- He'll never believe that
I'll miss church on Sunday.

1466
01:02:26.454 --> 01:02:30.458
- Uh. yes. he will because.
see. I was taught by the best

1467
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.670
that money can buy anything
that you need to disappear.

1468
01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:35.255
Oh. how do you feel?

1469
01:02:35.296 --> 01:02:37.632
I hope Starla didn't
drug you too much.

1470
01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:39.092
- What do you mean
Starla drugged me?

1471
01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:41.386
I never seen her or
drank anything she had.

1472
01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:42.554
- Yes. you did. baby.

1473
01:02:42.595 --> 01:02:43.930
Oh. yeah. I forgot
you don't like Starla.

1474
01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:45.515
So. we had Aquilla Shine.

1475
01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:48.768
you know. the one you were
supposed to marry besides me.

1476
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:49.769
to give it to you.

1477
01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.980
So. who is the stupid one now?

1478
01:02:52.022 --> 01:02:55.650
I asked you. how does
it feel. Rasalas?

1479
01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:57.152
- Nah. you're a liar.

1480
01:02:57.193 --> 01:02:58.862
Sister Aquilla would
never be like you

1481
01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:01.281
and that harlot friend of yours.

1482
01:03:01.322 --> 01:03:04.826
She's a real wholesome woman
that God chose to be my wife.

1483
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.411
- [Mahogany] Really?

1484
01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:10.623
- Now. listen. let me go. and
I will not bother you again.

1485
01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:11.916
- Bother me again?

1486
01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:12.959
(Mahogany laughs)

1487
01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:14.919
Now. why should I do that?

1488
01:03:15.712 --> 01:03:17.005
Don't you want me anymore?

1489
01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.841
What. you don't want my body?

1490
01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:21.384
I thought you did.

1491
01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:24.304
I mean. you did tell me that
by drugging me by gunpoint.

1492
01:03:24.346 --> 01:03:26.389
it. that anytime that I
would have sex with you.

1493
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:27.724
let me think about it.

1494
01:03:27.766 --> 01:03:30.560
you would. you would just
make me feel sick. right?

1495
01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:31.978
And I figured maybe this is

1496
01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.814
what men want. you
know. is to take it.

1497
01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:36.191
So. I'm gonna take it.

1498
01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:39.611
- Look. I'm sorry. okay?

1499
01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:40.779
I moved on.
(Mahogany laughs)

1500
01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.030
- You moved on?

1501
01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:43.782
Oh. you said that a few times

1502
01:03:43.823 --> 01:03:45.367
when you used the
bathroom on me.

1503
01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:46.785
- Used the bathroom?
(dramatic music)

1504
01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:47.702
What. what are
you talking about?

1505
01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:48.870
Now. you're just
making up stuff.

1506
01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.663
- Oh. no. I'm not.
with that little worm

1507
01:03:50.705 --> 01:03:52.415
that you call a
God-given pleasure.

1508
01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:55.460
Please.

1509
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.838
- Listen.

1510
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.674
- Listen. hmm?

1511
01:04:00.715 --> 01:04:02.842
- I said I was sorry.

1512
01:04:02.884 --> 01:04:03.885
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- I moved on.

1513
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:05.929
- You sorry?
- I will never bother

1514
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:06.805
you again.

1515
01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:07.847
I'm gonna get remarried soon.

1516
01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:10.934
- You. to who. Sister Aquilla?

1517
01:04:10.975 --> 01:04:11.976
Oh. that's what you thought.

1518
01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:13.687
(laughing) Now. that's a laugh.

1519
01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:15.605
No. baby. I think you want me.

1520
01:04:16.815 --> 01:04:18.942
- Listen. baby. I know
you've been messed up

1521
01:04:18.983 --> 01:04:21.861
by many other people.
and I did not go

1522
01:04:21.903 --> 01:04:23.321
about things the right way.

1523
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:24.030
- Oh.

1524
01:04:24.072 --> 01:04:24.781
- But we can be friends.

1525
01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:25.865
- Friends?

1526
01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:27.033
- What do you need?

1527
01:04:27.075 --> 01:04:29.536
- Admit that you
drugged and raped me.

1528
01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:32.789
or I'm gonna start cutting
this thing off piece by piece.

1529
01:04:32.831 --> 01:04:34.624
starting with your
freaking nuts.

1530
01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.835
- Mahogany. baby. listen. okay?

1531
01:04:36.876 --> 01:04:38.878
I will pay your rent for
you as long as I need to.

1532
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.171
- I pay my rent.

1533
01:04:40.213 --> 01:04:42.048
- I'll even buy you
a car if I need to.

1534
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.717
(sighs) Look. I'll even
give you the $1.000

1535
01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:45.468
I give to the church every week.

1536
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:46.636
- Wait a minute.

1537
01:04:46.678 --> 01:04:48.054
You give the church
$1.000 a week

1538
01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:50.682
while we gotta live in
a low-income apartment?

1539
01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:51.975
Really?

1540
01:04:52.017 --> 01:04:54.561
No wonder he drives a new
truck and has a new suit

1541
01:04:54.602 --> 01:04:57.981
on every Sunday while you still
got the same two tired suits

1542
01:04:58.023 --> 01:04:59.816
that you've been wearing
for the last seven years.

1543
01:04:59.858 --> 01:05:01.860
Who is the stupid one?

1544
01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:02.819
(dramatic music continues)

1545
01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:04.070
- Listen.

1546
01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:05.655
- (laughs) Listen.
- Let me loose.

1547
01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:06.573
and we can talk.

1548
01:05:06.614 --> 01:05:07.824
- [Mahogany] Boy.

1549
01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:09.909
- I never knew that
I hurt you that much.

1550
01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:11.244
You're right.

1551
01:05:11.286 --> 01:05:13.371
I do need to find another
church so I can understand

1552
01:05:13.413 --> 01:05:14.789
what God is really
trying to say.

1553
01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:17.584
- (laughs) What do
you think. I'm stupid?

1554
01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:20.378
What I want for you to
do. Rasalas. is admit

1555
01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.839
that you drugged and raped
me. and that you kidnapped me

1556
01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:25.425
at gunpoint. and that
the whole church turned

1557
01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:28.094
a deaf ear and a blind eye
to what's going on in there.

1558
01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:30.138
Babe. babe. babe. baby.
- Baby?

1559
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.806
- Look. look. look.
look. look. listen.

1560
01:05:31.848 --> 01:05:32.849
listen.
- Yeah. what?

1561
01:05:32.891 --> 01:05:33.641
- You got it all wrong.

1562
01:05:33.683 --> 01:05:34.893
- Got it wrong?
- Okay?

1563
01:05:34.934 --> 01:05:37.687
Everything I say to you
is from the Bible. 'kay?

1564
01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:39.230
You got it all wrong.

1565
01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:41.149
You've been hanging with
those worldly friends

1566
01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:44.944
of yours again. and that
Starla. she has a lot of spirits

1567
01:05:44.986 --> 01:05:47.614
in her. and I think they
jumped into you. too.

1568
01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:50.617
And I can cast it out of
you if you just let me go.

1569
01:05:50.658 --> 01:05:52.660
- You are a joke.

1570
01:05:52.702 --> 01:05:55.872
Something must be really wrong
with that brain of yours.

1571
01:05:55.914 --> 01:05:58.291
but maybe we should just
do a repeat of events

1572
01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.877
of what you did on me. hmm?

1573
01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:01.878
- Wait. we?

1574
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.962
What do-
- I wouldn't mind that.

1575
01:06:03.004 --> 01:06:03.797
- [Rasalas] What do you mean we?

1576
01:06:03.838 --> 01:06:04.964
Who's here with you?

1577
01:06:05.006 --> 01:06:06.091
- Me. (laughing)
who's here with me?

1578
01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:08.468
Me and the spirits
you claim are in me.

1579
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.554
- So. you want to
drug and rape me?

1580
01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:13.014
- Don't flatter yourself.

1581
01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:16.184
I would never upset myself
with this half a pint

1582
01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:18.937
that you call a
God-given pleasure.

1583
01:06:18.978 --> 01:06:20.939
As a matter of fact. I
probably should have asked

1584
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.399
for pain and suffering

1585
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.819
for this no-good. actually.
ugh. disgusting member.

1586
01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.362
And instead of using
this big knife.

1587
01:06:27.404 --> 01:06:30.490
I shoulda got my paring knife
because that's more your size.

1588
01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:32.909
- Okay. okay. I admit it.

1589
01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:34.661
I took advantage of
you some years ago.

1590
01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:36.705
- You admit it.

1591
01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:39.708
And?
- And.

1592
01:06:39.749 --> 01:06:41.751
(sighs) And.

1593
01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:42.544
- And?

1594
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.047
- I know you said
stop several times.

1595
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.677
and I. and I knew
you didn't drink.

1596
01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:54.472
so I put a little something
in your wine to relax you.

1597
01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:56.683
And I really messed
up by having sex

1598
01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:57.851
without your permission.

1599
01:06:57.892 --> 01:06:59.185
- And you raped me.

1600
01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:02.022
and you. and the pastor
agreed it was okay. right?

1601
01:07:02.063 --> 01:07:03.023
- Yes.
- God.

1602
01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:05.108
- Pastor Sims knows about it.

1603
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:06.860
I admitted it to him.

1604
01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:08.695
He thought it would
be a good idea

1605
01:07:08.737 --> 01:07:09.988
if we didn't get
the law involved

1606
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:14.075
and that I would just
marry you to make it right.

1607
01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:17.162
I was up to being minister.
and I needed a wife

1608
01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:19.122
before I got the title.

1609
01:07:19.164 --> 01:07:22.208
- So. you admit
that you raped me

1610
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.046
over. and over. and
over again. right?

1611
01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:28.006
And the pastor agreed.

1612
01:07:28.048 --> 01:07:29.549
- Yes. you got your confession.

1613
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:30.300
Now. let me go.

1614
01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:31.384
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

1615
01:07:31.426 --> 01:07:32.969
See. just a few more confessions

1616
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:36.848
between you. me. and God. okay?

1617
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.475
That night that we had dinner.

1618
01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:41.186
admit to me that you
drugged and raped me

1619
01:07:41.227 --> 01:07:44.147
with some street drug.
and you dragged me

1620
01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:47.901
outta here. Rasalas. to a
hotel to have sex with you.

1621
01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:49.819
- Yes. I did it.

1622
01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:53.823
I went to my cousin's to get
something from the projects.

1623
01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:55.408
some type of street drug.

1624
01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.913
And I did kidnap you and
hold you at gunpoint.

1625
01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:02.248
But that was to
keep my marriage.

1626
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.708
But God spoke to me-

1627
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:04.626
- What-
- and said

1628
01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.127
that Aquilla was my wife.

1629
01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.962
That's why I left you alone.

1630
01:08:08.004 --> 01:08:10.090
(dramatic music continues)

1631
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:11.174
(Mahogany laughs)

1632
01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:12.217
- Good one.

1633
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.762
- (sighs) You mean to
tell me all this time

1634
01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:18.139
you had us thinking that
Sister Mahogany was crazy

1635
01:08:18.181 --> 01:08:20.934
and a liar. (laughing) that
she was sent from the devil

1636
01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:23.186
to destroy all of God's men?

1637
01:08:23.228 --> 01:08:26.898
And all of this time you and
pastor knew the whole time?

1638
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.108
Really. Minister Rasalas?

1639
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:30.276
- Sister Aquilla.
- Yeah.

1640
01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.779
- This is a setup. okay?

1641
01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:34.239
She's jealous.

1642
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.034
She's mad because I told her
I should marry you and not her

1643
01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:41.121
'cause she's a
scarlet. a Jezebel.

1644
01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:43.164
Look. call the police now.

1645
01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:45.458
Her and her friend
drugged and kidnapped me.

1646
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.127
- Like you did her
several years ago?

1647
01:08:47.168 --> 01:08:48.294
- [Mahogany] Yeah.

1648
01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:49.129
- And not to forget
that street drug

1649
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.338
they found in her system

1650
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.882
when she was about
to leave your butt.

1651
01:08:52.924 --> 01:08:54.551
- Stop with the lies. devil.

1652
01:08:54.592 --> 01:08:58.096
I heard everything.
and you will pay.

1653
01:08:58.138 --> 01:09:00.098
You are sick.

1654
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.141
I would have never married you.

1655
01:09:01.182 --> 01:09:03.643
You were never my type.

1656
01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:05.103
- You are all harlots.

1657
01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:06.479
- What?
- You are going to hell.

1658
01:09:06.521 --> 01:09:07.981
(Mahogany laughing)
- Mahogany. gimme that knife-

1659
01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:09.315
- No. Starla.
- so I can cut this off

1660
01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:11.317
so he'll never be
able to use it again.

1661
01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.902
- No. don't worry.

1662
01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:16.239
He will not be able to use
that to hurt anyone else again.

1663
01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:17.824
And he will not
be telling anybody

1664
01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:19.784
what has happened here today.

1665
01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:22.370
not after I allow the
bishop hear this confession.

1666
01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:24.205
Him and Pastor Sims
will never preach

1667
01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:25.999
at anyone's church again.

1668
01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:27.667
- Let me talk.

1669
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:29.002
I can pay you all.

1670
01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:30.337
- Pay. really?
(dramatic music continues)

1671
01:09:30.378 --> 01:09:32.380
Do you think that money can
buy everything. Rasalas.

1672
01:09:32.422 --> 01:09:34.966
all the pain I've been through.
the lies I've been told.

1673
01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:37.344
the separation of
me and my family?

1674
01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.179
- (laughs) No. but
me castrating it

1675
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.597
off can start the healing.

1676
01:09:40.638 --> 01:09:41.306
- Mm-hmm.

1677
01:09:41.348 --> 01:09:42.766
- Let me cut him.

1678
01:09:42.807 --> 01:09:43.850
- Wait a minute. no.

1679
01:09:43.892 --> 01:09:45.477
Like Sister Aquilla says.

1680
01:09:45.518 --> 01:09:49.522
'cause once bishop
hears this confession.

1681
01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:53.276
Pastor Sims and Rasalas.
they will have a lotta hell

1682
01:09:53.318 --> 01:09:56.112
to pay. and that's
payment enough.

1683
01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:58.073
So. I'm gonna untie him.

1684
01:09:58.114 --> 01:10:02.077
(dramatic music continues)

1685
01:10:02.118 --> 01:10:05.747
- So. so what happened
after you released him?

1686
01:10:05.789 --> 01:10:07.207
Did he go to the police?

1687
01:10:07.248 --> 01:10:09.918
I mean. did the confession
go to the bishop?

1688
01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:12.587
I mean. how did you resolve
your problem with him?

1689
01:10:12.629 --> 01:10:16.174
- To answer all those
questions. yes. I released him.

1690
01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:17.759
but. and he was begging us not

1691
01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:20.095
to. you know. say
anything 'cause he wanted

1692
01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:23.807
to save his pastorship
and his career.

1693
01:10:23.848 --> 01:10:26.226
But it was time for
him and Pastor Sims

1694
01:10:26.267 --> 01:10:28.728
to just face their
consequences. you know?

1695
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.233
And. uh. after some
years. I had found out

1696
01:10:33.274 --> 01:10:37.112
that he had remarried and
started his own church.

1697
01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:39.114
- Oh. wow. really?

1698
01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:40.573
- Mm-hmm.

1699
01:10:40.615 --> 01:10:43.201
- So. I mean. how did that
make you feel after he hurt you

1700
01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:46.538
like he did. and he
went and got remarried

1701
01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:48.123
and started another church?

1702
01:10:48.164 --> 01:10:49.958
- To be honest. I
was angry with God.

1703
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.420
I mean. how could you allow
this man to use your word

1704
01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:56.131
to falsely just abuse people?

1705
01:10:56.172 --> 01:10:58.466
He was damaging
souls. Ms. White.

1706
01:11:00.135 --> 01:11:01.428
God.

1707
01:11:01.469 --> 01:11:03.013
And then I felt bad for
the woman that he was with.

1708
01:11:03.054 --> 01:11:05.265
thinking maybe she went
through the same thing I did.

1709
01:11:05.306 --> 01:11:06.391
(gentle music)

1710
01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:08.018
- So. okay. so he
left the church.

1711
01:11:08.059 --> 01:11:09.644
What. what happened
to the pastor?

1712
01:11:10.895 --> 01:11:12.439
- Well. the pastor was
still running his church.

1713
01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.942
and. um. he wasn't.

1714
01:11:15.984 --> 01:11:18.611
you know. too full nowadays

1715
01:11:18.653 --> 01:11:20.113
because he had
lost some members-

1716
01:11:20.155 --> 01:11:22.657
- Mm-hmm.
- when the truth was told.

1717
01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:25.702
But some people stayed
under that false leadership.

1718
01:11:25.744 --> 01:11:27.746
- Yeah. you know. I did
some research on that.

1719
01:11:27.787 --> 01:11:31.249
like cults and things like
that. and a lotta people.

1720
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.376
they get really comfortable.
and it's hard for them

1721
01:11:33.418 --> 01:11:34.878
to leave after a while.

1722
01:11:35.837 --> 01:11:38.840
- Yeah. well. I
felt like a failure.

1723
01:11:41.092 --> 01:11:43.970
You know. no matter what I did.

1724
01:11:44.012 --> 01:11:46.181
it seemed like it just
wasn't good enough. you know.

1725
01:11:46.222 --> 01:11:48.433
I. I just couldn't
be proud of myself

1726
01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:50.685
even with raising my children.

1727
01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:53.438
I just felt like a
void was missing.

1728
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.191
- Listen. you are not
a failure. Mahogany.

1729
01:11:56.232 --> 01:11:57.859
and I don't wanna
hear you say that

1730
01:11:57.901 --> 01:12:00.320
because. yes. you've
been through a lot.

1731
01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:02.322
but there are people who
have done the same thing.

1732
01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:04.532
but they've committed suicide.

1733
01:12:04.574 --> 01:12:06.242
They're drinking alcohol.

1734
01:12:06.284 --> 01:12:07.452
They're taking drugs.

1735
01:12:07.494 --> 01:12:11.498
Listen. your story is
gonna free so many.

1736
01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:14.167
- Well. my alcohol and
my drug was the pain

1737
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:16.086
that I endured from the men.

1738
01:12:16.127 --> 01:12:16.920
That's all I knew.

1739
01:12:18.463 --> 01:12:21.383
- So. what did
you do after that?

1740
01:12:23.134 --> 01:12:26.513
- Well. I became celibate.

1741
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.517
and I started an
outreach ministry.

1742
01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.936
You know. I wanted
to help people

1743
01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:38.942
like children. and. uh. homeless
people. and women like me

1744
01:12:38.983 --> 01:12:40.151
that had been through
the same thing.

1745
01:12:41.569 --> 01:12:43.863
- [Celeste] So. did you get
in another relationship?

1746
01:12:43.905 --> 01:12:44.572
(gentle music continues)

1747
01:12:44.614 --> 01:12:45.532
- Yes. after 12 years.

1748
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.076
- So. is this the
marriage that led you

1749
01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:50.245
to the agency about a month ago?

1750
01:12:50.286 --> 01:12:51.871
- Yes. that's the one.

1751
01:12:51.913 --> 01:12:54.749
When I came to your
agency that day.

1752
01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:58.795
I wanted to kill him for
taking my life for 12 years.

1753
01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:01.339
- Um. okay. so can
you elaborate on that?

1754
01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:02.549
I mean. I got here in my notes

1755
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.592
that someone was in danger.

1756
01:13:04.634 --> 01:13:06.302
and it was a matter
of life or death.

1757
01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:08.388
- Yeah. I guess it
was life or death

1758
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.598
because I wanted to
kill him that day.

1759
01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:14.144
- Okay. so what was so
different about this marriage

1760
01:13:14.185 --> 01:13:17.480
that make you wanna get in
that mindset to kill someone?

1761
01:13:17.522 --> 01:13:19.733
- Where do you want me to start?

1762
01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:23.153
Because this marriage
was so different.

1763
01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:24.404
You know. I really wanted

1764
01:13:24.446 --> 01:13:30.118
to kill him or kill
myself. (laughs)

1765
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.327
- Um.

1766
01:13:31.369 --> 01:13:32.245
(Mahogany laughing)

1767
01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:33.038
- Ooh.
- Mahogany.

1768
01:13:33.079 --> 01:13:33.747
do we need to stop?

1769
01:13:33.788 --> 01:13:34.622
Do you need a moment?

1770
01:13:34.664 --> 01:13:36.124
- (laughing) No. I'm fine.

1771
01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.751
I want to get all of this
out while I can. Ms. White.

1772
01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:38.418
- Okay.

1773
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.586
- You know.

1774
01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:42.547
It's been a while
since I've thought

1775
01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:45.258
about killing someone
in that type of way.

1776
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.260
I mean. murdering
a man like that.

1777
01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:48.720
The last time I
remember doing that was

1778
01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:50.180
when my brother got killed.

1779
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:51.848
and I wanted to
kill his murderer.

1780
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:54.601
You know. he. he just
made me go to a place.

1781
01:13:54.642 --> 01:13:56.478
to a person I hated-

1782
01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:57.437
- Well-
- to become.

1783
01:13:57.479 --> 01:13:59.397
- Well. well who did you become?

1784
01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:05.236
- I became suicidal.
low self-esteem again.

1785
01:14:05.278 --> 01:14:06.488
You know. it was just

1786
01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:09.240
like that damaged goods
thing was just lingering

1787
01:14:09.282 --> 01:14:11.159
over my head like everyone said.

1788
01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:15.497
I was becoming what my
mother wanted me to be.

1789
01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.207
that little girl.

1790
01:14:17.248 --> 01:14:18.291
- Hmm.

1791
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:19.751
Okay. so tell me about that.

1792
01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:21.503
Talk. let's talk
about the relationship

1793
01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:22.629
with you and your mother.

1794
01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:24.964
- I never had one. Ms. White.

1795
01:14:25.006 --> 01:14:27.258
And when I tried. it
still was unstable.

1796
01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:31.471
- Okay. well. do you
wanna talk about it?

1797
01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:32.806
(Mahogany scoffs)

1798
01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:36.351
- Even though I was going
through in my own marriage

1799
01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:37.852
and having hardships-

1800
01:14:37.894 --> 01:14:39.479
- Mm-hmm.

1801
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:41.523
- I still rearranged
my life for her.

1802
01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:44.484
- Okay. so what happened
to make you have

1803
01:14:44.526 --> 01:14:47.320
to rearrange your
life for your mom?

1804
01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:49.322
- Well. she had
became critically ill.

1805
01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:50.573
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

1806
01:14:50.615 --> 01:14:51.741
- And I had to go out
of town. and get her.

1807
01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:54.452
and bring her back
to my home with me.

1808
01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:55.787
- Okay.

1809
01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:58.873
- And this was the worst
thing that I could have did

1810
01:14:58.915 --> 01:15:00.834
because I still
had to experience.

1811
01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:04.004
like. rejection. neglect-
(hands smacking)

1812
01:15:04.045 --> 01:15:04.879
- [Celeste] Wow.

1813
01:15:04.921 --> 01:15:06.756
- and. and abuse. mental abuse-

1814
01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:08.425
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

1815
01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:09.551
- from her.

1816
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:11.302
- Wow.

1817
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:17.934
- Mahogany. I'm
not gonna let you

1818
01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:20.270
and nobody else
hold me to my past.

1819
01:15:21.896 --> 01:15:25.567
Why do you keep
living in the past?

1820
01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:28.111
- Mom.

1821
01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:29.529
- Just because you are
allowing what happened

1822
01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:32.365
over 30 years ago ruin
your life don't mean

1823
01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:33.742
I'm gonna let it ruin mine.

1824
01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:38.038
- Ma.
(dramatic music)

1825
01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:40.915
all I was trying to do is

1826
01:15:40.957 --> 01:15:43.585
get you to understand
what I have been through.

1827
01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:46.338
what me and my sister
have been through

1828
01:15:46.379 --> 01:15:51.676
with the. with the men that
you brought into our lives.

1829
01:15:51.718 --> 01:15:55.597
You will never admit or say
sorry for anything. will you?

1830
01:15:57.182 --> 01:15:59.059
All I was trying to do
was just bring us closer

1831
01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.478
by admitting what me
and my sister had been

1832
01:16:01.519 --> 01:16:02.771
through with the men.

1833
01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:08.276
All I ever wanted was
for you to say I'm sorry

1834
01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:10.195
and forgive me.

1835
01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:12.655
(Mahogany sobbing)

1836
01:16:12.697 --> 01:16:16.618
- My being here right
now should be enough.

1837
01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.705
My past is my past.

1838
01:16:22.999 --> 01:16:23.792
- [Mahogany] Ma.

1839
01:16:27.545 --> 01:16:29.130
- Get over it.

1840
01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:31.341
- Ma.

1841
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:39.849
- So. you didn't get the I
love you. or the forgiveness.

1842
01:16:39.891 --> 01:16:43.395
or the I'm sorry that you
needed from your mother?

1843
01:16:43.436 --> 01:16:45.647
- Yes. in a way. I did.

1844
01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:48.566
You know. it was after
her funeral. though.

1845
01:16:48.608 --> 01:16:51.236
I found it in a
box of her things.

1846
01:16:51.277 --> 01:16:52.654
She had wrote me a letter.

1847
01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:57.492
But I wanted her to tell
me in person. you know.

1848
01:16:57.534 --> 01:16:59.661
to. to be there. you know.

1849
01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:03.790
to hug me like a
mother would do a child

1850
01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:05.458
when they're hurting.

1851
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.876
- I understand that.

1852
01:17:06.918 --> 01:17:09.212
I mean. you probably wanted
to hear those words directly

1853
01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.631
from your mother. and
I know that's hard

1854
01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:14.134
because that's a feeling
that we all long for.

1855
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:16.636
and it seems like she
just didn't love you

1856
01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:18.638
the way that she needed to.

1857
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.266
But you know. I think
she expressed herself

1858
01:17:21.307 --> 01:17:24.436
the only way she knew how.
and that was through a letter.

1859
01:17:24.477 --> 01:17:25.854
- Yeah.

1860
01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:28.148
- I mean. some people can't
express themselves verbally.

1861
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:30.650
And I mean. I learned
that from my own parents.

1862
01:17:30.692 --> 01:17:32.652
- I believe that. too.

1863
01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:35.905
You know. in so many ways.
I'm like her. (laughs)

1864
01:17:35.947 --> 01:17:38.658
You know. I express
myself and how I feel

1865
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.326
about people in my writing.

1866
01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:43.663
- Hmm. so did the letter.

1867
01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:45.874
did it give you any
comfort or any release?

1868
01:17:45.915 --> 01:17:47.542
How did you cope with her death?

1869
01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:50.879
- In a way. you know. I truly
felt my mother really loved me

1870
01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:54.215
and that she was sorry for
what I had been through.

1871
01:17:54.257 --> 01:17:55.508
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

1872
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:58.595
- She just didn't know how
to express it. you know?

1873
01:17:58.636 --> 01:18:02.807
But if she truly got
herself right with God.

1874
01:18:02.849 --> 01:18:05.268
(dramatic music continues)

1875
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:09.356
then I'm okay with that. and
that's okay with my soul.

1876
01:18:09.397 --> 01:18:11.483
- So. so let's switch gears.

1877
01:18:11.524 --> 01:18:12.609
Let's talk about
the events that led

1878
01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:14.861
to you divorcing
your third husband.

1879
01:18:16.404 --> 01:18:20.325
- Well. honestly.

1880
01:18:20.367 --> 01:18:21.951
I never seen this one coming.

1881
01:18:23.203 --> 01:18:26.289
No one could have ever
prepared me for this one.

1882
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:28.333
And do you know that
I was blamed again

1883
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.210
and told that this was my fault?

1884
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.587
All my life. I've been
told. "You know what?

1885
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:34.255
You brought this on yourself."

1886
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:38.677
And me and him. we
dated for two years

1887
01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:40.345
before we got married.

1888
01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:42.764
- So. everything was
good for two years.

1889
01:18:42.806 --> 01:18:46.226
I mean. no signs. nothing to
make you think differently?

1890
01:18:46.267 --> 01:18:48.687
- I mean. we had
our ups and downs

1891
01:18:48.728 --> 01:18:50.522
but nothing that we
couldn't work through.

1892
01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:54.651
And plus. he was the only
man that I ever trusted

1893
01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:56.611
besides my brother.

1894
01:18:56.653 --> 01:18:57.904
- Hmm.

1895
01:18:57.946 --> 01:19:00.365
- I never realized that I
was with a. a womanizer.

1896
01:19:00.407 --> 01:19:02.742
a. a. a narcissist. a liar.

1897
01:19:02.784 --> 01:19:05.954
a whoremonger. a manipulator.
(hand smacking)

1898
01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:09.124
So. are you ready
to hear this one?

1899
01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:11.126
- Yes.

1900
01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:14.546
- Now. your problem is
you got trust issues.

1901
01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:15.463
(Mahogany laughs)

1902
01:19:15.505 --> 01:19:16.840
Your past messed you all up.

1903
01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:20.427
- So. you gonna stand there
and act like I'm crazy. right?

1904
01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:23.763
Like in my heart. I didn't
see the Facebook messages

1905
01:19:23.805 --> 01:19:26.766
of you telling
women that I'm crazy

1906
01:19:26.808 --> 01:19:29.978
and that you're not
happy with me. Antares.

1907
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:30.937
Really?

1908
01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:32.605
Hmm.

1909
01:19:32.647 --> 01:19:34.566
If you're not happy.
then you can leave

1910
01:19:34.607 --> 01:19:36.776
'cause I'm not
begging you to stay.

1911
01:19:36.818 --> 01:19:40.822
- Like I said. you're
naive and dumb.

1912
01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:41.656
- Mm-hmm.

1913
01:19:41.698 --> 01:19:43.491
- They're lying to you.

1914
01:19:43.533 --> 01:19:44.701
The people I was with last night

1915
01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:46.870
I look at like sisters to me.

1916
01:19:46.911 --> 01:19:48.496
Woman. we grew up together.

1917
01:19:48.538 --> 01:19:51.416
- The only thing I did dumb is
believing that you were a man

1918
01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:53.960
of God when you're acting
like you're different

1919
01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:55.337
when you're all the same.

1920
01:19:56.796 --> 01:19:59.632
coming dressed up in God's
clothes. and reading God's word.

1921
01:19:59.674 --> 01:20:02.052
and you don't even
know nothing about it.

1922
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:04.262
God.

1923
01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:06.931
Just to get what you want.

1924
01:20:09.267 --> 01:20:13.271
- You know. your people probably
messed you up pretty bad.

1925
01:20:13.313 --> 01:20:16.024
but I'm only here
to help you out.

1926
01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:16.608
- Hmm.

1927
01:20:18.234 --> 01:20:19.486
Help me?
- Yeah.

1928
01:20:19.527 --> 01:20:20.445
- By lying to me?

1929
01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:22.822
Really. Antares?

1930
01:20:22.864 --> 01:20:24.366
You done lied.

1931
01:20:24.407 --> 01:20:25.825
You cheated with my cousin.

1932
01:20:25.867 --> 01:20:28.828
You cheated with my
goddaughter and lied

1933
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:30.538
and the women in
the ministry. too.

1934
01:20:31.623 --> 01:20:35.627
telling everybody that I'm
a witch and that I'm crazy.

1935
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.461
(Antares laugh)

1936
01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:37.837
Really. Antares?

1937
01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:39.881
- You see. that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1938
01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:41.424
You are crazy.

1939
01:20:41.466 --> 01:20:42.384
- [Mahogany] Mm.

1940
01:20:42.425 --> 01:20:43.635
- You believe all that mess

1941
01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:45.804
when the whole
time they want me.

1942
01:20:45.845 --> 01:20:47.889
Got you thinking I
really want them.

1943
01:20:49.015 --> 01:20:52.435
- You keep just acting like
I'm stupid and watch God.

1944
01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:54.354
(Antares sighs)

1945
01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:57.232
- Look here. babe.
I married you.

1946
01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:02.696
A lot of women wanted me.
but I decided to marry you.

1947
01:21:02.737 --> 01:21:08.576
So. your friends and your
little cousins are only jealous

1948
01:21:08.618 --> 01:21:09.411
'cause I don't want them.

1949
01:21:10.537 --> 01:21:13.456
- Wow. really. and
everybody wants Antares?

1950
01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:14.582
- You dang gone stippy

1951
01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:15.417
everybody wants me.
- Mm-hmm.

1952
01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:16.209
- Look at me.

1953
01:21:17.252 --> 01:21:18.044
I sing.

1954
01:21:19.295 --> 01:21:21.381
You know. every woman
loves a man that can sing.

1955
01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:22.799
- [Mahogany] Mm-hmm.

1956
01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:26.428
- I look good. and
I'm a good man.

1957
01:21:26.469 --> 01:21:29.431
So. don't let nobody
poison your little mind.

1958
01:21:29.472 --> 01:21:30.849
- Poison me?

1959
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:34.853
The only one poisoning me is
you with your lies. Antares.

1960
01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:37.897
Got people thinking I'm
crazy and I'm stupid.

1961
01:21:37.939 --> 01:21:38.940
You know what?

1962
01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:40.108
I'm just so over
this conversation.

1963
01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:41.943
I gotta go to ministry. too.

1964
01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:43.236
I'll talk to you later.

1965
01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:47.824
(footsteps plodding)

1966
01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:50.744
- You remarried. and
then this husband.

1967
01:21:50.785 --> 01:21:52.162
he's committing infidelity?

1968
01:21:52.203 --> 01:21:53.413
- Yes.

1969
01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:56.875
You know. and I waited
12 years to remarry.

1970
01:21:56.916 --> 01:21:58.418
(pen clicking)

1971
01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.546
and I thought that
this one was the one.

1972
01:22:01.588 --> 01:22:03.882
But. boy. was I wrong again.

1973
01:22:03.923 --> 01:22:05.342
- I know that had to
have been hurtful.

1974
01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:07.844
especially after you just
started trusting again

1975
01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:10.055
and falling in real love.

1976
01:22:10.096 --> 01:22:12.349
- Yeah. but maybe Lemar
was right. you know.

1977
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:15.477
that I'm just stupid and
dumb to believe in people.

1978
01:22:15.518 --> 01:22:19.439
- Mahogany. never feel
that you're dumb or stupid.

1979
01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:22.442
I mean. God has a purpose
and a plan for your life.

1980
01:22:22.484 --> 01:22:25.570
I mean. we all make mistakes.
and we trust the wrong people.

1981
01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:26.821
But give yourself some credit.

1982
01:22:26.863 --> 01:22:28.073
- Credit?

1983
01:22:28.114 --> 01:22:29.282
And I'm just tired of believing

1984
01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:31.409
that God has
something good for me.

1985
01:22:32.535 --> 01:22:35.789
Oh. God. you know.

1986
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:38.792
I will never. ever trust

1987
01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:41.961
or believe in a man
again in my life.

1988
01:22:42.003 --> 01:22:45.256
God. this man Antares
did the unthinkable.

1989
01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:46.841
- So. so. what did he do?

1990
01:22:46.883 --> 01:22:48.134
I mean. what was
the unthinkable.

1991
01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:50.512
I mean. to make
it be him or you?

1992
01:22:51.596 --> 01:22:55.308
- Let's just say he took me
back to my past. way back.

1993
01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:00.063
But this time. he stuck the
knife so deep in my heart

1994
01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:02.357
that there was no
return from this.

1995
01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:07.987
He had drained
the life outta me.

1996
01:23:08.029 --> 01:23:09.280
I became so cold.

1997
01:23:10.281 --> 01:23:14.244
You know. I gave this
man 15 years of my life.

1998
01:23:14.285 --> 01:23:15.036
- Wow.

1999
01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:18.164
- Oh. I can't believe this.

2000
01:23:18.206 --> 01:23:20.333
Can't wait till I
actually get. hey.

2001
01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:21.418
- Hey. girl.

2002
01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:22.961
- Ah. I was just
talking about you. girl.

2003
01:23:23.003 --> 01:23:24.921
Electra. God better come
down from heaven to Earth

2004
01:23:24.963 --> 01:23:26.339
and deal with me today.

2005
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:29.134
Look at this mess that this
devil wrote to my daughter.

2006
01:23:29.175 --> 01:23:30.927
I can't believe that he
would just do this to me.

2007
01:23:30.969 --> 01:23:32.429
Just read this mess.

2008
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:34.723
This don't make no sense. and
you might have to lock me up.

2009
01:23:34.764 --> 01:23:35.974
- Wait a minute.
- Girl.

2010
01:23:36.016 --> 01:23:36.933
- Just. just calm
down. Mahogany.

2011
01:23:36.975 --> 01:23:38.226
- Please.
- Calm down.

2012
01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:40.186
Nothing in the world is
that bad it make you want

2013
01:23:40.228 --> 01:23:41.146
to kill somebody.

2014
01:23:41.187 --> 01:23:42.647
(Mahogany scoffs and laughs)

2015
01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:44.858
Although you probably should
have killed him a long time ago

2016
01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:46.860
with all his cheating
and lying ways.

2017
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:48.278
And you already
know. personally. me.

2018
01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:49.529
I woulda killed him as soon

2019
01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:51.031
as I found out he was
sleeping with my cousin.

2020
01:23:51.072 --> 01:23:52.866
your so-called goddaughter.

2021
01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:53.908
- Just read that
mess right there

2022
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:56.036
because. after
today. he is dead.

2023
01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:57.537
I can promise you that.

2024
01:23:57.579 --> 01:24:00.915
I can't believe that this
scum with stoop this low.

2025
01:24:00.957 --> 01:24:01.875
Girl.

2026
01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:02.876
- Okay. I'm gonna read it.

2027
01:24:02.917 --> 01:24:04.002
I'm gonna read it. okay?

2028
01:24:04.044 --> 01:24:05.086
But I'm gonna tell you this.

2029
01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:06.379
I didn't come here
to catch no case.

2030
01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:08.965
- Mm-hmm.
- But I can. and I will.

2031
01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:10.383
(Mahogany scoffs)

2032
01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:12.385
- You might catch a couple
after you read that.

2033
01:24:12.427 --> 01:24:14.888
- Wait.
(Mahogany laughs)

2034
01:24:14.929 --> 01:24:16.181
What?
- Mm-hmm.

2035
01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:19.601
- What. what the heck?

2036
01:24:21.853 --> 01:24:23.063
You're kidding me. right?

2037
01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:24.647
(Mahogany laughs)

2038
01:24:24.689 --> 01:24:26.149
Girl. where is Diamond?

2039
01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:30.695
First of all. we not gonna
let this kill you. okay?

2040
01:24:30.737 --> 01:24:32.072
But give me a minute. baby girl.

2041
01:24:32.113 --> 01:24:34.240
'cause. uh. Lord
knows I need one.

2042
01:24:34.282 --> 01:24:35.325
Hold on.
- Mm-hmm.

2043
01:24:36.785 --> 01:24:38.536
- (sighs) Girl.

2044
01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:39.287
Wait a minute.

2045
01:24:40.497 --> 01:24:43.625
Did he just say. did he
just ask her for sex?

2046
01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:49.714
Talking about sit on
his face for $50. $50?

2047
01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:50.590
Oh. no.

2048
01:24:50.632 --> 01:24:51.758
(Mahogany clicks tongue)

2049
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.301
- Now you see why I
want to kill this devil?

2050
01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:56.012
- He. girl. he say that
he been digging her

2051
01:24:56.054 --> 01:24:57.514
for the last 10 years.

2052
01:24:57.555 --> 01:24:58.181
(Mahogany scoffs)

2053
01:24:58.223 --> 01:24:59.265
10 years. Mahogany?

2054
01:24:59.307 --> 01:25:00.558
- [Mahogany] Mm-hmm.

2055
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.768
- That's 10 years
of your marriage.

2056
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:02.602
- I don't wanna hear it.

2057
01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:03.770
I know.

2058
01:25:03.812 --> 01:25:06.106
- Girl. where is Diamond?

2059
01:25:06.147 --> 01:25:07.023
(Mahogany laughs)

2060
01:25:07.065 --> 01:25:08.441
- She don't wanna be here.

2061
01:25:08.483 --> 01:25:09.943
Electra. she blaming
herself thinking

2062
01:25:09.984 --> 01:25:11.861
she did something
wrong just for coming

2063
01:25:11.903 --> 01:25:15.281
down to help her mom while
I do my chemo treatments.

2064
01:25:15.323 --> 01:25:17.367
- This is not Diamond's fault.

2065
01:25:17.409 --> 01:25:19.119
It's that man's fault.

2066
01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.370
How in the world
can he wanna sleep

2067
01:25:20.412 --> 01:25:22.163
with his own wife's daughter?

2068
01:25:22.914 --> 01:25:23.873
You know what. sis?

2069
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:27.961
It's time to cut that little
thingy thing thing he got

2070
01:25:28.003 --> 01:25:29.212
he called a snake.

2071
01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:30.714
We need to cut it off
and hand it to him

2072
01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:31.965
on a silver platter-

2073
01:25:32.007 --> 01:25:34.801
- Yeah.
- 'cause he just nasty.

2074
01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:35.677
But you know what?

2075
01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:39.389
I'm just saying I always
thought it was a man lover.

2076
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:40.598
- Hmm.

2077
01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.517
Now. you see why I want
to kill this monster?

2078
01:25:42.559 --> 01:25:46.146
- I am so hurt for
you. Mahogany. girl.
for you even trying

2079
01:25:46.187 --> 01:25:48.732
to stay and work things
out in this marriage-

2080
01:25:48.773 --> 01:25:49.441
- Ugh.
- after all

2081
01:25:49.482 --> 01:25:50.859
he's put you through.

2082
01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.154
- Yeah. just imagine how
my daughter felt. Electra.

2083
01:25:54.195 --> 01:25:55.780
She don't wanna be here.

2084
01:25:55.822 --> 01:25:58.658
You know what. this marriage.
though. it is completely over.

2085
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.118
It's finished.

2086
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.371
No man is gonna ever
come between me and mine.

2087
01:26:03.413 --> 01:26:07.792
You know. I am not my mother.
and I would never be her.

2088
01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:09.919
- Diamond looked up
to him as a father.

2089
01:26:09.961 --> 01:26:11.254
- Mm-hmm.

2090
01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:13.590
- And I never seen her look
at him in any other way.

2091
01:26:13.631 --> 01:26:14.591
(Mahogany laughs)

2092
01:26:14.632 --> 01:26:15.342
(Electra laughs)

2093
01:26:15.383 --> 01:26:17.177
For him to disrespect you-

2094
01:26:17.218 --> 01:26:19.346
- Yeah.
- as her mother

2095
01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:21.014
and her as his daughter-

2096
01:26:21.056 --> 01:26:22.349
- Hmm.

2097
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:26.353
- Girl. right here makes
me want to hate him.

2098
01:26:26.394 --> 01:26:28.146
- I know.
- Oh. girl.

2099
01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:30.482
I do hate him.

2100
01:26:30.523 --> 01:26:33.526
No. (laughs) matter of fact.
hate is an understatement.

2101
01:26:33.568 --> 01:26:34.694
- Hmm.

2102
01:26:34.736 --> 01:26:37.030
- If I could lose
my job at the prison

2103
01:26:37.072 --> 01:26:38.948
for castrating his butt myself-

2104
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.866
- Mm-hmm.

2105
01:26:39.908 --> 01:26:41.117
- girl. you know I would.

2106
01:26:41.159 --> 01:26:42.243
- Yeah.

2107
01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:43.411
- But you know what?

2108
01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:44.537
- Hmm?

2109
01:26:44.579 --> 01:26:46.748
- I wouldn't kill
him. though. mm-mm.

2110
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.834
No. but I'd make him suffer.
(dramatic music)

2111
01:26:49.876 --> 01:26:50.669
(Electra laughs)

2112
01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:52.379
He got to suffer slowly. girl.

2113
01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.047
He got to feel the burn.

2114
01:26:54.089 --> 01:26:54.881
(Mahogany laughs)

2115
01:26:54.923 --> 01:26:56.299
- You know. people were saying

2116
01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.842
that I was making a big
mistake by marrying this devil.

2117
01:26:57.884 --> 01:27:01.513
that he would destroy the
woman of God I was becoming.

2118
01:27:01.554 --> 01:27:03.223
I'm tired of Antares Noble.

2119
01:27:03.264 --> 01:27:05.225
I. I've dealt with a lot myself.

2120
01:27:05.266 --> 01:27:07.894
I mean. I dealt with his
disrespect. his lies.

2121
01:27:07.936 --> 01:27:10.355
his cheating his
womanizing ways.

2122
01:27:10.397 --> 01:27:11.189
It's right here.

2123
01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:12.440
It's just. it cuts.

2124
01:27:12.482 --> 01:27:13.817
It's. it's overkill.

2125
01:27:13.858 --> 01:27:15.902
You know. Diamond
was hurt to the core.

2126
01:27:15.944 --> 01:27:18.321
She didn't even wanna
tell me this. Electra.

2127
01:27:18.363 --> 01:27:20.240
- Girl. you know. Diamond
never would wanna hurt you

2128
01:27:20.281 --> 01:27:21.366
in this way.

2129
01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:23.076
You know that.

2130
01:27:23.118 --> 01:27:24.244
But the best thing about this

2131
01:27:24.285 --> 01:27:25.745
that you and her
relationship is tight.

2132
01:27:25.787 --> 01:27:27.956
So. y'all gonna come
through this together.

2133
01:27:27.997 --> 01:27:30.625
The only thing was that
that man never once thought

2134
01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:32.836
for a second that she
was gonna bring this

2135
01:27:32.877 --> 01:27:34.212
to your attention.
- Mm.

2136
01:27:34.254 --> 01:27:36.673
- And that's because he was
built straight from hell.

2137
01:27:36.715 --> 01:27:38.174
- Hmm.

2138
01:27:38.216 --> 01:27:40.510
You know. my baby
wanted to make me happy

2139
01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:42.512
by never coming around again.

2140
01:27:42.554 --> 01:27:45.765
And I had to let her know.
no. the devil is a liar.

2141
01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:48.101
You just gave me my
keys to unlock that door

2142
01:27:48.143 --> 01:27:50.103
that the devil tried
to set up for me.

2143
01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:51.146
(dramatic music continues)

2144
01:27:51.187 --> 01:27:52.605
- And that's exactly
what God did-

2145
01:27:52.647 --> 01:27:54.899
- Mm-hmm.
- is released you.

2146
01:27:54.941 --> 01:27:56.151
(Mahogany scoffs)

2147
01:27:56.192 --> 01:28:00.071
- Girl. God wants you to
run and don't look back.

2148
01:28:00.113 --> 01:28:03.616
You know. your first true love
is out there waiting for you.

2149
01:28:03.658 --> 01:28:05.702
He just waiting for
you to be free. sis.

2150
01:28:05.744 --> 01:28:07.620
- I just can't believe
that right now for me.

2151
01:28:07.662 --> 01:28:10.206
I'm just tired of
dealing with men.

2152
01:28:10.248 --> 01:28:12.625
I used to pray about
my first love. though.

2153
01:28:12.667 --> 01:28:15.795
the young guy that used to
love on me when we were little.

2154
01:28:15.837 --> 01:28:17.630
You know. every time
I would get hurt.

2155
01:28:17.672 --> 01:28:19.215
he would be right
there caring for me.

2156
01:28:19.257 --> 01:28:20.717
- Mm.
- And he would say.

2157
01:28:20.759 --> 01:28:23.053
"Mahogany. I'm gonna marry
you when we get older."

2158
01:28:23.094 --> 01:28:24.512
(Mahogany laughs)

2159
01:28:24.554 --> 01:28:25.930
But I guess God just didn't
have those cards dealt for me.

2160
01:28:25.972 --> 01:28:27.974
- Hey. you don't know what
God got in store for you.

2161
01:28:28.016 --> 01:28:29.184
- Hmm.

2162
01:28:29.225 --> 01:28:30.560
- Hey. maybe after you
get through all of this.

2163
01:28:30.602 --> 01:28:32.312
we can call him. look him up
and call him or something.

2164
01:28:32.354 --> 01:28:34.022
Maybe we could talk to
him a little bit. yay.

2165
01:28:34.064 --> 01:28:37.317
- Mm. nah. I care less to
be with a man right now.

2166
01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:38.735
I can't trust one.
(dramatic music continues)

2167
01:28:38.777 --> 01:28:41.321
Plus. I heard from a
mutual friend of me and his

2168
01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:44.199
that he was probably on
drugs or locked up somewhere.

2169
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.618
- Well. I only can
imagine who told you that.

2170
01:28:46.659 --> 01:28:48.036
- Mm.

2171
01:28:48.078 --> 01:28:49.829
- She been jealous of you guys
anyway from the beginning.

2172
01:28:49.871 --> 01:28:51.164
- Mm-hmm.

2173
01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:52.665
- Matter of fact. if I'm
not mistaken. she is the one

2174
01:28:52.707 --> 01:28:55.960
that actually. uh. convinced
you to marry that devil.

2175
01:28:56.002 --> 01:28:57.128
(Mahogany scoffs)

2176
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:58.046
So. whatever she's
saying out her mouth.

2177
01:28:58.088 --> 01:28:59.422
I'm pretty sure she lying.

2178
01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.841
- (clicks tongue) I just
can't. it don't matter anyway

2179
01:29:01.883 --> 01:29:05.136
because I don't want to
be married ever again.

2180
01:29:06.554 --> 01:29:08.973
You know. there's
no. no difference

2181
01:29:09.015 --> 01:29:11.267
in marrying a worldly
man and a godly man.

2182
01:29:11.309 --> 01:29:12.185
They're all the same.

2183
01:29:12.227 --> 01:29:13.311
All they want is a little sex.

2184
01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:14.688
When you can't give
it to 'em. please.

2185
01:29:14.729 --> 01:29:16.147
I'm good.

2186
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:17.399
Hmm. I'm good.

2187
01:29:18.233 --> 01:29:20.318
- God does have
that one for you.

2188
01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.111
Now. look.

2189
01:29:21.152 --> 01:29:22.529
- Hmm?

2190
01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:24.572
- We all do make bad choices.
and sometimes we just got

2191
01:29:24.614 --> 01:29:26.366
to live and learn by them.

2192
01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:27.617
When I read that. I was ready

2193
01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:30.704
to take this man's life
right there with you.

2194
01:29:30.745 --> 01:29:31.913
- Mm-hmm.

2195
01:29:31.955 --> 01:29:33.164
- But then I realized
he wasn't worth it.

2196
01:29:33.206 --> 01:29:34.499
- Mm-hmm.

2197
01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:36.418
- And this is God got
something in store for you.

2198
01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:38.503
and this is not how
your story ends.

2199
01:29:38.545 --> 01:29:39.671
- But look at what I brought

2200
01:29:39.713 --> 01:29:41.548
around me and my children again.

2201
01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:44.801
another failed relationship.
someone to come in

2202
01:29:44.843 --> 01:29:47.137
and hurt me and my
child in this way.

2203
01:29:47.178 --> 01:29:50.306
I just blamed it on the fact
that his. his father was

2204
01:29:50.348 --> 01:29:52.183
a cheater throughout
his upbringing.

2205
01:29:52.225 --> 01:29:53.852
so he thought it was normal.

2206
01:29:53.893 --> 01:29:57.605
And I prayed. "God deliver
this man." you know.

2207
01:29:57.647 --> 01:30:00.442
but nothing worked.
not even my prayers.

2208
01:30:00.483 --> 01:30:01.401
(dramatic music continues)

2209
01:30:01.443 --> 01:30:03.236
- Listen. Mahogany. when I read

2210
01:30:03.278 --> 01:30:04.279
that thing he wrote to Diamond-

2211
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.321
- Yeah.
- girl. first thing

2212
01:30:05.363 --> 01:30:07.449
I thought is his
phone was stolen.

2213
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:09.492
somebody done hacked
into it or something

2214
01:30:09.534 --> 01:30:11.286
'cause there's no
way in the world

2215
01:30:11.327 --> 01:30:12.454
that Antares would
write this to Diamond.

2216
01:30:12.495 --> 01:30:15.832
- Yeah. me too. until
I got to that part

2217
01:30:15.874 --> 01:30:18.918
where he started mentioning
places we used to stay

2218
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.962
and to talk to my
daughter about things

2219
01:30:21.004 --> 01:30:23.715
that we talked about in our
marriage. in the bedroom.

2220
01:30:23.757 --> 01:30:26.551
things I didn't want to
do to his stinking behind.

2221
01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:30.930
What evil is out there
that hates me so much

2222
01:30:30.972 --> 01:30:33.600
that it would want to
destroy my life in this way?

2223
01:30:33.641 --> 01:30:38.688
You know. I. I mean. I guess
this is the plan for my life.

2224
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:43.401
- You are a phenomenal
wife. beautiful woman.

2225
01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:46.321
a good grandmother and mother.

2226
01:30:46.363 --> 01:30:49.407
Don't let nobody tell
anything different.

2227
01:30:49.449 --> 01:30:51.576
I gotta go to work.

2228
01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:54.454
But if you need me to stay.
I'll call in right now.

2229
01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:57.290
and I'll stay right here
and help put this devil out.

2230
01:30:57.332 --> 01:30:59.918
- No. I need to
handle this on my own.

2231
01:30:59.959 --> 01:31:00.835
- Are you sure?

2232
01:31:02.253 --> 01:31:04.589
Girl. 'cause if he says
anything or do anything to you.

2233
01:31:04.631 --> 01:31:07.801
there is nothing on this
Earth that's gonna stop me

2234
01:31:07.842 --> 01:31:11.346
from protecting my. my
girl. my best friend.

2235
01:31:11.388 --> 01:31:13.515
- Mm-hmm. I know.

2236
01:31:13.556 --> 01:31:14.808
I'll be okay.

2237
01:31:14.849 --> 01:31:18.144
Antares Noble is
not crazy. you know.

2238
01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:22.482
I need to make sure
that he pack his things

2239
01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:25.151
and that I deal
with this on my own.

2240
01:31:25.193 --> 01:31:29.781
You know. this is my marriage.
and he just lost his wife.

2241
01:31:29.823 --> 01:31:32.158
- Okay. well. you know
I love you. right?

2242
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.993
- Yes. and I love you. too.

2243
01:31:34.035 --> 01:31:35.745
- I want you to
take care of you.

2244
01:31:35.787 --> 01:31:37.414
- I am.
- You hear me?

2245
01:31:37.455 --> 01:31:38.915
We already know that your
blood pressure's high.

2246
01:31:38.957 --> 01:31:40.417
and you're not the
best of health.

2247
01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:42.502
- I know it. but
you said it right.

2248
01:31:42.544 --> 01:31:43.461
God got me.

2249
01:31:43.503 --> 01:31:44.713
- Mm-hmm. and he does.

2250
01:31:44.754 --> 01:31:46.297
- Mm-hmm.
- And so do I.

2251
01:31:46.339 --> 01:31:47.465
your ride or die.

2252
01:31:47.507 --> 01:31:48.508
- Yes.

2253
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:50.260
- All right. sugar.

2254
01:31:50.301 --> 01:31:51.136
I love you.

2255
01:31:51.177 --> 01:31:52.053
- I love you. too.

2256
01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:52.929
- All right. baby.

2257
01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:53.680
- Call me when you get to work.

2258
01:31:53.722 --> 01:31:54.931
- Get my darn water.

2259
01:31:54.973 --> 01:31:56.391
what I came for.
- Mm-hmm. (laughs)

2260
01:31:56.433 --> 01:31:57.225
Love you.

2261
01:31:57.267 --> 01:31:57.976
- [Electra] Love you.

2262
01:32:01.771 --> 01:32:06.067
- Lord. what have I
done to deserve this?

2263
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:09.029
You better come in
and step in right now

2264
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.990
'cause I'm ready
to kill this man.

2265
01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:12.741
God.

2266
01:32:13.783 --> 01:32:16.578
I am not my mother.

2267
01:32:16.619 --> 01:32:17.579
- My God.

2268
01:32:19.247 --> 01:32:20.415
(Celeste sighs)

2269
01:32:20.457 --> 01:32:21.541
Come here.

2270
01:32:21.583 --> 01:32:23.168
- Thank you.

2271
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.918
- Mm.

2272
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:26.463
- Thank you.

2273
01:32:26.504 --> 01:32:28.798
(gentle music)

2274
01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.717
And are you ready to
finish hearing this?

2275
01:32:30.759 --> 01:32:34.554
- Yes. because I believe
your story needs to be heard.

2276
01:32:34.596 --> 01:32:35.889
I mean. we were talking

2277
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:37.932
about you finished off
with your best friend.

2278
01:32:37.974 --> 01:32:40.018
You was telling her
about the text messages

2279
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.438
that your daughter shared
with you about what he said.

2280
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.899
by the way. which
was despicable.

2281
01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:49.069
How can somebody love
you or. or say their vows

2282
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:53.198
and do something like that
to you or their child?

2283
01:32:53.239 --> 01:32:55.200
Did you confront him about that?

2284
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:56.409
(gentle music continues)

2285
01:32:56.451 --> 01:32:58.578
- You know. my mother
said he was a dog.

2286
01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.829
- Hmm.

2287
01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:01.706
- But a dog was
a understatement.

2288
01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:04.292
He didn't even know.

2289
01:33:05.502 --> 01:33:08.922
You know. Antares came
home from work. (laughs)

2290
01:33:08.963 --> 01:33:11.925
acting like he. you know.
was all having a good day.

2291
01:33:11.966 --> 01:33:14.803
and he had just hit the
lottery or something.

2292
01:33:14.844 --> 01:33:17.013
styling and profiling.

2293
01:33:17.055 --> 01:33:18.098
- [Celeste] Mm.

2294
01:33:18.139 --> 01:33:19.766
- He didn't know I
knew what he did.

2295
01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:24.854
* Move on in the water
from grandma's home

2296
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:27.982
- Mm. hey.

2297
01:33:28.775 --> 01:33:30.026
What's wrong with you?

2298
01:33:31.611 --> 01:33:33.196
And why you got it
all dark up in here

2299
01:33:33.238 --> 01:33:34.406
looking like somebody died?

2300
01:33:35.865 --> 01:33:38.868
You. you know. I shoulda
stayed at my cousin house

2301
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:41.746
if I'da known I'll be coming
home to something like this.

2302
01:33:41.788 --> 01:33:43.581
- Then. maybe you should have.

2303
01:33:43.623 --> 01:33:45.542
- Oh. here we go again.

2304
01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:48.253
You. you know. for you
to be such a woman of God

2305
01:33:48.294 --> 01:33:51.589
that you proclaim to be. you
really be allowing the devil

2306
01:33:51.631 --> 01:33:53.425
to use you a lot.

2307
01:33:53.466 --> 01:33:55.093
- Antares. I believe
you're talking

2308
01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:58.471
about yourself right now
'cause I am good with God.

2309
01:33:58.513 --> 01:34:00.098
Believe that.

2310
01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.226
As a matter of fact. you
probably should be asking God

2311
01:34:03.268 --> 01:34:04.811
if you're in his good graces.

2312
01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:08.523
- Oh. God. here we go again
with this mental mess.

2313
01:34:08.565 --> 01:34:09.482
I mean-

2314
01:34:09.524 --> 01:34:10.650
- Who-
- You don't even realize

2315
01:34:10.692 --> 01:34:13.528
how damaged you are
in the head. do you?

2316
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:15.321
(Mahogany laughs)

2317
01:34:15.363 --> 01:34:17.824
I'm starting to see why
everybody in your past left you.

2318
01:34:17.866 --> 01:34:19.868
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean. for real.

2319
01:34:19.909 --> 01:34:21.703
Even your kids talk about you.

2320
01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:24.080
- You better leave my
kids' name out your mouth

2321
01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:26.541
and worry about why
yours don't wanna deal

2322
01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:28.001
with you with your fake self.

2323
01:34:28.043 --> 01:34:31.004
- Once again. here you
go mentally abusing me.

2324
01:34:31.046 --> 01:34:31.838
- Please.

2325
01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.089
- Well. you better be glad-

2326
01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:35.133
- Oh. Jesus.
- I stay with your sorry butt

2327
01:34:35.175 --> 01:34:37.844
'cause I can have
any woman I want.

2328
01:34:37.886 --> 01:34:41.556
- Then. they can
have you after today.

2329
01:34:41.598 --> 01:34:42.682
and they better be worrying

2330
01:34:42.724 --> 01:34:44.684
about what kinda
devil they're bringing

2331
01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:47.187
around their children
and family members.

2332
01:34:47.228 --> 01:34:49.189
- Good. 'cause any
place would be better

2333
01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:51.566
than staying here with
you and your crazy butt.

2334
01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:52.776
(Mahogany laughs)

2335
01:34:52.817 --> 01:34:55.111
I only stayed this long
'cause I feel sorry.

2336
01:34:55.153 --> 01:34:55.820
(Mahogany laughs)

2337
01:34:55.862 --> 01:34:56.738
And I was only trying

2338
01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.073
to help you.
- Jesus.

2339
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.451
(Mahogany mumbling)

2340
01:35:01.493 --> 01:35:03.828
(laughing) Oh.

2341
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.372
- Look what I'm talking about.

2342
01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:08.541
You know. something is
really wrong with you. woman.

2343
01:35:08.583 --> 01:35:09.584
- [Mahogany] Mm-hmm.

2344
01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.670
- You're damaged. bad.

2345
01:35:11.711 --> 01:35:15.006
- Yeah. you. something
is really wrong with me.

2346
01:35:15.048 --> 01:35:18.051
so you said something
right for once.

2347
01:35:18.093 --> 01:35:20.637
So. what is this you
text my daughter?

2348
01:35:20.679 --> 01:35:22.681
- Man. what you talking about?

2349
01:35:22.722 --> 01:35:24.057
I told you your
daughter be nothing

2350
01:35:24.099 --> 01:35:25.558
but trouble staying here.
(dramatic music)

2351
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.769
She ain't got no
respect for you or I.

2352
01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:29.688
coming in this house
any time of night.

2353
01:35:29.729 --> 01:35:31.690
- So. you really
gonna stand here

2354
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:33.733
and lie of my face. Antares.

2355
01:35:33.775 --> 01:35:36.277
and act like I don't know
what I'm talking about?

2356
01:35:36.319 --> 01:35:38.738
Since I. since you forgot.
let me read this text.

2357
01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.323
(dramatic music continues)

2358
01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:44.953
"So. if you come sit
on my face for $50

2359
01:35:44.994 --> 01:35:49.582
because your mother don't
want to try anything new"?

2360
01:35:49.624 --> 01:35:50.959
- Now. baby. hold on.

2361
01:35:52.252 --> 01:35:54.587
Now. now. I was only texting
her because you been going

2362
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:55.755
through withdrawals
lately. you know.

2363
01:35:55.797 --> 01:35:57.674
acting like you don't love me.

2364
01:35:57.716 --> 01:35:58.800
You're reading this all wrong.

2365
01:35:58.842 --> 01:36:00.719
- Oh. really. I'm
reading this all wrong?

2366
01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.178
Then. let me continue. Antares.

2367
01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:06.766
"You. you know. I've been
wanting you. to make love

2368
01:36:06.808 --> 01:36:09.060
to you since you. we
lived on Beach Boulevard.

2369
01:36:09.102 --> 01:36:12.772
and all. I always wanted
your mother instead of you

2370
01:36:12.814 --> 01:36:14.315
to tell you the truth."

2371
01:36:14.357 --> 01:36:15.400
- Baby. what are you doing?

2372
01:36:15.442 --> 01:36:18.778
Hey. your. your
daughter's lying on me.

2373
01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.114
I told you it'd be a bad
idea for her to stay here.

2374
01:36:21.156 --> 01:36:23.408
- You worthless piece of scum.

2375
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.826
(dramatic music continues)

2376
01:36:24.868 --> 01:36:26.661
How could you do this?

2377
01:36:26.703 --> 01:36:28.830
My daughter's never
done anything to you

2378
01:36:28.872 --> 01:36:32.751
but treat you like a
stepfather. Antares.

2379
01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:36.129
How could you do this
to me. my family?

2380
01:36:37.672 --> 01:36:39.591
- Baby. please.

2381
01:36:39.632 --> 01:36:41.676
Your daughter's lying on me.

2382
01:36:41.718 --> 01:36:43.553
Every time you
leave for treatment.

2383
01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:47.140
she be walking around the
house half naked looking at me.

2384
01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:49.267
saying all this negative
stuff about you.

2385
01:36:49.309 --> 01:36:51.061
- Stop with the lies.
(dramatic music continues)

2386
01:36:51.102 --> 01:36:53.480
My daughter's never
done anything to you.

2387
01:36:53.521 --> 01:36:57.859
Antares. you better leave
now before I catch a case.

2388
01:36:59.527 --> 01:37:02.864
I know too much to allow you
to think that this is okay.

2389
01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:05.742
- [Antares] I don't
know why I did it.

2390
01:37:05.784 --> 01:37:07.577
Maybe I ain't want nobody
else staying with us.

2391
01:37:07.619 --> 01:37:08.828
and this was the only way

2392
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:10.330
I could get your
daughter to leave.

2393
01:37:10.372 --> 01:37:13.249
- If my kids needed me.
Antares. I should be able

2394
01:37:13.291 --> 01:37:17.045
to be there just like I
was there for your kids.

2395
01:37:18.338 --> 01:37:22.092
and when my daughter. when I
got sick. when she came home

2396
01:37:22.133 --> 01:37:24.386
when I got sick
and I needed help.

2397
01:37:25.387 --> 01:37:27.764
- [Antares] Baby. really
think about this now.

2398
01:37:27.806 --> 01:37:29.140
It's your fault
in the first place

2399
01:37:29.182 --> 01:37:31.685
for allowing your grown
daughter to stay here.

2400
01:37:31.726 --> 01:37:33.687
I ain't never want
her in this house.

2401
01:37:33.728 --> 01:37:34.729
(dramatic music continues)

2402
01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:35.980
You were careless
with your child.

2403
01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:39.651
(Mahogany whimpering)

2404
01:37:39.693 --> 01:37:44.739
- You better leave now before
the devil make me do something

2405
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:46.449
to you or something that you use

2406
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:47.659
and think about all the time.

2407
01:37:48.868 --> 01:37:52.330
I'm not my mother.
and I won't be.

2408
01:37:52.372 --> 01:37:55.500
so the next time I
pull this trigger.

2409
01:37:55.542 --> 01:37:57.335
this gun is not gonna jam.

2410
01:37:58.294 --> 01:37:59.045
Leave.

2411
01:37:59.087 --> 01:38:01.256
Get out. devil. Leave.

2412
01:38:01.297 --> 01:38:02.757
- It's terrible that
it got to that point

2413
01:38:02.799 --> 01:38:04.592
where you felt like
you needed a weapon.

2414
01:38:04.634 --> 01:38:05.927
- Like I said. Ms. White. I.

2415
01:38:07.387 --> 01:38:10.765
he took me to a place
of no return. you know?

2416
01:38:10.807 --> 01:38:14.811
But when I was younger.
I didn't have no way

2417
01:38:14.853 --> 01:38:16.938
of defending myself.
you know. against any

2418
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.065
of the monsters
that was hurting me.

2419
01:38:19.107 --> 01:38:22.527
But when I turned 14
years old. I fought.

2420
01:38:22.569 --> 01:38:24.154
I fought a lot.

2421
01:38:24.195 --> 01:38:28.742
You know. I. I had to fight
my adopted foster siblings.

2422
01:38:28.783 --> 01:38:32.120
and I didn't allow
anybody to hurt me

2423
01:38:33.455 --> 01:38:35.415
by any means necessary.

2424
01:38:35.457 --> 01:38:38.960
- So. so you're saying that
you were being in situations

2425
01:38:39.002 --> 01:38:41.796
that made you become
violent in that way?

2426
01:38:41.838 --> 01:38:42.714
- (clicks tongue) Yeah.

2427
01:38:44.132 --> 01:38:46.760
I mean. I was in so many
foster homes that I lost count.

2428
01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:48.970
you know. and like
I said before.

2429
01:38:49.012 --> 01:38:50.847
the siblings that I had
in those foster homes.

2430
01:38:50.889 --> 01:38:52.098
they weren't cool. you know.

2431
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.142
They. they fought me
for no reason at all.

2432
01:38:54.184 --> 01:38:55.352
(dramatic music continues)

2433
01:38:55.393 --> 01:39:00.106
But when I was 16 years
old. I got adopted.

2434
01:39:01.775 --> 01:39:02.901
- Hmm. okay. wow.

2435
01:39:02.942 --> 01:39:04.694
I mean. they must
have really liked you

2436
01:39:04.736 --> 01:39:06.321
to adopt you at 16.

2437
01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:07.364
- Yeah.

2438
01:39:07.405 --> 01:39:09.407
It was a woman I
met at a hospital.

2439
01:39:10.325 --> 01:39:11.743
Ms. White. she saved my life.

2440
01:39:12.827 --> 01:39:13.953
- Wow. that's wonderful.

2441
01:39:13.995 --> 01:39:15.163
Is she still alive?

2442
01:39:15.955 --> 01:39:17.457
- No.

2443
01:39:17.499 --> 01:39:18.291
- [Celeste] Hmm.

2444
01:39:18.333 --> 01:39:19.959
- She passed away from cancer.

2445
01:39:20.001 --> 01:39:20.794
(dramatic music continues)

2446
01:39:20.835 --> 01:39:22.045
- Sorry to hear that.

2447
01:39:22.087 --> 01:39:23.505
- Thank you.

2448
01:39:23.546 --> 01:39:25.799
- So. that situation with
your husband. I mean.

2449
01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.966
did that make it. make you feel

2450
01:39:27.008 --> 01:39:28.635
like you were being attacked?

2451
01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:30.053
(Mahogany laughs)

2452
01:39:30.095 --> 01:39:31.805
- Yeah. but it was a. it was
a different type of attack.

2453
01:39:31.846 --> 01:39:33.973
This attack was on my character.

2454
01:39:34.015 --> 01:39:34.808
- [Celeste] Mm.

2455
01:39:34.849 --> 01:39:36.184
- It was on my heart.

2456
01:39:36.226 --> 01:39:38.103
It was how I received and
how I looked at people

2457
01:39:38.144 --> 01:39:40.939
and the love that. that
I was supposed to have.

2458
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.858
you know. from. from others.

2459
01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.151
This was different.

2460
01:39:45.193 --> 01:39:46.403
(dramatic music continues)

2461
01:39:46.444 --> 01:39:49.114
You know. it took me
way back to my past.

2462
01:39:49.155 --> 01:39:52.033
- So. earlier you
were telling a story.

2463
01:39:52.075 --> 01:39:53.993
You said you didn't want
to be like your mother.

2464
01:39:54.035 --> 01:39:56.663
I mean. tell me a little
bit more about that.

2465
01:39:56.705 --> 01:39:58.039
What did you mean by that?

2466
01:39:58.081 --> 01:40:00.000
- (exhales) When I
was 17. Ms. White-

2467
01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:01.167
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

2468
01:40:01.209 --> 01:40:02.293
- I went to go visit my mother.

2469
01:40:02.335 --> 01:40:03.211
- Mm-hmm.

2470
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.719
- And her boyfriend.
her boyfriend raped me.

2471
01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.970
- Oh. my gosh.

2472
01:40:12.012 --> 01:40:13.680
- And I told her right
away what happened.

2473
01:40:13.722 --> 01:40:16.808
and she didn't believe me even
when my little sister tried

2474
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.352
to tell her he did this to her.

2475
01:40:19.394 --> 01:40:20.395
- Oh. wow.

2476
01:40:20.437 --> 01:40:21.896
- She didn't believe
what we said.

2477
01:40:21.938 --> 01:40:22.856
She decided to believe him.

2478
01:40:22.897 --> 01:40:24.065
She chose him.

2479
01:40:25.191 --> 01:40:29.529
- Wow. so. so your
husband trying to sleep

2480
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:31.364
with your daughter. I mean.
that had to make you feel

2481
01:40:31.406 --> 01:40:33.950
like you were reliving the past.

2482
01:40:33.992 --> 01:40:34.743
- Yeah.

2483
01:40:35.744 --> 01:40:37.037
(Mahogany sniffs)

2484
01:40:37.078 --> 01:40:41.624
You know. I felt like
God was punishing me.

2485
01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:43.710
- Mm-hmm. wow.

2486
01:40:43.752 --> 01:40:47.881
- You know. because of. by
sending all these different men

2487
01:40:47.922 --> 01:40:50.050
in my life. it wasn't no good

2488
01:40:50.091 --> 01:40:53.678
because of how I treated
the man that loved me.

2489
01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.471
- Hmm.

2490
01:40:55.805 --> 01:40:57.932
Well. Mahogany. I will say.

2491
01:40:57.974 --> 01:40:59.642
I believe all your
sins are forgiven.

2492
01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:03.271
I believe that. once you
dedicated your life to Christ.

2493
01:41:03.313 --> 01:41:05.023
that he wiped everything clean.

2494
01:41:05.065 --> 01:41:07.984
No more shall that
be your report.

2495
01:41:08.026 --> 01:41:10.028
but that should
be your testimony.

2496
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:12.322
(dramatic music continues)

2497
01:41:12.364 --> 01:41:15.450
- I hear you. and I have heard
and read that in the word.

2498
01:41:16.701 --> 01:41:19.954
that if we confess our sins.
then God will cleanse us.

2499
01:41:19.996 --> 01:41:21.748
You know. in Michael
7:19. it talks

2500
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:25.585
about God will cleanse
our sins and cast them

2501
01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:28.630
to the sea of forgiveness if
we confess with our hearts

2502
01:41:28.672 --> 01:41:33.134
and truly believe. never
to be spoken of again.

2503
01:41:33.176 --> 01:41:34.719
Do we reap what we sow?

2504
01:41:35.762 --> 01:41:38.515
- Mm. listen. I mean.
we all have that cross

2505
01:41:38.556 --> 01:41:42.102
to carry on judgment day.
I mean. including me.

2506
01:41:42.143 --> 01:41:43.228
(dramatic music continues)

2507
01:41:43.269 --> 01:41:44.729
But I know that God
is a merciful god.

2508
01:41:45.814 --> 01:41:49.359
and I know he knows the
heart of all his children.

2509
01:41:49.401 --> 01:41:51.027
and through your long
suffering. Mahogany.

2510
01:41:51.069 --> 01:41:52.612
he has something greater

2511
01:41:52.654 --> 01:41:55.782
than you. than you
can even imagine.

2512
01:41:55.824 --> 01:41:57.742
(dramatic music continues)

2513
01:41:57.784 --> 01:41:59.869
- I find myself asking God.

2514
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:04.457
"Why did you save me. huh.

2515
01:42:04.499 --> 01:42:07.335
you know. to endure all
this suffering and pain?"

2516
01:42:07.377 --> 01:42:10.046
What's the purpose of my life?

2517
01:42:10.088 --> 01:42:11.715
You know. I love my kids.

2518
01:42:13.091 --> 01:42:15.343
I love my grandkids. and
to see a great-grand.

2519
01:42:15.385 --> 01:42:17.012
that is a blessing.

2520
01:42:17.053 --> 01:42:18.304
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

2521
01:42:18.346 --> 01:42:22.684
- But what is this great
calling all my life?

2522
01:42:25.562 --> 01:42:28.690
- Well. I mean. just what
you just testified about.

2523
01:42:28.732 --> 01:42:31.151
I mean. if most people. (laughs)
they couldn't even do that

2524
01:42:31.192 --> 01:42:33.278
or talk about it if
they were in your shoes.

2525
01:42:33.319 --> 01:42:34.904
- I. I. I know
I've made mistakes.

2526
01:42:34.946 --> 01:42:39.576
but. (sniffs) and if God has
this plan for me. Ms. White.

2527
01:42:39.617 --> 01:42:42.454
then why did he allow
my mind to go to a place

2528
01:42:42.495 --> 01:42:45.665
that wanted to end a
life just for someone

2529
01:42:45.707 --> 01:42:47.083
that I really loved?

2530
01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:49.836
- Listen. now I understand
what you're saying.

2531
01:42:49.878 --> 01:42:52.297
but hurt people hurt people.

2532
01:42:52.339 --> 01:42:54.299
And how could you love him

2533
01:42:54.341 --> 01:42:57.344
when you didn't even
know what real love was?

2534
01:42:57.385 --> 01:43:00.055
- I thought I had
it with Antares.

2535
01:43:00.096 --> 01:43:03.058
You know. I really
thought he loved me.

2536
01:43:03.099 --> 01:43:04.893
but I guess I couldn't
give him what he needed.

2537
01:43:06.353 --> 01:43:09.356
- You gave him
everything he needed.

2538
01:43:09.397 --> 01:43:12.025
He just didn't understand
the true woman of God

2539
01:43:12.067 --> 01:43:14.486
that you were to bless him.

2540
01:43:14.527 --> 01:43:15.904
Listen. I know.
(gentle music)

2541
01:43:15.945 --> 01:43:18.198
and I really believe the
reason you were uncomfortable

2542
01:43:18.239 --> 01:43:20.158
in your marriage
Antares Noble is

2543
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.243
because he made it seem
like the sexual activities

2544
01:43:22.285 --> 01:43:23.995
in your bedroom was a bad thing.

2545
01:43:25.038 --> 01:43:26.748
- You know. in a
way. Ms. Celeste.

2546
01:43:27.832 --> 01:43:30.377
I would do anything. and I
was willing to do anything

2547
01:43:30.418 --> 01:43:35.090
to please my husband. except
for when I felt rejected.

2548
01:43:35.131 --> 01:43:37.050
when I knew he was
cheating on me.

2549
01:43:37.092 --> 01:43:39.010
He had all that infidelity.

2550
01:43:39.052 --> 01:43:44.891
- That's understandable. but
what about you being pleased?

2551
01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:46.226
- What do you mean?

2552
01:43:46.267 --> 01:43:48.061
- I believe you weren't
truly healed from your past.

2553
01:43:48.103 --> 01:43:50.730
because you were hindered
because of trust.

2554
01:43:50.772 --> 01:43:55.694
I mean. belief. forgiveness.
understanding. compassion.

2555
01:43:57.237 --> 01:43:58.571
And no matter who you were with.

2556
01:43:58.613 --> 01:44:00.240
you woulda still felt
like you were raped

2557
01:44:00.281 --> 01:44:02.909
because you didn't have
a relationship with God.

2558
01:44:02.951 --> 01:44:06.329
- Relationship with God. so
what do you mean. Ms. White?

2559
01:44:06.371 --> 01:44:08.540
Are you saying I should
have had sex with God?

2560
01:44:08.581 --> 01:44:11.543
- No. no. Mahogany. I'm not
saying I have sex with God.

2561
01:44:11.584 --> 01:44:14.546
but what I'm saying is you can
have a relationship with God

2562
01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:18.466
to show you how to be
loved. how to receive love.

2563
01:44:18.508 --> 01:44:20.301
and also how to give love.

2564
01:44:21.344 --> 01:44:23.221
- I thought I had
that with Antares.

2565
01:44:23.263 --> 01:44:24.973
I really thought he loved me.

2566
01:44:26.182 --> 01:44:29.519
but I. I just. I. I wouldn't.
I wouldn't even know

2567
01:44:29.561 --> 01:44:31.479
where to start. you know.

2568
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:36.359
I. every time I try
to get close to God.

2569
01:44:37.485 --> 01:44:41.865
it seem like I gotta endure
more pain. more suffering.

2570
01:44:41.906 --> 01:44:43.825
- He has a great
calling on your life.

2571
01:44:44.909 --> 01:44:47.328
and Matthew 5:10 says that
we are his blessed children

2572
01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:52.250
and that they reveal you
and persecute you falsely

2573
01:44:52.292 --> 01:44:55.670
for his namesake. and you
are his chosen vessel.

2574
01:44:57.464 --> 01:45:02.594
- You know. my grandmother.
she used to say I was special.

2575
01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:05.722
Watch what you entertain.

2576
01:45:07.515 --> 01:45:09.184
that there was this
great calling on my life.

2577
01:45:09.225 --> 01:45:10.393
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

2578
01:45:12.312 --> 01:45:13.563
(Mahogany sniffs)

2579
01:45:13.605 --> 01:45:16.816
- But I would always search
for the love in others

2580
01:45:16.858 --> 01:45:19.861
because I didn't experience
that with my family.

2581
01:45:19.903 --> 01:45:23.615
- Okay. well. Mahogany.
have you forgiven yourself?

2582
01:45:25.825 --> 01:45:26.618
- I don't know.

2583
01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:30.038
The reason I say
this. Ms. White. is

2584
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.500
because every event that
I have been going through.

2585
01:45:33.541 --> 01:45:35.835
I blame myself.
(sniffs) you know.

2586
01:45:35.877 --> 01:45:39.297
for not being smart
enough. not knowing enough.

2587
01:45:39.339 --> 01:45:41.174
not. not seeing enough.
not caring enough.

2588
01:45:41.216 --> 01:45:44.344
you know. not
being aware enough.

2589
01:45:44.386 --> 01:45:45.637
(sobbing) I-
- Well. Mahogany.

2590
01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:50.266
but what about loving
yourself enough to let go?

2591
01:45:50.308 --> 01:45:53.395
I mean. I've sit here
with you for two hours.

2592
01:45:53.436 --> 01:45:55.397
and I feel like you're
holding yourself captive

2593
01:45:55.438 --> 01:45:56.856
in your own prison.

2594
01:45:56.898 --> 01:45:58.817
Like. you're not
forgiving yourself.

2595
01:45:59.859 --> 01:46:03.363
- Ms. White. I want. I
wanna forgive myself.

2596
01:46:03.405 --> 01:46:04.322
(Mahogany sniffs)

2597
01:46:04.364 --> 01:46:05.573
I just don't know how to.

2598
01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.201
- Here you go. baby.

2599
01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:10.036
- (sobbing) Thank you.

2600
01:46:10.078 --> 01:46:11.454
(sniffs) I don't know how.

2601
01:46:11.496 --> 01:46:16.001
You know. I ask God.

2602
01:46:16.042 --> 01:46:19.671
I say. "Why?

2603
01:46:19.713 --> 01:46:21.339
What's. what's this great
calling on my life?"

2604
01:46:21.381 --> 01:46:23.466
You know. "Save me.

2605
01:46:23.508 --> 01:46:25.260
Deliver me."

2606
01:46:25.301 --> 01:46:28.388
(Mahogany sobbing)

2607
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:32.017
I don't wanna be alone
in this life. (sobbing)

2608
01:46:35.895 --> 01:46:38.815
you know. because in
God's word. he says

2609
01:46:38.857 --> 01:46:40.525
that we deserve
somebody special.

2610
01:46:40.567 --> 01:46:42.193
That's what it's
saying in his word.

2611
01:46:42.235 --> 01:46:43.153
- Mm-hmm.

2612
01:46:43.194 --> 01:46:45.739
It says in John 3:16.

2613
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:49.617
"For God so loved the world
that he gave his only son."

2614
01:46:49.659 --> 01:46:51.661
and that whoever believe
in him should now.

2615
01:46:51.703 --> 01:46:56.166
shall not perish and
have everlasting life.

2616
01:46:56.207 --> 01:46:57.167
- Oh. God.

2617
01:46:57.208 --> 01:46:58.585
(dramatic music continues)

2618
01:46:58.626 --> 01:47:00.920
Then. if that's true.

2619
01:47:00.962 --> 01:47:03.757
then when is my eternal
life gonna happen. huh.

2620
01:47:03.798 --> 01:47:05.967
when I'm not here
anymore. when I'm dead?

2621
01:47:06.009 --> 01:47:07.552
- Mahogany. are
you ready to let go

2622
01:47:07.594 --> 01:47:10.013
and let God heal you totally?

2623
01:47:10.055 --> 01:47:12.766
- Yes. I've been ready.

2624
01:47:12.807 --> 01:47:15.268
- Well. then it's time for
you to tell your truth.

2625
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:17.145
I mean. I do believe
you about the abuse.

2626
01:47:17.187 --> 01:47:21.441
I mean. emotionally. and.
and physically. and mentally.

2627
01:47:21.483 --> 01:47:23.610
But violence has
silenced your tongue.

2628
01:47:23.651 --> 01:47:26.780
It's time to give all
the bad men back to God.

2629
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.239
- Bad men.

2630
01:47:28.281 --> 01:47:29.866
I'm not with anyone. Ms. White.

2631
01:47:31.326 --> 01:47:32.160
- [Celeste] Yes. you are.

2632
01:47:32.202 --> 01:47:33.620
(Mahogany scoffs)

2633
01:47:33.661 --> 01:47:35.455
You. you sleep with 'em at
night. and you wake up with 'em.

2634
01:47:35.497 --> 01:47:36.873
(Mahogany scoffs)

2635
01:47:36.915 --> 01:47:39.209
- I don't mean to be
disrespectful. Ms. White.

2636
01:47:40.418 --> 01:47:41.961
but since you seem
to know my bedroom.

2637
01:47:42.003 --> 01:47:43.630
you're gonna have to tell
me the names of these men

2638
01:47:43.672 --> 01:47:45.006
because I am lost.

2639
01:47:45.048 --> 01:47:46.424
Okay. force-

2640
01:47:46.466 --> 01:47:49.969
- Force?
- Obligation. denial.

2641
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:52.263
fear. shame.

2642
01:47:52.305 --> 01:47:53.556
- Oh. God.

2643
01:47:53.598 --> 01:47:56.309
- And as soon as you let
these things go. Mahogany.

2644
01:47:56.351 --> 01:47:58.311
then you will be healed.

2645
01:47:58.353 --> 01:48:00.855
- God. oh. my God. thank you.

2646
01:48:02.023 --> 01:48:03.274
- [Celeste] Come here.

2647
01:48:03.316 --> 01:48:04.859
- Thank you. Ms.
White. thank you.

2648
01:48:04.901 --> 01:48:05.652
- Oh. mm.

2649
01:48:06.528 --> 01:48:07.487
(Mahogany sobs)

2650
01:48:07.529 --> 01:48:09.030
It's okay to let it go.

2651
01:48:09.072 --> 01:48:10.365
- Oh. God. (sobbing)

2652
01:48:10.407 --> 01:48:12.617
When you was naming
'em one by one.

2653
01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:14.577
I was feeling 'em
falling off of me.

2654
01:48:14.619 --> 01:48:16.287
you know. just shedding.

2655
01:48:16.329 --> 01:48:17.205
- Mm-hmm.

2656
01:48:17.247 --> 01:48:19.332
- And I know what I gotta do.

2657
01:48:19.374 --> 01:48:20.667
(dramatic music continues)

2658
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:23.962
I just gotta stop having a
pity party for myself and-

2659
01:48:24.004 --> 01:48:25.130
- Yes.

2660
01:48:25.171 --> 01:48:26.339
- and shake the devil off.

2661
01:48:26.381 --> 01:48:27.549
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

2662
01:48:28.258 --> 01:48:29.509
- Oh. my God.

2663
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:31.970
You know. what a
mighty God we serve.

2664
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:35.306
Oh. Ms. White.
thank you so much.

2665
01:48:35.348 --> 01:48:37.475
My grandmother
used to always say.

2666
01:48:37.517 --> 01:48:39.978
"To much is given
much is required."

2667
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.522
- Mm-hmm. I'd like
to sponsor you.

2668
01:48:42.564 --> 01:48:43.732
- [Mahogany] Really?

2669
01:48:43.773 --> 01:48:45.400
- And I'd like to have
your book published.

2670
01:48:45.442 --> 01:48:47.610
I have a guy down at B.R. Films.

2671
01:48:48.403 --> 01:48:49.279
- What's his name?

2672
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.697
- Marquand Ragland.

2673
01:48:50.739 --> 01:48:53.992
You may know him. but. um.
he would love to make a movie

2674
01:48:54.034 --> 01:48:56.077
outta your true
life story. mm-hmm.

2675
01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:58.872
- Thank you.

2676
01:48:58.913 --> 01:49:02.083
Uh. thank you. I mean. I don't
know what to say. you know?

2677
01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:03.335
Thank you.

2678
01:49:03.376 --> 01:49:04.502
- I mean. you can tell
me the title you want

2679
01:49:04.544 --> 01:49:06.254
for your book and your movie.

2680
01:49:08.423 --> 01:49:10.008
- "You Got Me Twisted!"

2681
01:49:11.551 --> 01:49:13.011
- Okay.

2682
01:49:13.053 --> 01:49:14.471
- That's the one.
- I like it.

2683
01:49:14.512 --> 01:49:16.181
How did you. how did you
come up with that title?

2684
01:49:16.222 --> 01:49:17.515
(Mahogany sighs)

2685
01:49:17.557 --> 01:49:21.603
- Well. I need every
queen and king to know

2686
01:49:23.188 --> 01:49:25.565
that we serve a mighty God.

2687
01:49:25.607 --> 01:49:27.108
- [Celeste] Yeah. we do.

2688
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:32.655
- But the devil. he's real.
and he comes to seek. kill.

2689
01:49:32.697 --> 01:49:34.449
and to try to
destroy your destiny.

2690
01:49:34.491 --> 01:49:35.742
- [Celeste] Mm-hmm.

2691
01:49:35.784 --> 01:49:38.703
- But to know that
no weapon formed

2692
01:49:38.745 --> 01:49:41.164
against you shall prosper.

2693
01:49:42.457 --> 01:49:43.541
You know why?

2694
01:49:43.583 --> 01:49:46.002
Because we belong to
the most high god.

2695
01:49:46.044 --> 01:49:48.546
And when the devil
come to your face.

2696
01:49:48.588 --> 01:49:51.174
you just gotta look him
dead in the face and say.

2697
01:49:51.216 --> 01:49:53.468
"You got me twisted. boo.

2698
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:55.595
I belong to the most high God."

2699
01:49:55.637 --> 01:49:56.513
(dramatic music)

2700
01:49:56.554 --> 01:49:58.264
* I'll take my crown now

2701
01:49:58.306 --> 01:50:02.519
* These voices in my head.
I'm telling you to bow down

2702
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.147
* You don't got control.
no. so bow down

2703
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:12.195
* I don't give you control.
no. so bow down. yeah

2704
01:50:12.237 --> 01:50:13.863
* I'll take my crown now

2705
01:50:13.905 --> 01:50:17.909
* These voices in my head.
I'm telling you to bow down

2706
01:50:17.951 --> 01:50:21.371
* You don't got
control. so bow down

2707
01:50:21.413 --> 01:50:26.710
* I don't give you control.
no. so bow down. yeah

2708
01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.005
* Bow down

2709
01:50:30.046 --> 01:50:33.133
* You gotta tell 'em. you
gotta tell 'em to bow down

2710
01:50:33.174 --> 01:50:34.592
* If they don't match
up with the word

2711
01:50:34.634 --> 01:50:36.886
* Then. you gotta
tell 'em to bow down

2712
01:50:36.928 --> 01:50:41.307
* You gotta crown out. you
gotta tell 'em to bow down

2713
01:50:41.349 --> 01:50:43.977
* Yeah. yeah. yeah

2714
01:50:44.019 --> 01:50:46.229
* Voices in my head telling
me that I won't make it

2715
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:47.981
* But I like a challenge

2716
01:50:48.023 --> 01:50:49.858
* So. I just keep going.
trust in the Lord

2717
01:50:49.899 --> 01:50:51.860
* The more that I know.
the more that I grow

2718
01:50:51.901 --> 01:50:53.486
* The more that I
show the devil

2719
01:50:53.528 --> 01:50:57.365
* That he's on the
bottom of my soul

2720
01:50:57.407 --> 01:50:59.701
* Yeah. he's on the bottom of

2721
01:50:59.743 --> 01:51:04.080
* I know. life comes.
and life goes
