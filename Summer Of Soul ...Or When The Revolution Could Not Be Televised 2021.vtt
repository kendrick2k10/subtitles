00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:52.428
His assassination was the result

BLAND‐ACOSTA: There was protests

Then there was the Vietnam War.

AL SHARPTON: By '69.
the Black community was divided

204
00:11:55.847 --> 00:11:58.018
between those that were
advocating non‐violence...

205
00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.651
I'd rather quit talking about revolution
and talk about what is possible.

206
00:12:01.859 --> 00:12:04.322
I was with the non‐violent crowd
'cause I was a boy preacher

207

even though I was 14.

208

self‐defense and/or worse.

in more than 100 cities.
violence broke out.

214

Several thousand looters

sacked Harlem streets
for nearly seven hours.

216
00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:29.038
the worst outbreak of looting
in that area's history.

217
00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:33.965
I knew New York was trying not to have
a repeat of that in '69.

ALLEN ZERKIN: I was introduced
to Tony Lawrence.

276
00:16:24.926 --> 00:16:26.722
when the Parks Department was tasked

277
00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:32.441
with supporting this guy.
Tony Lawrence's initiative

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:35.488
to hold something called
the Harlem Cultural Festival.

279
00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:37.702
And I was Tony's assistant.

280
00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:41.877
He was an ebullient guy.
he had this phenomenal smile.

281
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.379
MARGOT EDMAN: I remember Tony

282
00:16:43.463 --> 00:16:45.885
being physically always on the move.

283
00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:47.722
Being very positive.

284
00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:49.893
never getting angry about things

285
00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:51.229
but never sitting still.

286
00:16:51.354 --> 00:16:54.401
ZERKIN: He was a lounge singer.
and he was a promoter.

287
00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:55.529
Can you hear me in the back?

288
00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:56.698

Soul time!

293
00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:17.281
ZERKIN: Tony was a hustler
in the best sense.

294
00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:20.120
He would make a promise
about delivering something

295
00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:22.709
and then leverage that

296
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.255
to be able to get other people
to wanna participate.

297
00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:28.428
It's all premised on half commitments

298
00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:31.518
that are dependent on another.
and it all...

299
00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:34.064
ultimately. if you're persistent.
you pull it all together.

300
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:36.444
EDMAN: He knew how to schmooze
with politicians

301
00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:40.452
and he knew how to talk to
entertainers and musicians.

302
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.667
ZERKIN: Tony talked a big game.
and he delivered.

303
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:46.213
The '69 festival was huge.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

305
00:17:51.265 --> 00:17:54.438
The challenges of staging
something like that are enormous.

306
00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.192
To build a good stage.

307
00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.279
to have a decent sound system.

308
00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:02.079
that can cover 30 or 40.000
people in the park.

309
00:18:02.245 --> 00:18:06.295
you've got six consecutive
weekends of major artists.

310
00:18:06.462 --> 00:18:07.674
But in that era.

311
00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:09.928
artists and particularly artist managers

312
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:11.556
and booking agents.

313
00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:13.894
none of them
were the least bit interested

314
00:18:13.977 --> 00:18:15.523
in these kinds of events.

315
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.570
They were risky because they were afraid
they wouldn't get paid

316
00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:20.281
because who's Tony Lawrence?

317
00:18:20.991 --> 00:18:23.664
I would think the biggest challenge
was convincing them

318
00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:25.333
that this is A. legit.

319
00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:26.962
B. it's secure. you'll get paid.

320
00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:29.007
Yes. the city is really doing it.

321
00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:31.387
Yes. there'll be security. You'll be safe.

322
00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:32.932
BULLWHIP: It was our understanding

323
00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:35.437
that the police was not gonna do security

324
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:37.441
for the Harlem Cultural Festival.

325
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.407
So. the Black Panthers were there on point
to be doing security.

326
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.750
My job was to make sure
that the backstage was covered.

327
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.129
We had some members
dressed in regular clothing

328
00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:50.467
and some members in uniform.

329
00:18:50.634 --> 00:18:52.429
Eventually. the police. they were there.

330
00:18:52.513 --> 00:18:55.226
but we wasn't gonna take any chances.

331
00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.607
LEEDS: Really.
the biggest challenge was just

332
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.236
having enough cash to do it right.

333
00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:03.284
But not only did Tony
get the city behind it.

334
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:05.163
Maxwell House put up
a bunch of money.

335
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.625
LAWRENCE: The Harlem Cultural Festival

336
00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:09.296

NARRATOR: Man found it first
in the humid highlands of Kenya

338
00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:15.225
and in the misty plateaus of Abyssinia.

339
00:19:15.308 --> 00:19:17.187
a little brown bean.

340
00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:19.734
And at the heart of
Instant Maxwell House.

341
00:19:19.818 --> 00:19:21.613
is the little brown bean

342
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:27.290
from the rich. moist soil
on the misty slopes of Africa.

343
00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:28.836
HAL TULCHIN:
General Foods called me up

344
00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:30.673
to do a television special.

345
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.137
We knew we cannot let this enormous

346
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:36.560
array of talent not be taped.

347
00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:38.396
We must record them.

348
00:19:38.522 --> 00:19:41.443
There was no budget. no money. no lights.

349
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:47.372
So. the stage had to face west

ZERKIN: This was
a high‐visibility undertaking

351
00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:52.758
and would be an embarrassment
if it didn't work.

352
00:19:57.727 --> 00:20:01.568
Yeah. so Tony had to have had
somebody who vouched for him.

353
00:20:01.776 --> 00:20:07.162
At this time. we would like to
introduce a young man

354
00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:12.047
who is leading one of the greatest fights
in the world for our people.

SHARPTON: John Lindsay
was the Republican mayor in New York.

360
00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:30.709
but a liberal Republican.

361
00:20:30.918 --> 00:20:32.922
Tall. lanky. charismatic.

362
00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:35.176
He was popular among Blacks.

363
00:20:35.343 --> 00:20:38.934
He seemed to not be
in any way uncomfortable

364
00:20:39.017 --> 00:20:40.395
around Black people.

the Black community frequently

367
00:20:53.254 --> 00:20:55.968
and advocate anti‐poverty programs.

368
00:20:56.135 --> 00:20:59.307

for us 16‐year‐olds to get our first jobs.

369
00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:01.145
He just was so chill.

370
00:21:01.311 --> 00:21:03.608
Lindsay was a hellified mayor.

371
00:21:03.817 --> 00:21:06.405
When we had the riots
when they killed King.

372
00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:08.744
he was there in it
right out in the street.

373
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.459
The community of Harlem wants to be safe.

374
00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:14.714

Lindsay ran for re‐election.

You're a bum. Lindsay!
I'll say it to your face.

377
00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:28.742
He energized the Blacks

walking around the park.

398
00:22:20.386 --> 00:22:25.104
And as far as I could see.
it was just Black people.

399
00:22:25.939 --> 00:22:30.616
This was the first time
I'd ever seen so many of us.

400
00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:33.705
It was incredible.

401
00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:40.510
Families. fathers. mothers.
kids running around.

402
00:22:40.677 --> 00:22:42.765
I was one of those kids.

403

404
00:22:47.942 --> 00:22:51.323
It was like seeing royalty.

405
00:22:52.492 --> 00:22:55.749
Around the park.
people were selling food.

406
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.293
Mom was cookin'.

407
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.634

sellin' headbands.
sweatbands and balloons.

410
00:23:08.984 --> 00:23:11.196
I remember that distinctly.

411
00:23:13.075 --> 00:23:15.956
It smelled like Afro Sheen and chicken.

412

Growing up in Harlem.
if you went to places like that.

413
00:23:18.503 --> 00:23:19.588
even went to the movies.

414
00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:22.928
Mom fried some chicken.
she'd put it in foil

415
00:23:23.012 --> 00:23:25.016
and you took it with you.

416
00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:27.646

the Vaseline for the knees.

they were waitin' in lines.
tryin' to get in

I offered him some money.

00:28:06.704 --> 00:28:09.041
I said. "What. then?
What show have you got?"

525
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:13.509
You know. he said he was
one of the producers of Hair.

526
00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:15.805
‐(LAUGHS)
‐Can you believe that?

527
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:20.188
And we got in that day
and we heard Aquarius.

528
00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:22.318
Blew us out of our chairs.

529
00:28:22.484 --> 00:28:24.615
McCOO: During the intermission.
we got together and said.

530
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:27.787
"We have to record that song.
It's a hit. it's a hit."

531
00:28:27.954 --> 00:28:30.000
So we called Bones Howe. our producer.

532
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:33.633
and he said. "I've got an idea.
We'll take Aquarius

533
00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:37.056
"and we'll put it together
with Let The Sunshine In."

534
00:28:37.222 --> 00:28:41.815
(SINGING) Aquarius

535
00:28:43.694 --> 00:28:46.700
DAVIS JR.: That was
the biggest record of 1969.

536
00:28:52.962 --> 00:28:56.219
Let the sunshine

537
00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:59.392
Let the sunshine in

538
00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:03.609
The sunshine in

539
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:06.782
Let the sunshine

540
00:29:06.949 --> 00:29:10.497
‐Let it shine. come on
‐Let the sunshine in

541
00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:13.378
The sunshine in

542
00:29:13.546 --> 00:29:17.136
‐Sing along
‐Let the sunshine

543
00:29:17.637 --> 00:29:20.518
‐Let it shine
‐Let the sunshine in

544
00:29:20.685 --> 00:29:23.607
‐Open up your heart
‐The sunshine in

545
00:29:23.774 --> 00:29:25.611
When you feel like you've been mistreated

546
00:29:25.695 --> 00:29:27.281
Let the sunshine

547
00:29:27.489 --> 00:29:29.619
McCOO: Billy laid all those
wonderful gospel licks

548
00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:31.372
in his ad libs.

549
00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.629
Our producer said.
"Okay. Billy. take it to church."

550
00:29:34.796 --> 00:29:37.426
‐Yeah.
‐And Billy knew exactly what to do

551
00:29:37.594 --> 00:29:39.639
because Billy sang gospel
in his teen years.

552
00:29:39.806 --> 00:29:43.773
You know. the 5th Dimension.
we travel all over the world

553
00:29:43.939 --> 00:29:46.945
and our main purpose for travelin'

554
00:29:47.112 --> 00:29:50.745
is just to bring and spread a little love.

555
00:29:50.912 --> 00:29:53.959
Ain't nothing wrong with that. is there?
Talk to me!

556
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.088
McCOO: We were constantly being attacked

557
00:29:56.255 --> 00:29:58.343
because we weren't
quote‐unquote "Black enough."

558
00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:02.309
Sometimes we were called
"the Black group with the white sound."

559
00:30:02.476 --> 00:30:03.771
We didn't like that.

560
00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:05.817
We happened to be artists who are Black

561
00:30:05.983 --> 00:30:09.114
and our voices sound the way they sound.
And how do you color...

562
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.492
That used to be one of our questions.

563
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.664
How do you color a sound?

564
00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:16.755
That was one of the reasons
why performing in Harlem

565
00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:19.678
‐was so important to us...
‐DAVIS JR.: Mmm‐hmm.

566
00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:21.640
...because we wanted our people

567
00:30:21.723 --> 00:30:23.519
‐to know what we were about.
‐Mmm‐hmm.

568
00:30:23.686 --> 00:30:26.525
And we were hoping
that they would receive us.

569
00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.988
(SINGING) Come on and let

570
00:30:31.117 --> 00:30:33.288
Let it shine

571
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:36.210
(VOCALIZING)

572
00:30:36.587 --> 00:30:38.966
Hey! Come on and let

‐We were so happy to be there.
‐Yeah.

575
00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:47.567
(CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING)

576
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.839
I didn't want to leave.
I didn't want to leave her.

577
00:30:58.964 --> 00:31:02.847
(LAUGHING)
Let's just be clear.

578
00:31:05.268 --> 00:31:08.232
DAVIS JR.: After the show.
these kids came backstage.

579
00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:10.571
and it was so unexpected.

580
00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:12.407
It was my cousins.

581
00:31:12.575 --> 00:31:16.082
It was Ruth. Sheryl. and Maurice.

582
00:31:16.248 --> 00:31:18.671
And I'm saying to them.
"What are you guys doin' here?"

583
00:31:18.837 --> 00:31:23.304
And they said. "Well. we're singin'
with the Edwin Hawkins Singers."

584
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:24.975
Which was on the festival

585
00:31:25.058 --> 00:31:26.310
‐that year.
‐McCOO: That day.

586
00:31:26.477 --> 00:31:28.398
DAVIS JR.: And Edwin Hawkins was hot.

587
00:31:28.565 --> 00:31:29.901
‐McCOO: Oh Happy Day.
‐Oh Happy Day.

588
00:31:29.985 --> 00:31:31.445
Everybody was singin' that.

00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:08.227
‐To watch. fight. and pray
‐Oh. oh. yeah

Fight and pray

‐Oh happy day. ooh. yeah

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:22.422

‐Can I get to heaven. my Lord?
‐Oh happy day

605
00:32:29.813 --> 00:32:31.525
I'm gonna spread the news. yeah

606
00:32:31.608 --> 00:32:33.319
Oh happy day

607
00:32:33.486 --> 00:32:34.697
People tell me that the streets

608
00:32:35.031 --> 00:32:36.952
It's amazing.

609
00:32:37.202 --> 00:32:38.329
Streets are paved with gold. yeah

610
00:32:38.412 --> 00:32:39.498
Oh happy day

611
00:32:39.582 --> 00:32:41.418
KRYOR: Looking at all the people
on the stage.

612
00:32:41.503 --> 00:32:44.424
My first reaction was. "My God."

613
00:32:44.592 --> 00:32:46.596
DOROTHY: (SINGING) They tell me
you got that in heaven. my Lord

614
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.974
CHORUS: Oh happy day

615
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:49.351
They tell me you got that
in heaven. my Lord

616
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:51.982
KRYOR: The Edwin Hawkins Singers
were from all over the Bay Area.

617
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:54.863
San Francisco. Oakland. Berkeley area.

618
00:32:55.155 --> 00:32:57.284
Edwin was minister of music at our church.

619
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.204
the Ephesian Church of God in Christ.

620
00:32:59.371 --> 00:33:01.793
Walter Hawkins is Edwin's baby brother.

621
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.212
Both of those guys.

622
00:33:03.296 --> 00:33:05.885
very consecrated young men.
They loved the Lord.

623
00:33:06.093 --> 00:33:08.097
Edwin would put our choir on a fast.

624
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.809
We would fast and pray.

625
00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:12.607
(SINGING) I'm gonna spread
the news. yeah

626
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.193
CHORUS: Oh happy day

627
00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:15.779

‐My Lord
‐Oh happy day

629
00:33:16.948 --> 00:33:18.326
KRYOR: When Oh Happy Day
was recorded.

630
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:20.246
San Francisco DJs heard the song

631
00:33:20.413 --> 00:33:22.877
and put it on rotation
until it made it number one.

632
00:33:23.044 --> 00:33:25.256
The Ed Hawkins Singers from KDIA

633
00:33:25.465 --> 00:33:29.181
held on to the number‐one spot
for four consecutive weeks.

634
00:33:29.348 --> 00:33:30.809
INTERVIEWER:
Ed. what effect has all this

635
00:33:30.893 --> 00:33:33.982
sudden fame and fortune had
on the choir and yourself?

636
00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:35.653
It's a lot of excitement going on

637
00:33:35.736 --> 00:33:37.280
and I'm very happy about it.

638
00:33:37.447 --> 00:33:39.201
KRYOR: We started ministering in clubs

639
00:33:39.368 --> 00:33:42.249
and ministering with secular artists
on stages like Harlem.

640
00:33:42.332 --> 00:33:43.794
‐Happy day
‐Oh happy day

641
00:33:44.253 --> 00:33:47.843

642
00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.559
‐I'm so glad that he washed
‐When Jesus washed

643
00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:54.231
‐I said the Lord washed
‐When Jesus washed

644
00:33:54.398 --> 00:33:56.736
He washed all my sins away

645
00:33:56.903 --> 00:33:58.740
KRYOR: But when Oh Happy Day broke.

646
00:33:58.824 --> 00:34:00.661
the church was upset about it.

647
00:34:00.828 --> 00:34:02.707
We were part of the Pentecostal movement.

648
00:34:02.873 --> 00:34:04.919
You didn't drink. You didn't dance.

649
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:08.134
You didn't go to clubs.
so we were persecuted.

650
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:10.556
It was very humiliating. Mmm‐hmm.

651
00:34:10.806 --> 00:34:13.562
But we felt like the world
needed Oh Happy Day.

652
00:34:13.729 --> 00:34:15.649
HAWKINS: With the situation
of the world today.

653
00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:17.611
a lot of people don't believe
in God anymore.

654
00:34:17.778 --> 00:34:19.949
They don't go to church.
Especially our youth.

655
00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.619
It's really messed up. confused.

656
00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:23.205
they don't know who to turn to.
which way to go.

657
00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:24.416
so they're trying this and that

658
00:34:24.499 --> 00:34:26.086
and they're not finding satisfaction.

659
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.259
And I feel with young people
such as our group.

660
00:34:29.426 --> 00:34:31.013
instead of us trying to take
the gospel to them

661
00:34:31.096 --> 00:34:32.182
by preaching to them.

662
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:34.436
take it to them in song. maybe.

663
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.522
with contemporary sounds.

664
00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:38.027
new beats. new rhythms.
something they can understand.

665
00:34:38.194 --> 00:34:41.200
something they can feel
and express themselves in.

666
00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:43.245
We can show them that God yet lives.

667
00:34:43.412 --> 00:34:44.414
Please. oh. Lord

668
00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:47.212
‐Take me for your city
‐Oh happy day

669
00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:50.719
‐And then you fill me

670
00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:53.600

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:58.944
‐Oh. yes it was

LAWRENCE: Welcome to the gospel music day.

674
00:35:10.968 --> 00:35:14.307
Gospel folks from all over
the country are here today

All right? All right? Okay.

00:35:23.367 --> 00:35:24.871
All right. that's enough. that's enough.

680
00:35:24.954 --> 00:35:26.123
All right. that's enough.

681
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.292
Let's calm it down now.

682
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.296
Look. let's take it down a little bit.

683
00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:33.471
Direct from Chicago
to the heart of Harlem.

684
00:35:33.638 --> 00:35:37.270
Papa Staple and the Staple Singers.

686
00:35:41.236 --> 00:35:42.322
(SINGING) Sittin' around
on a mourner's bench

687
00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:43.992
I heard an old lady and an amen

688
00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.328
Come again to pray

689
00:35:45.495 --> 00:35:47.457
And she began to moan

690
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:49.545
(VOCALIZING)

691
00:35:52.551 --> 00:35:54.597
Yeah. yeah. yeah

Oh. yes. sir

693
00:35:57.435 --> 00:35:59.022
Then I went ahead and asked her

694
00:35:59.105 --> 00:36:00.651
She was Emma Sue

695
00:36:00.818 --> 00:36:02.988
Emma Sue

696
00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:09.209

706
00:36:44.279 --> 00:36:46.199
MAVIS: When I looked out into the crowd.

707
00:36:46.283 --> 00:36:49.456
I was overtaken with joy.

708
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.794
Help me. Jesus
Help me. Jesus

709
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:54.717
MAVIS: I just saw so many Black people.

710
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.136
and they were rejoicing.

711
00:36:56.303 --> 00:36:58.432
They were havin' a good time.

712
00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:00.646
and I started celebratin' with them.

713
00:37:00.854 --> 00:37:02.775
‐When Jesus helped me
‐Well. well

714
00:37:02.942 --> 00:37:04.904
‐When Jesus helped me
‐Give us time to get some

MAVIS: In 1969.
we were singin' gospel.

718
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.301
but we would be invited to folk festivals.

719
00:37:16.385 --> 00:37:18.640
jazz festivals. blues...

720
00:37:18.807 --> 00:37:20.226
I told Pops. I said.

721
00:37:20.393 --> 00:37:22.313
"Daddy. why these people invitin' us

722
00:37:22.397 --> 00:37:25.361
"to blues festivals.
but we don't sing no blues?"

723
00:37:25.529 --> 00:37:28.158
He said. "Mavis. listen to our music.

724
00:37:28.325 --> 00:37:31.708
"You will hear every kind
of music in our songs."

725
00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:34.295

Whoa. we are going to Heaven

726

MAVIS: In fact. it was years
before my sisters and I

730
00:37:45.861 --> 00:37:48.742
knew Pops was playin'
the blues on his guitar

731
00:37:48.908 --> 00:37:52.248
while we were singin' gospel.
(LAUGHING)

732
00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:55.212
We said.
"Daddy. you're playin' the blues."

733
00:37:55.379 --> 00:37:57.551
He said.
"That's the way I learned."

734
00:37:57.718 --> 00:37:59.304
YOUNG MAVIS: (SINGING)
Yeah. don't you need him now?

735
00:37:59.387 --> 00:38:00.389
Yeah

736
00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:03.103
MAVIS: Pops was born in Mississippi.

737
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.441
He came out of school in the eighth grade.

738
00:38:05.525 --> 00:38:07.696
started working at Dockery's farm.

739
00:38:07.863 --> 00:38:09.282
He didn't know music.

740
00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:11.662
but he taught himself to play guitar.

741
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:14.375
The first guitar I bought.
I paid five dollars for it.

742
00:38:14.543 --> 00:38:15.796
‐INTERVIEWER: Five dollars.
‐Five dollars.

743
00:38:15.879 --> 00:38:16.881
Where did you get the five dollars?

744
00:38:16.964 --> 00:38:18.008
Picking cotton plants.

745
00:38:18.092 --> 00:38:19.135
INTERVIEWER: Were you?
And how much

746
00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:20.304
did you make about a day?

747
00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:23.393
‐I made three dollars a week.
‐Three dollars a week?

748
00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:27.110
50 cents a day.
14 hours a day.

749
00:38:27.193 --> 00:38:28.822
It wasn't easy. It was tough.

Well. now do you feel all right now?

755
00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:40.386
MAVIS: When we first started singin'.

756
00:38:40.469 --> 00:38:42.390
people thought we were old people

757
00:38:42.558 --> 00:38:44.394
'cause we were singin' these old songs

758
00:38:44.562 --> 00:38:47.734
that Pops and his family
used to sing in Mississippi.

759
00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:49.279
‐Do you feel all right?
‐Amen

760
00:38:49.445 --> 00:38:50.447
Do you feel all right?

761
00:38:50.532 --> 00:38:52.160
GREG TATE: There's something
very specific

762
00:38:52.243 --> 00:38:53.746
about what happened in Black America

763
00:38:53.913 --> 00:38:57.336
where I think the only place
we could be fully expressive

764
00:38:57.504 --> 00:38:59.884
was in music.
was in these church rituals.

765
00:39:00.176 --> 00:39:01.469
YOUNG MAVIS: (SINGING)
Help me. Lord

766
00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:04.685
TATE: Gospel was channeling
the emotional core of Black people

767
00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:06.647
who were insiders as Christian.

768
00:39:06.814 --> 00:39:09.277
They experienced and redefined
it for themselves

769
00:39:09.444 --> 00:39:10.697
and that goes all the way back

770
00:39:10.864 --> 00:39:12.868
to the first moments. probably.

771
00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:14.663
of Black conversion to Christianity.

778
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.902
TATE: There's this notion
of spirit possession

779
00:39:29.985 --> 00:39:31.196
that comes from Africa.

780
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.747
It's a part of seeking

781
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.626
a certain kind of release and catharsis.

SHARPTON: Gospel was more than religious.

800
00:40:39.248 --> 00:40:43.215
Gospel was the therapy
for the stress and pressure

801
00:40:43.298 --> 00:40:45.052
of being Black in America.

802
00:40:45.219 --> 00:40:48.851
We didn't go to a psychiatrist.
we didn't go lay on a couch.

803
00:40:49.102 --> 00:40:51.481
we didn't know anything about therapists.

804
00:40:51.565 --> 00:40:53.110

It's deep in the recesses
of my consciousness.

812
00:41:28.723 --> 00:41:31.060
My grandfather was a minister.

813
00:41:31.227 --> 00:41:33.733
My father was a chaplain in World War II.

814
00:41:33.816 --> 00:41:34.985
the Korean War.

815
00:41:35.152 --> 00:41:37.406
That religious consciousness

816
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.703
kept him and so many others going.

817
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:44.378
During the civil rights movement.
the church provided sustenance for us.

I want us to prepare
to bow our heads in prayer.

SHARPTON: Ben Branch
was a saxophone player from Memphis.

839
00:42:56.565 --> 00:43:00.405
When Reverend Jackson started
the Operation Breadbasket rallies.

840
00:43:00.615 --> 00:43:02.451
Ben put an orchestra together.

841
00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:04.956
I was youth director
of Operation Breadbasket

842
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:08.088
and we put pressure on the private sector

843
00:43:08.171 --> 00:43:09.841
to contract Black businesses.

844
00:43:10.008 --> 00:43:11.469
give us shelf space.

845
00:43:11.553 --> 00:43:13.014
put Blacks on corporate boards.

846
00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:15.102
or we would boycott
and we would picket them.

847
00:43:15.268 --> 00:43:20.822
And so today we will throw up
around here justice pickets.

848
00:43:22.951 --> 00:43:25.497
SHARPTON: Ben Branch
was always revered

849
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:27.042
by the kids like me

850
00:43:28.587 --> 00:43:31.635

last words was to Ben.

858
00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:59.315
and sister Mahalia Jackson was my idol.

859
00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:03.114
She was my hero.
I loved her so much.

860
00:44:03.281 --> 00:44:05.828
This day. I sit right next to her

861
00:44:06.037 --> 00:44:08.626
and when came time for her to sing.

862
00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:13.092
she leaned over and told me.
"Baby. Halie don't feel too good today.

"I need you to help me sing this song."

Doctor King

MARTIN LUTHER KING:
And he's allowed me to go

877

And I've looked over

878
00:44:53.799 --> 00:44:57.180

As we walked across the courtyard.

886
00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:32.919
Doctor King came to the door
full of glee and joy.

887
00:45:34.338 --> 00:45:37.929
And then he said.
"Jesse. it's time to eat."

888
00:45:39.808 --> 00:45:43.189
He said. "Jesse. you don't
even have a tie for dinner."

889
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:48.491
And he said to Ben.

890

"You should play my favorite song.
My Precious Lord."

891
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.169

894
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.584
but he didn't die crying and die afraid.

895
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:16.923
He died asking the Lord to lead his hand.

1050
00:56:52.401 --> 00:56:53.988
KNIGHT: Now. when I stepped on stage.

1051
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:56.618
I was totally. totally taken aback

1052
00:56:56.869 --> 00:56:59.666
because I didn't expect
a crowd like that.

1053
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.252
LAWRENCE: And the Pips!

1054
00:57:01.335 --> 00:57:02.630
(CROWD CHEERING)

1055
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:06.179
(SINGING) Oh. I bet
you're wonderin' how I knew

1056
00:57:07.014 --> 00:57:08.266
Baby. baby. baby

1057
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:11.857
'Bout your plan to make me blue

1058
00:57:12.024 --> 00:57:15.363
With some other girl you knew before

1059
00:57:15.948 --> 00:57:19.455
Between the two of us girls
Ya know I love you more

1060
00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:23.798
It took me by surprise. I must say

1061
00:57:23.964 --> 00:57:25.968
When I found out yesterday

1062
00:57:26.135 --> 00:57:28.348
Don't ya know that I heard it
through the grapevine

1063
00:57:28.516 --> 00:57:30.268
Whoa. I heard it
through the grapevine

1064
00:57:30.435 --> 00:57:31.980
Not much longer would you be mine

1065
00:57:32.064 --> 00:57:33.567
THE PIPS: Not much longer
would you be mine

1066
00:57:33.651 --> 00:57:34.694
Oh. don't ya know that I heard it

1067
00:57:34.778 --> 00:57:35.780
Through the grapevine

1068
00:57:35.905 --> 00:57:37.826
Whoa. I heard it through the grapevine

1069
00:57:38.034 --> 00:57:39.830
And I'm just about. just about

1070
00:57:39.913 --> 00:57:41.415
Just about to lose my mind

1071
00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:42.544
Whoa. yes I am

1072
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:46.134
Whoa. yes I am
Whoa. yes I am

1073
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.179
Baby what you doin' to me

1074
00:57:48.681 --> 00:57:50.685
Oh. take a good look

1075
00:57:50.768 --> 00:57:52.564
At these tears in my eyes

1076
00:57:52.689 --> 00:57:57.156
Baby. baby. these tears
I can't hold on inside

1077
00:57:57.322 --> 00:58:01.164
Losin' you would end my life. you see

1078
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:04.838
Because you mean that much to me

1079
00:58:05.005 --> 00:58:08.721
You could've told me yourself

1080
00:58:08.888 --> 00:58:11.727
That you were lovin' somebody else

1081
00:58:11.894 --> 00:58:13.271
Instead I heard it through the grapevine

1082
00:58:13.438 --> 00:58:14.774
Whoa. I heard it through the grapevine

1083
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:17.237
Oh. not much longer would you be mine

1084
00:58:17.404 --> 00:58:20.745
DORINDA: Gladys Knight
was everything to us.

1085
00:58:20.912 --> 00:58:23.208
She was the queen of soul.

1086
00:58:23.374 --> 00:58:25.086
She gave it to us good.
and the Pips were workin'.

1087
00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:27.466
About to lose my mind
Whoa. yes. I am

1088
00:58:27.634 --> 00:58:31.140
Whoa. yes. I am
Whoa. yes. I am

1089
00:58:32.936 --> 00:58:34.731
(VOCALIZING)

1090
00:58:36.902 --> 00:58:38.488
I know you hear me. boy

1091
00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:41.160
KNIGHT: At that time.
we were up and coming.

1092
00:58:41.244 --> 00:58:42.789
believe it or not. (LAUGHS)

1093
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.420
I was very young.

1094
00:58:46.588 --> 00:58:48.676
Motown was like our family.

1095
00:58:48.842 --> 00:58:51.389
In the beginning. we all lived
in the same neighborhood.

1096
00:58:51.556 --> 00:58:53.519
Holland‐Dozier lived on the corner.

1097
00:58:53.602 --> 00:58:54.771
we lived right here.

1098
00:58:54.938 --> 00:58:57.150
Martha and the Vandellas
lived right there.

1099
00:58:57.317 --> 00:58:59.405
the Temptations lived right behind us.

1100
00:58:59.572 --> 00:59:01.409
We were all together.

1101
00:59:01.994 --> 00:59:04.958
Cholly Atkins was our number‐one guy.

1102
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.964
He was the one
that taught us the routines.

1103
00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:09.466
We worked. we worked...

1104
00:59:09.592 --> 00:59:13.182
we'd go in his basement
at 7:00 a. m. in the morning.

1105
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:16.272
He kept us there until five
or six o'clock in the evening

1106
00:59:16.439 --> 00:59:18.736
and if you weren't doing
his stuff right...

1107
00:59:21.783 --> 00:59:23.077
(LAUGHS)

1108
00:59:23.161 --> 00:59:27.336
He was a father to us
as well as a choreographer.

1109
00:59:28.171 --> 00:59:31.302
America had started
to listen to this music

1110
00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:34.308
and it took us
to a totally different level

1111
00:59:34.475 --> 00:59:36.855
and from there.
we went around the world.

1112
00:59:37.064 --> 00:59:38.650
(SINGING) Now bring it on down

1113
00:59:40.696 --> 00:59:44.161
Yes. I heard
Oh. yes. I did

1114
00:59:44.328 --> 00:59:47.334
Yes. I heard. oh

1115
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:48.962
You know. it's strange

1116
00:59:49.129 --> 00:59:51.425
But the same thing
happened to my three guys

1117
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.553
‐Hey. fellas
‐Hey!

1118
00:59:52.637 --> 00:59:53.680
Come on and tell 'em

1119
00:59:53.764 --> 00:59:55.141
Just how you found out about it

1120
00:59:56.477 --> 01:00:00.193
Oh. I heard through the grapevine

1121
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.700
Oh. I heard through the grapevine

1122
01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.538
And I heard. heard. heard. heard. heard it

1123
01:00:05.621 --> 01:00:06.915
Through the grapevine

1124
01:00:07.082 --> 01:00:08.585
And I heard. heard. heard. heard. heard it

1125
01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:10.380
Through the grapevine

1126
01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:16.475
Yes. I heard
Oh. yes. I did

1127
01:00:16.643 --> 01:00:17.728
Yes. I heard

1128
01:00:17.895 --> 01:00:19.649
KNIGHT: Motown was very interested

1129
01:00:19.732 --> 01:00:21.736
in us keeping our integrity.

1130
01:00:21.903 --> 01:00:24.742
Having class. being polite.

1131
01:00:27.122 --> 01:00:28.709
YOUNG KNIGHT: (SINGING)
Hey. hey. hey

1132
01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.503
I heard it through the grapevine

1133
01:00:30.671 --> 01:00:33.886
But I knew something very. very important

1134
01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:35.598
was happening in Harlem that day.

1135
01:00:35.764 --> 01:00:37.017
(SINGING) I heard it

1136
01:00:40.273 --> 01:00:42.612
It wasn't just about the music.

1137
01:00:48.957 --> 01:00:50.794
We wanted progress.

1138
01:00:53.759 --> 01:00:55.220
We are Black people.

1139
01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:57.892
and we should be proud of this.

1140
01:00:58.059 --> 01:00:59.812
And we want our people.

1141
01:00:59.896 --> 01:01:02.025
we want our people lifting us up.

(CROWD CHEERING)

1144
01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:11.043
We believed in what we felt in here.

1145
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:17.097
So. when we went out.
"Let's go! Let's go do it!"

1146
01:01:18.182 --> 01:01:20.270
(CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING)

1147
01:01:29.037 --> 01:01:30.958
TATE: At the Harlem Cultural Festival.

1148
01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:34.674
you got a audience that's
showing up who's radicalized.

1149
01:01:35.133 --> 01:01:38.849
There's just this embrace of
neo‐super Blackness.

1150
01:01:39.016 --> 01:01:40.644
That generation had evolved

1151
01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:44.527
and Black music was moving
into this rapidly changing era

1152
01:01:44.694 --> 01:01:46.573
of psychedelicized R and B.

1153
01:01:47.032 --> 01:01:49.494
Ladies and gentlemen.

1154
01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:53.377
the internationally known.

1155
01:01:53.545 --> 01:01:56.133
the dynamic...

1156
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.724

LEWIS: When you saw a Black group.

1159
01:02:02.938 --> 01:02:07.030
what you expected to see was.
generally speaking. all men.

1160
01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:09.994
all dressed in matching suits.

1161
01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:14.294
ready even before they hit
the stage to perform.

1162
01:02:14.461 --> 01:02:15.839
He introduced Sly

1163
01:02:16.006 --> 01:02:18.595
and the first thing
that happens to the audience

1164
01:02:18.762 --> 01:02:21.058
is the feeling of apprehension

1165
01:02:21.183 --> 01:02:24.022
because just because they introduced Sly

1166
01:02:24.231 --> 01:02:27.404
doesn't mean he's there. (LAUGHS)

1167
01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:31.495
It also doesn't mean
he's coming out immediately.

1168
01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:33.082
Ladies and gentlemen.

1169
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.546
we're gonna have to stop the show
if you keep on pushing.

1170
01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:37.382
We're gonna have to stop
the show right here.

(CROWD CHEERING)

1172
01:02:39.344 --> 01:02:42.058
LEWIS: So. the group
would kind of saunter out.

1173
01:02:43.352 --> 01:02:45.733
GREG ERRICO: I remember it
being a beautiful. sunny day.

1174
01:02:45.899 --> 01:02:48.154
We hit the stage late

1175
01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.784
and I remember.
"Jeez. there's a big crowd here"

1176
01:02:50.951 --> 01:02:52.412
and this was Harlem.

1177
01:02:53.122 --> 01:02:54.667
(CROWD CHEERING)

1178
01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:56.921
LEWIS: The instruments weren't tuned.

1179
01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:59.635
You're wondering. "What are they doing
with girls in the group?

1180
01:02:59.802 --> 01:03:01.931
"What is white people doing up there?"

1181
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:04.896
We started tuning up. you know. bam!

1182
01:03:05.062 --> 01:03:06.983
Hit the snare. kicks. that's good.

1183
01:03:07.192 --> 01:03:09.864
Almost like a loose tuning jam.

1184
01:03:10.031 --> 01:03:11.993
LEWIS: And a white guy is the drummer?

1185
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.830
We couldn't get this thing.

1186
01:03:13.914 --> 01:03:15.416
that the white guy is the drummer.

1187
01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:18.799
You know. he's not supposed
to be able to do that.

1188
01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:21.386
ERRICO: They came to check us out.

1189
01:03:21.554 --> 01:03:23.600
You know. "What you got?"

1190
01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.689
And probably Jerry and I were
the only two white people there.

1191
01:03:28.025 --> 01:03:31.198
As soon as everything
was kicking. it was on.

1192
01:03:31.365 --> 01:03:33.369
SLY: (SINGING)
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah

1193
01:03:33.452 --> 01:03:35.206
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah

1194
01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:37.586
I'm talkin'. talkin'. talkin'. talkin'

1195
01:03:37.753 --> 01:03:39.339
Walkin'. walkin'. walkin'. walkin'

Time is passin'. I grow older
Things are happenin' fast

1198
01:03:48.733 --> 01:03:52.282
All I have to hold on to
Is a simple song at last

1199
01:03:52.448 --> 01:03:53.450
Let me hear you say

1200
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:59.462
Ya. ya. ya. ya. ya

1201
01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:07.938
Ya. ya. ya. ya. ya

1202
01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:18.083
Sing a simple song

1203
01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:23.553
Try a little do re mi fa so la ti do

1204
01:04:42.883 --> 01:04:45.179
TATE: Sly and the Family Stone
was such a game changer

1205
01:04:45.262 --> 01:04:47.308
on so many levels.

1206
01:04:48.812 --> 01:04:51.943
They are kind of our first
two‐tone soul group.

1207
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:55.784
They were bringing gender parity
into the presentation.

1208
01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:57.871
(SINGING) Everybody sing together

1209
01:04:58.038 --> 01:05:02.005
BLAND‐ACOSTA: To see a Black woman
playin' a trumpet made me feel great.

1210
01:05:02.171 --> 01:05:07.223
(SINGING) Ya. ya. ya. ya
Sing it in the shower. ya

1211
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:09.019
TATE: Sly came up in the church.

1212
01:05:09.102 --> 01:05:10.689
so he's got all that vernacular.

1213
01:05:10.939 --> 01:05:12.358
He used to be a DJ

1214
01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.864
in the middle of the
Haight‐Ashbury revolution.

1215
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:16.659
so he's coming from the epicenter

1216
01:05:16.743 --> 01:05:17.911
of transformative cool.

1217
01:05:18.078 --> 01:05:20.959
transformative hip.
politically savvy America.

1218
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:23.882
He's a conservatory student
and a multi‐instrumentalist.

1219
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:26.554
so there's the proto‐Prince
factor going on.

1220

Sly wanted to address
everybody and everything.

1221
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.194
Music was the common denominator.

1222
01:05:34.612 --> 01:05:37.785
And music made you want
to challenge social aspects

1223
01:05:37.868 --> 01:05:39.162
that needed to be challenged.

1224
01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:41.542

"Listen. we can't let this pass up."

1237

But I could not say

1238
01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.920
that we were going to see
a concert to my mother.

1239
01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:26.507
We had to connive.

1240
01:06:26.674 --> 01:06:29.012
Maybe I told a fib.

1241
01:06:29.179 --> 01:06:31.057
I said I was going to visit my aunt.

1242

as it was happening.

1297

It was hip. you know.
It was real hip.

Harlem was a melting pot

1299

there was a new movement.

styles just suit us better.

1307
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.126
Everybody had a dashiki.
I think I had a dashiki.

1308
01:10:34.293 --> 01:10:36.464

1309
01:10:36.548 --> 01:10:37.968
of an African piece.

1310
01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.890
What we mean when we say dashiki.
is freedom.

1311
01:10:41.057 --> 01:10:43.980
So it's a freedom suit.
I can move in any direction.

Why do we think of Black

White symbolizes purity.
honesty. innocence.

I was working at The New York Times.

and I spent a lot of time in Harlem.

1657
01:27:33.204 --> 01:27:35.960
And for the first time. I wrote "Black"

1658
01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:38.423
instead of "Negro" in a story

1659
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:40.010
because I listened to the community.

1660
01:27:40.176 --> 01:27:41.262

But some white editor

1663
01:27:45.478 --> 01:27:49.988
changed my wording
from "Black" back to "Negro."

1664
01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:52.618

No. that is the message.

It's our time. it's time. do it now.

1733
01:31:17.444 --> 01:31:18.738
We want liberation.

MAX ROACH: An important step
for the Black artist to take

1736
01:31:24.917 --> 01:31:27.338
is to engage ourselves in ownership

1737
01:31:27.506 --> 01:31:30.011
of not only artistic properties.

1738
01:31:30.094 --> 01:31:31.430
but physical properties.

1739
01:31:31.598 --> 01:31:34.060
The theaters. the clubs.
the record companies.

1740
01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:36.941
RAOUL: But his record company

1741
01:31:37.025 --> 01:31:39.112
was not interested in politics.

1742
01:31:39.279 --> 01:31:41.074
It's like what they say
to the basketball players today.

1743
01:31:41.241 --> 01:31:42.703
"Just play basketball."

1744
01:31:42.786 --> 01:31:44.624
Well. they were saying.
"Just play drums."

PARRIS: I was coming
to hear Max and Abbey.

1746
01:31:51.345 --> 01:31:53.015
They were like our power couple.

1747
01:31:53.098 --> 01:31:54.476
but Black power.

I never found a home

I guess it must be written
All my life to roam

They were so beautiful.
and young and dynamic.

1752
01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:13.472
There's a land of milk and honey

1753

On the river they call the Nile

1754
01:32:17.272 --> 01:32:19.777
RAOUL: You know this phrase
"unapologetically Black"?

1755
01:32:19.944 --> 01:32:22.700
They lived that phrase every day.

1756
01:32:22.866 --> 01:32:25.496
The African woman always worked

1757
01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:27.585
to bring home the bread.

1758

I'll stop in

1763
01:32:41.613 --> 01:32:43.908
RAOUL: My dad and Abbey
just didn't see

1764
01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:47.040
the civil rights struggle
as an American thing.

1765
01:32:47.248 --> 01:32:48.793
They saw the struggles in the Caribbean

1766
01:32:49.002 --> 01:32:50.881
and South America and in Africa

1767
01:32:51.214 --> 01:32:53.302

The problems that face
Black people everywhere

1770

are essentially the same.

1771
01:32:58.688 --> 01:33:01.986
oppressed by racist institutions
created by whites.

1772
01:33:02.153 --> 01:33:04.491
You guys can use
certain kinds of support.

1773
01:33:04.659 --> 01:33:07.163
We do have to launch an armed struggle.

In Harlem.

1778
01:33:23.404 --> 01:33:26.326
we were being exposed to linkages

1779
01:33:26.493 --> 01:33:30.042
between Latinos. Blackness. Africa.

1780
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:34.092

SELEMA MASEKELA:
When my dad left South Africa.

1783
01:33:38.518 --> 01:33:40.271
it was during the height of apartheid.

1784
01:33:40.354 --> 01:33:42.233

SELEMA: He comes to America

1787
01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:54.174
and lands straight into
the hotbed of civil rights.

1788
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:02.148
At the time. Grazing in the Grass

1789
01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:04.486
was one of the biggest songs
on the planet.

1790
01:34:04.653 --> 01:34:06.783
My father realized
there was this real hunger

1791
01:34:06.949 --> 01:34:09.872
for Black Americans
to feel and see and taste

1792
01:34:09.955 --> 01:34:12.795
what it would be like to be African.

1793
01:34:21.938 --> 01:34:23.608
My father loved Harlem.

1794
01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:25.612
He always wanted to be within the people.

1795
01:34:25.946 --> 01:34:28.450
If it was poppin' off
somewhere where people were

1796
01:34:28.618 --> 01:34:31.541
disenfranchised. disempowered.
or needed support.

1797
01:34:31.707 --> 01:34:33.168
it was like a tractor beam for him.

1798
01:34:33.335 --> 01:34:36.258

HUGH MASEKELA: In general.

1801
01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.174
you'll find that musicians come from

1802
01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:58.845
the activist part of their populations.

1803
01:34:59.012 --> 01:35:02.769
and they come usually
from the poor side of town

1804
01:35:02.936 --> 01:35:06.903
or represent the opinions
of the people who are exploited.

NINA SIMONE: An artist's duty.
as far as I'm concerned.

1806
01:35:09.533 --> 01:35:11.494
is to reflect the times.

1807
01:35:11.662 --> 01:35:13.791
And at this crucial time in our lives.

1808
01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.795
when everything is so desperate.

1809
01:35:15.962 --> 01:35:18.133
when every day is a matter of survival.

1810
01:35:18.216 --> 01:35:19.344
I don't think you have a choice.

She looked like a African princess.

She would bang those piano keys.
