00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.089
Good morning. Ulysses!

4
00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.043
- Good morning. Mom.

5
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.080
Time to get up. sleepy head!

6
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.867
It's another bright day in Greatland.

7
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.003
The birthplace of love.

8
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.941
- And endless source of fun.

9
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.561
- Tuna sandwich!

10
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.195
Yes! Yes!

11
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.770
Thank you. Mom!

12
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.900
Anything for my baby!

13
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.683
Happy birthday. Ulysses!
I'm so proud of you!

14
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.870
I still remember the day I gave you birth

15
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.493
and immortality. my non
binary bundle of joy!

16
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.200
Today is a very special day.

17
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.853
You're fifteen now. So.

18
00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:10.687
- Oh no!

19
00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:15.700
Not the Dark Temple Ceremony!

20
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.020
Ulysses! Every Great
must complete the Ceremony

21
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.473
on his fifteen's birthday!

22
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.560
Where are you going. young man?

23
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.020
How many times have I told you

24
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.660
not to leave food on the table?!

25
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.854
- It's my birthday. I do what I want!

26
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.340
Ladies. gentlemen.

27
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.550
gender fluids. and
diverse living organisms!

28
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.742
My fellow Greats!

29
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.589
We are bringing you the latest

30
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:53.021
from the race to the
Greatland's Sweetheart Position!

31

Two candidates.

Jorg Doberman and Cat Purry.

33
00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:05.670
Have
been going head to head

34
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.567
soliciting your Tokens of Love.

35
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.720
Today Jörg Doberman and Cat Purry

36

37
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.600
to Ulysses and many other
great boys across Greatland!

38
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.510
Woof or Felinist. cast your Tokens of Love

39
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.477
and make your candidate win!

40
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.800
Cat Purry will build on
her career long effort

41
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.470
to advance the Proud Felinist Revolution

42
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.700
and modernize the S.L.A.V.E
Sanctuary to ensure that

43
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.690
it meets the highest
standards of love and care.

44
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.710
Here is what Jörg Doberman promises

45
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.088
to do if he's elected.

46
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.793
- Hey Jolly!

47
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.793
Patrick. what's up!

48
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.073
- Hi.

49
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.763
We're fine I guess.

50
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.333
Aren't we. love?

51
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.593
- Bro. you shouldn't look
like a total delight!

52
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.707
- Jolly and I didn't get
much sleep last night.

53
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.273
It cried non-stop.

54
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.633
Man. I don't know if I am cut out for it.

55
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.853
Being a father sucks!

56
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.040
- Listen. Patrick.

57
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.190
you're my half brother.

58
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.970
I don't want to be mean or anything.

59
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.440
but why is your baby so

60
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.403
diverse?

61
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.030
Patrick's
father was a Diverse Great.

62
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.080
Ulysses. you should be
ashamed of yourself for asking

63
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.867
such insensitive questions!

64
00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:49.450
And you. Patrick!

65
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.480
Why isn't the portrait of your
father displayed prominently

66
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.763
in your household?

67
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.943
- Wait!

68
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.170
How come Patrick gets to know
who his Dad was and I don't?

69
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.440
- Shush. you two are gonna make
the baby start crying again!

70
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.020
Ulysses. you're
late for your daily dose

71
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.941
of crazy fun!

72
00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:18.459
- You see! It's always
the same loving thing!

73
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.577
I ask you a question and
you never ever answer me!

74
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.823
- Jolly! Jolly! He's crying again!

75
00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:29.906
You really need to leave!

76
00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:37.410
Jörg Doberman!

77
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.283
Cat Purry!

78
00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:45.862
Jörg Doberman!

79
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:49.708
- Let's go champ!

80
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.880
I'm Jörg Doberman!

81
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.944
New Dawn for Greatland!

82
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:31.220
- I'm Cat Purry

83
00:06:32.337 --> 00:06:36.133
and you're voting for Doberman?! Ew!

84
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.273
How dare you!

85
00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:46.130
Born Great! Born Immortal!

86
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.363
Hail Mother! And glory to Greatland!

87
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.569
My fellow Greats.

88
00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.736
who wants to live forever?

89
00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:57.672
- Everybody. Duh!

90
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.760
Now tell me.

91
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.520
who deprived. robbed.

92
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.860
viciously and cowardly cheated the Greats

93
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.918
out of our hard-earned immortality?

94
00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:11.892
- Evil Nation! Evil Nation!

95
00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:13.571
- Evil Nation! Boo!

96
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:16.848
- Evil Nation! Evil Nation! Boo! Down

97
00:07:16.848 --> 00:07:18.228
with Evils!

98
00:07:18.228 --> 00:07:20.510
Evil! Oh yeah!

99
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.480
Now. I don't wanna die

100
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.880
but my days are numbered!

101
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.740
Soon. very soon.

102
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.740
the Virus will begin its
heinous work inside my body.

103
00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:41.640
My hair will fall out.

104
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.083
my skin will wrinkle and I will collapse!

105
00:07:46.428 --> 00:07:47.761
And so will you!

106
00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:52.020
Oh no! No!
We don't deserve it!

107
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.417
- It's unbearable! It's unfathomable!

108
00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:58.158
It's unbearable! It's unfathomable!

109
00:07:58.158 --> 00:07:59.389
- Unbearable! Unfathomable!

110
00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:02.639
- We don't deserve! I don't deserve it!

111
00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:05.826
None of you deserve it!

112
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:07.343
What is to become of us?!

113
00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:09.528
- What's the loving news?

114
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.890
I'll be right there with you. Mr. Lee!

115
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.770
- Rejoice my fellow Greats!

116
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.160
Our salvation is near.

117
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.380
The Altruists are always
coming one step closer

118
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.240
to finding a cure for the Virus.

119
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.327
- Oh! Yes! Cure!

120
00:08:39.327 --> 00:08:42.490
- The Evil Nation will
never triumph over us!

121
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.080
Because they are all hate.

122
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.923
and we are all love.

123
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.600
Support the Altruists.

124
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.280
Give freely of your Love
Tokens to help fund research

125
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.872
to find a cure for the Virus.

126
00:08:57.872 --> 00:08:58.705
- Yes!

127
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.695
- Your Tokens!

128
00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.470
By love. we live forever!

129
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.587
- By love. we live forever!

130
00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:11.080
- Thank you. thank you
my beloved fellow Greats!

131
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.310
I will make sure that these
Tokens of Love go directly

132
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.743
to Altruists to fund
their anti-Virus research!

133
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.786
- Amazing Love Store.
Stone Age tools and more!

134
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.963
- Oh. I'm sorry Mr. Lee!

135
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.510
I didn't mean to spook you!

136
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.210
But the Altruists are this close

137
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.780
to finding cure for the Virus.

138
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.183
So can I please have my Tokens of Love?

139
00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:55.920
- Get away from me! What's this?!

140
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.060
- Relax! It's "a birthday cake"!

141
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.310
I baked it for you.

142
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.960
Quick. Ulysses! Make a wish
and blow out the candles!

143
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.800
Ulysses! Don't you dare partake

144
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.180
in these Stone Age rituals!

145
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.630
This cake is made of plants and animals.

146
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.560
They are citizens of
Greatland just like you.

147
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.850
Why do you want to hurt
your fellow Greats?

148
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.983
Do you want to end up like
Mr. Lee. invisible and mute?

149
00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:21.816
- No!

150
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.330
- Don't argue with Mother. Ulysses.

151
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.600
Our hearts beat for Greatland.

152
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.700
Let's make them beat as one with Mother's.

153
00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:38.800
I'm going to throw the cake away.

154
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.823
Good girl!

155
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:12.960
Ulysses. are you listening?

156
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.840
- Yes. Mother.

157
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.890
- Then tell me why the
Optimists made Mr. Lee invisible

158
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.773
and mute?

159
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.880
Ulysses! All Greats stand for tolerance.

160
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.890
diversity and inclusiveness.

161
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.870
But Mr. Lee chose a different path.

162
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.300
What taboo did Mr. Lee break?

163
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.653
How far back into Stone
Age did he regress?

164
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.060
- Mr. Lee invaded and
contaminated the most sacred part

165
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.040
of a woman a long time ago.

166
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.370
The end.

167
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.793
And what
happened to this woman?

168
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.750
Yes. you can!

169
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.570
Yes you can!

170
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.570
Yes you can!

171
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.903
Tell me. Ulysses. I
want to hear you say it.

172
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.420
- Contamination by Mr.
Lee caused the woman

173
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.130
to suffer vomiting. bleeding
and eventual collapse

174
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.230
from unbearable pain during child rearing.

175
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.240
Because of inbreeding.

176
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.870
Mr. Lee's daughter was born so ugly

177
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.547
that she was named "Ugly Duck".

178
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.383
There. I said it.

179
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.283
Now leave me alone.

180
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.343
I'm sorry. she went on and on.

181
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.582
- She just doesn't let go. does she?

182
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.933
- Happy birthday. Ulysses!
Dad and I got you a gift.

183
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.603
Open it! Tear the paper!

184
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.780
- A book?! Are you out of your mind?

185
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.420
You want me to end up
on Repentance Island?

186
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.970
- But you love stories!

187
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.430
We'll just read it here. in
secret like we always do.

188
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.310
Remember how much fun
we had with Shakespeare

189
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.170
and Charles Perrault?

190
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.630
- Yeah. not really. I just pretended.

191
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.470
Otherwise Mr. Lee wouldn't have
given me my Tokens of Love.

192
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.420
Look. can we just paint my nails
blue like we did last year?

193
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.253
- Open it.

194
00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:41.086
- No way!

195
00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:49.850
"Just open

196
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.583
the damn book"

197
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.857
"Ody-s-sey by

198
00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:04.690
Ho-mer.

199
00:14:07.104 --> 00:14:10.890
To my son Ulysses.

200
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.650
on his 15th birthday.

201
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.685
Wishing you to be better than me."

202
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.090
My father's name was Homer?

203
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.470
- No. stupid! Homer wrote the book.

204
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.743
- Then who wrote this?

205
00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:37.927
"Your father. he gave this book to me."

206
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.653
You knew my father all these years!

207
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.137
Why didn't you tell me?!

208
00:14:53.697 --> 00:14:56.937
"Your father made me promise."

209
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.133
Where is he?

210
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.393
What's his name?

211
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.430
Ulysses! You are scheduled

212
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.563
for the Dark Temple Ceremony today.

213
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.585
- I hate you!

214
00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:19.148
I hate everything!

215
00:15:19.148 --> 00:15:19.981
- Dad!

216
00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:30.036
- Where are you. Mr. Lee?

217
00:15:30.036 --> 00:15:31.281
Show yourself!

218
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:32.281
- Dad?! Dad!

219
00:15:41.644 --> 00:15:42.477
Dad! Dad!

220
00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:47.283
Stop it you two!

221
00:15:47.283 --> 00:15:48.905
I've got the Virus!

222
00:16:00.783 --> 00:16:02.450
Ulysses. the countdown

223
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.769
to your Dark Temple
Ceremony has been initiated.

224
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.840
- Well. hello gorgeous! You're late.

225
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.630
Let me give you a "quicky."

226
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.753
By love.

227
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.350
we live forever.

228
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.093
And love is what binds you and
all our Greats to our Mother.

229
00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:38.030
It's what makes us all
brothers and sisters.

230
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.670
Mother provides food. houses and Optimism.

231
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.020
Today is the day that you
will give back to our Mother.

232
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.660
Life Force will unite you

233
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.670
and Mother together forever and forever.

234
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.523
Now. this is where your
Life Force should go.

235
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.920
The Angels will now perform
for you in the Worshiping Hall.

236
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.950
Watch their every move.

237
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.503
and Life Force will manifest itself.

238
00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:13.782
- Gotcha! Thanks!

239
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.303
- Is she collapsing?

240
00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:33.800
"She'll be okay.

241
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.030
This didn't happen.

242
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.507
Don't tell anybody."

243
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.550
Don't worry Mr. Lee.

244
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.737
I won't tell anyone.

245
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.863
- Hey there handsome!

246
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.573
You've got something for me?

247
00:20:18.077 --> 00:20:20.340
Where is your Life Force. airhead?

248
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.059
- What does it look like?

249
00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:24.253
- Look you're so cute!

250
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.560
It's a white sticky substance.
sort of like boogers.

251
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.393
- OK. gotcha!

252
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.725
- There! All yours!

253
00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:40.303
- We're not done yet. love.

254
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.923
Give me your pink one.

255
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.410
Ancient scriptures!

256
00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.943
Do you know what these mean?

257
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.163
I wish I could decipher ancient language.

258
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.030
But oh well! That's what
makes us Greats great.

259
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.790
Congratulations. you've completed
your Dark Temple Ceremony!

260
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.163
Happy Adulthood!

261
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.650
Your bundle of joy will
be issued to you shortly.

262
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.930
Congratulations. Ulysses!

263
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.570
I'm looking forward to
bringing your offspring

264
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.693
into the world and parenting
it jointly with you.

265
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.643
- Thank you Ma'am.

266
00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.207
- Dad! Dad!

267
00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.929
- What are you doing?

268
00:22:23.929 --> 00:22:24.770
Leave them alone!

269
00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:29.762
- No! No! Please. let him go!

270
00:22:29.762 --> 00:22:32.633
- Ulysses. let the Optimists do their job.

271
00:22:32.633 --> 00:22:35.730
They are here to liberate Ugly Duck.

272
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.690
- For preventing the
empowerment of his daughter.

273
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.400
the generous and loving Greats

274
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.314
have decided to put Mr.
Lee out for Resurrection.

275
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.807
- No!
- Please! Don't hurt him!

276
00:22:48.807 --> 00:22:51.832
- No! No! Mother. he
wanted to report the blood.

277
00:22:51.832 --> 00:22:55.360
I swear. He was just
waiting for me to come back!

278
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.815
Mother. please! Please!

279
00:22:57.815 --> 00:23:01.681
- He didn't do anything! Please stop!

280
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:12.563
No! No. no. no. no. no.
please. not the Pulverizer!

281
00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:15.650
Please! Please! Not the Pulverizer.

282
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.733
- Mother. please! Please!

283
00:23:22.418 --> 00:23:24.585
- Activate the Pulverizer!

284
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.960
Ulysses. what happened

285
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.793
to Mr. Lee was an act of love.

286
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.060
- How is pulverizing
someone an act of love?

287
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.020
You're too
young to understand it.

288
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.333
You need to sleep. Ulysses.

289
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.073
- Ugly Duck?

290
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.523
Ugly Duck?

291
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.463
Where is she?!

292
00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:03.340
Taking her
Sensitivity Test as I told you.

293
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.223
But as every man you're
not a terrific listener!

294
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.100
- By love. we live forever!

295
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.933
All right. ladies!

296
00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:33.200
- Hey. don't call us that! It's offensive!

297
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.110
- Shut up and be proud of who you are.

298
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.853
- Exactly! Be yourself!

299
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.440
- And today is your lucky day

300
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.020
because Greatland gives you just that!

301
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.750
All Great women can choose

302
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.593
between the Proud Felinist Revolution.

303
00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:58.093
Or the SLAVE Sanctuary.

304
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.050
And SLAVE is short for?

305
00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:13.560
- Support. love. appreciation.
victory. empowerment.

306
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.393
- Good!

307
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.977
And this will help you choose your new

308
00:27:17.977 --> 00:27:19.803
and improved Testing Stick!

309
00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:01.167
- "Dear Ulysses. I write to you."

310
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:06.123
- When that is said. what
more is left for me to say?

311
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.930
Now you are free.

312
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.420
I know too well to heap
contempt upon my head.

313
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.390
- What's she talking about?

314
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.757
- It's Pushkin. "Tatiana's letter".

315
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.920
remember we read it last winter?

316
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.283
- Oh that one! So inspiring. not.

317
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.200
- I knew it would be just as
much poetry as you could take.

318
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.483
But I feel like Tatiana right now.

319
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.920
I sit alone with none to
heed or guess what ails.

320
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.763
And now my very reason fails!

321
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.700
I don't wanna be a Felinist or a SLAVE.

322
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.103
I don't wanna take the Sensitivity Test.

323
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.213
but I have to.

324
00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.660
If I perform well at the Test.

325
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.170
the Altruists may resurrect my Dad

326
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.970
when they find a cure for the Virus.

327
00:29:07.535 --> 00:29:09.952
I just want you to know that.

328
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.943
on Earth but you my heart adores!

329
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.333
That is ordained by fate. alone.

330
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.913
It's Heaven's will: I am yours.

331
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.300
Ulysses. you are and
will always be my Knight

332
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.373
in Shining Armor.

333
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.153
- I tremble to re-read. must end!

334
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.403
Good bye forever.

335
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.457
Ugly Duck. your friend."

336
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.740
- Seriously? Delight. please!

337
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.573
- Kiss me!

338
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.593
- Gross!

339
00:30:26.737 --> 00:30:28.404
- Ah. yes. yes. yes!

340
00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.579
- Urgh. love no!

341
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.680
- I have to see Ugly Duck!

342
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.980
- Ulysses. she's not your property!

343
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.490
Your behavior is not
worthy of a Great man.

344
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.490
- I don't care! She's going
away forever. I have to see her!

345
00:30:57.468 --> 00:30:58.468
Surprise!

346
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.680
It's a boy!

347
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.000
- It's a rabbit.

348
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.040
Come on. don't
be shy! Kiss your baby!

349
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.470
I worked hard on this one.

350
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.240
How shall we name him?

351
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.980
It's got to be "Albert"!

352
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.670
Oh. please. please! Pretty please!

353
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.170
- Please tell me you're joking.

354
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.830
Look at him.
Ulysses. He's just as cute

355
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.770
and adorable as you are.

356
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.050
I thought you'd be happy.

357
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.033
- He's a rabbit.

358
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.150
My son is a loving rabbit.

359
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.440
Technically. he's also my brother.

360
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.270
I'm so glad you've
finally come to you senses!

361
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.230
Take your son in arms. Ulysses.

362
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.320
It's your role now to
keep him safe and warm.

363
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.630
Remember. true Greats are
inclusive. tolerant and diverse.

364
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.330
We don't stigmatize.

365
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:03.290
We love everybody and everything:
people. animals. plants.

366
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.630
even insects.

367
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.280
We are in love with love.

368
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.907
But most of all. we love Greatland.

369
00:32:11.974 --> 00:32:13.653
- Son of a delight! He bit me!

370
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.723
Welcome to parenthood!

371
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.253
- Well.

372
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.220
a house. a baby to take
care of. I'm all set then.

373
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.810
How about a life partner?

374
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.110
Do you have someone special at heart?

375
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.973
- Not really.

376
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.073
I'm going to take Albert to
the Priest for the blessing.

377
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.300
- Looks like it's the Felinist Revolution

378
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.829
for the three of you.

379
00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:18.278
- We gonna be sistas!

380
00:33:18.278 --> 00:33:20.957
- I knew it! I felt it!

381
00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:24.263
- I'm gonna rock the love out
of the Felinist Revolution!

382
00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:54.859
Yes! Felinists!

383
00:34:02.882 --> 00:34:06.103
- All right. this one's
going to be a SLAVE.

384
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.970
Split up and let her go!

385
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.143
It's not like she's caught
a Virus or anything.

386
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.513
Oh come on!

387
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.823
Mom. I can't see anything.
is she a SLAVE or a Felinist?

388
00:34:49.162 --> 00:34:50.812
- I can't see it! I can't see it!

389
00:34:52.953 --> 00:34:54.563
- Come out already!

390
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.510
- Wait! Don't go!

391
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.460
We still have this one left!

392
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.010
Oh. just came to my mind!

393
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.453
Do you see this nice orphan
birch tree down the street?

394
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.260
Isn't she cute?

395
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.640
So far no one had the generosity

396
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.480
to embrace the pretty birch.

397
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.290
A little birdie tells me
that this generous soul

398
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.553
might just be you.

399
00:35:26.697 --> 00:35:28.850
Are you OK. my love?

400
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.073
You should go see a healer.

401
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:38.643
- I'm fine.

402
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.403
I'm Great.

403
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.690
Never been better!

404
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.340
- It never does that.

405
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.463
Hello?

406
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.233
- My. it's really quiet here today!

407
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.800
- Today's Sensitivity Test went so wrong!

408
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.170
But I saved the day.

409
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.653
All the Girls are sorted
out and on their way.

410
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.603
- So there was this really ugly girl.

411
00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.940
Red hair. blue eyes. you
know what happened to her?

412
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.370
- Ah that girl. what a mess!

413
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.750
Her results they went on and on.

414
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.353
and in the end she was
sent to Repentance Island.

415
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.223
- Can you bless my son Albert?

416
00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:29.733
- Isn't he precious!

417
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.853
- By love. we live forever!

418
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.943
You've been blessed.

419
00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:42.720
Ah! Son of a delight! He bit me!

420
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.680
Are you OK. my love?

421
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.477
You should go see a healer.

422
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.833
- Mom?

423
00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:18.618
Hello!

424
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:21.783
Are you there?

425
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.913
Always wanted to do it.

426
00:38:39.897 --> 00:38:41.113
You see. Mom.

427
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.170
Mr. Lee taught me how
to talk to appliances.

428
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.913
That heart simulator over
there. we built it together.

429
00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.588
What do I do now. Mr. Lee?

430
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.483
Hello. world!

431
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.930
Hello. world!

432
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.630
- Guide me to Repentance Island.

433
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.503
Action not authorized.

434
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.820
- Where is Repentance Island?

435
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.130
Answer not authorized.

436
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.163
- Authorized by who?

437
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.173
Answer me. Mother-loving appliance!

438
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.660
Oh Ulysses. is
this how you repay my love?

439
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.540
How could you break my heart like this?

440
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.630
You hurt me. your Mother who loves

441
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.040
and cares so much about you!

442
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.440
- Shush! Shush! Shush. be quiet!

443
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.413
This device will
self-destroy in three. two. one.

444
00:40:06.413 --> 00:40:08.503
- Oh no! No. no! Mom. please!

445
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.160
If you're hearing this message.

446
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.050
you've successfully
destroyed your bracelet.

447
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.670
Now run.

448
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.730
The Optimists are on their way.

449
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.572
Do what your namesake in
"Odyssey" did. Follow Orion.

450
00:40:45.269 --> 00:40:49.557
Mirror.
mirror. on the wall.

451
00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:58.105
Mirror. mirror. on the wall.

452
00:40:58.105 --> 00:41:00.964
Mirror. mirror. on the wall.

453
00:41:00.964 --> 00:41:02.340
Mirror. mirror. on the wall.

454
00:41:23.722 --> 00:41:27.622
- Let the Debate about
Greatland's next Sweetheart begin!

455
00:41:28.455 --> 00:41:30.134
- Yeah. you go Jörg!

456
00:41:30.134 --> 00:41:33.907
- You shut your pie hole! Jörg
Doberman is a speciest pig!

457
00:41:33.907 --> 00:41:34.993
- He's a dog.

458
00:41:42.979 --> 00:41:45.060
- Now why are you crying?

459
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.027
- To see Cat like this.

460
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.880
she's so caring so inspiring.

461
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.750
- I'm not a cat but I wish I was.

462
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.230
It would be great to be born
as one of Cat Purry's kittens.

463
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.133
- And to know the Evil
Nation created this Virus.

464
00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:06.930
- So here I am totally not
a cat. but a proud member

465
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.827
of the "I am a CAT" gang
of totally cool people.

466
00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:11.780
- What about non-people. huh?

467
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.523
Plants. animals? Ever heard
of them. spoiled brat?

468
00:42:15.523 --> 00:42:17.480
- Yes. of course. plants and animals rock!

469
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.288
And rocks rule! Wohoo!

470
00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:22.344
- Jörg Doberman on the other hand.

471
00:42:22.344 --> 00:42:24.729
Was accused of raping
a two year old coyote!

472
00:42:24.729 --> 00:42:26.540
Why's no one talking about this?

473
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.090
- Innocent until proven guilty.

474
00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:32.803
- Stop fighting. y'all!

475
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.443
Look how far we've come.

476
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.930
There was a time when we had
to mate with the opposite sex

477
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.930
in order to procreate.

478
00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.050
- Yeah. you go Jörg!

479
00:42:45.587 --> 00:42:47.450
- But not anymore.

480
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.130
We are truly free to love whoever we want!

481
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.068
- Spoken like a true Great!

482
00:42:53.068 --> 00:42:53.901
A true Great!

483
00:42:57.197 --> 00:43:01.594
- This is Malak and I vote
Malak as Cat's next mate.

484
00:43:01.594 --> 00:43:03.320
Malak! Malak!

485
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.584
- Malak! Malak! Malak!

486
00:43:04.584 --> 00:43:07.840
- Now put your hands
together and remember:

487
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.800
The whole world should serve your needs.

488
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.297
Your opinion is the only one
that matters in Greatland!

489
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.683
- Rejoicing in the breeze.

490
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.193
Ulysses sat at the helm he steered.

491
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.713
Watching the Pleiads.
and late setting Boötes.

492
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.633
and Orion that never baths in the Ocean.

493
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.750
For this star Calypso
had bidden him to keep

494
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.787
on the left hand as he
sailed over the sea.

495
00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.493
- Ugly Duck!

496
00:44:43.403 --> 00:44:44.343
Come on!

497
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.723
Stop pretending!

498
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.417
Look. I don't have a bracelet.
Mother's not listening!

499
00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:43.372
It's not you.

500
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.983
Men are so quick to blame the gods.

501
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.393
They say that we devise their misery.

502
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.400
But they themselves. in
their depravity design grief

503
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.500
greater than the griefs that fate assigns.

504
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.716
Yeah. right!

505
00:47:24.873 --> 00:47:25.706
- Amen.

506
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.263
I know you're there.

507
00:47:43.351 --> 00:47:44.184
Come over.

508
00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:45.948
Help me.

509
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.080
- You wanna fight. huh?

510
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.333
You wanna fight?

511
00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:01.953
- And the Gods smile upon us.

512
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.110
- We're bringing you some
exciting and disturbing news.

513
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.640
Clashes broke out today between supporters

514
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.640
of Jörg Doberman and
Felinists passionarias.

515
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.680
- I am a simple Great.

516
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.630
Cat Purry sets a wrong
example for hundreds

517
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.930
of our life partners across Greatland.

518
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:32.930
Now everybody must be furry
and have kittens as babies.

519
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.223
Well. my wife is not furry.

520
00:48:38.948 --> 00:48:41.080
she is leafy.

521
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.810
Where do we fit in Cat
Purry's perfect Greatland?

522
00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.240
- You anti-felinist. speciest jerk!

523
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.480
Your Jörg Doberman is a tree hatist.

524
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.123
How does it make you feel
when your tree is cut?

525
00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:57.602
- Jolly! Jolly! Jolly my love!

526
00:48:57.602 --> 00:48:59.113
- You did it to yourself.
- Are you hurt?

527
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.240
You should be ashamed of yourself!

528
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.104
- Oh I've got your baby!

529
00:49:04.104 --> 00:49:06.143
Oops. I dropped it!

530
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.093
Not!

531
00:49:08.093 --> 00:49:09.630
- Please. please. give me my baby back!

532
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:11.780
- Tree Huggers make me lose weight!

533
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.720
- Felinist Revolution!

534
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.130
It is your time to let it all out!

535
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.103
Free yourself!

536
00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:26.910
- I'm not going for it!

537
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.557
- What? It's my camera!

538
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:36.361
- Oh well. I suppose the
heart wants what it wants.

539
00:49:37.768 --> 00:49:38.601
Sad. sad.

540
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:46.743
- This is wrong!

541
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.363
How will Altruists find
her for Resurrection?

542
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.000
- What do you know of death?

543
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.570
- More than you think!

544
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.403
I've read about it!

545
00:50:05.403 --> 00:50:06.480
In books!

546
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:11.480
- Wow! You can read! You're badass!

547
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.160
- Well. reading is nothing!

548
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.700
Counting and talking to
electronic appliances

549
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.533
is much harder.

550
00:50:19.348 --> 00:50:21.760
- What've you done to your bracelet?

551
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.053
- Why did you do that?

552
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.780
I was just starting to like you!

553
00:50:28.585 --> 00:50:29.710
- What is your name. boy?

554
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:30.543
- Nobody.

555
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.000
- Where do you think you're going?

556
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.510
You're a fugitive from Optimism.

557
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.580
They catch you. they're
going to put you out

558
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.703
for Resurrection.

559
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.883
- Wait a second.

560
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.283
This is my country.

561
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.633
Why should I leave?

562
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.443
You go!

563
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.063
- Are you hungry?

564
00:51:38.842 --> 00:51:40.360
- Now you.

565
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.657
- No! Fish is my fellow Great.

566
00:51:43.657 --> 00:51:46.437
- My God. what did they do to you!

567
00:52:02.899 --> 00:52:05.982
- You've no idea what you're missing.

568
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.763
- If I try it.

569
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.460
will it make me Evil?

570
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.293
- No!

571
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.363
Fish are true Greats.

572
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.580
The fish loves you.

573
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.430
It doesn't want you to suffer hunger.

574
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.590
By eating it. you are
helping a fellow Great

575
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.040
become an even greater Great.

576
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.700
- Yuck! Your soda's really foul!

577
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.033
Burns like a bee sting!

578
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.703
- It's whiskey. Bourbon.

579
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.543
Sorry. that's all I have.

580
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.270
- Are you an Evil spy?

581
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:08.270
What's your mission?

582
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:13.050
- I'm not Evil. I am a fellow Great.

583
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.023
- Yeah. right!

584
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:19.330
Your bracelet has gradations
and says "Swiss Made."

585
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.030
It's. like. the most Evil thing on Earth!

586
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:23.740
- It's a watch.

587
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.360
I'm a Clerk.

588
00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.820
We are guardians of continuity.

589
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.690
We make sure that Greatland
does not disappear

590
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:30.523
no matter what.

591
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.540
- Never heard of Clerks.

592
00:53:39.565 --> 00:53:40.723
Oopsies.

593
00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:44.693
my head is spinning.

594
00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:47.163
- That's the alcohol's working.

595
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.940
Doesn't it make all your
problems seem less important?

596
00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.453
- Greats don't have problems.

597
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.923
Everything bad that happens
in Greatland is of Evil doing.

598
00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.690
When Ugly Duck and I were kids.

599
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:06.850
we used to think Evils were
these huge hairy monsters.

600
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:11.040
Anyway. Mother explained to
me that Evils were like us.

601
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.600
Seriously. just like us!

602
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.870
And they were lurking amongst us.

603
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.033
doing their Evil deeds to doom us all.

604
00:54:19.011 --> 00:54:20.820
- A common enemy is the best way

605
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.143
to unite a nation behind its government.

606
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.937
- Yeah. that's what you have. right.

607
00:54:26.937 --> 00:54:28.270
in your Evildom?

608
00:54:29.859 --> 00:54:30.692
A Government!

609
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:45.083
- Don't! Stop picking your nose.

610
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.513
Stop!

611
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.043
Who's Ugly Duck?

612
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:54.843
- A girl.

613
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.463
I think I like her.

614
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.863
I like a girl.

615
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.863
- Where is she?

616
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.313
- Repentance Island.

617
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.880
I'm going to save her.

618
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.163
I'm her Knight in Shining.

619
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.630
I'm her Knight in Shining Armor.

620
00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.923
- Dear God. you found the fugitive!

621
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:32.410
- Yep. and I'm not doing your job again.

622
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.170
- It's not my job to chase after them!

623
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.540
Lady Omega told me to stay out of it.

624
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.403
She's on the edge. borderline psychotic.

625
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.253
- Fish rot from the head down.

626
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.460
You gonna have to stand up to him one day

627
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.645
or your children will be next.

628
00:56:50.645 --> 00:56:51.478
- Help me!

629
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:09.913
- Hi there!

630
00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.840
I got you some cookies and milk.

631
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.710
You used to like them.

632
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:18.543
- Where am I?

633
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.290
- Well. you're in your Dad's man cave.

634
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.373
It's not really a cave.
it's an old garage but...

635
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.767
- My Dad's man cave?!

636
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.773
You knew my Dad?

637
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.313
Is he here?

638
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.753
- Why yes. he is.

639
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.313
- Well.

640
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:57.283
where?

641
00:57:57.283 --> 00:58:00.033
Where is he. when's he coming?

642
00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:07.303
- You're looking at him.

643
00:58:15.519 --> 00:58:18.769
Well. say something. what do you think?

644
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:22.303
- No.

645
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.330
- You wanna see what I'm doing?

646
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:44.163
- No.

647
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.290
- I re-set your bracelet.

648
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.350
Your record is clean as a
whistle. You can go back

649
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:06.483
to your life as if nothing ever happened.

650
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:17.250
- You wanna get rid of me?

651
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:18.973
- No. no. no. of course not.

652
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.580
Just you don't seem to be happy here.

653
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.900
So the least I can do is
facilitate your return

654
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.733
to the mainland.

655
00:59:29.577 --> 00:59:30.577
- Did you know that.

656
00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.733
my son.

657
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.653
your grandson.

658
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.033
is a rabbit?

659
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.963
And if I go back.

660
00:59:51.315 --> 00:59:52.520
I marry a birch tree.

661
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.163
- No. no!

662
01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:02.677
- A hamster. then.

663
01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:03.510
- God no!

664
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.673
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

665
01:00:11.765 --> 01:00:12.848
I'm so sorry!

666
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.560
- Mr. Doberman. Your Excellency!

667
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.888
So honored to meet you!

668
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.803
- Sit young man.

669
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.150
It's just a dog.

670
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.983
It doesn't talk.

671
01:01:31.089 --> 01:01:31.922
Good boy!

672
01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:32.755
Get out of here.

673
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.123
You're breathtaking!

674
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.863
Exquisite!

675
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.357
I'm so glad I saw you.

676
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:46.523
- I don't understand.

677
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.920
- My little princess!

678
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.023
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

679
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:57.973
Oh baby!

680
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.543
- That's your Mom.

681
01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.080
- That's how I always imagined her.

682
01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:25.600
Do you think she'll forgive
me for breaking the bracelet?

683
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.923
- Sit down. Ulysses.

684
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:35.670
Your Mom. your real Mom was
flesh and blood like you and me.

685
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.153
- Yeah. right!

686
01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.530
- Your reaction is perfectly normal.

687
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:44.577
You've been brainwashed for fifteen years.

688
01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:47.710
- Do you mean she was a woman?

689
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.590
like the one Mr. Lee contaminated
and got Ugly Duck out of?

690
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.193
- Exactly! Well done!

691
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.443
- Wow. you must feel awful.

692
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:58.543
- No. not really.

693
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.670
I'm angry

694
01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:04.143
she disappeared leaving you with me.

695
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.943
Not note. not a word all these years.

696
01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:14.700
- That's why Stone Age procreation
is banned in Greatland.

697
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.950
It's Evil!

698
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:17.223
- She was Evil.

699
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.173
- Oh. so I'm half Evil now?

700
01:03:24.545 --> 01:03:26.430
Although that would explain a lot.

701
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.200
- Evils is not even their real name.

702
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.780
I think initially they
were called Europeans

703
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.580
or Chinese or Russians.

704
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.240
Fascinating bunch!

705
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.780
When I was young. I was sent
there to study their ways.

706
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.943
But I fell in love with Evelyn.

707
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.190
I returned with you to Greatland

708
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.483
and openly confessed my sin.

709
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:54.000
The Altruists decided to
keep me on the island.

710
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.570
You were given a bracelet
and sent to the mainland.

711
01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.820
In the meantime. Lee had
eloped with the daughter

712
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.293
of a high-ranking Altruist.

713
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.650
When she died in childbirth.

714
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.300
which tells you a lot about
the state of medicine here

715
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.930
on the island.

716
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:13.930
Lee was made invisible and mute
and sent back to Greatland.

717
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:19.060
But he promised me to educate
you and take care of you.

718
01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.053
- And that he did.

719
01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.400
He and Mother and I.

720
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.600
we were one happy family
before you showed up.

721
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.660
Mother is the best!

722
01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.660
- Ulysses. the Mother of
all Greats doesn't exist!

723
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.600
It is an automatic voice
application that runs

724
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.480
on the bracelet broadcast system.

725
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.810
- Yeah. right!

726
01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:42.120
You are just messing with me now!

727
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.130
Mother told me you would.

728
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.847
You got any other ideas
up your sleeve. "Dad"?

729
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.653
Oh. I know!

730
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.763
This is Repentance Island!

731
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:56.893
- This is Repentance Island.

732
01:05:12.046 --> 01:05:13.129
- Oh delight!

733
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.210
Oh loving delight!

734
01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:18.140
I've been blinded!

735
01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.950
- Calm down. calm.

736
01:05:21.242 --> 01:05:24.391
Repentance Island is not
what you think it is.

737
01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:25.590
- By love. we live forever!

738
01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:26.790
By love. we live forever!

739
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.203
By love. we live forever!

740
01:05:29.456 --> 01:05:31.383
- Why do I even bother? Forget it.

741
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.483
- Now you just hurt my feelings.

742
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.480
Repentance Island is like the
spookiest place in Greatland.

743
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.763
How did you end up here?

744
01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.403
- I was born here.

745
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.403
Do you want to know how Greatland works?

746
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.810
- No. not really. I'd rather
go find my friend Ugly Duck.

747
01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.870
- Well. you're not gonna
be able to rescue her

748
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.913
unless you know what you're up against.

749
01:06:18.781 --> 01:06:21.423
- All right. go ahead. enlighten me.

750
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:27.307
- This is the Mind Map of Greatland.

751
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.793
Me and Lee designed it.

752
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:34.320
The bracelet system was his invention.

753
01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.240
- Someone spoke to me right
before my bracelet blew up.

754
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.350
He said. "Follow."
- "Follow Orion."

755
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.170
- Exactly!

756
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.570
And in exactly that voice!

757
01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:43.403
Do you know who it was?

758
01:06:43.403 --> 01:06:44.510
- It was me.

759
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.793
I programed that message into
your bracelet many years ago.

760
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.400
- So if I never broke my bracelet.

761
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.800
you'd never reach out to me.

762
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.503
- I knew you would.

763
01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.593
Let's not digress.

764
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.760
The bracelets catch the
thoughts of all Greats

765
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.050
and transmit them here to
the mainframe for analysis.

766
01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:10.113
Each thought is evaluated
on a three level scale.

767
01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.900
Basic - green.

768
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.290
Slightly Above Average - yellow.

769
01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:17.343
Dangerous/Complex - red.

770
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.730
This is SLAVE Sanctuary.

771
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:25.730
The SLAVEs are refusing
to accept the authority

772
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:28.360
of the Felinists over them anymore.

773
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.087
- Wait. I thought the Felinists and

774
01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:32.030
the SLAVEs had nothing do with each other.

775
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.120
- That's what Altruists want you to think.

776
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.570
The main purpose of the Felinists

777
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.950
is to control the female SLAVEs.

778
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:43.840
Fun fact: 80% of Felinists are euthanized

779
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.323
within the first three years
of joining the program.

780
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.250
They are put out for Resurrection.

781
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.950
And that is where the
second problem originated.

782
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.690
A few years ago. instead of
euthanizing the Felinists.

783
01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:00.770
Optimists began saving them.

784
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:02.110
- Like I want to save Ugly Duck?

785
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.480
- Exactly! Felinists and Optimists

786
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.603
who had "feelings" for each
other. started to ran away.

787
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:10.973
began to pro-create:

788
01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.200
there have been at least three babies born

789
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.377
in what I call "the
separatist territories."

790
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:21.960
- Wow!

791
01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.070
- This spells the end of
the current social contract.

792
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:28.650
We must act now!

793
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:30.550
If Evils find out the true state

794
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.050
of affairs here in Greatland.

795
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:33.990
they'll wipe us out!

796
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:37.683
I have a list of measures.

797
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:42.413
- Dad. it's okay.

798
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.500
- I'm so tired.

799
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.123
I've been on my own so long.

800
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.430
I feel like I'm going crazy.

801
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.630
- You're not crazy. you
just worry too much.

802
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.660
- What do you think of my map?

803
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:06.810
- Don't worry. it's not accurate at all.

804
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.800
I've been fooling Mother for years.

805
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.610
I only told her what she wanted to hear.

806
01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:15.790
- Your bracelet always
flashed yellow or red.

807
01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:19.560
Mother's pretty accurate since
she's the only gadget around.

808
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.210
- What's a "gadget"?

809
01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:23.500
- Gadgets are communication toys.

810
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.260
Years ago. gadgets allowed
everybody to talk to everybody.

811
01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.100
But soon it became so loud
that nobody could listen

812
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.060
to anybody anymore.

813
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.770
So the Altruists decided to
get rid of all the gadgets.

814
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:37.693
leaving just one:

815
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.793
Mother.

816
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.770
- And the Greats agreed?

817
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:44.830
- They were relieved.

818
01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:48.810
By then they came to associate
happiness with a simple life.

819
01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:51.390
You'd be amazed at the
hardship people can accept

820
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:53.183
if you put a positive spin on it.

821
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:56.630
Positive Attitude Set-Up.

822
01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:00.030
that's what kept Greatland
going all these years.

823
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.200
- Look. Dad. your map is dope.

824
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.333
But I still have no idea
where to find Ugly Duck.

825
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.970
- If she's anything like her mother

826
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:16.170
or Lee when he was still
visible. she'd be a stunner.

827
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.003
- She's kinda

828
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.703
ugly beautiful.

829
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.563
- Follow me.

830
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.413
I think I know where she might be.

831
01:11:08.707 --> 01:11:10.957
- Who are all these people?

832
01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.533
- They are Altruists.

833
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:19.703
- Is that lady testing
out a Cure for the Virus?

834
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.130
- I don't think so.

835
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.213
I think she's enjoying her breakfast.

836
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.473
- Hey! Those are Tokens of
Love for the Cure research!

837
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.980
- Kiddo. there is no such
thing as a cure against death.

838
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.013
Altruists know it.

839
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:41.640
They enjoy every moment

840
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.000
of their life making
sure that you pay for it.

841
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.570
- But that's so. Evil!

842
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.740
- Exactly! This island is full of shit.

843
01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.990
Most Clerks became Altruists.

844
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:55.830
or rebelled like Lee and were sent away.

845
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:58.593
I'm pretty much the only
Clerk left standing.

846
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.410
Keep your
moronic dog away from my cat!

847
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.727
What do you want?

848
01:12:08.727 --> 01:12:10.457
The SLAVE Program!

849
01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:11.670
You
want those poor women

850
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:13.880
to stop growing wheat
and start making weapons.

851
01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.930
Out of what?

852
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.200
Thin air?

853
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.570
Greatland has many enemies.

854
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:19.960
Honey. please.

855
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.550
the rest of the world follows our model.

856
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:24.050
They love LOVE. they hate HATE.

857
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:25.170
We make sure they do.

858
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:28.363
- I don't care! Cat Purry
will win this election!

859
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.053
Oh come in. Clerk!

860
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.313
- Lady Omega. Alpha Altruist.

861
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.480
- Hello. Clerk.

862
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.010
Came to talk to my husband
about his little runaway whores?

863
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.020
Go ahead.

864
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:47.810
- No. Ma'am. Actually. I
came to draw your attention

865
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:51.180
to recent developments

866
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.533
in the Mind Map.

867
01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:56.070
- Oh very well. Clerk.

868
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.140
Tell us how many millions
of Greats are ready

869
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.562
to give their Tokens of Love to Cat Purry?

870
01:13:00.562 --> 01:13:02.420
- Greats are a dog nation. dear.

871
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.453
They don't wanna see your
cat as their Sweetheart.

872
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.233
- We'll see about that.

873
01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.653
Take care. Clerk!

874
01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.380
- The legend tells that
my great great-grandfather

875
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.320
and a Navajo chief exchanged
their personal rifle

876
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.473
and tomahawk to seal a peace treaty.

877
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.840
- Why did the rifle come back?

878
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.950
- The ugly truth is that
our side broke peace.

879
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:40.180
murdered the Navajo
chief and all his tribe.

880
01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.453
took back the rifle and all his land.

881
01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:47.668
- I didn't know that.

882
01:13:47.668 --> 01:13:49.487
fascinating.

883
01:13:49.487 --> 01:13:50.813
And you are?

884
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.230
- Nobody.
- He's my assistant.

885
01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:54.320
- What for?

886
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.100
You're just inventing work
for yourself. old friend.

887
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.150
- Not exactly.

888
01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:01.000
If you care to take a
look at the Mind Map.

889
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.410
- He's pale. Whose kid is he anyway?

890
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.560
I don't remember seeing him on the island.

891
01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.096
- He's the Policeman's.

892
01:14:07.096 --> 01:14:08.747
- Ah. bloody Irish!

893
01:14:08.747 --> 01:14:12.610
Those Policeman reproduce
faster than Cat Purry.

894
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:15.040
You're lucky you have
such cute little sisters.

895
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.310
- I'm sure his Dad will be pleased

896
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:20.010
to know that the Alpha
Altruist fancies his daughters.

897
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.630
- Get rid of this rusty old piece of junk.

898
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.293
Let's talk business.

899
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.603
- Wait for me outside.

900
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.830
- Did you find my little princess?

901
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.393
- She tried to swim to
the mainland. she drowned.

902
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.620
- Why would she try to run away?

903
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.710
I treated her like my own daughter!

904
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.333
- She was tortured.

905
01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:55.503
- Clerk.

906
01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.510
I've known you forever.

907
01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:00.280
Do you think I could possibly torture

908
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.460
a little girl like that?

909
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.493
- Of course. not.

910
01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.683
But somebody tortured her.

911
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.433
- I passed her down to.

912
01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.440
the Philanthropist!

913
01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.273
Ask him.

914
01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.513
If he tortured her. that's it!

915
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.870
I will send him no more of the new ones.

916
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:21.983
No more of the new ones.

917
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.094
- Psst!

918
01:15:36.094 --> 01:15:36.927
Ugly Duck!

919
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.083
Ugly Duck!

920
01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.200
- Wow!

921
01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.469
You look beautiful!

922
01:15:59.469 --> 01:16:01.669
- Thank you. You're not
too shabby yourself.

923
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:04.000
- Meh!

924
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.230
My Dad made me wear these.

925
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.433
I had to blend in.

926
01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:11.784
- Who gave you this?

927
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:12.617
Where did you get this?

928
01:16:12.617 --> 01:16:14.800
- Alpha Altruist. he's really nice.

929
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.700
And did you see Jörg
Doberman and Cat Purry?

930
01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.760
- We have to go. now!

931
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.063
- No! I'm not your property!

932
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.223
- But I came to save you!

933
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:27.090
- From what?

934
01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:30.130
- Relax. old friend.
Greatland is doing just fine.

935
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.170
We have successfully avoided
a totalitarian dictatorship

936
01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:36.100
and steered the ship
toward a supra-democracy.

937
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.530
The Gender War is over.

938
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.420
Minorities decide for the majority.

939
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.033
And every Great has rights
but no responsibilities.

940
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:47.043
On that note.

941
01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.600
let's enjoy this beautiful sunset

942
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.360
on this perfect island. shall we?

943
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.650
- But the social peace is fragile.

944
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:58.883
replenishment of the population an issue.

945
01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.970
Greatland has lost its economic

946
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:05.650
and technological advantages to Evildom.

947
01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:07.853
- Enough! I'm gonna say this one time:

948
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.623
Don't be paranoid!

949
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.180
- Alpha Altruist rescued
me from the Optimists.

950
01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.148
He loves me like his own daughter.

951
01:17:26.148 --> 01:17:27.630
- You don't understand anything!

952
01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:30.513
The girl who was here
before you. they killed her!

953
01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.080
- What's "killed"?

954
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.840
- It's that Stone Age thing
we read about in books!

955
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.990
You're put out but like. forever!

956
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:39.160
No Resurrection. nada!

957
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.000
- Alpha Altruist said he'd
never let anyone hurt me.

958
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.610
This is the safest place on Earth!

959
01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.860
Ulysses. I love you. to what end deceive?

960
01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.880
But I am now another's bride.

961
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.703
For ever faithful will abide.

962
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:07.893
- Shit.

963
01:18:10.861 --> 01:18:11.694
- What?

964
01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.240
- Shit.

965
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.487
When I am angry I say "shit".

966
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.427
- We say "Love" and "Delight".

967
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.870
But I like your "Shit" better.

968
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.457
- Now say "Fuck!"

969
01:18:28.647 --> 01:18:29.737
- "Fuck"

970
01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:30.957
- Fuck!

971
01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:31.790
- Fuck!

972
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:32.623
- Fu uuuuu-ck!

973
01:18:32.623 --> 01:18:33.664
Shit!
- Fuck!

974
01:18:33.664 --> 01:18:34.810
- Shit!
- Fuck!

975
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:35.680
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

976
01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.742
- Shit!
- Shit!

977
01:18:36.742 --> 01:18:38.017
- Fuck!
- Shit!

978
01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:38.850
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

979
01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:39.683
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

980
01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.533
- Hello. Clerk.

981
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:56.960
Jesus. I've known you for so long

982
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.633
that I forgot your real name.

983
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:00.833
- I forgot myself.

984
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.900
- Sometimes this island
feels like a prison.

985
01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.040
We certainly behave like prisoners.

986
01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.320
Going by nicknames. dreaming of escaping.

987
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.385
- Pour vivre heureux. vivons cachés.

988
01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.513
- Yes. to live happy let's live hidden.

989
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.580
But don't you just wanna
go back to Greatland

990
01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.513
and restore everything
to how it was before?

991
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:34.730
We'll drop the act.

992
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.820
Call ourselves by our
real names and titles.

993
01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.230
Call everything by what it is.

994
01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.350
- You would hold the mirror up

995
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:45.570
to the masses of depressed
and neglected people.

996
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:47.187
What do you think the result would be?

997
01:19:47.187 --> 01:19:48.783
- I have no idea.

998
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.113
But I want real power.

999
01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.353
Not this golden retirement!

1000
01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.280
Are you too have this thirst.

1001
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.040
this passion for real impact?

1002
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.010
You want to leave a legacy.

1003
01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.800
You and I. we've been waiting

1004
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.390
in the shadow of Alpha
Altruist for decades.

1005
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.093
I've had enough!

1006
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.533
What about you?

1007
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:18.733
- It won't work.

1008
01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:24.630
We have no resources to
take power in Greatland.

1009
01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.570
- You are the smartest
and most competent person

1010
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:28.800
on this island.

1011
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.450
I'm the voice of Mother.

1012
01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:34.510
Together we can figure it out.

1013
01:20:39.977 --> 01:20:42.450
- We're a dying breed.

1014
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.743
We've been here our entire lives.

1015
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.223
It's too late in the day for escaping.

1016
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:01.143
- Coward!

1017
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.400
- She thinks that you are
the most competent guy

1018
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.673
on the island!

1019
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:21.143
And why is no one happy
in a Stone Age marriage?

1020
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.350
- I have a feeling that she's gonna try

1021
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.963
and overthrow the Alpha Altruist.

1022
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:29.913
- Seriously?

1023
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:33.390
Well. then why didn't you
take her up on her offer?

1024
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:35.710
- Because the future of
Greatland will be determined

1025
01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:37.250
by young people

1026
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:39.983
like you.

1027
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:45.149
And the strongest amongst them.

1028
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:47.120
- Don't look at me! I'm not strong.

1029
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.570
- I beg to differ.

1030
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.960
You smashed your bracelet.

1031
01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.080
You came to the aid of
a damsel in distress.

1032
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.810
You are a rebel!

1033
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:58.147
Live with it. embrace it.

1034
01:21:58.147 --> 01:21:59.943
- You really think I'm that dumb?

1035
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.120
You didn't give a shit about
me until you needed me.

1036
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.920
Now you expect me to achieve
everything you failed at.

1037
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:10.133
Crafty. Dad!

1038
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.123
Real crafty.

1039
01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:16.793
- Yeah. well.

1040
01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:19.083
that's about it.

1041
01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:24.003
- Unbelievable!

1042
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.663
She was right. you are a coward.

1043
01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.483
- I'm out! Thanks for the cookies. Dad.

1044
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.143
- Take your emotions out of the equation.

1045
01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:39.363
Think like a Clerk.

1046
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:42.893
- All right!

1047
01:22:44.833 --> 01:22:47.070
You help me to take Ugly Duck
away from the Alpha Altruist.

1048
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:48.757
and I'm game to save Greatland.

1049
01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.653
Come on!

1050
01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:55.173
Think like a Clerk.

1051
01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.673
- Deal.

1052
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:05.563
- All right.

1053
01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:09.600
Let's find out who's
killing all the Great girls.

1054
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.211
and show them that Clerks have teeth.

1055
01:23:42.919 --> 01:23:44.919
- Is this bug an insect?

1056
01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.683
Can it be?

1057
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:51.703
- Philanthropist.

1058
01:23:51.703 --> 01:23:55.550
the Alpha Altruist wants
to know what happened

1059
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:58.307
to the last girl he passed on to you.

1060
01:23:59.808 --> 01:24:00.641
- Oh yes!

1061
01:24:01.877 --> 01:24:04.173
The blond beast of prey.

1062
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:08.363
the magnificent blond beast!

1063
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.860
- Except this one wasn't avidly prowling

1064
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.090
for spoils of victory.

1065
01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:17.560
She was tortured and drowned.

1066
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:20.463
- Round bugs.

1067
01:24:22.992 --> 01:24:23.909
shiny bugs.

1068
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.313
fat bugs.

1069
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.083
lady bugs.

1070
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:35.053
I love bugs!

1071
01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:38.210
- He's full blast into bugs.

1072
01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:39.043
- No kidding?

1073
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:42.763
Philanthropist!

1074
01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:45.813
Who killed the girl?

1075
01:24:47.746 --> 01:24:52.142
- Heaven has no rage

1076
01:24:52.142 --> 01:24:54.913
like love to hatred turned.

1077
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.970
nor hell a fury

1078
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.340
like a woman scorned.

1079
01:25:04.589 --> 01:25:06.089
- "Woman scorned".

1080
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.400
that sounds like the
Alpha Altruist's wife.

1081
01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:14.530
- Ex ore parvulorum veritas.

1082
01:25:16.467 --> 01:25:18.167
- "This child speaks the truth."

1083
01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.343
Then Lady Omega has gone bonkers.

1084
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.133
Ugly Duck is in danger.

1085
01:25:30.007 --> 01:25:32.653
Greatland is in danger. We must hurry!

1086
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.470
- Cool bugs. man!

1087
01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:12.433
"To whom it may concern.

1088
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:15.180
I had killed myself.

1089
01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:19.010
My wife will become the next
Sweetheart of Greatland.

1090
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.747
Take care. the Alpha Altruist."

1091
01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:26.593
- She can't even write
a decent suicide note.

1092
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.713
Ulysses!

1093
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:35.364
- Time's up Ugly Duck!

1094
01:26:36.634 --> 01:26:37.884
Stupid redhead!

1095
01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:41.229
Die you little whore!

1096
01:26:42.438 --> 01:26:43.271
- Dad?

1097
01:26:43.271 --> 01:26:44.104
- Die now!

1098
01:26:46.322 --> 01:26:48.068
Ugly redhead you!

1099
01:26:48.068 --> 01:26:49.568
- Ulysses help me!

1100
01:26:51.723 --> 01:26:53.993
- Just how fucking dumb is she!

1101
01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:56.933
- No Dad! You could kill Ugly Duck!

1102
01:26:56.933 --> 01:26:58.233
I have to go and save her!

1103
01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:06.048
Not my Mother. not my Sweetheart.

1104
01:27:10.116 --> 01:27:10.949
Fuck!

1105
01:27:23.986 --> 01:27:25.683
- I'm so sorry. Ulysses!

1106
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.032
You were right!

1107
01:27:29.032 --> 01:27:30.760
Alpha Altruist tried to contaminate me

1108
01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:33.040
with his Life Force when his wife.

1109
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.033
- Small wonder

1110
01:27:35.829 --> 01:27:39.593
that Trojans and Achaeans endured so much

1111
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.893
and for so long.

1112
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.173
for the sake of a woman so
marvelously and divinely lovely.

1113
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:49.527
- You read the "Odyssey"!

1114
01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:05.723
- Gotcha!

1115
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.397
- She's heading to Greatland.

1116
01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:16.870
Our self-proclaimed Sweetheart needs TV

1117
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:18.023
to make herself legit.

1118
01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:19.840
- How do you know?

1119
01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.850
- That's the advantage
of spending your life

1120
01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:25.513
in the shadows of power.

1121
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.370
Plenty of time

1122
01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:29.893
to observe.

1123
01:28:32.012 --> 01:28:35.000
to learn

1124
01:28:38.278 --> 01:28:39.278
and prepare.

1125
01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.993
- My fellow Greats!

1126
01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:53.537
The time has come.

1127
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:59.700
According to the Tokens of
Love cast for both candidates.

1128
01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:02.167
the next Greatland's Sweetheart is

1129
01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.213
I'm nervous.

1130
01:29:10.135 --> 01:29:11.644
Jörg Doberman!

1131
01:29:11.644 --> 01:29:13.061
- Let's go champ!

1132
01:29:19.628 --> 01:29:21.176
- A dog again?!

1133
01:29:21.176 --> 01:29:24.737
- No loving way! Fraud! Rigged! Boo!

1134
01:29:24.737 --> 01:29:26.531
- Felinist goddesses!

1135
01:29:26.531 --> 01:29:28.114
Join my Revolution!

1136
01:29:37.192 --> 01:29:38.609
- I'm your Mother

1137
01:29:39.677 --> 01:29:43.893
and I proclaim myself the
Greatland's Sweetheart!

1138
01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.520
- Who the love is this?

1139
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.968
- Another one of those crazy Felinists!

1140
01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.580
- I'm so confused right now

1141
01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.930
it's making me lose weight.

1142
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.446
- My dear Great children!

1143
01:29:57.446 --> 01:29:59.200
I'm your Mother.

1144
01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.120
Don't listen to this woman.

1145
01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.353
She's an anti-Felinist hate-monger.

1146
01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.860
- Not my Sweetheart!

1147
01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.790
I'm not her! I'm who I
am and I deserve better!

1148
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:12.920
- Try soul-crushing pain and
devastation and hopelessness

1149
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.730
to describe how we are
feeling in this moment.

1150
01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:17.513
- No! Greats won't be silenced!

1151
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:02.380
My children!

1152
01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.020
As your Mother.

1153
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:08.440
I'm appalled and saddened to
inform you that this morning.

1154
01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:12.000
Jörg Doberman was cowardly
put out for Resurrection

1155
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.623
by this fanatic Felinist woman.

1156
01:31:18.610 --> 01:31:19.450
- Didn't we just say.

1157
01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:20.953
- Shush!

1158
01:31:20.953 --> 01:31:22.820
Everything you're saying now

1159
01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.800
is being broadcast across Greatland.

1160
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.510
- But didn't we just say
she was anti Felinist.

1161
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:31.160
and now we're saying she
is a Felinist fanatic!

1162
01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.890
- It doesn't matter.

1163
01:31:32.890 --> 01:31:34.590
Mother can say whatever she wants.

1164
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:40.443
- Clerk! Open up! We know you're there!

1165
01:31:44.062 --> 01:31:46.340
- Enough is enough!

1166
01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.007
Down with Felinists!

1167
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.860
- We're here on the order of Lady Omega.

1168
01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.460
Release the hostage immediately!

1169
01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.759
- What hostage?

1170
01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.873
Is it what I think?

1171
01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:25.913
- What?!

1172
01:32:25.913 --> 01:32:27.323
I found her on the floor.

1173
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:37.650
- Unrest is spreading.

1174
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:39.097
We need to deploy the Optimists.

1175
01:32:39.097 --> 01:32:40.740
- No way! This is fun!

1176
01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.291
- This is not a joke Ulysses!

1177
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:44.610
- Clerk! Don't make me do it!

1178
01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:46.610
- We're losing control of the situation!

1179
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:50.590
- Greatland is one big scam!

1180
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:51.650
No one cares.

1181
01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:52.780
No one tells the truth.

1182
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.390
No one should be in charge of this mess.

1183
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:57.023
Let it all blow to pieces!

1184
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.123
- Is this how we kill each other?

1185
01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.953
Ulysses. this is scary.

1186
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.173
How do we go back?

1187
01:33:08.272 --> 01:33:10.650
In our "Amazing Love Store

1188
01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:13.050
when something was broken. we'd fix it.

1189
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:15.848
Dad would never let us throw it away.

1190
01:33:15.848 --> 01:33:17.143
I want my Greatland back.

1191
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:22.220
Please. make this madness stop.

1192
01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.340
- The majority of Greats
are feeling the same way.

1193
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.250
I guarantee you they're scared.

1194
01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:28.050
- Clerk! You're a dead man!

1195
01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:32.060
- Ulysses. you came here as Nobody.

1196
01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.133
Now you have Duck.

1197
01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:36.793
Together. you are Everybody.

1198
01:33:39.087 --> 01:33:41.670
- And what does Everybody want?

1199
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.050
My children. Greats don't hate.

1200
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:26.370
We love.

1201
01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:28.370
No need to fight.

1202
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:31.230
I. your Mother. will make sure that sons

1203
01:35:31.230 --> 01:35:34.470
of Jörg Doberman grow
strong and will compete

1204
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:37.990
for the Greatland's Sweetheart
title in the near future.

1205
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:41.080
By love. we live forever!

1206
01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.240
Meanwhile. Cat Purry will act

1207
01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.393
as Greatland's Interim Sweetheart.

1208
01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.270
- Phew. what a scare!

1209
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:57.140
But all's well that ends well.

1210
01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.020
All love and admire Cat Purry!

1211
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.585
- All love and admire Cat Purry!

1212
01:36:03.585 --> 01:36:06.520
- The new Greatland Sweetheart!

1213
01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.295
- The new Greatland Sweetheart!

1214
01:36:09.295 --> 01:36:12.128
- Greatland! Greatland! Greatland!

1215
01:36:26.923 --> 01:36:28.020
- Clerk! We're breaking in!

1216
01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:33.357
- All right. time's up.

1217
01:37:10.535 --> 01:37:11.368
- Come on!

1218
01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:29.760
- Why did you blow up
the House on the Hill?

1219
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.140
I thought you were all for continuity!

1220
01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.023
- I snapped.

1221
01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.180
I owe your Father a great debt.

1222
01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:40.513
This is for you.

1223
01:37:41.633 --> 01:37:43.693
a small token of my gratitude.

1224
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.470
- Thank you. Uncle Clerk.

1225
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:48.450
- With the House on the Hill gone.

1226
01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:50.950
this is the only thing
that commands the Optimists

1227
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:53.877
and pretty much everything in Greatland.

1228
01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:58.210
You are Mother now.

1229
01:37:58.210 --> 01:38:01.067
- Uncle Clerk. you mean so much to me.

1230
01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:07.295
- Clerk! It's over! Give up Cat Purry!

1231
01:38:12.157 --> 01:38:14.330
- Get to the boat! They won't
follow you to the mainland.

1232
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:16.910
They're shit scared of Greats.

1233
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:18.077
- No. I'm not leaving you!

1234
01:38:18.077 --> 01:38:19.513
- Listen to me. Clerk.

1235
01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:24.490
Rule Greatland in Cat Purry's name.

1236
01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:27.540
Open the minds of the Greats gradually.

1237
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:31.640
No chaos. no brisk
moves. smooth transition.

1238
01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.680
Study the Mind Map. it has many levels.

1239
01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.910
Find the blueprint for the
Great Reform and follow it.

1240
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.073
- Please. come with me!

1241
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:42.560
- This island's all I know.

1242
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.963
I am a coward. Ulysses.

1243
01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.880
I wouldn't last a day in a new world.

1244
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.418
- Ulysses hurry up!

1245
01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:53.951
- By love. we live forever! Now go!

1246
01:38:53.951 --> 01:38:55.001
Ulysses!

1247
01:38:58.888 --> 01:38:59.721
- Hey!

1248
01:39:00.787 --> 01:39:01.620
Hey!

1249
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:08.823
- Be strong saith my heart.

1250
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:12.020
I am a Clerk.

1251
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:50.920
There will be killing
until the score is paid.
