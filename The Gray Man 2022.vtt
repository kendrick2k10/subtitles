<i>If this is about Winky's Cantina.</i>
<i>I didn't have anything to do with it.</i>

4
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.416
<i>It's not about Winky's Cantina.</i>

5
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.375
<i>I like honey buns</i>
<i>as much as the next guy.</i>

6
00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.958
-<i>I'm not gonna gouge your eye out for one.</i>

7
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:37.083
You gonna write that down?

8
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.375
I'm not gonna write anything down.

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.583
You want some gum?

10
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.416
What kind you got?

11
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.250
"Bubblicious Watermelon Wave."
What do you say?

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.375
There is no other kind.

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.041
If you think I'm gonna rat somebody out
for Bubblicious.

14
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.000
you got another thing coming to you.

15
00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:04.250
Watermelon or not.

16
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:10.125
"Courtland Gentry. Born 1980."

17
00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.666
"Incarcerated 1995."

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.458
"Eligible for parole in 2031."

19
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:19.583
You got a long way to go. son.

20
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.166
There's an upside
to sleeping so close to your toilet.

21
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.000
I get it. You're glib.

22
00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.583
Well. I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

23
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.875
My name is Donald Fitzroy.
and I'm here to commute your sentence.

24
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.250
You're gonna commute my sentence?

25
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.750
-Yes.
-Just like that?

26
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.000
When I get out of this chair
and walk out of this prison.

27
00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:36.916
you'll walk with me.

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.541
Who are you.
my fairy godmother?

29
00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.250
No offense.
I thought you'd look different.

30
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.583
I may be. We'll see.

31
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.458
What's the catch?

32
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.875
You work for us.

33
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.291
-Who's "us"?
-The CIA.

34
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.666
We're gonna train you to kill bad guys.

35
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.250
And since you've already killed one.
it shouldn't be too difficult.

36
00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:58.791
What makes you think I wanna do it again?

37
00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.625
You seem like the type.

38
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.625
You'd be part of an elite unit.
the Sierra program.

39
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.791
You would exist in the gray.

40
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Disposable?

41
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:14.625
I've studied your case.
I know why you pulled that trigger.

42
00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:16.708
I would've done the same thing myself.

43
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:21.500
Now. I'm here to help you become
a value-add instead of a value lost.

44
00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:24.541
So why don't you take all the pain
or whatever the hell got you here.

45
00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.166
turn it around. and make it useful?

46
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.250
How long do I gotta work for you?

47
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.875
Let's just say
you'd be indefinitely useful.

48
00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.125
Do you need anything?

49
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.625
No. I'm good.

50
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:03.958
Nice suit.

51
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:06.125
I just wear what they tell me to.

52
00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:07.541
Subtle.

53
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.875
You're no fly on the wall yourself.

54
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.333
I don't have a permit.

55
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.000
It's not that kind of party.

56
00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:14.750
<i>Six. you copy?</i>

57
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.833
<i>Six.</i>

58
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.041
Six. copy.

59
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.041
Sir. I have him.

60
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.791
Six. this is Denny Carmichael.
your center chief.

61
00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:39.625
<i>Our target. code name "Dining Car."</i>
<i>is selling information</i>

62
00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:42.166
<i>that could severely compromise</i>
<i>national security.</i>

63
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.083
We need him eliminated before
that transaction is complete. Understood?

64
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:46.708
<i> Understood.</i>

65
00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.250
Please explain to me
why I'm talking to a Sierra agent

66
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.000
instead of somebody
in our circle of trust.

67
00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:52.916
There was no time
to get one of ours over there.

68
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.041
Six was in the region.

69
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.541
and he happens to be historically good
at the job.

70
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.958
Subject on approach.

71
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:10.958
<i>I have eyes on Dining Car.</i>

72
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.875
<i>Target imminent.</i>

73
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.458
Be advised. he's not alone.

74
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.625
Dining Car has security.

75
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.625
<i>Stay the plan.</i>

76
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:34.291
<i>He's coming up on you now. Six.</i>

77
00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:47.583
He's almost to you.

78
00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.250
<i>My friend. You made it.</i>

79
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.625
<i>Who are all these people?</i>

80
00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:05.416
<i>Future friends. future ex-wives.</i>

81
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.875
<i>Get rid of them.</i>

82
00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.833
<i>Relax. Safer this way…</i>

83
00:07:09.916 --> 00:07:12.458
<i>Don't tell me to relax.</i>
<i>I want my money.</i>

84
00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:14.416
<i>So just transfer it and get it done.</i>

85
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.541
<i>Do you understand the risk I've taken</i>
<i>by coming here?</i>

86
00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:20.500
<i>You have no idea of the kind of people</i>
<i>you're gonna have to deal with.</i>

87
00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:22.208
<i>and they are gonna come for this.</i>

88
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.416
Target acquired.

89
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
<i>Execute.</i>

90
00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:29.000
<i>Nothing stops them.</i>
<i>They can get to anyone. anywhere.</i>

91
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.666
<i>Yep.</i>

92
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.583
Six.
why am I not hearing anything?

93
00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:42.708
I'm picking up collateral.

94
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:44.416
<i>There's a kid near the mark.</i>

95
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.750
You're cleared for collateral.

96
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.958
-<i>Go loud.</i>
-<i>Did you bring it?</i>

97
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.500
<i>Let's talk price.</i>

98
00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:56.958
We have a very small window
to take out a very bad dude.

99
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:59.083
<i>Go loud. Six.</i>

100
00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:03.375
Ten. nine. eight.

101
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.958
seven. six. five.

102
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.166
four. three. two. one.

103
00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:17.541
-Stand by.
-<i>Do not stand by.</i>

104
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.583
Gun jammed.

105
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.791
Aww. shit.

106
00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:44.791
Let's move out.

107
00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.583
Six. was that you?

108
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.416
Where are you going?

109
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.750
-Deal's off.
-Six.

110
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.375
You know I know who you are.

111
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:09.416
You're Sierra Six.

112
00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:13.166
They didn't tell you who I am. did they?

113
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.666
They never do.

114
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.291
I'm Sierra Four.

115
00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.083
They sent you out to kill one of your own.

116
00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:22.291
But that's probably
not gonna make you walk away. is it?

117
00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:27.625
Probably not.

118
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:13.250
If you're Sierra. who recruited you?

119
00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:15.291
Fitzroy.

120
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:16.958
<i>Same as you.</i>

121
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.958
-<i>Where'd you train?</i>
<i>Dark site.</i>

122
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:22.875
Tel Aviv. Same as you.

123
00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.458
I got all the answers
'cause I'm telling the truth.

124
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:28.250
<i>They're </i>not.

125
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.375
Denny Carmichael is a piece of shit.

126
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:38.208
That's why I'm sitting here
in my own blood.

127
00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:41.208
-You're probably next.

128
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:44.083
Hey.

129
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.916
Take this

130
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.291
and bring the bastard down.

131
00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:54.083
I don't want it.

132
00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:56.375
You trust Carmichael?

133
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.000
Just… take it.

134
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:05.416
Please.

135
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.708
Okay. you know what?

136
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.916
There you go. I took it. okay?

137
00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.375
You give 'em hell. Six.

138
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.208
Very discreet.

139
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.500
I thought this'd be cleaner.

140
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.458
It wasn't.

141
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.083
We're Romeo.

142
00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.208
He said he was Sierra.

143
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:44.083
That wasn't in the mission folder.

144
00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.083
He knew who I was.

145
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.125
Maybe he had access
to stolen intel.

146
00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.333
I'm Sierra. There is no intel.

147
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:00.416
It's ours now. agent.

148
00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:03.333
Agent.

149
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:06.291
I heard you.

150
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.416
I just chose to ignore you.

151
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:24.208
-One wristwatch.
-Wristwatch.

152
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.000
-R1. smartphone.
-R1. smartphone.

153
00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.750
-Money clip. lighter. pen.
-L1. money clip. pen. lighter.

154
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:31.708
SSE complete.

155
00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.833
It's Dawson. I need Carmichael.

156
00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.375
<i>No joy. I repeat. no joy.</i>

157
00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:44.458
This is why I wanted
the Sierra program made extinct.

158
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.041
I want nothing left from that old regime.

159
00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:49.750
These things take time. Denny.
There are politics to unravel.

160
00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.500
-Get out.
-What?

161
00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:54.291
Get out.

162
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:11.083
-Six.
-<i>Wanna explain whatever that was?</i>

163
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.666
Gun jammed.

164
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.666
That doesn't qualify as an explanation.

165
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.541
Maybe on a secure line.

166
00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.208
<i>I need a status report.</i>

167
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.500
Insecure line.

168
00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:22.041
<i>Did the target say anything to you?</i>

169
00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.083
Well. he was dead.

170
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:25.958
so. you know. no.

171
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:29.708
<i>What about pocket litter?</i>
<i>Did you get anything off his body?</i>

172
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:36.000
Six. did he have anything on his person

173
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.791
<i>that you now have</i>
<i>that you'd like to give to me?</i>

174
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.833
Who was he?

175
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.083
A bad guy.

176
00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:47.166
-Carrying?
-Bad shit.

177
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.166
<i>Last chance. Six.</i>

178
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:54.458
Understood.

179
00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.541
Hey.

180
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:01.750
You a 42 regular?

181
00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:16.375
Hey. take the shot.
Take the shot!

182
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.833
Yeah.

183
00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:46.083
Wheels up in five.
Carmichael's been calling.

184
00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:47.875
We spoke.

185
00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:50.083
You should go without me.

186
00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:52.416
You sure you wanna do that?

187
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:55.875
<i>What happened with the target. Six?</i>

188
00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.666
<i>Tell me what I don't know.</i>

189
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.375
Well. that's the problem. isn't it?

190
00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:19.625
<i>Hey. pal.</i>

191
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.000
Wanna trade?

192
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.333
<i>Max's Fireplace and Barbecue.</i>

193
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.250
You Max?

194
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.875
There is no Max.

195
00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.500
<i>-So it's like "to the max"?</i>
-Yeah.

196
00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:47.583
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

197
00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:50.166
Because if something went wrong.
I couldn't blame Max.

198
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.541
-How you doing. Fitz?
<i>-It's good to hear from you. kid.</i>

199
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.416
How's life in retirement?

200
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.708
I'm headed to a funeral.
Putting a friend in the ground.

201
00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.166
I'm getting to that age. you know?

202
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.791
<i>-You working?</i>
-I was.

203
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:02.291
<i>-Got loud?</i>
-It got loud.

204
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:03.916
Got real weird too.

205
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.291
You know that guy
that handed you your walking papers?

206
00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:07.666
Yeah. Carmichael.

207
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.083
<i>Well. brace yourself.</i>
<i>but. uh. he might be sideways.</i>

208
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.291
I'm shocked.

209
00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:13.708
What's your gut?

210
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:16.333
My gut? It's gonna be my funeral
you're going to next.

211
00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:18.916
<i>Give me an hour</i>
<i>to find a local extraction team.</i>

212
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.791
<i>Get mobile. You may have to hustle.</i>

213
00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:24.333
Let me ask you a question.
Four have a scar on his right chin?

214
00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:25.500
Yeah.

215
00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:28.166
-They just had me stick a fork in him.
-Pretense?

216
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.958
Some foreign op bullshit.
You know they don't tell me much.

217
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.291
He gave me something they really want.

218
00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:35.291
<i>On person?</i>

219
00:17:36.458 --> 00:17:38.333
No. Somewhere safe.

220
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:39.250
<i>Good boy.</i>

221
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:43.208
Well. I'll do some checking.
I still have friends up the food chain.

222
00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:45.250
<i>-Where are ya?</i>
-Bangkok.

223
00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:49.583
<i>There's an airfield near Chiang Mai.</i>
<i>Get to it. Watch your back.</i>

224
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:50.500
You too.

225
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.083
Hey. Fitz.

226
00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:56.666
I know there wasn't some
palm trees 401k plan for me. but. uh.

227
00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:01.625
I mean. at least tell me
you guys had some kind of exit strategy.

228
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:03.958
<i>We never got that far. kid.</i>

229
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.833
And now. probably not.

230
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:09.041
Got it.

231
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:09.958
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

232
00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.166
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

233
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.416
Beats being on the wrong side of the bars.

234
00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:35.458
Why is it always the last stall?

235
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.875
Al Capone booth.
I can see everything from here.

236
00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.541
He blew off his exfil.

237
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:43.541
Son of a--

238
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.916
-He's got it.
-Not necessarily.

239
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.750
Yes. necessarily.

240
00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:55.041
That knuckle-dragger sweated me
on the phone. He knows.

241
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.458
So…

242
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:02.375
Never should have touched Fitzroy's guys.
They're all criminals.

243
00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.583
You through?

244
00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:05.458
What do you wanna do?

245
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:07.458
What we should have done from the start.

246
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:09.958
-No. no. absolutely not.
-You had your shot.

247
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:12.125
Lloyd Hansen is a sociopath.

248
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:14.541
-You say that like it's a bad thing.
-It's a dangerous thing.

249
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.958
-He has methods.
-Sociopathic methods.

250
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:20.500
So sit on him. The guy has a higher
kill count than the entire Mossad.

251
00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:23.291
I don't need Lloyd stable.
I need him effective.

252
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.750
-Should we try again?
-No.

253
00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:32.875
-Boring.

254
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:44.916
"Mostly. it's loss

255
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:48.083
which teaches us
about the worth of things."

256
00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:52.416
That's Arthur Schopenhauer.
He was a German philosopher. a pessimist.

257
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.750
-He saw the value in suffering.

258
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:03.458
Damn it.
Phones on silent when I'm working. please.

259
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.541
It's yours.

260
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:06.708
Who is it?

261
00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:07.750
The chief.

262
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.041
Be right back.

263
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:17.750
Yeah.

264
00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:19.541
-He talk yet?
<i>Still just flirting.</i>

265
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:20.500
But…

266
00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:22.666
he's getting there.

267
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.083
You watch the game on Saturday?

268
00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.833
I turned it off at halftime.
They ran us off the field.

269
00:20:26.916 --> 00:20:29.041
Well. no one goes to Harvard
to play football.

270
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.083
<i>You did.</i>

271
00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:32.666
I like to be the exception. What's up?

272
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.000
Hand the jumper cables to somebody else.
I got an urgent locate and destroy.

273
00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:38.375
-<i>Gimme a name.</i>
Sierra Six.

274
00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.625
Could be fun.
The man's got some street cred.

275
00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:43.125
<i>He got his hands</i>
<i>on some compromising information.</i>

276
00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.375
the kind that could put us all
in a cold. dark place.

277
00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:49.250
So. get it back. Make him gone.

278
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:53.208
-Does the old man know about this?
-Not yet. Heads would roll.

279
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:56.000
Well. I'm gonna need a full green light
on this one. Open checkbook.

280
00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:57.708
Any means necessary.

281
00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:01.125
And. Lloyd. I'm sending Suzanne to assist.

282
00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:03.333
I'd rather you punch me in the dick.

283
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:05.500
I will gladly punch you
in the dick. Lloyd.

284
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:08.375
All right. ladies. focus.
Six is trained to be a ghost.

285
00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:09.333
How do we find him?

286
00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:12.583
-<i>How close were he and Fitzroy?</i>
-Father-son kind of close.

287
00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:13.791
Get me Fitzroy's file.

288
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:17.458
-We'll find somebody he loves and squeeze.

289
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:19.666
<i> Do me right. Lloyd.</i>

290
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.750
<i>Have I ever done you wrong. Denny?</i>

291
00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:26.416
Denny. that man is nothing but wrong.

292
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.708
Don't be a brat.
He's gonna help you clean up your mess.

293
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:30.500
So now I'm the scapegoat?

294
00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm the boss.

295
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.333
You were the one
who lost the asset in the first place.

296
00:21:34.416 --> 00:21:36.125
And you couldn't get it back.

297
00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:39.791
You know. the last person
that pissed off the old man

298
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.416
ended up floating in the Potomac.

299
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.708
If you like breathing.

300
00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.541
you might wanna fix this.

301
00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:55.416
Who's the extract?

302
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.166
You know better than to ask.

303
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.416
Fitzroy really likes this guy

304
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.250
or really wants him the hell out of Asia.

305
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.125
Heads up.

306
00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:10.000
Military-aged male.
eleven o'clock.

307
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.416
You my ride?

308
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.708
Identity challenge. Heathen.

309
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:32.791
Response. hermit.

310
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:43.416
Need anything?

311
00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:45.791
Just a nap.

312
00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:48.500
Load 'em up.

313
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.500
Wheels up in two. Okay. hold on.

314
00:22:55.333 --> 00:22:56.583
It's the chief. For you.

315
00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:01.583
-<i>Agent Miranda?</i>
-Speaking.

316
00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:03.833
Denny Carmichael.
See that plane across the way?

317
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.041
Yeah. Hard to miss.

318
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:09.125
Get on it. You're meeting me in Berlin.

319
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:11.708
-I'm supposed to be in Singapore.
<i>-Not anymore.</i>

320
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.541
<i>-See you in Berlin.</i>

321
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.083
Hey. Fitz.

322
00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:44.333
I know you?

323
00:23:44.416 --> 00:23:45.958
Professionally maybe.

324
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:49.166
Lloyd Hansen. Hansen Government Services.

325
00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:51.000
Rings a bell.

326
00:23:51.083 --> 00:23:52.166
Aw. does it?

327
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.208
Good. You know my work.
That'll make this next part a lot easier.

328
00:23:56.833 --> 00:23:58.541
-Where is he?
-Where's who?

329
00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.541
-You really wanna do this?
-Do what?

330
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:07.250
You know what makes me sad. Don?

331
00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.583
Your small hands?

332
00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:11.708
You spent your whole life basically
building Sierra from the ground up.

333
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:16.083
and here you are. out to pasture.
burying all your old buddies.

334
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:19.625
Remind me. Hansen.
how long did you last at the agency?

335
00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.208
-Six months?
-Five and a half.

336
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:24.750
Bad ethics. zero impulse control.
unsanctioned torture.

337
00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:25.833
Something like that.

338
00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:29.083
So how's the private sector treating ya?
Does it pay as well as they say?

339
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.166
Or do you spend most of your time
strangling cats?

340
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.583
Who likes cats?

341
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:33.708
I like cats.

342
00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.916
Let's talk about the mess your boy made.

343
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.541
-He doesn't make messes.
-Oh. he made a big one.

344
00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:49.208
And judging by your shallow breathing
and puckered asshole.

345
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:51.125
I can only assume you know why I'm here.

346
00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:52.208
He has his reasons.

347
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:53.791
I'm sure he does.

348
00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:56.083
But see. that's the beauty
of the private sector.

349
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:58.875
I don't care about reasons.

350
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:01.875
<i>My guess is you're helping him already.</i>

351
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.208
<i>So this shouldn't put</i>
<i>too much of a dent in your day.</i>

352
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:06.666
You know I can't find him.
'cause his file doesn't exist.

353
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.791
But your file.

354
00:25:08.666 --> 00:25:10.166
<i>well. that's chock-full of nuggets.</i>

355
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.041
<i>some of which might make you rethink</i>
<i>your fussy attitude.</i>

356
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.416
Now. I tried to get her to smile. but. uh…

357
00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:18.833
you know kids.

358
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:02.958
Yeah.

359
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:04.958
<i>You know</i>
<i>the individual you're escorting?</i>

360
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:07.500
-Mm-hmm.
-<i>I want him terminated.</i>

361
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:10.875
Come again?

362
00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:13.500
<i>Keep the body</i>
<i>and everything he has on his person.</i>

363
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.875
Just make it painless. you understand?

364
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.708
Roger that.

365
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:22.041
Good boy. Fitz.

366
00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:51.541
<i>We've had a loss of pressure</i>
<i>in the cabin.</i>

367
00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:53.208
<i>Put on emergency oxygen masks.</i>

368
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:55.958
<i>Repeat. Put on emergency oxygen masks.</i>

369
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:23.833
You gonna answer it?

370
00:30:28.291 --> 00:30:30.375
Well. let's hope it's good news.

371
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.333
Speakerphone.

372
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.416
Hello.

373
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.541
It's me.

374
00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:37.583
<i>Where are you?</i>

375
00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:38.625
Emotionally?

376
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.083
I've been better.

377
00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:43.333
<i>The extraction team?</i>

378
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.333
They've been better too.

379
00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:48.041
Are you okay? You hurt?

380
00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:49.958
You know what. Fitz?

381
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:53.333
I'm trying to figure out
what answer it is that you want.

382
00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.458
<i>They leveraged me. kid.</i>

383
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.375
They have my niece.

384
00:30:57.541 --> 00:30:58.541
You hear me?

385
00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:00.125
Hold on. You're breaking up.

386
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.958
Shit.

387
00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:02.875
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:05.000
<i>Hello?</i>

389
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:07.583
Okay. there you are.

390
00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:10.208
<i>Sounds like you're in a real pickle. Fitz.</i>

391
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.291
Hey. sunshine. Lloyd Hansen here.

392
00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:15.291
<i>-I'm the one running this op.</i>
-What op?

393
00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:17.291
The one where I get exactly what I want.

394
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.500
I'm a little unclear as to what that is.

395
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.833
<i>Okay. that's fair. Well. why don't</i>
<i>you come on in. and we can chat?</i>

396
00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.916
<i>My assistant will get lunch.</i>
<i>You like sushi?</i>

397
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.375
No. I'm good. I…

398
00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:28.625
just had some Skittles.

399
00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:31.041
Tell you what. Why don't we skip lunch.

400
00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.958
you can give me the asset you stole.

401
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.625
and I won't have to chop your head off?

402
00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:38.125
<i>When you say things</i>
<i>like "chop your head off."</i>

403
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:40.416
it makes you sound untrustworthy.

404
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.125
So. even if I had this thing.
I'm not sure I would give it to you.

405
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:45.500
Oh. I think you would.

406
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.625
See. your old COS here
has drawn way outside the lines.

407
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:53.500
Headquarters needs a scapegoat.
and his neck is just about the right size.

408
00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:56.625
<i>Fitz is a big boy.</i>
<i>He knows what business he's in.</i>

409
00:31:56.708 --> 00:31:58.500
<i>-Hey. Lloyd.</i>
-Yeah?

410
00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.375
I immediately don't like you.

411
00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:02.666
Well. I'm glad we're on the same page.

412
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.500
Looks like you overplayed your hand.

413
00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.041
Looks like you need a new phone.

414
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:22.125
-Let me give you a word of advice. Lloyd.
-Hmm.

415
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:25.041
They say that life
in its most unadorned expression

416
00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:26.375
is a battle of wills.

417
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:29.583
Six's will is preternatural
compared to yours.

418
00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:33.625
Don't say "preternatural" to me.

419
00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:34.791
It's an asshole word.

420
00:32:34.875 --> 00:32:35.916
You're a child.

421
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.791
A child that's about to put a hit
so big on your boy's head

422
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:42.291
that even his most loyal allies
won't hesitate to drop a dime.

423
00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:44.875
<i>Every grade-A wet team</i>
<i>from here to Reykjavík</i>

424
00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:49.375
will be vying for the prestige
of killing the infamous Sierra Six.

425
00:32:49.458 --> 00:32:51.750
<i>I'll dig up every safe house</i>
<i>he's ever stayed in.</i>

426
00:32:51.833 --> 00:32:54.875
<i>I'll unearth every man or woman</i>
<i>he's ever slept with.</i>

427
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500
Your boy won't be able to walk ten feet
without getting his head blown off.

428
00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:04.541
<i>And that. Don. is exactly what bad ethics</i>
<i>and zero impulse control will get you.</i>

429
00:33:04.625 --> 00:33:05.708
I can kill anybody.

430
00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:07.583
Maybe not anybody.

431
00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:08.625
Well. we'll see.

432
00:33:14.708 --> 00:33:16.916
-You got a full bar on this thing?
-Yes. sir.

433
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.000
<i>Six.</i>

434
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.083
Come.

435
00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:13.166
Fitz. tell him why he's here.

436
00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:15.000
Okay.

437
00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:17.958
I have a niece that I'm raising.

438
00:34:18.875 --> 00:34:20.625
I know what line of work I'm in.

439
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:25.541
I want the kid to have a normal life.
and Margaret's helped me give her one.

440
00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:28.000
Any number of nefarious assholes

441
00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:30.541
would like to see him and his family dead.

442
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.500
Is there a point to this story?

443
00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:34.416
Someone in the DC office

444
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.833
has accidentally leaked Fitz's address
in Hong Kong.

445
00:34:37.916 --> 00:34:40.125
-Bunch of idiots.
-Indeed.

446
00:34:40.208 --> 00:34:42.000
We've asked for agency security.

447
00:34:42.083 --> 00:34:45.000
but for some curious reason.

448
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.916
Denny Carmichael won't supply it.

449
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500
Fitz is starting a mission
in Brazil tomorrow.

450
00:34:49.583 --> 00:34:51.791
which means you are going to babysit.

451
00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:59.500
<i>My brother and his wife died</i>
<i>about three years ago.</i>

452
00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:02.583
<i>and to top it off.</i>
<i>Claire was born with a heart condition.</i>

453
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.166
<i>Last month we put in a pacemaker.</i>

454
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.875
and since then.
she's been in and out of Mount St. Mary's.

455
00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:13.125
Poor thing got dealt a brutal hand.

456
00:35:13.708 --> 00:35:16.416
You guys taught me how to kill people.
not care for them.

457
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.375
You don't have to care.
Just keep her alive.

458
00:35:21.416 --> 00:35:24.208
Claire. dear. This is Six.

459
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:27.375
He'll be looking after the house
while Donald is away.

460
00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:30.041
-Just the two exits?
-Yes. That's right.

461
00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:34.041
Six is an odd name.

462
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:35.708
Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.291
Just. uh. 007 was taken. so…

464
00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:41.083
Are you chewing gum?

465
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:43.250
Yep.

466
00:35:43.333 --> 00:35:44.916
We don't chew gum in this house.

467
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.791
I wasn't… briefed.

468
00:35:48.458 --> 00:35:50.208
-Won't happen again.

469
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.916
Hmm. Okay.

470
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.875
Well. I'll try and stay out of your way.

471
00:35:57.458 --> 00:35:58.416
Do you mind?

472
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.083
Hmm.

473
00:36:04.458 --> 00:36:05.458
May I?

474
00:36:06.583 --> 00:36:07.416
Sure.

475
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:09.291
Thanks.

476
00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:11.666
Nice to meet you.

477
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.250
Excuse me.

478
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:21.166
Looking for your jacket?

479
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.583
Looks like I sat on it.

480
00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:25.375
Is that a secure phone?

481
00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:29.083
Just got the high score.

482
00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:32.458
I had a lot of time to practice
after the operation.

483
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.583
They made me stay in bed.

484
00:36:37.083 --> 00:36:39.416
"How long they make you stay in bed for?"

485
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.666
Quite a long time.
Several weeks. actually.

486
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.750
"Oh. hope you're okay."

487
00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:45.750
Better now. Six. Thanks for asking.

488
00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:48.291
How's your time been here?
Enjoying the grounds?

489
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:49.208
"Oh. they're lovely."

490
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:52.208
"I like to walk in circles
and stare at my shoes."

491
00:36:52.833 --> 00:36:54.125
Can I get that jacket?

492
00:36:58.291 --> 00:36:59.791
Like your tattoo.

493
00:36:59.875 --> 00:37:01.750
Where'd you get it? Prison?

494
00:37:02.416 --> 00:37:03.958
Yeah. actually.

495
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.750
I'm shocked.

496
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.166
What's it mean. the writing?

497
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:12.625
Oh. it's. you know…

498
00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:15.625
It's a guy's name in Greek.

499
00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:17.125
-What guy?
-Just a guy.

500
00:37:17.208 --> 00:37:19.500
You know. trying to get a rock up a hill.

501
00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:21.083
-Why?
-They made him.

502
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.458
-Who made him?
-The gods.

503
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.333
Did they need a rock?

504
00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:27.166
They were just trying
to punish him. I think.

505
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.375
Did he deserve it?

506
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:29.333
Probably.

507
00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:32.916
-Did he like it?
-Probably not.

508
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.541
So why'd he do it?

509
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:37.666
You ask a lot of questions.

510
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.750
You're quite the conversationalist.

511
00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:41.458
I'm gonna get back to work.

512
00:37:43.083 --> 00:37:44.083
Hey.

513
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:49.125
-Does he ever get to the top of the hill?

514
00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:52.583
I'll let you know.

515
00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:07.000
Claire's asleep. I'm going out for a bite.

516
00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.458
Mr. Six.

517
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.291
Something's wrong.

518
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.375
Start a bag…

519
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.208
She's stabilized.

520
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:50.291
Tell Donald
there was a programming glitch.

521
00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:52.708
We were able to repair it. non-invasive.

522
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:55.750
The remote system flagged it
ten minutes before he pulled up.

523
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.541
We can keep track of her pacemaker
from just about anywhere.

524
00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:00.625
Thank you. I'll let him know.

525
00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:03.291
Donald.

526
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.458
-You feeling better?

527
00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:22.625
Just another Thursday.

528
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:28.791
Donald says
this is the best medicine.

529
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:30.125
ice cream.

530
00:39:30.708 --> 00:39:31.666
Tend to agree.

531
00:39:32.375 --> 00:39:33.666
He's a very smart man.

532
00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:35.750
Only family I got.

533
00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:37.750
Closest thing to family I got too.

534
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:41.791
Maybe that kind of makes us family.

535
00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:48.500
-You should go to bed.

536
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:50.250
All right. little one.

537
00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:52.166
You heard the number. Let's go.

538
00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:54.875
Night. robot.

539
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.833
-Good night. Claire.

540
00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:02.291
Can I play a record?

541
00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:04.291
Just one.
and don't forget to brush your teeth.

542
00:40:05.666 --> 00:40:06.750
I'm going
to start the tub.

543
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:14.583
I'll take care of the cleanup.

544
00:40:14.666 --> 00:40:17.250
because you've had a very long day.

545
00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.291
All right.

546
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.083
Is everything okay?

547
00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:17.041
Yeah. Broke a bowl.

548
00:41:20.166 --> 00:41:21.375
You sure you're all right?

549
00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:25.166
Yeah. just another Thursday.

550
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.750
You should go to bed.

551
00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:31.291
Good night.

552
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.000
Night.

553
00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.583
-I got dry cleaning.

554
00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:45.583
-I want the works.

555
00:42:45.666 --> 00:42:48.250
Starched. cleaned. pressed.
and I want it same-day service.

556
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.333
Can you do it or what?

557
00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:52.125
That's a very expensive laundry list.

558
00:42:56.291 --> 00:43:00.541
You seem like a man
who wants his shirts done right.

559
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:12.541
<i>I'm in a bit of a hurry.</i>

560
00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:16.500
I'm also gonna need
to get into a secure system.

561
00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:18.500
Sure.

562
00:43:18.583 --> 00:43:21.166
You really are the. uh. full buffet.

563
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:23.958
aren't you?

564
00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:29.166
I do passports over there.

565
00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:32.416
And. uh. well. let's do your…
Let's do this thing first.

566
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.708
You can sit. You can sit here.

567
00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:37.333
Where are you going?

568
00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:38.541
It's…

569
00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:41.583
What's… What's the secure system?

570
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.250
Cormeum Electronics.

571
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:47.583
Cormeum…

572
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:49.666
Electronics. uh…

573
00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:52.666
It's medical supplies.

574
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.125
Don't… Don't touch that door.

575
00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:56.833
Yeah. I'm looking for a pacemaker.

576
00:43:56.916 --> 00:43:58.500
I can get you a serial number.

577
00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:00.416
That's all I need.

578
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.750
-Name?
-Fitzroy.

579
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:04.875
Claire Fitzroy.

580
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:06.916
This will be a minute.

581
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.375
I'm getting that.

582
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.541
I think you should go get yourself
cleaned up before we take your pictures.

583
00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:17.041
Unless bloody and beaten
is the kind of look you're going for.

584
00:44:43.208 --> 00:44:45.458
Know what happens
when you get burned like that?

585
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:47.291
<i>Your brain goes into shock.</i>

586
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:51.291
<i>I'm teaching you to fight through it.</i>

587
00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:56.375
<i>Fight through the fear.</i>
<i>Fight through the pain.</i>

588
00:44:56.458 --> 00:44:59.458
<i>You master that.</i>
<i>and you'll never lose again. son.</i>

589
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.250
Cover that up. by the way.

590
00:45:03.041 --> 00:45:04.416
<i>We don't need your mom seeing that.</i>

591
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.833
<i>Voilà.</i>

592
00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:14.541
-Already?
-Oh. yeah.

593
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:18.000
With this setup.
I could read the Pope's diary

594
00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:20.541
if I wanted to.

595
00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:22.916
-Uh-huh.
-Which I don't.

596
00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:29.500
Uh. what. um. great nation
would you like to hail from?

597
00:45:29.583 --> 00:45:32.541
Denmark. New Zealand. Japan?

598
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.250
Non-extradition and palm trees
would be nice.

599
00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:40.291
You want Ecuador.
Have you been there?

600
00:45:40.875 --> 00:45:42.750
They have this. uh. this drink there.

601
00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:44.750
It's called the. uh. the <i>pinonilo.</i>

602
00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:45.916
<i>Pinolillo.</i>

603
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.958
And it's…
They serve it with. uh. with honey.

604
00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:50.166
Let me see the passport.

605
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.916
Yeah. With a very unselfish…
There you are…

606
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Splash of honey.

607
00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:57.500
And it's. uh… It's a must.

608
00:45:58.666 --> 00:46:00.041
You cleaned up very well.

609
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.708
Like I said. I'm in a hurry.

610
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:03.833
Uh. you can stand over there.

611
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:08.916
Uh. you need an alias.

612
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.541
And it has to be
something very. very easy to forget.

613
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:14.041
You can step on the rug.

614
00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:17.541
Something like. you know. John. Joe.

615
00:46:17.625 --> 00:46:21.708
Juan Pablo is also a very common name
in Ecuador.

616
00:46:21.791 --> 00:46:23.000
It has to…

617
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.333
It has to disappear
into the wash of the hippocampus.

618
00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:30.875
Right between lunch and dinner.

619
00:46:30.958 --> 00:46:32.333
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

620
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:33.833
I'm all talked out. all right?

621
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:35.291
-Take the picture.
-Sure.

622
00:46:35.375 --> 00:46:39.666
-Unless the desired response is emotion.

623
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.250
Like. you know. hope. anger. fear.

624
00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:46.708
Can you give a step towards me. please?

625
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:48.916
One step.

626
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:52.125
Yes. that's good.

627
00:46:53.208 --> 00:46:55.750
The only problem with that sort of alias

628
00:46:55.833 --> 00:47:00.125
is that emotional memory
has staying power.

629
00:47:00.916 --> 00:47:04.708
You know all about notoriety. don't you?

630
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.541
All right.

631
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.000
Trapdoor. Unexpected.

632
00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:34.625
-Someone is very upset with you. man.

633
00:47:37.791 --> 00:47:39.750
Well. now I'm upset with them.

634
00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:46.083
A five and seven zeros' worth.

635
00:47:48.541 --> 00:47:49.833
Unh-unh.

636
00:47:53.958 --> 00:47:54.833
Hey!

637
00:47:57.666 --> 00:47:59.291
-Smile.

638
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:21.166
-They don't usually come this attractive.
-That's called harassment.

639
00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:23.208
If you think that's harassment. buckle up.

640
00:48:26.333 --> 00:48:29.791
Tell me. what was your first clue
Sierra Six was gonna break procedure?

641
00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:31.166
When he didn't show at the exfil.

642
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.958
Not when he chased the target
across a flotilla?

643
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:36.541
Six did his job until he didn't.

644
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.041
He intentionally blew an op

645
00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:39.833
that was prepped
to be executed at distance.

646
00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:41.125
I know. I prepped it.

647
00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:43.458
And that whole time.
you had no reason to believe

648
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.416
he had another agenda beside the op?

649
00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:47.708
No.

650
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:50.791
Let's talk life goals. officer.

651
00:48:50.875 --> 00:48:55.416
I went from Harvard. to analysis.
to the DO's desk in eight years.

652
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.250
It's never been done before. I did it.

653
00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:02.541
I did it by not allowing
the weakness of others to drag me down.

654
00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:05.916
Sierra Six stole an asset
of considerable value to the agency.

655
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.750
If you had any idea this was coming
and you withheld it.

656
00:49:08.833 --> 00:49:14.458
your life goals. should you have any.
would suffer incalculable damage.

657
00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:17.500
I never even met Six
until I landed in Bangkok.

658
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.166
And no one said anything
about a retrieval. What's the asset?

659
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.208
-Do you know where Six is?
-No.

660
00:49:33.166 --> 00:49:34.166
Open that file.

661
00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.375
In a career spanning two decades.

662
00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:43.125
that's everything we have
on your partner Six.

663
00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:55.958
They found him.

664
00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.916
Who's the closest to him?

665
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:00.833
We are.

666
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.500
What do you know about the Sierra program?

667
00:50:05.583 --> 00:50:07.833
Reckless mystery men you guys send in

668
00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:10.000
when you can't officially send
anyone else.

669
00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:11.416
The gray men.

670
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.916
Your predecessor's idea.

671
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.833
<i>He founded a program</i>
<i>to recruit hardened criminals.</i>

672
00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:19.500
<i>commuting their sentences in exchange</i>
<i>for a lifelong commitment to the agency.</i>

673
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.666
<i>Assets were chosen for their skill set.</i>
<i>lack of family. and plausible deniability.</i>

674
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:30.500
<i>Identities permanently destroyed.</i>
<i>Nameless assassins with limited morality.</i>

675
00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:33.333
I mean.
what could possibly go wrong. right?

676
00:50:35.166 --> 00:50:38.000
Every single Sierra flamed out.

677
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:42.916
All dead or back in prison.

678
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:48.333
<i>Six is the last of the dirty half dozen.</i>
<i>and he is 100% conforming to pattern.</i>

679
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:51.000
He hurts people

680
00:50:51.666 --> 00:50:53.291
because that's who he is.

681
00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:56.166
That's who you're protecting.

682
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.291
Remove yourself from my personal space.

683
00:51:03.208 --> 00:51:04.208
Please.

684
00:51:11.291 --> 00:51:14.250
Officer. I have reason to believe
you're not being truthful in this debrief.

685
00:51:14.333 --> 00:51:16.875
And as such. I must recommend
you be suspended from field duty.

686
00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:18.041
I wanna talk to my COS.

687
00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:19.791
I already did.
She's lost confidence in you.

688
00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:21.791
-Am I jarring your memory yet?

689
00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:33.875
We need to ground in Vienna.

690
00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.833
We haven't filed a flight plan.
They'll never clear us.

691
00:51:36.916 --> 00:51:38.291
So declare an emergency.

692
00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.583
There are weapons on board.
I'll lose my license.

693
00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:44.916
We have a filed alternate near Budapest.
Best I can do is call them.

694
00:51:48.125 --> 00:51:49.916
How do you feel about your license?

695
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.958
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
This is November Three…

696
00:51:54.041 --> 00:51:55.916
Who's up for some <i>Tafelspitz</i>?

697
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.541
Stick around the building.

698
00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:06.833
The boys aren't done
searching your apartment yet.

699
00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:13.666
I would have opened it.

700
00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.333
Where's the target?

701
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.666
Where's my money?

702
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.041
He got caught in the well.

703
00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:29.625
Come on. man.

704
00:54:29.708 --> 00:54:31.000
Hey. sunshine.

705
00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:34.333
-You must be Lloyd.
-What gave it away?

706
00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:36.875
The white pants. the trash 'stache.
It just…

707
00:54:37.458 --> 00:54:39.583
-It leans Lloyd.

708
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.208
Where's the drive?

709
00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:44.625
I got it here somewhere.
It's just hard to see.

710
00:54:45.291 --> 00:54:47.375
-Is that it?

711
00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:51.166
Ballsy.

712
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:15.791
Nice try. pumpkin.

713
00:55:16.375 --> 00:55:17.416
What size shoe are you?

714
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.750
-Why? You want my foot in your ass?

715
00:55:19.833 --> 00:55:21.583
Ah. shit!

716
00:55:24.708 --> 00:55:25.666
Mother--

717
00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:32.541
Looks like an 11.

718
00:55:33.583 --> 00:55:34.833
Who's this lunatic?

719
00:55:34.916 --> 00:55:36.666
I don't know. <i>Lloyd</i>.

720
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.583
-Let's go.
-I'm good.

721
00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:40.500
Let's go.

722
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.416
It sounded like a question.

723
00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:48.500
-How'd you find me?
-You make a lot of noise.

724
00:55:48.583 --> 00:55:49.666
Hey.

725
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:50.875
Open it.

726
00:55:58.708 --> 00:56:00.291
-Not the trunk.
-Get in.

727
00:56:00.375 --> 00:56:02.458
I could really use a comfortable chair
right now.

728
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:48.041
Is that Donald Fitzroy?

729
00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:50.041
What the hell are you doing?

730
00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:53.291
Suzanne! Long time.
If I'm honest. I liked your old haircut.

731
00:56:53.375 --> 00:56:54.916
Where you didn't look like a bitch.

732
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.166
We did not give you permission

733
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.375
to kidnap former CIA personnel
and their family members.

734
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:01.625
You've been hired
by the agency to recover–

735
00:57:01.708 --> 00:57:03.833
To do <i>your </i>job because <i>you </i>couldn't.

736
00:57:03.916 --> 00:57:05.416
Can someone get me a Vicodin. please?

737
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.541
-So where is Six?
-Where I want him.

738
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:10.291
-In the wind?
-On the run. scared shitless.

739
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:13.125
This is ten years of my work
on the line here. Lloyd--

740
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.666
I am your only prayer
of getting that drive back

741
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.500
because I can do
everything the agency can't.

742
00:57:20.583 --> 00:57:24.125
You know all those rules you guys
are always trying to work your way around?

743
00:57:24.208 --> 00:57:26.208
They don't mean dick to me.

744
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:29.166
So unless you want our names
spilled across every news alert

745
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.125
on every phone in every pocket on Earth.

746
00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:33.708
shut up and go sit in the corner.

747
00:57:37.291 --> 00:57:39.375
-Oh.

748
00:57:39.458 --> 00:57:40.583
How about that?

749
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.000
Forget about the Vicodin.

750
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:46.958
Why are you walking like that?

751
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:49.375
'Cause I got shot
in the ass. Suzanne!

752
00:57:52.833 --> 00:57:54.083
Hey. sweetheart.

753
00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:03.791
-I'm so sorry.

754
00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:05.000
I know. honey.

755
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.000
I'm sorry.

756
00:58:25.791 --> 00:58:27.625
-You look like shit.

757
00:58:28.416 --> 00:58:30.333
That's the most sleep I've had
in 36 hours.

758
00:58:30.416 --> 00:58:32.083
They pulled me from field duty.

759
00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:35.541
They think I'm into whatever you're into.
You're gonna tell them I'm not.

760
00:58:35.625 --> 00:58:37.541
What gives the impression
they care what I think?

761
00:58:37.625 --> 00:58:39.625
This is my career. you understand?

762
00:58:40.291 --> 00:58:44.375
You're just an asset.
but it's my career. my reputation.

763
00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:45.500
What did you steal?

764
00:58:45.583 --> 00:58:48.166
Technically. I didn't steal anything.
Four gave it to me.

765
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.083
-Then why didn't you give it to HQ?
-Well. he gave it to me.

766
00:58:51.166 --> 00:58:53.416
-What did he give you?
-An encrypted drive.

767
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.416
What's on it?

768
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.416
It's encrypted.

769
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.833
-I wanna see it.
-I don't have it.

770
00:58:56.916 --> 00:58:59.041
-Where is it?
-How do I know I can trust you?

771
00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:01.208
Because I just saved your life.

772
00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:03.875
That's a fair point.

773
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.416
I sent it to Margaret Cahill.
the U.K. Agency Chief. okay?

774
00:59:09.166 --> 00:59:11.125
She retired and lives in Prague.

775
00:59:14.625 --> 00:59:15.500
What are you thinking?

776
00:59:15.583 --> 00:59:18.708
-I'm thinking about what to do.
-Maybe think about it this way.

777
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:20.708
They already had me kill an agent.

778
00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:23.041
Now it's my turn.
How do you know you're not next?

779
00:59:28.916 --> 00:59:30.250
Get comfortable.

780
00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:36.083
"Get comfortable"
like we're going to Prague.

781
00:59:36.166 --> 00:59:38.708
or… or. like. jail comfortable?

782
00:59:49.291 --> 00:59:51.250
Where are we? What do we got?

783
00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:52.958
Wet teams en route.

784
00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:56.375
Everybody be advised. he has help.

785
00:59:56.958 --> 00:59:57.791
We sure?

786
00:59:57.875 --> 01:00:00.666
Well. I didn't tranq myself in the ass.
so yes.

787
01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:05.916
Got something.
CCTV in Bangkok. Night of the op.

788
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:09.791
He ditched the asset.

789
01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:12.583
-Where's that package now?
-It's already in the system.

790
01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:15.000
Resolution's too shitty
to read the address.

791
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:17.291
Clerk said it was to a PO box in Prague.

792
01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:19.708
He doesn't keep any records.
so that's the best we got.

793
01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:22.250
That'll do. pig. That'll do.

794
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.708
Goldilocks. would you be a lamb
and excuse us?

795
01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:27.625
Go to hell.

796
01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.125
Hey! Whoa! Stop!

797
01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:31.250
-She has a pacemaker. jackass!
-Hey. whoa!

798
01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:32.791
Get off me! No! Stop!

799
01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.333
Then she definitely shouldn't stick around
for this next part.

800
01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:37.958
If you hurt her. I will annihilate you.

801
01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:40.416
-Do you understand me?

802
01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:44.000
-Please.

803
01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:53.291
Who's in Prague?

804
01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.000
There's three million people in Prague.
I don't know all their names.

805
01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.166
Right. Well. you see.
your boy mailed a package.

806
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:01.583
which means.
with countless contacts at his disposal.

807
01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:04.458
and this being
a particularly challenging situation.

808
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:08.250
there's someone in Prague
that he trusts the most.

809
01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:14.750
Who is that?

810
01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:15.750
It's your mother.

811
01:01:15.833 --> 01:01:16.666
Boring.

812
01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:27.625
Happy?

813
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.208
Now. whatever I just did to your ears.
it's not even torture.

814
01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:36.041
I just made it up on the spot.
Just came to me.

815
01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.541
-Oh.
-And that's how this is gonna go.

816
01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:00.208
-Who's in Prague?
-Nobody.

817
01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.166
Boring.

818
01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:15.166
-Should we try again?
-Okay. fine.

819
01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:19.833
Who's in Prague?

820
01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:22.375
-I already told you. I don't know.
-Boring.

821
01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:36.041
Maybe we should get the girl back in here.

822
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.333
Yes.

823
01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.333
<i>Have you tried aluminum siding?</i>

824
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.875
I prefer fiberglass.

825
01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:41.791
At least you don't have to paint.

826
01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:43.208
<i>You're Berlin Station.</i>

827
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:46.291
<i>Until this morning.</i>

828
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.583
<i>I'm here with Six.</i>

829
01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:49.541
Where is he?

830
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:51.708
<i>The trunk.</i>

831
01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:53.208
Well played.

832
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.208
You did say you were gonna quit.

833
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.750
It was a life of few pleasures.

834
01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:09.583
I clung to the ones I had.

835
01:04:09.666 --> 01:04:11.250
-"Was"?
-Three months.

836
01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:12.708
Optimistic.

837
01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.708
If you utter
anything remotely sympathetic.

838
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:17.958
I will shoot you.

839
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.166
Okay.

840
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:31.000
Have you been well enough
to check your mail lately?

841
01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.208
I have.

842
01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.000
You get in?

843
01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.541
I always get in.

844
01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:44.458
Looks like Sierra Four got his hands
on Denny Carmichael's dirty laundry.

845
01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:49.083
-Assassination. torture. bombings.

846
01:04:49.166 --> 01:04:50.666
All unsanctioned

847
01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.416
with no regard for collateral damage.

848
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.083
This is why
Carmichael pushed me and Fitz out.

849
01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:59.916
This is why you are on a ledge. Six.

850
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.291
He's using the agency
as his own personal hit squad.

851
01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.208
What's he getting out of all this?

852
01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:07.583
This is
shadow government stuff.

853
01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:10.416
which. bluntly.
it is above Carmichael's pay grade.

854
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.916
Guardian angel?

855
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.250
At least one.

856
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.708
Pushing him up the ladder.
covering his tracks.

857
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:19.333
Somebody very powerful
is pulling the strings.

858
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:22.500
How was Sierra Four involved?

859
01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:23.583
Blackmail.

860
01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:26.083
Four was always a hustler.

861
01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:30.791
Looks like he found out about Carmichael.
got ahold of some evidence.

862
01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:33.208
tried selling it to the highest bidder.

863
01:05:33.708 --> 01:05:37.750
Carmichael got wind of it
and used Six to take him out.

864
01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:39.250
Big mistake.

865
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.416
<i> Do not underestimate this target.</i>

866
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.625
Hit this meatball like a freight train.

867
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.250
And turn on cams.

868
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.083
I want this pay-per-view.

869
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.208
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>we can copy the file?</i>

870
01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:58.833
It's a dead disk.
You copy it. you encrypt the encryption.

871
01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:00.750
Then we have to leak it to the press.

872
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.541
Wait until I find Fitz
and the kid. would you?

873
01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:04.916
There's a kid?

874
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.541
Fitzroy's niece.

875
01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:11.791
But look. you've done more than enough.
Just find cover. This is on me.

876
01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:17.666
I wouldn't recommend it.
but if you insist on a rescue mission…

877
01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:20.166
My bug-out car.

878
01:06:20.666 --> 01:06:23.000
It's bulletproof. loaded trunk.

879
01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:26.750
Stashed in a garage in the city center.
Address is on the tag.

880
01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:28.291
Hey. inmate.

881
01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.375
Thanks for proving us right.

882
01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.833
I thought we weren't getting sentimental.

883
01:06:33.916 --> 01:06:34.916
We're not.

884
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.291
Go.

885
01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.583
Okay. get in.

886
01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:29.166
Lead. Lead.
Light's on the left. I can't see.

887
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.166
Go!

888
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.750
Don't do this. Maggie.
Open the door!

889
01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:37.958
-Open the door.
-Quiet.

890
01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:54.750
<i>In here.</i>

891
01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:04.208
In here.

892
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:07.916
In here!

893
01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:09.625
Hands up.

894
01:08:11.791 --> 01:08:13.833
-Where is he?
-Where is who?

895
01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:18.000
-<i>Do not play with me.</i>
-What the hell is she doing?

896
01:08:18.083 --> 01:08:19.250
<i>Oh. doll.</i>

897
01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:22.291
whatever they are paying you.

898
01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:25.291
it is not enough.

899
01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:28.375
Oh. shi--

900
01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:44.666
Jesus.

901
01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:47.500
Well. that was unexpected.

902
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:49.875
Did we just kill Margaret Cahill?

903
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:24.291
We have Alpha and Bravo teams circling.

904
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:26.958
Delta's en route. Cameras aren't live yet.

905
01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:30.458
Send everyone.
Get 'em in there. every team. Light it up.

906
01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:07.875
Cops have him near the square
at the opera house.

907
01:10:07.958 --> 01:10:09.166
They've called in a SWAT team.

908
01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:18.416
Hey. stop it!
Don't move. okay? Stay still.

909
01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:25.750
Alpha team arriving now.

910
01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:27.166
This clown's a sitting duck.

911
01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:30.125
You have my permission
to shoot anyone standing in his way.

912
01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:39.250
Confirmation on target.

913
01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:40.708
Make him dead.

914
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:43.541
-You should clear the square.
-Shut up.

915
01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:47.291
-You should clear the square.
-I told you to shut up.

916
01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:20.583
We're going to prison for this.

917
01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:22.583
Keep any more cops out of that square.

918
01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:25.041
We're killing cops now?
Margaret Cahill wasn't enough?

919
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.875
SWAT team approaching
from the bridge. Multiple vehicles.

920
01:11:33.958 --> 01:11:35.541
Six is in the southwest corner.

921
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.541
Get Bravo team in there.
We need more guns.

922
01:11:57.541 --> 01:11:59.000
Bravo engaging now.

923
01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:14.208
Bravo. SWAT on your flank.
Watch the fire from that heavy gun.

924
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:28.625
Would someone mind shooting
the man handcuffed to the bench?

925
01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:30.000
We can't get to him.

926
01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:32.583
<i>There's too many cops.</i>

927
01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:57.250
My God. how hard is it to shoot somebody?

928
01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.458
Take out that assault vehicle.

929
01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:13.291
This is insane.

930
01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:16.791
Lloyd. please. pull everyone out now.

931
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.333
Lloyd!

932
01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:21.875
Extra ten million to the first guy
to put a bullet in this Ken Doll's brain.

933
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:49.416
What happened?

934
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.416
The relay antenna must have snapped off.

935
01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.500
Well. get it back on

936
01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:57.083
before I beat you to death
with that keyboard.

937
01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:03.541
Anybody got eyes on him?

938
01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:07.583
Negative. negative. We lost him.

939
01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:19.875
He's on the tram!

940
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.250
Delta team's in pursuit.

941
01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:12.875
Jump!

942
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.166
Thanks.

943
01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:15.416
<i>All teams. report status.</i>

944
01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:20.666
All teams. report status.

945
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.291
This is quite possibly
the most spectacular failure

946
01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:26.875
in the history of covert ops.

947
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:32.541
This will be taught in schools
as the primary example

948
01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:36.458
of exactly what not to do
in asset retrieval.

949
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.000
<i>This is Lone Wolf. Over.</i>

950
01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:46.541
Hello. my sexy Tamil friend.

951
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.208
Sit rep?

952
01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.541
<i>Tracking the target.</i>

953
01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:51.375
No change. Lone Wolf.

954
01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.000
Get me that asset.

955
01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:00.333
What I do can't be taught.

956
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.041
You hurt?

957
01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:16.541
I mean. my ego's a little bruised.

958
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:19.708
I would like the opportunity
to save you at some point.

959
01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:23.125
Not that I want you to be in danger
so I can save you.

960
01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:25.875
-You said they have a girl.
-Yeah.

961
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.458
How do we find her?

962
01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:31.166
She's got a pacemaker.

963
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:33.375
You don't have a handcuff key. do you?

964
01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.208
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

965
01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:48.458
Can you please get us a doctor?
My husband's injured.

966
01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:50.958
-You have to wait in the lobby.
-No. we have been waiting.

967
01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:53.291
-I'm sorry.
-I need someone to see him now.

968
01:19:53.375 --> 01:19:54.208
I understand.

969
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:56.083
How much longer
do we need to wait?

970
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.000
You know. you have ten fingers.

971
01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:24.833
Yeah. and a few cans of pepper spray
in my eyes.

972
01:20:24.916 --> 01:20:29.583
And you can't all caps on this thing.
You have to control shift. It's a process.

973
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:33.708
There.

974
01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:34.958
She's in Croatia.

975
01:20:35.666 --> 01:20:37.208
I mean. I can see that.

976
01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:39.666
It's not in Croatian.

977
01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:42.625
We need a ride. I call not trunk.

978
01:21:00.166 --> 01:21:01.166
And you are?

979
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:03.583
Give it to me.

980
01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.458
-You wanna go first?

981
01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:08.500
You go.

982
01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:31.708
Help. Help me.

983
01:22:31.791 --> 01:22:33.833
That's him.
the man from the square.

984
01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.625
He's trying to kill me. He's got a gun.

985
01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.250
-Okay. okay. okay. okay. okay.

986
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:42.083
-Okay. okay.

987
01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:02.583
Hey! Give me the gun.

988
01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:33.125
Get down!

989
01:23:39.416 --> 01:23:40.625
You were in my shot.

990
01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:42.958
You gave me an empty gun?

991
01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:45.625
-The shells were coming. okay?
-Huh?

992
01:23:45.708 --> 01:23:47.916
The shells were coming.
You… You ran away too fast.

993
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.333
Then you need to say.
"Hey. wait! That's empty."

994
01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:51.375
No. it's assumed.

995
01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:54.333
I assumed it's loaded.
so I ran after the guy.

996
01:23:54.416 --> 01:23:56.875
-Who throws a loaded gun?
-I asked for a loaded gun.

997
01:23:56.958 --> 01:24:00.666
No one throws a loaded weapon. okay?
Are you coming?

998
01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:04.666
I'm gonna bleed out
while we have this conversation.

999
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:07.333
Can we just unpack this somewhere else?

1000
01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:13.750
<i>Jesus Christ. Suzanne!</i>

1001
01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.291
I warned you.

1002
01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:17.375
When I said. "Sit on Lloyd."
I meant sit on him.

1003
01:24:17.458 --> 01:24:18.625
not "torch half of Europe."

1004
01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:20.833
<i>-He is unsittable.</i>
Do you have the drive?

1005
01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:22.583
Not in possession. No. it's en route.

1006
01:24:22.666 --> 01:24:23.625
What about Six?

1007
01:24:23.708 --> 01:24:25.625
<i>Bleeding and MIA.</i>

1008
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:28.750
-Have you heard from the old man?
<i>-No. not yet.</i>

1009
01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:32.875
Doesn't mean he doesn't know.
"Prague on fire" is hard to keep a lid on.

1010
01:24:32.958 --> 01:24:34.125
<i>What are you gonna tell him?</i>

1011
01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:35.541
The truth. Suzanne.

1012
01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:37.458
<i>That </i>you<i> hired Lloyd Hansen?</i>

1013
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.875
That truth or some other truth?

1014
01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.625
Call me the minute you get the drive.

1015
01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:49.666
What are you doing?

1016
01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:06.875
I'm just gonna pack it and wrap it.

1017
01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:08.416
and we can go.

1018
01:25:09.583 --> 01:25:12.375
EpiPens.

1019
01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:18.458
Good news is
he missed the liver and the kidney.

1020
01:25:19.625 --> 01:25:20.625
Amateur.

1021
01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:24.541
Why'd you go to prison?

1022
01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:26.458
Why do you ask?

1023
01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:28.000
'Cause I wanna know.

1024
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:31.250
Will it affect
whether you help me or not?

1025
01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:32.291
Maybe.

1026
01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.500
That's fair enough.

1027
01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:36.875
What is this. puppy mouthwash?

1028
01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:41.708
Okay.

1029
01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:50.958
Well…

1030
01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:55.666
…my father fancied himself
a real macho man.

1031
01:25:58.166 --> 01:26:03.958
And he was hell-bent on turning me
and my brother into the same.

1032
01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:11.750
Unfortunately. his methods
were a little unsound.

1033
01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:14.208
and. uh…

1034
01:26:15.916 --> 01:26:20.125
he started laying into my brother so hard

1035
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:22.833
that at a certain point.

1036
01:26:23.916 --> 01:26:26.416
it was clear
it was either gonna be my brother or him.

1037
01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:29.291
<i>So…</i>

1038
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.125
You think you can do it without me?

1039
01:26:32.208 --> 01:26:33.625
You can't!

1040
01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:36.708
I decided it would be him.

1041
01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:44.125
I thought. "How noble of me."

1042
01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:49.125
and. uh.
everyone else thought I should be in jail.

1043
01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.208
And that's the way it was
until Fitzroy found me.

1044
01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:12.583
That's better.

1045
01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:19.291
So what do you say?

1046
01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:24.125
We gonna do this or not?

1047
01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.041
He's coming for us. isn't he?

1048
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:37.500
If he can walk. honey. it'll be
through those double doors over there.

1049
01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:51.250
-<i>Vehicle on approach.</i>

1050
01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:52.250
Let him in.

1051
01:27:58.125 --> 01:27:59.208
Alpha one. clear.

1052
01:28:08.291 --> 01:28:10.291
<i>Bravo un. rien à signaler.</i>

1053
01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:14.583
<i>Charles trois.</i> clear.

1054
01:28:20.791 --> 01:28:22.375
You know what I love about you?

1055
01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:26.041
You look like you've been hit by a bus.
but it only adds to your mystique.

1056
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500
Yahtzee.

1057
01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:40.083
<i>Secteur cinq. RAS.</i>

1058
01:28:42.208 --> 01:28:43.708
<i>-Alors ?</i>
-<i>Tout est en place.</i>

1059
01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:46.000
<i>-Eh. à cause de--</i>
-You guys looking for me?

1060
01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.458
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1061
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:49.625
<i>Bouge pas ! Bouge pas !</i>

1062
01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:50.791
<i>À genoux !</i>

1063
01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:52.416
All right. all right. you got me.

1064
01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.750
-<i>Mets-toi à genoux !</i>
Quick question.

1065
01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:56.916
You a 42 regular?

1066
01:29:03.875 --> 01:29:06.291
If you're gonna take his gun.
make sure it's loaded.

1067
01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:15.708
I get the big one.

1068
01:29:19.916 --> 01:29:20.750
It's loading.

1069
01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:26.458
Tell me. Suzanne. is there any other part
of your job that I can do for you?

1070
01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:29.125
Failing upwards
does not qualify as success.

1071
01:29:29.208 --> 01:29:31.458
No. success qualifies as success.

1072
01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:34.791
Do you consider putting a bullet
in the girl upstairs a success?

1073
01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:37.708
'Cause I'm struggling to see
how you're gonna get out of all this.

1074
01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:40.041
You wanna make an omelet.
you gotta kill some people.

1075
01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:41.708
You're killing a girl?

1076
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:49.583
You know. in English.
we call this a happy ending.

1077
01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:53.416
However. if you say one more word.
you may not see it that way.

1078
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.041
Suzanne. please pay my Tamil friend
and send him on his way.

1079
01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.666
Who's on the east perimeter?

1080
01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:00.166
Unit five.

1081
01:30:01.333 --> 01:30:02.250
Where are they?

1082
01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:03.875
They were there two minutes ago.

1083
01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:07.791
Get the genny up.

1084
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:28.250
Lock everything down.

1085
01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:30.208
All units to the courtyard.

1086
01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:33.958
And do not pay this asshole.

1087
01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:43.375
<i>Destruction du portail.</i>
<i>Intrusion. Intrusion.</i>

1088
01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:54.166
What's happening?

1089
01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:55.916
I told you to stay over there. please.

1090
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.458
-What's going on?

1091
01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:58.916
Under the bed. quick!

1092
01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:26.833
Attaboy.

1093
01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:30.541
Fitz.

1094
01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:32.375
Get me eyes on the bridge.

1095
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.916
Ahh!

1096
01:31:47.416 --> 01:31:49.500
He's trying to draw us away. Shit!

1097
01:31:50.083 --> 01:31:50.958
You able?

1098
01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:55.208
Well. I can walk. but. uh. missing a wing.

1099
01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:59.166
-Can you wiggle your finger?
-With this wing.

1100
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.000
That'll do. You okay?

1101
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:06.000
Took you long enough.

1102
01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:10.500
-Sorry about that. My flight was delayed.
-I knew you'd catch another one.

1103
01:32:14.375 --> 01:32:15.916
Put these in your ears.

1104
01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:29.458
You ready?

1105
01:32:48.916 --> 01:32:50.000
He's in the house.

1106
01:32:53.083 --> 01:32:54.416
Morons!

1107
01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:01.458
-Alpha team. check in.

1108
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:02.458
All elements check in.

1109
01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:04.750
-Put a gun on that door.
-Roger that.

1110
01:33:05.958 --> 01:33:08.041
-Check the network.
-It's unresponsive.

1111
01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:12.083
Get the cameras back on.

1112
01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:16.791
I had to reboot the system.

1113
01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:19.000
-Mine is not rebooting.
-Mine's unresponsive.

1114
01:33:25.791 --> 01:33:26.875
Shit!

1115
01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:35.541
Okay.

1116
01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:45.875
Do you have a plan. or are we improvising?

1117
01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:48.125
Yeah. I got a plan.
You got your swim trunks?

1118
01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:54.208
Go. go. go.

1119
01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:58.000
-Down. Down low.

1120
01:33:58.083 --> 01:34:01.250
You're making me destroy
a historic building here!

1121
01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:03.000
All right. Let's get ready to jump.

1122
01:34:03.083 --> 01:34:05.625
-I'm gonna have to take the stairs.
-What are you talking about?

1123
01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:08.708
-Not good.

1124
01:34:08.791 --> 01:34:11.125
-What the hell is that?
-What do you think it is?

1125
01:34:12.166 --> 01:34:14.208
-Go. Six. Get her out of here.

1126
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:25.666
Take the gun.
Give me the grenade.

1127
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:28.041
-Let me see it. Put some pressure on it.

1128
01:34:28.125 --> 01:34:30.583
Get the damn gun out of my face.
Shut up. I need to think.

1129
01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.125
You don't have time to think.

1130
01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.875
Six. look at me. Look at me.

1131
01:34:33.958 --> 01:34:34.875
I'm out.

1132
01:34:34.958 --> 01:34:36.125
Get her gone.

1133
01:34:37.291 --> 01:34:40.958
Take this. Give me a hand grenade.
You understand me? Go!

1134
01:34:47.166 --> 01:34:49.333
-Come on.
-You go with Six. baby.

1135
01:34:49.416 --> 01:34:51.666
-We go in three. two. one.
-No. wait!

1136
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.958
-He's bleeding. Oh. my God!
-Come on.

1137
01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:56.583
-I love you. Go with Six.
-No!

1138
01:34:56.666 --> 01:34:58.750
-Not you too!
-Go. go. go. go. Take her.

1139
01:34:58.833 --> 01:35:00.958
-It's okay.
-No. Six. stop!

1140
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:02.750
Stop it! Stop!

1141
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.750
Six. please!

1142
01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:06.916
Oh. for Chrissakes.

1143
01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:49.625
Roll him.

1144
01:35:52.791 --> 01:35:53.708
Boring.

1145
01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:56.250
-You douche.

1146
01:35:59.541 --> 01:36:03.875
-No! No!
-Come on.

1147
01:37:23.333 --> 01:37:24.250
Take it.

1148
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:26.916
I don't care about the money anymore.

1149
01:37:28.833 --> 01:37:31.458
These are not honorable people. Take it.

1150
01:37:49.833 --> 01:37:50.875
Stay down.

1151
01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.375
Shoot him!

1152
01:38:27.458 --> 01:38:30.125
Wait. Please don't shoot.

1153
01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:33.916
Look what you did to my hand.
Give me that. you little shit.

1154
01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:37.750
No!

1155
01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:40.416
-No! No!

1156
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.666
No!

1157
01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:27.458
-Hey. hey!

1158
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:30.416
Now you pick those feet up.
or you're gonna get dead real quick.

1159
01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:44.875
Now. listen.

1160
01:39:46.166 --> 01:39:48.666
You shut up. and you don't move.

1161
01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:17.750
Six!

1162
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:30.000
Now. I'm gonna stop you
right there. cupcake.

1163
01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:31.916
What do you say we wrap this up?

1164
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:33.791
I mean. I'm having a blast.

1165
01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:36.833
but it's way past the kid's bedtime.
don't you think?

1166
01:40:37.458 --> 01:40:40.708
Keep him talking. I have line of sight.

1167
01:40:41.291 --> 01:40:45.625
You're gonna throw me that gun.
or the little one gets a new face.

1168
01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:49.291
If your strategy relies
on whether or not I'll kill a child.

1169
01:40:49.375 --> 01:40:50.791
you need a new strategy.

1170
01:41:00.291 --> 01:41:02.750
Cute. I meant with the bullets.

1171
01:41:03.875 --> 01:41:05.458
Nobody throws a loaded gun. Lloyd.

1172
01:41:06.666 --> 01:41:08.833
You know. I think
we would have been friends. you and I.

1173
01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:11.875
Aside from your childish sense of morality
and eight-dollar haircut.

1174
01:41:11.958 --> 01:41:12.916
we have a lot in common.

1175
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.541
It's really a shame
this isn't gonna work out between us.

1176
01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.583
Now normally at this point in the night.
I wouldn't be sticking around.

1177
01:41:20.166 --> 01:41:21.708
With the house lights about to come on.

1178
01:41:21.791 --> 01:41:24.791
I'd find a desperate. ugly chick
to lick my wounds and split.

1179
01:41:24.875 --> 01:41:27.875
but you have been a pebble in my shoe
since the very beginning.

1180
01:41:30.416 --> 01:41:32.458
And now I just don't think
I can walk away.

1181
01:41:36.416 --> 01:41:38.083
Guess what I'm thinking right now.

1182
01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:39.916
That you've overshared.

1183
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.750
I think I'm better than you.

1184
01:41:42.333 --> 01:41:44.666
What do you say. Six. you wanna dance?

1185
01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:54.750
Push him right. and I'll have the shot.

1186
01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:57.875
-Forget the shot. Come get the kid.

1187
01:41:57.958 --> 01:41:59.083
Let me see your face.

1188
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.291
My friend's gonna meet you
at the edge of the maze. okay?

1189
01:42:07.375 --> 01:42:08.916
-No. no. wait.
-Yeah.

1190
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.083
Wait. I'm not just gonna leave you here
with him. He's crazy.

1191
01:42:12.166 --> 01:42:14.416
-I got this.
-No. no. I'm gonna take you with me.

1192
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:15.791
Just come with me. please.

1193
01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:17.083
-Claire.
-Don't leave me alone.

1194
01:42:17.166 --> 01:42:19.291
-Please.
-Claire. Claire.

1195
01:42:19.375 --> 01:42:21.958
-You're all I have.
-Claire. Claire.

1196
01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:23.125
-Claire.

1197
01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:25.541
This is just another Thursday.

1198
01:42:27.166 --> 01:42:28.000
Go.

1199
01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:42.833
Kick his ass.

1200
01:43:25.041 --> 01:43:26.708
Do you miss your fingers. Lloyd?

1201
01:43:27.458 --> 01:43:28.916
Still getting used to it.

1202
01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:39.708
Damn! That stings!

1203
01:44:09.708 --> 01:44:11.333
Let's see if these moves fuck.

1204
01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:05.916
Don't ever talk back to me.
you understand?

1205
01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:08.000
-Ever.

1206
01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:13.875
I will end you.

1207
01:46:31.875 --> 01:46:33.083
And you are?

1208
01:46:37.166 --> 01:46:38.958
-Relax.

1209
01:46:39.041 --> 01:46:39.916
You'll live.

1210
01:46:41.625 --> 01:46:43.458
I just need you compliant.

1211
01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:46.833
Can I comply over there?

1212
01:46:46.916 --> 01:46:48.291
Knock yourself out.

1213
01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:54.083
-I mean. look.

1214
01:46:54.166 --> 01:46:56.541
Lloyd Hansen
was a toxic piece of shit. right?

1215
01:46:56.625 --> 01:46:57.750
Yeah. that's right.

1216
01:46:57.833 --> 01:46:59.875
We have history.

1217
01:47:00.875 --> 01:47:03.666
Me. Denny. Lloyd.
we all went to Harvard together.

1218
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.583
-Those two had this absurd bromance.

1219
01:47:08.708 --> 01:47:09.958
Which made it impossible for me

1220
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:12.541
to prove to Denny
how much of a liability Lloyd was.

1221
01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:15.666
Then I see you two troglodytes
bashing each other.

1222
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:17.708
The whole thing just crystallized.

1223
01:47:21.625 --> 01:47:24.291
Lloyd Hansen
is gonna posthumously take the fall

1224
01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:26.500
for everything that has happened.

1225
01:47:27.166 --> 01:47:28.291
Now. I know how to do that.

1226
01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:31.083
What I need are a few witnesses
to corroborate my story.

1227
01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:34.791
So if you want that girl
to live to a ripe old age.

1228
01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:37.416
you are gonna do
exactly what I tell you to.

1229
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.708
Bad news is
you'll probably get your old cell back.

1230
01:47:39.791 --> 01:47:44.000
but the good news is. if you behave.
I'll let you out to play sometimes.

1231
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.875
'Cause frankly. you are freakishly good
at what you do.

1232
01:47:50.916 --> 01:47:52.833
What? Do you have a question?
What is that?

1233
01:47:54.166 --> 01:47:55.833
Does this plan involve me living?

1234
01:47:55.916 --> 01:47:58.750
-Yes. Yeah. you're gonna live.
-Then we should go.

1235
01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:01.041
Lot of blood.

1236
01:48:05.333 --> 01:48:06.625
Lot of blood.

1237
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:35.750
<i>This will forever be remembered</i>

1238
01:49:35.833 --> 01:49:38.666
<i>as one of the darker chapters</i>
<i>in the history of this agency.</i>

1239
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:45.625
That a rogue independent contractor
as morally dubious as Lloyd Hansen

1240
01:49:45.708 --> 01:49:47.583
could literally steal company resources

1241
01:49:47.666 --> 01:49:51.375
to commit crimes
against our allied partners.

1242
01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:54.625
this is… this is a black eye on all of us.

1243
01:49:55.791 --> 01:49:57.750
I don't know how to defend it.

1244
01:49:59.833 --> 01:50:01.916
However. after much deliberation.

1245
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.291
and based on your corroborative
depiction of events.

1246
01:50:05.375 --> 01:50:07.708
this committee and myself have decided

1247
01:50:07.791 --> 01:50:10.250
to exonerate the three of you
in this affair.

1248
01:50:13.041 --> 01:50:16.416
I don't wanna see you back in here
for quite some time. Is that understood?

1249
01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.875
-Understood.
-Understood. sir.

1250
01:50:20.208 --> 01:50:23.500
-You did the right thing. Good work.
-Thank you. sir. Really.

1251
01:50:28.333 --> 01:50:29.333
Clever girl.

1252
01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:31.125
Stick to the script.

1253
01:50:38.083 --> 01:50:42.458
If anything ever happens
to Claire Fitzroy. deal's off.

1254
01:50:43.916 --> 01:50:45.291
I will come for you.

1255
01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:47.291
Please.

1256
01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:50.791
remove yourself from my personal space.

1257
01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:07.583
-Lunch.

1258
01:51:09.416 --> 01:51:10.250
Let's go.

1259
01:51:11.333 --> 01:51:12.666
Where are they keeping Six?

1260
01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:14.791
Basement. Most secure floor.

1261
01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:16.875
Should've put a bullet in his head.

1262
01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:19.125
He tore through 30
of the best operatives in the world.

1263
01:51:19.208 --> 01:51:20.833
Why would I waste an asset like that?

1264
01:51:20.916 --> 01:51:23.375
He's Fitz's gray man.
He's not gonna do anything you say.

1265
01:51:23.458 --> 01:51:25.791
He will.
As long as I have the girl. he will.

1266
01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:31.250
It is very dangerous
for you to start thinking for yourself.

1267
01:51:31.333 --> 01:51:32.708
You threatened. Denny?

1268
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:35.416
How pleasantly out of character.

1269
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.833
-You rather I be floating in the Potomac?
-I got Lloyd's autopsy report.

1270
01:51:38.916 --> 01:51:40.625
They pulled a nine millimeter
from his chest.

1271
01:51:40.708 --> 01:51:42.916
I told you Six got my gun.

1272
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.833
-Killed Lloyd. left you alive?
-That's right.

1273
01:51:44.916 --> 01:51:47.166
Guess he didn't perceive you as a threat.

1274
01:51:48.958 --> 01:51:50.500
That would be his mistake.

1275
01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:56.000
<i>What's Six's current condition?</i>

1276
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.875
He's been unresponsive the last few days.

1277
01:51:58.958 --> 01:52:00.833
What do you mean "unresponsive"?

1278
01:52:00.916 --> 01:52:03.958
He just lays there.
Can't tell if it's psyops or medical.

1279
01:52:04.041 --> 01:52:06.875
Won't eat. Won't speak.
Won't even look at us.

1280
01:52:06.958 --> 01:52:07.875
Brain damage?

1281
01:52:07.958 --> 01:52:09.583
Nothing shows up on a scan.

1282
01:52:14.833 --> 01:52:15.791
Oh. shit.

1283
01:52:23.791 --> 01:52:25.166
-Clear right.
-Room clear.

1284
01:52:25.833 --> 01:52:29.000
Lock down the perimeter.
Six is a runner. Repeat. Six is a runner.

1285
01:52:29.083 --> 01:52:30.500
-With me.
-Yes. ma'am.

1286
01:52:37.333 --> 01:52:38.708
When do I get to go home?

1287
01:52:43.416 --> 01:52:44.875
I asked you a question.

1288
01:54:02.916 --> 01:54:04.500
Am I allowed to chew gum in here?
