00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:05.846
[both] Whoa!

1097
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:08.391
That's your "I have
a plan" pose.

1098
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.268
So. do you have a plan?

1099
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:13.187
[chuckles nervously]
Please tell me you have a plan.

1100
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:15.732
Yes. If we can make
the basket lighter.

1101
00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:18.484
we might be able to lift
out of the tree.

1102
00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:20.236
How do we do that?

1103
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:22.655
We already tossed
our sandbag.

1104
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:24.073
I'll fire up the burners

1105
00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:26.367
and you look for more weight
to get rid of.

1106
00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:27.660
Got it.

1107
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:31.830
Adios. thing-a-ma-jig.

1108
00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:33.165
[grunting]

1109
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:37.378
Uh...

1110
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.713
[grunts]

1111
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:41.299
[grunts]
Don't know what you are.

1112
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.883
Bye!

1113
00:46:43.635 --> 00:46:45.386
[groaning]

1114
00:46:47.764 --> 00:46:49.432
[loud thud]

1115
00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.183
We're stuck.

1116
00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:54.103
[ropes snapping]

1117
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.773
Uh. not good!

1118
00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.107
Whoa. whoa.

1119
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:02.861
Whoa! Not good!

1120
00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.615
[grunts]
Burner... off!

1121
00:47:06.783 --> 00:47:10.662
[both] Whoa!

1122
00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.831
So. plan B?

1123
00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:24.258
Has anyone seen
Barbie and Skipper?

1124
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.968
[sighs] No one.

1125
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.804
Where are they?

1126
00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:34.977
Uh...uh...uh...

1127
00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:37.271
Um... are we low enough
to jump... maybe?

1128
00:47:39.064 --> 00:47:40.941
Huh. huh...

1129
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.819
Ugh...

1130
00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:44.821
Definitely not. Barbie. Uh-uh.

1131
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.280
Uh... also. you know.

1132
00:47:46.322 --> 00:47:48.865
I feel like I understand
Dad a lot better now.

1133
00:47:48.907 --> 00:47:50.576
I owe him an apology.

1134
00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:52.161
We'll have to climb down then.

1135
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.455
Good thing I packed
extra rope.

1136
00:47:56.666 --> 00:47:58.668
-Uh...

1137
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.169
[chuckles nervously]

1138
00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:04.423
[squirrel chittering]

1139
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:07.009
Oh...
[chuckles nervously]

1140
00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:10.555
everything overboard so fast?
Skipper. How did you throw

1141
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.097
I was motivated.

1142
00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:16.310
So... what now?

1143
00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:17.436
I don't know.

1144
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:19.104
-[puppy barking]
-Uh...

1145
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:20.981

[puppy barking]

1147
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:23.860

-There.

-Stacie! Hey Stacie!

1150
00:48:26.529 --> 00:48:27.697
Stacie! Stacie!

1151
00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:28.865
-Up. up. up. up!
-Stacie. here.

1152
00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.324
Look up!

1153
00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:31.743
Rookie! Stay!

1154
00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:33.077
[puppy barking]

1155
00:48:33.118 --> 00:48:35.496
[Barbie] Over here! Stacie!
Help us!

1156
00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:36.955
Do you hear that?

1157
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.250
[Barbie] Help us!
SOS save your sisters!

1158
00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:44.797
Skipper's balloon.
That's Barbie and

1159
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.382
They must be in trouble.

1160
00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:48.133
Is that what you saw. Rookie?

1161
00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.968
[puppy barking]

1162
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.221
Good job.

1163
00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:54.640
[puppy panting]

1164
00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:58.935
-Stacie!
-Help us!

1165
00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:01.814
Barbie! Skipper!
Are you okay?

1166
00:49:01.856 --> 00:49:04.483
Stacie. thank goodness
you're here.

1167
00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:07.695
[sighs]
Yeah. well. better than no one.

1168
00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:11.741
No! Stacie. stop.
I owe you an apology.

1169
00:49:11.783 --> 00:49:14.076
I got your hopes up about
the balloon race and...

1170
00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:16.579
I don't care about
the balloon race!

1171
00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:19.123
You don't?

1172
00:49:19.164 --> 00:49:22.167
I mean. I do but...
that was a mistake.

1173
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:23.502
It happens.

1174
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:26.380
I was disappointed
but I got over it.

1175
00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:28.090
But after that

1176
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:30.217
you wouldn't even show me
how to tie a knot.

1177
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:31.302
[sighs]

1178
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:33.596
And then you left me behind!

1179
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:36.390
Oh. Stacie. I'm so sorry.

1180
00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:38.975
I didn't want to talk about
ballooning stuff in front of you

1181
00:49:39.017 --> 00:49:41.228
because it seemed insensitive.

1182
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.107
I didn't realize I was making
you feel even more left out.

1183
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.487
There is no one I would rather
have as my co-pilot.

1184
00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:50.822
No one.

1185
00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:53.324
Uh... I'm right here.

1186
00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:56.494
supplies overboard.
You threw all our

1187
00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:58.120
Huh. Point taken.

1188
00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:00.456
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1189
00:50:00.498 --> 00:50:02.166
[tree branches crack]

1190
00:50:02.207 --> 00:50:04.585
But maybe we could save
the emotional apologies

1191
00:50:04.627 --> 00:50:06.545
until we're all
on the ground.

1192
00:50:06.587 --> 00:50:09.674
We can but I already
forgive you.

1193
00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:11.968
Thanks.

1194
00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:13.845
We're gonna fall.
we're gonna fall.

1195
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.346
We're gonna fall!

[branch cracking]

1197
00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:18.850
We have to get help. Now!

1198
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:20.935
The fairground isn't far.
If we take the go-karts

1199
00:50:20.977 --> 00:50:22.770
we can be there in
a few minutes.

1200
00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:26.315
Please don't let me fall!

1201
00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:27.650
You and Zeus go for help.

1202
00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:28.693
I'll stay here.

1203
00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:30.194
Okay. Come on. little guy.

Hmm.

Huh?

1207
00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:36.826
I've got a plan.

It's Ligaya.

A ride?

1217

Hang on a sec.
Catch your breath.

Hey honey.
Has the race started yet?

1222

We're almost there.

1223
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.109
George! Have you seen
Barbie and Skipper?

1224
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:14.279
They aren't here and I can't
reach them on their phones.

1225
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:15.865
What? No!

1226
00:51:15.907 --> 00:51:17.575
I thought they'd be there
by now.

1227

They're stuck in a tree!

Can you take us to them.

Yeah. follow me.

We're on our way.

Okay. We'll be right
behind you.

1235

Don't worry. we'll get
them down safe.

Alright. let's swing
into action here.

comes in.

have branches I can reach.

We are hanging on.
Literally.

Around. over itself.
through the loop and pull.

Everything comes down
to this.

1263

One rope. two sisters
and the throw of a lifetime.

A branch knocked
it over.

1287
00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:49.560
You'll have to find
another way down.

1288
00:53:50.352 --> 00:53:52.730
If you can get to the other
end of that branch.

00:54:11.832 --> 00:54:13.918
Like the monkey bars
back home.

1295
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.296
Uh... Barbie.

1296
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:21.092
I've never gotten to the end
of the monkey bars.
