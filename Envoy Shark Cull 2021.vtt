00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.400
[man 1]
Good evening. a great white
shark has been hunted. caught

4
00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.633
and killed after a horrifying
attack near Mandurah.

5
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.200
The shark was hooked
on drumlines off Falcon

6
00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:36.600
and towed out to sea.

7
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.067
but there's no confirmation

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.133
it was the shark that
attacked the surfer.

9
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:45.200
[Eric Bana]
Our whole lives. we've
been taught to fear them.

10
00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.233
Good evening.
two surfers have been injured.

11
00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.967
-A shark attack.
-Multiple attacks.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.600
-Bitten by a shark.
-Mauled by a shark.

13
00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:56.767
[Bana] Monsters. murderers.
man-eaters.

14
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.267
-Shark attack.
-Shark attacks.

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.067
-A shark attack.
-Two shark attacks.

[man 1] Terror
in the shallows.

17
00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.967
[Bana] But what if we've
been taught wrong?

18
00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.867
What if the very thing
you were taught to fear

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.833
had more to fear from us?

20
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:10.200
-Great white...
-[man] Shark attack...

21
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.233
-A great white...
-Shark attack.

22
00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:12.967
-[woman] Two shark attacks.
-Bitten by a shark.

23
00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.967
[Bana]
What if we knew we had a
greater chance of being killed

24
00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:18.367
by almost any other
animal on Earth

25
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.633
than by one of nature's oldest
and most evolved species?

26
00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.233
-Bitten by [inaudible].
-Shark attack.

27
00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:27.733
[indistinct conversations]

28
00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:31.933
[Bana]
What if our ignorance
is about to wipe them out?

29
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:35.900
Not in 100 years.
not in 50 years.

30
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:41.100
This generation. Right now.

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.233
They can't speak
for themselves.

32
00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:52.133
So we must be their envoy.

33
00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.067
[mellow theme music playing]

34
00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:23.833
[Layne Beachley]
I feel that one
of the greatest ways

35
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.600
that we can overcome
our fear of the unknown
is get to know it.

36
00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.067
One of the greatest ways

37
00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.333
I've been able to reduce
my fear of sharks.

38
00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.100
is swimming with them.

39
00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.867
Getting to understand
their gentle. curious nature.

40
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.200
it was one of the
most beautiful things

41
00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.300
I ever had to do

42
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.400
was just actually
sit underneath a bull shark

43
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.100
and watch it gracefully glide
around over the top of me.

44
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.333
it was just so beautiful.

45
00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:50.633
I never ever have experienced
a fear of a shark since then.

46
00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.067
[Juan Oliphant]
So pretty much.
you know. raised in Hawaii

47
00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:05.567
since I was two.

48
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.800
You know. I had seen them
as a lot as a kid. you know.
spearfishing.

49
00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.567
and I still was really. really
kind of a afraid of them.

50
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.733
But it wasn't until
I had a really bad accident
where I broke my back.

51
00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:18.700
And it left me paralyzed
for almost a good portion

52
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:22.700
of three or four months
and the remedy that really.

53
00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.900
that made the healing process
get better was the diving.

54
00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.067
And so now I was getting
engaged in diving.

55
00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:33.200
like almost every day trying
to get my back to normal.

56
00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:36.467
And the interactions
with sharks were a little
bit more consistent.

57
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.233
and they were far. far. far

58
00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.933
from what I was told
what I saw on TV. you know.

59
00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:43.767
and they were more scared
of me than I was of it

60
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.667
and that kind of like.
created this passion

61
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.300
and desire to want
to learn more.

62
00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.967
It's that fear of the unknown.
you know. for most people.

63
00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:53.667
and then you have other people
trying to fill in the gaps

64
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.233
with that lack of information.

65
00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.200
[waves splashing]

66
00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:06.400
So I think a lot of the
public fear all has to do
with fear of the unknown.

67
00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:10.067
It's that dark basement.
or what you can't see
in the water.

68
00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.600
and the more
we understand about sharks

69
00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.600
and their motivations
and the behaviors.

70
00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:17.133
the more that fear
just dissolves away.

71
00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.700
I've been with HSI
for almost two years now.

72
00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:22.533
I'm a marine biologist
and ocean campaigner.

73
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:26.367
There's been this massive
divide lately between science

74
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.967
and between
what's been accepted
or what's taken as fact.

75
00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.567
And I think just as important
as pushing forward

76
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.467
our knowledge and continuing
to do science and research.

77
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.233
it's important to bridge
that gap.

78
00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:50.800
There's something about.
you know. when you're
20 meters underwater.

79
00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.767
and you're sitting there
with the sharks.
they come past you

80
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.500
and their eye swivels around
and definitely looks at you.

81
00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.067
There's that awareness there.

82
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.733
And it's so calming
and quite lovely.

83
00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:11.833
Part of my mission and
a lot of scientists out there

84
00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:14.400
and conservationists.
and even people
who just love sharks

85
00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:15.533
and just love talking
about the them.

86
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.200
is to really sell
the truth of it.

87
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.800
We've got over 320 odd species
of sharks

88
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.267
and Rays in Australia.

89
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.267
You know.
half of them aren't found
anywhere else in the world.

90
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.933
And the go to species
that everyone thinks of

91
00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:30.967
are your tiger sharks.
great whites.

92
00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:33.733
are your whale sharks.
which are amazing.

93
00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.933
and incredibly beautiful
in their own right.

94
00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:40.267
But there's also these other
species that were just...

95
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.233
the majority people
I don't think are aware of.

96
00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:50.133
I grew up in the ocean.
and I got to see sharks

97
00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:51.633
for what they naturally were.

98
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.300
which is absolutely
beautiful and fascinating.

99
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.333
And as I grew up. I realized
how important they were.

100
00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:59.300
I went to school
for marine biology.

101
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.067
And as I traveled
around the world

102
00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:03.067
and worked around the world.
I realized that people

103
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.700
had a very heavy damaging
misconception of them.

104
00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.133
and that they're actually
the real victims

105
00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.300
and the ones that have
something to fear.

106
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.700
I think for a very long time.

107
00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:19.067
people didn't know
very much about sharks.

108
00:06:19.067 --> 00:06:21.833
So it's very easy
to be afraid of them.

109
00:06:21.867 --> 00:06:24.500
you're afraid naturally of
something that you don't know.

110
00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:34.867
[Holly Richmond]
When you see sharks
under the water.

111
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.067
they're just so majestic

112
00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:39.267
and actually
a lot more scared of us

113
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.867
than what you know what we
typically are of them as well.

114
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.333
So getting to know sharks
under the water

115
00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:47.067
is probably the best way
to meet sharks

116
00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:48.167
and understand them.

117
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.333
There was this moment
when I was about 15 years old.

118
00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.433
and I was diving with
two really big tiger sharks.

119
00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:03.967
And it was just amazing.
it was late in the afternoon.
the light was beautiful.

120
00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:05.700
and then suddenly
they disappeared.

121
00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:07.067
So there's
this is anticipation.

122
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.600
and all of a sudden out
of the corner of this

123
00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:10.200
great hammerhead
swims through.

124
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:12.333
the middle
of the water column.

125
00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:14.433
and its head was
as wide as I was tall.

126
00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.900
And at first I thought it was
a whale. it was that big.

127
00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:19.200
And this creature.
this massive creature

128
00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:23.333
that I had been
kind of taught by society my
entire life to be scared of.

129
00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:25.833
just passed through and didn't
even pay attention to me

130
00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:27.133
and it was one
of the greatest things

131
00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:29.200
I had ever seen
in my entire life.

132
00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.300
[waves splashing]

133
00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:42.533
I grew up on the Gold Coast
I've been here my entire life.

134
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.133
It's been home.

135
00:07:44.167 --> 00:07:45.967
And I feel like
when I was a kid.

136
00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.800
I was the only person
looking out to sea.

137
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.233
seeing the shark nets
and drum lines

138
00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:52.967
and thinking what on earth
is going on here?

139
00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:55.067
[Jonathan Clark]
When I got involved
in the chapter in Brisbane.

140
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.767
I didn't have
a lot of knowledge
about nets and drum lines.

141
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.967
I was probably typical
of a lot of the population.

142
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:07.700
[Tom Carroll]
I learned to surf
on this beach. in that water

143
00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:11.200
starting around
seven years of age.

144
00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:14.267
To be honest I've never even
thought about the shark nets.

145
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.333
I used to use the buoys
to paddle around

146
00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:21.467
when we were doing
a lot of open ocean paddling.

147
00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:27.967
[Holly]
I've been assisting
Humpback Whale Research

148
00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:31.667
for the past four years.
and particularly on the
east coast of Australia.

149
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.533
humpback whales
are becoming entangled
in shark nets.

150
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.800
And that sparked
my interest with shark nets

151
00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:39.267
and exactly what are they
and what are the aims

152
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.800
and the methods
of this program?

153
00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:44.067
So I basically took the
initiative to go out there

154
00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:46.100
and get a view
for myself of exactly

155
00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:48.067
what's happening
beneath the surface.

156
00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:53.133
The biggest misconception
that people have

157
00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:54.733
towards the
Shark Control Program

158
00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.067
is that a lot of people think

159
00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:58.567
that it's a physical barrier
between them

160
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.100
and the open ocean.

161
00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:05.733
People aren't aware that this
device is a fishing device.

162
00:09:05.767 --> 00:09:08.333
it's there to capture
and to kill passing sharks

163
00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:10.833
and I think a lot of people
are surprised

164
00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:13.800
when they realize that
it's not a physical barrier

165
00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.633
that is completely enclosed

166
00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:18.100
or it doesn't touch
the bottom of the ocean.

167
00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:24.067
[Bana]
Bright buoys visible
from the shore in the air.

168
00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:26.600
draw a line through
the ocean.

169
00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.567
between the comfort
of the shallows
and the mystery of the deep.

170
00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:35.967
Not many people know
exactly what they are.

171
00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:40.467
or how they work. just told
that it keeps them safe.

172
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.967
Even fewer people
know the truth.

173
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:03.267
[man 2]
Australian beaches renowned
for their long unbroken

174
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.333
surf line and
clean white gold sand

175
00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:07.033
are among the
most beautiful in the world.

176
00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:10.333
This lovely beach
is a typical example.

177
00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:12.700
[Bana]
Shark nets were first
introduced off the east coast

178
00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:15.500
of Australia in 1937.

179
00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:19.500
with drumlines
following soon after.

180
00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:22.167
It's the very same decade
Qantas first started flying

181
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.600
between Australia and London.

182
00:10:24.633 --> 00:10:27.600
Flights could fit
just ten passengers.

183
00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:32.733
had 21 stopovers.
and took a total of 12 days.

184
00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.133
Our world has evolved beyond
recognition since then.

185
00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:41.033
but shark nets
and drumlines have stayed
fundamentally the same.

186
00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:47.467
Shark nets in Queensland are
186 meters wide by six meters.

187
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.133
hang from the surface. and
sit in water 12 meters deep.

188
00:10:55.933 --> 00:11:00.833
Shark nets in New South Wales
are 150 meters by six meters

189
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:04.700
are anchored to the sea floor.
also in water 12 meters deep.

190
00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:08.933
Both programs
cover only a tiny portion

191
00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:10.367
of any given beach.

192
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.300
allowing sharks ample
opportunity to swim over.

193
00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:17.467
under. around.
and towards beaches.

194
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.267
In fact.
a high percentage of sharks

195
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.433
are caught inside the nets.

196
00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:24.533
They've already been
to the beach.

197
00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:28.067
and are peacefully making
their way back out to sea.

198
00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:33.300
Drumlines use a
large buoy on the surface

199
00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:36.633
to suspend a baited industrial
fishing hook

200
00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:40.067
dangling below
on heavy duty chains.

201
00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:42.800
They chum the waters.
attracting sharks.

202
00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:44.867
in the hopes of hooking them.

203
00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:48.367
If anyone in a snorkel
and fins can navigate

204
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.167
around this technology.

205
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.567
why would we think
that sharks can't?

206
00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:56.600
People think that
shark incidents are happening

207
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.100
at a higher rate
than what they really are.

208
00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:03.167
Being bitten by a shark
is extremely unlikely.

209
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.267
Unfortunately. when there
is a shark bite incident.

210
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.067
the media jump onto this

211
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.233
and they report it
over and over again.

212
00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:13.600
There's a rogue shark
out there.

213
00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.100
the Jaws mentality. right?

214
00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.633
That it's got to taste
for human blood.

215
00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:18.300
and it's not gonna
stop until you know.

216
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:21.300
so it's just like
that kind of mentality.

217
00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:24.200
it's so false.
and it's like a lie basically.

218
00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:26.367
you know.
when it comes down to it.

219
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.133
[woman 1]
When I've seen or heard
on the news that there was

220
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:32.333
a shark attack.
my heart fully sinks

221
00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:35.400
and it's a really terrible
feeling because

222
00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:38.667
one. you know.
that someone's just been
through something traumatic

223
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.500
and the media
has taken advantage of that.

224
00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:43.467
And two. you know that that
means bad news for sharks.

225
00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.667
[woman 2]
Trauma and
sensationalism sells.

226
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.100
And so for generations now.
the media has capitalized off

227
00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:51.833
of demonizing them.

228
00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:55.367
[Dr. Leonardo Guida]
Drone footage
is now coming out.

229
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.767
particularly
from New South Wales.

230
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.100
and the photography
is awesome.

231
00:12:58.133 --> 00:13:00.500
I mean. the colors.
shapes. and you see surfers

232
00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.367
and you see the silhouette
of a shark in the water

233
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.067
and the headline
is "Shark stalks surfer".

234
00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:08.267
And it's like. no. the sharks
just doing its thing.

235
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.467
It probably
hasn't even seen the surfer.

236
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.233
[Jonathan]
The number of times
that negative language

237
00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:17.267
about sharks is repeated
for every shark bite incident.

238
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.233
The number of reports
is astounding.

239
00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:23.067
The average is in the 30s.

240
00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.733
[Lawrence Chlebeck]
But the media
will report on them

241
00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:27.067
because these incidents
can be tragic.

242
00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:28.500
They can be traumatic.

243
00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:31.700
We hear words like
maul. man eater. attack.

244
00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:33.100
but more accurately.

245
00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:35.967
these interactions
are classified as just that.
interactions.

246
00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:38.567
It's a bump
or an investigative bite.

247
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.767
We all understand that those
bites can be very tragic

248
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.933
and traumatic.
but it's very. very rarely.

249
00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:46.833
and almost never.
an actual attack.

250
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:49.600
And that feeds into the public
psyche. of what they think.

251
00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:51.967
They think the sharks
are out there hunting them.

252
00:13:52.067 --> 00:13:55.067
And that's really not at all
what's happening.

253
00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.400
[Ocean Ramsey]
The tolerance
that sharks show for humans

254
00:13:58.433 --> 00:14:01.367
being such capable
predators as they are.

255
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.400
it never ceases to astonish me

256
00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:06.167
and people don't give them
credit for that.

257
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.067
They swim past surfers.
swimmers. and divers

258
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.067
all day. every day.

259
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.167
And it's so rare
that they make a mistake.

260
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.600
You think about how many
mistakes humans make.

261
00:14:13.633 --> 00:14:16.133
And it's just... I wish
that they got that credit.

262
00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:17.700
and that made the news.

263
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:19.500
because that's something
that happens every day.

264
00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:22.800
and not the extremely rare
mistaken identity bite.

265
00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:34.200
I used to be
terrified of sharks.

266
00:14:34.233 --> 00:14:37.067
Uh. I didn't really know
anything about them

267
00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:38.500
except for what
the media told me

268
00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:40.933
and that was always
gnashing teeth

269
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:42.467
and blood and fear.

270
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.300
And so I fed into that.

271
00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:48.067
In 2005. I ended up passing
a selection course

272
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.400
for the Navy clearance divers

273
00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:51.500
and started
a whole new career.

274
00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:54.500
and I didn't just find
my dream job.

275
00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:56.200
I found my dream life.

276
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.567
In 2009.

277
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.933
I had been a clearance diver
for about four years.

278
00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:07.800
and every single time.
honestly. I got in the water.

279
00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:09.367
I had sharks on the brain.

280
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.833
Even though sharks
terrified me.

281
00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:13.567
I had a focus to get that
out of my mind.

282
00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:16.867
I was swimming in the water
on the surface

283
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.867
right in Sydney Harbor.
right alongside the Navy base.

284
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.233
And I was on my back.
on the surface.

285
00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:26.567
kicking my legs.
doing what we call finning.

286
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.733
I was facing
the other direction.

287
00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:30.867
making sure I was headed
towards the warship

288
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.067
where I was supposed
to be going

289
00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:34.667
and I felt this massive
whack in my leg.

290
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.600
And I turned back around
and came face to face

291
00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:42.333
with a massive shark's head
and I didn't know what to do.

292
00:15:42.367 --> 00:15:45.833
I'd never even seen a big.
dangerous shark before.

293
00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.467
And then all of a sudden.
it's attached to me.

294
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.300
My survival instincts
kicked in.

295
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.900
I thought I've got
to get this thing off me.

296
00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:54.233
But I couldn't move my arm

297
00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:56.067
because my hand
was in its mouth.

298
00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:57.733
And so I grabbed it
by the nose

299
00:15:57.767 --> 00:15:59.800
and I tried to lever it
off my leg

300
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.300
but all that did was push
the teeth of the lower jaw

301
00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.600
deeper into my leg.

302
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.500
So in a last ditch effort.

303
00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.567
I cocked back
to punch it in the nose.

304
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.767
and it started to shake me

305
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.067
and I can't even tell you
how painful this was.

306
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.500
It took me underwater.

307
00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:19.433
and I wasn't just in pain.
I was terrified.

308
00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:23.200
This was my worst nightmare.
And I thought I was gonna die.

309
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.133
The shark's tail
splashed water into my face

310
00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.267
and kind of shook me
back to reality.

311
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.067
And I realized.
"Oh. I'm not dead."

312
00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:36.500
And I thought I've gotta
get back to the safety boat.

313
00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:38.067
So my laser-like focus.

314
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.500
all that navy training
and army training kicked in.

315
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:44.967
My sole entire mission
was to get back to that boat.

316
00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.467
As soon as the guys
pulled me into the boat.

317
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.633
I just relaxed.

318
00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:50.933
Just for the simple fact
that I was safe.

319
00:16:50.967 --> 00:16:54.200
my eyes rolled back
in my head and I passed out.

320
00:16:54.233 --> 00:16:57.533
and my mate Tommo
sprang into action.

321
00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.633
And his medical training
told him

322
00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.733
that I was going
into cardiac arrest.

323
00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:04.800
And so he straddled me
and started pummeling me
in the chest

324
00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:07.267
trying to stimulate my heart
to wake me back up.

325
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.833
and it worked.

326
00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:11.367
And I woke up.
and I looked over.

327
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.800
and my hand was gone.

328
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.833
And I looked up.

329
00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:19.133
and Tommo was beating
the crap out of me.

330
00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:21.233
And I just thought.
"Today sucks."

331
00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:27.067
After the shark attack.

332
00:17:27.067 --> 00:17:28.267
the media was coming to me

333
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.133
to talk about shark
interactions all around
Australia.

334
00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:32.600
And so I had to learn.

335
00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:34.267
so that I knew
what I was talking about.

336
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.467
I can give an educated opinion
instead of just an opinion.

337
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.167
And through doing
that research

338
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.933
and building that knowledge
on sharks.

339
00:17:41.967 --> 00:17:44.167
I started to learn
about the plight of sharks.

340
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.333
about how much strife
they're in.

341
00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:49.067
about what we do to them.

342
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.133
And the old adage goes.
knowledge dispels fear.

343
00:17:52.167 --> 00:17:53.733
and that was so true for me.

344
00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:12.300
[Jonathan]
The title of the program
in New South Wales

345
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:15.067
is the
Bather Protection Program.

346
00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:16.200
There is the
underlying message.

347
00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:17.367
"We're the government.

348
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.667
and we are keeping you safe
from this big. scary thing."

349
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.133
In Queensland.

350
00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:24.900
we call it
the Shark Control Program.

351
00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:27.300
I defy anyone
to control a shark.

352
00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:28.633
How do you control

353
00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:30.567
one of the greatest animals
in the ocean?

354
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.133
How do you do that?

355
00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:36.900
[Dr. Leonardo]
So the Shark Control Program
in Queensland.

356
00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:38.500
and I hate using
the word "Control".

357
00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:40.233
because you cannot control
an animal.

358
00:18:40.267 --> 00:18:43.067
But for the lack
of a better phrase.

359
00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:45.567
the Shark Control Program
in Queensland as it stands.

360
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.400
its intention is
to kill sharks. to cull them.

361
00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:53.867
My first time swimming
with a tiger shark

362
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.367
was on a drumline
on the Gold Coast.

363
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.333
and she was

364
00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:03.467
literally taking her
last breaths in front of us.

365
00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:09.733
She been hanging there
for quite some time.

366
00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:12.067
Uh. probably early hours
in the morning

367
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.267
and she was suffocating
on this drumline

368
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.567
and I was able to get
really close to her

369
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.500
and I couldn't...

370
00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:24.133
Looking at the details
of this animal was insane.

371
00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:26.767
the patterns on their skin.

372
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.633
And people always refer
to shark's eyes

373
00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:33.167
to be lifeless and soulless
and dark and black.

374
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.633
But looking at her eyes.
they were light colored brown

375
00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:40.500
and they were
so beautiful and deep.

376
00:19:40.533 --> 00:19:42.767
You could be looking
into the eyes of a turtle

377
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.600
or your own dog at home.

378
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.733
That moment really made me

379
00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:50.600
feel connected
to these animals

380
00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:53.267
and made me realize that...

381
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.067
they're just crying for help.

382
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.633
and we're just endlessly
killing them out there.

383
00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:02.200
I've seen multiple tiger
sharks hooked on drumlines.

384
00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:05.100
In fact. the first one
that I ever saw in Australia

385
00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:06.733
was hooked on a drumline.

386
00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:09.633
and it was very difficult
for me to film

387
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.533
because I got in the water
with it thinking it was dead.

388
00:20:12.567 --> 00:20:14.000
but then its eye
was still moving.

389
00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:16.300
so it was just this animal
that I'd always associated

390
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.833
with such power
and presence in the ocean.

391
00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:21.167
And it was just like
laying there. dead.

392
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.667
It was like
going into your yard

393
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.000
and seeing your own pet dog
hooked up on a drumline.

394
00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:29.033
Most people talk about
getting in the water
with sharks for the first time

395
00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:32.100
and their hands are sweaty
and their heart's racing
and they're freaking out.

396
00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:34.333
That's exactly how I felt
when I got out of the water

397
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.800
after filming a dead one.

398
00:20:35.833 --> 00:20:37.833
My heart was racing.
my hands were sweating.

399
00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:39.300
It was terrifying.

400
00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.400
It was the only time I've been
in the water with a shark

401
00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:44.567
that I was truly unable
to control my reaction.

402
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.000
Seeing that animal dead
on a drumline was really sad

403
00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:50.433
and really horrific.

404
00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:53.167
And the saddest thing
about all of it

405
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.533
is living in a country

406
00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:57.333
where people kind of
rooted that on

407
00:20:57.367 --> 00:20:58.667
and wanted that to happen.

408
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.533
and in their eyes.
that was a good thing.

409
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.800
[Bana]
For 83 years and counting.

410
00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:11.633
we've been running the world's
longest marine cull.

411
00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:15.633
These culling programs
off Australian shores

412
00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:19.733
add to the millions of sharks
killed globally each year.

413
00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:22.933
However.
unlike the fishing industry.

414
00:23:22.967 --> 00:23:25.567
these culling programs
specifically aim

415
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.200
to kill some endangered
and protected species.

416
00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:30.900
Like the Great White.

417
00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:33.933
Unlike regular fishing.

418
00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:36.400
there are no size limits
in these culls.

419
00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:39.600
Making juveniles. who haven't
reached breeding age yet.

420
00:23:39.633 --> 00:23:41.533
fair game.

421
00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:44.667
decimating an already
threatened population

422
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.367
in the name of safety.

423
00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:58.633
[Paul] I understand
that parents and surfers

424
00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:01.567
and everyone that frequents
the beach in Australia

425
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.367
wants to remain safe.

426
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.600
I don't want anyone
to get attacked either.
Trust me. it hurts.

427
00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:07.800
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

428
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:09.367
I don't want anyone dying.

429
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.767
The problem that I have

430
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.067
with the culling of sharks
around Australia is that...

431
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.800
it's not a solution
by any means.

432
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.467
It's a false sense
of security at best.

433
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.867
which is only lulling people
more into the ocean

434
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.433
to risk their lives.

435
00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:29.833
The nets that they have
around Australia.

436
00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:32.700
especially Queensland
and New South Wales.

437
00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:34.800
they don't go to the bottom
of the ocean.

438
00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:36.567
they don't go
to the top of the water.

439
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.433
they don't span
the whole beach.

440
00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:41.733
The sharks can swim around it.
over it. and under it.

441
00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:43.833
and there's nothing
stopping them

442
00:24:43.867 --> 00:24:45.500
from getting to the beach.

443
00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:47.133
Now I understand
they've put them in there

444
00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:49.833
to maybe take out
a few of the sharks

445
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:50.967
that are hanging around.

446
00:24:51.067 --> 00:24:56.367
but sharks don't domesticate
one area. they migrate.

447
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.500
These sharks that are swimming
through Australian waters.

448
00:24:59.533 --> 00:25:02.467
especially the Great Whites
that we're killing.

449
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.867
they don't belong
to Australia.

450
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.567
They'll swim...
They've been known to swim
all the way to Hawaii.

451
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.633
They swim all the way
down the coast.

452
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:12.300
all the way down
to New Zealand.

453
00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.067
They interbreed down there.

454
00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:16.267
They swim back up the coast.
they follow the whales.

455
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.500
they follow the fish.

456
00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:19.333
They're the ocean sharks.
They're the world's sharks.

457
00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:22.067
They're not Australia's
property to kill.

458
00:25:22.067 --> 00:25:23.267
And this is what happens

459
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.233
when you have
government ministers

460
00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:26.800
running departments

461
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:29.067
that they have
no education in.

462
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.367
no background in.

463
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.267
and don't know
what they're doing.

464
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.967
They just pander to the
loudest common denominator.

465
00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:37.200
And that's usually the people

466
00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:39.967
calling for the death
of animals. especially sharks.

467
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:46.500
So anecdotally. what you hear
from a lot of people

468
00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:48.567
that are out on the water
a lot. from fishermen.
and such.

469
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.467
is that sharks
are in plague proportions.

470
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.167
And what we need to remember
that these are very
intelligent animals

471
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.967
that have an ecological
feeding plasticity

472
00:25:56.067 --> 00:25:59.067
that can change their behavior
and follow this salmon
run here

473
00:25:59.067 --> 00:26:00.767
or go over here
when they need to.

474
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800
They've been around
for 350 million years

475
00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:05.400
perfecting the ability
to change their behavior

476
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:09.167
for high success
feeding opportunities.

477
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.100
And now fishermen
and fishing boats

478
00:26:11.133 --> 00:26:13.767
provide that high success
feeding opportunity.

479
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.267
So the fact that there's
a massive decline of sharks

480
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.400
and that fishermen
are seeing many of them
around their boats

481
00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:21.533
are not mutually exclusive.

482
00:26:21.567 --> 00:26:23.967
Fishermen can see many.
many sharks around their boats

483
00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:26.533
because they know
that this is where
they can get an easy feed.

484
00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:29.567
However. shark scientists
everywhere around the world.

485
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.133
including the east coast
of Australia.

486
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:33.533
will tell you
that sharks are dwindling.

487
00:26:33.567 --> 00:26:35.700
Sharks are in major decline
and have been

488
00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:37.400
for about the last
50 to 60 years.

489
00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:44.633
[Jonathan]
We know that the general
population of sharks

490
00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:46.767
has been in great decline.

491
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.333
and there is science
absolutely backing that.

492
00:26:49.367 --> 00:26:52.067
We know that tiger sharks
on the Queensland coast

493
00:26:52.067 --> 00:26:53.700
since 1962.

494
00:26:53.733 --> 00:26:56.367
the science is saying
around about 73% decline.

495
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.067
which is absolutely massive.

496
00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:14.567
Hearing numbers
like 70 to 100 million sharks
are killed every year.

497
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.833
And the big one that got me
was that in 30 years.

498
00:27:17.867 --> 00:27:20.400
we've killed 90-95%

499
00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:22.300
of the world's shark
population.

500
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.233
In 30 years. like...

501
00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:25.833
What's gonna happen
in another 30 years?

502
00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:26.833
They're gone. right?

503
00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:28.300
You know. when you hear
those kind of numbers.

504
00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:30.500
you're like. "Whoa. what?
You know. rewind."

505
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.533
[Bana]
Programs like this
are a global anomaly.

506
00:27:36.567 --> 00:27:38.333
Only two other countries
on earth

507
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:42.767
operate culling programs.
South Africa and France.

508
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.233
That's it.

509
00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:47.267
Everywhere else in the world.
it's understood.

510
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.867
Their home. your risk.

511
00:27:53.433 --> 00:27:54.800
There's another chain
of islands

512
00:27:54.833 --> 00:27:57.733
all alone in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean

513
00:27:57.767 --> 00:28:00.767
that is confronted by these
very same challenges.

514
00:28:02.067 --> 00:28:03.500
A paradise where sharks

515
00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:06.667
carry a strong
cultural significance.

516
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.767
held sacred by many families

517
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.067
as their ancestral
spirit guides.

518
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.333
Traditionally respected
but not feared.

519
00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:18.167
Hawaii.

520
00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:24.567
It's so sad and unfortunate

521
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.533
that even in Hawaii. um.
multiple decades ago.

522
00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:29.100
they actually culled sharks.

523
00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:31.900
some of the methods
being nets or drumlines.

524
00:28:31.933 --> 00:28:34.167
And it was scientifically
documented in study

525
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.967
to show that it does nothing
to reduce the number

526
00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:38.700
of adverse interactions.

527
00:28:38.733 --> 00:28:42.267
And so we've scientifically
proven that culling
is not effective

528
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.667
and can actually attract
sharks closer to shore.

529
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:51.200
[Juan] Back in '91.
there was a series
of mistaken identity bites.

530
00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:52.500
so about seven.

531
00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:54.167
And no fatalities.

532
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.600
but it was within.
like. a three-month span.

533
00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:59.767
So the community.
especially here
on the North Shore of Oahu.

534
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.300
was really concerned.

535
00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:04.567
and it kind of sparked a cull.
you know. and...

536
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.667
I was just a kid at the time.
but it was a scary time.

537
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.267
It was just the fear
throughout the community.

538
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.900
and it's probably similar
to in certain parts

539
00:29:10.933 --> 00:29:12.767
what's going on
in Australia right now.

540
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.600
but it was really sad.

541
00:29:14.633 --> 00:29:15.833
I mean. they killed...

542
00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:18.600
I think that estimated
at the time
that they were done

543
00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:21.400
in that year period.
they killed
over 500 tiger sharks.

544
00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:23.433
So it was really bad.

545
00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:26.933
The really nice thing
about that period though.

546
00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:30.733
a scientist named Carl Meyers
was doing a study on it.

547
00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:34.667
And he proved that culling
was actually not effective.

548
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.100
And in fact. when you take out
a large apex predator

549
00:29:38.133 --> 00:29:39.367
like a tiger shark.

550
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.200
which is a very
territorial animal
and nomadic species.

551
00:29:42.233 --> 00:29:44.500
you're actually
reducing that area

552
00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:47.733
to allow more smaller
juvenile sharks.

553
00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:50.600
And the larger sharks
are actually a lot more
knowledgeable

554
00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:52.800
about what's a food source.
what's not a food source.

555
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.967
So in essence.
you're bringing
these teenagers in

556
00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:57.133
that are still trying
to figure out what's going on.

557
00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:59.067
And those are the ones
making the mistakes.

558
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.967
not these big. large.
beautiful females
or adult tiger sharks.

559
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.767
and so it was making
the situation worse

560
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.333
by killing the large sharks.

561
00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:09.533
So growing up with that fear.

562
00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:12.400
it's so interesting to see
where I'm at today.

563
00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:14.700
you know. and my whole life
kind of feels like

564
00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:16.633
it's been about protecting
an animal that I grew up

565
00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:18.467
so petrified of.

566
00:30:19.867 --> 00:30:21.467
[Ocean]
And so we've used
that research

567
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.867
to try and push.
and more so the community
and conservation efforts.

568
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.667
to push. to ban the purposeful
killing of sharks and rays.

569
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.733
And. um.
in the last few years.

570
00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.400
this push for protection
for sharks

571
00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:36.933
has been met
by some opposition

572
00:30:36.967 --> 00:30:38.567
at different levels.

573
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.633
The first level
was financially.

574
00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:42.567
Could they actually
enforce the law?

575
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.233
We address that
through support.

576
00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:45.967
through ecotourism.

577
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.633
And so actually taking
a very small percentage
of money

578
00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:51.967
from people who want
to go see a live shark

579
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.133
and that could easily
fund that bill.

580
00:30:54.167 --> 00:30:55.567
So it's really...

581
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.433
It's tough working
in the political systems.

582
00:30:58.467 --> 00:31:00.667
but it is possible.
and every year.

583
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.900
the number of people
in support of these bills
is growing.

584
00:31:11.467 --> 00:31:16.867
[Bana] Until now.
these programs have operated
under a veil of secrecy.

585
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.133
They have successfully
avoided intense scrutiny
from the public eye.

586
00:31:21.167 --> 00:31:23.233
Some politicians are adamant

587
00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:25.933
that these programs
keep swimmers safe.

588
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:30.133
citing the low number
of fatalities at beaches
where culling occurs.

589
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.500
But has it really
saved human lives

590
00:31:33.533 --> 00:31:36.533
by killing hundreds
of thousands of sharks?

591
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.200
The Great Barrier Reef.
An Australian icon.

592
00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:52.367
So remarkable
you can see it from space.

593
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.767
The jewel in our marine crown.

594
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.767
It is the world's largest
coral reef ecosystem.

595
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.933
home to thousands
of unique species.

596
00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:04.600
It's one of the best known
natural wonders of the world.

597
00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:06.133
already under threat

598
00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:08.967
from warming
and acidifying oceans.

599
00:32:09.067 --> 00:32:12.067
It's important to know
how critical sharks are

600
00:32:12.067 --> 00:32:15.200
to keeping this fragile
ecosystem alive

601
00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:18.700
and just how dangerous
it could be to remove them.

602
00:32:26.267 --> 00:32:28.567
[Dr. Leonardo]
Austrians love
the Great Barrier Reef.

603
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.067
I mean. intuitively.
instinctively.

604
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.233
You know you can feel it.
I'm thinking it right now.

605
00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:33.733
I just say Great Barrier Reef
and I'm like.

606
00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:35.900
"Yes. Australia."

607
00:32:35.933 --> 00:32:40.400
But how to articulate
that into words...

608
00:32:40.433 --> 00:32:41.667
I think that's actually
the beauty of it.

609
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.400
The fact that you can't
really articulate it.

610
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:45.467
It's magical and mystical.

611
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.567
I think that's why people
love the Great Barrier Reef.

612
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.233
and when you do get
a chance to see it.

613
00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:51.067
I mean. aside from pictures
and videos...

614
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.100
When you do get
a chance to see it.

615
00:32:53.133 --> 00:32:55.400
it's mind blowing.

616
00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:16.067
The Great Barrier Reef
Outlook Report 2019

617
00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:18.967
is a report that's done
every five years.

618
00:33:19.067 --> 00:33:21.833
And it assesses the health
of the Great Barrier Reef.

619
00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:24.533
uh. the pressures.
the challenges it faces.

620
00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:26.067
the gaps in our knowledge.

621
00:33:26.067 --> 00:33:29.467
and also it gives
a bit of a projection
of its likely future.

622
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.867
Unfortunately.

623
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.267
the latest report
has downgraded
the Great Barrier Reef

624
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.167
from being in poor health
to very poor health.

625
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.700
It identified as a key threat

626
00:33:41.733 --> 00:33:43.933
to the resilience
and health of the reef

627
00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:47.067
uh. the removal of predators.
top-level predators.

628
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.667
and that includes your sharks.

629
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.300
and there's an issue
with some species

630
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.833
uh. that are under
considerable threat.

631
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:57.500
[Holly]
Sharks play a vital role
in an ecosystem.

632
00:33:57.533 --> 00:34:01.333
And by taking out sharks
off the Great Barrier Reef.

633
00:34:01.367 --> 00:34:03.433
we're gonna see
dramatic effects

634
00:34:03.467 --> 00:34:04.733
so we're gonna see impacts

635
00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:07.267
on even the lowest
of levels with corals

636
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.933
and the amount of algae
that grows on the corals.

637
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.800
[Dr. Leonardo]
If we take out the sharks.

638
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:15.667
your middle fish
explode in numbers.

639
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.867
and these middle fish
are sometimes herbivores.

640
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.800
so they might eat
the algae off coral.

641
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:24.167
munch on the coral
or animals around the coral.

642
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.667
And if their numbers
essentially grow unchecked.

643
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.567
then all of a sudden.
the coral is experiencing

644
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600
a lot of pressure
it otherwise wasn't under.

645
00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:33.533
Then. the herbivores
have got nothing left to eat.

646
00:34:33.567 --> 00:34:35.867
and then
they kind of fall apart.

647
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.500
The sharks actually perform

648
00:34:40.533 --> 00:34:42.633
more than just
a predatory role.

649
00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:44.533
Uh. it's quite complex
how they work

650
00:34:44.567 --> 00:34:45.967
for an ecosystem.

651
00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:47.633
Um. Sharks also modify

652
00:34:47.667 --> 00:34:50.300
the behavior of other animals
in the system.

653
00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:52.833
So a great example.

654
00:34:52.867 --> 00:34:54.700
looking at tiger sharks
and dugongs.

655
00:34:54.733 --> 00:34:57.533
what the tiger shark does
is it comes into an area.

656
00:34:57.567 --> 00:35:00.067
The dugong is happily
munching away on seagrass

657
00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:02.500
around a reef ecosystem.
a coastal ecosystem.

658
00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.667
a seagrass meadow or wherever.

659
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.900
It's happily munching away.

660
00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:07.167
getting its fill.
not a care in the world.

661
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.933
The moment
it senses or notices

662
00:35:08.967 --> 00:35:10.200
a tiger shark in the area.

663
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:11.867
all of a sudden
it's on its toes.

664
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.867
Um. it stops eating.

665
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.133
and it might dart off
somewhere else

666
00:35:15.167 --> 00:35:16.233
and eat a little bit there.

667
00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:19.067
'cause it's now more concerned
about being eaten itself

668
00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:20.667
than eating seagrass.

669
00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:27.233
So seagrass actually stores
more carbon than rainforests.

670
00:35:27.267 --> 00:35:28.700
What the tiger shark is doing

671
00:35:28.733 --> 00:35:31.500
by modifying or changing
the behavior of the dugong.

672
00:35:31.533 --> 00:35:33.367
one. it's looking
after the little guys.

673
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.533
so these fish can grow up

674
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:35.900
and venture out
into the ocean.

675
00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:38.067
and two. it's helping us
fight climate change.

676
00:35:38.067 --> 00:35:39.800
So the tiger shark
protecting the seagrass.

677
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.100
it's ensuring that we have
a good carbon store.

678
00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:47.833
[Holly]
We can't just take
one species

679
00:35:47.867 --> 00:35:51.867
or one type of animal
out of an ecosystem

680
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.167
and expect the rest
to function normally.

681
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.267
It all interlinks
with each other

682
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.333
and taking the sharks out.

683
00:35:58.367 --> 00:36:01.300
you're actually gonna have
a really big impact

684
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:04.867
on the coral reef
and that impacts
our tourism in Australia.

685
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.067
We have a lot of people

686
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.900
that wanna see
the Great Barrier Reef.

687
00:36:07.933 --> 00:36:10.900
but by taking sharks out
of that ecosystem.

688
00:36:10.933 --> 00:36:12.533
it's not gonna be the same.

689
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.667
[Dr. Leonardo]
We've had some studies
come out that show

690
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.733
that having sharks on the reef

691
00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:21.300
boosts not only the kinds
of fish you find there

692
00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:23.100
but just the absolute
numbers of fish

693
00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:24.233
by having sharks there.

694
00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:27.067
And it's one of the reasons
why reef areas

695
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.367
are particularly
popular with fishers.

696
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.500
both commercial
and recreational.

697
00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.933
'cause there are
a lot of fish.

698
00:36:31.967 --> 00:36:33.400
and the sizes of fish
are reasonably decent.

699
00:36:33.433 --> 00:36:35.900
And to have that support
on a reef ecosystem.

700
00:36:35.933 --> 00:36:37.367
you need sharks.

701
00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:48.200
[Madison Stewart]
So when I was
about 12 years old.

702
00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:50.733
I did my first ever trip
to the Great Barrier Reef.

703
00:36:50.767 --> 00:36:53.467
And there was this one spot
where my dad and I

704
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.067
would get in the water
for a night dive.

705
00:36:55.067 --> 00:36:56.633
And we'd wait
for the divers to leave

706
00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:58.800
and we'd stay under the boats
'cause the boats
had these big floodlights

707
00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.467
that would bring
all the little fish around

708
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.067
and then all the sharks
would come around
to eat these little fish.

709
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.600
So there was
about 20 to 30 little
Grey Reef Sharks

710
00:37:05.633 --> 00:37:06.967
behind the back of the boat.

711
00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:08.667
And I used to do this thing
where I would breathe

712
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.233
really heavy
in my SCUBA equipment

713
00:37:10.267 --> 00:37:11.700
and accelerate my heart rate.

714
00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:13.333
And the sharks
would pick up on that.

715
00:37:13.367 --> 00:37:16.533
and they would come in
and start. like. buzzing me
and getting all excited.

716
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.433
And that was like
this little game
I played with them.

717
00:37:18.467 --> 00:37:21.667
It was the first time
that I really had an amazing
connection with sharks.

718
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.700
But the very next year.
I came back to that same spot.

719
00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:28.300
the same reef. the same dive.
same time of year.

720
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:29.833
and there were
no sharks there.

721
00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:31.800
There was like one shark
in the distance

722
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.700
too scared to come close
to the light.

723
00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:37.067
And that for me
kind of woke me up
a little bit.

724
00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:38.600
And when I turned 14.

725
00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:40.700
I really started
to focus on things

726
00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:42.133
that were happening
in my own backyard.

727
00:37:42.167 --> 00:37:44.433
which was
the Great Barrier Reef
where I grew up diving.

728
00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:46.300
and I had no idea
that there were things

729
00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:49.167
threatening
what I always thought
was a Marine Park.

730
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.900
Queensland...

731
00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:56.067
They're just killing sharks.

732
00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:57.733
They've got drumlines

733
00:37:57.767 --> 00:38:00.233
in the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park.

734
00:38:01.533 --> 00:38:05.300
One of the seven natural
wonders of the world.

735
00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:08.533
We're not just fishing it
and wiping it out.

736
00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:10.200
We're not just
coral bleaching it

737
00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:11.433
and wiping it out.

738
00:38:11.467 --> 00:38:14.967
We're killing the doctors
of the reef.

739
00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:18.700
The animals that keep
the whole ecosystem
in check.

740
00:38:18.733 --> 00:38:20.267
Now what does that tell you

741
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.267
about the future
of our Great Barrier Reef

742
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.833
in our Australian waters?

743
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:33.733
[Bana] As politicians
debate human lives
versus shark lives.

744
00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:37.067
protecting our ocean
versus tourism dollars.

745
00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:39.700
there is something
we've all been missing.

746
00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:42.933
One simple question
in this whole culling debate

747
00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:46.167
that has only
very recently been asked.

748
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.967
Is it even legal?

749
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.367
[Lawrence Chlebeck]
So a few years back.

750
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.600
the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park Authority
issued a permit

751
00:38:57.633 --> 00:38:59.800
for Queensland's
Agriculture and Fisheries

752
00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:02.233
to operate
173 lethal drumlines

753
00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:04.267
within the boundaries
of the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park.

754
00:39:06.067 --> 00:39:08.367
So we had a look
at that permit and we realized

755
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.733
that allowing the lethal take
of apex predators

756
00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:13.433
within a World Heritage Area.

757
00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:15.067
Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park.

758
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.700
was in direct violation

759
00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:19.633
of the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park's mandate

760
00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:23.167
to protect the ecological
viability of the reef.

761
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.767
We had a look at that permit.
and we're trying to
investigate

762
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.633
if there was any legal
recourse we could take
to challenge that.

763
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:36.333
So we called our good friends.
the Environmental
Defenders Office.

764
00:39:36.367 --> 00:39:38.300
we attempted to find
a middle ground

765
00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:40.900
with Queensland Fisheries
and were unable to do so.

766
00:39:40.933 --> 00:39:42.967
And that's when we learned

767
00:39:43.067 --> 00:39:45.567
that within the bounds
of the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal.

768
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.367
we would be able
to challenge that permit.

769
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500
In court.
we built our argument
around two facets.

770
00:40:00.533 --> 00:40:03.367
The first of which is that
removing apex predators

771
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.500
from a World Heritage Area
and protected ecosystem

772
00:40:06.533 --> 00:40:09.300
is not a good way to protect
that ecosystem.

773
00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:12.300
And second of all.
and probably most importantly.

774
00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:16.600
is that shark culling
has no impact
on swimmer safety.

775
00:40:16.633 --> 00:40:18.567
The Queensland Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries'

776
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.933
own expert witness
admitted on the stand

777
00:40:20.967 --> 00:40:22.133
that if the lethal component

778
00:40:22.167 --> 00:40:24.200
of the Shark Control Program
was ended tomorrow.

779
00:40:24.233 --> 00:40:26.033
it would have no impact
on swimmer safety.

780
00:40:28.433 --> 00:40:30.733
We got a ten minute heads-up
from our lawyers

781
00:40:30.767 --> 00:40:32.800
that the decision
was coming down.

782
00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:36.333
And so it's ten minutes
of stressful waiting.

783
00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:39.900
and then. when we finally
get the document
and we're reading through it.

784
00:40:39.933 --> 00:40:42.333
not completely understanding
the technical jargon.

785
00:40:42.367 --> 00:40:46.233
and then we're all coming
at the same time slowly
to this realization.

786
00:40:46.267 --> 00:40:48.367
holy [inaudible].
we won.

787
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.833
Sharks caught on drumlines
will no longer be killed

788
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:53.500
but tagged and released

789
00:40:53.533 --> 00:40:55.300
following a significant
court win

790
00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:57.000
by environmentalists.

791
00:40:57.033 --> 00:40:59.833
While the ruling is limited
to the Great Barrier Reef
for now.

792
00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:02.567
experts want
the decision expanded.

793
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.400
[Lawrence] The tribunal
found the evidence

794
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:09.933
that shark culling
had no scientific basis

795
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:15.067
and had no proof
to be reducing the risk
of shark bite.

796
00:41:15.067 --> 00:41:16.733
and that this program

797
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.600
was negatively
impacting the health
of the Great Barrier Reef.

798
00:41:19.633 --> 00:41:24.133
They found evidence
to those points to be.
quote. "Overwhelming".

799
00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:25.800
And in any other circumstance.

800
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:27.667
this would have been
a Hollywood mic drop.

801
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.767
end-of-the-movie moment.

802
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.900
[Dr. Leonardo] The Queensland
government's reaction.

803
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.200
I don't know
how to describe it.

804
00:41:38.233 --> 00:41:41.100
It seemed very odd.

805
00:41:41.133 --> 00:41:43.900
There's an opportunity
to move forward. and...

806
00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:46.200
they stalled.

807
00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:49.300
We need to ensure
that we're putting people
before sharks.

808
00:41:49.333 --> 00:41:52.900
[man 1] The government
agrees. announcing
its plans to appeal.

809
00:41:52.933 --> 00:41:55.867
[man 2] We will always
put human life first.

810
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.833
The community
expectations. uh.

811
00:41:58.867 --> 00:42:01.400
that their beaches are kept
as safe as possible.

812
00:42:01.433 --> 00:42:02.767
Since 1962.

813
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.433
there has been one fatality.
that says it all to me.

814
00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:12.500
So Queensland
had this golden opportunity

815
00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:13.867
to take this decision

816
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.167
and really implement
some sweeping changes
across the program

817
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.733
that were better gonna
protect the public.

818
00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:22.500
better protect the ocean.
better protect the reef.

819
00:42:22.533 --> 00:42:24.900
But instead.
they really doubled down
on their position.

820
00:42:24.933 --> 00:42:27.567
and I guess
this is just indicative

821
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.667
of what we see all over
the world in politics today.

822
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.533
Politicians are doubling down

823
00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:34.733
on what they said
in the beginning and digging
themselves in holes

824
00:42:34.767 --> 00:42:35.867
further and further.

825
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.067
And shark culling
is no stranger to this.

826
00:42:39.067 --> 00:42:41.667
And it'll be so important.
this federal appeal.

827
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.467
as in if we can win that.
we'll really give them
no other option.

828
00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:48.600
[Bana] Inspite of all this.

829
00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:51.267
the Queensland Government
continues to refuse

830
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.067
to follow the overwhelming
evidence uncovered
in this case.

831
00:42:55.067 --> 00:42:58.600
Instead. simply moving
every single drumline

832
00:42:58.633 --> 00:43:01.400
they were forced to remove
from the Marine Park

833
00:43:01.433 --> 00:43:03.733
to just outside its borders.

834
00:43:05.233 --> 00:43:06.700
At the turn of the millennium.

835
00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:10.200
the Environment
Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act

836
00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:11.867
was introduced.

837
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.067
requiring any activities
harming protected species.

838
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.367
like the culling of great
whites. to seek approval.

839
00:43:21.367 --> 00:43:25.167
Due to a loophole in the Act.
anything lawful taking place

840
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.600
prior to the introduction
of the Act can continue.

841
00:43:28.633 --> 00:43:31.500
free from any formal
approval process.

842
00:43:31.533 --> 00:43:33.700
so long as it doesn't expand.

843
00:43:35.733 --> 00:43:38.933
New South Wales have held
their end of the bargain.

844
00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:41.067
keeping their program
the same size.

845
00:43:41.067 --> 00:43:44.767
51 beaches.
since the year 2000.

846
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.600
But Queensland
continues to push its luck

847
00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:48.833
with the law.

848
00:43:48.867 --> 00:43:51.200
They have expanded
and intensified

849
00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:53.467
the Shark Control Program
significantly

850
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.500
in the past 20 years.

851
00:43:55.533 --> 00:43:57.667
breaching the very loophole

852
00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.167
they used to avoid
needing official approval.

853
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.967
And they are suffering
zero consequences.

854
00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:08.233
This could well be
the next legal challenge
to culling.

855
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.800
[man 1 speaking indistinctly]

856
00:44:14.833 --> 00:44:16.700
[man 2]
Just come back here
with that camera for a minute.

857
00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:17.800
please. I haven't finished.

858
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:18.800
[man 1]
She's got certain...

859
00:44:18.833 --> 00:44:20.067
[overlapping chatter]

860
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.800
[man 1] ...concerns about
the safety of the operation.

861
00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:23.267
[man 2]
Oh. I want that camera.

862
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.633
[o overlapping chatter]

863
00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:30.400
[man 1]
So we'll just get your names
and addresses at this stage.

864
00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:34.867
And we'll get the full details
from the lady on board
the boat. okay?

865
00:44:48.833 --> 00:44:51.300
[Migah Lester] Back in 1992.
on Easter Monday.

866
00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:55.233
myself and two kids
from the neighborhood
were hanging out all day.

867
00:44:55.267 --> 00:44:57.600
One of them.
his name was Paul Rogers.

868
00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.533
And it was a typical hot day

869
00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:01.700
in the Easter holidays
on the Gold Coast.

870
00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:03.500
So we asked our parents
if we could go surfing.

871
00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:05.100
They said. "Yes."
as long as we surf

872
00:45:05.133 --> 00:45:07.600
right next
to the patrol flags.

873
00:45:07.633 --> 00:45:09.967
I had been surfing
the previous two weeks.

874
00:45:10.067 --> 00:45:13.933
so I knew
that there was a drumline
that had been washed in.

875
00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:15.267
I paddled out.

876
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.700
and I noticed my two friends
didn't get out of the back.

877
00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:21.167
And I was a little bit older.
I was 11.

878
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.167
so I was thinking. "Oh. maybe
they're just struggling

879
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.700
to get through the little
white waters.

880
00:45:24.733 --> 00:45:26.167
to get out the back."

881
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.867
But I drifted
into the patrol flags

882
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.500
where we're not allowed
to surf and I thought.

883
00:45:29.533 --> 00:45:31.600
"Okay. instead of paddling
against the current.

884
00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:34.133
I'll run around and see
if they're in the shore break
and I'll join them."

885
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.567
As I got to the beach.
I was running on the sand

886
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.200
and I'd seen a bunch
of lifeguards

887
00:45:42.233 --> 00:45:44.100
bringing Paul in.
carrying him in.

888
00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:46.067
My immediate thought
was. "Oh. wow.

889
00:45:46.067 --> 00:45:48.333
Paul is helping them
with their training."

890
00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:49.800
They put him down
on the ground.

891
00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:52.167
and the second
they put him on the ground.
they started CPR.

892
00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.900
The first thing I noticed was.
when I looked down at Paul.

893
00:46:00.933 --> 00:46:04.167
I could see his ankle
had these

894
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.667
really deep. intense...

895
00:46:06.833 --> 00:46:08.500
rope or cable marks

896
00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:10.567
that looked like it was
wrapped around his ankle.

897
00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:12.900
His eyes were open.

898
00:46:12.933 --> 00:46:14.633
and the guys who were
doing CPR were crying.

899
00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:16.633
and it all kind of.
like. sunk in. you know.

900
00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.600
We're just little kids
and it's like. "Oh. my God."

901
00:46:22.667 --> 00:46:25.933
It was the next morning
when I was heading
to the hospital to see him.

902
00:46:25.967 --> 00:46:29.300
and he was in intensive care.
and then on the radio.

903
00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:31.067
it came on
that he didn't make it.

904
00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:32.633
That's something
that I'll never forget.

905
00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:34.067
that I've always lived with.

906
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.067
I just don't...
I don't know. man. I just...

907
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.667
The audacity of that
Shark Control Program
or the people that run it.

908
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.467
to use Paul as a way
to bring in a ruling to
protect their own interests.

909
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.633
for them to use
his death as an excuse

910
00:46:48.667 --> 00:46:52.067
to just try and stop people
investigating what's going on.

911
00:46:52.067 --> 00:46:53.733
Do you know your negligence

912
00:46:53.767 --> 00:46:56.600
is directly responsible
for my friend's death?

913
00:46:56.633 --> 00:46:58.833
Like. directly responsible.

914
00:46:58.867 --> 00:47:00.433
There's no other way
to cut it.

915
00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:03.100
You put an object
in the water. it washed in.

916
00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:06.067
it was there for two weeks.
and you didn't remove it.

917
00:47:06.067 --> 00:47:08.167
You pass the blame
on to other people.

918
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.867
you pass the responsibility
to the lifeguards.

919
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.467
to the Surf Lifesaving Club.
You didn't get it out.

920
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.067
And you know. this equipment.

921
00:47:15.067 --> 00:47:16.567
when it gets washed in
and buried.

922
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.667
you can't get your
Shark Control boats in there.

923
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.433
And you don't go and cut them.

924
00:47:20.467 --> 00:47:22.967
like. why the hell
aren't you cutting them
and removing them?

925
00:47:23.067 --> 00:47:25.067
Why are they even there
in the first place?

926
00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:26.700
It just shows
where their intent lies.

927
00:47:26.733 --> 00:47:28.367
it shows it's not there
for protection.

928
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.167
it's there
for their own intent.

929
00:47:33.533 --> 00:47:35.400
I'd love to know the response

930
00:47:35.433 --> 00:47:37.267
from the actual people
that are in the water.

931
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.067
I'd love to hear
their opinions of it.

932
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.600
instead of a fisherman
whose job is to go out
and kill stuff.

933
00:47:43.067 --> 00:47:44.667
But what about all the rest
of us. you know?

934
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.933
We don't want marine animals

935
00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:49.267
being caught on hooks
and wrapped in nets

936
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.400
off where we're surfing
and swimming.

937
00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:54.567
It's like. the person
who's doing this. like.
where's your morals?

938
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.133
Like. where's your
heart in this?

939
00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:58.100
You say you're there
to protect us. but you're not.

940
00:47:58.133 --> 00:47:59.300
You're probably sitting
in an office.

941
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:01.067
You're not the one
in the lineups.

942
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.067
you're not the one
whose kid is surfing there.

943
00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:06.367
Have you even taken
into consideration
how his mum feels?

944
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.467
No. She's. like.
an amazing woman
with an amazing kid.

945
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.500
Like. Paul was the nicest kid
you could ever meet.

946
00:48:13.533 --> 00:48:17.400
And you took that away.
He'd be 38 today.

947
00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:20.933
And now 22 years later.
you wanna bring a rule in
that just protects yourself.

948
00:48:20.967 --> 00:48:24.400
It has no interest
in protecting anyone else.

949
00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:27.267
So it really shows
what your true colors are.

950
00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.100
[man 1]
A teenager is. tonight.
counting his lucky stars.

951
00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:49.400
after coming
within centimeters
of the jaws of a shark.

952
00:48:49.433 --> 00:48:53.667
He'd been surfing
off Bribie Island.
when the predator struck.

953
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.067
[man 2] 18 drumlines
along Bribie Island

954
00:48:56.067 --> 00:48:58.067
keep the public
relatively safe.

955
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.600
but they can't stop
every shark.

956
00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:10.367
[man 3] In Queensland.
history shows us.

957
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.067
and the CSIRO
has published data.

958
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.867
to show that in the 1930s.

959
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.933
there were
a considerable number
of shark bite incidences

960
00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:20.900
on the Queensland coast.
including the Gold Coast.

961
00:49:20.933 --> 00:49:23.933
In the 1930s. the 1940s.
the numbers were quite high.

962
00:49:23.967 --> 00:49:27.067
And then the numbers
started dropping off
in the '50s and the '60s.

963
00:49:27.067 --> 00:49:29.533
And since then. the numbers
have remained flat.

964
00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:32.967
So the numbers
have remained flat

965
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.500
from before the Shark Control
Program equipment

966
00:49:37.533 --> 00:49:40.067
has been deployed.

967
00:49:40.067 --> 00:49:43.833
And so you can't
put a causal link
between the low numbers

968
00:49:43.867 --> 00:49:46.567
and the Shark Control
Program equipment.

969
00:49:47.867 --> 00:49:51.900
[Paul] More people die from
drowning around Australia.

970
00:49:51.933 --> 00:49:56.367
So many more people die from
drowning around Australia

971
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.933
than die from sharks.

972
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.700
And yet. there's no
attention being brought
to the drowning problem.

973
00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:05.433
only killing of sharks.

974
00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:12.067
[Dr. Leonardo] When you look
at shark mitigation. you know.

975
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.800
just because you've been doing
something for so many years.

976
00:50:15.833 --> 00:50:17.833
doesn't mean
it's the right way.

977
00:50:17.867 --> 00:50:19.400
I mean. societies have changed

978
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:23.833
over a variety of issues
because cultures change.
perceptions change.

979
00:50:23.867 --> 00:50:25.900
technology changes.
knowledge changes.

980
00:50:25.933 --> 00:50:28.300
So when you look
at shark mitigation.

981
00:50:28.333 --> 00:50:30.867
if we use the analogy
of road safety.

982
00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.833
60 years ago. the road toll
was a lot higher.

983
00:50:33.867 --> 00:50:37.367
Since then.
we've gotten better
with car technology.

984
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.167
ABS braking. airbags.
road education.

985
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.067
people getting their licenses
has improved.

986
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.800
We've improved our road laws.

987
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.433
and we've reduced
the road toll.

988
00:50:45.467 --> 00:50:48.900
And guess what? We didn't
take cars off the road.

989
00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:51.233
So why would shark control
be any different?

990
00:50:51.267 --> 00:50:52.633
Why would we say.

991
00:50:52.667 --> 00:50:55.400
"No. let's stick
to what we've been doing
for the past 60 years.

992
00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:56.800
let's not move with the times.

993
00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:58.233
let's not move
with technology.

994
00:50:58.267 --> 00:50:59.867
let's not move with education.

995
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.200
let's not move
with the knowledge we get.

996
00:51:02.233 --> 00:51:04.333
and still go. "Oh. yeah.
but everything's fine?"

997
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.133
It does not make sense.

998
00:51:12.633 --> 00:51:15.600
[Jonathan] On our Gold Coast.
they're all for killing
animals in the ocean.

999
00:51:15.633 --> 00:51:17.100
in the name
of their tourism industry.

1000
00:51:17.133 --> 00:51:19.367
'cause they seem
to be scared down there

1001
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.067
of the day when the sharks
are going to walk out

1002
00:51:22.067 --> 00:51:23.533
on their fins.

1003
00:51:23.567 --> 00:51:26.067
on the beach.
and start biting people.

1004
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.600
It's more discouraging
here in Australia

1005
00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:30.367
than it is. for example.
in Indonesia.

1006
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.933
In Indonesia. I work with men

1007
00:51:31.967 --> 00:51:33.967
that spend weeks offshore
killing hundreds of sharks.

1008
00:51:34.067 --> 00:51:35.600
And I have more respect
for them.

1009
00:51:35.633 --> 00:51:37.667
because they're doing that
to feed their families.

1010
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.067
Whereas here. we're doing it
for a false sense of comfort.

1011
00:51:40.067 --> 00:51:42.567
We have absolutely
no right and no excuse

1012
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.633
to be treating our wildlife
the way that we do.

1013
00:51:44.667 --> 00:51:47.300
other than blind ignorance
and selfishness.

1014
00:51:47.333 --> 00:51:49.067
So it's far harder to respect

1015
00:51:49.067 --> 00:51:50.733
things that are occurring
in my own country.

1016
00:51:50.767 --> 00:51:52.533
and to see it
from their perspective.

1017
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:55.233
We react to sharks
like they're terrorists.

1018
00:51:55.267 --> 00:51:57.800
When I'm in America
and someone's been
bitten by a shark.

1019
00:51:57.833 --> 00:52:00.500
and when I lived in Hawaii.
and someone was bitten
by a shark.

1020
00:52:00.533 --> 00:52:03.067
everybody's like.
"Oh. well. he knew the risks.

1021
00:52:03.067 --> 00:52:04.967
And this is their home.
not ours."

1022
00:52:05.067 --> 00:52:07.400
But in Australia.
it's so different. It's like.

1023
00:52:07.433 --> 00:52:09.467
"We're out for blood now.
Revenge time."

1024
00:52:10.533 --> 00:52:13.133
Our biggest mistake.
being public Australians

1025
00:52:13.167 --> 00:52:15.333
that interact with these
animals every day.

1026
00:52:15.367 --> 00:52:17.633
is putting our faith
in the government
to protect us.

1027
00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.067
because that is not
their goal.

1028
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.067
And so far. they've not been
successful with that.

1029
00:52:28.067 --> 00:52:31.167
[Bana] Sharks aren't the
only victims of the cull.

1030
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.333
At some beaches.
up to 97% of animals
caught in the nets

1031
00:52:36.367 --> 00:52:38.967
are made up of other
innocent marine life.

1032
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.433
Whales. dolphins.
rays. turtles.

1033
00:52:46.733 --> 00:52:49.967
Animals that are loved
all around the world.

1034
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.733
Animals that are on the
endangered species list.

1035
00:52:56.067 --> 00:52:59.867
Animals that are supposed
to be protected in our waters.

1036
00:53:09.967 --> 00:53:13.400
Shark culling has many
destructive. unintended
consequences

1037
00:53:13.433 --> 00:53:15.500
and it's mostly coming
from by-catch.

1038
00:53:15.533 --> 00:53:18.233
Um. whales. dolphins.
turtles. rays.

1039
00:53:18.267 --> 00:53:20.733
and all of these animals
are incredibly vital

1040
00:53:20.767 --> 00:53:22.100
to these ocean ecosystems

1041
00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:24.600
that are already
under so much stress.

1042
00:53:24.633 --> 00:53:26.633
[Madison]
So the very first time
I went out to the shark nets

1043
00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:28.567
was on this dodgy little
dinghy with a friend of mine

1044
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.067
in really rough weather.
and I saw
three dead stingrays.

1045
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.533
and it was just
this huge wake-up call of.

1046
00:53:33.567 --> 00:53:34.967
how on earth
is this happening

1047
00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:36.067
and how are people
ignoring it?

1048
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.267
I think that the whales
being caught

1049
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.167
is probably the only thing
that really makes the public
look at them and think.

1050
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.867
"Oh. wow. that's terrible."

1051
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.667
And since then.
I've had the opportunity

1052
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.333
to go out there and see
the damage they're doing

1053
00:53:46.367 --> 00:53:47.733
off our coastline a lot more.

1054
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:50.233
So it's been one
of the hardest things

1055
00:53:50.267 --> 00:53:52.933
that I've ever had to come up
against in conservation
as well.

1056
00:53:52.967 --> 00:53:56.800
because you're dealing
with something people think
protects them.

1057
00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:59.300
If you could see
all the other stuff
caught in them.

1058
00:53:59.333 --> 00:54:00.267
it's insane.

1059
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.500
[groaning]

1060
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:09.367
[squeaking and grunting]

1061
00:56:32.167 --> 00:56:36.833
[squeaking and grunting
continue]

1062
00:57:44.067 --> 00:57:46.800
[Holly] The day that I found
a humpback whale

1063
00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:48.367
caught in a shark net

1064
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.900
was possibly one
of the worst days of my life.

1065
00:57:52.933 --> 00:57:56.900
To see this animal
that we see on our coastlines.

1066
00:57:56.933 --> 00:57:59.600
breaching and slapping
and playing.

1067
00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:03.300
and to see one
physically wrapped in a net

1068
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:05.600
in just silence there. um.

1069
00:58:05.633 --> 00:58:08.100
doing a behavior
that obviously
I've never seen before.

1070
00:58:08.133 --> 00:58:09.167
it was just.

1071
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.400
it was hopeless.
and it was just sitting there.

1072
00:58:11.433 --> 00:58:13.567
um. just able to breathe
on the surface.

1073
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.933
So getting in the water
with that whale

1074
00:58:15.967 --> 00:58:18.600
was the first time
I've ever swam with a whale.

1075
00:58:18.633 --> 00:58:21.367
And it was just still.

1076
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.200
and it would just
come up for breaths
every now and then.

1077
00:58:24.233 --> 00:58:28.467
And I remember
the rope just being

1078
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.633
entangled around its face.
rubbing on its eye.

1079
00:58:31.667 --> 00:58:34.167
and there was nothing
I could have done.

1080
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.933
It was physically exhausted.

1081
00:58:35.967 --> 00:58:38.933
You could see.
along the dorsal fin.
along the spine.

1082
00:58:38.967 --> 00:58:40.967
it was cut in. bleeding.

1083
00:58:41.067 --> 00:58:43.300
And just looking
at its face as well.

1084
00:58:43.333 --> 00:58:46.533
just being completely
entangled in that net.
was really horrible to see.

1085
00:58:46.567 --> 00:58:48.067
And it was one
of those moments

1086
00:58:48.067 --> 00:58:50.500
where you wanted
to get closer
to look at it more.

1087
00:58:50.533 --> 00:58:53.333
but at the same time.
this animal is
highly stressed.

1088
00:59:00.067 --> 00:59:02.500
Humpback whales will migrate
past this coastline

1089
00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:03.767
every year during winter.

1090
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.067
And they basically will go up

1091
00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:07.433
to the Northern Great
Barrier Reef.

1092
00:59:07.467 --> 00:59:09.833
give birth to their young
and migrate down south.

1093
00:59:09.867 --> 00:59:13.167
and they're doing this
on a limited budget of energy.

1094
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.233
So there's no food sources

1095
00:59:15.267 --> 00:59:17.200
along this coastline
for these guys.

1096
00:59:17.233 --> 00:59:18.967
And it's very important
for them

1097
00:59:19.067 --> 00:59:20.667
to use their energy wisely

1098
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.933
and if they are
entangled in a net.

1099
00:59:22.967 --> 00:59:26.367
that takes a lot of energy.
a lot of stress.

1100
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.533
We never found our target
species in the shark nets.

1101
00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:32.600
And the rest
were all by-catch.

1102
00:59:32.633 --> 00:59:34.200
That takes a toll on you
as well.

1103
00:59:34.233 --> 00:59:37.567
because you're in the water
filming these animals.

1104
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.500
We're mentally prepared
for the by-catch.

1105
00:59:39.533 --> 00:59:42.267
but nowhere near as much
as what we actually found.

1106
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.367
So that was something
that really sort of hit home.

1107
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.533
is realizing that
we were finding animals

1108
00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:52.167
that we didn't think
that we would find.

1109
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.667
I've had the experience
of listening to the
footage afterwards

1110
00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.567
where I've. uh.

1111
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.867
I've been the captain
on the boat.

1112
01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.600
I was managing the operation.

1113
01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:07.833
I have this dedicated crew
of people who.

1114
01:00:07.867 --> 01:00:09.333
by the nature
of what we're doing.

1115
01:00:09.367 --> 01:00:12.600
these are people
who care deeply
about everything that we do

1116
01:00:12.633 --> 01:00:15.767
and about every one
of those individual animals.

1117
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.867
And. um...

1118
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.367
I've had to listen
to the responses of my divers.

1119
01:00:24.367 --> 01:00:29.533
[diver crying]

1120
01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:05.333
When I look
at that footage afterwards.

1121
01:01:05.367 --> 01:01:07.767
I might not know
what's going on underwater.

1122
01:01:08.633 --> 01:01:10.800
except for what I'm told.

1123
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:16.433
But when I listen to a diver
crying underwater. um...

1124
01:01:16.467 --> 01:01:20.433
When I listened to a diver
spontaneously apologize

1125
01:01:20.467 --> 01:01:23.433
to the animals under there.

1126
01:01:23.467 --> 01:01:25.067
it gets me

1127
01:01:25.067 --> 01:01:28.633
when I'm sitting there
in my living room.
watching it on a computer.

1128
01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.167
to try and get
that message out.

1129
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.700
How do we do that.
uh. effectively?

1130
01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:37.600
Uh. and how do I
look after my crew

1131
01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:39.833
when we're doing that?

1132
01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:41.367
And we're not just
doing it once.

1133
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.767
We're doing it again
and again and again.

1134
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.967
[Bana] By baiting and trapping
marine animals

1135
01:02:08.067 --> 01:02:10.300
with only
intermittent checking.

1136
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:11.733
nets and drumlines

1137
01:02:11.767 --> 01:02:14.433
are creating
a floating seafood buffet

1138
01:02:14.467 --> 01:02:16.200
for our apex predators.

1139
01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:20.367
There's evidence to show
that because of this.

1140
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.467
these measures are luring
large sharks closer to shore

1141
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.333
for an easy meal.

1142
01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:28.067
Given the proven
ineffectiveness

1143
01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:29.133
of these measures

1144
01:02:29.167 --> 01:02:30.500
in the first place.

1145
01:02:30.533 --> 01:02:33.733
logic tells us
that we have to question

1146
01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:37.433
how safe
this is really keeping us.

1147
01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:40.600
There's always a bigger.
hungrier fish out there.

1148
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.700
Do we really want to be
enticing them to our beaches?

1149
01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:52.067
[Holly] Through our findings.
we found animals

1150
01:02:52.067 --> 01:02:54.067
that were there
for more than a week.

1151
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.633
that had fully started
to decompose.

1152
01:02:56.667 --> 01:03:00.500
The chemicals and the smells
are leeching into the water

1153
01:03:00.533 --> 01:03:01.800
from the entanglements.

1154
01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:04.733
and same goes
for the baited drumlines.

1155
01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:06.933
You're gonna be luring sharks
closer to shore.

1156
01:03:08.933 --> 01:03:12.267
[man] So let's go back
to putting baited hooks

1157
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.333
just off the surf break.
just off the swimming beaches.

1158
01:03:15.367 --> 01:03:17.333
Does that actually make sense?

1159
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.333
[Paul] I've actually worked
with the DPI

1160
01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:22.967
in New South Wales
on their SMART drumlines

1161
01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:24.700
for a very brief period
of time.

1162
01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:27.533
And these drumlines
are attracting sharks in.

1163
01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:29.300
Now. they said they wouldn't.

1164
01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:31.067
but when I was
out there on the boat.

1165
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.500
we caught two great whites
on the same hook

1166
01:03:35.533 --> 01:03:37.733
within a matter of minutes.

1167
01:03:37.767 --> 01:03:41.433
And this was half a kilometer
from a popular swimming beach.

1168
01:03:41.467 --> 01:03:42.967
So what does that tell you

1169
01:03:43.067 --> 01:03:45.867
about what these drumlines
are attracting

1170
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.133
to their baited hooks?

1171
01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:50.867
[Holly] Not only is it
the deceased animals

1172
01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.800
that are luring sharks
close to shore.

1173
01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:56.367
The stressed animals.
sharks can sense that.

1174
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.667
They can sense
the vibrations and pulses

1175
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.567
through their sensory system.
that there is an animal
in distress

1176
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.567
that could potentially
be a prey item.

1177
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.567
So if it's dead or alive.

1178
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600
any animal
caught in a shark net.

1179
01:04:07.633 --> 01:04:09.333
a shark passing by

1180
01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:11.433
is most likely
going to come over

1181
01:04:11.467 --> 01:04:13.900
and be curious
about what's in this net.

1182
01:04:18.167 --> 01:04:21.133
And through the entanglement
that I witnessed at Noosa
the other day.

1183
01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:23.167
those beaches are not cleared.

1184
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.300
Now I'll tell you.
at Noosa.

1185
01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:26.567
we know that there was
a large shark under that net.

1186
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.233
And of course.

1187
01:04:28.267 --> 01:04:31.833
an injured. stressed animal
is going to be an attractant
for that predator.

1188
01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:35.067
Was the beach cleared?
No. it wasn't.

1189
01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:38.200
When that wire was left
at Bilinga Beach.

1190
01:04:38.233 --> 01:04:41.200
on the sea floor
after it died.
were the beaches cleared?

1191
01:04:41.233 --> 01:04:44.133
Was there an education program
put in place?

1192
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:44.967
No. there wasn't.

1193
01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.500
Uh. there was one particular
time where we found

1194
01:05:01.533 --> 01:05:03.833
a shovelnose ray
caught in the bottom

1195
01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:06.700
of the Surfers Paradise net
on the Gold Coast.

1196
01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:10.767
And this ray had humongous
bite marks out of it.

1197
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.567
So this large shovelnose ray
was about two to three meters.

1198
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.833
We checked all the nets
on the Gold Coast that day

1199
01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.967
and there was no shark
in any of the shark nets.

1200
01:05:21.067 --> 01:05:22.967
and that raises the question

1201
01:05:23.067 --> 01:05:25.567
that this animal
was caught in this net.

1202
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.533
the shark had managed
to maneuver around the net

1203
01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:31.267
without becoming
entangled in it.

1204
01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:36.467
[man] A monster shark
measuring more than
five meters

1205
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.067
is lurking
off North Stradbroke Island.

1206
01:05:39.067 --> 01:05:40.933
The Bligh government's
released photos

1207
01:05:40.967 --> 01:05:43.967
showing how it mauled
another large white pointer.

1208
01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:47.067
[woman] Like a bit of bait
on a hook.

1209
01:05:47.067 --> 01:05:48.733
the predator.
which became a meal

1210
01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:50.167
for an even bigger shark.

1211
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.067
after being caught
on a drumline

1212
01:05:52.067 --> 01:05:54.267
about half an hour
from where Sarah Whiley

1213
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.067
was killed by a shark
at Amity.

1214
01:05:56.067 --> 01:05:57.867
the state government's
take on it

1215
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.500
is that we should be happy
the Shark Control Program's
doing its job.

1216
01:06:01.533 --> 01:06:04.233
catching the smaller shark
in the first place.

1217
01:06:04.267 --> 01:06:07.067
But what about the monster
which feasted on it?

1218
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.900
When you tell people
that an area is safer.

1219
01:06:16.933 --> 01:06:19.733
when you haven't indeed
made it safer.

1220
01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:22.767
that leads human beings
to make decisions.

1221
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.933
to do things
they feel confident
there's less risk in.

1222
01:06:25.967 --> 01:06:27.767
and there may be more risk.

1223
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.067
It leads people
to take extra risk.

1224
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.900
I learned to surf
just there. at Manly Beach.

1225
01:06:41.933 --> 01:06:44.067
right there
in the southern corner
in front of the surf club.

1226
01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.067
My dad was a clubbie
at Manly Surf Club.

1227
01:06:46.067 --> 01:06:48.600
My older brother Jason
is a surfer.

1228
01:06:48.633 --> 01:06:50.800
Any girl that grows up
with an older brother surfing.

1229
01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:52.233
they wanna do it
with them. too.

1230
01:06:52.267 --> 01:06:54.967
I can honestly say
I do it a little bit better
than my brother.

1231
01:06:59.067 --> 01:07:02.133
[Tom]
So the ocean is kind of
like a spiritual home for me.

1232
01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:06.167
My mother gave me a surfboard
just before she passed away.

1233
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.367
So in essence. that surfboard
took me into the ocean.

1234
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.367
so the ocean has been
kind of holding me

1235
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.633
and the surfboard's been
holding me since.

1236
01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:16.600
in a way. that. um...

1237
01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.767
Yeah. I don't know.
It's hard to explain it.

1238
01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:21.700
It's definitely
an on-the-moment thing.

1239
01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:23.233
that the ocean just tells us

1240
01:07:23.267 --> 01:07:25.333
how to actually
be really present with her.

1241
01:07:25.367 --> 01:07:27.900
And I think that's why
I kind of go back to her.

1242
01:07:27.933 --> 01:07:32.067
because she just absolutely
demands all my attention.

1243
01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:37.067
[Layne] When I'm out here
at Freshwater. for example.

1244
01:07:37.067 --> 01:07:39.400
and I talk to local surfers.
and I ask them.

1245
01:07:39.433 --> 01:07:41.367
"What's your position
on sharks

1246
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.867
and shark mitigation."

1247
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.533
one of them said to me today.

1248
01:07:44.567 --> 01:07:47.100
"See no evil. hear no evil.
speak no evil."

1249
01:07:49.567 --> 01:07:51.200
I'm seven times
world champion surfer

1250
01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.833
and chair
of Surfing Australia.

1251
01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:55.467
and I completely understand

1252
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.400
that the minute
I immerse myself in the water.

1253
01:07:57.433 --> 01:08:01.067
I'm immersing myself
into their environment.
their domain.

1254
01:08:01.067 --> 01:08:04.167
and you have to accept
that they're a predator.

1255
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.800
I feel that that mentality
is widely respected

1256
01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.233
around the world
in most surfers.

1257
01:08:10.267 --> 01:08:12.733
I can't speak
on behalf of every surfer.

1258
01:08:12.767 --> 01:08:16.100
but I know from
my individual perspective.

1259
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.333
I recognize that there is
an inherent risk

1260
01:08:18.367 --> 01:08:19.867
every time I enter the water.

1261
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.067
I do what I can
to mitigate that risk.

1262
01:08:22.067 --> 01:08:24.533
but I'm also willing
to take that risk.

1263
01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:33.900
My desire to surf
is unwavering.

1264
01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:35.767
irrespective of whether
there's nets there or not.

1265
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.133
Having traveled the world
as a professional surfer.

1266
01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:40.067
I've surfed
in countless oceans

1267
01:08:40.067 --> 01:08:42.800
and countless surf spots
where I know there aren't nets

1268
01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:45.133
and that has never affected
my choice to go surfing

1269
01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:47.233
or my decision to go surfing.

1270
01:08:47.267 --> 01:08:50.633
[Tom] I take personal
responsibility anytime.

1271
01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.567
I think that's our...

1272
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.233
I hope that's our culture
here in Australia. you know.

1273
01:08:55.267 --> 01:08:59.067
I hope to think
every Australian
can think like this.

1274
01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:03.133
To be honest.
I've been surfing

1275
01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:04.933
for. what. 51 years now.

1276
01:09:04.967 --> 01:09:07.567
And while surfing.
I may have seen...

1277
01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:11.600
five sharks.

1278
01:09:11.633 --> 01:09:14.367
Not just surfing part-time.
[laughs]

1279
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.900
That's surfing a lot.

1280
01:09:15.933 --> 01:09:18.200
In remote areas
around this country

1281
01:09:18.233 --> 01:09:20.067
where you're gonna see sharks.

1282
01:09:21.267 --> 01:09:22.333
When we look at the shark.

1283
01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:25.067
which has been around here
for millions of years.

1284
01:09:25.067 --> 01:09:27.100
it's literally a dinosaur.

1285
01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:31.133
it may appear to us to be
a really dangerous creature

1286
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.167
and bring up a lot of fear.

1287
01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.067
I've had first-hand
experience with that.

1288
01:09:37.067 --> 01:09:39.400
I looked him straight
in the eye. Big sharks.

1289
01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:44.433
And they've had. uh. a kind
of response to me like.

1290
01:09:44.467 --> 01:09:46.800
"Hmm. that person's
a predator. too."

1291
01:09:53.233 --> 01:09:58.267
[Layne]
There's a very low chance
of being bitten by a shark.

1292
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.133
Like. the chances
are very slim. very slender.

1293
01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:03.467
You have a higher incidence
of being hit by a car

1294
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.000
or stung by a bee
and dying from that

1295
01:10:06.033 --> 01:10:08.300
than you do a shark attack.

1296
01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:10.967
I'm a believer and an advocate
for coexisting.

1297
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.567
Uh. we know. as ocean lovers.

1298
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.200
that once we immerse
ourselves in the ocean.

1299
01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:16.633
we're going
into a shark domain.

1300
01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:20.667
and we have to recognize
that that is one of the risks

1301
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.133
that we're willing to accept.

1302
01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:28.333
Given we know
what we know today.

1303
01:10:28.367 --> 01:10:30.633
it is absolutely archaic

1304
01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:32.833
that we're relying
on a program

1305
01:10:32.867 --> 01:10:34.700
that was devised in 1930.

1306
01:10:34.733 --> 01:10:36.833
When I think
about culling programs.

1307
01:10:36.867 --> 01:10:39.267
I just think it must come
from a lack of education

1308
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.067
and a cultural belief.

1309
01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.467
So if you really wanna
truly educate yourself.

1310
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.067
get off your board
and dive underneath

1311
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.900
and spend some time
on the bottom.

1312
01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:50.567
[Tom] We're
sophisticating ourselves

1313
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.967
in so many areas now.

1314
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.667
We've got a lot
of great technologies

1315
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.267
and they just
keep on evolving.

1316
01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.500
We've got to tap into that.

1317
01:10:58.533 --> 01:11:02.933
and so we can live with nature
because we are nature.

1318
01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:04.533
If we can use technology

1319
01:11:04.567 --> 01:11:07.100
to actually create
that scenario.

1320
01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:08.633
I think that's ideal.

1321
01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:14.067
[water splashing]

1322
01:11:14.067 --> 01:11:15.667
I think New South Wales.

1323
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.067
the shark management
program here

1324
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.567
and the shark
management strategy

1325
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.067
is in very much
a transition phase.

1326
01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:24.133
And it has been
for probably a decade now.

1327
01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:26.833
where it's moving away
from lethal controls

1328
01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:29.700
like shark nets
and lethal drumlines.

1329
01:11:29.733 --> 01:11:32.767
So SMART drumlines have been
used for a few years down here

1330
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.300
in New South Wales.

1331
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.633
A SMART drumline
is very similar

1332
01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:36.867
to a traditional drumline.

1333
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.867
It's a baited hook
on a floating buoy

1334
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.833
about 500 meters off shore.

1335
01:11:41.867 --> 01:11:44.267
The differences is that
this has a GPS transceiver

1336
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.833
that sends a message
to a satellite

1337
01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:47.233
once an animal is hooked.

1338
01:11:47.267 --> 01:11:49.700
that sends another message
down to the contractor.

1339
01:11:49.733 --> 01:11:51.067
who can race out there.

1340
01:11:51.067 --> 01:11:53.367
uh. preferably or hopefully
within about 30 minutes

1341
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.833
of an animal being caught.

1342
01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:57.133
Um. if it's a
non-target animal.

1343
01:11:57.167 --> 01:12:00.067
it's released
on the spot immediately.

1344
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.733
And if it is a target shark.

1345
01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.633
um. it can be tagged
and relocated.

1346
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.767
So there's a smartphone app
along with Shark Smart

1347
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.233
that will send people
a message. who have the app.

1348
01:12:10.267 --> 01:12:13.800
when a tagged shark
comes within the vicinity
of a listening station.

1349
01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:15.967
What it does is
it's changing attitudes.

1350
01:12:16.067 --> 01:12:18.333
It's allowing people
the option.

1351
01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.933
who want to choose a place
to bring their family.

1352
01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:22.800
or for them
to enjoy the ocean.

1353
01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:24.767
it allows them
to look on their phone.

1354
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.967
see if there's a shark
sighted in that area.

1355
01:12:27.067 --> 01:12:29.400
and it allows them to make
that decision independently

1356
01:12:29.433 --> 01:12:31.900
and bring some of that
responsibility home.

1357
01:12:31.933 --> 01:12:33.067
And I think that change
of attitude

1358
01:12:33.067 --> 01:12:34.800
is very. very important
for us to start

1359
01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:37.100
not relying so much
on the government

1360
01:12:37.133 --> 01:12:39.933
making decisions for us.
but providing information

1361
01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:43.300
so that we can make those
informed decisions on our own.

1362
01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:46.367
We are still concerned about
animal welfare of sharks

1363
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.667
and other animals being caught
on the SMART drumlines

1364
01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.100
and how healthy they are
once they're released.

1365
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.567
[Madison] We're not the only
country with this issue.

1366
01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.333
There are countries
all around the world

1367
01:12:58.367 --> 01:13:00.500
that are tackling
it differently.

1368
01:13:00.533 --> 01:13:02.200
And when you look
at those systems.

1369
01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:05.267
it's insane to think
that we haven't started
doing that here yet.

1370
01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.967
There are systems getting
worked on in Australia

1371
01:13:08.067 --> 01:13:10.067
and all around the world
to protect people

1372
01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:12.433
against this very issue
of shark attacks.

1373
01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:14.967
and some of them
are far more effective.

1374
01:13:15.067 --> 01:13:16.300
provenly effective

1375
01:13:16.333 --> 01:13:18.067
than what we have here
right now.

1376
01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:24.867
[Bana] Right here
in Australia.

1377
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.267
and in other places
around the world.

1378
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.833
we are developing
less destructive

1379
01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:31.867
and more effective technology

1380
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.267
to protect us
while enjoying our oceans.

1381
01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.100
Solutions that actually
protect people

1382
01:13:38.133 --> 01:13:41.067
and have no unintended
side effects.

1383
01:13:41.067 --> 01:13:44.400
establishing a safer future
for both humans

1384
01:13:44.433 --> 01:13:46.400
and sharks to coexist.

1385
01:13:56.067 --> 01:13:58.267
So we started out
very early on

1386
01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.867
in a lot of the New South
Wales Government trials.

1387
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.500
and just seeing if drones
could actually be used

1388
01:14:03.533 --> 01:14:07.133
to spot sharks
and how we could
use that for mitigation.

1389
01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:09.967
So from very early phases
through to working out.

1390
01:14:10.067 --> 01:14:11.333
like. if it could be used

1391
01:14:11.367 --> 01:14:14.300
to developing standard
operating procedures.
at what heights.

1392
01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:16.233
um. and what we could
actually see.

1393
01:14:16.267 --> 01:14:18.700
then we've sort of developed
with that program.

1394
01:14:18.733 --> 01:14:23.333
Lifeguards literally have them
on the beach now as a tool.

1395
01:14:23.367 --> 01:14:25.267
so helping develop
their training packages

1396
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.467
and their procedures
in there as well.

1397
01:14:28.967 --> 01:14:30.767
Just after a few months
of starting.

1398
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.600
I noticed. starting
to read comments online

1399
01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:34.133
like. "Oh. we should to go
to this beach.

1400
01:14:34.167 --> 01:14:37.267
They have drone shark
surveillance and lifeguards."

1401
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.433
There's definitely
different technologies
that are coming along.

1402
01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:41.467
There's a few different
companies working with it.

1403
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.533
Australia is definitely
leading the way in this.

1404
01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:45.767
I think drone
technology is here.

1405
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.933
Like right now.
let's just use it.

1406
01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:58.067
Look. the way
the technology works

1407
01:14:58.067 --> 01:15:00.467
is actually
ridiculously simple.

1408
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.967
Um. sharks
have the same senses
that we have to find food.

1409
01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.933
So sight. sound. and smell.

1410
01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:09.067
but they also have
these little electrical
receptors in their snout

1411
01:15:09.067 --> 01:15:10.667
called Ampullae of Lorenzini.

1412
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.067
they're little
gel-filled sacs.

1413
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:15.333
Now every living creature
gives off an electric field.

1414
01:15:15.367 --> 01:15:18.333
And so you might see
in a nature video

1415
01:15:18.367 --> 01:15:20.867
a stingray swimming
along the sandy bottom

1416
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.667
and then digging down
and finding a crab.

1417
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.233
They found that crab

1418
01:15:24.267 --> 01:15:26.300
because of the electrical
field coming off the crab.

1419
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.600
So you can see how sensitive
these things are.

1420
01:15:28.633 --> 01:15:31.767
And so what you do
is you get two electrodes.

1421
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.800
you run a current
between the two electrodes.

1422
01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.933
and it creates
an electrical field

1423
01:15:35.967 --> 01:15:38.067
that's thousands
of times stronger

1424
01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.800
than what the shark
would expect to experience.

1425
01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.467
The shark comes near it.

1426
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.200
causes the gel-filled sacs
to spasm. turns away.

1427
01:15:45.233 --> 01:15:47.267
Exactly the same
as if I shine a bright light

1428
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.933
in your face. in your eyes.
you would just take turn away.

1429
01:15:49.967 --> 01:15:51.667
The eyes are over sensitized.

1430
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.533
So it doesn't harm the shark.
The shark can leave the area.

1431
01:15:54.567 --> 01:15:56.600
So the University
of Western Australia.

1432
01:15:56.633 --> 01:16:00.067
what they did is they got
the diving product.

1433
01:16:00.067 --> 01:16:03.233
They put a bait canister
on the device.

1434
01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.800
they took it to South Africa.

1435
01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:08.267
they had 322 interactions
with the bait.

1436
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.833
43 different
great white sharks.

1437
01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:13.700
and only one shark
bumped the bait

1438
01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:14.767
when it was on.

1439
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.133
When it was turned off.
the sharks would come in

1440
01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:17.800
and bite the bait
all the time.

1441
01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:20.133
So. amazingly successful.

1442
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.900
So the diving product

1443
01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:25.467
is the one that's
been around the longest.

1444
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.467
It was developed in the '90s.

1445
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.500
The surfboard product
is on generation number two.

1446
01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:33.900
and it's been around
for quite a while as well now.

1447
01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:36.567
[Juan] For me.
as a surfer.

1448
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.633
I would utilize
every type of device

1449
01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:41.400
that I could
to make it safer for me.

1450
01:16:41.433 --> 01:16:42.833
When you're going
to extreme areas

1451
01:16:42.867 --> 01:16:45.533
where you know there
is predators. uh.

1452
01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:49.367
hunting in that area.
it's use what you can.

1453
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.600
[Dr. Sara Andreotti]
The Shark Safe Barrier
is a new technology

1454
01:17:03.633 --> 01:17:06.600
that is designed
to simply keep large sharks

1455
01:17:06.633 --> 01:17:08.633
separated from people.

1456
01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:10.567
We've been observing
white sharks

1457
01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.100
hunting around
thick forest of kelp

1458
01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:15.733
for quite a while in Gansbaai
in South Africa.

1459
01:17:15.767 --> 01:17:18.933
and Cape fur seals
are actually utilizing

1460
01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:23.300
the thick kelp to hide
from shark's predation.

1461
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:26.767
The Shark Safe Barrier
comes from the combination

1462
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.700
of two very well-known
shark deterrents.

1463
01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:33.800
One is the visual appearance
of a thick forest of kelp

1464
01:17:33.833 --> 01:17:38.667
that have been proved
to be avoided by large sharks.

1465
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.500
We suspect that is
because they want to prevent

1466
01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:45.500
getting entangled in.
uh. thick forest of kelp.

1467
01:17:45.533 --> 01:17:47.067
So by presenting the shark

1468
01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:50.167
with something that they
naturally recognize
as a barrier

1469
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.400
is a big plus.

1470
01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.500
They know
they have to avoid it.

1471
01:17:53.533 --> 01:17:56.500
Then the second part
of the technology

1472
01:17:56.533 --> 01:18:00.367
that is a shark deterrent
are large ceramic magnets.

1473
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.167
The magnetism overwhelms
the sixth sense of the shark

1474
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.400
and acts as a deterrent.

1475
01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:12.800
We tested it by putting chum
on one side of the barrier.

1476
01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:16.067
a food source that the shark
can recognize as such.

1477
01:18:16.067 --> 01:18:19.500
to try and convince
the shark to swim through it.

1478
01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:22.267
But none of the experiments
we did.

1479
01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.100
any of the sharks
actually crossed the pipes.

1480
01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.933
It is shark-specific.

1481
01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:30.067
Every other marine animal
can just swim through it.

1482
01:18:30.067 --> 01:18:33.567
and it is designed
to protect surfers.

1483
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.700
There are other
eco-friendly systems

1484
01:18:36.733 --> 01:18:40.233
that can keep swimmers
separated from sharks.

1485
01:18:40.267 --> 01:18:42.700
but compared
to the Shark Safe.

1486
01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:46.333
they have the limitation
of being deployable only

1487
01:18:46.367 --> 01:18:47.967
in very calm weather.

1488
01:18:48.067 --> 01:18:51.433
While the Shark Safe Barrier.
once it's installed.

1489
01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:53.133
it's designed to stay there.

1490
01:18:53.167 --> 01:18:56.767
We can put it in deep water.
we can put it behind surfers.

1491
01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.400
to protect their back
as they're surfing.

1492
01:19:00.433 --> 01:19:03.300
We are really. really trying
as hard as we can

1493
01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:07.300
to have a minimal impact
to the environment

1494
01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.667
by providing
a solution that is safe

1495
01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.500
for both the marine life

1496
01:19:11.533 --> 01:19:13.433
and the people
using the beach.

1497
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.233
[Jonathan]
We could trail these
technologies concurrently

1498
01:19:23.267 --> 01:19:26.933
with the current Shark Control
Program over a season.

1499
01:19:26.967 --> 01:19:29.300
learn how to operate it.

1500
01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:33.300
give people the reassurance
that we're putting in
these non-lethals.

1501
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.867
monitor. do the science
on the non-lethals

1502
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.167
while you're doing it.

1503
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.567
You know. for example.

1504
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.133
have the drone technology

1505
01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:43.400
and record how often
you see sharks.

1506
01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:46.567
how often you make people
safer by bringing them in

1507
01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.233
to the beach.

1508
01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:50.433
and then tracking shark
and knowing when
you put them back out.

1509
01:19:50.467 --> 01:19:52.067
Let's do that science.

1510
01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:54.367
Do it while the nets
and drumlines are still
there for a season.

1511
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.233
There is a political answer
for you

1512
01:19:56.267 --> 01:19:59.367
that gives us a transition

1513
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.900
to a non-lethal
shark control program.

1514
01:20:02.933 --> 01:20:04.367
which I've gotta tell you.

1515
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.433
if we are concerned
about tourism in this state.

1516
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.933
progressive
and positive messages

1517
01:20:09.967 --> 01:20:12.333
about the way we treat
our wildlife

1518
01:20:12.367 --> 01:20:14.167
is going to be paramount.

1519
01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.133
[Madison]
The way that we treat
animals off our coastline.

1520
01:20:19.167 --> 01:20:22.367
the way that we walk around
like we own the ocean here.

1521
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.233
most countries
would be absolutely ecstatic

1522
01:20:26.267 --> 01:20:28.267
to have the kind
of wildlife that we do.

1523
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.700
and we just abuse
that privilege so much.

1524
01:20:31.733 --> 01:20:33.767
We ignore it as well.

1525
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.067
And I always remember
being in school

1526
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.133
and we had people come
talk to us about snakes.

1527
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:40.200
we had people come
talk to us about drugs.

1528
01:20:40.233 --> 01:20:42.267
and we had people
come talk to us about
all kinds of things.

1529
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.900
We had surf life savers
come talk to us about rips.

1530
01:20:44.933 --> 01:20:46.167
But nobody taught us
about sharks.

1531
01:20:48.933 --> 01:20:50.567
[Layne]
Education is key.

1532
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.533
And if we're uneducated.

1533
01:20:52.567 --> 01:20:55.300
then we tend
to just be ignorant.

1534
01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.700
And then we just go
with what we're told.

1535
01:20:57.733 --> 01:21:00.067
And unfortunately.
we're being told lies.

1536
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.967
we're being told...

1537
01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:03.900
We're actually
being fed bullshit

1538
01:21:03.933 --> 01:21:06.100
around what is feasible.

1539
01:21:06.133 --> 01:21:09.067
what's a feasible way
to mitigate the risk.

1540
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.367
There are wonderful
alternatives to culling.

1541
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.733
and I think that that starts

1542
01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.433
with education
in the community

1543
01:21:14.467 --> 01:21:17.167
on what they
as individual citizens can do

1544
01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.633
to avoid an adverse
interaction.

1545
01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:19.867
and educating them about

1546
01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.800
where it might be
safer to swim.

1547
01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:23.667
maybe employing
more lifesavers

1548
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.600
who would actually
save a lot more lives

1549
01:21:25.633 --> 01:21:26.900
than these culling practices.

1550
01:21:26.933 --> 01:21:29.200
which are probably
more endangering lives.

1551
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.100
As a surfer. swimmer.
diver. and ocean-goer.

1552
01:21:36.133 --> 01:21:39.067
there are things
that you can do to avoid
an adverse interaction.

1553
01:21:39.067 --> 01:21:42.067
reduce your chances
of encountering a shark.

1554
01:21:42.067 --> 01:21:44.200
And that's looking around
and being aware.

1555
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.267
Actually turning
your body around.

1556
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.767
And factoring in
environmental conditions

1557
01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.867
like your proximity to other
marine animals. runoff.

1558
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.067
rivers. stream outlets.
fishermen. fishing harbors.

1559
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.100
and minimizing splashing
on the surface.

1560
01:21:58.133 --> 01:22:01.067
and bright fluorescent colors
that make you stand out

1561
01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.633
amongst everything else.

1562
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.433
The Shark Control Program.
or basically stopping culling.

1563
01:22:09.467 --> 01:22:12.800
is one thing that we can do
relatively quick.

1564
01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:15.700
that will reduce
some of the pressure

1565
01:22:15.733 --> 01:22:17.667
that sharks face.

1566
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.400
In order to. I suppose.
formally make a decision

1567
01:22:20.433 --> 01:22:24.333
and then enact that decision.
um. that in itself takes time.

1568
01:22:24.367 --> 01:22:27.867
But we're hoping that sooner
rather than later. especially.

1569
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.733
you know. for people
who do use the water.

1570
01:22:29.767 --> 01:22:31.267
sooner rather than later.

1571
01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.933
effective safety measures
are put in place.

1572
01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:38.300
[Lawrence] So there are shark
advocates everywhere.

1573
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:41.267
I think anyone who's fortunate
enough. as I have been.

1574
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.233
to be able to spend
sometime in the water

1575
01:22:43.267 --> 01:22:44.467
with some of these animals.

1576
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.633
they'll all tell you what
a spiritual experience it is.

1577
01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:48.200
And you see their behavior.

1578
01:22:48.233 --> 01:22:50.633
and you see the thoughtfulness
behind their eyes.

1579
01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:52.667
And anyone that's been
able to experience that

1580
01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.300
immediately becomes
a shark advocate.

1581
01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:55.733
You just cannot help it.

1582
01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.433
[Juan] Kind of turning
that fear into a fascination

1583
01:22:59.467 --> 01:23:01.700
and that fascination
into. like. a healthy respect

1584
01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:03.567
to wanna do something
to help protect them.

1585
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.633
Especially once
you hear the information.

1586
01:23:05.667 --> 01:23:07.600
And I'm hoping that
can be an infective thing.

1587
01:23:07.633 --> 01:23:09.167
where other people
will do the same thing

1588
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.500
that I did. basically.

1589
01:23:10.533 --> 01:23:12.667
And that's what I'm trying
to do with my photography.

1590
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.600
It's just showing
that we can coexist.

1591
01:23:14.633 --> 01:23:16.900
that we can share the same
waters with these animals

1592
01:23:16.933 --> 01:23:18.300
and that we need
these animals.

1593
01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:20.500
Like. most people
just don't know the truth.

1594
01:23:20.533 --> 01:23:22.533
And if they did.
I have to feel like

1595
01:23:22.567 --> 01:23:24.233
they would make changes

1596
01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:25.933
in the way that
they consume things

1597
01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:28.067
and the way
that they would actually

1598
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.067
vote with their dollar
or even just with a voice.

1599
01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.067
just speaking up
for these animals.

1600
01:23:33.067 --> 01:23:34.667
They need it now
more than ever.

1601
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.267
I mean. if those studies
are even remotely close.

1602
01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.133
and 5% of the world's shark
population is all we got left.

1603
01:23:40.167 --> 01:23:43.600
then there's never
a more important time
to act than right now.

1604
01:23:45.667 --> 01:23:48.367
Every time
we enter the ocean.

1605
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.267
we're taking
our life in our hands.

1606
01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.433
because it is not
our backyard swimming pool.

1607
01:23:52.467 --> 01:23:54.633
Everything we do
to control nature

1608
01:23:54.667 --> 01:23:57.767
has a domino effect
that ripples down onto us.

1609
01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.067
So we have to take care
of this environment.

1610
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.800
we have to treasure our sharks

1611
01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:04.300
and understand exactly
what it is they do

1612
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:06.233
to keep their ecosystem
in check.

1613
01:24:10.433 --> 01:24:13.167
I hope that more people's
eyes will be open

1614
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.700
to the importance
of sharks. their plight.

1615
01:24:16.733 --> 01:24:18.567
and that people
will join together

1616
01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.400
and do something
to help protect them.

1617
01:24:20.433 --> 01:24:23.433
Just like what was done
for the protection of whales

1618
01:24:23.467 --> 01:24:25.733
and many marine animals
and cetaceans

1619
01:24:25.767 --> 01:24:27.433
and even turtles
around the world.

1620
01:24:27.467 --> 01:24:29.767
And I think that
I see the change already.

1621
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.867
especially with
the influence of media

1622
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.967
and different companies
getting on board
and getting involved.

1623
01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:38.433
Your voice matters.
you know.

1624
01:24:38.467 --> 01:24:39.600
especially 'cause
you don't know

1625
01:24:39.633 --> 01:24:41.067
what kind of chain reaction
it's gonna have.

1626
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.967
You don't know what kind
of seed it's gonna plant.

1627
01:24:43.067 --> 01:24:45.433
and. you know. the politicians
and the big businesses

1628
01:24:45.467 --> 01:24:46.833
will listen to the masses.

1629
01:24:46.867 --> 01:24:50.500
Start. Don't think that
you can't make a difference
because you can.

1630
01:24:52.467 --> 01:24:54.733
[Madison] The shark nets
are the one thing

1631
01:24:54.767 --> 01:24:59.067
that I have never
successfully dented.

1632
01:24:59.067 --> 01:25:01.300
It's just an insane enemy
to be up against.

1633
01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:04.067
So I've always been
at war with them

1634
01:25:04.067 --> 01:25:05.767
throughout my entire life.

1635
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.233
It's probably one
of the biggest wars

1636
01:25:07.267 --> 01:25:08.733
in shark conservation

1637
01:25:08.767 --> 01:25:11.067
because it is such
a delicate issue.

1638
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.633
It is just off our coastline.

1639
01:25:12.667 --> 01:25:14.500
but it's so hidden
from the public.

1640
01:25:14.533 --> 01:25:17.067
Making that awareness
possible is really difficult.

1641
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.700
And dealing
with people's mentalities
is really difficult.

1642
01:25:19.733 --> 01:25:21.100
So I don't know.

1643
01:25:21.133 --> 01:25:22.933
It's always been
a huge challenge to me.

1644
01:25:22.967 --> 01:25:24.967
and I feel pretty confident
in what I've been able to do

1645
01:25:25.067 --> 01:25:27.067
for sharks around the world.

1646
01:25:27.067 --> 01:25:30.300
but here.
it's one of those things

1647
01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.600
that I think I'll be battling
for the rest of my life.

1648
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.867
[Bana] Humans have shared
the oceans with these animals

1649
01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:46.133
for a mere fraction of their
450-million-year existence.

1650
01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:49.333
Sharks are the ultimate
apex predators.

1651
01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:54.667
They have survived and
adapted throughout ice ages.

1652
01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.467
heat waves.
and mass extinctions.

1653
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.667
to be the perfectly
evolved creatures

1654
01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.867
we share our oceans
with today.

1655
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.967
But there is one
mass extinction

1656
01:26:05.067 --> 01:26:08.233
they are struggling
to survive.

1657
01:26:08.267 --> 01:26:12.500
The one our arrogance.
entitlement. and fear
is fueling.

1658
01:26:15.067 --> 01:26:18.333
There are positive
changes being made.

1659
01:26:18.367 --> 01:26:23.367
driven by a dedicated few.
but we need more voices.

1660
01:26:25.333 --> 01:26:27.267
At this point in our history.

1661
01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.433
we know that we must
protect them.

1662
01:26:29.467 --> 01:26:32.933
not just for them to survive.
but for our own survival.

1663
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.500
Sharks will survive
just fine without us.

1664
01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:41.100
but we cannot survive
without them.

1665
01:26:42.433 --> 01:26:45.400
For their future and ours.

1666
01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:48.667
we must become their envoy.

1667
01:28:10.867 --> 01:28:16.267
[dramatic music playing]

1668
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.333
-Save the sharks.
-Save the sharks.

1669
01:28:18.367 --> 01:28:22.133
[man] Thousands held
protests in Melbourne
and Perth on Saturday.

1670
01:28:22.167 --> 01:28:24.333
They called on the
Western Australian Government

1671
01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:27.067
to abandon
the shark culling plan

1672
01:28:27.067 --> 01:28:28.967
announced last month.

1673
01:28:29.067 --> 01:28:31.067
Six people have been
killed by sharks

1674
01:28:31.067 --> 01:28:33.600
and several more attacked
in the local waters

1675
01:28:33.633 --> 01:28:35.400
since September 2011.

1676
01:28:35.433 --> 01:28:37.267
That's gonna target
large sharks

1677
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.667
including. uh. the vulnerable
great white shark.

1678
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:44.367
and we believe it's 2014
and we're beyond that now.

1679
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.200
[man] Under the plan.
baited drumlines would be
set off local beaches

1680
01:28:48.233 --> 01:28:49.967
to catch great white sharks.

1681
01:28:50.067 --> 01:28:53.067
tiger. and bull sharks
bigger than three meters.

1682
01:28:53.067 --> 01:28:54.733
Protesters claim
killing sharks

1683
01:28:54.767 --> 01:28:57.100
would devastate
the marine ecosystem.

1684
01:28:57.133 --> 01:29:00.833
[woman] The protests grew
from hundreds to thousands.

1685
01:29:00.867 --> 01:29:02.533
It's their water!

1686
01:29:02.567 --> 01:29:04.133
[all] Stop the slaughter!

1687
01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:07.233
Please just change
the policy.

1688
01:29:07.267 --> 01:29:09.600
[woman] Some protesters
went too far

1689
01:29:09.633 --> 01:29:12.967
with death threats
against the premier
and fisheries minister

1690
01:29:13.067 --> 01:29:15.233
and abuse
for contract fishermen.

1691
01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:18.933
But even shark victims
didn't like the drumlines.

1692
01:29:18.967 --> 01:29:19.067
Killing animals
isn't the greatest idea.
