00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.257
Kai?

4
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.433
Kai. is that you son?

5
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.319
Thank you. Thank you.

6
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.546
Welcome home son.
How was school today?

7
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.508
Ah. I see that smile
on your face.

8
00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:10.685
You went up the mountains.

9
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.037
So tell me.
did you see anything wonderful?

10
00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:20.260
Ah. the Great Lady
was surveying her domain.

11
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.393
Ah...

12
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.092
I miss the sound of your...
of your voice my son.

13
00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.225
Don't look sad.

14
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:32.968
Remember. everybody
grieves in their own way.

15
00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:37.277
And losing your father
and your grandfather

16
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.149
is an awful lot
for any heart to carry.

17
00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:46.155
Remember. the doctor said
that you will find your voice.

18
00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:49.898
And when you're ready.
I can't wait to hear it.

19
00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:54.206
But I will admit. I listen
to your voice all the time.

20
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.906
You do sound like
a five-year-old in my mind.

21
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.169
but you know. that's...

22
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.217
I wonder what
your voice sounds like.

23
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:10.048
I'll bet it's rich
and deep like your father's.

24
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.314
I miss him.

25
00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:17.621
Do you remember all of
the hikes that we would take?

26
00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.321
Do you remember when
we would go up the mountains

27
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:23.410
just to get away
from the things of men?

28
00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:25.847
I remember...

29
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.937
your little legs
would be trying so hard

30
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.592
to keep up and you just
couldn't do it.

31
00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:33.811
You would reach your arms up
to us.

32
00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:36.074
We would lift you up
on our shoulders.

33
00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:41.689
I miss those hikes.
all of the adventures.

34
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.127
Do you remember the things
that your father

35
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.433
would talk to us about?

36
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:50.567
All about balance.
all about nature.

37
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.309
We had some really good times.
didn't we?

38
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:56.617
But the one who really...

39
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.315
understood that was
your grandfather. Ronan.

40
00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:04.668
I swear he knew
every tree and rock by name.

41
00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:08.193
And he was on a first-name
basis with all of the animals.

42
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:12.981
Isn't she beautiful?

43
00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:16.811
In your mother's native
language of Gaelic.

44
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:20.292
she is called.

45
00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:25.733
She represents wisdom.
and she helps us

46
00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:33.088
to find those hidden truths
and bring them to light.

47
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.309
In my heritage.
my Viking heritage.

48
00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.442
she is called ugla.

49
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.098
She helps us see
in the spiritual dark.

50
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.355
Hey. all done with homework?

51
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.662
Uh. yeah. I just finished
up the English essay

52
00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:38.534
and now I'm going to finish up
this biology thing.

53
00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:42.669
- Do you need any help or...?
- Nope. Kai helped me.

54
00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:43.974
Okay.
Well. I'm gonna head to bed.

55
00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:45.323
- Don't stay up too late.
- Okay.

56
00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:47.587
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

57
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:13.134
Haley!
Hey. Haley.

58
00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:15.963
See what I did there?

59
00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:17.747
Uh. welcome.
Glad you could make it.

60
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:20.097
Um. vascular plant.
All right.

61
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:22.752
So this date's back
about 420 million years. okay.

62
00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:24.449
So it's been
around for a while.

63
00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:27.061
Um. vascular plants. have...
they have a built in

64
00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:28.976
transportation system.
all right?

65
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.847
So they're really good at...
at. uh. conducting energy

66
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:32.849
and bringing fluid
and transporting nutrients.

67
00:10:33.023 --> 00:10:36.374
They even actually will. uh.
enlist like other organisms.

68
00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:38.507
which sounds really gross.
but... okay.

69
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:40.074
So they're amazingly resourceful.

70
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:46.210
Okay. so...
dermal is like the skin. right?

71
00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:52.869
And vascular is like...
the veins.

72
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:57.395
So ground
is like the fat cells?

73
00:10:58.962 --> 00:11:00.485
Cool.

74
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.531
Who knows what chlorophyll is?

75
00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:05.316
- Plant's food.
- Kind of.

76
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.841
So chlorophyll is. um.

77
00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:09.843
you can buy it at that
health food store.

78
00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:11.758
Like. uh. it's like that green
disgusting drink.

79
00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:13.542
You guys know
what I'm talking about?

80
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.370
Don't know if your parents
ever make you drink it.

81
00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:17.241
Uh. yeah. go ahead.

82
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.378
Hey. guys. I will be in my
office Tuesday. not Wednesday.

83
00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:25.815
Just review
the. uh. study material. okay?

84
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:28.035
I promise it's not that hard. but...

85
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.736
Hey Kai.
can you hold back just one sec?

86
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.956
Are you planning on doing
the science fair?

87
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.785
Yeah? Okay. They got a really
good scholarship opportunity

88
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.657
and I actually
signed this already for you.

89
00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:44.268
So... see you. John. sorry.

90
00:11:44.442 --> 00:11:47.097
Um. um. I hope you'll-
I hope you'll do it.

91
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:48.446
It'd be good for you.

92
00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:52.146
Sorry. Brian. um...

93
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.409
You gonna ask me if
I'm gonna do the science fair?

94
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:57.325
Yeah. absolutely.
Um. but on that note.

95
00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:59.414
like. man. what's going on
with your grades?

96
00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:47.854
Well.
if it isn't Dr. Kai Leigh.

97
00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:51.901
How are you today?

98
00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:55.209
So I wanted to thank you
for your help

99
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:57.472
with that paphiopedilum.

100
00:12:57.646 --> 00:13:01.563
Your suggestion
saved that plant.

101
00:13:02.912 --> 00:13:05.959
So in thanks.
we want to offer you

102
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:09.179
a 50% discount
for the entire year.

103
00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.053
How's your mom doing
by the way?

104
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:16.839
Good then.
I may be up for promotion.

105
00:13:17.492 --> 00:13:20.495
So I'm excited about that.

106
00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:23.411
So please say hi to your mom
for me. We're good here.

107
00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:25.456
It's good to see you again. Kai.

108
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.198
Dr. Leigh.

109
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.959
There's that mute freak.

110
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:36.005
All right.
let's go have a talk.

111
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.704
- You need a walk. boy?
- Hi.

112
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.403
The mute freak.
Probably can't hear me either.

113
00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:44.187
Kai.

114
00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:49.845
Hold up a sec.
So where's the snake?

115
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.499
Didn't it need a walk too?

116
00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:55.068
Man. my mom said you used
to be able to talk.

117
00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:57.287
Ah. seem a little
broken though. huh?

118
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.855
Losing your dad
and grandpa do that to you?

119
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.250
Man. that must have
done a number on you boy.

120
00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:05.382
Hi. defective.

121
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:08.385
Maybe your daddy was a snake.

122
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:13.303
Come on boys.
Let's go.

123
00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:17.525
<i>Life is not easy.</i>

124
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:23.313
<i>We must all work hard
to support one another</i>

125
00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:26.316
<i>and support our world.</i>

126
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:32.757
<i>That is life
and life is connection.</i>

127
00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.326
<i>Life is a circle.</i>

128
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.592
<i>From dust we come
and to dust we will go.</i>

129
00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:15.757
So Kai. how was your day today?

130
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:20.240
You didn't go to
the mountains. did you?

131
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:24.418
Of course. I can tell.

132
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:26.942
You seem off.

133
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:30.119
Is everything okay?

134
00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:35.168
Sorry. Sorry.
I'll back off.

135
00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:43.698
You know. Kai.
I heard a story once

136
00:16:43.872 --> 00:16:47.745
about a carrot.
an egg. and a tea leaf.

137
00:16:50.357 --> 00:16:53.316
Well. they were each
gathered by the farmer

138
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.581
and each of them saw
the farmer set the fire.

139
00:16:57.755 --> 00:17:02.325
put the pot on the fire.
and put the water in the pot.

140
00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:05.981
As they watched
that water begin to boil.

141
00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:07.678
the carrot was unafraid.

142
00:17:07.852 --> 00:17:10.986
Fruit was strong
and it knew that its strength

143
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.336
would protect it
from this challenge.

144
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.513
The egg knew that it was
soft and tender inside.

145
00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:20.474
but it counted on its shell to
protect it from the challenge.

146
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:25.131
The tea leaf.
the tea leaf was flexible

147
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:28.308
and it knew it would
face this challenge.

148
00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:31.050
And into the water
went all of them.

149
00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:37.404
What do you think happened when
they came out of that water?

150
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:40.755
Did the carrot's
strength protect it?

151
00:17:42.844 --> 00:17:44.454
That carrot came out

152
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.804
and all of its strength
had been sapped out of it

153
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:50.156
from that challenge.
And it was weak and mushy.

154
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.636
What about the egg?

155
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.900
When that egg was opened up.
that once soft interior

156
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.033
was now hardened
by that challenge.

157
00:17:58.947 --> 00:18:00.383
But what about that tea leaf?

158
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:02.951
What happened with it?

159
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:07.521
The tea leaf did something
completely unique.

160
00:18:07.695 --> 00:18:11.394
It changed the water
and it turned it into tea.

161
00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:14.876
I don't know what challenges
you're facing right now.

162
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.053
but you have to decide
what are you.

163
00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:21.274
Are you a carrot that's
going to trust your strength

164
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:24.712
and then be weakened
by the challenge?

165
00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:29.020
Are you gonna be the egg
and have your tender heart

166
00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:32.023
absolutely hardened by it?

167
00:18:33.286 --> 00:18:37.072
Or are you gonna be the tea
leaf and change the world?

168
00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:45.820
<i>You are acting as</i>

169
00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:47.909
<i>the sacred fire
keeper tonight.</i>

170
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:51.652
<i>So you are responsible for
this space and for the fire.</i>

171
00:18:54.176 --> 00:18:57.919
<i>Kai. the native people of
this land and your ancestors</i>

172
00:18:58.093 --> 00:19:02.053
<i>have great wisdom in their
love and respect for nature.</i>

173
00:19:02.663 --> 00:19:06.710
<i>And we are wise if we learn
from them and listen.</i>

174
00:19:09.757 --> 00:19:15.066
<i>I miss your father too.
I feel all those same things.</i>

175
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:18.679
<i>And it is okay to feel
the things you feel.</i>

176
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.595
<i>It is okay to cry.</i>

177
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:24.424
<i>Your mind
and heart are so heavy.</i>

178
00:19:25.686 --> 00:19:30.125
<i>Let them rest.
breathe in the air and let go.</i>

179
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:32.649
<i>Feel the earth beneath you.</i>

180
00:19:32.823 --> 00:19:36.175
<i>Listen closely and hear
nature's voice singing.</i>

181
00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:40.657
<i>In many cultures around
the world people use dance</i>

182
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:44.183
<i>to express feelings
that are too deep for words.</i>

183
00:19:44.357 --> 00:19:47.229
<i>Dance lets us
connect to ourselves</i>

184
00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:49.927
<i>and the earth in special ways.</i>

185
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:52.495
<i>It doesn't change the world.</i>

186
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:55.194
<i>but it lets us
clear our hearts.</i>

187
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.559
Yeah. your worthless kid.

188
00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.300
- My kid.
- Your. your worthless kid.

189
00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:00.259
- My worthless.
- He can't even mow this lawn.

190
00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:02.652
If you want him to grow up
an emotional cripple.

191
00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.480
go ahead and keep
coddling him then.

192
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:07.266
I am not coddling him.

193
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.964
He'll- he'll be fine.
He'll get his grades up.

194
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:12.183
Of course. yeah.
You say this every year.

195
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:14.838
Every year. He should
just quit and get a job.

196
00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:16.971
At least then he'd be
doing something useful.

197
00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:19.582
No. No. This is the year
he will find his path.

198
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:21.541
- I know he will.
- Yeah.

199
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.934
- This... Is hard for me.
- Really.

200
00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:25.719
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:28.112
You know. you're always
make excuses for him.

202
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.158
He's just a kid.
He has challenges.

203
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:31.812
He's just learning.

204
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.815
- I'm supposed to be his dad.
- Yeah.

205
00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:36.947
So yeah. So I should
have some say in this too.

206
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:38.688
- You should.
- Yeah.

207
00:21:38.862 --> 00:21:40.342
And... But you don't act
like a dad.

208
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:42.213
When have you ever
listened to him?

209
00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:44.825
- When have you ever?
- I try. I... I try.

210
00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:47.610
- I try.
- No. you've not.

211
00:21:47.784 --> 00:21:49.569
He treats me worse
than he treats you.

212
00:21:49.743 --> 00:21:51.484
He shows me no respect at all.

213
00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:53.703
If I'd treated my dad that way
he would have kicked out.

214
00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:55.314
- Your dad.
- Yeah. my dad.

215
00:21:55.488 --> 00:21:57.272
Great. Yeah.
let's talk about your dad.

216
00:21:57.446 --> 00:22:00.797
No. you have never once done
anything to earn his respect.

217
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:03.147
Why should he respect you?

218
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:08.327
Hey. I want my dinner
ready when I get back. okay?

219
00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:32.089
This is hot garbage.
It's so sad.

220
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:31.382
All right guys.
So yesterday

221
00:24:31.557 --> 00:24:33.080
we were talking
about cell structure.

222
00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:35.125
Now. I know you all found
that incredibly exciting.

223
00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:37.824
Um. but today we're
gonna be moving into DNA.

224
00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:42.263
Okay. Um. who knows
what DNA stands for?

225
00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:45.048
Go ahead.

226
00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:46.659
Um. deoxyribonucleic acid.

227
00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:48.878
Deoxyribonucleic acid. Yeah.

228
00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:50.837
So. uh. we're actually
gonna be extracting

229
00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:52.621
DNA from a strawberry.

230
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:54.275
Um. we're not cloning
to dinosaurs. I'm sorry.

231
00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:56.407
It's not as...
not that exciting.

232
00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:59.106
but um. you're gonna be doing
the same extraction

233
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.151
process that they do
in labs and everything.

234
00:25:01.717 --> 00:25:04.459
How this works is we take
what's called saline solution

235
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:06.983
and this is just
soap and saltwater.

236
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:08.898
And what it actually does
is it's gonna break down

237
00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:11.248
the cell wall and once
that's broken down.

238
00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:13.729
you can actually go in
and extract the DNA. Okay.

239
00:25:13.903 --> 00:25:16.471
Um. the salt
is kind of important.

240
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:19.082
This is on the quiz too.
So write this down. whatever.

241
00:25:19.256 --> 00:25:23.347
Um. it will actually
pull out the. uh. the-

242
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:25.828
Or provides. I'm sorry.

243
00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:28.004
Provides a positive
light. okay.

244
00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:31.791
And that allows them to
pull out the negative DNA

245
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:35.011
out of the solution once
you've completed this.

246
00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:36.665
So. uh. you all have
your instructions.

247
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:38.972
It's all pretty straightforward.

248
00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:40.539
But if you have questions.
please ask.

249
00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:42.541
Okay?

250
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:24.817
Oh. Kai.

251
00:27:25.252 --> 00:27:28.211
Thank you for dinner.
Sit down. sit down.

252
00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:30.649
How was your day?

253
00:27:34.391 --> 00:27:35.784
Everything all right?

254
00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:40.876
Kai. what's going on?

255
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:46.012
Hey. listen.

256
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.188
There's gonna be a really
cool show on later.

257
00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:49.668
Do you wanna watch it with me?

258
00:27:49.842 --> 00:27:51.582
It's about plants
in the Amazon.

259
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.718
Kai. I'm worried about you.

260
00:28:02.202 --> 00:28:03.812
Oh. Kai.

261
00:28:08.208 --> 00:28:11.559
Kai. I love you.

262
00:28:18.087 --> 00:28:21.656
Okay. So I think I finally
understand. do you think

263
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.267
they're gonna make us like
dissect a frog or something?

264
00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:26.226
God. how cool would that be?

265
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.663
I mean. what do you think
the inside of it looks like?

266
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:30.665
Maybe we could look...
look at its brains.

267
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.754
Do you think it looks
like a human brain.

268
00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:34.451
all the ridges and everything?

269
00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:36.366
Because I think it would
be quite similar

270
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.455
because I heard that
frogs are really intelligent.

271
00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:40.806
- So I was thinking...
- Kai. let's have a talk.

272
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:43.852
Don't you know
you're just petty case.

273
00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:45.724
just a project for her?

274
00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:47.551
What do you see in
this freak. Aspen?

275
00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:50.293
You know.
he's a real retard. right?

276
00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:51.512
Just don't listen to them.

277
00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:53.209
Oh hell. um.

278
00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:55.429
Let's go. Smily. Both of you.

279
00:28:55.603 --> 00:28:57.648
That's twice this week.
Let's go.

280
00:28:57.823 --> 00:28:59.999
Both of you now. Office.

281
00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:01.652
Kai. you watch your back.

282
00:29:06.657 --> 00:29:09.617
Kai! Kai!

283
00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:34.849
Yeah. no. honestly. I'm just
a little worried about him.

284
00:31:35.023 --> 00:31:37.025
He seems kind of withdrawn

285
00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:41.464
and his grades just are-
they're not good.

286
00:31:41.638 --> 00:31:44.946
Um. he was actually
supposed to come meet with-

287
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.905
you know what.
he actually just walked in.

288
00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:49.081
Okay. Yep.

289
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:51.039
I- I'll let him know. Bye.

290
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.302
Hey. Kai.

291
00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:55.087
Mom wants to talk.
How are you doing?

292
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.974
No. Hey. man I wasn't
trying to bother her.

293
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:15.281
We were just... Look I'm...

294
00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:18.893
I'm just concerned about you.
I'll just say it.

295
00:32:19.067 --> 00:32:22.592
Um. you know. the work
you're doing it's...

296
00:32:22.766 --> 00:32:24.464
it's not your best.

297
00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:26.509
And...

298
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.088
Okay. That... that's fine.

299
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:45.224
Um. at the end of the day.
you still have to do the work

300
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.791
just like everyone else.
you know?

301
00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:52.274
Are you... Look. are you sure
there's nothing else going on?

302
00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:54.929
You can tell me.

303
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:08.725
Kai. Kai. come on.

304
00:33:59.254 --> 00:34:03.084
What's up?

305
00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:07.436
It seems there's been
an allegation against you.

306
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.788
And because of the seriousness
of the allegation.

307
00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:14.269
I'm afraid I needed
to contact the union.

308
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:16.358
So you're going to have
a representative

309
00:34:16.532 --> 00:34:18.708
and a lawyer come here
and I need to know

310
00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:20.319
if you wanna
come speak with...

311
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:22.060
What allegation?

312
00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:23.844
I'm so sorry.
We'll discuss it all

313
00:34:24.018 --> 00:34:25.367
in the principal's office.

314
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:27.195
but you need to come
with me right now.

315
00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:29.371
Somebody will come in
and take care of your class.

316
00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:30.894
Okay. You just...

317
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.548
Let's sit down there.
I'm so sorry.

318
00:35:25.558 --> 00:35:29.692
Dr. Leigh. we haven't
seen you for a while.

319
00:35:29.866 --> 00:35:31.607
How have you been?

320
00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:37.178
Hey. how's your...
how's your mom?

321
00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:45.752
Uh. uh. okay.

322
00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:47.623
I'll ring you up.

323
00:35:50.626 --> 00:35:54.456
So I was wondering
if I could get your help

324
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.807
with one of our middle
Middlemist rose. red roses?

325
00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:03.117
I... It's just that you're-
it's just you're so good at it.

326
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:12.648
Um. is there anything
I can do for you. Kai?

327
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.913
Hey. Kai hold up.

328
00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:20.917
Look. I'm... I'm sorry
I... I'm concerned about you.

329
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:24.965
I... I... It's just really
you haven't been yours...

330
00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:12.491
Bills. bills. bills.

331
00:37:17.452 --> 00:37:18.888
It's okay.

332
00:37:19.628 --> 00:37:23.719
I can just get a third
or maybe even a fourth job.

333
00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:27.506
Hell. I could just
work all the time.

334
00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:35.949
That boy. if he isn't gonna
graduate. he should work too.

335
00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.865
Someone's gotta pay
the bills around here.

336
00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:44.305
Knock it off. Al.
I don't know why it happened.

337
00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:48.744
I don't know what happened.
It just happened.

338
00:37:50.224 --> 00:37:52.879
Just it doesn't help
to get mad about it.

339
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:58.667
Do not tell me
how to feel in my own home.

340
00:37:59.668 --> 00:38:01.757
I can't work
any harder than I do.

341
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.107
It's the government's fault.

342
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:08.024
No. Would you please
stop blaming them?

343
00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:10.766
Everyone thinks you're
crazy when you say that.

344
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.987
- Don't call me crazy.
- Mm.

345
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:20.689
So. so no.
I'm just on probation

346
00:38:20.863 --> 00:38:22.517
until the end of the year.

347
00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:25.520
And it... it all came from
that one anonymous review.

348
00:38:25.694 --> 00:38:27.435
but I don't know.

349
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:29.045
The... the school's
just doing it

350
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:30.786
to cover themselves
and the district.

351
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.440
I mean. of course.
they are. right?

352
00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:36.226
But I don't know.

353
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:38.403
I feel like a criminal.
I didn't do anything wrong.

354
00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:40.230
Wait. how can they do that?

355
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:43.930
It's based on rumor
and hearsay. It's just crazy.

356
00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:46.846
I mean. I know that you give
everything to those students.

357
00:38:48.456 --> 00:38:51.154
Do you know
who could've done it?

358
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:56.334
No. I have no idea.

359
00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:10.451
Come in. I'm okay.

360
00:40:10.625 --> 00:40:14.063
I'm okay.

361
00:44:01.247 --> 00:44:03.945
<i>Listen to your ancestors. Kai.</i>

362
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.430
<i>They live within you.</i>

363
00:44:10.604 --> 00:44:13.607
<i>The souls of Shaman</i>

364
00:44:17.567 --> 00:44:20.875
<i>from thousands of generations
whisper to you.</i>

365
00:44:23.965 --> 00:44:28.535
<i>Let them guide you
claim your right.</i>

366
00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:08.330
Kai! Oh. Kai. Kai.

367
00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:11.246
Kai. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

368
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.076
I know you found my papers.
I'm trying to fix it.

369
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:19.298
I'll fix it I promise.
I was so scared.

370
00:46:19.472 --> 00:46:22.040
I thought I lost you forever.

371
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:24.999
I thought you've run away.

372
00:46:28.524 --> 00:46:32.311
Kai. I know things
are hard right now.

373
00:46:32.485 --> 00:46:34.661
And I can't fix them
the way I want to.

374
00:46:34.835 --> 00:46:38.621
And I can't promise
that it'll be better soon.

375
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:41.059
but it will get better.

376
00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:43.061
Kai. darling. Please live.

377
00:46:43.235 --> 00:46:46.194
Please let me help you
get the help you need.

378
00:46:46.368 --> 00:46:49.458
Okay?
Oh. just hold my hands. son.

379
00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:53.506
- Please just hold my hands.
- Mama.

380
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.467
Oh. Kai. Kai.
You just made a s...

381
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:02.820
- Did you just speak?
- I love you. mama.

382
00:47:02.994 --> 00:47:05.344
Oh. Kai.

383
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:20.750
<i>You found your voice.</i>

384
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:23.231
<i>What will you do with it?</i>

385
00:47:47.734 --> 00:47:50.302
Yeah. we won!

386
00:47:51.825 --> 00:47:54.088
All right. man.
Good job. buddy.

387
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:58.397
Yeah. All right. Whoa!

388
00:48:14.587 --> 00:48:16.067
Hey. freak.

389
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:17.851
Did you put any of
these on my locker?

390
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:24.858
Freak. you put this
on my locker?

391
00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:28.688
- Yeah.
- Talking now.

392
00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:43.398
Hey. freak...

393
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:48.229
Kai...

394
00:48:53.582 --> 00:48:55.367
why?

395
00:48:56.368 --> 00:48:57.847
Because it's true.

396
00:49:09.294 --> 00:49:11.426
Um...

397
00:49:15.126 --> 00:49:17.955
Uh. it's actually really cool.

398
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:22.089
Uh. could I help with that?

399
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.833
Thanks.

400
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:38.062
Hey. what's yours say?

401
00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:40.020
- Um. says you are bright.
- Nice. And you?

402
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:43.110
- Mine says you are ready.
- What's your say?

403
00:49:43.284 --> 00:49:46.722
I'm. uh.
I'm worth fighting for.

404
00:49:46.896 --> 00:49:50.465
- That's cool.
- Um. here. For you.

405
00:49:51.945 --> 00:49:53.773
Y'all have a good day.

406
00:49:57.646 --> 00:49:59.170
Hey. Mr. Dewitt.

407
00:49:59.344 --> 00:50:00.823
Hey Bryan. What's up?

408
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.390
I didn't call for you. did I?

409
00:50:02.564 --> 00:50:04.653
- No. this was my idea.
- Oh. yeah.

410
00:50:04.827 --> 00:50:06.742
I was gonna say.
'cause I don't...

411
00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:10.050
There's no... there's no report
for you so Ms. Anderson.

412
00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:13.140
- didn't kick you out again.
- No. this... this is my idea.

413
00:50:13.314 --> 00:50:14.794
Are you saving
the school officer

414
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:16.709
sometime today or what's up?
What's going on?

415
00:50:16.883 --> 00:50:21.105
It's shocking but last time
I was in here

416
00:50:21.279 --> 00:50:25.370
you said that there was still
a chance I could graduate.

417
00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:28.590
- Really?
- I mean it. yeah.

418
00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:30.549
Yes.

419
00:50:30.723 --> 00:50:32.638
You're pretty far off track
for graduation though.

420
00:50:32.812 --> 00:50:34.640
Okay.

421
00:50:34.814 --> 00:50:36.729
Now. Bryan. I'm gonna tell you
it's not gonna be easy.

422
00:50:37.947 --> 00:50:41.734
Uh. now it's gonna take a lot
of hard work and no joke.

423
00:50:41.908 --> 00:50:44.171
commitment from you.

424
00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:47.348
- Gimme those.
- Sorry. Mr. Dewitt.

425
00:50:48.697 --> 00:50:51.265
I've seen a lot of students
in your situation

426
00:50:51.439 --> 00:50:52.701
and they quit
because they can't meet

427
00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:54.486
all the requirements.

428
00:50:55.748 --> 00:50:59.447
My... my mom and my dad.

429
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:01.710
they didn't graduate
high school.

430
00:51:01.884 --> 00:51:04.061
They haven't gone to college.

431
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:08.413
Quitting is no longer
an option. I wanna walk.

432
00:51:08.587 --> 00:51:10.806
Good.
Let's work on this pack. okay?

433
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.243
Okay.

434
00:51:13.679 --> 00:51:15.333
So first I'm gonna
need you to get

435
00:51:15.507 --> 00:51:17.248
your teachers
to sign these letters.

436
00:51:17.422 --> 00:51:18.727
I'm gonna print 'em out
for you.

437
00:51:18.901 --> 00:51:19.946
- Okay?
- Okay.

438
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.039
Now what?

439
00:52:17.395 --> 00:52:19.266
You are loved.

440
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.748
Hmm.

441
00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:40.244
All right.

442
00:52:40.853 --> 00:52:42.942
You're way too old
to be like that.

443
00:52:43.116 --> 00:52:46.206
No. if I say no.
the answer is no.

444
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.427
Go get in the car.
No. leave your shoes on.

445
00:52:54.258 --> 00:52:57.043
Today not worse.

446
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:06.183
Are you kidding?

447
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.298
Kids. can we start over?

448
00:53:35.908 --> 00:53:37.779
Let's go home.

449
00:55:21.448 --> 00:55:23.145
Hey. um...

450
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:28.847
I don't...
There's really nothing

451
00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:32.894
I can say but these flowers
aren't nearly

452
00:55:33.068 --> 00:55:34.722
as beautiful as you are.

453
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.772
- Thank you. honey.
- Yeah.

454
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:44.210
Work on some of these
bills together

455
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:48.954
before they come
and get everything.

456
00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:55.395
Oh. and you know.

457
00:55:58.485 --> 00:56:01.793
Bryan. he really is a good kid.

458
00:56:02.924 --> 00:56:04.883
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna do better.

459
00:56:05.057 --> 00:56:09.801
I. uh. I'm gonna try
a little harder.

460
00:56:09.975 --> 00:56:11.324
Both of you.

461
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:14.153
I got a lot of stuff that are...

462
00:56:14.327 --> 00:56:16.547
I gotta work on myself.

463
00:56:16.721 --> 00:56:19.637
And none of its either
of you guys' faults.

464
00:56:23.554 --> 00:56:26.557
- I love you.
- I love you too.

465
00:56:37.872 --> 00:56:40.005
If this has a nucleus.

466
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:42.007
then what type of cell
is it not?

467
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:45.402
Uh. that is not nucleus?

468
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:50.232
These are
the ones that do have them.

469
00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:52.147
So like bacteria.
for example. right?

470
00:56:52.321 --> 00:56:55.499
Always think about that.
So a cell in your body. right?

471
00:56:55.673 --> 00:56:57.544
They're all gonna have
the nucleus whereas

472
00:56:57.718 --> 00:56:59.416
like something like
bacteria is not. right?

473
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:01.287
So something...

474
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:04.421
All cells photosynthesize. right?

475
00:57:04.595 --> 00:57:07.336
We... Yeah. But that's
kind of the different...

476
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:09.251
that's... that's going back to
the lesson we talking before.

477
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:11.819
this is more focused
on what's gonna be coming up.

478
00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:20.437
Is this even worth
it at this point?

479
00:57:20.611 --> 00:57:22.177
No. here... Okay.
Now you're making me feel bad.

480
00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:23.918
It's kind of a trick question.
You were right.

481
00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:26.312
Look. viruses contain DNA.
but not much else.

482
00:57:27.705 --> 00:57:29.533
So you not remembering
is actually a good thing.

483
00:57:29.707 --> 00:57:32.318
- Oh. okay!
- Let's put that one right!

484
00:57:32.492 --> 00:57:35.495
See it does.
No. you're fine though.

485
00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:37.802
But seriously. that...
that was the question.

486
00:57:46.854 --> 00:57:49.596
Wendy is the best
employee I've ever seen.

487
00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:53.034
She deserves a bonus
and a promotion.

488
00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.820
She encourages me
to learn about plants

489
00:57:55.994 --> 00:57:58.170
and challenges me
to bring them back to life.

490
00:57:58.736 --> 00:58:00.259
Congratulations. Sunny.

491
00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:01.652
Looks like you guys

492
00:58:01.826 --> 00:58:03.088
are having a good time
over here.

493
00:58:03.262 --> 00:58:05.220
- How was everything?
- Great.

494
00:58:05.394 --> 00:58:07.962
How about some dessert. huh?
Keep those smiles going.

495
00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:11.052
We have a beautiful
peanut butter cheesecake

496
00:58:11.226 --> 00:58:12.489
and our chef did an absolutely

497
00:58:12.663 --> 00:58:14.708
amazing tiramisu this evening.

498
00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.710
- What do you think?
- Let's do both of them.

499
00:58:16.884 --> 00:58:18.538
- Both?
- Yeah.

500
00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:21.019
You know. what.
tonight it's on the house.

501
00:58:21.193 --> 00:58:23.412
- Hey. thanks.
- Yeah. of course.

502
00:58:23.587 --> 00:58:26.154
Well. you guys.
I love you so much.

503
00:58:26.328 --> 00:58:28.069
Love you.

504
00:58:28.243 --> 00:58:31.116
So I just... all I have to do
is get my GED.

505
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.380
and then I can get
some more promotions.

506
00:58:34.554 --> 00:58:37.905
And then I can... They said
they might help with college.

507
00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:39.341
I might get some help.

508
01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.700
Hey. Aspen.

509
01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:21.922
Look. I'm so sorry.

510
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.018
Everyone looks so chipper. please.

511
01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.499
My goodness.

512
01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:38.765
Sorry. Mr. B.

513
01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.944
My gift to you.

514
01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:45.729
Hope it's a gift.

515
01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.478
Three. two. one...

516
01:00:58.524 --> 01:00:59.612
What? No way.

517
01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:01.875
Yeah. let's go.

518
01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:04.008
I mean. it's not all of it.

519
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.967
It's far from all of it.
but that's a C.

520
01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:09.361
That's a C.
See you Mr. B.

521
01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:10.971
I gotta go.

522
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:39.739
Hello. Dr. Petin.
This is Rebekah Leigh.

523
01:01:39.913 --> 01:01:42.394
I've just decided I'm not
quite ready to give up.

524
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.791
Next week.
I'll see you then.

525
01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:00.891
Getting into
multicellular organisms.

526
01:02:01.065 --> 01:02:02.806
These are all developed
from single cell.

527
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.286
Okay. This is very common in
all kind of cellular reactions.

528
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.332
It comes from.
uh... It's called a zygote.

529
01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:09.638
This comes from the Greek
word yolk and...

530
01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:11.336
and it's called a zygote.

531
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.120
Hey Mrs. Shelley. what's up?

532
01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.383
I'm sorry for the interruption.
Mr. Browning

533
01:02:15.557 --> 01:02:17.124
but I wanted to come
share the news

534
01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:19.474
with you and celebrate
with your students.

535
01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:22.390
- Congratulations.

537
