My name's David Byrne.

42
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.214
Thank you.

43
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:32.464
I can't take any credit for that.

44
00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:34.881
I had no choice in the matter.

45
00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:37.631
I read something.
well. kinda surprising

46
00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:38.964
and amazing the other day.

47
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.756
I read that babies' brains

48
00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:46.339
have hundreds of millions
more neural connections

49
00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:48.047
than we do as adults.

50
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.673
and that as we grow up.

51
00:05:49.756 --> 00:05:52.339
we lose these connections.

52
00:05:52.422 --> 00:05:55.714
So I wondered to myself.
what does this mean?

53
00:05:57.297 --> 00:06:00.464
Does this mean that babies
are smarter than we are

54
00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.214
and that as we grow up.

55
00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:05.547
we get stupider and stupider

56
00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.589
until we reach a...

57
00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:11.089
a plateau of stupidity?

58
00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:13.881
Which is where most of us are now.

59
00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:14.964
Well...

60
00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:16.547
♪ ♪

61
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:18.714
What happens is...

62
00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:21.673
we keep the connections
that are useful to us.

63
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:25.381
and. yes. there's a process
of pruning and elimination.

64
00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:28.214
and we get rid of a lot of the others

65
00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:30.464
until the ones that are left

66
00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:33.756
define who we are as a person.

67
00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.214
who we are as people.

68
00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:38.923
They define how we perceive the world.

69
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:40.255
and the world appears

70
00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.547
to make some kinda sense to us.

71
00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:44.798
And maybe round about that time

72
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:46.881
we start asking ourselves
various questions

73
00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:49.297
like. "Who am I?

74
00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:50.589
"What do I want?

75
00:06:50.673 --> 00:06:52.589
"How do I work this?

76
00:06:52.673 --> 00:06:54.714
"What are those people
doing over there?

77
00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:56.589
"Should I be doing that?

78
00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:58.506
"Are they looking at me?

79
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.047
"Are they like me?

80
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.631
"Should I go over and talk to them?

81
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.506
Huh. maybe not."

82
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.589
Try to figure this out.

83
00:07:08.673 --> 00:07:09.756
wondering if there's.

84
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.589
you know. wondering if
there's a logic to it

85
00:07:11.673 --> 00:07:14.464
and wondering if it's supposed
to make some kinda sense.

There's more.

290
00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:46.798
My friend Brian Eno
suggested that we use

291
00:21:46.881 --> 00:21:50.130
a nonsense poem by a Dada artist

292
00:21:50.214 --> 00:21:52.255
as the lyrics for this next song.

293
00:21:52.756 --> 00:21:54.297
which we did.

294
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:57.547
I was familiar with
a different Dada artist

295
00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:00.130
who also wrote nonsense poetry.

296
00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:01.964
His name was Kurt Schwitters.

297
00:22:02.047 --> 00:22:05.297
and he recorded one of these in 1932.

298
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:07.798
It was called the "Ursonate."

299
00:22:07.881 --> 00:22:10.130
the primeval sonate.

300
00:22:10.214 --> 00:22:11.798
Schwitters and some
of the others in the...

301
00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:14.172
this group were. well...

302
00:22:14.255 --> 00:22:16.506
they were using nonsense to make sense

303
00:22:16.589 --> 00:22:19.172
of a world that didn't make sense.

304
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:23.464
To help explain a little bit
what that means.

305
00:22:23.547 --> 00:22:26.089
here's a little bit
of the "Ursonate."

306
00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:50.756
It goes on like that for 40 minutes.

307
00:22:54.923 --> 00:22:57.381
It'd be a different kinda movie.

308
00:22:58.464 --> 00:23:00.339
The world they were trying
to make sense of. it...

309
00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:02.005
Yes. it was pretty crazy.

310
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.714
Uh. there had recently
been an economic crash.

311
00:23:04.798 --> 00:23:06.881
Uh. the Nazis were coming to power.

312
00:23:06.964 --> 00:23:08.673
This is 1932.

313
00:23:08.756 --> 00:23:10.756
and quite a few of
the countries they lived in

314
00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:13.464
were sliding into fascism.

315
00:23:13.547 --> 00:23:17.589
The Dada artist Hugo Ball
said that their artistic aims

316
00:23:17.673 --> 00:23:20.047
were to remind the world

317
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.172
that there are people
of different. independent minds

318
00:23:24.255 --> 00:23:27.089
beyond war and nationalism

319
00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.381

Thank you.

425
00:31:36.964 --> 00:31:40.673
In 1976. the band I was in.
Talking Heads. got...

426
00:31:40.756 --> 00:31:42.297
we got a record contract.

427
00:31:43.673 --> 00:31:44.798
Okay...

428
00:31:46.047 --> 00:31:49.756
Thank you. It was a contract
but not for very much money.

429
00:31:51.297 --> 00:31:52.381
I spent some of my money

430
00:31:52.464 --> 00:31:55.005
on a Sony Trinitron color television.

431
00:31:55.964 --> 00:31:58.881
The screen was about that big.

432
00:31:58.964 --> 00:32:02.089
but it was. it was
state-of-the-art in those days.

433
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:04.422
I must have still been a little bit.

434
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.839
a little bit isolated.

435
00:32:05.923 --> 00:32:08.130
still trying to figure things out.

436
00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:10.881
and I had an idea
that to help with that.

437
00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:12.881
I should watch more TV.

438
00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:19.673
Okay. I saw the TV
as being a kind of window.

439
00:32:19.756 --> 00:32:21.881
and I would see the hopes and dreams

440
00:32:21.964 --> 00:32:26.422
and aspirations and foibles
of my fellow Americans.

441
00:32:26.506 --> 00:32:29.297
and I might learn something
about myself as well.

442
00:32:29.923 --> 00:32:31.547
and maybe.

443
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:34.464
maybe I'd get some answers
to those questions

444
00:32:34.547 --> 00:32:36.673
that I was asking myself earlier.

445
00:32:37.923 --> 00:32:39.673
And I wondered to myself.

446
00:32:41.214 --> 00:32:45.714
did the TV contain those
millions of lost connections

447
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:51.631

About a year ago.

495
00:36:20.005 --> 00:36:22.547
I invited a high school choir
in Detroit. Michigan.

496
00:36:22.631 --> 00:36:25.839
to do an interpretation
of this next song.

497
00:36:25.923 --> 00:36:28.172
The song's called
"Everybody's Coming to My House."

498
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:31.130
Thank you.

499
00:36:31.214 --> 00:36:33.089
And in my version.

500
00:36:33.172 --> 00:36:34.839
and that's the version
you're gonna hear...

501
00:36:36.297 --> 00:36:39.255
It... It kinda sounds like

502
00:36:40.172 --> 00:36:41.923
the singer is not sure how he feels

503
00:36:42.005 --> 00:36:45.339
about everybody
coming over to his house.

504
00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:47.798
And you can sense. although
he never says it in the song.

505
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:50.172
you can sense that he's thinking.

506
00:36:50.255 --> 00:36:51.506
"When are they gonna leave?"

507
00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:56.964
In contrast. their version...

508
00:36:57.047 --> 00:37:01.047
And this was kind of
a profound thing for me.

509
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.756
They didn't change a single lyric.

510
00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:04.756
They didn't change the melody.

511
00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:08.589
and yet their version has
a completely different meaning.

512
00:37:08.673 --> 00:37:11.255
Their version seems to be
about welcome.

513
00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:14.547
inviting everyone over. inclusion.

514
00:37:14.631 --> 00:37:17.130
I kinda liked their version better.

515
00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:18.964
and I didn't know how they did it.

516
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:23.005
Unfortunately. I am what I am.

517
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:33.214

In 2016. just before the election.

699
00:50:45.422 --> 00:50:47.589
I went to Charlotte. North Carolina.

700
00:50:47.673 --> 00:50:51.547
to encourage people to register
if they weren't registered.

701
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:54.214
to encourage them to vote
if they were registered.

702
00:50:54.297 --> 00:50:56.881
- The election was in a couple of days.

703
00:50:56.964 --> 00:50:58.422
We do something similar here.

704
00:50:58.506 --> 00:51:01.172

organization called HeadCount.

705
00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:03.047
They have a table in the lobby.

706
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.547
They'll register you instantly.

707
00:51:05.631 --> 00:51:07.923
instantly. no matter
what state you're from.

708
00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:12.130
We also did a thing called a pledge.

709
00:51:12.214 --> 00:51:13.547
The pledge consists of a clipboard

710
00:51:13.631 --> 00:51:14.964
and a piece of paper.

711
00:51:15.047 --> 00:51:16.881
and I would go up to people and go.

712
00:51:16.964 --> 00:51:18.506

saying that you're
gonna vote tomorrow?"

715
00:51:21.631 --> 00:51:23.255
This is not a legal document.

716
00:51:23.339 --> 00:51:25.923
It was just a piece of paper.

717
00:51:26.005 --> 00:51:28.339
but it's been shown that

718
00:51:28.422 --> 00:51:29.923
when people put their name down.

719
00:51:30.005 --> 00:51:32.881
it was like they'd made
a promise to themselves.

720
00:51:33.005 --> 00:51:34.714
and it increased the odds

721
00:51:34.798 --> 00:51:37.255
that they would actually turn up.

722
00:51:37.339 --> 00:51:39.214
The turnout for that election

723
00:51:39.297 --> 00:51:41.255
was the best it had been in decades.

724
00:51:44.381 --> 00:51:46.756
Fifty-five percent of us
turned out to vote.

725
00:51:49.255 --> 00:51:50.881
Okay.

726
00:51:50.964 --> 00:51:52.547
Local elections are another matter.

727
00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:57.339
Local elections.
the average turnout is 20%.

728
00:51:57.422 --> 00:52:01.130
To give you a visual idea
of what 20% looks like.

729
00:52:01.214 --> 00:52:03.964
here are 20%
of the people in this theater.

730
00:52:04.714 --> 00:52:06.130

731
00:52:06.214 --> 00:52:10.005
These are the ones
that vote in local elections.

732
00:52:10.089 --> 00:52:11.923

733
00:52:12.005 --> 00:52:14.172
because. well. they just
decided your future

734
00:52:14.255 --> 00:52:15.964
and the future of your children.

735
00:52:16.047 --> 00:52:18.130
But you guys seem to be okay with that.

736
00:52:19.964 --> 00:52:22.255
Here's another
little bit of information.

737
00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.839
The average age of
the people who turn out

738
00:52:24.923 --> 00:52:26.547
to vote in local elections.

739
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:29.756
that 20%. is 57 years of age.

740
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:32.381
- Whoo!
- Oh!

741
00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.255
There we go.

742
00:52:36.047 --> 00:52:37.547

743
00:52:40.464 --> 00:52:41.506
Congratulations.

744
00:52:43.339 --> 00:52:45.547
Okay. yeah. but 57?

745
00:52:46.422 --> 00:52:48.005
Climate change. right?

746
00:52:48.089 --> 00:52:49.297

you're fucked.

748
00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:54.964
We gotta do better than 20%. really.

749
00:52:58.422 --> 00:53:01.172
Local elections do make a difference.

750
00:53:01.255 --> 00:53:03.631
We gotta do better than 55% too.

Thank you.

829
00:56:48.756 --> 00:56:53.005
In 2018. we toured
a concert version of this show.

830
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:54.422
and we played a lot of places.

831
00:56:54.506 --> 00:56:56.881
We played San Antonio twice.

832
00:56:56.964 --> 00:56:59.089
So a friend of mine came to the show.

833
00:56:59.172 --> 00:57:00.255
and we were talking backstage.

834
00:57:00.339 --> 00:57:01.923
and he asked me.

835
00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:04.464
"Are you really playing
all that music that we hear.

836
00:57:04.547 --> 00:57:07.714
"or do you have. you know.
playback and tracks

837
00:57:07.798 --> 00:57:09.255
and stuff like that?"

838
00:57:09.339 --> 00:57:11.964
And I said. "I have nothing
against playback and tracks.

839
00:57:12.047 --> 00:57:14.255
"but in this case everything you hear

840
00:57:14.339 --> 00:57:15.673
"coming off the stage

841
00:57:15.756 --> 00:57:18.005
is being played
by this incredible band."

842
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:28.714
Whoo!

843
00:57:45.172 --> 00:57:48.214
I figured other people were
maybe thinking the same thoughts

844
00:57:48.297 --> 00:57:49.631
as my friend was thinking.

845
00:57:49.714 --> 00:57:52.255
so I've continued to tell this story.

846
00:57:52.339 --> 00:57:54.255
but it's not enough.

847
00:57:54.339 --> 00:57:55.881
Journalists and reporters will...

848
00:57:55.964 --> 00:57:59.422
they email. and would call
my office. and they go.

849
00:57:59.506 --> 00:58:01.714
"I know what he says from the stage.

850
00:58:02.214 --> 00:58:03.422
"but really?

851
00:58:03.964 --> 00:58:05.214
Really?"

852
00:58:05.297 --> 00:58:08.214
So I thought. "Okay. we have
to put this matter to rest."

853
00:58:08.297 --> 00:58:11.005
To do that. I'm gonna
introduce the band.

854
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:12.673

We're completely untethered.

1006
01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:08.172

we like on the stage.

1008
01:11:11.214 --> 01:11:13.005
When I began to think about the show.

1009
01:11:13.089 --> 01:11:14.255

01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:18.339
well. what we humans like
looking at the most is.

1011
01:11:18.422 --> 01:11:20.339
yeah. other humans.

01:11:30.005 --> 01:11:32.047
about the show. and I wondered.

1016
01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:35.547
"What if we could eliminate
everything from the stage

1017
01:11:35.631 --> 01:11:38.714
"except the stuff

The next song was written by

1194
01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:39.464
the actress and singer Janelle Monáe.

1195
01:24:40.589 --> 01:24:42.464
She sang it at
the Women's March in Washington

1196
01:24:42.547 --> 01:24:43.589
a few years ago.

1197
01:24:43.673 --> 01:24:44.923
I was there.

1198
01:24:45.005 --> 01:24:46.464
I wrote to her a little bit afterwards

1199
01:24:46.547 --> 01:24:49.839
and asked what she would
think of a white man

1200
01:24:49.923 --> 01:24:54.506
of a certain age
singing this particular song.

1201
01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.506
The reason'll be clear in a minute.

1202
01:24:57.172 --> 01:24:58.547
She loved the idea.

1203
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:00.381
She said the song is for everyone.

1204
01:25:00.464 --> 01:25:01.589
that it's for humanity.

1205
01:25:05.964 --> 01:25:08.422
It'll be obvious
the song is a protest song.

1206
01:25:08.506 --> 01:25:10.005
It's also a requiem.

1207
01:25:10.089 --> 01:25:13.297
a requiem for lives that have
been senselessly taken.

1208
01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:16.631
I also see the song
as being about possibility.

1209
01:25:16.714 --> 01:25:18.381
the possibility of change.

1210
01:25:18.464 --> 01:25:22.339

"that we can do with this country

something that has
not been done before."

01:29:52.214 --> 01:29:53.422

01:29:53.506 --> 01:29:54.631
this from a man who has suffered

1280
01:29:54.714 --> 01:29:57.798

1288
01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:20.381
that got pruned and eliminated

1289

1290
