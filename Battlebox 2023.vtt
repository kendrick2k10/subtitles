3
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.033
Who is she?

4
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
The mama-san. she runs
things here with an iron fist.

5
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.700
Hmm.

6
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.300
So she's the GateKeeper.

7
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.233
Controls all the opium
and the women in this club

8
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.233
Exactly. if you want to have good time

9
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.100
best to follow all her rules.

10
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Yes.

11
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.967
I do want a good time.

12
00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:42.867
Oh...

13
00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.533
This smoke chokes you up.

14
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.300
Take it easy. you
need to draw it in slowly.

15
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.133
I'm not a patient man.

16
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.991
Hey!

17
00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:51.633
I got a better idea.

18
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.224
Gentlemen! No!

19
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.558
Come on darling. we just
want a little taste of you.

20
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.900
Please stop!

21
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.834
Come on. girl. just give us some love.

22
00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.959
Are you here to smoke? Oh cause trouble?

23
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.233
Oh. she's a feisty one.

24
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.500
Do you always fight during lovemaking?

25
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.458
Damn. she's a hot little bitch!

26
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.100
What's going on here?

27
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.658
It's fine.

28
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.291
Just a little passionate fun is all.

29
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.900
It's not. they are misbehaving.

30
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.767
Gentlemen. we have rules.

31
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.491
We pay you a lot of
money to have fun evening.

32
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.224
Huh? A lot of money.

33
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.567
Do you want to give us a refund?

34
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.166
Let me find you another girl this evening.

35
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.467
We have many pretty ones.
I'm sure you'll find one you like.

36
00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.867
No. no. no... We want this one.

37
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.967
And we don't mind a
little rough horse play.

38
00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.934
I heard some commotion.
is someone having a party here?

39
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.734
All be...

40
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.700
You're the two blokes that
run the Ice House Factory?

41
00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.224
Oh Mr. Chow! Oh. Mr. Chow!

42
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.633
It's so wonderful to see you here.

43
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.266
These two gentlemen I
do big business with them.

44
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
Everyone

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.767
Everyone. needs ice in the tropics.

46
00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.258
Business partners?

47
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.333
No. no...

48
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.734
Mr. Chow is our most important customer.

49
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.066
Yes. indeed.

50
00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.467
I spend a small fortune at your factory.

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.900
Mama-san

52
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.867
I think I would like to smoke my opium.

53
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600
With this young lady this evening.

54
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500
Could that be arranged?

55
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.658
Oh. actually we were just about to leave.

56
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.625
We are meeting some
friends at another club.

57
00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:42.900
Yes. Yes.

58
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.266
Brilliant! Perfect timing
on my part I guess.

59
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.233
Yes. perfect timing.

60
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.367
Did you really want her services?

61
00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.400
What might your name be?

62
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.600
Siu Fong

63
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.533
Siu Fong

64
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.367
Are you skilled into art
of rolling a bowl of opium?

65
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.800
And not burning it?

66
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.800
Yes.

67
00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:09.834
I am very skilled.

68
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.467
Ok

69
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.100
Siu Fong can roll my opium this evening.

70
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.100
Great. Mr. Chow. I will have a
servant bring in the same batch.

71
00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:21.066
The same amount like last time?

72
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.467
Definitely.

73
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.734
same amount as always.

74
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.633
Will do Mr. Chow. Will do.

75
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.667
Thank you for that.

76
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.033
Young men with money.

77
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.133
have no discipline.

78
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.333
Very bad manners at all.

79
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.843
Is this your first time
inside the Battlebox?

80
00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.100
Yes. first time.

81
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.001
You may be a bit disappointed by the decor.
but I assure you we're rather safe here.

82
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.567
We're about 60 feet below
ground. under Victoria Barracks.

83
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.767
This is the command center for
all British forces in Hong Kong.

84
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.734
It really is the nerve center.

85
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.800
Communications. signals. telegraph.

86
00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:19.066
and telephone exchange all located inside.

87
00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:22.858
Your post will be the telephone switchboard.
I assume you know how to operate one?

88
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.467
Yes. I worked the telephone
switchboard at the Royal Hotel.

89
00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.900
Very good. an expert.

90
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.100
Let me show you your post.

91
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.309
You do need a good set of ears
to filter out the background noise.

92
00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:37.224
I will be fine. sir.

93
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:38.333
That's the spirit.

94
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.858
Ah. you must be the new girl.

95
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.825
What do they call you?

96
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:42.867
Yu Mei Fong

97
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.967
Ah. welcome aboard. George Armstrong.

98
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.280
I was just giving Mei Fong
a run down of this place.

99
00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:49.633
Oh were you.

100
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.358
Well. don't listen to this chap.

101
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.100
He may have the fancy
title of British spy chief.

102
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.240
but between you and me these intelligence boys
really don't have very much in the way of...

103
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.767
Well. common sense.

104
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.800
Be careful what you
hear down here Mei Fong.

105
00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:06.800
It can be dangerous place.

106
00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.400
Don't mind George.

107
00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:09.925
He is all fire and brimstone.

108
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:12.400
Everything's solvable
with a burst of artillery.

109
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:14.258
Don't worry Charles.

110
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.233
She will soon know all our little secrets.

111
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.625
Switchies know everything
that happens in the Battlebox.

112
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.224
Who is talking to who.

113
00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:21.991
late night escapades. that sort of thing.

114
00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:23.491
Let's leave this poor girl alone.

115
00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:25.242
We don't want to scare
her on her first day.

116
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:26.967
Not on her first day. no.

117
00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.300
I do have something I want to
discuss with you though. Charles.

118
00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.158
Any questions?

119
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.900
No sir.

120
00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:36.100
Happy listening. your first call.

121
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.467
This is Mr. Chow.

122
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.600
Reports are coming in that
he's working for the other side.

123
00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:43.934
A fifth-columnist. I
thought you should know.

124
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.958
I will look into it.

125
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.367
See that you do. Charles.

126
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.633
Honestly. we have a bit
of a crisis on our hands.

127
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.200
The Japanese have been surprisingly effective at infiltrating
a vast network of potential fifth-columnists in Hong Kong.

128
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.667
They've even got some of the
bloody Triads on side. Charles.

129
00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:07.533
There's no gentle way to put this.

130
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.400
Your intelligence
operations are falling short.

131
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.734
You need to push back
hard on these bastards.

132
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.576
Shoot them in the
alleyways if you have too.

133
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.100
Outright executions!?

134
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.133
The problem with you scholar-warrior types.

135
00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.266
You never learn to pull the trigger.

136
00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:28.425
Provide me a written order
authorizing such action.

137
00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:30.533
then I will consider it.

138
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200
Just get it done. Charles!

139
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.900
He really is a loose cannon.

140
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.467
You get all types here in the Battlebox.

141
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.233
Alright men make sure
your weapons are clean.

142
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.967
A jammed rifle could
cost you your damn life.

143
00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:01.567
As a Rajput soldier in the Indian army.
we must up hold the highest of standards.

144
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.900
And today. we will scout out the
Northeast sector of the Gin Drinkers Line.

145
00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:06.513
Recently there have been some reports

146
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:09.000
of some Japanese agents
operating in the area.

147
00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.834
So make sure you're ready.
Let's go have a look-see.

148
00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:13.266
Get going.

149
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.367
He's been so hard on us lately.

150
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.433
A bit paranoid I would say.

151
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600
Yeah right.

152
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:22.934
We waste so much time
on these stupid patrols.

153
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.200
It's the same old story.

154
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.767
We haven't had a day
off and over three weeks.

155
00:08:28.066 --> 00:08:31.658
I hope that the Japanese attack us by now
so that we might have some action.

156
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.242
Is there anything you would
like to share with us Sepoy?

157
00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:34.266
No. sir.

158
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.266
Alright then. let's go.

159
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.433
Alright. follow me.

160
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.300
What has been disturbing you. Hari?

161
00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.367
Its been a long time sir. away from India.

162
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.400
Four years out here marching
up and down these hills.

163
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.667
I think I'm looking forward
to going back to Lucknow.

164
00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.066
You still have four more months. my friend.

165
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.191
You are still on duty.

166
00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:05.758
and it's not over until you're
on that ship heading back home.

167
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.867
Yes. sir. Understood sir.

168
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.166
I am trying. I'm doing my best.

169
00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:17.300
My father often used to
repeat an old Buddhist saying.

170
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.033
Learn this from water. loud splashes
the river. but the ocean depths are calm.

171
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.266
I am looking for that calm. sir.

172
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.925
This is the Army. not a Buddhist retreat.

173
00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:30.491
What is this Buddhist
stuff you are believing in?

174
00:10:30.533 --> 00:10:32.934
The same stuff that Japanese believe in.

175
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.133
Be like more of rest of us. you know?

176
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.834
I am like you guys.

177
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.967
Just a little different.

178
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.425
How the hell did I end up with
a Buddhist monk in my platoon?

179
00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:45.200
You better shape up.

180
00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:04.792
And now the latest news from Washington.

181
00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:11.024
Reports are coming that the Japanese have launched a surprise
attack on Manila. Singapore and the British Colony of Hong Kong.

182
00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:13.224
They said that these attacks
is unknown at the moment.

183
00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:17.024
but stay tuned as more updates will be
arriving from our journalists in the Pacific.

184
00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:19.500
On the European battlefront.
a German submarine...

185
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.166
General Maltby. early this morning the Japanese launched a
surprise attack on the American Naval Base on Pearl Harbor.

186
00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:32.233
Also this morning. the Japanese bombed our
Kai Tak Airfield inflicting major damage.

187
00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:34.692
In addition. We are
receiving numerous reports

188
00:11:34.734 --> 00:11:37.467
of Japanese infantry crossing
the border into Hong Kong.

189
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.633
Well. we're at War.
there's no doubt about it.

190
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.858
Have we had any reports
from the New Territories?

191
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.625
We have. sir. There are reports of Japanese
troops heading south towards Tai Po.

192
00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:49.667
They have light tanks. armored cars
and dozens of mobile artillery pieces.

193
00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:54.191
Alright. alright. alert the troops stationed
on the Eastern side of the Gin Drinkers Line.

194
00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:55.543
We'll have to send more reinforcements.

195
00:11:55.567 --> 00:11:56.191
Yes sir.

196
00:11:56.233 --> 00:11:59.800
It's the Royal Scots holding the line directly
in front of the Japanese advance. sir.

197
00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:04.700
With the Rajputs at their side along with the contingent
of Punjabi's holding the line near the Shing Mun Redoubt.

198
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.867
Mmm. this frontal assault on the Kowloon
Peninsula is probably just a diversion.

199
00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:13.800
My guess is the main Japanese attack
will still take place from the sea.

200
00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:18.500
probably by amphibious units hitting the
beaches of Repulse Bay and Deepwater Bay.

201
00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.867
Have there been any
sightings of the Japanese Fleet?

202
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:24.376
The bombing this morning at Kai Tak Airfield
disabled or destroyed all of our aircraft.

203
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.934
So we have no eyes in the sky.

204
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.100
What we really need is a couple
of battleships stationed here.

205
00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:32.767
otherwise they will blockade
the harbor and starve us to death.

206
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.100
Get an urgent cable out to Singapore
requesting help from the Royal Navy.

207
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.191
Yes. sir.

208
00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:40.867
We must maintain our ability
to resupply from the sea.

209
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.300
Mrs. Ho. I hope you
haven't been waiting for long?

210
00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:58.500
No. not at all.

211
00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:01.467
I had to visit a village anyway
for picking up some supplies.

212
00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:04.533
and plus had to pay you back for the cow.

213
00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:06.892
12 silver dollars?

214
00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:08.667
Yes. that was our agreed price.

215
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200
Thank you.

216
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.625
How's your new job going?

217
00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:12.667
Well...

218
00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:15.333
hmm. though. there's not
much I can say about it.

219
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:17.133
Sworn to secrecy so to speak.

220
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.867
Well. at least raid their pantry.

221
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.033
Keep your stomach full.

222
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.400
That British food is really fattening.

223
00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:26.734
Nothing wrong with a
little meat on your bones.

224
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.000
Mrs. Ho.

225
00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:30.900
you are now married. I still
have to find my husband!

226
00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:32.900
Come. let's have some tea.

227
00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:42.600
Mama-san

228
00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:45.900
Why has the price jumped up by 20 percent?

229
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.433
If Japanese win the fight.

230
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.867
they will just shut you down.

231
00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:54.258
Mr. Chang. I am not so
sure the place will be closed.

232
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.467
Everybody likes to have a good time.

233
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.567
I just saying.

234
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.000
20% increase.

235
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.333
not fair to long-time customer.

236
00:14:05.033 --> 00:14:08.600
Take it or leave it. that's our price.

237
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.834
I have not heard much about
you. Where were you born?

238
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400
Hmmm

239
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.767
You're not fully Chinese. are you?

240
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.700
I had a British father.

241
00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:25.133
So you are Eurasian?

242
00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:26.367
Yes

243
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.400
Well then.

244
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.591
you might like my gift
that I prepare for you.

245
00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:35.558
It's all the rage in Paris and New York.

246
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.266
Stockings! Silk stockings!

247
00:14:38.433 --> 00:14:39.433
Yes indeed.

248
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.991
These are impossible to find.

249
00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:43.900
Where did you get them?

250
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.467
That's my little secret.

251
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.958
These are so lovely.

252
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.767
And tempting too.

253
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.900
You are a little devil. caught you peeking.

254
00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:07.166
It's in my nature.

255
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.991
Another pipe. Mr. Chow?

256
00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.033
Ah...

257
00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:15.834
I have to be very careful
riding on that dragon.

258
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.058
You know. addiction can be very dangerous.

259
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.358
Oh. my. my...

260
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.500
Now you're turning into
a worrisome old man.

261
00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:25.625
We can't let that happen.

262
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:26.667
Okay.

263
00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.400
I will take one more pipe.

264
00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:31.066
Thank goodness.

265
00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:34.001
A rich man like you should enjoy your life.

266
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.001
Why waste a good time.

267
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.158
Today we have a very high quality
of opium from the Sichuan Province.

268
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.834
very smooth and refined.

269
00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:46.567
It came in yesterday.

270
00:15:46.734 --> 00:15:49.333
Smuggled across the Japanese lines?

271
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.333
I suppose so.

272
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.767
I heard a bit about the smuggling trade.

273
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.533
War can sometimes be
very good for business.

274
00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:02.558
You trade with the Japanese?

275
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.433
No

276
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.767
Not exactly. but sometimes in
order to be successful in business.

277
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.500
I do have to work all sides of the deal.

278
00:16:13.066 --> 00:16:14.800
I see.

279
00:16:16.233 --> 00:16:18.367
Do you have brother or sisters?

280
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.233
One sister.

281
00:16:21.467 --> 00:16:23.233
Oh. in Hong Kong?

282
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.767
Yeah. she works as a switchboard
operator at some government office.

283
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.233
She probably gets to
learn a lot of secrets.

284
00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:48.100
How is the opium?

285
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.333
Very good.

286
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800
Come on.

287
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.734
Have a puff.

288
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.925
So the Royal Scots are now dug in on the
Western sector of the Gin Drinkers Line.

289
00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:16.167
They still have the Punjabis
and Rajputs at the flanks.

290
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.533
But heavy fighting is just
broken out on Golden Hill. sir.

291
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.233
The Royal Scots must hold Golden Hill.

292
00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:26.792
Otherwise the Japs will
flood into Sham Shui Po.

293
00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.209
and then the rest of the Kowloon Peninsula.

294
00:17:28.233 --> 00:17:31.433
Yes sir. although we are having difficulties
reaching the frontline troops. sir.

295
00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:33.867
Our telegraph wires keep getting cut.

296
00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:35.467
Damn. fifth-columnists!

297
00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:36.325
Can it be stopped?

298
00:17:36.367 --> 00:17:37.576
It's hard to know who's who. sir.

299
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.009
Even the Triads are involved and
they work for whomever pays the most.

300
00:17:40.033 --> 00:17:43.925
Which is why we need to be operating firing
squads. sir. Cut down these traitors at the knees.

301
00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:45.591
Operationally impossible.

302
00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.543
We just don't have the
resources to track them all down.

303
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.058
Damn it Charles! Your boys need to pull their
bloody fingers out and get on top of this.

304
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.533
All right. gentlemen.

305
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.200
This is war. chaos.

306
00:17:55.367 --> 00:18:00.224
I know it's stressful. but we must keep our
focus of defending the Gin Drinkers Line.

307
00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:03.367
If that goes down the rest of the
Kowloon Peninsula goes with it.

308
00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:05.058
Continue. Mr. Armstrong.

309
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.100
Yes. sir.

310
00:18:06.133 --> 00:18:08.767
Our forces are being
pounded in Shatin. sir.

311
00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:12.533
and the enemy has a column of light tanks
crossing at Lo Wu to support.

312
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.060
This is looking like a
full frontal assault. sir.

313
00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:16.767
Bollocks!

314
00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:19.200
We need to keep a
step ahead of this. Gents.

315
00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.767
I spoke with Governor Young.

316
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:26.158
and he agreed with the proposal
of destroying any supplies located in

317
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.400
the Kowloon warehouses
that might be useful to the Japanese.

318
00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:31.991
Understood sir. I'll have the
Service Corps draw up a list.

319
00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:34.767
We'll destroy everything
we can in the next 24 hours.

320
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.233
Is that to include the port facility. sir?

321
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.191
Yes. get ready to blow up the docks.

322
00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:40.400
Yes. sir.

323
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.500
Nice and easy. let the
opium roll into your body.

324
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.367
Being here makes me
forget the world's problems.

325
00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:00.567
Yes.

326
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.767
This club is like a pond of tranquility.

327
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.333
Yeah.

328
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.567
But I really should have left Hong Kong.

329
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.667
I just didn't think the
Japanese would attack.

330
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.100
Oh. well. there's no escaping it now.

331
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.133
Should I continue?

332
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.834
Yes. maybe one more?

333
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.100
This is my only escape now.

334
00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:44.967
What are those?

335
00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:48.166
The latest fashions
from Paris and New York.

336
00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.867
Really? Looks like
fishing nets for tadpoles.

337
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.024
You're such a village girl. Mei Fong.

338
00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:56.100
I mean. look at you.

339
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.500
Well. thank goodness mother
isn't alive to see you here.

340
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.433
with male strangers and all.

341
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.667
Well. our mother wasn't
as tightly wound up as you.

342
00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:07.500
She might have liked these.

343
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.700
Is he your latest catch?

344
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.900
Why do you care?

345
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.900
I have seen him before.

346
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.800
Mr. Chow. he's one of the
richest bachelors in Hong Kong.

347
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.900
Mr Chow?

348
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.967
Seriously sister. you need to get
out more often. expand your horizons.

349
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.825
Any young men in uniform
caught your fancy yet?

350
00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:35.934
No!

351
00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:39.200
I need to help you with your wardrobe.

352
00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:43.367
The village girl look comes
across a bit old-fashioned.

353
00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:45.967
I don't need stockings to
make my legs look good.

354
00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.391
Okay. okay. I'll drop it.

355
00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:51.367
Look. I came here to tell you
that I had to sell the cow.

356
00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:54.967
With food prices rising so fast.
it would soon have been stolen.

357
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.166
Here's your share.

358
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.300
Thanks.

359
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.066
You have been taking care of
that cow for the past two years.

360
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.867
So really. it is yours.

361
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.467
Alright

362
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.133
Thank you.

363
00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:17.233
This Thursday is your birthday.

364
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.233
How about I come over?

365
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.600
That would be fun.

366
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.358
You know. this year.

367
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.066
it's the year of the snake.

368
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.658
Oh. hopefully we won't see any of those.

369
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.600
Shit. the Japs have tanks.

370
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.900
Bloody bastards. they do.

371
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.033
Sargent. Hari is hurt.

372
00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:04.834
What happened?

373
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:05.967
Vihann is dead.

374
00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:08.333
And we saw a column of
tanks on Castle Peak Road.

375
00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:09.533
Call it in! Call it in!

376
00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:10.291
Yes. sir.

377
00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:12.867
Japanese tanks have been
spotted on Castle Peak Road.

378
00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:14.876
Better warn the troops
holding the forward positions...

379
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.925
I feel really dizzy.

380
00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:17.692
You will be fine.

381
00:23:17.734 --> 00:23:19.300
You will be fine man. come on!

382
00:23:19.467 --> 00:23:21.567
You got this far. you got it.

383
00:23:22.433 --> 00:23:25.000
I can't think straight.
I can't think straight...

384
00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:45.500
Are you ok?

385
00:23:45.734 --> 00:23:47.333
Are you ok?

386
00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:58.567
Give it to my mother.

387
00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:01.633
I will.

388
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.633
With the Gin Drinkers Line broken. we're going to have to shore
up our defensive postures along the beaches of Hong Kong Island.

389
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.767
It's only a matter of time before
the Japanese make a run at it.

390
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.867
How about the Lye Mun passage. sir?

391
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.576
It's the narrowest waterway
between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.

392
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.000
Not where my focus would be. sir.

393
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.900
Our coastal gun batteries have it covered.

394
00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:57.325
If the Japanese occupy the Kowloon shore.

395
00:24:57.367 --> 00:25:00.300
they'll simply shell Hong
Kong Island to smitheries.

396
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:01.425
Maybe sir.

397
00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:05.967
But my instinct tells me the Japanese will try to
preserve Victoria. the city. at least the main buildings.

398
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.133
Did you forgot what they did in Nanking?

399
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.166
You are supposed to be the
Japanese expert. by here by God.

400
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.825
Get up to speed. old boy.

401
00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:14.767
I know full well their history.

402
00:25:14.934 --> 00:25:19.400
But in addition to looking at the historical context.
we need to consider this from a strategic point of view.

403
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.000
Nanking was not a port city.

404
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.900
If I were an admiral in the Japanese Navy.

405
00:25:25.066 --> 00:25:27.066
my objective would be
to keep the city intact.

406
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.960
They're going to need a good base in this area
for their upcoming war with the Americans.

407
00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:34.734
Well. that's a major reason why we would be
blowing up much of the port facilities.

408
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.934
Regardless. It's the Japanese Army
that's currently conducting the fight.

409
00:25:38.133 --> 00:25:40.293
The Japanese Army and Navy
don't often see eye to eye.

410
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.967
There's a lot of infighting in
Tokyo's military command.

411
00:25:43.133 --> 00:25:47.300
Charles. I understand your knowledge
of the Japanese is second to none.

412
00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:49.934
Are you perhaps giving them
more credit than they deserve?

413
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.676
I mean they have
mishandled China for years.

414
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.400
Why would they be more enlightened now?

415
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:57.934
Charles. the Japanese have proven to be
consistently inflexible in their military strategy.

416
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.500
Again and again. they've shown they prefer
to use the sledgehammer to the scalpel.

417
00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.600
Gentlemen. Pearl Harbor
happened just five days ago!

418
00:26:05.767 --> 00:26:07.166
An outlier. Charles.

419
00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:13.024
We can't adapt our entire Japanese strategy because of
one lucky strike against an enemy with their pants down.

420
00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:15.367
That operation was led
by the Japanese Navy.

421
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:18.767
After such a smashing success. I'd wager
they had the upper hand in Tokyo now.

422
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.667
Point taken.

423
00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:23.834
But it's the Japanese Army
we are currently fighting against.

424
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.467
Sir. the Japanese have sunk
HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales.

425
00:26:30.266 --> 00:26:31.433
Both ships?

426
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.867
Aye. sir. We just received
word from Singapore.

427
00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:36.600
Japanese aircraft caught
them off the coast of Malaya.

428
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.867
Both vessels lost.

429
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.333
Thank you. James.

430
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.100
Goddammit man!

431
00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:46.867
If an aircraft can sink a top
of the line British battleship.

432
00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:47.767
what next?

433
00:26:47.934 --> 00:26:50.959
Without those ships. how are
we going to resupply from the sea?

434
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:52.081
It will be impossible. sir.

435
00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:53.233
It's a bloody disaster.

436
00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:54.458
Sir.

437
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.734
If I may...

438
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.166
We are on a razor's edge
regards to morale in this city.

439
00:26:59.533 --> 00:27:01.867
In many ways we're
fighting a multi-front battle.

440
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.667
The land battle.

441
00:27:03.834 --> 00:27:04.900
the sea battle.

442
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.667
and also. a psychological battle.

443
00:27:08.033 --> 00:27:11.100
We need to be careful how this
news is released to the public.

444
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.767
The last thing we want
is panic in the streets.

445
00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:16.734
Alright.

446
00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:19.467
I want you to tell Governor Young.

447
00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:21.391
about the loss of the battleships.

448
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:22.793
He'll understand the implications.

449
00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:25.467
And caution him on how
the news should be released.

450
00:27:25.633 --> 00:27:27.000
Sir. I will send a full report.

451
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.158
Also update Brigadiers Wallis and Lawson.

452
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200
Yes. sir.

453
00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:36.001
Charles. we're going to need an up-to-date
inventory on all food and supplies on the island.

454
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.001
We're gonna have to make some painful
calculations on how long we can hold out here.

455
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.633
Yes. sir. I will get right on it.

456
00:27:42.633 --> 00:27:43.967
What a cockup!

457
00:27:44.133 --> 00:27:44.991
It changes everything.

458
00:27:45.033 --> 00:27:47.200
Bloody Japs!

459
00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:55.500
You're turning 25 now.

460
00:27:55.834 --> 00:27:58.191
Maybe it's time to find you a husband?

461
00:27:58.233 --> 00:28:00.800
Oh. sis. I don't want
one of your connections.

462
00:28:01.433 --> 00:28:04.633
I didn't mean that
silly. not from the club.

463
00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:09.000
I was thinking of maybe
someone from the village.

464
00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:10.834
A pig farmer!

465
00:28:11.834 --> 00:28:14.533
Sis. I am going to take
my time on this one.

466
00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:18.133
I want someone reliable.

467
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600
Goodness.

468
00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:22.734
Good luck with that. men...

469
00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:26.133
Well. men they often go astray.

470
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.033
Which reminds me.

471
00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:32.767
That man from the club. that Mr Chow.

472
00:28:33.433 --> 00:28:34.967
What about him?

473
00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:38.800
He is a collaborator.

474
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:40.333
A what?

475
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.725
He works for the Japanese.

476
00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:43.633
Oh Jesus. give it a break.

477
00:28:44.001 --> 00:28:46.467
You really have an overactive imagination.

478
00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:48.991
besides. how would you know who he is?

479
00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:50.767
I saw his photo at work.

480
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.600
You have to be careful.

481
00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:55.287
I can't give you any details.
nor should I be telling you this.

482
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800
Just...

483
00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:57.858
keep your distance.

484
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.000
That's all you have? A hunch?

485
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.233
He is a Japanese collaborator. get it.
and you're sleeping with the enemy!

486
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.200
Jesus. give it a break!

487
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.200
Don't give me that bloody
nonsense. not from you.

488
00:29:11.767 --> 00:29:14.792
Opium. prostitution.
that club has a reputation.

489
00:29:14.834 --> 00:29:15.834
My job.

490
00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:17.158
pay for this house.

491
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.266
So you're benefiting from my work.

492
00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:21.667
Don't be such a lily-white righteous bitch.

493
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.734
My fucking job allows you for
your holier-than-thou lifestyle.

494
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.600
Really? Is that how you see it?

495
00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:29.767
I was the one who took care of mother.

496
00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:30.934
You left!

497
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.233
Because we are fucking dirt poor.

498
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.133
No rice. no pigs.

499
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.300
No income!

500
00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:38.767
Someone in our family has to make a living.

501
00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:40.367
That's not how it is.

502
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.734
You detest village life. you
found the city more glamorous.

503
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.133
You never liked it here.

504
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.266
Have you finished preaching?

505
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.200
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.367
But this war...

507
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.066
This war is making the city more dangerous.

508
00:29:57.934 --> 00:29:58.934
And...

509
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.967
if you ever want to come back.

510
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.533
Stay here.

511
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.200
You're always welcome.

512
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.100
You think Hong Kong
will fall to the Japanese?

513
00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:10.001
Hong Kong is a fortress.

514
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:13.467
We are surrounded by the
water. the sea just like England.

515
00:30:13.633 --> 00:30:15.867
If the Germans failed to invade Britain.

516
00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:19.000
then the Japanese most certainly
will fail attacking this island.

517
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.166
That is not what I'm hearing
from inside the Battlebox.

518
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.000
Things are not as rosy as you may see.

519
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.433
As you may read in the papers.

520
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600
We are on our own Mei Fong.

521
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.133
There's no backup plan for us.

522
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.734
Our British father abandoned us as kids.

523
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.367
Our Chinese mother died of overwork.

524
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.000
We are just a couple of Eurasian kids
stuck in the middle of nowhere.

525
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.400
Nowhere!

526
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.467
We don't have many choice.

527
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.567
Just be careful of Mr. Chow.

528
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.867
He is working for the wrong side.

529
00:30:53.734 --> 00:30:54.734
And...

530
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.066
I'm just saying.

531
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.000
At the end. at the end of all this...

532
00:30:59.133 --> 00:31:01.834
You have to choose a side. we all do.

533
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.400
There is no middle ground.

534
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.491
According to this communication
we received four days ago.

535
00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:17.734
There are 50.000 KMT troops heading
directly for us across the Canton Province.

536
00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:19.934
Ah. that would be a God-send.

537
00:31:20.266 --> 00:31:23.725
Really smash up the rear
guard of the Japanese forces.

538
00:31:23.767 --> 00:31:26.233
put their heads in a vice.
knock the stuffing out of them.

539
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.266
Yes sir. we're expecting
them in seven days.

540
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.867
Charles. any confirmation
on these troop movements?

541
00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:31.991
Unfortunately not. sir.

542
00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:33.900
We have agents all over Canton Province.

543
00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:37.400
but no verifiable reports of any large
KMT units operating in the area.

544
00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:40.333
Then we need more agents on the ground.
find out what's happening.

545
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.400
We can't have another military cockup.

546
00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:45.200
I'm just saying.
there's no confirmation of these troops.

547
00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:48.300
It's right here on this
piece of paper. Charles.

548
00:31:48.633 --> 00:31:49.934
50.000 troops.

549
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.500
It's right here!

550
00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:53.934
That message proves nothing!

551
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.166
First we lose the battleships.

552
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.458
Then the Gin Drinkers Line fails.

553
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.767
and now we don't know whether 50.000
KMT troops might be nothing but a mirage.

554
00:32:03.133 --> 00:32:04.834
How could things get so messed up?

555
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.600
Sir.

556
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.834
I'm only saying this
message makes no sense.

557
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.633
The KMT lacked the resources
to move their troops quickly.

558
00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:17.166
I would estimate if the information is true.
the likely arrival date would be mid-January.

559
00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:19.233
We can't wait until mid-January. sir.

560
00:32:19.567 --> 00:32:21.600
We can barely hold out until next week.

561
00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:25.658
Get an urgent word out to Chiang Kai-shek
on the urgent need for his troops.

562
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.958
Surely. he'll understand the importance of
maintaining a British presence here in Hong Kong.

563
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.591
Yes sir.

564
00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:32.033
I'll send another cable.

565
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.033
What is that?

566
00:32:39.367 --> 00:32:40.876
Captain Singh. go see what that's about?

567
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.967
Yes. sir.

568
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.767
General. I would caution.

569
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.000
If the KMT confirmed troops are on the way.

570
00:32:51.367 --> 00:32:53.191
they frequently say one
thing then do another.

571
00:32:53.233 --> 00:32:54.325
Understood.

572
00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:56.333
But we're walking a tightrope here.

573
00:32:56.667 --> 00:33:00.200
The KMT's imminent arrival has
boosted morale here in Hong Kong.

574
00:33:00.533 --> 00:33:02.700
If the news turns out to be false.

575
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.058
Well...

576
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.900
It might be best to keep things quiet.

577
00:33:06.233 --> 00:33:08.934
There's no doubt the
Japanese noose is tightening.

578
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.734
Maybe it's better to have
people think help is on its way.

579
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.467
Otherwise we'll have trouble
holding the Colony together.

580
00:33:15.333 --> 00:33:17.892
Sir. it is the damn sentry relief. sir.

581
00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:19.258
One of them dropped his Bren Gun.

582
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.325
Negligent discharge. Sepoy
Ghulam Rasul is shot in the stomach.

583
00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.910
Calm down. Captain. pull yourself together.

584
00:33:23.934 --> 00:33:25.100
Calm?

585
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.133
This is an amateur stupidity.

586
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.333
You would not ask me to calm if
it was one of the British soldiers.

587
00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:33.433
I know when we are retreating from Kowloon.

588
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.100
Indians are going to be the
last ones. always the last.

589
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:36.925
Right?

590
00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:40.591
You'll get the Scots out first. and we
are going to be the cannon fodder again.

591
00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:43.633
Stand aside. Captain. that will
be Brigadier Wallis's decision.

592
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.633
He'll do what's best.

593
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.734
Yes. sir.

594
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:13.967
Over there!

595
00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:16.767
Over there. over there!

596
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.433
Behind the tree!

597
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.967
There is so many of them!

598
00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:28.166
We are being surrounded.

599
00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:30.858
Behind the tree!

600
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.900
Got him.

601
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.166
They are circling us. they
are circling us everywhere.

602
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.767
There must be over 20 Japs out there!

603
00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:49.743
They are shredding us apart.

604
00:34:49.767 --> 00:34:50.925
Cover our flanks!

605
00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:52.533
They are coming in.

606
00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:55.800
I am running low on ammunition.

607
00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:56.925
How much you have?

608
00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:58.133
Four more rounds. sir.

609
00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.700
Make it count!

610
00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:04.633
Fucking Japs!

611
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.400
I'm out. I'm out!

612
00:35:07.834 --> 00:35:09.100
I'm done. sir!

613
00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:34.400
On your knees!

614
00:36:12.967 --> 00:36:15.100
I thought you would leave by now.

615
00:36:15.467 --> 00:36:19.500
Where would I go? Singapore. Manila?

616
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.967
The whole World is blown to bits.

617
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.467
One of my friends went to Macau.

618
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.333
All the refugees are going to Macau.

619
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.500
Who's gonna feed them all?

620
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.266
I guess here is better than.

621
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.700
Ah. you never know what's
gonna happen tomorrow. though.

622
00:36:37.533 --> 00:36:39.033
At times of War.

623
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.033
everything is unexpected.

624
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.333
Another pipe?

625
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.300
Maybe I can smoke my way to Macau.

626
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.667
Ladies...

627
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.300
be careful cooking the opium tonight.
It's getting very expensive.

628
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.834
Even the more experienced smugglers are
having problems bringing opium into the city.

629
00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:17.767
With all the fighting going on.
I suppose. our business will go down.

630
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.066
Don't be so sure. We have
a very compelling product.

631
00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:23.266
Our women?

632
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.667
Opium. our clients need their daily fix.

633
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.734
You know before working at the Pearl Club.
I used to work at a club in Canton.

634
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:36.333
Mostly Japanese customers.
wealthy merchants. top brass.

635
00:37:36.934 --> 00:37:39.867
It was one of the best
clubs in all of South China.

636
00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:41.158
Good money?

637
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.600
Very good. very profitable. too.

638
00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:46.834
But. you know. sometimes a bad customer.

639
00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.400
You know the type.

640
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.767
Yeah. always try to avoid those guys.

641
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.767
I noticed you are spending
a lot of time with Mr. Chow.

642
00:37:58.533 --> 00:37:59.834
Do you like him?

643
00:38:00.033 --> 00:38:02.467
Mr. Chow. he's very generous.

644
00:38:02.633 --> 00:38:04.633
Treat me with good respect.

645
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.066
I noticed he was at the
Canton Club a few times.

646
00:38:09.567 --> 00:38:12.300
Always with high
ranking Japanese officials.

647
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.467
Yes. he smuggled goods throughout
all of China. even to the Japanese.

648
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.000
Yeah. well. they were mostly military
officials and they paid for everything.

649
00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.800
the best opium. the best girls.

650
00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:26.625
Mr. Chow did not pay?

651
00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:28.001
That was the funny part.

652
00:38:28.166 --> 00:38:31.967
Mostly the wealthy merchants who hosted
the Japanese to gain favorites and such.

653
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.734
But not Mr. Chow.
It worked the other way for him.

654
00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:38.467
The Japanese treated
Mr. Chow. very. very well.

655
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.834
Hmm. I see.

656
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.333
Anyways. just be careful.

657
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.500
The tricky men can seem the most kind

658
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.633
It's not like I'm about to marry him.

659
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.467
You know. he was married once.

660
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.066
His wife died in a bombing
in Shanghai a few years ago.

661
00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:58.300
Probably gang related.

662
00:38:58.633 --> 00:39:01.667
But at least that's what I heard
from one of the girls at the club.

663
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.533
It's hard to know who
is fighting who in China.

664
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.233
Japanese. KMT. Triads.

665
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.200
Communists...

666
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.333
The lines keep shifting.

667
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.633
And the money keeps rolling in.

668
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.500
I suppose.

669
00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:21.700
it's all about the money.

670
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.767
We are all slaves to it.

671
00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:46.033
Sir.

672
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.376
We couldn't reach some
of the Rajput units in time.

673
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.500
They were scattered during the fighting.

674
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.020
Some of them may not received orders to fall
back to Hong Kong Island when we evacuated.

675
00:39:56.967 --> 00:39:58.800
If they didn't make it back.

676
00:39:59.934 --> 00:40:01.900
nothing we can do for them now.

677
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.867
The Island is all we have now boys.

678
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.867
And the Japs aren't going to
stand for that for much longer.

679
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.266
Chin up. lads...

680
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.900
We're not dead yet.

681
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.834
Do you know this man?

682
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.834
No. not really.

683
00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:40.367
What do you mean. not really?

684
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.100
I heard you speak about him briefly.

685
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.001
And?

686
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.867
And he may be a bad
person from what I have heard.

687
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.333
Any other connection with this man?

688
00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:55.333
No.

689
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.800
You have a sister named
Yu Siu Fong. do you not?

690
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.667
Yes. I do.

691
00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:06.433
Did you break security protocol and reveal
anything to your sister about Mr. Chow?

692
00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:09.567
You did. didn't you?

693
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.734
Yes a little bit. but just to protect her.

694
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.667
Do you remember your first day here?

695
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.500
Do you remember the conversation I had with the Colonel
about Mr. Chow when I put his photo down on your desk?

696
00:41:27.633 --> 00:41:28.558
Yes. I remember.

697
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.600
You see Mei Fong. that was a test.

698
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.200
We wanted to see if
you would spill the beans.

699
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.100
Here inside the Battlebox.
secrecy is of the utmost importance.

700
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.834
If we have people working here
revealing details of our operations.

701
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.300
Then effectively we have a leak.

702
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.633
And guess who's in
charge of fixing those leaks?

703
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.133
I suppose you are.

704
00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:05.900
Quite right.

705
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.066
Where are the others? Answer!

706
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.533
We don't know. sir.

707
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.200
Where are the other soldiers?

708
00:42:27.367 --> 00:42:28.367
Talk!

709
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.767
I don't know. sir.

710
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.133
Search them.

711
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.667
What have you got?
- Nothing. sir.

712
00:42:33.834 --> 00:42:35.934
What have you got?
- Nothing. sir.

713
00:42:36.066 --> 00:42:37.066
Maps?

714
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.333
Documents?

715
00:42:38.667 --> 00:42:40.066
Money?

716
00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:41.734
I have some in my left pocket.

717
00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:45.558
What else?

718
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.834
I have nothing more.
sir. I have nothing more.

719
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.358
You find anything?

720
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.266
Watch. coins. nothing else.

721
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.767
I guess the British don't pay you much.

722
00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:01.133
Is this worth your life?

723
00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:08.266
Soldier! Execute them!

724
00:43:08.867 --> 00:43:10.500
Follow me. we are going back.

725
00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:12.834
No. please don't kill me! No!

726
00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:14.124
Don't kill me!

727
00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:15.433
No. no...

728
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.000
No!

729
00:43:19.033 --> 00:43:20.934
Have mercy.

730
00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:23.767
Have mercy!

731
00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:25.800
Don't do this!

732
00:43:25.967 --> 00:43:27.200
No. don't do this.

733
00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:31.867
Don't do this. No.

734
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.100
No.

735
00:43:57.433 --> 00:43:58.625
Buddhist charm?

736
00:43:58.667 --> 00:43:59.667
Yes it is.

737
00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:02.967
Buddhist charm. it's a Buddhist charm.

738
00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:40.758
Sir.

739
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.166
We have received
communication from Sai Wan Ho

740
00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:45.233
that the Japanese have
landed a sizable force

741
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.166
on the eastern part of Hong Kong Island.

742
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.333
Where exactly?

743
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.967
The Lye Mun Passage. sir.

744
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.000
It's probably just a diversion.

745
00:44:52.867 --> 00:44:56.400
That sector doesn't have a good
landing sites for a large Japanese force.

746
00:44:56.767 --> 00:44:59.200
How could they land their
armor or artillery pieces?

747
00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:00.834
Let's not take the bait.

748
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.058
The beaches of Deepwater Bay. Repulse Bay.

749
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.458
or a direct amphibious assault
from Tsim Sha Tsui to Victoria

750
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.200
are still the most likely
points for a Japanese entry.

751
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.066
The Lye Mun Passage is
probably just a diversion.

752
00:45:13.233 --> 00:45:13.792
Sir.

753
00:45:13.834 --> 00:45:16.158
While the southern beaches
would make better landing zones.

754
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.467
The Lye Man Passage is the narrowest
waterway. only a few hundred yards.

755
00:45:20.633 --> 00:45:22.633
Japanese troops could actually swim across.

756
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.091
Swim across. really Charles?
With all their equipment?

757
00:45:25.133 --> 00:45:27.509
Are there any reports of how
many boats the Japanese are using?

758
00:45:27.533 --> 00:45:29.400
It's pitch black outside. sir.

759
00:45:29.633 --> 00:45:31.376
It's difficult for our
spotters to get an estimate.

760
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.300
but the reports seem to indicate
a few small fishing vessels.

761
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.333
You can't land an Army
on a few fishing boats.

762
00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:39.400
Remember Dunkirk?

763
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.100
They're over 800 vessels at Dunkirk.

764
00:45:43.266 --> 00:45:47.834
The Japanese will be lucky to find 20 or
30 fishing boats. We sank everything else.

765
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.892
They could still swim across in 20 minutes.

766
00:45:49.934 --> 00:45:52.333
It's darker than the devil's
asshole out there. Charles!

767
00:45:52.533 --> 00:45:53.900
No one's swimming anywhere!

768
00:45:54.066 --> 00:45:56.266
Colonel. I agree it would be a bold move.

769
00:45:56.433 --> 00:46:00.400
but not impossible to move thousands
of troops by swimming across the channel.

770
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.967
Even if by some miracle they
managed to swim to the other side.

771
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.800
their rifles would be sopping wet. Charles.

772
00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:10.166
Be about as useful as a soggy crumpet.

773
00:46:10.233 --> 00:46:12.433
On the surface. yes. it
would seem foolhardy.

774
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.000
But Pearl Harbor was also a
bold move that paid off brilliantly.

775
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.467
Can we get any confirmation on the size
of the Japanese landings?

776
00:46:19.734 --> 00:46:20.734
Yes. sir.

777
00:46:20.767 --> 00:46:22.700
Sir. I know we're flying blind here.

778
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:25.427
But by the time that report gets
back to us. it may be too late.

779
00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:27.066
It's only a 20 minute swim.

780
00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:31.000
In an hour or two. there could be thousands
of Japanese troops on Hong Kong Island.

781
00:46:47.433 --> 00:46:49.066
Hello. operator?

782
00:46:49.433 --> 00:46:50.433
Yes.

783
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.934
Please can you patch me
through to the Pearl Club?

784
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.166
Yes. thank you.

785
00:46:57.867 --> 00:46:59.467
Hello. mama-san?

786
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.333
It's me. Mei Fong. Siu Fong's sister.

787
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.367
Please may I speak to her?

788
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.867
Yes. it is urgent.

789
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.001
Siu Fong. it's me.

790
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.500
Listen. I have something
important to give you.

791
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.600
Please can you come round in person?

792
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.800
No. I can't explain to
you on the phone... No...

793
00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:25.033
Alright.

794
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.533
Okay. I will see you in a few hours.

795
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.533
Bye.

796
00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:53.900
Everybody out!

797
00:47:54.834 --> 00:47:56.667
Everyone out!

798
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.000
Everyone out!

799
00:48:00.533 --> 00:48:01.900
Everyone out!

800
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.600
Everyone out!

801
00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:08.767
Everyone out!

802
00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.066
Everybody out!

803
00:48:16.667 --> 00:48:18.633
Everybody out!

804
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:22.500
Everybody out!

805
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.700
The Japanese

806
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.900
The Japanese

807
00:49:03.934 --> 00:49:05.200
The Japanese...

808
00:49:05.967 --> 00:49:07.200
What happened to you?

809
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.633
Most of the island has
fallen to the Japanese.

810
00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:12.934
The roads are blocked. and I just
came back from Sheung Wan District.

811
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.834
Is it still under the British control?

812
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.200
Yes. but the Japanese have
taken over Queen Mary Hospital.

813
00:49:18.367 --> 00:49:20.600
They're attacking the villages in the area.

814
00:49:20.767 --> 00:49:21.892
Puk Fu Lam?

815
00:49:21.934 --> 00:49:23.200
Yes. probably.

816
00:49:23.367 --> 00:49:25.333
The city is collapsing.

817
00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:27.066
Alright. ladies.

818
00:49:27.233 --> 00:49:29.100
Ladies...

819
00:49:31.867 --> 00:49:33.600
It's just a little bump in the road.

820
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.667
In reality. in desperate times.

821
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.133
a little opium will sooth
many ills of the world.

822
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.066
Our business can survive a war.

823
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.700
Maybe different customers.
different uniforms.

824
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.001
But at the end. there's always
a human need to have a good time.

825
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.033
Besides. I will double your
wages at the end of the month.

826
00:49:58.367 --> 00:50:01.600
Mama-san. I need to go to see my sister.

827
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.100
I see. alright. be careful.
it's dangerous outside.

828
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.166
We cannot surrender. Charles.

829
00:50:18.333 --> 00:50:23.000
We have orders direct from Prime Minister
Churchill that we're to fight to the last man.

830
00:50:23.166 --> 00:50:25.066
Colonel. our men have done their duty.

831
00:50:25.233 --> 00:50:28.467
thousands dead on the battlefield.
thousands more badly injured and dying.

832
00:50:28.633 --> 00:50:31.142
You expect the Japanese to honor
any sort of surrender agreement?

833
00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:34.124
The second we put our guns down.
we're as good as dead.

834
00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:37.491
We've lost control. Our troops are
scattered. They're operating blind.

835
00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:38.900
Then we fight blind. Charles!

836
00:50:39.066 --> 00:50:40.325
We have our orders!

837
00:50:40.367 --> 00:50:42.700
But at a certain point
is becomes pointless!

838
00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:45.500
We can't resupply them with
ammunition. much less food.

839
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:46.425
Sir.

840
00:50:46.467 --> 00:50:49.343
We just received reports the Japanese
have taken over Tai Tam water reservoir.

841
00:50:49.367 --> 00:50:51.900
Nonsense. I was just talking to Jack Flegg.

842
00:50:52.233 --> 00:50:53.725
Get him on the blower now!

843
00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:54.767
Sir.

844
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.133
Hello

845
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.700
Hello

846
00:51:02.867 --> 00:51:05.333
Sir. it sounds like they're
speaking Japanese.

847
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.792
Put it on speaker.

848
00:51:06.834 --> 00:51:07.834
Yes. sir.

849
00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:11.033
Hello. Tommy...

850
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.233
Hello. Tommy?

851
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.066
Yes...

852
00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:35.934
What did they say?

853
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.633
They're coming for us.

854
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.066
Like bullocks. they are.

855
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.533
They shut off water to the city.

856
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.176
The Japanese are forcing our hand.
our troops can't fight without water.

857
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.743
We are in the bloody tropics. Charles!
There is water everywhere.

858
00:51:47.767 --> 00:51:50.433
Our boys still have a
few days in the tank yet.

859
00:51:50.934 --> 00:51:52.900
What about the local population?

860
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.834
There are always casualties. Charles!

861
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.700
Mei Fong

862
00:52:31.734 --> 00:52:33.500
Mei Fong

863
00:52:35.467 --> 00:52:37.266
Mei Fong. listen to me.

864
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.500
Who did this to you?

865
00:52:46.133 --> 00:52:47.300
Oh...

866
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.734
Now listen to me. Mei Fong.

867
00:52:58.033 --> 00:52:59.433
Mei Fong!!!

868
00:53:02.767 --> 00:53:04.834
I love you!

869
00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:26.033
Who did that to you?

870
00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.233
It's Lieutenant Colonel
Stewart. sir. in Wan Chai.

871
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.200
He says they can't hold
the line much longer.

872
00:54:24.367 --> 00:54:26.734
Alright. put him on the speaker.

873
00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:30.233
Hello?

874
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.591
Stuart. Maltby here.

875
00:54:31.633 --> 00:54:33.158
Maltby...? Is that you?

876
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.224
Yes. it's General Maltby.
What's your status?

877
00:54:35.266 --> 00:54:38.333
The line is breaking. sir.
We can't hold out much longer!

878
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.567
Any reserves? Anything that
can plug up the gap?

879
00:54:40.767 --> 00:54:44.425
No one sir. We have no reserves.
Everyone is on the line already.

880
00:54:45.166 --> 00:54:46.958
Hello. Stuart... Stuart!

881
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.467
We have Japs inside!

882
00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:49.958
Godamnit! The doorway...

883
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:51.892
Stuart

884
00:54:51.934 --> 00:54:53.100
Are you there?

885
00:54:53.266 --> 00:54:54.266
Stuart!!!

886
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.633
Can you reconnect?

887
00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.700
No. sir. the line is down.

888
00:55:01.967 --> 00:55:03.233
I think it's time.

889
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.800
With all due respect. sir. a surrender here
will tarnish our reputation across Asia.

890
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.467
Yes. and so would a civilian
massacre if we continue to resist.

891
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.291
Sir. the Japanese cannot be trusted.

892
00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:17.367
think of Nanking. 300.000 dead.

893
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.476
With the city's water supply shut
off. we are already at the Japs mercy.

894
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.500
Please. sir.

895
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.800
The men can fight on.

896
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.200
One final fight.

897
00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:28.800
Make them pay a bloody toll for
every street. every building in the city.

898
00:55:30.066 --> 00:55:34.333
The civilian population would be
caught up in the crossfire. thousands dead.

899
00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:41.800
Being taken prisoner by the Japanese
would be worse than death. sir.

900
00:55:44.033 --> 00:55:45.767
They will break us.

901
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:49.033
and they will butcher us.

902
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.233
one by one.

903
00:55:52.133 --> 00:55:54.333
It will test our resolve. no doubt.

904
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.900
But to save this city. that's a sacrifice
we're going to have to make.

905
00:55:58.233 --> 00:56:00.567
Our men have paid a heavier price.

906
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.834
And your legacy. sir?

907
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.433
How will you be remembered?

908
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.567
Good night. gentlemen.

909
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.033
16 pipes. Mr. Chow.

910
00:56:31.734 --> 00:56:33.800
Do you still desire another?

911
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.500
What is my devilish reward if I continue?

912
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.033
You already spent a
small fortune. Mr. Chow.

913
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.600
Do you still have enough
silver coin for the evening?

914
00:56:45.934 --> 00:56:47.467
Is that enough for you?

915
00:56:47.633 --> 00:56:50.700
For for a pipe. yes. for a pipe.

916
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.734
I want the special treatment.

917
00:56:56.233 --> 00:56:59.767
The aroma of companionship.

918
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.600
Have you heard of riding the purple mist?

919
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:16.133
Do my handful of silver allow me
entrance into this enchanted land?

920
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.667
Are you seeing colors. Mr. Chow?

921
00:57:46.433 --> 00:57:51.033
Many colors. more than
the shades of any rainbow.

922
00:57:55.066 --> 00:57:56.867
Mr Chow

923
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.400
Long time no see.

924
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.333
What game are you playing this evening?

925
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.967
It's...

926
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:10.033
Riding mists. purple
clouds. and double rainbows.

927
00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:11.533
Something like that.

928
00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:13.433
I have heard of that one.

929
00:58:13.633 --> 00:58:16.834
Very. very decadent of you. Mr. Chow.

930
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.100
With the world collapsing. why not?

931
00:58:21.433 --> 00:58:23.800
Hmm. I see. Well then...

932
00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:26.800
Let me suggest you a very special delight.

933
00:58:26.967 --> 00:58:30.333
Something not normally
permitted inside this club.

934
00:58:30.967 --> 00:58:32.166
Oh. really?

935
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.100
Yes. an extension on an ongoing theme.

936
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.967
A double delicacy. riding two purple mists.

937
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.200
I will be in heaven then.

938
00:58:47.767 --> 00:58:52.367
Yes. you will be receiving the
sweet taste of heaven tonight.

939
00:59:46.033 --> 00:59:48.800
Your tea is ready.

940
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.667
Mr. Chow. drink it.

941
01:00:15.767 --> 01:00:18.200
Maybe best if you get dressed and leave.

942
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.233
Addiction can be deadly. Mr. Chow.

943
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.367
Maybe you picked the wrong side.

944
01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:03.266
Sir. we've lost all
contact with Mount Davis.

945
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.400
What about the Winnipeg
Grenadiers in Wan Chai gap?

946
01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:08.500
Those communication lines are also down.

947
01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:09.991
Can we send a messenger?

948
01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.567
Sir. the Japanese are
only a thousand yards away.

949
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.400
It's unlikely we will reach
anyone outside our sector. sir.

950
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.900
Any word from Governor Young?

951
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.158
He wants us to continue
fighting. no surrender.

952
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.467
Good man. Young.

953
01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:22.967
Finally. some sense!

954
01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:25.266
We can't give them Christmas boys.

955
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.166
Gents. the Hong Kong Fortress was supposed
to hold out for at least three months.

956
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.767
At least that was the plan.

957
01:01:31.934 --> 01:01:37.100
Churchill did realize this outpost
was just that. an outpost.

958
01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:40.200
They knew full well in London
we were destined to fail.

959
01:01:40.567 --> 01:01:44.400
Yes. well. here we are
at the edge. still fighting.

960
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.266
But for how long?

961
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.300
George

962
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.734
I'd like to have a word with all the men
and women stationed here in the Battlebox.

963
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.300
Go and gather everyone into the room.

964
01:02:02.033 --> 01:02:03.133
Yes. sir.

965
01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.734
What happened?

966
01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:24.066
I don't know. 20-30 pipes maybe.
A rich man with too much opium.

967
01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.800
His heart has stopped.

968
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.467
He was turning purple. then collapsed.

969
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.567
We need to put a lid on this.

970
01:02:32.967 --> 01:02:36.667
Blame it on heart attack.
natural cause. less fuss.

971
01:02:37.033 --> 01:02:38.967
Yes. that's probably the best.

972
01:02:39.533 --> 01:02:41.800
Okay. okay. God damn it.

973
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.967
Such a rich man. we
could have made a fortune.

974
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.500
had he stayed alive a few more years.

975
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.066
What are tragedy.

976
01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.633
A big loss all around.

977
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.367
I have to now go file a police report
and someone has informed his daughter.

978
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.800
His daughter?

979
01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.033
Yes. poor girl.

980
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.467
She lost her mother a
few years ago and now this.

981
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.066
Do you like kids?

982
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.467
Yeah.

983
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.567
Maybe you can go. you
know. see the daughter.

984
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.433
I don't know.

985
01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.400
I just... don't know.

986
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.367
What a God damn mess.

987
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.800
Sir. the ladies and gentlemen
of your General Staff are present. sir.

988
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.100
For 17 long days.

989
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.867
we've done our best to defend this
small outpost of the British Empire.

990
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.400
I have no idea how history will judge us.

991
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.600
For 100 years. British Hong Kong has been a
successful trading post on the far end of Asia.

992
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.400
For years. it's been known
as the Eastern Fortress.

993
01:04:38.567 --> 01:04:41.700
A rock of fortitude in a troubled region.

994
01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.033
We all know.

995
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.333
that war is a nasty business.

996
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.834
We've lost many good
men during this battle.

997
01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.066
May God rest their souls.

998
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.266
Their sacrifice must never be forgotten.

999
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.600
They have fought with
determination. with bravery.

1000
01:04:59.934 --> 01:05:01.900
with a united front.

1001
01:05:02.734 --> 01:05:05.767
No British general could
have hoped for more.

1002
01:05:06.867 --> 01:05:10.967
Well. now we're at a crossroads
and difficult decisions lie ahead.

1003
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:15.867
I know. that many may disagree
with what I have to say next.

1004
01:05:16.734 --> 01:05:19.367
But please bear with
me in this desperate hour.

1005
01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:25.700
I have decided that we shall offer
our surrender to the Japanese forces.

1006
01:05:26.533 --> 01:05:28.300
It's a God awful choice.

1007
01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:31.834
But as commander of the
British forces here in Hong Kong.

1008
01:05:32.001 --> 01:05:33.558
I have come to the conclusion.

1009
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.433
that it's only right decision.

1010
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.266
for the future of the city.

1011
01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.066
for its people.

1012
01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:41.133
and for our exhausted soldiers

1013
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.900
who are run out of supplies and ammunition

1014
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.233
to carry on the fight.

1015
01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.834
And so...

1016
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.200
My last mission today will
be to meet Governor Young.

1017
01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:54.600
to provide a full assessment
of our grim situation.

1018
01:05:55.667 --> 01:06:01.001
If he agrees that coming to terms with
the Japanese as our only viable option.

1019
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:05.767
Then our formal surrender will probably
take place later this afternoon.

1020
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:08.734
Well...

1021
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.100
Thank you all for your steadfast service.

1022
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.367
I stand before you now.
defeated but resolute.

1023
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.667
No British general can ever
prepare for a day like this.

1024
01:06:22.934 --> 01:06:23.967
But...

1025
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.433
remember.

1026
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:27.967
no Empire lasts forever.

1027
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.467
We might have lost the battle.

1028
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.066
but we have not lost the war.

1029
01:06:33.233 --> 01:06:35.633
And with America's
recent entry into the conflict.

1030
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.166
I believe. the tide of War will change.

1031
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.166
And with grit and determination.

1032
01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:47.066
our future destiny is yet to be written.

1033
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.633
Hong Kong will be reborn again.

1034
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.433
Well. take care.

1035
01:06:56.533 --> 01:06:57.567
And...

1036
01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.734
May God save the King.

1037
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.800
Ahh...

1038
01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:44.967
Help!

1039
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.367
You okay?

1040
01:07:48.533 --> 01:07:50.100
Do you have water?

1041
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800
Yeah.

1042
01:07:52.133 --> 01:07:53.934
Yes. of course.

1043
01:08:04.133 --> 01:08:05.500
What's going on out there?

1044
01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:08.033
The British surrendered today.
- What?

1045
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.467
What day is it?

1046
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.433
25th of December.

1047
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.200
That's the British Christmas Day.

1048
01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:15.433
That's a weird day to surrender.

1049
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:19.700
Yeah. actually. I'm looking
for a village called Shek O.

1050
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.001
Do you know of it?

1051
01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:23.133
It's up that way.

1052
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.525
Thank you for the water.

1053
01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:25.425
Oh. no. no. no...

1054
01:08:25.467 --> 01:08:28.133
Keep it. there is food
inside. You will need it.

1055
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.100
Thank you so much.

1056
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.333
Nina. give us the room. please.

1057
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.433
You have some explaining to do. Charles.

1058
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.900
Our agent. Mr. Chow is dead.

1059
01:09:16.633 --> 01:09:18.500
Good God.

1060
01:09:20.133 --> 01:09:22.233
Assassinated?

1061
01:09:24.867 --> 01:09:27.066
Look familiar?

1062
01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:33.934
Poisoned...

1063
01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:37.400
You tell me. that is
your handwriting. isn't it?

1064
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.467
Yes. that's my note.

1065
01:09:44.233 --> 01:09:46.767
This poison was to be given to Mr. Chow.

1066
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.967
He was to use it on an operation
against some fifith-columnists.

1067
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.133
For fucks sake. Charles.

1068
01:09:52.533 --> 01:09:56.367
Do they let just anyone in the
Intelligence Corps these days?

1069
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.100
Someone has to hang for this
and you better hope it's not you!

1070
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.367
I gave this poison to Mei Fong.

1071
01:10:05.767 --> 01:10:06.767
Mei Fong?

1072
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.400
She was to deliver it to her
sister who knows Mr. Chow.

1073
01:10:09.867 --> 01:10:11.700
The instructions were very clear.

1074
01:10:11.867 --> 01:10:13.658
The poison was to be handed to Mr. Chow.

1075
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.400
Why would Mei Fong get this job?

1076
01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:18.934
Because our soldiers are either
dead. injured or fighting the Japs!

1077
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.266
I can't spare men running
deliveries around this city.

1078
01:10:22.433 --> 01:10:24.467
Jesus!

1079
01:10:27.533 --> 01:10:30.567
You've lost your touch. Charles.

1080
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.834
So...

1081
01:10:34.633 --> 01:10:36.600
Was she a Japanese spy?

1082
01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:38.133
I don't...

1083
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.900
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1084
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.033
He was our man. Charles.

1085
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.633
He'd infiltrated Japanese High Command.

1086
01:10:50.934 --> 01:10:57.200
He was going to keep funneling information
to London while we rot away in some POW Camp.

1087
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.567
Years of work. Charles.

1088
01:11:01.734 --> 01:11:02.834
Years!!!

1089
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.567
Down the fucking drain!

1090
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.700
Well. I hope you're proud of yourself.

1091
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.266
You absolute.

1092
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.467
fucking imbecile!

1093
01:12:31.734 --> 01:12:33.200
I...

1094
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.333
I am sorry.

1095
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.700
This is Charles Fisher at the Battlebox.

1096
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.600
I am calling to check on his daughter.

1097
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.967
Make sure someone is looking after her.

1098
01:12:55.734 --> 01:12:57.200
Is she alright?

1099
01:12:57.734 --> 01:12:58.767
Yes.

1100
01:12:59.133 --> 01:13:00.567
She is.

1101
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.325
I'm sure the news of his
death was a big shock.

1102
01:13:03.367 --> 01:13:04.867
It certainly was for us here.

1103
01:13:05.033 --> 01:13:07.800
Probably killed by a fifth-columnist.

1104
01:13:09.633 --> 01:13:13.200
If there's anything she needs.
anything at all. please let know.

1105
01:13:13.967 --> 01:13:16.333
Of course. Yeah.

1106
01:13:16.867 --> 01:13:18.333
Yeah...
