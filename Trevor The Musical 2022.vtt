00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:23.962
[Trevor] It's not fair.

164
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.132
Why is Mrs. Kerr in charge
of putting together the talent show?

165
00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.300
She can't even put together an outfit.

166
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:30.885
You know?

167
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.013
I like what Mrs. Kerr wears.

168
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.598
Especially that green dress
with the loose button.

169
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.059
Okay.

170
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.104
Would you just look at this already?

171
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.942
It looks like tadpoles.

172
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.235
Here. Your turn.

173
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.946
But we already observed yours.

174
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.740
It's a scientific experiment.

175
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.783
You can't learn anything
from just one specimen.

176
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.076
You're the second variable.

177
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.453
What are we learning again?

178
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.998
I'm working on a hypothesis
that mine are abnormally strong.

179
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.250
Like top-10% strong.

180
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.253
But given that I have limited data.

181
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.673
my adjusted hypothesis is that mine
are just way stronger than yours.

182
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.175
-No. they're not.
-Prove it.

183
00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.178
Is it true it can make me go deaf?

184
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.262
No.

185
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.431

Look. I was very happy with my choice.

188
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.522

And I could direct it and choreograph it.

It's what the team always does.

Mom. the stuff in here

if you don't understand

401
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.312
about President Reagan being shot.

402
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.898
She's obsessed.

403
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.735
You know. they say the man that shot him.

404
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:57.238
he did it to get the attention
of an actress he was infatuated with.

405
00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.032
Jodie Foster.

406

407
00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.300
That's crazy. She can't even sing.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:20.679
Hey. Trevor. where'd you put the--

409
00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.848
-The what?
-The. uh… science magazine.

410

493
00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:14.991
That's just-- That's what Mary said.

494
00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:17.160
I didn't mean to bother you with it.

495
00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:20.413
I just thought if he said anything. then…

496
00:26:20.997 --> 00:26:21.998
Are you taking Cathy?

497
00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:23.917
Do people rehearse monologues there?

498
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:29.964
Okay. Well. Trevor. I'll see you.

499
00:26:32.884 --> 00:26:35.887
Hey. it's nice what you're doing for them.
With the talent show.

500
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.475
I saw a little of the end.
and it seems really cute.

501
00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:45.397
Cute?

502
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.108
That's what polite moms say
to delusional children.

503
00:26:48.942 --> 00:26:51.778
Diana Ross was not discovered
because someone thought she was cute!

504
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:54.322
We have to do better.

505
00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:58.284
We have to practice like no one
has ever practiced before.

506
00:26:58.368 --> 00:26:59.369
We have to be…

507
00:26:59.452 --> 00:27:00.954
♪ <i>Do it all again</i> ♪

508
00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:03.123

-Just a few things.
-[all groan]

510
00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:09.504
Todd. the ground isn't going anywhere.
Don't be afraid to pick up your feet.

511
00:27:10.422 --> 00:27:11.798
[mouthing] What?

512
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.758
Luke. bend your arm.

513
00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:16.052
Now your leg.

514
00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:19.264
See? Your joints work. Use them.

515
00:27:19.347 --> 00:27:20.557
[all laughing]

516
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.853
Jason. you're a natural.
Everyone should be watching Jason.

517
00:27:24.936 --> 00:27:27.272
-No. I'm not. No. you shouldn't.
-Oh!

518
00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:29.190
[Trevor] Look. I know it's scary.

519
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:31.943
But just remember how brave Diana Ross was

520
00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:35.321
when she abandoned her signature look
and wore almost no makeup at all.

521
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.368
On the cover of her album <i>diana</i>.

522
00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:42.579
Wait. The album is called <i>Diana</i>?

523
00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:45.290
No. it's called <i>diana</i>.
With a lowercase "d."

524
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:48.710
What?

525
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.546
I know. She's incredible.

526
00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:55.300
But we should stop for the day
in accordance with our bylaws.

527
00:27:55.383 --> 00:27:56.217
Thanks. everyone.

528
00:27:56.301 --> 00:27:58.178
-and practice. practice. practice.
-[indistinct whispers]

529
00:27:58.261 --> 00:28:00.138
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-It's a mistake.

530
00:28:00.221 --> 00:28:01.473
Oh. except Luke.

531
00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:05.226
We just need a quick minute to go over
your relationship with your cane.

532
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.311
Oh! Someone's in trouble--

533
00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:07.812
Hey. we can't tomorrow. Trevor.

534
00:28:07.896 --> 00:28:09.189
-We gotta go--
-[Jason] Pinky.

535
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:11.900
You're not gonna tell him
about the Quality Courts are you?

536
00:28:11.983 --> 00:28:15.028
Yeah. We're all supposed to go.
That's the tradition. right?

537
00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:17.572
For the team. Trevor's not one of us.

538
00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:20.367
I mean. what are we even doing?
This is nothing like <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>.

539
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:24.037
Yeah. Trevor says we can't do Travolta
with an ensemble.

540
00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:28.041
Pinky. every other team
for the last ten years

541
00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:31.086
put on those dumb tutus.
and they all survived.

542
00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:34.130
But no one's ever done… whatever this is.

543
00:28:34.214 --> 00:28:36.091
-He's weird. Pinky.
-He's fine. okay?

544
00:28:36.174 --> 00:28:37.759
Besides what are you worried about?

545
00:28:37.842 --> 00:28:39.594
-You're a natural!
-[all laughing]

546
00:28:39.678 --> 00:28:40.679
No. I'm not.

547
00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:42.555
-You're a natural.
-Stop!

548
00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.057
[football player laughing] What?

549
00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:45.809
Think about it.

550
00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:50.355
Hey. uh. Trevor.

551
00:28:51.314 --> 00:28:53.692
You wanna take a walk together?

552
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:55.402
What? Where?

553
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.611
Home.

554
00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:59.155
-Unless you have somewhere else to--
-No. I mean. yes.

555
00:28:59.239 --> 00:29:02.158
No. But. yes. I-I'll walk with you. Yes.

556
00:29:02.242 --> 00:29:04.035
'Cause. no. So. yes.

557
00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:07.205
Okay.

558
00:29:09.374 --> 00:29:11.501
I thought everyone did
a lot better today. right?

559
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:14.295
I mean. except Luke.

560
00:29:14.379 --> 00:29:17.799
My God. If he doesn't hurt himself.
it's gonna be someone else.

561
00:29:17.882 --> 00:29:19.467
Maybe we should take his cane away.

562
00:29:20.218 --> 00:29:21.845
How do you think he'd be
with a tambourine?

563
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:23.346
Trevor. Hey. do you think--

564
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.681
The tambourine was just an idea.

565
00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:27.892
-It seemed less dangerous. but I--
-No. I know. It's not that.

566
00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:30.061
It's just…

567
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:31.938
Well…

568
00:29:32.022 --> 00:29:33.815
Some of the guys.

569
00:29:33.898 --> 00:29:35.859
they're not so sure
we should do your dance.

570
00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:37.944
[Trevor] Oh.

571
00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:41.865
But my dad says anything's better
than a guy named Pinky in a pink tutu.

572
00:29:41.948 --> 00:29:43.241
But then. why did he--

573
00:29:43.324 --> 00:29:46.494
Oh. Pinky was the nickname
of some baseball player he loved.

574
00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:50.331
He was young and stupid when he had me.
That's another thing he says.

575
00:29:50.415 --> 00:29:52.667
Well. Diana Ross says.

576
00:29:53.335 --> 00:29:56.504
"Instead of looking in the past.
I put myself years ahead

577
00:29:56.588 --> 00:29:59.758
and try to look at what I need to do now
in order to get there then."

578
00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:00.842
Huh?

579
00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:06.639
She's saying you should do what you want.
not what your dad says or Jason.

580
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:10.477
Because you have to do whatever is going
to get you to your golden dream.

581
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.561
Not anyone else's.

582

It means abstinence from marriage

1383
01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:29.104

all the time.

1401
01:11:20.447 --> 01:11:23.658
Like. an older brother you never had.

1402
01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:27.037
And you write about him in your notebook

1403
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.956
because he makes you so happy
that you can't keep it inside.

1404
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.959
And you just want to be sure
it's going to be like this forever.

1405
01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:38.923
That happens with friends sometimes.

1406

Well. Trevor.
friends are people who make us happy. yes.

1409

in certain other places.

1411
01:11:55.648 --> 01:11:59.277
Because if anyone's
making you happy there.

1412
01:11:59.361 --> 01:12:01.321
well. then that's not happy like a friend.

1413
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:06.326
But. if it's anywhere else then.
well. yes. That's a friend.

01:34:25.331 --> 01:34:26.332
Sick.

1805
01:34:27.584 --> 01:34:29.002
And sore from being sick.

1806
01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:31.546
Over and over.

1807
01:34:35.592 --> 01:34:37.427
Well. it's a good thing you were though.

1808
01:34:41.306 --> 01:34:43.266
Aren't nurses supposed to be girls?

1809
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:45.143
Um. I'm a candy striper.

1810
01:34:45.685 --> 01:34:46.895
What's that?

1811
01:34:46.978 --> 01:34:48.396
Like a volunteer.

1812
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.481
And they're not girls?

1813
01:34:50.065 --> 01:34:51.066
[chuckles]

1814
01:34:51.816 --> 01:34:54.194
Some are. Some aren't.

1815
01:34:54.736 --> 01:34:55.945
There's no rule.

1816
01:34:57.822 --> 01:34:59.157
Oh. [sighs]

1817
01:34:59.949 --> 01:35:02.869
So I guess you know why I'm here then.

1818
01:35:06.164 --> 01:35:10.043
I know you took way too many aspirin
and you won't have a headache for a year.

1819
01:35:10.126 --> 01:35:11.336
I won't?

1820
01:35:12.337 --> 01:35:13.588
That's not true.

1821
01:35:15.298 --> 01:35:17.842
But I shouldn't be here. At all.

1822
01:35:18.802 --> 01:35:21.930
Trevor. Dr. Harris spoke with you. right?

1823
01:35:22.013 --> 01:35:24.307
Yes. A hundred times.

1824
01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:26.559
And he says we have to keep talking. but…

1825
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.314
Did anyone say…

1826
01:35:32.816 --> 01:35:35.402
am I going to try again. to do what I did?

1827
01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:39.072
-I think I should get the doctor--
-It doesn't matter.

1828
01:35:39.155 --> 01:35:41.366
People like me are sick
and never get better.

1829
01:35:41.449 --> 01:35:42.617
We're better off gone.

1830
01:35:46.621 --> 01:35:47.706
Who said that?

1831
01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:51.292
It's true. isn't it?

1832
01:35:52.794 --> 01:35:54.295
No. it's not.

1833
01:35:55.505 --> 01:35:56.923
But wouldn't it be easier?

1834
01:35:58.842 --> 01:35:59.843
[sighs]

1835
01:36:01.803 --> 01:36:06.224
Trevor. I know it might not seem like it
right now. but once you get out of here--

1836
01:36:06.307 --> 01:36:07.559
Everything will be the same!

1837
01:36:07.642 --> 01:36:10.437
You don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know anything.

1838
01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.730
No one does.

1839
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:13.231
[Jack sighs]

1840
01:36:14.357 --> 01:36:18.778
I know that this isn't where you wanna be.
in a hospital.

1841
01:36:24.743 --> 01:36:25.994
But I guess you're right.

1842
01:36:26.077 --> 01:36:28.788
I don't know much else besides that. so…

1843
01:36:29.914 --> 01:36:31.041
help me out.

1844
01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:34.627
Where would you rather be?

1845
01:36:34.711 --> 01:36:35.712
What?

1846
01:36:35.795 --> 01:36:39.382
When you're far away from here and old.

1847
01:36:40.383 --> 01:36:41.760
Like in ten years.

1848
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.304
Don't think. Just go.

1849
01:36:44.387 --> 01:36:45.680
Off the top of your head.

It's just that'll always be Diana Ross.

1865
01:37:39.567 --> 01:37:42.487
[chuckles] I think you mean Donna Summer.

1866
01:37:45.198 --> 01:37:46.199
I don't.

1867
01:37:46.783 --> 01:37:47.992
Oh.

1868
01:37:48.076 --> 01:37:51.121
I mean. I saw Diana in concert once.
She was good.

1869
01:37:51.204 --> 01:37:53.123
Good? She's the best.

1870
01:37:53.998 --> 01:37:55.333
Second best.

1871
01:37:55.417 --> 01:37:57.711
Okay. are you sure
you're not actually a patient here?

1872
01:37:57.794 --> 01:37:59.838
Like. for a head injury or something?

1873
01:37:59.921 --> 01:38:02.966
Are you sure you've ever heard
a Donna Summer song?

1874
01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:04.759
"Hot Stuff" is cute.

1875
01:38:05.468 --> 01:38:08.680
But Diana's work with The Supremes alone
puts Donna to shame.

1876
01:38:08.763 --> 01:38:09.764
And then there's--

1877
01:38:09.848 --> 01:38:11.057
[Jack chuckles]

1878
01:38:13.518 --> 01:38:16.688

Well. you wouldn't wanna hear
what Diana Ross had to say at her concert.

1904
01:39:59.582 --> 01:40:00.583
It's okay.

1905
01:40:01.668 --> 01:40:02.752
You can still say it.

1906
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:09.134
[chuckles]

1907
01:40:09.217 --> 01:40:11.386
-Well. she said…
-[laughs]

1908
01:40:12.887 --> 01:40:16.057
"My darlings. always remember.

1909
01:40:16.141 --> 01:40:20.020
no matter how difficult
it may seem at the time.

1910
01:40:21.771 --> 01:40:25.233
it's always easier to live the truth
than live a lie.

1911
01:40:26.818 --> 01:40:30.572
[Diana's voice] So be true
because I'll love you no matter what.

1912
01:40:31.156 --> 01:40:32.991
but I love you happy most of all."

1913
01:40:36.244 --> 01:40:37.328
She didn't say that.

1914
01:40:39.372 --> 01:40:42.584
Uh. it's just my friend told me
everything she ever said.

1915
01:40:42.667 --> 01:40:45.170
Well. okay.
Well. it wasn't anything famous.

1916
01:40:45.253 --> 01:40:48.214
just something she said

1917
01:40:49.215 --> 01:40:53.303
at her concert that I saw.

1918
01:40:53.386 --> 01:40:56.639
Really? Do you have a pen
or something I can write that down with?

1919
01:40:56.723 --> 01:40:59.059
-Just for--
-For your friend?

1920
01:40:59.142 --> 01:41:00.143
Knock. knock.

1921
01:41:00.226 --> 01:41:01.978
Oh. Is it okay if…

1922
01:41:02.062 --> 01:41:03.063
Mm-hmm.

1923
01:41:04.064 --> 01:41:06.024
You look a little less pale. bud.

1924
01:41:08.276 --> 01:41:09.944
-Oh. honey. I am so--
-Mom.

1925
01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:12.739
Not now.

1926
01:41:13.531 --> 01:41:14.532
Oh.

1927
01:41:15.283 --> 01:41:16.409
Well…

1928
01:41:17.619 --> 01:41:18.953
It's time to go. dear.

1929
01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:20.622
Back…

1930
01:41:21.414 --> 01:41:23.041
home. and. um…

1931
01:41:24.376 --> 01:41:26.002
I just wanted to say…

1932
01:41:26.711 --> 01:41:27.712
Uh…

1933
01:41:29.464 --> 01:41:31.841
They say the president is going
to make a full recovery

1934
01:41:31.925 --> 01:41:34.594
and should be back
in the White House by next week.

1935
01:41:35.762 --> 01:41:39.057
So. I just wanted you to know

1936
01:41:40.308 --> 01:41:43.269
how much I admire that kind of courage.

1937
01:41:44.354 --> 01:41:45.355
Okay?

1938
01:41:46.773 --> 01:41:47.774
Okay.

1939
01:41:49.025 --> 01:41:50.110
And. hey…

1940
01:41:52.612 --> 01:41:56.157
that bag of posters is
still in the garage.

1941
01:41:56.825 --> 01:42:01.579
And. well. it may take a while
for the wrinkles to go away.

1942
01:42:01.663 --> 01:42:05.959
but over time. you know?

1943
01:42:09.254 --> 01:42:11.047
So. you get dressed.

1944
01:42:11.548 --> 01:42:14.634
and we'll bring the car around
and get you back home.

1945
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:17.971
Okay.

1946
01:42:28.398 --> 01:42:30.025
Sorry. They're really--

1947
01:42:30.108 --> 01:42:31.192
Trying.

1948
01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.032
They're really trying.

1949
01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:40.785
Yeah. I guess.

1950
01:42:41.619 --> 01:42:43.204

1951
01:42:43.997 --> 01:42:45.331

01:42:45.415 --> 01:42:46.458
