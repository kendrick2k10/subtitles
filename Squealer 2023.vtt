3
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.484
No!

4
00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.221
Christ. Helen.

5
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.974
How many times
do I have to tell you
to take it easy on the brakes?

6
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.434
She came from nowhere.

7
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:05.435
What was it?

8
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:06.895
It was a naked woman.

9
00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.521
I said you should drive.

10
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.440
- Oh. you didn't--
- I told you she's underneath.

11
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.692
You didn't say that.

12
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.818
Here. hold Molly.

13
00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.993
Christ. Bring a blanket.

14
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.833
- Alright.
- Is she dead?

15
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.376
No.
But if we don't get her

16
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.794
to the hospital right now.
she will be.

17
00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.671
We gotta get her in the van.
Come on.

18
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.315
Come on. let's get her in.
She's lost a lot of blood.

19
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.304
Alright. what have we got?

20
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.056
- I can't find a vein.
- Sheesh.

21
00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.684
All these needle marks.
all these veins are flat.

22
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:28.977
Ah. shit.

23
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.146
I really don't wanna have
to do a carotid.

24
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.856
There's nothing.

25
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.193
Do it.

26
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.620
It's okay.

27
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.289
Okay. hold her down.

28
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.541
Hold her down. hold her down.

29
00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.418
- It's okay.
- He's coming!

30
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.336
- Sweetie...
- Nobody's coming. No.

31
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.171
No. no. no. no. no. no.
What's your name?

32
00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.215
- Oh. he's coming!
- It's okay. It's okay.

33
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.760
You're alright.
you're gonna be okay.

34
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.514
What other drugs
have you taken?

35
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.769
Oh. lord... Alright.

36
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.316
Let's keep her sedated
and let's get a look
at these lacerations.

37
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.651
Looks like she's gone
through a meat grinder.

38
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.988
Draw some blood
and get it back to me
as quick as possible.

39
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:38.546
Nice ass. Give me
a grab. will you?

40
00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.340
Fuck off!

41
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.766
- Hey!
- I really admire

42
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.851
- them bodacious jugs.
- Go find

43
00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.561
- some fucking other ones.
- Hey. punk!

44
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.188
You feeling lucky? Are ya?

45
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.522
Go ahead.
touch her again.

46
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.899
- Do it.
- Wha--?

47
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.817
Damn. Lisa. what's gotten
into you?

48
00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.361
Yeah. what kind of hooker
are you anyway. lady?

49
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:02.820
Not one you can afford.

50
00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.073
Hey. hey. back off. Come on.

51
00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:06.199
Do you see what I deal with?

52
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.492
Oh. come on.

53
00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.868
just a little titty.

54
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.620
I got money.

55
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.663
How much
will ten bucks get me?

56
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.583
You can get fucked.
but not by us.

57
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.877
Oh!

58
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.004
- How do you deal
with that all the time?
- Take me to Titty Town!

59
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.714
- Okay.
-  - Come on. pull those girls out.

60
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.299
- Sadie. Hey. hey. hey!
- Ow!

61
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.550
- No. no. no.
Come here. Come here.
- Ahh!

62
00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.552
Hey. hey. hey. come.
come. come. Come on.

63
00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.597
Every fucking time.

64
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:36.479
It was just off a country road
near some tracks. I think.

65
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.775
How fast were you going?

66
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.652
Well. I was going
the speed limit.

67
00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:44.862
Why was she driving?
Were you drinking?

68
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.573
- No. Just--
- Okay. was she drinking?

69
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.908
No.

70
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.284
So what meds are you on?

71
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.120
- What?
- Excuse me?

72
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.455
Oh. honey.

73
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:58.167
I think I have some concealer
in here that'll help with that.

74
00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.710
Yeah. right.

75
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.587
Oh. what about
a smoke instead?

76
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.673
- Oh. yeah. here.
- Ugh.

77
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.845
Actually...

78
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.847
take the whole pack.

79
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:12.932
Really?

80
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.308
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

81
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:16.853
Yeah.

82
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.856
No time like the present.

83
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.906
Hey. have you thought
about my offer?

84
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.200
I can see you tomorrow.

85
00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.455
I don't know. I...

86
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.708
I wouldn't even have
anything proper to wear.

87
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.710
Mm. You're about my size.

88
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.504
Why don't you stop by
my place tomorrow
and you can borrow something?

89
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.214
You're not gonna make me wear
something like this. are you?

90
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.925
No. actually.
I have something perfect.

91
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.928
And then if you get the job.
it'll fit you for a uniform.

92
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.597
Uniform?

93
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.557
God. Lisa.

94
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.185
The only uniform I've ever worn
is an orange jumpsuit.

95
00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.270
Hey. opportunities like this.

96
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.897
they don't come around
every day.

97
00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:03.024
I know you don't wanna be
walking the streets like this

98
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:04.609
when you're 50.

99
00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.029
Lucky if I make it to 35.

100
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.993
- Ugh.
- Here comes the party pooper.

101
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.578
- Hmm.
- Uh...

102
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.164
I-I really don't know.
I mean. it happened so fast.

103
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.416
- We're not from around here.
- And she came out of nowhere.

104
00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:32.094
Evening. ladies.

105
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.724
Sadie. what happened here?

106
00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:38.684
Nothing.

107
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.269
One day. it's not
gonna be nothing.

108
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.771
There's some bad dudes
out there.

109
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:43.105
I hate to see you get hurt.

110
00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:44.857
Thank you.

111
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.693
You. You know the drill.
Get in the back.

112
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.237
Seriously?

113
00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.155
Don't make me
get out of this car.

114
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.159
Ah...

115
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:59.121
- You don't have anything sharp?
- Are you kidding me right now?

116
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.666
You are kidding me. right?

117
00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.292
- With anything back here?
- Hey! Hey!

118
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.336
- Hey. you do that again...
- Watch your hands.

119
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.879
...and I'm gonna throw
the cuffs on you.

120
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.839
- Oh. my God. Ouch!
- Watch your head.

121
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.091
Hey. Officer Jack.

122
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.718
Want some extra company?

123
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.387
We're offering
a two-for-one
special tonight.

124
00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:17.098
Ah. this one's
all I can handle.
thank you.

125
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:18.933
Your loss.

126
00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:38.077
Will you let me
out of this car right now?

127
00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.663
If you give me
a kiss. I will.

128
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.498
How about I give you
a punch in the mouth?

129
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:48.671
- Oh. Oh. you're so not funny.
- I'm hilarious.

130
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.464
Oh. I'm glad
you think you are.

131
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.258
Everyone else thinks
you're a bore.

132
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.302
You mind telling me
what you're doing out here

133
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.928
dressed as a mariachi woman?

134
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.805
It's my hooker look.

135
00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:01.267
You think dudes wanna
hook up with women
that are dressed as mariachis?

136
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.560
It's not--

137
00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.812
It's not mariachi. I--

138
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.772
I came to talk to Sadie
and try to get her to go

139
00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:08.190
to that interview for tomorrow.

140
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.402
I still don't get it.

141
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.362
I feel like
I'm more relatable
to the girls

142
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:16.324
if I don't look like
a soccer mom.

143
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.745
No!

144
00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:26.292
Please. no.

145
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.210
Now you just keep
an eye on her.

146
00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:31.839
Please...

147
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.926
I think soccer mom's hot.

148
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.554
So. how about that kiss?

149
00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.931
Oh. pfft. You got
a one-track mind.

150
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.226
Well. goddamn. Lisa.
it's been two months.

151
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.520
Speaking of which.

152
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.939
you coming back home or not?

153
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.858
Mmm.

154
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.444
That's it?

155
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.446
You're not gonna say anything?

156
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.907
Normally. I can't
get you to shut up.

157
00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.867
And...
Now you're going
all silent on me?

158
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.869
Oh. whoa. okay.

159
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.954
Well. oh. now I'm really not
gonna say anything.

160
00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.915
I'll just sit back here
with my mouth shut.

161
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:07.416
I'm not gonna say a word.

162
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.252
Nothing. nada. zip.

163
00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:12.129
Won't even say anything
about your hair.

164
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.131
What the fuck about my hair?

165
00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.092
Is that Just For Men?

166
00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.760
No. but my--

167
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.428
I mean. I did a little. but...

168
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.430
Shut up.

169
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.101
Shoot. I gotta go. That's Joe.

170
00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:27.311
- Gotta get to work.
- Absolute nonsense.

171
00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.230
Hey. let me out.

172
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.774
- I'm serious.
- Alright.

173
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.984
I gotta go. Thank you.

174
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.905
Looks like it did when I was 20.

175
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.491
Okay. let's not make
this difficult.

176
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.661
Just put one foot
in front of the other
and walk the line.

177
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.414
Alright. just do
what he says. Helen.
Let's get this done with.

178
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.916
Jesus Christ.

179
00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.842
She's a lost cause.

180
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:02.596
Sadly. I see these type
of situations every time
I'm out here.

181
00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:03.889
Shame on you.

182
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.766
She's somebody's daughter.

183
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.643
Well. I'm sure
she used to be.

184
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.785
Hey. thanks for coming.
We brought her in.

185
00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.954
She's had multiple lacerations.

186
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.790
She's high
as a kite. with no ID.

187
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.334
and had this real
acrid smell to her.

188
00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:33.586
And she's. uh...

189
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.589
- She's really freaked out.
- Okay.

190
00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.426
- Doing some role-playing
or what?

191
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.345
Well. uh. kind of.
Helps to fit in
when you look the part.

192
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.392
Oh. shit. Oh.

193
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.355
Oh. it's...

194
00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:03.199
Hi. It's okay.

195
00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:04.909
You're okay.

196
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.954
My name's Lisa.
I'm with Social Services.

197
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:11.248
I'm not gonna hurt you. okay?
I'm here to help you.

198
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.708
Can you tell me your name?

199
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.379
It's okay. How about...
Can you just nod
your head for me?

200
00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:20.382
You know... Do you know
who did this to you?

201
00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:23.260
No. no. no. it's okay.
Shh. shh. shh.

202
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.888
You are so safe here.
You can trust me. okay?

203
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.599
Take my hand. We're gonna
come out nice and slow.

204
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.851
Gotta get you back
into bed. okay?

205
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.437
You're okay. You're safe.
Let's go. nice and easy.

206
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.065
- Nice and easy. It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

207
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.776
You're safe.
You're safe. You're fine.

208
00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:45.407
- Oh. my God!
- Somebody sound Code One!

209
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.835
No.

210
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.565
Oh. Jesus Christ.

211
00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.567
Come on. You don't have
to see this.

212
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.235
- Oh. my God.
- You don't have
to see this. Don't look.

213
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:22.945
Just don't look. Come on.

214
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.947
Come on.

215
00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.449
Come on.

216
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.741
Wait. what?

217
00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:10.784
- Right?
- What a nice surprise.

218
00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:13.454
I was wondering
if there was
any information

219
00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:14.872
on last night's stabbing.

220
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.498
- Uh. we're on it.
- Lisa.

221
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.500
Chief. hi.

222
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.004
Ray of sunshine
in our dingy little office.

223
00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.672
Anything on that girl
last night?

224
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.467
Street rat.
clearly drugged up.

225
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.594
gets killed
by traffic accident.

226
00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.512
With multiple knife wounds?

227
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.557
Lisa.

228
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.185
We're on it. Let us do our jobs.

229
00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.519
Did you know her?

230
00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:39.980
Yeah. she had
a familiar face. but. uh...

231
00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:43.943
I don't know. These. uh.
these girls are kind of
tough nuts to crack.

232
00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:46.612
Maybe I'll go over
to Star's tonight.
I can ask around.

233
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.530
Don't go nuts.
You're drawing me. Lisa.

234
00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:50.157
A single vehicle incident

235
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.160
involving an unidentified
female pedestrian

236
00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:56.455
resulted in a tragic
and horrific accident
late last night.

237
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.962
Oh. my God. you look amazing.

238
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.838
Ugh. what if they don't like me?

239
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.924
- I don't want you
to be disappointed.
- No. no. shh. shh. stop.

240
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.176
Don't be nervous. okay?
These are friends of mine.

241
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.971
You just go in there.
just be yourself.
That's all you have to do.

242
00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:14.223
- You got it.
- Okay. Okay.

243
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.309
Okay. but what if
they do like me?
I mean. Lisa.

244
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.103
- I don't know.
- Hey. I already told you.

245
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.813
Don't worry about anything.
You can stay with me

246
00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.231
until you get
your first paycheck.

247
00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:23.482
Okay?

248
00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:24.900
Nothing to be nervous about.

249
00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.235
Go knock 'em dead.

250
00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:27.903
Yes.

251
00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.114
Thank you.

252
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.742
- Good luck.
- If anyone has any information

253
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:37.913
on her identity. please call
the police department
at 555-71...

254
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.263
- Hey. Jack.
- Hey.

255
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.557
So you're working late again?

256
00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:58.976
Yeah. I got
a lot of paperwork.

257
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.978
Is there anything
I can help you with?

258
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.646
Nah. It's all in my head.

259
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.732
I just got to get it out
on the computer.

260
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.817
I can help you clear
your head.

261
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.403
I heard you guys split.

262
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:11.739
She must have been crazy

263
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.033
to let a good man
like you get away.

264
00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:16.326
Not exactly. We. uh...

265
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:18.037
We're trying to work it out.

266
00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:19.413
Hmm.

267
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:21.957
Well. if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on...

268
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:24.877
Thank you. Silvia.

269
00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:27.588
That shoulder
could be in uniform.

270
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.883
Or it could be
in absolutely nothing...

271
00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.426
...but Chanel No. 5.

272
00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.806
Well. that is certainly
an intoxicating offer.

273
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.267
but I'm not ready--
Oh. oh. oh. no.

274
00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.313
I'm not ready to give up
on her just yet.

275
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.276
Okay. Well...

276
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.112
if you change your mind...

277
00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:55.115
offer still stands.

278
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:02.664
It's not the only thing
standing.

279
00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:27.523
Hey. girls.

280
00:18:27.564 --> 00:18:29.525
- Hey.
- Hi. Lisa.

281
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.444
We heard about that girl
that got sliced up and run down.

282
00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.905
- Fucking terrifying.
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.281
What's your old man's
take on it?

284
00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:38.033
- Yeah?
- I'm getting the blow off.

285
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:39.368
Did any of you girls know her?

286
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:40.869
She wasn't one of us.

287
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.372
Must have rolled in
from some other gutter.

288
00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.499
- Unlucky gutter.
- What's it gonna be. ladies?

289
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.627
If you're sitting at my table.
you gotta crack open
those coin purses.

290
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.337
- Star!
- Come on. Star!

291
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.840
Hey. lay off. Star.
You know that we keep
this place running.

292
00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:54.258
- Uh-huh.
- Amen!

293
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:55.843
Hey. it's alright. Star.
This round's on me.

294
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.052
Whatever they normally get.

295
00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:00.097
Yay! Lisa!

296
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.640
What they always get
when you're paying.

297
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.475
or what they sometimes get
when you're not here?

298
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.185
Come on!

299
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.562
What they usually get.

300
00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:07.688
How about for you?

301
00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:09.106
I heard you had
a hell of a night.

302
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.983
How about a double?

303
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.777
- Damn. Star!
What's wrong with you?
- Seriously?

304
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.612
- For real?
- Oh!

305
00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.490
Sorry. Lisa. I run a bar. Habit.

306
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.075
No. no. no sweat.

307
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.703
So. anything on the girl?

308
00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.248
Come on. any of you guys
see her last night?

309
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.250
Know where she might
have gotten picked up?

310
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.626
Who she partied with?

311
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.174
Nothing? Come on. girls.

312
00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:37.384
I know you're not always
on the up and up with me.

313
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.552
and I get it.

314
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.929
I'm not here to cause
any trouble.

315
00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.599
Or bore us
with your AA antidotes.

316
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.434
- Shawanda!
- Fair enough. Alright. fine.

317
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:47.394
I just wanted to find
out what happened

318
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.563
so it doesn't happen again
to any of you.

319
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.689
You see?

320
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.567
So. anything?

321
00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.031
Hey. how about you?

322
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.534
You know anything
about that girl
that got killed last night?

323
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:03.660
Me?

324
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.585
That one? Fucking nutcase.

325
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.545
I wouldn't believe a word
that comes out of her mouth.

326
00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:14.838
She's a tweaker.

327
00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.561
Welcome. Hell. yeah.

328
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.752
Hi. How are you?

329
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:55.170
Listen. girl.

330
00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.922
We appreciate your concern.

331
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.049
but she's not the first

332
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.426
- and she won't be the last.
- Mm?

333
00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:03.428
Girls have been
disappearing around here

334
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.722
- for years.
- Yep.

335
00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.809
And nobody gives a damn.

336
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.937
Are you telling me
that other girls
have been killed?

337
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.480
We have been talking
to the cops

338
00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.274
- till we're blue in the face.
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:18.568
- They don't care.
- All we get at best is a shrug.

340
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.447
Listen. they don't give
a shit about us.
They think we got it coming

341
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.699
- or something.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.548
Oh. hell. yeah. man.

343
00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:24.968
You got more of this?
I'm your girl.

344
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.607
Whatever you want. Daddy.

345
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.109
That's my game.

346
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.196
"Anything Kate." they call me.

347
00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.992
Could you move over
just a little bit. please?

348
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.702
What the fuck?

349
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.497
I said I would do
whatever you want.

350
00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.956
You just gotta ask.

351
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.714
Sorry. I'm a little bit
of a clean freak.

352
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:05.759
Clean freak.

353
00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:07.969
That's funny.

354
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.819
You're a funny...

355
00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.072
funny fucking guy.
You know that?

356
00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:31.493
Fuckin' serious?
You're fuckin' nuts.

357
00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:35.080
Oh. my pretty
little piggy.

358
00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:37.332
I'm dead serious.

359
00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.377
Shit.

360
00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:46.550
This stuff's good.

361
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.429
It's good.

362
00:23:56.893 --> 00:23:58.228
What the fuck are you doing?

363
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.105
What?

364
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.773
W-what-- what's the fucking
knife in your hand?

365
00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.567
- What knife?
- Fucking knife.

366
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.696
Darling. this isn't a knife.

367
00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:09.072
This is your salvation.

368
00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.491
No. no. no. no. no. no.
No. no. please.

369
00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:12.909
Please. look-- I'll get you off.

370
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.995
Let me do anything.
Stop. please.

371
00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.081
You already have.

372
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.913
Thank you.

373
00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:07.732
Okay.

374
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.695
We got 50 links...

375
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:13.822
forty pork...

376
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:17.659
two Squealer's specials.

377
00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:22.289
Fresh killer sausages.

378
00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:26.543
This place never disappoints.

379
00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:33.925
Thank you.

380
00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:38.722
You know. it's all in the cut.

381
00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.281
Women get reported
missing all the time

382
00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:58.074
and most of them
turn out to be nothing.

383
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:01.661
These girls on the street.
they're mostly just drifters.

384
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.788
Well. that doesn't mean
that we should just ignore them.

385
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.459
We need to put
our energy into people
who really deserve it. Lisa.

386
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.169
Not people who choose

387
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.046
a certain way of life
and then end up dead
in a ditch...

388
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:12.547
- "Choose a way of life..."
- ...because of their
life choices.

389
00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:13.673
- Oh. shit.
-  - Not people who choose...

390
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:14.883
I'm sorry but that's
the harsh truth.

391
00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:17.218
That is not only heartless.

392
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.429
It's incredibly ignorant.
What. seriously?

393
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.765
You think these women
on-on school career day decided.

394
00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:25.185
"Hey. I just think
I'll be a cheap hooker
and stand on a street corner

395
00:27:25.226 --> 00:27:27.103
where somebody might come along
and kill me."

396
00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.773
- Lisa--
- And if they do.
no one will give a damn.

397
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.149
not even the police.

398
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:34.736
Lisa. calm down. Goddamn you.

399
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:36.613
Come on. man.

400
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:39.658
Do-- Please tell me
that you don't agree with her.

401
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:42.077
Is that why you
haven't done enough
to find this poor girl?

402
00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:44.245
Lisa. I know
that this is personal for you.

403
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.623
but we don't have the manpower
on the force.

404
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.792
and we're all just trying
to do our best.

405
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.377
Really?

406
00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:53.380
Well. in the words
of Winston Churchill.

407
00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:55.548
"It is not enough
that we do our best.

408
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.843
Sometimes we have to do
what is fucking required."

409
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:15.985
That language is a little blunt.
even for Churchill.

410
00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.570
Alright. well.
so I embellished.

411
00:28:17.612 --> 00:28:18.947
Yeah. you did.

412
00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:21.741
There's no need
to take it out on Silvia.

413
00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:22.992
She didn't do anything.

414
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:26.413
Right. She didn't do anything.

415
00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:27.789
That's the problem.

416
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.791
None of you
are doing anything.

417
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:30.834
Lisa.

418
00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.961
is this what you do? You...

419
00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:38.550
Uh. we have an APB out

420
00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:42.137
on two pink puppies
trying to escape. Do you copy?

421
00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:44.055
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

422
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.641
Wanna say it a little louder
for the guys in the back?

423
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:47.976
Go ahead.

424
00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:49.018
See.

425
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:52.021
my mama told me
about your type.

426
00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.273
And what'd she say?

427
00:28:53.314 --> 00:28:55.692
You do whatever it takes
to get attention.

428
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.652
And when you get
the attention you want.

429
00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:00.113
"What are you doing?
What are you--?" Like. come on.

430
00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.490
You see what you're doing
wearing this shit every day.

431
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.993
I'm giving you
what you want. attention.

432
00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:07.871
Did your mama also ever tell you
that you got a big fucking mouth

433
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.581
that should stay shut?

434
00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:11.207
'Cause let me tell you
something right now.

435
00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:14.294
You ever speak to me
or even about me again.

436
00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:17.380
I will rip your pathetic
little man-child nuts off

437
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.799
and shove them
down your throat.

438
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:21.176
You got it?

439
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.137
All good.

440
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:27.140
I got this killer sausage
here too.

441
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:29.726
It's all for me.

442
00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:36.292
Oh. shit. No. no. no. no. no.

443
00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.479
It's so beautiful.

444
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.814
You hear the music?

445
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:58.982
- Do you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:31:39.939 --> 00:31:41.190
Mind if I come in?

447
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:44.277
Oh. you must have read my mind.

448
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.778
Need something
to wake me up

449
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.864
from this episode
of The Twilight Zone.

450
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:50.909
Yeah. well. glad to see
there's one vice

451
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.660
- that you haven't given up.
- Hmm.

452
00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:54.829
Besides. who else can I call

453
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.457
at three in the morning
when I can't sleep?

454
00:31:57.498 --> 00:31:58.708
This is insane.

455
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.877
There's literally dozens
of missing women

456
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:03.671
and zero action
from the Dickless Tracys.

457
00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:05.006
Are you alright?

458
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.801
I haven't seen you this wound up
since. uh. you know.

459
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:11.721
I'm fine.

460
00:32:13.473 --> 00:32:15.600
When's the last time
you talked to your sponsor?

461
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:18.353
Hey. I said I'm fine.

462
00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:25.693
Lisa. I know you care
about these girls.
but you gotta see Jack's point.

463
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:29.656
A lot of them are transient.
and they don't wanna be found.

464
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:31.908
I know the stats.
Joe. I'm just...

465
00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:34.827
telling you something
does not feel right.

466
00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:36.287
You saw a woman die.

467
00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:37.956
that's what doesn't feel right.

468
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:42.627
Seeing something like that
could mess with anybody

469
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:44.170
as sensitive as you.

470
00:32:45.713 --> 00:32:46.881
Yeah.

471
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:49.717
You're probably right.

472
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:51.469
Yeah.

473
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.014
I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking

474
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.016
about that crazy girl
with the red hair.

475
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.352
'Cause you're swimming
on this pretty deep water here.

476
00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:01.062
Why don't you let
Jack handle this?

477
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.689
It's 'cause it's like
he's brainwashed.

478
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.775
What if there really is
someone out there killing

479
00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:08.361
not just one woman.
but lots of them.

480
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:12.657
Okay. okay. what you got here
is a serial killer. hmm?

481
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:15.451
A female serial killer
with red hair.

482
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.081
Girl that died was a drug addict
and a hooker.

483
00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:25.086
And her end. God rest her soul.
is no big surprise.

484
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:28.756
The wounds she suffered
were unlikely related

485
00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:30.216
to the other missing women.

486
00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:31.718
Maybe.

487
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.929
Maybe not.
I just have a feeling.

488
00:33:36.472 --> 00:33:37.890
I've got a feeling too.

489
00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.394
but not a good one.

490
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.273
Oh. uh...

491
00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:48.776
By the way. that acrid smell
I was telling you about?

492
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:49.819
Mm-hmm.

493
00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:51.904
It's a farm smell.

494
00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:53.281
You know what's
really interesting?

495
00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:54.782
That couple that found her said

496
00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:56.951
that they were on the west side
of the city.

497
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.327
That's farm country.

498
00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:01.873
You know. there's a lot
of farms out there.

499
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:03.916
But you. you stay
the hell away from there.

500
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.710
There's a lot
of weird people out there.

501
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:06.753
Mm-hmm.

502
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:10.590
I should know it.
I treat them every damn day.

503
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.216
See you later. pumpkin.

504
00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:14.719
Bye.

505
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.885
Sugar?

506
00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.305
It's. uh. for all my friends.

507
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:03.893
Hmm. And I put
some extra in for you.

508
00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:06.479
- Extra?
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:08.731
What for?

510
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:11.818
I need you to dump
some trash for me.

511
00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:25.706
- Oh. wow.
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:35:25.748 --> 00:35:26.874
Oh.

513
00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:30.002
That is a big son of a bitch.

514
00:35:32.004 --> 00:35:33.297
Goodness gracious.

515
00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:35.550
What happened to him?

516
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.135
You know.

517
00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:40.930
Fat guys. Their hearts give.

518
00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:43.891
Yeah.

519
00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:46.561
- Gotta imagine
this didn't help.
- Mm.

520
00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:49.730
Give me a sec.

521
00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:20.428
Okay... let's figure
this out here.

522
00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:47.872
Hey. buddy. could you give me--
give me a hand?

523
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.542
Ah. you can have the whole body.

524
00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:59.383
You said "give me a hand."
You get it?

525
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:01.552
No.

526
00:37:03.095 --> 00:37:05.306
Okay.

527
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.895
Oh. come on.

528
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.774
Okay. okay.

529
00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:24.450
What the hell happened
to his shoe?

530
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:25.660
He bled all over it.

531
00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:29.497
Bled all over his shoe?

532
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:31.832
How?

533
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:35.586
I used it to slap
his fat face.

534
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:40.675
You slapped this man in the face
with his shoe? Why?

535
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:44.262
What--? What is this?
Twenty fucking questions?

536
00:37:44.303 --> 00:37:46.764
Yes. I used his shoe
to slap him

537
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:48.182
in his fat fucking face.

538
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:49.433
What does it matter?
What else was I gonna use?

539
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:53.062
Well. you'd use a mallet.
You'd use a baseball bat.

540
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.522
Maybe...

541
00:37:54.563 --> 00:37:56.357
A meat tenderizer. I don't know.

542
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.236
A meat-- a meat tenderizer?

543
00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:05.491
Where am I going to get
a meat tenderizer. hm?

544
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.749
Meat tenderizer.

545
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:17.670
Right this way. Daniel.

546
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.105
Okay.

547
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.441
Oof.

548
00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:40.860
Oh.

549
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:44.196
I thought these places
were. um...

550
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:46.240
Oh.

551
00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.492
I thought these places
were supposed to be.
um...

552
00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:50.745
...sterile. like hospitals.

553
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.000
If the place is too clean.

554
00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:58.961
the meat don't taste as good.

555
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.421
Too clean?

556
00:39:01.213 --> 00:39:02.673
Fuck me.

557
00:39:02.715 --> 00:39:04.633
I feel like I need
a tetanus shot in my face.

558
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.721
Mm.

559
00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:09.990
You want the blood
to bleed out real nice.

560
00:40:10.866 --> 00:40:14.078
The femoral artery
will bleed you dry in no time.

561
00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:17.790
You know. this might
take some time.

562
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.458
If you want.

563
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:22.753
I could brew us up
a pot of coffee

564
00:40:22.795 --> 00:40:26.132
and maybe fry us up
some sausage sandwiches.

565
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.886
I'm good. I'm super good.

566
00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:32.221
Thank you. Uh...

567
00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:35.516
I'm gonna be outside. Alright?

568
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.937
Suit yourself.

569
00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:02.334
Oh. shit. Um.
I'm gonna be on my way.

570
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:03.836
Hey. Tammy.
I need to ask you
a few questions.

571
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:05.296
I'm not working.
I was just cruising by.

572
00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:06.922
- saying hi to some friends.
- Come here.

573
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:10.551
I'm not here
to give you a hard time.

574
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.011
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

575
00:41:15.097 --> 00:41:16.390
Get over here.

576
00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:31.113
- What's up?
- Did you know that poor girl

577
00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.448
that got hit by the truck?

578
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.116
Personally?

579
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:36.285
No. I've seen her
around. though.

580
00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:39.371
Did you hear any stories
about anybody unusual

581
00:41:39.413 --> 00:41:41.415
coming around with her
or any other other girls?

582
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:44.335
No one new.

583
00:41:45.127 --> 00:41:46.837
You didn't hear anything
from the other girls.

584
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:49.173
some of the people
you work with. anything?

585
00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:51.550
No. Can I go home now?

586
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.595
Okay. Alright. thank you.

587
00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:08.192
All done?

588
00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:12.530
We're good.

589
00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:16.951
You know...

590
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.870
if you cleaned
yourself up. you know.

591
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:22.498
you know. shaved your beard.
you know. put on some cologne.

592
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.626
maybe got some new
threads. right?
A nice whip. nice ride.

593
00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:28.754
You can have some fine
classy ass coming in
and out of here all day. right?

594
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:30.089
Fuck knows you can afford it.

595
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.007
You got more money
than God. huh?

596
00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.342
This land alone's got
to be worth what?

597
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.636
Millions. Millions.

598
00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:38.389
I don't work alone.

599
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.683
Oh. yeah. I'm well aware.

600
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:44.645
I heard you got.
uh. seven million
for your uncle's spot.

601
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:48.774
- That's not true.
- Whatever.

602
00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:50.401
It's irrelevant. right?

603
00:42:50.442 --> 00:42:51.860
Whatever money you have.

604
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:54.405
you can get a fucking tail train
coming through here.

605
00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:56.448
It was eight and a half million.

606
00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.618
Eight and a half
million dollars?

607
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.829
- That's right.
- And you still live here?

608
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:04.707
Well. this is my home.

609
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.217
What the fuck was that?

610
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:18.095
It's feeding time.

611
00:43:23.225 --> 00:43:24.310
Come see.

612
00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.529
- Come on.
- Oh. what the fuck is this?

613
00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:38.324
- Come on.
- It's wind.

614
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.160
- I know what it is.
- Here you go.

615
00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:44.622
Come on.

616
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.793
I know. I know. I know.
Here you go. here you go.

617
00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:53.922
Come on.

618
00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:05.142
- What are you
feeding them? Meat?
- Come here. Oh. no.

619
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.561
These babies...

620
00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:09.688
...they'll eat anything.

621
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.318
So don't ever stick
your hand or your foot...

622
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.488
or that tiny dick of yours

623
00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:19.365
through that fence here.
'cause if you do...

624
00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:26.538
...guaranteed they're
gonna eat your ass.

625
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.207
Maybe I should feed you to them.

626
00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:29.541
Oh. yeah. you promise?

627
00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:37.216
Is that a fucking hand?

628
00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:39.760
Hey. Squee. um...

629
00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:42.096
There was some
Lisa bitch at Star's

630
00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.723
and she's asking
just a lot of questions.

631
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.100
Who the fuck is Lisa?

632
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.267
I don't know
who the fuck Lisa is.

633
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:48.602
You tell me who Lisa is.

634
00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:50.979
Did I miss something?

635
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.696
Yeah. mind your fucking
business. eggplant.

636
00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:02.700
Did you bring that blow
you promised me last time?

637
00:45:02.741 --> 00:45:04.326
Do I look like
I'm running a charity?

638
00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.078
Well. you know
I'll work for it. right?

639
00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.330
In your dreams.

640
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.874
Yeah? You wanna walk
into the sunset with me?

641
00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:12.793
My dreams are this way. Come on.

642
00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:25.806
- Get away from that. Get away.
- What?

643
00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.683
Don't touch that. Okay?

644
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:32.020
- It's deadly.
- That thing will kill you?

645
00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:34.690
Just leave it alone.

646
00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:38.610
Huh. Do you have
a little Indian outfit

647
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.696
you like to dress it up in
for Christmas?

648
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:46.076
This is the highest-powered.
carbon-fiber

649
00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:48.954
compound bow
on the planet.

650
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.251
I do like it
when you talk dirty to me.

651
00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:56.336
- Oh. yeah?
- Oh. yeah.

652
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.640
Hey. Paul.
you got a sec?

653
00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:11.602
- What up?
- When you get a chance.

654
00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:13.061
I'd like to take a look
at that report

655
00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.605
you took from the couple
in the RV.

656
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:17.065
- For what?
- I just wanna

657
00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:18.692
comb through and see
if we missed anything.

658
00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:22.154
I see what you're doing.

659
00:46:23.155 --> 00:46:25.240
You're trying to get back
with your ex. ain't you?

660
00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:30.746
I understand. man.
She got a nice.
tight little booty.

661
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:31.872
What the fuck did you say to me?

662
00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:35.375
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
- What are you doing. Jack?

663
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:37.753
You know he's not worth it.

664
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:50.516
She's married to a cop
so don't go fucking with her.

665
00:46:51.183 --> 00:46:53.101
Oh. come on. Star.

666
00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:56.897
Why you gotta act
like I'm aggressive
or something? I'm just...

667
00:46:58.273 --> 00:47:00.984
I'm making small talk
'cause I've never
seen her before.

668
00:47:01.026 --> 00:47:03.320
Well. that's all I got.
and I gotta work.

669
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.490
I know something about it.

670
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:08.992
Oh. yeah. what do you know?

671
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:12.246
Huh?

672
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:17.167
Hey.

673
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:20.128
Yeah. you.

674
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.007
Spare a couple of smokes
for a couple of pretty girls?

675
00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:29.346
- Yes. ma'am.
- Yeah?

676
00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:30.389
Yeah.

677
00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:32.057
Come and get them.

678
00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.601
- Alright. Come on.
- Uh-huh.

679
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:36.603
Thanks a lot.

680
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:43.360
Yeah? What?

681
00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:56.123
Oh. well. well.
well. well. well.

682
00:47:56.164 --> 00:47:58.250
now that looks like
a whole lot of fun.

683
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.503
You got a light?

684
00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.051
Hey!

685
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.178
- What?
- Not in here.

686
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.180
- You know that!
- Oh. come on. Star.

687
00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:14.433
- Really?
- Out back.

688
00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:16.226
Fuck.

689
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.812
I'm taking these.
You wanna come outside?

690
00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:20.814
Come on. Mister.
Come on. girl.

691
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:22.441
Are you sure it's unlocked?

692
00:48:22.482 --> 00:48:23.901
- Go. Yes.
- Thank you.

693
00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:35.162
Well...

694
00:48:46.214 --> 00:48:49.134
You ladies have a good evening.

695
00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:51.053
I got something better
waiting for me at home.

696
00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.179
What's that?

697
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:59.019
Oh. What's your pleasure?

698
00:49:00.395 --> 00:49:01.480
Mm.

699
00:49:02.564 --> 00:49:05.943
I do like me some
Scooby snacks. Right?

700
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:10.822
What about you. Miss?

701
00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:13.450
Well.
that's the best way

702
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.577
to spend a Saturday morning.

703
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.245
- Hey.
- Hey.

704
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:19.498
I'm looking
for that crazy girl
with the red hair.

705
00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:21.291
Not you. obviously.

706
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:22.793
Earline. yeah. why?

707
00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:24.711
'Cause she's just been in here
asking about you.

708
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:27.381
Really? Is she here now?

709
00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:30.342
- Might as well start now.
- Girl. Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
you know it.

710
00:49:39.017 --> 00:49:41.269
That meth head better not be
bringing trouble to my bar.

711
00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:42.604
No. no. no trouble. Star.

712
00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:44.314
I just wanna ask her
a couple questions.

713
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:50.654
You got a ride or what?

714
00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:53.240
I got a ride.

715
00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:55.117
Well. you're in luck.
She just went out back.

716
00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.451
Ah. Thanks.

717
00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:07.754
Hey. Star. she's not out there.
Did she come back through here?

718
00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:09.631
- No. love. sorry.
- Any idea where
she might've gone?

719
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.967
Yo. Star. this drink
ain't gonna refill itself. hon.

720
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.594
Hold your ass. Mickey.
It's coming.

721
00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:16.596
I'm sorry. Lisa.
I got no idea.

722
00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:28.692
Would you do me a favor
and take off your shoes. please?

723
00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:30.360
Seriously?

724
00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:32.029
Thank you.

725
00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:35.532
- This place is a--
- We are a guest
in this man's house.

726
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:37.492
Take off your shoes.

727
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:51.548
Yeah. girl. get it. Get it.

728
00:50:57.179 --> 00:50:58.680
Get it.

729
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:21.745
Mm.

730
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:29.127
Alright. Mm.

731
00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:46.978
Alright. that's my cue
to leave.

732
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.231
What do you mean?
The party's just getting started.

733
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.484
- I don't wanna leave yet.
- Oh. I know. doll. Trust me.

734
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.197
You're not leaving.

735
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:06.706
Hey. Squee. can I have
the keys to the truck?

736
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:10.127
Sure.

737
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.715
Oh. you know.
if you pick up
some eggs.

738
00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:17.843
I can make our favorite
sausage sandwiches.

739
00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:22.556
- Yeah.
- Go easy tonight. okay?

740
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.559
If you puke in the truck.
you're cleaning it up.

741
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.227
Right. yeah. Uh...

742
00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:29.312
You guys married or something?

743
00:52:30.105 --> 00:52:32.607
Oh. well. yeah.

744
00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:38.655
Oh. well. there's that.
But look. don't you
worry. honey.

745
00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:40.657
You just enjoy
your chicken flippin'. alright?

746
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.159
- Okay.
- Mm.

747
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.202
Yeah.

748
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:46.580
Are you ready?

749
00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.759
What's all this?

750
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.928
Oh. you know. I just got a...

751
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:05.390
little bit of a thing
for clear plastic.

752
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.642
You're fuckin' weird.

753
00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:10.187
Hmm. "Weird"?

754
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:12.397
Weird how?

755
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.108
Just in every way.

756
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.569
Well. that's a little vague.
Where are you going?

757
00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:20.488
I'm thirsty.
I'm gonna get a beer

758
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.032
before we consummate
the evening.

759
00:53:22.073 --> 00:53:23.825
Oh. no. no. please.

760
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.785
You're my guest.
Sit down. I can get it.

761
00:53:26.578 --> 00:53:28.705
Well. aren't you a gentleman?

762
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:31.583
Here. I can go grab you one.
and you can open it for me.

763
00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:47.807
I can explain.

764
00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:55.774
Oh. you looking
for Officer Jack?

765
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:57.734
He's in an investigation
right now

766
00:53:57.776 --> 00:53:59.027
with one of your sisters.

767
00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:01.947
- You'd do the work for me?
-  - Yeah.

768
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:04.449
- Is that what we're doing?
- Only if I can sit
in this chair.

769
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.993
You can sit in that chair.
That's the captain's chair.

770
00:54:07.035 --> 00:54:08.912
Oh. hey.

771
00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.623
I didn't-- I didn't know
you were coming by.

772
00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:14.542
- Clearly.
- Normally. you text first.

773
00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:17.796
I did text.
I guess you were busy

774
00:54:17.837 --> 00:54:19.673
looking down
your partner's shirt.

775
00:54:19.714 --> 00:54:21.633
Lisa. don't.

776
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:24.219
- Oh. it's okay.
- I wasn't looking down
anybody's shirt.

777
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.887
I'll see myself out.

778
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.013
Have fun.

779
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:32.519
Um...

780
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.314
So I... I came because
I heard you were talking
to some of the girls.

781
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:39.109
so I wanted to see
if you heard anything.
but I've...

782
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.069
You've clearly moved on
to another investigation...

783
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.779
- No.
- ...so I'm gonna...

784
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:44.447
- I'm gonna just go.
- No. Lisa. I have
been following up.

785
00:54:44.489 --> 00:54:46.700
I-- Lisa.

786
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:49.077
Lisa. you shouldn't
walk out like this.

787
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.788
We at least need to have
a conversation about this.

788
00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.210
- Ugh.
- Hey!

789
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:03.508
You were acting
like a crazy person.

790
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:06.136
- What the hell
is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?

791
00:55:06.177 --> 00:55:07.762
Every time I walk
into your office.

792
00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:10.724
that strippergram
is all over you.

793
00:55:10.765 --> 00:55:12.767
You walked out on me.
You don't get to say

794
00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.519
who I talk to or what I do.

795
00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.397
I guess it's true that a tiger
doesn't change his stripes.

796
00:55:20.233 --> 00:55:23.028
You promised me
to never bring that up again.

797
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:24.404
We are past that.

798
00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.531
You were so caught up
in your own bullshit.

799
00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:28.325
you haven't given any thought
to think about

800
00:55:28.366 --> 00:55:30.368
how hard these past two months
have been for me.

801
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:33.121
You're falling apart.
and you're taking us with you.

802
00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.790
- You still haven't
fixed this roof.
- Fuck.

803
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.500
Your whole life
is falling apart.

804
00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:39.294
and you'd rather freeze
to death than fix it.

805
00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.589
Whoa.

806
00:55:43.298 --> 00:55:45.008
What is it that you
wanna say. Jack?

807
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.384
- I didn't mean to say that.
- Just say it. You've been dying

808
00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:48.053
to say it this whole time.
so just say it.

809
00:55:48.094 --> 00:55:50.221
- You wanna say
that I'm selfish?
- All I'm trying to do

810
00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:51.431
is win you back.

811
00:55:55.226 --> 00:55:56.227
Hey.

812
00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:02.734
I'm sorry. okay?

813
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.195
Me too.

814
00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:09.366
- Not about the tart. though.
-  I'm not sorry about that.

815
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:16.956
Okay. you're not gonna
like this. but...

816
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.667
Joe was saying that the woman
at the hospital

817
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.252
had manure all over her.

818
00:56:21.294 --> 00:56:23.296
and an old couple is saying
that they were on the side

819
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:25.090
- of the farms by the track.
- Are you--

820
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.424
- Fucking right now?
- There's only three farms
with livestock.

821
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:28.676
You're talking about
this shit right now?

822
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:31.054
Stay the fuck out of my job.

823
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:33.473
This is becoming
your new addiction

824
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.767
and I don't wanna be
around you when you slide.

825
00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:40.146
Fuck.

826
00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:07.132
You know...

827
00:57:10.009 --> 00:57:12.137
I'm always up
for the hunt. but...

828
00:57:13.138 --> 00:57:14.431
I'm thinking...

829
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.977
maybe it's time
you take a break.

830
00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:24.774
For fuck's sake. Earline.

831
00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:29.070
You're the last person
I ever expected to be
talking me down off of crazy.

832
00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:32.157
Well. what are you trying
to say. Squee?

833
00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:35.201
I'm saying you're nuttier
than squirrel shit.

834
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:42.667
I think that's actually
the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

835
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:47.547
It's just...

836
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:51.885
It's just that I care. and...

837
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:56.806
I just...

838
00:57:57.932 --> 00:58:00.185
Even sounds kind of weird
to say out loud.

839
00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.063
Yeah. me too.

840
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:08.818
And you always said.

841
00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.321
"never too close together."

842
00:58:11.362 --> 00:58:13.448
Ain't never done 'em
too close together.

843
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.660
Yeah. well. things change.

844
00:58:20.955 --> 00:58:22.499
Know what I think?

845
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.834
No.

846
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.086
I think...

847
00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.256
that Lisa bitch
is making you hard.

848
00:58:30.757 --> 00:58:32.634
- Oh. come on. Earline.
- Mm-hmm.

849
00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:35.053
- You know that ain't it.
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:58:35.887 --> 00:58:37.472
But she is out there still.

851
00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:40.058
and I am keen on finding her.

852
00:58:41.643 --> 00:58:44.646
All I'm saying is.
if you get caught.

853
00:58:46.147 --> 00:58:48.066
don't you get me fucked
in the process.

854
00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.492
Speaking of...

855
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.371
Look at this pretty
little piggy right here.

856
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:02.872
Now?

857
00:59:04.415 --> 00:59:05.708
It ain't dark yet.

858
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.420
- Oh. I don't see
the difference.

859
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.923
Come on. Squee.

860
00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.217
Go.

861
00:59:17.262 --> 00:59:18.263
Please?

862
00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:22.267
- Hi.
- What do you guys want?

863
00:59:22.308 --> 00:59:25.103
Ah. hold on. hold on.
No. no. no.
Don't get...

864
00:59:25.144 --> 00:59:26.896
Don't get hostile.
I'm just being friendly.

865
00:59:26.938 --> 00:59:28.356
Actually. we're. uh...

866
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.984
We're going to a party.
and my friend here thought

867
00:59:31.025 --> 00:59:33.903
it might be fun
to invite you along.

868
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:35.154
I ain't a hooker.

869
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.949
I-I know that.

870
00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:41.035
And. look. he's not...
he's not looking to bone.

871
00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.830
Now. listen.
I know these...

872
00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:45.248
I know these looks
are deceiving.

873
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.125
but I'm telling you.
this guy is rich.

874
00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:49.794
So if he wanted to get laid.

875
00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.754
- he can just get
a top-shelf girl.

876
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.673
He don't look rich.

877
00:59:55.675 --> 00:59:56.759
Okay. look.

878
00:59:57.635 --> 00:59:59.345
Do you wanna go
to a party or not?

879
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.140
This guy is my friend.

880
01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:04.976
He has the best party favors.
and he likes to share them

881
01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.477
with pretty girls. and...

882
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.565
he thinks you're pretty.
but he's shy.

883
01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.276
which is why I'm here
talking to you. so...

884
01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.403
- Will you say something?
- Excuse me. ma'am.

885
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.284
You know you have
real kind eyes.

886
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.787
Are they green?

887
01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.332
Yeah.

888
01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.876
I've always wanted green eyes.

889
01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.547
What's your name?

890
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.216
Lulu. And yours?

891
01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.638
Molly Ringwald?

892
01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.891
You're funny.

893
01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:48.269
But are you rich?

894
01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.191
Come join us.

895
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.069
What's the worst
that could happen?

896
01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:03.576
What's the worst
that could happen?

897
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.746
Okey-dokey.

898
01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.884
Peace offering.

899
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.138
Come in.

900
01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.502
I just need
a little more time.

901
01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.381
A little more time.

902
01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.310
Oh...

903
01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.565
Oh. Mm.

904
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.328
- Oh...
- What's so funny?

905
01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:35.126
That's it. I have
no fucking idea
what's so funny. It just is.

906
01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:41.591
Mm.

907
01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:42.717
I get it.

908
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.179
I like to laugh too.

909
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.435
I think I'm gonna need you
to take your clothes off.

910
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.105
What the fuck. dude?
I thought you said no sex.

911
01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.701
What the fuck is it with you
letting these bitches get away?

912
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.329
Hey! If she gets away.
it's your ass too!

913
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.914
Get off your ass and help!

914
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.458
Well. you better go
find her. then.

915
01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:49.283
Here you are! Fuck you. pussy!

916
01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.203
I told you.

917
01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.122
they are not little pets.
you pussy!

918
01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.166
Oh. no. no. Please.

919
01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.877
I should have slit
your throat at birth!

920
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.421
He'll make good eats.

921
01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:04.757
So tender when they're little.

922
01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:10.012
Please...

923
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.360
Out comes the baby.

924
01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:40.144
I promise it'll only be
for a couple of weeks.

925
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.521
No. I told you.
you're welcome to stay
until the end of the month

926
01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.316
and then. you know.
you'll get settled
in your new job.

927
01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.109
and I'll help you find
a place of your own.

928
01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:59.664
Um. I. uh...

929
01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.959
I wanna start clean with you.

930
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.460
Please don't be mad.

931
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.090
I haven't done any in two weeks.
I was keeping this...

932
01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:11.550
...just in case.

933
01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.685
But I-I. I don't wanna hide

934
01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.186
anything from you. and I...

935
01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.106
I don't want that anymore.

936
01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:32.363
Are you mad?

937
01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.241
I'm not mad.

938
01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.619
Okay. because
this might sound silly. but...

939
01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.622
no one's ever been
this nice to me.

940
01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:45.459
I mean. no one even really knew
I existed. but...

941
01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.713
for some reason.
you believe in me.

942
01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.382
And I...

943
01:06:52.049 --> 01:06:54.093
wanna make you proud.
or whatever.

944
01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.764
I am-- I am proud
of you. Sadie.

945
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.642
It doesn't sound silly.
This is...

946
01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.854
This took a lot of courage.
Thank you for trusting me.

947
01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.486
Where'd you get it?

948
01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:16.615
- Please. Lisa.
- No. come on. seriously.

949
01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:18.492
It's really important. Sadie.

950
01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:21.620
N-no. no. no. no.
I-it was just
from some random kid

951
01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:23.956
- on the other side of town.
- What did he look like?

952
01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:27.168
I don't know.
A kid with a hoodie?

953
01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.336
- I mean. it could
have been anybody.

954
01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.047
- Lisa. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. it's--

955
01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.465
No. no. no.
don't be sorry. It's okay.

956
01:07:32.506 --> 01:07:33.924
But I-I gotta take this
to the station.

957
01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:35.718
- What? No. No.
- No. seriously. you're--

958
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.261
I promise you.
you're not in any trouble.

959
01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:39.638
I don't want you
to worry. okay?
I got you. girl.

960
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.015
- Lisa.
- This is our secret.

961
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.309
but this might be
a good lead on the case.

962
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.769
- "Secret"? But you're...
- They may be able to find out

963
01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.103
where it came from.

964
01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.315
Don't worry.
I'll be back in a flash.

965
01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:50.649
Please don't.

966
01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:51.942
Lisa. please.

967
01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.819
Fuck me. huh?

968
01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.328
- Hello?
- Hey.

969
01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:03.954
You at the station?

970
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.832
No. I'm just finishing up
with some asshole.

971
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.335
- What's up?
- You were right. Jack.

972
01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.295
Oh. good. I love it
when I'm right.

973
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:12.588
What was I right about?

974
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.090
I think it's time I let you in.

975
01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.968
I was hoping you'd come
to that conclusion.

976
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.303
Can you come over later?

977
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.846
Sadie's going to work soon.

978
01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:22.556
I thought we can talk some more

979
01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.309
and make up for lost time.
What do you think?

980
01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:27.186
I think I'll be
hightailing it over there

981
01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.979
just as soon
as I'm finished up here.

982
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:30.272
I'll see you soon.

983
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:37.029
Hey. hey. Good timing.

984
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.073
- You wanna take
the collar on this one?
- Okay.

985
01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.658
Okay. good. The perp's
in the back.

986
01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:42.409
My cruise is a little
worse for the wear.

987
01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.286
Do you mind if I take yours?
Ah. that's...

988
01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.996
You'll get a promotion for this.

989
01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.746
Thank you.

990
01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:30.040
No worries.

991
01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:48.309
Do you live here?

992
01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.521
No. ma'am. just. uh. here
to see a business colleague.

993
01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:55.482
After you.

994
01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.200
I don't live here either.

995
01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:05.826
Just staying with a friend.

996
01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:06.869
Oh.

997
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.003
So. what kind of business
are you in?

998
01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.631
Meat. Fresh meat.

999
01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:19.924
Like a butcher?

1000
01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:23.093
Yeah. Just slicing
and dicing meat.

1001
01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.554
Isn't that kind of weird?

1002
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.681
Killing? Chopping up animals?

1003
01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.059
You know. you get used to it.

1004
01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:32.478
Creatures don't even
see it coming.

1005
01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.731
Killing part's over in seconds.

1006
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.860
Well. that's good. I guess.
that they don't see it coming.

1007
01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:47.409
What about you?

1008
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:52.122
Um. actually. I just
started a new job.

1009
01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.959
I'm officially the receptionist
at the Lincoln Hotel.

1010
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.001
Really?

1011
01:10:56.877 --> 01:11:00.965
Wow. You know. I think
that you'll make
a fantastic receptionist.

1012
01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:02.967
- Really?
- Yeah.

1013
01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.554
You know. you look
so familiar to me.
Have we met?

1014
01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.598
I don't think so.

1015
01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.184
I mean.
it's a small town. but...

1016
01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.813
I'd never forget
eyes like yours.

1017
01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.109
Okay. well.
this is my stop.

1018
01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.570
You're staying with Lisa?

1019
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.365
Yes.

1020
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.117
That's who I'm here to see.

1021
01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:29.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

1022
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.578
That must be
why I recognize you.

1023
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.163
What did you say
your name was?

1024
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.916
Theodore.

1025
01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.751
Most people call me Squealer.

1026
01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:39.670
Okay.

1027
01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.422
Um. Lisa just ran out
for a minute.

1028
01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:44.550
but you are welcome to wait
with me if you'd like.

1029
01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.182
No. You know. I...
I don't wanna be an imposition.

1030
01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.643
I could just wait out here.

1031
01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:55.978
It's no imposition at all.

1032
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.730
Please. come in.

1033
01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.775
- Okay. then.
- Do you mind
if I call you Theo?

1034
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.697
My mama used to call me Theo.

1035
01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:25.025
Come on. pick up
for Christ's sakes.

1036
01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.947
Hey. Joe.

1037
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.618
Well. what the fuck
does he want?

1038
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.414
Listen. I think I found
your. uh. mysterious
red-haired girl.

1039
01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:41.792
They pulled into this pig farm
out here on the county road

1040
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.710
called. uh. Squealer's.

1041
01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.671
Oh. my God. that's got
to be the farm.

1042
01:13:45.712 --> 01:13:48.674
Focus. You're gonna take
my truck. okay?

1043
01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:50.551
- Okay.
- Okay. No. wait.

1044
01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:51.844
We're gonna see
if he follows you.

1045
01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.262
- Okay.
- If it's the farm he wants.

1046
01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.388
- I'll deal with it.
- Okay.

1047
01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.474
Hang tight and don't do
anything stupid.

1048
01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:59.643
Me don't do anything stupid.
You don't do anything stupid.

1049
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.228
- for Christ's sake.
- No. no. no.

1050
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.063
I'm-I'm gonna call Jack
right now. okay?

1051
01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.481
I'll let him handle it.

1052
01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.859
Put it down. Put it down.

1053
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.863
Okay. look. just don't touch
anything. okay?

1054
01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:13.031
Just don't--
You do know
how to drive. right?

1055
01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:16.743
I have stolen nicer cars
like this since I was 12.

1056
01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:19.121
- Do not insult me.
- And don't mess with my seat.

1057
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.581
Oh. come on.

1058
01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.332
- Hello. this is
Detective Jackson.
- No...

1059
01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.542
Leave a message.
and I'll get back to you

1060
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.668
- as soon as I can.
- Ugh.

1061
01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.255
Don't touch the temperature.
Don't touch the rearview mirror.

1062
01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.715
And don't touch the radio.

1063
01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:31.633
- Leave it on the opera.
- Uh-huh.

1064
01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:34.011
Don't touch it!

1065
01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:37.514
Hey. um. Jack.

1066
01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.267
Okay. um. you're not
gonna like this. but...

1067
01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:43.270
Joe just found that crazy girl
that I've been
telling you about.

1068
01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.522
and guess where she is?

1069
01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:49.276
There is a pig farm
and it's called Squealer's.
okay?

1070
01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.361
I'm gonna head
in that direction right now.

1071
01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.071
But don't worry.
I'll wait for you.

1072
01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.115
That fucking bitch.

1073
01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.843
Uh. yeah. he's gone.

1074
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.346
Okay. get your ass
back here. Now.

1075
01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:20.474
- And go gentle on my truck.
- Mm-hmm.

1076
01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:30.817
Lisa?

1077
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.995
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1078
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.582
Hey. Joe.
can you call me back?

1079
01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.335
I tried to take a shortcut.
but I think I got
turned around.

1080
01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.504
even my GPS doesn't know
where I am.

1081
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.686
Oh...

1082
01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:09.606
I missed you so much.

1083
01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:13.735
You're so cold.

1084
01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.242
Jesus Christ!

1085
01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:36.383
Thanks. I'm alright.

1086
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.176
Just get here
as soon as you can.

1087
01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.472
Hey. um. Jack.

1088
01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:44.516
Okay. um.
you're not gonna like this.

1089
01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.184
but Joe just found

1090
01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:48.228
that crazy girl that
I've been telling you about.

1091
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.938
and guess where she is?

1092
01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:55.861
No. no. no!

1093
01:16:55.902 --> 01:16:57.321
No!

1094
01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:03.869
Nothing. Oh. my God.

1095
01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.208
- Hello. this is
Detective Jackson.
- Ugh!

1096
01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.918
- Jack. come on.
- Leave a message.
and I'll get back to you

1097
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.253
as soon as I can.

1098
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.430
Ah. there you are.

1099
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.021
Joe. where are you?

1100
01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.023
I'm only a few miles
away from the farm.

1101
01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.067
but I really need someone
to come get me.

1102
01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:36.526
Call me. please.

1103
01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:46.745
But I know what it is.
You're pretty. right?
So you want somebody

1104
01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.330
to cut you in line...

1105
01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:51.083
...to make your stolen car
a priority over theirs.

1106
01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:52.501
Their car matters.

1107
01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:54.544
We even got--

1108
01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:57.130
We take every call.
You know what I mean?

1109
01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.884
Our clients
are a priority. We--

1110
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.053
- That's how
we've been in business.

1111
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.013
That's how we've been
in business this long.
You know what I mean?

1112
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.348
Oh. God.

1113
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:35.919
What the fuck are you doing?

1114
01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:39.673
You should probably check
on your friend. Danny. He's a...

1115
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.550
He's a real mental case.

1116
01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:43.677
Well. yeah.

1117
01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.430
- Something happened?
- Probably.

1118
01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.059
Earline. I don't know
what that means.

1119
01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:53.478
It means that things
are getting too hot around here.

1120
01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:57.858
You're leaving?

1121
01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:02.529
You know me. man.

1122
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:04.740
I'm like the wind.

1123
01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.783
I'll either see you around...

1124
01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:09.953
or I won't.

1125
01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.085
Okay.

1126
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:50.577
Did you see that bitch
who took my car?

1127
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.330
Why'd you give her your car?

1128
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.457
I didn't give her my car.

1129
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.502
She's gone.

1130
01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:02.506
You better call your fucking
psycho sidekick cunt bitch

1131
01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:04.049
and get her back here right now.

1132
01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.135
Now!

1133
01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.638
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Easy now!

1134
01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:11.681
Put that fucking bow down.

1135
01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:14.017
- Put my bow down!
- You motherfucker.

1136
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.978
Don't fuck with me.

1137
01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:23.276
Fuck!

1138
01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.375
You want a shoot-out
with me? Huh. pig boy?

1139
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:40.794
Is that what you want?

1140
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.630
- Let's go!
- Who the fuck
are you shooting at?

1141
01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:50.971
Drop your weapon.
or the next shot
will not be a warning.

1142
01:20:52.764 --> 01:20:55.350
Fuck. yeah. Let's go.

1143
01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.811
Drop your fucking weapon.

1144
01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.647
Who the fuck are you?

1145
01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.440
Why would I drop my weapon?

1146
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.277
You need to drop
your fucking weapon.

1147
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.072
Ow. fuck!

1148
01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:13.243
Ow!

1149
01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:18.832
Drop your fucking weapon!

1150
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.668
I do not wanna kill you.
I don't even know
who the fuck you are.

1151
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.005
I'm fucking Danny Diamond.
you fucking cunt.

1152
01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.757
It's your call.
but I got the drop on you.

1153
01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:29.426
If you don't tie that leg off.

1154
01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.052
you're gonna bleed out
pretty goddamn soon.

1155
01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:32.596
Ha-ha-ha!

1156
01:21:32.637 --> 01:21:33.847
Fuck you.

1157
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.932
Are you fucking
Nurse Ratched now?

1158
01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.893
You can't fucking beat me.

1159
01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:40.645
Ow!

1160
01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.335
Oh. shit.

1161
01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:13.803
You dirty little piggy.

1162
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.354
Okay...

1163
01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.106
Ooh. Officer Jack.

1164
01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:29.653
do you know what I do
to trespassing little pigs?

1165
01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:40.580
Like a zipper.

1166
01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.840
Oh.

1167
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.639
Oh. Oh. shh...

1168
01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.266
Look at that.
It's your darlin'. Lisa.

1169
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.645
You know what...

1170
01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:07.732
Know what I think we'll do?
Maybe call her later

1171
01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:10.610
and give her
a heartfelt goodbye. Huh?

1172
01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.113
Yeah.

1173
01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.335
Oh.

1174
01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:29.504
Thank God.

1175
01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.472
Oh. my God.

1176
01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.308
What's wrong?

1177
01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.061
No. no. no.

1178
01:24:26.102 --> 01:24:27.437
You had one slip.

1179
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.236
I've forgiven you.
You need to forgive yourself.

1180
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.792
You must be Lisa.

1181
01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.964
You think you can come
into my fucking house!?

1182
01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.097
You know we have friends
in common. right?

1183
01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:45.932
Sadie...

1184
01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.103
...is a sweet little thing.

1185
01:25:51.437 --> 01:25:53.481
And Jack? Oof.

1186
01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.567
He's a tough son of a bitch

1187
01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.068
and a heart of fucking gold.

1188
01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:46.344
That's lucky for me.

1189
01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:48.596
Unlucky for you.

1190
01:27:49.889 --> 01:27:52.141
I used most of the charge
on your lover

1191
01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:54.269
before I ripped
his fucking heart out!

1192
01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.078
Hear that?

1193
01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.625
This is called a bullnose.

1194
01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:21.838
It's an instrument for savages.

1195
01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.007
amateurs.

1196
01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.470
It has utility. but...

1197
01:28:31.097 --> 01:28:32.932
it lacks artistry.

1198
01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:36.686
nuance.

1199
01:28:38.062 --> 01:28:39.230
finesse.

1200
01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:43.776
What's the point?

1201
01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:51.284
This one. on the other hand...

1202
01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.952
Oof.

1203
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.120
This one...

1204
01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.875
...isn't a medium skinner.

1205
01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.586
Now. some butchers call this

1206
01:29:01.627 --> 01:29:03.713
a throat cutter
or a gut slasher.

1207
01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.007
but that's just naive.

1208
01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.217
This instrument here

1209
01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:12.305
is used for slicing
thin-skinned animals.

1210
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.431
like yourself.

1211
01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.145
Ahh!

1212
01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:32.617
Whoo!

1213
01:29:37.997 --> 01:29:39.457
Damn. look at that leg.

1214
01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.334
I know that hurt.

1215
01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.004
Tough little shit.

1216
01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.798
It's a shame
this didn't work out.

1217
01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.760
I think you and I
would make good friends.

1218
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.558
Fuck you.

1219
01:29:58.101 --> 01:29:59.644
Fucking is not really my game.

1220
01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.064
Slicin' and dicin'.
that's more my thing.

1221
01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.316
Seriously.
what is wrong with you?

1222
01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.447
I chalked it up to a cornflake
deficiency as a kid.

1223
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.158
Why the fuck do you do this?

1224
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.827
You wanna be famous
or something?

1225
01:30:16.619 --> 01:30:18.371
I don't much care
for the limelight.

1226
01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.874
I spend most of my time
in the darkness.

1227
01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.252
But I am gonna think of you

1228
01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:26.879
every single fucking time
I turn on my light.

1229
01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.423
You wanna know why?

1230
01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:30.133
'Cause I'm gonna
make a lampshade

1231
01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:33.678
out of your nice. smooth hide.

1232
01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:37.432
Fuck!

1233
01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:38.891
You're dead. you fucking...

1234
01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:51.404
Is that the best you got?

1235
01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.874
Goddamn. girl.

1236
01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:04.959
You do have heart.

1237
01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:15.178
I see why your entire
pathetic career

1238
01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:19.724
has been with helpless animals
and unconscious women.

1239
01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:21.642
you fucking pussy.

1240
01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:25.271
You fucking pussy!

1241
01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.401
Fucking pussy!

1242
01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.243
Goddamn! Ahh!

1243
01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.671
No. no. no. no. no! Ah. fuck!

1244
01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.009
No. no. no!

1245
01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.225
Tit for fucking tat!

1246
01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:04.185
No! No!

1247
01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.907
Help me!

1248
01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.891
What the fuck?

1249
01:32:45.434 --> 01:32:47.478
Jesus. you got yourself
in a real mess this time.

1250
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.688
haven't you?

1251
01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.357
Oh. that's definitely broken.

1252
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.486
You just couldn't leave it
alone. could ya? Huh?

1253
01:32:56.028 --> 01:32:58.239
Hey. You got a smoke?

1254
01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.286
You shouldn't be doing this.

1255
01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:04.495
I thought you quit.

1256
01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:06.205
If he couldn't kill me.

1257
01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.833
I figure one smoke
is not gonna do it.

1258
01:33:08.874 --> 01:33:09.875
Huh.

1259
01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.086
- Where is he?
- Oh.

1260
01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.134
Couldn't handle the grind.

1261
01:33:18.175 --> 01:33:19.468
Huh.

1262
01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:23.347
Okay.

1263
01:33:24.807 --> 01:33:26.642
There's the ambulance.
I'll be right back.

1264
01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.481
Oh. it's good.
