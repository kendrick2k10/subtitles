HOME"]

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.559
(SINGING) City streets

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:23.189
Unfamiliar skyline

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.359
Strangers who don't
look me in the eye

8
00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:31.281
I'm lost inside I'm blind

9
00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:39.748
But I know wherever I go

10
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.918
I'm never far from home

11
00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.504
No matter where I roam

12
00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.423
When I think of you

13
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.844
I'm never far from home

14
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.805
No matter where I roam

15
00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.766
When I think of you

16
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.601
I'm never far from home

17
00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.562
I'm never far from home

28
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:44.938
Good morning.

29
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.316
Ah!

30
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.443
It's time to wake up.

31
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.945
Oh. no!

32
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.947
My daughter's turned
into a stuffed dog!

33
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.698
Got you!

34
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.950
You did get me.

35
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.284
- You're so predictable.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.786
Can you predict what
I'm gonna say next?

37
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:00.495
We're late.

38
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.247
Yep.

39
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.540
Did you brush your teeth?

40
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.874
Your hair looks a little ratty.

41
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.585
Go run and get
your hair brushed.

42
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.379
What is your brush doing
in the silverware drawer?

43
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:10.922
We're always in
the kitchen when

44
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:11.923
you tell me to go get my brush.

45
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:12.632
Smart.

46
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.633
Also gross.

47
00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:14.843
It's not gross.

48
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.845
It's my word of the day.

49
00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.513
Efficient.

50
00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.723
Well. at least keep
it in the junk drawer.

51
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.599
[gasps] I forgot something!

52
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.560
Me. too.

53
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.686
Let's go. let's go. let's go.
- I'm coming.

54
00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.478
Come on.
Come on.

55
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.313
Come on.

56
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.356
[gasps] Do you really
need to bring your guitar?

57
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.360
Oh.

58
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:39.868
I love you.

59
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:40.827
Remember to help somebody.

60
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.953
I know.

61
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.205
Bye. baby Taylor.

62
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.415
Bye. Mommy.

63
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.291
I love you. too.

65
00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.512
All right. here we go.

66
00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:00.430
All right. TJ.

67
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.389
Ready to rock?

68
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.351
Yeah.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:19.699
Sorry.

72
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.201
Sorry. Doug.

73
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.452
Hey. you. uh. you
all right in there?

74
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.703
I shouldn't
audition before noon.

75
00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:24.913
I'm not a morning person.

76
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.623
That's all right. man.

77
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.042
Let's just-- we'll take
it back from the top.

78
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.294
Do you want me to play
a riff in the opener.

79
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.296
or should I play it straight?

80
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:37.467
Let's do one as it's
written. and then. that's it.

81
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.636
Yeah.

82
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.098
[light music]

83
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.279
We're in the kitchen.

84
00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.114
I know.

85
00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.657
So how did it go?

86
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:01.449
Terrible.

87
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.325
No.

88
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.243
I'm sure you did great.

89
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.327
No.

90
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.831
I was wooden. and I blew it.

91
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.041
Lead guitar on
John Tyler's tour.

92
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.459
That would have been huge.

93
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.044
- You'll get the next one. Mijo.
- Yes.

94
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.421
Yes.
TJ: Ah. I don't think so.

95
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.381
So what have you been up to?

96
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.466
Ma's planning
Mateo's birthday.

97
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.510
We're going to have it
here in the greenhouse.

98
00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.178
Of course.

99
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.097
And she's not letting
me do anything at all.

100
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.056
Of course.

101
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.391
I still wanna be involved.

102
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.018
So I can keep it contained.

103
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.020
Who wants a party contained?

104
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.312
Maybe your daughter?

105
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.188
Fine.

106
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.065
It'll be contained.

107
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.567
Just la familia.

108
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.277
And 200 of her
closest friends.

109
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.613
[chuckles] Do you need a nap?

110
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.489
He's a grown man.

111
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.365
He doesn't need a nap.

112
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.450
I think I do need a nap.

113
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.826
I was practicing till 2:00 AM.

114
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.578
You're always up
until 2:00 AM. TJ.

115
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.538
- That's my most creative time.
- Mm.

116
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.623
Well. it's a good thing
you don't have kids.

117
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.418
I'm on the farm
stand today. so. mwah.

118
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.211
Hey. Mijo. fresh
out of the oven.

119
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.087
New recipe.

120
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.714
Thank you. Dad.

121
00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.090
I'll cut out the bouncy house.

122
00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.133
Hey. thank you. Mommy.

123
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.889
Ooh.

124
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.807
More self-help.

125
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.642
It was self-help in the '80s.

126
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.061
It's self-care now.

127
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.437
- So sorry.
- No.

128
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.064
And this book is
actually really good.

129
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.775
It's all about challenging
our self-imposed limitations.

130
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.902
So it suggests. instead
of saying no to ourselves.

131
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.612
we say. not yet.

132
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.946
Mm.

133
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.448
Can I send you a
copy of the book?

134
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.867
Not yet.

135
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.535
Oh. what'd I get?

136
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.204
A juice box today. or
just a quarter for milk?

137
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.290
Just be glad that your
business partner cares

138
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.416
about you as much as I do.

139
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.417
I appreciate the TLC.
I do.

140
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.211
I do.

141
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.170
I just-- I would like it
if we could actually go

142
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.505
out to lunch one of these days.

143
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.174
And that's why I
handle the books.

144
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:42.926
[chuckles]

145
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.429
I'm excited to announce
our next big-term project.

146
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.598
We'll be exploring our heritage.

147
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.726
Who knows what heritage means?

148
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.353
Like. where our
families come from?

149
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.813
MISS WEAVER: Somewhat. yes.

150
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.148
But heritage also
means what's been

151
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.275
passed down from our ancestors.

152
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.404
Culture. tradition stories.

153
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.324
And to explore this. we'll
each be making a family tree.

154
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.742
My tree is gonna be so big.

155
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.204
I have like 14 aunts and uncles.

156
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.206
But I only have Auntie Maura.

157
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.250
She's not even really my aunt.

158
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.086
Well. there are all
different types of families.

159
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.172
So as you map out the
generations of your family.

160
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.259
I'd like you to talk to your
relatives about your heritage.

161
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.471
Learn where you come from. and
how that makes you who you are.

162
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.932
You'll have two months to
complete it. so take your time.

163
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.851
We'll also have
in-class activities.

164
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.937
like bringing your family
in to discuss heritage.

165
00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.940
You can talk to your
grandparents. aunts and uncles.

166
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:39.607
anyone in your family.

167
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.488
[bell ringing]

168
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.406
Bye. kids.

169
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.332
Um. Miss Weaver?

170
00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.086
I was just wondering if I could
do a different term project.

171
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.713
Why?

172
00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.341
Because I don't really
have any heritage.

173
00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.676
My family tree would kind
of just look like a weed.

174
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.136
What do you mean?

175
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.722
Do you know what IVF is?

176
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.057
Yes. I do.

177
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.809
So my only family is my mom.

178
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.269
Well. does your
mom have any family?

179
00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.355
Not really.

180
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.898
She's an only child. and her dad
went away when she was little.

181
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.524
Mm.

182
00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:22.650
My Nana passed
away when I was two.

183
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.736
That's who I'm named after.

184
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.739
So it's really
just my mom and me.

185
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.700
A family tree can
look like anything.

186
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:34.954
Remember. some weeds turn into
the most beautiful flowers.

187
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:35.580
Thanks.

188
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.421
[children chattering]

189
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.471
AMELIA: Ruby.

190
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.895
A minor?

191
00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.729
Tough day?

192
00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.272
What happened?

193
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.358
Miss Weaver assigned
our next big project.

194
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.568
And it's a family tree.

195
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.946
But I can't really be a family
tree because it's just and me.

196
00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.572
And Nana.

197
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.616
Yeah. that's one branch.

198
00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.201
That's not a tree.

199
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.869
It's like a log.

200
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.287
Sweetie. we're a family.

201
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.373
RUBY: I know.

202
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.001
But also. I was thinking.
what about my biological dad?

203
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.961
Your donor?

204
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.212
Sweetie. he wanted
to be anonymous.

205
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.755
You know that.

206
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.507
But you said when I
got older. you'd show

207
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.217
me some sheet you have on him.

208
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.554
Ah. love. we're a family.

209
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:33.763
We're enough.

210
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.099
I know. and I love our family.

211
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.851
It's just. I'm curious. is all.

212
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.144
What's even on the sheet?

213
00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.066
Mm-- oh!

214
00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.776
There you are.

215
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.069
Did he touch this paper?

216
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:48.778
I don't think so.

217
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.113
It's just a printout.

218
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.489
It's just some
basic information.

219
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.324
There's a baby picture.

220
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.576
And he looks just like me.

221
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.744
Hah!

222
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:56.870
He does. doesn't he?

223
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:57.746
Yeah.

224
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.460
Height. age. eye and hair color.

225
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.836
Is this all the information?

226
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:05.962
Is this how you picked him?

227
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.714
Well-- somewhat.

228
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.592
But I-- I also picked
him because of his laugh.

229
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.760
Mm?

230
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.803
Wait. you know what?

231
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:17.265
I think I have an old recording
of his voice from an email.

232
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.309
See if I can--

233
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:23.355
You've had a recording for
nine years and never told me?

234
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.940
I was a little
preoccupied raising

235
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.568
a well-adjusted young woman
in an ever-changing world.

236
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.070
Oh. wait.

237
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.988
Here it is.

238
00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.990
So this is an interview
he did with the agency.

239
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.784
It's just audio only.

240
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.202
OK.

241
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.828
DONOR (ON AUDIO):
[laughs] I'm sorry.

242
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.246
[laughs] I'm a little nervous.

243
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.539
INTERVIEWER (ON
AUDIO): It's fine.

244
00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.665
You can say whatever you want.

245
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.668
DONOR (ON AUDIO): OK.

246
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.171
Well. um. (STAMMERS) I laugh
when I'm nervous. obviously.

247
00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:52.676
And. uh. I live for
music. to make music.

248
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.636
And I hate mushrooms.

249
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:55.970
Love olives.

250
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.305
I love anything pickled.
And--

251
00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.807
Me. too

252
00:09:58.973 --> 00:09:59.474
DONOR (ON AUDIO): I
love all desserts.

253
00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.184
Me. too.
Me. too.

254
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.020
DONOR (ON AUDIO): I am
bad at describing myself.

255
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.815
You know-- yeah. that's it.

256
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.691
Mm.

257
00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.983
His laugh. oh my gosh.

258
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.151
I know.

259
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.320
That's why I picked him.

260
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.405
He sounded kind.

261
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.156
Maybe there's a
way to find him.

262
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.575
When you're 18. you
can request contact.

263
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.037
But 18 is a
million years away.

264
00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.665
I guess you're gonna be
super old when you're 18.

265
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.208
[doorbell ringing]

266
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.042
That's Auntie Maura.

267
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.419
She's coming for dinner.

268
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.420
You do your reading. OK?

269
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.175
And now she wants
to find her donor.

270
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.510
Yeah. of course she does.

271
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.429
Ruby's approaching
an age where she's

272
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.972
gonna wanna explore who she
is and where she comes from.

273
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.181
She comes from here.

274
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.766
She comes from me.

275
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.768
Yeah. well. she's also
genetically half him.

276
00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.061
and that still means something.

277
00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.229
AMELIA: Sure.

278
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.689
But who knows what he's like?

279
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.859
And do we even wanna
roll the dice on that?

280
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.445
And even if we wanted to find
him. it's not like we could.

281
00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.488
Mm. that's not
necessarily true.

282
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.574
Now. see. I've read
articles about this.

283
00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.827
Donor-conceived children who
use genetic registry to track

284
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.412
down their biological parents.

285
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.831
What's a "genelli rhetory?"

286
00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.042
What Aunt Maura
said. what is it?

287
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.295
It is genotyping.
to test your DNA.

288
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.048
You send a saliva
sample to a company.

289
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.216
and they test it to
learn about everything

290
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.928
from your physical traits. to
your health predispositions.

291
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:22.140
to your biological relatives.

292
00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.975
So we could do
that to find him?

293
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.227
Maybe. but it is
highly unlikely.

294
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.479
But we could still try.

295
00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.438
Ruby. I wanna
put a pin in this.

296
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.647
OK?

297
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.107
Can you go finish your homework?

298
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:31.941
Please?

299
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.026
Dinner's almost ready.

300
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.445
Thank you.

301
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.905
(SOFTLY) I am so sorry.

302
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.198
Can you just put
this on the table?

303
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:38.990
Yeah.

304
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.658
Thank you very much.

305
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.620
[whimsical music]

306
00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.915
[distant clattering]

307
00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.342
[alarm ringing]

308
00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:58.176
Ruby?

309
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.263
Ruby?

310
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.264
Oh.

311
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.432
Good morning.

312
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:05.725
I made you coffee.

313
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.227
Oh.

314
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.103
OK.

315
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.145
Go on.

316
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.815
Try it.

317
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.817
You just put the black
stuff in some water. right?

318
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.151
Ah. yeah. something like that.

319
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.362
Ah. OK.

320
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.823
What is-- what is going on here?

321
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:23.660
Ruby's 10-point presentation
on why I should be able to do

322
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.662
the genetic registry thingy.

323
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:31.042
Point one. I am not a baby.

324
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.087
This should be our
decision together.

325
00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.298
Point two. school project.

326
00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.468
You're always saying how
important learning is.

327
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:44.055
And this school project is
about learning who I am--

328
00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:47.851
like. um. is my
donor clumsy like me?

329
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.686
Is he always
crashing into stuff?

330
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:53.773
Love. these are great points.
but he wanted to be anonymous.

331
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.691
He might not wanna be found.

332
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.443
But what if he does?

333
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.112
What if he's just waiting
for us to find him?

334
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.906
You're always telling
me to help someone.

335
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.870
What if this helps all of us?

336
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:07.996
I wanna know where I come from.

337
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.167
Come here.

338
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.168
Ooh.

339
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.586
Oh.

340
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.546
I always knew this
day would come.

341
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.840
I just-- I didn't expect it to
come so soon. so you're gonna

342
00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.468
have to be patient with me.

343
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.219
Oh.

344
00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.639
I am open to looking
into this. but it's gonna

345
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.517
have to be on my timetable.

346
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.603
I am still your mother. and
I can prove that very easily.

347
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.479
Can we agree to that?

348
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.229
Mm-hmm.

349
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.815
Mm-hmm.

350
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.568
Maybe we can pick up a
test after school today?

351
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.195
Or before school.

352
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.780
What did I just say
about my timetable?

353
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.239
Yeah. your timetable.

354
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.742
It's just I already
ate breakfast.

355
00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:49.412
and I made our lunches.

356
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.956
It's a spaghetti burrito.

357
00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.501
You put spaghetti
inside a burrito?

358
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.336
With ranch dressing.

359
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.881
Oh ho ho ho.

360
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.007
Hi.

361
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:01.758
How's it going?

362
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.636
AMELIA: Hey.

363
00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:05.887
How'd it go with Ruby?

364
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.639
She bring the idea back up?

365
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.265
Actually. I know Ruby
well enough to know

366
00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:10.975
that she is driving that train.

367
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.394
And I know you
well enough to know

368
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.562
that you're pumping the brakes.

369
00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:18.733
Actually. we picked up a
genetic registry test on the way

370
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.526
to school today.

371
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.735
Oh-- what?

372
00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.153
Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.489
Wow.

374
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.241
I'm proud of you.

375
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.243
We probably won't
find anything anyway.

376
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.328
And even if we do. it's not
like we have to contact him.

377
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.414
And even if we do
contact him. he

378
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.207
probably won't wanna have
anything to do with her.

379
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.418
you know.
And-- and even if he does--

380
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.503
[breathes deeply] you
know. it's not his choice.

381
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.546
So I'm not worried about it.

382
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.505
Yeah. no.

383
00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.881
I-- I can tell.

384
00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.508
You seem super chill about it.

385
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.510
[sighs]

386
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.434
It's just always been
just the two of us.

387
00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.441
And I've worked really hard
to make her feel like--

388
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.985
like that's OK.

389
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.777
Like we're enough.

390
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.616
What if she suddenly
decides that we're not?

391
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.205
Just make sure that
it's nice and snug.

392
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:14.956
OK.

393
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.750
RUBY: So that's it?

394
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.793
Mail it in. and they
email us his information?

395
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.129
If there's any information.
which is a big if.

396
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.422
Plus. it takes time.

397
00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.049
It could take several weeks.

398
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.217
Has it been several weeks yet?

399
00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.594
OK. I got to do a
word of the day for you.

400
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.345
What?

401
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.929
Patience.

402
00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.139
I'm gonna go put
it in the mailbox.

403
00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:37.145
[children chattering]

404
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.607
Did the genetic
registry email come?

405
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:41.441
Oh.

406
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.484
Hi. Mommy.

407
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.318
How was your day?

408
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.195
That was all implied.

409
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.571
So. did it come?

410
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.323
Um. honey. it's
only been two weeks.

411
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.658
It's gonna take a
little bit longer. OK?

412
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.827
RUBY: I guess I'll just have
to write another future hit

413
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:53.620
while I wait.

414
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.591
[phone chiming]

415
00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:11.763
(SINGING) All I
need. all I want

416
00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:16.101
Is to keep the things that I got

417
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:24.943
Because it took
some time to find

418
00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:29.114
I have dreams just like you

419
00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:33.326
For the skies of
tomorrow to be blue

420
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:41.543
Do we need to close our eyes

421
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.878
Can't change the world

422
00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:49.259
Oh oh it's not long

423
00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.429
If we took it in turn

424
00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:58.852
Oh oh. I think we
could. you know

425
00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:03.732
'Cause we're in this together

426
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.651
Ooh ooh ooh

427
00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:07.736
You're not alone

428
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.237
Are we in this together?

429
00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.582
Love will show us where to start

430
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:25.003
Moving mountains with our hearts

431
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:31.259
All we need is to be here

432
00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:37.724
[clears throat] Uh. excuse me?

433
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.225
Yeah. we're--
we're not open today.

434
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.101
AMELIA: Oh.

435
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:46.941
[light music]

436
00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.245
May I help you?

437
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.080
Is this you?

438
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.252
Yes.

439
00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.924
What is this about?

440
00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:11.966
You know. never mind.
Sorry.

441
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.093
I'm sorry.
- Wait.

442
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:13.968
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

443
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.138
Is there something
I should know?

444
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.311
[exhales] Yes.

445
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.688
Yes.

446
00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.482
Um-- you kind of
have a daughter.

447
00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.202
[melancholic music]

448
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.203
Thank you for telling me.

449
00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:44.207
What's she like?

450
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.251
She's on her
own little planet.

451
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.044
in the absolute best way.

452
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.798
She's hilarious and kind.

453
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:52.841
She's bright.

454
00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.593
She's so precocious.

455
00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.722
She. uh. she plays guitar.

456
00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.348
What?

457
00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.642
I'm a guitarist.

458
00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.769
It means it's genetic.

459
00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.229
That's wild.

460
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.689
So are you a
professional musician?

461
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.481
Yeah.

462
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:09.649
Yeah.

463
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.483
Is it good work?

464
00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.110
Yeah. it is.

465
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.695
If you can get it.
which lately. I can't.

466
00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.031
Um. that's why I work here.

467
00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.490
It's a family business.

468
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.617
My parents bought the
land 40 years ago.

469
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.370
Started small. but then
it grew to all this.

470
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:25.665
And. uh. I read online that
you started the whole farmers

471
00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.584
market co-op thing. too?

472
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.419
It's pretty cool.

473
00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:30.503
It's a great community
between artisans and farmers.

474
00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:39.262
So-- what now?

475
00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.476
Maybe we just let
it marinate for a bit?

476
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:52.984
OK.

477
00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.402
OK.

478
00:19:54.527 --> 00:20:00.200
Amelia. I'd really
like to meet her.

479
00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.625
He seems nice. like
I thought he'd be.

480
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.087
He also seems like a brooding.
bad-boy musician type.

481
00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.089
Oh. Daddy was a Rolling Stone.

482
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.466
Exactly.

483
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:20.011
It's like. smoldering
and bacchanalian.

484
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.554
He's probably a total
commitment phobe.

485
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.473
And how long did
you talk to him for?

486
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.683
I don't know. like
10 or 15 minutes?

487
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.059
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

488
00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:26.893
What?

489
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.812
I don't know.

490
00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.814
It just sounds like you
really got this guy pegged.

491
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.065
And now he wants to meet her.

492
00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.483
Yeah. of course!

493
00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:34.526
And she's gonna
wanna meet him. too.

494
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:35.902
But he's a total stranger.

495
00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.696
OK. so vet him.

496
00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.698
I mean. look.

497
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.324
Of all the genetic
possibilities in the world.

498
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.577
you chose him. and now's your
opportunity to find out why.

499
00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.413
I guess I could just
like get a cup of coffee.

500
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.456
Yeah.

501
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.959
It's just coffee-- with your
long-lost bad boy baby daddy.

502
00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:52.794
That is not helpful.

503
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.462
It's fun to say.

504
00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:57.132
[light music]

505
00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.968
(SOFTLY) To go with you?

506
00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.429
Mijo. what's wrong?

507
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:06.516
Did you take a
genetic registry test?

508
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.059
Yes.

509
00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.894
So other relatives
could find us.

510
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:15.400
Turns out. uh. a relative
of sorts did find us.

511
00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:21.489
I kind of have a daughter.

512
00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.116
What?

513
00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.327
TJ: As-- it's not--
it's not what you think.

514
00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.955
Do you remember when I came
back to the States. and I was--

515
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.374
Mijo. it doesn't matter.

516
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.793
You have a daughter.

517
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.128
It's wonderful.

518
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.218
AMELIA: I came out here
for my master's. and then I

519
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.553
love it here.
Just stayed.

520
00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:44.637
So your family's
in California?

521
00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:45.680
No.

522
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:46.723
No-- no family.

523
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:47.474
Like none?

524
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.142
No.

525
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:52.354
Um. well. I was very
close with my mom.

526
00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.772
but she passed a while back.

527
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.566
And she was estranged
from her family.

528
00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:57.692
so it was always
just the two of us.

529
00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:58.693
So. yes.

530
00:21:58.777 --> 00:21:59.527
Mm.

531
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.196

533
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.657
Do you have a partner?

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.374
That must be tough.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.209
Well. I guess I'm tough.

540
00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:15.085
Yeah. I can see that.

541
00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:15.877
Yeah.

543
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.637

thought to me meeting Ruby?

Aah-ah.

548
00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:34.145
I guess I'm just concerned
that she's gonna meet

549
00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:37.565
you. and then get attached?

550
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:39.192
I guess that
could be a problem.

551
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.360
Yeah.

552
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.487
Yeah.

553
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:46.116
I mean. especially since you got
your whole life thing going on.

554
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.617
What thing is that?

555
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:49.285
I mean. you know.
you's like-- your whole.

556
00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:52.580
like. rock-and-roll thing.

557
00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:53.665
The gigs and the--

558
00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:54.416
Hang on.

559
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:55.834
Hang on.

560
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:57.043
How many working
musicians do you know?

561
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.503
I do not--

562
00:22:58.628 --> 00:22:59.629
I do not know any
working musicians.

563
00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:01.214
OK.

564
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:02.799
So I don't think
it's fair for you

565
00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:05.051
to make assumptions
about my lifestyle.

566
00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:05.760
You don't even know me.

567
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.137
Yeah.

568
00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.139
OK. that's the problem. though.

569
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.598
Because I don't know you.

570
00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:13.018
I don't know you at all.

571
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.520
And I'm supposed to decide
whether I want my daughter to?

572
00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:18.732
Amelia. you reached out to me.

573
00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:22.986
I assume you'd-- you imagine
that I would like to meet Ruby.

574
00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:25.530
But I'd hate to
make assumptions.

575
00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:31.578
Yeah. that would
be very unfair.

576
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.084
TJ (ON RECORDING):
[laughs] I'm sorry.

577
00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:39.544
I'm a little nervous.

578
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:40.545
INTERVIEWER (ON
AUDIO): It's fine.

579
00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:41.338
You can say whatever you want.

580
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.340
TJ (ON RECORDING): OK.

581
00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:46.760
Well. um. (STAMMERS) I laugh
when I'm nervous. obviously.

582
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:51.097
And. uh. I live for
music. to make music.

583
00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:53.224
And I hate mushrooms.

584
00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:54.851
Love olives.

585
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.605
I love anything pickled.
and I love all desserts.

586
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.150
And I'm bad at
describing myself.

587
00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:04.361
[laughs] I'm sorry.

588
00:24:04.527 --> 00:24:05.862
I'm a little nervous.

589
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.905
INTERVIEWER (ON
AUDIO): It's fine.

590
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.655
You can say whatever you want.

591
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:09.699
TJ (ON RECORDING): OK.

592
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:12.994
Well. um. (STAMMERS) I laugh
when I'm nervous. obviously.

593
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.788
And. uh. I live for music

594
00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:15.789
Ruby?

595
00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:16.748
Oh. I'm-- I'm--

596
00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:18.208
I'm-- I'm sorry.

597
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:19.167
I-- I wasn't. like
looking at your--

598
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.418
I'm not mad.
I just--

599
00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:21.836
- --email or anything.
- It's OK.

600
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.629
It was just already
downloaded. and I--

601
00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:23.505
I'm not mad.

602
00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:24.881
I'm not mad.

603
00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:25.924
I just have something
to tell you.

604
00:24:26.007 --> 00:24:26.633
Did it come?

605
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:27.425
It did come.

606
00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:28.301
Yes.

607
00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:31.137
And I found him.

608
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:31.971
You found him?

609
00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:33.431
Like. in person?

610
00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:34.224
- Mm-hmm.
- I wanna meet him.

611
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:34.974
Can I?

612
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.351
OK.

613
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.561
So before I say yes. I just--

614
00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:40.689
I need you to listen
to me. sweetie. OK?

615
00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:42.982
I know you have a lot
of really big ideas

616
00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:46.361
about what you want this to be.
about who you want him to be.

617
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:48.655
And I know--

618
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.574
I know it's easy to get
lost in those ideas.

619
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:56.705
If you can. honey. I'd really
like for you to remain measured.

620
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.289
Do you know what I mean by that?

621
00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:01.251
Like. only a certain
amount of something?

622
00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:03.169
Yeah. exactly.

623
00:25:03.253 --> 00:25:04.504
So I get to meet him?

624
00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:05.338
Mm-hmm.

625
00:25:05.505 --> 00:25:06.089
Yeah.

626
00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:09.467
[dramatic music]

627
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:25.483
Oh.

628
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:31.906
Ah-- that is so not measured.

629
00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:32.741
I'm TJ.

630
00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:33.491
Hi. TJ.

631
00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:34.534
I'm Ruby.

632
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:35.410
Ruby.

633
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:36.119
Lovely to meet you.

634
00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:37.537
[sighs]

635
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.043
RUBY: And you sneeze
when you look at the sun?

636
00:25:43.168 --> 00:25:44.586
[sneezes]

637
00:25:44.753 --> 00:25:45.253
I don't think so.

638
00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:46.087
Do you?

639
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:47.756
Sometimes.

640
00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:49.341
But are you allergic
to cantaloupe?

641
00:25:49.507 --> 00:25:50.467
Oh. yeah. yeah.

642
00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:51.843
It makes my mouth all itchy.

643
00:25:51.968 --> 00:25:53.261
Me. too!

644
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:54.304
Are you a morning person?

645
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:55.430
No.

646
00:25:55.597 --> 00:25:57.557
Nights are my creative time.

647
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.394
That's what I tell my mom. but
she still gives me a bedtime.

648
00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:02.520
And when you eat asparagus--

649
00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:04.064
OK.

650
00:26:04.147 --> 00:26:05.398
Let's just-- let's
give TJ a break here.

651
00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:06.191
It's OK.

652
00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:07.233
I like questions.

653
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.318
AMELIA: [laughs] OK.

654
00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:11.988
But I have a question for you.

655
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:13.156
Is it true that you play guitar?

656
00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:15.367
RUBY: Yeah.

657
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.410
I mean. I'm not a savant or
anything. but I will be someday.

658
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:18.578
I like the word savant.

659
00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:20.246
It's my word of the day.

660
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.248
I'm learning a
new word every day

661
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:23.667
so I'll be a better songwriter.

662
00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:25.919
I'm gonna be just
like Taylor Swift.

663
00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:27.545
I even have her same guitar.

664
00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:28.171
Baby Taylor.

665
00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:29.214
Yes!

666
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:30.799
You like Taylor Swift?

667
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.634
I've been known to
dabble. yeah. yeah.

668
00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:34.052
I play the guitar. too.

669
00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.262
What kind of
guitar do you play?

670
00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:39.766
I play different ones for
different moods. different eras.

671
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:42.435
You have to try out the
instrument. you know.

672
00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:44.771
You have to see if you're
interconnected with your guitar.

673
00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:46.690
What's that mean?

674
00:26:46.815 --> 00:26:47.732
It means you're connected.
but you're also independent.

675
00:26:47.857 --> 00:26:48.566
Oh.

676
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:49.609
Like panda?

677
00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.361
- Ah.
- What's that?

678
00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:52.946
RUBY: We learned
about it in science.

679
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:56.574
It's this whole Aspen
forest here in Utah

680
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.704
made of over 47.000
trees. but they all

681
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.622
come from the same root system.

682
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:04.582
It's called "Panda. the Tree."

683
00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:06.126
You never learned about it?
- Hm?

684
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:06.918
I think I just did.

685
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.756
I have a surprise for you.

686
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:12.590
Oh?

687
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.137
TJ: Cinnamon churros.
cinnamon buñuelos.

688
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:18.555
cinnamon cookie.
because your mom

689
00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:20.724
told me that you like cinnamon.

690
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.267
Mm.

691
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.393
AMELIA: What do you think?

692
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.145
This is like
heaven in a stick.

693
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.105
[laughs]

694
00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:30.150
Um. I got to make
a quick phone call.

695
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.109
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

696
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:31.860
You all right?

697
00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:33.028
OK.

698
00:27:33.111 --> 00:27:33.945
Yeah.

699
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.779
No. that sounds great.

700
00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:36.823
OK.

701
00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:38.158
Um. yeah. I'll just check in
with you when I'm leaving. OK?

702
00:27:38.283 --> 00:27:40.076
Thank you.

703
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.828
Oh. wait.

704
00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:43.413
Are you Amelia?

705
00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:45.081
I'm Sofia.

706
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:45.957
TJ's mom.

707
00:27:46.082 --> 00:27:47.375
OK.

708
00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:48.376
Oh. forgive me.

709
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.502
I get emotional.

710
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:52.172
But this is just
such a blessing.

711
00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:53.798
Oh.

712
00:27:53.923 --> 00:27:55.967
And-- and this is
TJ's dad. Tomas.

713
00:27:56.134 --> 00:27:58.511
TJ stands for Tomas. Jr.

714
00:27:58.595 --> 00:27:59.512
It's nice to meet you.

715
00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:01.806
It's nice to meet you. too.

716
00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:03.183
I'm gonna get back
to my daughter.

717
00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:05.101
Oh. yeah.

718
00:28:05.268 --> 00:28:07.270
But-- but before you do.
I was wondering if you

719
00:28:07.437 --> 00:28:08.480
and I could get
together one day?

720
00:28:08.563 --> 00:28:11.149
You know. have a cafecito.

721
00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:13.109
Well. that is so nice.

722
00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:14.194
That's such a nice offer.

723
00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:16.237
Thank you.

724
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.698
Um-- I-- this just-- it
feels like a lot. so. um.

725
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:20.658
can I get back to you?

726
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:21.409
Of course.

727
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:22.452
- OK.
- Yeah.

728
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:23.286
OK.

729
00:28:25.663 --> 00:28:26.331
OK.

730
00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:27.791
What did I miss?

731
00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:30.043
I just asked TJ to
come speak at my school

732
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.294
for Heritage Day on Monday.

733
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:32.879
You did?

734
00:28:33.004 --> 00:28:35.423
Uh. honey. you already
asked me to present.

735
00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:38.343
Oh. but some kids have
two parents presenting.

736
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:43.223
Or-- or-- or even people that
aren't. like. actually parents.

737
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:44.307
but kind of technically. are.

738
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:45.892
It's OK.

739
00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:47.268
It's-- it's a
complicated situation.

740
00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:48.353
It is.
TJ: Yeah.

741
00:28:48.436 --> 00:28:49.521
It's complicated.

742
00:28:49.688 --> 00:28:51.940
It's a real conundrum.

743
00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:53.441
Oh. is that a new
word of the day?

744
00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:54.734
Mm-hmm.

745
00:28:54.859 --> 00:28:57.028
So will you come to my school?

746
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:57.987
Please?

747
00:28:58.154 --> 00:28:58.697
Please?

748
00:28:58.863 --> 00:29:00.031
OK. honey. I--

749
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:01.533
You could talk
about your family.

750
00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:03.284
and traditions and stuff.

751
00:29:03.368 --> 00:29:06.037
Uh. you know. what it's like
to be a famous musician?

752
00:29:06.204 --> 00:29:07.997
AMELIA: Honey. I just--

753
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:10.208
I don't wanna put too much
pressure on TJ right now. OK?

754
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:11.960
I can check my schedule.

755
00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:12.794
Yes!

756
00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:13.712
OK.

758
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:17.841
Oh. my turn now.

759
00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.883
One second.

760
00:29:19.009 --> 00:29:20.760
Hi.

761
00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:22.095
How you doing. honey?

762
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.389
You OK?

763
00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:25.849
Are you kidding?

764
00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:28.351
I'm crushing it.

765
00:29:28.518 --> 00:29:29.686
Well. yeah.

766
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:30.562

00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:32.063

768
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.481
And not just for a kid.

769
00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:35.608
She's only 10 and
knows her guitars.

770
00:29:35.692 --> 00:29:37.777
It's so impressive.

771
00:29:37.902 --> 00:29:39.195
So when do we get to meet her?

772
00:29:39.362 --> 00:29:40.739
Ah!

773
00:29:40.864 --> 00:29:41.281
Can we come to the
school with you?

774
00:29:41.364 --> 00:29:42.365
No.

775
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:43.491
No. no. no.

776
00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:44.743
I don't even know if I'm going.

777
00:29:44.868 --> 00:29:46.828
Why wouldn't you go?

778
00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:49.205
Because she wants me to talk
about being a famous musician.

779
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.665
What am I supposed to say?

780
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.292
I don't want to disappoint her.

781
00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:55.420
Mijo. we never feel like
the people we wanna be.

782
00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:56.379
especially as parents.

783
00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:57.589

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:03.595
Yeah. but--

786
00:30:03.678 --> 00:30:05.096
I'm not a parent.

Why it doesn't make me wanna run

793
00:30:43.218 --> 00:30:49.599
I was just a rolling stone

Till you gave me somewhere to go

You saved my soul when
you made my heart a home.

Hey. Dad.

798
00:31:11.663 --> 00:31:12.747
Need some help?

799
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:13.498
Sure.

800
00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:14.541
Yeah.

801
00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:15.917
Why are you here?

802
00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:17.585
Shouldn't you be
at Ruby's school?

803
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:19.546
I'm not going.

804
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:21.423
OK.

00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:23.133
What's going on?

806
00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:26.678
[sighs] It's just.
I always wanted

807
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:30.724
to be a dad. but I didn't think
this is how it was gonna happen.

808
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:31.474
And I'm not even a dad.

809
00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:34.436
I mean. I'm a donor.

810
00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:36.521
And I don't know if I
should get attached.

811
00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:37.689
Imagine how Ruby feels.

812
00:31:37.772 --> 00:31:40.316
Yeah. I know.

813
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.236
Mijo. even in the
simplest of circumstances.

814
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:45.655
parenting is never what
we think it will be.

815
00:31:45.739 --> 00:31:49.409
And every parent worries
if they can give enough.

816
00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:55.790
If they aren't. the kids
don't see it like that.

817
00:31:55.915 --> 00:31:58.209
They just want to be loved.

818
00:31:58.335 --> 00:32:00.670
I don't even know
if Amelia is gonna let

819
00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:01.921
me see her again after this?

00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:03.673

of it while you have it.

Sorry for the grand entrance.

00:33:13.076 --> 00:33:17.664
[chuckles] I'm here with Ruby.

841
00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:19.249
Did I miss my turn?

842
00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:21.292
MISS WEAVER: You're
actually right on time.

843
00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:23.336
But I'm-- I'm just a little
confused because I only had Ms.

845
00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:25.588

00:33:25.755 --> 00:33:26.464
OK.

Hello.

Uh. I'm TJ Cruz.

00:33:32.804 --> 00:33:35.640
I'm Ruby's friend.

850
00:33:35.724 --> 00:33:41.271
And I'm here to talk about
heritage. which. I think.

851
00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:43.732
it's not just a big word.

852
00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:46.609
It's a big responsibility.

853
00:33:46.693 --> 00:33:51.197
Because it's not just about
where you're from or who

854
00:33:51.322 --> 00:33:55.452
you are. but it's about
connection. and integrity.

855
00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:57.495
and values.

856
00:33:57.662 --> 00:34:01.666
And it doesn't matter what
country you were born in.

857
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.627
but if you pass those three
things to the ones you love.

858
00:34:04.794 --> 00:34:07.714
you can create a family history
that you can be proud of.

859
00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:10.800
So make your families proud.

00:34:10.884 --> 00:34:14.012

861
00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:18.516
You can't do that again. TJ.

862
00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:19.434
Do what?

863
00:34:19.559 --> 00:34:20.477
Flip-flop on her.

864
00:34:20.602 --> 00:34:21.686
You can't.

865
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.521
But I called you.

866
00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:25.065
I left a message. and it
went to-- to voicemail.

867
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.733
Because I had my
phone turned off

868
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.861
because I was here already
setting up for the presentation.

869
00:34:30.028 --> 00:34:30.653
I'm sorry.

870
00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:32.530
I'm sorry.

871
00:34:32.697 --> 00:34:36.409
Ruby was devastated when
you decided not to come.

872
00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:38.411
You can't just say you're
gonna do one thing.

873
00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:39.871
and then change your
mind at the last second.

874
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:41.539
You cannot.
- I don't know what else to say.

875
00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:43.917
I messed up.

876
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.960
And I do that a lot. and I
probably sounded like an idiot.

877
00:34:46.044 --> 00:34:47.087
You didn't sound
like an idiot.

878
00:34:47.212 --> 00:34:49.756
You sounded great.

879
00:34:49.923 --> 00:34:54.260
It-- what you said. it was
moving and it was poignant.

880
00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:57.013
But words aren't enough.

881
00:34:57.097 --> 00:34:59.849
Kids need consistency
and reliability.

882
00:35:00.016 --> 00:35:01.810
And they need to
know if they can

883
00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:05.021
count on us or if they can't.

884
00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:07.315
So if you wanna
be in Ruby's life.

885
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.819
you just-- you need to ask
yourself. can she count on you?

[dramatic music]

887
00:35:32.007 --> 00:35:32.716

891
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.390
this land for a subdivision.

892
00:35:40.515 --> 00:35:42.392
OK?

893
00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:46.521
50 or so houses. all green.
and I wanna pitch for it.

894
00:35:46.688 --> 00:35:47.897
Ah. no.

895
00:35:48.064 --> 00:35:49.357
I don't think we're
ready for that.

896
00:35:49.524 --> 00:35:50.525
Imagine what it could
mean for our firm.

897
00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:52.235
Yeah.

898
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.154
It could mean more staff
and resources. financing

899
00:35:54.237 --> 00:35:55.655
that we don't have. and time.

900
00:35:55.739 --> 00:35:56.990
We don't have to
figure any of it out.

901
00:35:57.157 --> 00:35:58.116
So we hire a consultant.

902
00:35:58.283 --> 00:35:58.992
It's fine.

903
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:00.201
We do whatever it takes.

904
00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:01.911
What we have
right now is good.

905
00:36:02.078 --> 00:36:04.122
Yeah. but expanding
could be better.

906
00:36:04.247 --> 00:36:05.665
What is wrong
with what we have?

907
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:07.417
Are you unhappy?

908
00:36:07.542 --> 00:36:09.544
Why is everyone always
wanna expand all the time?

909
00:36:09.711 --> 00:36:13.798
What is wrong with staying
as we are when it works?

910
00:36:13.882 --> 00:36:17.427
I kind of feel like we're not
talking about the deal anymore.

911
00:36:17.552 --> 00:36:20.513
Amelia. is this about
Ruby and the rock star?

912
00:36:20.597 --> 00:36:23.058
Her expanding family
tree. it's killing me.

913
00:36:23.141 --> 00:36:25.185
Are you sure this
isn't good expansion?

914
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.603
Can you just be on my side?

915
00:36:26.686 --> 00:36:28.730
I am on your side.

916
00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:31.441
I want what's best
for you and us.

917
00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:35.195
And I want us to pitch.
so grow or stagnate.

918
00:36:35.362 --> 00:36:36.863
I can make either choice?

919
00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:40.784
[chuckles] Can you
trust me on this?

920
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.703
[somber music]

921
00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:47.123
[light music]

922
00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:00.428
Perfect.
I love it.

923
00:37:00.553 --> 00:37:01.930
TJ: Thank you.

924
00:37:02.013 --> 00:37:04.057
Also. I wanted to
ask about the tour.

925
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.476
Are you auditioning
for lead guitar. maybe?

926
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:08.687
You know we love
you. TJ. but Romer

927
00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:09.979
always plays lead for Sadie.

928
00:37:10.063 --> 00:37:12.190
Of course.

929
00:37:12.357 --> 00:37:16.736
Well. uh. would you bounce
me a copy once it's mixed?

930
00:37:16.903 --> 00:37:20.865
I wanna show it to my. uh--

931
00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:21.825
a young artist I know.

932
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:23.326
Of course.

933
00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:24.661
Thanks.

934
00:37:24.828 --> 00:37:28.164
[light music]

935
00:37:31.001 --> 00:37:31.543
So Amelia.

936
00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:32.669
Mm-hmm?

937
00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:33.878
These are TJ's sisters.

938
00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:35.630
Oh!

939
00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:37.465
His older sister.
Bianca. and his two younger

940
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.259
sisters. Camila and Elena.

941
00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:40.218
Nice to meet you.

942
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:41.553
Thank you for coming.

943
00:37:41.678 --> 00:37:43.138
I hope mom didn't
pressure you into.

944
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:45.098
Oh. no. no. no.
no. it's my pleasure.

945
00:37:45.223 --> 00:37:47.142
So tell us all about you.

946
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.560
We heard you don't
have any family.

947
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:49.936
- Mom!
- Boundaries.

948
00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:52.272
Boundaries aren't for family.

949
00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:53.857
Please forgive our mother.

950
00:37:54.024 --> 00:37:55.025
No. it's fine.

951
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:56.901
Really.

952
00:37:56.985 --> 00:37:58.695
But I do have family.

953
00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:00.155
Ruby and I are a family.

954
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.574
Of course.

955
00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:04.784
So Amelia. you are an architect?

956
00:38:04.868 --> 00:38:05.827
Yeah.

957
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.370
Yeah. yeah.

958
00:38:07.495 --> 00:38:08.788
It's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

959
00:38:08.872 --> 00:38:10.749
Other little girls had
Barbies. I had a spirograph.

960
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:14.044
[laughs] And what
do you like about it?

961
00:38:14.127 --> 00:38:19.132
I like feeling like I'm
giving people a sense of home.

962
00:38:19.299 --> 00:38:21.092
I think we all just wanna
find our place in the world.

963
00:38:21.259 --> 00:38:22.177
you know?

964
00:38:22.344 --> 00:38:23.845
You should tell that to TJ.

965
00:38:23.928 --> 00:38:26.222
You know. he spent most
of his youth in Mexico.

966
00:38:26.306 --> 00:38:28.641
But then with the band
and the traveling. I mean.

967
00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:29.684
you just never know
where he's going.

968
00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:30.727
Mommy. OK.

969
00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:31.436
That's enough.

970
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:33.188
Let her breathe.

971
00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:36.983
Amelia. my grandson.
Mateo. turns nine next week.

972
00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:38.693
That's my son.

973
00:38:38.818 --> 00:38:42.238
SOFIA: And we are going
to have a little fiesta.

974
00:38:42.364 --> 00:38:44.366
We would so love if you
and Ruby would join us.

975
00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:46.493
Oh. Mateo would love that.

976
00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:47.827
There's gonna be so much food.
SOFIA: And so many other kids.

977
00:38:47.994 --> 00:38:49.204
And music!

978
00:38:49.371 --> 00:38:50.080
- So. it's a yes?
- Yes.

979
00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:51.498
It's going to be so fun.

980
00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:52.999
We'll all be there.

981
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:56.002
[light music]

982
00:38:57.712 --> 00:39:02.967
(SINGING) Boo-ooh
Something about you

983
00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:04.177
That caught your eye

984
00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:06.221
And got a glimpse

985
00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:08.098
Of what heaven must be like

986
00:39:08.181 --> 00:39:10.850
You got me in a spin

987
00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:13.937
I can't help wonder
where you've been

988
00:39:14.104 --> 00:39:16.773
It's never been with me

989
00:39:16.856 --> 00:39:19.401
I wanna be with you. girl.

990
00:39:27.033 --> 00:39:32.622
So are you better at music
or artisanal southwest cuisine?

991
00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:34.582
Ah. you can be
the judge of that.

992
00:39:34.749 --> 00:39:35.625
AMELIA: Oh.

993
00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:37.002
Just one second.

994
00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:40.255
OK.

995
00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:42.590
Ah. I brought this in today.

996
00:39:42.757 --> 00:39:45.802
Roasted squash blossoms with
ricotta cheese and poblanos.

997
00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:46.720
AMELIA: You made this?

998
00:39:46.803 --> 00:39:47.512
Yeah.

999
00:39:47.637 --> 00:39:48.304
Tell me what you think.

1000
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.227
Oh.

1001
00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:55.270
You know. it's really good.

1002
00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:57.063
OK.

1003
00:39:57.147 --> 00:39:58.690
No. this is-- this is
too hard because you are

1004
00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:01.192
an incredible guitarist.
but I actually think this

1005
00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:02.736
might be your true calling.

1006
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:03.737
- Do you like to cook?
- [laughs] I don't know.

1007
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:05.947
Sort-- no.

1008
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:07.991
I-- I'm usually too exhausted
by the end of the day

1009
00:40:08.074 --> 00:40:09.576
to do anything fancy.

1010
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:10.952
Yeah. it must be hard
being a single parent.

1011
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.662
Mm.

1012
00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:14.789
It's hard being
any kind of parent.

1013
00:40:14.914 --> 00:40:16.166
What about you?

1014
00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:17.083
Do you want kids?

1015
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:19.210
Yeah. in theory.

1016
00:40:19.377 --> 00:40:23.173
Um. but with my career. I
could be on tour for six months

1017
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.551
a year. so it's hard to
reconcile that with kids.

1018
00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:28.511
Yeah.

1019
00:40:28.636 --> 00:40:31.264
But. as an uncle. I
get the general idea.

1020
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:33.391
I teach them a little guitar.

1021
00:40:33.516 --> 00:40:35.185
I make waffles for them.

1022
00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:36.311
Tell them jokes.
- Yeah.

1023
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:37.562
That's all there
is to parenting.

1024
00:40:37.687 --> 00:40:39.606
Just waffle-making
and joke-telling.

1025
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.774
- What else?
- Yeah.

1026
00:40:40.857 --> 00:40:41.483
Nothing else.

1027
00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:42.192
That's it.

1028
00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:43.693
Yeah. I know.

1029
00:40:43.818 --> 00:40:47.072
Ah. when I envisioned
my life. I--

1030
00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:52.118
I always thought. make it as a
musician. and kids and marriage.

1031
00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:52.952
second.

1032
00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:57.707
May I ask you--

1033
00:41:00.627 --> 00:41:03.213
why did you do IVF?

1034
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.924
And you can tell me it's
none of my business.

1035
00:41:06.007 --> 00:41:07.592
It's none of your business.

1036
00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:08.802
Got it.

1037
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:09.552
That's all right.

1038
00:41:09.678 --> 00:41:11.888
Why did you donate?

1039
00:41:12.013 --> 00:41:13.848
I was young.

1040
00:41:14.015 --> 00:41:16.184
And I had been living
in Mexico with my uncle.

1041
00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:19.187
So when I came back to
the States. I was broke.

1042
00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:20.397
I didn't want to
rely on my parents.

1043
00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:22.607
So that's it.

1044
00:41:22.732 --> 00:41:23.400
Simple as that.

1045
00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:27.987
I actually wanted to talk
to you about something.

1046
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:30.156
Yeah. what is it?

1047
00:41:30.323 --> 00:41:34.369
I wanted to explain why I
was so intense and sensitive

1048
00:41:34.536 --> 00:41:35.620
the other day at Ruby's school.

1049
00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.205
My dad just wasn't there for me.

1050
00:41:37.288 --> 00:41:38.790
He made a lot of promises
he couldn't keep.

1051
00:41:38.957 --> 00:41:39.958
It was just-- it was hard.

1052
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.710
So we'll just leave it at that.

1053
00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:44.713
Um. I just don't want
Ruby to ever have to go

1054
00:41:44.838 --> 00:41:45.630
through anything like that.

1055
00:41:45.755 --> 00:41:46.923
Yeah.

1056
00:41:47.007 --> 00:41:48.049
- Yeah.
- Understood.

1057
00:41:48.133 --> 00:41:48.758
OK. yeah.

1058
00:41:48.883 --> 00:41:50.677
Yeah.

1059
00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:53.805
And I think you should
take this to Ruby so you

1060
00:41:53.972 --> 00:41:54.889
don't have to cook tonight.

1061
00:41:55.056 --> 00:41:56.307
Really?

1062
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:58.143
Um. do I have to share?

1063
00:41:58.226 --> 00:41:59.519
Because you know
what. I could just

1064
00:41:59.602 --> 00:42:01.062
like make her some
mac and cheese.

1065
00:42:01.229 --> 00:42:03.023
and then this could
be our little secret.

1066
00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:05.358
You can do whatever you want.

1067
00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:07.569
It is up to me
because I'm the mama.

1068
00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:09.612
Can I-- can I
show you something.

1069
00:42:09.738 --> 00:42:10.864
a song I've been working on?

1070
00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:11.656
Oh. yeah.
No.

1071
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:12.490
OK.
- Yeah?

1072
00:42:12.657 --> 00:42:14.284
Sure.
I would love to.

1073
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:17.162
It's. um. you know. it
came to me late last night.

1074
00:42:17.245 --> 00:42:19.039
And I want a fresh set of ears.

1075
00:42:19.205 --> 00:42:20.206
AMELIA: OK.
- First impression.

1076
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:20.957
Hit me.

1077
00:42:21.082 --> 00:42:22.584
OK.

1078
00:42:22.709 --> 00:42:25.628
[humming]

1079
00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:44.439
(SINGING) Ooh.
ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh

1080
00:42:44.522 --> 00:42:48.860
Something about you
that caught your eye

1081
00:42:48.985 --> 00:42:52.364
And got a glimpse of
what heaven must be like

1082
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.241
You got me in a spin

1083
00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:58.536
I can't help wonder
where you've been

1084
00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.164
It's never been with me

1085
00:43:01.247 --> 00:43:03.667
I wanna be with you. girl.

1086
00:43:11.925 --> 00:43:15.261
[lively music]

1087
00:43:30.068 --> 00:43:31.945
Whoa!

1088
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.655
Wow!

1089
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.739
[sighs] Oh.

1090
00:43:34.864 --> 00:43:37.200
Here she goes.

1091
00:43:37.283 --> 00:43:37.992
- How are you?
- Good.

1092
00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:38.952
Good?

1093
00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:41.246
That's TJ.

1094
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:43.248
I mean. you said
he was smoldering.

1095
00:43:43.331 --> 00:43:44.958
but he is smoldering.

1096
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:46.626
Did you mean to tell me
that there is not a shred

1097
00:43:46.793 --> 00:43:48.753
of romantic fantasy here?

1098
00:43:48.878 --> 00:43:52.173
My deep romantic fantasy is
someone to do the dishes with.

1099
00:43:52.257 --> 00:43:54.843
You know. ordinarily. I
would say that's really sad.

1100
00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:56.886
But I would gladly do
the dishes with that man.

1101
00:43:57.053 --> 00:43:59.848
OK. settle down.

1102
00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:00.598
OK.

1103
00:44:00.765 --> 00:44:02.559
[chattering]

1104
00:44:02.684 --> 00:44:03.893
Hi.

1105
00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:05.937
Hi.

1106
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.899
Ah.

1107
00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:12.944
I am so happy you came.

1108
00:44:13.028 --> 00:44:17.032
[chuckles] Oh!

1109
00:44:17.115 --> 00:44:19.993
And you must be Ruby.

1110
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.370
I am your--

1111
00:44:22.537 --> 00:44:23.371
Sofia.

1112
00:44:23.455 --> 00:44:26.291
Call me Tia Sofia.

1113
00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:28.043
Nice to meet you. Tia Sofia.

1114
00:44:28.209 --> 00:44:29.627
Nice to meet you.

1115
00:44:29.753 --> 00:44:31.838
My mom says that
whenever you return a dish.

1116
00:44:31.963 --> 00:44:33.798
you should put something in it.

1117
00:44:33.923 --> 00:44:35.759
So I cooked you my favorite.

1118
00:44:35.884 --> 00:44:37.635
Ants on a log!

1119
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:39.220
I hope they're
made with real ants.

1121
00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:41.097
I'm Tomas.

1122
00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:42.265
I'm TJ's father.

1123
00:44:42.432 --> 00:44:44.225
Nice to meet you.

1124
00:44:44.392 --> 00:44:46.019
And this is my best friend
and business partner. Maura.

1125
00:44:46.144 --> 00:44:47.354
And my Auntie.

1126
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.897
Aw!

1127
00:44:49.022 --> 00:44:50.023
Oh.

1129
00:44:51.483 --> 00:44:53.068
Hi. are you Ruby?

1130
00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:54.402
I'm Mateo. your cousin.

1131
00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:55.528
Whoa.

1132
00:44:55.695 --> 00:44:57.280
I've never had a cousin before.

1133
00:44:57.364 --> 00:44:58.782
Hey. you wanna hit the piñata?

1134
00:44:58.907 --> 00:44:59.574
Can I?

1135
00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:00.700
Yeah. sure.

1136
00:45:00.867 --> 00:45:01.659
Just stay where I can see you.

1137
00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:03.620
You better count me in.

1138
00:45:03.745 --> 00:45:06.122
Please. make yourself at home.

1139
00:45:06.247 --> 00:45:09.751
[festive music]

1140
00:45:35.568 --> 00:45:36.945
Can I help you with that?

1141
00:45:37.112 --> 00:45:39.114
Uh-- uh. sorry.

1142
00:45:39.197 --> 00:45:42.951
No. I have a strict "open my own
bottles and jars" philosophy.

1143
00:45:43.118 --> 00:45:45.870
My mama always said learn
to do everything yourself

1144
00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:49.040
in case you don't
have money or a man.

1145
00:45:49.165 --> 00:45:50.375
- That's a big thought.
- Yeah. well--

1146
00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:51.376
Yeah.

1147
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:52.460
Uh. it's actually--

1148
00:45:52.627 --> 00:45:53.378
What--

1149
00:45:56.256 --> 00:45:57.215
It's a twist up.

1150
00:45:57.298 --> 00:46:00.552
Of course it is.

1151
00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:03.179
OK. I'm gonna go do a lap.

1152
00:46:03.263 --> 00:46:05.807
See if I can find my girls.

1153
00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:07.684
I don't know why I
said it like that.

1154
00:46:07.809 --> 00:46:09.102
See you later.
- I hope so.

1155
00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:09.894
OK. bye.

1156
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.770
Bye.

1157
00:46:19.195 --> 00:46:21.031
Strange. huh?

1158
00:46:21.156 --> 00:46:23.616
You have a kid. and
your heart goes walking

1159
00:46:23.783 --> 00:46:25.869
around outside of your chest.

1160
00:46:25.994 --> 00:46:28.371
There's nowhere else
you'd rather be.

1161
00:46:28.455 --> 00:46:31.207
I've heard that said
before. but only now

1162
00:46:31.374 --> 00:46:32.792
I'm beginning to understand.

1163
00:46:44.012 --> 00:46:45.513
TJ was so moody
as a kid. especially

1164
00:46:45.597 --> 00:46:46.514
when he was playing music.

1165
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:48.099
Well. he's a creative.

1166
00:46:48.266 --> 00:46:49.809
But. anyway.
let's give these two

1167
00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:51.686
a chance to eat before
the tias descend on them.

1168
00:46:51.853 --> 00:46:53.229
You know. I have
been warned about them.

1169
00:46:53.355 --> 00:46:54.022
Yeah.

1170
00:46:54.147 --> 00:46:55.982
No.

1171
00:46:56.149 --> 00:46:57.359
No warning could possibly
suffice. but suerte.

00:46:57.525 --> 00:46:58.151
[laughs]

1173
00:46:58.318 --> 00:47:00.487
Come on.

1174
00:47:00.653 --> 00:47:01.905
I'm so glad you guys are here.

1175
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.990
Thank you.

1176

Aah.

1177
00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:06.576
They seem so sweet.

1178
00:47:06.743 --> 00:47:08.620
They're so sweet.

1179
00:47:08.787 --> 00:47:10.747
They're so-- so kind and so
friendly. and nice. and warm.

1180
00:47:10.872 --> 00:47:12.499
and chatty. like so so chatty.

I feel like I'm sweating.
Am I sweating?

1182
00:47:14.417 --> 00:47:15.835
I think it's the
salsa. actually.

1183
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.212
Did you know this
is the mild one?

1184
00:47:17.295 --> 00:47:18.672
It's the mild one.

1185
00:47:18.755 --> 00:47:20.298
I think you could
use a breather. OK?

1186
00:47:20.382 --> 00:47:21.800
Don't worry. I'll keep an
eye on Ruby. all right?

1187
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.134
Thank you very much.
OK.

1188
00:47:23.218 --> 00:47:24.803
You're welcome.

1189
00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:26.346
Don't mind if I do.

[whimsical music]

1191
00:48:04.175 --> 00:48:05.719
Sorry to interrupt.

1192
00:48:05.885 --> 00:48:06.970
I just wanted to check on you.

1193
00:48:07.095 --> 00:48:09.681
My family can be a lot.

1194
00:48:09.764 --> 00:48:11.725
No. no. no. they're so great.

1195
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.977
I-- I'm just not used to it.

1196
00:48:14.102 --> 00:48:19.149
My family situation was. and
is. entirely the opposite.

1197
00:48:19.274 --> 00:48:21.776
It's me and my mom.
and then me and Ruby.

1198
00:48:24.612 --> 00:48:25.447
But they are a lot.

1199
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.156
It's a lot.

1200
00:48:26.281 --> 00:48:26.990
It's-- sorry.

1201
00:48:27.115 --> 00:48:29.034
[both laughing]

1202
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:30.160
Do you mind if I join you?

1203
00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:31.161
I need a party break.

1204
00:48:31.286 --> 00:48:32.454
Yeah.

1205
00:48:32.537 --> 00:48:34.622
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1206
00:48:34.706 --> 00:48:36.458
What were you doing?

1207
00:48:36.541 --> 00:48:38.460
Cloud gazing?

1208
00:48:38.543 --> 00:48:39.252
Guess we are now.

1209
00:48:39.419 --> 00:48:39.878
Yeah.

1210
00:48:42.547 --> 00:48:45.133
That one looks like
a dog with a banjo.

1211
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.552
AMELIA: A banjo?

1212
00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:49.971
You see that level of
detail right there?

1213
00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:52.015
It's not like a
guitar or a ukulele.

1214
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.391
Nah. it's definitely a banjo.

1215
00:48:53.475 --> 00:48:54.184
Banjo?
OK.

1216
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.934
Yeah.

1217
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:55.935
All right.

1218
00:48:56.061 --> 00:48:58.980
[chuckling]

1219
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.195
You asked me why I did IVF.

1220
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.613
Yeah. you told me to
mind my own business.

1221
00:49:06.696 --> 00:49:07.906
Yes. I did.

1222
00:49:07.989 --> 00:49:09.657
But I'm now ready
to tell you why.

1223
00:49:09.741 --> 00:49:11.117
Would you like to hear it?

1224
00:49:11.284 --> 00:49:11.993
Sure.

1225
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:22.671
[sighs] Because more than
anything. I wanted to be a mom.

1226
00:49:22.754 --> 00:49:28.885
And I got to a certain age and
hadn't met anyone yet. so I

1227
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:29.969
didn't wanna wait any longer.

1228
00:49:33.723 --> 00:49:35.350
I could feel Ruby.

1229
00:49:38.436 --> 00:49:39.938
I was like waiting
for my life to start.

1230
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.571
You can honestly see an elephant
playing a banjo right there?

1231
00:49:48.738 --> 00:49:50.532
No. it's a dog
playing a banjo.

1232
00:49:50.615 --> 00:49:51.700
A dog-- that's a dog?

1233
00:49:51.783 --> 00:49:52.534
Right there. that's--

1234
00:49:52.617 --> 00:49:55.787
No. that's a dog.

1235
00:49:55.954 --> 00:49:59.165
That's a-- That's a dog.

1236
00:49:59.332 --> 00:50:00.041
Yeah.

1237
00:50:06.423 --> 00:50:07.799
Shall we get back to the--

1238
00:50:07.924 --> 00:50:08.508
do you wanna go?
- Yep.

1239
00:50:08.675 --> 00:50:09.342
OK.

1240
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:12.637
Let's do that.

1241
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:14.139
Yeah.

1242
00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:15.181
Oh.

1243
00:50:15.306 --> 00:50:16.683
Name of my-- what made it.

1244
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.935
Hey.

1245
00:50:19.019 --> 00:50:20.979
There are so many people you
need to meet. and some of them

1246
00:50:21.062 --> 00:50:22.897
ask really personal questions.

1247
00:50:23.064 --> 00:50:25.150
Yeah. they do.

1248
00:50:25.275 --> 00:50:27.360
Would you like to accompany me
on guitar for happy birthday?

1249
00:50:27.485 --> 00:50:29.195
I'll go grab Baby Taylor.

1250
00:50:29.362 --> 00:50:31.281
Thanks.

1251
00:50:31.406 --> 00:50:33.616
Oh. and I made you this.

1252
00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:36.911
So if you ever get worried
about how you're gonna play.

1253
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:38.913
it'll remind you to
just do your version.

1254

[melancholic music]

1255
00:50:43.793 --> 00:50:44.711
I love it.

1256
00:50:44.794 --> 00:50:45.670
Thank you.

[singing in spanish]

1258
00:51:04.689 --> 00:51:05.315
Yay!

1259
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.777
[applause]

1260
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:12.280
So not a shred of fantasy?

1261
00:51:20.747 --> 00:51:21.956
MAN: We love the renderings.

1262
00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:23.208
Love your pitch.

1263
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:25.251
Love your firm.

1264
00:51:25.377 --> 00:51:27.921
But a subdivision is a big
jump from single-family builds.

1265
00:51:28.004 --> 00:51:30.382
And we have concerns about

There's no one
more local than me.

1445
00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:50.905
Let's hear it.

1446
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.258
Uh. I'm I'm digging what you're
doing. but it's a little dry.

1447
00:59:10.342 --> 00:59:12.135
Where's the guy I heard
at the guitar shop?

1448
00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:20.685
Yep.

1449
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:21.353
You got it.

1450
00:59:25.982 --> 00:59:28.985
[playing guitar]

1451
01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:04.896
Are you here for the
samples or the company?

1452
01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:07.107
Can it be both?

1453
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.899
Roasted root vegetables?

1454
01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:08.817
Yes. please.

1455
01:00:12.487 --> 01:00:14.072
Oh.

1456
01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:16.282
I'm telling you. if the
music doesn't work out.

1457
01:00:16.366 --> 01:00:18.118
you got a real future here.

1458
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:19.577
Oh.

1459
01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:20.870
Music is totally
gonna work out. though.

1460
01:00:20.995 --> 01:00:23.540
That-- what?

1461
01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:26.084
That is the perfect thing
to say to a struggling

1462
01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:28.003
artist in a gig economy.

1463
01:00:28.086 --> 01:00:30.547
I'm-- I'm saying is that.
you know. whatever you do.

1464
01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.882
it's gonna be great stuff.

1465
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.883
I am gonna be great.

1466
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.468
OK.

1467
01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:39.806
Hey. how are you doing?

1468
01:00:39.931 --> 01:00:43.435
Are we gonna go there
several times over?

1469
01:00:43.518 --> 01:00:44.269
You don't have to.

1470
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:53.695
Well. um. I think
you're wonderful.

1471
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.156
Ruby obviously loves you.

1472
01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:57.574
And why do I get
the sense that you

1473
01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:00.952
can stop this at any minute?

1474
01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:03.913
I told you about my dad
leaving when I was little.

1475
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.124
Yeah.

1476
01:01:06.207 --> 01:01:09.377
Well. then. he spent my
childhood popping in and out.

1477
01:01:09.502 --> 01:01:11.796
And I remember what
that felt like.

1478
01:01:11.921 --> 01:01:14.716
the waiting and the
hoping. and then

1479
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.176
the crushing disappointment.

1480
01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:19.054
And I don't want Ruby
to ever feel that.

1481
01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:21.598
and I'm still just
trying to figure out

1482
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:23.433
if she can really count on you.

1483
01:01:28.563 --> 01:01:30.648
Let me cook for you--

1484
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:31.941
tonight.

1485
01:01:32.108 --> 01:01:33.151
What?

1486
01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:34.694
Yeah. I can--

1487
01:01:34.819 --> 01:01:38.114
I can teach Ruby my
mom's favorite recipe.

1488
01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:39.616
Unless you're too busy
with your new gig.

1489
01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:40.825
No.

1490
01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:42.535
No. I'm not-- I just--

1491
01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:43.661
this would be good.

1492
01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:44.329
That would be nice.

1493
01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:45.830
4:00 PM.

1494
01:01:45.955 --> 01:01:47.665
That is not a
normal dinner time.

1495
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.376
I'm cooking birria.

1496
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:50.460
It takes a long time.

1497
01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.379
OK.

1498
01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:53.171
What can I pick up?

1499
01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:53.963
Nothing.

1500
01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:55.090
Just go. go.

1501
01:01:55.173 --> 01:01:56.174
Shoo.

1502
01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:56.966
OK. I got you.

1503
01:01:57.133 --> 01:01:58.343
I'll go.

1504
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.720
And stop eating.

1505
01:02:00.845 --> 01:02:02.097
Excuse me?

1506
01:02:02.263 --> 01:02:03.473
You need to be
hungry for tonight.

1507
01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:04.307
OK.

1508
01:02:08.144 --> 01:02:10.939
[light music]

1509
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.195
OK.

1510
01:02:17.278 --> 01:02:20.156
See how they've softened?

1511
01:02:20.323 --> 01:02:23.952
Now. put them here.

1512
01:02:24.035 --> 01:02:28.540
But also. we're gonna
blend them with some broth.

1513
01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:30.583
AMELIA: That smells so good.

1514
01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:31.334
I could do it!

1515
01:02:31.418 --> 01:02:32.460
No. no. no.

1516
01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:33.878
She need the top first. Riffs.

1517
01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:35.005
And I'm not done yet.

1518
01:02:35.171 --> 01:02:36.423
Riffs?

1519
01:02:36.506 --> 01:02:37.298
Like on the guitar?

1520
01:02:37.465 --> 01:02:38.758
It's TJ's nickname for me.

1521
01:02:38.883 --> 01:02:40.093
He's workshopping it.

1522
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.886
How about Riff Van Winkle?

1523
01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:43.304
Hmm.

1524
01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:44.723
No. let's keep brainstorming.

1525
01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:46.725
Do you make food
like this every night?

1526
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.601
Yeah. I like cooking.

1527
01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:50.895
It's a way for me to take
care of the people I love.

1528
01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:51.938
And myself. of course.

1529
01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:53.273
Hey. Mom.

1530
01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:55.025
Hey. TJ. can teach
you how to cook.

1531
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:57.027
Excuse me?

1532
01:02:57.152 --> 01:02:59.779
I make a mean mac and
cheese. thank you very much.

1533
01:02:59.904 --> 01:03:02.824
Don't tell me it's from a box.

1534
01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:05.785
All right. Riffie
Longstocking. go for it.

1535
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.495
[machine whirring]

1536
01:03:07.662 --> 01:03:09.497
Riffie Longstocking.
I like that.

1537
01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:12.250
That's-- that's good.

1538
01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:14.753
All right. are you ready?

1539
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.254
My goodness.

1540
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:18.256
I hope you like it.

1541
01:03:18.423 --> 01:03:20.967
This looks so succulent.

1542
01:03:21.092 --> 01:03:22.260
Word of the day?

1543
01:03:22.344 --> 01:03:23.053
Did I use it right?

1544
01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:23.803
Oh. yeah.

1545
01:03:23.928 --> 01:03:25.722
Then yes.

1546
01:03:25.847 --> 01:03:29.267
OK. this is the perfect
way to celebrate my big news.

1547
01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:34.230
I got a gig playing lead guitar
for Trey Stasio next Thursday.

1548
01:03:34.397 --> 01:03:35.648
Trey Stasio?

1549
01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.442
I love Trey Stasio!

1550
01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:39.402
And you probably know
his music better than I do.

1551
01:03:39.569 --> 01:03:41.488
Anyway. it's a small
venue for Trey.

1552
01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:44.407
but it's a friends and family
kickoff night before the tour.

1553
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:47.160
And it's all thanks to Ruby
because I was with Ruby

1554
01:03:47.285 --> 01:03:49.496
when I met Trey's manager
at the guitar store.

1555
01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:52.749
That is so exciting.

1556
01:03:52.874 --> 01:03:53.667
Congrats.

1557
01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:55.794
TJ: Thank you.

1558
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.462
And if you're free that night.
I have a couple of VIP tickets

1559
01:03:57.629 --> 01:03:58.546
with your names on them.

1560
01:03:58.713 --> 01:04:01.132
Trey Stasio knows my name?

1561
01:04:01.299 --> 01:04:03.551
[laughs] That's not exactly
how that works. honey.

1562
01:04:03.677 --> 01:04:05.553
But there are
backstage passes. so I

1563
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.514
might be able to introduce you.

1564
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:09.099
Can we. Mom?

1565
01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:10.308
We're VIPs.

1566
01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:11.101
We have to.
- Yes!

1567
01:04:11.267 --> 01:04:11.768
Yes!

1568
01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:14.938
Yes!

1569
01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:17.148
I always like to give
Thanks before I eat.

1570
01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:17.982
Is that OK?

1571
01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:26.324
Thank you for our
food. our safety.

1572
01:04:26.408 --> 01:04:31.663
and thank you for bringing
Amelia and Ruby into my life.

1573
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.956
Amen.

1574
01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:33.665
Amen.

1575
01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:35.333
Amen.

1576
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.335
TJ: OK. this is how
you eat a birria taco.

1577
01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:40.755
You open it up. and you put
just a little bit of meat.

1578
01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.632
We don't wanna
overflow it. right?

1579
01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:43.466
No.

1580
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.300
OK.

1581
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:51.850
The leftover birria should
last you a week. easy.

1582
01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:53.476
As you can see. I go
all out when I cook.

1583
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.103
As you can see. I
go all out when I eat.

1584
01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:56.646
So that works out.

1585
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:59.149
[laughs] Hey. I got
a question for you.

1586
01:04:59.315 --> 01:05:00.442
Hit me.

1587
01:05:00.525 --> 01:05:02.527
So you know.
the whole Heritage

1588
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:06.448
Day debacle. you know. you
weren't gonna come. and then--

1589
01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:10.910
and then you did.

1590
01:05:11.036 --> 01:05:12.287
What changed?

1591
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.372
Some great advice
my dad gave me.

1592
01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:16.374
Which was?

1593
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:20.628
I shouldn't worry if Ruby's
not in my life long-term.

1594
01:05:20.795 --> 01:05:24.299
But if I only get one day
with her. I should take it.

1595
01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:25.342
So I did.

1596
01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:31.514
I really hope we
can keep this going.

1597
01:05:31.681 --> 01:05:34.100
even if it's one day at a time.

1598
01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:36.144
I'm pretty good at a
few things like playing

1599
01:05:36.227 --> 01:05:39.689
the guitar. cooking.
my family. but I know

1600
01:05:39.856 --> 01:05:41.566
I could be great as a father.

1601
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.906
And of course. you and I could
spend more time together.

1602
01:05:51.117 --> 01:05:56.122
Wouldn't that make this
a little complicated?

1603
01:05:56.247 --> 01:05:57.582
Some would call it conundrum.

1604
01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:21.439
One day at a time?

1605
01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:22.190
That's all I'm asking.

1606
01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:37.622
TJ: Trey. how are you. man?

1607
01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:40.083
TREY: Good to meet you. TJ.

1608
01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:41.167
Woo!

1609
01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:42.669
Home sweet home.

1610
01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.338
It still smells the same.

1611
01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:48.800
All right. so we'll do a
quick sound check at 4:00 PM.

1612
01:06:48.883 --> 01:06:50.927
Doors open at 7:00 PM.

1613
01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:52.929
Show starts at 8:00.

1614
01:06:53.054 --> 01:06:56.766
We'll have an hour set.
half-hour intermission.

1615
01:06:56.933 --> 01:07:00.061
another hour set. and
then a 15-minute encore.

1616
01:07:00.186 --> 01:07:01.354
I think that's it.

1617
01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:02.897
Any questions?

1618
01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:04.024
No. I got it.

1619
01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:05.442
Really glad you're here. TJ.

1620
01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:07.485
I don't wanna
fan boy too much.

1621
01:07:07.569 --> 01:07:09.195
but I think it's impressive
what you're doing as an artist.

1622
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:09.988
It's special.

1623
01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.157
Thanks.

1624
01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:15.243
Well. remember. the reason why
you are in this room right now

1625
01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:18.204
is because you've got
something special yourself.

1626
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:19.789
We're gonna have a great show.
Thanks.

1627
01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:20.582
You. too.

1628
01:07:24.919 --> 01:07:27.130
[sighs]

1629
01:07:29.674 --> 01:07:30.925
We're with him.

1630
01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:32.093
That was so easy.

1631
01:07:32.218 --> 01:07:32.844
I know. right?

1632
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:35.388
[laughs]

1633
01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:36.806
Are you nervous?

1634
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:37.640
Maybe a little .

1635
01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:38.350
I can tell.

1636
01:07:38.433 --> 01:07:40.268
How?

1637
01:07:40.393 --> 01:07:42.479
Because I wiggle my fingers.
too. when I'm nervous.

1638
01:07:42.645 --> 01:07:44.731
But you don't have to
be. because I think

1639
01:07:44.814 --> 01:07:46.066
you're a famous musician now.

1640
01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:47.692
Oh. well. not quite.

1641
01:07:47.859 --> 01:07:49.486
But I don't have to be
famous because you're

1642
01:07:49.569 --> 01:07:52.405
the only fan I need.

1643
01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:54.157
Who's ready for some
backstage passes?

1644
01:07:54.282 --> 01:07:54.949
Me!

1645
01:07:55.075 --> 01:07:55.992
Ta ta ta ta.

1646
01:07:56.117 --> 01:07:57.327
What?

1647
01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.245
This is for you.

1648
01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:02.374
During intermission. downstairs.
come meet me down there.

1649
01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:05.043
and I can introduce you to Trey.

1650
01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:06.002
Thank you.

1651
01:08:06.127 --> 01:08:08.338
[gasps] I see Mateo!

1652
01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:09.255
Oh. I got her.

1653
01:08:09.422 --> 01:08:10.173
Thank you.

1654
01:08:12.717 --> 01:08:14.094
You look beautiful.

1655
01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.846
Thank you.

1656
01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:19.516
Is there a special saying
you say to a guitarist.

1657
01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:20.642
like break a string?

1658
01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:21.518
No.

1659
01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:22.519
Don't say that?
No?

1660
01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:23.853
Not that one.

1661
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.896
- Don't ever do that again?
- No.

1662
01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:25.855
Great.
OK.

1663
01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.690
Yeah.

1664
01:08:26.856 --> 01:08:27.691
[guitar riff]

1665
01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:31.319
Oh. that's my cue.

1666
01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:32.195
Break a string.

1667
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.947
No!

1668
01:08:34.114 --> 01:08:35.532
[trey stasio. "better"]

1669
01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:38.034
[audience cheering]

1670
01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:43.123
All I got would wash away

1671
01:08:43.248 --> 01:08:46.376
Get pulled under the waves

1672
01:08:46.543 --> 01:08:52.007
Lose myself and never be found

1673
01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:55.385
A hundred breaks on my back

1674
01:08:55.552 --> 01:08:57.679
Waiting for the crash

1675
01:08:57.762 --> 01:08:59.806
What goes up

1676
01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:04.102
Always comes back down

1677
01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:07.772
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

1678
01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:10.066
Somehow you found me

1679
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:13.611
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

1680
01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:16.990
To walk around me

1681
01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:21.995
Thank God. I'm note alone

1682
01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:28.209
We can walk this world together

1683
01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:31.588
I'm ready for the
heartbreak you broke through

1684
01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:34.424
I'm ready because you did
when you didn't have to

1685
01:09:34.507 --> 01:09:40.805
I'm ready for loving you

1686
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:46.019
Thank God. I'm not alone

1687
01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:52.650
We can walk this road together

1688
01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:56.988
I could get by on my own

1689
01:09:57.072 --> 01:10:04.412
But with you. I'm better

1690
01:10:04.537 --> 01:10:08.625
I might survive on my own

1691
01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:14.839
But with you. I'm better

1692
01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:18.134
[audience cheering]

1693
01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:22.555
Thank you. thank
you. thank you.

1694
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.647
This is the best
day of my life!

1695
01:10:34.067 --> 01:10:35.527
That baseline slashed.

1696
01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:37.737
It was so cool.

1697
01:10:37.904 --> 01:10:39.280
Dude. great job yourself. man.

1698
01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.032
Oh. I'm just
following your lead.

1699
01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:42.659
Listen. man.

1700
01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:44.244
I didn't mention it
before. just in case.

1701
01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:48.665
but this gig is
actually an audition.

1702
01:10:48.748 --> 01:10:51.501
My usual lead guitarist just
went solo. so I'm looking

1703
01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:52.460
for someone for my tour.

1704
01:10:52.627 --> 01:10:54.462
What?

1705
01:10:54.546 --> 01:10:57.632
Four months in the
States and two in Europe.

1706
01:10:57.799 --> 01:10:58.550
Six months?

1707
01:10:58.675 --> 01:10:59.718
Yeah.

1708
01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:00.385
So. what do you think?

1709
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:01.386
You game?

1710
01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:02.178
I mean--

1711
01:11:02.303 --> 01:11:04.931
[sucks teeth] yeah.

1712
01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:06.057
You sure?
[chuckles]

1713
01:11:06.182 --> 01:11:07.183
Yeah.

1714
01:11:07.308 --> 01:11:09.477
Yeah. I wanted this forever.

1715
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:10.895
So. yes.

1716
01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:11.980
When-- when do we start?

1717
01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:14.024
Two weeks.

1718
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:16.026
I know it's a quick turnaround.
but can you make it work?

1719
01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:17.068
Yeah.
OK.

1720
01:11:17.235 --> 01:11:18.695
Yeah.
- Awesome. man.

1721
01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:19.946
- Thank you.
- Looking forward to it. man.

1722
01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.114
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1723
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:21.948
Thanks. man.
- Yeah

1724
01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:24.451
Is that the rock star?

1725
01:11:24.576 --> 01:11:25.869
Hey!

1726
01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:28.288
Hello.

1727
01:11:28.413 --> 01:11:29.998
You guys were almost
as good as Taylor.

1728
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.166
Ah!

1729
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.043
Thank you. Ruby. for that.

1730
01:11:33.168 --> 01:11:34.919
Means a lot coming from you.

1731
01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:36.421
Do you want some snacks?

1732
01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:38.298
There's a whole table
full of snacks over there.

1733
01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:39.591
I'll introduce you
to Trey afterwards.

1734
01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:42.093
Yeah?

1735
01:11:42.218 --> 01:11:43.345
It's so good.

1736
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.513
You are so good.

1737
01:11:45.638 --> 01:11:47.766
Thank you.

1738
01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:48.808
Uh. so I have some news.

1739
01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:49.601
Yeah?

1740
01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.478
Yeah.

1741
01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:53.813
Trey just offered me
lead guitar on the tour.

1742
01:11:53.897 --> 01:11:54.522
What?

1743
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:55.857
Yeah.

1744
01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:57.067
Oh. my-- that is so amazing!

1745
01:11:57.233 --> 01:11:57.901
I know.

1746
01:11:57.984 --> 01:11:58.610
Congratulations.

1747
01:11:58.735 --> 01:11:59.778
Thank you.

1748
01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:00.737
Thank you. thank you.

1749
01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.156
But. um. I. uh--

1750
01:12:03.323 --> 01:12:04.741
I'm leaving in two weeks.

1751
01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:08.119
And it's for six months.

1752
01:12:08.244 --> 01:12:12.415
Ah-- you're-- you're
leaving for half a year.

1753
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.542
Yeah. but I'll
FaceTime. and I'll text.

1754
01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:16.002
and I'll get some breaks.

1755
01:12:16.086 --> 01:12:17.087
Yeah.

1756
01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.922
Uh. TJ--

1757
01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:19.714
I know.

1758
01:12:19.881 --> 01:12:20.799
I know.

1759
01:12:20.882 --> 01:12:22.801
It's the worst time.

1760
01:12:22.884 --> 01:12:24.469
And I don't know what to do.

1761
01:12:24.594 --> 01:12:28.473
So maybe. I should just not go.

1762
01:12:28.598 --> 01:12:29.849
What?

1763
01:12:30.016 --> 01:12:30.975
No. you have to take the gig.

1764
01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:32.727
Are you kidding me?

1765
01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:34.312
This is everything you've
ever wanted. you know.

1766
01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.021
It's just-- it--

1767
01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:36.773
Yeah.

1768
01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:37.607
It is what it is.

1769
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.109
And I'll FaceTime.

1770
01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:41.820
And. um. I'll get some--
some-- some breaks.

1771
01:12:41.903 --> 01:12:43.780
Yeah. you said that.

1772
01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:45.782
Yeah. you know just. um-- you
just do what you need to do.

1773
01:12:45.949 --> 01:12:47.158
and-- and it'll be fine.

1774
01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:47.951
I'm fine.

1775
01:12:48.034 --> 01:12:49.452
She's fine.

1776
01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:50.745
You know. we're--
we've always been fine.

1777
01:12:50.829 --> 01:12:51.413
Hey. hey.

1778
01:12:51.579 --> 01:12:53.206
So--

1779
01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:54.124
I'm not fine about it.

1780
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:55.500
You know what?

1781
01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:58.128
I'm-- um. we
actually have to go.

1782
01:12:58.211 --> 01:13:00.505
Because it's late. and
it's a school night. and--

1783
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.256
Don't do this.

1784
01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:02.966
You know what?

1785
01:13:03.133 --> 01:13:04.175
It's just-- it's absolutely
no hard feelings.

1786
01:13:04.259 --> 01:13:05.343
- Amelia.
- Just--

1787
01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.178
This is not fair.

1788
01:13:07.303 --> 01:13:09.014
I'm actually
really happy for you.

1789
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:09.723
I mean it.

1790
01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:10.724
Hey. Ruby?

1791
01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:12.350
We got to go.

1792
01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:13.643
We can't stay
for the second set?

1793
01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:15.228
No. baby.
It's super late.

1794
01:13:15.353 --> 01:13:16.813
We got to go.
- But I haven't met Trey yet.

1795
01:13:16.896 --> 01:13:17.814
Yeah. maybe. another time.

1796
01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:19.441
Just say goodbye to TJ.

1797
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:20.650
Bye. Rubes.

1798
01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:23.403
Bye. Shredder.

1799
01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:24.154
OK.

1800
01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:25.572
Come on.

1801
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:27.574
Let's go.

1802
01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:28.366
Great job tonight.

1803
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:29.284
Come on.

1804
01:13:29.409 --> 01:13:32.454
Bye. baby.

1805
01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.205
Bye.

1806
01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:35.540
We're back on in five.

1807
01:13:35.665 --> 01:13:36.332
Yeah.

1808
01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.384
I still don't understand
why you made us leave.

1809
01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:48.136
We're missing all
the best songs.

1810
01:13:48.303 --> 01:13:51.890
And you made TJ really sad.

1811
01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:54.601
Yeah. well. we're not gonna
be seeing TJ for a while.

1812
01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:57.312
He got a job on tour.
and he's going away.

1813
01:13:57.437 --> 01:14:00.023
But we'll see when
he gets back. right?

1814
01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.733
I. um--

1815
01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:04.152
I don't know.

1816
01:14:04.277 --> 01:14:06.237
He doesn't wanna
see me anymore?

1817
01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:07.989
No. honey.

1818
01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:09.324
No.

1819
01:14:09.449 --> 01:14:10.325
You listen to me.

1820
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.243
That is not it.

1821
01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:15.455
So he's not coming to my
family tree presentation?

1822
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.917
I just-- I don't
think it's a good idea.

1823
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.045
I think it's gonna
make it more painful.

1824
01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:23.755
This is all my fault.

1825
01:14:23.838 --> 01:14:25.882
No.

1826
01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:28.259
Come here. baby. it is not
your fault. You listen to me.

1827
01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:31.846
It is not your fault. You
didn't do anything wrong.

1828
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:33.390
You hear me?

1829
01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:36.184
I thought things
were going really well.

1830
01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:37.977
I'm very disappointed. too.

1831
01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:50.532
[light music]

1832
01:14:56.121 --> 01:14:59.374
[alarm ringing]

1833
01:15:02.752 --> 01:15:06.464
Hey. how are you doing?

1834
01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:08.008
Terrible.

1835
01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:11.386
And I can't even
write a song about it.

1836
01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:14.014
And I'm not gonna
present my family tree.

1837
01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:15.974
Well. maybe. let's give
that a little more thought.

1838
01:15:20.478 --> 01:15:21.938
I'm so sorry.

1839
01:15:22.105 --> 01:15:24.065
I know this hurts.

1840
01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:26.776
But I also know that
it's gonna be OK.

1841
01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:28.987
How do you know?

1842
01:15:29.154 --> 01:15:33.908
Well. because I have felt
the same way that you feel.

1843
01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:35.035
and I was OK.

1844
01:15:39.831 --> 01:15:42.292
MAURA: How's it
going over there?

1845
01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:45.712
I'm just rethinking
this whole subdivision.

1846
01:15:45.795 --> 01:15:47.756
Oh. yeah?

1847
01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:50.717
Well. there's not much to
rethink because it's happening.

1848
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.303
And let's stop with the
waffling and self-doubt.

1849
01:15:53.428 --> 01:15:55.638
Honestly. it's getting boring.

1850
01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.599
And don't think that
I don't know that all

1851
01:15:57.766 --> 01:15:59.976
this moping is about TJ.

1852
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.645
Amelia. I love you.

1853
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:04.481
But you messed up. babe.

1854
01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.024
Badly.

1855
01:16:06.107 --> 01:16:08.276
Your knee-jerk
reaction shut down.

1856
01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.945
It's hurting Ruby.

1857
01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:12.489
TJ didn't break her heart.

1858
01:16:12.614 --> 01:16:14.866
Please. you would never
even let him get close

1859
01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:15.992
enough to have the chance.

1860
01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.911
I have to protect her!

1861
01:16:18.078 --> 01:16:20.372
Stop with the
protecting Ruby spiel.

1862
01:16:20.538 --> 01:16:23.249
I have heard that as an excuse
at every phase of your life.

1863
01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:24.542
and I have never bought it.

1864
01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:27.045
And I still don't.

1865
01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:30.799
If you wanna live a guarded
life. that's your choice.

1866
01:16:30.965 --> 01:16:32.509
But Ruby shouldn't have
to pay the price for that.

1867
01:16:32.634 --> 01:16:35.970
[somber music]

1868
01:16:45.563 --> 01:16:47.774
[phone ringing]

1869
01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:49.317
Trey.

1870
01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:50.735
Hey. man.

1871
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.737
Yeah. good. good.

1872
01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:55.990
I wanted to discuss
the tour schedule.

1873
01:16:56.157 --> 01:16:57.992
Yeah. of course.

1874
01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:01.204
I really wanna make it work.
but I have a few caveats.

1875
01:17:01.287 --> 01:17:05.166
AMELIA: Ruby. honey. dinner.

1876
01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.084
Ruby?

1877
01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.506
Hey. what are you doing?

1878
01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:14.718
[feigns coughing]
I think I'm sick.

1879
01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:17.012
I probably shouldn't
go to school tomorrow.

1880
01:17:22.225 --> 01:17:26.271
And does this have anything
to do with tomorrow being

1881
01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.981
the family tree presentation?

1882
01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:29.566
Oh. that's tomorrow?

1883
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:32.277
[laughs] I'm so glad
you're a terrible liar.

1884
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:36.906
It's gonna make your teenage
years a lot easier for me.

1885
01:17:37.073 --> 01:17:45.123
Honey. [sighs] you wanted to
meet TJ because you wanted

1886
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:49.627
to know who you are. right?

1887
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:55.717
Well. who you are isn't defined
by your genes. or your parents.

1888
01:17:55.842 --> 01:17:59.346
Only you get to
decide who you are.

1889
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:05.560
But are the Cruzes
our relatives?

1890
01:18:05.685 --> 01:18:07.729
Yes.

1891
01:18:07.854 --> 01:18:09.564
Yes.

1892
01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:12.901
And they're always
gonna be our relatives.

1893
01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:15.278
And I hope they'll always
be our family. too.

1894
01:18:15.445 --> 01:18:18.239
And maybe our family tree
doesn't look exactly the way

1895
01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:22.619
you hoped or wanted it to.
but honey. that doesn't

1896
01:18:22.744 --> 01:18:24.079
make us any less of a family.

1897
01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:30.085
Do we have any
more poster board?

1898
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:31.670
Ah. yeah. I think we do.

1899
01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:33.213
Why?

1900
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.631
Because I'm gonna
remake my family tree.

1901
01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:36.549
Yeah?

1902
01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:37.884
And you better make me
some coffee. because I might

1903
01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:38.760
have to pull an all-nighter.

1904
01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:39.844
OK.

1905
01:18:39.969 --> 01:18:40.887
That is a hard no.

1906
01:18:41.054 --> 01:18:43.431
Come on.

1907
01:18:43.556 --> 01:18:44.849
How are you feeling. honey?

1908
01:18:44.933 --> 01:18:47.268
A little bit scared.
but super-excited.

1909
01:18:47.352 --> 01:18:48.895
Oh you're gonna do great.

1910
01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:50.730
I can't wait to see what
all the other kids have.

1911
01:18:50.855 --> 01:18:52.857
I wonder what Oliver is doing.

1912
01:18:52.982 --> 01:18:55.610
I wonder if there's any
single daddies for Auntie Maura.

1913
01:18:58.279 --> 01:18:58.947
I'll be right in.

1914
01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.007
Because we're from
Iceland and Cuba.

1915
01:19:17.173 --> 01:19:18.466
my dad says we're ice cubes.

1916
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:19.759
[laughter]

1917
01:19:19.884 --> 01:19:21.177
My mom hates it
when he says that.

1918
01:19:21.261 --> 01:19:22.387
not because she's
offended or anything.

1919
01:19:22.512 --> 01:19:24.305
just because it's not funny.

1920
01:19:24.472 --> 01:19:26.975
She hates dad jokes.
and he's full of them.

1921
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.144
He brings an extra
pair of socks with him

1922
01:19:29.227 --> 01:19:31.604
when he goes golfing because he
says. I might get a hole-in-one.

1923
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:32.564
Not good.

1924
01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:33.982
OLIVER: It's bad. I know.

1925
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:36.026
Ah. well. that's my family tree.

1926
01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:38.319
A round of
applause for Oliver.

1927
01:19:38.403 --> 01:19:39.571
[applause]

1928
01:19:39.696 --> 01:19:43.825
That was. um. informative.

1929
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:46.911
You finally used the
family text thread.

1930
01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:48.329
I was waiting for
something important.

1931
01:19:48.496 --> 01:19:49.164
Oh. this counts.

1932
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.375
[chuckles]

1933
01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:56.379
MISS WEAVER: And up
next. we have Ruby Weber.

1934
01:19:56.546 --> 01:19:59.507
Before anything. I want
to say that this project

1935
01:19:59.632 --> 01:20:01.468
was really a doozy.

1936
01:20:01.634 --> 01:20:02.886
So I definitely deserve an A.

1937
01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:05.972
[laughter]

1938
01:20:06.097 --> 01:20:08.933
But also. I learned a lot.

1939
01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:12.354
I learned that like
every tree. every family

1940
01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:13.897
and heritage is different.

1941
01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.940
Amen.

1942
01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:19.027
When Miss Weaver taught us
about the panda tree in science.

1943
01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:23.365
I had no idea how much it would
help me with this assignment.

1944
01:20:23.448 --> 01:20:26.701
As I connected with those
who share my heritage.

1945
01:20:26.826 --> 01:20:29.996
I realized how much
our family roots

1946
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.041
were interconnected.
like that special miracle

1947
01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:34.834
of nature. the panda.

1948
01:20:34.959 --> 01:20:37.754
And that's my word
for my family tree--

1949
01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:40.048
interconnected.

1950
01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:44.052
It means separate. but also
joined. part of something

1951
01:20:44.219 --> 01:20:45.178
bigger together.

1952
01:20:53.645 --> 01:20:57.899
These are the people that
are a part of my family tree.

1953
01:20:58.066 --> 01:20:59.484
And here are the roots.

1954
01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:03.405
All tangled and beautiful.

1955
01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:07.075
And honestly. I didn't
wanna to do this project.

1956
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.996
But now. I am so. so
glad I did because I

1957
01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:18.378
went looking for my relatives.
but I found my family.

1958
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:21.381
[applause]

1959
01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:25.385
[cheering]

1960
01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:34.936
Hey. that was great.

1961
01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:38.023
Your presentation was riveting.

1962
01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:39.816
I thought you were
gonna say terrific.

1963
01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:41.401
Ooh. terrific.

1964
01:21:41.484 --> 01:21:42.861
[laughs]

1965
01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:44.279
I deserve a treat.

1966
01:21:44.362 --> 01:21:45.405
Sure. yeah.

1967
01:21:45.488 --> 01:21:46.239
Go ahead.

1968
01:21:50.326 --> 01:21:51.786
Thanks for coming.

1969
01:21:51.911 --> 01:21:54.330
And thanks for texting.

1970
01:21:54.497 --> 01:21:58.626
Uh. I also wanted to tell you
that I spoke to John and Trey.

1971
01:21:58.793 --> 01:22:00.003
and they said that
they're gonna fly

1972
01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:02.964
me back home every two weeks.

1973
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:06.509
So maybe. I can see Ruby
on a more regular schedule.

1974
01:22:06.593 --> 01:22:09.971
if that's OK with you.

1975
01:22:10.096 --> 01:22:14.934
Um. can we just go into
the hallway and talk?

1976
01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:16.436
Yeah.

1977
01:22:16.519 --> 01:22:19.272
Last time this happened.
I got an earful.

1978
01:22:19.356 --> 01:22:20.982
Well. this time. I'm
the one that's in trouble.

1979
01:22:24.486 --> 01:22:27.072
It wasn't fair of me to
shut down on you like that.

1980
01:22:27.155 --> 01:22:29.991
I got scared. and I went
into protection mode.

1981
01:22:30.116 --> 01:22:33.119
And I say that it's
for Ruby. but it's not.

1982
01:22:33.286 --> 01:22:34.496
It's for me.

1983
01:22:34.662 --> 01:22:38.166
But she doesn't
need my protection.

1984
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:41.169
She trusts you.

1985
01:22:41.252 --> 01:22:43.546
And that is enough for me.

1986
01:22:43.713 --> 01:22:46.841
And thank you so much
for making the effort

1987
01:22:46.966 --> 01:22:49.094
to come back and visit
Ruby during your tour.

1988
01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:50.762
It just-- it means--

1989
01:22:50.887 --> 01:22:52.263
it means a lot to
me. and I know it's

1990
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:53.765
going to mean the world to her.

1991
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:57.352
I cannot wait to tell her.

1992
01:22:57.519 --> 01:22:58.812
That's beyond wonderful.

1993
01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:01.898
Thank you.

1994
01:23:02.023 --> 01:23:04.609
OK. well now that we've
got Ruby all sorted.

1995
01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:06.695
I would like to say that. I--

1996
01:23:06.778 --> 01:23:11.825
I would also like to spend
some more time with you.

1997
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:13.159
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1998
01:23:13.326 --> 01:23:13.910
Really?

1999
01:23:14.035 --> 01:23:15.620
And if you're--

2000
01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:17.205
if you're interested. if--

2001
01:23:17.288 --> 01:23:18.373
if you wouldn't mind--

2002
01:23:18.456 --> 01:23:21.501

2003
01:23:30.927 --> 01:23:34.139
OMG. get a classroom. people!

2004
01:23:34.305 --> 01:23:36.808
[laughter]

2005
01:23:37.976 --> 01:23:38.852
I don't care.
