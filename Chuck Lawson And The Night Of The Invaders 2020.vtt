women to money. it's 2061.

138
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.294

thorough shower a little later.

you were out of prison.

145

This is embarrassing.

146
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.270
but may I get a picture with you please?

147
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.700
- Sure. but right after I take care.

148
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.683

Good bye.

230
00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:17.335
(phone beeping)

231
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.430
(people talking)

232
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.343
- Chuck Lawson.

233
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.979
welcome home.

234
00:15:26.979 --> 00:15:30.479
(uptempo patriotic music)

235
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.350
- Well. I must have forgotten

236
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.300
to take my blood pressure pills. died.

237
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.490
and went to hell. how ya been?

238
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.440
- Well. I'm still Chuck Lawson.
so better than most people.

239
00:16:00.364 --> 00:16:03.031
(both whirring)

240
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.290
- Chuck. meet Stokes and Forrest.

241
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.390
the two partners that just
tied your arrest record.

242
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.100
- And we're engaged.

243
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.811
- No case will ever tear us apart.

244
00:16:15.811 --> 00:16:20.811
(uptempo whimsical music)
(lips smacking)

245
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:25.210
- So if they have the arrest record.
then what's this sexy
beast still doing here?

246
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.203
- Me?
- Not you pal. the picture.

247
00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:33.180
- Okay.

248
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.760
- Oh yeah. we'll take care of that.

249
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.110
it just happened yesterday.

250
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.010
They caught two real-life magicians

251
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.693
using their full-blown
magic to rob a bank.

252
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.143
It was amazing. oh.

253
00:16:47.182 --> 00:16:50.383
(picture whooshing)
- Congratulations.

254
00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:58.268
(couple applauding)
(monkey dinging)

255
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.330
- Last but not least.

256
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.380
well. you two don't need an introduction.

257
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.070
- Well. Chug. it's nice to see you.

258
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.920
- I know.
- How you been?

259
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.600
- Kick ass. and you?

260
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.023
I see he treats you well.

261
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.833
- What?
- Your new boyfriend.

262
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.310
- Oh. I don't have a new--

263
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.993
- Got your tattoo removed.

264
00:17:29.353 --> 00:17:32.570
That could be from time or embarrassment.

265
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.093
but the pollen on your
right sleeve says otherwise.

266
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.160
It's from the Strelitzia plant.
or however you pronounce it.

267
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.360
I don't know. I'm not South African.

268
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.480
but the plant is. it doesn't
grow in this climate.

269
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.243
so it's pretty expensive to import.

270
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.213
- So maybe I--

271
00:17:52.213 --> 00:17:54.830
- Maybe you work for a
florist. yeah. maybe.

272
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.570
But you got to think. if
you were trimming the plant.

273
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.710
which you have to do constantly.
'cause you're right handed.

274
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.967
you would use your left
hand to hold the plant.

275
00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:01.540
and the right hand to hold the shears.

276
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.673
getting all the pollen on your left hand.

277
00:18:05.865 --> 00:18:08.413
Someone definitely handed you that flower.

278
00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:14.320
And plus. why would you work at a florist?

279
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.263
You hate flowers.

280
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:18.990
In conclusion (sighs).

281
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.070
you have a brand new boyfriend.

282
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.970
who obviously knows nothing about you.

283
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.073
- Well. you almost haven't changed at all.

284
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.638
- Thank you.

285
00:18:31.638 --> 00:18:33.638
- Parrot airport.
- What?

286
00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:36.370
- I just thought if I
said something random.

287
00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.050
you'd shut up.

288
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.600
- There's nothing open to shut.

289
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.923
Let's do it.

290
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.790
- Chuck. Serena. earlier today.

291
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.223
alien beings landed on Earth.

292
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.400
- Where?

293
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.050
- A little league field in Delco.

294
00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:01.120
(tense dramatic music)

295
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.060
- So what. we just mingle with some Ets.

296
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.030
and get our name on the front page?

297
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.000
Sounds easy enough.

298
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.990
- No. if you do your job right.

299
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.830
this story doesn't hit the news at all.

300
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.730
This kind of information

301
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.593
would send the public into a frenzy.

302
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.150
- Well. what are we doing here?

303
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.210
- We were just waiting for Chuck.

304
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.713
Meet at the baseball field in 0100 hours.

305
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.723
Chuck. stay. you need to
gear up with our tech expert.

306
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.970
- Director Daniels.
- How you doing?

307
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.870
- Chug. my name's Q-U-I-N-N.

308
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.500
Quinn. my name is Quinn.

309
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.500
Allow me to introduce you
to the new Agency Kit.

310
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.900
Just go ahead. and place
your hand on the crest.

311
00:19:41.503 --> 00:19:42.336
- I can't.

312
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.700
- Either hand will do.
- Oh okay.

313
00:19:47.942 --> 00:19:50.040
(case whooshing)

314
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.720
- So what does this do?

315
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.180
- I mean it tells time of.
unless you know how to use it!

316
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.391
(watch whooshing)
(man screaming)

317
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.463
- Not too bad.

318
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.360
- And these. these are your waterproof.

319
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.470
bulletproof shoes. they're
perfect for walking.

320
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.020
unless you know how to use 'em!

321
00:20:06.969 --> 00:20:08.470
(shoes whooshing)
(man screaming)

322
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.110
- Yeah. I think I got
that as a graduation gift.

323
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.690
a kindergarten graduation gift.

324
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.358
- Cute. now this--

325
00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:16.303
- Let me guess. let me guess.

326
00:20:16.303 --> 00:20:20.073
You write with it. of course.
unless you know how to use it!

327
00:20:20.937 --> 00:20:23.500
(pen clicking)

328
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.920
Then it's string?

329
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.832
- Unless you know how to use it!

330
00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:28.852
(string whooshing)

331
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.320
- [Woman] Can you shoot somewhere else?

332
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.300
- Anything useful in here?

333
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.350
- I mean everything else
you can find an app for

334
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.573
on The Agency phone.

335
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.283
Oh. and the most important thing.

336
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.493
the uniform.

337
00:20:45.094 --> 00:20:48.344
(slow patriotic music)

338
00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:56.186
- Well how do I look?
- Sexy.

339
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.823
- Yup. we'll be right
there. Madam President.

340
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.713
Enough dress up. boys. it's time.

- Ship is fully camouflaged.

354
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.900
- It popped up on our
radars at the Pentagon.

355
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.350
We knew there was no time
to get warrants or mandates.

356
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.390
not that I care. from
Congress to send the army in.

357
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.983
but that's when I knew
we needed The Agency.

358
00:23:02.152 --> 00:23:05.800
- But how do we even know
they wanna talk to us?

359
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.633
- We don't.

360
00:23:26.082 --> 00:23:29.665
(invisible steps whirring)

361
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.543
(uptempo jazz music)

362
00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:16.823
- Why is everything so old timey?

363
00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:20.760
- It looks like something from the 1900s.

364
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.720
- 1950s. kid.

365
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.900
The United States experienced
thousands of UFO sightings

366
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.830
in the early 1900s. the
strange thing is though.

367
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.190
they all stopped during the late 1950s.

368
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.670
My guess. they were observing us.

369
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.520
Trying to use the information
to create something familiar

370
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.220
for when they finally did make contact.

371
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.800
- So they want us to be comfortable?

372
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800
I'd say that's good.

373
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.023
- I recarpeted my guest bedroom.

374
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

375
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.033
I went with like a light gray.

376
00:24:54.968 --> 00:24:55.801
- Oh.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:58.620
it really opens up the space. it's nice.

378
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.570
- Guys. can you believe that
we're gonna be the first people

379
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.600
to make contact with alien life.

380
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.090
We got to show 'em something
that makes us human.

381
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.260
Like art. art is what makes us human.

382
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.120
- You're so right. babe. and math.

383
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.670
Any civilization who has
this type of technology

384
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.142
must know simple math.

385
00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:15.439
- Oh my god. you're so right.

386
00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:17.452
I just wanna propose to
you so badly right now.

387
00:25:17.452 --> 00:25:19.993
- (giggles) But you already did.

388
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.700
- Hey. I have a proposal for you.

389
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.609
why don't you both shut the hell up?

390
00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:26.920
(both laughing)

391
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.900
- Dude. honestly. sick joke.

392
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.620
I mean usually I'm the
funny one around here.

393
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.357
but like it's great to have someone else.

394
00:25:32.357 --> 00:25:34.875
- You guys are missing the target.

395
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.890
We're not here tom show
them our report cards.

396
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.163
we're here to find out
what the aliens want.

397
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.390
- Well. I mean some
people think they're here

398
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.780
to take our jobs. but I
just don't agree with--

399
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.750
- Serena!
- What?

400
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.825
I didn't think it was that bad of a--

401
00:25:45.825 --> 00:25:47.937
- Everybody down!

402
00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:50.539
(tense dramatic music)

403
00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:52.539
Daddy's Little Princess.

404
00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:57.698
(object thudding)

405
00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:12.034
- Chongos.

406
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.060
- Peanut butter chongos.

407
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.120
- It's a peace offering.

408
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.980
They want to give us something earthly.

409
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.440
- Great idea. eat the poison treats.

410
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.560
Is this the kind of quick thinking

411
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.320
that broke the arrest record?

412
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.593
- We did that with love.

413
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.100
- I mean if the aliens wanted to kill us.

414
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.150
they probably would have done it already.

415
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.463
- I'm still shacked up at my mom's.

416
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

417
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.233
- How's Darlene?

418
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.530
- She's gotten better.
- How's the hip?

419
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:51.773
I heard her hip was--
- She just. she loves sports.

420
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.460
- You got to tell Darlene
to lay off that hip. man.

421
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.293
- You try telling her.
- She cannot--

422
00:26:55.293 --> 00:26:56.737
- You try telling her.

423
00:26:56.737 --> 00:26:58.117
- I'll give her call. say.

424
00:26:58.117 --> 00:27:00.720
"Darlene. you cannot play tackle football.

425
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.463
Tag at most. tag at most. you know.

426
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.933
- She is a beast out there.

427
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.770
- What does your gun say?
- Daddy's Little Princess.

428
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.380
- I don't get it. is your
gun the little princess.

429
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.640
and you're it's daddy?

430
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.110
- Or are you daddy's little princess.

431
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.910
and that's just your name on it.

432
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.033
- No. I just thought it was funny.

433
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.303
(television buzzing)

434
00:27:39.572 --> 00:27:42.661
(creature growling)

435
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:43.494
- Hello?

436
00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:49.486
(creature burping)

437
00:27:49.486 --> 00:27:51.790
- It sounds like a rhythm.

438
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.554
- They must communicate through music.

439
00:27:54.554 --> 00:27:57.413
♪ I was working in the
lab late one night ♪

440
00:27:57.413 --> 00:27:59.750
- What is your purpose here?

441
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.750
(creature growling)

442
00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.330
- What are they saying?

443
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.710
- They're saying.

444
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.944
We're here to kill Stokes and Forrest?

445
00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:17.200
(both gasping)

446
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.163
- What is your purpose here?

447
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.190
(creature growling)

448
00:28:24.843 --> 00:28:27.676
- Maybe we should get out of here.

449
00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:33.211
(logo whooshing)

450
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.793
- Looks like lobsters?

451
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.800
- Sideways lobster. upside-down lobster.

452
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.080
two lobsters holding hands.

453
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.873
one on the outside that's
jealous of it. and Tyrimpson?

454
00:28:50.188 --> 00:28:53.050
- But why isn't that in alien?

455
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.893
- Because it's a proper noun.
Agent. it doesn't translate.

456
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.950
It looks like I just booked
an all-expense-paid vacation

457
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.060
to the Tyrimpson Corporation.

458
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.350
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

459
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.417
You see Tyrimpson's name in one message.

460
00:29:06.417 --> 00:29:09.880
and all of a sudden you have
a whole plan. what's going on?

461
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.068
- There's no time to explain.

462
00:29:12.068 --> 00:29:14.660
- But there kind of is time to explain.

463
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.580
'cause we still have to walk
through like the whole ship.

464
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.453
and back to the field and everything.

465
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:20.203
- Fine.

466
00:29:21.524 --> 00:29:23.830
(tense dramatic music)

467
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.900
Serena is right. we can assume
the aliens are friendly.

468
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.930
because they didn't try to kill us.

469
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.364
and because they gave us the chocolate--

470
00:29:29.364 --> 00:29:30.197
- [Forrest] Peanut butter.

471
00:29:30.197 --> 00:29:32.340
- Peanut butter chongos
as a peaceful gesture.

472
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.217
Now. we know that the
reason why they're here

473
00:29:33.217 --> 00:29:35.240
has something to do with Tyrimpson.

474
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.560
You'd assume they didn't fly all this way

475
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.030
just to let us know that
Tyrimpson is a pretty cool dude.

476
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.250
My guess. it's a warning.

477
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.170
They're probably trying
to warn us about some plan

478
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.590
of Tyrimpson. and if we
don't act now. we're gonna.

479
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.540
Does anyone know how to open this door?

480
00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:54.760
(door squaking)
Thank you.

481
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.360
- Well. I got a guest bedroom

482
00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.130
that quite frankly I don't know why.

483
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.170
'cause I don't have that many guests.

484
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.370
but you're more than welcome to stop by.

485
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.590
stay a couple of nights.
- God. she'd kill me.

486
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.107
she really would.
- Oh.

487
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.200
- I'm going to go to Tyrimpson's lab

488
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.910
to figure out what's going on.
- Alone?

489
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.410
- [Chuck] Fine. Serena.
you can come with me.

490
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.880
Shrek and Fiona. you stay behind

491
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.720
and decode the alien's message.

492
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.833
- What's a Shrek?

493
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.400
- So what's the story?

494
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.660
- Better send some adult
diapers to heaven. Marge.

495
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.252
Sherlock Holmes is about to shit himself.

496
00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:26.610
(upbeat music)

497
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.630
(tense dramatic music)

498
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.883
Henchmen. searchlights.
case closed. bad guy.

499
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.740
- What's the plan?

500
00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:47.500
(buttons dinging)

501
00:30:50.153 --> 00:30:51.105
Got it.

502
00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:54.438
(tense whimsical music)

503
00:31:17.372 --> 00:31:19.123
(keypad whooshing)

504
00:31:19.123 --> 00:31:20.853
- What is taking so long?

505
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:26.796
(henchman grunting)
(keypad buzzing)

506
00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:28.726
- There's a two in there somewhere.

507
00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:34.978
That's not my birthday.

508
00:31:39.486 --> 00:31:41.743
(keypad buzzing)
It's someone's birthday.

509
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.930
(gate whooshing)

510
00:31:54.687 --> 00:31:57.770
(uptempo rock music)

511
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:01.958
(hoverboard whooshing)

512
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.757
(punch thudding)

513
00:32:09.642 --> 00:32:11.809
- Got a cheese pizza here.

514
00:32:15.535 --> 00:32:20.535
- I can sign for that.
(punches thudding)

515
00:32:27.683 --> 00:32:30.600
(punches thudding)

516
00:32:32.797 --> 00:32:37.631
(clothes whooshing)
(zipper zipping)

517
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:40.881
(tense dramatic music)

518
00:32:50.913 --> 00:32:51.746
- Ow. ow.

519
00:32:53.253 --> 00:32:54.957
Chuck (grunts).

520
00:32:54.957 --> 00:32:55.790
Go!

521
00:33:00.928 --> 00:33:03.595
(Chuck sighing)

522
00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:14.440
- Can you please tell me
what we're looking for?

523
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.690
- Sorry. I thought it was so obvious.

524
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.340
I didn't need to explain.

525
00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.623
(camera whooshing)

526
00:33:24.418 --> 00:33:27.416
I probably have something
on here to deal with it.

527
00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:30.249
(phone whooshing)

528
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.140
what about this guy?

529
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.370
- [Phone] The eaves dropper.

530
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.320
- How does it work?

531
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.670
- I don't know I guess we just talk.

532
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.853
and it does something with our voice.

533
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.360
Okay. well I figure
whatever the aliens are here

534
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.310
to warn us about.

535
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.570
- [Woman] I don't wanna get married.

536
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.490
- [Man] Finally. you admit it.

537
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.820
- It has to be in one of these rooms.

538
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.755
so we're gonna search them.

539
00:33:55.755 --> 00:33:57.431
- [Man] I wish you the best of luck in LA.

540
00:33:57.431 --> 00:33:59.360
- [Woman] I don't wanna
rush in some wedding. just--

541
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.320
- So glad you're here. Chuck.

542
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.850
and I would've never come
up with that brilliant plan

543
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.180
on my own.

544
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.623
- [Woman] Please don't
walk out on me. Chuck.

545
00:34:06.623 --> 00:34:08.410
- But we're not just looking
around for random stuff.

546
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:11.190
we're looking for evidence. Serena.

547
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.100
- [Man] Frankly. Erica. I don't
give a damn what you need.

548
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.850
- All right. well I
think this room is clear.

549
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.150
let's move on.
- Oh no. no. no. Chuck.

550
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.550
we should search everything.

551
00:34:21.044 --> 00:34:23.450
- It's just a break room.
we already checked it.

552
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.139
- Yeah. well if I were Tyrimpson.

553
00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.860
I certainly wouldn't hide it in a room

554
00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.240
labeled evil invention.

555
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.690
- But it is an evil invention.

556
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.220
it's not just random thing like pizza.

557
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.603
Oh sick. pizza.

558
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.233
Pizza?

559
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.713
- Oh. no thanks. I'm not hungry.

560
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.870
- Wait. didn't you like eat six hours ago?

561
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.480
- Well. I ate a very big dinner.

562
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.933
and lunch. and breakfast.

563
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.850
I'm not hungry!

564
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.320
- You don't eat pizza when you're hungry.

565
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.290
you eat it when it's around.

566
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.020
that's the whole point of pizza.

567
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.890
- Okay. well. we shouldn't
even be eating the pizza.

568
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.330
because what if somebody comes in here.

569
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.570
and they realize that
there are missing slices?

570
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.930
- They'll just think a coworker took it.

571
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.250
and they'll leave a
passive aggressive note.

572
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.163
come on. eat up.

573
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.040
- I don't like pizza. okay?

574
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.410
I don't like pizza.

575
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.038
What's wrong with that?

576
00:35:19.038 --> 00:35:20.630
Does it make me a freak?

577
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.690
- Yes. you are a freak.
every human ever love pizza.

578
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.186
ever since the beginning of pizza

579
00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:29.443
when Ben Franklin declared it
the national food of America.

580
00:35:29.443 --> 00:35:32.578
(angelic choral music)

581
00:35:32.578 --> 00:35:35.328
(Chuck munching)

582
00:35:38.017 --> 00:35:41.100
(footsteps thudding)

583
00:35:43.495 --> 00:35:48.495
(tense ominous music)
(guard humming)

584
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.687
(laser buzzing)

585
00:36:13.482 --> 00:36:16.750
What the hell. Serena?

586
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.353
Why did you shoot her?

587
00:36:18.353 --> 00:36:20.493
- I don't know. I just panicked!

588
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.380
- You just hand her a can.

589
00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.403
it's the classic hand 'em a can routine.

590
00:36:26.403 --> 00:36:29.110
(both sighing)

591
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.693
We were wearing the
uniforms. you didn't need to.

592
00:36:31.693 --> 00:36:34.193
I guess we didn't need to
hide in the first place.

593
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.740
- What are we gonna do with 'em?

594
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.520
Like what if somebody comes in here.

595
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.420
and like finds it?

596
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.183
(uptempo funk music)

597
00:36:56.378 --> 00:36:57.211
- Howdy!

598
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.418
- (sighs) Yeah. that's not gonna work.

599
00:37:02.418 --> 00:37:04.918
- [Director] So let's lean in.

600
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.437
- But wait.
- Look at each other.

601
00:37:10.437 --> 00:37:13.520
(uptempo funk music)

602
00:37:16.336 --> 00:37:17.169
- Howdy!

603
00:37:20.496 --> 00:37:23.746
(tense dramatic music)

604
00:37:27.924 --> 00:37:32.924
(door unlatching)
(room whirring)

605
00:37:35.384 --> 00:37:37.528
Mnemosyne Depositum.

606
00:37:37.528 --> 00:37:39.750
Mnemosyne is the Greek goddess. Memory.

607
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.950
I'm willing to bet the depositum
probably means deposit.

608
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.750
- So this could be where
Tyrimpson stores his memories.

609
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:46.930
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

610
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.447
just like Dumbledore from.
you know. from "Harry Potter."

611
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.270
- I wouldn't know. I've never seen it.

612
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.470
What?

613
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.630
- Yeah. I've never seen "Harry Potter"!

614
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.143
I just don't like old movies.

615
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.740
- No. no. no. no. we saw it together.

616
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.854
you know when we first starting dating?

617
00:38:04.854 --> 00:38:09.063
- Oh right. yeah. yeah.
I forgot. I'm sorry.

618
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.693
- It's fine. all right.

619
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.753
Let's do this.

620
00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:26.564
(helmet whirring)

621
00:38:26.564 --> 00:38:30.252
(upbeat music)
(logos whirring)

622
00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:32.919
(clock ticking)

623
00:38:39.702 --> 00:38:41.520
(image whooshing)

624
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.996
- [Perez] Gerbil barbershop quartet.

625
00:38:43.996 --> 00:38:48.030
Now the call just came in.
Mayor Sandoval is missing.

626
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.720
- Serena. go to City Hall.

627
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.420
see if there's anything in his office.

628
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.560
Chuck. you head over to the art museum.

629
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.270
This is a direct connection
to the missing paintings

630
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.821
stolen by Libyan art smugglers.

631
00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:02.071
(tense dramatic music)

632
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.767
- Serena!
- The office is a dead end.

633
00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.190
They have the mayor at
the Technology Center.

634
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.914
it's gonna blow up.
- How do you know?

635
00:39:16.914 --> 00:39:17.757
- There's a riddle here. it says.

636
00:39:17.757 --> 00:39:20.170
"Find me at the place
with hundreds of stories."

637
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.560
it has to be the Technology Center.

638
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.922
it's the tallest building in Philly.

639
00:39:23.922 --> 00:39:27.620
- [Serena] Or it could mean
stories like books. the library?

640
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.910
- Yeah. that's more complex.

641
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.750
it makes sense. it's probably there.

642
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.810
- [Serena] It could be either though.

643
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.310
You're closer to the Technology Center.

644
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.030
so you check there.
I'll check the library.

645
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.530
- No. no. it's definitely the library.

646
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.609
I'll meet you there.

647
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:41.791
- [Serena] What's the harm
in checking just to be sure?

648
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:45.041
(tense dramatic music)

649
00:39:50.308 --> 00:39:53.543
(monkey buzzing)

650
00:39:53.543 --> 00:39:56.170
(explosion booming)
(glass shattering)

651
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.003
(logos whooshing)

652
00:40:01.528 --> 00:40:05.101
(Chuck grunting)

653
00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:06.333
- [Serena] What'd you see?

654
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.043
- Not much. just some of
Tyrimpson spreadsheets.

655
00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:16.917
and dirty movies. pornos (pants).

656
00:40:18.931 --> 00:40:22.181
(tense dramatic music)

657
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.460
Let's keep looking.

658
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.557
(door latching)

659
00:40:34.838 --> 00:40:36.505
- [Robot] Insert $1.

660
00:40:37.595 --> 00:40:39.787
- All right. I got a dollar
in here somewhere. sorry.

661
00:40:39.787 --> 00:40:40.620
- Okay.

662
00:40:44.576 --> 00:40:45.659
- One second.

663
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.870
- You know. I don't care what anyone says.

664
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.510
you still got it.

665
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:01.456
(coin clanking)
(robot dinging)

666
00:41:01.456 --> 00:41:04.289
(robot whooshing)

667
00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:11.485
(tense dramatic music)

668
00:41:14.032 --> 00:41:17.115
- [Robot] Armor suit test initiating.

669
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.507
This is not a simulation.
(simulation whooshing)

670
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.753
Fingerprint invalid.
(gunshots booming)

671
00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:36.476
- They're tracking our motion.

672
00:41:41.424 --> 00:41:44.341
(gunshots booming)

673
00:41:56.053 --> 00:41:59.053
(explosion booming)

674
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.890
We have to jump out at the same time!

675
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.675
- Right to trip the sensor.

676
00:42:17.675 --> 00:42:19.435
- On the count of three.

677
00:42:19.435 --> 00:42:20.866
One.
- Two.

678
00:42:20.866 --> 00:42:24.906
- Three.
(tense dramatic music)

679
00:42:24.906 --> 00:42:29.906
(sensor beeping)
(gunshots booming)

680
00:42:31.266 --> 00:42:34.516
(simulation whooshing)

681
00:42:40.815 --> 00:42:44.232
- (pants) You all right?

682
00:42:47.557 --> 00:42:51.557
"Oh. I think I have a
dollar in here somewhere."

683
00:42:56.818 --> 00:42:59.951
- Okay.
(boots marching)

684
00:42:59.951 --> 00:43:01.118
- What's that?

685
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:03.813
- More like where are they going.

686
00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:08.679
(tense dramatic music)

687
00:43:26.034 --> 00:43:29.284
You need to be dead to have a memorial.

688
00:43:31.037 --> 00:43:34.204
(tense ominous music)

689
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.173
- Mark?

690
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.183
Kathleen?

691
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.163
I didn't know you guys were
working outside today (laughs)!

692
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.580
We are. Algernon.

693
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.053
- We haven't worked outside
together in forever!

694
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.095
- Yeah. weird.

695
00:43:56.095 --> 00:44:00.210
I guess we've just been
scheduled differently.

696
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.870
- Oh. I did get fired.

697
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.100
Yeah. I mean they took me
right back when I got better.

698
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.113
- Oh cool.

699
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.120
- Better at what?

700
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.120
- Oh no. I got very. very sick.

701
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.970
and they replaced me like right away.

702
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.700
- Well.
- Oh my gosh.

703
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.153
That just reminded me.

704
00:44:19.153 --> 00:44:21.310
I have to transfer Shamus that money.

705
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.260
It's from that one day

706
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.850
when we all went to dinner after work.

707
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.830
and I ate some of Shamus's chips.

708
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.780
and he said "Hey you better
transfer me some cash for those"

709
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.370
and I said "Ha. ha Shamus.
you're a funny dude".

710
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.517
and he said. "No seriously Algernon.

711
00:44:33.517 --> 00:44:35.517
"those are my chips. and I'm hungry.

712
00:44:35.517 --> 00:44:38.117
"I ordered the appetizer
size. not the entree.

713
00:44:38.117 --> 00:44:39.617
"and there's not enough for you.

714
00:44:39.617 --> 00:44:41.217
"besides you keep chewing them up.

715
00:44:41.217 --> 00:44:44.520
"and spitting them into your
napkin. it's disgusting."

716
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.210
- Okay. it's been super
great getting to catch up.

717
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.397
and everything. but we really got to go.

718
00:44:48.397 --> 00:44:52.720
- You're right. don't
wanna get fired again.

719
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.640
But I will see you guys around.

720
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.310
hopefully in the next couple of minutes.

721
00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:57.867
- Yeah. or not. bye-bye.

722
00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.493
Jesus.

723
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.130
Back on planet Earth.

724
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.567
the world's greatest detective

725
00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:07.751
is about to break his arrest record.

726
00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:12.060
- [Robot] Access denied.
outside badges not permitted.

727
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.833
- Hey world's greatest detective.

728
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.513
- [Both] Algernon.
- What's up. Kathlark?

729
00:45:19.513 --> 00:45:21.703
(both screaming)
- [Both] Jesus!

730
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.007
- We were just talking about how

731
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.380
I didn't get one of
your world famous hugs.

732
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.100
I forgot to hug you. yeah.

733
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.503
- I noticed that too. but I
didn't wanna say anything.

734
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.687
(Chuck whimpering)

735
00:45:41.921 --> 00:45:43.470
(Algernon giggling)
(Chuck grunting)

736
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:48.470
- Oh wow. Mark. I'm super
jealous of that hug.

737
00:45:48.803 --> 00:45:52.340
- That is such a good hug. Kathleen.

738
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.160
We should get a picture to
commemorate this moment.

739
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.050
- I was thinking the same thing.

740
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:00.040
but I didn't wanna say anything.

741
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.440
- Okay.

742
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.273
Ready?

743
00:46:05.152 --> 00:46:07.985
(camera snapping)

744
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.040
- Why'd you flash her?

745
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.872
- [Chuck] I don't do hugs.

746
00:46:21.872 --> 00:46:23.710
- [Robot] Access granted.

747
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.960
(tense dramatic music)

748
00:46:30.453 --> 00:46:31.286
- Ow.

749
00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:34.809
(pipe dripping)

750
00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:36.400
- Oh my god. Serena.

751
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.750
it's been infected by
the deadly chemical. H20.

752
00:46:51.654 --> 00:46:52.737
- Whoa. whoa.

753
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.683
- What are those?

754
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.325
- See-through-clothes glasses.

755
00:46:57.325 --> 00:46:58.985
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

756
00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:00.795
But seriously where did
you get that piercing?

757
00:47:00.795 --> 00:47:03.014
- Shut up.
(both chuckling)

758
00:47:03.014 --> 00:47:04.931
- They don't even work.

759
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.203
- Chuck.

760
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.923
Why do you think we broke up?

761
00:47:31.923 --> 00:47:34.679
(slow somber music)

762
00:47:34.679 --> 00:47:38.413
well. it's after the library incident.

763
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.080
you just started looking
at me differently.

764
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.247
You fell in love with Agent Chuck Lawson.

765
00:47:45.247 --> 00:47:47.283
the hero who always save the day.

766
00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:49.886
not the idiot who killed the mayor.

767
00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:52.655
- I didn't break up with you.

768
00:47:52.655 --> 00:47:55.870
because I saw you differently. Chuck.

769
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.963
I broke up with you because
you started acting differently.

770
00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:03.220
I don't care if you're a hero or not.

771
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.290
I loved you back at the academy.

772
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.090
before you were Agent Chuck Lawson.

773
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:12.110
After the library thing.
you just got so distant.

774
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:13.820
- I was too ashamed to say how I felt.

775
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.770
- Well. that's the problem with people.

776
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.070
they never say what they really mean.

777
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.177
- Sometimes the thing you're looking for

778
00:48:21.177 --> 00:48:23.577
was right in front of
your face the entire time.

779
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.183
There it is.

780
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.590
This must be the invention.

781
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.210
- [Serena] What does it do?

782
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.380
I think it's mind control.

783
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.830
It's probably connected
to everyone's brains.

784
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.920
and Tyrimpson speaks his commands into it.

785
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.780
- Do you really think
Tyrimpson could be capable

786
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.700
of something that sophisticated?

787
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.800
- He's invented things that control

788
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.070
people's behavior before.

789
00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.083
He's probably building up to this.

790
00:48:48.083 --> 00:48:50.760
I mean he's probably been
working on controlling people's--

791
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.013
- Hello agents.

792
00:48:56.398 --> 00:48:58.270
A strange time of night for a tour.

793
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:01.140
but I suppose I don't
have anything better to do

794
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.245
at 03:00 a.m.

795
00:49:02.245 --> 00:49:04.418
(tense dramatic music)

796
00:49:04.418 --> 00:49:05.251
Step this way.

797
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.673
Yes. come on.

798
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.643
Keep coming.

799
00:49:12.513 --> 00:49:13.346
Closer.

800
00:49:14.437 --> 00:49:16.293
The tour begins here.

801
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.360
At the same. you could go a
little faster if you wanted.

802
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.003
Just a smidge more.

803
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.453
You have to step on the thing.

804
00:49:30.993 --> 00:49:32.980
(upbeat music)
Perfect.

805
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.500
Shall we?

806
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.700
Although we are a
technologically-based company.

807
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.650
we like to remain entrenched in nature.

808
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.800
hence the horticulture.

809
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:47.660
This room alone contains over
63 different specie of plant.

810
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.960
And all those plants. require a lot of?

811
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.653
Water. yes. so I designed
the irrigation system.

812
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.970
The pipes drop water on
the plants at ideal times

813
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.430
during the day. or by command.

814
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.890
using one of the buttons
you see around the room.

815
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.650
As you can probably guess
by the exquisite nature

816
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.170
of the architecture of my manor.

817
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:14.496
I'm an assiduous patron of the arts.

818
00:50:14.496 --> 00:50:16.346
- Yeah. I was thinking assiduous too.

819
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.353
- This is a sculpture of me
I hired an artist to make.

820
00:50:24.894 --> 00:50:26.153
- It's very abstract.

821
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:29.293
- No. it's not done yet.

822
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.180
Would you humor me. and
allow me to show you

823
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.083
some of my latest inventions?

824
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.703
- Why not?

825
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.850
- Wonderful.

826
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:43.683
Right this way.

827
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:50.180
This is one of my most proudest designs.

828
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.433
A short-distance teleportation device.

829
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:59.030
Now. of course. living
tissue would be torn apart

830
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.640
if subjected to teleportation.

831
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.053
but this works on firmer objects.

832
00:51:06.151 --> 00:51:09.830
(teleporter whooshing)

833
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.937
there goes Mr. Sunglasses (laughs).

834
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.463
Let's move on. shall we.

835
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.713
Now. this is the Hypermagnet.

836
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.913
You turn it on. and it
attracts metal to it.

837
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.763
It's a magnet.

838
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:34.160
Now. this is the Hyperbounce.
it's a child's toy really.

839
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:37.310
You switch it on. and
it creates five times

840
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.423
the elastic response.

841
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.520
Mr. Sunglasses will demonstrate.

842
00:51:43.045 --> 00:51:47.376
(sunglasses thudding)
(glass shattering)

843
00:51:47.376 --> 00:51:50.209
(object whirring)

844
00:51:52.165 --> 00:51:54.415
let's move along. shall we?

845
00:51:55.536 --> 00:51:59.490
Now. I call this the
precipitation machine.

846
00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:03.010
You just shake it up.
and frozen precipitation

847
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.280
forms and falls within the dome.

848
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.883
- So it's like a snow globe?

849
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.150
- No. a snow globe has snow.

850
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.593
this has glitter. it's
very different and cool.

851
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:17.261
'cause it has my picture in it.

852
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:25.733
Now. this next one is.

853
00:52:30.121 --> 00:52:31.878
- Dr. Tyrimpson. Freeze!

854
00:52:31.878 --> 00:52:34.300
(orb dailing)

855
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.060
- What now. Chuck?

856
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.810
Are you going to call me to death?

857
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.610
- [Voicemail] The caller
you are trying to reach.

858
00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.463
- Dr. Tyrimpson freeze.
- Is not available.

859
00:52:45.141 --> 00:52:45.974
- But I

860
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.403
thought it was--
- a cellular phone. Chuck.

861
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.030
It allows you to call anyone. anywhere.

862
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.850
without the need for cell service or wifi.

863
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:01.980
A most helpful thing. you
see no cell phone company

864
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.310
has coverage at Tyrimpson Manor.

865
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:09.010
It uses naturally occurring
electromagnetic waves

866
00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:11.910
that can travel through
anything even a vacuum.

867
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:14.113
Go ahead. call Director Daniels.

868
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:23.700
- Call Marge Daniels.
- Calling Marge Daniels.

869
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.670
- [Marge] Chuck. I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

870
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.060
Where's Serena?

871
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.980
Listen. Stokes and Forrest
decoded the aliens' message!

872
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.270
The aliens are inviting us
to join a galactic alliance!

873
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.260
They want to take us and President Sachs

874
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.450
to sign treaties and celebrate.

875
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.910
Thank you both for your
help. I'll see you soon!

876
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.453
So I was--
- Wrong?

877
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.390
Don't look so surprised. Chuck.

878
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.740
it's hardly the first time.

879
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.093
Your infamous mix-up at the library?

880
00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:03.260
Did you blow up the mayor or something?

881
00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.440
Actually. Chuck. the death
toll was two that night.

882
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.800
The mayor. yes. but my husband. Frank.

883
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.510
He worked there. and that night.

884
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:13.573
he didn't come home.

885
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.930
I think you two should leave now.

886
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:21.161
Don't forget your souvenirs.

887
00:54:21.161 --> 00:54:24.411
(tense dramatic music)

888
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.270
- How could I've been so wrong?

889
00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:31.098
Look. I'm something.

890
00:54:31.098 --> 00:54:33.696
there's got to be something else.
there's got to be something more.

891
00:54:33.696 --> 00:54:34.529
Why was he so calm?

892
00:54:34.529 --> 00:54:37.830
Why was Tyrimpson so calm when
there's two agency detectives

893
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:40.380
just wandering through his lab
in the middle of the night?

894
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.210
That's suspicious. right.
there's got to be more.

895
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.560
No Chuck. there's nothing more.

896
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.610
You heard what Marge said.

897
00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:49.110
they've figured out their
purpose. case closed.

898
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.640
- Case not closed. case
open. case very. very open!

899
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.180
Why was his name in the message.

900
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.850
and everything else
was written in lobster.

901
00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.289
- Hey. take a breath. okay?

902
00:54:58.289 --> 00:55:00.039
You don't always have to be a hero.

903
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.003
They solved the case. everything's fine.

904
00:55:05.286 --> 00:55:07.340
- But the message and The Connection.

905
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.216
- Hey. I have something for you.

906
00:55:10.216 --> 00:55:13.216
(slow somber music)

907
00:55:17.278 --> 00:55:18.111
- Whoa.

908
00:55:20.677 --> 00:55:22.630
Where did you find a record player?

909
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:23.463
- Flea market.

910
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.903
Actually I got it for
you when we were dating.

911
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:32.643
but then. you know. the
library happened and all that.

912
00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:34.150
I never gave it to you. but.

913
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.573
- Thank you.

914
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.443
Don't suppose you picked
up any records. did you?

915
00:55:50.217 --> 00:55:51.567
It's the only one they had.

916
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.673
- Of course.

Wait. this is so much
bigger than we thought!

947
00:57:07.707 --> 00:57:10.830
Serena. The aliens aren't
warning us about Tyrimpson.

948
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.140
they're working with Tyrimpson.

949
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.857
He's must've been communicating
with them through that orb.

950
00:57:16.945 --> 00:57:21.530
The Connection between him and the aliens.

951
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:25.150
can speak to people through
vacuums. like space.

952
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.510
Tyrimpson probably hid that
message in "Monster Mash"

953
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.320
to brainwash people into
trusting the aliens.

954
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.277
That's why that godforsaken song

955
00:57:31.277 --> 00:57:33.428
was on the radio all the time.

956
00:57:33.428 --> 00:57:35.930
- But what about the message they sent?

957
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.060
We decoded it. we know that
they just want the world leaders

958
00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:42.347
to sign a treaty.
- They probably decoded it wrong.

959
00:57:42.347 --> 00:57:44.687
The world leaders. why
would Tyrimpson want

960
00:57:44.687 --> 00:57:47.705
all the world leaders
to go with the aliens?

961
00:57:47.705 --> 00:57:49.122
- Mark. Kathleen?

962
00:57:51.203 --> 00:57:54.210
What are you guys still doing outside?

963
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.313
Whoa. is that a record player?

964
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.780
I've never seen one before.
but I know what it does.

965
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.833
it plays old music. like dubstep.

966
00:58:03.723 --> 00:58:05.430
I did have a day dream one time

967
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:07.771
where I was riding the
grooves like a boat.

968
00:58:07.771 --> 00:58:09.773
(gunshot booming)

969
00:58:09.773 --> 00:58:11.106
- What was that?

970
00:58:12.184 --> 00:58:17.184
- Look.
(head sizzling)

971
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:21.360
- So anyway. I was wondering if you guys

972
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.613
came up with any cool
nicknames for me yet.

973
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:26.620
- Here. check this out.

974
00:58:28.036 --> 00:58:31.036
(camera shuttering)

975
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.240
- I was thinking maybe
a cool nickname could be

976
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.390
Algernone-of-your-business-boy!

977
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.410
- Yeah. I noticed it didn't
work when I blanked her earlier.

978
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.143
- What?
- No AI now. no AI ever.

979
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.580
That's the platform that Sach's
about to win her reelection

980
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.510
on. and I'm willing to bet
Daddy's Little Princess

981
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:50.790
that all the world
leaders are in agreement.

982
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:52.960
Tyrimpson probably used The
Connection to strike a deal

983
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.080
with the aliens to get the
world leaders out of the way.

984
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.763
so he can initiate his sick robot fantasy.

985
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.080
That's a perfect plan.
a pretty genius one.

986
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.354
except for the fact that
he didn't count for me

987
00:59:03.354 --> 00:59:04.823
to be so fucking awesome
at being a detective.

988
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.990
Thank god for Roe v. Wade.

989
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:09.950
'cause we're about to shut this baby down.

990
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.590
What should we do?
- You're asking me?

991
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:14.510
- Can't always be the hero.

992
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.160
- Okay. I'm going to stay here.

993
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.410
and I'm going to try and find
signal so I can call Marge.

994
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:21.020
and tell her not to let
the leaders on the ship.

995
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.170
You should go and find Dr.
Tyrimpson. and stop him.

996
00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:24.480
before it's too late.

997
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.620
- Just like taking orders from a baby.

998
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.453
- Go!

999
00:59:29.106 --> 00:59:32.660
(tense dramatic music)
(alien squawking)

1000
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.570
- I understand that you're hungry.

1001
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.624
but you'll just have to wait
until they all board the ship.

1002
00:59:37.624 --> 00:59:39.020
(alien squawking)

1003
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.697
No. I don't know what
goes well with human.

1004
00:59:41.697 --> 00:59:42.829
(alien squawking)

1005
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:45.210
No. I don't think that
because I'm a human.

1006
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.150
I should know that.

1007
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:50.563
- It's not a galactic alliance.
it's a galactic buffet.

1008
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.850
- lIsten. 10 more minutes.

1009
00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.400
and you'll have all the
human rigatoni you can eat.

1010
00:59:58.872 --> 01:00:01.705
(watch whooshing)

1011
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:14.617
(tense ominous music)

1012
01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:29.290
- Come on. please.
(Serena gasping)

1013
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:30.790
- Chuck?

1014
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:31.623
What time is it?

1015
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.710
- 3:42 a.m.

1016
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:35.983
- We don't have much time.

1017
01:00:36.994 --> 01:00:37.827
- Okay.

1018
01:00:39.285 --> 01:00:40.760
(grunts) I'm assuming you're
up to speed on everything

1019
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.830
since you've made it this far.

1020
01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.260
but I guess the only thing you
probably haven't figured out

1021
01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.093
by now is how and why I'm here.

1022
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.987
Did you say it was 3:42 a.m.?

1023
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:51.520
- Yeah.
- Okay. god.

1024
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.380
it means we have about 10 minutes.

1025
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.130
let me just give you the quick version.

1026
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:59.670
Okay. so when Marge assigned
me to this case. I declined.

1027
01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.910
however I decided to do a
little bit of sleuthing.

1028
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.590
So I traced all the calls
from earth to space.

1029
01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:07.810
and I cross-referenced
them with all the calls

1030
01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.890
received from the
international space station.

1031
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:11.340
And all the calls that weren't.

1032
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.460
were coming from Tyrimpson's estate.

1033
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:16.890
So I came here to investigate.
found out his plan.

1034
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.680
but he stopped me before
I could do anything.

1035
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.620
So all we have to do
now is just call Marge.

1036
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.840
before the ship takes
off with the president.

1037
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.763
Unless of course. you already did that?

1038
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:32.273
- No. no. actually. I did not. but Serena.

1039
01:01:34.682 --> 01:01:39.680
Okay. Tyrimpson did
make a AI double of you.

1040
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.370
and I have been kind of
working with it all night.

1041
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:47.520
and it is sort of. like.

1042
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.233
right outside. and it said
it was gonna call Marge now.

1043
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.343
- Even though there's no
reception in the entire estate?

1044
01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.650
- Yeah. yeah. I kind of think that maybe

1045
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.070
it was lying using that as a distraction

1046
01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:06.137
so I wouldn't catch Tyrimpson.

1047
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.910
- Okay. well we need
to get The Connection.

1048
01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.650
Okay. here's the plan.

1049
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.380
You go and find Tyrimpson.
and distract him.

1050
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.305
just hold him off as long as possible.

1051
01:02:18.305 --> 01:02:20.220
- Okay. I can tell this joke I know.

1052
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.530
it's like a super long joke.

1053
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.500
it has like this really cool
build towards a punchline.

1054
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.100
so it's really long. it's
funny all the way through.

1055
01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.830
- Okay. okay. just stop him
from getting the orb. okay?

1056
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:31.950
- Okay. got it.

1057
01:02:32.906 --> 01:02:34.418
Okay. let's do it.

1058
01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.070
- I need a gun.

1059
01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:37.193
- Oh. right.

1060
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.730
Yeah. just--
- Daddy's Little Princess.

1061
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:43.600
- Don't pull the trigger until you--

1062
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.740
- Okay. thank you. Chuck.

1063
01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.780
Can you just go out there.

1064
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.710
and make it look like you
came from the outside.

1065
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:49.843
- Got it. okay.

1066
01:02:51.385 --> 01:02:54.635
(tense dramatic music)

1067
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:04.633
- Hey. Dr. Tyrimpson.
I'm sorry to bother you.

1068
01:03:06.697 --> 01:03:07.947
I think I left.

1069
01:03:10.905 --> 01:03:13.190
Hey. have you heard the one about the--

1070
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.253
- The agent who left his
partner behind to die?

1071
01:03:19.519 --> 01:03:20.923
- Hey. hey. let's just.

1072
01:03:22.212 --> 01:03:23.950
Okay. let's just take it easy Tyrimpson.

1073
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:26.640
- You know. Charles. I
gave you your chance.

1074
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.690
You could have just walked out of here.

1075
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:31.793
and everyone would've
lived happily ever after.

1076
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.805
Well not everyone. but you and Serena.

1077
01:03:36.805 --> 01:03:40.055
(tense dramatic music)

1078
01:03:41.106 --> 01:03:43.690
- Okay. let her go. let Serena go.

1079
01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:46.190
- Or what. you'll shoot
my girlfriend in the face?

1080
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.850
Oh wait. that's my thing.

1081
01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:52.220
So I think I'll be giving you orders here.

1082
01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.353
- Chuck. just do what he wants (sobs).

1083
01:03:55.973 --> 01:03:57.820
- What do you want.

1084
01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.613
- I want you to be the hero. Chuck.

1085
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.860
I'll give you a choice.

1086
01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.313
Either I kill you. or I kill Serena.

1087
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.260
Which will it be?

1088
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.280
- I got it. what if we did
like a half-daddy situation.

1089
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.963
like kill half of both of us?

1090
01:04:17.977 --> 01:04:19.570
You know. maybe like shoot
her in the arm and the leg.

1091
01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:20.946
you shoot me in the arm and leg.

1092
01:04:20.946 --> 01:04:23.590
and then you got a whole person.

1093
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.923
- You know.
- I.

1094
01:04:31.196 --> 01:04:34.446
(tense dramatic music)

1095
01:04:35.284 --> 01:04:38.393
(Serena grunting)

1096
01:04:38.393 --> 01:04:40.243
- You think you can kill me?

1097
01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:47.956
(gunshot booming)

1098
01:04:47.956 --> 01:04:48.956
- You can't.

1099
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.323
It's over.

1100
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:53.970
This is beyond you.

1101
01:04:56.925 --> 01:05:00.457
(spaceship whooshing)

1102
01:05:00.457 --> 01:05:01.790
This beyond you.

1103
01:05:07.569 --> 01:05:10.736
(tense ominous music)

1104
01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.480
- So what's your game?

1105
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.460
What. you're gonna save the world?

1106
01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.800
Couple of robot workers
will fix the economy?

1107
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.393
Make you millions of dollars?

1108
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.740
Is that what you served up
the president of The Agency

1109
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.463
like a hot. tasty Christmas goose?

1110
01:05:30.463 --> 01:05:35.463
(screen whooshing)
(light whirring)

1111
01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:39.500
Okay. judging by your reaction.

1112
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.740
I either misread your plan.

1113
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.040
or you're weirded out
by the hot. tasty thing.

1114
01:05:45.105 --> 01:05:48.355
(tense dramatic music)

1115
01:05:52.475 --> 01:05:55.225
- You're just like everyone else.

1116
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.773
You think this is all about money?

1117
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:03.953
Death.

1118
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.210
Have either of you ever
had a loved one die?

1119
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:11.160
- Yeah. but look I don't really
need the full speech. okay?

1120
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.143
- The human body is frail.

1121
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.980
One bacterium in the lungs.
one mutated cell in the brain.

1122
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:25.370
one explosion in your husband's
building. and darkness.

1123
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:29.153
The candle is snuffed out.

1124
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:35.063
You see. the body is the
mind's greatest weakness.

1125
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.433
that's why I'm bypassing it.

1126
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:42.553
Enter!
(boots marching)

1127
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.757
So I reveal my latest invention.

1128
01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.964
The Eternal Flame.

1129
01:06:54.964 --> 01:06:57.060
(light whirring)

1130
01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.740
One must simply upload their
consciousness to the program.

1131
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.230
and replace their fragile vessels

1132
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.430
with one of these new vehicles.

1133
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.350
Machines. really.

1134
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:12.180
Unable to contract disease.
unsusceptible to aging.

1135
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.600
and if the machine is destroyed.

1136
01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.823
simply redownload your
consciousness into a new machine.

1137
01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:22.623
(tense dramatic music)

1138
01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:27.487
(straps whooshing)

1139
01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:31.510
(helmet whirring)

1140
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.350
Did you expect the government to approve?

1141
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:38.030
I wouldn't let them build
an army of robot soldiers.

1142
01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:40.003
so they banned AI entirely.

1143
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.130
People riddled with depression and anxiety

1144
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.210
won't even take their medication

1145
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.750
for fear that it will alter their brains.

1146
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:53.026
did you really expect
them to voluntarily upload

1147
01:07:53.026 --> 01:07:56.823
their thoughts and dreams to the cloud?

1148
01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:59.340
(tense dramatic music)

1149
01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.660
After the ship leaves.
it will all be ready.

1150
01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.100
and these beauties will be free

1151
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.713
to find their fleshy counter
part and complete the process.

1152
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:15.700
These replacements. of course.

1153
01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.113
will not be taking your
consciousness. just your lives.

1154
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:23.053
Then they will follow me.

1155
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.903
And then. no more sadness.

1156
01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:32.121
No more.

1157
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:35.890
(machine whooshing)

1158
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.730
- Sorry. Chuck. the only problem with AI

1159
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:40.970
is they never say what they really mean.

1160
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:44.610
- Well. I'm sorry. 'cause
you're all out of time.

1161
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:47.320
- No. I'm sorry. you're out of time.

1162
01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.060
we have you surrounded.

1163
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.803
- Well. either way. somebody
is definitely out of time.

1164
01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.930
- Hey. Serena?
- What?

1165
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:58.750
- No. robot Serena.

1166
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.204
What's won backwards?

1167
01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.925
- Eno?
- No. like past tense of win.

1168
01:09:04.925 --> 01:09:05.930
- Now?

1169
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.849
(upbeat music)
(gunshots booming)

1170
01:09:08.849 --> 01:09:11.516
(all grunting)

1171
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:29.510
- We only have two minutes
until the ship leaves.

1172
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:32.270
- So shooting them is not gonna work.

1173
01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:36.922
(gunshots booming)

1174
01:09:41.896 --> 01:09:44.797
(magnet whooshing)

1175
01:09:44.797 --> 01:09:47.464
(both grunting)

1176
01:10:01.016 --> 01:10:03.933
(punches thudding)

1177
01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:08.530
- Go get The Connection!

1178
01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:11.197
(upbeat music)

1179
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.110
(gunshot booming)

1180
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.640
- I tell you. there's something
about knowing what I ate

1181
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.960
was killed that make me feel powerful.

1182
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:47.110
(upbeat music)
(pipe dripping)

1183
01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:59.530
(head thudding)
(Chuck grunting)

1184
01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:00.603
- Sorry buddy.

1185
01:11:07.231 --> 01:11:08.064
Ch

1186
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.030
(Chuck thudding)

1187
01:11:24.026 --> 01:11:29.026
(water pouring)
(robots buzzing)

1188
01:11:35.086 --> 01:11:38.336
Buddy.
(robot thudding)

1189
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.711
(uptempo triumphant music)

1190
01:11:44.711 --> 01:11:46.185
- What are you waiting for?
- Call Marge now!

1191
01:11:46.185 --> 01:11:47.018
- Okay.

1192
01:11:47.943 --> 01:11:50.120
Come on. Marge. pick up.
Marge. pick up. pick up.

1193
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.913
Come on Marge. pick up.

1194
01:11:51.913 --> 01:11:54.746
(chuck whooshing)

1195
01:11:55.993 --> 01:11:59.804
(tense dramatic music)

1196
01:11:59.804 --> 01:12:01.137
- [Marge] Hello?

1197
01:12:02.804 --> 01:12:04.970
(kick thudding)

1198
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:06.643
Marge. it's Serena. get.

1199
01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:09.513
- Me a souvenir from space!

1200
01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:11.749
- Okay.
- Get off the ship.

1201
01:12:11.749 --> 01:12:12.582
it's a trap.

1202
01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:17.080
Tyrimpson is selling the
president. and The Agency.

1203
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.513
- His products at discounted rates!

1204
01:12:19.513 --> 01:12:22.281
- [Marge] Listen. we're about to board.

1205
01:12:22.281 --> 01:12:23.364
Are you okay?

1206
01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.960
- [Woman] I said come with me.

1207
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.105
Please don't walk out on me. Chuck.

1208
01:12:29.105 --> 01:12:30.963
- Is this like a weird prank?
- I need you.

1209
01:12:32.438 --> 01:12:35.355
(Serena grunting)

1210
01:12:36.714 --> 01:12:39.310
- Listen. Tyrimpson is
making AI clones of everyone.

1211
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:41.890
and he's using the aliens
to get rid of the President.

1212
01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.400
and The Agency. and everyone.

1213
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.640
so he can replace everyone.

1214
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.550
You have to get off the ship.

1215
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.160
And before you ask me
if I'm an alien version.

1216
01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.780
or replicant of myself.

1217
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.640
Remember that time that
you went to Atlantic City.

1218
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.183
and we met that human tattoo.

1219
01:12:55.206 --> 01:12:57.347
- [Marge] Okay. that's enough.

1220
01:12:57.347 --> 01:13:00.930
Perez. we got a 2751 on our hands.

1221
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.530
get the President off that ship.

1222
01:13:06.322 --> 01:13:10.320
(Serena panting)
(Serena grunting)

1223
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.987
(water pouring)

1224
01:13:14.754 --> 01:13:17.506
- (blaring gibberish). Only 5.99!

1225
01:13:17.506 --> 01:13:19.706
I love you. Chuck!

1226
01:13:19.706 --> 01:13:23.373
01101110 01101111 (buzzes).

1227
01:13:25.305 --> 01:13:28.222
(robots whooshing)

1228
01:13:34.352 --> 01:13:37.102
- I've heard of be your own boss.

1229
01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.713
never beat your own boss.

1230
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:44.883
- You do not get to say a
line when I save the day.

1231
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:55.930
- Oh come on. you know you
couldn't have done it without me.

1232
01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:59.230
I mean I was over here
distracting Marge's fists

1233
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:01.859
with my face.

1234
01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:04.082
(Serena laughing)

1235
01:14:04.082 --> 01:14:05.093
- (sighs) Chuck.

1236
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.443
- Hey. why do you think we broke up?

1237
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:18.840
- Well. you were an asshole to
me the entire time we dated.

1238
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.180
You never treated me as your equal.

1239
01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.560
You had the Mayor killed.
because you refused to trust me.

1240
01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.470
And on top of all that.
after all that happened.

1241
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.323
you never once apologized to me.

1242
01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:35.809
- Yeah. cool. that's pretty
much what I thought too.

1243
01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:37.392
- [Robot] Complete.

1244
01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:42.125
(machine buzzing)

1245
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:51.720
(tense dramatic music)

1246
01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.173
- As you can see. I was
planning on you two being dead.

1247
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.463
Oh well. you should probably
just kill yourselves then.

1248
01:15:08.454 --> 01:15:09.700
- What?

1249
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.470
- Oh. right. sorry.

1250
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:15.000
it's pretty pointless to fight.

1251
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.520
because I've made myself far
less vulnerable to damage.

1252
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.010
and besides. my consciousness is copied.

1253
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:25.860
and stored in the cloud. so
even if you do destroy me.

1254
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.963
it'll just be redownloaded
into a new host body.

1255
01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:31.790
(gunshot booming)

1256
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:35.563
No. really. I wasn't joking.
I'm pretty much invincible.

1257
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:39.830
So. if you want to just kill yourselves.

1258
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:42.690
it would probably be less painful.

1259
01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:45.170
so I don't like accidentally
shoot your leg off.

1260
01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.130
and then you have to go crawling around.

1261
01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:49.300
in all that pain until I find you.

1262
01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:53.100
So if you wanna go ahead and do that.

1263
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.000
I can turn around.

1264
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:57.833
No?

1265
01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.613
Okay.

1266
01:16:00.494 --> 01:16:03.161
(gun whooshing)

1267
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:08.083
Isn't that symbolic.
- Daddy's Little Princess.

1268
01:16:10.854 --> 01:16:13.460
(machine whirring)

1269
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.880
I would say a line. but frankly.

1270
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.130
it's what. like close to four by now. so.

1271
01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:23.575
(tense dramatic music)

1272
01:16:23.575 --> 01:16:27.242
I am very tired (chuckles).

1273
01:16:29.114 --> 01:16:31.725
Well. isn't that cute.

1274
01:16:31.725 --> 01:16:34.642
(gunshots booming)

1275
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.768
(teleporter whirring)

1276
01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:45.601
No!

1277
01:16:46.619 --> 01:16:49.835
(device whirring)

1278
01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:52.585
(device buzzing)

1279
01:16:54.726 --> 01:16:56.309
- [Robot] Complete.

1280
01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.830
- Do you wanna say one?

1281
01:17:03.062 --> 01:17:05.038
- Ne.
- Come on. give it a shot.

1282
01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:07.221
- It's not my thing.

1283
01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:08.054
- Come on.

1284
01:17:08.973 --> 01:17:12.056
- (sighs) All right.

1285
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:15.433
- You're snow-more Tyrimpson.

1286
01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:20.863
- Because of the snow globe?
- Yeah.

1287
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:26.170
- Yeah. it really isn't your thing. is it?

1288
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.020
- Still saved the day though.
- Yip.

1289
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:32.830
Good job tonight.

1290
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.645
Just like old times?

1291
01:17:35.645 --> 01:17:39.312
(uptempo sentimental music)

1292
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:43.997
(both laughing)

1293
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.180
- We're just friends. by the way. Chuck.

1294
01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.486
- Yeah. right.
- Yeah.

1295
01:17:52.486 --> 01:17:53.903
- Mark. Kathleen?

1296
01:18:01.517 --> 01:18:04.373
Did you guys kill Dr. Tyrimpson?

1297
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.630
Oh no. we just

1298
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.653
downloaded him?

1299
01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:12.524
- [Tyrimpson] No!

1300
01:18:13.475 --> 01:18:15.540
- Does this mean I don't have a job again?

1301
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.070
- Hey. you know what?

1302
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:19.620
Actually I think I might
know someone who's hiring.

1303
01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:28.619
(phone ringing)

1304
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:42.130
- Hello?

1305
01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.950
- [Stokes] Hey guys. Stokes here.

1306
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:45.280
I just wanted to let you
guys know to get your butts

1307
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.113
back down to The Agency.

1308
01:18:46.113 --> 01:18:47.790
'cause we're throwing a party for you.

1309
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.160
It was supposed to be a surprise.

1310
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.117
but then two people walked
in that looked like you.

1311
01:18:52.117 --> 01:18:53.567
and we were like. "Surprise!"

1312
01:18:54.828 --> 01:18:56.028
- You ready for a party?

1313
01:18:57.038 --> 01:19:00.371
(uptempo dubstep music)

1314
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.553
- Hey. actually wait a second.

1315
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.754
How much do you think this thing is worth?

1316
01:19:09.754 --> 01:19:13.421
- [Serena] (sighs) Come on.

1317
01:19:19.834 --> 01:19:24.165
(all applauding)
(all cheering)

1318
01:19:24.165 --> 01:19:26.665
- Good job. guys.
- You did it.

1319
01:19:35.014 --> 01:19:36.785
- It's okay that you
didn't solve the case.

1320
01:19:36.785 --> 01:19:38.690
- It's okay that you
didn't solve the case!

1321
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:41.810
- I still love you so much.
- I think that this failure

1322
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.983
has actually made me love you even more.

1323
01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:47.579
(lips smacking)

1324
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:52.369
- And it tells time. unless
you know how to use it!

1325
01:19:52.369 --> 01:19:54.339
(gunshot booming)
(person screaming)

1326
01:19:54.339 --> 01:19:56.150
- Then what does it do?

1327
01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:58.650
- The Three Musketeers.
and sometimes. Perez.

1328
01:19:58.650 --> 01:19:59.730
back together again.

1329
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:01.570
It's good to have you back. Chuck.

1330
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:04.510
- Yeah. but me and Serena
were just partners.

1331
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:07.010
not like. you know. partner-partners.

1332
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:10.330
- Yeah. obviously. as if
she'd ever take you back.

1333
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.950
- Okay.

1334
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:14.090
- Hey. whatever happened to Sachs?

1335
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.580
- Oh. she had to go. you
know. president things.

1336
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.773
But she did want me to give
this to you as a thank you.

1337
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:26.291
(angelic choral music)

1338
01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.573
- Gerbils.

1339
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.113
- I just wanted to--

1340
01:20:33.113 --> 01:20:36.590
- [All] Say something
random to get us to shut up.

1341
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:37.423
- Yeah.

1342
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.116
Hey. between you and me. I'm
really rooting for you guys.

1343
01:20:43.116 --> 01:20:46.449
(uptempo dubstep music)

1344
01:20:53.493 --> 01:20:54.326
Gross.

1345
01:20:58.290 --> 01:20:59.190
- I almost forgot.

1346
01:21:03.035 --> 01:21:06.035
(picture whooshing)

1347
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.580
Hey Chuck. whatever
happened to your hurt hand?

1348
01:21:11.554 --> 01:21:14.143
- Oh. it must've healed by itself.

1349
01:21:15.077 --> 01:21:17.670
The power of friendship.
(cash register dinging)

1350
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:22.670
- Okay. how about a toast
to Chuck and Serena?

1351
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.398
- [All] To Chuck and Serena!

1352
01:21:24.398 --> 01:21:29.075
- Director Daniels. Director
Daniels. Director Daniels.

1353
01:21:29.075 --> 01:21:30.975
Are you guys having a party right now?

1354
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.683
Sorry to interrupt Marge.

1355
01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:38.950
New Orleans PD just called.

1356
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.000
they got reports of dead bodies

1357
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.970
walking around the graveyards.

1358
01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:45.033
and they need agents. stack.

1359
01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:47.973
- You guys in?

1360
01:21:49.274 --> 01:21:50.670
- What do you say?

1361
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:52.120
- We break the arrest record.

1362
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.740
- Count us in. Marge.

1363
01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.513
but. first. there's
something we need to do.

1364
01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:06.340
(camera shuttering)
(uptempo punk music)

1365
01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.913
- Hey. I'm here with Serena
Foz. and Chuckles. Chuckles.

1366
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:18.670
What is it?
- Chuck Lawson.

1367
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:21.390
- Chuck Lawson. they just saved the world.

1368
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:23.260
and they're here to talk about it.

1369
01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.783
One thing that I ask all my
guests that saved the world.

1370
01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:29.080
you must have a story. you must have a.

1371
01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.858
just a great story.
- Do we?

1372
01:22:30.858 --> 01:22:31.820
- Yeah. as a matter of fact.

1373
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.790
no. actually it's mostly just kicking ass

1374
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:34.950
all the time.

1375
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.710
You know nothing real funny about it.

1376
01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:38.740
- We punched out a pizza guy.

1377
01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:43.190
- So. let's say they are
making a movie about all this.

1378
01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:44.940
about saving the world--
- Oh wow.

1379
01:22:46.090 --> 01:22:49.233
- Who are they casting.
who's Chuck and Serena?

1380
01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:55.142
- I think I would have
to go with Chenga Carlson

1381
01:22:55.142 --> 01:22:57.110
from the Carlson twins. you know?

1382
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:58.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1383
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:00.113
- The great William Shakespeare.

1384
01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.210
- William Shakespeare?
- William Shakespeare.

1385
01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.273
- All right. bold choice.
- Great actor of yesteryear.

1386
01:23:06.534 --> 01:23:08.461
- He's a writer.
- Writer.

1387
01:23:08.461 --> 01:23:10.219
- Well. he did all kinds of things.

1388
01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:11.740
he was very versatile in all of his skits.

1389
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.573
- Sure.

1390
01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.230
- Hi. I'm Chuck Lawson.
- And I'm Serena Fox.

1391
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:19.180
- And when we're done saving the world.

1392
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.964
- We always reach for
a peanut butter chongo.

1393
01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:25.956
- [Both] Yum. yum. yum.
yum. yum. yum. Chongos.

1394
01:23:25.956 --> 01:23:29.039
(uptempo punk music)

1395
