but you have to finish
the entire course.

I want you to make
me feel better. Doc.

You are still a medical
professional. right?

72
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.138
Or have you finally crossed
over and become one of us?

73

provided the whole world

I still wouldn't
be trash like you.

- Come on now.

77
00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:39.502
I was just tickling
your funny bone.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.333
Your material sucks.

80
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.816
- Well. don't disparage
my sucking skills. Doc.

81
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:52.776

but you know that
Lisa's here to see you.

91
00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:31.598
- Give me a minute.

92
00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:35.471
All right. get up.

93

And next time. don't
dress like a slut.

101
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.144

show that really gives a shit

there. in our neighborhoods

109
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:21.735
and all across the
pill-plagued USA.

110
00:09:22.823 --> 00:09:24.955
We're in trouble. folks.

111
00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.523
Our communities are being
decimated by a plague

112
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.874
of drug abuse and dependence.
so we come together

113
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.007
here on the worldwide web.

114
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:36.097
as a community. as a family.

115
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:39.013
We share our pain
and our heartbreak.

116
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.711
but to tell our stories.

117
00:09:43.278 --> 00:09:46.324
Stories of a cancer
that's killing and
maiming our children.

War.

00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:50.938
We're at war.

120
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:57.118
War with an insidious enemy
that's making billions

121
00:09:58.206 --> 00:10:00.774
and destroying millions
of innocent lives.

122
00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:05.169

Lori from Lutz is on the line.

126
00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:18.748
She has a story to tell.

127
00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.315
Talk to me. Lori.

128
00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:22.709
- [Lori] Hi. Bill. how are you?

129
00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:24.493
- I could be better. Lori.

130
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.277
We could be better.

131
00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:28.410
These corporate
scumbags are destroying

132
00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:30.151
the future of our children.

133
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.370
What's your story?

134
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.243
- [Lori] My son died
last year just as he

135
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.072
was about to graduate
from college.

136
00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:41.597
These kids can get
pills so easily.

137
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.252
He wasn't an addict.

138
00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:49.083
He was graduating with a 4.0
from the University of Tampa.

139
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.215
One night. he was
drinking with his friends

140
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:53.261
and they were taking
these painkillers.

141
00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:58.266
My son passed out and
they said he threw up

142
00:10:58.353 --> 00:10:59.528
while he was on his back.

143
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:04.315
No one saw him.
and he suffocated.

144
00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:09.016
And I miss him so much.

145
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.497
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:17.415
- No. no. no. now none of that
I'm sorry stuff allowed here.

147
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:19.243
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

148
00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:23.334
It's the monsters who
are pushing this poison.

149
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:25.075
They're the ones
who oughta be sorry.

150
00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:26.816
Will be sorry.

151
00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:31.865
You got any idea where the
kids were getting the stuff?

152
00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:33.518
- [Lori] We don't know for sure.

153
00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:35.303
One of his friends said
there was a younger student

154
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.218
whose brother was a dealer.

155
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.048
- Police ever follow
up on that lead?

156
00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:43.790
- [Lori] We never
heard anything.

157
00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:44.704
- That's typical.

158
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.882
The problem's too
big for any local

159
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.405
police department anyway.

160
00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:54.191
Thanks for calling in.
Lori. It's gonna get better.

161
00:11:56.803 --> 00:11:59.370

[balls colliding]

164
00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:10.033
- Last year was a great year.

165
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.295
This year's better.

166
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:15.299
Considering we only spent
two million lobbying.

167
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.694
the ROI is insane.

168
00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:24.178
- You know. I keep
hearing they're going
after doctors next.

169
00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:25.092
- They are.

170
00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:27.834
And they'll throw a
few to the wolves.

171
00:12:29.226 --> 00:12:30.314
Optics matter.

172
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:33.100
Don't worry. Sport.

173
00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:37.017
You're not in danger.
You're too damn white.

174
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:41.673
What's the situation
with your ex-partner?

175
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.545
We need him to sign off.

176
00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:45.590
- I'm working on it.

177
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.854
- Work harder.

178
00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:52.641
If there's one thing I've
always lacked. it's patience.

179

00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.802
- [Bill] Why do you
assume I'm selling?

185
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:32.550
- Can you believe
that the captain

186
00:13:32.637 --> 00:13:34.422
made us go to that
dirtbag's funeral?

187
00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:37.512
- Why'd he do that?

188
00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:41.690
- Kelly wrote a check for
the mayor's reelection.

189
00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:44.432
He said the department
should pay its respects.

190
00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:49.176
- Did you catch the
show last night?

191
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:52.875
- It's so sad.

[birds calling]

193
00:13:59.447 --> 00:14:00.230
- So?

194
00:14:01.188 --> 00:14:03.016
You got anything on it?

195
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:05.932
- I'll see what I can do.

214
00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:47.789
Do I know you. brother?

215
00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:50.009
- Doesn't matter.

216
00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:52.272
I know you.

217
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.926
- Really?

218
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:58.974
Then I imagine
you're after this.

219
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:02.847
- Did you ever stop to think

220
00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:06.199
about the lives
you've ruined. Rip?

221
00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:09.376
- What is this?

222
00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:10.768
Who the hell are you?

223
00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:14.511
- Your guidance counselor.

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:08.087
- Can I help you?

231
00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:09.088
- Dr. Mac?

232
00:18:10.437 --> 00:18:12.961
- Yeah. well. I used to be.

233
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:13.875
Who are you?

234
00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:16.138
- It's me. Bill Johnson.

235
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:20.186
You operated on me after my
heart attack a few years back.

236
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:22.188
- Oh. yeah. Bill.

237
00:18:22.275 --> 00:18:24.190
Been a while. hasn't it?

238
00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:25.930
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you.

239
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:29.891
What are you doing way out here?

240
00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:32.023
Hope it's not for a checkup.

241
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:32.894
- No.

242
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:36.115
- Well. then what
can I do for you?

243
00:18:37.855 --> 00:18:39.292
Sorry about the mess. Bill.

244
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:43.122
I wasn't exactly
expecting visitors.

245
00:18:44.427 --> 00:18:45.298
But come on in.

246
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:51.956
Tell me something.

247
00:18:54.002 --> 00:18:55.569
How the hell did you find me?

248
00:18:56.657 --> 00:18:58.528
- I saw online you've
been suspended.

249
00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.357
I can find anybody
on the computer.

250
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:05.144
- Damn computers
... I hate them.

251
00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:08.147
It's one of the reasons
I'm in this mess.

252
00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:11.889
You know. I appreciate you
coming all the way out here.

253
00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:14.327
but what exactly do you want?

254
00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:16.720
- I don't know.

255
00:19:18.113 --> 00:19:19.897
I wanna lend you some
support. I guess.

256
00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:22.030
You did save my life.

257
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.730
- Yeah. I've saved
a lotta lives.

258
00:19:27.644 --> 00:19:29.385
Look where it's gotten me.

259
00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:31.605
You know. unless you're a lawyer

260
00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.172
or a medical billing expert.

261
00:19:34.477 --> 00:19:37.350
I'm not sure there's
anything you can do for me.

262
00:19:37.437 --> 00:19:38.264
- Maybe not.

263
00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:42.050
- [Tom] How about
a bowl of cereal?

264
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:43.399
- Sure.

265
00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:44.313
- All right.

266
00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:46.924
It's the least I can do for you.

267
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.753
coming all the way
out here. have a seat.

268
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.930
- There are more than
70.000 overdose deaths

269
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:55.194
each year in this country.

270
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:56.543
70.000.

271
00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:02.026
Most people still envision big
boats smuggling in the dope.

272
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:04.203
low-level dealers
selling it on the street.

273
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.162
and yeah. that still goes
on. but the real culprits.

274
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:12.211
it's the pharmaceutical
companies. the
doctors they grease.

275
00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:15.170
[gun firing]

00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:18.391
[soft dramatic music]

277
00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:29.271
They're overprescribing
this shit.

278
00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:31.012
It's ruining our communities.

279
00:20:31.926 --> 00:20:35.103

280
00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:39.629
[insects buzzing]

281
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:49.683
If you've lost a loved one
to an overdose. call in.

282
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.988
Let's hear your story.

283
00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:53.382
Talk to me. caller.

284
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:54.775
- [Caller] Yeah. Bill.

285
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:56.429
what happened to
personal responsibility?

286
00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:59.519
Nobody. nobody's forcing
these losers to pop pills.

287
00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:01.956
Why is it the doctor's
fault if they're weak-kneed?

288
00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:02.870
- Losers?

289
00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:06.047
That's how you
see these victims?

290
00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:07.962
- [Caller] Well. well.

291
00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:12.532
- My best friend on this
earth had a bad knee.

292
00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.274
went in for a knee replacement.

293
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:17.754
Lotta post-surgical pain.

294
00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:19.930
Doctor prescribed Oxycodone.

295
00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:23.151
This is a guy who never took
a drink. never took a drug.

296
00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:26.154
Within six weeks.
he was addicted.

297
00:21:26.241 --> 00:21:28.504
Six months after the surgery.

298
00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:31.464
dead of an overdose.

299
00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.293
You wanna call him weak. hmm?

300
00:21:35.772 --> 00:21:37.992
Did two tours of
duty in Vietnam.

301
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:42.562
Started his own business.
was a self-made millionaire.

302
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:46.435
raised four kids. married
40 years to the same woman.

303
00:21:46.522 --> 00:21:47.741
He was no loser.

304
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:50.396
He was a great American.

305
00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:56.576
And if this scourge can take
him. it can take anybody.

306
00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:00.841
[groaning]

307
00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:02.756
- What's this about. Friend?

308
00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:04.323
I have done nothing to you.

309
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.456
- This isn't about you.

310
00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:09.850
This is about the
kids whose lives

311
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.330
your company helped erase.

312
00:22:12.592 --> 00:22:14.855
- What are you talking about?

313
00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:17.336
I never erased anything.

314
00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:18.337
I have a family.

315
00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:20.948
I have kids.

316
00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:22.253
- So did I.

322

- My God.

323
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.379
Are you insane?

324
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.643
I couldn't afford to pay
this even if I was working.

325
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.473
and as you know. I'm not.
thanks to your new boyfriend.

326
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.996
- Bullshit.

327
00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:10.606
You could be making a
lot more if you wanted.

328
00:23:10.693 --> 00:23:12.826
but you've always lacked
ambition and drive.

329
00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:15.002
- We were doing fine.

330
00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:18.832
I just wanted to be a
doctor ... and help people.

331
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.660
I guess that's my big crime.

332
00:23:20.747 --> 00:23:23.314
I don't care about being rich.

333
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:24.620
- Well I do.

334
00:23:24.707 --> 00:23:26.187
I deserve more than
you can give me.

335
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:28.885
- Oh. yeah. The world owes Lisa.

336
00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:32.498
Rhodes promise you a mansion
in Shangrila. did he?

337
00:23:32.585 --> 00:23:34.674
- I don't even
know where that is.

338
00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:38.417
Look. I'm not settling.

339
00:23:38.504 --> 00:23:39.983
Okay. I want it all.

340
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.377
You're a criminal. and
you're going to prison.

341
00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:44.248
You won't need money in there.

342
00:23:44.335 --> 00:23:46.686
- My God. you're demonic.

343
00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:48.949
You two deserve each other.

344
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:50.559
- Leave Alan out of this.

345
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:52.474
It's between you and me.

346
00:23:52.561 --> 00:23:57.305
- Look. even if I go to jail.
it's not gonna be for long.

347
00:23:57.392 --> 00:23:59.916
I have to be able to
live when I get out.

348
00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:01.527
- Jesus Christ.
you're a smart guy.

349
00:24:01.614 --> 00:24:04.051
I'm sure you'll find
a way to scrape by.

350
00:24:04.138 --> 00:24:06.967
- Scrape by? Are you
listening to yourself?

351
00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:11.058
A few months ago. we were fine.

352
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:13.887
We were planning our
future. we were happy.

353
00:24:13.974 --> 00:24:14.888
And now you wanna.

354
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:19.283
you wanna kick me to the
side like a piece of garbage.

355
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:22.809
- I'm just ... over it.

356
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.813
I've been unhappy
for a long time.

357
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:29.642
Alan makes me happy.

358
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:34.864
- Yeah. Alan's made
a lotta women happy.

359
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:37.867
in the past. for
about five minutes.

360
00:24:37.954 --> 00:24:40.304
You know he's been
divorced four times?

361
00:24:40.391 --> 00:24:42.002
You're just a pit stop.

362
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:43.177
- Enough about him.

363
00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:47.311
If you can be reasonable.
we can get this over with.

364
00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:48.225
- Reasonable?

365
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:50.967
You don't want me
to get anything.

366
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:53.056
You want the house. the cars.

367
00:24:53.143 --> 00:24:55.276
the bank accounts.
the investments.

368
00:24:55.363 --> 00:24:58.497
How the hell is this reasonable?

369
00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:02.022
[whispering]

370
00:25:07.244 --> 00:25:08.071
- Tell you what.

371
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:12.467
You can keep your damn
car and your 401k.

372
00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:14.425
if you just sign over
the patent to me.

373
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:15.731
I'm already entitled
to half of it.

374
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:17.124
It's a mere formality.

375
00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:20.214
- There it is. isn't it?

376
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.955
The truth emerges.

377
00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:25.001
The patent ... Rhodes put
you up to his. didn't he?

378
00:25:25.088 --> 00:25:26.829
- He did no such thing.

379
00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:29.963
That's my offer.
Take it or leave it.

380
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.487
You don't agree. then
set a trial date.

381
00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:45.805
[machines humming]

382
00:25:49.025 --> 00:25:51.027
[birds singing]

383
00:25:51.114 --> 00:25:52.594
- [Alan] Ow. fuck.

384
00:25:58.644 --> 00:26:02.212
[knocking on door]

385
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:05.259
[knocking on door]

386
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:10.917
[knocking on door]

387
00:26:17.097 --> 00:26:18.533
- Good God. it's you.

388
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:20.927
- That's a warm welcome.

389
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:23.494
- You got a lotta
nerve showing up here.

390
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.193
I'm surprised you even knew
about this side of town.

391
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.152
- You kidding me? I grew
up on this side of town.

392
00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:31.938
- Yeah. another new car. huh?

393
00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:33.461
- She's a beauty. isn't she?

394
00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:35.681
- Yeah. sure. whatever.

395
00:26:38.988 --> 00:26:40.686
[door closing]

396
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:42.688
How the hell did
you find me anyway?

397
00:26:43.906 --> 00:26:45.691
Was my address on a
billboard somewhere?

398
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:48.476
Oh wait. I know. Lisa.

399
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:51.914
- Yeah. it was on the
divorce papers. Tom.

400
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.481
- Yeah.

401
00:26:53.568 --> 00:26:55.439
All right. well what the
hell do you really want?

402
00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:57.964
As if I didn't know.

403
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.705
- I came to see you
on your birthday.

404
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:01.054
I even got you something.

405
00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.665
- God.

406
00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:06.146
It is my birthday. isn't it?

407
00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:07.538
What is it?

408
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:08.801
Hell. you don't know.

409
00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:10.759
Looks re-gifted from Christmas.

410
00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:15.721
Look. we both know why you're
here. okay. so save it.

411
00:27:15.808 --> 00:27:17.244
- Hear me out. Tom.

412
00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:19.028
- Hear you out.

413
00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:22.597
What could you possibly say
that you haven't said before?

414
00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:24.817
Did somebody invent
some new words?

415
00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:26.688
You steal my wife. you set me up

416
00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:28.168
with the medical
board. and then you--

417
00:27:28.255 --> 00:27:29.996
- Wait a minute. wait a minute.

418
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.737
I had nothing to do with your
fraudulent billing practices.

419
00:27:31.824 --> 00:27:35.305
And I did not steal your
wife. She came to me begging.

420
00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:40.006
Hell. Tom. I want
you to come back.

421
00:27:40.093 --> 00:27:41.834
You did most of the work anyway.

422
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:44.706
- That's horseshit.
and you know it.

423
00:27:44.793 --> 00:27:46.926
There's one thing that you
want. and you know what it is.

424
00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:49.450
and I know what it is. and
that's why you're here.

425
00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:50.930
To hell with my birthday.

426
00:27:51.017 --> 00:27:53.454
- There is a fortune
to be made. dude.

427
00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:55.717
Just sign the patent over to me.

428
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:58.154
The FDA will never
approve it with your name.

429
00:27:58.241 --> 00:28:00.766
especially if you
lose your license.

430
00:28:00.853 --> 00:28:04.117
And I will guarantee you'll
get your share of the profits.

431
00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:05.031
Come on.

432
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:11.298
- It's not about the
money. You know that.

433
00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:14.214
Okay. I want this drug
to help heart patients.

434
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:16.390
not to be marketed
as another opioid.

435
00:28:16.477 --> 00:28:18.522
There's enough of that
shit in the market now.

436
00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:21.656
- It's gonna help a small
percentage of heart patients.

437
00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:23.484
- I don't care.

438
00:28:23.571 --> 00:28:26.617
- But. as a painkiller. every
man. woman and child on Earth

439
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.663
will be a potential
customer. Tom.

440
00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:32.449
- Get outta my house. now.

441
00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:34.495
[dramatic music]

442
00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:36.018
Get outta my house.

443
00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:39.369
- This is gonna happen
one way or the other.

444
00:28:39.456 --> 00:28:40.675
It's gonna happen. Tom.

445
00:28:40.762 --> 00:28:43.112
[choking]

446
00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:44.287
- Get off me.

447
00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:46.507
[coughing]

448
00:28:46.594 --> 00:28:49.336
[dramatic music]

449
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:55.255
- [Alan] Smug son of a prick.

450
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:06.048
- Did you know one of the
biggest opioid manufacturers

451
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:08.485
in this country is
a family business?

452
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:12.098
Family business.

453
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.581
Wonder how many of
their family members

454
00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:19.105
ever use their product. hm?

455
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.545
Gosh. I wonder how
many politicians'
kids ever go to war.

456
00:29:25.938 --> 00:29:26.808
Politicians.

457
00:29:28.636 --> 00:29:31.204
I never had no faith in
them anyway. but these days.

458
00:29:33.597 --> 00:29:36.078
So there's all kinds
of pushers. right?

459
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.515
From the guy on the
corner to the cartel.

460
00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.779
They all do the same damage.
They all destroy families.

461
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:43.259
They all take children
away from their families.

462
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:46.654
But lately I been thinking.

463
00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:51.790
Maybe the worst pushers are
the institutionalized ones.

464
00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:55.794
The ones who lobby
Congress to write the laws.

465
00:29:56.925 --> 00:29:58.579
Police do what they can.

466
00:29:58.666 --> 00:30:01.756
but how do you fight a
pusher who's been legalized?

467
00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:04.237
Politicians won't do shit.

468
00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:05.804
They're the ones who
helped opioids become

469
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.893
big business in the first place.

470
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.331
So what are we gonna do about
the legalized pushers. hm?

471
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.986
Appeal to their better nature?

472
00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:16.727
They got no better nature.

473
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:20.340
Ask them to obey the laws?

474
00:30:20.427 --> 00:30:22.646
They write the damn laws.

475
00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:26.346
Beg them for common decency?
They're all indecent.

476
00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:29.001
So what are we gonna do?

477
00:30:29.088 --> 00:30:31.873
What are we the people
gonna do about this?

478
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.964
Talk to me. caller.

479
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:37.661
- [Caller] Bill. we should
put our faith in our Lord

480
00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:39.402
and Savior. Jesus Christ.

481
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:42.928
He will come down from
heaven and show us the way.

482
00:30:43.015 --> 00:30:45.931
- There's an old adage I
try to live by. Friend.

483
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:50.805
Pray every day as if
everything depends on God.

484
00:30:50.892 --> 00:30:54.548
Act every day as if
everything depends on you.

485
00:30:55.897 --> 00:30:56.855
Thanks for the call.

486
00:30:58.508 --> 00:31:01.163
We gotta go. I'll see
you good folks next time.

487
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.949
Till then. be good. do
good. keep the faith.

488
00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.212
I love you. Ashley. See ya.

489
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:09.215

[knocking on door]

493
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.895
- [Jan] Go away. We aint buying.

494
00:31:38.418 --> 00:31:40.028
- [Bill] I am still not selling.

495
00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:44.641
- [Jan] It's not
like you to be late.

496
00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:51.126
- I'm sorry. I was
visiting Ashley.

497
00:31:51.213 --> 00:31:54.347
[soft dramatic music]

498
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.005
- Jan. is this every
gonna get easier?

499
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:00.875
- It will. Bill.

500
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:03.138
It'll just be different.

501
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.271
The new normal.

502
00:32:06.968 --> 00:32:09.014
Pain is the price we
pay for our memories.

503
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.018
- I wanna keep fighting.
long as I got fight in me.

504
00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:15.977
But I'm not blameless.

505
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.983
Why didn't I see the
pain she was in? Hm?

506
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:26.118
Why wasn't she prepared
for the dangers?

507
00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:29.208
What I do wrong?

508
00:32:29.295 --> 00:32:30.818
I coulda been a better father.

509
00:32:32.689 --> 00:32:34.561
[birds calling]

510
00:32:34.648 --> 00:32:37.259
- I been working vice
a really long time.

511
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:40.001
and I have never seen as
much death as I have lately.

512
00:32:41.307 --> 00:32:43.962
Kids dying for nothing
over these damn drugs.

513
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:54.537
- You got some names
and numbers for me?

514
00:32:56.887 --> 00:32:58.237
- Don't I always?

515
00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:02.545
[grunting]

516
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:15.123
- Really?

[groaning]

519
00:33:24.698 --> 00:33:28.267
- Hey ... give these
to your granddaughter.

520
00:33:28.354 --> 00:33:30.095
That middle school
will be a money tree

521
00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:31.618
if we can get in
there and move these.

522
00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:34.751
- Hm. I need a
bigger cut. Trent.

523
00:33:34.838 --> 00:33:37.276
I want a bonus. in advance.

524
00:33:37.363 --> 00:33:39.974
- Fuck you. I just gave
you your bonus. Maude.

525
00:33:40.061 --> 00:33:42.759
- Shit. that was
your bonus. Sunshine.

526
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:43.978
I didn't get shit.

527

[gun cocking]

528
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:47.416
- Middle schools. Maude?

529
00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:48.374
- Jesus.

530
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.987
- Not exactly making
America great again. are we?

531
00:33:54.075 --> 00:33:55.424
- You fu--

- Hey. man. we're cool.
right. we're cool?

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.756
That was pathetic.

00:34:22.843 --> 00:34:25.324
[whimpering]

540
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:26.760
Wanna try again?

541
00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:31.025
- Have mercy.

542
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:31.939
- I will.

543
00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:34.420
- No!

544
00:34:34.507 --> 00:34:37.292
[gun firing twice]

545
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:40.078
[dramatic music]

546
00:34:42.036 --> 00:34:44.430
[gun firing]

547
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.868
- [Bill] Until you have a
child. you can never imagine

548
00:34:47.955 --> 00:34:49.870
the love that you
feel for your child.

549
00:34:51.654 --> 00:34:54.831
Nor can you ever
imagine the pain.

550
00:34:56.485 --> 00:34:59.401
The gut-wrenching pain
of losing that child.

551
00:35:02.274 --> 00:35:04.754
And the love we have
for our children.

552
00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:06.626
it's the strongest
emotion on Earth.

553
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:09.803
- What the fuck?

554
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.674
[gun firing]

555
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:14.286
The bond between
parent and child.

556
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:18.812
God. it's so strong you
could pull a battleship.

557
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:23.991
[soft dramatic music]

558
00:35:24.078 --> 00:35:25.732
And in a matter of seconds.

559
00:35:25.819 --> 00:35:28.343
your whole world's ripped
right out from under you.

560
00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:32.042
[gun firing]

561
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.568
[splashing]

562
00:35:40.399 --> 00:35:42.401
There's no experience on Earth

563
00:35:42.488 --> 00:35:44.794
that prepares you for
the loss of your child.

564
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:50.844
There's an emptiness inside
you that can't be filled.

565
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.457
Thoughts of suicide ... well.
they become a daily ritual.

566
00:35:56.893 --> 00:36:00.201
I don't just grieve when I
think of the things we did.

567
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:05.728
I grieve when I think of
the things we'll never do.

568
00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:08.818
Add up all the successes
and accomplishments

569
00:36:08.905 --> 00:36:11.212
and love you've
had in your life.

570
00:36:11.299 --> 00:36:13.519

[gun firing]

573
00:36:21.701 --> 00:36:23.877
They crumble beneath
the weight of the pain

574
00:36:25.008 --> 00:36:26.488
of losing your child.

575
00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:28.664
[soft dramatic music]

576
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:32.451
I'd give up my life
right now. no hesitation.

577
00:36:32.538 --> 00:36:34.583
if I could hold her
just one more time.

578
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:39.066
[soft dramatic music]

579
00:37:30.683 --> 00:37:32.902

[soft dramatic music]

595
00:39:30.716 --> 00:39:34.154
See a woman who loses
a husband is a widow.

596
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.549
Man who loses his
wife is a widower.

597
00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:42.467
A child who loses a
parent is an orphan. but

598
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:47.559
there's no word for a parent

599
00:39:48.603 --> 00:39:50.170
who loses a child.

600
00:39:50.257 --> 00:39:52.955
[dramatic music]

601
00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:04.750
[birds singing]

602
00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:08.406
- [Tom] My God. Bill. it
is beautiful out here.

603
00:40:09.885 --> 00:40:11.670
Thanks for inviting me.

604
00:40:11.757 --> 00:40:13.672
- [Bill] You're welcome.

605
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:16.370
- You've really done
well for yourself.

606
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:17.850
What do you do?

607
00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:20.722
- A little of this.
little of that.

608
00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:22.420
- Okay [chuckles].

609
00:40:22.507 --> 00:40:25.031
Well. whatever it
is you're doing.

610
00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:26.989
you're doing better
than I am at the moment.

611
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.906
Say. I caught your
talk show last night.

612
00:40:30.993 --> 00:40:31.951
You're very good.

613
00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:34.301
- Thank you.

614
00:40:34.388 --> 00:40:35.520
It's my passion.

615
00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:38.827
- I applaud the effort.

616
00:40:38.914 --> 00:40:39.698
Why this cause?

617
00:40:42.222 --> 00:40:43.441
- My daughter passed away.

618
00:40:46.095 --> 00:40:47.445
- Jesus. I'm sorry.

619
00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:50.448
What happened?

620
00:40:52.624 --> 00:40:53.538
- Overdose.

621
00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:57.803
- [Tom] What was she taking?

622
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.326
- Painkillers.

623
00:40:59.413 --> 00:41:00.153
- God.

624
00:41:01.284 --> 00:41:03.722
Why does this not surprise me?

625
00:41:06.507 --> 00:41:07.465
- [Bill] What do you mean?

626
00:41:09.162 --> 00:41:10.642
- They're everywhere. Bill.

627
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:13.079
Anybody can get
their hands on them.

628
00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:15.647
And they're stronger today
than they've ever been.

629
00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:19.433
That certainly
explains your crusade.

630
00:41:21.783 --> 00:41:24.264
And the reason I'm about
to lose my medical license.

631
00:41:25.657 --> 00:41:26.745
- How's that?

632
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:29.965
- Well you see. I've
developed a drug

633
00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:31.924
to help heart
transplant patients.

634
00:41:32.011 --> 00:41:33.012
That's my passion.

635
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.712
But in a higher dosage. it's
more powerful than fentanyl.

636
00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:40.498
And my partner wants
to get his hands

637
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.325
on the patent. so he set me up.

638
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:47.722
He wants to distribute
it worldwide. as
another painkiller.

639
00:41:49.637 --> 00:41:50.420
- Prick.

640
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.337
What's his name?

641
00:41:57.863 --> 00:41:59.691
- [Bill] And those doctors
that are getting kickbacks

642
00:41:59.778 --> 00:42:01.823
from Big Pharma. they're
not just low-level

643
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.825
doctors at walk-in clinics.

644
00:42:03.912 --> 00:42:06.611
They're well-known doctors.
doctors that are in the news.

645
00:42:06.698 --> 00:42:08.743
Hell. some of them
are even surgeons.

646
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:12.138
I got some names. and I
intend to add more names

647
00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:16.098
to my growing list and expose
every damn one of them.

648
00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:18.187
- You know this asshole?

649
00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:19.885
- Hell no. I never heard of him.

650
00:42:20.886 --> 00:42:22.714
- I suspect he's heard of you.

651
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.630
- [Alan] He could be
talking about anyone.

652
00:42:25.717 --> 00:42:28.110
- Maybe. or maybe not.

653
00:42:29.285 --> 00:42:30.635
Are you keeping
everything tight?

654
00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:32.593
- [Alan] As a dog's
ass. You know me.

655
00:42:33.855 --> 00:42:35.117
- I thought I did.

656
00:42:36.075 --> 00:42:38.294
- What's that supposed to mean?

657
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:41.907
- You ever heard the saying
any publicity's good publicity?

658
00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:43.822
- Yeah.

659
00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:44.953
- It aint true.

660
00:42:46.738 --> 00:42:49.001
If we're catching bad publicity
because you're not keeping

661
00:42:49.088 --> 00:42:52.657
things shipshape. that's
gonna be a problem.

662
00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:53.527
- I'm on it.

663
00:42:55.268 --> 00:42:58.271
- You better be. There's a
lotta money riding on it.

664
00:42:58.358 --> 00:43:00.578
And get that goddam signature.

665
00:43:06.018 --> 00:43:09.978
I like you. Alan. and your
father was a good friend.

666
00:43:11.414 --> 00:43:14.679
I don't mind telling.
your father always feared

667
00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:18.857
you'd fall somewhat short
of his ambitions for you.

668
00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:22.121
[soft dramatic music]

669
00:43:26.908 --> 00:43:28.518
- [Father] You want it. Son.

670
00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:30.564
but you don't want
it bad enough.

671
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.436
So you wouldn't kill for it
because you lack the spine.

672
00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:34.437
You're not hungry.

673
00:43:36.004 --> 00:43:37.397
- [Alan] I'm doing my best.

674
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:39.094
- Your best?

675
00:43:39.181 --> 00:43:41.140
Your best. your best
is about as effective

676
00:43:41.227 --> 00:43:43.403
as a mumbled prayer on
a Monday morning. Al.

677
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.145
See. it's how you delude
yourself you're progressing

678
00:43:46.232 --> 00:43:50.192
when in fact you're scared.
scared to take the lead.

679
00:43:50.279 --> 00:43:53.239
Scared to burn your
competition. be your true self.

680
00:43:54.936 --> 00:43:58.200
- [Alan] Dad. I
don't understand.

681
00:43:58.287 --> 00:44:00.986
- [Father] Be the
machine. Son. not the cog.

682
00:44:02.074 --> 00:44:04.859
Show me you got a
pair. because right now

683
00:44:04.946 --> 00:44:06.426
I don't think you do.

684
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:09.647
[soft dramatic music]

685
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:16.218
- You could become addicted
to opioids in five days.

686
00:44:16.305 --> 00:44:18.307
Five days.

687
00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:19.613
You listening out there?

688
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:25.314
130 people die every day in
the USA overdosing on opioids.

689
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:27.490
Most of them young people.

690
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:31.625
I pray to God none of you
has to go through the hell

691
00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:33.583
of seeing your kid in a casket.

692
00:44:34.802 --> 00:44:36.804
Especially not when it
coulda been prevented.

693
00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:42.984
I dare anybody to call me right
now and tell me I'm wrong.

694
00:44:43.071 --> 00:44:44.682
Come on. worthless doctors.

695
00:44:45.857 --> 00:44:48.424
How about it.
lowlife pharma execs?

696
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:49.599
Lines are open.

697
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:54.909
No. you son of a bitches won't
call. because you're gutless.

698
00:44:54.996 --> 00:44:57.172
You're gutless.
and you're greedy.

699
00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:58.565
It's all about the
money and the house

700
00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:01.742
and the cars and
the country clubs.

701
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:03.048
It's a crime.

702

[gun firing]

704
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.584
You all need to go
to prison for murder.

705
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:20.848
This prick of a doctor
prescribed fentanyl lollipops

706
00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:23.198
for anybody with back
pain or migraines.

707
00:45:23.285 --> 00:45:27.333
even though the intended user
is late-stage cancer patients.

708
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.856
Sales reps greasing the doctors

709
00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:31.380
call that off-target marketing.

710
00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:33.252
Oh. and it's illegal.

711
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:36.864
Talk to me. caller.

712
00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:38.344
- [Caller] Hey. Bill.
thanks for your show.

713
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:39.824
You're doing great work.

714
00:45:39.911 --> 00:45:41.608
- Thanks. I try.

715
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:44.437
[dramatic music]

716
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:52.271
- [Caller] Just saying
what needs to be said.

717
00:45:52.358 --> 00:45:55.535
- Somebody's gotta say
it. Might as well be me.

718
00:45:56.884 --> 00:45:59.931
Was a free trip to
Brazil worth it. fat boy?

719
00:46:00.932 --> 00:46:01.802
Are you scared now?

720
00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:05.980
You should be.
You all should be.

721
00:46:06.067 --> 00:46:10.289
This white-collar genocide
needs to end. now.

722
00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.030
- [Caller] You know
what Orwell says.

723
00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:13.858
In a time of universal deceit--

724
00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:16.686
- Telling the truth is
a revolutionary act.

725
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:18.166
Yeah. that's a good one.

726
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:19.864
- [Caller] And the
truth is. as you said.

727
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:21.779
that it's the damn executives

728
00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:24.477
who are responsible
for so much suffering.

729
00:46:25.478 --> 00:46:27.915

[dramatic music]

733
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.061
- We've been talking
about the executives.

734
00:46:43.148 --> 00:46:45.019
and the politicians.

735
00:46:45.106 --> 00:46:46.586
But don't forget the doctors.

736
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.415
They're the ones who are
taking obscene kickbacks

737
00:46:49.502 --> 00:46:51.634
to push this poison. yeah?

738
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:54.507

[dramatic music]

742
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:26.713
They're the ones selling
out their profession

743
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.107
to vampires in suits.

744
00:47:29.194 --> 00:47:30.804
Some of them even
manufacture their own

745
00:47:30.891 --> 00:47:32.153
versions of the drugs.

746
00:47:33.372 --> 00:47:36.636
Hey. docs. I got a
question for you.

747
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:38.638
When you look in the mirror.

748
00:47:38.725 --> 00:47:42.120
do you see a reflection
looking back?

749
00:47:42.207 --> 00:47:44.949
[dramatic music]

750
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:52.478
[birds calling]

751
00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:56.308
- I have been happy to help
you. Bill. because you've

752
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:59.702
achieved more than my department
has in the last five years.

753
00:48:01.052 --> 00:48:05.404
And as much as I'm on your
side. I still got a lot to lose.

754
00:48:05.491 --> 00:48:07.449
The brass is poking around.
and they're wondering.

755
00:48:07.536 --> 00:48:10.148
how is the shooter getting
information on his target?

756
00:48:11.149 --> 00:48:12.585
Trust me. they don't know shit.

757
00:48:12.672 --> 00:48:15.327
but things have the
potential to get hot.

758
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.676
- Do you need to step away?

759
00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:18.112
- No. no. you need
to pull it back.

760
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.549
- I told you.

761
00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:22.595
I only got one serious
target right now.

762
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:25.946
- Be careful.

763
00:48:28.035 --> 00:48:30.298
Rhodes is dangerous.

764
00:48:32.692 --> 00:48:34.563
And you know that he is
juiced in with some people

765
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:35.913
with legitimate power.

766
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:38.872
Some very dark people.

767
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:43.268
- I'll look forward
to meeting him.

768
00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:45.618
[scoffing]

769
00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:49.927
- And I thought that
I was the crazy one.

770
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:50.840
Wow.

771
00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:54.322
[door closing]

772
00:48:54.409 --> 00:48:55.497
Fuck.

[dramatic music]

777
00:49:57.168 --> 00:50:00.780
- This aint no opposition
proposition debate.

778
00:50:02.129 --> 00:50:03.522
There is no debate.

779
00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:07.569
Opioids must be eliminated.

780
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:10.529
Eliminated. every
damn one of them.

781
00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:14.272
Hydrocodone.

782
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:16.535
Oxycodone.

783
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.712
Morphine. codeine.

784
00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:25.500
There's too many good
non-drug treatments.

785
00:50:26.893 --> 00:50:31.811
Ice. massage. heat. physical
therapy. acupuncture.

786
00:50:32.551 --> 00:50:34.335
God forbid. exercise.

787
00:50:34.422 --> 00:50:37.556
Too many non-addictive
pain relievers.

788
00:50:37.643 --> 00:50:41.342
Ibuprofen.
Acetaminophen. Naproxen.

789
00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:44.737
So let me be real clear on this.

790
00:50:46.217 --> 00:50:48.480
If you're one of those
people violating your oath

791
00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:51.961
and pushing this opioid
shit. you're scum.

792
00:50:53.485 --> 00:50:54.225
Scum.

793
00:50:56.749 --> 00:50:57.532
Is that harsh?

794
00:50:58.577 --> 00:50:59.665
Sure is.

795
00:51:01.449 --> 00:51:02.450
Do I care?

796
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:04.931
Hell no.

797
00:51:08.108 --> 00:51:09.762
Talk to me. caller.

798
00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:12.417
- [Alan] You know. I'm
surprised anyone can see you.

799
00:51:14.636 --> 00:51:15.942
- What do you mean?

800
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:19.163
- Sitting up there
on your high horse.

801
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.600
pontificating up
there in the clouds.

802
00:51:22.557 --> 00:51:25.908
Do you get lightheaded?

803
00:51:25.995 --> 00:51:28.085
Does it make you dizzy. Billy J?

804
00:51:28.998 --> 00:51:30.043
- You sound angry.

805
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.613
- No. no. I'm just making
an observation. Friend.

806
00:51:35.788 --> 00:51:38.617
- Well. Friend. I
call it like I see it.

807
00:51:39.487 --> 00:51:40.749
And if you don't like that.

808
00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:42.621
there's not much
I can do for you.

809
00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:45.014
- Oh you call it
as you see it. huh?

810
00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:47.626
Well tell me. what
qualifications do you have?

811
00:51:48.714 --> 00:51:49.671
Huh?

812
00:51:49.758 --> 00:51:51.020
How would you help someone

813
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:53.197
who came to you
with chronic pain?

814
00:51:54.154 --> 00:51:55.634
- Maybe you should tell me.

815
00:51:56.765 --> 00:52:01.205
What are you.
doctor. pharmacy bro?

816
00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:03.685
Or just garden-variety scum. hm?

817
00:52:03.772 --> 00:52:06.906
- No. no. no. this
isn't about me.

818
00:52:06.993 --> 00:52:09.343
You're the one who
goes on the radio

819
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.433
and starts slinging
shit about subjects

820
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.956
you know nothing about.

821
00:52:14.043 --> 00:52:16.089
- Oh I can assure
you. I know plenty.

822
00:52:16.176 --> 00:52:18.047
- Well tell me. Mr. Know It All.

823
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:21.225
someone comes to you
with chronic pain.

824
00:52:21.312 --> 00:52:24.228
and asks you for help.
what do you give them. huh?

825
00:52:24.315 --> 00:52:25.533
A gummy bear?

826
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.839
- Well. I sure
wouldn't give them

827
00:52:26.926 --> 00:52:28.362
a gummy bear laced
with fentanyl.

828
00:52:29.276 --> 00:52:30.756
- Neither would I.

829
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.236
- Than you are a doctor.

830
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:37.763
All right. Doc. you know
how addictive this shit is.

831
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:39.939
In fact. you count
on it. don't you?

832
00:52:40.026 --> 00:52:42.376
[gun firing]

833
00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:45.162
[dramatic music]

834
00:52:47.425 --> 00:52:49.383
- Bill. let me
tell you something.

835
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.647
If you look on the side of
the bottle or the package.

836
00:52:52.734 --> 00:52:56.042
it says you take one
pill every 12 hours.

837
00:52:56.129 --> 00:52:57.957
And if you follow
those directions.

838
00:52:58.044 --> 00:52:59.915
you won't have a problem.

839
00:53:00.002 --> 00:53:02.309
- When a drug starts to
affect the dopamine receptors

840
00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:04.703
in your brain. what's
written on the side

841
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.706
of a bottle aint gonna
be much help. Doc.

842
00:53:07.793 --> 00:53:10.099
- All you have to
do is follow what's

843
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.624
prescribed by
professionals. Bill.

844
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:15.279
If you don't. it's
on you. you're weak.

845
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:16.976
But what you should do. Mister.

846
00:53:17.063 --> 00:53:18.804
is you should stop
peddling lies!

847
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:21.110
[phone pinging]

848
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.331
- Exactly what lies
am I peddling. Doc?

849
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:27.029
- Lies that it's
being done on purpose.

850
00:53:27.116 --> 00:53:31.338
that it's a part of some
grand conspiracy. Bill.

851
00:53:31.425 --> 00:53:33.993
- More Americans have
died of opioid abuse

852
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.125
than were killed
in the Vietnam War.

853
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:39.128
but as long as it makes
money. nobody gives a damn.

854
00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:41.957
That's not a conspiracy.
you tell me what it is.

855
00:53:42.044 --> 00:53:44.090
- Fear mongering. fake news.

856
00:53:44.177 --> 00:53:46.527
being pushed by a liar like you.

857
00:53:46.614 --> 00:53:48.529
- If anybody knows
anything about pushing.

858
00:53:48.616 --> 00:53:49.922
I suspect it's you.

859
00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:54.318
- You better be careful
what you say to me. Bill.

860
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:57.799
I wouldn't wanna have to
sue you for defamation.

861
00:53:57.886 --> 00:54:00.367
- How can I defame you if
I don't know who you are?

862
00:54:01.673 --> 00:54:02.587
I tell you what.

863
00:54:04.023 --> 00:54:06.721
Why don't you come
down to the studio. hm?

864
00:54:06.808 --> 00:54:09.420
We can talk face to
face. mano a mano.

865
00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:13.467
I'd like to know who you are.

866
00:54:13.554 --> 00:54:15.164
I'll bet my listeners would too.

867
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:18.777
Hello?

869
00:54:23.216 --> 00:54:24.522
How illuminating.

870
00:54:25.436 --> 00:54:27.612
You have to wonder. friends.

871
00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:30.267
what kind of a man wouldn't
stand behind his words?

872
00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:33.270
Maybe somebody who's
got a lot more to lose

873
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:34.358
than he's letting on.

874
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.970
I stand by my words. Doc.

875
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.887
Why don't you stand by yours?

876
00:54:41.974 --> 00:54:45.282
Or maybe you don't wanna
go down those roads.

877
00:54:48.328 --> 00:54:49.982
- That asshole.

878
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:51.418
Thinks he knows everything.

879
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:54.726
I'll bury him.

880
00:54:56.423 --> 00:54:58.469
- You're a damn moron for
calling into that show.

881
00:54:58.556 --> 00:55:01.036
He baited you. and
you fell for it.

882
00:55:01.123 --> 00:55:02.516
- Moron?

883
00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:05.563
Oh. that is. that is rich

884
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:08.827

cast-off like you.

Insults like that?

888
00:55:17.662 --> 00:55:21.274
- You are a guest in my
life. so don't fuck with me.

889
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:23.537
sweetheart. because
I am not famous

890
00:55:23.624 --> 00:55:25.757
for my compassionate nature.

How do you like my new place?

899
00:55:59.007 --> 00:55:59.834
- Sorry.

900
00:56:02.271 --> 00:56:03.229
Can we go inside?

901
00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.362
- No. we can't.

902

- Please.

903

outta your life. remember?

904
00:56:11.977 --> 00:56:13.805
And now I'm out. for good.

905
00:56:15.067 --> 00:56:18.375
- Look. I made a mistake.

906
00:56:18.462 --> 00:56:20.072
I don't know what
I was thinking.

907
00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:22.814
- Yeah. you made a mistake.

908
00:56:22.901 --> 00:56:25.033
but I know exactly
what you were thinking.

909
00:56:26.208 --> 00:56:27.949
- I don't expect
you to forgive me.

910
00:56:28.036 --> 00:56:30.256
- Good. because I won't.

911
00:56:34.347 --> 00:56:38.569
- You know. Alan is behind
the Medicare thing. don't you?

912
00:56:38.656 --> 00:56:39.874
- Of course I know that.

913
00:56:41.485 --> 00:56:43.617
- I'd be willing to
testify for you in court.

914
00:56:47.665 --> 00:56:50.494
Can't we please
get back together?

Give me a moment.

930
00:57:54.775 --> 00:57:57.778
- Relax. sometimes people get
nervous about the reading.

931
00:57:57.865 --> 00:57:59.824
that makes the reading go up.

932
00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:01.652
Okay. here we go.

Your heart's strong.

943

- I'm glad to hear that.

944
00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:39.951
- Have I seen you before?

945
00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:42.780
- I was a patient of Dr. Mac's.

946
00:58:44.869 --> 00:58:46.871
- Unfortunately. he's
no longer with us.

947
00:58:50.265 --> 00:58:52.920
But it's. uh. your voice.

948
00:58:54.356 --> 00:58:56.533
It just seems so familiar.
Have we met somewhere?

949
00:58:58.447 --> 00:58:59.536
- No. we haven't met.

950
00:59:00.798 --> 00:59:01.538
- No?

951
00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:04.628
- Not in person.

952
00:59:09.154 --> 00:59:11.765

from the radio show.

- Winner. winner.

954
00:59:14.594 --> 00:59:15.900
- How'd you know who I was?

955
00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:19.251
- You'd be surprised
by how much I know.

956
00:59:20.948 --> 00:59:23.081
- So it's not a coincidence

957
00:59:23.168 --> 00:59:25.344
that after we talk
you're sitting here now?

958
00:59:28.956 --> 00:59:29.870
- Doesn't matter.

959
00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:32.177
- Matters to me.

960
00:59:34.527 --> 00:59:38.618

take ... to become a doctor?

- What are you.
thinking about studying?

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.057
- I'm just curious.

963
00:59:44.885 --> 00:59:47.496
- Four years of medical school
and a few years' residence.

964
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:49.629
- That's a lotta work.

965
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:53.198
That's a lotta
knowledge to be gained.

966
00:59:55.243 --> 00:59:56.723
- And?

967
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.725
- Be a shame to waste
all that effort.

968
01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:01.772
- What's that supposed to mean?

969
01:00:03.774 --> 01:00:05.863
- Do I have to spell it out?

970
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.214
- Yes. I'd like you to
spell it out for me.

971
01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:14.306
- What you do. it's important.

972
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.483
People put their trust in you.

973
01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:21.487
If a janitor quits their job.

974
01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:23.489
it's not hard to
find another janitor.

975
01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:27.928
But a surgeon?
Especially a good one.

976
01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:30.539
All those years of study.
all that knowledge.

977
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:35.196
If that was wasted for no good
reason. that'd be a shame.

978
01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:39.505

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:45.642
- Maybe it is.

01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:49.123
- I think you misheard me.

982
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.951
- Did I?

983
01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:53.911
- I asked you to spell it out
for me. not speak in riddles.

[soft dramatic music]

985
01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:01.092
- You're a good doctor. Alan.

01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:05.270
You need to stop your
extracurricular activities

987
01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:08.273
and just be a good doctor.

988
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.276
- You come into my
office to tell me

989
01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:12.712
what to do and how to live?

990
01:01:14.148 --> 01:01:15.628
- I just give advice.

991
01:01:16.803 --> 01:01:18.762
It's up to you to
take it or not.

992
01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:21.634
- You take your advice and
get the hell outta here.

994
01:01:28.815 --> 01:01:32.427

- You got a moment?

- Not really. What
are you doing here?

1025

- Ignoring each other
isn't getting us anywhere.

1026
01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.803
I need to know
where this is going.

1027
01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.024
- Well.

01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:01.419
Well. Lisa. tell me. where
would you like it to go?

- That's not funny.

I changed my life for you.
I left my husband for you.

1032
01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:11.516
I didn't ask you to
leave your husband.

1033
01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:14.823
I was pretty happy with
you being a side ride.

- A side ride. that's
all I am to you?

1035

my house and then.

more like a speed bump.

talk to me that way.

something special.

Something special?

You know. it's way
overrated. like intuition.

1042

I'll tell you
something. sweetheart.

1043
01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:42.895
Love has a shelf life. and
I feel this is expiring.

1044
01:05:44.418 --> 01:05:45.289
- Really?

1045
01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:53.079
Well before you make any hasty
decisions. consider this.

1046
01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:55.864
You talk in your sleep. asshole.

1047
01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.520
and you talk real
loud on the phone.

1048
01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:01.348
I know all about your
dirty little secrets.

1049
01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.350
including how you set up Tom.

1050
01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:05.918
- Bullshit.

1051
01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:08.007
You can't prove anything.

1052
01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:11.402
- And that precious patent
you want so desperately?

1053
01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:14.666
You'll ... never have it.

1054
01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.580
I'll see to that.

1055
01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:21.455
How's that for a speed bump?

1056
01:06:22.326 --> 01:06:25.503
[soft dramatic music]

1057
01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:49.875

- Sorry.

1059
01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.052
How did you get this cut?

1060
01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:55.968
You know. you need
to be at a hospital.

1061
01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:56.838
This thing needs stitches.

1062
01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.102
- No. no hospital.

1063
01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:01.321
They ask too many questions.

1064
01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:04.107
- Well. I'll do the best I can.

1065
01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:08.241
- Hey. you know the difference
between God and a surgeon?

1066
01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:10.200
- No. what?

1067
01:07:11.505 --> 01:07:13.507
- God doesn't think
he's a surgeon.

1068
01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:15.205
[laughing]

1069
01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:17.207
- That's more accurate
than you think.

1070
01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:20.471
Now that I patched you up.

1071
01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:23.822
what the hell
happened to your neck?

1072
01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:26.303
- I think I'm getting
under your partner's skin.

1073
01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:28.870
- Rhodes?

1074
01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:31.786
- He sent a friend to pay
me a visit last night.

1075
01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:32.700
- Christ.

1076
01:07:34.224 --> 01:07:35.355
What happened?

1077
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:38.141
- I disarmed him. tied him up.

1078
01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.794
got him to admit Rose sent him.

1079
01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:42.493
[soft dramatic music]

1080
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.407
- Jesus.

1081
01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:49.326
- Doc. I wanna tell
you something I
haven't told anybody.

1082
01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.331
I'm doing it because I
think I can trust you.

1083
01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.160
Because I think
you need my help.

1084
01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:01.033
- Sure you can trust me. Bill.

1085
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.035
Doesn't matter what it is.

1086
01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.863
- You haven't heard
what it is yet.

1087
01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:13.567
Look. you heard of
the Six-Shooter?

1088
01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.482
- Well of course. Everyone has.

1089
01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:17.180
He's all over the news.

1090
01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:18.094
What about him?

1091
01:08:23.186 --> 01:08:25.057
- You're looking at him.

1092
01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.886
[soft dramatic music]

1093
01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:30.193
- Is that supposed to
be funny or something?

1094
01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.716
Because it kinda is.

1095
01:08:31.803 --> 01:08:33.196
- Doc. what reason
would I have to tell you

1096
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.762
this if it wasn't true. hm?

1097
01:08:35.676 --> 01:08:38.201
[soft dramatic music]

1098
01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:40.986
- Yank my chain. try to
get another laugh maybe.

1099
01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:43.989
It's better than your
doctor joke. Come on.

1100
01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.557
- I'm the guy.

1101
01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:50.387
[soft dramatic music]

1102
01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:54.217
- So. Bill. I get why
you wear the masks.

1103
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:57.742
But ... why do you shoot
them all six times?

1104
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.963
- That's how many
bullets the gun holds.

1105
01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:07.621
See you.

1106
01:09:07.708 --> 01:09:10.885

- Take a look at that.

1111
01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:53.276
- [Bill] The body of a
Lutz woman. Lisa Mac?

1112
01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:54.190
- My wife.

1113
01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:56.931
- Was discovered
floating in a lake

1114
01:09:57.018 --> 01:10:00.196
in the Land O'Lakes
area Monday afternoon.

1115
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.849
an apparent drowning victim.

1116
01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:04.983
No foul play is suspected.
but the body's been taken

1117
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.203
to the county
coroner for autopsy.

1118
01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:09.422
- Yeah.

1119
01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:11.468
He hadn't taken enough from me.

1120
01:10:11.555 --> 01:10:14.210
Now he's taken the last
thing I cared anything about.

1121
01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.777
- Rhodes?

1122
01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.562
- Yeah. of course. Rhodes.

1123
01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.085
I know he's behind this.

1124
01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.174
He tried to kill you. didn't he?

1125
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:23.393
- Sure she didn't drown?

1126
01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:27.310
- She was the captain of
her college swim team. Bill.

1127
01:10:27.397 --> 01:10:29.790
No. she didn't drown.

1128
01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:30.748
Not without help.

What can I do for you. partner?

1136
01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:26.238
- Save the bullshit.

1137
01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:27.631
I'm done fighting you.

1138
01:11:28.632 --> 01:11:29.850
I'm ready to sign.

1139
01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:33.245
You can have the damn patent.

1140
01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:35.247
- This some kinda joke?

1141
01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:38.294
- Tomorrow night. my
place. I'll call you.

1142
01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:41.862
- Sure. okay. whatever you want.

1143

[soft dramatic music]

1144
01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:58.096
So ... what do you
think of me now. Dad?

1145
01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.057
- Okay. let's get to it.

1146
01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:06.757
There's good news and bad news.

1147
01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.019
Bad first.

1148
01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:13.416
You two did a sloppy job.
now Homicide's all over it.

1149
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:16.767
The good news is I'm
about to transition

1150
01:12:16.854 --> 01:12:19.509
to a whole new
level of operation.

1151
01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:21.337
No more small potatoes for me.

1152
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.427
Now Strauss is gone.

1153
01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:29.257
That means that. technically.
you boys are unemployed.

1154
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:33.479
The question remains. what is
the best way to resolve that?

1155
01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:35.960
Now you see this gun?

1156
01:12:37.701 --> 01:12:39.790
This was Strauss' favorite gun.

1157
01:12:39.877 --> 01:12:41.139
He adored this gun.

1158
01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:45.404
It's a Wyatt Earp
replica. a peacekeeper.

1159
01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:50.453
The dumb prick didn't have it
with him when he was killed.

1160
01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:54.587
If he had. he might
still be here.

1161
01:12:56.023 --> 01:12:57.895
- Why'd you bring
it here. Mr. Rhodes?

1162
01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:04.249
- For this [fires gun].

- What's all this. Tom?

1176
01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.308
- Getting all my
belongings together. man.

1177
01:14:47.395 --> 01:14:49.659
I'll be moving back
into the old house now.

1178
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:52.357
- Oh. right.

1179
01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:55.621
Sorry about Lisa. Tom.

1180
01:14:58.537 --> 01:14:59.756
- I appreciate it. buddy.

1181
01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.149
It's a hard time for all of us.

1182
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:04.848
- Surely is.

1183
01:15:07.372 --> 01:15:09.200
- That the assignment?

1184
01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:10.070
- Yeah. sure.

1185
01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:14.031
- You got a pen?

1186
01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:17.382
- Yeah.

1187
01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.384
There you go.

1188

[soft dramatic music]

1189
01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:25.521
Hope you don't mind
my asking. Tom.

1190
01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:26.957
but what changed your mind?

1191
01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:31.875
- You know I just didn't wanna
be a part of this anymore.

1192
01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:34.704
I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of losing.

1193
01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:36.662
Hell. I'm just tired.

1194
01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:40.013
Thinking about going into
a whole new line of work.

1195
01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:47.891
- That's a real good
idea. A fresh start.

1196
01:15:49.719 --> 01:15:50.589
- For both of us.

1197
01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:55.681
- Well I'll be seeing you.

1198
01:15:55.768 --> 01:15:57.030

[soft dramatic music]

1200
01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.870

are you doing here?

1201
01:16:12.437 --> 01:16:13.656
You guys know each other?

1202
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:15.658
- Yes. we do.

1203
01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:19.575
Alan. meet my new business

1204
01:16:21.707 --> 01:16:22.534
- We met.

1205

are up to. but I'm leaving.

1206
01:16:26.016 --> 01:16:27.104
- Eh. eh. eh.

1207
01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:30.673
- Are you serious?

1208
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.763
- I think you'll find
I'm a pretty serious guy.

1209
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:34.677
Right. Doc?

1210
01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:42.510
- Okay. Mr. Serious. let's cut
the dance. What do you want?

1211
01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.731
[soft dramatic music]

1212
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:50.997
- I want my daughter back.

1213
01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:53.783
- Who's your daughter?

1214
01:16:56.524 --> 01:16:57.395
- Her name was Ashley.

1215
01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:01.312
Ashley Johnson.

1216
01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:04.707
- I don't know who she is.

1217
01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:08.624
- No ... she didn't
know you either.

1218
01:17:10.843 --> 01:17:14.804
But opioids pushed by
scum like you killed her.

1219
01:17:14.891 --> 01:17:16.632
- I'm sorry for your loss.

1220
01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:19.025
but if your daughter was
an addict. that's on her.

1221
01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:19.939
- No!

1222
01:17:21.724 --> 01:17:22.550
No.

1223
01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:28.078
