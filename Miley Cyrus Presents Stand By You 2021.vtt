-Freedom is a basic human right.

Well. right now for some of us.

1178
01:06:14.432 --> 01:06:16.643
it's more of a privilege
than a luxury.

1179
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.854
My dad always says that
a problem clearly defined

1180
01:06:19.896 --> 01:06:21.231
is half solved.

1181
01:06:21.272 --> 01:06:23.316
But we know the issues
we're faced with.

1182
01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.860
But now we have to look them
fearlessly in the eye.

1183
01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:30.281
and confront generations
of misunderstanding and hatred.

1184
01:06:30.323 --> 01:06:33.118
We can't end at awareness.
We can't talk about it.

1185
01:06:33.159 --> 01:06:34.703
We got to be about it.

1186
01:06:34.744 --> 01:06:38.998
We gotta combat these issues
with education. compassion.

1187
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.876
brazenness. and above all else.

1188
01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:43.086
love!

1189
01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:45.338
Love is always the answer.

1190
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.382
Whenever you're in doubt
about yourself.

1191
01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:49.759
your own power. your identity.
your sexuality.

1192
01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:52.178
whatever the challenge
you're facing may be.

1193
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.722
love is never wrong.

1194
01:06:53.763 --> 01:06:55.974
As Mama Ru says.
"If you can't love yourself.

1195
01:06:56.016 --> 01:06:57.726
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1196
01:06:57.767 --> 01:06:59.519
Can I get an amen!"

1197
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:03.982

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:09.863
