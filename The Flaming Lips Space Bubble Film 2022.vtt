00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:15.273
So let's go back to the year
2000 and we as the Flaming Lips.

10
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.779
we set the agenda.

11
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:25.575

to do is start to make this

12
00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:30.580
absurd. surreal.
sci-fi Christmas movie.

13
00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.125
It ends up being
called 'Christmas on Mars.'

14
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:42.217
I think we started to make
the movie because Steven and I

15
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.554
wanted to make the
soundtrack to a movie.

16
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:47.556
so we just made up a movie
that it was going to be about.

17
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:56.064
At the very beginning of
this conceptualizing about what

18
00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:03.530
scenes we were going to
shoot. in the very beginning.

19
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.824
I had this...

20
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.325
the character that I
play in the movie.

21
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.912
I'm this alien superbeing...

22
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.380
and I'm arriving on-- it's not

23
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.426
really Mars. but I
come onto the scene.

24
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:28.221

shaped like a bubble.

We start to look
for a big. round.

27
00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:00.295
clear. probably
inflatable bubble.

28
00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:06.760
It was around
2003 or four--

29
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.304
you know. late
2003/early 2004--

30
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.222
when Wayne came
to me and wanted

31
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.726
me to help him find a
bubble to purchase. and

32
00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.020
I kinda of was like. "Okay."

33
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.941
Back then. the Internet
wasn't what it is today.

34
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:26.946
but you could still do a search
and find lots of great stuff.

35
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:33.036
But as much as we
looked and searched.

36
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:38.792
at the time. we
couldn't find anything.

37
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.215
And I kept thinking about this
scene that I wanted to shoot.

38
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:50.512
so we ended up just doing the
scene using computer animation.

39
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:09.364
We didn't end up needing the
space bubble to make the movie.

40
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:14.953
but lo and behold about a
year and a half later...

41
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.165
Wayne calls me up and
says. "I found the bubble."

42
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.001
It was this place in Italy.
and I started talking to him.

43
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:24.587
It was this guy named Charles.
and it turns out he actually

44
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.841
lived in Oklahoma at one point.
and he was the guy who owned

45
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:32.345
this plastic company that
made these "water balls."

46
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.180
which is what they called them.

47
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.725
The idea was that you're
supposed to get in the ball.

48
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:41.020
get in a swimming
pool. and walk on water.

49
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.815
So the space bubble.
just one space bubble.

50
00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:48.820
shows up and it just happens
to be a few days before we are

51
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:56.411
going out to play the
big Coachella festival.

52
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.205
I don't remember
the time exactly.

53
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:04.085
but I do remember showing up for
work on a suburban Edmond Street

54
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.046
in a suburb of Oklahoma City.

55
00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.840
I remember Wayne came
over and we blew it up.

56
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.926
He brought a leaf blower and we
blew it up in our front yard.

57
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.763
and he walked down the street
with all the neighbors looking

58
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:15.805
out.

59
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.140
I think they always
knew we were weird.

60
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.477
but after that
they knew for sure.

61
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.103
We didn't know what
was going to happen.

62
00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.856
We didn't know if we were going
to walk on one little rock and

63
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.274
the whole thing would pop.

64
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.401
We had no idea.

65
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:33.114
You have to keep in mind this
is a giant American festival.

66
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.409
and they've got lots of
stagehands and lots of

67
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:41.164
insurance. and they're very
worried about everything going

68
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.875
according to plan.

69
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:48.755
And we as the Flaming Lips.
we're pretty used to people

70
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.132
saying. "No. you can't do that."

71
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:56.137
So we collectively decided
that we wouldn't tell anybody.

72
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.432
we wouldn't say
anything about it.

73
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:04.020
And we're about to
start to do our first song.

74
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.440
and there's a usual panic
and a lot of calamity at these

75
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.234
festivals.

76
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.362
It's a lot of people setting
up. and nobody really seems to

77
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:16.574
notice. and I just get in the
space bubble and we blow it up.

78
00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.745
and before you know it the band
goes into the first song and I

79
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.998
just jump out on
top of the crowd.

80
00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:27.168
Sort of to our
relief and surprise.

81
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.211
nobody stops me.

82
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.712
That is awesome!

83
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.966
No. no. no!

84
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.260
Hey Michael. we're going!

85
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.265
At the time. it
was such an exhilarating.

86
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:45.520
embarrassing. adrenaline-filled
moment because you just don't

87
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.107
know what's going to happen.

88
00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.900
You don't know if the stagehands
are going to stop you.

89
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.319
if they're going to be mad
and stop the whole show.

90
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.031
or if the audience is going
to grab it and tear it apart.

91
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:02.036
It's all just so
nerve-wracking. so you just go.

92
00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:06.374
I remember a big
issue at Coachella was.

93
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:11.337
once he rolled into the crowd.
would he be able to get back?

94
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.090
My biggest worry was Wayne
was going to be out there in the

95
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.009
middle of the audience and
someone was going to hit it with

96
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.594
a cigarette.

97
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.262
And in my head.
it's like a balloon.

98
00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.931
The air just goes. it collapses.
and Wayne just sinks into the

99
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.310
audience.

100
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.315
And I was holding a Bowie knife.
and I had this knife in my hand

101
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.947
thinking I was going to have to
jump into the audience and cut

102
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.950
Wayne out of this
deflated bubble.

103
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.954
Part of me thought. "It
might just really work.

104
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.081
and it might be
utterly fantastic." and

105
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.877
so you take that chance.

106
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:55.882
I get in it. and I do my best
to walk on top of the audience.

107
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.722
but I can't really
walk on top of them.

108
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.267
I take a step or
two and fall over.

109
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.062
and I get back up as best I can.

110
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:14.067
But when I'm walking. I do try
to look relaxed and elegant as

111
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.363
though I do this all the time.
even though it was the very

112
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.281
first time.

113
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.785
It almost immediately
became this iconic image.

114
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.621
They take these fantastical
things that you make up when

115
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.666
you're just sitting around
with your friends and saying.

116
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.376
"Wouldn't it be
funny if we did this?"

117
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.253

who actually go and do it.

118
00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:38.091
There was a cover
story in Newsweek.

Donald Rumsfeld
was on the cover.

120
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.554
but there was something
about music festivals.

121
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:46.015
And inside of Newsweek
there was a two-page spread.

122
00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:51.020
and the photo was of Wayne on
the audience at Coachella in his

123
00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.147
bubble.

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:58.152
It has just started to be
embraced and it started to

125
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.739
become a thing that we would do.

126
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:06.285
It started to become a thing
that the audience expected us to

127
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.121
do.

128

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.455
I did this little drawing
that was meant to be a little

wonder if he's actually thinking

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:50.087
but there's no way
we could do that.

170
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.591
I would be crazy if I said we
weren't all worried in our own

171
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.344
ways and wondering what was
going on or how it was going to

172
00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.764
be safe. but at the same time
it's with a group of people that

173
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.808
you put your safety in
their hands all the time.

174
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.144
We're used to this. we take care
of each other on the road all

175
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.521
the time. so if anybody was
going to do it or if I was going

176
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.648
to trust anybody to
do it. it would be us.

177
00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.693
And that was pretty
early. getting together.

178
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:17.698
I missed being able to be
around our gang and our friends

179
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.118
and get to do stuff and play.

180
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.704
So even though it was difficult.
I was excited that we were going

181
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.414
to get to do something.

182
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:30.419
I thought "Oh shit. he's
really going to do that."

183
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:34.882
I was more scared of how much
work this was going to be and

184
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.218
what are other people
going to think of it?

185
00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.053
Are they going to think
we're being reckless.

186
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:44.058
or not care about
the serious situation?

187
00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:49.980
But I knew that we did care. and
we were just as worried if not

188
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.982
more worried than
everybody else.

189
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:53.651
He would find a
way to do it safely.

190
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.153
but it sounded pretty hard.

191
00:19:56.153 --> 00:20:00.366
At the beginning of the first
couple of weeks of the lockdown.

192
00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.661
all the late-night talk shows
were scrambling a little bit to

193
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.872
figure out what they were
going to do about having musical

194
00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.874
guests.

195
00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:12.169
And the Stephen
Colbert show talent buyer.

196
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:17.174
he was hinting around about
maybe we could do one of these

197
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:22.430

space bubbles like he'd seen in

198
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.348
my Instagram.

199
00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.934
I was hinting
around at that too.

200
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:29.728
wondering. "Hey do you
think that we could do this?"

201
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:34.692
We start to set out
to do this very first.

202
00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.486
this very limited.
this very cautious.

203
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:42.491
this very stripped down
at home concert song.

204
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:51.542
So. we asked everybody in our
family and all of our friends

205
00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:55.671
that we think would be up to
this to come down and help us.

206
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.673
We even asked the
mayor of Oklahoma City.

207
00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:01.010
My first thought is: nobody is
doing anything at this point.

208
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.386
Nobody is gathering.

209
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.639

were going to be on TV.

again because we hadn't gotten

214
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.694
together as a band.

215
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:22.072
When the idea for the
Colbert thing first came up.

216
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:27.077
I was certainly nervous.

217
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:31.415
Not against the
idea. just nervous.

218
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:36.337
My wife has got some
pretty severe asthma.

219
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.589

early on into the pandemic.

220
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.466
It was probably only two months
in and there was so much we

221
00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.634
didn't know.

222
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.928
Again. I knew it
was going to be cool.

It's kind of hard to

231
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.876
But I took that role seriously.

232

That was the first night of
performing with people in the

That was really weird.

234
00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:25.678
I felt a disconnect there.
You know?

235
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:30.683
I usually don't seek out
the validation on Instagram or

236
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.062
whatever. but I
kind of needed it.

237
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:39.108
Everybody sees it on TV. and
we got the feeling whether you

238
00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.943
loved it or
whether you hated it.

everybody sort of
reacted like. well.

this is already a concert.

241
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:49.076
And I can understand where they
would think that because most of

242
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:54.081
the at home concerts would
literally be one or two people

243
00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:58.669
sitting on the couch in their
living room where this was a

244
00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:00.879
whole group and
we're on a stage.

245
00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:03.507
And we have people though.
everybody's in the space bubble.

we have an

So. I think it went out into the
world as the Flaming Lips are

248
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.810
putting on concerts
inside these bubbles.

249
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.398
And even though we knew it
was really just one song.

250
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:22.359
It was very quick and
haphazard or whatever.

251
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:27.364
we started to get maybe an idea
that as people were getting more

weary of the pandemic and there
seemed to be more and more of a

desire for someone to figure
out how can we do concerts?

254
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:45.299
And everybody was thinking. we'd
already figured out this way to

255
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.052
do concerts. even though we
hadn't really figured it out.

And it took a while to kind

The healthcare system
in the United States.

269
00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:09.062
the way it is. hospitals
can't just have all that gear.

270
00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:13.650
all that equipment. just in
stock and storage because of the

271
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.944
cost.

272
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:19.281
So all of a sudden. we're used
to having maybe a few patients a

273
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:22.200
month on the vent and then the

Everybody was trying to
scramble to get equipment.

278
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:36.465
Some good friends of ours have
a tech company and they were

279
00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:40.969
making ventilators from sourced
parts that you could get here

280

ventilators from China.

281
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:47.559
no one could get them and there
was a big shortage up in New

282

283
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.397
They also made. I don't
know if it ever got into being

284
00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:55.609
manufactured. but they made a
great digital soap dispenser

285
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:58.654

the 20 seconds.

Of course. they put
some glitter in it.

292
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:25.055
You have to remember Trump is

294

going to do anything to help you

Yeah.

308
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:11.810
I mean. it was weeks of dealing
with it and getting out there

309
00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:18.942
early and trying to get in line
and it was going to be too long.

310
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:22.946
or we weren't going to
be able to get a voucher.

311
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:28.326
You know. when I first heard
that these lines were forming.

312
00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:32.039
it's just something that I
had to see for myself because

313
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:37.044
honestly. I haven't seen
anything like that outside of a

314
00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:40.630
history book and seeing
the lines during the great

315
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.425
depression of people
waiting for food and relief.

316
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.886
I made a little video of me
walking through this line and it

317
00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:48.555
took a good five to 10 minutes
for me just to walk from one end

318
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:50.182
of the line to the other.

319
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:55.187
We knew people that were at the
ground zero of the violence and

320
00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:02.194
the protests in the
Black Lives Matter movement.

321
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:04.321
So we were very
inspired by them.

322
00:31:04.321 --> 00:31:07.741
I didn't feel like not
doing anything for sure.

323
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:09.993
I felt motivated
to do something.

324
00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:12.370
When you are a creator of
something in a community.

325
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.998
I feel like you become extra
invested in that community.

326
00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:17.459
right?

327
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:20.337
Because if you're successful
in creating that thing or you

328
00:31:20.337 --> 00:31:22.339
choose some kind of
definition of success.

329
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:24.466
it's because the
community has come behind you.

330
00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:27.052
That's how I feel
about this store.

331
00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:30.639

332

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.812

then the protests following the

coming here and all of those

335
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:45.612
things. I mean. we
couldn't just say.

336
00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:48.365
"Well. I'm not going
to do anything now.

337
00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:51.034
because this is too much."

338
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:54.287
The protest happened
outside of our shop.

339
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:57.249
right here on
Archer and Greenwood.

340
00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:59.167
There were a lot of sneaker
stores that were getting broken

341
00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:01.795
into all over the country.

342
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:06.466
And when word came out that
Trump was going to come here.

343
00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.385
I remember that was one
of my biggest fears was.

344
00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:12.264
"Oh my gosh. if there's
violence. if there's chaos.

345
00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:13.765
something is going to
happen to this store.

346
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.392
We're right here on Greenwood.

347
00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:20.147
We are a target. because of what
we represent in terms of Black

348
00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:22.274
success. Black wealth."

349
00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:26.903
I made the decision though
that I wasn't going to run away.

350
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:30.240
I wasn't going to board my
windows like some businesses

351
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.450
were. I was going to stand here.

352
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.913
I was going to open my doors
and I was going to operate.

353
00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:40.792
I don't think we ever thought
we were the only ones doing

354
00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.419
something like this.

355
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.629
I think we thought any
minute. there would be 10.

356
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.632
20 other bands doing
something in their own way.

357
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:51.970
To me. the real panic is when
Wayne came over and was talking

358
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.848
to me about it and
said. "Let's do this."

359
00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:56.641
And then I agree.

360
00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:59.186
That's when the panic kicks in.

361
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:05.192
Well. we end up making the
decision to order the space

362
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:07.110
bubbles.

363
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.988
We're looking ahead a bit in
time thinking about promoters

364
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:13.742
and thinking
about these concerts.

365
00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:16.119
these venues. and even the
people that work at the venues

366
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:19.998
and our own Flaming Lips
road crew and thinking.

367
00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.708
well. what can we do?

368
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:25.921
Is there a way that we can make
some kind of concerts happen and

369
00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:28.089
they can get back to work.
and they can make some money?

370
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.759
And we can all
contribute to helping this.

371
00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:35.680
We had to make kind of a leap
of faith in ourselves to make

372
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.643
that purchase of a
hundred bubbles.

373
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:41.728
Yeah.

374
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:46.691
Yeah. I guess when I found out
that Wayne was actually buying a

375
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:51.238
hundred space bubbles.
it made it all real. you know?

376
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:53.657
It seemed like an
idea for a long time.

377
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.368
It's cool to talk about
doing a concert that way.

378

you don't think about or that

get ready for when
albums come out.

388
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.885
So. we started to get asked
if we can do shows and so we do

389
00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:05.890
this great NPR show. the Tiny
Desk show and we're actually in

390
00:37:06.683 --> 00:37:09.394
the space bubbles. but we're
just in our studio and this is

391
00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:12.939
starting to show us how we can
really play instruments and how

392
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:15.108
we can really set up things.
because we're doing multiple

393
00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:16.609
songs now.

394
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:18.987
It's not just one

little speech here real quick.

396

You've got to get
out of the frame. sorry.

397
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.286
Now we're starting
to do multiple songs.

398
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.998
And I think in a way. all that
is coming as a little bit of

399
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:34.043
relief. because it is so
difficult to do just a normal

400
00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:39.048
concert without being in space
bubbles and the audience not

401
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:42.093
being in space bubbles.

402
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.971
So this is starting to give us
a little bit of hint of like.

403
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.849
could we actually do.
when we say a concert.

404
00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:52.312
could we actually do
90 to 100 minute sets?

405
00:37:52.312 --> 00:37:54.647
Is any of that possible?

406
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:59.444
So being able to set up in our
studio and to play and sing and

407
00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:03.281
have all those mechanisms
kind of go where if you mess up.

you can try it again.

"Well. how long can you stay in
one of these before it runs out

421

And I think all those are

great questions.

425
00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:09.889
We were thinking it
could be up to three people.

426
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:14.143
And just how long could three
people be in one of these space

it's going to run out of air.

It's just short of two hours.

would be a 90 minute set.

500
00:50:32.613 --> 00:50:34.949
It all goes great. and we
put it out into the world.

501
00:50:34.949 --> 00:50:39.954
and the video looks
and sounds spectacular.

502
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:45.709
I think there's a part of
everybody knows it's a video.

503
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.544
but then it goes
out into the world.

504
00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:51.382
and people. once again.
think it's an actual concert.

505
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:55.803
♪"There Should Be Unicorns"
by The Flaming Lips♪

506
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:07.564
♪"Segue Music Pre the
Terror" by The Flaming Lips♪

507
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.191
Once
inside the space bubble.

508
00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:11.443
you can remove your mask.

509
00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:13.112
But please remember--

510
00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:17.908
We've got all this momentum and
we're feeling confident about

511
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:22.121
it. but we quickly
approach this moment of truth.

512
00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:26.625
We'll announce a show. and we'll
have to put tickets on sale.

513
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:30.629
And though up until then. it
would feel like there's a lot of

514
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:32.631
excitement about
what we're doing.

515
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:36.969
and there's literally no
other shows happening.

516
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:38.804
And so part of you
feels like. "Well.

517
00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:40.556
everybody will
want to come to this."

518
00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:41.974
but you really don't know.

519
00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:46.603
And it really was a
stressful moment.

520
00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:51.608
We put the first show on sale.
and it seems to sell out in

521
00:51:52.318 --> 00:51:54.611
about 30 seconds.

522
00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:57.156
It sells out so quickly that we
think there's something has gone

523
00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:59.575
wrong with the system.

524
00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:01.869
And so. we're
panicking like. oh.

525
00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:03.495
something is messed up.

526
00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:06.832
Part of us is relieved.
we think it's sold out.

527
00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:09.084
But part of us is confused
because we don't know it's if

528
00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:11.045
right or not.

529
00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:14.923
But after 10 or 20
minutes. we realize.

530
00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:18.385
"Oh. this concert is sold out."

531
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:23.057
So. we regroup about midday
and we decide that we'll add a

532
00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:28.062
second show.
So bam. second show is added.

533
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:33.150
And that one sells out
in about 45 seconds.

534
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.195
And so the whole thing
seems like this is...

535
00:52:36.195 --> 00:52:37.446
It's spectacular.

536
00:52:37.446 --> 00:52:40.115
It seems like there's
a big demand for this.

537
00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:43.994
But then as the
following weeks go.

538
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:47.539
I think for the first time
since the pandemic started.

539
00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:51.377
the numbers start to
get pretty alarming.

540
00:52:51.377 --> 00:52:53.045
Yeah.

541
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:55.464
We had more people die in
Oklahoma City in the two weeks

542
00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:58.050
after Thanksgiving
than died in March.

543
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.261
April. May. June combined.

544
00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:04.139
And actually. I believe that was
right leading into the original

545
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.768
dates for the
space bubble concert.

546
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:11.522
I think in our minds it
was always a little bit like.

547
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.857
well. we're going
to announce them.

548
00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:16.402
And of course. in these times I
think the audience and everybody

549
00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:20.614
would understand if we needed to
change the dates or postpone it.

550
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:24.576
So a couple of weeks goes by.
and we decide then that we'll

551
00:53:24.576 --> 00:53:28.080
postpone those shows.

552
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.625
And we didn't really know
when would be a good time.

553
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:36.630
but we hinted around let's
wait till later in the new year.

554
00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:41.427
So we decide
those are postponed.

555
00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:44.972
and we look into the future
and somehow try to predict that

556
00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:48.934
whatever the COVID numbers are
after Thanksgiving and after

557
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:53.939
Christmas. maybe two weeks
or so after the new year.

558
00:53:56.275 --> 00:54:01.280
maybe would be a safe time to
do these first two space bubble

559
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.824
shows.

560
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:06.702
So we announced that
they're going to be in 2021.

561
00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:08.704
and we'll do them on January...

562
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:10.706
I think it's
January 10th and 11th.

563
00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:12.040
The 22nd.

564
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.250
Oh. there you go.

565
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:17.838
So we announced that the shows
are going to be in the new year.

566
00:54:17.838 --> 00:54:19.590
in 2021.

567
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:24.386
And we announced that it's going
to be January 21st and 22nd.

568
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:25.971
22nd and 23rd.

569
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:27.389
We do this all the time.

570
00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:32.394
So no. so it's
January 22nd and 23rd.

571
00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.605
There you go.

572
00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:39.610
And I think Scott was smart for
picking the days of January 22nd

573
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:43.113
and the 23rd of 2021.

574
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:46.450
bubble inflating]

575
00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:52.956
Every year we bring Santa into
the hospital for kids to visit.

576
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:57.169
We try to normalize the hospital
experience as much as we can.

577
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:59.838
And so I contacted
Wayne and I said.

578
00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:01.840
"I have this crazy idea.

579
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.302
How about we put
Santa in a space bubble?"

580
00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:07.804
And he was all over it quickly.

581
00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:11.266
The space bubble allowed us to
be able to bring Santa to our

582
00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:14.102
patients. to our
families. and to our staff.

583
00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:16.647
That made it just such
a memorable experience.

584
00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:18.607
Yeah.

585
00:55:18.607 --> 00:55:23.612
So I got my positive COVID
test back on Christmas Day.

586
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:28.283
And then we had a quarantine
from Christmas Day until New

587
00:55:28.283 --> 00:55:30.619
Year's Day.
And it sucked. it was horrible.

588
00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:35.624
I was as sick as I'd been
since I was a little kid.

589
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:39.127
I had a terrible fever and was
waking up in the middle of the

590
00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:40.587
night. sweating.

591
00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:43.131
We got COVID because we were
around one person for a day that

592
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:48.136
had it. and yeah.
And it was no fun. for sure.

593
00:55:48.554 --> 00:55:53.433
Well. the phone call
was the scariest part.

594
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.727
It was I'm sorry to inform you
that you've tested positive.

595
00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:58.981
You're like...

596
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:00.899
It was freaky.

597
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:09.116
Anyway. after the phone
call. then it's just.

598
00:56:09.116 --> 00:56:10.409
I got to keep Wayne safe.

599
00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:12.286
I've got to keep Bloom safe.

600
00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:14.705
I've got to keep my mom safe.

601
00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:17.791
So we figured out all the ways
to run a household with the mom

602
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.877
being separated from the family.

603
00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.129
And it was around Christmas.

604
00:56:22.129 --> 00:56:25.090
That wasn't fun.

605
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:30.095
♪"She Don't Use Jelly"

606
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:38.205
Oh. my God!

607
00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:40.666
Hold on!

608
00:57:43.001 --> 00:57:45.045
I made it!

609
00:58:56.575 --> 00:58:58.410
At the end
of the concert everyone will.

610
00:58:58.410 --> 00:58:59.995
while still inside
the space bubble.

611
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:02.247
roll their space
bubble to the exit door.

612
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:04.791
Once outside the venue. you can
unzip your space bubble and get

613
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:06.251
out.

614
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:11.256
So we are still very concerned
about what the audience will do

615
00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:19.222
in this immediate. these
immediate moments after we're

616
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.141
done playing the show.

617
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:26.021
Because we don't really want
them to just unzip the bubble.

618
00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:30.066
letting out all of this
potentially COVID contaminated

619
00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:34.529
air into a room. and
everybody just jump out in it.

620
00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:39.367
So we decide that they will exit
the venue while they're still

621
00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:43.872
inside their space bubble.

622
00:59:43.872 --> 00:59:46.041
And we think at first that
they're just going to go out the

623
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:50.879
front door like they came in.
but the front doors are too

624
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.923
small.

625
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:56.426
So we end up using the doors
in the back of The Criterion.

626
00:59:56.426 --> 01:00:01.431
the big equipment. loading
and equipment in and out doors.

627
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:06.937
And these doors just happen. by
a strange coincidence which I

628
01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:11.691
didn't even remember. these
doors just happened to open up

629
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:15.612
onto Flaming Lips Alley.

630
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:20.617
So in 2007. this
became Flaming Lips Alley.

631
01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:24.996
But 13 years ago. we
actually started a school.

632
01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:28.083
the Academy of Contemporary
Music with The University of

633
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.710
Central Oklahoma. just
down a block this way.

634
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:35.215
Can't wait to see if
some big guys would come help us

635
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:38.301
straighten it out.

636
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:43.306
But right now. 400 yards away
from here on Flaming Lips Alley

637
01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.935
is the venue where we did
all the space bubble shows.

638
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:49.855
The Criterion.

639
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.028
All the way
down as far as you can.

640
01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:59.823
you already got
your mask on for me. okay?

641
01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.283
You're going to get out. and
you're going to put your blue

speaker in that box.

643
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:07.664
There should be a trash
down there for you okay?

644
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.127
Okay.

645
01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.136
All right.

646
01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:22.429
I'm going to take my
mask off for this.

647
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:23.889
All right.

648
01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:28.018
I'm mixing the sanitizing juice.
fog juice every night that we

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.908
making sure that we reload
everything the proper way.

653
01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.285
Let's see. we've done
seven of these now.

654
01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:48.538
and I've tested
negative seven times in a row.

655
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.792
So if anybody was going to get.
it it'd probably be me who was

656
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.378
in contact with every single
one of these bubbles and every

657
01:01:55.378 --> 01:02:00.383
single person. but in testament
to how safe this actually is.

658
01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:03.553
I'm good. Yeah.

659
01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.388
So right now. what
we're sitting in here.

660
01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:09.142
each bubble weighs 23 pounds.

661
01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:12.646
So with over 100 bubbles. we
have a metric ton of bubble-age

getting ready. nice and safe.
for everybody the next day.

666
01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.658

back to clean just the outside

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:28.244
of them. we came up with this.
Did some quick math here.

668
01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.413
I'll let you see what me and my
friend Pete Winslow came up with

669
01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.248
here.

670
01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:43.093
The area of a sphere is equal
to four times pie times radius

671
01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:46.721
squared.

672
01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.057
So these are six and
a half foot bubbles.

673
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:53.186
which comes out to be 126
square feet per bubble.

674
01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.063
Keep that in mind whenever
you come to the bubble shows.

675
01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.650
that you have 126 square
feet inside of each bubble.

676
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.987
It's good size.

677
01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:06.992
Times 100 is 12.600 square feet.

678
01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.413
And if you think about it. when
you're cleaning out the outside.

679
01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:16.418
if you have a one foot
swath. wax on wax off.

680
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.672
to clean the entire outside of
every bubble is a two mile wipe

681
01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.008
down.

682
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:25.719
So from your house to probably
the closest McDonald's is the

683
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:29.347
distance it takes to wipe down
all the bubbles for the show and

684
01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.391
get them ready and nice and
clean for you for the next night

685
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:32.851
when you come in.

686
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.602
It's deadly serious. but that
doesn't mean we still can't have

687
01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.438
fun while we're doing it.

688
01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:45.071
My family. we lost a couple of
people around the end of last

689
01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.740
year because of COVID.

690
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.492
This was my dad's
brother and his mother.

691
01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.203
We lost both of them
within two weeks of each other.

692
01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:53.413
We're all getting tested.

693
01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.041
We're all getting
vaccinated at this point.

694
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.418
Yeah. we're doing the
best we can to make it safe.

695
01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:01.880
And I feel a lot
safer as time went on.

696
01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.885
So there's still these
details that you can't quite...

697
01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.222
When you're
thinking in the abstract.

698
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.475
you can't quite figure out
what they're going to be.

699
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:17.062
So we decide that
the line for the...

700
01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:21.858
we're going to have the audience
line up outside in the socially

701
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.985
distant rows.

702
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:28.740
And once we know that
everybody is in line.

703
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:33.745
Zach would go out. and he would
escort each row into the venue.

704
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:37.373
into their space bubbles. get
one row in and then go get the

705
01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.459
next one.

706
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:44.464
And we've done some work with
radio and headphones before.

707
01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:49.427
so we've worked out that the
sound inside the space bubbles

708
01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:52.305
is this little
speaker that you wear.

709
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.682
It enhances the sound that's on
the outside and it makes it so

710
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:56.768
you can hear the
high end on the inside.

711
01:04:56.768 --> 01:05:00.438
We have a radio
transmitter on the stage.

712
01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:05.110
which is sending a stereo signal
out to all these portable FM

713
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.737
speaker systems
that you're carrying.

714
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.323
putting around your neck.
inside the space bubble.

715
01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.201
Once inside the space
bubble. you will see and hear

716
01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:16.955
your in bubble high frequency
supplement speaker.

717
01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:20.500
The blue dots should
face out like this.

718
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.088
There is a battery operated fan
that is yours to use and keep.

719
01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.757
There is a bottle of water with
the Flaming Lips space bubble

720
01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.427
commemorative concert
logo insignia on it.

721
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:35.056
There's a towel to wipe down
the condensation buildup on the

722
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.892
inside of your space bubble.

723
01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:42.689
There is a sign to show the
attendance that you have to pee.

724
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:45.275
and they will assist you getting
out and getting back in your

725
01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.277
space bubble.

726
01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:50.613
The other side of the
sign says it's hot in here.

727
01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.116
Show this to the attendant and
they will refresh your space

728
01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:56.911
bubble with new cool air.

♪drumming♪

731
01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:43.124
So the shows. they go. they
go better than we would've ever

732
01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.126
hoped that they could go.

733
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:49.380
They just go
utterly spectacular.

734
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.385
And there's even a slightly
impromptu wedding proposal.

735
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.723
which is something
that The Flaming Lips do.

736
01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.100
We don't do it at every show.
but we do wedding proposals

737
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.269
quite often.
We're used to doing them.

738
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:06.022
We've never done one
in the space bubble.

739
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:11.027
Erin and Jesse are in
bubble number three

740
01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:15.907
in the ninth row there.

741
01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:21.913
He gets down on one knee. and
from the way it looks on the

742
01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:27.919
video screen. she is at
first kind of confused.

743
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.008
and despite not being able to
hear very well there's leaf

744
01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:37.679
blowers and no one can
really tell what's going on.

745
01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:41.182
it seems to go pretty good.

746
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:45.770
And at the very end of it...

747
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.313
She says. "Yes."

748
01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:50.775
And there's a great
"Yeah. we did it."

749
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.239
He was more fascinated with
the confetti that was out in the

750
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.282
crowd.

751
01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.950
It was just get one
piece of confetti.

752
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.451
he was good.

753
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.537
He'd just gather
on the whole time.

754
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.123
Do people think Wayne's crazy?

755
01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.541
I'm sure they do.

756
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:08.793
Yeah. but he is so not...

757
01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.462
So safe.
So cautious.

758
01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:12.922
Doesn't take drugs.

759
01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.258
Doesn't...

760
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.885
any mind-altering substance.

761
01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:22.682
Just wants to be in control.
wants everybody to be safe.

762
01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:24.934
And everybody who
knows him knows that.

763
01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.896
So the concert goes good. but
we're still very concerned as

764
01:08:28.896 --> 01:08:33.901
the next weeks go.

765
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.365
Are we going to find out in
two or three weeks that say 10

766
01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:43.953
people that were at the
shows now have tested positive.

767
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.040
And this has turned
out to be a bad idea.

768
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.791
By the time
January rolled around.

769
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.044
the numbers were actually
starting to stabilize and come

770
01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:52.837
down a little bit.

771
01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.089
Half of you is very concerned
that you've done this horrible

772
01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.050
thing and that we should stop.

773
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.052
And half of you is moving
forward at the same time.

774
01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:04.057
So we're in this two mindsets
overtaking you at the same time.

775
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:09.270
Maybe that was part of the
stress was knowing a lot of

776
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.522
people have traveled
a long ways for this.

777
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:15.860
A lot of people have paid a lot
of money and that weighs heavily

778
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.862
on me too.

779
01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:20.615
Well. I think that the
very first show is definitely

780
01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.910
frightening because you don't
know how the crowd is going to

781
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:27.121
move and react to instruction.

782
01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:32.126
And after nights
would progress.

783
01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:35.880
zippers on bubbles are breaking.

784
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.091
And so I'm talking to Zac about
those kinds of things every

785
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.218
night.

786
01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:42.887
And he trying to gauge how
stressed or worried he is and

787
01:09:42.887 --> 01:09:46.557
that'll inform how
worried I should be.

788
01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:53.272
In a dystopian
sense of normalcy.

789
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:58.277
something that was safe for
people who like our music and

790
01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:05.451
who are fans of ours to come
and actually do something...

791
01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:12.750
Without knowing what has
happened at the January shows.

792
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.963
we decide to announce the shows
and we put the shows up for

793
01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.840
sale.

794
01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.427
We do two shows at one time. the
March 12th and 13th shows. bam!

795
01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:27.432
Those shows sell out in
a matter of a minute.

796
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:31.102
And we quickly add
two more shows to that.

797
01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.228
So we add-- bam!

798
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.772
We add the-- bam!

799
01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:39.777
We add the 11th and
the 14th and those...

800
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:42.905
maybe that's too many
"bams" at this point.

801
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.991
We are starting to
think ahead a little bit.

802
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:48.578
So we go ahead and put on the
very next weekend shows and we

803
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:53.583
start with March 19th
and the 20th and-- bam!

804
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:57.670
And those sell out.

805
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.380
And. and without
giving it too much thought.

806
01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.591
we had a show for
that Sunday. and-- bam!

807
01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.885
It sells out as well.

♪"All We Have Is Now"
by The Flaming Lips♪

809
01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:01.544
I think the reason I'm a
musician or an artist at all is

810
01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:03.921
because I can't really stay
focused on the same thing for

811
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.506
too long.

812
01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.133
So if it gets too
comfortable. it sucks anyway.

813
01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.468
So for us. it was
a great challenge.

814
01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.721
At first it was
sort of like. oh man.

815
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.848
okay. we're not going to
be able to hear each other.

816
01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:15.308
or are the drums
going to sound like shit?

817
01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:18.269
Like all these sorts of things
and these these questions.

818
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:21.897
Doing nothing didn't really
seem like an option for us.

819
01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:26.902
I mean. I don't think we're the
type of group that's going to

820
01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:29.447
just sit around and
wait for things to happen.

821
01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.490
And I was happy to
be doing something.

822
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.243
but playing drums in a
bubble is a struggle.

823
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.371
So it was hard to figure
out what was stressing me out.

824
01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:42.376
But I guess it was just the
dystopian things about it.

825
01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:50.301
You're hearing all these fans
and motors going constantly.

826
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.346
And just after a while. you're
not seeing people's mouths.

827
01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:58.142
And so you're not picking up
on people's moods very well.

828
01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:01.979
We did it I think as
much for us and our sanity.

829
01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:05.483
Like. I used to say. there
are three stages of how you

830
01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:07.026
experience your own performance.

831
01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:09.695
There's first level.

832
01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.364
Your equipment's fucking up.

833
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.782
You're fucking up.

834
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.617
And it's just the
worst fucking thing ever.

835
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.744
Number two is
nothing's going wrong.

836
01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.080
You're really not able to just
really enjoy it because you're

837
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.748
too nervous. even though
nothing wrong is happening.

838
01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:23.167
And then the top tier is
everything is working.

839
01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:24.502
You're not
worried about anything.

840
01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.671
Everybody loves it.
And it sounds great.

841
01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:28.339
And you're just
able to enjoy it.

842
01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:29.507
And whenever you
get one of those.

843
01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:30.967
you're like. "ha!"

844
01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:34.679
I felt like it was safer to
take him to the space bubble

845
01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.515
show than it was even to take
him to the grocery store where

846
01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.767
he is touching the cart and
touching everything else.

847
01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:42.895
So. it was his fun COVID outing.

848
01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:47.066
♪drums♪

849
01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.205
I think our live show was
getting better and better as we

850
01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:02.164
went.

851
01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.834
That was like peak people
were playing at their best.

852
01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.752
The sound man's got it...

853
01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.129
as good as it's going to get.

854
01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:10.881
I think for me personally. I
burn out and I come back and

855
01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:12.216
then I burn out.

856
01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.301
I want to make music really
bad for a while and I make that

857
01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.637
music and we do stuff together
and then we get done with them.

858
01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.597
I'm like I can watch TV
for a couple of weeks here.

859
01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.684
I'm good.

860
01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.852
I was feeling so sick last
night after the vaccine...

861
01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.562
I was just like...

862
01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.523
feeling all the weird symptoms.

863
01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:30.062
So we do these first nine
shows. and though they're very

864
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.316
stressful and
they're exhausting.

865
01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:39.321
it really does go better and
better each night that we go and

866
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.117
the audience gets better. and
the audience gets louder and

867
01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:46.245
it's more amazing
and more amazing.

868
01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:50.958
And from what we can tell.
there's not one single case of

869
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:55.421
COVID that's been transmitted
at the shows and it's just going

870
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.464
better than ever.

871
01:17:57.464 --> 01:18:00.885
And so we decide to
add this last show.

872
01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.387
We think it's going to be the
last show that we're going to do

873
01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.055
on April 20th.

874
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:08.726
It's going to be a show where
we play the entire American Head

875
01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:10.394
album.

876
01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:15.399
We're so proud that we
get to play for you.

877
01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:20.446
I think you've shown such a
great example to everyone around

878
01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.032
the world of how...

879
01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.451
This is how we could do it.

880
01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.287
There's lots of people who
would say wouldn't it be funny

881
01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:33.083
to have a whole concert
where everybody's in a bubble?

882
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:36.754
And. of course. Wayne took that
and made a cartoon out of it

883
01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.714
early on in the pandemic.

884
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:43.177
But I think it's just so typical
and magical of Wayne Coyne and

885
01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:45.095
the Flaming Lips.

886
01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:50.100
Part of us feels optimistic and
a little strange about it that

887
01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.979
by the time we play
this show on April 20th.

888
01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.774
the pandemic might even be over
and maybe there wouldn't be any

889
01:18:56.774 --> 01:19:00.527
need to be inside space bubbles.

890
01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:04.949
But as we know now. that
didn't prove to be that true.

891
01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:09.954
And so even at the end
of the very last show.

892
01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:15.417
all things
connected with COVID-19.

893
01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:20.422
and this year of the pandemic.
you don't really know when it's

894
01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:25.761
over and when is the end.
