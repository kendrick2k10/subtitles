00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:18.897
That's the judge. [laughs]

175
00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:24.441
Full house. I see.

176
00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.045
Okay. everybody sit down.

177
00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:32.792
First up on the docket is.
uh. Mr. Langdon Marshall.

178
00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:34.595
LANGDON'S LAWYER:
That's you.

179
00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:37.434
Mr. Marshall. I understand
you were arrested

180
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:41.442
for public intoxication
and indecency. is that correct?

181
00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:44.281
Indecency! [laughs]

182
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:44.381
Indecency! [laughs]
Keep it down
or it's back to lockup.

183
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:46.185
Keep it down
or it's back to lockup.

184
00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:48.089
[laughs] Yeah.

185
00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:51.963
Tell me what happened.
Mr. Marshall.

186
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.567
We was hanging out at Dusty's.

187
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:54.870
There was a line at the john.

188
00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:57.608
so I went outside
to do my business.

189
00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:00.848
Next thing I know.
this cop throws a light on me.

190
00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:04.121
I. I turn around and...
and everybody saw my junk.

191
00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.023
[Willis laughs]

192
00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:08.329
Mr. Marshall.
you've been arrested twice.

193
00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:13.305
once for public intoxication.
once for public urination.

194
00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:16.145
and once for trespassing
while trying to steal beer

195
00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:16.178
and once for trespassing
while trying to steal beer
from a neighbor's garage.

196
00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:17.882
from a neighbor's garage.

197
00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.953
You got a problem with alcohol?

198
00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:22.424
Problem with alcohol?
Who doesn't?

199
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.894
-KIM: Okay.
-Woohoo!

200
00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:26.098
Hey. when I'm speaking.
you zip it.

201
00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.604
Otherwise. we're gonna
have a problem. mister.

202
00:09:29.137 --> 00:09:32.745
Oh. you want a problem. woman?
I got a problem with you.

203
00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:34.916
-Yes. I do.
-LAWYER: Wait. wait. bailiff!

204
00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:37.488
You're the problem. yeah!

Freeze! Everybody just chill.

208
00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:45.136
Freeze! Everybody just chill.

209
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.342
[inhaler whistles]

210
00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.348
[Kim sighs]

211
00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:56.793
I'm sweating like
a whore in church.

212
00:09:56.893 --> 00:09:58.295
Of course. that could have
something to do

213
00:09:58.295 --> 00:09:58.329
Of course. that could have
something to do
with me getting attacked.

214
00:09:58.329 --> 00:09:59.498
with me getting attacked.

215
00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.070
It's my fault. Your Honor.
I should not have left my post.

216
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.542
-Oh. I asked you to.
-VICKY: Still.

217
00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:05.844
Don't beat yourself up.

218
00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.848
Clearly.
I can take care of myself.

219
00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:09.686
Judge. we have a problem.

220
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.722
What's that?

221
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:11.823
Tomorrow is the. uh.

222
00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:14.996
hearing for the Dirk Crawford
murder case.

223
00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:16.098
Dirk Crawford?

224
00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:18.771
Ran his best friend off
the road for dating his ex.

225
00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:20.006
Still doesn't ring a bell.

226
00:10:20.072 --> 00:10:22.979
That's because it was left off
of your schedule.

227
00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.216
Technically. my mistake.
but the judge's assistant

228
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:28.022
usually double checks
these things.

229
00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:31.563
Bottom line. you're due
in Tonopah tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

230
00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:32.965
Tonopah? Well.
that's quite a trek.

231
00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:35.169
A hundred-and-sixty-seven miles.

232
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:35.203
A hundred-and-sixty-seven miles.
We'll leave after work.

233
00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:36.005
We'll leave after work.

234
00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:37.842
stay the night
at the Mitzvah Hotel.

235
00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:39.512
The courthouse
is right next door.

236
00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:40.781
Can't we postpone?

237
00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.986
It's a motion to dismiss
for a lack of a speedy trial.

238
00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:45.891
so I don't think that
would be prudent.

239
00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.997
The passing of Judge Brewer
has been difficult on all sides.

240
00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:52.504

Mm. that smells good.

245
00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:03.894
You will know the Lord

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:06.933
when He gives you meat
in the evening. Exodus.

247
00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:12.778
Okay. I got venison. sausage.
eggs. and buttered sourdough.

248
00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:15.216
You know there's 41 carbs
in that single slice of bread.

249
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.418
Ooh. carb smart.

250
00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:19.124
You're gonna need your energy
if you travel with me. girl.

251
00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:19.157
You're gonna need your energy
if you travel with me. girl.
Here's you a fork.

252
00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:20.026
Here's you a fork.

253
00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:24.736
[chuckles] This is quite
the rig you got.

254
00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:27.107
Well. thank you.
Had it custom made.

255
00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:30.581
Twin-turbo V8. chipped
with a custom camper.

256
00:11:30.747 --> 00:11:32.751
Oh yeah? Well. 17 more payments

257
00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:35.156
and that little baby
is all mine.

-Those are engines. right?

-Oh. my God.

Oh. you have officially

268
00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:02.443
No. not smiling. Not smiling.

No. not smiling. Not smiling.
Although you have to admit.

Although you have to admit.

271
00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.784
a hammer's a pretty good
nickname for a judge.

272

Hmm. There you go.

273
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.930
I unfortunately
do not eat meat.

274
00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.801
It's not meat. it's sausage.
Now eat.

-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

You homeless?

280
00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.105
Why would you ask me that?

281
00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.942
The. the camper.
the sleeping bag.

282
00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:37.014
and no disrespect. Your Honor.

283
00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:39.284

you have not showered.

I take a bath regularly
if that's what you're asking.

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.503
I can help you find a place
if you need.

287
00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:53.547
No thanks. I like to sleep
where I can see the stars.

288
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.517
All right. but you know
that Judge Brewer

289
00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:55.551
All right. but you know
that Judge Brewer
received death threats?

290
00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:56.953
received death threats?

291
00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:59.224
Yeah. And he died
of a heart attack.

292
00:12:59.357 --> 00:13:01.461
Clearly.
I can take care of myself.

293

if I witness a crime
as it's happening?

302
00:13:18.863 --> 00:13:21.168
I guess take the action
most prudent.

303
00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:22.672
All right then.
Can you slow the hell down?

304

343
00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.835
[gentle upbeat music continues]

344
00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:20.173
[hands tapping]

345
00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:22.811
Evening. ma'am.
What's your poison?

346
00:15:22.978 --> 00:15:24.549
-Well. hi there...
-Vance.

347
00:15:24.648 --> 00:15:27.154
Vance. uh. well.
I prefer an old fashioned.

348
00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:29.658
but I'll settle on a diet soda.

349
00:15:29.658 --> 00:15:29.726
but I'll settle on a diet soda.
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

350
00:15:29.726 --> 00:15:31.863
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

351
00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:34.201
CUSTOMER:
Hey. Vance. you got my order?

352
00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:37.508
Sure do.
There's your bottle. buddy.

353
00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:37.542
Sure do.
There's your bottle. buddy.
CUSTOMER:
Thanks.

354
00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.111
CUSTOMER:
Thanks.

355
00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:40.848
You sell booze to go?

356
00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:42.985
I didn't realize
that was still being done.

357
00:15:43.085 --> 00:15:45.222
Yes. ma'am.
Whatever the customer wants.

358
00:15:46.057 --> 00:15:47.828
Can I ask what brings you
to our neck of the woods.

359
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.634
Uh. court. I'm the new judge.

360
00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:50.700
Uh. court. I'm the new judge.
The Hammer. right?
Congratulations.

361
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.540
The Hammer. right?
Congratulations.

362
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.509
First time in Tonopah?

363
00:15:54.608 --> 00:15:58.048
No. I grew up around here.
How about you?

364
00:15:58.248 --> 00:15:59.117
Born and raised.

365
00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:02.157
Mm. Married. got any family?

366
00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:06.098
Eh. there's a special lady.
but it's complicated.

367
00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:08.202
Yeah. can relate to that.

368
00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.542
-Love what you did to the place.
-BART: Thank you.

369
00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:11.576
-Love what you did to the place.
-BART: Thank you.
[upbeat lively music]

370
00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:16.018
[upbeat lively music]

371
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:17.254
How about a little splash
of whiskey

372
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.557
in that drink. Your Honor?

373
00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:22.163
Not opposed. but I do like
to know who I'm drinking with.

374
00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:23.867
I'm the owner
of this establishment.

375
00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:25.571
-Bart Crawford.
-Ah-ha.

376
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.576
well. I'm the judge
in your son's case.

377
00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:31.215
and any conversation
outside the courtroom

378
00:16:31.314 --> 00:16:34.320
would be construed
as a conflict of interest.

379
00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:36.926
Only interest I have is
in getting to know you better.

380
00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:38.596
Well. well. if you've got
something to say.

381
00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:38.597
Well. well. if you've got
something to say.
go ahead and say it

382
00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:39.397
go ahead and say it

383
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.802
'cause I'm fixing
to enjoy my evening.

384
00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:41.836
'cause I'm fixing
to enjoy my evening.
Just wanna say welcome.

385
00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.239
Just wanna say welcome.

386
00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:45.276
We residents of Tonopah
are thrilled to have

387
00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:48.049
a legal mind of your caliber
on the bench.

388
00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:49.619
I hope you don't
mind me saying this.

389
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:52.057
but you remind me
of that serpent in the Bible.

390
00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:54.327
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

391
00:16:54.427 --> 00:16:57.333
Well. historically.
the serpent's a symbol

392
00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:01.007
of fertility and renewal
of the life force.

393
00:17:01.174 --> 00:17:02.611
Not very subtle. are you?

394
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:02.645
Not very subtle. are you?
-May I?
-Help yourself.

395
00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:04.915
-May I?
-Help yourself.

396
00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:06.519
The governor's
a friend of mine.

397
00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:08.756
When he mentioned your name
to replace Judge Brewer.

398
00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:08.790
When he mentioned your name
to replace Judge Brewer.
I endorsed your wholeheartedly.

399
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.596
I endorsed your wholeheartedly.

400
00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:14.234
As a lawyer. no one in this
state's done more for victims

401
00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.271
of abuse and discrimination
than you have.

402
00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:17.708
Well. thank you for that.

403
00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:20.012
So. you're a friend
of the governor. huh?

404
00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:22.551
BART:
I am. we. we met in Princeton

405
00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:25.189
for my two decades
in Silicon Valley.

406
00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:27.093
So you're a techie. [chuckles]

407
00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:29.064
I bet this place
bores you to tears.

408
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.433
Well. no. On the contrary.

409
00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:33.005
Nevada's a land
of untapped potential.

410
00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:35.476
I'm very excited
about being back.

411
00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:38.148
Your Honor. Bart.

412
00:17:38.248 --> 00:17:41.956
[grunts] You ladies going
out on the town tonight?

413
00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:43.626
I could arrange a special table.

414
00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:43.660
I could arrange a special table.
Thanks. but we're good.

415
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.097
Thanks. but we're good.

416
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.104
You two enjoy your evening.

417
00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:51.609
Judge Wheeler.
very nice to meet you.

418
00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:54.080
Mr. Crawford.

419
00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:56.185
BART:
Victoria.

420
00:17:56.284 --> 00:18:00.727
[laughs] I didn't take you
for a saloon girl.

421
00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:03.098
Hey. I was just sitting
here minding my own business.

422
00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:04.067
Sure. but if I was you.

423
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.204
I'd stay away
from Bart Crawford.

424
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:08.810
He's always reminded me
of that snake in the Bible.

425
00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:11.215
Vance.

426
00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:13.920
[gentle upbeat music]

427
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.730
[♪♪♪♪♪]

428
00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:28.783
[cellphone ringing]

429
00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.187
VICKY:
Mm.

430
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.628
Mm.

431
00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:40.339
[clears throat]
This better be good.

432
00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:43.279
FRIEND:
Hey honey. it is.

433
00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:46.018
The autopsy just came
back on Judge Brewer.

434
00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:47.888
It looks like he was
murdered.

435
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.259
Yeah. Okay. thanks.

436
00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:53.065
[dramatic tense music]

437
00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:57.674
[♪♪♪♪♪]

438
00:19:07.728 --> 00:19:11.368
Judge Wheeler. Judge Wheeler!

439
00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:16.613
What are you.
some kind of new rooster?

440
00:19:16.712 --> 00:19:18.482
I thought I saw someone
sneaking about.

441
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.954
Maybe it's the Mitzvah ghost.

442
00:19:20.954 --> 00:19:21.054
Maybe it's the Mitzvah ghost.
And you said you'd sleep
in a room tonight.

443
00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:22.490
And you said you'd sleep
in a room tonight.

444
00:19:22.624 --> 00:19:24.995
I tried. but it was so stuffy.

445
00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.467
What are you doing
down here anyway?

446
00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.171
VICKY:
I just got off the phone
with a friend.

447
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.107
The autopsy for Judge Brewer
just came back.

448
00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:32.343
He was murdered.

449
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:36.217
[dramatic tense music]

450
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:40.794
[gentle upbeat music]

451
00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:42.964
-KIM: Good morning.
-VICKY: Good morning.

452
00:19:42.964 --> 00:19:43.031
-KIM: Good morning.
-VICKY: Good morning.
-All clean. Wanna check?
-I trust you.

453
00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:45.604
-All clean. Wanna check?
-I trust you.

454
00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:48.610
Okay. so how close
is the courthouse?

455
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.914
-Eh. I'd say it's pretty close.
-Mm-hmm.

456
00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:55.824
Judge. I have to say
I'm concerned.

457
00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.193
What about?

458
00:19:57.326 --> 00:19:58.328
Well. we just learned
that the man

459
00:19:58.462 --> 00:19:59.598
that you replaced was killed.

460
00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.370
and then there was a stranger
in white snakeskin boots

461
00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:05.209
creeping around your truck
last night.

462
00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.179
How are you completely
unfazed by all this?

463
00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.850
You're not worried
you could be next?

464
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.490
Oh. it's just the way I am.
calm under the pressure.

465
00:20:12.591 --> 00:20:15.898
So. any more information
back from your friend?

466
00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:18.335
They have a suspect.
but that's all he could tell me.

467
00:20:18.536 --> 00:20:21.107
Is he a boyfriend?

468
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:23.445
Oh. we went on a date or two.

469
00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:26.184
-Is he in law enforcement?
-He's a deputy.

470
00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:27.854
Any more questions
in this interrogation?

471
00:20:27.888 --> 00:20:30.225
No. not right now. but I'm sure
I'll think of something.

472
00:20:30.425 --> 00:20:32.396
[both chuckling]

473
00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.269
[people chattering indistinctly]

474
00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:38.876
You're right. It is close.

475
00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:38.877
You're right. It is close.
[chuckles] You ready?

476
00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.647
[chuckles] You ready?

477
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.682
Mm-hmm.

478
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.721
VICKY:
All rise.

479
00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:48.161
Fifth District Court
of the State of Nevada

480
00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:49.264
is now in session.

481
00:20:49.363 --> 00:20:52.002
The honorable Kim Wheeler
now presiding.

482
00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:54.875
Y'all sit down.

483
00:20:58.783 --> 00:21:01.789
All right. we've gathered today

484
00:21:01.922 --> 00:21:04.060
to hear a motion
to dismiss in the case

485
00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:08.202
of The People v. Dirk Crawford
on the charge of murder.

486
00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:09.404
Okay. I've read the brief.

487
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.511
Any additional information
for me. Mr. Goodlander?

488
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.080
Your Honor.
the late Judge Brewer acted

489
00:21:14.347 --> 00:21:16.686
with bias towards Mr. Crawford
by denying him bail

490
00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:18.556
and leaving him incarcerated
these past eight months

491
00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:21.060
despite the fact
he poses no flight risk.

492
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.128
despite the fact
he poses no flight risk.
Dirk Crawford.
the son of Bart Crawford.

493
00:21:21.128 --> 00:21:23.265
Dirk Crawford.
the son of Bart Crawford.

494
00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:24.802
the one that owns
the large solar farm

495
00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:26.404
-along the highway?
-Yes. Your Honor.

496
00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:27.508
but I don't see
how that's relevant.

497
00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:30.279
Well. he possesses the means
to evade judgment.

498
00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.082
I'm gonna side
with Judge Brewer on this.

499
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:32.083
I'm gonna side
with Judge Brewer on this.
What else you got?

500
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:32.984
What else you got?

501
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.657
Judge Wheeler.
the actions of Judge Brewer

502
00:21:35.757 --> 00:21:37.628
denied my client his right
to a speedy trial.

503
00:21:37.794 --> 00:21:38.663
and every day that goes by

504
00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:40.667
further prejudices
Mr. Crawford's case.

505
00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:42.538
-In what way?
-My client's defense hinges

506
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.307
on the testimony
of eyewitnesses.

507
00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:45.877
Their ability to recall
the events in question

508
00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:49.117
could be negatively affected
by the passage of time.

509
00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:52.223
You're afraid that a bunch
of small-town teenagers

510
00:21:52.423 --> 00:21:53.560
won't remember the night

511
00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:55.631
that one of their own
was killed?

512
00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:58.936
-Your Honor. may I approach?
-Yeah. come on up.

513
00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:03.111
You better start
acting remorseful. son.

514
00:22:03.111 --> 00:22:03.112
You better start
acting remorseful. son.
and I mean right now.

515
00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:04.548
and I mean right now.

516
00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:05.683
With all due respect. Judge.

517
00:22:05.817 --> 00:22:06.919
you may not be aware
of the depth

518
00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:09.558
of animosity that exists
between the late Judge Brewer

519
00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:10.794
and the senior Mr. Crawford.

520
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.465
Your Honor. this is all
clearly a calculated attempt

521
00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.436
to introduce the idea
that the witnesses scheduled

522
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.574
to testify can't be trusted

523
00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:19.511
to remember events
as they occurred.

524
00:22:19.578 --> 00:22:23.118
Mr. Goodlander. I may be new.
but I wasn't born yesterday.

525
00:22:23.118 --> 00:22:23.185
Mr. Goodlander. I may be new.
but I wasn't born yesterday.
-Motion denied.

526
00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:24.988
-Motion denied.

527
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.361
-ELLIS: Told you.
-KIM: Okay.

528
00:22:29.463 --> 00:22:31.134
In the interest
of a speedy trial.

529
00:22:31.134 --> 00:22:31.235
In the interest
of a speedy trial.
we can begin jury
selection immediately.

530
00:22:31.235 --> 00:22:34.641
we can begin jury
selection immediately.

531
00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:37.446
-Who does the calendar here?
-Your assistant.

532
00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:40.486
Crap. I was afraid of that.

533
00:22:40.587 --> 00:22:46.298
All righty then.
Looks like I'm free Monday.

534
00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:48.435
Monday good with everyone?

535
00:22:48.603 --> 00:22:49.404
-Yes. ma'am.
-Yes.

536
00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:53.178
Okay. see you boys then.
Court adjourned.

537
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:54.748
All rise.

538
00:22:56.518 --> 00:22:58.054
[upbeat lively music]

539
00:22:58.054 --> 00:22:58.089
[upbeat lively music]
Thank you. Council.

540
00:22:58.089 --> 00:23:00.393
Thank you. Council.

541
00:23:00.492 --> 00:23:02.429
-See you later.
-ELLIS: Thank you.

542
00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:05.001
Oh. pretty.

543
00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.874
Oh. I was meaning to ask you.
the young man who died.

544
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:09.946
was any of his family
in the courtroom today?

545
00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:13.184
No. He only has an uncle
that lives in a VA home.

546
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:13.218
No. He only has an uncle
that lives in a VA home.
Wow. well how about the blond

547
00:23:13.218 --> 00:23:15.489
Wow. well how about the blond

548
00:23:15.623 --> 00:23:16.526
that was sitting
by Bart Crawford?

549
00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:19.297
Oh. that's Charlene.
his ex. Dirk's mom.

550
00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:20.165
What's her story?

551
00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:20.232
What's her story?
Probably exactly
what you think.

552
00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.536
Probably exactly
what you think.

553
00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:22.571
Ex-beauty queen who's used

554
00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:24.675
to getting everything
that she wants.

555
00:23:24.775 --> 00:23:26.244
Rumor is she broke
a lot of hearts around here

556
00:23:26.512 --> 00:23:28.649
trying to make Bart jealous.
but he still divorced her.

557
00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:30.587
Well. why was she giving me
the evil eye?

558
00:23:30.653 --> 00:23:33.091
Probably 'cause she thought
you'd dismiss her son's case.

559
00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:36.933
Hmm. you know anything
about the beef

560
00:23:37.066 --> 00:23:38.803
between Bart Crawford
and Judge Brewer?

561
00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:40.674
No details. just
that he threatened

562
00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:42.645
to kill the judge
in front of witnesses.

563
00:23:42.811 --> 00:23:44.515
You think he could be a killer?

564
00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:45.550
It's not the first time
a parent killed

565
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.353
-to protect a child.

566
00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:49.023
KIM:
Excuse me.

567
00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:52.631
Mm. Judge Carpenter
wants me to stop by

568
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.066
and have a little chat
when we get back.

569
00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.704
Oh. lucky you.

570
00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:57.941
KIM:
Great. Thanks for the warning.

571
00:23:57.941 --> 00:23:57.975
KIM:
Great. Thanks for the warning.
[bright upbeat music]

572
00:23:57.975 --> 00:24:00.747
[bright upbeat music]

573
00:24:01.615 --> 00:24:03.553
Your Honor. I'm Kim Wheeler.

574
00:24:03.653 --> 00:24:06.190
Oh. hello. Kim. call me Hank.
Have a seat.

575
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.191
Oh. hello. Kim. call me Hank.
Have a seat.
Thank you. sir.

576
00:24:06.191 --> 00:24:07.594
Thank you. sir.

577
00:24:08.562 --> 00:24:09.765
You like moose?

578
00:24:09.898 --> 00:24:11.569
Owner flew it in
fresh from Alaska.

579
00:24:11.702 --> 00:24:13.973
Oh. thank you. no.
I've already eaten.

580
00:24:13.973 --> 00:24:14.007
Oh. thank you. no.
I've already eaten.
You know. I must admit

581
00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:16.478
You know. I must admit

582
00:24:16.578 --> 00:24:18.583
you are not
what I was expecting.

583
00:24:18.683 --> 00:24:20.654
No. I was picturing
some highfalutin type

584
00:24:20.853 --> 00:24:22.389
with a designer suit

585
00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:23.959
and a face full
of plastic surgery.

586
00:24:23.959 --> 00:24:24.829
[both chuckling]

587
00:24:24.928 --> 00:24:27.266
Well. I consider myself
low maintenance.

588
00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:27.300
Well. I consider myself
low maintenance.
-Is that a fact?
-Yes. sir.

589
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.003
-Is that a fact?
-Yes. sir.

590
00:24:29.036 --> 00:24:30.807
Well. first off. let me
welcome you to the territory.

591
00:24:30.873 --> 00:24:32.811
-Oh. thank you. Thank you.
-Seemed like you had

592
00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:34.715
an eventful first few days. huh?

593
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:36.552
Oh. nothing I couldn't handle.

594
00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:39.257
Eh. your quick reflex
is to be commended.

595
00:24:40.092 --> 00:24:41.996
No doubt that boy never knew
what hit him.

596
00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:43.465
Well. that was
a regrettable sit--

597
00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:45.402
And now they call you
the Hammer.

598
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.006
-Mm-hmm.
-What is that?

599
00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:49.277
That's a--
that's a catchy nickname.

600
00:24:49.544 --> 00:24:53.452
Again. regrettable. Hank.
but to change the subject.

601
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:54.788
I'm sure you're aware

602
00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:58.830
that the courthouse needs
some serious security upgrades.

603
00:24:58.863 --> 00:25:01.100
I wouldn't hold your breath
waiting for change around here.

604
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.101
I wouldn't hold your breath
waiting for change around here.
-No?
-Mm-mm.

605
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:02.470
-No?
-Mm-mm.

606
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.073
I've been a judge
in this district

607
00:25:04.073 --> 00:25:05.643
for over 20 years.

608
00:25:05.743 --> 00:25:07.981
Now. rural Nevada
is a tough country.

609
00:25:08.949 --> 00:25:10.721
People like to think
it's the old West.

610
00:25:10.887 --> 00:25:12.925
you know. old fashioned values.

611
00:25:13.024 --> 00:25:16.197
Eh. to be a judge in
this district takes grit.

612
00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:20.640
What happened to Jacob Brewer
is. uh. proof of that.

613
00:25:21.207 --> 00:25:22.878
What exactly
you trying to say. Hank?

614
00:25:22.977 --> 00:25:25.683
Well. what I'm trying
to say is that. uh...

615
00:25:27.186 --> 00:25:30.059
[chuckles] ...this is no place
for a woman. Kim.

616
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:33.933
I mean. life here isn't like
life in the big city.

617
00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:36.304
You can't walk 10 feet
without running into something

618
00:25:36.304 --> 00:25:36.371
You can't walk 10 feet
without running into something
that wants to eat you
or bite you

619
00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:37.808
that wants to eat you
or bite you

620
00:25:37.974 --> 00:25:39.811
or stick you or sting you.

621
00:25:39.911 --> 00:25:42.149
-I was born and raised here.
-No. the truth is...

622
00:25:43.786 --> 00:25:45.590
I think the governor made
a mistake hiring you.

623
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.925
That's plain and simple.

624
00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:48.663
I mean it's nothing personal.

625
00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:50.900
but. uh. I'm just not sure
that a woman.

626
00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:53.071
but. or any woman
has what it takes

627
00:25:53.204 --> 00:25:55.009
to do the job
the way it should be--

628
00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:58.650
In all do respect. Your Honor.
I disagree with you.

629
00:25:58.816 --> 00:25:59.551
You know. there's no shame

630
00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:01.555
in reconsidering
your appointment.

631
00:26:01.722 --> 00:26:02.924
No one will blame you.

632
00:26:03.826 --> 00:26:05.730
You're a topnotch lawyer. Kim.

633
00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:06.866
Surely there must be other.

634
00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:08.936
more lucrative avenues
you'd like to explore.

635
00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:11.074
Again. with all due respect.

636
00:26:11.207 --> 00:26:13.145
I think
you're underestimating me.

637
00:26:13.211 --> 00:26:15.850
So. if there's nothing else
you need to discuss with me.

638
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.687
I'll let you get on
with your dinner.

639
00:26:17.787 --> 00:26:21.394
Well. in that case.
there is one more thing.

640
00:26:21.628 --> 00:26:22.931
Yes. sir.

641
00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:26.539
Are you aware
of the Drug Court program?

642
00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:29.009
12-step program? Absolutely.

643
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.515
There's no telling
how many chemically-dependent.

644
00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:32.584
non-violent criminals

645
00:26:32.717 --> 00:26:35.088
that it's helped get
back on their feet.

646
00:26:35.222 --> 00:26:36.491
Well. I'm turning
it over to you.

647
00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:37.727
Really?

648
00:26:37.827 --> 00:26:40.265
I mean. that's work best
suited for a woman anyway.

649
00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.539
I mean. you know. a lot
of hand holding and scolding.

650
00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:46.377
Better suited for you girls
in Tonopah.

651
00:26:46.377 --> 00:26:46.477
Better suited for you girls
in Tonopah.
Now. I'm having my secretary
send over

652
00:26:46.477 --> 00:26:47.848
Now. I'm having my secretary
send over

653
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:50.019
the case documents with Jo.

654
00:26:50.152 --> 00:26:52.022
First session's this afternoon.

655
00:26:53.224 --> 00:26:54.227
Hmm.

656
00:26:54.293 --> 00:26:57.132
Now. I'm sure you girls
will do a bang-up job.

657
00:26:57.132 --> 00:26:57.133
Now. I'm sure you girls
will do a bang-up job.
Good luck.

658
00:26:57.133 --> 00:26:58.134
Good luck.

659
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.678
-Thank you. sir.
-Sure you won't have something?

660
00:27:02.877 --> 00:27:04.413
I'm good. Thank you.

661
00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:04.447
I'm good. Thank you.

662

663
00:27:11.227 --> 00:27:12.730
VICKY:
All rise.

664
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.433
Fifth District Court
of the State of Nevada

665
00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:15.435
is now in session.

666
00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:15.504

The Honorable Kim Wheeler
now presiding.

668
00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:21.615
Congratulations on receiving
your GED. Ms. Allen.

669
00:27:21.715 --> 00:27:23.686
I think that deserves
a round of applause.

670
00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:27.392
[all clapping]

671
00:27:27.392 --> 00:27:27.459
[all clapping]
And for coming
to us clean today.

672
00:27:27.459 --> 00:27:28.997
And for coming
to us clean today.

673
00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:31.835
which our Drug Court supervisor
can confirm.

674
00:27:32.904 --> 00:27:34.708
-Yes. Your Honor.
-Thank you.

675
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:36.712
And before you go. stop by

676
00:27:36.845 --> 00:27:39.049
and see Ms. Greg
in the court office.

677
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:42.089
She has a list of some
trustworthy sitters

678
00:27:42.189 --> 00:27:44.293
that can watch your child
while you're at work.

679
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.436
Okay. next up. Angel Brown.

680
00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:53.278
How do. Ms. Brown?

681
00:27:53.344 --> 00:27:56.150
I see you've completed
step 12 of the program.

682
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.918
Yes. Your Honor.

683
00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:58.523
And you come to
us clean today.

684
00:27:58.756 --> 00:27:59.791
Yes.

685
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.697
Ms. Brown. I'm sure
you've heard the saying.

686
00:28:02.864 --> 00:28:04.668
the truth will set you free.

687
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:05.937
Well. one thing
you'll learn about me.

688
00:28:06.103 --> 00:28:07.608
I can't tolerate a liar.

689
00:28:07.807 --> 00:28:09.711
I'm. I'm not lying.

690
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:11.380
Mr. Stevenson?

691
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:16.290
Your Honor. her most
recent tests showed

692
00:28:16.357 --> 00:28:19.597
Ms. Brown had over
1.200 nanograms per milliliter

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:20.667

694
00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:22.670

methamphetamines

you'll learn from yours.

702
00:28:31.454 --> 00:28:33.058
Now. I'm gonna give
you a couple of days

703

Not much. She used

Not much. She used

Judge Brewer sentenced her
to Drug Court late last year.

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:02.885
Yeah. records show

720
00:29:02.984 --> 00:29:04.955

Any chance things could have
gone wrong on this test?

I doubt it.
Urine collection is supervised

724
00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:15.976
and then the test is picked up
by the local lab.

725
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.315
And you've never heard
of anything going wrong before?

726
00:29:18.348 --> 00:29:19.751
Nope.

727
00:29:19.851 --> 00:29:21.823
Although there was one girl.
Eileen Price.

728
00:29:22.022 --> 00:29:22.824
she tested positive.

729
00:29:22.957 --> 00:29:23.826

the wrong name

Mm. Kim. he can barely
afford the pain meds.

Besides. he gets all paranoid

857
00:35:44.787 --> 00:35:47.593
Kris. wake up.
Where's Mama's gun?

858
00:35:50.933 --> 00:35:54.473
Okay. look. Kimmie.
I don't think that I buried it.

859
00:35:54.574 --> 00:35:56.945
Now. I know that
I buried Daddy's car keys

860
00:35:57.212 --> 00:36:01.320
and his shotgun shells
in the backyard. but oh God.

861
00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:03.926
Oh. my gosh. [gasps]

Oh. my gosh.
Do you know what year this is?

867
00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:12.343
Look at how beautiful
Mama looks in this picture.

868
00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:14.514
Kris. please focus.

869
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.387
Okay. well. it's not my fault
I was over-served.

870
00:36:18.454 --> 00:36:20.559
You know you should wear
your hair like this again.

871
00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:24.199
I'm telling you.
it's much more approachable.

872

873
00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:36.758

[exhales] Do you mind?

886
00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:24.386
It's all yours.

around here.

How do you like
your coffee. Judge?

891
00:37:37.813 --> 00:37:40.719
Percolated over a camp fire
thick as molasses.

892
00:37:41.988 --> 00:37:43.458
Black or cream and sugar?

893
00:37:43.592 --> 00:37:46.363
-Black. please. Thank you.
-You bet.

894
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:47.967
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

895
00:37:48.969 --> 00:37:50.873
You're a bit far from home.
aren't you?

896
00:37:50.906 --> 00:37:54.447
Oh. I do business in Pahrump
so I can keep a place here.

897
00:37:54.547 --> 00:37:57.553
Is that so?
So. what can I do you for?

898
00:37:57.653 --> 00:38:00.191
Well. I'm guessing
you heard Judge Brewer

899
00:38:00.358 --> 00:38:01.327
and I didn't get along.

900
00:38:01.393 --> 00:38:02.663
Well. I've heard you
threatened to kill him.

901
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.368
-if that's what you mean.
-Well. that's why I'm here.

902
00:38:05.468 --> 00:38:08.609
While the facts are true.
context is missing.

903
00:38:08.742 --> 00:38:11.581
Right. Okay.
so contextualize away.

904
00:38:11.648 --> 00:38:15.388
Well. the judge and I
had an adversarial relationship.

905
00:38:15.454 --> 00:38:19.330
He was strongly opposed
to my. uh. solar farm.

906
00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:21.433
which he claimed
was bad for biodiversity.

907
00:38:21.534 --> 00:38:25.643
When I prevailed in court...
he was livid.

908
00:38:25.676 --> 00:38:28.949
And then your son got arrested.
and he was assigned to the case.

909
00:38:28.949 --> 00:38:28.982
And then your son got arrested.
and he was assigned to the case.
He refused to consider a plea.

910
00:38:28.982 --> 00:38:31.320
He refused to consider a plea.

911
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.090
and when he locked up Dirk
without bail.

912
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:33.157
and when he locked up Dirk
without bail.
we got into a. uh...
heated argument.

913
00:38:33.157 --> 00:38:38.602
we got into a. uh...
heated argument.

914
00:38:38.702 --> 00:38:40.706
-So. you have a temper?
-BART: I do.

915
00:38:40.806 --> 00:38:44.915
But. uh. I've worked hard
at controlling it.

916
00:38:45.649 --> 00:38:48.053
My son. unfortunately.
has the same issue.

917
00:38:49.624 --> 00:38:51.662
So. why are you telling me
all of this?

918
00:38:51.828 --> 00:38:52.830
Well. a couple of reasons.

919
00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:55.401
I know my son comes off
as an entitled teenager.

920
00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:57.105
but that's just an act.

921
00:38:57.105 --> 00:38:57.138
but that's just an act.
Truth is he's scared to death.

922
00:38:57.138 --> 00:38:59.075
Truth is he's scared to death.

923
00:38:59.075 --> 00:38:59.109
Truth is he's scared to death.
His best friend's dead.

924
00:38:59.109 --> 00:39:00.111
His best friend's dead.

925
00:39:00.111 --> 00:39:00.178
His best friend's dead.
and he hasn't come
to terms with it.

926
00:39:00.178 --> 00:39:02.516
and he hasn't come
to terms with it.

927
00:39:02.683 --> 00:39:04.787
But he will. I promise.

928
00:39:04.854 --> 00:39:07.760
-And the second reason?
-I didn't want you. uh.

929
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.931
going around thinking
I might be a murderer.

930
00:39:09.997 --> 00:39:12.101
So what? I'm supposed
to take your word for that.

931
00:39:12.135 --> 00:39:13.304
No. no.

932
00:39:13.404 --> 00:39:16.845
The hotel's got a network
of security cameras.

933
00:39:16.878 --> 00:39:20.451
Footage will show that I worked
long past midnight that night.

934
00:39:21.654 --> 00:39:23.758
Oh. excuse me.

936
00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.336
No. I was just leaving.

937

938
00:39:31.608 --> 00:39:33.444
-Thank you for the coffee.
-You bet.

Tell him I need access
to a sealed juvenile record.

945
00:39:53.618 --> 00:39:54.887
Whose record?

946
00:39:57.158 --> 00:39:58.427
Leo Stevenson?

947
00:39:58.528 --> 00:40:01.066
I don't have to tell you
to keep this confidential.

948
00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:01.100
I don't have to tell you
to keep this confidential.
-Of course not.
-Okay.

-Of course not.
-Okay.

What was Bart Crawford
doing here?

951
00:40:11.521 --> 00:40:13.391
He brought me coffee.

952
00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:15.629
I would watch out for him
if I were you.

954
00:40:20.037 --> 00:40:22.776

keep saying that?

[indistinct chattering
in distance]

959
00:40:50.799 --> 00:40:53.571
I need you to tell me
about Leo Stevenson.

960
00:40:55.474 --> 00:40:57.078
-What about him?
-The truth.

961
00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.815
You be honest with me

962
00:40:58.882 --> 00:41:01.788
and I promise I'll do everything
I can to help you.

963
00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:08.168
-Leo's like a real creep.
-How exactly?

964
00:41:08.868 --> 00:41:11.708
He. like. stands in the bathroom
when I give my sample.

965
00:41:11.841 --> 00:41:14.514
-He watches you urinate?
-Yeah.

966
00:41:14.714 --> 00:41:15.850
Is anybody else present?

967
00:41:15.982 --> 00:41:18.756
No. but he does it
to all the girls.

968
00:41:18.855 --> 00:41:21.327
He says it's to make sure
our pee's legit.

[tense suspenseful music]

970
00:41:26.036 --> 00:41:26.070
[tense suspenseful music]
Has he ever touched you?

971
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.073
Has he ever touched you?

972
00:41:28.073 --> 00:41:28.107
Has he ever touched you?
No. but he's always saying

973
00:41:28.107 --> 00:41:31.480
No. but he's always saying

974
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:33.150
how we should. like.
go out sometime.

975
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.183
how we should. like.
go out sometime.
Have you ever gone out with him?

976
00:41:33.183 --> 00:41:34.319
Have you ever gone out with him?

977
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.092
Ew! Gross.

978
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.466
I just. like. laugh it off.
pretend he's joking.

979
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:43.939
-Has he ever threatened you?
-No.

980
00:41:43.972 --> 00:41:47.179
He. he just says things
like. if I wanna test clean.

981

-I gotta be nice to him.
-Oh honey. that is a threat.

982

Why haven't you told anybody
about this?

983
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.737
Uh... I didn't think
anyone would believe me.

984
00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:01.708
I do.

KIM:
Being with that girl today

987
00:42:08.655 --> 00:42:12.763
at the jail reminded me
of me when I was her age.

988
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.199
Back then. all I wanted to do

989
00:42:14.299 --> 00:42:16.938
is have this town
in my rear view mirror.

990
00:42:17.773 --> 00:42:18.875
KRIS:
It's all right.

991
00:42:19.042 --> 00:42:21.480
And I guess that's what I did.

992
00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:24.620
Kris. I'm sorry
I ran out on you last time.

993
00:42:25.922 --> 00:42:28.127
Least I could have done
was to leave a note.

994
00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:29.262
You hated it here.

995
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:31.968
No. I hated the situation.
I didn't hate the location.

996
00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:37.211
Maybe so. but...
I left you alone with him.

997
00:42:37.211 --> 00:42:37.245
Maybe so. but...
I left you alone with him.
I shouldn't have done that.

998
00:42:37.245 --> 00:42:38.882
I shouldn't have done that.

999
00:42:39.048 --> 00:42:40.785
It's my fault you left.

1000
00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:42.924
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1001
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:44.994
Yeah. I was really mad at that.

1002
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:48.668
But I'm not mad anymore.
All gone.

1003
00:42:48.802 --> 00:42:50.404

Well. hallelujah to that.

1005
00:42:51.974 --> 00:42:54.079
Uh. why?

-KRIS: Wait'll you meet him.

1007

-KIM: Who's this.
-KRIS: Wait'll you meet him.
This is the boy wonder

What now. Wayne?

00:43:12.348 --> 00:43:15.221
Oh. Wayne. you know my sister?

1017
00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:21.133
We've. uh. met. and. uh.
I'm sorry about this. Kris.

1018
00:43:21.266 --> 00:43:23.805
[sighs]
I'm just following orders.

1019
00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:27.746
Kris Wheeler. you
are under arrest

1020
00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:29.717
for the murder
of Judge Jacob Brewer.

1021
00:43:29.817 --> 00:43:30.619
Okay. come on. Wa--
You gotta be kidding me.

1022
00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:32.455
You have the right
to remain silent.

1023
00:43:32.723 --> 00:43:35.127
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

1024
00:43:35.227 --> 00:43:36.197
You have the right
to consult an attorney.

1025
00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:38.601
-Let me see that.
-Yes. ma'am. It's all there.

1026
00:43:38.768 --> 00:43:41.273
[tense suspenseful music]

1027
00:43:41.273 --> 00:43:42.610
Sorry. Kris. It's legit.

1028
00:43:42.743 --> 00:43:44.647
Okay. all right.
this is ridiculous.

1029
00:43:44.847 --> 00:43:46.416
I didn't do it.

1030
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:46.484
I didn't do it.
Kimmie. Kimmie.
you gotta believe me.

1031
00:43:46.484 --> 00:43:48.020
Kimmie. Kimmie.
you gotta believe me.

1032
00:43:48.153 --> 00:43:49.723
-Don't talk to anyone.
-Okay. I got it.

1033
00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:51.493
I'll come see you
as soon as I can.

Hmm. nah.
I'll just get a burrito.

Well. if it isn't
the unsolicited solicitor.

00:44:17.411 --> 00:44:17.412
Well. if it isn't
the unsolicited solicitor.
Easy. Your Honor.

1041
00:44:17.412 --> 00:44:18.281
Easy. Your Honor.

1042
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.451
I am just a cog
in the wheel of justice.

1043
00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:20.552
I am just a cog
in the wheel of justice.
Oh. save me
the crappy metaphors. Ellis.

1044
00:44:20.552 --> 00:44:22.923
Oh. save me
the crappy metaphors. Ellis.

1045
00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:24.660
You haul my sister off to jail

1046
00:44:24.793 --> 00:44:26.631
and you don't even bother
to call me?

1047
00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:29.469
Sorry. we had to move fast.

1048
00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:29.504
Sorry. we had to move fast.
You even got a case. Ellis?

1049
00:44:29.504 --> 00:44:31.073
You even got a case. Ellis?

1050
00:44:31.172 --> 00:44:32.710
Perhaps you could stop by
my office later

1051
00:44:32.843 --> 00:44:34.914
-to discuss the matter.
-Oh. no.

1052
00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:36.785
We're gonna talk about it
right now.

1053
00:44:36.918 --> 00:44:38.988
-[clears throat]
-[inhaler whistles]

1054
00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:42.596
Okay. as you know.

1055
00:44:42.729 --> 00:44:45.068
Judge Brewer
died of heart attack.

1056
00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:47.807
but there was tissue damage
suggesting drug abuse.

1057
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.475
so a toxicology report
was ordered.

1058
00:44:49.475 --> 00:44:49.577
so a toxicology report
was ordered.
Now the report
found a massive amount

1059
00:44:49.577 --> 00:44:51.279
Now the report
found a massive amount

1060
00:44:51.279 --> 00:44:51.313
Now the report
found a massive amount
of Oxycontin in his system.

1061
00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:52.983
of Oxycontin in his system.

1062
00:44:53.116 --> 00:44:54.954
And that ties
to my sister how?

1063
00:44:55.054 --> 00:44:56.624
Well. she was the last one
to see him alive.

1064
00:44:56.757 --> 00:44:58.060
and Oxy was found
in her possession

1065
00:44:58.226 --> 00:44:59.731
during a recent investigation.

1066
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.968
so we believe
Ms. Wheeler provided the drugs

1067
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.006
-that led to the judge's demise.
-Drugs.

1068
00:45:04.105 --> 00:45:06.010
You mean
there was more than one?

1069
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:08.214
Rohypnol was also found
in the blood.

1070
00:45:08.347 --> 00:45:10.050
Well. that doesn't make
any sense.

1071
00:45:10.217 --> 00:45:12.455
Who parties on a date rape drug?

1072
00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:12.522
Who parties on a date rape drug?
Who knows
why people do anything?

1073
00:45:12.522 --> 00:45:14.694
Who knows
why people do anything?

1074
00:45:14.827 --> 00:45:16.496
I want a copy
of that M.E. report.

1075
00:45:16.764 --> 00:45:19.435
Your Honor. you have to get
discovery through council.

1076
00:45:19.435 --> 00:45:19.469
Your Honor. you have to get
discovery through council.
Now. if you'll excuse me.

1077
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:20.506
Now. if you'll excuse me.

1078
00:45:20.772 --> 00:45:23.511
I need to nourish myself
and I must get back to work.

1079
00:45:23.511 --> 00:45:23.512
I need to nourish myself
and I must get back to work.

1081
00:45:27.218 --> 00:45:30.825
What time can I see her?
What time's the arraignment?

1082
00:45:31.794 --> 00:45:34.365
Okay. thank you.

1083
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.771
-[button beeps]
-Bad news?

1084
00:45:36.837 --> 00:45:38.675
My sister's getting prepped
for her arraignment.

1085
00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:40.946
I can't see her till tomorrow.

1086
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:43.852
Oh. well. I thought
you would wanna know

1087
00:45:43.985 --> 00:45:45.589
I heard from Malcolm
in Carson City.

1088
00:45:45.822 --> 00:45:46.524
And?

1089
00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:46.624
And?
He said he can't divulge
the contents

1090
00:45:46.624 --> 00:45:48.260
He said he can't divulge
the contents

1091
00:45:48.393 --> 00:45:49.997
of Leo Stevenson's
sealed records.

1092
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.769
but he suggested
I look into the registry

1093
00:45:52.936 --> 00:45:56.010
of Spring Hill in 2008.

1094
00:45:56.142 --> 00:45:58.581
It sounded like
Leo was a patient there.

1095
00:45:59.349 --> 00:46:01.988
-You know Spring Hill?
-I do.

1096
00:46:02.054 --> 00:46:04.526
It's a treatment center
for male sex offenders.

1097
00:46:04.526 --> 00:46:04.560
It's a treatment center
for male sex offenders.

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.033
Mm-hmm.

1100
00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:10.004
Were you aware
that Leo Stevenson

1101
00:46:10.004 --> 00:46:13.444
was in the bathroom watching
the girls give their samples.

1102
00:46:13.477 --> 00:46:16.249
then threatening to fail them
if they don't go out with him?

1103
00:46:16.249 --> 00:46:17.185
No. I was not.

1104
00:46:17.284 --> 00:46:18.955
Are you telling me
there's no oversight

1105
00:46:19.088 --> 00:46:20.458
in this drug testing
program here?

1106
00:46:20.525 --> 00:46:22.796
Hey. I've only been
on Drug Court a couple of days.

1107
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.132
same as you.

1108
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.436
And you really think I'd cover
for that little weasel?

1109
00:46:26.436 --> 00:46:29.009
No. of course not. Okay.

1110
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.551
So. what about Leo?
Can we have him arrested?

1111
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.226
Not unless someone comes forward
with some real evidence.

1112
00:46:38.326 --> 00:46:41.166
There is one person.
but she doesn't wanna talk.

1113
00:46:42.068 --> 00:46:44.973
Yeah. look. I know these girls.

1114
00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:48.916
They're alone and afraid
and all they want

1115
00:46:49.048 --> 00:46:50.986
is to know that somebody
has their back.

1116
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.595
[chuckles] Yeah. I know
how they feel.

preying on vulnerable women.

And you can stop him
by just telling your story.

1121

You can take away
his power. Eileen.

1122

others will follow your lead.

Then ask one of them.

to do a very hard thing.

Let me just give you
a little personal experience.

1126
00:47:26.356 --> 00:47:29.228
If you stay quiet
and bury this deep down inside

1127
00:47:29.295 --> 00:47:33.137
and just go on with your life.
you'll never escape it.

1128
00:47:33.236 --> 00:47:36.309
Take this opportunity
and confront him.

1129
00:47:37.378 --> 00:47:40.718
If you don't. that opportunity
will go away

1130
00:47:41.987 --> 00:47:44.993
and all you'll be left with
is a whole lot of hurt.

And this is their chance.

I'm here to help you.

I can't go back to jail.

Let's start out with you
telling me everything you know

1153
00:48:41.574 --> 00:48:43.612
about the night
that Judge Brewer died.

1154
00:48:44.278 --> 00:48:47.619
Okay. um. well he. uh.

1155
00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:50.658
he showed up around nine.
you know. usual time.

1156
00:48:50.658 --> 00:48:50.725
he showed up around nine.
you know. usual time.
-So. he was a regular.
-Oh. yeah.

1157
00:48:50.725 --> 00:48:52.095
-So. he was a regular.
-Oh. yeah.

1158
00:48:52.261 --> 00:48:53.731
He shoulda had a punch card.

1159
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:53.798
He shoulda had a punch card.
Whenever he had court
in Tonopah.

1160
00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:55.535
Whenever he had court
in Tonopah.

1161
00:48:55.602 --> 00:48:58.140
he'd tell his wife
he was staying at the Mitzvah.

1162
00:48:58.173 --> 00:49:00.779
He'd make a big show about
having a few drinks at the bar.

1163
00:49:01.045 --> 00:49:04.252
and then he'd drive down
to The Lady and spend the night.

1164
00:49:04.686 --> 00:49:07.191
Mm-hmm. So. what happened
when he showed up?

1165
00:49:07.324 --> 00:49:09.462
Oh. he must have been drunk.

1166
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.434
Sadie went in to wake him up.
but he was passed out.

1167
00:49:12.569 --> 00:49:13.838
And he was dead
the next morning.

1168
00:49:14.071 --> 00:49:14.640
Yeah.

1169
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:14.673
Yeah.
You ever give him any drugs?

1170
00:49:14.673 --> 00:49:16.142
You ever give him any drugs?

1171
00:49:16.209 --> 00:49:21.053
Kim. we don't provide drugs
at The Lady. We're ladies.

1172
00:49:21.152 --> 00:49:23.892
If a guest brings their own.
that's on them.

1173
00:49:24.125 --> 00:49:26.965
Okay. so where did the Oxy
come from that the cops found?

1174
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.134
Dad's prescription.

1175
00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.170
-Oh.
-For his dementia.

1176
00:49:30.204 --> 00:49:34.078
I keep the bottle in my bag
so he doesn't accidentally OD.

1177
00:49:34.746 --> 00:49:36.618
Did Judge Brewer's
wife ever know

1178
00:49:36.684 --> 00:49:39.121
that he was catting around

00:57:26.188 --> 00:57:26.255
There you go. [laughing]
-This came for you.
-Who from?

1347
00:57:26.255 --> 00:57:27.792
-This came for you.
-Who from?

1348
00:57:27.925 --> 00:57:29.563
JO:
There's no return address.

1349
00:57:29.729 --> 00:57:31.633
Oh. well let's see.

1350
00:57:35.508 --> 00:57:37.277
-[Kim gasps]
-JO: Lord!

1351
00:57:37.512 --> 00:57:39.816
[gasping]

1352
00:57:41.152 --> 00:57:42.455
That's Daisy.

1353
00:57:42.588 --> 00:57:45.126
-You know this cat?
-KIM: Yes. I do.

1354
00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.168
Home is where the heart is.

1355
00:57:51.138 --> 00:57:53.610
Dad. Oh. my God. Dad.

1356
00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:56.583
[phone ringing]

1357
00:57:56.783 --> 00:57:58.153
What's the matter?

1358
00:57:58.252 --> 00:58:00.156
-The nurse is not picking up.
-[Jo gasping]

1359
00:58:03.262 --> 00:58:06.068
-[gentle suspenseful music]
-[birds chirping]

1360
00:58:06.068 --> 00:58:10.745
[♪♪♪♪♪]

1361
00:58:17.725 --> 00:58:18.927
Daddy!

1362
00:58:21.031 --> 00:58:24.204
VIRGIL:
Daisy. here. Daisy.

1363
00:58:24.204 --> 00:58:24.205
VIRGIL:
Daisy. here. Daisy.
[Kim sighs]

1364
00:58:24.205 --> 00:58:26.042
[Kim sighs]

1365
00:58:26.877 --> 00:58:28.947
We can't find Daisy.

1366
00:58:35.995 --> 00:58:37.532
[gentle melancholy music]

1367
00:58:37.632 --> 00:58:39.636
Wait. someone killed
your dad's cat?

1368
00:58:39.836 --> 00:58:40.805
That's serious.

1369
00:58:40.905 --> 00:58:42.074
Yeah. I think
they were trying to scare me.

1370
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.614
-throw me off my game.
-Yeah. but for what reason?

1371
00:58:45.714 --> 00:58:47.753
Well. maybe they don't want me
to find out

1372
00:58:47.919 --> 00:58:49.757
who really killed Judge Brewer.

1373
00:58:49.923 --> 00:58:51.526
Okay. and if you're wrong.

1374
00:58:51.626 --> 00:58:53.129
I mean. you're putting
your family at risk.

1375
00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.500
Okay. I was hoping that
you would talk to your friend

1376
00:58:55.601 --> 00:58:57.137
at the sheriff's department
and ask him

1377
00:58:57.204 --> 00:58:59.543
if he wouldn't mind keeping
an eye on my daddy's ranch.

1378
00:58:59.776 --> 00:59:00.645
Of course.

1379
00:59:00.778 --> 00:59:03.416
I don't want word
getting back to Kris.

1380
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:05.688
She's got enough to worry about.

1381
00:59:05.788 --> 00:59:08.126
VICKY:
Judge Brewer's wife's
been waiting.

1382
00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:14.037
Right. I'll go talk with her.
Is that his junk?

1383
00:59:14.773 --> 00:59:15.875
Yeah.

1384
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.983
[indistinct chatter]

1385
00:59:20.083 --> 00:59:22.588
-Wish me luck.
-You're gonna need it.

1386
00:59:22.822 --> 00:59:23.991
Thanks.

1387
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.370
-Ms. Brewer?
-Yes.

1388
00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:30.404
-Ms. Brewer?
-Yes.
I'm Kim Wheeler.
the new judge.

1389
00:59:30.404 --> 00:59:32.742
I'm Kim Wheeler.
the new judge.

1390
00:59:33.644 --> 00:59:34.746
Oh.

1391
00:59:34.813 --> 00:59:37.819
I understand your husband
was a kind man. well-liked.

1392
00:59:37.952 --> 00:59:41.726
[scoffs] For some.
These his things?

1393
00:59:41.827 --> 00:59:44.364
Yes. forgive me for being
indelicate. Ms. Brewer.

1394
00:59:44.364 --> 00:59:44.432
Yes. forgive me for being
indelicate. Ms. Brewer.
but were you aware
that your husband

1395
00:59:44.432 --> 00:59:46.235
but were you aware
that your husband

1396
00:59:46.235 --> 00:59:46.302
but were you aware
that your husband
liked to visit The Shady Lady?

1397
00:59:46.302 --> 00:59:48.172
liked to visit The Shady Lady?

1398
00:59:49.208 --> 00:59:50.779
With your tramp sister?

1399
00:59:50.878 --> 00:59:52.849
I know Kris didn't lead
a sacred life.

1400
00:59:52.982 --> 00:59:54.720
but she's no killer. Ms. Brewer.

1401
00:59:54.819 --> 00:59:56.255
There's no telling
what a piece of trash

1402
00:59:56.255 --> 00:59:56.289
There's no telling
what a piece of trash
like that is capable of.

1403
00:59:56.289 --> 00:59:57.559
like that is capable of.

1404
00:59:57.725 --> 00:59:59.896
I know my sister and she swears

1405
00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.901
she did not give your husband
any drugs.

1406
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.906
Oh. she would do anything
to destroy our love

1407
01:00:04.973 --> 01:00:07.712
-and ruin our marriage.
-What makes you say that?

1408
01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:13.591
Two years ago. I found out
Jacob was having an affair.

1409
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:15.561
He confessed
and was granted forgiveness

1410
01:00:15.728 --> 01:00:18.366
by the good Lord and myself.

1411
01:00:19.836 --> 01:00:20.771
Two weeks ago.

1412
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:23.209
I found this letter
in his jacket pocket.

1413
01:00:26.783 --> 01:00:28.219
An unsigned love letter?

1414
01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:31.994
From your sister
begging him to return.

1415
01:00:32.093 --> 01:00:35.300
and when he didn't.
she killed him. mm-hmm.

1416
01:00:36.068 --> 01:00:37.404
And there's the proof.

1417
01:00:39.007 --> 01:00:41.312
Have you shown this
to the sheriff?

1418
01:00:41.312 --> 01:00:41.346
Have you shown this
to the sheriff?
I. I meant to. uh...

1419
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.015
I. I meant to. uh...

1420
01:00:44.752 --> 01:00:47.191
some reason
I just couldn't part with it.

1421
01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:52.034
Maybe because both of us know
my sister didn't write this.

1422
01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:53.871
I'll make sure
the sheriff gets it.

1423
01:00:54.906 --> 01:01:00.183
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thanks for coming by.

1424
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:07.464
[tense suspenseful music]

1425
01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:07.532
[tense suspenseful music]
How did you know it was me?

1426
01:01:07.532 --> 01:01:09.301
How did you know it was me?

1427
01:01:10.905 --> 01:01:11.840
Your handwriting.

1428
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.612
I'd recognize
that fancy script anywhere.

1429
01:01:15.748 --> 01:01:18.921
I wrote that letter
after Jacob and I broke up.

1430
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:22.061
-How long were you two together?
-Two years.

1431
01:01:22.127 --> 01:01:25.066
But I was in love with him
for a decade before that.

1432
01:01:25.199 --> 01:01:27.203
And his wife never knew
it was you?

1433
01:01:27.203 --> 01:01:27.204
And his wife never knew
it was you?
Jacob protected me

1434
01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:28.807
Jacob protected me

1435
01:01:28.907 --> 01:01:31.111
even after Dottie asked him
to break it off.

1436
01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:37.490
Did you two ever engage
in any kind of games.

1437
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.559
Did you two ever engage
in any kind of games.
-use drugs. Rohypnol?
-No. never.

1438
01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:40.764
-use drugs. Rohypnol?
-No. never.

1439
01:01:42.434 --> 01:01:43.236
What'd you do
when you found out

1440
01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:45.473
that he was going
to The Shady Lady?

1441
01:01:45.473 --> 01:01:45.574
that he was going
to The Shady Lady?
I didn't know.
Not until after he died.

1442
01:01:45.574 --> 01:01:50.049
I didn't know.
Not until after he died.

1443
01:01:50.951 --> 01:01:52.822
Okay. let me get this straight.

1444
01:01:52.955 --> 01:01:54.893
He strung you along.
then dumped you

1445
01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:55.862
and went back to his wife.

1446
01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:58.834
and you begged
for another chance.

1447
01:01:58.934 --> 01:02:02.241
yet he would rather
hang out at a brothel?

1448
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.378
You must have been madder
than all get out.

1449
01:02:04.378 --> 01:02:06.148
Try heartbroken.

1450
01:02:07.017 --> 01:02:10.658
I loved Jake.
and I didn't kill him.

1451
01:02:10.858 --> 01:02:11.860
Then who did?

1452
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.632
[sobs] A lot of people
didn't like Jacob.

1453
01:02:14.766 --> 01:02:17.337
He got threats just like you.

1454
01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:20.878
Most of them were anonymous
and he never reported them.

1455
01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.086
He always said if someone
didn't want you dead.

1456
01:02:25.253 --> 01:02:26.489
then you weren't doing your job.

1457
01:02:26.523 --> 01:02:30.029
So. do you think he was killed
because of one of his cases?

1458
01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:33.169
I honestly don't know.

1459
01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:37.646
Please believe me. Judge.

1460
01:02:37.812 --> 01:02:42.087
[gentle suspenseful music]

1461
01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:47.131
KRIS:
Do you think this love letter
will help clear me?

1462
01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.770
Well. it's enough to bring up
reasonable doubt at trial.

1463
01:02:49.902 --> 01:02:52.074
but I doubt the DA'll
drop the charges.

1464
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.679
Glad you're both here.
Discovery came through.

1465
01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:56.082
-Did you get the autopsy report?
-Mm-hmm.

1466
01:02:56.115 --> 01:03:00.323
Forensic shows Judge Brewer died
from an overdose of Oxycontin.

1467
01:03:00.423 --> 01:03:02.795
Administered intravenously
under the Hallux nail.

1468
01:03:02.928 --> 01:03:03.964
-The what?
-The big toenail.

1469
01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:06.402
That's where they can hide
the injection mark.

1470
01:03:06.402 --> 01:03:06.435
That's where they can hide
the injection mark.
You mean like a junkie?

1471
01:03:06.435 --> 01:03:07.605
You mean like a junkie?

1472
01:03:07.838 --> 01:03:11.913
That explains the Rohypnol.
Judge Brewer's a big old boy.

1473
01:03:12.047 --> 01:03:13.316
For the killer to inject him.

1474
01:03:13.449 --> 01:03:15.053
he'd have to incapacitate
him first.

1475
01:03:15.219 --> 01:03:16.857
Meaning whoever did this

1476
01:03:16.956 --> 01:03:19.127
likely has experience
with IV drugs.

1477
01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:21.599
-KIM: Mm-hmm.
-Which I definitely do not.

1478
01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:21.634
-KIM: Mm-hmm.
-Which I definitely do not.
[notification dings]

1479
01:03:21.634 --> 01:03:23.202
[notification dings]

1480
01:03:24.605 --> 01:03:26.242
Crap. I gotta be somewhere.

1481
01:03:26.342 --> 01:03:28.312
-Check you later. thanks.
-KRIS: Yeah.

1482
01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:31.986
MELBA:
This is looking good.

1483
01:03:32.588 --> 01:03:36.428
[gentle upbeat music]

1484
01:03:39.067 --> 01:03:40.037
KIM:
So. you two make a deal?

1485
01:03:40.136 --> 01:03:42.173
[clears throat]
That's correct. your Honor.

1486
01:03:42.307 --> 01:03:45.213
-Okay. thank you so much.
-Welcome.

1487
01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:51.225
So. your client agrees
to these terms Mr. Goodlander?

1488
01:03:51.325 --> 01:03:55.500
Yes. Judge. The terms
are more than fair.

1489
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.570
Okie dokie.

1490
01:03:56.636 --> 01:03:59.842
I'll set sentencing tomorrow
1:00 p.m. in Tonopah.

1491
01:04:00.911 --> 01:04:02.849
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Judge.

1492
01:04:02.948 --> 01:04:05.854
-Ellis. you got a second?
-Uh. sure.

1493
01:04:07.023 --> 01:04:09.327
-[inhaler whistles]
-[clears throat]

1494
01:04:10.229 --> 01:04:11.566
So. according to forensics.

1495
01:04:11.566 --> 01:04:11.633
So. according to forensics.
the drug that
killed Judge Brewer

1496
01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:13.269
the drug that
killed Judge Brewer

1497
01:04:13.402 --> 01:04:15.373
was injected under the toenail.

1498
01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:19.048
So?

1499
01:04:19.114 --> 01:04:20.951
So. clearly the killer
was trying to hide it.

1500
01:04:21.085 --> 01:04:23.657
make it look like
a heart attack.

1501
01:04:23.924 --> 01:04:27.297
So. we're looking for someone
with IV drug experience.

1502
01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:30.537
It's a theory.
but like most theories.

1503
01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:32.842
it's long in imagination.
short in evidence.

1504
01:04:33.075 --> 01:04:34.880
[laughs]

1505
01:04:34.979 --> 01:04:36.916
It wasn't an accidental
overdose. Counselor.

1506
01:04:36.983 --> 01:04:39.522
It was premeditated.
You can't just ignore that.

1507
01:04:39.622 --> 01:04:41.593
Are you trying to bully me.
Judge Wheeler?

1508
01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:44.999
No. I'm trying to make you
do your job. Mr. Dinkins.

1509
01:04:46.536 --> 01:04:48.272
You have any idea why Goodlander

1510
01:04:48.372 --> 01:04:50.878
was so anxious to settle
the Crawford case?

1511
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:52.047
Why?

1512
01:04:52.147 --> 01:04:54.485
Because he's worried
you're a loose cannon

1513
01:04:54.585 --> 01:04:56.990
running around
in everyone's business.

1514
01:04:57.056 --> 01:04:59.529
He doesn't trust his case
with you on the bench.

1515
01:04:59.529 --> 01:04:59.562
He doesn't trust his case
with you on the bench.
That's a bunch of bull.

1516
01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.931
That's a bunch of bull.

1517
01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.537
He has a weak defense
and he knows it.

1518
01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.306
That may be.

1519
01:05:05.373 --> 01:05:07.845
but I'm gonna tell you
something for free.

1520
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.483
I'd be careful ruffling
too many feathers.

1521
01:05:12.053 --> 01:05:13.323
Is that a threat. Ellis?

1522
01:05:13.422 --> 01:05:16.028
'Cause that sounds
like a threat to me.

1523
01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:18.901
It's just a friendly
warning. Judge.

Hey. I need you to go
through
the Drug Court records.

1528
01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.836
compile me a list of
all the IV drug users

1529
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.308
and then crosscheck that list

1530
01:05:39.374 --> 01:05:41.914
to see if any of them
are still living in the area.

1531
01:05:42.046 --> 01:05:43.116
How far do you want me
to go back?

1532
01:05:43.182 --> 01:05:46.121
As far as you can.
I know it's gonna take a while.

1533

So. you really think
Brewer's killer

1536
01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:52.635
came through Drug Court?

1537
01:05:52.701 --> 01:05:55.941
Well. it's a lead we definitely
need to check out.

1538
01:05:56.041 --> 01:05:58.245
If Dinkins won't do it.
that leaves us.

Mm-hmm.

1540
01:06:04.692 --> 01:06:06.930
Would you say
I'm a loose cannon?

1541
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.971
No. no. no.

1542
01:06:12.675 --> 01:06:14.679
At least not to your face.

I'm not finished.

1560
01:06:56.663 --> 01:07:00.370
Mr. Crawford. it's clear to me
that you have issues with anger.

1561
01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:04.044
so I hereby order to you
to complete 52 hours

1562
01:07:04.144 --> 01:07:08.720
of anger management classes
at your own expense.

1563

you will appear before me

1564
01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:12.595
to explain what you've learned

1565
01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:17.470
and why something like this
will never. ever happen again.

1566
01:07:18.807 --> 01:07:21.813
We'll all make mistakes.
Mr. Crawford.

Mr. Crawford.
but yours cost
a young man his life.

someone who by all accounts
was a close friend.

will never get to enjoy

the opportunities
that you so easily disdain.

1572

That young man
will never have the chance

1573
01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:39.715
That young man
will never have the chance
to fulfill his promise.

Do your time. Mr. Crawford.
Make amends.

Okay. there's a big difference
between passing sentence

Howdy. judge.
A little early. ain't it?

1677
01:12:08.118 --> 01:12:08.186
Howdy. judge.
A little early. ain't it?
-Oh. a little bit.
-What can I get you?

1678
01:12:08.186 --> 01:12:09.923
-Oh. a little bit.
-What can I get you?

1679
01:12:10.022 --> 01:12:12.695
How about a diet soda.
please? Thanks.

1680
01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.667
Oh. and thanks
for helping me out yesterday.

1681
01:12:16.836 --> 01:12:19.609
Ms. Crawford's been going
through a tough time lately.

1682
01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.412
I hope you didn't take
what she said personal.

1683
01:12:21.612 --> 01:12:23.282
Seriously?

1684
01:12:23.415 --> 01:12:24.586
How can you defend
her the way

1685
01:12:24.718 --> 01:12:26.756
-she was treating you?
-VANCE: Well...

1686
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:32.133
Okay. nevermind.
Water under the bridge. right?

1687
01:12:32.133 --> 01:12:32.200
Okay. nevermind.
Water under the bridge. right?
But I do need to ask a favor.

1688
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.806
But I do need to ask a favor.

1689
01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.877
I need to look
at the hotel security footage

1690
01:12:37.009 --> 01:12:39.380
from the night
that Judge Brewer died.

1691
01:12:40.449 --> 01:12:42.387
-Can I ask why?
-Well. don't know for sure.

1692
01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:43.690
but I think
it could be something

1693
01:12:43.856 --> 01:12:45.092
really important on it.

1694
01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.598
Well. we only keep a week

1695
01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:48.465
-on the server.
-KIM: Mm-hmm.

1696
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.936
-Old stuff gets archived.
-Yeah.

1697
01:12:49.969 --> 01:12:53.743
And we just moved our records
to an old barn outside of town.

1698
01:12:54.612 --> 01:12:55.848
I suppose
I could run you up there

1699
01:12:55.947 --> 01:12:58.118
-if it's that important.
-It is. it really is.

1700
01:12:58.118 --> 01:12:58.119
-if it's that important.
-It is. it really is.
Thanks a bunch.

1701
01:12:58.119 --> 01:12:59.388
Thanks a bunch.

1702
01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:01.224
Then I'll make
that soda to go.

1703
01:13:01.424 --> 01:13:02.493
Thanks. Vance.

Hey. Eileen. You're up early.

1706
01:13:08.105 --> 01:13:10.476
I just emailed the judge
a list of IV drug users

1707
01:13:10.644 --> 01:13:11.880
who went through the program.

1708
01:13:11.912 --> 01:13:13.917
Wanted to make sure she got it.
but she didn't answer her phone.

1709
01:13:14.017 --> 01:13:16.421
VICKY:
I think she's gone off
somewhere.

1710
01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:17.825
Her truck ain't here.
but I can give it to her.

1711
01:13:17.924 --> 01:13:19.962
Okay. by the way.
the only one I could find

1712
01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.968
still in the area was a man
named Vance. Vance White.

1713
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:25.540
It wasn't Bart.

1714
01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:28.646
-Okay. thanks Eileen.

Well. I'm not sure exactly.

1732
01:14:13.936 --> 01:14:16.576
But you think the killer
could be on there.

1733
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:18.613
Well. now that
you mention it. uh.

1734
01:14:18.713 --> 01:14:22.854
whoever killed Judge Brewer
drugged him first.

1735
01:14:22.988 --> 01:14:25.125
and he. uh. always
had a few drinks

1736
01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:25.159
and he. uh. always
had a few drinks
at the Mitzvah bar

1737
01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:26.095
at the Mitzvah bar

1738
01:14:26.194 --> 01:14:28.131
before he headed on
down to The Shady Lady.

1739
01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:31.572
[laughs] Give. give me.
give me one to go.

-Fill her up--
-Sure thing.

1741
01:14:32.574 --> 01:14:35.346
And fill her up
this time. okay?

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:38.085
Yeah. that's better. yeah.

1745
01:14:42.627 --> 01:14:45.466
So. you drugged my soda
with Rohypnol

1746
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.236
just like you drugged his flask.

1747

Take the next left.

1751
01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:04.303
I think Judge Wheeler's
in trouble. Hold on.

1752
01:15:04.303 --> 01:15:04.404
I think Judge Wheeler's
in trouble. Hold on.
I think Vance
killed Judge Brewer.

1753
01:15:04.404 --> 01:15:05.741
I think Vance
killed Judge Brewer.

1754
01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:06.776
-What?
-And I'm pretty sure him

1755
01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:08.647
and Kim just drove off
to God knows where.

1756
01:15:08.746 --> 01:15:10.951
-In what car?
-Her truck. It ain't here.

1757
01:15:11.084 --> 01:15:12.988
I think I can find him.
Come on.

1758
01:15:13.656 --> 01:15:16.127
So. after you drugged the judge.

1759
01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:18.265
you followed him on
down to The Shady Lady

1760
01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:18.331
you followed him on
down to The Shady Lady
-and injected him.
-Keep driving.

1761
01:15:18.331 --> 01:15:21.071
-and injected him.
-Keep driving.

1762
01:15:21.137 --> 01:15:25.245
So. those were your taillights
at my daddy's ranch.

1763
01:15:26.749 --> 01:15:29.320
Broke into my truck.
killed my daddy's cat.

1764
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:34.464
trying to scare me off.
maybe force a mistrial.

1765
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.769
But why kill Judge Brewer?

1766
01:15:37.637 --> 01:15:39.675
-Did Bart pay you off?
-Are you kidding?

1767
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:43.649
Bart doesn't even have the balls
to protect his own family.

1768
01:15:45.319 --> 01:15:47.925
Wait. this is about Charlene.

1769
01:15:48.058 --> 01:15:50.396
Oh. that's why you
intervened yesterday

1770
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:54.404
and was taking up for her being
so protective and so strong.

1771
01:15:54.571 --> 01:15:56.107
You're in love with her.

1772
01:15:57.143 --> 01:15:58.746
She's an amazing woman.

1773
01:15:59.213 --> 01:16:01.017
You guys having an affair?

1774
01:16:01.151 --> 01:16:03.021
No. That's none
of your business.

1775
01:16:03.088 --> 01:16:06.963
So. she's the one that
wanted Judge Brewer dead.

1776
01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:10.335
Her son was being railroaded
by a corrupted system.

1777
01:16:11.204 --> 01:16:13.676
Those your words or hers?

1778
01:16:16.014 --> 01:16:18.953
Vance. Charlene's
the type of woman

1779
01:16:19.086 --> 01:16:21.659
who knows how to get
what she wants.

1780
01:16:22.961 --> 01:16:26.001
She was just using you
to do her dirty work.

1781
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.140
Oh no. no.
it's not like that. all right?

1782
01:16:30.844 --> 01:16:32.748
We're in love. we're.
we're gonna be together.

1783
01:16:32.914 --> 01:16:34.852
See. that's why she wanted

1784
01:16:34.985 --> 01:16:37.122
to keep y'all's relationship
a secret.

1785
01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:39.127
Five miles south on 95.

1786
01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.298
Go east about a mile
or two. okay? And hurry.

1787
01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.536
Don't you worry. Vicky.
Wayne's on the way.

1788
01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:45.339
Vance. it's not too late.

1789
01:16:46.374 --> 01:16:48.713
If you confess
and agree to testifying

1790
01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.249
-against Charlene--
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1791
01:16:51.151 --> 01:16:53.723
Because coercion
is against the law.

1792
01:16:53.856 --> 01:16:55.928
and if you say
Charlene coerced you

1793
01:16:56.094 --> 01:16:59.034
into killing Judge Brewer.

1794
01:16:59.133 --> 01:17:02.774
then I can get them
to lessen the sentence.

1795
01:17:03.976 --> 01:17:05.145
Maybe.

1796
01:17:06.047 --> 01:17:07.416
Or I could bury you
in the desert

1797
01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:07.450
Or I could bury you
in the desert
and get on with my life.

a paramedic team down here

right quick as you can?

1845
01:19:17.877 --> 01:19:19.380
Came back with bourbon
and you were gone.

1846
01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.219
Oh. sorry about that.
How'd you find me?

1847
01:19:22.319 --> 01:19:24.558
I put a GPS tracker
on your bumper.

I put a GPS tracker
on your bumper.
Well that explains
what you was doing

1849
01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:25.960
Well that explains
what you was doing

1850
01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.496
in the parking lot
the other night.

1851
01:19:27.564 --> 01:19:30.369
Well. I was worried
whoever killed Judge Brewer

1852
01:19:31.437 --> 01:19:32.172
might go after you.

1853
01:19:32.272 --> 01:19:34.244
so I decided to
keep tabs on you.

1854
01:19:34.343 --> 01:19:36.481
Well. I don't like it.
but I'm glad you did it.

More than anything.
I'm glad you're not a killer.

Hold on. speaking of which.

1857
01:19:40.556 --> 01:19:40.657
Hold on. speaking of which.
why would Vance
wanna kill Judge Brewer?

wanna kill Judge Brewer?

1859
01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.464
