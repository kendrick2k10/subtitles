00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:53.625
Mark. honey. you've got to
stop leaving the door open!

4
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.375
Mark!

5
00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:04.833
Mark!

6
00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:27.667
Mark!

7
00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:33.833
Mark!

8
00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:40.583
Mark?

9
00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:41.667
Mark?

10
00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:49.667
Daddy?

11
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.583
Mark?

12
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.958
It got out.

13
00:03:58.833 --> 00:03:59.790
Seriously. Mark.
this better be good.

14
00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:01.667
'cause I am not in the
mood today. noway I-

15
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.833
- Daddy. she went in there.
even though you said not to.

16
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.542
No. she wouldn't go in
there. she knows better.

17
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.833
Daddy. she did. I saw her.

18
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.000
Christine?

19
00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.748
Stay back. buddy. all right.
just stay here for me. okay?

20
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.831
Okay.

21
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:26.915
I need you to be really.
really brave now. okay

22
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:28.581
and be quiet.

23
00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.748
Listen. whatever you hear.
just don't move. shh. okay.

24
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.833
just stay there. okay?

25
00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.042
Christine?

26
00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:03.292
Christine!

27
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:05.792
This isn't funny anymore.

28
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:23.792
Oh. no. no. no.

29
00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:28.917
Run. go!

30
00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.081
Come on. give me your
hand. give me your hand!

31
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.206
What is it?

32
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:35.748
Look. there's no time to
explain. come on. honey.

33
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.748
come on. come on.

34
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.083
Go. go. go. come on. that's it.

35
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.873
Get in the car.
Mark. now. get in!

36
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:59.706
That's it. buddy. everything's
gonna be fine. okay.

37
00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.415
be brave for daddy. be
really. really brave.

38
00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:04.206
That's it. everything's
gonna be fine.

39
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.042
nothing's gonna happen
to you. okay. honestly.

40
00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:27.081
Close your eyes. Mark.
close your eyes buddy. okay.

41
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:28.958
cover your eyes. don't look.

42
00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958
Close your eyes.

43
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.000
Daddy!

44
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.167
No!

45
00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:16.833
Fuck.

46
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:21.083
What?

47
00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:23.708
Simon.

48
00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:30.290
Still no word?

49
00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.331
It's just not like him.
he's not even responding

50
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.040
to my text.

51
00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:36.873
Well. when was the last
time you heard from him?

52
00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:37.875
A week ago.

53
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.915
I just wanna make sure he's
okay before this weekend.

54
00:07:41.917 --> 00:07:44.125
Yeah. well. why
wouldn't he be?

55
00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:52.873
After what happened to Mark.
he's just been so distant

56
00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.748
with us and Mom and Dad.

57
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.206
It doesn't matter
how much we help him.

58
00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:00.540
Ah. don't worry. it's fine.
you'll see him tomorrow.

59
00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.290
Do you not remember the
last time Simon and Dad

60
00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:03.792
were in a room together?

61
00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:07.331
Are you sure you won't come?

62
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:10.956
No. I hate these
pathetic family gatherings.

63
00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.792
I know. I could
really use you.

64
00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:17.248
You know. I've got
a party at Cassie's.

65
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.917
it's been planned for months.

66
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.833
- Fine.
- Fine.

67
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.248
Will you stop looking
at me like that.

68
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.083
Like what?

69
00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:34.581
Okay. fine. I'll come.

70
00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:38.540
But on two conditions.

71
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:42.373
- Hmm?
- The first. I get

72
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.040
to go in the front
the whole time.

73
00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:46.331
Okay.

74
00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:51.333
And you have to do my laundry.

75
00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.000
Fine. whatever.

76
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:01.333
All right.

77
00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:06.875
Oh. yeah. thanks love.

78
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.373
Why am I the one
sitting in the back?

79
00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.792
Because I'm the one
sitting in the front.

80
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.998
Don't make a scene.
Bernie. it's only two hours.

81
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.331
You should.

82
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:21.998
I don't know why we're
even bothering with Simon

83
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.958
and this trip anyway.

84
00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.123
He should make the effort
to come and visit us

85
00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:27.040
every once in awhile.

86
00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.123
so we don't have to trek
up there every year.

87
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:31.331
Dad. please. this
is the only time

88
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:32.998
we all get to spend together

89
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.165
and after what
happened with Mark.

90
00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:35.875
we need to be there for him.

91
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:39.998
That was over a year ago. now.

92
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.956
I think you'll find we did try

93
00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.248
to support him and
Christine when it happened

94
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.623
but they didn't want us there.

95
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:46.498
Every year it's the same thing

96
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.706
we go all the way
up there to see him

97
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:52.165
and then Christine gets him
to kick us out a day early.

98
00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.998
Well. I'll tell you what.
this is the last year.

99
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.915
Oh. Dad. just shut up.

100
00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:58.040
You apologize to your father.

101
00:09:58.042 --> 00:10:02.373
No. Mom. he can't keep
treating Simon like an outcast.

102
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:04.165
Dad. if you wanna
be in our lives.

103
00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:05.583
you've gotta make an effort.

104
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:10.415
Okay. let's be quiet
for the journey.

105
00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:12.292
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

106
00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:45.123
Typical Simon.
leaving himself open

107
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.333
to all kinds of robbery.

108
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.206
Dad. nobody knows
this place exists.

109
00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.456
there's no one around
here for miles.

110
00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:53.500
I don't like this.

111
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.208
Something doesn't feel right.

112
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.290
No. no. Dad. you and
Mom stay in the car.

113
00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:07.540
I've been sitting
here for hours.

114
00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.248
I need to stretch my legs.

115
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.167
Fine. just stay by the car.

116
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:16.208
You coming?

117
00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:19.500
Okay.

118
00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.250
It's quiet.

119
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:47.290
Don't freak out. it was
probably just an accident.

120
00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:48.292
What do you mean?

121
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:58.206
This is exactly what I'm
talking about. takes after you.

122
00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:03.083
Bern. can we please just
have a couple of days of peace?

123
00:14:55.458 --> 00:14:56.373
Anybody home!

124
00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:58.706
Jesus. Cate. Christ
a little head's up

125
00:14:58.708 --> 00:14:59.667
would have been nice.

126
00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:03.373
Yeah but if someone's
here that shouldn't be.

127
00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:04.667
I wanna know now.

128
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:58.542
You still think
everything's all right?

129
00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.458
Is it dead?

130
00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:16.667
I have my phone.

131
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.417
What could have happened?

132
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.790
I don't know but
let's get out of here

133
00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:25.958
and call by the car.

134
00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.623
Oh. Jesus Christ. Dad.

135
00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:33.498
I said to wait by the car.

136
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.958
What the hell happened here?

137
00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:37.625
- Where's Simon?
- We don't know.

138
00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:44.415
It looks like something
bad happened here.

139
00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:45.748
Where's Mom?

140
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.333
She's waiting in the car.

141
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.375
Hello?

142
00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:08.000
Simon?

143
00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:13.042
Simon?

144
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.625
What could he be doing?

145
00:18:57.083 --> 00:18:58.542
I think we need to leave.

146
00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:08.542
Auntie Jocelyn?

147
00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:21.167
It can't be.

148
00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:52.125
Auntie. why are you crying?

149
00:20:15.542 --> 00:20:17.956
I feel like I'm
seeing a ghost.

150
00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.625
What's happening?

151
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.458
Where's Daddy. Mark?

152
00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:25.625
It got Daddy.

153
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:29.873
What do you mean?

154
00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:32.792
The monster. it
took Daddy away.

155
00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:17.708
Ow.

156
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.250
Christine. no.

157
00:21:44.042 --> 00:21:44.958
Rebecca.

158
00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.040
Mom?

159
00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:06.083
She's dead. she's dead. she's.

160
00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:12.750
Mom. don't move.

161
00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:36.750
Don't move.

162
00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:44.748
Bern!

163
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.040
Mom!

164
00:23:00.042 --> 00:23:01.333
No. no. no. no!

165
00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:33.833
We just gotta focus on
getting out of here. okay?

166
00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:49.667
Jos. stop staring.

167
00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.750
What was it. a dinosaur?

168
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:05.167
How is that even possible?

169
00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:15.417
Jos. how can he be alive.

170
00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:19.375
did Simon tell you
anything about it?

171
00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:25.081
No. maybe Simon lied.

172
00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:30.083
No. I attended his funeral.
we all did. Mark was dead.

173
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:32.083
I don't understand
any of this.

174
00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:36.083
You shouldn't
watch out the window.

175
00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:40.708
If they see you. they'll
come back in here.

176
00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:43.083
How many are there. Marky?

177
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.958
Three. two small. one big.

178
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.500
How long have you been here?

179
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.750
Cate. where's your phone?

180
00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:07.500
You had it downstairs.

181
00:25:08.417 --> 00:25:09.500
Could you go get it?

182
00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:13.000
Okay.

183
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.125
Call the cops. we're
not safe to sit here.

184
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.792
What happened to
Mom and Dad. Mark?

185
00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:38.833
The monsters got them.

186
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:46.875
That's Dad's computer.

187
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:58.290
Why are you trying
to figure out here Jos?

188
00:25:58.292 --> 00:26:00.542
I need to know what's
going on. don't you?

189
00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:03.123
Seeing as how we can't ask them.

190
00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:05.125
we can figure it out ourselves.

191
00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:09.040
So. Mark. this is where
Daddy did his work?

192
00:26:09.042 --> 00:26:10.208
Yeah. on there.

193
00:26:12.583 --> 00:26:14.498
I don't know what
I'm looking for.

194
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.833
Maybe this.

195
00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:20.083
What is that?

196
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.083
Daddy's work diary.

197
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:41.665
999 operator.

198
00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:43.581
Hi. we need your help.

199
00:26:43.583 --> 00:26:45.081
What
is your emergency?

200
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:47.833
Oh. you're not
gonna believe me.

201
00:26:56.542 --> 00:26:59.373
Some of what I'm about
to say may seem far fetched

202
00:26:59.375 --> 00:27:01.542
but I can assure
you it's all true.

203
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:04.125
as close to the
truth as I can see.

204
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:31.167
My name is Dr. Simon Dade.

205
00:27:32.708 --> 00:27:35.665
My vocation has
brought me to this farm

206
00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:38.040
where my experiments are
kept away from prying eyes

207
00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:40.583
and all collateral damage
is kept to a minimum.

208
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.623
I have gone to great
lengths to isolate myself

209
00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:45.998
from the bustle of city life.

210
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.290
And I decided to
put as much distance

211
00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:49.206
between my family and me.

212
00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.165
Our nearest neighbors is
drive away

213
00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:54.083
which suits myself. my
wife and our son just fine.

214
00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:03.042
What were you doing. Simon?

215
00:28:04.292 --> 00:28:08.375
The idea started
when Mark passed away.

216
00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:14.125
I couldn't lose him.

217
00:28:15.292 --> 00:28:19.456
I had to think of something.
I couldn't just let him go.

218
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:33.083
I found a way to bring him back.

219
00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:40.208
Oh come on. come on.
come on. come on.

220
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.498
By using the DNA cells
of someone alive or dead.

221
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.831
I could manipulate the
growth rate of those cells

222
00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:19.000
to synthetic breed a
human in my laboratory.

223
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.000
It could be possible.

224
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.167
to bring Mark back.

225
00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:38.417
I had nothing to risk
and everything to gain.

226
00:30:28.292 --> 00:30:31.417
Day 12. yeah. okay.
so far my attempts

227
00:30:32.917 --> 00:30:35.540
to manipulate the expansion
of the DNA samples

228
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:40.458
are acquired prove to
be rather fruitless.

229
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.333
However. we will persevere.

230
00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:56.331
Using alternative gene
therapy techniques.

231
00:30:56.333 --> 00:31:00.290
some biotechnology methods.
I was able to produce enzymes

232
00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:04.208
and proteins identical to
human DNA to Mark's DNA.

233
00:31:14.542 --> 00:31:18.623
Maybe I could find someway to
genetically modify that DNA.

234
00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:21.331
manipulating human
tissues. blood cells

235
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:23.792
to rid Mark of his disease
once he returned to us.

236
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:34.333
He did this.

237
00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:37.831
Simon. he brought Mark back

238
00:31:37.833 --> 00:31:41.833
and then he brought
the dinosaurs back.

239
00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:04.250
Christine. honey. wake
up. I've got someone here

240
00:32:06.917 --> 00:32:08.458
who wants to say hello to you.

241
00:32:15.917 --> 00:32:18.373
There. there.

242
00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:21.290
The idea came when some
fossils are shipped to me

243
00:32:21.292 --> 00:32:23.540
from an excavation rig in
Argentina. South America.

244
00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:27.290
The laboratory claimed
that there was evidence

245
00:32:27.292 --> 00:32:29.873
of dinosaur remains
within the rocks.

246
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:30.958
They wanted me to study it.

247
00:32:32.542 --> 00:32:34.623
Through advanced technologies
I've been working with.

248
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:37.331
I was able to successfully
extract dead cells

249
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:38.833
from the fossils they sent me.

250
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.040
Christine. baby. you will
not believe your eyes.

251
00:32:42.042 --> 00:32:43.873
I need you to follow me
into the shed right now.

252
00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:45.540
Don't laugh. come.
I'm being serious.

253
00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:47.040
come on. let's go. quickly.

254
00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:48.873
Please. it's gonna blow your
mind. come on. this way.

255
00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:51.040
Come on. that's it.

256
00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:53.331
I thought it would
be easy to control.

257
00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:56.415
I could have given life
not only to my son again.

258
00:32:56.417 --> 00:33:00.542
but I could life
to the dinosaurs.

259
00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:03.417
Man's biggest accomplishment.

260
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:06.581
All I'd have to do is
appease their appetite

261
00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:07.917
and keep them contained.

262
00:33:09.042 --> 00:33:10.458
And that would be
the hardest part.

263
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.706
What is it?

264
00:33:12.708 --> 00:33:15.667
It's a dinosaur.

265
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:22.623
Whoa. whoa. it's okay.
shh. it's all right.

266
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:24.375
Don't make any sudden movements.

267
00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:34.415
Oh my god.

268
00:33:40.583 --> 00:33:41.458
Hey. little guy.

269
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.456
It's wonderful.

270
00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:46.958
I didn't expect
them to grow at such a rate.

271
00:33:48.458 --> 00:33:51.331
Mark had grown in years
within just a few months.

272
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:53.498
I suspected as a reaction
to the genetic modification.

273
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.417
an oversight on my part.

274
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.956
But I knew my time with
him would be limited.

275
00:33:58.958 --> 00:34:01.373
So. I had to figure out a
way to slow that growth down

276
00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:03.498
and reverse this. so
I could slow his down

277
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.625
and keep him for longer.

278
00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:13.123
At first it was easy.
because of it's size.

279
00:34:13.125 --> 00:34:15.748
I could feed it small
rodents and rabbits I caught

280
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.708
out in the wild.

281
00:34:17.833 --> 00:34:20.623
But it was growing very
quickly. just like Mark had

282
00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:24.292
and pretty soon it
wanted bigger prey.

283
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.373
Let's go.

284
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:34.790
But if I could just
get it to listen to me.

285
00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:38.540
obey instructions then maybe
I could control it's emotions

286
00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:39.500
when it got bigger.

287
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:55.665
It's a big one this time.

288
00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:57.706
I'd explained it
all to Christine.

289
00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:00.373
she would have agreed to
anything to keep Mark.

290
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:02.456
She let me continue my
experiments in the shed

291
00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:04.456
and she promised me she
would never go in there.

292
00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:05.333
Easy.

293
00:35:08.208 --> 00:35:09.748
Mom. what was that?

294
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.206
We agreed
never to tell Mark.

295
00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:15.498
As far as he was concerned.
the shed was off limits.

296
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.456
It's okay. honey. okay.
don't worry about it.

297
00:35:19.458 --> 00:35:20.165
Let's go inside.

298
00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:21.042
Okay.

299
00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:27.458
I knew it was risky
but I was on to something.

300
00:35:28.583 --> 00:35:30.375
something I just
couldn't let go.

301
00:35:39.208 --> 00:35:42.040
Dispatching
now. stay inside the house.

302
00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:42.581
do not leave.

303
00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:45.206
Oh. okay. thank you.

304
00:35:45.208 --> 00:35:46.206
Estimated arrival is

305
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:48.375
in the next 10 to 20 minutes.

306
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.167
Okay. bye.

307
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.750
- Jocelyn!
- Caitlyn.

308
00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:19.623
Run!

309
00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:24.248
Open the door. open the door!

310
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.125
Come on.

311
00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:43.792
Open door.

312
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.706
We need to get
out of here now.

313
00:39:47.708 --> 00:39:50.040
What if there are
more of those things.

314
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:53.792
Well. he said. Mark
said there were three.

315
00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:59.998
So. we go by his word.
T-Rex and the two raptors.

316
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.373
How are we gonna
get out of here?

317
00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:04.373
Do you think Caitlyn
and Mark are okay?

318
00:40:22.708 --> 00:40:23.417
Auntie Jocelyn?

319
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.333
Auntie Caitlyn?

320
00:40:41.083 --> 00:40:42.750
Mark. come down.

321
00:40:50.875 --> 00:40:52.373
Oh crap.

322
00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:53.083
Let's go.

323
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.415
Get back!

324
00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:09.333
Get back!

325
00:41:11.542 --> 00:41:12.417
Get back!

326
00:41:24.417 --> 00:41:26.417
Someone wanna tell me
what's going on here?

327
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:45.333
What's that?

328
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.417
Whatever it is that's
out there. it's big.

329
00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:53.833
Let's keep
moving. go. go.

330
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.375
Doctor. what are you thinking?

331
00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:17.375
I need some more time with
this. there's a lot to take in.

332
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.125
Ladies. I am
Sergeant Fletcher.

333
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:26.540
would you mind if
myself and Private Ryan

334
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:28.958
take you back to the house
for some questioning?

335
00:42:29.958 --> 00:42:30.833
Of course.

336
00:42:31.792 --> 00:42:36.958
Corporal. I believe
you were the scientist.

337
00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:39.956
focus on discovering what it is

338
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.375
we're dealing with out there.

339
00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:43.833
Yes. Sergeant.

340
00:42:54.167 --> 00:42:56.498
If it is what they say.
we're gonna need a lot more

341
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.917
than a few guns. I can
tell you that much.

342
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Thank you.

343
00:43:12.167 --> 00:43:16.000
You done 'cause if you are.
we're sitting ducks here.

344
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.998
This could well be
a state of emergency

345
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.167
if we don't act fast.

346
00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:26.998
Whatever the hell that
thing is out there.

347
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.206
we need to know exactly
what we are dealing with.

348
00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:32.165
We are not in a position
to send you on your way

349
00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:34.167
without the facts of
what happened here.

350
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.706
We need to avoid at
all costs that thing

351
00:43:37.708 --> 00:43:39.956
getting to the city.

352
00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:42.081
My brother. there's
a journal upstairs

353
00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:43.458
documenting his findings.

354
00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:47.331
I think that's why he
chose this location.

355
00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:52.248
so far from the public.
in case it escaped.

356
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.206
at lease he could contain it.

357
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:56.206
Where is this journal?

358
00:43:56.208 --> 00:43:57.083
Upstairs study.

359
00:43:58.292 --> 00:43:59.915
Private. would you mind?

360
00:43:59.917 --> 00:44:00.583
Yes. sarge.

361
00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:08.250
Hey there. young man.

362
00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:14.123
Now I need you to tell me
exactly what you know. okay

363
00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:18.917
about what your dad was
doing out there in his shed.

364
00:44:20.125 --> 00:44:25.125
Dad. he was able
to make them nice.

365
00:44:26.583 --> 00:44:29.081
He said they'd never hurt us
but once the big one escaped.

366
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.125
they all changed.

367
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:36.248
When you say the big one.

368
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:41.250
do you mean the T-Rex escaped?

369
00:44:42.583 --> 00:44:46.581
It was smaller. like
the others at first

370
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:49.083
but it grew really quickly.

371
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.331
This is not safe for
my family. sergeant.

372
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:54.248
I understand you wanna
find out what happened here

373
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.706
but this is all we know.

374
00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:57.623
It's not safe here.

375
00:44:57.625 --> 00:44:59.998
That thing could
be back any second.

376
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.081
My men have guns. we
are well protected here.

377
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:04.123
And you're gonna need
more than that to stop it.

378
00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:05.706
You didn't see what we saw.

379
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:08.706
The lives of the
masses mean more to me

380
00:45:08.708 --> 00:45:10.790
than the lives of a handful.

381
00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:13.500
You understand me.
sir. now sit down.

382
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.290
The quicker we can figure
out what happened here.

383
00:45:17.292 --> 00:45:19.623
the quicker I will
have you on your way.

384
00:45:19.625 --> 00:45:20.958
You have my word.

385
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:23.000
Now sit.

386
00:45:33.833 --> 00:45:37.000
Nick. Drake. I need
to send you off.

387
00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:39.748
Search the surrounding
perimeter of the woodland.

388
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.748
keep out for any movement.

389
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.040
We need to keep this
thing contained.

390
00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:48.290
so it doesn't wander into
an of the surrounding areas.

391
00:45:48.292 --> 00:45:50.542
Guard the border whilst
we wait for backup.

392
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:55.000
Oh and men. do not
hesitate to fire at will.

393
00:45:56.167 --> 00:45:58.165
Regardless of what
the sergeant wants.

394
00:45:58.167 --> 00:46:00.706
you're safety comes
first. understood?

395
00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:02.708
Yes. Corporal Fox. sir.

396
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:10.583
Please. I'm going
as fast as I can.

397
00:46:20.625 --> 00:46:23.331
Don't let the fear
get to your head.

398
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:27.375
This up here. use it to
your advantage. okay?

399
00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:34.083
Come on. I go
south. you go north.

400
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:38.083
Don't go out too far.

401
00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:39.750
Sure.

402
00:47:03.417 --> 00:47:05.123
We've gotta leave.
shit's just screwed up.

403
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:06.915
Dad's upstairs.
we can't leave him.

404
00:47:06.917 --> 00:47:09.915
They just pointed
a gun at our heads.

405
00:47:09.917 --> 00:47:11.331
We get them the
information they want

406
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:12.250
and then we can go.

407
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.750
Hey. Mark. come on. it's okay.

408
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.248
I don't mean to cry.
but I just feel so sad

409
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.375
inside my stomach.

410
00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:40.750
You're not alone
anymore. we're here now.

411
00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:44.292
I just really
miss my mom and dad.

412
00:47:46.542 --> 00:47:48.792
I know. I miss them too.

413
00:47:50.792 --> 00:47:53.125
How long have you been
here for on your own?

414
00:47:54.167 --> 00:47:55.956
I really don't know.

415
00:47:55.958 --> 00:47:58.331
So. you haven't had a
proper meal or anything.

416
00:47:58.333 --> 00:47:59.956
No.

417
00:47:59.958 --> 00:48:03.208
Well. how about we go and
have a looksy what we got. huh?

418
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:08.290
Who fancies some pasta?

419
00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:10.292
Me.

420
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.833
Drake!

421
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.500
Drake. can you hear me!

422
00:49:00.542 --> 00:49:01.458
Drake!

423
00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:08.833
Drake. can you hear me!

424
00:49:22.583 --> 00:49:23.500
Drake?

425
00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:28.875
Drake?

426
00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:42.875
- Shhh.
- What is it?

427
00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:52.417
Don't move.

428
00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:55.581
Where is it?

429
00:49:55.583 --> 00:49:56.917
Stop moving.

430
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:00.917
Where is it!

431
00:50:59.583 --> 00:51:01.958
Must have been hungry?

432
00:51:03.458 --> 00:51:05.873
How long do you think
we're gonna be here?

433
00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:06.958
Caitlyn.

434
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.623
What I need to.

435
00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.333
Can we concentrate on
getting out of here first?

436
00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:23.375
Hey. Mark. you okay?

437
00:51:28.625 --> 00:51:31.500
It's just a cough I had.
Sometimes I feel sick.

438
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.667
Hey. are you okay?

439
00:51:39.917 --> 00:51:40.667
Thanks.

440
00:52:39.667 --> 00:52:41.083
Help me. help!

441
00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:51.125
Help somebody!

442
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:54.125
Somebody!

443
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:08.167
Help me!

444
00:53:14.583 --> 00:53:15.708
Help me. help!

445
00:53:16.792 --> 00:53:18.458
Stay here. Marky.

446
00:53:34.542 --> 00:53:36.790
What's going on?

447
00:53:36.792 --> 00:53:38.081
He's outside.

448
00:53:38.083 --> 00:53:39.248
Well. than just kill it.

449
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:44.458
Wait. we need backup now.
where in god's name is it.

450
00:53:45.167 --> 00:53:46.498
- find out.
- Yes sergeant.

451
00:53:59.625 --> 00:54:01.042
Oh my god.

452
00:54:07.292 --> 00:54:08.167
Help me.

453
00:54:12.292 --> 00:54:15.540
Damn it. get the
first aid kit now!

454
00:54:15.542 --> 00:54:17.208
Oh man. oh.

455
00:54:19.208 --> 00:54:21.500
Hold it. hold it.
hold him. hold him.

456
00:54:22.833 --> 00:54:24.708
Stay there.

457
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.165
- You can't leave.
- Stay here!

458
00:54:29.167 --> 00:54:32.083
Breathe
for me. breathe.

459
00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:34.167
Stay. stay.

460
00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:48.581
What we need to do
is we need to leave.

461
00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:52.873
Do not try and play
hard nuts with me girl.

462
00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:54.292
you do as I say.

463
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:56.792
Now stand down.

464
00:54:59.792 --> 00:55:01.623
If you have any sense
you will hear me

465
00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:03.708
and stand the hell down.

466
00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:11.081
Do not try and
play smart with me.

467
00:55:11.083 --> 00:55:13.331
this is your mess
we're clearing up here.

468
00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:15.250
Sergeant.

469
00:55:23.833 --> 00:55:25.706
Who points a gun at a kid?

470
00:55:25.708 --> 00:55:27.831
I don't care what he
says. we're getting the hell

471
00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:28.708
out of here now.

472
00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:34.667
Get Mark now. get Mark.

473
00:56:01.875 --> 00:56:05.748
I just need you
to breathe. okay?

474
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:06.873
It's okay.

475
00:56:06.875 --> 00:56:08.456
It killed Nick.

476
00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:11.415
What. it's okay. just
keep breathing for me.

477
00:56:11.417 --> 00:56:12.873
I'm gonna put some
pressure on it.

478
00:56:14.292 --> 00:56:16.290
Just breathe. just
keep breathing for me.

479
00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:17.790
Yeah. you're gonna be okay.

480
00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:20.750
I've got you. you're
gonna be okay.

481
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.375
Oh no!

482
00:58:21.917 --> 00:58:22.917
I'm sorry.

483
00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:40.500
What's going on?

484
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.417
We're getting out. okay. but
you've gotta be really quiet.

485
00:59:00.083 --> 00:59:05.042
When we get to the
car. drive. don't stop.

486
00:59:25.417 --> 00:59:26.917
Where do you think
you're running off to?

487
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.083
You think you're
going somewhere?

488
00:59:32.125 --> 00:59:36.000
Run. get out of here now.

489
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.417
No one's going anywhere.

490
00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:43.123
Go.

491
00:59:43.125 --> 00:59:44.415
No. Dad.

492
00:59:44.417 --> 00:59:47.498
What the hell
is going on here?

493
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.915
Girls run now!

494
00:59:48.917 --> 00:59:49.833
No. no.

495
00:59:51.958 --> 00:59:54.373
You get them back
inside this house now.

496
00:59:54.375 --> 00:59:56.915
We are leaving.

497
00:59:56.917 --> 00:59:59.456
You will do no such thing.

498
00:59:59.458 --> 01:00:03.165
Move out of my way!

499
01:00:05.917 --> 01:00:06.915
I won't move.

500
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.458
Dad. Dad!

501
01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:13.206
No. Dad come. Dad!

502
01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.081
Let's get in the car. go.

503
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:17.915
- Okay.

504
01:00:17.917 --> 01:00:20.375
in the back. get in the back.

505
01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:25.625
Go. go. go.

506
01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:27.456
Get your head down!

507
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:28.206
Get your head down!

508
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.540
Go!

509
01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.375
Come on. Jocelyn. go!

510

That's a boy. good boy.

511
01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:35.958
good boy!

512
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.623
Come on Jos!

513
01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:40.623
I'm trying!

514
01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:42.498
Quickly. faster!

515
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.375
Go!

516
01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:01.581
Sarge.

517
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.706
It's a dead end. the
barrier's blocking the road.

518
01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:36.665
Well. then go back
the way we came.

519
01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:37.540
Okay.

520
01:01:37.542 --> 01:01:40.790
Go on. Joc.
quickly. Joc. come on.

521
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.290
Oh the car won't start.

522
01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:43.998
What?

523
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.290
It won't start.

524
01:01:46.292 --> 01:01:48.125
I'm gonna check it.

525
01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.708
Is everything
going to be okay.

526
01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.125
Auntie Jocelyn. Auntie Jocelyn?

527
01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:42.581
Don't cry. Auntie.
please don't cry.

528
01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:46.040
I'm sorry.

529
01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:47.000
I know I shouldn't.

530
01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.792
How long have
you had that cough?

531
01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:03.792
Since Dad. since he left.

532
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:40.542
Hey look. something's
wrong with Mark.

533
01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:46.873
Something's happening.
the cough. the blood.

534
01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:48.167
I think it's serious.

535
01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:09.083
Shit.

536
01:04:12.792 --> 01:04:13.792
Over here.

537
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.125
Luna. what happened here?

538
01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:22.456
The raptor broke in.

539
01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.456
Luna. we need to figure
out a way to stop them now

540
01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.375
and fast.

541
01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:30.873
The reason the T-Rex
has grown to such size

542
01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:34.790
in such a small space of
time is because it seems

543
01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:38.290
that during his experimentation.
Simon unintentionally

544
01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.873
found a way to speed
up the cell growth

545
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:43.417
whilst he was genetically
modifying their DNA particles.

546
01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:46.873
Both the dinosaurs and
the boy were modified

547
01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:47.873
using the same methods.

548
01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:49.706
The boy. sorry?

549
01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:51.956
- You didn't know.
- Know what?

550
01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:56.331
The young boy
with them. he died.

551
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:59.331
Simon found a way to
manipulate the remains

552
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.790
of his dead cells
to bring him back.

553
01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:02.956
That seems to be where
this all started.

554
01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:06.373
Then he found and
extracted the dead cells

555
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:08.456
of the dinosaurs from
the fossils he was given

556
01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:10.331
as a part of another experiment.

557
01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:13.956
It seems from what I
can piece together.

558
01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:17.248
the rate of radiation of
pi during these processes

559
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.498
have ultimately led
to the rapid growth

560
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.915
within these creatures.

561
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.331
And that's why the T-Rex
is the size it is already.

562
01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.915
How old is the T-Rex?

563
01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:30.167
In our life years. I'd
say only a month or two.

564
01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:32.873
It grew to that size
in that amount of time?

565
01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.290
But it could be a good thing.

566
01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:37.956
to reach it's life
expectancy fast.

567
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.831
How long does the
raptor have left?

568
01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:44.373
That's the one that
you need to worry about.

569
01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:48.958
It's growth rate appears
to be the slowest.

570
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.956
Perhaps Simon used less
radiation in comparison

571
01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:55.915
when he was creating
the raptors.

572
01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:58.248
It could be many more months

573
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.915
until it reached
it's life expectancy

574
01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:02.748
and that's providing that
nothing goes wrong beforehand.

575
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.373
Meaning?

576
01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:05.790
There's are all
just experiments.

577
01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.415
very early stage experiments.

578
01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:11.248
It's very unlikely that
they'll reach full life

579
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.708
without any complications.

580
01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.373
How you feeling. buddy?

581
01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.667
I need to lay down.

582
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.790
Okay. well the
car's not working.

583
01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:28.415
so we're gonna have to
walk a little while.

584
01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:42.415
We need to get him to a doctor.

585
01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:50.790
So. how long until
backup arrives.

586
01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:53.748
I anticipate it won't be long
until that raptor returns.

587
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.415
They should be
here within the hour.

588
01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:56.750
An hour?

589
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.915
We could be dead meat by then.

590
01:06:59.917 --> 01:07:02.540
Grab yourself a
gun and be prepared.

591
01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:03.915
I don't know how to use a gun.

592
01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:06.998
Then learn and fast.

593
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.956
When you brought us here.
you said that we'd be safe

594
01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.165
and protected.

595
01:07:10.167 --> 01:07:12.456
I didn't expect to come
feet away from a T-Rex. did I?

596
01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:14.123
I wanna leave.

597
01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:16.998
We can go to the jeeps.

598
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.456
The jeeps are too far.

599
01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:21.623
Going out there. you
may as well put that gun

600
01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:24.456
to your head now. you
won't stand a chance.

601
01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.790
I'm going to hunt it down.

602
01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:28.915
The small one we got down
last time.

603
01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:31.917
We can do it again.

604
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.833
Well. you can't
just leave me here.

605
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.292
Lock the door behind you then.

606
01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:14.915
Screw this. I'm getting
the hell out of here.

607
01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:14.208
You won't get far
with that outside.

608
01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.167
Hey. hey wait.

609
01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:50.623
You sure you should
be holding that?

610
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:51.831
Well. there's a
dinosaur on the loose

611
01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:56.042
so. I guess I better
learn how to use it.

612
01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:27.206
Okay. we need to go faster.

613
01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.706
You think you could
walk a bit for me?

614
01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:29.665
Okay.

615
01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:30.708
Good boy. let's go.

616
01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:30.873
Got you.

617
01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:53.123
- Jos.
- What?

618
01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:55.292
I think I get why they
haven't left the area.

619
01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.790
It can't be the T-Rex.

620
01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:08.208
Yeah. but the two raptors.

621
01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.292
What do we do with them?

622
01:13:12.417 --> 01:13:14.290
I don't know. smash them.

623
01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:16.748
And risk pissing them
off more. no we're moving.

624
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:17.915
We can't keep doing this.

625
01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:20.290
we're walking around aimlessly
in circles. Mark's sick.

626
01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:23.625
I know. I know. I
don't know what to do.

627
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:30.290
Help me. help me.

628
01:13:30.292 --> 01:13:31.333
Don't move!

629
01:13:36.292 --> 01:13:37.790
Listen to me.

630
01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:39.831
No. we're not listening
to anything you say.

631
01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:42.165
Some prick just shot our dad.

632
01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:43.833
I'm not taking any
orders from you.

633
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.667
Is it war?

634
01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:49.956
You people don't
give a shit about us.

635
01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.250
I'm not like them.

636
01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:55.333
I'm running because it got them.

637
01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:03.750
They're all dead.
probably the sergeant.

638
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.873
I got lost running
trying to find the jeeps

639
01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.373
and then that T-Rex
came out of nowhere.

640
01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:10.206
I just want to get
the hell out of here.

641
01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:13.748
And if you come with me. then
we can leave here quickly.

642
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:18.750
Cate. put the gun
down. put it down.

643
01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.375
We know why they're
not leaving the area.

644
01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:41.290
Jesus.

645
01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:45.915
Jesus had nothing to do
with what's going on here.

646
01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:47.750
They look like
they're about to hatch.

647
01:14:51.042 --> 01:14:52.373
We thought the creatures
would pass soon

648
01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:54.248
but with more on the way.

649
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.792
- All right.
- Yeah.

650
01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:14.956
What is it?

651
01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:17.415
He seems to have run
into some complications

652
01:15:17.417 --> 01:15:18.750
with their growth rates.

653
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.833
He doesn't seem to have solved
it before he was killed.

654
01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:28.417
That little boy is growing fast.

655
01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.498
extremely fast for normal graphs

656
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.040
and Simon's research
has shown me

657
01:15:35.042 --> 01:15:40.208
it could be that within
the next year he's older.

658
01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:45.292
a lot older in years than the
normal human aging process.

659
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.915
What does all
that mean for Mark?

660
01:15:48.917 --> 01:15:53.917
He's showing symptoms that
he isn't responding well.

661
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.417
Just be straight with us.

662
01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:59.500
I'm so sorry. I
don't know what to say.

663
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:08.208
I've already lost him
once. I can't do it again.

664
01:16:10.042 --> 01:16:12.331
I don't know what to say.

665
01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:22.333
Auntie. what is it?

666
01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:25.458
Is something bad
happening to you?

667
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.956
No. honey. I'm fine and
you're gonna be fine too.

668
01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:43.456
you hear me?

669
01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:48.458
Promise me you're okay. I
want you to be sad anymore.

670
01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:57.040
We need to keep moving.

671
01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:59.040
Backup's on the way. if
we can get to those jeeps.

672
01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:00.456
we'll get a head start.

673
01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:01.375
Come on.

674
01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:21.415
Run!

675
01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:29.375
Help me!

676
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.625
- Hey over here!
- Caitlyn!

677
01:18:29.708 --> 01:18:32.040
What are you doing!

678
01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:32.958
Caitlyn!

679
01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:40.542
Okay. okay. it's okay. I
got you. all right. okay.

680
01:19:06.292 --> 01:19:07.167
Caitlyn!

681
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:19.167
Okay. okay. all right.

682
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.708
Okay. okay. you're all right.

683
01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:33.206
It's okay. it's okay.
you're gonna be fine.

684
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.208
Caitlyn!

685
01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:53.748
Mark look. we're
safe. they're here.

686
01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:22.667
What?

687
01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:46.292
No. no!

688
01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:53.290
Oh he's

689
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:58.206
I know. we've gotta let
him go. Joc. Joc. look at me.

690
01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:00.915
look at me. look at
me. do you see me?

691
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:08.250
I'm here. it's okay. I'm here.

692
01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:12.875
- I had him.
- I know.

693
01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:17.542
But at least we got
to see him one last time.

694
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.875
It's okay.
