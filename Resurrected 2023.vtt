3
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:11.305
- Hello. my love!

4
00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.611
- Hey. babe! How was the game?

5
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:16.092
- It was great. we won.

6
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:17.180
Nicky hit two singles
and a double.

7
00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:19.095
Tell your mom about the game.

8
00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.489
I would've got the triple.
but I tripped over second base.

9
00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:24.274
- That's why I tell you to keep
rounding your corners. remember?

10
00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:27.451
- Hey. a double is
really great. too. sweetie.

11
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.845
Stan. why isn't Nicky
in the back in his car seat?

12
00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.064
- Cause he's a big boy.
he's not a little baby anymore.

13
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.066
He gets to ride up in front with
his old man

14
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:36.112
cause he's a champion and that's
what the champions do.

15
00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:38.375
- He's too small. okay?
It's not very safe.

16
00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.029
- Daddy took the team
out to lunch

17
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.857
at the Dugout
after the game!

18
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.773
- Yes. he did. Grilled cheeses
for everybody.

19
00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.470
- The Dugout. huh?

20
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.168
Did daddy had anything to drink
with his lunch?

21
00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:50.257
- Yes. I had one beer. Aud.
thank you for asking.

22
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:51.997
- And a whiskey.

23
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.652
- You. little snitch.
- Stan. you're driving.

24
00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:56.045
- I'm completely fine. It was an
hour and a half ago.

25
00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.612
I had a
full meal.

26
00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.570
Hey. we're gonna pass the stores
here in a minute.

27
00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.268
You want me to grab something
for dinner? A bottle of wine?

28
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:03.008
What are we going
to eat tonight?

29
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.793
- Pizza!

30
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.449
- Well. what did you eat
at the Dugout?

31
00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:12.192
- Pizza...
- You want pizza again?

32
00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.846
Yep. Pizza is my favorite food.

33
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.718
Oooh. I love this song!

34
00:03:16.892 --> 00:03:20.025
- Do you like Billy Joel?
How do you even know Billy Joel?

35
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.158
- He's Alexa Ray's father.
right?

36
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:24.116
- Who is Alexa Ray?

37
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.075
- You know. coach.
someday you gonna have

38
00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.338
to actually teach your son
what this song is about.

39
00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.384
- I don't know.
what is it about?

40
00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.037
- What is it about. daddy?

41
00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:37.304
No. no. No.
Oh. please. God. no!

42
00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:16.316
- Audrey. huh I had to borrow
one of the nurse's phones.

43
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.622
Just talk to me. please.

44
00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:21.408
Please. come to the hospital.
Please.

45
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:23.888
I can't.

46
00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:27.892
- But this wasn't my fault.
I only had one drink.

47
00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:31.243
I was within the legal limit.
I wasn't intoxicated.

48
00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:32.462
That truck was out of control.

49
00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:34.072
There was nothing I could do.

50
00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:36.205
- Your reflexes were slowed.

51
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.293
You didn't put Nicky
in his car seat.

52
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:38.773
He might have survived.

53
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:43.081
We don't know that.

54
00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:47.390
- Exactly. And we never will.
I told you

55
00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.131
I told you a hundred times
no to drink and drive.

56
00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:50.480
A hundred times!

57
00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:53.265
Please...

58
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.878
- And now my baby is dead.

59
00:05:57.052 --> 00:05:59.359
He was my child too.

60
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:06.191
I just need you
to forgive me.

61
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.501
I can't I can't.
it's too soon.

62
00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.068
How can you ask me that?

63
00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:16.550
I need you
I need my mountain...

64
00:06:16.724 --> 00:06:19.379
- Don't Don't call me that.

65
00:06:19.553 --> 00:06:23.078
You have everything you need.

66
00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:25.167
The hospital has
all your information.

67
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.387
It's up to you.
You'll be fine.

68
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.867
No. wait. please.
I need my...

69
00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:47.363
I told you to leave me
the fuck alone!

70
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:50.584
- Audrey.

71
00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:56.241
- Oh. God. Father Hill.
I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.419
I thought you're someone else.
Please. forgive me.

73
00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:02.247
- You thought I was Stanley?

74
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.988
- Yeah. he's just called
from the hospital.

75
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:06.077
He won't give up.

76
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:09.733
When I see him
I just I wanna scream.

77
00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:12.519
- Of course. I understand.

78
00:07:12.693 --> 00:07:15.522
I can't even imagine how hard
all of this is for you.

79
00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:18.525
And I'm praying for you.
And for Stanley.

80
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:25.053
Oh. no. I didn't mean.
Look at me.

81
00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:28.752
I'm calling to give you
good news and I'm ruining it.

82
00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:30.493
- Good news?

83
00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.887
- Yes. Audrey. the church has
been searching

84
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.280
for someone like you.

85
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.849
Someone who deserves
a second chance.

86
00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:40.895
- Father. I don't understand.

87
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:43.332
- I know this is
going to seem daunting.

88
00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:45.465
But allow me to connect you

89
00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.684
with someone who can explain it.

90
00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:52.515
Audrey. this is Cardinal Degal.

91
00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.648
- Hello. my child.

92
00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:58.042
I have learned of your loss.
I am so sorry.

93
00:07:58.216 --> 00:08:02.830
Thank you.
Your... Holiness.

94
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.745
- Your Eminence. technically.

95
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.965
but I think Cardinal Degal
will do just fine.

96
00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.447
- Okay.

97
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:14.406
- I'm sure you're a bit
confused. allow me to explain.

98
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:18.498
I'm in charge of a special
project here in the Vatican.

99
00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:20.500
Our mission is to help people

100
00:08:20.674 --> 00:08:23.503
who have been struck
by great tragedy.

101
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.592
Needless to say.
when I heard your story.

102
00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:29.204
I thought. perhaps
she could use our help.

103
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:33.948
- I don't understand.
Help how?

104
00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:36.254
- A miracle.

105
00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.257
I am here to offer you
a miracle.

106
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.961
I am Cardinal Degal.

107
00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:48.615
Today is the 27th of January.

108
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:51.269
in the year of our Lord 2023.

109
00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:54.925
time is approximately 7:32 a.m.

110
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.536
We're about to bring
Subject Nineteen

111
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.973
into the Antechamber.

112
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.889
From everything we've learned
in previous trials.

113
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.892
I am very hopeful that...

114
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:11.942
No. I am certain

115
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:15.119
that we will succeed
with our first attempt.

116
00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:21.604
May God grant us all
His blessings.

117
00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:31.179
Let's get started.

118
00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:44.366
Miss Martin. have faith.
Have faith.

119
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.717
I'm sorry. I cannot
let you enter this room.

120
00:09:47.891 --> 00:09:49.850
You have to wait here.

121
00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:51.765
- But

122
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:53.767
- Faith. my child.

123
00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:19.270
Miss Martin.
there is someone

124
00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:21.664
who wants to see you.

125
00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:30.586
This is God's miracle.

126
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.589
Your son was chosen to be
the first Resurrected Person.

127
00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:36.548
And now he stands as an example
of what awaits

128
00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:40.248
all people who follow
the Word of God.

129
00:10:40.422 --> 00:10:42.206
We join you tonight
with an extraordinary

130
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.078
story out of the Vatican.

131
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:45.775
where the Church has claimed to
achieve the impossible.

132
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.952
They discovered how to resurrect
the recently deceased.

133
00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:51.912
The Pope assures the world
that this is not a hoax.

134
00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:55.089
The Church has been pursuing
this endeavor for decades.

135
00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.917
Now they say they have
successfully

136
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:58.745
brought a young boy killed in
car crash back to life.

137
00:10:58.919 --> 00:10:59.963
Obviously. there is
much skepticism

138
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:01.661
surrounding the story.

139
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:03.184
Especially. considering
the Church's refusal

140
00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:04.751
to reveal the science
behind it.

141
00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:06.535
Still. as of yet no one
has been able

142
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:08.929
to explain how the boy
was revived.

143
00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:10.539
- So. how does this fit in

144
00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:13.020
with the traditional
teachings of the Church?

145
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:15.239
- We're not abandoning
tradition.

146
00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:18.199
We're simply trying to move the
Church into the 21st century.

147
00:11:18.373 --> 00:11:20.201
while still following
the sacred scriptures

148
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.507
that have been handed down
to us by God.

149
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.335
- But you're saying people

150
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:26.773
have to convert
if they want immortality.

151
00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:29.819
- We're not offering
immortality.

152
00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:33.475
We're simply offering
second chance to those

153
00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:36.870
who accept Jesus Christ
as their Lord and Savior.

154
00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:56.324
Hey. guys. I dunno about you

155
00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:58.413
but with all
the Reincarnation stuff.

156
00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:01.155
I'm feeling a bit riskier
than usual.

157
00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:04.071
For the record.
this is not a suicide.

158
00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:06.421
I'm a good Christian. I love
God.

159
00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:08.858
I'm just trying to
pull off some gnarly shit.

160
00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.426
So. if I don't make it.

161
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.211
make sure Jesus brings me back.

162
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.778
Peace!

163
00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:25.135
Death is natural. it's part
of the organic life cycle.

164
00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:27.790
even when it's tragic.

165
00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:30.706
But what the Catholic Church
is offering is dangerous.

166
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.621
It hasn't even been
vetted by the FDA.

167
00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:34.405
The Surgeon General has
no idea how it works.

168
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.712
And nobody has any clue
what they're actually doing.

169
00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:38.801
and yet their protections
as a religion

170
00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:41.195
allows them to break the laws
of nature?!

171
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.069
- Ms. Martin. how is it
that you were granted

172
00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:47.810
an annulment after
six years of marriage?

173
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:49.377
- No comment.

174
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.683
- Mr. Martin.

175
00:12:51.858 --> 00:12:52.423
what do you have to say to your
son's role as spokesperson for
RPs.

176
00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:54.121
- Fuck off.

177
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:55.687
- How did you get

178
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.341
the Ecclesiastical Tribunal
to agree to that?

179
00:12:57.515 --> 00:12:59.430
- Speak with Bishop Hill
of the Archdiocese.

180
00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:01.302
Now. leave us in peace. please.

181
00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:03.086
- When have you last spoken
to your son?

182
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.609
- Fuck off!

183
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.438
- Sir. any thoughts
on RPs at all?

184
00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:09.397
Let the people know
what it's like

185
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:11.007
to have your son brought back.

186
00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:12.574
As you can see.
not everyone is thrilled

187
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:15.229
by resurrecting family
members that have died

188
00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:18.275
The ban on baptism has created

189
00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:20.408
a lucrative black market
for smugglers.

190
00:13:20.582 --> 00:13:24.151
who offer to sneak dead loved
ones out of the Middle East.

191
00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:26.327
Just past the border.
the bodies

192
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.459
are posthumously baptized
by missionary Priests

193
00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:31.723
and sent off to the nearest
Resurrection Center.

194
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.034
- So. in order for the Church
to resurrect me

195
00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.820
I have to hand over my entire
digital history.

196
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:44.345
We're talking phone calls.
texts. emails. hard drives.

197
00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.042
This is crazy.

198
00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:47.783
What about privacy?

199
00:13:47.957 --> 00:13:49.524
Is the Church trying to become
the new Big Brother?

200
00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:51.874
- Dude. first of all. you don t
have to sign a contract.

201
00:13:52.048 --> 00:13:53.528
Besides. the Church
can only access

202
00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:55.573
this information after
your death.

203
00:13:55.747 --> 00:13:57.097
While you're alive
nobody's gonna know

204
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.663
what porn you like watching

205
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.578
and who you've been sending
your dickpics to.

206
00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:02.145
- All right. let's talk about
these "Cherubs" for a second.

207
00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:04.060
Cause this is really crazy.

208
00:14:04.234 --> 00:14:06.715
The Church is hiring ex-hackers
to look for my sins.

209
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:10.197
So. some guy who only yesterday
was hacking the White House

210
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:12.677
or steal money from somebody's
bank account

211
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.811
is now going to rummage through
my entire digital past

212
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:19.336
and judge me for my sins.
What the hell?

213
00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:24.951
How do you wanna believe us
in this nonsense?

214
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:27.779
Why do all the resurrected
return without a single scratch?

215
00:14:27.954 --> 00:14:29.912
What about the bullet wounds.
scars. and all this crap?

216
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.566
Wake up. it's all a scam...

217
00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.440
- Audrey. one thing we all
want to know.

218
00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:38.355
Is he better behaved now?

219
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:41.532
Like. do you have to fight to
get him to do his homework?

220
00:14:41.706 --> 00:14:44.796
Yeah. he's a normal kid. Just
like he was before and huh

221
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:47.147
But. yes. we sort of fight over
homework sometimes.

222
00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:51.107
- Well. Nicholas.
I guess being the very first

223
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:52.326
resurrected person
doesn't excuse you

224
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.893
from certain responsibilities.

225
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:55.895
What do you think about that?

226
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:59.681
- I feel blessed.
Until I have to do my homework.

227
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:23.096
I'm sure all of you know
Nicholas Martin's story by now.

228
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.532
Most of you probably saw
the interview

229
00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:27.622
when it first aired
five years ago.

230
00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:30.581
Then we lived in a cruel world
where children like Nicholas

231
00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:32.540
could be ripped from
their parents' arms

232
00:15:32.714 --> 00:15:33.976
without a moment's notice.

233
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.197
But cruelty is not God's will.

234
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.025
for when one of his purest
creations was taken away.

235
00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:42.680
he returned unharmed.

236
00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:46.380
He gave Nicholas
a second chance.

237
00:15:46.554 --> 00:15:50.384
And that's what resurrection is.
A second chance.

238
00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:54.562
For family. for love. for life.

239
00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:58.740
And understand. resurrection is
not about immortality.

240
00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:02.831
No. it's more like a safety net
for our time here on Earth.

241
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.790
In the end. we must all return
to God's Kingdom.

242
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.490
And that's the real reward for
living a good. righteous life.

243
00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:25.114
All right. that's it for today.

244
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.464
May the Lord be with you.

245
00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:29.640
May the Almighty God bless you.

246
00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:32.904
The Father. the Son and
the Holy Spirit. Amen.

247
00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.254
Amen!

248
00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:04.240
- Hey. Dad.

249
00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:07.156
Heeey.
St. Nick. What's up. buddy?

250
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.159
- I'm good. Mom says hi.

251
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.292
- Great. Hey. Audrey.

252
00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:13.815
What do you cook?

253
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:14.903
- Well. it smells good anyway.

254
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.383
So. what's up?

255
00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:17.601
Tell me how you've been.
tell me everything.

256
00:17:17.775 --> 00:17:18.994
How is school?

257
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:20.691
- Well. it's almost
Spring Break.

258
00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:22.780
So. I didn't really
learn anything.

259
00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:26.001
Mom's taking me to the graffiti
exhibit at the Art Center.

260
00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.872
- Well. mom's is a fun machine.

261
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.787
- Yeah.

262
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:31.485
- Look. I wanted to talk to you
about Spring Break.

263
00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:34.923
- Well. yeah.
it's gonna be awesome.

264
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:38.057
Tuesday I'm doing a lecture
at the Catholic Youth League.

265
00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:41.538
And later for the eighth grade
classes of Saint Francis.

266
00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:46.021
Wednesday I'm doing RP at
the Children's Brunch.

267
00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:49.329
And Thursday is

268
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:52.158
I don't really remember
but there is something.

269
00:17:52.332 --> 00:17:54.377
- Busy is good.
Busy is good.

270
00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:56.336
- Yeah.

271
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.033
- What do you talk about when
you talk to all these people?

272
00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:00.035
You ever get nervous?

273
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:01.993
- No. honestly they wanna know
about the resurrection.

274
00:18:02.168 --> 00:18:03.517
How my life has changed.

275
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:07.260
and stuff like that.
I like it. It's fun.

276
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:09.479
- You know. your old man does
a lot of public speaking.

277
00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:11.786
I could give you some pointers.
If you want.

278
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.701
- No. don't worry.
If I ever get stuck. Bishop Hill

279
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.746
usually asks me a question
or helps me out but

280
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.315
I don't usually.

281
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:21.926
- Sure.
- Oh. I almost forgot.

282
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.190
We're gonna have
an Easter party here.

283
00:18:24.364 --> 00:18:27.236
- Christ's resurrection
is a big day for us.

284
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.325
- Yeah.

285
00:18:29.499 --> 00:18:31.936
- What? What is it?
Something wrong?

286
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.896
- I was thinking I can ask
mom to invite you.

287
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:38.204
Nicholas!

288
00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:45.167
- Hey. you know what. buddy.
Don't bother her.

289
00:18:45.341 --> 00:18:46.951
If she wants to invite me.
she will. Okay?

290
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.390
And I probably. I definitely.
have a mass that day.

291
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.131
Nicholas!

292
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:54.742
- Okay. I gotta go.
I love you. dad.

293
00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.178
- I love you too.

294
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.919
Hey. can you put
your mom on for a second?

295
00:18:58.093 --> 00:19:01.575
- Yeah. just one sec.
Hey. mom. Dad wants to talk.

296
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.011
- Heeeey.
- Hi!

297
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.708
- What's up? How are you?

298
00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:07.885
- Everything's good.
We are fine.

299
00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:10.888
- Great. Hey. Audrey. listen.

300
00:19:11.062 --> 00:19:13.587
He missed our call last week.

301
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.545
You know.
it's really important to me

302
00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:17.678
that I get this time
with him.

303
00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:20.159
It's really the only chance
we have to talk

304
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:21.899
and I need these calls.

305
00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:24.250
- Yeah. sorry. I know.
He's just so busy right now.

306
00:19:24.424 --> 00:19:27.905
- Yeah. he tells me he is
talking to all sort of groups.

307
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:30.473
But is he getting
enough down time.

308
00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:33.346
does he get enough time
to be himself?

309
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.261
Is he even
playing sports anymore?

310
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:37.393
- You know. it's his choice.
I've asked him.

311
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:38.829
He's having fun.
he's meeting

312
00:19:39.003 --> 00:19:39.787
a lot of new people.
learning a lot.

313
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:42.355
He's fine. Stan. really.

314
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:45.401
- Cool. Cool.

315
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.751
Oh. he told me that you guys
are having an Easter party.

316
00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:49.579
Is that right?

317
00:19:49.753 --> 00:19:51.929
- Ah. yeah. I thought he could
use a little celebration.

318
00:19:52.103 --> 00:19:55.629
- Definitely. It's a good idea.
Great idea.

319
00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:58.675
Who is coming?

320
00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:01.896
- Umm. Nicky's friends from
school. some of the neighbors.

321
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.072
He's been talking to so many
large groups lately.

322
00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:06.422
I wanna keep this one small.

323
00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:08.250
- Yeah.

324
00:20:08.424 --> 00:20:09.947
- Yeaaah.

325
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:16.084
- Okay. I won't keep you.

326
00:20:17.607 --> 00:20:19.783
Take care. Aud.

327
00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:22.786
- You too. Stan. Bye.

328
00:20:23.787 --> 00:20:25.746
Little Mountain...

329
00:20:32.796 --> 00:20:36.974
They told me it was going to
feel strange coming back.

330
00:20:37.148 --> 00:20:41.022
that I will have to readjust
to being alive.

331
00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:45.635
But I didn't think it was going
to be this hard.

332
00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:48.334
- I believed in Islam.

333
00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:49.813
And one day I die and wake up

334
00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:51.075
and my wife tells me
I've been baptized

335
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.947
- Do you resent her for that?

336
00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:55.950
- No. she went to a great risk
to smuggle my body

337
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.518
out of Syria just
to bring me back.

338
00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:00.476
- You know. she did it
because she loves you.

339
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.826
- This is a waste of time.
Father.

340
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.654
- Well. it's mandatory
Frank.

341
00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:06.961
Every RP has two months
of counseling.

342
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:09.964
I'm sorry but it's to help you
to integrate back in the life.

343
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:13.707
- When you finally reach the end
and see what's beyond.

344
00:21:13.881 --> 00:21:16.449
It's an incredible rush.

345
00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:18.842
Have you ever died. Father?

346
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:20.844
I think I've asked you
that already.

347
00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:22.933
- I have not.

348
00:21:23.107 --> 00:21:25.022
- It's amazing.

349
00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:28.374
- You know. after the car crash
they didn't bring her back.

350
00:21:28.548 --> 00:21:30.245
Just me.

351
00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:34.293
When I ask them why.
they show me these text messages

352
00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:36.991
that a cherub has found.
I mean. okay.

353
00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:39.646
I know that she was cheating
on me with some guy

354
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.344
but it's not a murder.

355
00:21:42.518 --> 00:21:44.607
It's not a war crime.

356
00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:48.742
- Well. as I understand it

357
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:52.354
- I don't care what she did.

358
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:57.794
If I can forgive her. Father.
why can't God?

359
00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:01.102
Why can't
the Church. huh?

360
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:05.280
- Well. I still can't sleep.
Every time I close my eyes

361
00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:08.457
I'd see him coming at me
with that knife.

362
00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:12.200
I feel it slicing into me.

363
00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:19.033
Ice cold. yet it burned...

364
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:20.687
- We were struggling
before I died.

365
00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:22.253
We are struggling worse now.

366
00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:24.081
My company downsized

367
00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:26.345
while my family was waiting for
me to be brought back.

368
00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.564
Now I can't get a job.

369
00:22:28.738 --> 00:22:30.958
Everywhere I go companies
don't wanna hire RPs.

370
00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:32.438
I'm ready to sell our home.
take my family

371
00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:34.135
and move to another country.

372
00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:36.485
Show them a better way.

373
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.878
- Before you do that
you might be

374
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.532
interested to know
that I reached out

375
00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:41.185
the foreman of your old
construction site.

376
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.883
I had a little word with him.

377
00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:45.364
And well. I think you're ready
to start on Monday.

378
00:22:46.277 --> 00:22:47.888
- Really?

379
00:22:48.062 --> 00:22:49.890
Damn right!

380
00:22:50.064 --> 00:22:52.414
- So. I let a stupid cancer
take me instead

381
00:22:52.588 --> 00:22:57.114
and it took forever
and it really hurt.

382
00:22:57.288 --> 00:22:58.551
And now that I'm back

383
00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:01.336
everybody's at school
looking at me

384
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.339
like I'm some kind of freak.

385
00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:06.863
I wish I killed myself
when I have a chance.

386
00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:10.389
And my parents wouldn't be able
to bring me back at all.

387
00:23:10.563 --> 00:23:13.043
- Look. I don't like when you
talk about hurting yourself.

388
00:23:13.217 --> 00:23:16.090
You're a righteous person.

389
00:23:16.264 --> 00:23:18.614
You were challenged.
You stayed strong.

390
00:23:18.788 --> 00:23:21.269
It's amazing. Rose.

391
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:25.404
Rose. you are amazing! Okay?

392
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.060
- All right. That's our time.

393
00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:31.366
You good? You gonna be okay?

394
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.237
- I'm amazing.

395
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.414
- Talk soon.

396
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:52.376
Hey. love.
I'm glad you called.

397
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.554
I was getting so bored sitting
here alone.

398
00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:59.601
Anything I can do to help you?

399
00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:01.864
Where is the camera?
I can't see you.

400
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:09.089
Ooh. you must be a celebrity.
Or a politician.

401
00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:12.962
I see you've taken out Demerit
Sweeper Insurance. Good.

402
00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:15.965
What would you like me to do?

403
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.538
That's brilliant.

404
00:26:23.712 --> 00:26:26.019
Because ever since we connected

405
00:26:26.193 --> 00:26:28.325
I wanted to tell you
all the nasty things

406
00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:35.158
Well. just talk.
Anything in particular?

407
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:49.042
My day? It's been an average day
like many other.

408
00:26:52.393 --> 00:26:55.918
An average day The truth
or the fantasy?

409
00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:04.187
I took my son to school at 9
and went shopping for food.

410
00:27:04.361 --> 00:27:07.495
picked up some shirts
at the cleaner's.

411
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:11.020
My husband picked up our son
from school at 3.

412
00:27:11.194 --> 00:27:13.849
Then I made dinner and

413
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.986
Of course. We don't keep secrets
from each other.

414
00:27:28.864 --> 00:27:31.171
Well... I don't wanna be
resurrected.

415
00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:32.912
I am a One-Lifer.

416
00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:34.827
When my time is up. it's up.

417
00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:37.438
Let nature take its course.
is how I look at it.

418
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:40.702
Well. now it's your turn.

419
00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:43.183
Tell me about your day.

420
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:41.763
- Good morning. Bishop.

421
00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:44.723
- Good morning.
Haven't you seen the news?

422
00:28:44.897 --> 00:28:48.465
No. sorry. I just woke up.
I was having a late morning.

423
00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:51.425
- Stan. there's been
an incident.

424
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.253
- What kind of incident?

425
00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:56.691
In Pittsburgh. they're
constructing some skyscraper

426
00:28:56.865 --> 00:28:58.214
and one of
the construction workers

427
00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:01.391
just started pushing his
coworkers off the edge.

428
00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:04.307
Seventeen people fell
to their death.

429
00:29:04.481 --> 00:29:06.266
- Oh my God. it's horrible.

430
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.444
It gets worse The man
who did it was an RP.

431
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:15.231
This isn't just some RP. this
man was someone from your flock.

432
00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:17.799
You were his counselor. Stan.

433
00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:22.412
- Oh my God! Frank Collins?

434
00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:24.980
That doesn't make any sense.

435
00:29:25.154 --> 00:29:28.070
I just saw Frank.
Where is he now?

436
00:29:28.244 --> 00:29:30.986
- The cops had to shoot him with
a bean bag gun and he fell.

437
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.555
- What do you mean he fell?

438
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:36.470
- 12 stories. He's dead.

439
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:39.778
- There was no sign he was
suicidal. None!

440
00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:41.954
Nothing! He was happy.

441
00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:44.304
I just helped him to get his
job back. He was happy!

442
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:47.307
- This doesn't look good
for the Church. Stan.

443
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:48.874
We are strategizing what to do

444
00:29:49.048 --> 00:29:50.745
and we are going
to need your help.

445
00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:53.313
- Anything. What's the protocol
for something like that?

446
00:29:53.487 --> 00:29:55.489
- There's no protocol
for something like this!

447
00:29:55.663 --> 00:29:57.796
It's never happened before.

448
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.930
Now. I'm setting you up with a
video chat with an agent Ortiz.

449
00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:03.366
She is in charge with

450
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.979
Resurrected Persons Unit
of the FBI

451
00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:09.416
and I really need you
to cooperate with her.

452
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.244
- Of course. your Excellency.

453
00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:15.248
- That means to give her
whatever information she wants.

454
00:30:15.422 --> 00:30:17.728
And I mean it. Stan.
Whatever she wants.

455
00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:22.690
- Yes. Bishop.

456
00:30:22.864 --> 00:30:24.997
- Now. in the meantime.

457
00:30:25.171 --> 00:30:30.916
I think it might
be best for you to take a break.

458
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.787
- But what about my
congregation?

459
00:30:32.961 --> 00:30:34.354
- Oh no. we'll provide a
substitute Priest. of course.

460
00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:36.443
Your flock will be
in good hands.

461
00:30:36.617 --> 00:30:39.446
And it's only temporary.
of course.

462
00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.535
- Am I being suspended
right now?

463
00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:44.103
- Oh. Stan. calm down.

464
00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:46.061
I'm doing what I think is best

465
00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:47.236
just until the spotlight
is off of you

466
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.369
and the dust settles.

467
00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:51.588
And Stan.
there's another thing.

468
00:30:51.762 --> 00:30:53.286
It's best
if you avoid contact

469
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.854
with Nicholas
for the time being.

470
00:30:56.028 --> 00:30:58.291
- Well now wait a minute. what
does he have to do with this?

471
00:30:58.465 --> 00:31:02.599
- Nothing. And we need
to keep it that way.

472
00:31:02.773 --> 00:31:05.080
You don't want the press asking
him a lot of questions. do you?

473
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:07.474
We must protect him from that.

474
00:31:07.648 --> 00:31:11.130
- I would never.
ever involve him.

475
00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:14.568
- No. you wouldn't.
but others would.

476
00:31:14.742 --> 00:31:18.093
I'm only asking for silence.
Once this thing calms down

477
00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.313
you can contact Nicholas
whenever you want.

478
00:31:22.141 --> 00:31:25.057
I'm sorry. Stan. I'm so sorry
about this.

479
00:31:27.798 --> 00:31:29.713
- Let's pray for the victims.

480
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:32.978
- Yes. the victims. indeed.

481
00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:46.948
- But by Resurrecting
the victims.

482
00:31:47.122 --> 00:31:49.081
aren't you effectively saying

483
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.647
"it's okay to kill people.

484
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:52.954
because there aren't any
consequences"?

485
00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:55.043
- Forgive me for saying
so but that's ridiculous.

486
00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:57.089
Of course. there are
consequences.

487
00:31:57.263 --> 00:31:59.569
The Fifth Commandant:
thou shalt not kill.

488
00:31:59.743 --> 00:32:04.400
It is a mortal sin for anyone
to take the life of a human
being.

489
00:32:04.574 --> 00:32:05.836
anyone who commits such sin

490
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:07.708
is no longer eligible
for Resurrection.

491
00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:10.493
There is a consequence.

492
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:13.714
Look. I just don't see
why the actions

493
00:32:13.888 --> 00:32:18.197
of one troubled man should ruin
the lives of the Resurrected?

494
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.286
- But what do you say
to the One-Lifers.

495
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.030
who insist that it isn't natural
to be tampering with mortality?

496
00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:29.991
They say bringing humans back to
life is devaluing being alive.

497
00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:32.559
- The One-Lifers are fanatics
and atheists.

498
00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.909
They have no beliefs. no faith.

499
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.911
They think we're no different
than insects.

500
00:32:47.226 --> 00:32:51.012
- Hello. Agent Ortiz?

501
00:32:51.186 --> 00:32:55.016
- Yes. Father Martin. Bishop
Hill told you I'd be calling.

502
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.236
- He did. yes.

503
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.325
I'm at Resurrected Persons Unit
of the bureau.

504
00:32:59.499 --> 00:33:01.544
You were the perpetrator's
mental health counselor.

505
00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:02.806
Is that correct?

506
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.983
- Yes. and his Priest.

507
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:07.811
- Were you surprised when you
heard what he had done?

508
00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:11.076
- I was shocked.
- I'm in shock. I still am.

509
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:18.692
It doesn't make any sense.
He was... He was happy.

510
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:20.737
I just helped him
to get his job back

511
00:33:20.911 --> 00:33:22.957
- So. no reported depression?

512
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:27.179
- None. If anything. he was
happier than he's ever been.

513
00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:29.398
I mean he...

514
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:31.618
- I need you to send me
the recordings

515
00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:33.315
of your sessions
with Frank Collins.

516
00:33:33.489 --> 00:33:35.970
Can you email those to me?

517
00:33:36.144 --> 00:33:37.667
- Well. that would be
a violation

518
00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:39.321
of the sanctity of the seal.

519
00:33:39.495 --> 00:33:42.498
The Church doesn't record
sessions.

520
00:33:42.672 --> 00:33:44.283
- Actually. they do.

521
00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:46.633
And Bishop Hill assured me
that you would cooperate.

522
00:33:48.374 --> 00:33:50.115
- Even if that was true...

523
00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:54.119
- It's true.
You and I both know it.

524
00:33:54.293 --> 00:33:58.297
- To do so would be instant
grounds for excommunication.

525
00:33:58.471 --> 00:34:00.908
I could lose my priesthood.

526
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:02.431
- The Penitent is
no longer alive.

527
00:34:02.605 --> 00:34:03.911
and he is not coming back.

528
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.088
I could get a court order.

529
00:34:07.262 --> 00:34:12.050
but I'd really hate to do that
because it would cost me a day.

530
00:34:12.224 --> 00:34:14.487
But just so you know.
if I get that court order.

531
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:16.967
we come in like gangbusters.

532
00:34:17.142 --> 00:34:19.057
And we are liable
to do some damage.

533
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:21.842
I'll have to confiscate
all of your devices.

534
00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:24.323
That means your cellphone too.

535
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:27.021
So. no Internet.
no phone access

536
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:29.154
until my investigation
is complete.

537
00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:33.114
Cut off. Is that understood?

538
00:34:34.898 --> 00:34:37.466
- That won't be necessary.

539
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.601
I can email those
files over to you now.

540
00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:45.170
- Thank you. Father.
Have a great day.

541
00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.347
- Yeah. You too. asshole.

542
00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:14.242
My brothers and sisters.
it's good to see you all here
connected today.

543
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:15.896
Unfortunately. due to some
personal affairs

544
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.072
that require my attention.

545
00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:21.380
I will be unable to lead
tonight's mass.

546
00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:23.599
So. I'll be taking
a short leave of absence.

547
00:35:23.773 --> 00:35:25.427
But don't worry.

548
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:28.909
I'm leaving you in the capable
hands of Father Dorian.

549
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.476
- Does this have anything to do

550
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.999
with what happened in
Pittsburgh. Father?

551
00:35:32.173 --> 00:35:33.957
- Is the church responsible?

552
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.872
- I can assure you

553
00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:37.483
that the authorities and
the Church are investigating.

554
00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:38.875
Right now I don't know
any more than you do.

555
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:40.660
- Is that why you're leaving?

556
00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:42.836
- No.
- Were you fired?

557
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.795
- As I said. I have some
personal affairs to attend to.

558
00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:47.797
- Did that guy
kill all those people

559
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:49.799
- because he was resurrected?
- My wife is being resurrected

560
00:35:49.973 --> 00:35:51.627
next week. is she gonna try to
kill me and the kids?

561
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:53.063
- How did the Church managed
to resurrect the murderer?

562
00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:55.196
- What do you hide?

563
00:39:02.818 --> 00:39:04.298
Although the police have not
confirmed

564
00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.344
the identity of
the perpetrator.

565
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:08.476
we've learned that his name
was Frank Collins.

566
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.394
an RP working sporadically in
the construction industry.

567
00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:15.222
We've also learned
that the FBI's

568
00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:18.443
RP Unit has taken charge
of this case.

569
00:39:18.617 --> 00:39:21.228
led by Agent Gloria Ortiz.

570
00:39:21.402 --> 00:39:24.144
At the same time. the Church has
released a statement that...

571
00:40:28.338 --> 00:40:30.689
What the hell?

572
00:42:18.318 --> 00:42:19.667
- Hello!

573
00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:21.190
- Hi. are you Cherub 45274?

574
00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:22.583
- What?

575
00:42:23.976 --> 00:42:25.673
- Hi. are you Cherub

576
00:42:25.847 --> 00:42:26.892
- Wait. hold on!

577
00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.163
- Sorry about that. Father.
What can I do for you?

578
00:42:37.337 --> 00:42:39.818
- Are you Cherub 45274?

579
00:42:39.992 --> 00:42:41.820
- That's me.

580
00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:43.473
They put
you in charge

581
00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:45.258
of judging people's souls?

582
00:42:45.432 --> 00:42:47.913
- Crazy. right? Are you putting
me back to work now?

583
00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:50.437
- No. I'm-- What do you mean
"back to work"?

584
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:52.091
Were you suspended?

585
00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:54.223
- It's not my fault
the guy went nuts.

586
00:42:54.397 --> 00:42:56.574
I'll tell you like
I told the other guy.

587
00:42:56.748 --> 00:42:58.488
I just sign
the recommendations.

588
00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:01.840
I don't do the paper work.

589
00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:04.146
Is that what you're calling
about. right?

590
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.714
- Well. it is. sort of.
I was his priest.

591
00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:09.630
- Okay.

592
00:43:09.804 --> 00:43:12.241
Why are you calling me?

593
00:43:12.415 --> 00:43:14.113
- Well. I was suspended too.

594
00:43:14.287 --> 00:43:17.333
I read this news story about an
RP who went on a killing spree.

595
00:43:17.507 --> 00:43:18.987
Just like my Parishioner
in Pittsburgh.

596
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:20.685
the one that you've approved.

597
00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:22.991
And they blamed the priest
and the cherub for it.

598
00:43:23.165 --> 00:43:24.819
They blamed them for everything.

599
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:27.605
- So what? You think this
gonna happen to us?

600
00:43:27.779 --> 00:43:30.259
- The priest's name was Father
Robert Flynn.

601
00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:32.000
but when I tried to look him up.

602
00:43:32.174 --> 00:43:33.175
it's like he'd been completely
wiped from the Internet.

603
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:35.047
It s like he doesn't exist.

604
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:37.615
- And that's relevant
to me? How?

605
00:43:37.789 --> 00:43:39.007
- It's really strange.
don't you think?

606
00:43:39.181 --> 00:43:41.575
It's like someone erased him.

607
00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:44.099
- You sound kind of paranoid.
Father?

608
00:43:44.273 --> 00:43:46.928
Okay. I was wondering
if in your training

609
00:43:47.102 --> 00:43:49.409
the Church ever asked you
to do anything

610
00:43:49.583 --> 00:43:51.977
beyond the realm of resurrection
recommendations?

611
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:55.807
Like to perform other duties
with your technical talents?

612
00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:57.809
- Like what?

613
00:43:57.983 --> 00:44:00.028
- Like I said. Father Flynn has
been wiped from the Internet.

614
00:44:00.202 --> 00:44:02.422
And I was hoping to find out
how it's possible.

615
00:44:02.596 --> 00:44:04.119
And I thought that
you could help me.

616
00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:05.860
- Why would you think that?

617
00:44:06.034 --> 00:44:08.080
- Cause you're a cherub.
And I'm a priest.

618
00:44:08.254 --> 00:44:10.648
And we both seek to bring
light to the darkness.

619
00:44:13.955 --> 00:44:15.565
- That sounds noble and all

620
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.785
but are you even supposed
to be talking to me?

621
00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:19.657
- I don't know. Why not?

622
00:44:19.831 --> 00:44:22.094
- So you wouldn't mind if I run
this past my boss first.

623
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.317
- Look. other cherub is listed
as being on permanent hiatus.

624
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:30.145
So. if this shakes out
the same way.

625
00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.973
you won't have to worry about
having a boss anymore.

626
00:44:36.064 --> 00:44:39.198
- Fine. Send me whatever you
have on this Father Flynn guy.

627
00:44:39.372 --> 00:44:41.504
I'll look into it.

628
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:44.856
- Yeah. thank you. My name is
Father Martin by the way.

629
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.161
- Call me Rat.

630
00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:47.859
- Rat Like the bubonic plague?

631
00:44:48.033 --> 00:44:51.689
- What? No. RAT like Remote
Access Trojan.

632
00:44:51.863 --> 00:44:53.734
- Oh. I guess it's a hacker
thing or something

633
00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:35.558
Oh. Jesus.

634
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:52.608
- Stan! I'm on my way to Rome.
can I call you back?

635
00:47:52.782 --> 00:47:54.219
- This has happened before.

636
00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:56.656
- What?
- Frank Collins.

637
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.658
He's not the first RP
to go on a killing spree.

638
00:47:58.832 --> 00:48:00.703
The dentist who started
murdering her patients.

639
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:03.097
the old man who killed
his grandkids.

640
00:48:03.271 --> 00:48:05.447
The guy who drowned
his family at the beach.

641
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:07.449
- I don't understand. Stan.

642
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:09.408
- Your Excellency.
the matter is

643
00:48:09.582 --> 00:48:12.759
Frank Collins is not the first
RP to go on a killing spree.

644
00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:14.979
You told me
that there is no protocol

645
00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:16.894
for something like this.
There have to be.

646
00:48:17.068 --> 00:48:19.070
- You're taking things
out of context.

647
00:48:19.244 --> 00:48:20.985
- There's undeniable pattern
of behavior here

648
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:23.204
- No one's denying anything.

649
00:48:23.378 --> 00:48:25.772
Yes. we've had a few RPs
who've gone astray.

650
00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:28.209
but they're human beings. Stan.

651
00:48:28.383 --> 00:48:31.604
That dentist she had some mental
illness and she stopped

652
00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:32.605
taking her medications
prescribed

653
00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:36.087
before her Resurrection.

654
00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:40.047
The grandfather had dementia
and the man at the beach.

655
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:41.962
well. he just snapped
when he discovered

656
00:48:42.136 --> 00:48:45.792
that his wife had an affair with
another man while he was dead.

657
00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:49.361
These people are flawed
and cracked.

658
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:52.320
Sometimes they bend.
sometimes they break.

659
00:48:52.494 --> 00:48:54.453
Just like you and me.

660
00:48:54.627 --> 00:48:59.632
- No. You didn't tell me
any of that before.

661
00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:01.721
- I didn't see
any connection before.

662
00:49:04.593 --> 00:49:06.682
- Am I under internal
investigation?

663
00:49:06.856 --> 00:49:10.948
- No. of course not. After the
FBI discovers the evidence...

664
00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:14.560
- Okay. so. where are
the rest of the priests?

665
00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:16.605
Are any of them still working
for the church?

666
00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:17.998
- You're getting ahead
of yourself here.

667
00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:19.478
- Then why won't you
just tell me

668
00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:21.262
what happened to the other
RP Counselors?

669
00:49:21.436 --> 00:49:24.396
Are they being mothballed.
am I next?

670
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.964
- Now. hold on.
- No. Bishop. listen to me.

671
00:49:27.138 --> 00:49:28.530
Please. just tell me
what's going on.

672
00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:30.315
If there is something sinful
happening here.

673
00:49:30.489 --> 00:49:31.707
and we don't address it now.

674
00:49:31.881 --> 00:49:32.970
it's only going to get worse.

675
00:49:33.144 --> 00:49:34.623
- That's enough.

676
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:36.669
You certainly crossed
a line here.

677
00:49:36.843 --> 00:49:38.627
Just because there are
certain things

678
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:40.499
I'm not at liberty
to share with you.

679
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:41.891
doesn't mean that there is

680
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:43.545
any kind of a cover up
or a conspiracy.

681
00:49:45.852 --> 00:49:51.249
Stan. you're beginning to slip
back into your old way of life.

682
00:49:51.423 --> 00:49:54.904
It's not good for you.
it's not good for the Church.

683
00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:57.820
and certainly not good
for your family.

684
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:01.781
Get some exercise.
get some sleep or something.

685
00:50:01.955 --> 00:50:05.480
You look terrible.
And we'll talk later.

686
00:50:40.602 --> 00:50:41.777
- Hi.

687
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:44.171
Hello. Father Flynn. this is

688
00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:46.173
- Sorry. I can't make it to my
screen at the moment.

689
00:50:46.347 --> 00:50:47.696
I'm indisposed.
Please leave a message

690
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.263
and I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

691
00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:50.786
God bless.

692
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.616
Hi. Father Flynn.

693
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:59.621
my name is Stanley Martin.
Father Stanley Martin.

694
00:50:59.795 --> 00:51:03.712
I'm calling because it's in
regards to your parishioner

695
00:51:03.886 --> 00:51:06.541
Anyway. I think we
have some commonalities

696
00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:07.629
that I'd like to discuss.

697
00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:09.109
Can you give me a call back?

698
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:10.415
I would really.
really appreciate it.

699
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.418
Okay. Thanks.

700
00:51:30.348 --> 00:51:31.914
Please. leave a message

701
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:34.091
and I will get back to you
as soon as possible.

702
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.884
Hi. this is
Father Stanley Martin.

703
00:51:45.058 --> 00:51:46.451
Stanley Martin calling.

704
00:51:46.625 --> 00:51:48.366
I'm the Father of the man
in Pittsburgh.

705
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.803
I'm calling for Father James...

706
00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:53.197
for Father Antony Russo.

707
00:51:53.371 --> 00:51:55.155
I was hoping to speak to you.

708
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:57.070
There are some commonalities
that I would like to discuss.

709
00:51:57.244 --> 00:52:00.160
And I was hoping to have
a brief conversation with you.

710
00:52:00.334 --> 00:52:01.944
If you can give me a call back

711
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.338
in the earliest convenience
I would really appreciate.

712
00:52:04.512 --> 00:52:05.513
Thank you. Thank you.

713
00:52:05.687 --> 00:52:06.949
God bless.

714
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:38.720
- Father Flynn!

715
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:42.420
Hi! I'm so glad that you
give me a call back.

716
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:43.725
- Are you one of them?

717
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:46.250
Do you know what
they're planning?

718
00:52:46.424 --> 00:52:48.034
- I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

719
00:52:48.208 --> 00:52:50.384
Did you get my message
last night?

720
00:52:50.558 --> 00:52:52.386
- Your message the RP?

721
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.127
- Yeah. That's exactly
why I called you.

722
00:52:54.301 --> 00:52:55.911
He was the parishioner
in Pittsburgh

723
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:58.436
who pushed those poor people
off the building.

724
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.394
I think there might be
some similarities

725
00:53:00.568 --> 00:53:01.439
to what happened to

726
00:53:03.615 --> 00:53:05.443
- No. no. you don't
know anything

727
00:53:05.617 --> 00:53:08.620
The frequencies have mutated.
don't you understand?

728
00:53:08.794 --> 00:53:11.884
The Huguenots tried to warn us.

729
00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:13.364
- I'm sorry Father Flynn.

730
00:53:13.538 --> 00:53:15.192
I don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.455
- No one will listen to me!

732
00:53:17.629 --> 00:53:20.371
We are running out of time.
You can't stop them.

733
00:53:20.545 --> 00:53:21.546
- Stop who?

734
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.243
- The Warriors. you fool.

735
00:53:23.417 --> 00:53:26.203
They're multiplying.
Soon they'll be everywhere.

736
00:53:27.552 --> 00:53:29.336
They're coming to silence me.

737
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:32.731
- Father. who is trying
to silence you?

738
00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:36.125
Is the Church trying
to cover something up?

739
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:40.042
Because if you have
any details at all

740
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:44.482
- They are here.
They are inside me now.

741
00:53:47.963 --> 00:53:50.314
- Father.

742
00:53:50.488 --> 00:53:52.664
What are you doing with that?

743
00:53:55.057 --> 00:53:56.929
- Father. put down the gun.

744
00:53:57.103 --> 00:53:58.539
What are you doing with that?

745
00:53:58.713 --> 00:54:00.237
Father. please stop!

746
00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:01.803
Don't! Don't do that!

747
00:54:01.977 --> 00:54:03.544
Please. put it down!

748
00:54:03.718 --> 00:54:04.893
Father Flynn. please.
put down the gun!

749
00:54:06.025 --> 00:54:07.679
- Thoughts and prayers.

750
00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:27.438
- 911. what's your emergency?

751
00:54:27.612 --> 00:54:32.356
I. I want to report
a... there's a...

752
00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.706
- I didn't get that.
What's your address?

753
00:54:47.936 --> 00:54:49.677
Fuck...

754
00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:56.118
- RAT! RAT! Your camera is on!

755
00:54:56.293 --> 00:55:01.950
- Father? What the fuck I was
trying to turn the app off

756
00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:03.561
- You turned it on instead.

757
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:06.303
But good. because
I really need to talk to you.

758
00:55:06.477 --> 00:55:10.045
- You have great timing.
Father. I'll give you that.

759
00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:14.311
We're not living in sin.
we're engaged.

760
00:55:14.485 --> 00:55:16.574
- Rat. stop!

761
00:55:16.748 --> 00:55:19.011
- At least we're engaged
to be engaged

762
00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:20.534
- Please. stop.
I need to talk to you.

763
00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:22.231
Shut up. please!

764
00:55:22.406 --> 00:55:23.929
I have to show you something.

765
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:25.757
Brace yourself.

766
00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:30.239
- Hey. are you okay. dude?
You look white as a sheet.

767
00:55:30.414 --> 00:55:35.680
- Jesus fucking shit!
Who the fuck is that?

768
00:55:35.854 --> 00:55:38.247
- That's Father Robert Flynn.

769
00:55:38.422 --> 00:55:41.250
I called him last night
and I left him a message.

770
00:55:41.425 --> 00:55:43.427
And he called me back
a few minutes ago.

771
00:55:43.601 --> 00:55:46.299
- Jesus. what the fuck did you
get me into. Father?

772
00:55:46.473 --> 00:55:48.432
- He was trying to tell me
something. right.

773
00:55:48.606 --> 00:55:50.912
But he was rambling.
it wasn't making any sense.

774
00:55:51.086 --> 00:55:53.393
Something about a plan.
said someone was after him.

775
00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:55.264
He was terrified.

776
00:55:55.439 --> 00:55:58.659
- This is some crazy shit.
Father. Did you call the cops?

777
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.010
- Not exactly

778
00:56:02.184 --> 00:56:03.925
- What does this mean?

779
00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:07.059
- Look. I need your help
figuring out what is going on.

780
00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.409
- No! No. dude. you need to call
the cops. Now!

781
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:10.889
If I call the cops

782
00:56:11.063 --> 00:56:12.412
now we'll never get access
to what he knew.

783
00:56:12.586 --> 00:56:13.935
and the police
will want to know

784
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:15.154
why was I talking
to him at the first place.

785
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.503
How did I get his number.

786
00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:17.722
Do you see where
I'm going with that?

787
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.513
- This is fucked up shit.
Father. Excuse my Latin.

788
00:56:26.687 --> 00:56:30.212
- Look. all of our computers are
connected right now. right?

789
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.866
Can't you just go in there

790
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.565
and copy his hard drive
or something?

791
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:36.567
He was scared enough
to kill himself.

792
00:56:36.741 --> 00:56:38.003
he had to know something.

793
00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:39.178
We have to figure
out what it was.

794
00:56:39.352 --> 00:56:41.746
- No. We definitely don't.

795
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.662
- Look. I know you don't wanna
be involved in this.

796
00:56:45.706 --> 00:56:47.752
but you are. okay?

797
00:56:47.926 --> 00:56:51.495
And I can't do this alone.
Please.

798
00:56:51.669 --> 00:56:54.019
I'm gonna share my screen
with you.

799
00:56:54.193 --> 00:56:56.978
- Fine. Whatever.

800
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.855
- Oh. is this gonna
leave a trace?

801
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:06.727
Don't worry. I'm gonna delete
any trace of this being here.

802
00:57:06.901 --> 00:57:07.859
All right. Count to three.

803
00:57:08.033 --> 00:57:09.164
- Why?

804
00:57:09.338 --> 00:57:10.775
- Just do it.

805
00:57:10.949 --> 00:57:13.212
- One. two. three

806
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.740
- Whoa

807
00:57:22.917 --> 00:57:24.963
- You know. this is really
messed up.

808
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:34.102
Right. I'm in his hard drive

809
00:57:34.276 --> 00:57:37.236
and I'm erasing you
from his call log.

810
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:40.718
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. Literally.

811
00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.594
Done.

812
00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:50.118
- Okay. let's go
through the drive.

813
00:57:50.292 --> 00:57:51.468
- No. Father. definitely not.

814
00:57:51.642 --> 00:57:53.382
I'm gonna go through
his drive myself

815
00:57:53.557 --> 00:57:54.427
and I'll let you know
if I find anything.

816
00:57:54.601 --> 00:57:56.560
- What? No. that's not what.

817
00:57:56.734 --> 00:57:58.387
I'm not arguing with you.

818
00:57:58.562 --> 00:58:01.173
I work better without someone
looking over my shoulder.

819
00:58:01.347 --> 00:58:03.218
There is something
and I will find it.

820
00:58:03.392 --> 00:58:05.525
But what you'll be looking for?

821
00:58:05.699 --> 00:58:08.702
- Trust me. I'm a cherub.

822
00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:12.053
It's my job to find things
people don't want to be found.

823
00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:14.012
- Fine. How long
is it gonna take?

824
00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:17.058
- Take a pill.
I'll let you know.

825
00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:30.697
- Hey

826
00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.657
- Jesus. were you in a fight?

827
00:59:33.831 --> 00:59:35.572
No. I haven't been
sleeping very well.

828
00:59:35.746 --> 00:59:36.747
What'd you find?

829
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:41.099
- I didn't find anything.

830
00:59:41.273 --> 00:59:42.709
- What?

831
00:59:42.883 --> 00:59:44.624
That's impossible.

832
00:59:44.798 --> 00:59:47.758
Did you check everything?
Emails?

833
00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:49.368
Did you check everywhere
on the computer?

834
00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:50.717
Hidden directories? Chats?

835
00:59:52.023 --> 00:59:53.720
- I checked everything.
Father.

836
00:59:53.894 --> 00:59:56.375
I went through his drive.
Twice. It's clean.

837
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:58.725
There is not a single suspicious
file or folder on it...

838
00:59:58.899 --> 01:00:01.162
- Do it again. check the cloud
or something. I don't know.

839
01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.642
- I checked everything.

840
01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.122
I even hacked into Bishop
Hill's drive.

841
01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:06.037
There is nothing there.

842
01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:07.734
There are no conspiracies.
no cover-ups.

843
01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:10.476
These are the most boring drives
I've ever hacked.

844
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:15.220
This whole thing. dude.
is a dead end.

845
01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:19.616
Are you okay?
You look kinda hungover.

846
01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:22.749
- I'm not.

847
01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:25.143
- You can't lie to
a cherub. Father.

848
01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:28.494
- Father Flynn. he wouldn't just
kill himself like that. right?

849
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:31.715
He specifically called me.
It was

850
01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.542
He was trying
to tell me something.

851
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.632
He was making a statement.

852
01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:37.372
- Maybe he felt guilty
about what happened

853
01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:38.373
to his Parishioner.

854
01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:40.419
I don't know...

855
01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.769
Sometimes people snap
for no reason.

856
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:46.425
It's a good thing that
we didn't find anything. right?

857
01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:48.993
Because that means there is
nothing to worry about.

858
01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:58.045
- Look. Father.
I did some reading on you.

859
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:04.312
You forgot to mention that your
son is Nicholas Martin.

860
01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:07.141
- What's your point?

861
01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:08.882
- My point is.

862
01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:13.670
I get why you're so sensitive
about this RP stuff.

863
01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:17.369
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

864
01:01:17.543 --> 01:01:21.895
But dude. getting wasted
isn't helping.

865
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:24.245
- You don't know what you're
talking about. right?

866
01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.465
I don't know if you're doing
this to punish yourself

867
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:28.032
because of what happened
to your son.

868
01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:30.469
or if you're one of those
regular old drunks.

869
01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:33.385
but you need
to put the bottle down.

870
01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:35.692
It's messing with your head.

871
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:38.390
- I didn't imagine any of this!

872
01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:42.046
- I know. You didn't.
Shit happens.

873
01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.525
- Dude. the world
is a crazy place

874
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.832
but that's why people
need the Church.

875
01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:48.095
To help make sense
out of all of it.

876
01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:50.881
You have an eccentric priest
who commits suicide.

877
01:01:51.055 --> 01:01:52.665
You have someone
that you're counseling

878
01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:54.536
and they do something terrible.

879
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.236
That's just life on Earth.

880
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.151
It's messy.

881
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:11.249
- You know. I still think we
should've called the cops.

882
01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:14.556
But I guess it's too late
for that now.

883
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.776
And I'm serious about the booze.

884
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.952
- Thank you.

885
01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.041
- I'm supposed to report
on stuff like this.

886
01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:23.130
But I'm gonna let it side

887
01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:26.525
because of what
you've been through.

888
01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:32.096
But you've got a problem.
I know the signs.

889
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:34.533
You don't want to dig
yourself into a hole

890
01:02:34.707 --> 01:02:36.840
you can't get out of.

891
01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:40.757
- Yeah. well. you and I both
know a priest has to do

892
01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:44.543
something really bad
not to get resurrected.

893
01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:47.894
- Maybe it's this life you
should be worried about.

894
01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:54.858
Look. I gotta go.

895
01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:59.906
But I am here if you need
to talk to somebody. okay?

896
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:08.785
- Yeah.
- And. Rat. just...thank you.

897
01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:14.442
- Don't mention it.

898
01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:18.795
I guess you can't this time.
Whatever. Bye.

899
01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:30.284
Hi. Stan. um

900
01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:35.246
Listen. I've been
thinking over and well.

901
01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.989
I figured maybe you wanna come
here on Easter Sunday.

902
01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:42.035
Maybe you could give
the Blessing.

903
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:45.430
I know Nicky would be really
thrilled to see you. so um

904
01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:47.171
Yeah. I just wanna let you know

905
01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:48.912
that you are more than welcome
to join if you want.

906
01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:52.219
It's at 10 a.m.

907
01:03:52.393 --> 01:03:55.788
And also I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

908
01:03:55.962 --> 01:03:59.444
I know. all of this cannot be
easy for you.

909
01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:04.536
So. I didn't mean for this
message to be so long.

910
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.365
Let me know if you can make it.
Bye.

911
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.606
- Stan.

912
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.173
- Your Excellency. good morning.

913
01:05:16.347 --> 01:05:18.392
Do you have some time for me?

914
01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:20.264
- How are we feeling
this morning?

915
01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:22.353
- To be honest. I'm feeling
a little bit embarrassed

916
01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:24.442
about my behavior
the other night.

917
01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:29.273
You were absolutely correct
and I hope you'll forgive me.

918
01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:32.276
I'm very happy
to hear that. Stan.

919
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:34.321
And of course I forgive you.

920
01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:37.455
You're a very important member
of this Diocese.

921
01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:39.109
And I understand.

922
01:05:39.283 --> 01:05:40.675
everybody is under
a great deal of stress.

923
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:42.982
especially with the incident
in Pittsburgh.

924
01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:47.726
But actually. Stan. I have some
good news for you.

925
01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.858
- Huh?

926
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.773
- I just heard back
from the FBI.

927
01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.514
They finished their
investigation

928
01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:56.039
and you're cleared
to return to work.

929
01:05:56.213 --> 01:05:57.779
Really?

930
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.652
- Stan. everybody knew you had
nothing to do with this.

931
01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:03.350
- What was the determination?

932
01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.004
- It sounds like
Mr. Collins had

933
01:06:05.178 --> 01:06:08.442
a rather violent
criminal history

934
01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:11.532
and this was pre-Resurrection
and somehow

935
01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:14.622
he managed to hide that
from the Cherubim.

936
01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:19.279
- But I thought the Cherubim
never missed anything?

937
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:21.716
- Don't be naive. Stan.

938
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:25.068
There are plenty of ways to hide
sinful behavior.

939
01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.984
I mean those encrypted servers.
there is retro-tech

940
01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:31.813
and that's just for the sins
people commit online.

941
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:35.382
There is no true way
to judge a soul.

942
01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:39.952
All we can hope is to convince
them enough to behave.

943
01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:42.128
- So...

944
01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:44.217
What's gonna happen
to the Cherub

945
01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:47.307
that approved Frank
for Resurrection?

946
01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:51.398
- I'm afraid I can't
talk about that.

947
01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.357
- I'm sure that
they did their best.

948
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.445
Hope they won't
be disciplined.

949
01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:57.361
- Stan. please. just relax.

950
01:06:57.535 --> 01:07:00.190
This is good news.
It's all good.

951
01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:01.887
And if you're up to it.

952
01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:05.064
you can come back to work
as soon as you want.

953
01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:11.375
- That that would be great.
And um. Nicky?

954
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:14.682
- Nicholas?
Call him whenever you like.

955
01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:21.080
- Thank you. Thank you. Bishop.
I am indebted to you.

956
01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.647
- You're welcome. Stan.

957
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:26.781
Now. get out there
and harvest more souls.

958
01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:28.609
- All right.

959
01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.440
- Gotta tell you. Rose. sounds
like things are going

960
01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:35.181
really well these days?

961
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:37.705
- Yeah. At first I was worried
he was only into me

962
01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:40.012
because I'm the only other RP
in school.

963
01:07:40.186 --> 01:07:43.233
but we actually have
like a lot in common.

964
01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:46.932
Plus he's popular and now all
his friends are my friends.

965
01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:48.977
You're too much!

966
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:51.676
- What about you. Father?

967
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.548
Sometimes I just feel weird
talking about myself so much.

968
01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:57.508
- That's okay. that's why
I'm here. To listen.

969
01:07:57.682 --> 01:08:01.294
- I know. but I don't know
anything about you.

970
01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:03.601
Do you priests have the same
kinds of problems

971
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.168
as normal people?

972
01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.996
- Oh yeah! Priests are
just normal people.

973
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.609
Most of us.

974
01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:14.307
Actually. I always have felt
that God takes

975
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:17.310
those truly broken souls and
makes them his priests.

976
01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:19.921
We have the most to learn.

977
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.402
- That's sort of beautiful.
In a sad way.

978
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:30.932
- You know. years ago
I hurt someone.

979
01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.935
In the most painful way
imaginable.

980
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:35.676
And they couldn't forgive me.

981
01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:38.288
I couldn't forgive myself even
after I became a priest.

982
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.334
which is not how
it is supposed to work.

983
01:08:43.423 --> 01:08:46.122
But um...recently that person
invited me back in her life

984
01:08:47.862 --> 01:08:50.082
and it's a step
in the right direction.

985
01:08:52.084 --> 01:08:53.738
Is it TMI?

986
01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:56.088
- No. thank you for
sharing that with me.

987
01:08:56.262 --> 01:09:01.659
I think. in a way. Judgment day
is every day.

988
01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:04.183
Don't you think?

989
01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:08.405
- Yeah. well. the penitent
comforting the confessor.

990
01:09:10.668 --> 01:09:13.410
- I like that.
Maybe I could be a priest.

991
01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.941
- Okay. Rose. that's our time.

992
01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:24.551
- Thank you. Father.

993
01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.640
- It was great to see you.

994
01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:27.859
- You too.

995
01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:38.130
- Hey. Chris!

996
01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:43.135
- Hello. Father!

997
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:44.658
- Oh. God.

998
01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.660
Chris. what have you done?

999
01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:49.272
- Don't worry. Father. We have
a cleaning lady every Tuesday.

1000
01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:53.145
- Chris. listen to me!
Are any of them alive?

1001
01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:56.670
If they need medical attention.
I might help

1002
01:09:56.844 --> 01:10:00.021
- Alive? None of them were ever
truly alive. Father.

1003
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.850
But we're changing that.

1004
01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:05.984
Soon everyone will wake up and
learn what life is really about.

1005
01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:10.075
- Why? Why?

1006
01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:12.686
- You don't understand. Father.

1007
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.255
Once they see what we've seen.
they'll be grateful.

1008
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:18.953
They'll thank us.
You'll all thank us.

1009
01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:22.870
- Listen to me. Chris.
I'm calling the police. right?

1010
01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:24.829
You need to put the knife down.

1011
01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:29.050
- Sorry. Father. I can't do
that. I'm just getting started.

1012
01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.924
No. no. not again!

1013
01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:36.319
- 911. what's your emergency?

1014
01:10:36.493 --> 01:10:38.277
- Hi. my name is
Father Stanley Martin.

1015
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.192
A man just attacked his family.

1016
01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:42.020
I don't know if they're alive
or they're dead.

1017
01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:44.936
I think he's planning on hurting
more people. okay?

1018
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:49.245
His name is Chris Silva.
You need to... get an ambulance!

1019
01:10:49.419 --> 01:10:51.247
- Do you have an address?

1020
01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:57.905
- Okay. 30 Sherwood Avenue.
White Plains. New York.

1021
01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.342
- I don't place your call

1022
01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:01.213
anywhere near
that location. Sir.

1023
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:03.128
- No. I was over a video chat
with him. I'm his counselor.

1024
01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:05.652
I could see it all
on the background.

1025
01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.264
There was blood everywhere.
there were

1026
01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:10.135
You need to send them
an ambulance right now!

1027
01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:13.791
- All right. Sir. Don't worry.
I'm dispatching units right now.

1028
01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:15.793
Can I get an exact

1029
01:11:33.985 --> 01:11:35.769
- Father Martin.

1030
01:11:35.943 --> 01:11:37.118
- Another one of my parishioners
just went on a killing spree.

1031
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.729
- What?

1032
01:11:38.903 --> 01:11:40.470
- Okay. I already called it in
to the police.

1033
01:11:40.644 --> 01:11:42.341
I call you for a different
reason. right?

1034
01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:44.169
I think this parishioner and
my parishioner in Pittsburgh.

1035
01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:46.127
I think that they're connected.

1036
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.174
I think that Church might be
hiding something

1037
01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:53.134
I don't Look. Bishop Hill was...

1038
01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.659
- Listen. I didn't trust him
from the beginning.

1039
01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.182
- You didn't?

1040
01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:59.576
- No. Listen. he hasn't been
truthful with me

1041
01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.665
and I just knew
something wasn't right.

1042
01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:03.841
There is something
shady going on.

1043
01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:05.843
- Thank God. I was afraid
no one's gonna believe me.

1044
01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:08.149
- Listen to me. Where are you
now? Are you some place safe?

1045
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.934
- Yeah. I'm home.

1046
01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:12.371
- Okay. good. Stay where you are
and don't call anyone.

1047
01:12:12.545 --> 01:12:16.027
I'll make a quick phone call
and I'll be right back.

1048
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:18.421
Until I do do not talk
to anyone.

1049
01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:34.088
Shit!

1050
01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:42.967
Hey. this is Rat.
Leave a message

1051
01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:44.534
and if I like
what you have to say

1052
01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:46.840
I'll call you back. Or not.

1053
01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.539
Rat. it's me.
Something happened.

1054
01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:51.497
You gotta call me.
It's urgent.

1055
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:54.370
All right. Just I'll be there
waiting for your call. right?

1056
01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:15.695
- Hey. Dad.

1057
01:13:15.869 --> 01:13:19.090
- Hey. Nicky. Is you mom here?
Gotta talk to her.

1058
01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:20.874
- She is busy.

1059
01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:22.398
- Well. tell her
it's really important.

1060
01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.225
- Yeah.

1061
01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:31.232
Mom. Dad wants to talk to you.
Says it's very important.

1062
01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:37.804
Sorry. but...

1063
01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:39.502
- She's escorting Bishop Hill

1064
01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:42.287
out of the house.
so she can't talk right now.

1065
01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:45.464
- Oh yeah? How often is Bishop
Hill at the house?

1066
01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:51.601
- Um. he's been here
a few times. Why?

1067
01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:53.603
- You know. you can tell me
anything. right?

1068
01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:55.039
I mean anything.

1069
01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:57.520
- Yeah. of course.

1070
01:13:57.694 --> 01:14:01.001
- Tell your mom to call me
as soon as she can. right?

1071
01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:03.830
- Yeah. sure.

1072
01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:06.877
But you're coming to the Easter
party tomorrow. right?

1073
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:10.533
- Yeah. yeah. I'm not gonna miss
it for the world.

1074
01:14:10.707 --> 01:14:12.143
- I love you. Dad.

1075
01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.667
- I love you too. son.

1076
01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:17.017
- Bye.

1077
01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:44.828
- Hey. Father.
Watch out!

1078
01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:51.312
Hey! Hey. stop it! Leave him
alone! I'm calling the cops!

1079
01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:01.714
- Hello. hi. no.
I need someone right now!

1080
01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:04.935
99 Beam Street 6th floor.
She is trying to kill him.

1081
01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:06.676
Fuck!

1082
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.983
Stop! Get the fuck out of there!

1083
01:15:10.157 --> 01:15:12.986
I'm recording. You will not
get away with this.

1084
01:15:15.423 --> 01:15:18.688
Fuck off! I'm serious!

1085
01:15:21.473 --> 01:15:24.258
Leave him alone!

1086
01:15:28.132 --> 01:15:29.960
Oh. fuck!

1087
01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:32.049
Oh my God!
Come on. come on!

1088
01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:36.488
Oh my God. oh my God!
I killed her.

1089
01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:39.447
Why were you doing that?

1090
01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:45.584
- Rat?

1091
01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:48.544
That's special agent Ortiz.
head of the RP Unit.

1092
01:15:48.718 --> 01:15:50.807
- Dude! You just killed
an FBI agent?

1093
01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:53.853
- She didn't give me
a choice. did she?

1094
01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:56.856
Right before that I called
Ortiz and told her everything.

1095
01:15:57.030 --> 01:16:00.425
Two minutes later she is in my
apartment trying to kill me.

1096
01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:02.949
- She was already there.

1097
01:16:03.123 --> 01:16:05.952
- She's been outside watching
me. To see how much I know.

1098
01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:10.522
- So. this is a conspiracy
between the Church and the FBI?

1099
01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.395
- Shit!

1100
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.572
So. I sort of maybe
called the cops

1101
01:16:16.746 --> 01:16:19.357
when it looked like you were
being murdered.

1102
01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:21.054
You may not want to be there
when they show up.

1103
01:16:21.228 --> 01:16:23.013
It was self-defense!

1104
01:16:23.187 --> 01:16:24.536
- I don't think that matters.

1105
01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.236
- Yeah. Yeah. point taken.

1106
01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.156
I will call you. As soon as I
get the chance.

1107
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:38.985
- Okay. Leave.

1108
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.822
Search the rooms.

1109
01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:02.008
Law enforcement officers
have put out

1110
01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:04.489
an all-points bulletin for
Father Stanley Martin.

1111
01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:07.579
Martin is wanted for questioning
in the murder of an FBI agent

1112
01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.929
who was found dead
in his home earlier today.

1113
01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:18.546
- Oh Father. thank God.
I thought the cops got you.

1114
01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:19.591
Where are you right now?

1115
01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:22.420
- I'm in an Internet café.

1116
01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.074
- Do they still exist?

1117
01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:26.511
- Apparently. I'm using one
of the computers.

1118
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:29.383
I thought that the feds might be
tracking my phone.

1119
01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:31.516
- That is smart move.

1120
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.300
You're everywhere on the news.

1121
01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:36.390
the cops put out a dragnet
for you. Look. check it out.

1122
01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:39.219
I did some digging on that FBI
agent and it turns out

1123
01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:42.440
she was killed on the job and
resurrected three years ago.

1124
01:17:42.614 --> 01:17:44.181
- Yeah. makes sense
that the Bureau

1125
01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:46.096
would put an RP in charge
of the RP Unit.

1126
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.794
- Yeah. except that when your
first parishioner went nuts.

1127
01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:50.927
she said he had history
of violence.

1128
01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:53.277
which I know isn't true
because I'm the one

1129
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:55.322
who recommended him
for Resurrection.

1130
01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:58.238
I don't make those kinds
of mistakes.

1131
01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:01.851
- So. she's not investigating RP
crimes. she's covering them up.

1132
01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.504
That's why she wanted
the recordings

1133
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.550
of my sessions with Frank.

1134
01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:08.509
To see if he told me anything
I wasn't supposed to know.

1135
01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.381
- Like what?

1136
01:18:10.555 --> 01:18:13.166
- Iguess that's what we
have to figure out.

1137
01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.387
- Okay well then. check this
out.

1138
01:18:16.561 --> 01:18:20.652
- I hacked into the FBI server
and I got Agent Ortiz's drive.

1139
01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.828
I figured if anyone had
evidence about what's

1140
01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:24.177
going on it's
gotta be her.

1141
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:27.746
- You hacked the FBI?

1142
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.574
- Chill. Father.
It's not that big a deal.

1143
01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:32.403
their cyber security isn't even
as good as the Church's.

1144
01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:34.448
Here. take a look.

1145
01:18:34.622 --> 01:18:36.581
If you click "Case files" and
then go over to "Closed cases".

1146
01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:40.237
you're gonna see all the info
that Agent Ortiz had on your
RPs.

1147
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:44.371
And all of Father Flynn's. plus
every RP she's ever
investigated ever.

1148
01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:46.330
- So if we figure out what
these RPs had in common.

1149
01:18:46.504 --> 01:18:48.245
maybe we'll figure out
what's going on.

1150
01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.814
What are you doing?

1151
01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:53.467
I'm writing a script

1152
01:18:53.641 --> 01:18:55.034
that will cross-reference
multiple documents

1153
01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:57.167
and look for identical
character sequences.

1154
01:18:58.951 --> 01:19:00.605
- Yeah. of course. you are.

1155
01:19:01.432 --> 01:19:02.999
- Jackpot!

1156
01:19:03.173 --> 01:19:04.130
- What? What you got?

1157
01:19:04.304 --> 01:19:05.915
- It's in the web histories.

1158
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:09.657
The both RPs frequented
the same URL. A lot.

1159
01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:11.703
- Okay. what's the website?

1160
01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:13.270
It's a dark web chat forum.

1161
01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:19.232
Um Warriors-Of-
Enlightenment-dot-RP.

1162
01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:21.887
- That's what Father Flynn was
ranting about. The Warriors.

1163
01:19:22.061 --> 01:19:23.584
That's who he said
had to be stopped.

1164
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.761
- Okay. I'm gonna share
my screen with you.

1165
01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.850
Because you cannot log into
the dark web

1166
01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:28.764
from an internet café.

1167
01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:31.157
Okay.

1168
01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:33.464
You see it?

1169
01:19:33.638 --> 01:19:35.074
- It's password protected?

1170
01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:37.076
- Yeah. and not for long.

1171
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:41.864
- What's wrong?

1172
01:19:42.038 --> 01:19:44.910
- Damn. These servers are more
secure than the FBI's.

1173
01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:47.347
Oh. thank you.

1174
01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:50.089
- Father. are you drinking
alcohol right now?

1175
01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.485
- If Ortiz was protecting people

1176
01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:56.922
using this website
maybe she was a user too.

1177
01:19:57.096 --> 01:19:58.315
Can you see if
she's got her password

1178
01:19:58.489 --> 01:19:59.969
saved somewhere on her drive?

1179
01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:04.321
- Hey. Father. I'll make
a hacker out of you. yet.

1180
01:20:13.373 --> 01:20:15.071
- Got it!

1181
01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:25.646
We have waited a long time.
We have shown great discipline.

1182
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.649
We must resist the temptation
to begin our work prematurely

1183
01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:38.311
We found another LARPer on the
site. another Judas taken down.

1184
01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:40.139
Remember. the Church is
a House of False Prophets.

1185
01:20:40.313 --> 01:20:42.054
and that House will crumble.

1186
01:20:42.228 --> 01:20:45.101
But if we are exposed we will
have failed in our crusade.

1187
01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:47.407
- What is this?

1188
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:49.279
- Well. if I know
anything about cults.

1189
01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:50.846
it sounds like one of those.

1190
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.851
Am I the only one worried

1191
01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:58.027
we're just going to get arrested
after Resurrection Day?

1192
01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:03.597
- Wait. scroll
to the top comment.

1193
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.954
That's exactly what Chris Silva
said. That they'll be grateful.

1194
01:21:12.128 --> 01:21:14.478
- Shit Check this one out.

1195
01:21:14.652 --> 01:21:16.262
Hey fellow Warriors.

1196
01:21:16.436 --> 01:21:18.090
I don't have any family
to save on Resurrection Day.

1197
01:21:18.264 --> 01:21:21.180
so I think I'll go out and save
as many souls as I can.

1198
01:21:21.354 --> 01:21:23.139
Does anyone have advice on how

1199
01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:24.923
I can maximize the number of
kills. before someone stops me?

1200
01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:28.274
- This is it. Rat! They're
talking about mass murder.

1201
01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:35.107
- Shit!

1202
01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:38.502
It looks like Agent Ortiz has
administrative privileges too.

1203
01:21:38.676 --> 01:21:41.809
Or had. I guess.

1204
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:45.901
I guess. Well. I think
this comment is about you.

1205
01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:55.911
- They've been
planning this for years

1206
01:21:58.652 --> 01:22:01.003
- Shit!

1207
01:22:01.177 --> 01:22:02.395
They're hacking
data encryption programs

1208
01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:04.354
and tracking people's
activity.

1209
01:22:04.528 --> 01:22:05.921
They're planning
to release everything

1210
01:22:06.095 --> 01:22:08.227
anyone's ever done
on the dark web.

1211
01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:23.939
That's Matthew 3:10

1212
01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:26.811
They don't want any sinners
coming back.

1213
01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.205
They weaponized resurrection.

1214
01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:34.471
Matthew 3.11.
It's baptism by fire.

1215
01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:37.082
- It's a mass murder flash mob.

1216
01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:40.781
- Hey. up in
the right corner. you see?

1217
01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.610
That little clock symbol.
Can you click on that?

1218
01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:45.177
- Yeah.

1219
01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:51.270
- 4 hours until ceremony?
What ceremony?

1220
01:22:51.444 --> 01:22:54.970
- It's Easter.
It's Christ's Resurrection.

1221
01:22:55.144 --> 01:22:57.450
Nicky He's got a party
at 10 a.m.

1222
01:22:57.624 --> 01:22:59.235
I've got to know
if he's involved.

1223
01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:01.672
Can you run a global search
on the website?

1224
01:23:01.846 --> 01:23:03.848
Tell me if my son's name
is mentioned anywhere.

1225
01:23:04.022 --> 01:23:05.415
Hey. his name is Nicholas.

1226
01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:07.852
- I know who he is.

1227
01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.550
Nothing. He's not
listed anywhere.

1228
01:23:10.724 --> 01:23:13.597
- Okay. I need to tell Audrey
to cancel the party anyway.

1229
01:23:13.771 --> 01:23:16.730
So they do know.

1230
01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:19.733
- Wait. shit! Okay. okay!
That gives me an idea

1231
01:23:34.879 --> 01:23:38.448
- Wait. Wait. hold on. Do you
think that's a good idea?

1232
01:23:38.622 --> 01:23:40.580
Shit!

1233
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.161
- Wait! What if they already
know that's not true?

1234
01:23:56.335 --> 01:23:58.294
- What if it is true?
You got a better idea?

1235
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:08.043
Fuck it!

1236
01:24:08.217 --> 01:24:09.609
- Write something!

1237
01:24:09.783 --> 01:24:11.916
- Okay! Okay!

1238
01:24:46.472 --> 01:24:47.952
Make them stop!

1239
01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:49.649
Got you!

1240
01:24:49.823 --> 01:24:51.477
I'm sorry. Father.

1241
01:24:51.651 --> 01:24:52.652
These guys are gonna be
on your ass in a few minutes.

1242
01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:54.741
Oh yeah!

1243
01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:56.874
- Okay. what about you?

1244
01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:58.441
- My IP is encrypted.

1245
01:24:58.615 --> 01:25:00.356
I'm gonna see if I can
get back into the forum.

1246
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:02.836
If I can.
I can try to get evidence

1247
01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:04.751
of what they're doing

1248
01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.579
and I can make an anonymous
drop to the media.

1249
01:25:06.753 --> 01:25:09.539
- Maybe they can warn the public
- No. no. no!

1250
01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.410
Holy fucking shit!

1251
01:25:11.584 --> 01:25:13.064

Where did he go?

1262
01:26:12.558 --> 01:26:14.647
Let's see if we can cut him off
at the other end.

1263
01:26:45.156 --> 01:26:48.072
- Father. thank God! I've been
waiting for your call all night.

1264
01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:50.248
- I had to steal a phone.
I broke the seventh commandment

1265
01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:53.033
- I'll let it slide.
Are you okay?

1266

- No! Now we have
fifteen minutes.

1267

Did you send everything
to the media?

1268
01:26:56.776 --> 01:26:58.517
- I found a way back
into the forum.

1269
01:26:58.691 --> 01:27:00.693
I'm downloading all the proof
that we need.

1270
01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:02.782
But what about your son?
Is he okay?

1271

- I don't know yet.
I just got here.

1272
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.873
There are two cops
around the house.

1273
01:27:07.047 --> 01:27:08.658
I guess they're expecting me.
Anything you can do?

1274
01:27:08.832 --> 01:27:11.748

Through Him. with Him.

and then we will be
all caught up. okay?

1299
01:28:36.223 --> 01:28:37.964
- Did Bishop ever tell you about
the Warriors of Enlightenment?

1300
01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:39.662
You need to tell me.

1301
01:28:39.836 --> 01:28:43.143
- It is about wonderment.
not warriors. come on!

1302
01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.711
- Please. tell me.
I need you to focus.

1303
01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:48.279
Stan!

1304
01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:49.846

No. no. no! Stop!

1310
01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:05.209
- You smell like beer. Have
you... have you been drinking?

1311
01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:08.386
- This isn't about drinking.
It wasn't about drinking then.

1312
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.170
and it's not about drinking now!

1313
01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.956
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't listen to me

1314
01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.827
- I have tried!

1315
01:29:16.089 --> 01:29:17.917
- Please! You're in danger!

1316
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.790
- We are in danger from you!

Goddamn it!

1319

Look at yourself! Look at how
you're scaring your son!

1320
01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:36.719
I want you out of my house.

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:49.471

Yes. we are safe!

1325
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.996
Get out!

01:29:56.565 --> 01:29:58.218
I just sent out all the data.

1327
01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.612
Hopefully. they'll start warning
the public within an hour.

1328
01:30:00.786 --> 01:30:02.005
Did you make it?

1329
01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:08.315
- Um Yeah. they're fine.

1330
01:30:10.013 --> 01:30:11.928
- What was that?

1331
01:30:12.102 --> 01:30:15.148
- Listen to me. Sounds like
gunfire. Let me check it out.

1332
01:30:15.322 --> 01:30:16.541
- Please. be careful.

1333
01:30:16.715 --> 01:30:17.803

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.782
- Please. Father!

1341
01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:25.697

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.897
upwards of
a half million people

who call themselves the Warriors
of Enlightenment.

1365
01:33:23.815 --> 01:33:25.121
the Vatican announced
it will be

1366
01:33:25.295 --> 01:33:27.427
opening seven
new Resurrection Centers

1367
01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:29.778
to help expedite what will be

1368
01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:31.910
a long and logistically
challenging process...

1369
01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:33.608
Though it is
unclear how many

1370
01:33:33.782 --> 01:33:35.653
of those killed
will qualify for Resurrection

1371
01:33:35.827 --> 01:33:38.134
after the data caches
of several

1372
01:33:38.308 --> 01:33:40.789
dark web encryption programs
were made public.

1373
01:33:40.963 --> 01:33:44.009
ousting countless clergy
and civilians alike.

1374
01:33:44.183 --> 01:33:46.969
and prompting worldwide calls
for more relaxed standards

1375
01:33:47.143 --> 01:33:50.886
and transparency
in resurrection protocols...

1376
01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.976
One of the main organizers of
the Warriors of Enlightenment

1377
01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:57.022
was none other than Father
Stanley Martin.

1378
01:33:57.196 --> 01:33:59.372
wanted in connection for
the murder of an FBI agent

1379
01:33:59.546 --> 01:34:03.072
just hours before he poisoned
a house full of worshippers.

1380
01:34:03.246 --> 01:34:06.553
killing all involved
including his ex-wife.

1381
01:34:06.728 --> 01:34:10.601
His son Nicholas Martin. the
very first Resurrected Person.

1382
01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:13.473
was uninjured in the attack.

1383
01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:15.780
Nicholas Martin has been
sequestered in a location

1384
01:34:15.954 --> 01:34:19.349
inside the Vatican
out of harm's way.

1385
01:34:19.523 --> 01:34:22.613
All requests for interviews
have been denied at this time.

1386
01:34:22.787 --> 01:34:24.876
While Father Martin's crimes
disqualified him

1387
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.530
from being resurrected himself.

1388
01:34:26.704 --> 01:34:28.401
more and more people
are protesting

1389
01:34:28.575 --> 01:34:29.925
against being resurrected
in general.

1390
01:34:30.099 --> 01:34:33.885
We're all sinners.
every last one of us.

1391
01:34:34.059 --> 01:34:35.800
So why are we allowing
the Church

1392
01:34:35.974 --> 01:34:37.236
to take control
of our lives?

1393
01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:38.890
The Church will
do well to remember

1394
01:34:39.064 --> 01:34:40.979
that sins are meant to be
forgiven. not punished.

1395
01:34:41.153 --> 01:34:43.982
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

1396
01:34:45.418 --> 01:34:47.290
I don't see any stones here.

1397
01:34:47.464 --> 01:34:49.031
The tragedy that
befell us on Easter

1398
01:34:49.205 --> 01:34:50.989
had nothing to do with these
people being Resurrected.

1399
01:34:51.163 --> 01:34:53.209
Not every RP was a part of this.

1400
01:34:53.383 --> 01:34:57.082
This was simply a group of
misguided impressionable souls

1401
01:34:57.256 --> 01:35:00.433
who fell prey to the words
of false prophets.

1402
01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:02.348
There is no reason that these
victims were disqualified

1403
01:35:02.522 --> 01:35:04.568
and were not given
the second chance.

1404
01:35:04.742 --> 01:35:07.614
to live long and healthy lives.

1405
01:35:07.789 --> 01:35:10.617
- Cardinal. Is the Church
willing to accept responsibility

1406
01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.271
for what resurrected people do

1407
01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:14.709
with those second chances
you're giving them?

1408
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:19.931
- The Church has taken
responsibility for sinners

1409
01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:21.803
for thousands of years.

1410
01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:23.935
And we are not about stop now.

1411
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:27.591
Admittedly. mistakes were made.
perhaps some hubris.

1412
01:35:27.765 --> 01:35:29.898
but these mistakes

1413
01:35:30.072 --> 01:35:33.858
are all part of man's
imperfection. isn't that so?

1414
01:35:34.032 --> 01:35:37.340
We learn from out mistakes
and we strive to do better.

1415
01:35:37.514 --> 01:35:39.385
That is God's will.

1416
01:35:39.559 --> 01:35:41.474
But to deny the miracle
of Resurrection

1417
01:35:41.648 --> 01:35:45.478
simply because some people did
some bad things...

1418
01:35:45.652 --> 01:35:48.133
No. this is not God's will.

1419
01:35:48.307 --> 01:35:49.569
- But even now the Church

1420
01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.876
refuses to divulge
the true nature

1421
01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:53.617
of what you call a miracle.

1422
01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:55.619
How can the public trust
something

1423
01:35:55.793 --> 01:35:57.316
when they have no concept of

1424
01:35:57.490 --> 01:35:59.449
how it even works or what it is?

1425
01:35:59.623 --> 01:36:04.584
- Well. that's the point
of a miracle. isn't it?

1426
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:06.630
You've got to have faith.
