186
00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.372
You can't sit there.

187
00:11:57.372 --> 00:11:58.539
- Yeah?
- Okay.

188
00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:13.413
(suspenseful music)

189
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.610
- Trey Bell pronounced dead at the scene.

190
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.712
sustained five gunshots center mass.

191
00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:24.970
Your shots were fired

192
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.310
when the deceased ignored
several warnings shouted out

193
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.643
and pulled out a six
round 38 caliber firearm.

194
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.170
Found on the deceased were a pack of gum.

195
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.760
backpack with some notebooks.
keys. and a cell phone.

196
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.540
The gun was taken to police forensics.

197
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.710
It was found to have not been fired.

198
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.390
The serial number had been filed off

199
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.803
and it could not be traced.

200
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.560
- This material was all
brought up at the hearing.

201
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.210
Why is it being brought up again?

202
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.560
- As you were aware. detective.

203
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.840
the court has acquitted
you on all charges.

204
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.050
However. as the disciplinary board.

205
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.690
we have our own set of guidelines

206
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.213
and standards to follow
in situations like this.

207
00:13:04.213 --> 00:13:05.810
- It's the board's decision

208
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.250
you be placed on paid
psychiatric leave for six months.

209
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.290
When you return to work.

210
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.333
you'll be assigned to
administrative duties for 12 months.

211
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.053
- No. I did nothing wrong.

212
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.210
I'm not a desk jockey.

213
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.430
I'm a detective. I'm a good one.

214
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.900
I've been acquitted of all charges.

215
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.905
- Detective. you are no doubt aware

216
00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:31.823
of the publicity surrounding this case.

217
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.700
To be clear. you are not being punished.

218
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.530
We are simply waiting for
public opinion to die down

219
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.740
and in so doing.

220
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.850
protecting the reputation
of this police department.

221
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.580
In doing so.

222
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.380
we also believe that we are
protecting you. detective.

223
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.200
- Since when did supporting
the media's agenda

224
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.490
overpower the rights of
a decorated officer?!

225
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.670
- That's enough. detective.

226
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.840
We're on your side.

227
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.673
You can sit down now.

228
00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:58.263
- No. you're not on my side!

229
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.960
You're covering your own asses!

230
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.703
- Sit down. detective.

231
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.790
- You know about this. suits. huh?

232
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.293
- You need to sit down now.

233
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:24.069
(phone vibrating)
(phone ringing)

234
00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:37.064
(people chattering)
(upbeat music)

235
00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:48.288
(phone vibrating)
(phone ringing)

236
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.297
- Fuck you. phone.

237
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.113
Detective.

238
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.150
- Pearce. where the hell you been. man?

239
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.700
I've been calling you for days.

240
00:15:09.453 --> 00:15:10.960
- Doing some paperwork.

241
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.080
- [Detective Saks] What?

242
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.280
Where are you right now?

243
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.983
- I'm in a meeting with Jack.

244
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.823
What do you want. partner?

245
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.093
- Just wondering if you had a
moment 'cause we need to talk.

246
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.153
- I'm listening.

247
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.663
- [Detective Saks] They
want me to testify.

248
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.130
- Want you to testify what?

249
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.913
- Yeah. testify in your civil suit.

250
00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:42.762
- What are you talking about?

251
00:15:42.762 --> 00:15:43.794
- Your civil suit.

252
00:15:43.794 --> 00:15:44.740
If you answered your damn phone.

253
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.750
you'd know what I was talking about.

254
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.320
Look. this is serious. Pearce.

255
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.585
The Bell family. they're suing you

256
00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:54.113
for damages and loss of life.

257
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.593
Pearce?!
- Yeah.

258
00:15:59.472 --> 00:16:00.830
- [Detective Saks] Can you hear me?

259
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.663
- I'm here.

260
00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:03.699
- Look. the family.

261
00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:06.860
they're making this out to
be a racial profile shooting.

262
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.693
Okay?

263
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.130
The departments asking several
officers from your past

264
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.403
to come in and testify.

265
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.143
- What the fuck is this. Saks?

266
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.413
I'm not a god damn racist!

267
00:16:24.634 --> 00:16:27.701
I didn't do anything wrong.

268
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:28.751
I'm a good detective.

269
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.410
All I've done is--
- Look. I know.

270
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.243
I know that.

271
00:16:32.243 --> 00:16:34.820
You don't have to
convince me of this. okay?

272
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.653
You and I.

273
00:16:35.653 --> 00:16:37.463
we've been doing this a
long time together. brother.

274
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.360
- They're always out for the money. man.

275
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.840
And they want to burn me to the ground.

276
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.673
- Where are you. man?

277
00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:46.506
You at the (mumbles)?

278
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.970
I can come pick you up right now. okay?

279
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:49.883
- I gotta go.

280
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.373
- Shit.

281
00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.309
(glass shattering)
- Hey!

282
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:01.637
Buddy. what are you doing?!

283
00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:02.770
You're cut off. man.

284
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.603
You gotta go.

285
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.353
Hey!

286
00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:15.640
Hey. you can't take that bottle!

287
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.473
Hey. buddy!

288
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.658
Asshole.

289
00:17:20.658 --> 00:17:23.741
(somber piano music)

290
00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.890
(tires squealing)
(horn honking)

291
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.690
- Watch where you're going!
- Fuck!

292
00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:36.687
Open your eyes!

293
00:17:36.687 --> 00:17:39.270
(somber music)

294
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.077
(phone beeping)

295
00:17:57.274 --> 00:17:59.660
- [Dispatcher] Call center.
please state your ID.

296
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.530
- This is Detective Pearce from the 14th.

297
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.913
batch 5-5-2-5.

298
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.240
- [Dispatcher] Go ahead. detective.

299
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.790
- Yeah. I need a follow up
address from a recent case.

300
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.623
- [Dispatcher] I'm sorry. detective.

301
00:18:09.623 --> 00:18:12.223
You know we don't provide
that type of information here.

302
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:37.522
- Damn it.

303
00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:41.639
(phone beeping)

304
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.967
(phone ringing)

305
00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:08.110
- Are you heading to bed?

306
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.943
- Yeah.

307
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.150
- I wish you wouldn't drink that stuff.

308
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.733
- Me neither.

309
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.123
- Nothing's gonna bring
our boy back. Ethan.

310
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.750
And that stuff's just adding
to the pain and distancing us.

311
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.633
- I know. baby.

312
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.620
Baby. I know.

313
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.200
It probably makes things worse.

314
00:20:49.371 --> 00:20:50.760
Which parent thinks

315
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.860
that they're gonna outlive their children?

316
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.020
I have a hard time
thinking of anything else.

317
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:03.900
- You should come tomorrow

318
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.700
to the bereavement meetings with me.

319
00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:12.057
- You know I have a tough
time talking to strangers

320
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.467
and sharing my feelings and all that.

321
00:21:18.564 --> 00:21:20.030
- You didn't have a tough time

322
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.276
talking to me when I was a stranger.

323
00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:24.230
- Yeah. that's 'cause you
was fine as hell though.

324
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.480
(laughing)

325
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.750
- Trey would want you to be happy.

326
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.603
- Yeah.

327
00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:38.693
That boy sure could make me laugh.

328
00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:42.208
(laughing)

329
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.970
- It's gonna take time

330
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.813
and we have to be strong
for Damon and Dom.

331
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.293
Okay?

332
00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.713
- Yeah.

333
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.547
- Plus. that stuff makes
you a little grumpy.

334
00:22:04.547 --> 00:22:06.893
just a little bit grumpy.

335
00:22:06.893 --> 00:22:08.158
- What's wrong with grumpy?

336
00:22:08.158 --> 00:22:10.800
(laughing)

337
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.620
I'm gonna head to bed before
you start calling me sleepy.

338
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.133
or happy. or one of them
little motherfuckers.

339
00:22:21.285 --> 00:22:22.118
- Okay.

340
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.703
I'm just gonna finish tidying up.

341
00:22:24.703 --> 00:22:26.534
I'll be up soon. okay?

342
00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:28.282
- Okay. I love you baby.

343
00:22:28.282 --> 00:22:29.365
- I love you.

344
00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.832
- All right.
- Okay.

345
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:46.793
- It'll be 49.20. buddy.

346
00:22:47.973 --> 00:22:48.973
- All right. thanks.

347
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.003
- Hey. that's 50 bucks. man!

348
00:22:59.031 --> 00:23:01.181
- [Detective Pearce]
Yeah. keep the change.

349
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.190
(Pearce sighing)

350
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.433
(gate clattering)

351
00:23:54.969 --> 00:23:57.886
(knocking on door)

352
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.603
- Ethan!

353
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.183
Who is it?

354
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.093
- Mrs. Bell?

355
00:24:29.142 --> 00:24:30.052
(Imani screaming)

356
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.969
No. no. no. no. no. no!

357
00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:35.055
- Ethan!

358
00:24:36.694 --> 00:24:37.527
Ethan!

359
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:47.231
(thudding)
(Pearce groaning)

360
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.560
- Get somewhere safe.

361
00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:55.457
(Pearce groaning)

362
00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:07.431
- Fuck.

363
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.020
- Call 9-1-1.

364
00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:15.463
- Mr. and Mrs. Bell?

365
00:25:19.114 --> 00:25:22.530
I'm just here to apologize.

366
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.130
Don't call the police please.

367
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.900
Just put the gun down.

368
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.950
- You kill our son and
you come into our home?

369
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.680
To what. tie up loose ends?

370
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.513
- No.

371
00:25:33.452 --> 00:25:34.483
No. god no. no.

372
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.233
- Why the gun?

373
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.420
- I'm a detective.

374
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.340
I carry a gun.

375
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.563
- A detective court ordered
to stay the hell away from us.

376
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.730
- I'm not here to hurt
either of you. okay?

377
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.173
I just want to apolog--

378
00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.423
(thudding)

379
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:02.002
- [Imani] Ethan!

380
00:26:07.162 --> 00:26:07.995
- Freeze!

381
00:26:09.027 --> 00:26:10.570
Don't move!

382
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.280
On your knees. hands on your head!

383
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.200
- [Imani] Ethan.

384
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.990
- On your knees. hands on your head!

385
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.575
- Ethan. stop!
- Don't do it. don't do it!

386
00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:18.470
(thudding)

387
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.303
- [Imani] Ethan. stop!

388
00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:21.073
Just call the police.

389
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.590
- Don't call the cops.

390
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.283
Please.

391
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.770
Okay.

392
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.923
I'm gonna leave and no one
has to know I was here.

393
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.753
Please.

394
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.833
I've lost everything.

395
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.593
- You've lost everything?

396
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.710
You took everything from us.

397
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.543
You stole our son!

398
00:26:49.658 --> 00:26:53.990
And then you enter our home
illegally and for what?

399
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.293
Why are you here?

400
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.443
- I just wanted to apologize.

401
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.123
- Apologize?

402
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.883
Only those who are
guilty need to apologize.

403
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.520
Do you have something you
want to apologize for?

404
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.070
Is there something you want to admit.

405
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:20.690
like killing my baby for
no reason in cold blood

406
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.470
and then you planted a gun on him?

407
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.955
- No.
- Yeah.

408
00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:27.190
- Nuh-uh. nuh-uh.

409
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.170
- I know you did it.

410
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.503
- You have no idea what
it's like out there. okay?

411
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.447
I put my life on the line
every day for people like you.

412
00:27:37.487 --> 00:27:38.680
And what's the thanks I get?

413
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.470
I'm being demoted.

414
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.520
I'm losing my family.

415
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.400
I'm losing the respect
of everyone for what?

416
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.190
It was an accident.

417
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.023
- An accident?

418
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.343
You know that's bullshit!

419
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.560
I lay awake every night for four months.

420
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.007
four months of torture.

421
00:28:01.503 --> 00:28:03.170
tossing and turning.

422
00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:06.286
consumed with emptiness.

423
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:12.833
thinking of all the ways I could kill you.

424
00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:21.325
And here you are now.

425
00:28:26.609 --> 00:28:28.192
- You have the gun.

426
00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:33.112
Now's your chance.

427
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.990
(suspenseful music)

428
00:28:43.925 --> 00:28:46.925
(gunshots blasting)

429
00:28:58.808 --> 00:28:59.641
- Ethan?

430
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:01.623
Ethan?

431
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:12.573
- I will not tarnish my
son's memory with revenge.

432
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.087
You're not worth it.

433
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.840
I thought you said you
came here to apologize.

434
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.690
- [Imani] I don't want
to hear that. Ethan.

435
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.523
- Let him speak.

436
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.253
Speak.

437
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.870
- I did what I was trained to do.

438
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.270
- Why would you shoot?

439
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.840
He was just a kid. you know?

440
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.660
He was a good kid.

441
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.163
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

442
00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:45.000
- He had a gun.
- Bullshit!

443
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.560
- There's no chance my baby had a gun.

444
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.710
- That's a damn lie.

445
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.763
We know our boy.

446
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.333
He was an artist. not a criminal.

447
00:29:54.843 --> 00:29:59.163
There's more to it and
I know you're lying.

448
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.973
- I never meant to hurt anyone. okay?

449
00:30:06.832 --> 00:30:08.632
But now it's like I have the plague.

450
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.770
I go from being a respected public servant

451
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.920
to being the media's
new story of the week.

452
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.853
soon to be forgotten while
my life is left in ruins.

453
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.600
- Can you even hear yourself?

454
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.630
You took the life of another human being.

455
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.613
a child.

456
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.530
And all you can do is stand
here and talk about yourself

457
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.243
and your public image.

458
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.343
You remorseless piece of shit.

459
00:30:39.077 --> 00:30:40.433
- Do you think I feel bad?

460
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.810
What do you want me to say.

461
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.930
that I could have done it differently?

462
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.430
I followed protocol.

463
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.167
I was just doing my job.

464
00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:51.684
- You are not the victim here.

465
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:53.184
You killed my son!

466
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:56.381
You killed my son!

467
00:30:59.623 --> 00:31:00.456
Our son.

468
00:31:04.773 --> 00:31:06.513
You didn't come here to apologize.

469
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.720
so what did you come here for?

470
00:31:14.762 --> 00:31:17.095
- Look. what's done is done.

471
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.260
- What?

472
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.580
- Why are we dragging this out?

473
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.240
Why make the situation worse?

474
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.160
- Worse?

475
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.720
How can it get any worse?

476
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.350
You come into our home harassing us

477
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.250
after ripping out of soul?

478
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.940
- I had enough of your shit.

479
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.940
I'm calling the cops.

480
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.850
We'll let the cops decide.

481
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.940
- Okay. you call the police.

482
00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.540
but you're the one with the gun.

483
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.473
That's my gun.

484
00:31:42.933 --> 00:31:43.766
Hm?

485
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.970
How are you gonna explain that?

486
00:31:48.813 --> 00:31:49.763
Look in the mirror.

487
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.640
Who are they gonna believe?

488
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.790
I didn't do anything.

489
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.340
I didn't hurt anyone.

490
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.683
I just came here to talk
and you attacked me.

491
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.623
- Ethan.

492
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.343
- No.

493
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.693
I refuse to give up my rights.

494
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.180
I'm an American citizen in my own home!

495
00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.203
- You're not gonna kill a cop.

496
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.473
- Maybe.

497
00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:26.614
Maybe not.

498
00:32:28.855 --> 00:32:29.855
but I could.

499
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.880
- Nobody is killin' anybody.

500
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.945
- And I'd have every
god damn right to do so

501
00:32:34.945 --> 00:32:37.725
and it's but a little
bit too late for that.

502
00:32:37.725 --> 00:32:38.558
isn't it?

503
00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:41.720
- But it's not too late now.

504
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.553
Please.

505
00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:46.742
- You're not just a cop.

506
00:32:46.742 --> 00:32:47.575
You're the man that killed our son.

507
00:32:51.139 --> 00:32:54.137
(phone ringing)

508
00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:55.220
- It's Damon.

509
00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.467
- Leave it.

510
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.330
- He will worry if we don't pick up.

511
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.666
- You need to leave our house.

512
00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:03.640
- Yeah. you give me my gun back.

513
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.560
- You ain't getting
your god damn gun back.

514
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.393
- Ethan.

515
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.710
- Give me my gun back and I'll go.

516
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.653
- Hell no.

517
00:33:10.653 --> 00:33:13.620
(phone ringing)

518
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.220
- Hello?

519
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.110
- Mom. I got the offer.

520
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.726
- Oh. that's nice.

521
00:33:18.726 --> 00:33:19.970
- That's nice?

522
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.630
That means I'm moving back.

523
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.463
I got the tenure.

524
00:33:22.463 --> 00:33:24.110
Now I can help you and
pops more with the house.

525
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.880
- That's wonderful. dear.

526
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.133
Can we talk tomorrow?

527
00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:30.270
- Mom. did you hear what I said?

528
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.203
I got the tenure.

529
00:33:32.051 --> 00:33:33.965
I'm moving back home.

530
00:33:33.965 --> 00:33:35.310
(thudding)
(Imani gasping)

531
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.191
What was that?

532
00:33:36.191 --> 00:33:37.370
Mom. are you listening to me?

533
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.220
- I'm watching TV with your father.

534
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.541
I'll give him the news. okay?

535
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:45.760
- Ain't the TV broken
and I've been tenured.

536
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.120
Is everything okay?

537
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.773
- Your dad fixed the TV.

538
00:33:50.404 --> 00:33:52.660
- Dad hasn't fixed anything in his life.

539
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.550
- He called someone to fix the TV.

540
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.360
I'm gonna call you tomorrow. okay?

541
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.895
I love you. son.

542
00:33:58.895 --> 00:34:01.878
(phone beeping)

543
00:34:01.878 --> 00:34:02.961
- You stupid.

544
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.110
Who's Damon?

545
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.943
- He's our son.

546
00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:07.110
- What did you tell him?

547
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.090
- Nothing.

548
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.130
He calls every night.

549
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.987
- This is wrong.

550
00:34:11.987 --> 00:34:13.154
This is wrong!

551
00:34:16.553 --> 00:34:21.553
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

552
00:34:24.761 --> 00:34:29.761
(phone vibrating)
(faint moaning)

553
00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:39.974
(Sienna laughing)

554
00:34:49.563 --> 00:34:54.563
(phone vibrating)
(faint moaning)

555
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.910
- Dom?

556
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.149
- [Sienna] Dom's kinda busy.

557
00:34:58.149 --> 00:34:59.223
- Hey. Sienna.

558
00:34:59.223 --> 00:35:00.920
Can you grab a brother for a second?

559
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.753
- Oh. sure.

560
00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:02.901
Where do you want me to grab him?

561
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:03.863
(Sienna laughing)

562
00:35:03.863 --> 00:35:05.850
- Ha-ha-ha. you got jokes.

563
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.350
Seriously though. can you put
him on the phone for a sec?

564
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.313
- Yeah. yeah. you're no fun.

565
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.060
- Yeah. what up. bro?

566
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.510
- Yo man. listen.

567
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.803
I need you to head over to
mom and dad's crib real quick.

568
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.650
- Why?

569
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.134
It's like 10 o'clock. man.

570
00:35:24.134 --> 00:35:25.240
Ain't they asleep by now?

571
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.293
- No.

572
00:35:26.293 --> 00:35:28.790
I just spoke to mom and I gave
her some really exciting news

573
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.020
and she acted all weird and shit.

574
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.493
I don't know.

575
00:35:31.493 --> 00:35:32.887
- Dam. come on. man.

576
00:35:32.887 --> 00:35:35.490
You're trippin' for nothing right now.

577
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.590
And besides. I'm kicking
with Sienna tonight.

578
00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.833
You know what's up.

579
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.520
- Man. just shut up and head
over to the crib please.

580
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.365
Take 10 minutes out of your night. okay?

581
00:35:45.365 --> 00:35:46.373
And just. I don't know.

582
00:35:46.373 --> 00:35:47.206
just check on 'em

583
00:35:47.206 --> 00:35:48.631
and then you can get
back to whatever it is

584
00:35:48.631 --> 00:35:50.070
you and Sienna were doing.

585
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.857
Besides. you can drop off
that 50 spot you owe me.

586
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.310
- Whatever. cock block.

587
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.680
You can get your damn loot when
I see your ass at Christmas.

588
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.460
Matter of fact. forget that.

589
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.530
I'm gonna keep that 50 for gas now.

590
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.610
Later. bitch.

591
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.932
- Yo. yo. yo. yo. yo.
- What?

592
00:36:05.932 --> 00:36:07.430
- Make sure you holla
at me when you get there

593
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.917
so I know everything's 100. all right?

594
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:11.667
- All right. you bet.

595
00:36:12.532 --> 00:36:13.858
- Peace.

596
00:36:13.858 --> 00:36:17.112
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

597
00:36:17.112 --> 00:36:18.112
- Hey. babe.

598
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.410
I gotta roll out for a few minutes.

599
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.070
- What. why?

600
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.240
- I'll be a few minutes.

601
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.300
It's Dam.

602
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.890
He's worried about my mom again.

603
00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:27.730
- He's always worried.

604
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.150
Ever since he moved cross
country. he's been worried.

605
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.307
- I know.

606
00:36:31.307 --> 00:36:34.600
But ever since Trey's. well.

607
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.410
ain't nobody been the same.

608
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.030
I'll be like a half hour at the most.

609
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.891
- Okay. well if you're
leaving. I'm coming.

610
00:36:39.891 --> 00:36:41.970
- (laughing) No.

611
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:46.160
because you. my dear. have been drinking.

612
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.270
and you know my mom don't
play with that booze stuff.

613
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.473
- Oh god. I know.

614
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.730
Okay. I'll wait in the car.

615
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.563
We need more wine.

616
00:36:54.563 --> 00:36:56.440
We can grab some on the way back.

617
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.600
- All right. that works.

618
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.564
Hurry up and go get ready then.

619
00:37:00.564 --> 00:37:01.564
The movie's waiting.

620
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.203
- You mean the chill part.

621
00:37:07.301 --> 00:37:09.120
(Dom laughing)

622
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.953
- That too.

623
00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:18.469
(rap music)
(Sienna laughing)

624
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.130
- Okay. it is not just for hook ups.

625
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.650
I've been to two swipe right weddings.

626
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.130
- Whoa.

627
00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.150
Well. I've been to like
three Black Planet weddings.

628
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.983
Beat that.

629
00:37:27.983 --> 00:37:30.353
(Sienna laughing)

630
00:37:30.353 --> 00:37:32.840
- You know. speaking of weddings.

631
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.960
my parents are so happy
your parents are coming down

632
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.320
for their 20th anniversary
party next weekend.

633
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.111
I'm just glad my dad really likes you.

634
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:41.944
(Sienna laughing)

635
00:37:41.944 --> 00:37:43.277
- For real. huh?

636
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.393
- Yeah.

637
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.557
- Works for me.

638
00:37:51.427 --> 00:37:52.713
- Oh. I love this jam.

639
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.829
My sister and I used
to make dance routines

640
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:57.007
and perform them for our parents

641
00:37:57.007 --> 00:37:58.713
and this was one of them.

642
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.540
- My brothers and I used
to do that same thing.

643
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.570
Yeah. Dam was always the lead singer

644
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:08.567
and he'd make Trey and I
be his back up dancers.

645
00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:10.640

- Yeah. yeah. I got some moves.

653
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.546
All in due time.

654
00:38:33.546 --> 00:38:35.251
(Sienna laughing)

655
00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:37.807
- Well. you should show me some
of those moves by (mumbles).

656
00:38:39.399 --> 00:38:40.249
- Be careful now.

657
00:38:44.562 --> 00:38:45.936

- Look would you made me do.

661
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.340
I just wanted to talk. not this.

662
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.173
- Talk?

663
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.903
You came here on your
own guilt. nothing more.

664
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.090
so just say what you
have to say and leave.

665
00:39:18.582 --> 00:39:20.282
- It's not that simple now. is it?

666
00:39:22.006 --> 00:39:23.970
You two have turned this into something

667
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.110
it didn't need to be!

668
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.680
- Us two?

669
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.820
You came into our house
and you attacked my wife!

670
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.440
- I didn't attack anybody.

671
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.103
I wanted to stop her from
screaming so I could explain.

672
00:39:35.103 --> 00:39:36.397
- Explain what?!

673
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:40.050
How you set up our son and
killed him in cold blood?

674
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.280
Is that what you came here
to explain. detective?!

675
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.380
- I didn't set him up.

676
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.640
He had a gun.

677
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.790
- My son would have
never had a gun on him.

678
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.650
He was not that type of person.

679
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.330
- Well. maybe you didn't know your kid

680
00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.437
as well as you think you did.

681
00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:00.383
You people are all the same.
- Oh. there it is.

682
00:40:00.383 --> 00:40:01.216
What was that?

683
00:40:01.216 --> 00:40:02.540
You people?

684
00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.503
- I was just doing my job.

685
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.750
Okay?

686
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.160
And now I can't leave my house

687
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.330
without being called a racist.

688
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.830
I'm chained to my desk at work.

689
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.523
My wife barely talks to me.

690
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.320
But I guess that's what happens

691
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.210
when a white man shoots a black criminal.

692
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.142
He's called a racist.

693
00:40:22.142 --> 00:40:24.970
- Get out!

694
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:25.803
Get out.

695
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.223
Just leave our home please.

696
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.253
Just leave.

697
00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:38.983
We won't say a word. like you said.

698
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.860
What's done is done

699
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.970
and you're free to go

700
00:40:46.176 --> 00:40:49.383
with no worry or repercussion.

701
00:40:52.093 --> 00:40:55.010
Please just leave our family alone.

702
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.780
- If either of you say a
word of this to anyone.

703
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.820
what's left of my life is over

704
00:41:22.617 --> 00:41:24.540
and I will have nothing to lose.

705
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.020
Do you understand that?

706
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.813
- We have nothing to gain
by calling the police.

707
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.423
We just want to be left alone.

708
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.103
You have our word.

709
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.373
- We understand.

710
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.623
Please just leave.

711
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.950
(suspenseful music)

712
00:41:58.564 --> 00:42:01.260
(knocking on door)
- Mom. mom?

713
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.530
- Who the hell is that?

714
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.363
Who the hell is that?!

715
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.510
- Hey. ma. pops?
- No. no.

716
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.410
- Dam be trippin'. told me to come by.

717
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.813
What's going on?

718
00:42:17.813 --> 00:42:19.300
What the hell's he doing here?

719
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.160
- Everything's okay.

720
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.740
He's just leaving.

721
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.660
He only came by to talk. okay?

722
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.080
Everything is okay.

723
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.840
- Everything don't look
all right to me. ma.

724
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.907
- It's fine. son.

725
00:42:28.907 --> 00:42:30.570
It's fine.

726
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.350
Just let the detective leave.

727
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.430
- Yeah. it's--

728
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.800
- He ain't supposed to be here.

729
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.983
There's a broken table.

730
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.053
And pops. you got blood on your mouth.

731
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.423
- Put the phone down. Dom.

732
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.740
There's no need to call anyone.

733
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.363
He's just leaving. okay?

734
00:43:03.889 --> 00:43:04.739
- The question is

735
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.003
how come none of y'all
ain't call the police yet?

736
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.180
- There's no need to call anyone

737
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.613
'cause I was just here
to set things right.

738
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.203
- Set things right?

739
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.743
You don't get to set things right.

740
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.550
You ain't even supposed
to be near my parents.

741
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.867
and that's court orders!

742
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.473
- You're right.

743
00:43:39.494 --> 00:43:41.143
That's why I'm gonna go.

744
00:43:41.143 --> 00:43:43.890
I didn't want to cause any trouble--

745
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.690
- Damn right. you shouldn't be here!

746
00:43:48.152 --> 00:43:50.647
And yeah. you need to leave in handcuffs.

747
00:43:51.683 --> 00:43:54.110
- Dom. we're fine. honey.

748
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.960
- Just listen to your parents. son. okay?

749
00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.300
There's no need to call anyone.

750
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.133
Just drop the phone.

751
00:43:58.133 --> 00:43:58.966
- Don't!

752
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.270
Don't touch me. man.

753
00:44:04.158 --> 00:44:07.713
And I for damn sure ain't your son.

754
00:44:09.541 --> 00:44:10.624
You got that?

755
00:44:15.927 --> 00:44:17.809
- Put the phone down.

756
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:19.568
- Detective. please.
- Hang up the phone. son.

757
00:44:19.568 --> 00:44:21.227
- [Imani] Please. please. please.

758
00:44:21.227 --> 00:44:22.394
- Put it down.

759
00:44:25.869 --> 00:44:27.020
(Imani crying)
- Detective?

760
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.617
- 9-1-1. what is your emer--
- Put it down.

761
00:44:28.617 --> 00:44:31.284
(phone beeping)

762
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:38.785
(phone vibrating)

763
00:44:38.785 --> 00:44:39.618
Okay.

764
00:44:41.037 --> 00:44:42.660
You cancel that call.

765
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.763
Cancel it and tell them it was a mistake.

766
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.303
Tell them it was a mistake.

767
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.723
Do it now.

768
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.270
- Dom.

769
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.523
- And play it nice.

770
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.740
- [Dispatcher] 9-1-1.
what is your emergency?

771
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.800
- Hello.

772
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.213
Yeah. sorry about the confusion.

773
00:45:06.197 --> 00:45:07.597
A kid got hold of the phone.

774
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.640
It won't happen again.

775
00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.473
- [Dispatcher] Okay. sir.

776
00:45:11.473 --> 00:45:12.306
Thank you.

777
00:45:12.306 --> 00:45:15.797
Please be more careful next--
(phone beeping)

778
00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.830
- Get over with your parents.

779
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.573
Move.

780
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:39.450
(thudding)
- What are you doing?!

781
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:40.283
- Easy. kid.

782
00:45:40.283 --> 00:45:41.116
I'm still a cop.

783
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:43.733
- Just let the detective go.

784
00:45:46.805 --> 00:45:48.173
- Oh no.

785
00:45:48.173 --> 00:45:50.137
Did you really think it was
gonna help the situation

786
00:45:50.137 --> 00:45:52.300
having your son stop by. huh?

787
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300
- I didn't ask anyone to stop by.

788
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.900
You created this situation.

789
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.183
You can end it by leaving.

790
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.480
- Doesn't seem that easy anymore

791
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.850
with your little hero
busting through the door.

792
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.240
- No one wants any more problems.

793
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.290
We already said we wouldn't say anything.

794
00:46:11.094 --> 00:46:12.344
- What do you mean. pops?

795
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.645
You a murderer and a racist. man!

796
00:46:16.645 --> 00:46:17.478
- Dom.

797
00:46:17.478 --> 00:46:19.050
- Oh yeah. that's real easy to say

798
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.720
when the situation is reversed. isn't it?

799
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.900
I mean. who's really the victim here?

800
00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.300
All anyone hears is white cop.

801
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.750
I didn't have a choice

802
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.710
and I was guilty before I even
pulled the friggin' trigger!

803
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.223
- Don't play that victim
shit with me. man.

804
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.123
I mean. why are you even
here in the first place?

805
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:39.963
Can't sleep?

806
00:46:41.488 --> 00:46:42.892
I get it.

807
00:46:42.892 --> 00:46:46.940
Flashes of murder revolving around

808
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.950
that tiny little head of yours. huh?

809
00:46:50.192 --> 00:46:53.060
Yeah. it's real haunting. I'm sure.

810
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.180
- Dom. enough.

811
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.913
The situation's already
way out of control.

812
00:46:59.203 --> 00:47:02.036
(phone vibrating)

813
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:34.920
- Hello?

814
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.753
- Where are you?

815
00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:37.671
You were supposed to be here hours ago.

816
00:47:37.671 --> 00:47:38.504
Once a week.

817
00:47:38.504 --> 00:47:39.740
You get your daughter once a week

818
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.920
and you manage to screw that up?

819
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.113
- Just stop. stop.

820
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.483
Sorry. okay?

821
00:47:46.771 --> 00:47:47.753
Something came up.

822
00:47:47.753 --> 00:47:48.720
It's important.

823
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.260
- What's more important
than your daughter?

824
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.093
She's six.

825
00:47:51.093 --> 00:47:51.960
She needs her father.

826
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.760
You know. you can mess up your own life

827
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.380
but I will not let you mess up hers.

828
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.213
- Sorry.

829
00:48:07.086 --> 00:48:08.900
I messed up.

830
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.697
- I know. but you can make
up for it if you just--

831
00:48:11.697 --> 00:48:12.677
- No. no. no.

832
00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:15.433
I'm messed up.

833
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.250
- What did you do?

834
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.033
Where are you?

835
00:48:24.432 --> 00:48:27.183
- Just trying to figure this thing out.

836
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.930
- Well. you better figure it out soon

837
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.400
'cause we might lose our house

838
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.861
and then when are we
supposed to go then. Tom?

839
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:36.694
- No. no.

840
00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:39.480
- You know?

841
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.683
- Saks told me.

842
00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:44.393
Look. I just need some more time.

843
00:48:45.238 --> 00:48:46.238
I'm talking to them.

844
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.461
Everything's gonna be okay.

845
00:48:49.461 --> 00:48:51.128
- [Jessica] Jason...

846
00:48:53.165 --> 00:48:55.070
- I didn't do anything wrong. did I?

847
00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.150
- [Jessica] I can't go back in time.

848
00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.913
- I know. but how do I fix things?

849
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.893
- Fix us?

850
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:06.313
- No. just fix everything?

851
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.293
- Just stop.

852
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.653
Stop drinking. stop running away.

853
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.150
and then maybe one day. we can heal

854
00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.860
and forgive each other for what we said.

855
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.870
if not for us. for Callie's sake.

856
00:49:29.397 --> 00:49:31.064
- So you forgive me?

857
00:49:32.014 --> 00:49:33.264
- I don't know.

858
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:37.880
- I don't know if they'll forgive me.

859
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.043
Not now.

860
00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.260
They're afraid.

861
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:45.210
- Who?

862
00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:46.043
- [Callie] Mama?

863
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.170
- I'm in here. baby.

864
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.010
We woke up Callie.

865
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.903
I'm just on the phone with papa.

866
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.831
I'm gonna come tuck you back in.

867
00:49:55.831 --> 00:49:58.530
- But I want to talk to papa.

868
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.193
- [Jessica] She wants to talk to you.

869
00:50:00.193 --> 00:50:01.026
- No.

870
00:50:01.026 --> 00:50:01.859
No. Jess.

871
00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:02.692
I can't talk right now. please.

872
00:50:02.692 --> 00:50:03.525
- [Jessica] She was waiting
for you to tuck her in.

873
00:50:03.525 --> 00:50:04.484
- Jess. please.

874
00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:09.484
- [Callie] Hi. papa.

875
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:11.763
- Hey. princess.

876
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.573
- Are you at work?

877
00:50:16.567 --> 00:50:18.051
- Yeah.

878
00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:19.705
It's work.

879
00:50:19.705 --> 00:50:24.307
- [Callie] You said you'd be
(mumbles) with me tonight.

880
00:50:24.307 --> 00:50:25.913
- I'm so sorry. baby.

881
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.223
- When are you coming here?

882
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.920
- You just need to go back
to bed. princess. okay?

883
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.265
I'll see you soon.

884
00:50:36.265 --> 00:50:38.552
- [Callie] Are you coming now?

885
00:50:38.552 --> 00:50:41.660
- No. not now.

886
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.610
- I got a new Stella book.

887
00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:47.107
- Oh yeah?

888
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:51.173
- Okay. say bye to papa.
- Good night. papa.

889
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.308
- Good night. Callie.

890
00:50:55.308 --> 00:50:56.855
I love you.

891
00:50:56.855 --> 00:50:58.103
- Love you. papa.

892
00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:02.890
- [Jessica] Jason.

893
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.173
let's talk tomorrow.

894
00:51:06.544 --> 00:51:07.823
- I love her so much.

895
00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:10.647
- I know you do.

896
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.180
- If anything happened to her.

897
00:51:16.265 --> 00:51:20.094
I don't know if I could forgive myself.

898
00:51:20.094 --> 00:51:22.373
- Nothing's gonna happen to her.

899
00:51:22.373 --> 00:51:24.723
You just need to go to
bed now and sleep it off.

900
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.243
- Yeah.

901
00:51:29.978 --> 00:51:32.061
- No. no. please. please.

902
00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:36.056
- I should go.

903
00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:41.809
(phone beeping)

904
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.153
- Okay. time for bed.

905
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.653
- Mommy. are you okay?

906
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.343
- Of course. I'm okay.

907
00:51:51.343 --> 00:51:52.600
Why would you ask that?

908
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.920
- Because you won't let papa come home.

909
00:51:56.592 --> 00:51:58.740
- Papa just needs his own time right now.

910
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.140
- Did papa do something wrong?

911
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.333
Is that why you're mad at him?

912
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.550
- I'm not mad at papa.

913
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:08.830
He's mad at himself.

914
00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.933
- How can you be mad at yourself?

915
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.663
- I hope you never have to find out.

916
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:15.403
Okay?

917
00:52:15.403 --> 00:52:17.030
Now. time for bed.

918
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.663
You just climb right in here.

919
00:52:23.072 --> 00:52:24.572
- You're a father?

920
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.460
How old is your daughter?

921
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:32.863
- She's six.

922
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.503
She means everything to me.

923
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.590
- I know how you feel.

924
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.740
So did my son.

925
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.883
- Enough of this sentimental bullshit!

926
00:52:46.924 --> 00:52:49.040
You're just a coward and a racist. man.

927
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:49.890
- Come on.

928
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:51.460
- This has nothing to do with race.

929
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.360
- This has everything to do with race!

930
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.020
- I'm not a racist.

931
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.280
My whole career has been based

932
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.050
on cleaning up your neighborhood.

933
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:00.883
protecting your kids.

934
00:53:00.883 --> 00:53:02.700
basically protecting you from yourselves.

935
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.020
- Oh yeah?

936
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.570
Like how you protected my bruv?

937
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.895
- Your brother was a criminal.

938
00:53:07.895 --> 00:53:09.200
- Oh yeah.

939
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.560
But all black men are criminals to you.

940
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.393
Ain't that right?

941
00:53:11.393 --> 00:53:13.440
- I've been surrounded by
black people my whole life.

942
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.341
- You murder them too?

943
00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:15.653
- Dom.
- Enough.

944
00:53:15.653 --> 00:53:16.903
- Baby. please.

945
00:53:18.806 --> 00:53:19.890
- No.

946
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.840
There's a reason why my brother's dead.

947
00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:27.130
It's because a white cop saw a black kid

948
00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:28.603
and had the typical reaction.

949
00:53:29.535 --> 00:53:31.687
Aw yeah. look at that black kid.

950
00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:33.133
He must be trouble.

951
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.560
- You weren't there.

952
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.230
- I didn't need to be!

953
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.353
'Cause it's always the same goddamn thing.

954
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.420
The white kid gets away with a warning.

955
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.766
- You gonna shoot this fucker?

956
00:53:45.766 --> 00:53:47.120
- Now!

957
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.897
- While the black kid.

958
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.810
(suspenseful music)

959
00:53:56.548 --> 00:53:58.207
(gunshot blasting)

960
00:53:58.207 --> 00:54:00.150
He don't even get the warning shot.

961
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.800
- Dom.
- Please stop.

962
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.793
- No!
- Dom!

963
00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:05.193
- I'm sorry. ma.

964
00:54:06.755 --> 00:54:08.811
but I'm sick of this.

965
00:54:08.811 --> 00:54:11.970
See. good young black men like Trey

966
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:17.238
have a hard enough time trying
to survive in they own hood.

967
00:54:17.238 --> 00:54:22.020
let alone getting
slaughtered in the streets

968
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:27.020
because some white man just afraid.

969
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:34.760
- We know this. son.

970
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.560
Your father and I have lived
with this our entire lives.

971
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.893
- Well then. mama--
- You're right. son.

972
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.850
but this isn't helping.

973
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.083
It's not.

974
00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:53.199
- What are you hoping
to gain from being here?

975
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.573
Your only option is to leave.

976
00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.653
- Impossible.

977
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.838
You're stealing my life.

978
00:55:02.838 --> 00:55:04.150
- Stealing your life?

979
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.757
- I just want to forget all this.

980
00:55:07.757 --> 00:55:09.503
but you can't drop it!

981
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.070
- Is this what this is about?

982
00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:17.060
The lawsuit?

983
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.933
Money?

984
00:55:19.782 --> 00:55:20.982
- This is about my life.

985
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.260
my family's life. my reputation.

986
00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.583
- You've already made that quite clear.

987
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:29.280
This is why you shouldn't be here

988
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.020
and why you should leave.

989
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:32.853
- Just leave.

990
00:55:34.196 --> 00:55:36.243
- Can you really put a price on a life?

991
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.500
What happened happened.

992
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.620
It was an accident.

993
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.970
No one was at fault.

994
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.023
but I'm paying for it because I'm white.

995
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.693
- It was an accident?

996
00:55:48.046 --> 00:55:48.879
Hold up.

997
00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:51.513
I thought you said he had a gun.

998
00:55:53.706 --> 00:55:55.130
You fucking liar!

999
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.430
- Don't!
- Come on!

1000
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.790
- Don't be stupid. kid.

1001
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:02.820
- Stop. Dominic. I can't lose you too.

1002
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.773
Please. please.

1003
00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.203
- I didn't come here to kill anybody.

1004
00:56:09.308 --> 00:56:14.308
(horn honking)
(suspenseful music)

1005
00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:32.506
Who is out there?

1006
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:34.564
- I don't know.

1007
00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:37.630
- Don't lie to me. kid.

1008
00:56:39.096 --> 00:56:40.929
- It could be anybody.

1009
00:56:43.247 --> 00:56:46.510
- In the car parked right
in front of the house.

1010
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:47.343
Who is it?

1011
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:52.376
- Look. man.

1012
00:56:52.376 --> 00:56:54.276
She ain't got nothing to do with this.

1013
00:56:55.215 --> 00:56:56.048
- You should have thought of that

1014
00:56:56.048 --> 00:56:57.297
before you brought her here.

1015
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.530
- She ain't gonna be any trouble.

1016
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.040
- You need to make her leave now.

1017
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.610
- She's waiting on me.

1018
00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:08.910
What do you want me to do?

1019
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.143
- You need to make her leave now.

1020
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.033
Walk!

1021
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.318
- What's taking so long?

1022
00:57:57.318 --> 00:57:58.151
If you were gonna have a visit.

1023
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:59.772
maybe you could have invited me in.

1024
00:57:59.772 --> 00:58:00.605
- I'm sorry. babe.

1025
00:58:00.605 --> 00:58:02.490
My parents ain't really
feeling too well tonight.

1026
00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:03.340
- Is everything okay?

1027
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.390
- Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1028
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:05.340
Everything's fine.

1029
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.940
I'm gonna just hang
around for a little while

1030
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.800
and make sure they get to bed okay.

1031
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.010
Tell you what.

1032
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.270
Take the car. right?

1033
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.240
Go pick up some of that wine you like.

1034
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.660
head back to the spot.

1035
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.180
I'mma hook up with you later.

1036
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.580
They're not really up
for a full visit tonight.

1037
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.464
That's all.

1038
00:58:18.464 --> 00:58:19.381
- Oh. okay.

1039
00:58:21.237 --> 00:58:23.345
Are you sure everything's all right?

1040
00:58:23.345 --> 00:58:24.821
- No!
(intense music)

1041
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:26.527
- Get outta here!

1042
00:58:26.527 --> 00:58:27.977
(Imani crying)

1043
00:58:27.977 --> 00:58:29.276
(thudding)
(men groaning)

1044
00:58:29.276 --> 00:58:30.609
- [Imani] Ethan!

1045
00:58:34.916 --> 00:58:35.749
- Pops!

1046
00:58:37.008 --> 00:58:37.841
Get off!

1047
00:58:46.146 --> 00:58:47.775
Get off!

1048
00:58:47.775 --> 00:58:51.041
(Sienna moaning)

1049
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:53.826
(intense music)

1050
00:58:53.826 --> 00:58:58.826
(gunshot blasting)
(Sienna moaning)

1051
00:58:58.974 --> 00:59:00.154
- [Imani] No!

1052
00:59:00.154 --> 00:59:02.819
- No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1053
00:59:02.819 --> 00:59:03.652
Baby!

1054
00:59:05.448 --> 00:59:08.767
(Sienna moaning)
(Dom shushing)

1055
00:59:08.767 --> 00:59:11.434
It's okay. it's okay.
- Oh. baby.

1056
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.020
- Don't!

1057
00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:15.853
Sit down!

1058
00:59:17.463 --> 00:59:20.225
(Sienna moaning)
(Dom moaning)

1059
00:59:20.225 --> 00:59:22.680
Sit down. sit down!

1060
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.540
- Slow your breath.
- It's okay. it's okay.

1061
00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:27.429
- Fuck!

1062
00:59:28.677 --> 00:59:29.510
Fuck.

1063
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.513
Fuck.

1064
00:59:37.511 --> 00:59:38.344
Fuck!

1065
00:59:39.693 --> 00:59:42.360
(siren blaring)

1066
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.570
- Don't I know you?

1067
00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:47.403
- I'm sure. John.

1068
00:59:47.403 --> 00:59:48.236
Don't you remember?

1069
00:59:48.236 --> 00:59:50.050
We woke up beside each
other just the other day.

1070
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:51.410
- Oh yeah.

1071
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.627
Yeah. I know you.

1072
00:59:55.067 --> 00:59:56.540
- You don't know anybody.

1073
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.889
What a jerk.

1074
00:59:57.889 --> 00:59:59.142
(phone ringing)

1075
00:59:59.142 --> 01:00:00.292
I just gotta take this.

1076
01:00:01.569 --> 01:00:04.236
(phone ringing)

1077
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.000
Hey. Jessica.

1078
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.230
Everything okay?

1079
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.250
- Yeah. I think so.

1080
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.150
I just got off the phone with--

1081
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.983
- [John] I didn't do anything.

1082
01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:14.923
- [Jessica] And what have
you gotten yourself into?

1083
01:00:14.923 --> 01:00:16.560
- [John] You got the wrong guy.

1084
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.410
- You want to shut up?

1085
01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.020
This is a phone.

1086
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:19.853
I'm on it.

1087
01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:21.693
You're in there. I'm out here.

1088
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.903
Hey. Jess. sorry about that.

1089
01:00:25.903 --> 01:00:27.980
Everything okay?

1090
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.530
- I'm just worried about Jason.

1091
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.150
- Yeah. hey. you know what?

1092
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:36.553
We all are. okay?

1093
01:00:37.553 --> 01:00:38.386
But don't worry.

1094
01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:39.963
He'll push through this.

1095
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.483
All kinds of officers deal
with these same demons

1096
01:00:42.483 --> 01:00:44.686
whenever they're in a shooting.

1097
01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:45.687
- I know.

1098
01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:46.537
I'm just worried.

1099
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.780
Maybe you can check up on him tonight.

1100
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.030
He's been drinking again.

1101
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.340
- Yeah. I will.

1102
01:00:56.689 --> 01:00:57.522
I will.

1103
01:00:57.522 --> 01:00:58.808
I gotta run.

1104
01:00:58.808 --> 01:00:59.641
- Okay.

1105
01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:11.632
(Sienna moaning)
- Okay.

1106
01:01:11.632 --> 01:01:14.645
Just try to slow your
breath. slow your breath.

1107
01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:17.291
(shushing) Just slow your breathing. okay?

1108
01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:19.160
Just try to relax.

1109
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.387
Try to relax.

1110
01:01:20.387 --> 01:01:22.671
I'm sorry. baby. I'm sorry.

1111
01:01:22.671 --> 01:01:23.504
I'm sorry.

1112
01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:26.701
She needs help.
- I know. I know.

1113
01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.577
- [Jason] Drop the phone.

1114
01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:33.810
- She needs an ambulance. man.

1115
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:34.820
- No ambulance!

1116
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.010
Put the phone down!

1117
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.787
- You could bleed out and
die and nobody gonna care.

1118
01:01:38.787 --> 01:01:40.763
but my girl ain't dyin' tonight!

1119
01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:44.510
(thudding)
(Dom grunting)

1120
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.243
- No phones. no cops. not now!

1121
01:01:48.235 --> 01:01:50.338
(thudding)

1122
01:01:50.338 --> 01:01:51.800
(Sienna moaning)

1123
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.058
Fuck!

1124
01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:54.358
I have to figure this out.

1125
01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.545
Fuck.

1126
01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:02.255
(Sienna moaning)
- Look at me. look at me.

1127
01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:03.429
look at me. look at me.

1128
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:04.920
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1129
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.120
Take a seat. pops.

1130
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.953
- No.

1131
01:02:06.953 --> 01:02:08.350
She needs medical attention

1132
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.020
and you're not letting
us call an ambulance.

1133
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.470
So I'm grabbing a first aid kit

1134
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.590
and it's in that room back there.

1135
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.240
- No one leaves my sight.

1136
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.846
- Well then you can come with
me where I'm about to go.

1137
01:02:17.846 --> 01:02:19.491
- Take a seat!

1138
01:02:19.491 --> 01:02:20.351
- Where are they gonna go?

1139
01:02:20.351 --> 01:02:21.268
- Sit down!

1140
01:02:22.227 --> 01:02:23.227
Take a seat!

1141
01:02:24.701 --> 01:02:25.534
Sit down!

1142
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:28.810
- She needs help!

1143
01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:33.074
- You. hey. you.

1144
01:02:33.074 --> 01:02:34.724
(snapping fingers)
come with me.

1145
01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.053
(Jason shushing)

1146
01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:42.800
Nobody fucking moves.

1147
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.633
Nobody talks.

1148
01:02:43.633 --> 01:02:45.092
You understand?

1149
01:02:45.092 --> 01:02:45.925
- [Ethan] We understand.

1150
01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:46.758
Just hurry up.

1151
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:55.155
- Pops. you need to go get help.

1152
01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:56.250
- I'm not leaving you guys alone with him.

1153
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.866
- No. I can take care of him.

1154
01:02:58.866 --> 01:02:59.699
If he was gonna do something.

1155
01:02:59.699 --> 01:03:01.960
he would have done it already.

1156
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.110
- You guys are my life.

1157
01:03:04.117 --> 01:03:07.313
There's no way I'm leaving
you alone with him.

1158
01:03:07.313 --> 01:03:09.480
- Detective. Sienna is bleeding out.

1159
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.130
We've got to call an ambulance.

1160
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.570
There's nothing but loss
on the other side of this.

1161
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:14.403
- No. it's too late for that.

1162
01:03:14.403 --> 01:03:16.150
- It's not too late.

1163
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.120
Think of your daughter.

1164
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.083
- That's all I think about.

1165
01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.797
Why do you think I came
here in the first place?

1166
01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:22.263
- Then let it end in a better way.

1167
01:03:24.892 --> 01:03:26.350
- Just hurry up and get what you need.

1168
01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:27.183
- [Imani] Look.

1169
01:03:27.183 --> 01:03:28.710
- [Jason] Before they do something stupid.

1170
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:30.480
- Your daughter needs you.

1171
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.830
She needs a father.

1172
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:34.083
You can't read her bedtime
stories from prison.

1173
01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:35.205
- Enough!

1174
01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:37.941
Let's just grab the
(mumbles) and let's go.

1175
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:39.274
- He's a coward.

1176
01:03:48.723 --> 01:03:49.572
- Here.

1177
01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:51.739
(mumbles)

1178
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.473
- If she dies.

1179
01:03:56.473 --> 01:03:58.330
you're gonna lose a lot
more than a civil suit.

1180
01:03:59.866 --> 01:04:02.283
- You scandalous piece of shit.

1181
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.447
You're telling me my brother's dead

1182
01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:08.337
and now she's shot 'cause
you're worried about money?!

1183
01:04:09.337 --> 01:04:10.180
- What. you think it's easy

1184
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.380
being a white cop in this neighborhood?

1185
01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.630
She got shot because you. okay?

1186
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:16.040
You came at me.

1187
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040
You couldn't just leave it alone.

1188
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.960
You couldn't leave her alone.

1189
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.610
And every time you people get pulled over

1190
01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.120
or you're handed a ticket for jay walking.

1191
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.660
you pull the race card.

1192
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.640
Only a mindset like that
would try to make money

1193
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.490
off their own son's accidental death.

1194
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:30.713
- You're disgusting.

1195
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:37.210
How else are us lower class
supposed to get justice?

1196
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.950
With a system that's so corrupt

1197
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:44.426
that you cops get away with murder?

1198
01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:45.840
- You see. there you go again. pops.

1199
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.590
You're pulling the race card. okay?

1200
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.733
I'm not a racist.

1201
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.997
I just call it the way I see it

1202
01:04:51.997 --> 01:04:55.773
and I see a lot day in and day out.

1203
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.450
Hearing excuses coming
from every direction.

1204
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.200
blaming the system for all your problems

1205
01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.060
as I walk down the street

1206
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.480
waiting to get shot in the back.

1207
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.910
waiting for one of your little knives

1208
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:08.911
to stick me with a needle

1209
01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:11.253
while I protect you from yourselves.

1210
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.483
It's got nothing to do with color.

1211
01:05:15.596 --> 01:05:19.598
A spade is a spade.

1212
01:05:19.598 --> 01:05:21.983
- Hm. is that so?

1213
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.340
- You are a racist. man.

1214
01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.240
You can't even call it for what it is.

1215
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.863
Ignorant ass bitch.

1216
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.700
- You don't even realize everyone
on the outside looking in.

1217
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:42.250
All we see is how you
spew hate with your music.

1218
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.580
hating one another. disrespecting women.

1219
01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.120
glorifying murder and crime.

1220
01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.000
Yeah?

1221
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.860
You've been dealt a shitty
hand. but slavery is over.

1222
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.640
It's time to move on!

1223
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.980
You know. you want change?

1224
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.673
Change starts with all of you.

1225
01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.990
So don't blame me for an
environment you choose to support.

1226
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.193
You explain that.

1227
01:06:05.354 --> 01:06:08.830
You'd like nothing more
than for me to be a racist

1228
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.900
so you can justify your
white cop hating agenda.

1229
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:12.733
- [Ethan] Dom.

1230
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.400
He's not worth it.

1231
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.413
Focus on Sienna.

1232
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:24.290
- For the record. I don't
hate all white cops.

1233
01:06:24.816 --> 01:06:29.053
just the corrupt power
tripping ones like you.

1234
01:06:30.345 --> 01:06:32.273
See. while you all. how'd you put it.

1235
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.443
call it as you see it.

1236
01:06:36.267 --> 01:06:38.853
I call it how it really is.

1237
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.280
- It's not too late to save Sienna.

1238
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:51.410
If you're truly sorry
for taking my boy's life.

1239
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:54.473
then please don't take any
more of my family from us.

1240
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.912
I know her father

1241
01:06:57.912 --> 01:07:02.103
and he loves her just as much
as you love your daughter.

1242
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.283
Don't rob him of a life with her.

1243
01:07:08.787 --> 01:07:09.870
Listen.

1244
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:13.193
I'll trade my testimony for Sienna's life.

1245
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.693
You gotta know it's the only way. right?

1246
01:07:20.216 --> 01:07:24.083
- I won't trade my life for
a situation you put me in.

1247
01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.773
I won't go down for this.

1248
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.053
- Your only hope is to do the right thing.

1249
01:07:31.225 --> 01:07:32.083
- You're right.

1250
01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:37.520
Once again. I'm the one left
making all the hard choices.

1251
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.330
It's time for me to clean up this mess.

1252
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.163
Sit down!

1253
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:55.290
- [Female Speaker] Your last
chance for a double shot

1254
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:56.610
extra caramel macchiato.

1255
01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:57.830
- [Detective Saks] Yeah. no.

1256
01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:59.580
Plus. I need to check in on Pearce.

1257
01:08:09.016 --> 01:08:09.849
- [Jason] Hello?

1258
01:08:09.849 --> 01:08:12.000
- Pearce. hey!

1259
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.833
- [Jason] Saks.

1260
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.290
I fucked up.

1261
01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.070
- Brother. we all fuck up sometimes. man.

1262
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:20.270
What's going on?

1263
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.852
- No.

1264
01:08:21.852 --> 01:08:23.110
This is bad.

1265
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.971
- Just breathe okay. honey?

1266
01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:26.120
- [Jason] I'm losing everything.

1267
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.953
- Hey. you know what?

1268
01:08:26.953 --> 01:08:27.786
Half of these lawsuits

1269
01:08:27.786 --> 01:08:29.010
are settled outside of court anyway. man.

1270
01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:29.860
Everything will be fine.

1271
01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.693
Trust me.

1272
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:35.350
- Court's the least of my worries now.

1273
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.722
- Okay. well. Jessica's been calling me.

1274
01:08:39.722 --> 01:08:40.560
We're worried.

1275
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.770
I mean. you want me to come pick you up?

1276
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:43.780
You gotta sleep this one off or what?

1277
01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.503
- I just had to set things right.

1278
01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:49.563
I just wanted to talk. not this.

1279
01:08:50.427 --> 01:08:52.480
I shouldn't have come.

1280
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.133
- Pearce. where are you right now?

1281
01:08:55.291 --> 01:08:56.891
- I never meant for any of this.

1282
01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:00.353
Saks.
- What?

1283
01:09:01.476 --> 01:09:06.003
- If anything happens to
me. you remember our deal.

1284
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.110
- Our deal?

1285
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:12.200
Pearce. what are you say--
(phone beeping)

1286
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.200
What the hell are you talking about?

1287
01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.033
Our deal?

1288
01:09:16.896 --> 01:09:17.729
(phone ringing)
- Just keep your head back.

1289
01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:18.853
It's gonna be okay.

1290
01:09:20.067 --> 01:09:23.067
(Sienna whimpering)

1291
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.910
- Come on.

1292
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:29.743
Shit.

1293
01:09:32.828 --> 01:09:35.302
(horn honking)

1294
01:09:35.302 --> 01:09:36.523
Hey. come on. let's go!

1295
01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:39.958
(horn honking)

1296
01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:45.930
Come on. let's go!
- What?

1297
01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:46.763
- Let's go!

1298
01:09:46.763 --> 01:09:48.273
- I just ordered a coffee!
- Let's move!

1299
01:09:50.415 --> 01:09:51.248
Our deal?

1300
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.543
- You know. you owe me $6.

1301
01:09:55.543 --> 01:09:58.060
That was a caramel
latte I was waiting for.

1302
01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.323
- Our deal. our deal?

1303
01:09:59.323 --> 01:10:00.900
What the hell are you up to. Pearce?

1304
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.733
- Our deal?

1305
01:10:01.733 --> 01:10:02.800
What is our deal?

1306
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.340
- Shit. he's gotta be
in some kind of trouble

1307
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.460
because he said if anything
were to ever go down.

1308
01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.990
I'm supposed to take care of his family

1309
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:09.280
and he'd take care of mine.

1310
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.113
That's our deal.

1311
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:12.810
So that means some kind
of shit's going down.

1312
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:14.880
That's what that means.

1313
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.120
So we need to head back to the office.

1314
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.250
We'll get you a coffee some other time.

1315
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.540
You gonna be all right?

1316
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.393
- Oh. fuck you.

1317
01:10:22.032 --> 01:10:22.865
- Get up.

1318
01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:26.584
Get down. get down.

1319
01:10:29.715 --> 01:10:30.548
Come here.
- No!

1320
01:10:30.548 --> 01:10:34.520
- Get over there!
(Imani yelling)

1321
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.603
- [Imani] No!

1322
01:10:37.038 --> 01:10:39.205
- [Jason] Fuck over there!

1323
01:10:40.214 --> 01:10:45.214
(Sienna whimpering)
(intense music)

1324
01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.450
(Jason screaming)

1325
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:52.742
- [Detective Saks] Sit
tight. I'll be right back.

1326
01:10:52.742 --> 01:10:55.080
- Can you grab me a--
(door slamming)

1327
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.913
A coffee?

1328
01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.973
Thanks. partner.

1329
01:11:03.428 --> 01:11:04.261
- Come on.

1330
01:11:05.914 --> 01:11:10.914
(phone ringing)
(people chattering)

1331
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:35.410
- Hey. Saks.

1332
01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:36.710
I didn't think you'd be here.

1333
01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:38.100
Since you are. do you want
to take a look at this?

1334
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:38.933
- You know what?

1335
01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:39.766
I'm actually off the clock.

1336
01:11:39.766 --> 01:11:41.070
I'm just looking into something.

1337
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:42.580
- Yeah. all right.

1338
01:11:48.277 --> 01:11:53.277
(phone ringing)
(people chattering)

1339
01:11:56.291 --> 01:12:01.291
(phone ringing)
(phone vibrating)

1340
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.070
- Hello?

1341
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.930
- Hey. Jessica.

1342
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:07.763
Hey. it's Saks.

1343
01:12:07.763 --> 01:12:09.620
Listen. sorry to bother you.

1344
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.503
- Saks. what time is it?

1345
01:12:11.503 --> 01:12:14.670
- I was just wondering if
you'd heard from Pearce.

1346
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.270
- Not since I talked to you.

1347
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:17.120
What's happening?

1348
01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:19.203
- Nothing.

1349
01:12:19.203 --> 01:12:20.860
It's probably nothing.

1350
01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.650
- You would be calling me at this time

1351
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.780
if it wasn't something.

1352
01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.613
What's going on?

1353
01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:28.768
- Pearce called me
earlier. sounded worried.

1354
01:12:28.768 --> 01:12:31.636
kinda like he got himself into
some trouble or something.

1355
01:12:31.636 --> 01:12:32.564
And then he just hung up

1356
01:12:32.564 --> 01:12:33.844
and I've just been
trying to call his phone

1357
01:12:33.844 --> 01:12:36.004
and I just get voicemail. that's all.

1358
01:12:36.004 --> 01:12:37.671
- Well. where is he?

1359
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:39.783
- You know what?

1360
01:12:39.783 --> 01:12:40.616
I'm not sure.

1361
01:12:40.616 --> 01:12:42.770
but I have an idea and
I'm gonna go check it out.

1362
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:43.603
- Okay.

1363
01:12:43.603 --> 01:12:44.670
Well. call me when you find him.

1364
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.353
- Absolutely.

1365
01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:01.968
(suspenseful music)

1366
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.103
- I need rope. zap straps.
anything to tie you up.

1367
01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:18.083
- We don't have any of that stuff.

1368
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.650
- Well then get me shoelaces.

1369
01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:23.973
Now!

1370
01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.180
Come on. hurry.

1371
01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.737
There isn't much time.

1372
01:13:29.737 --> 01:13:30.570
- What do you mean there isn't much time?

1373
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:31.403
- Sit down.

1374
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.713
- So. what now?

1375
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:40.930
You're just gonna let my girl
bleed out and kill us all?

1376
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.680
Is that part of the master plan?

1377
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:47.490
- Yeah. something like that.

1378
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.340
- Don't make it worse.

1379
01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.210
- He ain't gonna kill us. pops.

1380
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.212
He's have done it already.

1381
01:13:53.212 --> 01:13:54.780
Punk bitch.

1382
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.020
Why tie us up?

1383
01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.070
- That's enough. kid.

1384
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:58.970
unless you want to be the first to go.

1385
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.583
Hurry up!

1386
01:14:07.287 --> 01:14:08.120
Sit down.

1387
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.834
Unlace all of these.

1388
01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:12.917
Go on. hurry.

1389
01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.363
Okay. you tie him up first.

1390
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:29.733
No. not in front.

1391
01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.753
Behind.

1392
01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:34.189
Don't play games with me.

1393
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.982
Good.

1394
01:14:48.073 --> 01:14:49.823
Okay. you do him now.

1395
01:14:55.749 --> 01:15:00.272
(Dom grunting)
(Imani gasping)

1396
01:15:00.272 --> 01:15:02.423
Are you messing with me?

1397
01:15:02.423 --> 01:15:03.630
Are you messing with me?!

1398
01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:04.910
- No.

1399
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:07.050
- Tie him up tighter.

1400
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:08.450
Tie him up tighter.
- Okay.

1401
01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.007
- Okay. now you do him.

1402
01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.303
Hey. no. wait here. no. turn around.

1403
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:34.267
Turn around.

1404
01:15:37.873 --> 01:15:38.873
- It's okay.

1405
01:15:44.182 --> 01:15:45.465
Okay.

1406
01:15:45.465 --> 01:15:47.548
Now. sit down back there.

1407
01:15:51.606 --> 01:15:53.960
(phone ringing)

1408
01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.793
Fuck.

1409
01:15:57.718 --> 01:15:59.814
(phone ringing)

1410
01:15:59.814 --> 01:16:00.964
- You're a popular guy.

1411
01:16:03.627 --> 01:16:04.823
- Not a fucking word.

1412
01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:08.530
(phone ringing)

1413
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:09.910
Jess?

1414
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:10.910
- Jason. what's going on?

1415
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:11.743
Saks called me.

1416
01:16:11.743 --> 01:16:12.576
Are you in trouble?

1417
01:16:12.576 --> 01:16:13.713
What have you gotten yourself into?

1418
01:16:13.713 --> 01:16:17.173
- I made a mistake and now
I'm paying for a bad decision.

1419
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:20.190
- What did you do?

1420
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.193
- All I've ever done was try
to protect you and Callie.

1421
01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.503
to give you a proper life
different from theirs.

1422
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:32.993
- You're scaring me. Jason.

1423
01:16:34.402 --> 01:16:35.860
- Just listen to me. okay?

1424
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.693
Just listen.

1425
01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:41.691
I haven't told everyone the truth.

1426
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.650
I haven't told the whole truth.

1427
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.873
- [Dom] What is the real truth?!

1428
01:16:46.873 --> 01:16:48.810
That you planted that gun on Trey?!

1429
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:50.090
- Who is that?

1430
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.923
Where are you?

1431
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.373
- Jess. Jess. I have to go.

1432
01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:57.180
- No. don't you hang up on me.

1433
01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.013
Callie?

1434
01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:58.860
It's papa.

1435
01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:01.864
He's on the phone and
he wants to talk to you.

1436
01:17:01.864 --> 01:17:02.697
- Don't do this.

1437
01:17:02.697 --> 01:17:04.364
- [Jessica] Take it.

1438
01:17:05.612 --> 01:17:08.695
- [Callie] Papa. are you coming home?

1439
01:17:11.414 --> 01:17:12.247
- Callie.

1440
01:17:14.532 --> 01:17:16.520
You should be in bed.

1441
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.670
Could you put mommy back
on the phone please?

1442
01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:20.873
- I was sleeping. silly.

1443
01:17:20.873 --> 01:17:22.990
Mommy woke me up.

1444
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:24.466
I have a recital.

1445
01:17:24.466 --> 01:17:25.716
Are you coming?

1446
01:17:27.949 --> 01:17:30.487
- I'm sorry. princess. I can't come.

1447
01:17:30.487 --> 01:17:32.440
I have to go on a trip.

1448
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.940
- Where are you going?

1449
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.983
Can I come?

1450
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.870
- No. baby. you can't come on this trip.

1451
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.103
I have to go alone for
a little while. okay?

1452
01:17:43.103 --> 01:17:45.393
But I'm gonna come home real soon.

1453
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.380
Listen. I want you to be a big girl

1454
01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.478
and you take care of mommy for me.

1455
01:17:52.478 --> 01:17:54.330
Can you do that. princess?

1456
01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:56.283
- Okay. papa. I will.

1457
01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.473
- Good.

1458
01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:04.270
I love you. Callie.
- Love you. papa.

1459
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:06.040
- Papa. he loves you so much. okay?

1460
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.690
You go back to sleep. okay honey?

1461
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:11.700
Jason. what's happening?

1462
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.373
You can't run away from us.

1463
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.316
She needs you.

1464
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:19.283
I need you.

1465
01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.510
- Everything I did was to protect us.

1466
01:18:25.087 --> 01:18:27.087
I won't let these people ruin our lives.

1467
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:31.730
If it wasn't this kid. it
would have been another.

1468
01:18:32.569 --> 01:18:34.520
(mumbles)

1469
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.420
- Let him speak.

1470
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.253
He's digging his own grave.

1471
01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:39.250
- What difference does it
make if he runs his mouth?

1472
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:40.370
Ain't nobody gonna believe us.

1473
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.993
- You're right. son.

1474
01:18:41.993 --> 01:18:44.160
but they will believe him.

1475
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:46.767
Look.

1476
01:18:46.767 --> 01:18:48.620
We had 'em installed after Trey.

1477
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.220
Your mother wanted to feel safe.

1478
01:18:51.473 --> 01:18:54.473
(suspenseful music)

1479
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.193
- Jess.

1480
01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:09.143
I have to go.

1481
01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.940
I love you. both of you. to no end.

1482
01:19:15.603 --> 01:19:16.436
I'm sorry.

1483
01:19:17.597 --> 01:19:20.264
(phone beeping)

1484
01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:26.980
(suspenseful music)

1485
01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.813
- No. no!

1486
01:19:29.387 --> 01:19:30.760
- Is that recording?

1487
01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.004
- It looks to be your confession.

1488
01:19:33.004 --> 01:19:38.004
- Fuck!

1489
01:19:39.972 --> 01:19:44.972
(Jason grunting)
(Imani whimpering)

1490
01:19:45.991 --> 01:19:47.536
Where is the recording?

1491
01:19:47.536 --> 01:19:49.253
Tell me where the fuck it is!

1492
01:19:49.253 --> 01:19:50.730
- I wouldn't know anything about it.

1493
01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:51.793
Sorry. officer.

1494
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.710
- [Jason] Maybe a bullet to
your pop's head will make you--

1495
01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:56.710
- No!

1496
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:58.920
- You hurt him or any
other member of my family.

1497
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.080
I swear to god. I will personally--

1498
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.363
- Personally do what?!

1499
01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:04.366
Huh?!

1500
01:20:06.019 --> 01:20:08.270
- Leave him alone!

1501
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.020
- Pops will be easier to convince.

1502
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.222
Get up!
- No. no!

1503
01:20:11.222 --> 01:20:12.055
- Get the fuck up.

1504
01:20:12.055 --> 01:20:13.555
- No.
- Let him go!

1505
01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:15.975
Let him go. man!

1506
01:20:15.975 --> 01:20:20.513
(Imani crying)
(Sienna moaning)

1507
01:20:20.513 --> 01:20:22.520
- It's gonna be okay.

1508
01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.490
Hang in there.

1509
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:24.323
We're gonna help.

1510
01:20:24.323 --> 01:20:25.156
Okay. honey?
- Leave him alone!

1511
01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:27.794
Hey!

1512
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.920
- It looks like it's
just you and I Monday.

1513
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:41.740
so what do you say we
just make this simple?

1514
01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.710
You tell me where the recording is.

1515
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.993
I'll leave and you guys are safe.

1516
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.600
- No one's safe with you on those streets.

1517
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.860
- No one else needs to get hurt.

1518
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.030
Just tell me where the
fucking recording is

1519
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:57.330
and let's be done with it!

1520
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:02.290
- Kill us all.

1521
01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.990
but your confession will be heard.

1522
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.120
You have no power in this house.

1523
01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.433
Leave now and make a run
for it while you still can.

1524
01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.620
- One last time.

1525
01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.864
Tell me now or your wife is next in line

1526
01:21:18.864 --> 01:21:21.987
and I will take everything from you.

1527
01:21:24.015 --> 01:21:25.598
- You already have.

1528
01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.133
You killed my boy and you're
not getting away from that.

1529
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:34.590
You have nowhere to run.

1530
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.423
It's over.

1531
01:21:41.045 --> 01:21:43.295
(thudding)

1532
01:21:50.295 --> 01:21:52.712
- Yeah. we'll see about that.

1533
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:59.810
Okay.

1534
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:00.643
Who's next?

1535
01:22:00.643 --> 01:22:01.875
- What did you do to my pops?

1536
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:02.708
- No!

1537
01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:04.490
- The same thing I'm gonna do to your mom

1538
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:06.826
if you don't fucking speak up.

1539
01:22:06.826 --> 01:22:08.091
- Psychotic pig!

1540
01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.820
You ain't gotta do this. man.

1541
01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:12.150
- You just don't fucking
give up. do you. kid?

1542
01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:14.053
Stay the fuck down.

1543
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.500
Okay.

1544
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.270
One more time.

1545
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:19.840
One more time.

1546
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.280
Where does that camera record to?

1547
01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.120
- I don't know!

1548
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.145
- She's telling the truth.

1549
01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:26.978
- Please.

1550
01:22:29.539 --> 01:22:32.206
(Jason yelling)

1551
01:22:36.341 --> 01:22:37.457
(furniture clattering)

1552
01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:41.720
- I will burn this fucking
house down if I have to!

1553
01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.100
That footage is not getting out.

1554
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:46.997
so speak the fuck up now!

1555
01:22:54.187 --> 01:22:55.783
No?

1556
01:22:55.783 --> 01:22:56.948
No?

1557
01:22:56.948 --> 01:23:01.890
- No. no!
(Sienna yelling)

1558
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:03.650
- Are you listening now?

1559
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:04.794
Huh?

1560
01:23:04.794 --> 01:23:06.311
- All right!

1561
01:23:06.311 --> 01:23:07.311
Enough. man!

1562
01:23:10.009 --> 01:23:11.550
That's enough.

1563
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:12.910
I'll show you.

1564
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:14.583
- No. son. he'll just kill us.

1565
01:23:15.794 --> 01:23:17.570
- Just let him go.

1566
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:20.570
Let 'em all go and I'll
show you where it records.

1567
01:23:21.571 --> 01:23:24.377
You ain't gonna find it without me. man.

1568
01:23:25.504 --> 01:23:29.013
(Jason laughing)

1569
01:23:29.013 --> 01:23:31.930
(Sienna screaming)

1570
01:23:35.104 --> 01:23:37.700
- You don't have room to negotiate.

1571
01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.700
so speak up now!

1572
01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.663
- Stop!

1573
01:23:42.432 --> 01:23:43.673
I have the clips.

1574
01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:45.750
It's right here.

1575
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:46.583
- Pops. no!

1576
01:23:47.426 --> 01:23:48.870
- Ethan.

1577
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:50.870
- Just let my family go.

1578
01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.787
- Finally. something
smart from one of you.

1579
01:24:03.597 --> 01:24:06.880
You people are stubborn as fucking hell.

1580
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.773
all of you!

1581
01:24:18.437 --> 01:24:20.963
You know I have to kill all of you. right?

1582
01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.890
- Look. you have what you want.

1583
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.243
Just leave us alone.

1584
01:24:27.885 --> 01:24:29.968
- You still don't get it.

1585
01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:34.563
I'm doing the world a favor
getting rid of you people.

1586
01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:40.353
You're poison. an infection.

1587
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.490
See. I never had a problem with
your kind until I moved here

1588
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:49.120
and started watching you steal. and loot.

1589
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.120
and kill each other.

1590
01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:53.103
and breed where you don't belong.

1591
01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:55.903
- That's why you killed my brother?

1592
01:24:57.082 --> 01:24:57.915
Huh?

1593
01:24:57.915 --> 01:24:59.860
- I killed your brother
because he was a criminal.

1594
01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.310
He was guilty from the moment

1595
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:04.380
he decided to hang out
at all hours of the night

1596
01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.400
with a bunch of gang bangers.

1597
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.320
drinking. causing trouble.
stealing. breaking into cars.

1598
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.030
anything that gave him money
without working for it.

1599
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.480
See. that's your fucking M-O.

1600
01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:20.209
I work protecting you thugs
while you live off my money.

1601
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:22.580
Huh?

1602
01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.930
Hardly seems fair. does it?

1603
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.013
- Trey wasn't a criminal.

1604
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:30.810
You planted that gun.

1605
01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:32.633
You. and you alone!

1606
01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:34.853
Covert or not.

1607
01:25:35.924 --> 01:25:36.883
you're racist.

1608
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.673
- Yeah.

1609
01:25:40.521 --> 01:25:45.014
Well. I guess we'll never know.

1610
01:25:45.014 --> 01:25:46.847
Okay. enough chatting.

1611
01:25:48.948 --> 01:25:50.435
Who's first?

1612
01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:51.845
- You. mother--
(gunshot blasting)

1613
01:25:51.845 --> 01:25:52.678
- No. no!

1614
01:25:54.647 --> 01:25:59.647
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1615
01:26:00.299 --> 01:26:03.879
- (crying) No. baby.

1616
01:26:03.879 --> 01:26:06.383
(Ethan grunting)
Baby.

1617
01:26:06.383 --> 01:26:11.383
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1618
01:26:14.865 --> 01:26:19.767
(glass shattering)
(thudding)

1619
01:26:19.767 --> 01:26:23.483
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1620
01:26:23.483 --> 01:26:26.312
(Ethan grunting)
Are you okay?

1621
01:26:26.312 --> 01:26:27.748
- Go help Sienna.

1622
01:26:27.748 --> 01:26:30.498
(Ethan grunting)

1623
01:26:32.091 --> 01:26:32.924
- No. no.

1624
01:26:35.308 --> 01:26:40.308
(men grunting)
(intense music)

1625
01:27:01.329 --> 01:27:03.600
(gunshot blasting)

1626
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.433
- Fuck!

1627
01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:07.950
(Dom grunting)

1628
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:09.234
- Give me the card.

1629
01:27:09.234 --> 01:27:10.317
- Go to hell!

1630
01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.593
- Give me the fucking card!

1631
01:27:21.293 --> 01:27:23.043
You're a stupid fuck!

1632
01:27:24.142 --> 01:27:25.903
You just couldn't leave it alone!

1633
01:27:27.717 --> 01:27:30.293
I just wanted to be with my family.

1634
01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:36.000
No one forced you into the fucking ghetto.

1635
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.950
This place became the ghetto
when you people moved in here.

1636
01:27:40.133 --> 01:27:42.500
Your fucking homeland is a diseased

1637
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.400
fucked up war torn wasteland

1638
01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.553
because that's what happens
when you're left to yourselves.

1639
01:27:50.775 --> 01:27:53.097
And now you want to do it to my country?!

1640
01:27:54.897 --> 01:27:57.643
And my daughter will have
to grow up without a father.

1641
01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:01.203
you stupid fucking nigger!

1642
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.790
- A spade is a spade. huh?

1643
01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:13.916
Get off me. man.

1644
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.223
- Hey. Pearce.

1645
01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:22.960
What are you doing here. brother?

1646
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.060
- Hey. he's got a gun.

1647
01:28:24.957 --> 01:28:26.407
- [Jason] It wasn't my fault.

1648
01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:29.220
- Look. I'm not sure
what's going on. okay.

1649
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.263
but I'm sure we'll work it out. okay?

1650
01:28:35.172 --> 01:28:36.403
- It wasn't my fault!

1651
01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.940
- There's no need for the gun.

1652
01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:44.170
- Pearce. did you hear her?

1653
01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:45.520
Just drop the weapon. okay?

1654
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:51.900
Pearce. drop the weapon.

1655
01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:53.770
Like I said. I'm not sure
what's happening right now.

1656
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:57.280
but this. this isn't the answer. okay?

1657
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.140
You gotta be smart here.

1658
01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.580
You gotta think. okay?

1659
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.480
Think about Jessica. all right?

1660
01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.590
Think about Callie.

1661
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:03.740
Can you do that for me?

1662
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.630
- You remember our deal?

1663
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:11.443
- What?

1664
01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:16.880
- Remember our deal!

1665
01:29:18.242 --> 01:29:19.075
- Don't.

1666
01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:21.858
Don't!
- Don't do it!

1667
01:29:29.918 --> 01:29:34.918
(people chattering)
(sneakers squeaking)

1668
01:29:46.558 --> 01:29:47.391
- Trey!

1669
01:29:48.353 --> 01:29:49.787
Trey. come on!

1670
01:29:49.787 --> 01:29:50.954
Come on. Trey!

1671
01:29:53.778 --> 01:29:55.350
- Don't move!

1672
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:57.410
On your knees. hands on your head!

1673
01:29:57.410 --> 01:30:00.062
On your knees. hands on your head!

1674
01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:01.762
On your knees. hands on your head!

1675
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:05.490
Now. don't do it. don't do it!

1676
01:30:09.617 --> 01:30:12.617
(gunshots blasting)

1677
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:58.037
(siren blaring)

1678
01:31:05.538 --> 01:31:06.771
Hey. hey.

1679
01:31:06.771 --> 01:31:08.938
(mumbles)

1680
01:31:16.335 --> 01:31:17.353
- Dom!

1681
01:31:17.353 --> 01:31:22.353
(Imani crying)
(Dom wincing)

1682
01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:42.868
- Sienna. Sienna?

1683
01:31:42.868 --> 01:31:43.951
- She's okay.

1684
01:31:46.579 --> 01:31:49.662
(somber piano music)

1685
01:32:25.349 --> 01:32:29.766
(moves to downbeat orchestral music)
