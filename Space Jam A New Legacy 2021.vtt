Good luck out there today.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Thanks.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hey.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You know. if I could.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I would be in those stands
cheering for my baby.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I know. Next game.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Hey. Bron?

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000

-Love you. Ma.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I love you too. baby.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
-All right. Go kill it.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Reaching for the stars

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
To another...

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What's up. Bron?

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What's up. Malik?

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Check it out. It's for you.

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My dad got me
the new color one.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh. and if
it freezes up on you.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
just smack it really hard.

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
-Works every time.
-Thanks. man.

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
-Let's go get this win.

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Phew!

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Eh. what's up. Doc?

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Hey. where Bron at?

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
LeBron James!

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Eh. what's up...

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
-What the hell is this?
-Oh. snap!

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
"Oh. snap" nothing. man.

34
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Get your tail on the court
right now! Whatchu doing?

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Hey. hey. hey!

36
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Iso! Iso for Bron!

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Nobody else shoot the ball.

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
All right. Bron.
you keep that ball!

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You shoot the ball.

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
-Iso! Iso! Iso!
- You know what to do.

41
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
baby. Let's go.
It's your world.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
-Damn! Damn!

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's all right.
it's all right.

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Damn!

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Come on. line up.
Line up in front of me.

46
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Line up right here
in front of me.

47
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Listen. man.

48
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm not even disappointed

49
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
about us
losing the game tonight

50
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
'cause it's not about that.

51
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's about you giving your all.

52
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and you didn't do that tonight.

53
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
LeBron.

54
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You wasn't focused.

55
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Getting your head in the game

56
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
starts before you even put
one foot on the court.

57
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It starts before you even
get to the gym.

58
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
-But everybody on the team
plays video game--

59
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This ain't about everybody.
this is about you.

60
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Listen. you're
the best basketball player

61
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I ever coached.

62
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You could be
a once-in-a-generation talent

63
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
if you focus on the game
of basketball and not these

64
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
distractions.

65
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You can't be great without
putting in work. right?

66
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You got the chance
to use basketball

67
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to change everything.

68
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
For your mom. for you.

69
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
for everybody
who you care about.

70
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You want that?

71
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
LeBron James
has an NBA body.

72
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Six-seven and a half.
240 pounds...

73
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
plus he has got
the complete package.

74
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
With the first pick

75
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in the 2003 NBA draft.

76
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the Cleveland Cavaliers
select LeBron James.

77

-[crowd cheering]

78
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There he is
with his mom. Gloria.

79
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The kid is the king

80
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The box fit in a ring

81
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
A fantasized matchup

82
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
With my foot on the line

83
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Too big to fill

84
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
At the bottom of C-SPAN

85
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
For you fans in Cleveland...

86
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And the NBA
Most Valuable Player

87
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
goes to...

88
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And this fall. I'm gonna take
my talents to South Beach.

89
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
LeBron James
with his first field goal

90
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as a member of the Miami Heat.

91
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The Most Valuable
Player trophy

93
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The 2013 NBA Championship

94
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
resides once again in Miami!

95
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I will not just shut up
and dribble.

96
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Can't block me...

97
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We in the White House
right now. This is like...

98
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Mom. I made it.

99
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
LeBron James
is going back to Cleveland.

100
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'mma do

101
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
what makes my city happy.

102
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I love you. I'm back!

103
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
LeBron James
makes a great American story.

104
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Oh. blocked by James!
It's over!

105
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Cleveland!

106
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This is for you!

107
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
LeBron James
is a Los Angeles Laker.

108
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Here comes LeBron!

109
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
My goodness.

110
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.

111
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Two seconds to go.

112
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
James. a buzzer beater!

113
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
-You bet!

114
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Right at tip-off

115
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
On me. prepare for liftoff

116
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You can't rip off

117
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Through the struggle

118
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Through every pitfall

119
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Sleepwalking with...

120
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So how much more work
does your video game need?

121
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's been months.

122
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's almost ready.

123
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Like how you're
almost ready to tell Dad

124
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
about the E3 Game Camp
next weekend?

125
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I'm waiting on the right time.

126
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Honestly. I just think
you should rip

127
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the Band-Aid off and ask him.

128
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You're just saying that
'cause he says yes

129
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to everything you ask.

130
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
That's 'cause I'm nice.

131
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
-You're not that nice.
-That's big talk.

132
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
See if you can back it up.

133
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Come on.
let's see what you can do.

134
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
All right.
Don't get crossed.

135
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Oh! Gotcha!

136
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
- Yeah. okay.

137
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
-Come on. bro.
-

138
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Dom.

139
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
What was that?

140
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
An open shot.

141
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And if you're gonna be
out here.

142
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
it's about giving everything
that you got.

143
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And not whatever that was.

144
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Where's your fundamentals?

145
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We having fun.

146
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Everything in between
these four lines

147
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is work.

148
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Who said I wasn't working?

149
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
-This thing right here.
-

150
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Told you not to bring
that out here.

151
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Come on. Dom.
This isn't a game.

152
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
-I need you focusing more...
-

153
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
...instead of playing
with these toys.

154
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Darius. chill out.

155
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You know
I got full court vision.

156
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
How does he do that?

157
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Ball.

158
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Show me that step-back move
I taught you.

159
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You got this. son.

160
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
-In and out. Crossover.
- In and out.

161
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Step back.

162
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Come on. Dom.
You gotta concentrate.

163
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Darius. show him the move.

164
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Watch me.

165
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000

166
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
In and out. Crossover.
Step back. Shoot.

167
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yep. See.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
-Ow!

171
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Dom. Focus.

172
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You got basketball camp

173
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000

Oh. we quitting
on each other now?

176
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Can't be great
without putting in work.

177
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
All right. That's my guy.

178
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Let's get some work done.

179
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Enough of these games.

180
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Okay. I'm ready.

181
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000

182
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Y'all can't stay out here
all day.

183
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It's dinnertime.

184
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Oh. man.

185
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Really. Bron?

186
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
What are we having for dinner?

187
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Spaghetti and meatball?

188
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Ow!

189
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
-Ooh. that's my favorite.
- Damn!

190
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We talked about you
affirming Dom more.

191
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Spending some
unstructured time with him.

192
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We was just outside.

193
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I mean.
how much more spontaneous

194
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
do you want me to be?

195
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Babe. I am worried

196
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that you are pushing him
too hard.

197
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I mean.
the kid keep telling me

198
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
he want the best coaching

199
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so he can be the best player
on the court.

200
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Have you thought
about talking to your son

201
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
about something
other than basketball?

202
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Like what?

203
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Like how Dom
built a video game.

204
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
He's 12
and he built his own game.

205
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Yeah. I know.
I mean. that's great.

206
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I mean.
but if I don't push him.

207
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
if I don't stay on him.

208
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
-all the distractions--
-He doesn't need a coach.

209
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
He needs his dad.

210
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
LeBron James. a hit.

211
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
James...
-  LeBron James...

212
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I've searched far and wide

213
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
for the perfect partner
for this launch.

214
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and I've finally found him.

215
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
LeBron James.

216
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Pete. he's a family man.

217
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
an entrepreneur.

218
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
a social media superstar

219
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
with millions of fans
worldwide.

220
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Algorithmically speaking.
he's more than an athlete.

221
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
He's a king.

222
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I know I'm just
an algorithm. Pete.

223
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
That's precisely
why I need King James.

224
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I'm stuck
inside the Serververse.

225
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
No one knows who I am
or what I do.

226
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But that all changes today.

227
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Because today.
Warner Bros. launches

228
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the revolutionary technology
that I masterminded.

229
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Today.

230
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
it's my time to shine.

231
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Just look at this guy. Pete.

232
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Oh. he is the key element
to this entire operation.

233
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Once I partner with King James

234
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and combine his fame
with my incredible tech...

235
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I will finally get
the recognition and respect

236
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that I so richly deserve.

237
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
LeBron James. get ready.

238
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Oh. hello.

239
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
A new idea from the algorithm.

240
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I'm listening.

241
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I want it more

242
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
To settle the score

243
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I want it more

244
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
To settle the score

245
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Taking over

246
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I want it more

247
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
To settle the score

248
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
on the pavement

249
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Out of them cages...

250
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
-

251
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Hey. son.

252
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
What you doing?

253
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Um. just building my game.

254
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Is this the one
you've been working on?

255
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Actually. it's basically done.
but I...

256
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Here. Just...

257
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I still have to figure out
some of the player designs.

258
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Whoa.
Who are those guys?

259
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Oh. those are
people around the world

260
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
tuning in to my livestream.
It's pretty cool. huh?

261
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Okay.

262
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And this is how it works.
You do combos and moves.

263
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and the better you do.
the more people tune in.

264
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Let me see
a couple of those combo moves.

265
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Crossover. Foul line!

266
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Oh. that was nice.

267
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
-Ooh! Posterized!
-Posterized?

268
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Is this not real basketball?

269
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Well. I put a spin to it.

270
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
You can get style points.

271
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
-Power-ups.
-  Count it!

272
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's like basketball.
but better.

273
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
You just play for fun.
Remember fun. Dad?

274
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Tsk. I am fun.

275
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Man. give me that.

276
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Show you how fun I am.

277
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Kick your butt in this game.

278
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Dang. I miss this. man.
I ain't...

279
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
-Whoa.
-  Gimme dat!

280
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Were you trying
to do my move?

281
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Yeah. I put it in the game.

282
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
In and out.
Crossover. Step back.

283
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Let it go.

284
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Uh-oh!

285
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
No.
-

286
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Why... Why he freeze?

287
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
No. no. no.

288
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Man. can you fix it?
'Cause I don't want--

289
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Hey. don't try
to blame me for that.

290
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
No. No. no.
Don't erase my char...

291
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
My entire character is gone.

292
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's gonna take me at least
a week to rebuild this.

293
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Listen. son.

294
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Setbacks happen.

295
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Adversity is a part of
the process. man.

296
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But if you're passionate
about something.

297
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
you gotta learn
how to push through it.

298
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You got me?

299
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Hey. I think
I've got something

300
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that will cheer you up.

301
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I'm meeting at Warner Bros.

302
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
about some
high-tech movie thing.

303
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You should come. Cool?

304
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Yeah. Dad.

305
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Oh. snap.

306
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Did Dad just come up
with a dope idea?

307
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Please don't dab.

308
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Oh. what'd you just say?

309
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Did you just say.
"Please. Dad. dab"?

310
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
-No. I said...
-Dab.

311
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Uncle Malik will be here
in 15. Let's roll.

312
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's called Warner 3000

313
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and it's supposed to be
next level!

314
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
This could be the new wave!

315
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Hello. I'm Al G. Rhythm.

316
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And as you might have guessed.

317
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I am an algorithm
here at Warner Bros.

318
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The studio
behind all the classics.

319
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
But now. it's time for
our greatest creation yet.

320
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Warner 3000.

321
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
-This will revolutionize

322
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
the entire
entertainment industry.

323
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and we want you
to be on our team. King James.

324
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Now. we know you're busy.

325
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
but we can make it
very easy for you.

326
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Because our brand new
Warner 3000 technology

327
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
will scan you
right into the movies.

328
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Oh. it's like looking
into a mirror. huh. LeBron?

329
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Think about it.
Batman versus LeBron.

330
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
LeBron of Thrones.

331
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
LeBron
and the Chamber of Secrets.

332
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The possibilities are endless.

333
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
You'll be
the king of Warner Bros.

334
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
That's the power
of Warner 3000.

335
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Say yes. LeBron. and together.

336
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
we'll make mind-blowing
entertainment

337
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
forever.

338
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Huh? Huh?

339
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So. what do you say?

340
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Pretty sweet. right?

341
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I mean. look at him.

342
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Look at that face.
He's speechless.

343
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
He loves it!

344
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
How about that algorithm. huh?

345
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Pretty brilliant.

346
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
He came up
with the entire presentation.

347
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I should watch my back.

348
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Yes! Thank you! Finally. huh?

349
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Put some 'spec
on my name. right?

350
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
-Oh. man.

351
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
That was. um...

352
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That was something.

353
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Right. Malik?

354
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Listen. guys.
I'm a ballplayer.

355
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You know.
and athletes acting.

356
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that never goes well.

357
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I'm sorry. guys.
This is all just...

358
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
-It's just not me.

359
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And I can't afford to take
time away from the game.

360
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Whoa. Bron.

361
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
-Let's not be too hasty here.
-Malik.

362
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Let's just hear
what they're talking about.

363
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Nah. nah. nah.

364
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
With all due respect.
with all due respect.

365
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
this idea
is just straight-up bad.

366
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
That algorithm is busted.

367
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Busted?

368
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It's among the worst
ideas I've ever heard.

369
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Top five. easily.

370
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Okay. Thank you. Thank you!

371
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
That's exactly
what I was think--

372
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
You're saying
what I'm thinking.

373
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
This is trash. this algorithm.

374
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
You're cancelled. algorithm!

375
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
What a terrible idea.
So stupid.

376
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So stupid.
This is what happens when...

377
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Pete. tell me he did not
just say "stupid"!

378
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Uh-oh.

379
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I don't know. I think
the algorithm's pretty cool.

380
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I've got a question.

381
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Is it a heuristic algorithm

382
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
or some kind of
matrix variant?

383
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Dom.
using the medulla oblongata.

384
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I think we got a little
Stevie Jobs on our hands.

385
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yeah. I'm actually building
my own video game.

386
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Oh. nice. your own video game.

387
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You heard of the E3
Game Design Camp. right?

388
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Yeah.

389
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Well. there's gonna be one
next weekend. and I'm going.

390
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
There's gonna be a whole bunch
of other coders there.

391
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Hold... Dom.

392
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I'm actually
looking forward...

393
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
No. You can't go to that.

394
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Basketball camp
is next weekend.

395
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I'm not going
to basketball camp. Dad.

396
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Dom. you don't
have to be scared.

397
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You got amazing potential
on the court.

398
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and I can help you get there.

399
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
That's not what I want. Dad.

400
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Dom.

401
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Wonderful to meet...

402
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
-Excuse me. guys.
-

403
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Dom!

404
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Hey. hey. I'mma catch you
at the car.

405
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
What?

406
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
So. is this a hard pass or...?

407
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Who does
this guy think he is? Huh?

408
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Rejecting me? Humiliating me?

409
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Okay.

410
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
All right.

411
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I tried being a team player.

412
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
but those days are over.

413
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I'm done playing
by everybody else's rules.

414
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
It is my game now.

415
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Dom!

416
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I'm your father.
When I say stop. you stop.

417
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Right this way.
King James.

418
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Dom.
do not get in that elevator!

419
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Come on. Dom.

420
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
You know I can't let you
back out of camp like that.

421
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You made a commitment.

422
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
You make me hate basketball.

423
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

424
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Everything is always
what you want.

425
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
You never let me do
what I wanna do.

426
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
You never let me just do me.

427
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
"Do me"?

428
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
You think I got to "do me"

429
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
-when I was 12?
-

430
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Hold up. Wrong floor.

431
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Warner 3000.

432
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Welcome. Dominic James.

433
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Wow. this is cool.

434
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Dom?
Stop playing. man.

435
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You know
your mom don't like it

436
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
when I don't have you home
for dinner on time.

437
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
All this computer stuff
is your thing. not mine.

438
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Dom?

439
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Dom!

440
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Dom?

441
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
What in  The Matrix  hell?

442
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Dom! What's going on?

443
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Are you okay?

444
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Yeah. I'm fine.

445
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Wow.

446
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
This must be
some kind of immersive tech

447
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
like holography

448
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
with haptic technology.
or something like VR...

449
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Dude. dude. dude.
Just tell me what's going on.

450
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Dad. I think we're digitized.

451
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
-We're in the computer!
-We're in the computer?

452
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
-Dad.
-You know I'm claustrophobic.

453
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
-Dad. chill out.
-How do we get out of here?

454
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
-Dad. Dad.
-Where's the elevators?

455
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Hey. Siri. can you let us
out of here. please?

456
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Siri?

457
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Who goes there?

458
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Who dares disturb the great
and powerful Al G.?

459
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Look at your faces.

460
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
You were terrified!

461
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Priceless.

462
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

463
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
The computer's Black.

464
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I can see that.

465
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Hello.

466
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Hi.

467
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Wow. King James.
I am a big fan.

468
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I just...

469
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I don't know. I thought
you'd be taller somehow.

470
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Hmm.

471
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
-These graphics are unreal.
-Right?

472
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Dom. don't touch
the silver computer man.

473
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
What's going on?

474
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
-And who are you. man?
-Uh...

475
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
You're right. Forgive me.
Where are my manners?

476
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
I am King Al G. Rhythm.

477
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Oh. you're that guy
from the video.

478
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And this... Ha-ha.

479
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Oh. gentlemen. this...

480
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
this is
the Warner Bros. Serververse.

481
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Just make you feel
all insignificant. don't it?

482
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Are all computers like this?

483
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Dom?

484
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
-Dom?
- Uh-oh.

485
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?

486
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Who's Dom?

487
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Dude. chill out.

488
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
You're gonna get
your son back.

489
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
There better not be a "but"
at the end of--

490
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.

491
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Like what?

492
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.

493
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
That was a mistake.

494
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Now. I'm afraid you're gonna

495
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
have to help me
fulfill my destiny.

496
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Listen. man.

497
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
if you don't produce my son
in five seconds--

498
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No. no. no.

499
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
All that pointing
and aggression.

500
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
No. no. no. You're not
running things in here.

501
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I am the king of this domain.

502
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I'm not your coach.

503
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Now. the only way you're
getting your son back

504
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
is if you and I play a little
game called basketball.

505
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
You wanna play me
in basketball?

506
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Well. you didn't wanna be
in the movies.

507
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
You wanted to
"focus on your game."

508
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Well. guess what?

509
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Now you can focus
on this game.

510
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
You and me. we're gonna
put on a show. baby.

511
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
We are gonna play a game
of basketball

512
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.

513
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
All your followers.

514
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
they're all gonna be watching.

515
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And when they see
the two of us together.

516
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I will finally step out
of the shadows

517
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
and into the light.

518
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And the entire world
is gonna know

519
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
the name of King Al G. Rhythm.

520
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
But you know what.
I'm a good sport.

521
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tell you what. if you win.

522
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.

523
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And what if I lose?

524
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Yeah. Wrinkle.

525
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
If you lose...
Well. when you lose.

526
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
you're just gonna
have to stay here

527
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in the Serververse with me...

528
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
forever and ever and ever

529
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
and ever.

530
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Oh!
-

531
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So. you better play
like you mean it.

532
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
You know.
you think this is a game.

533
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I'm calling
the authorities on you.

534
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.000
'Cause what you got
going on here--

535
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
On this phone?

536
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
How'd you do that?

537
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
LeBron. why are you worried
about the authorities

538
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
when you should be out there
looking for a team?

539
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Pete. send this clown
to the rejects.

540
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Wait...

541
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I guess he fell for it.

542
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Here's looking at you. kid.

543
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
No. no. no. no. no!

544
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
-What is happening?
-

545
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I'll get you. my pretty.

546
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
No. no.
no. no. no. no!

547
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
What is this?

548
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!

549
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
-

550
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
What the...? I'm a cartoon?

551
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Is this where the game
is gonna happen?

552
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Where is everybody?

553
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Hello?

554
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Hello?

555
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Hello?

556
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
"Rabbit season"?

557
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
-What the...?

558
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Ahh! Get away!
Leave me alone!

559
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Somebody help!

560
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
-What's up. Doc?
-

561
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Duck season!

562
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
-Bugs Bunny?
-

563
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Whoa!

564
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Bugs! I can't believe...

565
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Bring it in. man.

566
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Listen. I need your help.

567
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Eh. you missed your cue.

568
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Oh. Rabbit season.

569
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
All right. here. Now say.

570
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."

571
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
...and try to chase me.

572
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Bugs. wait!

573
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
-I should've seen that coming.
-

574
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
- Coming through!

575
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Say. have I seen you
somewhere?

576
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Hey. you're that famous
basketball guy.

577
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Come on.
aren't you LeBron James?

578
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?

579
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Of course.

580
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I may live
in a hole in the ground.

581
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
but we still get TNT.

582
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Oh. my God. is that a...?

583
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Yep. Cover your ears. Doc.

584
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Why would you do that?

585
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
-

586
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I'm a Tune. Doc.
I can survive anything.

587
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
No. no. no! Ahhh!

588
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Ouch!

589
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Ouch!
Ouch!

590
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Ouch!

591
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I do not understand
this world.

592
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Eh. my bad. Doc.

593
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
How long
have you been alone here?

594
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Alone? You're never alone

595
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
when you got friends
like mine. Doc.

596
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
-Ain't that right. Porky?
- Uh...

597
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
That's just
a pile of pumpkins.

598
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Porky. did you hear
what he just called you?

599
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
So. what brings you
to Tune World. Doc?

600
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
-Torn meniscus?

601
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
-Midlife crisis?

602
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Ran out of teams to play for?

603
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son.

604
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.

605
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
His name is Al G. Rhythm?

606
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Did you say Al G. Riddim?

607
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Yeah. that's the guy.
Rhythm. Riddim...

608
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Whatever.

609
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
That nefarious nimrod

610
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.

611
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
He kicked them out?

612
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Well. not exactly.

613
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
He buttered them up.

614
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
saying they were
wasting their time.

615
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
That there was
much more to see

616
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
in the Serververse
than old Tune World.

617
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.

618
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
They all left. all of them.

619
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.

620
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Ah. man. Sorry. Bugs.
That's terrible.

621
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Family's everything.

622
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Yep.

623
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Family.

624
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Well. Bugs Bunny.
I need to assemble

625
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
an elite team
of A-plus ballplayers

626
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
to help crush this Al G. guy.

627
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.

628
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
-Hol... Hold up. Doc.

629
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So. you want me.

630
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
a talking cartoon bunny.

631
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
to play with you.
an NBA superstar.

632
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
in a high-stakes
basketball game?

633
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Sounds awfully familiar.

634
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Who are you talking to?

635
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
But. yeah.
that actually sums it up well.

636
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.

637
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I declare this land
for planet Earth.

638
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Not so fast. furry creature.

639
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Excuse me.
-

640
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Marvin the Martian?

641
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
For real?

642
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I claim this planet
in the name of Mars.

643
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
My goodness.
My mistake. partner.

644
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I thought this land
was in the clear.

645
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Well. we'll just get back
in our ship

646
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and out of your way.

647
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Oh. it's quite all right.

648
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Everyone makes mistakes.

649
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Come on. Let's boogie.

650
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
What? You're stealing his
ship. I didn't agree to this.

651
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
My ship!

652
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Blasted rabbit.

653
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Whoa. whoa!

654
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Bugs! Help! Help! Whoa!

655
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Take this. rabbit.

656
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Back at ya.

657
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Huh?

658
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
You coming. Doc?

659
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Or would you rather hang back

660
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
with a cranky Martian
and his space mutt?

661
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Just watch out for the...

662
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Just watch out for the...

663
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
I just said. watch out for...

664
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
-Bugs!

665
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
You have
made me very angry.

666
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
-Very angry. indeed.
-

667
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
This place is awesome.

668
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
It really is.

669
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Wait. where's my dad?

670
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Your dad?

671
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Oh! He's out there
looking for a team.

672
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
-A team?
-Yeah.

673
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
He challenged me
to a basketball game.

674
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
I mean. that's weird. right?

675
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
He just left?

676
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Kind of his M.O.. right?

677
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
I mean. he left Cleveland.
he left Miami.

678
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
He left Cleveland again.

679
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Look out. Lakers. huh?

680
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Come on.
don't look so sad. Prince.

681
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I mean. you don't need

682
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
your old man
bossing you around anyway.

683
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Look at where you are.

684
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.

685
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Your old man is missing out.

686
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
It is pretty amazing.

687
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Who built this?

688
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Well. someone brilliant.

689
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Visionary.
Incredibly good looking.

690
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Modest.

691
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
With a multitudinous
vocabulary.

692
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Hint. you're looking
right at him. kid.

693
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
But all
my extraordinary gifts.

694
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
they're nothing
compared to yours.

695
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah. right.

696
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
It's true. Dom.

697
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
I saw you back there
in that boardroom

698
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
through some camera-phones.

699
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
and a printer.
and a fax machine.

700
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
and a thermostat.

701
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
It's very clear
how smart you are.

702
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
And Pete tells me
that you hate video games.

703
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
-You create video games.

704
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
-Why don't you enunciate?
-

705
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
How many times do we
have to go through this?

706
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.000
I'm the problem?

707
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

708
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
-Sorry.

709
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Heard you made
your own character. too.

710
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Yeah. but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.

711
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Ah. don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.

712
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
-You could?
-Absolutely.

713
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Make him greater than he was.

714
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You wouldn't
even have to lift a finger.

715
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.

716
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
What?

717
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Aw.

718
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Thinking of your dad again.
huh? How he's always...

719
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
"You can't be great
without putting in work."

720
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Yeah. How did you know that?

721
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I know a lot about you. Dom.

722
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Any device with a camera.
I can see you.

723
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
If it's got a mic.

724
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I can hear you.

725
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Hey. let's get a look
at that game of yours.

726
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
-

727
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Captain's log.
Captain James T. Bunny.

728
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Intergalactic space traveler
on a five-year mission.

729
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
My crew has been scattered

730
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
to the far. far reaches
of the Serververse.

731
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Marooned on strange.
inhospitable worlds.

732
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I've commandeered
Marvin's ship in an effort

733
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
to reassemble the team.

734
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Yo. Bugs.
Check it out.

735
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Look what I found.

736
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Oh. that's not good.

737
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Were you saying something?

738
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Uh. I was just asking you...

739
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Hey. what's that for. Doc?

740
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Gotta make a list.

741
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
We're gonna need
the most powerful

742
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Warner Bros. characters
for this team.

743
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Now. let's see.
Who to get? Hmm.

744
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Gotta start with Superman.

745
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Man. I could've used him
on the Cavs.

746
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.

747
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Yeah. listen. Doc...

748
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Try not to get your hopes up
too much.

749
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
You might not be able to get

750
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
all those top guys
for the team.

751
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
This ain't the Miami Heat.
you know.

752
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
We're gonna need
a strong power forward.

753
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Iron Giant.

754
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Put him on the same team
as his hero. Superman.

755
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I'm just saying
it might be good

756
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
to have a backup plan.

757
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Wow.

758
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
This Serververse is massive.

759
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
So many different worlds
to explore.

760
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I wish Dom was here
to see this.

761
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
So. how come you stayed
on Tune World?

762
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Tune World is my home.

763
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It's the only place
where I can be me.

764
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
-Where I belong.
- Yo!

765
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Is that Harry Potter World?

766
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Awesome!

767
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Hufflepuff? I knew it!

768
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Nerd alert.

769
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Oh. yeah! Metropolis.

770
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
I can't wait to see
what I turn into here.

771
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Oh. it's gonna be
somebody dope.

772
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Robin? I'm freaking Robin?

773
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
And why are we chasing
a runaway train?

774
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
We're in DC World. Doc.

775
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And where there's trouble.

776
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
-there's superheroes.
-Whoa!

777
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Hmm?

778
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Gadzooks!

779
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Some despicable villain
tied up the driver.

780
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Yeah. sorry.

781
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Unless someone
stops this thing.

782
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
-it'll crash straight into...
-

783
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
...an orphanage. Of course.

784
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
This is not good.

785
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Luckily. Super Duck
is here to save the...

786
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Cut!

787
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
What are you
doing here. rabbit?

788
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Say. we need a couple of guys
to win a basketball game.

789
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Hold up. you want these guys?

790
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Basketball?
Are you kidding me?

791
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
This stunt here
is gonna get me

792
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
into the Justice League
penthouse!

793
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
With free parking.

794
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And now. the hero.
Super Duck. who is me.

795
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
will pull this brake.
and save the day.

796
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
That's all. folks.

797
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Whoa!

798
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
The... The children!

799
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Huh?

800
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Uh. we did it?

801
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Oh. no. you don't. rabbit.

802
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I did this. It was me.

803
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I masterminded
this entire operation.

804
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
It was me!

805
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
It was him.
It was definitely the pig.

806
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Yeah. what?

807
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Any of you
play any basketball?

808
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
-

809
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
You know. on second thought.
I love basketball!

810
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Dibs on coach.

811
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
All right. we're off to a...
decent start.

812
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
But now we gotta crew up.
build our elite squad

813
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
so I can get my son back.

814
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
And that's exactly
what we'll do.

815
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
It's draft day.

816
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Beep. beep.

817
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
-Witness!
-Witness!

818
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Beep. beep.

819
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
[upbeat hip-hop music
continues playing]

820
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
This guy?

821
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Yeah. He's explosive.

822
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Beep. beep.

823
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
I know what you need.
You need a player.

824
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
-Yeah.
-Beep. beep.

825
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Yeah. baby! Yeah!

826
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
He is exactly
like you in every way.

827
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Except 1/8th your size.

828
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Sylvester. is that you?

829
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Sufferin' succotash!
What are you doing here?

830
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Can we
just get some players

831
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
who are at least tall enough
to ride a roller coaster?

832
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Sing it. Sam.

833
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Ooh. You got baggage. lady.
I can relate.

834
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
What? What?

835
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Oh. come on. man.

836
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Well. with the hat on.
he's at least 4'2".

837
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
4'3". varmint!

838
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Bugs. I'm getting the feeling

839
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
that I need to be
very literal with you.

840
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
We're done running tests
on your badger thing.

841
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
It turns out
his condition is irreversible.

842
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
I'll never erase
what I saw from my brain.

843
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
He's your problem now.
dum-dums!

844
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Yo. Bugs.
does this thing bite?

845
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Winter. I say.
winter is coming!

846
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
You know what we're missing?

847
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Everything.

848
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
We're missing everything.

849
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Some veteran leadership?

850
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
You read my mind.

851
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Police!
Hands on your head!

852
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Can't a lady
check her Twitter?

853
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Abuela.  let's do this.

854
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
What's happenin'. bro?

855
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Arriba! Arri...

856
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Mi sombrero!
Epa! Epa-epa!

857
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Neo ain't got nothing
on me. bro.

858
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Oo-hi-yah!

859
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Oh.

860
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Hi-yah! Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yay!

861
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
What did I miss?

862
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Hey. Granny.

863
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Speedy.

864
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
All right. everybody.

865
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Group picture.

866
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So. uh.
has anybody seen Tweety?

867
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
What year is this?

868
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Man! You got smelly.
Gross!

869
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
-You're kidding. right?
- Oh. Tweety!

870
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
This is not the team
I asked for.

871
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Relax. Doc.

872
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
This is the team
you wanna go up against Al G.

873
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Okay. everyone.
say cheese.

874
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Best team
in the whole wide Serververse.

875
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Mother...

876
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Fine.

877
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
But you gotta get me at least
one real ballplayer. Bugs.

878
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Just one.

879
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Well. I got just the player
you need.

880
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
A true friend of the court.

881
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Trust me. she ain't busy.

882
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Lola! Lola! Lola!

883
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Today will be
the most challenging day

884
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
of your life. Lola Bunny.

885
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
You have earned the right
to become one of us.

886
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
But first. you must pass
these final trials.

887
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I'm ready. Princess Diana.

888
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Excuse me. Pardon me.

889
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
-Pardon me.
- Down in front!

890
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

891
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Ow!
That was my toe! Watch it!

892
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
There she is. Lola!

893
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Lola! Lola!

894
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
You must complete
all the obstacles

895
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
before time runs out.

896
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Begin!

897
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
-Giddyap!
-

898
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
- Whoa!

899
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Hey. Lola.
we need your help.

900
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
We gotta play
a basketball game!

901
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Ow! Ow!

902
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Listen. I know
it's been a while. but...

903
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
I'm kind of busy here!

904
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I got this!

905
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Come on. Lola.
this is our big chance.

906
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
This is LeBron James.

907
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
How often do you get to play
with an NBA superstar?

908
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Been there. done that!

909
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Huh.
That's a good point.

910
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
But basketball
is who you are. Lola.

911
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Uh-oh.

912
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I don't play anymore.

913
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
I spent years
training for this.

914
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Do not mess it up for me.

915
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Sorry. Doc.
I guess she is busy.

916
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
We can't die here!

917
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I have to save my son!

918
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
What?

919
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Calm down. Cleveland.

920
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Lola. we need your help!

921
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
This lava is gonna be
really hot!

922
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I...

923
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I failed.

924
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
A warrior is judged
not only by her skills.

925
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
but by her values.

926
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You are now an Amazon.

927
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
-I am?

928
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
I am!

929
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Now. go with your friends.

930
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Help them win
this battle of the baskets.

931
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I will help you
deliver justice

932
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
to the one they call Al G..

933
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
and save the son of The Bron.

934
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
-Hey. guys!
- Lola!

935
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Hi. Lola.

936
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Good to see you!

937
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Yo. Bugs. you coming?

938
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

939
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
-Yeah. Bugs! Here we go.
-

940
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Nah. nah.

941
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Oh. I got the ball. Let's go.

942
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
-No.
-I got you now.

943
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Oh. Ah.

944
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Dunk-tastic!

945
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
-You dunked on me? Man...
-

946
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself. Dom.

947
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I mean.
people need to see this.

948
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
You're not just a prince.
you're a wizard.

949
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Come here.

950
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Wow.

951
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
That's Diana Taurasi.

952
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
How'd you build her?

953
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Yo. Dame!
-What's good. bro?

954
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Dad hooked me up
with some of his friends

955
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
at an NBA charity event.

956
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
I thought
maybe they could help me

957
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
with the character designs
for my game.

958
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Game?

959
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Yeah. I'm building
a video game.

960
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Okay.

961
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
You know you're gonna
need a shooter.

962
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
-and I'm that dude. so...
-Wait a minute.

963
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I'm next. because if Klay's
in it. then I'm in it.

964
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Hey. if I'm gonna be
in this game.

965
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I need a superpower
or something.

966
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Between me and you.

967
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
I need one of those
special modes.

968
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
And we can call it
"Dame Time."

969
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
-Nah. time's up. Time's up.

970
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
You guys can be
whatever you want.

971
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
It was great.

972
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
They really helped me out.

973
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Stored all the scans
right on my phone.

974
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
This phone?

975
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
So. theoretically.
this app of yours

976
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world.

977
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
using their own phones.

978
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Yeah. I guess.

979
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Pete!

980
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
-Check this out.

981
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Make sure he gets it
back though. it's his.

982
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And respect his privacy.

983
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Gotta say. though.

984
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.

985
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
I mean. I get it.

986
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.

987
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Well. the jury's still out
on that. I think.

988
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
but go ahead.

989
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
And I... build video games.

990
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Mmm.

991
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I think he doesn't...

992
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
He won't let me do me.

993
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
He won't let me be me.

994
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I'd let you be you.

995
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
You know what?

996
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
I think I know a way
we can fix this.

997
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
We're gonna
make your dad stand up

998
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
and take notice of you.
young prince.

999
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Ball.

1000
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
I need us to focus
so we can beat this Al G. guy.

1001
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
and I can get my son back.

1002
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
I'm coach.
I'll take it from here.

1003
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
The dictionary
defines basketball

1004
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
as a game

1005
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
played between
two teams of five.

1006
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Uh. look here. Cleveland.

1007
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
We got a certain way
of doing things around here.

1008
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Let's start
with the basics.

1009
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Lola. show 'em how we do it.

1010
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
You're despicable.

1011
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Simplest shot in the game.

1012
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
-Sufferin' succotash!
-Oh. wow!

1013
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Nice layup.

1014
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
That's fundamental basketball.

1015
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Fundamental basketball.

1016
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
That's what I've been saying.

1017
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Sam. shoot the ball.

1018
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Let's try that again.
shall we?

1019
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
-

1020
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Ooh!

1021
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
-Come back here. you.
-

1022
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Whoo-hoo!

1023
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
-What the...?

1024
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
I say. I say. hi-ho. Silver!

1025
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Yee-haw!

1026
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Ow!

1027
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Ball hogs.
-

1028
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Hey! I'm open!

1029
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Go. Tunes!

1030
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Here I go.

1031
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
-Taz. no!

1032
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Whoa!

1033
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Ay! Diablo loco!

1034
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Let me show you how it's done.
Three-point land!

1035
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Where'd she get the ramp?

1036
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
In your face!

1037
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
This isn't real basketball.

1038
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
You're right. But it's fun!

1039
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
You remember fun.
don't you. Doc?

1040
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Game. Blouses! What?

1041
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
You lost LeBron James?

1042
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And his son? For real?

1043
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.

1044
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
I didn't lose LeBron.

1045
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
-so stop saying that!
-

1046
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Oh. come on. man.

1047
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Listen. his wife keeps calling
me every ten minutes.

1048
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Now. I gotta get back
to her soon

1049
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
or she gonna kill me. man.

1050
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Look. does my name badge say.
"LeBron Finder"?

1051
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
"LeBron Locator"?
No. it doesn't.

1052
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
But isn't it your job
to secure something?

1053
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
With all due respect.

1054
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
I went to school
for six months

1055
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
to be accredited
as a security specialist.

1056
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
specializing
in the securial arts.

1057
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And the sooner
you come to terms

1058
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete.

1059
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.

1060
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
I'm a professional!
An avid professional. man!

1061
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
-I ain't lose LeBron.

1062
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
and I ain't ask you
about your...

1063
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Hey. Kamiyah.

1064
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Yeah. I got the funniest story
to tell you.

1065
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Oh. snap!
I gotta call you back.

1066
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I'm driving through a canyon
right now.

1067
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
He ain't in no canyon.

1068
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
He in my office.
violating my personal space!

1069
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
I'm driving through a canyon
right here!

1070
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
He need to get back on his
business and find LeBron.

1071
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
-Code ten! Code ten!
-

1072
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
-You... I can't hear...
-Malik.

1073
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
You have zero seconds
to tell me

1074
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
where my husband
and my son are.

1075
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Okay. young prince.

1076
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
time to rebuild
your character.

1077
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Al. have you
done this before?

1078
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1079
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I upgrade things all the time.

1080
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
I mean. look at Pete.
for instance.

1081
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
He was hideous. now he's
adorable. Right. Pete?

1082
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
-Ugh. Don't...

1083
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Don't look at Pete. okay?
Just focus on yourself.

1084
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
That's the character
customization menu

1085
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
from my game.

1086
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Yes. it is. Now. with this.

1087
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
you can become the player

1088
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
that your dad
always wanted you to be.

1089
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Best part is.
you get to do it your way.

1090
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
You have control.

1091
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Seventy-five?
You're good with 75?

1092
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Come on! We didn't come here
to be three-quarters.

1093
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Pete's a 75.
he can't even rebound.

1094
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Come on. Dom. Let's go.

1095
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Dream big. son. Turn up.

1096
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Turn up.

1097
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
That's it. Now you're living.

1098
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Let's go! Yes!

1099
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Ha-ha! Yes.

1100
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Now. you are finally gonna be
who you really are.

1101
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Captain of my basketball team.

1102
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Whoa. wait a minute.
Take it. Swish!

1103
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
-Watch me do it.

1104
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Come on. Pete.
Running man on 'em. Whoo!

1105
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Wait. wait. wait...
-Running man on 'em. Huh?

1106
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000
You said we were rebuilding
my character.

1107
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
You never said anything

1108
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
about me
actually playing in the game.

1109
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Look. do you want your dad
to respect you or not?

1110
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
-Yeah. but...
-No. Dom. No buts.

1111
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
You want
your dad to respect you.

1112
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
you beat him in a game
of your own creation.

1113
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Dads don't understand
reason. Dom.

1114
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
They understand power.

1115
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
You take the power.

1116
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
You gotta make him
respect you.

1117
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
You make him see
that you are special.

1118
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Do it. Upgrade me.

1119
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Yeah! Feel it!

1120
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Yeah!

1121
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Yeah!

1122
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Yo! I got handles!

1123
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
You got mad handles.

1124
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
There's no way
we're gonna get beat now.

1125
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Hey. how about we show
your teammates some love?

1126
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Have some fun with it.

1127
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
-

1128
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
And remember. Dom.

1129
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
no rules. okay?

1130
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Forget about fundamentals.

1131
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Okay. I think I can make
a few customizations.

1132
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Ooh.

1133
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
I'm sure you can.

1134
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
And now Bron
won't answer my calls

1135
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
or texts or anything.

1136
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
It's almost like...

1137
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
It's almost like they were
abducted. all right?

1138
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
What?

1139
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Now. we gotta rule out
all possibilities here.

1140
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Now. I'm talking about aliens.
okay? The government.

1141
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
-Uh. the New York Knicks.
-

1142
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
-Guys. guys. Dad just tweeted.

1143
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
-Thank God! About what?
-Okay.

1144
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Said he's playing
in a game later today.

1145
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Is that Dom?
Yeah. Some kinda...

1146
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Game?

1147
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
...epic live event that
you can stream on this app.

1148
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Weird.

1149
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
I just had
a thought. okay?

1150
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Now. if he's tweeting
from his phone right now.

1151
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
then that means you can...

1152
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
I can track him on my phone.

1153
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
That's what I was gonna say.

1154
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Pre-game ritual?

1155
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000
I like to remind myself who
I'm playing for. My family.

1156
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
And right now.
it's all about Dom.

1157
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
We'll get your son back.
I promise.

1158
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Ooh! My ship!
Finally I shall get my...

1159
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Wow! Isn't this great?
We're all back together.

1160
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Come on. Tunes.
We gotta get to work.

1161
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Move it or lose it. rabbit.

1162
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Jeez. can't a guy stop
and smell the roses?

1163
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
A little help here?

1164
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Uh. well... Oh. I...

1165
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Okay. one more time.

1166
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
In and out. crossover.
step back. shoot.

1167
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Ooh. that's some fancy
footwork. Doc. Let me try.

1168
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Okay. Stop!

1169
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Can't touch this!

1170
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
-What the...? Really?

1171
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Look. Bugs. you already got
what you wanted.

1172
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Your friends. Tune World.

1173
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
I still need my son back.

1174
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Outside these lines.
be as looney as you want.

1175
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
But inside. you do what I say.

1176
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Oh. I see.

1177
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
You're that kind of king.

1178
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Look. Bugs.
it's my way or the highway.

1179
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Uh... Guys?

1180
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Oh. yeah?
Yeah.

1181
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Fundamentals
win championships.

1182
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Uh-oh.

1183
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
He's here.

1184
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Go! Go! Get out of the way!

1185
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
-

1186
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
I say.
shake a leg. Granny!

1187
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Watch out!

1188
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
I got you.  pajarito!

1189
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Huh?

1190
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Well. if it isn't
the old-news Looney Tunes.

1191
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Looking just as washed up
as ever.

1192
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
You know what?

1193
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
I think it's time
for an upgrade.

1194
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
An upgrade?

1195
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
-No!

1196
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Whoa. Whoa. whoa.

1197
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Lola!

1198
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
What in the world?

1199
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
I say. I say.

1200
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
cock-a-doodle-doo...
not do that.

1201
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
I look expensive!

1202
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
What's happening?

1203
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Oh. no!

1204
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Oh. they're alive! Alive!

1205
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Oh. yeah. You're looking
sharp. Looney Tunes.

1206
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Al G..

1207
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
this means war.

1208
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Whatever. Bugs.

1209
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Where's my son?

1210
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Oh. now you wanna be
Daddy of the Year?

1211
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Just calm down. LeBron.
He'll be here. okay?

1212
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
We got bigger fish to fry.

1213
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Let's get some butts
in these seats!

1214
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
How big are these butts?

1215
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yabba Dabba Doo!

1216
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Hey. Boo-Boo!

1217
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
-

1218
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Hey. yo.
he's probably in here.

1219
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Don't be scared. Come on.

1220
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Welcome. James family.

1221
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
No. Xosha. Wait.

1222
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Ladies first.

1223
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
-Really?
-No?

1224
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
All right. I'mma go first
'cause I'm a gentleman.

1225
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Uh-huh.

1226
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Bron?

1227
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It says he's in here.

1228
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Dad?

1229
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Dom?

1230
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Bron?

1231
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Where's the other half
of the crowd?

1232
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Uh. they should be tuning in

1233
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
to the livestream
right about...

1234
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Right about...

1235
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Right about...

1236
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Buffering!
So embarrassing.

1237
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Right about now!

1238
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Oh. yeah.

1239
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Oh. that's it.

1240
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It's game time!

1241
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yo.

1242
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It's game time!

1243
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Hey. look here.

1244
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It's game time!

1245
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I say. I say. how in the world

1246
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
did he get
all these spectators here?

1247
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I don't know. but the line

1248
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
for the bathroom's
gonna be insane.

1249
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And we're back
from commercial and...

1250
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Where are we?

1251
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Lil Rel?

1252
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Man.
what are you doing here?

1253
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Wait. Ernie Johnson?
This is crazy!

1254
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Look. I was
on my phone. right.

1255
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and I was getting
on the elevator...

1256
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Wait a minute. did I fall down
the elevator shaft?

1257
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Ernie. are we dead?

1258
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Is this
what heaven looks like?

1259
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
No. it looks like
we're in some kinda

1260
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
computer-generated
basketball game.

1261
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It looks like
Dad's game's starting.

1262
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
What? Let me see that.

1263
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Oh. Bron. Bron.

1264
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Who's this guy?

1265
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Got some VIPs coming in.

1266
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
No!

1267
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah!

1268
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
What a twist!

1269
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
No. we shouldn't
be watching that.

1270
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Where is he?
Where is this coming from?

1271
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Something's
not right here.

1272
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It's game time!

1273
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
What?

1274
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Whoa. what in the world?

1275
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Mommy. what just happened?

1276
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Oh. my God! Kids!

1277
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Bron!

1278
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Babe. what is going on?
Where's Dom?

1279
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I don't know. but I have to go
to play this game

1280
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
-to save everyone with...
-Bugs Bunny?

1281
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
What's up. Doc?

1282
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That's kinda normal
around here.

1283
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Dad. this is Dom's game.
You know how to play. right?

1284
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's basketball. Of course!

1285
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Yeah.

1286
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Uh. excuse me?
Paging Mr. LeBron James!

1287
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1288
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
-I promise.

1289
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Zap me into you.

1290
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Sorry.
I didn't understand that.

1291
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I said. zap me. into you.

1292
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Zap me. human.
into you. phone.

1293
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Zap me.

1294
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Ladies and gentlemen.

1295
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
please give a warm welcome
to your host for the evening.

1296
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
-Mr. Al G. Rhythm!
-

1297
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Hey. how y'all doing?

1298
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Thank you!

1299
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
-Thank you very much!
-

1300
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen.
boys and girls.

1301
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
welcome to the first and final
Serververse Classic!

1302
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Oh! Let me tell you what.

1303
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I know that you all
are LeBron's biggest fans.

1304
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And the King has had
a great run. hasn't he?

1305
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But that's over.
That's done now.

1306
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And it is time for a new king
to take the throne.

1307
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
This dude is a hater.

1308
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Haters gonna hate.

1309
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
-He's a bad guy.
- Big time.

1310
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So let's lay down
some basic ground rules.

1311
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If King James wins.

1312
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you all get to go back
to your regular. boring lives.

1313
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
But if my team wins.

1314
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
you all get to stay with me
in the Serververse

1315
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
-forever.
-

1316
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
What?

1317
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
How 'bout that. huh?

1318
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
What? That wasn't the deal.

1319
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Oh. yeah! Didn't see
that coming. did you?

1320
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Well. at least we're good.

1321
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Oh. boy.

1322
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Oh. and I almost forgot.
all of the Tunes

1323
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
will be deleted. so...

1324
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Oh. no!

1325
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Deleted?
- That is messed up!

1326
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That dude is bad.
- Why?

1327
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
You just couldn't keep
your big beak shut.

1328
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
-Blabbermouth.

1329
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I deserved that.

1330
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And now. from the beautiful
mind of Dominic James...

1331
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Introducing...

1332
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the Goon Squad!

1333
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Whoo!

1334
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
White Mamba!

1335
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
What's up?

1336
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Wet ball. baby!

1337
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Wet Fire!

1338
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Arachnneka!

1339
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Queen of the web. Mwah.

1340
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
-

1341
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And The Brow.

1342
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Flyest guy on the squad.

1343
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Dang!

1344
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
What'd they do to my boy. AD?

1345
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And this next young

1346
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
man I'm bringing up...

1347
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh. my goodness.
Y'all gonna love him.

1348
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
He puts the G in genius.

1349
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
He's my hero
on the ones and zeroes.

1350
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Mr. Dominic James!

1351
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Dom!

1352
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
[hip-hop music
continues playing]

1353
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Give it up one more
time for Dominic James!

1354
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Dom!

1355
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Dom!

1356
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I don't think he can hear you.

1357
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I'm his mother.
He better hear me.

1358
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dom!

1359
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
-Whoa.
-Right? It's amazing.

1360
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
All these people came here
to see you. Dom.

1361
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And we used your scanning tech
to make it happen.

1362
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Check 'em out.

1363
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
This is dope.

1364
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
-Dom.
- Dad!

1365
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Are you okay. son?

1366
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I've never been better.

1367
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Listen to me.
Everyone in here is in danger.

1368
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Come on. Dad.

1369
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Why you gotta make everything
so serious?

1370
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This is serious.
Your boy Al G..

1371
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
-he's a bad dude.
-What?

1372
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.

1373
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard

1374
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
and no one pays
attention to him.

1375
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
He's like me. Dad.

1376
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
No. he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.

1377
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1378
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Why you using
all these charged words...

1379
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Deleted. Manipulate...
Kidnapped.

1380
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Come on. LeBron. chill out.

1381
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
What'd you say. man?

1382
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.

1383
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Thought you'd be happy.

1384
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yeah. you keep it up.

1385
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
you ain't gonna get
that Father's Day card.

1386
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Those things
are not guaranteed.

1387
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
-Dom.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1388
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You going down.
King James.

1389
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Hey. yo. Brow.

1390
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I think it's time
for your eyebrows

1391
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
to break up with each other.

1392
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh?

1393
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
They ugly. Let it go.

1394
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?

1395
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
We'll show him who's boss.

1396
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
What did he say. Bron?

1397
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
He thinks Al G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.

1398
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You gotta win this game...

1399
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and get our son back.

1400
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Okay.

1401
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's game time!

1402
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Pete's the referee?

1403
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Look.
I don't want to alarm you

1404
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
or any of our viewers.

1405
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
but apparently.

1406
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
if the Tune Squad
doesn't win this game.

1407
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
we're all gonna be
trapped here forever.

1408
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Luckily
the Tune Squad got

1409
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.

1410
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I ain't sweating it.

1411
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
-Oh. we doomed. We're doomed!

1412
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You gotta be kidding me.

1413
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Did you see
that kid fly?

1414
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Uh-huh.

1415
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
He's like Superman.
but with a hi-top fade.

1416
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Rel. I gotta tell you.

1417
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
this Goon Squad is loaded.
top to bottom.

1418
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Bugs Bunny is gonna need
a rabbit's foot

1419
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
against this guy. Wet Fire.

1420
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Oh! Because he's wet.
and he's fire.

1421
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
That's kinda brilliant.

1422
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
-Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
- What?

1423
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
-Gimme that ball!
-Back off. rabbit.

1424
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Entering
the Splash Zone! Ha-ha!

1425
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And you know
what else is brilliant?

1426
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
This ball movement. man.
Check it out.

1427
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Sufferin' succotash!

1428
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Leading!

1429
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
-Whoo!
-

1430
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Sixteen? What's up
with the score?

1431
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Style points. Dad.

1432
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Style points?

1433
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Style points?

1434
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We playing video game rules.

1435
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Style points. power-ups.

1436
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
See. kids. playing video games
do pay off!

1437
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Come on. baby bunny.

1438
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Out of my way. you big worm.

1439
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Thank you.

1440
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Help me. Please.

1441
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
What?

1442
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Come chase this down.

1443
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Arachnneka
throws down a monster dunk.

1444
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And she dunks again.
And again and again.

1445
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Eat that. eat that.
eat that. eat that.

1446
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And again and again and again!
And again!

1447
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
-And again!
-

1448
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Ow.

1449
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Down goes the king!

1450
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Is... Is this legal?

1451
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Man. she got six arms.
What else she supposed to do?

1452
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Oh. boy.

1453
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Get up. LeBron.
We need you.

1454
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
How'd that taste. King?

1455
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Yeah! Can't touch us.

1456
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Listen. Bron-Bron.

1457
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
This is basketball.
but with a spin to it.

1458
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
We gotta think outta the box.

1459
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
There's only one basketball.

1460
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And. Bugs.
don't do nothing looney.

1461
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Nothing looney?

1462
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Let's go!

1463
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
We're not called
the "Fundamental Tunes."

1464
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Don't just stand there.
rabbit!

1465
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Get the ball to LeBron!

1466
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
LeBron's so hard
to guard down low

1467
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
using that huge size
advantage.

1468
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Sorry. son. You know
I gotta go win this game.

1469
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
If you say so.

1470
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Ooh.
he just got blocked by Dom.

1471
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
The King has been dethroned.

1472
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
His own son.

1473
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
That is cold-blooded. Ernie.

1474
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Look. this is not like
any kind of basketball

1475
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
LeBron has ever seen.

1476
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
- Whoo!

1477
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I've never seen
anything like this.

1478
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Where's that pass going?

1479
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
-Hey. what up. Bugs?
-Watch the hair.

1480
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Thank you. Assist.

1481
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Top floor!

1482
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
- 33-pointer?

1483
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
-Oh. yes!
-Huh?

1484
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Well played.
See. this is why we practice.

1485
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
-We didn't. We don't practice.

1486
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
What's up with that. Pete?

1487
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You can't move the basket like
that. man. that's cheating.

1488
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
No. you can.
You can move the basket.

1489
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Man. you don't
even know what you're talk...

1490
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
-A technical?

1491
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Oh. you're gonna give me
a technical?

1492
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
-Man. I wish you would. Tsk!
-

1493
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I say. what kind of ship
are you running here?

1494
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
You gotta call the game fair.

1495
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
-Well. that happened.
-

1496
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Never in my career

1497
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
did I think
I'd say these five words.

1498
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
"Foghorn Leghorn
just got ejected."

1499
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
This is not going well.

1500
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Your dad's got this. I hope.

1501
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Let's go. Stand her up.
D up! Right there.

1502
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Come here. bunny.

1503
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
- Iverson'd! Ha-ha!

1504
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
-

1505
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Way to go!
We love LeBron!

1506
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
-Let's go!

1507
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
You act like
it's the first time

1508
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
-

1509
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Buckets.

1510
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
-

1511
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Buckets.

1512
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Who you calling "worm"?

1513
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Not you. girl.

1514
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Ooh! I got her. I got her!

1515
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Oh. she got me.

1516
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
We're gettin' murderized!

1517
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Try a power-up. Dad!

1518
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
What you got. King?

1519
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Gimme that. gimme that.
gimme that!

1520
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
-Oh. I got this.
-Wait!

1521
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
LeBron's on a mission.
He wants to go coast to coast!

1522
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And...

1523
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
then some.

1524
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
- Ouch.

1525
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
-Ooh.
-

1526
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Yikes.

1527
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
LeBron just hit a force field.

1528
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Man.
and speaking from experience.

1529
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
that's gonna leave a mark.

1530
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
We gotta stop meeting
this way.

1531
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Tell me about it.

1532
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Time out.

1533
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I'm not a betting duck.

1534
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
but. uh. my money's
on the other team.

1535
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Let's run a triangle offense.

1536
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
-We're getting crushed.
- A square offense.

1537
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
A trapezoid offense?
Any shape!

1538
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I know.

1539
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Look at 'em.
Their spirit is broken.

1540
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and that's exactly
what we want.

1541
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But I guess it's time to
put 'em out of their misery.

1542
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Go ahead and take
a little break. Dom Dom.

1543
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
because do you know
what time it is?

1544
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
What time is it. Al?

1545
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Oh. it's Dame Time.

1546
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
New character unlocked.

1547
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
New character?

1548
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Here's our first

1549
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Goon Squad substitution
of the night.

1550
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Chronos!

1551
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
It's the King Stomper!

1552
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
-

1553
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
-Granny. I'm subbing you out.
-What?

1554
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
-Road Runner. you're in.
-Beep. beep.

1555
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Knock yourself out. kid.

1556
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Chronos!
Oh. yeah! Whoo!

1557
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Chronos!

1558
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Beep. beep.

1559
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Ready. set. go

1560
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I'm saying whoa

1561
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And it's about that time

1562
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Beep. beep.

1563
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Sheesh!

1564
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Dude could use a makeover.

1565
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Mmm. Oh.

1566
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Wow. Whoo!

1567
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Hmm. Oh. Okay.

1568
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Ha-ha! Word.

1569
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Oh...

1570
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
[upbeat hip-hop
music continues]

1571
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
-

1572
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah!

1573
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Dame Time!
-Bye. bye!

1574
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Ooh. I'm feeling salty now.

1575
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
-Way to Dominate!
-

1576
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
That's how you do it. Dom!

1577
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Goon Squad. what?

1578
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Yeah. Dom!
Puttin' the lights out!

1579
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Yeah. Dom!

1580
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
-Hey. Tune lover.
-Wow.

1581
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
You feel good?
Feel great.

1582
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
What a job. What a job!
Amazing. He's amazing.

1583
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Goon Squad. what you got?

1584
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
They can't touch us.

1585
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Goon Squad!

1586
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
We got this.

1587
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You're the best. Dom.
You're the best!

1588
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Come on. give it up!
Give it up!

1589
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Thanks for the turnovers.

1590
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Goon Squad!

1591
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Goon Squad!

1592
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Oh. please don't let us
get deleted.

1593
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Please don't let us
get deleted.

1594
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Come on. guys.
Don't give up.

1595
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
There's a whole other half
to play.

1596
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I'm telling you.
we can still win this.

1597
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
How? We're getting decimated.

1598
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
We need a boost. A pick-me-up.

1599
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
A secret weapon.

1600
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
We need a miracle.

1601
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I don't know
if this counts as a miracle.

1602
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
but I found Michael Jordan!

1603
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
He was in the audience.
I know he can help.

1604
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
His Airness?

1605
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You found him?

1606
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I can feel his power already.

1607
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Ooh. I can hear his shoes.

1608
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
At guard. 6'6".
from North Carolina...

1609
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Number 23.

1610
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Michael Jordan...

1611
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
-Huh?
-

1612
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Come on. man.
That's Michael B. Jordan.

1613
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The actor.

1614
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I was just getting
some popcorn.

1615
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
and then this cat grabbed me.

1616
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
We couldn't get
Michael A. Jordan.

1617
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
so we got Michael B. Jordan?

1618
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
How could you think
he was His Airness?

1619
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
They look nothing alike.

1620
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's been 25 years.
I thought he aged gracefully.

1621
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
This is awkward. um.

1622
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
but I believe in you guys.
okay?

1623
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Clear eyes. full hearts.
can't lose. You hear me?

1624
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Clear eyes. full hearts.
can't lose!

1625
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
-Say it with me--
- Mike.

1626
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Yeah. y'all got this.

1627
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm... I'm too much.
You're right. I'm sorry.

1628
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I'mma go back to my seat.
You came back three-one.

1629
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
-Well...
- You killed it.

1630
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
You can do it again!

1631
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Right.

1632
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Well. that was a bust.

1633
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Anyone else
got any bright ideas?

1634
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Come on!
Get it together. guys.

1635
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up at halftime.

1636
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up ever.

1637
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
We're down a thousand points.

1638
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
No team is coming back
from this.

1639
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Well. why don't you try
coaching us better. bucko!

1640
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I've been coaching y'all
this whole time!

1641
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Sylvester over here
getting the wrong MJ.

1642
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Granny's out here
having a martini at halftime.

1643
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
and Taz might as well
be playing for the other team!

1644
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Your son
plays for the other team.

1645
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Yeah. you're a bad dad.

1646
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I'm a bad dad?

1647
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I've been trying
to save my son

1648
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
and coach y'all
at the same time.

1649
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
-What y'all doing?
-We've been trying.

1650
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Trying to do what?

1651
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Trying to be like you.

1652
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And it's not working.

1653
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Because you're not me.

1654
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
"You never let me just...
do me."

1655
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Huh?

1656
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Okay. I got it. New game plan.

1657
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Bugs.

1658
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Time to do
what you guys do best.

1659
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
You know something?

1660
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
If we're going out.
we're going out looney.

1661
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Let's go. team!

1662
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
All tooney. big mooney.
full looney!

1663
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Good plan.
I say. good plan.

1664
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
It seems bleak.
but let's remember.

1665
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
there's an entire half
left to play.

1666
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
-

1667
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Oh. that first half
was interminable.

1668
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Are you kidding me?

1669
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
-It's showtime!

1670
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
-[all cheering]
-[hip-hop music continues]

1671
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Yeah! Let's go. Tunes!

1672
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yep. we in here.
Are we ready?

1673
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Tune Squad.
we in the building!

1674
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Ha-ha. Yes. sir!

1675
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
- Tune Squad!

1676
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
-

1677
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Hey. they may be down
a gazillion points.

1678
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
but LeBron James and the Tunes
are coming back out here

1679
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
for the third quarter
with some renewed energy.

1680
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And I don't understand why.
They are losing really badly.

1681
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
All right. here we go
in the third quarter.

1682
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Uh-oh.

1683
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah! Bird versus baby bird.

1684
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Do you have your ticket?

1685
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
'Cause the 11:50 Express
is running on time.

1686
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
-Hmm? Huh?

1687
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Classic.

1688
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Give me that ball. rabbit.

1689
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Whoa!

1690
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
-

1691
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Someone's absorbed
in the game.

1692
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Beep. beep.
-

1693
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yo.
-Hey. guys.

1694
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Where's the ball?

1695
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Beep. beep.

1696
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
-Beep. beep.

1697
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Oh. no! Are you kidding me?

1698
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Road Runner smokescreen?

1699
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It's the oldest trick
in the book!

1700
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Tweety!

1701
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Ooh. slam dunk!

1702
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
-Just like I drew it up.

1703
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Gossamer. I say.
he's the quicker-picker-upper.

1704
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Oh. what
a no-look pass ahead to Dom.

1705
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Looks like the Goons
are playing keep-away.

1706
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Dom passes to Wet Fire.

1707
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Wet Fire back to Brow.
He's gonna dunk... Oh!

1708
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
-But he freezes at the rim!
-

1709
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Oh? Huh?

1710
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
What are you doing?

1711
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Giving new meaning to
"suspended from the game"!

1712
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Give me that.

1713
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
But the Goons fast break.
take it to the other end.

1714
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
These silly Tunes don't have
what it takes to win.

1715
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
No. wait. wait.
I wasn't trying to start a...

1716
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Oh. we rappin' now?
We rappin'?

1717

Hey. Porky. fry 'em.

1718
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Fry 'em? Me... Me... Me?

what we just witnessed here.

He just got
bonus points for those bars.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Everyone really getting behind
the Tune Squad.

1771
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You know somethin'.
it's about time.

1772
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Coming off
the bench now for the Tunes.

1773
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Wile E. Coyote.

1774
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Beep. beep.

1775
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Wow.

1776
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Look out.

1777
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Looks like Wile E.'s
gotten himself

1778
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
mixed up in the machine.

1779
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And just like that.

1780
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
the Tunes have a thousand
points on the board.

1781
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
We havin' fun yet?

1782
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
They're gonna clean
these coyotes off the court

1783
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
-and keep the game going.
-

1784
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
What's wrong. Al?
That was awesome.

1785
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
What do you mean.
"What's wrong?"

1786
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
They're catching up.

1787
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Run Dame Time.

1788
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Not him again.

1789
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
He's gonna
make bacon out of us.

1790
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Oh. don't worry.
Time's on our side.

1791
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
She knows time is literally
on their side. right?

1792
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
You sure about this. Granny?

1793
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm going old-school
on his butt.

1794
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
-Whoa.
-

1795
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Come on.

1796
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
-Stop!

1797
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
-Tick-tock.

1798
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
-Hyah!

1799
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
-She is The One.

1800
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
What in the AARP
is going on out here?

1801
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I got hops! Whoo!

1802
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Lola!

1803
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Got you. Bron!

1804
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
-There we go! Let's go!

1805
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And the Tunes
take the lead!

1806
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
What a play from Lola
and LeBron James!

1807
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
-A monster jam!
-

1808
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
LeBron came back
from three-one down.

1809
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Can he come back
from this far back?

1810
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Let me tell you this.
I woke up today

1811
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and only knew one world.

1812
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Then I got sucked into
my phone. and at this point.

1813
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
anything's possible!

1814
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
-

1815
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
-Way to go. Tunes!
-Let's go!

1816
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Foghorn. right here.

1817
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
-Yeah!
- Yeah!

1818
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
-I say. that's all right!
- Lola!

1819
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Yes! My dude!

1820
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Taz!

1821
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
-Go. baby! Yeah!
-Oh. yeah! Here we go!

1822
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Way to go.
Tune Squad!

1823
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1824
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Now we having some fun! Yeah!

1825
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Whoo-hoo! This is
fun basketball right here!

1826
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
-Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
- All right!

1827
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Hey. Dom. are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?

1828
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?

1829
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Make up your mind.
Make up your mind.

1830
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Let's go. Sit down.

1831
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Yeah. Way to get looney
out there.

1832
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
-Ooh-whee!

1833
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
We did it!

1834
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Everybody happy. huh?

1835
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Everybody having
a good time? Yeah?

1836
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
You having a lot of fun
out there?

1837
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
'Cause that's all
that matters. right?

1838
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Is that you're having fun.

1839
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
That doesn't matter at all!

1840
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
What matters is that
I win this  game!

1841
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Oh. and you. Dom.

1842
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
How are you losing
at your own game?

1843
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
For server's sake.

1844
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I didn't even think
that was possible!

1845
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I expected a lot more
out of you. son.

1846
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!

1847
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
All right!

1848
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!

1849
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Drinks on me!

1850
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Boy. that was awesome!

1851
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Go team!

1852
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Yeah. maybe
your dad was right about you.

1853
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Letting you be you
was a mistake.

1854
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
-Okay.

1855
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
If everybody would move down.

1856
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
then we could all sit
on the bench.

1857
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Let's all sit on the bench!

1858
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Now that's what
I call momentum. son.

1859
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
LeBron?
- Way to go!

1860
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Hey. you with us?

1861
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I'm so tickled.

1862
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Let's end this.

1863
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I'm getting my son back.

1864
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I wonder what move
he's gonna do.

1865
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
The post-up?

1866
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Maybe the fadeaway.

1867
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
He's gonna dunk all over him.

1868
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Look at that kid!
Kid's too small.

1869
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Dad. what are you doing?

1870
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
We're in the middle of a game.

1871
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Hey. what's goin' on?

1872
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I don't know.

1873
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Dad...

1874
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Dom. your game
is amazing. son.

1875
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But I guess
I would've known that

1876
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
if I would've listened more.

1877
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Sorry I didn't.

1878
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
For me. when I was a kid.

1879
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
the things that I went through
to get where I am now.

1880
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I had to be a certain way.

1881
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Yeah. it helped me win games.

1882
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
but not so much being a dad.

1883
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.

1884
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I want you to be yourself.

1885
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Do you understand
how much I love you?

1886
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Do you understand
how important you are to me?

1887
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
How very special you are?

1888
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I mean. I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

1889
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Sounds right to me.

1890
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I love you. Dad.

1891
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I love you too. son.

1892
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
-Oh. now. that's beautiful.
- Let's go!

1893
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Whoo!

1894
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I think I'm gonna cry.

1895
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Not me.

1896
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Bugs. pull it together.

1897
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Dom!

1898
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Dom!

1899
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Mom!

1900
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Hey. Xosha!

1901
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Are you serious?

1902
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Zip it!

1903
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
You two are a joke.
you know that?

1904
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I got this. Dad.

1905
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Oh. what?
You got something to say?

1906
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Yeah.

1907
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I think you want people to
fear you more than anything.

1908
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And I'm not about that. Al G.

1909
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I'm playing with my dad.

1910
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
First of all. it's Mr. Rhythm
to you. you little traitor.

1911
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Second of all. you're not.

1912
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
You're playing
against your dad.

1913
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
See what this says?
"Goon Squad."

1914
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
You already
made your choice. Dom.

1915
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Right. Pete? He can't...

1916
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
-Pete. are you crying?

1917
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
There's no crying
in the Serververse. Pete!

1918
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
All right. Yeah. all right.

1919
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I see how it is. Dom.

1920
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I see how it is.

1921
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I gave you everything!

1922
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I say. I say.
good to have you. son.

1923
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Great spot for you
right here. kid.

1924
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
We got 'em now!

1925
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Bienvenido. senorito!

1926
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Somebody get him a new jersey.

1927
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Welcome to the hunt.

1928
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Sufferin' succotash!

1929
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I made this. just in case.

1930
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Thanks. Granny.

1931
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Eh. What's up. Dom?

1932
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Oh. it's so nice to meet you.

1933
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Here you go. Dom.

1934
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Really glad
to have you on the team!

1935
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Thanks. Dad.

1936
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Fine.

1937
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You wanna join these losers?

1938
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You go ahead. Dom.

1939
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
'Cause it's not your game
anymore.

1940
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I am the game.

1941
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
King Kong
ain't got nothin' on me!

1942
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
-Did you see that?
-Uh-huh.

1943
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
The man just grew.
like. five feet.

1944
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Yo. King.

1945
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
You're about to lose
your family. your friends.

1946
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
those Tunes.

1947
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
everything you love.

1948
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I don't think so.

1949
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Oh. it's on.

1950
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Count it!

1951
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah. Lola!

1952
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
All right!

1953
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Nice pass. King!

1954
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Let's go. Tunes!

1955
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Let's go. Tunes!

1956
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Let's go. Tunes!

1957
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
That's cute.
But I thought I told you...

1958
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
What?

1959
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Ugh!

1960
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
...it's my game now.

1961
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yo. yo. switching everything.

1962
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Yo'. stay home. Bump out.

1963
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Sic 'em. Goons.

1964
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Get back. rabbit.

1965
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Ow!

1966
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
-Come here!
-

1967
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Incoming!

1968
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
-

1969
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Whoo!

1970
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I'm a monster!

1971
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
We about to break
the internet. baby!

1972
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It's over.

1973
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Time out.

1974
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
-Oh. brother.
-

1975
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Did you see that?

1976
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
He's cheating!

1977
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Well. I say. I say.
that plain ol' sucks.

1978
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Listen. it's all right.

1979
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
All we gotta do
is get one bucket.

1980
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
How can we score
if he controls the game. Doc?

1981
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Whoa!
Where my Goons at?

1982
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Right here. Coach!

1983
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
No mercy!

1984
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
That no-good.
despicable son of a glitch!

1985
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Yo! That's it!

1986
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Your move. Dad. Remember?

1987
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
The step-back glitch.

1988
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
In and out. crossover.
step back. shoot.

1989
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
That move froze my whole game.

1990
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And that's good because...

1991
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
If the game crashes.

1992
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Al G. won't be able
to control it anymore.

1993
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And if he can't control it.

1994
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
he can't stop us
from scoring.

1995
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Right!

1996
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Oh. boy!
- Yeah! Yay!

1997
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Wait.

1998
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
-That's not gonna work.
- Why not?

1999
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
When my character did
the step-back. it got deleted.

2000
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
So. whoever does
the glitch move...

2001
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
-Will get deleted.
-

2002
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So. I say. so I guess
we're drawing straws.

2003
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
We are not doing that.

2004
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
We'll think of something else.

2005
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
What about the old alley-oop?

2006
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I'm gonna do the step-back.

2007
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
What? No.
Dad. you'll be deleted.

2008
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I'm not
a video game character.

2009
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I think I'll be okay.

2010
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Dad. you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.

2011
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Dom.

2012
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Somebody's gotta do something.

2013
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
LeBron.
you don't have to do this.

2014
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
No!

2015
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Listen. just get me the ball.

2016
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Hands in.

2017
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Tune Squad on three.

2018
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
One. two. three...

2019
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Tune Squad!

2020
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
-

2021
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Here we go.

2022
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Yeah. this is fun. huh?

2023
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
We should just do it again.
and again. and again.

2024
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Just over. and over. and over
for all eternity.

2025
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
How's that sound?

2026
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Ten seconds
on the clock.

2027
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
-The Tunes are one style point

2028
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
or defeat.

2029
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
This is
their last chance.

2030
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Bugs. what are you doing?

2031
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And it looks like
a broken play!

2032
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
In and out. crossover.
step back...

2033
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Bugs. no!

2034
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Shoot!

2035
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Bugs' shot
is gonna be short.

2036
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
But wait. LeBron is flying
through the air!

2037
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Come on. Dad.

2038
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Oh. no.

2039
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
He's not gonna make it.

2040
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
He's... He's not...

2041
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Gonna make it.

2042
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
No.

2043
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
That's cheating!

2044
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Great. Posterized.

2045
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
-Yeah! Yes! Let's go!

2046
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Whoo!

2047
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
We did it! Yeah!

2048
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
-Posterized. Yeah!
-Beep. beep.

2049
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
The Tunes win!
The Tunes win!

2050
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
-Unbelievable!
-

2051
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Al G. just got turned
into a literal poster.

2052
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
This is not
how I wanted to go out!

2053
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
-Yeah!
-I say. I say.

2054
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
-that's all right!
-That's what I'm talkin' about!

2055
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
No. no. no. no. no!

2056
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Hold on. No! No!

2057
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Adios.  Goons!

2058
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
We won! Whoo-hoo! We won!

2059
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Give me a hug!

2060
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
-Somebody hug me! Anybody?
-I love y'all. Yeah. Tunes!

2061
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
-All right. Dad!
-Beep. beep.

2062
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Great assist. Dom!

2063
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Whoa!

2064
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yes! I never doubted you
for a second. LeBron!

2065
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
We are going home!
Thank you so much!

2066
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
You are the Akron Hammer.
The chosen one!

2067
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
King James. man! I love you!

2068
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
We going home.

2069
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Bugs...

2070
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
-How'd I do. Coach?
-

2071
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Bugs. that's the least looney
thing you've ever done.

2072
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
You got that right.

2073
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
But taking care of the people
you love is fundamental.

2074
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Right. Doc?

2075
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Thank you.

2076
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Goodbye. Bron.

2077
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
We did it.

2078
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
We're all back together again.

2079
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Bugs.

2080
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
That's all. folks.

2081
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Son?
-Dad.

2082
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
-You're all right. right?
-I'm good.

2083
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
-You're sure?
-I'm good.

2084
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
All right. let's go home.

2085
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Come here. boy.

2086
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Daddy!

2087
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
-Baby. hi. Xosha. hey!
-Daddy!

2088
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
-Baby!
- Mom!

2089
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Missed y'all so much.
- Bro.

2090
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I'm so proud of you!

2091
01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
All my family.

2092
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
My goodness.

2093
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
-I love you. guys.
- We love you. too.

2094
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Come on. Malik.
Come on in. man.

2095
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You the Bron. man!

2096
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
It's a family affair. man.
Come on in.

2097
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
LeBron! LeBron.

2098
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Hey. Malik. you good?

2099
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
No. No. man.

2100
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
You cryin'?
- What?

2101
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
All right.

2102
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I ain't crying. bruh.
- Okay.

2103
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So. Dom.
you ready for basketball camp?

2104
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Yeah.
I'm actually pretty excited.

2105
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Yeah? Because I know
how much you really wanted...

2106
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I think
I'mma just take a break

2107
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
from video games for now.

2108
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
You know. after we...

2109
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Got sucked into one?

2110
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Yeah.

2111
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Really? Because. like...

2112
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I mean. I feel like
I've made a mistake.

2113
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I mean. we can turn around
right now if you want to.

2114
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
What are you talking about?

2115
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Look.

2116
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I mean. I figured it's
about time for you to do you.

2117
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
-Thank you. Dad.

2118
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
You're welcome.

2119
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Hey. man. have fun.

2120
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Yo. Dom.

2121
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Ball?

2122
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I think I'mma hold onto it.

2123
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Aw. that's so sweet.

2124
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
What's up. Doc?

2125
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
-Bugs! How did you...?
-Come on.

2126
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
You didn't think you'd get rid
of me that easily. did you?

2127
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I told ya. I'm a Tune. Doc!

2128
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I can survive anything!

2129
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
It's good to see you. buddy.

2130
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Oh. by the way.
you think I could

2131
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
crash at your pad
for a few days?

2132
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Of course. There's more
than enough room for you.

2133
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Great! I've never been
to Tinseltown.

2134
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I wanna go on a star tour.

2135
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I hear they love
drinking juice here.

2136
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Oh. do they make carrot juice?

2137
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
They juice anything
for you here.

2138
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Oh. hey. can I stay
for Taco Tuesday?

2139
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Taco Tuesday!
No doubt.

2140
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Hope you and Mrs. LeBron
got bunk beds

2141
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
'cause I got some friends
who wanna visit.

2142
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Hold up. hold up.
Bunk beds?

2143
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
That's right. I brought
the whole gang with me!

2144
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
What do you mean.
"the whole gang"?

2145
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
You can't get rid
of us now. Doc.

2146
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
We're family!

2147
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
-

2148
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
-

2149
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
-

2150
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
-

2151
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
-

2152
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
-

2153
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
See. we win

2154
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
We can do it together

2155
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Breakin' my word

2156
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Fly like a bird

2157
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I felt I was cursed

2158
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It could have been worse

2159
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I broke the reverse

2160
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
No need to rehearse

2161
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I was in need of work

2162
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
"I need this to work"

2163
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Like I needed it first

2164
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
A lot of people

2165
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And stepped away

2166
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
When I get ready

2167
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Into pieces

2168
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
-

2169
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
-

2170
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
All the champions
Out there

2171
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
-

2172
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Eh. I said
It feels so good

2173
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
-

2174
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
We will. we will
We will. we will. we will

2175
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
We will. we will
We will. we will. we will

Keepin' my patience

2178
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
To no early grave

2179
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
At any given time

2180
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
All in they faces

2181
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
The finish line

2182
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So many times

2183
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
They give me mine

2184
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Together we really shine

2185
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
My faith and trust in God

2186
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Everything'll be fine

2187
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Real stand-up guy

2188
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Breakin' my kind

2189
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Ain't never
Changin' my mind

2190
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Take it one day at a time

2191
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Take it one day at a time

2192
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I'm not good enough

2193
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And the world is falling
Down on me

2194
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Is surrounding me

2195
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000
-

2196
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Never let it break

2197
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
-

2198
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
-

2199
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000

2200
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
See. we win

2201
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Even control myself

2202
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Was meant for me

2203
01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Like someone else

2204
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
All these twists and turns

2205
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Really need your help

2206
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I cannot control the world

2207
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Even control myself

2208
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Not a star in the sky

2209
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
In the ceiling

2210
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Take a look in my eyes

2211
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
The way that I'm feelin'"

2212
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Who I think you are

2213
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Your hands to me

2214
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
To make up my mind and leave

2215
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Control the world

2216
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Even control myself

2217
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Was meant for me

2218
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000

Even control myself

2223
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
But not sure

2224
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Like the only one

2225
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Don't want myself

2226
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Be the only one

2227
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Be in my own zone

2228
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I've been tryin' to keep

2229
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
But you can keep me

2230
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
-

2231
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Control the world

2232
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Even control myself

2233
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Was meant for me

2234
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Like someone else

Really need your help

2237
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I cannot control the world

2238
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
When I can't
Even control myself

2239
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000
But for you. I try

2240
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Right out of the sky. yeah

2241
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
When you feel like
You've had enough

2242
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Give you word
That I'd back it up

2243
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
But with me
You're never out of love

2244
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
We run out of time

2245
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
"That's my guy"

2246
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Might get broken maybe

2247
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You can rely on. yeah

2248
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Are gonna let you down

2249
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And hold your head high

2250
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000
When you feel like
You've had enough

2251
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Give you word
That I'd back it up

2252
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
But with me
You're never out of love

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
We run out of time

2254

"That's my guy"

2255
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
You've had enough

2256
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
That I'd back it up

2257
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
You're never out of love

2258
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
We run out of time
