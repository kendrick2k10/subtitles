3
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.240
But perhaps we'd better begin
at the best place for stories:

4
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.320
at the beginning.

5
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.520
'Five!'

6
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240
He was responsible
for aliens attacking the world.

7
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560
'Four!'

8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.640
He blew the moon
out of the Earth's orbit.

9
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.320
'Three!'

10
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.760
And he turned a bunch of puppets
into superstars.

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.360
'Two!'

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.640
He was a wonderful chap.

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.400
One of the most honest chaps
I've ever met in my whole life.

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.560
'One!'

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.960
He's a very evil...
a very evil man.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.440
Ladies and gentlemen.
please welcome Gerry Anderson.

17
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.480
APPLAUSE

18
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.040
One has to bear in mind

19
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.560
that I was always intensely
interested in space travel.

20
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.960
I mean. I've always...

21
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.240
..looked at the starry sky
and just wondered.

22
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.200
what is out there?

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.920
I remember. in fact. my brother.

24
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.720
who was a Mosquito pilot
during the war.

25
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.040
and I couldn't have been very old.
but he came back on leave once.

26
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.560
and I remember very specifically
that he said to me once.

27
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.280
"Assuming it were possible
to fly in a straight line

28
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.600
"across the universe.

29
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.120
"you must eventually come
to the end of the universe.

30
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.920
"Or the edge of the universe.

31
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.480
"And if so. what is beyond?"

32
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480
Well. of course.
that kind of mind-boggling question

33
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240
really set me thinking.

34
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.480
and it's kept me going until today.

35
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.720
My father. Gerry Anderson.

36
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320
produced 18 series
and four feature films.

37
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.560
owned six Rolls-Royce motor cars.

38
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.280
had four children.
across three marriages.

39
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.960
and made and lost his fortune
twice over.

40
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.600
But beyond these headlines.

41
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.840
I actually know very little
about the man that I call Dad.

42
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760
What inspired him?

43
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280
Why was he never satisfied
with his work?

44
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.760
Why were his relationships
so fractious?

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840
I've been loaned my very own FAB 1
to make a journey of discovery.

46
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.120
visiting some of the key locations

47
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920
and speaking to some of his closest
family. friends. and colleagues.

48
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.960
with the hope that I will finally be
able to understand what made the man

49
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.000
who. for many.
made their childhoods.

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800
OK. Venus?
OK. Steve.

51
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.920
Right. let's go.

52
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.200
Very few people know
anything about my background.

53
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.160
I don't once remember him telling me
about a happy childhood experience.

54
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.880
I was in a house. an old house.
living right at the top.

55
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.680
in one room. with my family.

56
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.920
He spent a lot of time
drumming into me

57
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.840
how poor his family were
when they grew up.

58
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.680
Down below. we had a woman.
a very old lady.

59
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.080
who used to bang on the ceiling
with her stick.

60
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.880
It was Neasden. it was bleak.

61
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960
Opposite. we had a man -
I can't remember his name now -

62
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.800
but he was just fresh out of jail.

63
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.200
And on the bottom floor.
we had a mad artist

64
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.160
and a prostitute.

65
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.920
I think that Dad's climb
from the poverty of childhood

66
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
was the most important endeavour
in his life.

67
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.760
It's only right
that a bloke should have ambition.

68
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.240
But that constant drive for success
was probably quite damaging for him.

69
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200
because in his mind.
he never reached it.

70
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.720
I always feel that I have failed.

71
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.960
You know that failure
cannot be tolerated.

72
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.560
I think Dad's drive to succeed

73
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.000
was probably due to the way
he was brought up by his parents.

74
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.520
And. I suppose.
the way that they were raised. too.

75
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.040
First of all. dealing with my
grandparents on my father's side.

76
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.880
they were Jewish.

77
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.120
They came as immigrants
to this country.

78
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.760
And when they arrived here.

79
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.840
the immigration people said
to my grandfather. "Name?"

80
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.160
And he said. "Bieloglovski."

81
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.840
And the immigration officer said.

82
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.440
"I can't possibly spell that.
Your name's Abrahams."

83
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.120
And so that was his name.

84
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.000
Now. on my mother's side.

85
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.120
my grandmother lived in Hackney.

86
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.640
and the family. that's on her side.

87
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.160
all grew up to be very.
very Christian.

88
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.880
Now. when I say Christian.
I don't mean they went to church.

89
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.320
but I mean very English.

90
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.400
It was...

91
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.240
a tough place to be. as a child.

92
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.200
between two parents
locked in battle.

93
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.240
They had a lot of arguments.
and it wasn't a happy marriage.

94
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.680
They should never have been married
in the first place.

95
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.960
but there we are. they were.

96
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.880
I loved Grandpa Joe.
he was a lovely man.

97
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.160
But he wasn't for Grandma Debbie.
And she...

98
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.520
She was very unhappy her whole life.

99
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.760
My mother was kind of always
saying how she hated him.

100
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.480
hated the marriage.

101
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.520
But the mixture was explosive.

102
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.960
Sometimes my father.
there would be a row going on.

103
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.600
and she would say.
"I'm going to bed".

104
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.280
and he would say. "No. you're not".
and he would lock the door.

105
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.680
And I'd have to sit in a locked room
for maybe three hours

106
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.880
while these two were going
hammer and tongs at each other.

107
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.160
And consequently. I had just about

108
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.480
the most miserable childhood
it's possible to imagine.

109
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.600
I think it's inevitable
that Gerry's upbringing.

110
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.440
and the struggles he had.
would feed into his work.

111
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.080
Because. you know.
that's what all good creatives do.

112
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.840
They take what they know
and put it into their work.

113
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840
Do you remember how it all started?

114
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.840
I guess none of us
will ever forget that day.

115
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.480
I was brought up. really.

116
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.000
by a mother
who didn't want to be Jewish.

117
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.800
didn't want to have anything
to do with the Jewish religion.

118
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.120
and by my father. who was Jewish.

119
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.040
and did want to have
a lot to do with religion.

120
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.320
I think her...

121
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.400
..her non-Jewish beliefs
actually extend far beyond that.

122
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.320
Gerry's mother
was unbelievably anti-Semitic.

123
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.800
One day.
this was just before the war.

124
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.680
a laundry boy came
to collect the laundry.

125
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.840
which was in a sheet tied up
with a list on it.

126
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.920
and he took the laundry. very
cheerfully. "Thank you very much".

127
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.040
and she walked back.

128
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.440
perhaps to get the money for the
last week's laundry. I don't know.

129
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.480
and he said. "Hold on a minute."

130
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.560
He had seen the name Abrahams.

131
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.920
And as she was returning.
he shouted out.

132
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.120
"We don't take laundry from Jews."

133
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.840
And he threw the laundry.
which hit her fair and square.

134
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.960
and slammed the door.

135
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.600
He was teased...
for having a Jewish surname.

136
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.800
I also remember at Neasden.
going to school.

137
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.880
and kids dancing in a circle
around me. saying "Jew boy".

138
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.360
So I think he very quickly
developed feelings. as a kid.

139
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.200
that religion was a thing
that only brought negativity.

140
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.640
I don't really think
you'll find much. if any religion

141
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.280
in any of the shows
because of that.

142
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.720
So. with the aid of my mother.
I totally rebelled.

143
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.520
So she.
after a considerable argument.

144
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.480
forced my father to change
the family name by deed poll.

145
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.720
I remember her saying.
"I always liked the name Anderson."

146
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.760
I know that name.

147
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.200
From everything I can tell.
from what he said.

148
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.480
as a child.
he was very close to his mum.

149
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.360
and actually. with hindsight.

150
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.280
he can see that
she was quite a manipulator.

151
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.440
And she never had a kind word
to say for anybody.

152
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.680
I grew up. rightly or wrongly.
very. very much on my mother's side.

153
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.200
So my father was the enemy.
and I was an ally to my mother.

154
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.800
Therefore. I inherited all her ways.
and I hated his ways.

155
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.760
He became a mummy's boy not because
Debbie was a wonderful mother.

156
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.520
but because she set the stage

157
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.080
for Joe being a useless.
ugly. lazy. slovenly man.

158
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.520
My mother used to humiliate him.

159
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.560
And. er...

160
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.640
When I was a kid.
she used to say to me. jokingly.

161
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.840
"Come on. you ugly devil.

162
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.200
"you look more like your dad
every day of the week."

163
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.160
It used to break my heart. you know.

164
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.560
Because I was brought up to think
that my father was ugly.

165
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.800
So when she would say that to me.
I used to get very upset about it.

166
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.320
Gerry's relationship
with his father.

167
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.160
I think only began to heal

168
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.880
only a short time
before Joe's death.

169
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.320
But it was almost too late.
because he was taken ill.

170
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.440
he went into hospital.

171
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.400
and I believe up until the day
he had his final heart attack.

172
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.160
he was still waiting on Debbie
hand and foot.

173
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.040
When I arrived.

174
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.480
my mother was actually
talking to a neighbour

175
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.080
about the pain she'd been having
in her stomach.

176
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.400
and how she felt sick.
and all the rest of it.

177
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.400
And my father came in
with a tray of tea.

178
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.800
Tea. m'lady?

179
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800
Tea on the lawn.

180
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.000
And he had just had a heart attack.

181
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.680
And an ambulance arrived.
and he was taken to hospital.

182
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.520
And it was just about when
Thunderbirds was due to premiere.

183
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.000
And he was in hospital.
I think in Maidenhead.

184
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.480
and Gerry was so proud.

185
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.800
cos he managed to get
a television set into the ward.

186
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.520
And he was semiconscious when
they wheeled over a television set

187
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.120
for one of the first showings
of Thunderbirds.

188
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.320
We're not really sure if he could
hear it. or see it properly.

189
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.960
but we've got notes
that suggest how proud Joe was

190
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.160
of what his son had achieved.

191
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.920
It was very important to Gerry

192
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.880
that Joe had seen him
hit the heights. as it were.

193
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.960
Get some rest now. Dad.
I'll see you tomorrow.

194
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.880
When he died. he said something
to me which was incomprehensible.

195
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.920
and I said. "I can't understand."

196
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.800
And he said it again. and I said.
"I can't understand."

197
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.640
And he said. "Can I have a pencil?"

198
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.240
And he...

199
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.800
He wrote...

200
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.480
"It all happened

201
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.480
"because..."

202
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.520
And he lapsed into unconsciousness.

203
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.400
And I. to this day. never know
what it was he was going to write.

204
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.200
He must have had a terrible life.

205
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.920
Yeah. course. if I could live
my time over again.

206
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.840
I would have been much closer
to my father than I was.

207
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.360
Why did I wait so long?

208
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.160
Oh. John. you didn't know.

209
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.920
I just feel very sad now
at the way I treated him.

210
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.400
And in fact.
that's a very interesting point.

211
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.560
You will see few. if any.
"mother" figures

212
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.000
in any of the work that Gerry did.

213
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.800
Right. Father.
OK. Father.

214
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.520
Sure thing. Dad.
Yeah. Father.

215
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.680
What's happened. Father?

216
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.960
My father is an honourable man.

217
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.080
When my mother died. I had to try
to be a mother and a father to him.

218
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.440
It's not as if you had a mother
to look after you.

219
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.080
so don't let me down.

220
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.160
I think the only happiness
he found in his childhood

221
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.120
was with his brother.

222
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.920
This older brother was
the only thing he looked up to.

223
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.440
was the only thing that almost
made life worth living. I suppose.

224
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.920
Lionel Anderson
was Gerry's older brother.

225
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.400
older by. I think. seven years.

226
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.760
Good-looking guy.

227
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.360
Gerry absolutely idolised him.

228
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.680
I think Lionel
was almost godlike to him.

229
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.360
When the war broke out. I was 11.
and he was joining up.

230
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.280
so I guess he was probably 18.

231
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.320
It wasn't really until the war
that I used to see very much of him.

232
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.720
I just have very strong
recollections

233
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.200
from the things he did.

234
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.280
I mean. during the Blitz. he was
Light Rescue. and so he was a hero.

235
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.000
Lionel was a classic boy
growing up in the '30s.

236
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.480
late '30s. early '40s.

237
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.560
Loved everything to do with
aeroplanes.

238
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.040
loved everything to do with speed.
transport.

239
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.440
The opportunity
to join the Royal Air Force

240
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.520
would have been something
that was massively exciting to him.

241
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.200
Debbie doted on Lionel.

242
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.920
clearly was much fonder of him
than she was of Gerry.

243
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.800
You almost feel like
Gerry was an afterthought.

244
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.080
So all of her focus and love.
you feel.

245
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.720
is directed towards one person.

246
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.640
Gerry mentioned his brother
numerous times.

247
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.040
He was very proud of his brother

248
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.000
and his contribution
to the Second World War.

249
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.480
What happened was he was sent
to Arizona for his training.

250
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.280
Cos you couldn't train over England.

251
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.160
you'd be shot down
by German aircraft.

252
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.400
So he was sent to Arizona.
to an airfield called Falcon Field.

253
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.200
He was an inveterate letter writer.

254
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.880
I'm sure Debbie read
and re-read and re-read them.

255
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.400
and read them out loud to Gerry.

256
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.440
And judging from his letters.

257
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.800
he seems to have maintained

258
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.920
a much more healthy relationship
with my parents than I did.

259
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.600
Nothing I can see in the letters

260
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.680
that suggests a close relationship
with his father.

261
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.400
His mother. on the other hand.
is a totally different relationship.

262
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.600
A very intense relationship.

263
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.720
It probably wasn't
a healthy relationship.

264
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.360
I think as a role model.

265
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.960
Lionel would have been something

266
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.920
that was almost impossible
for Gerry to live up to.

267
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.600
I mean. if you've got a brother
who's flying an aircraft

268
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.640
over Nazi-occupied Europe
every night.

269
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.880
obviously one naturally
thought of him as a hero.

270
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.200
Let's face it. he was a hero.
Like all of them.

271
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.240
He's quite a guy.
Yeah.

272
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.360
And that is a thing

273
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.520
which I would hear him repeat
over and over and over.

274
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.080
And he painted quite the picture
of this hero pilot.

275
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.240
It felt very much

276
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.000
like he was the most positive
influence in Dad's life.

277
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.560
I think it was from Lionel that
he got the idea for Thunderbirds.

278
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.080
or certainly the name
for Thunderbirds.

279
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.560
Obviously Lionel's having
an opportunity to do things

280
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:17.200
that Gerry could only dream about.
and yet his brother is achieving.

281
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.000
I mean. Hollywood came to Lionel.

282
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.200
He was at Falcon Field

283
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.080
when an American film crew.
producer. turned up

284
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.640
to shoot a film.

285
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.000
and it involved some of
the big actors at the time.

286
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.880
He danced with Gene Tierney
when they had a party there.

287
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.960
And there was another Hollywood star
called Preston Foster

288
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.040
that he wrote about.

289
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.000
All of the cadets are actually
brought into the film

290
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.840
to parade. to march past. to be
in group scenes. what have you.

291
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.600
and they can clearly see that
they're actually in this film.

292
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.080
And the name of that film will be
very familiar to everyone.

293
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.320
because the film was called
Thunder Birds.

294
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.760
Cor. so that explains it!

295
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.360
It must have been a huge blow to him
when Lionel. you know.

296
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.000
died.

297
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.760
After his squadron
converted to flying the Mosquito.

298
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.560
they also changed roles.

299
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.840
and his role now
was as an Intruder pilot.

300
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.280
And what that meant was that they
flew ahead of the bomber stream

301
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.080
to shoot up German night fighter
stations.

302
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.840
Every morning when the postman came.

303
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.160
it was just the dread of receiving
the telegram. Which finally came.

304
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.680
And it was while
on one of those Intruder sorties

305
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.160
that. sadly. Lionel was shot down.

306
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.080
"The Air Ministry regret to report

307
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.880
"that your son.
Lionel David Anderson.

308
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.560
"failed to return from an operation
over enemy territory

309
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.920
"and has been posted as missing."

310
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.880
It would have been
absolutely catastrophic.

311
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.920
Because although there would have
been an element of hope.

312
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.000
the reality is. though.
that word "missing"

313
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.200
invariably meant "dead."

314
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200
He didn't make it.

315
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.920
He just didn't make it.

316
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.920
My mother was
a very emotional person.

317
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.960
and. er...

318
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.720
she tended to wear her heart
on her sleeve.

319
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.560
I'm aware. anecdotally.

320
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.840
that Debbie is purported
to have said...

321
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.240
"It should have been you.

322
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.640
"Why was it Lionel?
It should have been you."

323
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.640
And I think if we add that
to the fact

324
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.480
that she created nigh on a shrine
for Lionel.

325
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.920
with this portrait
that used to hang.

326
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.600
and she would show everyone
who came around.

327
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.360
I think there's a lot of credibility
to that story.

328
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.640
You wouldn't forget something that
a parent had said to you like that.

329
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.760
Well. my brother - and I'm quite
serious when I say this -

330
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.000
he really should have lived.

331
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.960
and I should have been the one
that was killed.

332
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.560
And I just feel that. really.
he was more suited

333
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.360
to go through this life than I was.

334
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.920
And I would happily
have swapped places with him.

335
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.320
I think if you look back
on the episodes of his shows.

336
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.560
you'll find that there are always
strong characters who are pilots.

337
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.000
I think the action figures.
with Mike Mercury.

338
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.960
with Scott. and with Virgil.
to a degree.

339
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.840
I think these
are all hero characters

340
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.680
who probably embody certain elements
of Lionel in them.

341
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.120
You saved our lives.
I'm glad we could help.

342
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.640
All I know is somewhere out there.

343
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.440
there's a living creature
in distress.

344
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.120
I can't let that call go unanswered.

345
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.680
Before his death.
Lionel wrote a letter home

346
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.000
in which he joked with Dad

347
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.120
about wanting him to do well
in school and make lots of money.

348
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.880
so he could look after Lionel
when he returned.

349
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.520
But for various reasons. that
wasn't really an option for Dad.

350
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.760
I was never gonna become anything
at secondary school.

351
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.280
I'd like to think I had flair.
and certainly common sense.

352
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.680
but in terms
of academic qualifications.

353
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.040
I was just. you know.
like a barrow boy.

354
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.520
He was not a fan of school at all.

355
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.920
I don't think he took
his education seriously.

356
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.080
I think his schooling
had been pretty poor.

357
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.680
had been pretty broken up. because
he was evacuated in the war.

358
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.800
Dragged off with Debbie with.
you know. "I'm leaving Joe again"

359
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.240
and all the rest of it.

360
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.880
He had trouble reading and writing.
which he later claimed was dyslexia.

361
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.520
although I think
it's probably just poor education.

362
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.640
His handwriting was... not great.

363
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.640
But he always tried his best
to cover for it.

364
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.680
He didn't want people to know
that he was ill-educated.

365
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.320
or. you know. had trouble
with reading and writing.

366
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.120
He had wanted to be
a fibrous plasterer.

367
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.920
When I say plastering.
this was ornamental plastering.

368
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.120
not plastering walls.

369
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.720
And I really excelled.
and I was top of the class.

370
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.640
And so. obviously.
I was going to become a plasterer.

371
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.680
And who uses plasterers?

372
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.840
The answer is. film studios.

373
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.400
Oh. films?

374
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.360
Oh. that must be
a very exciting life.

375
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.400
Very soon after he started
this training in plastering.

376
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.720
he was having terrible rashes
and skin peeling up his forearms.

377
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.040
And it turned out
it gave him dermatitis.

378
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.360
It was really horrible.
and the doctor said.

379
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.480
"Well. it's obviously the lime
and the plaster that's causing this.

380
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.120
"and there's no way
that you can become a plasterer."

381
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.400
Well. I had already set my heart
on studios. films.

382
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.560
I really knew nothing about it.

383
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.520
And I spent a very. very long time

384
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.920
walking around
from studio to studio.

385
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.320
saying to the gate men.
"Are there any jobs going?"

386
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.920
And this was obviously
the start of everything.

387
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.040
My father. through a relative
of a relative of a relative.

388
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.680
knew Sidney Bernstein.
who was chairman of Granada.

389
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.400
And he managed to get me
an interview with the great man.

390
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.360
And I went along. and he said.
"What do you want to be?"

391
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.600
And I said. "A cameraman."

392
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.480
And he said. "Well. look.
everybody wants to be a cameraman.

393
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.560
"I'm going to put a date
in my diary.

394
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.480
"If you come back
in six months' time

395
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.160
"and tell me that you still
want to become a cameraman.

396
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.960
"I will give you a job
on a camera crew."

397
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.120
Dad was never hugely patient.

398
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.480
What I remember very clearly
is when he said "six months' time".

399
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.120
he might as well have said
"45 years' time".

400
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.800
It seemed such a huge amount of time
to wait.

401
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.000
So I came out and just dismissed
him and the interview from my mind.

402
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.800
and I thought.
"If I'm gonna be a cameraman.

403
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.160
"I might as well do
something to do with photography."

404
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.240
So I walked into Regent Studios.
on Regent Street.

405
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.720
which is a little passport studio.

406
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.240
and I was a developist.

407
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.720
He then managed to get a job

408
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.000
with the Ministry of Information's
Colonial Film Unit.

409
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.480
And I did. as a trainee. projection.

410
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.040
and camera crew. and editing.
and so on.

411
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.120
And so I decided that I would work
in the cutting room.

412
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.520
And from there. I heard that
there was a vacancy going

413
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.320
in Gainsborough Pictures.

414
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.880
FANFARE

415
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.880
And so that's how
I really came to be

416
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.320
a member
of the British film business.

417
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.560
In the late 1940s. I think 1947.

418
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.520
he was called up to the RAF.

419
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.000
The joining up of the RAF

420
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.320
was something which
he had been dreading.

421
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.920
because he was such a mummy's boy.

422
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.720
When I finished my initial training.

423
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.960
we took a so-called
intelligence test.

424
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.320
and I was then interviewed
by the education officer.

425
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.160
and he said.

426
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.800
"Well. you have very.
very low marks.

427
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.520
"In fact. so low.
that we can only offer you

428
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.240
"either general duties
in the cookhouse..."

429
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.920
If I cooked like you.
I wouldn't shout about it neither.

430
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.840
"..or military police."

431
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.880
Which says something
for the military police.

432
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.920
He said. "What did you do
on civvy street?"

433
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.800
And I told him I was
an assistant film editor.

434
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.680
and I could see he was
quite startled by that.

435
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.560
And then he offered me
a so-called C-trade.

436
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.440
which allowed me to become
a radiotelephone operator.

437
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.600
which I did.

438
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.520
Dad exited the RAF in 1949.

439
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.560
With good grades across the board.

440
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.280
So he must have been proud of that.

441
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.920
We were very fortunate. really.

442
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.680
because people who were called up
for National Service

443
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.600
had to be reinstated in the job
they held when they left.

444
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.120
And so when I came out.
I was sent to Pinewood Studios.

445
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.800
And he very quickly
rose through the ranks.

446
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.240
from sound editor. to assistant
film editor. to film editor.

447
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.880
He also met Betty Wrightman.
who he soon married.

448
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.520
And they quite quickly had Linda.
first daughter.

449
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.480
and then quite soon after that.
Joy. second daughter.

450
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.480
After being jettisoned from the RAF.

451
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.520
his personal life and his career
seemed to be taking off.

452
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.560
After a couple of years. he found
himself working for a company

453
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.320
called Polytechnic Films.
where he was appointed director

454
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.360
on a series called
You've Never Seen This.

455
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.400
which. ironically. was never seen.

456
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.480
And it was whilst
working on that series

457
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.800
that he met his future
business partner. Arthur Provis.

458
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.840
And that's how we got together.
and we became very friendly.

459
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.400
And so when that ill-fated series
came to an end.

460
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.880
we said. "Why don't we start
our own production company?"

461
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.280
Which we did.

462
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.280
Hence AP Films.
Anderson and Provis.

463
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.080
We got on very. very. well.

464
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.000
and we took with us
some friends that we had met.

465
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.640
Reg Hill. brilliant man.

466
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.360
And John Read.

467
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.360
We started the company.
and we needed a secretary.

468
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.880
And there's a very interesting thing
here.

469
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.240
because we advertised
for a part-time secretary.

470
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.000
When you were growing up.

471
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.640
what did you want to be
when you grew up?

472
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.520
Er... I could say "famous."

473
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.720
So we put an advert
in the local paper

474
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.880
for a secretary for two days a week.

475
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.080
I didn't know how to get into
the film business at all.

476
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.880
and then one day. I saw an ad.
you know. in a newspaper.

477
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.760
a small film company
looking for a Girl Friday.

478
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.840
I thought. "Oh. I can do that."

479
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.760
And I received a call.
in response to that advert.

480
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.040
from a very jolly lady.

481
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.360
who said.
"Yes. I can keep you all in order.

482
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.280
"it sounds very interesting.
and I'd love to do it."

483
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.160
And a couple of hours later.
my partner. Arthur Provis.

484
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.160
received a call from Sylvia Thamm.

485
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.960
And then I got a call from them.
really desperate.

486
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.000
And. er...

487
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.680
So. at the end of the day. I said.

488
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.680
"I think the lady who called me
would be ideal."

489
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.960
And he said. "The lady who called me
was wonderful.

490
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.040
"I'm sure she'd be right."

491
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.680
And we got on very well. so we said.
"Let's not argue about it."

492
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.560
so we flipped a coin.
and Sylvia got the job.

493
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:14.000
Right from the word go.
she meant to have Gerry.

494
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.240
And I mean. I liked her.
I was very intrigued by her.

495
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.960
because she had been divorced twice.

496
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.480
and I'd never met anybody
who'd been divorced even once.

497
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.640
And I was very naive.

498
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.240
And I have wondered.
on many occasions.

499
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.560
had that coin
landed the other way up.

500
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.960
things would be very different
today.

501
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.800
You feeling regret?

502
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.640
No. no. Just curious.

503
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.720
The company really just sat dormant.

504
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.520
with its telephones and notepaper
and filing cabinet.

505
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.680
empty filing cabinet.
waiting for the phone to ring.

506
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.600
I thought. naively.
that people would ring and say.

507
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.280
"Good morning.
I'd like to order some films.

508
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.120
"So. we'd like one feature film.
three commercials

509
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.440
"and two documentaries."

510
00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.520
Before you know it. Dr Beaker.
you'll be filming in Hollywood.

511
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.280
Of course. that didn't happen.

512
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.760
I think we made a commercial
for Little Noddy.

513
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.880
For one of the Ricicles.

514
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.320
Hello. children.
It's me. Little Noddy.

515
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.960
We were sort of scratching around.

516
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.240
thinking.
"My God. the phone's not ringing."

517
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.960
But finally. and just as we were
about to close the company.

518
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.680
a woman by the name of Roberta Leigh
turned up on the doorstep.

519
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.000
Who was driving a Rolls-Royce.
and she had the chauffeur.

520
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
and she sort of swanned in

521
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.720
and announced herself.
that she was a children's author.

522
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.640
And said she'd heard
we'd made some puppet commercials.

523
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.920
and she'd got this idea
called Twizzle.

524
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.720
and were we interested?

525
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.560
So that's basically how we met.

526
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.280
He was desperate to get a job
when he came to me.

527
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.320
He'd made a Noddy commercial.

528
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.040
She was a rich lady.
and a bit out of our league. really.

529
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.840
And they couldn't get started.

530
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.880
Roberta was quite difficult
to deal with.

531
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.960
And we found later

532
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.040
that she was going around
to all the different companies

533
00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.880
and getting the cheapest quote.

534
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.120
And that's how we were introduced
into the world of puppetry.

535
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.280
I mean. I can't tell you
how upset I was.

536
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.640
you know.
to be making bloody puppet films.

537
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.600
Hey. manners. manners!

538
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.400
But they turned out
to be his fortune.

539
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.040
And it was actually at that point
that he started to make...

540
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.920
real technical advances.

541
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.720
because he was so embarrassed
by puppets.

542
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.760
And then he got offered
another puppet series.

543
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.520
Gerry Anderson.
him and I were like brothers.

544
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.240
We even shared a car at one stage.
when we couldn't afford two.

545
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.280
And. er...

546
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.320
He was a wonderful chap.

547
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.000
One of the most honest chaps
I've ever met in my life.

548
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.360
I don't know if there was
any specific moment

549
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.680
that the relationship ended.

550
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.800
But as time went on.
that started to fray a little.

551
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.560
Not because of any fallings out.

552
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.320
Gerry says it was because he wanted
to buy the place we were in

553
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.800
for some amazing amount of money.
and I didn't agree with it.

554
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.840
He's convinced that was the reason.

555
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.800
I don't think
that was entirely the reason.

556
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.080
Dad wanted to push forward
and do bigger and better things.

557
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.280
and make more technical advances.

558
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.520
And there was a lot of risk
involved in that.

559
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.640
They were two different people.

560
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.720
I was rather more careful
than Gerry. Gerry would have a go.

561
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.320
And I tended to be careful.

562
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.320
And it gradually made me
more and more nervous.

563
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.960
Not a bit like Gerry.
He didn't want to do anything.

564
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.520
and Gerry wanted to go all in.

565
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.840
I thought we'd get ourselves
into a lot of trouble.

566
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.680
When we made Four Feather Falls.

567
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.040
this is where my relationship
with Sylvia developed

568
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.080
and my marriage broke up.

569
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.960
Arthur was horrified by the way
Gerry was carrying on with Sylvia

570
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.560
when he had a wife and two babies.

571
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.280
And I decided to go.

572
00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:01.240
Now. I was really ill-equipped
to have a serious relationship.

573
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.320
She was. and is.
a very. very nice person.

574
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.960
I personally don't think
that we were really suited.

575
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.840
I think when he married Mum.
he hadn't matured emotionally.

576
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.520
He hadn't left home. he hadn't had
girlfriends before my mum.

577
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.800
They were kind of pushed into it.

578
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.160
and it wouldn't have
run a long term.

579
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.600
whatever had happened.
whether he had met Sylvia or not.

580
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.800
It was doomed from the start.

581
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.760
I certainly. today. I look back.
and think. "What an awful thing."

582
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.920
If I could replay it.

583
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.200
I certainly would never have
allowed it to happen again.

584
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.720
It's too late now.

585
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720
Yeah.

586
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.800
Too late.

587
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.240
Joy and Linda had a tough time.

588
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.600
because their parents separated
when they were both quite young.

589
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.000
I never told anybody
who my father was.

590
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.520
Sylvia was the new partner.

591
00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.960
She was not particularly sensitive
to our needs.

592
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.560
Me and my sister
lived at home with Mum.

593
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.080
And we used to go and see Daddy
once a fortnight.

594
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.680
He came and picked us up.

595
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.240
There's pictures of us
all together as a family.

596
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.440
and it really is very constructed.

597
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.880
When Gerry's first marriage failed.
he was quite young.

598
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.880
And I think probably
he didn't realise

599
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.920
how badly affected
the girls would be.

600
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.160
We were sitting at the tea table
in the kitchen.

601
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.880
and of course. by then.
we were used to him not being there.

602
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.880
And Mum said. "There's something
I need to tell you.

603
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.960
"Daddy and I
are going to get divorced."

604
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.240
And I said. "Why?"

605
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.040
Although it's bonkers. because
he hadn't been there for ages.

606
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.000
So. Mummy said. "Well. Daddy
doesn't love Mummy any more."

607
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.280
And I said. "Well. if he doesn't
love Mummy. then I don't love him."

608
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.440
When we were kids. and we went
to spend the weekend with Daddy.

609
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.040
I mean. the contrast was incredible.

610
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.520
Because Mum was struggling.
She did three jobs.

611
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.360
She was a secretary. she was a
seamstress. and she worked in a pub.

612
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.000
He was picking us up in his Roller.
and she was doing three jobs.

613
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.440
And then we'd go

614
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.400
and have a completely different
lifestyle for two days.

615
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.440
And. er...

616
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.040
As the years went by.
we drifted apart.

617
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.000
Erm...

618
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.800
We just bec...
We just became estranged. I think.

619
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.880
The great sadness is...

620
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.920
that Dad...

621
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:50.000
I don't think ever really conveyed
to any of them how he truly felt.

622
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.160
He talked about it in private.
to very. very few people.

623
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.080
that it was a great source
of regret to him

624
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.960
that he was not able
to bring those kids up.

625
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.120
I don't think Daddy had a very good
model for happy marriages.

626
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.120
That's not what
he'd experienced growing up.

627
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.200
I mean. they came back on the scene
later. which was nice.

628
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.400
I was living in London
and a friend of mine came over.

629
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.680
and she said to me.

630
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.480
"Did you know your dad's on
at the Barbican tonight?"

631
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.280
"Why don't I take you?
He's doing a book signing."

632
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.240
And I said. "Oh. I don't know.
I haven't seen him for ages."

633
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.000
And she said. "Oh. go on.

634
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.320
"It's about time you two got
together". blah. blah. blah.

635
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.720
So we went. and he did a talk.
and it was really interesting.

636
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.280
Good evening.
Thank you for coming along tonight.

637
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.320
And I was sitting
right in the front row.

638
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.840
but I hadn't seen him for so long.
he didn't know what I looked like.

639
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.960
So when we came out.

640
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.560
everyone was queueing up
to get their books signed.

641
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.320
and when I got to
the front of the queue.

642
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.040
I gave him my book. and he said.

643
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.640
"What would you like me
to write in your book?"

644
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.000
And I said. "You could write.
'To Joy. love Dad.'"

645
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.640
And. erm...
Which he nearly had a heart attack.

646
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.920
Dad's failure to maintain
personal relationships

647
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.120
began to impact
his professional life

648
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.040
almost as soon as it had started.

649
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.320
I didn't get along very well
with Roberta Leigh.

650
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.760
and I didn't...

651
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.280
You know. in fairness.
maybe she didn't like me either.

652
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.360
He's a very evil... A very evil man.

653
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.600
But I decided that we should
really do our own series now.

654
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.000
Our position was precarious

655
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
right up until the time
I met Lew Grade.

656
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.560
We were going under.

657
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.840
And we had made Four Feather Falls.

658
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.600
And I remember.

659
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.240
we sent the last completed film
to Granada by post.

660
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.880
And back came a cheque.
the final payment.

661
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.520
And we waited for somebody
from Granada to say.

662
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.600
"Well. what are you going
to do next?"

663
00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.920
And I haven't heard from Granada
to this day!

664
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.000
And Gerry and Reg had come up with
an idea. I think with Barry Gray.

665
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.240
about a car
that could do everything.

666
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.600
Which was Supercar.

667
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.760
I was hoping that
somebody would say.

668
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.120
"This is wonderful.
how much money do you want?"

669
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.160
And of course. that didn't happen.

670
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.520
and we. again.
were about to close our studio

671
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.640
when a man by the name
of Connery Chappell came to see us

672
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.080
and said. "I know a man
whose name is Lew Grade.

673
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.000
"I'm sure he would be interested."

674
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.640
And he made an appointment.

675
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.080
So Gerry went up
and met with Lew Grade.

676
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.800
And I showed him the brochure.
and I remember him looking at it.

677
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:45.440
and he said. "Yeah. looks good.
How much is it going to cost?"

678
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.640
Let's say it was something
like £3.000 an episode.

679
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.640
I remember Lew slammed the desk
with his fist -

680
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.080
I mean. it frightened
the living daylights out of me -

681
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.640
and he said. "I can't possibly
afford that sort of money

682
00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.600
"for a children's show."

683
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.600
And then I think he must have seen
that I looked very frightened.

684
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.000
and so he then became very kind
and said.

685
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.040
"Look. Gerry.
I tell you what you do.

686
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.080
"Let me see. the time now
is five o'clock.

687
00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.800
"Go back to the studio.

688
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.880
"come back tomorrow and tell me
you've cut that price in half.

689
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.000
"and I'll give you a contract
for 26 shows."

690
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.280
Well. I was in my car.
going back to Lew.

691
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.360
I had failed.
We had cut a third off the budget.

692
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.000
And I went up.
and I was nearly in tears.

693
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.120
I'm sure I was smelling like
a polecat.

694
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.000
I hadn't shaved. been up all night.

695
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.320
And I said...

696
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.720
I said. "I'm terribly sorry.

697
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.400
"but there's no way
we can cut it in half.

698
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.640
"But we've managed
to cut off a third."

699
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.400
And Lew said.
"OK. you've got a deal."

700
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.960
And on the strength of that.
we went into production.

701
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.160
So. what are we waiting for?

702
00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.760
This is just the start of
a long. friendly relationship.

703
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.320
We were probably the dot-com company
of the '60s.

704
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.160
That's what we were there.

705
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.760
Looking back. I think Gerry
was the king of hardware.

706
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.400
and Sylvia
was the queen of software.

707
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.120
At first. I lived with her.

708
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.280
She owned a little. tiny cottage
in Bourne End.

709
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.320
and I moved in with her there.

710
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.480
And I think here. again.

711
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.200
all that would be fitting
for me to say

712
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.680
is that you can't marry somebody
unless there is something there.

713
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.240
I mean. you don't meet somebody

714
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.480
and say. "God. I hate you.
will you marry me?"

715
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.200
There obviously was a time
where we got on very well.

716
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.480
and I was very attracted to her.

717
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.520
The marriage...

718
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.400
started to get bumpy
shortly afterwards.

719
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.720
It became progressively more bumpy.

720
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.480
It became stormy.

721
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.240
In the extreme.

722
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.960
The storm's getting worse.

723
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.560
It has to be stressed that
she has her story. This is mine.

724
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.680
Sylvia wanted to get married
in Caxton Hall.

725
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.480
Which was the grand venue

726
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.480
for people who wanted to have
big. grand. flashy weddings.

727
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.880
And I suppose it was the first time
I had realised

728
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.320
that she was very keen on publicity.

729
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.400
Certainly. all the photographs
you see of the two of them.

730
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.480
she's kind of centre stage.

731
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.800
and Gerry's looking maybe
slightly embarrassed.

732
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.840
or rather that he'd
be somewhere else.

733
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:41.040
Gerry was quite happy not receiving
the same sort of publicity.

734
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.400
He really didn't want
to be in the public eye.

735
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.320
And obviously that caused tension.

736
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.360
She was. and could have been.
an incredible help to me.

737
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.600
She helped me by reading scripts.

738
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.120
I used to dictate the scripts
to her.

739
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.840
On Thunderbirds. I dictated
the whole script straight off.

740
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.920
From the time I can remember.

741
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.640
he had a... either an Amstrad
or a Peacock computer.

742
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.200
which had a 25 MB hard drive.

743
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.080
And he would sit at it and type.

744
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.080
Gerry was a one-finger typer.

745
00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.760
A slow and painful process.

746
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.640
When he was writing a script. he
would quite often either dictate it

747
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.560
and I would take it down on paper.

748
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.280
or I would type it straight
as he was dictating it.

749
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.640
I was just the mechanism
to get it onto the paper.

750
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.520
He'd always dictated his scripts.
I think.

751
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.560
And I remember to this day.
we were sitting on the balcony

752
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.920
of our apartment in Albufeira.

753
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.640
and I said.
"There is one more thing.

754
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.400
"right on the front.
'by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.'"

755
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.240
A thing I've always regretted.

756
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.600
Because it wasn't
by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.

757
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.400
When it came to the nitty-gritty

758
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.440
and the sweat of scripting
until the early hours.

759
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.920
you know. when things were wrong.

760
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.000
no. she wasn't there.

761
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.520
The way we worked.
Gerry had the ideas.

762
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.040
the adventure. the Boys' Own
adventure. if you like.

763
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.560
and the idea for the...

764
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.960
And later on.
obviously we met with our team.

765
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.800
and they came up with ideas.

766
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.880
A husband-and-wife team.
that was invented by the media.

767
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.360
There were four directors.

768
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.800
Myself. Reg Hill. Sylvia
and John Read.

769
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.920
The team was four people.

770
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.840
But he was the creative force.

771
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.520
He was the one with the vision.
is what we all thought.

772
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.520
I think that I've always had
a sort of a storehouse

773
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.400
of unconnected ideas.

774
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.240
and if somebody says.

775
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.760
"Look. I want a script
for a new series a week from now."

776
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.960
it's a question of getting
all these latent ideas out

777
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.920
and putting them together
and making a new show.

778
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.560
The idea for Thunderbirds
really came to me

779
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.760
as a result
of a German mine disaster

780
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.720
which happened in 1963.

781
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.440
What happened was
that the mine was flooded.

782
00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.560
A lake over the top suddenly
went straight down into the mine.

783
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.080
And there were many miners
trapped in air pockets.

784
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.440
some 1.000 feet below ground.

785
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.920
And I avidly listened to
the news bulletins every day

786
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.680
to hear the progress.

787
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.520
and they were finally rescued.

788
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.880
And so I started to think a rescue
story would be really great.

789
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.400
Look. there are 600 people up there
with about 40 minutes to live.

790
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.080
Now. you can't help them.
but I believe we can.

791
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.240
If it were to be a rescue story
in a science fiction setting.

792
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.520
then of course we had to have
some very modern aircraft.

793
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.880
And so the series. you know.
was gradually formed.

794
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.280
But who should take credit
for the shows

795
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.680
became increasingly unclear
as time went on.

796
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.720
Dad and Sylvia's memories of
the creative process seem to differ.

797
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.280
and remain contentious to this day.

798
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.440
Thunderbirds are go.

799
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.360
I was at a press conference...

800
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.160
Looks like the action's gonna start.

801
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.920
..and everybody was
yattering away. and what a noise.

802
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.440
and drinking.
and all the rest of it.

803
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.080
and I'm talking to a guy
from the press.

804
00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.760
and she has a very piercing voice.

805
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.800
You can hear it
from a long way away.

806
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.480
And I heard her say.

807
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.080
"Well. the way it works is
I sort of do all the creative work.

808
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.120
"the characters. the scripting.
all the ideas.

809
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.640
"and Gerry looks after the cameras.
that sort of thing."

810
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.720
Well. I could have turned around
and...

811
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.040
Can you imagine?
Can you just imagine?

812
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.160
And I can see how that would have
been absolutely infuriating for him.

813
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.200
because. as far as I can tell.

814
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.560
almost every show idea

815
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.760
was inspired by something
he had seen or experienced.

816
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.320
or a particular technical
fascination that he had.

817
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.920
I mean. obviously any show
is a huge collaborative effort.

818
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.080
and some of those contributors will
have more influence than others.

819
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.120
but it's all got to start somewhere.

820
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.720
One of his great strengths
was seeing the value of people

821
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.920
and being able to promote them.
or give them opportunities.

822
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.520
which then fed into
the Gerry Anderson ethos

823
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.920
of making the best possible
production.

824
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.520
He was always keen on collaboration.
and he thrived on it.

825
00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.080
but I think if someone were to try
and take credit for his work.

826
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.280
it would have just been too much
for him to bear.

827
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.640
I think that most people
who are knowledgeable.

828
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.400
and who are aware of the product.

829
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.600
are aware of Sylvia's contribution.

830
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.240
I do the characterisation.

831
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.120
Gerry was an expert at what he did.

832
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.160
and she was an expert
at what she did.

833
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.200
She provided many human touches.
in costume and characterisation.

834
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.240
in little touches of humour

835
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.680
which might not have been
there otherwise.

836
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.960
Her contribution
was pretty terrific.

837
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.800
And the two of them combined was
a double whammy you couldn't stop.

838
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.960
But unfortunately. life.
as it sometimes tends to do.

839
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.120
gets in the way.
and gets up to its tricks.

840
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.560
And it didn't work out.

841
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.600
She was very talented.

842
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.920
but she was very determined
about what she wanted.

843
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.240
She was very media savvy.

844
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.360
She was a very.
very attractive woman.

845
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.720
And she could be very. very nice.

846
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.280
When they had the premiere
for Thunderbirds.

847
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.520
she had a dress made for me.
and it was absolutely beautiful.

848
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.080
I feel that I was really
playing dressing up. really.

849
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.200
It was playing with my dolls.
really.

850
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.400
She had a way of getting round me.
if she wanted to.

851
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.480
And she came into my room one day
and said. very sweet about it.

852
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.680
"Gerry. can I please. please. please
play Lady Penelope?"

853
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.640
I may not get another chance.
Please.

854
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.320
And I said. "Well. no".
because I wanted...

855
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.400
Fenella Fielding. was it?
I wanted her to play the part.

856
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.360
And very often.
when I disagreed with her.

857
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.400
life became very miserable
as a result.

858
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.160
And when we had
these sort of terrible rows.

859
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.200
she then had the capacity
to maybe hold a hand out.

860
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.400
and we'd go to bed.
and it would all be marvellous.

861
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.840
Eventually. I said OK.

862
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.960
OK. Penny.

863
00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.560
He felt like.
"I've already made one mistake.

864
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.600
"I don't want to make another one."

865
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.640
So I think his relationship
with Sylvia

866
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.080
became one of constantly doing
whatever was necessary

867
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.040
to keep her happy.

868
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.000
To keep her smiling.

869
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.520
To help her further her career.

870
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.120
And that was to his. I think.
personal detriment.

871
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.880
and. eventually.
his professional detriment as well.

872
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.120
But she was a tough cookie.

873
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.760
She was so good as the character.
I forgive her everything.

874
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.800
With the marriage falling apart.

875
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.480
certainly from Dad's point of view.
anyway. in the mid-'60s.

876
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.840
Sylvia broke the news to Dad
that she was pregnant.

877
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.720
My immediate reaction was one of.
"Oh. God. I'm trapped."

878
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.480
As I already was feeling that
"I've had enough of this."

879
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.600
It's a boy!

880
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.520
But once Gerry Jr arrived.

881
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.560
I think he suddenly
found a connection.

882
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.920
He was desperate to make up for
any failures he'd made as a father

883
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.640
during his previous marriage.

884
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.160
In terms of his parenting.
Dad was. of course. a workaholic.

885
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.200
so he wasn't around that much.

886
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.600
But it would be unfair to say
that he didn't care.

887
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.120
He just showed it in unusual ways.

888
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.080
Like constantly worrying about
his kids coming to physical harm.

889
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.360
I think maybe it's a throwback

890
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.360
to Lionel's death
while he was away from home.

891
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.400
and the pain it inflicted
on his parents.

892
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.680
And I think it meant
that he was always concerned

893
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.680
that some harm may come to his
children if they were away from him.

894
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.360
I went to him and I said.

895
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.880
"We're going to France."

896
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.080
And he just put the boot in

897
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.320
and started coming out
with all this.

898
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.240
"Well. what if the plane door
comes open?"

899
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.080
I said. "Well.
we'll be sucked out. won't we?"

900
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.360
And those fears and anxieties
were often manifested on screen.

901
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.040
like in UFO.

902
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.960
Dad!

903
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.760
HORN BLARES. TYRES SCREECH

904
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.800
Johnny!

905
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.200
And the lead character. Ed Straker.

906
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.760
is the head of a studio
with his marriage collapsing.

907
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.880
It's Dad's art imitating Dad's life.

908
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.000
It was fine
when we were all struggling.

909
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.040
but once we got there. erm.

910
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.840
there seemed to be nothing keeping
us together. really. No glue.

911
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.520
And finally.

912
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.840
you know.
there was total enmity between them.

913
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.120
But the enmity at the end
between Gerry and Sylvia

914
00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.200
was vituperative or intense.

915
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.400
The whole crew knew
that it was going rotten.

916
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.320
and it was an unhappy time
for everybody.

917
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.600
At the end of every feature film
or television series.

918
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.080
there is an end-of-shooting party.

919
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.600
And things were so bad
with Sylvia and myself

920
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.360
that when we got home. I said.

921
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.720
"Look. if you want to go
to the party. that's fine.

922
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.640
"but if you're gonna go. I'm not."

923
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.280
And she said. "No. I'm not going.
I don't want to go.

924
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.200
"I'm not gonna spoil your evening."

925
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.000
And I said. "OK. fine."
And I went to the party.

926
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.840
It was all very nice.
and everyone was jolly.

927
00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.480
and we were all drinking and happy.

928
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.440
and then she made her appearance.
She came in.

929
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.280
And I went over and said.
"I thought you weren't coming?"

930
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.320
And she said. "Why. is there a law

931
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.640
"that I can't come
to Pinewood Studios?"

932
00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.240
And I got very. very steamed up.
You know. very hurt.

933
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.400
And when the party was over.

934
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.000
there was somebody who I knew very.
very well. David Withers -

935
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.720
he was a fairly important
member of ITC -

936
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.360
and Sylvia said. "We're going home.
Dave. do you wanna come with us?"

937
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.320
I was seething.
Last thing I wanted to do

938
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.320
was have to pretend
in front of people.

939
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.880
Cos I knew as soon as we got home.
there'd be a blazing row.

940
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.680
So he said. "Oh. lovely."
So he came back.

941
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.160
So there's Dave. Sylvia and myself.

942
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.600
And we were bickering.

943
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.800
And the argument
became quite intense.

944
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.600
You know. a really nasty.
nasty scene.

945
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.160
And Dave. who I'd known for years.

946
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.040
and I never knew
that he played the piano.

947
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.360
And he went over
and he lifted the piano.

948
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.240
and he started to play scales.
Wonderful.

949
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.920
OK. Gerry. Keep it going.

950
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.360
PIANO PLAYING. GUNFIRE

951
00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.320
And at the end of the argument.
I said.

952
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.280
"That's it. I've had enough.

953
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.800
"I'm not having any more.
I'm leaving."

954
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.560
That's when it was over.

955
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.000
Dad wanted to proceed
with a divorce.

956
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.320
The divorce case. and then
the custody case for Gerry Jr.

957
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.520
went on for. I think.
six or seven years from that point.

958
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.440
The break-up of the marriage
was costing dearly.

959
00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.320
and I think the understanding was.
I got from Gerry.

960
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.840
that he virtually
used all of his savings

961
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.160
to try and get access to Gerry Jr.

962
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.280
But when I left Sylvia. I said.

963
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.000
"Look. we divide everything
exactly in half." Which we did.

964
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.400
She did her thing.
and I did my thing.

965
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.400
I bought my flat outright.

966
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.880
I did it up beautifully.
cos I know I'm gonna be a bachelor.

967
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.280
And then the trouble started
with Gerry.

968
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.680
A legal battle
to try and see my son.

969
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.880
From being a very successful person.

970
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.760
his life. I think.
took a very serious downturn.

971
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.280
and he really financially struggled.

972
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.920
and lost a lot of the wealth
that he had gained.

973
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.720
What happened was.
for however many years.

974
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.480
I was in and out of court.

975
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.560
barristers. affidavits.
God knows what.

976
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.560
and she used every trick in
the trade to prevent me seeing him.

977
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.600
Cos I remember him once saying.

978
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.960
"David. if she came into this room.
I'd hit her."

979
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.040
He was distraught.

980
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.080
because he'd sort of lost touch

981
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.280
with his two daughters
from his first marriage.

982
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.960
and he couldn't bear the thought
of losing a third child.

983
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.480
especially a son.

984
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.280
but Gerry was the apple of his eye.
so...

985
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.280
He told me that
they were going to court

986
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.720
in the discussion
of the divorce proceedings.

987
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.480
and Gerry had turned up there
with his lawyer.

988
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.680
and he obviously had money still
to be able to afford his lawyer.

989
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.920
and was there in a suit.
and very presentable.

990
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.560
And Sylvia turned up in rags.

991
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.680
I don't ever remember seeing Sylvia
in old clothes.

992
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.800
She was always immaculate.

993
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.920
She was. erm.

994
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.920
dishevelled. I think
is the word that Gerry used.

995
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.960
Appealing on the court

996
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.120
so that they would award her
whatever the final award was.

997
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.600
He was outwitted by a smarter brain
when it came to that sort of thing.

998
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:26.080
I think the one thing that
I wasn't able to forgive her for

999
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.960
was that she made sure that he
didn't see his other son again.

1000
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.280
This has been a long and tiring case
for all concerned.

1001
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.080
Finally. I got a letter from
the court. I had won the case.

1002
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.240
Lay it out.
I would see him every other weekend.

1003
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.880
two weeks' holiday a year.

1004
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.840
So I then phoned Sylvia and said.

1005
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.280
"I would like to see Gerry
this weekend."

1006
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.560
"Of course."

1007
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.920
I said. "Oh. good.
I'll come and pick him up."

1008
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.000
"No. no. no.
I'll deliver him to you."

1009
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.040
"Thank you."

1010
00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.280
I woke up Saturday morning. because
there was a noise on the letterbox.

1011
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.000
and I thought it was the postman.

1012
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.800
When I went to the front door.
there was a letter.

1013
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.160
Let's hope it's good news.

1014
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.960
And it was from Gerry.
basically saying.

1015
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.360
"Dear Dad. I don't want to see you.
I don't ever want to see you again."

1016
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.320
When I met him for the first time.
after all these years.

1017
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.120
he phoned me out of the blue.
and we met in a hotel.

1018
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.960
like on neutral ground.

1019
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.440
and he came in and said.
"Oh. hello". and he sat down.

1020
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.040
and almost the first thing he said
was.

1021
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.160
"You realise
I didn't write that letter?

1022
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.680
"I was made to write it."

1023
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.240
It was almost the first thing
he said.

1024
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.840
Sadly.
after their brief reconciliation.

1025
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.880
the relationship broke down.

1026
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.440
and Dad didn't see Gerry Jr again.

1027
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.160
People go out of their way to say.
"Of course I'm not bitter.

1028
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.360
"This man came in and blew my
mother's head off with a shotgun.

1029
00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.160
"but I'm not bitter." You know?

1030
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.960
I'm bloody bitter!

1031
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.400
Yes. I am bitter.

1032
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.560
And I don't try to cover it.
You know. I think it was terrible.

1033
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.160
And I think the truth is. I hate her
more every day that goes by.

1034
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.720
Nothing gets better.
Nothing heals.

1035
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.360
He was very vulnerable.
Very gullible.

1036
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.160
And totally lost.

1037
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.600
Yeah. he was pretty well drained
of money.

1038
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.800
From the point when Lew
had agreed to fund Supercar.

1039
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.840
Lew had always backed Dad.
for every project.

1040
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.000
In fact. he famously got cross
with Dad

1041
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.760
when Dad wasn't certain that
Lew would like an upcoming idea.

1042
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.240
Which turned out to be.
I think. Thunderbirds.

1043
00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.560
And Lew said to Dad...

1044
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.000
"Gerry. if you want to make a series
about that light bulb.

1045
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.080
"I'll back it."

1046
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.800
By the mid-late 1970s.

1047
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.480
ATV. which had then become ITC.

1048
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.240
was a lot more corporate.
It had got bigger.

1049
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.640
America was involved.

1050
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.760
and Lew was beginning
to lose his grip of ATV.

1051
00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.640
He was no longer the man
who could just say.

1052
00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.680
"Yeah. let's make it.
I'll find the money."

1053
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.080
Suddenly. he was under scrutiny
from other people within ATV.

1054
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.920
Well. the president of Lew's
company in New York phoned and said.

1055
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.760
"Lew. cancel the renewal."

1056
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.280
And I think that meant that Lew

1057
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.840
could no longer be the yes-man
that he always had been.

1058
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.200
I think he could see disaster
coming down the tracks.

1059
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.640
And then that left Dad
without a solid backer.

1060
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.200
Looks like I'm on my own.

1061
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.920
Once Space: 1999 finished.
there was no work.

1062
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:35.200
If this is the end of one life.
we have to start to build a new one.

1063
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.760
In my biography.
the dedication reads.

1064
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.040
"To Mary. who saved my life."

1065
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.080
And that's absolutely true.

1066
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.600
She was a gentle soul.

1067
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.200
She was nice.

1068
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.320
She wasn't assertive. or aggressive.

1069
00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.720
or someone who's always got to win.

1070
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.120
She didn't get caught up
in his drama.

1071
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.480
It's not uncommon for people
to refer to their wives

1072
00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.560
as their better halves.
and Gerry. I think.

1073
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.120
lucked out with Mary.

1074
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.960
She was his better half.
in many respects.

1075
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.520
We used to go to a pub in Cookham.

1076
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.840
It was a pub where Arthur.
the waiter.

1077
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.320
contributed his voice to Parker.

1078
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.880
And there was a very sophisticated
girl standing there.

1079
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.520
and I suppose. if the truth
were to be known.

1080
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.240
I used to look at her

1081
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.120
and have thoughts
that I can't repeat on camera.

1082
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.160
But some years later.
I was sitting there.

1083
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.400
I'd left Sylvia now.

1084
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.560
and I was very lonely.

1085
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.800
and a very attractive girl
came around

1086
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.600
with a big silver tray of drinks.

1087
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.480
And then I said to somebody.
"Who is the girl?"

1088
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.400
And they said. "Don't be daft.

1089
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.680
"she's the girl who used to work
at The King's Arms."

1090
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.120
I think he was just finishing
the first series of Space: 1999.

1091
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.200
And I was working at Bray
for Brian Johnson

1092
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.360
on the special effects unit.

1093
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.160
I've never been very good
with women.

1094
00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.880
so I kind of went home and rehearsed
how I was going to ring her.

1095
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.040
and I made up some cock and bull
story and invited her over.

1096
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.840
and that's how it all began.

1097
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.160
He had got into a position. I think.
where he thought. after Sylvia.

1098
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.760
he would never get married again.

1099
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.000
You don't marry the person
you want to live with.

1100
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.160
You marry the person
you can't live without.

1101
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.720
But Mum appears to have been
the right person to change his mind.

1102
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.520
When he learned that
I was expecting. he was surprised.

1103
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.240
A baby! Ooh!

1104
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.800
I was horrified.

1105
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.360
I mean. you know. "I'll be dead
before the child's grown up."

1106
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.520
And she was very philosophical
about it. and she talked me into it.

1107
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.560
And suddenly I had a family again.

1108
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.200
And everything returned to normal.
everything was repaired.

1109
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.720
and life is great once more.

1110
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.680
That was when Gerry
was really happy. I think.

1111
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.280
'Turn around.'

1112
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.680
'Don't come any closer.'

1113
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.720
I think Mary grounded him.

1114
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.640
And one thing for sure I can say

1115
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.240
is that Mary didn't marry me
for my money.

1116
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.520
As a matter of fact. she used to
go out to work and earn money

1117
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.200
while I was at home
wearing an overcoat

1118
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.400
because the flat was so cold

1119
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.120
and we couldn't afford to put
the heating on. writing a script.

1120
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.920
and then she would spend
the whole evening

1121
00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.000
typing it out and putting it
into good English.

1122
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.240
And I think that was around the time
the bailiffs had been in

1123
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.600
and confiscated some paintings.

1124
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.440
It really shows
you've hit rock bottom

1125
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.400
when the bailiffs come in.

1126
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.400
And it wasn't until. I think.
we met Christopher Burr

1127
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.240
that life started to look
a little bit better.

1128
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.320
Christopher Burr was a very.
very complex character.

1129
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.960
Very. very complicated.

1130
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.320
An utterly brilliant businessman.

1131
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.840
He. after several trips to Japan.

1132
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.880
got the money together
for Terrahawks.

1133
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.320
He's a miracle man.
An absolute miracle man.

1134
00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.320
So he raised the money for the show.
But it wasn't nearly enough.

1135
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.560
And I was desperate to make it.

1136
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.880
And it was the first stepping stone
to my recovery.

1137
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.240
They weren't besties.

1138
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.120
but they worked well together.

1139
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.040
And then. as people do.

1140
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.680
Christopher suddenly. I think.

1141
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.320
got a bit bored
with the film business.

1142
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.960
I think what brought it to an end

1143
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.960
was that Christopher bought himself
a lovely house in Portugal.

1144
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.560
and he fell in love with Portugal.

1145
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.600
And he started to play golf.

1146
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.160
And finally. I said to him.
"I don't think we can go on."

1147
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.720
And we decided to part company
amicably.

1148
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.080
They didn't really talk again.
because Gerry had this thing

1149
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.960
of once people were out of his life.
they were out.

1150
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.040
Relationships
don't come about easily.

1151
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.560
Gerry wasn't above demonising people
in his shows.

1152
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.280
I was aware of Roger Lefkon.

1153
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:56.320
who was part of the funding package
for Space Precinct.

1154
00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.240
I heard that there were funding
problems on Space Precinct.

1155
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.240
I heard Roger's name was associated
with those funding problems.

1156
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.800
And so Dad was adamant

1157
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.960
that when they made
new Captain Scarlet in 2005.

1158
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:14.200
that the baddie. Captain Black.
be given the surname Lefkon.

1159
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.680
The only thing we're both certain
of is Conrad Lefkon died on Mars.

1160
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.000
The Mysterons killed him.

1161
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.920
And then. of course.
there is Zelda in Terrahawks.

1162
00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.880
Be quiet. you snivelling wretch!

1163
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:31.040
Richard Gregory had told me that
he was given loose instruction

1164
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.440
to push the character
in a particular direction.

1165
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.960
which made it look
not unlike Sylvia.

1166
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.520
And being the evil character.
evil demon in the show.

1167
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.520
it was obviously a loaded sculpt.

1168
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.000
I can leave it up to
viewers of Terrahawks

1169
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.920
to decide whether they think
that's true or not.

1170
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.200
I think that had Gerry

1171
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.440
kept all his contacts and friends

1172
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.000
as he moved up through
his various series.

1173
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.040
he would have probably done
a lot better in later years.

1174
01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.400
To me. a relationship
is the only thing that counts.

1175
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.120
And I remember he said to me.

1176
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.240
"Oh. John.
I wish I'd seen more of you.

1177
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.520
"When I was busy.
I was asked to lunch and everything.

1178
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.480
"Soon as I haven't any work.
nobody wants to know."

1179
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.000
Everybody who had a friendship
with Gerry formerly

1180
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.160
was somebody who was useful to him.
I think.

1181
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.520
He found it very hard
to make friends.

1182
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.320
and I think he just.
maybe in the earlier days.

1183
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.440
didn't see the value of maintaining
good relationships with people.

1184
01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.520
If you look at Gerry's history
with producers.

1185
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.800
there's a long list of producers
who worked with him.

1186
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.160
You have failed.
and must pay the price.

1187
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.040
He had a thin skin. I think. Gerry.

1188
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.400
As with Oscar Wilde.

1189
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.680
there was a thing called
The Gentle Art Of Making Enemies.

1190
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.960
My temperament is like
riding a roller-coaster.

1191
01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.280
I don't think I'm the only one
who'll say

1192
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.240
that if he took against somebody.

1193
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.800
then there'd be fireworks.
He wouldn't work with them again.

1194
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.840
I remember when we were making
a commercial for Toilet Duck.

1195
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.400
It was always difficult
working with clients from abroad.

1196
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.880
and certainly. our clients
didn't have very good English.

1197
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.520
And Gerry would always
check with them and say.

1198
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.160
"This is the set up. have a look
through the camera. are you happy?"

1199
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.920
"Yeah. yeah. everybody's happy."

1200
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.600
And so we probably spent
two or three hours doing the setup.

1201
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.160
We were running behind because it
was such a complicated shot to get.

1202
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.120
And eventually. we did get the shot.
and Gerry was happy.

1203
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.400
and he turned around to the
advertising agency representatives

1204
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.080
and said. "Are you happy?"

1205
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.960
And they went.
"Yeah. yeah. we're happy."

1206
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.960
"Are you sure?"
"Yeah. yeah."

1207
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.800
And so we started to strike the set.

1208
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.960
and then one of them turned around
and said. "Oh. could we just...?"

1209
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.680
And Gerry just went
absolutely ballistic.

1210
01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.760
and screamed and shouted
and whatever.

1211
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.440
No bad language. but...

1212
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.360
I'm not afraid to say what I think.

1213
01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.400
I'm not afraid of
going into a blazing row.

1214
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.000
If that's what it takes
to get the bitter out. I'll do it.

1215
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.360
I think if Gerry thought he was
being creatively trodden upon.

1216
01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.600
then that would be enough.
on occasion. to.

1217
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.480
if he didn't like you.
to put you on the back burner.

1218
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.240
I think we all know

1219
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.560
when a relationship
starts to come to an end.

1220
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.600
As Captain Scarlet finished.
Gerry and I's working relationship

1221
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.120
wasn't as good as it had been.

1222
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.280
I actually called Gerry
and said to him.

1223
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.120
"Listen. Gerry. I think this is
a really disappointing situation.

1224
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.160
"I don't want it to end like this.

1225
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.280
"and I'd just like
if we could maintain a friendship."

1226
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.240
And Gerry very kindly said.
"Come up for lunch."

1227
01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.240
But he was a different Gerry.

1228
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.960
He'd made his decision.

1229
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.000
and I wasn't gonna be a part
of any future productions.

1230
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.400
It didn't matter to him
that I wasn't a friend any more.

1231
01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.000
Towards the end of his life.
I think that was more likely

1232
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.680
because of his dementia kicking in.

1233
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.400
It's beyond my comprehension.
the thought of retiring.

1234
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.120
not unless some ill health
forces it.

1235
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.520
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

1236
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.760
None of us on the production
knew that he wasn't very well.

1237
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.280
Looking back on it.
there were clear and obvious signs.

1238
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.960
I recall around 2003.

1239
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960
so long before
there was any diagnosis.

1240
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.440
or any real sign
that there was something wrong.

1241
01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.240
He would forget appointments.

1242
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.880
or get them muddled.
he'd get them on the wrong day.

1243
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.560
His driving became erratic.

1244
01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.600
Dad had come into London to
pick me and a friend up from Fulham

1245
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.280
and drive us back home.

1246
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.760
And we were driving out on the M4.

1247
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.360
and my friend Jack
nudged me in the ribs

1248
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.840
and looked down
at the side of the car.

1249
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.800
and I looked down.

1250
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.400
and his lane placement
was really weird.

1251
01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.920
he was sort of...

1252
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.840
Not even drifting. but just the car

1253
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.080
was placed slightly over
the white lines. out of the lane.

1254
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.760
He was a really good driver.

1255
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.680
He was a fast driver.
but he had really good reflexes.

1256
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.200
I mean.
I think he really enjoyed driving.

1257
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.560
And at the time. I just thought.
"Oh. he's distracted". or whatever.

1258
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.520
Looking at his GPS monitor. or
thinking about something else. or...

1259
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:26.320
But that was the start of us seeing
changes in his driving ability.

1260
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.840
changes in his spatial awareness.

1261
01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.120
By early 2004.

1262
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.120
I was seeing more strange moments
in his driving.

1263
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.440
Entering roundabouts
in the wrong lane.

1264
01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.200
having little. tiny accidents.
moments.

1265
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.600
just where he would
sort of scrape his car.

1266
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.680
little things that. at the time.
you think. "Oh. he's being clumsy".

1267
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.440
but it all added up to
starting to look a bit strange.

1268
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.640
And within a year of that.

1269
01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.800
he was starting to have
real problems driving.

1270
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.080
Again. which. at the time...

1271
01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.680
It seems ridiculous now.
but you brush them off.

1272
01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.920
and you say. "Oh. he's stressed".
or. "He's tired."

1273
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.760
He would get lost on a simple
journey between home and Pinewood.

1274
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.520
Which. you know.
was his second home.

1275
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.720
He'd been coming to Pinewood
for probably 50 years by that point.

1276
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.960
So. one time he came to Pinewood
to have lunch with me.

1277
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.800
and he'd got back into his car
and taken four hours to get home.

1278
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.560
I was about to call the police
to report him missing.

1279
01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.200
And you would think. at that point.
that your natural response would be.

1280
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.560
"OK. we've got to get this
checked out". but even then...

1281
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.920
Because he was so insistent
that he was absolutely fine.

1282
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.480
and there was no problem.

1283
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.120
you would just sort of go. "Oh. OK.
we'll agree with you. in that case."

1284
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.960
I can't remember the exact incident
that catalysed me into action.

1285
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.000
But I think I remember watching
a documentary about Terry Pratchett.

1286
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.320
who had recently been diagnosed

1287
01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.800
with a very specific
form of dementia called PCA.

1288
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.080
And in that documentary.

1289
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.920
I think Terry talked about confusing
the phone for the TV remote.

1290
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.800
And I thought.
"I've seen Dad do that."

1291
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.880
I rung him.
and every time I rung him.

1292
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.360
he picked up the phone
and he said. "Hello."

1293
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.480
and I said.
"Hello. Daddy. it's Joy."

1294
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.360
And he put the phone down.

1295
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.240
And I thought.
"That's really strange.

1296
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.640
"I don't think we've had
an argument or anything."

1297
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.880
So I tried again and again.
and every time. it was the same.

1298
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.200
So I just stopped ringing.

1299
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.040
I just thought. "I think we've
got to do something about this."

1300
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.480
And so I suggested
that I go and speak to Dad's GP.

1301
01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.920
and I would explain to her that
I was worried about his behaviour

1302
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.040
and I thought there was something
going on. maybe dementia-related.

1303
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.520
and that could she approach this
very delicately?

1304
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.480
She couldn't possibly tell him
that I'd been in to see her.

1305
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.360
because he'd be really upset
by that. and she assured me

1306
01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.720
she would handle it
professionally and carefully.

1307
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.880
I explained this all
very. very carefully.

1308
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.600
and she agreed a course of action.

1309
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.720
Dad was due in
for a diabetes screening.

1310
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.320
because he lived with diabetes
for a long time.

1311
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.560
and he went in to see her
for his appointment. sat down.

1312
01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.360
and the first thing she said was.

1313
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.240
"Mr Anderson.
your son's been to see me.

1314
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.040
"and he thinks there's
something wrong with your brain."

1315
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.880
He just hit the roof.

1316
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.400
I mean. to him.

1317
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.400
this was the ultimate act
of disloyalty against him.

1318
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.880
He said. in a moment. "I understand
why you did what you did.

1319
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.960
"but what you've done is
the kiss of death for my career."

1320
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.240
I don't think he would speak to me
for about two weeks.

1321
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.720
Anyway. he eventually agreed
to having a few more tests.

1322
01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.600
and a dementia diagnosis
was confirmed.

1323
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.120
There is a particular drawing
that one does

1324
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.160
as part of a neuropsychological
battery of testing.

1325
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.120
which is to draw a clock face.

1326
01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.960
And to draw a particular time on it.

1327
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.360
And I think that was the thing
that made him realise

1328
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.560
that he was actually
living with Alzheimer's disease.

1329
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.200
It's deeply unpleasant for
the person living with dementia.

1330
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.720
but one could argue it's even worse
for those around them.

1331
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.760
Sometimes I had to phone Jamie
and say.

1332
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.680
"If you don't come home
and have your father for half a day.

1333
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.480
"I'm gonna knife him."
I mean. it was that bad.

1334
01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.240
And anybody who's lived with
somebody with dementia

1335
01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.400
will tell you the same thing.

1336
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.040
It changes the way you think.

1337
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.360
It changes the way you act
towards people you know and love.

1338
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.360
And Dad would often lash out

1339
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.040
and say extremely hurtful
and unpleasant things.

1340
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.360
It was very tough.
I mean. any carer will tell you.

1341
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.880
because you do slip
into the role of carer.

1342
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.840
and you become. at best. grey.
at worst. invisible.

1343
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.720
There's little assistance.

1344
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.360
I tried several times
to get somebody to come in

1345
01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.400
to sit with him.
or maybe take him out.

1346
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.520
and he didn't like them.
didn't want them.

1347
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.680
I mean. she did an incredible job.

1348
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.600
She was his 24/7 carer
for over two years.

1349
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.960
There was a point at which
he had accepted the diagnosis.

1350
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.800
and...

1351
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.320
we were sat chatting.
and he said. "Well. I don't know.

1352
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.520
"I don't see what the point
of having a diagnosis is.

1353
01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.560
"because what are they gonna do?"

1354
01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.760
And I... I just chanced it and said.

1355
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.720
"The other thing you could do
now that you've got a diagnosis

1356
01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.200
"is you could try
and maybe raise awareness about it.

1357
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.760
"You could talk publicly about it.
and it might do some good."

1358
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.920
And I thought.
"There's no way he's gonna do this.

1359
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.480
"because he's already complaining
about the fact

1360
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.920
"that it's ended his career".

1361
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.160
and coming out about
having Alzheimer's disease

1362
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.240
was absolutely the last nail
in the coffin for his career.

1363
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.680
But he. remarkably. said.

1364
01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.480
"Hmm. I think I'd like to have
a chat with somebody about that."

1365
01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.480
One day. I got a call. I think it
was about spring. 2012. from Jamie.

1366
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.720
introducing himself. and saying
who he was. and who his father was.

1367
01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.000
Gerry himself was very aware

1368
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.760
that. being a figure
in the public realm.

1369
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.800
that once he'd made a formal
announcement about his dementia.

1370
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.280
that could be
a positive force for good.

1371
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.760
It was fairly unusual
to get a call like that.

1372
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.680
of someone of that calibre.
and that worldwide recognition.

1373
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.600
to want to do something for others.

1374
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.720
And I particularly found it very
heart-warming. and very humbling.

1375
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.440
After having chats with Jamie
and the family.

1376
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.680
we decided that Gerry
could really support us

1377
01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.840
in promoting one of our campaigns.

1378
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.040
which is an ongoing campaign
called Memory Walk.

1379
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.800
He agreed to start
the Alzheimer's Society Memory Walk

1380
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.000
at Battersea. in London.
It's their flagship event.

1381
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.520
And he was starting it
alongside Carey Mulligan

1382
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.680
and Mat Whitecross. the director.

1383
01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.720
And the morning of.
I was staying at home.

1384
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.680
and it was supposed to be me driving
him up to London for this event.

1385
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.640
and I think it was
the last public event that he did.

1386
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.920
because he was deteriorating
so fast.

1387
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.240
And I went upstairs.
and I opened the door.

1388
01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.000
and he was still in bed.
and he stared at me and said.

1389
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.880
"What are you doing in here...
after what you've done?!"

1390
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.840
And I said. "What have I done. Dad?
What's happened?"

1391
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.080
And he said. "You've moved the door.

1392
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.160
"I could have fallen down the stairs
because you've moved the door."

1393
01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.440
And then he said.
"And who sent those children up?"

1394
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.600
"What children?"

1395
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.680
"There were children
dancing around my bed. singing."

1396
01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.440
And it's only been quite recently.

1397
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.600
when we've been looking back
at his life.

1398
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.880
that it suddenly occurred to me
that that was a relived memory

1399
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.400
of one of the strongest
recollections he had

1400
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.360
of his experience of anti-Semitism.

1401
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.560
Which was a bunch of kids
dancing around him.

1402
01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.480
taunting him at school.
calling him "Jew boy."

1403
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.920
And knowing how bad he'd been.
I thought.

1404
01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.080
"There's no way he's gonna be
able to do this start."

1405
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080
Because he's got to make a speech.

1406
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.400
When he arrived.
he was actually on great form.

1407
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.320
He had a lot of... There was
a lot of love in the crowd.

1408
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.200
There was over 1.000 people there.
I think 2.000 people there.

1409
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.560
And loads of them. of course.
were Thunderbirds fans.

1410
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.120
so they were delighted
to see Gerry there.

1411
01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.880
And he responded so well to that.

1412
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.480
He kind of shone in the spotlight.

1413
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.520
He gave a five-minute
hilarious speech.

1414
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.880
The public perception of dementia
changed hugely

1415
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.200
thanks to Gerry Anderson's
involvement.

1416
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.960
I think that Memory Walk.
or that year's Memory Walk.

1417
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.800
raised over £1 million
for Alzheimer's Society.

1418
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.200
Which they have directly attributed
to him.

1419
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.360
It made me really proud. actually.

1420
01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.080
because he was such a private man.
who got so easily embarrassed.

1421
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.760
I felt very forgiving. actually.

1422
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.160
I just thought.
"Well. good on you. Dad.

1423
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.320
"that you've been prepared
to do this."

1424
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.120
Because. in a sense.
for somebody like him.

1425
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.600
losing control was like
the ultimate humiliation.

1426
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.960
When he was in quite late stages
of Alzheimer's disease.

1427
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.400
I realised
he was forgetting my name.

1428
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.520
And I would say.
"Hello. Dad. it's Jamie."

1429
01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.400
And the recognition of that.
and the meaning of that was fading.

1430
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.160
And then. one day. I was...

1431
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.480
I think. actually.
we were doing an interview

1432
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.440
for a morning programme.
about Alzheimer's disease.

1433
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.880
and he said to the crew.

1434
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.600
"Well. if you need anything.
my big brother's over there."

1435
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.480
And he pointed at me.

1436
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.440
And... At the time. I just thought.

1437
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.040
"Oh. this is a moment of confusion.
and he'll get over it."

1438
01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.120
But from that moment forward.

1439
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.000
he only referred to me
as his big brother.

1440
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.920
I actually felt quite touched
by that.

1441
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.120
I said to Jamie.
"That's a real compliment.

1442
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.360
"because. you know.
if he's mixing you up with Lionel.

1443
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.640
"Lionel was very. very special.

1444
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.800
"so he knows you're very special.

1445
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.360
"even if he can't
get your name right."

1446
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.200
From the time that Dad
got his diagnosis. he always said.

1447
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.960
"The moment I am not safe at home.
I want to go into care."

1448
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.520
He had more and more hallucinations
about the space he was living in.

1449
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.120
and he got more and more confused
about where he could go.

1450
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.960
And it was getting to the point
when we thought. "He is days away

1451
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.480
"from potentially stepping out
across the top step

1452
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.000
"and falling down the stairs."

1453
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.440
So Mum and I agreed that it was time
that he needed to go into care.

1454
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.760
Because. you know. she and I
were both at home full time.

1455
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.440
and we couldn't cope
and give him everything he needed

1456
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.760
to keep him safe and well.

1457
01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.640
It was horrendous. because he didn't
really understand what was going on.

1458
01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.840
So we took him up to the room.

1459
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.880
took all of his stuff up there.
got him settled.

1460
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.080
and he just kept saying.
"Well. I'm not staying here. am I?"

1461
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.680
There was a real sense
of separation anxiety.

1462
01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.840
And. er...
He came to the door of the room.

1463
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840
and the nurse was outside.

1464
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.760
and she said. "Hello. Mr Anderson.
how are you settling in?"

1465
01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.120
And he sort of looked at her

1466
01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.560
and said. "I'm not settling in.
I'm not staying."

1467
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.000
And she said. "Well. would
you like to meet your neighbour?"

1468
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.920
I said. "That'll be nice. Dad.
let's meet your neighbour."

1469
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.520
An elderly lady came to the door.
and the nurse said.

1470
01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.680
"Mr Anderson.
this is your neighbour.

1471
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.080
"Her name's Sylvia."

1472
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.880
And even now. saying it.

1473
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.880
I can feel my heart leaping into
my mouth. because I just thought.

1474
01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.200
"This is terrible. this could not be
worse. How is he gonna react?"

1475
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.760
And sort of everything
went in slow motion.

1476
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.440
and after a couple of seconds.
he reached out and said.

1477
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.480
"Oh. hello. nice to meet you."
and shook her hand.

1478
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.120
And it was in that moment
that I knew for sure

1479
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.760
that he was no longer Dad. really.

1480
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.520
And they say to you.
"Don't come and visit for ten days.

1481
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.160
"Let the...
Let the person settle in."

1482
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.720
You go back after ten days.

1483
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.760
and the person
doesn't know you any more.

1484
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.680
It wasn't just Mum
that he'd forgotten by that stage.

1485
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.320
He couldn't remember
any of the shows that he'd made.

1486
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.800
Not one.

1487
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.520
And he'd been given
a Parker puppet by a fan

1488
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.880
that I took to the care home
to try and comfort him. but...

1489
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.600
Even that meant nothing to him.

1490
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.360
We had a. er...
We had Christmas Day at Mum's.

1491
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.240
And he had really declined
very. very quickly

1492
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.480
once he'd gone into the home.
I mean...

1493
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.960
You know. memories of
where was home and who was Mary.

1494
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.600
All these things had gone.

1495
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.400
Erm. they thought that we had
maybe four or five days to go.

1496
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.280
Because I knew
that the end was coming.

1497
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.520
I decided that on Boxing Day morning
that I would drive home.

1498
01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.160
get a load of overnight stuff

1499
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.240
and then come back
and live at Mum's. because...

1500
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.000
I wanted to be around.

1501
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.320
So. we were driving...

1502
01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.400
Erm...

1503
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.040
And my phone rang.
And I thought. "Oh. no."

1504
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.320
So I pulled over and answered it.

1505
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.360
And that was the home.
to say that he'd passed away.

1506
01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.720
Erm...

1507
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.840
It was about two hours
before I would've gone back.

1508
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.320
When we knew what he knew.
that he didn't have that long to go.

1509
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.760
I said. "Now.
we need to talk about funeral."

1510
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.920
"We'll do something nice and small.
and..."

1511
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.320
"I don't want a small funeral!

1512
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.520
"I want a huge funeral!"

1513
01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.720
So that's what he had.
SHE CHUCKLES

1514
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.960
Dying on Boxing Day...

1515
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.880
er. was. was great for that.

1516
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.720
So. he got a huge amount
of news coverage.

1517
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.560
and all the way through.
I was just thinking.

1518
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.960
"God. he really timed this well.

1519
01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.320
"because this is exactly
what he would've wanted."

1520
01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.040
And so much positivity.
You know. people...

1521
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.120
People tweeting me
and tweeting stuff about him.

1522
01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.720
and. you know.
I think somebody tweeted

1523
01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.040
that a light had gone out
in the universe.

1524
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.880
People saying. erm...

1525
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.280
"You made my childhood
very special."

1526
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.280
Which was very gratifying.

1527
01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.560
What else do you do
for Gerry Anderson's funeral.

1528
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.360
other than get
a life-size FAB 1 pink Rolls-Royce

1529
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.280
to pull up at the funeral?

1530
01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.680
His funeral was amazing.

1531
01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.360
People came from all over the place.
Came from all over the world.

1532
01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.440
We managed to get all the kids
together in the same place.

1533
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.600
They all came to the funeral.
It brought us all together.

1534
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.640
And. er. I was really chuffed

1535
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.280
that Gerry Jr
agreed to be a pallbearer.

1536
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.680
And then we had
a sort of get-together.

1537
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.520
and actually. it was quite strange.
especially reflecting on it now.

1538
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.920
just how many people there were.

1539
01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.800
As we've discovered.
he did not necessarily maintain

1540
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.320
personal professional relationships
that well.

1541
01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.400
and yet. hundreds and hundreds
of people turned up.

1542
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.000
As part of his ongoing relationship
with Alzheimer's Society

1543
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.760
and Alzheimer's Research.
he had pre-donated his brain.

1544
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.120
We were ardently campaigning
to a particular project

1545
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.120
to forward research into dementia.
and it was called.

1546
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.680
and it is called
Brains for Dementia Research.

1547
01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.960
I got a call from the family. erm.

1548
01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.520
and I was told
that he would be very happy

1549
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.200
to have his brain
left in a bucket for research.

1550
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.560
It shows the man's humour.

1551
01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.080
I think Mum and I held onto
his ashes for nearly a year

1552
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.360
before really deciding what to do.

1553
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.440
And then. one day.
we just chatted and said...

1554
01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.640
"Do you know.
these should really go to Pinewood.

1555
01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.560
"That's where he belongs."

1556
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.480
So. Mum and I
and Joy and Linda came down.

1557
01:19:54.480 --> 01:20:00.200
I think. er. Gerry Jr had gone back
to his home by then in Tasmania.

1558
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.080
and we just had
a nice. private 15 minutes.

1559
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.280
We were gonna pour the ashes
into the lake from the bridge.

1560
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.480
but it was a bit windy
and that wasn't going to work.

1561
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.600
so I just went down by the lakeside

1562
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.520
while Mum and my two sisters
stood on the bridge. while I...

1563
01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.080
..poured his ashes into the lake.

1564
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.640
It's a beautiful place. and it's
nice to have somewhere that is...

1565
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.840
despite its surroundings.
it's sort of unique to him.

1566
01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.000
So there's...
Yeah. there was nowhere better.

1567
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.920
People like that
don't come along very often.

1568
01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.440
who established a whole new genre
in entertainment

1569
01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.200
which is loved. universally.

1570
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.360
by everybody.

1571
01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.400
You know. whenever I'm asked
about Thunderbirds.

1572
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.200
people's eyes light up.

1573
01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.280
He didn't deserve
to have such a terrible end.

1574
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.280
When I left Mum's house.

1575
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.560
I set off on a journey
of several hundred miles

1576
01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:13.520
to come to a place that...

1577
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.160
has become more and more apparent

1578
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:20.560
that is the site
of so much of Dad's inspiration.

1579
01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.800
It's the place
where one incident happened

1580
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.320
that changed his life forever

1581
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.840
and set him on a path of creation.

1582
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.480
trying to become a success.

1583
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.360
trying to make something
of his life.

1584
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.560
And after many. many hundreds
of miles. and many hours of driving.

1585
01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.440
we are about to arrive...

1586
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.760
at that place.
in Arnhem. in the Netherlands.

1587
01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.280
"The Queen and I offer you
our heartfelt sympathy

1588
01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.560
"in your great sorrow.

1589
01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.560
"We pray that your country's
gratitude for a life so nobly given

1590
01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.480
"in its service may bring you
some measure of consolation."

1591
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.720
But I suspect that was
of little comfort to them.

1592
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.360
I started this journey not really
fully understanding Dad. Erm...

1593
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.240
Understanding some things about him

1594
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.920
and feeling like I had an inkling
of what motivated him

1595
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.360
and why he did what he did
and why he behaved the way he did.

1596
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.160
If it wasn't for Lionel
first asking that question

1597
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.720
about what's at
the edge of the universe.

1598
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.280
and it wasn't for
his time in Light Rescue.

1599
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.560
his time as a hero pilot.

1600
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.720
a template for nearly every
leading character in Dad's shows.

1601
01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.520
and without Lionel's
brush with Hollywood.

1602
01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.560
then Dad's life might've
taken a very different path.

1603
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.160
But really. I think nothing
affected him more in Lionel's life

1604
01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.960
than Lionel's death.

1605
01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.880
Not only did his death inspire him

1606
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:26.120
to create utopian worlds that
were devoid of religion and war.

1607
01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.320
Lionel was an idol
that he tried to live up to.

1608
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.520
but he never felt that he succeeded.

1609
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.560
But I think it instilled in him
the need to be successful

1610
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.080
and to try and make his parents
proud of him.

1611
01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.520
That's in spite of Debbie
telling him

1612
01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.040
that he should've been killed
instead of his brother.

1613
01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.200
Dad would've done anything
to make his parents proud.

1614
01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.240
even though it was most likely
their dysfunctional marriage

1615
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.280
that led him to being
unable to deal with conflicts.

1616
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.360
be they professional or personal.

1617
01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.680
His parents' failings would see Dad

1618
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.520
try to create
his perfect childhood on screen.

1619
01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.560
filled with money
and toys and gadgets.

1620
01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.560
But no mothers
and only strong fathers.

1621
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.120
Without all these
hidden childhood influences.

1622
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.760
his creations would
likely never have existed.

1623
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.000
So having started this journey
not really...

1624
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.840
knowing Dad at all...

1625
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.760
..I feel like I can now say
that I. I do know him.

1626
01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.840
Possibly better
than he knew himself.

1627
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.720
So. here...

1628
01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.640
at the final resting place
of the most influential figure

1629
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.920
in Dad's life...

1630
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.840
is the best place
for my journey of discovery

1631
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840
to come to an end.

1632
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.920
I don't think
I've got the kind of mind

1633
01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.680
that worries about being remembered.

1634
01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.680
But I suppose I'd like to think
people said that he was a nice guy.

1635
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.720
and I think I would like
people to say that

1636
01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.360
he was a very responsible person
with the films that he made.

1637
01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.360
That he did not encourage people
to shoot Grandma through the head.

1638
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.760
and didn't encourage drug-taking.

1639
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.280
and hopefully brought
a lot of good quality.

1640
01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.360
wholesome entertainment for kids.

1641
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.480
I had a friend
who would describe somebody

1642
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.560
and say.
"He was a very human being."

1643
01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.720
I think it's nice.

1644
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.200
and perhaps that's something
I'd like to be described as.

1645
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.000
If you could say anything
to Gerry today.

1646
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.480
what would you say?

1647
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.640
HE SNIFFLES

1648
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.560
I just...

1649
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.240
HE SNIFFLES

1650
01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.280
Erm...

1651
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.840
Gosh.

1652
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560
What would I say?

1653
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.080
I'd have just wanted to say
"Thank you" to him.

1654
01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.640
"Thank you for the excitement."

1655
01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.200
I think simply
that he was appreciated.

1656
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.960
I'm really glad
that you met somebody

1657
01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.240
that you were able to be happy with
for the rest of your life.

1658
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.640
I'd want him to know that...

1659
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.920
Oh. God. Stop it.

1660
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.160
I want him to know that
I forgive him for everything.

1661
01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.040
And I think just that he should've
