her mother and her sister that.

347
00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:23.918
"Your daughter Mary.
she’s gonna sing for royalty.

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.336
"Your daughter Mary.

349
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.672

351
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.843

"Yeah. yeah. yeah. Right."

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.386
Because at any moment.

353
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.305
somebody could just pull
the rug up from under you.

COMBS:
When I first met Mary.

406
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.658
I was working at Uptown.

407
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:04.329
She came to my office
and she sung a cappella for me.

408
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.414
(Mary vocalizing)

409
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.838
COMBS: It was just
this raspy. like. gutter.

410
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:17.342
ghetto tone. pain.

411
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.469
like just everything
that was going on.

412
00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.680
’cause there was a lot of pain
in the streets.

413
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.766
(Mary continues vocalizing)

414
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:38.321
COMBS: And there was
a lot of young Black women

415
00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.366
who could relate
to where she came from.

416
00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.660
They didn’t have
no voice out there.

417
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.664
Then. man. this girl from
Schlobohm projects

418
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.166
with a attitude.
that’ll fight you.

419
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:53.503
that got a slash on her face.
she got a cut on her face.

420
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.088
like. "Man."

421
00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:58.967
I was like.
"She is gonna be big.

422
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.179
because...
nobody sounds like her."

423
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.808
He believed in me
more than I believed in myself.

424
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:11.145
I didn’t know what I had.
who I was. but he knew.

425
00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:14.357
And he helped me to believe
that I was a real artist.

426
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.692
and I needed that.

427
00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.276
I needed that push.
I needed that pep talk.

428
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.028
I needed that. "You got it. sis.

429
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.780
You can do it.
I’m proud of you."

430
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:25.493
I needed everything he gave me.
because I was very insecure.

431
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.706
NAS: Mary coming out of
Schlobohm projects.

432
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:33.042
she has one foot there.
struggling to get out.

433
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.713
and one foot
in the recording studio.

434
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.840
with this opportunity to

435
00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.510
give this voice to the world.

436
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:45.680
HARRELL: For Puff. this was
early on in his career.

437
00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:48.099
and he was looking to stand out

438
00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:51.060
and make a name for hisself
within Uptown.

439
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:54.564
And we were very supportive of.
"You go ahead. do that.

440
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:57.233
We’ll provide the resources
so you can kill that."

441
00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.028
(quiet chatter)

442
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.320
COMBS:
The last one you-- when I told--

443
00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:02.822
the thing I told you
before you went in there.

444
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:04.782
I said. "Say it like you know it
and be confident with it."

445
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.284
and that’s how you were
singing the whole way through.

446
00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:08.619
-That was good about it.
-Okay.

447
00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.413
MARY: I didn’t even know
what I was doing.

448
00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.790
because I was in survival mode.

449
00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:15.543
meaning. like. I had
to save my family. you know.

450
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.337
I had to make sure that they
were all out of the projects

451
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:23.176
and they were good. and I was
singing for my life. literally.

452
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:24.761
COMBS:
At the end of the chorus.

453
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:26.888
you had just said a little bit
more at the end of the chorus

454
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.474
-on the. on the one before that.
-Okay. cool.

MISA HYLTON: I met Mary
at the studio with Puffy.

456
00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:34.437
and we spent
a lot of time together.

457
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.023
We quickly became like sisters.

458
00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.068
COMBS:
Misa was my girl.

459
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:43.029
the mother of my first son.
Justin.

460
00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:45.406
and Misa was just the flyest.
you know?

461
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.617
It was just. like. her cut.

462
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.079
the way she was just
doing her hair. her bob.

463
00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.371
the way she was
wearing her swag.

464
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:53.706
You know what I’m saying?
I was like.

465
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.334
"Yo. you should be
a stylist for Mary."

466
00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:59.087
Early in our career.
it was really difficult

467
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.881
to get our foot in the door
with the fashion houses.

468
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:04.217
First. we were young.

469
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.053
Secondly. we were female.

470
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.222
And then we were
women of color--

471
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.807
young women of color.

472
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.018
("Real Love" playing.

473
00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:19.357
And so I had to design and
create custom looks for Mary.

474
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.692
And I know that
I saw things in her

475
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.277
that she didn’t see in herself.

476
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.071

the day-to-day
of living in the projects

684
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.320
to...

685
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:13.200
one day hearing Mary’s records
on the radio.

686
00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:15.244
(laughs): but we still
lived in the projects.

687
00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:17.705
Then the next thing
you know. like.

688
00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:21.291
we’re moving to a suburb.

689
00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:23.043
It was extreme. (chuckles)

690
00:33:23.127 --> 00:33:24.336
It was an extreme transition.

691
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.338
-(jet engine whirring)
-Hi.

692
00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:28.549
Hi. How you doing. ma’am?
Frank Dickens is my name.

693
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.050
Mary.

694
00:33:30.134 --> 00:33:31.760
MARY:
I measure success for myself

695
00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:36.432
when I’m able to.
from the inside.

696
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:39.560
be happy enough to know
that I’m successful.

697
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:42.396
to know that
I did something great.

698
00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:43.939
to be secure enough to know

699
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.316
that I am great
or I did something great.

700
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.694
and that’s why
I can understand it now.

701
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.904
I didn’t understand it then
because I wasn’t--

702
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:53.615
I didn’t feel like
I was great in my heart.

703
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:57.661
It’s. "Hey. I know
you see me as this person

704
00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:59.455
"and my life looks like
so much fun.

705
00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:02.666
"Well. guess what.
my life sucks. too.

706
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.878
"And. you know. and I’m doing
everything I can to make it--

707
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:07.379
to get over it and get better."

708
00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:09.089
"Well. you have all this money."
(stammers)

709
00:34:09.173 --> 00:34:11.175
Oh. bullshit.
You know what I mean?

710
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:13.385
I know more people who have
had money. have lost it.

711
00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:17.181
have had it. and they--
doesn’t. doesn’t change you.

712
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.224
The way they feel inside.

713
00:34:19.308 --> 00:34:22.019
I couldn’t even enjoy...

714
00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:23.479
what-what was going on.

715
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:25.063
I couldn’t even
enjoy my success.

716
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:30.444
And I was in a relationship
where we were both young.

717
00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:32.946
both super successful.

718
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:37.701
I loved him. you know. but
neither one of us could handle

719
00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:39.536
the success of our lives.

720
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:45.292
So we became very. um. dark.
the whole thing.

721
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:47.211
And abusive.

722
00:34:47.294 --> 00:34:49.171

723
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:53.926

It was like.

I’m-a play myself

728
00:35:04.937 --> 00:35:07.773
so I don’t think I’m special.
so I can be with you.

729
00:35:13.403 --> 00:35:14.947
CHUCKY THOMPSON:
When I first met Mary.

730
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.950
she had on. I swear.
you had a sweat suit on

731
00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:21.078
with the little
suede bucket jawn. dude.

732
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:23.372
-and the Timberland jawns on.
dude. -(laughter)

733
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.374
And was in the corner like this.

734
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.084
I said. "Man. I’m not saying
nothing to her. yo.

735
00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:28.627
(laughter)

736
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.214
She be done whupped everybody
head up in this jawn. dude."

737
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.591
When it came to production. I
was pretty much new to the game.

738
00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:36.468
I had a couple of records
out at the time.

739
00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:38.804
And then Puff comes to me.
and he’s like.

740
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:40.806
"Yo. I got this record
to do with Mary.

741
00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:42.891
and if you want to do it.
let’s do it."

742
00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:44.643
COMBS: So many people
were coming up to me

743
00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.144
and they’d be like.
"You gonna be all right

744
00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:48.397
with the sophomore jinx?"

745
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.691
The sophomore jinx. you know.

746
00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:53.193
People don’t usually
come out with a-a album

747
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.362
that’s doper than
their first one.

748
00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.617
That’s when I hooked up
with Chucky and Bub.

749
00:36:00.701 --> 00:36:03.787
Can’t stop the Bub rush.

750
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:05.914
BIG BUB:
I was 23 years old.

751
00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:07.916
I’m writing
for different artists.

752
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.420
and here comes Puffy like. "Yo.
I need these records for Mary."

753
00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:14.214
I’m like. "Okay. cool."

754
00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:17.885
First time we met.
she was so cool.

755
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:20.888
Elevator door open up.
she’s in there with security.

756
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.265
and I came through there
with my. "Yo."

757
00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:24.766
I said. "We ’bout
to make history.

758
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.226
We ’bout to make some crack."

759
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.644
She was like this.

760
00:36:27.728 --> 00:36:29.730
"Oh. really?
Well. we gonna see."

761
00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.523
I said. "Okay. cool."

762
00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:33.400
I said. "Watch.

763
00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:36.612
Watch. Mary. We ’bout
to change the whole game."

764
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:38.822
And the rest is history.

765
00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:42.242
MARY: I always made it where
I controlled the environment.

766
00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:44.077
It’s like I didn’t
really trust people.

767
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.330
so I didn’t like
a lot of people around

768
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:50.208
unless I knew them and we were
really. really close.

769
00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:51.460
-Yo. what’s up?
-How you doing?

770
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.628
Chillin’. How are you?

771
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:54.171
THOMPSON:
I wasn’t even looking at Mary

772
00:36:54.254 --> 00:36:57.299
as. uh. you know.
as this big artist.

773
00:36:57.382 --> 00:37:00.636
I looked at her in the light of
being. like. my extended sister.

774
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:05.057
And... I just wanted
to make sure she had that royal

775
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.851
but yet still grounded.
hood feeling

776
00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:12.522
about the songs that we were--
or that I was delivering to her.

777
00:37:12.606 --> 00:37:17.110
And at-at that particular time.
you know. it was the early ’90s.

778
00:37:17.194 --> 00:37:19.780
so a lot of music
that was happening at that time

779
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:23.033
reflected 20 years back.
which was the ’70s.

780
00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:27.829
Which was really. like. a lot
of Black exploitation films

781
00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:31.583
and just that energy
of street music and street life.

782
00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:33.293
and we embodied that.

783
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.796
We’re both from the same

784
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:38.048
hood or whatever
you want to call it.

785
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:41.426
People that are in that.
it’s not all good all the time.

786
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.720
So when you find somebody
that’s good.

787
00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:46.014
it’s like. man.

788
00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:47.516
You know what I’m saying?

789
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.184
It’s-it’s good out here
in the world.

790
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.894
So I’m-a be real.

791
00:37:50.978 --> 00:37:53.230
When-when that first
411 album came out.

792
00:37:53.313 --> 00:37:56.233
and I know that Puff was
pushing the fashion thing.

793
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:58.360
and it was like
a little hard-core.

794
00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:00.570
I said. "Hold up. joe.

795
00:38:00.654 --> 00:38:03.198
It’s-it’s more to her
than that."

796
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.574
So. I guess. from the songs

797
00:38:04.658 --> 00:38:07.119
and the way I was coming
with that music.

798
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:09.329
I-- that was where
my brain was at.

799
00:38:09.413 --> 00:38:11.331
You was dead-on with that shit.

800
00:38:11.415 --> 00:38:14.418
You was dead-on with the dark.
the dark that I was living.

801
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.461
You was dead-on with
the street that I came from.

802
00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:17.879
You was dead-on with the--

803
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.756
-all the shit that I was.
-(chuckles)

804
00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.049
What’s the 411? was dope.

805
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:22.718
It felt good. It was great.

806
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:24.720
It was all the stuff.
but by the time

807
00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:29.558
I got to this My Life part
of my life. I was all fucked-up.

808
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:32.644
and I needed somebody
to understand. through music.

809
00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:35.522
and you-you tr-- you-you did.

810
00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.232
You understood.

811
00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:40.819
Her truth came out more
on My Life than What’s the 411?

812
00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:44.322
What’s the 411? came out
real. real dope.

813
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:45.949
But then when we went to this.

814
00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:49.077
when we went to this
another level of truth.

815
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:50.787
My Life was
a whole different thing.

816
00:38:50.871 --> 00:38:52.122
The "Be With You" track

817
00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:55.167
-jump-started the whole feeling.
-Yo. that’s it. man.

818
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.961
When I heard that--
Puff came to my house in Jersey.

819
00:38:58.045 --> 00:38:59.963
and he-he was like. "Yo. I got
something for you to hear."

820
00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:03.300
He was just. like. you know. all
antsy and. you know. excited.

821
00:39:03.383 --> 00:39:05.802
So I get in the car with Puff.
and it starts.

822
00:39:05.886 --> 00:39:07.512
-(humming "Be With You")
-("Be With You" playing)

823
00:39:07.596 --> 00:39:08.889
Yep.

824
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:12.434
And it just grabbed everything
that I was feeling.

825
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:16.188
And I just. like-- I-I may have
started writing it on the spot.

826
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.273
♪ ♪

827
00:39:21.777 --> 00:39:24.988
That record was
the beginning of it all.

828
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:29.409
It was the beginning of me
spilling myself into this album.

829
00:39:29.493 --> 00:39:31.411
We used to hear that.
like. all day.

830

Like. that’s what she was-- that
was her first. like. first song.

831
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:36.333

835
00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:44.549
I remember when
we made that record.

836
00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:49.346
It was one of the most
unsecured times of our lives.

837
00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:52.265
I was going through
breaking up with Misa.

838
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:56.061
You know. Mary was going through
a lot of things with K-Ci.

839
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:59.397
And we was in this studio
in New York

840
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:04.152
that you could actually see
outside. and it was raining.

841

00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:28.451
"I don’t know what to do.
I’m so sad.

1183
00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:29.869
I feel lonely."

1184
00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:34.582
-I think growing up in general
is just rough. -MAN: Mm.

1185
00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:37.001
It’s really rough.
and just trying to. like.

1186
00:55:37.084 --> 00:55:39.128
find out who you are
and then having people

1187
00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:40.755
tell you who you are
at the same time

1188
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.673
-is just really frustrating.
-WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

1189
00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:45.301
So. um...

1190
00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:49.138
My Life was kind of just like.
yo. like. somebody. like.

1191
00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:51.640
somebody out there is
feeling that exact same way.

1192
00:55:51.724 --> 00:55:53.726
Because. like. whenever you’re
going through something. like.

1193
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.728
automatically
you-you feel alone.

1194
00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:57.480
you feel like no one gets it.
you feel like no one

1195
00:55:57.563 --> 00:56:00.107
in the world can ever
go through that experience.

1196
00:56:00.191 --> 00:56:03.861
and then it’s like Mary-Mary.
she’s right here.

1197
00:56:03.944 --> 00:56:06.280
She’s telling me. like.
"Hey. you’re not by yourself.

1198
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:07.615
You can get through this."

1199
00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:10.868
So. My Life. like. for me.
just felt like

1200
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.746
it was just an anthem
to be strong and to just keep

1201
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:16.373
pushing through. like. whatever
it is that you’re going through.

1202
00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:18.209
(others murmur quietly)

1203
00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:19.794
WOMAN: You know.
I was always one of these people

1204
00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:23.255
that could not tell the truth.

1205
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:26.258
especially if it was painful

1206
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:31.597
or I had to put on this façade
that I was this strong woman.

1207
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.809
and inside I was
just. like. breaking up.

1208
00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:37.603
like this big hole
was inside of me.

1209
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:42.399
And I was like. "Damn. when-when
is this ever going to change?"

1210
00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:47.321
And that part when she said.
"You don’t have to fake it."

1211
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:50.282
I was like. "Oh. you don’t?"

1212
00:56:50.366 --> 00:56:53.619
Like. you really
could be authentic.

1213
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:54.995
MAN:
Mm.

1214
00:56:55.079 --> 00:56:57.123
-I love her so much.
-WOMAN: Me. too.

1215
00:56:57.206 --> 00:57:00.459
MAN:
When I was. like. 13. 14.

1216
00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:03.963
those songs like "My Life."
you know. held me together.

1217
00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:05.798
-WOMAN: Yes.
-And...

1218
00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.008
I was going through a lot.
you know.

1219
00:57:08.092 --> 00:57:10.136
Like. why would a kid
be going through a lot?

1220
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:11.762
Well. I was going through
a lot of--

1221
00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:14.932
I went through a lot of trauma
growing up. a lot of abuse.

1222
00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:17.017
So...

1223
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.894
it...

1224
00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:22.565
The-the song "My Life"
in particular made...

1225
00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:24.692
for the first time in my life.
made me feel like

1226
00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:26.569
I could relate to somebody.

1227
00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:28.737
And...

1228
00:57:28.821 --> 00:57:31.907
I also want to share that.
at one point in my life--

1229
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:35.619
I think I was. like. 16--
I was about to commit suicide.

1230
00:57:35.703 --> 00:57:40.416
It was... I was being picked on
for being. you know. a big guy.

1231
00:57:40.499 --> 00:57:45.337
for being myself. and. you know.
being gay or whatnot.

1232
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:47.923
and it was just all too much.

1233
00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:50.384
And...

1234
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:54.263
it was that song. "My Life."
that helped me

1235
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:56.557
to not actually
go through with that.

1236
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.726
-MAN: That’s awesome.
-Yeah. -WOMAN: Beautiful.

1237
00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:05.566
MARY: I want the fans
to understand how important

1238
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.359
they are to me.

1239
00:58:07.443 --> 00:58:09.695
’cause I didn’t think
I would even make it

1240
00:58:09.778 --> 00:58:12.239
to see this day
during that time.

1241
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:14.241
I didn’t think I was gonna live.

1242
00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:16.035
♪ ♪

1243
00:58:16.118 --> 00:58:20.998
But something happened one day
when it was just too much.

1244
00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:24.752
I was sitting in my living room.
I had been up all night long.

1245
00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:28.297
And... it looked like
the window opening.

1246
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.341
All these clouds came in.

1247
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:32.843
I was just high out of my mind.

1248
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.056
And my heart started racing.
and it was a Sunday morning.

1249
00:58:37.139 --> 00:58:39.225
I always feel strange
on a Sunday morning.

1250
00:58:39.308 --> 00:58:42.519
I always feel like God can see.
really see what I’m doing.

1251
00:58:42.603 --> 00:58:44.521
And I was like.
"I don’t want to do this.

1252
00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:46.607
I-I got to stop doing this."

1253
00:58:47.775 --> 00:58:49.568
Either you choose life
or you choose death.

1254
00:58:49.652 --> 00:58:53.489
and I chose life.
and it wasn’t even so much me

1255
00:58:53.572 --> 00:58:55.866
that was important to me.
it was my fans.

1256
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:57.493
They bought the album.

1257
00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:59.245
They listened
to what I had to say.

1258
00:58:59.328 --> 00:59:01.497
They said. "Me. too. Mary."
and that was it.

1259
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.499
That was the beginning
of our relationship.

1260
00:59:03.582 --> 00:59:05.668
and I think
that’s what-what I needed.

1261
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:09.463
I needed someone to understand.

1262
00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:13.133
’Cause it seemed like
no one ever did.

1263
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:20.099
They help me to sustain
and want to live

1264
00:59:20.182 --> 00:59:22.810
and survive on my journey.

1265
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:26.480
We did something really great
and really powerful.

1266
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:30.776
uh. inspiring each other.
by inspiring...

1267
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:34.530
each other to want to live
to see another day.

1268
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.244
So I just want people to just...
know that they-they’re not--

1269
00:59:40.327 --> 00:59:42.496
when you think you’re alone.
you’re not alone.

1270
00:59:44.164 --> 00:59:47.626
We-we soldiers out here.
all of us.

1271
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:50.754
We got a job to fight. and
we all in the fight together.

Her gift and her singing

1283
01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:28.542
and the way she sings
and where it comes from.

1284
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.085

with trauma and pain and just so
much. so much. so much. so much.

1289
01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.261
You got to let it out.

1290
01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:41.263
And you can put
a pin in it and...

1291
01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:42.973
and blow up the whole world--

1292
01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:46.393

But-but to have that moment

1296
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.945
where you take the edge of the

1297

Oh!

1309
01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:29.770
(chuckles) Who is that?

1310
01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.188
-That’s my baby.
-Cute little Mary.

1311
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.190
Look at my little girl.

1312
01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.234
Oh. my God.

1313
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.444
WOMAN: ...just the title track.
"My Life." I thought that was...

1314
01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:40.572
I know. The picture’s all fat.
and I look like Skeletor.

1315
01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:41.865
-No. you don’t.
-(laughs)

1316
01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:43.367
You’re so cute.

1317
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.952
WOMAN: ...just about
what you were going through.

1318
01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.954
You look like
you’re giving her that eye.

1319
01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.831
WOMAN: ...but again.
running to your emotion.

1320
01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.291
Well. I wrote it
when I was in...

1321
01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.460
I was living--
I first moved to Jersey.

1322
01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:56.755
Uh. that’s when I started
the second album in summer.

1323
01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:59.925
And I wrote it
through just watching...

1324
01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.636
...even as I was little.

1325
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.390
watching people. couples
or whatever go through...

1326
01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.268
Looking at my face. I probably
didn’t like the interviewer.

1327
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.522
-Mm-hmm. -And. um. I didn’t want
to give her everything.

1328
01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:17.401
I didn’t want to tell her
what I was really dealing with.

1329
01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.236
because it was
none of her fucking business.

1330
01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.864
-And I was really.
really mean then. -(laughs)

1331
01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:25.033
So if it was some energy
that I picked up that was wrong.

1332
01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.536
I was. I-I... I withheld.

1333
01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:30.414
I didn’t want her to know where
all the shit really came from.

1334
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.416
It was. "It’s none of
your fucking business."

1335
01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.668
-You understand?
-WOMAN: Wait. is it-- like what?

1336
01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.920
-Going through what. though?
-Whatever.

1337
01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.255
You know what I’m saying?

1338
01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.132
Whatever it may be.

1339
01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.634
MARY: That’s my child and
that’s who I protect. you know?

1340
01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:44.261
That-that girl right there

1341
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:47.681
and little five-year-old Mary
I protect today.

1342
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.683
-You know what I’m saying?
-WOMAN: I do.

1343
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.018
Never mind.
You don’t understand.

1344
01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.394

Wow.

1349
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:06.825
I’ve always had a thing
where my intuition was strong.

1350
01:03:06.909 --> 01:03:11.163
and it would make me
go into a pr-protection mode.

1351

1482

with drugs.

1484

Some people never have an outlet
to-to express themself

1485
01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:01.930

or they die early.

1486

Anxiety. all kind of shit.

1487
01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:06.226
But then when you do
have that outlet.

1488
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.854
then you can always
express yourself freely.

1489
01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.522
and then you got
a bunch of people around you

1490
