00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.638
-  Stay down!

4
00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:44.085
Don't move!

5
00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:50.316
Yeah!

6
00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:58.964
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the <i>Sawyer-Two.</i>

7
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.834
We're under attack by pirates.

8
00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.565
Requesting an immediate aid.

9
00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:09.369
<i>They say everybody's
good at something.</i>

10
00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:11.541
<i>Me? I talk to fish.</i>

11
00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.140
<i>That's how I met
my friend. Storm.</i>

12
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:18.882
<i>He's always there
when I need a lift.</i>

13
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.628
<i>Some people
think that makes me a joke.</i>

14
00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:34.433
<i>But I don't care.
You know why?</i>

15
00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:36.131
<i>'Cause I'm also good
at something else.</i>

16
00:01:40.438 --> 00:01:42.174
<i>And that's breaking heads.</i>

17
00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:51.014
Pow! Papa took on
all the pirates.

18
00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.820
I was like.
"Well. the pirates
think that--"

19
00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:55.612
- Hi-ya!

20
00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.819
Papa kicked their butts.

21
00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:03.729
Those chum lickers
didn't stand a chance.

22
00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.794
Ooh!

23
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.000
<i>Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.</i>

24
00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:10.270
Yeah! Come on!

25
00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:13.801
- Watch out.

26
00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:21.338
Sorry. Pops. My bad.

27
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.549
<i>Oh. yeah.
this is my son. Arthur Jr.</i>

28
00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:27.115
<i>See. four years ago.
everything changed.</i>

29
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.687
<i>I met a woman. fell in love.
and the next thing I know.</i>

30
00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:32.186
<i>we're getting married
and having a kid.</i>

31
00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.593
<i>This little guy's
the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

32
00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.237
<i>- But this kid.
he doesn't sleep.</i>

33
00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.372
What you got in there. huh?

34
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.038
Okay--

35
00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:51.506
<i>And he never misses.</i>

36
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:53.006
- What the...

37
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.945
<i>And then.
I'm up at the crack of dawn</i>

38
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.777
<i>because on top of getting
married and having a kid...</i>

39
00:02:56.913 --> 00:03:00.182
<i>- ...I finally got a job.</i>

40
00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:03.418
<i>That's right.
I'm the king
of freaking Atlantis.</i>

41
00:03:06.827 --> 00:03:08.591
<i>- How did I score that.
you asked?</i>

42
00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:10.428
<i>Well. I stopped
my brother. Orm.</i>

43
00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:12.993
<i>from attacking
the surface world.</i>

44
00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.929
<i>And in doing so.
I claimed the throne from him.</i>

45
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:18.335
<i>At first I was all like...</i>

46
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.804
-  Yeah!

47
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.838
The territorial waters
are long held...

48
00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:24.642
<i>But then.
as it turned out.</i>

49
00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:26.208
<i>being king wasn't all
it was cracked up to be.</i>

50
00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:30.610
<i>It's just meetings
all day and politics.</i>

51
00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:32.914
<i>I'm so bored.
I don't even know
which end of the Brine King</i>

52
00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.785
<i>I'm supposed to be looking at
half the time.</i>

53
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.890
Whoo!

54
00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:39.359
Yeah! That was awesome!

55
00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:40.990
<i>And if
that's not bad enough.</i>

56
00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:43.326
<i>turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing</i>

57
00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:45.161
<i>that nobody told me about.</i>

58
00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:48.061
<i>Which basically gets to shoot
down everything I want to do.</i>

59
00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.866
<i>The only thing
that makes all the hard work</i>

60
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.973
<i>and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.</i>

61
00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.939
Hey! [laughs] You missed me!

62
00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.814
<i>But of course.
there are fun parts of the job.</i>

63
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.919
Whoa!

64
00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:07.515
<i>I get
to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.</i>

65
00:04:11.722 --> 00:04:14.757
<i>Especially
when I get to take down
an illegal cage fight or two.</i>

66
00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.530
<i>But for everything I get right.</i>

67
00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:24.464
<i>something else gets screwed up.</i>

68
00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:35.609
Ah. fu--

69
00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:46.393
<i>♪ Born to be wild ♪</i>

70
00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:03.773
-  Oh. yeah.
-  Here you go.

71
00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:10.483
<i>Slainte.</i>

72
00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:17.889
So...

73
00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:20.926
he's gonna need
a little brother or sister
to play with.

74
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.065
He's got a dog.

75
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.733
Hey. I'm serious.

76
00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:33.070
I saw how lonely it was
for you growing up.

77
00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:34.672
An only child.

78
00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:39.072
I always regretted
I couldn't give you that.

79
00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:42.506
Yeah. well.
don't be too hard on yourself.

80
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.146
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dick bag.

81
00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:46.619
Come on.

82
00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:50.785
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

83
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.493
Sure. siblings bicker
and fight...

84
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.926
but at the end of the day.
they're family.

85
00:05:58.062 --> 00:06:01.800
You should be able
to count on them for help.

86
00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:05.399
Yeah. well. I'll still take
the dog over him any day.

87
00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:13.513
Hey. look at that.

88
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.426
Holy crap.

89
00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:35.194
Hi. baby boy.
Are you talking
to the fishies?

90
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:42.370
Oh. man.
Pops. this is blowing my mind.

91
00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:45.709
My whole life I've wanted
to share this gift
with someone.

92
00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:48.977
Yeah. but you and me. son.
we're different.

93
00:06:49.678 --> 00:06:51.747
We're special.

94
00:06:51.883 --> 00:06:53.845
We're connected
to the land and the sea.

95
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:58.788
I can't wait to introduce you
to all the majestic creatures
on our planet.

96
00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:02.160
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

97
00:07:02.295 --> 00:07:03.629
Yeah. you and me.

98
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.887
I cross-referenced
the coordinates from Dr. Shin.

99
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.350
Nothing.

100
00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:05.791
Still no sign
of Atlantean remnants
under the ice.

101
00:08:05.927 --> 00:08:08.529
Looks like he's led us
on another wild goose chase.

102
00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:27.943
Every day I don't fix
my power suit

103
00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:31.079
is another day Aquaman
gets to live.

104
00:08:35.156 --> 00:08:36.952
Check again.

105
00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:39.824
We're close this time.
I can feel it.

106
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.433
Expedition log day 463.
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

107
00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:55.134
My quest for Atlantis
has brought me
to the ends of the earth.

108
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.111
David Kane
is losing his patience.

109
00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:01.778
If I don't turn up
the Atlantean technology
he's looking for soon.

110
00:09:01.914 --> 00:09:05.344
they're probably going to...
um...

111
00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:08.015
You know what.
let's not even go there.

112
00:09:08.151 --> 00:09:10.652
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

113
00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.966
Dr. Shin. take a look at this.

114
00:09:25.102 --> 00:09:27.538
Please tell me
you found something.

115
00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:29.440
Seismic array is going crazy.

116
00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:30.974
Where's the epicenter?

117
00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:32.943
We're standing on it.

118
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.803
- Run!

119
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.119
What just happened?
An earthquake?

120
00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:51.692
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

121
00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:30.896
Come on. Get up.

122
00:11:32.968 --> 00:11:34.868
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

123
00:11:35.003 --> 00:11:37.364
Come on. get up.
Go. we gotta go! We gotta go!

124
00:11:39.334 --> 00:11:41.500
Come on. we gotta move!
Come on!

125
00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:05.392
Please. please. No. no!
Help. please! Don't let go!

126
00:12:36.093 --> 00:12:38.128
What the hell happened to you?

127
00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:41.560
There's something back there.

128
00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:58.146
Astounding.

129
00:12:58.282 --> 00:13:00.283
My readings show
something's down here.

130
00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:03.083
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

131
00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.420
If it is. we might be able
to scavenge the tech you need
to fix your suit.

132
00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:10.456
How is this place
even possible?

133
00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:11.963
This was all probably solid ice

134
00:13:12.098 --> 00:13:15.199
until we started
heating the planet.

135
00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:18.402
Well. thank God
for global warming. am I right?

136
00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:21.941
Uh. yeah.
that's not exactly
a good thing.

137
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.356
The tracks lead down there.

138
00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:44.558
Suit up.

139
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:48.699
Wait. The tracks lead
down there. which means...

140
00:13:48.835 --> 00:13:50.871
the monster's down there.

141
00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.472
Okay. I guess
we're going down there.

142
00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:25.334
I don't believe this.

143
00:14:26.874 --> 00:14:29.776
It's a structure of some kind.

144
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.408
And there's more buried
in the ice.

145
00:14:32.543 --> 00:14:35.612
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

146
00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:39.282
-  Everyone.
fan out and search.
-  Yes. sir.

147
00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:42.483
We've stumbled upon
something big here. doc.

148
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:48.427
This has to be
a few thousand years old.

149
00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:50.161
Astounding.

150
00:14:56.536 --> 00:14:58.004
Whoa.

151
00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:00.039
Uh...

152
00:15:40.613 --> 00:15:41.608
Ow...

153
00:15:57.897 --> 00:16:00.130
What is this place?

154
00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:07.436
<i>At last. you are here.</i>

155
00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:39.004
Free me from my prison

156
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.142
and I will grant you
the strength

157
00:16:42.277 --> 00:16:45.976
<i>to kill the man
who murdered your father.</i>

158
00:16:46.112 --> 00:16:47.779
You can't leave him like this!

159
00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:49.706
You ask the sea for mercy.

160
00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:51.511
Get out of here!
You need to live

161
00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:53.981
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

162
00:16:54.117 --> 00:16:58.489
<i>You will take from him
what he stole from you.</i>

163
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.362
<i>His home will burn</i>

164
00:17:03.497 --> 00:17:08.662
<i>and his kingdom will fall
before my legions.</i>

165
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.169
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!

166
00:17:16.304 --> 00:17:17.709
David. No. David.

167
00:17:17.845 --> 00:17:19.205
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

168
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.713
David. David. it's okay.

169
00:17:21.848 --> 00:17:23.215
You're all right.

170
00:17:24.842 --> 00:17:26.284
What the hell is that thing?

171
00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:42.465
<i>...Just unbelievable footage</i>

172
00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:44.396
<i>coming in
from all around the world.</i>

173
00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:46.632
<i>Good evening. folks.</i>

174
00:17:46.768 --> 00:17:49.171
<i>In the past five months.
we've seen an extraordinary
rise in temperatures</i>

175
00:17:49.307 --> 00:17:51.206
<i>reported around the world.</i>

176
00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:54.907
<i>And that has resulted
in some of the wildest weather
we've ever seen.</i>

177
00:17:55.043 --> 00:17:58.582
<i>Yes. this is thundersnow
in Dallas. Texas.</i>

178
00:17:58.717 --> 00:18:00.418
<i>- Visibility is near zero...</i>

179
00:18:00.553 --> 00:18:02.453
<i>...and there's more snow
expected tonight</i>

180
00:18:02.589 --> 00:18:05.688
<i>than Dallas usually sees
in an entire year.</i>

181
00:18:05.823 --> 00:18:08.623
<i>It's only one part of
a worldwide weather phenomenon</i>

182
00:18:08.758 --> 00:18:11.260
<i>unlike anything
we've ever seen before.</i>

183
00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.461
Arthur.

184
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.340
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

185
00:18:24.476 --> 00:18:27.743
There's been
another plague outbreak.

186
00:18:27.879 --> 00:18:31.147
<i>...scientists are
at a loss to explain.</i>

187
00:18:31.283 --> 00:18:33.182
<i>But the real question is.</i>

188
00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:34.683
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

189
00:18:34.818 --> 00:18:37.454
<i>And how much hotter
is it going to get?</i>

190
00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.459
Where did it hit this time?

191
00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:44.592
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis.

192
00:18:44.728 --> 00:18:46.427
and there are now reports
of outbreaks

193
00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:48.697
in the Fishermen Kingdom
as well.

194
00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:51.734
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

195
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.563
Why now?

196
00:18:53.698 --> 00:18:57.005
Increased ocean acidity.
decreased oxygen levels.
toxic algal blooms.

197
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.843
Take your pick.

198
00:18:58.978 --> 00:19:04.373
The surface has been
poisoning our atmosphere
for over a century.

199
00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:06.382
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

200
00:19:06.517 --> 00:19:09.112
if they don't even know
we exist.

201
00:19:09.247 --> 00:19:10.650
If you want to be a part
of the conversation.

202
00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:13.391
we have to take our seat
at the table.

203
00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:21.296
It's time for Atlantis
to reveal itself
to the surface.

204
00:19:25.366 --> 00:19:28.472
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position
on this.

205
00:19:28.607 --> 00:19:30.570
Listen. we can talk
to their scientists

206
00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:34.741
and combine our technologies
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

207
00:19:34.877 --> 00:19:37.543
And I know this is
against our traditions.

208
00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:39.077
but the world is shrinking.

209
00:19:39.213 --> 00:19:41.650
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

210
00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.323
Times have changed.

211
00:19:45.223 --> 00:19:46.621
Atlantis wants this.

212
00:19:46.756 --> 00:19:48.060
There's a whole generation
out there

213
00:19:48.196 --> 00:19:49.591
that don't want
to hide anymore.

214
00:19:49.727 --> 00:19:53.065
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

215
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.059
killed your own beloved mentor.

216
00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:59.300
and you want to negotiate
with them?

217
00:19:59.436 --> 00:20:04.369
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master
for a reason.

218
00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:08.678
If we ever decide
to make ourselves known
to the surface-dwellers.

219
00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:12.945
it will be to eradicate them.
not to co-exist.

220
00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:43.448
Hey. not bad.

221
00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:47.782
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

222
00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:49.652
I don't know
how you did it. Pops.

223
00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.788
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us.

224
00:20:51.923 --> 00:20:54.287
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

225
00:20:54.422 --> 00:20:56.725
And you...

226
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:00.366
taking care of me.
raising me on your own...

227
00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.669
You're the real superhero.

228
00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:11.806
- To single parents.
- Mmm.

229
00:21:13.747 --> 00:21:16.910
Well. my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

230
00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:20.520
Yeah. well.
I just plain suck at my job.

231
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:24.020
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

232
00:21:24.156 --> 00:21:28.626
The problem is
half of Atlantis still
wants to destroy the surface.

233
00:21:28.761 --> 00:21:31.129
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

234
00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:34.226
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

235
00:21:34.362 --> 00:21:35.797
I know.

236
00:21:38.037 --> 00:21:39.438
I miss him.

237
00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:43.607
Hey.

238
00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:48.108
You can't save them all. son.

239
00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:52.385
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

240
00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:56.389
I just kept going.

241
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.657
You celebrate the wins.
you mourn the losses.

242
00:21:59.792 --> 00:22:02.323
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

243
00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:04.428
Sometimes not giving up

244
00:22:04.564 --> 00:22:07.092
is the most heroic thing
you can do.

245
00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:08.659
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

246
00:23:09.561 --> 00:23:11.661
Yeah. don't worry about that.

247
00:23:11.797 --> 00:23:14.534
You just remember
who built this ship.

248
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:17.133
I'm more worried about
how long ago they built it.

249
00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:21.969
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

250
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.054
Hey. doc.

251
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:43.859
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

252
00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:57.168
Expedition log. day 613.

253
00:23:57.304 --> 00:23:59.876
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

254
00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:03.010
<i>A three man
octobot infiltration team.</i>

255
00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:07.343
<i>It's incredible
that these ancient machines
we found</i>

256
00:24:07.478 --> 00:24:09.611
<i>still function
after all these years.</i>

257
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:11.651
<i>All I did was retrofit them
to our needs.</i>

258
00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:16.195
<i>But they require
a very specialized fuel
to keep them running.</i>

259
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:18.223
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

260
00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:20.095
<i>I don't know how
he knows about this.</i>

261
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.869
<i>but it all started the day
he found that trident.</i>

262
00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:25.870
<i>Suddenly. he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know.</i>

263
00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:28.600
<i>including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum</i>

264
00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:31.878
<i>is to steal it
from highly-protected
storage vaults.</i>

265
00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:34.976
<i>And we're about to hit the most
dangerous one of them all.</i>

266
00:25:20.927 --> 00:25:23.629
Okay. you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

267
00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:26.665
<i>No margin for error.</i>

268
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:42.945
<i>Yeah. this should
take you through.</i>

269
00:25:56.664 --> 00:25:58.159
<i>We don't want
any confrontation.</i>

270
00:25:58.294 --> 00:26:01.095
<i>David. we can't fight
their entire army.</i>

271
00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:19.549
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

272
00:26:19.684 --> 00:26:22.182
<i>We have no idea
what kind of security measures
they have down there.</i>

273
00:26:48.109 --> 00:26:50.377
<i>Commencing extraction.</i>

274
00:26:50.512 --> 00:26:53.246
<i>Be careful.
It's highly volatile.</i>

275
00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:02.728
<i>Loading barge now.</i>

276
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:23.513
Stingray. change of plans.

277
00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:25.113
I need an extraction now!

278
00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:28.847
- All hands to battle stations.

279
00:28:02.346 --> 00:28:03.822
Astounding.

280
00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:10.288
Attention. unidentified vessel.

281
00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:11.894
You are out
of the transit zone.

282
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:14.332
Doctor. power up
the sonic battery.

283
00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:17.664
Illegal border crossing
will be met with deadly force.

284
00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:18.600
Now!

285
00:28:21.037 --> 00:28:22.775
Commencing charge.

286
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.649
Border Control.
intruder approaching.

287
00:28:31.784 --> 00:28:33.714
Arm hydro cannon
and lock target.

288
00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:36.315
Hydro cannon
at front border gate
locking in on target.

289
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:38.186
Chargers set
to maximum power.

290
00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:42.592
Intruder in sight.

291
00:28:42.727 --> 00:28:44.159
Take them out!

292
00:28:48.363 --> 00:28:51.837
What are you waiting for?
Fire!

293
00:29:22.534 --> 00:29:25.434
Sir. Atlantean hostiles
are approaching.

294
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.701
Split up.
Make your way
to the extraction point.

295
00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:29.072
Roger.

296
00:29:29.207 --> 00:29:30.707
They've raided
the storage vault.

297
00:29:30.842 --> 00:29:31.974
We can't let them get away.

298
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.144
Don't worry. they won't.
I'm on this one.

299
00:29:49.429 --> 00:29:50.455
Hold your fire!

300
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:52.421
They're cutting
through the Night Market.

301
00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:54.493
Watch out for the civilians.

302
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.645
Warning. Warning.

303
00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:52.450
Illegal entrance
into hypertube.

304
00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:55.417
Exceeding maximum speed
of 600 knots.

305
00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.396
Reduce speed immediately.

306
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.603
Oh. shit.

307
00:32:00.428 --> 00:32:02.253
<i>David. we're here
at the extraction point.</i>

308
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:05.794
<i>The orichalcum is onboard
and secure.
Come on. let's go!</i>

309
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.030
Not yet!

310
00:32:07.165 --> 00:32:10.002
I'm gonna kill me
a dead mermaid.

311
00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:23.411
Get away from my wife!

312
00:32:24.848 --> 00:32:26.313
Your wife?

313
00:32:26.449 --> 00:32:28.785
First you steal
your brother's throne.

314
00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:30.721
then you steal his woman?

315
00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:34.182
Aquaman. shame on you.

316
00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:42.398
Uh. David. we gotta go.

317
00:32:42.533 --> 00:32:44.562
The entire Atlantean army
is headed this way.

318
00:32:44.698 --> 00:32:47.039
If we don't leave now.
we're dead.

319
00:33:34.515 --> 00:33:36.484
Twenty degrees port!

320
00:33:52.335 --> 00:33:54.370
Fire the sonic cannon!

321
00:33:54.939 --> 00:33:56.240
Come on. Shin!

322
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.322
<i>Lady Karshon has called</i>

323
00:34:11.457 --> 00:34:13.485
<i>an emergency session
of the High Council</i>

324
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:17.021
<i>to discuss a motion
that would strip the throne
of its executive power.</i>

325
00:34:17.157 --> 00:34:21.757
<i>The throne
is the heart of Atlantis.</i>

326
00:34:21.892 --> 00:34:24.259
<i>Too often now it stands empty.</i>

327
00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:27.805
<i>while our king spends half
his time on land.</i>

328
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.505
<i>And now his
surface world enemies
have followed him home.</i>

329
00:34:32.641 --> 00:34:35.312
<i>This tragedy is merely
a taste</i>

330
00:34:35.447 --> 00:34:37.612
<i>of the havoc
that will be wrought.</i>

331
00:34:37.748 --> 00:34:41.419
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes known
to the surface.</i>

332
00:34:41.554 --> 00:34:45.090
<i>Because if he cannot protect
his own family.</i>

333
00:34:45.225 --> 00:34:48.523
<i>how is he supposed
to protect us?</i>

334
00:34:55.402 --> 00:34:58.797
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

335
00:34:58.932 --> 00:35:00.833
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

336
00:35:00.968 --> 00:35:03.303
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

337
00:35:03.439 --> 00:35:04.703
The technology seems ancient.

338
00:35:04.839 --> 00:35:06.972
but we've never seen
anything like it.

339
00:35:07.108 --> 00:35:11.181
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

340
00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.016
that disrupts
the nervous system.

341
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:14.450
Do we know what was stolen?

342
00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:18.850
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

343
00:35:20.392 --> 00:35:21.954
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

344
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.429
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

345
00:35:25.564 --> 00:35:28.166
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

346
00:35:28.302 --> 00:35:29.829
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

347
00:35:29.964 --> 00:35:32.731
In fact. we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

348
00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:35.506
before we realized
what we were doing.

349
00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:39.005
It can't be disposed of safely.
so the remaining stockpile

350
00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.711
has been buried
in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

351
00:35:42.847 --> 00:35:44.610
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

352
00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:47.417
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

353
00:35:47.552 --> 00:35:49.381
We think he's been
launching secret raids

354
00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:51.287
for at least five months.

355
00:35:51.423 --> 00:35:52.750
This is just the time
he got caught.

356
00:35:52.886 --> 00:35:54.422
Well. this spike
in global temperatures

357
00:35:54.558 --> 00:35:56.254
that's causing disasters
on the surface

358
00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:01.126
and making
the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

359
00:36:01.262 --> 00:36:04.764
He's using
the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

360
00:36:06.434 --> 00:36:08.339
Why would he do that?

361
00:36:08.474 --> 00:36:10.337
I don't know.
but I'm gonna find out.

362
00:36:10.473 --> 00:36:13.772
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet.
we don't have much time.

363
00:36:13.908 --> 00:36:15.878
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

364
00:36:16.014 --> 00:36:20.413
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown
is imminent.

365
00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:21.847
We need to find him.

366
00:36:21.982 --> 00:36:23.619
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

367
00:36:23.754 --> 00:36:26.291
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

368
00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:28.854
But you're not gonna like it.

369
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:32.093
Your brother?

370
00:36:32.228 --> 00:36:34.397
Believe me.
he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help.

371
00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:36.260
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past.

372
00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:38.568
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

373
00:36:38.703 --> 00:36:42.368
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

374
00:36:42.503 --> 00:36:44.507
He killed their king.

375
00:36:44.642 --> 00:36:46.874
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

376
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.443
Arthur. Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

377
00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:53.945
It would be an act of war.

378
00:36:55.253 --> 00:36:56.981
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

379
00:36:58.125 --> 00:36:59.856
I'm gonna break him out myself.

380
00:36:59.992 --> 00:37:03.551
Arthur. Karshon is looking
for a reason
to seize war powers.

381
00:37:03.687 --> 00:37:06.364
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

382
00:37:06.499 --> 00:37:07.759
My place is out there
where I belong.

383
00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:09.300
where I'm actually good
at what I do.

384
00:37:09.436 --> 00:37:11.699
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

385
00:37:12.434 --> 00:37:13.899
I've got to do this.

386
00:37:15.268 --> 00:37:18.770
If anyone finds out.
if you're caught...

387
00:37:18.906 --> 00:37:21.346
it will tear
the kingdoms apart.

388
00:37:22.709 --> 00:37:25.549
Then help me not get caught.

389
00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:31.789
<i>Xebelian intelligence
has recently learned</i>

390
00:37:31.924 --> 00:37:33.789
<i>that your brother
is being held
on the surface</i>

391
00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:36.392
<i>in a secret one-of-a-kind
underground facility.</i>

392
00:37:36.528 --> 00:37:38.395
<i>They're assuming
no sea dweller</i>

393
00:37:38.531 --> 00:37:40.595
<i>would ever dare
cross the desert.</i>

394
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.060
And here's a special outfit
for you.

395
00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:46.300
What is that.
boy's extra medium?

396
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:47.601
It's supposed to be tight.

397
00:37:47.736 --> 00:37:49.067
The chromatophores
change color

398
00:37:49.202 --> 00:37:50.705
<i>and camouflage you
for up to a minute.</i>

399
00:37:50.841 --> 00:37:53.441
<i>making you undetectable
to most sensors.</i>

400
00:37:53.576 --> 00:37:55.677
<i>They'll never see you coming.</i>

401
00:37:57.913 --> 00:37:59.148
What are we doing for comms?

402
00:37:59.284 --> 00:38:00.983
Open comms are too risky.

403
00:38:01.118 --> 00:38:04.587
I'll be sending
a cephalopod with you
to act as a messenger.

404
00:38:06.157 --> 00:38:07.557
That's an octopus.

405
00:38:07.692 --> 00:38:10.861
Tactical Operations
and Pursuit Operative.

406
00:38:10.996 --> 00:38:12.659
Topo. for short.

407
00:38:12.795 --> 00:38:14.693
Genetically
engineered intelligence

408
00:38:14.828 --> 00:38:17.160
for infiltration and espionage.

409
00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:20.537
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

410
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.380
Just try and lay low
when we get in there. okay?

411
00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:30.239
You might be invisible.
but your hectocotylus

412
00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:32.414
is starting to smell like
warm chum butter.

413
00:38:34.517 --> 00:38:36.282
Aw. Topo. you dumb squid!

414
00:38:36.418 --> 00:38:37.983
God. come on!

415
00:38:39.959 --> 00:38:41.486
Is ink piss?

416
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:44.293
<i>The prison is guarded
by fearsome Deserter remnants.</i>

417
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:45.727
<i>Death-worshipping ascetics</i>

418
00:38:45.863 --> 00:38:47.993
<i>who survived
when the Sahara went dry</i>

419
00:38:48.128 --> 00:38:50.864
<i>by turning to blood
for sustenance.</i>

420
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.200
<i>If they catch you.
they'll bleed you dry.</i>

421
00:38:54.773 --> 00:38:56.672
<i>When you find Orm.
he'll be weak.</i>

422
00:38:56.808 --> 00:38:59.674
<i>They're limiting
his water supply...</i>

423
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.414
<i>just enough
to keep him alive.</i>

424
00:39:05.481 --> 00:39:07.712
And if you do see Orm.

425
00:39:07.848 --> 00:39:09.520
you tell him that I love him.

426
00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:14.085
You tell him
that I think of him every day.

427
00:39:14.553 --> 00:39:15.689
I will.

428
00:39:15.824 --> 00:39:17.221
Look.
I know he's family.

429
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:19.757
but you can't forget
who you're dealing with here.

430
00:39:19.892 --> 00:39:21.566
Once you've broken Orm out.

431
00:39:21.702 --> 00:39:23.095
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

432
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.405
<i>You need him.
but you can never trust him.</i>

433
00:40:27.464 --> 00:40:30.568
Whoo... You look rough.

434
00:40:30.703 --> 00:40:33.566
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?

435
00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:35.001
I'm here to break you out.

436
00:40:35.769 --> 00:40:36.969
Have you lost your mind?

437
00:40:37.105 --> 00:40:39.542
You're the one who put me here.

438
00:40:39.678 --> 00:40:41.073
Eh. why you
bringing up old shit?

439
00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:43.014
- We'll talk about it later.

440
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.912
You cannot break me out.

441
00:40:45.048 --> 00:40:47.246
There's a treaty
with the Fishermen Kingdom.

442
00:40:47.382 --> 00:40:49.916
Look. I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

443
00:40:50.052 --> 00:40:51.385
And you're the only one
that can help me.

444
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:52.687
So you do the math.

445
00:40:52.823 --> 00:40:56.121
-  Oh. shit.

446
00:40:56.256 --> 00:40:58.561
Come on. Cast Away.
Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

447
00:40:58.696 --> 00:41:00.631
- Come on. Let's go.

448
00:41:14.478 --> 00:41:16.680
This changes nothing.

449
00:41:16.815 --> 00:41:18.814
Wouldn't have it any other way.
little brother.

450
00:41:20.243 --> 00:41:21.982
Do not call me "brother."

451
00:41:23.213 --> 00:41:25.557
<i>Hermanito?</i> Come on.

452
00:41:29.763 --> 00:41:32.790
Come on. Topo.
you stupid squid!

453
00:41:32.926 --> 00:41:34.258
Wake up and open the door.

454
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.162
Topo?

455
00:41:38.731 --> 00:41:40.238
The cephalopod?

456
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.233
Trust me. it wasn't my idea.

457
00:41:43.977 --> 00:41:45.108
Topo!

458
00:41:56.784 --> 00:41:58.689
All right. come on.

459
00:42:05.727 --> 00:42:07.797
Wait.

460
00:42:10.033 --> 00:42:12.431
Did you... bring water?

461
00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:13.466
Yeah.

462
00:42:13.602 --> 00:42:15.406
Uh. no. sorry.

463
00:42:15.541 --> 00:42:17.202
I drank it all
on the way here.

464
00:42:18.104 --> 00:42:20.579
- What?
- Bro. it's hot up there.

465
00:42:41.497 --> 00:42:44.532
Whoa! Easy.

466
00:42:44.668 --> 00:42:47.837
- Whoa!

467
00:42:51.876 --> 00:42:53.275
You know how
to ride one of these?

468
00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.535
Are you kidding?

469
00:42:54.671 --> 00:42:55.871
I don't even know
what the hell it is.

470
00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:57.143
- Hyaah!
- What?

471
00:43:01.814 --> 00:43:04.117
Yeah!

472
00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:15.260
Yeah!

473
00:43:17.565 --> 00:43:18.736
Whoa.

474
00:43:35.278 --> 00:43:37.689
Whoa. whoa. whoa. no!

475
00:44:15.288 --> 00:44:16.920
All right.
the water's right there.

476
00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:18.389
Let's go. skinny jeans.

477
00:46:08.773 --> 00:46:11.105
Yeah. All right.

478
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.033
Good job. little brother.
High-five.

479
00:46:13.169 --> 00:46:14.536
No.

480
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.881
All right.
Good job.

481
00:46:24.786 --> 00:46:28.149
You know. I got a bunch
of king shit to do
back in Atlantis

482
00:46:28.284 --> 00:46:29.894
so we should go.

483
00:46:30.794 --> 00:46:32.831
Ahh! Come on. Topo!

484
00:46:55.287 --> 00:46:57.648
This is worse than
I could have possibly imagined.

485
00:46:57.784 --> 00:47:01.357
The safety and security
of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

486
00:47:01.492 --> 00:47:04.093
No king has allowed
the great city wall
to be breached

487
00:47:04.229 --> 00:47:06.597
- in a hundred generations.

488
00:47:06.733 --> 00:47:08.361
A hundred generations? Really?

489
00:47:08.496 --> 00:47:10.395
How many years is that?
I'm bad with geology.

490
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.003
What is that. like.
a million years?

491
00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.940
Oh? You're calling me
one in a million?

492
00:47:16.075 --> 00:47:18.975
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

493
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.077
It's undignified for a king
to jest.

494
00:47:21.212 --> 00:47:23.343
Oh. excuse me. Your Highness.
if I use comedy

495
00:47:23.478 --> 00:47:25.949
to mask my feelings
and deal with stress.

496
00:47:26.085 --> 00:47:27.408
Otherwise.
I'd end up looking like you.

497
00:47:27.543 --> 00:47:29.580
A very tight butthole.

498
00:47:30.456 --> 00:47:33.247
Super tight.

499
00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:36.856
You know.
if the pressures of leadership
are too stressful.

500
00:47:36.992 --> 00:47:38.558
perhaps you should leave

501
00:47:38.693 --> 00:47:41.361
and let someone
who knows what they're doing
be king.

502
00:47:43.129 --> 00:47:44.962
You know what?

503
00:47:45.097 --> 00:47:47.268
I cannot wait to throw your ass
back in prison
when this is all over.

504
00:47:48.134 --> 00:47:49.836
You won't have to.

505
00:47:49.971 --> 00:47:51.939
Once I stop David Kane.
I'll surrender myself
to the Fishermen.

506
00:47:52.075 --> 00:47:54.374
That is my honor to Atlantis.

507
00:47:55.538 --> 00:47:56.804
You're so dramatic.

508
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.116
Whatever.
Just help me find this asshole.

509
00:47:59.252 --> 00:48:01.986
Well. my contact will at least
know where to look.

510
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.517
What happened to him?

511
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.494
David Kane that I knew was
ruthless.

512
00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:11.519
but he wasn't insane.

513
00:48:11.654 --> 00:48:14.999
<i>This guy just put a gun
to the world's head
and pulled the trigger.</i>

514
00:48:15.134 --> 00:48:17.298
<i>Without even making
any demands.</i>

515
00:49:21.163 --> 00:49:22.696
Congratulations. Dr. Shin.

516
00:49:22.831 --> 00:49:25.201
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

517
00:49:26.629 --> 00:49:27.597
Well. you found it.

518
00:49:27.733 --> 00:49:30.869
All I did was figure out
how it worked.

519
00:49:31.004 --> 00:49:34.371
I didn't think we'd
ever actually have to use it
on anyone.

520
00:49:34.506 --> 00:49:36.980
Yeah. well. what can I say?

521
00:49:37.115 --> 00:49:38.914
Things don't always
go as planned.

522
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:40.513
But that's what I'm afraid of.

523
00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:47.058
David. this stuff
could reshape
the entire planet.

524
00:49:49.826 --> 00:49:51.029
Hey. doc.

525
00:49:53.590 --> 00:50:00.666
We are this close
to unlocking the greatest power
in human history.

526
00:50:00.801 --> 00:50:04.207
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

527
00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:10.081
If I said yes.
would you let me?

528
00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:13.447
Sure.

529
00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:17.620
You want to see how
long you last in that jungle?

530
00:50:19.658 --> 00:50:20.824
Be my guest.

531
00:50:34.169 --> 00:50:35.601
Yeah. I'll stick around.

532
00:50:38.643 --> 00:50:39.836
Yeah.

533
00:50:54.392 --> 00:50:57.025
<i>Welcome to the last frontier.</i>

534
00:50:57.161 --> 00:51:01.198
<i>They scavenged ships
from around the world
to build this place.</i>

535
00:51:02.198 --> 00:51:03.629
<i>The Sunken Citadel.</i>

536
00:51:03.764 --> 00:51:05.335
<i>It is the one place
in the world</i>

537
00:51:05.471 --> 00:51:08.106
<i>where the scum of the land
and sea mingle.</i>

538
00:51:09.408 --> 00:51:11.268
<i>It is where people
come to disappear.</i>

539
00:51:11.403 --> 00:51:12.572
<i>Wow.</i>

540
00:51:13.539 --> 00:51:16.378
It's an impressive shithole.

541
00:51:16.514 --> 00:51:18.510
How have I never
heard of this place before?

542
00:51:18.646 --> 00:51:21.212
It is not meant
to be common knowledge.

543
00:51:21.348 --> 00:51:22.549
It's a pirate haven.

544
00:51:23.622 --> 00:51:24.551
Pirates?

545
00:51:26.359 --> 00:51:27.552
Listen. I don't know
if you know this about me.

546
00:51:27.688 --> 00:51:29.990
but I'm not too popular
with pirates.

547
00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.172
Oh. I'm well aware.

548
00:51:47.347 --> 00:51:50.647
Relax. It was the only way
to get us both in.

549
00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.514
You could've at least
given me a heads up.

550
00:51:55.649 --> 00:51:56.988
Would you have
gone along with it?

551
00:51:57.123 --> 00:51:59.118
- Hell. no.
- Then put a hook in it.

552
00:52:31.957 --> 00:52:33.490
There. That's Kingfish.

553
00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:35.418
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

554
00:52:35.554 --> 00:52:39.453
He brokers deals with pirates.
mercenaries. slavers.
you name it.

555
00:52:39.588 --> 00:52:41.161
Cool.

556
00:52:41.297 --> 00:52:42.326
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

557
00:52:42.462 --> 00:52:45.069
Just let me handle this.

558
00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:46.735
He's our best shot
at finding Manta.

559
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.203
and he's not going to tell us
anything if you go in there

560
00:52:49.338 --> 00:52:51.275
flexing your muscles at him.

561
00:52:53.239 --> 00:52:56.313
You're so lucky we didn't grow
up together. little brother.

562
00:52:57.478 --> 00:53:00.113
Do not call me "brother."

563
00:53:00.248 --> 00:53:01.449
Well...

564
00:53:01.585 --> 00:53:05.720
This is a bit of a surprise.
isn't it?

565
00:53:05.856 --> 00:53:09.124
I didn't realize
you'd been released
from prison.

566
00:53:09.259 --> 00:53:12.191
It is a recent development.

567
00:53:12.327 --> 00:53:16.333
Outlaws. aren't we all?

568
00:53:17.267 --> 00:53:19.463
We need to find David Kane.

569
00:53:19.598 --> 00:53:22.436
Bad news. I'm afraid.

570
00:53:22.571 --> 00:53:26.140
David Kane is no longer
on the market.

571
00:53:26.276 --> 00:53:28.973
Not for sale at any price.

572
00:53:29.108 --> 00:53:33.840
He's solely running
as an independent operator.

573
00:53:33.976 --> 00:53:35.979
Where is he holed up now?

574
00:53:39.422 --> 00:53:41.952
In exchange. I offer a favor...

575
00:53:43.029 --> 00:53:46.528
from the King of Atlantis.

576
00:53:48.292 --> 00:53:50.398
You seriously expect me
to play footsie with someone

577
00:53:50.534 --> 00:53:52.363
with that kind of blood
on their hands?

578
00:53:52.499 --> 00:53:54.967
I don't have hands!

579
00:53:55.103 --> 00:53:56.367
Or feet!

580
00:54:01.274 --> 00:54:02.477
Um...

581
00:54:02.613 --> 00:54:05.978
Listen. if the information
checks out good.

582
00:54:06.113 --> 00:54:09.315
I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

583
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:10.981
and tear this place apart.

584
00:54:12.924 --> 00:54:15.522
That's too bad.

585
00:54:15.658 --> 00:54:17.690
Traditionally.
the kings of Atlantis

586
00:54:17.826 --> 00:54:22.363
have turned a blind eye
to the Sunken Citadel.

587
00:54:22.498 --> 00:54:26.502
Now. we have to blind it
for you.

588
00:54:34.937 --> 00:54:36.945
Fine. Flex your muscles.

589
00:54:49.161 --> 00:54:50.955
Smash his stupid head in!

590
00:54:51.995 --> 00:54:53.331
Boom!

591
00:55:09.046 --> 00:55:10.414
Gotcha. fatback!

592
00:55:13.552 --> 00:55:16.753
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

593
00:55:16.888 --> 00:55:18.182
Talk.

594
00:55:18.318 --> 00:55:20.754
I don't know where he is.
but there have been rumors.

595
00:55:20.889 --> 00:55:23.389
A dormant volcano
in the South Pacific.

596
00:55:23.524 --> 00:55:25.363
called "Devil's Deep."

597
00:55:25.964 --> 00:55:27.097
Talk faster.

598
00:55:27.232 --> 00:55:28.565
It's been barren for years.

599
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.725
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

600
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.537
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start
to get close.

601
00:55:33.672 --> 00:55:36.539
And if you get too close.
you don't come back!

602
00:55:36.674 --> 00:55:39.574
If I was a betting man.
and believe me. I am.

603
00:55:39.709 --> 00:55:41.977
I'd say that's where Kane
is hiding out.

604
00:55:45.614 --> 00:55:47.385
We got all we needed. Let's go!

605
00:55:58.798 --> 00:56:02.730
<i>♪ Rise up. come
Rise up through the fire ♪</i>

606
00:56:08.137 --> 00:56:11.140
Soon you'll be
more powerful than he is.

607
00:56:11.276 --> 00:56:13.266
But you're not ready yet.

608
00:56:13.402 --> 00:56:16.146
and you involved him
far too soon.

609
00:56:16.282 --> 00:56:18.775
I sense them closing in on us.

610
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.583
Do I seem concerned?

611
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.385
Hmm?

612
00:56:22.521 --> 00:56:25.413
If anything.
it's even easier now.

613
00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.920
We couldn't have planned it
any better than--

614
00:56:33.395 --> 00:56:36.000
Oh. Oh.

615
00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:37.868
Hey.

616
00:56:38.004 --> 00:56:40.830
Uh. I... I just wanted
to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

617
00:56:40.966 --> 00:56:42.935
is now running at peak output.

618
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.824
I win.

619
00:57:41.032 --> 00:57:44.667
Topo. go back to Atlantis
and give them our coordinates.

620
00:57:52.371 --> 00:57:54.144
You know
what'd be amazing right now?

621
00:57:54.279 --> 00:57:55.778
Reinforcements?

622
00:57:55.913 --> 00:57:58.114
Great. big. greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

623
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:01.779
You gotta admit. the food
is so much better up here.

624
00:58:01.914 --> 00:58:03.347
I find that hard to believe.

625
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:05.184
Hold up.

626
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.787
You telling me
you never went topside
to have a cheeseburger?

627
00:58:06.922 --> 00:58:10.284
- What?
- Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

628
00:58:10.419 --> 00:58:12.760
Or a thick. juicy.
medium raw steak

629
00:58:12.895 --> 00:58:14.457
with fries and a shake.
and you dip it--

630
00:58:14.592 --> 00:58:17.364
Even the words
that surface-dwellers
give their food

631
00:58:17.499 --> 00:58:20.301
sound disgusting.

632
00:58:20.436 --> 00:58:23.663
You've let your prejudices
stop you from enjoying
half the world.

633
00:58:23.799 --> 00:58:27.171
You should think about that.
It's your loss. dude.

634
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:36.980
Aw. yeah!

635
00:58:37.115 --> 00:58:39.346
Bet you never had one of these.

636
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:42.153
- What is it?
- It's a cockroach.

637
00:58:42.288 --> 00:58:45.255
- You eat it?
- Oh. yeah. Shrimp of the land.

638
00:59:01.577 --> 00:59:02.807
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Eh?

639
00:59:02.943 --> 00:59:04.846
That's good. Here. drink this.

640
00:59:09.044 --> 00:59:10.181
Okay. you first.

641
00:59:43.553 --> 00:59:45.051
Are you seeing this?

642
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.220
That's not normal?

643
00:59:53.927 --> 00:59:56.293
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

644
00:59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.198
Let's get out of here.

645
01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:02.270
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

646
01:00:02.406 --> 01:00:05.704
I bet it mutated
the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time.

647
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.275
turning them... monstrous.

648
01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:09.277
Whoa.

649
01:00:18.718 --> 01:00:19.954
Oh. shit...

650
01:00:31.994 --> 01:00:33.169
Run!

651
01:00:35.998 --> 01:00:36.938
Come on.

652
01:00:39.443 --> 01:00:40.678
Faster!

653
01:00:47.178 --> 01:00:48.882
What the hell are you doing?

654
01:00:49.018 --> 01:00:50.550
I don't know.
I'm not used to running.

655
01:00:50.685 --> 01:00:51.986
Just do what I do.

656
01:00:52.122 --> 01:00:53.757
Use your arms. use your legs.
Lift them up.

657
01:00:54.325 --> 01:00:55.286
Like this?

658
01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:58.525
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

659
01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:00.126
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

660
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.224
- Whoa!

661
01:01:32.326 --> 01:01:34.025
We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

662
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.758
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

663
01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:38.934
What do you wanna do. stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

664
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:41.739
What is that?
What does that say?

665
01:01:41.874 --> 01:01:43.396
The writing
is ancient Atlantean.

666
01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:46.744
"A true king builds bridges."

667
01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:52.545
-  What are you doing?

668
01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.349
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

669
01:02:26.578 --> 01:02:29.547
See?
A true king builds bridges.

670
01:02:32.754 --> 01:02:34.350
That's a metaphor!

671
01:02:34.486 --> 01:02:36.689
Hey!
I forgot to tell you.

672
01:02:36.825 --> 01:02:38.024
Mom says she loves you.

673
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.161
She thinks about you
all the time.

674
01:02:40.296 --> 01:02:42.322
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

675
01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.932
I don't know.
I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

676
01:02:52.134 --> 01:02:53.140
Come on.

677
01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:23.368
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

678
01:03:33.248 --> 01:03:34.741
Uh. David?
I just ran more tests.

679
01:03:34.876 --> 01:03:36.314
and this data
is really disturbing.

680
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.857
We have to stop
burning the... orichalcum.

681
01:03:41.953 --> 01:03:43.157
David?

682
01:03:48.499 --> 01:03:50.032
Oh.

683
01:04:51.822 --> 01:04:57.363
Okay. doc. you want to know
my plan so bad.

684
01:04:58.536 --> 01:05:00.370
Here it is.

685
01:05:00.506 --> 01:05:05.307
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything
he holds dear.

686
01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:10.948
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

687
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:16.142
I will avenge my father.

688
01:05:16.278 --> 01:05:19.484
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

689
01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.389
David. you can't trust
the trident.

690
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:33.832
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

691
01:05:36.635 --> 01:05:39.471
Pray I never show it
to you again.

692
01:06:03.597 --> 01:06:06.292
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

693
01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:08.600
We should wait
for Atlantis
to receive your message.

694
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:10.672
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

695
01:06:10.807 --> 01:06:13.340
Yeah. Look. Loki.
I'm not asking
for your advice on this.

696
01:06:13.476 --> 01:06:15.310
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

697
01:06:15.445 --> 01:06:17.813
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

698
01:06:17.948 --> 01:06:19.548
So. what's your plan?

699
01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.451
I don't have one. yet.
But he came after my wife.

700
01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:23.948
which means
I'm gonna pull his tongue
out of his butt.

701
01:06:24.083 --> 01:06:26.721
Arthur. you are the king.
You cannot
let this get personal.

702
01:06:26.856 --> 01:06:29.682
This coming from the guy
who turned the entire
nation of Atlantis

703
01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:31.426
into his own private ego trip?

704
01:06:31.562 --> 01:06:32.688
My ego?

705
01:06:32.824 --> 01:06:34.260
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

706
01:06:34.396 --> 01:06:35.892
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

707
01:06:36.028 --> 01:06:37.761
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

708
01:06:37.896 --> 01:06:40.965
If you weren't such an asshole.
you'd still be king.

709
01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:42.572
Unbelievable.

710
01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:43.866
Wait. wait! Wait!

711
01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:46.009
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

712
01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:48.568
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

713
01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:51.542
Only reason I'm doing it
is to keep Atlantis
from destroying the surface.

714
01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:53.312
And I might even be
screwing that up.

715
01:06:53.447 --> 01:06:54.748
You really
had no ambition for it?

716
01:06:54.883 --> 01:06:56.319
Absolutely not.

717
01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:58.386
From the day
my father found out
you existed.

718
01:06:58.522 --> 01:07:00.186
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

719
01:07:00.322 --> 01:07:01.624
and challenge me
for the throne.

720
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.150
Wow. that's really sad.

721
01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:04.523
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

722
01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:07.059
with basically no prep time
whatsoever.

723
01:07:07.194 --> 01:07:09.227
Roasted.

724
01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:10.795
That is not how it happened.

725
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:12.630
- That's exactly how
it happened.
- Mera saved you.

726
01:07:12.766 --> 01:07:14.604
No. she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

727
01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.568
Nope. She made
the little water tornado.
I fell in it.

728
01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:18.405
Okay. shut up.
I think we're here.

729
01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:28.378
Sleep. <i>aloha.</i>

730
01:07:28.514 --> 01:07:29.876
Come on. let's do this.

731
01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:31.253
Once this is over with.

732
01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:32.650
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

733
01:07:32.785 --> 01:07:34.419
-  Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

734
01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.423
I don't even
know those words.

735
01:07:47.872 --> 01:07:48.935
- Huh?
- Shh!

736
01:08:03.522 --> 01:08:04.316
Hey!

737
01:08:38.724 --> 01:08:40.157
Whoa. brother.

738
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:44.359
<i>Sasa!</i>

739
01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:52.301
It's an orichalcum furnace.

740
01:08:53.367 --> 01:08:54.904
All that stolen orichalcum.

741
01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:56.504
They're just burning it up.

742
01:08:56.639 --> 01:08:58.941
He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

743
01:08:59.076 --> 01:09:00.542
This is catastrophic.

744
01:09:00.677 --> 01:09:03.069
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

745
01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:05.378
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

746
01:09:05.514 --> 01:09:07.014
Question is.
how do we stop 'em?

747
01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:08.415
To take out this reactor.

748
01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:10.149
we would have to crater
the entire island.

749
01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:13.822
Get away from there! Now!

750
01:09:13.957 --> 01:09:18.525
This blaster may be ancient.
but it was built
for killing Atlanteans.

751
01:09:24.666 --> 01:09:26.736
Okay. I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

752
01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:29.701
I just didn't want you
to break me in half
before I could surrender.

753
01:09:31.206 --> 01:09:32.572
Please take me with you.

754
01:09:33.907 --> 01:09:36.472
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

755
01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:38.771
No. no. Wait. please.

756
01:09:38.907 --> 01:09:40.374
I didn't want any of this.

757
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.485
All I wanted
was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

758
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.621
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

759
01:09:45.757 --> 01:09:49.752
I'm a scientist.
and I just wanted
to be taken seriously.

760
01:09:49.887 --> 01:09:51.323
David Kane said
he could help me.

761
01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:52.991
but now he won't let me leave.

762
01:09:53.126 --> 01:09:56.464
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

763
01:09:57.295 --> 01:09:58.662
I know.

764
01:09:58.798 --> 01:10:00.797
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

765
01:10:00.933 --> 01:10:03.432
But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

766
01:10:03.568 --> 01:10:05.803
Knock him out.

767
01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.243
No.

768
01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.379
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

769
01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:12.979
- What?
- No.

770
01:10:13.114 --> 01:10:15.681
Fine!

771
01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:17.786
You can come with us.

772
01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:19.548
Oh... thank you.

773
01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:22.692
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you
one <i>sasa!</i>

774
01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:23.991
Okay. okay.

775
01:10:24.127 --> 01:10:25.361
It's the black trident.

776
01:10:25.496 --> 01:10:27.527
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

777
01:10:27.663 --> 01:10:29.263
It gives Kane great powers
and in return--

778
01:10:47.085 --> 01:10:49.147
I hate when that happens.

779
01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:03.394
Stop them!

780
01:13:05.419 --> 01:13:08.086
Whoa!

781
01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:09.692
Ow!

782
01:13:09.828 --> 01:13:11.461
Ow!

783
01:13:16.733 --> 01:13:19.365
No. no. no. no. no!
Not the orichalcum!

784
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.566
You wanna blow us up?

785
01:13:20.702 --> 01:13:22.399
- This stuff blows up?
- Yes!

786
01:13:22.534 --> 01:13:25.101
My bad!

787
01:13:27.211 --> 01:13:29.302
Then stop using it!

788
01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.448
Just shut up
and let me save your ass.

789
01:13:32.015 --> 01:13:33.010
Again.

790
01:14:56.063 --> 01:14:58.663
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

791
01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:00.097
I told you he's stronger now.

792
01:15:00.232 --> 01:15:03.804
He's still
just a surface-dweller.

793
01:15:12.415 --> 01:15:14.111
- Bro!
- Bah!

794
01:15:18.454 --> 01:15:22.385
I never expected to see
you two fighting side by side.

795
01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:25.155
We're making
a special exception
just for you.

796
01:15:30.501 --> 01:15:32.662
No one hits my brother but me.

797
01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:37.469
I was gonna
kill you last.
but thanks for dropping by.

798
01:15:37.605 --> 01:15:39.202
You're making this easy.

799
01:15:52.785 --> 01:15:53.951
Yeah!

800
01:15:54.087 --> 01:15:56.659
Come at me.
the killer of kings.

801
01:16:56.882 --> 01:16:58.787
Take that island down!

802
01:17:21.774 --> 01:17:23.240
Fire at will!

803
01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:36.693
We've got to get out of here.

804
01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:48.567
Malfunction. Malfunction.

805
01:17:48.702 --> 01:17:50.168
Warning. Warning.

806
01:18:15.996 --> 01:18:17.833
Shin. let's go!

807
01:18:22.837 --> 01:18:24.339
What are you waiting for?

808
01:18:24.475 --> 01:18:26.303
Fire the goddamn cannon!

809
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.569
I'm sorry
to drag you all into this.

810
01:19:31.704 --> 01:19:33.837
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

811
01:19:33.972 --> 01:19:37.306
Atlantis does not
command the armies of Xebel.
I do.

812
01:19:37.442 --> 01:19:38.813
And the Brine Kingdom

813
01:19:38.949 --> 01:19:40.912
has not forgotten
its debt to you.

814
01:19:41.047 --> 01:19:43.375
You may count on us always.

815
01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:45.314
Something happened to me.

816
01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:48.280
When I touched
that black trident.

817
01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:50.287
Why is he even here?

818
01:19:50.423 --> 01:19:52.090
He should be
on his way back to prison.

819
01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:53.891
We should hear
what he has to say.

820
01:19:54.027 --> 01:19:55.798
I made that mistake once.

821
01:19:55.934 --> 01:19:58.026
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

822
01:19:58.162 --> 01:20:01.299
And he cut off my claw.

823
01:20:01.434 --> 01:20:03.972
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

824
01:20:04.107 --> 01:20:06.573
Look. he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

825
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:08.176
And just for the record.

826
01:20:08.312 --> 01:20:10.605
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

827
01:20:12.847 --> 01:20:14.345
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

828
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.720
Mom. I don't know enough
about this.

829
01:20:20.855 --> 01:20:22.556
Is that even possible?

830
01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:25.719
All anyone knows for sure
is there once
was a seventh kingdom

831
01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:28.593
and then one day.
just before the fall.

832
01:20:28.728 --> 01:20:31.693
every record of it
was stricken
from the chronicles.

833
01:20:31.829 --> 01:20:34.465
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

834
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.703
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

835
01:20:37.839 --> 01:20:39.403
It's called Necrus.

836
01:20:40.271 --> 01:20:42.109
And I didn't just see it.

837
01:20:43.414 --> 01:20:44.408
I knew it.

838
01:20:45.643 --> 01:20:49.347
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

839
01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:54.220
Flashes
of someone else's memories.

840
01:20:54.989 --> 01:20:56.521
During King Atlan's time.

841
01:20:56.656 --> 01:21:00.996
there were
seven united kingdoms
of Atlantis.

842
01:21:01.132 --> 01:21:05.198
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

843
01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:13.472
<i>By exploiting orichalcum.</i>

844
01:21:13.607 --> 01:21:16.911
<i>Necrus rapidly became
a superpower unlike any other.</i>

845
01:21:17.047 --> 01:21:18.813
But it came
at a terrible price.

846
01:21:18.948 --> 01:21:21.843
<i>Poisoning the land. the sea.</i>

847
01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:25.218
<i>even the mind of the tyrant
who ruled Necrus.</i>

848
01:21:28.286 --> 01:21:30.623
Atlan's own brother. Kordax.

849
01:21:30.758 --> 01:21:32.522
-  <i>Atlan pleaded with him</i>

850
01:21:32.657 --> 01:21:34.854
<i>to stop using it
before the world</i>

851
01:21:34.989 --> 01:21:36.524
<i>- was irrevocably damaged.</i>

852
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.268
<i>However.
Kordax resented Atlan.</i>

853
01:21:39.403 --> 01:21:41.967
<i>thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.</i>

854
01:21:42.102 --> 01:21:47.675
<i>So. he resorted to dark magic
and crafted
an instrument of evil.</i>

855
01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:49.235
<i>That black trident.</i>

856
01:21:59.018 --> 01:22:01.985
<i>He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...</i>

857
01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:08.127
...to fight Atlantis.

858
01:22:08.263 --> 01:22:10.164
So. the two brothers
went to war.

859
01:22:19.241 --> 01:22:21.076
<i>But Atlan
defeated Kordax</i>

860
01:22:21.212 --> 01:22:24.113
<i>and imprisoned him
and all of Necrus</i>

861
01:22:24.248 --> 01:22:27.075
<i>with a spell cast
with his own blood...</i>

862
01:22:30.249 --> 01:22:35.415
<i>...to ensure
that Kordax's dark power
would never be found.</i>

863
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:38.456
<i>And that is why
Necrus is stricken
from the chronicles.</i>

864
01:22:49.638 --> 01:22:53.042
This evil was supposed to
remain frozen for eternity.

865
01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.145
But David Kane has found it.

866
01:22:58.739 --> 01:23:01.412
<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

867
01:23:01.548 --> 01:23:03.246
But even
with the ice cap melting.

868
01:23:03.381 --> 01:23:05.319
Kordax still can't be freed.

869
01:23:05.454 --> 01:23:08.023
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

870
01:23:08.158 --> 01:23:09.991
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

871
01:23:10.127 --> 01:23:11.693
Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

872
01:23:11.829 --> 01:23:14.997
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

873
01:23:15.133 --> 01:23:16.859
Blood magic isn't really magic.
it's DNA.

874
01:23:16.995 --> 01:23:22.260
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

875
01:23:22.396 --> 01:23:26.075
That means he needs blood
from either you. me or Arthur.

876
01:23:28.242 --> 01:23:29.573
We're the end of the bloodline.

877
01:23:33.816 --> 01:23:35.951
No. we're not.

878
01:23:36.087 --> 01:23:38.616
<i>...Wildfires
would have made headlines
across the world.</i>

879
01:23:38.751 --> 01:23:40.954
<i>but now. they're almost
a weekly occurrence.</i>

880
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:44.257
<i>We're witnessing
unprecedented weather events
across the globe.</i>

881
01:23:44.392 --> 01:23:45.755
<i>and meteorologists
are at a loss</i>

882
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:47.657
<i>to explain this rapid change
in climate.</i>

883
01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:49.528
<i>From sweltering
heatwaves and droughts.</i>

884
01:23:49.663 --> 01:23:51.562
<i>which are shattering
temperature records.</i>

885
01:23:51.698 --> 01:23:53.268
<i>to torrential rains
and floodings...</i>

886
01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.231
- What is going on?
<i>- ...hurricane bearing down</i>

887
01:23:55.367 --> 01:23:58.239
<i>on the East Coast.
leaving one million homes
without power--</i>

888
01:24:00.372 --> 01:24:03.143
Make that a million and one.

889
01:24:03.278 --> 01:24:05.273
I gotta get the flashlight. bubba.

890
01:24:22.897 --> 01:24:26.533
I'm gonna
leave you alive.
so he can watch you die.

891
01:24:35.106 --> 01:24:36.239
Dad!

892
01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:38.246
-  Tom!
- Dad!

893
01:24:39.276 --> 01:24:40.479
Tom!

894
01:24:41.378 --> 01:24:43.048
No! Dad!

895
01:24:43.183 --> 01:24:44.483
Where's Junior?

896
01:24:47.781 --> 01:24:49.558
No!

897
01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:51.087
I'm sorry. son.

898
01:24:51.222 --> 01:24:52.992
Where's Junior?

899
01:24:53.127 --> 01:24:56.632
Manta... took Junior.

900
01:24:56.767 --> 01:24:58.596
- No!
- No!

901
01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:01.170
No!

902
01:25:56.592 --> 01:25:58.759
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

903
01:25:58.894 --> 01:26:00.294
He will be okay.

904
01:26:00.429 --> 01:26:01.993
We just picked up a signal.

905
01:26:02.128 --> 01:26:03.731
It's faint.

906
01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.428
but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean
sonar frequency.

907
01:26:06.563 --> 01:26:08.501
Headed to Antarctica.

908
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.966
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

909
01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:15.839
I've dreamed of this.

910
01:26:15.974 --> 01:26:18.775
The two of you
standing together
as brothers.

911
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:24.781
Promise me
you will protect each other.

912
01:26:28.088 --> 01:26:29.951
Promise me. Orm.

913
01:26:43.905 --> 01:26:44.933
Go.

914
01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.667
Great waves. Nereus.

915
01:27:13.803 --> 01:27:18.069
Your warship is powerful.
but it's slower than a sea cow.

916
01:27:18.204 --> 01:27:22.974
I say we ditch
all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

917
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.574
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

918
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:27.516
Our only chance is to hit him

919
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:30.251
with total overwhelming force
from every direction.

920
01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:32.249
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

921
01:27:32.385 --> 01:27:33.585
What choice do we have?

922
01:27:33.721 --> 01:27:35.384
We have no defense
against that cannon.

923
01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.752
Well. wait a minute.

924
01:27:36.888 --> 01:27:38.557
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

925
01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:40.657
that messes with
our nervous system. right?

926
01:27:40.793 --> 01:27:43.660
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

927
01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:45.323
Well. what if
we disrupt those echoes

928
01:27:45.459 --> 01:27:47.233
with another soundwave
on the same frequency.

929
01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:49.370
but just much. much louder?

930
01:27:49.505 --> 01:27:51.866
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

931
01:27:52.002 --> 01:27:53.705
Well. that's
gonna be the easy part.

932
01:27:54.637 --> 01:27:56.807
Take your weapons.

933
01:27:58.213 --> 01:27:59.711
And ready your steeds.

934
01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:10.022
Hmm.

935
01:28:20.204 --> 01:28:22.131
Really doesn't like you.
does he?

936
01:28:53.635 --> 01:28:55.670
We made a lot of progress. doc.

937
01:28:55.806 --> 01:28:58.104
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job.

938
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.606
but we were damn close.

939
01:28:59.741 --> 01:29:02.411
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

940
01:29:05.148 --> 01:29:07.383
My God. what did we do?

941
01:29:07.518 --> 01:29:09.947
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

942
01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:12.750
All we did
was fast forward things
a few years.

943
01:29:12.886 --> 01:29:14.388
The ice
hasn't fully melted yet.

944
01:29:14.524 --> 01:29:16.656
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

945
01:29:17.355 --> 01:29:18.558
Here.

946
01:29:18.694 --> 01:29:21.056
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

947
01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.631
Power up the sonic cannon.

948
01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:27.634
Bag the child and suit up.

949
01:29:54.297 --> 01:29:57.193
- Yah!

950
01:29:57.329 --> 01:29:59.831
Captain. we have
multiple incoming hostiles.

951
01:30:01.534 --> 01:30:02.867
You're too late.

952
01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:13.713
No.

953
01:30:39.438 --> 01:30:41.174
Commence charge.

954
01:31:31.625 --> 01:31:34.759
You've got to be kidding me.

955
01:32:10.793 --> 01:32:12.260
Astounding.

956
01:32:55.176 --> 01:32:57.406
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

957
01:32:57.542 --> 01:32:59.976
The throne of Necrus
is in the heart of the city.

958
01:33:00.112 --> 01:33:01.482
I sense something
in the water.

959
01:33:01.617 --> 01:33:02.816
Everyone. light it up.

960
01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:12.456
Didn't you say that Kordax
turned his people
into an army of monsters?

961
01:33:12.591 --> 01:33:14.329
Yes. I did.

962
01:33:14.465 --> 01:33:16.225
Keep your eyes open.

963
01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.262
Well. that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

964
01:33:19.398 --> 01:33:22.363
Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

965
01:33:27.409 --> 01:33:29.638
Fire at will!

966
01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:47.157
I think this goes
all the way through.

967
01:33:47.292 --> 01:33:50.398
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

968
01:33:50.533 --> 01:33:53.334
Go now and save the prince.

969
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:54.967
Thank you. Your Highness.

970
01:33:57.068 --> 01:33:59.701
Come on. you spineless worms!

971
01:33:59.836 --> 01:34:01.270
Bring it on!

972
01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.274
Help me!

973
01:36:14.136 --> 01:36:16.240
Give me the child.

974
01:37:10.323 --> 01:37:13.730
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine. doc.

975
01:37:17.368 --> 01:37:19.708
Get behind
the portcullis!

976
01:37:19.843 --> 01:37:22.843
We need to close the gate!

977
01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:02.840
Get away from my son!

978
01:38:02.976 --> 01:38:06.152
Your blood
will do just fine.

979
01:38:07.889 --> 01:38:10.985
You want blood? Come get it!

980
01:38:24.935 --> 01:38:26.471
Aquaman!

981
01:39:00.038 --> 01:39:01.603
Oh!

982
01:39:14.756 --> 01:39:18.420
You wear
my brother's armor.
and wield his trident.

983
01:39:18.556 --> 01:39:21.254
but you're only
half the man he was.

984
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:24.126
How pathetic.

985
01:39:38.779 --> 01:39:39.844
Mera!

986
01:39:55.258 --> 01:39:56.526
Go!

987
01:40:11.013 --> 01:40:12.806
-  Mera...

988
01:40:13.978 --> 01:40:15.182
Run!

989
01:40:18.818 --> 01:40:20.883
-  Free me
from my prison.

990
01:40:21.018 --> 01:40:26.791
and all my power
will be yours
to wield as you desire.

991
01:41:02.391 --> 01:41:07.366
<i>Kill him.
and you will be
Ocean Master again!</i>

992
01:41:14.808 --> 01:41:17.602
Well. now
this is certainly
an improvement.

993
01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:20.281
Powerful. Atlantean body.

994
01:41:20.416 --> 01:41:23.611
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

995
01:41:23.747 --> 01:41:25.117
It's not true.
Come on. little brother.

996
01:41:25.253 --> 01:41:26.482
I know you're in there.

997
01:41:26.617 --> 01:41:29.047
Don't you see?
You can't win.

998
01:41:29.182 --> 01:41:32.558
Either you kill your brother
or you die.

999
01:41:47.706 --> 01:41:52.140
By an Atlan's blood.
this magic is broken.

1000
01:42:05.459 --> 01:42:09.164
My eternal night
is ending.

1001
01:42:15.931 --> 01:42:18.767
I'm done fighting your puppets.
Kordax.

1002
01:42:19.942 --> 01:42:22.210
I'm coming for you.

1003
01:42:25.081 --> 01:42:25.976
- Give it to me!
-  No!

1004
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:27.579
I can end this.

1005
01:42:27.714 --> 01:42:31.417
Don't let him take it!
Hasn't he taken enough already?

1006
01:42:32.954 --> 01:42:34.121
Yield the throne.

1007
01:42:34.257 --> 01:42:37.556
It's time for me
to reclaim my destiny.

1008
01:42:37.692 --> 01:42:40.685
It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

1009
01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.423
I knew you would do this.

1010
01:42:42.559 --> 01:42:44.329
You are the one true king.

1011
01:42:44.465 --> 01:42:47.932
Atlantis deserves
its one true king.

1012
01:42:50.302 --> 01:42:54.169
I am the one true king!

1013
01:43:01.648 --> 01:43:02.976
<i>You know. there was a time</i>

1014
01:43:03.111 --> 01:43:05.647
when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

1015
01:43:05.783 --> 01:43:07.845
Let you know
that you weren't alone.

1016
01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.589
that we were in it together.

1017
01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:11.820
<i>Promise me
you'll protect each other.</i>

1018
01:43:16.763 --> 01:43:20.433
Come on. little brother.
let's end this bastard.

1019
01:43:20.568 --> 01:43:23.731
I meant what I said
when I first met you.

1020
01:43:23.866 --> 01:43:26.499
No matter what.
you are not alone.

1021
01:43:26.635 --> 01:43:27.973
We're in this together.

1022
01:43:31.508 --> 01:43:32.973
You are my brother.

1023
01:43:38.655 --> 01:43:39.584
Orm.

1024
01:43:42.659 --> 01:43:43.654
Let go.

1025
01:43:58.335 --> 01:43:59.769
Orm. let it go.

1026
01:44:19.258 --> 01:44:22.222
I live again!

1027
01:44:22.358 --> 01:44:26.393
I have waited
countless centuries
in the dark

1028
01:44:26.528 --> 01:44:28.435
for this moment.

1029
01:44:34.403 --> 01:44:35.772
Shit.

1030
01:44:43.313 --> 01:44:44.715
Arthur!

1031
01:46:11.005 --> 01:46:12.473
Never.

1032
01:46:20.409 --> 01:46:23.517
Arthur. we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

1033
01:46:38.497 --> 01:46:39.764
Let's get outta here!

1034
01:46:52.145 --> 01:46:53.871
Hurry!

1035
01:46:57.815 --> 01:46:59.613
That's right!

1036
01:46:59.749 --> 01:47:01.555
Come on. baby! Yeah!

1037
01:47:17.471 --> 01:47:21.036
Yeah!

1038
01:47:38.961 --> 01:47:39.956
My love.

1039
01:47:41.696 --> 01:47:44.026
- Hi. baby boy.

1040
01:47:53.536 --> 01:47:54.641
Shin.

1041
01:47:55.242 --> 01:47:56.577
Thank you.

1042
01:48:03.052 --> 01:48:04.314
Astounding.

1043
01:48:09.155 --> 01:48:12.586
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

1044
01:48:12.722 --> 01:48:13.720
Well. I'm not.

1045
01:48:13.856 --> 01:48:16.028
My claw got cut off.

1046
01:48:16.163 --> 01:48:17.224
Again!

1047
01:48:19.133 --> 01:48:20.232
You're one tough crustacean.
Your Highness.

1048
01:48:20.368 --> 01:48:21.568
Bah!

1049
01:48:21.704 --> 01:48:24.132
As far as I'm concerned.
your debt is paid.

1050
01:48:25.268 --> 01:48:27.542
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way though.

1051
01:48:32.048 --> 01:48:34.813
It's too bad you went
and had yourself killed
back there.

1052
01:48:36.646 --> 01:48:37.611
Yes.

1053
01:48:37.747 --> 01:48:39.114
All this ice.

1054
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:42.887
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

1055
01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.654
Just lay low
for a while.

1056
01:48:45.789 --> 01:48:47.991
But don't go too far.

1057
01:48:48.126 --> 01:48:49.928
I may need to call you up
for some advice.

1058
01:48:50.063 --> 01:48:53.161
You know. with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

1059
01:48:59.207 --> 01:49:00.300
Thank you...

1060
01:49:01.971 --> 01:49:03.842
brother.

1061
01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:21.024
You're not as bad at this
as you think.

1062
01:49:22.491 --> 01:49:25.699
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1063
01:49:26.733 --> 01:49:28.498
You are everything I was not.

1064
01:49:28.634 --> 01:49:31.804
You do the right thing
when doing the wrong
thing is much easier.

1065
01:49:32.905 --> 01:49:34.708
And you're willing
to ask for help

1066
01:49:35.642 --> 01:49:37.172
even from your worst enemy.

1067
01:49:39.041 --> 01:49:40.340
I know it may not feel like

1068
01:49:40.475 --> 01:49:42.316
you know what you're
doing sometimes. but...

1069
01:49:42.452 --> 01:49:44.749
keep trusting your instincts.

1070
01:49:44.885 --> 01:49:47.952
If you lead.
Atlantis will follow.

1071
01:49:51.091 --> 01:49:54.728
After all. a true king
builds bridges. right?

1072
01:49:55.797 --> 01:49:57.225
I thought that was just
a metaphor.

1073
01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:05.101
Well. your metaphor
might have just saved
the world's ass.

1074
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:30.430
<i>We've got breaking news.</i>

1075
01:50:30.566 --> 01:50:31.998
<i>We are witnessing history.</i>

1076
01:50:32.133 --> 01:50:34.301
<i>A moment the ramifications
of which simply...</i>

1077
01:50:34.437 --> 01:50:35.301
<i>cannot be overstated.</i>

1078
01:50:38.407 --> 01:50:39.763
<i>A first contact...</i>

1079
01:50:39.898 --> 01:50:41.403
<i>...with the undersea nation
of Atlantis.</i>

1080
01:50:41.539 --> 01:50:43.508
<i>An entire civilization hidden
for thousands of years</i>

1081
01:50:43.644 --> 01:50:45.244
<i>about to be revealed.</i>

1082
01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:52.917
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>

1083
01:50:53.053 --> 01:50:54.248
<i>the world
will never be the same.</i>

1084
01:50:54.383 --> 01:50:55.855
<i>The King of Atlantis</i>

1085
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:57.319
<i>has reached out
to the United Nations</i>

1086
01:50:57.454 --> 01:50:59.258
<i>and will be officially
seeking membership.</i>

1087
01:50:59.393 --> 01:51:00.527
<i>And is expected
to propose a joint effort</i>

1088
01:51:00.662 --> 01:51:02.160
<i>to reverse the climate issues.</i>

1089
01:51:02.296 --> 01:51:03.987
<i>We are
told that this was the result</i>

1090
01:51:04.123 --> 01:51:06.393
<i>of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.</i>

1091
01:51:06.529 --> 01:51:08.232
<i>We now go live to Ellis Island.</i>

1092
01:51:08.368 --> 01:51:10.167
<i>where the first official
ambassador from Atlantis</i>

1093
01:51:10.302 --> 01:51:12.806
<i>is about to address
the United Nations.</i>

1094
01:51:21.412 --> 01:51:24.912
I come here today as
a representative of two worlds.

1095
01:51:25.047 --> 01:51:27.485
The land and the sea.

1096
01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:35.185
<i>And I stand here as proof
that change is coming to both.</i>

1097
01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:40.999
<i>And I'm calling
for global unity
for a global crisis.</i>

1098
01:51:41.134 --> 01:51:43.100
<i>To finally bring harmony
between us</i>

1099
01:51:43.235 --> 01:51:46.203
<i>and the natural balance
of our world.</i>

1100
01:51:46.338 --> 01:51:48.069
<i>Atlantis stands ready
to help contribute</i>

1101
01:51:48.204 --> 01:51:50.404
<i>its science and technology.</i>

1102
01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.436
<i>And with your
knowledge of the air.</i>

1103
01:51:52.571 --> 01:51:54.245
<i>and our knowledge of the seas.</i>

1104
01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:57.450
<i>together we can write
the next chapter in our story.</i>

1105
01:51:57.586 --> 01:51:59.453
<i>rather than its ending.</i>

1106
01:51:59.589 --> 01:52:03.221
<i>Sometimes it's gonna seem
like our differences
are too extreme.</i>

1107
01:52:03.357 --> 01:52:06.817
<i>but all we have to do
is look beneath the surface.</i>

1108
01:52:06.952 --> 01:52:08.323
<i>to see that we're
all here on this planet</i>

1109
01:52:08.459 --> 01:52:10.996
<i>with the same goals
and aspirations.</i>

1110
01:52:11.132 --> 01:52:12.393
<i>- Even when our customs...</i>
- Here you go.

1111
01:52:12.528 --> 01:52:13.564
<i>...might seem strange
and unfamiliar.</i>

1112
01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:15.130
Beer and a cheeseburger.

1113
01:52:15.266 --> 01:52:17.464
Extra greasy
like you asked for.

1114
01:52:19.108 --> 01:52:21.373
<i>And by
overcoming our prejudices.</i>

1115
01:52:21.508 --> 01:52:24.775
<i>we'll become stronger and
learn more about ourselves.</i>

1116
01:52:24.911 --> 01:52:28.442
<i>We can seize this moment
to create a better
more hopeful future.</i>

1117
01:52:28.578 --> 01:52:32.281
<i>for our children.
and our families.</i>

1118
01:52:33.688 --> 01:52:35.521
<i>My name is Arthur Curry.</i>

1119
01:52:35.657 --> 01:52:39.493
<i>I'm the rightful sovereign
of the undersea nation
of Atlantis.</i>

1120
01:52:39.628 --> 01:52:41.526
<i>I'm a father. a brother.</i>

1121
01:52:41.662 --> 01:52:44.293
a warrior and a friend.

1122
01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:47.027
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1123
01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.166
