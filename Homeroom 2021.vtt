00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:38.165
Itzel. what do you think?

350
00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:40.292
‐ Okay. I said. I feel cool.

351
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.045
'cause when I'm playing another role.

352
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:46.423
it's like me switching up
or code switching kind of.

353
00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.217
TEACHER: I'm glad you‐‐
ITZEL: In my opinion.

354
00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:50.636
TEACHER: Say just a little bit
about what you mean by code switch.

355
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.515
‐ Like... kind of switching

356
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.935
from being yourself to being somebody else

357
00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.271
and changing. like. the way you're talking

358
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.398
or the way you're saying certain stuff.

359
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:05.734
TEACHER: Well. I'll say cool
back to you then.

360
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.777
[laughing]
TEACHER: 'Cause I'm glad

361
00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:07.819
that's how you feel about it.

362
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.821
'Cause that's part of what we are doing.

363
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.825
I mean. I heard. "No. no politics.
please." right. in here.

364
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.411
but we'll have to feel that out.

365
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.288
Like. our politics‐‐
ITZEL: No. I feel that. who said that?

366
00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.040
‐ Uh. I‐‐ Thank you for raising your hand.

367
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.166
I‐‐ See. between the two Itzels.

368
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.751
ITZEL: Politics is‐‐ Oh my god.

369
00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:24.837
TEACHER:
You agree about how bad it is.

370
00:17:24.837 --> 00:17:26.880
‐ So we're politics free in here. right?

371
00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:30.676
TEACHER: Not entirely. but we don't have
to specifically talk about now.

372
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.719
But questions about who's in charge

373
00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.180
and who has power and who doesn't.
that's already come up.

374
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.433
Right? So for example. remember we said.
who wants what? Right?

375
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.810
ITZEL: Mm‐hmm.
[phone vibrating]

376
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.186
TEACHER: Who wants to be free?

377
00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:44.648
ITZEL: What do you mean.
what's my problem?

378
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:48.151
‘Cause I just fucked up my mood. bro.

379
00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:51.864
Yeah. 'cause you just canceled on me.

380
00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:55.909
Hello?

381
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.832
Okay. like. this is the second time
you do this shit.

382
00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:06.336
Don't. don't call me no more.

383
00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.796
Don't call me no more.
Just leave me alone.

384
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.805
[indistinct chatter]

385
00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:22.352
[students chattering]

386
00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.355
[students laughing]

387
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.399
DENILSON: And Mr. Allan.
would have been like. "Wait a minute."

388
00:18:28.317 --> 00:18:30.485
GIRL: Not every day!
I'm just kidding.

389
00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.863
Alright. I can't be right here.

390
00:18:32.863 --> 00:18:35.699
But it is. you know. dry out there.

391
00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:40.370
BOY: Wait. what were you saying
about the board meeting?

392
00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:42.789
DENILSON: Yesterday. we had
a board meeting. right?

393
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.917
Now. it's this movement going on

394
00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:47.169
that's like "Oakland Is Not For Sale."
have you heard of them?

395
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:48.086
‐ Yeah.

396
00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:51.173
‐ They're like. you know.
advocating to stop the merge.

397
00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:53.342
to stop the closures and all of that.

398
00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:55.802
But it's just like the majority

399
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.846
are. like. white middle class people.

400
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.101
The last board meeting we had is
they just. like. completely shut it down.

401
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.812
And me and Mica.
we was just sitting there.

402
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.857
like. listening to them and. like.

403
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.527
I wanted to say it. like.
what I needed to say

404
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:14.530
but. like. a knot was in my. in my throat.

405
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.198
And it's like. if I say something.

406
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:18.575
like. I'm gonna‐‐
I'm gonna say it all.

407
00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:20.869
But it's like. we need to stay calm.

408
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:24.039
Because. like. what we say right now
is gonna be representing

409
00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.666
every 36.000 students.

410
00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:28.085
And. like. there's been many moments
where that had happened.

411
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:30.546
but it's always with the board. you know.
‐ Right.

412
00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.006
‐ Speaking to the board and speaking
to the community is different

413
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.676
because we don't want
to be against the community.

414
00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:36.260
‐ Right.

415
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.470
You still want to go in politics?

416
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.973
‐ Hell yeah. That's my passion. you know.

417
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.809
‐ You know. like. the Black Panthers
was founded in Oakland.

418
00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:48.021
And a lot of the things
that they fought for

419
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.150
were something simple.
to just access to education.

420
00:19:53.277 --> 00:19:55.195
And now you have had a front seat

421
00:19:55.654 --> 00:19:57.865
to the turmoil
that's been going on for years.

422
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:01.201
I feel like it was good
for that to happen to you.

423
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.454
Well. I feel like there's a different fire
that has been lit.

424
00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.166
But now you gotta go back
to the drawing board

425
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.544
and figure out how can you really get
that message across.

426
00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.045
and I'm positive and sure

427
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.047
that you will do everything you can
to figure that out.

428
00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:16.717
‐ Yeah.

429
00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:18.927
‐ Stay strong.

430
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.388
It's. it's. it's a hell of a fight.

431
00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:22.764
[laughing]

432
00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:25.142
BOY:
What'd I take? The SATs?

433
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:26.935
BOY 2: Yes.
‐ You're taking it or you already‐‐

434
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:27.936
BOY: No. I already took it.

435
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:28.896
‐ For real?
BOY: I'm not taking no more.

436
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:30.606
It's dumb. Oh yeah.
‐ Fuck that shit.

437
00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:31.815
[laughing]

438
00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:32.733
It's done with.

439
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.485
I do. I did. What is this?

440
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.905
Did we see that? Six hundred out of what?

441
00:20:38.864 --> 00:20:39.740
60.

442
00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.284
[laughing]

443
00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.078
EDGAR: Dude. you just put your name on it.
[laughs]

444
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.206
BOY: I don't care.

445
00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:49.291
400 is the minimum?

446
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.417
EDGAR: Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

447
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.211
‐ So if I got. like. 200.
it wouldn't even count.

448
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:54.505
EDGAR: Four hundred is.
I put my name on my thing.

449
00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:55.380
‐ What do you mean?

450
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.382
‐ You put your name on your application.

451
00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.550
I mean. that's it.
‐ And that's it.

452
00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:01.053
EDGAR: Yeah.
‐ I did that bad?

453
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.471
D.

454
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:03.889
[laughing]

455
00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:05.015
Are you serious?

456
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.852
What was your score?
‐ I got a 980.

457
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.188
It's bad.

458
00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:12.606
BOY:
I mean. it's better than what I did.

459
00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.358
‐ What'd you get at first?

460
00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:17.444
‐ I was... You got like a 830. right?

461
00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.571
Or 820. what did you get?
‐ No.

462
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.199
‐ I got like a 870.

463
00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:24.034
‐ Oh no. No. you didn't.

464
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.118
DENILSON: You're good then.

465
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.453
‐ You wanna see? How am I good?

466
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:30.707
DENILSON: Because. like. the average
of Ohio is like 900 I think.

467
00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:33.794
So...
‐ I lowered that average.

468
00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:36.088
DENILSON: [laughs] Same.

469
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:37.923
‐ Wait. what was it. what was it then?

470
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:38.966
‐ Huh?
‐ What was it?

471
00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.594
900. just plain 900?

472
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.096
‐ No. it's 900 something though.

473
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.099
‐ I went up 10 points. so that's‐‐

474
00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:48.976
DENILSON: I mean.
but your GPA makes up for it.

475
00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.352
‐ What's your GPA?
‐ What's your GPA?

476
00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.396
I got a 4.1 when I added everything in.

477
00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:53.355
DENILSON: You're good.

478
00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:56.650
I feel like if I had a 4.0.
then I'll be good with the SAT.

479
00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:58.944
But I'm. I don't even know.

480
00:21:58.944 --> 00:22:00.737
‐ Are you sure you're 3.8?

481
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:03.490
‐ I think.

482
00:22:05.868 --> 00:22:07.661
MAN: I'm putting all the information
right in front of you

483
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:10.747
so you can make
a logical decision on your future.

484
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.667
Hey. imagine though. if I really do this‐‐

485
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.044
if this entrepreneurship really.
like. sparked something.

486
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.213
I just start my own business
while in college.

487
00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:20.799
and then I just start making hella money.
I'm dropping out.

488
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.342
[laughing]

489
00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:26.013
I pray to God that happens.

490
00:22:26.513 --> 00:22:30.225
[students chattering]

491
00:22:34.897 --> 00:22:37.149
DWAYNE:
When I say A. you say CC.

492
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:38.233
A.
STUDENTS: CC

493
00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:39.610
‐ A.
STUDENTS: CC.

494
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.029
‐ Hello. everyone.
My name is Dwayne Davis.

495
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:44.448
I am vice president of ACC.

496
00:22:44.448 --> 00:22:46.158
Um. ACC is important to me

497
00:22:46.158 --> 00:22:48.535
because I love advocating
for the youth in Oakland.

498
00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:50.495
Go. Oakland.
Everybody from Oakland out here.

499
00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:52.080
[students snapping fingers]

500
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.874
And I believe that it's super important.

501
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.336
[students snapping]
‐ Yeah.

502
00:22:57.336 --> 00:22:59.755
‐ I would love for you guys
to come to a board meeting.

503
00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:01.632
'Cause I don't be seeing y'all faces.

504
00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:03.884
I don't be seeing young people. So...

505
00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:05.552
DENILSON:
We really want y'all to be there

506
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:08.847
because it will shift
the energy in the room. and‐‐

507
00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:10.766
You feel me? Like. me and Mica can't be

508
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.684
all of us versus them.

509
00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:13.810
[students snapping fingers]

510
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.187
So we need y'all's support.

511
00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:16.813
We need y'all to be there
and to be repping

512
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.774
for the youth in East and West Oakland.

513
00:23:18.774 --> 00:23:20.150
Like. we need that.

514
00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:22.736
BOY: Um. I had a question.

515
00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:25.531
So how are we making sure that we get
the voices of. you know. students

516
00:23:25.531 --> 00:23:28.992
that aren't in leadership classes

Out of one million police officers

695
00:33:15.537 --> 00:33:17.122
is it realistic to believe

that all one million are going
to have strong ethical

They see them everywhere.

And then. like. school is supposed
to be a safe place.

And then you see them there as well.

714

It's like being around them all the time.
It's. like. overwhelming.

Then it stops them
from wanting to go to school.

Um. I don't believe
in the abolition of police officers

1061
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:31.216
for a number of reasons.

1062
00:51:31.216 --> 00:51:33.552
because my. my uncle was

1063
00:51:33.552 --> 00:51:38.807

police officer in Raleigh. North Carolina.

1064

1717
01:23:24.213 --> 01:23:26.048
A saying that my father
always used to say.

1718
01:23:27.216 --> 01:23:29.051
I grew up in a place with limitations

1719
01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:32.888
from a family that wasn't fortunate
to go to school.

1720
01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:35.766
Come some circumstances that deprived us
from gaining knowledge.

1721
01:23:36.934 --> 01:23:38.310
Childhoods were erased.

1722
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:41.647
A plant grows into a tree.

1723
01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:43.315
It begins in the roots

1724
01:23:43.315 --> 01:23:45.943
and begins to expand its branches
and grows leaves.

1725
01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:48.028
Just like humans grow
from children to adults.

1726
01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:49.655
We begin to fit in.

1727
01:23:49.655 --> 01:23:52.241
The only ones who fit in
are the only ones who survive.

1728
01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:54.868
"Survival of the fittest."
like Darwin said.

1729
01:23:54.868 --> 01:23:56.662
"But what's the problem
with this." people ask.

1730
01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.122
I'll tell you what the problem is:

1731
01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:00.958
Roots are being cut

1732
01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:02.709
and branches are being grown too short.

1733
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:05.921
The leaves are falling off trees
as many stories go untold.

1734
01:24:05.921 --> 01:24:07.548
We begin to forget where we came from.

1735
01:24:07.548 --> 01:24:09.883
Las palabras‐‐
That's what our ancestors used to say.

1736
01:24:10.551 --> 01:24:13.095
Traditions aren't being thrown
and aren't being shown.

1737
01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:15.305
And if you didn't know.
you must let this be known.

1738
01:24:15.305 --> 01:24:16.849
before we lose our real throne.

1739
01:24:17.307 --> 01:24:19.852
You see. mom and dad
emphasized education so much

1740
01:24:19.852 --> 01:24:22.020
because they have experienced
not the American dream.

1741
01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.021
but the American nightmare.

1742
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.898
A dream that still haunts us to this day.

1743
01:24:24.898 --> 01:24:26.859
a dream that repeats itself over and over.

1744
01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:28.694
I close my eyes and it's still there.

1745
01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:32.739
I ask myself.
"Why is education so important?"

1746
01:24:33.615 --> 01:24:35.659
But I realized. I am the living answer.

1747
01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.202
I am the answer to this question.

1748
01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.663
Because education once showed
that I have the knowledge

1749
01:24:39.663 --> 01:24:41.540
to maneuver around this unknown puzzle

1750
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.917
filled with unjustices that‐‐
pieces that won't fit all the time.

1751
01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:46.461
Because they are never fitted
for me and my family.

1752
01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:50.132
But education will be the key
for me to reshape these pieces.

1753
01:24:50.132 --> 01:24:52.926
to reshape my future
and to uprise the seas.

1754
01:24:52.926 --> 01:24:54.261
to see the highest tides.

1755
01:24:54.261 --> 01:24:56.138
We'll tone down the people
that never believed in me

1756
01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:59.516
because I promised my mother
that I wouldn't be another statistic.

1757
01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:03.061
That my beautiful brown body
wouldn't be laying on the ground.

1759
01:25:06.398 --> 01:25:08.233
but I will not be another page
of the book.

1760
01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:09.735
I'll create a new chapter.

1761
01:25:09.735 --> 01:25:12.404
A chapter where I get to rise higher
than ever before.

1762
01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:15.199
a chapter of a young man sharing
his story up on stage
