you're gonna say. mom.

not rushing into this?

This is what I want.
I wanna be married.

don't want you to regret it

if it's not with
the right person.

be with your soulmate.

a serious talk with you.

- You must be a
pretty smart fella.

- Yeah. I guess
you can say that.

910
00:35:59.517 --> 00:36:03.310
- So the smart fella would
usually come to the father first

911

and ask for the daughter's
hand in marriage.

amazing daughter.

She's beautiful. bright.
ambitious. great personality.

I just couldn't wait any longer
to ask her to be my wife.

917

would've wanted it to go.

you gonna help me?

the appropriate bloom.

together after you're married?

1052
00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:25.310
- Keith?
- Yeah. is that his name?

1053
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.482
Okay.
- Oh. yeah.

1054
00:42:27.482 --> 00:42:29.379
Hey. how did you
know he was my ex?

1055
00:42:29.379 --> 00:42:31.896
- [laughing] Come on. I
know an ex when I see one.

1056
00:42:31.896 --> 00:42:33.896
They got a certain ex look.

1057
00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:35.586
- Yeah.
[both chuckling]

1058
00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:38.000
- Plus. he looked like
he wanted to kill me.

1059
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.172
- He probably thought
we was together.

1060
00:42:40.172 --> 00:42:41.827
I know he saw the ring.

1061
00:42:41.827 --> 00:42:43.068
- Oh. you think?

1062
00:42:43.068 --> 00:42:46.206
This is Carter with the.
Carter right here. yeah.

1063
00:42:46.206 --> 00:42:47.482
Yeah. I think you knew
what you was doing.

1064
00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:48.827
- [laughing] I did.

1065
00:42:48.827 --> 00:42:51.137
- So tell me about him.

1066
00:42:51.137 --> 00:42:52.655
- Tell you about him for what?

1067
00:42:52.655 --> 00:42:56.344
We just been together
for years back and forth.

1068
00:42:56.344 --> 00:42:59.000
I thought he was
the one. you know?

1069
00:43:00.206 --> 00:43:03.620
- I'm sorry. we can be
difficult sometimes.

1070
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.620
- Yeah.

1071
00:43:05.793 --> 00:43:07.448
I just couldn't
get him to commit.

1072
00:43:07.448 --> 00:43:11.413
He always made me feel like I
was just asking for too much.

1073
00:43:11.413 --> 00:43:12.931
You know?

1074
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:15.413
- In my experience. you
should never be with someone

1075
00:43:15.413 --> 00:43:18.103
that makes you feel like
you're asking too much.

1076
00:43:18.103 --> 00:43:20.965
because the right
person wouldn't make
you feel like that.

1077
00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:22.206
- Really?

1078
00:43:22.206 --> 00:43:23.827
- So the back and forth.
you know. I get it.

1079
00:43:23.827 --> 00:43:26.379
could be scary to put
yourself out there sometimes.

1080
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.655
but believe me when I tell you.

1081
00:43:29.655 --> 00:43:31.689
- What?
- A woman like you.

1082
00:43:31.689 --> 00:43:34.586
a man should be sure about.

1083
00:43:34.586 --> 00:43:35.724
- Oh. come on. really?

1084
00:43:36.896 --> 00:43:38.758
- Girl. listen.
if we were dating.

1085
00:43:38.758 --> 00:43:40.448
there would be no hesitation.

1086
00:43:40.448 --> 00:43:42.379
- Oh. come on.

1087
00:43:42.379 --> 00:43:44.413
- You are amazing.

1088
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.034
Fine as hell.

1089
00:43:46.034 --> 00:43:49.103
Cool and funny.

1090
00:43:49.103 --> 00:43:51.551
What man wouldn't
wanna lock you down?

1091
00:43:51.551 --> 00:43:52.793
Apparently Keith.

1092
00:43:52.793 --> 00:43:54.034
- Besides Keith.

1093
00:43:54.034 --> 00:43:55.793
Keith. he's got
issues. [laughing]

1094
00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:56.965
- [Trisha] He does.

1095
00:43:56.965 --> 00:43:58.103
- I'm just saying.
- What?

1096
00:43:58.103 --> 00:43:59.931
- Don't get hung up on one guy

1097
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:02.758
who doesn't see what
another man would in you.

1098
00:44:05.689 --> 00:44:06.758
- Okay.

1099
00:44:06.758 --> 00:44:08.000
- Okay?

1100
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.206
- You wanna help me
pick out some dresses?

1101
00:44:09.206 --> 00:44:10.379
Let's pick out some dresses.

1102
00:44:10.379 --> 00:44:11.482
Can we finish that drink first?

1103
00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.103
- Yeah.

1104
00:44:13.103 --> 00:44:14.620
I like your advice.

1105
00:44:15.448 --> 00:44:16.620
- I'm serious.

1106
00:44:17.896 --> 00:44:19.137
- Serious as hell.
- This is good. this is good.

1107
00:44:19.137 --> 00:44:19.965
- Good?

1108
00:44:23.448 --> 00:44:25.793
Come on already. I
need to see this dress.

1109
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.379
I'm turned around and
I got my eyes closed.

1110
00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:30.517
Oh. I hear it.
- No peeking.

1111
00:44:30.517 --> 00:44:31.689
- Okay. I have not.

1112
00:44:32.758 --> 00:44:35.206
- All right.
- Oh. yes!

1113
00:44:35.206 --> 00:44:36.827
- You like it?
- Yes.

1114
00:44:36.827 --> 00:44:39.206
Let me see it in
all it splendor.

1115
00:44:39.206 --> 00:44:40.862
Can I have a first dance?

1116
00:44:40.862 --> 00:44:42.862
Can we get some with it?

1117
00:44:42.862 --> 00:44:44.379
[Trisha laughing]
Oh. oh. all right!

1118
00:44:44.379 --> 00:44:45.482
Is that how we
doing with the snap?

1119
00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.827
Are we snapping over here?

1120
00:44:46.827 --> 00:44:47.758
Girl. let me see it again.

1121
00:44:47.758 --> 00:44:49.758
Let me see with the spin.

1122
00:44:49.758 --> 00:44:50.689
That is nice.

1123
00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:51.931
And then you going for the dip.

1124
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:53.275
Let me dip. let dip.

1125
00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:55.724
[Trisha screams]
Oh. I ain't gonna drop you.

1126
00:44:55.724 --> 00:44:56.931
- Please don't drop me.
- I won't drop you.

1127
00:44:56.931 --> 00:44:58.620
- Let me get one
more spin though.

1128
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.137
- All right.

1129
00:45:00.137 --> 00:45:02.103
- And then you drop me.
but don't drop me. dip me.

1130
00:45:02.103 --> 00:45:03.862
- All right. you ready?
You ready? You ready?

1131
00:45:03.862 --> 00:45:04.758
And then dip.

1132
00:45:04.758 --> 00:45:06.275
Don't drop.
[both laughing]

1133
00:45:06.275 --> 00:45:09.655
I said don't drop. I knew
you were gon' drop me.

1134
00:45:09.655 --> 00:45:12.241
[soft piano music]

1135
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:13.034
- Yeah.

1136
00:45:24.413 --> 00:45:27.379
[soft upbeat music]

1137
00:45:31.758 --> 00:45:34.413
[door knocking]

1138
00:45:35.586 --> 00:45:37.034
- Carter.

1139
00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:38.586
Carter. you gotta get up.

1140
00:45:38.586 --> 00:45:40.551
There's someone at the door.

1141
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.724
- Oh my God. I didn't
realize I fell asleep.

1142
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.172
See you later.

1143
00:45:48.827 --> 00:45:50.103
- Hey girl.

1144
00:45:50.103 --> 00:45:51.586
Don't oh. hey girl me.
like I didn't just see

1145
00:45:51.586 --> 00:45:52.931
some man running
outta your house.

1146
00:45:52.931 --> 00:45:54.758
- Oh girl. that was just Carter.

1147
00:45:54.758 --> 00:45:56.275
- Carter?
- Yes.

1148
00:45:56.275 --> 00:45:57.793
I thought you were marrying Ben.

1149
00:45:57.793 --> 00:46:00.206
- I am. he's just
Ben's assistant.

1150
00:46:00.206 --> 00:46:01.827
He was just coming
over here to help me.

1151
00:46:01.827 --> 00:46:03.172
- Hmm.

1152
00:46:03.172 --> 00:46:04.793
- What? What's hmm?

1153
00:46:04.793 --> 00:46:07.655
Trust me. it's not
even like that.

1154
00:46:07.655 --> 00:46:09.172
[chuckling] You know what?

1155
00:46:09.172 --> 00:46:11.241
You're not gonna believe what
happened to me yesterday.

1156
00:46:11.241 --> 00:46:12.620
- What happened yesterday?

1157
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.448
- I ran into Keith.

1158
00:46:14.448 --> 00:46:15.620
- Where?

1159
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.655
- At the cafe with Carter.

1160
00:46:17.655 --> 00:46:19.137
- And how was that?

1161
00:46:19.137 --> 00:46:21.862
And why are you and Ben's
assistant having lunch together

1162
00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:24.517
and waking up the morning
after together too?

1163
00:46:24.517 --> 00:46:26.655
- I told you. he's helping
me with the wedding.

1164
00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:27.862
And Keith wanted to know

1165
00:46:27.862 --> 00:46:29.724
why I hadn't returned
his phone calls.

1166
00:46:30.931 --> 00:46:31.931
- What did you do?

1167
00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:35.655
- I didn't know what to do.
so I just introduced them.

1168
00:46:37.724 --> 00:46:39.724
Keith wasn't feeling it.

1169
00:46:39.724 --> 00:46:41.896
He really looked hurt.

1170
00:46:41.896 --> 00:46:45.655
- Well. you moved on. sort of.

1171
00:46:45.655 --> 00:46:48.068
and. plus. you said you
were done with him. so.

1172
00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:49.517
- I know.

1173
00:46:49.517 --> 00:46:51.551
And Carter and I talked when
we got back to my place.

1174
00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:53.068
and you know what. girl?

1175
00:46:53.068 --> 00:46:54.758
He made me feel so much better.

1176
00:46:54.758 --> 00:46:56.137
- Hmm.

1177
00:46:56.137 --> 00:46:57.793
- He's really a sweetheart.

1178
00:46:57.793 --> 00:47:00.000
- Let me find out. you're
getting over your ex

1179
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.413
by sleeping with your
fake husband's assistant.

1180
00:47:02.413 --> 00:47:05.862
- Absolutely not. we just
hung out a few times.

1181
00:47:05.862 --> 00:47:08.517
- I'm just saying you had
that look in your eyes.

1182
00:47:08.517 --> 00:47:10.206
- What? No!

1183
00:47:11.413 --> 00:47:12.827
Well. hopefully
when it's all over.

1184
00:47:12.827 --> 00:47:14.448
you can leave Keith behind.

1185
00:47:14.448 --> 00:47:15.275
- Exactly.

1186
00:47:16.344 --> 00:47:19.793
That's the plan.
[door knocking]

1187
00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:21.413
Oh. more company.

1188
00:47:21.413 --> 00:47:23.206
Can you get that? I
gotta get dressed.

1189
00:47:31.413 --> 00:47:34.000
- Oh. what's up. Steph?

1190
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.379
- Hey. JJ.

1191
00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:36.241
How you doing?

1192
00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:37.655
- You know. I'm alright.

1193
00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:40.413
I could be doing so much
better if you gave me a chance.

1194
00:47:40.413 --> 00:47:41.482
- A chance at what?

1195
00:47:41.482 --> 00:47:42.655
- You know.

1196
00:47:42.655 --> 00:47:43.793
- Ew!

1197
00:47:43.793 --> 00:47:45.241
Leave her alone.

1198
00:47:45.241 --> 00:47:47.241
- You know. you're practically
my little brother. right?

1199
00:47:47.241 --> 00:47:49.862
- See. look. why you gotta
go and ruin it like that?

1200
00:47:50.724 --> 00:47:52.827
But Steph?
- Yeah.

1201
00:47:52.827 --> 00:47:55.620
- So you know about
this Ben guy. right?

1202
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.896
- Yeah. why?

1203
00:47:56.896 --> 00:47:58.068
- 'Cause he's marrying my sister

1204
00:47:58.068 --> 00:47:59.344
and I don't know much about him.

1205
00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:00.793
- What do you need
to know about him?

1206
00:48:00.793 --> 00:48:02.068
- A lot!

1207
00:48:02.068 --> 00:48:03.310
'Cause what? Some guy
just comes outta nowhere

1208
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.827
and now you're marrying him?

1209
00:48:04.827 --> 00:48:06.758
That's kind the weird. sis.
you know what I'm saying?

1210
00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:09.275
- Hey!
- I don't understand it.

1211
00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:11.413
- Okay. I'll let you
two get caught up.

1212
00:48:13.482 --> 00:48:15.137
That was close. [laughing]

1213
00:48:15.137 --> 00:48:17.034
- I know. I wonder
why he's asking

1214
00:48:17.034 --> 00:48:18.620
all these questions
all of a sudden.

1215
00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.620
- I mean. I kind of get it.

1216
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.620
This all happened out
nowhere. and it's fake.

1217
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.310
[Trisha shushes]
My bad.

1218
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.241
Keep your cool. keep it down.

1219
00:48:27.275 --> 00:48:29.034
You know how nosy he is.

1220
00:48:29.034 --> 00:48:30.724
- He's just gonna
keep asking questions.

1221
00:48:30.724 --> 00:48:33.448
[doorbell rings]

1222
00:48:33.448 --> 00:48:34.275
- Carter?

1223
00:48:40.965 --> 00:48:42.379
- Hey. I didn't know
if you had food.

1224
00:48:42.379 --> 00:48:44.793
so I brought you some. some.

1225
00:48:44.793 --> 00:48:47.241
- Aw. how sweet!

Nice to meet you. I'm
Stephanie. the best friend.

- Nice to meet you.

1228

- Look. I'm just
gonna get going.

00:48:52.068 --> 00:48:53.068
Bye. Carter.

1230
00:48:53.068 --> 00:48:55.448
- Whoa. which one is this one?

1231
00:48:55.448 --> 00:48:57.724
- That's Carter.
- Who the hell is Carter?

1232
00:48:57.724 --> 00:48:58.620
- This one?

1233
00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.896
- Look. I'm her brother. JJ.

1234
00:49:02.827 --> 00:49:04.034
Look. sis. I don't
know what type

1235
00:49:04.034 --> 00:49:05.620
of freaky thing you
got going on over here.

1236
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.448
but I'm telling mom and dad.

1237
00:49:07.448 --> 00:49:10.000
And thank you for the sandwich.

[soft piano music]

1239
00:49:24.448 --> 00:49:25.965
- What's going on?

1240
00:49:28.034 --> 00:49:30.862
- I think I'm just
in over my head.

1241
00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.551
I don't know what's going on.

1242
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:38.551
I mean. I always wanted
the perfect wedding.

1243
00:49:38.551 --> 00:49:40.689
and Ben is making
that possible for me.

1244
00:49:40.689 --> 00:49:43.344
but I always loved Keith.

1245
00:49:44.379 --> 00:49:45.551
and I wanted to marry him.

1246
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:47.931
but obviously he
doesn't feel the same.

1247
00:49:47.931 --> 00:49:49.689
- Can I ask you a question?

1248
00:49:49.689 --> 00:49:51.034
- Yeah. what?

1249
00:49:51.034 --> 00:49:53.448
- How do you know
that you loved him?

1250
00:49:53.448 --> 00:49:54.827
- Who? Keith?
- Mm-hm.

1251
00:49:56.275 --> 00:49:58.310
- I don't know. we just
been together for so long.

1252
00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:01.931
I'm just used to having
him around. [chuckles]

1253
00:50:03.448 --> 00:50:06.034
I mean. can I ask
you a question?

1254
00:50:06.034 --> 00:50:07.137
What about you?

1255
00:50:08.137 --> 00:50:10.517
Have you ever been in love?

1256
00:50:10.517 --> 00:50:12.172
- Yeah.

1257
00:50:12.172 --> 00:50:13.000
Yeah.

1258
00:50:14.482 --> 00:50:18.689
I once read somewhere
that you are sleeping

1259
00:50:18.689 --> 00:50:21.344
'til you fall in love.

1260
00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:23.517
And at first. I didn't
know what that meant.

1261
00:50:25.517 --> 00:50:26.517
Then I met someone.

1262
00:50:29.551 --> 00:50:32.206
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.

1263
00:50:32.206 --> 00:50:34.172
I couldn't do anything.
but think of her.

1264
00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:37.000
At night. I dreamt of her.

1265
00:50:38.517 --> 00:50:40.931
When I woke up. all day I
couldn't wait to see her.

1266
00:50:46.517 --> 00:50:48.448
And when I did see her.

1267
00:50:50.862 --> 00:50:52.103
my heart turned over.

1268
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:57.310
And I was filled with desire.

00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:51.724
Hey.

1271
00:51:54.103 --> 00:51:56.896
Good morning.

1272
00:51:56.896 --> 00:51:58.413
- Good morning.

1273
00:51:58.413 --> 00:52:00.034
- You okay?

1274
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:03.310
- Carter. what happened
last night was a mistake.

1275
00:52:04.758 --> 00:52:07.068
My emotions were all mixed
up after seeing Keith.

1276
00:52:07.068 --> 00:52:09.413
and it should
never happen again.

1277
00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:10.862
- Okay. wait.

1278
00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:13.620
Are you saying that
there's nothing between us?

1279
00:52:14.724 --> 00:52:16.689
- No. I'm sorry.

1280
00:52:16.689 --> 00:52:19.206
Look. we should just focus
on planning the wedding.

1281
00:52:20.344 --> 00:52:21.931
Carter. you're a
really good friend.

1282
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:24.000
but I can't handle
anything else.

[gentle music]

1284
00:52:28.241 --> 00:52:29.068
- I don't get it.

1285
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:33.241
You spend all this
time searching for
someone to love you.

1286
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:34.482
and now that you have it.

1287
00:52:35.689 --> 00:52:37.413
you're just gonna
let him walk away.

Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

I need to talk to you.

1295

- About us.

- We've been over this.
I told you we're done.

with you and that guy.

I want us to be together.

- Since when?

1304
00:53:21.655 --> 00:53:24.413
- Since always. I just
didn't know how to do that.

1305
00:53:24.413 --> 00:53:26.413
- And all of a sudden you do?

1306
00:53:26.413 --> 00:53:28.379
Why. because I'm with
someone else now?

1307
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:29.896
- Who cares why?

1308
00:53:29.896 --> 00:53:31.517
All I know is that I can't
stop thinking about you

1309
00:53:31.517 --> 00:53:33.068
and how bad I messed up.

1310

over and over again.

And I know I don't deserve
another chance. baby.

tonight. that's all I'm asking.

why I called you.

want. the guy I chose

do you like Carter?

Like. actually like him?

1337

- I like the idea of him.

1338
00:54:52.448 --> 00:54:57.379
He's romantic and caring and.
you know. he really sees me.

1339
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.758
- But you've already
agreed to marry Ben

1340
00:55:00.758 --> 00:55:02.517
and signed the contract.

1341
00:55:02.517 --> 00:55:03.413
- Right.

1342

- Well.
- Well what.

1344
00:55:07.724 --> 00:55:09.551
- At least it won't
be a real marriage.

1345
00:55:09.551 --> 00:55:11.517
and it'll only last a year.

1346
00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:12.793
- Yeah.

1347
00:55:12.793 --> 00:55:14.448
I like the idea of a wedding.

1348
00:55:14.448 --> 00:55:16.758
but I just wish I can
get rid of all these men.

1349
00:55:17.931 --> 00:55:19.344
- What about Keith?

1350
00:55:19.344 --> 00:55:21.034
You said you were done with him.

1351

- I was. I mean. I
am. I don't know.

1352
00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:27.482
He just sounded so sincere.

1353

plus. we've been
together for so long.

down this road
with Keith before?

I mean. he's the whole
reason you're doing

stuff to begin with.

1358
00:55:37.517 --> 00:55:38.310
- Yeah.

1359

Well. Keith and I have a
lot of history together.

1360
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:46.000
I guess I'm not ready to let
him go. like I thought I was.

with when the wifi goes out?

have a decision to make.

it or even admit it to myself.

That's all I ever wanted
was to know how you felt

1392

and what I meant to you.

couldn't give that to you.

Who could this be? [groans]

1399

- Trisha. just
coming to see you.

1401
00:57:47.517 --> 00:57:50.241
Calling the phone. you wasn't
answering. and I got worried.

1402
00:57:51.827 --> 00:57:53.413
I guess there's no need to be.

1403
00:57:55.172 --> 00:57:57.620
- [Trisha] Keith and I.
we were just talking.

1404

- [Ben] Talking?

1405
00:57:58.586 --> 00:57:59.793
Looks more like a date to me.

1406

- [Trisha] No.

1407
00:58:02.068 --> 00:58:03.137

- He's gonna call you later?

1409

What's going on with that?

1410

- What are you doing here?

1411
00:58:12.068 --> 00:58:13.413
- I told you I was
coming to see you.

1412
00:58:13.413 --> 00:58:16.241
- Since when have you
wanted to see me. huh?

1413
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:17.862
You haven't been
interested in anything.

1414
00:58:17.862 --> 00:58:20.517
- Okay. I haven't been involved
in a lot. but who cares?

1415
00:58:20.517 --> 00:58:21.827
I'm paying for everything.

1416
00:58:21.827 --> 00:58:23.827
- That's not the point.
- No. that is the point.

1417
00:58:23.827 --> 00:58:25.586
I'm footing the bill to give
you the wedding of your dreams.

1418

and you out here
dating other dudes?

1419
00:58:27.862 --> 00:58:30.000
- I'm not dating other
dudes. that's just my ex.

1420
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.827
and we have a lot of history.

1421
00:58:30.827 --> 00:58:32.793
I don't care. Trisha.

1422
00:58:33.965 --> 00:58:35.655
I don't want you
seeing him again.

1423
00:58:35.655 --> 00:58:36.862
- You can't tell me what to do.

1424
00:58:36.862 --> 00:58:38.172
You know what?

1425
00:58:38.172 --> 00:58:42.137

for this. goodnight.

[soft piano music]

1429
00:58:55.068 --> 00:58:56.379
- Keith and I have history

1430
00:58:56.379 --> 00:58:58.310
and a connection
that I can't deny.

1431
00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.413
Even though I can't
stand him sometimes.

1432
00:59:00.413 --> 00:59:03.482
I really feel like he
wants to change for me.

1433
00:59:03.482 --> 00:59:07.103
Ben could actually give me my
dream wedding with no problem.

1434
00:59:07.103 --> 00:59:10.586
but I don't have any
real feelings for him.

1435
00:59:10.586 --> 00:59:12.068
It wouldn't be fair
for either of us.

1436
00:59:12.068 --> 00:59:13.551
but then there's Carter.

1437
00:59:13.551 --> 00:59:16.310
Carter could actually
be the perfect guy.

1438
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:18.655
but I don't know if
he's the one for me.

real feelings for him.

your fault. Keith.

- My fault? How
is this my fault?

with my head for years now.

Yeah. and I'm marrying
you. so why I gotta leave?

get so messed up?

you can do now is

of knowing that.
