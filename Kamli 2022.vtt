00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.708
<i>“The desire of union</i>

4
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.791
<i>with my beloved was intense.</i>

5
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.875
<i>My little world was full</i>

6
00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.875
<i>of joy and happiness.</i>

7
00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:37.708
<i>It was the eve of our union.</i>

8
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:42.958
<i>It was exceptional and very special.</i>

9
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:44.708
<i>My arms. flesh...</i>

10
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.583
<i>and bones simmered</i>

11
00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:52.250
<i>In the heat of our heavy breaths.</i>

12
00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.458
<i>The scorching heat of summer</i>

13
00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:58.708
<i>turned both of us pale. yellow</i>

14
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:02.166
<i>Me and Amaltas.”</i>

15
00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.958
<i>This poem has been sent to us</i>

16
00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:05.916
<i>by our regular and favorite caller</i>

17
00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:07.875
<i>Anjum Qureshi.</i>

18
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:09.875
<i>You may know her as a famous poet</i>

19
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.083
<i>who often sends her poems to us.</i>

20
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.166
<i>One of her poems</i>

21
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.250
<i>you all request for a lot</i>

22
00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:18.166
<i>and I present it to you again!</i>

23
00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.583
<i>“I see daisies in my sight</i>

24
00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:23.041
<i>What happened between us last night</i>

25
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.500
<i>I wish would happen again tonight.”</i>

26
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.083
<i>You are listening to your favorite RJ</i>

27
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:32.000
<i>Sahir Beragi on “Wanderers of the Night.”</i>

28
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.958
<i>The next request is by</i>

29
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:35.833
<i>Allahrakha Bashir</i>

30
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:39.500
<i>from Khab... errr... Khabekhi Lake.</i>

31
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.791
<i>He requests a song in Reshma's voice...</i>

32
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.291
Come. children. come!

33
00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.041
Come take the sweets!

34
00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.291
Say it louder!

35
00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.541
Louder!

36
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.083
Come. children. come!

37
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.833
Come take the sweets!

38
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.166
He'll gather them.

39
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.375
I've told Ahmad

40
00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:04.916
our honeymoon should last a month.

41
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.416
I don't want to look at his

42
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.250
family's faces right after the wedding.

43
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.625
You actually said that?

44
00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:10.875
Of course!

45
00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.375
He should get used to my orders.

46
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.250
His mother was saying that

47
00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.250
we should go to his uncle in Karachi.

48
00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:19.541
I said there's no way

49
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.500
that I would go to Karachi! Never!

50
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.416
All that humidity!

51
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.625
But I've sorted it with Ahmad.

52
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.875
We'll go to Murree!

53
00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:28.875
To see the snowfall!

54
00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.000
Hey!

55
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.916
Tell me

56
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.500
which outfit suits him best?

57
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.500
This golden one.

58
00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.500
I like this one too.

59
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.333
Hello sister!

60
00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:48.000
Hello. hello!

61
00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:49.916
Here you go.

62
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.375
Here. take it. One by one.

63
00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:54.666
Why are you taking two?

64
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.916
One is for my sister

65
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
she is sick and is at home.

66
00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.750
Okay. make sure you give it to her.

67
00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:00.958
If you eat it yourself

68
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.500
tapeworms will bite your ass.

69
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.375
Its amazing how

70
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.750
Sister Sakina never forgets to prepare

71
00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.791
this dessert on Saqlain's birthday.

72
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.125
Yes because

73
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.625
he has forgotten us so dutifully.

74
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.833
It's on us to never forget him.

75
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.250
Run now. it's finished.

76
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.708
<i>Your daughter didn't go to school?</i>

77
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.166
<i>She is unwell.</i>

78
00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:25.559
Sister we've distributed the sweets

79
00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:26.875
only the mosque is left now.

80
00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:28.083
Yes. just preparing

81
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.916
the dish for the mosque.

82
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.875
I feel so sad when I look at Hina.

83
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:37.166
So young and beautiful...

84
00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:39.416
and look at her fate.

85
00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:41.291
It’s been seven or eight years

86
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.125
right. since he left?

87
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.500
<i>Shhh... Hina!</i>

88
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.041
<i>Just praise Sakina's cooking!</i>

89
00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:54.125
<i>Sakina. the dessert is perfect!</i>

90
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:56.375
<i>Did Hina hear us?</i>

91
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.333
<i>No. you were not that loud.</i>

92
00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:00.833
<i>He went to find a job. right?</i>

93
00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:03.583
<i>I think there is something fishy...</i>

94
00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:04.791
<i>Saqlain must have</i>

95
00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:06.125
<i>married a foreigner there.</i>

96
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.666
<i>Seems like it.</i>

97
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:09.625
<i>I don't think he will ever come back.</i>

98
00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:12.333
<i>This house gives me the horrors.</i>

99
00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:22.166
Sister-in-law

100
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.166
do you remember

101
00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:26.666
how fond Saqlain is of the rain?

102
00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.625
I can't forget the day

103
00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:33.000
when you both got lost.

104
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.791
We went into the jungle

105
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.750
to catch tadpoles.

106
00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.791
Papa left immediately in the rain

107
00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:44.458
on his motorcycle

108
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.583
to look for you both.

109
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.958
Mother was praying so loudly

110
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.375
in the courtyard.

111
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:55.875
I thought it's the end of the world!

112
00:07:56.791 --> 00:07:59.791
When uncle finally found us

113
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.875
I thought he would scold us.

114
00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:07.250
But he hugged us and kept crying.

115
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.708
That’s because

116
00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:10.166
mother kept yelling at him

117
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.708
that he would be responsible

118
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.500
if anything happens

119
00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:15.791
to her sister's orphaned child.

120
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.875
It will get better. sister-in-law.

121
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.833
When Saqlain comes back

122
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.708
it will get better...

123
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:27.375
like it used to be.

124
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.958
Where are you going?

125
00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:42.250
Just a second.

126
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.958
Sister-in-law?

127
00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:14.791
Sister-in-law?

128
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.708
Look. a kitten!

129
00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.541
It was getting drenched in the rain.

130
00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:27.750
Its mother has ran off.

131
00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.041
It's okay

132
00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:34.500
It's okay my child.

133
00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:40.416
It's okay... It's okay.

134
00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:43.625
I was leaving.

135
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.500
Leaving for pilgrimage?

136
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:47.666
There was no need

137
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.625
for this elaborate farewell.

138
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.416
You startled my girls.

139
00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:57.875
I knew you'd be happy to see me.

140
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:00.666
Ah!

141
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.750
Your star subject!

142
00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:12.958
Stunning!

143
00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.125
Its coming along very well.

144
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.875
Go give it to her.

145
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:40.416
Ma’am. mother has sent this for you.

146
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.250
Thank you.

147
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:43.958
But what is it?

148
00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.083
It's a... a medicine.

149
00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.333
Its very good.

150
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:50.791
Okay.

151
00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.166
Her mother makes it herself.

152
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.833
I gave it to my cousin too.

153
00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:57.083
She was childless for ten years.

154
00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:59.833
But last year she had twins!

155
00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.666
You should take one

156
00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:03.833
spoonful every morning.

157
00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:04.750
God willing

158
00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:07.416
Mr Malik will have an heir soon.

159
00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:20.583
Idiot!

160
00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:21.726
You were giving fertility medicines

161
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.041
to Ma’am in front of everyone?

162
00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:25.416
How else should I have given it?

163
00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.166
I don't think its going to work on Ma’am.

164
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:31.041
I think she has hit menopause.

165
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.333
Yeah yeah. blame it all on her.

166
00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:36.291
I suspect Mr Malik.

167
00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:40.291
We'll all be in trouble

168
00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:42.208
if somebody hears us.

169
00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:45.125
How old do you think she is?

170
00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.583
Mmm...

171
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:49.375
<i>She is very well maintained</i>

172
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.041
<i>but definitely around fifty.</i>

173
00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:55.458
<i>Can you get pregnant at this age?</i>

174
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:05.125
Three large batteries please.

175
00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:06.416
Okay.

176
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.666
Here you go.

177
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.958
Four packets of washing powder too.

178
00:14:58.166 --> 00:15:00.000
<i>Water!</i>

179
00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:06.208
<i>What sorcery is this?</i>

180
00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:10.583
<i>Water!</i>

181
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:16.458
<i>Water rising to the skies.</i>

182
00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:26.916
<i>Water burning like flames.</i>

183
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:34.958
<i>Water flooding the desert.</i>

184
00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:39.875
<i>Water!</i>

185
00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:45.875
<i>Water casting spells!</i>

186
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:56.791
<i>Water rising to the skies!</i>

187
00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:15.083
<i>Water wrapping my feet like chains...</i>

188
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.083
<i>Water stifling me...</i>

189
00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:20.833
<i>Water scribbling words on my body...</i>

190
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.291
<i>Water erasing everything.</i>

191
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:28.625
<i>It is pushing its way through...</i>

192
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:33.976
<i>Dreamily. slithering. creeping...</i>

193
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.041
<i>Dreamily. slithering. creeping</i>

194
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:39.291
<i>Who knows what it will do?</i>

195
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.125
<i>Water!</i>

196
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:47.208
<i>Magical water!</i>

197
00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:58.125
<i>Water rising to the skies!</i>

198
00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:19.250
<i>How my heart sinks!</i>

199
00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:24.583
<i>How it rises again!</i>

200
00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:27.083
<i>Where is this heart of mine</i>

201
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.083
<i>sweeping me off to?</i>

202
00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:35.375
<i>Leaving everything behind...</i>

203
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.875
<i>Leaving behind</i>

204
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.625
<i>acquaintances and strangers alike...</i>

205
00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:42.875
<i>What will this moment</i>

206
00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.916
<i>frozen in time reveal?</i>

207
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.333
<i>Will it stay this way forever?</i>

208
00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:53.250
<i>Water!</i>

209
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:59.500
<i>What sorcery is this?</i>

210
00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:09.666
<i>Magical water!</i>

211
00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:20.291
<i>Water casting spells!</i>

212
00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:31.250
<i>Water rising to the heavens!</i>

213
00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:34.166
Sister-in-law?

214
00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:36.541
What are you doing?

215
00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.250
Just changing clothes.

216
00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.208
I spilled some paint accidentally.

217
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:42.750
Hmm...

218
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.416
Did you bring the groceries?

219
00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:50.166
Yes.

220
00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.351
You didn't forget the batteries. right?

221
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:53.791
Nope.

222
00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:08.833
Actually...

223
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.416
I forgot them sister.

224
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:14.208
I'll get them tomorrow.

225
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:22.458
Once there was a star

226
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:24.041
who fell madly in love

227
00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.458
with a lost traveller.

228
00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:28.193
The traveller would walk endlessly

229
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.916
during the day.

230
00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:31.458
And at night

231
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:33.250
he would fall asleep

232
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:35.541
on the cool desert sand.

233
00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:41.041
The moonlight reflecting on him

234
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:46.583
against the silver sand

235
00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:51.375
mesmerised the star.

236
00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:56.958
She would keep looking at him

237
00:20:57.083 --> 00:21:00.083
till the first beams of the sun.

238
00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:03.708
And throughout the day

239
00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:06.166
lost in the bright sunlight

240
00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:08.708
the star would wait for night time.

241
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:14.958
And then one night

242
00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:19.083
some very dense clouds came by.

243
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:25.583
The star couldn't see the traveller.

244
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:31.208
She begged the clouds to move

245
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.541
but they didn't budge.

246
00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:39.208
She cried and threatened the clouds

247
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.958
but they were very stubborn.

248
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.333
Then. helplessly

249
00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:48.541
the star called to the wind

250
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:53.791
to blow away the clouds.

251
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:57.000
The wind felt sorry for the star

252
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:59.291
and decided to help her.

253
00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:01.958
And it blew all the clouds away

254
00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:04.416
in a single breath.

255
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:08.916
When the clouds parted

256
00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:10.791
the star saw something...

257
00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:13.583
Her traveller was lying dead

258
00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:17.541
on the desert sand.

259
00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:24.458
The clouds were protecting her

260
00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.916
from this painful truth.

261
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.208
Hina?

262
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.125
Are you okay?

263
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.500
Yeah.

264
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:21.458
Are you sure?

265
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.541
If there's any problem

266
00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:27.333
you can tell me.

267
00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:30.625
No there isn't...

268
00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:34.208
just the usual.

269
00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:38.083
Hina. exchange this with me?

270
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.458
Ma’am gave me yellow last time too.

271
00:23:40.708 --> 00:23:42.416
Please take this?

272
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.083
Thank you.

273
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.000
My name is Amaltas.

274
00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:07.875
I'm a photographer.

275
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:12.083
And if I like something...

276
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:15.791
I capture it.

277
00:26:27.708 --> 00:26:28.875
You can tell me your name too

278
00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:30.375
when you come again.

279
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:34.083
<i>Sometimes I think that love</i>

280
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:36.083
<i>is like a pack of cigarettes</i>

281
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.541
<i>which comes with a health warning</i>

282
00:26:38.666 --> 00:26:41.375
<i>and a horrifying picture on it.</i>

283
00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:43.916
<i>But there's no such thing</i>

284
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.166
<i>on the box of love.</i>

285
00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:46.791
<i>Nobody warns you</i>

286
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.250
<i>about what's to come.</i>

287
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.125
<i>And lovers. just like moths</i>

288
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:51.750
<i>are drawn to the flame.</i>

289
00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:53.125
<i>They jump into the fire</i>

290
00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:54.416
<i>and believe that they've found</i>

291
00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:57.166
<i>something incredible and everlasting</i>

292
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.583
<i>believing that to get destroyed</i>

293
00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:03.625
<i>is the highest level of love.</i>

294
00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:07.041
<i>Love is love. and love is life!</i>

295
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:08.708
Don't you trust me. sister?

296
00:27:08.833 --> 00:27:10.166
I have counted very carefully.

297
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.708
I trust you

298
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:15.416
but its better to double-check.

299
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.916
Check. check. sure.

300
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.041
I was thinking to give you

301
00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:20.916
the next season's payment too.

302
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:22.000
Next payment will be made

303
00:27:22.083 --> 00:27:23.291
next season only.

304
00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:26.125
Let the soil breathe for a bit.

305
00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.041
As you wish.

306
00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:29.708
Let the soil breathe

307
00:27:29.875 --> 00:27:31.125
while we run out of air.

308
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.541
Uh-ho. he just wants his share.

309
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:34.625
Hello. Sakina!

310
00:27:34.666 --> 00:27:35.458
Hello.

311
00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:37.000
You've lost so much weight?

312
00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:38.500
You didn't get dengue again?

313
00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:39.916
For God's sake. aunty!

314
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.375
Say something nice for once.

315
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.000
You tell. everything good?

316
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.916
I'm good. you tell?

317
00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:46.416
Is that a no?

318
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.166
We'll talk later. Usman. bye.

319
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:51.666
Naseem. come inside.

320
00:27:51.916 --> 00:27:53.875
Bye. as you wish.

321
00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:55.541
There’s no invitation card

322
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:56.958
for the recepion

323
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.791
but you both have to come.

324
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.208
Where did I put it?

325
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:03.875
Oh. here it is.

326
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.125
It says Sakina.

327
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.791
And this...

328
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:16.291
this is your party dress!

329
00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:18.541
Party dress?

330
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:21.083
What was the need for these

331
00:28:21.208 --> 00:28:23.333
stupid. extravagant traditions.

332
00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:25.583
Go and explain this to her...

333
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.333
she got dresses for five friends.

334
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.041
There is extra cloth in this too

335
00:28:31.208 --> 00:28:32.916
if you need to alter something.

336
00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:34.166
Thank you. Aunty.

337
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.166
Read properly!

338
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:43.333
Should I tell sister?

339
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:48.500
Sakina...

340
00:28:48.833 --> 00:28:50.916
you should think about her too.

341
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:54.458
What?

342
00:28:54.625 --> 00:28:56.625
What do I need to think?

343
00:28:57.708 --> 00:28:58.583
Look...

344
00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:00.791
doesn't matter what people say

345
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:03.208
but we're answerable to God.

346
00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:05.500
Had Saqlain kept in touch

347
00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:06.625
it would be different.

348
00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:07.958
But there’s no news of him

349
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:09.083
since he left.

350
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:10.625
Why have you kept her

351
00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.458
tethered like a goat?

352
00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:14.916
Decide something about her.

353
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:17.166
She is getting older.

354
00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:20.375
You can't see but I can!

355
00:29:20.833 --> 00:29:23.041
She is losing her youth.

356
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:25.083
So what should I do?

357
00:29:25.166 --> 00:29:27.458
What are you trying to say?

358
00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:29.000
Should I get her married

359
00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:30.541
<i>while she is already married?</i>

360
00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:32.458
<i>Should I commit such a sin?</i>

361
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:34.166
<i>If your brother doesn't return</i>

362
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.041
<i>for the next twenty years</i>

363
00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:38.166
<i>will she keep waiting like this?</i>

364
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:39.916
<i>Why won't he come back?</i>

365
00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:41.333
<i>Are you wishing ill for us?</i>

366
00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:42.458
<i>God. Sakina!</i>

367
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.041
<i>You're so insensitive!</i>

368
00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:45.833
<i>It's the duty of a chaste woman</i>

369
00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:47.791
<i>to wait for her husband!</i>

370
00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:49.458
<i>To protect her honor</i>

371
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.083
<i>in his absence!</i>

372
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.458
<i>I am just worried about her.</i>

373
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.416
<i>She doesn't need you to worry!</i>

374
00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:55.791
You get out!

375
00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:56.791
Take your filthy mind

376
00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:57.958
and get out of my house.

377
00:29:58.208 --> 00:29:59.541
<i>Don't get so charged up!</i>

378
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:00.750
<i>Nobody wants to come</i>

379
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:02.041
<i>to this graveyard anyway!</i>

380
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.083
<i>Get out!</i>

381
00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:04.434
<i>Wait and watch what happens to you</i>

382
00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:06.083
<i>for this injustice!</i>

383
00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:20.583
Sister...

384
00:30:20.708 --> 00:30:21.708
Hmm?

385
00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:24.375
She is the only friend I have.

386
00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:26.666
So?

387
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:55.708
Have you ever seen

388
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:57.166
a lion hunt a deer?

389
00:31:01.208 --> 00:31:02.166
We believe

390
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:03.708
that their relationship is unfair

391
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.583
that of a predator and a prey

392
00:31:05.833 --> 00:31:08.416
of the cruel and the weak.

393
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:11.541
Wrong!

394
00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:15.791
Their relationship is pure. natural.

395
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:21.791
The predator needs to hunt.

396
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:25.083
And the prey fulfills that need.

397
00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:28.666
The lion never deceives the deer.

398
00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:32.125
In a single chase. it's clear

399
00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:35.458
that the lion is the predator

400
00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:38.500
and the deer is the prey.

401
00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:45.041
Human beings are predators too.

402
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:49.958
But we keep deceiving our prey.

403
00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:53.666
With lies and tricks

404
00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:56.291
and with mercy.

405
00:31:57.666 --> 00:32:01.166
Whereas our intention is the same.

406
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:06.458
To overcome our hunger. to hunt.

407
00:32:08.958 --> 00:32:12.708
We should never hide our intentions.

408
00:32:17.041 --> 00:32:19.041
We should be like a lion!

409
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:21.791
A beast!

410
00:32:54.666 --> 00:33:01.416
<i>Turn towards me. o beautiful!</i>

411
00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:07.333
<i>Turn towards me!</i>

412
00:33:08.583 --> 00:33:15.333
<i>Turn towards me. o beautiful!</i>

413
00:33:15.416 --> 00:33:21.958
<i>Turn towards me!</i>

414
00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:25.666
<i>You have me hooked</i>

415
00:33:25.708 --> 00:33:28.833
<i>and you tug at my heartstrings.</i>

416
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:32.458
<i>You have me hooked</i>

417
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.916
<i>and you tug at my heartstrings.</i>

418
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:39.291
<i>O beautiful!</i>

419
00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:45.583
<i>Turn towards me.</i>

420
00:33:46.583 --> 00:33:49.958
<i>Lovestruck!</i>

421
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.291
<i>We wander...</i>

422
00:33:53.375 --> 00:33:56.750
<i>Lovestruck!</i>

423
00:33:56.791 --> 00:34:00.083
<i>We wander...</i>

424
00:34:00.208 --> 00:34:04.458
<i>like wild beasts in the jungle.</i>

425
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.625
<i>O beautiful one!</i>

426
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:13.583
<i>Turn towards me.</i>

427
00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:54.708
<i>Bulleh Shah. I won't die!</i>

428
00:34:55.083 --> 00:35:01.583
<i>Bulleh Shah. I won't die!</i>

429
00:35:02.041 --> 00:35:08.458
<i>Bulleh Shah. I won't die!</i>

430
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:15.250
<i>Bulleh Shah. I won't die!</i>

431
00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:22.208
<i>Bulleh Shah. I won't die...</i>

432
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.583
<i>let it be someone else!</i>

433
00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:29.083
<i>O beautiful one!</i>

434
00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:35.000
<i>Turn towards me.</i>

435
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.166
<i>You have me hooked</i>

436
00:35:39.208 --> 00:35:42.625
<i>and you tug at my heartstrings.</i>

437
00:35:42.791 --> 00:35:46.166
<i>You have me hooked</i>

438
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:50.583
<i>and you tug at my heartstrings.</i>

439
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.000
<i>O beautiful...</i>

440
00:35:53.041 --> 00:36:01.041
<i>turn towards me.</i>

441
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.125
Hina.

442
00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:03.541
<i>I want to soar</i>

443
00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:06.625
<i>like a kite in the wind</i>

444
00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:09.083
<i>my love!</i>

445
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.833
<i>I want to soar</i>

446
00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:13.916
like a kite in the wind

447
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:16.083
my love!

448
00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:18.916
Take my heart

449
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:22.625
and make me yours. my love!

450
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:26.875
Clouds. so high!

451
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:31.083
Hello Mr Malik!

452
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:41.416
Had fun. you clowns?

453
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.250
He has seen everything now.

454
00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:45.791
As if he hadn't already.

455
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.791
He is very sleazy.

456
00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:48.916
Hello!

457
00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.208
Hello!

458
00:37:55.208 --> 00:37:57.458
You're coming late these days?

459
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.375
I talked to my mother.

460
00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:03.625
She will apologise to sister Sakina.

461
00:38:03.958 --> 00:38:05.708
I have told her

462
00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:08.333
if Hina doesn't come

463
00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:09.833
there won't be a wedding

464
00:38:09.916 --> 00:38:12.041
but a funeral.

465
00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:13.642
I'll either swallow a diamond or

466
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.833
hang myself from the fan.

467
00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:23.750
Ma’am Zeenat isn't here?

468
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.791
Nope.

469
00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:27.250
Its been a while.

470
00:38:28.708 --> 00:38:29.875
I'll go check.

471
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.708
And don't say such things.

472
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:46.250
<i>Zeen... get up!</i>

473
00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:47.416
<i>Get up!</i>

474
00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:48.458
<i>Are you okay?</i>

475
00:38:49.958 --> 00:38:51.833
<i>How much did you drink?</i>

476
00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:54.083
<i>How much?</i>

477
00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:59.083
Come on. come on. Get up.

478
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.750
Like what?

479
00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:07.958
What do I have to do?

480
00:39:08.375 --> 00:39:09.875
What will you do with me?

481
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:11.291
Zeen!

482
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:12.375
What?

483
00:39:13.333 --> 00:39:14.875
You have to get back to rehab.

484
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.333
Fuck off!

485
00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:19.500
Zeen...

486
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.791
Zeen...

487
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.000
Its going to get tough.

488
00:39:26.458 --> 00:39:28.083
Too tough.

489
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.500
I'll call your sister.

490
00:39:32.166 --> 00:39:33.375
Just get out of here.

491
00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:34.916
Zeen...

492
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.541
Get out of here!

493
00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.333
Why are you standing?

494
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:09.708
Come.

495
00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:13.708
Sit over there.

496
00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:32.541
Are you alright Ma’am?

497
00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:35.375
I'm fine.

498
00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:51.958
Your skin is so transparent.

499
00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:58.625
Enjoy it while you can.

500
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:01.666
Doesn't last.

501
00:41:04.166 --> 00:41:07.708
All colors fade.

502
00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.666
Nothing lasts.

503
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.541
Look at me.

504
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:22.833
Can you see?

505
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:31.250
I used to like

506
00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:32.833
the pain in your eyes.

507
00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:39.166
Like some old memory.

508
00:41:44.583 --> 00:41:46.750
But now

509
00:41:48.583 --> 00:41:50.375
I'm bored

510
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.416
of this cheap emotional appeal.

511
00:41:54.916 --> 00:41:56.208
Escape.

512
00:41:58.416 --> 00:42:01.958
Escape from wherever you're stuck.

513
00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:04.541
Escape right away.

514
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:07.208
Soon as you get an opportunity

515
00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:09.791
seize it.

516
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:13.041
Grab it.

517
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:17.791
Or else...

518
00:42:19.333 --> 00:42:23.708
One gets addicted to the pain.

519
00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:33.000
Just like you get addicted

520
00:42:33.041 --> 00:42:35.708
to gin and tonic.

521
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:40.583
And then. just to gin.

522
00:43:19.958 --> 00:43:21.875
<i>I'm sure...</i>

523
00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:24.416
my sister-in-law looks beautiful.

524
00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:26.750
May God protect you

525
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:29.750
from evil eyes and evil plans.

526
00:43:31.166 --> 00:43:33.208
You should come too

527
00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:34.958
Aunty Naseem even apologised

528
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
to you.

529
00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:37.291
Let it be.

530
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:39.250
I'm allowing you to go

531
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:41.000
and that's enough.

532
00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:43.333
We rarely get a chance

533
00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:44.916
to get out of this house.

534
00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:48.083
Don't you feel suffocated

535
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.041
being home all the time?

536
00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:52.583
Houses don't suffocate you

537
00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:54.541
they protect you.

538
00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:07.500
I'm leaving sister.

539
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:08.625
Yes yes...

540
00:44:25.916 --> 00:44:27.416
Go now.

541
00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:29.708
But come back soon.

542
00:44:30.791 --> 00:44:33.708
Okay but don't get worried.

543
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.541
You have put on henna?

544
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:40.833
Yes.

545
00:44:42.416 --> 00:44:43.791
Henna on Hina!

546
00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:49.166
It sounds so nice to hear

547
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:50.958
you call me by my name.

548
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:53.000
Please call me Hina.

549
00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:54.416
No. no!

550
00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.541
You're my sister-in-law.

551
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:13.458
You look pretty!

552
00:45:13.583 --> 00:45:14.708
Turn.

553
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:15.541
Lets put the braid on the front...

554
00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:17.291
it'll look nice.

555
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:23.958
Do me a favour.

556
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Hmm?

557
00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:27.166
Lock this door and guard it.

558
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:28.291
And if somebody comes

559
00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:29.666
tell them I'm changing.

560
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.333
Why?

561
00:45:30.375 --> 00:45:31.375
Go on!

562
00:45:31.958 --> 00:45:33.958
Do it. please!

563
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:42.791
So impatient!

564
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:44.541
You invite me yourself

565
00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:46.666
and then call me impatient?

566
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.291
Turn around.

567
00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:10.375
<i>Let’s burn the house down girls!</i>

568
00:46:10.916 --> 00:46:14.208
<i>Let’s shine like a diamonds girls!</i>

569
00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:16.416
<i>Dare someone</i>

<i>let’s pin him to the ground girls!</i>

572
00:46:25.041 --> 00:46:29.458
<i>Let’s burn the house down girls!</i>

573
00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:32.125
<i>Do I look ok?</i>

574
00:46:45.125 --> 00:46:50.375
<i>Let’s go get what we want girls!</i>

575
00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:55.208
<i>Let’s rock the world girls!</i>

576
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.916
<i>Dare someone</i>

<i>let’s make him pay for it girls!</i>

579
00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:09.708
<i>Let’s burn the house down girls!</i>

580
00:47:11.583 --> 00:47:12.791
<i>Oh my heart kept thumping...</i>

581
00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:14.000
<i>It kept racing...</i>

582
00:47:14.125 --> 00:47:15.333
<i>How my heart kept burning...</i>

583
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.166
<i>It kept losing...</i>

584
00:47:20.958 --> 00:47:22.208
<i>I kept quiet!</i>

585
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:23.458
<i>I kept my cool!</i>

586
00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:24.875
<i>I suffered in silence!</i>

587
00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:27.416
<i>I waited!</i>

588
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:31.500
<i>You didn’t come.</i>

589
00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:34.291
<i>You didn’t even fight.</i>

590
00:47:34.416 --> 00:47:36.833
<i>You didn’t reply.</i>

591
00:47:37.041 --> 00:47:40.000
<i>You didn’t even give me a sign.</i>

592
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:13.541
<i>My beloved is far away...</i>

593
00:48:13.875 --> 00:48:17.708
<i>It’s hard to even breathe.</i>

594
00:48:21.958 --> 00:48:25.750
<i>My beloved is far away...</i>

595
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:29.875
<i>It’s hard to even breathe.</i>

596
00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:33.708
<i>This longing feels so heavy...</i>

597
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:37.916
<i>This grief has consumed me.</i>

598
00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:43.541
<i>There is no one like my Mirza!</i>

599
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.916
<i>O mother. bid me farewell.</i>

600
00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:53.541
<i>Let’s carve our own path girls!</i>

601
00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:58.083
<i>Let’s conquer grief girls!</i>

602
00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:04.125
<i>We are warriors!</i>

603
00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:08.166
<i>Let’s not accept defeat girls!</i>

604
00:49:08.541 --> 00:49:13.083
<i>Let’s burn the house down girls!</i>

605
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:28.500
I don't know why I’ve come here.

606
00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:41.708
Do you want to go back?

607
00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:43.708
No.

608
00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:49.041
I don't know.

609
00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.791
I'm married.

610
00:50:57.083 --> 00:50:59.333
Does he not love you?

611
00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:04.041
Does he hit you?

612
00:51:09.625 --> 00:51:11.791
Or is he unfaithful?

613
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.208
He just went away... somewhere.

614
00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:22.666
That means he was a fool.

615
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:09.958
<i>Stay.</i>

616
00:52:11.041 --> 00:52:15.208
<i>Stay and let me look at you.</i>

617
00:52:17.041 --> 00:52:21.125
<i>Never go away.</i>

618
00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:26.875
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

619
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.875
<i>Stay.</i>

620
00:52:31.791 --> 00:52:36.125
<i>Stay and let me look at you.</i>

621
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:42.041
<i>Never go away.</i>

622
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.791
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

623
00:52:52.416 --> 00:52:54.916
<i>Lets pour our hearts out.</i>

624
00:52:55.375 --> 00:52:57.375
<i>Let’s sit right here.</i>

625
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:01.250
<i>These moments of togetherness</i>

626
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:03.458
<i>may never be had again.</i>

627
00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:06.708
<i>Lets pour our hearts out.</i>

628
00:53:06.833 --> 00:53:09.416
<i>Let’s sit right here.</i>

629
00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:12.916
<i>These moments of togetherness</i>

630
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:15.250
<i>may never be had again.</i>

631
00:53:15.708 --> 00:53:17.458
<i>I can’t...</i>

632
00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:24.541
<i>I can’t look at you enough.</i>

633
00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:30.208
<i>You have my heart.</i>

634
00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:35.833
<i>Never go away.</i>

635
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.958
<i>Stay.</i>

636
00:53:39.791 --> 00:53:44.083
<i>Stay and let me look at you.</i>

637
00:53:45.916 --> 00:53:50.000
<i>Never go away.</i>

638
00:53:51.791 --> 00:53:56.208
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

639
00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:07.625
<i>Let’s do away with this</i>

640
00:54:07.708 --> 00:54:09.291
<i>distance between us.</i>

641
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.291
<i>Let’s stay together.</i>

642
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:15.416
<i>My heart aches...</i>

643
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:17.791
<i>I want a life with you.</i>

644
00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:19.291
<i>Let’s do away with this</i>

645
00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:20.791
<i>distance between us.</i>

646
00:54:20.958 --> 00:54:23.666
<i>Let’s stay together.</i>

647
00:54:24.291 --> 00:54:27.041
<i>My heart aches...</i>

648
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.625
<i>I want a life with you.</i>

649
00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:33.166
<i>Every breath!</i>

650
00:54:33.333 --> 00:54:38.416
<i>Every breath I have left in me...</i>

651
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:44.375
<i>I’d gladly let you take it away.</i>

652
00:54:44.875 --> 00:54:49.541
<i>Never go away.</i>

653
00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:52.958
<i>Stay.</i>

654
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:58.625
<i>Stay and let me look at you.</i>

655
00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:03.750
<i>Never go away.</i>

656
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:09.416
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

657
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:15.458
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

658
00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:22.041
<i>Stay. the apple of my eye.</i>

659
00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:39.958
Sister?

660
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:41.125
Sister-in-law?

661
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:45.791
Where have you been? Where?

662
00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:48.416
Why do you worry so much?

663
00:55:48.458 --> 00:55:50.375
Nothing will happen to me.

664
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:52.541
Come inside.

665
00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.083
Lets go inside.

666
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:57.208
Why do you worry so much!

667
00:57:01.333 --> 00:57:03.208
Did you miss your period?

668
00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:08.083
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

669
00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:12.916
Yes.

670
00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:16.375
Do you feel well?

671
00:57:17.041 --> 00:57:18.583
Yes.

672
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:21.375
Beginning Asr prayer now...

673
00:57:21.416 --> 00:57:22.791
facing the Qibla...

674
00:57:22.833 --> 00:57:25.416
God is great...

675
00:57:37.041 --> 00:57:38.666
<i>Send an SMS to 776</i>

<i>and the melody of this rain.</i>

694

Shall we elope?

695
01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:51.333
Have the kids left?

696
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.791
Why didn't you go?

697
01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:05.541
<i>Sister-in-law?</i>

698
01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.583
<i>You're here!</i>

699
01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.291
<i>You got late again today?</i>

700
01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:15.208
<i>Do you know Saqlain is back!</i>

701
01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:18.958
<i>You too freshen up quickly.</i>

702
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:21.291
<i>I've cooked his favourite pilav!</i>

703
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.541
<i>Lets make mint chutney with it!</i>

704
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.166
<i>He went off to meet Usman</i>

705
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.708
<i>after waiting for you.</i>

706
01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:28.583
<i>He should be back soon!</i>

707
01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:31.083
<i>Go freshen up!</i>

708
01:03:00.708 --> 01:03:02.041
Saqlain?

709
01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:06.166
Saqlain?

710
01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:10.541
Hina?

711
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.916
Where's brother Usman?

712
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:19.041
Where is Saqlain?

713
01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:23.416
Saqlain?

714
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:25.791
Sister Sakina said he is back

715
01:03:25.916 --> 01:03:28.416
and he came to meet you.

716
01:04:22.041 --> 01:04:24.583
I'm tired.

717
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.041
I’m tired of hoping

718
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.541
that one day he will return.

719
01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:37.500
Today. I decided to demand

720
01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:41.458
from God to send him back.

721
01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:49.916
God didn't listen to me.

722
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.416
I swear. for a second

723
01:04:55.666 --> 01:05:00.041
I felt like he was really here.

724
01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:03.291
I could smell his scent

725
01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.250
around the whole house.

726
01:05:11.416 --> 01:05:15.458
You can’t demand from your Lord.

727
01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:20.916
Please forgive me. my Lord.

728
01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:24.541
Please forgive me. my Lord.

729
01:05:31.416 --> 01:05:33.916
Please forgive me. my Lord.

730
01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.208
Your kitten died.

731
01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.208
Sister-in-law?

732
01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.541
Do you remember

733
01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:34.208
the floods of 2009?

734
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:36.583
The rains didn't stop

735
01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:38.541
for a month and a half.

736
01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:40.541
And then one morning Saqlain...

737
01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.000
Stop sister!

738
01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:44.500
I don't want to hear

739
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:47.291
any story right now.

740
01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:50.041
The rains will come and go.

741
01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:52.059
The same seasons will come back

742
01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.541
again and again.

743
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.875
But none of it matters.

744
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:02.041
Floods and rains will change nothing.

745
01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:03.833
Life in this house

746
01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.666
will remain the way it is.

747
01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:34.833
Want to see a magic trick?

748
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:49.375
Keep looking at the water.

749
01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:54.708
Three. two. one!

750
01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:08.416
It is only natural that a man

751
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.291
is attracted to a woman.

752
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:12.458
And likewise a woman

753
01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:14.916
is attarcted to a man.

754
01:09:14.958 --> 01:09:17.375
That is why our religion

755
01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:18.809
has given us directions and guidance

756
01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:20.101
regarding the formation of a lawful

757
01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.333
and acceptable relationship

758
01:09:21.375 --> 01:09:22.791
between the two genders.

759
01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:24.458
It has shown us the light.

760
01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:26.541
It has given us knowledge.

761
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:27.500
So that we humans

762
01:09:27.583 --> 01:09:29.750
do not behave like animals.

763
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.916
It has clearly told mankind

764
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.000
the righteous. permissible way

765
01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:35.875
to satisfy our emotional and physical

766
01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:38.208
needs through lawful marriage.

767
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.208
According to religious scholars

768
01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:43.000
an adult who has the resources

769
01:09:43.083 --> 01:09:45.625
to marry and he fears

770
01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:48.041
that he might go astray...

771
01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:50.583
It is incumbent upon him to marry.

772
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:52.791
Because if he doesn't go the lawful

773
01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:55.291
route the chances of him committing

774
01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:57.416
a sin are increased.

775
01:09:57.541 --> 01:10:00.083
Hence ladies. save your children

776
01:10:00.166 --> 01:10:02.791
from such sins and make sure

777
01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:04.875
they are lawfully wedded when

778
01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:07.291
they reach the appropriate age.

779
01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:09.083
Thank you very much Ma'am

780
01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:10.958
for telling us such important things

781
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.791
in such a beautiful way.

782
01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:14.500
I'm sure your words must have

783
01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:16.166
been beneficial for all of us.

784
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.250
Yes. yes

785
01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:20.125
If anyone has a confusion or

786
01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:22.250
problem or if there's a question

787
01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:23.958
then please don’t hesitate

788
01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:25.291
to share with madam.

789
01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:26.708
We don't know when

790
01:10:26.791 --> 01:10:28.916
we will see her again.

791
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.250
You?

792
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.250
Anyone else?

793
01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:42.416
Nobody has any question to ask?

794
01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:45.291
Okay then I’ll ask a question.

795
01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:50.458
So Ma’am. I wanted to ask...

796
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:55.791
if a woman's husband disappears...

797
01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:58.291
goes missing...

798
01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.541
and for many years he doesn’t

799
01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:03.041
make any contact with her...

800
01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:04.666
Would that woman still be

801
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:06.166
considered married to him?

802
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:07.875
What is the status of such

803
01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:09.541
a marriage according to Islam?

804
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:11.416
A husband who goes missing

805
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.208
for a long time

806
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:16.416
is called 'Mafqood-ul-khabar'.

807
01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:18.375
Such a woman should

808
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:19.875
wait for four years...

809
01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:23.083
then she shall seek legal help

810
01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:25.041
from a court for a decision...

811
01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:26.500
then she shall observe the

812
01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.375
'term of widowhood' for three months.

813
01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:31.000
After that as per the court

814
01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:34.125
and Islamic law. she has the right

815
01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:39.416
to re-marry according to her will.

816
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:43.416
Marriage is a sacred institution.

817
01:11:43.583 --> 01:11:46.458
May Allah help those

818
01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:50.083
who respect the sanctity of this act.

819
01:11:50.208 --> 01:11:52.708
Amen!

820
01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.375
You made me go there

821
01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:09.166
to listen to all of this!

822
01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:11.916
I only knew that there was a lecture.

823
01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:12.875
I didn’t know what

824
01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:15.083
they would talk about.

825
01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:18.708
Such wicked and insensitive people!

826
01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.458
There's no need to go to

827
01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:23.250
their house for work anymore!

828
01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:48.750
What happened?

829
01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:52.875
A burden has been lifted off

830
01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:54.166
my heart and all my fears

831
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:56.000
have left me.

832
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:15.458
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

833
01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:18.500
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

834
01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:20.625
<i>How my heart soars</i>

835
01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:24.500
<i>flutters and flies!</i>

836
01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:30.041
<i>What my heart yearns for!</i>

837
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:33.416
<i>I wish I could explain...</i>

838
01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:36.583
<i>how my heart flutters...</i>

839
01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:42.125
<i>what my heart yearns for!</i>

840
01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:45.500
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

841
01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:48.875
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

842
01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:55.000
<i>When I peek within...</i>

843
01:13:55.166 --> 01:14:00.666
<i>all I see is darkness.</i>

844
01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:07.000
<i>My life is but worthless.</i>

845
01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:09.208
<i>Please shed some</i>

846
01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:12.416
<i>of your light on me.</i>

847
01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:14.750
<i>Time stands still it seems</i>

848
01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:18.458
<i>yet my heart beats!</i>

849
01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:24.916
<i>As if it's caught in a whirlwind!</i>

850
01:14:30.541 --> 01:14:32.791
<i>Time stands still it seems</i>

851
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:36.416
<i>yet my heart beats!</i>

852
01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:42.375
<i>As if it's caught in a whirlwind!</i>

853
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.083
<i>I cry. I laugh...</i>

854
01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:48.416
<i>I have lost my mind!</i>

855
01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:51.083
<i>I want to drift away but</i>

856
01:14:51.166 --> 01:14:54.250
<i>not too far I'm afraid!</i>

857
01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:56.583
What do you think?

858
01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.125
It’s very nice.

859
01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:00.875
And what about Hina?

860
01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:06.125
Poor beautiful lonely girl...

861
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:12.208
She needs someone!

862
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.416
<i>I wish I could explain...</i>

863
01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:18.458
<i>How my heart flies...</i>

864
01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:24.291
<i>maddens and vexes me!</i>

865
01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.375
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

866
01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:30.458
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

867
01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:54.125
<i>I wonder where this</i>

868
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.416
<i>gust of wind will take me!</i>

869
01:15:57.625 --> 01:16:00.166
<i>I may land on the clouds</i>

870
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:05.000
<i>never to return!</i>

871
01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:12.125
<i>I wonder where this</i>

872
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:15.416
<i>gust of wind will take me!</i>

873
01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:18.166
<i>I may land on the clouds</i>

874
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:21.166
<i>never to return!</i>

875
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:27.250
<i>What has this nomadic heart to lose?</i>

876
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.041
<i>The world around me</i>

877
01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:33.375
<i>is losing its charm!</i>

878
01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:36.416
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

879
01:16:36.708 --> 01:16:39.416
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

880
01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:41.083
<i>What my heart is up to</i>

881
01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:45.416
<i>It's scared of nothing!</i>

882
01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:51.333
<i>It sighs. it refuses to listen!</i>

883
01:16:51.625 --> 01:16:54.500
<i>I wish I could explain...</i>

884
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:57.541
<i>what this heart is up to...</i>

885
01:16:57.625 --> 01:17:03.375
<i>sighing. refusing to listen!</i>

886
01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:06.458
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

887
01:17:06.666 --> 01:17:09.541
<i>I wish I could explain!</i>

888
01:17:29.791 --> 01:17:31.375
Marry me!

889
01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:20.708
Hina! Is that you?

890
01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:22.375
Yes...

891
01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:23.875
Is everything okay?

892
01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:25.166
What?

893
01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.916
Where are you going?

894
01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.708
I'm just going home.

895
01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:33.291
Get in the car. I will drop you.

896
01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.083
Get in.

897
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.625
Where were you for so long?

898
01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:00.416
I was at Noori's.

899
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.708
I told you about it.

900
01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.000
We were just sitting

901
01:20:03.041 --> 01:20:03.791
when it started raining.

902
01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.791
She said to wait till it stops.

903
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.666
Does such irresponsible behaviour

904
01:20:07.791 --> 01:20:09.666
suit a young lone woman?

905
01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:11.333
Okay sister. let's go inside.

906
01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:14.125
Why are you standing in the rain!

907
01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:58.666
Kids reciting Arabic verses.

908
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:01.666
I'll get it.

909
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:10.375
Reciting the Quran.

910
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Very good!

911
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:13.458
<i>Hello Zeenat Ma’am.</i>

912
01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:16.000
Can I come in?

913
01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:18.875
Oh sorry. please do.

914
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.833
Wow!

915
01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:26.291
Ma’am Zeenat is here.

916
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.625
Please have a seat.

917
01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:43.125
We never get to meet.

918
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:44.791
I do meet Hina everyday

919
01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.125
and I always ask about you.

920
01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:49.791
Really?

921
01:21:50.541 --> 01:21:52.541
May Allah reward you for it!

922
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.041
I'll just...

923
01:21:59.125 --> 01:22:02.375
I wanted to talk to you...

924
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:05.791
Talk to me?

925
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:09.666
Yes...

926
01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.375
Instead of beating about the bush

927
01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:14.750
it’s better to be straightforward.

928
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.583
I'm here to ask

929
01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:20.333
for Hina's hand in marriage...

930
01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:22.458
with my husband. Malik Nadir.

931
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:24.250
What?

932
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:26.875
Look!

933
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:33.875
Try to listen to me with patience.

934
01:22:35.291 --> 01:22:38.833
You know my husband. Mr Malik...

935
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.541
you know about me too...

936
01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:47.875
A home is incomplete without kids...

937
01:22:48.083 --> 01:22:49.500
And God has not...

938
01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.041
Students!

939
01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.750
Close your books and go home.

940
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:56.000
Come tomorrow.

941
01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:57.500
Goodbye.

942
01:22:57.625 --> 01:22:59.666
Goodbye sister!

943
01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:33.791
It's a sin to marry a woman

944
01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:35.166
who is already married!

945
01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:36.208
Grave sin!

946
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.666
It is forbidden

947
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.000
and I will not let any such

948
01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:40.625
immorality take place!

949
01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:42.250
Remember

950
01:23:42.291 --> 01:23:45.041
what that lady scholar said?

951
01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:47.416
I heard what the lady scholar said.

952
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.916
I heard everything!

953
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:50.166
There are many other

954
01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:51.500
commandments of God too.

955
01:23:51.541 --> 01:23:52.791
But everyone is just worried

956
01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:55.250
about Hina's marriage!

957
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.375
We don't beg anyone for anything.

958
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:00.875
Nobody has any favours upon us!

959
01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:03.541
Do me a favour and leave!

960
01:24:03.666 --> 01:24:07.000
But do ask Hina about this too.

961
01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.000
I'll ask Hina whatever I want.

962
01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:12.125
You please leave us alone!

963
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.500
Hina!

964
01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.375
Tell her that my God has given

965
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.375
me a lot of patience but

966
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.000
if I misbehave then she herself

967
01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:22.166
would be responsible for it!

968
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.375
Goodbye.

969
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.041
Be afraid!

970
01:24:36.208 --> 01:24:38.416
Fear the wrath of God!

971
01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:08.708
Sister...

972
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:12.500
I have nothing to do with this.

973
01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:16.291
Hmm...

974
01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:24.125
It's not your fault.

975
01:25:27.166 --> 01:25:33.541
It is the fault of this body...

976
01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:40.375
and its impure needs...

977
01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:46.000
that make a human falter and sin.

978
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.666
We forget that this body

979
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:53.000
is made of dust...

980
01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:55.666
and it will eventually

981
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:59.166
be eaten by vermin.

982
01:26:02.166 --> 01:26:04.541
I could smell it...

983
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:09.583
Since days I could smell

984
01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:12.250
sin on your body!

985
01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.916
I could smell it!

986
01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:18.375
You betrayed me!

987
01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:20.083
I can't see no more

988
01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:21.833
that's why I still have your

989
01:26:21.916 --> 01:26:23.666
innocent face imprinted in my mind!

990
01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:25.041
But it must have disfigured.

991
01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:26.583
Your deeds must have

992
01:26:26.666 --> 01:26:28.291
disfigured your face!

993
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.458
Why couldn't you wait for Saqlain?

994
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:34.250
Why couldn't you?

995
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.125
Why couldn't you defend his honour

996
01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:37.916
that he left with you and me

997
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.541
to take care of!

998
01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:42.416
You are his lawfully wedded wife.

999
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.041
Why were you unable to

1000
01:26:44.125 --> 01:26:45.458
protect your honour!

1001
01:26:45.541 --> 01:26:48.750
Why did you disgrace all of us!

1002
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:54.250
I called you sister-in-law because

1003
01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.750
you were the honour of this house!

1004
01:26:56.916 --> 01:26:58.958
But you turned out to be henna!

1005
01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:01.000
Staining others with your tint...

1006
01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:02.708
your filthy tint!

1007
01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:04.666
Is this why you dress up

1008
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.833
everyday to go to their house!

1009
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.250
Tell me why you did this!

1010
01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.875
Why did you do this to me!

1011
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.375
Tell me!

1012
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.875
Tell me!

1013
01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:15.791
Tell me or else I will kill you!

1014
01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:18.000
Tell me why you did this!

1015
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:25.916
May you rot!

1016
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.541
May your body rot in hell...

1017
01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:32.500
that has laden you with sins!

1018
01:27:33.375 --> 01:27:34.750
It is His wrath!

1019
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:37.333
It is the wrath of God!

1020
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.625
The wrath of God!

1021
01:28:08.166 --> 01:28:10.416
What have I done...

1022
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.041
Oh God!

1023
01:28:12.416 --> 01:28:13.750
Sister-in-law?

1024
01:28:13.958 --> 01:28:15.458
Please forgive me sister-in-law.

1025
01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:17.875
I have been so cruel.

1026
01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:19.958
Why did my hands not break

1027
01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:22.791
before hitting an orphan!

1028
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:25.875
Listen...

1029
01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:28.708
I'm like a mother to you. right?

1030
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.166
Mothers can be a little stern.

1031
01:28:33.666 --> 01:28:36.041
Sister-in-law?

1032
01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:39.125
Please forgive me sister-in-law.

1033
01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:42.791
Forgive me for the sake of God.

1034
01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:45.625
Forgive me.

1035
01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:49.875
Sister-in-law.

1036
01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:22.375
It's...

1037
01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.875
It's very nice.

1038
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:30.375
Speak the truth... for once.

1039
01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:33.041
I can take it. you know.

1040
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:36.958
I prefer it when

1041
01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:38.500
you're mean and honest.

1042
01:29:38.625 --> 01:29:41.291
When you try to be sweet...

1043
01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:43.708
I can't stand it!

1044
01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.791
I wasn't great

1045
01:29:47.958 --> 01:29:50.375
but I wasn't bad.

1046
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.833
But these are awful!

1047
01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:02.500
Where's all the fire gone?

1048
01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:10.791
Did you put it out. Mr Malik?

1049
01:30:14.125 --> 01:30:16.500
And where's your fire gone?

1050
01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:31.000
Earlier...

1051
01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.166
I would be at the other end

1052
01:30:34.708 --> 01:30:36.041
of the room but I could

1053
01:30:36.208 --> 01:30:38.541
still feel your heat.

1054
01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:44.041
But now...

1055
01:30:44.208 --> 01:30:46.791
nothing happens!

1056
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:52.291
I don't even get angry.

1057
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:57.041
I just get irritated.

1058
01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:09.416
Did the truth hurt. Mr Malik?

1059
01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:11.833
Hmph!

1060
01:31:13.416 --> 01:31:16.750
Have I offended you?

1061
01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:20.125
Not at all.

1062
01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:26.500
I realised a long time ago...

1063
01:31:28.541 --> 01:31:32.625
that my joyous talented wife

1064
01:31:33.791 --> 01:31:36.000
is now no more

1065
01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:38.666
than a bitter

1066
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:40.791
toxic

1067
01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:43.291
angry creature.

1068
01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:42.625
Where did you go sister-in-law?

1069
01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:53.625
Tell me?

1070
01:33:54.375 --> 01:33:56.125
Where did you go?

1071
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.750
Nowhere.

1072
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:04.041
You don't want to tell

1073
01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:06.625
or is it that you can't tell?

1074
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:12.791
You went to Mr Malik. right?

1075
01:34:16.291 --> 01:34:17.458
Now shall I tell you clearly

1076
01:34:17.541 --> 01:34:19.125
what sin you are committing?

1077
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:21.083
When a lawfully married woman...

1078
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:23.291
Enough!

1079
01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.791
Quiet!

1080
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:30.166
What marriage?

1081
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.625
Whose marriage?

1082
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:37.375
This isn’t a marraige. this is hell!

1083
01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:39.083
It's a deep dark pit

1084
01:34:39.166 --> 01:34:42.791
and I’m rotting away in it.

1085
01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:46.583
You call this painful wait

1086
01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:48.583
of eight years a marriage!

1087
01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:51.125
I don't want to wait anymore!

1088
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:52.791
I don't want to die

1089
01:34:52.875 --> 01:34:55.750
in this dark pit with you!

1090
01:34:57.791 --> 01:35:00.166
If God has taken away your sight

1091
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:01.625
why do you pull me

1092
01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:03.541
into the dark with you?

1093
01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:05.875
And don't you dare...

1094
01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:09.500
raise your hand against me!

1095
01:35:15.125 --> 01:35:16.916
And Saqlain...?

1096
01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:21.250
Saqlain is only a memory.

1097
01:35:26.291 --> 01:35:28.125
This!

1098
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:30.250
This trunk!

1099
01:35:30.541 --> 01:35:32.250
This is Saqlain...

1100
01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:35.166
that reeks of phenyl balls!

1101
01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:38.166
His memories are rotting inside

1102
01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:40.166
just like I am!

1103
01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:45.666
I can't stand this stench anymore!

1104
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:50.750
Saqlain! Saqlain! Saqlain!

1105
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:44.083
Ma’am Zeenat wants me

1106
01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:46.416
to marry her husband.

1107
01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:49.791
But who did this?

1108
01:36:52.166 --> 01:36:53.541
Sister Sakina...

1109
01:36:54.916 --> 01:36:57.500
Sister Sakina says... Allah's wrath...

1110
01:36:57.916 --> 01:37:00.625
Allah’s wrath will be on me.

1111
01:37:01.166 --> 01:37:03.125
Amaltas. please save me.

1112
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.375
Save me from everyone's wrath.

1113
01:37:05.625 --> 01:37:06.791
Amaltas...

1114
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:08.500
Mr Malik is a powerful man.

1115
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.375
Amaltas take me away!

1116
01:37:11.875 --> 01:37:13.041
Shall we run away?

1117
01:37:13.125 --> 01:37:13.958
Shall we?

1118
01:37:14.041 --> 01:37:15.375
But where would we go?

1119
01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:16.541
I will have to face

1120
01:37:16.625 --> 01:37:17.851
your family's wrath too. right?

1121
01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:18.875
I’ll have to suffer

1122
01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:20.208
your family’s wrath too!

1123
01:37:20.291 --> 01:37:23.250
I’ll have to suffer their wrath too!

1124
01:37:23.625 --> 01:37:25.916
No!

1125
01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:30.041
No... Not at all.

1126
01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:33.041
My home...

1127
01:37:33.291 --> 01:37:35.458
my world...

1128
01:37:35.666 --> 01:37:37.500
my mother...

1129
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:42.625
They will all welcome you.

1130
01:37:44.166 --> 01:37:46.125
Come on...

1131
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:49.666
Let's go.

1132
01:38:02.666 --> 01:38:04.500
I will be back...

1133
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:09.250
I will be back in a while.

1134
01:38:09.625 --> 01:38:10.958
There are some matters...

1135
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.625
they are too entangled...

1136
01:38:13.083 --> 01:38:15.416
I have to untangle them.

1137
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:18.541
I have to say my last goodbye.

1138
01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:24.791
You trust me. right?

1139
01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:30.791
Now I have more faith in myself.

1140
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:47.541
<i>Without you beloved...</i>

1141
01:38:47.708 --> 01:38:51.375
<i>I will be ruined.</i>

1142
01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:55.000
<i>Without you beloved...</i>

1143
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.500
<i>Without you beloved...</i>

1144
01:39:02.666 --> 01:39:06.333
<i>I will be ruined.</i>

1145
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:10.083
<i>Go if you must</i>

1146
01:39:10.458 --> 01:39:13.916
<i>but forget me you must not.</i>

1147
01:39:14.125 --> 01:39:17.458
<i>Go if you must</i>

1148
01:39:17.833 --> 01:39:21.291
<i>but forget me you must not.</i>

1149
01:39:22.208 --> 01:39:27.208
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1150
01:39:27.458 --> 01:39:29.250
Hello.

1151
01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:31.958
Hello.

1152
01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.625
Hello Sakina.

1153
01:39:37.875 --> 01:39:38.791
You could have called me

1154
01:39:38.833 --> 01:39:40.250
I would have come.

1155
01:39:42.791 --> 01:39:45.791
I'm happy to see you.

1156
01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:49.375
Would you like something to drink?

1157
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.041
Please forgive me sister.

1158
01:40:07.375 --> 01:40:10.416
I didn't mean to say all that.

1159
01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:14.250
It's ok my child.

1160
01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:17.750
Mortals are meant to falter.

1161
01:40:20.875 --> 01:40:24.041
All of us make mistakes.

1162
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.625
He went away for our sake...

1163
01:41:19.666 --> 01:41:21.875
to ensure our happiness.

1164
01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:48.666
His friend Awais sent this

1165
01:41:50.041 --> 01:41:53.125
soon after he had left.

1166
01:42:01.166 --> 01:42:03.625
Four of them had left together...

1167
01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:06.250
discreetly on a ship.

1168
01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:12.666
But only three of them reached alive.

1169
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:17.416
Verily we belong to Allah

1170
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.750
and verily to Him do we return.

1171
01:42:56.875 --> 01:43:00.291
He was always a lucky one.

1172
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.500
When our ceiling collapsed

1173
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:06.041
during the earthquake...

1174
01:43:06.125 --> 01:43:07.583
both papa and mother died!

1175
01:43:07.625 --> 01:43:09.416
My head was hit and I lost my sight!

1176
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.375
Saqlain was there too!

1177
01:43:14.375 --> 01:43:16.208
Nothing at all happened to him.

1178
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:23.375
It’s hard to believe it unless

1179
01:43:23.416 --> 01:43:25.333
you see it with your own eyes.

1180
01:43:27.916 --> 01:43:30.958
So I couldn’t believe it for years.

1181
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.666
No!

1182
01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:17.625
Sshhh...

1183
01:44:29.291 --> 01:44:30.625
Today marks your first day

1184
01:44:30.666 --> 01:44:32.208
as a widow.

1185
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.291
As per tradition you can't step out

1186
01:44:37.333 --> 01:44:39.750
for four months and ten days.

1187
01:44:55.625 --> 01:44:58.000
As soon as this term is over

1188
01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:00.333
I’ll have you married to Mr Malik.

1189
01:45:02.625 --> 01:45:05.666
Right according to your wish.

1190
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:26.875
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1191
01:45:27.375 --> 01:45:33.750
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1192
01:45:34.375 --> 01:45:40.958
<i>Don’t walk away from me darling.</i>

1193
01:45:42.375 --> 01:45:45.958
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1194
01:45:50.333 --> 01:45:56.250
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1195
01:46:11.791 --> 01:46:15.625
<i>It is but your name</i>

1196
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:18.958
<i>written in my heart.</i>

1197
01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:22.958
<i>Written in my heart...</i>

1198
01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:30.416
<i>It is but your name</i>

1199
01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:33.708
<i>written in my heart.</i>

1200
01:46:34.416 --> 01:46:37.833
<i>Separated from you...</i>

1201
01:46:38.041 --> 01:46:41.791
<i>I am bound to die.</i>

1202
01:46:43.541 --> 01:46:47.375
<i>Separated from you...</i>

1203
01:46:47.625 --> 01:46:50.916
<i>I am bound to die.</i>

1204
01:46:51.583 --> 01:46:59.166
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1205
01:47:00.041 --> 01:47:07.708
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1206
01:47:09.291 --> 01:47:15.333
<i>Dont walk away from me darling.</i>

1207
01:47:15.791 --> 01:47:19.708
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1208
01:47:24.291 --> 01:47:29.041
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1209
01:47:57.958 --> 01:48:00.375
Hello

1210
01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:03.833
dear...

1211
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.875
husband!

1212
01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:56.708
I roasted this rabbit myself.

1213
01:49:02.375 --> 01:49:05.458
What exactly are we celebrating?

1214
01:49:13.958 --> 01:49:15.916
Your second marriage

1215
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.250
has been fixed!

1216
01:49:36.833 --> 01:49:39.041
Won't you say anything?

1217
01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:54.500
Eat!

1218
01:50:32.708 --> 01:50:34.875
Why aren't you eating?

1219
01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:42.875
Eat up. Mr Malik!

1220
01:50:43.333 --> 01:50:45.125
Fuel up!

1221
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.375
Eat your fill!

1222
01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:53.916
Indeed. Allah is with those

1223
01:51:53.958 --> 01:51:55.666
that are patient.

1224
01:51:57.208 --> 01:51:58.250
Sister. let me out.

1225
01:51:58.333 --> 01:51:59.750
This is not fair.

1226
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.208
No. my child.

1227
01:52:02.958 --> 01:52:04.833
It’s only the devil...

1228
01:52:04.916 --> 01:52:06.375
he is tempting you...

1229
01:52:06.541 --> 01:52:07.708
luring you.

1230
01:52:07.833 --> 01:52:09.208
Sister open the door.

1231
01:52:09.291 --> 01:52:11.083
I can't breathe.

1232
01:52:12.458 --> 01:52:14.625
You destroyed eight years of my life.

1233
01:52:14.791 --> 01:52:16.083
Why must I suffer more?

1234
01:52:16.166 --> 01:52:17.208
I was protecting you.

1235
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:18.708
Don’t scare me in the name of God.

1236
01:52:18.791 --> 01:52:19.833
You would've been ruined.

1237
01:52:19.875 --> 01:52:20.541
You lied for years.

1238
01:52:20.583 --> 01:52:21.166
You had nowhere to go.

1239
01:52:21.208 --> 01:52:22.416
Weren't you scared of God?

1240
01:52:22.458 --> 01:52:23.458
You had noone besides me!

1241
01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.083
Curse be on liars.

1242
01:52:25.291 --> 01:52:26.771
Allah is with those that are patient.

1243
01:52:26.833 --> 01:52:27.875
If you don't open the door

1244
01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:30.375
I will kill myself. Open it!

1245
01:52:31.375 --> 01:52:34.791
Allah is with those that are patient.

1246
01:53:39.041 --> 01:53:40.916
This...

1247
01:53:42.583 --> 01:53:44.833
this is a bottle of kerosene.

1248
01:53:45.333 --> 01:53:46.875
Sister let me out

1249
01:53:46.958 --> 01:53:48.708
or I will burn everything.

1250
01:53:50.166 --> 01:53:52.583
For the last time...

1251
01:53:52.875 --> 01:53:54.875
let me out or I will

1252
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.166
burn myself and this house!

1253
01:53:57.541 --> 01:53:59.541
Open the door!

1254
01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:10.833
Fine.

1255
01:54:11.583 --> 01:54:13.916
You won’t open the door...

1256
01:54:14.083 --> 01:54:16.541
I’m about to pour this kerosene.

1257
01:54:18.041 --> 01:54:21.708
I’m burning everything!

1258
01:54:43.291 --> 01:54:45.291
I've poured the kerosene...

1259
01:54:45.916 --> 01:54:47.000
on everything...

1260
01:54:47.041 --> 01:54:49.708
on myself and the whole room!

1261
01:54:54.541 --> 01:54:55.541
And this...

1262
01:54:55.916 --> 01:54:57.416
Matchbox!

1263
01:54:57.458 --> 01:54:59.916
I have a matchbox too!

1264
01:55:00.333 --> 01:55:01.573
I’m saying it for the last time

1265
01:55:01.625 --> 01:55:03.416
open the door!

1266
01:55:04.291 --> 01:55:06.625
Sister open the door...

1267
01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.291
or I’ll set fire to everything.

1268
01:55:11.166 --> 01:55:13.041
Sister open the door...

1269
01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:15.041
Sister open the door.

1270
01:55:15.666 --> 01:55:16.916
Open the door. now!

1271
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.750
Or I'll burn everything!

1272
01:56:02.583 --> 01:56:03.791
Fire!

1273
01:56:03.916 --> 01:56:06.791
Fire! Help!

1274
01:56:06.916 --> 01:56:08.208
Sister-in-law!

1275
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.291
Sister-in-law!

1276
01:56:11.416 --> 01:56:13.166
Open the door!

1277
01:56:13.375 --> 01:56:14.458
Sister-in-law!

1278
01:56:14.666 --> 01:56:16.333
I'm opening it. I'm opening it!

1279
01:56:16.416 --> 01:56:18.333
Help!

1280
01:56:18.416 --> 01:56:20.291
I'm opening it!

1281
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:26.541
Sister-in-law? Are you alright?

1282
01:56:27.333 --> 01:56:28.625
I've burnt it.

1283
01:56:29.041 --> 01:56:30.916
I've burnt everything.

1284
01:56:35.875 --> 01:56:37.333
Sister-in-law?

1285
01:56:37.458 --> 01:56:39.583
Where are you going right now?

1286
01:56:39.791 --> 01:56:41.250
Its so late. Stop!

1287
01:56:41.416 --> 01:56:43.083
Where are you going?

1288
01:56:56.416 --> 01:56:57.625
Sister-in-law?

1289
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:58.916
Sister-in-law?

1290
01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.833
Sister-in-law stop!

1291
01:57:02.916 --> 01:57:05.833
Fire! Somebody help!

1292
01:57:06.291 --> 01:57:07.625
Sister-in-law!

1293
01:57:07.875 --> 01:57:11.916
There's a fire! Help! Somebody?

1294
01:57:12.541 --> 01:57:13.666
Help! Anyone there?

1295
01:57:14.041 --> 01:57:16.708
<i>There’s a fire at Saqlain’s house!</i>

1296
01:57:16.958 --> 01:57:19.416
Oh no! Look look. over there!

1297
01:57:19.916 --> 01:57:21.333
<i>Come here!</i>

1298
01:57:21.416 --> 01:57:23.666
Help! Fire! Fire!

1299
01:57:25.166 --> 01:57:27.291
Hurry up. quickly!

1300
01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:30.333
Who is it? Fire!

1301
01:57:30.833 --> 01:57:32.916
Has anyone seen Hina?

1302
01:57:48.833 --> 01:57:49.875
Move fast!

1303
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.500
Why has she run off to the jungle?

1304
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I got very late. right?

1305
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:47.583
There was a fire.

1306
01:58:50.041 --> 01:58:52.791
My imprisonment is over.

1307
01:58:59.916 --> 01:59:02.708
Everything must have burnt by now.

1308
01:59:03.375 --> 01:59:05.166
Hmm...

1309
01:59:16.833 --> 01:59:18.666
Saqlain is dead.

1310
01:59:20.416 --> 01:59:22.416
He died.

1311
01:59:28.291 --> 01:59:32.333
I was afraid it might be too late.

1312
01:59:39.041 --> 01:59:40.333
Let's go.

1313
01:59:41.333 --> 01:59:43.666
Let's run away.

1314
01:59:46.541 --> 01:59:49.666
It's really late. It's a jungle...

1315
01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:52.666
What if a lion comes and attacks us?

1316
01:59:55.333 --> 01:59:58.166
They are also coming after me.

1317
02:00:07.208 --> 02:00:10.083
Come on. Amaltas...

1318
02:00:10.666 --> 02:00:12.416
Come on let's go.

1319
02:00:12.875 --> 02:00:14.166
Amaltas it's getting late.

1320
02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:16.541
They will be here. Let's go!

1321
02:00:16.708 --> 02:00:18.916
Amaltas. they will take me away.

1322
02:00:19.041 --> 02:00:20.958
They will make me marry Mr Malik!

1323
02:00:21.083 --> 02:00:22.208
They will lock me up!

1324
02:00:22.291 --> 02:00:23.625
Let's go Amaltas!

1325
02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:27.375
Amaltas?

1326
02:00:27.625 --> 02:00:29.208
<i>She went into this cottage.</i>

1327
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.333
<i>Hasn't it been empty for long?</i>

1328
02:00:31.541 --> 02:00:32.666
<i>Yes.</i>

1329
02:00:32.833 --> 02:00:34.250
<i>There could be snakes here.</i>

1330
02:00:34.375 --> 02:00:35.583
Keep moving!

1331
02:00:35.708 --> 02:00:37.250
We must find out

1332
02:00:37.375 --> 02:00:39.166
what she's doing inside!

1333
02:00:40.541 --> 02:00:42.041
Amaltas. they are here.

1334
02:00:42.208 --> 02:00:45.000
They will take me away. Amaltas!

1335
02:00:46.166 --> 02:00:48.083
Amaltas. let's go!

1336
02:00:48.333 --> 02:00:49.583
Get up! Amaltas!

1337
02:00:49.708 --> 02:00:51.000
Take me away from here!

1338
02:00:51.083 --> 02:00:52.625
I don't want to go with them!

1339
02:00:52.833 --> 02:00:55.083
Let's go. Amaltas!

1340
02:00:56.166 --> 02:00:57.666
What is she doing here?

1341
02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:59.666
I was already suspicious of her.

1342
02:00:59.833 --> 02:01:01.541
I’ve seen her going into

1343
02:01:01.625 --> 02:01:04.208
the jungle a few times.

1344
02:01:05.541 --> 02:01:07.708
<i>She must be having an affair.</i>

1345
02:01:07.833 --> 02:01:09.541
<i>I’m sure of it.</i>

1346
02:01:11.041 --> 02:01:12.041
Amaltas...

1347
02:01:40.666 --> 02:01:42.375
<i>Why are we standing around?</i>

1348
02:01:42.541 --> 02:01:43.541
<i>Let’s open the door!</i>

1349
02:01:52.333 --> 02:01:54.416
There's nobody in here.

1350
02:01:54.708 --> 02:01:56.458
Yes.

1351
02:03:17.666 --> 02:03:19.958
You're back. sister-in-law.

1352
02:03:23.666 --> 02:03:27.041
You're late again today.

1353
02:03:28.166 --> 02:03:30.458
How many times have I told you

1354
02:03:30.625 --> 02:03:33.541
to come back before sunset.

1355
02:03:52.666 --> 02:03:54.916
You’re very tired. aren’t you?

1356
02:04:01.041 --> 02:04:04.541
Your hair is all matted.

1357
02:04:06.291 --> 02:04:11.041
I’ll oil your hair in the morning.

1358
02:04:11.708 --> 02:04:12.916
Sister...

1359
02:04:13.375 --> 02:04:14.875
Hmm?

1360
02:04:15.291 --> 02:04:18.625
Last summer when I had fever

1361
02:04:20.041 --> 02:04:22.916
you told me a story...

1362
02:04:23.666 --> 02:04:26.291
about Princess Harmala.

1363
02:04:26.583 --> 02:04:29.083
She was very beautiful.

1364
02:04:29.833 --> 02:04:32.041
Behind her palace...

1365
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:35.875
there was a big jungle...

1366
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:39.625
that she would sneak off to...

1367
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:42.708
away there in the afternoons.

1368
02:04:43.208 --> 02:04:45.208
Her stepmother...

1369
02:04:45.375 --> 02:04:47.791
was very jealous of her...

1370
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.333
so she cast a spell on her...

1371
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:55.041
that if she ever touched flowing water

1372
02:04:55.166 --> 02:04:58.458
it would ruin her.

1373
02:04:59.958 --> 02:05:03.000
And then one day...

1374
02:05:03.125 --> 02:05:05.041
she stood there

1375
02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:07.791
away from the stream...

1376
02:05:07.916 --> 02:05:11.416
and she heard someone call her...

1377
02:05:11.708 --> 02:05:13.666
“Harmala...”

1378
02:05:15.333 --> 02:05:17.500
“Harmala...”

1379
02:05:19.083 --> 02:05:20.666
She realised that the voice

1380
02:05:20.791 --> 02:05:23.208
was coming from the water.

1381
02:05:23.666 --> 02:05:27.375
Suddenly. she stepped on a pebble and

1382
02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:30.958
she slipped and fell into the water!

1383
02:05:31.166 --> 02:05:33.541
She didn’t know how to swim.

1384
02:05:33.791 --> 02:05:38.125
The water started to swallow her.

1385
02:05:40.041 --> 02:05:41.791
Deeper...

1386
02:05:42.625 --> 02:05:44.916
deeper...

1387
02:05:46.166 --> 02:05:49.208
And then suddenly it felt like

1388
02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:53.166
someone with strong arms gripped her

1389
02:05:53.416 --> 02:05:56.625
and pulled her out of the water.

1390
02:05:59.333 --> 02:06:02.375
But before she could see

1391
02:06:02.583 --> 02:06:06.041
her saviour's face. she fainted.

1392
02:06:08.416 --> 02:06:11.416
When she regained consciousness

1393
02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:16.125
she was still there. in the jungle...

1394
02:06:17.416 --> 02:06:21.541
Under an Amaltas tree...

1395
02:06:23.125 --> 02:06:26.166
but he wasn't there!

1396
02:06:53.958 --> 02:06:56.333
She looked for her saviour

1397
02:06:56.458 --> 02:06:59.125
all over the jungle

1398
02:07:01.083 --> 02:07:03.500
but she never found him!

1399
02:07:05.041 --> 02:07:08.458
Every afternoon. she would go

1400
02:07:08.666 --> 02:07:11.791
and sit under the Amaltas tree...

1401
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:14.000
in the hope of catching

1402
02:07:14.083 --> 02:07:16.375
a glimpse of her saviour.

1403
02:07:20.416 --> 02:07:24.541
But she had touched the water!

1404
02:07:27.208 --> 02:07:29.333
Her stepmother cursed her...

1405
02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.125
remember?

1406
02:07:34.083 --> 02:07:37.416
The water destroyed her.

1407
02:07:39.166 --> 02:07:43.333
She became destined to

1408
02:07:43.458 --> 02:07:46.500
forever wait for him.

1409
02:07:50.166 --> 02:07:52.916
She is still sitting there...

1410
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:57.375
under the Amaltas tree.

1411
02:08:01.791 --> 02:08:03.166
Hmph!

1412
02:08:04.541 --> 02:08:06.166
Silly girl!

1413
02:08:32.375 --> 02:08:39.500
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1414
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.041
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1415
02:08:47.541 --> 02:08:54.083
<i>Dont walk away from me darling.</i>

1416
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.583
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1417
02:09:03.125 --> 02:09:09.041
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1418
02:09:12.833 --> 02:09:16.708
<i>It is but your name</i>

1419
02:09:16.875 --> 02:09:20.041
<i>written in my heart.</i>

1420
02:09:20.708 --> 02:09:24.166
<i>Written in my heart...</i>

1421
02:09:27.875 --> 02:09:31.750
<i>It is but your name</i>

1422
02:09:31.916 --> 02:09:35.083
<i>written in my heart...</i>

1423
02:09:35.458 --> 02:09:38.958
<i>Separated from you...</i>

1424
02:09:39.125 --> 02:09:42.833
<i>I am bound to die.</i>

1425
02:09:44.875 --> 02:09:48.375
<i>Separated from you...</i>

1426
02:09:48.541 --> 02:09:52.250
<i>I am bound to die.</i>

1427
02:09:52.666 --> 02:10:00.208
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1428
02:10:01.083 --> 02:10:08.791
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1429
02:10:10.333 --> 02:10:16.416
<i>Dont walk away from me darling.</i>

1430
02:10:17.125 --> 02:10:21.083
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1431
02:10:25.333 --> 02:10:30.083
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1432
02:10:35.250 --> 02:10:42.958
<i>You're in my thoughts forever.</i>

1433
02:10:43.208 --> 02:10:46.166
<i>Forever in my thoughts...</i>

1434
02:10:50.250 --> 02:10:57.041
<i>You're in my thoughts forever.</i>

1435
02:10:58.041 --> 02:11:04.833
<i>Together we look good dearest.</i>

1436
02:11:07.208 --> 02:11:14.500
<i>Together we look good dearest.</i>

1437
02:11:15.458 --> 02:11:22.541
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1438
02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:30.958
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1439
02:11:32.875 --> 02:11:39.708
<i>Don’t walk away from me darling.</i>

1440
02:11:41.416 --> 02:11:46.041
<i>All I have is you...</i>

1441
02:11:49.458 --> 02:11:54.833
<i>All I have is you...</i>
