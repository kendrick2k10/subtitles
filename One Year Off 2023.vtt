- Amen.
- Amen.

6
00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.437
I could always
visit you in Edinburgh.

7
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:17.093
But I love our sexy
<i>Notting Hill</i> weekends.
Don't you?

8
00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:20.401
Of course.
I love the movie.

9
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.620
I love that you
love the movie.

10
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.319
- I love our time together.
- You silly thing.

11
00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.452
You'll miss your plane.

12
00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:32.369
My friends say you've got
another woman back home

13
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.805
and three kids named Jock.

14
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.678
That is not true!

15
00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:38.549
It's five kids.

16
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.813
and only two of them
are named Jock.

17
00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.860
Who cares what your friends
say. anyway?

18
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.602
Well. I do. They're
the closest thing I have
to family--

19
00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:50.387
I get it. I get it.
I met them. remember?

20
00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:52.172
Ah. yes.

21
00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:54.870
I... I admit they were
a little off the charts

22
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.481
and possibly
off their meds.

23
00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:01.093
Are you sure you want us
to move in together?

24
00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.444
Of course I do. I...

25
00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:06.621
I just need a few months
to get things sorted out.

26
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.536
A few months?

27
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.625
You know. it only took them
six weeks to film
<i>Notting Hill.</i>

28
00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:12.627
- It's not that long.

29
00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:15.543
I know. I just...
I hate goodbyes

30
00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:17.458
and it just seems
like my life

31
00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:19.634
is permanently on hold
with customer services.

32
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.553
We'll fix that
as soon as I return.
my darling.

33
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.165
I'll come see you off.

34
00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:31.994
No. no. no. no.
You stay where you are.

35
00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:33.604
You know I hate goodbyes.

36
00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:38.392
I love you.

37
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.441
Claire Chambers.

38
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:46.487
I love you.

39
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:52.841
Is that your phone?

40
00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.670
Oh. no.

41
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.019
Richard!

42
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:10.119
- Ugh.

43
00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:22.827
Eww!

44
00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:25.090
Agh!

45
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.150
Claire. I'm in the middle
of a lesson.

46
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.934
It's happened again.

47
00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:44.327
What?

48
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:47.896
I need wisdom.
and wine. and chocolate.

49
00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:52.204
And tell Theo.
I need Theo.

50
00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:02.476
Hello. gorgeous.

51
00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:03.738
It's Claire.

52
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.915
What's the guy
done this time?

53
00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:08.699
We're on the break-up
duty again.

54
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.179
Been summoned
to the depression den.

55
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.616
Oh. it'll be
that ghastly Scotsman

56
00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:15.184
with his funny combover
and Windsor knots.

57
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.708
I knew this would happen.
I never trusted him.

58
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.406
He's got snake eyes.
I said to her.

59
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:20.581
"He's got snake eyes."

60
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:22.060
Theo!

61
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:23.366
Oh. calm down. bitch!
I'm already on my way.

62
00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:25.542
And I know.
bring chocolate.

63
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:31.592
- Um. how do you
not remember Richard?
- I...

64
00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:35.378
Clara. in my defense.

65
00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.988
there've been very. very. very

66
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.903
- many. many. many. many.
many men.
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:43.212
Not that many.
Just like five.

68
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.040
- This year.
- Okay. whatever.

69
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.172
I'm nearly 40.
I'm bound to have a history.

70
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:48.783
- Is that him?

71
00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:49.958
Is that the pig?

72
00:05:50.088 --> 00:05:52.308
Oh. it'll be
my friend Caroline.

73
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.093
Her wedding venue burned down.
She's hysterical.

74
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.270
At least she has a fiancé.

75
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.230
Well. this is clearly
all my fault.
What did I do wrong?

76
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.840
Oh. darling.
be like me.

77
00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:04.407
Take a vow of celibacy.

78
00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:05.669
Now...

79
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.062
Ooh.

80
00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:10.587
There.

81
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.285
Thanks.

82
00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:15.679
Oh. my God.

83
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.985
If that is your friend
with her wedding--

84
00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:19.770
- Oh. it's Ben.
- Oooh! Ben!

85
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:22.033
<i>Claire!
How are you. darling?</i>

86
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:25.080
-  Hey. Ben!
<i>- You're all there.</i>

87
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.212
We're all here.
We're on a. you know.
mercy mission.

88
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:28.562
<i>Hey. guys.</i>

89
00:06:28.692 --> 00:06:30.259
I'm sorry to interrupt.
but I'm calling you

90
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.914
'cause I got a little news
that I need to share with you.

91
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:34.655
Arnie Sandoval died.

92
00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:38.049
Oh. my God!
Arnie Sandoval died?!

93
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.183
Arnie... hmm.
Who is Arnie Sandoval?

94
00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:45.579
Apparently. he's
my biological father.

95
00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.581
- What?!
- What?!

96
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.061
Ben. you don't have
a father.

97
00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:52.237
I mean-- I mean.
who was he?

98
00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:55.937
He's from Saint Kitts and Nevis.
It's a-- it's a--

99
00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:58.766
<i>an island in the Caribbean.
the West Indies.</i>

100
00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:00.550
And apparently.
I'm his only heir

101
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.900
and I inherited his estate.

102
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:05.033
Wait. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:07.644
Ben. how do you feel
about all this?

104
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:10.473
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around this whole thing.

105
00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:12.736
I'm-- I'm a bit confused.

106
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:15.783
<i>And I need you guys.
I really do. I...</i>

107
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:17.437
I want you to come with me

108
00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:20.396
because I need to go down there
and sign some papers and--

109
00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:23.704
and. um. I don't think
I can do this thing alone.

110
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.054
<i>So. my dear friends.</i>

111
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:29.274
I'm asking you to go
on a little adventure with me.

112
00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:32.495
Oh. yes.
Yes. yes. yes.

113
00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.456
<i>I'll see you next week. guys.
I love you all. Thank you.</i>

114
00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:37.892
- Oh...
- Bye.

115
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.595
- Oh. my God! What?!

116
00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:56.824
Ben Katzman.

117
00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:01.306
You lucky bastard.

118
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:04.571
Baby. what's up?

119
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:06.398
Nothing. darling.
Go back to sleep.

120
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:09.097
Mm. Who called so early?

121
00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:10.359
It was Ben.

122
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.971
He just inherited
some property
in the Caribbean.

123
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:16.191
Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:19.629
He wants to know
if we'd like to go
for a week's vacation there.

125
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.024
Well. who wouldn't?

126
00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:24.982
He's paying for everything.

127
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:27.898
What? What?
Are you serious?

128
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:29.596
- Oh. my God.
- Seriously.

129
00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:32.947
- Seriously.

130
00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:34.688
He's inviting Alex.

131
00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:36.820
Are you okay with that?

132
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:38.387
Of course
I'm okay with that.

133
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.782
Why wouldn't I be?
You married me.

134
00:08:45.612 --> 00:08:47.614
- Does that mean--
- Yes!

135
00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:49.180
Yes. baby. We're going.

136
00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:05.022
Baby. you look amazing.

137
00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:08.809
She's gotta stop
taking selfies.

138
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.421
There they are!
Well. hey!

139
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.075
Claire! Theo!

140
00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:20.298
Oh. my God!

141
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:33.050
-  Oh. my God!
- Thank you so much
for being here.

142
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:35.749
You look so beautiful.
Thank you all.
you all look beautiful.

143
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.620
I have an announcement
to make.

144
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.057
Claire is no longer
in the market for love.

145
00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:41.319
and Alex is just here
for sex.

146
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.538
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.105
And by the way.
the driver looks good.

148
00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:47.543
Hello. sir!
Hello!

149
00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:49.197
Oh. Theo. you old queen!
Come here.

150
00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:51.416
Oh. oh. Stop it.
stop it. stop it.

151
00:09:51.547 --> 00:09:52.896
Don't stop it!
Don't stop it!

152
00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.986
Megan. your husband
just assaulted me.

153
00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:58.380
Oh. no. I'm sure
he was just kidding.

154
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.903
Ba-baby. tell him
you're just kidding.

155
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:02.079
Baby. it's a joke.

156
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.864
Come on. guys! Let's get
on the boat. Here we go.

157
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:05.343
- Yes!
- Let's go!

158
00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:06.388
Oh. my God!

159
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:43.077
<i>Welcome to Nevis.
Charlie Brooks.
your father's lawyer.</i>

160
00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:44.513
We spoke on the phone.

161
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.515
Yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you. sir.

162
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.169
Hello. Charlie.

163
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:31.342
Oh. Ben.
It's beautiful.

164
00:11:38.219 --> 00:11:40.134
I love it.

165
00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:44.225
Oh. my God.
It's so beautiful. babe.

166
00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:46.357
All the pretty trees!

167
00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:56.890
Ben Katzman.

168
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.022
You're a lucky bastard.

169
00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:01.242
If I were you.
I'd stay here forever.

170
00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:03.244
Look who's here.
They're here.

171
00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:04.636
-  Hello.
- Hi.

172
00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:06.029
- Welcome. Mr. Katzman.
- Hi. Hi.

173
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.075
I'm Sheldon.
your father's butler.

174
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:10.033
and this is
my wife. Lois.

175
00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:12.079
- Hello. It's such a pleasure
to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

176
00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:13.776
- This place is--
- Magical.

177
00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.560
Magical. Yes. it is.

178
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:18.476
Mr. Katzman. my wife and I
are deeply sorry
for your loss.

179
00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.740
I'm so. so sorry to interrupt.

180
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.829
but I really have
to use the bathroom.

181
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.482
- I'll take you.
- Okay. Thank you.

182
00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:26.354
And please. I'm sorry.
but I'm dying for a shower.

183
00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:27.703
It's way too hot for me.

184
00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.705
Yeah. I'll take you
to your room.

185
00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:31.751
- Are you Claire?
- Yes. I am.

186
00:12:31.881 --> 00:12:33.535
Nice to meet you.
And are you Theo?

187
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:34.797
- I am.
- Yes.

188
00:12:34.928 --> 00:12:37.539
You are staying
at the beach club. Okay?

189
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.280
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

190
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.195
- All right. Come on.
ladies. This way.
- Okay. Okay.

191
00:12:41.325 --> 00:12:42.587
- Bye. baby.
- Bye-bye.

192
00:12:42.718 --> 00:12:43.850
Come on. Come on.

193
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.874
Hm.

194
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.966
And you must be Ben.

195
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.841
I'm Ashley.
I manage the beach club.

196
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:20.669
I guess you met
my mum and dad.

197
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.411
I'm Claire.
Ashley. did you say?

198
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:24.891
Yes.

199
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.068
Say something.

200
00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:29.417
I'm Ben.

201
00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:10.839
- Hey. baby.
- Hey. baby.

202
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.406
It's really hot.
I'm gonna go take a shower

203
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:14.321
and get changed.
You gonna come?

204
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:16.062
No. I'm gonna stay here
for a while.

205
00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:18.238
Okay. Mwah.

206
00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:22.894
How's the club doing?
Has it changed?

207
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:26.898
No. Well. it's dingier.

208
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:29.292
We're only open
twice a week now.
post-COVID.

209
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.773
You know. George and Alex
were the big pull
back in the day.

210
00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:33.383
When Theo and I were waiters.

211
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:35.211
we could barely
get across the room.
It was packed.

212
00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:36.560
Yeah.

213
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:38.736
Well. the world's changed.
We've changed.

214
00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:41.913
Have we?

215
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.176
Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:49.138
I'm glad
you're happy. George.

217
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.358
We are... happy.

218
00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:53.447
Well. I mean. she is.

219
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.321
Look. I know she's
a bit of an Energizer bunny.
and I'm not.

220
00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:00.497
Well. I mean...

221
00:17:00.628 --> 00:17:02.021
I used to be relentless
back in the day.

222
00:17:03.152 --> 00:17:04.893
Hey. don't even say it.

223
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.982
Oh. Georgie. please.

224
00:17:07.113 --> 00:17:11.160
I'm just laying here.
biting my tongue
like a good friend.

225
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.771
Look. she's not as bad
as you think she is. okay?

226
00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.512
Oh. George. No one
was thinking that.

227
00:17:15.643 --> 00:17:17.993
- You said it. Not me.
-  Alex.

228
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:20.343
retract the claws
for once. Okay?

229
00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:23.651
Ah. leave her. Theo.
It's gonna come out
at some point.

230
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:26.654
You love her. George.
and that's all that matters.

231
00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:28.743
- Thank you.
-  I mean. come on. guys.

232
00:17:28.873 --> 00:17:30.962
It can't be easy for her.
Look at us.

233
00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.661
We've known each other
for over 15 years.

234
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.055
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen.

235
00:17:38.927 --> 00:17:39.884
We're old.

236
00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:43.801
I need a drink!

237
00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:47.196
- Hm.

238
00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:28.803
This is Chrishi Beach.
and it's all yours now. Ben.

239
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:34.156
Yeah. I think I...

240
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:36.115
I'm gonna need a drink.

241
00:18:36.245 --> 00:18:37.681
Pick your poison.

242
00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:40.684
So where are we staying?

243
00:18:40.815 --> 00:18:42.730
Oh. the beach house.
It's just over there.

244
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.949
- Theo!
- Bye!

245
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.212
Bye.

246
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:50.477
Oh-ho. Oof.

247
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:53.393
Robyn makes
the best cocktails
on the island.

248
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:56.309
Robyn. meet Ben.
He's the new owner.

249
00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:58.398
And these are his friends.
Megan and George.

250
00:18:58.528 --> 00:19:00.835
Welcome to The Love Shack
Bar. guys.

251
00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:03.054
- What can I get you?
-  Hi.

252
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:06.928
I would love
a frozen margarita.

253
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.933
George. this is not Cancun.
This is Nevis.

254
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.500
I can do better than that.

255
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.371
Well. fantastic.
Surprise us. please.

256
00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:17.286
Sounds good.
Coming right up.

257
00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:19.984
I'm gonna go dance. baby.
Come with me. Mwah.

258
00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:21.334
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

259
00:19:22.639 --> 00:19:24.032
I'm going dancing.

260
00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:43.573
Ugh. Disgusting.

261
00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:45.096
Hate it.
This won't do at all.

262
00:19:45.227 --> 00:19:46.663
Absolutely not.

263
00:19:46.794 --> 00:19:50.189
I'm going back to my cozy
kitchen-bathroom combo.

264
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.082
- Ah!
- Who says you get
the best bedroom. bitch?

265
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:07.614
Hi.

266
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:09.572
Oh. my God. Claire!

267
00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:12.923
My bed feels like I'm sleeping
on Burt Reynolds'
chest hair-- lo.

268
00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:14.664
I'm Harry. I...
I work at the club.

269
00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:17.145
I didn't know
you guys arrived.
You need anything?

270
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.539
No. thank you.
We're perfectly okay.

271
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:22.933
Well. I shall have
to call you Prince Harry.

272
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:25.588
for you are
a prince among men.

273
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.331
Prince Harry? Okay.

274
00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:32.682
Well. I'll be at the club
if you do need anything.

275
00:21:32.813 --> 00:21:35.381
Well. thank you. my prince.

276
00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:41.648
Woman!
I know that look.

277
00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:44.172
I don't want to slap you.
but I will.

278
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.217
You're thinking
of falling for that tall.

279
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:49.395
impossibly good-looking man
with the perfect ass.
aren't you?

280
00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:53.877
No. definitely not.
Not interested at all.

281
00:21:54.008 --> 00:21:57.054
Sure. he's handsome. articulate.

282
00:21:57.185 --> 00:22:00.057
age-appropriate.
and apparently
gainfully employed.

283
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:03.887
But I'm over men.
I'm just here
to focus on me.

284
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:06.237
Okay. now how many times
have we heard that?

285
00:22:07.761 --> 00:22:08.805
Ah!

286
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:15.856
I've never liked you!
Got my hair wet.

287
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:27.563
Oh. and that guy
was shouting at you
because you were wearing fur.

288
00:22:27.694 --> 00:22:28.782
Oh. my God!

289
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:31.567
Yes! And he was like.

290
00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:34.483
"What poor creature had to die
for you to wear this coat?!"

291
00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:36.267
- And you said?
- "My Aunt Vera."

292
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.357
"May she rest in peace!"

293
00:22:38.487 --> 00:22:40.924
And. Theo. you were under
the table. What were you
doing under there?

294
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:43.579
- Come on. What were you doing?
-  Oh. no! You're doing
all my questions!

295
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.538
It was me.
Remember the heels?

296
00:22:45.668 --> 00:22:47.844
- Oh. the big ones!
They were gorgeous.
- They were gorgeous!

297
00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:50.847
But they were 7" heels.
I twisted my ankle.
my right ankle.

298
00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:53.981
The osteria was to the left.
I could only turn right. right?

299
00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:56.549
So. I'm under the table.
My leg is like this high.

300
00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:59.726
- Who's there with me
under the table?

301
00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:01.554
- Georgie!
- You lie.

302
00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:03.860
You lie.

303
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:04.905
What was the owner's name?

304
00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:07.081
Luigi!

305
00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:10.084
God. it was too good.
It was too good.

306
00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:12.216
But seriously.
that poor guy.

307
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:14.044
- But didn't he try
to throw us out?
- Baby...

308
00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:16.917
Yeah. Because--
would you blame him?
We were too noisy!

309
00:23:17.047 --> 00:23:19.963
Baby? I'm--
I'm gonna have
to step away. okay?

310
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:21.312
- Okay.
-  Could you blame him?

311
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:22.966
I mean.
come on.

312
00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:24.664
Yeah. but that's when we
pretended that we got married.

313
00:23:24.794 --> 00:23:26.492
I had too much fun.

314
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:28.581
And then-- we were
at each other's throats
out at the club.

315
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:29.843
That was amazing.

316
00:23:29.973 --> 00:23:31.453
How long do you all know
each other for?

317
00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:33.455
- Too long.
- Oh. gosh. Way too long.

318
00:23:33.586 --> 00:23:36.763
This one is the older brother
that I never had.

319
00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:39.287
Oh. I love you too.

320
00:23:42.246 --> 00:23:43.596
Hello.

321
00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:45.641
Charlie?

322
00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:47.991
I thought we were gonna
meet tomorrow.

323
00:23:48.122 --> 00:23:51.430
Yes. but I thought
I'd abandoned you
somewhat earlier.

324
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.390
So. I saw the house lit up.
I said. "Why not?"

325
00:23:56.913 --> 00:24:01.352
Like the good old days.
The parties. the hijinks.
the goings-on.

326
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:07.141
I just need your signature
and a witness.

327
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:08.882
Perhaps
your charming friend.

328
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:16.455
I'd love to.

329
00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:20.415
How to get a witness.

330
00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:22.112
- Hey. to the witness!

331
00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:24.637
- To the gorgeous witness.
-  Witness!

332
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:29.163
I just love
your cooking. Ooh.

333
00:24:29.293 --> 00:24:31.252
-  Georgie. you...

334
00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:34.995
Mm. That is fabulous.
What is that?

335
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.562
- It's my secret.
- Will you teach me?

336
00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:38.477
I wanna learn
how to cook like you.

337
00:24:38.607 --> 00:24:39.869
Of course I will. honey.

338
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.838
So many nights...

339
00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:57.017
your father and I
would sit here.
drink rum.

340
00:24:57.147 --> 00:25:01.151
and have endless discussions
about life.

341
00:25:02.196 --> 00:25:03.632
The papers.

342
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.898
Now. I have already marked
the signature pages

343
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:11.640
for you and the witness
to sign.

344
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.612
Very good. Now.
when we spoke on the phone.

345
00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:31.225
you expressed a desire
to perhaps sell the estate?

346
00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:33.009
Of course.
I can assist you with that.

347
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.881
if that's
your intention.

348
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:37.057
Uh. well.
about that...
I just. uh...

349
00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:40.539
I think I'm gonna need
a couple days to think
about that.

350
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:44.368
This is huge.
Of course you need
time to think.

351
00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:49.025
Yes. take your time.

352
00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:51.419
Meanwhile. enjoy
our beautiful island.

353
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.117
And if you decide to sell.

354
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:57.904
there are already several
very interested buyers.

355
00:25:58.034 --> 00:25:59.514
Really?

356
00:26:00.994 --> 00:26:02.778
Could you give us
a moment. please?

357
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.084
Of course.

358
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.566
Thank you.

359
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:16.575
- How do you feel?
- I feel pretty good.
I guess.

360
00:26:18.838 --> 00:26:21.188
More important question is.
Claire. how do you feel?

361
00:26:25.888 --> 00:26:27.542
I need a reset.

362
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.981
All these years of trying
to find love...

363
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.421
I'm done. I just need
to focus on me.

364
00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:39.859
I'm so happy you're here
with me. Thank you.

365
00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:41.295
Me too.

366
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.301
So that's him?

367
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:49.738
Yeah. that's him.

368
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.308
I wish I knew
what he had in mind for me.

369
00:26:54.438 --> 00:26:56.571
I don't know what he's got
on his mind.

370
00:26:56.702 --> 00:27:00.575
but I know you've got
Ashley on yours.

371
00:27:02.969 --> 00:27:05.014
Ashley?

372
00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.537
Well. she is--

373
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:07.930
Ravishing?

374
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:10.933
Yes. exactly.
And she's too young for me.

375
00:27:11.064 --> 00:27:13.762
No. she's my age.
I already asked.

376
00:27:13.893 --> 00:27:15.546
And that would be 34?

377
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:18.549
Yes. I have been
for the past five years.

378
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.073
and I intend to stay there.

379
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:24.773
Oh. I've missed you
so much.

380
00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:26.253
I missed you too.

381
00:27:27.428 --> 00:27:29.038
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

382
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:39.570
Oof.

383
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:43.705
- Be happy.
- I am.

384
00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:49.276
Yeah.
but you were so drunk.
you fell off your chair.

385
00:27:49.406 --> 00:27:51.670
Ha! I'm Russian.
I feel [speaks Russian].

386
00:27:53.323 --> 00:27:54.455
Ben.

387
00:27:56.065 --> 00:27:57.371
This one's for you.
my friend.

388
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.029

Bravo. Bravo.

407
00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:44.652
Daddy...

408
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.350
- Can you relax. please?
- I am relaxed.

409
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:49.962
Right. I can see that.

410
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.702
They're good guys.

411
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.924
I think he's getting ready
to sell Golden Rock.

412
00:29:56.055 --> 00:30:00.146
- I can feel it.
- Don't be so pessimistic.

413
00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:03.236
Just let them enjoy
their time here.

414
00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:06.369
Daddy? Please?

415
00:30:18.773 --> 00:30:20.557
I'd like to make a toast.

416
00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.562
To Arnie Sandoval.

417
00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:07.256
Arnie would have...
he would have just loved this!

418
00:31:09.563 --> 00:31:11.304
What was he really like?

419
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:13.872
The man was a legend.

420
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.963
It would take days
to do him justice.

421
00:31:18.093 --> 00:31:20.356
Just a remarkable fellow.

422
00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:23.359
When I first came here
from the States.

423
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.274
Arnie helped me
get set up here.

424
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:28.625
He was like... the mayor.

425
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.149
the don of the island.

426
00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:32.325
the pope of the Caribbean.

427
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:36.895
I owe him everything.

428
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:42.465
It's peaceful here.

429
00:31:45.077 --> 00:31:49.168
Nevis is a place where peace
and harmony is everything.

430
00:31:56.784 --> 00:31:57.741
Charlie...

431
00:31:59.308 --> 00:32:01.876
Do a lot of people
come to the island
just to get married?

432
00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:06.359
Dozens of marriages.
maybe dozens of dozens.

433
00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:10.841
And that includes
quite a few pitched in
by yours truly.

434
00:32:10.972 --> 00:32:15.934
I've married and divorced
four Mrs. Brooks
on this very island.

435
00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:18.327
If you're gonna have
miserable divorces.

436
00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:21.113
you may as well have
magical weddings.

437
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.466
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

438
00:32:28.685 --> 00:32:29.948
Come on.

439
00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:34.953
You're impossible.

440
00:32:37.172 --> 00:32:39.827
- What are you
smiling about?

441
00:32:41.655 --> 00:32:44.788
I'm thinking
about how lucky I am...

442
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:47.574
right now in this moment.
in this place.

443
00:32:47.704 --> 00:32:48.879
Right here.

444
00:32:49.706 --> 00:32:52.753
I finally found out
who my father was.

445
00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:55.364
where I came from.

446
00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:57.627
Sitting here
in this beautiful place...

447
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.023
with my dearest friends
in the world.

448
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.331
Yeah. I'm lucky.

449
00:33:06.941 --> 00:33:08.856
And I just wish
it would never end.

450
00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:10.989
What if it doesn't have to?

451
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:13.252
What if we just... stay?

452
00:33:14.514 --> 00:33:15.863
A little tipsy. Claire?

453
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.387
I'm drunk. but not on rum.

454
00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:20.041
Must be the beer.

455
00:33:20.172 --> 00:33:22.130
No. It's this place.
It's this moment.

456
00:33:22.261 --> 00:33:23.871
I'm drunk
on the possibilities.

457
00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.003
What possibilities?

458
00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:26.743
Of us being here together.

459
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:29.311
What if we open
a wedding business?

460
00:33:29.442 --> 00:33:31.748
You are drunk.

461
00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:32.923
No. think about it.

462
00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:35.491
- "Paradise Weddings."
- Claire.

463
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:37.667
I'm happy. finally.

464
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:41.193
It took me six years
of therapy after my divorce.

465
00:33:41.323 --> 00:33:43.195
I--

466
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:46.154
I don't believe in marriage.
and I don't think
you believe in it either.

467
00:33:46.285 --> 00:33:48.548
I have to believe in them.

468
00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:50.637
Please.

469
00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:56.382
You got the floor.

470
00:33:57.426 --> 00:33:59.428
Guys! Guys. okay.
I've got an idea.

471
00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:02.083
And I know
it's gonna sound crazy.
but just please hear me out.

472
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:04.955
What would you say
about staying here?

473
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.740
- She's drunk.
- Just for a while...

474
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.090
for a few months
or like a year.

475
00:34:09.221 --> 00:34:11.092
just so that we can be
together again.

476
00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:14.313
and just live.
and love. and laugh.

477
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:17.316
- and have fun. and breathe.
-  I love it!

478
00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:19.144
- Doing what?
-  Yeah.

479
00:34:19.274 --> 00:34:21.059
Romantic weddings
at the beach club.

480
00:34:21.189 --> 00:34:23.496
- Oh.
- Just think about it.

481
00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:27.978
The sand. and the sun. and--
and the ocean. and romance.

482
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:29.893
It's perfect.

483
00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:32.940
And come on. none of us are
particularly happy right now.

484
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.333
- Oh. well--

485
00:34:34.463 --> 00:34:35.812
You might want
to speak for yourself.

486
00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:38.293
because George and I are
really happy together.

487
00:34:39.468 --> 00:34:40.469
Urgh.

488
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.949
Okay. well.
I'm not happy.

489
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.473
And I think I speak
for most of us

490
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:46.084
when I say we hate our jobs.

491
00:34:46.214 --> 00:34:49.696
And I hate being single
in my stupid flat in London.

492
00:34:49.826 --> 00:34:52.568
And. Theo and Alex. I know
that you guys feel
the same way.

493
00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:56.311
- Yeah.
- So. what if we
just start fresh here?

494
00:34:56.442 --> 00:34:58.748
I'll put it to the guys.
What do you think?

495
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:00.098
What do we think?

496
00:35:00.228 --> 00:35:01.751
Claire. come on.

497
00:35:01.882 --> 00:35:04.232
What on Earth
do any of us know
about weddings?

498
00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:05.799
I mean. we're not exactly.

499
00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:08.149
you know. shining example
of marital bliss here. okay?

500
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.542
- Hmm.

501
00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:11.805
Oh. come on. babe.
Look at the rest of us.

502
00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:15.025
I mean. single. Single.
Celibate nymphomaniac...

503
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.853
- Ah!
- ...which is a hell
of a condition.

504
00:35:16.984 --> 00:35:18.246
but we're still miserable.

505
00:35:18.377 --> 00:35:20.074
Yeah.
But look. come on.

506
00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:21.945
Even if that was the case.
I mean. we can't
just up sticks.

507
00:35:22.076 --> 00:35:24.905
- and just leave
everything behind.
- Yeah.

508
00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:26.472
But why not?

509
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:29.736
Come on!
This place is special.

510
00:35:29.866 --> 00:35:32.739
Megan. you heard
how George sang tonight.

511
00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:34.828
That's the George
we know and love.

512
00:35:36.003 --> 00:35:37.744
And. Alex. come on.

513
00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:39.093
Do you really want to be
teaching Chopin

514
00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:41.443
to spoiled rich kids forever?
You hate it.

515
00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:43.706
It's true. I do hate it.

516
00:35:43.837 --> 00:35:46.405
And. Theo.
you haven't even touched
your camera for two years.

517
00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:48.581
and you have nothing
to go back for.

518
00:35:48.711 --> 00:35:51.105
Wow! Tell it like it is.

519
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:54.891
I mean. how do you
propose to do this plan?

520
00:35:55.022 --> 00:35:57.024
Well. um. I could do
the marketing.

521
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:59.722
and-- and Ben can be
the host with the most.

522
00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:01.202
like he was back in the day.

523
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:04.553
And every wedding.
I guess. needs music. so...

524
00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:06.990
- Yes!
- And I suppose I could
do some singing.

525
00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:08.253
<i>♪ Look for... ♪</i>

526
00:36:08.383 --> 00:36:10.777
And I can prepare
the food with Lois!

527
00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:12.474
I could be a bridesmaid!

528
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:14.824
- Or... ?
- Or I could take
the photographs.

529
00:36:14.955 --> 00:36:17.523
If it's of any help.
I'm an ordained minister.

530
00:36:17.653 --> 00:36:20.047
I always knew it would
come in handy one day.

531
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.267
It's perfect!
We could totally do this!

532
00:36:22.397 --> 00:36:24.704
We can totally do this.
Please say yes. please.

533
00:36:24.834 --> 00:36:26.314
Please. please. please.

534
00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:34.453
To one year off!

535
00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:45.812
- What's going on?
- Looks like we're staying.

536
00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:22.185
Hi. Claire.

537
00:39:22.316 --> 00:39:24.971
You're blocking
my view. Barry.

538
00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:37.940
By the way. it's Harry.

539
00:39:38.071 --> 00:39:41.683
Right. So.
is this your job?

540
00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:44.860
Kind of.

541
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:47.428
I've been working at the club
ever since I drifted
into this paradise.

542
00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:50.039
Sheldon. Lois and Ashley
are like family to me.

543
00:39:51.824 --> 00:39:54.043
That's very nice
to hear. Larry.

544
00:39:56.176 --> 00:39:57.307
It's Harry.

545
00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:58.570
Sorry?

546
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.399
Never mind.

547
00:40:02.704 --> 00:40:04.314
So. Ashley tells me
that you and your friends

548
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:06.316
are going to be here
for a whole year.

549
00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:10.146
Maybe. I didn't pack
my crystal ball.

550
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:13.628
Well. you could always borrow
my Magic 8-Ball in a pinch.

551
00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:17.197
That's a good joke. Jerry.

552
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:21.810
It's still Harry.

553
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.551
That it is.

554
00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:27.076
Well. okay then.
I'm gonna get back
to the club.

555
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.167
I'm just gonna lie here
for a bit longer.

556
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:32.473
Bye. Claire.

557
00:40:58.586 --> 00:40:59.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:40:59.805 --> 00:41:01.720
I was wondering.
have you seen my wife?

559
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.765
Uh. yeah. She went
to the market with Lois.

560
00:41:03.896 --> 00:41:04.984
Oh. good.

561
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:09.205
This is the best.

562
00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:10.642
I found my father's diaries.

563
00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:12.513
- Yeah?
- Ooh.

564
00:41:12.644 --> 00:41:15.385
Here. have a read.
Just read anything.

565
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:21.261
"Last night.
Rudy Nureyev--"

566
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:23.089
- Nureyev?
- Nureyev.

567
00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:26.919
"...came over. Such a hoot.

568
00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:29.748
We drank too much vodka
and I beat him at whist.

569
00:41:29.878 --> 00:41:32.838
His ankle was swollen.
and I made him sit with it
above his head.

570
00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:35.536
because it always
does the trick."

571
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:38.234
- Really. Nureyev?
- Nureyev.

572
00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:41.368
Turns out that my father
truly was a legendary person.

573
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.718
Everything everybody's saying
about him is true.

574
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:46.155
I mean. he knew everybody.
I'm talking everybody.

575
00:41:46.286 --> 00:41:48.070
He knew Khrushchev.
Che Guevara.

576
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.160
He talks about rolling cigars
with Fidel Castro.

577
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:52.771
- Castro?
- Yeah. Castro.

578
00:41:52.901 --> 00:41:55.730
- Really?
- It's incredible.
But my favorite...

579
00:41:55.861 --> 00:41:59.342
He knew Ernest Hemingway personally.

580
00:41:59.473 --> 00:42:01.301
He talks about swapping
mojito recipes

581
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:03.303
with Ernest friggin' Hemingway.

582
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:07.829
And let me tell you.
there's tons of this stuff.
I mean. it's everything--

583
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.267
it's important.
it's funny. it's fascinating.

584
00:42:11.398 --> 00:42:13.139
I mean. fascinating.

585
00:42:15.402 --> 00:42:17.796
- Hemingway? Hmm.
- Hemingway.

586
00:42:33.202 --> 00:42:36.162
Hold my <i>matryoshkas</i> .
Gentlemen. hello.

587
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:38.947
- Hey. how are you doing?
- Oh. I'm doing
just fine. thank you.

588
00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:40.079
Have a nice day.

589
00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:42.864
Well. you're going young.
aren't you?

590
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:45.563
First of all.
they are in their early 20s.

591
00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:50.089
and I am in my early
to [coughs] mid-40s. Okay?

592
00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:52.395
- Cougar.
- Yeah. And your point?

593
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.443
Oh. excuse me.
He is very cute.

594
00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:01.796
- Go easy on my guests.
- Oh. please stop.

595
00:43:01.927 --> 00:43:03.232
You know me.
I'm just looking.

596
00:43:03.363 --> 00:43:06.801
Hey! And I'm liking.

597
00:43:08.281 --> 00:43:09.412
Claire?

598
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:12.502
Hello. sweetheart.

599
00:43:13.852 --> 00:43:15.375
About last night...

600
00:43:15.505 --> 00:43:17.072
- Yes?
- Um...

601
00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:20.554
Maybe we should hammer out
some of those ideas you have.

602
00:43:22.774 --> 00:43:25.254
I was worried you might have
changed your mind
after the alcohol evaporated.

603
00:43:25.385 --> 00:43:28.649
No. I've never been more sure
of anything in my life. Claire.

604
00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:30.782
Me too.

605
00:43:33.001 --> 00:43:35.613
- Well. first things first.
- What?

606
00:43:37.049 --> 00:43:39.747
Well. now we have to find
someone who wants
to get married.

607
00:43:39.878 --> 00:43:42.881
Oh. Funny
you should say that.

608
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:47.668
Caroline!
I know. I'm sorry.

609
00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:50.105
No. I...
I wasn't ignoring you.

610
00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:51.498
I should have
called you back.

611
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.631
But I'm calling you now.

612
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:58.418
Yes. I know. Awful.
I'm so sorry.

613
00:43:58.548 --> 00:44:01.203
Yes. But listen. Caroline.

614
00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:04.337
What would you say
to a romantic wedding

615
00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:07.732
on the most beautiful beach
in the world?

616
00:44:07.862 --> 00:44:10.865
That's the thing.
It <i>could</i> happen.

617
00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:12.388
I could <i>make it</i> happen.

618
00:44:19.265 --> 00:44:21.006
We've got
our first customer. guys.

619
00:44:22.964 --> 00:44:25.010
We are open for business.

620
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.229

We are gathered here

664
00:48:58.022 --> 00:49:00.633
to witness the marriage
of Caroline...

665
00:49:01.764 --> 00:49:03.070
and Alan.

666
00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:05.943
And what a lovely vision
you are. Caroline.

667
00:49:06.073 --> 00:49:07.292
- Thank you.
- And you. Alan.

668
00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:09.729
Reminds me
of my last wedding.

669
00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:11.383
Bittersweet memories.

670
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.559
But this is your wedding.

671
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:16.214
I can't imagine
that there any objections?

672
00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:20.261
No? Alrighty. then.

673
00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:21.654
Caroline.

674
00:49:21.784 --> 00:49:26.224
do you take Alan
to be your loving husband.

675
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:30.271
loving him in sickness
and in health.
richer or poorer?

676
00:49:30.402 --> 00:49:31.620
I do.

677
00:49:38.453 --> 00:49:39.672
And you. Alan.

678
00:49:39.802 --> 00:49:42.327
do you take Caroline
to be your loving wife.

679
00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:46.418
loving her and cherishing her.

680
00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:49.203
but also good to obey her?

681
00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:54.252
Obey more than cherish.
That's my two cents.

682
00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:55.514
I do.

683
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:05.567
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

684
00:50:05.698 --> 00:50:07.091
You may kiss the bride.

685
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.847
Claire.
this is for you.

686
00:50:24.978 --> 00:50:27.633
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no.

687
00:50:27.763 --> 00:50:30.288
No...

688
00:51:01.623 --> 00:51:03.843
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

689
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.630
To us.

690
00:51:26.387 --> 00:51:27.954
- Clara.
- Alex.

691
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:40.880
Whoo!

692
00:51:45.798 --> 00:51:48.148
Congratulations
to the happy couple!

693
00:51:48.279 --> 00:51:50.368
-  Congratulations.
-  Congratulations.

694
00:51:53.327 --> 00:51:55.024
Caroline...

695
00:51:55.155 --> 00:51:56.722
- I love you.
- I love you.

696
00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:45.945
I think
we pulled that off.

697
00:52:46.075 --> 00:52:47.599
You did good.

698
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:52.908
And you're not as annoying
as I thought you would be.

699
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.869
Sorry about
the bouquet thing.

700
00:52:58.305 --> 00:53:00.394
I was trying really hard
not to catch it.

701
00:53:00.525 --> 00:53:03.441
That was
pretty obvious.

702
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:04.746
Why?

703
00:53:04.877 --> 00:53:06.270
Mm. hold my rum.

704
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.577
I have stories and they are
not fairy tales...

705
00:53:11.362 --> 00:53:14.016
which is probably
why we got off
on the wrong foot.

706
00:53:14.147 --> 00:53:16.802
Did we?
I hadn't noticed.

707
00:53:19.457 --> 00:53:21.981
- So. I have a question.
- That sounds serious.

708
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.810
Where do you live?

709
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.334
I mean. you just show up
at the club every afternoon.

710
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:30.076
Are you yet another man
leading a shady double life?

711
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.905
I am. I am married.

712
00:53:33.035 --> 00:53:35.908
and I take care of my five
children in the morning.

713
00:53:36.038 --> 00:53:37.605
All called Jock. I bet.

714
00:53:37.736 --> 00:53:41.392
No. no. no. They're all
named Barry Jr.

715
00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:46.962
I'm not buying it.
You're not the marrying type.

716
00:53:47.093 --> 00:53:48.573
I like to think that I am.

717
00:53:48.703 --> 00:53:52.490
I've just committed
too much time to my work.

718
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.667
Oh. so you have a job
other than bumming
around the club?

719
00:53:55.797 --> 00:53:59.410
I do. and I have Ashley
to thank for that.

720
00:54:02.456 --> 00:54:05.938
So. you and Ashley
are close?

721
00:54:06.068 --> 00:54:09.463
We are. We share
the same passion.

722
00:54:09.594 --> 00:54:12.161
And that passion happens to be
what I do in the morning.

723
00:54:12.292 --> 00:54:15.991
Well. my. my. Aren't we
being mysterious?

724
00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:24.304
One day. when you're
not too busy planning ways

725
00:54:24.435 --> 00:54:25.610
to make other people happy.

726
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.743
and maybe you want to make
yourself happy.

727
00:54:28.874 --> 00:54:31.268
would you like to see
where I disappear to
in the morning?

728
00:54:34.314 --> 00:54:35.620
Nah. I'm over it.

729
00:55:04.779 --> 00:55:08.000
- What was that for?
- Mm. because I'm happy here.

730
00:55:09.697 --> 00:55:12.483
Aren't you happy
too. baby?

731
00:55:23.058 --> 00:55:25.452
Golden Rock
is a magical place.

732
00:55:25.583 --> 00:55:27.933
Back then.
it was a secret place

733
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:31.502
where artists. intellectuals

734
00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:35.027
would come to get away
from the limelight.

735
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:38.900
having long conversations
with Arnie.

736
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:41.381
Well. that's nothing...

737
00:55:41.512 --> 00:55:43.644
nothing short of remarkable.

738
00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:47.605
Your father was a humanist.

739
00:55:48.606 --> 00:55:50.695
You would see him
with politicians

740
00:55:50.825 --> 00:55:53.393
you would not expect
to be together.

741
00:55:53.524 --> 00:55:55.439
arguing back and forth.

742
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:58.616
But what he really.
really loved...

743
00:55:59.747 --> 00:56:01.706
were artists.

744
00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:03.925
many of whom came here.

745
00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:05.187
Why do you...

746
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:08.974
think it is.
with all of the...

747
00:56:10.584 --> 00:56:12.543
the amazing people
from around the world

748
00:56:12.673 --> 00:56:14.980
that he met
and spoke to and...

749
00:56:17.025 --> 00:56:19.158
- that I never made that list?
- Hm.

750
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:25.164
I'm absolutely certain
he wanted you to be
on that list.

751
00:56:26.339 --> 00:56:28.428
It never got
a chance to happen.

752
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:32.606
Knowing now
what kind of a man he was.

753
00:56:32.737 --> 00:56:34.521
he must have had
a good reason

754
00:56:34.652 --> 00:56:37.959
not to contact my mother and me
for all those years. and--

755
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.918
and why would he leave

756
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:43.878
this home. his estate.
to an estranged son?

757
00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:45.314
There's got to be a reason.

758
00:56:45.445 --> 00:56:46.968
What I can tell you...

759
00:56:48.187 --> 00:56:51.930
is that when he met
your mom in the '60s.

760
00:56:53.148 --> 00:56:57.631
the very definition
of what he was
made him a target.

761
00:56:57.762 --> 00:56:59.154
A target?

762
00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:03.420
The FBI thought
your father was
a Communist.

763
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:07.119
Well. you do have to admit
that some of the writings
in his diaries

764
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:10.339
do have a strong tone of.
shall we say.

765
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:11.732
fringe thinking.

766
00:57:12.298 --> 00:57:14.605
Mm-hmm. Your mother
was torn

767
00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:18.391
between the depth of passion
she felt for him

768
00:57:18.522 --> 00:57:22.134
and her devotion
to your safety.

769
00:57:22.264 --> 00:57:25.006
I am absolutely convinced

770
00:57:25.137 --> 00:57:27.313
that that tension

771
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:31.448
was a big reason
why your father left.

772
00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:36.017
Ugh. I just. uh...

773
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:40.326
I can't wrap my head around
everything right now.

774
00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:42.023
- It's just--
- Dad?

775
00:57:42.154 --> 00:57:44.112
Mum's wondering where you are.
She needs help in the kitchen.

776
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:49.335
Well. good night.
Mr. Katzman.

777
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:50.684
Ben.

778
00:57:50.815 --> 00:57:52.599
- Good night. Ben Katzman.

779
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:54.558
That's close enough.

780
00:57:54.688 --> 00:57:56.516
- Night-night. Dad.
- Good night.

781
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.348
I guess I should go
and help my mum. too.

782
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:04.176
I thought it was
your night off?

783
00:58:04.306 --> 00:58:05.786
Yes. it is.

784
00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:08.180
But if you need me.
you can always call.

785
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:13.011
Would you like
to go for a walk?

786
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:15.404
- What? Now?
- Yeah.

787
00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:16.710
It's a beautiful night.

788
00:58:18.407 --> 00:58:20.322
What do you say?

789
00:58:20.453 --> 00:58:21.585
I say yes.

790
00:58:21.715 --> 00:58:23.500
I live on the beach
by the club.

791
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.936
You can walk me home.

792
00:58:36.991 --> 00:58:38.863
Do you think we'll be
single forever?

793
00:58:39.994 --> 00:58:42.867
- Oh. God. I hope so.
- What?

794
00:58:42.997 --> 00:58:45.304
Well. I love lying
like a starfish in the bed.

795
00:58:45.434 --> 00:58:49.830
And who wants to argue
over which way to hang
the toilet paper?

796
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:51.745
I think I do.

797
00:58:57.098 --> 00:58:58.535
Are you still in love
with George?

798
01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:09.083
Good morning. Sheldon.

799
01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.432
Good morning.
Mr. Katzman.

800
01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:11.956
Please. just call me Ben.

801
01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:15.655
- Good morning. Lois.
- Good morning. Ben.

802
01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:19.006
- How are you?
- Another lovely day
in paradise.

803
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.268
Yes. it is.

804
01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:22.880
Sheldon. I...

805
01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.447
I've read most
of my father's memoirs and...

806
01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:29.060
there's no mention
of my mother.

807
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.846
He writes all these wonderful
stories about Golden Rock

808
01:00:32.977 --> 01:00:35.719
and these amazing people.
but he doesn't mention anything

809
01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:39.244
about his time
in the United States
or my mother.

810
01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:41.986
Is there possibly
another journal
that I haven't seen?

811
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.118
I'm afraid I don't know.

812
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.080
Alrighty.

813
01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:57.218
Sheldon Rollins.
you're a bad man.

814
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:58.698
What did I do?

815
01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:02.093
I am a good Christian woman.
Don't you lie to me!

816
01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:05.749
I gave my word.

817
01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:19.632
I mean. I have really
caught the light here.

818
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.721
I mean. look
at the frame on this one.

819
01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:24.898
Hey. how you doing?

820
01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:27.771
- Claire. Sweetie.
- Huh?

821
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.643
This frame.
not that one. huh?

822
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.079
Yes. Focus.

823
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:34.125
- You know me.

824
01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:37.737
Wow. These are
actually really good.

825
01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.000
Somebody got
their mojo back.

826
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:44.178
Well. I mean.
I am extremely talented.

827
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:48.182
- Ben. Right.
-  Wonderful.

828
01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:49.357
- Guys...
- Hi.

829
01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.142
...now that we know
we can crush it.

830
01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:53.622
it's time to take the next step
and generate some more business.

831
01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:56.713
which means spending
some money. So. I did.

832
01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:59.672
I made us a website.
It's gonna be up
in three days.

833
01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.501
- Theo. I'll need
some pictures for it.
- You're damn right you will.

834
01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:05.330
We just need
some more clients.

835
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.376
I think one more wedding
and we might have
made ourselves

836
01:02:08.507 --> 01:02:10.857
some legitimate street credibility.

837
01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:12.424
Yes. I can see it now.

838
01:02:12.554 --> 01:02:14.382
"Breaking News: Woman Who's
Sworn Off Love Forever

839
01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:18.909
Suddenly Becomes Miss Wedding
Paradise Organizer
Extraordinaire!"

840
01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.780
- Amen to that. Cheers.

841
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:23.478
-  Cheers.
-  Cheers.

842
01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:24.915
Another perfect day.

843
01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:28.919
Oh. my gosh. This looks
so amazing. you guys!

844
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:33.271
And the asparagus is
so lush and so green. babe.

845
01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.099
I'm just gonna dip it
in the sauce a little bit.

846
01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:43.150
So good!

847
01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:46.023
So yummy!

848
01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:47.720
Mm. can you pass me
the chicken?

849
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:50.027
Sure. Knock yourself out.

850
01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:53.334
Oh.
it's is so tender.

851
01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:55.859
Mm. I'm just gonna dip it
in the sauce again.

852
01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:57.164
Oh. it's so good!

853
01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:59.297
Oh. my gosh.
And the salmon.

854
01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:00.602
Can I have some of the salmon?

855
01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:01.821
Oh. my gosh.

856
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:05.042
Is this papaya?

857
01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:10.482
Amazing.

858
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.181
Hello.
No. I can't hear you.

859
01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:16.401
Someone seems to be having
an orgasm over lunch.

860
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:19.273
No. no. I'm just... no.
I'm just kidding. Who is this?

861
01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:22.450
And the good news is
that there's plenty left
in the kitchen.

862
01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.583
Yeah. there's gonna
need to be.

863
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.241
Darling. that--
that must slow down.

864
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:33.070
Yes. it is papaya.
They do exist.

865
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:37.552
Georgie. Georgie.
Georgie. Georgie. good luck.

866
01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:44.559
So wonderful!

867
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.734
Baby. Baby. Baby.

868
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:46.997
- Mm-hmm?
- Is everything okay?

869
01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:48.955
Oh. it's way--
it's fabulous!

870
01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:52.393
You need to just
slow down just a little.

871
01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:53.786
Hey. guys.
that was Charlie.

872
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.788
I gotta go over
and sign some papers.

873
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.964
- Can I come? I'll drive.

874
01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.400
Well. sure. Come on.

875
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:04.710
Baby. I have to. um...
Ahem. uh. yeah.

876
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:05.842
Um...

877
01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:08.932
- Whatever.

878
01:04:11.282 --> 01:04:13.284
- Ashley. can I
ask you something?
- Sure.

879
01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.590
Harry says he does something
other than work at the club.

880
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:17.505
but it sounds really shady.

881
01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:19.507
and. you know. guys
who look like him
usually are.

882
01:04:19.638 --> 01:04:22.206
So. does he actually
have another job?

883
01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:25.862
Yes. he does.
And he is right behind you.

884
01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:27.211
So you can
ask him yourself.

885
01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:29.648
Okay. Good luck with that.

886
01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:31.955
Look like what?

887
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.393
- Hi. Claire.

888
01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.698
Hello.

889
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:39.701
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

890
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.885
Your cook is so fabulous.

891
01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:51.757
I mean. for him to put out
this spread so fast.

892
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.151
in all the colors
of the rainbow.

893
01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:56.153
I am--

894
01:04:56.283 --> 01:04:58.416
About to go viral.

895
01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:00.809
I love Nevis!

896
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.645
So. one week's vacation

897
01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:14.693
turned into you
walking away
from everything?

898
01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:17.217
Well. not really. I mean.
no one's given up
their homes.

899
01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:19.524
or sold their businesses
or anything.

900
01:05:19.654 --> 01:05:21.830
It's more like a sabbatical.

901
01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:23.876
if any of us were
smart enough to be professors.

902
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.013
How about you?
Did you leave
anything behind?

903
01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:33.059
Well. I haven't told
anyone yet.

904
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.932
but I handed
my notice in at work.

905
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.804
The wedding business
was my idea.

906
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:42.503
and I figured I ought to put
my lack of money
where my mouth is.

907
01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.505
We just need
a few more couples.

908
01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:46.943
So. you're really
going for it.

909
01:05:47.073 --> 01:05:49.075
A full year off.

910
01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:52.513
Yes. well. you know.
you only live once.

911
01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:54.776
Life's not a dress rehearsal.

912
01:05:54.907 --> 01:05:58.215
and live. laugh.
and love.

913
01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:03.655
Here we are.

914
01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:05.396
<i>Casa</i> Buchanan.

915
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.052
A boat. Heh.

916
01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:11.010
You live on a boat.

917
01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:25.546
-  Whoa!
This is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.

918
01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:30.377
Welcome to Sunshine.
my brothers.

919
01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:33.293
- You're the famous Sunshine.
- Yes. mon.

920
01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:34.512
- I'm George. Respect.
- Respect.

921
01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:35.774
We're here to meet Charlie.

922
01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:38.037
Charlie is over here
in the pink cabana.

923
01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:39.517
Sometimes we call it
a house of Judah.

924
01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:41.388
- Judah.

925
01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:42.955
Come along.

926
01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:47.177
Hello. Charlie.

927
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.274
Is something wrong?

928
01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:59.276
Nothing's wrong.

929
01:06:59.406 --> 01:07:01.626
Uh. your message was
a little cryptic.

930
01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.019
I was a little nervous.

931
01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:05.630
Sheldon called me.

932
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.503
He and I were your father's
oldest friends.

933
01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:13.464
which came with a certain
moral protection
of his memory.

934
01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:16.380
We had to be sure
the time was right...

935
01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:19.035
to give you this:

936
01:07:19.948 --> 01:07:24.301
Your father's memoirs
of his trip to America.

937
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:26.999
His love affair
with your mother.

938
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.174
their love letters.

939
01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:30.133
your birth.

940
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:34.267
His soul is in this book.

941
01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:37.314
Why did you wait until now?

942
01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:39.925
We had to be sure
you were ready for it.

943
01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:42.884
And furthermore.

944
01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:45.452
Sheldon informed me
Lois was gonna kick him
out of the house

945
01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:47.541
if I didn't give you this.

946
01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:52.981
All those famous people
you read about in the book.

947
01:07:54.853 --> 01:07:58.987
Arnie didn't court them.
It was the other way around.

948
01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:01.033
If he sought
after your mother...

949
01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:08.301
she must have been
a very. very special woman.

950
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:11.609
She was.

951
01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:14.655
One more thing.

952
01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:26.798
Your father
left a letter for you.

953
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.893
Ben. you're ready
to be a Sandoval.

954
01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:17.414
So what do you
actually do?

955
01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:19.329
You still think
I'm a beach bum.

956
01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:22.810
Well.
I didn't say that. per se.

957
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:24.682
but if the flip-flop fits...

958
01:09:25.248 --> 01:09:27.641
Ahem. I mean. obviously
it's something to do
with the ocean.

959
01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:30.253
So. you teach people to dive.

960
01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:32.168
or you take boatloads
of American tourists out

961
01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:34.257
to get drunk and puke
into the Atlantic.

962
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.740
I'm actually
a conservationist.

963
01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:43.396
I'm helping document
the biodiversity fluctuation

964
01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:46.356
around the lower
southeast Caribbean.

965
01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:48.923
I study fish.

966
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.883
- Wow.
- So...

967
01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:54.190
what's this long
story of yours?

968
01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:56.366
Oh...

969
01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.759
Are you worried
I'll judge you?

970
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.674
No. I'd be worried
if you didn't judge me.

971
01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:02.850
- Oh. come on.

972
01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:05.331
- You really don't want
to hear it.
- I really do.

973
01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:07.377
- I can assure you.
you really don't.
- I really do.

974
01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:09.727
- But I don't want to tell you.
- But I want you to tell me.

975
01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:11.859
Okay. It's just men.

976
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:13.905
Just lots and lots of men.

977
01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:19.127
Lots of stupid. weird.
obnoxious. self-centered.
horrible men

978
01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:23.088
who I've put my career
and life on hiatus for
several times.

979
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.569
So. whilst you've been
out here saving the fish.

980
01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:30.008
I've just been nursing
a hangover or heartbreak.

981
01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:31.923
It's pathetic.

982
01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:34.186
Hm.

983
01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:38.799
Could you. perhaps. clarify
your use of the word "lots"?

984
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.976
It's really
not that bad.

985
01:10:42.107 --> 01:10:43.935
It's just four--
five-- six.

986
01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:45.980
Oh. that's okay.

987
01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.155
This year.

988
01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:49.419
W-wow. Uh...

989
01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:53.945
So what do you think
<i>is</i> wrong with you?

990
01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:58.341
I think I just attract
the wrong kind of men.

991
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.997
Not sure what that
says about me.

992
01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:06.740
Um...

993
01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:09.352
Yes. well. I really
should be getting back.

994
01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:11.832
because I have
lots of work to do.

995
01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:15.096
And it's hard to make
a dramatic exit
off this. isn't it?

996
01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:17.360
It's okay. Claire.

997
01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:20.928
Listen. there's...

998
01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:23.148
something I really
wanna tell you.

999
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.454
Yes?

1000
01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:29.067
I think that... I found
your next customer

1001
01:11:29.197 --> 01:11:31.548
for your wedding business.

1002
01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:34.855
Oh. right!
Yes. of course.

1003
01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:37.249
- A guy I went
to Berkeley with.
- You went to Berkeley?

1004
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.948
Valedictorian.
I'm betting.

1005
01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:42.254
Anyway.
he just got engaged

1006
01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:44.561
and he's having issues
with the venue.

1007
01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:47.303
Oh. this is brilliant.
We're like the wedding vultures.

1008
01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.914
Call him now
whilst I'm here.

1009
01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:52.177
Geez. you're--
you're pushy.

1010
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.745
You haven't seen
anything yet.

1011
01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.877
Just don't make us out
to be too desperate.

1012
01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:58.139
Although we are.

1013
01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:05.843
Kent? Kent. hey.
Yeah. how are you?

1014
01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:10.587
Listen. Kent. I--
I just wanted to ask.

1015
01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.197
Did you sort
your wedding yet?

1016
01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:14.982
Uh-huh.

1017
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.290
I'm sorry to hear that.

1018
01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:23.251
But I think I've got
the solution. Hold on.

1019
01:12:24.775 --> 01:12:26.429
- Claire?

1020
01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:31.172
Hello. this is
Claire Chambers
of Paradise Weddings.

1021
01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:33.697
Corporate announcement!

1022
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:35.089
You can all
stop lounging around

1023
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.048
and acting like you're
on holiday or something.

1024
01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:38.266
We have another wedding!

1025
01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.486
-  Ooh.
- Ah-ha!

1026
01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.749
Harry has delivered us
the wedding of his friend.

1027
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.057
Kent Jones. of Boston.
Massachusetts. and Sydney.

1028
01:12:46.187 --> 01:12:50.017
the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Carter Whitley III.

1029
01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:52.063
also of Boston. Massachusetts.

1030
01:12:52.193 --> 01:12:55.066
- Blimey!
-  I've spoken to Kent

1031
01:12:55.196 --> 01:12:58.243
- and he's already wired us
the deposit.
- I love him already.

1032
01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:01.681
This one's a little bit
different. though.
Much more old school.

1033
01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:05.032
Kent's future-in-laws
are paying. so we need
to up our game.

1034
01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:07.252
- Mm.
- Okay. good.
So. when is it?

1035
01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.906
Three weeks.

1036
01:13:09.036 --> 01:13:10.995
What?
No pressure. then.

1037
01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:14.999
Well. I will go get us
some drinks.

1038
01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:17.828
Alrighty. Well. looks like
business is booming.

1039
01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:19.699
Where are you going?

1040
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.527
I'm gonna go find Ashley
and discuss some business strategy.

1041
01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:23.529
Oh. "business strategy."
Is that what you call it?

1042
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.836
Oh. that's funny. George.
But we're just friends.

1043
01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:27.838
Yeah. For now.

1044
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:33.757
So... you
and Prince Harry. huh?

1045
01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:35.367
Mm-hmm.

1046
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.151
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1047
01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:38.762
Oh. come on.

1048
01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.459
- It's purely professional.
-  Ugh!

1049
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.548
Professional.
my ass!

1050
01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:44.550
You do look good together.
I'll drink to that.

1051
01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:46.552
Cheers. sweetie.

1052
01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:48.685
- I'm over men.
- Oh.

1053
01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.883
Hello.

1054
01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:21.457
- You could hear me.

1055
01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.067
- You thought I wouldn't.

1056
01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.938
I thought you were
somewhere in Tibet
or something.

1057
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.900
What can I do for you.
Mr. Katzman?

1058
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.163
Ooh. so formal.
Kinda hurts.

1059
01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:34.513
I'm teasing you. Ben.

1060
01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.428
- What's up?
- Well. I just want
to let you know

1061
01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:39.344
that we got our next client.
A friend of Harry's.

1062
01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:42.695
His name is Kent something.
comes from Boston money.

1063
01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:44.828
Very wealthy family.
so it's really good for us.

1064
01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:47.265
And. yeah.
that's our next client.

1065
01:14:47.395 --> 01:14:51.138
And I also want to know
if maybe you wanted
to go out to dinner with me.

1066
01:14:51.269 --> 01:14:53.097
Tell me.
what is the connection

1067
01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.578
between you having booked
a new client and you
inviting me for dinner?

1068
01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:58.406
- Absolutely nothing.
- Thought as much.

1069
01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:00.670
But I have
what they call no game

1070
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.933
when it comes to inviting
a beautiful woman
out to dinner.

1071
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:05.631
But... just forget
I ever said anything.

1072
01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:09.287
I feel stupid now.
Sorry. I-I interrupted.

1073
01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.855
All right.
You have a date.

1074
01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:15.293
All right. Yes.

1075
01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.863
- So. shall we meditate?
-  Yes.

1076
01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:28.480
Thank you.

1077
01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:44.627
Yeah.

1078
01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.585
I can't believe
that you're a music producer.

1079
01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:49.196
Well. I tried to be.
That's why I left New York
and moved to London.

1080
01:15:49.327 --> 01:15:50.458
I wanted to be
a music producer.

1081
01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.199
Couple months
after I was there.

1082
01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:54.245
I was at a club
in Knightsbridge
called Ciro's Pomodoro

1083
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.551
and that's where
I met everyone.

1084
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:57.248
George and Alex.
they were performing.

1085
01:15:57.378 --> 01:15:58.989
and I thought they were
brilliant. and I thought.

1086
01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:01.513
"Hm. Let's see.
I think I can...

1087
01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.689
I think I can make
something of this
and promote them.

1088
01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.473
Put a show together."
And I did.

1089
01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.040
And guess what?

1090
01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.825
- It was a complete disaster.

1091
01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:11.305
I mean. disaster.
It was terrible.

1092
01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.569
But the beautiful thing
about it was. we became
great friends.

1093
01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:15.571
We've been friends
ever since.
15 years ago.

1094
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.007
Yeah. have you ever
been to London?

1095
01:16:17.137 --> 01:16:20.793
Haven't you noticed
my accent? I mean...

1096
01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:23.013
- You must think I'm stupid.

1097
01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:26.016
I have a degree
in environmental studies
from Oxford.

1098
01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:29.367
- Oxford? Ooh.
- Yes. Oxford.

1099
01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:31.195
You thought I never
left Nevis. Admit it.

1100
01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:34.590
No. I didn't. I...
Well. actually I did.

1101
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.896
- I know you did.

1102
01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:41.161
How come you left London
and went back to New York?

1103
01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.468
I got married.
Met a woman in London.

1104
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.818
and her big dream
was to live in New York City

1105
01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:49.300
and own an antique shop.
so I gave everything up.

1106
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:51.955
Ended up with a divorce
that I never wanted

1107
01:16:52.085 --> 01:16:54.827
and an antique shop
that I never wanted.

1108
01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:56.524
- Do you have children?
- No. no.

1109
01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:00.006
Haven't you noticed
the family tree.

1110
01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:03.140
that there's no name
after mine on that?

1111
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.621
Oh. my God.
You must think I'm so stupid.

1112
01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.753
No. No. I don't.
Not at all.

1113
01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:11.104
- Alex tells me
you're also a writer.
- Well...

1114
01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.803
I haven't written
anything in a long time.

1115
01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:18.938
You're different
from other guys I meet. Ben.

1116
01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:21.898
- I hope that's a good thing.
- Who knows?

1117
01:17:25.815 --> 01:17:27.643
Do you know why
I brought you here?

1118
01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:31.690
Because this place
is very special. It's...

1119
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:34.171
Right here.
in this spot.

1120
01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:36.216
today I was given
my father's journal

1121
01:17:36.347 --> 01:17:38.654
that has all of the letters.

1122
01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:40.960
the love letters
between my mother and father.

1123
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.666
Why do you keep
staring at me like that?

1124
01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.670
Because I think
you're beautiful.

1125
01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:57.498
Thank you.

1126
01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:01.633
Would you like some dessert?

1127
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:03.766
Always.

1128
01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:13.384
I really had
a good time tonight.

1129
01:18:13.514 --> 01:18:15.647
- Yes. so did I.
- Yeah.

1130
01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:17.127
Very much.

1131
01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:22.262
Well. I better get back.
A lot of inventory to do.

1132
01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:28.007
Aren't you going to kiss me?

1133
01:19:02.085 --> 01:19:03.739
Good night. Mr. Katzman.

1134
01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.567
Good night.

1135
01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:03.755
- Hello?
- Big day today.

1136
01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:07.150
Look at this beauty!
Caught this morning!

1137
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.282
I practically had
to fight for it.

1138
01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:11.284
- Beautiful.

1139
01:20:11.415 --> 01:20:13.896
Oh. and make sure they know
I got up early
to source this snapper.

1140
01:20:14.026 --> 01:20:17.160
because there's none
more fresher on the island.

1141
01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:20.728
I just don't understand
why you won't let the club
do the catering.

1142
01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:22.818
Ugh. Well. where's
the fun in that?

1143
01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:25.472
I love food.
I love cooking.

1144
01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:27.910
Okay. let's do it!

1145
01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:44.840
Dearly beloved.
welcome to paradise.

1146
01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:47.886
We are gathered here

1147
01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:53.413
to witness the marriage
of Kent and Sydney.

1148
01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:57.940
-  Cheers.

1149
01:21:01.073 --> 01:21:02.335
I love you. dear.

1150
01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:04.555
Thank you. Daddy.
I love you.

1151
01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:07.471
-  So great.
- You're stunning. just...

1152
01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:08.994
And you were right.
by the way.

1153
01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:11.692
Who needs a wedding
with 500 guests?

1154
01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:13.085
It didn't cost me
an arm and a leg.

1155
01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:14.957
Daddy!

1156
01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:17.524
- Is everyone having
a wonderful time?
-  Yes.

1157
01:21:19.222 --> 01:21:21.615
May I introduce Megan.
our executive chef?

1158
01:21:21.746 --> 01:21:22.921
Hi. Megan.

1159
01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:25.576
Hello. everyone.
How's the meal so far?

1160
01:21:25.706 --> 01:21:27.012
- Amazing.
- Wonderful.

1161
01:21:27.143 --> 01:21:28.405
Wonderful.

1162
01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:30.711
So. this is Caribbean-sourced
red snapper.

1163
01:21:30.842 --> 01:21:32.235
- Ooh.
- Caught this morning.

1164
01:21:32.365 --> 01:21:33.627
Fresh from the fisherman!

1165
01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:37.762
- Enjoy.
- Okay. Thank you.

1166
01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:41.897
A toast.

1167
01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:44.900
- Not yet. Let's try
this fish. shall we?
- Snapper first.

1168
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:49.905
-  Oh. gosh.
This is good.
- So smooth.

1169
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:52.733
-  Oh. it looks
so soft.
-  This looks yummy.

1170
01:21:57.216 --> 01:21:59.915
-  Cheers.

1171
01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:15.539
- Daddy!

1172
01:22:16.627 --> 01:22:18.237
- Mommy?

1173
01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:23.764
What are you--
what are you doing?

1174
01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:26.028
Why is she making
that face?

1175
01:22:26.158 --> 01:22:27.333
Come on. Daddy!

1176
01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.815
Mommy.
what are you doing?

1177
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.904
- Daddy!

1178
01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:34.123
What's wrong
with Daddy?

1179
01:22:39.432 --> 01:22:41.434
Do something.
Dad! Mommy!

1180
01:22:41.565 --> 01:22:43.175
Daddy!

1181
01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:45.873
Daddy!

1182
01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:49.355
Mommy!

1183
01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:54.491
- Do something!
- Honey!

1184
01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:03.195
Oh. my God!
We're gonna die.

1185
01:23:05.806 --> 01:23:09.723
- Mommy!
- I pooped.

1186
01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:12.683
Oh. My. Gosh.

1187
01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:14.815
Just a minute.

1188
01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:18.558
- Oh. my goodness!

1189
01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:21.170
-  Daddy!
- No.

1190
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.475
No!

1191
01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:28.307
How can you even look at me
and just say you're sorry?!

1192
01:23:28.438 --> 01:23:30.222
Do you even know
what you've done?

1193
01:23:30.353 --> 01:23:34.313
You ruined
the most important day
of my life!

1194
01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:36.837
Do you even understand
the stress that I've
gone through.

1195
01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:39.492
what we have done to be here.
just to get here?

1196
01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:43.540
I spent so much time
picking out a dress for here!

1197
01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.021
I don't have a video.
I don't have photos.
I have nothing!

1198
01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:48.719
I will be destroyed!

1199
01:23:48.849 --> 01:23:50.938
And it's all because of you!

1200
01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:53.332
Do you even understand
what you just did?

1201
01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:56.379
I'm going to make sure
my daddy sues you
for every penny you have.

1202
01:23:56.509 --> 01:23:58.033
He will take you down.

1203
01:23:58.163 --> 01:23:59.382
You're incompetent.

1204
01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:02.167
"Paradise Weddings"?
Ha! My ass!

1205
01:24:02.298 --> 01:24:05.040
I should have never
trusted a blonde. Never!

1206
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.607
You poisoned my family.

1207
01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:09.827
Did you see
what I had to see?

1208
01:24:09.957 --> 01:24:14.788
You made my daddy
poop himself
in a $4.000 suit!

1209
01:24:14.919 --> 01:24:16.181
And it's not going
to be forgotten.

1210
01:24:16.312 --> 01:24:18.009
I will not stand for this!

1211
01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.664
Are you--
are you even married?

1212
01:24:20.794 --> 01:24:24.146
You're not even married?

1213
01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:26.496
She's not married!

1214
01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:33.068
Kent! Get your ass
in here!

1215
01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:49.562
So. how are
the happy couple?

1216
01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:51.608
- Filed for divorce yet?
- It's not funny. Theo.

1217
01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:53.392
That is rich
coming from you. Claire.

1218
01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:55.786
considering you basically
bullied us into this venture.

1219
01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:57.875
The least thing you could have
is a sense of humor about it.

1220
01:24:58.005 --> 01:25:00.834
I didn't bully your stupid wife
into thinking she was
Gordon Ramsey

1221
01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:02.619
when all she knows
about food is from YouTube!

1222
01:25:02.749 --> 01:25:04.142
Don't talk
to my wife like that!

1223
01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:06.884
- Don't just blame Megan!
- No. it was the fish.

1224
01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:08.668
We should've used
the catering company.

1225
01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:11.280
Shut up. Alex!
And stop being a bitch
for once in your life.

1226
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:13.499
- No. she's right.
okay? She's right.

1227
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.762
It's my fault.
I should have known better.

1228
01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:18.287
But if one more person says
I should have used
the catering company.

1229
01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:20.637
I'm gonna throw myself
into the nearest volcano!

1230
01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.247
Please. be my guest.

1231
01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:23.683
Look. baby.
It's not your fault.

1232
01:25:23.814 --> 01:25:25.207
Oh.
cut the crap. George.

1233
01:25:25.337 --> 01:25:27.905
"It's not your fault. baby."
Whose fault is it. huh?

1234
01:25:28.035 --> 01:25:29.907
You guys remember
the first wedding?

1235
01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:32.562
It was perfect.
It was freaking perfect.

1236
01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:34.520
Rubbish! Utter crap!

1237
01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:37.567
It was a fluke!
We got through
by the skin of our teeth.

1238
01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:40.047
He's right. We have
no idea what we're doing.

1239
01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:42.006
- That's not true!
- Someone could have died!

1240
01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.269
I mean. by the way.
are we insured?

1241
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.880
Nobody did die. And. no.
I didn't take insurance.

1242
01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:49.361
- Did you?
- It's your bloody company!

1243
01:25:49.492 --> 01:25:52.408
- That's why we're here.
- Please just stop it!

1244
01:25:52.538 --> 01:25:55.585
Can everyone relax?
It is everybody's fault.

1245
01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.717
Yeah. but mostly Megan's.

1246
01:25:57.848 --> 01:26:01.199
I'm the one that ruined
everything. I know
that I ruined everything!

1247
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.202
Baby. Harry just said
it's all of us.
It's all our faults.

1248
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:05.769
Yeah. but he
doesn't mean it.

1249
01:26:05.899 --> 01:26:07.858
None of you guys mean it.

1250
01:26:07.988 --> 01:26:10.948
You guys all laugh
at me behind my back.
You think I'm an idiot.

1251
01:26:11.078 --> 01:26:14.212
You guys are all just a bunch
of self-obsessed losers.

1252
01:26:14.343 --> 01:26:18.173
with your stupid hats
and your boring old stories
about the old days.

1253
01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:22.655
- Look. Megan. it's okay--
- No! No! Stop
apologizing for me!

1254
01:26:22.786 --> 01:26:26.311
I wanna go home.
I don't like it
in here anymore. okay?

1255
01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:30.141
I messed up. I'm sorry.
I just wanna go home.

1256
01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:33.579
I am sorry I messed up!
Okay? I'm sorry!

1257
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:36.191
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1258
01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:42.501
Thanks a lot. guys. Thanks.

1259
01:27:51.701 --> 01:27:53.268
For goodness' sake.

1260
01:27:54.573 --> 01:27:56.401
What's wrong
with you people?

1261
01:27:58.142 --> 01:27:59.535
Are you just
gonna give it up?

1262
01:28:01.188 --> 01:28:02.581
Are you gonna
throw it all away

1263
01:28:02.712 --> 01:28:04.714
and scuttle back
to your everyday lives

1264
01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:06.193
as if nothing happened?

1265
01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:10.372
You haven't given
the island a chance.

1266
01:28:10.502 --> 01:28:14.419
You arrived and you fell
into the whole holiday
beach vibe mentality.

1267
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:17.770
and all you could think about
was having fun and creating
a business.

1268
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:22.122
You couldn't just sit
and let the island
speak for herself.

1269
01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:26.605
Right. come on.

1270
01:28:27.389 --> 01:28:28.868
I'm taking you on a hike.

1271
01:28:49.498 --> 01:28:51.761
<i>This is
the beating heart of Nevis.</i>

1272
01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:57.462
<i>This is what grounds me...</i>

1273
01:28:59.595 --> 01:29:01.466
<i>what feeds my soul.</i>

1274
01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:08.343
<i>What calls me back every time
I leave the island.</i>

1275
01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:15.262
<i>I need this like I need
the air that I breathe.</i>

1276
01:29:17.395 --> 01:29:19.571
<i>This is where I found
how to live.</i>

1277
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:23.793
It's where I found myself.

1278
01:29:26.056 --> 01:29:29.494
This place gives me the rhythm
by which I live my life.

1279
01:29:30.887 --> 01:29:32.671
<i>And it's a part of me.</i>

1280
01:29:37.197 --> 01:29:39.112
<i>But only because I let it in.</i>

1281
01:30:39.564 --> 01:30:41.305
<i>"My dear son...</i>

1282
01:30:43.307 --> 01:30:46.876
<i>I've lived a full life
with only one regret:</i>

1283
01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.010
<i>leaving you.</i>

1284
01:30:51.141 --> 01:30:53.970
<i>I held you in my arms
when you were born.</i>

1285
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:57.495
<i>but I had to leave
all too soon.</i>

1286
01:30:59.279 --> 01:31:01.543
<i>I've been thinking
about that day</i>

1287
01:31:01.673 --> 01:31:04.110
<i>every moment of my life.</i>

1288
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:08.854
<i>Your baby smile...</i>

1289
01:31:08.985 --> 01:31:12.989
<i>I don't want you to hold
any bad feelings
towards your mother.</i>

1290
01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:16.296
<i>We were very much in love.</i>

1291
01:31:16.427 --> 01:31:20.170
<i>But she was terrified
that I would be arrested.</i>

1292
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.477
<i>So I left.</i>

1293
01:31:22.607 --> 01:31:25.784
<i>We decided that it was
better this way.</i>

1294
01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:28.657
<i>I respected her wishes
to go away.</i>

1295
01:31:30.746 --> 01:31:32.574
<i>But now that I am gone.</i>

1296
01:31:33.966 --> 01:31:37.230
<i>I want you to know
who you are.</i>

1297
01:31:37.361 --> 01:31:41.234
<i>You are my son. my blood.</i>

1298
01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:45.848
<i>The roots of your family
are on this island.</i>

1299
01:31:45.978 --> 01:31:49.242
<i>Our history
is in your blood.</i>

1300
01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:51.506
<i>so I leave this house
to you...</i>

1301
01:31:52.942 --> 01:31:56.293
<i>because it's the history
of our family.</i>

1302
01:31:56.423 --> 01:31:59.035
<i>I hope your life here
will be full of joy.</i>

1303
01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:03.996
<i>Love this island. my son.</i>

1304
01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:06.825
<i>She will give you
more than you can imagine.</i>

1305
01:32:08.435 --> 01:32:10.263
<i>I love you.</i>

1306
01:32:10.394 --> 01:32:14.398
<i>Your father. Arnie Sandoval."</i>

1307
01:34:38.194 --> 01:34:41.545
-  <i>Mazel tov!</i>
