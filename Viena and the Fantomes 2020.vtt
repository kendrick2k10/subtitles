1
00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.783
Okay. so do you feel
that your band

2
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.852
formed part of what some people
call the...

3
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:55.855
Your band? Excuse me?

4
00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:57.490
- The band.
- The band.

5
00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:58.858
Sorry.

6
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.195
Paul. my question is for you.

7
00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:04.330
Do you feel that the band.
The Fantomes.

8
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:07.533
formed part of what some people
call the Post Punk movement

9
00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.238
or did you guys
just come out of nowhere?

10
00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:13.274
Paul?

11
00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.776
Well. what about you?

12
00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:20.713
- I don't have an opinion.
- Really?

13
00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.216
So you don't have an opinion
about the allegations

14
00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:26.888
of girls who've said that
you've attacked them?

15
00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.558
That's just noise.

16
00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:34.760
- Just noise?
- Just noise.

17
00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:36.831
Then there's no truth
in that noise?

18
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.267
Ah. gosh!!

19
00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.569
Because there've been some very
serious allegations!!

20
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.573
Okay. that's it.

21
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.383
Can I ask you a quick question?

22
00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.751
Yeah.

23
00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:00.486
So. why did you decide
to go on the road?

24
00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:02.255
Oh. no. I'm not.
I'm not with the group.

25
00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:03.789
No. I know. I know. I know.
I know. but I just wanted

26
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.925
to know a little bit about you
and your world

27
00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:08.630
and your passions and interests.

28
00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.673
Why do I have to go anywhere?

29
00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.031
Wow. you made this?

30
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Ah. shit.
some girl gave that to me

31
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.935
to give to them
and then they canceled the show.

32
00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:51.804
She's gonna kill me.
I... I don't know how many hours

33
00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:53.675
she spent on that thing.

34
00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:58.678
You know. I know somebody
that tours with them.

35
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.414
I can give it to 'em.

36
00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:04.083
With The Fantomes?

37
00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:08.087
I don't know.
I mean. it might be valuable.

38
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.656
I... I was thinking
of just framing it.

39
00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:12.460
Waiting.

40
00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:16.090
How long have you been here?

41
00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:20.128
Okay. stay here.
Okay. okay.

42
00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:52.860
Who are you?

43
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.563
Viena.

44
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.800
That's not your real name
though.

45
00:06:01.602 --> 00:06:03.471
She know the rules?

46
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.009
What's this?

47
00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:10.776
Just a drawing

48
00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.979
- Fuck! Did you do this?
- Yeah.

49
00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:15.948
Back in he day.

50
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.085
'Cause you're special. right?

51
00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:23.758
You guys just keep multiplying.

52
00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.896
Did you do this? What is this?

53
00:06:50.818 --> 00:06:53.719
So this goes to Freddy
and those go to Albert.

54
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.254

Madge. And Madge
is the boss around here.

56
00:06:57.992 --> 00:06:59.925
So don't fuck with her.

00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:15.274
Hey. help me out
with this.

62
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:37.997
You have to return those.

63
00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.901
Boyer and his friends
are staying on the trucks.

64
00:07:41.903 --> 00:07:43.936
Madge. can you come and check
this out?

65
00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:46.641
- Yeah one second. baby.
- Now!

66
00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:03.289
Almost no one got a room.

67
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.958
So the leeches are gonna be
with us tonight. probably.

68
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.061
- Who're the leeches?
- Hey. hey. you. Right there!

69
00:08:09.063 --> 00:08:13.132
Put that bag back inside.
right now. Who are you?

70
00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:14.733
They told me to bring it down.
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:16.804
Yeah?
Who the fuck told you that?

72
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.942
How do you do it?

73
00:08:56.944 --> 00:08:59.046
How do you survive this place?

74
00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:02.748
Uh... it's easy.

75
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.284
You just... just pretend
to be busy.

76
00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:08.723
try not to say no.
stay out of everyone's way.

77
00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:13.626
There's always a dog
that everybody walks all over.

78
00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:15.794
Don't be that.

79
00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.932
And don't clean toilets.

80
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.141
Light here.

81
00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:06.812

00:10:10.084 --> 00:10:11.952
No. wait. wait. wait.

83
00:10:20.294 --> 00:10:22.728
- You're fuckin' it up now.
- Don't...

84
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.831
- Please. don't do that.
- Oh. my God. calm down.

85
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.200
She's definitely not
a cover though.

86
00:10:28.202 --> 00:10:30.703
- You tried.
- Yo. what's your name?

87
00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:33.172

88
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.973
What's the point now?

89
00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:39.044
- Oh. my God. please stop.
- You'll make another one.

90
00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:40.915
I mean. it's all fucked up.

91
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.152
Oh. don't be so dramatic.
it's not fucking tragedy.

92
00:10:47.154 --> 00:10:49.757
- Susi.
- Hey. that was good.

93
00:10:57.798 --> 00:10:59.231
Hey. don't take it like that.

94
00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:02.970
She's. uh. she's just like that
sometimes.

95
00:11:08.409 --> 00:11:09.944
Viena...

96
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.982

Okay.

- Not your kinda fun.

You were so rude to me

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.476
No. I'm not gonna drink
from your shitty little flask.

133
00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:35.580
Okay. alright.

134
00:14:35.582 --> 00:14:37.282
Alright. so why don't we like

00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:40.252

137
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.586

141
00:14:47.294 --> 00:14:49.695

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.603
Get out!

145
00:14:59.073 --> 00:15:01.442

00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:15.153
- It's her tape!
- Oh. my God!

148
00:15:15.155 --> 00:15:16.688
What is it?

149
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.223
This crazy bitch
that almost put

150
00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:19.591
Freddy and Albert in jail.

151
00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:21.426
She's like 16
and they were drunk

152
00:15:21.428 --> 00:15:24.429
and she said that they tried
to drown her in a Jacuzzi.

153
00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:26.698
Then there were like cops
hanging around for a while

154
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:32.070
and then one day randomly
she just dropped the charges.

155
00:15:32.072 --> 00:15:34.606
Freddy.
I made this tape for you.

156
00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:37.309
You found me. insult me
with your purity

157
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:41.513
and now I realize you never
wanted to kill me.

158
00:15:41.515 --> 00:15:43.215
You wanted to save me.

159
00:15:43.217 --> 00:15:47.285
So tonight. I'm going to finish
what you started...

160
00:15:47.287 --> 00:15:49.721
to this song.

161
00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:51.590
My favorite song.

162
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.195
Hi.

163
00:17:08.469 --> 00:17:10.135
Yo. where's the kid?

Come on. come on. we need you.

165
00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:13.371
- What for?
- Boyer picked a fight.

166
00:17:13.373 --> 00:17:15.540
We gotta go get his back.

00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.644
Come on. go!

168
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:37.729
Boyer. you fucking retard?
How did you let this happen?

169
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:40.465
This ain't my fault. okay?
He wanted to fight!

170
00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:43.535
Hey. you!
You fuckin' wanna fight?

171
00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:45.370
Answer me.
You wanted to fight?

172
00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:47.139
It's not his fault.

173
00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:58.152
Hey. Keyes. you alright?

174
00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:04.892
Honestly. I don't know what
the fuss is about. I spit blood.

175
00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:15.267
Mother fucker.
did I tell you to do that?

176
00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:17.602
Did I tell you to do that?
Don't fuck with me right now.

177
00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.738
Did I tell you to fuckin'
do that?

178
00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:34.953
Are you okay?
Thank you.

179
00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:36.555
Okay. he said he didn't tell him
to fight.

180
00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.190
- So. let's just...
- Hey. did I say shit?

181
00:18:38.192 --> 00:18:39.591
- Did I say anything?
- Come on. come on.

182
00:18:39.593 --> 00:18:40.725
- Did I say anything?
- Come on.

183
00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:41.826
Please leave.

184
00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:43.530
This is not what we do.

185
00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:51.570
You see...

186
00:18:51.572 --> 00:18:53.538
it's just a little...

187
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.409
Looks good.

188
00:18:58.445 --> 00:19:00.714
- Who told you though?
- Okay. let's go out.

189
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.851
Ice it. disinfect the wound.

190
00:19:06.853 --> 00:19:09.323
Then I'm buying both of you
a drink.

191
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.763
Well. at least
I got us invited.

192
00:19:17.598 --> 00:19:19.466
Shut the fuck up!

193
00:19:21.501 --> 00:19:23.301
We'll go in the back.

194
00:19:23.303 --> 00:19:25.606
About fuckin' time.

195
00:19:26.773 --> 00:19:28.642
Come on. hurry up.

196
00:19:29.243 --> 00:19:30.644
Goddamn!

197
00:20:37.978 --> 00:20:40.045
How much money
did we spend tonight?

198
00:20:40.047 --> 00:20:41.748
Let go. Al.

199
00:21:16.016 --> 00:21:17.782
What... what if
they come outside.

200
00:21:17.784 --> 00:21:19.653
There's nobody here.

201
00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:23.757
Hey!

202
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.735
- No! No! No!
- No?

203
00:21:36.737 --> 00:21:39.003
- No. no. no.
- No. no. no.

204
00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:10.635
Hey!

205
00:22:10.637 --> 00:22:13.772
Get the fuck out of my pool!

206
00:22:13.774 --> 00:22:15.776
I'm callin' the police.

207
00:23:15.836 --> 00:23:18.038
Albert's gonna do it.

208
00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:21.840
I'm not doing it.

209
00:23:21.842 --> 00:23:24.611
They came all the way
from Norway. just a minute.

210
00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:27.005
Can I get some privacy in here?

211
00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:29.807
I have to go.

212
00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:33.545
Go away. Viena.
You're ruining my shower.

213
00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:35.680
I can't have a moments peace.

214
00:24:35.682 --> 00:24:37.215
- Go away.
- Stop!

215
00:24:37.217 --> 00:24:39.050
- Get out!
- What?

216
00:24:39.052 --> 00:24:41.152
- Now. you're gonna get wet.
- Stop it.

217
00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:43.588
- Please go. Viena.
- No!

218
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.326
- No! Stop it!
- Go away!

219
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.239
Viena.

220
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:08.246
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:25:08.248 --> 00:25:10.114
What're you doin'?

222
00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:12.350
Just doin' some numbers
for Madge.

223
00:25:12.352 --> 00:25:15.119
Oh. yeah?

224
00:25:15.121 --> 00:25:18.358
At what point are you gonna
clean the grill?

225
00:25:20.226 --> 00:25:21.960
I said I would get someone
to clean the grill

226
00:25:21.962 --> 00:25:24.598
I'm not doing it right now.
I'm busy with this.

227
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.301
Everyone has to do more
than one job. you know.

228
00:25:30.303 --> 00:25:32.337
- Yeah.
- Yeah. what?

229
00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:34.038
Yeah. I know.

230
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.776
I do more than a hundred jobs.
Susi.

231
00:25:41.881 --> 00:25:44.115
Okay. you know what.
when you finish

232
00:25:44.117 --> 00:25:47.018
I need you to clean this mess
and that bathroom.

233
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.355
Sorry?

234
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.825
I'm telling you that when you're
done with your job

235
00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:55.929
to clean the bathroom.

236
00:25:57.263 --> 00:25:59.163
- I can't do that.
- Really?

237
00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:00.198
It's not gonna happen.

238
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.100
So you're basically telling me

239
00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:03.334
to go fuck myself?

240
00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:05.169
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying

241
00:26:05.171 --> 00:26:06.938
I'm not gonna clean
the bathroom. It's not my job.

242
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.342
Your job is to do
what you're told.

243
00:26:28.395 --> 00:26:31.197
Alright. it's done.
Get out. you're fired.

244
00:26:32.032 --> 00:26:33.366
Get out!

245
00:26:37.437 --> 00:26:40.140
I'm serious I just talked to the
boys. You have an hour to leave.

246
00:26:41.408 --> 00:26:43.910
You want to be a fuckin' badass.
right?

247
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:58.956
Hey! What're you doing?

248
00:26:58.958 --> 00:27:02.126
- She fired me.
- Wha... Who? Susi?

249
00:27:02.128 --> 00:27:03.428
Wait. wait.
no. no. no. no. no.

250
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.929
She doesn't have the power
to fire you.

251
00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:06.764
We should go talk
to the boys about this.

252
00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:07.832
Will you talk to me. please?
Where the fuck are you...

253
00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:09.200
Hey. listen. can you just clean

254
00:27:09.202 --> 00:27:10.968
the fucking bathroom?

255
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.839
Viena. wait. you can't just not
talk to me about this.

256
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.941
V. where the fuck
are you gonna go?

257
00:27:16.943 --> 00:27:20.078
- Hey. where you goin'?
- Away.

258
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.280
- Why?
- I'm fired.

259
00:27:22.282 --> 00:27:25.116
- How?
- It was me.

260
00:27:25.118 --> 00:27:27.852
She has to go. all she wants
to do is have fun and not work

261
00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.487
and we can't afford
to have people like that.

262
00:27:29.489 --> 00:27:30.922
It's bullshit!

263
00:27:30.924 --> 00:27:33.091
A lot of people here
want you out.

264
00:27:33.093 --> 00:27:36.260
Okay? We work. we work hard.
That's what we do.

265
00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:38.296
Okay.

266
00:27:38.298 --> 00:27:40.300
Hey. Viena. stop.

267
00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.767
Just stop.

268
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:44.437
Can I talk to you?

269
00:27:47.107 --> 00:27:49.075
You wanna drop the bag?

270
00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:55.079
Keyes. just take the bags back
to the room?

271
00:27:55.081 --> 00:27:56.816
Don't you fucking dare!

272
00:28:02.489 --> 00:28:04.357
Susi.

273
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.107
God-fucking-dammit.
Freddy!

274
00:28:23.109 --> 00:28:24.475
- Is this what you want?
- Oh!

275
00:28:24.477 --> 00:28:26.310
The toasters going
to the highway.

276
00:28:26.312 --> 00:28:28.813
You fucker. Freddy!

277
00:28:28.815 --> 00:28:32.283
- This is the end.
- Is this what you want?

278
00:28:32.285 --> 00:28:34.318
I just don't know what's fucking
keeping me here.

279
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.954
I really know you're pushing me
out the fucking door!

280
00:28:36.956 --> 00:28:39.959
Do you want me to leave?
Is this what you want?

281
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:44.462
I've done everything
you've ever asked me to do!

282
00:28:44.464 --> 00:28:48.166
What haven't I done for you?
God damn it. Freddy!

283
00:28:49.869 --> 00:28:51.469
Is...

284
00:28:51.471 --> 00:28:54.941
- Is he coming over here?
- Oh. fuck. Shit.

285
00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:01.381
Hey.

286
00:29:03.183 --> 00:29:06.352
Now. you better lock your doors.
tonight the devil is out.

287
00:29:08.555 --> 00:29:10.089
You got any beer?

288
00:29:11.591 --> 00:29:13.126
Yeah.

289
00:29:21.067 --> 00:29:22.836
Thanks.

290
00:30:50.556 --> 00:30:52.590
Why am I not pissed off?

291
00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:55.395
- When am I not pissed?
- Mm-hm.

292
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:01.299
Hey. come on. not here.

293
00:31:01.301 --> 00:31:02.566
You got all these places
to ride.

294
00:31:02.568 --> 00:31:04.535
can you ride somewhere else.
please?

295
00:31:04.537 --> 00:31:06.306
God damn!

296
00:31:26.993 --> 00:31:29.260
She's here.
she's just standing there...

297
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:31.564
Fuck it. I said
I don't wanna do it. Madge.

298
00:31:34.367 --> 00:31:37.170
- Um. do you want one of these?
- Not now. Viena.

299
00:31:39.505 --> 00:31:42.506
- What do you have?
- Turkey sandwiches.

300
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:51.217
Are you okay?

301
00:31:52.552 --> 00:31:55.621
No. I'm not. I feel terrible.

302
00:32:00.426 --> 00:32:02.526
I'm sorry.

303
00:32:02.528 --> 00:32:04.528
It's okay. alright?

304
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.367
It's not your fault.
It's not all about you.

305
00:32:29.255 --> 00:32:32.656
Are you kidding me?
That's pretty good.

306
00:32:32.658 --> 00:32:35.526
- Alright.
- Hey.

307
00:32:35.528 --> 00:32:39.230
You guys. um... doing
well?

308
00:32:39.232 --> 00:32:42.700
- Good day?
- Yep.

309
00:32:42.702 --> 00:32:47.171
Can. uh. can you leave
us alone for a second please?

310
00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:49.540
- Two minutes.
- Sure.

311
00:32:49.542 --> 00:32:51.644
Thank you.

312
00:33:05.124 --> 00:33:07.126
Do you know what you're doing?

313
00:33:08.261 --> 00:33:09.493
What?

314
00:33:09.495 --> 00:33:12.131
You want him. Right?

315
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:15.499
What?

316
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:18.202
You want him.

317
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:20.571
There's nothing wrong with him.

318
00:33:20.573 --> 00:33:24.141
But that what's happening.

319
00:33:24.143 --> 00:33:28.179
I... I don't think you should
get mixed with him.

320
00:33:28.181 --> 00:33:31.315
I... I don't want you to get
mixed up with Freddy.

321
00:33:31.317 --> 00:33:34.218
I know you think it's a good
idea. but it's not.

322
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.091
I mean. I don't think you can
help him or us.

323
00:33:39.425 --> 00:33:41.425
Do you understand?

324
00:35:10.917 --> 00:35:14.618
Oh. fuck. Hey. move away
from the amp.

325
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.522
Over there.

326
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:11.976
Freddy!

327
00:36:11.978 --> 00:36:13.946
He's in the bathroom.

328
00:36:25.424 --> 00:36:28.459
Hell no. No. no. no. no. no.
Get out.

329
00:36:28.461 --> 00:36:30.027
- I'm not doing anything.
- Get out.

330
00:36:30.029 --> 00:36:31.862
I'm not doing anything.
It's you.

331
00:36:31.864 --> 00:36:33.964
- Go on. go. go. go.
- It's you.

332
00:36:33.966 --> 00:36:35.534
It's all you...

333
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.753
So why. Viena?

334
00:36:55.354 --> 00:36:57.456
Some of my friends
call me Viena.

335
00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:02.061
But it's not my name.
My name is Julia.

336
00:37:04.563 --> 00:37:06.430
You know we are almost broke.
right. Julia?

337
00:37:06.432 --> 00:37:09.669
Don't call me that... please.

338
00:37:12.038 --> 00:37:14.940
But. yeah. I heard some Monroe
guy has all your money.

339
00:37:17.343 --> 00:37:19.777
You know the money people say.
you can't play

340
00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:23.349
without any money.
but who needs money to play?

341
00:38:05.858 --> 00:38:08.392
I'm sorry.

342
00:38:08.394 --> 00:38:10.062
I know.

343
00:38:25.378 --> 00:38:27.646
Ah. we're gonna
fuck up that kid.

344
00:39:47.793 --> 00:39:49.128
Paul?

345
00:39:50.963 --> 00:39:53.664
Well. what about you?

346
00:39:53.666 --> 00:39:56.099
I don't have an opinion.

347
00:39:56.101 --> 00:39:57.835
Really?

348
00:39:57.837 --> 00:40:00.037
You don't have opinion
about the allegations

349
00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:03.843
of girls who've said
that you've attacked them.

350
00:40:59.565 --> 00:41:00.599
What is that?

351
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.773
- You've got to end it with him.
- What?

352
00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:11.808
You've got to end it with him.

353
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.012
Who?

354
00:41:14.713 --> 00:41:15.915
Your guy.

355
00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:22.252
What guy? Keyes?

356
00:41:22.254 --> 00:41:25.055
Yeah. that guy.

357
00:41:25.057 --> 00:41:27.090
He's not my guy.

358
00:41:27.092 --> 00:41:30.861
I mean I like him.
but he's not my guy.

359
00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:32.865
Well. I think
you gotta stop that.

360
00:41:36.302 --> 00:41:38.671
I don't even really talk to him.

361
00:41:42.608 --> 00:41:43.642
You see...

362
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:47.179
if we do this...

363
00:41:48.113 --> 00:41:49.315
we should do it.

364
00:41:50.316 --> 00:41:51.717
Okay?

365
00:41:53.152 --> 00:41:54.620
The right way.

366
00:41:57.756 --> 00:41:58.958
End it. please.

367
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.928
You're serious?

368
00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:07.066
Okay.

369
00:42:16.709 --> 00:42:18.976
Hey. Can I talk to Keyes
for two seconds?

370
00:42:18.978 --> 00:42:21.912
Why? I mean it's about to be
my turn it just...

371
00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:24.948
- I mean you can just say it.
- Just two seconds.

372
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.620
- Okay. fine. Can you pause it?
- There's no pause. man.

373
00:42:28.654 --> 00:42:30.956
Sorry. no pause. Gotta wait.

374
00:42:32.124 --> 00:42:34.091
Come on.

375
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:37.363
Viena just turned your victory
to shit. so none of this counts.

376
00:42:42.635 --> 00:42:45.369
I'm about to beat myself...

377
00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:47.239
and my own record.

378
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:53.846
Um...

379
00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.420
I just wanted to say that
I'm. I'm with Freddy now.

380
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.792
Okay.

381
00:43:40.392 --> 00:43:41.427
It's done.

382
00:43:43.162 --> 00:43:44.196
And?

383
00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:46.865
And what?

384
00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:48.801
Well. what did he say?

385
00:43:51.837 --> 00:43:53.937
He didn't say anything.

386
00:43:53.939 --> 00:43:55.441
He said it was okay.

387
00:43:57.376 --> 00:43:58.410
What?

388
00:44:00.212 --> 00:44:02.481
That's what he said.
He said. "Okay."

389
00:44:03.749 --> 00:44:05.050
Just like that?

390
00:44:08.887 --> 00:44:09.922
Fuck.

391
00:44:12.324 --> 00:44:16.326
That... that's fucking worse than
weird and...

392
00:44:16.328 --> 00:44:19.331
- Why is that weird?
- Can you just go. please?

393
00:44:22.134 --> 00:44:24.801
You know. just to me
"Okay" is bullshit.

394
00:44:24.803 --> 00:44:27.237
Like suppose. you know. this was
me and there was this guy

395
00:44:27.239 --> 00:44:28.739
and he just says. he says

396
00:44:28.741 --> 00:44:29.973
there's this girl
you like man. right.

397
00:44:29.975 --> 00:44:31.508
This... this fucking skank.

398
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.143
She getting passed around.

399
00:44:33.145 --> 00:44:35.414
You know. I can only take that
one fucking way!

400
00:44:52.865 --> 00:44:54.199
Hey. Keyes. man.

401
00:45:00.005 --> 00:45:01.840
Yo. can you open
the equipment box?

402
00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:38.443
In the back.

403
00:45:55.427 --> 00:45:56.927
That's it?

404
00:45:56.929 --> 00:45:59.131
Uh. yeah.

405
00:46:02.067 --> 00:46:03.202
Alright.

406
00:46:27.226 --> 00:46:29.092
Do you want this anywhere?

407
00:46:29.094 --> 00:46:30.262
Anywhere is fine.

408
00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:38.869
- This one?
- Anywhere.

409
00:46:38.871 --> 00:46:40.205
- Here?
- Sure.

410
00:46:45.644 --> 00:46:47.045
How are you?

411
00:46:52.484 --> 00:46:54.019
Don't patronize me.

412
00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.389
Okay.

413
00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:04.229
How are you?

414
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.265
Fine.

415
00:47:11.503 --> 00:47:13.236
How's the sex?

416
00:47:13.238 --> 00:47:15.005
What?

417
00:47:15.007 --> 00:47:16.308
How's the sex?

418
00:47:24.082 --> 00:47:27.150
Viena.
how's the sex?

419
00:47:27.152 --> 00:47:29.655
- It's good.
- It sounded good.

420
00:47:52.477 --> 00:47:54.044
No. man.
I'm telling you.

421
00:47:54.046 --> 00:47:55.478
We need to ditch Monroe.
That is... That's it.

422
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.513
He's a fucking thief.

423
00:47:56.515 --> 00:47:57.681
But. Freddy...

424
00:47:57.683 --> 00:47:59.115
it's a good thing.

425
00:47:59.117 --> 00:48:00.417
We agree on this. right?

426
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:02.018
How are are supposed
to travel

427
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.387
twenty-five hundred miles
in four days?

428
00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:07.724
All I'm saying is
we should buy plane tickets.

429
00:48:07.726 --> 00:48:08.961
With what?

430
00:48:13.198 --> 00:48:14.232
Paul?

431
00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.637
What do you say?

432
00:48:21.373 --> 00:48:24.341
I say we talk to Monroe.

433
00:48:24.343 --> 00:48:27.143
I know. I think we have
to behave like a band.

434
00:48:27.145 --> 00:48:28.445
Freddy...

435
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.413
Madge. I'm gonna blow up
in a second.

436
00:48:30.415 --> 00:48:31.450
Freddy.

437
00:48:32.317 --> 00:48:33.352
Freddy.

438
00:48:35.754 --> 00:48:37.122
Enough of this.

439
00:48:39.358 --> 00:48:40.492
I'm calling him.

440
00:48:41.226 --> 00:48:42.728
Al. truly...

441
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:46.296
clean up in here.
It's just...

442
00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:49.001
Viena. can you have the kids
come and clean this up?

443
00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:52.270
- I'll do it.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

444
00:49:03.115 --> 00:49:04.349
It's not connecting.

445
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:12.655
- Hey. lady.
- Hey.

446
00:49:12.657 --> 00:49:14.124
Hey. I... I need you to get your
little friends

447
00:49:14.126 --> 00:49:15.193
out of my office.

448
00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:19.429
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'll try
and talk to them about that.

449
00:49:19.431 --> 00:49:21.099
Yeah. You do that.

450
00:49:43.588 --> 00:49:46.623
- Hello!
- Hi. What's up?

451
00:49:46.625 --> 00:49:49.726
- Princess.
- Hello. princess.

452
00:49:49.728 --> 00:49:52.796
Ooh. what the fuck is this?

453
00:49:52.798 --> 00:49:55.432
- Oh. my God!
- What the fuck is that?

454
00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:04.474
No! I don't want it.

455
00:50:04.476 --> 00:50:07.110
Viena. we found this. like.
bowling alley last night

456
00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:12.615
and Rebecca is like.
national champion best bowler.

457
00:50:12.617 --> 00:50:14.451
She beat. like.
all the locals.

458
00:50:14.453 --> 00:50:17.220
She was so good.

459
00:50:17.222 --> 00:50:18.822
She was so good though.
it was amazing.

460
00:50:18.824 --> 00:50:21.257
And I was. like.
speaking Hebrew the whole time.

461
00:50:21.259 --> 00:50:23.093
It's just...

462
00:50:23.095 --> 00:50:25.595
- We won a motorcycle.
- You did?

463
00:50:25.597 --> 00:50:26.629
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We won...

464
00:50:26.631 --> 00:50:27.831
We won a motorcycle.

465
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:32.402
It's outside. It could be
a piece of shit.

466
00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:34.571
Oh. no. no. It's gonna
work. We should play on it.

467
00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:36.239
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

468
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:38.575
I really don't know
if this thing's gonna work.

469
00:50:38.577 --> 00:50:40.443
It works. It works.

470
00:50:40.445 --> 00:50:41.644
You did not know that.

471
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:45.815
Do you want to come?
You should come.

472
00:50:45.817 --> 00:50:48.353
- Yeah. I'll come in a second.
- Yeah. it'll be fun.

473
00:51:09.774 --> 00:51:10.809
Viena.

474
00:51:14.913 --> 00:51:17.413
- I need to ask you something.
- What?

475
00:51:17.415 --> 00:51:19.849
I'm getting a bit freaked
about Freddy.

476
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:21.319
Give him half of this.

477
00:51:29.427 --> 00:51:30.629
Don't give him more than that.

478
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.361
What do you want?

479
00:52:13.772 --> 00:52:15.807
Let me say one thing.

480
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:22.879
This Monroe guy is obviously
a crook and all. but

481
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:25.684
now. he wants to make money off
you guys. right?

482
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:33.458
Why don't you let him?

483
00:52:37.562 --> 00:52:41.497
Say you open the concert. right?

484
00:52:41.499 --> 00:52:43.668
People get to hear
the new music.

485
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.572
That'll be a good thing.
won't it?

486
00:52:52.277 --> 00:52:54.246
I... I know. It's just...

487
00:52:59.651 --> 00:53:01.286
Would you take the other half?

488
00:53:04.356 --> 00:53:05.991
I don't really like pills.

489
00:53:07.626 --> 00:53:08.660
For me?

490
00:53:10.762 --> 00:53:11.863
Please.

491
00:53:39.958 --> 00:53:41.860
Just give it a minute. okay?

492
00:53:56.308 --> 00:53:57.475
What the fuck?

493
00:53:59.377 --> 00:54:00.610
What're you doing?

494
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.692
Oh. you're so cute.

495
00:54:16.961 --> 00:54:18.963
Every time I see you. I just...

496
00:54:20.765 --> 00:54:22.801
I get pulled in by this...

497
00:54:23.668 --> 00:54:25.537
this thing you have.

498
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.874
I feel you are so pure

499
00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:33.676
that all I need to do is...

500
00:54:33.678 --> 00:54:34.979
is hurt you.

501
00:54:39.417 --> 00:54:42.085
Like I need to harm you

502
00:54:42.087 --> 00:54:43.722
and see you suffering.

503
00:54:44.956 --> 00:54:48.591
- Fuck you.
- Hey. hey.

504
00:54:48.593 --> 00:54:50.593
Listen...

505
00:54:50.595 --> 00:54:53.129
Listen.
I would never hurt you.

506
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:55.467
Okay? I'm just being honest.

507
00:54:57.068 --> 00:54:59.068
Okay.

508
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.538
I'd never hurt you.

509
00:55:03.108 --> 00:55:04.409
Okay.

510
00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:09.647
I want to tell you something.

511
00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:13.485
I want you to hear me
when I say it.

512
00:55:15.954 --> 00:55:16.986
Hmm?

513
00:55:16.988 --> 00:55:18.588
I'm going to New York tomorrow

514
00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:20.125
and I want you to come with me.

515
00:55:22.026 --> 00:55:24.827
- What?
- Let's go.

516
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:26.431
You know. together.

517
00:55:29.667 --> 00:55:32.802
You know. if I get to go there

518
00:55:32.804 --> 00:55:35.407
it'll be everything
I've dreamt about for years.

519
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:39.911
So will you come?

520
00:55:49.654 --> 00:55:51.487
- Hi.
- Oh. hey!

521
00:55:51.489 --> 00:55:53.491
So I'm going to New York.

522
00:55:56.828 --> 00:55:58.628
Alright.

523
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.764
- What about us?
- I don't know.

524
00:56:28.993 --> 00:56:30.128
What's wrong?

525
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:33.529
I just found out there's
not enough money

526
00:56:33.531 --> 00:56:35.665
coming in from New York.

527
00:56:35.667 --> 00:56:37.802
You know. so it seems like
you can't come.

528
00:56:40.872 --> 00:56:42.638
Okay.

529
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.609
- I can wait here.
- Fuck.

530
00:57:08.066 --> 00:57:09.667
Let's get you packed.

531
00:57:28.686 --> 00:57:31.120
Number of the hotel.
Call me Friday.

532
00:57:31.122 --> 00:57:32.622
That should be enough
for these days.

533
00:57:32.624 --> 00:57:33.856
Okay.

534
00:57:33.858 --> 00:57:36.127
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

535
00:57:37.662 --> 00:57:38.763
We are gonna miss you.

536
00:57:49.908 --> 00:57:51.142
Are you gonna miss me?

537
00:57:56.214 --> 00:57:58.748
I am sorry. I just...

538
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.885
I don't want to
see us kissing. okay?

539
00:59:34.012 --> 00:59:35.046
You okay?

540
00:59:38.282 --> 00:59:40.816
Why are you hanging out
in here by yourself?

541
00:59:40.818 --> 00:59:42.385
I'm just in a bad mood.

542
00:59:42.387 --> 00:59:43.986
Well. do you want to come over?
We're watching.

543
00:59:43.988 --> 00:59:45.923
like. some stupid horror movie.

544
01:01:11.008 --> 01:01:12.208
Keyes?

545
01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.877
Hey. did I wake you?

546
01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:16.278
No. What's up?

547
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.015
- Uh. I need a favor.
- What happened?

548
01:01:20.017 --> 01:01:22.754
Nothing. I just.
I need you to do something.

549
01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:51.015
Wait here a minute.

550
01:02:40.164 --> 01:02:41.530
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

551
01:02:41.532 --> 01:02:42.865
Yeah. thanks a lot.

552
01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.601
Fuck off!

553
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.113
Well. I got 300.

554
01:02:57.415 --> 01:02:58.449
Here. Hold that.

555
01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:43.626
I dropped the bike!

556
01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.030
- What?
- I dropped the bike!

557
01:03:52.103 --> 01:03:53.271
I'm sorry.

558
01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:13.157
Bitch.

559
01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.591
- What?
- Bitch!

560
01:04:27.438 --> 01:04:29.440
Yo. where the fuck
have you guys been?

561
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.199
Will you stay all night?

562
01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.336
I don't like to be here alone.

563
01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:36.674
I don't know.
I don't really like it here.

564
01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:42.213
Please.

565
01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:45.282
Stay.

566
01:06:09.573 --> 01:06:11.373
Listen.
this is important. Please.

567
01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.210
I just need to talk to Madge.
That's it.

568
01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:17.148
Hello?

569
01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.461
Where's Keyes?

570
01:06:32.463 --> 01:06:34.665
Uh. he's out in the woods
somewhere.

571
01:06:46.677 --> 01:06:48.579
What's going on with you two?

572
01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:51.582
Uh...

573
01:06:53.284 --> 01:06:55.317
Um. I'm gonna leave you
in charge

574
01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:57.686
of the money for a bit. okay?

575
01:06:57.688 --> 01:07:01.625
- Why? I mean. okay. but...
- I'll tell you later.

576
01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:29.453
Hi.

577
01:07:36.627 --> 01:07:37.661
What's wrong?

578
01:07:39.763 --> 01:07:40.865
Nothing.

579
01:07:58.516 --> 01:07:59.550
What?

580
01:08:01.685 --> 01:08:03.254
I think we should leave.

581
01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:12.528
Go where?

582
01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:13.664
Anywhere.

583
01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:16.367
Doesn't matter.

584
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:19.436
We just leave?

585
01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.742
What if these guys hit it big?

586
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:28.846
They're never gonna make it.

587
01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:34.585
And even if they do.
we don't need them.

588
01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:39.790
You mean being together?

589
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:06.650
Viena!

590
01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:58.000
We should go.

591
01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:09.580
Mr. Keyes.

592
01:10:11.348 --> 01:10:12.650
How is everything. man?

593
01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:15.817
Yeah. I'm alright.
How about you?

594
01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:17.986
Mm.

595
01:10:17.988 --> 01:10:20.057
Looks great. Mm.

596
01:10:21.692 --> 01:10:23.792
I tell you what.

597
01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:25.796
Things are gonna change
around here.

598
01:10:27.998 --> 01:10:29.598
Yeah?

599
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.569
Yeah. You can bet on it.

600
01:10:37.741 --> 01:10:40.309
Listen. guys. I. uh...

601
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:44.012
I'm sorry about this. but...

602
01:10:44.014 --> 01:10:47.785
we're gonna need to find
a solution to this situation.

603
01:10:49.687 --> 01:10:51.322
Monroe. I want my money.

604
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.091
You want your money?

605
01:10:57.361 --> 01:10:59.728
How much money do you want?

606
01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.965
- Twelve weeks. A grand.
- Hm.

607
01:11:03.567 --> 01:11:04.702
Okay.

608
01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:09.871
Here you are.

609
01:11:09.873 --> 01:11:11.106
Go on.

610
01:11:11.108 --> 01:11:12.941
But now you're done.

611
01:11:12.943 --> 01:11:14.078
Alright?

612
01:11:15.879 --> 01:11:17.014
Alright.

613
01:11:20.784 --> 01:11:22.017
Can I talk to her?

614
01:11:22.019 --> 01:11:23.685
- Come on. man.
- What is it?

615
01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:25.354
- What is it?
- What's the problem?

616
01:11:25.356 --> 01:11:27.556
You just stay right here
and let me talk to her.

617
01:11:27.558 --> 01:11:29.524
It's okay. I'm not a wolf.

618
01:11:29.526 --> 01:11:31.993
I'm not the big. bad wolf.

619
01:11:31.995 --> 01:11:33.597
I'm just gonna talk to her.

620
01:11:34.932 --> 01:11:36.800
Okay? Just talk.

621
01:11:39.403 --> 01:11:40.771
You okay. Keyes?

622
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:52.447
Hey.

623
01:11:52.449 --> 01:11:54.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

624
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:56.618
So look...

625
01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.055
I got a crazy kid
on my hands.

626
01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:03.861
You know. you messed him up.

627
01:12:05.095 --> 01:12:08.096
I know. You know.

628
01:12:08.098 --> 01:12:09.698
You think you can
come talk to him for...

629
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.967
- No. no...
- Hey. hey. hey. Keyes.

630
01:12:11.969 --> 01:12:14.071
I'm talking about talking.
That's it.

631
01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:16.473
Okay?

632
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:22.744
Hey.

633
01:12:22.746 --> 01:12:24.646
What do you think?

634
01:12:24.648 --> 01:12:26.450
You gonna go talk to him for me?

635
01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:28.719
Just talk?

636
01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:33.588
Think we can go do it now?
Yeah?

637
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:35.659
Good.

638
01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.895
Okay. sweetheart.
Let's do it.

639
01:12:48.505 --> 01:12:49.540
Keyes.

640
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.792
Come on. We need to talk.

641
01:13:09.793 --> 01:13:12.093
Freddy.

642
01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:14.598
You should come with us.
We're gonna get drinks.

643
01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:19.870
He's not gonna let you in.
Hop in the back.

644
01:13:42.493 --> 01:13:44.993
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Smash her fucking world.

645
01:13:44.995 --> 01:13:47.164
- I'm not gonna fucking do it.
- Yes. you fucking are.

646
01:14:06.116 --> 01:14:08.583
I need to look after him.

647
01:14:08.585 --> 01:14:10.185
Can you buy the drinks?

648
01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:12.289
Two whiskeys and two tequilas.

649
01:14:20.931 --> 01:14:22.666
So. you with the rock band?

650
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.868
Yeah.

651
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:31.742
You okay?

652
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:34.809
Hey.

653
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:36.046
Thank you so much.

654
01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:40.217
You want to get in with us?

655
01:15:14.618 --> 01:15:15.719
Go on.

656
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:28.732
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

657
01:15:32.135 --> 01:15:33.835
- Drink it.
- I don't want anymore. Please.

658
01:15:33.837 --> 01:15:36.037
- Just drink.
- Please.

659
01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:38.607
What do you think
we're doing now. hm?

660
01:15:38.609 --> 01:15:40.077
Drink. Now.

661
01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:46.648
Fucking drink now. More.

662
01:15:47.684 --> 01:15:48.819
Good girl.

663
01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:02.099
No. Make her take it.

664
01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.034
Drink.

665
01:16:06.036 --> 01:16:07.237
More!

666
01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:20.017
Ah. you fucked up.

667
01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:23.720
Gotta restore order.

668
01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:30.727
I didn't fuck up.

669
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.405
...the whole team goes down.

670
01:16:45.175 --> 01:16:46.875
We gotta do something.

671
01:16:46.877 --> 01:16:48.145
We gotta. um...

672
01:16:50.914 --> 01:16:52.215
restore order.

673
01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.818
And. uh...

674
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.787
And you...

675
01:16:58.789 --> 01:17:01.158
...we need you to help us.

676
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.961
Help us be strong.

677
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:09.099
And I need you to not say no.

678
01:17:14.938 --> 01:17:16.337
Do you understand?

679
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:19.710
Open it up.

680
01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:30.285
You okay?

681
01:17:30.287 --> 01:17:31.788
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

682
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.025
You gotta come with me now.
okay?

683
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:14.362
My plan is to get the
money they owe me and I'll start

684
01:18:14.364 --> 01:18:16.765
making those bracelets
I was telling you about.

685
01:18:16.767 --> 01:18:18.935
I should be able to sell them
anywhere. you know?

686
01:18:20.437 --> 01:18:22.103
What's all the fuss about?

687
01:18:22.105 --> 01:18:23.805
Just a bunch of bullshit
those guys do...

688
01:18:23.807 --> 01:18:26.040
I... I need you to hear this.

689
01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.149
How much longer
are we gonna be here for?

690
01:18:34.151 --> 01:18:35.318
Shh.

691
01:18:36.486 --> 01:18:37.521
Listen.

692
01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:39.556
Listen to this.

693
01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:04.112
You have any idea
how hard I work

694
01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:05.480
to keep this band on its feet?

695
01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:09.017
Do you know what I have to do

696
01:19:09.019 --> 01:19:10.318
to keep this thing together?

697
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.387
Do you have any idea?

698
01:19:12.389 --> 01:19:14.055
And you think you're special?

699
01:19:14.057 --> 01:19:16.291
You can come and you can come
piss on my yard?

700
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.593
Do you think you're
fucking special?

701
01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:20.929
Are you special?

702
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:22.530
I didn't mean to do anything.

703
01:19:22.532 --> 01:19:24.265
Yet...

704
01:19:24.267 --> 01:19:26.267
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
It's okay.

705
01:19:26.269 --> 01:19:28.937
It's okay.
Shh. S...

706
01:19:28.939 --> 01:19:29.973
Stop.

707
01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:35.312
It's not about being sorry.

708
01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:39.416
Now it's time... to fix it.

709
01:19:46.022 --> 01:19:47.324
I'll leave you.

710
01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:58.600
I wish I could be as
composed as he is.

711
01:19:58.602 --> 01:20:01.402
All of his thoughts
in perfect order.

712
01:20:01.404 --> 01:20:02.606
He's a brilliant man.

713
01:20:04.207 --> 01:20:06.574
Here. Drink.

714
01:20:06.576 --> 01:20:09.346
- I don't want to.
- I know you don't want to.

715
01:20:12.082 --> 01:20:14.182
There.

716
01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:15.550
Please. Please.

717
01:20:15.552 --> 01:20:17.485
Okay. just one more.

718
01:20:17.487 --> 01:20:21.391
I said take a fucking drink.
Good girl.

719
01:20:24.995 --> 01:20:27.397
Just do whatever
he fucking says.

720
01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:09.506
Monroe says
we should calm down.

721
01:21:16.646 --> 01:21:18.148
He gave me these.

722
01:21:27.357 --> 01:21:29.025
You should take these.

723
01:21:35.198 --> 01:21:37.100
No. no. no. no. no.

724
01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.969
It's okay. It's okay.

725
01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:43.006
Just please take them.

726
01:21:44.607 --> 01:21:46.309
Here you go.

727
01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.513
Please do it.

728
01:21:52.515 --> 01:21:54.584
There you go. there you go.

729
01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:16.506
You're gonna be okay.

730
01:22:18.775 --> 01:22:21.011
Hey. this is what you wanted.
isn't it?

731
01:22:53.743 --> 01:22:56.177
How many did she take?

732
01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:59.447
- I don't know. two. three?
- That's bullshit. Freddy.

733
01:22:59.449 --> 01:23:01.084
How many did you take?

734
01:23:14.097 --> 01:23:15.532
You're gonna drink this.

735
01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:23.271
As much as you can.

736
01:23:23.273 --> 01:23:26.107
I know.

737
01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:28.311
You gotta throw up those pills
before they take hold.

738
01:23:33.616 --> 01:23:35.683
Is she okay?

739
01:23:35.685 --> 01:23:36.751
You got it out of your stomach.

740
01:23:36.753 --> 01:23:37.785
That's a good thing.

741
01:23:37.787 --> 01:23:39.087
but you need to stay awake.

742
01:23:39.089 --> 01:23:40.621
Okay.

743
01:23:40.623 --> 01:23:42.690
Don't let her fall asleep.
Freddy. Okay.

744
01:23:42.692 --> 01:23:45.226
You still have
a lot in your system.

745
01:23:45.228 --> 01:23:48.429
If you fall sleep. it could be
very. very dangerous.

746
01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:50.264
Okay.

747
01:23:50.266 --> 01:23:51.801
Keep your eyes open.

748
01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.739
You're a fucking idiot. Freddy!

749
01:24:05.648 --> 01:24:08.251
This is how you wanna get
fucking famous?

750
01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.281
Shh...

751
01:25:21.758 --> 01:25:23.393
What made you go...

752
01:27:43.866 --> 01:27:45.435
You okay?
