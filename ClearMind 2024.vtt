What the hell is the Wi-Fi
password?

17
00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:20.890
I've been sending JoinMyTrip
emails
and no one's even opening them.

18
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.225
I totally answered.

19
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.643
Oh. my God.
you answered to say that

20
00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.603
you weren't going to go
to Florida.

21
00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:29.023
I mean. that was a given.
It was never even on the table.

22
00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.984
It wasn't an option.
so it doesn't even count.

23
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.778
That's like nixing the tiramisu.
Nobody wants the fucking
tiramisu.

24
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.614
-I do. I love tiramisu.
-Of course you do. honey.

25
00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.325
-Listen. I love this platter.
-Mmm.

26
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.203
-What's the Wi-Fi password?
-No idea. The kid's got my
phone.

27
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.957
Nora. sweetie. do you have a
bowl?
Like. a real bowl for the dip?

28
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.459
-Yeah. sure. This isn't a real
bowl?
-No.

29
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.421
-What's the Wi-Fi password?
-Hey. if you get on.

30
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.006
-can you check something for me?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.049
And maybe something.
uh. green or red. you know.

32
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.010
something where the color
really pops.

33
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.137
-You got it. Okay.
-Uh. Nora. Wi-Fi?

34
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.389
-Uh. "home sweet home."
-Oh. and you know what?

35
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.516
Maybe a little bit of jicama as
well.

36
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.977
You're amazing.
Fuck Shannon. no one eats
jicama!

37
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.813
-I eat jicama!
-Babe. you want these?

38
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.649
Oh. baby. what are you doing
with those?
Please throw them out.

39
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.361
Mmm. that's good. Um. fuck. is
that ours?

40
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.446
Our what?

41
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.699
Not me.

42
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.075
Kate? Kate. please.

43
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.493
Just don't throw up in the pool.

44
00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.329
I'm not gonna throw up in the
pool.

45
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.457
Daddy. look!

46
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.293
Whoa! Cannonball.

47
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.128
We're applying to the science
magnets.

48
00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.005
Oh. my gosh. that's great.
That's so amazing.

49
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.632
-Remember Ben in kindergarten?
-Yeah.

50
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.842
He had the rocking chair.
every chewable on the market.

51
00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.719
-Right. right.
-Look. look at this picture.

52
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.429
-He's even wearing a lab coat.
-One sec.

53
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.848
Oh. that's adorable. Yes. love?

54
00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.225
-Oh. hey!
-My mom said you'd give me a
bandage.

55
00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.478
-What happened?
-Max pushed me.

56
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.523
Oh. I'm sor-- Where-- where
did-- where?

57
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.693
On your-- I don't even see--
Does it hurt?

58
00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.153
-Not really.
-Okay.

59
00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.197
Well. there should be some
in the pool house. okay?

60
00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:01.115
I don't like princesses. I like
dogs.

61
00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.993
You don't like princesses. but
you like--
Oh. all right.

62
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.515
What is it? What happened?

63
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.641
She's not breathing.

64
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.476
What do you mean. she's not
breathing?

65
00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.937
-She's not breathing.
-Somebody call 911!

66
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.356
-Oh. sweetheart.
-Somebody call 911!

86
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.153
I know. such a big heart. Too
big.

87
00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:47.198
Got two stray cats
living on the porch now.

88
00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.909
Wow. Cats.

89
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.203
Yeah. She's really helped me
get over--

90
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:57.125
I mean. sorry. not get over--
get through everything.

91
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.461
-You know. letting go.
-I'm so glad.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.299
-Not that it's not okay to not
be okay.
-Mm-hmm.

93
00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.717
Thanks. Thank you.

94
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.054
She-- she has a podcast.
actually.

95
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:14.267
It was called a must-listen
by Christian Countdown last
month.

96
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.227
Uh. Rolling Holy.

97
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:20.439
Uh-- I know. I know. it's a
cute name-- but it's number six
on the charts.

98
00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.774
-Oh. gosh.
-Yeah.

99
00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.818
I'm gonna have her
talk to David this weekend.

100
00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.863
You know. he's got that show on.
um. whatever network it is.

101
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.323
But. uh. you know.
podcasts are huge right now.

102
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:32.326
I'm sorry. this weekend?

103
00:07:33.327 --> 00:07:37.081
-Wow. They're doing it? You're
going?
-Well...

104
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.166
Well...

105
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.878
-it is a tradition.
-Our tradition.

106
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.256
And to honor that.
Shannon decided to host.

107
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.049
-Without me.
-For you.

108
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.177
Without you.

109
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.555
Look. you know they'd love to
see you.

110
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.348
-Oh. I'm sure.
-When you're ready.

111
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.186
Which. um. actually...

112
00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.230
-there's something that. um.
I've been--
-Listen. I'm sorry.

113
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.982
Do you know if it's time?

114
00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.276
-Uh...
-I really don't wanna cut it
short.

115
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.903
-The session?
-Right. Uh...

116
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:12.116
Listen. are you sure
that this is the right way
to be moving on?

117
00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.451
I mean. you know Lily.

118
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.203
I just wanna make sure
she's helping

119
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.370
and not hurting.

120
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.872
Um. I'm gonna head back

121
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.498
and use the restroom
if that's okay?

122
00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:20.917
Come on. Nora.

123
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.168
Thanks for the ride. Michael.

124
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.587
I'm so happy you've healed.

125
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:29.008
That's not fair. Nora.
We deserve another chance. We
both do.

126
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.676
You're allergic to cats.

127
00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.678
Not anymore.

128
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.763
Well.

129
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.474
What a blessing.

130
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.977
I hope you have fun this
weekend. Michael.
Letting go.

131
00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.687
You definitely deserve it.

132
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.397
Nora. please don't...

133
00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:48.611
What do you mean. plateau?
It's repeat exposure. that's
how it works.

134
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.238
Michael has a new girlfriend.

135
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.739
-Does he?
-Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:52.990
She has her own podcast.

137
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.660
It's. like. on some top-ten list
or something.

138
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.372
Oh. please. Anyone can have a
podcast.
You're making actual change.

139
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.374
Besides.
you've only been with us for
like. what?

140
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.917
-Two months.
-That's nothing.

141
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.919
It used to take you two months
to pick out an outfit.

142
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.881
-Oh. my God. Really?
-In high school. Gary! Kids are
mean.

143
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.969
Not to you. God. she was so
cheerful.
I mean. like. happy-happy.

144
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.638
-Was I?
-Anyway. they're your friends.

145
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.473
-And yours.
-Oh. yeah?

146
00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.268
You call being the hook-up
to my weed dealer brother a
friendship?

147
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.353
-How is Walt?
-Oh. my God. VP of Sales.

148
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.521
Midwest division.

149
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.564
But. I mean.
pharmaceuticals are huge
right now.

150
00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:29.819
Anyway. patience.
Memory is tricky.
Yeah? We got lots of loose ends.

151
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.362
How will I know when I'm ready?

152
00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.781
You'll know. We'll know.

153
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.452
Okay. Let's start with the bird
cam.
and let's get our baseline.

154
00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.870
-Okay.
-Okay. does that feel good?

155
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.455
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Thank you. Ger.

156
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.375
All right. Let's get those
birds going.

157
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.586
Okay.

158
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.547
Busy day in the garden today.

159
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:55.344
Oh. no. Her nest. Again?

160
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.139
Yeah. it was a hawk this time.
They'd been circling the day
before.

161
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.349
There were. like.
three or four eggs in there.

162
00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:01.851
That is so sad.

163
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.270
Well. you can't use old wood
to make a new nest.

164
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.230
-She's starting again.
-I know.

165
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:08.733
Are those eggshells?

166
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.110
So morbid. right?
Talk about not turning the
trauma wheel.

167
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.863
Well. you know what? Birds
aren't
exactly known for their brains.

168
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.489
I thought they were smart.

169
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:18.576
Oh. are they? I don't know.
I mean. they're birds.

170
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.369
Yeah. they have tiny heads.

171
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.246
At least she won't forget.

172
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:26.083
Memory is the enemy. okay?
Don't be that bird.

173
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:29.920
You're right. You're right.
Let's try. Lily. Let's see if
it's time.

174
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.548
Okay. all right. all right.
Gary's gonna come get you
hooked up.

175
00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:33.632
No. no. no.

176
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.178
Without the headset. In person.

177
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.180
No. We are getting there. okay?

178
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.599
-Your startle reflex is--
-Nonexistent. I don't even
flinch.

179
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.392
Which is how we know it's
working.

180
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.603
Okay. are you going this
weekend?

181
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.021
I heard Shannon's hosting.

182
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:50.149
No. I mean. maybe.
No. I mean. I'm just-- I'm
having--

183
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.234
-I haven't--
-They didn't even invite me.

184
00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.362
Have you been sleeping?

185
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.280
Okay. Gary. can I-- Oh. he's
right there.

186
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.199
Can I get two milligrams of
Midazolam?

187
00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.534
Okay. girl. Get the dizzle.

188
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.411
Maybe I don't need it. Maybe I
should try.

189
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:05.748
It's not that easy.
We would need Bob to sign off.
We would need releases.

190
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.875
To see our friends?

191
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:11.087
Look how far you've come. Lily.
You're practically a doctor now.

192
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.171
Well...

193
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.048
Maybe now they'll stop
hitting you up for. like.

194
00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.966
free yoga or Walt's weed.

195
00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.427
Right? Right.

196
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.638
So Shannon's hosting. right?
She's got the room.

197
00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.807
She's got more than the room.
She has a whole lake house now.

198
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.518
Her grandpa finally kicked it.
Yeah. A whole house.

199
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.019
Really? Like in my sim?

200
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:29.146
Well. it was easy to replicate.

201
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.107
and I figured you would go there
eventually.

202
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.817
-so it would be. you know--
-Familiar.

203
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.318
-Yeah.
-How perfect.

204
00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:36.737
Well. not yet.
I mean. we still gotta build it
out.

205
00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.948
-It's-- it's early.
-K-ville. though. That's not
far.

206
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.201
Special delivery.
We're out of two. so I got you
a four.

207
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.831
Oh. wow. You ate this morning.
right?

208
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.958
Lily. come on.
I'll be your surprise guest.

209
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.709
Oh. it would be a surprise.

210
00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.461
-And they would be--
-So happy to see me.

211
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.588
-Well...
-Okay. let's get you hooked in.

212
00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:56.257
-Okay.
-I will check your levels.

213
00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.218
-I'm not getting hooked up.
-What are you talking about?
No. wha--

214
00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.388
Please. you have to be careful
with that. Please.
I need you to stop touching.

215
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:06.267
-You stop touching!
-Hey. time out. Gary. over here.

216
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.270
Nora. you don't just show up.
okay?
That's not how it works.

217
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.772
Do you want me to get Bob
or somebody from up on four?

218
00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:13.983
Oh. fuck Bob. What the fuck
does Bob know?

219
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.776
He is trained in the five
stages of grief.

220
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.778
I thought there were seven.

221
00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:20.322
-You're thinking of seven
habits.
-That was such a good book.

222
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.950
Yeah. well.
he doesn't know grief like I
know grief.

223
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.034
-Oh. okay.
-So fuck him.

224
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.661
There are seven fucking stages
to mine.

225
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.789
All right. all right.
Well. we're gonna put this on.
and then we're-- Nora!

226
00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:32.710
-You are wasting time.
-He is starting over. Lily.

227
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.628
Look. we're gonna get a
baseline.

228
00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:37.590
We're gonna watch the bird cam.
Maybe she made a new nest.

229
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.384
I don't want a fucking baseline.

230
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.887
-I don't want a new nest!
-Hey!

231
00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.638
Memory is the enemy.

232
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.721
Okay.

233
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.723
Hey. babe. did you get ice?
I told you to get ice.

234
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.517
Yeah. yeah. I got it.
I got it right there.

235
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.769
Um. got a bag. put it by the
cooler.

236
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:32.978
One bag?

237
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:35.439
Well. the store.
they were down to two.

238
00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:36.982
and I didn't wanna
clean 'em out. so.

239
00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:38.234
Of ice?

240
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.985
-Well. it's hot. babe.
-Exactly!

241
00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.071
Okay. Don't worry about it.

242
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.614
I'll go to the store
and I'll get some more.

243
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.616
No. Tom. it's too late.
Come on. Mark is probably--

244
00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:49.370
Okay. you know what. then?
I will-- I will make some.

245
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.331
-I'll go into the house and I
will--
-What? Watch water freeze?

246
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.750
-Is that what you're gonna do?
-You're so-- Oh. I love you.

247
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.835
-You're gonna watch water
freeze? Okay.
-I love you!

248
00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.921
-Yes. okay. Leave me alone.
-I love you. Shannon.

249
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.090
No. he's not staying there.

250
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.759
We told some assistant that.
like. a billion times.

251
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.221
I didn't say that!

252
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:13.435
No. linens! Linens. Jesus. who
the hell
needs designer fuckin' lemons?

253
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.897
What? Oh. fuck off.

254
00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:18.524
How's your mother. David?

255
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.027
Very funny.

256
00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:25.406
It would've killed him
to build a cell tower out here?

257
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.366
Hey. man.
does this look upside-down to
you?

258
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.368
Dude. uh. wrong person to ask.

259
00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:31.370
So it's a wireless weekend.
David.

260
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.164
Oh. yes. Yes. totally. Yes. I
know.

261
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:37.918
And also. Tom would love help
with these chairs.
So sit. come on. build.

262
00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:39.920
Come on. I got you. bro. I got
you.

263
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.007
Hey. thank you. Um. yep.
Totally.

264
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:45.593
Uh. just one last call.
One last call.

265
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.136
-Oh. one last call.
-Last call.

266
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.596
-I don't believe you.
-Yes.

267
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.265
Yes. hi. Hi. David. yes.
Remember me?

268
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.476
Well. uh. fuck you.
and I need to speak to business
affairs.

269
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:55.769
Thank you.

270
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.790
I mean.
what are they shooting at?

271
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.334
I've seen. like.
three squirrels.

272
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.585
Well. two now.

273
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.714
-Hey. babe?
-Yeah.

274
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.092
That light in the shed? It's
out.

275
00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.553
-I thought we fixed that.
-We?

276
00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:33.265
You. You. babe.

277
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.142
I love a woman who can get
things done.

278
00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:38.312
When the guy comes to fix the
hot tub.
he can do the shed too.

279
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:43.275
-All right.
-Oh. my God! This is amazing!

280
00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.319
Ah! It's like a late 80s summer
house.

281
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.946
Minus. you know. the wine
coolers.
making out with the neighbor.

282
00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:49.406
and taking a shit in the bushes!

283
00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:51.367
-What is up?
-You made it.

284
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.577
Oh my God.
I can't believe I haven't been
here.

285
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.995
Hoarder. You house hoarder!

286
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.289
-You've totally been here.
-Have I?

287
00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.833
Yes. my baby-moon. remember?

288
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:00.918
Before Ryder.

289
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:05.005
Oh. God. Well. I was tipsy
for a lot of that. so. fresh
eyes!

290
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:08.092
You're so sweaty. What. did you
walk here all the way
from Walnut Creek?

291
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.219
I just got confused.
I thought it was closer to town.

292
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.680
I had to stop off at the
mini-mart for.
you know. essentials.

293
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.349
-The guy didn't wanna wait--
Hello. hello!
-Hey! Katie. fist bump.

294
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.434
Oh. no. fist bumps
are for four-year-olds. Tom.

295
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:18.852
Give me some hugs.

296
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:21.939
All righty. You want a drink?
Can I get you a drink?

297
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.108
Yes. please. I would love--

298
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.693
Another six-pack.
'cause one's never enough.

299
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.194
Oh. good. My sponsor's here.

300
00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:28.821
Spouse. sorry. spouser.
Ex-spouser.

301
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.781
Guess I won't be
working the steps this weekend.

302
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.409
-Which were always so effective!
-It was kinda hard to work step
nine

303
00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.120
over the sound of you having sex
with strangers you met on the
internet.

304
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.288
Oh. God! Here we go.

305
00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:40.791
And wine comes in four-packs.
not six.
I'm not a heathen.

306
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.127
Well. once it's pull-tab.
it's pretty irrelevant. right?

307
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.337
I mean. you're basically
drinking booze from a juice box.

308
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.465
Okay. You come inside with me.
and the boys are going to build
furniture.

309
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:50.342
Yeah. we're building chairs.
Well. Tom is.

310
00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.344
Well. you know. Gotta sit
somewhere.

311
00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.221
Everything was rotted through
when we got here.

312
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:56.265
-so I figured while I have
you...
-Oh. my God. totally.

313
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.934
David loves building furniture.
He goes to a very peaceful
place.

314
00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:01.979
If someone could open a
hardware bag without blasting
lug nuts everywhere...

315
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.314
Who opens bags with scissors.
David?

316
00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.691
-Everyone!
-No one!

317
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.735
-Okay. Kate! Come on.
-I'm coming.

318
00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.486
Well. it's good to see you.
Kate.

319
00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.655
Oh. God. whatever. Eat me.

320
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:15.451
Okay. Yeah. You don't hear that
every day.

321
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.494
-I hear it a lot.
-Uh-oh.

322
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:21.123
Well. you know what? We'll let
them do their thing
and we'll do our thing. huh?

323
00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.917
We'll have a man weekend.
A "meekend." How about that?

324
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.091
Did you ever go see Dr. Bindle?

325
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:35.095
You can't tell?
Don't I seem calm. consciously
uncoupled?

326
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.806
No. no. you do. you do. Just...

327
00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:42.394
Do you mind? Tiny slices.

328
00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:45.147
We did go.

329
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.608
It was--
Well. he's still sleeping in
the attic.

330
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.401
and we're still
getting divorced eventually.

331
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:51.487
But at least we can share
fridge space

332
00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:52.946
without shitting
in each other's yogurt.

333
00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:55.324
You know?
I mean. it would be far more
satisfying

334
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.993
to wrap his balls in cheesecloth
and have them permanently
pressed--

335
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:00.954
I'm so sorry.
Thinner slices. Just. like...

336
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:04.082
Are you gonna. like.
tweet the cheese plate?

337
00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.918
Well. not anymore.

338
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.961
No. we're good. We're good.

339
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.589
I just wouldn't say we're
thriving.

340
00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.508
Oh. God. man. Who is?

341
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:15.594
Hey. I'm just gonna
keep working on my novel.

342
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.471
playing some fantasy football.

343
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:22.226
A little guitar. BingingWildwood.
Bro. that shit is crazy.

344
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:26.230
Those fuckers. they keep
eating each other. What the
fuck?

345
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.943
Yeah. Kinda makes you appreciate
what you have. you know?

346
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.570
Right. Right.

347
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.155
So you guys are...

348
00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.907
There's a lot of paperwork
involved.

349
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.700
-Divorce. you know.
-Yeah.

350
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.995
Plus. we. uh. you know. we still
have sex every now and again.
so...

351
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:48.544
Nice. Um. yeah. we're still.
uh. checking that box. So...
yeah.

352
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:51.588
-Anyway. I get it.
-Oh. do you. though?

353
00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:55.134
Tom doesn't seem like a
sex-with-strangers-I-met-
on-the-internet kinda guy.

354
00:18:55.134 --> 00:19:00.472
No. No. he's too...
lazy for that.

355
00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.891
-Probably. but...
-Too nice to waitstaff?

356
00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.771
Well. you know. after everything
happened and I was contagious
with misfortune.

357
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.525
he was like this sweet. sad.
collaterally damaged dog

358
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.527
just waiting to be re-homed.

359
00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:15.362
What is that?

360
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.448
Oh. God. it's the wiring.

361
00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.409
The guy was supposed to come
weeks ago.

362
00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.786
It's the shed. the hot tub.
There's no AC.

363
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.121
and with the weather
we've been having...

364
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.456
-Here's hoping we don't fry.
-Mm-hmm.

365
00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:29.668
-Oh. God.
-Wow.

366
00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:32.212
-What is this for?
-Mine didn't come with that.

367
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:33.672
Jesus. it's heavy.

368
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.549
Yeah. okay. Well. let's not.
you know--

369
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.802
Maybe they include this so.
uh. when you assemble it
backwards.

370
00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.512
you got to smash it.

371
00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.389
-Right. Right.
-Instead of starting over.

372
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:45.183
Well. I'm guessing you got the
bench here.

373
00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:48.478
Shit. dude.

374
00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.607
Yeah. Hunters. opening weekend.

375
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.195
-Should we be wearing something
bright?
-Brighter than those shorts?

376
00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:59.239
These are nice. dude.

377
00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:01.575
No. you're good. You're good.

378
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:09.041
Hey. um...
would you say you're having
more sex now

379
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.084
-or when you were married?
-God. I don't know.

380
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:15.881
I mean. maybe now. but it's
a pain in the ass. man. Don't
do it.

381
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.592
Plus. married dudes live longer.
They've done studies.

382
00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.344
Happily?

383
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.054
It doesn't matter. They just do.

384
00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:25.015
Anyways. I've seen Shannon
at a school board meeting.

385
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.309
I would not wanna see her in
family court.

386
00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.311
-No. you don't.
-No.

387
00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.690
Shit. man.

388
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.330
Does it feel like
we're the only ones here?

389
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.875
Well. summer's done.
It's hunting season. The locals
take over.

390
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.961
Well. we're kind of locals.

391
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:56.880
Right. babe? I mean.
we just gotta ease into it. you
know?

392
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.800
-Let go a little.
-I let go.

393
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.845
Yeah. yeah. No. you do.

394
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:08.058
Thank you. Anyway. Tom and I.
after everything happened.

395
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.353
we just wanted a way
to escape the city. you know?

396
00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.398
-And I can't believe it's only
been--
-A year.

397
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.858
-Exactly.
-Almost to the day.

398
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.151
It's so fucked up.

399
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.409
Has anyone talked to her?

400
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:26.660
Barely.

401
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.788
Not since that whole
celebration-of-life thing at
school.

402
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.835
I mean. I-- You know. I tried
to stay in touch for a while.
but--

403
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.920
That was very satisfying.

404
00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:40.882
-Biodegradable. right?
-What. the golf balls?

405
00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:43.635
I don't know. I thought they
were yours.

406
00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.720
-No?
-Oops.

407
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:54.688
So. what. uh-- what kind of
wildlife
do you get out here?

408
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:57.649
-Ducks.
-I mean what kind of furry
wildlife?

409
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.860
-Please. ducks.
-They're not wildlife?

410
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.361
I mean. they're ducks.

411
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:04.322
I don't know. Like. squirrels.
skunks.

412
00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:07.200
-Right. babe?
-We're not really woods people.
guys.

413
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.162
-What the fuck? Then why are we
here?
-Someone had to host.

414
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.622
And the whole. you know.
nature-is-cleansing thing.

415
00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:14.958
And no one else offered.
It might as well be me.

416
00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:18.128
At least I could put together
a cheese plate. No offense to
Nora.

417
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.546
I think this was Lily's idea.

418
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:22.424
Remember when she was
texting everyone about her
healer

419
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.634
and. like. drinking chloroform
and whatever?

420
00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:26.803
Oh. yeah. it was chlorophyll.
Plant-based.

421
00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:29.723
-Well. sorry. Not a scientist.
-She is persuasive.

422
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:31.683
Yeah. she's a free spirit.

423
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:33.810
Very free spirit.

424
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.645
God. I just never understood
Nora's thing with her.

425
00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:39.399
High school. Years that don't
forget.

426
00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:41.234
Maybe it's guilt. you know?

427
00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:43.779
I mean. we all got out.
had lives. came back.

428
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:48.950
-She's exactly where we left
her.
-Her brother had very good weed.

429
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.245
You know. what is she.
like. a therapist now? Or a--

430
00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:54.289
-I don't know.
-A life coach? That's cool.

431
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.166
Well. it's always the crazy
ones.

432
00:22:57.417 --> 00:23:00.295
-Speaking of which...
-Oh. my God.

433
00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:01.963
-Is that--
-Of course it is.

434
00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:04.299
I mean. only Lily could convince
a fisherman to be her ride.

435
00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:05.717
Oh. my God.

436
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.385
Oh. my God.

437
00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:11.181
Oh. my God.

438
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:15.727
-Welcome to paradise.
-I forgot how adorable this
place is.

439
00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.687
I mean.
I would've been here every
weekend.

440
00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:20.107
Well. you know.
Grandpa was alive until
recently. so.

441
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.067
-Yeah. these vibes. they're so
good.
-Yeah?

442
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.027
-Yeah.
-Did you sage it? I bet you
saged it.

443
00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:26.988
I do-- I-- I mean. Tom has
allergies. so.

444
00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:29.032
Okay. Lil.
I'll put this in the house for
you.

445
00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:31.159
Oh. thank you. Tom. Still tall.

446
00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:34.955
-What is up? Hey.
-Hey.

447
00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:37.332
-Wow. you look good.
-So good.

448
00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:40.377
-Hi. hi. hi. hi. hi.
-Hi. hi.

449
00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:42.129
You know. I didn't tip him.

450
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.423
-You think I should've tipped
him?
-Well. yeah. probably.

451
00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.424
Isn't he. like.
a cab on water or whatever?

452
00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.218
No. I think he was just
a fisherman.

453
00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:51.054
Local flavor.
I mean. he didn't say much.

454
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.641
He's probably psyched to have
more than just dead fish on his
boat.

455
00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:57.853
Well. maybe the no-bra thing
silenced him.

456
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.855
Oh. God. Well...

457
00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:03.525
-He did look stunned.
-I'm sure.

458
00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:05.277
-Okay. let's go.
-Okay.

459
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.320
I guess it's just gonna be
that kind of weekend.

460
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.865
It doesn't have to be. It's
just starting.

461
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:12.492
-I can't believe this is all
yours.
-Yeah. right?

462
00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:14.828
Please.

463
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:17.706
Yeah. look at the. uh-- look at
hour hand.

464
00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.666
-Whoo. See that?
-Diamonds?

465
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.792
Gothan dag!

466
00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.919
Mikey!

467
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:24.462
-Hey!
-Yo!

468
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.382
What's up?

469
00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.179
-How you doing?
- Hvat segir thu!

470
00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.847
What is that?

471
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.600
That is Old Norse. my friend.
I'm getting back to my roots.

472
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.936
Language of the Vikings.
Yeah. except less village
sacking.

473
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.314
Oh. come on. man. Sack a
village.

474
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.816
You know what sacking is. right?
It's not like a county fair.

475
00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.568
You know what?
I should learn a language.

476
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.695
Finally get to Paris and write
my novel.

477
00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.363
My God. now you wanna go to
Paris?

478
00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:53.283
Yeah. And hi. I'm Tom. Nice to
meet you.

479
00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:55.160
Shelby. hi. Thanks for having
me.

480
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.456
-Oh. absolutely.
-Shelby. uh. sorry. Dave. David.

481
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:02.292
-Daveed. Whatever works.
-Hi. Kate.

482
00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.461
-Hey.
-I'm sorry. I didn't know where
to park.

483
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.296
-I had no idea it was--
-Oh. the two miles?

484
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.965
Yeah. Grandpa didn't like
visitors parking down here.
Sorry.

485
00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.467
Eg segi allt gott.

486
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.551
Oh. boy.

487
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:14.346
All right. So. hey. man. are you
playing fantasy football this
year?

488
00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.473
-I didn't see your name on it.
-Yeah. No. no. no. no.

489
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:20.018
No. fresh start. You know.
Shelby.
You know. I'm on a path.

490
00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:22.604
-Hi. I'm Lily.
-New me.

491
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:24.147
-Right.
-You've probably heard a lot.

492
00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.816
-Well. you know. it's all true.
-Oh.

493
00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:30.403
Oh. my God. you're so tiny.
Tiny. little fairy.

494
00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:31.613
All right.

495
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:34.366
So. are you guys. like--
Did you come together?

496
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.534
-Oh. God. No. no. No.
-Oh. no. no. no. no.

497
00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:38.912
-We can't even--
-We kinda still live together.

498
00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:41.122
Yeah. but we don't drive
together.
I used to have to go limp

499
00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:43.500
-in the front seat like a rag
doll.
-She is the worst passenger.

500
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.669
Apparently it's safer.
so my body just knew what to do.

501
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:47.963
-And our therapist said-- Well--
-Our ex-therapist.

502
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:49.756
-Suggested--
-That we drive separately.

503
00:25:49.756 --> 00:25:51.049
Oh. I hear you.

504
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.509
When Michael drives.

505
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:55.178
I just close my eyes
and let Jesus take the wheel.

506
00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:56.805
She does. And He does.

507
00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.808
It's not really safe to drive
in sandals either. though. so.

508
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.185
Hey. Mike.
I'm gonna grab these bags for
you. okay?

509
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.561
-Oh. no. no. no. I'm fine.
-Yeah?

510
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.854
Yeah. no. About the bags.

511
00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:06.940
if they drip. um. it's because--

512
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.983
Well. it's not all-- I mean.

513
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:09.567
some of it's closed.
but some of it's--

514
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.778
Deer meat. I usually bring my
own.

515
00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:14.114
That way I know
it's been humanely slaughtered.

516
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:16.574
-Right. Okay.
-See. this way it won't get on
the rug.

517
00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:18.368
It comes out with a little bit
of bleach.

518
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.203
but I'll just use a little bit
of cooler space.

519
00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:21.288
Yeah.

520
00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:25.834
Oh. gosh. Do y'all have any
more ice?

521
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.212
RAGE

522
00:26:29.212 --> 00:26:32.799
They were huge.
Like pterodactyls. They just
kept--

523
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.384
So. what are we doing?

524
00:26:34.384 --> 00:26:37.220
Oh. just. uh. one emotion.
Anything that comes to mind.

525
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.930
Well. we're in this cycle right
now.

526
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.349
Saturn's trajectory
and its forcefield

527
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.143
is essentially being attacked

528
00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:46.146
by all the carbon particles put
in the air
from homogenized milk.

529
00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:49.399
It's affecting the entire
animal kingdom.

530
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.110
But the dairy lobby is so
strong.
no one's talking about it.

531
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.695
That sounds kinda fake.

532
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:56.406
Shelby does a lot
of deep dives for the podcast.

533
00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:59.284
Springa inn Ginnungagap.
"Leaps into the void."

534
00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:01.953
Okay.

535
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.000
Oh no. no. no.
It's just one emotion per strip.
You've got three here.

536
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.460
Sometimes I feel three things.

537
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.005
Okay. well. just for the
purposes of the game.
I'm just gonna-- Yeah?

538
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:13.757
You said you were gonna
take the weekend off.

539
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:16.718
We haven't seen each other in
months.
It's a party game.

540
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.762
-Yeah. you're right.
-What about pigeons?

541
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:21.890
-We still have pigeons?-Rahvns. rahvns allt!

542
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.894
It was ravens. you know.
that Noah sent to test the water
levels after the flood.

543
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:27.562
How the ravens go. so go we.

544
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:30.273
Did they die. or...
I feel like I didn't read that
one.

545
00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:34.819
"For the Lord will execute
judgment by fire.
and by his sword on all flesh.

546
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:38.406
and those slain by the Lord
will be many."
Isaiah 66.

547
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:42.452
Shelby. could I get you
something
to drink? Some wine. tequila?

548
00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:46.081
-I'll just have water.
-Swim time! Who's coming?

549
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.583
-Shannon. give me a lift!
-Okay. no. but wait. wait. wait.

550
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:51.127
-No. I thought we were gonna--
-Later. later. Come with me.

551
00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:53.213
In a few more cocktails.
I may no longer float!

552
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.299
Yeah. yeah. yeah. but it's been
a big year. and I wanna make
sure--

553
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:57.509
Tap or seltzer?

554
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.886
Good Lord's water is fine by me.

555
00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:07.268
♪ Come on and follow me ♪

556
00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:09.187
♪ No matter where we go ♪

557
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:13.274
♪ We'll be side by side
And baby. that's for sure ♪

558
00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:16.569
♪ So take what you want from
me ♪

559
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.323
I mean. how is that where
Michael landed?

560
00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:24.869
I don't know.
Farthest distance. least
familiar.

561
00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:27.831
I mean. I used to always
fantasize about running away

562
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.916
to work in a gas station in
Montana.

563
00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:32.877
I mean. just for a life
of managed expectations.

564
00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:37.841
Oh. yeah. I mean.
that's a lot of standing
upright. but...

565
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:40.802
But maybe that's just what it
is now.

566
00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:43.054
Faith. you know? For young
people.

567
00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.931
Choose your own Jesus.

568
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:48.893
When I was a kid. it was like
parents playing tambourine
in a gymnasium.

569
00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:52.355
-Ooh. creepy ones?
-No. no. Regular.

570
00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.775
Well. things have changed.

571
00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:58.653
-People are--
-Panicked. Fervent. Feverish.

572
00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:00.655
-Don't you think?
-I do. yeah.

573
00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:02.615
-Yeah.
-Max is really into dinosaurs
again.

574
00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:05.326
so we're constantly reading
about
the extinction of the species

575
00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:08.288
and it's harrowing. I mean. I
feel like we are on the cusp of
it.

576
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.331
you know? Re-extinction.

577
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:14.502
We're all gonna be dead
and they'll start over. New
amoebas.

578
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:18.756
Yep. It's free-floating anxiety.
My kids have it too.

579
00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:21.092
Just waiting for the other shoe
to drop.

580
00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.761
Yes. the apocalypse.

581
00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:28.349
Forever preserved in
a layer of sediment and lava.

582
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:30.101
Well. on that note.

583
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:34.147
-You like that?
-Oh. God. yeah.

584
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:38.902
Yeah? That's your kidneys
telling you to let go.

585
00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:40.737
Here?

586
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:43.948
You know. I'm usually so focused
on my client's needs.

587
00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:46.409
It's nice to just. you know.
be along for the ride.

588
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:50.455
I roll for Jesus.
That's my therapy every Friday
night.

589
00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.540
Yeah. Shelby's on a team.
They're pretty good.

590
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.627
-The Pinto Holy Rollers.
-Oh. so cute.

591
00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.670
Hey. do you have. like.
a PhD or something?

592
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.507
No. no. No. I mean.
nobody really does that anymore.

593
00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.217
It's not cost-effective.

594
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:04.427
Ours is a very targeted program.

595
00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:08.014
and it helps people
with trauma. depression.
phobias.

596
00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:09.390
So. therapy?

597
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.810
Without the therapist.
We put the healing in your
hands.

598
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.313
-Oh. gosh. Is that safe?
-Oh. absolutely.

599
00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:19.067
I mean. you're not covered in
spiders.
you're not flying a plane.

600
00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:22.362
-You just think you are.
-I have this recurring dream...

601
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:25.740
where I'm parasailing
wearing a sandwich board.

602
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.075
Nothing underneath.

603
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.703
It's actually very freeing.

604
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:36.000
For a while. I had this one
where I was stuffed
above the ceiling tiles.

605
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.504
You know. the-- the ones
with the tiny little holes?

606
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:44.592
And this old woman came through
with a giant spackler

607
00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:46.844
covered in. like. nut butter.

608
00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:51.057
And she just started
filling them in. one by one.

609
00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:57.397
Anyway. Tom. Uh. we tailor each
sim--

610
00:30:57.397 --> 00:31:00.441
simulation-- to the client's
needs.
put it on repeat

611
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.151
until they don't need it
anymore.

612
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.821
You can see the trauma
being flushed out of their
system.

613
00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:07.699
I was incredibly hairy growing
up.

614
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:11.327
Mama would find me in the
kitchen trying to burn off
all my arm hair.

615
00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:14.289
-It always grew back.
-Well. they say a third of us

616
00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:17.917
were originally birds. Land
dwellers.
sky dwellers. water dwellers.

617
00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:21.754
We all get eaten up by someone.
Anyway. that's when I found the
Lord.

618
00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:25.258
"For every beast of the forest
is mine."
Psalm 50.

619
00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:28.803
Oh. speaking of. here comes
Shannon.
Are we hungry?

620
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.221
-Starving.
-Yeah.

621
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.557
Oh. I'd love to put
my deer meat in the fridge.

622
00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.309
I don't think it'll keep out
here.

623
00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.060
Okay. Who's on deer meat?

624
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.813
I like to put the liver
and the heart in the cheese
drawer.

625
00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.523
otherwise it'll just freeze
right up.

626
00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:51.451
Oh. God.

627
00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:06.257
Oh. my God!
Nora. I didn't even see you
there.

628
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:09.344
Fuck. are you okay? You're
soaking.

629
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:12.347
I was looking for something.
And I fell in.

630
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:15.183
Oh. fuck. Okay. Uh. Shannon!

631
00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:18.144
Uh. here. Um. here. put this on.

632
00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:19.812
We didn't even know
you were coming.

633
00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.397
I didn't want anyone
to make a fuss.

634
00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:23.232
Well. do you have clothes?
Do you have a bag?

635
00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.234
-I'm not staying.
-Well. of course you're staying.

636
00:32:25.234 --> 00:32:27.445
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Nora!

637
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.739
When did you-- I'm so glad
you're here.

638
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:32.450
-Oh. my God. you're soaking.
-Yeah. she fell in. apparently.

639
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.203
Oh. okay. Right. right.
Well. um. let's get you some--

640
00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:37.372
-Well. I have clothes. She can
borrow--
-No clothes?

641
00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:39.540
-I'm not staying.
-Oh. of course you're staying.

642
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.250
Don't be absurd. Michael!

643
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.587
-Nora.
-Michael.

644
00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:48.007
I thought I'd stop by to say hi.

645
00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:54.222
I honestly almost shit myself.
Like. fully shit myself.

646
00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:55.932
-She looks so lost.
-Yeah.

647
00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:58.893
"Naked I come from my mother's
womb
and naked I shall return there."

648
00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:00.019
-No.
-Job.

649
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:01.979
No. no. no. not naked. She
just...

650
00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:03.564
I'm sorry. why is Nora here?

651
00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:05.608
-I have no idea.
-Was it Michael. you think?

652
00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.276
I told him to. but I know he
didn't.

653
00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:08.903
-Well. it wasn't me.
-I did.

654
00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:10.780
-What the fuck?
-What?

655
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.990
-I knew I should've bailed.
-She said she was ready.

656
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.410
I could be home jerking off in
my attic.

657
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.162
-"Like Jesus rising from the
ashes..."
-It's trigger therapy.

658
00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:20.540
and you're her triggers.

659
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.458
I'm sorry. you're her therapist
now?

660
00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:25.086
-It's more of a spiritual guide.
-Oh. my God!

661
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.630
-I'm still working on my hours.
-This seems advanced for that.

662
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.675
Well. it's not like we don't
trust you.
because yoga was cool.

663
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:34.137
Oh. my God. Just say it. Tom.
It's dangerous. it's selfish.

664
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:37.265
and it ruins our weekend. which
we deserve because life is hard
enough.

665
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.016
Her life is a little harder.

666
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:44.188
Well. one of my biggest
triggers is flesh.
Bloody flesh in particular.

667
00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:49.736
So I keep it with me until I can
experience it in my life
without anxiety.

668
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:53.614
-I'm afraid to ask.
-Look. Lil. we're here to relax.

669
00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:55.450
-This is--
-It's not helpful to her.

670
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.744
Right. It's not like she's not
invited.

671
00:33:57.744 --> 00:34:00.204
Well. you're wrong.
It's cathartic. and it's
life-changing.

672
00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.539
Here's hoping.

673
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:04.625
And if nothing else. at least
we'll have some great
conversations.

674
00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:08.087
some fresh air. and home-cooked
baby fawn.

675
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.271
Can I get you something?

676
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.315
Nora?

677
00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:29.400
Sorry?

678
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.736
To drink. Do you want a soda.
or--

679
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.237
How did you meet Michael?

680
00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:37.241
Oh. um. in grief group.

681
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.912
-I thought he might have
mentioned.
-No. he didn't.

682
00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:46.459
You're not really friends with
them. huh?

683
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:51.547
Oh. well. I mean. they-- they
seem nice.

684
00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:54.467
It's just Michael keeps things
pretty...

685
00:34:55.968 --> 00:35:00.097
Well. he's sad. you know.
It's not like he's forgotten
or--

686
00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:01.516
Do you have any kids?

687
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.100
Not yet. no.

688
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.187
-But actually--
-Well. when you do. you'll
understand.

689
00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.439
It's. um-- it's just different.

690
00:35:09.565 --> 00:35:11.400
I didn't even know if I wanted
kids.

691
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.610
My parents...

692
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:17.949
Well. Daddy was a big drinker.
and-- and my mom.

693
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.828
she was a manager at Craftway.
so. pretty crazy hours.

694
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:27.834
So you carry bloody meat around
in bags

695
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.961
to make yourself feel better?

696
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.588
-As a reminder. I guess.
-Yeah.

697
00:35:33.756 --> 00:35:36.759
That we all end up in the
cheese drawer.

698
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:39.804
Exactly.

699
00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:57.655
Hey.

700
00:35:58.406 --> 00:35:59.949
Hey.

701
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:01.909
-I won't bite. you know.
-I know.

702
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:07.790
I know. It's just. you know.
Nora's here.
And Shelby. I'm trying to--

703
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.125
Be respectful.

704
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.293
-Yeah.
-It's sweet.

705
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:13.671
You know. in-- in grief group.

706
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.798
really. they-- they recommend
that you--

707
00:36:15.798 --> 00:36:17.967
-Don't fuck your wife's friends.
-Okay.

708
00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:20.011
Yeah.

709
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:23.014
-It was a difficult time.
-Yeah.

710
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:26.809
-And now it's not?
-Look. I'm just. um...

711
00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:30.563
I'm trying to. uh--

712
00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.440
-You know. I owe it to--
-Shelby?

713
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.319
She's 25.

714
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.112
You really think you're her
last stop?

715
00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:43.659
She gets me. okay?
Yeah. She doesn't judge.

716
00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:44.994
She will. though.

717
00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:47.163
They all do. eventually.

718
00:36:47.163 --> 00:36:48.623
But not me.

719
00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.585
'Cause I was there.

720
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:55.338
and when you remember that.

721
00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:58.174
you'll be back.

722
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:02.595
Excuse-- excuse me.

723
00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:12.230
And he would just sit there
with a crossbow.

724
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.106
-He was focused on these wolves.
-Uh-huh.

725
00:37:14.106 --> 00:37:16.067
He thought they were
trying to get his rabbits.

726
00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.485
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh. God.

727
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:21.113
David. can you go get
one of those bug lanterns from
the shed?

728
00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:22.406
-Now?
-Oh. my God.

729
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.991
Before they eat us alive.
please.

730
00:37:25.368 --> 00:37:26.452
Okay.

731
00:37:26.452 --> 00:37:29.163
You're gonna have to crawl
around in there.
'cause Tom's too tall.

732
00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.248
All right.

733
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.791
Oh. God. Anyway.

734
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.126
he was a big believer in
personal punishments.

735
00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:37.004
Eye for an eye. Leviticus.
Been around forever.

736
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:39.173
Not really Jesus at his finest.
though. is it?

737
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:41.467
Yeah. I bet you never
left the coop open again.

738
00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:44.428
And you could probably
murder a chicken in your sleep.

739
00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:47.098
"Give them great meals
of beef and iron and steel.

740
00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.850
they will eat like wolves
and fight like devils."
Shakespeare.

741
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.268
I was wondering where you went.

742
00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:53.062
I thought you ran off
like a little rooster.

743
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:56.482
Shannon. I love the decoration
and the house. the interior.

744
00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:59.068
I remember it from
the one time I was invited.

745
00:38:00.403 --> 00:38:02.905
-It's okay.
-Where's Nora?

746
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.699
I thought she was with you.

747
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:08.119
-Maybe upstairs. Should I go--
-I'm sure she's fine.

748
00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:11.205
She can't have gone far.
Hopefully.

749
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:14.458
Anyway. that's my next project.
Clean out the shed. get rid of
all the--

750
00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:16.877
-Axes. crossbows. and shotguns.
-Exactly.

751
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:39.984
Jesus!

752
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.044
-Hi.
-Fuck.

753
00:38:58.044 --> 00:39:01.505
-I'm so sorry to scare you.
-Fuck.

754
00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.884
Hey. I thought it was
wireless weekend. sir.

755
00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:09.013
Oh. Yeah.

756
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.431
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

757
00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.601
-So dark in here. right?
-Yeah.

758
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.270
Yeah. Michael wanted an axe. so.

759
00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:26.030
Oh. my God.
You think they'd have killed it
by now.

760
00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:29.533
How is that deer heart. Shelby?

761
00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:30.910
No. no. no. Shelby doesn't eat--

762
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.537
Oh. I-- I just keep it to
remind me
that it was a living being.

763
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.456
Okay. That's cool.

764
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:37.708
-I don't actually hunt it.
-Well. it's very bloody.

765
00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.628
-I only buy fresh.
-Oh. that's good. So. you're--

766
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:43.714
-Honoring the animal.
-Oh. like the fish with the
eyeballs in!

767
00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:47.384
I think it's good to remember
how fleeting life is.
That at any moment...

768
00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:49.136
We could all be eaten.

769
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:54.433
Anyway. Tom. It is delicious.
What is the seasoning?

770
00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:57.686
Oh. thanks. That's. um. well.
you know...

771
00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:00.523
Shannon doesn't give me
compliments anymore.

772
00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:02.233
-Oh. my God.
-So. just salt.

773
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.860
Tom is very good with tongs.

774
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.405
That's me.
Gotta get my tongs in any way I
can.

775
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:12.701
So. Shannon. How's Maddie?
Still dancing?

776
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:14.620
Oh. yeah. she's good. She's
good.

777
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.123
Third grade.
so all. you know. girl dynamic.

778
00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.541
I can imagine.

779
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.879
-She has friends?
-Yeah. she does. Nice kids.

780
00:40:23.879 --> 00:40:25.673
No pool parties. I hope.

781
00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:28.551
No.

782
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.344
Babe. let's not?

783
00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:31.720
It's okay.

784
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.224
I guess it should be
sort of unseemly at this point.

785
00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:36.725
No one's saying that.

786
00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:39.103
Hey. can I get anybody a drink?

787
00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:43.566
Uh. yeah.
I'd like a vodka soda. light on
the soda.

788
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:45.442
I thought you were sober.

789
00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.862
-No. not right now.
-Huh.

790
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.199
-Is that okay?
-I just figured after what
happened--

791
00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:54.577
Well. we're adults. Nora.
We can have a weekend.

792
00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:56.620
Model parenting was
never really your thing anyway.

793
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.872
-was it?
-What does that mean?

794
00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:00.374
Getting drunk at a
four-year-old's
birthday party in the park?

795
00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:02.460
You said I was fine.
You said nobody noticed.

796
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.171
It was 9:00 in the morning.
Kate. You threw up
under the monkey bars.

797
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.631
-We had to rope them off.
-I had food poisoning!

798
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.425
You had booze in a sippy cup.

799
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:13.179
-And yet somehow. your kid is
still alive.
-Oh. Nora--

800
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:17.308
-We think about Hannah all the
time. Nora.
-Do you? Sleep at night?

801
00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:21.270
We haven't forgotten. Obviously
it's different for you and for
Michael.

802
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.105
-How is Maddie's knee?
-Sorry?

803
00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:26.358
I remember she scraped it that
day. but I don't know
if she actually drew blood.

804
00:41:26.358 --> 00:41:29.236
I do remember all the adults
were running around
looking for a band-aid.

805
00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:32.823
-Babe. let's go for a walk.
Come on.
-Maddie was six. She fell.

806
00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:35.784
-So we were making sure that
she--
-Had the right fucking band-aid.

807
00:41:35.784 --> 00:41:37.828
We weren't in the pool. Nora.

808
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.581
We weren't watching her.
She wasn't our kid.

809
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:42.374
-She was with Michael.
-Oh. boy. Here we go.

810
00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:44.251
-I'm sorry. but it's true.
-It is true.

811
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:45.753
But it takes a village. doesn't
it?

812
00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:48.088
Nora. it's okay to be mad.

813
00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:51.550
It's okay to wanna
poop your insides out on the
floor.

814
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.261
-That's what Jesus is for.
-Shelby. it's okay. I got-- I
got this.

815
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:55.512
Oh. now he's got this.

816
00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:58.557
Trust me. honey.
Multitasking was never his
strong suit.

817
00:41:58.557 --> 00:42:00.976
-Don't do this. Nora.
-Especially when a woman is
involved.

818
00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:03.145
He suddenly has
the mental capacity of a pizza
box.

819
00:42:03.145 --> 00:42:06.273
-Jesus. Nora. Can we just--
-Hey. Lily. You wanna chime in
here?

820
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:09.693
-Do a little bit of your
therapy?
-Uh. no. This is Nora's journey.

821
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.528
-We don't interfere.
-Oh. nice.

822
00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:14.156
So. shit-filled fan.
your work here is done?

823
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:16.242
Any time you wanna
start identifying your triggers.

824
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:19.370
Oh. can I go first?
Because I don't know if sleeping
with my husband counts.

825
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.330
but that's always been
really triggering for me.

826
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:22.748
-Damn it.
-Oh. God. barely.

827
00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:24.708
-What do you mean. barely?
-You slept with David?

828
00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:27.086
I'm a sexual person.
You know I have different
boundaries.

829
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:29.213
-You don't have any boundaries.
-He's not my husband.

830
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.215
-Well. you were my friend.
-Oh. was I?

831
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.217
'Cause you disappeared. All of
you did.

832
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.302
Nobody returned my calls.
except David.

833
00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:37.012
Yeah. I'm sure he did.

834
00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.181
-And Michael.
-Oh. did he?

835
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:42.393
"Faithful are the wounds of a
friend. Profound are the kisses
of an enemy."

836
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:45.646
-That one's a proverb.
-Yes. Thank you. that's so
helpful.

837
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:48.732
We just have to hold on
until Jesus calls you home.

838
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:51.402
-Shelby.
-Not that we should be in a
rush.

839
00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.195
Oh. I'm not. But I'll get there.

840
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.828
-Well. on that note. I think
I'll--
-Yes. please. Me too.

841
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:04.665
Oh. God. I'm so sorry. I get so
dark
these days. It's the medication.

842
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:07.668
-We're still tinkering with the
dosage.
-It's okay. It's okay.

843
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.837
-I'm sorry. Katie.
-No. no. It's fine. it's fine.

844
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:12.298
-Totally. I think I just--
-You need a drink.

845
00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:16.427
I do need one! Shannon. Anyone
else?

846
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:19.763
I'll come.
Maybe I should have one after
all.

847
00:43:27.062 --> 00:43:28.564
I'm not sure...

848
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.192
that I can do this.

849
00:43:34.028 --> 00:43:35.612
She's in a lot of pain.

850
00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:39.074
Aren't we all? I mean. as a
species.

851
00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:41.493
You were there too? That day?

852
00:43:41.493 --> 00:43:43.537
Yeah. I mean. briefly.

853
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.206
It was...

854
00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:48.625
it was a lot.

855
00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:51.211
It must be really hard for you.

856
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.923
It's amazing y'all stayed
friends.

857
00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:03.932
White. red? Weren't you rosé?

858
00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:06.894
-I was vodka tonic.
-Oh. that's right!

859
00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.188
-Can I make you one?
-I should probably just have
water.

860
00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:11.148
I gotta take my meds.
Doesn't really mix well.

861
00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:13.859
Oh. duh. Of course. been there.

862
00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:16.445
Yeah. Antipsychotics. mostly.

863
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:19.448
Also horse tranquilizers
in case of emergency.

864
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:20.991
Instant blackout.

865
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.744
Oh. wow. Really?
Since they-- I mean. I'd take
anything.

866
00:44:23.744 --> 00:44:26.705
You would. Remember how
scared I used to be of needles?

867
00:44:26.705 --> 00:44:31.043
Oh. my God. Yes. the flu shot!
Passing out at the drugstore.

868
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:34.046
You took out that. like.
entire display case of nasal
spray.

869
00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:37.049
I did.
God. I could be a heroin addict
now.

870
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:39.760
-I don't even flinch.
-So. is it helping?

871
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.303
Here and there.

872
00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:44.306
-I can't imagine.
-No. you can't.

873
00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:47.518
Remember in New York we used
to buy such cheap bottles of
wine

874
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.686
that we'd have to break the
corks
to get them open?

875
00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:52.564
Oh. God. We had no standards.
Like. none.

876
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:55.442
-Three-buck chardie!
-Oh. how did we survive?

877
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:59.279
Nothing in our stomachs.
Mild eating disorders. No
hydration.

878
00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:00.864
I think I shit in the bathtub
once.

879
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.658
I'm not totally sure. but...

880
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:03.909
-You did.
-Oh. yeah.

881
00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:07.663
-Oh. yeah. those were the days.
-Yeah.

882
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:11.875
To living above 96th Street.

883
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:15.546
Oh. God. Well. that's what I get
for buying wine from the
mini-mart.

884
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.757
-Well. salud.
-Nostrovia.

885
00:45:31.603 --> 00:45:32.688
Jealousy.

886
00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.606
Bitterness.

887
00:45:34.606 --> 00:45:35.858
Envy.

888
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:37.943
-Fear.
-Time's up.

889
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:39.653
Jesus. Rage.

890
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:43.031
Rage. okay. Yeah. nice. subtle.

891
00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:46.118
-Dave and Katie. you're up.
-Oh. God. okay.

892
00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:48.454
-Oh. I don't think I can do it.
-You got it!

893
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:50.247
-Ah. thank you.
-No.

894
00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:52.416
They still haven't figured out
that black lung thing.

895
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.793
-Vitamin E or rat feces or
whatever.
-Shannon...

896
00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:56.920
-We have kids at home.
-Oh. busted.

897
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.423
You know what's so funny?
When you're not a mother
anymore.

898
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:02.593
no one cares what you do with
your body. It's like you could
skydive into work

899
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.554
they'd be like. "Well. there are
seven billion people on the
planet.

900
00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:07.347
-One less won't make a
difference."
-Babe.

901
00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:09.766
There's your trauma talking.
This is good.

902
00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:13.353
It's like when you're not tied
to sustaining the species
anymore.

903
00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:15.147
you're taxing the system. you
know?

904
00:46:15.147 --> 00:46:16.440
I say once a mother.
always a mother.

905
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.774
Okay. sorry. Can we do this now?

906
00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:19.276
I don't like standing
while I drink.

907
00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.777
Yes. Begin.

908
00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:27.618
You're contributing to
the overall health of humanity.

909
00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:30.871
putting love into this world
to help it hum at a higher
frequency.

910
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:32.831
I wish I could believe that.

911
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:34.708
You manifest yourself
as kindness in all you do.

912
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:36.585
-Oh. that's nice.
-Psalm 145.

913
00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:39.546
-Desire!
-God. yes. Thank you.

914
00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:42.549
No. you cannot guess one
another's!
This is a team thing.

915
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:45.636
-Oh.
-It-- it's really more about
God than you.

916
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.179
but something to aspire to.

917
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:49.306
Okay. so now. why do we--
I'm totally just curious.

918
00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:52.392
Why do we need a quote from
Jesus or whatever
to illustrate the point?

919
00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:55.604
I mean. can't we just be good
people without needing. like. a
magical unicorn

920
00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:57.731
-to show us how?
-Unicorns aren't real.

921
00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:59.900
-They aren't?
-Well. no offense. but neither
is Jesus.

922
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.487
I don't need a talking horse or
a mythical sheep farmer
to tell me what to think.

923
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:07.115
I can just kinda guess. right?
I mean. if I'm a relatively
good person.

924
00:47:07.115 --> 00:47:09.034
Are we. though? Are we good
people?

925
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:11.995
-Disdain.
-Yeah! Whoop. whoop!

926
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.039
Oh. I give up. You two.

927
00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:15.541
-Oh.
-Fucker!

928
00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:20.337
Cold in here. dudes.
Start that fire now?

929
00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:21.713
Oh. right. We just need some
more wood.

930
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:24.049
-I'll go.
-Oh. no. we. uh--

931
00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:27.052
No. we don't chop down the trees
around here. We buy our wood in
bulk.

932
00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:31.306
-Oh. man. Uh. babe. about that.
-You didn't buy wood.

933
00:47:31.306 --> 00:47:33.600
-There's a forest right out
there.
-It's landscaping.

934
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.271
You don't pay a landscaper 20
grand and then just chop it down
a few weeks later.

935
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:40.357
-Come on.
-No worries. Yeah. no. I'll go.

936
00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:42.609
-I'm-- I'm a Viking.
-Chop at a neighbor's.

937
00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:44.403
-Yeah.
-I'll come.

938
00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:46.280
No. no. no. No. it's fine. I
got it.

939
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.781
But I want to.

940
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.994
I'm all right. Go ahead.

941
00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.996
See? She's all right.

942
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:56.331
-Right. Lily?
-What?

943
00:47:56.331 --> 00:47:58.041
Don't decapitate any rabbits.

944
00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:01.545
Wolves. not rabbits.
Why would you decapitate a
rabbit?

945
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.381
-One less rabbit. I guess.
-Good luck!

946
00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.383
One last supper for the wolf.

947
00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:39.458
So. are we supposed to just...

948
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:42.919
-be chopping down trees. or...
-I think just wood that's
already--

949
00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.046
-Died?
-Yeah.

950
00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:46.590
-Waiting to be hauled away?
-Exactly.

951
00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:50.510
A Viking. huh?

952
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.137
Yeah. well. you know.

953
00:48:52.137 --> 00:48:55.599
It's a new me. Fresh start.

954
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.810
With Old Norse? Does that come
in handy?

955
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.896
Yeah. well. that's. uh...

956
00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:05.525
Shelby. you know. she does
these. uh. reenactment things
on the weekend.

957
00:49:05.525 --> 00:49:08.528
-It meant a lot to her.
-Right. Of course.

958
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:13.450
I can't believe we never went
camping.

959
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:18.038
We bought that huge tent with
that. like. pop-out lounge
thing. remember?

960
00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:22.501
And we told Hannah that
if she did one whole night
in her bed on her own.

961
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:24.586
-we'd do it.
-Yeah.

962
00:49:24.586 --> 00:49:28.632
But she kept coming in. asking
questions
about cheetahs or volcanoes.

963
00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.093
-Or if trees can have babies.
-At 2:00 in the morning.

964
00:49:31.093 --> 00:49:34.054
Like clockwork. And then we'd
all have to cram into her
little tiny bed.

965
00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:36.223
Littered with stuffed animals.

966
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:40.477
Remember she had that pink
little sloth.
or whatever it was?

967
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:43.605
You just touched it
and it would light up and sing
for hours.

968
00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:47.150
Couldn't turn it off.
Had to let it play itself out.

969
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.654
-We threw it away. right?
-Yeah. neighbor's trash can.

970
00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:53.323
It was the only place far enough
where we couldn't hear it.
right?

971
00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.075
I mean. I'm sure they could.
but...

972
00:49:56.451 --> 00:50:00.330
Well. we did our sleep training
follow through. we read our
books.

973
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:05.252
We had our united front.
and... never went camping.

974
00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:08.171
So glad we stayed on message.

975
00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:12.300
She didn't die mad. you know.

976
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:19.516
Whatever thought she had
in her little head before. uh--

977
00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:23.395
-Before the panicked ones?
-Was of a loving. happy family.

978
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:27.190
If she could carry something
with her.
it would be that.

979
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.777
Does it work that way? You get
to choose your screensaver
before it all goes black?

980
00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:34.072
You do. I have to believe that
you do.

981
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:37.993
Well. I guess we'll know when
we know.

982
00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:40.829
Yeah.

983
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:45.250
That does not look sharp. that
axe.

984
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:46.877
You're really gonna have to
swing that.

985
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:51.214
-Are you saying that I can't
swing it?
-Oh. no. no.

986
00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:54.593
No. you're shockingly strong
for someone with a comp lit
degree.

987
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:56.428
Thank you so much.

988
00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:58.638
The perfect blend of Faulkner
and force.

989
00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:01.850
Well. certainly the utter and
heartbreaking stupidity of
words.

990
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.018
That. I have.

991
00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:05.437
Yeah.

992
00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:09.983
Life could have been so
different.

993
00:51:16.448 --> 00:51:17.991
Can I hold it?

994
00:51:19.367 --> 00:51:20.577
Sure.

995
00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.287
It's heavy.

996
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:24.498
Ooh. it is.

997
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:26.792
I don't know. man.

998
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.503
I'm not sure what we could chop
down.

Michael?

1006
00:52:13.004 --> 00:52:14.089
Michael?

1007
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.009
Nora?

1008
00:52:23.014 --> 00:52:24.307
Okay. Michael.

1009
00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:31.022
Lily wants to do some kind of
moon yoga with everyone. so...

1010
00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:33.608
Hi. Shelby.

1011
00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:38.864
Oh. my goodness gracious. You
scared me.

1012
00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:44.035
Oh. did you... kill something?

1013
00:52:44.035 --> 00:52:48.290
No. Oh. no. no. no. This is
just...

1014
00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:52.544
Well... yes. probably.

1015
00:52:54.212 --> 00:52:55.297
Where's Michael?

1016
00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.634
-Maybe he left?
-Sorry?

1017
00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:02.137
You parked up the road. right?

1018
00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:04.014
We didn't wanna block anyone.

1019
00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:06.182
-And Shannon said there wasn't--
-I'd go get your car.

1020
00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.894
These reunions can get so
boring.

1021
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:10.896
Probably the best time to leave.

1022
00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:19.821
His life was ruined too. you
know.

1023
00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:23.825
He thinks about Hannah every
day.

1024
00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:27.704
I'm sure. but that little part
of his brain that feels guilty?

1025
00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:31.207
That little part closes up shop.
and off he goes to work

1026
00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:33.835
or have drinks with his buddies
or have sex with someone like
you

1027
00:53:33.835 --> 00:53:36.254
who doesn't remind him
of the life he once had.

1028
00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:39.341
And he may not be whole. but...

1029
00:53:40.508 --> 00:53:42.135
he's closer than he should be.

1030
00:53:44.179 --> 00:53:46.222
So he can't be happy again?

1031
00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:50.143
-He's not allowed?
-No. he can't. She can't. So.
no. sorry.

1032
00:53:50.143 --> 00:53:53.480
-He's gonna be a father.
-He was a father.

1033
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.898
Again.

1034
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.400
He tried to tell you.

1035
00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:01.863
It was important to him that
you knew.

1036
00:54:12.707 --> 00:54:14.334
You're gonna be a great mother.

1037
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:16.503
He just won't be around to see
it.

1038
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.423
It's against God's law to take
a life.

1039
00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:24.886
Well. I guess he should've
thought of that
before he took Hannah's.

1040
00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.896
If I see Michael. I'll tell him
you left.

1041
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:38.149
You should have
an easy drive along the five.

1042
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:56.918
-Does anyone else feel sick?
-Maybe it was the meat trio.

1043
00:54:56.918 --> 00:54:58.128
Shelby said she loved it.

1044
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:02.507
Well.
Shelby puts animal hearts in
plastic bags.

1045
00:55:02.507 --> 00:55:04.300
She's not exactly a food critic.

1046
00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:08.138
-Oh. my God.
-Oh. shit. Kate.

1047
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:10.140
-I'm so sorry. I don't even--
-Did she just...

1048
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.975
Oh. shit. Hey. do you have a
towel. or...

1049
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.269
-I got-- I got a napkin.
-Tom. hose!

1050
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:15.895
Oh. all right. On it. on it.

1051
00:55:15.895 --> 00:55:18.773
No one's gonna wanna do trust
falls now.
Just take this.

1052
00:55:18.773 --> 00:55:20.942
Hey. you okay?
You want a water?

1053
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:23.653
No. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just...

1054
00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.655
Oh. shit.

1055
00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:29.701
-What?
-Your. uh. your nose. You're
bleeding.

1056
00:55:31.244 --> 00:55:37.459
Oh. God. Oh. my God. gross!
Why is everything so gross?

1057
00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:38.668
Oh. my God.

1058
00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:51.097
Come on. where is this?

1059
00:55:51.097 --> 00:55:53.808
-You got a body in there?
-Oh! Shit.

1060
00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:57.562
You scared-- Oh. gosh. Kate got
sick.

1061
00:55:57.562 --> 00:56:00.106
-Oh. not surprising.
-Yeah.

1062
00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:01.941
Hey. is that blood? Oh. shit.

1063
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:08.573
Oh!
Someone else didn't do wireless
weekend.

1064
00:56:08.573 --> 00:56:11.701
Yeah. that's Shannon's for
emergencies.
But. um...

1065
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.453
-Oh.
-Yeah. we gotta get that.

1066
00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:15.205
Excuse. Come on. watch your
step here.

1067
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.290
Oh. I used to love this song.

1068
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.043
Remember that fundraiser
the first year at White Oaks?

1069
00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:23.797
Shannon made that embarrassing
speech about parenting
and Kate blacked out.

1070
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.507
I danced with Michael to this.

1071
00:56:31.304 --> 00:56:33.348
Weird. Is someone in the hot
tub?

1072
00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:35.183
No. It's broken. actually.

1073
00:56:39.813 --> 00:56:43.316
-I think we missed it.
-Oh. what the hell?

1074
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:45.235
Gosh. that water looks warm.

1075
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:48.488
I'd get in.
but I don't know if I'd get out.

1076
00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.783
I just-- I'll get it.

1077
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.128
Can you see okay?

1078
00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:04.379
Or do you want me
to turn on the---

1079
00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.589
No. no. no. no!
Don't touch that!

1080
00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:13.096
Do you know that voltage
just loves saltwater?

1081
00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:15.348
Which is in our bodies.

1082
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:19.185
so it really takes a shortcut
through the human form to get.

1083
00:57:19.185 --> 00:57:21.020
I don't know. wherever it is
it's going.

1084
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.398
Apparently it saves time. Who
knew?

1085
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:26.526
Anyway. I would help you.
but I don't have rubber boots
on.

1086
00:57:26.526 --> 00:57:29.529
and I was told that you never
touch a downed power line.

1087
00:57:29.529 --> 00:57:31.865
You know what?
I should probably turn this off

1088
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:33.867
so that no one makes the same
mistake.

1089
00:57:37.495 --> 00:57:38.705
It's a shame.

1090
00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:42.709
You really were
the nicest one in the bunch.

1091
00:57:43.585 --> 00:57:47.881
But as Lily says.
you can't use old wood to make
a new nest.

1092
00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:49.132
Tom?

1093
00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:53.803
Especially with so many hawks
around.

1094
00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:57.265
-You out here?
-He is never where I need him
to be.

1095
00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:59.434
Oh. shit.

1096
00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:03.146
God. Tom! What are you doing?

1097
00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.440
You know that we are not
supposed to be using--

1098
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.984
I called the electrician weeks
ago
and he still hasn't--

1099
00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:11.237
Tom?

1100
00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:14.407
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh.
God!

1101
00:58:14.407 --> 00:58:17.827
-Tom? Tom. Tom! Tom!
-Oh. God! Oh. God! Oh. God!

1102
00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:19.412
-Oh. God!
-Hey. hey!

1103
00:58:19.412 --> 00:58:21.497
Do the thing!
The thing with the thing. the
mouth thing!

1104
00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.208
-Wake up!
-We gotta take him in.

1105
00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:24.792
What do you mean. in?
In. like. a hospital?

1106
00:58:24.792 --> 00:58:26.419
-I mean. like--
-I don't know!

1107
00:58:26.419 --> 00:58:28.755
-Tom. Tom!
-Pull him out!

1108
00:58:32.258 --> 00:58:34.802
All right. buddy.
Keys. keys! Who's got the keys?

1109
00:58:34.802 --> 00:58:37.347
Tom has them. They're in that
pocket
right there. right there.

1110
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.390
-Got it.
-Okay. Okay.

1111
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:41.351
-Kate. please stay here.
-What the fuck? No!

1112
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.853
Michael is missing.
and Shelby and Nora might come
back.

1113
00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.104
No. I don't care. I don't give
a shit.

1114
00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:47.523
I'm not staying here
to get eaten
by some fucking forest monster!

1115
00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.901
There's no forest monster!
Jesus. Kate!

1116
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:55.865
Whoa. shit! Open the door.
open the door. open the fucking
door!

1117
00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.917
-Oh my God. I feel sick.
-Don't you fucking vomit on Tom.

1118
00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:11.130
Uh. Hey. uh. Nora? Uh. we gotta
go.

1119
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:15.551
-Tom's in. uh-- in a kind of a
bad way--
-Oh. Jesus Christ.

1120
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:18.596
Hey. hon? Do you mind
moving the fuck out of the way?

1121
00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:20.556
We'll be right back. Okay.
thanks.

1122
00:59:21.849 --> 00:59:23.726
-Oh. my God! Okay. okay.
-Go. go. go!

1123
00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:26.646
-You've just gotta go.
-I can't just run her over!

1124
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.648
You are an exec. David!
You can run her over!

1125
00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:31.067
Oh God. I gotta get inside.
I gotta throw up.

1126
00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:34.320
On the count of three.
we go inside. we leave the body.

1127
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.947
It's not "the body." it's Tom.

1128
00:59:35.947 --> 00:59:38.116
Oh. God. I think I shit myself.

1129
00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:39.200
And go!

1130
00:59:40.368 --> 00:59:41.703
Oh. no.

1131
00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:46.207
Oh. baby. I'm sorry.
I love you. I'll be right back.
Holy shit.

1132
00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:49.210
-Oh. God. I'm so sorry!
-Leave the body! Now!

1133
00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.671
-Jesus!
-Oh. my God!

1134
00:59:51.671 --> 00:59:53.923
Oh. my God!

1135
00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:55.591
-Oh!
-Oh. my God!

1136
00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:56.843
There y'all are.

1137
00:59:59.387 --> 01:00:02.223
Gosh. I. um...
Well. I ate all of the gummies.

1138
01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:04.976
and I think they were the happy
ones.
'cause I am jacked!

1139
01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.061
-Who wants a drink?
-I need water.

1140
01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:08.813
Oh. it's not exactly wat-- Okay.

1141
01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:10.690
-Nora's trying to kill us with
an axe.
-What?

1142
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.026
And Tommy's unconscious.
Or dead. He's probably dead.

1143
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.695
Oh. my God. heart attack?
That's why I do intermittent
fasting.

1144
01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.697
-Honestly. it does make a
difference.
-No. Jesus!

1145
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.240
He was electrocuted
in the fucking hot tub!

1146
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.533
Oh. I thought they fixed that.

1147
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:23.119
-No. no. The electrician never
came.
-Oh. that's not surprising.

1148
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.829
We need an ambulance. Or a
motorboat.

1149
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:27.540
The sea pirate that dropped you
off.
do you have his number?

1150
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.917
Why would I get his number?
He was. like. 80.

1151
01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:37.175
Oh. what the fuck? Where's my
phone?
It was charging in the bathroom.

1152
01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:40.136
Oh it's. um-- it's in the shed
in-- in a garden box by the
gnomes.

1153
01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.764
Jesus! Shit.

1154
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:45.224
Well. wireless weekend. David!
We agreed.

1155
01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.316
-Get the fuck away!
-Oh. shit. shit. shit. shit!

1156
01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.442
Please. help me.

1157
01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:56.819
Oh. my God. Michael! Oh. my God.

1158
01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.072
Oh. my God. Oh. my God!

1159
01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.574
Shelby left. I don't understand.

1160
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.911
-What did you say to her. Lily?
-Nothing.

1161
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.746
I was about to be a father.

1162
01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:13.961
Not with me.

1163
01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:16.005
-Lily!
-Oh. my God. Get him out.

1164
01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.548
-Get him out!
-We could give her Lily!

1165
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:20.510
If we have to give her someone.
She's pretty high. she might
not notice.

1166
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.011
We're not giving her anyone!

1167
01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.848
-Oh. God!
-What is happening?

1168
01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.392
Okay. get to the kitchen!

1169
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.435
-Why the kitchen?
-Go. go. go. go!

1170
01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:30.937
We gotta go. we have to go.

1171
01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:34.524
Don't worry. everything is fine.
I'm gonna lock the door.

1172
01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.692
This is not a big deal.

1173
01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.991
Nora.
I want you to take a deep
breath. okay?

1174
01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.785
Let's try and find our baseline.

1175
01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.293
You know. sometimes. um. certain
phrases can trigger a sense of
calm.

1176
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.593
I need a bathroom.

1177
01:02:02.593 --> 01:02:07.432
Okay. look. I wasn't gonna say
anything 'cause we don't like
to interfere.

1178
01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:09.392
but none of this is real.

1179
01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.937
-What?
-Um. it's all a sim-- a
simulation.

1180
01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:16.232
-It's a part of her program.
-My colon's unwinding.

1181
01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:19.902
Okay. so ClearMind
is all about finding a safe
space

1182
01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.905
to release aggression
in a controlled setting.

1183
01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:25.283
Revenge fantasies.
but with a therapeutic goal.

1184
01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.869
-What the fuck?
-It's like death. but with a
safety net.

1185
01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.537
So you're all fine.

1186
01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.289
I don't feel fine!

1187
01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.291
You know.
the session is taking longer
than usual.

1188
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:36.627
and I am having trouble with
host mode.

1189
01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:40.173
And I see-- You know. I am sort
of in somewhat of
a new territory myself.

1190
01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.508
-Oh. okay.
-Oh. God.

1191
01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:45.845
Am I bleeding? I'm bleeding.
aren't I?

1192
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:49.807
You know what? I think that if
someone took responsibility
for what happened.

1193
01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.309
that she would really wrap it
up.

1194
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.768
And you were there.
and you were there.

1195
01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:55.313
-And you were there!
-Yeah. for. like. 15 minutes.

1196
01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.689
You were flirting with
her husband in the pool.

1197
01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:58.399
Well.
we obviously remember things
differently.

1198
01:02:58.399 --> 01:02:59.775
Not differently. Perfectly.

1199
01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:02.278
I asked Nora for a bowl 'cause
I wanted to help her with
crudités.

1200
01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.447
and she assumed that Michael
was in the pool with Hannah.

1201
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.032
but Michael was in the pool
with you.

1202
01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.451
Because you cannot stand
to go for more than five minutes

1203
01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.411
without feeling desired
by somebody else's husband.

1204
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:13.414
Oh. yes. please let me fuck
your sad. paunchy husbands.

1205
01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:16.792
-Stop it.
-There were 40 other people at
that party.

1206
01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:20.087
Watching somebody else's kid
is not my job.

1207
01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:21.839
She's right.

1208
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.257
It was Michael's job.

1209
01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:26.302
Oh. my God.
It's a gun now. She's got a gun.

1210
01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.803
Nora. put down the gun.

1211
01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:30.640
And your job. and your job.

1212
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.308
And really. Lily. your job.

1213
01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.937
You're right. Nora.
Our village has failed you.

1214
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.271
You're bleeding.

1215
01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:41.108
-Make it stop.
-Maybe it's the Midazolam.

1216
01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:44.028
I tripled the dose since
you always had such a high
tolerance.

1217
01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:48.032
That's right. This is all so
that you can tell the village
how you feel.

1218
01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:50.201
Your anger. but with your words.

1219
01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:51.536
Oh. God. Kate! Kate!

1220
01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.955
I'm fine. I think I'm fine.
I just have to rest here.

1221
01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.624
-Oh my God. David!
-Nora. come on.

1222
01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:57.875
I want you to sit down.

1223
01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.795
It's not a multiplayer game.
Lily. So it's not up to you.

1224
01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:03.172
Well. we always been a team.
remember?

1225
01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.591
We're fuckin' kinder-buddies.

1226
01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.261
-Line leader.
-Super snooper.

1227
01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.430
-Yeah.
-Yes. you've always had my back.

1228
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.891
Even when I shoplifted at
Lyman's
in eighth grade.

1229
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:16.310
You got candy bars.
I got community service.

1230
01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.563
-I know.
-Oh. God. I'm fine.

1231
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.524
Remember junior prom. when you
got bored
and you ditched your date?

1232
01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.734
-And you fucked him.
-And you're welcome.

1233
01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.574
You're right. Lily.
When shit goes down. you're
always there.

1234
01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.284
Finally!

1235
01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:00.104
We're sorry.

1236
01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:02.481
We just--

1237
01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:05.860
Seeing you. it was so hard.

1238
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.528
But we will never forget.

1239
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.281
We will never forget Hannah.

1240
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:13.075
It's too late. Shannon.

1241
01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:16.245
For Kate. Michael. Tom.

1242
01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.371
For you too.

1243
01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:19.290
What the fuck? Lily. do
something.

1244
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.294
-Oh. she can't. I've disabled
host mode.
-What?

1245
01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:26.005
It was shockingly easy.
Just a tiny button.

1246
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.716
How do you feel? Powerless?

1247
01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.052
End game. Nora. Right now.

1248
01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:35.306
Did you know that the average
human can only hold their breath
for 30.

1249
01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:38.309
maybe 60 seconds underwater
before they start to take it in?

1250
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:41.062
Even less for children. We're
so fragile.

1251
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.396
Nora. please.

1252
01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:44.065
First. you hold your breath

1253
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.858
until it feels like your brain
is on fire.

1254
01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.777
-Okay.
-Then you suck in water

1255
01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.945
and your larynx closes.

1256
01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:53.074
Once you've passed out and
your lungs are completely
collapsed.

1257
01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.117
only then the body relaxes.

1258
01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:58.871
You've stopped breathing.
but the heart still beats.

1259
01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:00.706
Seven minutes.

1260
01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:04.168
It takes seven minutes to be
officially dead.
which is actually quite long.

1261
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.754
-That sounds awful.
-Oh. I'm sure it was.

1262
01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:10.341
But it only takes two minutes
to die from a gunshot wound.

1263
01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.426
That's a strategically-placed
one.

1264
01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:14.553
And I'm not a good shot.
so yours should be slower.

1265
01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:16.138
Nora. no!

1266
01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:27.233
Tom's still really. really
quiet.
but maybe breathing.

1267
01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:31.529
I-- I can't-- I can't tell.
but the keys are gone.

1268
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.781
The tires are flat. I don't--

1269
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:35.866
We'll go to the neighbors
and they can drive us out.

1270
01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:37.576
I-- I don't know
if there really are neighbors.

1271
01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:40.204
-I mean. the map isn't really
built out.
-Bullshit. Lily!

1272
01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:43.582
A grizzled fisherman dropped
you off. and I don't care
if he's an avatar

1273
01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:46.335
or a hologram or a Russian
teenager
in his Nana's basement.

1274
01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.462
He's getting us off this
fucking lake!

1275
01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.261
-Shut up!
-Jesus. David.

1276
01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.973
I don't even know what's
happening. I don't even know
what's out there.

1277
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:07.022
Oh. fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

1278
01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:08.899
God. no. no. no!

1279
01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:18.743
Fuck! Oh. God.

1280
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.245
-I know.
-What about town?

1281
01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:23.122
Kate went through town.
That's gotta be a way out.

1282
01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:26.459
I guess it is possible.
But I-- I'm really too high for
this.

1283
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:29.503
Hey! You need to focus. Lily!

1284
01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:31.630
David. I had so many gummies.

1285
01:07:32.506 --> 01:07:33.591
Okay.

1286
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:40.014
Okay. In the game. in the sim.
you're on autosave. okay?

1287
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:42.558
So the only way to regenerate.
the only way to begin again--

1288
01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.642
What. is to die?

1289
01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:46.312
Well. I mean.
technically Nora is Player One.

1290
01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.564
so it's not game over until...

1291
01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.857
Until she is.

1292
01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:53.861
All right. we gotta do it.

1293
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.238
No! David! It's--

1294
01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.240
I mean. it's just--
it's a video game.

1295
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.533
You said it's the only way!

1296
01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:02.036
-Clean slate. level one.
-Shh!

1297
01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:04.413
Maybe-- maybe Tom's still alive.

1298
01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:07.875
Maybe Kate's still alive. huh?
Maybe even the Jesus freak.

1299
01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.419
-Oh. I don't even know if she's
real.
-What?

1300
01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.088
She might be a real version
of a fake version of a real one.

1301
01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.882
She's from the Holy Roller
Renegades.

1302
01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.425
She came with the hot tub
and shooting range.

1303
01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:20.721
-Oh. Jesus Christ.
-Oh. he's the final boss in
that one.

1304
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:24.517
And it gets so dark. David.
but it is popular with the
church kids.

1305
01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:29.814
Well. I know what we gotta do.

1306
01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:33.818
Go get Player One.

1307
01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.032
Oh. no.

1308
01:08:41.534 --> 01:08:44.537
Maybe Shannon let her out.

1309
01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:50.417
Hey. Ka-- Hey. Kate? Kate. Hey.
hon.

1310
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:54.964
She's-- she's probably sleeping.

1311
01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:58.968
Um. do you wanna help me
move her body to the couch.
or...

1312
01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.971
This is fucked up. man.

1313
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.557
I need something stronger.

1314
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.850
Where are you going?

1315
01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:07.893
I'm taking a break.

1316
01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:10.354
Well. that's not really an
option for you.
You're an NPC.

1317
01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.356
And if anybody's
gonna be taking a break...

1318
01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:13.941
Be my guest.

1319
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.901
Well. you need to stay here
and stand guard.

1320
01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.278
Stand guard over what?

1321
01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.990
-Your dead wife.
-I'm pretty sure she's sleeping.

1322
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.492
You know. you really shouldn't
be vaping.
You heard Shannon.

1323
01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.245
-I'm not Tom!
-Well. apparently there's
studies!

1324
01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:28.998
Look where it got him.
Dead in the fuckin' hot tub!

1325
01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:31.834
I'm gonna smoke some rat shit
and vitamin E.

1326
01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:36.797
Oh. God.

1327
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:42.094
Hey. uh Bob.
This is Lily from over on the
third floor.

1328
01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:45.723
and. um. I was just wondering
if maybe...

1329
01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.559
I don't know. I'm having trouble
reaching. uh. one of my
technicians.

1330
01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:51.937
and you know we're doing beta
testing
over at ClearMind. so. um. well.

1331
01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:54.648
I-- I was just thinking that
maybe
you could pop down there

1332
01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:56.942
and see if the system's
still on or needs a reboot.

1333
01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.360
It is urgent.

1334
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.738
I've been locked out of host
mode
by one of the--

1335
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.698
If you could just call me back.
Hello?

1336
01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:20.049
Fuck. Toddler caps. Open.

1337
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.425
That was Grandpa's.
He wouldn't want you touching
it.

1338
01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.470
Well. then maybe
you should have emptied out the
shed.

1339
01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:22.027
Okay. You don't have to do
this. Nora. It's not gonna bring
Hannah back.

1340
01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:24.863
-You think I don't know that?
-Okay. well. then let's sit down

1341
01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:26.699
and you can tell me everything.

1342
01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.201
We could do like the third
grade.

1343
01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:31.036
-We could have a pillow circle.
-Boring.

1344
01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.455
I don't know what
Lily's been telling you--

1345
01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:36.250
That you can't use old wood
to build a new nest.

1346
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.044
-So time for the wood chipper.
-Oh. my God!

1347
01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:41.755
Metaphorically. I don't think
they really have one on this
level.

1348
01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:44.091
Nora. please.
You need help. You need--

1349
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:46.218
you need a therapist.
A real one.

1350
01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:49.430
This is therapy.
It's what healing looks like.
Right. Lily?

1351
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:54.226
-That's weird. Where'd she go?
-I just assumed...

1352
01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:56.228
I mean. isn't she dead?

1353
01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.230
No. Not dead.

1354
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.274
-Not yet.
-There you are.

1355
01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.193
I tried to get a hold of
somebody at the office.
but there's nobody there.

1356
01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.946
So we're just gonna-- we're--
we're just gonna ride this one
out.

1357
01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:08.907
And Bob. he's not gonna be back
until Tuesday around 9:00.

1358
01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.743
-I killed Michael.
-Metaphorically.

1359
01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.454
Actually. But I felt calm.
Serene. almost.

1360
01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.457
I gotta say. your cue
absorption.
it is quite impressive.

1361
01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.333
-Unbelievable.
-Isn't it?

1362
01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:21.086
They say it risks
deteriorating human connection.

1363
01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:23.422
but I think the simality is
incredible.

1364
01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.549
Like life. only more so.

1365
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.762
Oh. shit!

1366
01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.017
I'm confused. Does that-- does
it hurt?

1367
01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:37.811
Of course it fucking hurts!
What the fuck?

1368
01:12:37.811 --> 01:12:40.064
It's all about
controlling your startle reflex.

1369
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.775
Exposure without the excitement.
I feel nothing.

1370
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:46.320
There's really-- Oh. God!
Blood. blood.
Really. really bleeding.

1371
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.032
It's so vivid. right? You'd
love it.
Shannon. The colors really pop.

1372
01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:53.786
Please. somebody help me.
I need an ambulance. Please!

1373
01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.580
Oh. I think I'd have to level
up for that.
and I'm not ready.

1374
01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.626
I need a hos-- hospital.

1375
01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.715
Nora. what is this? What are
you doing?

1376
01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.009
Oh. I had a memory restore.

1377
01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:10.636
Host mode. I guess.

1378
01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.679
Of Michael in the pool that day.

1379
01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:16.475
It was you he was talking to.

1380
01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.394
I was looking at you
because I wasn't sure.

1381
01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:21.188
And that moment I took

1382
01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:24.691
to figure out if it was my old
friend

1383
01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:28.695
keeping my husband
from watching our child--

1384
01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:32.783
Because. I don't know.
you were bored or it was a
challenge.

1385
01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:35.035
or because I was happy and you
were sad.

1386
01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:39.206
or whatever it is that
really fucked-up people feel
when they want what you have--

1387
01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:42.835
that moment of indecision. of
trust...

1388
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:48.006
it cost me-- well. it cost us...

1389
01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:51.510
Hannah.

1390
01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:53.929
Everything.

1391
01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:59.893
Nora. the mind reconfigures.

1392
01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:02.229
No wonder you felt so guilty!

1393
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.314
Anyway.
I really hope that you get your
hours

1394
01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:07.067
-or your certification or
whatever.
-Don't do this.

1395
01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.611
Nora. you-- you'll lose
everything.

1396
01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:14.241
You'll lose memories you-- you
love.
memories you need.

1397
01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:18.620
Oh. like the one of my body
hitting the pavement?

1398
01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.373
Of cards piling up at our door?

1399
01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:25.419
What about memory-- memories
of who Hannah was?

1400
01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.462
Who you were?

1401
01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:30.132
What does it matter who I was?

1402
01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:34.261
I'm wiping the slate clean.
Lily.

1403
01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.888
For all of us.

1404
01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:43.770
No!

1405
01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:51.403
Stop!

1406
01:15:23.393 --> 01:15:26.146
What the fuck. Gary?
You can't answer the fucking
phone?

1407
01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:28.857
-I was in the bathroom! You
seemed fine.
-Oh. really?

1408
01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:31.151
Like a triple homicide
was a great time to take a piss?

1409
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.403
Sorry. you know.
I was monitoring the cortisol
emissions

1410
01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.405
-and not the kill rate.
-Yeah. not the kill rate.

1411
01:15:35.405 --> 01:15:37.699
Jesus Christ. I know.
I could've murdered 'em myself.

1412
01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:44.081
Oh. my God. Nora. So vivid.

1413
01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:45.707
You did not need to be there.

1414
01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:48.043
Well. you didn't have to
shoot me with a crossbow.

1415
01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.127
Or make me that high.

1416
01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.505
Or that overtly sexual.
Is that what you think of me?

1417
01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.383
-Did you sleep with Michael?
-Oh. come on.

1418
01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.760
Well. you seemed pretty
comfortable
by the barbecue.

1419
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.971
Uh. girl. that's all your brain.

1420
01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.515
Jesus. where were you even
hiding?
Underneath the stairs?

1421
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.267
That's not important.

1422
01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:06.311
-Well. you went 30 minutes over.
-I thought you were never gonna
wrap up.

1423
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:09.439
I wanted to see if it made a
difference
to hear from everyone.

1424
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.733
Yeah. maybe on your co-pay.
I don't think your insurance

1425
01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:14.444
-is gonna pay for a double
session.
-What about the memory restore?

1426
01:16:14.444 --> 01:16:16.738
-What do we say about memory?
-It's the enemy.

1427
01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.490
But it's all good. okay?

1428
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.076
It is about the heart count.
not the head count.

1429
01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:24.538
and it's just a bunch of 3D
ultrasound images gathering in
space.

1430
01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.748
-For now.
-Yeah. for now.

1431
01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:30.043
Girl. you did not kill Tom
first!

1432
01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:31.628
-I wanted to kill Michael.
-Mm-hmm.

1433
01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.922
-But I let the girlfriend go.
-Yes. you did.

1434
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.924
-I almost didn't.
-I was like. "You go!"

1435
01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:39.219
-That was. like. next level.
-I mean. it's literally the
next level.

1436
01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:40.554
And we are gonna get there.

1437
01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:43.432
Gary. let's hook her up to the
bird cams and get a baseline
before we sign off.

1438
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.599
-Okay.
-Okay.

1439
01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:47.436
All right.

1440
01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:49.813
Okay.

1441
01:16:49.813 --> 01:16:52.232
Okay. girl. let's put on those
wings.

1442
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:55.986
The nest.

1443
01:16:57.487 --> 01:16:59.281
-It's gone.
-Yeah. it fell.

1444
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.199
You were in the game.
so I didn't wanna--

1445
01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:03.702
But you know what was in there?
A hawk with its eyes pecked out.

1446
01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:06.038
-Oh. God.
-Yeah. I don't know if the
other hawks

1447
01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.874
got mad at him
or the bird was just over his
shit. but...

1448
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.168
dead hawk.

1449
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:13.378
Okay.
Let's just be glad you're not a
bird.

1450
01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:16.048
So. what do you say?
You like Tuesday at 3:00?

1451
01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.758
Oh. I'm not gonna need Tuesday.

1452
01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:21.511
I'm ready to drop the nest.
kill a hawk. and move on.

1453
01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:23.263
Well. I think you're just
exhausted.

1454
01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:25.557
-It was a big day.
-They're all big days.

1455
01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:27.643
Gary? Can I get my things?

1456
01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:30.771
-Lily?
-Yeah?

1457
01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:35.067
I am so sorry. But thank you.

1458
01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.569
-Thank you.
-What are you doing?

1459
01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:40.530
Hey. what are you-- Please
don't.
What are you doing?

1460
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:43.200
I'm really sorry. Lily.
that you're not gonna get your
hours.

1461
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:48.497
Are you kidding me?
Nora. don't do this. Please
don't do this.

1462
01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.499
You know what. this is just
like you.

1463
01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.293
This is just like you.
that I get something for me.
something for me.

1464
01:17:53.293 --> 01:17:56.630
Maybe I want a fresh start.
You drag me down like a fucking
anchor.

1465
01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:01.218
Hey! You're never gonna kill a
hawk. Nora.

1466
01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.594
It's just not in your nature.

1467
01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:05.347
You're just a sad little bird
in a borrowed nest.

1468
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.182
just waiting for the wind to
blow.

1469
01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.524
Maybe it's time to make it mine.

1470
01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.712
Uh. what's the Wi-Fi password?

1471
01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.005
Daddy. look!

1472
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:40.108
What is it? What happened?

1473
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:43.528
Somebody call 911!

1474
01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:24.736
Oh. my God.

1475
01:20:30.116 --> 01:20:35.539
Oh. my God. Nora.
Jesus. I didn't even see you
there.

1476
01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:39.376
Fuck. Are you... okay? You're
here.

1477
01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.878
I was lost. but I found it.

1478
01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:46.299
Oh. okay. Oh.
Oh. fuck. okay. Uh. Shannon?

1479
01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:48.426

1480
01:20:48.426 --> 01:20:53.390
Hi! Oh. wow. Come. sit.

1481
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.809
Were you-- Where did you--
We didn't even know you were
coming.

1482
01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:57.936
-I didn't want anyone making a
fuss.
-Can I take that?

1483
01:20:57.936 --> 01:20:59.813
Oh. it's not heavy.

1484
01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:03.316
-Uh. did you bring clothes?
-I'm not staying.

1485
01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:05.610
Oh. don't be ridiculous.
Of course you're staying.

1486
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.029
-Is Lily here?
-Uh...

1487
01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:11.491
Nora. Uh. when did--
I didn't know--

1488
01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:14.077
Um. I'm so--
so glad you're here.

1489
01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:16.037
Yeah. she was lost. apparently.

1490
01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:20.750
-Can I take that for you?
-Oh. no. I thought I'd chop
some firewood.

1491
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:24.754
Oh. we-- we don't
cut the trees down around here.

1492
01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:28.216
-No. We-- we buy our wood--
-In bulk. I heard.

1493
01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.343
But Tom might have forgotten.
right?

1494
01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:33.638
Right. Yeah. Yeah. sure.

1495
01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.225
-Let me get you a drink.
-Oh. I'm not staying.

1496
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:42.564
Of course you are. Don't be
absurd.
Don't-- Uh. Michael?

1497
01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:44.941
