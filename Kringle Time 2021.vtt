- Just give me the keys.
- Give me the keys.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.707
Give me the keys.

5
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.944
It's kringle time!

6
00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:37.079
There are. like.
forty people counting on me...

7
00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:39.181
Oh everyone's always
counting on you. Gary!

8
00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.217
Everyone always needs you. Gary!

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.818
Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary!

10
00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.123
The spotlight shines
real bright. doesn't it. Gary?

11
00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:49.524
I know it's not
mister goddamn wizard.

12
00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:51.994
but they still need someone
to run the fucking show

13
00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:53.528
and in order to run
the fucking show.

14
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:55.097
I need to get
to the fucking show

15
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.674
and in order to get
to the fucking show.

16
00:00:56.698 --> 00:00:59.668
I need the fucking car!

17
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.070
Blinders. Jerry!

18
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.172
My car!

19
00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:05.141
So what if it's in your name?

20
00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:34.236
You are more than this.

21
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.241
You are more than
the job you hold.

22
00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:45.780
You are more than
the town where you live.

23
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.919
You are a shining ball
in the darkness of existence.

24
00:01:49.952 --> 00:01:51.786
We're at ten minutes. jer.

25
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.657
On my way.

26
00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:05.201
- Herb's not at set.
- What? Where is he?

27
00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:07.602
I don't know.
But he's not at set.

28
00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.940
Intern said he's not
in the dressing room either.

29
00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:13.742
Ten minutes!

30
00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.112
Hey Gunther. my trash
still hasn't been taken out.

31
00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.047
- <i>Fünf minuten.</i>
- It's been four days.

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.547
can you take care of it. please?

33
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.217
- <i>Jawohl!</i>
- Can you just say "yes"

34
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.919
- in the future?
- <i>Jawohl.</i>

35
00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:25.754
I don't speak German. Gunther.

36
00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.126
Hey... who are you...

37
00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.593
Have you seen herb?

38
00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:35.031
Welcome to goshen public-access.
Mr. Mayor.

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:37.233
Oh. Jerry.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.077

I've had the pleasure.

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:40.936
Hiya Jerry.

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.104

I'm just joshin' ya!

44

But did you vote for me?

48
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.617
All right. love you. bye.

49
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.819

50
00:02:57.852 --> 00:02:59.621
Jer-bear. we're in the middle
of something.

51
00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:00.932
Please don't call me jer-bear.
I just want...

52
00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:03.259
♪ Leave us the fuck alone ♪

53
00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:04.193
Bye.

54
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.928
♪ Leave us the fuck alone ♪

55
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:07.339
- Jerry. where the fuck is herb?
- Looking for him right now.

56
00:03:07.363 --> 00:03:09.165
I need to mic him up
before we go live.

57
00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:11.143
Sound doesn't penetrate
a fucking snowsuit. Jerry.

58
00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.937
- I'm on it. Karen.
- Aw thanks. asshat.

59
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.704
Six minutes.

60
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.606
Good morning. goshen.

61
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.741
Morning.

62
00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:20.976
Good morning. goshen!

63
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.845
- Good morning go-shen...
- Ernest!

64
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.956
- Have you seen herb?
- What?

65
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.215
- Herb.
- What?

66
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.952
I... I don't know. Jerry.

67
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:31.387
Okay.

68
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.155
Hey. have we checked
his dressing room?

69
00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.623
The sign on the door
says "in kringle time."

70
00:03:35.657 --> 00:03:37.126
I just assumed he's on set.

71
00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.904
- That's not what that means.
- What does it mean?

72
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:40.728
Herb needs personal time
during the day.

73
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.640
- He calls it "kringle time."
- Well it's also the name

74
00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:44.934
of the show.
so it's just confusing.

75
00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:48.003
It is confusing.
thank you. Greg.

76
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:51.639
- Herb. we're at...
- Jerry. I have to quit.

77
00:03:51.673 --> 00:03:52.408
Wh... can we talk about this
later?

78
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.643
No. I'm sorry.

79
00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:04.819
Herb. we gotta stop
burning through interns.

80
00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:07.923
It's this place. Jerry.

81
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:19.868
When your dad and I
started this show.

82
00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:21.370
I never thought I'd be here now.

83
00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:22.847
We really don't have time
for this today.

84
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.175
Three decades and here I am.

85
00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:30.045
Gathering dust inside
a fraying snowman.

86
00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.780
Doesn't sound so bad.

87
00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.117
You're a fuck-up. Jerry.

88
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:40.022
You don't know nothing.

89
00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:46.395
Okay.

90
00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:48.230
- Hey. big love.
- Tell me the mantra again.

91
00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:49.398
Take the turn!

92
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.100
Come on. Grayson. you fuck!

93
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:53.235
Is that my daughter
on the phone?

94
00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:55.337
- Yes.
- At the fucking Hamptons!

95
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:56.948
Herb won't come to set. what's
the thing you said last time?

96
00:04:56.972 --> 00:04:58.183
Come on. Grayson.
you're better than this.

97
00:04:58.207 --> 00:05:00.342
- What did you say last time?
- Oh.

98
00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:04.113
Tell him there's only
one kringles.

99
00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:07.316
Can't control our legacy. Jerry.

100
00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.085
That's... that's
what I figured out.

101
00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.156
At the end of the day.
our life's just a...

102
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.859
There's only one kringles.

103
00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:23.499
Fuck it.

104
00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:25.767
Karen. found your snowman!

105
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.437
- How you doing. love?
- For fuck's sake. herb!

106
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.272
Ugh. god. you smell
like piss on the rocks.

107
00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:31.974
- Yeah. well...
- We got two minutes!

108
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:33.741
I feel like Brooklyn
is where I belong.

109
00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:35.743
but Manhattan is. like. my soul.

110
00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:37.479
- Uptown or downtown?
- No. Manhattan.

111
00:05:37.513 --> 00:05:39.181
- You found herb?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:41.450
- Is he drunk?
- Where's the mayor?

113
00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:45.988
Oh Jesus.

114
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.022
Mr. Mayor.

115
00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.391
Is this 4k. or what?

116
00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:50.792
Yeah. it's great. huh?

117
00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:52.127
Don't wander off.

118
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:54.129
- Yeah. great technology.
- Mhm.

119
00:05:54.163 --> 00:05:58.934
- You use three cameras on this?
- That's right.

120
00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:02.071
Herb. you good?

121
00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:04.039
As good as it gets. jer.

122
00:06:08.544 --> 00:06:11.547
Meant to say that kids
are the bane of my existence.

123
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.251
but that's. you know. you do
what you gotta do. right?

ex-wife. sue Ann.

that was not already said
by herb?

203
00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:39.801
He was a man who demanded
much from others.

204
00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:45.574
And less... much less
from himself.

Well that oughta be fun.

Our target audience
is five-year-olds.

215
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.885
We could swap the body out
of that suit mid-episode

216
00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:23.980
and they wouldn't notice.

217

- He's young. he's handsome.
- Who cares if he's handsome?

226
00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:51.707
He's gonna be inside
of a snowman.

227

- He's great with the kids.
- Yeah

228
00:13:53.308 --> 00:13:56.012

their own kind.

00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:16.212
but that's just my opinion.

352
00:22:16.245 --> 00:22:18.380
Yeah. it's in williamsburg.

353
00:22:18.414 --> 00:22:20.782
Ugh. oh my gosh.
I love williamsburg.

354
00:22:20.815 --> 00:22:23.118
That's so cute.

355
00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:24.852
If I put down
my deposit by the 14th.

356
00:22:24.887 --> 00:22:26.064
I could move in.
like. next month.

357
00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:27.523
Do it. do it. do it!

358
00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:30.059
- Guys. I have something to say.
- Oh. oh. oh. oh.

359
00:22:30.092 --> 00:22:34.396
Hey. hey. you guys.
you guys. the boss is here.

360
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.198
I'm not your boss.

361
00:22:36.232 --> 00:22:40.102
Hey. Jerry. raise your hand.

362
00:22:40.135 --> 00:22:42.238
That's how many people care.

363
00:22:42.271 --> 00:22:45.174
Ah. okay.

364
00:22:45.207 --> 00:22:47.009
Hey Jerry. Jerry.
if you respected yourself

365
00:22:47.042 --> 00:22:48.520
a little more. you'd probably
fix a lot of problems

366
00:22:48.544 --> 00:22:53.048
at work. bro. and at home!

367
00:22:53.082 --> 00:22:54.283
Okay. great.

368
00:22:54.316 --> 00:22:57.920
Um. so look I. uh...

369
00:22:57.953 --> 00:23:00.089
I grew up with kringle time.

370
00:23:00.122 --> 00:23:03.825
Okay. I... I believe
in kringle time.

371
00:23:03.858 --> 00:23:07.529
I've given my life to this
station because of kringle time.

372
00:23:12.534 --> 00:23:14.503
When I was nine years old.

373
00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:17.139
I started writing down
my ideas for the show.

374
00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:21.877
And more than anything
in the entire world

375
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.978
I wanted to be kringles.

376
00:23:25.047 --> 00:23:27.516
- Is he gonna cry?
- I'm not just a pencil pusher.

377
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:29.952
Okay. I've been planning this
my entire life.

378
00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:34.089
And I know you guys
don't trust me. but...

379
00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:37.859
Herb did. so trust him.

380
00:23:44.266 --> 00:23:46.135

Awful. Jerry. very awful.

404
00:24:44.226 --> 00:24:48.897
That's the weirdest shit
I've ever seen. man.

405
00:24:56.538 --> 00:25:00.342
Sit down. Jerry.

406
00:25:03.412 --> 00:25:06.014
Jerry.

407
00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:09.985
Who is kringles?

408
00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:12.488
Kringles is a magical
snowman from Alaska

409
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:14.323
who was brought to life
by an ice wizard.

410
00:25:14.356 --> 00:25:16.592
He's fueled by the power
of wishes.

411
00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:18.494
Hm. wrong.

412
00:25:18.527 --> 00:25:20.229
Kringles is a knock-off frosty

413
00:25:20.262 --> 00:25:21.964
the station
didn't have to license.

414
00:25:21.997 --> 00:25:25.601
Okay. kringles is way different
than frosty the snowman.

415
00:25:25.634 --> 00:25:27.669
- that's...
- Oh. how?

416
00:25:27.703 --> 00:25:29.705
Uh. well he has a lasso.
for one thing.

417
00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:32.674
Hm. and why does a snowman
need a lasso. Jerry?

418
00:25:32.708 --> 00:25:34.376
Uh. because. Daphne.

419
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.612
the lasso contains the spirit
of Arizona Willie.

420
00:25:36.645 --> 00:25:38.113
which of course
can only be summoned

421
00:25:38.147 --> 00:25:39.657
with the magical chant
by the children.

422
00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:41.984
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma.
I don't really understand

423
00:25:42.017 --> 00:25:43.719
the question.
it's in the goddamn song.

424
00:25:43.752 --> 00:25:46.955
Yeah but... look. I'm not gonna
have this argument with you.

425
00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:49.000
Kringles was the cheapest
costume they could afford.

426
00:25:49.024 --> 00:25:50.559
and it went from there.

427
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.995
My apologies. I should have been
a little more specific...

428
00:25:53.028 --> 00:25:54.072
Listen to the goddamn song.

429
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:58.333
Who is kringles to you?

430
00:25:58.367 --> 00:26:00.169
What?

431
00:26:00.202 --> 00:26:02.638
Who is kringles to you?

432
00:26:07.176 --> 00:26:11.113
Kringles taught me
right from wrong.

433
00:26:11.146 --> 00:26:14.416
He told me to believe in myself.

434
00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:20.756
He was my first friend.

435
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:22.124
Right.

436
00:26:25.661 --> 00:26:29.765
Now say we do...

437
00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:35.370
Whatever that is
and it hits home with one kid.

438
00:26:35.404 --> 00:26:40.075
one future Jerry out there
who really connects with it.

439
00:26:40.108 --> 00:26:43.779
But in doing so. we've robbed
a hundred other normal kids

440
00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:45.180
of that relationship
with kringles

441
00:26:45.214 --> 00:26:47.483
that you just mentioned.

442
00:26:47.516 --> 00:26:49.785
Does that seem worth it. Jerry?

443
00:28:29.718 --> 00:28:33.555
Good morning goshen.

444
00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:36.625
Goshen. city of goshen.

445
00:28:36.658 --> 00:28:39.795
Goshen public works
announced that the pothole

446
00:28:39.828 --> 00:28:43.632
on 2nd and Gage
has been filled in.

447
00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:48.136
I guess you could call it
a not-hole now.

448
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.572
And fear not. snowman fans.

449
00:28:50.606 --> 00:28:52.307
Because it's been confirmed

450
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:55.477
that kringles the snowman
will live on.

451
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:59.214
In the capable hands
of Jerry Perkins.

452
00:28:59.247 --> 00:29:01.850
So tune in on Saturday
at the regular time.

453
00:29:01.884 --> 00:29:04.586
coming up this Saturday.

454
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.655
And why don't we
all wish Jerry...

455
00:29:06.688 --> 00:29:09.591
Let's wish Jerry good times.

456
00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:11.560
Jerry's playing kringles.

457
00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:39.655
Jerry. how we doing. buddy?

458
00:29:39.688 --> 00:29:42.357
You ready to get started?
You feel good? You look good.

459
00:29:42.391 --> 00:29:43.869
- Yeah. let's go. come on!
- All right.

460
00:29:43.893 --> 00:29:46.695
Pow pow!

461
00:29:46.728 --> 00:29:48.697
- Pow!
- Pow.

462
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.508
Keep it positive.
keep it fresh. keep it bright

463
00:29:50.532 --> 00:29:52.200
and we're gonna do it big. okay?

464
00:29:52.234 --> 00:29:53.277
Just like every day. Here we go.

465
00:29:53.301 --> 00:29:54.904
Five. six. seven. eight.

466
00:29:54.937 --> 00:29:58.774
Shimmy and kringle twist!

467
00:29:58.807 --> 00:30:00.609
Ugh!

468
00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:04.379
Good girl.

469
00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:06.248
Dog store.
this is Layla speaking.

470
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:08.517
I can't do it. I'm freaking out.

471
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.286
- Just breathe. Jerry.
- I'm too old.

472
00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:14.556
I'm old and I'm soft
and I'm gonna die someday.

473
00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:17.292
- You're not gonna die. Jerry.
- We're all gonna die!

474
00:30:17.325 --> 00:30:19.861
And I'm gonna be forgotten.
like George lazenby.

475
00:30:19.896 --> 00:30:22.564
- Who?
- That's what I mean.

476
00:30:22.597 --> 00:30:24.499
He was James Bond. Layla.

477
00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:25.767
Freaking James Bond!

478
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:27.904
And now he's dead and forgotten.

479
00:30:27.937 --> 00:30:29.982
Or maybe he's still alive.
I don't know. I don't know.

480
00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:32.240
Nobody knows. you know why?
Because nobody gives a fuck

481
00:30:32.274 --> 00:30:33.943
about George lazenby!

482
00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:35.912
You know the combination
to your dad's safe?

483
00:30:35.945 --> 00:30:37.646
- I don't.
- He left me a safe

484
00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:39.581
with no combination.
I mean. who does that?

485
00:30:39.614 --> 00:30:41.850
I gotta go. babe. okay?

486
00:30:41.884 --> 00:30:44.252
There's whiskey in here
and I need it.

487
00:30:44.286 --> 00:30:49.458
You're gonna do great.
all right. just...

488
00:30:49.491 --> 00:30:52.394
- Big love.
- Big love.

489
00:31:02.304 --> 00:31:04.372
You are more than this...

490
00:31:30.532 --> 00:31:32.034
Dad?

491
00:31:34.536 --> 00:31:36.505
Blinders. Jerry.

492
00:31:45.982 --> 00:31:49.751
- Hey there. Jerry.
- Shit.

493
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:55.390
Hey. what are you doing?

494
00:31:55.423 --> 00:31:56.993
I'm fine. I'm fine.

495
00:31:57.026 --> 00:32:00.562
- Are you jerkin' it. dude?
- What? No. I'm not... no.

496
00:32:00.595 --> 00:32:04.666
- Hey guys. Jerry's jerking it!
- I'm not jerking it!

497
00:32:04.699 --> 00:32:06.368
God.

498
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:08.971
Hey man. have a good jerk.

499
00:32:09.005 --> 00:32:12.440
I'm not... I'm not jerk... naveed!

500
00:32:18.413 --> 00:32:19.648
Hiya Jerry. mayor jorkins.

501
00:32:19.681 --> 00:32:22.517
Yes sir. we've met
numerous times.

502
00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:23.962
- You got a minute?
- I'm actually really busy.

503
00:32:23.986 --> 00:32:25.496
- I've got a...
- It'll just take a second.

504
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.521
I'm sorry I gotta...

505
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.457
- What am I doing?
- No. no.

506
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.759
Come on. you want some coffee?

507
00:32:30.792 --> 00:32:32.427
Let's get some coffee.

508
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.462
Yeah. okay.

509
00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:36.132
I can't do it. Jerry.

510
00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:38.110
I'm not gonna get it done.
and then I'm just gonna be

511
00:32:38.134 --> 00:32:40.136
some guy who didn't build
a statue at all.

512
00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:42.004
- Okay. hey. here you go.
- Thank you. Jerry.

513
00:32:42.038 --> 00:32:44.539
Yeah.

514
00:32:47.977 --> 00:32:49.678
That's hot.

515
00:32:49.711 --> 00:32:50.779
It's a fresh pot.

516
00:32:50.812 --> 00:32:54.016
Mm.

517
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.717
I should just quit.

518
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.162
I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

519
00:32:57.186 --> 00:33:00.089
Hey. look. it's just a statue.

520
00:33:00.122 --> 00:33:01.900
I mean. don't kill yourself
building a monument

521
00:33:01.924 --> 00:33:05.527
to herb's massive ego.

522
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.931
Just a statue?

523
00:33:08.965 --> 00:33:11.399
No. Jerry.

524
00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:13.970
A statue is history.

525
00:33:14.003 --> 00:33:16.605
A statue is important.

526
00:33:16.638 --> 00:33:20.775
A statue looks
to the future and says.

527
00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:25.915
"hey future. I'm dead.

528
00:33:25.948 --> 00:33:28.850
But I wasn't always dead.

529
00:33:28.885 --> 00:33:33.923
And when I was alive...

530
00:33:33.956 --> 00:33:37.193
I mattered."

531
00:33:37.226 --> 00:33:39.095
You just need a little help.

532
00:33:39.128 --> 00:33:42.697
Look. hey. there's this guy who
helped Gunther a few years ago

533
00:33:42.731 --> 00:33:44.066
put the wainscoting in out back.

534
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.800
maybe he's still
got his contact.

535
00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:47.036
I'll ask him. all right?

536
00:33:47.069 --> 00:33:50.739
Hey Gunther... Jesus.

537
00:33:50.772 --> 00:33:55.577
You still got the card
for that guy who...

538
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.881
Thank you. Gunther.

539
00:33:58.915 --> 00:34:01.017
Here. maybe that'll help.

540
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.817
Give him a call.

541
00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:05.587
- Thanks. Jerry.
- Yeah.

542
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.589
Oh. what are we?

543
00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:09.457
Okay. all right.

544
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:12.995
- Thank you. Jerry.
- Oh god.

545
00:34:13.029 --> 00:34:15.463
All right. why don't... no. no.

546
00:34:15.497 --> 00:34:17.233
This is a lot.

547
00:34:17.266 --> 00:34:18.466
- Zip.
- Zap.

548
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.501
- Zip.
- Zap.

549
00:34:19.534 --> 00:34:20.468
- Zap.
- Zip.

550
00:34:20.502 --> 00:34:21.070
- Zip.
- Zap.

551
00:34:21.103 --> 00:34:21.603
- Zip. - zap.

552
00:34:21.636 --> 00:34:24.240
- Zip.
- Zip... oh.

553
00:34:24.273 --> 00:34:26.976
- You guys are coming for me.
- Guys?

554
00:34:27.009 --> 00:34:28.220
It's okay.
it's all right. buddy.

555
00:34:28.244 --> 00:34:29.577
Let's do it again. do it again.

556
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:30.947
- Guys?
- What. Jerry?

557
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.882
- This shit again.
- What's up. Jerry?

558
00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:36.118
I just want to say um...

559
00:34:36.152 --> 00:34:37.695
I know you guys don't think
I can do this...

560
00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.488
Oh my god.
you're like a broken record.

561
00:34:40.522 --> 00:34:44.126
Shut up.
this is a different thing.

562
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.162
I don't want to fight you guys.
okay?

563
00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:50.933
And I'm not going to.
I want to be a team player.

564
00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:53.102
I've been given
a huge opportunity here.

565
00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:55.972
and I just. uh...

566
00:34:56.005 --> 00:34:59.574
I won't let you down.

567
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:03.845
What are you doing?

568
00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:08.616
We miss him too. bro.

569
00:35:13.122 --> 00:35:14.991
Feeling strong there today. jer.

00:36:54.722 --> 00:36:56.992
And cue. Jaxon.

00:36:57.026 --> 00:36:58.693
I'm so glad you're back.

Oh thank you. Jaxon!

599
00:37:01.063 --> 00:37:05.067
And this time.
I promise I will live forever.

600
00:37:08.037 --> 00:37:10.072
We will never die!

601
00:37:10.106 --> 00:37:12.274
We will never die!

602
00:37:12.308 --> 00:37:14.376
- We will never die!
- Okay. okay. okay.

603
00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.278
You guys.
that sounds fucking great!

604
00:37:16.312 --> 00:37:20.648
We will never die!
We will never die!

We will never die.

607
00:37:39.068 --> 00:37:41.370
Then last week.
I fucked my sister's widower.

608
00:37:41.403 --> 00:37:44.240
I mean. his ass is incredible.
though.

609
00:37:44.273 --> 00:37:46.008
No. she died fine. it was...

610
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:47.409
Yeah? Oh. all right.

611
00:37:47.443 --> 00:37:49.345
Hey. father? Yeah. I gotta go.

612
00:37:49.378 --> 00:37:52.181
All right. love you. bye.
Yes. Jerry?

613
00:37:52.214 --> 00:37:55.850
Uh. I just had a question
about the script.

614
00:37:55.885 --> 00:37:58.254
Okay?

615
00:37:58.287 --> 00:37:59.730
It seems like we're
kind of telling kids

616
00:37:59.754 --> 00:38:02.824
that death doesn't matter.

617
00:38:02.857 --> 00:38:05.361
Hmm. it's interesting
you picked up on that.

618
00:38:05.394 --> 00:38:07.829
because that's exactly
what we're telling them.

619
00:38:07.862 --> 00:38:12.134
Ah and you don't think
that's kind of um...

620
00:38:12.168 --> 00:38:14.203
I don't know...

621
00:38:14.236 --> 00:38:17.206
Uh. irresponsible?

622
00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:19.841
Do you remember
our conversation. Jerry?

623
00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:22.411
About giving people
what they want?

624
00:38:22.444 --> 00:38:25.114
You know what kids want?

625
00:38:25.147 --> 00:38:26.482
Death.

626
00:38:26.515 --> 00:38:29.018
They love it.

627
00:38:29.051 --> 00:38:31.253
I'm fucking with you. Jerry!

628
00:38:31.287 --> 00:38:33.721
Kids hate death.
they want their snowman alive.

629
00:38:33.755 --> 00:38:35.925
- that's what they want.
- It just seems like this

630
00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:40.930
could be like
a teachable moment. or...

631
00:38:40.963 --> 00:38:44.433
Come here.

632
00:38:44.466 --> 00:38:45.968
Sit.

633
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.904
Now. I was waiting
to give this to you.

634
00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:54.876
Partly out of vindictiveness.
I'll admit. but...

635
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.146
- The magic lasso?
- Mhm.

636
00:39:03.385 --> 00:39:06.754
You've earned it. Jerry.

637
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:11.994
Now.

638
00:39:12.027 --> 00:39:14.129
I don't want you
to worry about the script.

639
00:39:14.163 --> 00:39:15.297
Okay?

640
00:39:15.331 --> 00:39:19.268
Kringles is a symbol.

641
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:23.973
What good would it do
to ruin that. huh?

642
00:39:24.006 --> 00:39:25.840
It's the night before the show.

643
00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:30.879
I want you to take Layla out
for a nice dinner and celebrate.

644
00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:34.816
Make her feel like a real woman.
can you do that. Jerry?

645
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:36.418
Yeah?

646
00:39:36.452 --> 00:39:39.154
Good boy.

647
00:39:39.188 --> 00:39:42.224
Woo. I do not plan on
being the executive director

648
00:39:42.258 --> 00:39:46.495
of a public-access station
my whole life. Jerry.

649
00:39:46.528 --> 00:39:51.033
Tomorrow. everything changes.

650
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.844
To kringles.

651
00:40:06.215 --> 00:40:07.483
Yep.

652
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.327
Daphne gave me the lasso today.

653
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.229
Didn't dad leave
you that in his will?

654
00:40:20.262 --> 00:40:26.502
No... yeah. he did.
she just gave it to me today.

655
00:40:26.535 --> 00:40:28.170
Okay.

656
00:40:28.203 --> 00:40:29.305
Cool.

657
00:40:34.043 --> 00:40:35.287
Are you. like.
mad at me about something?

658
00:40:35.311 --> 00:40:37.446
No. I'm just hungry.

659
00:40:42.284 --> 00:40:45.554
Can you slow down. please?

660
00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:48.991
Excuse me? Lady. can you?

661
00:40:49.024 --> 00:40:51.460
Just bring the
whole fucking bottle.

662
00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:53.929
Thank you.

663
00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:59.411
- It feels like you're mad at me.
- No. I'm not mad at you. Jerry.

664
00:40:59.435 --> 00:41:03.038
I just had a long day going
through my dead father's shit.

665
00:41:03.072 --> 00:41:04.349
So what. you want to eat dinner
at home every night

666
00:41:04.373 --> 00:41:06.275
for the rest of your life?

667
00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:13.949
I'm going to the bathroom.

668
00:41:13.982 --> 00:41:16.285
- To poop. Jerry!
- Okay.

669
00:41:28.564 --> 00:41:31.266
- What's the matter. cowpoke?
- Jesus Christ!

670
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.102
No.

671
00:41:33.135 --> 00:41:37.039
There is only kringles.

672
00:41:44.446 --> 00:41:46.348
Are you?

673
00:41:46.382 --> 00:41:49.651
Uh. man!

674
00:42:47.443 --> 00:42:51.313
Think of the children.

675
00:43:31.086 --> 00:43:32.621
Can we go home?

676
00:43:32.654 --> 00:43:34.656
I'm tired.

677
00:43:39.495 --> 00:43:45.801
Ugh.

678
00:43:47.436 --> 00:43:52.241
You ready?

679
00:43:52.274 --> 00:43:55.210
You need to puke?

680
00:43:55.244 --> 00:43:56.454
Are you not opening your mouth
'cause you're afraid

681
00:43:56.478 --> 00:44:02.518
you're gonna puke?

682
00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:06.121
You'll be fine.
big guy. come on!

683
00:44:06.154 --> 00:44:08.056
Right?

684
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.791
I mean. you better be fine.

685
00:44:09.825 --> 00:44:14.096
'Cause this show has
got to be fucking spectacular.

686
00:44:14.129 --> 00:44:16.598
You read me. Jerry?

687
00:44:16.632 --> 00:44:18.600
Hey.

688
00:44:18.634 --> 00:44:20.235
All right.

689
00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:23.772
Love yah. see you on the ice.

690
00:44:40.689 --> 00:44:43.392
Fade up twelve.

691
00:44:54.336 --> 00:44:55.737
Oh no. kringles fell down!

692
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:58.440
What can we do?

693
00:44:58.473 --> 00:45:01.643
Well. Jaxon.
sometimes people fall down

694
00:45:01.677 --> 00:45:03.812
and don't get back up again.

695
00:45:03.845 --> 00:45:07.849
And kringles...

696
00:45:07.884 --> 00:45:10.285
Oh. what?

697
00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:12.120
I'm alive!

698
00:45:16.525 --> 00:45:18.226
'Atta baby. jer.

699
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.529
Stand by. camera two.

Kringles is back. baby!

701
00:45:34.409 --> 00:45:36.845
Um. excuse me.

702
00:45:36.879 --> 00:45:39.581
- Jerry?
- I got it. I got it.

703
00:45:39.615 --> 00:45:40.917
Thank you all so much.

704
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.460
This has really been
a dream come true.

705
00:45:42.484 --> 00:45:44.820
and I just want to thank
every single one of you

706
00:45:44.853 --> 00:45:46.321
for making it happen!

707
00:45:46.355 --> 00:45:47.556
To Jerry!

708
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.579
Suck my dick. Luigi.

709
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:40.475
Heather!

710
00:46:40.509 --> 00:46:41.710
Right? The intern!

711
00:46:41.743 --> 00:46:43.278
Yeah!

712
00:46:43.311 --> 00:46:46.581
Man. you were there for what?
Six. seven?

713
00:46:46.615 --> 00:46:49.651
A day. I was there for a day.

714
00:46:49.685 --> 00:46:53.755
Was it a day?

715
00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:55.323
Oh. well. you know what?

716
00:46:55.357 --> 00:46:57.002
We miss you Heather.
wish you could have stayed.

717
00:46:57.026 --> 00:46:59.896
Me too. What'll you have. Jerry?

718
00:46:59.929 --> 00:47:01.763
- You know. I'm gonna have a...
- Jerry!

719
00:47:01.797 --> 00:47:06.768
Mayor jorkins. oh. you're so
handsome!

720
00:47:06.802 --> 00:47:09.304
Hey Jerry. great news
on the herb statue.

721
00:47:09.337 --> 00:47:10.872
I called that guy.
I paid him extra.

722
00:47:10.907 --> 00:47:13.475
I had to do a little creative
thing with the finances

723
00:47:13.508 --> 00:47:15.877
so people wouldn't. you know.
taxpayer... but anyway!

724
00:47:15.912 --> 00:47:17.412
It's gonna be ready
in two weeks!

725
00:47:17.446 --> 00:47:19.548
Two weeks. ah!

726
00:47:19.581 --> 00:47:22.284
I'm spending so much money on
this. and I am loving it.

727
00:47:22.317 --> 00:47:23.661
You're really building
a statue for that guy?

728
00:47:23.685 --> 00:47:25.787
Damn right. baby.
seventy feet tall!

729
00:47:25.821 --> 00:47:26.999
It's gonna be
about six feet tall.

730
00:47:27.023 --> 00:47:28.356
It's gonna block out the sun!

731
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.992
It's roughly herb-sized.

732
00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:33.795
- Can we have some shots?
- Two shots!

733
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:37.532
Heather is the best
because she brings me shots.

734
00:47:37.566 --> 00:47:42.004
Here we go!

735
00:47:42.038 --> 00:47:44.372
Love you.

736
00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:46.341
Good job!

737
00:48:28.017 --> 00:48:35.357
You were a grumpy
son-of-a-bitch. herb.

738
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.659
But thank you.

739
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:14.629
Oh.

740
00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:23.772
Oh!

741
00:49:33.782 --> 00:49:36.451
Oh shit.

742
00:50:09.784 --> 00:50:11.419
Hi there. Jerry.

743
00:50:11.453 --> 00:50:13.022
Hi. herb.

744
00:50:13.055 --> 00:50:16.725
Now. if you're watching this.
I'm dead.

745
00:50:16.758 --> 00:50:18.426
Probably from liver failure.

746
00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.198
or a car accident.
or a shootout.

747
00:50:22.231 --> 00:50:27.469
You probably also realize
that I left you kringles.

748
00:50:27.502 --> 00:50:30.538
which I think
is incredibly kind of me.

749
00:50:30.572 --> 00:50:34.542
so don't fuck it up. Jerry.

750
00:50:34.576 --> 00:50:39.714
Now. I would like you
do to a favor for me.

751
00:50:39.748 --> 00:50:45.654
In that safe. there's a shoebox
marked kringle time.

752
00:50:45.687 --> 00:50:47.822
I want you to take that shoebox

753
00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:49.824
and destroy it.

754
00:50:49.858 --> 00:50:53.595
Do not open it.
do not ask questions.

755
00:50:53.628 --> 00:50:55.597
just destroy it.

756
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.532
I want you to burn it.

757
00:50:57.565 --> 00:51:00.903
Burn it till
there is nothing left.

758
00:51:00.937 --> 00:51:04.941
That's all I need you
to do for me.

759
00:51:04.974 --> 00:51:07.609
Try not to fuck up. Jerry.

760
00:51:07.642 --> 00:51:08.945
Love ya.

761
00:51:10.745 --> 00:51:11.948
Oh!

762
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:14.183

Yeah.

It's not nothing.
what am I saying?

776
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.614
- Oh. Jesus.
- All right. Jerry.

777
00:52:52.647 --> 00:52:54.917
calm the fuck down.

778
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.651
Does anyone else know
about this?

779
00:52:58.988 --> 00:53:05.027
Okay. so we have a choice.

780
00:53:05.061 --> 00:53:09.231
Now. once we open that box.
we may not have a choice.

781
00:53:09.265 --> 00:53:11.167
This is one of those

782
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.003
pandora's cat
kind of situations. Jerry.

783
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:16.882
I mean. I understand
what you're saying.

784
00:53:16.906 --> 00:53:17.872
I don't think that's
the correct phrase. but...

785
00:53:17.907 --> 00:53:19.909
Okay. okay. okay.
think about it like this.

786
00:53:19.942 --> 00:53:21.676
Herb's dead!

787
00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:24.779
If anything was going on.
it's over!

788
00:53:24.813 --> 00:53:28.250
Whatever is in that box.

789
00:53:28.284 --> 00:53:31.020
what good would it do
to see the light of day?

790
00:53:31.053 --> 00:53:32.922
I don't know. I just...

791
00:53:33.889 --> 00:53:35.091
Listen to me.

792
00:53:35.124 --> 00:53:37.692
We brought kringles back
from the dead!

793
00:53:37.725 --> 00:53:40.262
Do you want to kill him again?

794
00:53:40.296 --> 00:53:42.098
You open that box.
and I promise you.

795
00:53:42.131 --> 00:53:43.999
you will bring the show down.

796
00:53:44.033 --> 00:53:47.635
And if the show goes down.
I go down.

797
00:53:47.669 --> 00:53:48.803
Do you want that?

798
00:53:51.673 --> 00:53:53.708
Okay. okay.

799
00:53:53.741 --> 00:53:56.112
Think about it like this.
all right?

800
00:53:56.145 --> 00:53:57.145
No!

801
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.918
Mark! Get me fire!

802
00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:06.788
- Daphne. come on!
- No!

803
00:54:06.821 --> 00:54:08.057
Just let it go!

804
00:54:11.327 --> 00:54:12.827
Gimme the goddamn box.

805
00:54:18.234 --> 00:54:20.002
Just let it happen. Jerry!

806
00:54:24.806 --> 00:54:27.243
No! No!

807
00:54:29.345 --> 00:54:30.346
I'm gonna throw up.

808
00:54:30.379 --> 00:54:31.347
Oh. god. no!

809
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.681
No! God!

810
00:54:33.715 --> 00:54:34.682
Fine!

811
00:54:34.716 --> 00:54:37.319
Fine. take the box!

812
00:54:37.353 --> 00:54:39.388
Oh. god. thank you.

813
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:41.123
No!

814
00:54:41.157 --> 00:54:42.258
Ow!

815
00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:43.758
No!

816
00:54:46.061 --> 00:54:47.963
God!

817
00:54:47.997 --> 00:54:49.265
Fuck!

818
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:56.038
She's so strong.

819
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:58.073
Why is she so strong?
She's a freak.

820
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:16.724
- Jerry.
- No!

821
00:55:16.758 --> 00:55:18.127
Damn it! Jerry!

822
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.827
Just hear me out! Hear me out.

823
00:55:31.207 --> 00:55:32.208
Look.

824
00:55:34.143 --> 00:55:36.912
I've been talking to the board
about giving you

825
00:55:36.946 --> 00:55:38.480
creative control
of kringle time.

826
00:55:42.551 --> 00:55:45.921
They think you've done
a hell of a job. Jerry.

827
00:55:45.955 --> 00:55:50.192
I mean. I think you've done
a hell of a job.

828
00:55:50.226 --> 00:55:51.961
And the audience.

829
00:55:51.994 --> 00:55:54.430
they love you!

830
00:55:54.463 --> 00:55:56.899
We could ride this wave. Jerry.

831
00:55:56.932 --> 00:55:58.476
I mean. herb. he was content
to be a big fish

832
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.002
in a small toilet.
but you and I?

833
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.405
We think big.

834
00:56:03.439 --> 00:56:05.374
We don't have to be stuck
at public access

835
00:56:05.407 --> 00:56:07.476
the rest of our lives.

836
00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:13.048
Kringles could be on
local affiliate stations. Jerry.

837
00:56:13.082 --> 00:56:14.450
How does that sound?

838
00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:26.228
If you want it.
the show is yours.

839
00:56:26.262 --> 00:56:28.097
Thank you all for coming.

840
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.532
You know. when herb
first gave me this task.

841
00:56:30.566 --> 00:56:33.535
to build this monument
in his honor.

842
00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:35.537
I felt unworthy.

843
00:56:35.571 --> 00:56:37.940
How could I. a humble mayor.

844
00:56:37.973 --> 00:56:40.509
two-time all-state
varsity swimming champion.

845
00:56:40.542 --> 00:56:42.144
and veteran.

846
00:56:42.177 --> 00:56:45.180
do justice to this great man?

847
00:56:45.214 --> 00:56:49.018
But with all your support.
we made this happen.

848
00:56:49.051 --> 00:56:50.219
Thank you.

849
00:56:55.624 --> 00:56:56.824
I want to thank fabio.

850
00:56:56.858 --> 00:56:58.060
Where's fabio?

851
00:56:58.093 --> 00:56:59.528
Thank you for all
your late nights

852
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:01.497
on this project.

853
00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.966
Love the ascot.

854
00:57:03.999 --> 00:57:06.834
And thank you all
for entrusting me

855
00:57:06.868 --> 00:57:09.305
with this sacred task.

856
00:57:09.338 --> 00:57:12.241
And I want to say.

857
00:57:12.274 --> 00:57:14.310
without exaggeration.

858
00:57:14.343 --> 00:57:17.112
that when I stand here
tomorrow morning

859
00:57:17.146 --> 00:57:18.914
and watch the sun crest
over the shoulders

860
00:57:18.947 --> 00:57:21.016
of this great man.

861
00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:25.954
it'll be the greatest moment
of my life.

862
00:57:25.988 --> 00:57:27.890
- You know. when I...
- I'll be right back.

863
00:57:27.923 --> 00:57:29.267
Was a young boy.
I visited the...

864
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:30.893
Heather!

865
00:57:30.926 --> 00:57:32.227
Sorry. um...

866
00:57:33.896 --> 00:57:35.340
- Why did you leave?
- I have to get to work.

867
00:57:35.364 --> 00:57:38.567
No. um. why did you
leave the show?

868
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.469
Don't act like you don't know.

869
00:57:40.502 --> 00:57:41.904
I... I don't.

870
00:57:41.937 --> 00:57:44.406
You were the one
who sent me to kringle time.

871
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.009
What... what do you mean?

872
00:57:47.042 --> 00:57:49.278
You were an intern for the show.

873
00:57:49.311 --> 00:57:51.580
- Thank you. Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you. thank you. thanks.

874
00:57:51.613 --> 00:57:53.515
I'd also like
to take this opportunity

875
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:55.384
to announce
the new creative director

876
00:57:55.417 --> 00:57:56.385
of kringle time...

877
00:57:56.418 --> 00:57:57.953
Mr. Jericho Perkins!

878
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.592
Here's to many more. Jerry!

879
00:58:03.625 --> 00:58:06.228
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Mr. Mayor.

880
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:07.596
- Truly.
- Thank you. thank you.

881
01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:02.644
You wanna get drunk?

882
01:00:02.678 --> 01:00:05.047
- I hated her!
- No. you didn't!

883
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.191
You had the biggest crush
on her.

884
01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:08.283
No. I didn't. she was dating...

885
01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.185
She was dating that dude Ross.

886
01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:11.153
She was dating that dude Ross.

887
01:00:11.186 --> 01:00:13.322
I swear to god
that dude couldn't count.

888
01:00:13.355 --> 01:00:14.395
He couldn't count numbers.

889
01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:16.358
Oh. Ross. yeah.

890
01:00:16.391 --> 01:00:18.393
He was a dick. though.
I would have dated her.

891
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.264
No. it was...
It was Mrs. Clarkson.

892
01:00:22.297 --> 01:00:23.565
she was math?

893
01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:25.167
- Was she math?
- No.

894
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.478
- Yes. she was math!
- I don't think so.

895
01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:29.705
Yes. because dad
had the hots for her!

896
01:00:29.738 --> 01:00:31.039
- Did not know that.
- Yes.

897
01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:33.542
dad wanted to do dick
stuff to her.

898
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.678
Fucking dad.

899
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.215
You've got the cutest face.

900
01:00:41.416 --> 01:00:43.218
Where did you get that face?

901
01:00:43.252 --> 01:00:44.720
- I don't know.
- You're so cute.

902
01:00:44.753 --> 01:00:46.822
Jerry!

903
01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:48.590
What are you doing?

904
01:00:48.624 --> 01:00:50.592
Stop it.

905
01:00:54.096 --> 01:00:55.430
Jerry?

906
01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:02.804
I feel like you want me to be
something different...

907
01:01:02.838 --> 01:01:04.773
Than who I am.

908
01:01:09.444 --> 01:01:11.580
So handsome.

909
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.623
I am not gonna
remember this tomorrow.

910
01:01:23.825 --> 01:01:25.827
I wonder if it even happened.

911
01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:45.641
Where are you?

912
01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:48.877
Where are you!

913
01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.814
Where are you?

914
01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:54.884
I wanna talk to you!

915
01:02:55.751 --> 01:03:00.322
Hello. Jerry.

916
01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:07.429
Show me herb.

917
01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:12.634
You're the all-powerful
fuckin' demon thingy.

918
01:03:14.536 --> 01:03:17.506
Show me herb's face.

919
01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:20.308
I wanna look him
in the fucking eyes.

920
01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:24.713
Show me. goddammit!

921
01:03:36.258 --> 01:03:38.393
Hiya. jer.

922
01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.333
What the fuck is wrong
with you. man?

923
01:03:45.367 --> 01:03:46.936
Hey. hey. settle down!

924
01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:48.670
I didn't kill anybody.

925
01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:50.439
Well. that's
a low fuckin' bar. herb.

926
01:03:50.472 --> 01:03:51.673
Come on. man.

927
01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:53.475
I've done nothing illegal.

928
01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:54.843
You took advantage
of those kids!

929
01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:56.611
They weren't kids!

930
01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:00.816
They're teenagers. we're talking
about goddamn teenagers.

931
01:04:00.849 --> 01:04:04.252
And I asked every one of them

932
01:04:04.286 --> 01:04:07.589
if they would do it.
and none of them said no.

933
01:04:07.622 --> 01:04:10.002
You were fucking kringles. man.
they're not gonna say no to you!

934
01:04:10.026 --> 01:04:11.626
Yeah. well.
they were fine with it.

935
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.662
They don't look
fucking fine. herb!

936
01:04:13.695 --> 01:04:14.730
You know what?

937
01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.465
I'm fucking sick of this!

938
01:04:16.498 --> 01:04:19.835
You drag me back
from beyond the grave.

939
01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:22.671
and after everything...

940
01:04:22.704 --> 01:04:27.043
Everything
that I've done for you.

941
01:04:29.979 --> 01:04:32.614
After everything
you've done for me?

942
01:04:32.647 --> 01:04:34.616
You never gave a shit about me.

943
01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:35.994
Even when you gave me
my dream job.

944
01:04:36.018 --> 01:04:37.519
you fucking poisoned it.

945
01:04:37.552 --> 01:04:38.620
The only reason I'm here

946
01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:40.789
is 'cause you knew
I'd do your dirty work for you.

947
01:04:40.822 --> 01:04:42.424
What have you given me. huh?

948
01:04:42.457 --> 01:04:44.368
Besides dangle a fucking carrot
in front of me for 20 years?

949
01:04:44.392 --> 01:04:47.596
Oh. wah. wah. poor little boy!

950
01:04:47.629 --> 01:04:50.632
Make a life for yourself. Jerry.

951
01:04:50.665 --> 01:04:53.568
You could have left at any time.
but you didn't.

952
01:04:53.602 --> 01:04:55.637
Why?

953
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.839
Because your dreams
weren't big enough.

954
01:04:57.873 --> 01:04:59.708
and you knew it.

955
01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:00.818
This is all beside the point.

956
01:05:00.842 --> 01:05:02.778
You had a responsibility
to those kids.

957
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.080
and you fucking betrayed us.

958
01:05:04.113 --> 01:05:05.781
Yeah. well don't pretend
you didn't know

959
01:05:05.814 --> 01:05:07.783
- what was happening.
- I didn't know!

960
01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:10.052
All that line of interns
that quit

961
01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:13.755
after going into kringle time
with me?

962
01:05:17.894 --> 01:05:19.061
You knew what was going on.

963
01:05:19.095 --> 01:05:21.630
You just chose to ignore it.

964
01:05:21.663 --> 01:05:24.699
That makes you as guilty as me.

965
01:05:24.733 --> 01:05:27.369
I 100% never lassoed
an intern. herb.

966
01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:30.006
"I never lassoed an intern."

967
01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:32.307
You wanna do something about it?

968
01:05:33.408 --> 01:05:35.844
I'm ashes.

969
01:05:35.877 --> 01:05:37.412
I don't care.

970
01:05:37.445 --> 01:05:38.948
Huh?

971
01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:54.897
Oh. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

972
01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.861
You didn't answer me.

973
01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:02.631
What are you going to do?

974
01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:08.436
I'm gonna tear
this whole fucking place down.

975
01:07:14.576 --> 01:07:18.613

you get tingles.

992
01:08:53.976 --> 01:08:57.313
Jerry. why aren't you
in costume. dude?

993
01:08:57.346 --> 01:08:58.780
It's in the dressing room.

994
01:08:58.813 --> 01:09:00.749
All right.

995
01:09:00.782 --> 01:09:02.817
I wanted to ask you. um.

996
01:09:02.851 --> 01:09:05.553
right here actually.
there it is.

997
01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:08.157
What's this "kringle surprise"
thing?

998
01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:09.892
Don't worry about that.

999
01:09:09.925 --> 01:09:11.227
What is it?

1000
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.660
Don't worry about it.

1001
01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.030
Like. I'm not worrying about it.

1002
01:09:14.063 --> 01:09:15.240
I just want to know what it is.

1003
01:09:15.264 --> 01:09:16.232
It's a surprise.

1004
01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:18.134
Don't worry about it.

1005
01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:21.103
See. now I'm... now I'm starting
to worry about it.

1006
01:09:21.137 --> 01:09:23.305
It's just a surprise.

1007
01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:24.873
Don't worry about it.

1008
01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:28.010
Okay.

1009
01:10:13.089 --> 01:10:16.092
You sure you want
to do this. Jerry?

1010
01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.792
Yes. dad.

1011
01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:19.361
I'm sure.

1012
01:10:19.395 --> 01:10:21.931
What about the kids?

1013
01:10:23.698 --> 01:10:25.968
I'm doing this for the kids.

1014
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:30.039
Uh. are you. Jerry?

1015
01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:33.409
Because if you open up
that box on air.

1016
01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:36.245
you are gonna traumatize
the shit out of them.

1017
01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:42.318
Yeah. well. they gotta grow up
sometime. right?

1018
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:43.785
I did.

1019
01:10:43.818 --> 01:10:45.363
You made sure of that
pretty goddamn early.

1020
01:10:45.387 --> 01:10:46.155
both of you.

1021
01:10:46.188 --> 01:10:48.090
I was just protecting you.
buddy.

1022
01:10:48.124 --> 01:10:49.992
I didn't need protecting.

1023
01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:54.163
I'm taking the blinders off.

1024
01:12:12.274 --> 01:12:14.376
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma!

1025
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.744
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma!

1026
01:12:32.328 --> 01:12:34.063
No. no.

1027
01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:37.066
No!

1028
01:12:37.099 --> 01:12:38.176
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1029
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200
Goddammit!

1030
01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.472
I'm an opportunist. jer.

1031
01:12:43.505 --> 01:12:45.873
What'd you expect?

1032
01:12:58.354 --> 01:13:01.490
Look. don't feel too bad.

1033
01:13:01.523 --> 01:13:04.059
If I had a nickel for every time
someone found me passed out

1034
01:13:04.093 --> 01:13:06.428
in front of
incriminating evidence...

1035
01:13:10.832 --> 01:13:13.569
Look. Jerry. you can't
make change from the bottom.

1036
01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.870
Power doesn't trickle up.

1037
01:13:15.904 --> 01:13:17.515
You want real change.
you know what has to happen?

1038
01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:19.441
The person at the top
has to give up control.

1039
01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:21.343
and people don't do that.

1040
01:13:22.945 --> 01:13:26.315
Think of it as a new beginning.

1041
01:13:47.936 --> 01:13:51.373
Yeah. so I missed the deposit
for the one in Brooklyn.

1042
01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:55.044
but I did find this one
in queens

1043
01:13:55.077 --> 01:13:57.845
that I could move into
by early October-ish.

1044
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.250
but I don't know. like.
is that too early?

1045
01:14:01.283 --> 01:14:03.319
Like early October-ish?

1046
01:14:03.352 --> 01:14:04.453
What the fuck?

1047
01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:06.088
Gunther!

1048
01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:08.557
Why hasn't my fucking trash
been taken out?

1049
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.392
- Fünf minuten...
- No! No!

1050
01:14:10.426 --> 01:14:13.228
Not fünf minuten. Right now!

1051
01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:15.998
All you have to do
is keep this place clean!

1052
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:18.233
You have one fucking job.

1053
01:14:18.267 --> 01:14:19.902
I want this trash cleaned up.

1054
01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:23.572
Not tomorrow. not next week.
not "fünf minutens."

1055
01:14:23.605 --> 01:14:25.074
right now!

1056
01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:27.409
Or you're fucking fired!

1057
01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:29.011
Hey. jer-bear!

1058
01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:30.045
Calm down. huh?

1059
01:14:30.079 --> 01:14:32.514
My name is Jerry. goddammit.

1060
01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:34.516
And the next person
to call me "jer-bear"

1061
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:36.285
is fucking fired. too!

1062
01:14:36.318 --> 01:14:37.929
Yeah. you're just
gonna fire everybody. huh.

1063
01:14:37.953 --> 01:14:40.122
big mister fuckin'
boss man or whatever?

1064
01:14:40.155 --> 01:14:43.525
Shut the fuck up. naveed!

1065
01:14:43.559 --> 01:14:48.364
Oh. and by the way.
you're never moving to Brooklyn.

1066
01:14:48.397 --> 01:14:49.932
What?

1067
01:14:49.965 --> 01:14:51.376
How long you been
talking about that. huh?

1068
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.401
Four years?

1069
01:14:52.434 --> 01:14:53.502
Five years?

1070
01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:56.071
Yeah. it just hasn't been
the right time yet.

1071
01:14:57.406 --> 01:14:58.440
It's not the right time?

1072
01:14:58.474 --> 01:15:00.008
Yeah. it's never the right time.

1073
01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:01.143
That's not the question.

1074
01:15:01.176 --> 01:15:04.179
The question is are you
the kind of person who goes.

1075
01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:05.948
or the kind of person who stays?

1076
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.849
Hm.

1077
01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:09.017
You're the kind of person
who stays.

1078
01:15:09.051 --> 01:15:10.185
Okay?

1079
01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:12.388
And take my advice.
realize that now.

1080
01:15:12.421 --> 01:15:14.957
It'll be less of a fall.

1081
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:18.160
Shitty. Jerry. Very shitty.

1082
01:15:18.193 --> 01:15:19.938
This is why we never wanted
to hang out with you.

1083
01:15:19.962 --> 01:15:21.597
I don't give a shit!

1084
01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:24.266
'Cause you're all
a big basket of assholes!

1085
01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:25.443
And it's about time
you showed me

1086
01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:27.369
some fucking respect!

1087
01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:55.964
1992. that season.
now everybody likes that season.

1088
01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:59.435
Tell you the truth. Ernie.
total blur.

1089
01:15:59.468 --> 01:16:02.070
I don't remember much
about it at all.

1090
01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:05.474
You know.
I knew Jamie farr back then.

1091
01:16:05.507 --> 01:16:07.743
- Introduced him to cocaine.
- Wow.

1092
01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:10.212
He introduced
Robert downey. Jr. to coke

1093
01:16:10.245 --> 01:16:11.680
and then we had a foursome!

1094
01:16:11.713 --> 01:16:13.382
So!

1095
01:16:13.415 --> 01:16:14.550
When are we going on air?

1096
01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.552
We're live now.

1097
01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:18.020
Shit.

1098
01:16:27.162 --> 01:16:30.165
So this season.
there's a kringles show.

1099
01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:34.470
Oh. yeah. we've got a singing.
dancing snowman. yeah.

1100
01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:36.004
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah. for sure.

1101
01:16:36.038 --> 01:16:37.606
Yeah. Anything else?

1102
01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:39.007
Anything else
we can expect to...

1103
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.075
No. no.

1104
01:16:40.108 --> 01:16:41.577
Oh. great. no. far out. far out.

1105
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.412
You know. I love...

1106
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:50.451
Whee!

1107
01:16:54.756 --> 01:16:57.593
Welcome back
to good morning. goshen!

1108
01:16:57.626 --> 01:16:59.361
We're here with Herbert kelley.

1109
01:16:59.394 --> 01:17:00.429
Hi. herb. how's it going?

1110
01:17:00.462 --> 01:17:01.763
- Very good.
- Oh. good. good.

1111
01:17:01.797 --> 01:17:03.398
that's good to hear. yeah. yeah.

1112
01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:05.310
So you were talking a little bit
about kringle time.

1113
01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:07.378
- Tell us a little bit more.
- It's a different kind of show

1114
01:17:07.402 --> 01:17:09.238
from what people
are prepared for.

1115
01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:10.339
Different kind of show.

1116
01:17:10.372 --> 01:17:12.040
How's that?

1117
01:17:12.074 --> 01:17:14.309
I think kids are smart.

1118
01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:15.753
And I believe that
the worst thing that we can do

1119
01:17:15.777 --> 01:17:18.580
as adults is to pretend
that life's not hard.

1120
01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:20.749
I mean. the world's
a hard place.

1121
01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:24.186
and it's a confusing place.
but...

1122
01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:27.389
There's a beauty
in that confusion.

1123
01:17:27.422 --> 01:17:30.092
If there's a guiding principle
behind kringle time...

1124
01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:34.229
it's about being honest
about who you are

1125
01:17:34.263 --> 01:17:35.564
and what you want to do.

1126
01:17:35.597 --> 01:17:37.132
Because if kringles exists

1127
01:17:37.165 --> 01:17:40.168
at the expense
of being genuine. then.

1128
01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:41.246
well. maybe there comes a time

1129
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:45.140
when the world doesn't need
kringles anymore.

1130
01:17:59.321 --> 01:18:00.656
Gunther!

1131
01:18:00.689 --> 01:18:02.691
Jesus.

1132
01:18:02.724 --> 01:18:05.460
Gunther. where's my trash?

1133
01:18:05.494 --> 01:18:08.130
I took it out. like you asked.

1134
01:18:08.163 --> 01:18:09.431
- Am I fired?
- No!

1135
01:18:09.464 --> 01:18:11.867
No. I'm sorry. Gunther. man.
I was a dick.

1136
01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:16.104
Look. is there any way I can
still get a hold of that trash?

1137
01:18:28.684 --> 01:18:30.319
Ah!

1138
01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.360
Ew. gross. Jerry!

1139
01:18:38.393 --> 01:18:40.395
All right. listen up. fuckers.

1140
01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:42.497
I'm the creative director
of kringle time.

1141
01:18:42.531 --> 01:18:44.800
And guess what?

1142
01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:47.169
We got some changes
we're gonna make.

1143
01:19:23.372 --> 01:19:25.641
Kringles.

1144
01:19:25.674 --> 01:19:28.443
I brought you this mouse.

1145
01:19:28.477 --> 01:19:31.546
but it died in my hands.

1146
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.251
This mouse...

1147
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.689
is my father.

1148
01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:46.896
Kringles!

1149
01:19:47.763 --> 01:19:49.966
Jessica.

1150
01:19:49.999 --> 01:19:51.733
I'm pregnant!

1151
01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:55.570
What?

1152
01:19:55.604 --> 01:19:57.239
I'm pregnant!

1153
01:19:58.807 --> 01:19:59.875
What?

1154
01:19:59.909 --> 01:20:02.344
I'm pregnant!

1155
01:20:02.377 --> 01:20:03.712
Oh.

1156
01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:05.714
What?

1157
01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:09.618
Oh. no!

1158
01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:11.420
Ken starr!

1159
01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:13.755
I'm gonna get ya!

1160
01:20:17.292 --> 01:20:18.627
Come on. kids!

1161
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.932
Let's play a game
of hide and no-seek!

1162
01:20:36.445 --> 01:20:37.746
Mr. Mayor. I'm sorry.

1163
01:20:37.779 --> 01:20:39.247
I've got other things
to deal with.

1164
01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:40.282
Okey-dokey. I gotcha.

1165
01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:42.651
but if we could just circle back
about the statue...

1166
01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:43.819
Anita?

1167
01:20:43.852 --> 01:20:44.786
Yeah?

1168
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.688
Can you show the mayor
the traffic cameras

1169
01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:48.490
at 1st and Samson?

1170
01:20:48.523 --> 01:20:50.927
Yeah.

1171
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.828
Thank you.

1172
01:20:55.597 --> 01:20:57.934
I really appreciate this. Anita.

1173
01:20:57.967 --> 01:21:00.036
It's been a tough few days.

1174
01:21:00.069 --> 01:21:02.304
Yeah.

1175
01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:06.508
Oh. there!

1176
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:07.709
Can you zoom in?

1177
01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.844
Yeah.

1178
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.682
Is that Jerry?

1179
01:21:13.715 --> 01:21:16.518
Yeah.

1180
01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:17.853
What is he doing?

1181
01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:31.967
Where'd he go?

1182
01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:38.373
Jerry.

1183
01:21:39.909 --> 01:21:41.343

after a word from our sponsors.

1192
01:22:21.951 --> 01:22:23.652
And we're out.

1193
01:22:23.685 --> 01:22:24.921
Yeah.

1194
01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.124
That was incredible!

1195
01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.025
Really great stuff.

1196
01:22:29.058 --> 01:22:32.627
What in the ever-living fuck
was that?

1197
01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:34.030
You gave me creative control.

1198
01:22:34.063 --> 01:22:36.765
And I told you to color
inside the fucking lines.

1199
01:22:36.798 --> 01:22:38.533
Jerry. I told you!

1200
01:22:38.567 --> 01:22:39.401
If you keep going like this.

1201
01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:40.678
you are going to kill
kringle time...

1202
01:22:40.702 --> 01:22:42.604
Is that what you want?

1203
01:22:45.174 --> 01:22:46.943
Oh. Jesus lord. of course.

1204
01:22:46.976 --> 01:22:48.643
Why didn't I realize it before?

1205
01:22:48.677 --> 01:22:50.545
You're just enough
of a fucking psychopath

1206
01:22:50.579 --> 01:22:52.949
- to tank your own show!
- Wait. what?

1207
01:22:52.982 --> 01:22:54.951
- You didn't approve this?
- Who's Ken starr?

1208
01:22:54.984 --> 01:22:57.019
Fuck no. you idiots!

1209
01:22:57.053 --> 01:23:00.522
- Liar. Jerry. very liar!
- What the hell. Jerry?

1210
01:23:00.555 --> 01:23:02.058
- The show must go on.
- Wow.

1211
01:23:02.091 --> 01:23:03.425
You are right about that.

1212
01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:04.492
Get him out of this suit.

1213
01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:06.162
Mark. you are up.

1214
01:23:06.195 --> 01:23:07.997
Sorry about this. Jerry...

1215
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.932
- No!
- Give me the glove!

1216
01:23:09.966 --> 01:23:11.901
- You guys like wrestling?
- Mark!

1217
01:23:13.869 --> 01:23:15.104
- Get up!
- Get up. Jerry.

1218
01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:19.708
A. b. c. d...

1219
01:23:21.576 --> 01:23:23.879
You can't do this.

1220
01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:26.916
I can do anything I want. Jerry.

1221
01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:30.518
I'm the executive director
of goshen public access.

1222
01:23:32.754 --> 01:23:34.924
Sorry. jer. Love you. buddy.

1223
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.464
No!

1224
01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.637
Can we have more time?
I don't have a mic!

1225
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:49.906
How are we gonna...

1226
01:23:49.939 --> 01:23:51.083
- Four...
- Just make it look happy!

1227
01:23:51.107 --> 01:23:52.641
Three...

1228
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:57.812
Hey. kids!

1229
01:23:57.846 --> 01:23:59.781
Come on now. Jerry. come on.

1230
01:24:02.985 --> 01:24:04.921
It's done. Jerry.

1231
01:24:04.954 --> 01:24:07.089
Your kringle time
has come to an end.

1232
01:24:08.857 --> 01:24:13.062
You will be nothing
but a blip in history.

1233
01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:15.998
Like George lazenby.

1234
01:24:16.032 --> 01:24:17.199
Motherfucker.

1235
01:24:17.233 --> 01:24:19.068
What I learned
from the afterlife

1236
01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:22.504
is there's
no such thing as sadness!

1237
01:24:22.537 --> 01:24:24.040
- Uh. yes!
- Oh. goddammit.

1238
01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.615
Why did you take
your blinders off?

1239
01:24:33.648 --> 01:24:35.650
All of it could have been yours.

1240
01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:40.222
You can't kill a symbol.

1241
01:24:40.256 --> 01:24:43.059
You try to break the symbol.

1242
01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:46.628
the symbol breaks you.

1243
01:24:52.734 --> 01:24:57.706
You know.
it's funny you say that.

1244
01:24:57.739 --> 01:25:00.076
Because really.

1245
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:02.278
anything will kill a snowman.

1246
01:25:03.913 --> 01:25:06.815
Literally just existing
long enough

1247
01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:09.285
will kill a snowman.

1248
01:25:09.318 --> 01:25:15.024
We only build snowmen
to slowly watch them die.

1249
01:25:15.057 --> 01:25:16.858
What does that say about us?

1250
01:25:20.762 --> 01:25:22.564
But you know.

1251
01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:24.766
the quickest way
to kill a snowman?

1252
01:25:35.277 --> 01:25:37.313
Fire.

1253
01:25:37.346 --> 01:25:41.183
If you do it. they'll hate you.

1254
01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:52.560
Kringle twist!

1255
01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:01.103
Fire alarms?

1256
01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:02.704
Since when are those...

1257
01:26:02.737 --> 01:26:03.805
Fire!

1258
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.843
♪ The fire's only
in your imagination ♪

1259
01:26:08.877 --> 01:26:10.678
Come on. everyone.
let's go. there's a fire!

1260
01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:11.846
Apparently.

1261
01:26:11.881 --> 01:26:13.258
Gunther. it's a big fire.
that's not gonna work!

1262
01:26:13.282 --> 01:26:15.017
You gotta go. come on!

1263
01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.053
Come on. everyone.
yeah. let's go!

1264
01:26:17.086 --> 01:26:19.221
Come on. here we go.
let's go to safety!

1265
01:26:19.255 --> 01:26:20.622
Mark. Mark. Mark!

1266
01:26:20.655 --> 01:26:22.590
Hey. listen. you gotta
take the suit off. man.

1267
01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:23.768
Hey. you're not gonna make it!

1268
01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:25.327
- Are you an angel?
- Mark!

1269
01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:28.130
Take the suit off.
I'll protect the suit!

1270
01:26:37.106 --> 01:26:40.708
Jerry! You son of a bitch!

1271
01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:42.877
- Jerry!
- What are you doing?

1272
01:26:42.912 --> 01:26:44.779
- There's a fire in there!
- Jerry!

1273
01:26:44.813 --> 01:26:47.682
Jerry. you let me
back in there right now.

1274
01:26:47.715 --> 01:26:48.616
What the fuck?

1275
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:49.684
Fire in there. Jerry!

1276

1277
01:26:54.223 --> 01:26:56.892

No. no. Ernest. Ernest.
wait. wait.

1281

1282
01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:05.000
Just hear me out. okay?

1283
01:27:05.034 --> 01:27:07.702
Look. you love
doing your show. right?

1284
01:27:07.735 --> 01:27:08.703
Every week. I let you
go out there

1285

1288
01:27:13.175 --> 01:27:14.176
That's all I want.

1289
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.911
I just want five minutes. ern.

1290
01:27:15.945 --> 01:27:18.080
Can you help me do that. please?

1291
01:27:18.114 --> 01:27:20.082
There is no fire in there!

1292
01:27:22.284 --> 01:27:23.919
What do you say. buddy?

1293
01:27:31.227 --> 01:27:32.437
- You fucking idiot.
- Oh. fuck. you're right.

Oh. look. this one's
from the IRS. kids!

1316
01:28:59.081 --> 01:29:00.748
You know what the IRS is?

1317
01:29:00.782 --> 01:29:01.917
Yay!

1318
01:29:03.118 --> 01:29:04.920
Jerry.

1319
01:29:11.894 --> 01:29:16.031
Kringles has had
a rough week. kids.

1320
01:29:16.065 --> 01:29:18.100
Going through some stuff.

1321
01:29:19.834 --> 01:29:21.370
Might sound boring
to some of you.

1322
01:29:21.403 --> 01:29:23.105
I'm not sure. but...

1323
01:29:23.138 --> 01:29:24.772
I guess if it comes down
to a choice

1324
01:29:24.806 --> 01:29:27.009
between connecting
with one person

1325
01:29:27.042 --> 01:29:31.380
versus guessing what
a bunch of people might want.

1326
01:29:31.413 --> 01:29:35.117
I figure it's better to go
for the audience of one.

1327
01:29:50.065 --> 01:29:52.368
My name is Jerry.

1328
01:29:52.401 --> 01:29:55.070
and I play kringles.

1329
01:29:58.374 --> 01:30:01.543
Before me. it was a guy
named herb. and. uh.

1330
01:30:01.577 --> 01:30:05.047
herb was a difficult man.

1331
01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.217
And to be honest. I hated him.

1332
01:30:10.286 --> 01:30:12.354
But when he put on this mask...

1333
01:30:16.492 --> 01:30:19.395
he became something
that I loved.

1334
01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:27.002
So what do you do with that?

1335
01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:33.342
Do you look behind the mask
at the real person?

1336
01:30:33.375 --> 01:30:35.277
I think that's our instinct.
right?

1337
01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:40.082
The mask is a facade.
but the person is real.

1338
01:30:40.115 --> 01:30:44.420
But the person is just a person.

1339
01:30:44.453 --> 01:30:48.123
And people die. Every day.

1340
01:30:48.157 --> 01:30:50.959
We lose good people.
we lose bad people.

1341
01:30:53.362 --> 01:30:56.864
Eventually. we lose everybody.

1342
01:30:56.899 --> 01:31:00.169
But the mask lives on.

1343
01:31:00.202 --> 01:31:03.072
The mask has power forever.

1344
01:31:05.974 --> 01:31:08.077
So which one's more important?

1345
01:31:11.914 --> 01:31:13.282
I don't know
the answer here. kids.

1346
01:31:13.315 --> 01:31:17.186
I'm still trying
to figure it out myself.

1347
01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:20.055
Kringles gets lost
sometimes. too.

1348
01:31:25.227 --> 01:31:26.362
Here's the thing. kids...

1349
01:31:28.097 --> 01:31:29.341
you can't choose who you are.

1350
01:31:29.365 --> 01:31:30.566
The mayor!

1351
01:31:30.599 --> 01:31:32.935
But you can choose
who you want to be.

1352
01:31:32.968 --> 01:31:34.236
And personally...

1353
01:31:34.269 --> 01:31:36.105
Jerry!

1354
01:31:36.138 --> 01:31:38.440
I'd like to be something
different than I have been.

1355
01:31:39.575 --> 01:31:43.145
Naveed. I'm sorry. man.

1356
01:31:43.178 --> 01:31:45.681
I think you will move
to Brooklyn.

1357
01:31:45.714 --> 01:31:49.451
Gunther. I'm sorry
I never read your pilot.

1358
01:31:49.485 --> 01:31:51.186
I just...

1359
01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.188
Shit.

1360
01:31:54.156 --> 01:31:57.159
Heather.

1361
01:31:57.192 --> 01:31:59.495
and all the other interns...

1362
01:32:01.597 --> 01:32:03.332
I'm sorry.

1363
01:32:05.234 --> 01:32:06.435
I knew.

1364
01:32:06.468 --> 01:32:08.704
Or at least.
I should have known.

1365
01:32:08.737 --> 01:32:10.005
Stand back!

1366
01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:13.609
- It was just...
- Ah!

1367
01:32:13.642 --> 01:32:16.378
Just more comfortable
to ignore it. I guess.

1368
01:32:18.013 --> 01:32:21.116
And Layla. you already know.

1369
01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:26.488
Well. kids. uh.
I guess that's it.

1370
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:31.427
Kringles has to go home now.

1371
01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.662
You have a good life. cowpokes.

1372
01:32:35.464 --> 01:32:37.533
And if anyone needs
to hear this...

1373
01:32:40.402 --> 01:32:43.539
you are more than this.

1374
01:32:43.572 --> 01:32:47.743
You are more than
the job you hold.

1375
01:32:47.776 --> 01:32:50.746
You are more than
the town where you live.

1376
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:58.487
You are a shining ball
in the darkness of existence...

1377
01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.190
Ah!

1378
01:33:03.192 --> 01:33:04.560
He is mine!

1379
01:33:06.028 --> 01:33:08.230
Lemme at him!

1380
01:33:08.263 --> 01:33:10.566
I will fire each
and every one of you!

1381
01:33:13.402 --> 01:33:15.237
I have got this under control.

1382
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:16.638
Mr. Mayor. I have got this.

1383
01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:21.777
What the fu...

1384
01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.645
People were gonna point
at that statue

1385
01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:25.581
a hundred years from now.
and say.

1386
01:33:25.614 --> 01:33:27.382
"you know who built that. son?

1387
01:33:27.416 --> 01:33:30.352
Mayor Rodney jorkins
built that."

1388
01:33:30.385 --> 01:33:32.521
- Jorkins! Jorkins!
- Freeze!

1389
01:33:32.554 --> 01:33:33.722
Jorkins! Jorkins!

1390
01:33:33.755 --> 01:33:35.624
Now what are they gonna say?

1391
01:33:35.657 --> 01:33:38.026
They're gonna say nothing.
Jerry.

1392
01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:39.628
Is that what you want?

1393
01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:42.631
A future where people
are pointing at nothing?

1394
01:33:42.664 --> 01:33:44.299
What is happening?

1395
01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.334
Jorkins!

1396
01:33:45.367 --> 01:33:47.269
I got this.

1397
01:33:48.537 --> 01:33:49.505
Why?

1398
01:33:49.538 --> 01:33:50.772
How does that feel. Jerry?

1399
01:33:50.806 --> 01:33:52.140
Huh?

1400
01:33:55.377 --> 01:33:58.280
Oh. I tasted...

1401
01:34:05.087 --> 01:34:06.622
Ugh. fuck!

1402
01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:33.549
Well...

1403
01:34:36.184 --> 01:34:38.720
I did what you wanted.

1404
01:34:38.754 --> 01:34:40.455
Your legacy's fine.

1405
01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:45.794
For the moment. I guess.

1406
01:34:45.827 --> 01:34:49.131
Until all those kids
out there grow up.

1407
01:34:49.164 --> 01:34:53.735
get old. and die like me.

1408
01:34:53.769 --> 01:34:57.272
Just remember.
there's only one kringles.

1409
01:34:59.575 --> 01:35:03.612
Aren't you. like.
immortal now or some shit?

1410
01:35:05.614 --> 01:35:07.549
