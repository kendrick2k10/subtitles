00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.182
{\an8}LEAH
The story takes

4
00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.685
{\an8}place in a charming
little French village

5
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.271
{\an8}at Christmastime.

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.648
{\an8}In this idyllic
setting. our heroine

7
00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:28.778
{\an8}lives. a shy. hardworking
maid with dreams as expansive

8
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:31.031
{\an8}as the starry winter
sky and a heart

9
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.658
{\an8}as pure as the
fresh fallen snow.

10
00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.162
{\an8}She moves through her days
with a secret wish tucked deep

11
00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:41.332
{\an8}within her. a wish for a
love as deep as the rivers.

12
00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:45.337
{\an8}as enduring as the old stone
bridges of her village.

13
00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.381
{\an8}But such a love seems elusive.

14
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.467
{\an8}And then the hero comes in.

15
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.177
{\an8}He's perfect.

16
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.722
{\an8}He's a doctor. rides horses.

17
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.726
{\an8}The poor maid locks eyes with
him across the crowded market

18
00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.229
{\an8}and everything else melts away.

19
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.941
{\an8}And they know. in
that perfect moment.

20
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.779
{\an8}they're meant to be
together forever.

21
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.697
{\an8}Leah.

22
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.200
{\an8}Leah?

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.580
{\an8}Leah. honey. I know the story.
The Doctor and the Maid.

24
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.083
You made your father read
it to you every night.

25
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.668
Yeah. well. it's my favorite.

26
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.920
Yeah. well. you're not
going to find a husband

27
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.672
in a fairy tale. I'm afraid.

28
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.925
And I hate to say it but. honey.
you're not getting any younger.

29
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.051
Ow.

30
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.136
Thanks for the reminder. Mom.

31
00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.305
What about
Alexander from church?

32
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.474
I've always thought
he was very cute.

33
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.517
Well. cute.

34
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.434
Well-- tall.

35
00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.064
Can you stop trying to set
me up with every single man

36
00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.273
in the city.

37
00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.067
And Alexander is way too tall.

38
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.986
I would have neck
pain my entire life.

39
00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:57.117
Besides. I will know
it when I see him.

40
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.453
We'll lock eyes and--

41
00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.665
everything else will melt away.

42
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.084
Sounds lovely.

43
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:09.462
But I don't think it
always works like that.

44
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.258
And-- oh. honey.
I just think you

45
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.969
could be waiting a long time
for something like that.

46
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.970
It's not waiting.

47
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.346
It's being patient.

48
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.807
There's a difference.

49
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.436
And I remember a dad reading me
those stories when I was small.

50
00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:27.689
When he passed. someone
else read it to me.

51
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.482
You did.

52
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.485
You told me stories about how
you met and how amazing he was.

53
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.655
And I don't want to settle
for anything less than that.

54
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.992
Mom. I'm bored.

55
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.411
Hey. this is cute.

56
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.913
But I don't want to leave with
anything that isn't on my list.

57
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.457
OK. OK.

58
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.500
All I'm looking for
is a jewelry box--

59
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.922
wooden. simple. and-- elegant.

60
00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.008
Well. would you look at that.

61
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.926
It looks just like
the one your father

62
00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.136
gave you when you were little.

63
00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.680
Exactly. it's perfect.

64
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.848
Good eye.

65
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.850
We just got that in from France.

66
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.143
It used to play a melody.

67
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.270
But the mechanism is broken.

68
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.688
Do you know how old it is?

69
00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.981
No idea.

70
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.651
By the condition.
at least 50 years.

71
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.153
Great. I'll take it.

72
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:18.156
And. uh. this as well.

73
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.951
I thought you weren't
getting anything

74
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.161
that wasn't on your list.

75
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.038
Yes. but the list is--

76
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.873
Subject to change.

77
00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.918
Exactly.

78
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.088
Hey. someone to
keep you company.

79
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.757
Merry Christmas.

80
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.093
Oh. cute.

81
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.929
So tell me again
how you and dad met.

82
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.431
Ah. we were young--

83
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.226
much younger than you are now.

84
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.769
Yes. The Doctor
and the Old Maid.

85
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.603
I get it.

86
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.235
Yes. we're here at the
Museum of Modern Art where

87
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.737
they're moments away from
unveiling the brand-new

88
00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.531
Christmas exhibition.

89
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.658
The highlight of the
collection undoubtedly

90
00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.577
is a piece from an
artist in post-war France

91
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.454
and has been
causing quite a stir

92
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.831
with its enigmatic subject.

93
00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.088
It's a-- painting.

94
00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.549
What's the big deal?

95
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.135
It's the mystery of
it. an unknown artist.

96
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.553
It's romantic.

97
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.304
It brings up so many
interesting questions.

98
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.389
Who is this woman?

99
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.807
Where was it painted?
Why?

100
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:26.599
When did she--

101
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.559
When's lunch?

102
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.852
Exactly.

103
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.311
Come on. Mark.

104
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.272
You don't feel anything
when you look at this?

105
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.942
I feel-- like we
both should be covering

106
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.986
something more important.

107
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.945
Well. we saw it.

108
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.946
Come on. Brian.

109
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:40.780
Let's go.

110
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.286
And while we
don't know the artist's name.

111
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.621
the painting is
dedicated to someone

112
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.625
named Ma Fleur. which translates
from the French to "my flower."

113
00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:58.757
And-- come on. what a
dedication. so romantic.

114
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.426
The only identifying information
we have is the signature

115
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:06.139
of the artist with just
the letter F. This piece.

116
00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.811
alongside its story. is sure to
be the talk of the new exhibit.

117
00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:32.207
Do you know what
"Marché de Noel" means?

118
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.583
I took Spanish in high school.

119
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.168
And I don't even remember that.

120
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.587
It means "Christmas Market."

121
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.632
They pop up every winter in
various towns across Europe.

122
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:44.094
They're quaint. romantic
festivals with twinkling

123
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.137
lights and cozy drinks.

124
00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:51.685
And this journal is all about
finding love-- true love

125
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.978
at the Christmas market
in a French village

126
00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.022
called Petit Marchand.

127
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.024
It's a love story.

128
00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.235
Well. the drawing does
look similar to the painting.

129
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.361
Right?

130
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.405
OK. now. look at the signature.

131
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.327
Huh. you have
my full attention.

132
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.704
What does it say?

133
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:14.624
OK. so F recounts
the story of falling

134
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.210
in love with Ma Fleur
on the first night

135
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.713
of the Marché de Noel. right?

136
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.798
And he talks about
the legend of the town

137
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.592
that you are destined
to meet your soulmate

138
00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.636
at Le Marché de Noel.

139
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:30.056
And he's sure that
he's found his.

140
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.226
And him and Ma Fleur both
know that her parents

141
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.769
wouldn't approve.

142
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.690
So they meet secretly
every night at the market.

143
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.902
And after he proposes.
they decide to elope.

144
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.237
Very Romeo and Juliet.

145
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.739
Without the tragic
ending. I hope.

146
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.741
It actually doesn't even
have an ending at all.

147
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.701
The last few pages
are missing. so--

148
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.536
Sounds like the kind
of human interest story

149
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.579
The Post would love.

150
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.581
Except I am not a journalist.

151
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.833
Yet.

152
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.878
I think this story could
bring you up to the majors.

153
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.005
You know. maybe I should
buy a ticket to France

154
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:05.550
and visit that magical town.
find my perfect soulmate.

155
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.177
and finally finish
a writing sample

156
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.346
that I am proud to submit.

157
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.433
Leah. you're passionate.
articulate. driven. more

158
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.560
optimistic than anyone I know.

159
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.854
You'd be a great journalist.

160
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:21.316
But waiting for the perfect
moment or the perfect writing

161
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.609
sample to fall
into your lap isn't

162
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.985
going to get you anywhere.

163
00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.988
Well. hey. biding my
time to get what's right

164
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.740
isn't always a bad thing.

165
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.992
If you're happy
being a copy editor.

166
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.286
Hey. copy editor.
finish proofreading

167
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.662
the Johnson article?

168
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:35.580
I am.

169
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.791
It should be in your inbox.

170
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.958
Great.

171
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.585
Oh. but I did notice
a couple of times

172
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.754
that you have misused
the word "disinterested."

173
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.381
It's a common
misconception. you know.

174
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.050
While most people think it means
just simply not interested.

175
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.928
it actually refers to
a lack of bias or being

176
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:55.141
fair and impartial. such
as a disinterested judge

177
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.060
or a disinterested journalist.

178
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.978
Mm. did you fix it?

179
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.105
I did.

180
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.606
Well. you always fix it.

181
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.983
So to be honest. I am rather--

182
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.026
disinterested.

183
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.077
I would think that a
journalist would care

184
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.662
about the English language.

185
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.747
I find it hard to
believe that Moody

186
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.833
Mark could care about anything.

187
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:25.839
Company meeting-- now.

188
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.758
So-- bad news.

189
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.177
Our annual holiday
issue headliner

190
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.179
has fallen into the abyss.

191
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.222
So we need something new.

192
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.348
And we need something fast.

193
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.475
Who's got a lead?

194
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.853
How about a story
on the soup kitchen?

195
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.440
Mm. we aren't just writing
about businesses in peril.

196
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.858
Where's the heart?

197
00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.693
Tell me the story
about the woman

198
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.988
who quits her job. moves
back to her hometown.

199
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.157
crosses paths with her
high school sweetheart who

200
00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.242
volunteers at the
soup kitchen. and now

201
00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.410
they keep it open together.

202
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.703
Now. I want that story.

203
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.459
Really. people. nothing?

204
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.878
Need I remind you. this
is our biggest seller.

205
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.881
This is important to
The Post's bottom line.

206
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.716
You know that new
painting at the Museum

207
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.719
of Modern Art. the one the whole
city has been buzzing about?

208
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.554
Leah found the diary
of the painter.

209
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.766
Oh. well. I'm listening. Leah.

210
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:21.269
What is Christmas about--

211
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:25.023
if not bringing people together?

212
00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:30.028
The year's 1959 in the French
village of Petit Marchand.

213
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:33.907
where local legend has it you're
destined to meet your soulmate.

214
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:37.452
It's a love story
between two young lovers

215
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.704
forbidden from being together.

216
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.165
But under the twinkling
lights of the Marché Noel.

217
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.834
they promise each
other their future.

218
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:48.088
And they make a plan to escape.

219
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.007
And together. they
create this painting

220
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.803
and also a love
that still inspires

221
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:58.431
the public decades later.

222
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.142
So what happened
to them since then?

223
00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.978
Did they ever find their
happily ever after?

224
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.607
That's what I'd
like to find out.

225
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:15.281
Mystery. romance. Christmas--

226
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.867
I love it.

227
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.327
So is this couple
still together?

228
00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.954
I don't know.

229
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.581
But based on. you know. how
he writes about his love.

230
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.582
I'd bet on it.

231
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.918
Well. I hope you're right.

232
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.337
Nobody wants a tragic
ending at Christmas.

233
00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.340
Emilio. start looking at
flights to Petit Marchand.

234
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.508
You're really going for this?

235
00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:34.968
Oh. no. Mark. you are.

236
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.845
Now. you need to get to
France in the morning.

237
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.055
so you better get packing.

238
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:39.973
Uh. what?

239
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:40.807
What?

240
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.274
Hmm. yeah.

241
00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.071
You're assigning me
a Christmas puff piece.

242
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.281
Yes. I am.

243
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.408
I have been on the
ground in refugee camps.

244
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.827
I have covered places other
reporters refused to go.

245
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.663
And you are under
utilizing my skills.

246
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:07.667
Mark. you are the best
reporter that we have here.

247
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.045
You know how to go overseas
and work out a story.

248
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.671
And I need someone
of your caliber

249
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.797
to drive this story home.

250
00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.007
I'm the only one available.

251
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.302
You're the only one available.

252
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.094
Fine.

253
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:18.970
Thank you.

254
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.221
Fine.

255
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.233
Oh. hey. good pitch
back there. Leah.

256
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.694
Will you make sure Mark gets
the journal to take with him?

257
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.365
Actually. I'd like to
talk to you about that.

258
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.699
I want to write the piece.

259
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.868
You're a copy editor.
not a journalist.

260
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.912
Well. no. not-- not yet.

261
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:48.041
Noted. but this is a
big seller for The Post.

262
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.460
Look. I-- I can't assign
a story to someone

263
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.795
who hasn't written for us yet.

264
00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.421
What if I flew myself out?

265
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.340
I could use my vacation days.

266
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.717
This piece is important to me.

267
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.761
I've been reading The
Post my entire life.

268
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.306
And to see my name on the
page would mean the world.

269
00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.641
Give me this chance.

270
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:10.105
And-- technically. the
journal belongs to me.

271
00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.317
OK.

272
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:15.402
OK?

273
00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.986
OK-- yes?

274
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:17.904
Go.

275
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.863
OK.

276
00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.700
Mark. Leah's going with you.

277
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.910
Work with her.

278
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.496
I look forward to
working with you.

279
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.831
No. you don't.

280
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.207
You're right.

281
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.667
But I do look forward
to being in France

282
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.753
and unearthing a
beautiful love story.

283
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.798
Find your
enthusiasm concerning.

284
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.926
The proper word you're
looking for is disconcerting.

285
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:44.848
You're speaking to me concerning
my disconcerting enthusiasm.

286
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.976
Wow. so much fun already.

287
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.609
Never even left
the country before.

288
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.486
What am I supposed to pack?

289
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.280
Does my hair dryer
work in France?

290
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.365
Do they even have
hair dryers in France?

291
00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.284
I mean. they must.
otherwise the French people

292
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.745
are just walking around
with wet hair. which seems--

293
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.790
What?

294
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.833
I'm just proud of you.

295
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.126
That's all.

296
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.628
Finally getting the
shot you deserve.

297
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.964
Thank you.

298
00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.008
Now. the legend says
you meet your soulmate

299
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.094
in this Christmas market. yeah?

300
00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:26.806
So should I plan for a plus
one at Christmas dinner?

301
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.683
If there happens
to be a doctor.

302
00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.018
Who's not too tall.

303
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.603
Right.

304
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.855
ride
in a one horse open sleigh.

305
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.448
Not the sad eyes.

306
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.450
Don't you dare.

307
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.827
I'm only gone a week.

308
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.747
And besides. you get to
hang with Emma next door.

309
00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.499
I know she sneaks you
scraps under the table.

310
00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.502
Come in.

311
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.336
Hi. Mark.

312
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.421
Buddy!

313
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.714
Ahh.

314
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.091
Thanks.

315
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.676
You'll take good care
of my boy. right?

316
00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:03.802
I will.

317
00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.887
We're having spaghetti tonight.

318
00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.347
Wait-- no spaghetti.

319
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.807
Bye.

320
00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.183
Buddy gets special food.

321
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.685
I made enough to last a week.

322
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:03.069
So-- I put together
a strategy so we

323
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.279
can hit the ground running.

324
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:07.449
It's a comprehensive.
multi-point plan.

325
00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.075
Totally.

326
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.494
I was thinking we could
use the journal as our guide

327
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.455
and recreate the activities
that F and Ma Fleur

328
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.790
did the night they met
at Le Marché de Noel.

329
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.584
you know. see things
from their perspective.

330
00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:21.546
discover every little detail
that brought them together.

331
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.881
I scheduled it by day.

332
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.215
Mm-hmm.

333
00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.885
I also scoured the
journal for clues.

334
00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:29.012
That list is here.

335
00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:30.930
There's one thing
I can't figure out.

336
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.101
F mentions that he would
hide notes for Ma Fleur

337
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.187
under a loose stone
behind la glace. which

338
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.814
translates to "behind the ice."
which doesn't even make sense.

339
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.316
Neat.

340
00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.818
Can you at least pretend
like you care about this.

341
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.363
Look. I get all that.

342
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:47.697
Really. I do.

343
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.908
And. um. that's actually
really well put together.

344
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.451
Thank you.

345
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.912
But the way you're going
about it. it makes it seem--

346
00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:56.706
green. new. fresh.

347
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.292
I know what green means.

348
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.670
Besides. I am all
those things. OK?

349
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.925
So how would you approach
it. you know. being so wise

350
00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.510
and. uh. what's the
opposite of green?

351
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.805
Uh. ripe or spoiled?

352
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.139
I prefer to let
go of the plan--

353
00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.517
Wing it.

354
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:19.187
Yeah. uh. winging it
isn't exactly my style.

355
00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.355
Clearly.

356
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.023
Look. in this line
of work. you need

357
00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.234
to develop a skill
for adapting. starting

358
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.528
by adapting to your time zone.

359
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:29.364
We're jetlagged. and you didn't
sleep at all on the plane. so--

360
00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.824
I was too excited
on the plane.

361
00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.951
It was my first flight internationally.

362
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.661
so I couldn't sleep.

363
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.079
You're exhausted.

364
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.831
I'm exhausted.

365
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.082
A journalist who's
falling asleep

366
00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.458
isn't any good to anybody.

367
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:44.838
So let's close our eyes
and get some rest. yeah.

368
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:48.008
OK. so once you have
your beauty sleep.

369
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.010
how do you suggest
we find this couple?

370
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.178
We find what we can online.

371
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.514
And then we go
boots on the ground.

372
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.058
Someone in this town has to know
what happened to the couple.

373
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.102
So we play to the hearts
and minds of the locals.

374
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.520
Hearts and minds?

375
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.354
It's a military term.

376
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.523
We get them working for us.

377
00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.025
Gee. you don't
have any experience

378
00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:06.067
working for the military?

379
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.361
No. but--

380
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.864
I have nothing but respect
and admiration for them.

381
00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:12.449
That was a
rhetorical question.

382
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.200
And I used rhetoric
in my answer.

383
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.166
For the record. la
glace doesn't mean ice.

384
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.542
It means ice cream.

385
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.337
Behind the ice cream
doesn't even make sense.

386
00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.548
Besides. words can have
multiple meanings. you know.

387
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.761
But which one will be
right for this situation?

388
00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.012
Bet it'll be ice cream.

389
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.754
All this Christmas
kitsch. little bit much.

390
00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:08.546
don't you think?

391
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.422
Hmm.

392
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.548
Pere Fouettard.

393
00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.636
Charming.

394
00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.097
You know. there's no
way this F and Ma Fleur

395
00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.640
are still together. eh?

396
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.225
Don't put that out there.

397
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.435
What we say or
do or think now is

398
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.938
it going to change what happened
to this couple of decades ago.

399
00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.816
No. not with that attitude.

400
00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.610
So clearly we have different
approaches to this.

401
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.947
You know. we don't
necessarily have to--

402
00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.990
work side by side on this.

403
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.701
Yeah.

404
00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.953
Yeah. maybe it's more
efficient if we split

405
00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.246
up. do things our own way.

406
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.831
We'd cover more ground.

407
00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.708
Yeah. and I'm sure it'll
be a more pleasant experience

408
00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:45.875
for the both of us.

409
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.461
OK. so where is your first step?

410
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.214
Bed and breakfast.
specifically the bed part.

411
00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.508
Perfect. you can take my bags.

412
00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:54.801
OK.

413
00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.121
Ah. bonjour.

414
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.748
I am Camille.

415
00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:26.207
Welcome to my inn.

416
00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.586
Uh. this is Sophie. [french].

417
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.671
Checking in. monsieur?

418
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.299
Yeah. hi. for Mark
Webber and Leah--

419
00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:38.970
my colleague Leah.

420
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.390
Ah. the American reporters.

421
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.477
You must be very tired
after your long trip. no?

422
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.020
Absolutely exhausted.

423
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.646
Thank you for asking.

424
00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.314
Room three.

425
00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:18.093
Bonjour.

426
00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:24.182
Uh.
chocolate. uh.

427
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.811
hot-- hot chocolate.

428
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.853
Yes. oui. that.

429
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:29.813
Merci.

430
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.111
Oh. chestnuts.

431
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.320
Oh. hot chestnuts.

432
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.738
Yes. oui. merci.

433
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.618
Yeah. sure. whatever that is.

434
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:46.705
Wow. Mark
is really missing out.

435
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.667
No. merci.

436
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.671
Hot chocolate and
roasted chestnuts?

437
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.465
That's a--
very kind

438
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.967
of-- you could just leave--

439
00:20:58.967 --> 00:20:59.968
um. there.

440
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.761
Is it fun being reporter?

441
00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.765
Um. uh. yeah.
sometimes it can be.

442
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.851
I want to be a
reporter when I grow up.

443
00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:08.560
Really?

444
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.813
I'm very observant.

445
00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:12.897
I'll tell you what.

446
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.649
I'll give you your
first mission. OK?

447
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.527
You be my eyes and ears here.

448
00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:22.032
And right now. that
means letting me sleep.

449
00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:28.371
And what if I find
anything important?

450
00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.540
Well. if it's
really important--

451
00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:40.800
you tell me-- later.
way after I wake up.

452
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.843
Yes. sir.

453
00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:42.761
You can count on me.

454
00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:46.806
Au revoir.

455
00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.640
Mm.

456
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.313
Backwards-- uh. excuse me.

457
00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.982
Bonjour. uh. do
you speak English?

458
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:56.858
Yes.

459
00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.068
Yes. OK. good.

460
00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.403
Do you know where the
Hall of Records is?

461
00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:03.365
Oh. [french].

462
00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:04.282
Yes.

463
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:06.743
It burned down in 1977.

464
00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:10.705
Anything prior to that
was lost in the fire.

465
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:11.539
Merci.

466
00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.089
All right.

467
00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:21.966
Why?

468
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:29.557
Hello. Sophie-- again.

469
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:33.186
Sorry to bother you. but
you told me to wake you up

470
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:35.730
if I found anything important.

471
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.608
I don't recall wording
it exactly like that.

472
00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:42.362
I noticed your work partner
still has not arrived.

473
00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:45.365
And that's really
important to you?

474
00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:49.661
It would be if I was in a new
country with another reporter

475
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:53.289
and she had not checked
in for hours and I

476
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.166
cared about her well-being.

477
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:57.127
I did a good job. no?

478
00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:59.045
Yeah. sure.

479
00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.714
Good job. kiddo.

480
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:18.815
Oh.

481
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:20.650
Pardon.

482
00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:25.155
Monsieur!

483
00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:27.115
Oh. pardon.

484
00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:27.907
Pardon.

485
00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.200
There you are.

486
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.409
Come on. Sleeping Beauty.

487
00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:12.744
Let's get you back to the inn.

488
00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:17.165
Yeah. OK.

489
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:19.334
Yeah. come on.

490
00:24:19.334 --> 00:24:21.169
This way.

491
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.961
You all right?

492
00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:28.760
Did you find
your perfectly average height

493
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.178
doctor?

494
00:24:30.178 --> 00:24:33.682
No. but the setting is
perfect. the quaint stalls

495
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:35.475
and the cobblestone streets.

496
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:37.268
MOM
Whoa. who's that?

497
00:24:37.268 --> 00:24:38.561
He's handsome.

498
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:39.729
Oh. Mother.

499
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:40.980
I've got to go. mom.
I love you.

500
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.940
Bye.

501
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:44.901
What's this I hear
about the hunt

502
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:46.778
for an average height doctor?

503
00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:47.654
Bonjour.

504
00:24:49.656 --> 00:24:51.950
Would you like a
pain au chocolate?

505
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.119
Some coffee for
me. please. Camille.

506
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:55.286
Yeah. mine was delicious.

507
00:24:55.286 --> 00:24:56.913
Thank you. Camille.

508
00:24:56.913 --> 00:25:00.041
I see you've left no gifts
for the gnomes last night.

509
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:03.086
Mm. no. we have not.

510
00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:04.421
Should we have?

511
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:07.465
If you don't leave
any gifts. the gnomes.

512
00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:09.300
they will play tricks on you.

513
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.594
What kind of gifts
should we leave?

514
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:16.099
Chocolates or toys. a macaron.

515
00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.351
Just leave it outside your
bedroom door at night.

516
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:23.440
And. um. these gnomes. do
they give good luck as well?

517
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.984
If they're feeling friendly.

518
00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:28.737
OK. that's about
enough of that.

519
00:25:28.737 --> 00:25:29.863
We should get to work.

520
00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:31.614
Yes. uh. thank
you for breakfast.

521
00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:33.616
Camille. and you too Sophie.

522
00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:35.952
Oh. uh. one more thing.

523
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:40.290
What is the most common
meaning of la glace?

524
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.166
Ice.

525
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:42.292
Ice cream.

526
00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:52.385
So I already looked
at the Hall of Records.

527
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:53.386
That's a dead end.

528
00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:54.596
Burned down before 1977.

529
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:56.014
Wait. how
did you know that?

530
00:25:56.014 --> 00:25:58.058
Well. you were running
yourself ragged yesterday.

531
00:25:58.058 --> 00:26:00.143
I got some rest and
simply looked it

532
00:26:00.143 --> 00:26:01.644
up online. because
you could just

533
00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:03.438
Google things like a reporter.

534
00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:06.524
OK. but maybe the records
are archived regionally.

535
00:26:06.524 --> 00:26:09.069
Nope. I already checked.

536
00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:10.820
Uh. what else is
there on your agenda?

537
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:19.496
Look. um. I know
I said yesterday

538
00:26:19.496 --> 00:26:21.039
that we should work separately.

539
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:28.505
But-- you are more experienced.
so maybe there's a thing

540
00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:30.340
or two I could learn from you.

541
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.761
Well. that was very brave. yet
embarrassing of you to admit.

542
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:37.597
I respect it.

543
00:26:37.597 --> 00:26:39.641
All right. well.
don't make me regret it.

544
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:40.684
Where will we start?

545
00:26:40.684 --> 00:26:42.894
With the tangible clues.

546
00:26:42.894 --> 00:26:44.646
Let me see the music box.

547
00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:48.566
F hired a woodworker to custom
make this for Ma Fleur. right?

548
00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:50.110
And there's a symbol
here on the top.

549
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.820
If we can figure
out what this means.

550
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.238
maybe we can get
somewhere with the story.

551
00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.823
I'm guessing you
already googled it.

552
00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:56.366
Hey. you're learning.

553
00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:58.034
Well done.

554
00:26:58.034 --> 00:27:00.203
Unfortunately. there's
nothing available online.

555
00:27:00.203 --> 00:27:02.080
I had the tech department
at The Post run

556
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.832
some photo recognition
software on it.

557
00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:06.084
which turned up exactly
nothing. which is why we are

558
00:27:06.084 --> 00:27:07.335
starting with an interview--

559
00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:09.170
here.

560
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.424
This is your first one. so
you let me do the talking.

561
00:27:12.424 --> 00:27:13.508
I'll show you how it's done.

562
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:28.690
Bonjour. monsieur. I-- [french].

563
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.192
Oui. I certainly do.

564
00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:33.361
Always happy for a chance
to practice my English.

565
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:35.155
Well. that's lucky
for you. because. uh.

566
00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:38.199
my Francais is. uh.
pretty terrible.

567
00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:39.868
So hi. I'm Mark.

568
00:27:39.868 --> 00:27:40.744
This is Leah.

569
00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:41.745
Bonjour.

570
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.204
Your work is beautiful.

571
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:44.372
Merci.

572
00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:45.582
Bernard Du Bois.

573
00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.208
Welcome to [french].

574
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:52.047
Um. so this-- this. uh.
box was made here in Petit

575
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:55.342
Marchand sometime in the 1950s.

576
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.509
Do you recognize it?

577
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:58.720
Do you know anything about it?

578
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.891
Excellent-- um. artisinal--

579
00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:03.975
the English escapes me--

580
00:28:03.975 --> 00:28:05.977
Uh. craftsmanship.

581
00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:08.772
Oui. voila. merci.

582
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:13.068
But. um. I cannot tell you much.

583
00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:16.738
This symbol is likely the mark
of the woodworker who made it.

584
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:20.408
But not ones that I recognize.

585
00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:27.582
Hmm. um. do the names F and
Ma Fleur mean anything to you?

586
00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:28.667
I apologize.

587
00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.752
I cannot be of more. um-- um--

588
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.879
[french].

589
00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:34.422
Aid-- aid.

590
00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:36.257
You're apologizing for not
being able to help more.

591
00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:37.342
Help.

592
00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:38.760
Help. merci
beaucoup. mademoiselle.

593
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.678
Thank you.

594
00:28:39.678 --> 00:28:41.262
Oh. uh. one more thing.

595
00:28:41.262 --> 00:28:43.306
Do you believe in the
legend that you're

596
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:46.559
destined to meet your
soulmate at the Marché Noel?

597
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.270
I have seen many
people fall in love here.

598
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.775
My parents fell in love at
Le Marché Noel. my brother.

599
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:54.943
I haven't found my love yet.

600
00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:57.570
But I believe she's on her way.

601
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.948
I'm always late. so it makes
sense that she would be too.

602
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:02.826
All right. time to go.

603
00:29:02.826 --> 00:29:04.411
Merci.

604
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.120
Thank you so much. Bernard.
Nice to meet you.

605
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.829
Bye.

606
00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:06.663
Au revoir.

607
00:29:12.252 --> 00:29:16.506
So-- that's how it's done. huh?

608
00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:19.175
Every lead we check
off is a step closer.

609
00:29:19.175 --> 00:29:20.385
Mm-hmm.

610
00:29:20.385 --> 00:29:21.636
Well. it seems like
there might be something

611
00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:22.679
to this legend after all.

612
00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:24.180
People do fall in love here.

613
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.474
Hmm. and how much tourism
does that little legend

614
00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:28.018
bring to town?

615
00:29:28.018 --> 00:29:29.978
I'm sure they're all very
happy to perpetuate it.

616
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:31.479
Was that an act back there?

617
00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:33.815
Do you just pretend to be
charming to get your way?

618
00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:37.318
No. I am charming.
just when it suits me.

619
00:29:37.318 --> 00:29:38.069
Ah.

620
00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:41.406
There's a difference.

621
00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:44.659
OK. if you say so.

622
00:29:53.126 --> 00:29:55.003
This music box.
do you recognize it?

623
00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:56.254
Do you know anything about it?

624
00:29:56.254 --> 00:29:57.922
We work in a newspaper.

625
00:29:57.922 --> 00:29:59.966
And we are writing an
article about le marché.

626
00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:00.967
No. no. no.

627
00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:02.135
We're not looking to buy.

628
00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:03.261
We're. uh. journalists.

629
00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:05.055
Actually.
we were wondering

630
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:06.514
if we could ask you a few
questions about your shop.

631
00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:09.392
We're looking for a
loose stone below la glace.

632
00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:11.436
Can you tell us
anything about. uh. the--

633
00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:13.021
We were hoping
we could ask you

634
00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:14.189
a few questions about your--

635
00:30:14.189 --> 00:30:15.899
May we ask
you a few questions?

636
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:18.610
Do you mind if
I take a look around?

637
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.070
Look. I know you're the pro.

638
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.697
But how do you feel about
switching strategies?

639
00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:24.407
Hey. you know what?

640
00:30:24.407 --> 00:30:26.701
You think you could do better
than established protocol--

641
00:30:26.701 --> 00:30:27.786
be my guest.

642
00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:28.661
Really?

643
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:29.746
Really.

644
00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:30.789
And you'll go along with it?

645
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:32.999
I will go along with it.

646
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:34.292
Great.
You won't regret it.

647
00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:35.251
You might actually
have some fun.

648
00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:38.963
So I'm thinking we go
back to our original plan.

649
00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:41.299
do what F and Ma Fleur
did the night they met.

650
00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:42.926
see things from
their perspective.

651
00:30:42.926 --> 00:30:47.097
I really think if we
can recreate the night.

652
00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:52.185
you know. that perfect moment.
we can unlock the story.

653
00:30:52.185 --> 00:30:53.728
Cool. I'm glad you're on board.

654
00:30:53.728 --> 00:30:56.690
Hmm.

655
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.441
Bonjour.

656
00:30:58.441 --> 00:31:01.486
So F and Ma Fleur met when he
was dancing with his friends

657
00:31:01.486 --> 00:31:02.612
by the musicians.

658
00:31:02.612 --> 00:31:05.865
And she walked by.
and he accidentally

659
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:07.826
knocked a pomme d'amour
out of her hand.

660
00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:08.910
Pomme d'amour?

661
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.370
Apple of love.

662
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.372
That's what they call
candied apples here.

663
00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:13.289
Cute.

664
00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:13.915
I know.

665
00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:14.791
Do you want one?

666
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:16.459
No.

667
00:31:16.459 --> 00:31:17.252
One. please.

668
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:20.922
Merci.

669
00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:23.299
OK. so now you--

670
00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:24.801
uh. you go and dance.

671
00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:27.512
And when I walk by. you
knock this out of my hand.

672
00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:30.890
You said you'd
go along with this.

673
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.850
OK.

674
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.268
Go. OK.

675
00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:34.978
OK.

676
00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:42.944
Come on.

677
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:44.320
I know you can bust a move.

678
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.699
Just-- OK. what kind
of dance do you know?

679
00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:50.285
I danced ballroom--

680
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:52.078
briefly in high school.

681
00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:53.705
I will not explain further.

682
00:31:53.705 --> 00:32:00.628
OK. uh. then ballroom and
knock this out of my hand.

683
00:32:00.628 --> 00:32:01.671
OK.

684
00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:12.182
Tourists.

685
00:32:12.182 --> 00:32:13.558
- We should go.
- We should go right now.

686
00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:14.142
Yeah. let's go.

687
00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:16.144
Let's just go.

688
00:32:16.144 --> 00:32:19.189
So that was the perfect
moment. a candied apple.

689
00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:20.565
Not just.

690
00:32:20.565 --> 00:32:23.360
They-- went on a walk
after meeting to get

691
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.652
to know each other better.

692
00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:27.447
And then they shared
their first kiss--

693
00:32:27.447 --> 00:32:29.866
in front of the big tree.

694
00:32:29.866 --> 00:32:30.742
It's beautiful.

695
00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:33.078
It's a tree.

696
00:32:33.078 --> 00:32:35.246
What's your deal
with Christmas?

697
00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:36.873
What do you mean?

698
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:39.334
Any time anyone brings up
anything about Christmas.

699
00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:41.086
you get all pessimistic.

700
00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:44.339
And not just like neutral. you
become such a downer about it.

701
00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:45.715
There's something
going on there.

702
00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:50.011
You know what?

703
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:51.513
I'm going to turn
this around for you.

704
00:32:51.513 --> 00:32:52.889
I have faith.

705
00:32:52.889 --> 00:32:56.017
OK. this is our perfect moment.

706
00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:57.143
Dip me.

707
00:32:57.143 --> 00:32:58.603
Why?

708
00:32:58.603 --> 00:33:00.355
F dipped Ma Fleur in
front of the big tree

709
00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:02.482
and then they shared
their first kiss.

710
00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:03.274
So dip me.

711
00:33:03.274 --> 00:33:06.111
No kiss necessary.

712
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:08.321
Do I have to make fun of
your ballroom dancing?

713
00:33:08.321 --> 00:33:10.573
Do I have to make fun of
your quest for a short doctor?

714
00:33:10.573 --> 00:33:13.410
Average-- I said
average height.

715
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.161
Come on.

716
00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:16.871
Get to dipping.

717
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.754
OK.

718
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:35.890
That's the symbol.

719
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:49.029
See?

720
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.863
I told you.

721
00:33:49.863 --> 00:33:51.156
It worked.

722
00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:53.491
It's the same
woodworker symbol.

723
00:33:53.491 --> 00:33:56.202
Whomever made this stand must
have custom made the music

724
00:33:56.202 --> 00:33:58.371
box for our painter. right?

725
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:02.792
Exactly. except it's
whoever. not whomever.

726
00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:04.961
Subject-pronoun.
not object-pronoun.

727
00:34:04.961 --> 00:34:07.547
Um. I'm going to take
the lead on this one.

728
00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:10.675
I found the clues that
brought us here. so-- bonjour.

729
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:15.972
Bonjour-- oh. what a
cute couple you two are.

730
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:18.850
.. I have the perfect
cookie for the perfect night.

731
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.852
Tell me your names. I'll
make one special for you.

732
00:34:20.852 --> 00:34:22.687
Yes. except we
are not together.

733
00:34:22.687 --> 00:34:24.606
I mean. we are
technically together

734
00:34:24.606 --> 00:34:26.399
as we are here together.

735
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.151
But we are not a couple--

736
00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:29.361
coworkers.

737
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:30.737
Coworkers. [french].

738
00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:32.906
I can see the Marché
Noel at work here.

739
00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:34.657
perhaps more than
coworkers soon enough.

740
00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:36.868
Right. so we work
at a newspaper.

741
00:34:36.868 --> 00:34:39.162
And we are writing an
article about the market.

742
00:34:39.162 --> 00:34:41.414
May we ask you a few questions?

743
00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.083
.. I
would love to help.

744
00:34:43.083 --> 00:34:46.419
But Christmas is our busiest
time of the year at the bakery.

745
00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:47.921
I'm afraid I'm out of time.

746
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:50.090
Just like a few little
seconds. s'il vous plait.

747
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.716
Madam. [french].

748
00:34:51.716 --> 00:34:53.176
As you can see. it's crowded.

749
00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:54.260
There's so many people.

750
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.387
I cannot do this.

751
00:34:55.387 --> 00:34:57.806
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:57.806 --> 00:35:00.183
I love that big
one in the back.

753
00:35:00.183 --> 00:35:02.018
Could you personalize it for us?

754
00:35:02.018 --> 00:35:03.770
Leah and Mark with a K.

755
00:35:05.105 --> 00:35:07.440
Mark with a K. right away.

756
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.235
Ah. say. mate. how long
has this stand been around?

757
00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:13.113
Oh. we've had the
bakery since just

758
00:35:13.113 --> 00:35:14.781
after the Second World War.

759
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:18.034
Been in my family since my
grandfather built the stand.

760
00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:19.536
He built it himself.

761
00:35:19.536 --> 00:35:20.662
That's impressive.

762
00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:22.789
Oh. he was an impressive man.

763
00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:25.709
Baker. wood worker.
carpenter. you know. he

764
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:27.961
loved working with his hands.

765
00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:32.090
And this symbol up here. can
you us anything about that?

766
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.552
And here you are Mark
with a K. Sorry. very busy.

767
00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:37.220
That'll be 8 euros.

768
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.764
You know. we--

769
00:35:39.764 --> 00:35:41.641
we forgot to get one
for Sophie at the inn.

770
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:42.851
Yes.

771
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:44.102
Can we get another
one for Sophie. please?

772
00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:45.812
Right away. sir. Sophie.

773
00:35:47.647 --> 00:35:52.819
symbol. it was actually
my grandfather's trademark.

774
00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:55.321
He was the best in town. you
know. like creme de la creme

775
00:35:57.073 --> 00:35:59.200
That's how people knew
they were buying quality.

776
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.246
Here you are.

777
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.665
Oh. actually. you know what?

778
00:36:05.665 --> 00:36:07.500
That one in the back
is-- looks really good.

779
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.087
Um. and your grandfather.
did he put that symbol

780
00:36:11.087 --> 00:36:12.130
on everything that he made?

781
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.840
Oh. yes. he did.

782
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.176
Grandpere would have the
recipients name on everything

783
00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.344
he sold for them to find.

784
00:36:17.344 --> 00:36:19.346
That was his little
game. you know.

785
00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:23.058
If he made a gift for you. he
would a hidden mark with a K.

786
00:36:23.058 --> 00:36:24.351
You know what?

787
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:27.062
We'll take this
whole row right here.

788
00:36:28.855 --> 00:36:30.648
Your grandfather. he didn't--
he didn't keep sales records.

789
00:36:30.648 --> 00:36:32.025
did he?
- Oh. no.

790
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.151
All gone years ago.

791
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:37.280
Um. that'll be 75 euros.

792
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.907
Oh. wow.

793
00:36:38.907 --> 00:36:40.367
It's so nice to meet you.
Thank you.

794
00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:41.201
Yes. thank--

795
00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:43.370
Pay the man.

796
00:36:45.747 --> 00:36:47.207
You know what's funny--

797
00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:51.628
snow. the cobblestone
streets. your doctor--

798
00:36:51.628 --> 00:36:53.421
reminds me of this
kid's book my mom used

799
00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.215
to read me when I was little.

800
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:57.342
The Doctor and the Maid.

801
00:36:57.342 --> 00:36:58.885
You know it.

802
00:36:58.885 --> 00:37:01.554
Yeah. it's my favorite book.

803
00:37:01.554 --> 00:37:04.808
Yeah. it was my
mom's favorite too.

804
00:37:04.808 --> 00:37:07.519
Huh.

805
00:38:06.953 --> 00:38:13.084
So it took me a while to
find. but do you remember.

806
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:16.629
he said his grandfather would
engrave the name of the person

807
00:38:16.629 --> 00:38:18.465
the piece was made for.

808
00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:22.469
And so-- voila.

809
00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:25.388
Ava Auclair. our Ma Fleur.

810
00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:26.931
Well done.

811
00:38:26.931 --> 00:38:28.058
Thank you.

812
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.976
And just like you.
I used the internet.

813
00:38:29.976 --> 00:38:32.395
And according to
recent census records.

814
00:38:32.395 --> 00:38:34.814
there are no Auclairs is
currently living in town.

815
00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:40.445
But I did find this--

816
00:38:40.445 --> 00:38:46.910
a photograph labeled Ava
Auclair Petit Marchand 1955.

817
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.995
Photographer uncredited.

818
00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:51.581
You did good.

819
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:53.375
Well-- I--

820
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.626
I did well.

821
00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:57.337
Uh-- good is an adjective.

822
00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:59.297
Well is an adverb.

823
00:38:59.297 --> 00:39:01.508
Just take the compliment.

824
00:39:01.508 --> 00:39:03.343
Good-- I did good.

825
00:39:03.343 --> 00:39:05.428
Thank you.

826
00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:06.930
Voila.

827
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.723
And for you. Leah?

828
00:39:08.723 --> 00:39:11.810
Uh. a croissant au
chocolate. s'il vous plait.

829
00:39:15.897 --> 00:39:19.609
So do you see the
townhome in the picture?

830
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:21.778
It's a much less
abstract version

831
00:39:21.778 --> 00:39:23.405
of the one in the painting.

832
00:39:23.405 --> 00:39:28.034
It looks like the townhomes
by the cathedral. the street

833
00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:30.370
with all the Christmas lights.

834
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.454
Thank you. Sophie.

835
00:39:31.454 --> 00:39:33.081
That's actually very helpful.

836
00:39:33.081 --> 00:39:36.251
Observant. sign
of a good reporter.

837
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:37.043
Merci.

838
00:39:38.294 --> 00:39:41.131
In France. we have
chocolate for breakfast.

839
00:39:46.845 --> 00:39:48.638
There's salt. That's salt.

840
00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:53.059
Those silly gnomes.

841
00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:56.396
I'm guessing you didn't
leave any gift for them.

842
00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:57.272
Hmm.

843
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.157
It's like this
building doesn't exist.

844
00:40:07.157 --> 00:40:09.701
I mean. none of
them quite line up.

845
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:11.911
Yeah. and we've been
on it all afternoon.

846
00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:14.372
So at what point do we just say
it's a dead end and move on?

847
00:40:14.372 --> 00:40:15.457
You know what?

848
00:40:15.457 --> 00:40:17.751
Maybe the journal might help.

849
00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:19.502
Let's see.

850
00:40:19.502 --> 00:40:24.716
So on the second day of the
market. the two young lovers--

851
00:40:24.716 --> 00:40:26.968
rode a horse-drawn carriage--

852
00:40:27.927 --> 00:40:29.262
to see the Christmas lights.

853
00:40:29.262 --> 00:40:30.055
What do you say?

854
00:40:30.055 --> 00:40:31.097
Worked for us last night?

855
00:40:31.097 --> 00:40:32.766
No. last night was pure luck.

856
00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:34.768
And. uh. I think we checked
every house in the area.

857
00:40:34.768 --> 00:40:36.019
It's not going to
magically change

858
00:40:36.019 --> 00:40:37.312
if we take a carriage ride.

859
00:40:38.605 --> 00:40:40.565
Pere Noel. Santa Claus.

860
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:41.649
La Pere Fouettard.

861
00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:42.442
Oh. oh.

862
00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:43.443
Oh. whoa.

863
00:40:44.694 --> 00:40:46.196
Ow. why do these
kids keep kicking me?

864
00:40:46.196 --> 00:40:46.863
We should go.

865
00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:54.454
Well. it isn't exactly
a horse-drawn carriage.

866
00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:55.955
but it'll do.

867
00:40:55.955 --> 00:40:58.667
At least I can practice
my. uh. princess wave.

868
00:40:59.626 --> 00:41:00.669
Like a homecoming queen.

869
00:41:02.253 --> 00:41:04.047
Yeah. well. my mom wanted
me to be homecoming queen.

870
00:41:04.047 --> 00:41:06.216
Imagine her disappointment
when I ended up doing Model UN.

871
00:41:06.925 --> 00:41:07.759
Nerd.
- Hey.

872
00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:09.219
No.

873
00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:10.845
No. no. no. I'm only
saying that because you

874
00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:14.307
are talking to a delegate
Mark Webber UN Ambassador

875
00:41:14.307 --> 00:41:15.183
to the United Kingdom.

876
00:41:15.183 --> 00:41:15.809
Hey. there.

877
00:41:15.809 --> 00:41:17.435
How you doing?

878
00:41:17.435 --> 00:41:19.187
I went to a national
conference. did a whole speech

879
00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:21.064
on nuclear non-proliferation.

880
00:41:21.064 --> 00:41:24.067
Got ripped to shreds.

881
00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:26.653
Nuclear non-proliferation
was my subject.

882
00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:28.738
Hmm. and I knew
you were a nerd.

883
00:41:28.738 --> 00:41:30.573
I didn't know that you
were my kind of nerd.

884
00:41:33.118 --> 00:41:35.495
I could see how this
setting would be romantic--

885
00:41:35.495 --> 00:41:37.205
under different circumstances.

886
00:41:37.205 --> 00:41:40.166
Oh. different as
in with a handsome

887
00:41:40.166 --> 00:41:44.337
doctor instead of your grumpy
but charming co-worker?

888
00:41:44.337 --> 00:41:46.089
Ideally.

889
00:41:46.089 --> 00:41:49.009
So you're-- you're pretty sold
on the whole love story thing.

890
00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:51.094
Do you mind if I ask
where that comes from?

891
00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:55.015
Uh. my dad passed
away when I was a kid.

892
00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:58.018
You know. and he left my
mom with five children

893
00:41:58.018 --> 00:42:00.729
under the age of nine. which
was really hard for her

894
00:42:00.729 --> 00:42:03.189
and really tough on us.

895
00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:04.232
Sorry.

896
00:42:04.232 --> 00:42:05.483
Thank you.

897
00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:07.068
Uh. but he's the reason
I believe in true love.

898
00:42:07.068 --> 00:42:09.195
the way my mom talks about him.

899
00:42:09.195 --> 00:42:11.031
But they never got
their happy ending.

900
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:15.910
So-- I guess I've always
been looking for it.

901
00:42:18.163 --> 00:42:19.289
Have you ever been in love?

902
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.377
Once.

903
00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:25.503
Didn't work out.

904
00:42:25.503 --> 00:42:26.296
Why not?

905
00:42:28.923 --> 00:42:31.301
I always wanted a big family.

906
00:42:31.301 --> 00:42:32.302
She didn't.

907
00:42:32.302 --> 00:42:34.054
Put an expiration
date on things.

908
00:42:34.054 --> 00:42:35.889
I always kind of
pictured you as a loner.

909
00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:37.432
Well. full of surprises.

910
00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.726
Yeah.

911
00:42:39.726 --> 00:42:40.727
Hey. excuse me. sir.

912
00:42:40.727 --> 00:42:41.561
Stop the trolley.

913
00:42:51.029 --> 00:42:53.782
Wait. show me the picture.

914
00:42:53.782 --> 00:42:54.908
That's it. right?

915
00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:56.326
That's the door.

916
00:42:56.326 --> 00:42:59.329
Yes. well done.
Delegate Webber.

917
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.218
Bonjour. [french].

918
00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:14.803
Hi. my name is Mark.

919
00:43:14.803 --> 00:43:15.595
This is Leah.

920
00:43:15.595 --> 00:43:16.596
Bonjour.

921
00:43:16.596 --> 00:43:18.014
They call me Marguerite.

922
00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:19.933
We were hoping we
could ask a few questions

923
00:43:19.933 --> 00:43:21.768
about your lovely town home.

924
00:43:23.478 --> 00:43:25.146
I'm not interested in selling.
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.189
Oh. no. no.

926
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:27.357
We're not looking to buy.

927
00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:29.234
We're journalists from the US.

928
00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:32.195
Journalists. how intriguing.

929
00:43:32.195 --> 00:43:34.531
But it's a very busy
time for me. I'm afraid.

930
00:43:34.531 --> 00:43:36.658
I'm in the middle of
wrapping Christmas gifts

931
00:43:36.658 --> 00:43:37.826
for my nieces and nephews.

932
00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:38.785
Oh.

933
00:43:38.785 --> 00:43:39.744
And there are many--

934
00:43:39.744 --> 00:43:41.788
so many.

935
00:43:41.788 --> 00:43:43.289
au revoir.

936
00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:46.126
I'm actually really
great at wrapping gifts.

937
00:43:46.126 --> 00:43:47.293
And we would be happy to help.

938
00:43:47.293 --> 00:43:49.796
Wouldn't we. Mark?

939
00:43:49.796 --> 00:43:51.089
I love it.

940
00:43:51.089 --> 00:43:52.882
It's my favorite pastime.

941
00:43:52.882 --> 00:43:53.717
So kind.

942
00:43:53.717 --> 00:43:54.843
So generous.

943
00:43:54.843 --> 00:43:58.430
Uh. come in.

944
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.806
Come in.

945
00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:00.807
Hearts and minds.

946
00:44:00.807 --> 00:44:03.393
OK.

947
00:44:03.393 --> 00:44:05.228
I'm one of six children.

948
00:44:05.228 --> 00:44:08.606
And they have all decided
to make many little babies.

949
00:44:08.606 --> 00:44:11.693
I'm the oldest of
five. so I get it.

950
00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:14.738
So tell me. what
brings two beautiful.

951
00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:17.991
fancy American reporters all
the way to my petite maison?

952
00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:23.580
Oh. well. a photograph of a
girl in front of this townhome.

953
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.499
Do you happen to know
anything about Ava Auclair?

954
00:44:26.499 --> 00:44:27.334
Mais oui.

955
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:28.752
Oui?

956
00:44:28.752 --> 00:44:30.712
My parents bought this
home from a family Auclair

957
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:31.921
a long time ago.

958
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:34.299
I was not here yet.
a star in heaven

959
00:44:34.299 --> 00:44:37.427
waiting to make my entrance.

960
00:44:37.427 --> 00:44:41.139
Um. and. uh. did your parents
happen to mention anything

961
00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:43.016
about the Auclairs to you?

962
00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.477
Not much.

963
00:44:45.477 --> 00:44:48.146
I only know that they
used to own the ice

964
00:44:48.146 --> 00:44:51.024
cream shop in town. La Glacier.

965
00:44:51.024 --> 00:44:53.068
Ice cream shop.

966
00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:54.486
Mm-hmm.

967
00:44:54.486 --> 00:44:56.029
Because that's what
I heard was ice cream.

968
00:44:56.029 --> 00:44:57.030
I just want to--
seems like it was--

969
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.906
Yes.

970
00:44:57.906 --> 00:44:59.199
important.

971
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:00.533
Do you mind if I
take a look around?

972
00:45:00.533 --> 00:45:01.534
Oh. feel free.

973
00:45:01.534 --> 00:45:02.994
Thanks.

974
00:45:02.994 --> 00:45:04.746
Each item was acquired
over a lifetime of holidays.

975
00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:11.419
Is there anything left in
the house from the Auclairs?

976
00:45:11.419 --> 00:45:14.089
I cannot imagine anything
but the walls. the windows.

977
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:15.590
the floors beneath us.

978
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:20.387
Do you believe in
the legend. Marguerite.

979
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:23.181
that you're destined
to meet your soulmate

980
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:24.099
at the Marché de Noel?

981
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:31.523
For me. it is not real.

982
00:45:31.523 --> 00:45:33.441
Every year. I sat on
the bench in the middle

983
00:45:33.441 --> 00:45:36.778
of Le Marché waiting
for my Prince Charming

984
00:45:36.778 --> 00:45:39.572
to whisk me away.

985
00:45:39.572 --> 00:45:42.117
He never did.

986
00:45:42.117 --> 00:45:43.660
I haven't been in years.

987
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.832
Perhaps Le Marché and
perhaps love are not for me.

988
00:45:48.832 --> 00:45:53.503
But what if your prince
is just around the corner?

989
00:45:53.503 --> 00:45:57.090
You shouldn't give up on love.
especially around Christmas.

990
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.384
Apologies. Marguerite.

991
00:45:59.384 --> 00:46:02.762
Leah has a very idealistic
view of romance.

992
00:46:02.762 --> 00:46:08.018
Oh. my darling. so do
I. Even as a little girl.

993
00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:12.147
I imagined that my love. mon
amour. lived in this house.

994
00:46:12.147 --> 00:46:13.690
here.

995
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.278
And that-- this was my
house just over the bridge.

996
00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:19.779
Oh. well. there's
your problem.

997
00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:22.032
The bridge isn't big enough
to go over the water.

998
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.785
Mm-hmm. I have had many
bridges over the years--

999
00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:29.622
too big. too small. no.
not quite the right size.

1000
00:46:29.622 --> 00:46:32.751
I actually think I know
someone who can help you.

1001
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.383
What?

1002
00:46:40.383 --> 00:46:43.178
You are full of surprises.

1003
00:46:43.178 --> 00:46:45.221
OK. I told you.

1004
00:46:45.221 --> 00:46:47.640
So what did F and
Ma Fleur do next?

1005
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.144
I'm not sure how to
explain it. but I admit.

1006
00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:53.021
your strategy has
been working for us.

1007
00:46:53.021 --> 00:46:57.817
OK. uh. well. after the
boat. they danced to the music

1008
00:46:57.817 --> 00:46:59.861
of the street musicians.

1009
00:46:59.861 --> 00:47:00.945
Am I going to regret this?

1010
00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:03.490
Come on.

1011
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.116
Let's put your ballroom
moves to good use.

1012
00:47:13.166 --> 00:47:17.837
It was nice of you to. um.
set up Marguerite and Bernard.

1013
00:47:17.837 --> 00:47:19.714
Eh. she needed a bridge.

1014
00:47:19.714 --> 00:47:22.300
Hmm. come on.
now. Mark Webber.

1015
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.343
Don't deny it.

1016
00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:24.678
You knew what you were doing.

1017
00:47:24.678 --> 00:47:26.221
Well. maybe.

1018
00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:32.018
Maybe your positivity might
actually be rubbing off on me.

1019
00:47:32.018 --> 00:47:34.979
Believe it or not. I did get
into journalism to help people.

1020
00:47:34.979 --> 00:47:36.481
Really?

1021
00:47:36.481 --> 00:47:39.067
Is it that hard to believe
that Moody Mark might

1022
00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:41.778
actually care about something?

1023
00:47:41.778 --> 00:47:43.947
Yeah. don't worry.

1024
00:47:43.947 --> 00:47:46.032
I know people call me that.

1025
00:47:46.032 --> 00:47:48.910
In fact. I started it
so everyone would leave

1026
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.037
me alone and let me write.

1027
00:47:51.037 --> 00:47:52.080
Interesting tactic.

1028
00:47:54.457 --> 00:47:55.625
OK.
- Mm-hmm.

1029
00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:56.251
OK.

1030
00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:57.127
Mm-hmm.

1031
00:47:57.127 --> 00:47:58.044
All right.

1032
00:48:03.717 --> 00:48:05.719
I spent a lot of
time over the years

1033
00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:07.387
telling stories for
people who aren't

1034
00:48:07.387 --> 00:48:10.932
capable of telling their own.

1035
00:48:10.932 --> 00:48:13.226
After all that. coming
back to the office.

1036
00:48:13.226 --> 00:48:17.564
I guess. small talk.
it felt superficial.

1037
00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:20.525
So I became Moody Mark.

1038
00:48:20.525 --> 00:48:22.819
People don't bother Moody Mark.

1039
00:48:22.819 --> 00:48:26.156
They let me come
and go. do my work.

1040
00:48:26.156 --> 00:48:29.325
It's easier that way.

1041
00:48:29.325 --> 00:48:33.163
Yeah. I could see how
a puff piece like this

1042
00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:34.956
would feel frivolous
in comparison.

1043
00:48:34.956 --> 00:48:36.666
But for me. it was
beautiful stories

1044
00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:39.085
like these that kept me going.

1045
00:48:39.085 --> 00:48:43.631
When my mom was working. I
would tell my younger siblings

1046
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:48.011
uplifting stories from The Post.
especially around Christmas.

1047
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:52.057
I've seen firsthand how a
little joy and a little hope

1048
00:48:52.057 --> 00:48:54.976
can make a difference
in someone's life.

1049
00:48:54.976 --> 00:48:57.979
Kind of always dreamed of having
my name printed next to them.

1050
00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:04.903
My parents divorced when I was
young and I was an only child.

1051
00:49:04.903 --> 00:49:07.572
I always wondered what Christmas
would be like for a big family.

1052
00:49:07.572 --> 00:49:10.450
Well. it may be a
shock to your system.

1053
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.286
but you're always
welcome to ours.

1054
00:49:13.286 --> 00:49:14.621
I'm hosting this year.

1055
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:16.623
OK. I just might
take you up on that.

1056
00:49:16.623 --> 00:49:17.791
OK.

1057
00:49:24.297 --> 00:49:26.341
We should. uh--

1058
00:49:26.341 --> 00:49:27.759
I mean. it's getting
late so we should go--

1059
00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:28.343
Yeah.

1060
00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:29.344
rest.

1061
00:49:29.344 --> 00:49:31.012
Yeah. yeah. after you.

1062
00:49:31.012 --> 00:49:31.846
Hmm.

1063
00:49:48.488 --> 00:49:49.239
For the gnomes.

1064
00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:57.330
Good night.

1065
00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:03.169
Leah. good night.

1066
00:50:03.169 --> 00:50:06.172
Good night.

1067
00:50:24.733 --> 00:50:29.362
Why does your
face look like that?

1068
00:50:29.362 --> 00:50:31.364
Shouldn't you be at sleep?

1069
00:50:31.364 --> 00:50:32.866
I'm French.

1070
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:33.700
I stay up late.

1071
00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:40.582
Tell me. Sophie. why do you
want to be a reporter anyway?

1072
00:50:40.582 --> 00:50:43.668
I like to know why things
are the way they are.

1073
00:50:43.668 --> 00:50:45.670
And I like to ask questions.

1074
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.090
You know. that's actually
a really good strategy.

1075
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.636
You ask why until you
can't ask why anymore.

1076
00:50:53.636 --> 00:50:57.515
And then you've gotten to
the bottom of the story.

1077
00:50:57.515 --> 00:51:00.685
You remind me of me
when I was a kid.

1078
00:51:00.685 --> 00:51:02.645
I liked to ask
annoying questions too.

1079
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:06.483
And now you don't like anything.

1080
00:51:09.235 --> 00:51:11.488
Touché.

1081
00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:13.573
Thanks for the cookie
with my name by the way.

1082
00:51:13.573 --> 00:51:14.657
It wasn't me.

1083
00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:16.659
Leah said it was.

1084
00:51:16.659 --> 00:51:17.744
Leah's wrong.

1085
00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:20.663
Leah's nice and beautiful. no?

1086
00:51:20.663 --> 00:51:23.041
OK. goodnight. Sophie.

1087
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:26.211
You should leave
gifts for the gnomes.

1088
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:28.171
Maybe they can help you.

1089
00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:29.714
Good night. Sophie.

1090
00:51:45.063 --> 00:51:46.356
Did you see Samantha's email?

1091
00:51:46.356 --> 00:51:47.732
She wants to know if
we have anything yet.

1092
00:51:47.732 --> 00:51:48.733
What do we tell her?

1093
00:51:48.733 --> 00:51:49.984
Don't worry about Samantha.

1094
00:51:49.984 --> 00:51:51.403
She's like this
on every article.

1095
00:51:51.403 --> 00:51:52.404
We're fine.

1096
00:51:52.404 --> 00:51:53.238
We're on the right track.

1097
00:51:53.238 --> 00:51:54.989
Voila.

1098
00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:56.700
Oh. chocolate croissant?

1099
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.617
Oui.

1100
00:51:57.617 --> 00:52:00.286
Mark ordered it for you.

1101
00:52:00.286 --> 00:52:02.580
In France. we eat chocolate
for breakfast. right?

1102
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.249
- Yeah.
- And nothing for me. Camille.

1103
00:52:04.249 --> 00:52:05.667
Thank you.

1104
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:07.419
Wouldn't want the gnomes
to play another trick

1105
00:52:07.419 --> 00:52:09.087
on me this morning.

1106
00:52:09.087 --> 00:52:12.590
Mm. OK. I know you usually
only have coffee for breakfast.

1107
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:13.591
but you need to try this.

1108
00:52:13.591 --> 00:52:14.759
It's delicious.

1109
00:52:14.759 --> 00:52:16.261
I'm good. thank you.

1110
00:52:16.261 --> 00:52:17.554
But I--

1111
00:52:17.554 --> 00:52:19.222
Yeah. I know you
thrive on being no fun.

1112
00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:21.099
Just try it.

1113
00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:22.434
Trust me. just got to try it.

1114
00:52:22.434 --> 00:52:23.268
OK.

1115
00:52:23.268 --> 00:52:25.145
Yeah.

1116
00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:27.397
Mm.

1117
00:52:27.397 --> 00:52:29.399
Oh. wow.

1118
00:52:29.399 --> 00:52:31.192
Oh. wow. that is good.

1119
00:52:31.192 --> 00:52:35.947
Sophie. I'm going to need like
two or three dozen more of--

1120
00:52:35.947 --> 00:52:37.282
See. I knew you'd like it.

1121
00:52:37.282 --> 00:52:38.450
Come on.

1122
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.118
Let's go for hot chocolates.

1123
00:52:40.118 --> 00:52:42.120
OK.

1124
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:48.418
Not the gnomes.

1125
00:52:48.418 --> 00:52:49.502
How did they find me?

1126
00:52:59.763 --> 00:53:01.306
Ooh.

1127
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:04.434
Do you think the ice
cream shop has pastries too?

1128
00:53:04.434 --> 00:53:05.393
Yeah.

1129
00:53:05.393 --> 00:53:08.772
Yeah. I would think so.

1130
00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:14.611
Shh.

1131
00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:16.279
Why do kids keep
saying that to me?

1132
00:53:16.279 --> 00:53:16.905
I don't know.

1133
00:53:16.905 --> 00:53:17.989
It's weird.

1134
00:53:17.989 --> 00:53:18.782
Hmm.

1135
00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:19.616
Thank you.

1136
00:53:25.163 --> 00:53:26.039
Hello.

1137
00:53:26.039 --> 00:53:28.667
Bonjour.

1138
00:53:28.667 --> 00:53:31.836
Some ice cream. or a crepe.
or perhaps a hot chocolate?

1139
00:53:31.836 --> 00:53:33.171
I will have a hot chocolate.

1140
00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:33.797
Make it two.

1141
00:53:33.797 --> 00:53:35.173
OK.

1142
00:53:35.173 --> 00:53:38.093
Sounds good.

1143
00:53:38.093 --> 00:53:41.262
Actually. we had some
questions about your shop.

1144
00:53:41.262 --> 00:53:43.056
if you don't mind.

1145
00:53:43.056 --> 00:53:44.474
No. we don't mind at all.

1146
00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:46.393
It would be a pleasure.

1147
00:53:46.393 --> 00:53:49.104
Can you tell us anything
about the Auclairs?

1148
00:53:49.104 --> 00:53:51.523
They used to own
the shop previously.

1149
00:53:51.523 --> 00:53:56.486
Oh. that was so long ago.

1150
00:53:56.486 --> 00:53:58.571
They were nice people. I recall.

1151
00:53:58.571 --> 00:54:02.826
I believe they moved
away from Petit Marchand.

1152
00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:04.911
Beyond that. I don't know.

1153
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:09.374
Did you ever know their
daughter. Ava Auclair?

1154
00:54:09.374 --> 00:54:10.667
Uh-uh.

1155
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:11.501
I did not.

1156
00:54:11.501 --> 00:54:12.627
No. no.

1157
00:54:12.627 --> 00:54:14.045
But that takes me back.

1158
00:54:14.045 --> 00:54:15.714
Do you remember. Vivian?

1159
00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:18.717
We were young and newly married
when we bought this shop.

1160
00:54:20.218 --> 00:54:23.388
We fell in love right
there at Le Marché Noel.

1161
00:54:23.388 --> 00:54:28.727
And we wanted so desperately
to own a piece of the town.

1162
00:54:28.727 --> 00:54:33.732
Between everyone here. you all
believe in legend of the town?

1163
00:54:33.732 --> 00:54:36.151
We have a first-hand
account right here.

1164
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:38.111
What else do you need?

1165
00:54:38.111 --> 00:54:41.406
Pierre and I had been
at school together.

1166
00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:43.783
He was-- how you say--

1167
00:54:43.783 --> 00:54:45.994
bookish?

1168
00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:48.872
And I was a bit wild.

1169
00:54:48.872 --> 00:54:51.082
I never gave him a glance.

1170
00:54:51.082 --> 00:54:55.628
She was intimidating
for a quiet boy like me.

1171
00:54:55.628 --> 00:54:59.090
And it was there
at the market.

1172
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.093
He was working the pretzel
stand for his uncle.

1173
00:55:02.093 --> 00:55:06.765
And I saw him in
a different light.

1174
00:55:06.765 --> 00:55:07.891
The magic of the market.

1175
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:09.768
Mm.

1176
00:55:09.768 --> 00:55:13.063
Is it magic though?

1177
00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:16.608
Uh. who's to say you
wouldn't have met and fallen

1178
00:55:16.608 --> 00:55:18.693
in love someplace else?

1179
00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:20.320
I believe there is magic.

1180
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.949
Or maybe there's.
um. a placebo effect.

1181
00:55:24.949 --> 00:55:26.659
If you expect to
meet your partner.

1182
00:55:26.659 --> 00:55:29.537
the odds of it happening go up.

1183
00:55:29.537 --> 00:55:32.791
Placebo or not. we
are all very happy.

1184
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:37.295
Well. absolutely
no argument there.

1185
00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:39.756
Thank you so much for your
time and this delicious hot

1186
00:55:39.756 --> 00:55:41.466
chocolate.

1187
00:55:41.466 --> 00:55:44.969
But before we go. since la glace
means ice cream-- and we all

1188
00:55:44.969 --> 00:55:47.472
know la glace means ice cream--

1189
00:55:47.472 --> 00:55:51.851
we're looking for a loose
stone below la glace.

1190
00:55:51.851 --> 00:55:53.687
Does that mean anything to you?

1191
00:55:53.687 --> 00:55:54.562
No.

1192
00:55:54.562 --> 00:55:56.106
No. I'm afraid not.

1193
00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.859
Bummer.

1194
00:56:03.863 --> 00:56:06.449
So what do you think?

1195
00:56:06.449 --> 00:56:09.285
Is this legend still
a publicity stunt?

1196
00:56:09.285 --> 00:56:12.831
Hmm. they seem
like the real deal.

1197
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:14.582
I think you may be
cracking. Mark Webber.

1198
00:56:14.582 --> 00:56:15.917
What is that?

1199
00:56:15.917 --> 00:56:17.711
Is that a way out of
this conversation?

1200
00:56:22.716 --> 00:56:24.968
Hold on.

1201
00:56:24.968 --> 00:56:26.970
This is La Pere Fouettard.

1202
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.596
This is what these
kids keep calling me.

1203
00:56:28.596 --> 00:56:30.807
I guess so.

1204
00:56:30.807 --> 00:56:33.268
What even is La
Pere Fouettard?

1205
00:56:33.268 --> 00:56:38.148
In France. he is known
for accompanying Santa and--

1206
00:56:38.148 --> 00:56:42.527
dispensing whippings
to naughty children.

1207
00:56:42.527 --> 00:56:44.029
Come on.

1208
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:45.655
I mean. you kind
of give off a vibe.

1209
00:56:45.655 --> 00:56:50.952
There is-- a vast difference
between Moody Mark and. uh.

1210
00:56:50.952 --> 00:56:51.911
whatever that is.

1211
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:54.080
Here. try the cloak on.

1212
00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:54.998
Do you mind?

1213
00:56:54.998 --> 00:56:56.082
Thank you.

1214
00:56:59.919 --> 00:57:00.837
Huh?

1215
00:57:00.837 --> 00:57:01.588
You got to like--

1216
00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:03.214
Huh?

1217
00:57:03.214 --> 00:57:04.090
You got to just--

1218
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:05.133
It's way different.

1219
00:57:05.133 --> 00:57:07.052
Do the-- do the--

1220
00:57:07.052 --> 00:57:07.802
yeah. you're right.

1221
00:57:07.802 --> 00:57:08.720
I don't see it.

1222
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.721
Children!

1223
00:57:09.721 --> 00:57:10.638
Children. Pere Fouettard!

1224
00:57:10.638 --> 00:57:11.556
Pere Fouettard!

1225
00:57:13.475 --> 00:57:14.851
Ow. oh.

1226
00:57:14.851 --> 00:57:16.561
Ow.

1227
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:18.772
You better be nice or you're
all getting coal this year.

1228
00:57:18.772 --> 00:57:20.023
Ah. oh. OK.

1229
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:21.066
Oh. we got to go.

1230
00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:22.400
Oh. we need to go right now.

1231
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.234
Oh. excuse me.

1232
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:31.785
Ow.

1233
00:57:31.785 --> 00:57:34.829
Ah. tourista.

1234
00:57:45.924 --> 00:57:51.346
So OK. it's. uh. right here.
outside of this cathedral.

1235
00:57:51.346 --> 00:57:53.264
after knowing each other
for only three days.

1236
00:57:53.264 --> 00:57:55.517
that F proposed to Ma Fleur.

1237
00:57:55.517 --> 00:57:56.601
Three days.

1238
00:57:56.601 --> 00:57:58.019
You don't think
that's a little quick?

1239
00:57:58.019 --> 00:57:59.354
What?

1240
00:57:59.354 --> 00:58:00.772
Do you have a
timeline on true love?

1241
00:58:00.772 --> 00:58:02.315
When you know. you know.

1242
00:58:02.315 --> 00:58:06.695
No. I think true love takes
time. trust. pragmatism.

1243
00:58:06.695 --> 00:58:11.616
Ah. yes. the key to every
woman's heart-- pragmatism.

1244
00:58:11.616 --> 00:58:13.743
So I'm not proposing
to you. for the record.

1245
00:58:13.743 --> 00:58:14.577
Understood.

1246
00:58:14.577 --> 00:58:16.287
And agreed.

1247
00:58:16.287 --> 00:58:18.373
When I get proposed to.
I want it to be for real.

1248
00:58:18.373 --> 00:58:20.750
Hmm.

1249
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:22.544
So what's next?

1250
00:58:22.544 --> 00:58:24.212
Well. to celebrate
their engagement.

1251
00:58:24.212 --> 00:58:25.213
they rode the carousel.

1252
00:58:25.213 --> 00:58:27.757
But we could just skip that.

1253
00:58:27.757 --> 00:58:30.301
That's it?

1254
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:32.262
You-- you have made me
do every activity so far.

1255
00:58:32.262 --> 00:58:33.930
And you don't want
to go to a carousel.

1256
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:37.058
Well. you're generally pretty
opposed to the concept of fun.

1257
00:58:37.058 --> 00:58:38.309
So we could just let it go.

1258
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:40.562
No. absolutely not.

1259
00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:42.981
What would you possibly
have against carousels?

1260
00:58:42.981 --> 00:58:45.108
I just get terrible
motion sickness.

1261
00:58:45.108 --> 00:58:47.861
And I don't love horses.

1262
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:50.405
Didn't the doctor ride a horse
in The Doctor and The Maid?

1263
00:58:50.405 --> 00:58:52.115
You got to face
that fear sometime.

1264
00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:53.533
Come on.

1265
00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:56.745
Maybe it'll lead to
a. uh. perfect moment.

1266
00:58:56.745 --> 00:58:57.537
Come on.

1267
00:58:57.537 --> 00:58:58.955
Let's go.

1268
00:59:01.624 --> 00:59:05.170
OK. I guess you've been a good
sport. so it goes both ways.

1269
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.921
I think so.

1270
00:59:06.921 --> 00:59:07.797
Hello.

1271
00:59:07.797 --> 00:59:08.715
Hello. bonjour.

1272
00:59:08.715 --> 00:59:09.341
Can we ride?

1273
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:10.925
Ah. oui. monsieur.

1274
00:59:10.925 --> 00:59:12.761
After you.

1275
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:14.929
Excellent choice.

1276
00:59:14.929 --> 00:59:17.599
Thank you.

1277
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:19.267
Oh. OK.

1278
00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:22.187
Ah. OK. wow.

1279
00:59:22.187 --> 00:59:23.021
Wow.

1280
00:59:26.399 --> 00:59:27.400
This is actually fun.

1281
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.444
Thank you for the extra push.

1282
00:59:29.444 --> 00:59:32.405
Hey. you have been making me
do things around town all week.

1283
00:59:32.405 --> 00:59:34.991
Figure now we're even.

1284
00:59:34.991 --> 00:59:36.159
Fair enough.

1285
00:59:36.159 --> 00:59:37.786
You can have this one.

1286
00:59:37.786 --> 00:59:39.287
Oh-- oh. what?

1287
00:59:39.287 --> 00:59:42.040
Was that can I have this one?

1288
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.541
You may have this one.

1289
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:48.046
Ah. the student
becomes the master.

1290
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:52.258
You OK?

1291
00:59:52.258 --> 00:59:54.177
Merci.

1292
00:59:56.805 --> 00:59:58.181
OK.

1293
00:59:58.181 --> 01:00:00.809
Whoo.

1294
01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:02.477
So what next?

1295
01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:06.606
Uh. well. F gave Ma Fleur
an ornament as a placeholder

1296
01:00:06.606 --> 01:00:08.316
until he could get a ring.

1297
01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.486
OK. so the
ornaments stand then?

1298
01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:12.320
Yes.

1299
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.154
Let's go.

1300
01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:14.698
Yes.

1301
01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:17.826
Oh. this reminds me of my mom.

1302
01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:18.993
She's big into crafting.

1303
01:00:18.993 --> 01:00:19.828
Oh. yeah?

1304
01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:20.829
Mm-hmm.

1305
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:21.913
What would she craft?

1306
01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:23.665
Everything.

1307
01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:28.294
Um. jewelry. journals.
dolls. sock monkeys.

1308
01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:30.046
She would take us to
thrift stores as children

1309
01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:33.049
and help us sew beads and
patches on our clothes

1310
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:35.343
to make them our own.

1311
01:00:35.343 --> 01:00:37.012
I used to think
that she was just

1312
01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.972
encouraging our creativity.

1313
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.057
But then. when I got
older. I realized she was

1314
01:00:41.057 --> 01:00:43.101
struggling to pay the bills.

1315
01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:46.021
Anything she could DIY. she did.

1316
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:47.480
She sounds incredible.

1317
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.898
Yeah. she is.

1318
01:00:48.898 --> 01:00:49.899
Don't let me fool you.

1319
01:00:49.899 --> 01:00:50.859
She's a spitfire.

1320
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:55.363
Ah. we'll take this--

1321
01:00:55.363 --> 01:00:56.906
for your mother.

1322
01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:59.826
And this as well.

1323
01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:01.578
Should make the
gnomes happy for once.

1324
01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:08.335
Merci.

1325
01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:11.296
Thank you.

1326
01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:12.380
She'll love that.

1327
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.131
You're welcome.

1328
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:15.967
Thanks.

1329
01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:17.010
It's pretty.

1330
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.576
Help a guy out. gnomes.

1331
01:01:57.884 --> 01:01:58.677
Hmm.

1332
01:02:11.147 --> 01:02:13.441
Thanks for meeting me here.

1333
01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:15.193
Well. you look festive.

1334
01:02:15.193 --> 01:02:16.569
Thanks.

1335
01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:18.071
Trying to get these
kids to lay off me.

1336
01:02:18.071 --> 01:02:20.031
Not sure how much more
my shins can take.

1337
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:22.492
Well. I like it.

1338
01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:24.786
So uh. F and Ma
Fleur decided to meet

1339
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:28.498
here at midnight to exchange
vows before running away.

1340
01:02:28.498 --> 01:02:31.084
And then he was
planning on giving

1341
01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:35.380
her his gifts. that painting
and the music box. that night.

1342
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.508
But that is where
the journal ends.

1343
01:02:38.508 --> 01:02:40.468
Well. everything's been
leading here it seems.

1344
01:02:40.468 --> 01:02:42.178
I guess so.

1345
01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:45.140
No pressure. right?

1346
01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.349
La Pere Fouettard!

1347
01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:52.689
You OK?

1348
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:53.314
Yeah.

1349
01:02:57.485 --> 01:03:02.323
Wow. this is amazing.

1350
01:03:02.323 --> 01:03:07.620
Everything in the US was built
like yesterday in comparison.

1351
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.080
Sometimes I
forget you're seeing

1352
01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.373
this all for the first time.

1353
01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:11.541
Really?

1354
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:14.627
No. you remind me constantly.

1355
01:03:14.627 --> 01:03:17.922
Well. I'm still green. right?

1356
01:03:17.922 --> 01:03:20.592
Maybe not as
much as I thought.

1357
01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:25.263
I'll admit I doubted you
pretty much at every step

1358
01:03:25.263 --> 01:03:26.765
right from the start.

1359
01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:29.809
But kind of hard to argue
with your results so--

1360
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:34.481
so you tell me. where
do we go from here?

1361
01:03:36.066 --> 01:03:38.735
Well. there has to be
something in this cathedral.

1362
01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:42.489
right. something that could
help us break this story?

1363
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:43.323
Mm.

1364
01:03:48.244 --> 01:03:49.245
What does la glace mean?

1365
01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:56.378
Just-- just do it.

1366
01:03:56.378 --> 01:03:58.254
I think we all know
it means ice cream.

1367
01:03:58.254 --> 01:03:59.089
Yes.

1368
01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:02.008
And--

1369
01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:03.301
Oh. ice. wow.

1370
01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:04.094
And--

1371
01:04:06.346 --> 01:04:07.097
Mirror.

1372
01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:14.312
Below the mirror.

1373
01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:47.679
Can I help you?

1374
01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:49.639
Um. actually. yes.

1375
01:04:49.639 --> 01:04:52.350
Yes. I was wondering
if you could

1376
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:58.314
answer some questions for me
about the nativity over there.

1377
01:04:58.314 --> 01:04:59.232
Yes.

1378
01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:00.066
Yeah?

1379
01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:01.359
Yes. great.

1380
01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.028
We'll just be a second. honey.

1381
01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:04.946
Why don't you light
a candle for me.

1382
01:05:04.946 --> 01:05:06.072
- Got it.
- Thank you.

1383
01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:06.948
Mm-hmm.

1384
01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:20.128
Uh. so I--

1385
01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:23.631
I was hoping that you could
tell me who these people are.

1386
01:05:23.631 --> 01:05:24.716
- Yes.
- Obviously that's--

1387
01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:25.633
Yes.

1388
01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:26.968
Mary and baby Jesus.

1389
01:05:26.968 --> 01:05:29.637
Oui. and Joseph [french].

1390
01:05:29.637 --> 01:05:32.265
Oh. yeah.

1391
01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:37.479
And-- oh. uh. and
who is-- who is this?

1392
01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:39.064
Uh. that's a shepherd. Madam.

1393
01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:46.946
And what's--
what's he got there?

1394
01:05:46.946 --> 01:05:48.406
That's a sheep. Madam.

1395
01:05:48.406 --> 01:05:49.616
Mm. fascinating.

1396
01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:53.787
And. uh. what--
what's. uh. this?

1397
01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:55.163
This is another sheep.

1398
01:05:55.163 --> 01:05:56.081
Mm. mm-hmm.

1399
01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:06.466
And. uh. that guy in the
back over there. that's--

1400
01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:07.550
That's a wiseman.

1401
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:10.637
Oh. yeah. and--

1402
01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:14.849
To my love.
Ma Fleur. never showed up.

1403
01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.810
Waited for hours.

1404
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.770
Broke my heart.

1405
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.648
Forever yours. F.

1406
01:06:36.621 --> 01:06:38.248
Yeah. and then.
obviously. that is--

1407
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.165
Joseph.

1408
01:06:39.165 --> 01:06:39.958
Yep.

1409
01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:42.419
Hey. honey. are you--

1410
01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:43.294
you ready to hang out?

1411
01:06:43.294 --> 01:06:44.045
Yes.

1412
01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:47.841
Uh. thank you so much.

1413
01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:51.594
Uh. yeah. very informative.

1414
01:06:51.594 --> 01:06:53.596
I've learned--
I've learned a lot.

1415
01:06:53.596 --> 01:06:54.472
Merci.

1416
01:06:54.472 --> 01:06:56.516
Um. joyeux noel.

1417
01:06:56.516 --> 01:06:58.852
Joyeux noel.

1418
01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:01.521
So did you find it?

1419
01:07:01.521 --> 01:07:02.897
Yeah.

1420
01:07:02.897 --> 01:07:05.066
See. I knew it was
the right way to go.

1421
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:08.194
Leah. I have some bad news.

1422
01:07:08.194 --> 01:07:09.362
Bad news. what?

1423
01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:10.155
Was it stuck?

1424
01:07:12.782 --> 01:07:15.285
Was it empty?

1425
01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.704
Yeah.

1426
01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:19.748
Yeah. it was empty.

1427
01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:21.666
Sorry.

1428
01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:23.376
Well. OK.

1429
01:07:23.376 --> 01:07:24.878
Well. that doesn't necessarily
mean anything though. right?

1430
01:07:24.878 --> 01:07:26.296
They would have gotten
rid of it eventually.

1431
01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:28.548
And we can just
find something else.

1432
01:07:28.548 --> 01:07:30.216
That's all.

1433
01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:31.051
Yeah. I'm not sure we're
going to find what we're looking

1434
01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:32.677
for in the next few hours.

1435
01:07:32.677 --> 01:07:35.221
Yeah. but we haven't exhausted
all of our resources yet.

1436
01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:37.682
I mean. we can talk
to some more people.

1437
01:07:37.682 --> 01:07:39.392
Somebody's going
to know something.

1438
01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:45.815
Maybe-- maybe our time
is better spent regrouping.

1439
01:07:45.815 --> 01:07:48.234
Uh. well. I'm not going
to give up on their love

1440
01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:51.029
that easily. especially not now.

1441
01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:56.910
OK. look. I'm gonna go
find something else.

1442
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.703
You can come with me or not.

1443
01:08:01.623 --> 01:08:04.834
I'm gonna head
back to the inn.

1444
01:08:04.834 --> 01:08:08.546
see if there's
something I can salvage.

1445
01:08:08.546 --> 01:08:10.256
Great.

1446
01:08:10.256 --> 01:08:11.883
Go team.

1447
01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:24.396
I appreciate you
letting me stop by.

1448
01:08:24.396 --> 01:08:26.898
Well. I had no idea there
was so much in the attic.

1449
01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:29.567
Oh. thank you for
letting me look through it.

1450
01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:30.985
Mm. my pleasure.

1451
01:08:30.985 --> 01:08:32.320
So take your time.

1452
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.738
And if you need
me. I'm upstairs.

1453
01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:34.864
- OK.
- OK?

1454
01:08:34.864 --> 01:08:35.824
Thank you.

1455
01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:36.700
Merci.

1456
01:08:41.663 --> 01:08:43.707
That's a new face.

1457
01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:46.084
I don't like it.

1458
01:08:46.084 --> 01:08:49.421
Yeah. well. I
don't think we're

1459
01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.923
going to find the happy
ending we've been looking for.

1460
01:08:51.923 --> 01:08:53.925
Maybe I can help.

1461
01:08:53.925 --> 01:08:56.261
I'll investigate.

1462
01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.806
Why won't you find
your happy ending?

1463
01:08:59.806 --> 01:09:03.226
It says it right here.

1464
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:06.187
Ava stood him up.
broke his heart.

1465
01:09:06.187 --> 01:09:08.815
He waited for hours.
but she never showed up.

1466
01:09:08.815 --> 01:09:12.318
So he wrote her a letter on
the last page of his journal.

1467
01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:13.820
left it for her
to find. pleading

1468
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.946
for her to change her mind.

1469
01:09:14.946 --> 01:09:18.658
But-- she never came.

1470
01:09:18.658 --> 01:09:21.077
Hmm. why?

1471
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:25.665
Probably because
she realized it'd

1472
01:09:25.665 --> 01:09:28.001
be ridiculous for two
teenagers to run away

1473
01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:30.086
together after just a few days.

1474
01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:35.300
But-- it would have been
a really good story.

1475
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.385
Why?

1476
01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:40.597
Everyone loves a
love story. right?

1477
01:09:40.597 --> 01:09:43.975
I think Leah would have
written it really well.

1478
01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:45.935
I see.

1479
01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:48.229
Why?

1480
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:51.608
I just know how much
she cares about it.

1481
01:09:51.608 --> 01:09:55.612
She believed this couple
was together so much she

1482
01:09:55.612 --> 01:09:57.197
almost had me believing it.

1483
01:09:57.197 --> 01:10:00.200
She must be really
sad they broke up then.

1484
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.869
I haven't told her yet.

1485
01:10:02.869 --> 01:10:04.746
I haven't had the heart to.

1486
01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:06.164
She put so much
faith in the magic

1487
01:10:06.164 --> 01:10:09.084
of this town and true love.

1488
01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:14.255
I guess I didn't want
to break her heart.

1489
01:10:14.255 --> 01:10:15.131
And why?

1490
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:34.442
Hmm.

1491
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.780
Kind of hard to
write a feel-good story

1492
01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.783
without a feel-good ending.

1493
01:11:23.783 --> 01:11:25.577
How about you?

1494
01:11:25.577 --> 01:11:27.954
Will the find anything.
use your magic?

1495
01:11:27.954 --> 01:11:31.041
Yes. about that--

1496
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:34.294
the name Philip
makes the F sound.

1497
01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:38.673
So maybe they eloped and
then got married later.

1498
01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:45.221
This is a British
Army uniform.

1499
01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:46.389
His last name is Bancroft.

1500
01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.308
Our painter's French.

1501
01:11:48.308 --> 01:11:50.226
Yeah. but maybe they moved to
the UK and he changed his name.

1502
01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.395
OK. I think it's time to
start being realistic here.

1503
01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:54.856
We're talking
about two teenagers

1504
01:11:54.856 --> 01:11:56.232
from half a century ago.

1505
01:11:56.232 --> 01:11:57.776
Yeah. my parents got
married as teenagers.

1506
01:11:57.776 --> 01:12:00.695
And they'd still be
together if he hadn't--

1507
01:12:00.695 --> 01:12:02.989
look. I'm sure we have
a contact in London. OK?

1508
01:12:02.989 --> 01:12:03.990
We can find them.

1509
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.617
I'll call Samantha.

1510
01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:08.995
Leah. it's not him.

1511
01:12:08.995 --> 01:12:10.538
They didn't elope.

1512
01:12:10.538 --> 01:12:12.040
They didn't end up
together at all.

1513
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.708
And I'm sorry.

1514
01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:16.670
I really-- I shouldn't have
let you take it this far.

1515
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:17.545
Let me?

1516
01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:23.760
I found the missing
pages to the journal.

1517
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.263
F wrote Ava a letter
and left it for her.

1518
01:12:27.263 --> 01:12:28.390
She stood him up.

1519
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.937
Where was this?

1520
01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:36.022
I found it in the church.

1521
01:12:37.023 --> 01:12:40.026
But you said it was empty.

1522
01:12:40.026 --> 01:12:41.986
You were so
enthusiastic about it.

1523
01:12:41.986 --> 01:12:43.279
I-- I didn't want
to mess that up.

1524
01:12:43.279 --> 01:12:44.197
I thought maybe--

1525
01:12:44.197 --> 01:12:46.700
So you just lied to me?

1526
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.576
You know that I'm a
journalist. right?

1527
01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.829
And more than anything.
I want the truth.

1528
01:12:50.829 --> 01:12:53.164
God. it feels like we have
been on a magical scavenger

1529
01:12:53.164 --> 01:12:54.708
hunt for the last week.

1530
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:57.961
We are chasing some impossible
dream instead of seeing

1531
01:12:57.961 --> 01:12:59.629
what is right in front of us.

1532
01:12:59.629 --> 01:13:01.881
OK. what's in front of me is
a jaded reporter who'd rather

1533
01:13:01.881 --> 01:13:03.883
be dishonest than helpful.

1534
01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:05.593
Look. I knew you were moody. OK?

1535
01:13:05.593 --> 01:13:07.929
But I just-- I didn't think
you were manipulative.

1536
01:13:07.929 --> 01:13:08.763
OK.

1537
01:13:11.307 --> 01:13:13.101
I'm the senior reporter
here and I should have

1538
01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.310
reeled this in a long time ago.

1539
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:15.562
So I'm calling it now.

1540
01:13:15.562 --> 01:13:18.023
It is time to pack
up and go home.

1541
01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:19.399
Great. so you're
just quitting?

1542
01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:20.942
Better than sitting
around and waiting

1543
01:13:20.942 --> 01:13:24.612
for something that is literally
never going to happen.

1544
01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:26.114
You want to be a
good reporter. Leah?

1545
01:13:26.114 --> 01:13:27.198
Here's a tip.

1546
01:13:27.198 --> 01:13:29.993
Expect the worst.

1547
01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:31.661
It's always the worst.

1548
01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:50.513
What are you looking at?

1549
01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:55.643
What are you all looking at?

1550
01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:57.979
There's no need to yell.

1551
01:13:57.979 --> 01:14:00.482
We're are right here.

1552
01:14:00.482 --> 01:14:02.359
Now's not the time. Sophie.

1553
01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:03.777
It's not Sophie.

1554
01:14:03.777 --> 01:14:06.988
It's the gnomes.

1555
01:14:06.988 --> 01:14:09.783
That's enough. Sophie.

1556
01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:13.912
I'm tired of games.
tired of fairy tales.

1557
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:16.664
It's over. gnome.

1558
01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:20.085
It's only over
if you say it over.

1559
01:14:20.085 --> 01:14:26.049
If you stop now. you're not even
giving a happy ending a chance.

1560
01:14:26.049 --> 01:14:31.930
That is actually pretty
insightful. for a gnome.

1561
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:33.139
It was me the whole time.

1562
01:14:33.139 --> 01:14:34.015
Oh. wow.

1563
01:14:34.015 --> 01:14:36.893
No way.

1564
01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:41.356
As your. uh. girl reporter
here in Petit Marchand.

1565
01:14:41.356 --> 01:14:42.691
I noticed something.

1566
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:46.027
You and Leah make a good team.

1567
01:14:46.027 --> 01:14:49.406
And you smile more
when you're with her.

1568
01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.240
You're right.

1569
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.867
Leah and me--

1570
01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:57.706
Leah and I. we do
make a good team.

1571
01:14:57.706 --> 01:15:00.709
And I do smile more
when I'm with her.

1572
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:03.878
You're going to be a pretty
good reporter one day.

1573
01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:05.296
I'll tell you what.

1574
01:15:05.296 --> 01:15:08.299
When you're older. I
know an editor in Paris.

1575
01:15:08.299 --> 01:15:09.926
And I'll set you up
with an internship

1576
01:15:09.926 --> 01:15:11.469
if you're interested.

1577
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.399
How did you do that?

1578
01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:26.609
Do what?

1579
01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.903
Move the music box
when I wasn't looking.

1580
01:15:28.903 --> 01:15:30.989
How did you do that?

1581
01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:33.533
I didn't.

1582
01:15:33.533 --> 01:15:35.785
The gnomes!

1583
01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:38.204
They're trying to
tell you something.

1584
01:15:45.545 --> 01:15:46.588
Excuse me.

1585
01:15:53.178 --> 01:15:54.804
Hi. mom.

1586
01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:58.224
I just wanted to show you
the market before I leave.

1587
01:15:58.224 --> 01:16:00.310
It's beautiful. sweetie.

1588
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.854
Hey. did you find your
mysterious couple?

1589
01:16:02.854 --> 01:16:05.231
LEAH
No. mom. I failed.

1590
01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:09.402
I wanted to will myself into
finding something perfect.

1591
01:16:09.402 --> 01:16:12.322
you know. find like a beautiful
love like what you and dad had.

1592
01:16:12.322 --> 01:16:15.283
And it turns out there's
nothing out there.

1593
01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:18.495
MOM
Uh. oh. sweetie. I

1594
01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:20.330
may have exaggerated
our love story

1595
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.999
for you kids just a little bit.

1596
01:16:22.999 --> 01:16:26.795
I mean. it made me happy to
tell you stories about him

1597
01:16:26.795 --> 01:16:28.755
and. I don't know.
have you seen him

1598
01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:30.840
as some larger-than-life
character.

1599
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.803
But we had problems just
like any other couple.

1600
01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:35.762
Really?

1601
01:16:35.762 --> 01:16:37.138
Really.

1602
01:16:37.138 --> 01:16:40.058
And we fought from time to time.

1603
01:16:40.058 --> 01:16:44.813
And it took years to
get over certain things.

1604
01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:48.483
And after all these
years without him.

1605
01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:50.360
it's the great memories
that are strongest.

1606
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.028
But it's all still there--

1607
01:16:52.028 --> 01:16:53.113
the good and the bad.

1608
01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:54.406
And isn't that great?

1609
01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:57.367
Because who needs
a fairy tale when

1610
01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:58.702
you can have something real?

1611
01:17:03.665 --> 01:17:05.500
Hey. everything's shaking.

1612
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.712
Where are you going?

1613
01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:10.213
To find something real.

1614
01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:55.300
Sorry I lied to you.

1615
01:18:01.514 --> 01:18:04.684
You are a good reporter.

1616
01:18:04.684 --> 01:18:09.939
And we would not have gotten
nearly as far without you.

1617
01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:15.779
This job has-- has worn
me down over the years.

1618
01:18:15.779 --> 01:18:18.031
Working with you has actually
been really refreshing.

1619
01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:22.285
I think I got so
used to being Moody

1620
01:18:22.285 --> 01:18:25.205
Mark. shutting people
out. that I forgot what

1621
01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:26.664
it was like to let them in.

1622
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.211
I have been happier this
past week than I have

1623
01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:33.296
been in a really long time.

1624
01:18:33.296 --> 01:18:36.508
And that's because of you.

1625
01:18:36.508 --> 01:18:38.760
So thank you.

1626
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.388
I think I'm finally ready
to let go of Moody Mark.

1627
01:18:43.932 --> 01:18:48.228
Wow. that was very brave.
yet very embarrassing

1628
01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:49.062
of you to admit.

1629
01:18:53.608 --> 01:18:56.736
We wouldn't have gotten
anywhere without you.

1630
01:18:56.736 --> 01:19:00.865
And I shouldn't have clung
so tightly to some ideal

1631
01:19:00.865 --> 01:19:03.827
when it clearly wasn't
helping us anymore.

1632
01:19:03.827 --> 01:19:06.246
I just-- I spent so long
looking for something

1633
01:19:06.246 --> 01:19:08.748
perfect that I was--

1634
01:19:08.748 --> 01:19:11.001
blind to what was real.

1635
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:15.672
So thank you for showing
me how to do the job.

1636
01:19:20.135 --> 01:19:22.012
Sorry you won't get
your name in The Post.

1637
01:19:24.472 --> 01:19:26.725
Yeah. that's OK.

1638
01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:28.685
You know. I don't have to
wait till another journal

1639
01:19:28.685 --> 01:19:31.104
falls into my lap to try again.

1640
01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:33.815
You know. a very
wise gnome told

1641
01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:35.775
me once upon a time--
and please. follow

1642
01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:36.985
my train of thought here.

1643
01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:38.236
Mm-hmm.

1644
01:19:38.236 --> 01:19:40.864
It's not over until
you decide it's over.

1645
01:19:43.908 --> 01:19:47.078
I think the magic
of Le Marché de Noel

1646
01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:48.955
might be rubbing
off on me after all.

1647
01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:58.548
I had Bernard fix it for you.

1648
01:20:12.854 --> 01:20:14.272
I know who the painter is.

1649
01:20:22.322 --> 01:20:25.408
There's a painting that's been
the talk of the city lately.

1650
01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:26.910
You know the one.

1651
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.703
And our journey
to find the artist

1652
01:20:28.703 --> 01:20:30.580
didn't quite go as planned.

1653
01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.791
But not much in life does.

1654
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:36.044
We eventually did track
down the mysterious F.

1655
01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:40.507
also known as Francois Renard.

1656
01:20:40.507 --> 01:20:44.427
And his grand plan to elope
with Ma Fleur. Ava Auclair.

1657
01:20:44.427 --> 01:20:49.474
the subject of his painting.
ended in heartbreak.

1658
01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:52.102
She stood him up that night.

1659
01:20:52.102 --> 01:20:55.522
Francois wrote her a letter and
left it in their secret spot.

1660
01:20:55.522 --> 01:20:59.067
But she never showed
up to find it.

1661
01:20:59.067 --> 01:21:01.486
Heartbroken. he
tossed his journal.

1662
01:21:01.486 --> 01:21:06.324
the music box. and the painting
in the snow that night.

1663
01:21:06.324 --> 01:21:10.328
How these items found their way
across the world decades later.

1664
01:21:10.328 --> 01:21:11.913
I guess we'll never know.

1665
01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:18.712
Francois' story may not have
played out like a fairy tale.

1666
01:21:18.712 --> 01:21:21.673
But he did get his
happy ending after all.

1667
01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:27.971
He met Celine. a sculptor
visiting Le Marché from Lyon.

1668
01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:32.267
Their shared passion for the
art blossomed into a deep love.

1669
01:21:32.267 --> 01:21:36.229
And after a few years
together. they married.

1670
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:38.815
Now. with generation
of their families

1671
01:21:38.815 --> 01:21:41.901
still living in Petit
Marchand. I guess Le Marché

1672
01:21:41.901 --> 01:21:44.195
worked for him after all.

1673
01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:50.535
But that's the thing
about love. it's

1674
01:21:50.535 --> 01:21:52.037
not just a fairy
tale or something

1675
01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:54.414
you build up in your head.

1676
01:21:54.414 --> 01:22:00.086
It can be. but it's the magic
of reality that makes it work.

1677
01:22:04.215 --> 01:22:08.428
Sorry you didn't get
your perfect ending.

1678
01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:10.388
It's better.

1679
01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:11.931
It's real.

1680
01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:38.249
As for the legend of
Le Marché de Noel.

1681
01:22:38.249 --> 01:22:41.795
the jury is still
out on that one.

1682
01:22:41.795 --> 01:22:45.131
Maybe it's just a Christmas
wish. born under the twinkling

1683
01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:46.549
lights and the fallen snow.

1684
01:22:49.803 --> 01:22:52.889
Or maybe it's the magic of
being surrounded by people you

1685
01:22:52.889 --> 01:22:56.559
care about during the holidays.

1686
01:22:56.559 --> 01:22:59.896
Either way. I experienced
firsthand what the magic

1687
01:22:59.896 --> 01:23:02.357
of the Christmas market brings.

1688
01:23:02.357 --> 01:23:07.278
And though life may not turn out
exactly how you expect it to.

1689
01:23:07.278 --> 01:23:12.450
that doesn't mean it can't
be unexpectedly perfect.
