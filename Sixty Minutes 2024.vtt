DEAR LEONIE

6
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:08.916
Octa!

7
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.958
Yes. exactly.
But that's what I'm saying.

8
00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:28.916
Yes.

9
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.666
Yes. exactly.

10
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.208
Can we continue?
Or what aren't you paying me for?

11
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:39.708
Come on now. Go. jab!

12
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:41.666
One. two. three.

13
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:45.291
-Sprawl!
-Yes.

14
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.916
My guy's been warming up. Where are you?

15
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.833
Good form today.
You might actually win this.

16
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:21.250
Hey. what do you think you're doing?
Whoa. man.

17
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.416
You're supposed to warm up.
not burn up your energy.

18
00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.125
Oh. very funny.

19
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.583
Fucker. Get hurt
and we might as well close up shop.

20
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:34.291
-How much longer do I warm up?
-No idea. Don't ask me. Ask Benko.

21
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.625
-We've been waiting for an hour.
-I know.

22
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:40.291
The ref says we're about to start.
Benko is here.

23
00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.916
So stay warmed up. okay?
Cosi. don't go overboard with him.

24
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.291
Will I get my money then?

25
00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.000
If they keep delaying. we'll cancel.

26
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.958
What? No. we're not.

27
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:50.291
I have to see Leonie.

28
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.416
Octa. we need this fight. okay?

29
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.625
I'll wait in the car. Hurry up!

30
00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.083
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING!

31
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.500
-Hello.
-Hello. my lioness.

32
00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:37.458
When are you coming?

33
00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:42.125
Dad has to finish up at work.
I'll head over right after. okay?

34
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:46.083
-The others are about to leave.
-What? But the best is still to come.

35
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.875
The best cake in the world?

36
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.166
-Leonie?
-Yes.

37
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.791
I didn't eat to leave room for the cake.

38
00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:54.833
-Leonie!
-Wait until you see the other surprise.

39
00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.375
You're not coming. right?

40
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.750
Of course I'm coming.

41
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:06.291
For sure. I promise.
There's just a small delay here.

42
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.750
Octa. listen to me.

43
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.541
-Cosi.
-No. you're going to listen to me.

44
00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.416
Leonie. I'm coming. I promise.

45
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.333
See you soon. What's up?

46
00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:23.916
-Paul promised me a raise five months ago.
-Yeah.

47
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.583
Yeah. I didn't even get the money
from the last fight.

48
00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:28.416
I have no clue about the finances.

49
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.666
-Please talk to Paul about it.
-Look.

50
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.250
ONION

51
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.583
What's that?

52
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:38.125
-What do you mean? It's a cat.
-Why does it say "Onion"?

53
00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.583
-That's her name.
-Octa.

54
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.250
It's a gift for Leonie.

55
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.458
That raise is overdue.

56
00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.500
I'll talk to Paul. okay?

57
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:48.416
Seriously.

58
00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:51.208
After the fight.

59
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.541
-Actually do it.
-Yes.

60
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:56.791
Who came up with that dumb name. "Onion"?
That's not a cat's name?

61
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.083
The animal shelter.

62
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:03.250
Getting better?

63
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.541
'Cause you need that nonsense
in a fight. right?

64
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.875
-Yeah. yeah.
-Hey. You have three more days to prepare.

65
00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.791
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

66
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.125
Yes. Okay. we're leaving now.

67
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:15.708
All right. See you soon.

68
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.416
Okay. ref says 15 minutes.

69
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.083
Seriously. nearly an hour.

70
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.833
Yeah. because that jerk doesn't get
that you can be stuck in traffic.

71
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:30.541
SIXTY MINUTES

72
00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:32.958
Fucking Benko. man.

73
00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:37.583
DEAR LEONIE.

74
00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.708
"Dear Leonie."

75
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.583
"Dear Leonie"! A bit formal. isn't it?

76
00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.166
What's formal about that?

77
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.708
It's just formal. It's like "Dear…"

78
00:05:55.791 --> 00:06:00.083
You'd say. "Dear landlord…
Dear landlord. sorry I can't pay my rent."

79
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:03.000
-That's how you start a card.
-But not to your daughter.

80
00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:05.708
What-- Hey! What are you doing. man?

81
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:08.541
Why can't I get it right?

82
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.833
Because the fight's on her birthday.
That's not your fault.

83
00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.458
Yeah. it's never my fault.

84
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.875
-Okay. Here we go again?
-Hey. Paul…

85
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.166
No. it's all good.
No problem. Happy to do it.

86
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.583
Attention. here we go.

87
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:26.583
Hey. no one who has a child at 19
has to somehow get along with his ex.

88
00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:29.625
whom he never should have been with
because she's not a good fit.

89
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.750
but he wouldn't listen to his best friend…

90
00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:32.875
Leave it. Paul.

91
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.083
…and who wants a sports career.
can get it all right. okay?

92
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:39.208
I can't take too many hits.
or I can forget about the birthday.

93
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:42.791
-Hello? You're not gonna get hit. okay?
-No. I get it.

94
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.000
I suspected all along
that he's scared of fucking Benko.

95
00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:47.541
-Like all the other losers.
-Fuck you.

96
00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:49.458
-Can't you handle him?
-Of course I can!

97
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:50.375
Convincing.

98
00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:51.916
Going to your daughter's
with a black eye?

99
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.083
I'll destroy that fucker!

100
00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.541
-You'll destroy him?
-I will!

101
00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:57.833
-You won't get a fucking scratch.
-Whoa. hey! Don't do that.

102
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.125
-Okay. guys. let's go!
-Can you pick up the cat for me?

103
00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:02.916
Can I do what?

104
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.333
And the cake. No. I can do that myself.

105
00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:08.541
Cat. Animal shelter in Neukölln.
A present for Leonie.

106
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:11.458
Onion?

107
00:07:12.416 --> 00:07:13.291
That's not a cat name.

108
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.750
-Fuck you.
-Octa. we were just having a moment.

109
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.000
-Yeah. right.
-You ruined the moment.

110
00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.916
-Ask again if I want a black eye.
-Too late. You ruined the moment.

111
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.041
He ruined the moment.
Totally fucking ruined it. It's too…

112
00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.875
Ask me again if I want a black eye.

113
00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.916
-Do you want a black eye?
-I'll destroy him!

114
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.083
You'll destroy that fucker!

115
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:34.125
Whoa. dude! How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

116
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.041
-I sent you the address.
-Yeah. I'll do it.

117
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.291
Hey. Come here.

118
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.333
Come here. Come here for a picture.

119
00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.875
We need to say hello quickly.

120
00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:21.416
Hey. there he is!
Octavio fucking Bergmann.

121
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.541
I'm so excited to finally meet you.

122
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:27.166
-Octa. Cosi. Chino Winkler. his brother.
-Pleasure.

123
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.208
I can hardly wait.

124
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:31.291
Afterward. we'll all go
and have a nice drink together.

125
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.416
Yeah. we'll see.

126
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.750
No. not "we'll see." We will have a drink.

127
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:38.041
I bet on him. right?
If I bet on him. we celebrate.

128
00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:39.458
Let him fight first.

129
00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:42.666
-Bad mood?
-No. the mood is great.

130
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.208
Well. tell his face that.

131
00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.125
Go get warmed up.

132
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.375
You got this. big guy.

133
00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.625
Show that jerk that we fuck in Berlin.
We don't jerk off.

134
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:09.333
What's up with you?

135
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.333
Why would anything be up?

136
00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:16.291
-Why are you standing so close to me?
-Wow! Adrenaline! I love it. Adrenaline.

137
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.291
-Let him pass through.
-What's up with you?

138
00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:21.250
Destroy him. Octavio!

139
00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.208
-Just calm down.
-I am calm. He got too close.

140
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:27.625
-That makes me nervous. Hands off!
-Hey! Trash that fucker!

141
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:31.166
-Why did you bring these idiots backstage?
-Sorry. the guy's an old friend.

142
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.000
What's with these idiots. dude?

143
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:38.750
Ready to go?

144
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:41.666
Hurry up.

145
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.125
And you warm up a bit more. okay?

146
00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.333
Okay. how is your pulse?

147
00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:49.250
Cool. you're dead.
Give me your watch. I need to sync it.

148
00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.583
We still have a few minutes.
Let's go see the ref.

149
00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:02.666
Okay.

150
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:04.750
-See you. okay?
-See you.

151
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:20.416
Hey. Mina. I'm having the bandages put on.

152
00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:22.250
The fight isn't over?

153
00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.125
They delayed it three times.
Another fight was moved up.

154
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.583
Then why did you tell Leonie you'll come?

155
00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:28.500
I'm coming.

156
00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:32.500
You schedule a fight on her birthday
and then tell her you'll come?

157
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:35.208
Don't you understand
that she'll be waiting all day for you?

158
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:36.166
I'll be there soon.

159
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.833
Leonie has hardly eaten anything
because you promised her a damn cake.

160
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.458
If you don't want to see her. just say so.

161
00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:47.208
Why else do you always show up late
or not at all?

162
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.166
The fight is only three rounds. okay?

163
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.541
You'll never make it by six o'clock.

164
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.166
Then I'll be there at seven.

165
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.375
For three months.
we've agreed you'd be here at five.

166
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:58.000
The kids leave at six.
and then your parents come over.

167
00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.291
You know what?

168
00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:01.666
I'm done with this.

169
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:06.625
I…

170
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.583
How's it going? Ready to go?

171
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.416
I need to make it today.

172
00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.583
Okay. Octa.
Listen to me for a second. yeah?

173
00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.916
We need this fight.

174
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.375
We need the money.

175
00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:50.958
Afterward. I'll personally
drive you to Leonie.

176
00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:56.083
I'll race through the city at 120 mph.
I'll drive you to the moon and beyond.

177
00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.458
But now you need to function. please.

178
00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:02.541
She hasn't eaten all day
because she's waiting for my cake.

179
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.916
You know whose fault that is. right?

180
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.625
You know exactly who we have to thank
for all this fucking bullshit.

181
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:13.666
That ugly little fucker out there.

182
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.333
And that's why you'll go out there
and beat up fucking Benko so badly

183
00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:20.250
that he'll never be late again.

184
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.250
Okay. guys. Here we go.

185
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.125
Yeah. man.

186
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.250
Remember your strategy.
Stay on the defense.

187
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.708
Let him burn out.
Once he's tired. force him down.

188
00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:34.166
Three points.

189
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.208
Stay defensive. let him burn himself out.
and ground combat.

190
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.500
Force him to the floor.

191
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:56.666
All right. Berlin.

192
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.541
Mina calling.

193
00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:04.708
Mina?

194
00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:06.125
It's me.

195
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:08.625
-What? David. what do you want?
-It's over.

196
00:13:09.208 --> 00:13:12.958
-I can't right now. I've got a fight.
-Mina is filing for sole custody.

197
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:19.083
I'm representing her as her lawyer.
You'll have the documents tomorrow.

198
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:22.541
You know we have
enough legally relevant reasons by now.

199
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:25.333
-You're talking fucking nonsense.
-Leonie is crying--

200
00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:28.166
-Shut up! She's my daughter!
-Your daughter?

201
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.625
How so? Who's been taking care of her
for seven fucking years?

202
00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.500
Either you're here by six

203
00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:35.541
or I'll make sure
you never hurt my daughter again.

204
00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:37.208
You have one hour.

205
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.500
Hey. what's going on?

206
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.041
-Hey. what's going on now? What's up. man?
-No idea.

207
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.000
What are you doing. man?

208
00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:03.125
Get your ass into that cage right now.
Octa. man!

209
00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:06.291
What? Listen to me.
I understand your situation. okay?

210
00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:08.500
But we'll find a solution.

211
00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:10.541
Hey. now listen to me! We'll find--

212
00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.208
Sorry.

213
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:21.416
Mina wants to take Leonie away from me.

214
00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958
Shit.

215
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.291
Octa Bergmann. my man.
How are you doing. tiger?

216
00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.666
-All good.
-How's Paul? How's your gym?

217
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.833
-I know you'll do great. "Sting like a--"
-Sorry. Rico. Not now.

218
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:40.166
What? I placed a big bet on you. Octa.

219
00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:47.416
Don't always be such a chickenshit.
Show some initiative.

220
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.375
I am.

221
00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:50.625
You're not.
You're standing around like an idiot.

222
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:56.375
-Hey. Bergmann! Did you get lost? Hey?
-Where are you going?

223
00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:58.541
-Bergmann!
-What are you doing?

224
00:14:58.625 --> 00:14:59.666
Bergmann. come back!

225
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.750
People. move it! Go!

226
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.708
-Ladies. please?
-He's getting away!

227
00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:06.416
Three of you
go down to the car in the garage now!

228
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.625
Bring him back! Go. no questions!

229
00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.708
The guy has to fight.
or we're all screwed!

230
00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:25.041
Voice message from Leonie.

231
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:29.041
-Dad. you have to come. Mom is angry.
-Leonie. put that phone away.

232
00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:33.541
-Hey!
-Watch it!

233
00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:40.541
Easy. man.

234
00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:50.500
Hey! Hello? Hey. buddy!

235
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.208
-Hello?
-Quick. please. I'm in a hurry.

236
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.083
Asshole! Open up!

237
00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:56.125
Wiedeking?

238
00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.041
Yes. Quick. please.

239
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.500
Well. you don't look like a Wiedeking.

240
00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:01.958
But that's my name.

241
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:04.708
-He. on the other hand. does.
-There! The car!

242
00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:06.500
Dude. just drive.

243
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:09.041
Hey. fatso! Open the door.

244
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:10.291
Okay. Mr. Wiedeking.

245
00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.291
-Buckle up. Here we go.
-Hey!

246
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:15.083
What do you want. assholes?

247
00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:21.708
-All right. I'm Ronny. Where to?
-Max-Beer-Straße. Quickly. please.

248
00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.875
I got the "quickly" part already.

249
00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.291
but that's difficult during rush hour.

250
00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.208
-Octa. man.
-What bullshit is that?

251
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:52.833
-Yeah. it is.
-Nothing I can do. It's rush hour.

252
00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:55.958
But you can imagine the commotion here.
You just took off.

253
00:16:56.041 --> 00:16:57.791
I told you I wouldn't make it otherwise.

254
00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:01.083
No need to be so aggressive. okay?
I can't fly over it.

255
00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:02.583
Ronny. I'm on the phone.

256
00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:04.041
Oh. I see. Sorry.

257
00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.041
Who's Ronny?

258
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:08.833
Who's your old acquaintance?
What kind of drugs is he on?

259
00:17:08.916 --> 00:17:11.916
-He was pretty aggressive when I left.
-Okay. listen.

260
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:16.083
Since the others were late. I can buy
some time before you get disqualified.

261
00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.791
But to do that.
you have to please come back now--

262
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:24.083
-What happened?
-Prenzlauer Berg is what happened.

263
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:26.708
It was supposed
to be my alternative route.

264
00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:31.000
-Okay. Ronny. Turn around.
-First I need to look up which way to go.

265
00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:34.666
But the meter
is still running for Wiedeking.

266
00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:37.083
We'll let that jerk foot the bill.

267
00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.416
-Hey!
-Careful!

268
00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:47.625
-Ouch!
-Are you crazy or what?

269
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:48.916
What an idiot!

270
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.708
Hey. stop for a second!

271
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.250
Hey. be careful. Jeez!

272
00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:03.666
What's he doing?

273
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.416
What are you doing?

274
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.833
Wanna tell me
what the fuck your problem is?

275
00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:21.958
There's no problem.
Just get in and come with us.

276
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.250
Don't injure him.

277
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.083
Careful! He still has to fight!

278
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.416
What's up with you?

279
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.416
Come on! Get up and fight!

280
00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.541
Get him!

281
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.375
What are you doing over there?
Come on. get in!

282
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:15.916
Get up! You fight like cunts!

283
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.625
Move your lazy asses! Go on. fight!

284
00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.708
Come on. get up! Go and help him!

285
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.333
Grab him! Come on. now!

286
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.125
Good.

287
00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:32.458
Come on!

288
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:34.375
Nice!

289
00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:37.208
Put him to sleep. Yeah. that's it.

290
00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:40.375
That's right.

291
00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:43.625
And now into the car. please.
He has a fight to fight.

292
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:48.333
Careful with the rear seats! No scratches.

293
00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:50.375
You two are coming with me. Let's go!

294
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.875
Okay. Go through there.
and then turn right.

295
00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:55.791
Go.

296
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.083
Finally. Where's the car?

297
00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:06.041
Here.

298
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.208
You have to change something.

299
00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:33.708
Open up!

300
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.916
Yeah.

301
00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:15.083
Where are you right now?

302
00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:23.791
One second.

303
00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:26.375
Call from Mom.

304
00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:31.708
Not a good time right now.
Can I call you back?

305
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.250
Why can't I see Leonie today?

306
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:36.375
I'm arguing with Mina. I'm sorting it out.

307
00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:40.291
Mina just canceled on me by text.
That doesn't sound like an argument.

308
00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:42.583
The boys from Gregor's. Now!

309
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:44.583
Take care of it!

310
00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:46.375
Tell me what's going on.

311
00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:49.125
Don't worry so much.

312
00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:52.458
I want to see my granddaughter
on her birthday. okay?

313
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:55.541
-I'll call back later.
-Octavio. don't--

314
00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:57.416
Call Paul.

315
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.458
Calling Paul.

316
00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:00.416
Octa.

317
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.708
Paul. Who is Chino?

318
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.000
Listen. I've done a bit of research. okay?

319
00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:12.166
Chino. his brother.
all those other assholes.

320
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.500
they have a betting thing going.
but also more serious stuff.

321
00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:17.958
The fight was rigged?

322
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:19.750
The fight was rigged.

323
00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:23.750
Chino bet 75.000 on you.

324
00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:26.458
You're supposed to knock out Benko
in round three.

325
00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:30.625
Until you're disqualified. we can still
turn it around. I'll sort it out for us.

326
00:22:30.708 --> 00:22:33.416
But we mustn't mess with them.

327
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:35.166
No matter what. okay?

328
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.416
I knocked them the fuck out.

329
00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:40.000
-Who did you knock out?
-All of them.

330
00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:41.875
-All of them?
-All of them!

331
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.708
-I must be at Leonie's in 50 minutes.
-Fuck!

332
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:50.250
-Can't you just explain to Mina that…
-And tell her what?

333
00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:53.333
That I snapped and beat up some guys?
That doesn't help me with custody.

334
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:56.416
Paul. get the fuck out of there.
Those people are dangerous.

335
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.041
Hey! Over here!

336
00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:00.291
Okay. Octa. Wait--

337
00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:02.416
Come on! Step on it!

338
00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:07.208
Go get him!

339
00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:22.333
Voice message to Cosima.

340
00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:25.083
Are you at the gym? I need your help.

341
00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:27.166
Sending voice message.

342
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.666
-I have no idea…
-Hey. Go inside.

343
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.750
-Octa. hey.
-Come.

344
00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:50.833
What's going on?

345
00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:53.000
I'm being chased.

346
00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:54.833
Bruno! Annika.

347
00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:23.458
-The cops will be here in a minute.
-Yeah? Fuck you.

348
00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:18.708
Hey. What the fuck is going on here?

349
00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:22.250
I have to get to Leonie.
Stop the fuckers for me.

350
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.333
20%.

351
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.083
I don't know about the finances. Cosi.

352
00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.291
20%. or I'm not doing anything.

353
00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:34.750
My landlord's been trying to kick me out
for six months. I need the money.

354
00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.416
Mina wants to strip custody from me.

355
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.875
Shit.

356
00:25:58.375 --> 00:25:59.833
You'll pick up the cake for me.

357
00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:02.250
Max Beer Street. Pastry Guys.

358
00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:04.458
And bring it to Leonie. I'll talk to Paul.

359
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.791
One. two. three.

360
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.958
Fuck you!

361
00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:36.958
Move it. you rat!

362
00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:03.708
You little cunt!

363
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.791
Come on! Go get that son of a bitch!

364
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.291
After him!

365
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.291
Go! Get in the car!

What's this?

372
00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:51.333
Be careful.

373
00:27:52.333 --> 00:27:53.375
What do they want?

374
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.125
Hey. now!

375
00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:01.000
Are you crazy? What's this?

376
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500
-Don't you have eyes or what?
-Hey!

377
00:28:03.583 --> 00:28:05.500
Are you playing the fool? Want trouble?

378
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.625
-What kind of show is this?
-Forget it. clowns.

379
00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:09.208
-What did you say?
-Clown.

380
00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:13.333
Okay. I'm done with being insulted.
Enough is enough.

381
00:28:13.416 --> 00:28:17.000
-Stop there. Stop right there.
-You can come with us right away. okay?

382
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:18.833
-What?
-So I am your clown?

383
00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:20.000
-He was the one who--
-Wait.

384
00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:21.875
You wanted to mess with us.

385
00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:24.416
I had a question.
You didn't open the window.

386
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.708
Go ahead and clear the road.
Nothing happened. after all.

387
00:28:27.791 --> 00:28:30.000
-Get in the car now.
-Why me? He was…

388
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.916
Hey. do you think we're stupid?

389
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.666
You can explain at the station what you
and your friends were planning to do here.

390
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.291
-I don't have time right now.
-Take him.

391
00:28:39.833 --> 00:28:41.208
Get in. Come on. now.

392
00:28:41.291 --> 00:28:42.791
With or without handcuffs.

393
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.708
Your choice.

394
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:47.375
Let's go.

395
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.375
How about buckling up. buddy?

396
00:29:13.125 --> 00:29:16.791
Squad car C12 on the way to the station.
Suspicious person on board.

397
00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:21.291
Insulting an official. maybe more.
We'll run all the tests on him.

398
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.791
Which station are we going to?

399
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.250
Are you a wise guy?

400
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.625
The one at Alex?

401
00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:31.333
Why? Is that your favorite?

402
00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:33.791
Yes or no?

403
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.750
-This isn't the way to Alex.
-Shut up back there!

404
00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:42.958
What did I do?

405
00:29:43.041 --> 00:29:45.208
Ever heard of road safety?

406
00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:47.916
-I'm the one who got hit.
-Section 315. criminal code.

407
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Exactly.

408
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:52.916
Can you please tell me
which station we're going to?

409
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.791
Which one would you like to go to?

410
00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:58.750

Should we stop at your grandma's?

417
00:30:14.458 --> 00:30:15.416
Shut your mouth.

418
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.083
Here we go again. then?

419
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:19.916

You're coming with me now.
Enough with the nonsense!

424

I've been running around the fucking city!
You have no idea who you're messing with.

425
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.291
I'm doing you a favor. Trust me.

426
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:20.416
This is bigger than you think.
so don't fuck around now. okay?

427
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.041
Get in!

00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.708
Bruno's not doing well at all.

435
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:32.291
But I've talked to Chino.

436
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:35.291
-Yeah. and?
-I won't quote his exact words.

437
00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:39.750
-He wants you in the cage. Period.
-He loses no money if there is no fight.

438
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:42.166
He does.
With an illegal bet. the money's gone.

439
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.875
But he swore he wouldn't hurt you
if you came back.

440
00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:46.791
Yeah.

441
00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:48.416

Can you at least tell me
who those guys are?

459
00:34:17.458 --> 00:34:18.416
The fight was rigged.

460
00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:20.958
Holy shit.

461
00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:35.166

So is Benko's.
The fucker was part of it too.

480
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:38.500
Paul called you?

481
00:37:39.083 --> 00:37:42.958
No. I called Paul. I wanted to know
why you ran away from the fight.

482
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.916
What's going on with Mina this time?

483
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.250
Long story.

484
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.416
I've got time.

485
00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:53.750
Well. I don't. I have to get to Leonie.

486
00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:58.166
-Can you take me to the subway?
-Sure. Our club's right next to it.

487
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:13.000
You can go through there.

488
00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.500
Thanks. Rico. I owe you one.

489
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:28.250
-I'm sorry. kiddo.
-All good. It's not your fault.

490
00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:38.250
I really am sorry.

491
00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:54.666
Octavio. just do exactly as she says.

492
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.416
Don't talk back.

493
00:38:57.541 --> 00:38:58.708
As a favor to me. okay?

494
00:39:58.333 --> 00:39:59.625
Who do you work for?

495
00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:05.916
No one. I'm self-employed.
I own a martial arts studio.

496
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
What do you want?

497
00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:11.166
Octa. just tell them about Chino. man.

498
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:17.166

499
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.041
No idea what this is about.

500
00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:21.750
-I've known him all my life.
-Leave!

501
00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:26.458
Rico. what's going on?

502
00:40:28.375 --> 00:40:29.541
What's going on here?

503
00:40:39.666 --> 00:40:42.791
-Who are you working for?
-Nobody. I'm working for nobody.

504
00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:53.291
I have no idea what this is about. man!

505
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:09.333
Why didn't you go ahead with the fight?

506
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.291
My ex wants to take my daughter away.
I can't let that happen.

507
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:26.375
What's your daughter's name?

508
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:30.958
Does she have a name?

509
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.041
Leonie.

510
00:41:36.791 --> 00:41:37.791
Last name?

511
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.083
Last name!

512
00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.291
Last name.

513
00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:03.250
Last name!

514
00:42:41.708 --> 00:42:45.166
Tell Danica I'm about to get him.
I almost had him. and then…

515
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.875
-I'll get him. Tell her that.
-We have the athlete here.

516
00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:52.291
Come here and tell us how you're
paying back the 500.000 you gambled away.

517
00:42:53.625 --> 00:42:54.708
Is Danica there too?

Voice message for Paul.

523
00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:00.875
They want to ice Chino and me.

524
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.541
Does anyone have a knife or scissors?

525
00:45:09.375 --> 00:45:10.583
Is that you?

526
00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:17.333
Do you have scissors?

527
00:45:19.666 --> 00:45:21.625
If you turn around. I can open them.

528
00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.041
Thanks.

529
00:45:43.916 --> 00:45:45.250
What the hell is that?

530
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:08.250
Thanks.

531
00:46:21.916 --> 00:46:24.458
HUMMER RAMS POLICE!

Call from Leonie.

533
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:39.166
Hey. my lioness.
Have you eaten anything yet?

534
00:46:40.166 --> 00:46:41.291
You're not coming.

535
00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:43.791
-Sure I'm coming.
-You're lying!

536
00:46:45.416 --> 00:46:47.958
Mom said you're not coming.

537
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:51.958
I'm going to eat Mom's cake now.

538
00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:55.583
I will definitely be there.
Look. I'm already on the subway.

539
00:46:56.708 --> 00:46:58.666
I'll just pick up your gift on the way.

540
00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:04.583
-Where's the exit?
-I've been wondering for days.

541
00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:06.791
-Exit?
-Upstairs. through the bar.

542
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.500
-Hey.
-Hey. what's going on with you?

543
00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:55.000
Come on!

544
00:54:06.166 --> 00:54:08.291
Disconnected from "Paul Cell."

545
00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:36.333
Shit. man. Okay. I'll get a doctor.

546
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:43.500
I'll kill you.

547
00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:52.291
You tracked me.

548
00:54:58.333 --> 00:54:59.708
And told them where I was.

549
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:08.166
Okay. listen.

550
00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:12.625
Look. when you took off earlier.

551
00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:16.416
I thought it would be best
if you just came back.

552
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:19.291
And that's why I helped them. yes.

553
00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:23.958
But when they started messing with you.
I didn't want to help them anymore.

554
00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:27.875
But then. unfortunately. it was too late.
They almost killed me.

555
00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:30.875
Paul.

556
00:55:35.125 --> 00:55:35.958
Run.

557
00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:40.041
Octa. Please. man.

558
00:55:45.083 --> 00:55:48.208
We could work with them. With Chino.

559
00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:53.625
Look. I'm starting
to figure this shit out. okay?

560
00:55:53.708 --> 00:55:58.416
Chino didn't just bet his money on you
but also half a million for other people.

561
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.708
Now only you
can straighten this fucking mess out.

562
00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:03.291
I'll get up in ten seconds.

563
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:06.750
Dude. don't you get it?
Chino needs you. man.

564
00:56:07.416 --> 00:56:08.583
He needs us.

565
00:56:08.666 --> 00:56:11.208
He bet half a million on you
for some assholes.

566
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:15.166
-The fucking gambling mafia.
-Only you can straighten it out.

567
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.583
Don't you get that?

568
00:56:16.666 --> 00:56:18.250
They just tried to kill me.

569
00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:22.708
Okay. listen. If we work with Chino…

570
00:56:22.791 --> 00:56:26.416
-Shut your mouth.
-Some rigged fights. we rack up the dough.

571
00:56:31.791 --> 00:56:33.666
Run. Fuck off.

572
00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:43.333
Voice message from Paul.

573
00:57:43.416 --> 00:57:47.125
You have to forgive me. man.
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

574
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:41.416
What happened?

575
00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:43.666
-A little accident.
-What kind?

576
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:46.375
-What are you looking for?
-Where's the disinfectant?

577
00:58:56.958 --> 00:58:58.375
You need a doctor.

578
00:58:58.458 --> 00:59:00.000
Do you have painkillers?

579
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.500
-I'll call an ambulance.
-No.

580
00:59:06.791 --> 00:59:07.958
What happened?

581
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.416
It's all good.

582
00:59:23.458 --> 00:59:24.875
A scooter driver hit me.

583
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:27.375
All good.

584
00:59:35.916 --> 00:59:37.041
Marco.

585
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:48.791
Step aside. please.

586
00:59:54.625 --> 00:59:56.625
Octavio. talk to us.

587
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:59.125
I'll rest for a minute.

588
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Why no doctor?

589
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.833
I need to see Leonie.

590
01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.541
Like this?

591
01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:11.791
Yeah. I don't know. I…

592
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.916
Mina won't let you see Leonie like this.

593
01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:18.875
Paul calling.

594
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:21.458
Take call?

595
01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:27.708
Be quiet for a sec. I have to take a call.

596
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I fucked up.

597
01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:40.916
We have money problems.

598
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.125
Major ones.

599
01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.333
I didn't tell you because I…

600
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.958
I wanted to fix it myself somehow.

601
01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.791
Octa.

602
01:00:58.333 --> 01:00:59.791
It was my idea to rig the fight.

603
01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.416
I'm so sorry. man. I…

604
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:09.625
I thought it would be an easy way
to get some money.

605
01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:11.750
And…

606
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:16.833
neither you nor Cosi.
no one would have ever known. That's why…

607
01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:21.083
Yeah. well. Anyway. I…

608
01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:25.916
I just wanted you to know
so you'll trust me again.

609
01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:34.166
You can trust me. man.

610
01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:42.416
I just wanted to make money quickly.
And then Chino dragged me into this. okay?

611
01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:47.875
I'm sorry.
If I could turn back the clock. I'd do it.

612
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.291
It's okay.

613
01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:57.041
Yeah?

614
01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.041
Yeah.

615
01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:03.083
Okay. cool.

616
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.541
Thanks. man.

617
01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.041
Can I help you?

618
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.125
Where are you?

619
01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:17.750
On your way to Leonie?
Or are you picking up the cat?

620
01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:25.625
Oh. by the way.

621
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:29.041
you asked me for a cat name. right?

622
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.916
An ex of mine had a cat.
You know what it was called?

623
01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:35.666
Onion.

624
01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah. I know. Sounds stupid

625
01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.958
but also funny somehow. right?

626
01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.291
I won't make it to Leonie today.

627
01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.083
Sorry. man.

628
01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:53.541
And where are you right now?

629
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.791
I'm at a buddy's house.
I'll get back to you later.

630
01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:58.791
What? Why?

631
01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:21.416
Have I always been such a mess?

632
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.041
With Leonie.

633
01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:28.750
That I…

634
01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:30.958
You're scared.

635
01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:33.500
What?

636
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.875
There's this tiny human in your life

637
01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:40.333
that you have to take care of.

638
01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:43.125
For whom you're responsible.
And what do you do?

639
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.083
You're unreliable. You fuck up.

640
01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:48.875
You let down those who need you.
whom you love.

641
01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.500
But it's not your fault. It's all unfair.

642
01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:53.541
-The whole damn universe is against you.
-Marco.

643
01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:56.083
I got this fight. that tournament.
work to do in the boxing gym.

644
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.458
He's trying.

645
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.250
He's not a mess. He's scared.

646
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:08.333
Of having nothing to offer.
Of being a shitty father.

647
01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:12.500
Of doing everything wrong.

648
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.500
So he runs away.

649
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.833
And abandons his child.

650
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:22.541
For way too long.

651
01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:29.916
Because he's trying to prevent her
from becoming like him.

652
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.583
If you want Leonie to be better off.

653
01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:41.208
then you have to do things differently
than how you experienced them.

654
01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:44.291
Then you don't run away.

655
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.833
Then you'll get it together.

656
01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.208
And you'll finally be there for her.

657
01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.458
I'll be in touch again tomorrow.

658
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.375
Thanks.

659
01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:10.666
Do you want to take some food?

660
01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.416
We have a door!

661
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:32.458
Call Paul.

662
01:05:32.541 --> 01:05:33.416
Calling Paul.

663
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.541
-I'm going to the shelter after all.
-Really? Now?

664
01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:41.833
They're insisting on it.

665
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.083
Maybe I'll keep the cat myself.

666
01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:46.125
Okay. and when will you be there?

667
01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.041
-In a few minutes.
-Okay. I'll go there as well.

668
01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.041
Call Rico.

669
01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:58.125
Calling Rico.

670
01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.791
Octa. Please don't
take this personally. okay?

671
01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:07.916
-You know how these things go.
-I have an offer for your people.

672
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.916
I'm listening.

673
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.250
I know where Chino will be soon.

674
01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.375
Where?

675
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:16.583
How do I know
your people will leave me alone?

676
01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:19.375
-They only want Chino.
-They almost killed me.

677
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:23.291
-Well. you ran away from the fight!
-I didn't know that it was rigged.

678
01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:24.875
Really. huh?

679
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.791
Okay. I'll sort it out.
But please tell me where Chino is.

680
01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:30.791
In Neukölln.

681
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.750
-I'll send you the address soon.
-Why--

682
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.041
Message from Cosima.

683
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.166
"Octa. I just saw Paul
with that scumbag from the arena."

684
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.791
"Thought you should know."

685
01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:19.333
Open up!

686
01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:20.291
We're closed!

687
01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.666
It's ten to six.

688
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.583
Maybe on your watch.

689
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.458
-What?
-Maybe on your watch!

690
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.250
I'm picking up a cat.

691
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.000
Not today. We're closed.

692
01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.083
It'll take two minutes. okay? Come on.

693
01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:43.375
Sure. You know how long it takes a family
to pick up a cat?

694
01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:45.458
They look around. Then they look again.

695
01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:48.375
