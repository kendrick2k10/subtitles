Thank you very much.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.223
Thank you. Thank you.

16
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:58.767
Okay.

17
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.937
Very. very cool.
I need that more than you know.

18
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:08.276
Hey. everyone. We are here tonight
to induct some of the greatest stand-ups

19
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.363
of all time into a place of honor
we're calling The Hall.

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.741
Yes.

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.245
So welcome to the first ever
Stand-Up Comedy Hall of Fame

22
00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.956
Introduction Ceremony.
I am Pete Davidson.

23
00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.000
Yes.

24
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.505
The guy who took the special
out of comedy special.

25
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.801
So we're gonna kick off this event
honoring comics who passed away

26
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:36.179
and I'm pretty sure it's because they're
betting. like. I might not be alive

27
00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.889
by the time this airs.

28
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.479
Trust me. I think I'm a weird choice
to intro a Stand-Up Hall of Fame too.

29
00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.357
In the last few years.
I've been onstage less than

30
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.192
the babies inside Ali Wong.

31
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.867
Tonight. we are honoring true legends.

32
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.787
Like Joan Rivers. who sparked... yeah.

33
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.582
Yeah.

34
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:09.587
It sparked a very fierce debate at Netflix
about which face we were going to use

35
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.672
for her picture.

36
00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:13.716
Well...

37
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.219
we landed on that one.

38
00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.639
Robin Williams. who is the-- yeah.

39
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.225
The GOAT.

40
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:29.190
He's also the literal opposite of me
in energy. talent. and body hair.

41
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:31.818
George Carlin.

42
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.403
The soothing-- yes.

43
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.489
George Carlin.

44
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:41.244
The soothing voice of the conductor
on <i>Thomas the Tank Engine.</i>

45
00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.539
And the guy who taught you
the word cocksucker.

46
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.877
And of course. Richard Pryor.

47
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.044
Right?

48
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:59.596
Richard Pryor. he redefined comedy
despite tragically giving Chevy Chase

49
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.723
the confidence to say the N word.

50
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.018
It's a real thing. Google that.

51
00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.396
The class tonight is very special.

52
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.190
The Hall did their research in picking
the four nominees. okay?

53
00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.776
They didn't just select comedians
that were young and trendy.

54
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.737
in hopes of boosting viewership.

55
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.451
For some reason. they think I'll do that.

56
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.664
Our four inductees tonight were all
legitimately voted in

57
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:31.127
by a board of agents. club owners.
managers. and other influential members

58
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.629
of the comedy community.

59
00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.132
Which is a long-winded way of saying Jews.

60
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.556
It's going to be a really fun night.
seriously.

61
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.976
We've got Mix Master Mike
from The Beastie Boys deejaying.

62
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.231
Fucking sick.

63
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.066
Super tight.

64
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.153
And lots of great alive comedians
to talk about the dead ones.

65
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:01.241
Like we got Mulaney. Chappelle.
and Handler. yeah.

66
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.996
You could only see together these people
in a really nice theater.

67
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.915
or an even nicer rehab.

68
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.963
The Hall is going to be a part
of the National Comedy Center

69
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.506
in Jamestown. New York.

70
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.716
Yeah. that's a real place.

71
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.678
But tonight. thank God.
is not about me.

72
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.682
It's about these legends that are finally
getting the respect they deserve

73
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.102
on the same streaming platform
that airs <i>Is it Cake?</i>

74
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.237
So let's enjoy a healthy mix
of laughter and crying.

75
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.947
Like me when I masturbate.

76
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.660
And now. come on. I had to have a few
little hey... zingers in there.

77
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:53.710
Want to know something really funny?
I... I couldn't do...

78
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.837
this is the weirdest sentence
I think I've ever said.

79
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.300
I couldn't put makeup on for this
because I got a spray tan.

80
00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:03.720
Which I think is the weirdest thing
I've ever said.

81
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.307
Ever. And I asked my--
I'd never gotten a spray tan before.

82
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.017
I asked my boy. I was like...

83
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.395
"Do I do my dick and ass?"

84
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.566
Like. I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

85
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.695
Do I get one of those Borat fucking
Speedos? I had no idea.

86
00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.322
And my boy was like.

87
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.158
"No. leave it white.
More impressive that way."

88
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:34.250
And now. it's my honor to introduce
my friend. Jon Stewart. okay?

89
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.002
Jon Stewart...

90
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.465
was recently honored
with the Mark Twain award.

91
00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:45.011
And is such a consummate performer.
he's equally excited to be doing this.

92
00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:46.304
Jon Stewart. everyone!

93
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.515

94

101
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.662
Thanks to Pete Davidson.
You know. there are not a lot of comics

102
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:15.291
who can come right from a duck blind
to the show.

103
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.048
And still kill.

104
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:28.554
I'm here to induct someone
that I have great respect for.

105
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.183
I had the pleasure of knowing
for a little bit.

106
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:33.893
Mr. George Carlin.

107
00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:37.647
[applause]

108
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.815
Let us begin.

109
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.695
Shit.

110
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.620
Piss.

111
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.169
Fuck.

112
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.672
[crowd cheers]

113
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.049
Sorry. scroll up.

114
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:09.846
Cunt.

115
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.473
[small cheer from crowd]

116
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:19.147
You don't hear enough applause for that.

117
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.776
Cocksucker.

118
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.028
[crowd cheers]

119
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.573
I see where the crowd's at.

120
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:32.702
Motherfucker.

121
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.287
[crowd cheers loudly]

122
00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.081
You're going to love the last one.

123
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:39.709
Tits.

124
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.044
[crowd cheers]

125
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.883
Piss has got some work to do.

126
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.429
Cunt and tits are killing it.

127
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:57.602
1972. George Carlin uttered
the seven words

128
00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.646
you cannot say on television.

129
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.735
Shit. piss. cunt. fuck. cocksucker.
motherfucker. and tits.

130
00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:11.115
I was nine.

131
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.953
And I fell in love.

132
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.127
I didn't know any of it. what it meant.
but the tits bit...

133
00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.297
cheese tits.

134
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.011
It was then that George Carlin
established himself

135
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.598
as a counter-culture hero.

136
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.142
But it wasn't just about saying the words.
He had a point to it.

137
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:42.063
It was the absurdity
that these seven words

138
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:44.649
carried power when they were just words.

139
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.984
They weren't deeds. They weren't thoughts.

140
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.946
They weren't bad intentions.
They were just words.

141
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.865
George Carlin was arrested.
Lenny Bruce was arrested.

142
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.953
They were sued. They were taken to court.
They were brought in...

143
00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:01.415
on charges for saying words.

144
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.669
Ladies and gentlemen.
that was 50 years ago.

145
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:10.049
Today. those would be the titles
of the next seven Netflix shows.

146
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.893
That was his moment.

147
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:24.438
You know. we're a fortunate group.

148
00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:25.731
Comedians.

149
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:31.070
Even more rare is when a comedian
has a moment

150
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.947
in the culture

151
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:38.244
when the times somehow meet the talent.

152
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:42.915
And there's an alchemy
that creates greatness.

153
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.587
That was George Carlin in the 1970s.

154
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.590
He was everything!

155
00:09:54.969 --> 00:10:00.016
But even more rare. almost unheard of.

156
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:07.607
is a comedian who gives up
making a living on the road

157
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.778
to try and become a legend of the time.

158
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:16.782
And that's where George Carlin's courage
and bravery.

159
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.826
and not enough is said about that.

160
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:24.957
This cat started in the 1960s
wearing the sharkskin suit.

161
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.127
And the thin tie.
and going on Merv Griffin.

162
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.757
And doing the impressions.
And he was making a living.

163
00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:36.969
His wife. Brenda.
His young daughter. Kelly.

164
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.057
He bought a house. They were making it.

165
00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.893
And he was empty.

166
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:49.482
He wasn't himself.
He wasn't actualized as an artist.

167
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.696
And so he fucking threw it all away.

168
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.910
The idea that you would give up
the dream of making a living

169
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:04.372
and supporting your family--
they put their house in escrow.

170
00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:08.834
Because he felt he wasn't being himself.
He grew a beard. he grew out his hair.

171
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.711
And he threw on some jeans.

172
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:14.382
And he started doing bits about
Muhammad Ali getting thrown

173
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.384
to the wolves

174
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.179
for not allowing himself to be drafted
into Vietnam.

175
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:24.266
And the bit was basically...
Muhammad Ali beats people up

176
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.602
for a living. And what he said was.

177
00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.522
"I'll beat people up.
but I don't wanna kill them."

178
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.566
And the government said...

179
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.736
"If you're not gonna kill them.

180
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.197
we're not gonna let you
beat them up."

181
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.326
He didn't give a shit.
He just went out there.

182
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.078
He was an artist.

183
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.831
[crowd cheers]

184
00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:55.756
I was fortunate enough in the '90s

185
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.633
to become friendly with George.

186
00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:01.303
I finally got a chance to go out and spend
some time with him out in Los Angeles.

187
00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.848
I was going to interview him
for a special.

188
00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:06.684
He was celebrating 40 years in comedy.

189
00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.062
We were doing it in Aspen. Colorado.

190
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.818
Because generally. the people that produce
comedy shows have the wisdom

191
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.904
to take a guy
whose had four heart attacks.

192
00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:23.409
and have him perform
where there's very little oxygen.

193
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:36.755
That's why I don't do the
"HBO Is A Joke Festival."

194
00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.843
I do the Netflix Is A Joke Special.

195
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.928
[applause]

196
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.138
Look at you people.

197
00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:47.808
Displaying brand loyalty.
That's very exciting.

198
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.768
[Jon laughs]

199
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:55.524
You know. in his later years.
everybody said Carlin got real dark.

200
00:12:56.275 --> 00:13:00.279
You know. he cheered for the demise
of the world. That he became nihilistic.

201
00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:03.157
But it wasn't that at all.
It was disappointment.

202
00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.452
I'd never been with somebody
who had such empathy

203
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.329
for the human condition.

204
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:13.250
And I think his material in later years
was just a reflection of the fact that

205
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:16.629
he was fucking truly heartbroken

206
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:21.509
about what we were doing to each other.
And what we were doing to ourselves.

207
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.636
But the interesting thing to me was.

208
00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.388
for a counterculture hero
like George Carlin.

209
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.099
he really was a blue collar worker.

210
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.228
He'd go to his office at 9:00 a.m..
and he'd sit and write.

211
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.856
I mean. I've never met a person

212
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.485
who smoked that much pot

213
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.405
and worked that hard.

214
00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:46.659
He would write his jokes...

215
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:52.540
and then. he would get out the weed.
or as he would say to me

216
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:56.043
when I was sitting in his office.
"It's punch-up time."

217
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.845
George Carlin died in 2008.

218
00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.893
2006 or 2007. Twitter was born.

219
00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:16.063
If you go on Twitter.
every now and again.

220
00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.149
George Carlin is trending.

221
00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:24.405
On a platform that he really didn't have
any idea what it was.

222
00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:30.995
But he'll just pop up randomly
when weird shit goes down in the world.

223
00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:35.457
Because as a culture. we miss his voice.

224
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.836
And that. for a comedian.

225
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.757
is the greatest honor you can give.

226
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.217
[applause]

227
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:49.722
We miss him.

228
00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.391
We miss his voice.

229
00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.852
We want to know what he would think.

230
00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:00.399
Comedy's ephemeral. man.
Almost nobody survives their moment.

231
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:03.819
He survived five decades

232
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:09.617
as a trenchant observer. an analyst.
an absurdist. and a comedian.

233
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.746
And a friend. and a father.
and a husband.

234
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.205
And a humanitarian.

235
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.124
He was incredible.

236
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.336
And I can't tell you how often
I miss him.

237
00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:24.131
And how much I think about him.
and how grateful I was for...

238
00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.468
even the little time that we had
to spend together.

239
00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:30.512
Ladies and gentlemen. George Carlin.

240
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.557
[applause]

241
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.892
[Carlin] George Carlin.

242
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.894
And George Carlin.

243
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.938
I used to be this guy.

244
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.190
Or maybe this guy used to be me.

245
00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.525
I don't know. We were each other
at one time.

246
00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:48.238
We have more ways to describe dirty words
than we actually have dirty words.

247
00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.617
That seems a little strange to me.

248
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:56.413
It seems to indicate that somebody
was awfully interested in these words.

249
00:15:56.497 --> 00:16:02.169
They kept referring to them.
They called them bad words. dirty.

250
00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:06.340
Filthy. Foul. Vile. Vulgar.

251
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:07.967
Coarse.

252
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.720
In poor taste. Unseemly.

253
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:17.101
Street talk. Gutter talk.
Locker room language. Barracks talk.

254
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:21.105
Bawdy. Naughty. Saucy. Raunchy.

255
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:25.818
Rude. Crude. Lewd. Lascivious.
Indecent. Profane. Obscene.

256
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:27.778
Blue. Off color.

257
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:29.780
Risqué.

258
00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.282
Suggestive.

259
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.368
Cursing. Cussing. Swearing.

260
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.954
All I could think of was
shit. piss. fuck. cunt. cocksucker.

261
00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:38.330
motherfucker. and tits!

262
00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:39.832
[crowd cheers]

263
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.751
"Take a shit" is another one.

264
00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.671
Take a shit?

265
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.049
You don't take a shit. you leave a shit.

266
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.469
That's the whole idea!

267
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.138
To leave it!

268
00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:03.355
Germs. Where did this sudden fear
of germs come from in this country?

269
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.648
Have you noticed this?

270
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:08.444
The media constantly running stories
about all the latest infections.

271
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:11.780
Salmonella. E. Coli. Hantavirus.
Bird Flu.

272
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.617
And Americans. they panic easily.
so now. everybody's running around

273
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.244
scrubbing this and spraying that.

274
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.997
And overcooking their food.
Repeatedly washing their hands

275
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.499
trying to avoid all contact with germs.

276
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:25.919
It's ridiculous. and it goes
to ridiculous lengths.

277
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:29.506
In prisons. before they give you
a lethal injection.

278
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.800
they swab your arm with alcohol.

279
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.095
Did you ever belch. and almost puke?

280
00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.686
I never fucked a ten.

281
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.521
Never fucked a ten!

282
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.900
But one night. I fucked five two's.

283
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.651
Yeah.

284
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.946
Here's something you never hear a man say.

285
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.699
"Stop sucking my dick
or I'll call the police."

286
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.789
They wonder why there's no blue food.

287
00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.754
Haven't we gone a little overboard
with these colored ribbons

288
00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:10.005
for different causes?

289
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.132
Every cause has its own
colored ribbon now.

290
00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.760
Red for AIDS. Blue for child abuse.
Pink for breast cancer.

291
00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:17.054
Green for the rainforest.
Purple for urban violence.

292
00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:20.349
I got a brown one. Know what it means?
Eat shit. motherfucker!

293
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.643
Eat shit. motherfucker!

294
00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:25.979
But in the bullshit department.
in the bullshit department.

295
00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:29.858
a businessman can't hold a candle
to a clergyman.

296
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:33.320
'Cause I got to tell you the truth. folks.
I got to tell you the truth.

297
00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:35.114
When it comes to bullshit.

298
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:41.286
big time. major league bullshit.
you have to stand in awe.

299
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:45.624
in awe of the all-time champion
of false promises

300
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:49.545
and exaggerated claims. religion.
No contest.

301
00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.672
No contest.

302
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:56.343
Religion. Religion easily has

303
00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:59.555
the greatest bullshit story ever told.

304
00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:04.226
Think about it.
Religion has actually convinced people

305
00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.687
that there's an invisible man

306
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.148
living in the sky.

307
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:13.026
Who watches everything you do.
every minute of every day.

308
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.699
And the invisible man has a special list
of ten things he does not want you to do.

309
00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:22.953
And if you do any of these ten things.
he has a special place

310
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:26.748
full of fire. and smoke. and burning.
and torture. and anguish.

311
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:30.294
where he will send you to live.
and suffer. and burn. and choke.

312
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:34.339
and scream. and cry forever and ever
till the end of time.

313
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:36.758
But he loves you.

314
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.725
He loves you.

315
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:51.356
He loves you. and he needs money!

316
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.027
He always needs money!

317
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.405
He's all powerful. all perfect.
all knowing. and all wise.

318
00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:01.366
somehow. just can't handle money.

319
00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:08.207
Religion takes in billions of dollars.
They pay no taxes.

320
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.500
And they always need a little more.

321
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.795
Now. you talk
about a good bullshit story.

322
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.048
Holy shit.

323
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:22.054
But I would like to bring you up to date
on the "Comedians Health Sweepstakes."

324
00:20:23.263 --> 00:20:27.726
As it stands right now.
I lead Richard Pryor in heart attacks

325
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:28.936
two to one.

326
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.355
I'm ahead. I am ahead.

327
00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.523
That's right. Now...

328
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:39.279
However. Richard still leads me
one to nothing on burning yourself up.

329
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.870
Well. the way it happened was.
first Richard had a heart attack.

330
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.622
Then. I had a heart attack.

331
00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.540
Then. Richard burned himself up.

332
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:54.127
Then. I said. fuck that.
I'm going to have another heart attack.

333
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:58.131
Why? Why?

334
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:04.972
Why? Why? Why is it that most of the
people who are against abortion

335
00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:08.475
are people you wouldn't want to fuck
in the first place?

336
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:14.690
I'm a modern man.
A man for the millennium.

337
00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.108
Digital and smoke-free.

338
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:19.236
A diversified. multicultural.
postmodern deconstructionist

339
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.197
politically. anatomically.
and ecologically incorrect.

340
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:25.200
I got a personal trainer.
a personal shopper. a personal assistant.

341
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.785
and a personal agenda.

342
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:29.579
You can't shut me up.
You can't dumb me down.

343
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:31.498
Because I'm tireless.
and I'm wireless.

344
00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:33.667
I'm an alpha male on beta-blockers.

345
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.880
I'm a nonbeliever. and an overachiever.
Laid back. but fashion forward.

Rough. tough. and hard to bluff.

It's a pleasure to be here.

386

Robin Williams.

387
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.725
His career spanned about 38 years.

388
00:23:56.059 --> 00:23:59.563
But creatively. he packed in
a few centuries.

389
00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:03.275
Here's what. to me.
separates Robin Williams

390
00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.860
from every other comedian.

391
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:09.447
There is no footage of Robin Williams
phoning it in.

392
00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:14.911
There exists no recorded moment
when he wasn't giving his all.

393
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.914
Whether he was onstage
at the Holy City Zoo.

394
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:19.583
at the Comedy Store.

395
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:22.460
at the Metropolitan Opera House
in New York.

396
00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:26.965
Whether he was onstage co-hosting
<i>Comic Relief </i>for years and years.

397
00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:31.595
Making hundreds of millions of dollars
for medical care for the homeless.

398
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:34.723

yes. give it up for that.

[applause]

400
00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.730
No matter what stage he was on.
he seemed to be immersing himself

401
00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:45.275
completely in the performance.
and he seemed to love it totally.

402
00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:47.736
Robin Williams was also
in more good movies

403
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:50.405
than any human being
should be allowed to be in.

404
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.868
I watched <i>Good Morning. Vietnam</i>
a couple months ago.

405
00:24:54.951 --> 00:25:00.123
And go back and watch that movie.
Watch the first classroom scene

406
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.584
in that movie when Robin
is teaching English

407
00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.002
to the people in Saigon.

408
00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:07.422
I've never seen a performance
where someone is funnier.

409
00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:11.551
and also laughing that genuinely
with people in a scene.

410
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:14.679
It feels like you're watching
this brilliant rehearsal.

411
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:18.350
He's great even in mediocre movies.

412
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:21.269
Remember that movie <i>Nine Months</i>
with Hugh Grant?

413
00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:25.398
Whatever. It's fine. It's all right.
It's not great. It's not great.

414
00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:29.694
But they know that.
Robin Williams...

415
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.113
is in it for 15 minutes.

416
00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:35.825
And he's funnier than most people's
entire body of work.

417
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:38.161
He plays a Russian OB-GYN.

418
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:42.040
In one scene. who used to be
the head of obstetrics

419
00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:45.669
at a hospital in St. Petersburg
for animals.

420
00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:48.588
And he specialized in rats and monkeys.

421
00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:52.801
And he says to Hugh Grant
and Julianne Moore. he goes.

422
00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:56.596
"After awhile. I figured you've seen
one rat ass. you've seen them all."

423
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.641
But then. that's a very funny part.
but then he goes.

424
00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:02.143
he says this with such dignity.

425
00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:06.398
Such quiet understatement.
He goes. "And last month I received

426
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:10.277
my new license.
And now. I can deliver human babies."

427
00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:15.657
If you want to see an actor
simultaneously elevate

428
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.702
what a comedic performance
could be emotionally.

429
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.913
and what an emotional performance
could be comedically.

430
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:25.000
watch Robin Williams
in a movie called <i>The Fisher King.</i>

431
00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:30.297
It is the best work on film
any comic actor has ever done.

432
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.135
Here's an idea that I hear a lot.

433
00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:40.974
Where people like to theorize
that comedy all comes from a place

434
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:43.226
of pain. and sadness.

435
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.647
And people like to talk about comedians
as if we do what we do

436
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.649
because of some inner darkness.

437
00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:54.237
And this is especially thrown around
when discussing Robin Williams.

438
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:58.325
And with all due respect.
fuck off with that shit.

439
00:26:58.408 --> 00:26:59.701
Like...

440
00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:04.873
have a little respect
for a brilliant artist

441
00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:07.500
who was just more talented
than you.

442
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:10.211
That's what was happening.

443
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:14.466
Making people laugh is incredibly fun.

444
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.968
The art form of comedy
is a joy to perform.

445
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:21.264
And being a comedian
is not a psychiatric condition.

446
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:25.101
Are many of us also very fucked up.
myself included?

447
00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:28.271
Yes! But... whatever.

448
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:32.400
You know. there are depressed people
who don't even have the decency

449
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:33.860
to be great comedians.

450
00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.489
Why don't you pick on them
for a change?

451
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:47.582
I was talking to Robin's daughter. Zelda.
about this.

452
00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:51.628
She wrote something back to me
that I wanted to read tonight.

453
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:52.921
If you don't mind.

454
00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.215
This is from Robin's daughter. Zelda.

455
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.884
Talking about this idea. she said.

456
00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:02.514
"This is just one person's perception
of a much more complex man.

457
00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:06.142
But in my eyes.
so much of what Dad wanted to do

458
00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.103
was to brighten people's lives.

459
00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:11.022
Especially those he thought
may need it the most.

460
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.901
In that way. I think his drive
had much less to do with his own sadness.

461
00:28:14.984 --> 00:28:17.445
and much more to do
with lifting the world's.

462
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.698
He'd go to homeless shelters
and sit alone with them for hours.

463
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:24.244
He rode in triathlons
for challenged athletes foundations.

464
00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:27.664
And he would make all the other folks
laugh on the long journey.

465
00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:30.208
He went to hospitals.
He went to army bases.

466
00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:32.419
To anywhere laughter was needed.

467
00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:34.921
He loved knowing that
at the darkest moments.

468
00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:38.425
laughter really is the most incredible
salve for the soul.

469
00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:42.470
And it remains. in my eyes.
one of the hardest. most precious gifts

470
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.389
a human can give another.

471
00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:48.643
My dad truly was happiest
when he was making others happy.

472
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:49.769
Always."

Thank you.

489
00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:46.951
I guess I should talk for a moment
about the very serious subject of...

490
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:49.704
schizophrenia. No. he doesn't.
Shut up. let him talk!

491
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:53.291
My son is three years old.
It's an amazing time.

492
00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:55.543
It's like big head. little tiny body.

493
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.922
It's an outrageous time when they ask you
about everything. It's like...

494
00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:02.175
"Why is the sky blue?"
"Well. because of the atmosphere."

495
00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:04.928
"Why is there atmosphere?"
"Well. because we need to breathe."

496
00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:07.972
"Why do we breathe?"
"Why the fuck do you want to know?"

497
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.141
I always have this dream.

498
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.644
I have this dream. well.
like I guess every father.

499
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:15.146
You have a dream that maybe one day.

500
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.775
one day it'll be my son
accepting the Nobel prize.

501
00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:21.694
I also have another dream
where it's my son going.

502
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.363
"You want fries with this?"

503
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.282
I was on this German talk show.
this woman said to me.

504
00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:29.118
she said. "Mr. Williams.
why do you think there's not so much

505
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:30.703
comedy in Germany?"

506
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:34.123
I said. "Did you ever think
you killed all the funny people?"

507
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.335
But if you're Irish.
you'll kick my ass.

508
00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:39.796

sing about it afterwards.

Here's my idea for a fucking sport.

514
00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:54.269
I knock a ball in a gopher hole.

515
00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:57.897
"Oh. you mean like pool."
Fuck off. pool.

516
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.526
Not with a straight stick.
With a little fucked-up stick.

517
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.363
I whack the ball.
It goes in a gopher hole.

518
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:09.200
"You mean like croquet."
Fuck croquet!

519

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.876

to have a stroke. [chuckles]

Fuck! That's what we'll call it!

we were both on E.

And not the fun kind.

578
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:27.834
I was too young. too confident.
and too arrogant

579
00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:32.046
to believe anyone had a hand
in my success but myself.

580
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.591
Now. I know that
for every success I've had.

581
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:40.221
it was because someone came before me
who was bolder. and braver.

582
00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:45.309
and good luck finding someone as bold
and as brave as Joan Rivers.

[applause]

584
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:56.154
She once said. "Stevie Wonder.
that poor son of a bitch.

585
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:05.454
Who's going to tell him he's wearing
a macramé plant holder on his head?"

586
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.877
And of course. there were the classics.

587
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.549
She also said. "Elizabeth Taylor
is so fat she puts mayonnaise on aspirin."

588
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:23.389
So I am humbled
to stand up here tonight

589
00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:27.143
and pay homage to her life.
and to her work.

590
00:36:27.727 --> 00:36:32.857
Joan was born in 1933
as Joan Alexandra Molinsky.

591
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.527
She was born in Brooklyn. New York.
She started out as many of us did.

592
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.821
working odd jobs to make ends meet.

593
00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:41.824
She was a tour guide
at Rockefeller Center.

594
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:45.286
She worked as a proofreader
at a New York ad agency.

595
00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:49.207
And she also worked for a brief time
as a fashion consultant.

596
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.835
a skill that would come in handy
decades later

597
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:56.464
when she formed the <i>Fashion Police</i>
with her daughter. Melissa.

598
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:05.264
They invented eye rolls
and celebrity smackdowns

599
00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.850
decades before Jada and Will.

600
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:18.778
Joan soon found her home onstage
making people laugh.

601
00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:21.739
Laughing at celebrities.
laughing at politics.

602
00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:24.242
and mostly laughing at herself.

603
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:28.037
She launched her stand-up career
at clubs in Greenwich Village.

604
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.208
Sharing bills with the likes
of George Carlin and Richard Pryor.

605
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:35.211
Joan's routine at the time closed
with the punchline

606
00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:37.463
"I'm Joan Rivers. and I put out."

607
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.301
I think that's a pretty strong opener
as well.

608
00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:47.265
And then. after almost a decade
of struggling in dingy clubs.

609
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:52.144
Joan became an overnight sensation.
After being rejected multiple times.

610
00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:55.564
she was booked on <i>The Tonight Show</i>
<i>Starring Johnny Carson.</i>

612

It was February 17th. 1965.
And that night changed everything.

613
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.995
Johnny Carson sat there wiping tears
of laughter from his cheeks.

614
00:38:09.078 --> 00:38:12.707
and he said. "God. you're funny.
You're going to be a star."

615
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.250
And he was right.

616
00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:15.960
[applause]

617
00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:23.676
She was in command.
and Johnny. the King of Late Night.

618
00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:25.803
was clearly in awe.

619
00:38:25.886 --> 00:38:29.015
She was showing us that you could enter
the boy's club.

620
00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:32.643
and not only leave them laughing.
but if you were funny enough.

621
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.186
you could dominate them.

622
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.814
[cheers and applause]

623
00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:43.321
Joan played Carnegie Hall.
She won a Grammy. She won an Emmy.

624
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:47.366
She earned a Tony nomination.
She wrote 12 best-selling books.

625
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.536
She redefined the red carpet
as we know it today.

626
00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:54.123
And most impressively.
she wasn't afraid to be herself.

627
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.835
Joan found her own acerbic
and trailblazing voice

628
00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:00.004
at a time when women did not speak out.

629
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.632
And when a lot of people get famous.
they become safer.

630
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:05.009
And more guarded.

631
00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:07.428
Because suddenly.
there's too much to lose.

632
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.889
But not Joan.
The more successful she became.

633
00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:12.975
the louder. and the more unapologetic
she was.

634
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:16.562
She pushed boundaries.
and she put everything on the line

635
00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:17.980
for a laugh.

636
00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:20.274
She was criticized her whole life

637
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:24.779
for being too abrasive. too gossipy.
too personal.

638
00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:29.200
But there was always something deeper
under the surface of her jokes.

639
00:39:29.283 --> 00:39:33.954
She refused to apologize for anything.
saying. "Part of my act

640
00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.998
is meant to shake you up.

641
00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:40.795
It looks like I'm being funny.
but I'm reminding you of other things.

642
00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.756
Life is tough. darling.
Life is hard.

643
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.758
And we better laugh at everything.

644
00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:48.344
otherwise we're going straight
down the tube."

[applause]

646
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:56.560
And she didn't just love
making people laugh.

647
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:59.230
She loved people
who made other people laugh.

648
00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:03.526
She once said. "If one more female
comedian comes up to me and says.

649
00:40:03.609 --> 00:40:06.570
'You opened the doors for me.'
I want to say 'Fuck you.

650

00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:14.495
And she still is.

653
00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:17.498
Not even her death in 2014
could stop her.

654

660

and I put out.

661
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:43.899
My wedding night was a disaster
because I have zero-zero.

662
00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:47.403
My husband said.
"Let me help you with the buttons."

663
00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:48.821
And I said...

664
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.323
[laughter]

665
00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:56.745
I said. "I'm naked!"

666

When you're not wanted.
you know from the beginning.

667
00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:02.585

668

"Why can't you be like
your cousin Sheila?

670
00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:09.675
Sheila had died at birth.
Oh. yes!

Anything. right?

674

Second wife. the husband's got
a heart condition.

675

00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:36.702
I was flying.
and I took the plane directly.

682
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.579
Montreal. London.
London. Montreal.

683
00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:41.624
I'm flying back. I thought.
I should have waited till she was dead.

684
00:41:41.707 --> 00:41:43.667
And I was just...

685
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.253
Kissing on the first date.
that wasn't allowed.

686
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.713
-[Joan] Are you kidding?
-That secluded?

687
00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:50.799
-Edgar and I still haven't started.
-[Carson] I didn't know that.

688
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:54.595
If my husband didn't toss and turn in
his sleep. I wouldn't have had the kids.

689
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.722
[laughter and applause]

690
00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:01.685
You know. right?

691
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.107
I can come home from work
with lipstick on my collar.

692
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.484
he couldn't care less.

693
00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:11.695
I pretend I had an affair.
You want to talk about getting him crazy?

694
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:13.781
I thought. "This will get him insane."
Right?

695
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:16.116
We're lying in bed.
I'm pretending I'm talking in my sleep.

696
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.203
and I'm saying things like.
"No. Tim. it's not right!"

697
00:42:19.828 --> 00:42:23.707
"No. Tim. it's not right.
My God. it's just not right."

698
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:27.503
Next morning. my husband left me a note:
"Tell Tim it's all right."

699
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:32.758
We all go through the same thing at 40.
you begin to lose your eyesight.

700
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.344
I don't care who you are.
You can't read the birthday card.

701
00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:38.973
At 50. the memory starts to go.
"Let's go see that movie.

702
00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.350
You know the one.
You know what I'm getting..."

703
00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:44.603
At 60. you start to fart.
You just fart. fart. fart. fart. fart.

704
00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:48.399
Yes. And at 70.
you lose your sense of smell.

705
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:51.819
So between 60 and 70.
it is a terrible time.

706
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:52.945
Oh!

707
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:56.282
[Joan] <i>Everyone watched the </i>Carson Show.

708
00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:59.118
<i>And when Carson said to me.</i>
<i>"You're going to be a star."</i>

709
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:01.620
my life changed.

710
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.998
I'm very sentimental.
Look at the dedication in the book.

711
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.708
-[Carson] I know. it's very sweet of you.
-Yeah.

712
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:06.834
It was very sweet of you.

713
00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:09.003
-You talk about sentiment...
-You didn't have to do that.

714
00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:09.920
It's to...

715
00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:13.591
It says. talks about your baby.
Then you have a dedication.

716
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:14.675
-Can I read it?
-[Joan] Sure.

717
00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.802
-It says. "To Edgar." your husband.
-[Joan] Had to do that.

718
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:19.888
"Who made this book happen.
Who made this book happen.

719
00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:21.557
To Johnny Carson.
who made it all happen."

720
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.767
That's very sweet of you. That's nice.

721
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.187
[Joan] <i>Fox came and offered me</i>
<i>my own show.</i>

722
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.523
<i>And Edgar would be the producer.</i>

723
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.191
<i>Of course we said yes.</i>

724
00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:35.529
<i>After 20 years on </i>The Tonight Show.

725
00:43:37.072 --> 00:43:39.575
<i>the first person I called</i>
<i>was Johnny Carson.</i>

726
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:43.495
He slammed the phone down.
Called him again. slammed it down again.

727
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:47.541
And never spoke to me again. Ever.

728
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.835
Monica Lewinsky. is she here?

729
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:53.339
Look under your chairs.
Monica. my idol!

730
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:57.301
This girl has seven million dollars

731
00:43:57.384 --> 00:44:00.179
from having oral sex
with the President of the United States.

732
00:44:00.262 --> 00:44:01.972
Do you understand what I'm telling you.
Canada?

733
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:04.016
Seven million dollars!

734
00:44:04.099 --> 00:44:05.726
Doesn't that upset you?

735
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.978
If I could do it again...

736
00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:11.482
If I could do it again.
I would say to my daughter.

737
00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:14.485
when she was 16. "Melissa.
come in the den. bring a banana.

738
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:16.945
Get on your knees.
Mama wants to talk to you."

739
00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:19.907
Sometimes. I say to them. "Staff!"

740
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.743
"I'm lonely.

741
00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:26.163
Who's going to fuck me tonight. staff?"

742
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.791
Oh. I'm staring at you.

743
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.878
Look at the person.
Don't look at me.

744
00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:36.507
Look at the person.
This is not fucking hard.

745
00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.258
Look at the person.

746
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:42.179
We're going to say it three times.
This is what life is about.

747
00:44:42.262 --> 00:44:45.516
One. I'm so glad.
Come on. guys.

748
00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:48.102
I'm so glad.

749
00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:50.229
I'm so glad.

750
00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.982
I'm so glad... I'm not you.

751
00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:57.444
Thank you and good night!
A pleasure working with you.

[crowd cheers]

772
00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:22.154
I am here to present tonight's
in memoriam segment.

773
00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:27.075
Because recently. comedy has lost
Norm Macdonald.

774
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.703
Louie Anderson. Bob Saget.

775
00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:32.831
Gilbert Gottfried. and Will Smith.

776
00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.589
Any Gilbert Gottfried fans here tonight?

777
00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:42.382
[crowd cheers]

778
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:46.220
I loved Gilbert.

779
00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:51.141
I did get to see Gilbert in the hospital
right before he passed away.

780
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:54.770
I'm glad I got the chance to thank him
for being my pal.

781
00:46:54.853 --> 00:46:57.481
And I held his hand.
and I said goodbye.

782
00:46:57.564 --> 00:47:01.652
It was hard for the doctors
to pronounce an exact time of death.

783
00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:04.947
Because Gilbert's eyes were always
kind of closed.

784
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:15.249
I was doing a show for Netflix
where I roast historical figures.

785
00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:18.961
And I called Gilbert's agent.
and I said. "I need Gilbert to come out

786
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:21.713
to LA and play Adolf Hitler."

787
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:28.095
And his agent said. "No way.
It's not appropriate.

788
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:32.307
Gilbert's first time on Netflix
is not going to be playing Adolf Hitler."

789
00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:35.852
So I called Gil myself. and I said.

790
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.814
"Gilbert. I need someone
to play Adolf Hit--"

791
00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:41.149
And he went. "Ler?

792
00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:43.277
I'll do it!"

793
00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:49.199
And he flew out.
We sent him into wardrobe.

794
00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:52.286
And Gilbert came to rehearsal
with a <i>lederhosen.</i>

795
00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:57.374
and a Hitler mustache.
and a swastika armband.

796
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.167
Then. we broke for lunch.

797
00:47:59.251 --> 00:48:02.170
and Gilbert was still wearing
the swastika armband.

798
00:48:02.254 --> 00:48:04.172
And we did the show.

799
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.050
We went to the after-party.
and I couldn't get him

800
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:09.344
to take the swastika armband off.

801
00:48:11.763 --> 00:48:14.474
I think he wore it on the plane home
the next day.

802
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.104
But he was so funny that night.
And let me tell you something.

803
00:48:19.187 --> 00:48:22.566
Gilbert Gottfried was the best
Hitler ever.

804
00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:29.281
Mel Brooks once said that comedy
is revenge through ridicule.

805
00:48:29.364 --> 00:48:34.703
What better way to mock the Nazis
then have their <i>führer </i>played by

806
00:48:34.786 --> 00:48:37.956
the loudest. most obnoxious Jew
in history.

807
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.417
So... <i>Heil </i>Gilbert!

808
00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:47.341
Any Louie Anderson fans here?

809
00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.092
[crowd cheers]

810
00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:52.971
What an original voice in comedy.

811
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:57.100
Louie Anderson turned his childhood
pain into concert tours.

812
00:48:57.184 --> 00:49:02.105
TV specials. and animated shows.
And he made it all hilarious.

813
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:06.485
Louie gave us a way in to look.
and laugh at our own childhoods.

814
00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:10.197
He was also a recent Emmy winner.
a best-selling author.

815
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.115
a hit game show host.

816
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:15.160
and a spokesman for Land-O-Lakes butter.

817
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:18.622
Both officially and unofficially.

818
00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:26.254
The first time I met Louie Anderson.
we were both standing at adjoining urinals

819
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:28.924
in a men's room at a comedy club
in New York.

820
00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:31.551
I was 24-year-old open micer.

821
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:34.763
and I'm pretty sure Louie
propositioned me.

822
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:40.352
And I'm not going to spill secrets here.
but let's just say.

823
00:49:40.435 --> 00:49:42.521
I've been a huge fan ever since.

824
00:49:43.855 --> 00:49:46.191
We're so lucky Louie shared his life
with us.

825
00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:48.694
Life without Lilly won't be the same.

826
00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:50.529
Long live Lilly Anderson.

827
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:52.489
[applause]

828
00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.163
I know we got some Norm Macdonald fans
here tonight.

829
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.790
[crowd cheers]

830
00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:08.588
Norm had so many jokes
that I think about all the time.

831
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:11.216
Whenever daylight savings time
rolled around.

832
00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:14.678
Norm would always say.
"I give it six months."

833
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:20.726
Norm got fired from <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
for making too many jokes

834
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:22.144
about O.J. Simpson.

835
00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:26.106
But comedians are supposed
to tell the truth

836
00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:28.358
no matter what the consequences.

837
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:30.652
And that's what Norm did.

838
00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:33.905
I just wish he'd told us the truth
about his health.

839
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:37.159
We all would have been able to tell him
how much we loved him.

840
00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:39.703
But that wasn't Norm's way.

841
00:50:39.786 --> 00:50:43.081
He was always one step ahead of us
right up until the end.

842
00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:45.500
I'm going to miss that guy.

843
00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.503
Where are my Bob Saget fans?

844
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.338
[crowd cheers]

845
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.972
Bob was like my brother.

846
00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:00.682
But he was America's dad.

847
00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:02.434
Like Bill Cosby.

848
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:08.106
Except Bob put people to sleep
the old-fashioned way.

849
00:51:10.275 --> 00:51:12.652
By talking about his charity work.

850
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.033
Bob's wife. John Stamos.
told me about how...

851
00:51:19.826 --> 00:51:22.704
how fans would stop Bob
all the time.

852
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.080
They'd want to hug him.

853
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:27.000
They'd get emotional.
and they'd say things to Bob like.

854
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:31.338
"I didn't... I grew up without a dad.
and your character on <i>Full House.</i>

855
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:34.508
Danny Tanner. he was like my dad.
so thank you."

856
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:37.844
And in his honor.
please donate if you can

857
00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:40.263
to the Scleroderma Research Foundation.

858
00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:43.391
A cause that meant so much to Bob.

859
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:47.562
Bob was so strong. and so supportive
when life got hard.

860
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.316
I hope everyone here
has a friend like Bob.

861
00:51:52.317 --> 00:51:57.239
He was this gigantic TV star.
but he lived his life like a comedian.

862
00:51:57.572 --> 00:52:02.118
He even died like a comic
on the road. alone. in a hotel room.

863
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.955
He slipped and hit his head.

864
00:52:05.705 --> 00:52:10.752
Which is kind of poetic for a guy
who hosted <i>America's Funniest Home Videos.</i>

865
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:23.974
If Bob were here. he'd be like.
"Can I use that? That's good."

866
00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.936
[crowd cheers]

867
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:30.522
Thanks.

868
00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:32.941
[applause]

869
00:52:35.902 --> 00:52:38.780
These four future Hall of Famers
may be gone.

870
00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:40.407
but their laughs live on.

871
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.579
So let's all give it up one last time
for Gilbert. Louie. Norm. and Bob.

872
00:52:46.204 --> 00:52:47.956
[cheers and applause]

873
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:56.506
Whoo!

874
00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:01.261
And now. it is my great honor
to welcome "The Closer."

875
00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.388

I don't know how you get to be

887
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.965
but you lucky motherfuckers.

888
00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:41.885
-[man 1] Dave!
-[man 2] We love you. Dave!

889
00:53:41.968 --> 00:53:43.303
Hey. thanks. buddy.

890
00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:48.892
I love you too. in a very impersonal.
heterosexual kind of way.

891
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.192
I got a heavy lift tonight because
it's my honor to get to...

892
00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:58.944
to induct the GOAT.

893
00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:02.030
[cheers and applause]

894
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:05.992
Richard Pryor.

895
00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.578
Richard Pryor.

896
00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:10.372
[cheers and applause]

897
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:16.252
The greatest stand-up comedian
that ever lived.

898
00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:24.219
Not to make it personal.
but comedians love Richard Pryor.

899
00:54:24.302 --> 00:54:28.056
There's a story that we always revel in
of him walking off stage

900
00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:30.475
in Las Vegas in the middle of a show.

901
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:31.977
And when he did it.

902
00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:36.064
whoever promoted the show told him
he'd never work in Vegas again.

903
00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:37.273
And he said. "I don't care."

904
00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:40.527
He said. "If you said I'd never fuck
in Vegas again. I'd be worried."

905
00:54:46.658 --> 00:54:50.120
Abruptly. he left show business
and went into the unknown

906
00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:53.415
of what his future might be.
And it took him to San Francisco.

907
00:54:53.498 --> 00:54:56.668
And with the help of Paul Mooney.
and some other people.

908
00:54:56.751 --> 00:55:02.132
he started doing all-Black rooms.
and slowly but surely.

909
00:55:02.215 --> 00:55:05.760
he became the Richard Pryor
that we've come to love.

910
00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:09.514
It wasn't just Black rooms that he was
doing that made that transformation.

911
00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:10.932
It was cocaine.

912
00:55:16.896 --> 00:55:19.858
Sometimes. I'll see a comedian
have a great joke. and I'll say.

913
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:21.359
"Man. I wish I wrote that joke."

914
00:55:21.443 --> 00:55:23.445
But the joke will be
about something personal.

915
00:55:23.528 --> 00:55:26.406
I know that that person lived
through something very difficult

916
00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.993
to be able to say something that funny
about their own life.

917
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:32.078
Richard Pryor was like that.

918
00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.080
When I was 19. I remember.

919
00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:38.334
I did an event that he attended
at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.

920
00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.545
And I came in as he was coming in.

921
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:43.006
They were wheeling him
in a wheelchair.

922
00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:45.341
I was standing behind him.
I didn't say one word to him.

923
00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:47.218
But I looked behind his ear.

924
00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:51.389
And I could see the scars
from when he burnt himself.

925
00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.975
And it made me want to cry.

926
00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.645
Not long after that.
I opened for him.

927
00:55:57.729 --> 00:56:00.356
At Newark Symphony Hall.

928
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.360
I couldn't believe that he was a legend
doing a gig in Newark.

929
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:09.407
I met him backstage.

930
00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.160
He remembered my name.
shook my hand.

931
00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:17.082
And he came out to the eeriest song.
It was a song called "I'm Calling You."

932
00:56:17.665 --> 00:56:20.376
And he did about 15 minutes.

933
00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.587
And he stopped talking.

934
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.924
And he told the crowd. "I'm sorry.
I just can't do this tonight."

935
00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:30.386
And you could have heard a pin drop
in that room.

936
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.931
And a guy in the back stood up

937
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:37.644
and screamed out like he wanted to fight.
He said. "I love you. Richard!"

938
00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:40.522
The whole crowd went crazy.

939
00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:44.484
I mean. this was sincerely the longest
ovation I've ever seen

940
00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:47.278
to this day in comedy.
And I was a young man.

941
00:56:47.362 --> 00:56:50.782
but I understood that I was witnessing
actual love.

942
00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:54.869
That it didn't matter if he did good or
bad. they just wanted to be around him

943
00:56:54.953 --> 00:56:56.079
one more time.

944
00:56:56.162 --> 00:56:59.582
And they sent him off lovely.
And said a great goodbye.

945
00:56:59.874 --> 00:57:03.628
And the moment that I saw that.
it informed the rest of my career.

946
00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:06.756
I knew that's exactly what I wanted
for my life.

947
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.967
And that's exactly how I want
my career to end.

948
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.426
Well. maybe not exactly.

949
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:13.680
Not in Newark.

950
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.316
Paul Mooney was a big influence
on me as well.

951
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.402
And...

952
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:29.571
[cheers and applause]

953
00:57:31.906 --> 00:57:34.701
And he used to regale me
with stories of Richard.

954
00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:38.705
And the way he talked about Richard
was like he was in the next room.

955
00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.541
You know what I mean?
It was something very familiar

956
00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:46.463
and comforting hearing a guy
talk about his friend that way.

957
00:57:46.546 --> 00:57:49.507
I was very lucky
to get to know him too.

958
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:52.760
I don't want to blather
about my own personal stories. but...

959
00:57:52.844 --> 00:57:55.096
I just want to say that
without Richard Pryor

960
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.099
there would be no.
there would be no Dave Chappelle.

961
00:57:58.183 --> 00:58:02.187
And all you comedians out there
who complain that you can't say anything

962
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.357
nowadays. I would suggest that perhaps.
you have nothing to say.

963
00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:09.527
Because there's a very profound example
of a person

964
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:12.155
who said anything and everything
he wanted to say

965
00:58:12.238 --> 00:58:13.656
outside of context.

966
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.367
There was only three channels
when that nigga was working.

967
00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:26.044
There's nothing to be afraid of.

968
00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:28.421
If you saw a person be this courageous

969
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:31.758
at such a high price.
So please. ladies and gentlemen.

970
00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:34.844
make some noise for Richard Pryor.

971
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:37.305
[cheers and applause]

972
00:58:40.642 --> 00:58:43.561
Now you know. I have read that
you were born in a brothel.

973
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:46.147
And I figured this is Pryor
putting on an interviewer.

974
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:48.733
No. I was born in my mother's womb.

975
00:58:48.816 --> 00:58:49.776
[Dick] Well. yes.

976
00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.862
And we lived in--
I guess you'd call it a brothel.

977
00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:55.490
-We called it a whorehouse.
-[Dick] Yeah.

978
00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:57.659
Whorehouse or...

979
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:01.871
-Or--
-But it was home to me!

980
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.414
It was... [laughs]

981
00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:08.795
I remember tricks used to come
through our neighborhood.

982
00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:10.713
That's where I first met white people.

983
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:13.675
They come down through our neighborhood
to help the economy.

984
00:59:14.592 --> 00:59:17.512
Nice white dudes. though.
Because I could have been a bigot.

985
00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:18.846
You know what I mean?

986
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:21.182
I could have been prejudiced.

987
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:27.355
I could have been prejudiced.

988
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:30.483
I could have been. man.
but I met nice white men.

989
00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:33.861
Come up. "Hello. little boy.
Is your mother home? I'd like a blowjob."

990
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:36.656
My mother. I met my mother.
She's sitting out there.

991
00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.449
I love her. That's my mother.

992
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:39.367
[applause]

993
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.786
-[interviewer] Is she here?
-Come on. Ma! Don't hide your face!

994
00:59:42.537 --> 00:59:43.621
Get up there!

995
00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:44.998
[interviewer] I didn't know that.

996
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.541
[Pryor] Don't cry. Ma.

997
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:50.420
My grandmother's the lady
who used to discipline me. right?

998
00:59:50.503 --> 00:59:52.213
You know. beat my ass.

999
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:55.258
Anyone here remember them switches?

1000
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:58.845
You... right?
You used to have to go get off the tree

1001
00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:01.806
yourself. and take them leaves like that.

1002
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.935
I see them trees today.
I will kill one of them motherfuckers.

1003
01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.647
And you get them switches.
and they start cutting wind

1004
01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.775
on the way home.
You hear. phew. phew.

1005
01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.403
Make you start crying
before you get in the house.

1006
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.363
Phew. phew. Mama!

1007
01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:24.829
Phew. phew! I'm sorry. Mama.
I'll never play...

1008
01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:27.040
Mama. please! Mama. please!

1009
01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.042
Please. Mama! Please. Mama!

1010
01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.712
Ow. please. Mama! Ow. please. Ma!

1011
01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:34.589
Are you big in Europe?

1012
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.258
What's the matter?

1013
01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.428
That's a legitimate question.

1014
01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:44.307
Gee. he really thinks I'm great.

1015
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.017
-Just a moment.
-He thinks I'm funny.

1016
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.977
-Just a moment.
-I got the laugh. not you.

1017
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.688
-Just a moment.
-What do you mean. just a moment?

1018
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.441
Sometimes. pain is funny later on.

1019
01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.943
You know what I mean?
Like when I was in jail.

1020
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:58.529
I was in jail for income tax evasion.

1021
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.907
-When?
-Last year.

1022
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.911
-How much time did you get?
-I got enough.

1023
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.498
I told the judge. I said.
"I forgot about my taxes."

1024
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.750
He said.
"You'll remember next year. nigga."

1025
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.337
And when you don't use sensitivity
when you're having sex. right?

1026
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.964
Or share some of your soul.
nothing is going to happen.

1027
01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:21.135
Because men really get afraid.
Men are really scared in bed with a woman.

1028
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:26.974
You got to have that macho shit working.
It's hard to say. "Did...

1029
01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.895
Did you. did you...

1030
01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.148
Did you uh...

1031
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.026
Did you cum?

1032
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.947
Did you?"

1033
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.576
Because men get defensive if a woman says
she didn't cum.

1034
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.328
Men get real defensive. right?

1035
01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.497
They won't take no fault for shit. right?

1036
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.959
Men might say anything when they get
scared. right? Men go.

1037
01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.753
"Look. baby. maybe your pussy dead."

1038
01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.763
And women always have a great comeback.
right? Women say.

1039
01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.641
"Well. why don't you give it
mouth to mouth resuscitation?"

1040
01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:11.519
[cheers and applause]

1041
01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.189
-I have sinned.
-[Carson] Oh. no.

1042
01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:20.194
-In the past. And many. many--
-Heal!

1043
01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:23.948
You're the only white man alive
that's ever touched my head

1044
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.533
without being killed.

1045
01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.000
[Pryor] Ali. man. I got in the ring
one time. Ali. man. is awesome.

1046
01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.878
The nigga. I was in a benefit with him
just for fun. boxing.

1047
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:40.131
And just to get in the ring
with a nigga. your heart go... [shudders]

1048
01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:45.428
No. because something make you say.
I'm in this motherfucking ring and shit.

1049
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:47.930
Does everybody know this is for fun?

1050
01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.225
The nigga be fucking with you. right?
As soon as you get in the ring.

1051
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.728
Ali be talking about...
[mouthing words]

1052
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:59.066
I said. "Wait a minute.
Does this nigga know it's a benefit?

1053
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.195
He ain't supposed to hit my ass up
in this motherfucker."

1054
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.781
And the nigga's so fast.

1055
01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.617
you don't see his punches
till they coming back.

1056
01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.662
That's all you see. right?
And your mind be saying.

1057
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.872
"Wait a minute. now.

1058
01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:16.042
There was some shit in my face
a minute ago. I know that."

1059
01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.505
Then the coach say.
"Stick and move! Stick and move!"

1060
01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:23.925
And you be scared when you have
your first boxing-- Right? You be doing...

1061
01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.726
-Have you seen <i>The Exorcist?</i>
-Ah!

1062
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:41.609
And women won't go to the bathroom
outside. right?

1063
01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:43.069
Ladies. you won't. will you?

1064
01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.946
"You want to go to the bathroom
out here. baby?"

1065
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:46.072
"Uh-uh."

1066
01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.116
"Nope. Too much. Look. no. Uh-uh.

1067
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.119
Too many things crawling around
could crawl up there. No.

1068
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.414
I'll wait till we get back to the car."

1069
01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.709
I say. "Bitch. you ain't gonna piss
in the car!

1070
01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:06.217
You better drop your drawers
and piss here."

1071
01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:12.473
"I gotta go real bad. too.
Okay. I'm going to pull my panties down

1072
01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:13.933
a little bit.

1073
01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:17.812
Okay? Now. don't you do nothing.
Don't you be funny.

1074
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.815
If you see something.
you let me know.

1075
01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.861
You're not going to do nothing funny.
are you?"

1076
01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:27.363
"No. baby. Go ahead.
I ain't gonna do nothing. Go ahead."

1077
01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:29.657
"Okay. I'll just pull it down
a little bit."

1078
01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.919
I like to wait till they get into it.
right?

1079
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.796
You go. "Somebody's coming!"

1080
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.135
I remember that's where I met
Louie Armstrong.

1081
01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:52.013
I walked in his dressing room.
I said. "How you doing. Louie?"

1082
01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.682
He said. "White folks still in the lead."

1083
01:04:57.268 --> 01:05:00.271
Don't go out with the Mafia.
You can't buy them dinner.

1084
01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:01.439
The motherfuckers like.

1085
01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.232
they always like to take entertainers
to dinner.

1086
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:06.694
And they take you to dinner.
and they pick up the check all the time.

1087
01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:10.156
Right? And if you get mad.
you say. "Let me buy the check tonight.

1088
01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:12.325
Goddamn it. you guys buy me dinner
every night."

1089
01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:18.372
"Hey. kid. Let me tell you something.
We're crime.

1090
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.417
And crime don't pay."

1091
01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:27.423
Anyone here ever had a heart attack?

1092
01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:28.883
Them motherfuckers hurt!

1093
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.720
I'm not bullshitting. man.
I was walking in the front yard.

1094
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:36.349
I was just walking along.
and something said. "Don't breathe!"

1095
01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.393
I'm saying. hmm?

1096
01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.938
"You heard me. motherfucker.
I said don't breathe!"

1097
01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.231
"Okay. I won't breathe. I won't breathe.
I won't."

1098
01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:48.986
"Then shut the fuck up then."
"Okay. I'm sorry. Don't kill me."

1099
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:52.031
"Get on one knee and prove it."
"I won't get up."

1100
01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:54.617
"Don't kill me. don't..."
"You thinking about dying now. ain't you?"

1101
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.327
"Yeah. I'm thinking about dying."

1102
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.163
"You didn't think about it
when you was eating all that pork."

1103
01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:00.206
"I wasn't."

1104
01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.589
I woke up in an ambulance. right?

1105
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:11.717
And it wasn't nothing
but white people staring at me.

1106
01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.054
I said. "Ain't this a bitch.

1107
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:19.934
I've done died and wound up
in the wrong motherfucking heaven."

1108
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.648
Now listen to me. All the people
you ever heard of freebasing.

1109
01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:28.150
have you ever heard
of anybody blowing up?

1110
01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:30.903
Why me?

1111
01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.825
Ten million motherfuckers freebase.
I got to blow up.

1112
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.581
I want to say y'all gave me
a lot of love when I was...

1113
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.668
not feeling well.
And y'all really. I appreciate it.

1114
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:48.254
-Also. y'all did some... also...
-[applause]

1115
01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.422
Yeah. applaud yourself.

1116
01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:53.759
[applause]

1117
01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.388
Also. y'all did some nasty ass jokes
on my ass too.

1118
01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.475
Oh. yeah. Y'all didn't think
I saw some of these motherfuckers.

1119
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.561
Since you love me so much.

1120
01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:06.063
I remember this one.
Strike the match like this.

1121
01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.858
What's that? Richard Pryor running
down the street.

1122
01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:12.903
I was watching TV one night.
and they said I had died.

1123
01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.781
I was bandaged up and shit.

1124
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.242
They said. "Richard Pryor died
five minutes ago."

1125
01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:20.619
[muffled mumbling]

1126
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.666
Now. what makes me angry
is the fact that

1127
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.670
across the board. in my mind.
there's nobody I've ever met

1128
01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:34.175
in the business of comedy
who was any more brilliant than me.

1129
01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:38.054
And I will never get the recognition
for what I do.

1130
01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.432
[cheers and applause]

1131
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.147
He called that one wrong. didn't he?

1132
01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:53.652
In 2016. I did my first Netflix special
in this very room.

1133
01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:54.570
It was March 12th.

1134
01:07:54.653 --> 01:07:57.740
the anniversary of when
<i>Richard Pryor: Live on Sunset Strip</i>

1135
01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:02.203
was released in theaters.
which he shot in this very room.

1136
01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:06.373
It was Easter weekend. when people
celebrate Jesus rising from the dead.

1137
01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:09.627
And when he shot that special.
he had burnt himself on fire.

1138
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.004
It was his first time back
in front of the public

1139
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.547
after that terrible incident.

1140
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:16.050
And it was my first time back
in the public

1141
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:19.136
after that nasty spill
I took on television.

1142
01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:23.015
It's an honor to be here tonight.

1143
01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:25.267
