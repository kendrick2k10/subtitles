00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.402
Miss Draygon.
I've put on

173
00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.237
dozens of shows
just like this.

174
00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.406
And that's the way it goes.
right up to the last moment.

175
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.117
Now. I would suggest
that you run your park.

176
00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:42.410
Let me run my concert.

177
00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:03.055
Hey. Drew.
What happened
to you. cowboy?

178
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.099
You look like
you just saw
a ghost.

179
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.560
Flesh. blood.

180
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.771
LUKE: Where's Harvey. Drew?
Where's my brother?

181
00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.399
Your brother is dead. man.

182
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.442
LUKE: No!

183
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.193
Oh. God.

184
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:20.114
-How big did you say
that bear was?
-DREW: Big as this tree.

185
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.325
If it were that big. it'd
probably bring a lot of money.
don't you...

186
00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:25.286
Bear that big

187
00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:27.747
would bring 100.000
bucks in Frisco.

188
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:30.124
My brother's dead.
you're talking about money?

189
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.627
-Goddamn you.
-Well. let's go
get the bear.

190
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.463
He's right. Luke.
Your brother's dead.

191
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:41.135
You know. Luke.
uh. $25.000 apiece.

192
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.470
Let's go get
the bear. okay?

NICK: The hell you think
happened here?

195
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:48.684
PETE: Bear gall bladder.

196
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:50.519
NICK: What?

197
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.646
PETE: It's something
poachers go far.

198
00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:56.525
They sell it to dealers
in San Francisco's Chinatown.

199
00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:01.155
Some people think that
bear gall bladder
has aphrodisiac powers.

200
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.783
Anyway. they sure
get a good price for it.

201
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.670
Sam's gonna
hit the roof.

202
00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:19.465
There ain't nothing
she hates more than
people killing animals.

203
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.842
A bear cub
at that.

204
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.557
-NICK: That's a bear track.
-Yeah.

205
00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:29.850
That thing's enormous.

206
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:33.145
Well. what do you
want to do?

207
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:35.356
We're gonna track
this grizzly and we're
gonna kill it.

208
00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.566
A handful of men?

209
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:42.321
-Nick. this park covers
more than 3000 square miles.
-I know that.

210
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.700
I'm gonna get more men
out of Draygon.

211
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.892
Miss Draygon. There's been
an incident over at
Holbrook Valley.

212
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.352
I think we better
talk about it.

213
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.896
I don't have time
to talk about it now.

214
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.606
Time  magazine has arrived.

215
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:21.735
A man has been killed
by a grizzly. apparently
a very large one.

216
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.904
I just can't talk
about it now.

217
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:24.864
I don't think
you understand.

218
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:29.410
We have a special situation
here between the concert
and this killing.

219
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.203
You have
to deal with it.

220
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.580
And don't talk to the press.

221
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:38.627
Well. my security guys
will be stationed

222
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.254
mainly in front
of the stage

223
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.924
to protect my performers
from those animals
out there.

224
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.428
And. uh. sometimes.
they got to go out
in the audience.

225
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:50.764
stop a fight. you know.
But they don't have
any official status.

226
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:53.767
They don't carry any weapons
and they can't arrest anyone.

227
00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.644
How many men
did you bring?

228
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.229
For this one.
we got...

229
00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:01.942
Hey. Bernie. How much
muscle did we hire?

230
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:05.321
-Oh. I'll say
about 50. Charlie.
-50.

231
00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:06.655
We'll be short men.

232
00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:09.825

will be okay.

are okay. no?

-On your wings.
-MAN: Yeah.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.254
Excuse me.

239
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:26.759
When I found out
you hired my
daughter. Chrissy...

240
00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:30.346
Chrissy? Chrissy's
your daughter?

241
00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:31.639
-Yeah.
-You're kidding.

242
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.183
-No.
-Wow.

243
00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:35.851
-Nice girl.
-Yeah. she's a good kid.

244
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.978
I mean. her mother's
not around to take
care of her anymore.

245
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.647
You know. I'd
like her to...

246
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.315
well. stay a nice kid.
you know?

247
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:43.817

She's. uh...

248
00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:47.196
she's young. She's cute.
She's having a ball out here.

249
00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:48.697
Look. I'm gonna
keep a special
eye on her.

250
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.199
You'll keep a special
eye on her.

-You're a go-fer.

-You go for this.
you go for that.

-You go for your old man?
-Mm-hmm. in a big way.

-Oh. yeah? Let me have a kiss.
-Mm.

Listen. Chrissy.

262
00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:19.353
-I've always trusted you.
-Mm-hmm.

263
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.355
That's because you've
never given me a reason
not to trust you.

264
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.400
It's these guys
that I don't trust.

any kind of problem.

Please listen
to me carefully.

279
00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:35.304
The grizzly we're
seeking is huge.

280
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:39.558
obviously powerful
and probably enraged.

281
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.476
If you spot her.

282
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:44.813
keep your distance
and fire one of these
tranquilizer darts into her.

283
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:50.444
Use bullets for
self-defense only.

284
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:53.113
A grizzly of this size
would have such
a thick skull

285
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.449
that an ordinary bullet
might not stop her anyway.

286
00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:59.953
The second you spot her.
radio the rest of the unit

287
00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:02.456

description of where
you're located.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:21.850
-Want some coffee?
-Sam. look. I know how
you feel about the grizzlies.

293
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.811
Each grizzly is precious.

294
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.440
If it's wounded.

295
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.485
it has to be nursed
back to health.

296
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:35.656
We locate it.
we tranquilize it.
we relocate it.

297
00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:37.116
That's the procedure.

298
00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:39.493
You can't let
this bear roam around.

299
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.120
-You can't
relocate your animal.
-You try to...

Will you try to understand
what has happened here?

301
00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.874
Sal has reared her cub
for a year and a half.

302
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:50.671
and then some bastard
trucked out here
and butchered it?

303
00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:52.506
The sow found him
and killed him.

304
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.507
That's nature.

305
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.717
That's even human nature.

306
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.853
One single sow

307
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:12.526
represents perhaps five percent
of the next generation's
grizzlies in this park.

308
00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:15.404
You want to destroy that?

309
00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:16.864
That's not what
I wanna do. Sam.

310
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.699
I just don't want
anyone else killed.

311
00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.877
If someone murdered Chrissy

312
00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:33.213
when she was a baby.
how would you feel?

313
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.175
Mm? What would
you have done?

314
00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.552
All right. listen.

315
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.303
Whether you're
gonna use tranquilizers.

316
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:42.055
whether you're
gonna use bullets.
it doesn't matter.

317
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.098
because we have
another problem.

318
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.516

where the bear is.

a dozen warning signs.

322
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.617
God. why didn't they
pay attention?

323
00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:05.078
-We found a third body.
-Mutilated like the other two?

324
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.580
Yeah.

325
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.582
The grizzly's wounded.

326
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:11.084
She's got to be.
It's the only explanation.

327
00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:13.086
We also found
some broken branches

328
00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:15.047
a good 18 feet
off the ground.

329
00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:16.256
Wait a minute.

330
00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.091
That makes this
bear awful big.

331
00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:22.095
Yeah. This could be one
of the times when
we call in Bouchard.

332
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:24.973
-Who's Bouchard?
-A French Indian guy.

grizzly trapper to ever live.

334
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.936
Yeah. I know him.

335
00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:30.938
He's one of the cruelest
grizzly trappers.

336
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.272
Depends how you
look at it.

337
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.233
One thing's for certain.

338
00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:36.109
This Bouchard.
