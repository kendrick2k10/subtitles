- Huh?

16
00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.726
- Well. there's a reason
I sit in the backseat

17
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.766
on car trips after dark.

18
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.226

20
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.446
Your nose is all up in that romance novel.

- Nah. this one's got vampires. (laughs)

22
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.066

deer hit my family's car

26
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.876

home from Christmas one year.

I told you that story. right?

28
00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.806
Do you want one?

29
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.236
It's so weird. I never even
liked these things before.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.716

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.486
How is Shiloh adjusting?

32
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.146

kid. but lord is she messy.

33
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.276

Emma called last night.

35
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.856

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.706
for a little while. and
would I take Shiloh.

37
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.933

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.703
She was right there.

her. I mean. I love kids.

(thrilling music)

74
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.523

75
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.786
- You mean. you see him too?

76
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.676
- Yeah. I think I've seen him before.

77
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.866
- [Ginny] Well. what's
he doin' on the road?

78
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.040
Did his car break down?

79
00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:12.906
- Guys?

80
00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:17.520

84
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.303
- Oh my god. she's bleeding!

85
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.053
We have to stop somewhere.

86
00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:34.915
Okay.

87
00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.179
- This is your fault. you know.

88
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.370
You should have been
paying better attention.

89
00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:46.617

93
00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:21.063

leaking into your daddy's

109
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.913
old office again.

110
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.792
- You need a ride to work today?

111
00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:23.896
- No. I didn't get any sleep last night.

112
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.923
I'm not goin' in.

113
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.720
- You just started this job.

114
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.896
Are you scared of making a bad impression

115
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.993
like the last one?

116
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.666
- You were up late last
night. I heard voices.

117
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.655
- I was talking to Emily on Skype.

118
00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.016
- Oh.

119
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.790
I'm glad you two are still friends.

120
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.733
- Why wouldn't we be?

121
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.386
- I just know it's not easy

122
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.806
maintaining long distance friendships.

123
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.936
I wish I could have afforded to

124
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.093
send you to New York like her parents did.

125
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.370
I know you'd be happier.

126
00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:05.087
(microwave beeping)

127
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:06.283
- Not this again. Mom.

128
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.946
- If your daddy were still alive...

129
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.970
- But he's not.

130
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.076
- Look. I just wanna make sure
that you're gonna be okay.

131
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.586
We both have to save
every penny we've got.

132
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.756
And I want to know I'm gonna
be taken care of in my old age.

133
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.019
- You're too young to
be worried about that.

134
00:12:28.043 --> 00:12:29.076
(laughs)

135
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.033
- You're never too young to
be worried about your future.

136
00:12:33.756 --> 00:12:35.756
(sighs)

137
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.870
One day.

138
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.214
when you get married and have a house.

139
00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:45.257
are you gonna let me
come live with you. hm?

140
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.093
- Why don't we just cross
that bridge when we get there?

141
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.056
Honestly. I've never seen
somebody in such a hurry

142
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.934
to become elderly.

143
00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.296
(ringing)

144
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320
- There's my bacon.

145
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.570
- And that's my cue.

146
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.780
I don't wanna be late.

147
00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.813
(keys rattling)
- Love you. sweetie.

148
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.380
- I love you too.

149
00:13:14.965 --> 00:13:17.882
(doorbell dinging)

150
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.896
- Hey. listen. do you think you could

151
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.146
take over my cafeteria duty today?

152
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.496
- An audition?

153
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.506
- Yeah.

154
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.836
- Okay. look. I would but
I just got into my new

155
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.876
doctor's office. and they squeezed me

156
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.646
in for an appointment this afternoon.

157
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.670
- Damn.

158
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.586
- No. no. no. no.

159
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.496
I am out of here before lunch.

160
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.306
and I have a spa
appointment already booked.

161
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.267
Not happening.

162
00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:52.876
- Oh. come on. please. look.

163
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.256
I'll sub for one of your classes.

164
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.280
And I'll treat you to a
spa day if I get the part.

165
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.677
(sighs)

166
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:06.336
- Okay. fine.
- Okay!

167
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.476

Everything included. right?

170
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.386
- Yes. absolutely. I'll do it. thank you.

171
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.220
- You're welcome. honey.

172
00:14:18.244 --> 00:14:20.983
And you can stop kissing
my ask. you got your way.

173
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.666
- Amanda. what's up. shouldn't
you be in first period?

174
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.806
- I didn't know what to do

175
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.316
so I thought I'd just
bring it to you guys.

176
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.526
- What's the matter. sweetie?

177
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.016
- Mitchell Mayer posted this
on his Instagram last night.

178
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.733
I think it might be some kind of a threat.

179
00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.917
- [Mitchell Recording] But
this shall be your punishment.

180
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.472
I will take great pleasure
in slaughtering you.

181
00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:43.943
All of you.

182
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.040
You will finally see that I
am not a mouse. but a god!

183
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.373
- Mitchell. what is this?

184
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.123
You know you're being accused
of some very serious things.

185
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.500
- Mitchell. you threatened people's lives.

186
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.346
- Henry. let me handle this.

187
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.086
Look. I remember what it's
like being a kid your age.

188
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.416
Girls thought you were weird.

189
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.523
They wouldn't go to prom
with ya. it really sucks.

190
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.356
I didn't even lose my
virginity until I was 24.

191
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.823
It was this time where we ran down to.

192
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.676
Okay. well. not really sure
why I'm telling you this.

193
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.854
The point is. you cannot
post stuff like this.

194
00:15:33.878 --> 00:15:35.566
- It was just a prank.

195
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.826
- A prank?

196
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.250
- Why would someone make
something like that up?

197
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.986
- I don't know. Mr. Lyle.

198
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.043
They'd have to be pretty
sick. wouldn't they?

199
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.196
- No. they'd be suspended
just like you are right now.

200
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.253
I'm calling your parents.
clear out your locker.

201
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:04.241
(suspenseful music)

202
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.376
(door slamming)

203
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.006
- I think we should call the police.

204
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.866
- Ah. it's gone to voicemail.

205
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.806
You know. I went to
school with his parents.

206
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.576
It wouldn't surprise me if they
were on the couch right now

207
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.346
baked out of their minds.

208
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.046
- Mr. Blakely. I really think
we should call the police.

209
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.226
- Ah. don't worry about it.

210
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.756
I don't think he'll pull
any shit like that again.

211
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.516
Now if you'll excuse me. I have
another phone call to make.

212
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.176
Apparently a parent got
offended at a recent production

213
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.243
of Anything Goes. said
it was too suggestive.

214
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.826
Sometimes I'd like to just tell them just

215
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.171
to shove it up their ass.

216
00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:42.959
But I'd like to keep my job.

217
00:16:42.983 --> 00:16:45.096
- I don't get it. Mama.

218
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.796
I can't make my whole life about you.

219
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.476
You did that and look where that got you.

220
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.933
You hate everyone. you never go out.

221
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.383
You might as well already be dead.

222
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.773
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

223
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.356
Okay. you're not pulling me down with you.

224
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.393
I won't allow it.

225
00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:10.063
If you wanna sit here.

226
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.236
(phone dinging)

227
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.260
If you wanna sit here and
waste away then go ahead.

228
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.313
but I'm not doing it.

229
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200
I wanna live.

230
00:17:26.115 --> 00:17:26.925
(phone beeping)

231
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:30.536
I wanna meet new people
and I wanna fall in love

232
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.943
and have my heart broken.

233
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.048
And learn new things.

234
00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:39.701
(loud chewing)

235
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.889
(sighs) And become a better person for it.

236
00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:44.163
(laughing)

237
00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:54.679
I'm not scared like you. Mama.

238
00:17:57.908 --> 00:17:58.718
(loud smacking)

239
00:17:58.742 --> 00:18:03.203
I know the world is capable
of beautiful things.

240
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.023
I know there's bad things too.

241
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.773
But if I stay here then I'll never know.

242
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.306
I'll never know what might have happened

243
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:20.183
if I had been more
courageous than you and left.

244
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.086
(clapping)

245
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.110
- Thank you. Hank.

246
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.730
- It's Henry.

247
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.903
- Right. we'll let you know
by the end of next week.

248
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.487
Here. I know these are expensive.

249
00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:40.453
(sighs)

250
00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:57.821
(suspenseful music)

251
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.156
- I am convinced the only way
to get a part in this town is

252
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.886
to blow someone. which I
don't have a problem doing

253
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.626
if someone would just tell me.

254
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.726
- So what is the big deal
about this place again?

255
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.126
- It's the only theater in the state

256
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.836
that gives you equity points so that you

257
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.516
can go on big auditions when
you get to New York or LA.

258
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.006
- Well. it makes sense I guess.

259
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.406
Ugh. I am so jealous of you right now.

260
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.106
I am ready to just have this baby

261
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.136
so I can start drinking again.

262
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.183
- Well. I'm sure one can't hurt.

263
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.066
Our mothers probably
drank every now and then

264
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.486
while they were pregnant.
- No.

265
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.476
No. no. no. I'm not gonna jinx this.

266
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.500
You know. my sister Rachel.
she is like a baby receptacle.

267
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.556
I mean. she just keeps
popping kids out of her body

268
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.376
one after another. and I
always think how amazing it is

269
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.876
that two people in the same bloodline

270
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.336
can have such different
reproductive systems.

271
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.426
I want this baby. I mean.
if I didn't want this baby

272
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.598
I wouldn't have tried for so long. (yawns)

273
00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:12.233
- (laughs) Wow. did you
get any sleep last night?

274
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.176
- Well. better than the night before

275
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.448
so I'm making progress.

276
00:20:18.472 --> 00:20:20.722
(laughing)

277
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.320
- Jess. do you ever have any

278
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.576
strange dreams?

279
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.176
- Oh yeah.

280
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.616
Ever since I got pregnant. my dreams.

281
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.566
I've just had doozies of 'em.

282
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.046
Like. okay. a week ago I dreamed
that I was in a three-way

283
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.365
with Kevin Spacey and
Dwight Yoakam. (laughs)

284
00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:48.066
And then two nights ago.

285
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.896
I dreamed that I was
a sorority girl. okay.

286
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.186
and the house mom was Cloris Leachman.

287
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.926
and she was a meth dealer.

288
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.176
It was too bad that that was a dream

289
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.713
because that would make
a great Netflix Original.

290
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.773
- I had a strange dream last night.

291
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.613
It was weird and it.

292
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.090
I've had the odd college exam
stress dream here and there.

293
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.393
But nothing like this.

294
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.059
You were in it.

295
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:27.576
(gasps)

296
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.683
- Was I skinny?

297
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.560
- You were pregnant.

298
00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:32.623
- Damn!

299
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.113
- Mr. Blakely and Ginny. they were there.

300
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:44.229
And that kid. the one that I sent

301
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.346
to the principle's office this morning.

302
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.370
- The creepy one?

303
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.623
- Yeah. Mitchell Mayer.

304
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.766
I can't. I can't remember
everything. I just.

305
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.853
I remember how it made me feel.

306
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.953
- Are you sure I wasn't skinny?

307
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.326
All right. speaking of that.

308
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.316
I better call the man that did this to me.

309
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.286
I didn't call him after my
appointment. he worries.

310
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.936
- Well. I should probably check on Ginny.

311
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.176
See how she's handling cafeteria duty.

312
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.356
- Oh. well. Mr. Blakely's
covering it for me and.

313
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.906
truth be known. I hope he suffers.

314
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.406
He still owes me a favor
for not telling his wife

315
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.506
about he and Mrs. Crawley's affair.

316
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.771
- (chuckles) The piano teacher?

317
00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:44.016
- Yes.

318
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.326
- Oh god.

319
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.066
- I'm gonna go make my call. you just.

320
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.960
I want you to think on that.
- Okay.

321
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.850
(sighs)

322
00:22:57.197 --> 00:23:00.264
(suspenseful music)

323
00:23:00.288 --> 00:23:02.955
(phone buzzing)

324
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.312
- Oh hey. honey. you're back.

325
00:23:07.336 --> 00:23:09.686
Caught me on a smoke brake. (chuckles)

326
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.627
- I thought you quit.

327
00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:13.086
- Yeah. well. I guess I have
a New Year's resolution then.

328
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.110
don't I?

329
00:23:15.298 --> 00:23:17.966
(distant popping)

330
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.850
- What was that?

331
00:23:18.874 --> 00:23:21.003
- I don't know. it sounded like fireworks.

332
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.489
- Ginny. I think you need to go.

333
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:24.323
(popping)
- What?

334
00:23:24.347 --> 00:23:27.433
- I think you need to get
in your car and leave now.

335
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.560
(gunshot blasting)
(blood spattering)

336
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:37.444
(gun blasting)

337
00:23:38.365 --> 00:23:40.032
- He is so horrible.

338
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.823
He worries so much and he's just so.

339
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.780
What is it?

340
00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:53.184
(suspenseful music)

341
00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:00.773
(whispers) What is it?

342
00:24:02.981 --> 00:24:05.814
(thrilling music)

343
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.186
- Shots rang out at a little
after 12:30 in the lunchroom

344
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.666
of Hamilton High just one week ago.

345
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.146
and we're still no closer
to finding out the motives

346
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.076
behind 17-year-old Mitchell
Mayer's killing spree

347
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.826
that left four teachers
and seven students dead.

348
00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.676
and over 10 injured.

349
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.246
Even more disturbing. Mayer's
parents. Angela and Michael.

350
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.996
were found brutally stabbed to death

351
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.626
in their Jackson home
later that afternoon.

352
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.846
The day before the shooting.

353
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.936
the teen posted a threatening
video on social media

354
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.566
that went ignored by most
students and teachers.

355
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.226
Warning. this video may be
disturbing for some viewers.

356
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.617
- I will take great pleasure
in slaughtering all of you.

357
00:25:08.643 --> 00:25:13.640
You will finally see that I
am not a mouse. but a god.

358
00:25:15.417 --> 00:25:18.686
- Police were notified by
two Hamilton High teachers.

359
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.776
Henry Lyle and Jessica Newton.

360
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.206
Neither were at the crime scene.

361
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.726
but were said to have been on the phone

362
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.576
with one of the victims at the time.

363
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.846
- I feel like all of this
could have been avoided

364
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.470
if someone would have spoken up.

365
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.846
Honestly. I just wanna
take all the guns away.

366
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.916
Just get rid of 'em all.

367
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.323
- Oh. Henry.

368
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.880
That's not gonna be good.

369
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.050
- Why?

370
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.733
- People like their guns around here.

371
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.070
- More than their children?

372
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.706
- I just don't think you needed

373
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.283
to make this political. is all.

374
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.446
- Kids died. Mom.
- Already there are

375
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.606
conspiracies that Henry and Jessica are...

376
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.936
- Some of my coworkers died.
- And that the entire thing

377
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960
was staged.

378
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.073
Local politician. Natalie
Jones. believe it's...

379
00:26:05.097 --> 00:26:07.636
- I'm sorry if I'm not
giving out cotillion-approved

380
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.660
talking points.

381
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.473
- [TV Reporter] And turned
him into a murderer.

382
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.795
- It looks like the reporters are gone.

383
00:26:22.819 --> 00:26:24.557
(blinds clattering)

384
00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:26.713
- (sighs) Are you okay. sweetie?

385
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.782
I think you need to get out of this house.

386
00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:31.806
- Are you kidding?

387
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.090
Most people would kill
for this much down time.

388
00:26:36.034 --> 00:26:38.951
(insects chirping)

389
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.513
- I'm gonna go wash this
cup out and go to bed.

390
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.412
- I'll do it.

391
00:26:49.436 --> 00:26:50.686
- Look. I can do it. you...

392
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.513
- No. you need some sleep.

393
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.913
Just go to bed. I'll take care of it.

394
00:27:15.406 --> 00:27:17.614
(phone buzzing)

395
00:27:17.638 --> 00:27:18.638
Hey.

396
00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:20.311
What's up?

397
00:27:21.177 --> 00:27:24.266
- [Jessica] Would you come
with me to this thing tomorrow?

398
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.646
- This thing?

399
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.846
That sounds sinister.

400
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.436
- It's in this kind of bad
area and I don't want James

401
00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.356
to know I'm going. it's
like a support group.

402
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.160
- I don't know. Jess. that...

403
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.897
That sounds goofy.

404
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:40.454
People just sitting around
talking about their feelings.

405
00:27:40.478 --> 00:27:41.288
(clears throat)

406
00:27:41.312 --> 00:27:42.936
- [Jessica] You don't have to participate.

407
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.293
I just want someone to go with me.

408
00:27:45.317 --> 00:27:47.317
(sighs)

409
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.270
Are you there?

410
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.779
- What time is it?

411
00:27:58.803 --> 00:27:59.803
- 7:30.

412
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.036
- [Henry] Goddammit.

413
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.146
- [Jessica] What?

414
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.776
- Not you.

415
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.176
Some reporter's trying to be sneaky.

416
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.750
- Okay.
- Can I call you back?

417
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.890
- Bye.
- All right.

418
00:28:23.261 --> 00:28:26.821
(knife clattering)

419
00:28:26.845 --> 00:28:29.762
(insects chirping)

420
00:28:51.786 --> 00:28:52.596
(hand slapping)
(gasping)

421
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.869
Jesus.
- Can I have a quote?

422
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.773
- Kiss my ass. end quote.

423
00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:05.356
(dramatic music)
(gasping)

424
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.536
- Did you remember to put
the cup in the dishwasher?

425
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.560
- Mom. go to bed.

426
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.242
- Remember to lock it
because if you don't lock it.

427
00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.366
- I know how it works.

428
00:29:18.286 --> 00:29:21.110
- Do you wanna come to
church with me next Sunday?

429
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.363
- Yeah. I'm sure that will really help.

430
00:29:29.466 --> 00:29:31.653
- There are a lot of
people there your age.

431
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.636
I don't know what I would have done

432
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.010
without my faith these
last few years I've had.

433
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.093
- I think I'll sleep in. Mom. thanks.

434
00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:44.594
- Okay.

435
00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:04.146
(door clattering)
(knife clanging)

436
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.553
- Where are you going?

437
00:30:05.577 --> 00:30:06.986
- To see a friend.

438
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.216
- Do I know them?

439
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.086
- No. I'm going to a play.

440
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.757
- Oh. which one?

441
00:30:11.781 --> 00:30:13.126
- [Henry] Mom. I feel like I'm on Jeopardy

442
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.902
with all the questions.

443
00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.776
- (laughs) I love you. sweetie.

444
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800
- I love you too.

445
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.316
Be back in a bit.

446
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.233
- Hey. if you known when. hey!
(bell dinging)

447
00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:29.257
(suspenseful music)

448
00:30:49.037 --> 00:30:51.787
(tires rumbling)

449
00:30:57.444 --> 00:31:00.444
(suspenseful music)

450
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.420
(engine revving)

451
00:31:18.369 --> 00:31:20.376
(suspenseful music)

452
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.623
- I've been having really terrible dreams.

453
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.806
Every time I shut my eyes.

454
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.630
I think I could have done something.

455
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.926
I think about Ginny.

456
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.950
and how she said that her husband
couldn't live without her.

457
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.623
And I think of him at Christmas. alone.

458
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.476
They rarely saw their daughter.

459
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.386
They only time they
ever saw her is when she

460
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.110
dropped her kid off to go
on some bender or something.

461
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.323
So he's there with no one.

462
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.866
And I think about the
kids and their families.

463
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.736
And I feel like I could
have done something.

464
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.436
I don't know what. but I
could have done something.

465
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.185
- Now. Jessica. you did
everything you could.

466
00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:11.253
and you too. Henry.

467
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.791
Now. I'm really glad you're with us today.

468
00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:16.515
Would you care to share something?

469
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.126
- (sighs) I'm so sorry I'm late everybody.

470
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.786
Someone OD'ed on the fourth
floor of the hotel again.

471
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.236
and so I had to wait
for the police to come.

472
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.926
and then by the time I got outta there

473
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.816
the interstate was backed up so I had

474
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.136
to suffer through that.

475
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.426
And then after all that
buildup it was just two people

476
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.216
on the side of the road with a flat tire.

477
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.106
I mean. I was really kinda
hoping for a decap or two.

478
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.266
- Jarvis!

479
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.755
What have I told you about interrupting

480
00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:47.986
other people's shares?

481
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.210
- You want some chicken?

482
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.336
How about you. you want some?

483
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.136
I mean. I'm not gonna eat
it all. I'm on a diet.

484
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.160
- Jarvis. you will remain silent
until it's your turn. okay?

485
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.463
- All right. now. now. go on Henry.

486
00:33:08.239 --> 00:33:12.072
- I'm not really comfortable
sharing just yet.

487
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.450
- So what was I interrupting?

488
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.356
- Henry. you can share whenever
you're up to it. all right?

489
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.438
Now. would anyone else care
to have a go at it. huh?

490
00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:25.295
What about you. Patty?

491
00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:29.835
- [Patty] I don't know
what to say exactly.

492
00:33:29.859 --> 00:33:32.859
(suspenseful music)

493
00:33:43.294 --> 00:33:44.104
- [Henry] I didn't know I was supposed

494
00:33:44.128 --> 00:33:45.459
to share at this thing.

495
00:33:45.483 --> 00:33:48.466
- I didn't know that he
was gonna ask you to share.

496
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.223
This. it was my first time.

497
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.766
- Jess. that's like
your sixth cup of coffee

498
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.731
since you've been here.

499
00:33:55.755 --> 00:33:58.716
- I didn't sleep good last night.

500
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.006
- It doesn't look like you're
gonna sleep well tonight.

501
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.173
(suspenseful music)

502
00:34:03.197 --> 00:34:08.197
What?

503
00:34:09.727 --> 00:34:10.667
What?

504
00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:11.890
What are you staring at?

505
00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:14.886
- It's nothing.

506
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.360
It's probably just I
haven't gotten enough sleep.

507
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:25.990
Have you seen strange
things since that day?

508
00:34:28.014 --> 00:34:29.014
- Define strange?

509
00:34:30.116 --> 00:34:34.866
- Well. you know like you're being watched

510
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:36.903
or maybe followed?

511
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.805
- Reporters?
- No. no. no.

512
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:41.966
It's not them.

513
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:45.306
It's like when I'm
walking in a parking lot

514
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.188
there's someone walking
like right behind me.

515
00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:52.066
And then when I go outside in the morning

516
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.113
to get the paper. they're watching me.

517
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:58.373
They're always staring at me.

518
00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:05.016
I knew. I knew you
would think I was crazy.

519
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.290
- No. hey. I don't think
you're crazy at all.

520
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.686
Maybe you just need some sleep.

521
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.806
- Yeah.

522
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:12.830
- Maybe a vacation.

523
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.906
- A vacation wouldn't do any good

524
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.130
because then I would
have to come back here.

525
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.393
Because you can't outrun your demons.

526
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.486
And I have a feeling the worst part of it

527
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.533
hasn't even started.

528
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:35.091
(suspenseful music)

529
00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:39.060
- You gonna be okay?

530
00:35:40.823 --> 00:35:43.631
All right. you call me if you need me.

531
00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:46.572
(insects chirping)

532
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.876
- Hi.

533
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.083
I'm Jarvis Coker.

534
00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:03.586
- Oh yeah. I noticed.

535
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.236
- Look. I'm sorry about
sabotaging your share back there.

536
00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.477
but I tend to do that.
I've gotta stop doing that.

537
00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:10.983
You know. it's not all
about you. Jarvis. (laughs)

538
00:36:11.007 --> 00:36:11.817
- Hey. don't worry about it.

539
00:36:11.841 --> 00:36:13.466
I really didn't have
anything to share anyway.

540
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.416
- Oh thank god. a normal one.

541
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.606
I swear. it's like most of the people here

542
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.163
are absolute looney tunes.

543
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.716
Oh not you. no. no.

544
00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.616
Not you. no. you're great. you're great.

545
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.706
She's the worst one. she's horrible.

546
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.466
I feel like I've seen you before.

547
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.636
- From the news?

548
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.366
- Oh hell no. I don't watch the news.

549
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.227
Way too depressing.

550
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:38.126
I think we should try to
keep things light. don't you?

551
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.047
- Yeah.

552
00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:40.920
- You audition at Center Stage right?

553
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.196
- Yeah. all the good it does me.

554
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.351
- Oh my god. right?

555
00:36:46.375 --> 00:36:47.603
It's like the whole thing's rigged.

556
00:36:47.627 --> 00:36:51.176
I's like. look. the sets look
great. the costumes are great.

557
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.700
but they cast the exact
same people in everything.

558
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.523
- They told me you had a vision.

559
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.213
They said that you knew what could happen.

560
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.096
That you saw it before it happened.

561
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.713
And you didn't tell anybody!

562
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.963
You killed those kids!

563
00:37:18.523 --> 00:37:21.678
You should have reported that boy.

564
00:37:21.702 --> 00:37:25.910
My granddaughter had
two bullets in her head

565
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.967
because of you!

566
00:37:29.488 --> 00:37:31.155
It's all your fault.

567
00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:36.460
I would kill you right now

568
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.283
for what you did to those kids!

569
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.193
But you are not worth it.

570
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.893
Justice will be paid eventually.

571
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:56.890
Oh. there are many forms
of justice in this world.

572
00:38:02.162 --> 00:38:03.162
- Whoa.

573
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760
Oh my god.

574
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.180
Are you okay?

575
00:38:11.438 --> 00:38:12.438
- Yeah.

576
00:38:14.552 --> 00:38:15.552
- Wow.

577
00:38:16.451 --> 00:38:18.226
I can't believe I almost
died in a church parking lot

578
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.292
that's right down the
street from a City Trends.

579
00:38:21.316 --> 00:38:23.566
(chuckles)

580
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.660
Do you want a drink?

581
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.237
They all talk the same. you
know. they all have that same

582
00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:31.543
weird way of talking.

583
00:38:31.567 --> 00:38:34.543
"Oh. I am so happy to audition for you."

584
00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:37.186
"I am so grateful for this opportunity."

585
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.456
And they all sing. like
they all sing like this.

586
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.447
like way up here.

587
00:38:40.471 --> 00:38:45.470
And all the guys have that
weird like rock nasal tenor crap

588
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.846
where they're all like this.

589
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.246
It's like ugh. just makes
we want to claw my ears out

590
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.296
and just throw them at them.

591
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.129
Waiter!

592
00:38:52.153 --> 00:38:53.036
Hi. can I have more?

593
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.060
Thanks.

594
00:38:54.855 --> 00:38:56.450
Ridiculous.

595
00:38:56.474 --> 00:38:58.474
(sighs)

596
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.367
- Well. I wish I could
sing. even a little bit.

597
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.293
My dad could so.

598
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.666
- Could?

599
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.499
- Yeah.

600
00:39:09.523 --> 00:39:10.523
- What. is he dead?

601
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.773
- Alzheimer's. early onset.

602
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.586
- Ooh. I'm sorry.

603
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.456
- Yeah. that's okay. I get that a lot.

604
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.843
He was in a band in the '80s.

605
00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:27.623
He was good too. they
even put out a record.

606
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:34.270
But then he got married.
had a kid. a normal job.

607
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.976
All that crap.

608
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.406
He used to tell me he wanted
to be a music teacher.

609
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:45.430
but it just didn't pay enough.
not for my mom at least.

610
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.460
She had an image and
a lifestyle to uphold.

611
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.530
but I think that if my dad
had had a reason to live

612
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:05.130
he might would have. he
might would still be here.

613
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.346
He might would have gotten sick still.

614
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.370
but he would have had a reason to fight.

615
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.483
- So you and your mom
weren't worth fighting for?

616
00:40:19.299 --> 00:40:20.299
- Is that enough?

617
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.426
You know. for an artist.

618
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.856
At least. if you're not
able to do your art.

619
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.962
you might as well be dead.

620
00:40:29.986 --> 00:40:31.986
- Ugh. (chuckles)

621
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:37.010
- But you. I mean. you've
gotten out. done things.

622
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.336
I've just mostly done
bad community theater.

623
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.246
- I mean. after I was
kicked out of college.

624
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.126
I went straight to New York.

625
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.846
I did a few
Off-Off-Off-Off-Off-Broadway shows.

626
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.406
and then I landed the highly coveted gig

627
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.516
of SpongeBob Number Three at the

628
00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.937
Nickelodeon Theme Park Hotel.

629
00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:58.236
(laughs)

630
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.910
- I didn't know they had a hotel.

631
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.306
- They don't. they don't.
it closed. (laughs)

632
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.330
Waiter!

633
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.963
- You know. I feel like
I am wasting my time.

634
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.163
I'm never gonna get outta here.

635
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.246
And I'm just gonna end up like
these other mindless zombies

636
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:23.623
who just go through the motions.

637
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.696
- Well. I have ways of
finding out. you know.

638
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.026
- Are you psychic?

639
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.686
- Okay.

640
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.633
I learned how to read palms.

641
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.626
It's a long story.

642
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.246
I was living out of a van
when I was 23 with this guy.

643
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.376
He was addicted to crystal meth.

644
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.566
He still had all of his teeth though.

645
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.466
which was a nice touch.

646
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.426
- I don't really believe in all of that.

647
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.806
- Okay. so you're the
one with the visions.

648
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.330
and you don't believe in this?

649
00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.943
Okay. give me your hand.

650
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:55.426
Let me prove myself.

651
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:58.073
Hey. that eye roll was
completely uncalled for.

652
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.603
Let's see here.

653
00:42:01.456 --> 00:42:02.456
Ooh. okay.

654
00:42:06.432 --> 00:42:07.538
- What?

655
00:42:07.562 --> 00:42:08.895
What do you see?

656
00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:10.894
What?

657
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.380
What. am I not gonna get married?

658
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.966
Have two and a half kids?

659
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.576
What?

660
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.959
(suspenseful music)

661
00:42:18.983 --> 00:42:20.193
Am I dying tomorrow?

662
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.210
- According to this...

663
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.870
You should already be dead.

664
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:38.496
- Look. I gotta go.

665
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.236
- I didn't mean to scare you.

666
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.923
- It's fine. it's good to meet you.

667
00:42:41.947 --> 00:42:43.820
but I really do have to go.

668
00:42:49.211 --> 00:42:52.333
(lights buzzing)

669
00:42:52.357 --> 00:42:57.357
(door slamming)
(insects chirping)

670
00:43:08.744 --> 00:43:11.661
(distant slamming)

671
00:43:20.908 --> 00:43:21.718
(dramatic music)

672
00:43:21.742 --> 00:43:23.741
(gasps)

673
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.680
Can I help you?

674
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.410
Excuse me. I.

675
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.113
Excuse me. I need to get in.

676
00:43:41.542 --> 00:43:44.375
(thrilling music)

677
00:44:01.313 --> 00:44:03.563
(clicking)

678
00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:20.944
(clicking)

679
00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:32.290
(thrilling music)

680
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.663
(thrilling music)

681
00:45:22.785 --> 00:45:25.035
(clicking)

682
00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:33.244
(clicking)

683
00:45:37.338 --> 00:45:40.171
(thrilling music)

684
00:45:51.233 --> 00:45:53.334
(clicking)

685
00:45:53.358 --> 00:45:55.525
(ringing)

686
00:45:57.908 --> 00:46:00.158
(clicking)

687
00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:12.636
(doors clattering)

688
00:46:14.385 --> 00:46:17.302
(elevator beeping)

689
00:46:25.757 --> 00:46:28.674
(doors clattering)

690
00:46:31.604 --> 00:46:34.521
(insects chirping)

691
00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.696
(dramatic music)

692
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.586
- I know you're an actor and everything.

693
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.609
but are you prone to dramatic exits?

694
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.233
Here. you left this. (laughs)

695
00:46:57.676 --> 00:46:58.976
You know. if I wasn't such a decent person

696
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.116
I would've kept it for myself.
but then I got to thinking

697
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.266
how me might end up in the
same meeting at some point.

698
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.100
you might see me wearing it.

699
00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:06.776
and that'd just be tacky. (laughs)

700
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.929
About. you know.

701
00:47:07.953 --> 00:47:09.743
I didn't mean to scare you.

702
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.586
It's a party trick. nothing more.

703
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.610
- It's fine.

704
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.486
- Look. I know how hard it is
to admit that there's a issue.

705
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.406
but you've taken that first step.

706
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:23.830
and that takes a lotta guts.

707
00:47:24.887 --> 00:47:25.787
(laughs)

708
00:47:25.811 --> 00:47:29.076
- Okay. look. I'm really fine.

709
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.376
I don't have a problem.

710
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.036
Okay. I was just there
for Jessica. that's it.

711
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.949
- Okay. okay. if you say so but just know

712
00:47:35.973 --> 00:47:38.336
that if you ever need to talk to anyone

713
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.976
I'm open day or night.
but if you could keep it

714
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.913
between the hours of noon
and 6PM that would be great.

715
00:47:43.937 --> 00:47:47.906
I programmed my number
into your phone under BFF

716
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.636
while you were in the bathroom.

717
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.926
You should really like lock your phone.

718
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.650
There's so many crazies out there.

719
00:47:54.133 --> 00:47:55.973
So where you parked. where you parked?

720
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.697
- I'm over there.

721
00:47:57.721 --> 00:47:59.957
- Oh. me too. I'll walk you to your car.

722
00:48:09.596 --> 00:48:12.179
(somber music)

723
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:44.570
(curtain clattering)

724
00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:47.344
(vacuum humming)

725
00:48:50.254 --> 00:48:55.254
(water splashing)
(vacuum humming)

726
00:49:05.514 --> 00:49:08.421
(water splashing)

727
00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:11.195
(vacuum humming)

728
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:15.384
(water splashing)

729
00:49:17.149 --> 00:49:20.149
(suspenseful music)

730
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.813
(water splashing)

731
00:49:42.927 --> 00:49:43.927
- Ma?

732
00:49:48.082 --> 00:49:49.606
What are you doing?

733
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.430
- Were you gonna tell me about this?

734
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.670
- Why were you going through my things?

735
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.660
- Have you been selling drugs?

736
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.690
- I was doing this so I could...

737
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.430
Move away.

738
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.946
And have a year or two taken care of.

739
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:10.920
- With everything that's happened here?

740
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.566
My car. the leak in the attic. the...

741
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.586
- Well. maybe if you
didn't keep buying bullshit

742
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.566
like new chairs and curtains
for our non-existent guests

743
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.146
this wouldn't be an issue.

744
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.646
- Henry. there's nothing wrong with me

745
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.996
wanting this house to look nice.

746
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.970
I may end up selling one of these days.

747
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.156
- It's my money. okay?

748
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.876
I will take care of the loans when I can.

749
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.656
- I guess you just want this
to keep earning interest

750
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.736
while you dally off to New York
and get your dreams quashed.

751
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.986
- Hey. well the sooner I head out there.

752
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.521
the sooner I can come back
with my tale between my legs

753
00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:49.766
and take care of you
in your twilight years.

754
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.526
I mean. that's all you
care about. isn't it?

755
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.750
It's all about who's
gonna take care of you?

756
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.700
Because you can't stand
the thought of being alone.

757
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:06.770
I will take care of you
when the times comes.

758
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.400
but it hasn't. and before it
does I have to live my life.

759
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.536
You're not even that old.

760
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.896
Why are you making this
seem like such a bad thing?

761
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.033
- Because. Henry. it is a bad thing.

762
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.630
You think I haven't seen how
this world treats the elderly?

763
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.533
Henry. I'm scared.

764
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.406
I'm not gonna end up a vegetable
in one of those nursing

765
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.583
homes like that one where your Maw Maw is.

766
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.120
Like the one they sent your daddy to.

767
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.646
I need to know that I'm
gonna be taken care of

768
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:50.773
in my old age.

769
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.150
And I think...

770
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.866
I think it's the least
goddamn thing I deserve

771
00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:02.833
after taking care of raising you.

772
00:52:05.692 --> 00:52:07.192
- Was I that much of a burden?

773
00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.919
- No.

774
00:52:09.943 --> 00:52:12.336
Oh Henry. that's not what I meant.

775
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.853
- It's never what you mean.

776
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:18.936
Dad believed in me.

777
00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.386
- I believe in you.

778
00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.610
- [Henry] No. you don't.

779
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.386
- I just wanna know that
you're gonna be safe.

780
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:28.136
It's a tough business. Henry.

781
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.660
- You don't think I know that?

782
00:52:31.566 --> 00:52:34.366
You don't think I think about
that every day of my life?

783
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:41.740
God. if I could do anything
else I would. but this is it.

784
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.686
- I think your daddy would have wanted you

785
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.746
to stay here and pay
off those student loans.

786
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:53.953
- Sometimes you just have to take a risk.

787
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.706
I mean. Dad could have stayed in the band.

788
00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:58.956
He could have been a star.

789
00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.980
- Henry.

790
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:01.886
No.

791
00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.163
No. he was never gonna be a star.

792
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.543
He wasn't that good.

793
00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:14.090
Neither are you.

794
00:53:20.758 --> 00:53:21.758
- Oh.

795
00:53:28.984 --> 00:53:29.984
There it is.

796
00:53:32.136 --> 00:53:33.136
- No.

797
00:53:34.584 --> 00:53:36.144
Oh. Henry!

798
00:53:36.168 --> 00:53:37.168
Henry!

799
00:53:39.592 --> 00:53:42.836
(whispers) Oh my god.

800
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.116
Oh!

801
00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.096
- I just came for my
friend who didn't tell me

802
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.573
she wasn't going to be here.

803
00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:53.583
She's been taking everything
really hard since the.

804
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.470
well. you know.

805
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.170
I think she worries about me

806
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.590
because I haven't really
felt much since the shooting.

807
00:54:08.517 --> 00:54:13.517
I don't cry or talk about it much.

808
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.793
- Now. there's nothing wrong with crying.

809
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:30.853
- I've always had a bit
of a nervous disposition.

810
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.960
Still I venture to say that
I am probably the sanest.

811
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.253
most sensible person that I know.

812
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:48.150
I never did drugs or got
drunk every night or had sex.

813
00:54:48.929 --> 00:54:52.136
(chuckles) I just never
really had much interest

814
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.346
in all of it. to be honest.

815
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:58.343
I mean. all of my classmates
did. but I didn't.

816
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.190
The point is that I'm
weird. but I'm not crazy.

817
00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:14.580
And Jessica. she doesn't strike
me as the crazy type either.

818
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:17.370
But...

819
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.826
But there's been this something in the air

820
00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:25.586
since the shooting.

821
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.173
I've tried to shrug it off.

822
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:34.170
but it just follows me
everywhere that I go. (chuckles)

823
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:40.083
I used to have this
dream when I was a kid.

824
00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.880
And even well into my 20s where...

825
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.876
Where I'd killed someone. (chuckles)

826
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.973
For good reason. it was
self-defense or something.

827
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:03.953
And I buried the body.
and I got away with it.

828
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.803
But then. years later.
the ground was dug up

829
00:56:08.827 --> 00:56:10.353
and the body was found.

830
00:56:13.022 --> 00:56:18.022
And I'm terrified that
I'm gonna get caught.

831
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.826
Then I wake up and 10
minutes after I would

832
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:32.643
feel like someone was out
to get me for what I did.

833
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:40.860
That's how I feel now.
like someone or something

834
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:44.683
is out to get me.

835
00:56:55.523 --> 00:56:58.310
(phone ringing)

836
00:56:58.334 --> 00:57:01.643
(Jessica screaming)
(phone buzzing)

837
00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:02.766
- [Jessica Recording] Hi. this is Jessica.

838
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.456
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.

839
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.342
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

840
00:57:07.366 --> 00:57:08.325
(sighs)

841
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:12.681
(tapping)
(gasping)

842
00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:17.506
- You know. you don't have
to call me. I'm right here.

843
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.146
- Yeah.

844
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.087
I didn't call.

845
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:21.606
- Yeah. I mean. I'm not gonna lie.

846
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.236
My feelings were a little hurt for a bit.

847
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.566
but I know you wanna be my best friend

848
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:28.116
and make it up to me so
what are you doing tonight?

849
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.226
- Well. I was actually just
calling to check on Jessica

850
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:34.306
because I haven't seen or
heard from her in a few days.

851
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.006
- Okay. well you can
do that and everything.

852
00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.906
but how do you feel about maybe

853
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.656
coming over to my place and
having something to eat?

854
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.513
It's my birthday. my fiance's
cooking. he's really good.

855
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:50.396
Oh. come on. unbutton your top button.

856
00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.076
You know. throw your shoes off.

857
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.943
Paint the town red. whatever that means.

858
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.306
- Okay. look. I haven't eaten so I can

859
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.696
come over for a little bit.

860
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.420
- Okay. perfect. perfect. I
will text you the address.

861
00:58:06.853 --> 00:58:09.853
(suspenseful music)

862
00:58:12.421 --> 00:58:15.588
(seat-belt clattering)

863
00:58:16.904 --> 00:58:21.904
(engine revving)
(car beeping)

864
00:58:26.138 --> 00:58:29.138
(suspenseful music)

865
00:58:38.834 --> 00:58:41.084
(clicking)

866
00:58:54.445 --> 00:58:56.695
(clicking)

867
00:59:01.493 --> 00:59:03.743
(knocking)

868
00:59:14.457 --> 00:59:16.368
(bell dinging)

869
00:59:16.392 --> 00:59:17.392
- Hello.

870
00:59:19.012 --> 00:59:21.046
(suspenseful music)

871
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.783
Are you selling something?

872
00:59:33.546 --> 00:59:34.356
(gasping)

873
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.053
(gun blasting)

874
00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:38.996
- So you just punched the kid in his face.

875
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.986
- Right in his face. right
in his fat little face.

876
00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:44.336
I had had it up to here. I
mean. it was so hot that day.

877
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.446
and I was like full SpongeBob regalia

878
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:47.876
so it was like super. super hot.

879
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.616
And this kid keeps putting
this stick in my face

880
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.756
so I just shove it.

881
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.486
And it was so satisfying. and
then I got fired the next day.

882
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.026
But it was totally worth
it. absolutely worth it.

883
00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.466
- Oh. Wells. let me help you.

884
01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.386
You cooked. it's the least I could do.

885
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.016
- No. no. really it's fine. I got it.

886
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.986
- Look. never volunteer to help him.

887
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:07.786
He's got his own dish washing system.

888
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.286
You're never gonna get it right.

889
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.147
- Are you done?

890
01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:13.546
- Well. I'm fat. Wells. so
that's all I'm gonna eat.

891
01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.186
- You're not fat.

892
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.016
- I know I'm not like 1000 pounds.

893
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.356
but there are different
kinds of fat. Wells.

894
01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.373
- Well. then you're an imaginary fat.

895
01:00:21.397 --> 01:00:23.416
- Oh. that's sweet. that's so sweet.

896
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.346
That would very sweet
if I wasn't convinced

897
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.186
you're trying to keep me fat so

898
01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.546
that no one else will
want me. it's so sweet.

899
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.177
He wants me all to himself.

900
01:00:31.201 --> 01:00:32.011
- [Wells] Hey. sweetie?

901
01:00:32.035 --> 01:00:34.835
You mind if I take a few of
these to the guys at the morgue?

902
01:00:34.859 --> 01:00:35.787
We have so much left over.

903
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:38.516
I figure I might take some in.
you know. cheer 'em up a bit.

904
01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.526
- Sure.

905
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:43.056
I mean. you do all the cooking
so I'm not gonna need 'em.

906
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.583
- So. what happened?

907
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.286
- [Wells] Well. actually
do you wanna tell 'em?

908
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.566
I'm scared I might be late.

909
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:49.590
- Sure. sure.

910
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:54.926
Well. you see. a few weeks ago or.

911
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.246
How long ago was it again. babe?

912
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.080
- [Wells] Three weeks.

913
01:00:58.104 --> 01:01:01.356
- Okay. so three weeks ago
his friends at the morgue

914
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.456
started to notice the bodies
were just disappearing.

915
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.996
Believe it or not. stuff like
that has happened before.

916
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.193
Like college pranks and stuff.

917
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.086
- I can't believe people still do that.

918
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.346
- I know. it's totally gross. right?

919
01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:19.656
But this was different 'cause
they would take the bodies.

920
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.683
but then they would bring them back.

921
01:01:22.918 --> 01:01:25.056
- I had a guy tell me just
the other day one came in.

922
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080
A nun.

923
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:28.667
- A nun?

924
01:01:28.691 --> 01:01:31.416
- Yeah. she was still in
her habit and everything.

925
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.006
Died from some freak
aneurysm or something.

926
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.507
- So where did they find the body?

927
01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:39.931
- It was somewhere downtown
in a parking garage.

928
01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.050
- Are you all right?

929
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:50.983
- No. sorry. I was just
thinking about something.

930
01:01:52.912 --> 01:01:54.816
- Well. anyway. the guys in security

931
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.546
have been in a pretty bad
mood ever since this started.

932
01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.786
Probably scared they're gonna get fired.

933
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:02.376
Because. see. the thing is
we watch the security tapes.

934
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.286
And we can't find anything fishy.

935
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.766
I mean. the camera might
malfunction every once in a while

936
01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:08.393
and cut off. but that's it.

937
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:12.726
- Well. that would be something
fishy. Wells. (chuckles)

938
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.646
- All right. well what
I mean is. smart-ass.

939
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.570
is that we can't se any vandals
or anything. that's weird.

940
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:20.806
It just goes to show whoever's doing this

941
01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:22.540
knows what they're doing.

942
01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:39.819
(phone buzzing)

943
01:02:43.738 --> 01:02:46.438
- Yes?
- Henry. you have to help me.

944
01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:49.040
I've done something and. oh god.

945
01:02:51.175 --> 01:02:52.916
You have to help me.

946
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.288
He wasn't himself. please. he...

947
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.456
- Jess. what's wrong?
- You have to get here before.

948
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.543
I don't know what I've just done. I.

949
01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.710
Oh god!

950
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:05.038
(motor humming)

951
01:03:10.181 --> 01:03:13.098
(insects chirping)

952
01:03:15.315 --> 01:03:17.565
(knocking)

953
01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:31.099
(suspenseful music)

954
01:04:07.079 --> 01:04:09.329
(knocking)

955
01:04:14.636 --> 01:04:17.652
(knocking)

956
01:04:17.676 --> 01:04:19.759
(groans)

957
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.896
(dramatic music)

958
01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.887
- What?

959
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.386
What is goin' on?

960
01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:38.076
- Listen. I've done
something really crazy.

961
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.010
but you have to understand
that I did it in self-defense.

962
01:04:43.727 --> 01:04:44.783
- What did you do?

963
01:04:51.848 --> 01:04:54.098
(exhaling)

964
01:05:04.078 --> 01:05:05.304
(gagging)

965
01:05:05.328 --> 01:05:07.946
- No. no. no. Henry.
- Don't touch me!

966
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.926
- Look. I know this is
crazy. but it wasn't James.

967
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.126
- What have you done?

968
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:14.716
- He left to go get cigarettes.

969
01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.106
and then when he came
back he. he. oh god...

970
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.261
- Jesus.

971
01:05:19.285 --> 01:05:23.266
- I don't know who that
is. but it's not James.

972
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.496
It's not James.

973
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.780
It was his eyes. his eyes. they. they...

974
01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:30.256
They didn't look normal.

975
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.746
Okay. it was really weird.

976
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:35.023
He looked just like those
people that I've been seeing.

977
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:38.090
- What people?

978
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.606
- Henry. Henry. you know.
you know. the people.

979
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:47.376
You know. the people because
you've been seeing them too.

980
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.706
And they've been following you.

981
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:51.656
- Jessica. we need to call the police.

982
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.806
- What are the police gonna do?

983
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:55.836
What are they gonna do?

984
01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.827
They're gonna get them too.

985
01:05:56.851 --> 01:05:59.470
They're gonna get anyone
that stands in their way.

986
01:05:59.494 --> 01:06:01.706
- Jessica.
- Please. please.

987
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.293
Please. you have to listen to me. okay?

988
01:06:03.317 --> 01:06:06.817
We just have to get out of here right now!

989
01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:11.458
(thrilling music)

990
01:06:13.047 --> 01:06:15.047
I have to get my jacket.

991
01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:32.070

995
01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:10.771
Henry!

996
01:07:12.174 --> 01:07:14.257
James's body isn't there!

997
01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:19.220
- What do you mean. he's not there?

998
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.790
- I mean his body isn't
there. we have to leave!

999
01:07:21.814 --> 01:07:22.904
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

1000
01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:25.908

1003
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.047
- James.

1004
01:07:37.071 --> 01:07:39.904
(thrilling music)

1005
01:07:42.399 --> 01:07:45.266
(knife clanging)

1006
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:47.113
James. stop!

1007
01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:50.646
I don't wanna do this!

1008
01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:57.736

Yes.

1013
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:56.193
My name is Henry Lyle.

1014
01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:03.053
I'm at 1845 Hill Street.

1015
01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.463
I need to report a murder.

1016
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.073
It's not my house. it's a friend's.

1017
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.403
She stabbed her husband to death.

1018
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:23.643
And then he snapped her neck.

1019
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:32.561
Yeah.

1020
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.597

Mom.

1038
01:14:49.932 --> 01:14:51.099
We have to go.

1039
01:14:56.175 --> 01:14:57.175
Mom.

What's going on?

1063
01:17:37.518 --> 01:17:40.185
(phone buzzing)

1064
01:17:43.572 --> 01:17:46.572
(suspenseful music)

1065
01:17:49.153 --> 01:17:50.576
- Hello?

1066
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.256
- Wells. can you come home?

1067
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.426
- Come home why?

1068
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:56.416
- Henry. just came to the house.
and he's drenched in blood

1069
01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.566
and mumbling something
about his friend Jessica

1070
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:00.400
and her husband.

1071
01:18:00.424 --> 01:18:01.846
I think there might have
been some kind of a fight.

1072
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:04.566
I really don't know. but I'm
kinda freaking out right now.

1073
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:07.446
And he just says that
he really wants you here

1074
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:10.273
so if you can just get in the car. please.

1075
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:13.730
- You and your damn strays from group.

1076
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.426
If this one attempts
suicide like the last one.

1077
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:20.416
- Wells. just get in the
car and come back home!

1078
01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.806
Please. do this for me.

1079
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:25.636
- [Wells] Fine. just hide the pills

1080
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.763
and knives until I get there.

1081
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:30.676
- Thank you. sweetie.

1082
01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700
I love you.

1083
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200
These should fit.

1084
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.910
The bathroom's right across the hall.

1085
01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.963
Do you need something.
like a Xanax or something?

1086
01:19:09.824 --> 01:19:10.926
(suspenseful music)

1087
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:11.784
- That's her.

1088
01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:13.883
That's the lady that attacked me tonight.

1089
01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.386
- Is that the woman from the parking lot?

1090
01:19:17.410 --> 01:19:18.410
- Yeah.

1091
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.896
- Well. Henry. it says that she's dead.

1092
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.443
- No. that's her. I saw her.

1093
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.376
- Henry. that sounds insane.

1094
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.803
- I know it sounds crazy.

1095
01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.440
Earlier tonight. I would have
been right there with you.

1096
01:19:37.793 --> 01:19:40.430
And Jessica. she tried to warn me.

1097
01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:45.663
But it didn't make any sense!

1098
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.720
The dream.

1099
01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:53.253
The dream. it was a warning.

1100
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:56.793
I don't know why it
came to me. but it did.

1101
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:04.430
I know what's happening now.

1102
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:09.076
I wasn't supposed to
survive that massacre.

1103
01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.803
I was supposed to be there.

1104
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:14.993
We were supposed to be there!

1105
01:20:18.133 --> 01:20:20.800
We weren't supposed to be saved.

1106
01:20:24.522 --> 01:20:25.477
- Henry.

1107
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:27.773
- I know it sounds crazy!

1108
01:20:29.563 --> 01:20:30.896
Maybe I'm crazy.

1109
01:20:32.626 --> 01:20:34.987
Maybe I'm outta my mind.

1110
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:36.926
I have to prepare myself that I might just

1111
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:38.193
be out of my mind!

1112
01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:43.560
That's the most rational
explanation. isn't it?

1113
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:48.856
But what if I'm not?

1114
01:20:53.122 --> 01:20:54.955
What if I'm not crazy?

1115
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.880
- I called Wells. he's on his way.

1116
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120
I'm gonna...

1117
01:21:08.503 --> 01:21:09.827
I'm gonna go wait for him.

1118
01:21:17.435 --> 01:21:18.933
(suspenseful music)

1119
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.790

1124
01:22:14.214 --> 01:22:17.468
(dramatic music)

1125
01:22:17.492 --> 01:22:19.659
Wells. what are you doing?

1126
01:22:28.219 --> 01:22:31.360
(dramatic music)

1127
01:22:31.384 --> 01:22:34.217

1128
01:22:35.143 --> 01:22:37.976

1129
01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:46.693
(suspenseful music)

1130
01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:06.542
- Is Wells here yet?

1131
01:23:13.653 --> 01:23:14.653
Jarvis.

1132
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.040
(suspenseful music)

1133
01:23:34.796 --> 01:23:37.046

Shit!

1153
01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:50.126
- Are you all right?

1154
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:50.959
- Whoa!

1155
01:26:50.983 --> 01:26:51.983
- Don't touch me!

1156
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:55.221
- Do I need to call the police?

1157
01:26:55.245 --> 01:26:56.328
- No. please.

1158
01:26:57.739 --> 01:26:59.083
It doesn't matter!

1159
01:26:59.107 --> 01:27:01.523
They're gonna find me anywhere I go!

- I don't have my wallet!

1164

1168

get gas without paying.

1169
01:27:25.102 --> 01:27:26.102
