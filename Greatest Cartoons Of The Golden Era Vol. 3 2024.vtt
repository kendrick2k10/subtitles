Hi. I'm Charles Dewandeler

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.520
and today we're watching
a cartoon compilation

12
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.606
featuring characters who
travel to new worlds.

13
00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:33.120
If you love traveling

14
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.340
then this compilation is for you.

15
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.360
We'll kick things off

16
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.140
with one of our favorite
animated characters. Bugs Bunny.

17
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.700
Most of the time when we see Bugs.

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.100
he's in his natural habitat. the forest.

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.600
However. in this cartoon.

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
Bugs travels to the far
away land of the desert

21
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.840
to prank his rival. Elmer Fudd.

22
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.640
Why is Elmer Fudd in the desert?

23
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.650
Because he's searching for gold.

24
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.547

Fudd in "Wacky Wabbit."

Oh yeah.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.290
Thank you very much.

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:07.488

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.070
Well. I got one of them.

77
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:28.389

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:45.468
I have a wittle surprise for you.

80
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.080
Don't laugh.

81
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.843

men wear one of these.

82
00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:08.653

Wabbit. I came here for
gold and I'm going to get it!

94
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.534
No. no. no.

95
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.288
Not that. Not that.

96
00:07:19.288 --> 00:07:21.273
Anything but that.

97
00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:25.290

98
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:29.088

Eureka! Gold at wast.

100
00:07:37.413 --> 00:07:41.869
Eureka! Gold at wast.

101
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.490
In our next cartoon.

102
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.190
Superman travels to an underground world

103
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.070
where he battles a race of hawk men.

104
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.650
Can Superman save Lois in time?

105
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.760
Or will she be turned into
a permanent gold statue?

106
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.687
Here is Superman in
"The Underground World."

107
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.610
And while on a hunting trip.

108
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.990
my father discovered

109
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.750
what are now known as
the Henderson Caverns.

110
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.160
More than 40 years ago.

111
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.403
he mysteriously disappeared
while exploring them further.

112
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.060
Recently. I found these
maps and charts he left

113
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.010
suggesting there're still greater wonders

114
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.420
and mysteries laid beyond in
this vast underground world.

115
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.090
Now. if your paper will
help finance the expedition.

116
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.850
I will take Ms. Lane and Mr. Kent with me

117
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.650
and guarantee the Daily Planet

118
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.050
exclusive rights to the story.

119
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.790
Sounds like a great story. Chief.

120
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.770
I'd love to go.

121
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.560
Well. let me see.

122
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.330
Alright. It's a deal.

123
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.380
Thanks Mr. White.

124
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.414
We can leave immediately.

125
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.040
Careful now.

126
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.790
Those are explosives for the
blasting we'll have to do.

127
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.230
We're shoving off. Kent.

128
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.823
Meet you in the Blue Grotto.

129
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.671
- So long. Clark.
- See you later. Lois.

130
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.804
It's beautiful.

131
00:09:50.783 --> 00:09:51.874
According to the map.

132
00:09:51.874 --> 00:09:55.806
this next grotto is further
than any man has ever been.

133
00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:59.848
- Is that to be our society?
- That's right.

134
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:23.138
The boat!

135
00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:52.338
The dynamite!

136
00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:18.809
Lois!

137
00:11:38.987 --> 00:11:40.733
Look at the statute above his head.

138
00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:48.664
Why. the resemblance is remarkable.

139
00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:52.470
- Is that-
- Yes. my father.

140
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.143
But what would they be
doing with a statue of him?

141
00:11:56.929 --> 00:12:00.725
Anderson?

142
00:12:05.927 --> 00:12:10.927
Lois?

143
00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:33.980
Anderson?

144
00:12:37.344 --> 00:12:38.177
Lois?

145
00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:13.551
Oh no!

146
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.816
This is a job for Superman.

147
00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:40.683
It's really
a great story. Lois.

148
00:14:43.497 --> 00:14:45.423
but no one would ever believe it.

149
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.660
Our next cartoon stars Daffy Duck.

150
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.520
The man who performs
the voice of Daffy Duck

151
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.590
and most of the other
characters in this cartoon

152
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.890
is the legendary man of a
thousand voices. Mel Blanc.

153
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.190
In this cartoon. Porky Pig
is a producer in Hollywood

154
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.160
who just wants to leave work
so he can go on vacation.

155
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.880
But Daffy Duck. a talent
agent. won't leave him alone.

156
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.850
Here is the cartoon "Yankee Doodle Daffy."

157
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.683
Enjoy.

158
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.823
I'd better hurry.

159
00:15:31.823 --> 00:15:33.933
I just got 10 minutes to catch my plane.

160
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.130
Hold everything. fatso!

161
00:15:51.273 --> 00:15:55.740
Pew.

162
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.415
This is your lucky day!

163
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.377
Opportunity is knocking.

164
00:16:00.777 --> 00:16:03.600
But I've got very important appointment.

165
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.223
I'll say you have. My card.

166
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.840
Yes sir. Daffy Duck.

167
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.980
Personal representative

168
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.550
of the most sensational
discovery since the sweater girl.

169
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.260
He's colossal. Stupendous.

170
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
One might even go so far
as to say he's mediocre.

171
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.110
I give you that paragon
of pep and personality.

172
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.523
Sleepy Lagoon.

173
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.008
Picture a packed house.

174
00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:39.841
The kid's on.

175
00:16:39.841 --> 00:16:40.674
the orchestra gives him

176
00:16:40.674 --> 00:16:43.323
a four bar vamp and the kid
gives it to 'em like this!

find these immortal favorites.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.283
Sleeping Beauty.

248
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.770
Remember the lovely princess

249
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.717
who was bewitched into a deep slumber

250
00:22:06.717 --> 00:22:09.783
until her Prince Charming
came to break the spell?

251
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.294

Tom Thumb. a
little boy who got his name

255
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.740
because he was no bigger
than a man's thumb.

256
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.840
Let's pay this interesting family a visit.

257
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.303
Good evening. Mr. and Mrs.
Thumb. where's little Tom?

258

Yeah. That's me.

260
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.970
Why. I
thought you were no bigger

261
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.023

You are gonna be sorry!

268
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.180
I've worked all summer and put
away plenty for the winter.

269
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.550

00:24:13.777 --> 00:24:15.194
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

278
00:24:26.433 --> 00:24:28.860

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.658
What a dope!

280
00:24:30.658 --> 00:24:32.190

could stand some discipline.

a ferocious. two-headed giant

287
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.213
who forced Jack to run for his life.

288
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.239
Say. you almost had him.

289
00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:13.563

298
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.910
All Aladdin had to do was to rub the lamp.

299
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.973

As we continue our
compilation of stories

342
00:29:19.255 --> 00:29:21.870
about traveling to new worlds.

343
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.310
we have to include Dorothy's
trip to the Land of Oz.

344
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.090
This Wizard of Oz
cartoon came out in 1933.

345
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.180
six years before the famous
"Wizard of Oz" movie.

346
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.640
This cartoon is also very
different from the movie

347
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.890
and it's only nine minutes long.

348
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.330
It's also one of the very first

349
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.400
full color cartoons in its day.

350
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.687

369
00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:45.690
Two castaways who have
been floating out at sea

370
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.940

371
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.470
are both very hungry.

372
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.740
And as soon as they see
Bugs. they want to eat him.

373
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.723
How did Bugs end up on this island?

374
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.940

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:30.492
Skip the gutter.

I wish there was a boardwalk
on this beach. Huh?

647
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:03.582
Oh. that was me that was giving way. huh?

648
00:56:03.582 --> 00:56:04.415
Whoa!

649
00:56:04.415 --> 00:56:05.248
Well!

650
00:56:11.047 --> 00:56:12.040
There's a violation

651
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.507
for not having no exit
that you can go into. huh?

652
00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:16.338
Oh. it's quite modern in this steakhouse.

653
00:56:16.338 --> 00:56:18.948
I'll tell you that.

654
00:56:18.948 --> 00:56:19.781
I hope this isn't a one way street.

655
00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:20.614
Tippy toe. tippy toe. tippy toe.

656
00:56:20.614 --> 00:56:22.332
I gotta give all these
jewels back to the people.

657
00:56:22.332 --> 00:56:23.422
Tippy toe. tippy toe. tippy toe.

00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:24.985
I hope I see them before they see me.

Tippy toe. tippy toe. tippy toe.

Oh. hello Wimpy. How did you

That's what I wish. huh?

681
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.079
Oh. just a little flounder that's all.

Whoa!

683
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:09.401

00:58:09.401 --> 00:58:10.446

How does that strike ya?

710
01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:09.266

712
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:38.859
I'm Popeye the Sailor Man!

713
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.880
And there you have it.

714
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.411
Our collection of

715
01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:46.470
"The Greatest Cartoons of
the Golden Era: Volume 3."

716
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:47.760
For thousands of years.

717
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.470
storytellers have told tales

718
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.050
of characters traveling to new worlds.

719
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:55.350
Originally. these tales
were told around campfires.

720
01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.510
Later they were written into books.

721
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.150
Nowadays these stories
are told through film.

722
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.310
Why are these stories so popular?

723
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.920
Probably because in films
we can travel to places

724
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.960
we'd never be able to visit in real life.

725
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.730
We can experience new places.
