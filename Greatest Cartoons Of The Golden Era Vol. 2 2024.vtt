Hi. I'm Charles Dewandeler and welcome

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.020
to "Greatest Cartoons of
the Golden Era. Volume 2."

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.730
If you enjoyed our first compilation.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
you'll love volume two

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.930
because these cartoons are even better.

14
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.907
Our first cartoon is a
spoof of the 1942 movie.

15
00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.640
"The Man Who Came To Dinner."

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.450
The cartoon is called "The
Wabbit Who Came to Supper."

17
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.760
and it stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

18
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.593
Enjoy.

19
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:13.680
I'm trapped. Trapped.

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.037
I gotta get out of this.

21
00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:16.829
I gotta think fast.

22
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.024
Trapped.

23
00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:24.056
Oh boy. they trapped
the wabbit.

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:40.048

Eh. what's up. doc?

107
00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:24.510
Today we're gonna watch not one.

108
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.920
but two of the greatest
Superman cartoons ever made.

109
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.300
The first cartoon reminds me

110
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.460
of recent movies I've
seen like "Terminator."

111
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.010
which feature robots with
artificial intelligence

112
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.960
trying to take over the world.

113
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.730
This cartoon is a similar concept.

114
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.400
but it came out over 80 years ago.

115
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.246
Here now is Superman in
"The Mechanical Monsters."

116
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.290
Faster
than a speeding bullet.

117
00:08:49.123 --> 00:08:50.673
more powerful than a locomotive.

118
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.060
able to leap tall buildings
at a single bound.

119
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.850
this amazing stranger
from the planet Krypton.

120
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.256
the Man of Steel.

121
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.459
Superman!

122
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.410
Empowered with x-Ray vision.

123
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.840
possessing remarkable physical strength.

124
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.970
Superman fights a never-ending battle

125
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.770
for truth and justice

126
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.054
disguised as a mild-mannered
newspaper reporter. Clark Kent.

127
00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:25.317
Lois! What are you doing here?

128
00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.865
Oh. just getting the
woman's angle on this story.

129
00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:33.449
The mechanical monster! Look out!

130
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.514
Come on. you fool. Do
you wanna get trampled?

131
00:12:18.897 --> 00:12:21.114
Now you wait here. I'll phone this in.

132
00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:40.849
Yes. I'll give you the
details later. Chief.

133
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.190
All right. Lois...

134
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.556
Lois!

135
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.927
This is a job for Superman.

136
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.618
What a story this is going to make.

137
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.533
The jewels. What have
you done with the jewels?

138
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.651
You'll read about it
in tomorrow's paper.

139
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:24.173
Are you going to tell me
what happened to those jewels?

140
00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:15.054
So you won't tell me.

141
00:15:18.437 --> 00:15:20.854
You'll soon change your mind.

142
00:15:38.942 --> 00:15:39.975
Superman.

143
00:17:00.063 --> 00:17:03.375
Take one more step and she's doomed.

144
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.890
That's a wonderful story. Lois.

145
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.408
Thanks. Clark. but I
owe it all to Superman.

146
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.690
Our next cartoon is directed
by legendary Chuck Jones

147
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.530
and Star's Daffy Duck with Elmer Fudd.

148
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.420
This time. Elmer Fudd is taking a break

149
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.080
from hunting rabbits so he can hunt ducks.

150
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.820
Daffy Duck doesn't like this very much.

151
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.120
so he challenges Elmer to a boxing match.

152
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.953
Enjoy.

153
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.323
Duck shot.

154
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.473
More duck shot.

155
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.340
Confidentially. those hunters couldn't hit

156
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.983
the broad side of a duck.

157
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:54.253
Ah! They got me.

158
00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:55.388
Yipe.

159
00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:02.802
Get him. Laramore.

160
00:19:02.802 --> 00:19:05.403
Retrieve him. Retrieve him.

161
00:19:05.403 --> 00:19:07.110
Take it easy. Rover.

162
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.420
That's no way to retrieve a duck.

163
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.027
Look.

164
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.363
Gentle like. See. Laramore?

165
00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:22.630
Hello.

166
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.070
Sorry I had to plug you. Mr.
Duck. but I am a sportsman.

167
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.623
a great. great sportsman.

168
00:19:30.827 --> 00:19:32.827
A great sportsman. eh?

169
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.293
Sportsman.

170
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.020
Listen. sport. you don't know
the meaning of fair play.

171
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.300
What chance has a poor. helpless.

172
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.230
fluffy little winged
creature like me against you?

173
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.330
You with your bullets. and your shotgun.

174
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.760
and your knife. and your duck
call. and your hunting coat.

175
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.703
and your hunting dog. and all
kinda stuff like that there!

176
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.190
What protection have I got?

177
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.940
A bulletproof vest. I suppose.

178
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.090
How did that get there?

179
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.250
How would you like to meet me
in a fair fight. Mr. Sport?

180
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.950
All things being equal. man to man.

181
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.990

Don't like it.

189
00:20:40.192 --> 00:20:44.730
Ladies and gentle ducks!

190
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.159
In that corner...

191
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.704
In that corner.

192
00:20:56.704 --> 00:20:59.430
He's a dog.

193
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.933
You can have him.

No rough stuff.

206
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.139
None of this.

207
00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:04.550
Or this.

208
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.120
Or like so.

209
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.780
Or this. or this. or this.

210
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.001
You understand?

211
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.187
Yeah. you mean none of this.

212
00:22:15.187 --> 00:22:16.565
Or this.

213
00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:18.255
Or like so.

214
00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:19.851
Or this.

215
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:21.057
Or this.

216
00:22:21.057 --> 00:22:23.554
Or this. or this?

217
00:22:23.554 --> 00:22:25.920
Or this. huh?

218
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.181
How about a little of this?

219
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:32.612
Absolutely uh-uh.

220
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.100
You know. there's
something awfully screwy

221
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.383
about this fight. or
my name isn't Laramore.

222
00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:44.788
And it isn't.

223
00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:50.854
You got him punchy. champ.

224
00:22:50.854 --> 00:22:53.254
He's practically a dead duck already.

225
00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:54.618
Now get in there and fight.

226
00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:55.894
Go on in there. knock him out!

227
00:22:55.894 --> 00:22:56.854
Give it to him. champ.

228
00:22:56.854 --> 00:22:59.194
Let him have it. champ!

229
00:22:59.194 --> 00:23:01.710
Huh. gettin' a little thin on top.

230
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.070
How about a little somethin'
to stimulate the scalp?

231
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.615
Now shake hands.

232
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.710
Which hand do you take?

233
00:23:19.622 --> 00:23:22.327
Mm. uh. that one.

234
00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:24.614
Nope.

235
00:23:24.614 --> 00:23:26.197
Wrong. Guess again.

236
00:23:27.134 --> 00:23:31.608
All right. all right. I'll
take that over there.

237
00:23:31.608 --> 00:23:32.583
Ain't he a dope?

238
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.825
Ya sure this is the one you want?

239
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.837
You're right!

240
00:23:38.837 --> 00:23:40.420
It's the right one.

241
00:23:41.747 --> 00:23:44.703
And here's round one comin' up.

242
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.310
One. three. nine. ten. you're out!

243
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.420
The winner and new champion. Daffy Duck!

244
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.600
I'm not the one to
complain. Mr. Referee.

245
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.090
but I thought you said no rough stuff.

246
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.511
None of this. or this.

247
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:12.003
or this. or like so.

248
00:24:12.003 --> 00:24:15.183
Or this. or this. or this!

249
00:24:18.446 --> 00:24:23.070
That's all. folks!

250
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.320
It seems like in the
early days of animation.

251
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.790
everybody was making their own version

252
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.770
of a Cinderella cartoon.

253
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.600
This cartoon was brought to us

254
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.190
by the Fleischer brothers and stars

255
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.530
one of their most popular characters.

256
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.000
No. not Superman.

257
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.160
This was years before Superman.

258
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.460
This cartoon stars
Betty Boop as Cinderella

259
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.040
and is one of her only
cartoons which were in color.

260
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.930
Something I love about
the Fleischer cartoons

261
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.260
is how they tried making
scenes in their movies look 3D.

262
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.170
something which Disney and
other animation companies

263
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.090
would later try to copy.

264
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.079

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.530
Ub Iwerks was an
animator who became famous

342
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.750
for his many years
working with Walt Disney.

343
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.610
He helped co-create Mickey Mouse

344
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.460
and animate many of

In 1930. Ub Iwerks left Disney

346
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.620
and started his own animation company.

347
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.370
This next cartoon is one of his
best. called "Balloon Land."

348
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.280
It features a world where
everything is made of balloons.

349
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.780
It even features balloon versions

350
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.026
of Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin.

351
00:35:31.057 --> 00:35:32.430

I'm coming.

371
00:37:42.168 --> 00:37:43.680
I'm scared.

372
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.106
I'm not. Much.

373
00:37:53.397 --> 00:37:58.397
I'm the old Pin Cushion
Man. terror of Balloony Land.

374
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.100
Folks all hate me. how they hate me.

375
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.100
Tickles me the way they rate me.

376
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.074
Always have a pin at hand.

377
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:10.620
That's the reason I am panned.

378
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.411
How I stop 'em when I pop 'em?

379
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.823
Aw. that Pin Cushion Man's a fake.

380
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.354
I'm not afraid of his pins.

381
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.873
So you're not afraid of pins?

382
00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:07.754
Let me in!

383
00:39:09.089 --> 00:39:11.782
Let me in! I'll get mad in a minute!

384
00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:15.878
Open the gates! I wanna come in!

385
00:39:15.878 --> 00:39:18.515
I'd better not.

386
00:39:18.515 --> 00:39:22.220
The folks'd blow up if I let you in.

387
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.120
Nonsense. I'm your friend.

388
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.021
I want to give you something.

389
00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:28.938
Oh. that's different.

390
00:39:33.468 --> 00:39:36.054
What are you going to give me?

391
00:39:36.054 --> 00:39:37.571
This!

392
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:39.402
You-

393
00:39:41.725 --> 00:39:43.021
The Pin Cushion Man!

394
00:39:43.021 --> 00:39:44.832
Quick. we must sound the alarm.

395
00:40:39.683 --> 00:40:41.412
The Pin Cushion Man!

396
00:40:41.412 --> 00:40:42.286
Holy smoke!

397
00:41:21.925 --> 00:41:23.942
Ready. aim. fire!

398
00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:35.751
Arm tacks!

399
00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:51.462
Fire!

400
00:42:25.227 --> 00:42:28.170
And now our second Superman cartoon.

401
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.893
In this cartoon there's been
a murder at Metropolis Museum.

402
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.560
When Clark Kent goes to investigate.

403
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.280
he finds out the mummies
have come back to life.

404
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.670
Gee. a movie about mummies
coming back to life.

405
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.840
It seems like this is a story

406
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.610
I've seen a lot in movies lately.

407
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.970
except this cartoon came out in 1943.

408
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:52.076
Here now is Superman
in "The Mummy Strikes."

409
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.810
Faster than
a streak of lightning.

410
00:42:56.585 --> 00:42:59.402
More powerful than a pounding surf.

411
00:43:02.843 --> 00:43:04.897
Mightier than a roaring hurricane.

412
00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:09.819
This amazing stranger
from the planet Krypton.

413
00:43:09.819 --> 00:43:11.148
the Man of Steel.

414
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.323
Superman!

415
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.160
Possessing remarkable physical strength.

416
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.200
Superman fights a never-ending battle

417
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.000
for truth and justice.

418
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.235
disguised as a mild-mannered
newspaper reporter. Clark Kent.

419
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.303
Dr. Jordan. Dr. Jordan!

420
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.700
You deny poisoning Dr. Jordan.

421
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.950
yet you admit these
fingerprints are yours.

422
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.540
Yes. but. but you don't-

423
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.863
That's all.

424
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.100
Kent speaking.

425
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.570
Hello. "Daily Planet"?

426
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.970
This is Dr. Wilson of the Egyptian Museum.

427
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.000
I've just uncovered something
that may free Miss Hogan.

428
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.940
Yes. Doctor. I've been
feeling much better lately.

429
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.010
but I'll be right over.

430
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.936
I'll see ya later. Lois. Doctor's orders.

431
00:44:56.769 --> 00:44:58.383
Doctor. my eye.

432
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.180
Dr. Jordan was the
world's foremost student

433
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.380
of hieroglyphics.

434
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.620
Most of our priceless specimens
were brought back by him.

435
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.440
even the mummy of King Tush.

436
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.730
Among his possessions.

437
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.340
I uncovered this ancient Egyptian tablet

438
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.340
and find it to be a secret
curse of the tomb of King Tush.

439
00:45:28.447 --> 00:45:31.020
"He who disturbs the eternal sleep

440
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.230
of King Tush shall perish."

441
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.410
This tablet may well be Miss
Hogan's passport to freedom.

442
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.990
Come with me. please.

443
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.960
Over 3.000 years ago. the
Valley of the Upper Nile

444
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.290
was ruled by an old and powerful king.

445
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.380
He had been warring with the
Lower Nile for many years.

446
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.480
and just before the old king died.

447
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.050
he called his son to
him. a young boy of 12.

448
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.630
He commanded his giant
guards swear an oath

449
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.940
of eternal allegiance to the boy prince.

450
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.750
to guard him constantly in
this world and the next.

451
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.330
Shortly after. the old king died.

452
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.930
A youth of 12 now ruled a
kingdom of 10 million people.

453
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.680
But the boy was not fashioned
for such responsibility.

454
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.910
and being of a sickly nature.
soon became ill himself.

455
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:39.720
Never was a person attended
more faithfully than this youth.

456
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.110
yet he withered away and soon died.

457
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.000
True to their oath of allegiance.

458
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.640
each of the royal guards drank poison

459
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.670
so that they might continue
to protect the spirit

460
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.993
of their young king in
the Valley of the Dead.

461
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.440
Here in these catacombs.

462
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.410
Dr. Jordan has reconstructed
the burial vault

463
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.370
exactly as he first discovered
it in one of the pyramids.

464
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:09.270
Working for years in absolute
and frenzied secrecy.

465
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.510
he finally duplicated an
ancient mystic formula.

466
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.821
which he called the Fluid of Life.

467
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.410
Just before he was found dead.

468
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.140
Dr. Jordan had inoculated
each of the mummies

469
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.820
of the giant guards.

470
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.070
They were supposed to return to life.

471
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.421
but somehow the test failed.

472
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:36.000
Dr. Jordan was found here
at the feet of King Tush.

473
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.440
The rest you know.

474
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.240
But what you don't know. Mr. Kent.

475
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.070
and what I am equally certain of.

476
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:44.430
is that Dr. Jordan violated
the ancient warning

477
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.865
by attempting to open
the coffin of King Tush!

478
00:47:56.788 --> 00:47:58.170
A poisonous needle.

479
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.870
That's how Dr. Jordan was killed.

480
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:03.427
Yes. and Miss Hogan is a free woman.

481
00:48:12.113 --> 00:48:13.119
Lois!

482
00:49:34.991 --> 00:49:36.824
"Jane Hogan Set Free."

483
00:49:39.745 --> 00:49:42.180
This is one time
I've scooped you. Lois.

484
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.430
Yes. lucky for you I was hurt.

485
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.983
Incidentally. who told
you I was at the museum?

486
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.783
My mummy done told me.

487
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.170
Our final cartoon today
is again brought to us

488
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.370
by the Fleischer brothers

489
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.800
and stars one of their
most popular characters.

490
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.510
Popeye the Sailor Man.

491
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.660
This was actually Popeye's
first color cartoon

492
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.730
and was nominated for best short subject

493
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.897
in the 1936 Academy Awards.

494
00:50:13.897 --> 00:50:15.780
It was voted number 17

495
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.060
in the 50 greatest cartoons of all time.

496
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.430
and some say it served as inspiration

497
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.730
for future Sinbad movies and
just pirate movies in general.

498
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.480
Here now is "Popeye the Sailor
Meets Sinbad the Sailor."

499
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.388
