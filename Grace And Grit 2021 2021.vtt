3
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.902
Thank you.

4
00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.072
I have one more for you.
called "I Want To Live."

5
00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:41.142
But first I'd like to introduce
a dear friend of mine

6
00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.943
who's going to share
a few words.

7
00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.578
Treya Wilber.

8
00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:52.120
Thank you.

9
00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:52.820
Yeah.

10
00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:07.935
Hello.

11
00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.904
My name is
Treya Killam Wilber.

12
00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.007
Many of you here
have known me as Terry.

13
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:19.147
I've been involved with
Windstar from the early days.

14
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.816
Five years ago.
in August of '83.

15
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.620
I met and totally fell in love
with Ken Wilber.

16
00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:30.291
I always used to call it
love at first touch.

17
00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.903
"Dear Friends.

18
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.807
Remember those lists
I used to make...

19
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.345
my wish list
for the perfect man?

20
00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:53.681
Well. at 36.
I certainly didn't think

21
00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:57.818
that man
could still happen to me.

22
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.889
Yep. love.
I've finally found him.

23
00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.925
His name is Ken Wilber.

24
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.660
Maybe you've heard of him.

25
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:10.198
He's revered as "the Einstein
of Consciousness."

26
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.600
At the CAL Institute
for Psychological Studies

27
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:19.139
was where I first read
this Mr. Wilber's work.

28
00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:21.642
I didn't think much of this
until a few weeks later

29
00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:23.844
when Frances called
to invite me to dinner with Ken

30
00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.247
at her and Roger's home.

31
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.849
It needs to be explored
and maybe you'll find that
answer.

32
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.819
Uh. we're
trying to have kids.

33
00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.321
but it's not working.

34
00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:34.322
Ken and I
just barely had a chance

35
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.123
to say hello
when our two friends

36
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.960
began to bring up some problems
in their relationship.

37
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.830
-It's important to
differentiate. to understand...

38
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.265
Ken was asked to be therapist

39
00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.933
for the evening.

40
00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.167
But it's like
there's something stopping...

41
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.202
But the love is there.

42
00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:49.970
Which was fine.

43
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.839
because it gave me some time
to get used to his shaved head.

44
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:07.715
-So. um. Frances and Roger
told me you're like.

45
00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.783
the most amazing woman
to walk the planet.

46
00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:17.057
Please...

47
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.963
They say you're amazing too.

48
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.951
Well. good night.

49
00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.019
Bye. and good night.

50
00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:48.522
-Hey. look. um...

51
00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:49.890
I know this sounds strange.

52
00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:55.028
but when I hugged you
in the kitchen.

53
00:04:55.062 --> 00:05:00.133
I felt like...

54
00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:04.805
I never wanted to let you go.

55
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:05.839
-Yeah.
-

56
00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:11.379
-Yeah. me too...

57
00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:13.981
Good night.
-Good night.

58
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.502
-I found her.

59
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:43.210
I've really found her.

60
00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:47.381
I noticed a series of subtle

61
00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:49.116
energy currents
running through my body

62
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:53.387
like an earnest series...

63
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.589
The softness of the air...

64
00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:56.924
...slow energy currents

65
00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.493
an energy that lies asleep
until aroused by

66
00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:01.895
the right person or event.
An energy...

67
00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.296
Be touched like that.

68
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.035
Deep caring. like he touched me.

69
00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.503
-...the right person.

70
00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:11.338
-Gentleness.

71
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.441
An energy
that seemed to radiate from her

72
00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:14.875
in all directions.

73
00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.444
Willingness to support.

74
00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:19.379
First through his words
and what it showed of him...

75
00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.015
An energy of vast intelligence

76
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:23.283
from the right person...

77
00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:26.186
Asking questions.

78
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.857
The depth of his brown eyes.
and then an easy melting.

79
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.292
Suffused with beauty.

80
00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:36.897
But mostly an energy
that was alive.

81
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.504
This woman said life more than
anyone I had ever known.

82
00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:48.041
Of truth...

83
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.343
and finding it.

84
00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.146
And God. she was alive!

85
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.115
The softness.

86
00:06:55.148 --> 00:07:01.021
I trust him more than...
as if I already know him.

87
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:15.569
In case
I read this in the future.

88
00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:18.639
just to be clear.

89
00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:26.179
Treya and I have
not slept together.

90
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.481
We simply put our arms
around each other.

91
00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:31.218
once in the kitchen.
and once shortly after.

92
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.989
That was the sum total
of our involvement.

93
00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:39.927
Though I certainly sense
there is more to come.

94
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.961
I became obsessed

95
00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:42.663
with the thought of Ken...

96
00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:10.490
I'll take all these.

97
00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:13.260
I-I'm just checking them out
for some friends.

98
00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:15.629
-Hm.

99
00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:18.498
So. then I got a job
as a dishwasher.

100
00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:22.102
earning 350 dollars a month
and sending 100 of that

101
00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:26.707
to Sam at Shambhala Publications
for mail order books.

102
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.678
And I wrote that book.

103
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.315
The Spectrum of Consciousness .
I loved it.

104
00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:40.688
And then five more books
in five years. Right?

105
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:42.322
-Have you been stalking me?

106
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.191
-Yeah. I'm looking for a good
dishwasher.

107
00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:47.728
-Yeah.
I bus tables too. ya know.

108
00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:02.442
-What's something that no one
probably knows about you?

109
00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:08.115
-I wrote out all of
Alan Watts' books by hand.

110
00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:11.284
-All right.
that's pretty exhausting.

111
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:14.521
I don't think
anybody needs to know that.

112
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:21.194
-So why are you
a psychologist?

113
00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:22.796
-I think growing up.
I never had a place

114
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.233
to put my thoughts and feelings.

115
00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:28.201
My parents are wonderful.

116
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:32.205
highly conventional.

117
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.608
-Mm. The old guard?

118
00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:37.645
-They did well
in oil and investments.

119
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:41.114
And I think it's just
reflective of the social circles

120
00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:42.415
they're in as well.

121
00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:49.356
But they love
me enormously.

122
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:50.658
Anyhow. it makes it

123
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.425
so that I can afford to date
authors. you know.

124
00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:55.062
Well. that's okay.

125
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.397
You know.
I'm a great dishwasher.

126
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.932
and I sell a few books.

127
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:17.785
Has anything like this
ever happened to you?

128
00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:20.553
-No.

129
00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:23.824
Nothing like this.

130
00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:26.694
How about you?

131
00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:33.333
-Never. not like this.

132
00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.403
-Oh. god.

133
00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.438
-It's bigger
than the two of us. pilgrim.

134
00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:17.444
-So you've only known him
a few weeks. Treya!

135
00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.880
-And you've never
raved about a guy. like ever.

136
00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:23.683
-Mm-hm. And you have not
dated a boy in over two years.

137
00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:29.622
-I know. I know.
He's. he's amazing.

138
00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:32.760
He's just so lovable.

139
00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:37.697
-So you think you might get.
you know. you might?

140
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:38.799
You better.

141
00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:43.570
-I think well...yes!
We will get married.

142
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.209
-Oh. my god. Finally!

143
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.913
-I haven't heard you
say that word

144
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:55.515
since you were three years old
when you used to play dress up.

145
00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.794
-Not only do I approve.

146
00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:09.262
I'm a little worried
she's getting shortchanged. pal.

147
00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:12.665
-I know.
-

148
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.652
-So what did you
tell Sam about me?

149
00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:39.827
-Let's see. Hmmm. No. I told Sam
that if she'll have me.

150
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.932
that... this is the girl
that I'd like to marry.

151
00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:48.268
-Of course.

152
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:54.574
I was gonna ask you.

153
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.952
-When I met your daddy.

154
00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:09.556
I was so busy with my life.
but I knew he was the one.

155
00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:13.393
-It's all
I've ever wanted for you.

156
00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:17.530
So I want you to know. honey:
I am here for you.

157
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:21.034
come rain or come shine.
Love you.

158
00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:26.539
-Mom.

159
00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:27.807
-Go get your man.

160
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:43.390
-I love you
more than life.

161
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.295
I just can't believe it's real.

162
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:55.035
I've known you
less than four months.

163
00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:59.339
-I've been searching
for you for a hundred lifetimes.

164
00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:05.312
I've slain a thousand dragons
to find you.

165
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.015
I love you
to the depths of the ocean.

166
00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.417
beyond the height
of the mountains.

167
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.419
beyond the heat of the sun...

168
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.388
beyond time...

169
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:19.492
forever. Forever.

170
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.475
-Let's go get married.

171
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.359
-You know.
when I recently opened up

172
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.395
a box of books that Treya
sent to me. I thought.

173
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:59.132
"Ah. Treya has discovered
my favorite writer."

174
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.834
And then I opened her letter.

175
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.904
"Oh. Treya is marrying
my favorite writer."

176
00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:09.909
-Ken. Treya. you're
gathered here today

177
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:13.446
being bound not only as lovers.
but as souls

178
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.683
to continually bring out
the courageous and beautiful

179
00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:18.851
from inside one another.

180
00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:23.090
And here. now. like a bridge
joining two lands.

181
00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:26.559
we witness the joining
of these two souls through love.

182
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.696
entering into a dance
from this day forward

183
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:33.733
to unite separateness.
to pierce time.

184
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:41.041
and to leap together
into eternity.

185
00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:46.980
-I will take you from here
to forever and never let you go.

186
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:52.519
-I will take you from here
to forever and never let you go.

187
00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:54.721
-My wife.

188
00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:17.910
-Please stand.

189
00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:46.806
-I know. Mom. it's a miracle.

190
00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:49.542
I finish classes.
Ken has some final editing.

191
00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:52.579
and then Hawaii.

192
00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:53.646
-Hawaii?

193
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.614
Yes. Hawaii.

194
00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:56.949
So we'll see you at Christmas.

195
00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:59.786
-All right.
Um. you know. honey...

196
00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:03.790
I'm...I'm just not crazy
about his writing.

197
00:17:03.823 --> 00:17:05.492
I just opened it.

198
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.994
and there was a picture
of somebody humping.

199
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.562
-Mom. Mom. I gotta go.

200
00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.697
-But as long as you're happy.

201
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.964
-Okay. Bye. Mom.

202
00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:14.067
-All right. Love you.

203
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:19.106
I love you too.

204
00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.774
-I guess I said
the wrong thing.

205
00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:29.916
Okay.

206
00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:33.286
And now I'm gonna examine
the left breast.

207
00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.896
Now I'm going to do the right.

208
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:08.188
Do you know you have
a lump in your right breast?

209
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.756
-What?

210
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:14.561
-Well. it's fairly
large and hard.

211
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.997
But it's not attached to
the muscle and moves easily.

212
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.900
My guess is
it's nothing to worry about.

213
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.635
Maybe just a cyst.

214
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.771
-What do you think
we should do?

215
00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.207
-Why don't we wait a month and
see if it changes in size.

216
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.709
It could change
with your menstrual cycle.

217
00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:30.977
Come back
and see me in a month.

218
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.011
Okay.

219
00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.998
-It's hard. which is bad.

220
00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:54.667
But it's symmetrical
and detached.

221
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:57.870
which is good.
so don't worry.

222
00:18:57.904 --> 00:19:02.875
Let's get a second opinion.

223
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:07.280
And no. nothing is gonna
tear me away from you.

224
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.383
-Nothing.

225
00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:12.652
Good. Mr. Wilber.

226
00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:14.321
I hope not.

227
00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:20.227
I think you're done for tonight.

228
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.228
-Bye-bye. book.

229
00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:27.099
-Bye-bye. book.
-

230
00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:29.736
-If only I could have everything

231
00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:33.873
that's inside of
this beautiful mind.

232
00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:34.907
-If only I could have everything

233
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:43.115
inside this beautiful heart.

234
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:52.759
-All right. ready?

235
00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:55.061
Mm.

236
00:19:55.094 --> 00:20:01.000
It's probably a fibroadenoma.
a benign growth.

237
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:05.672
Should definitely
have it removed.

238
00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.374
-We--we leave
for our honeymoon.

239
00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:09.376
and then we're gone
for two weeks over Christmas.

240
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:10.777
Can it wait?

241
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.944
Yes. I think so.

242
00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:13.980
No danger in waiting
three weeks.

243
00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:18.117
Though. I want you to see
a surgeon for his opinion.

244
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.986
Um. Dr. Peter Richards.

245
00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:22.154
His office is close
to Marin General.

246
00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:25.024
Um. you know. let's give him
a call in my office.

247
00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.959
He might want to fit you in
before the trip.

248
00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:27.994
Okay?
-Okay.

249
00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:29.762
-Oh. Dr. Peter Richards.

250
00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:31.931
He is wonderful.

251
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:38.004
He did my colon operation
15 years ago at M.D. Anderson.

252
00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:39.105
-He's the Chief of Surgery

253
00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:41.140
at Children's
Hospital in San Fran now.

254
00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:43.142
He says
it's probably nothing but

255
00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.111
just to be safe.
he wants to take it out.

256
00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:46.746
Anyhow.
I gotta go pack.

257
00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.482
-So you have
your exam tomorrow and then

258
00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:51.250
you're counseling.
Is that right?

259
00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:53.920
-Yes. Dr. Richards
will remove the lump

260
00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:56.222
the next day before we fly.

261
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.791
-Oh? All right.

262
00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:01.193
And Ken is taking
good care of you?

263
00:21:01.227 --> 00:21:02.995
-Of course he is. Mom.

264
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:04.497
-Well. I just...

265
00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:05.765
-You just what?

266
00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:07.300
-Oh. nothing. honey.
I just. uh--

267
00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:09.336
-Mom. listen.

268
00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.037
I know what you think

269
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.273
and not everyone understands
or agrees with his books.

270
00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:16.142
But. you know. he's more than

271
00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:18.878
what's just written
in those books. okay?

272
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.947
-All right.

273
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.449
-I love you. I've
got to go pack.

274
00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:23.916
-I love you.

275
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.485
-Bye.

276
00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:28.220
-Safe flight.

277
00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:39.098
-Honey. are we gonna do
that swim across the bay?

278
00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:42.134
-Is the Pope Catholic?

279
00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:43.302
-Uh huh.

280
00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:45.104
-Does a one-legged duck
swim in circles?

281
00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.407
Yes.

282
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.175
-Was Jesus a carpenter?

283
00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:53.045
-Does an obnoxious husband
think that he's gonna

284
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:56.516
get me tonight
by asking silly questions?

285
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:57.950
-Oh. that's nice.

286
00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.051
-It is nice.

287
00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:04.791
-Soft...

288
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.258
So. do you think
we're gonna find dolphins

289
00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:08.094
out there in that ocean?

290
00:22:08.127 --> 00:22:09.328
Mm-hm.

291
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:11.431
Maybe we can see
some whales?

292
00:22:12.532 --> 00:22:13.933
Or sharks.

293
00:22:13.966 --> 00:22:16.135
This little bay
right here. No sharks!

294
00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:22.875
So how old were you

295
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:25.011
when you started menstruating?

296
00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:26.513
Maybe 14.

297
00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:29.549
Okay.
Have you ever had a child?

298
00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:31.350
-Uh. no.
I've never been pregnant.

299
00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:32.952
-Okay.

300
00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:35.455
Has anyone in your family
had breast cancer?

301
00:22:35.488 --> 00:22:37.223
-Not that I know of.

302
00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:41.127
-Okay.
And has the lump ever hurt?

303
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.362
-No. never.

304
00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:45.364
-Okay.
Are you nervous

305
00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:49.035
about the operation.
about the local anesthesia?

306
00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:51.137
I mean. if you--if you are.
we can give you something.

307
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.972
No. I feel fine.

308
00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:54.541
Good.
And do you eat meat?

309
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:56.443
Nope. Vegetarian.

310
00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:57.410
Oh. good for you.

311
00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.046
All right.

312
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:08.648
-Hi. I'd like to see
the Wilbers in my office.

313
00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:09.616
Okay.
-Good.

314
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:20.693
-I'm sorry.
But the tumor is malignant.

315
00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:29.569
-And. um.
the detailed results are--?

316
00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:31.170
-Yeah. let me get that for you.

317
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:38.578
Can I get a nurse in my office
with the Wilber chart. please?

318
00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:41.447
-How? It's so unfair.

319
00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.087
-This is crazy.

320
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.589
Most medical and scientific
information

321
00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:52.324
is either inconclusive
or negative.

322
00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:54.293
-Okay. I just read
a New Age perspective

323
00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:57.664
that says illness is a lesson.

324
00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:59.131
While most alternative
information

325
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:01.367
is unrelenting and positive.

326
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.670
Did you see
that Woody Allen quote?

327
00:25:03.703 --> 00:25:05.171
-It looks like everybody
who gets treated

328
00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:07.574
by orthodox medicine dies.

329
00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:11.711
"I don't get angry.
I grow tumors instead."

330
00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:14.146
-The one who gets treated with
the alternative medicine lives.

331
00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:18.150
-A film with
a giant squirting boob

332
00:25:18.184 --> 00:25:20.319
as a character in it.

333
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.588
Condemned to meaning.

334
00:25:23.322 --> 00:25:25.091
-Are we wearing
matching outfits?

335
00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:31.664
By curiosity.
or whatever design...

336
00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:41.273
-Okay. Mr. Wilber.

337
00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:44.811
I'll make the list.

338
00:25:46.613 --> 00:25:49.348
A period of depression
I went through.

339
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:53.319
repressing some emotions.
eating too much animal fat.

340
00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:58.124
Is it possible that somewhere
inside ... worrying ...

341
00:25:58.157 --> 00:26:00.326
part of me
doesn't want to live?

342
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.195
Being too self-critical.

343
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.531
I just don't want you to
have to worry about me.

344
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.634
Lonely as a child maybe.

345
00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:09.669
People saying it's caused
by repressed emotions

346
00:26:09.702 --> 00:26:11.103
don't know
what they're talking about.

347
00:26:11.137 --> 00:26:12.538
-Not meeting Ken sooner.

348
00:26:15.642 --> 00:26:17.777
So. what do you think?

349
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.811
-I like the last one.

350
00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:25.685
I don't know what caused it.
sweetheart.

351
00:26:25.718 --> 00:26:27.453
and I don't think anybody does.

352
00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:29.221
-Ken. I'm scared.

353
00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:39.531
-As long as you're
breathing and crying.

354
00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:41.367
I won't worry about you.

355
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.270
Now. if you stop either one.
then I'll worry.

356
00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:55.181
If you want to make
any changes.

357
00:26:55.214 --> 00:26:57.784
don't do any of them because
you think they caused it.

358
00:27:00.887 --> 00:27:03.589
Do it because
you want to do it anyway.

359
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:07.493
Hm? Look...

360
00:27:09.896 --> 00:27:12.398
let's make it
a new beginning. Hm?

361
00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:16.703
-You promise?

362
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:27.613
-I love you.

363
00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:40.426
-Okay. it's a new procedure.

364
00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:41.861
It was pioneered in Europe.

365
00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:44.663
And I think you'd be
a really good candidate for it.

366
00:27:44.697 --> 00:27:47.834
You see. these tumors are
the Nazis of the cancer crowd

367
00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:49.201
and they're not
terribly impressed with

368
00:27:49.235 --> 00:27:51.137
wheatgrass or sweet thoughts.

369
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.706
I mean. you got to
nuke these bastards.

370
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.341
As a matter of fact.
I had a discussion about it

371
00:27:55.374 --> 00:27:57.476
with your mom and Rad
right after I'd read about it.

372
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:01.781
-Babe?

373
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:04.817
-Um. we've certainly
done the research

374
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:07.186
on the various combinations.

375
00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:08.320
-For sure.

376
00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:11.824
Okay.

377
00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:16.796
Segmental mastectomy.
that'll save lymph nodes.

378
00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:18.330
Followed by radiation

379
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:21.467
and a spectrum
of holistic treatments.

380
00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:24.270
I like this.

381
00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:26.672
-Okay.

382
00:28:39.819 --> 00:28:41.921
-Babe. I can't believe
this is our honeymoon.

383
00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:47.593
-We'll be there in Hawaii.
I'll wear that bikini.

384
00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:53.800
-What are you doing?

385
00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:56.302
-A hospital is a terrible
place to be if you're sick.

386
00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:57.636
I mean. there are germs
in the hospital

387
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.906
that you can't get
anywhere else.

388
00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:02.408
If the germs don't get you.
the food will.

389
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.944
So. I'm staying.

390
00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:08.347
Besides. this is our honeymoon.

391
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:20.292
-Come in.

392
00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:23.729
-You've got visitors.

393
00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:27.934
-Ooh. So you are
rock solid. sweetheart.

394
00:29:27.967 --> 00:29:31.904
Oh. Twenty nodes out.
all negative.

395
00:29:31.938 --> 00:29:34.473
-I know.
-That is so impressive.

396
00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:38.244
Now. Kent and Kati and I went
Christmas shopping near Max's.

397
00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:40.679
but we didn't find
a thing for you.

398
00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.414
-Thanks. Mom.

399
00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:44.283
-We are busting you
outta here tomorrow.

400
00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:45.751
-I can't wait!

401
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.719
I'm so excited!
-Me too. I missed you.

402
00:29:47.753 --> 00:29:48.821
-I missed you.
-

403
00:29:48.855 --> 00:29:51.623
-Come home for Christmas.

404
00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:52.791
-We have cookies ready...

405
00:29:52.825 --> 00:29:54.560
-Presents.
-Yep.

406
00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:57.629
-Oh. you're gonna get
so many presents.

407
00:29:57.663 --> 00:29:59.498
-Oh. my favorite.
- Oh.

408
00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:41.000
-Since your tumor
was estrogen positive.

409
00:31:41.033 --> 00:31:43.835
the--the hormonal shifts
with being pregnant

410
00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:48.574
would be like fertilizer
for any remaining cells.

411
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:51.510
I think it's an amazing sign
that you're--

412
00:31:51.543 --> 00:31:54.446
that you're pregnant. Terry.
I do.

413
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.416
And if. if you're free of this
in two years.

414
00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:01.020
you can get pregnant again.

415
00:32:01.053 --> 00:32:03.089
-So we'll wait.

416
00:32:03.122 --> 00:32:05.757
Hey. we'll do it again.

417
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:06.925
And you're a healthy girl

418
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:08.995
and we're gonna start
a big fucking family.

419
00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:19.038
Thanks. Doc.

420
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:20.172
Of course.

421
00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:33.119
Sorry
I haven't written in so long.

422
00:32:33.152 --> 00:32:36.722
The big news now is that
we're moving to Lake Tahoe.

423
00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:41.627
It all came about because
I accidentally got pregnant.

424
00:32:43.062 --> 00:32:45.497
I cried for a week.

425
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:49.668
It made me realize how much
I really want Ken's child.

426
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.670
Kids love Ken.

427
00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:52.904
He says it's because

428
00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:55.007
he's the same emotional age
as they are.

429
00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.012
We'll be clear
in two years though.

430
00:33:00.046 --> 00:33:01.713
Honey. are you ready?

431
00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:05.517
I told the magazine
I'd fax your interview today.

432
00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:06.685
When we met.

433
00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:10.189
he owned one desk chair.
a typewriter ...

434
00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:12.191
Okay. Mr. Wilber.

435
00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:13.792
... and 4.000 books.

436
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.461
Why don't you start
by explaining

437
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:18.564
what you mean by
the "perennial philosophy"?

438
00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:21.233
Okay. well.
the human body. for example.

439
00:33:21.267 --> 00:33:23.802
has 208 bones.
one heart and two kidneys.

440
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.004
whether it appears in
Mozambique or Manhattan.

441
00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:27.806
whether today
or a thousand years ago.

442
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.176
These we call "deep structures."

443
00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:35.847
Well. just as the human body
universally grows hair.

444
00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:38.684
the human mind
universally grows ideas.

445
00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:41.987
and the human spirit
universally grows intuitions.

446
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.490
-It's hard to see
what many religions.

447
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:48.094
like Buddhism and Christianity.
for instance. might agree on.

448
00:33:48.127 --> 00:33:50.496
-Mm. We charge extra
for that.

449
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:53.665
-Oh. come on.
Give me six points.

450
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:58.504
-All right. One. spirit exists.
Two. it resides within.

451
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.606
Three. most of us
don't realize this

452
00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:03.041
because we're living in
an illusory state of separation.

453
00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:06.078
Four. there is a path
out of this state.

454
00:34:06.112 --> 00:34:09.681
Five. if you follow this path.
the result is transcendence.

455
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:13.752
which. six.
marks the end of suffering.

456
00:34:15.654 --> 00:34:16.755
Now take your pants off.

457
00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:18.890
-Mr. Wilber!

458
00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:24.062
Okay. so you're saying
that spirit exists within?

459
00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:25.063
-Yes.

460
00:34:26.332 --> 00:34:29.301
And it's found by
consistently looking within

461
00:34:29.335 --> 00:34:34.072
until within becomes beyond.

462
00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.274
-Within. huh?

463
00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:45.151
Okay. so for the grand prize.

464
00:34:55.661 --> 00:35:01.133
-So by looking at my mind.
I eventually transcend the mind?

465
00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:02.268
-Exactly.

466
00:35:06.805 --> 00:35:08.140
-You wanna get something to eat?

467
00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:13.812
Or I could make spaghetti again.

468
00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.647
I'm trying to transcend.

469
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:20.118
I'm starving.
Transcendence can wait.

470
00:35:27.826 --> 00:35:29.828
Hello. Dr. Richard's office.

471
00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:31.697
-Hi. This is
Terry Killam Wilber.

472
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.365
Can I please speak to
Dr. Richards. please?

473
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.100
Of course. one second.

474
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.067
Hey. Terry.

475
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:38.136
It's Dr. Richards.

476
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.607
Listen. we got the results
of your test back today.

477
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.342
Look. I'm really sorry
to say this.

478
00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.712
It's--it's an unusual
kind of recurrence.

479
00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:49.381
But I don't want you to worry.
We can take care of this.

480
00:35:49.415 --> 00:35:50.949
So. when can you come back in?

481
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.150
-Uh. I can be there tomorrow.

482
00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:56.922
Okay. Thank you.

483
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.694
If it is. it is.

484
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.802
Hello. how are you doing?

485
00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:11.870
-Good.

486
00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.038
Comfortable?

487
00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:14.072
-Yeah.

488
00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.006
Good.

489
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:21.146
So. when I remove
your right breast today.

490
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.281
Dr. Harvey will be reducing

491
00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:24.750
the size of your left.
-Yeah.

492
00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:28.820
-See. some of the cells
got caught on the drainage tube.

493
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:31.122
And so when we took that out.
they got caught on the skin

494
00:36:31.156 --> 00:36:32.858
and were left behind.

495
00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:35.227
And I promise you. we will
get them all today. Terry.

496
00:36:35.261 --> 00:36:36.161
Okay.

497
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.465
-Okay.

498
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.869
There.

499
00:36:43.902 --> 00:36:46.738
All right. so we're gonna
have to move your nipple up.

500
00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:48.240
But we can do this without
severing the connection

501
00:36:48.274 --> 00:36:49.841
with the milk ducts.

502
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.843
So that way.
the breast stays functional

503
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.880
and if you ever decide
you want to have a child.

504
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.354
-Okay. Eighty-three.
All right?

505
00:37:02.388 --> 00:37:04.122
If you don't mind.
can you just stand up here?

506
00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.757
I'm just gonna--
- Uh. yeah.

507
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:06.825
Unfortunately.
I'm gonna have to draw on you

508
00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:08.193
a little bit.
-That's okay.

509
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:15.467
-Hey. come in. come in.
-Hi.

510
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.774
Um. hi. sweetie. is it--

511
00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:23.875
is this all right?

512
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:24.976
It's fine. Mom.

513
00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:27.913
It's okay.
Come. and I'll show you.

514
00:37:31.517 --> 00:37:33.184
-I'll be right back. baby.

515
00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:34.453
Okay. sweetheart.

516
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:46.425
-I mean.
you're like such a stud!

517
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:48.960
Total stud.

518
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.195
No.
-Yes.

519
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.066
-Look.
it's been with us a year.

520
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.135
as long as we've been married.

521
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:04.543
The program's straightforward:
diet... megavitamins...

522
00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:06.445
...

523
00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:09.280
sexercise!

524
00:39:09.314 --> 00:39:11.016
-More sexercise.

525
00:39:13.485 --> 00:39:16.054
I think I was more upset
about your boob than you were.

526
00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:19.190
-Yeah. well.
it was worth it.

527
00:39:19.224 --> 00:39:20.158
-Yeah.

528
00:39:21.427 --> 00:39:24.295
-The doctors seem unanimous.

529
00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:25.263
-Biggest stud I know.

530
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.033
-I love you. Kati.

531
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:29.334
-I love you.

532
00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:49.220
Hello?

533
00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:50.321
Yes.

534
00:39:55.293 --> 00:39:56.394
Mm-hm.

535
00:39:59.364 --> 00:40:00.331
I see.

536
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:06.572
Okay. thank you.

537
00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:22.488
-What?

538
00:40:26.525 --> 00:40:32.664
Look. I'm barely stage two.
estrogen positive. clean nodes.

539
00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:37.503
-The opinions were divided.

540
00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.441
-Just fucking
tell me straight. Ken!

541
00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:49.214
-Recurrence within a year.

542
00:40:49.247 --> 00:40:53.952
Recurrence in a radiated area.
Estrogen negative.

543
00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:55.453
Grade four. stage four.

544
00:41:11.637 --> 00:41:15.974
No.

545
00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:17.408
I don't want it.

546
00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:20.045
Please. No.

547
00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:26.985
-Listen. listen.

548
00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:28.687
What does this decision
all hinge on?

549
00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:34.025
-Intellect isn't going to
save the day now. Ken.

550
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.105
Okay. What?

551
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.644
-The pathology report.
Dr. Lagios.

552
00:41:52.678 --> 00:41:54.479
He's the one that's been
staring down the microscope

553
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:56.615
at your cells.
and it's his report

554
00:41:56.648 --> 00:41:58.584
that these doctors
are trying to interpret.

555
00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:06.157
You want me to call or you?

556
00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.799
-Doctors listen to men.
You call.

557
00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:26.778
-Dr. Lagios. please.

558
00:42:26.812 --> 00:42:28.714
It's Ken Wilber. It's urgent.

559
00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:37.689
Dr. Lagios.
I know this is unusual.

560
00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:41.126
but Terry and I have some
difficult decisions to make.

561
00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.428
and I was wondering if I can
just talk to you for a minute.

562
00:42:46.698 --> 00:42:48.734
Dr. Lagios.
our doctors are divided

563
00:42:48.767 --> 00:42:52.337
as to whether Terry's recurrence
was local or metastatic.

564
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.471
I just want to know

565
00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.506
how aggressive
the cells look to you.

566
00:42:56.742 --> 00:42:57.743
Please.

567
00:43:08.687 --> 00:43:11.056
Tell me. Dr. Lagios.

568
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:13.424
If this was your wife.
would you recommend chemo?

569
00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:18.396
And the odds?

570
00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:52.764
-Whfff.

571
00:43:55.767 --> 00:43:59.137
Suicide sounds nice
right about now.

572
00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:04.342
-The Reglan's hitting you hard.

573
00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.244
You're having
a bad histamine reaction.

574
00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:07.879
Just hold on
for the Benadryl. okay?

575
00:44:07.913 --> 00:44:09.314
Could you start the Benadryl?

576
00:44:12.684 --> 00:44:13.752
Hang in there.

577
00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:15.153
We'll be back at the hotel
in no time. okay?

578
00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:26.364
You got this.
You got this.

579
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.552
-Are you okay?

580
00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:49.254
-Yeah. Keep reading to me.

581
00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:57.863
The witness exercise from
No Boundary . would you?

582
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:09.174
-"I have a body.
but I am not my body.

583
00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:11.442
"My body may be
tired or excited.

584
00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:14.679
"sick or healthy.
anxious or calm.

585
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:18.683
"but that has nothing to do
with my inward I.

586
00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:22.420
"I have emotions.
but I am not my emotions.

587
00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:24.555
Emotions pass through me."

588
00:45:27.258 --> 00:45:33.431
It really helps.
it just doesn't last.

589
00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:36.634
I feel like I'm crawling
out of my skin.

590
00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.371
Suicide sounds sensible.

591
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.672
Oh. god. Hm.

592
00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:42.774
-Nietzche used to say

593
00:45:42.808 --> 00:45:44.342
that the only way
he got to sleep at night

594
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:46.945
was by promising to kill himself
in the morning.

595
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:54.552
-Okay. Read me more.

596
00:45:57.856 --> 00:46:01.559
The part about the...
the witness being immortal.

597
00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:06.397
-Sure.

598
00:46:06.431 --> 00:46:08.299
"Perhaps you.
like most people.

599
00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:09.667
"feel that you are

600
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.470
"basically the same person
you were yesterday.

601
00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.372
"You probably also feel
that you are fundamentally

602
00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:17.708
"the same person
you were a year ago.

603
00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:20.812
"Put another way: you never
remember a time

604
00:46:20.846 --> 00:46:23.281
"when you weren't you.

605
00:46:23.314 --> 00:46:24.850
"In other words.
something in you

606
00:46:24.883 --> 00:46:28.820
"seems to remain untouched
by the passage of time.

607
00:46:28.854 --> 00:46:31.990
"Your mind. your body.
your feelings.

608
00:46:32.023 --> 00:46:34.960
"all have changed with time.

609
00:46:34.993 --> 00:46:39.397
"But you know that
something has not changed.

610
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.466
Something feels the same."

611
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.776
Chemo
is based on a single principle:

612
00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:55.746
cancer cells divide and grow
twice as fast as healthy cells.

613
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:00.385
The idea is to kill
some healthy cells.

614
00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:03.288
but many more bad cells.

615
00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:04.923
At the end of
a successful round.

616
00:47:04.956 --> 00:47:07.893
the tumor is dead
and the patient only half-dead.

617
00:47:10.028 --> 00:47:12.830
Ken and I stood in front of
the mirror together.

618
00:47:12.864 --> 00:47:15.766
staring at the odd sight
of the both of us.

619
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.303
just laughing.

620
00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:20.471
Ken's been
unbelievably supportive.

621
00:47:20.505 --> 00:47:23.942
and that he keeps me laughing
has saved my life.

622
00:47:23.975 --> 00:47:26.377
When I first shaved my head.

623
00:47:26.411 --> 00:47:30.715
he told me I'm the sexiest woman
he's ever been with.

624
00:47:30.748 --> 00:47:32.884
And then he told me he likes
my head so much this way

625
00:47:32.918 --> 00:47:34.019
that after it grows back.

626
00:47:34.052 --> 00:47:36.922
he wants me to shave it again.

627
00:47:36.955 --> 00:47:38.556
Linda Conger
came up to Tahoe

628
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.491
to photograph us together.

629
00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:43.461
During the shoot.
Ken put on my breast prosthesis

630
00:47:43.494 --> 00:47:45.430
and suggested
Linda shoot us nude

631
00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:47.632
from the waist up.

632
00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:52.770
My god. the three of us
laughed so hard we cried.

633
00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:55.773
That's kinda how it is
with cancer. I guess.

634
00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:59.844
cry till you laugh
and laugh till you cry.

635
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.580
"The rough
parts were losing my period.

636
00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:07.885
"mouth sores. painful bowel.
blood sometimes.

637
00:48:07.919 --> 00:48:11.022
"But it's amazing what
human beings can endure.

638
00:48:11.056 --> 00:48:12.423
"And Kristen and I
hosting the group

639
00:48:12.457 --> 00:48:13.858
"from the Wellness Center...

640
00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:16.527
I was so inspired
by the stories."

641
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:19.430
After that.
it started to get tough.

642
00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:21.933
Ken hasn't written in forever.

643
00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:24.469
He's given up his life
to care for me.

644
00:48:24.502 --> 00:48:27.939
all day. all night.
every day and night.

645
00:48:27.973 --> 00:48:30.741
Since right when
we got married.

646
00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:31.943
" One night.
a good friend of mine

647
00:48:31.977 --> 00:48:35.113
"called to ask for
some insight about cancer.

648
00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:37.748
"She called for Ken
and didn't even ask me.

649
00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:39.684
"I defended.
and then it spiraled.

650
00:48:43.154 --> 00:48:44.589
"We've been getting
counseling support

651
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:46.924
"visiting Frances and Roger.

652
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:50.161
though many days it just seems
like it can't work."

653
00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.834
God.
it'll be almost two years.

654
00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:01.539
With Ken's love. I've managed
treatments pretty well.

655
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.409
What caught us from behind

656
00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:08.646
is the emotional and
psychological devastation.

657
00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.616
And I don't think Ken can
endure living only for me

658
00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:13.818
without living for himself.

659
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.456
On top of it all.
since moving to Tahoe.

660
00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:21.459
Ken seems to have caught
some sort of strange bug

661
00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:22.860
no one can identify.

662
00:49:25.063 --> 00:49:26.664
And on top of that.

663
00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:30.101
I can't seem to help
being defensive. even grating.

664
00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:34.105
and Ken's dropped
into depression.

665
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.578
Better news soon.
but always with love. Treya.

666
00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:47.985
-Hi.

667
00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:49.087
Hi.

668
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.255
-Thank you for coming.

669
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:52.857
-Such a pleasure to be here.

670
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.460
I-I-I am a huge fan
of your work.

671
00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:58.596
I can't tell you how much
your books have affected me.

672
00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:00.265
-Great. thanks.
Come on in.

673
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.869
So Ken.
what are you working on now?

674
00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:06.037
I haven't really

675
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:07.605
done any extended
writing for some time.

676
00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:12.910
Just not coming anymore.

677
00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.944
That period is over.

678
00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:18.183
-Wow.

679
00:50:20.518 --> 00:50:22.520
What it must be like
to be called

680
00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:25.823
the greatest philosopher
of consciousness since Freud.

681
00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.024
and feel it evaporating.

682
00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:33.064
-More fun than a human
should be allowed to have.

683
00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:08.959
-The greater the love.
the greater the pain.

684
00:52:08.993 --> 00:52:11.095
The greater the love.
the greater the pain.

685
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.631
The greater the love.
the greater the pain.

686
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.067
"He has no enemies.

687
00:52:17.101 --> 00:52:19.404
He's just intensely disliked
by all his friends."

688
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:57.875
Flatline

689
00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:01.879
It's check out time.

690
00:53:36.247 --> 00:53:38.115
-Can you do that in
the other room. please?

691
00:53:44.255 --> 00:53:46.957
-I like to read
the paper here.

692
00:53:46.991 --> 00:53:51.128
It's my favorite place for that.
I look forward to it.

693
00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.305
-Look. this is my office.

694
00:54:00.338 --> 00:54:03.708
All three other rooms
are dedicated to your needs.

695
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:07.111
Including an office.
So. find one.

696
00:54:07.144 --> 00:54:08.178
-No.

697
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:24.194
-This is the only thing
I have left for myself.

698
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.932
It's not a lot to ask.

699
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.502
-You know. it's really
aggravating when you're snide.

700
00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.238
I'm reading here.

701
00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:41.546
-Get out.

702
00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:44.949
-No!

703
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:48.353
-What the fuck else can I do!

704
00:54:48.386 --> 00:54:49.887
Get out!

705
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.356
-Get out yourself!

706
00:54:51.389 --> 00:54:53.391
-You goddamn obnoxious bitch!

707
00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:55.393
-Fuck you. Ken. Fuck you!

708
00:54:55.426 --> 00:54:59.330
Get. get off me!

709
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.032
I don't know what you want!

710
00:55:02.066 --> 00:55:03.100
Fuck you!

711
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.448
-I'm leaving.

712
00:55:17.482 --> 00:55:19.850
I'm going to San Francisco.

713
00:55:19.884 --> 00:55:22.820
I hate what we're doing.
You can come or you can--

714
00:55:22.853 --> 00:55:23.988
-Leave.

715
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.425
Ah. just leave.

716
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.823
Hi. honey. it's Mom.

717
00:55:58.856 --> 00:56:03.027
You know what we think of Ken.
I don't mean that.

718
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.029
We just don't agree
with what he writes.

719
00:56:05.062 --> 00:56:07.097
That's all.

720
00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:11.101
Any man would be
so lucky to have you.

721
00:56:12.937 --> 00:56:14.304
Hi. Terry. It's Vicky.

722
00:56:14.338 --> 00:56:15.573
Pick up if you're there.

723
00:56:17.475 --> 00:56:18.342
So you call me

724
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:21.579
if you need anything.

725
00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:23.047
I love you.

726
00:56:31.556 --> 00:56:32.890
Hi. Terry. It's Vicki.

727
00:56:32.923 --> 00:56:33.991
Pick up if you're there.

728
00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:34.925
You call me

729
00:56:34.959 --> 00:56:37.595
if you need anything.

730
00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:39.329
I love you.

731
00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:41.966
Hi. Terry. It's Vicki.

732
00:56:41.999 --> 00:56:43.400
Pick up if you're there.

733
00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:46.370
Ken called.
He's in San Francisco.

734
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.473
He's getting help.

735
00:56:48.506 --> 00:56:51.241
I thought you should know.

736
00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:54.344
I want to be supportive.

737
00:56:54.378 --> 00:56:56.981
You deserve each other. Terry.

738
00:56:58.683 --> 00:57:01.018
I know you're listening.

739
00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:01.952
I love you.

740
00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.694
-I have to let go...

741
00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:15.132
I have to let go. to hold on.

742
00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:19.670
My husband.

743
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:31.682
-My wife.

744
00:58:25.703 --> 00:58:28.072
-"Treya..."

745
00:58:28.105 --> 00:58:29.039
My dearest.

746
00:58:29.073 --> 00:58:32.376
-"My dearest. I am sorry."

747
00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:33.310
I'm sorry.

748
00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:37.414
-"I've searched
a thousand lifetimes

749
00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:44.421
"to find you.
and I can't let you go. I won't.

750
00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:46.290
"Not now. not ever.

751
00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:51.461
"Not in this lifetime.
or any other.

752
00:58:51.495 --> 00:58:54.264
"I love you with all of my soul.

753
00:58:54.298 --> 00:58:56.033
Please come back to me.
my love..."

754
00:58:56.066 --> 00:58:58.135
Please. come back to me.

755
00:58:58.168 --> 00:58:59.203
-My soul.

756
00:58:59.236 --> 00:59:00.270
My soul.

757
00:59:03.107 --> 00:59:05.009
-"I'm coming to
get you tomorrow."

758
00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:10.047
"You and me. Forever.

759
00:59:11.749 --> 00:59:13.117
It's all I know."

760
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.822
It's all I'm gonna do.

761
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.508
-Hello.

762
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.210
Hello. Mr. Wilber.

763
01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.311
-Yeah.

764
01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.545
My name is Edith Zundel.

765
01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:17.381
from West Germany.

766
01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:20.084
I'm doing a book of interviews
with avant-garde psychologists

767
01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.319
and I'd really
like to interview you.

768
01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:25.222
-I appreciate that. Edith.
but I-I don't do interviews.

769
01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:26.657
I'm staying
with Frances Vaughan

770
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:29.526
and Roger Walsh.
I've come a long way

771
01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.128
and would really like to
talk with you.

772
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.130
Please.
-

773
01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:34.865
-Here's the thing. Edith.

774
01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:37.534
Most authors end up
appearing as teachers

775
01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:40.237
when they do interviews.
and it's just not me.

776
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.439
I can appreciate that.
Mr. Wilber.

777
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.876
I know you've only given
four interviews in 15 years.

778
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.345
Your synthesis of Eastern
and Western psychologies

779
01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.681
has had a major impact.

780
01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:54.618
It would just be a few
questions. as a scholar.

781
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.521
All ten of your books have been
hugely popular in Germany.

782
01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.656
I even have copies in Japanese.

783
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:03.127
-Oh. the two peaceful countries.

784
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.228
Frances and Roger

785
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:07.932
told me about Terry.
I'm very sorry.

786
01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.870
-Okay. Edith. come on over
this afternoon.

787
01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.442
Babe!

788
01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.145
My period returned.

789
01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.487
Maybe I can have your child
after all.

790
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.455
Yes. baby.

791
01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:36.693
-I think Frances and Roger
were right.

792
01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:41.832
It doesn't matter what we say
as... much as how we say it.

793
01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:48.572
Hm. Yeah.
Please... clean the car.

794
01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:52.276
Clean the house. and...
see me in the bedroom.

795
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:53.577
-You can see more of me

796
01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:55.645
walking away to go garden.
mister.

797
01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:12.963
Chris is the only one here

798
01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.800
who works like this.
But she's vastly popular.

799
01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.371
-Bill has an inoperable
brain tumor.

800
01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.841
I'm working on containing
and shrinking it.

801
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.611
Bill came here on a gurney

802
01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:30.380
from the hospital last week
with two tumors

803
01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.648
which Chris shrank.

804
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.883
But one grew back.

805
01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.389
I would love to meet Ken later.

806
01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.993
Up From Eden was incredible.
I'm a fan.

807
01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:47.564
-Okay. Bill. Off you go.

808
01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.968
I feel the cold spot's gone.
You're good for today.

809
01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.469
Thanks.

810
01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.437
-Treya?

811
01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:06.851
Oh. Hm. Cool here.

812
01:03:08.853 --> 01:03:12.256
Make sure you tell me if you
feel any really cold spots.

813
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.358
-Cool there.

814
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:15.960
-There's something going on
in the pancreas.

815
01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:19.363
-Oh. I forgot to tell you.
I have diabetes.

816
01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.765
-Cancer is caused by a virus...

817
01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:25.369
and that virus
may still be here. hiding.

818
01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:28.906
even though medical doctors
say it's gone.

819
01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:33.878
What I'm doing now
is keeping it from moving.

820
01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:36.413
I had cancer when I was 23.

821
01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:39.683
It led me to all kinds
of doctors and healers.

822
01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:42.652
I was arrested once for healing
a child with leukemia.

823
01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:45.789
Can you imagine that?
Like that's a crime.

824
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.358
It is about raising vibrations.

825
01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:52.762
But it's also mathematical
and totally teachable.

826
01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:55.832
My dream is to go
into a Third World country

827
01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:58.435
and teach others how to heal.

828
01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.004
But that's not allowed
in the US.

829
01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:03.807
-Hi. there.

830
01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:08.745
-Ken Wilber.
It's a pleasure.

831
01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.780
-Pleasure.

832
01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:13.583
-Do you want to give it a go?
It's perfect timing.

833
01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:16.586
and you'll both know
the method for later.

834
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.621
-Sounds great.

835
01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:22.359
We've been looking forward
to meeting you. Chris.

836
01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:32.469
Okay. Okay.

837
01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:33.703
Okay.

838
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.642
I feel no coldness anywhere.

839
01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:41.478
You?

840
01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.546
-Nope.

841
01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.852
-Very interesting.

842
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:52.689
So. there are ten channels
on each side of the brain.

843
01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.992
For most people. two or three
sides are opened up.

844
01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.994
Four at the most.

845
01:04:57.027 --> 01:05:01.731
In my brain. all ten channels
on both sides are open to ten.

846
01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.667
I mean. this kind of thing
doesn't happen

847
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.470
but every 2.000 years.

848
01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:09.539
The last person before me
was the Buddha.

849
01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:13.143
But. Ken. you are open
on one side of your brain to ten

850
01:05:13.177 --> 01:05:17.514
and the other side is seven.

851
01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.552
Holy crap.

852
01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:24.521
I really think
that I can open the seven side

853
01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:27.891
all the way up. All the way.

854
01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:32.462
Okay. tell me if you smell
anything strange.

855
01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:34.431
Uh. I smell smoke.

856
01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.566
-Good. Good.

857
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.602
-Now I smell mildew.

858
01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.707
Oh. man.

859
01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:46.443
-Both sides are open up to ten.

860
01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:52.182
I'm blown away. Wow.
I mean. so much for the theory

861
01:05:52.216 --> 01:05:55.652
that this only happens to
one person every 2.000 years.

862
01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:58.822
I can't believe it.
It's amazing.

863
01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.624
Now there are
two people

864
01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:02.126
right here in this room.

865
01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.427
Oh. my god.

866
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.031
It's so crazy.

867
01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:12.036
Cheers to that.

868
01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.007
-To Terry's
clean bill of health.

869
01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.145
Since a removed
port-a-cath means

870
01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:26.016
they think the possibility
of another occurrence is slim.

871
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:30.120
Another tequila for everyone.
-

872
01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:31.755
-Trey.

873
01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.457
-Thank you.

874
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.458
-Thank you.

875
01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.026
-Cheers!
-

876
01:06:54.278 --> 01:06:56.780
Happy birthday.

877
01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:01.818
Oh. we love you.

878
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.988
Thank you.

879
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.926
-Make a wish.
You make a wish.

880
01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.040
-"Important voice."
I think it said.

881
01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.742
-I know. it does.
-Mm-hm.

882
01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:47.597
Vicky! Uh-huh.

883
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:49.999
For CSC?

884
01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:54.003
A 25.000-dollar grant!

885
01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:58.708
Oh. Vicky. Oh. Vicky.
Yes. Yes!

886
01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:00.877
Okay. okay.

887
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.613
All right.
I'll call you back.

888
01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:06.350
Oh.

889
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:25.769
Eight hundred pages
in a month and a half.

890
01:08:25.802 --> 01:08:26.936
Ken Wilber.

891
01:08:32.976 --> 01:08:34.744
-Must be the new house.

892
01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.380
-Yeah. mister... must be.

893
01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.151
-She had a bone scan
three months ago?

894
01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:44.954
Yeah. it was clear.
So just a high-density CAT scan

895
01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.192
to see what might be causing
the slight waviness in her eye.

896
01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:49.359
-Great.

897
01:08:51.195 --> 01:08:52.862
You can wait down the hall.
- All right.

898
01:08:52.896 --> 01:08:55.865
The doctor should be
with you shortly.

899
01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:08.111
Mr. Wilber?

900
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.120
It looks like there are two
or three tumors in her brain.

901
01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:25.895
One is very large...

902
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:33.803
perhaps three centimeters.

903
01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:39.876
So we just scanned
her lungs as well.

904
01:09:44.047 --> 01:09:45.014
-Um.

905
01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:56.693
-She has multiple tumors
throughout both lungs...

906
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:07.704
possibly a dozen altogether.

907
01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:15.078
I'm as shocked by this
as you are.

908
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:16.713
I think the best thing to do

909
01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:22.118
would be to tell her in my
office tomorrow morning. Please.

910
01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.720
I think
the best thing to do

911
01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:28.392
would be to tell her in my
office tomorrow morning. Please.

912
01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.793
I want to have
all the information

913
01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:31.761
ready for her beforehand.

914
01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.101
-Yeah. Right. Of course.

915
01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:54.851
* We rattle a gateless gate

916
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.226
* And push against
A weightless weight *

917
01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:12.001
* Looking for
A stateless state *

918
01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:14.270
-I don't think it's anything.

919
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.839
I feel clear.

920
01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.173
-* Nicola

921
01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:19.108
-It's probably
related to blood sugar.

922
01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:22.446
-* Whatever love creates

923
01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:24.314
-We're gonna have
a great life together. babe.

924
01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:26.082
You don't have to look
so worried.

925
01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.453
-Right. No. Of course.
Definitely.

926
01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:33.222
-* And all these twins

927
01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:35.325
* With different faces
- * With different faces

928
01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:40.464
-* Fallen from the womb
- * Fallen from the womb

929
01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:46.202
-* Risen from the tomb
- * Risen from the tomb

930
01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.138
-* Carried in perfume
- * Carried in perfume

931
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.477
-* Nicola
- * Nicola

932
01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:14.330
-* All the ones alive today

933
01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:18.835
No. No!
No. no. no.

934
01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.438
I don't give a fuck!
Damn it. damn it!

935
01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:24.974
-* Are the ones
That passed away *

936
01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:28.945
-No! It's not fair!
It's not fucking fair!

937
01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:32.081
-* Are the ones on the way

938
01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:36.386
And I could see it
written on your face.

939
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.023
-* Nicola
-No! Please!

940
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.137
I don't understand.

941
01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.473
I don't understand.

942
01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:01.945
Please. Please. Please.

943
01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:05.048
Please. No. No. No. No

944
01:13:10.353 --> 01:13:13.322
But I want to have your baby.

945
01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:17.060
that's all.

946
01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.896
Please. please. please.

947
01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:24.901
No.

948
01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:37.547
However you wanna do it...
whatever you want.

949
01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:52.929
Janker Klinik.

950
01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.900
-Is that your choice?

951
01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:00.504
Short-term. high-dose.
Germany.

952
01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:02.271
-So aggressive people

953
01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:06.242
sometimes have to be put
on life support.

954
01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:12.081
But Bob Marley. Yul Brynner.
70 percent remission rate.

955
01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:22.358
I want to go.
I want to try this.

956
01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:48.117
-Would you recommend
this particular treatment

957
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:50.286
for your wife?

958
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.589
Never ask a doctor

959
01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:55.625
if he recommends
the treatment for his wife.

960
01:14:55.659 --> 01:14:58.562
You don't know
how they get along!

961
01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:01.197
No. you best ask.

962
01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.534
would he recommend this
for his daughter.

963
01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.705
-Well. for your daughter?

964
01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:13.543
We do not do
long-term treatments.

965
01:15:13.577 --> 01:15:16.312
as is common in America.

966
01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:22.586
Now we-we find that it lowers
the quality of life.

967
01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:24.721
We must always remember that--

968
01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:31.427
that surrounding this tumor
is a human being.

969
01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:35.198
And also-- it also
damages the soul.

970
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:39.135
This is high-dose. short-term.
We knock it out.

971
01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:41.771
Your white blood cell count
will drop.

972
01:15:41.805 --> 01:15:44.240
And then they will rise again
to 1.500.

973
01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.309
And then you can
leave the hospital at

974
01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:49.545
at 1.800.
You can take a trip.

975
01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:54.350
And when it's back up to 2.500.
we can begin the next treatment.

976
01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.595
It's two Kolsch for five marks.

977
01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:11.835
Dr. Scheef installed it.

978
01:16:13.837 --> 01:16:17.073
He drinks 10 or 15 a day.

979
01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:19.308
-Really. Hmm.

980
01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:23.212
-He says it's the only alcohol
that puts more into your system

981
01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.215
than it takes out.

982
01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.084
-Really?
-Hm.

983
01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:29.653
Dr. Scheef told me
about your books.

984
01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:31.587
He says you're famous.

985
01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:34.357
-Really?

986
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:37.226
-You know. he's amazing.

987
01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.464
There was a German woman.
severe ovarian cancer.

988
01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:44.300
She wanted to
go visit her son in LA.

989
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.202
but she didn't have
money nor a visa.

990
01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.404
And I heard Scheef.
he surprised her with both

991
01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.174
for a gift
for finishing treatment.

992
01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.309
-Really?

993
01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.377
-Really.

994
01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.698
Treya was running the risk

995
01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:18.134
of catching pneumonia.
though she went from 103.6

996
01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:20.737
to just under a hundred
this morning.

997
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.806
And Dr. Scheef thinks
the radiation and sulfamide

998
01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:25.274
are helping. So...

999
01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:27.510
looks like we're starting
a specialized chemo treatment

1000
01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:30.279
on Monday.

1001
01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:33.649
Treya. still amazing
at every turn.

1002
01:17:41.557 --> 01:17:45.361
-Okay. I think
I'm ready for lunch.

1003
01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.496
Dear loved ones.

1004
01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.433
I can't thank you enough
for your letters and calls.

1005
01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:57.440
It feels wonderful. like
floating in a caressing ocean.

1006
01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:58.507
And Ken has been the best

1007
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:01.277
support person.
It's unappreciated.

1008
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.880
and yet he's vibrant.
with dedication and humor.

1009
01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.581
He's half of my soul.

1010
01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:06.883
God. I love this man.

1011
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.855
He holds my hand.
makes me laugh.

1012
01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:15.792
runs errands.
picks out fresh vegetables.

1013
01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:21.364
Kati was just here for ten days.

1014
01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:22.866
-Wow. she's an amazing listener.

1015
01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:26.302
Mom and Dad
have been so supportive.

1016
01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.205
And Ken's parents
who are so loving.

1017
01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.441
my friends in Colorado.
at the CSC.

1018
01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:36.712
my Findhorn friends...
and my sweet Vicky.

1019
01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:40.750
-And I have complete faith
in Herr Dr. Professor Scheef

1020
01:18:40.784 --> 01:18:43.887
who runs the Janker Klinik.

1021
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.554
The drug he's using.
which he developed.

1022
01:18:45.588 --> 01:18:46.956
only just got approved
in the US

1023
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.392
because it's so potent.

1024
01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:52.628
I can't say how much easier
it is though.

1025
01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:53.963
-I've moved through a lot.

1026
01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.698
From intense anger and crying.

1027
01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:59.702
to thoughts of death and fears
of what pain may come.

1028
01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.571
-Then to thoughts of all those
suffering on this planet.

1029
01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.808
and then I feel
a wave of calmness.

1030
01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:07.243
A feeling
of not being alone in it.

1031
01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:09.678
and some sort of
greater connection.

1032
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.817
-I read an article
in the New York Times yesterday

1033
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.452
on a study by Dr. Sandra Levy.

1034
01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:19.455
She found that
for the survival rate of women

1035
01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.825
who had had advanced
breast cancer.

1036
01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:25.661
the only psychological factor
that seemed to matter

1037
01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.497
was sense of joy in life.

1038
01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:36.272
That first noble truth:
there is suffering in the world.

1039
01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.773
To take part in it

1040
01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:40.509
feels like I'm engaged on
a special journey.

1041
01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:43.779
only taken up by those
who can handle it.

1042
01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:47.616
I call it passionate equanimity.

1043
01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:52.588
I do all I can. but without
attachment to the results.

1044
01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.423
Just for the love of it.

1045
01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:55.424
Just for the love of it.

1046
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:56.792
-The love of life.

1047
01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:57.927
The love of life.

1048
01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:07.036
-Hey. Norbert.
Yeah. I'm up in the room.

1049
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:09.738
Am I missing any action
at the front desk?

1050
01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:13.409
No. no. um. maybe
just some towels.

1051
01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.578
Yeah. she's recovering
from the second.

1052
01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:16.712
It's a lung infection.

1053
01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:19.415
so I've had to stay away
while her counts are low.

1054
01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:20.649
Mm-hm.

1055
01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:22.051
Yeah. I'm journaling.
you know her.

1056
01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.756
Yeah. I can't believe it.
It's almost four months.

1057
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:29.658
Listen. uh. I'm going to
go out for a while.

1058
01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:34.330
in case she calls. I just.
I just need to get some air.

1059
01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:35.664
Yeah. thanks.

1060
01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:49.712
-Ken!

1061
01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:59.755
No more drinking for you.
You have to be strong.

1062
01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:00.890
I don't want
to be strong. Norbert.

1063
01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:05.461
I want to be weak and spineless
for a while.

1064
01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.597
Ken.

1065
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:09.532
-Suits me better.

1066
01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:11.800
Ken.

1067
01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:24.080
Men and women
were once whole.

1068
01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:25.714
but were torn in two.

1069
01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:28.384
Men and women were once whole
but were torn in two.

1070
01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:31.420
and the pursuit and desire
of that whole.

1071
01:21:31.454 --> 01:21:33.856
And the pursuit and desire
of that whole is called love.

1072
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.658
Is called love.

1073
01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:47.616
I think I had a dream.
I was looking for you.

1074
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.986
There was a mountain.

1075
01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:54.757
And an ocean.

1076
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:57.293
And millions of stars.

1077
01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:02.998
Where were you?

1078
01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:09.705
Here.

1079
01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:11.874
And am I ever glad
you're here too.

1080
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.213
You always promised
you'd find me. you know.

1081
01:25:21.984 --> 01:25:25.221
Maybe we're
in each other's dream.

1082
01:25:25.254 --> 01:25:26.389
Is that possible?

1083
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.295
Give me your hand.

1084
01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:47.676
"Sam. I'm only
updating you because you said

1085
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.246
"otherwise you wouldn't
publish my next book

1086
01:25:50.279 --> 01:25:52.881
in the event I ever write one."

1087
01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:53.949
We've
tried all the treatments

1088
01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.051
sane men have come up with.

1089
01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.854
None of them have worked.
so we've settled on

1090
01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:01.324
the Kelly/Gonzales
enzyme program.

1091
01:26:01.357 --> 01:26:04.026
Gonzales runs it now.
He says Kelly went bonkers.

1092
01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:07.930
that he's out there talking to
little men from other planets.

1093
01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:11.200
Somehow Treya and I found that
strangely reassuring.

1094
01:26:11.234 --> 01:26:13.101
The studies
are actually amazing.

1095
01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:14.703
The five-year survival rate

1096
01:26:14.737 --> 01:26:16.939
for Treya's general type of
metastatic breast cancer

1097
01:26:16.972 --> 01:26:18.974
is exactly zero percent.

1098
01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.976
But in Gonzales' study.
there are already three

1099
01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:24.747
five-year plus survivors.
even one over 17 years.

1100
01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.783
So. it's no fly-by-night clinic.

1101
01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:31.654
though we would try those too
if we thought it would help.

1102
01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.222
Gonzales uses blood analysis

1103
01:26:33.256 --> 01:26:36.259
to indicate the extent
of tumor activity.

1104
01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:39.262
and before we told him.
he nailed all the same facts

1105
01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:42.097
informed of through
conventional medicine.

1106
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.667
His test measures
tumor activity in the body

1107
01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.103
from zero to 50.
with 45 being incurable.

1108
01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:51.274
Treya scored a 38.

1109
01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:54.243
The disconcerting thing
is that when it's working.

1110
01:26:54.277 --> 01:26:57.446
when tumors are being dissolved.
they flare up.

1111
01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.916
So. Gonzales' tests showing
that Treya is getting better

1112
01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.785
is interpreted by
the conventional doctors

1113
01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:06.021
that Treya is dying.

1114
01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:09.725
And Treya. of course.
handles this like a champion.

1115
01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:14.263
And Hazel'll be happy to know.
if I don't write another book.

1116
01:27:14.297 --> 01:27:16.899
I'll be able to make it
as a care person.

1117
01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:18.401
or at least a maid.

1118
01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:24.340
Like a couple of kids. somehow.
we're having a ball with it.

1119
01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:29.211
An average CEA.

1120
01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.947
which indicates the amount
of active cancer in your body.

1121
01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.849
measures zero to five.

1122
01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:36.819
Yours was 7.7 in January.

1123
01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:39.355
After your first treatment
in Germany. it was 13.

1124
01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:42.325
then 16.7 when you got home.

1125
01:27:42.358 --> 01:27:45.027
This read is at 21.

1126
01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:49.164
Now. Treya. I'm telling you that
what we're seeing here is real.

1127
01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:51.900
I strongly recommend starting
an immediate high-dose chemo

1128
01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:53.802
followed by
a bone marrow transplant.

1129
01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:57.473
We're gonna talk it over
and we'll let you know.

1130
01:27:57.506 --> 01:27:58.407
Okay.

1131
01:28:15.257 --> 01:28:16.892
Dr. Gonzales' office.

1132
01:28:16.925 --> 01:28:19.495
Hi Lisa.
It's Treya for Dr. Gonzales.

1133
01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:21.830
Oh hi. Treya. one moment.

1134
01:28:21.864 --> 01:28:22.865
Thank you.

1135
01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:27.470
Hey guys. great news.

1136
01:28:27.503 --> 01:28:30.773
Your score dropped
from 38 to 33.

1137
01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.475
the biggest drop I've ever seen

1138
01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:34.777
in only one month
on the program.

1139
01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.879
Now. some of that drop
may be due to

1140
01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:38.981
the anti-estrogens
you're taking.

1141
01:28:39.014 --> 01:28:42.351
but I think this is
definitely gonna work.

1142
01:28:42.385 --> 01:28:43.819
* Nicola

1143
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.223
* Whatever love will make

1144
01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:54.963
* Love erases

1145
01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:59.001
* And all these twins

1146
01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:03.105
* With different faces

1147
01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:07.543
* Fallen from the womb

1148
01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:12.014
* Risen from the tomb

1149
01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:15.017
* Carried in perfume

1150
01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.254
* Nicola

1151
01:29:29.565 --> 01:29:31.233
Thank you.

1152
01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:34.369
I have one more for you called
"I Want To Live."

1153
01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:37.372
but first I'd like to introduce
a dear friend of mine

1154
01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:39.307
who's going to share
a few words.

1155
01:29:39.341 --> 01:29:41.109
Treya Wilber.

1156
01:29:47.516 --> 01:29:48.617
Thank you.

1157
01:29:48.651 --> 01:29:49.552
Yeah.

1158
01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:07.035
-Hello. My name
is Treya Killam Wilber.

1159
01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:10.372
Many of you here
have known me as Terry.

1160
01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:13.075
I've been involved with
Windstar from the early days.

1161
01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:19.081
Five years ago.
in August of '83.

1162
01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:23.018
I met and totally fell in love
with Ken Wilber.

1163
01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:26.455
I always used to call it
love at first touch.

1164
01:30:26.489 --> 01:30:28.290
We were married.

1165
01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:30.593
And then. ten days
after our wedding.

1166
01:30:30.626 --> 01:30:33.629
I was diagnosed with
stage two breast cancer.

1167
01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:37.700
We spent our honeymoon
in the hospital.

1168
01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:43.071
Since then.
I've had two recurrences.

1169
01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:45.140
and many types of treatment.

1170
01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.442
both conventional
and alternative.

1171
01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:51.680
But in January of this year.

1172
01:30:51.714 --> 01:30:55.450
we discovered the cancer
had metastasized.

1173
01:30:55.484 --> 01:30:58.521
that it had spread
to my brain and to my lungs.

1174
01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:03.692
So. when Tommy asked me to speak
at this event.

1175
01:31:03.726 --> 01:31:08.363
I thought. well.
perhaps I can look at

1176
01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:12.501
what I've done with my life
since the diagnosis.

1177
01:31:12.535 --> 01:31:14.402
I co-founded
the Cancer Support Community

1178
01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:17.005
in San Francisco.

1179
01:31:17.039 --> 01:31:18.507
I've written
as honestly as I can

1180
01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:20.375
about my inner explorations

1181
01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:24.279
in a way that many tell me
they've found helpful.

1182
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.414
And I plan to publish a book.

1183
01:31:26.448 --> 01:31:28.751
Maybe my letters
to many of you will be in it.

1184
01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:35.591
But then I realized. oh.
I'd fallen into a familiar trap.

1185
01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:40.028
I'm equating success
with achievement.

1186
01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:45.000
Learning to make friends
with perhaps painful death

1187
01:31:45.033 --> 01:31:46.268
has taught me a great deal

1188
01:31:46.301 --> 01:31:50.739
about making friends
with myself as I am.

1189
01:31:50.773 --> 01:31:54.710
and a great deal about making
friends with life as it is.

1190
01:31:57.379 --> 01:31:59.314
There's an old saying.

1191
01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:03.451
it's popular among people
with cancer that goes...

1192
01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:09.024
I'm lucky because I've been
given advanced warning

1193
01:32:09.057 --> 01:32:12.094
and the time to act
on that warning.

1194
01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:15.598
Because
I can no longer ignore death.

1195
01:32:15.631 --> 01:32:18.500
I pay more attention to life.

1196
01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:09.317
-Yes. it's true
that if the enzymes

1197
01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:11.586
Gonzales has you on
were breaking the tumors down.

1198
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:12.721
they would swell.

1199
01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:15.624
and a CAT scan wouldn't
differentiate that.

1200
01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:18.360
But you have an average
tumor growth rate

1201
01:33:18.393 --> 01:33:21.363
of over 30 percent
in a short period of time.

1202
01:33:21.396 --> 01:33:23.699
And because of the growth
of the large brain tumor

1203
01:33:23.732 --> 01:33:25.333
and the swelling
of the right brain.

1204
01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:26.802
it's pushed
the left side of your brain

1205
01:33:26.835 --> 01:33:28.737
just a bit out of place.

1206
01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:31.139
So this is what accounts
for some of your symptoms.

1207
01:33:31.173 --> 01:33:35.678
the headaches. the fullness.
disorientation.

1208
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:38.113
-That's why the pain
in the back of my eyes

1209
01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:41.283
goes away when I sleep
with my head raised.

1210
01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:46.321
-Yes. Now. look.

1211
01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:49.157
I am familiar with
Gonzalez's program

1212
01:33:49.191 --> 01:33:50.492
and I don't mean to alarm you.

1213
01:33:50.525 --> 01:33:52.594
but I do want you
to hear it straight.

1214
01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.196
Despite what
his radiologist says.

1215
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:56.164
this is not
an inflammatory reaction

1216
01:33:56.198 --> 01:33:57.800
brought on by tumor necrosis.

1217
01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:00.568
-If your understanding
of this is accurate. though.

1218
01:34:00.602 --> 01:34:03.538
chemo doesn't offer
a solution either. correct?

1219
01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:08.410
-Likely not.

1220
01:34:08.443 --> 01:34:11.313
Though there are other drugs
you can try with it.

1221
01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:14.917
-I'm not afraid of dying.
but I am afraid of pain.

1222
01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.888
-Let me assure you.
we can handle that.

1223
01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:23.225
I promise you that won't happen.

1224
01:34:30.232 --> 01:34:32.768
-Otherwise. you okay?

1225
01:34:34.803 --> 01:34:35.838
-Yes.

1226
01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:42.210
When I die.
I'll just dissolve back.

1227
01:34:43.545 --> 01:34:45.247
That's not frightening.

1228
01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:50.385
-You know. I have never
had a patient like you.

1229
01:34:52.487 --> 01:34:53.655
May I tell you that?

1230
01:34:59.895 --> 01:35:01.196
-Thank you.

1231
01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.541
-Hi. babe.

1232
01:35:49.912 --> 01:35:51.246
-Hey. lover.

1233
01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:55.350
I was looking for you
in my dream.

1234
01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:03.691
-I was looking for you
in this house.

1235
01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:07.695
-I was dreaming about you too.

1236
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:17.572
-I can barely feel it.

1237
01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.041
but it's cold. huh?

1238
01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.777
Does this answer that?

1239
01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.715
-Let's get back to bed.

1240
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:37.459
Can you carry me?

1241
01:36:40.462 --> 01:36:41.463
-Of course.

1242
01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:01.649
"Moreover.
much as you may wander.

1243
01:37:01.683 --> 01:37:04.552
"you must return
ultimately to the Self.

1244
01:37:12.027 --> 01:37:15.330
"so why not abide
in the Self here and now.

1245
01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:20.768
Grace is there all along."

1246
01:37:27.642 --> 01:37:28.776
I'm going.

1247
01:37:36.919 --> 01:37:38.086
-Okay.

1248
01:37:49.631 --> 01:37:54.669
-Wait. Wait. Sweetheart...

1249
01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.642
I want to write something
in my journal.

1250
01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:47.789
Do you understand?

1251
01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:51.960
-I think so.

1252
01:38:58.766 --> 01:38:59.968
Come on. gorgeous.

1253
01:39:02.504 --> 01:39:04.172
Let me take my girl to our room.

1254
01:39:42.144 --> 01:39:46.781
-I'm going.
I can't believe it.

1255
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:49.684
I'm going.

1256
01:39:52.854 --> 01:39:59.794
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.

1257
01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.664
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.

1258
01:40:10.038 --> 01:40:12.006
But I don't want to leave you.

1259
01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:16.878
I love you so much.

1260
01:40:18.246 --> 01:40:21.683
I can't leave you.

1261
01:40:21.716 --> 01:40:23.585
I love you so much.

1262
01:40:26.088 --> 01:40:27.789
Honey.

1263
01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:33.095
-I love you so much.

1264
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:40.502
-Honey. if it's time to go.
then it's time to go.

1265
01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:44.639
Don't worry. I'll find you.

1266
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.709
I found you before.

1267
01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:52.180
I promise I'll find you again.

1268
01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:56.551
-You promise you'll find me?

1269
01:40:58.586 --> 01:41:00.088
-I promise.

1270
01:41:12.134 --> 01:41:14.035
I promise.

1271
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:27.282
-Forever and forever?

1272
01:41:27.315 --> 01:41:29.684
-Forever and forever.

1273
01:41:38.226 --> 01:41:39.894
-Then I can go.

1274
01:41:42.297 --> 01:41:44.166
I can't believe it.

1275
01:41:45.267 --> 01:41:46.701
I'm so happy.

1276
01:41:54.376 --> 01:41:58.646
This has been so much harder
than I thought.

1277
01:42:03.218 --> 01:42:06.854
It's been so hard.

1278
01:42:06.888 --> 01:42:09.090
Oh honey. it's been so hard.

1279
01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:16.964
-I know. sweetheart. I know.

1280
01:42:24.172 --> 01:42:25.840
-You promise you'll be there?

1281
01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:32.980
-I promise you I'll be there.

1282
01:42:53.768 --> 01:42:56.103
-You're the greatest man
I've ever known.

1283
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.107
My champion.

1284
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:04.279
My champion.

1285
01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:22.196
I'll find you.

1286
01:43:39.247 --> 01:43:41.849
You're the only...

1287
01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:52.226
I'll find you. honey.

1288
01:43:54.996 --> 01:43:56.864
I will...

1289
01:45:41.869 --> 01:45:42.937
You promise?

1290
01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:48.042
I promise.

1291
01:46:11.032 --> 01:46:13.200
-My name is
Treya Killam Wilber.

1292
01:46:13.234 --> 01:46:15.336
A lot of you've known me
in the past as Terry.

1293
01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:17.138
I've been involved with
Windstar from the early days.

1294
01:46:19.574 --> 01:46:22.944
Five years ago this same month.
in August of '83.

1295
01:46:22.977 --> 01:46:26.113
I met and totally fell in love
with Ken Wilber.

1296
01:46:26.147 --> 01:46:29.216
I always called it
love at first touch.

1297
01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:31.953
We were married less than
four months later.

1298
01:46:31.986 --> 01:46:33.555
But ten days after our wedding.

1299
01:46:33.588 --> 01:46:37.224
I was diagnosed with
stage two breast cancer.

1300
01:46:37.258 --> 01:46:38.893
We spent our honeymoon
in the hospital.

1301
01:46:41.295 --> 01:46:43.230
I've...I've had
two local recurrences

1302
01:46:43.264 --> 01:46:44.499
and a number of treatments.

1303
01:46:44.532 --> 01:46:46.300
both conventional
and alternative.

1304
01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:48.970
in the intervening years.

1305
01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:50.271
But just this January.

1306
01:46:50.304 --> 01:46:53.007
we discovered that the cancer
had metastasized.

1307
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.309
that it had spread
to my brain and to my lungs.

1308
01:46:56.544 --> 01:46:58.012
The doctors we've consulted
have said

1309
01:46:58.045 --> 01:47:01.583
I have two to four years
to live.

1310
01:47:01.616 --> 01:47:04.218
Because I could
no longer ignore death.

1311
01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:06.020
I pay more attention to life.

1312
01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.492
In the years
after Treya passed.

1313
01:47:10.525 --> 01:47:14.996
I began slowly working my way
back into the world.

1314
01:47:15.029 --> 01:47:18.600
I began writing again.
starting with Grace and Grit .

1315
01:47:18.633 --> 01:47:22.336
which I had promised her
I would write.

1316
01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:25.239
Usually. my books
are dedicated to a person

1317
01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:27.609
important in my life.

1318
01:47:27.642 --> 01:47:32.013
But the next ten books I wrote
over the next ten years

1319
01:47:32.046 --> 01:47:34.448
had no dedications at all

1320
01:47:34.482 --> 01:47:37.685
because each of them
were dedicated to her

1321
01:47:37.719 --> 01:47:42.590
in simple. ongoing
gratefulness.

1322
01:47:42.624 --> 01:47:46.260
Those years with Treya
are etched into my soul

1323
01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:49.597
and somehow.
our love lives on.

1324
01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:13.287
* We rattle a gateless gate

1325
01:48:18.459 --> 01:48:22.163
* And push against
A weightless weight *

1326
01:48:27.268 --> 01:48:30.504
* Looking for
A stateless state *

1327
01:48:34.175 --> 01:48:36.243
* Nicola

1328
01:48:37.612 --> 01:48:40.514
* Whatever love will make

1329
01:48:42.116 --> 01:48:45.452
* Love erases

1330
01:48:47.288 --> 01:48:51.025
* And all these twins

1331
01:48:51.058 --> 01:48:54.095
* With different faces

1332
01:48:55.496 --> 01:48:59.500
* Fallen from the womb

1333
01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:04.171
* Risen from the tomb

1334
01:49:04.205 --> 01:49:07.241
* Carried in perfume

1335
01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.378
* Nicola

1336
01:49:14.081 --> 01:49:20.421
* Ooohh

1337
01:49:22.456 --> 01:49:27.662
* Ooohh

1338
01:49:29.196 --> 01:49:32.767
* All the ones alive today

1339
01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:41.542
* Are the ones
That passed away *

1340
01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:50.384
* Are the ones
Who're on their way *

1341
01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.522
* Nicola

1342
01:49:57.091 --> 01:50:00.127
* Whatever love will take

1343
01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:05.299
* Love replaces

1344
01:50:06.567 --> 01:50:10.271
* And all these twins

1345
01:50:10.304 --> 01:50:13.574
* With different faces

1346
01:50:14.776 --> 01:50:19.080
* Fallen from the womb

1347
01:50:19.113 --> 01:50:23.350
* Risen from the tomb

1348
01:50:23.384 --> 01:50:26.888
* Carried in perfume

1349
01:50:28.856 --> 01:50:30.892
* Nicola

1350
01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:40.534
* Ooohh

1351
01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:46.808
* Ooohh
