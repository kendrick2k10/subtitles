You'’re hitting
like a little girl.[chuckles]

There you go.
Listen. son. I'’m your father.

98
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.477
Yeah. someone
told me that.

00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.045
I also happen to know
what I'’m talking about.
Give me two.

100
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.091
Look. those nightmares
you'’re having?

101
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.006
They ain'’t going away.
all right?

102
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.748
You need to do something
about them. All right?

103
00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:21.011
These things can
shut you down like that.

104

Deeper than you know. Okay?

105
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.062
And you need to let someone--
me. somebody-- help you.

106

Okay. and anything
can trigger. all right?

115
00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:51.825
Hey. I'’m not gonna
come into the ring

117

00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:00.877
She'’s taken a lot on.Come on. Pop.

119
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:03.663
And for her sake. trust me.

120

Yeah.Respect her love for you.

121
00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:09.016
Can you do that?

122
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.540
Yeah.Okay. That'’s my boy.

123
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:14.586
Yes. sir.All right. show me what
you got! What you got!

124
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.764
Ho! Ho! That'’s my boy!
Give me two.

125
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.243
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

126
00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:21.332
[grunting]Ho!

127
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.291
What you got.
what you got. what you got?

128
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.336
[both laughing]

129
00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:30.559
[Kate] <i>Okay. And...</i>

130
00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:33.431
we saved the best for last.

131
00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:36.217
In Morocco. on the edge
of the Sahara desert.

132
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:39.220
near what is now
the Algerian border.

133
00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:41.352
a team of archaeologists

134
00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:44.094
were exploring the depths
of an abandoned mine

135
00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:47.489
when they came across
something incredible.

136
00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:52.799
315.000-year-old human bones...

137
00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:57.368
[crowd gasps]...which shake the foundation
of human history to its core.

138
00:11:57.542 --> 00:12:00.763
Because scientific research
has believed that human origins

139
00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:05.333
started 200.000 years ago.
and in eastern Africa.

140
00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:08.205
So it was believed
that humanity spread out

141
00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:10.120
and then populated the world.

142
00:12:10.294 --> 00:12:14.298
But this discovery in Morocco
is changing all of that.

143
00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:17.737
It'’s making us examine
our belief of where and when

144
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:20.914
humans first walked on Earth.

145
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.959
[crowd murmuring]So...

146
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:26.789
I contacted my friends at NASA.
and I asked for their help.

147
00:12:26.963 --> 00:12:29.574
And this is what we found.

148
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.577
[crowd exclaims]

149
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.407
Ladies and gentlemen.
it is without a doubt

150
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:39.541
that we have found
a large. ancient city

151
00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:42.849
of unknown origin
under the desert.

152
00:12:43.023 --> 00:12:44.633
Now. I'’ve been working closely

153
00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:46.853
with the Moroccan
antiquity authorities.

154
00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:51.161
and I am proud to say that
myself and my team here

155
00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:54.425
have been granted access
to excavate.

Younes! Take him
and get back to the base.

165
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:44.388
They don'’t want us.
they just want the meds
and the doctors. all right?

166
00:13:44.562 --> 00:13:47.696
I'’m not leaving you here!Get back to the base

<i>Daesh.</i>

352
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:01.027
She'’s in Algeria.

353
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:03.594
Younes. how the fuck
could this have happened
in less than 24 hours?

354
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:05.205
<i>We had all eyes on them.</i>

355
00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:07.860
One of my men was even killed
trying to rescue her.

356
00:28:08.034 --> 00:28:09.818
as well as her
government liaison.

357
00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:12.386
<i>Kate was seen taken alive

358

I'’m on the first flight out.

359
00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:48.944
Hey. Dad.

360
00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:50.641

But Pop Pop will
be here shortly. okay?

365
00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:02.218
He'’ll take care
of everything.

366
00:29:08.007 --> 00:29:09.530
I'’ll be back soon.

367
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:54.444
[in Arabic] Get off.

368
00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:56.403
Come on.

369
00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:11.722
Move.

[man speaks Arabic]

373
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:08.475
Welcome to Algeria.
What are you doing here?

374
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.218
We didn'’t mean
to cross the border.

375
00:31:12.392 --> 00:31:14.046
I am on a dig
that is sanctioned

376
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.222

383
00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:41.160
What'’s your name?

And you.

392
00:32:08.578 --> 00:32:09.666
Jean Rashidi. sir.

393
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.886
[laughing]

394
00:32:14.497 --> 00:32:17.152
[in Arabic] Another bastard
who denies his Muslim origins.

395
00:32:17.326 --> 00:32:20.155
[in French]
Why not Michael or Lucien?

396
00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:24.594
And where do you
come from. Mr. Rachidi?

397
00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:28.250

Born and raised in Paris
from Algerian parents.

398
00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:30.949
French-Algerian.

399
00:32:31.123 --> 00:32:33.081
Sunni or Shia?

400
00:32:34.822 --> 00:32:35.692
You don'’t know or what?

401
00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:37.781
Sunni. sir! Sunni!

402
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:41.002
Do you know how to pray?

403
00:32:43.178 --> 00:32:46.312
I said. do you know
how to pray?

404
00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:48.531
At this exact moment...

405
00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:50.664
I'’d really like to pray
and implore him.

406
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:52.883
So pray. you piece of shit!

407
00:32:58.628 --> 00:33:00.891

Paxton. brother.Younes.

410
00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:23.001
Tell me something
about these guys.

411
00:33:23.175 --> 00:33:24.698
These people are
some fringe group.

412
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:26.613
just recently pledged
allegiance to ISIS.

413
00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.267
We know very little
about them.

414
00:33:29.398 --> 00:33:30.791
The Moroccan government liaison

415
00:33:30.965 --> 00:33:32.967
must have missed
the borderline with Algeria.

416
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:35.100
It can easily happen
when you walk this river.

417
00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:38.190
Then they show up
out of nowhere the minute
Kate and her team crossed.

418
00:33:38.364 --> 00:33:40.627
Security breach.Most likely. yes.

419
00:33:41.454 --> 00:33:43.847
Any leads?The driver.

420
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.937
He was driving Kate'’s vehicle.
He'’s nowhere to be found.

421
00:33:51.638 --> 00:33:53.727
[engine starts]

422

[coughing. gagging]

426
00:34:32.244 --> 00:34:33.810
[man in English]
What'’s wrong with you?

427
00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:35.943
[retching]Are you pregnant?

428
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:37.814

432
00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:48.129
[in Arabic] Listen...
I want you to feed her.

433
00:34:48.303 --> 00:34:50.305
Look at me when I talk to you.

434
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:52.090
You feed her. ok?

435
00:34:52.264 --> 00:34:54.353
Watch her
and watch your back. ok?

436
00:34:54.527 --> 00:34:55.876
I spoke with Jaafar earlier.

437
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.573
You'’ll get your own
Kalashnikov by tomorrow.

438
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.715
[in English]
Eat your food.

439
00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:11.196
I'’ll watch you.Hey.

440

Hey. you speak English?

441
00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:15.548
I learned from
American movies.

442
00:35:15.722 --> 00:35:17.158
What'’s your. uh--

443
00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:20.205
What'’s your favorite
movie star?

444
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:23.817
Jackie Chan.

445
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:27.212
[laughs] That'’s a good choice.
He'’s mine. too.

446
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:32.260
What'’s your name?Uh. my name is Omar.

447
00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:35.220

448
00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:36.960
It'’s really nice to meet you.

449
00:35:43.358 --> 00:35:44.881
Do you know where
my friends are?

450
00:35:48.407 --> 00:35:49.625
In other rooms.

451
00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:52.933
Are they okay?

452
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:56.545
Yes. For now.

453
00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.548
[softly] Okay.

454
00:36:02.725 --> 00:36:04.901
[retches. coughs]

455
00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.555
Be quiet.

456
00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:08.644
Hey. be quiet.

457
00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:10.777
Don'’t bring attention
to you.

458
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:13.867
Okay? I'’m gonna
bring you some water.

459
00:36:17.436 --> 00:36:19.438
[locks door]

460
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:21.831
[birds chirping]

461

<i>The age-old Sahara conflict
between Morocco and Algeria</i>

462
00:36:29.752 --> 00:36:31.972

Come in. Fitzy.

that UN vote next week.

475
00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:10.010
if it favors Morocco.
the American and British
oil companies

476
00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:12.447
will be able
to keep drilling
in Moroccan Sahara.

477
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:14.232
And considering
what just happened

478
00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:17.191
and the fact that it happened
in Algerian territory.

479
00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:19.411
the majority of the vote
is gonna favor Morocco.

480
00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:22.152
which in effect
will create a...

481
00:37:22.327 --> 00:37:24.851
what you might call
an epic win for Big Oil.

482
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:27.941
Quite the coincidence?

483
00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:30.944
Hmm. Indeed.

484
00:37:31.118 --> 00:37:34.556
So. they'’re here.
We should discuss
our approach?

485
00:37:37.037 --> 00:37:38.256
Our approach.

486
00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:41.824
Would you like a drink?No. thank you.

487
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:43.652
More for me.

488
00:37:44.914 --> 00:37:48.440
You know. when my wife
and I transferred here.

489
00:37:48.614 --> 00:37:50.093
we were very excited...

490
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.008
[pouring]

491
00:37:53.096 --> 00:37:54.750
...once we left Pakistan.

492
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:58.667
We were looking for a quieter.
more peaceful place

493
00:37:58.841 --> 00:38:01.104
and perhaps some weekends
in Marrakech.

494
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.063
And instead...

495
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:05.500
we got a different part
of the same jungle.

496
00:38:05.674 --> 00:38:06.762
Cheers.

497
00:38:07.763 --> 00:38:09.330
So. Captain Paxton.

498
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.725
He'’s very concerned.

499
00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:14.596
He also works for
Globe Security Group.

500
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.207
He'’s a hostage negotiator.One of the best.

501
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:21.037
He was responsible
for the release of
those students in Nigeria.

502
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:23.083
and that was no small feat.

503
00:38:24.214 --> 00:38:25.955
We can'’t have him involved
in this. Earl.

504
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:28.697
Under no circumstances.

505
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.357
I'’ve read
the rule book. Fitzy.

506
00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:42.537
Nevertheless. I'’m excited
to meet him. so...

507
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:45.540
I suggest...
I just won'’t let him in.

508
00:38:45.714 --> 00:38:46.759
Hmm?

509
00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.109
Of course.

510
00:38:50.937 --> 00:38:52.591

511

Captain Paxton has been granted
clearance on our side.

528
00:39:40.682 --> 00:39:42.467
Uh. Chief. Ma'’am.

529
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:45.818
You know that US government
policy does not allow

530
00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.559
relatives or friends
to participate--

531
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:49.474
Mr. Fitzgerald.

532
00:39:49.648 --> 00:39:51.780
We expect full cooperation
between our governments.

533
00:39:53.173 --> 00:39:56.263
Captain Paxton is now
a part of our task force.

534
00:39:56.437 --> 00:39:57.743
Let'’s get
this briefing going.

535
00:39:57.917 --> 00:40:00.049
I agree.
Please. have a seat.

536
00:40:08.884 --> 00:40:11.191
Well. we know
that the hostages

537
00:40:11.365 --> 00:40:13.106
are in Algeria.
we just don'’t know where.

538
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.890
We also know
that the Algerians

539
00:40:15.064 --> 00:40:17.850
are as pissed off
about this as we are.

540
00:40:18.024 --> 00:40:20.026
and I see as a first step

541
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.159
that we give '’em the time
to get intel on the ground.

542
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:25.727
We all agree negotiation
is out of the question.

543
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:29.383
The leader'’s name
is Jaafar El Hadi.

544
00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:32.908
He'’s been on Interpol'’s radar
for a couple of years now.

545
00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:35.433
Fitz. brief us.
What do we know about him?

546
00:40:35.607 --> 00:40:39.698
[sighs] Well. El Hadi is French.
of Algerian origins.

547
00:40:39.872 --> 00:40:43.397
he'’s a wealthy businessman.
He likes money.

548
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:45.660
He likes his picture
in the paper.

549
00:40:46.705 --> 00:40:49.055
He was radicalized
two years ago.

550
00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:52.667
bankrolled two attacks
in Paris.

551
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:55.322
He has the means to have
a self-sufficient operation.

552
00:40:55.496 --> 00:40:57.585
gather followers
and buy weapons.

553
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.283
We think he'’s ISIS-inspired.

554
00:41:01.023 --> 00:41:02.677
He wants their attention.

555
00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:05.724
Captain. thoughts?

556
00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:07.856
It'’s been 24 hours.

557
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.729
We have not heard
from El Hadi.
That is alarming.

558
00:41:12.252 --> 00:41:14.428
We need intel
on the ground now. sir.

559
00:41:14.602 --> 00:41:16.256
and not just
from the Algerians.

560
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.388
Once we find him.
we can extract them.

561
00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:22.044
A rescue mission.Yes. sir.

562
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:25.221
They were taken to be beheaded.
They'’ll be dead within days.

563
00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:28.486
Well. the Algerians
are looking.

564
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.401
and they'’re trying to gather
the intel that we need.

565
00:41:31.576 --> 00:41:35.057
because right now.
I must confess.
we'’re operating blind.

566
00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:40.715
With all due respect.
Mr. Ambassador. sir...

567
00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:45.241
besides the Algerians.
we have intel superpowers
right here at this table.

568
00:41:46.808 --> 00:41:48.288
We should be able
to find them.

569
00:41:48.462 --> 00:41:50.246
We should.

570
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.683
Yes. sir.

571
00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:54.512
Okay. let'’s get on it.

572
00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:02.955
Mm-hmm.Thank you.

573
00:42:06.915 --> 00:42:09.439
Can I get a spoon. please?Of course.

574
00:42:09.614 --> 00:42:10.745
There you go.Thanks.

575
00:42:10.919 --> 00:42:12.921
There you go.

But we can benefit
from it for our cause.

626

in this situation.

anything.

a place where the Algerians
aren'’t looking.

649

outside of the police station.

He had my business card
I gave to Mrs. Paxton.

657

He'’s scared a bit
but I guess he'’s ok.

talk to anyone...

00:49:38.366 --> 00:49:40.978
[muttering]

699
00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:42.805
Please.
[panting]

700
00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:45.112
Please. please. please!

701
00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.071
[crying. whimpering]

702
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:52.076
Please don'’t do this.
Please don'’t do this.

703
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.470
[cries out]

704
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:03.391
Please. [crying]

705
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:50.743
You didn'’t have
to do that.

706
00:50:52.484 --> 00:50:54.790
I would have gone if
you had just asked me to.

707
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:57.967
You'’re a liar.

708
00:50:59.491 --> 00:51:03.234
You said to my colleague...
you were not pregnant.

709
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.282
And here...
we don'’t like lies.

710
00:51:09.414 --> 00:51:11.198
Especially from women.

711
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:29.129
I didn'’t know.

712
00:51:36.136 --> 00:51:38.443
[sighs]
What do you want from me?

713
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:47.104
I want you to speak
to your government...

714
00:51:49.236 --> 00:51:52.152
and let them know
if they don'’t pay the ransom.

715
00:51:53.284 --> 00:51:55.329
Saturday night
after the evening prayer.

716
00:51:55.503 --> 00:51:58.637
you and your child
are going to die.

717
00:52:05.774 --> 00:52:07.428
Can I ask how much
I'’m worth?

718
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:13.086
Ten million dollars.

719
00:52:14.957 --> 00:52:16.611
[sighs]

720
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.574
What goes through your mind
when you kill a woman
and her unborn child?

721
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:25.446
[humorless chuckle]

722
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.102
I think of... all the kids.

723
00:52:29.276 --> 00:52:32.671
all the women.
all the innocent men.

724
00:52:32.845 --> 00:52:35.064
that your government
has killed.

725
00:52:43.116 --> 00:52:44.552
[door closes]

726
00:52:50.428 --> 00:52:51.733
Oh. God.

727
00:52:51.907 --> 00:52:53.692
[sobbing]

728
00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:08.185
[chattering]

729
00:53:14.495 --> 00:53:16.323
[Brad sighs]

730
00:53:21.372 --> 00:53:23.243
What'’s happening. Younes?

731
00:53:23.417 --> 00:53:24.984
We have yet
to debrief him.

732
00:53:28.074 --> 00:53:29.858
[Younes]
He was dropped off.

733
00:53:30.032 --> 00:53:33.601
Or rather. thrown off
a pickup truck.

734
00:53:33.775 --> 00:53:36.865
Tied up and gagged
at a checkpoint near
our side of the border.

735
00:53:38.171 --> 00:53:40.391
He was instructed
to deliver proof of life.

736
00:53:40.565 --> 00:53:43.437
My guys drove him to Rabat.
and here we are.

737
00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:46.310
[Brad] El Hadi wants a show.

738
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:49.878
He wants mainstream
video coverage.

739
00:53:51.358 --> 00:53:52.707
There'’s no online videos yet?

740
00:53:53.665 --> 00:53:54.883
No. nothing yet.

741
00:53:56.668 --> 00:54:00.933
I mean. sending proof of life
with a hostage
is so old school.

742
00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:02.761
It'’s like a fuckin'’ movie.

743
00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:04.110
[footsteps]

744
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:05.981
They started
a livestream.

745
00:54:07.505 --> 00:54:09.420
[Jean]
It is therefore...

746
00:54:09.594 --> 00:54:11.509
we ask our respective
governments

747
00:54:11.683 --> 00:54:13.728
to pay the sum
of $10 million cash

748
00:54:13.902 --> 00:54:16.644
<i>for our safe release.</i>

749
00:54:16.818 --> 00:54:18.907
<i>Otherwise. we will
meet our death</i>

750
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:21.867
<i>this Saturday after
the evening prayer.</i>

751
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.697
[in Arabic] Speak!

752
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.355
[Kate] <i>I would like the US government to consider</i>

753
00:54:31.529 --> 00:54:35.184
that if they cause
my death...

754
00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:40.538
that it is also the death
of my unborn child.

755
00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:42.888
<i>as I am pregnant.</i>

756
00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:04.779
[Fitz sighs]

757
00:55:07.434 --> 00:55:08.957
[Brad] The hostage
said they drove him

758
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:10.655
less than ten hours
to the border.

759
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:12.570
They made one stop
along the way.

760
00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:14.920
probably to refuel.

761
00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:17.705
El Hadi'’s mother
is from Abadla.
in Algeria.

762
00:55:17.879 --> 00:55:20.186
Small town.
Not very populated.

763
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.580
Villages all around.

764
00:55:22.754 --> 00:55:25.626
How far is that town
from the border point
where Kate was taken?

765
00:55:28.194 --> 00:55:30.196
I'’d say at least
a seven-hour drive.

766
00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:37.812
Close enough.

767
00:55:37.986 --> 00:55:40.119
[Issam typing]

768
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.211
[Issam] This is how
it looks from above.

769
00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:49.346
The image may be old.

770
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.436
Are there any cell towers
in that area.
any unusual activity?

771
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:56.657
Nah. nothing unusual.
We didn'’t set up
a proper comm surveillance.

772
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:00.661
Can I get a copy of that?

773
00:56:00.835 --> 00:56:02.184
Roger that.

774
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.277
[in Arabic] This should not
leave this office.

775
00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:09.801
[in Arabic]
I gave him all the info.

776
00:56:09.975 --> 00:56:11.716
but he wants to go by himself
and with an old map.

777
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.500
Not sure he can make it alone.

778
00:56:13.674 --> 00:56:15.589
I can'’t stop him.

779
00:56:15.763 --> 00:56:17.548
He knows the rules.

780
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.204
Let'’s move out.

781
00:57:10.339 --> 00:57:12.603
[gunfire. explosions]

782
00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:18.043
[muffled shouting][gunfire]

783
00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:20.872
[Brad]
Fall back. fall back!
Fall back. guys!

784

786
00:57:27.661 --> 00:57:29.141
[muffled]
You all right?

787
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:32.274
[normal volume]
Yeah. Yeah. I'’m fine.

788
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.544
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

789
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:43.068
Of course.

790
00:57:43.242 --> 00:57:46.027
There'’s not a lot of people
I trust around here. you know?

791
00:57:48.769 --> 00:57:50.467
[sighs]

792
00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.384
I really wanted to stay
that day back in Syria.

793
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:56.951
Oh. man. don'’t--

794
00:57:57.822 --> 00:58:01.260
Yeah. not now.
Ancient history.

795
00:58:01.434 --> 00:58:03.741
That mission was doomed
from the start.

796
00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:06.657
Tell me about it.

797
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:08.789
Don'’t beat yourself up
about it. man.

798
00:58:08.963 --> 00:58:10.835
Just part of the job. okay?

799
00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:15.492
This one'’s off the books.

800
00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:31.551
[in Arabic] Get this to Ahmed.

801
00:58:37.862 --> 00:58:40.821
Hurry up!
We don'’t have all day!

802

[vehicle approaching]

803
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:08.196
Wait a minute.

804
00:59:12.984 --> 00:59:14.115
[in Arabic] Hello. Bendar.

805
00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:15.377
[in Arabic] Hello.

806
00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:16.727
All good?

807
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:17.684
All good. And you?

808
00:59:17.858 --> 00:59:19.338
Just work. as usual.

809
00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:22.210
We need your help
to cross the border.

810
00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:24.430
Of course...

811
00:59:33.657 --> 00:59:36.355
And we'’ll need some guns.

812
00:59:36.529 --> 00:59:38.270
Whatever you need.

813
00:59:46.887 --> 00:59:48.585

I'’m going in there
with you. Brad.

816
01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.864
That was not the deal.

817
01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:09.823
I owe you my life.

818
01:00:12.478 --> 01:00:14.393
I prefer to keep it
that way.

819
01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:19.572
You will never
make it alone.

820
01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:22.793
You need me.

Are you all right?

825
01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:51.169
Can you handle
what'’s coming?

826

[exhales]

827
01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:01.266
I love this woman
more than anything
in this world.

828
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:05.400
I'’ll do whatever it takes.

[in Arabic]
Are you looking for someone?

838
01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:42.584
[in Arabic]
We'’re just passing by.

839
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:43.977
Going to Abadla.

840
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:46.763
Abadla...? What for?

841
01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:50.854
We'’re visiting
our brothers there.

842
01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:52.769
We'’ve come a long way.

843
01:02:54.248 --> 01:02:55.162
What about you?

844
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:57.251
[in Arabic] I'’m with him.

845
01:02:58.557 --> 01:02:59.819
Where are you guys from?

846
01:03:00.515 --> 01:03:01.821
I'’m Moroccan...

847
01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:03.562
any my friend is American.

848
01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:08.523
Come... follow me.

849
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:14.529
[in Arabic]
What are you doing in my city?

850
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:17.445
We want to go to Abadla...

851
01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:20.187
to visit Jaafar El Hadi.

852
01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:28.674
[in English]
Why do you tell me this?
What do you want from me?

853
01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:32.678
[in English] El Hadi is
demanding a $10 million ransom
to release some hostages.

854
01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:35.072
We don'’t think he needs
all of that money.

855
01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:37.378
His army'’s
not big enough.

856
01:03:37.552 --> 01:03:39.641
There are brothers
all around the world
that can use some of that.

857
01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.600
[in English] We want to
negotiate with him--

858
01:03:41.774 --> 01:03:43.515
I have nothing
to do with this.

859
01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.347
Who are you?

860
01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:52.785
I am brother
Abdur Raheem Williams
from Detroit. Michigan.

861
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:58.008
How come I'’ve never
heard about a brother
from Detroit?

862
01:03:58.182 --> 01:04:00.445
I'’ve traveled
all around the world
in the name of our cause.

we operate quietly.
as we must.

865
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:14.024
The less you know.
the better.

866
01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:16.548
I'’ll make sure you
and your people

867
01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.637
are compensated
for your assistance.

868
01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:21.509
We need to send El Hadi
a message of our arrival.

869
01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:24.295
and we'’d appreciate
transportation to get there.

870
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.544
Come with me. please.

871
01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:23.702
I'’m not helping you
because you say that
you'’re Abdur Raheem Williams.

872
01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.965
I'’ll help you because
God gave you the gift

873
01:05:26.966 --> 01:05:29.099

the difference...

874
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:31.710

and the bad.

875
01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:40.980
[in Arabic] Thank you.

876
01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:43.852
[in English]
You have our gratitude.

877
01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.767
Your help will always
be remembered.

878
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.858
Please. um--

879
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.904
Please accept this
for the mosque.

880
01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.863
For the car. at least.

881
01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.357
Mr. Williams...

882
01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.534
be careful.

883
01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:16.624
Those people have
nothing to do with Islam.

884
01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.887
I may very well be
sending you to your death.

885
01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:21.586
My cause is worthy
of my death.

886
01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:42.215
[Younes] It should be
behind that tree.

887
01:06:45.262 --> 01:06:46.437
[Brad] Got it!

888
01:06:58.449 --> 01:06:59.928
You were right.

889
01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.365
About what?

890
01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:03.106
You don'’t need me.

891
01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.760
You can do just fine
on your own.

892
01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:08.589
Well. we'’re not there yet.

893
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.288
We'’re being followed.

894
01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:13.377
Or escorted.

895
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:16.423
We should have no trouble
finding El Hadi now.

896
01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:20.166
How do you figure?Despite what the imam says.

897
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.473
those men must work
for El Hadi.

898
01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:25.563
I'’m sure they'’re trying
to give him a heads-up
that we'’re on our way.

899
01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:28.044
Once we get to Abadla.
let'’s lose '’em...

900
01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:30.698
then we follow them.

901
01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:06.142
Well. hello. hello. hello.

902
01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:11.321
That was almost too easy.Yeah.

903
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:17.675
Thanks for the escort. guys.

904
01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:21.766
Let'’s get this party started.

905
01:09:28.512 --> 01:09:30.775
[spews coffee]

906
01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:33.386
[President] <i>Earl. I know
I'’m stating the obvious.</i>

907
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.301
<i>but we have exactly
two hours--</i>

908
01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:37.695
<i>two hours before
the execution</i>

909
01:09:37.869 --> 01:09:41.177
<i>of a pregnant.
innocent American woman <i>
and a French citizen.</i></i>

910
01:09:41.351 --> 01:09:43.570
[Secretary of State] <i>We have not been able to get the Algerians</i>

911
01:09:43.744 --> 01:09:45.703
<i>to agree to anything.</i>

912
01:09:45.877 --> 01:09:48.271
They want our support
in the UN vote.
but we cannot allow--

913
01:09:48.445 --> 01:09:51.448
Madam Secretary. Please.
I don'’t mean to interrupt.

914
01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:55.539
but the gentleman that we are
dealing with is batshit crazy.

915
01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:58.498
All he wants is for the US
to be on its knees

916
01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:00.283
and to get ISIS cred.

917
01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.676
And he has both.
so I suggest

918
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:05.026
that we send in
the SEALs immediately.

919
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.247
Uh. well. I'’d give you
90% probability

920
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.380
the Algerians
would try to stop us.

921
01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:11.772
Of course they will.

922
01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:17.125
Mr. President.
we'’re nowhere near ready

923
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.692
<i>for a Title 50 operation.</i>

924
01:10:18.866 --> 01:10:21.042
We don'’t have the intel.Yes. we do.

Who are they?
What are they doing?

929
01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:55.816
One of Morocco'’s

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:09.308
Yes. Kate Paxton
is his wife.

936
01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:12.050
Do we know
where they are?

937

[Williams] <i>They have located
the terrorist compound.</i>

938
01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.793
And how do we
know this?

939

Find out. Bring me
all tactical options.

943
01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:32.200
What do we got?

944
01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:36.727
I'’d say 300 meters.

945
01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:46.171
We need all four
in four shots.

946
01:11:48.782 --> 01:11:50.044
Can you make it?

947
01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:53.134

[Williams] Thank you.

1050
01:20:59.158 --> 01:21:01.465
The diplomacy clusterfuck
continues.

1051
01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:06.513
Fitzy...
we are buying time.

1052
01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:11.431
but you need to make sure
that Kate Paxton
gets home safe.

1053
01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:13.216
I'’ll do my best.

1054

<i>Yes. sir.</i>

1060
01:21:41.418 --> 01:21:43.159
[in French] I'’m going to
cut your head off.

1061
01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:47.903
Take me to El Hadi.

1062
01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:49.426
This way.

1063
01:21:57.956 --> 01:21:59.697
[Brad in Arabic] Drop your guns.

1064
01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.179
[in Arabic]
Your Arabic is very good!

1065
01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:05.181

Better than yours.

1066
01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:07.270
[grunts]

1067

[in English] If you shoot me.
he will shoot you...

1068
01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:17.019
and we all die together.

1069
01:22:21.806 --> 01:22:23.590
Is that what you want?

1070
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.465
You want $10 million.

1071
01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:31.468
We'’re here to
negotiate that for you.

1072
01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.651
Then why are you here.
killing my men?

1073
01:22:40.825 --> 01:22:42.305
Who are you?

1074
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.398
I'’m Captain Brad Paxton.
Kate is my wife.

1075
01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:51.009
We know you have
a bank account in Panama.

1076
01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:54.795
We also know the code.
It can be transferred
in a second.

1077
01:22:56.884 --> 01:22:59.017
Then do it!

1078
01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:07.983

[in Arabic] Neo.

1082
01:23:23.737 --> 01:23:25.435
Like the brother
from The Matrix.

1083
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:29.091
[sighs] I'’m the XL version.[laughs]

1084

Katherine!

1130
01:30:00.569 --> 01:30:01.874

[sighs]

1138
01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:45.108
I was not supposed
to be taken.

1139
01:31:45.282 --> 01:31:46.501
That was not the deal.

1140
01:31:48.372 --> 01:31:50.505
You were never
in any danger.

1141
01:31:52.071 --> 01:31:53.986
And you handled it
very well.

1142
01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.119
Amir. very well.

1143
01:31:57.947 --> 01:32:00.253
Your rookie fear
notwithstanding.

1144
01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:06.782
You'’re now an American citizen
and a CIA asset.

1145

good old-fashioned CIA work
in action.

1150
01:32:45.734 --> 01:32:47.431
There'’s nothin'’ like it.

1151
01:32:49.172 --> 01:32:51.740

What about him?

1156
01:33:12.238 --> 01:33:15.154
They suspect something.
The Moroccans do too.

1157
01:33:20.464 --> 01:33:23.119
There are matters...

1158
01:33:24.381 --> 01:33:26.470
kings. presidents...

1159
01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:30.343
and ambassadors
better not...

1160
01:33:32.824 --> 01:33:33.999
know.

1161
01:33:37.916 --> 01:33:39.657
Let'’s make sure of that.
