Royal A. Stratton.

184
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.195
would never return home.

185
00:10:38.942 --> 00:10:43.120
Many young enlisted men
came from small-town America.

186
00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:46.341
places like Ellwood City.
Pennsylvania.

187
00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:48.996
where our veterans are revered

188
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:52.303
and things still move
a little slower.

189
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.786
where family reunions.
old-timey guessing games.

190
00:10:56.873 --> 00:10:59.746
and favorite pastimes
are still alive and well.

191
00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:13.194
For anyone who'’s
lost a loved one in war.

192
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:17.764
the emptiness left behind
can resonate for generations.

193
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:21.289
For my family.
it was World War II.

194
00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:24.988
Many of us didn'’t know
my great uncle. just a name:

195
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:27.730
Royal A. Stratton.

196
00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:30.690
But the few still among us
who did

197
00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:35.520
also reside here.
in small-town America.

198
00:11:35.607 --> 00:11:38.001
I didn'’t know it then.
but going home

199
00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:40.264
is where
my long journey began--

200
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:42.310
traveling back through time.

201
00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:23.743
His orders from Dad
was watch Ada.

202
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.657
'’cause I was the smallest one.

203
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:36.059
I met Royal in School.

204
00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:38.496
We were in
the fifth grade together.

205
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:47.157
He was nice.

206
00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:50.334
We would go out and sit
on our swing on the back porch.

207
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:52.293
and he'’d talk about everything.

208
00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:58.865
I knew Royal
before Mary Ellen knew Royal.

209
00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:00.692
My mother'’s maiden name
was Timmerman.

210
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.433
So it was Mary Ellen Timmerman.

211
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.653
And. he was dating my aunt Kay
at the time.

212
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.742
Well. I was going
with another fella.

213
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:11.051
I said.
"Would you like to meet her??

214
00:13:11.138 --> 00:13:12.443
He said. "Sure!"

215
00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:19.886
That was it.

216
00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:24.281
They hit it off and here we are.

217
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:27.807
My mom. she was a spitfire.

218
00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:30.200
One time when my dad
was supposed to pick her up

219
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:32.986
at seven. and he wasn'’t there. and she left.

220
00:13:33.073 --> 00:13:34.901
And he came
about ten after seven

221
00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.859
and asked where she was
and she said.

222
00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:38.730
"If you'’re not here at seven.
she'’s gone."

223
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.254
She wouldn'’t wait on him.

224
00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.385
From then on.

225
00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:43.083
if he was gonna be late.
he'’d call.

226
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.215
And my grandpa. his dad.

227
00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:47.043
would say.
"I want to meet this girl

228
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.263
that'’s having you call her
when you'’re gonna be late."

229
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.655
He was never late again.

230
00:13:58.098 --> 00:13:59.839
It was about a hundred yards

231
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:01.579
north of where
the present one is.

232
00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:03.277
The building is still there.

233
00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:10.110
It was a Travel Air 2000.

234
00:14:10.197 --> 00:14:11.633
It was a biplane.

235
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.070
Two wings. open cockpits.

236
00:14:14.157 --> 00:14:17.900
powered by a 90-horsepower
OX-5 engine.

237
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:20.860
He was very gifted as a pilot.

238
00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:25.386
And I'’m so proud of him.
very. very proud of him.

239
00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:40.140
We were moored
over at Pearl City Landing.

240
00:14:40.227 --> 00:14:42.011
That morning.

241
00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:44.796
we were all awakened by the...

242
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.363
the bombs going off.

243
00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.900
7:59 a.m.

244
00:15:00.987 --> 00:15:03.511
That'’s when they hit.

245
00:15:03.598 --> 00:15:05.469
When they bombed Pearl Harbor

246
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.384
and they sunk theArizona.

247
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:09.212
and they sunk
those other ships.

248
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:11.606
and those men were
in steaming oil

249
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:13.260
on the sea dying.

250
00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:16.524
the country rallied.
but the country was different.

251
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.657
I was at a movie at the Tivoli
in Richmond. Indiana.

252
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.485
when they closed down
the screen

253
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.966
and the owner came on stage
and told us

254
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:25.141
that we had been bombed.

255
00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:27.665
I think we realized at that time

256
00:15:27.752 --> 00:15:30.581
that we were going to be
in a long fight.

257
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.768
...1941...

258
00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:47.250
Went to school and when we got
to civics class.

259
00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:49.644
our teacher had brought in
this portable radio

260
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:51.472
and we listened spellbound.

261
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:55.867
...a date which will live in infamy.

262
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.914
Infamy; a word
we'’d never heard before.

263
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.698
Then he turned to the Congress

264
00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:02.918
and he asked them
to declare war. and they did.

265
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.660
...with
the unbounding determination

266
00:16:05.747 --> 00:16:08.228
of our people.

267
00:16:08.315 --> 00:16:12.667
we will gain
the inevitable triumph.

268
00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:14.451
so help us God.

269
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.805
There was quite an inundation

270
00:16:20.892 --> 00:16:24.505
of people showing up
at recruiting stations

271
00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:26.855
in the immediate aftermath
of Pearl Harbor.

272
00:16:26.942 --> 00:16:29.989
I enlisted
out of Binghamton. New York.

273
00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:39.433
I signed all the papers and was
sent to Camp Blanding. Florida.

274
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.304
which was an infantry base.

275
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:44.046
and I thank the good Lord
20 times a day

276
00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:45.656
that I didn'’t join the infantry.

277
00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:47.919
I wanted to get in the action.

278
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.530
Of course we were just emerging

279
00:16:49.617 --> 00:16:51.053
from the Great Depression.

280
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.188
America in tragedy
comes together.

281
00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.929
The Depression had
a great leavening effect.

282
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.497
We were living
in a quite different world.

283
00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:05.720
We had rationing: butter.
milk. eggs. silk stockings.

284
00:17:05.807 --> 00:17:07.852
Consequently. a lot of people
would begin to grow

285
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.593
what they called
a Victory Garden.

286
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.944
An estimated 40 percent of
the vegetables grown in America

287
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.859
were grown
in those Victory Gardens.

288
00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:16.165
And there were these drives.

289
00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:17.471
They needed rubber desperately.

290
00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:19.038
They needed scrap metal.

291
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:21.866
And I saved tin foil in bundles

292
00:17:21.953 --> 00:17:24.086
and gave it to the collectors.

293
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:26.306
As a matter of fact.
some people began to give up--

294
00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:27.829
I know Rita Hayworth did--

295
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:30.266
to give up the bumpers
on their cars

296
00:17:30.353 --> 00:17:32.529
to the scrap metal people.
honest to God.

297
00:17:32.616 --> 00:17:35.837
Everybody shared
in the war effort.

298
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:37.839
My mother rolled bandages.

299
00:17:37.926 --> 00:17:40.450
worked for the Red Cross
in Oklahoma.

300
00:17:40.537 --> 00:17:43.279
My great regret then was that
I wasn'’t a little bit older

301
00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:45.890
so I could actually wear
a uniform.

302
00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:48.676
I wanted to do that too.
I wanted to get involved.

303
00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:52.288
So I convinced my mother. if I joined the Navy under-age.

304
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:55.204
I would not be sent overseas
until I was 18.

305
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:57.467
Now. it was a lie.
but I was desperate.

306
00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:59.774
I wanted so badly
to get into the service.

307
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:01.384
It had to be fought.

308
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:05.606
We were fighting Hitler.
Mussolini. and Tojo.

309
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.260
The entire world was at war.

310
00:18:07.347 --> 00:18:09.827
These madmen had to be stopped.

311
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:12.700
So you sign on
and you do what you can.

312
00:18:12.787 --> 00:18:15.006
So we had a nation
that had a purity of purpose

313
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.965
and that was to eliminate evil
in the world.

314
00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:18.575
My name is John Ree.

315
00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:21.361
Freeland C. Terpenning.

316
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:23.580
Walter O. Sheppard.

317
00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:25.060
Milton Robbins.

318
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.409
Mark Kishego.

319
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:27.802
Raymond Lee.

320
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:29.760
-Verle Westerman.
-John Misterly.

321
00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:32.023
-Edward Goetz.
-Lyle Umenhoffer.

322
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.895
-Jerry Yellin.
-Earl Holliman.

323
00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:54.568
There were so many pilots.

324
00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:56.047
were shot down.

325
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.180
and they didn'’t know
whether they survived

326
00:18:58.267 --> 00:19:00.487
or whether they were
in the water for weeks.

327
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.751
The 4th Emergency Rescue
Squadron was formed

328
00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:06.319
when the Navy decided
that they were spending

329
00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:09.583
too much time rescuing
Air Force pilots.

330
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.063
So. the next thing I knew
I had orders to go

331
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.936
through the advanced training
school at Pensacola

332
00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:16.764
learning to fly the PBY.

333
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:20.246
We'’re talking
about a Consolidated PBY.

334
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:23.336
which was a sea plane;
amphibious.

335
00:19:23.423 --> 00:19:25.555
It had landing gear
you could land on.

336
00:19:25.642 --> 00:19:28.558
It was built so that
you could land in water.

337
00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:30.169
Primarily I would say

338
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.954
the thought was rescue
in the open sea.

339
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:35.130
An airplane gets shot down.

340
00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.827
whatever reason
you had to ditch.

341
00:19:36.914 --> 00:19:39.395
a PBY was one
of the best airplanes

342
00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:43.051
for landing and picking up
people and retrieving them.

343
00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:23.961
After we were graduated

344
00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:27.182
from Pensacola. we were
designated Naval Aviators.

345
00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:30.968
We were then entitled to wear Navy Wings and Air Corps Wings.

346
00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:33.797
We wore Air Corps Wings
over our heart.

347
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:35.712
Navy Wings on the right side.

348
00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:38.411
After. we were sent
to Biloxi. Mississippi.

349
00:20:38.498 --> 00:20:39.890
Keesler Field.

350
00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:42.850
That'’s where we became
a member of a crew.

351
00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:00.737
I knew
Royal Stratton real well.

352
00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:02.348
He was a dear good friend.

353
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:03.914
Extremely excellent pilot.

354
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:06.352
I can'’t say enough
about his piloting ability.

355
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.005
And a fine man.

356
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.624
And then flew from there

357
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:21.367
to McClellan Field
in Sacramento. California.

358
00:21:21.454 --> 00:21:24.021
We went over with white planes

359
00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:27.851
and they painted them blue
to match the water

360
00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:31.942
so planes flying above us
wouldn'’t be able to see us.

361
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:35.946
It was a Catalina and we named it Prowlin'’ Puss.

362
00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:39.559
And we had a Prowlin'’ Puss
on the side of the plane

363
00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:42.213
and he'’s sitting
drumming his fingers.

364
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.868
It was a real good picture.

365
00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:46.305
We thought it was.

366
00:21:46.392 --> 00:21:47.784
My engineer.

367
00:21:47.871 --> 00:21:50.265
he came up with the name
Superduck.

368
00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:53.834
And he painted Superduck
on Superduck.

369
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:56.227
We called it the old Lard Ass.

370
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.707
Took off at 90 knots.

371
00:21:57.794 --> 00:21:59.883
flew at 90 knots.
and landed at 90 knots.

372
00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:25.605
We waited there for

373
00:22:25.692 --> 00:22:29.348
our instructions
to go overseas.

374
00:22:37.312 --> 00:22:39.967
John Garfield.
a New York actor.

375
00:22:40.054 --> 00:22:43.753
all excited about
the Stage Door Canteen.

376
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.407
told Bette Davis about it.

377
00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:48.279
It was made up. of course.
of Broadway stage actors

378
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.500
entertaining G.I.s.
American service men.

379
00:22:51.587 --> 00:22:54.851
about to embark for
the adventure of their lives.

380
00:22:54.938 --> 00:22:57.724
And Bette instantly caught fire and said:

381
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:00.857
"This is the West Coast
port of embarkation

382
00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:03.512
and they'’re coming flooding
through here

383
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.862
and they have nowhere to go.

384
00:23:05.949 --> 00:23:08.169
So. there has to be
a Hollywood Canteen."

385
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:10.519
and indeed. it happened.

386
00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:14.654
And they
created this wonderful.

387
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:16.307
wonderful place
where the soldiers.

388
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.527
who were on their way
overseas in the Pacific.

389
00:23:18.614 --> 00:23:21.487
could stop and be fed.
you know. by movie stars

390
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:24.272
and dance with movie stars
and be entertained.

391
00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.492
The war was on. and my mother.

392
00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:28.363
one night she came home
and she said

393
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.409
"You'’re going to sing
at the Hollywood Canteen."

394
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:32.672
And I got out on the stage

395
00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:36.197
and I sang and they stood up
and applauded.

396
00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:39.156
and what I realized is
these young men.

397
00:23:39.243 --> 00:23:43.944
they were so baby-faced.
and young. and courageous.

398
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:47.513
and they loved everything
we did for them. Everything.

399
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.603
We had the big bands
playing there.

400
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.561
One name band after another.

401
00:23:52.648 --> 00:23:54.824
Any that was in town
at the time

402
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:57.131
would be happy to play
for nothing

403
00:23:57.218 --> 00:23:59.263
to our young military.

404
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.092
And so there was some
pretty great dancing done

405
00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.268
on the most crowded
of dance floors.

406
00:24:04.355 --> 00:24:06.357
I got five hours'’ liberty
every night

407
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.272
and I would hightail it
right over

408
00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:09.578
to the Hollywood Canteen.

409
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:11.188
which was incredible.

410
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:13.974
And I remember
walking in one day

411
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:16.498
and there was the great.
gorgeous John Garfield

412
00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:19.675
with his sleeves rolled up
and apron on doing dishes.

413
00:24:19.762 --> 00:24:22.591
And it was a sight that I'’ll
never forget as long as I live.

414
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:24.463
The boys wanted proof

415
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.987
that they had been
to the Hollywood Canteen.

416
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:28.641
So I signed everything.

417
00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:31.905
I had to sign their best girl'’s pictures. imagine.

418
00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:34.821
What a privilege it was for me
to be part of that.

419
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:37.388
The barn held
about a thousand G.I.s

420
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.652
and a number of hostesses
to welcome them.

421
00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:41.131
And finally. one night.

422
00:24:41.218 --> 00:24:42.742
they prepared
for the millionth man

423
00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:45.309
to come through those doors.
and he did.

424
00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:47.616
The place just
absolutely erupted

425
00:24:47.703 --> 00:24:49.009
when he walked
through the door.

426
00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.054
He didn'’t know he was
the millionth man.

427
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:52.882
By the time they closed in '’45.

428
00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:55.145
they had served
three million service men.

429
00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:57.583
Many of them. of course.
never came back.

430
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.325
So that was the last view
they had of America.

431
00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:05.721
and kindness and people
trying to help them.

432
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.121
My mom wanted
to name me Royal Ann.

433
00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:16.471
Thank God she didn'’t.
Dad said no.

434
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:19.082
"If we ever have a son.
we'’ll name him Royal."

435
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:20.736
So he named me Vicky Elaine.

436
00:25:20.823 --> 00:25:23.173
He was gone a lot when
he was in the service and...

437
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.393
he was home when I was born

438
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.830
and then he left when
I was four days old

439
00:25:27.917 --> 00:25:30.354
and that'’s the last we saw him.

440
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:34.010
Then we did get
instructions to go overseas.

441
00:25:34.097 --> 00:25:35.925
I had our aircraft

442
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:39.450
blessed by a priest
before I ever left the States.

443
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.496
But. I'’m not Catholic.

444
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.411
I'’m an Episcopalian.

445
00:25:43.498 --> 00:25:46.370
But I asked each man if
they had any objection to it.

446
00:25:46.457 --> 00:25:47.589
and they said. "No. sir."

447
00:25:47.676 --> 00:25:49.199
And so the airplane was blessed

448
00:25:49.286 --> 00:25:51.898
and I have the Saint Christopher
medal on the wall here.

449
00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:54.465
It was glued
to my instrument panel.

450
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.685
We took off different days
en route

451
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:59.645
to Hickam Air Corps Base
in Honolulu.

452
00:25:59.732 --> 00:26:01.647
And it was a long flight.

453
00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:04.737
We lost a plane
when we first went overseas.

454
00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:06.477
Nobody knows what happened.

455
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.829
It gets awful dark
as you keep going west.

456
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:12.571
And there'’s lots of water
under there.

457
00:26:12.658 --> 00:26:15.312
Our first flight to get
to where we were gonna serve.

458
00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:17.140
we had to make to Hawaii.

459
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.317
As I remember it. we took off

460
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:22.058
about 3 o'’clock in the morning

461
00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:23.625
from Sacramento. California.

462
00:26:23.712 --> 00:26:25.322
And about halfway across.

463
00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:27.237
we got a radio transmission--

464
00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:29.065
it was all in code. of course--

465
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:31.502
they told us to turn around
and go back.

466
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.679
That there was a headwind
gonna hit us

467
00:26:33.766 --> 00:26:36.812
and we probably didn'’t have
enough gas to reach Honolulu.

468
00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:39.119
They want us to return to Sac--

469
00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:43.558
Zalkan. how far are we
from Hawaii?

470
00:26:45.342 --> 00:26:46.822
Seven-point-five hours

471
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:48.258
at our current heading
and airspeed.

472
00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:49.651
If we maintain.
total flight time

473
00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:51.131
will be just over 19 hours.

474
00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:52.828
We'’ve passed the halfway point.

475
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:54.438
What'’s happening?

476
00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:57.528
They want us to turn around
and go back.

477
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.748
To Sacramento?

478
00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:02.142
That doesn'’t make any sense.

479
00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:07.277
Radar operator to engineer.

480
00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:10.454
How long can we stay airborne
with those new Tokyo tanks?

481
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.108
Over.

482
00:27:12.195 --> 00:27:16.330
We got about 20 hours'’
total flight time. Chief. over.

483
00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:18.332
Copy. Doc.

484
00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:22.031
Radio operator to pilot.

485
00:27:22.118 --> 00:27:24.033
Pilot to
radio operator. go ahead.

486
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.556
Lieutenant.
we'’ve been instructed

487
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.733
to return to Sacramento. over.

488
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.083
Copy. Instructed
to return to Sacramento. over.

489
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.606
Return to Sacramento?

490
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:34.348
Sir. I requested
code verification.

491
00:27:34.435 --> 00:27:37.003
Transmitting party
was unable to verify. over.

492
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.439
Copy. unable to verify.

493
00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:39.875
Japanese dummy transmission?

494
00:27:44.532 --> 00:27:46.882
Pilot to crew;
according to my calculations.

495
00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:49.580
we are past the halfway point
to our destination.

496
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:53.323
Therefore. I will ask each
of you to vote. yay or nay.

497
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.717
as to whether we return
to Sacramento.

498
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:58.067
Take a moment to consider. over.

499
00:27:58.154 --> 00:28:01.636
Navigator to pilot. you flying
by ear again. Lieutenant?

500
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:03.116
Pilot to navigator;

501
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:04.552
1st Lieutenant.

502
00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:07.163
And are my calculations
incorrect? Over.

503
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.556
No. sir.

504
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:10.645
Your calculations
are correct. over.

505
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:12.603
Navigator.
please say again. over.

506
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.780
Your calculations are correct.

507
00:28:17.043 --> 00:28:18.958
-Over?
-Over!

508
00:28:19.045 --> 00:28:20.699
Repeat.

509
00:28:22.265 --> 00:28:23.832
And so we all voted--

510
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:25.268
let'’s go ahead.

511
00:28:25.355 --> 00:28:27.183
And when we did land
at Honolulu.

512
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.925
we were in the air
19 hours and 55 minutes

513
00:28:30.012 --> 00:28:31.361
as I remember it.

514
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:33.537
And our flight engineer
later told me--

515
00:28:33.624 --> 00:28:39.239
He said we had about 15 minutes'’
flying time left. so--

516
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:44.679
From Wheeler Field
we went to a little spot

517
00:28:44.766 --> 00:28:46.986
in the ocean called
Johnson Island.

518
00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:49.249
Orders. we finally got them

519
00:28:49.336 --> 00:28:51.686
after two or three weeks.

520
00:28:51.773 --> 00:28:54.645
We searched for General Harmon.

521
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.299
he was an Air Corps General.

522
00:28:56.386 --> 00:28:57.736
Most of the time

523
00:28:57.823 --> 00:29:00.129
when we were searching
for rafts.

524
00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:02.871
I was in the blister
watching for it

525
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:05.482
because radar
wouldn'’t pick it up.

526
00:29:05.569 --> 00:29:08.398
And the radar on our plane
was up high

527
00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:10.618
so you couldn'’t shoot down
with it.

528
00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:12.402
You had to shoot out.

529
00:29:12.489 --> 00:29:15.275
I don'’t think they ever did know
what happened to that plane.

530
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.799
We couldn'’t find any evidence
of it anywhere.

531
00:29:17.886 --> 00:29:20.541
Even though we were all
a bunch of young guys.

532
00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.891
we suddenly became men.

533
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:25.720
So we left there
and headed west again.

534
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:27.243
From Johnson Island

535
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.941
we were sent temporary duty

536
00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:31.595
to Kwajalein. Eniwetok.

537
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:33.249
Bikini Atoll.

538
00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:34.947
and finally to Saipan.

539
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:36.775
When we got to Saipan.

540
00:29:36.862 --> 00:29:41.344
officers and enlisted men
both lived in tents in the mud.

541
00:29:41.431 --> 00:29:44.434
Wise guy me
said. "Where'’s the hotel?"

542
00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:46.349
And they said.
"You'’re sleeping here."

543
00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:48.047
From Saipan.

544
00:29:48.134 --> 00:29:50.005
we had four flights
in the squadron:

545
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:52.007
A flight. B flight.
C flight. D flight.

546
00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:09.329
It was the largest airplane
to go into production

547
00:30:09.416 --> 00:30:11.070
during World War II.

548
00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:13.855
It was a beautiful airplane.
flew beautifully.

549
00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:17.424
One problem. the engines.
they overheated readily.

550
00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:19.295
We were losing
a lot of them at sea.

551
00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:22.211
There were 20 crews
in our squadron.

552
00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:25.736
and of each of the squadrons
assembled on Saipan.

553
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:29.001
I must say that half
of those crews were lost

554
00:30:29.088 --> 00:30:31.481
during the time
we were bombing Japan.

555
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:02.686
It was horrifying because
I don'’t think many of them were

556
00:31:02.773 --> 00:31:05.864
over five feet over the water
when they took off.

557
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:08.779
And it was hair-raising
to them. I'’m sure.

558
00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:33.152
Why was Iwo Jima important?

559
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:35.458
Because it was midway point

560
00:31:35.545 --> 00:31:38.244
from the Marianas to Tokyo.

561
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:39.941
There were two things important

562
00:31:40.028 --> 00:31:41.160
about Iwo Jima.

563
00:31:41.247 --> 00:31:42.639
One. it was within range

564
00:31:42.726 --> 00:31:44.554
of Japan for fighter aircraft:

565
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:47.993
P-47s and P-51s could reach
Japan and come back.

566
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.257
And it was an emergency
landing strip for B-29s

567
00:31:51.344 --> 00:31:54.260
that carried 11
or 12 crew members.

568
00:31:54.347 --> 00:31:58.133
So it was a place of rescue
for the B-29s.

569
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.701
Hundred and fifty of us
got shipped out at one time.

570
00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:04.096
And I'’ll never forget it.
the first sergeant came out.

571
00:32:04.183 --> 00:32:07.621
was giving us a pep talk.

572
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:10.537
and all of a sudden he stopped.

573
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:27.771
He said: "You men are
gonna make history."

574
00:32:27.858 --> 00:32:30.426
And history we did.

575
00:32:35.257 --> 00:32:36.606
During the battle.

576
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:39.870
there was 36 planes
landed there.

577
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.874
The first one was
on the 13th day.

578
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.181
That left 23.

579
00:32:46.268 --> 00:32:47.835
It'’s almost two a day.

580
00:32:47.922 --> 00:32:50.142
And those 36 planes

581
00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:53.275
probably saved 360 lives

582
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:56.626
because there'’s
a minimum crew of ten.

583
00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:58.541
So they attacked Iwo Jima

584
00:32:58.628 --> 00:32:59.716
and finally got it.

585
00:32:59.803 --> 00:33:01.240
My wing of our squadron

586
00:33:01.327 --> 00:33:02.719
were assigned to Iwo

587
00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:06.071
and we flew rescue operations
out of there.

588
00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:07.637
The island itself was

589
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:10.249
about four. or four and a half miles long.

590
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:12.207
and a mile and a half wide.

591
00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:15.428
And there was around 40.000
of us on the island.

592
00:33:15.515 --> 00:33:19.040
Life on Iwo Jima was miserable.

593
00:33:19.127 --> 00:33:20.520
We had no fresh water.

594
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:22.870
They had a distiller ship
out on the ocean

595
00:33:22.957 --> 00:33:24.959
and we drank
distilled ocean water.

596
00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:28.484
That extremely fine volcanic ash
was always in the air.

597
00:33:28.571 --> 00:33:30.965
Our only means of washing up:

598
00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:34.186
going into the ocean
with your clothes on and all.

599
00:33:34.273 --> 00:33:36.579
Where our encampment was down

600
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.407
right next to Suribachi.

601
00:33:38.494 --> 00:33:40.583
There was two crews to a tent.

602
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.631
No floors; it was really
kind of nomadic conditions.

603
00:33:44.718 --> 00:33:47.547
We spent six months
living in the tents.

604
00:33:47.634 --> 00:33:49.679
Me and Holliday.
the flight engineer.

605
00:33:49.766 --> 00:33:51.899
always slept in the plane.
and Sam.

606
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:54.815
Well. old Sam Zuck was a mechanic. he was a good one.

607
00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:56.643
So they assigned him
to our plane.

608
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.471
And so wherever we'’d land.

609
00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:00.908
Sam was always going around
working on the plane.

610
00:34:00.995 --> 00:34:02.605
Me and Holliday had been up

611
00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:04.825
most of the night
playing poker somewhere.

612
00:34:04.912 --> 00:34:06.522
And Sam. he'’d get up while me

613
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.481
and the flight engineer
was trying to sleep.

614
00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:10.309
and he'’d start working
on the plane.

615
00:34:10.396 --> 00:34:12.746
And he'’d be hammering. and that plane is just like a drum.

616
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.922
When you'’d beat on the side.
it reverberates.

617
00:34:15.009 --> 00:34:17.011
and the flight engineer
told Sam. he said.

618
00:34:17.098 --> 00:34:18.795
"Sam. why don'’t you
knock that off?

619
00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:20.710
We can let that go
to some other time."

620
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:23.452
But old Sam wasn'’t that way.
Sam was conscientious.

621
00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:25.628
And Holliday. he said.
"Sam. damn it.

622
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:28.762
I gave you a direct order
to go back to bed."

623
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:30.111
I couldn'’t stand it.
I laughed.

624
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.298
We got eight new B-17s

625
00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.866
and was on Iwo Jima
till the war ended.

626
00:34:45.953 --> 00:34:49.043
I was a radio operator
on Bulgin'’ Bessie.

627
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.133
We would go
on standby offshore

628
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.657
so that if a crippled plane
come back.

629
00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:57.182
we had the boat on the B-17.

630
00:34:57.269 --> 00:34:59.445
We could drop a boat
or give assistance

631
00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:02.578
and call a submarine
or a rescue ship in

632
00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:04.232
to assist them.

633
00:35:04.319 --> 00:35:05.842
A lot of airplanes have ditched

634
00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:07.540
because of mechanical problems.

635
00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.281
A lot of them made it too.

636
00:35:09.368 --> 00:35:13.023
Kind of luck plays
a big part of that.

637
00:35:20.857 --> 00:35:25.427
My combat experiences began
on March 7th. 1945.

638
00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:28.996
when our squadron landed P-51s
on Iwo Jima.

639
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:31.390
We knew that there were Dumbos.

640
00:35:31.477 --> 00:35:33.435
PBYs flown by
the Army Air Corps.

641
00:35:33.522 --> 00:35:36.090
and the Navy.
on the way to Japan.

642
00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:38.048
The next group were
the destroyers

643
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.702
on top of the ocean.

644
00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:41.748
And the next group were
the submarines.

645
00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:43.967
And yes. we knew
that they were out there.

646
00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:46.361
We had code words for them.
We named them something.

647
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:47.928
And we used them.

648
00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:50.235
My father was Hiram Cassedy.

649
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:53.499
He was a submarine commander
in the Pacific

650
00:35:53.586 --> 00:35:56.197
and he took command
of the Tigrone.

651
00:35:56.284 --> 00:35:58.460
When the Tigrone
was commissioned.

652
00:35:58.547 --> 00:36:00.506
Hiram was put in charge

653
00:36:00.593 --> 00:36:05.380
of the whole lifeguard rescue
operation in the South Pacific.

654
00:36:05.467 --> 00:36:08.688
When the pilots were coming
back from a mission.

655
00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:11.691
if they had been hit
and couldn'’t get the planes

656
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:14.563
back to base.
then they would coordinate

657
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.000
where they were going
to ditch the plane.

658
00:36:17.087 --> 00:36:21.440
and the sub would come up as close as they could to them

659
00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:24.573
and then rescue
the pilots and the crew.

660
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.880
This work was very dangerous

661
00:36:26.967 --> 00:36:30.536
because they were operating
in enemy waters.

662
00:36:30.623 --> 00:36:32.755
V Square 10 was the plane

663
00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:34.496
we flew overseas.

664
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:38.587
And it'’s got a name:
A-Broad with Eleven Yanks.

665
00:36:38.674 --> 00:36:42.330
You know. flying missions is kind of a harrowing experience.

666
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:45.551
There'’s 1.500 to 1.700 miles

667
00:36:45.638 --> 00:36:48.641
between Saipan
and the target area of Japan.

668
00:36:48.728 --> 00:36:51.731
And as far as we knew.
there'’s nothing between us

669
00:36:51.818 --> 00:36:53.211
but open ocean.

670
00:36:53.298 --> 00:36:55.082
We were on our way
to the target

671
00:36:55.169 --> 00:36:58.346
when the propeller ran away.
ran at high-speed.

672
00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:00.479
and we were not able
to control it.

673
00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:03.003
So we headed
for the island of Agrihan.

674
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.398
Just before we got there.
fire broke out on the engine.

675
00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:08.574
And when fire broke out.
we bailed out.

676
00:37:08.661 --> 00:37:11.620
We were at 3.000 feet at three o'’clock in the morning

677
00:37:11.707 --> 00:37:13.666
over the wide Pacific Ocean.

678
00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:16.408
but at least with an island
visible to us.

679
00:37:16.495 --> 00:37:18.801
I'’m sure we were all hanging
in our parachutes

680
00:37:18.888 --> 00:37:20.803
when the plane exploded

681
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.458
and crashed into the island
of Agrihan.

682
00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:26.983
Well after daylight.
a PBY flying boat flew over.

683
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.290
Little did I know
that they had been alerted

684
00:37:29.377 --> 00:37:31.118
and they came to search for us.

685
00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:33.120
The B-29 scattered itself

686
00:37:33.207 --> 00:37:35.209
across about a third
of the way up.

687
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:37.211
We circled in close.

688
00:37:37.298 --> 00:37:40.606
I never once
felt that we were all lost.

689
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:44.740
but I was extremely thankful when I saw the PBY flying over.

690
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:46.264
Twelve of us bailed out.

691
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:49.963
Unfortunately.
only 11 were picked up.

692
00:38:13.856 --> 00:38:17.164
So we got alongside of them.
and two of my crewmen.

693
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:19.253
they got a rope
to the life raft

694
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.908
and we were able to pull them
up to the aircraft.

695
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:24.345
and between all the men
on the crew.

696
00:38:24.432 --> 00:38:26.391
we were able to get
the three men in

697
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.610
through the blister
of the aircraft.

698
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:47.237
My name is Doug West.

699
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:48.891
I'’m the son
of Clyde Allen West.

700
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:51.111
He was a captain and pilot
of the B-29 bomber

701
00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:52.591
called Dragon Lady.

702
00:38:52.678 --> 00:38:54.332
It was actually
his final mission

703
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:56.986
and he was flying Dragon Lady
on a bombing mission over Japan.

704
00:38:57.073 --> 00:38:59.075
I'’m Steven Wilcoxon.
and I'’m the son

705
00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:00.773
of Roderick Gale Wilcoxon.

706
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.818
My dad was flying as co-pilot

707
00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:05.386
on the Dragon Lady
when she went down.

708
00:39:05.473 --> 00:39:10.609
In 1945. General LeMay.
of the 73rd Bomb Wing.

709
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:12.611
and all of the 20th Air Force.

710
00:39:12.698 --> 00:39:15.701
decreed that incendiary raids
should be carried out

711
00:39:15.788 --> 00:39:19.792
to successfully stop the production of war matériel.

712
00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:22.838
So incendiary bombing
was carried out.

713
00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:25.754
It was not a small thing to prep

714
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:28.278
one of those planes
for a mission like that.

715
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:31.456
It would start six to eight
hours before the mission.

716
00:39:31.543 --> 00:39:33.849
And those missions
were 15 to 18 hours long.

717
00:39:33.936 --> 00:39:35.895
That particular mission.
that was the Yokahama raid.

718
00:39:35.982 --> 00:39:37.766
They were flying off
of North Field Tinian.

719
00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:39.420
That was the same airfield

720
00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:42.118
that the Enola Gay
in the 509th set up.

721
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:44.338
On their way back. they encountered flak.

722
00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:46.253
and it damaged the plane.

723
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.386
The shell
that damaged them the most

724
00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:49.996
exploded right
under the cockpit.

725
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:52.172
and it started electrical fires in the airplane.

726
00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:54.392
and the airplane was also hit
in other places.

727
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:56.611
So. they were
pretty badly limping.

728
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:58.439
The plane was
an electronic airplane.

729
00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:02.312
and it was dependent
on the internal navigation.

730
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.314
radar. and electronic controls.

731
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.839
and if the electronic system
went out.

732
00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:08.710
then you couldn'’t control
the aircraft.

733
00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:10.625
They kept turning off
the electrical system.

734
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:12.975
and it was able to get
the fire to stop.

735
00:40:13.062 --> 00:40:15.151
but then whenever they tried
to turn it back on again.

736
00:40:15.238 --> 00:40:16.762
the fire started again.

737
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:18.459
The tail gunner apparently

738
00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:20.418
burned alive
because of the fire.

739
00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:21.897
-Wright!
-Everybody else is trying

740
00:40:21.984 --> 00:40:23.551
to put the fires out.
It'’s chaos.

741
00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:25.597
You have
no situational awareness

742
00:40:25.684 --> 00:40:27.599
outside the aircraft
and you don'’t know

743
00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:29.775
if you'’re going to be called on
to parachute

744
00:40:29.862 --> 00:40:32.995
or whether or not the pilot
is gonna put her down.

745
00:40:34.693 --> 00:40:38.218
So he decided
to ditch the airplane.

746
00:40:38.305 --> 00:40:40.263
You can feel your stomach
goes right up in your throat.

747
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.744
I mean. you can feel the plane
is going down like a stone.

748
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:44.877
Descending at 3.000 feet
per minute!

749
00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:47.532
That'’s a really rapid descent.

750
00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.403
It would be very close

751
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.231
to feeling as if you'’re
in free-fall.

752
00:40:51.318 --> 00:40:53.712
The noise and the vibration

753
00:40:53.799 --> 00:40:56.062
are just tremendous.
they'’re absolutely deafening.

754
00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:58.456
And you feel this
through your whole body.

755
00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:00.153
You want to put her down
tail-first.

756
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.459
smoothly hit the water.

757
00:41:01.546 --> 00:41:03.286
and you'’ve got
to keep her level.

758
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.119
When the plane crashed.

759
00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:11.860
several of the crewmen
were swept out.

760
00:41:11.947 --> 00:41:14.254
Two were lost
and never recovered.

761
00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:16.343
At that point.
because the ship was sinking.

762
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.301
they had to get on
to their life rafts.

763
00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:20.521
They weren'’t able to radio
anybody their location

764
00:41:20.608 --> 00:41:22.523
because the electrical equipment
had been out.

765
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.133
They could count on the fact
that somebody

766
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.613
was gonna be looking for them.

767
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.789
They just didn'’t know
how much information

768
00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:29.487
the rescuers would have
about them

769
00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:31.663
because their communications
had been cut off.

770
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.535
So they were out there floating
in the middle of the ocean

771
00:41:34.622 --> 00:41:36.581
probably thinking
that this could be the end.

772
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.844
that they didn'’t know whether
they were going to be rescued.

773
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:40.846
killed by a Japanese submarine

774
00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:43.196
or Zeros that may have seen them
and come in.

775
00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:46.416
You'’re at zero elevation
and everything is above you.

776
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.158
You know. the Queen Mary
could be a hundred yards away

777
00:41:49.245 --> 00:41:51.509
and if you weren'’t on the top
of one of the swells.

778
00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:52.771
you'’d never see it.

779
00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:54.729
So. it was a scary thing

780
00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:57.558
because you just don'’t know
how long you'’re gonna be.

781
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.083
How'’s Weaver?

782
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.085
We'’re out of morphine.

783
00:42:05.914 --> 00:42:09.178
She nosed over
too quick. Cap.

784
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:11.398
Couldn'’t get
to the provisions.

785
00:42:13.618 --> 00:42:16.359
James. any food
or water in that thing?

786
00:42:16.446 --> 00:42:17.839
Negative. Captain.

787
00:42:19.885 --> 00:42:22.235
How long do
these rafts stay afloat?

788
00:42:22.322 --> 00:42:24.367
They'’ll hold for a good
long while. Verdeschi.

789
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.587
Don'’t you worry.
We'’ll be on Tinian

790
00:42:26.674 --> 00:42:28.981
long before these rafts
give way.

791
00:43:23.862 --> 00:43:25.254
Sam.

792
00:43:26.778 --> 00:43:28.562
Sam!

793
00:43:30.172 --> 00:43:31.260
Sam!

794
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:33.480
Rise and shine. boys.

795
00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:35.917
Sam.
why don'’t you knock that off

796
00:43:36.004 --> 00:43:38.485
till another time?

797
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.098
You boys up all night
playin'’ poker again?

798
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:45.753
Samuel Zuck.
I'’m giving you a direct order!

799
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.103
Stop working!

800
00:43:50.802 --> 00:43:52.847
My cousin would never put up
with this.

801
00:43:52.934 --> 00:43:55.589
You know. the last time
you told that story.

802
00:43:55.676 --> 00:43:57.373
Doc Holliday was your uncle.

803
00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.898
Don'’t start with me. Chief.

804
00:43:59.985 --> 00:44:01.595
The operations officer.

805
00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:04.206
he got notice from whomever

806
00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:06.861
that this was down
or that was down.

807
00:44:06.948 --> 00:44:09.995
and he'’s the one that came
and notified us that.

808
00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.300
"You'’re on. go."

809
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.393
Sam! Lieutenant'’s on his way!

810
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.787
We'’re going up;
emergency search and rescue.

811
00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:23.182
Can you put that back on?

812
00:44:26.054 --> 00:44:27.882
Zalkan: B-29 ditched.

813
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:30.406
Last known position. Go ahead and plot us a course.

814
00:44:30.493 --> 00:44:31.886
They'’re in the water--
we'’re against the clock.

815
00:44:31.973 --> 00:44:33.671
Roger that.

816
00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:35.368
We gotta get those propsturned through.

817
00:44:35.455 --> 00:44:36.761
Sam!

818
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.514
Zuck. you breaking my plane?

819
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:52.951
No. sir.

820
00:44:53.038 --> 00:44:54.735
You still looking
for a change of scenery?

821
00:44:54.822 --> 00:44:56.302
-Yes. sir.
-When you'’re done there.

822
00:44:56.389 --> 00:44:57.477
come aboard.

823
00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:59.653
Yes. sir!

824
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.220
Thank you. sir!

825
00:45:26.506 --> 00:45:28.160
Radio check. radio check.

826
00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:29.901
-Tower check.
-Radio. copy.

827
00:45:29.988 --> 00:45:30.684
Navigator. check.

828
00:45:30.771 --> 00:45:32.294
Radar operator. copy.

829
00:45:33.774 --> 00:45:34.557
Doc. let'’s
get this thing running.

830
00:45:34.644 --> 00:45:35.994
Start on engine number one.

831
00:45:36.081 --> 00:45:38.561
Engineer to pilot. copy.
start on engine number one.

832
00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:48.920
Start on engine two.

833
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:51.444
Engineer to pilot. copy.
start on engine number two.

834
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.295
Walnut. this is Dumbo number one

835
00:46:16.382 --> 00:46:17.600
requesting clearance
for takeoff on Maple.

836
00:46:17.687 --> 00:46:19.385
emergency rescue. over.

837
00:46:19.472 --> 00:46:20.952
Copy. Dumbo.

838
00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:23.041
You are currently number one and cleared for takeoff. Maple.

839
00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:23.998
Over.

840
00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:25.217
Copy. tower.

841
00:46:29.003 --> 00:46:30.657
Pilot to crew.
prepare for takeoff.

842
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.951
Navigator to pilot.

843
00:47:04.038 --> 00:47:05.518
we'’ve reached their last known
position. over.

844
00:47:05.605 --> 00:47:07.215
Pilot to navigator. copy.

845
00:47:07.302 --> 00:47:08.347
Very nice work. Zalkan.

846
00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:10.566
Over.

847
00:47:10.653 --> 00:47:13.265
We'’re going to do an expanded
square search.

848
00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:14.440
They'’re out here somewhere.

849
00:47:14.527 --> 00:47:16.398
Lieutenant. we'’re well within
fighter range.

850
00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:16.921
We'’re going
to have to keep moving

851
00:47:17.008 --> 00:47:18.966
when we find them.

852
00:47:19.053 --> 00:47:20.446
If we find them.

853
00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:22.491
We'’re not leaving without them.
Lieutenant.

854
00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:24.667
It'’s very
difficult to find people

855
00:47:24.754 --> 00:47:26.626
in a small boat in the ocean.

856
00:47:26.713 --> 00:47:28.280
It'’s just a big ocean
out there.

857
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:30.238
and a lot of room.

858
00:47:30.325 --> 00:47:32.545
and if you make a pass
going east to west

859
00:47:32.632 --> 00:47:34.547
and turn around
and come back the other way.

860
00:47:34.634 --> 00:47:36.070
how close are you?

861
00:47:36.157 --> 00:47:40.292
Because you can'’t come back
a mile off or two miles off.

862
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:42.772
There were Japanese subs
in the area.

863
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.775
and the crew members
that he was trying to rescue

864
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:49.431
would not be surviving
by nightfall.

865
00:47:53.131 --> 00:47:54.480
Cap?

866
00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:55.916
What is it. Sparks?

867
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:59.398
Cap. you hear it?

868
00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:00.616
I think you'’re
hearing things. Cody.

869
00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:02.183
No.

870
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.533
No. I know that sound.

871
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.450
It'’s a twin engine.
synchronized.

872
00:48:08.537 --> 00:48:10.278
One of ours.

873
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:24.075
Hey. that'’s not funny!

874
00:48:24.162 --> 00:48:24.858
You know. you should
keep your mouth shut

875
00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:25.946
if you don'’t know
what you'’re talking about.

876
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:26.729
Why don'’t you shut
the hell up. Tancreti?

877
00:48:26.816 --> 00:48:27.687
We lost Wright.

878
00:48:27.774 --> 00:48:29.732
We already lost two guys!

879
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:31.778
And now you'’re hearing things?

880
00:48:31.865 --> 00:48:33.171
Come on! False hope
is worse than no hope!

881
00:48:33.258 --> 00:48:35.390
Don'’t give people
false hope!

882
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.156
Engineer to pilot.
I'’ve got eyes

883
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.376
on nine Davy Jones
in two Goodyears!

884
00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:06.378
Repeat: nine Davy Jones.
two Goodyears.

885
00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:07.553
Copy. Doc. We'’ve seen them.

886
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.858
Coming around for another pass.

887
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.773
What is the condition
of the crew? Over.

888
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.514
One appears to be critical.

889
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:13.951
The others. satisfactory. Over.

890
00:49:16.127 --> 00:49:17.519
How far out is
that Navy Lifeguard sub?

891
00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:20.000
ETA to Playmate. three hours.
at maximum speed.

892
00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:28.269
Pilot to crew.
prepare for water landing.

893
00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:31.098
Floats down. floats down.

894
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.666
Copy. floats down.
floats down. over!

895
00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:56.558
He made an open sea landing.

896
00:49:56.645 --> 00:49:57.646
which was prohibited.

897
00:49:57.733 --> 00:49:59.126
It was just too dangerous.

898
00:49:59.213 --> 00:50:02.390
He thought of others
before he thought of himself.

899
00:50:02.477 --> 00:50:04.218
We pulled up to the raft.

900
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:06.177
He was afraid
to kill the engine

901
00:50:06.264 --> 00:50:08.092
because we had to get out of
there as quick as we could.

902
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:11.356
And so the plane was always
moving forward.

903
00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:13.880
The life raft was floating
back under the plane.

904
00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:15.534
When we'’d come up.

905
00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:17.014
the tail of the plane would be
way out of the water

906
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.885
and then come down and slap.

907
00:50:18.972 --> 00:50:22.584
Well. it was beatin'’ those guys
to death in the raft.

908
00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:25.848
And so I had to lean out as far
as I could over the blister

909
00:50:25.935 --> 00:50:27.633
and pull the raft forward

910
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.809
against the motion of the plane

911
00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:30.505
Start climbing.

912
00:50:30.592 --> 00:50:31.985
Right over! Hurry!

913
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.423
Come on boys. go!

914
00:50:38.122 --> 00:50:38.992
Hold up!

915
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:41.734
Take my hand!

916
00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:49.263
Keep an eye out.

917
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.960
I'’m worried about Zeroes.

918
00:50:57.489 --> 00:50:58.925
Logan!

919
00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:00.535
Get those men on board!

920
00:51:00.622 --> 00:51:03.582
Double time. double time!

921
00:51:03.669 --> 00:51:05.366
-Watch his leg!
-Go. boys. go!

922
00:51:23.993 --> 00:51:25.821
-Pull him in!
-Got him!

923
00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:29.564
You'’re next!

924
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:30.913
I can'’t leave him.

925
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.481
We'’re not leaving
anyone! Lets go!

926
00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:35.353
We'’re not leaving you.

927
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.963
You hear me?

928
00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:51.369
Then we got down to the injured guy in the raft.

929
00:51:51.456 --> 00:51:53.327
You never saw such
a pitiful look on a guy'’s face

930
00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:54.981
in your life.

931
00:51:55.068 --> 00:51:58.419
He thought we'’s gonna go off
and leave him.

932
00:51:58.506 --> 00:51:59.681
What'’s your name. airman?

933
00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:02.249
Weaver. My name'’s Weaver.

934
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:03.120
All right. Weaver.

935
00:52:03.207 --> 00:52:04.512
I'’m Logan.

936
00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:05.992
I need you to work with me
for a minute.

937
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.602
Can you do that for me. Weaver?

938
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:09.082
I can'’t move.

939
00:52:09.169 --> 00:52:10.431
You have to leave me.

940
00:52:10.518 --> 00:52:11.693
We'’re not going to leaving you!

941
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.912
Go!

942
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:14.043
You listen to me!

943
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.175
We are all going home!

944
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:16.742
Do you understand me?

945
00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:31.365
Logan!

946
00:52:34.455 --> 00:52:36.762
Logan!

947
00:52:44.335 --> 00:52:47.555
-Hang on!
-Watch his head!

948
00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:26.845
And in the meantime.

949
00:55:26.932 --> 00:55:28.890
the radioman had been very busy searching for help

950
00:55:28.977 --> 00:55:30.588
and he got in touch
with a submarine.

951
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:32.285
the U.S.S. Tigrone.

952
00:55:32.372 --> 00:55:33.721
and I think
it took them an hour.

953
00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:35.332
or maybe a little more.

954
00:55:35.419 --> 00:55:37.769
to reach our destination.
which they did.

955
00:56:25.947 --> 00:56:27.819
Scheuch.

956
00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:29.037
You go on now.

957
00:56:29.124 --> 00:56:31.083
I can'’t. I...
I have to make sure

958
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:32.911
-everyone gets--
-Walter.

959
00:56:32.998 --> 00:56:36.175
I outrank you. son.

960
00:56:36.262 --> 00:56:39.526
They'’re going to ask
a lot of questions about today.

961
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:41.354
You just tell '’em
it was a direct order.

962
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:42.921
That I stayed with the ship.

963
00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:46.315
You go on with our skipper now.

964
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:49.623
Get him safely across.

965
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:51.669
Put his head to the back.

966
00:57:05.987 --> 00:57:08.337
They transported the pilot

967
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:11.123
from the plane to the sub
in a sling of some kind.

968
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.869
Then the front of the sub
pulled up to the plane wing.

969
00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:19.131
The nose of the sub was.
I want to say.

970
00:57:19.218 --> 00:57:21.829
about two or three feet
beyond the end of the wing.

971
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:23.265
To get on the sub.

972
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:26.399
we all climbed out one of the windows of the plane

973
00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:28.488
and made our way
out on the wing.

974
00:57:28.575 --> 00:57:32.274
As the swells came by.
we'’d go up and down.

975
00:57:32.361 --> 00:57:34.059
One moment.
the sub would be below us

976
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:35.713
and the next moment.

977
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.325
it'’d rise up above us
and then back down.

978
00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:42.284
Well. we walked out
on the end of the plane wing

979
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:45.636
and when the sub would start
coming up. we'’d jump on it.

980
00:57:45.723 --> 00:57:48.073
You had to time it just right.

981
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.989
You'’d go up and come back down
and the next guy'’d jump.

982
00:57:51.076 --> 00:57:54.383
All those men on the plane
made that transfer safely

983
00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.125
with no incident whatsoever.

984
00:57:57.212 --> 00:57:59.127
They'’d already taken
the wounded guy.

985
00:57:59.214 --> 00:58:00.346
Thank goodness
we found out later

986
00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:02.261
he didn'’t have a broken back.

987
00:58:02.348 --> 00:58:04.176
Come to find out.
he had a whole bunch of flesh

988
00:58:04.263 --> 00:58:06.831
gouged out of one thigh.

989
00:58:06.918 --> 00:58:11.009
They got him straightened around
pretty well.

990
00:58:11.096 --> 00:58:13.490
Being as I had been taking care of Lieutenant Stratton.

991
00:58:13.577 --> 00:58:15.840
I was next to the last man
off the plane.

992
00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:19.408
The last man was Captain Zalkan. our navigator.

993
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:22.281
But we all made it safe
and sound with no problems.

994
00:58:57.142 --> 00:58:59.274
We thought Stratton was as good a pilot as we could have.

995
00:58:59.361 --> 00:59:01.407
We thought he was
as good a pilot as there was

996
00:59:01.494 --> 00:59:02.843
in the organization.

997
00:59:32.264 --> 00:59:33.091
They surfaced.

998
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:35.354
it would have been
a formal burial at sea.

999
00:59:35.441 --> 00:59:37.356
Captain Cassedy.
the captain of the Tigrone.

1000
00:59:37.443 --> 00:59:39.967
he would read
the burial service.

1001
00:59:40.054 --> 00:59:43.667
and then the body will be slid
over the side of the ship.

1002
00:59:43.754 --> 00:59:45.494
with the crew at attention.

1003
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:48.106
Hiram took
things on the boat personally.

1004
00:59:48.193 --> 00:59:51.805
It was done with dignity.
respect. and love.

1005
01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:09.736
That was a record.

1006
01:00:09.823 --> 01:00:12.304
That was the most pilots
and aircrew rescued

1007
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:14.262
by any lifeguard submarine.

1008
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:17.048
The sub put them ashore
on Iwo Jima on June the 1st.

1009
01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:20.051
And there'’s a picture of them
on the deck of the Tigrone

1010
01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:21.879
when she pulled into Iwo Jima

1011
01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:24.185
and there was a famous
radio transmission

1012
01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:27.754
that Cassedy had sent after he
had left his lifeguard station

1013
01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:31.105
to Commander in Chief.
submarines. and said.

1014
01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:34.152
"Tigrone has saved the Air Force
and is returning to Iwo Jima

1015
01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:36.371
with 28 Zoomies."

1016
01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:38.330
We'’d come back from a mission
one time

1017
01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:41.420
and there was a large group
of people around a tent.

1018
01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:44.553
One of the survivors was
telling us what had happened.

1019
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.860
I got to talk to John Logan.

1020
01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:50.124
who was a member
of that crew who witnessed

1021
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:53.301
all that horrendous stuff.

1022
01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.651
No good.

1023
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.089
No good.

1024
01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:03.094
We were transferred to Iwo Jima in May of 1945.

1025
01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:05.923
We learned that we were
replacing a crew

1026
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.577
that their service
had been lost.

1027
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:12.320
and this crew was headed
by Lieutenant Royal Stratton

1028
01:01:12.407 --> 01:01:16.107
and was killed
in that operation.

1029
01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:18.326
I wanted to get down
to where the action was.

1030
01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:22.243
And I got the opportunity
to volunteer as a co-pilot

1031
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.463
in the 4th Emergency
Rescue Squadron.

1032
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.117
And I didn'’t want to be
a co-pilot.

1033
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.423
but that'’s the way
it all worked out.

1034
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.338
In the long view of things.

1035
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:33.167
probably it was the best thing
that ever happened to me!

1036
01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:36.257
So I was assigned
to Captain Richardson'’s crew.

1037
01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:38.390
and that very hour.

1038
01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.827
I was on a plane
headed for Iwo Jima.

1039
01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:44.483
I noticed that he had me sit
in the pilot seat.

1040
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.006
Well. I didn'’t realize it
at the time.

1041
01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:48.574
but later. I found out
the reason that I flew

1042
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.358
in the pilot seat is because

1043
01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:51.925
when the prop comes off
of that motor.

1044
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.014
it comes and kills the pilot.

1045
01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:57.757
So. Bud and I became great
friends later on after the war

1046
01:01:57.844 --> 01:02:01.456
and I never ceased to remind him
of that fact.

1047
01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:03.415
And he always blushed up
and said.

1048
01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:05.678
"Well. you were last in."

1049
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:13.512
It was the 3rd of July. 1945.

1050
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:16.733
I always remember it because
I say I got my fireworks

1051
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.996
a day early.

1052
01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:20.388
I'’ll never forget that day.

1053
01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:25.437
It was---it was. uh.
it wasn'’t good at all.

1054
01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:26.830
I was a squadron leader

1055
01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.919
on a mission over Chichijima.

1056
01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:30.442
Richard Schroeppel.

1057
01:02:30.529 --> 01:02:31.965
Dick Schroeppel
from Ridgewood. New Jersey.

1058
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:34.098
was my wingman.

1059
01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:36.100
And I gave a waggle
and we all strung out

1060
01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:37.841
in a string formation.

1061
01:02:37.928 --> 01:02:40.278
turned our airplanes over.
and went down and dropped

1062
01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:44.021
500-pound bombs
on the Japanese landing strip

1063
01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:45.805
on Chichijima.

1064
01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.720
And they were
shooting at me first.

1065
01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.678
but they hit Dick Schroeppel.

1066
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.856
And he got up and bailed out.
got into a one-man life raft.

1067
01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.248
got out to sea a little bit.

1068
01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:56.076
We called for a Dumbo.

1069
01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:58.339
There was anti-aircraft on both sides

1070
01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:00.211
where you went in to this bay.

1071
01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:03.649
Well. he was down inside the bay
in his little dinghy.

1072
01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.782
and we got the boat
down to him.

1073
01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:09.524
and the Japanese
were all firing at him

1074
01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:11.526
and firing at us.

1075
01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.093
We were called there.

1076
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.703
but by the time we got there.

1077
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.532
another B-17
had dropped his boat.

1078
01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:19.970
We could see flashes
from the shore.

1079
01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:22.494
An Army PBY landed

1080
01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.409
with a flight surgeon in it.

1081
01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:26.193
Of course I was a co-pilot.

1082
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.022
but that was the first time
I'’d ever landed in a PBY.

1083
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:31.024
I had no experience.

1084
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.722
To tell you the truth.
I thought we were sinking.

1085
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.289
He saw the rescue boat

1086
01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:36.987
that was dropped by the B-17.

1087
01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.597
The only thing that I regret.

1088
01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:40.817
we didn'’t get the guy.

1089
01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.819
And that. of course. haunts me.

1090
01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:44.864
He had been killed.

1091
01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:47.475
and the squadron
that replaced my squadron

1092
01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:49.608
were ordered
to use rockets to sink

1093
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:53.873
that rescue lifeboat with
Dick Schroeppel'’s body in it

1094
01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.876
so that the commanding officer of Chichijima

1095
01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:59.052
wouldn'’t have
another liver to eat.

1096
01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:03.100
of which he was accused
of doing after the war.

1097
01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.753
It was a bad day.

1098
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.757
We were just fortunate that we
got out of there and back to Iwo

1099
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.672
without any more problems.

1100
01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:12.718
We had some holes in the plane

1101
01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:15.721
but they didn'’t happen to hit
anything vital

1102
01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.549
that knocked us down

1103
01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:21.335
or we'’d have been
right down there with him.

1104
01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:23.424
July the 30th. 1945.

1105
01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:24.425
the ship was sunk.

1106
01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:27.733
I first went aboard
in February 1942.

1107
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.345
My name is Lyle Umenhoffer.
I was Seaman First Class.

1108
01:04:31.432 --> 01:04:34.435
and I served aboard
the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

1109
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.785
My station was the last one
on the back of the ship.

1110
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.962
The eight-inch guns back aft.

1111
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.877
that'’s where I went in
to be a gunner'’s mate.

1112
01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.879
Well. they took us over
to Hunter'’s Point.

1113
01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.316
This huge. big crate
was sitting on the dock.

1114
01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:47.187
So we loaded it aboard ship

1115
01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.233
and put a Marine guard
on the door.

1116
01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:03.247
Well. we had no idea what it was
or anything like that.

1117
01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.292
MacArthur was over there
for a while.

1118
01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:07.468
and they thought maybe it was
a load of toilet paper

1119
01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.340
or something
to take to MacArthur.

1120
01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.689
Even on Saipan.

1121
01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:13.648
we didn'’t know anything
about the mission.

1122
01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:16.042
We went to
Guam and we took on ammunition

1123
01:05:16.129 --> 01:05:17.957
and supplies and things.

1124
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:20.786
We left out and the captain
requested escort

1125
01:05:20.873 --> 01:05:22.657
and they turned him down.

1126
01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:25.051
so we were by ourselves
out in the Philippine Sea.

1127
01:05:25.138 --> 01:05:25.965
And that evening.

1128
01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.663
I had just got off watch
at 12:00.

1129
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.884
When the first torpedo hit.
it blew off our bow.

1130
01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:33.668
And then when
the second torpedo hit.

1131
01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.757
it hit in our
high-octane gasoline

1132
01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:38.238
in one of our powder rooms
where we kept our powder

1133
01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:39.587
for our ammunition.

1134
01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.589
And it exploded and sent fire

1135
01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:42.764
all through the front
of the ship.

1136
01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:46.159
It was about 12 minutes after
midnight when we got hit

1137
01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:48.988
and I went in the water
and I didn'’t see anybody

1138
01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:51.034
until about 6:00
the next morning.

1139
01:05:51.121 --> 01:05:53.253
There was thousands
and thousands of sharks

1140
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.342
just milling around.

1141
01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:56.953
and barracuda.

1142
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.563
We could see '’em.
and they were picking guys

1143
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.304
that was off by themselves.

1144
01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:02.045
They were just taking them
real quick.

1145
01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:03.742
There'’s no sound out there.

1146
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:06.049
just a little. maybe.
chopping of a wave.

1147
01:06:06.136 --> 01:06:07.441
or something like that.

1148
01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:10.836
But then of course.
there was guys talking

1149
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:13.491
and crying and praying--

1150
01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:15.493
we were out there
for five days.

1151
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.278
So we just kept hanging on.
saying. well.

1152
01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:20.541
maybe somebody will spot us.

1153
01:06:20.628 --> 01:06:22.587
No water. no food.

1154
01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:24.589
The Navy didn'’t report

1155
01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:27.200
theU.S.S. Indianapolis missing

1156
01:06:27.287 --> 01:06:29.681
until three days later.

1157
01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:30.987
The fourth day.

1158
01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:33.467
Wilbur Gwinn and his crew.
based on Tinian.

1159
01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:36.079
they were out
to spot submarines.

1160
01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.950
They had put an antenna
on the back of the plane

1161
01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:39.082
and it broke off.

1162
01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:40.953
So they went back in
and picked up another one

1163
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.389
and came back out again.

1164
01:06:42.476 --> 01:06:43.521
It started acting up.

1165
01:06:43.608 --> 01:06:46.306
so Wilbur Gwinn.
he went back aft and he said.

1166
01:06:46.393 --> 01:06:47.699
"Let me take a look at this."

1167
01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.483
They had the bomb bay doors
open.

1168
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.921
He looked down and he saw
an oil slick. which was us.

1169
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.402
And he spotted the heads
bobbing up and down.

1170
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:57.622
we were splashing
and everything.

1171
01:06:57.709 --> 01:06:59.537
and he said.
"There'’s men in the water."

1172
01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:01.539
So he radioed back in.

1173
01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:04.672
Lieutenant Adrian Marks.
his crew was standing by.

1174
01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:07.719
so he and his crew
jumped in the PBY

1175
01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:09.677
and flew in
and he saw sharks.

1176
01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:11.723
so he made an open-sea landing.

1177
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:13.638
And he bounced
a couple of times.

1178
01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:15.509
popped holes in the plane.

1179
01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:18.817
and they plugged them up
and started taxiing around

1180
01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:22.342
and started picking up survivors
just one at a time.

1181
01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:24.431
We were on Peleliu. flight D.

1182
01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:27.434
As a flight leader.
I was able to dispatch

1183
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:29.393
all three of our airplanes.

1184
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.657
Lieutenant Richard C. Alcorn
went to the northwest.

1185
01:07:32.744 --> 01:07:34.615
my aircraft went west.

1186
01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:37.705
and Lieutenant Willy Emonds
went to the southwest.

1187
01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:40.186
Lieutenant Alcorn found them.

1188
01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:42.841
He landed. and the survivors
had been in the water

1189
01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:44.234
withoutrafts.

1190
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:47.541
He threw them rafts
full of water and canned food.

1191
01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:49.282
or rations. rather.

1192
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:52.198
Some of them ended up
in rubber rafts. floundering.

1193
01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:56.420
and I swam out and grabbed it
and swam to our airplane.

1194
01:07:56.507 --> 01:07:59.727
The surface craft reached them
a little bit just before dark.

1195
01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:06.560
I was
picked up probably about 8:00

1196
01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.171
from the PBY.

1197
01:08:08.258 --> 01:08:10.303
and that'’s when they sent
a boat overto pick us up

1198
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.305
from the U.S.S. Cecil Doyle.

1199
01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:36.547
We didn'’t know anything

1200
01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:38.070
about the atomic bomb.

1201
01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:39.811
It was a well-kept secret.

1202
01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.552
We didn'’t even know
what the mission was.

1203
01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.336
but they called a mission.

1204
01:08:43.423 --> 01:08:45.860
and we took off.
5:00 in the morning.

1205
01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:47.775
and we had number one station.

1206
01:08:47.862 --> 01:08:49.995
which is right off
the coast of Japan.

1207
01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.170
It was a beautiful day.

1208
01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:54.347
It was clear blue sky.
maybe a cloud here and there

1209
01:08:54.434 --> 01:08:55.348
once in a while.

1210
01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:57.785
Smooth sailing.
and we was going along there.

1211
01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.700
and all of a sudden. George.

1212
01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:02.181
radio operator
that sat across from me.

1213
01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:05.315
he looked out the window
and he see this cloud coming up

1214
01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:08.405
And he said.
"What the hell was that?"

1215
01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:11.538
And I stood up
and looked out the top hatch.

1216
01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:14.324
and you could see this flower
getting bigger and bigger

1217
01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:15.238
and bigger.

1218
01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:16.848
We didn'’t see the flash

1219
01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:19.242
'’cause I don'’t think
we were that close.

1220
01:09:19.329 --> 01:09:23.985
I do recall we felt the shock
of it blowing out.

1221
01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:25.291
It just come over the radio

1222
01:09:25.378 --> 01:09:27.206
a short time later

1223
01:09:27.293 --> 01:09:30.427
that it was what they called
the atomic bomb.

1224
01:09:30.514 --> 01:09:34.561
It was horrendous.

1225
01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:36.172
We didn'’t know at the time

1226
01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:40.828
how many thousands of people
it had killed. but...

1227
01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:44.441
it was just something
I was not very proud of.

1228
01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:46.459
On August 15th.

1229
01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:48.331
at about 10:00
in the morning.

1230
01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:51.856
we got the notice that
the Japanese had surrendered.

1231
01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:54.380
I have received this afternoon

1232
01:10:54.467 --> 01:10:57.122
a message from
the Japanese government

1233
01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.951
in reply to the message
forwarded to that government

1234
01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:03.607
by the Secretary of State
on August 11th.

1235
01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:06.349
I deem this reply
a full acceptance

1236
01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:09.177
of the Potsdam Declaration.

1237
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.963
which specifies
the unconditional surrender

1238
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.225
of Japan.

1239
01:11:47.694 --> 01:11:50.480
He got to about
maybe 50 yards.

1240
01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:54.135
I could see the pilot as clearly
as I'’m looking at you.

1241
01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:57.356
I thought sure that
this was the end of my life.

1242
01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:59.053
Just at that point.

1243
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.317
one of the shells
from the destroyer

1244
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.581
must have hit the bomb this kamikaze was flying with.

1245
01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:07.235
it just blew up
in a huge ball of flame.

1246
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.412
I didn'’t even see the wreckage.

1247
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:13.024
That was my most
frightening experience.

1248
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:15.896
More so than
landing in Tokyo Bay.

1249
01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:17.637
I was up at Japan

1250
01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:19.552
when Admiral Halsey
came on and said

1251
01:12:19.639 --> 01:12:21.815
for all pilots
to return to base.

1252
01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:23.339
that the war was over

1253
01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:24.992
and the Japanese
had surrendered.

1254
01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:27.255
And then.
one of the worst six hours

1255
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.127
of my life of flying.

1256
01:12:29.214 --> 01:12:31.347
My father had taken me
to see the movie

1257
01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:34.001
All Quiet on the Western Front.

1258
01:12:34.088 --> 01:12:37.135
where the guy gets plugged
the last day of the war.

1259
01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:39.224
And I thought. oh shit.

1260
01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:40.356
this is going to happen.

1261
01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:41.357
we'’re going to get lost.

1262
01:12:41.444 --> 01:12:43.184
something bad
is gonna happen.

1263
01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:46.057
And that'’s the way I thought
all the way back to Iwo.

1264
01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:47.450
Near the end of the war.

1265
01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:52.280
we lost one aircraft
with seven guys.

1266
01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.021
Shot down.

1267
01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:56.633
It hit us pretty bad.

1268
01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.811
Particularly when just hours
away from the end of the war.

1269
01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:04.249
The last plane shot down
in World War II was a PBY.

1270
01:13:04.336 --> 01:13:07.992
4th Emergency Rescue Squadron
in Tokyo Bay.

1271
01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:16.957
We got a mission
to fly a courier

1272
01:13:17.044 --> 01:13:18.829
to the battleship Missouri.

1273
01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:22.963
The courier was carrying
the surrender documents.

1274
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.662
I was co-pilot on that flight.

1275
01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.925
Charles Oates was the pilot.

1276
01:13:28.012 --> 01:13:30.884
The courier and I
decided to play cribbage

1277
01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:32.103
on the way.

1278
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.106
I could see the outline
of the document binders

1279
01:13:35.193 --> 01:13:37.151
in his mailbag.

1280
01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:40.720
The courier wouldn'’t let go of that bag the entire flight.

1281
01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:44.115
obviously for good reason.

1282
01:13:44.202 --> 01:13:47.248
We are gathered here.

1283
01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:53.211
representatives
of the major warring powers.

1284
01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:57.563
to conclude a solemn agreement

1285
01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:01.828
whereby peace may be restored.

1286
01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:09.314
The issues involving divergent
ideals and ideologies

1287
01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:14.450
have been determined on
the battlefields of the world.

1288
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:06.110
I announce it my firm purpose.

1289
01:15:06.197 --> 01:15:09.766
in the tradition
of the countries I represent.

1290
01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:13.509
to proceed in the discharge
of my responsibilities.

1291
01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.685
with justice and tolerance.

1292
01:15:15.772 --> 01:15:19.340
while taking
all necessary dispositions

1293
01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:23.083
to ensure
that the terms of surrender

1294
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:28.132
are fully. promptly.
and faithfully complied with.

1295
01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:31.178
We didn'’t dream

1296
01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:33.093
of anybody getting killed.

1297
01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.182
We were friends.

1298
01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:37.358
When you lose a friend.

1299
01:15:37.445 --> 01:15:40.361
you lose a part of yourself.

1300
01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:44.278
We had built a theater on Saipan

1301
01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:46.324
where we could
watch movies at night

1302
01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:49.109
and named it the Stratton Memorial Theater.

1303
01:15:49.196 --> 01:15:52.025
which proved what
the gentlemen of the squadron

1304
01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:54.811
felt about Royal.

1305
01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:55.942
Unfortunately. he lost his life

1306
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:58.249
But it'’s because of that
that I'’m here today.

1307
01:15:58.336 --> 01:15:59.946
my family is here.

1308
01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:01.121
several generations
of family are here

1309
01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:03.602
because of the efforts
of Stratton and his crew.

1310
01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:05.343
So. words escape me

1311
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.867
as to the gratitude I have
for the gentleman.

1312
01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:11.349
Understanding that dynamic
of the young soldier.

1313
01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:14.570
the hero is born
just from circumstance.

1314
01:16:14.657 --> 01:16:16.876
He'’s pushed into a circumstance.

1315
01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:19.836
It'’s the decision
he makes at that moment

1316
01:16:19.923 --> 01:16:21.533
that makes him the hero.

1317
01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.492
And some of them don'’t survive
those decisions.

1318
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.624
I'’m here.

1319
01:16:25.711 --> 01:16:27.539
I was born in '’52.

1320
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.281
I was born way after this event.

1321
01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:32.109
so I'’m lucky to be here.

1322
01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:34.502
and I'’m lucky
that the legacy goes on

1323
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.331
and that these things are
documented and we remember.

1324
01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:39.420
You know. when somebody is
taken away from you so young.

1325
01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:42.467
that'’s the way you remember them
forever.

1326
01:16:42.554 --> 01:16:44.208
You don'’t see '’em
getting old and cranky

1327
01:16:44.295 --> 01:16:46.819
and losing their hair.

1328
01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:50.823
You know. he was always 22
in her mind.

1329
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:55.698
It'’s hard to imagine
the reverberations of.

1330
01:16:55.785 --> 01:16:57.830
of somebody. you know.

1331
01:16:57.917 --> 01:17:00.441
a very beloved family member.
a community member.

1332
01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:04.097
a friend
that is not here anymore.

1333
01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:08.493
My son was killed in Iraq
in April of 2004.

1334
01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.191
The Cindy Sheehan
that existed on April 3rd

1335
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:13.803
didn'’t exist on April 4th.

1336
01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.674
It was a totally
different person.

1337
01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.807
We got the knock on the door.

1338
01:17:17.894 --> 01:17:21.071
and the Army came to tell us
that Casey was killed.

1339
01:17:21.158 --> 01:17:24.683
I fell on the floor screaming
for I don'’t know how long.

1340
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.251
until my head hurt.
until my heart hurt.

1341
01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:28.861
and when I got up.
I was a different person.

1342
01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:30.733
How could I not be?

1343
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.604
I'’m sorry.

1344
01:17:34.824 --> 01:17:38.915
One of my
limbs was amputated.

1345
01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:43.789
What is hard
is to see how my mom reacted.

1346
01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:47.227
She never got over
the death of my dad. ever.

1347
01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.229
You'’d mention his name
and she'’d start crying.

1348
01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:50.535
so it was something

1349
01:17:50.622 --> 01:17:53.103
that I never really
wanted to get to.

1350
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.889
because it just tore her up
too much.

1351
01:17:56.976 --> 01:17:59.892
She loved him
till the day she died.

1352
01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:03.026
I like
that old saying thatsays

1353
01:18:03.113 --> 01:18:06.116
a person never dies
until the last person

1354
01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:08.248
that remembers that person dies.

1355
01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:10.468
So I don'’t think
Casey'’s ever gonna die.

1356
01:18:10.555 --> 01:18:14.951
His story and our story
is written up in history books

1357
01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:17.693
and has made that--

1358
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.044
that Casey is actually immortal.

1359
01:18:23.568 --> 01:18:26.963
It'’s Congress'’s responsibility

1360
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.182
and our honor
to call attention to those

1361
01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:32.969
who have given meritorious
service to our country.

1362
01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:36.407
And certainly. the Congress
recognize the importance

1363
01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:39.758
of those who have served
in World War II.

1364
01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:42.239
We'’ve honored them
with a special memorial.

1365
01:18:42.326 --> 01:18:45.068
and we know
that those who served

1366
01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:47.244
are in some ways.

1367
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:49.115
many of them
are starting to answer

1368
01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:51.814
their last call of duty.

1369
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:54.642
and we want to take
every opportunity

1370
01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.166
to be able to come forward

1371
01:18:56.253 --> 01:18:58.516
for those individuals
who have served

1372
01:18:58.603 --> 01:19:00.387
and pay them
special recognition.

1373
01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:03.695
We rise in honor
of World War II rescue pilot

1374
01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:06.002
1st Lieutenant Royal Stratton.

1375
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:08.700
who died May 29th. 1945.

1376
01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:11.659
after being mortally wounded while saving nine crew members

1377
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.966
from a downed B-29.

1378
01:19:14.053 --> 01:19:16.664
Royal hailed from
Ellwood City. Pennsylvania.

1379
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.536
His love of flying
led to his enlistment

1380
01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:20.277
in the Army Air Corps.

1381
01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:22.670
where he excelled to become
one of the few pilots

1382
01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.585
to wear both
Army and Navy wings.

1383
01:19:24.672 --> 01:19:27.545
Royal joined the
4th Emergency Rescue Squadron.

1384
01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:29.242
With his crew of six.

1385
01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:31.462
he'’d fly off Iwo Jima
and police flight paths

1386
01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:34.682
searching for B-29 bombers
in jeopardy.

1387
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.293
Generations have passed

1388
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.426
since the members of the
4th Emergency Rescue Squadron

1389
01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:41.951
set foot on these shores.

1390
01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:46.738
It doesn'’t seem that long ago
that they started out

1391
01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:49.001
on their journey

1392
01:19:49.088 --> 01:19:54.441
and faced
an entire world at war.

1393
01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:57.793
This remote island of Iwo Jima is the last place on earth

1394
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.319
a pilot from Pennsylvania. and many others. would set foot

1395
01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:03.929
and it'’s this hallowed ground

1396
01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:06.932
I'’ve chosen as the last stop
on my journey as well.

1397
01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:14.679
Here. atop Mount Suribachi.

1398
01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:18.074
I'’m alone with the memory
of those brave individuals

1399
01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:21.207
who forever set aside everything they could have been

1400
01:20:21.294 --> 01:20:23.644
in the name of freedom.

1401
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:25.951
and they changed the world.

1402
01:20:33.611 --> 01:20:38.007
Many of us didn'’t know
my great uncle. just a name:

1403
01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:41.445
Royal A. Stratton.

1404
01:20:41.532 --> 01:20:44.491
He was one among millions.

1405
01:20:44.578 --> 01:20:46.058
But he was ours.

1406
01:20:48.713 --> 01:20:50.846
I think back fondly about all the roads I'’ve taken

1407
01:20:50.933 --> 01:20:55.415
on this long journey
reaching back through time.

1408
01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:59.376
But in all my travels.
I'’ve found none so cherished

1409
01:20:59.463 --> 01:21:01.421
as the road that leads us home.

1410
01:21:01.508 --> 01:21:04.033
Floats up.

1411
01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.512
We'’re going home.

1412
01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:36.065
look back to you

1413
01:21:39.764 --> 01:21:41.766
we see the light

1414
01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:45.248
dispels the night

1415
01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:03.962
in truth and love

1416
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:10.795
we are one family

1417
01:22:10.882 --> 01:22:15.017
we are one tribe united

1418
01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:23.503
my greatest joy

1419
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:28.813
we are one family

1420
01:22:36.821 --> 01:22:38.649
It'’s been
a good life that we'’ve had.

1421
01:22:38.736 --> 01:22:40.999
We'’ve had positive experiences.

1422
01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:43.219
we'’ve had a positive attitude.

1423
01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:44.655
What legacy
do we want to leave behind.

1424
01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:45.873
you know?

1425
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.572
We want to leave a legacy
of peace and harmony

1426
01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:50.313
all over the world.

1427
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.880
I just wanted to do my part.

1428
01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.362
I tried my best to do
everything they asked of me.

1429
01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:59.452
and. uh. I got through.

1430
01:22:59.539 --> 01:23:01.106
We were out there to save lives

1431
01:23:01.193 --> 01:23:03.456
rather than to take lives.

1432
01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.458
Feels great knowing that we were

1433
01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:09.767
part of a group
trying to rescue survivors.

1434
01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:12.335
You can'’t imagine the feeling
that you have inside.

1435
01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:15.816
that you and these men
saved those lives.

1436
01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:18.123
Everyone took pride in what they did

1437
01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:20.560
and it'’s a real happy feeling.

1438
01:23:25.174 --> 01:23:27.393
I'’ve had a terrific life.

1439
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.570
I wouldn'’t trade anybody
for mine.

1440
01:23:30.657 --> 01:23:33.138
Well. you don'’t salute without your hat.
