00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.208
[Jacob] None of us were.

175
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:33.541
[choir singing festive music]

176
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:40.708
-They're good!
-[Ellie laughs]

177
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.791
-Oh. wonderful.
-[Jacob] That's sweet. Thank you.

178
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:47.000
-[Ellie] Bye-bye now.
-Bye.

179
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.208
Hey. are you still painting?

180
00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:51.125
You might as well
ask if I'm still breathing.

181
00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:54.708
Listen. I'm glad I ran into you.
It's good to see you.

182
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:57.083
I'm about ready to take off. I gotta. um…

183
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.708
I gotta come back tomorrow
and tackle another room.

184
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:04.000
It's gotta be really.
really hard going through all her stuff.

185
00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:07.625
Yeah. What was it
that Robert Frost always said?

186
00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.541
He said. "The best way out
is always through." right?

187
00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.958
Although I'm pretty sure
he never met a hoarder.

188
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:16.250
I would imagine not.

189
00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.916
[bittersweet music playing]

190
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.666
[Jacob] It's lonely out here.

191
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.833
And I miss you.

192
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.791
[sighs]

193
00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:04.666
[bittersweet music continues]

194
00:14:37.875 --> 00:14:39.250
Oh. God! Oh. come on!

195
00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:40.250
[Ava barking]

196
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.375
Oh. come on. Mom. really?

197
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.083
-What?
-[Ava whines]

198
00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:11.208
[intriguing music playing]

199
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.625
[playing soft melody]

200
00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:46.125
[knock on door]

201
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:51.333
Still like a grilled cheese
with tomato soup?

202
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:55.041
I figured you'd probably worked up
a pretty good appetite by now.

203
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.416
You kidding? I'm starving.

204
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.833
-Does she like tomato soup? Is this okay?
-She loves it. Yeah. Yeah. it's great.

205
00:15:59.916 --> 00:16:00.958
[Ellie] Oh. there you go.

206
00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.541
-Oh. she does!
-Look at that!

207
00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:07.916
We don't know how to thank you.
Do we. Ava?

208
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.708
-You could put me in your next novel.
-Whoa. whoa. hold on a second.

209
00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:13.500
You actually read my novels?

210
00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:17.416
I'm probably the only one of your readers
who can recognize some of the characters.

211
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.791
Like whom. for instance?

212
00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:21.791
-Well. in Green Eyes.
-Green Eyes of Paris.

213
00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:23.291
Yeah. the photographer.

214
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.083
Beautiful. strong woman
who has a breakdown.

215
00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:28.791
Well. that one's pretty obvious.
though. right?

216
00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:33.000
There's another character I recognize.
you know. in The Final Midnight.

217
00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:34.458
The father of the soldier.

218
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:37.625
Very minor character. though.
Sort of like in real life.

219
00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:41.125
Your memories of him can't be all that bad
if you're still wearing his watch.

220
00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:46.833
He came to your mother's funeral.
Did you know that?

221
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:51.375
To pay his respects. but I'm pretty sure
he was hoping to see you there.

222
00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.208
No. I don't…

223
00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:56.625
I don't think so. no.

224
00:16:56.708 --> 00:16:59.000
And the funeral… the funeral. I feel…

225
00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:02.791
It's understandable.
but it doesn't matter anymore.

226
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:04.875
That was then. This is now.

227
00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:06.500
Thanks.

228
00:17:07.083 --> 00:17:10.000
-[Ellie] And can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

229
00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:13.125
-It's personal.
-Sure.

230
00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:15.500
[Ellie] Um…

231
00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:17.875
Am I too old for this?

232
00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:20.333
[Jake laughs] Are--

233
00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.083
-This is your question?
-Yes.

234
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:23.916
No! No.

235
00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:26.041
-Seriously?
-This is perfect.

236
00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:28.875
Have you tried one of these?
Of course not. Why would you?

237
00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.750
You got women linin' up on your doorstep.

238
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.666
[laughing] I do not have women
lining up on my doorstep.

239
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.958
I see those magazines at the supermarket.
You date movie stars.

240
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.333
[laughing] All right.
Listen. they will print anything.

241
00:17:40.416 --> 00:17:43.041
But the answer to your question.
no. I have not tried a dating app.

242
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.750
but I think you absolutely should.

243
00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:46.083
I have to write something.

244
00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.291
-Dating profile?
-Yeah.

245
00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:49.208
I know a writer. May I?

246
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.458
-You're gonna write my profile? Oh!
-It would be my pleasure.

247
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.083
Hmm.

248
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:17.125
[emotional music playing]

249
00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:53.250
-[knock on door]
-Come on in. Ellie. Door's open.

250
00:18:57.833 --> 00:18:59.583
-Hello?
-You're not Ellie.

251
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.458
Uh. no. No. I'm not.

252
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.375
No. it's just--
I thought you were my neighbor.

253
00:19:04.458 --> 00:19:06.083
Oh. sorry.

254
00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.333
You were here before. right?

255
00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:09.708
-You were across the street?
-Yeah. Yeah. that was me.

256
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:11.708
I'm not some kind of
weird stalker or anything.

257
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:13.458
if that's what you're thinking.

258
00:19:13.541 --> 00:19:16.750
No. I didn't think you were.
Could you close the door behind you?

259
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:18.500
-Do you mind?
-Yeah. of course. Yeah. um…

260
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.375
What can I do for you?

261
00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:24.083
-[Ava whines]
-Hey. He's cute. Good boy.

262
00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:26.458
Girl. actually. That's Ava.

263
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.416
-Cool name. Hey. Ava.
-[whines]

264
00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:30.125
[laughs] Um…

265
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.958
This is the Turner residence. right?

266
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:36.291
[sighs] Sort of. Sort of.
Uh. I'm Jake Turner.

267
00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.500
Great. Nice to meet you. Mr. Turner.

268
00:19:38.583 --> 00:19:41.250
My name's Rachel Campbell.
And the reason I'm here…

269
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.833
Sorry. this is a little complicated.
but I'm trying to find my mother.

270
00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:51.708
And I think you might be able to help me.

271
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.416
She used to live here
a long time ago. I think. I hope.

272
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.291
Your mother lived here in this house?

273
00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:58.708
Yeah. um. when I was born…

274
00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:00.583
Rather. right before I was born.
she lived…

275
00:20:01.458 --> 00:20:04.458
This is Scott
and Lois Turner's house. right?

276
00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:08.541
Yeah. Uh. well. yeah. My parents.

277
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.875
Great. So. yeah. my birth mother.
she lived here and she worked for them.

278
00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.375
Your mother worked for my parents?

279
00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:16.666
From what I can tell.
she was actually their nanny.

280
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.458
-[fire crackling loudly]
-[Rachel] Um…

281
00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:24.250
Whoa! No! Oh. whoa. whoa! No. no. no!
Okay. hold on! Hold--

282
00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:25.416
Ow! That's hot.

283
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.333
You need a hand?

284
00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:28.666
[chuckling] No. no. it's…

285
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.375
-I got it under control.
-Okay.

286
00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.250
-[Jacob] Ah. forget it.
-Okay.

287
00:20:33.916 --> 00:20:36.625
So what brings Nancy Drew
to the Turner house. anyway?

288
00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:38.416
-If you don't mind me asking.
-[laughs]

289
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.916
It wasn't easy.
My adoption file was sealed.

290
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.625
But a friend of mine worked
for the Connecticut Records Department.

291
00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:45.333
By law. he couldn't tell me my mom's name.

292
00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:49.041
but he could tell me
her last known address which was here. so…

293
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.583
I understand. but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I…

294
00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:55.708
I was just about ready to head out.
I wish I could help you.

295
00:20:55.791 --> 00:20:58.291
-I don't think I can. though.
-No. I totally understand.

296
00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:01.333
I guess I just gotta
learn to leave the table.

297
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.166
Nina Simone.

298
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.708
That's right. Yeah. she's the best.

299
00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:10.208
-One of your favorites?
-She is.

300
00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:15.500
-You got any others?
-Uh. Peggy Lee. Ella. Lady Day.

301
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:17.791
-Aretha.
-Mmm. Oh. don't forget about Gladys.

302
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.750
[laughs] Oh. Gladys the Baddest. My dad…

303
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:24.416
He was my own personal musicologist.
taught me everybody.

304
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.166
Like Little Richard. Marvin Gaye.

305
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.875
-Marvin. We lost him when I was a kid.
-'84.

306
00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:32.625
-Yeah. Yep.
-You in music or something?

307
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.666
No. No. no. I'm a…

308
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.583
-I write a little bit.
-Really? Cool! Anything I know?

309
00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:40.666
Uh… You know. no. probably not.

310
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.208
-No? Anything I'd like?
-No. No. probably not. [laughs]

311
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.375
-Struggling artist? I get it.
-Ah…

312
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.583
Well. I guess we're all struggling
in one way or another. huh?

313
00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:52.125
Ain't that the truth.

314
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.291
Listen. I'm sorry
I couldn't help you with your mom.

315
00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:56.500
Yeah. Don't apologize.

316
00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.583
Honestly. just being in the house
where she once lived makes me feel…

317
00:22:03.166 --> 00:22:05.166
I don't know… [sighs]
…more connected to her somehow.

318
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

319
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:09.208
Anyway. thanks.

320
00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:14.208
-Um. thank you. Yeah.
-Oh.

321
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:16.125
Oops. [laughs] Merry Christmas.

322
00:22:16.208 --> 00:22:17.625
-Merry Christmas to you.
-Thank you.

323
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.416
-[Jacob] Wait. Ellie. Wait-- Rachel!
-[car driving off]

324
00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:27.000
Rachel. wait!

325
00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:28.541
[Ava barking]

326
00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:38.750
[Jacob pants]

327
00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:41.458
I have an idea.

328
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:49.375
Thing is. my neighbor's been living
here for years. and I was thinking she…

329
00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:52.000
[Ellie chuckling] I feel the same way.

330
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:53.916
[laughs]

331
00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:56.208
Well. that was quick.

332
00:22:58.541 --> 00:22:59.375
[Rachel] What?

333
00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:01.666
Uh. nothing. I'll explain later.

334
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.125
Listen. why don't I. um.
give you my phone number?

335
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.833
And then you can just text me tomorrow.

336
00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:08.583
-I'm sure I'll have spoken to her by then.
-Oh. that would be great.

337
00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:09.916
Actually. you know what? Um…

338
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.750
I think I might
just wait until she's back.

339
00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.416
-I'll wait in my car.
-You sure? She might be a while.

340
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.083
-I've come this far. so…
-Okay.

341
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:18.458
-Okay.
-Yup.

342
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:19.541
Thanks.

343
00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:40.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

344
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:42.625
What's up?

345
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:47.750
Are you hungry?
I was gonna grab a bite. if you're hungry.

346
00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:50.208
-[Rachel] Very cool.
-Mmm-hmm.

347
00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:52.333
-So is this an old haunt or…
-No.

348
00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:54.041
I haven't been here in years. actually.

349
00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:56.958
but my mom used to take me here a lot
when I was a kid.

350
00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:59.916
-She loved this place.
-I can see why. It's nice.

351
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.166
-Welcome to Trattoria Toscana.
-Thank you.

352
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.416
I am Vittorio.
May I share tonight's specials?

353
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.083
[in Italian] Sure. Thank you so much.

354
00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:08.208
-[Vittorio] Ah. do you speak Italian?
-Oh. yes.

355

-[Vittorio] Very good!
-[both laughing]

356
00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:12.375
For the first course.
I recommend the pumpkin tortelli.

357
00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:13.291
[Rachel] Mmm!

358
00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:15.666
Next. I would suggest
a nice baked sea bass.

359
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:21.125
We prepare it very lightly with a drizzle
of olive oil. lemon. and rosemary.

360
00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:24.625
Mmm! [speaking Italian]

361

365
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:37.208
No. no. it's… it's fine.
I'll just have whatever she's having.

366
00:24:37.291 --> 00:24:39.333
-Ah.
-Oh. and a glass of wine. please.

367
00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.875
-Do you want one?
-Uh. no. no.

368
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:41.916
You sure?

369
00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.333

of classic Chianti please.

370

-[Vittorio] Very good.
-Oh. uh. um… Separate checks?

371
00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:51.750
-Ah. but of course. Yes.
-Thank you.

372
00:24:51.833 --> 00:24:54.958
-[in English] What's that last thing?
-Oh. it's. um…

373
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:57.041
-Separate checks. Yeah.
-Separate checks?

374
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:59.500
You're a writer
and I just want to respect that.

375
00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:03.041
Both of my parents are artists.
They make and sell their own jewelry.

376
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.458
So as you can imagine. it's. uh…

377
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:08.125
there have been times
when the bills have been challenging.

378
00:25:08.208 --> 00:25:09.500
So I figure it's better to--

379
00:25:09.583 --> 00:25:13.083
I'm sure you can understand
and appreciate that sometimes it's--

380
00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:17.041
-Thank you. I appreciate it. Nice of you.
-Yeah. Yeah. of course.

381
00:25:17.625 --> 00:25:19.666
So you speak fluent Italian.
How'd that happen?

382
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.291
Well. actually.
I also speak French and German.

383
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:25.500
Little bit of Mandarin.

384
00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:27.000
-You speak a little Mandarin?
-A bit.

385
00:25:27.083 --> 00:25:28.250
[in Mandarin] I kid you not!

386
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.291
[in English] No. it's…
I'm a language major. so…

387
00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:32.708
-Got it. Cool. You don't hear that--
-Grazie.

388
00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:34.375
Thank you very much.

389
00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:37.333
Um. so how do you
while away the hours these days?

390
00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:41.083
Actually. I just applied for a job
as a translator at the UN.

391
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:43.208
-It's a long shot.
-Long shot? Why is it a long shot?

392
00:25:43.958 --> 00:25:45.291
Isn't everything?

393
00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:46.500
Mm.

395
00:25:47.916 --> 00:25:50.750
-Um. sorry. I should take this.
-Sure. No problem.

396
00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:52.166
-One second.
-Sure.

397
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:58.041
I'll see you at the table. all right?
Welcome home. stranger!

398
00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:00.625
Dion. hey! How are you?

399
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:03.333
-Man. how long has it been?
-It's been a while. 12th grade.

400
00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:06.333
Yeah. you disappeared.
Where did you go to college. anyway?

401
00:26:06.416 --> 00:26:09.708
You know. I didn't go. I ended up…
I went to Paris. School of life.

402

your new book into a movie?

I mean. this is what they say.

-Hometown hero.
-Thank you very much. You're very kind.

409
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:27.708
-It's great seeing you. man.
-Good to see you.

410
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.000
Sorry about that.

-Where were we?
-We were. um…

412
00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:38.333
Potential job. UN. Long shot.

413
00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:39.500
Yeah. it's…

414
00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:45.083
I don't know. with this new job.
it could be challenging. I don't know.

415
00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:47.833
-We may have to move and it's just…
-"We"?

416
00:26:48.791 --> 00:26:50.416
Yeah. Alan and me.

417
00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:54.000
-And Alan is?
-Oh. God. sorry. Alan's my fiancé.

418
00:26:54.083 --> 00:26:55.166
Oh. you're engaged?

419
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.833
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

420
00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:59.250
Hey. congratulations. I love love.

421
00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:01.916
-Great. Thank you.
-Cheers. This is wonderful.

422
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.375
Um. we haven't set a date yet.

423
00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:07.958
And Alan wants to.
but if I do get this job. then…

424
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.541
I don't-- We'll just
have to figure it out. I guess.

425
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:14.333
Haven't even looked
for engagement rings yet.

426
00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:17.833
Well. we went last week. and I don't know.
I couldn't pick anything.

427
00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:20.750
So I just… we just left and then…

428
00:27:20.833 --> 00:27:25.083
Actually. this was kind of cute.
On the walk home. he gave me this.

429

[chuckles]

430

-[Jacob] What's that?
-It's…

431
00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:32.208
Cigar ring.

432
00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.666
Believe it or not.
this silly ring came as kind of a relief.

433
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.958
-Yeah?
-I'm not into all that

434

kind of stuff.

435
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:44.083
The truth is I'm kind of ambivalent
about the concept of being engaged.

436
00:27:44.166 --> 00:27:46.208
-Mmm-hmm.
-One the one hand. I like the certainty.

437
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:49.208
but on the other. it makes you feel
kind of boxed in. you know?

438
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:52.958
Yeah. no. "boxed in" is something
I've managed to avoid my entire life.

439
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.166
[Rachel laughs]

440
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.125
In my case. it's tricky 'cause
Alan likes doing things by the book.

441
00:27:57.208 --> 00:28:00.416
And it's important to respect
what the other person wants. Right?

442
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.916
-Mmm-hmm.
-But he's a tax attorney!

443
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.833
He's very. very good at his job.
and he's super precise.

444
00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:07.333
Believe me. he'll be the one

It's gonna run like clockwork.

447
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:12.875
And the good thing is.
then I promise I'll shut up.

448
00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:15.791
but I think. I don't know.
Alan and I complement one another.

449
00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:18.958
And that's how it's…
It's supposed to be like that. right?

450
00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:22.250
I mean. I'm not an expert on the subject.
but. yeah. that sounds about right.

451
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.000
Well. for better or worse. I am.

452
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:26.958
I don't know.
I think being adopted. I'm just…

453
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.333
I'm always trying
to fill some kind of void.

454

I'm always looking
for security and reliability.

455
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:38.625
and that's why I think if I find my real--
my birth mom. it's…

456
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:44.250
I don't know. it'll resolve this
huge uncertainty in my life and then…

457
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.833
-I don't know.
-You'll be free.

-Yeah.
-Come on.

No. it was my pleasure.

do you think there's a…

there's a chance your parents
kept something of my mother's?

-At first. I pretty much hated it.
-And then?

Then it made her
really happy to hear me play. so…

482
00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:56.041
Will you play something for me?

483
00:29:58.083 --> 00:29:59.958
-Play something for you? Come on. No.
-Seriously.

[Rachel] Ah! Young love.

507
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.375
-[Ellie] Hi!
-So how was the date?

508
00:32:58.458 --> 00:32:59.958
It went well.

509
00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:01.333
Just well?

510
00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.125
It went very well.

511
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.833
Hmm!

512
00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:06.750
This is my friend. Rachel.

513
00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:08.250
-[Ellie] Hi!
-Hi. nice to meet you.

514
00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:11.041
Rachel's got a question
I think maybe only you can answer.

515
00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:13.958
[Ellie] Of course. I remember her.

516
00:33:14.041 --> 00:33:17.291
She was a babysitter.
a live-in babysitter.

517
00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:19.041
like. you know. like an au pair.

518
00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:20.541
[Rachel] Right. Right. sure.

519
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:25.833
She was very young.
Seventeen. maybe 18 at the most.

520
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:29.125
She must have moved
before the baby was born.

521
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:31.208
Do you remember her name or…

522
00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:32.958
Gosh. that's a good question.

523
00:33:33.041 --> 00:33:36.208
Seems like it had something
to do with Christmas.

524
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:39.166
like. um. Christina or Joy.

525
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.333
I'm drawing a blank.
but you know who would know?

526
00:33:42.416 --> 00:33:44.375
-Who's that?
-Your dad.

527
00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:49.083
Oh. Oh. no.

528
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:51.208
No. I don't. um… No.

529
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:53.666
Well. anyway. he lives in Vermont now.

530
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.000
It's way up in the mountains
in a little town called Cornwall Bridge.

532

How do you…
[sighs] How do you know all that?

533
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:04.041
When I saw him at the funeral.
we had a nice long chat.

534
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.958
You know. I really don't think
there would be any harm in talking--

535
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:08.791
"Harm in talking"? No. there will be harm.

536
00:34:08.875 --> 00:34:11.333
I haven't spoken to the guy in 35 years.
Ellie. come on.

537
00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.291
[hesitates] No. I'm aware. but--

538
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:16.916
No. no. no. I'm… Excuse me.

540

-[door closes]
-[Ellie] Oh. Jacob.

542
00:34:26.083 --> 00:34:28.083
Now you know why he stayed away so long.

543
00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:31.708
It would be good for him
if he could get over it.

544

545
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:44.625

-What?

546

-Listen.
-Yeah?

547
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:53.125
I know all that stuff in there
with my dad probably seemed irrational.

548
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.833
Oh. no. Jake. please.
You don't owe me any explanation. okay?

549
00:34:55.916 --> 00:34:57.958
I'm just some stranger
who showed up on your doorstep.

550
00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:59.333
You don't owe me anything.

551
00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:03.791
You've already helped me. like. a lot.
So thank you. And…

552
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:08.000
I really hope you have a lovely…
a lovely Christmas.

553
00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:09.708
You headed home?

554
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:12.250
Um…

555
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.166
No. I'm going to Cornwall Bridge.

556
00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:20.708
I need to know if I ever mattered to her.
Maybe you've wondered that about your dad?

557
00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:24.500
Truth is. if I ever saw him.
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

558
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.333
Well. maybe if you're up for a drive.

559
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:31.541
we could script a few lines.

561

562
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.000
Hop on up.

563
00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:50.250
You're leaving!
I guess it's. uh. time to head home?

564
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:53.583
Well. yes and no. actually.

565
00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:58.875
-How you doing? Jake Turner. Pleasure.
-Oh. Ian Page. Pleased to meet you.

566
00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:01.916
-I'm a big fan of your work. really.
-Oh. thank you.

567
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.083
I told Ian that you
basically wrote my profile.

568
00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:08.083
Ah. well. you know.
she made me take out all the racy stuff.

569
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.500
[laughs] Well. all's I can say
is meeting Eleanor

570
00:36:10.583 --> 00:36:12.750
is the greatest Christmas surprise
I could ask for.

571
00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:13.666
Aw.

572
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.083
Ian plays first violin
with the Hartford Symphony.

573
00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.791
Is that right? That's impressive.

574
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:20.041
-That's great.
-Thanks. mate.

575
00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:23.250
What did you mean when you
said you were leaving. "Yes and no"?

576
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.583
Yes. I'm leaving. No. I'm not going home.

577
00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:27.958
Uh. Rachel's supposed to be--

-Oh. there she is. Hey.
-Hey.

00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.083
I'm gonna go see my dad.

Waze would be easier?

Anyway.

the GPS leads them into mortal danger.

Um. actually. I. uh…

621
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.666
He doesn't…
I haven't told him about it yet.

622
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.458
What's he think
about this trip to Cornwall Bridge?

623
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:26.791
Uh. he's not thrilled. He's not thrilled.

624
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.708
And actually he was kind of… peeved.

625
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:33.791
Yeah. No. let me guess. it's. uh…

626

He's upset that you are taking
a road trip with this guy you just met?

No. actually. No. it was. um…

It was about the… the gas money.

No. it's just like

[Jacob] Okay.

631
00:38:49.375 --> 00:38:53.208
It's no big deal. and in the grand scheme
of things. it's meaningless. right?

632
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:56.750
I'm kind of insulted.
He's not concerned about me. right?

633
00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:59.333
-He's concerned about gas money.
-Well. he doesn't know about you.

[softly] Oh.

635
00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:06.416
[Rachel] As it turns out.
I didn't really know about you either.

636
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.166
-What are you talking about?
-I finally broke down and I Googled you.

637
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.125
-Oh. come on.
-And. honestly. I tried to put it off.

638
00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:14.083
Because I really don't like
looking people up.

639
00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:15.916

like an intrusion. somehow.

-But now… I'm really glad I did.

00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:31.000

It's in the backpack in the back there.

That was in a box

and I didn't look at it. What is it?

670
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:16.875
"They're ashamed of me."

671
00:41:16.958 --> 00:41:20.083
[Noel] And they're ashamed
of the child I'm bringing into this world.

672
00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.500
And so. I'm leaving.

673
00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:26.291
"They truly believe it's wrong for a woman
to have a child outside of marriage."

"'God disapproves.' they say."

forgive our mistakes?

Everyone I know and trust
has abandoned me.

hired me as their nanny."

Jake is four. and he's the quiet one.

Do you have any memory of that?
I know you were little. but…

684
00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:12.666
I really don't.

685
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.625
[Noel] He likes me to read
the Magic Tree House books to him.

686
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.291
So where's Ben now?

687
00:42:25.875 --> 00:42:28.166
Oh. there was this. um.

688
00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.625

We had…

00:42:33.458 --> 00:42:35.791
We had this giant elm tree
in our front yard.

691
00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:39.333
Benji loved to climb
and he was in that tree all the time.

692
00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:42.291
And that night.

693
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:45.916
Ben decided he was gonna climb
as high as he could in that tree.

694
00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.416
And hang his favorite ornament…

00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:57.541
[knocking]

838
00:50:58.291 --> 00:50:59.791
Everything okay in there?

839
00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.541
-Hi.
-Hi.

840
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:04.541
Yeah. I'm fine.

841
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:07.000
Great.

842
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.333
-I just-- I heard-- I thought I heard a--
-Oh. yeah. no.

843
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:15.250
[laughs] Thanks for checking. though.
Appreciate it.

844
00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:18.166
[nervously] Okay. Just. uh--
Well. just have a--

845
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:19.625
-[Rachel] Good night.
-Good night.

846
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:23.166
[soft expectant music playing]

847
00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:30.750
[Rachel faintly] No way!

848
00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:51.791
[Rachel faintly] Oh!

849
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.750
[exclaims]

850
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:14.208
[Jacob] How'd you sleep?

851
00:52:14.291 --> 00:52:15.416
[Rachel] Um…

852
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.750
[laughs] Actually.
I was up last night reading.

853
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.541
-Anything interesting?
-Uh. yeah. very.

854
00:52:22.458 --> 00:52:24.625
-Yeah?
-Green Eyes of Paris.

855
00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.375
-You know that one? [laughing]
-I've heard of it. You…

856
00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:29.791
[laughs] You bought my book
and you didn't tell me?

857
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:31.125
Yeah. well. I didn't…

858
00:52:31.208 --> 00:52:34.500
-I didn't wanna tell you just in case--
-Just in case what?

859
00:52:35.583 --> 00:52:37.125
In case I didn't like it.

860
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.750
-In case you didn't like it?
-Yeah.

861
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:41.250
And?

862
00:52:42.875 --> 00:52:43.875
Well…

863
00:52:44.708 --> 00:52:47.208
No. it's okay. You can tell me. It's fine.
My ego is. uh…

864
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:48.833
I think I can handle it.

865
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:51.583
-What's up? What did you think?
-Okay. well. um…

866
00:52:53.125 --> 00:52:55.708
-You know. I find it interesting…
-Yeah.

867
00:52:55.791 --> 00:53:01.916
…that you write these novels
filled with suspense. and drama. romance.

868
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.125
and yet your main character. Henri.

869
00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:06.583
he never lets anyone get close to him.

870
00:53:07.708 --> 00:53:09.833
It's kinda like what we were
talking about last night.

871
00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:14.666
Henri lives in occupied France. right?
He can't trust anybody.

872
00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:17.083
Well. yeah. but…

873
00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:24.208
This isn't occupied America.
So what's your excuse?

874
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.583
On the other hand…

875
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:31.291
um…

876
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.375
-I really loved the book.
-Yeah?

877
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.666
I loved it! It was just…

878
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:38.375
God. the ending?

879
00:53:39.125 --> 00:53:40.000
That was…

880
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.458
It kind of blew me away.

881
00:53:44.208 --> 00:53:46.125
Good. Good. good. good.

882
00:53:46.208 --> 00:53:48.791
The endings are. uh… ending. it's…

883
00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:51.458
They're always hard to get right.
you know. Yeah.

884
00:53:52.166 --> 00:53:56.083
Any thoughts on the current story?
You gonna get that ending right?

885
00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.208
[chuckling]

886
00:53:57.291 --> 00:53:59.166

-[Rachel laughs]
-[car engine starting]

888
00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:11.166
[Noel] I found out today
I'm having a girl.

889
00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:14.041
a sweet. little baby girl.

890
00:54:14.916 --> 00:54:18.583
Before I left home. my parents
told me not to name my baby.

891
00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:22.666
"Because it would
only make it harder to say goodbye."

892
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:25.375
"But I've already… given her a name."

893
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.625
[Noel] My angel.

894
00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:37.500
[wistful music playing]

895
00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:41.291
Um. can you pull over? I… I need…
I need some air.

896
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:43.333
-You sure? It's freezing outside.
-Yeah. please.

897
00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:44.583
[Jacob] Okay. Sure.

898
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:59.458
Hey. Come on.

899
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:03.125
Ah! It's freezing out here. Here you go.

900
00:55:03.791 --> 00:55:04.791
You all right?

901
00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:08.875
[gentle music playing]

902
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.750
[voice breaking]
Why would she leave it behind?

903
00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:16.125
Why go through the trouble
of writing everything down

904
00:55:16.208 --> 00:55:18.375
and documenting all these details
if she wasn't…

905
00:55:18.875 --> 00:55:20.583
if she was just gonna abandon it?

906
00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:22.958
I don't know.

907
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:26.083
You know. maybe she thought it would
find its way back to you. eventually?

908
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:29.125
Or maybe she just
wanted to forget everything.

909
00:55:30.125 --> 00:55:31.583
Like it never existed.

910
00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:35.208
-Like I never existed.
-[quietly] No.

911
00:55:44.458 --> 00:55:48.125
I'm supposed to be engaged.
I'm supposed to be getting married.

912
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:51.083

915
00:55:57.291 --> 00:56:00.166
-[Jacob] Oh. no! What are you-- No. wait!
-[barking continues]

916
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:01.875

[barks]

922
00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:20.958
-What were you gonna do if you caught it?
-Yeah.

923
00:56:22.375 --> 00:56:24.208
[laughs] That was incredible.

924
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:29.166
[sighs]

925
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.666
Guess life's all about the chase.
huh. Turner?

[upbeat music playing]

927

[upbeat music continues]

928
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.208
-[Jacob] I think we took a wrong turn.
-[Rachel laughs]

929
00:57:03.291 --> 00:57:06.291
-You mean you hope we took a wrong turn?
-Exactly.

930
00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:07.250
[Rachel chuckles]

931
00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:27.291
Please tell me
the universe really does reward the brave.

932
00:57:27.916 --> 00:57:28.916
You got this.

933
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:33.791
[sighs] Here we go.

934
00:58:02.791 --> 00:58:04.541
[gentle music playing]

935
00:58:11.166 --> 00:58:13.833
[Jacob] It was a day
he had both been anticipating…

936
00:58:16.333 --> 00:58:17.541
and dreading.

937
00:58:26.916 --> 00:58:28.500
[gentle music continues]

938
00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:29.916

943

Jacob.

944
00:59:35.083 --> 00:59:37.708
You know. Eleanor called
to say you might be coming.

945
00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:40.333
I told her I didn't believe it.

946
00:59:40.416 --> 00:59:43.708
but she said over and over again.
"Just be prepared."

947
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.041
Are you?

948
00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:49.458
Yeah! I…

949
00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:52.666
I'm cutting down
this Christmas tree for you.

950
00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:57.291
I've only been waiting for this moment
for 30-odd years. and now that it's here…

951
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.875
Yeah.

952
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.666
Same.

953
01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:11.291
[grunts]

954
01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:16.791
Mind giving me a hand?

955
01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:24.291
Plus. if it's just you.
what's the point. right?

956
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:28.041
[Jacob] Yeah. well. if it's any
consolation. I've never had a tree.

957
01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.500
so you're ahead of me.

958
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:34.458
[Scott] All right.
Welcome to my humble abode.

959
01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:36.750
Here we go.

960
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.958
-Now just set this end down here.
-Yeah.

961
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:42.458
[Scott] Can you tip it up?

962
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.208
-Gotta get the stand.
-[Jacob] All right.

963
01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.833
-You live out here all alone?
-I do!

964
01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.416
-All right.
-[Jacob] Ellie painted that. right?

965
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500
Good eye. Yeah. that's hers.

966
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.125
All right.

967
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.750
-I think that should do it.
-[Jacob] Yeah?

968
01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:08.541
-Look at that.
-[Scott] Good job.

969
01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:11.166
-[phone ringing]
-[Scott] Oh. Excuse me.

970
01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.291

971
01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:15.958
[in background] Scott Turner. Hello?

972
01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.125
Yes.

973
01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:22.250
[wistful music playing]

974
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.208
[Scott] See you then.

975
01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:42.041
[grunts] Sorry about that.

976
01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:45.333
That was. uh. one of my clients.

977
01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:50.208
-Your clients? What do you do?
-I'm a social worker at the VA.

978
01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:52.541
Social. you're trying
to do some good in the world?

979
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.625
[chuckles]

980
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:55.416
Underline "trying."

981
01:01:57.458 --> 01:02:01.416
You know. I bought these
forever ago when I first moved in.

982
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.083
and I never even took them out of the box.

983
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.291
Think they still work?

984
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.083
I don't know.

985
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:13.333
Jake…

986
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.541
I know an apology doesn't mean
a whole lot after all these years…

987
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:19.750
You know what? It's…

988
01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:21.875
You can save it.

989
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:25.500
I didn't come out here for a. uh.
you know. reconciliation.

990
01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:28.333
I'm only here to help a friend. honestly.

991
01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:32.666
-A friend?
-Yeah. a friend. It's a long story.

992
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:38.458
Well. since you're here. can I at least
say what I've been waiting--

993
01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:41.291
I'd. I'd… I'd really rather you didn't.

994
01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:42.875
I am sorry.

995
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.625
[mutters] You're sorry.

996
01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:53.791
I am deeply. deeply sorry.

997
01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:57.083
[chuckles]

998
01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:58.333
[grunts]

999
01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:01.208
Yeah. Good.

1000
01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:03.375
Good. So we're all set then.

1001
01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:04.833
You know. um.

1002
01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:07.083
you left me alone with Mom.

1003
01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:10.833
and then you run up here.
and you just disappear altogether…

1004
01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.500
[shouts] And you're sorry?

1005
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.166
God! I said I wasn't gonna do this.

1006
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.000
Uh. you know what?
This was a mistake. I can't do this.

1007
01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.958
-Jake!
-Enjoy your tree.

1008
01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:30.541
-Hey!
-No. I can't handle this.
