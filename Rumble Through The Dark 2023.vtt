00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.100
<i>I wish I knew

Well. there he is.

12
00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:27.381
- Welcome back. Jack.

13
00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:40.002
Looks like
your little naps
are getting longer.

14
00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:46.313
How about a smoke?

15
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:02.329
Could've had twice this
if you hadn't cracked
my boy's collarbone.

16
00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.375
I went down like you said.

17
00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:08.248
Yes. you did.

00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:12.426
You earned it.
Come on.

He's a good kid.

24
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:32.462
I just don't really know
what you can expect.

25
00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:47.755
One time. Jack.

26
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.281
One time. asshole.

00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:29.318
Sixty-four hundred.

00:07:31.494 --> 00:07:32.756
Slide it out there.

40
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.631

We won.

43
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.525

46
00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:43.479
Hey.

47
00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:47.048
You got a light?

48
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.065
<i>She just won't stop.</i>

49
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.989
Oh. my God!

50
00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:48.718

00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:50.024
I got her damn money.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.728
Uh. congratulations. sir.

53
00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:43.077
Count the chips.

54
00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:45.688
Uh. could I. um...
Could I interest you

55
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:49.431

- Just count the damn chips.

56
00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:12.019
Second. Reverse.

57
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.629
Wait. Hold on.

58
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:16.414
Oh. you missed the turn...

59
00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:27.034
You going by Luling's?

60
00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:29.340
No. man. Her kids
back from school.

61
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.559
so that ain't gonna happen.

62
00:11:31.342 --> 00:11:34.389
- I hear you.
- What you mean "her kids"?

63
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:36.391
-  Don't you
mean your kids?

64
00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:01.155
-  Yeah. hopefully.

65
00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:25.179
That pump out there still work?

66
00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:28.617
Damn. boy. You ask me
that every time.

67
00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:31.707
- How much you want?
- Uh...

68
00:12:31.707 --> 00:12:34.275
- About this much.

69
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.540
Good. 'cause I ain't
got no change.

70
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.935
Long as he's been
coming here. you never have.

71
00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:43.719
- He don't remember that.

72
00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:45.068
Charge him double.

73
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.244
What for?

74
00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:49.464
I lost all that money on him
down there in Itta Bena

75
00:12:49.464 --> 00:12:51.031
- that one night.
-  Oh. here we go.

76
00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:53.120
You gonna tell that damn
Itta Bena story again?

77
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.122
-  I know. right?
- I deserve to tell my story

78
00:12:55.122 --> 00:12:57.428
the way I lost my damn
money on Boucher.

79
00:12:57.428 --> 00:13:00.780
Way down in the damn sticks
where shouldn't no damn body be.

80
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.652
I like the guy carried off
by the mosquitos.

81
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:05.872
You lost because I won
or because I lost?

82
00:13:11.703 --> 00:13:14.097
Hell. I don't know.
Shouldn't be betting anyhow.

83
00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:15.403
You hear that?

84
00:13:15.403 --> 00:13:17.797
You shouldn't be betting
anyhow.

85
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.669
Heh. this old boy here

00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:22.584

No. You the fool...

88
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.677
Come on. Pick up.

89
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:40.689
- Hmm?
-  <i>Hey. This Ern?</i>

90
00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:43.953
- Tch. Who's this?
- <i>She up?</i>

91
00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:45.912
- Depends.

92
00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:49.393
-  Who this is?
- <i>It's Skelly.</i>

93
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.136
- She ain't up.

94
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:58.446
She might be up
when she find out
what I'm looking at. Hmm.

95
00:13:58.446 --> 00:13:59.839
<i>Jack Boucher.</i>

96
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.886
Really? Jack Boucher?

97
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:06.236
Hey. I ain't got time for this.
You want him or not?

98
00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.717
<i>You sure it's him?</i>

99
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.198
How many times
Big Momma make me fight

100
00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:13.635
on the same card
as the Butcher. huh?

101
00:14:15.332 --> 00:14:16.551
'Course. it's him.

102
00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:21.861
- <i>Bring Jack here.</i>

103
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.601
<i>Not without a damn promise.</i>

104
00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:26.691
- What promise?
- <i>That I don't owe shit.</i>

105
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.173
<i>Ern. you listening?</i>

106
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.961
- <i>She says no.</i>
- You didn't ask her.

107
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:36.223
<i>I ain't got to. Skelly.</i>

108
00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.268
You better think
good and hard again

109
00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:40.401
'cause he gonna leave
any minute now.

110
00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:43.404
I'll get him there.
I don't owe nothing to nobody.

111
00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:48.409
You get him here
and you don't owe
nothing to nobody.

112
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:11.998
Hey.

113
00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:19.440
What?

114
00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:22.530
Hey. man. do you-- do you mind
hauling me up the road?

115
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.620
I just need a ride
to Clarksdale.

116
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.882
if you're going that way.

117
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:30.930
My old lady stays
at this trailer park
just right before town.

118
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:35.978
Nah.

119
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:41.114
Come on. man. I'm in deep shit.
I... I gotta get home.

120
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:43.203
That's your problem.

121
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:46.684
I got some money.

122
00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:54.301

123
00:15:55.432 --> 00:15:57.826

With a K.

127
00:16:08.097 --> 00:16:09.707
Like the damn cigarettes?

128
00:16:09.707 --> 00:16:12.101
My momma loved them.
so...

129
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:18.847
How much money you got?

130
00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:23.460
Maybe 15.

131
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:28.770
All right. Give it
to me and get in.

132
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:03.152
It'd be fine with me
if we just kept on riding.

133
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.330
My old lady don't wanna
see me no way.

134
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.029
You know how they are.

135
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.161
Not really.

136
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:30.136
If you wanna start walking
across this black night

137
00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:31.920
- with a broke nose...

138
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.009
...then you do that shit again.

139
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.536
Damn. man.

140
00:17:40.363 --> 00:17:41.712
Don't gotta do all that.

141
00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:44.063
You sit still
and fucking ride.

142
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.152

Ain't so tough with your nuts

This is mine now. Goddammit.

156
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.160
Old ass Jack Boucher.

Hey. lesbian boy.

<i>Quit calling me that.</i>

<i>That's what your new momma is.</i>

166
00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:44.008
Leave me alone.

167
00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:45.749
You better put your hands
in your pockets.

168
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.100
You shove your hands
in your pockets right now

169
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.190

than you think.

170
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:55.819
Wait.

Everybody slow up.

Okay. We're gonna

180
00:22:23.211 --> 00:22:24.517
Hey. what's the holdup?

181
00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:37.443
Anybody? Hey.

182
00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:55.635
Anybody here?

183
00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:00.074
If you're hurt. call out.

184
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:05.384
Baron. what is it?

185
00:23:06.863 --> 00:23:08.735
Don't know yet.

186
00:23:21.878 --> 00:23:22.966
Anything?

187
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:26.535
Ain't nothing.

188
00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:32.889
- Hello?

189
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.110
-  Anybody out there?

190
00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:08.490
Hey. brother.

191
00:24:16.063 --> 00:24:17.368
Oh. my God.

192
00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.513
-  Ugh.
-  Brother.

193
00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:38.607
He must've crawled
out of the truck.

194
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:44.091
-  He ain't
gonna make it.

195
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:54.580
Is this what you want?

196
00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:04.111
It'll be quick.

197
00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:06.679
Just look at me brother.

198
00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:40.234
We better call somebody.

199
00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.542
You know I can't do that.

200
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:51.158
Well. we-we could just
go down the road

201
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:53.116
- and-and call it in.
- You know what. Annette?

202
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.292
Let's just go.

203
00:26:01.298 --> 00:26:03.213
Somebody will be along
soon enough. Come on.

204
00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:27.890
It's heavy.

205
00:26:37.465 --> 00:26:38.988
Hey. baby girl.

206
00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:41.469
What you got there. honey?

207
00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:54.787
Just take it.

208
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.840
About time
you wake your ass up.

209
00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:52.192
Huh? What the hell happened?

210
00:27:52.975 --> 00:27:55.021
You stumbled in here
lookin' crazy as a motherfucker

211
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:57.937
came by them cornfield.
crawled and rolled all cut up.

212
00:27:57.937 --> 00:27:59.852
moaning about your mama
or some shit.

213
00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:02.376
Set up here at the bar.
took some shots.
and passed the fuck out.

214
00:28:05.292 --> 00:28:07.120
- Was somebody with me?

215
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.643
- I ain't seen nobody.

216
00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:11.690
Did I say where my truck was?

217
00:28:12.647 --> 00:28:14.083
Back down the road somewhere.

218
00:28:16.346 --> 00:28:18.087
Why didn't you call somebody?

219
00:28:19.306 --> 00:28:20.611
We ain't got no phone.

220
00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:23.310
Ain't got no phone?

221
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.920
Ain't never had a need for one.

222
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.792
We don't get many drunk.
beat-up White boys

223
00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:29.098
- looking to make
late-night phone calls.

224
00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:31.492
Closing time. man.
I'mma need that 20 dollars
for them shots.

225
00:28:31.492 --> 00:28:32.493
Yeah.

226
00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:40.936
Here's the 20 I owe you.

227
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.809
Can you take me to my truck?

228
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.725
I got you.

229
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:04.133
Man. you are fucked up.
You ain't got no business
with no keys in your pocket.

230
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:31.639
Fuck.

231
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.904
Fuck.

232
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:37.732
No.

233
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.961
Damn it!

234
00:30:18.077 --> 00:30:19.078
Big Momma.

235
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.316
So what
should we do with it?

236
00:32:08.143 --> 00:32:09.928
- Divide it up?

237
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:13.496
Ain't no such thing
as a democracy
when it comes to money.

238
00:32:13.496 --> 00:32:17.109
Half this crew are ex-cons.
the other half. cons-in-waiting.

239
00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:19.720
They get one little sniff
of a handout.

240
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.069
they'll think there's more.

241
00:32:21.983 --> 00:32:23.985
And I'll wake up
with my throat cut.

242
00:32:25.856 --> 00:32:27.946
- Burn it then.
- What?

243
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:30.600
I mean. we got to do
something with it.

244
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.213
We could give it to somebody.

245
00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:36.911
You know. it's not
jackpot lottery money

246
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:39.740
but it's the type of money that
could change somebody's life.

247
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.828
You can have it.

248
00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:46.921
No. No. I...

249
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:51.970
- I don't want it.
- How come?

250
00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:54.798
I just...

251
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:58.498
feel all uneasy about it.

252
00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:03.068
- Just feels like a bad sign.

253
00:33:04.243 --> 00:33:06.332
You and your damn signs.

254
00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:10.466
It brought me
to this rattling heap
you call a carnival.

255
00:33:11.293 --> 00:33:13.556
And now something
brought this money to us.

256
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.168
That how it work?

257
00:33:16.168 --> 00:33:17.952
Only took you a year.

258
00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:19.823
Oh. you've been here
longer than that.

259
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:27.135
Ha... has it been that long?

260
00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:35.230
And you still think
you'll find your father?

261
00:33:36.623 --> 00:33:39.234
And is he what you hope's
at the end of all this.

262
00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:45.893
Shit.

263
00:33:50.115 --> 00:33:51.551
I shouldn't have said nothin'.

264
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:22.364
<i>Step right up
to the Princess of Love.</i>

265
00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:24.714
<i>Annette. The Painted Lady.</i>

266
00:34:26.325 --> 00:34:29.328
<i>Pick a symbol
from her colorful sign.</i>

267
00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:31.504
<i>20 bucks buys you a symbol.</i>

268
00:34:31.504 --> 00:34:36.248
<i>find it on her dancing body
and you win 100 dollars.</i>

269
00:34:36.248 --> 00:34:38.032
<i>Now who's feeling lucky?</i>

270
00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:36.194
You wanna try?

271
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:40.589
All right.
Put your hands like this.

272
00:36:42.025 --> 00:36:45.420
Like that.
There... Like that.

273
00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:51.731
This way. Like that. Okay.

274
00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:52.819
Okay.

275
00:36:55.474 --> 00:36:57.389
You like it?

276
00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:34.355
Mary.

277
00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:44.191
Who are you?

278
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.939
My name is Jack.

279
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:18.878
Mama. I'm sorry.

280
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:49.517
What's the matter.
Ricky Joe?

281
00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:53.478
- Tilt-a-Whirl acting up
on you again?

282
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.351
No.

283
00:39:58.613 --> 00:40:00.920
No. I ain't here about
no damn Tilt-a-Whirl.

284
00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:10.756
I think y'all picked up
something at that wreck. Mm?

285
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.063
I seen her with it last night.

286
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:17.371
I was peeking.

287
00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:19.591
I like to peek...

288
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.115
especially on her.

289
00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:27.512
Ricky Joe.

290
00:40:29.209 --> 00:40:30.950
it's too bad you ain't smarter.

291
00:40:32.212 --> 00:40:33.431
Well. I'm getting there.

292
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.478
You know. I often wonder
how many walls

293
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:39.306
your mugshot is pinned on.

294
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.744
How many folders
it's tucked into?

295
00:40:42.744 --> 00:40:46.139
Yeah. I wonder how many graves
are full of old men

296
00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:47.401
who didn't know no better.

297
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:53.755
-  Hm?

298
00:40:54.756 --> 00:40:56.454
All right. Okay.

299
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.326
You got me. You wanna see
what we found?

300
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:01.328
Mm-hmm.

301
00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:02.938
- I'm gonna show you.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:06.202
You ain't gonna like it.
just don't get upset.

303
00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:07.943
Oh. look I got a fucking gun.

304
00:41:11.033 --> 00:41:13.296
What is the old saying
about bringing a wrench

305
00:41:13.296 --> 00:41:14.428
to a gun fight?

306
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:18.954
That's what we call
a social faux pas. Ricky Joe.

307
00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:23.219
Go on. Ricky Joe.
get out of my fucking office.

308
00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:24.830
-  Right. I hear you.
-  That's it.

309
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.484
- Walk out. Walk out.
- A-all right.

310
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:29.312
All red-faced and sweaty.

311
00:41:29.312 --> 00:41:30.662
All right. Baron.

312
00:41:32.664 --> 00:41:35.580
You ain't the worst
I've seen. Ricky Joe.

313
00:41:39.758 --> 00:41:41.499
You don't know shit.

314
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:20.554
Need something. Big Momma?

315
00:43:23.209 --> 00:43:24.166
No.

316
00:43:25.298 --> 00:43:27.126
It doesn't look like
it's gonna stop raining.

317
00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:30.303
It ain't. I can tell it
in my knee bone.

318
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:33.045
I wish I had a dollar
for everything

319
00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:34.916
your knee bone claimed to know.

320
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:39.312
What you think happened
to Skelly?

321
00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:41.140
Ain't no telling.

322
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.402
You think he lying?

323
00:43:42.402 --> 00:43:43.882
I think Skelly would tell you

324
00:43:43.882 --> 00:43:45.710
he was having dinner
with Jesus Christ

325
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.190
if he thought he could
buy himself a little more time.

326
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.584
Me and you both know
Skelly can't handle Jack.

327
00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:52.630
He's the one we got
to look out for.

328
00:43:53.587 --> 00:43:56.372
- Word's out.
- Word been out.

329
00:43:56.372 --> 00:43:58.940
Apparently he ain't
so easy to hold onto.

330
00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:02.901
You know. your knee bone says
it's gonna keep on raining.

331
00:44:03.728 --> 00:44:04.903
that ain't stopping nothing.

332
00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.079
Shacks look full up.

333
00:44:08.515 --> 00:44:10.996
God has yet to create
any kind of weather

334
00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:13.476
that would detour
his flock from sin.

335
00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:16.218
Hallelujah. Big Momma.

336
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.394
Hallelujah.

337
00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:25.358
Here comes one more.

338
00:44:34.497 --> 00:44:37.022
- Holy shit. Big Momma.
- What's that?

339
00:44:38.893 --> 00:44:41.330
Who was it that Jesus
raised up from the grave?

340
00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:43.942
Lazarus?

341
00:44:45.117 --> 00:44:47.859
Yeah. Lazarus.

342
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.063
Here's your boyfriend.

343
00:45:18.063 --> 00:45:20.326
That don't look like my money.

344
00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:22.197
I don't have
your damn money no more.

345
00:45:23.198 --> 00:45:24.243
I had it

346
00:45:24.983 --> 00:45:26.941
before this piece of shit
got in the way.

347
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.207
Look at that. Huh?

348
00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:36.385
- I know who he came from.
-  Hey. motherfucker.

349
00:45:37.647 --> 00:45:38.866
Remember where you are.

350
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:40.172
Turn him loose.

351
00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:43.741
- Jack never had
no manners anyway.

352
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.395
Y'all both back off.
Right now.

353
00:45:51.009 --> 00:45:53.663
What you figure
this little show does for you?

354
00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:57.667
I'm showing you because
you ain't doing that shit to me.

355
00:45:58.886 --> 00:46:02.542
I can't figure whether
you're getting braver or dumber.

356
00:46:03.543 --> 00:46:06.851
I had your money.
Big Momma. Every nickel.

357
00:46:08.243 --> 00:46:09.418
So. where is it?

358
00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:11.464
I lost it

359
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:13.945
because of this
little shit-eater.

360
00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:17.775
Look at my damn eyes.
You know I'm telling the truth.

361
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:20.212
You look like a pile
of shit bricks.

362
00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:22.214
And you don't look
capable no more.

363
00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:24.956
- Capable of what?
- Not a single damn thing.

364
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.923
Most I ever let anyone
get into me

365
00:46:35.923 --> 00:46:38.056
when I knew they didn't have
a pot to piss in

366
00:46:38.056 --> 00:46:39.709
was about ten grand.

367
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.755
- Know where he at?

368
00:46:41.755 --> 00:46:43.148
I could probably figure it out.

369
00:46:43.148 --> 00:46:45.280
The only reason
I let you get in so deep

370
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.065
was because you made me
some money

371
00:46:47.065 --> 00:46:49.110
back when you was worth a shit.

372
00:46:49.676 --> 00:46:53.332
I ain't never seen nobody
fix a fight as good as you.

373
00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:55.813
Even when everybody know
it was a setup.

374
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:58.554
it always come off different
from what they was expecting.

375
00:46:58.554 --> 00:46:59.817
Yeah.

376
00:47:00.687 --> 00:47:02.297
That was a good trick.

377
00:47:03.298 --> 00:47:06.214
But I don't figure
you got any more tricks left.

378
00:47:06.214 --> 00:47:07.781
else you wouldn't
have let that worm

379
00:47:07.781 --> 00:47:09.000
on my floor get to you.

380
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.002
I made you money
before I started fixing.

381
00:47:11.002 --> 00:47:12.220
I remember that.

382
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.919
Yeah. I remember them days too.

383
00:47:14.919 --> 00:47:17.225
You used to be hell.

384
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:18.400
Ain't no doubt.

385
00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:21.882
But hell has caught up.

386
00:47:25.625 --> 00:47:29.498
See. Jack. I even know
why you tryin' to score big.

387
00:47:30.499 --> 00:47:32.066
I know about that woman

388
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:34.547
you letting die
in that place over there.

389
00:47:34.547 --> 00:47:36.679
I know you pissed away
her land...

390
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:38.333
- Her house.

391
00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:42.555
Mr. Bank Man comes out here
now and again to get rubbed on.

392
00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:44.426
He told me all about it.

393
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:48.517
Says he warned her not to sign
nothing over to you.

394
00:47:48.517 --> 00:47:51.259
- Mm-hmm.
- Says he saw it all coming.

395
00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:54.480
Says she told him
to mind his own business
or some shit.

396
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.179
- Good for him.
- Yeah. Good for him.

397
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.313
Make him feel smart. I reckon.

398
00:48:01.922 --> 00:48:04.185
But you in a big hole.

399
00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:05.795
A big hole that got bigger

400
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:08.494
when you started dancing
around Big Momma Sweet.

401
00:48:12.454 --> 00:48:14.065
What kind of price
you got on me?

402
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.026
The kind that'll
get you chased down
no matter where you go.

403
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:26.425
Oh.

404
00:48:27.643 --> 00:48:29.297
- Mm. mm. mm.

405
00:48:36.348 --> 00:48:37.479
What you doing. boy?

406
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.831
- Come on. Open up. Open up.

407
00:48:53.191 --> 00:48:55.889
I keep waitin' for something
different from you...

408
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.413
...but you more fucked up

409
00:48:58.413 --> 00:49:00.024
every time I see you.

410
00:49:01.503 --> 00:49:03.941
And you ain't got
no damn money...

411
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.246
- ...'cause if you did.

412
00:49:05.246 --> 00:49:07.205
you'd be giving it to me.

413
00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:10.382
- I believe you maybe had it.

414
00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:13.298
I heard you was running hot
down in Natchez.

415
00:49:13.298 --> 00:49:17.563
But had ain't
the same thing as have.

416
00:49:20.653 --> 00:49:22.829
- Don't really need no fire...

417
00:49:23.786 --> 00:49:25.440
...long since figured that out.

418
00:49:31.098 --> 00:49:32.752
I can get you paid. Big Momma.

419
00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:34.797
- Untrue.
- I can.

420
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:36.930
I got some more stuff
I can sell.

421
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.410
Valuable stuff.

422
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.673
- Listen to you.
- I swear to God.

423
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:42.762
God ain't cooperating
with you no more.

424
00:49:42.762 --> 00:49:45.634
Just give me a day or two.
I won't run off.

425
00:49:45.634 --> 00:49:47.506
No. you won't.

426
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:50.378
- But you can't get me my money.

427
00:49:51.162 --> 00:49:52.250
Me and you both know

428
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.252
the only way for you
to get me paid

429
00:49:54.252 --> 00:49:56.210
is the old-fashioned way.

430
00:49:57.646 --> 00:49:59.822
- I can't do that.
- How come?

431
00:49:59.822 --> 00:50:03.348
Hell. you seen me.
My damn head will explode.

432
00:50:03.348 --> 00:50:05.654
You've been fighting. I heard.

433
00:50:05.654 --> 00:50:07.961
Those weren't real fights
and you know it.

434
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:09.397
Not like you want.

435
00:50:09.397 --> 00:50:10.964
And I was full of dope.

436
00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:12.879
You can get
full of dope again.

437
00:50:12.879 --> 00:50:15.142
- I think you know

438
00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:17.101
this is the right choice.

439
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.276
but you decide.

440
00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:21.496
Fight or don't fight.

441
00:50:21.496 --> 00:50:23.890
You might get hurt if you do.

442
00:50:24.499 --> 00:50:27.589
You will get hurt
if you don't.

443
00:50:36.468 --> 00:50:37.556
I ain't fighting.

444
00:50:42.822 --> 00:50:46.086
Big Momma. Big Momma.
you know me.

445
00:50:46.086 --> 00:50:47.261
Hold it right there.

446
00:50:57.141 --> 00:51:00.318
-  Hold his head.

447
00:51:01.275 --> 00:51:03.060
Stop. Will you?

448
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:07.760
I'll do it. Big Momma.
Whatever you want.

449
00:51:13.635 --> 00:51:16.986
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

450
00:51:16.986 --> 00:51:22.209
I wish you knew how bad
I wanna put you out your misery.

451
00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:26.996
I wish you were the Jack
I used to know.

452
00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:29.347
- But for one night.

453
00:51:29.347 --> 00:51:30.609
- you will be.

454
00:51:33.002 --> 00:51:35.918
I don't give a shit
if your head explode

455
00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:38.138
or if you catch fire.

456
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:40.836
You ain't no good to me dead.

457
00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:42.708
You ain't much good alive.

458
00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:45.232
But you're gonna
give me a fight.

459
00:51:46.886 --> 00:51:48.975
This little burn ain't nothing.

460
00:51:48.975 --> 00:51:52.196
That little headache you got.
ain't nothing.

461
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.981
Screw me again

462
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:57.418
and you will know what hurt is.

463
00:51:57.418 --> 00:52:00.291
And I will feed
this sweet land of ours

464
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:02.815
with your sorry skin and bones.

465
00:52:04.338 --> 00:52:08.168
Now take this with you
so you won't forget.

466
00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:17.569
<i>Jack.</i>

467
00:52:36.022 --> 00:52:37.241
It's okay. Jack.

468
00:52:38.242 --> 00:52:39.591
You can open up now.

469
00:52:48.121 --> 00:52:49.209
Listen to me.

470
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.127
Tomorrow. Jack.
whatever you have to do

471
00:52:54.127 --> 00:52:56.260
to get him to leave you
alone. you do it.

472
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.350
I can't.

473
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:00.655
You're gonna have to

474
00:53:02.222 --> 00:53:04.572
because that little jackass
isn't going away.

475
00:53:05.747 --> 00:53:08.054
And he's gonna be
wherever you go

476
00:53:08.054 --> 00:53:11.492
because the world never runs out
of assholes like him.

477
00:53:13.494 --> 00:53:15.453
People who know
they have the odds.

478
00:53:18.499 --> 00:53:21.110
It doesn't matter
what he says about me.

479
00:53:22.068 --> 00:53:25.376
It doesn't matter
what he uses to pick a fight.

480
00:53:25.376 --> 00:53:27.682
Nobody has the right
to call you names

481
00:53:27.682 --> 00:53:29.206
or to hurt you.

482
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:30.250
Nobody.

483
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.124
What is it?

484
00:53:38.127 --> 00:53:39.694
I'm afraid if I do
anything bad...

485
00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:43.437
...they're gonna take me
away from you.

486
00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:47.180
Or you'll tell them

487
00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.703
you can't do it no more.

488
00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:51.532
That's what they always say.

489
00:53:52.403 --> 00:53:54.231
And I don't want it
to happen this time.

490
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:57.451
I don't wanna leave you

491
00:53:58.931 --> 00:54:01.716
so I can't do nothing bad
or they'll take me away.

492
00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:02.717
Oh.

493
00:54:04.806 --> 00:54:05.764
Oh.

494
00:54:06.591 --> 00:54:08.593
I swear no such thing
will happen.

495
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:10.508
I swear it.

496
00:54:12.684 --> 00:54:15.034
I will always be
on your side.

497
00:54:24.304 --> 00:54:25.479
What's today. Ern?

498
00:54:28.221 --> 00:54:30.136
-  Thursday. Big Momma.
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.399
Sounds to me like Friday night

500
00:54:32.399 --> 00:54:34.662
would be a good night
for Jack's big comeback.

501
00:54:35.663 --> 00:54:38.187
We got shacks
full of fools tonight.

502
00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:39.711
we gonna spread the word.

503
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:42.279
I figure this is
the kind of news

504
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:43.932
that'll burn in quick.

505
00:54:43.932 --> 00:54:46.021
- What you think. Jack?

506
00:54:58.251 --> 00:54:59.383
Get up. Jack.

507
00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:02.734
Come on.

508
00:55:03.822 --> 00:55:05.737
Get that trash
that you brought in here

509
00:55:05.737 --> 00:55:06.912
out of my house.

510
00:55:08.217 --> 00:55:09.915
Go put it out there
in the dirt somewhere.

511
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.060
Deep. Jack. Bury it deep.

512
00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:28.542
Where them damn dogs
can't dig it up.

513
00:57:12.254 --> 00:57:14.692
Get it off me.
Take this shit off me.

514
00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:16.563
Get it off me.

515
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:20.567
Get it off me. get it off.
get it off me.

516
00:57:32.144 --> 00:57:35.103
Come on. you motherfucker.
Come on.

517
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:39.456
Come on.

518
00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:53.208
You're a weak piece
of motherfucking shit.
you know that?

519
00:57:53.774 --> 00:57:55.254
She owns your ass now.

520
00:57:56.603 --> 00:57:58.126
She owns your ass now.

521
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:01.608
Come on. You want me?

522
00:58:01.608 --> 00:58:03.610
Come on. take me.
motherfucker. Come on!

523
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.483
I'll fucking beat
the fucking shit out of you.
you motherfucker!

524
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.616
They own you. motherfucker.
Look at it. Look at it.

525
00:58:09.616 --> 00:58:12.532
Look at it! Look at it!
They own you. you piece of shit.

526
00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:17.058
They own your fucking ass.

527
00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.169
<i>Come on. motherfucker. come on!</i>

528
00:58:41.866 --> 00:58:44.346
Fuck you. you piece of shit!
I'll fuck you up.

529
00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:47.045
<i>I'm gonna kill you.
you fucking piece of shit.</i>

530
00:58:47.045 --> 00:58:49.526
How'd that feel?

531
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:53.530
- How did that feel?

532
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:02.277
How's that feel?

533
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:13.114
How's that feel?
How's that feel?

534
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.138
-  Shit!

535
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:22.401
Hey!

536
01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:28.423
What?

537
01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:34.038
How come your hands
don't never get dirty?

538
01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:37.258
My hands do get dirty.

539
01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:40.174
just not the same way
as yours do. Ricky Joe.

540
01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:45.092
That ain't true. baby girl.

541
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.882
Ricky Joe acts like
he knows something.

542
01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:56.625
How come you say that?

543
01:01:58.018 --> 01:02:01.587
The way he was just
looking at me right now
and talking to me...

544
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.895
Shit was weird.

545
01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.114
Ricky Joe knows
how to fix

546
01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:08.289
any engine there is.

547
01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:10.770
Generally speaking.
he dumb as shit.

548
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.860
That's the part that worries me.

549
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.644
Dumb don't think it through.

550
01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:16.950
Dumb just does.

551
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:30.616
You look spooked.

552
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:36.274
Probably just the storm
had me up all night

553
01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:38.885
thinking about
all kinds of shit.

554
01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:42.715
Like what?

555
01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:52.246
I need to go for a ride.

556
01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.249
Where to?

557
01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.298
It don't really matter.
I just...

558
01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.519
need to let the windows
down. you know?

559
01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:11.265
- Tell you what.

560
01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:12.440
Take my ride.

561
01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:15.966
Go on. I won't need it
for a while.

562
01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:40.224
I see you. girl.

563
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:43.270
Mm. mm. mm.

564
01:05:03.508 --> 01:05:07.120
- Come on. Come on.

565
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.992
You got a little secret.
don't you. baby girl. huh?

566
01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:11.081
- You got a little secret?

567
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.213
I'm gonna fucking
outstretch you.
you're gonna get it bad. girl.

568
01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.913
-  Fucking bitch!
-  What the fuck's

569
01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.740
wrong with you?
You stupid piece of shit!

570
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.481
- All right. Easy now.

571
01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:22.005
- Here. you wanna beat on me?

572
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.703
You wanna beat on me?
You wanna beat on me like that?

573
01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:25.747
- Where is it?

574
01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.358
I want that money.
Where is it?

575
01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.533
I don't got shit.

576
01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.100
The fuck you hiding
under there?

577
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.189
Uh-huh. I knew it.

578
01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.762
- Oh. you wanna play too? Huh?

579
01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:43.678
All right. All right.

580
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.594
Come on. Come on. motherfucker.

581
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.335
Huh. look at that.

582
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.337
That's cute.

583
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.617
Piece of shit!

584
01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:12.403
Fuck. Fucking guy.

585
01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.491
Are you all right?

586
01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:16.973
"Are you all right" looks like
more of a question for you.

587
01:06:18.235 --> 01:06:19.323
Hold on. hold on.

588
01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:22.891
Do I...

589
01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:25.285
do I know you?

590
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:29.681
I don't know you.

591
01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:36.340
But thanks for...
you know.

592
01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:43.303
- Son of a gun.
- Hm.

593
01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.653
I'll be damned. The Butcher

594
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.004
standing right here
in front of me
after all these years.

595
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.527
- Yeah.
- I can't believe

596
01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:51.529
I didn't figure you out
when you came in the store.

597
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:52.878
- I've just been
standing there...
- I-I don't--

598
01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.271
...thinking about it
like an idiot.

599
01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:55.881
I'm sorry. I...

600
01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:58.840
I don't seem to recall.
My head...

601
01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:02.061
I-I'm Gunner Clark's sister.

602
01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:04.846
- Ginny.
- Gunner Clark?

603
01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:07.501
You and him used to fight
the same nights up in Memphis.

604
01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.763
Oh. yeah.

605
01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.591
Oh. God. We were all
a lot younger then.

606
01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.637
- Yeah.
- Prettier too.

607
01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:14.378
Hey. you. you're pretty.

608
01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:17.511
- You still fighting?
- Yeah.

609
01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.645
Do I look like
I could win a fight?

610
01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:23.126
Well. what you looked like
never seemed to matter much.

611
01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:25.911
Only God above
has you figured out.

612
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.956
And I bet you even
keep Him guessing.

613
01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.221
Son of a gun.

614
01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.745
Well. you be good. Jack.

615
01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:36.008
- All right. You too.
- Woo. it's hot.

616
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.265
<i>So that man out there.
he's a fighter?</i>

617
01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.745
Like boxing or...

618
01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.530
Boxing and shit.

619
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.402
He's a fighter
of the first kind.

620
01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:25.666
Nothing but air
between fist and face.

621
01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:35.241
Holy shit.

622
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.528
<i>Jack?</i>

623
01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:16.010
Jack?

624
01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.458
It's you and me. Jack.

625
01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:33.697
Hey.

626
01:12:46.927 --> 01:12:48.494
Look. I-I just wanted to...

627
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.106
thank you for. you know.
helping me out and--

628
01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:53.499
What'd you do. follow me?

629
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.764
Yeah. but I got reasons.

630
01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.070
Don't everybody.

631
01:12:59.723 --> 01:13:01.507
Hey. I got questions.

632
01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:07.339
You a cop?

633
01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.168
Do I look like one?

634
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.126
Not one I ever seen.

635
01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:16.348
The lady at the store
said you were a fighter.
is that right?

636
01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.220
Once upon a time.

637
01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:21.832
- Hold on a second.

638
01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:24.356
If you ain't a cop. I gotta go.
My daylight is running out.

639
01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:26.532
Will you just look at me
and listen to me

640
01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:28.621
- for half a damn second?

641
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.847
Dammit. Fucking truck.

642
01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.242
Son of a bitch.

643
01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.987
Looks like you need a ride.

644
01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:49.033
Yeah. Looks like I need a ride.

645
01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:00.827
Alrighty.

646
01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.006
- Do me a favor.
- What's all that?

647
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.661
Take that.

648
01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:10.620
Bring it inside.

649
01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.116
Hey. Maryann.

650
01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:33.469
Hey.

651
01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:38.952
-  Hey. Hi. Maryann.

652
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.825
Jack.

653
01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:49.310
What happened to you. Jack?

654
01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:56.404
Were the kids being rough
with you again?

655
01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:59.277
No. Maryann.

656
01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:02.498
No. I'm fine.

657
01:15:04.412 --> 01:15:05.457
I'm okay.

658
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.378
Can you put it
on the bed there?

659
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.718
You need to hear
something. Maryann.

660
01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:53.636
And you might not understand.

661
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:57.857
You might not even know
who's saying it.

662
01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.295
And that's okay.

663
01:16:04.037 --> 01:16:05.082
It's gone.

664
01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:08.215
Your family's land.

665
01:16:10.522 --> 01:16:11.567
All of it.

666
01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:19.400
The house is next...

667
01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.318
in only a few more days.

668
01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:29.323
I know I told you
I'd get you home. but...

669
01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:33.066
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to do that now.

670
01:16:34.894 --> 01:16:37.593
All I can do now is tell you...

671
01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:39.725
I'm sorry.

672
01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:45.557
But even saying it.
it sounds like bullshit.

673
01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:59.092
<i>You made me your son.</i>

674
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.141
<i>You gave it all to me.</i>

675
01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.017
<i>And I can't give
any of it back.</i>

676
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.072
You deserve to be home.

677
01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:26.772
<i>In the home
that you gave to me.</i>

678
01:17:33.213 --> 01:17:34.954
<i>I wanna tell you
I'm coming back.</i>

679
01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:40.133
<i>I wanna sit with you.</i>

680
01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:43.484
<i>tell you all the things
I never could before.</i>

681
01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.838
But I gotta go fight. Maryann.

682
01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:54.887
I'm gonna take the jewelry.

683
01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:58.978
That's all that's left
and I'm gonna beg like a dog.

684
01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:04.680
But I don't think it'll matter.

685
01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:08.858
It's gonna be a bad one.

686
01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:13.950
They're all bad.

687
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.085
But nothing like this
is gonna be.

688
01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:29.879
I don't know if I'll make it.

689
01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:36.624
I don't know
if I'm gonna see you again.

690
01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.563
You ever know a woman
named Sally Magill?

691
01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:48.827
Know her from what?

692
01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:51.264
From 25 years ago?

693
01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:55.529
Look in there if you want
but it doesn't go back that far.

694
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:57.705
I did look.

695
01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:00.360
You see her name?

696
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.406
There's nothing in here
that I can understand.

697
01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:03.407
Look.

698
01:20:04.408 --> 01:20:07.498
if this is what you're after.
I can't do it right now.

699
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.069
I can't help it.

700
01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.637
I saw you at that gas station
and that woman said

701
01:20:16.637 --> 01:20:19.205
that you were a fighter
and that your name
means "butcher."

702
01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:22.295
Those are the only two things
Sally ever told me
about my father.

703
01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:25.472
He was a fighter
and that his name
meant something.

704
01:20:25.472 --> 01:20:27.474
Yeah. everybody's name
means something.

705
01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.870
Is all that true?
That stuff you told her?

706
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:34.786
Yeah.

707
01:20:35.482 --> 01:20:37.136
Why do you have
to fight tonight?

708
01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:40.052
Long story.

709
01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:43.099
Well. it seemed
pretty damn short in there.

710
01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:45.492
Then what the hell
are you asking for
if you heard it already?

711
01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.800
I had the money
and then it was gone.

712
01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:51.759
Look.

713
01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.501
I can't tell you
what you wanna hear.

714
01:20:56.329 --> 01:20:57.287
Besides.

715
01:20:58.157 --> 01:20:59.767
I wouldn't remember you anyway.

716
01:21:23.095 --> 01:21:25.097
- What happened to it?
- What?

717
01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.405
- The money.
what happened to it?

718
01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.493
It don't matter.

719
01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:36.195
God knows I've imagined
what you might be like

720
01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:37.501
or look like.

721
01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:42.506
God knows you are way
beyond any of that.

722
01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:45.378
You haven't imagined me
because you don't know who I am.

723
01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.818
Here's what you need
to learn. Jack.

724
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.911
There is this great big world
out there spinning.

725
01:21:56.563 --> 01:21:58.826
And sometimes.
it spins with you.

726
01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:00.524
Sometimes. it spins
against you.

727
01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:02.178
But sometimes.

728
01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:04.702
it spins you right into
what you need.

729
01:22:06.138 --> 01:22:08.662
I heard what that woman said
about you being a fighter.

730
01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:12.362
So. I followed you to your house
because you're the only man.

731
01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.103
the only one I ever come across

732
01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.932
who I thought had a prayer
of being my father.

733
01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.846
- It's a long shot. I know.

734
01:22:18.846 --> 01:22:20.109
Most things are.

735
01:22:25.114 --> 01:22:27.594
I was a fighter.
I ain't anymore.

736
01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:31.294
Your story about the world
spinning around

737
01:22:31.294 --> 01:22:32.512
can't change any of that.

738
01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:41.869
Whether you believe it or not.

739
01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.263
I was sent here to help you.

740
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:50.617
I don't know. okay?
I don't know
if I'm your daughter.

741
01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:54.404
but I sure as hell know
that I'm your angel.

742
01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.276
I bet you never thought
an angel's doing

743
01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:58.538
such dirty work.

744
01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:01.672
I ain't no angel from heaven.

745
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.283
But it don't really matter
where I'm from.

746
01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:05.371
It just matters...

747
01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:07.634
that I'm here.

748
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.779
Where did you get that?

749
01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:26.958
This is another one
of those long stories.

750
01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:51.287
You are my angel.

751
01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:13.978
Better light one up
for me too.

752
01:25:17.286 --> 01:25:18.330
Oh. yeah.

753
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:46.793
Are you sure
this is right?

754
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:51.189
Yeah. it's the place.

755
01:26:24.962 --> 01:26:28.400
It's the Butcher! Jack Boucher!

756
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.837
- Keep on going.

757
01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:05.481
-  Let's go!

758
01:27:06.612 --> 01:27:09.093
Let's go. right here.
That's Jack Boucher.

759
01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:16.796
- I'll be right back.

760
01:27:16.796 --> 01:27:18.233
I'm going with you.

761
01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.538
You don't wanna go in there.

762
01:27:19.538 --> 01:27:21.627
I sure as hell don't
wanna be out here.

763
01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:24.108
Just keep the doors locked.

764
01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:29.331
And might as well keep
the engine running too.

765
01:27:38.905 --> 01:27:40.037
Hey. dog.

766
01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:45.695
Right on time.

767
01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:52.702
Who's the pretty boy?

768
01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:02.233
- What's that supposed to be?
-  It's what I owe you.

769
01:28:02.233 --> 01:28:03.495
Twelve large.

770
01:28:03.495 --> 01:28:06.063
-  You little bitch.
- Fuck you.

771
01:28:06.063 --> 01:28:07.804
- Hey. fuck you.
- Hey. how many times

772
01:28:07.804 --> 01:28:09.371
I gotta tell you to shut up?

773
01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:10.937
This don't concern you.

774
01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:14.898
I came here to fight.
That was my deal.

775
01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.900
I know you ain't
back-talking Big Momma.

776
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.728
You gonna get
to fight something.

777
01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.613
Couldn't find nobody bigger?

778
01:28:34.613 --> 01:28:36.920
The bigger they are. Jack.
Ain't that how it go?

779
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.531
That's how it goes.
But it don't matter.
You got your money.

780
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:41.664
Did it have a resurrection?

781
01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:43.535
Yeah. something like that.

782
01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:45.755
Come on. count it.

783
01:28:45.755 --> 01:28:48.323
- I don't need to.
- Good. I'm gone.

784
01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.498
Gone where?

785
01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.500
Away from here.

786
01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:06.776
That ain't how it works.
Big Momma. Even is even.

787
01:29:06.776 --> 01:29:08.430
We ain't gonna mess with you.

788
01:29:09.213 --> 01:29:10.345
You paid up.

789
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:15.045
But you should at least
have a good look outside

790
01:29:15.045 --> 01:29:16.742
before you hightail it.

791
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:22.139
Must be 500-strong.

792
01:29:24.315 --> 01:29:25.534
I don't care.

793
01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:28.885
You could make
some real money.

794
01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:29.973
I'm done.

795
01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:34.194
That ain't the Jack I know.

796
01:29:35.674 --> 01:29:39.069
The Jack I know.
eyes light up
at such a spectacle.

797
01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:42.159
The Jack I know

798
01:29:43.073 --> 01:29:45.945
make a bunch of fools
out of a whole bunch of people.

799
01:29:47.599 --> 01:29:48.644
The Jack I know

800
01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:51.516
rumbles through the dark

801
01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:54.824
like a man chasing something
he ain't never gonna catch.

802
01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:57.740
but he chases all the same.

803
01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:01.831
Knowing that there is something
out there somewhere.

804
01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:04.660
barely out of reach.

805
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.707
you can feel it on the skin
of your fingertips.

806
01:30:08.707 --> 01:30:10.970
It's so. so close.

807
01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:13.538
The Jack I know.

808
01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:18.848
always thinking.
"this could be the one."

809
01:30:21.894 --> 01:30:23.418
I've been rehabilitated.

810
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.681
Ain't no such thing.

811
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:27.596
Or I'd be out of business.

812
01:30:28.945 --> 01:30:32.775
You out of one hole. Jack.
but not the other.

813
01:30:35.386 --> 01:30:37.606
I know what you still need.

814
01:30:40.217 --> 01:30:41.871
I hear that big house

815
01:30:41.871 --> 01:30:43.394
- goes up for auction...
- Hey.

816
01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:44.830
...first of next week.

817
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:47.398
and that woman's still lying
in that other place.

818
01:30:47.398 --> 01:30:49.531
- I know where she's at.
- Mm. mm. mm.

819
01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:53.056
I also know you won't pay me
30 grand to fight
that big son of a bitch.

820
01:30:53.056 --> 01:30:55.362
You right. I won't.

821
01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:59.845
But you're a seven to one
underdog. sweetheart.

822
01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.040
So is that it?

823
01:31:22.346 --> 01:31:23.390
Hold on.

824
01:31:24.827 --> 01:31:26.785
Would you mind telling me
what the hell you're doing?

825
01:31:28.439 --> 01:31:29.527
Figuring the odds.

826
01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.399
- Of what?
- The fight.

827
01:31:33.879 --> 01:31:35.620
But you gave her
the money. right?

828
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.926
She got it.

829
01:31:37.579 --> 01:31:40.016
Well. good. Then let's get
the hell out of here.

830
01:31:40.016 --> 01:31:43.672
- Wait.

831
01:31:46.588 --> 01:31:50.069
Oh. shit. Jack. is that
who you're supposed
to be fighting tonight?

832
01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:53.029
Why the fuck you all standing
around not doing shit?

833
01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:54.552
Yeah.

834
01:31:58.164 --> 01:31:59.514
He will kill you. Jack.

835
01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:02.473
I can keep the house.

836
01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:04.127
You could get a lot worse.

837
01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:09.872
Jack. please. let's just
go back to Maryann's.

838
01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:13.745
You don't gotta do this.

839
01:32:13.745 --> 01:32:14.964
No.

840
01:32:16.313 --> 01:32:17.749
There is no in-between.

841
01:32:19.446 --> 01:32:22.798
Jack. if you get out
this damn car.

842
01:32:22.798 --> 01:32:25.409
I swear that I will
hurt you myself.

843
01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:33.243
You're an angel.

844
01:32:36.376 --> 01:32:37.682
It's gonna be all right.

845
01:32:39.728 --> 01:32:41.860
Jack. Jack!

846
01:32:49.955 --> 01:32:51.043
Seven to one?

847
01:32:51.043 --> 01:32:52.523
Seven to one.

848
01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:54.264
You gonna let me pick this up?

849
01:32:54.264 --> 01:32:56.658
I don't know.
What you think. Ern?

850
01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:59.965
I think that's the craziest
fucking White boy I ever seen.

851
01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:02.838
I reckon that means
you can pick it up.

852
01:33:03.447 --> 01:33:06.319
But when that clock strikes
midnight. Cinderella.

853
01:33:06.319 --> 01:33:08.321
there won't be no more magic.

854
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:11.629
If you lose. you still owe me.

855
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:13.370
And if I don't get my money.

856
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:15.415
you'll be laying
with Skelly in that hole

857
01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:17.200
you already dug once.

858
01:33:22.814 --> 01:33:24.033
I wanna make a bet.

859
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:35.740
I'm gonna miss you. Jack.

860
01:33:49.319 --> 01:33:50.407
What I say?

861
01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.372
What the hell is going on?

862
01:33:59.372 --> 01:34:00.765
I can't leave her there.

863
01:34:01.505 --> 01:34:03.507
I don't expect you
or nobody else to understand.

864
01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:06.815
Jesus Christ. You can't fight.

865
01:34:06.815 --> 01:34:07.990
It's done.

866
01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:10.166
What do you mean "it's done"?

867
01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:13.909
- That guy will kill you.
- I said it's done.

868
01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:15.650
- No.

869
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.608
No. come on. Jack.

870
01:34:18.174 --> 01:34:20.045
I just found you.

871
01:34:20.045 --> 01:34:22.004
You don't have to do this.

872
01:34:22.004 --> 01:34:23.701
Yeah. I do.

873
01:34:24.789 --> 01:34:28.053
No. I'm supposed to be
shoving you out of your grave.

874
01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:30.142
not dragging you back
down into it.

875
01:34:30.142 --> 01:34:32.884
- Jack.

876
01:34:32.884 --> 01:34:34.146
Look. I need you to go.

877
01:34:35.104 --> 01:34:36.279
You don't get to tell me that.

878
01:34:36.279 --> 01:34:37.584
This ain't no place for you.

879
01:34:37.584 --> 01:34:39.761
Look around. this ain't
no place for nobody.

880
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.546
You're batshit.
but I'm not leaving you.

881
01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:53.383
It's time!

882
01:34:56.865 --> 01:34:58.127
They say you could fight.

883
01:35:00.303 --> 01:35:01.913
I hope like hell it's true.

884
01:35:02.784 --> 01:35:06.265
Yeah!

885
01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:17.189
We got ourselves

886
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:18.277
Yeah!

887
01:35:18.277 --> 01:35:20.715
Are you ready?

888
01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:25.154
Make some noise
for your hostess.
Big Momma Sweet!

889
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.766
- Whoo.

890
01:35:34.032 --> 01:35:35.338
All right now.

891
01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:41.997
Whoo. look at all these fools.

892
01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:46.088
- Yeah!

893
01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:02.931
You got this. Jack.
Rip his face off!

894
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:14.029
-  Come here.
- Hey. don't touch her.

895
01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:18.685
- Damn you.
-  All you fuckers.
listen up.

896
01:36:18.685 --> 01:36:20.775
Brawling for your
pleasure tonight

897
01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.212
on this fine piece
of Delta dirt.

898
01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:25.257
busting from out
the fire-crusted...

899
01:36:25.257 --> 01:36:26.519
- ...hellscape of...

900
01:36:26.519 --> 01:36:28.826
- Annette?

901
01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:32.090
- We got in this corner. Ax.
- Yeah! Yeah!

902
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:35.224
He looks like
a big old stack of pissed-off
pork chop fucker.

903
01:36:35.224 --> 01:36:38.053
drag you down to hell
and spit you back up.

904
01:36:38.053 --> 01:36:42.535
Squaring off against
this gargantuan slab
of overcooked meat...

905
01:36:43.972 --> 01:36:47.366
coming hot out of the chute.
he's everybody's favorite.

906
01:36:47.366 --> 01:36:49.499
Jack "The Butcher" Boucher!

907
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.899
Now you know
Big Momma's rules.

908
01:36:57.899 --> 01:37:02.381
No weapons. no tricks.
just skin to skin.

909
01:37:04.253 --> 01:37:06.864
We gonna get things
started up in a hot minute.

910
01:37:06.864 --> 01:37:08.605
- but in the meantime...
-  Jack!

911
01:37:08.605 --> 01:37:10.346
...y'all place your bets.

912
01:37:10.346 --> 01:37:12.130
Seven to one.
Lay your money down.

913
01:37:13.523 --> 01:37:15.830
- Seven to one. Jack.
-  Seven-one.

914
01:37:18.093 --> 01:37:19.921
What if he wins?

915
01:37:24.795 --> 01:37:27.929
Live or die! Live or die!

916
01:37:27.929 --> 01:37:39.941
Live or die! Live or die!

917
01:37:41.246 --> 01:37:42.334
Jack!

918
01:37:42.334 --> 01:37:43.553
Live or die!

919
01:37:43.553 --> 01:37:44.684
Don't listen to them.

920
01:37:45.337 --> 01:37:46.469
Look at me.

921
01:37:50.386 --> 01:37:51.691
Look at me.

922
01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:53.780
- I'm really fucking scared.
-  Hey.

923
01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.043
Look at me. Only me.

924
01:37:55.043 --> 01:37:58.133
- It's gonna be all right.
- Let's go.

925
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:05.662
I don't wanna lose you.

926
01:38:05.662 --> 01:38:07.098
Don't be scared.

927
01:38:07.969 --> 01:38:09.274
Look at my eyes.

928
01:38:09.274 --> 01:38:11.233
I see a storm
on the horizon.

929
01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:13.235
I want the blood dripping
before the water drops.

930
01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:18.980
Only this world.

931
01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:22.244
Only this world.

932
01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.681
- Only this world.

933
01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:27.684
- Look out!

934
01:38:35.953 --> 01:38:37.737
Ooh!
That's what I'm talking about.

935
01:38:37.737 --> 01:38:39.000
- Give him some of that!

936
01:38:53.014 --> 01:38:54.929
- Yeah!

937
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:01.936
-  Oh!
-  Yeah!

938
01:39:05.591 --> 01:39:07.942
- Come on! Lets's go!

939
01:39:14.035 --> 01:39:15.253
-  Oh!

940
01:39:15.253 --> 01:39:16.907
You fucking kick his ass!

941
01:39:31.356 --> 01:39:33.315
Break his jaw. Jack. Come on.

942
01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:53.639
- Let's get it.

943
01:39:53.639 --> 01:39:56.120
Let them hands go.
Let them hands go.

944
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.607
Come on. Come on.
you motherfucker! Come on!

945
01:40:34.898 --> 01:40:36.247
Come on. Jack.

946
01:40:55.832 --> 01:40:58.052
Jack. Jack.

947
01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:05.668
Motherfucker.

948
01:41:50.582 --> 01:41:52.802
-  Come on!

949
01:41:52.802 --> 01:41:54.325
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

950
01:41:57.198 --> 01:41:59.374
Come on. Ax.

951
01:42:04.422 --> 01:42:06.163
Come on. motherfucker.

952
01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.528
Get up! Get up. Jack!

953
01:42:30.448 --> 01:42:32.450
I know he ain't getting
out of that one. Big Momma.

954
01:42:43.026 --> 01:42:44.027
Jack!

955
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.248
Yeah!

956
01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:51.121
-  Beat his ass!
-  Big Momma.
you seeing this?

957
01:43:02.698 --> 01:43:04.917
- Ow.

958
01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:06.397
How long now?

959
01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:13.143
Come on. You're not giving up.

960
01:43:13.926 --> 01:43:15.493
-  You got more.

961
01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:18.540
Stop the damn fight.
Big Momma. stop the damn fight.

962
01:43:22.674 --> 01:43:25.460
Live or die! Live or die!

963
01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:30.116
Live or die!
Live or die! Live or die!

964
01:43:54.967 --> 01:43:58.580
-  Jack!

965
01:44:37.488 --> 01:44:40.665
Mercy. Mercy!

966
01:44:41.362 --> 01:44:43.451
- Mercy. goddamn it!
-  Mercy!

967
01:44:48.499 --> 01:44:50.458
-  Mercy.
Come on! Come on!
-  Yeah!

968
01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:55.289
-  Mercy! Come on!
-  Come on. Ax. get him!

969
01:44:57.421 --> 01:45:00.598
-  Come on! Come on!
-  Come on!

970
01:45:00.598 --> 01:45:01.730
Mercy!

971
01:45:58.134 --> 01:45:59.918
-  Jack.

972
01:46:04.096 --> 01:46:05.054
Mama.

973
01:46:06.142 --> 01:46:07.099
Mama.

974
01:46:09.928 --> 01:46:11.234
I can't. Mama.

975
01:46:12.496 --> 01:46:13.889
I'm so sorry.

976
01:46:13.889 --> 01:46:15.107
It's okay.

977
01:46:17.153 --> 01:46:19.416
Mama. it's too late.

978
01:46:27.903 --> 01:46:29.165
He gonna kill me.

979
01:46:29.774 --> 01:46:30.862
Catch your breath.

980
01:46:34.126 --> 01:46:35.606
He is coming.

981
01:46:45.007 --> 01:46:46.443
It's too late.

982
01:46:48.489 --> 01:46:50.142
It's never too late.

983
01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:03.808
Bring me home.

984
01:48:25.673 --> 01:48:27.370
<i>I wish I knew
where I came from.</i>

985
01:48:33.724 --> 01:48:36.118
Never mind.
I didn't mean it.

986
01:48:37.162 --> 01:48:38.424
Yes. you did.

987
01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:42.516
That's something
you'll never truly know.

988
01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:46.520
We are always looking
for who we are.

989
01:48:47.477 --> 01:48:49.305
You. me.

990
01:48:50.306 --> 01:48:51.394
all of us.

991
01:48:52.177 --> 01:48:54.876
And that doesn't have
anything to do with your blood.

992
01:49:00.055 --> 01:49:02.274
You'll never stop wanting
to know who you are.

993
01:49:02.274 --> 01:49:05.364
And as soon as you think
you have it figured out.

994
01:49:05.364 --> 01:49:07.671
life has a way of tapping you
on the shoulder

995
01:49:07.671 --> 01:49:09.543
and shifting what you
thought you knew.

996
01:49:12.328 --> 01:49:13.982
You'll wanna know
who you are...

997
01:49:15.026 --> 01:49:17.115
today. tomorrow.
and the next day.

998
01:49:17.115 --> 01:49:18.552
for the rest of your life.

999
01:49:24.166 --> 01:49:25.559
And that's good. Jack.

1000
01:49:28.474 --> 01:49:29.780
Some days. you'll think about it

1001
01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.303
more than other days.

1002
01:49:34.393 --> 01:49:37.005
It'd be sad to me if you
didn't think about it at all.

1003
01:49:56.502 --> 01:49:58.113
Now what do you see out there?

1004
01:50:02.421 --> 01:50:03.901
I don't know what I see.

1005
01:50:09.037 --> 01:50:10.604
That's why we keep looking.
