[♪♪]

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.208
[Emilia] Well.
the first thing

5
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.375
you have to understand is--

6
00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:20.250
romance isn't all about
cleverly plotted meet-cutes

7
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.458
and low-stakes
misunderstandings

8
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:22.625
easily resolved

9
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.917
over the course
of a musical montage.

10
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.458
Don't get me wrong.
Those work.

11
00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.166
I-I love those stories.

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.333
I just-- I think there's room

13
00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:33.250
for other types
of love stories. too.

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.750
[ball rumbles]

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.417
[pins clatter]

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.542
Money!

17
00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.083
-Okay. Okay.
-Act like you know me.

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.917
[chuckling]

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.333
[Emilia] Some duos might
look like the perfect pairing.

20
00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:45.875
outwardly...

21
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.583
-[keys clicking]
-[whoosh]

22
00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.375
-...when. in fact...

23
00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.208
-[crashing]
-...they're headed for a split.

24
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:53.208
All right.

25
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:56.125
-Hey.
-Hey.

26
00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.792
[Emilia] Often. the most
satisfying stories are the ones

27
00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.291
that subvert your expectations.

28
00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.250
[snap]

29
00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:06.333
[thudding]

30
00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:07.250
Because the truth is.

31
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.667
the most romantic stories...

32
00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.291
...are often
the least typical.

33
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:13.875
[♪♪]

34
00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.083
You see. researchers
studying online dating

35
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.291
discovered
if a person's too focused

36
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:23.542
on checking off a list of
rigid criteria in a partner.

37
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.583
if they're too fixated

38
00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.000
on finding a--

39
00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:27.750
quote. unquote--
"soulmate."

40
00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.083
they're likely to miss out
on their true complement.

41
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.375
a partner whose differences
fit their own

42
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.375
like interwoven fingers.

43
00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:34.500
creating a firm lock.

44
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:36.750
[man] Hey. watch
where you're going.

45
00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.667
Sorry. The sidewalk
is for sharing.

46
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.083
[Emilia] A romantic character
shouldn't be flawless.

47
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.458
They need complexities.
Depth.

48
00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.000
It's their growth
along the way

49
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:48.375
that makes them truly worth
an epic love story.

50
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:49.834
Uh. excuse me?

51
00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:51.250
-Hey.
-Hi!

52
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.458
You took my coffee.

53
00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:54.834
Thanks.

54
00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:56.709
[Emilia] Well. that's
my philosophy. anyway.

55
00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:58.542
and it's served me well.

56
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.208
Can't argue with

57
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:02.333
the New York Times'
best-seller list.

58
00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:03.917
[drover] Ma'am.
sorry to interrupt.

59
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.750
but we've arrived.

60
00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:06.792
If you've changed your mind.

61
00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:07.667
I can take you
back to the airport.

62
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.750
No. no. no.

63
00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:10.375
It's really now or never.

64
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.208
[♪♪]

65
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.125
Ms. Emilia Bloom.

66
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.250
You know. I've been trying

67
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.625
to keep a bit of
a lower profile these days.

68
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.583
We are honored to have
Pennfield's best-selling author

69
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.792
staying here
with us this week.

70
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:32.041
I hope this means
you'll be doing

71
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.875
a reading
from your latest book?

72
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.166
The romance fans
of Pennfield

73
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.625
finally convinced my publisher
to send me home.

74
00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.709
[chuckles]

75
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.458
I believe we reserved
the penthouse?

76
00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:42.250
Yes. Ms. Bloom.

77
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.792
And of course. you have access
to all of our amenities.

78
00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:45.917
-Mm.
-That includes

79
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.625
our top-of-the-line gym--

80
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.959
Won't be needing that.

81
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:50.959
As well as our martini bar.

82
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.750
Mm. Much more my speed.

83
00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.417
[both chuckling]

84
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.709
Could I...
have my key. then?

85
00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:00.208
[gasps] Oh!

86
00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:02.041
So sorry.

87
00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.166
You wouldn't mind signing this
for me. would you?

88
00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:10.083
Who should I make it out to?

89
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:11.208
[♪♪]

90
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.792
[Taylor] "The Bloomeria."

91
00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.250
I sent an email last week.

92
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.542
but I'm still waiting

93
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.875
on a shipment of
12 artisanal planters.

94
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.709
two cases of assorted crystals.

95
00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:22.709
and. uh...

96
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:24.208
let me think. um--

97
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.500
Terrariums?

98
00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:27.417
Yes! 12 glass terrariums.
Thank you.

99
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.125
Uh. if I could speak
to a real human being

100
00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.458
instead of an inbox.

101
00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:33.458
maybe we could sort this out?

102
00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.417
Thank you.

103
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:38.750
Hannah. how is that you can

104
00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:39.917
follow my conversation.

105
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.333
update your socials.

106
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.375
and watch the front of the store
all at the same time?

107
00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.959
Gen Z.
Digital native at your service.

108
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:47.583
Did you clean the potting area?

109
00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:48.709
Yep.

110
00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:49.417
Switch out
the front-window displays?

111
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.458
Obviously.

112
00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:51.792
Water the succulents?

113
00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:53.333
Trick question.
They're on a biweekly schedule.

114
00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:55.083
Listen. I can't help it

115
00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.834
if the rapid development
of new tech

116
00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.750
has shaped me into
a flawless multitasker.

117
00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:00.625
It's a blessing and a curse.

118
00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.792
What are you posting. anyway?

119
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.834
Most recently?

120
00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:06.041
Our sticky-fingered friend.

121
00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.083
What am I looking at?

122
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.375
The Classifie app?

123
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.583
There's. like. a million apps.
How am I supposed to keep track?

124
00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:14.709
Exactly why
you'd love this one.

125
00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.208
Sort of an all-in-one--

126
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:18.875
local events and dating stuff
rolled into one.

127
00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:22.250
And. uh. shaming
local shoplifters?

128
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.709
Exactly.

129
00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:25.625
Like a bulletin board
for the neighborhood.

130
00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.542
Digital classifieds.

131
00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.542
Okay. this guy's looking for
pictures of feet.

132
00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:32.542
No. thank you.

133
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:33.959
Come on. Taylor.

134
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:36.458
Every neighborhood
has its endearing weirdos.

135
00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.333
Not all the posts
are like that.

136
00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:39.834
You should seriously consider

137
00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:41.834
advertising The Bloomeria
on here.

138
00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.375
A bunch of local shops do it.

139
00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:46.208
Between Two Covers posts
for all their in-store events.

140
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.834
-Really?
-Check it out.

141
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.625
"Calling all book lovers.

144
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:56.458
-What're they giving away?
-I don't know.

145
00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.500
Naughty bookmarks. maybe?
That's not the point.

146
00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:01.041
The point is.
it draws in new customers.

147
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.834
I will think about it.

148
00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:05.375
You know you won't.
Just say you won't.

149
00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:07.041
I will think about it!

150
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.333
[♪♪]

151
00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:12.333
Okay. so I know that we've gone
back and forth on this

152
00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.083
a few times.

153
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:17.125
but I really think this design
is gonna do the trick.

154
00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.291
I think it captures the spirit

155
00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.625
and the-the energy

156
00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.291
that. uh. Between Two Covers
has. um. uh...

157
00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:26.041
brought back to the Pennfield
business district. you know?

158
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.208
It's bold.

159
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.166
It's graphic.
and i-it announces...

160
00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:33.875
"We sell books here."

161
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.667
So. you know. that's. uh...

162
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.500
I'd be ready start
priming the wall

163
00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:39.750
just as soon as. you know.

164
00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:41.458
you give me the go-ahead
on the design.

165
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:42.667
And I want to sign off.

166
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.917
I told you.
the owner is very particular--

167
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.709
I have to clear everything
past them.

168
00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:49.041
Right. Yeah. This mysterious
owner that I've never met.

169
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:50.333
What can I say?
They're a private person.

170
00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:53.917
Yeah. So we're 100% sure
that they exist. right?

171
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.041
This isn't some ploy

172
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.417
I've made up
to frustrate you. Zach.

173
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.250
Trust me. I have better ways
to spend my time. too.

174
00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:01.750
[phone keys clicking]

175
00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:03.542
Is everything okay?

176
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.375
Bowling league drama.

177
00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:07.667
You know. they lured me in with
their clever Classifie post.

178
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.375
but it's only been a month.

179
00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:10.583
and there's already in-fighting

180
00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:11.875
over the lane assignments
at Langford Lanes.

181
00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:12.917
[chuckles]

182
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.542
Langford Lanes.

183
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.250
Wow. Used to love that place.

184
00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:19.125
Um...

185
00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.625
so when do you think
I can get an answer on these?

186
00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.792
Uh. soon.
Hopefully. definitely soon.

187
00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:28.291
So. is it. like.
a singles' thing. or...?

188
00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:31.208
No. It's not a singles' thing.

189
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.291
Why is it that everyone assumes
a single woman

190
00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.333
with a fulfilling career
and an active social life

191
00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.792
is still on the hunt for a man?

192
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.208
-No. I didn't really mean--
-...I'm stuck at home

193
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.834
with my five long-haired cats.
watching bridal shows.

194
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.291
and dreaming of the day

195
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.875
some man will save me
from my lonely spinster life?

196
00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.125
I love those shows!

197
00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:48.458
I only have one cat.

198
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.166
She requires a lot less feeding
than a boyfriend.

199
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.125
I like my life!

200
00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:53.750
[Zach] Yeah.

201
00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:55.375
Got it. Sure. Um...

202
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.417
Just bowling. Yep.

203
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.375
That's all I'm saying.

204
00:06:58.458 --> 00:06:59.417
Yeah. I guess
I just thought that Classifie

205
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.583
was like a dating app. so...

206
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:04.041
Some people use it that way.
I don't.

207
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.583
Well. who needs
that headache. right?

208
00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.041
Sorry I went a bit off there.

209
00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:10.750
No. No. no.

210
00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:11.917
I'd say it was very. uh...
uh...

211
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.083
Hostile?

212
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.875
No. No.
I-I was gonna say "righteous."

213
00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.417
[flustered] Uh...

214
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.667
we'll get...
back to you on these.

215
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.125
-Yes.
-Uh. uh...

216
00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:23.250
-Free bookmark... [chuckles]
-Great.

217
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:24.166
...for your troubles?

218
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.834
All right.

219
00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.208
[groans]

220
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.166
You ever read through
two of these and realize

221
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.125
the posters are actually perfect
for each other.

222
00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.667
if only they'd connect
and figure it out?

223
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.917
Yeah. I think you overestimate
the amount of time I spend

224
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.792
thinking about the love lives
of strangers on an app.

225
00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:41.500
Like-- Like this one.

226
00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:42.709
They're asking for advice

227
00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:44.458
on starting
an urban vegetable garden.

228
00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.375
this one wants to meet up
with local vegans.

229
00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:47.834
How perfect is that?

230
00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:49.917
Let me see that. okay?

231
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.041
Neither of these people

232
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:53.000
is looking for
a romantic connection.

233
00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:54.375
Franki.

234
00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.417
Everybody's looking
for a romantic connection.

235
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.667
even the vegans.

236
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.875
Please tell me you don't
message these people?

237
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.792
Um... ahem.

238
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:04.125
Yeah. very selectively. Yeah.

239
00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:06.750
You are like
a nosy grandmother!

240
00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:08.959
My online persona is more...

241
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:11.208
"hard-to-nail-down
man of mystery."

242
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.583
Maybe I'm available.

243
00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:13.959
Maybe I'm not.

244
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.542
Maybe you're delusional. yeah?

245
00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.458
[laughing]

246
00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:20.333
Ah...

247
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.792
'kay. this person.
for example.

248
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.083
needs me.

249
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:25.208
They're never gonna find
their soulmate

250
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.041
with a post like this.

251
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.583
"Ready to bloom
where I'm planted--

252
00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.583
creative soul
seeks deeper connections."

253
00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:32.834
Translation--

254
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:34.834
"I'm a friendless loner
whose therapist says

255
00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:36.542
I need to put myself
out there more."

256
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.166
-[laughing]
-They need me!

257
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.250
You are reading way too much
into that.

258
00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.291
Oh. really?
It continues.

259
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.041
"Let's share
all Pennfield has to offer."

260
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.834
That's-- That's...
What is wrong with that?

261
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:47.875
[shocked] What?

262
00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:48.875
What is wrong with that?

263
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:49.792
That's too transactional!

264
00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.458
Translation--

265
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.500
"I don't care
how cheap this date is.

266
00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.041
we're still
splitting the bill."

267
00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.041
Okay. now you're just
twisting their words.

268
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.834
-[sighs]
-No. These people aren't...

269
00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.000
desperate.

270
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.875
Maybe just cliché.

271
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.625
This is why
you're still single.

272
00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:06.041
No. that is not why I'm single.

273
00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:09.959
God. just promise me
you won't message that guy.

274
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:11.166
Excuse me?

275
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.709
Francesca...

276
00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:16.291
this sad. ineffective post
was clearly written by a woman.

277
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.959
"I'm ready to blossom
where I'm planted?"

278
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:20.542
Come on.
that screams Georgia O'Keeffe.

279
00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:24.458
[laughing] Okay.
Well. man. woman-- whoever--

280
00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:26.208
they're just looking
for some company.

281
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:27.750
Okay? Nothing wrong with that.

282
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:31.166
Okay. if that's how you feel...

283
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.291
[whoosh]

284
00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:33.625
...she's within
a five-mile radius.

285
00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:34.709
[whoosh]

286
00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:35.875
Go get her. Franki.

287
00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:37.458
N-- No! You know what?

288
00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:38.917
I-I don't have the time.

289
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.417
Between work

290
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.875
and my extremely
high-maintenance friendships.

291
00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.542
my plate is full.

292
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:45.792
[clink]

293
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.208
Besides. there's no algorithm
on Earth

294
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:50.542
that can accurately predict
romantic compatibility.

295
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.125
You're right.

296
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:54.375
It's all... chemistry.

297
00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:56.041
[wailful sax theme rises]

298
00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.542
It's like...
taking a seat at the local bar.

299
00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.667
striking up a conversation
with a handsome stranger...

300
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.250
What can I get you?

301
00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:03.709
Mm...

302
00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.792
let's talk gin.

303
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.500
Now. my know-it-all editor

304
00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.834
says I need to incorporate
more social media into my books.

305
00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:13.500
Says it's so ubiquitous
these days.

306
00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.250
that a world without it
is entirely too fictional.

307
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:19.333
So you're catfishing locals
as you travel from town to town?

308
00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:20.667
Excuse me?

309
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.750
I am doing research
while I'm on my book tour.

310
00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:25.208
Ah.
Professional catfishing. then.

311
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.500
I am not trying
to fool anybody.

312
00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:29.542
or pretending
to be somebody else.

313
00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:31.542
The last thing
I'm looking for is love.

314
00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:33.375
I want access.

315
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.792
Yeah? Access to what?
Banking information?

316
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:37.208
No. I'm good there.

317
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.583
I bet you are.

318
00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:40.417
People's hopes...

319
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.125
and dreams...

320
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.667
and hangups.

321
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.125
You know?

322
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.917
To my editor's point--
we all live online these days.

323
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.583
You know. we're not individuals
so much as usernames

324
00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:54.250
that are connected to a catalog
of things that we consume--

325
00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:58.709
like. TV. movies...
organic dishwashing detergent.

326
00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:02.000
There's no accidental discovery.

327
00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:03.083
You know?

328
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.291
And it's life
through a filter.

329
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:05.625
-and it's just...
-It's kind of superficial?

330
00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:06.959
Exactly!

331
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.417
Given the opportunity

332
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.291
for some good old-fashioned.
analog exchange.

333
00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.166
you can get somebody
to confess

334
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.625
their deepest longings and fears
in no time.

335
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.083
Mm.

336
00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:21.000
I'm sure you run across that
in your line of work--

337
00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:23.417
a stranger comes in.
bellies up to the bar.

338
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.375
-and starts--
-Oversharing?

339
00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:27.417
-It happens all the time.
-Mm-hmm.

340
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.792
See?

341
00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:32.083
We are all starving
for real. tangible connection.

342
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:35.583
Like this poster--
"Ready to Bloom."

343
00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:38.041
Sounds dreamy. Next!

344
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:39.458
Uh. no!

345
00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:41.041
Lonely is great.

346
00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:42.834
There is always a story there.

347
00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:44.625
So...

348
00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.291
"Dear Ready to Bloom--"

349
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.709
Oh. that's a good start.

350
00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.750
"I have just landed in town

351
00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.166
and I need a tour guide."

352
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.417
-Oh?
-Is that good?

353
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.208
It's a little on-the-nose.
but sure.

354
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.583
Okay. "Would you like
to see your city

355
00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:02.291
through a stranger's eyes?"

356
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:04.542
Wait. I thought
you used to live here.

357
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.000
Uh. yeah. but that was
a long time ago.

358
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.125
Anyway.
I'm just casting a line.

359
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:10.583
and seeing if anything catches.

360
00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.250
Cheers.

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:13.542
-[phone buzzes]
-Oh.

362
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.875
Looks like Mr. Lonely was
waitin' by his phone.

363
00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:19.709
Wow. That was fast.

364
00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:21.291
[Max] You can never know

365
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.834
where the first moment
of connection could lead.

366
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:24.291
Maybe he's married. or--

367
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:25.500
Or a serial killer.

368
00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:26.667
Or straight.

369
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.041
[laughing] Or straight!

370
00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:32.333
You just never know until
you put yourself out there.

371
00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:33.834
[phone alert chimes]

372
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.208
What is that.
an exciting new prospect?

373
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.291
It's hard to say.

374
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.875
-Let's see!
-It's hard to say!

375
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:44.250
So. sometimes. you gotta.
you know. take it offline.

376
00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:46.000
Is that all
you're gonna give me?

377
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:47.750
No more juicy details
for you. Frankie. 'Kay?

378
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.083
You need to stop
living vicariously

379
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.083
and go have an adventure
of your own.

380
00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:54.166
But I... I love juicy details.
You know this about me.

381
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.542
I gotta take off.

382
00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:57.583
-All right.

383
00:12:57.667 --> 00:12:59.458
I'll see ya.

00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:21.583
Hey. go ahead and clock out.

387
00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.458
I'll lock up.

388
00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:29.166
A whole ten minutes early?

389
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.667
What. have you been
body-swapped by aliens?

390
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.750
No. It's slow for customers.

391
00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:36.959
and my brother
just punked on family dinner.

392
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:39.959
so I'm just gonna order takeout

393
00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:43.458
and make sure that I've watched
everything made for TV.

394
00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:45.917
Alternatively. you could.
I don't know.

395
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
maybe try to have fun?

396
00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:50.375
Ah. fun is for your twenties.

397
00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:51.875
Go.

398
00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:54.750
Make some questionable decisions
for the both of us.

399
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.834
I will try my best.

400
00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:58.959
See ya tomorrow. boss.

401
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:01.083
Goodnight. honey.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.667
Thank you.

405
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.125
You're hitting it off with
the lonely local. aren't you?

406
00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:18.458
No. he's funny.
[laughs]

407
00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:21.166
He's a little awkward. but...
but funny.

408
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.500
It's strange. because he kind of
reminds me of my husband.

409
00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:24.959
You're married?

410
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.792
I was.

411
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:28.417
Oh. don't worry.

412
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.625
He's dead now.

413
00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:31.166
-Oh.
-I invited. uh.

414
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.000
"Ready to Bloom"
to come and join us.

415
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:34.542
What. you invited them here?

416
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:35.792
Yeah. well. you have to meet
a stranger in a public place--

417
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.166
that's just common sense.

418
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.041
Now we just wait

419
00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:40.625
and see who walks
through that door.

420
00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:47.166

[whoosh]

426
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:59.208
I am so going to regret this.

427
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.208
[barkeep] Well?

428
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.083
Any updates?

429
00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:03.709
Radio silence.

430
00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:05.959
-Boo.
-Yeah. I'm calling it a night.

431
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:08.709
It seems that my lonely local
has not been enticed.

432
00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:09.917
[chuckles]

433
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.875
Or maybe he slipped in
just under the wire.

434
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.166
Mom?

435
00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:22.834
What're you doing here?

436
00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.041
When did you get here?

437
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.792
What. are you visiting.
or staying?

438
00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:30.208
Why didn't you text or--

439
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.750
It was a last-minute addition
to my book tour and...

440
00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:35.083
I was gonna reach out
first thing tomorrow!

441
00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:36.375
Hello. hello!

442
00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:37.875
-[chuckling]
-Ah.

443
00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:39.917
So your publisher finally
sent you to Pennfield?

444
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.375
Yeah. well. you know. it's not
always about the total reach.

445
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.458
but the level of enthusiasm.

446
00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:47.083
They thought that
a passionate hometown crowd

447
00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:49.792
would generate excellent press
for my latest release.

448
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:50.792
Well...

449
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:53.166
welcome home.

450
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.125
Are you staying here?

451
00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:57.208
Mm. The penthouse suite.

452
00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:59.041
Well. why don't you just
stay at the house?

453
00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:00.792
I mean.
there's plenty of space.

454
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.458
I left your room the same--
your shoes. Dad's ties.

455
00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:05.792
Oh. [stammers] You know.
I wouldn't want to impose or--

456
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:08.625
Ahem. But look at you!
You look so handsome.

457
00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:11.417
I mean. what are you doing here?
Are you meeting someone? A date?

458
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.709
Um...

459
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:15.458
I-I w-- I was. yeah. kind of.

460
00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.792
Oh? Look at me.
Wrecking your plans already.

461
00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.208
Well. where is she. then?

462
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:21.667
I don't know. um...

463
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.041
it's kind of
an unconventional setup.

464
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.166
Oh. a blind date?

465
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.917
On Classifie...

466
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.333
actually.

467
00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:30.166
Oh?

468
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.834
Yeah. I don't know
what she looks like.

469
00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.291
I don't even know her name.

470
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:35.166
She just told me
to meet her at the bar

471
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.041
and she likes gin martinis.

472
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.667
[♪♪]

473
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.250
She's not coming.

474
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.750
You're "Ready to Bloom."
aren't you?

475
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.709
Oh... no.

476
00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:52.291
No. no! No. No.
Don't be embarrassed.

477
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.500
No. I think that these things
probably happen all the time.

478
00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:56.417
What? To who?

479
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.542
I finally post to that app
and I pick up my mom

480
00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:00.000
who doesn't even
live here anymore?

481
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:02.125
You know what? I think that
it proves that you and I.

482
00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:03.125
we're compatible.

483
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.375
-Mom!
-What?

484
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.208
Wait. Why are you even
on the Classifie app?

485
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.417
I mean.
are you dating again?

486
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.583
W-- [balks]

487
00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.959
First of all.
don't look so horrified.

488
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.250
No. I'm not.

489
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:15.959
I am just doing research
for my-my-- my book.

490
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.166
That's all.

491
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.959
You're catfishing strangers
for research?

492
00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:20.291
[mutters]
That's what I said.

493
00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:21.959
[scoffs and sighs]

494
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:25.291
Wait. Does Taylor even know
that you're here?

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:28.458

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:19.000
Right. Clearly.

I was worried that
you might be too cool for me.

But thanks for putting
my mind at ease.

We weren't expecting you. Yet.

527
00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:05.375
But I confirmed the dates
with your publisher and. um...

[stressed chuckle]

529
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:07.959
[mutters] Emilia Bloom.

530
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.083
And do you have a name?

Yes.

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:13.709
Uh. Margot! Heh.

-Manager.
-Ah!

Well. Margot the Manager.

536
00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:18.458
I came in a few days early

537
00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:20.625
to make the most of
this last stop on my tour.

538
00:20:20.709 --> 00:20:22.667
You may know that I lived
in Pennfield for many years.

I know everything about you.

540
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:27.083
[laughs] I mean. everything
that is normal to know.

541
00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.875
Okay. well. I am looking

542
00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:30.625
for a little hole-in-the-wall
jewelry shop

543
00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:32.542
where my husband
used to buy me things.

544
00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:33.750
and I feel certain

545
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:35.917
that it is just
right around here somewhere.

546
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
It was just
right around the corner.

547
00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:38.458
Oh!

548
00:20:38.542 --> 00:20:41.250
But they went out of business.
About three-ish years ago?

549
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:44.125
Three years? Really?

550
00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:46.709
Yeah. uh.
it's a coffee shop now.

551
00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:48.709
Super-cute.

552
00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:51.834
I can. uh. take you there.
if you want.

553
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.500
Uh...

554
00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:55.041
are-aren't you
supposed to be working?

555
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:56.667
-Oh!
-Yeah.

556
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.959
I think you should stay working.

557
00:20:58.041 --> 00:20:59.458
and you should
get everybody very excited

558
00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.000
about my book reading. okay?

559
00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:02.500
Okay. I am.
I mean. we are!

560
00:21:02.583 --> 00:21:03.667
All of us.

561
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.500
[laughing] Okay.

562
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:06.709
Oh. actually. Margot?

563
00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:08.625
-Yes. Ms. Bloom?
-Um...

564
00:21:08.709 --> 00:21:12.000
do you happen
to have some water?

565
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:15.709
'Cause I forgot to take...
my vitamins.

566
00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:16.834
[laughs]

567
00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:29.250
[shaky breath. exhales tensely]

568
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.750
[♪♪]

569
00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.250
I. uh...

570
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:36.834
I'm not sure why I...

571
00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:39.125
Sorry.
I'm-I'm-- I'm Taylor.

572
00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:41.166
Yeah. you thought I was a guy.
didn't you?

573
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.750
No.

574
00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.041
I mean...

575
00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:45.834
Yes. Yes. I did.

576
00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:47.333
-Guilty.
-No. It's all good.

577
00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:49.333
It happens all the time
in my line of work.

578
00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:51.583
Which is...
personal training?

579
00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:53.417
[laughing] No!

580
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.792
I'm flattered. but no.
I'm...

581
00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:58.792
Sorry. Just the screen-name--
"HeartIsAMuscle"?

582
00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:01.041
Yeah. I-I'm a doctor.
Cardiologist.

583
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:03.333
-A doctor?
-Yeah.

584
00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:04.959
I've got the MD
and the med school debt

585
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:06.208
to prove it.

586
00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.458
That's great.

587
00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:10.709
Not the debt part. Um...

588
00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:12.792
Hey. Taylor. if. um.

589
00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:15.000
if you're not interested--
in coffee--

590
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.333
you just say the word.

591
00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:17.667
Personally. I love coffee.

592
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.500
so I'm fine with my latte
either way.

593
00:22:25.667 --> 00:22:28.291
Ah!

594
00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:29.917
-Margot?
-Mm-hmm?

595
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.041
Is everything okay?

596
00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:32.166
[giggles]

597
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.959
I just met Emilia... Bloom.

598
00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:36.041
Already?

599
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.542
I-I thought
you confirmed the dates?

600
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.709
I did. uh.
but she's in town early

601
00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:42.291
and she just-- ha!
...casually swung by.

602
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:43.333
Is she still in the shop?

603
00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:44.542
No. she just left.

604
00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:47.166
But she is exactly like
I always imagined--

605
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.333
smart and glamorous.

606
00:22:49.417 --> 00:22:50.917
Ha!
Total force of nature.

607
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.375
[chuckles]

608
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:54.750
Oh. did you...
did you want to meet her?

609
00:22:54.834 --> 00:22:57.041
I'm sorry. you're usually
a behind-the-scenes guy.

610
00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:58.417
No! No. no. I-It's fine.

611
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.000
Actually. it's for the best.

612
00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:01.417
We've already met.

613
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.417
You know Emilia Bloom?

614
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.542
[bangs desk]
Why didn't you say something?

615
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:10.792
Well. because I don't
actually "know her" know her.

616
00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:13.291
Not anymore.

617
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:14.917
[sighs] Anyway.

618
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.500
This design doesn't really...

619
00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:19.208
show what makes us special.

620
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:20.709
But we're a bookstore.

621
00:23:20.792 --> 00:23:21.750
Yeah.

622
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.709
I'd like him
to take another pass.

623
00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:26.750
Less books.

624
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:29.208
I'll let him down gently.

625
00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:35.750
[♪♪]

626
00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:37.250
[Franki]
So you really had no idea?

627
00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.959
No. How could I?
It's anonymous.

628
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:42.542
Well. my best friend. Max.
is convinced that he can tell--

629
00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:46.458
like. age. gender.
level of desperation...

630
00:23:46.542 --> 00:23:48.917
Well. I am happy
to prove him wrong--

631
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.458
if you guys have that kind of.
you know.

632
00:23:50.542 --> 00:23:52.083
casual. competitive friendship.

633
00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.834
Oh. yeah. definitely.
Ever since pre-med.

634
00:23:53.917 --> 00:23:55.333
Mm.

635
00:23:55.417 --> 00:23:57.750
How is the latte.
by the way?

636
00:23:57.834 --> 00:23:59.166
Delicious.

637
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.166
You know. I've been meaning
to come in here for ages.

638
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.834
My shop
is right around the corner.

639
00:24:02.917 --> 00:24:04.125
but it's just--

640
00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:05.834
it's hard to get away
during work hours.

641
00:24:05.917 --> 00:24:08.333
It's my first year in business.

642
00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:10.166
so it's kind of make-or-break.

643
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.458
You don't have any help?

644
00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:12.375
No. I do.

645
00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:14.083
I have a college junior

646
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:15.792
who might just be better
at my job than I am.

647
00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:16.709
Mm.

648
00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:18.250
It's just. I--

649
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.458
You like being in control.

650
00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:22.542
Yeah.

651
00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.000
Yeah. I guess I do.

652
00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:27.792
Um. so. your post actually
really resonated

653
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:30.542
with. uh.
being a fellow workaholic.

654
00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:33.375
Now. I really think
that we should re-frame it

655
00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:35.583
as "high-achieving
and detail-oriented."

656
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.083
Mm?

657
00:24:37.166 --> 00:24:38.875
Yeah. there's plenty of people
who get total fulfillment

658
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:40.083
from their work.

659
00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.750
I wish I got total fulfillment.

660
00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:44.417
I think. at this point.
it's mostly just total fear.

661
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.417
Oh?

662
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.458
Yeah. I'm not. obviously.

663
00:24:47.542 --> 00:24:48.709
dealing with
life-or-death stakes

664
00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:49.875
the way you are.

665
00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:53.792
but my business
does consume my life.

666
00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:55.917
I'm there morning till night.

667
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.750
and then.
even when I'm not there.

668
00:24:58.834 --> 00:25:00.667
I'm just worried that it's.
you know. catching fire.

669
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.792
or getting robbed.

670
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:04.750
or failing.

671
00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:08.667
Wow. I really need to see
this flower shop now.

672
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.208
[laughs]

673
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:11.917
You know. it's actually
more of a. um.

674
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.083
plant store
and artisanal goods boutique.

675
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.166
[chuckles]

676
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.417
But... you're welcome any time.

677
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.125
All right.

678
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.500
I have a question for you.

679
00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:24.083
Shoot.

680
00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:26.917
I don't want to offend
or anything--

681
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.542
[chuckles]
It's gonna be a good one. then.

682
00:25:30.625 --> 00:25:33.125
Why did you post
in the first place?

683
00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:35.959
Uh. you know. you seem
to have a great career

684
00:25:36.041 --> 00:25:37.959
and incredible friends.

685
00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:40.208
Don't people try to set you up
all the time?

686
00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:42.291
Most of the time.
it's really just my patients

687
00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:43.750
trying to set me up
with their grandkids.

688
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:45.333
[chuckles]

689
00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:47.083
And always women?

690
00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:49.375
Are you asking
who they try to set me up with.

691
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:51.709
or who I would actually
take out?

692
00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:55.375
The latter. I guess.

693
00:25:56.667 --> 00:26:00.291
I had girlfriends in college
and. um...

694
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:02.709
dated women here and there
throughout med school.

695
00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:06.667
And. um. it-it just got easier

696
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.834
to be a fantastic physician
than a fantastic partner.

697
00:26:09.917 --> 00:26:11.750
I think now I finally
have my feet under me.

698
00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:15.458
and if I don't put myself
back out there now...

699
00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:17.667
maybe I never will.

700
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.458
Uh. who knows.

701
00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:21.166
Maybe there's someone out there
who feels the same

702
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.959
and. you know. wants to--

703
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.250
[overlapping]
...Share a life together?

704
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.458
Yeah. that. or I was gonna say

705
00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:28.875
just a nice bottle of wine
and a movie?

706
00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:30.375
Oh! Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:33.458
That sounds more... sane.

708
00:26:33.542 --> 00:26:36.333
Light and spontaneous. Right?

709
00:26:36.417 --> 00:26:39.500
I can't remember the last time
I did something spontaneous.

710
00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:41.625
Doesn't this count?

711
00:26:42.709 --> 00:26:44.792
Yeah. I guess it does.

712
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:47.375
Well. good.

713
00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:49.000
Look at you.

714
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:52.250
Look at me.
Look at us.

715
00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:53.500
[chuckling]

716
00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:55.625
[♪♪]

717
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:02.041
[Zach sighs]

718
00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:10.667
[exhales wearily]

719
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.917
[whump]

720
00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:14.583
[Hannah] Hope you don't mind--
I had to open without you.

721
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:16.375
I texted.

722
00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:17.583
Did you?

723
00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:20.417
Hmm! I didn't notice.

724
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.166
It looks great. though.

725
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.417
You never let me open solo.

726
00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:25.417
No?

727
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.917
No.

728
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.208
Are you okay?

729
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.125
Yeah. I'm great. I...

730
00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:33.041
I don't know.
Maybe I'm over-caffeinated?

731
00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:34.375
No.

732
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.333
You're. like. the opposite
of over-caffeinated.

733
00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:38.792
Where's my real boss?

734
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:41.917
The one who likes to shelve
the aloe plants by height?

735
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.250
She's just trying to be
more open to things.

736
00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:45.542
You know?

737
00:27:45.625 --> 00:27:47.041
But do not touch
the aloe plants.

738
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.542
[door bell jingles]

739
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:49.583
Want me to get that?

740
00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.500
Nah. I got it.

741
00:27:54.834 --> 00:27:56.333
Mom.

742
00:27:56.417 --> 00:27:57.500
Look at this place!

743
00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:58.959
You really did it!

744
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.041
What are you doing here?

745
00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:02.375
Well. I thought it was time

746
00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:05.834
to come and see what
my children have been up to.

747
00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:07.375
And...

748
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:09.542
I mean. uh. just look at this!

749
00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:12.250
The pots and the plants and...

750
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:14.291
it's just fantastic.

751
00:28:14.375 --> 00:28:18.041
And you really look the part of
a scrappy young business owner.

752
00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.959
Because I am. Mom.
This is not a costume.

753
00:28:21.041 --> 00:28:22.458
No. no.

754
00:28:22.542 --> 00:28:25.208
It sure is not.
Of course. I know that.

755
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:27.667
It's so great
to see you. Taylor.

756
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.542
I really missed you.

757
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.667
Miss Bloom.

758
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.000
-Oh. hi.
-Hi. I'm Hannah.

759
00:28:33.083 --> 00:28:34.792
Nice to meet you.

760
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:37.583
Taylor didn't mention
you were coming to Pennfield.

761
00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.750
Well. um. I'm--
I'm really just passing through.

762
00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.750
In fact. you should come
to my reading

763
00:28:42.834 --> 00:28:44.041
at Between Two Covers--

764
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.542
-Ah.
-...Later this week.

765
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:47.583
Now it makes sense.

766
00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:51.041
I wanted to invite
you and Zach personally.

767
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:53.583
Ah. wow. That's so nice.

768
00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:56.333
Sort of how I invited you
to my grand opening.

769
00:28:56.417 --> 00:28:59.291
Oh! I know I so wish
I could've gotten away for that.

770
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:01.000
Yeah. Yeah. me too. Mom.

771
00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.583
It's been a long time.

772
00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:05.041
Well. as a young
business owner yourself.

773
00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:07.041
you understand how crucial it is
to prioritize--

774
00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:09.125
Everything but family. yeah.

775
00:29:13.417 --> 00:29:14.583
Is it Hannah?

776
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:15.750
Yeah.

777
00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:16.875
-Would you mind--?
-Oh. yeah!

778
00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:18.041
I-I'll just go. uh...

779
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:20.208
I'm gonna measure
the aloe plants.

780
00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:27.583
Uh...

781
00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:29.792
I am here now. Taylor.

782
00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:34.417
And I really am
looking forward to spending time

783
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.917
with you and your brother.

784
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.375
We have so much to catch up on.

785
00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:41.333
Yeah. well. unfortunately.
I'm really quite busy.

786
00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:42.542
Um...

787
00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:43.875
I don't know.

788
00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:45.959
maybe if you'd called ahead...
or-or ever.

789
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.542
I-I sent birthday cards
and letters.

790
00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:51.750
{chuckles bitterly] Yeah.

791
00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:53.500
Yeah. Zach still hangs those
on the fridge.

792
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.500
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

793
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.083
Look. I'll-- I'll try and come
to your thing.

794
00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:02.834
Okay? I know how
really important it is to you.

795
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:04.834
Thank you.

796
00:30:06.083 --> 00:30:08.792
But I didn't
just come here for work.

797
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:12.959
Because we have a lot of things
that we need to discuss.

798
00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:14.083
[chuckles nervously]

799
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:16.041
Ahem. Important things.

800
00:30:16.125 --> 00:30:18.792
What? Did you decide
to sell the house? Evict Zach?

801
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:19.959
Yeah. Figured that was coming.

802
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:22.917
Taylor. No.

803
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.417
Your father trusted me
to do the right thing.

804
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.083
and I will always
take care of you and Zach.

805
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:30.208
[laughs bitterly]

806
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:33.000
Mom. you left.

807
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:35.709
As soon as he died.

808
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:38.959
We went from having
two loving parents to none.

809
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:41.667
in the space of a year.

810
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.583
That's not
something you can just fix

811
00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.166
with a pitstop
on your book tour.

812
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.125
[♪♪]

813
00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:48.709
Now. look. I'm sorry.

814
00:30:48.792 --> 00:30:51.750
but I really do
have to get back to work.

815
00:30:51.834 --> 00:30:53.583
which I'm sure
you understand.

816
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:55.917
[♪♪]

817
00:31:00.917 --> 00:31:01.917
[quietly] Yeah.

818
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.834
[♪♪]

819
00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:11.000
[bell jingles]

820
00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:15.000
[♪♪]

821
00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:19.291
Oh!

822
00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:20.583
Oh...

823
00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:23.041
Miss Bloom!

824
00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.500
Are you okay?

825
00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.500
No. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Ohh...

826
00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:35.834
[♪♪]

827
00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:37.041
I'm calling an ambulance.

828
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.250
No. no. no. don't do that.

829
00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:39.375
I'm fine.

830
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:40.834
I'm feeling much better already.

831
00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:42.417
Okay. great.

832
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.166
Then that gives me enough time
to drive you to the hospital.

833
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.750
I just over-exerted myself.
that's all.

834
00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:48.125
I'm going to finish
this glass of water.

835
00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:49.458
go back to my penthouse suite.

836
00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:50.625
order room service.

837
00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:52.375
and kick back
for the rest of the night.

838
00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:55.000
That sounds
extremely glamorous.

839
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:57.542
Unfortunately...

840
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:58.625
I can't let you leave.

841
00:31:58.709 --> 00:32:00.792
If this is a "Misery" situation.

842
00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:01.834
I want you to know.

843
00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:03.208
I do carry pepper spray
in my purse.

844
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:04.250
I'm not going to kidnap you

845
00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:05.500
and force you
to write me a book.

846
00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:06.625
Well. that's a relief.

847
00:32:06.709 --> 00:32:07.625
It's just...

848
00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:08.917
[sighs]

849
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.375
I know what those pills are.

850
00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:13.583
My grandpa took the same ones
before he...

851
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:17.417
The pills...

852
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.542
well. Margot...

853
00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:20.583
you got me there.

854
00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:24.041
The truth is

855
00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:25.709
that I am--

856
00:32:25.792 --> 00:32:27.917
well. I'm on a deadline
for my next book.

857
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.458
and I haven't written
a word in months.

858
00:32:29.542 --> 00:32:32.458
I just found out
that my daughter hates me.

859
00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:36.875
And I think
it's just a little unfair

860
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:40.458
that I am having
to work through all of that...

861
00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:43.083
while dealing
with a teeny-tiny hiccup

862
00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:46.333
of just recently having had
a heart attack.

863
00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:47.834
and that's
what the pills are for.

864
00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:49.417
Okay. are you having

865
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.083
a teeny-tiny...

866
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.417
heart attack right now?

867
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.333
I don't think so.

868
00:32:56.417 --> 00:32:57.333
[laughs nervously]

869
00:32:57.417 --> 00:32:58.250
You don't think so?

870
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.709
-[door closes]
-Mom?

871
00:33:03.792 --> 00:33:04.834
So you did know.

872
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:09.250
I was gonna text you.

873
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.709
She wanted to surprise you.

874
00:33:10.792 --> 00:33:12.375
Yeah. well. she did.

875
00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:14.500
She showed up
at The Bloomeria today

876
00:33:14.583 --> 00:33:16.250
and acted like
it hadn't been five years.

877
00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.792
And I take it
that it was a warm welcome?

878
00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:20.917
I think
she's really trying. Tay.

879
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.667
Do not "Tay" me.

880
00:33:23.917 --> 00:33:25.500
Were you two co-conspirators
on this?

881
00:33:25.583 --> 00:33:27.041
-Did you plan this whole thing?
-No!

882
00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:28.291
I didn't even know
she was coming.

883
00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:30.083
I just...

884
00:33:30.166 --> 00:33:32.792
I don't know.

885
00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:34.875
Maybe it's time to leave
the past in the past.

886
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.417
Cut her a break.

887
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.583
Yeah. of course.
she tracked you down first.

888
00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:41.792
All right.
what's that mean?

889
00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:43.625
You're just like Dad.

890
00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:45.583
[scoffs]

891
00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:46.959
Okay. first of all.

892
00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:49.333
she didn't track me down.

893
00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:51.208
-Okay. whatever you say.
-And furthermore.

894
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:52.750
what is wrong
with being like Dad?

895
00:33:52.834 --> 00:33:53.834
Come on. Zach.

896
00:33:53.917 --> 00:33:56.125
You let people
take advantage of you.

897
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:57.166
All the time.

898
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.709
-That's not true.
-Really?

899
00:33:58.792 --> 00:33:59.959
So you wanna tell me

900
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:01.417
how many drafts
you've done of these murals?

901
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.917
What. five? Six?

902
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.417
Sometimes.

903
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.792
you just have to cut your losses

904
00:34:06.875 --> 00:34:09.667
and stop holding on
to that tiny shred of hope

905
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.208
that people won't
continually disappoint you.

906
00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:16.333
I...

907
00:34:16.417 --> 00:34:18.083
I didn't come--

908
00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:21.959
I don't-- I don't
want to fight with you.

909
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:24.458
I'd rather you fight with me
than with Mom.

910
00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:26.792
I'm sorry.

911
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:28.250
I-I didn't mean--

912
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.417
I think you said
exactly what you meant to say.

913
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:33.333
Maybe you're right.

914
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:37.375
Maybe I am a pushover.
like Dad.

915
00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:40.041
But I would rather
be that than...

916
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.750
You know she's only here
for her book signing. right?

917
00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:48.583
She didn't come to apologize.

918
00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:50.208
It's not about us.

919
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:54.625
-I should get back to this.
-Sure.

920
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.959
Zach.

921
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:13.000
She had five years
to fix all of this.

922
00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:17.792
It's too late.

923
00:35:17.875 --> 00:35:22.083
So. I will tolerate
Mom's presence in Pennfield

924
00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:23.375
because I love you.

925
00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:25.917
But no matter what
you want to believe.

926
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.709
I know
that Mom'll be out of here

927
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:30.458
as soon as she gets her fill
of her hero worship.

928
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:35.208
[footsteps recede]

929
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:37.542
[♪♪]

930
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.500
[Max] I'm listening.

931
00:35:39.583 --> 00:35:40.625
Okay. so. she's never
dated a woman before.

932
00:35:40.709 --> 00:35:41.709
So she's straight.

933
00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:43.125
Aren't we evolved enough

934
00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:45.792
to admit that human sexuality
exists on a spectrum?

935
00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:47.834
Okay. so she's bi?

936
00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:51.875
[stammers] No. I don't
want to assign labels

937
00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:52.959
or make any assumptions. okay?

938
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:54.333
She said

939
00:35:54.417 --> 00:35:56.750
she's never met a woman
who interests her before.

940
00:35:56.834 --> 00:35:58.667
And sometimes.

941
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.792
you just don't know
until you know. You know?

942
00:36:01.917 --> 00:36:05.166
So again. I ask.
what's the problem?

943
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.166
I just--I don't want
to fall for her if we're--

944
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.959
if we're destined to end up
as platonic friends.

945
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:12.834
Okay.

946
00:36:12.917 --> 00:36:16.000
There was this...
thing between us.

947
00:36:16.083 --> 00:36:17.834
[chuckles]

948
00:36:17.917 --> 00:36:19.792
You really liked her. huh?

949
00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:21.333
Yeah. of course. I did.

950
00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:22.875
which inevitably means

951
00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:24.500
I'm never gonna
hear from her again.

952
00:36:24.583 --> 00:36:26.458
-Pfft. Come on.
-[phone chimes]

953
00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:28.834
Look. that's probably her.
Go on. Check it.

954
00:36:28.917 --> 00:36:31.291
[message alert chimes]

955
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:32.750
Go on.

956
00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:35.291
Check it.

957
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.250
"Need to blow off some steam.

958
00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.917
Are you up for an adventure
outside of the coffee shop?"

959
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.834
Ooh...

960
00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:47.125
She's asking me out
on a date. right?

961
00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:49.709
Yeah. "An adventure."

962
00:36:49.792 --> 00:36:52.959
That could mean anything.
Is it a date or-or not a date?

963
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:55.000
Oh! Oh. so now you understand
the value of labels?

964
00:36:55.083 --> 00:36:56.792
I got it. Yeah.

965
00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:59.041
-Not helping!
-Ow. ow. ow. Okay. okay.

966
00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.583
So...

967
00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:03.125
just ask her
for some clarification.

968
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:07.500
But. like...
in a flirty way.

969
00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:10.000
"Flirty" clarification?

970
00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:10.959
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

971
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:13.834
Okay. Yes.

972
00:37:13.917 --> 00:37:15.125
Um...

973
00:37:15.208 --> 00:37:16.291
[sucks air]

974
00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:17.333
I-I don't know
how to do that.

975
00:37:17.417 --> 00:37:18.375
What?

976
00:37:21.166 --> 00:37:23.500
[Hannah]
What's good? Whatcha doing?

977
00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:26.250
Super-cas.

978
00:37:26.333 --> 00:37:28.583
Now I'm actually interested.

979
00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:32.500
I may have gone on a date...
through that app.

980
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.166
You used Classifie?

981
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.375
Boss!

982
00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:37.250
I'm so proud!

983
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:38.333
What?

984
00:37:38.417 --> 00:37:39.709
Did you totally blow it?

985
00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:41.834
No.

986
00:37:41.917 --> 00:37:42.917
At least...
I don't think I did.

987
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.834
It was supposed to be
a quick coffee

988
00:37:44.917 --> 00:37:46.834
and we talked for three hours.

989
00:37:46.917 --> 00:37:47.917
Hah.

990
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.375
I knew something was up.

991
00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:51.208
You never let me open solo.

992
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:53.959
Then I asked if they wanted
to go on another date.

993
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:56.500
and it's been
three blinking dots.

994
00:37:56.583 --> 00:37:57.583
Ouch.

995
00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:00.291
Wait. So that is bad?

996
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.542
Well. not necessarily.

997
00:38:01.625 --> 00:38:03.208
but it's probably
more complicated

998
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:04.667
than you thought.

999
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.208
Like. I don't know.

1000
00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:07.959
maybe he's seeing
multiple people.

1001
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:09.792
and he really likes you.

1002
00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:12.333
but he just doesn't want
to lead you on.

1003
00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:14.291
in case he really likes
someone else more.

1004
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.166
Or he's married.
That's always a possibility.

1005
00:38:17.834 --> 00:38:20.166
I don't think so.

1006
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.250
You don't know.
People lie.

1007
00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.000
Well. he's not married.

1008
00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:27.250
and he's not dating a lot...

1009
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:28.792
What am I even saying?

1010
00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:30.083
Uh...

1011
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:31.583
he...

1012
00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:34.375
isn't a he.

1013
00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:36.166
[stunned gasp]

1014
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:41.083
What is this for?

1015
00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:42.458
First of all.

1016
00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:43.542
I'm super proud of you

1017
00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:45.417
for embracing
this new possibility.

1018
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.375
And second.

1019
00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:51.250
getting ghosted by a woman
has got to be so much harder.

1020
00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:52.250
Wow.

1021
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.458
I'm not getting ghosted.

1022
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.333
Am I?

1023
00:38:57.417 --> 00:38:59.834
[♪♪]

1024
00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:03.125
Hannah!

1025
00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:05.250
Okay. I'm just gonna say.
"Would love to see you again.

1026
00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:06.750
Is this a date-date
or not a date?"

1027
00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:07.792
Right?

1028
00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:09.417
Do-- Do-Do not send that.

1029
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.709
-No?
-No!

1030
00:39:10.792 --> 00:39:12.709
Just give me the phone.
I'll handle this.

1031
00:39:12.792 --> 00:39:14.375
-Oh. okay.
-Yeah. I got this.

1032
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:15.583
-[phone rings]
-Oh! No. I gotta get that.

1033
00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:19.041
This is Dr. Murray speaking.

1034
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.291
I'll be right there.

1035
00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:25.291
Bye.

1036
00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:30.250
Go. Go. I got this.

1037
00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:37.917
I know things might
seem dark right now.

1038
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.458
but I-I promise. in time.

1039
00:39:40.542 --> 00:39:42.959
you'll find other women.

1040
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:44.917
Or men. Or whatever.

1041
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.458
You made real strides today.

1042
00:39:49.959 --> 00:39:51.125
You're not gonna pass out.
are you?

1043
00:39:51.208 --> 00:39:52.291
I'm not trying
to make this about me.

1044
00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:53.166
Okay.

1045
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.417
-[knocks]
-What is it?

1046
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.000
Is she having a heart attack?
Is she dying?

1047
00:39:56.083 --> 00:39:58.208
Just. um.
you can ignore Margot.

1048
00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:00.458
Okay. Is this your daughter?

1049
00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:03.291
No. no. She's actually
my bookseller.

1050
00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:04.417
[laughs]

1051
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.667
Oh! Which reminds me.

1052
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.542
uh. you should really
come to my book reading.

1053
00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:10.917
[laughs]

1054
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.166
Yes. um... yes. okay.

1055
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.917
-Emilia.
-Hmm?

1056
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.458
When you transferred
into my care.

1057
00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:19.041
you promised me
that you were gonna--

1058
00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.083
you were gonna stop drinking.

1059
00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.542
you were gonna
monitor your diet.

1060
00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:23.875
and you were gonna take
your medication religiously.

1061
00:40:23.959 --> 00:40:25.000
And you assured me
that you had

1062
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.625
the necessary support systems
in place

1063
00:40:26.709 --> 00:40:27.667
to help you do that here.

1064
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.166
Well. I have. um...

1065
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.208
I have Margot!

1066
00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:34.667
She is very...

1067
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.375
supportive.

1068
00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:37.875
And I have you!

1069
00:40:37.959 --> 00:40:39.625
I'm your doctor.

1070
00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:41.125
Yes! Yes.

1071
00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:42.667
Emilia.

1072
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.291
I thought the whole point of
receiving treatment in Pennfield

1073
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.750
was so that you could be
closer to your family.

1074
00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:46.917
for their support.

1075
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:47.917
Why aren't they here?

1076
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.041
Yeah.

1077
00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:54.792
Well. I am. um.
I am working on that.

1078
00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:57.083
Well. your chart indicates
that you're not.

1079
00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.959
And I'm concerned that you could
have another cardiac event.

1080
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.583
Okay. I will do better.

1081
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:04.375
I-I-I will do better. better.
better. better. I promise.

1082
00:41:04.458 --> 00:41:06.083
Well. I'm telling you.
at this point.

1083
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:07.792
you have no other option.

1084
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:16.709
A mimosa while you wait.
Ms. Bloom?

1085
00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:18.458
Oh! Yes. please.

1086
00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:20.792
Actually...

1087
00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:23.250
sorry. could you just give me
the juice part?

1088
00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:25.417
And...

1089
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.333
an herbal tea?

1090
00:41:27.417 --> 00:41:29.250
[server] No problem.

1091
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:38.208
-Hi.
-Hi!

1092
00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:41.709
Uh... are you being followed?

1093
00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:43.333
Am I?

1094
00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:45.750
Zach. it's a joke.
Sit down!

1095
00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:47.917
Sorry. It's just...

1096
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.709
just feels strange.
not inviting Taylor.

1097
00:41:50.792 --> 00:41:52.834
I doubt you're gonna
get spotted here.

1098
00:41:52.917 --> 00:41:56.500
because. apparently. she never
steps foot outside of her shop.

1099
00:41:56.583 --> 00:41:58.041
We still do family dinner.

1100
00:41:58.125 --> 00:41:59.542
-Every week.
-You do?

1101
00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:02.417
I think you two have been
good for each other.

1102
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.792
We didn't really have
a choice. so.

1103
00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:06.500
[server] Your juice...

1104
00:42:06.583 --> 00:42:07.625
and the tea.

1105
00:42:07.709 --> 00:42:09.542
Oh. no. sorry.
she only drinks coffee.

1106
00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:11.542
Buckets and buckets of coffee.

1107
00:42:11.625 --> 00:42:13.542
No. no. no.
Zach. it's totally fine.

1108
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:14.917
[chuckles]

1109
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.083
So herbal-y.

1110
00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.125
Thank you.

1111
00:42:17.208 --> 00:42:19.917
[sighing] Ahh...

1112
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.125
Are you okay?

1113
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:25.208
Yeah! No. I'm... so happy

1114
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:27.583
that you were free to come
and join me for breakfast.

1115
00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:29.625
Conveniently.
I have no life. so.

1116
00:42:29.709 --> 00:42:30.750
You have your work.

1117
00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:32.208
-Is that not going well?
-I'm designing

1118
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:33.625
a mural
for Between Two Covers.

1119
00:42:33.709 --> 00:42:35.333
You know. the bookstore?

1120
00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:38.125
It nearly folded. like.
a couple years ago. I think.

1121
00:42:38.208 --> 00:42:39.667
Yeah. seems that
they're having a comeback

1122
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.125
if they're commissioning murals

1123
00:42:41.208 --> 00:42:43.875
and. you know.
hosting my book reading.

1124
00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:45.625
Well. at least one of those
will be a success.

1125
00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:46.917
Ohh.

1126
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.792
I'm just a little bit stuck
creatively.

1127
00:42:49.875 --> 00:42:51.542
Does that ever happen to you?

1128
00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:52.709
What am I thinking?

1129
00:42:52.792 --> 00:42:54.583
A book a year--
you're a machine.

1130
00:42:54.667 --> 00:42:56.959
That is not always
a good thing. Zach.

1131
00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.709
Your sister--

1132
00:42:58.792 --> 00:43:01.709
I mean. she's more like me
than-than she'll ever admit.

1133
00:43:01.792 --> 00:43:04.458
You know. she's stubborn
and driven and single-minded.

1134
00:43:04.542 --> 00:43:06.417
and. you know. it's why
she's gonna make that shop

1135
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.667
a wild success.

1136
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.417
but I just hope
that she doesn't neglect

1137
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.417
the rest of her life

1138
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.208
to see it succeed.

1139
00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:15.125
Hmm.

1140
00:43:15.208 --> 00:43:19.000
I was thinking maybe you could.
you know. talk to her.

1141
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:21.500
It's not like
I have all the answers.

1142
00:43:21.583 --> 00:43:24.291
My personal life's probably
going worse than the mural.

1143
00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:26.542
Recent highlights include
an accidental date with my mom.

1144
00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:28.333
[Emilia laughs]

1145
00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:30.000
Maybe you're just
an analog guy.

1146
00:43:30.083 --> 00:43:31.166
like your dad.

1147
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.417
He was always
so old-fashioned that way.

1148
00:43:34.834 --> 00:43:36.625
I was thinking about
our bowling nights recently.

1149
00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:37.959
I have to confess.

1150
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:39.709
I always felt
a tiny bit left out.

1151
00:43:39.792 --> 00:43:41.333
Your dad.

1152
00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:45.125
he always understood
the need to live and play.

1153
00:43:45.208 --> 00:43:48.417
I kind of struggled
with the balance of that.

1154
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.792
Hmm.

1155
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.417
I know that you still miss him

1156
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.041
and I want you to know
that I miss him

1157
00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:00.000
still.

1158
00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:03.750
Desperately.

1159
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:10.000
And I know I haven't been
a very present parent.

1160
00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:13.333
But I'm here now.

1161
00:44:15.917 --> 00:44:17.333
Let me try.

1162
00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:21.291
I gotta ask. [laughs]

1163
00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:22.709
What's with the tea?

1164
00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:24.542
Well--

1165
00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:27.083
that is just a...
it's a healthier alternative.

1166
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:31.166
so. yeah. and I've-I've also
stopped drinking.

1167
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.417
-What?
-[laughs] Yeah.

1168
00:44:34.542 --> 00:44:35.834
Hannah. do you know where

1169
00:44:35.917 --> 00:44:37.625
the rest of the healing
amethyst crystals are?

1170
00:44:37.709 --> 00:44:41.250
I thought we placed our order.
but I can't seem to find any.

1171
00:44:41.333 --> 00:44:42.875
Uh. have you checked

1172
00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:45.333
wherever you keep
your very tiny fairy lights?

1173
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.291
You laugh.

1174
00:44:48.375 --> 00:44:50.750
but I do stock
very tiny fairy lights.

1175
00:44:50.834 --> 00:44:53.333
Oh. I would be disappointed
if you didn't.

1176
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.709
That is...

1177
00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:58.333
quite the glass thing.

1178
00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:00.250
Uh. special-order terrarium.

1179
00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:01.625
-Ah.
-Hi.

1180
00:45:01.709 --> 00:45:03.667
Hi.

1181
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.583
-You--
-I...

1182
00:45:04.667 --> 00:45:05.750
Ah. Thank you.

1183
00:45:05.834 --> 00:45:07.834
Um...

1184
00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:10.375
you found my shop.

1185
00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:12.375
I did. Did you know
that there are very few

1186
00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:14.041
artisanal pottery
and plant shops

1187
00:45:14.125 --> 00:45:15.333
within walking distance
to Joe's?

1188
00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:16.959
Right. right.

1189
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.208
Um...

1190
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.375
so you aren't ghosting me...

1191
00:45:21.458 --> 00:45:22.750
Did you expect me to?

1192
00:45:22.834 --> 00:45:24.166
N-No. No.

1193
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.959
I. uh...

1194
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:28.125
you know
the three-dots-of-death thing?

1195
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:30.417
Um. my employee--

1196
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.125
...told me to abandon all hope.

1197
00:45:34.208 --> 00:45:36.417
Oh. no. I-- I'm so sorry
I left you hanging.

1198
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.208
I got called into work
last night.

1199
00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:41.041
Oh. I mean. yeah.
I totally get it.

1200
00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:44.041
I get called into work
all the time for emergencies.

1201
00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:46.166
You know.
over-watering emergencies

1202
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.375
and-and under-watering.

1203
00:45:48.458 --> 00:45:51.083
[chuckles]
I know you're joking. but...

1204
00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:52.458
don't downplay what you do.

1205
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:53.750
You've managed to keep

1206
00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:55.709
a small business open
in a terrible economy.

1207
00:45:55.792 --> 00:45:57.875
That's really impressive.

1208
00:45:57.959 --> 00:45:59.083
I tell her that
all the time.

1209
00:46:00.208 --> 00:46:01.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

1210
00:46:01.583 --> 00:46:02.834
Sorry. I'm-- I'm Hannah.

1211
00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:03.959
Oh. yes.

1212
00:46:04.041 --> 00:46:05.000
Uh. Franki.

1213
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:07.125
Nice to meet you.

1214
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:09.792
You know. we should. uh.
find a place to talk.

1215
00:46:09.875 --> 00:46:12.542
but. um. maybe not here.

1216
00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:16.375
Yes. Um...

1217
00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:18.709
can I can steal you tonight?

1218
00:46:18.792 --> 00:46:20.083
I'm not on call.

1219
00:46:20.166 --> 00:46:21.709
I love this.

1220
00:46:21.792 --> 00:46:23.667
This is... really good.

1221
00:46:24.875 --> 00:46:27.000
-Uh. Hannah...
-[Franki laughs]

1222
00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:30.166
...could you maybe go look
for that box of crystals?

1223
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.917
[♪♪]

1224
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:36.333
[chuckles]

1225
00:46:36.417 --> 00:46:38.083
I. uh. I close up at seven.

1226
00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:39.542
7:00.

1227
00:46:39.625 --> 00:46:41.208
Um. okay. could you sneak away.
like. an hour early?

1228
00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:43.041
I really
want to show you this...

1229
00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:44.208
this thing.

1230
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:45.166
but it's kind of time-sensitive.

1231
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.709
Um. that's just
a little tough--

1232
00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:49.709
[Hannah shouts]
I can close tonight!

1233
00:46:49.792 --> 00:46:51.125
In case anybody was wondering.

1234
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.208
I will make it work.
apparently.

1235
00:46:53.291 --> 00:46:54.750
[laughs] Yeah.

1236
00:46:54.834 --> 00:46:55.959
Great.

1237
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:58.166
Okay. I will...
I'll see you then.

1238
00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:00.667
-Bye.
-Bye.

1239
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.667
Good call. Boss.

1240
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:06.792
She's hot.

1241
00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:07.709
Hot doctor.

1242
00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.125
Stop.

1243
00:47:09.208 --> 00:47:11.625
9-1-1. I've got a fever.

1244
00:47:11.709 --> 00:47:14.250
and her name is Dr. Franki.

1245
00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:16.417
You know what
a second date means. right?

1246
00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:21.000
We should probably
have a talk.

1247
00:47:21.083 --> 00:47:23.375
[♪♪]

1248
00:47:23.458 --> 00:47:25.709
[groans] Oh. Madeleine.
Madeleine. Madeleine.

1249
00:47:25.792 --> 00:47:30.083
I am gonna need
your stiffest Shirley Temple.

1250
00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:32.125
You're sure I can't tempt you
with a glass of wine?

1251
00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:33.792
It's nearly happy hour.

1252
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:35.458
[inhales]

1253
00:47:35.542 --> 00:47:37.166
No. thank you.

1254
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.083
This book
isn't gonna write itself.

1255
00:47:41.417 --> 00:47:43.834
Excuse me. Miss.
is this seat taken?

1256
00:47:43.917 --> 00:47:45.750
Depends who's asking.

1257
00:47:47.834 --> 00:47:49.375
Your biggest admirer.

1258
00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:52.792
Brian Thompson?

1259
00:47:52.875 --> 00:47:53.792
Yup.

1260
00:47:53.875 --> 00:47:54.917
-Is that you?
-Yup.

1261
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.917
What?

1262
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.583
Oh. my gosh. hello!

1263
00:47:58.667 --> 00:47:59.959
-Oh.
-[laughing happily]

1264
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.375
Welcome home. Em.

1265
00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:05.041
Thank you.

1266
00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:06.667
[♪♪]

1267
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.041
So. this is why you asked me
to leave the clogs at the shop?

1268
00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:10.458
Well. it's not
a super challenging hike.

1269
00:48:10.542 --> 00:48:12.458
Just enough
to get the blood flowing.

1270
00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:13.667
Okay. just
for your information.

1271
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.417
I'm not super outdoorsy.

1272
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.500
Most kids. they go camping.

1273
00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:19.542
I went bowling with my dad.

1274
00:48:20.792 --> 00:48:21.625
Are you in?

1275
00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:27.458
I can't believe
you have my very first.

1276
00:48:27.542 --> 00:48:29.375
I mean. and this is
in absolutely perfect.

1277
00:48:29.458 --> 00:48:30.291
perfect condition.

1278
00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:31.875
You've obviously not read it.

1279
00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:33.417
Of course.
I read your book. Em.

1280
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.417
Really?

1281
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.542
Yeah. I read all your books.

1282
00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:37.291
I saved this one
for an inscription.

1283
00:48:37.375 --> 00:48:38.291
if you would do me the honor.

1284
00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:39.458
Of course.

1285
00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:42.917
but first.
you owe me an explanation.

1286
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.792
Huh. What do you mean?

1287
00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:45.750
How did you know
I was staying here?

1288
00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:46.709
[chuckles]

1289
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.208
Between Two Covers.

1290
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:51.041
Is Margot going around.
telling people my business?

1291
00:48:51.125 --> 00:48:52.208
No.

1292
00:48:52.291 --> 00:48:53.458
She did. however.

1293
00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:55.333
tell her employer
where to find you.

1294
00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:56.375
You own the bookstore?

1295
00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:57.792
-Mm-hmm. yeah.
-What?

1296
00:48:57.875 --> 00:49:00.959
You're kinda
responsible for that.

1297
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:02.875
I used to read
those short stories you wrote.

1298
00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:05.000
Oh. Oh... those were bad.

1299
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:06.709
They were fantastic.

1300
00:49:06.792 --> 00:49:08.333
and they got me hooked.

1301
00:49:08.417 --> 00:49:10.625
I started spending
way too much time reading

1302
00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:13.333
while gradually growing
to resent my actual job.

1303
00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:14.375
Which was?

1304
00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:16.041
Accountant.

1305
00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:17.458
[laughs]

1306
00:49:17.542 --> 00:49:18.333
[ruefully] I know.

1307
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:20.250
Sorry.

1308
00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:23.083
But I'm really good
at balancing the books now.

1309
00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:25.500
So. what made you decide
to buy the bookstore?

1310
00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:28.041
Some people go through
a mid-life crisis.

1311
00:49:28.125 --> 00:49:29.750
After my divorce.

1312
00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:31.792
Between Two Covers was mine.

1313
00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:33.417
Ah...

1314
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.750
No.

1315
00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:37.333
No infidelity. no kids.
nothing like that.

1316
00:49:37.417 --> 00:49:39.083
Nothing for your next book.

1317
00:49:39.166 --> 00:49:40.125
[laughs]

1318
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.083
I just came to realize

1319
00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.583
that I was more excited

1320
00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:45.709
about the prospect
of saving a community treasure

1321
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:47.166
than I was...

1322
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.583
saving my own marriage.

1323
00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:50.208
and. ironically.

1324
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:52.208
for once. my ex
was on the same page.

1325
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.458
I have to confess.

1326
00:49:56.542 --> 00:50:00.291
I wasn't sure that Pennfield
would ever get you back

1327
00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:01.542
after your husband passed.

1328
00:50:01.625 --> 00:50:02.750
Ms. Bloom.

1329
00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:04.542
Ah. thank you.

1330
00:50:04.625 --> 00:50:05.917
What are you drinking?

1331
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.333
Oh. this is a Shirley Temple.

1332
00:50:07.417 --> 00:50:08.250
A Shirley Temple?

1333
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:09.291
Yeah.

1334
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:10.583
[chuckles mirthlessly]

1335
00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:11.959
Well. I'm working.
and I'm... you know...

1336
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:13.458
[sighs]

1337
00:50:13.542 --> 00:50:16.000
I'm trying a whole new...

1338
00:50:16.083 --> 00:50:17.041
diet.

1339
00:50:17.125 --> 00:50:18.291
Why?

1340
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:19.542
You're-you're stunning.

1341
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:20.375
You're as stunning
as you ever were.

1342
00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:21.583
Oh.

1343
00:50:21.667 --> 00:50:22.792
well. thank you.

1344
00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:24.291
Um... [chuckling] but no.

1345
00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:26.959
It's just. um... yeah.

1346
00:50:27.041 --> 00:50:28.542
It's not a vanity thing.

1347
00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:29.625
Just...

1348
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.709
Is it a health thing?

1349
00:50:38.834 --> 00:50:40.250
Wow.

1350
00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:41.709
Not too bad. right?

1351
00:50:41.792 --> 00:50:43.750
I mean...

1352
00:50:43.834 --> 00:50:45.333
Please tell me
I don't have to start hiking

1353
00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:47.041
on the regular.

1354
00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:48.291
Sometimes.
it's worth the effort.

1355
00:50:48.375 --> 00:50:49.417
[chuckles]

1356
00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.542
[sighs] I gotta be honest.

1357
00:50:55.625 --> 00:50:58.208
I really don't know
what I'm doing.

1358
00:50:58.291 --> 00:50:59.625
Yeah. well.

1359
00:50:59.709 --> 00:51:02.333
it's just one foot
in front of the other. really.

1360
00:51:02.417 --> 00:51:05.291
I am not talking
about the hiking.

1361
00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:06.667
Yeah. I know.

1362
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:10.959
Franki.

1363
00:51:11.041 --> 00:51:13.000
you are amazing.

1364
00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:14.667
in every way...

1365
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.333
But?

1366
00:51:16.417 --> 00:51:17.792
No-- [sighs]

1367
00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:25.208
[text message buzzes]

1368
00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:45.041
I wouldn't be so worried

1369
00:51:45.125 --> 00:51:46.125
if I wasn't convinced

1370
00:51:46.208 --> 00:51:48.041
I was gonna somehow
screw this up.

1371
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.792
Well.

1372
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.333
if that's your main concern...

1373
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.125
I can promise you

1374
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:59.083
that we all screw it up
at some point.

1375
00:51:59.166 --> 00:52:00.500
Well. that's comforting.

1376
00:52:00.583 --> 00:52:02.750
[chuckling]
Just being honest.

1377
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.834
That doesn't scare me.

1378
00:52:11.041 --> 00:52:13.625
That makes one of us.

1379
00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:22.166
[♪♪]

1380
00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:42.166
[Hannah] Hey. Zach.
Long time no see.

1381
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.792
Hey.

1382
00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:48.583
Is Taylor in the back?

1383
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:52.417
No.

1384
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.750
No...

1385
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.667
Is she doing a delivery
or something?

1386
00:52:57.875 --> 00:52:59.083
Don't think so.

1387
00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:01.250
Huh.

1388
00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:04.834
She's not answering my texts.

1389
00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:06.208
Nobody's answering my texts.

1390
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.959
I guess Taylor's pretty busy.

1391
00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:11.041
But not with work.

1392
00:53:11.125 --> 00:53:13.250
See. that's very unlike Taylor.

1393
00:53:16.333 --> 00:53:17.625
What's going on. Hannah?

1394
00:53:17.709 --> 00:53:20.125
I know you know.

1395
00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:21.667
How's your. uh...

1396
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:23.208
mural going. Zach?

1397
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:24.458
You know about that?

1398
00:53:24.542 --> 00:53:26.250
I got my sources.

1399
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.208
Ears in the street.

1400
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:29.083
It's...

1401
00:53:29.166 --> 00:53:30.375
it's going good.

1402
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:32.166
it's going really well.
great. mm-hmm.

1403
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.083
-Hmm.
-Top-notch.

1404
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:37.583
Okay. well. just tell Taylor
I came by. all right?

1405
00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:39.375
I'm making dinner this week.

1406
00:53:39.458 --> 00:53:40.917
Whatever she wants.

1407
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.834
But that would actually require
her to answer my messages.

1408
00:53:44.792 --> 00:53:46.083
That app is a plague.

1409
00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:48.959
It only works if you work it.

1410
00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:50.417
Yeah. yeah.

1411
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:56.083
Hmm.

1412
00:53:58.792 --> 00:54:00.625
I cannot believe
how long it's been.

1413
00:54:00.709 --> 00:54:03.542
I really didn't mean
to stay away as long as I did.

1414
00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:05.750
It's just once I was gone.

1415
00:54:05.834 --> 00:54:07.583
it was easier not to feel
his crushing absence

1416
00:54:07.667 --> 00:54:09.458
every single second
of every single day.

1417
00:54:09.542 --> 00:54:12.834
We built a life here together.

1418
00:54:12.917 --> 00:54:15.959
We built a home.

1419
00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:20.000
We shared our first kiss
right across the street.

1420
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.375
I can see
how that would be difficult.

1421
00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:25.750
Impossible...

1422
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.792
...and the kids
don't understand.

1423
00:54:30.875 --> 00:54:33.625
I did not leave to hurt them.

1424
00:54:33.709 --> 00:54:36.000
I left so that
they wouldn't have to live

1425
00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:37.375
with all of my pain.

1426
00:54:37.458 --> 00:54:39.125
They had enough of their own
to deal with.

1427
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:41.458
And did you explain it
to them like that?

1428
00:54:41.542 --> 00:54:44.834
Well. I mean.
Taylor wouldn't let me. and...

1429
00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:46.166
Besides.

1430
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.125
I'm just really not good
at these conversations.

1431
00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:53.792
Andy was always the one
that comforted them.

1432
00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:58.000
You've just got to find a way
to talk to Taylor.

1433
00:54:58.083 --> 00:55:00.792
If she's anything like you.
she'll understand.

1434
00:55:00.875 --> 00:55:03.458
Once you get past
the bristly. angry part.

1435
00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:05.709
Good luck to me.
[chuckles ruefully]

1436
00:55:05.792 --> 00:55:07.041
Right.

1437
00:55:07.125 --> 00:55:08.083
I'm sorry.

1438
00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:09.500
You know what.

1439
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:11.458
I really didn't mean
to unload all of this on you.

1440
00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:12.583
I should've just
signed your book

1441
00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:13.583
and let you--

1442
00:55:13.667 --> 00:55:15.166
let you go on your way.

1443
00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:22.458
I don't feel that way.

1444
00:55:24.917 --> 00:55:25.959
I think we both know

1445
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:28.500
that I've always
had a thing for you.

1446
00:55:28.583 --> 00:55:29.792
Really?

1447
00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:32.375
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

1448
00:55:32.458 --> 00:55:33.709
It just.

1449
00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:35.917
if felt wrong bringing it up
with your husband.

1450
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.291
Oh. please. he knew. too.

1451
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:39.250
Why do you think
he proposed so quickly?

1452
00:55:39.333 --> 00:55:40.667
I knew it.

1453
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.125
See? You snooze.
you lose. buddy.

1454
00:55:42.208 --> 00:55:44.333
That's the way it goes.

1455
00:55:44.417 --> 00:55:45.959
It's nice to think

1456
00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:47.834
that we still have time
to make new choices.

1457
00:55:49.917 --> 00:55:51.875
You know. me.
with the bookstore.

1458
00:55:51.959 --> 00:55:54.333
You with your kids.

1459
00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.583
Well. I certainly know

1460
00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:57.709
that it's on me
to make things right.

1461
00:55:57.792 --> 00:55:58.834
After my heart attack.

1462
00:55:58.917 --> 00:56:00.208
I realized.

1463
00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:01.166
"Oh. maybe I don't have
all the time in the world

1464
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.333
to find my way back there.

1465
00:56:03.417 --> 00:56:05.500
and then my kids
will never know...

1466
00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:07.583
[chuckles ruefully]
...why I left."

1467
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:10.500
[sighing] Oh. god...

1468
00:56:12.375 --> 00:56:14.667
Hey... you okay?

1469
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.208
No. no. no. it's not that.

1470
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:17.709
I--

1471
00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:18.959
let me take you back
to the hotel.

1472
00:56:19.041 --> 00:56:20.375
You know what.

1473
00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:21.792
if you don't mind.

1474
00:56:21.875 --> 00:56:23.792
I think I have a better idea.

1475
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.542
[Zach] Taylor. Is that you?

1476
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:31.333
Hi. honey!

1477
00:56:31.417 --> 00:56:32.458
Mom!

1478
00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:33.625
All right.

1479
00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:34.709
call me if you need anything.

1480
00:56:34.792 --> 00:56:35.917
Thank you so much.

1481
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Thank you.

1482
00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:37.875
[sighs]

1483
00:56:39.417 --> 00:56:40.750
I'm home!

1484
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:44.875
So. you're moving in?

1485
00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:47.625
Uh... you offered. didn't you?

1486
00:56:47.709 --> 00:56:49.291
Yeah. and you turned me down.

1487
00:56:49.375 --> 00:56:51.500
I thought you were leaving town
right after your reading.

1488
00:56:51.583 --> 00:56:52.500
I never said that.

1489
00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:55.041
No. I think that. um...

1490
00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:56.709
I think there are
some reasons

1491
00:56:56.792 --> 00:56:58.083
that I should
stick around for a while.

1492
00:56:58.166 --> 00:56:59.583
It's not because of
that guy. right?

1493
00:56:59.667 --> 00:57:00.834
I mean.
where'd you even meet him?

1494
00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:01.875
Technically?

1495
00:57:01.959 --> 00:57:02.875
The hotel bar.

1496
00:57:02.959 --> 00:57:03.875
Mom!

1497
00:57:03.959 --> 00:57:05.417
You've got to be careful.

1498
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.875
He could be trying to scam you?

1499
00:57:06.959 --> 00:57:07.709
I mean. you're kind of
a high-profile person

1500
00:57:07.792 --> 00:57:08.750
around here.

1501
00:57:08.834 --> 00:57:10.291
Oh. just around here?

1502
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:12.625
I was looking for
international notoriety.

1503
00:57:12.709 --> 00:57:13.834
You know what I mean.

1504
00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:15.250
He's not trying
to scam me. Zach.

1505
00:57:15.333 --> 00:57:16.500
He's an old friend.

1506
00:57:17.792 --> 00:57:19.333
I know.

1507
00:57:19.417 --> 00:57:20.792
it's weird to think that
I had a life before kids.

1508
00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:22.333
but I did.

1509
00:57:22.417 --> 00:57:24.417
-[chuckling] Mom...
-Zach. Zach. Zach. Zach. Zach.

1510
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.667
I did not come here
to talk about Brian. okay?

1511
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.083
[exhales nervously]

1512
00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:37.083
I should have told you this
right from the start.

1513
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:39.709
I didn't come to Pennfield
for a stop on my book tour.

1514
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:43.000
I asked my publisher

1515
00:57:43.083 --> 00:57:44.417
to find a reason
to send me here

1516
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.083
because I needed
to see you and your sister.

1517
00:57:47.166 --> 00:57:48.834
What's going on?

1518
00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:51.375
I had a heart attack.

1519
00:57:51.458 --> 00:57:52.750
A heart attack?

1520
00:57:52.834 --> 00:57:53.709
A few months ago.

1521
00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:54.583
Mom.

1522
00:57:54.667 --> 00:57:56.250
But don't worry.

1523
00:57:56.333 --> 00:57:58.875
I am being treated.
by an excellent specialist.

1524
00:57:58.959 --> 00:58:01.917
It's just that the whole
recovery thing

1525
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.500
apparently is...

1526
00:58:04.583 --> 00:58:07.583
could take longer
than I expected. and...

1527
00:58:07.667 --> 00:58:08.667
[scoffs]

1528
00:58:10.375 --> 00:58:11.500
[scoffing]

1529
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:12.625
I can't believe
you had a heart attack

1530
00:58:12.709 --> 00:58:14.291
and didn't tell us.

1531
00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:15.542
Now you're mad?

1532
00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:16.709
No. I'm not mad.

1533
00:58:16.792 --> 00:58:18.125
I'm furious.

1534
00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:19.750
I wanted to tell you earlier.

1535
00:58:19.834 --> 00:58:20.834
but your sister--

1536
00:58:20.917 --> 00:58:22.208
No. no. don't blame her!

1537
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:24.208
I know she gives you
a hard time.

1538
00:58:24.291 --> 00:58:26.333
but that was your choice.

1539
00:58:26.417 --> 00:58:27.750
We've always been living

1540
00:58:27.834 --> 00:58:30.792
with the repercussions
of your choices.

1541
00:58:30.875 --> 00:58:31.834
I mean. you think
you're protecting us.

1542
00:58:31.917 --> 00:58:33.166
but by keeping
a distance from us.

1543
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.625
you're just
driving the wedge deeper.

1544
00:58:36.667 --> 00:58:37.834
I'm sorry. Zach.

1545
00:58:42.625 --> 00:58:43.959
Clearly. this was a bad idea.

1546
00:58:44.041 --> 00:58:45.000
Clearly.

1547
00:58:45.083 --> 00:58:46.417
I mean. it was a bad idea.

1548
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.417
and I knew it was a bad idea.
and I should just--

1549
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.625
Right. well.
there you go again.

1550
00:58:48.709 --> 00:58:49.750
walking away.
just like Taylor would say.

1551
00:58:49.834 --> 00:58:51.333
Put your bags down. Mom.

1552
00:58:53.375 --> 00:58:55.291
Right. this isn't a debate.

1553
00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:06.959
[♪♪]

1554
00:59:07.041 --> 00:59:08.917
Zach. you are
such a gifted artist.

1555
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.959
Then why am I eating this
so hard?

1556
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:12.333
I've made half a dozen versions.

1557
00:59:12.417 --> 00:59:13.750
They've all been rejected

1558
00:59:13.834 --> 00:59:15.542
by this mystery owner
of Between Two Covers.

1559
00:59:15.625 --> 00:59:17.709
Well. I'm sure that he--
or she--

1560
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:19.291
knows how capable you are.

1561
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.041
It's just a matter of...

1562
00:59:21.125 --> 00:59:23.291
you know. reconceptualizing.

1563
00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:25.875
I think I'm gonna tell them
to find another artist.

1564
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:29.375
What?

1565
00:59:30.458 --> 00:59:31.917
Mom. you can tell me.

1566
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.625
I don't want to wear out
my welcome that quickly.

1567
00:59:33.709 --> 00:59:35.083
Mom...

1568
00:59:35.166 --> 00:59:37.250
Your dad was always
so good at this.

1569
00:59:37.333 --> 00:59:39.333
He always knew what to say.
when to say it.

1570
00:59:39.417 --> 00:59:41.083
how to say it.

1571
00:59:41.166 --> 00:59:43.291
[sighs]

1572
00:59:43.375 --> 00:59:46.083
I mean. it really was
because of him

1573
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.917
that I finished my first book.

1574
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.792
[chuckles]

1575
00:59:49.875 --> 00:59:50.917
Yeah. I think
he's the only reason

1576
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
I ever finished art school.

1577
00:59:52.083 --> 00:59:54.041
See?

1578
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:56.000
I mean. sometimes.

1579
00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:58.917
I feel like
I'm trying to be helpful.

1580
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.291
but it just comes off
as criticism.

1581
01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:05.041
Well. that's not
entirely inaccurate.

1582
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.291
but this time.

1583
01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:08.709
I am asking for your feedback.

1584
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:09.709
So.

1585
01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:10.917
lay it on me.

1586
01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.250
Well...

1587
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.875
just maybe
you're focusing too much

1588
01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:18.125
on the business.

1589
01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:21.333
You know. where are people
that make Pennfield special

1590
01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.709
and unique?

1591
01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:26.000
You know. not the--
not the dead. famous authors.

1592
01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:29.250
but the real
flesh-and-blood people.

1593
01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:34.041
Hmm.

1594
01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.125
Thanks. Mom.

1595
01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:36.583
All right.

1596
01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:38.875
So. now that
I have solved your problem.

1597
01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:41.250
I need you to help me with mine.

1598
01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:46.917
So. now that we've established

1599
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.125
I am completely capable

1600
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.250
of opening and closing
on my own.

1601
01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:51.583
I think it's time

1602
01:00:51.667 --> 01:00:53.709
for a serious discussion
regarding my compensation.

1603
01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.041
Aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?

1604
01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.917
Too many women
sell themselves short

1605
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.917
with salary negotiations.

1606
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.166
Hannah. you're not wrong.

1607
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.083
and I would love
to give you a raise.

1608
01:01:03.166 --> 01:01:04.291
but I'm just--

1609
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:05.250
I'm stretched
as thin as I can right now.

1610
01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:06.291
So. what you're saying is

1611
01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:08.959
if profits go up.
I get my raise?

1612
01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.250
You make it sound so easy.

1613
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:12.667
[Hannah] No worries. boss.

1614
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.291
I got you.

1615
01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:20.041
So. another date
with the hot doc?

1616
01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.458
What's it this time?

1617
01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:22.959
Movie under the stars?

1618
01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.583
Conceptual pottery class?

1619
01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.333
Are you adopting a cat together?

1620
01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:28.041
Slow down.

1621
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.583
We've only had
a handful of dates.

1622
01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:30.709
I don't know.

1623
01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:31.917
I believe
that's a very typical timeline

1624
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.750
for co-parenting a cat
with another woman.

1625
01:01:33.834 --> 01:01:34.875
[Taylor] Uh-huh.

1626
01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.834
I will see you
first thing tomorrow.

1627
01:01:36.917 --> 01:01:39.125
Don't burn the place down.

1628
01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:40.583
Okay. I only saged it once.

1629
01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:42.208
And the fire was completely--

1630
01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:45.333
--contained.

1631
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.917
All right. family dinner.
let's do this.

1632
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.792
For once. I have a lot
to fill you in on.

1633
01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:57.375
[♪♪]

1634
01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.792
Hey. honey.
I hope you don't mind.

1635
01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:00.291
I am cooking tonight.

1636
01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:03.417
What is going on?

1637
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.417
Mom's kind of. uh.
staying here now.

1638
01:02:07.917 --> 01:02:09.458
You set me up.

1639
01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:12.333
No. no. no. no.
no one set anybody up.

1640
01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.083
It's family dinner tonight.

1641
01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.542
and I'm part of the family...

1642
01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.083
still.

1643
01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.625
You know. I had a lot that
I needed to talk to you about.

1644
01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:20.625
alone.

1645
01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:22.667
Tay. come on.

1646
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:23.917
It's one dinner.

1647
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.250
See you next week.

1648
01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.083
Taylor.

1649
01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.750
You're gonna make me chase you?

1650
01:02:32.834 --> 01:02:34.625
Come on. Tay. wait.

1651
01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:36.291
Look. I should've told you
she was here.

1652
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.208
but I didn't think you'd come.

1653
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:38.709
Of course. I wouldn't have!

1654
01:02:38.792 --> 01:02:40.875
I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

1655
01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:42.834
You can make nice with her
all you want.

1656
01:02:42.917 --> 01:02:44.250
I am not interested.

1657
01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:45.417
There are things
she wants to tell you.

1658
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.542
needs to tell you. okay.

1659
01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:48.959
and I can't...

1660
01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.667
I can't choose
between you two anymore.

1661
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:51.917
[scoffs]

1662
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Look. this isn't
what Dad would've wanted.

1663
01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.375
for any of us.

1664
01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:58.667
I'm not ready.

1665
01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.583
I...

1666
01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:02.959
I just. I really wanted
to talk to my brother tonight.

1667
01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:04.458
And you still can.

1668
01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:06.542
Do you really want to play
fake. happy family

1669
01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:07.875
all dinner?

1670
01:03:07.959 --> 01:03:09.709
No.

1671
01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:13.000
Okay. no dinner.

1672
01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:14.625
Change of plans.

1673
01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:31.792
[♪♪]

1674
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.417
[Taylor] Hey. not bad!

1675
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.667
You have impeccable form.

1676
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.333
and. uh. really bad aim.

1677
01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.250
Why do I remember being
so much better at this?

1678
01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:43.750
Because Dad always
let us use bumpers.

1679
01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:44.583
No. he didn't.

1680
01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:45.583
Yeah. he did.

1681
01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:46.542
until you hit puberty.

1682
01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.291
and started growing a mustache.

1683
01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:49.375
My turn.

1684
01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.333
Watch and learn. bro.

1685
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.750
[laughs] No...

1686
01:03:55.834 --> 01:03:57.834
-Mm-hmm.
-No.

1687
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:58.625
It's all in the walk.

1688
01:03:58.709 --> 01:03:59.625
I don't know her.

1689
01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.417
What?

1690
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.875
Thank you very much.

1691
01:04:08.959 --> 01:04:09.834
That looked ridiculous.

1692
01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:11.166
That does not count.

1693
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.375
Zachary. Zachary. Zachary.

1694
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.041
You gotta just find
what works for you

1695
01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:16.333
and quit worrying
what it looks like

1696
01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:18.125
to everyone else.

1697
01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:20.208
Okay. Yoda.

1698
01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:21.083
[chuckles]

1699
01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:22.333
No Slushie for you.

1700
01:04:22.417 --> 01:04:23.417
Yeah?

1701
01:04:27.959 --> 01:04:30.375
Zach...

1702
01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:33.166
this was a really good idea.

1703
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:35.000
Mostly because I'm winning.

1704
01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.917
Okay.

1705
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.125
Oh!

1706
01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:44.208
That's right.

1707
01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.291
Margot.

1708
01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:50.834
[chuckles]

1709
01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:53.625
I guess the bowling league
lured you back in. huh?

1710
01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:54.667
Or you're here with a. um...?

1711
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:57.125
Bowling league?

1712
01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:58.083
Yeah. guilty as charged.

1713
01:04:58.166 --> 01:04:59.750
Actually.

1714
01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:02.333
I've been planting
the seeds of revolution.

1715
01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:03.625
Trying to unseat
the power-tripping despot

1716
01:05:03.709 --> 01:05:04.583
who runs it.

1717
01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.333
Oh. yeah.

1718
01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:07.583
I can see that.

1719
01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:08.959
You know. I could always. uh.

1720
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:11.000
infiltrate the team

1721
01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:12.291
and help bring him down
or something.

1722
01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.500
[scoffs]

1723
01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:15.917
Actually. I'd love that.

1724
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.709
Great. I'll put it
on my calendar.

1725
01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:18.750
[laughing]

1726
01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:20.959
Hey. Zach. you ready to go?

1727
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.458
Yeah. Margot. this is Taylor.

1728
01:05:23.542 --> 01:05:24.667
my sister.

1729
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.875
Yeah. uh. Taylor.
this is Margot.

1730
01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:28.917
she manages the bookstore.

1731
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.250
It is really nice to meet you.

1732
01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:33.208
I'm super impressed with
what you've done with the place.

1733
01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:34.500
Oh. thanks.

1734
01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:36.709
It'll be even better
once Zach's mural is up.

1735
01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:38.083
Yeah. about that.

1736
01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:41.375
Um. I think I may have
something for you soon.

1737
01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.041
Really?

1738
01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:44.208
-Really?
-Yeah.

1739
01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:46.166
Mom helped me with it. weirdly.

1740
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:48.542
Well. I. uh.

1741
01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:49.959
I can't wait to see it.

1742
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:52.333
and I'll keep you in the loop
about the. uh.

1743
01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:53.375
the revolution.

1744
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.333
Yes. Revolución.

1745
01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:56.333
[laughs]

1746
01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:58.709
[they chuckle awkwardly]

1747
01:05:58.792 --> 01:06:01.333
Well. uh.
have a good. uh. bowl...

1748
01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:02.333
[muttering awkwardly]

1749
01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:03.333
Thanks.

1750
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.792
It's so nice meeting you.

1751
01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:05.959
-Yeah.
-We're gonna go now.

1752
01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:08.000
-Bye.
-I'll... I'll send you the--

1753
01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:09.208
Yup. He'll do the thing.

1754
01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:10.375
Bye!

1755
01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:11.375
[Zach] I can't believe
I said that--

1756
01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:12.375
What happened to you back there!

1757
01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:13.208
I don't know!

1758
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:14.417
It just came out of my mouth.

1759
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.709
Oh. my gosh.

1760
01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:18.291
You should ask her out.

1761
01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.250
but. like.
on a real date. please?

1762
01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.166
Don't take her bowling.

1763
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.458
It is not romantic.

1764
01:06:22.542 --> 01:06:24.500
Yeah. I don't think
she's interested.

1765
01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:26.875
She's definitely interested.

1766
01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:28.500
Yeah. you don't know
this girl.

1767
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.208
She's got
a very strong opinion

1768
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.041
about women's independence.
I'm telling you.

1769
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.917
She also had a very strong
opinion about your butt.

1770
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.291
[laughing] No.

1771
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:37.959
We're not going there.
We're not discussing that.

1772
01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:39.208
Why not?

1773
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.000
Well. first off.

1774
01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.375
since when did are you
the authority on dating?

1775
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.917
You haven't dated anybody
since. what. college?

1776
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.208
I'm actually
seeing someone now.

1777
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.417
No. you aren't.

1778
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.583
I am.

1779
01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:53.625
I swear.

1780
01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.041
It's. uh... it's new.

1781
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:59.500
but it's actually
going really well.

1782
01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.500
Taylor!
[laughing fondly]

1783
01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:04.291
That's why
I freaked out about dinner.

1784
01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:05.875
I wanted to tell you.

1785
01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:07.083
What. you didn't want
Mom to know

1786
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:09.291
you were dating someone?

1787
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.291
I didn't want Mom to know

1788
01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:14.250
that I am dating a woman.

1789
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.250
Oh.

1790
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.208
Not...
Not because she's a she.

1791
01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:22.750
Just...

1792
01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:26.750
Like. Mom and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

1793
01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:31.000
I can't talk to her
about the big stuff.

1794
01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:33.709
Well. maybe
she can't talk to you. either.

1795
01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:35.250
Either way.

1796
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:38.333
I don't need her
pretending to care.

1797
01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:44.250
I wouldn't hate some help
from you. though.

1798
01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:46.333
Can you please say something?

1799
01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:48.917
I don't know what to say.

1800
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.250
I mean...

1801
01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.166
does it really matter?

1802
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.417
Does it make a difference?

1803
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.375
I mean. I don't care
if you date a woman.

1804
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.959
or a man. or both.

1805
01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.959
just as long as whoever it is

1806
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.667
is good to you.

1807
01:08:05.792 --> 01:08:07.500
Did I say the wrong thing?

1808
01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:15.208
You said
exactly the right thing.

1809
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.417
You're the first person
I've told.

1810
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.417
besides Hannah.

1811
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.750
You told Hannah before me?

1812
01:08:21.834 --> 01:08:25.500
I may or may not
have briefly spiraled.

1813
01:08:25.583 --> 01:08:26.875
[laughs]

1814
01:08:26.959 --> 01:08:29.250
Well. I think it's great.

1815
01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:31.375
So. what will I refer
to this woman as?

1816
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:34.041
I can't just keep calling her
"this woman".

1817
01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:35.500
-Franki.
-Okay.

1818
01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:37.083
Francesca.

1819
01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:39.959
Um. from Classifie.

1820
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.500
You didn't.

1821
01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.625
I definitely did.

1822
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:44.959
[cell phone rings]

1823
01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:46.250
Yeah. you should take that.

1824
01:08:46.333 --> 01:08:47.750
She probably thinks
I murdered you

1825
01:08:47.834 --> 01:08:48.834
and absconded with the body.

1826
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.583
Ha ha.

1827
01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.834
Hey. Mom.

1828
01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:54.083
Yeah. it's fine. we're just...

1829
01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:56.834
Yes.

1830
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.500
We'll be right there.

1831
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.166
We gotta go.

1832
01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.417
That was Pennfield General.

1833
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.875
Mom's just been admitted.

1834
01:09:04.959 --> 01:09:06.333
Oh. my gosh.

1835
01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:14.625
Mom!

1836
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:16.500
You had a heart attack
and you weren't gonna tell us?

1837
01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:18.917
Oh. Dr. Murray.
these are my children.

1838
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.250
My son. Zach.

1839
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:22.000
and my daughter. Taylor.

1840
01:09:22.083 --> 01:09:24.291
Hi. Dr. Francesca Murray.
Nice to meet you.

1841
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:25.417
Are you kidding me right now?

1842
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.000
-Taylor?
-Zach.

1843
01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:28.500
Perhaps we should discuss
your mother's condition.

1844
01:09:28.583 --> 01:09:29.834
-Yes.
-Yes. please.

1845
01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:31.959
Uh. excuse me. yes.
very interested.

1846
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.041
but. um. first.

1847
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:34.291
could someone tell me
who this is?

1848
01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:35.667
That's Brian.

1849
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.875
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

1850
01:09:37.959 --> 01:09:40.041
Great. Now that
that's perfectly clear.

1851
01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:41.667
Taylor. please.
Dr. Murray was going to--

1852
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:42.667
Would you prefer
if we spoke in private?

1853
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:43.917
No. no. no.

1854
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.583
No. I am done
keeping secrets from them.

1855
01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:48.250
That is what got me here
in the first place.

1856
01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.291
[Franki] Well. Based on
what I'm seeing.

1857
01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:51.750
Emilia is no longer
suffering from a heart attack.

1858
01:09:51.834 --> 01:09:53.125
[sighs in relief]

1859
01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:54.542
She is. however. suffering
from a panic disorder.

1860
01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.792
which could trigger
many of the same symptoms.

1861
01:09:56.875 --> 01:09:59.250
shortness of breath.
tightness in the chest.

1862
01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:00.667
The good news is.

1863
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.000
that it doesn't cause
the same sort of physical damage

1864
01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:03.041
to the heart muscle.

1865
01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.166
and now that we know
what's going on.

1866
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.000
we can more effectively
treat it.

1867
01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.208
Well. you were
pretty upset earlier.

1868
01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:08.458
could that cause
a panic attack?

1869
01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:10.458
Emotional upset
can absolutely be a factor.

1870
01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:11.750
Yes.

1871
01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.291
Okay. so. uh.
so it's our fault then.

1872
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.500
or my fault. rather.

1873
01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:17.333
Right?
Right. Franki?

1874
01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:21.166
Uh. there can be any number
of contributing factors.

1875
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.166
Wait. this is good news. right?

1876
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.417
Yeah.

1877
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.417
Wait. wait. wait. Franki?
Like. Franki Franki?

1878
01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:30.583
Did you know
that she was Mom's doctor?

1879
01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:32.208
Till 20 minutes ago.

1880
01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:33.500
I didn't even know
Mom had a doctor.

1881
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:34.875
What am I missing here?

1882
01:10:34.959 --> 01:10:37.208
[Taylor] You know what.
I am gonna go get some air.

1883
01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:38.917
Does anyone need anything?

1884
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.875
No? Good.

1885
01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.500
Zach. will you go
check on your sister. please?

1886
01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:49.291
-Yeah.
-You know what. let me.

1887
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.417
You should stay with your mom.

1888
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:55.625
What is going on there?

1889
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:57.500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1890
01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:58.959
Okay. but they know each other.

1891
01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:00.375
Yeah. no. it seems like it.
doesn't it?

1892
01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:01.458
Yeah.

1893
01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:02.959
but she's a cardiologist.

1894
01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:04.333
and your sister pots plants.

1895
01:11:04.417 --> 01:11:05.750
I mean. they don't exactly.
you know.

1896
01:11:05.834 --> 01:11:07.375
move around
in the same circles.

1897
01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:08.458
Maybe we should just put
the oxygen back on.

1898
01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:09.500
They'll be back in a minute.
We can--

1899
01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:11.083
But they're friends!

1900
01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.667
Mm-hmm. yeah. no.
it looks like that. yeah--

1901
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.291
Like. friends
with palpable tension.

1902
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.291
Hmm.

1903
01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:17.750
Are they involved?

1904
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.041
Should I get a nurse?
Are you okay?

1905
01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.250
No. do not get a nurse.

1906
01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:25.875
My daughter
is dating a doctor.

1907
01:11:27.834 --> 01:11:30.000
[♪♪]

1908
01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:33.291
[Franki]
I didn't make the connection

1909
01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:35.417
until she listed you
as her emergency contact.

1910
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.917
You never talk about your mom.

1911
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.917
My last name wasn't
a giant red flag for you?

1912
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.166
No. it wasn't.

1913
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.375
"Rooting4U."

1914
01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:44.333
Right.

1915
01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:46.291
Even if I had found out sooner.

1916
01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.542
I don't regret
getting to know you.

1917
01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:51.041
I wouldn't take that back
for anything.

1918
01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:53.834
She listed me
as her emergency contact?

1919
01:11:53.917 --> 01:11:55.792
You and your brother.

1920
01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:58.000
We've barely spoken in years.

1921
01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:01.208
I know I'm just
getting to know Emilia.

1922
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:02.834
and I know she puts on
a tough front.

1923
01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:05.583
but I think she's got
a lot of regrets.

1924
01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.834
Well. she should.

1925
01:12:07.917 --> 01:12:10.917
She came a long way
to seek this treatment.

1926
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.083
She could have gone
to another specialist

1927
01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:13.125
in another city.

1928
01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:14.083
and she didn't.

1929
01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:15.125
She came here

1930
01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:16.500
to be near you.

1931
01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:17.750
Hmm.

1932
01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:20.875
You didn't tell me
you were a therapist. too.

1933
01:12:20.959 --> 01:12:22.000
Taylor.

1934
01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:23.166
How would you feel

1935
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.083
if it had been
another heart attack?

1936
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.166
Is this how you'd want
to leave things with your mom?

1937
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:29.667
You know. you said so yourself.
you're just getting to know her.

1938
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.750
I have had
decades of experience.

1939
01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:33.125
Panic disorder?

1940
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:35.500
No. it's Emilia
got her feelings hurt.

1941
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.750
and then she called
a doting admirer

1942
01:12:37.834 --> 01:12:39.000
to come comfort her.

1943
01:12:39.083 --> 01:12:39.959
and now the whole
rest of the world

1944
01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:41.458
has to stop to accommodate her.

1945
01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:42.709
You're wrong...

1946
01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.875
Wow.

1947
01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.625
...and you're being
sort of cynical.

1948
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.208
which is not your best look.

1949
01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:49.000
If that's
what you think of me--

1950
01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.291
That's how you're behaving.

1951
01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.834
How about I just make it
really easy for us then.

1952
01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:58.166
From now on.
let's just stick to our jobs.

1953
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.083
[♪♪]

1954
01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:10.083
Finished all my tasks...

1955
01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.417
Thanks.

1956
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.458
...and got a head start
on inventory...

1957
01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:14.792
Sounds good.

1958
01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:17.041
...and since you're suddenly
all checked out.

1959
01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:19.834
I'll be heading up
our new marketing push myself.

1960
01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.250
Great. thanks.

1961
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.959
Wait...

1962
01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:26.542
What new marketing push?

1963
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.834
Look. boss. it's clear to me

1964
01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:31.792
you've got a lot of life stuff
you're dealing with right now.

1965
01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.041
so I'm more than happy

1966
01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:34.834
to take on the store stuff
for a while.

1967
01:13:34.917 --> 01:13:36.500

1968
01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.834

"Plant daddies"?

Well. I was gonna go for

All I'm asking
is for you to give it a chance.

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:09.667
Increased foot traffic

1982
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.083

for the discount.

Um. what increased
foot traffic?

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.041

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.583
You do remember
I own this place. yeah?

1994

Yes.

1995
01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:32.250
and on that note.

1996
01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:33.959
I was hoping to petition you

1997
01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:36.542
for a slight alteration
to the schedule.

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:38.709

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:51.500
Sorry.

2005
01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:53.291
I've been obsessed
with your mom's spy novels

2006
01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:54.375
ever since my aunt

2007
01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:55.875
inappropriately
gifted them to me

2008
01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:57.709
thinking they were travel guides
for young adults.

2009
01:14:57.792 --> 01:14:59.959
It's fine. Go.

I'm gonna say something.

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:10.041
and hope you don't
fire me. okay?

2015
01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:12.375
Well. I haven't fired you yet.
have I?

you know?

Let alone wildly creative

2018

and complicated type moms

2019
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:24.542
that don't just tell you.
but also show you

2020
01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:27.000
how you could be whatever
you want to be when you grow up.

2021
01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.208
Look. Hannah.
I know you mean well--

I'm just saying.
that those types of people

2023
01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:32.709

I know.

2029
01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:44.625

2030
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:46.583
look.

2031
01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.917
I mean. look how much
your world has grown.

2032
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.375
and maybe hers has. too.

2033
01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:51.583
and that's why she's back.

Really. how are you gonna know.
unless you just. you know...

2035

Am I fired?

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:05.667
No.

2038
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.291
No. you're not fired.

2039

You're right.

2040

that I know.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.125

No. no.
but as your best friend.

it's my job
to blindly protect you.

this is entirely on her.

No. you give great advice.

finally got out of his own way.

that he's got a soft spot
for my mom.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.542
Not at all.

adore Emilia.

The town deserves it.

captured your essence.

Oh. really?

2128
01:19:22.917 --> 01:19:25.375

much luck with love

and ask the girl out.

run that by your boss.

2139
01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.917
Uh...

2140
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.792
did we just
make that happen?

2141
01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.542
I think that might be
Brian's very subtle way

2142
01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:03.041
of telling me to go do my job.

2143
01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:05.208
[chuckles] Right.

2144
01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:06.166
Find me after?

2145
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.375
Definitely.

2146
01:20:11.542 --> 01:20:12.500
[chuckles]

2147
01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:16.458
[clears throat nervously]

2148
01:20:16.542 --> 01:20:18.375
Zach!

2149
01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:20.041
-Dr. Murray!
-Hey.

2150
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:21.083
I didn't know you were coming.

2151
01:20:21.166 --> 01:20:22.166
Honestly. I didn't either.

2152
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.709
until Emilia sent me the invite.

2153
01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:25.125
I wasn't sure I'd be welcome.

2154
01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:26.583
Of course you are.

2155
01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:30.375
but. um. I don't think
Taylor's going to show up. so...

2156
01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.250
but. hey. if you wouldn't mind.

2157
01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:33.333
would you maybe

2158
01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.041
-help me keep an eye on Mom?
-Yeah.

2159
01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.166
Make sure she doesn't overdo it.

2160
01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:37.500
Franki.

2161
01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.208
have you seen this?

2162
01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.083
I'm gonna sue for infringement.

2163
01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:41.250
Infringement on what?

2164
01:20:41.333 --> 01:20:43.667
My impeccable jawline.
for starters.

2165
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.208
-[laughing]
-Okay. technically.

2166
01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:46.458
that's covered
under artistic license. so...

2167
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.709
Does she know
that you painted her?

2168
01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:52.959
She's been pretty distant
since the hospital.

2169
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.041
I take it she hasn't...

2170
01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.959
No.

2171
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:58.750
You wanna know the worst thing
about my sister?

2172
01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:00.208
Besides her bowling technique.

2173
01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:01.208
Her clogs?

2174
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.250
[chuckles]

2175
01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:03.458
Hmm...

2176
01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:04.875
[chuckling]

2177
01:21:04.959 --> 01:21:06.959
The person
she's best at punishing

2178
01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:08.500
is herself.

2179
01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:11.417
Yup.

2180
01:21:13.166 --> 01:21:15.917
[Margot] Good evening.
dear book lovers.

2181
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.083
Without further ado.

2182
01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:20.667
Between Two Covers
is thrilled to introduce

2183
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.542
a woman who needs
no introduction.

2184
01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:25.417
Pennfield's very own
Queen of Romance.

2185
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.500
author Emilia Bloom.

2186
01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:31.166
[applause and cheers]

2187
01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:36.041
Hello. hello.

2188
01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.583
[excited cheering]

2189
01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:16.709
-[cheering continues]
-Aw. thank you so much.

2190
01:22:16.792 --> 01:22:18.083
Thank you. Margot.

2191
01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:21.041
and a special thank you
to Between Two Covers

2192
01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:22.542
for hosting me tonight.

2193
01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:25.834
I look forward to signing
everyone's copies of my books...

2194
01:22:25.917 --> 01:22:27.125
[laughs]

2195
01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.125
...after I have read
an excerpt

2196
01:22:29.208 --> 01:22:30.417
from my latest novel.

2197
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:31.667
"The Problem with Prague."

2198
01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:36.291
Well. I have done this
a few thousand times.

2199
01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:37.917
but tonight
just feels different.

2200
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.041
Um...

2201
01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:41.375
Since coming home to Pennfield.

2202
01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:45.125
I've just. uh. felt...

2203
01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:51.834
Well. it's been. um...

2204
01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:53.375
it's been an awakening.

2205
01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:59.208
I left Pennfield
five years ago.

2206
01:22:59.291 --> 01:23:00.166
after my husband passed away.

2207
01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:01.041
Well. left.

2208
01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:02.583
Fled.

2209
01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.542
The semantics are debatable.

2210
01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:06.208
The reality is

2211
01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:07.834
that I. uh...

2212
01:23:07.917 --> 01:23:09.083
I abandoned my children.

2213
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.375
They were grown children.

2214
01:23:13.458 --> 01:23:16.917
but. um...

2215
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.875
I stranded them
to handle their grief alone.

2216
01:23:21.959 --> 01:23:23.625
and for that I am very sorry.

2217
01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.625
The thing is.

2218
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:28.834
I really am not trying
to make excuses here.

2219
01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:32.250
but I could not imagine
spending the rest of my life

2220
01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:33.667
in the place
that I'd raised my family

2221
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.333
without their father by my side.

2222
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:48.250
I assume
you've all read my books?

2223
01:23:48.333 --> 01:23:50.000
[murmurs and chuckles
of agreement]

2224
01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.250
Sometimes--

2225
01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:53.166
well. often--

2226
01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:55.709
I write about love

2227
01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:59.166
more nimbly
than I manage it for myself.

2228
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.917
and I have missed out
on so much

2229
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.792
while I've been away.

2230
01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:06.083
This mural behind me.

2231
01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.291
this was painted

2232
01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.792
by my extraordinarily
talented son.

2233
01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:14.959
He is an artist.

2234
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:16.417
like me.

2235
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:21.542
but he sculpts his worlds
with shape and color

2236
01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:24.667
instead of dusty. old words...

2237
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:30.417
...and he always sees
the best in everyone.

2238
01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.208
even when they let him down...

2239
01:24:35.166 --> 01:24:37.458
...and there I go
talking about myself again...

2240
01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:39.959
[laughter]

2241
01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.083
But that is a thing

2242
01:24:41.166 --> 01:24:42.959
that my daughter
might say about me.

2243
01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:45.083
and. you know. she is not wrong.

2244
01:24:45.166 --> 01:24:47.500
but she. too. is a bit of chip
off the old block.

2245
01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.166
and she is living proof

2246
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.834
that. sometimes.
being stubborn and driven

2247
01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:53.917
is not a bad thing.

2248
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.333
because without any help
from anyone.

2249
01:24:56.417 --> 01:24:57.709
least of all me.

2250
01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.458
she has opened "The Bloomeria."

2251
01:24:59.542 --> 01:25:00.375
just down the street.

2252
01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:02.709
a beautiful plant store.

2253
01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:04.208
You should all go down there

2254
01:25:04.291 --> 01:25:06.125
and see what her hard work
and vision has created...

2255
01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:09.291
[applause]

2256
01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:13.250
...and I wish she knew
how proud I am

2257
01:25:13.333 --> 01:25:15.208
of every brave choice

2258
01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:18.417
she has made for herself.

2259
01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.333
I just wish
she would reconsider

2260
01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:21.875
calling it off
with my cardiologist.

2261
01:25:21.959 --> 01:25:24.375
and I am happy to accept
a referral elsewhere

2262
01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:25.500
if that's what it takes.

2263
01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:29.417
All of that to say.

2264
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.667
that going forward.

2265
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.500
in my personal life
and with my writing.

2266
01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:36.667
I want to pay tribute

2267
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:38.625
to the more complicated
love stories

2268
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:39.959
that surround us.

2269
01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:42.333
because they're not
all flawless.

2270
01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:45.250
They're not all romantic.

2271
01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:47.792
They're not all expected.

2272
01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:51.041
And I don't need
to transport myself

2273
01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:52.083
or my readers

2274
01:25:52.166 --> 01:25:54.834
to some far-flung country

2275
01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.375
to find those love stories.

2276
01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:59.375
Sometimes. they're just
right around the corner.

2277
01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.667
Sometimes.

2278
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:04.000
it's even on Classifie.

2279
01:26:04.083 --> 01:26:06.542
[laughter]

2280
01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:08.208
"Local Author

2281

2282
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:12.709
[muttering]
That sounds oddly familiar.

2283
01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.083
"Just back in town

and new friends alike.

2286
01:26:18.041 --> 01:26:20.792
Let's write
a beautiful story together.

2287
01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:24.125
My chat is open."

2288
01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:27.500
[cheering and applause]

2289
01:26:31.083 --> 01:26:32.583
All right.
shall we get started?

2290
01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:33.750
[crowd shouts] Yes!

2291
01:26:33.834 --> 01:26:34.667
[chuckles] Okay.

2292
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:37.166
"The Problem With Prague."

2293
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.125
Chapter One.

stretched from her right hip.
up along..."

2297
01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:49.500
[♪♪]

2298
01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.542
Cheers.

2299
01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:01.750
Flower queen comin' through!

2300
01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:04.125
Beautiful.

2301
01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:05.375
Right here. my dear.

2302
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.250
Hey. Mom.

2303
01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:10.125
you planning on joining us
anytime soon?

2304
01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:11.625
Yes. absolutely.

2305
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:13.083
just. sometimes.

2306
01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:15.625
you have to get it down
when the inspiration strikes.

2307
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:16.709
Making progress. then?

2308
01:27:16.792 --> 01:27:18.583
Ooh. I don't want
to jinx it. so...

2309
01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:20.792
no. absolutely not.

2310
01:27:20.875 --> 01:27:22.959
Have you given my question
any more thought?

2311
01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:24.709
The "Do I want to move home?"
question?

2312
01:27:24.792 --> 01:27:26.667
I have. and definitely not.

2313
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.125
Business is picking up.

2314
01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:29.875
Oh. my book-signing
appeal perhaps?

2315
01:27:29.959 --> 01:27:31.375
Hannah's ad.

2316
01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:33.750
We're rolling in plant parents
and "garden gnomies".

2317
01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:34.959
or whatever she called them.

2318
01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:36.250
She's more than earned
her raise.

2319
01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:37.625
and your boyfriend

2320
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:38.667
has brought a very nice
bottle of wine with him.

2321
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:40.083
He is not my boyfriend.
he's just--

2322
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:41.917
[together]
--an old college friend.

2323
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:42.834
Sure. Mom.

2324
01:27:42.917 --> 01:27:43.834
Funny. though.

2325
01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:44.959
Zach did mention

2326
01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:46.166
that you haven't been home
most nights

2327
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.333
when he goes to bed.

2328
01:27:47.417 --> 01:27:48.625
even when he's out late
with Margot.

2329
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:50.125
Hmm.

2330
01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:52.000
Well. your brother and I

2331
01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:53.417
are gonna need to have
a little chat

2332
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.000
about what percentage
of my royalties

2333
01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:57.166
he can expect to inherit

2334
01:27:57.250 --> 01:27:59.125
if he can't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

2335
01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.125
-[doorbell rings]
-Can you get that?

2336
01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:03.750
I need to have a little chat
with your brother.

2337
01:28:03.834 --> 01:28:04.834
Yeah.

2338
01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:08.417
So...

2339
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.166
what have you
been telling them?

2340
01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.917
[laughs]

2341
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.208
Don't tell my girlfriend

2342
01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.458
that I went to the other
plant shop in town.

2343
01:28:18.542 --> 01:28:20.291
Your girlfriend
will forgive you this time.

2344
01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:21.875
Good.

2345
01:28:21.959 --> 01:28:25.333
[♪♪]

2346
01:28:25.417 --> 01:28:26.500
Mm.

2347
01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:27.917
How are things going
with your mom?

2348
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.208
She's trying. I'm trying.

2349
01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:31.542
We're all just...

2350
01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:34.542
"Blooming where you're planted?"

2351
01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:35.875
-Oh...
-[laughing]

2352
01:28:35.959 --> 01:28:38.291
Zach is never gonna
live that down. is he?

2353
01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:39.667
No. never!

2354
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:41.083
I love it.

2355
01:28:42.667 --> 01:28:44.709
Um. excuse me!

2356
01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:47.500
Hi. ladies. sorry to interrupt.

2357
01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.959
Is this Emilia Bloom's house?

2358
01:28:50.041 --> 01:28:52.000
Is she on some Map of the Stars
or something?

2359
01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:55.166
Does Pennfield have
a Map of the Stars?

2360
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:57.041
[squeals] Ah!
I thought that was you!

2361
01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.333
There she is!

2362
01:28:58.417 --> 01:28:59.834
Oh. ladies. this is not
some crazed fan.

2363
01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:01.583
This is my editor. Graham!

2364
01:29:01.667 --> 01:29:03.125
I'm so glad you could make it.

2365
01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:04.500
[kisses] Well.

2366
01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:05.709
my bestselling author
promised me a new book.

2367
01:29:05.792 --> 01:29:06.959
-Yes.
-How's it going?

2368
01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.208
It's coming. it's coming.

2369
01:29:08.291 --> 01:29:10.291
and I am doing
something different.

2370
01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:11.417
I'm going to tell you
all about it after dinner.

2371
01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:13.875
This is about to get
really interesting.

2372
01:29:13.959 --> 01:29:14.959
Why is that?

2373
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:17.375
He is totally Max's type.

2374
01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.041
-Oh. really?
-Yeah.

2375
01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:20.875
Then we should go get
good seats.

2376
01:29:20.959 --> 01:29:22.208
Yes.

2377
01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:25.709
It's so good to see you.

2378
01:29:27.834 --> 01:29:31.417
[♪♪]

2379
01:29:37.583 --> 01:29:41.333
