3
00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.558
Time to rest. darling.

4
00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.562
Let's put this away.

5
00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.026
Shh.

6
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.364
Hide. hide.

7
00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:35.904
You stay there!

8
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.424
Maksim.

9
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.550
Yes. mother.

10
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.891
I have a gift for you.

11
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.645
Whoa!

12
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.518
It's just like the one
that Ivan has.

13
00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:19.737
Do you like it?

14
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.741
I do.

15
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:26.404
This is the symbol
of our family.

16
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.827
Go and learn from your father.

17
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:30.950
become a great hunter.

18
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.912
And catch me some dinner.

19
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.467
What are you so happy about?

20
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.586
I let you win.

21
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:07.973
Ti know.

22
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.313
Petro!

23
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.730
What do you think of this one?

24
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.201
Fine quality. eh?

25
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.126
Sharp.

26
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.129
Strong.

27
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.883
Yes. great.

28
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:45.966
Yes.

29
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.634
We will go hunting
after the festival.

30
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.881
Right. next time.

31
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.602
Yes.

32
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.112
Not only are they
killing my sheep.

33
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.658
my horse stables were
burnt to the ground.

34
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.032
This lawlessness can
not continue.

35
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.374
Tugar volk must leave our lands.

36
00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.374
I can not exile tugar volk

37
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.797
without calling him to our
council meeting

38
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.011
and hearing what he has to say.

39
00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.471
He will never show.

40
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.340
He thinks he's above us.

41
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.345
I know you and he are
not from tukhlia.

42
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.940
but you fought alongside
this man in kolka.

43
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.101
Why can you not get
through to him?

44
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.862
That was a long time ago.

45
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.740
He is not the same man he
was back then.

46
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:04.632
Maksim!

47
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.048
Yes father?

48
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.794
Tugar volk needs a guide to
help him hunt a bear

49
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.170
that has been seen
near his estate.

50
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.138
You will lead the hunt
and then use it

51
00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.849
to ask him to come to our
next town meeting.

52
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.889
Do it in a way that he
agrees to come.

53
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.146
But. father. I'm not the most

54
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.060
appropriate person for this job.

55
00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:23.932
Why not send Ivan?

56
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.059
He speaks better than I.

57
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.025
Then it is settled.

58
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.449
You will ride in the morning.

59
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.455
People say that tugar volk's
daughter is very beautiful.

60
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.915
Well. if she's anything
like her father.

61
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.786
she probably has a face that
would scare away the wolves.

62
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.837
Then the two of you will be a

63
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.171
perfect match for each other.

64
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:50.928
Tvan!

65
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.754
You talk too much.

66
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.218
You will be going with him.

67
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.979
Guess we get to see
for ourselves.

68
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:03.983
Shut up.

69
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.201
Whoever you are. you
have much stronger

70
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.695
hands than my husband.

71
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.996
Is that right?

72
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.253
He keeps asking when he can go
hunting with you.

73
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:32.636
Ti know.

74
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.509
He's not big enough yet. but
he will be soon.

75
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.969
I'll be going again tomorrow.

76
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.734
Huh.

77
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.020
Buchon will be sad.

78
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.906
Perhaps I will bring him a gift.

79
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.119
You never bring me any gifts.

80
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.737
I thought I was gift enough.

81
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:01.829
You thought wrong.

82
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.668
Did I?

83
00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.182
Are you going to ask him?

84
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.559
Are you going to ask him?

85
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.730
Father tasked you with this job.

86
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.108
This is strange.

87
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.405
They won't recognize your rule.

88
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.620
but they're willing you to
take you on a hunt?

89
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.081
There's no unity.

90
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.121
No unity amongst us anymore.

91
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:50.996
I'll teach them how a true
commander leads.

92
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.170
Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.

93
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.972
Think it's best we go on
foot from here.

94
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.565
If we encounter a beast. it
might startle the horses.

95
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.200
Look.

96
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.865
On the log. bear marks.

97
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.163
Tell the men.

98
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.209
This way!

99
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:54.517
A face that will scare away
the wolves. eh?

100
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.628
Go. I'll get the others!

101
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.458
You all right?

102
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.960
Yes.

103
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.401
What's your name?

104
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.491
Maksim.

105
00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.067
And you?

106
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.078
Myroslava.

107
00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.909
You're the guide
helping my father?

108
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.622
I'm actually here to
help my father.

109
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.961
We need tugar volk to come to
our town meeting.

110
00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.592
In tukhlia.

111
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.595
Tukhlia?

112
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.712
Maksim?

113
00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.639
Everything's all right. Ivan.

114
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:26.523
You first.

115
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.733
No. I insist.

116
00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:30.405
Maksim.

117
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240
Thank you.

118
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.237
Myro!

119
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.248
Myroslava!

120
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.616
Where's my daughter?

121
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:44.993
Myro!

122
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.416
I'm okay. I'm fine.

123
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.630
Take your hands off her.

124
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.634
Please help him.

125
00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:57.714
Ah-ah. leave them. come on.
let's go.

126
00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:58.714
Hunt's over.

127
00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.512
If it wasn't for
Maksim I'd be dead.

128
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.600
Who?

129
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.468
Him.

130
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.515
His name's Maksim.

131
00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.317
Maksim?

132
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.144
And what does Maksim
want for a reward?

133
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.356
I didn't do it for any reward.
sir.

134
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.358
Okay. let's go home.

135
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.234
Wait. he does want something.

136
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.031
Of course he does.

137
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.038
What do you want?

138
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.543
I ask you as a man.
as a warrior.

139
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.288
come to tukhlia for our
village meeting

140
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.005
under the next full moon.

141
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.216
Locals would like to
address their concerns.

142
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.763
Why would I come to a
commoners gathering?

143
00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.472
We're free people just like you.

144
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.267
If you think you and your men
are in the right.

145
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.636
then come and prove it.

146
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.647
No need to hide.

147
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:48.807
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

148
00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.439
I could have you whipped. you
insolent little bastard.

149
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.449
Father!

150
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.412
I'll come to your
peasants meeting.

151
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:05.623
because I choose to.

152
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:08.628
Now.

153
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.630
the hunt is over.

154
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:12.591
Home.

155
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.096
Sometimes I think god
gave me a son.

156
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.316
Gard.

157
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:44.487
Seems like an awful lot of
trouble just to impress a girl.

158
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.663
But well done.

159
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.595
Tugar volk will come to
the town meeting.

160
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:06.558
Well done.

161
00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:07.677
It was all Maksim.

162
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.890
Prepare for the festivities.

163
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.363
Well. how was it?

164
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.614
He met the boyar's daughter.

165
00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.907
Oh?

166
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.155
What's her name?

167
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.166
Myroslava.

168
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.126
He's in love.

169
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.960
Of all the girls to choose from.

170
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.045
you fall in love for the
daughter of tugar volk.

171
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.092
Hello my love.

172
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.104
Why hello.

173
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:53.692
You like her.

174
00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.734
No. it doesn't matter.

175
00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.899
Ivan's right. she's the
daughter of the boyar.

176
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.067
We mean nothing to them.

177
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.118
Really?

178
00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.159
Do you remember what happened

179
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.949
when Ivan sent the matchmakers
to rosana's father?

180
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.073
You mean when zora punched
him in the face.

181
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.574
Exactly. Of course.

182
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.626
He couldn't shoot for a week.

183
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:16.587
That was the funniest thing
I've ever seen.

184
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.670
But look at him now.

185
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:20.465
Sometimes it's worth the risk.

186
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:01.423
Where in god's name do you think
you're going. young lady?

187
00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:02.917
I wanted to pick some berries.

188
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.836
We have servants to do that.

189
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.472
I wanted to pick them myself.

190
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:10.473
Absolutely not.

191
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.261
You never let me go anywhere.

192
00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.982
I've never even been to tukhlia.
I think they call it.

193
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.101
Those people aren't what
you make them out.

194
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:24.657
Myro.

195
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:30.199
those people are fighting
me for our land.

196
00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.367
They give me no respect.

197
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.490
And if you turn your back
on these people.

198
00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:36.917
they'll stick a knife in it.

199
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.752
Then why did one of
them save me?

200
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.879
No daughter of mine will be
picking berries!

201
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.723
Now. you find yourself another
leisurely activity!

202
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.022
To bed. young lady.

203
00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.108
To bed.

204
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:07.742
I love you.

205
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.853
No no no no. it's me. Maksim!

206
00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:39.563
I'm sorry. myroslava.

207
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:40.682
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:42.729
My heart just leaped
out of my chest!

209
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:45.227
I didn't know how else to get
past your servants.

210
00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:47.323
Get down.

211
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:53.368
Sorry. there was no
other way in.

212
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.072
Are you all right?

213
00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.072
What happened?

214
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.084
Nothing!

215
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.956
T saw a rat!

216
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:04.171
Well. open the door. gard
will take care of it.

217
00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.880
No. no. no. it's gone now!

218
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.671
I'm going to bed. goodnight!

219
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:08.667
Are you sure you're okay?

220
00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:09.679
Yes. I'm sure!

221
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:12.971
Goodnight.

222
00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:13.975
Goodnight!

223
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.558
What are you doing here?

224
00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:20.100
I came to invite you to the
festivities. tonight.

225
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.313
Festivities?

226
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.775
Yes. it's a great
celebration for perun.

227
00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:27.110
It's the biggest
festival we have.

228
00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.981
There will be
singing and dancing

229
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:33.701
and lots of barley sprit
and delicious food.

230
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:36.411
And there's this
massive fire that

231
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:37.825
you have to see it
to believe it.

232
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:40.620
but you can see it from all the
way across the valley.

233
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.872
You foolishly snuck into my room
to invite me to this?

234
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.093
I don't know what I
was thinking.

235
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.093
I'm sorry to bother you.

236
00:23:58.771 --> 00:23:59.771
This dress okay?

237
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:03.858
Yes.

238
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.236
Now lose the blade.

239
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:10.657
Okay.

240
00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:13.774
Okay. as in you'll come?

241
00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:16.902
How do you expect to
get us out of

242
00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:18.620
here without my
father seeing us?

243
00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:35.740
Mother. father. this
is myroslava.

244
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:37.779
Myroslava. this is my mother.
rada.

245
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.367
Pleased to meet you.

246
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.781
And you.

247
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:42.245
You're very welcomed here.

248
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.204
Thank you.

249
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:46.325
And this is my father. zakhar.

250
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:48.201
Very pleased to meet you.

251
00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.828
Your son saved my life earlier.

252
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.332
Well then we have three things
to thank the gods for.

253
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:55.208
Maksim's heroics.

254
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.132
the food we feast on.
and your life.

255
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.005
She killed the bear.

256
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.019
And this is uncle
korhun right here.

257
00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:06.022
It is a pleasure.

258
00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:10.729
She's very beautiful.

259
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:14.649
Yes. she is very beautiful.
uncle korhun.

260
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.442
Just like you. yes.

261
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.236
Why don't you get some
more honey spirit?

262
00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.243
Yes. honey spirit!

263
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.868
My brother's around
here somewhere.

264
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.831
Do you have siblings?

265
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:27.835
T wish I did.

266
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.036
Oh. there he is.

267
00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:35.291
I remember seeing him at
the bear hunt.

268
00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:37.509
He's rough to me at times
but he means well.

269
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:40.380
I don't know what I would do
without him. to be honest.

270
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:47.098
This reminds me of a
party my father

271
00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:49.313
threw for my mother
when I was little.

272
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:52.353
Everyone was singing
and dancing.

273
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:54.773
My parents must have
danced all night.

274
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.943
My mother had this white gown on
and a flower in her hair.

275
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.985
What happened to her?

276
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:06.989
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.206
No. no. it's all right.

278
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.919
I didn't mean to make
anything uncomfortable.

279
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:12.922
And did you?

280
00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:15.174
Did I what?

281
00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.468
Learn to dance?

282
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:22.223
Come on.

283
00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.831
Are you enjoying the evening?

284
00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:50.835
Very much.

285
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:09.889
Be kind to my boy.

286
00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:31.205
It's beautiful.

287
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.201
Those are gifts to our guardian.

288
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:37.455
The sentinel rock. see?

289
00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:40.966
It's actually a giant that
protects our valley.

290
00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:43.085
A giant?

291
00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:44.961
That's what the legend says.

292
00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.973
Well. long ago.

293
00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:52.219
when kind and wise giants
roamed this land.

294
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:55.018
the evil goddess of death.
morana. cursed it.

295
00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:57.683
She made everything in
the water die

296
00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:00.231
and the whole area around it
completely lifeless.

297
00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:04.815
No animals. no trees.

298
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:07.033
just bare rocks.

299
00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:09.028
And the mighty king of giants.
saw this.

300
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.121
and he took his huge mallet

301
00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:13.456
and he dealt the rocky
basin a massive blow

302
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.076
that cracked its walls and
broke the evil spell.

303
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:20.918
And the whole area came
alive at once.

304
00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.133
Needless to say.
morana was furious.

305
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.463
And she let out this
piercing scream

306
00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:29.510
and turned the king of
giants into stone.

307
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.227
But. no matter how hard she
tried or what she did.

308
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:35.641
she could never reverse all the

309
00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:37.310
beautiful life that
had blossomed.

310
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:42.186
And that's why my ancestors
chose to live here.

311
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:46.902
Ti can envision it.

312
00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:51.403
And if morana should
ever return.

313
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.364
well. the king will awake
from his slumber

314
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.662
and protect us from her evil
wraith once again.

315
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.871
You have so much love
for this place.

316
00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:03.301
I can see why.

317
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:12.678
I have to get back.

318
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:57.428
You can eat for days.

319
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:58.929
Eat the bread before
it goes stale.

320
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.020
T will.

321
00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:01.481
It was good to see you.
uncle korhun.

322
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.396
Safe travels back to
your village.

323
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.768
Good luck with your sister.

324
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.863
You know how she likes to talk
during these journeys.

325
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.822
I heard that.

326
00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:13.284
Don't worry. I have plenty
of honey spirit

327
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:14.994
to soothe my ears.

328
00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:17.330
Good. to see all of you!

329
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:22.161
Oosta. have you seen Maksim?

330
00:31:22.172 --> 00:31:24.413
Here he comes now.

331
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:34.347
Mother. I'm sorry that I'm late.

332
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:35.966
I take it you had a good night.

333
00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:40.220
Buchon. say goodbye
to your mother.

334
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:43.891
Goodbye my love.

335
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.063
Send along my greetings.

336
00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:54.825
Take care of your brother.

337
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.037
I will.

338
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.155
Travel safe.

339
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:02.751
I'll see you soon.

340
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:06.507
Goodbye.

341
00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:11.387
Yeah?

342
00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.306
What. what?

343
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.636
Oh yeah. yeah. hunt.

344
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:20.260
Yeah. yes. yes. yes we'll go.

345
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:21.762
We'll go.

346
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.311
Yeah.

347
00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.697
No. I'm not hungry.

348
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.041
No. he's busy.

349
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.262
Yes. he was busy
entertaining a new lady.

350
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:56.265
Whoa.

351
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:27.669
There's nothing there.

352
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.672
Come on.

353
00:33:36.473 --> 00:33:37.337
Oosta. oosta!

354
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:38.179
Stop!

355
00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:39.514
What are you doing? Stop!

356
00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:41.258
It's me. Maksim.

357
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:43.134
It's all right.

358
00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:43.931
Maksim.

359
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:44.803
Yeah. it's me.

360
00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.270
It's all right.

361
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:47.810
You're all right.

362
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.932
You're safe.

363
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:49.944
What happened?

364
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.030
Demons.

365
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.443
Demons on horses.

366
00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:58.112
What do you mean demons?

367
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.108
What happened to the others?

368
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.486
When we arrived to
korhun's village.

369
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.623
they burnt it to the ground.

370
00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:06.708
There's nothing left.

371
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:09.544
I barely escaped and I didn't
see what happened

372
00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:12.005
to your mother or rosana.

373
00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.008
I'm sorry.

374
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.715
Do you think you can make it
back to tukhlia?

375
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:20.597
Go.

376
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.512
Find our father. tell him what
you told us. understand?

377
00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:25.639
Go.

378
00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:26.602
Now.

379
00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:27.606
Go.

380
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.197
Uncle korhun!

381
00:35:24.205 --> 00:35:25.205
Tvan!

382
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.792
Your mother.

383
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:35.799
Rosana.

384
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:38.052
They took-

385
00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:39.845
who. who took them?

386
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.377
No. there's no time to
bury the bodies.

387
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:19.378
The gods will understand.

388
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:47.285
What are we waiting for?

389
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:48.698
Be patient.

390
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.914
There are two guards
patrolling the perimeter.

391
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:52.202
We'll go in from the east.

392
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:54.795
Blades only.

393
00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:01.299
Quickly and quietly.

394
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:22.403
Go on. take your pick.

395
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:24.860
Who's gonna die?

396
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:25.868
You? Me?

397
00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:28.405
Me next. huh?

398
00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:29.323
Me next!

399
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.330
Don't be scared!

400
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.076
Have you died before?

401
00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:36.542
You only get to do it
once or twice.

402
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:41.256
It's you. it's you.

403
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.840
Oh. you beat me.

404
00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:44.425
You won. you won.

405
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.010
Well done. nice one.

406
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:49.055
Come on. little man.

407
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.639
Hurry up. let's go.

408
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.430
Leave them alone!

409
00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:58.648
Rosanna. protect the others.

410
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:01.184
Nol!

411
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:02.106
Rada!

412
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.819
Stop. please. please!

413
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:07.194
We didn't do anything. stop!

414
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:14.955
Maksim. you go after mother.

415
00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:18.793
Petro and I will get rosana
and the others.

416
00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:19.797
Go.

417
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.192
Come here.

418
00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:24.152
Come.

419
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:41.368
Oi. I'll give you a challenge.
huh?

420
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.462
I wanna tell you something.

421
00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.385
Huh. do you like a challenge?

422
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:53.880
All you mongrels have
tried to kill me

423
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:55.348
and you've all failed.

424
00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:56.761
You could be the one.

425
00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:57.929
You could be lucky.

426
00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:05.899
Shh. shh. shh.

427
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:06.984
Hurry. Petro.

428
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.774
Come on. take a challenge!

429
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:09.861
Kill me first!

430
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:10.866
Kill me!

431
00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:12.857
Do it now!

432
00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:17.829
Come on!

433
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:22.625
It's weak to kill a woman first!

434
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:23.414
It's weak!

435
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:24.376
Be a man. huh!

436
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.540
Be a man!

437
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:28.631
Go with Petro and get
them all to safety.

438
00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:30.045
Go.

439
00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:34.087
Take it!

440
00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.098
Go on!

441
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:41.396
Mother.

442
00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.979
Oh. me too.

443
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:46.816
Get me out of this. come on.
Oh. sorry.

444
00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:47.774
Come on. get me.

445
00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:49.986
Oi. here. oi here. here!

446
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:50.989
Come on!

447
00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:54.861
Oh no!

448
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:07.586
Mother.

449
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:17.426
Mother. are you all right?

450
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.673
You need to get the others.

451
00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:19.925
Come on!

452
00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:21.426
Petro.

453
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.098
You took your time. come on.

454
00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.106
Shut up!

455
00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.025
Go!

456
00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:54.842
Let me see.

457
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:55.926
Nol!

458
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.921
We don't have any time.
we need to go.

459
00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.012
Take mother back the
way we came.

460
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:00.348
I'll buy you some time.

461
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.351
Go.

462
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.806
Meet us in the caves.

463
00:42:03.813 --> 00:42:05.769
Go. I'm with you.

464
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.151
We're almost there.

465
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.445
Keep going.

466
00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:25.290
Go meet up with my family. I'll
be right behind you.

467
00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:44.186
Hey!

468
00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:45.937
Let's go!

469
00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:31.018
What are you doing?

470
00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:32.856
I'm gonna get me some mongols.

471
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.191
What do you mean you get
you some mongols?

472
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:35.275
There's too many of them.
that's suicide.

473
00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.816
Ti don't care.

474
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:42.783
This is unfinished business.

475
00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:44.698
If you go out there. you
compromise everyone in this cave.

476
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.411
And why should that stop me?

477
00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.415
Please.

478
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:50.912
Maksim. hurry. it's your mother.

479
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920
Come.

480
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:09.890
Remember. family above all else.

481
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400
Maksim.

482
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:19.695
What happened?

483
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.032
I can't stop the bleeding.

484
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:09.694
Heal the trees.

485
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.281
so that they can cry for you.

486
00:49:17.913 --> 00:49:21.622
Let our great mother. mokash.

487
00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:25.211
bring heavy rain.

488
00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:28.461
so she can cry for you as well.

489
00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:33.918
Watch over the soul of rada.

490
00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:35.214
as she leaves this world

491
00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:39.966
and goes to the next. where
greater gods await.

492
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:56.542
Merke.

493
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:28.574
I know you all are concerned

494
00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:29.826
about your lives and your land.

495
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.714
but we have gathered to resolve
our dispute with tugar volk

496
00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:37.925
and unite with him and his army

497
00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:40.510
to stand strong
against the mongols.

498
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.300
He will not show.

499
00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:43.593
I told you.

500
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:45.057
He thinks he's above us.

501
00:51:46.353 --> 00:51:47.468
What do we do now?

502
00:51:55.988 --> 00:52:00.948
Have faith old one. look.

503
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.388
Do you smell that?

504
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.596
The stench of pagan swine.

505
00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:48.154
People of tukhlia.

506
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.706
I have come here today.

507
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:53.795
not

508
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.753
because you called me.

509
00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.210
I have come here.

510
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.838
on my own accord.

511
00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.962
Nevertheless. we
appreciate your arrival.

512
00:53:11.814 --> 00:53:14.430
I'd say. it's good to see you.
zakhar.

513
00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:18.650
but we both know that it
would be a lie.

514
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:21.733
Yes. it would be.

515
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.322
Look here. this is the deed

516
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.942
that appoints me your leader.

517
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.660
your boyar of all these lands!

518
00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:33.248
Do you believe that parchment
makes us respect you?

519
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:35.997
You are forcing us into an

520
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:37.835
agreement that we had no say in!

521
00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:40.960
Do you not think
it's wrong that.

522
00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:43.300
without asking your permission.

523
00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:47.091
I take that sword of yours and
give it to my sons?

524
00:53:50.686 --> 00:53:53.428
The mongol army is
bearing down on us.

525
00:53:57.401 --> 00:54:00.893
I'm here. to protect your people

526
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:05.314
in a way that you could not
protect your own wife.

527
00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:11.949
I'll leave you to your own fate

528
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.869
and to the mongol hordes.

529
00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:15.741
Ah!

530
00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:17.118
Let the gods decide!

531
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:22.967
If you win.

532
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:25.671
you can stay in tukhlia

533
00:54:27.014 --> 00:54:28.470
and we will follow your rule.

534
00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:34.719
You'll follow my rule.

535
00:54:35.689 --> 00:54:36.689
But also.

536
00:54:38.984 --> 00:54:40.224
your sons.

537
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.942
your sons will serve
in my house.

538
00:54:51.205 --> 00:54:53.196
But when we win.

539
00:54:53.207 --> 00:54:55.664
you will go to gallich to
gather your men

540
00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:59.456
to fight shoulder to
shoulder with us

541
00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.499
against the mongols. as equals.

542
00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:03.841
Agreed?

543
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:18.648
Agreed.

544
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:20.441
Gard!

545
00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.771
Father. I know you want
to choose Ivan.

546
00:55:27.783 --> 00:55:28.783
but please pick me.

547
00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.586
Are you sure about this?

548
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:51.882
Let the gods decide.

549
00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:18.905
Stay low.

550
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.953
Use his size against him.

551
00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:16.238
It's settled then.

552
00:58:20.998 --> 00:58:23.159
Nothing is settled.

553
00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:29.120
I have spilled blood
throughout these lands

554
00:58:29.131 --> 00:58:30.131
in over 20 battles.

555
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:36.085
And you think I am going to
honor a commoner's agreement?

556
00:58:41.893 --> 00:58:46.762
The warrior I once knew would
not dare to lose his honor.

557
00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:49.018
Are you a liar?

558
00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:51.646
And a coward?

559
00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:56.021
The warrior that I once knew

560
00:58:57.451 --> 00:59:00.033
wouldn't be scratching
the dirt and shit

561
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:01.243
like some farmer!

562
00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:05.493
I'll bring your army
from gallich.

563
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:09.993
and we will fight
shoulder to shoulder.

564
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.838
If you still can. old man.

565
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:18.471
Get up!

566
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:22.850
Thank you.

567
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:29.146
Gather supplies!

568
00:59:29.149 --> 00:59:32.266
And you'll not thieve
from all my men!

569
00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.019
It wasn't as impressive as
defeating a bear

570
00:59:36.031 --> 00:59:37.692
but you didn't have my help. so.

571
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:42.151
You've been here the
entire time.

572
00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:45.120
Yes.

573
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:46.909
I heard about your mother.

574
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.710
I'm so sorry.

575
00:59:52.047 --> 00:59:54.914
I'm grateful you got
to meet her.

576
00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:59.171
Your mother was like mine.

577
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.179
Kind.

578
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:02.473
and sweet.

579
01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:07.596
Bring me my horse!

580
01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.808
I should go before my
father sees me.

581
01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:18.062
But I will see you soon.

582
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:28.475
Merke.

583
01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.924
I love to come peace.

584
01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.227
Today.

585
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:17.723
You are peace.

586
01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.486
Who owns this?

587
01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:25.731
I swear. I've never seen it.

588
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.742
Don't hurt him!

589
01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.254
Why are you doing this?

590
01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.814
Tugar volk.

591
01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.007
What happened?

592
01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.007
The mongols have taken tugar
volk and myroslava.

593
01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.554
They're resisting. but they
don't have long.

594
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.176
How many?

595
01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.019
About 20. maybe less.

596
01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:21.433
Myroslava.

597
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.726
Get your brother and go.

598
01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:39.364
Where is everyone?

599
01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.284
They were here when I left.

600
01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:43.375
They must be inside.

601
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:03.493
Myro-

602
01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.536
how you could tell him

603
01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.984
that the necklace
belonged to Maksim?

604
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:10.417
Those fools killed
the Khan's son.

605
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.426
I give him what he wants
and we survive.

606
01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.841
Maksim and his family
are your people!

607
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.427
How can you betray
them like this?

608
01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:28.815
I give him one family. I
save thousands.

609
01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.558
That's what a true leader does!

610
01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.231
You promised to fight
alongside the villages.

611
01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:39.451
Be the one who unites us
against the mongols!

612
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.707
You fight.

613
01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.451
You are a foolish girl.

614
01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:54.378
You have no idea of the
sacrifice that I have made.

615
01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.468
You talk of uniting
these people.

616
01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.383
they know nothing of that!

617
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:00.390
Your mother.

618
01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.887
she never understood it-

619
01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:07.308
my mother sacrificed everything

620
01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.521
for the people she loved!

621
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:14.446
And where were you?

622
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.364
You're a coward.

623
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:29.765
Tvan!

624
01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.887
There's too many!

625
01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.685
Go to the house!

626
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.775
Inside. quickly. quickly!

627
01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.394
To the house!

628
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:39.406
Go. go. go!

629
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.955
Bohun. stop!

630
01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:57.922
It's Ivan!

631
01:08:57.925 --> 01:08:58.960
Find cover!

632
01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:04.088
Maksim. get yourself
to the windows!

633
01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:08.057
At least we got comfortable
benches to die on then.

634
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:36.374
Ha! Hal

635
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.934
Someone's coming!

636
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.698
Listen to me!

637
01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.161
You are warriors!

638
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:15.862
And you've proven yourselves!

639
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:21.747
But you have taken the life of
the Khan's only son!

640
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.210
He will never stop.

641
01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:29.302
until you're dead!

642
01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.176
Sacrifice yourselves.

643
01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.139
and you will save your families.

644
01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:42.315
I beg you.

645
01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.776
This is futile.

646
01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.486
And I swear to you.

647
01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.905
I will protect the
people of tukhlia.

648
01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.205
Well meet your death. traitor!

649
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.166
Burn it.

650
01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.635
They're gonna smoke us out.

651
01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.826
Hey. hey the wind is
in our favor.

652
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.368
We use the smoke as cover and we
attack them straight on.

653
01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:43.999
Maksim's right.

654
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:45.921
Get ready.

655
01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:53.398
What are you doing?

656
01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:54.316
You're one of us!

657
01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.939
I am not one of you. peasants.

658
01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:37.547
Stop!

659
01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.666
That's enough!

660
01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.927
Paul. you and your men
are tukhlian.

661
01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:45.389
Fight beside us.

662
01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:56.402
Maksim.

663
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.990
Maksim!

664
01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:03.857
Hi.

665
01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:05.075
Are you hurt?

666
01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.413
Hey!

667
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.420
Your ax.

668
01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.379
Come on then.

669
01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.140
Maksim. no!

670
01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:36.688
Release!

671
01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:01.963
Halt!

672
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:01.731
My child.

673
01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:24.834
Tugar volk is allies
with the mongols.

674
01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.078
They won't be far behind.

675
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.006
Tvan!

676
01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:31.295
Bring him into the house!

677
01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.656
He's been struck by some
kind of poison.

678
01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:13.421
Rosanna. bochan.

679
01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.886
Petro. rosanna. bochan. go.
go go!

680
01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.861
I'm so sorry. my son.

681
01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.947
It's all right. father.

682
01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:39.322
The gods welcome me.

683
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.792
It's been an honor.
little brother.

684
01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.043
Live your life.

685
01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:04.476
It's your time.

686
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.231
What happened?

687
01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:15.198
Tvan.

688
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:17.950
No. no.

689
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.031
It's all right. my love.

690
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.571
It's all right.

691
01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.949
I'm here.

692
01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:29.538
I'm not leaving.

693
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:31.881
I promise.

694
01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:36.254
I will see you again.

695
01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:41.221
in the next world.

696
01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.018
Bochan.

697
01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:55.519
Don't cry. my son.

698
01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:57.949
Don't cry.

699
01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:01.744
Be strong.

700
01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.744
Protect your mother
and our family.

701
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.632
Nothing is more important.

702
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.720
It's all right.

703
01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:31.145
I'll always be
watching over you.

704
01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:21.904
Maksim. Maksim!

705
01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:22.772
How?

706
01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:23.819
How can you live
your entire life

707
01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:25.818
and not know what your
father truly is?

708
01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.862
How am I supposed to trust you?

709
01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.459
Years ago. there was
a man who came

710
01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.250
to our house in gallich.

711
01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:42.047
He scared my father in a way.
I'd never seen before.

712
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.466
I couldn't understand it at
the time. but today.

713
01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.089
when I smelt his horrid
stench in my home.

714
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.100
I knew.

715
01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.467
I knew it was him.

716
01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:52.938
Murunda Khan.

717
01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.939
Our mothers deserve more.

718
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.107
My brother would have wanted
you to have this.

719
01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.397
He was a man of honor.

720
01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:42.315
Listen. I don't want
what happened

721
01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.608
to my family to happen to yours.

722
01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:45.822
You've done enough.

723
01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.532
Your family needs you.

724
01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.616
Go home.

725
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.620
Home?

726
01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:52.412
I don't have a home.

727
01:26:54.334 --> 01:26:55.790
My beautiful wife

728
01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.873
and my seven year old daughter.

729
01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.213
are already dining
with the gods.

730
01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:05.967
So before I join my family.

731
01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.760
I will make this right.

732
01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:17.771
We will make this right.

733
01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:28.528
My dear fellow villagers

734
01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:29.991
and respected neighbors.

735
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:32.986
there is very little time.

736
01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.748
Our scouts have
confirmed that the

737
01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.539
entire mongol army
rides towards us.

738
01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:43.918
They will not stop
until they have

739
01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.007
murdered every last one of us.

740
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:48.627
They outnumber us by
the thousands!

741
01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:49.638
We have to run!

742
01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:52.718
This is the only way
we can survivel

743
01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:55.467
even if we left right now.

744
01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.561
their horses would
catch up to us.

745
01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:58.564
And then what?

746
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.147
I have a possible solution.

747
01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:03.778
We can take everything

748
01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:09.072
and leave tukhlia through the
back side of the mountain.

749
01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:11.441
And once we have all
passed through.

750
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.906
we will tear down the
sentinel rock.

751
01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.085
break the dam.

752
01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:25.001
and create a river barrier
between us and the mongols.

753
01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.542
And how will we
create enough time?

754
01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.793
They're already too close.

755
01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:33.756
A group of us will
hold them off.

756
01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:39.804
The entrance to
tukhlia is narrow.

757
01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:43.524
If we gather all of our fighters
at this main point.

758
01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:45.893
we can hold off the
entire mongol army

759
01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:48.737
and make time for the rest
of you to escape.

760
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740
Now you must choose!

761
01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:54.780
Abandon the person next to you
and save only yourself

762
01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:59.031
or do we unite as one and
protect each other

763
01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:01.749
and fight for
something meaningful!

764
01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:07.964
We fight!

765
01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:12.928
We fight!

766
01:29:13.765 --> 01:29:14.765
We fight!

767
01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:21.645
We fight!

768
01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:31.794
I never did thank you.

769
01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:34.011
For what?

770
01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.760
Saving my life.

771
01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:39.058
The second time.

772
01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.094
I don't believe you thanked
me for the first.

773
01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:46.982
That's true.

774
01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:49.944
Thank you.

775
01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.618
Myro. from the moment I
first saw you...

776
01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:38.041
It's simple.

777
01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:39.088
We go this way.

778
01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.095
Oh!

779
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:41.930
Yes!

780
01:32:44.934 --> 01:32:45.934
Our great guardian.

781
01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:51.271
you. whom our ancestors regarded
your sent protector.

782
01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:55.642
break once more
morana's evil power.

783
01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.647
Destroy with your great way.

784
01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:02.444
this vicious enemy.

785
01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:08.117
The mongols will
arrive at mid-day.

786
01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:48.953
It is a privilege to
dying honorably!

787
01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:52.699
And if we are to die today.

788
01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:54.200
we die like warriors!

789
01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.754
I would gladly die for you!

790
01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.965
Yes!

791
01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.209
On my command!

792
01:34:05.932 --> 01:34:06.932
Pull!

793
01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:36.538
Form your lines!

794
01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.065
Loose!

795
01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:46.832
We can't hold 'em off
much longer!

796
01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.583
I'll make sure everyone in
tukhlia is gone!

797
01:36:48.594 --> 01:36:49.594
Good. go!

798
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.090
Bohun.

799
01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:40.679
Bohun! Ah. did we win yet?

800
01:39:40.683 --> 01:39:42.173
I thought you were dead.

801
01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:47.145
You didn't think those little
mongols could have hurt me?

802
01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:08.180
We're ready.

803
01:41:08.187 --> 01:41:09.472
Tell the others.

804
01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.266
We'll prepare the dam.

805
01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:26.364
The last villager has
just left tukhlia!

806
01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:28.158
We are ready!

807
01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:29.165
Maksim!

808
01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:31.661
Go!

809
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.221
Ya-yal!

810
01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:18.002
Take her. go.

811
01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:19.007
Go.

812
01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:21.092
Please. go!

813
01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:52.892
Destroy the dam.

814
01:43:57.022 --> 01:43:59.604
All right. gather
yourselves boys.

815
01:43:59.608 --> 01:44:00.608
For Maksim!

816
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:46.070
Merke.

817
01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:46.756
Pull!

818
01:45:56.308 --> 01:46:01.302
Pull!

819
01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:38.391
Pull!

820
01:47:18.599 --> 01:47:19.805
I'll be back.

821
01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:28.843
Hey!

822
01:51:32.769 --> 01:51:33.769
Hiya! Go!

823
01:52:00.923 --> 01:52:01.923
Come!

824
01:53:10.158 --> 01:53:11.318
You did this!

825
01:53:25.007 --> 01:53:27.339
Zakhar. you want safe passage.

826
01:53:29.886 --> 01:53:31.626
I will spare your son.

827
01:53:44.276 --> 01:53:47.439
Myroslava. hand me your bow.

828
01:54:02.627 --> 01:54:06.290
Kill him!

829
01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:38.764
Nol!

830
01:58:01.825 --> 01:58:02.825
Father!

831
01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:08.153
Father.

832
01:58:08.164 --> 01:58:09.164
Son.

833
01:58:10.458 --> 01:58:11.823
I knew you would make it.

834
01:58:11.835 --> 01:58:13.496
Save your breath.

835
01:58:13.503 --> 01:58:15.118
Our people are safe.

836
01:58:17.716 --> 01:58:20.924
Your mother would be so
proud of you.

837
01:58:28.852 --> 01:58:29.967
I am. as well.

838
01:58:34.733 --> 01:58:35.733
Myroslava.

839
01:58:38.862 --> 01:58:40.352
look after my son.

840
01:59:07.432 --> 01:59:10.515
Mother and Ivan are
waiting for you.
