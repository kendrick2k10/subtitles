3
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.120
‐ Well...womp‐womp.

4
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.800
‐ Hey. come on.

5
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.400
Stop it.

6
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.440
‐ I can't.

7
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
I‐I can't.

8
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.760
LUCY:
I just wanted it to be natural.

9
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.240
‐ It will be natural.
Just let me call him.

10
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.280
Look. he's one of the top five
fertility specialists

11
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.200
in the world.

12
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.400
‐ As a woman.
this is the one thing

13
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.880
I'm supposed to be able to do.
and I can't do it.

14
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.120
‐ Well. let's just find out
if we can get pregnant.

15
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520
And if we can't. then. you know.
we'll blow the college fund

16
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.840
on some of the best vacations
of our lives.

17
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.360
Call him.

18
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.360
ADRIAN:
Really?

19
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.520
Oh.

20
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.680
Oh.

21
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.320
You're gonna love him.

22
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.840
ADRIAN:
Wow.

23
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.040
‐ Hello.
ADRIAN: Hi.

24
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.400
LUCY: Hi.
‐ You must be Lucia and Adrian.

25
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.840
‐ Yes.
‐ Um. I go by Lucy. but...

26
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.160
‐ Can we get a name change
from "Lucia" to "Lucy." please?

27
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.440
‐ Oh.

28
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.480
‐ I'm Dr. Hindle's
head nurse. Dawn.

29
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.360
Let me just get you started
with some paperless paperwork.

30
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.680
And Rita...

31
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.520
can help out with refreshments.

32
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.560
‐ Do you want a. uh.
espresso or something?

33
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.320
‐ Sure.

34
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.760
‐ Enjoy it while you can.

35
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.280
‐ Go ahead.
Take a seat.

36
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.280
‐ I'm changing
the file name now.

37
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.480
LUCY:
Thank you.

38
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.720
ADRIAN: Here.
Rita recommended that for you.

39
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
‐ Mmm.

40
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.880
‐ Gonna be good.

41
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.480
Adrian.

42
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.520
ADRIAN: Hey.

43
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.920
‐ So nice to see you.

44
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.560
‐ Yeah. it's been a long time.
hasn't it?

45
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.640
‐ Yes. it has indeed.
Hello. Lucy.

46
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.280
‐ Hi.
JOHN: Lovely to meet you.

47
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.360
‐ Such a pleasure to meet you.

48
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.080
‐ So...you two need
a little help.

49
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.200
‐ Uh. y‐yeah.
‐ Yeah.

50
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.240
We've been trying pretty hard
for two years.

51
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.600
‐ Yes. I know.
Adrian told me.

52
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.200
LUCY:
I don't get it.

53
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.440
I...thought I have been
doing everything right.

54
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.560
I eat well.
I exercise.

55
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.920
I haven't even had a drink
for two years.

56
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.280
‐ I don't want you
to have to question

57
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280
everything you're doing.

58
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.400
I will give you
the best possible chance

59
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.360
of getting pregnant.

60
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.920
How does that sound?

61
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.320
‐ That sounds great.

62
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.400
JOHN:
Good.

63
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.840
Oh. thank you. Dawn.

64
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.040
‐ Hm.

65
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.560
‐ Did you know that Adrian

66
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.160
was the most talented surgeon
I ever taught?

67
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.480
‐ Oh. God.
Stop it.

68
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.200
JOHN:
There was this one woman.

69
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.080
she had breast cancer.
and the hospital wouldn't pay

70
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.720
for a post‐mastectomy
augmentation.

71
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.440
So your husband.

72
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
he just goes and does it
without telling anyone.

73
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.200
‐ Well. I‐I told her.

74
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.240
JOHN: Yes. and the board wanted
me to let you go.

75
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.600
I told them. "If he goes. I go."

76
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.720
I was sick of teaching at
the hospital anyway. so I quit.

77
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.360
We should've started our own
practice right then and there.

78
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.080
‐ Yeah. Would've been great.
Lot of work. though.

79
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.400
JOHN:
Mm. I know it's hard.

80
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.880
Sometimes I wish
I could clone myself.

81
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.320
It's the only way
I'd get the job done.

82
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.600
Okay.

83
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.880
Your architecture is great.
‐ Oh.

84
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.600
‐ Problem is low hCG levels.

85
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.240
We'll give you a little boost
post‐ and pre‐insemination.

86
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240
monitor your numbers from there.

87
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.680
‐ That's it?

88
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.640
‐ Yes.

89
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.040
‐ Really?

90
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.600
I've just been tested
so many times.

91
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.040
‐ All these women‐‐

92
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.720
All these women here
had troubles.

93
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.200
Some‐‐ Some worse than you.

94
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.120
All happy mums I've sent home
with babies.

95
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.080
We have IUI and IVF.

96
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.160
IVF makes babies in a test tube.

97
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.840
IUI makes them inside of you.

98
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.640
I've invented a method
that's a little of both.

99
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.400
I like to call it. um.
in utero Hindle fertilization.

100
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.120
You can help me with that one.

101
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.360
as you're the marketing genius.

102
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.880
Okay.

103
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.000
‐ Oh.
Well. then. thank you. John.

104
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.680
JOHN: It's a pleasure.
‐ Yeah.

105
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.440
‐ Thank you so much. Dr. Hindle.
Thank you.

106
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.000
‐ Luce? Got five?

107
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.600
Dirk's considering making you
lead on the Wyth account.

108
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.640
‐ Oh. my God!

109
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.360
Are you serious?
‐ Yes!

110
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.240
Mihail's managing four clients.

111
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.000
I've got six. and I was like.
"What about Lucy?"

112
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.800
‐ Greg. you said that?

113
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.640
Thank you so much.

114
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.440
‐ Of course.

115
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.560
He wants to see Bryon's ideas
before pulling the trigger.

116
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.840
‐ Of course.

117
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.280
‐ But you're what this pitch
needs.

118
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.480
Some female intuition.

119
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.880
Although I like to think I cover
a little of that myself.

120
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.680
Now. if this works out.

121
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.640
it's gonna come
with more responsibility.

122
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.120
Travel. more money.

123
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.640
Luce. I'm fighting for you.

124
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.440
Also...I'm thinking
Dig In for lunch.

125
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.480
What do you think?

126
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.080
‐ I'm obsessed with Dig In.

127
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.520
I'll start an order.
‐ Great.

128
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.160
I'm gonna do the. uh.
grilled tofu market bowl

129
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.800
and a side
of wilted beet greens.

130
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.760
‐ Yum. I'm gonna do the same.
‐ Mm.

131
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.240
‐ Is there anything else
I can do for you?

132
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.160
‐ No.
Uh...thank you.

133
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280
‐ Okay.

134
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.440
ADRIAN:

135
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.160
‐ Lucy. would you like to watch?

136
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.000
‐ Oh. No.
DAWN: Here you go.

137
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.400
‐ Perfect.

138
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.680
Okay.

139
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.360
JOHN:
Okay.

140
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.200
‐ Mm.
DAWN: Rita.

141
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.600
‐ Good work. son.

142
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.240
This is powerful stuff.

143
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.400
Mm.

144
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200
Oh.

145
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.880
Brilliant.

146
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.920
Hmm.

147
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.760
ADRIAN:

148
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.680
MIHAIL:
She looks like a smart shopper.

149
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.160
BRYON: Why are you fighting me
on this?

150
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.320
MIHAIL: Okay. Luce.
what do you think of her?

151
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.440
She's kind of too runway.

152
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.560
I think of Wyth as more
"girl on the subway" hot.

153
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.040
MIHAIL: Thank you.
That's what I said.

154
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.080
We need subway hot. not runway.

155
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.840
BRYON:
Subway hot?

156
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.800
Okay.
What about this one?

157
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.120
‐ Um...

158
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.520
I'll be back in a second.

159
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.440
You are...

160
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.680
100% pregnant.

161
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.080
Oh. my God!

162
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.640
Oh. thank you. Doctor.

163
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.120
Oh. my God.
‐

164
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.920
Oh. my God. Thank you.

165
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.240
Thank you. Dr. Hindle.

166
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.880
‐ Come on. Stop it.

167
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.000
I'm almost done.

168
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.400
‐ Alright.

169
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.440
You go.

170
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.320
‐ After all that?
‐ Yes.

171
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.360
Okay. Fine.

172
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.880
If we have a girl...

173
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.280
ADRIAN:
Mm‐hmm.

174
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.400
‐ ...Wendy.

175
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.440
‐ Oh. Luce.

176
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.040
That's perfect.

177
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.160
‐ We can make Wendy
a little Peter Pan costume.

178
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.480
in honor of your mom.

179
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.720
‐ That would be nice.
ADRIAN: Mm.

180
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.080
Okay.

181
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.520
I'm only gonna do boys' names
from now on.

182
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.840
‐ Okay.

183
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.280
‐ What about...

184
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.680
Adrian?

185
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.240
‐ As in Junior?

186
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.120
‐ Kind of cool. right?

187
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.240
Hey.

188
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.000
Um. I will take orders
in just a couple minutes. um.

189
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.760
but I wanted to talk to you
about something.

190
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.520
‐ Sure.

191
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.560
Are you. uh. feeling nervous
about the pitch?

192
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.640
‐ Actually. I wanted
to let you know that I...

193
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.720
am pregnant.

194
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.640
GREG:
I knew it!

195
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.160
I seriously have some sort

196
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.920
of women's‐intuition thing
going on.

197
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.840
GREG: You have been glowing!

198
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.640
‐ Oh. Thank you.

199
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.400
‐ Alright.
What's up?

200
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.800
‐ Oh.
GREG: Tell him.

201
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.160
Go on. tell him.

202
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.680
‐ Okay.

203
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.120
I'm pregnant.

204
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.920
‐ Yes!
‐ Aww!

205
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.160
No wonder you've been glowing.

206
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.680
‐ That's what I just said!

207
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.560
‐ I literally said that
to my wife last night.

208
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.800
I was like. "Lucy is glowing."

209
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.720
‐ You guys. thank you.
That's so sweet.

210
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.080
‐ Hey. let's get
a really good lunch today.

211
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.440
Whatever you want.
Even better than Dig In.

212
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.800
‐ What about Wyth?

213
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.040
‐ You know.
it might not be a bad idea

214
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.680
to let them know
you're expecting.

215
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.600
Make them feel bad
if they don't hire us.

216
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.840
‐ Yeah. and. I mean.
if you're not showing by then.

217
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.520
we'll just plump you up
with a pillow.

218
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.120
‐ Yeah.
Wyth has really nice pillows.

219
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.680
GREG: That's right.

220
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.160
‐ Mm‐hmm.
Thank you. Dawn.

221
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.440
Oh.
Wonderful. wonderful.

222
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.400
Hm.

223
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.720
Right.
Here we go.

224
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.400
‐ Oh. my God.

225
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.680
Is that a...

226
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.040
‐ Yep.

227
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.800
JOHN:
And there's the second.

228
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.600
Twin set.

229
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.880
Males.

230
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.720
We have twin boys!

231
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.840
DAWN: Twins.
‐

232
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.280
‐ And...the third.

233
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.840
Female singlet.

234
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.160
‐ Wow.

235
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.120
JOHN:
Just relax.

236
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.480
DAWN: Just relax.
Water. please.

237
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.400
‐ Relax.

238
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.400
This is absolutely normal

239
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.520
for how aggressive we boosted
your numbers.

240
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.040
I was not gonna send you home
empty‐handed.

241
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.640
So. we've got twin boys
and a female singlet.

242
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.000
total of three.

243
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.360
Now...

244
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.480
selective reduction.

245
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.520
Far be it from me
to tell you what to do.

246
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.800
but with your history
and these elevated numbers.

247
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.040
we're looking at an increase
of possible complications.

248
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.520
‐ Preemies or.
worse. miscarriage.

249
00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.600
‐ By reduction. uh. you mean...

250
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.240
an abortion?

251
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.160
We'd be making a sacrifice
to ensure a successful birth.

252
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.640
Either the boys. because they
share the same sac. or the girl.

253
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.440
Now. I would strongly recommend
we keep the boys.

254
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.520
They look healthy.
And the girl?

255
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.760
Well. she's a bit small.

256
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.400
‐ Um...

257
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.000
C‐‐ Uh...

258
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.200
Could we...

259
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.400
Like. is there‐‐

260
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.840
‐ It's okay.
‐ Sorry.

261
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.120
I‐I just don't want to make
the wrong choice.

262
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.040
‐ Lucy. Lucy. Lucy.

263
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.080
I will not let that happen.

264
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.760
‐ Yeah.

265
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.240
‐ The odds of you having a baby
have just increased 100%.

266
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.000
But yes.

267
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.680
You do have a decision to make.

268
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.920
‐ Thank you.

269
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.520
JOHN:
Adrian. can I have a word?

270
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.800
‐ Okay.

271
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.320
DAWN:
I know. sweetie.

272
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.160
It's a lot to think about.

273
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.560
‐ Yeah.
Thanks.

274
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.760
WAITER: I heard we have
a celebration this evening.

275
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.680
‐ We did it.

276
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.920
‐ I'm pregnant.

277
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.640
‐ Yes. we're pregnant.

278
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.880
Come on.

279
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.280
It's expensive.

280
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.480
Do you want to talk about it?

281
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.760
‐ I'm still processing
the whole thing.

282
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.440
Aren't you?

283
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.120
ADRIAN:
Yeah.

284
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.840
But I agree with Dr. Hindle.

285
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.640
I think we should have the boys.

286
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.720
‐ You do?

287
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.240
‐ You said you've always wanted
a sibling.

288
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.800
You know. a lot of your quirks
are from being an only child.

289
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.920
Uh...

290
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.840
‐ Two at once is a lot.

291
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.800
‐ Look.

292
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.120
What do you think
the chances are

293
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.640
of us being able
to get pregnant again?

294
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.080
ADRIAN:
Slim.

295
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.880
I‐I'm saying that for myself.

296
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.560
'cause I'm getting
up there. too.

297
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.200
‐ What about Wyth?

298
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.120
‐ I'll just take on more clients
if you want to quit work.

299
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.640
‐ I don't want to stop working.
I'm just starting to get ahead.

300
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.560
‐ Babe. we've always talked
about having more than one.

301
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.280
‐ Yeah. that was before
we couldn't have any.

302
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.880
‐ Yeah. which is why I'm saying
that we should have‐‐

303
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.680
You asked me my opinion.
so I gave it to you.

304
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.000
‐ I want the girl.

305
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.440
I've always seen her.

306
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:14.160
pictured us lying together
in bed. staring at each other.

307
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:20.120
And she would see through me
with these clear eyes.

308
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.680
right past me to some
better version of myself.

309
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.720
‐ Come here.

310
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.840
ADRIAN: I hear everything
that you're saying.

311
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.040
I just don't want you to regret
your decision.

312
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.360
‐ Are you serious?

313
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.840
‐ Would you like to hear
this evening's specials?

314
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.400
‐ Uh. yes.
That would be great.

315
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.080
‐ Tonight we have
a pan‐roasted duck.

316
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.000
It is in a persimmon glaze

317
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
served with a side of roasted
local root vegetables.

318
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
We also have a homemade
tagliatelle pasta

319
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.760
with black‐pepper cream sauce
with foraged mushrooms on top.

320
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.800
I'm sorry
if I made you feel bad.

321
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.520
‐ It's okay.

322
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.120
‐ Let's have Wendy.

323
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.560
It's what you want.

324
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.600
‐ Are you sure?

325
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.720
‐ I mean. if you are.

326
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.440
‐ Oh.

327
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.440
Thank you. I love you.

328
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.680
‐ I love you. too.

329
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360
‐ What?

330
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.480
‐ John wants me to present him
with some big award.

331
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.280
Probably just wants to embarrass
me with a story or whatever.

332
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280
but...

333
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.840
‐ Well. you have to do it.

334
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.600
That's some real exposure.

335
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.720
‐ Yeah. then I have to write
a speech. then I have to‐‐

336
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.160
‐ I'll write it for you.
Duh.

337
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.320
‐ Are you serious?

338
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.560
LUCY:
Of course.

339
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.080
He got us pregnant.

340
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.480
You owe him.

341
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.560
‐ Yeah.
LUCY:

342
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.920
‐ Well. can't argue with that.

343
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.280
‐ Lucy. you're not gonna be
doing this on your own.

344
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.760
You should join a mommy group
or something.

345
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.920
‐ That's a great idea.
‐ Yeah.

346
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.760
‐ I wish one of my friends
was pregnant.

347
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.600
You know. Eden doesn't even have
that boyfriend anymore.

348
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.720
and Alyson is like‐‐

349
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.200
‐ Alyson's Alyson.

350
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.120
Come on.

351
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.600
You know you love them.

352
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.720
They're just‐‐

353
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.600
‐ Loud?

354
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.000
‐ I was gonna say young.
but they are also loud.

355
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.680
‐ Mm.

356
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.480
‐ So then I got into
part‐time food styling.

357
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.280
I was just like. "Fuck it."

358
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.880
‐ That's awesome.
‐ Good for you.

359
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.600
‐ Yeah.
‐ That's great.

360
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.680
Um. well. I'm Corgan.

361
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.560
Uh. I'm a paralegal.

362
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.280
and I'm 17 weeks pregnant
with Rafe.

363
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.040
like "Ralph" but French.

364
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.720
‐ Oh. Cute.

365
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.600
‐ My husband. Brad. is a lawyer
at Goldman. in house.

366
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.720
Um. and we're just so excited.

367
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.640
We did a bunch of rounds of IVF.

368
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.360
and. you know.
third time's the charm.

369
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.000
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

370
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.280
‐ We tried two times.
and this one finally stuck.

371
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.640
‐ Good. good.

372
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.920
‐ I kind of went
a little off the deep end.

373
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.080
‐ Mommy brain is a real thing.

374
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.880
‐ Oh. girl.

375
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.360
‐ We did IVF. too.

376
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.680
‐ Oh.
Who'd you go to?

377
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.360
‐ The Hindle Women's Center.

378
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.440
‐ Oh. my God.

379
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.520
I was on a wait list there
for a year and a half

380
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.680
before we gave up.

381
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.320
‐ Oh. Wow.

382
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.440
‐ Can I ask how long
you had to wait?

383
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.920
‐ Um. I actually didn't

384
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.040
because my husband. uh. was
his student in medical school.

385
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.280
‐ Oh. my God. How lucky.
WOMAN: Wow.

386
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.080
‐ Well. what kind of doctor
is he?

387
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.640
‐ Adrian is a reconstructive
surgeon at Sloan Kettering.

388
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.640
‐ Uh. does he do
mommy makeovers?

389
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.320
‐ Yeah.

390
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.040
‐ Can you get. like.
a Hindle C‐section

391
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.680
and a tummy tuck
all in one shot?

392
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.240
‐ I never thought about that.
but I'm gonna ask him.

393
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.600
‐ I would really like
to get in on that plan. right?

394
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.400
‐ Uh. yeah.
‐ Can we get a family discount?

395
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.800
‐ Yeah. But you're so tiny.
you probably won't even need it.

396
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.840
‐ Oh.
WOMAN: You are gonna be huge!

397
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.520
‐ Thank you.

398
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.280
ADRIAN: Lucy.

399
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.800
Are you ready?

400
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.680
‐ Yeah.

401
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.080
‐ There's no need
to be worried. Lucy.

402
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.720
I've done this procedure
thousands of times

403
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.400
over the past 30 years.

404
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.200
‐ Dr. Hindle is an innovator
in the field.

405
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.600
You are with truly the best
in the biz.

406
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.200
I swear I didn't tell her
to say that.

407
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.440
You are in good...

408
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.120
and hopefully warm hands.

409
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.200
LUCY:

410
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.240
JOHN:
Okay.

411
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.520
You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

412
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.080
Just breathe deeply.

413
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.400
JOHN:
Very good.

414
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.320
Breathe.

415
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.120
JOHN:
Deeply.

416
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.800
In through your nose.

417
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.000
And out through your mouth.

418
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.040
Breathe.

419
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.480
JOHN:
I've perfected the technique.

420
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.160
ADRIAN:
Do you think she can hear us?

421
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.480
JOHN: No. no. no. no.
She's out cold.

422
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.880
She'll get
her fairy‐tale ending.

423
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.720
LUCY:
Wendy.

424
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.320
Wendy. it's time to go.
sweetheart.

425
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.040
ADRIAN:
Hey.

426
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.920
‐ You zonked out on us.

427
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.640
How are you feeling?

428
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.200
Okay. I guess.

429
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.000
ADRIAN:
Well. you can just rest up now.

430
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.360
JOHN: Lucy. I want you to think
of this as a fresh start.

431
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.480
Okay?

432
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.560
‐ Okay.
JOHN: Good.

433
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.640
Oh. Dawn.

434
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.320
‐ Okay. sweetie.

435
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.920
You might not want to tell
anyone about this.

436
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.080
You know.
there's so much judgment

437
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.280
and misinformation out there.

438
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.920
‐ Yes. You feel free
to call us any time.

439
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.080
Visit any time you wish.

440
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.120
‐ What happens to...the twins?

441
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.680
‐ What do you mean?

442
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.600
‐ The. um...reductions.

443
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.760
JOHN: Reduced fetuses
attach to the placenta

444
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.560
and get extracted
with the afterbirth.

445
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.640
‐ So they won't affect Wendy?

446
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.120
JOHN: No.
No. no. no.

447
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.080
She's all taken care of.

448
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.440
‐ Thank you so much. Doctor.

449
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.440
JOHN: Oh.
Let's have a hug. shall we?

450
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.360
There we go.

451
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.760
Mm!

452
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.720
You rest now.
Adrian?

453
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.600
‐ Thanks. man.
JOHN: Yes.

454
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.040
Good man.
Good man.

455
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.840
And when is she gonna start
calling me John?

456
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.280
‐ Well. that's up to‐‐
‐ Oh.

457
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.040
‐ Thank you. John.
JOHN: Bye. now.

458
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.840
‐ Try to enjoy
some quality mom time.

459
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.680
You deserve it.

460
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.360
Remember. you're pregnant.

461
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.840
‐ You know. I...

462
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.000
thought I heard these weird
things during the reduction.

463
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.720
you and Hindle talking about...

464
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.280
I don't know.

465
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.720
ADRIAN:
Really?

466
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.680
Must've been dreaming.

467
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.280
Right up here. Mohammad.
Thank you.

468
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.000
‐ Yeah.

469
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.720
Yeah.

470
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.600
JOHN: The Internet is full
of misinformation.

471
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.520
I don't want you
getting paranoid.

472
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:24.480
What you have is called OHSS‐‐
ovarian hyperstimulation.

473
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.880
Actually. it's a good thing.

474
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.520
Your uterus is making room.
so it stretches.

475
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.800
sometimes a little too thin.
and it bleeds.

476
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.680
‐ So you're not concerned?

477
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.240
‐ No.

478
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.520
Now. there'll be
no more googling.

479
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.720
Understood?

480
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.120
LUCY: The choices Wyth have made
are subtle but powerful.

481
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.640
elevating yourselves in
a marketplace full of basics.

482
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.360
We here at Liegler want to
re‐fashion your consumers.

483
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.680
your "fans." as co‐creators.

484
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.440
GREG:
You fucking killed it!

485
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.440
‐ I did. didn't I?

486
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.440
‐ I've known Coraline
for decades.

487
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.600
started a crew together.
and she's a. um...

488
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.800
How do I say it?

489
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.200
MIHAIL:
Let's say. uh. tepid.

490
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.160
‐ Exactly.
For her to say. "I like it"?

491
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.640
Wow!
GREG: No. no. no. no.

492
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.800
She said. "I like it very much."

493
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.560
and that it was very smart.

494
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.840
BRYON: That's a big compliment
coming from a...

495
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.080
let's say genius.

496
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.360
ADRIAN:

497
00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.200
‐ I didn't even
hear you come in.

498
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.080
Okay.
Guess what.

499
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.560
‐ What?

500
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.360
‐ I nailed the pitch. and
I get to lead the Wyth account.

501
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.680
‐ That's amazing.

502
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.680
LUCY: Am I gonna be one
of those women who has it all?

503
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.600
My career. my kids.
my old man by my side?

504
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.520
‐ Who you calling old?

505
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.240
‐ Whoo!

506
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.360
Oh. my God.
That's so scary.

507
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.000
‐ Apparently. umbilical cords

508
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.640
are supposed to have
two arteries.

509
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.000
and mine only has one.
because of course it does.

510
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.040
‐ I'm so sorry.

511
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.520
‐ Half the babies born with this

512
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.720
have all sorts
of awful complications.

513
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.680
I mean. horrible things
like deformities.

514
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.840
‐ Oh. God.
CORGAN: I just can't‐‐

515
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.520
I just...

516
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.720
Dr. Davis says I essentially
have to be on bed rest

517
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.920
from here on out. which...

518
00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.760
I guess is okay.
'cause I can quit now

519
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.760
and not have to waddle into work
for the next five months.

520
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.880
‐ You're‐‐ You're gonna quit?

521
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.360
‐ Oh. Brad and I decided.

522
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.760
I mean. if something happened
to baby Rafe

523
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.840
and I hadn't done
everything that I could.

524
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.640
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

525
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.200
‐ Maybe you could do
a little work from home.

526
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.120
‐ Oh. please.
I'm so ready to check out.

527
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.240
‐ At least you won't have to
figure out where to pump.

528
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.120
‐ Right?
Like. "Oh. excuse me. guys.

529
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.440
I'm just gonna go pump
in the broom closet real quick.

530
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.520
Pump on the toilet."

531
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.600
‐ I'm actually gonna pump
on the subway

532
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.640
'cause it's less awkward
than at work.

533
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.720
Oh. thank you
for making me laugh.

534
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.920
Do you have your notes?

535
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.160
‐ Yes.

536
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.800
Thank you. by the way.

537
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.520
‐ Use them.
Don't read them.

538
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.760
‐ Yes.
I know. I know.

539
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.920
‐ Just get that centered.

540
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320
‐ Did you hear that?

541
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.320
‐ Yeah.

542
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.440
I'm gonna take a look.

543
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.440
Nothing.

544
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.760
‐ Oh.

545
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.480
‐ What can you say about a man

546
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.040
who has fundamentally
changed fertility?

547
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.880
The truth is.
you can't really say enough.

548
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.760
Not in words.

549
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.040
But you can see it.

550
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.320
You can see it in the eyes
of a mother

551
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.200
looking at her newborn
for the first time.

552
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.200
seeing her purpose. her destiny.

553
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.200
You can see it in the giddiness
and that nervous energy

554
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.160
of new parents
bringing their baby home.

555
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.480
full of wonder and awe.

556
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.120
I'm filled with
an enormous warmth tonight.

557
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.480
being with John's peers.
of course.

558
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.400
and honoring him
for the fifth time in a row.

559
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.520
Dr. John Hindle.

560
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.000
‐ Good evening. ladies and
gentlemen and honored guests.

561
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.160
Basic science.

562
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.360
The fundamental foundation
of our economic. social.

563
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.520
and environmental progress
is under attack.

564
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.120
‐ Hi. Mama.

565
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.480
‐ Hey. Daddy.

566
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.280
‐ I got you something.

567
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.480
‐ Adrian.

568
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.440
We are nowhere near
being able to celebrate yet.

569
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.760
I don't want to jinx it. mister.

570
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.240
‐ I'm celebrating...

571
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.840
because we've been through
so much already.

572
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.480
‐

573
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.040
ADRIAN:
It's different this time.

574
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.400
‐ Adrian.

575
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.920
‐ You deserve it.

576
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.280
‐ These are difficult times.
challenging times.

577
00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.040
But there is no greater reward
than to see a young mother

578
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.800
who has toiled with
a burning desire to give life

579
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.880
and who now lies before me
with her infant on her breast.

580
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.520
spent with exhaustion
and euphoria of birth.

581
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.280
to look into that child's eyes

582
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.040
and to know that I've been part
of their existence in this life.

583
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.920
That is the true gift
of my work.

584
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.440
‐ I'd like to put it on you.

585
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.840
‐ Okay.

586
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.440
It is...very beautiful.

587
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.440
Honestly. thank you so much.

588
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.600
JOHN:
We are building a generation.

589
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.000
progressing families.

590
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.760
and giving mothers
their fairy‐tale ending.

591
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.480
It's why I'm here.

592
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.040
Tonight...and always.

593
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.000
On behalf of all the families

594
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.160
whose lives I am now
forever part of...

595
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.360
I humbly accept this award.

596
00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.560
‐ Does your doctor claim
to know more about your body

597
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.560
than you do?

598
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.040
That your body is high‐risk?

599
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.720
ADRIAN: Hey! Whoa. Hey.
LUCY:

600
00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.160
‐ Relax.

601
00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.360
What are you doing?
‐ I th‐‐

602
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.680
I thought I‐I heard someone.

603
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.040
‐ Oh.

604
00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.840
It's alright.
Come here.

605
00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.480
‐ Shh. shh. shh. shh. shh.

606
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.280
‐ We managed to get
a second opinion.

607
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.800
and we're feeling so much better
about Rafe and everything.

608
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.880
‐ Are you serious?
CORGAN: Yeah.

609
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.080
‐ That's such a relief.
CORGAN: It is.

610
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.000
‐ Oh. I'm so happy to hear that.

611
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.720
‐ How are you?

612
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.120
‐ I'm good.

613
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.560
I'm okay.

614
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.080
‐ Are you?

615
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.640
‐ I‐I just‐‐
I'm starting to feel nervous.

616
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.080
‐ Oh.

617
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.520
‐ A little...crazy.
I‐I'm seeing things.

618
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.440
‐ Honey. me too.

619
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.840
I'm having the wildest
mommy brain lately.

620
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.640
I don't‐‐
I don't think it's mommy brain.

621
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.240
Something's...not right
with Wendy.

622
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.440
‐ What do you mean?
Did Dr. Hindle say something?

623
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.920
‐ No.
I‐I‐I think Dr. Hindle...

624
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.720
did something to Wendy.

625
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.280
‐ Lucy.

626
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.280
No.
I mean. that's‐‐

627
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.840
You're just...

628
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.280
This is a lot.

629
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.680
Have you talked to Adrian
about how you're feeling?

630
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.480
I really think‐‐
‐ No. I think Adrian's in on it.

631
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.440
‐ In on what?

632
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.920
‐ That's why I'm‐‐ I'm thinking
of using this midwife instead.

633
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.920
CORGAN:
Lucy.

634
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.400
This is not like Rafe.

635
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.600
Unless something
is really wrong.

636
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.800
you should not be making
sweeping changes

637
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800
to your birth plan.

638
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.080
‐ Yeah.

639
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.520
‐ Hey.

640
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.160
This pregnancy shit is no joke.

641
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.320
Right?
‐ Yeah.

642
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.440
CORGAN:
Okay. it's really scary.

643
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.040
But you are not alone.

644
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.840
‐ Thank you. Corgan.

645
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.400
‐ I'm gonna hop on the bike.

646
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.240
If you want to pass out
before I come back in.

647
00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.000
I'll be quiet
when I come back in.

648
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.240
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

649
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.520
Unless you want me to stay.

650
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.600
‐ No. no.
Enjoy.

651
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.240
‐ Alright.

652
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.400
‐ Does your doctor claim
to know more about your body

653
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.320
than you do?

654
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.600
That your body is high‐risk?

655
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.360
Do you feel disenfranchised

656
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.280
by what swirls around us
regarding motherhood.

657
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.880
trying to get pregnant. work.
your birth plan?

658
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.120
Feeling connected
to your changing body.

659
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.320
longing for
a deeper experience?

660
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.080
Hi.

661
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.040
I'm Grace Singleton.

662
00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.640
And I believe
that women are gifted

663
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.520
with the highest‐potential
purpose for humankind.

664
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.920
I became a midwife because
I wanted women to connect

665
00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.240
with this planet's most powerful

666
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.120
and phenomenal instrument‐‐
their bodies.

667
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.160
We have a spiritual current
that flows through us.

668
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.800
We are vessels
for a cosmic feat.

669
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.680
That privilege makes women the
strongest people on the earth.

670
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.440
Modern gynecology stands
on the shoulders of men

671
00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.560
who thought the womb
was an unruly creature

672
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.680
inside a woman's body.

673
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.480
Doctors said labor was traumatic

674
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.760
and that we needed
to be subdued.

675
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.560
Suddenly. we can't handle
the pain as our ancestors did.

676
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.280
billions of women before us.

677
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.840
as if birth was broken

678
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.720
before these men came up
with the solutions.

679
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:08.400
They fear. loathe.
and covet that power.

680
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.440
and always under
the guise of concern.

681
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.520
We've been robbed
of experiencing

682
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.320
the richness of this process
in all its messy.

683
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.640
complex. awesome entirety.

684
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.800
Letting them make
the decisions for us‐‐

685
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.800
That's what I call high‐risk.

686
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.240
Lucy. how do you feel right now?

687
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.640
‐ I feel like
my head is spinning.

688
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.160
‐ Confront whatever it is
that's blocking you from you.

689
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.160
Let it out.

690
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.520
From your gut.

691
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.880
GRACE:
Go.

692
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.920
Go. Lucy.

693
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.240
Let it out.

694
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.280
GRACE: Remember how
you're feeling right now.

695
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.400
Empowered.

696
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.200
Free.

697
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.360
ADRIAN:
Lucy.

698
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.280
You alright?

699
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.880
‐ Yeah.

700
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.240
‐ I thought I heard you scream.

701
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.640
‐ I‐I...

702
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.000
I must've been dreaming.

703
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.760
‐ Okay.
Um...

704
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.600
Well...time to turn off
your iPad.

705
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.680
Go to bed. you millennial.

706
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.760
GRACE:
Well. most pregnant people

707
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.720
have had medicalized entry
into care.

708
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.440
especially if you've
had IVF or IUI.

709
00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.640
Pregnant people are not ill.

710
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.320
They're pregnant.

711
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.040
GREG: How is that even within
the realm of possibility?

712
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.800
Thank you.

713
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.160
Well. we sent the portfolio
two‐‐ over two months ago.

714
00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.200
Yes.

715
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.120
DAWN:
Lucy.

716
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
LUCY:
Dawn.

717
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.920
What are you doing here?

718
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.640
‐ I came to get the magazine.

719
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.880
With Dr. Hindle on the cover.

720
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.360
‐ Oh.

721
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.680
‐ Well. he's been working for‐‐

722
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.800
oh. for 30 years
to get on that cover.

723
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.800
and he doesn't appreciate
you taking it.

724
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.560
‐ I was only borrowing it.

725
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.680
I'll bring it back.

726
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.640
‐ Oh.
Mommy brain.

727
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.320
‐ Totally fine.
‐

728
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.200
LUCY: Really? You don't need
to s‐see her or...

729
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.520
‐ Nope.
Responding normally.

730
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.880
Reflexes. heartbeat.

731
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.000
You'd be surprised
at how resilient they are.

732
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.040
It was very good
that you came in. Lucy.

733
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.520
‐ There you go.

734
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.760
I'm really sorry
about the magazine.

735
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.040
JOHN: Mm.
Well. I'm sorry about Dawn.

736
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.480
She's very loyal
and proud of my work.

737
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.040
Dawn has worked for me
for the past 18 years

738
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.400
and fiercely defends her family.

739
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.560
‐ Mm. I'm so embarrassed.

740
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.600
I really only meant
to borrow it.

741
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.800
‐ Oh. I know that.

742
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.720
Yes. there's a lot of voodoo
out there.

743
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.480
We just want to make sure that
you get the best possible care.

744
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.920
‐ Thank you. John.
for seeing us so last‐minute.

745
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.040
‐ Oh.

746
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.800
ADRIAN:
Thank you. buddy.

747
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.160
JOHN:
Yes.

748
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.840
‐ Okay.

749
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.240
‐ Have a good night. hon.

750
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.680
LUCY:
So?

751
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.280
GREG:
So...

752
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.200
after talking
to Mihail and Dirk...

753
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.640
we worry about losing momentum.

754
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.160
We think Bryon should lead
on the Wyth account.

755
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.360
‐ Really?

756
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.000
‐ You're gonna need time.

757
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.160
It's a marathon.

758
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.400
Luce. you don't want this to be
your first one out of the gate.

759
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.760
‐ Are you using m‐my deck.
my ideas?

760
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.200
‐ They loved you at Wyth.

761
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.320
We love you at Liegler. Lucy.

762
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.120
Come on.
Don't take this the wrong way.

763
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.720
We just want to make sure
things go smoothly.

764
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.520
‐ I think I'm gonna need
at least a three‐month buffer.

765
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.880
Yeah.
Well. she's gonna need me.

766
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.360
Huge change. yeah.

767
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.920
J‐‐ Hey. you know what?

768
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.400
Uh. c‐‐ can I call‐‐
can I call you right back?

769
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.680
Thanks. Bye.

770
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.520
You okay?

771
00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.320
‐ No.

772
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.080
‐ Well. what's going on?

773
00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.440
LUCY: They're using my deck
and my ideas.

774
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.280
I got the Wyth account. and now
I'm not allowed to work on it.

775
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.200
It's okay. it's okay.

776
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.360
I just had to get
out of there and come see you.

777
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.600
I got you something.

778
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.480
ADRIAN: Lucy‐‐
‐ It's really. really good.

779
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.240
We got it at work the other day.

780
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.240
I can't believe
we haven't had it yet.

781
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.720
‐ What the hell's going on?

782
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.240
‐ What?

783
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.600
I can't bring my husband lunch?

784
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.360
‐ You just brought me lunch.

785
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.040
‐ Mommy brain
is a real thing. Lucy.

786
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:53.120
Prepartum depression hits
about one out of five women.

787
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.440
‐ Listen to Dr. Hindle.

788
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.720
You should be enjoying
this process.

789
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.920
‐ We now know that Xanax is safe
at .25 milligrams

790
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.600
starting the third trimester.

791
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.080
‐ This won't affect Wendy?

792
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.240
‐ Wendy?

793
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.800
Mm. no.
No. no.

794
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.520
Try and take care
of yourself. Lucy. hmm?

795
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.840
Can you do that for me?

796
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.480
DAWN:
Smile. Lucy.

797
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.000
It actually makes you happier.

798
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.720
It's scientifically proven.

799
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.080
JOHN:
There you go now.

800
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.400
‐ Lucia Martin?

801
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.680
LUCY:
Yes.

802
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.880
Oh. my gosh.

803
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.840
I can't believe
I'm actually meeting you.

804
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:07.120
I'm a really big fan
of your words and your videos.

805
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.800
Your whole thing inspires me.

806
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.280
‐ It is highly unusual
for me to take on a client

807
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.160
this late in the process.

808
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.040
But you seem vulnerable.

809
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.720
This time should feel special
and exciting.

810
00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.080
not a constant uphill battle.

811
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.280
You have a lot to unpack.

812
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.240
‐ My mom died a few years ago.

813
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.800
And I've been hoping that.
with Wendy.

814
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.320
I might get a piece of her back.

815
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.720
But maybe it's wrong to put
that kind of pressure on her.

816
00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:02.560
‐ See yourself with Wendy.
loving her. nurturing her.

817
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.080
Laughing with her.

818
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:13.000
Giving her all the strength you
have been given. have earned.

819
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.480
And look at her.

820
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.040
Strong little lady.

821
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.800
ADRIAN:
Hey. How you doing?

822
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.520
RITA: You're all set.
Room 1992.

823
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.840
ADRIAN:
Thank you very much.

824
01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.600
JOHN: Hi.
ADRIAN: John.

825
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.040
Ohh.

826
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.760
RITA:
Room 1992.

827
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.440
‐ I found this in Adrian's safe.

828
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.680
‐ What is this?

829
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.480
‐ Read this.
Do you see that?

830
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.400
I‐I‐I'm part of a study?

831
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.080
What study?
I‐I didn't sign up.

832
01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.880
Do you see that?
An injection.

833
01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.280
Of what?

834
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.800
Look at‐‐ Look at this.

835
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.040
Look at these photos of me.

836
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.920
I‐I know they did
something to Wendy.

837
01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.520
I've known it the whole time.

838
01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.040
‐ This is crazy.

839
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.320
‐ I am not crazy.

840
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.440
They're trying to make me
think I'm crazy.

841
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.880
‐ Can I take this
and show this to Brad?

842
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.280
‐ Why?

843
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.560
‐ To get a lawyer's perspective.

844
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.920
I mean. he's gonna need
to see this for himself.

845
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.760
He'll know your rights.

846
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.080
‐ Right. Okay.

847
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.360
Thank you.

848
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.480
‐ Just until we know
what this is.

849
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.440
you have to act like
everything is normal.

850
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.480
‐ Hey!

851
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.760
Hey. look at me.

852
01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.120
You okay?
What did you do?

853
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.360
I swallowed water.

854
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.920
‐ There's no shame in it.

855
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.160
‐ Morning.

856
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.120
‐ What's happening?

857
01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.520
I'm gonna quit.

858
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.000
‐ Eating?
‐

859
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.480
My job.

860
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.440
Everything.
Even Dr. Hindle.

861
01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.240
‐ You're joking.

862
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.120
‐ No. I‐I want to see
Grace Singleton.

863
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.920
‐ Sorry. Who?

864
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.680
‐ She's this midwife I found.
and I saw her yesterday.

865
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.560
and. Adrian. she was magical.

866
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.880
She was just...amazing.

867
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.560
She's just more natural.

868
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.160
Hindle and them. they feel so...

869
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.760
Ugh. like...

870
01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.600
Yeah.

871
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.600
ARDIAN: Look. Luce. we've been
seeing him for months.

872
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.040
I've known John for years.

873
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.240
He‐‐ He's the one
that got us pregnant.

874
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.680
‐ He got me pregnant. Adrian.

875
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.080
I don't know. I'm just
more comfortable with Grace.

876
01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.240
Dr. Hindle gives me
a bad feeling.

877
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.240
‐ So you're basing this all
on a fucking feeling?

878
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.120
And what am I
supposed to tell John?

879
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.400
‐ I don't know.

880
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.800
He's your friend.

881
01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.920
‐ No.

882
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.320
No.
No. no. no.

883
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.000
I‐I‐I have to draw
the line somewhere.

884
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.200
‐ Well. not around
my birth story.

885
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.000
‐ Your birth story?

886
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.720
So. what. you saw a post.
and now you're‐‐

887
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.120
you're basing
our entire baby's life

888
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.200
on a fucking Instagram trend?

889
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.560
Let's not forget. this is my
baby we're talking about. too.

890
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.280
‐ Um. I invited Eden and Alyson
to the shower.

891
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.680
It's gonna be really fun.

892
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.480
Mmm.
‐ Oh.

893
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.680
‐ This is delicious.
‐ So that's it?

894
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.840
‐ Yeah.

895
01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.120
Do you want some?

896
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.520
‐ Did you send the sonogram
over to Grace?

897
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.120
ADRIAN:
Yeah. I told you.

898
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.360
John is really mad
and disappointed.

899
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.200
‐ Oh. my gosh.

900
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.200
‐ Oh! Oh. my gosh.
‐ Take it.

901
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.720
‐ That is gorgeous.

902
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.680
‐ To Lucia from me.

903
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.640
‐ Oh. thank you.

904
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.040
What is this?

905
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.120
‐ It's a first‐edition copy
of Peter Pan.

906
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.120
It's the same one
that your mom read to you.

907
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.400
I just wanted to do a little
something besides the shower.

908
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.040
‐ Thank you.

909
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.360
CORGAN:
Luce?

910
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.080
‐ Earth to Lucy!

911
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.800
‐ How did you know
my name's Lucia?

912
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.000
‐ What?

913
01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.400
‐ I'm sorry.

914
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.920
‐ Is it baby brain
or is it mommy brain. right?

915
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.800
CORGAN:
Lucy. are you okay?

916
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.200
Hey.

917
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.680
Is‐‐ Is everything alright?

918
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.240
‐ You go to John.

919
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.600
‐ What?

920
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.560
‐ You go to John.

921
01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.040
‐ I've had three miscarriages
and tried IVF three times. Lucy.

922
01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.200
I didn't have a choice.

923
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.480
‐ When did you go?

924
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.200
‐ We were really worried
about you.

925
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.320
and‐‐ and when I told Adrian
about my complications.

926
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.920
he got me in.

927
01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.560
‐ After everything I told you.
you went to Adrian?

928
01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.360
CORGAN:
You were scaring me.

929
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.120
You were obsessing. and‐‐
and you seemed really not well.

930
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.360
I just thought that
your husband should know.

931
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.640
‐ Wait.

932
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.440
You gave him the file.

933
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.120
That was my proof. Corgan.

934
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.000
‐ Lucy...

935
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.920
Adrian said there is
no safe in his office.

936
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.280
‐ Oh. my God.

937
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.440
GRACE:
Push!

938
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.160
Push!

939
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.160
Push!

940
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.040
Push!
‐

941
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.640
GRACE: Here she comes!

942
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.240
Here she comes. here she comes.
here she comes.

943
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.080
It's a boy.

944
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.000
It's a boy.

945
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Oh. Oh.

946
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.600
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

947
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.880
Oh. my God.

948
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.080
Oh. my God.
You're crowning again.

949
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.000
Okay.

950
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.040
‐ Oh. God.

951
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.240
Oh. God.

952
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.520
I'm having the twins!

953
01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.440
‐ You need to go to the ER
right now.

954
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.160
She's experiencing
a full placental abruption.

955
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160
You need to go.

956
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.680
Now!

957
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.320
‐ You're doing great. baby.
‐ Doing great. Lucy.

958
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.440
Just push now.
Push.

959
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.840
Push. Lucy. push.
ADRIAN: You're doing great.

960
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.040
It's amazing.
You're doing just amazing.

961
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.560
JOHN:
It's coming. It's coming.

962
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.760
The baby's head is crowning
right now.

963
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.640
Push.
‐

964
01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.080
JOHN: And here he is.
Our second baby boy.

965
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.760
ADRIAN: This is hard. and it's
difficult to understand.

966
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.560
but we will work
through this together.

967
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.680
But these are ours. and it is a
critical time to create a bond.

968
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.400
You know. we have
been through...a lot.

969
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.040
And...

970
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.720
this is not. um...

971
01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.280
You've been through a lot.
Luce...

972
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.840
these last couple days. and...

973
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.800
It's overwhelming.

974
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.560
It's overwhelming.

975
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.880
I know it seems hard right now.

976
01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.520
But this is a good thing.

977
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.920
Wait till you see
how special these boys are.

978
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.760
Such beautiful blue eyes.

979
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.520
LUCY:

980
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.120
I can't believe
this happened to me.

981
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.680
‐ I know. I know.

982
01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.240
It's crazy.

983
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.600
‐ What happened to your office?

984
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.040
Wasn't it more culturally. uh...

985
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.000
Weren't there. like...

986
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.920
masks and‐‐

987
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.160
Even your outfit
looks...different.

988
01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.640
‐ No.

989
01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.320
Nothing has changed.

990
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.360
‐ Really?

991
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.520
‐ Mm.

992
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.640
I am not your mystical
Negress. Lucy.

993
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.800
I'm sorry.

994
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.880
Fuck.

995
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.160
I don't even know what to do
with myself.

996
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.320
‐ Be better.

997
01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.880
‐ How?

998
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.520
‐ I don't have the answers.

999
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.400
It's not my job.

1000
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.280
It's yours.

1001
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.800
‐ I need to talk to John.

1002
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.120
‐ Do you have an appointment?

1003
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.760
‐ I need to talk to John
about reducing the wrong‐‐

1004
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.240
‐ This way.

1005
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:20.240
You have two babies
and a wonderful husband.

1006
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.440
If I were you. I would go home

1007
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.200
and spend every minute
with them...

1008
01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.000
mothering them.

1009
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.800
Just let Adrian and Hindle

1010
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.080
do the good work
they're trying to do.

1011
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.680
‐ What?

1012
01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.320
‐ Oh.
He didn't tell you?

1013
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.400
Oh. I thought you two
were closer than that.

1014
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.560
Uh. Rita. can you bring in the
Martin‐Hindle paperwork. please?

1015
01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.120
Oh.

1016
01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760
Hm.

1017
01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.640
Thank you.

1018
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.160
Mm‐hmm.

1019
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.880
Adrian's joining the practice.

1020
01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.760
Just think of all the good work
they're going to do.

1021
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.200
Welcome to the family.

1022
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.720
LUCY:

1023
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.600
JOHN:
You poor thing.

1024
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.600
What Grace did.
morally reprehensible.

1025
01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.840
And for her not to have
an affiliation with a hospital

1026
01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.280
should be illegal.

1027
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.080
‐ I just want Wendy.

1028
01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.120
Okay?

1029
01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.120
‐ This world just breaks
my heart at times.

1030
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.760
I don't know what's going on
with people these days.

1031
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.280
We've got pedophiles
running the government.

1032
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.800
terrorism in our schools.

1033
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.320
Sometimes I feel like
there's no hope.

1034
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.280
no containing the onslaught.

1035
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.080
Most people don't understand
what's best for them.

1036
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.280
They search for solutions.
but God. money. magic‐‐

1037
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.600
none of these things
can fix our problems.

1038
01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.920
None of them cure disease.

1039
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.520
Science does.

1040
01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.760
We have a saying around here.

1041
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.600
"God doesn't make babies.

1042
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.920
I do."

1043
01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.160
‐ Oh. my God.

1044
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.880
JOHN: When you and Adrian
came in here.

1045
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.560
you said you wanted a baby.

1046
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.320
I gave you
the best genes there are.

1047
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.040
My own.

1048
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.440
‐ You raped me.

1049
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.680
‐ Oh. please.

1050
01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.320
Lucy.

1051
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.240
There's no need for hysterics.

1052
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.560
LUCY:
All I wanted was a daughter.

1053
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.240
All I wanted was Wendy.

1054
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.560
JOHN:
Mm.

1055
01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.240
Yes.

1056
01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.400
Well. I'm sorry about the girl.

1057
01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.240
But these boys...

1058
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.440
these boys will spread the seed.

1059
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.120
Now. I wish I didn't have to
do this. but it's for the best.

1060
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.080
Don't worry.

1061
01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.280
It'll be painless.

1062
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.320
Ohh!

1063
01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.720
‐ I trained myself
not to have a gag reflex.

1064
01:22:44.519 --> 01:22:45.233
‐ Lucy!

1065
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.360
‐ You're gonna want to find
a new doctor.

1066
01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:30.720
MICHAEL: Wendy. I'd so like if
