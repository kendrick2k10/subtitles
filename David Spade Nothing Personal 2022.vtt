Whoo!

[inaudible]

7
00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.567
Yeah.

[crowd continues cheering]

9
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.278
Yeah.

10
00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:29.988
Nice.

11
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.074
Thank you. Minneapolis.

12
00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:33.992
Have a seat.

13
00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.202
It's good to see you.

14
00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.413
-Thank you. balcony. I appreciate it.

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.336
I appreciate you coming
and paying half price.

17
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.839
-I thank you very much. It's…
-[crowd laughing]

18
00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:51.134
Someone tried to hug me today.

19
00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.595
I mean. I sound like a dick. but

20
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.389
this older woman was very sweet.

21
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.476
and she saw me.
and we both froze. and she goes. "Oh. no."

22
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.102
-[crowd chuckling]
-"Wait a second."

23
00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.065
"No. are you someone?"

24
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.149
[scattered laughing]

25
00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.234
And I go. "Yes. I am."

26
00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.152
[crowd laughing]

27
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.571
And she goes. "Give me a hug."

28
00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.114
I go. "Oh. no."

29
00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.657
Not because I don't like it.

30
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.409
it's just I'm terrified.

31
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:17.535
You know what I mean?

32
00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.120
Who's hugging. still?

33
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.581
I go. "Oh. maybe I could
just get away with a fist bump."

34
00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:23.333
She goes. "Nope. Come here."

35
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.584
"I'm a hugger."

36
00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.544
-[David cawing]
-[crowd laughing]

37
00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.713
She did this eight-foot wingspan.

38
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.175
and she came in for the kill.
and I gave up.

39
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.677
I said. "All right. Bring it in.
Let's both die. Come on."

40
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.972
Because I don't know
what's going on. and she said… I don't…

41
00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.308
But that's how paranoid I am.

42
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:43.186
And by the way. the old "I'm a hugger."
Can we get rid of that?

43
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.771
I mean. it's not working anymore.

44
00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.523
I'm a hugger and that's it?

45
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.066
No questions asked?

46
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.983
[crowd laughing]

47
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.945
That shouldn't work anymore
for obvious reasons.

48
00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:55.156
And it definitely doesn't work with guys
for probably 100 reasons.

49
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.867
I mean. my uncle is like that.

50
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.119
"Come on. Come here!"

51
00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.162
"I'm an ass-grabber. get in here."

52
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.747
"Oh. give it a chooching ass."

53
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.249
"No. It's okay."

54
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.626
-"I'm just an ass grabber."
-[crowd laughing]

55
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:07.794
"Don't be weird about it."

56
00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.505
"No. I grab asses. and I like it."

57
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.507
"No. We understand that part."

58
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.551
"I'm an old-school guy."

59
00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.261
"It's part of my charm."

60
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.804
"I'm a camel toe grazer."

61
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.222
"And that's what I do."

62
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.141
"Just a little bit on the knuckles."

63
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.810
"I don't even feel it.
I have no nerve endings."

64
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.103
"You can't get mad."

65
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.606
"Ask my family.
I've been doing it forever."

66
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.732
[crowd laughing]

67
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:34.070
"I like to bump a biscuit now and then.
and everyone's been cool with it."

68
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.200
"I don't wanna change.
Don't be so… woke. Come on."

69
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.911
But yeah. I think that's gone.

70
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.122
But I'm from California… [chuckling]

71
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.749
…and. um. I don't know if you've heard.

72
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.586
but we're in the third year
of our two-week lockdown.

73
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.046
and it's going really badly.

74
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.673
-[scattered laughing]
-Um… [chuckling]

75
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.759
It's very tricky to have a lockdown

76
00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.137
because about six months
into it. I was like.

77
00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.891
"Any word on the two-week lockdown?
Has anyone said anything to you?"

78
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.350
"Because I'm still in my house."

79
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.561
And then our governor came out.

80
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.022
and they said he's gonna have
a press conference

81
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.107
and announce he's opening things.

82
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.110
All I want is restaurants.
That's all I. honestly. give a fuck about.

83
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.403
I said. "Great."

84
00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.738
"Let's do restaurants."

85
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.406
So he comes out on TV.

86
00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.283
waste of fucking time. 'cause he goes.

87
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.661
"Starting Monday.
we're gonna do the purple tier."

88
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.288
I'm like. "Awesome."

89
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.207
"No idea what that is. Let's go."

90
00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.710
"Starting Monday.
we're gonna open rock quarries."

91
00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.213
[crowd laughing]

92
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.299
"Archery repair shops."

93
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.425
"What did he say?"

94
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.093
"Did he say archery?"

95
00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.930
"Decoupage centers."

96
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.099
"Caterpillar sanctuaries."

97
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.101
What the fuck is going on?

98
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.186
What's happening?

99
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.982
Anything about restaurants?
"No. that's tangerine tier. that's…"

100
00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.109
"You don't know this? You don't…"

101
00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.987
"That's a year and a half away. but…"

102
00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.530
[crowd laughing]

103
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.157
Such a drag.

104
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.036
And then a few months after that.
there were some whispers of a vaccine.

105
00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.954
Remember that?

106
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.206
[whispering indistinctly] Jab. jab. jab.
[whispering]

107
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.708
Puh-fizer. Puh-fizer.
I don't know how to say it. Puh-fizer.

108
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.543
[crowd laughing]

109
00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.920
But then.

110
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.673
out of nowhere
after all this time. like a year.

111
00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.509
suddenly three vaccines
came out the same day.

112
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.511
A little suspicious. I didn't give a fuck.

113
00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.347
I'm willing to look the other way.
Jab me. Let's go eat.

114
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.892
You know what I mean. like…
a little sketchy.

115
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.686
-[crowd cheering. applauding]
-The same week.

116
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.148
I'm all in. I do not care.

117
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.608
Let's go.

118
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.777
And it was. actually.
like a horse race for a while.

119
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.654
'Cause it's like. "Here comes Pfizer."

120
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.489
"Pfizer looks
like it's gonna be out first."

121
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.826
"Oh! There's Moderna coming around
that corner. Moderna. Moder--…"

122
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.579
"Who's this? AstraZeneca
pulling up by a hair!"

123
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.747
[crowd chuckling]

124
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.916
Anyway. Pfizer wins.

125
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.961
and then Pfizer comes out.
and the guy's announcing it.

126
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.047
And they're so proud.
they're like. "We're Pfizer." [cheers]

127
00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.508
"We are 90% efficacy."

128
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.135
And I'm like. "What did you say to me?"

129
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.346
I swear to God. I thought
he was saying efficiency wrong.

130
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.390
because I went to community college.

131
00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.599
I don't know anything.

132
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.768
And I told my friend.

133
00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.812
"This idiot said it wrong
three times in a row.

134
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.731
and no one said one thing about it."

135
00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.024
[crowd laughing]

136
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:20.862
"We're 90% efficacy Pfizer.
and we have to be

137
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.239
at 45.000 degrees below zero."

138
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.283
And I'm like. "That's okay."

139
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.827
Listen. there's a few quirks
to it. that's fine.

140
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.370
Like. what does my fridge go to?

141
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.497
I don't know.
But you know what? I'll take it.

142
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.291
Next day.

143
00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:34.709
"We're Moderna."

144
00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.377
-[grunting]
-[crowd laughing]

145
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.963
"We are 95% efficacy."

146
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.173
Oh.

147
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.382
"And we're room temp."

148
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.300
Ah.

149
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.428
I'm listening.

150
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.890
Next day. "We're AstraZeneca."

151
00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.767
[humming whimsical melody]

152
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:52.977
"We're 96%."

153
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.270
"And we're a bath bomb."

154
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.980
Holy shit!

155
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:56.898
[crowd laughing]

156
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:57.857
I'm in.

157
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.693
That one sounds real easy.

158
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.445
[mouthing sound effects]

159
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.530
Fixed.

160
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.786
And then. Dr. Grouchy.
I've sorta had it with him.

161
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.537
I mean. no offense. it's

162
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.248
just buzzkill.

163
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:17.293
-[crowd cheering. applauding]
-Hammering me with bad news.

164
00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.546
No bedside manner.
Every time he sees me. it's like.

165
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.548
"What do you think?" "Gonna be worse."

166
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.510
"If I had to guess
with absolutely no information.

167
00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.011
I'd bet on worse."

168
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.889
"Everything will be bad
to worse to shitty."

169
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.350
No matter what. I'm like. "Goddamn."

170
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.352
"Any hope. dude? Let's mix it up."

171
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:35.311
"Second opinion?"

172
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.647
"No. I'm your guy. and it's bad."

173
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.942
And then. they always have
a running death count in the corner.

174
00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:42.360
which was horrifying.

175
00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:45.863
I'd block it with my hand
'cause it was such a drag.

176
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:49.325
and it was the Jerry Lewis Telethon.
We're like. "Tiffany. roll it."

177
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.910
"Oh. we hit a million!" Like…

178
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.663
That doesn't make me feel good.

179
00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:54.580
[crowd laughing]

180
00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.875
Grouchy. And he was always like.
"Oh. by the way…" he kept going.

181
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:02.213
"There's gonna be a fifth wave.
I warn ya. fifth wave."

182
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:06.134
And there was a fifth wave.
and he was jizzing on it.

183
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:09.554
He was so happy it came true.

184
00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.097
I was like. "Goddammit!"

185
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.143
He's like. "Back on TV!
Makeup. Here we go. Ring light."

186
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.394
[humming]

187
00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:17.979
[crowd laughing]

188
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.065
"Oh. it's gonna be bad. Fifth wave."

189
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.650
"It's gonna be worse than Rocky V."

190
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.318
No. it's not.

191
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.613
It's not gonna be worse than Rocky V.
What are you talking about?

192
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.992
But you do sound
like the trainer in Rocky V.

193
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:33.202
[in accent] "This one's
gonna hurt you permanent. Rock."

194
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.705
"Permanent and it's gonna
put you in a body bag."

195
00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.790
[muttering indistinctly]

196
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.584
[in normal voice] Three people know Rocky.

197
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:40.501
[crowd laughing]

198
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.586
Actually…

199
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.796
actually. when I heard. uh…

200
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.341
when I moved to Los Angeles.
I heard a rumor about Stallone

201
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.760
because. you know.
I guess last year he…

202
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.929
he was accused of some "me too" stuff.

203
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.432
And I don't know if it's true.
but that came out.

204
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.100
And then I remember when I moved to town.

205
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.352
I heard some dumb rumor about him

206
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.731
that was like.
"Oh. uh. his wiener doesn't work."

207
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.317
Wiener doesn't work. You heard me right.

208
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.986
And I go… I'm. like. at a keg party going.

209
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:08.029
"What happened?"

210
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:11.866
And they go. "Yeah. 'cause
in Rambo 3. I guess he took steroids. or…"

211
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.702
You know. which I did see.
I won't tell you what happens. but…

212
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.662
And I guess…

213
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.457
And on top of that…
Ridiculous. this is what they said.

214
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.042
"He's. uh… he's got a pump in there."

215
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.252
"Like a perfume pump
on his hip to make it go up." I go.

216
00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.422
"Is that poss--? No way."

217
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.340
[crowd laughing]

218
00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:30.426
I go. "There's no way that's true
because I'd have one."

219
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.344
[crowd laughing]

220
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:32.553
Who wouldn't?

221
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.722
Give me three.
Give me a couple of backups.

222
00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:36.349
Like. why not?

223
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:37.725
I mean. how great!

224
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.769
I just picture him at a party back then.

225
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.854
He's got some lady friend in his mansion.

226
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.066
He's like. "Hey. After this.
uh. drink. maybe we. uh.

227
00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:46.609
head up to the master bedroom."

228
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.195
[blowing rhythmically]

229
00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:50.321
[crowd laughing]

230
00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.370
What. what. what?

231
00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.497
Huh?

232
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.165
And she goes.

233
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.418
"Uh. actually I'm probably
gonna have one more drink after this."

234
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.586
He goes. "Not a problem."

235
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.005
-[exhaling slowly]
-[crowd laughing]

236
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:09.465
Dammit.

237
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.349
In fairness.
that joke is mostly sound effects.

238
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.393
It's sorta built around it.

239
00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.062
We'll cut this part out.

240
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.064
[crowd laughing]

241
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.441
[grunting]

242
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.776
[cap clattering]

243
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.071
I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

244
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.406
Ugh.

245
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.032
[crowd laughing]

246
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.158
[David laughing]

247
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.624
I actually had a big coat
to wear to Minnesota.

248
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.127
-[man] Yeah!
-[woman] Yeah!

249
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.170
-[crowd cheering]
-[David laughing]

250
00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.131
By the way. they weren't bullshitting.

251
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.091
There was a minus in front of the number.

252
00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:54.051
I was like. "There can't be."

253
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.511
[crowd laughing]

254
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.180
So I go to LA
to some hoofy doofy store. and I say.

255
00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.517
"I need a big winter coat."
And they go. "Oh. this is a great one."

256
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.562
"It's a puffer. but it's covered
in leather on the outside."

257
00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:05.730
I go. "Oh!"

258
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.649
And they go.
"A lot of rappers are buying it."

259
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.568
-I go. "Sold."
-[crowd laughing]

260
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.862
If someone else said it was cool
and they're rappers.

261
00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.363
I'm buying it. Not a problem.

262
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.408
So I go to buy it.
I put it on. and then I go.

263
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.745
"I can't wait to go skiing in this."
Then he goes. "Ayee…"

264
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.539
"I wouldn't take it skiing."

265
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.293
I go. "You wouldn't take
your winter coat in the snow?"

266
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.252
He goes…

267
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.631
"Would you take in the rain?" "No. no."

268
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.675
"I wouldn't take it in the snow.

269
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:41.057
rain. sleet. hail. flurries. drizzle.

270
00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:44.977
bluster. wind.

271
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.773
dawn. eclipse…"

272
00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:51.025
[crowd laughing]

273
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:52.318
"…twilight. or dusk."

274
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:56.364
"It's more of an indoor coat.
to be honest." I go. "Yeah. yeah. yeah."

275
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.158
"Like the living room?"
He goes. "Kitchen. Yeah. yeah."

276
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.576
[crowd chuckling]

277
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.286
"Actually. it's more
of an Instagram coat."

278
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.205
"You just sort of take it off.

279
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:05.790
take a photo.

280
00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:07.458
put it back in the closet."

281
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.878
I go. "All right.
How much is it? 90 grand? All right."

282
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:13.756
And I bought it because you know what?
I didn't wanna look stupid.

283
00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.841
[crowd laughing]

284
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.597
I was on The Bachelor this year.
uh. The Bachelor.

285
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.599
[crowd cheering. applauding]

286
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.977
Bach in Paradise.

287
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.481
Which is a little bit of the--
You know what it is. Right?

288
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.149
[crowd laughing]

289
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.068
Actually. the funniest part
was when I got there

290
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:37.113
because they…
they flew me down to Mexico and they go.

291
00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.573
"You're gonna stay in a four-star hotel."

292
00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:42.118
I didn't know it was 4 out of 1000.

293
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.119
[crowd laughing]

294
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.372
I stay in this dump. and it's… [chuckling]

295
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.791
It sounds mean. but it's a house.

296
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.044
but the stairs to my room upstairs
are outside. which is weird.

297
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.296
And I'm in there
and it's covered in crabs.

298
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.092
By the way. there's a million crabs
outside and there's 10.000 inside.

299
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:00.010
And I go. "I don't love crabs."

300
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.222
"They're kind of sickening to me.
and there's too many at once.

301
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:06.058
and I get overwhelmed
and they're fucking scary."

302
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.226
And I tell a guy.

303
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.813
"There's too many crabs."
And he goes. "It's crab season." I go…

304
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.235
"I… But not in my house.
Like. it can be out there."

305
00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:19.113
And he goes. "But they're crazy."
I go. "These aren't answers."

306
00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:21.490
"This is… Do you get what I want to do?"

307
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.660
"I don't want them here. 'cause they scare
the fuck out of me.

308
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.538
'cause I'm kinda a puss.
and they're gross.

309
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:31.459
and they walk sideways.
you know. and that's unsettling. at best."

310
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.295
What. what. what?

311
00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.504
[crowd laughing]

312
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.465
And then you look at 'em and they go…

313
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:38.549
[droning]

314
00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.843
They stand up and go… [clacking]

315
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.678
Like. "Chop. dice!"

316
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.389
They just want to kill.
They're not scared of you.

317
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.308
They're just spiders with good PR.

318
00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:49.435
I don't know how everyone's into crabs.

319
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:51.645
And they tap on windows. [clacking]

320
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.647
They're all… They're fucked up.

321
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.816
So the guy is like. "Uh. yeah." you know?

322
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.986
And so I go.
"I need less than 100 in the house."

323
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.113
And then even in my room.

324
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.325
which is. you know. second floor.
they're just all in there waiting for me.

325
00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:07.495
There's seven minimum when I go to bed.

326
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.915
I'm going to bed and the guy goes.
"Oh. they won't go on your bed."

327
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:15.461
And I go. "Well. they climbed
a 60-foot wall to get to my room."

328
00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:16.378
[crowd laughing]

329
00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:20.216
"I think they can handle
my Sealy Posturepedic mattress."

330
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:24.595
'Cause the lights are on.
so I'm sleeping like this…

331
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.139
And they go like this… [clacking]

332
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.058
And then I open my eyes and they go…

333
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.851
[crowd laughing]

334
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:31.811
And then I go…

335
00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.565
It's Squid Game.
You know. it's red light. green light.

336
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.525
I don't like it.

337
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.069
How did they see it first?

338
00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.029
[crowd laughing. applauding]

339
00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.906
And I go.
"How are they getting in my room?"

340
00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:45.866
Meanwhile. I look.
It's this thick under my door.

341
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.952
The crabs
don't even have to go smash down.

342
00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:50.830
They're like. "Jama Day. Hey…" [humming]

343
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.706
They come right in. Nobody cares.

344
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.918
And then I'm down with the guy

345
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:59.213
and I'm trying to explain that I don't
like them falling off the ceiling on me.

346
00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:00.548
which they do.

347
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.384
And he's… he's like. "Oh…" You know?

348
00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:07.012
And I go. uh… I look at the stairs
and there's a tail going up the upstairs.

349
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:07.930
A furry tail. I go.

350
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.142
"Hey. what's. uh… You catch
that tail heading up to my room?"

351
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.602
And he goes. "Oh."

352
00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.523
"Uh. that. uh. might be a haguar."

353
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.608
[crowd laughing]

354
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.406
"I'm sorry. I didn't catch that."

355
00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:29.201
He goes. "Haguar."

356
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.160
I go.

357
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:35.082
"You're not by any means
saying jaguar. are you?"

358
00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.584
And he goes. "Yes."

359
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:39.003
"And you're not saying it happy?"

360
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.548
You should be like.
"Yeah. Fuck. man. A jaguar!"

361
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.884
"You might die." but he goes. "Yes."

362
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.677
And he goes… He gives me the good news.

363
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.680
He goes. "But you know. not too many."

364
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:51.348
[crowd laughing]

365
00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.059
Okay.

366
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.354
I go. "I've heard one
can cause a ruckus. but sure."

367
00:14:57.438 --> 00:15:00.357
Anyway. I look again
and the tail comes down. I go. "Oh!"

368
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.860
And he goes. "Oh. no. It's just a lemur."

369
00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:05.279
And I go. "A lemur. Thank God."

370
00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.865
I have no idea what that is.
but I go. "It's gotta be better."

371
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:08.782
[crowd laughing]

372
00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:09.783
And I go. "Lemur."

373
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.620
And I see them 'cause they're
on the glass trying to get in there like…

374
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:13.954
[clacking]

375
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:16.749
And they're tapping
and. like. Morse-coding their friends.

376
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.292
going. "Kill at midnight."

377
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:21.837
and they're all gathered around
and then the lemur comes up.

378
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.297
and I go. "Hey. This is cute."

379
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.508
He's like. "Yeah." He picks up
three crabs and goes… [chomping]

380
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.718
I go. "Goddamn!"

381
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.803
He goes. "You're next. You're upstairs."

382
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:30.971
I go. "What do you know?"

383
00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.057
[crowd laughing]

384
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.644
The guy's like.
"Well. time for me to go." [chuckling]

385
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.479
"Is it lemur season? What's happening?"

386
00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:40.773
Anyway. he leaves.
I go to Bachelor in Paradise.

387
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:44.234
which is basically a Toyota fuckathon.
You know. You're nodding your head.

388
00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:46.236
I mean. good God.

389
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.154
Whatever.

390
00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.031
[crowd laughing]

391
00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:51.742
Anyway. enough about that.
I'll tell you about my sweet mother.

392
00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:52.743
My mom.

393
00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:55.245
I went home for Christmas.
She's very sweet.

394
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.791
We took pictures at dinner.
she put them on Facebook within minutes.

395
00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.167
Didn't clear it with anyone.

396
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:04.713
Um. that's how she does it.
Got five likes. She's stoked.

397
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.048
[crowd laughing]

398
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.259
Um. but now she has a dog
named Scooby. who's very cute.

399
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:12.388
She has. um.

400
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.726
a dog named Scooby. and Scooby
is a cute. uh. wiener dog. and very…

401
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.646
very skinny with the one ear up and…

402
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.563
[barking]

403
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.315
But now Scooby is super fat.

404
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.859
Because he used
to look like a young Brando.

405
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.778
Scooby is like this. you know.

406
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:31.490
and then now looks like Brando
in Godfather 10. like…

407
00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:34.410
He's so fat from Snausages.
and when he barks. he's like…

408
00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:35.411
[strained barking]

409
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:37.621
It's a fat bark. You know what I mean?

410
00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:38.747
It used to be… [yipping]

411
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.290
Now it's like…. [coughing]

412
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.250
[crowd laughing]

413
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.752
I go. "Are you barking? Are you coughing?"

414
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.548
So when she leaves. she feels guilty.

415
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.091
and he eats 24 hours a day.

416
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.343
And then she has a thing
called a Furby. or something.

417
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.429
that shoots them
out of the wall… [vocalizing] …like…

418
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:57.057
More food. When she's gone
to Costco. "Oh…" [vocalizing]

419
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.976
And then he's like. "Huh?"

420
00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.436
Ear. "Oh!"

421
00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.188
Because he's like. "Are there ghosts?"

422
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:05.274
And instead of being scared.

423
00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.651
he's like. "I'll worry about
the paranormal activity later."

424
00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.153
Let me eat this fucking Snausage.

425
00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.404
So he's like… [moaning]

426
00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:14.199
Crawls over. like. under the barbed wire
like boot camp. You know? [grunting]

427
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.368
Then he gets to it
and he's like… [sniffing]

428
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.203
[breathing deeply]

429
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.873
"What am I doing

430
00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:23.417
with my life.

431
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.794
eating constantly. and…"

432
00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:30.591
"My life is on a circle of just
stupid munching and getting fatter."

433
00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:33.802
"Obviously. I'm gonna eat it.
I'm just sort of thinking out loud. but…"

434
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:34.970
[chomping]

435
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:35.971
Then… [vocalizing]

436
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.473
…back to the couch.

437
00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:38.974
And then. when I come over.

438
00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.060
I go. "Scooby!"

439
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.352
And Scooby's like this.

440
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.271
"Ah. come here."

441
00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:45.481
[crowd laughing]

442
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.816
I go. "Fuck you!
Scooby. you run to the door."

443
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.069
"I'm the people. you know?" And he's like.

444
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.987
"Sit with Scoob! Come here."

445
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:53.363
"Come on."

446
00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:55.157
"Have a little sit with Scooby."

447
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.242
Get fucked.

448
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.619
[David chuckling lightly]

449
00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:00.537
I shouldn't say that to a dog.
but you know.

450
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.206
You know how it goes.

451
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:07.836
[whispering] Scooby…
I'm not gonna tell you about that.

452
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.756
I will tell you
that my neck gives me trouble.

453
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:12.758
So I got a massage.

454
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.677
I try to get a professional massage

455
00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.096
at a very nice hotel.

456
00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:20.265
So I go to the masseuse.
You know. I call down.

457
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.310
And I don't wanna sound like a creepo.
but I go. "Can I get a girl masseuse?"

458
00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:26.563
I always do. Give me a girl
so I look like the tough one. You know?

459
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.565
-[crowd laughing]
-[David laughing]

460
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:32.402
So they go.
"Sure. it's not a… it's not a problem."

461
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.863
But here it is five o'clock.
And I'm like… [moaning]

462
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.573
-Then I hear…
-[thudding]

463
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.158
I go. "Good God."

464
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.076
I walk over.

465
00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:40.744
[honking] I look through.

466
00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:43.831
and it's 6'5" Dolph Lundgren…

467
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:44.748
[groaning]

468
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:47.584
…like. out there. and I go. "No. no."

469
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.544
I go.

470
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:51.964
"I'm sorry. Are you looking
for the steroid machine?" He goes.

471
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.133
[in accent] "I am masseuse."

472
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.094
I go. "No. no. no. Not for me."

473
00:18:57.177 --> 00:18:59.763
"I said a girl."
He goes. "There is no girls left."

474
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.348
"It's just me. but I'm a teddy bear."

475
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:02.724
I go… [chuckling]

476
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.769
"I don't know why.
I don't like it. I don't want it."

477
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.064
He goes. "No. trust me."

478
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.816
"I look big and strong."

479
00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:13.193
"I'm a teddy bear.
and they charge you either way."

480
00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:14.611
I go. "All right. Come on in."

481
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:18.824
Because my chintziness.
you know. won that one.

482
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:21.577
So he comes in.
and I go. "Let's just try it out."

483
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.746
So he picks me up like a ragdoll
and throws me on the…

484
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.416
I go. "I can get on the table. sir."

485
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.668
[crowd laughing]

486
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.129
Makes me sound like the biggest pussy.
He goes… [grunting]

487
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:33.255
I go…

488
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.506
[crowd laughing]

489
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.384
And then I go… [grunting]
…like I can barely get on the table.

490
00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:40.095
I go. "Okay.
Well. I didn't know it was this high."

491
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.013
And so…

492
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.932
I put my face in the circle. and then.

493
00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.602
"You let me know
if there's any instructions

494
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:50.022
because again. I am a…"
I go. "Yeah. yeah. Teddy bear. Just go."

495
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:53.483
So… Because I'm the type
that never complains in the massage.

496
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:55.444
And he goes like this…

497
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.862
[crunching]

498
00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:57.905
My face is going….

499
00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.364
[groaning loudly]

500
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.909
Then he goes snap
on my neck. I go… [screaming]

501
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.286
Then I. finally… I just go.
"A little lighter." And he goes…

502
00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.287
[shushing]

503
00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:07.956
[crowd laughing]

504
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.461
You don't shush.

505
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.879
I'm the customer.

506
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:16.715
And then he goes…

507
00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:17.674
[crunching]

508
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.468
I'm like. "Ugh. ooh. aah."

509
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.844
Keeps going. Keeps going.

510
00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:23.597
I'm in horrifying pain for a solid hour.

511
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.016
Everything's painful.
Nothing's fun about it.

512
00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:28.352
And I had the balls
right in the middle to go.

513
00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.645
"Maybe pull it back 10%."

514
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.729
[shushing]

515
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.357
I shushed like a pussy.

516
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.319
I lay down there. hor--
And then I get up and tip him.

517
00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.570
Psycho.

518
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.488
I'm psycho.

519
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.114
Tip.

520
00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:42.741
The worst.

521
00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:43.784
I tip.

522
00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:45.369
[crowd laughing]

523
00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:46.912
I go. "Dude…" And then I apologize.

524
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:51.458
"I'm sorry. I just didn't mean to like…
I just feel weird 'cause you're a guy.

525
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:55.754
and I… I don't like
to feel arm hair on my back.

526
00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:58.882
or your boner
jamming in my ribs. you know?"

527
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:00.717
"I'm old-school."

528
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.761
[crowd laughing]

529
00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:04.846
But my friend said.
"Oh. if your neck hurts.

530
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.849
go to this weed store
in LA on the street called Yucca."

531
00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.309
Yucca. you don't even need to know.

532
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:12.437
It's the skankiest.
roughest street in Hollywood.

533
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.274
It's so gross. Everyone's
getting killed there at all times.

534
00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:16.233
I never go on it.

535
00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:18.568
I don't even go to the 7-Eleven there.
And then they go…

536
00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.070
You're supposed to park

537
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:23.365
and just voluntarily go in a place
on the worst street in America

538
00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:26.868
where when there's a shooting.
even cops go. "It's Yucca."

539
00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.787
You know? They text each other.

540
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.956
"Yucca." Shrug emoji.

541
00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:31.999
[crowd laughing]

542
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:33.458
Squirt gun. Hey.

543
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.128
So I go.

544
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:40.257
And it's not
the Apple clean. iPhone store.

545
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.843
No. It's… Looks like World War Z.

546
00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:43.927
And then…

547
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.345
[crowd laughing]

548
00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.055
…I voluntarily go into this shithole.

549
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.433
and I'm like. "Hey."
and then this guy is like… [groaning]

550
00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.852
I go. "Hey man.
I need some weed pen or something."

551
00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:53.228
He goes… [nervously chuckling]

552
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.897
I go. "Do you work here?"
He goes… [groaning sheepishly]

553
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.942
"I'm… I have anxiety."

554
00:21:59.026 --> 00:21:59.860
I go.

555
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:03.280
"I don't give a shit. dude.
I'm sorry. but like…"

556
00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:05.949
He goes. "Ugh. My job is hard."

557
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.576
I go.

558
00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.245
"Dude. I hated every job
I had my whole life."

559
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.414
I can't take younger kids
that wanna quit everything.

560
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.958
I go. "Dude.
let me tell you some bad news."

561
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:18.962
"I had anxiety
from when I was born till right now."

562
00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:21.381
"It doesn't get easier. dude.
It all sucks."

563
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:24.051
"And if you quit. you'll freak out
that you don't have a job."

564
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.011
"So just stick it out. dude.
I'm telling you."

565
00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:28.722
"You think I like being a dishwasher
and a busboy? Just do it."

566
00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:30.891
He's like. "Ah. Stress!"

567
00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.517
[crowd laughing]

568
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:36.897
So then the owner comes out.
"Hey. Mr. Spade."

569
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.357
He puffs up a little bit.

570
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.816
"Hey. Jimmy. We got him."

571
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.276
"I got you. boss."

572
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.362
"Hey. take care of Mr. Spade."

573
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.572
"You get him a. uh…
get him some fentanyl crab cakes."

574
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:47.741
"And will you get him… [smacking lips]

575
00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:48.909
…some. uh… [clicking tongue]

576
00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:50.827
…uh. LSD candy corn."

577
00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:53.538
So I go. "No. no.
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay."

578
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:56.833
He goes. "Well. at least have a gummy
on me as an app--"

579
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.753
I go like this… [chewing]
He goes. "Well. don't eat it all." I go…

580
00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:01.546
[crowd laughing]

581
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.590
"Don't eat all of that thing?"

582
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:04.966
He goes. "Just eat the ear."

583
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.970
I go. "Fuck you. It's one inch
of food! Dude. I'm eating it all."

584
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.180
[crowd laughing]

585
00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:12.766
"I should have the ear? That's this big."

586
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.103
He goes. "Oh. you're gonna be
all fucked up." I go. "Well…"

587
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.689
"I don't know.
If you give me a cookie. I eat it all."

588
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:22.275
"Don't tell me to. you know.
eat one crumb at a time."

589
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.985
"Like. put each one in a baggie."

590
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.154
"Like. that's a hit. Like. I get it."

591
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:31.076
I don't like all this shit because I have…
I have vodka soda and two gets me drunk.

592
00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:33.036
three is too much. but I can gauge it.

593
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.788
This is like…
I don't know what's happening.

594
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.541
"I can't have an inch?"
"No. I wouldn't." I go…

595
00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:38.708
[crowd laughing]

596
00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:40.627
Fentanyl crab cakes.

597
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.130
Meanwhile. fentanyl is.
like. the worst thing in the world.

598
00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.256
You guys know. it's…

599
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:46.049
I read it's 100 times stronger
than heroin.

600
00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:47.843
[scattered laughing]

601
00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.094
Uh. I'm sorry. What?

602
00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:50.554
What?

603
00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:54.766
Not three. not four. 100 times.

604
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.560
America.

605
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.688
how fucked up do we really need to be?

606
00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.982
I mean. good God!

607
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:04.568
And since when was heroin for pussies?

608
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.736
Honestly. when did that happen?

609
00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:08.405
"You're still doing heroin?"

610
00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:10.949
"No. no. Just till
my fentanyl guy gets here. No. no."

611
00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:12.701
"No. no. Heroin's like ZzzQuil."

612
00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:15.579
"No. I just relax. I just do it to chill."

613
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:18.081
[crowd laughing]

614
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:20.750
Jesus.

615
00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:25.213
I've been offered drugs.
and I wish people would be honest.

616
00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.966
Like. when people offer me drugs.
I act cool

617
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.385
if I don't want it.

618
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.179
but I don't just say that.

619
00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.723
I'm such a loser.
Like. someone offered me heroin.

620
00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:35.724
I'd never seen it.

621
00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:39.895
This guy goes. "Spade." I go. "What's up?"
They go. "Want some heroin? I go. "Uh…"

622
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:42.481
"I'm good."

623
00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.983
What am I? What's the pause about?

624
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.026
What am I doing?

625
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:47.944
What am I wrestling with?

626
00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:50.697
I'm not doing it. but I had to be cool.

627
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.409
I go. "Uh. shit. I just ate. Oh…"

628
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:57.287
"Um. God damn. What time is it? Uh…"

629
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.665
"Fuck! Oh. that looks
like a good batch too."

630
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.459
[crowd laughing]

631
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.376
Batch?

632
00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:05.754
"Oh. looks chunky."

633
00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:08.924
"Improving."

634
00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:12.552
"Oh. man. that looks like
it's really got some fucked up shit."

635
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:15.096
I don't know what I'm saying.
But then I go. "You know what?"

636
00:25:15.722 --> 00:25:17.557
"Can you find me again?
Ask me in a half-hour."

637
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:19.184
"You swear to God you'll come find me?"

638
00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.685
He's like. "Yeah." I'm like. "Cool."

639
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:22.437
[trilling]

640
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.897
Run to my car and cry.

641
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.900
Because honestly. if I saw heroin.

642
00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:30.320
I'd really want to jump on a stool
and go "Eek. a mouse." you know. but…

643
00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:31.279
[crowd laughing]

644
00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:33.865
I. uh…

645
00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.409
Oh. I look good? Thank you.

646
00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:37.702
Did you say that?

647
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.870
Was I thinking that?

648
00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:40.121
-[girl whooping]
-I…

649
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.915
No. I… It's funny. 'cause…

650
00:25:41.998 --> 00:25:44.251
I… I've always weighed about 140.

651
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.378
And the subject of weight
is funny. 'cause with guys…

652
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:48.213
Girls have a lot of pressure about weight.

653
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:51.007
and guys don't really.
but you try to stay in shape.

654
00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:54.761
And I remember I got weighed the last time
when I was about. you know. 30.

655
00:25:54.844 --> 00:25:56.972
And I weighed about 140.

656
00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.974
And then for the rest of my life

657
00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.517
I said I weighed 140.

658
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.769
I never checked again.
I never looked again.

659
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:03.937
[crowd laughing]

660
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.605
"What's your weight?" "140."

661
00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:11.736
So… But. you know. you fluctuate.
So I porked up a little along the way.

662
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.698
And it sort of backfired
on me 'cause I was…

663
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.908
I was doing a movie.
and when you do movie.

664
00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:20.870
you have to get. uh.
a physical for insurance.

665
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.664
So here's a little
inside Hollywood for you.

666
00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:24.583
So every TV show or movie
you have to do this.

667
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:28.920
And when we were doing Grown Ups.
I had to go in and get. uh. tested for it.

668
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.047
And Grown Ups is a movie
you've probably seen

669
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:34.551
because we've been keeping the lights on
at TBS for the last five years.

670
00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:36.720
-[crowd cheering]
-You almost can't not see it.

671
00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:38.346
It's like A Clockwork Orange.

672
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.432
[crowd laughing]

673
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:41.600
So…

674
00:26:41.683 --> 00:26:44.394
Anyway. I get called in and the doctor…

675
00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:47.022
But they're so…
they're such quick meetings.

676
00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:47.939
they're almost fake.

677
00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:49.190
So I don't even want to go in.

678
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.358
This is how bad I'm getting.

679
00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:53.445
So the doctor calls me and goes.
"Hey. come in for a physical."

680
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:56.281
I go. "Can we just do this
on the phone. dude?" He goes…

681
00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:58.825
"Do. you know.
a physical exam on the phone?"

682
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:00.493
I go. "Yeah. You've seen me on TMZ."

683
00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:02.787
"I'm out there jumping around.
I'm all good."

684
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:03.705
[crowd laughing]

685
00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.290
He goes. "No. I'd like you to come in."

686
00:27:05.373 --> 00:27:08.293
So I go. "Adam's not gonna like this."

687
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:13.006
Oh. I shove Sandler
down their gullet whenever I can.

688
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.467
Just to get him quaking in his boots.

689
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.426
[crowd laughing]

690
00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:18.136
But he goes. "No. Just come in."

691
00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.805
I use it all the time. actually.
I use it at Taco Bell.

692
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:22.641
"Oh. you don't have the chalupa today?"

693
00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:24.976
"Adam's not gonna like this."

694
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.062
[crowd laughing]

695
00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:31.066
"You got it now?"

696
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:33.902
He's like. "Who's Adam?"
So it doesn't always work.

697
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.819
But…

698
00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:38.698
So here I am. I go in to the doctor
and he's like. blood pressure this.

699
00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:39.949
He goes. "How much you weigh?"

700
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.618
I go. "140. He goes. "140?"

701
00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.537
"Is that what you're trying to pull off?"
I go…

702
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.539
[crowd laughing]

703
00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:49.626
"Sir. I'm 140 and scribble it down."
He goes…

704
00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:51.920
"Why don't you jump on the scale

705
00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:54.381
and I'll make an honest man
out of you." I go…

706
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.885
"Dude. I was kidding earlier.
but Adam is not gonna like this."

707
00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.638
He's like… [whistling] "I'll risk it so…"

708
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:08.395
So I go over
to this old man doctor stick scale thing.

709
00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:11.106
You know. with the two sticks
and little cinder blocks.

710
00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:14.067
Little black cinder blocks. I go.
"These are 50 each. right?"

711
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.113
So… [speaking gibberish]
I'm gonna put this on 100.

712
00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.864
And then… [clacking] …the one-pounder.

713
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:22.450
I'm going to put on… [clacking] …45.

714
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.662
"I'm 145. 'cause I'm such a fat ox.
according to you."

715
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:26.913
But I'm kind of scared.

716
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:28.748
"What is he talking about?"
So I go like this…

717
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.625
[yelling] You know…

718
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:34.087
'Cause when I get on a scale.
I go arms up. eyebrows up.

719
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.630
Think feathers. you know.

720
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.549
'Cause you wanna be light.

721
00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:38.967
[crowd laughing]

722
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.219
No one gets
on a scale and goes… [straining]

723
00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:42.220
You know…

724
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.639
I'm like Ariana Grande.

725
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:45.682
So…

726
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:47.392
I go like that. it goes…

727
00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:48.852
[shouting]

728
00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:50.520
Everyone in the office goes… "Ow!"

729
00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:53.356
I go. "Oh. hey. I put on a few."

730
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.776
So now I'm panicking. [vocalizing] Sweat.

731
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.738
And then he goes.
"Uh. try again." And I go… [exhaling]

732
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.531
"All right. Here we go."

733
00:29:01.614 --> 00:29:02.907
[clacking]

734
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:03.950
Uh… [speaking gibberish]

735
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:07.620
I put on 150 and then I take
the little one-pounder and I go…

736
00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:08.830
[clacking]

737
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.165
I put it on zero. I go.

738
00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:14.627
"Okay. I'm almost 150. Fuck. here we go."
And then I'm like. "Oh my God."

739
00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:18.089
Wait a second. Shoes off.

740
00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.592
Socks off.

741
00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.344
[whispering] Pants off.

742
00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.097
-[crowd laughing]
-Hat. Wallet. Watch.

743
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.600
I have hairspray in my hair.
Write that down. Here we go.

744
00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:29.934
[vocalizing]

745
00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.352
And this thing goes… [clacking]

746
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:35.607
…and this guy comes over
with the pure humiliation. over my face.

747
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:38.193
[clacking]

748
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.444
[crowd laughing]

749
00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:42.822
"What the fuck's happening?"

750
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.618
"Oh. you're cramping up?" [clacking]

751
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.705
[screeching] "Oh. it moved. Stop."

752
00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:53.875
165.

753
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:56.336
[groaning]

754
00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:58.713
[crowd laughing]

755
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.341
165. I go.

756
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.095
"There's no way
I have 25 pounds of mystery weight

757
00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:09.474
somewhere on my body
that I don't even know about."

758
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:11.601
And he goes.

759
00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.853
"Adam's not gonna like this."

760
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:17.273
[crowd laughing. applauding. cheering]

761
00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:20.944
[David] Ugh.

762
00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:23.863
My worst fear.

763
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:24.864
[crowd chuckling]

764
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:25.824
Then I told a girl.

765
00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:30.620
"Do you know I have 25 blubbery pounds
rolling around in my body somewhere

766
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:32.997
that I don't even know where it is?"

767
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:36.626
And she goes. "I know.
I gained the first ten in my boobs."

768
00:30:36.709 --> 00:30:37.627
I go.

769
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:41.798
"I'm sorry. Is that a fake problem
you're trying to compare?"

770
00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:45.885
"Do you think if I gained
the first ten pounds in my dick and balls.

771
00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:47.554
I'd be worried about it and crying?"

772
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.765
"Oh. my dick's so huge!
I've been eating a lot!"

773
00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:53.142
"Oh. and my balls.
I have to wear sweats all day."

774
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:55.019
"No. I'd be at Pizza Hut

775
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.231
with every other guy I know."

776
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.066
"Loading up."

777
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:01.860
[crowd laughing]

778
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.529
My real doctor says.
"You need to come in for a colonoscopy."

779
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:05.822
I'm like. "Ugh."

780
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:07.782
I go. "I'm camera shy."

781
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.868
[crowd laughing]

782
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.703
Not very photogenic. And he goes.

783
00:31:11.786 --> 00:31:14.330
"You know. if you don't wanna do that.
there's a thing you can do."

784
00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:17.625
"If you want to try it where you sort of

785
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:21.504
go to the restroom in a box
and you send it into the lab.

786
00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:22.839
and they check it."

787
00:31:22.922 --> 00:31:25.174
"And if you don't have cancer.
you're off the hook."

788
00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:26.885
I go. "I'll do that. Like. let's do that."

789
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:30.221
So I poop in a box…

790
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:31.514
[crowd laughing]

791
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.391
…I send it to the lab.

792
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.977
they send it right back to me and say.

793
00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:38.271
"Please don't send us this."

794
00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:41.441
"Your doctor's playing a joke on you."

795
00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:42.650
[crowd laughing]

796
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:46.738
"There's no way we can dig
through a box of your dirty shit

797
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:49.407
and find out if you have cancer.
Are you an idiot?"

798
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:54.495
"I dated him ten years ago.
Tell him it's not funny anymore."

799
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:56.205
Stop.

800
00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:58.291
[crowd laughing]

801
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:02.045
He goes. "Did you send it?"

802
00:32:02.128 --> 00:32:04.297
I go. "Yeah." He goes. "Excellent!"

803
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:06.299
"I hate her."

804
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.636
Why am I in this? Why am I involved?

805
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.891
[David chuckling lightly]

806
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.895
I had a great dinner tonight
in one of your beautiful restaurants.

807
00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:20.563
Um. yeah.

808
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.398
[crowd cheering. applauding]

809
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:23.650
[David] Beautiful town.

810
00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:28.279
Actually. the hostess. uh. tried
to strike up a little jibber-jabber.

811
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:29.656
you know. which is fine.

812
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:32.700
but usually goes nowhere
because we're walking ten feet. You know?

813
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:35.495
She goes.
"Mr. Spade. we're so excited to have you."

814
00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:36.663
"How was your week?"

815
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:39.040
I go. "I had a little bit
of a health scare." "Here we are."

816
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.626
[crowd laughing]

817
00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.595
"I'm sure it's nothing. I wouldn't worry
about it at all. you know."

818
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:56.724
"I'll get a CAT scan. I'll CC
the whole hostess team. I'm sure it's…"

819
00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.394
She didn't give a fuck.

820
00:32:59.894 --> 00:33:04.273
And then I sit down. and sometimes
it's such a nice restaurant that the…

821
00:33:04.857 --> 00:33:06.275
the fish is market price.

822
00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:09.445
You ever seen that?
They don't even tell you how much it is.

823
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:12.532
I think the waiter tries to guess
how rich you are. because I go. uh.

824
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:15.326
"How much is the tuna?" He goes. "Um…"

825
00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:19.288
[whistling] "The tuna is…"

826
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:21.165
[speaking gibberish]

827
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:24.585
"Seventy."

828
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.005
I go. "70 bucks?" He goes. "40. 40. 40."

829
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.631
[crowd laughing]

830
00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.841
Oh. it's not too bad.

831
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.803
I think he has an earpiece in there like.
"What is he wearing? Go lower."

832
00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:35.179
[crowd laughing]

833
00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:37.807
"What? Is he wearing
a cowboy shirt? Go lower."

834
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.018
[David chuckling]

835
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:44.397
Yeah. but sometimes
just if they act too hoofy doofy.

836
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.774
I stupidly will say "shrimps" wrong.

837
00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.609
just to see if they correct me.

838
00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.194
So it's always

839
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.738
so dumb.

840
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.491
I go. "Do you guys have any shrimps?"

841
00:33:55.992 --> 00:33:57.201
And he goes…

842
00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.078
[crowd laughing]

843
00:33:59.162 --> 00:33:59.996
"Yeah."

844
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.623
"Yeah. We do. We. uh… we do have shrimp."

845
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:06.502
But he can't… he has to help me.
but he doesn't… he just can't say it.

846
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:10.089
And I go. "Oh yeah?
Oh. cool. cool. cool. cool."

847
00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:12.717
"Do you have. uh. like. five shrimps?"

848
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.094
[crowd laughing]

849
00:34:15.928 --> 00:34:19.348
"Yeah. There's a scenario
where you could get five shrimp."

850
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.813
"There's no way you could take ten shrimps
and jam 'em in a circle."

851
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.315
"Make a shrimps cocktail."

852
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.859
He's like.
"No one ever said fucking shrimps cocktail

853
00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:31.402
in the history of the world."

854
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.071
[crowd laughing]

855
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:36.491
I go. "What are your fishes?
Honestly. Do you have elks?"

856
00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:40.787
I like to go to McDonald's. I go.
"What's your Filet o' Fish of the day?"

857
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.871
[clearing throat]

858
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:44.540
"I think yesterday was a branzino."

859
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:46.834
"I think."

860
00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:48.544
[crowd laughing]

861
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:49.921
Stupid.

862
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:50.838
But then…

863
00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.842
my phone was running low
and I was like. "Oh."

864
00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:57.970
I wanted to plug it in. The hostess goes.
"I can plug it in for you."

865
00:34:58.054 --> 00:34:59.138
And I go… [groaning]

866
00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.308
"I'll just take it from you."

867
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:03.226
I go…

868
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:06.104
[groaning]

869
00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:08.648
[whispering] Terrifying.

870
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:11.609
She goes.
"It'll be just around the corner."

871
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.945
I go. "Where I can't even see it?"

872
00:35:14.028 --> 00:35:14.946
[crowd laughing]

873
00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:16.114
I'm not giving it up.

874
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.698
Now I know how Alec Baldwin felt.

875
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:18.699
I get it. man.

876
00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:23.329
You don't want to give up that phone.
There's too much stuff on it.

877
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:26.082
They take his phone.
they're looking for one thing.

878
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.208
Some text saying.

879
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.669
"I'm gonna put real bullets
in the gun and surprise everyone."

880
00:35:29.752 --> 00:35:31.087
If it's not that.

881
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:33.673
what are you looking for?

882
00:35:33.756 --> 00:35:37.009
I don't want that hostess
to roll through my camera. you know.

883
00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:40.388
and find those 500 dick pics
that didn't make the cut.

884
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.514
[crowd laughing]

885
00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:43.141
Did not make the cut.

886
00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:45.726
Mine's not showing well. guys.
I got bad news.

887
00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:49.147
What? You know. And that's… you gotta…

888
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.482
That's currency.
I mean. this is a new world.

889
00:35:52.191 --> 00:35:54.569
That's… You used to have to do that.

890
00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.529
You know what I mean? At the end.

891
00:35:56.612 --> 00:35:59.949
Now you lead with it.
Hey. Here's my dick. If you wanna…

892
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.412
You like it? You wanna meet for coffee?

893
00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.539
We have any chemistry or…

894
00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:07.999
So far so good.

895
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.879
I'm so old you used to. uh. have to sketch
out your dick to give it to a girl.

896
00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:14.547
You know? Like. before cameras.

897
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.965
[crowd laughing]

898
00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:17.008
Shading.

899
00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:21.220
But actually. I told my friend.

900
00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.097
I go. "Are you taking these pictures or…"

901
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.892
And he goes. "Yeah." And I go. "You are?"

902
00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:29.770
I go. "Show me one. but don't be a weirdo.
but I want to see. Like what…"

903
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.148
And he shows it to me and it's like this.

904
00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:34.358
I go.
"You didn't even get a courtesy rod?"

905
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:37.862
He goes.
"She knows if she likes it. I send the…"

906
00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:40.656
I go. "That's not how it works. dude."

907
00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.534
"It's like Eminem. You get one shot."

908
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:44.869
"You're out!"

909
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:46.537
"No one's looking for potential."

910
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.080
"What are you talking about?"

911
00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:50.583
And I asked this girl. I go.

912
00:36:50.666 --> 00:36:52.960
"Uh. do you get 'em?"
She goes. "Ugh. They're horrifying."

913
00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:55.379
I go. "Well. I have to take one.
So. what do I do?"

914
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:57.840
And she goes. "There was one."

915
00:36:57.924 --> 00:37:00.051
I go. "Okay. What was the one you liked?"

916
00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:02.929
She goes. "Well. he was laying
on his side. It was from his feet up

917
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:05.264
and he had it in a chokehold.
on his elbow." I go…

918
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:08.809
"I gotta get my buddy involved?"

919
00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:13.564
That's so horrible.
"Hey. Before the movie. real quick."

920
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.942
"Just gonna take everything off."

921
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:17.693
"Don't be weird. And I'm gonna lay down.

922
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.947
I'm gonna slap together a partial.
get a little floater going."

923
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.323
"I'm gonna slam it in a drawer."

924
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.825
"Just get some… a couple ccs of plasma."

925
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.953
"And listen. I'm gonna choke it.

926
00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:28.996
and you take pictures
on three. All right?"

927
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.749
"And. actually. take my camera
and you're gonna take way too many."

928
00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:33.292
"I'll do the kills later."

929
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:34.877
"Just… [trilling] …like. go nuts."

930
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.212
"All right? 1. 2. 3."

931
00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:39.090
Choke. choke. choke.
Go. go. go. Now. now. now.

932
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:41.175
[crowd laughing]

933
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:44.011
It's worse than helping me move.

934
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:48.266
I tried it. I go.
"I'm just gonna take it in my house."

935
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.142
Like. the worst lighting. I know nothing.

936
00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:52.478
I'm just like. "In kitchen."

937
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:53.562
[crowd laughing]

938
00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:55.398
[speaking gibberish]

939
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:56.607
Just naked.

940
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.902
Horrifying fluorescent gross lighting.

941
00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:00.945
Really bad.

942
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.029
Uh.

943
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.864
backyard drone shot.

944
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.408
[buzzing]

945
00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:07.868
But I had a rod.
So. it sort of canceled it out. You know?

946
00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.620
It was like a sundial.

947
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:10.871
[crowd laughing]

948
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.206
And then I took one from behind.

949
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.332
[speaking gibberish]

950
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:14.458
My dick wasn't even in it.

951
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:17.169
But you know what? I'm trying things.

952
00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:18.421
I'm brainstorming.

953
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:20.548
It was all balls.

954
00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.633
[crowd laughing]

955
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:25.386
It was a niche market. [chuckling]

956
00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.306
And don't lay down on a couch. guys.

957
00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:30.766
You get that bird in a nest look. That's…

958
00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:33.060
[crowd laughing]

959
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.020
…unappealing.

960
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.482
A lot of unfollows. a couple of blocks.

961
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.151
Two reports.

962
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:42.695
[David laughing]

963
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:48.951
Ugh. I'm trying to watch more porn.

964
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.786
It's tough. you know? I just…

965
00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.289
Actually. I have some good news.

966
00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:56.459
I did have
a threesome recently in college.

967
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:57.752
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah.

968
00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:01.380
The college threesome is. um…

969
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:03.758
Wasn't great. I. uh…

970
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.469
It was me. my buddy. and this other dude
and here's what happened.

971
00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:07.678
Here's how we did it.

972
00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:09.221
-[crowd laughing]
-You know. here's…

973
00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:10.264
Listen.

974
00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:14.101
The third was supposed to be a girl.
That was the whole plan.

975
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.895
And then we had it all set up

976
00:39:15.978 --> 00:39:18.397
and then she flaked at the last minute.

977
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:20.983
And I said. "Let's just grab him.
Let's just run through it once."

978
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:24.153
"Let's just get the beats down.
Let's just see if it even works."

979
00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:25.071
I mean.

980
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.947
do the blocking.

981
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.825
And uh. in hindsight it was a little gay.

982
00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:33.371
You know what? Because
I didn't think it through and it was.

983
00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:34.288
It was fine.

984
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:37.541
But later…
about ten years later I had another one.

985
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.961
but that was screwy
because it was me and a guy and a girl.

986
00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.839
We're in a hotel room getting ready
for a concert. everyone's drinking.

987
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:45.966
and someone goes. "Let's do a threesome."

988
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.469
Everyone's like. "Yeah."
No one really knows what that means.

989
00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:51.931
And so I go to get a drink
and then they hook up

990
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:54.183
and he walks away and goes. "You're up."

991
00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:56.268
-And I go…
-[crowd laughing]

992
00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.189
This feels like sloppy seconds to me.

993
00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:04.568
Am I crazy? I mean. it was sold to me.

994
00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:08.906
I feel like I might have
some legal recourse

995
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.409
because… There should be
a lawyer commercial for this

996
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:12.910
'cause there is for everything else.

997
00:40:12.993 --> 00:40:16.288
"Have you ever been sold a threesome
and it was really sloppy seconds?"

998
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:18.582
Yes! Yes. I have.

999
00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:22.002
"You may be entitled
to some compensation."

1000
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.087
[crowd laughing]

1001
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.088
Ah.

1002
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.216
This is my mesothelioma. guys. Let's…

1003
00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:33.097
But I try to watch porn.

1004
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.558
You ever watch porn websites?
My buddy goes. "Watch this one."

1005
00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:37.309
I go. "Oh. I can't watch another one."

1006
00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.353
I've only seen.
like. 500 million videos. but I go.

1007
00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:41.397
"Oh. I'll see what's out there." You know.

1008
00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:44.650
But I don't wanna
get stuck for three days.

1009
00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:46.360
You know. I just want to go in and out.

1010
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.737
So I just type in "hand job video."
the easiest one.

1011
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:50.739
Just… just get… get a feel for it.

1012
00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:56.203
So it comes up and then under it it says.
"Other videos we think you'll like."

1013
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.664
[crowd laughing]

1014
00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:02.460
Have you ever seen
the other videos they think you'll like?

1015
00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:06.755
First one.
"Teenager gets gangbanged in an elevator."

1016
00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:08.674
I'm like. "I'd like that?"

1017
00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:10.551
"Yeah. Yes. you would."

1018
00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:12.470
I go. "No. I did hand jobs."

1019
00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:14.221
"That's the ea-- That's nothing."

1020
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:17.558
"No. We've run some analytics on you."

1021
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.977
"No. you haven't. I punched three keys."

1022
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.897
"You're in a really dark place
right now." "I am?"

1023
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.939
"Hand job."

1024
00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.110
"Oh. you're gonna watch it now
or in a week from now."

1025
00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:30.779
"What's it gonna be?"
I'm like. "Ugh. Now."

1026
00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:32.156
[crowd laughing]

1027
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.074
This thing knows me
better than my therapist.

1028
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:37.912
But I did think
that they all have big wieners.

1029
00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.789
And I was like.
"Ugh. I wish I had a huge porn wiener."

1030
00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:41.749
And then…

1031
00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:46.295
And then I thought. "But do I?"
Like. this'll probably never happen.

1032
00:41:46.378 --> 00:41:49.006
but if I find a bottle.
if there's a genie in it…

1033
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:52.968
And so many things have to happen.
but let's say… [whisping] …it comes out

1034
00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:55.095
and he goes. "You get one wish."

1035
00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.722
No. wait. I can't do it.

1036
00:41:56.805 --> 00:41:58.224
You know what I mean. 'cause…

1037
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.808
Too selfish.

1038
00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:02.895
There's so much going on
I could fix. You know?

1039
00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:06.106
I wouldn't do it. If I had ten wishes.

1040
00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:08.442
[groaning]

1041
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.903
I'd probably bury it
toward the end. You know?

1042
00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:13.822
When the genie wasn't even
paying attention anymore. Like…

1043
00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:17.785
I'd get all the good ones. I'd cure this…
[muttering] …but at the end. yeah.

1044
00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:20.162
But if I had five. that's a tricky one.

1045
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.872
Five? [groaning]

1046
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:27.169
Don't make me even think about it
because I think it would be number five.

1047
00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:28.504
I know.

1048
00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:33.759
I'd cure some stuff. but fuck.
sometimes the house wins. You know?

1049
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:36.720
That's how it works in Vegas. man.

1050
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:37.930
[crowd laughing]

1051
00:42:38.013 --> 00:42:39.348
Shiite.

1052
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.185
No. but I was. uh. on the old laptop.

1053
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:45.271
You know what clickbait is? You do.

1054
00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:49.233
Clickbait is… I'll tell you.
I did a show in Nashville.

1055
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.860
Someone had a. uh. seizure in the back.

1056
00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:55.155
and they dragged him out.
and then the next day on Yahoo

1057
00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.742
it said. "David Spade
stops show because of seizure."

1058
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.412
So it's sort of
a clicky headline that doesn't…

1059
00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:04.164
You don't know what it means.
but it's a trick to get you to click on.

1060
00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.209
Usually you click on it
and you go down all these wormholes.

1061
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:09.712
and it's all these windows
and it's like a trick.

1062
00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:12.131
So it's better than every other article.

1063
00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:13.132
So here I am stupid.

1064
00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:16.677
I know what it is and I'm watching.
and it's like "Cardi B does this."

1065
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.387
and "Minnesota weather." and then it says.

1066
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.807
"What's the one vegetable
Tom Brady refuses to eat?"

1067
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.892
[crowd laughing]

1068
00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:27.730
What?

1069
00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.316
So stupid. Who cares?

1070
00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.654
What is it. a coconut?

1071
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:37.364
[crowd laughing]

1072
00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.617
It's so dumb. And then I go down.

1073
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:44.288
But it's all blurry because I can't focus
because that's all I think about.

1074
00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:45.331
And they got me.

1075
00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:48.042
So I go all the way back
and I clicked on it.

1076
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.627
and here we go.

1077
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.671
First window. "Tom Brady
was born in Northern California."

1078
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:57.051
Mm-hmm.

1079
00:43:58.052 --> 00:43:58.886
Next.

1080
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:02.890
"Tom Brady started playing football
at the age of seven."

1081
00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.975
[crowd laughing]

1082
00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:10.481
[smacking lips]

1083
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.526
Where are the fucking vegetables

1084
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.862
that you swore to God

1085
00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:18.364
you would tell me about?

1086
00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.618
I'll save you 27 clicks.

1087
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.787
It's a tomato. ladies and gentlemen.

1088
00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:26.121
I was way off.

1089
00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:31.543
But I can't take it
because four minutes later I'm down there.

1090
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:34.004
Weather? Football? And it goes.

1091
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:37.424
"You'll never guess
what this '80s actress looks like now."

1092
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.510
[crowd laughing]

1093
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:45.891
Oh boy.

1094
00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:49.853
Um. I will save you
55 clicks and two and a half hours.

1095
00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:52.106
She looks like shit. ladies and gentlemen.

1096
00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:55.234
It's so mean.

1097
00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:57.611
I mean. she aged 30 years in 30 years.

1098
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.987
That was her big crime.

1099
00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:04.159
Sorry she doesn't look like
she did on Gilligan's Island. You know?

1100
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.205
And the next one said.
"Look at this motherfu…"

1101
00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:09.248
It was me.

1102
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:11.333
[crowd laughing]

1103
00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:14.628
"What happened to this guy?"

1104
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:16.672
And it was a good picture.

1105
00:45:18.924 --> 00:45:21.009
Oh boy. but that's not…

1106
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:23.429
That's neither here nor there. guys.

1107
00:45:24.263 --> 00:45:25.222
[groaning]

1108
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.226
I remember the last day
before the old. um…

1109
00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:31.353
You know. lockdown.

1110
00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:33.313
My big day was… Went to IHOP.

1111
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:35.983
-You do know what IHOP is?
-[man] I do.

1112
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.943
Okay. We're getting somewhere.

1113
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:38.902
Um.

1114
00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.655
and I found a hair in my eggs.

1115
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:42.948
and I ate them anyway.

1116
00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:44.241
Here's what happened.

1117
00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:47.453
I didn't wanna wait 20 minutes
to… for new ones.

1118
00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:50.122
and there was no witnesses.

1119
00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:52.291
But it was a pube. I should've said that.

1120
00:45:52.374 --> 00:45:54.918
-[crowd laughing]
-That makes it a little weird. Right?

1121
00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:58.046
Little wiggly pube.
You can tell a pube on sight.

1122
00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:01.592
It's got a little wessonality to it.
You know?

1123
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:04.261
And it was still attached
to the guy's balls.

1124
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:05.554
That was the worst part.

1125
00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:06.889
[crowd laughing]

1126
00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:09.892
I ate around it. I didn't care.
He didn't care. I didn't care.

1127
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:12.853
But he didn't work there. I thought…

1128
00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.440
So. by the way. pubes are out there

1129
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:18.776
and I know girls are like.
"Oh. I'm hardwood. not carpet."

1130
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:20.486
but guys…

1131
00:46:20.986 --> 00:46:21.987
Oh.

1132
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:23.113
it is Mount Pubic.

1133
00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:25.949
If you've ever been
to the urinal here… here.

1134
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.745
There's maybe 50.000 pubes in it

1135
00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:31.497
and I… I don't know how.

1136
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:33.332
You go in there.

1137
00:46:33.415 --> 00:46:35.709
just pull your wiener out and pee.

1138
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:38.754
What's the ruckus and commotion?

1139
00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.757
It's like you're cleaning a brush.

1140
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.258
-[yelling]
-[crowd laughing]

1141
00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:46.428
Wha… What?
And there's ten on the upper deck.

1142
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.848
Are they. like…
They're… they're making a break for it.

1143
00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.849
Anyway. I don't know.

1144
00:46:50.933 --> 00:46:54.269
I'm not gonna fix that tonight.
but that makes me crazy.

1145
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:57.689
So I'm brainwashed into liking beavers

1146
00:46:57.773 --> 00:47:00.651
because I grew up with bushes.

1147
00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:04.655
I grew up with Hustler
and Penthouse and Play-- You know.

1148
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:06.824
All these had a bush.

1149
00:47:06.907 --> 00:47:08.659
and a girl…

1150
00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:11.245
I finally s-saw one.
I go. "Oh. your bush."

1151
00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.664
The girl goes.
"Yeah. 'cause I grew up. I'm a woman now."

1152
00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:15.999
"That's what happens.
What do you like? Bald?"

1153
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:17.835
"Like a nine-year-old?
Like a child molester?"

1154
00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:18.961
I go. "No. no."

1155
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.879
But now.

1156
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:22.673
any girl.

1157
00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:25.008
"You don't have a bush?"
They go. "Is that what you like?"

1158
00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:25.968
I go.

1159
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:30.097
"No. I like. um. bald nine-year-old.
child molester."

1160
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.808
She's like. "Good. good.
That's what you're getting."

1161
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:34.685
I'm like. "What is the real story?"

1162
00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:37.271
I mean. girls.
get together. figure it out because

1163
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.565
the first one makes sense.

1164
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:42.442
And by the way. it wasn't just a cute
little landing strip.

1165
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:43.569
Not when I started.

1166
00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:46.780
Oh no. It was a babushka.

1167
00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:49.116
-Oh my God.
-[crowd laughing]

1168
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.451
It was like home plate.
You know what I mean?

1169
00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.121
Like. down the legs a little.

1170
00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.164
It was like crab grass.
You know what I mean?

1171
00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:58.959
Tickling the ribs a little.
There's no rules.

1172
00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.085
It was lawless.

1173
00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:02.045
[crowd laughing]

1174
00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:05.799
They'd wear those old undies.
looked like an airbag went off.

1175
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.135
[David laughing]

1176
00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.762
I'd sleep on it
like a My Pillow commercial.

1177
00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:13.473
[crowd laughing hysterically]

1178
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.062
You'd take it off and pull on them
they're three and a half feet long.

1179
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:20.063
[boinging]

1180
00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.773
Jam down.

1181
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.192
[groaning]

1182
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:27.821
So I went to Macy's
the other day to buy some. uh…

1183
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:31.116
Just some things.
I had to get socks. I had to get a shirt.

1184
00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.327
So I go… I go to the Macy's in the Valley.

1185
00:48:33.952 --> 00:48:35.078
Uh.

1186
00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:38.123
it's farther. but I'm about
9% more famous over that one.

1187
00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:41.460
so it's worth the drive. you know.

1188
00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.253
I have an app that tells me.

1189
00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:45.714
So I go over there and…

1190
00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:49.927
First thing I wanna get is socks.
but they don't sell socks like shoes.

1191
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.553
It's not size 8. 9. 10.

1192
00:48:51.637 --> 00:48:54.598
It's literally "fits sizes 5 to 28."

1193
00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:59.811
I'm just glad they don't sell condoms
like that. you know.

1194
00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:02.356
"Fits sizes Asian to Black guy."

1195
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:05.776
Because I… I sort of know that I'm all…

1196
00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:08.695
By the way. here's a trick. guys.
Here's a tip.

1197
00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:11.198
Buy those Magnum rubs.

1198
00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.950
You know what I mean? The really big ones?

1199
00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.118
Just to. like. get girls in a good mood.

1200
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:17.871
You don't have to use them.
Just. like. pepper them around the house.

1201
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:20.916
You know what I mean? Throw one
in the fireplace. one by the Vitamix.

1202
00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:23.335
Doesn't even matter.
Like not so obvious.

1203
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:25.545
I use them as coasters.
That's stupid. It's too obvious.

1204
00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:28.006
Girl's like. "Oh my God."

1205
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.216
I'm like. "What?"

1206
00:49:30.092 --> 00:49:31.593
"What is that doing there?"

1207
00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.762
"That should be on my dick."

1208
00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:35.847
[crowd laughing]

1209
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:38.141
Ah?

1210
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.727
I'm so embarrassed.

1211
00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:47.275
But you really shouldn't wear the ones
that are too big. You know?

1212
00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:50.237
Because nothing's worse
than a droopy rubber. Right. gals?

1213
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.363
I mean. it's not…

1214
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.532
It's so embarrassing.

1215
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:57.119
You're like.
"This is… this is ridiculous."

1216
00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:59.413
"This one is broken. And you know what?"

1217
00:50:00.038 --> 00:50:03.125
"I never write a company.
I'm going to fire off an email. This is…"

1218
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:04.459
"Dear sirs."

1219
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:05.419
[crowd laughing]

1220
00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:08.380
It's always embarrassing
to borrow their scrunchie to keep it on.

1221
00:50:08.463 --> 00:50:11.925
"Can I… can I use that for one second?
Just to double…"

1222
00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:15.095
And you don't want it loose side to side.

1223
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.305
You're like…
♪ Clang. clang. clang goes the trolley ♪

1224
00:50:17.389 --> 00:50:19.516
You try to joke it off.
You know? And it's…

1225
00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:21.393
[crowd laughing]

1226
00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:24.062
I wanna invent Magnum Juniors.

1227
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:25.939
Come on Shark Tank!

1228
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.774
Magnum and then in little words "Juniors."

1229
00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.901
So you're like. "Junior."

1230
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.031
Thinking ahead.

1231
00:50:35.657 --> 00:50:40.495
And then I bought a shirt.
and they have a nine-way mirror in Macy's.

1232
00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:43.457
Now. folks.
have you seen yourself from the side?

1233
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.541
Don't recommend it.

1234
00:50:44.624 --> 00:50:46.793
Um. try to avoid it.

1235
00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:50.881
I am barely okay with what I look like
in a one-way mirror.

1236
00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:52.215
Do you understand? Like…

1237
00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:54.968
I'm a six or seven. I read the internet.

1238
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.763
I'm more personality driven.
That's fine. That's fine.

1239
00:50:58.263 --> 00:50:59.890
I'm okay with that at this point.

1240
00:50:59.973 --> 00:51:02.726
I get it. but for me.
looking in the mirror.

1241
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:05.812
I know when I look okay for me.
So I try the shirt on. I go…

1242
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:06.813
[vocalizing]

1243
00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.065
"This one's not too bad."

1244
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.274
"This is a. uh.

1245
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.443
cowboy sh…"

1246
00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.529
[crowd laughing]

1247
00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.948
"Is that… That's not… Is that me?"

1248
00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:18.992
"Shut the fu…"

1249
00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.995
"Sickening. That's me?"

1250
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:26.333
"That's me from the side?
That's what the world sees every day?"

1251
00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.667
"Who invited Gollum in here?"

1252
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:28.835
[retching]

1253
00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.962
"God damn. It's so sad."

1254
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:34.966
I'm literally like a seven. six. five.
two. two. two. two. two. two.

1255
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.551
[crowd laughing]

1256
00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:37.469
Brutal.

1257
00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:41.681
And then I have no confidence.
so if I go to a bar. I just stay flat.

1258
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:43.558
"Hey. You ladies work together?"

1259
00:51:44.726 --> 00:51:46.103
"Oh. All in the same company. huh?"

1260
00:51:46.853 --> 00:51:47.854
"That's interesting."

1261
00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:51.983
"What are you drinking?
Vodka soda? Vodka soda? I'll do a run."

1262
00:51:52.818 --> 00:51:54.402
[crowd laughing]

1263
00:51:55.654 --> 00:51:56.530
"Stay flat."

1264
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.243
Jesus.

1265
00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:03.578
Jeez.

1266
00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.374
[sighing heavily]

1267
00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.668
I think my friend's a pedophile. but. um…

1268
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.587
I'm gonna change gears here.

1269
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.966
Um. but I'm not sure.

1270
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.636
I feel like I should gather
a little more data before I turn him in.

1271
00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:22.556
But. right now. it's just a hunch.

1272
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:27.435
I went over to his house and he's watching
the Little League World Series.

1273
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.688
[crowd laughing]

1274
00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:30.730
I don't like it.

1275
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:34.317
I even gave him an out. I go. "Hey. uh…"

1276
00:52:34.943 --> 00:52:36.820
"You know some…
you know some kid on this TV?"

1277
00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:37.779
He goes. "No."

1278
00:52:41.783 --> 00:52:44.578
"But you gotta admit
they're amazing athletes."

1279
00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:47.247
Are they? They're 12.

1280
00:52:47.914 --> 00:52:50.584
He goes. "Look at the calves
on that one." I'm like. "Later."

1281
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.836
Here I go. I'm gonna tiptoe out

1282
00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:54.754
while the SWAT team comes in.

1283
00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:57.132
But it is a weird world now

1284
00:52:57.215 --> 00:52:59.885
where you can't even give someone
compliments about their kid.

1285
00:52:59.968 --> 00:53:03.513
You used to be able to. Like. I got a lot.

1286
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:04.431
Um…

1287
00:53:05.473 --> 00:53:08.310
But. you know. like. someone's
with their seven-year-old daughter.

1288
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:10.103
and if you ever go. "Hey. your daughter…"

1289
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:13.023
You can't even say.
"Hey. Your daughter's pretty." They go…

1290
00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:16.067
[crowd laughing]

1291
00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:18.612
What? Come on. really?

1292
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:20.739
Then I get offended.

1293
00:53:20.822 --> 00:53:22.407
I want to defend myself and go.

1294
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.368
"Dude. I'm not some creep child molester.

1295
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:28.496
and believe me. if I was.
I'm not starting with your kid."

1296
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.332
"Believe me. she's not that great."

1297
00:53:30.832 --> 00:53:32.334
"Yeah. She's okay."

1298
00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.462
"If I'm doing that.
I'm starting with that kid

1299
00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.047
I saw at 7-Eleven three days ago."

1300
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.298
"That's number one."

1301
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.884
"Yours is… [whistling]
…way down the list."

1302
00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:43.178
"Creep."

1303
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:44.930
[crowd laughing]

1304
00:53:45.013 --> 00:53:47.307
Actually. when things happen
early in life.

1305
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.976
the. uh… you don't know
the repercussions they have later.

1306
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.396
Like. just pantsing people
in grade school.

1307
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.440
Stupid. funny. We've all done it.

1308
00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:59.194
I was 11. where soccer…

1309
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:03.949
Someone dared me to pants the coach.
Now. this is such a bad idea in hindsight.

1310
00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.451
Pants the coach during a game.

1311
00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:12.165
And no one tells me he had the biggest
wang. prong. anaconda. dick in history.

1312
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.042
and he doesn't wear underpants.

1313
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.752
So. here I go.

1314
00:54:15.835 --> 00:54:16.753
And I go…

1315
00:54:16.836 --> 00:54:17.963
[speaking gibberish]

1316
00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:19.839
And everyone just went.

1317
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.383
"What the fuck?"

1318
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.969
And the whole stadium froze.

1319
00:54:25.553 --> 00:54:27.889
Especially him. He loved it.

1320
00:54:28.848 --> 00:54:32.310
He sat there and let it wave
in the breeze for a while.

1321
00:54:32.894 --> 00:54:34.437
"Drink it in!"

1322
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:36.064
[crowd laughing]

1323
00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:38.483
Let everyone know who's boss. You know?

1324
00:54:39.401 --> 00:54:43.029
He didn't even pull 'em up. He waited
for a timeout. eight minutes later.

1325
00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:44.781
He finally goes.

1326
00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:46.866
"Ah. you crazy kids."

1327
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.952
[crowd laughing]

1328
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:56.459
And then. all the moms started coming
to practice an hour early. You know.

1329
00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:00.714
Dressed like they're going to
the Golden Globes or something.

1330
00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.883
Sure.

1331
00:55:06.177 --> 00:55:07.762
Flirting with girls is tough.

1332
00:55:07.846 --> 00:55:09.973
You know. sometimes
you flirt with a girl you go…

1333
00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:12.225
Like I asked a girl out.
and guys. here's a tip.

1334
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:15.729
If they don't text you back right away.
you're dead in the water. It's over.

1335
00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:18.606
Because I texted a girl.
took her four days.

1336
00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:21.818
and she's like.
"Oh my God. I'm the worst texter."

1337
00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.154
And I go. "Huh. Yeah."

1338
00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:25.864
And then I answer

1339
00:55:25.947 --> 00:55:28.325
and then three days later she goes.
"Oh my God. I spaced."

1340
00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:29.951
"I'm so bad at this."

1341
00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:35.290
No one's bad at texting.
by the way. no one on this planet.

1342
00:55:35.373 --> 00:55:39.169
And it's just such a bullshit excuse.
cause I did finally get her out to dinner.

1343
00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.588
And all night.
she's hunched over phone like this.

1344
00:55:42.213 --> 00:55:43.590
[trilling]

1345
00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:48.970
I go. "Oh.
I see you're getting the hang of it."

1346
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:51.056
[crowd laughing]

1347
00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:54.851
"You're really picking it up."

1348
00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:56.269
"Good for you."

1349
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.982
So dumb. So dumb!

1350
00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:03.151
Oh boy. so…

1351
00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:06.363
I saw. um.

1352
00:56:06.946 --> 00:56:08.490
Caitlyn Jenner at a car show.

1353
00:56:09.324 --> 00:56:10.909
You know who Caitlyn Jenner is?

1354
00:56:10.992 --> 00:56:12.869
Caitlyn Jenner. when I grew up.

1355
00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:14.829
was Bruce Jenner
for a long time in the Olympics.

1356
00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:18.083
and there was a little switcheroo
which you heard about. and. uh. fine.

1357
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:23.671
The only part of that
that I thought was a little… interesting

1358
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.757
was the name Caitlyn because

1359
00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:29.761
that's reserved for 30-year-old girls
in my head.

1360
00:56:29.844 --> 00:56:33.515
That's like a psychological trick
to sound younger. which I get it.

1361
00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:34.599
but it is a trick.

1362
00:56:34.682 --> 00:56:36.142
I mean. listen. my name's David.

1363
00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.395
It's like Marlon Blando.
Like. who cares about David?

1364
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:39.979
It's so dumb and forgettable.

1365
00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:44.192
If I wanted to sound 27. I'd change
my name to Connor. You know what I mean?

1366
00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:46.152
And then I'm 27 overnight.

1367
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.572
They're like. "Connor Spade.
what's up?" I'm like. "Just vaping."

1368
00:56:49.656 --> 00:56:51.658
[crowd laughing]

1369
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:55.370
But it does sound. you know.

1370
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.288
It might work.

1371
00:56:57.372 --> 00:57:00.625
And Caitlyn. she was like. 71.

1372
00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:01.543
You know what?

1373
00:57:02.043 --> 00:57:03.586
You don't get to be Caitlyn.

1374
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.506
You know what your name should be? Barb.

1375
00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:09.551
Barb Jenner. hi.

1376
00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:11.553
[crowd laughing. cheering. applauding]

1377
00:57:11.636 --> 00:57:12.804
"I'm Barb."

1378
00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:14.431
"How are you?"

1379
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:17.767
Or Dottie or Ruthie. anything.

1380
00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:20.186
You're not Dakota. you're Dolores.

1381
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.771
I mean. make it make sense.

1382
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:27.610
But honestly. even my friends old me up.
I hate getting olded up by my friends.

1383
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:29.362
I have girls.
I go. "Wanna meet my friends?"

1384
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.031
I see you coming I go.
"You know Rick. Pete. and Roger?"

1385
00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.658
They're like. "What the fuck?"

1386
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:35.452
"No. thanks. Sounds old over there."

1387
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:36.661
"I don't need to see him."

1388
00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:37.996
[chuckling lightly]

1389
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:38.913
It's tragic.

1390
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:41.499
I have to lie.
"Oh. you know. Aiden. Cayden. and Jaden."

1391
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:44.043
They're like. "Oh! Yeah."

1392
00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.670
"Let's get a bottle."

1393
00:57:45.753 --> 00:57:47.046
[crowd laughing]

1394
00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.173
And when Caitlyn

1395
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.216
came out.

1396
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.427
I mean.
all the celebrities were so supportive.

1397
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:56.222
I mean. Courteney Cox and Cindy Crawford
were like. "Caitlyn looks amazing."

1398
00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.099
"She is so beautiful."

1399
00:57:58.183 --> 00:58:00.185
And they're like.
"Oh. you kind of look like her."

1400
00:58:00.268 --> 00:58:01.936
"Fuck you. Are you serious?"

1401
00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:06.232
"That monster?
Take it back. Take it back."

1402
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.860
The guy's like. "You kind of
changed your tune a little bit."

1403
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.862
[crowd laughing]

1404
00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:11.863
[David laughing]

1405
00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:15.241
You're having fun. aren't you? Good.

1406
00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.284
[crowd cheering]

1407
00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:17.285
All right. Yeah.

1408
00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:19.162
I love it here. guys.

1409
00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.457
I love it that you came down.

1410
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:25.710
I got my cowboy shirt.

1411
00:58:25.793 --> 00:58:29.380
Things are clicking.
Things are really… I did fly.

1412
00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:33.468
I flew here on a… I'm gonna say Southwest.

1413
00:58:36.095 --> 00:58:39.682
Southwest is kind of a crummy airline.
And this does not leave this building.

1414
00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:40.600
Um…

1415
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.771
They… First of all.
I've flown them for years. You know.

1416
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.023
But when I go in the terminal.

1417
00:58:47.106 --> 00:58:51.110
I'm not even a quarter mile away.
and they're like. "Whoa. whoa. whoa!"

1418
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.656
"Before you get on board.
we have to clean the aircraft."

1419
00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:57.492
It's literally one guy with Febreze
going like this… [blowing raspberry]

1420
00:58:57.575 --> 00:58:58.868
"All right. Bring them on."

1421
00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:01.538
"Bring on the cattle."
And it's literally everyone.

1422
00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:02.830
"Number 1 through 1000."

1423
00:59:02.914 --> 00:59:04.832
I'm like. "Oh. that's me." [grunting]

1424
00:59:04.916 --> 00:59:07.794
It's like electric football. You know.
everyone smashing into each other.

1425
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.420
And then…

1426
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:12.423
This… the flight attendant
has got the shorts on.

1427
00:59:13.007 --> 00:59:14.342
'cause they're the fun airline.

1428
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:16.803
Let me tell you a secret.
No one's having fun.

1429
00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.179
She's not. I'm not.

1430
00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:21.349
She's drenched in sweat
'cause Vegas is their hub.

1431
00:59:21.432 --> 00:59:22.267
Lingo.

1432
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:25.270
And so she's straddling jetway
to plane like this.

1433
00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:27.897
"Get on the plane.
Everyone get on the plane."

1434
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:29.941
"Please. we have to push off the gate."

1435
00:59:30.024 --> 00:59:32.151
That's all they care about.
"Push off the gate."

1436
00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:34.779
"Push. push. Gate. gate. Off. Go."

1437
00:59:34.862 --> 00:59:36.406
And we're in the hall and I'm like this.

1438
00:59:36.489 --> 00:59:40.410
And she goes. "Please. quit looking
for an aisle seat. There's none."

1439
00:59:40.493 --> 00:59:43.746
"There's only middle seats.
We're the only all middle seat airline."

1440
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.914
"It's almost impossible."

1441
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:49.252
"We only have middle seats. And don't even
dart your eyes at the overhead."

1442
00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:51.462
"Those are full. They're slammed shut."

1443
00:59:51.546 --> 00:59:53.590
"They've been full since 4 a.m."

1444
00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:57.760
"We don't have room for a phone cord.
a nickel. or a marshmallow."

1445
00:59:57.844 --> 00:59:59.095
"Sit down."

1446
00:59:59.178 --> 01:00:02.265
"Put your crap on your lap. You paid $49."

1447
01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:05.602
"You made a deal with the devil.
You knew what you were getting into."

1448
01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.395
"Zip it and shut up."

1449
01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:08.438
[crowd laughing]

1450
01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:10.690
So I'm sitting there
with my crap on my lap.

1451
01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:14.319
and I say to the guy.
"Do you think there's food on this…?"

1452
01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.989
"This guy thinks there's food!"
I go. "No. I was… I was just asking."

1453
01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.699
"Here's the food sitch."

1454
01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.786
"We have five bags of peanuts left."

1455
01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.666
"Halfway through the flight
we'll shoot 'em out with a T-shirt gun."

1456
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.877
"All right? So look alive. Heads up."

1457
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:34.714
"One of them's honey-roasted.
You might win the lotto."

1458
01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.798
[crowd laughing]

1459
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:39.886
"If you have a peanut allergy. tough shit.
Two are open already."

1460
01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:43.014
"So you're sort of soaking it in.
Madge. so…

1461
01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:45.975
please crawl and die in the lav."

1462
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:48.561
But they were very nice.

1463
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.146
When I left the plane I said.

1464
01:00:50.229 --> 01:00:51.856
"You know what?
I just wanna thank you guys

1465
01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:55.985
because everyone's calling in sick now
and the flights are delayed.

1466
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.320
but I appreciate you coming in."

1467
01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.614
And she goes.
"I know. I have COVID and I came in."

1468
01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:01.407
And I go. "I know. and thank you."

1469
01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.035
That's what I mean. Above and beyond.

1470
01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:05.995
[crowd laughing]

1471
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.955
[David laughing]

1472
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.126
Porn genie.

1473
01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:14.545
I. uh… I did take a. um…

1474
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.172
Oh my God. It's a Rolex.

1475
01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:17.298
I did. um…

1476
01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.384
[crowd laughing]

1477
01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.970
[David chuckling]

1478
01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:25.973
Stupid. I…

1479
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.893
I took a private jet recently.

1480
01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:31.854
and I'm only bragging because I rarely do.

1481
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.732
You see. I see girls on Instagram.

1482
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:37.193
Why is it every single model
is on a private jet at all times.

1483
01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.028
You know how expensive they are?

1484
01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.863
I'm like.
"These girls are hybrid hookers."

1485
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.281
It's hard to explain. but…

1486
01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:45.868
they're not bullhooks. but you know what?

1487
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.370
Stay after and I'll tell you.

1488
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.831
But anyway. that's not why we're here.

1489
01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:52.291
But. I've been on private jets.

1490
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.335
I know how much they are.
and they're this big.

1491
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.337
They're literally like a thermometer.

1492
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.382
They don't show those on Instagram.
it's too embarrassing. I've been on them.

1493
01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.926
They're two feet high
and it's like an MRI with wings.

1494
01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:02.844
I'm like this…

1495
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:04.345
[crowd laughing]

1496
01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.346
[trilling]

1497
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.140
[clacking]

1498
01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:12.895
[imitating MRI sounds]

1499
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.816
You've had an MRI. You've had an MRI.

1500
01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:19.360
You've had an MRI.

1501
01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:22.071
Get that soundtrack just to chill.

1502
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.656
[crowd laughing]

1503
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.949
[imitating MRI sounds]

1504
01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:25.950
Hammer. Hammer.

1505
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.746
But yeah. so I got one juicy plane.

1506
01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.166
These guys flew me to a gig
in Jackson Hall.

1507
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.126
I was so stoked. I took my friend.

1508
01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.587
We're on the flight.
and I'm like. "Finally. a juicy jet

1509
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.256
and I get to live the hybrid hooker life."

1510
01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:43.009
So I'm on there. and I'm sitting there.

1511
01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.302
and it's going well.

1512
01:02:44.802 --> 01:02:48.222
And then the pilot comes out.
and he comes out like all doomsday.

1513
01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:49.265
He's like this.

1514
01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:52.518
[breathing heavily]

1515
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:55.271
I'm like. "Is this joker smoking?"

1516
01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.815
And he goes. "Here's what's going on."

1517
01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:01.110
"Uh. we're about 30 away.

1518
01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:04.655
and it's gonna get real bad."

1519
01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.949
[crowd laughing]

1520
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.285
Absolutely no bedside manner.

1521
01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:12.872
I go. "It's going to get real bad.
What do you mean? What. what. what? How?"

1522
01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:16.083
And he goes. "Well. there's
130 mile-an-hour winds

1523
01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.752
and there's a full snowstorm.

1524
01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:20.505
so it's gonna get real bad."

1525
01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.008
"But you know what?"

1526
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:25.259
"I say we go for it."

1527
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.512
[crowd laughing]

1528
01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.472
He walks away. I go. "What is it?"

1529
01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.142
"Did he say 'we're gonna go for it'?
What does that mean?"

1530
01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.187
My buddy was. "We're going for it."
I go. "Going for what?"

1531
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.688
"Is this scary?"

1532
01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:38.731
"Should we not do it?"

1533
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.066
Then it's like…

1534
01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.567
I go… [speaking gibberish]

1535
01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.737
I'm locked in like a bronco.
my Diet Coke hits the ceiling.

1536
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.364
Terrified. Terrified.

1537
01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:49.534
You know how some people
laugh when they're scared? I pee.

1538
01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.869
So I'm pissing all over the place.

1539
01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:54.413
Anyway. and then it stops for one second.

1540
01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.041
and he goes. "Go ask him."
I go… [panicked breathing] So I go…

1541
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.460
[breathing heavily]

1542
01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:00.378
[groaning]

1543
01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:01.420
I'm already sick.

1544
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.589
I go up. I go. "Hey. Earlier…"
and he goes. "What?"

1545
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.759
I go. "I'm the customer!
You don't yell at me."

1546
01:04:07.468 --> 01:04:11.389
"You said something earlier about going
for it. We don't have to go for anything."

1547
01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:14.433
"Like. who cares about the stupid game."
He goes. "Hey."

1548
01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:19.397
"Listen. if there's even 100 feet
of visibility above the tarmac.

1549
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.940
we can legally land."

1550
01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.108
I go.

1551
01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:24.026
"Legally?"

1552
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.571
"I… That sounds bad.
I don't want to leave."

1553
01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.531
He goes.
"We got a ten-second window. Sit down!"

1554
01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.158
I go. "God damn.
Why do I keep doing what you say?"

1555
01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:34.704
So I sit down and then this
wham. wham. wham. wham.

1556
01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.539
Can't believe how scary it is.

1557
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:37.957
And then we look out the window.

1558
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.751
Snow. snow. snow. And then blank.
And then… [thudding] …we hit.

1559
01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.754
I go. "Did we crash? No. we landed?"

1560
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.381
[whimpering]

1561
01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.717
So I get up and the stairs are like…

1562
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.676
[hissing]

1563
01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:51.637
And I go. "Oh my God. Oh my God. I lived."

1564
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.723
And then I go over and I go… [groaning]

1565
01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.767
And I get on the tarmac.

1566
01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.352
[blowing]

1567
01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.646
It is a solid mile of nothing.

1568
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.525
There is no other plane
within a mile. and I go.

1569
01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.235
"What's happening?"

1570
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.529
And then these two crew guys.
just go like this.

1571
01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.741
[crowd laughing]

1572
01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:13.659
I go. "What… what happened?"

1573
01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.746
They go. "Dude.
you just popped out of the clouds."

1574
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:23.044
I go. "What do you mean?" They go.
"It just popped out from 20 feet up."

1575
01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:23.961
"You just appeared."

1576
01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.838
I go. "Where is everybody?"

1577
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:29.717
He goes. "Oh. man.
37 planes had to divert."

1578
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.053
[crowd laughing]

1579
01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:33.804
"You're the only one that landed."

1580
01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.515
I go. "Shut up!"
I go. "Why'd they divert?"

1581
01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.185
I hear behind me.
"'Cause they're pussies."

1582
01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.144
I go…

1583
01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.021
-[crowd laughing]
-[David laughing]

1584
01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:45.149
You guys. thank you for having me.

1585
01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:46.359
[rock music playing]

1586
01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.401
I love you.

1587
01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:48.361
I appreciate it.

1588
01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.862
[crowd cheering. applauding]

1589
01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.665
[cheering. applause continues]

1590
01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:14.720
[music fades]
