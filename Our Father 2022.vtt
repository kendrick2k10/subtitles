3
00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:56.868
Jacoba?

4
00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.620
This is Dr. Cline.

5
00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:03.332
Do you have time
to talk with me just a little bit?

6
00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:05.293
-Yes.
-Okay.

7
00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:10.923
I'm getting a real problem with

8
00:34:11.674 --> 00:34:15.803
the television station. 59.

9
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:22.351
They're demanding that I meet with them.

10
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.438
I can't do that.

11
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:29.025
It's not fair to me.
it's not fair to you all.

12
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:32.737
They're trying to make a…

13
00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:39.619
They're trying to…

14
00:34:41.704 --> 00:34:43.581
improve their ratings.

15
00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:50.880
My wife and I.
after 57 years of marriage…

16
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:54.175
If this comes out.

17
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:57.845
our marriage will be over.

18
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.474
Can you help?

19
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:05.645
I mean. no disrespect.

20
00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:09.899
but I feel like what you're telling me
is to keep my life a secret.

21
00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:15.029
That I am not allowed to know who I am…

22
00:35:16.155 --> 00:35:18.533
- Well--
-…when I didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:22.161
Well. yes. but you know. I didn't--

24
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.540
At the time. I didn't feel like
I was doing anything wrong either.

25
00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:29.043
But I feel like I'm being blamed
for this. like it's my fault.

26
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.586
I don't understand.

27
00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:36.300
It's your fault
because. I don't care who you tell.

28
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.426
It's just.

29
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:43.182
putting it on television
for the entire world to see.

30
00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:48.938
Well. I cannot…
Like I said. I can't control her.

31
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:51.440
I can't stop that. I can't.

32
00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:55.945
Well. because you…
you can stop talking to her.

33
00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:58.781
You say. "You know.
I just don't want to share anymore."

34
00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:02.243
I'm just telling you what's gonna happen.

35
00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.871
and I'm going to be hurt badly.

36
00:36:04.954 --> 00:36:08.749
Well. that's
what's happened to everybody so far.

37
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.171
and you know.
that's because of the actions--

38
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:15.923
Well. this tells me that
that's exactly what you want.

39
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:29.226
She is demanding that I meet with them.

40
00:45:31.478 --> 00:45:33.981
They're going to force me to do this.

41
00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:36.316
I've gotta tell the truth.

42
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.194
And I don't want to do that.

43
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:34.244
What you're doing is
that you're telling the world.

44
00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:38.248
and the world doesn't need to know.

45
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:43.462
I'm not trying to do harm to you.

46
00:48:44.379 --> 00:48:45.881
Well. you are.

47
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.862
You know. I know
that nothing happens without God...

48
00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:09.115
allowing it.

49
00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:12.535
See.
I think that's where our problem is.

50
00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:15.121
I don't think that God
should have allowed it in the first place.

51
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:19.084
and I really think that we ask ourselves
every day. "Why are we here?"

52
00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:22.754
I think that's. like.
a lot of our problems.

53
00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:29.928
Well. you know.
I mentioned one of my favorite. um…

54
00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:35.934
One of my favorite scriptures
was Jeremiah 1:5.

55
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:38.853
If you'll remember. it says.

56
00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:42.524
"Before I formed you
in your mother's womb. I knew you."

57
00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:50.615
And that tells me.
and it should tell everybody

58
00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:54.911
that no one is born as a mistake.

59
01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.340
And how many times
did you use your own sample?

60
01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.592
Sparingly. but...

61
01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:09.139
keep in mind.
we're talking 30 to 35 years ago.

62
01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:12.268
and I can't remember.

63
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:15.062
All the records have been shredded.

64
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.126
Your honor. I'm asking for mercy

65
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.213
and compassion for myself.

66
01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:09.593
I've tried to live out my life

67
01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:12.346
showing honesty and care to others.

68
01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.640
and I will continue to do so.

69
01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.881
These are my words to Cline.

70
01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:51.635
Every time I or my half-siblings
look up our name.

71
01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:53.679
we all have the same issue tied to you.

72
01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.472
It has caused anguish in everyone.

73
01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.058
and some of us have
wanted to die from this pain.

74
01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:03.564
For 30 years. my half-sister. Julie.
believed her dad was her biological dad--

75
01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:05.232
Objection. Your Honor.

76
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.151
Relevancy.

77
01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:19.371
Because of your denials.

78
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.832
I feel you have
no consideration for the mothers

79
01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:24.793
who came to you.
us as your biological children.

80
01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:27.671
or your wife
and the four children you had with her.

81
01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:31.133
It was always about you.
You lied. You still lie.

82
01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:34.303
You even have your family believing you.
and that sickens me.

83
01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:36.513
-Our mothers trusted you–
-Objection!

84
01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:45.731
I'm asking you to look at the
depth of the reasons he is charged with--

85
01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:46.857
Objection!

86
01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:12.132
I do want to reiterate. probably
for the fifth or sixth time at this point.

87
01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:15.219
that the court. by law. can only consider

88
01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.263
the charges
that Dr. Cline's plead guilty to.

89
01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.599
the obstruction of justice charges.

90
01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:24.728
Obviously. it would be inappropriate
for me to consider outside of that realm.

91
01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.333
We received a number
of support letters for Dr. Cline.

92
01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:48.293
These are letters
from members of the community.

93
01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:52.297
former patients. and members
of Dr. Cline's family and church.

94
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.551
These individuals have known
Dr. Cline for many years.

95
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:58.637
And they evidence
a strong connection to his family.

96
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.973
the community. and that rehabilitation

97
01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.601
is not only possible
but actually has already taken place here.

98
01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.313
Please remember
that whatever happens during sentencing.

99
01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.940
the people that love you
are gonna continue to love you.

100
01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:02.034
With the limited resources
that we have. overcrowding at the jail.

101
01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.369
and your lack of a criminal history.

102
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.539
an executed sentence is nothing
that the court is going to order.

103
01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:22.012
I know that this is your
first offense. but Dr. Cline. I do believe

104
01:17:22.095 --> 01:17:26.850
that the facts support going ahead
and sentencing you as a level 6 felon.

105
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.604
As to fines and costs.

106
01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:33.732
sir. the court will fine you $500.

107
01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.076
As far as I know.

108
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.872
all of the inseminations
that I did with my sample.

109
01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:15.625
and again it was sparingly.

110
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.462
had a healthy baby.

111
01:29:48.966 --> 01:29:52.303
I don't want you
to think that I do this--

112
01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:56.182
I did the insemination with my own sample

113
01:29:56.265 --> 01:29:57.683
very blasé.

114
01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:03.022
Was there a sexual connotation to it?

115
01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.190
Absolutely not.

116
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:08.236
I don't look at these people

117
01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:10.696
and consider them to be my

118
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.532
children.
