635
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:42.125
I think that's life trying to show you
what kind of man you are.

It would have to be reported. And then...

It followed us here.

694
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.625
My husband's been chasing it
all night with a hammer.

695
00:56:46.916 --> 00:56:49.041
It knows great magic.

696
00:56:49.625 --> 00:56:52.625
It's filling this house with ghosts.

697
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:57.166
It torments my husband
with visits from her.

698

Nyagak.

699
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:05.666
But my husband is a very stubborn man.

700
00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:10.916
He still believes he can deny it.

701
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:13.875
You should put that into your report.

-[dog barking]

703
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:23.833
[Mark] We'd better write 'em up.

704
00:57:24.416 --> 00:57:25.666
They can kiss England goodbye.

[man] Dude. she was wearing her bedsheets.

706
00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:29.625
[Rial] This is what they want.

-They like to see us crazy.

-Makes them feel like big men.
-[van drives off]

709
00:57:39.333 --> 00:57:43.708
They don't want to be reminded
that it is them that are weak.

710
00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:46.375
How poor...

711
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.291
and lazy...

712
00:57:49.041 --> 00:57:51.333
and bored they are.

713
00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:52.458
Rial.

714
00:57:54.958 --> 00:57:56.541
Now. sorry.

715
00:57:58.583 --> 00:58:00.875
-Sorry. sorry. sorry...
-Rial.

716
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.833
And you...

717
00:58:08.208 --> 00:58:09.750
You still idolize them.

718
00:58:13.666 --> 00:58:15.708
[laughing] You beg them.

719
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:20.625
And then you thank them
for the unseasoned scraps they throw us.

720
00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:24.708
You eat them up.

721
00:58:32.666 --> 00:58:34.291
Let them send us back.

722
00:58:34.958 --> 00:58:36.666
But this is our home.

723
00:58:39.125 --> 00:58:40.708
We're going back.

724
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:45.375
I'm leaving. With or without you.

725
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:51.250
How quickly you forget everything
we went through to get here.

726
00:58:52.625 --> 00:58:55.541
How quickly you forget our daugh--

727
