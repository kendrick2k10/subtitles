about the friendship song.

Ohh. yes. sir.
I'm looking forward to it.

Good. Good.
You'll do... fine.

113
00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:36.091
Now. I am obligated
to ask you

114
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:38.267
because of some
unsettling events

115
00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:40.356
that have just
come to light. heh--

116
00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:43.272
Not with you!
Not... here. of course.

117
00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:45.230
Elsewhere.

118
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:49.147
The PTA asked me to ask
that you--

119
00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:51.585
not just you.
all the faculty--

120
00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:53.674
not. um...

121
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:56.024
and that is not to say
that we think that you would...

122
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:59.854
We don't enjoy making
people feel uncomfortable.

123
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:01.464
No. Not at all.
Please.

124
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.944
Well. you know.

125
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:06.034
I hate to be so specific.
but the PTA...

126
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:07.775
You know. they
really demand directness

127
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.733
with this sort of thing.

128
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.474
Well. yeah.
you have to be direct.

129
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.520
Mm. yes.
Better to say something

130
00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.217
than leave it unsaid.

131
00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:17.654
So I'll say it.

132
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:24.487
The PTA has asked me
to ask you

133
00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:29.405
not to. uh.
do anything.

134
00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:32.147

with the. uh...

135
00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:36.281
You know.

136
00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:37.935
-Oh. God.
-I know! I know..

137
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:40.677
You would never
do somethin' so heinous.

138
00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.549
But they feel
we should be blunt

139
00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:43.941
when it comes to matters
like this.

140
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.595
-Unsettling as they may be.
-Of course.

141
00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:48.468
And I appreciate
your being so direct.

142
00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:50.382
But let me be clear
that I would never--

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.167
No doubt.
No doubt.

144
00:07:52.254 --> 00:07:53.995
We have the utmost
confidence in you.

145
00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:56.214

149
00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:04.353
We just ask
that you don't...

150
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.050
Of course.
No. And thank you.

151
00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:07.356
I just-- let me assure you
that I would never--

152
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:09.793
No assurance needed.
I assured you!

154

It's just that California's
a coastal state.

155

and many find it
bewitching.

156
00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:16.017
You understand.

157

Yes. Yes.

158
00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:21.457
Anyway. glad we could
have this frank talk.

159
00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:23.024
Yes! Me. too.

160
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:26.288
-You won't. uh...
-No! Definitely not.

Pinky swear.

162
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.033
Good! Well. you...

163
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.817
better get a move on.

164
00:08:33.904 --> 00:08:34.949
Have fun!

165
00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:37.168

Right. And Janice.

194
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.747
And then there's....

195
00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:35.749
Yes! I exist.

196
00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:36.967
Uh. fortunately.

197
00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:38.229

everything they need
for this trip?

209
00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:04.995
Because once
we hit the freeway.

210
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:06.823
there's no comin' back.
that's it.

211

212
00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:09.652

Sorry. I couldn't sleep.

243
00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:06.943
Mind if I sit here?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.251
Uh...
[stammers] Uh. yeah.

245
00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:11.382
No. go ahead.

246
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:15.517
What are you
looking for?

247
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.911
-Huh?
-Your book?

248
00:12:17.998 --> 00:12:21.828
Oh! Yeah. it was--
it was at the gas station.

249
00:12:21.915 --> 00:12:24.526
Um. it tells you
places to visit

250
00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:28.530
based on what you're...
looking for.

251
00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.271
What are you looking for?

252
00:12:31.838 --> 00:12:34.928
Uh. I-I have--
I haven't traveled much.

253
00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:37.017
[stammering]

254
00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:39.062
I just got the book.

255
00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.587
What--
What are you into?

256
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:48.071
Oh. you know. different stuff.
Art. jazz... history.

257
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:50.639
Really? You? I--

258
00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:53.033
I-I mean. me too.

259
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.209
Wh-What kind
of history do you like?

260
00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:56.688
Sexual history.

261

What?

262
00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.561
You know. procreation.

263
00:12:59.648 --> 00:13:01.693
our biological
and cultural frameworks.

264
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.608
How they've changed
over the millennia.

265
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.045
Evolution wouldn't work

266
00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:06.916
if we weren't hardwired
to enjoy sex.

267
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:09.310
So. pleasure
is not only natural.

268
00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:10.311
it's essential.

269
00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:11.355
Isn't that neat?

270
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:15.533
Um... [stammering]
Definitely. yeah.

271
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.362
[scoffs]
Procreation is the best.

272
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.977
Uh. you must have...
fun homework.

273
00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:25.108
Can I sleep with you?

274
00:13:25.195 --> 00:13:26.631
What?

275
00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:29.591
The big doofus up there
keeps falling on me.

276
00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.071
Don't make me go back.

277
00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:34.074
Oh. and your shoulder
is so comfortable.

278
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:36.859
Uh... yeah.
No problem.

279
00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:39.427
Be mine... guest.

280
00:13:39.514 --> 00:13:40.645
Thanks.

281
00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:43.474
Your girlfriend
won't mind?

282
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:44.693
What. Maddy?

283
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.217
Oh... no.
we're not friends.

284
00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:49.567
We're-- We're just friends.

285
00:13:49.654 --> 00:13:52.701
Good. I wouldn't want
to steal you from anyone.

286
00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:54.398
Just borrow you.

287
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:58.533
Mmm. You smell nice.

288
00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.536
You don't mind?

289
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:05.757
Um... what a--
what about your girlfriend?

290
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.849
Wings? Oh. we're
not really together.

291
00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:11.981
I'm not even sure
if he likes me anymore.

292
00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:20.860
What are you doing?

293
00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:21.904
[whispering]
Homework.

294
00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:25.734
-Are you crazy?
-Shh.

295
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.605
No one has to know.

296
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:29.564
We can do it quietly.

297
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.827

308
00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:00.116
Well. only one way
to fix that.

All right. this one's mine.

You mean head to toe?

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:30.772
-Yeah.
-No.

330
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.964
It sucks. we should be
at the ocean right now.

At least the water's clear.
[sink sprays]

-Sheets are clean.
-Yeah. but what is this?

335
00:16:58.408 --> 00:17:01.585
-Is this blood?
-Oh. my God.

336
00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:03.544
I can't tell.

337
00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:05.633
Why does it always look dark
in these places?

338
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.939
Because sin lives
in the shadows.

339
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.812
Hey. speaking of sin...

340
00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:15.034

347
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.618
I can't believe
we're stranded here.

348
00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:36.794
Yeah. I know. but on
the bright side. no parents.

349
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:40.015
And Mr. Thompson barely counts
as adult supervision.

350
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.365
I wonder if there's
any food around here.

351
00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:44.672
-Holy shit.
-What?

352
00:17:47.196 --> 00:17:50.591
Dude. Tony says the girls just
invited them over for an orgy.

353
00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.028
-No way.
-Yeah. I know. but look.

354
00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:55.900
Man. they're just messing
with him.

355
00:17:55.987 --> 00:17:57.424
He says they're serious.

356
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.122
No. then they're definitely
messing with him.

357
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:03.082
Yeah. I guess.
Girls are just so immature.

358
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:04.909
-Totally.
-Boy: What are you looking at?

359
00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:06.998
-Nothing. Nothing.
-It's stupid.

362
00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:21.883
-You don't think...
-That they'd actually...

363
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.798
-There's no way. right?
-No. no way. of course not.

364
00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:25.930
They're just messing with us.
or them. messing with them.

366
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:28.890
-They're so gullible.
-I know.

367
00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:30.631
But not us.
We're better than that. No way.

368
00:18:30.718 --> 00:18:31.980
Mm-mm.

-Hi. is there
a liquor store nearby?

00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.861
-Um...
-Thompson: Liquor store?

372
00:18:45.254 --> 00:18:47.038
What for?

373
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.781
Um... supplies.
air freshener for...

374
00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:52.609
Jason's gas problem.

375
00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:55.351
Uh-huh. Come here for a second.

376
00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:00.487
Hey. you know this is
my first band trip. right?

377
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.359
-Yeah.
-Yeah. it's not going
that great.

378
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.057
So. uh. till the bus is fixed.

379
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.669
I kinda need
to take us somewhere
that's at least somewhat...

380
00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:10.149
educational.

381
00:19:11.062 --> 00:19:12.368
Can you help me pick one?

382
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.111
-Okay.
-It's just that
you're a good student.

383
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:19.332
I'm not a good teacher.
and I'm a temporary one
at that. so...

384
00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:20.768
Till the band kicks off.

385
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.291
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
The band. the band.

386
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:27.905
Well. I can
research these tonight
and hook you up tomorrow.

387
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.603
Would you?
Oh. Morgan. that would rock.

388
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.345
Thank you very much.
I appreciate you.

389
00:19:32.432 --> 00:19:34.042
Oh. one more thing.

390
00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:35.522
Will you help me keep
an eye on the others?

391
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:37.132
[sighs]
Dude...

392
00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:39.439
I know. nobody wants to be
a narc. it's just that...

393
00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:41.049
I'm all by myself out here.

394
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.791
Just keep an ear out.
no one will know.

395
00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:48.230
Besides. I'll know if anyone
leaves their room after curfew.

396
00:19:50.232 --> 00:19:52.278
-Really?
-Yeah.

397
00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:54.497
Just a little something
my teacher did to our rooms
back in the day.

398
00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:57.021
'Course. we got around it.

399
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:02.592
Let's just say there was
a sacrificial lamb

with political capital.

401
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.685
-I have no idea
what that means.
-Well. good!

402
00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:11.558
Hey. it's our little secret.
though. right. Mr. My Spy?

403
00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:12.907
Right.

404
00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.660
Is there a liquor store nearby?

00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:47.855
How'd you do?

408
00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:49.509
Pretty good.
We got a problem though.

409
00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:50.379
What?

410
00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.468
Mr. Th-- Oh. Jesus!

411
00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:53.948
Mr. Thompson's gonna know
if we leave.

412
00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:55.428
Said he's gonna do something
to the rooms.

413
00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:57.430
-Like a booby trap?
-I don't know.

414
00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:59.910
-What should we do?
-I mean. not much we can do.

415
00:20:59.997 --> 00:21:02.173
This could be like the most
important night of our lives.

416
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.394
So a little trouble might
just be the price of admission.

417
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:07.353
I guess. Did you find out
where it is?

418
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.137
Oh. yeah. I have a hunch.

419
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:10.704
Yeah? No!

they open that door

438

What do you guys want?

440
00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:11.112
Nothing. just borrowing
some sugar.

441

Well. there's no sugar here.

442
00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:13.854

That's your job.
Which way?

You're ditching Maddy?

00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.123
I mean
about the boobytrap.

536
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.038
[chuckling]
Oh... heh...

537
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:04.911
Uh. we just need
a sacrificial lamb
with political capital.

538
00:26:04.998 --> 00:26:06.477
What the hell's that mean?

539
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.088
Yeah. is that like
a Bible quote or something?

540
00:26:08.175 --> 00:26:09.829
Maddy: It means
you need a fall guy.

541
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:11.831
someone who puts paper
back in everyone's door.

542
00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:13.223
except for theirs.

543
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.703
If they're on
the teacher's good side.

544
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.009
they'll get off
with a warning.

545
00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:18.577
Sacrificial lamb
with political capital.

546
00:26:19.926 --> 00:26:21.275
What she said.

547
00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:22.842
So... who's our lamb?

548
00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:25.105
I'll do it.
Mr. T likes me and Janice.

549
00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:26.541
so we'll get off easy.

550
00:26:26.628 --> 00:26:28.848
Okay. great.
Can we do something now. please?

551
00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:30.414
My fire's dying here.

552
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:31.851
We could play
Truth or Dare.

553
00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:34.462
[Maddy giggling]

554
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:35.942
What's so funny?

555
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:38.205
Uh. nothing.
Nothing. I'm sorry.

556
00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:39.510
It sounds so great.

557
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.425
It's juvenile.

558
00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:43.776
No. it's fun.
I used to play in middle school.

559
00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:45.734
-Me. too.
-Wings: Fine. fine.

560
00:26:45.821 --> 00:26:47.518
Whatever gets
Jessica's fire going.

561
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:48.911
Maddy. truth or dare?

562
00:26:48.998 --> 00:26:50.260
Oh. Truth.

563
00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:52.045
Lame. What base
have you gotten to?

564
00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:53.176
Second.

565
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:57.441
Uh... can you be
a little more specific?

566
00:26:57.528 --> 00:26:59.487
If you ask
specific questions.

567
00:26:59.574 --> 00:27:01.271
Nice. Who's next?

568
00:27:01.358 --> 00:27:03.491
[upbeat music]

569
00:27:31.084 --> 00:27:33.129
All right. Jessica.
Truth or dare?

570
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:34.304
Dare.

571
00:27:34.391 --> 00:27:35.654
Take your shirt off.

572
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.888
Jason.
Truth or dare?

573
00:27:52.975 --> 00:27:55.108
Uh... dare?

574
00:27:55.195 --> 00:27:56.631
Kiss one of the boys.

575
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:58.938
[chuckling]

576
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:01.027
-What?
-Wings: Yeah.

577
00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:02.463
Are you trying to
turn this into some kind
of woke party or something?

578
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.640
Shh! It's my turn.
I can do as I please.

579
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:07.555
Do it. Jason.
I dare you.

580
00:28:07.642 --> 00:28:09.644
Well. wh-who?

581
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:11.907
Hmm...

582
00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:12.908
Kirk.

583
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:14.954
What? No way.

584
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.825
You've hardly
done any dares.

585
00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:18.392
Okay. how 'bout this.

586
00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:20.220
If you two kiss...

587
00:28:20.307 --> 00:28:21.569
then I'll kiss
one of the girls.

588
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:23.397
Deal. You two.
hurry up.

589
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:26.966
Mm.

590
00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:31.622
-Maddy: Aww.
-Jessica: Aww.

591
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.799
Wow... so brave.

592
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.149
So brave.

593
00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:38.281
All right.
restore balance to the Force.

594
00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:55.429
Damn... girls
are pretty.

595
00:28:55.516 --> 00:28:57.213
Duh. Who's next?

596
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:01.652
Maddy.
Truth or dare?

597
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.828
Dare.

598
00:29:02.915 --> 00:29:06.440
I dare you
to kiss Morgan.

599
00:29:06.527 --> 00:29:08.964
Uh. would you mind
picking something else?

600
00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:10.574
W-What. are you a prude
or something?

601
00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:13.012
No. I just don't kiss
unless it's serious.

602
00:29:13.099 --> 00:29:15.188
-Prude.
-It's fine.

603
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:16.842
Just pick
something else.

604
00:29:16.929 --> 00:29:19.540
Okay. How 'bout
you pick two people

605
00:29:19.627 --> 00:29:21.020
to go make out
in that bathroom?

606
00:29:21.107 --> 00:29:22.935
Don't even think about it.

607
00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:25.546
Um. Wings and Yvette.

608
00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:27.940
All right. come on.
That's us. babe.

609
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.594
Katie: Oh!
Get it. girl.

610
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.598
Aww. we don't
get to see? Uhh.

611
00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:35.599
[knock on door.
Jason gasps]

612
00:29:35.686 --> 00:29:36.557
The Feds!

613
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:38.777
[dramatic music]

614
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:44.695
-What the hell. man?
-Code Blue.

615
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:45.653
Ow!

616
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:49.918
[yawning]
Hello?

617
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.528
Can you explain
the meaning of...

618
00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:54.270
Oh. Oh. God. Uh...

619
00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:55.881
I'm sorry.

620
00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:58.797
Uh. I was just
making my rounds. and...

621
00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:01.190
-Were you all asleep?
-Not all of us.

622
00:30:01.277 --> 00:30:02.931
Ah. Yeah.

623
00:30:03.018 --> 00:30:04.628
Uh. I'm sorry.
I just...

624
00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:07.109
Did you ladies open the door
after curfew?

625
00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:09.503
[sleepily]
Did we?

626
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.765
Oh. yeah.

627
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:12.462
There was a cat.

628
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:13.855
A cat?

629
00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:15.422
Yeah. it was meowing
really loud.

630
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:18.599
so we had to...
shoo it away.

631
00:30:18.686 --> 00:30:20.644
It's so hard
to sleep here.

632
00:30:20.731 --> 00:30:24.039
Yeah. my neighbor snores
like a Greek... god.

633
00:30:24.126 --> 00:30:25.954
[yawning]
Oh. my God.

634
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:27.826
That sounds terrible.

635
00:30:27.913 --> 00:30:29.610
[Richard inhales sharply]

636
00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:30.829
Do you wanna come in?

637
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.352
Wh-What?

638
00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:34.310
Maybe we can help
each other sleep somehow.

639
00:30:34.397 --> 00:30:37.226
No! No...
Thank you.

640
00:30:37.313 --> 00:30:39.402
I just remembered
that I have ear plugs.

641
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:41.709
s-so... thank you
for your cooperation.

642
00:30:41.796 --> 00:30:43.015
and good night.

643
00:30:43.102 --> 00:30:44.277
Good night.

644
00:30:49.586 --> 00:30:51.197
[all applaud]

645
00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:57.290
[gentle music]

646
00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:07.996
Wait. Maddy.

647
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:10.651
Let me tell you what.
I should be the Lamb. not you.

648
00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:11.913
Thanks. but. you know.

649
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.219
you haven't been
in trouble yet.

650
00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:14.873
Plus. you do have a record.

651
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.309
Yeah.

652
00:31:19.573 --> 00:31:22.271
I'm sorry that I was
a moron to you earlier.

653
00:31:22.358 --> 00:31:24.404
I was...

654
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:27.102
I was just nervous.
you know. having you there.

655
00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:29.191
but... it made it fun.

656
00:31:31.237 --> 00:31:33.282
You know. before
I lock you guys in.

657
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:34.718
we can go bowling.

658
00:31:34.805 --> 00:31:36.546
[gasps]
Bowling!

659
00:31:37.591 --> 00:31:39.288
I can't.

660
00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:41.421
Mr. T asked me to research
tourist traps for tomorrow.

661
00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:42.726
Wow. he must be desperate.

662
00:31:42.813 --> 00:31:44.772
He's teetering all right.

663
00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:45.947
Good night. boys.

664
00:31:46.034 --> 00:31:47.644
You're a queen among men!

665
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:49.255
[laughs]

666
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:12.278
[cars passing. honking]

667
00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:14.976
All right. keep it moving!
Keep it moving.

668
00:32:15.063 --> 00:32:16.412
This looks good.

669
00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:23.202
Awesome! Breakfast.

670
00:32:23.289 --> 00:32:24.812
We got hash browns?

671
00:32:27.075 --> 00:32:29.121
Hi. Maddie. Morgan.

672
00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:30.774
You got the stuff?

673
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:31.775
What?

674
00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:34.604
You know. the merchandise?

675
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.997
Oh. yeah.

676
00:32:39.696 --> 00:32:41.524
It's cool. She's on our side.

677
00:32:42.873 --> 00:32:44.484
Well. what's the quality?
Good stuff?

678
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:46.355
Well. this ain't
my usual territory.

679
00:32:46.442 --> 00:32:48.140
But it'll do.

680
00:32:48.227 --> 00:32:49.315
I wrote you
some notes in there too
so you should be

681
00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:51.534
flying easy.

682
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.972
Thank you.

683
00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.104
Mr. Thompson:
Impressive.

684
00:32:56.191 --> 00:32:58.759
As usual. it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

685
00:32:58.846 --> 00:33:02.502
Oh. Maddy. did you or Janice
leave your room last night
after curfew?

686
00:33:02.589 --> 00:33:04.460
I went out for some ice. Why?

687
00:33:04.547 --> 00:33:07.550
Oh... no reason.

688
00:33:07.637 --> 00:33:10.031
You know winking is bad. right?

689
00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:11.467
Enjoy your meal.

690
00:33:11.554 --> 00:33:12.816
[Maddy chuckles]

691
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:15.950
Okay. everybody.

692
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:18.822
If you exist. pay attention.

693
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:20.433
Janice?

694
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.046
While we're
waiting for the bus.

695
00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:27.396
I have something very special
planned for us today.

696
00:33:27.483 --> 00:33:29.616
But the competition
starts today.

697
00:33:29.703 --> 00:33:31.661
The judged performance
is not until the afternoon.

698
00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:33.054
so until then...

699
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.838
But meet-and-greet starts
in 20 minutes.

700
00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:36.318
so we'll definitely
miss that.

701
00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:38.146
Yes. but there's nothing
we can do about that now.

702
00:33:38.233 --> 00:33:40.322
So let's try to have some fun!

703
00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:41.323
Like how?

704
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.195
Oh. you'll see.

705
00:33:43.282 --> 00:33:45.458
After breakfast.
we'll take some Ubers

706
00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:48.504
to a super-secret
sightseeing destination.

707
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:49.592
What is it?

708
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.203
It's a secret.

709
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.509
Which should be very
interesting and educational.

710
00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:54.858
Sounds lame.

711
00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:57.818
Oh. I promise you
it is not lame.

712
00:33:57.905 --> 00:33:59.950
The Pennyfeather House--

713
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.909
Or the Pennyfeather Farmhouse.

714
00:34:01.996 --> 00:34:03.693
as it was sometimes
referred to--

715
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.957
was commissioned by famous
doily pioneer

716
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.264
Fanny Mae Pennyfeather

717
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:11.266
in 1896.

718
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:13.529
and designed later that year

719
00:34:13.616 --> 00:34:16.793
by architect
Phineas T. Book III.

720
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.753
Now. because of a particularly
harsh winter.

721
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.583
construction was delayed
until the following year of...

722
00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.237
1897.

723
00:34:25.324 --> 00:34:27.674
Once the house was completed.

724
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:30.851
Mrs. Pennyfeather became
quite the talk of the town.

725
00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:33.419
because of her wonderful
dinner parties.

726
00:34:33.506 --> 00:34:35.595
orange grove soirees.

727
00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:37.858
and her garden.
where she grew

728
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:40.600
onions. turnips. and...

729
00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:42.863
figs.

730
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.779
Now. before I release you
on the neighborhood to
explore for yourselves.

731
00:34:45.866 --> 00:34:49.304
does anyone have any questions
on the Pennyfeather House?

732
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.400
Uh. didn't Arthur Plowland--

733
00:34:58.487 --> 00:34:59.923
"Plowland"--

734
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.970
uh. famous criminal.
once come to town?

735
00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:05.407
Uh... Yes. Yes!

736
00:35:05.494 --> 00:35:08.193
He was a very famous
cattle thief

737
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.848
who settled down here
to sell cattle of his own.

738
00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:14.503
Ah...

739
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.288
Yeah.

740
00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:17.854
Uh...

741
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:21.162
Wasn't there a particularly
harsh winter?

742
00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:22.990
-No. you said that.
-Ma'am.

743
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:26.167
didn't people back then
shoot each other?

744
00:35:26.254 --> 00:35:28.430
Uh. yup. I suppose they did.

745
00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:30.606
Wasn't it also common
that the townsfolk

746
00:35:30.693 --> 00:35:32.869
would just totally
slaughter each other?

747
00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:34.480
Well.

748
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:37.047
this town outlawed firearms
pretty early on.

749
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:41.313
so there aren't any shootings
that we know about.

750
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.228
-What about pitchforks?
-Don't think so.

751
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:47.101
Okay. uh. anyone else
have any other questions?

752
00:35:47.188 --> 00:35:50.844
-Is the bus fixed yet?
-About the house.

753
00:35:50.931 --> 00:35:52.367
No?

754
00:35:52.454 --> 00:35:54.108
Okay. well. how about
a round of applause

755
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:56.676
for the lovely... Stephanie.

756
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.723
Thank you. everyone.

757
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.596
If you have any further
questions. I will be...

758
00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:06.860
you know. here.

759
00:36:06.947 --> 00:36:09.993
All right.
Go. scram. explore!

760
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.170
Learn.

761
00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:14.737
Mr. T. I was looking here.

762
00:36:14.824 --> 00:36:17.349
and it seems like
we're gonna be missing
the music exchange next.

763
00:36:17.436 --> 00:36:19.089
-and I thought maybe--
-Wayne. Wayne!

764
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.091
I'm expecting a call
from the bus any second.

765
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.050
so why don't you
go ahead and relax.

766
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:24.617
-Okay?
-Do you have reception?

767
00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:27.707
Yes. I have perfect service.

768
00:36:27.794 --> 00:36:29.796
No. actually it's not that good.

769
00:36:29.883 --> 00:36:31.537
But I'm gonna go find some.
okay?

770
00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:33.843
So why don't you go ahead
and scram. learn.

771
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.975
Okay.

772
00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:40.589
Excuse me.

773
00:36:45.028 --> 00:36:47.944
[playful shouting]

774
00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:53.646
Maddy: Wow. he does
look desperate.

775
00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:56.039
-Poor guy.
-Hey. what are these. shakes?

776
00:36:56.126 --> 00:36:57.519
Snack shack.

777
00:36:58.955 --> 00:37:00.522
If we don't make our judge
performance.

778
00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:02.045
we'll have to forfeit.

779
00:37:02.132 --> 00:37:04.178
Whatever. I just hope
we don't have to stay

780
00:37:04.265 --> 00:37:05.527
in that dump
another night.

781
00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:08.051
Why? You didn't like your kiss?

782
00:37:08.138 --> 00:37:09.879
Well. if we are
stranded again.

783
00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:11.881
all that's left for tomorrow
is the exhibition performance.

784
00:37:11.968 --> 00:37:14.232
the awards.
and the goodbye dance.

785
00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:16.495
After that.
the whole trip's a bust.

786
00:37:16.582 --> 00:37:18.932
No fancy hotels.

787
00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:20.716
no beaches.

788
00:37:20.803 --> 00:37:22.065
It sucks.

789
00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:27.245
And how many seats
does it have?

790
00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:31.161
Okay. you have
anything smaller?

791
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.730
[scoffs] Okay. how much
for the big one?

792
00:37:34.817 --> 00:37:37.080
Per day?

793
00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:39.126
Hey. teacher's pet?

794
00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:40.780
Why don't you go get. uh.

795
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.738
Mr. T and Ranger Chick
together?

796
00:37:42.825 --> 00:37:44.262
Why?

797
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:46.046
Because it'll get us
unsupervised tonight.

798
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:47.439
Go get 'em together.

799
00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:48.918
Dude. look at him.
he's freaking out!

800
00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:51.356
Exactly.
it'll cheer him up.

801
00:37:51.443 --> 00:37:54.184
Plus. gets him out of our hair.

802
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:57.492
What am I supposed to say?

803
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.929
Oh. you guys are so pathetic.

804
00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:11.811
Oh. hi there.
Do you have a question?

805
00:38:11.898 --> 00:38:13.726
Um. no. sorry.

806
00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:17.120
Actually. I hope this isn't
too forward or anything.

807
00:38:17.207 --> 00:38:19.993
but I was just curious
if you were single.

808
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.735
'cause Mr. Thompson is. so...

809
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:25.390
Oh. [chuckles]
that is forward.

810
00:38:25.477 --> 00:38:27.261
Yeah. I'm sorry.

811
00:38:27.348 --> 00:38:30.090
Um. it's just that. you know.
he's such a great guy.

812
00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:32.919
and he's been really sad since
he and his wife split.

813
00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:34.660
so we've been trying
to cheer him up.

814
00:38:34.747 --> 00:38:36.836
as he's had such a big impact
on all our lives.

815
00:38:36.923 --> 00:38:38.968
Oh. wow. Really?

816
00:38:39.055 --> 00:38:42.145
Yeah. he basically talked
a bunch of us out of suicide.

817
00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:43.799
Aww.

818
00:38:56.986 --> 00:38:59.815
You know. your girlfriend's
pretty cool.

819
00:38:59.902 --> 00:39:01.774
We're just friends.

820
00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:04.124
That's probably 'cause
you don't talk to her.

821
00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:08.215
Hello?

822
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.656
Hello?

823
00:39:14.743 --> 00:39:16.092
Shit.

824
00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:20.532
Hey! No climbing on the walls!

825
00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:22.055
Oh!

826
00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:24.231
Oh. jeez. Sorry.
I'm just...

827
00:39:24.318 --> 00:39:26.712
Man. man. I'm just kidding.
Don't worry about it.

828
00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:29.845
I'm sorry. you look busy.
You busy?

829
00:39:29.932 --> 00:39:31.804
-You're busy.
-No. No. me?

830
00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:33.719
No. just working out some...

831
00:39:33.806 --> 00:39:35.851
transportation issues.

832
00:39:35.938 --> 00:39:38.680
Say. you don't have a cheap
way to get to the coast.

833
00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:39.855
do you?

834
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:41.727
For all of you?

835
00:39:41.814 --> 00:39:44.033
I don't know what to tell ya.
man. it's a really rural town.

836
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.471
There's not a lot of options.

837
00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:48.777
Are you trying
to leave today.

838
00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:51.432
or are you sticking
around tonight?

839
00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:52.781
Uh. I hope not.

840
00:39:52.868 --> 00:39:55.001
It really depends if this
stupid bus calls.

841
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:57.438
We're missing this big
international competition thing.

842
00:39:57.525 --> 00:39:58.700
Oh. when is it?

843
00:39:58.787 --> 00:40:00.223
Now.

844
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.747
Now. We're missing it now.

845
00:40:01.834 --> 00:40:03.966
Oh. bummer.

846
00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:06.708
Oh. man. I would take you
in my R.V..

847
00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:09.755
but it is tiny
and full of junk.

848
00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:12.714
Is it like a history
competition?

849
00:40:12.801 --> 00:40:14.281
No. band!
[laughs]

850
00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:15.674
Yeah. I'm in a--

851
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:18.111
they're in a
jazz school band.

852
00:40:18.198 --> 00:40:19.895
Oh. you're a band teacher.

853
00:40:19.982 --> 00:40:22.158
Well. technically.
but it's just a temp gig

854
00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:24.465
until my band kicks off.

855
00:40:24.552 --> 00:40:26.293
You know. my adult band.

856
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.338
Rad. That is so awesome.

857
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.863
You are so awesome.

858
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.779
So. if your stupid bus
doesn't call.

859
00:40:33.866 --> 00:40:37.304
we should. uh. go get
a drink or something.

860
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:38.610
A drink with you?

861
00:40:38.697 --> 00:40:40.916
Uh. wow. All right.

862
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:43.745
Yeah. that would--
drinks would be rad.

863
00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:45.399
-Totally.
-[laughs]

864
00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:47.096
Uh. I should ask you
for your number.

865
00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:49.664
Oh. yeah. here.
let me type it in for you.

866
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:50.839
[nervous laugh]

867
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.583
[camera shutter clicks]

868
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.976
So you don't forget me.

869
00:40:57.063 --> 00:40:59.413
Oh. yeah.
No. I won't. Never.

870
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.415
Well. good luck with
your stupid bus.

871
00:41:01.502 --> 00:41:02.982
Thanks. Fingers crossed.

872
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:05.201
-Yeah.
-But not too crossed.

873
00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:07.203
'Cause. uh. drinks.

874
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.291
-Drinks!
-Drinks!

875
00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:09.728
[laughs] Yeah.

876
00:41:09.815 --> 00:41:12.295
-Yeah. thanks.
-Yeah.

877
00:41:28.703 --> 00:41:31.053
So. how did you get so good
and hooking people up?

878
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.447
I don't know.
I just introduce people

879
00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:36.015
and it usually works out.

880
00:41:36.102 --> 00:41:38.191
So. who would you
introduce me to?

881
00:41:38.278 --> 00:41:39.584
Who do you want?

882
00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:41.455
I don't know.

883
00:41:41.542 --> 00:41:43.196
[sniffs]

884
00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:51.813
So. uh. how did you
get into stargazing?

885
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.423
Well.

886
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.077
there was this guy.

887
00:41:55.164 --> 00:41:57.123
Wait a minute.
Hold on. hold on.

888
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:58.864
[laughs] I gotta hear this.

889
00:41:58.951 --> 00:42:00.605
Okay.

890
00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:01.954
-So. I was a Freshman.
-Mm-hmm.

891
00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:04.173
and he was a Sophomore.

892
00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.045
and. like. we never really
went to my place

893
00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:07.437
because of my parents.

894
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.178
and his were always fighting.

895
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:12.268
So. we'd go wander around
downtown.

896
00:42:12.355 --> 00:42:14.967
or go hang out
on the playground.

897
00:42:15.054 --> 00:42:18.057
and we'd also lie there
looking up at the stars.

898
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.625
And that's when I would imagine
that we were married

899
00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:23.758
and falling asleep
in our own house.

900
00:42:23.845 --> 00:42:25.847
Anyways.
I-I've been looking up

901
00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:27.545
ever-- ever since.

902
00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:29.068
Hmm.

903
00:42:31.026 --> 00:42:32.724
That's lovely.

904
00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:36.728
You ever...

905
00:42:36.815 --> 00:42:39.731
look up there and see a
bunch of mythical creatures

906
00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:42.516
all united. fighting against
the forces of evil?

907
00:42:42.603 --> 00:42:44.649
What are you talking about?

908
00:42:44.736 --> 00:42:46.564
You know how you're
always asking about

909
00:42:46.651 --> 00:42:48.130
me and Jason's
stupid handshake?

910
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:49.697
Mm-hmm.

911
00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:51.220
Well. this is
what it's from.

912
00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:52.918
Oh. okay. Okay. Hold on.

913
00:42:53.005 --> 00:42:54.484
-Okay. let's go.
-Yeah.

914
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:55.703
-Okay. go.
-Okay.

915
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.400
[sighs]

916
00:42:57.487 --> 00:42:59.707
So. when I was growing up.
there was this TV show

917
00:42:59.794 --> 00:43:02.362
called The Intergalactic
Friendship Alliance.

918
00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:05.452
Wait. wait. wait.
The cartoon show for kids?

919
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:08.847
Kids. nothing. No. this was
ice cold adult storytelling.

920
00:43:08.934 --> 00:43:11.240
A long time ago. there
were all these mythic beings.

921
00:43:11.327 --> 00:43:13.895
like dragons. unicorns.
pegasi. right?

922
00:43:13.982 --> 00:43:15.767
-Mm-hmm.
-But they had to leave Earth

923
00:43:15.854 --> 00:43:18.030
when mankind became
too warlike.

924
00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:20.815
So they scattered all
throughout the universe

925
00:43:20.902 --> 00:43:22.425
met all these aliens.

926
00:43:22.512 --> 00:43:25.211
and formed the Intergalactic
Friendship Alliance.

927
00:43:25.298 --> 00:43:28.083
[laughs] That doesn't
sound very adult.

928
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.695
Well. the Alliance is always
sending out these invitations.

929
00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:32.392
which are these. um.

930
00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:34.176
pearlescent. glowing.
magical orbs

931
00:43:34.263 --> 00:43:35.264
called friendship pearls--

932
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:36.701
Friendship pearls?

933
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:38.833
That they fling
across the universe.

934
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.835
hoping that they'll be found
by other beings

935
00:43:40.922 --> 00:43:42.141
worthy enough
to join them.

936
00:43:42.228 --> 00:43:43.664
-Okay.
-Okay.

937
00:43:43.751 --> 00:43:45.492
legend has it that Earth

938
00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:47.450
has already received
its friendship pearl.

939
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:50.236
but we haven't found it yet.
because we're still not worthy.

940
00:43:50.323 --> 00:43:52.542
So. someday.

941
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.893
someone who's receptive
to its peaceful.

942
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.590
harmonious vibrations

943
00:43:56.677 --> 00:43:58.592
will discover the pearl.

944
00:43:58.679 --> 00:44:00.376
place their hand on it--

945
00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:01.726
Whoosh!

946
00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:03.858
Earth will finally
be able to join

947
00:44:03.945 --> 00:44:05.686
the Intergalactic Friendship
Alliance.

948
00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.993
redeeming all of mankind

949
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.560
and swearing to fight
for peace. justice.

950
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:13.389
and understanding
throughout the universe.

951
00:44:13.476 --> 00:44:16.784
Wow. that is the geekiest thing
I've ever heard.

952
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:18.003
Yeah.

953
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.353
But I kind of like
how you tell it.

954
00:44:22.007 --> 00:44:24.009
Anyway. our. uh.

955
00:44:24.096 --> 00:44:25.924
our handshake is from
the theme song.

956
00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:27.708
And Jason and I

957
00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:30.102
used to search the entire
neighborhood

958
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:32.191
for the friendship pearl.

959
00:44:33.627 --> 00:44:35.629
And the show's got
rainbow-throwing dragon ponies.

960
00:44:35.716 --> 00:44:37.631
which is actually pretty dope.

961
00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:40.678
I've never seen anything
like that in the stars.

962
00:44:40.765 --> 00:44:43.245
but I'd like to.
Maybe one day.

963
00:44:43.332 --> 00:44:44.725
Well.

964
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:46.161
if we're still
stuck here tonight.

965
00:44:46.248 --> 00:44:48.294
maybe we could go "bowling"

966
00:44:48.381 --> 00:44:49.948
for friendship pearls.

967
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:52.037
That sounds lovely.

968
00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:55.997
There you guys are!

969
00:44:56.084 --> 00:44:57.129
Come on. we're leaving.

970
00:44:57.216 --> 00:44:58.391
Where?

971
00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:03.483
[cars passing. horns honking]

972
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:08.053
[rhythmic tapping]

973
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.317
-What about tomorrow?
-Doesn't look good. guys.

974
00:45:11.404 --> 00:45:13.798
Bus is in bad shape.

975
00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:15.234
I'm sorry.

976
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:17.453
They can't send
a replacement?

977
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.020
Everything's booked.

978
00:45:19.107 --> 00:45:22.197
They said they'd call
if something opens up.

979
00:45:22.284 --> 00:45:24.373
Would it help if we
used our phones

980
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.810
to research taxis

981
00:45:25.897 --> 00:45:27.420
or other forms
of public transportation?

982
00:45:27.507 --> 00:45:31.293
Thanks. but we can barely
afford to stay here.

983
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.208
[sighs]
Look guys. I'm sorry.

984
00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.254
I've tried
everything.

985
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:36.777
The only thing we can
really do now

986
00:45:36.864 --> 00:45:38.431
is just hang out.

987
00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:40.172
Try to make the best
of it. okay?

988
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.565
We could call our parents
and ask them to donate money

989
00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:44.263
for Ubers or taxis.

990
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.612
-then tomorrow we could--
-Wayne--Wayne!

991
00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:47.614
We don't have time.

992
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:49.790
Look. I'm sorry.

993
00:45:49.877 --> 00:45:52.097
I'm as bummed as you
guys are. okay?

994
00:45:52.184 --> 00:45:54.447
But I've experienced a lot
of frustration in my life.

995
00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:57.493
and I'm telling you.
it's all about how you react.

996
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.496
Janice. will you stop drumming
for one goddamn second?

997
00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:04.587
[sighs]

998
00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:08.461
You guys should practice
not giving a shit.

999
00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:11.769
'Cause sometimes
life is shitty.

1000
00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:13.683
And sometimes the
only thing you can do

1001
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.643
is pull on your big boy
pants and cope.

1002
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.297
So we're here.
we exist here.

1003
00:46:18.384 --> 00:46:19.951
So deal with it.

1004
00:46:20.038 --> 00:46:22.823
It's like...
you're quitting on us.

1005
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.608
I'm not quitting
on you. I--

1006
00:46:27.045 --> 00:46:30.526
Look. just hang out
here tonight.

1007
00:46:30.613 --> 00:46:33.355
When the bus is fixed.
we'll go home.

1008
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:38.099
[deep sigh]

1009
00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:40.754
If anyone needs me.
I'll be in my room.

1010
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:42.930
not quitting on you.

1011
00:46:43.017 --> 00:46:44.758
When's curfew?

1012
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:15.006
[cars whizzing past]

1013
00:48:29.602 --> 00:48:31.517
Hey. Morgan.

1014
00:48:31.604 --> 00:48:33.127
Hey.

1015
00:48:33.214 --> 00:48:34.912
Pretty lousy night. huh?

1016
00:48:36.087 --> 00:48:38.002
Yeah.

1017
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:41.135
I was really looking forward
to the music exchange.

1018
00:48:41.222 --> 00:48:42.876
the dance.

1019
00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:44.399
You dance?

1020
00:48:44.486 --> 00:48:46.140
Uh. like.

1021
00:48:46.227 --> 00:48:47.925
geeky dancing

1022
00:48:48.012 --> 00:48:49.143
to be funny.

1023
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.015
Oh. cool.

1024
00:48:56.237 --> 00:48:57.586
[Morgan exhales sharply]

1025
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:03.418
So. uh. where is everyone?

1026
00:49:03.505 --> 00:49:05.464
You mean Wings?

1027
00:49:05.551 --> 00:49:07.596
No. I...

1028
00:49:07.683 --> 00:49:09.076
We got in a fight.

1029
00:49:10.164 --> 00:49:12.166
Oh. I'm sorry.

1030
00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:16.779
Well. we've never been
super official.

1031
00:49:16.866 --> 00:49:20.783
That's why he's always kind
of done whatever he wants.

1032
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:24.657
But these last few days
on this trip.

1033
00:49:24.744 --> 00:49:27.051
he's just been acting
so much more

1034
00:49:27.138 --> 00:49:28.835
I don't know...

1035
00:49:29.879 --> 00:49:31.185
Douchey?

1036
00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:32.491
[chuckles] Yeah.

1037
00:49:32.578 --> 00:49:34.275
More than usual.

1038
00:49:34.362 --> 00:49:36.234
He's been trying to get
this second party going.

1039
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:38.845
He wants it to be hot
or something.

1040
00:49:38.932 --> 00:49:40.020
I don't know.

1041
00:49:40.107 --> 00:49:41.804
It's just too much
right now.

1042
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:43.197
Yeah.

1043
00:49:43.284 --> 00:49:46.331
Sometimes you just
wanna chill.

1044
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.465
So. are you coming in.

1045
00:49:50.552 --> 00:49:51.379
or..?

1046
00:49:51.466 --> 00:49:52.641
[nervous laugh]

1047
00:49:52.728 --> 00:49:54.165
I-I don't even have
my swimsuit.

1048
00:49:54.252 --> 00:49:56.123
That's okay.

1049
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.646
Uh...

1050
00:49:58.952 --> 00:50:01.607
Underwear is basically
a swimsuit. right?

1051
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:11.051
[giggles]

1052
00:50:41.777 --> 00:50:43.170
You did it!

1053
00:50:43.257 --> 00:50:45.172
-I did it!
-[laughs]

1054
00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:51.048
You know. I can't picture
you dancing like a geek.

1055
00:50:51.135 --> 00:50:53.441
No?

1056
00:50:53.528 --> 00:50:55.835
No. you're always
acting so serious.

1057
00:50:55.922 --> 00:50:57.054
all the time.

1058
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:58.490
Really?

1059
00:51:00.709 --> 00:51:01.884
Huh.

1060
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.932
I guess I have funny ideas.
I just don't...

1061
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:07.281
let them out.

1062
00:51:07.368 --> 00:51:09.370
You should!
Tell me a joke.

1063
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.806
[laughs]

1064
00:51:10.893 --> 00:51:13.200
No. I-I can't do that.

1065
00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:16.029
Okay. uh.
show me your moves.

1066
00:51:16.116 --> 00:51:17.552
That's even worse!

1067
00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:19.467
Come on! Okay.
I'll do it with you.

1068
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:21.078
-Really?
-Really.

1069
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:23.558
Okay. uh...

1070
00:51:23.645 --> 00:51:25.082
-On three?
-On three.

1071
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:27.258
-Okay.
-One...

1072
00:51:27.345 --> 00:51:29.390
-Two.
-Two.

1073
00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:31.305
-Three.
-Three.

1074
00:51:40.967 --> 00:51:43.012
[laughing]

1075
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.972
See. you should let your
geek out more often.

1076
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:48.017
Yeah. right.

1077
00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:52.544
You think so?

1078
00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:53.936
Definitely.

1079
00:51:58.071 --> 00:51:59.942
Hey. look. it's Maddy.

1080
00:52:03.729 --> 00:52:05.383
[knocking]

1081
00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:10.779
Is she... looking for you?

1082
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:13.652
I don't know. Maybe.

1083
00:52:26.926 --> 00:52:30.669
You know. I always thought
Maddy was super serious too.

1084
00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:33.976
But she's actually
pretty cool.

1085
00:52:34.063 --> 00:52:35.761
You ever thought
about asking her out?

1086
00:52:37.023 --> 00:52:38.894
No. we're just friends.

1087
00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:40.418
Mm-hmm.

1088
00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:42.159
[gate clangs]

1089
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:48.600
Hey. uh. I was thinking
about going stargazing.

1090
00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:50.602
You guys wanna come?

1091
00:52:50.689 --> 00:52:51.864
Ooh. stargazing!

1092
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:53.648
You ever seen the show
Cosmos?

1093
00:52:53.735 --> 00:52:55.868
Yeah! It's amazing.

1094
00:52:55.955 --> 00:52:58.000
Um... anyway...

1095
00:52:58.087 --> 00:53:01.178
I was hoping to spot
a friendship pearl.

1096
00:53:01.265 --> 00:53:03.484
What's a friendship pearl?

1097
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:09.142
It's a kind of meteor.
They're quite rare.

1098
00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:11.318
Oh. cool.

1099
00:53:11.405 --> 00:53:14.103
I think I'm just gonna hang
here tonight. Thanks. though.

1100
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.716
Oh. no worries.
Morgan. do you wanna come?

1101
00:53:17.803 --> 00:53:19.848
Uh...

1102
00:53:19.935 --> 00:53:21.502
yeah. that sounds fun.

1103
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:22.547
Yvette?!

1104
00:53:22.634 --> 00:53:23.896
What?

1105
00:53:23.983 --> 00:53:26.115
Come up here!
We're getting started!

1106
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.248
No thanks. I'm just
gonna chill here.

1107
00:53:28.335 --> 00:53:31.077
Come on! I'm not gonna
have any fun without you.

1108
00:53:31.164 --> 00:53:32.513
Please?!

1109
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.167
Man: Hey! Some of us
are trying to sleep!

1110
00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:35.908
Shut up. dude. nobody's
talking to you.

1111
00:53:35.995 --> 00:53:37.953
Man: You little punks
got no respect.

1112
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.042
Come up here if you
want some respect!

1113
00:53:40.129 --> 00:53:42.915
Yvette. come on!
Seriously. get up here.

1114
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:50.096
Well. I guess
I'll be seeing ya.

1115
00:53:50.183 --> 00:53:51.576
Unless you guys
wanna come with?

1116
00:53:51.663 --> 00:53:54.013
Maddie. you made it
so fun last time.

1117
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.102
Thanks. but I'm okay.

1118
00:53:56.189 --> 00:53:57.364
Have fun though.

1119
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:59.714
Okay. sounds good. See you.

1120
00:54:07.287 --> 00:54:08.723
I'll go.

1121
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.247
Yeah?

1122
00:54:10.334 --> 00:54:12.249
Okay. see you up there.

1123
00:54:15.426 --> 00:54:16.644
[sighs]

1124
00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:19.647
[gate clangs shut]

1125
00:54:20.953 --> 00:54:22.694
I'm sorry. I-

1126
00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:25.262
Can we just go another time?

1127
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:26.350
[sighs]

1128
00:54:26.437 --> 00:54:27.612
Okay.

1129
00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:30.092
It's-- It's not that
I don't want to.

1130
00:54:30.179 --> 00:54:31.616
It's just. like...

1131
00:54:31.703 --> 00:54:33.357
I just want to be around
more people right now.

1132
00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:34.923
You know?

1133
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.403
You can--
You can come too.

1134
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.710
That stuff's not for me.

1135
00:54:39.711 --> 00:54:41.843
You can go. though.
I'll be fine.

1136
00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:46.326
It's not like
I don't like you.

1137
00:54:46.413 --> 00:54:48.067
I know.

1138
00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:51.157
I just...

1139
00:54:53.072 --> 00:54:54.769
I don't want to miss out.

1140
00:54:54.856 --> 00:54:56.423
But you'll have
other opportunities.

1141
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.120
Yeah. but not right now.

1142
00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:04.170
Well...

1143
00:55:04.257 --> 00:55:06.607
you better get going then.

1144
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:25.713
[sighs]

1145
00:55:27.019 --> 00:55:28.716
[knocking]

1146
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:31.806
Hey!

1147
00:55:31.893 --> 00:55:33.199
What's up. teacher's pet?

1148
00:55:33.286 --> 00:55:34.853
Where's your girlfriend?

1149
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:38.639
No. no. no. no.
We're already uneven.

1150
00:55:38.726 --> 00:55:39.988
It's okay. I invited him.

1151
00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:42.600
I say what's okay.

1152
00:55:42.687 --> 00:55:44.602
Now. vamoose.

1153
00:55:46.299 --> 00:55:47.518
Oh. there she is.

1154
00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:49.737
All right. come on.

1155
00:55:49.824 --> 00:55:51.260
[whispers]
What are you doing?

1156
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:52.392
You're not ready
for this stuff.

1157
00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:54.394
[whispers]
Neither are you.

1158
00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:02.315
So. what did we miss?

1159
00:56:02.402 --> 00:56:03.882
Not much.

1160
00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:05.318
As you can see.

1161
00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:06.885
You guys wanna play
truth or dare again?

1162
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:08.190
-That was fun.
-No.

1163
00:56:08.277 --> 00:56:09.627
Enough kid stuff.

1164
00:56:09.714 --> 00:56:11.324
Tonight is the real deal.

1165
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:12.760
So how about it. prude?

1166
00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:14.109
You in a kissing
mood tonight?

1167
00:56:14.196 --> 00:56:15.241
Guess we'll see.

1168
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.851
Well. guess again.

1169
00:56:16.938 --> 00:56:18.940
If you don't kiss.
you don't stay.

1170
00:56:19.027 --> 00:56:20.942
So. who's it gonna be?

1171
00:56:27.558 --> 00:56:29.647
Close enough.
All right. who else?

1172
00:56:32.519 --> 00:56:34.826
Actually. you two save
that for later

1173
00:56:34.913 --> 00:56:36.871
so I don't have to see it.

1174
00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:38.612
Wings. this is dumb.

1175
00:56:38.699 --> 00:56:40.135
Y'all are making it dumb.

1176
00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:42.660
Why am I the only one
coming up with stuff?

1177
00:56:42.747 --> 00:56:44.313
Somebody do something.

1178
00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:48.579
Touché.

1179
00:57:06.292 --> 00:57:08.773
[kissing noises]

1180
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.949
Why is everybody
just sitting there?

1181
00:57:11.036 --> 00:57:13.299
Either do something
or get out.

1182
00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:21.438
[door opens]

1183
00:57:27.313 --> 00:57:29.010
[door closes]

1184
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:30.272
Hey. Yvette.

1185
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:31.883
Maddie looks
a little nervous.

1186
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.928
Maybe help her out.

1187
00:57:34.015 --> 00:57:36.104
I don't think
she wants to.

1188
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:37.628
Fine.

1189
00:57:37.715 --> 00:57:39.412
Let her sit there and stare
like a weirdo.

1190
00:57:39.499 --> 00:57:41.153
Leave her alone.

1191
00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:37.601
[door opens. closes]

1192
00:58:37.688 --> 00:58:39.298
[scoffs]
Bunch of downers. man.

1193
00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:41.126
Y'all do what you want.

1194
00:58:41.213 --> 00:58:42.736
Come on.

1195
00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:44.999
[sharp exhale]

1196
00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:46.305
By the way.

1197
00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:48.263
she likes it when
you touch her neck.

1198
00:58:49.656 --> 00:58:51.005
[sighs]

1199
00:58:51.963 --> 00:58:53.268
[door closes]

1200
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:56.968
[rhythmic drumming]

1201
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.631
[door opens]

1202
00:59:08.806 --> 00:59:10.068
[door closes]

1203
00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:11.939
I think I messed up.

1204
00:59:13.071 --> 00:59:15.552
She'll be okay.

1205
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.466
Just give her time.

1206
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.120
It'll be all right.

1207
00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:21.601
I don't know.

1208
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.867
It will be.

1209
00:59:26.954 --> 00:59:28.608
Eventually.

1210
00:59:29.653 --> 00:59:31.089
You'll see.

1211
00:59:36.398 --> 00:59:38.096
Wings:
What's up. love nerds?

1212
00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:39.663
Y'all taking a breather?

1213
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.143
Us too.

1214
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.102
All right. well we're
gonna go get some drinks.

1215
00:59:44.189 --> 00:59:46.670
but. uh.
we'll smell you later.

1216
01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:17.135
[wistful music]

1217
01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:15.933
[Yvette chuckles softly]

1218
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.503
-Oh.
-[Yvette giggles]

1219
01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:37.171
[Yvette chuckles]

1220
01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:07.158
Sorry.

1221
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.118
Don't be.
Always so serious.

1222

[beeping.

1223

Hey! What's up.
love nerds?

1224
01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.959
Oh. Oh. no.

1225
01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:27.613
I didn't...

1226
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.746
May I come in?

1227
01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.096
Hey. good job.
teacher's pet.

1228
01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.358
Good job.

1229
01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.056
Come on. man.

1230
01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:37.623
I'm not gonna hit you.

1231
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.845
I'm happy for you.

1232
01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:42.846
[chuckles softly]

1233
01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.586
She's pretty good. right?

1234
01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:46.675
[chuckles]

1235
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.418
All right. well.
if you'll excuse me...

1236
01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:55.162
I think I've had
a little too much...

1237
01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:57.208
-to drink!
-[bathroom door shuts]

1238
01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:00.211
[muffled]
Whoo!

1239
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:05.259
[Wings mutters indistinctly]

1240
01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:08.132
I won't tell anyone.

1241
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:14.355
Wings: Hey! Did you guys
have fun tonight?

1242
01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:16.531
You look really cute.

1243
01:03:16.618 --> 01:03:19.665
Morgan. I believe it. Ha!

1244
01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.014
I think I should go.

1245
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:23.147
[chuckles]
Definitely.

1246
01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:26.280
[Wings continues
muttering incoherently]

1247
01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:31.677
Wings: Hey...

1248
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:37.639
Wings: I'll be through.

Let's at least fix
that bedhead.

1424
01:13:12.823 --> 01:13:14.085
I'm not goin' in there.

[sighs]

1426
01:13:17.828 --> 01:13:19.395
I just came
to catch the bus.

1427
01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:20.613
Dude. I don't care
what you look like.

1428
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.354
but you're gonna
dance with me.

1429
01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:25.618
What about Maddy?

1430
01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:29.317
You realize you two are perfect
for each other. right?

1431
01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.276
[scoffs]

1432
01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:33.496
[scoffs]
Okay. fine.

1433
01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:34.975
Go be sad.

1434
01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:38.065
I'll grow up tomorrow.

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:44.420
Oh.

[muffled music]

1441
01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:21.674
Are you the band
that didn't show up

1442
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:22.849
for any of your
performances?

1443
01:14:22.936 --> 01:14:24.155
That's us.

1444
01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:26.287
Everyone's calling you
The Forfeiteers.

1445
01:14:26.374 --> 01:14:27.463
'Cause you... forfeit.

1446
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.856
"Forfeiteers."

1447
01:14:29.943 --> 01:14:31.423
You know. I like that.

1448
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.338
Is it true you came here
in a Winnebago?

1449
01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:36.341
Is it true that all Australians
ride to school on kangaroos?

1450
01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:38.952
Is it true that all Americans
wear body armor to school?

1451
01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:41.999
Yeah. but... it only
stops small arms fire.

1452
01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:47.004
Thought not.

1453
01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:48.614
Yeah. but I just got you
to touch my pec.

1454

[both giggle]

1455
01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:55.621
Um... g'day me
a minute?

Good evening. Madam Maddy.

up off the wall?

and whooping]

1460
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:12.856
Look...

1461
01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:16.294
Morgan. he's just going through
some stuff right now.

1462
01:15:16.381 --> 01:15:17.861
I'm sure if you went
and talked to him--

1463
01:15:17.948 --> 01:15:20.254
I'm done
trying to help him.

1464
01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:23.475
If he wants something.
he can say so.

1465

really good on you.

1468
01:15:48.805 --> 01:15:50.633
Oh. thanks.

1469

Wings: Hey. teacher's pet!
What's up. man?

1470
01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:55.115
Hey. what's wrong?

1471
01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:56.334
Somethin' botherin' you?

1472
01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.076
Is it girl trouble?

1473
01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:02.340
Which one is it?
Is it... prude?

1474
01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:04.516
Or Yvette?
Because I'm confused.

1475
01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:05.604
Hey!

1476
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.999
Don't worry.
I'm not mad.

1477
01:16:10.261 --> 01:16:12.219
I know Yvette
didn't leave me for you.

1478
01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:15.527
In fact. I'm feelin'
so generous.

1479
01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:16.702
I'll even help you
get with her.

1480
01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:17.964
I don't need your help.

1481
01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:19.662
Hey. the only reason
that you

1482
01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:21.577
even have a chance now
is because of me.

1483
01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:22.969
'Cause you're
an asshole.

1484
01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:24.971
Be careful.

1485
01:16:25.058 --> 01:16:26.669
There's a lady.

1486
01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:29.236
All right? I can tell
that you're a little grumpy...

1487
01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:31.978
so let's just
pick this up later.

1488
01:16:32.065 --> 01:16:34.894
Oh. and. uh. if Mr. T
comes looking for us.

1489
01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.200
make up an excuse.
would you?

1490
01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:37.375
Make your own.

1491
01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:41.597
I'm sorry.

1492
01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:42.946
I thought
I heard a squeak.

1493
01:16:43.033 --> 01:16:45.252
I'm not
the teacher's pet.

1494
01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:46.514
And I'm not yours.

1495
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:47.646
Neither is Yvette.

1496
01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.041
What's with you. man?

1497
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:54.000
It's not enough that you
have to steal Yvette.

1498
01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:55.959
but you're gonna embarrass me
in front of this one. too?

1499
01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:58.439
No. That's all you.

1500
01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:00.224
Jessica: Wings. it's fine.
Let's just go.

1501
01:17:00.311 --> 01:17:01.878
No. I'll decide
when it's fine.

1502
01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:03.531
Yeah! You decide.

1503
01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.142
You decide for everybody.
don't you?

1504
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:06.230
But not me.

1505
01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:07.623
And not my friends.

1506
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.972
So why don't you just
leave us alone?

1507
01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:10.582
Make me.

1508
01:17:12.584 --> 01:17:14.542

What the hell
are you doing?

I'm sick of it. man.
I'm sick of his shit.

1516
01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:35.955
Yeah. totally.
but you're about to get
a whole lot more of it.

1517

Do you even know
how to fight?

1518
01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:39.045
Nope.

have to do this.

is somehow about Maddy.

patch things up

and talk with her.

to look out for me.

And I messed us all up.

my advice?

Don't take my advice.

your advice was pretty good.

not quitting.

Hmm.
