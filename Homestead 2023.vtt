3
00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.972
You gotta keep it steady.

4
00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:29.088
I know. - You don't know.

5
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.498
Now listen. you're gonna hold it steady

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.331
right there. all right.

7
00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:32.560
Listen to me. - Yes.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.401
All right? - I'm listening.

9
00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:34.668
I don't want to tell you twice.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.291
I'm always listening.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.840
Keep it steady. all right?

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.580
I am keeping it steady.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.027
Nice and steady.

14
00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.532
Goddamnit.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.148
All right. come on.

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.610
get it up there again. all right?

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.134
Brian. you're shaking.

18
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.686
What. you scared the can's gonna get you?

19
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.678
You know what. shut your trap. Irene.

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.597
God. I ain't scared of no can.

21
00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:13.713
Brian. you gotta pull back slow.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.903
I pulled it back.

23
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.030
I had just told you to shut your trap.

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.913
It's my turn.

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.373
Yes ma'am.

26
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.353
Keep it steady.

27
00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:40.500
You missed it.

28
00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.634
No I didn't.

29
00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.940
Hey. you guys're supposed to be family.

30
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.040
Start acting like it.

31
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.283
She were-

32
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.408
What?

33
00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:04.458
Teasing you?

34
00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:06.408
Just 'cause she treat you like a baby

35
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.710
doesn't mean you act like one.

36
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.248
Irene. you need to
start treating your brother

37
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.813
with some respect.

38
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.790
Come on. Brian.

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.240
We gotta go clear that tree.

40
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.003
Did you start it?

41
00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:26.867
'Course I did.

42
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.323
Ma?

43
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.226
Ma?

44
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.693
There's a man coming up the road.

45
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.053
Who is he. Ma?

46
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.823
I don't know.

47
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.203
Howdy.

48
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.193
Howdy. mister.

49
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.093
Name's Jonathan.

50
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.463
Jonathan Redmond.

51
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.910
What brings you up this way. Mr. Redmond?

52
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.280
Well. I'm a surveyor
for the Pacific Company

53
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.482
and we're looking to maybe
have a line come through here.

54
00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:29.560
I don't want no train
coming through here.

55
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.563
Irene. be friendly.

56
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.833
Well the company might be
looking to take out an easement.

57
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.715
I was hoping I could
maybe take a look around.

58
00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:43.995
I think you better talk
to my husband about that.

59
00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:45.273
He's just on up the way.

60
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.573
Irene. show him to your Pa.

61
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.773
My pleasure.

62
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.693
Come on.

63
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.853
I see you got revolver.

64
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:02.430
I do.

65
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.723
Is it for protection?

66
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.753
It is.

67
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.210
So you see a lot of bandits
out while you're surveying?

68
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.770
Not yet.

69
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.210
That's disappointing.

70
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.280
I'd like to see a bandit.

71
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.570
And why is that?

72
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.340
So I could kill one.

73
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.368
I'd like to kill my father.

74
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.610
but he's out in Reno right now.

75
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.610
Ain't you taking me to him right now?

76
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.413
No. that's my Pa.

77
00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:26.508
He's my Ma's second husband.

78
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.328
My father. he tried to
kill me and my brother.

79
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.208
so in the middle of the night.

80
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.790
we left for Tulsa.

81
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.490
One day I'm gonna kill my father.

82
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.200
And why are you saying this?

83
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.780
I'm saying I got no
bones about killing nobody.

84
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.838
and we came a long way out here

85
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.828
to get away from all that trouble.

86
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.590
and trains bring trouble.

87
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.977
That's all I'm saying.

88
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.413
So do you always make
threats to people who come by?

89
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.720
Only people worth making threats to.

90
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.900
I'll take it as a compliment.

91
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.280
I don't like your tone. mister.

92
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.985
I find it awfully disrespectful.

93
00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:58.548
I shot a rabbit just this
morning straight through the eye.

94
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.333
Have to say. miss.
that's real impressive.

95
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.183
It is.

96
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.563
Your sister's got a fire in her.

97
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.000
Sometimes she thinks
pretty highly of herself.

98
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.123
Yeah.

99
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.783
Maybe you should think
a little higher of yourself.

100
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.017
Sure.

101
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.673
It's a nice pile.

102
00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:34.827
"Nice pile"?

103
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.920
Yeah. it's nice.

104
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.803
Nice pile.

105
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.280
Hey. Pa.

106
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.908
There's a man coming up
here to drive an iron bullet

107
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.480
right through our slice of heaven on earth.

108
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.363
Howdy.

109
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.343
Howdy.

110
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.873
Thanks. Irene.

111
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.980
Thank you. miss.

112
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.073
Sure.

113
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.360
Jonathan Redmond.

114
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.760
I'm a surveyor for the Pacific Company.

115
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.950
I was hoping to have a look around.

116
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.050
possibly looking to take out an easement.

117
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.570
Well. then you can have a look around.

118
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.650
I don't know if I'll grant you one.

119
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.190
Might just have to
take one from you. then.

120
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.443
Hell. you can try.

121
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.823
Supper ready?

122
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.873
Nearly.

123
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.500
I'm gonna grab a little something.

124
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.273
Gotta get that heifer in before
the bull comes in tomorrow.

125
00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:54.911
What?

126
00:06:57.993 --> 00:07:02.993
You really think we can
make a ranch out of this place?

127
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.053
Of course I do.

128
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.450
Well. once that bull comes in.

129
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.883
we can start making babies.

130
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.861
Well. in that case.

131
00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:13.098
we could've used couple more rooms

132
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.290
instead of you spending money on that bull.

133
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.633
I will build you eight more rooms.

134
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.763
Three more floors.

135
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.930
I got the money. Beth.

136
00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:27.627
Don't you worry.

137
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.040
Where'd you learn that?

138
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.015
You.

139
00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:40.898
Right.

140
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:45.483
That's how you cut your
fingers off. too. right?

141
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.243
Yeah.

142
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.073
What. you don't like
eating with us or something?

143
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.550
No.

144
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.179
Just don't like eating with you.

145
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.640
Is he mad at me?

146
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.440
I don't know. why don't you ask him?

147
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.117
Why you got that twine?

148
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.223
Why do you care?

149
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.253
Just asking. Trying to be friendly.

150
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.193
Well. it's for trying things.

151
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.263
Things that use twine.

152
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.970
You can get stuff outta trees.

153
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.030
You can fix things.

154
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.440
You can fix a bucket handle

155
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.550
and you can make shoelaces.

156
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.850
You can. I don't know. tie things together.

157
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.223
Stitch up stuff.

158
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.060
You know. you never know
when you could use twine.

159
00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:16.114
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

160
00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:18.906
and I've known you my whole life.

161
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.137
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

162
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:55.023
Howdy.

163
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.060
Evening. mister.

164
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.620
Find what you were looking for?

165
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.190
Sure did. It's beautiful
land you got here.

166
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.073
Thank you.

167
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.680
You know. it's getting a
little later than I expected

168
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.720
and seven miles back to town.

169
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.550
I don't think I'll make it
back before dark. so...

170
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.160
Certainly you're welcome to the land.

171
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.070
Ain't got much room left inside for you.

172
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.253
Ain't got much left inside for myself.

173
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.883
Much obliged. miss.

174
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.290
Have you had supper yet?

175
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.460
Oh no. no. no. no.

176
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.760
That'd be imposing myself far too much.

177
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.930
Please.

178
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.170
Be nice to have some
company around here for once.

179
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.161
If I'm being honest.

180
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:45.363
I wouldn't mind some company myself.

181
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.280
Irene. could you put the lamp up?

182
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.903
I think you've forgot to fill it.

183
00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:28.536
I think you forgot to tell me to fill it.

184
00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:49.278
I apologize for the state of our home.

185
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.418
It's not quite finished yet.

186
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.257
We just been here the one summer.

187
00:11:52.307 --> 00:11:53.853
It's real lovely. miss.

188
00:11:57.206 --> 00:11:58.206
All right.

189
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.530
Bless us our heavenly father.

190
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.320
Thank you for the bounty
which we are about to partake.

191
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.453
Amen. - Amen.

192
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.698
Sure nice to having on have
an unfamiliar face round here.

193
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.270
We don't get too many house guests.

194
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.020
Pleased to have the hospitality.

195
00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:21.203
So where are you from. mister?

196
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.880
I'm from Cleveland.

197
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.090
I've heard bad things about Cleveland.

198
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.840
What have you heard?

199
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.910
Not to trust a man from Cleveland.

200
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.751
Where'd you hear that?

201
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.280
Oh. I heard it from me.

202
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.200
Irene. apologize.

203
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.310
I don't like him. Ma.

204
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.510
Apologize.

205
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.598
You better apologize.

206
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.798
I ain't apologizing to a man

207
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.118
looking to steal our home from us.

208
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.850
You apologize right now.

209
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.800
I'm just speaking what I'm thinking.

210
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.203
Well. go on and speak
it to yourself outside. then.

211
00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:52.094
Fine.

212
00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:01.590
I'll be speaking a whole
lot of things out there.

213
00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:37.197
You like guns?

214
00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:41.517
I do.

215
00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.103
Do you have any other guns around here?

216
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.410
No. just the rifle.

217
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.660
First the target and down the barrel.

218
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.263
Straighten up.

219
00:14:01.804 --> 00:14:02.971
Now that's it.

220
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.620
You can shoot if you want.

221
00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:08.049
Thanks.

222
00:14:12.277 --> 00:14:13.793
Where'd you get it?

223
00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:15.731
I bought it.

224
00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:18.014
I know that.

225
00:14:18.064 --> 00:14:20.913
There's a chance I was wrong about you.

226
00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:21.746
No. you weren't.

227
00:14:27.228 --> 00:14:29.930
Now I'm gonna need you to be nice and quiet

228
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.963
and drop that gun.

229
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.653
Goddamnit!

230
00:14:36.034 --> 00:14:38.980
Now I'm gonna need you
to turn around nice and slow

231
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.794
and walk back to the house.

232
00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:45.587
My Pa's coming.

233
00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:49.503
Why don't we go back
inside and wait for him then?

234
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.123
Turn around.

235
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.083
Come on. get!

236
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.873
I said get!

237
00:14:58.967 --> 00:15:00.972
I said I didn't like him.

238
00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:02.827
Irene!

239
00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:07.707
What do you want?

240
00:15:07.757 --> 00:15:09.315
I want you

241
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:10.798
to sit down.

242
00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:24.453
Now boy. reach on
over for your mama's hand.

243
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.323
Don't let go.

244
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.030
Keep each other going. you hear?

245
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.033
Now I need girly. get up on the table.

246
00:15:39.148 --> 00:15:44.148
Sit on your hands.

247
00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:46.910
Wow.

248
00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:49.125
Look at that.

249
00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:52.489
It's a family portrait.

250
00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:23.403
Hope it ain't too much
of a breach of hospitality.

251
00:16:25.077 --> 00:16:26.157
but I invited some friends.

252
00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:31.469
Come in!

253
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.750
Now that we got that settled.

254
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.400
might be time for introductions.

255
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.373
My name is Lewis Clark.

256
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.103
And yes. that's my real name.

257
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.493
That over there. that's Peter the Apostle.

258
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.883
on account he is so damn loyal.

259
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.253
and he do love sending them
poor souls to them Pearly Gates.

260
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.576
or wherever they might end up.

261
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.353
That skunky bastard by the door.

262
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.620
that's Enoch McCready.

263
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.040
also known as Bad Luck Nucky.

264
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.720
It's 'cause if you meet me.

265
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.670
you've had some bad luck.

266
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.393
That and he don't ever
win at cards. right. boys?

267
00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.780
And I do believe you've
already been acquainted

268
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.980
with our newest member.

269
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.280
Jonathan "Red Bone" Redmond.

270
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.808
His name supposed to
scare us or something?

271
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.613
And of course. outside
we got the big man. Big Ben.

272
00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:26.673
He ain't much of a talker.

273
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.840
Or a listener. for that matter.

274
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.683
And that right there.

275
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.733
that's Henry "The Headhunter" Goodfellow.

276
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.933
But you might know him as Robert Smith.

277
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.193
Or Pa.

278
00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:04.990
I guess you thought you
were just gonna run off

279
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.080
and live all nice like.

280
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.400
Disgusting.

281
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.243
Johnny. keep outta this.

282
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.660
This here is a family matter.

283
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.443
Let them go.

284
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.353
That's not up to me. I'm afraid.

285
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.260
And I do believe it was
you who once told me

286
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.280
that there's no negotiating with a man

287
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.043
who's got nothing to lose.

288
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.480
And from what I can see. Henry.

289
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:39.813
you got a whole hell
of a lot to lose right now.

290
00:19:45.424 --> 00:19:48.033
Nucky. say hello to Henry.

291
00:19:57.138 --> 00:19:58.221
I hate you.

292
00:19:59.453 --> 00:20:01.223
I thought you'd've run off by now.

293
00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:12.029
I seem to remember there
being a whole lot more of you.

294
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:14.819
Oh. Henry.

295
00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:20.044
Oh. Henry.

296
00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:25.965
Oh. I wish it me that got to kill you.

297
00:20:39.328 --> 00:20:40.995
What do we got here?

298
00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:46.819
Hey. don't. hey.

299
00:21:02.247 --> 00:21:04.367
So where is it?

300
00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:05.417
It's gone.

301
00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:07.178
I Spent it.

302
00:21:10.827 --> 00:21:13.627
You come all this way to
kill a mother and her children?

303
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.573
We came all this way
to collect on our debt.

304
00:21:19.628 --> 00:21:22.810
The only debts I got are
between me and the Lord.

305
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.223
Don't worry. you'll be
meeting him soon enough.

306
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.303
Then go ahead and kill me.

307
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.123
Leave them be.

308
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.640
They had nothing to do with this.

309
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.183
True.

310
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.483
No. not yet.

311
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.443
This whole family here.

312
00:21:49.466 --> 00:21:51.299
they die 'fore you do.

313
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.700
And they won't even know why.

314
00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:04.184
You wanna tell 'em why. do you?

315
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.333
You wanna tell 'em what you done.

316
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.833
People that you killed.

317
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.723
family you betrayed.

318
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.153
Stop lying to them and yourself.

319
00:22:25.809 --> 00:22:28.540
Tell 'em who the man
is they been living with.

320
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.093
I ain't that man anymore.

321
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.933
Hmm.

322
00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:40.506
I suppose you ain't.

323
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.173
I pity you.

324
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:47.290
There ain't nothing sadder than a man

325
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.893
who don't know who he is.

326
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.023
In this great world
bequeathed to us by the divine.

327
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.763
we all have our place.

328
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.693
our purpose designed by the Lord.

329
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.170
That's what makes us man.

330
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:18.513
A man who don't know
who he is ain't a man at all.

331
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.223
You see. Henry.

332
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.547
we know who we are.

333
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.370
We are the wolves who prey on the sheep

334
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.718
to keep them from straying from the herd.

335
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.422
We have our purpose.

336
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.563
You?

337
00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:51.409
You. Henry?

338
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.973
You ain't nothing anymore.

339
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.633
You're nothing but a wolf eating grass.

340
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.393
It's outside.

341
00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:13.192
By an oak tree.

342
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.574
You have become even more of a coward.

343
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.000
Johnny pick this piece of shit up.

344
00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:48.028
You keep an eye on these fine folk.

345
00:25:12.712 --> 00:25:14.388
Hey there. Big Ben.

346
00:25:17.707 --> 00:25:19.803
There's a shovel around the house.

347
00:25:22.483 --> 00:25:23.274
You get the shovel.

348
00:25:23.316 --> 00:25:25.263
You get the shovel. Nucky.

349
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:02.043
You know. your Pa over there.

350
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.360
Oh. he's a real mean son of a bitch.

351
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.810
Did you know that about him?

352
00:26:14.192 --> 00:26:16.109
He shot his best friend

353
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.003
right in the back.

354
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.093
He betrayed the only family he ever knew.

355
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.800
Funny how life is circular like that.

356
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.433
Heard all about you.

357
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.160
Yeah.

358
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.133
Second to the big man himself.

359
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.670
You could say that.

360
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.410
Hey. which one of you two are older?

361
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.293
It's you.

362
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.783
No?

363
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.090
Oh. wait. no. you must be twins.

364
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.370
I bet you're happy you're
not one of them twins

365
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.420
that are stuck together
at the hip like that.

366
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.120
It's been too long. ain't it?

367
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.003
Yeah.

368
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.832
You are looking a stretch older.

369
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.411
You were always the one
with the pretty face. Henry.

370
00:27:35.714 --> 00:27:36.547
Nucky!

371
00:27:37.506 --> 00:27:38.423
Right here.

372
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:43.054
Hey!

373
00:27:46.764 --> 00:27:47.707
Go on.

374
00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:48.693
Get digging.

375
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.883
Fine.

376
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.250
I'm gonna kill you.

377
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.402
Sorry. what was that?

378
00:28:06.387 --> 00:28:07.627
I'm gonna kill you.

379
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.994
Ah.

380
00:28:13.044 --> 00:28:16.211
You could. you could just let us go.

381
00:28:17.973 --> 00:28:19.150
We don't know you

382
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.553
and we have nothing to give you.

383
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.573
The thing is. darling.

384
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.737
I've been doing this a long time. see?

385
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.523
And everyone is always
begging for their life.

386
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.243
And I don't like it.

387
00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:50.172
I don't.

388
00:28:51.348 --> 00:28:55.330
In fact. in my experience.

389
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.453
it only serves to speed up the process.

390
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.553
Looks like Bad Luck Nucky's
having bad luck digging.

391
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.350
I'm digging.

392
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.120
And this is important.

393
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.120
And some might say this
is the most essential part

394
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.226
of this whole thing.

395
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.400
What are you doing?

396
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.250
I'm watching.

397
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.290
Making sure you're doing a good job.

398
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.490
I'm doing a fine job.

399
00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.403
Ain't so sure.

400
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.200
What do you say. Lewis?

401
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.800
Is he doing a fine job digging?

402
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.773
I'd say it's adequate.

403
00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:03.597
"Adequate."

404
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.503
I'd say you're doing an
adequate job of breathing.

405
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.777
Do you even know what
adequate means. Nucky?

406
00:30:57.988 --> 00:30:59.147
Come on!

407
00:30:59.197 --> 00:31:00.803
Damn!

408
00:31:03.146 --> 00:31:04.229
Oh. oh God!

409
00:31:10.815 --> 00:31:12.246
Son of a bitch!

410
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.037
The hell are you doing?

411
00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:21.137
Go get him!

412
00:31:21.187 --> 00:31:22.560
Son of a bitch.

413
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.593
Henry never
could stay beat for long.

414
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:42.950
No. he couldn't.

415
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.129
Thought you were the same.

416
00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:02.682
Hey!

417
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.693
I'll be damned.

418
00:32:08.877 --> 00:32:10.833
Get this thing outta my damn foot.

419
00:32:17.296 --> 00:32:19.630
Okay. nice and easy now. okay?

420
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.182
Just one. two-

421
00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:24.063
Oh. shit!

422
00:32:24.113 --> 00:32:25.609
Sweet jumping-

423
00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:27.113
Come on.

424
00:32:27.996 --> 00:32:29.388
What the hell happened here. Peter?

425
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.660
What the hell does it look like?

426
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.613
I don't know.

427
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.350
Give me the girl. I'm gonna kill her.

428
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.580
No!

429
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.100
She stabbed me in my damn foot!

430
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.330
So?

431
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.800
So I want you to shoot her!

432
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:45.633
No!

433
00:32:45.683 --> 00:32:46.516
Do it!

434
00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:48.774
No! No!

435
00:32:48.824 --> 00:32:51.433
No!

436
00:32:56.304 --> 00:33:01.304
You happy now?

437
00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:03.003
Nucky. you shot the wrong kid.

438
00:33:03.053 --> 00:33:04.533
He said the girl Nucky.

439
00:33:06.913 --> 00:33:07.704
Well. I'm sorry. damnit!

440
00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:10.008
No. it's fine. just go ahead
and shoot that bitch. too!

441
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.883
Come on! - No!

442
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.276
We ain't shooting nobody right now.

443
00:33:38.398 --> 00:33:40.065
Nucky.

444
00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:41.169
Careful.

445
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.378
Peter. I just want you to know

446
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.140
that I checked under everything

447
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.820
and I didn't find any more little girls

448
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.266
that might jump out at you.

449
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.376
Bring me the boy.

450
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.483
No! No!

451
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.290
Move again and I'll kill you.

452
00:34:25.868 --> 00:34:28.565
Ma. it's alright. we'll get him back

453
00:34:28.615 --> 00:34:29.908
I swear.

454
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:31.165
I'm sorry.

455
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.903
Lewis!

456
00:34:57.217 --> 00:34:58.050
Lewis!

457
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.623
It ain't gotta be like this!

458
00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:05.725
It's far too late for that. Henry.

459
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.340
I still consider you a brother.

460
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.363
I know that sounds strange.

461
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.523
but it's true.

462
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.433
I couldn't do it anymore.

463
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:26.073
Ain't you ever wanted
a life away from all this?

464
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.663
No more death. no more killing.

465
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.393
Anyway. you can take me.

466
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.197
I'll show you where the money
is and then you go. all right?

467
00:35:47.826 --> 00:35:49.353
It ain't my decision. Henry.

468
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.433
If it were. would you go?

469
00:35:56.646 --> 00:35:57.968
I do believe so.

470
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.763
Evenin'. son.

471
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.680
Don't you worry.

472
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.570
Your Pa plays this right.

473
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.518
you'll be digging his
grave instead of lying in it.

474
00:36:25.842 --> 00:36:27.175
Is he a good Pa?

475
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.913
Do anything for you?

476
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.993
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

477
00:36:37.556 --> 00:36:38.965
I taught him that.

478
00:36:46.276 --> 00:36:47.590
All right.

479
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.540
Maybe you should say something to him.

480
00:36:53.997 --> 00:36:54.830
Pa!

481
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.203
Don't think that's quite loud enough.

482
00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:00.112
Pa!

483
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.427
It's good to see you Henry.

484
00:37:21.687 --> 00:37:22.863
You too. brother.

485
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.963
Sounds like your Pa ran into a friend.

486
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.602
Stay with the boy. Nucky.

487
00:38:15.047 --> 00:38:15.853
C'mon!

488
00:38:45.676 --> 00:38:46.509
Hmm.

489
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.143
Can you read?

490
00:39:07.348 --> 00:39:09.593
I like books.

491
00:39:27.578 --> 00:39:28.495
Read to me.

492
00:40:12.793 --> 00:40:17.793
I was born in the year
1632 in the city of York

493
00:40:19.443 --> 00:40:21.093
of a good family.

494
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.418
though not of that country.

495
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.200
Hmm. no. not of that country.

496
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.740
I didn't say for you to stop!

497
00:40:31.727 --> 00:40:34.540
Though not of that country.

498
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.990
My father being a foreigner of Bremen.

499
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.977
Damn it. it's pronounced "bree-man"!

500
00:40:45.517 --> 00:40:50.043
"Bree-man." who settled first at Hull.

501
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.240
He got a good estate by merchandise.

502
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:20.018
You ever play horseshoes?

503
00:41:20.068 --> 00:41:21.400
What?

504
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.950
I said did you ever play
horseshoe with your Pa?

505
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.113
No.

506
00:41:28.065 --> 00:41:29.440
Huh.

507
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.140
He was always good at horseshoes.

508
00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:36.146
I figured he would've showed you.

509
00:41:50.797 --> 00:41:52.021
...English shoes and stockings.

510
00:41:52.063 --> 00:41:54.663
which were things I greatly wanted.

511
00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:59.960
but had none on my feet for many years.

512
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.790
I had. indeed. got two pair of shoes now.

513
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.569
which I took off the
feet of two drowned men

514
00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:08.379
whom I saw in the wreck.
very welcome to me.

515
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.713
and I found two pair
more in one of the chests.

516
00:42:16.547 --> 00:42:19.655
But they were not like our English shoes.

517
00:42:25.561 --> 00:42:27.311
...which were very welcome to me.

518
00:42:28.502 --> 00:42:29.839
but they were not like our-

519
00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:30.722
Drop it.

520
00:42:31.991 --> 00:42:32.824
Now!

521
00:43:36.676 --> 00:43:38.093
Where's my son?

522
00:43:40.009 --> 00:43:41.990
They still got him.

523
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.790
Don't you worry. he's safe for now.

524
00:43:45.151 --> 00:43:46.984
You don't know that.

525
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.143
Go get him right now.

526
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.250
No. we wait for 'em to come back.

527
00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:57.414
Why are you saying that?

528
00:44:00.633 --> 00:44:02.800
'Cause I know these men.

529
00:44:04.721 --> 00:44:06.554
How do you know 'em?

530
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.120
I used to be one of 'em.

531
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.863
I guess you already figured that out.

532
00:44:25.676 --> 00:44:28.267
Look I-

533
00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:31.013
I lived I-

534
00:44:31.063 --> 00:44:32.583
I grew up in an orphanage.

535
00:44:32.633 --> 00:44:35.643
That much is true.

536
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.011
And one day. uh...

537
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.050
Ezekiel came by and said
he saw something in me

538
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.666
and asked me if I wanted to go with him.

539
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:51.543
and of course I said yeah.

540
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.233
He had a whole gang of us out on the farm.

541
00:44:59.123 --> 00:45:01.683
One day we just started robbing. killing.

542
00:45:05.586 --> 00:45:10.147
I ain't gonna get into all that.

543
00:45:10.197 --> 00:45:11.733
And after we left the farm.

544
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.870
we started running.

545
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.224
and after years of running.

546
00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:21.040
I just figured I'd

547
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.300
settle down and made myself a life.

548
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.343
He never told me where
the earnings were. but...

549
00:45:34.285 --> 00:45:35.702
I knew.

550
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.620
One day I just up and took it

551
00:45:43.546 --> 00:45:45.577
and I set myself up real nice.

552
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.441
Now. that's.

553
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.987
that's when I met you.

554
00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:56.050
And I couldn't go spending it all

555
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.343
'cause that would've just created a stir.

556
00:45:59.318 --> 00:46:00.235
and then...

557
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:04.773
They found me anyway.

558
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.450
And that's why they're here.

559
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.912
for their money and my blood.

560
00:46:19.001 --> 00:46:20.334
I'm sorry. Beth.

561
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.683
I had no business getting with you.

562
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.813
You're one real bastard.

563
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.221
Where's the money?

564
00:46:40.271 --> 00:46:43.480
Beth. I-

565
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.313
After all this.

566
00:46:44.363 --> 00:46:46.710
you ain't gonna tell me
where the money is. huh?

567
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.200
What do you think you're gonna do?

568
00:46:52.283 --> 00:46:55.173
Are you gonna go and
you gonna beat all them?

569
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.213
Chase 'em down?

570
00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:00.679
What's your plan?

571
00:47:00.729 --> 00:47:02.468
Come on. Beth.

572
00:47:02.518 --> 00:47:03.309
You know. I'd give 'em the money.

573
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:06.783
I just. I'm just a man.

574
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.027
My son is out there

575
00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:11.568
and they want what you took from them.

576
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.780
You gonna give it to 'em. you hear me?

577
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.070
Yeah. all right.

578
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.911
Where's the money?

579
00:47:15.953 --> 00:47:18.250
It's under the floorboards. all right?

580
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.493
Right there under the house.

581
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:22.440
It's not nailed down.

582
00:47:25.735 --> 00:47:26.568
Damn you.

583
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:28.943
Irene.

584
00:47:30.262 --> 00:47:31.762
Go on and get it.

585
00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:40.559
Ezekiel!

586
00:49:42.657 --> 00:49:44.043
You tell Nucky.

587
00:49:45.496 --> 00:49:47.688
if that two-bit huckster of a
dog. they take another step.

588
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.380
I'm gonna blow your
head off and theirs. too.

589
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.850
You want your boy back?

590
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.620
Take another step.

591
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.940
make another move I don't like.

592
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.340
it better be their hands
in the sky praying to God.

593
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.945
because that's the last chance they'll get.

594
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.180
I'm gonna approach the house.

595
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.313
hands to God.

596
00:50:09.013 --> 00:50:11.583
I don't need you going
and taking my head off.

597
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.703
Got three bags of your sin in here.

598
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.010
You send my boy back
to me and you can have it.

599
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.683
I hope I'm incorrect.

600
00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:30.123
but I believe you have the body

601
00:50:30.173 --> 00:50:32.585
of dear brother Peter in there.

602
00:50:32.635 --> 00:50:34.685
Need to be giving him a Christian burial.

603
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.743
Come in here and get him.

604
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.613
You bring him. and the money. too.

605
00:50:42.463 --> 00:50:45.370
I ain't stepping in that house.

606
00:50:57.322 --> 00:50:58.448
Keep your hands up. boys.

607
00:50:58.498 --> 00:50:59.998
Yeah. keep 'em up.

608
00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:37.898
I got you. I got you!

609
00:52:37.948 --> 00:52:39.875
Come on now.

610
00:52:48.483 --> 00:52:51.050
It is good to see you. Henry.

611
00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:54.528
You could've written.

612
00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.673
Go!

613
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.570
Much obliged.

614
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:12.953
Oh.

615
00:53:53.737 --> 00:53:55.320
He was a bad man.

616
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.473
What happened tonight.

617
00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:08.733
that was on him.

618
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.233
That was his sin coming back. kids.

619
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.268
If it had been one of y'all instead of him.

620
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:22.023
I'd done killed him myself.

621
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.050
He's done bad things with very bad people.

622
00:54:34.342 --> 00:54:39.153
He doomed us. since the
day that we got married.

623
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.530
My brothers. let us attend to you

624
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.563
as you begin your eternal descent.

625
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.693
May the gates of hell open at your whisper.

626
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.380
May we. the forsaken and lost.

627
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.670
mourn not your life.

628
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.413
but your deeds and your deeds unfinished.

629
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.500
Now. tomorrow morning.

630
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.643
before that crew bring in that bull.

631
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.123
we gonna bury him.

632
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:30.140
and we gonna do it right.

633
00:55:35.882 --> 00:55:37.632
And then we're gonna.

634
00:55:39.253 --> 00:55:40.953
we're gonna catch a ride into town

635
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.923
and a stage coach to Tulsa.

636
00:55:53.247 --> 00:55:57.167
We're gonna. we're gonna
have to start a whole new life

637
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:00.144
again by ourselves.

638
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.203
Wherever you want.

639
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.590
You wanna stay here
while they're out there?

640
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.593
I wanna keep you safe.

641
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.510
I gotta to keep you safe.

642
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:20.718
Yeah Pa was the one that did that.

643
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.200
and now he's dead.

644
00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:30.730
May I spill my blood for you

645
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.816
as yours has been shed for me.

646
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:46.083
As you have bled. so shall I.

647
00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.053
Ashes to ashes.

648
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.280
My brothers. we came here for one purpose.

649
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.380
and that was to retrieve our honor

650
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:09.010
from the bloodstained
hands of he who took it.

651
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.720
And yet two of our
brothers lie dead before us.

652
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:17.230
their lives unduly taken by Judas himself.

653
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.810
the man who left the
only family he ever knew

654
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.683
just so he could steal one for himself.

655
00:57:25.889 --> 00:57:30.640
That family. those children. that woman.

656
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.133
they just over that hill.

657
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.673
We came for respect.

658
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.663
We stay for retribution.

659
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.123
I'm gonna kill 'em.

660
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:52.953
Get that outta your head right now.

661
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:54.860
Don't say that.

662
00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.620
They come in here.

663
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.330
take us captive.

664
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.023
kill Pa and kidnap my brother.

665
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.960
and you just wanna let that pass by?

666
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.240
You think you're gonna
hunt down a gang of outlaws?

667
00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.409
You gonna kill 'em one by one?

668
00:58:12.459 --> 00:58:13.292
Yes.

669
00:58:14.772 --> 00:58:17.192
I didn't raise murderers.

670
00:58:17.242 --> 00:58:18.159
Too late.

671
00:58:20.867 --> 00:58:22.360
I gotta protect you.

672
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.173
Oh. you've done a hell of a job at that.

673
00:58:30.479 --> 00:58:32.380
I think it's best we
all just get some sleep.

674
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.688
I ain't sleeping tonight. Ma.

675
00:58:34.738 --> 00:58:36.550
They gone. Irene.

676
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.570
We don't know that.

677
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.633
We should go.

678
00:58:38.683 --> 00:58:41.725
I say we stayin'. we stayin'.

679
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.013
If you think they gone.
why are you scared. then?

680
00:59:40.552 --> 00:59:42.190
What are they doing?

681
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.590
I think it's a tea party.

682
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:54.260
They ain't here.

683
00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:56.873
They're gone.

684
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:01.210
How long did it take
you to figure that one out?

685
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:10.470
Where do you wanna go?

686
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.733
You wanna go to Chicago?

687
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:15.190
You always were saying you wanna go

688
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.840
somewhere something's happening.

689
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.397
I want go to Robinson Crusoe's island.

690
01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:26.650
There ain't no one out there.

691
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.840
Just no one to bug us.

692
01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.113
Just us and goats.

693
01:00:31.984 --> 01:00:34.313
That sounds real nice.

694
01:00:34.363 --> 01:00:36.723
Ain't they got cannibals on that island?

695
01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:47.605
You find 'em?

696
01:00:47.655 --> 01:00:49.353
Someone's got a limp.

697
01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.053
Stay back and see if
Henry left anything else.

698
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.940
He was talking to you.

699
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.967
No he didn't.

700
01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.850
You stay. I ain't staying.

701
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.133
Flip a coin?

702
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.983
Fine.

703
01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.413
Heads.

704
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.565
Bad luck.

705
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.208
Ma. they got our tracks.

706
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:36.572
We gotta run.

707
01:01:36.622 --> 01:01:38.320
No. we can't run.

708
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.300
Brian can't run.

709
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.201
If they're gonna find us.

710
01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:43.388
they're gonna find us sooner or later.

711
01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.250
Then we kill 'em.

712
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.362
No. no.

713
01:01:45.412 --> 01:01:46.778
Let them pass by.

714
01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.474
You should just go.

715
01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:49.600
No. no.

716
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.867
We ain't gonna leave you. Brian.

717
01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.053
Brian. Brian. what are you doing?

718
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.583
If we can get back to the house. right?

719
01:01:57.633 --> 01:01:59.410
It's the only place they checked.

720
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.530
It's the only place they know we ain't.

721
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.577
Yeah. all right.

722
01:02:11.387 --> 01:02:14.887
You never know when you need some twine.

723
01:02:24.753 --> 01:02:25.575
Let's go!

724
01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:26.570
Come on!

725
01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:00.498
Wait here.

726
01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:02.122
Wait here.

727
01:03:02.172 --> 01:03:03.080
Okay.

728
01:03:35.893 --> 01:03:37.596
All right. Come on.

729
01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:38.660
Come on.

730
01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.406
We're safe now.

731
01:03:57.456 --> 01:03:59.438
Don't lie to me. Ma.

732
01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:00.902
They ain't here.

733
01:04:00.952 --> 01:04:02.347
And if we left when we said we would.

734
01:04:02.389 --> 01:04:04.722
we wouldn't be here. either.

735
01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:09.389
You should've.

736
01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.359
